Tell me oh Lord  You want me to give Your life  To the world where there’s no hopeTell me oh Lord  how You want me to give Your loveTo the world where love went coldDo you see all the people sinking downDon’t you see people aching in the darkness aloneSend me Lord  send me Lord  I am willing to give allSend me out to those who need Your HandFill me Lord  fill me Lord  fill me with Your Love for allReach Your Hand to hold them once again
