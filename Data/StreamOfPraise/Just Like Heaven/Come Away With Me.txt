Come away with Me, My love,   My doveCome away with Me, My beautiful  oneFor the rain is  over and  winter is  goneFlowers bloom, the  season of  singing has come My  beautiful one, the time of  singing has  comeLet Me  wipe away your tearsRemove all your fearsLet Me hear your  voice calling  Me
