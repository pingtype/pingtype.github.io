Dark But Lovely - ⿊卻秀美Sarah EdwardsI can’t understand this work of grace我不能明⽩恩典⼤能How a perfect God would come and take my place完美的神竟願代替我The stars, they don’t move You The waves can’t undo You星宿不能搖動祢海浪不能停⽌祢The mountains and their splendor They cannot steal Your heart眾⼭脈雖然壯麗不能偷取祢的⼼This God, who is holy perfect in beauty這聖潔的真神完全⼜美麗Awesome in glory is ravished by my heart榮耀⽽威嚴被我的⼼奪去Though I'm poor You say I am lovely我雖然貧窮祢説我可愛Though I'm dark You say I am beautiful我雖然黝⿊祢説我美麗Somehow my weak glance has overwhelmed You輕輕的⼀瞥已叫祢驚嘆Somehow my weak love, it has stolen a way Your heart我微⼩的愛卻能偷取了祢的⼼
