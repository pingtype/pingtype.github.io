Beauty, Beauty 榮美 榮美David BrymerIn the beginning was the Word the One we have seen and we have heard創世之初道已常存我們曾看⾒也聽⾒The only Begotten of the Father是天⽗所愛的獨⽣兒⼦You are my one and only Son Not my will but Yours be done祢是我的獨⽣愛⼦願祢旨意今⽇成全All we can do is stand in wonder and sing我們唯有站立⽽讚嘆⾼唱Beauty, beauty, beautiful Glory, glory, glorious榮美榮美真榮美榮耀榮耀真榮耀You are You are是祢是祢Who has believed and who has seen? The suffering Servant is our King誰曾相信誰曾看⾒受苦僕⼈竟是君王Though we despised You, You have loved us雖我厭棄祢祢仍愛我The Branch of the Lord has been revealed主的枝⼦已經顯明and by Your wounds, we have been healed因祢鞭傷我得醫治All of the nations stand in wonder and sing列國萬邦站立⽽讚嘆⾼唱Take me into Your throne room帶我來到祢寶座前Let me see Your beauty let me see Your face渴慕⾒祢榮美渴慕⾒祢⾯
