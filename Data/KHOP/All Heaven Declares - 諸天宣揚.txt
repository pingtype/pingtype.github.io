All Heaven Declares 諸天宣揚Noel RichardsAll heaven declares the glory of the risen Lord諸天宣揚復活之主的榮耀Who can compare with the beauty of the Lord誰能相比我主聖潔美麗Forever You will be the Lamb upon the throne 永遠到永遠羔⽺已掌權I gladly bow the knee and worship You alone今我歡喜前來向祢屈膝敬拜I will proclaim the glory of the risen Lord我要宣揚復活之主的榮耀Who once was slain to reconcile man to God祂曾被殺為救贖⼈歸於神
