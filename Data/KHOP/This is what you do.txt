This is what you doBethel MusicIt’s always like springtime with You最美好是和祢⼀起Making all things new⼀切都更新Your light is breaking through the dark 祢亮光能打破⿊暗This love it is sweeter than wine祢愛給我喜樂⽣命Bringing joy, bringing life比美酒更甜蜜Your hope is rising like the dawn 祢希望升起像黎明This is what You do祢給我⽣命This is what You do祢給我⽣命You make me come alive祢讓我活過來It’s like I’m living for the first time 就像我重新活過⼀遍Finally living for the first time終於我重新活過⼀遍I will dance I will dance Unashamed從祢⽽來的⽣命就值得我們歡呼慶賀
