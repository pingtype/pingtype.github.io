Dance Into The Land - 跳舞進應許地Leonard JonesWarring in the Spirit With weapons formed of praise屬靈爭戰勝利以讚美為兵器Hear the sound of the enemy Fleeing seven ways 聽⾒仇敵的腳步聲四散已逃跑Like David did, we will dance with all our might 如同⼤衛我們盡全⼒跳舞Like Joshua, with a shout, he won the fight 像約書亞揚聲⼀呼即得勝Like Miriam, with a timbrel in her hand 像米利暗⼿搖著鈴⿎歡呼We will dance into the land ⿑跳舞進應許地Spoiling powers of darkness攻掠⿊暗權勢He brought us out with silver and with gold 將豐盛祝福賞賜給教會And the gates of hell will not prevail They will surely fall 陰間權柄不能勝過全都要墜落The Captain of the Lord of Hosts Through the pow'r of the Holy Ghost 萬軍之主耶和華藉著聖靈的⼤能Overcoming all His enemies 祂已戰勝所有的仇敵Binding kings with chains We declare that Jesus reigns 綑綁眾魔君宣告耶穌已掌權Over powers and principalities 超越⼀切執政和掌權
