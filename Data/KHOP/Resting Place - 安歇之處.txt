Resting Place - 安歇之處Brian Doerksen Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool 天是我座位地是我的腳凳Where is the house you will build for me?你們要為我造何等殿宇？Whom of you will hear the cry of my heart 有誰曾聽⾒我⼼的呼求Where will my resting place be?何處是我安歇居所？Here oh Lord, have I prepared for You a home在這裡我願為祢預備居所Long have I desired for You to dwell我渴慕願能與祢同在Here oh Lord, have I prepared a resting place在這裡我願為祢預備安歇之處Here oh Lord, I wait for You alone在這裡我單單等候祢
