Better Is One DayMatt RedmanHow lovely is Your dwelling place, O Lord Almighty祢的居所何等美好全能主上帝For my soul longs and even faint for You我靈渴慕我⼼為祢著迷For here my heart is satisfied within Your presence因祢同在使我的⼼能得著滿⾜I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings在祢翅膀蔭庇下我歌唱Better is one day in Your courts Better is one day is You house願住在祢的院中⼀⽇願住在祢的殿中⼀⽇Better is one day in Your courts than thousands elsewhere願住在祢的院中⼀⽇勝世上千⽇One thing I ask and I would seek to see Your beauty有⼀件事我要尋求瞻仰祢榮美to find You in the place Your glory dwells在祢榮耀同在之處經歷祢My heart and flesh cry out for You, the living God⽤我全⼼全⼒向祢我神呼求Your Spirit's water to my soul讓聖靈活⽔充滿我I've tasted and I've seen, come once again to me讓主恩典滋味再次能臨到我I will draw near to You I will draw near to You to You讓我來親近祢讓我來親近祢親近祢Better is one day, better is one dayBetter is one day than thousands elsewhere
