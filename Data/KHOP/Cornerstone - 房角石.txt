Cornerstone - 房⾓⽯HillsongMy hope is built on nothing less than Jesus blood and righteousness我⼼所望無別根基唯獨耶穌公義寶⾎I dare not trust the sweetest frame but wholly trust in Jesus’ name世上⼀切無法依靠唯全然靠耶穌聖名Christ alone, cornerstone Weak made strong in the Saviour’s love唯獨主我磐⽯主愛中我變剛強Through the storm, He is Lord Lord of all風暴中祂是主萬有之主When Darkness seems to hide His face, I rest on His unchanging grace當⿊暗似已掩主⾯我仍安息主恩不變In every high and stormy gale, My anchor holds within the veil在狂風暴雨風浪中我緊靠牢在主裡⾯When He shall come with trumpet sound, O may I then in Him be found末⽇聽⾒號⾓響起願我被尋⾒在主裡Dressed in His righteousness alone, Faultless stand before the throne穿戴救主公義外袍聖潔無瑕立寶座前
