Did You Feel The Mountain Tremble? - 你是否感到群⼭震動Martin Smith  Did you feel the mountains tremble? Did you hear the ocean roar? 你是否感到群⼭震動聽⾒⼤海在怒吼When the people rose to sing of Jesus Christ, the Risen One 萬⺠都在揚聲⾼唱耶穌基督已復活Did you feel the people tremble? Did you hear the singers roar?你是否感到⼈⼼惶恐聽⾒萬⺠在歌頌When the lost began to sing of Jesus Christ, the Saving One世上⼈們開始呼喊耶穌基督我救主And we can see that God, You’re moving 我們看⾒神⼤能運⾏A mighty river through the nations 活⽔江河正流向萬邦And young and old will turn to Jesus 男女老幼都轉向耶穌Fling wide you heavenly gate 天堂⼤⾨正敞開Prepare the way of the risen Lo rd來預備復活救主降臨Open up the doors, let the music play 天堂⾨打開⾳樂響起來Let the streets resound with singing讓讚美充滿這世界Songs that bring Your hope, songs that bring Your joy 唱出新盼望喜樂湧上來Dancers who dance upon in justice歡呼祂的公義永存在Do you feel the darkness tremble? When all the saints join in one song?⿊暗勢⼒正在顫抖讓全百姓同⼼歌頌And all the streams flow as one river to wash away our brokenness⼭川⼩溪匯成河流洗淨⼀切破碎憂愁
