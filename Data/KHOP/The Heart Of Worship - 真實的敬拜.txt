The Heart Of Worship - 真實的敬拜Matt Redman  When the music fades, all is stripped away and I simply come當⾳樂消散⼀切都過去我來就近祢Longing just to bring something that's of worth that will bless Your heart渴望獻給祢我⽣命所有使祢⼼滿⾜I'll bring You more than a song, for a song in itself我所願獻上給祢勝於⼀切詩歌is not what You have required因那本非祢所要You search much deeper within through the way things appear祢鑒察我靈深處過於我的外表You're looking into my heart祢看重我的內⼼I'm coming back to the heart of worship我再次獻上真實的敬拜And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus單單來敬拜祢全然為祢耶穌I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it求赦免我過去眼⽬偏離When it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus現今來敬拜祢全然為祢耶穌King of endless worth, no one could express how much You deserve尊貴的君王祢何等配得無⼈能相比Though I'm weak and poor, all I have is Yours, every single breath雖貧窮軟弱我所有⼀切全都屬於祢
