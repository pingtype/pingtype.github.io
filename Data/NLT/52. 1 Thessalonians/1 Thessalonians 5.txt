1 I really don't need to write to you about how and when all this will happen, dear brothers and sisters.[a] 2For you know quite well that the day of the Lord will come unexpectedly, like a thief in the night.  3When people are saying, "All is well; everything is peaceful and secure," then disaster will fall upon them as suddenly as a woman's birth pains begin when her child is about to be born. And there will be no escape.4But you aren't in the dark about these things, dear brothers and sisters, and you won't be surprised when the day of the Lord comes like a thief.  5For you are all children of the light and of the day; we don't belong to darkness and night.  6So be on your guard, not asleep like the others. Stay alert and be sober.  7Night is the time for sleep and the time when people get drunk.  8But let us who live in the light think clearly, protected by the body armor of faith and love, and wearing as our helmet the confidence of our salvation.  9For God decided to save us through our Lord Jesus Christ, not to pour out his anger on us.  10He died for us so that we can live with him forever, whether we are dead or alive at the time of his return.  11So encourage each other and build each other up, just as you are already doing.12Dear brothers and sisters, honor those who are your leaders in the Lord's work. They work hard among you and warn you against all that is wrong.  13Think highly of them and give them your wholehearted love because of their work. And remember to live peaceably with each other.14Brothers and sisters, we urge you to warn those who are lazy. Encourage those who are timid. Take tender care of those who are weak. Be patient with everyone.15See that no one pays back evil for evil, but always try to do good to each other and to everyone else.16Always be joyful.  17Keep on praying.  18No matter what happens, always be thankful, for this is God's will for you who belong to Christ Jesus.19Do not stifle the Holy Spirit.  20Do not scoff at prophecies,  21but test everything that is said. Hold on to what is good.  22Keep away from every kind of evil.23Now may the God of peace make you holy in every way, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless until that day when our Lord Jesus Christ comes again.  24God, who calls you, is faithful; he will do this.25Dear brothers and sisters, pray for us.26Greet all the brothers and sisters in Christian love.[b]27I command you in the name of the Lord to read this letter to all the brothers and sisters.28And may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you.
