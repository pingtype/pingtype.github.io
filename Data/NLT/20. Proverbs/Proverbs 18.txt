1 Unfriendly people care only about themselves; they lash out at common sense.2 Fools have no interest in understanding; they only want to air their own opinions.3 Doing wrong leads to disgrace, and scandalous behavior brings contempt.4 Wise words are like deep waters; wisdom flows from the wise like a bubbling brook.5 It is not right to acquit the guilty or deny justice to the innocent.6 Fools' words get them into constant quarrels; they are asking for a beating.7 The mouths of fools are their ruin; they trap themselves with their lips.8 Rumors are dainty morsels that sink deep into one's heart.9 A lazy person is as bad as someone who destroys things.10 The name of the Lord  is a strong fortress; the godly run to him and are safe.11 The rich think of their wealth as a strong defense; they imagine it to be a high wall of safety.12 Haughtiness goes before destruction; humility precedes honor.13 Spouting off before listening to the facts is both shameful and foolish.14 The human spirit can endure a sick body, but who can bear a crushed spirit?15 Intelligent people are always ready to learn. Their ears are open for knowledge.16 Giving a gift can open doors; it gives access to important people!17 The first to speak in court sounds right- until the cross-examination begins.18 Flipping a coin* can end arguments; it settles disputes between powerful opponents.19 An offended friend is harder to win back than a fortified city. Arguments separate friends like a gate locked with bars.20 Wise words satisfy like a good meal; the right words bring satisfaction.21 The tongue can bring death or life; those who love to talk will reap the consequences.22 The man who finds a wife finds a treasure, and he receives favor from the Lord .23 The poor plead for mercy; the rich answer with insults.24 There are "friends" who destroy each other, but a real friend sticks closer than a brother.       Footnotes: 18:18 Hebrew Casting lots.
