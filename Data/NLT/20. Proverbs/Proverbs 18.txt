1 A recluse is self-indulgent, snarling at every sound principle of conduct.2Fools have no interest in understanding; they only want to air their own opinions.3When the wicked arrive, contempt, shame, and disgrace are sure to follow.4A person's words can be life-giving water; words of true wisdom are as refreshing as a bubbling brook.5It is wrong for a judge to favor the guilty or condemn the innocent.6Fools get into constant quarrels; they are asking for a beating.7The mouths of fools are their ruin; their lips get them into trouble.8What dainty morsels rumors are--but they sink deep into one's heart.9A lazy person is as bad as someone who destroys things.10The name of the LORD is a strong fortress; the godly run to him and are safe.11The rich think of their wealth as an impregnable defense; they imagine it is a high wall of safety.12Haughtiness goes before destruction; humility precedes honor.13What a shame, what folly, to give advice before listening to the facts!14The human spirit can endure a sick body, but who can bear it if the spirit is crushed?15Intelligent people are always open to new ideas. In fact, they look for them.16Giving a gift works wonders; it may bring you before important people!17Any story sounds true until someone sets the record straight.18Casting lots can end arguments and settle disputes between powerful opponents.19It's harder to make amends with an offended friend than to capture a fortified city. Arguments separate friends like a gate locked with iron bars.20Words satisfy the soul as food satisfies the stomach; the right words on a person's lips bring satisfaction.21Those who love to talk will experience the consequences, for the tongue can kill or nourish life.22The man who finds a wife finds a treasure and receives favor from the LORD.23The poor plead for mercy; the rich answer with insults.24There are "friends" who destroy each other, but a real friend sticks closer than a brother.
