1 To learn, you must love discipline; it is stupid to hate correction.2The LORD approves of those who are good, but he condemns those who plan wickedness.3Wickedness never brings stability; only the godly have deep roots.4A worthy wife is her husband's joy and crown; a shameful wife saps his strength.5The plans of the godly are just; the advice of the wicked is treacherous.6The words of the wicked are like a murderous ambush, but the words of the godly save lives.7The wicked perish and are gone, but the children of the godly stand firm.8Everyone admires a person with good sense, but a warped mind is despised.9It is better to be a nobody with a servant than to be self-important but have no food.10The godly are concerned for the welfare of their animals, but even the kindness of the wicked is cruel.11Hard work means prosperity; only fools idle away their time.12Thieves are jealous of each other's loot, while the godly bear their own fruit.13The wicked are trapped by their own words, but the godly escape such trouble.14People can get many good things by the words they say; the work of their hands also gives them many benefits.15Fools think they need no advice, but the wise listen to others.16A fool is quick-tempered, but a wise person stays calm when insulted.17An honest witness tells the truth; a false witness tells lies.18Some people make cutting remarks, but the words of the wise bring healing.19Truth stands the test of time; lies are soon exposed.20Deceit fills hearts that are plotting evil; joy fills hearts that are planning peace!21No real harm befalls the godly, but the wicked have their fill of trouble.22The LORD hates those who don't keep their word, but he delights in those who do.23Wise people don't make a show of their knowledge, but fools broadcast their folly.24Work hard and become a leader; be lazy and become a slave.25Worry weighs a person down; an encouraging word cheers a person up.26The godly give good advice to their friends;[a] the wicked lead them astray.27Lazy people don't even cook the game they catch, but the diligent make use of everything they find.28The way of the godly leads to life; their path does not lead to death.
