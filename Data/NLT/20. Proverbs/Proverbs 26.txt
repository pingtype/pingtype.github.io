1 Honor doesn't go with fools any more than snow with summer or rain with harvest.2Like a fluttering sparrow or a darting swallow, an unfair curse will not land on its intended victim.3Guide a horse with a whip, a donkey with a bridle, and a fool with a rod to his back!4When arguing with fools, don't answer their foolish arguments, or you will become as foolish as they are.5When arguing with fools, be sure to answer their foolish arguments, or they will become wise in their own estimation.6Trusting a fool to convey a message is as foolish as cutting off one's feet or drinking poison!7In the mouth of a fool, a proverb becomes as limp as a paralyzed leg.8Honoring a fool is as foolish as tying a stone to a slingshot.9A proverb in a fool's mouth is as dangerous as a thornbush brandished by a drunkard.10An employer who hires a fool or a bystander is like an archer who shoots recklessly.11As a dog returns to its vomit, so a fool repeats his folly.12There is more hope for fools than for people who think they are wise.13The lazy person is full of excuses, saying, "I can't go outside because there might be a lion on the road! Yes, I'm sure there's a lion out there!"14As a door turns back and forth on its hinges, so the lazy person turns over in bed.15Some people are so lazy that they won't lift a finger to feed themselves.16Lazy people consider themselves smarter than seven wise counselors.17Yanking a dog's ears is as foolish as interfering in someone else's argument.18Just as damaging as a mad man shooting a lethal weapon  19is someone who lies to a friend and then says, "I was only joking."20Fire goes out for lack of fuel, and quarrels disappear when gossip stops.21A quarrelsome person starts fights as easily as hot embers light charcoal or fire lights wood.22What dainty morsels rumors are--but they sink deep into one's heart.23Smooth[a] words may hide a wicked heart, just as a pretty glaze covers a common clay pot.24People with hate in their hearts may sound pleasant enough, but don't believe them.  25Though they pretend to be kind, their hearts are full of all kinds of evil.  26While their hatred may be concealed by trickery, it will finally come to light for all to see.27If you set a trap for others, you will get caught in it yourself. If you roll a boulder down on others, it will roll back and crush you.28A lying tongue hates its victims, and flattery causes ruin.
