1Listen as wisdom calls out! Hear as understanding raises her voice!  2She stands on the hilltop and at the crossroads.  3At the entrance to the city, at the city gates, she cries aloud,  4"I call to you, to all of you! I am raising my voice to all people.  5How naive you are! Let me give you common sense. O foolish ones, let me give you understanding.  6Listen to me! For I have excellent things to tell you. Everything I say is right,  7for I speak the truth and hate every kind of deception.  8My advice is wholesome and good. There is nothing crooked or twisted in it.  9My words are plain to anyone with understanding, clear to those who want to learn.10"Choose my instruction rather than silver, and knowledge over pure gold.  11For wisdom is far more valuable than rubies. Nothing you desire can be compared with it.12"I, Wisdom, live together with good judgment. I know where to discover knowledge and discernment. 13All who fear the LORD will hate evil. That is why I hate pride, arrogance, corruption, and perverted speech. 14Good advice and success belong to me. Insight and strength are mine.  15Because of me, kings reign, and rulers make just laws.  16Rulers lead with my help, and nobles make righteous judgments.17"I love all who love me. Those who search for me will surely find me.  18Unending riches, honor, wealth, and justice are mine to distribute.  19My gifts are better than the purest gold, my wages better than sterling silver!  20I walk in righteousness, in paths of justice.  21Those who love me inherit wealth, for I fill their treasuries.22"The LORD formed me from the beginning, before he created anything else.  23I was appointed in ages past, at the very first, before the earth began.  24I was born before the oceans were created, before the springs bubbled forth their waters.  25Before the mountains and the hills were formed, I was born--  26before he had made the earth and fields and the first handfuls of soil.27"I was there when he established the heavens, when he drew the horizon on the oceans.  28I was there when he set the clouds above, when he established the deep fountains of the earth.  29I was there when he set the limits of the seas, so they would not spread beyond their boundaries. And when he marked off the earth's foundations,  30I was the architect at his side. I was his constant delight, rejoicing always in his presence.  31And how happy I was with what he created--his wide world and all the human family!32"And so, my children,[a] listen to me, for happy are all who follow my ways.  33Listen to my counsel and be wise. Don't ignore it.34"Happy are those who listen to me, watching for me daily at my gates, waiting for me outside my home! 35For whoever finds me finds life and wins approval from the LORD.  36But those who miss me have injured themselves. All who hate me love death."
