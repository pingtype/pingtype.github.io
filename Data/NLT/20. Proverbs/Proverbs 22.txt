1 Choose a good reputation over great riches, for being held in high esteem is better than having silver or gold.2The rich and the poor have this in common: The LORD made them both.3A prudent person foresees the danger ahead and takes precautions; the simpleton goes blindly on and suffers the consequences.4True humility and fear of the LORD lead to riches, honor, and long life.5The deceitful walk a thorny, treacherous road; whoever values life will stay away.6Teach your children to choose the right path, and when they are older, they will remain upon it.7Just as the rich rule the poor, so the borrower is servant to the lender.8Those who plant seeds of injustice will harvest disaster, and their reign of terror will end.9Blessed are those who are generous, because they feed the poor.10Throw out the mocker, and fighting, quarrels, and insults will disappear.11Anyone who loves a pure heart and gracious speech is the king's friend.12The LORD preserves knowledge, but he ruins the plans of the deceitful.13The lazy person is full of excuses, saying, "If I go outside, I might meet a lion in the street and be killed!"14The mouth of an immoral woman is a deep pit; those living under the LORD's displeasure will fall into it.15A youngster's heart is filled with foolishness, but discipline will drive it away.16A person who gets ahead by oppressing the poor or by showering gifts on the rich will end in poverty.17Listen to the words of the wise; apply your heart to my instruction.  18For it is good to keep these sayings deep within yourself, always ready on your lips.  19I am teaching you today--yes, you--so you will trust in the LORD.  20I have written thirty sayings for you, filled with advice and knowledge.  21In this way, you may know the truth and bring an accurate report to those who sent you.22Do not rob the poor because they are poor or exploit the needy in court.  23For the LORD is their defender. He will injure anyone who injures them.24Keep away from angry, short-tempered people,  25or you will learn to be like them and endanger your soul.26Do not co-sign another person's note or put up a guarantee for someone else's loan.  27If you can't pay it, even your bed will be snatched from under you.28Do not steal your neighbor's property by moving the ancient boundary markers set up by your ancestors.29Do you see any truly competent workers? They will serve kings rather than ordinary people.
