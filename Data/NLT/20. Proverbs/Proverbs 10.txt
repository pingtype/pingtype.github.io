1The proverbs of Solomon: A wise child[a] brings joy to a father; a foolish child brings grief to a mother.2Ill-gotten gain has no lasting value, but right living can save your life.3The LORD will not let the godly starve to death, but he refuses to satisfy the craving of the wicked.4Lazy people are soon poor; hard workers get rich.5A wise youth works hard all summer; a youth who sleeps away the hour of opportunity brings shame.6The godly are showered with blessings; evil people cover up their harmful intentions.7We all have happy memories of the godly, but the name of a wicked person rots away.8The wise are glad to be instructed, but babbling fools fall flat on their faces.9People with integrity have firm footing, but those who follow crooked paths will slip and fall.10People who wink at wrong cause trouble, but a bold reproof promotes peace.[b]11The words of the godly lead to life; evil people cover up their harmful intentions.12Hatred stirs up quarrels, but love covers all offenses.13Wise words come from the lips of people with understanding, but fools will be punished with a rod.14Wise people treasure knowledge, but the babbling of a fool invites trouble.15The wealth of the rich is their fortress; the poverty of the poor is their calamity.16The earnings of the godly enhance their lives, but evil people squander their money on sin.17People who accept correction are on the pathway to life, but those who ignore it will lead others astray.18To hide hatred is to be a liar; to slander is to be a fool.19Don't talk too much, for it fosters sin. Be sensible and turn off the flow!20The words of the godly are like sterling silver; the heart of a fool is worthless.21The godly give good advice, but fools are destroyed by their lack of common sense.22The blessing of the LORD makes a person rich, and he adds no sorrow with it.23Doing wrong is fun for a fool, while wise conduct is a pleasure to the wise.24The fears of the wicked will all come true; so will the hopes of the godly.25Disaster strikes like a cyclone, whirling the wicked away, but the godly have a lasting foundation.26Lazy people are a pain to their employer. They are like smoke in the eyes or vinegar that sets the teeth on edge.27Fear of the LORD lengthens one's life, but the years of the wicked are cut short.28The hopes of the godly result in happiness, but the expectations of the wicked are all in vain.29The LORD protects the upright but destroys the wicked.30The godly will never be disturbed, but the wicked will be removed from the land.31The godly person gives wise advice, but the tongue that deceives will be cut off.32The godly speak words that are helpful, but the wicked speak only what is corrupt.
