1 We can gather our thoughts, but the LORD gives the right answer.2People may be pure in their own eyes, but the LORD examines their motives.3Commit your work to the LORD, and then your plans will succeed.4The LORD has made everything for his own purposes, even the wicked for punishment.5The LORD despises pride; be assured that the proud will be punished.6Unfailing love and faithfulness cover sin; evil is avoided by fear of the LORD.7When the ways of people please the LORD, he makes even their enemies live at peace with them.8It is better to be poor and godly than rich and dishonest.9We can make our plans, but the LORD determines our steps.10The king speaks with divine wisdom; he must never judge unfairly.11The LORD demands fairness in every business deal; he sets the standard.12A king despises wrongdoing, for his rule depends on his justice.13The king is pleased with righteous lips; he loves those who speak honestly.14The anger of the king is a deadly threat; the wise do what they can to appease it.15When the king smiles, there is life; his favor refreshes like a gentle rain.16How much better to get wisdom than gold, and understanding than silver!17The path of the upright leads away from evil; whoever follows that path is safe.18Pride goes before destruction, and haughtiness before a fall.19It is better to live humbly with the poor than to share plunder with the proud.20Those who listen to instruction will prosper; those who trust the LORD will be happy.21The wise are known for their understanding, and instruction is appreciated if it's well presented.22Discretion is a life-giving fountain to those who possess it, but discipline is wasted on fools.23From a wise mind comes wise speech; the words of the wise are persuasive.24Kind words are like honey--sweet to the soul and healthy for the body.25There is a path before each person that seems right, but it ends in death.26It is good for workers to have an appetite; an empty stomach drives them on.27Scoundrels hunt for scandal; their words are a destructive blaze.28A troublemaker plants seeds of strife; gossip separates the best of friends.29Violent people deceive their companions, leading them down a harmful path.30With narrowed eyes, they plot evil; without a word, they plan their mischief.31Gray hair is a crown of glory; it is gained by living a godly life.32It is better to be patient than powerful; it is better to have self-control than to conquer a city.33We may throw the dice, but the LORD determines how they fall.
