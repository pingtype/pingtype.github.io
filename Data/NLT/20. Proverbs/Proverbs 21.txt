1 The king's heart is like a stream of water directed by the LORD; he turns it wherever he pleases.2People may think they are doing what is right, but the LORD examines the heart.3The LORD is more pleased when we do what is just and right than when we give him sacrifices.4Haughty eyes, a proud heart, and evil actions are all sin.5Good planning and hard work lead to prosperity, but hasty shortcuts lead to poverty.6Wealth created by lying is a vanishing mist and a deadly trap.[a]7Because the wicked refuse to do what is just, their violence boomerangs and destroys them.8The guilty walk a crooked path; the innocent travel a straight road.9It is better to live alone in the corner of an attic than with a contentious wife in a lovely home.10Evil people love to harm others; their neighbors get no mercy from them.11A simpleton can learn only by seeing mockers punished; a wise person learns from instruction.12The Righteous One[b] knows what is going on in the homes of the wicked; he will bring the wicked to disaster.13Those who shut their ears to the cries of the poor will be ignored in their own time of need.14A secret gift calms anger; a secret bribe pacifies fury.15Justice is a joy to the godly, but it causes dismay among evildoers.16The person who strays from common sense will end up in the company of the dead.17Those who love pleasure become poor; wine and luxury are not the way to riches.18Sometimes the wicked are punished to save the godly, and the treacherous for the upright.19It is better to live alone in the desert than with a crabby, complaining wife.20The wise have wealth and luxury, but fools spend whatever they get.21Whoever pursues godliness and unfailing love will find life, godliness, and honor.22The wise conquer the city of the strong and level the fortress in which they trust.23If you keep your mouth shut, you will stay out of trouble.24Mockers are proud and haughty; they act with boundless arrogance.25The desires of lazy people will be their ruin, for their hands refuse to work.  26They are always greedy for more, while the godly love to give!27God loathes the sacrifice of an evil person, especially when it is brought with ulterior motives.28A false witness will be cut off, but an attentive witness will be allowed to speak.29The wicked put up a bold front, but the upright proceed with care.30Human plans, no matter how wise or well advised, cannot stand against the LORD.31The horses are prepared for battle, but the victory belongs to the LORD.
