1These are more proverbs of Solomon, collected by the advisers of King Hezekiah of Judah.2It is God's privilege to conceal things and the king's privilege to discover them.3No one can discover the height of heaven, the depth of the earth, or all that goes on in the king's mind!4Remove the dross from silver, and the sterling will be ready for the silversmith.  5Remove the wicked from the king's court, and his reign will be made secure by justice.6Don't demand an audience with the king or push for a place among the great.  7It is better to wait for an invitation than to be sent to the end of the line, publicly disgraced! Just because you see something,  8don't be in a hurry to go to court. You might go down before your neighbors in shameful defeat.  9So discuss the matter with them privately. Don't tell anyone else,  10or others may accuse you of gossip. Then you will never regain your good reputation.11Timely advice is as lovely as golden apples in a silver basket.12Valid criticism is as treasured by the one who heeds it as jewelry made from finest gold.13Faithful messengers are as refreshing as snow in the heat of summer. They revive the spirit of their employer.14A person who doesn't give a promised gift is like clouds and wind that don't bring rain.15Patience can persuade a prince, and soft speech can crush strong opposition.16Do you like honey? Don't eat too much of it, or it will make you sick!17Don't visit your neighbors too often, or you will wear out your welcome.18Telling lies about others is as harmful as hitting them with an ax, wounding them with a sword, or shooting them with a sharp arrow.19Putting confidence in an unreliable person is like chewing with a toothache or walking on a broken foot.20Singing cheerful songs to a person whose heart is heavy is as bad as stealing someone's jacket in cold weather or rubbing salt in a wound.21If your enemies are hungry, give them food to eat. If they are thirsty, give them water to drink.  22You will heap burning coals on their heads, and the LORD will reward you.23As surely as a wind from the north brings rain, so a gossiping tongue causes anger!24It is better to live alone in the corner of an attic than with a contentious wife in a lovely home.25Good news from far away is like cold water to the thirsty.26If the godly compromise with the wicked, it is like polluting a fountain or muddying a spring.27Just as it is not good to eat too much honey, it is not good for people to think about all the honors they deserve.28A person without self-control is as defenseless as a city with broken-down walls.
