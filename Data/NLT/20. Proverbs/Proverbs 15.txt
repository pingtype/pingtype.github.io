1 A gentle answer turns away wrath, but harsh words stir up anger.2The wise person makes learning a joy; fools spout only foolishness.3The LORD is watching everywhere, keeping his eye on both the evil and the good.4Gentle words bring life and health; a deceitful tongue crushes the spirit.5Only a fool despises a parent's discipline; whoever learns from correction is wise.6There is treasure in the house of the godly, but the earnings of the wicked bring trouble.7Only the wise can give good advice; fools cannot do so.8The LORD hates the sacrifice of the wicked, but he delights in the prayers of the upright.9The LORD despises the way of the wicked, but he loves those who pursue godliness.10Whoever abandons the right path will be severely punished; whoever hates correction will die.11Even the depths of Death and Destruction[a] are known by the LORD. How much more does he know the human heart!12Mockers don't love those who rebuke them, so they stay away from the wise.13A glad heart makes a happy face; a broken heart crushes the spirit.14A wise person is hungry for truth, while the fool feeds on trash.15For the poor, every day brings trouble; for the happy heart, life is a continual feast.16It is better to have little with fear for the LORD than to have great treasure with turmoil.17A bowl of soup with someone you love is better than steak with someone you hate.18A hothead starts fights; a cool-tempered person tries to stop them.19A lazy person has trouble all through life; the path of the upright is easy!20Sensible children bring joy to their father; foolish children despise their mother.21Foolishness brings joy to those who have no sense; a sensible person stays on the right path.22Plans go wrong for lack of advice; many counselors bring success.23Everyone enjoys a fitting reply; it is wonderful to say the right thing at the right time!24The path of the wise leads to life above; they leave the grave[b] behind.25The LORD destroys the house of the proud, but he protects the property of widows.26The LORD despises the thoughts of the wicked, but he delights in pure words.27Dishonest money brings grief to the whole family, but those who hate bribes will live.28The godly think before speaking; the wicked spout evil words.29The LORD is far from the wicked, but he hears the prayers of the righteous.30A cheerful look brings joy to the heart; good news makes for good health.31If you listen to constructive criticism, you will be at home among the wise.32If you reject criticism, you only harm yourself; but if you listen to correction, you grow in understanding.33Fear of the LORD teaches a person to be wise; humility precedes honor.
