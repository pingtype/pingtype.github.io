1 It is better to be poor and honest than to be a fool and dishonest.2Zeal without knowledge is not good; a person who moves too quickly may go the wrong way.3People ruin their lives by their own foolishness and then are angry at the LORD.4Wealth makes many "friends"; poverty drives them away.5A false witness will not go unpunished, nor will a liar escape.6Many beg favors from a prince; everyone is the friend of a person who gives gifts!7If the relatives of the poor despise them, how much more will their friends avoid them. The poor call after them, but they are gone.8To acquire wisdom is to love oneself; people who cherish understanding will prosper.9A false witness will not go unpunished, and a liar will be destroyed.10It isn't right for a fool to live in luxury or for a slave to rule over princes!11People with good sense restrain their anger; they earn esteem by overlooking wrongs.12The king's anger is like a lion's roar, but his favor is like dew on the grass.13A foolish child[a] is a calamity to a father; a nagging wife annoys like a constant dripping.14Parents can provide their sons with an inheritance of houses and wealth, but only the LORD can give an understanding wife.15A lazy person sleeps soundly--and goes hungry.16Keep the commandments and keep your life; despising them leads to death.17If you help the poor, you are lending to the LORD--and he will repay you!18Discipline your children while there is hope. If you don't, you will ruin their lives.19Short-tempered people must pay their own penalty. If you rescue them once, you will have to do it again.20Get all the advice and instruction you can, and be wise the rest of your life.21You can make many plans, but the LORD's purpose will prevail.22Loyalty makes a person attractive. And it is better to be poor than dishonest.23Fear of the LORD gives life, security, and protection from harm.24Some people are so lazy that they won't even lift a finger to feed themselves.25If you punish a mocker, the simpleminded will learn a lesson; if you reprove the wise, they will be all the wiser.26Children who mistreat their father or chase away their mother are a public disgrace and an embarrassment.27If you stop listening to instruction, my child, you have turned your back on knowledge.28A corrupt witness makes a mockery of justice; the mouth of the wicked gulps down evil.29Mockers will be punished, and the backs of fools will be beaten.
