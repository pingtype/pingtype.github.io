1These are the sayings of King Lemuel, an oracle[a] that his mother taught him.2O my son, O son of my womb, O son of my promises,  3do not spend your strength on women, on those who ruin kings.4And it is not for kings, O Lemuel, to guzzle wine. Rulers should not crave liquor.  5For if they drink, they may forget their duties and be unable to give justice to those who are oppressed.  6Liquor is for the dying, and wine for those in deep depression.  7Let them drink to forget their poverty and remember their troubles no more.8Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves; ensure justice for those who are perishing.  9Yes, speak up for the poor and helpless, and see that they get justice.10Who can find a virtuous and capable wife? She is worth more than precious rubies.  11Her husband can trust her, and she will greatly enrich his life.  12She will not hinder him but help him all her life.13She finds wool and flax and busily spins it.  14She is like a merchant's ship; she brings her food from afar.  15She gets up before dawn to prepare breakfast for her household and plan the day's work for her servant girls.  16She goes out to inspect a field and buys it; with her earnings she plants a vineyard.17She is energetic and strong, a hard worker.  18She watches for bargains; her lights burn late into the night.  19Her hands are busy spinning thread, her fingers twisting fiber.20She extends a helping hand to the poor and opens her arms to the needy.21She has no fear of winter for her household because all of them have warm[b] clothes.  22She quilts her own bedspreads. She dresses like royalty in gowns of finest cloth.23Her husband is well known, for he sits in the council meeting with the other civic leaders.24She makes belted linen garments and sashes to sell to the merchants.25She is clothed with strength and dignity, and she laughs with no fear of the future.  26When she speaks, her words are wise, and kindness is the rule when she gives instructions.  27She carefully watches all that goes on in her household and does not have to bear the consequences of laziness.28Her children stand and bless her. Her husband praises her:  29"There are many virtuous and capable women in the world, but you surpass them all!"30Charm is deceptive, and beauty does not last; but a woman who fears the LORD will be greatly praised. 31Reward her for all she has done. Let her deeds publicly declare her praise.
