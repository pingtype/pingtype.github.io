1 A wise child[a] accepts a parent's discipline; a young mocker refuses to listen.2Good people enjoy the positive results of their words, but those who are treacherous crave violence.3Those who control their tongue will have a long life; a quick retort can ruin everything.4Lazy people want much but get little, but those who work hard will prosper and be satisfied.5Those who are godly hate lies; the wicked come to shame and disgrace.6Godliness helps people all through life, while the evil are destroyed by their wickedness.7Some who are poor pretend to be rich; others who are rich pretend to be poor.8The rich can pay a ransom, but the poor won't even get threatened.9The life of the godly is full of light and joy, but the sinner's light is snuffed out.10Pride leads to arguments; those who take advice are wise.11Wealth from get-rich-quick schemes quickly disappears; wealth from hard work grows.12Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but when dreams come true, there is life and joy.13People who despise advice will find themselves in trouble; those who respect it will succeed.14The advice of the wise is like a life-giving fountain; those who accept it avoid the snares of death.15A person with good sense is respected; a treacherous person walks a rocky road.16Wise people think before they act; fools don't and even brag about it!17An unreliable messenger stumbles into trouble, but a reliable messenger brings healing.18If you ignore criticism, you will end in poverty and disgrace; if you accept criticism, you will be honored.19It is pleasant to see dreams come true, but fools will not turn from evil to attain them.20Whoever walks with the wise will become wise; whoever walks with fools will suffer harm.21Trouble chases sinners, while blessings chase the righteous!22Good people leave an inheritance to their grandchildren, but the sinner's wealth passes to the godly.23A poor person's farm may produce much food, but injustice sweeps it all away.24If you refuse to discipline your children, it proves you don't love them; if you love your children, you will be prompt to discipline them.25The godly eat to their hearts' content, but the belly of the wicked goes hungry.
