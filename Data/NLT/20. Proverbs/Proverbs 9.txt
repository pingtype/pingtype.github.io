1 Wisdom has built her spacious house with seven pillars.  2She has prepared a great banquet, mixed the wines, and set the table.  3She has sent her servants to invite everyone to come. She calls out from the heights overlooking the city.  4"Come home with me," she urges the simple. To those without good judgment, she says,  5"Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed.  6Leave your foolish ways behind, and begin to live; learn how to be wise."7Anyone who rebukes a mocker will get a smart retort. Anyone who rebukes the wicked will get hurt.  8So don't bother rebuking mockers; they will only hate you. But the wise, when rebuked, will love you all the more.  9Teach the wise, and they will be wiser. Teach the righteous, and they will learn more.10Fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom. Knowledge of the Holy One results in understanding.11Wisdom will multiply your days and add years to your life.  12If you become wise, you will be the one to benefit. If you scorn wisdom, you will be the one to suffer.13The woman named Folly is loud and brash. She is ignorant and doesn't even know it.  14She sits in her doorway on the heights overlooking the city.  15She calls out to men going by who are minding their own business.  16"Come home with me," she urges the simple. To those without good judgment, she says, 17"Stolen water is refreshing; food eaten in secret tastes the best!"  18But the men don't realize that her former guests are now in the grave.[a]
