It is the LORD who directs our steps.25It is dangerous to make a rash promise to God before counting the cost.26A wise king finds the wicked, lays them out like wheat, then runs the crushing wheel over them.27The LORD's searchlight penetrates the human spirit,[b] exposing every hidden motive.28Unfailing love and faithfulness protect the king; his throne is made secure through love.29The glory of the young is their strength; the gray hair of experience is the splendor of the old.30Physical punishment cleanses away evil;[c] such discipline purifies the heart.
