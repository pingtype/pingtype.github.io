1 A dry crust eaten in peace is better than a great feast with strife.2A wise slave will rule over the master's shameful sons and will share their inheritance.3Fire tests the purity of silver and gold, but the LORD tests the heart.4Wrongdoers listen to wicked talk; liars pay attention to destructive words.5Those who mock the poor insult their Maker; those who rejoice at the misfortune of others will be punished.6Grandchildren are the crowning glory of the aged; parents are the pride of their children.7Eloquent speech is not fitting for a fool; even less are lies fitting for a ruler.8A bribe seems to work like magic for those who give it; they succeed in all they do.9Disregarding another person's faults preserves love; telling about them separates close friends.10A single rebuke does more for a person of understanding than a hundred lashes on the back of a fool.11Evil people seek rebellion, but they will be severely punished.12It is safer to meet a bear robbed of her cubs than to confront a fool caught in folly.13If you repay evil for good, evil will never leave your house.14Beginning a quarrel is like opening a floodgate, so drop the matter before a dispute breaks out.15The LORD despises those who acquit the guilty and condemn the innocent.16It is senseless to pay tuition to educate a fool who has no heart for wisdom.17A friend is always loyal, and a brother is born to help in time of need.18It is poor judgment to co-sign a friend's note, to become responsible for a neighbor's debts.19Anyone who loves to quarrel loves sin; anyone who speaks boastfully[a] invites disaster.20The crooked heart will not prosper; the twisted tongue tumbles into trouble.21It is painful to be the parent of a fool; there is no joy for the father of a rebel.22A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a broken spirit saps a person's strength.23The wicked accept secret bribes to pervert justice.24Sensible people keep their eyes glued on wisdom, but a fool's eyes wander to the ends of the earth.25A foolish child[b] brings grief to a father and bitterness to a mother.26It is wrong to fine the godly for being good or to punish nobles for being honest!27A truly wise person uses few words; a person with understanding is even-tempered.28Even fools are thought to be wise when they keep silent; when they keep their mouths shut, they seem intelligent.
