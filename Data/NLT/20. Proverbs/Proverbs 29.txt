1 Whoever stubbornly refuses to accept criticism will suddenly be broken beyond repair.2When the godly are in authority, the people rejoice. But when the wicked are in power, they groan.3The man who loves wisdom brings joy to his father, but if he hangs around with prostitutes, his wealth is wasted.4A just king gives stability to his nation, but one who demands bribes destroys it.5To flatter people is to lay a trap for their feet.6Evil people are trapped by sin, but the righteous escape, shouting for joy.7The godly know the rights of the poor; the wicked don't care to know.8Mockers can get a whole town agitated, but those who are wise will calm anger.9If a wise person takes a fool to court, there will be ranting and ridicule but no satisfaction.10The bloodthirsty hate the honest, but the upright seek out the honest.11A fool gives full vent to anger, but a wise person quietly holds it back.12If a ruler honors liars, all his advisers will be wicked.13The poor and the oppressor have this in common--the LORD gives light to the eyes of both.14A king who is fair to the poor will have a long reign.15To discipline and reprimand a child produces wisdom, but a mother is disgraced by an undisciplined child.16When the wicked are in authority, sin increases. But the godly will live to see the tyrant's downfall.17Discipline your children, and they will give you happiness and peace of mind.18When people do not accept divine guidance, they run wild. But whoever obeys the law is happy.19For a servant, mere words are not enough--discipline is needed. For the words may be understood, but they are not heeded.20There is more hope for a fool than for someone who speaks without thinking.21A servant who is pampered from childhood will later become a rebel.22A hot-tempered person starts fights and gets into all kinds of sin.23Pride ends in humiliation, while humility brings honor.24If you assist a thief, you are only hurting yourself. You will be punished if you report the crime, but you will be cursed if you don't.25Fearing people is a dangerous trap, but to trust the LORD means safety.26Many seek the ruler's favor, but justice comes from the LORD.27The godly despise the wicked; the wicked despise the godly.
