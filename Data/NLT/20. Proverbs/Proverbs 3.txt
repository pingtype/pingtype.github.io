1My child,[a] never forget the things I have taught you. Store my commands in your heart,  2for they will give you a long and satisfying life.  3Never let loyalty and kindness get away from you! Wear them like a necklace; write them deep within your heart.  4Then you will find favor with both God and people, and you will gain a good reputation.5Trust in the LORD with all your heart; do not depend on your own understanding.  6Seek his will in all you do, and he will direct your paths.7Don't be impressed with your own wisdom. Instead, fear the LORD and turn your back on evil.  8Then you will gain renewed health and vitality.9Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the best part of everything your land produces.  10Then he will fill your barns with grain, and your vats will overflow with the finest wine.11My child, don't ignore it when the LORD disciplines you, and don't be discouraged when he corrects you. 12For the LORD corrects those he loves, just as a father corrects a child[b] in whom he delights.13Happy is the person who finds wisdom and gains understanding.  14For the profit of wisdom is better than silver, and her wages are better than gold.  15Wisdom is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire can compare with her.  16She offers you life in her right hand, and riches and honor in her left.  17She will guide you down delightful paths; all her ways are satisfying.  18Wisdom is a tree of life to those who embrace her; happy are those who hold her tightly.19By wisdom the LORD founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens.  20By his knowledge the deep fountains of the earth burst forth, and the clouds poured down rain.21My child, don't lose sight of good planning and insight. Hang on to them,  22for they fill you with life and bring you honor and respect.  23They keep you safe on your way and keep your feet from stumbling.  24You can lie down without fear and enjoy pleasant dreams.  25You need not be afraid of disaster or the destruction that comes upon the wicked,  26for the LORD is your security. He will keep your foot from being caught in a trap.27Do not withhold good from those who deserve it when it's in your power to help them.  28If you can help your neighbor now, don't say, "Come back tomorrow, and then I'll help you."29Do not plot against your neighbors, for they trust you.  30Don't make accusations against someone who hasn't wronged you.31Do not envy violent people; don't copy their ways.  32Such wicked people are an abomination to the LORD, but he offers his friendship to the godly.33The curse of the LORD is on the house of the wicked, but his blessing is on the home of the upright.34The LORD mocks at mockers, but he shows favor to the humble.35The wise inherit honor, but fools are put to shame!
