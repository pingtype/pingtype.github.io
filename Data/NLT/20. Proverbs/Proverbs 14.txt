1 A wise woman builds her house; a foolish woman tears hers down with her own hands.2Those who follow the right path fear the LORD; those who take the wrong path despise him.3The talk of fools is a rod for their backs,[a] but the words of the wise keep them out of trouble.4An empty stable stays clean, but no income comes from an empty stable.5A truthful witness does not lie; a false witness breathes lies.6A mocker seeks wisdom and never finds it, but knowledge comes easily to those with understanding.7Stay away from fools, for you won't find knowledge there.8The wise look ahead to see what is coming, but fools deceive themselves.9Fools make fun of guilt, but the godly acknowledge it and seek reconciliation.10Each heart knows its own bitterness, and no one else can fully share its joy.11The house of the wicked will perish, but the tent of the godly will flourish.12There is a path before each person that seems right, but it ends in death.13Laughter can conceal a heavy heart; when the laughter ends, the grief remains.14Backsliders get what they deserve; good people receive their reward.15Only simpletons believe everything they are told! The prudent carefully consider their steps.16The wise are cautious[b] and avoid danger; fools plunge ahead with great confidence.17Those who are short-tempered do foolish things, and schemers are hated.18The simpleton is clothed with folly, but the wise person is crowned with knowledge.19Evil people will bow before good people; the wicked will bow at the gates of the godly.20The poor are despised even by their neighbors, while the rich have many "friends."21It is sin to despise one's neighbors; blessed are those who help the poor.22If you plot evil, you will be lost; but if you plan good, you will be granted unfailing love and faithfulness.23Work brings profit, but mere talk leads to poverty!24Wealth is a crown for the wise; the effort of fools yields only folly.25A truthful witness saves lives, but a false witness is a traitor.26Those who fear the LORD are secure; he will be a place of refuge for their children.27Fear of the LORD is a life-giving fountain; it offers escape from the snares of death.28A growing population is a king's glory; a dwindling nation is his doom.29Those who control their anger have great understanding; those with a hasty temper will make mistakes.30A relaxed attitude lengthens life; jealousy rots it away.31Those who oppress the poor insult their Maker, but those who help the poor honor him.32The wicked are crushed by their sins, but the godly have a refuge when they die.33Wisdom is enshrined in an understanding heart; wisdom is not[c] found among fools.34Godliness exalts a nation, but sin is a disgrace to any people.35A king rejoices in servants who know what they are doing; he is angry with those who cause trouble.
