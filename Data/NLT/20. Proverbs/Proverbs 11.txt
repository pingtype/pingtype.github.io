1 The LORD hates cheating, but he delights in honesty.2Pride leads to disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom.3Good people are guided by their honesty; treacherous people are destroyed by their dishonesty.4Riches won't help on the day of judgment, but right living is a safeguard against death.5The godly are directed by their honesty; the wicked fall beneath their load of sin.6The godliness of good people rescues them; the ambition of treacherous people traps them.7When the wicked die, their hopes all perish, for they rely on their own feeble strength.8God rescues the godly from danger, but he lets the wicked fall into trouble.9Evil words destroy one's friends; wise discernment rescues the godly.10The whole city celebrates when the godly succeed; they shout for joy when the godless die.11Upright citizens bless a city and make it prosper, but the talk of the wicked tears it apart.12It is foolish to belittle a neighbor; a person with good sense remains silent.13A gossip goes around revealing secrets, but those who are trustworthy can keep a confidence.14Without wise leadership, a nation falls; with many counselors, there is safety.15Guaranteeing a loan for a stranger is dangerous; it is better to refuse than to suffer later.16Beautiful women obtain wealth, and violent men get rich.17Your own soul is nourished when you are kind, but you destroy yourself when you are cruel.18Evil people get rich for the moment, but the reward of the godly will last.19Godly people find life; evil people find death.20The LORD hates people with twisted hearts, but he delights in those who have integrity.21You can be sure that evil people will be punished, but the children of the godly will go free.22A woman who is beautiful but lacks discretion is like a gold ring in a pig's snout.23The godly can look forward to happiness, while the wicked can expect only wrath.24It is possible to give freely and become more wealthy, but those who are stingy will lose everything.25The generous prosper and are satisfied; those who refresh others will themselves be refreshed.26People curse those who hold their grain for higher prices, but they bless the one who sells to them in their time of need.27If you search for good, you will find favor; but if you search for evil, it will find you!28Trust in your money and down you go! But the godly flourish like leaves in spring.29Those who bring trouble on their families inherit only the wind. The fool will be a servant to the wise.30The godly are like trees that bear life-giving fruit, and those who save lives are wise.31If the righteous are rewarded here on earth, how much more true that the wicked and the sinner will get what they deserve!
