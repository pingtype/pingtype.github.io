1My child,[a] listen to me and treasure my instructions.  2Tune your ears to wisdom, and concentrate on understanding.  3Cry out for insight and understanding.  4Search for them as you would for lost money or hidden treasure.  5Then you will understand what it means to fear the LORD, and you will gain knowledge of God.  6For the LORD grants wisdom! From his mouth come knowledge and understanding.  7He grants a treasure of good sense to the godly. He is their shield, protecting those who walk with integrity.  8He guards the paths of justice and protects those who are faithful to him.9Then you will understand what is right, just, and fair, and you will know how to find the right course of action every time.  10For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will fill you with joy.  11Wise planning will watch over you. Understanding will keep you safe.12Wisdom will save you from evil people, from those whose speech is corrupt.  13These people turn from right ways to walk down dark and evil paths.  14They rejoice in doing wrong, and they enjoy evil as it turns things upside down.  15What they do is crooked, and their ways are wrong.16Wisdom will save you from the immoral woman, from the flattery of the adulterous woman.  17She has abandoned her husband and ignores the covenant she made before God.  18Entering her house leads to death; it is the road to hell.[b]  19The man who visits her is doomed. He will never reach the paths of life.20Follow the steps of good men instead, and stay on the paths of the righteous.  21For only the upright will live in the land, and those who have integrity will remain in it.  22But the wicked will be removed from the land, and the treacherous will be destroyed.
