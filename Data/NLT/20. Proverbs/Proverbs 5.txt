1My son, pay attention to my wisdom; listen carefully to my wise counsel.  2Then you will learn to be discreet and will store up knowledge.3The lips of an immoral woman are as sweet as honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil.  4But the result is as bitter as poison, sharp as a double-edged sword.  5Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave.[a]  6For she does not care about the path to life. She staggers down a crooked trail and doesn't even realize where it leads.7So now, my sons, listen to me. Never stray from what I am about to say:  8Run from her! Don't go near the door of her house!  9If you do, you will lose your honor and hand over to merciless people everything you have achieved in life.  10Strangers will obtain your wealth, and someone else will enjoy the fruit of your labor. 11Afterward you will groan in anguish when disease consumes your body,  12and you will say, "How I hated discipline! If only I had not demanded my own way!  13Oh, why didn't I listen to my teachers? Why didn't I pay attention to those who gave me instruction?  14I have come to the brink of utter ruin, and now I must face public disgrace."15Drink water from your own well--share your love only with your wife.[b]  16Why spill the water of your springs in public, having sex with just anyone?[c]  17You should reserve it for yourselves. Don't share it with strangers.18Let your wife be a fountain of blessing for you. Rejoice in the wife of your youth.  19She is a loving doe, a graceful deer. Let her breasts satisfy you always. May you always be captivated by her love.  20Why be captivated, my son, with an immoral woman, or embrace the breasts of an adulterous woman?21For the LORD sees clearly what a man does, examining every path he takes.  22An evil man is held captive by his own sins; they are ropes that catch and hold him.  23He will die for lack of self-control; he will be lost because of his incredible folly.
