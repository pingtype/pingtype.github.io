1Even the wilderness will rejoice in those days. The desert will blossom with flowers.  2Yes, there will be an abundance of flowers and singing and joy! The deserts will become as green as the mountains of Lebanon, as lovely as Mount Carmel's pastures and the plain of Sharon. There the LORD will display his glory, the splendor of our God.3With this news, strengthen those who have tired hands, and encourage those who have weak knees. 4Say to those who are afraid, "Be strong, and do not fear, for your God is coming to destroy your enemies. He is coming to save you."  5And when he comes, he will open the eyes of the blind and unstop the ears of the deaf.  6The lame will leap like a deer, and those who cannot speak will shout and sing! Springs will gush forth in the wilderness, and streams will water the desert.  7The parched ground will become a pool, and springs of water will satisfy the thirsty land. Marsh grass and reeds and rushes will flourish where desert jackals once lived.8And a main road will go through that once deserted land. It will be named the Highway of Holiness. Evil-hearted people will never travel on it. It will be only for those who walk in God's ways; fools will never walk there.  9Lions will not lurk along its course, and there will be no other dangers. Only the redeemed will follow it.  10Those who have been ransomed by the LORD will return to Jerusalem,[a] singing songs of everlasting joy. Sorrow and mourning will disappear, and they will be overcome with joy and gladness.
