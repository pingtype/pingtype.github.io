[The Futility of Relying on Egypt] 1 What sorrow awaits those who look to Egypt for help, trusting their horses, chariots, and charioteers and depending on the strength of human armies instead of looking to the Lord , the Holy One of Israel.2 In his wisdom, the Lord  will send great disaster; he will not change his mind. He will rise against the wicked and against their helpers.3 For these Egyptians are mere humans, not God! Their horses are puny flesh, not mighty spirits! When the Lord  raises his fist against them, those who help will stumble, and those being helped will fall. They will all fall down and die together.4 But this is what the Lord  has told me: "When a strong young lion stands growling over a sheep it has killed, it is not frightened by the shouts and noise of a whole crowd of shepherds. In the same way, the Lord  of Heaven's Armies will come down and fight on Mount Zion.5 The Lord  of Heaven's Armies will hover over Jerusalem and protect it like a bird protecting its nest. He will defend and save the city; he will pass over it and rescue it."6 Though you are such wicked rebels, my people, come and return to the Lord . 7 I know the glorious day will come when each of you will throw away the gold idols and silver images your sinful hands have made.8 "The Assyrians will be destroyed, but not by the swords of men. The sword of God will strike them, and they will panic and flee. The strong young Assyrians will be taken away as captives.9 Even the strongest will quake with terror, and princes will flee when they see your battle flags," says the Lord , whose fire burns in Zion, whose flame blazes from Jerusalem.
