1"Destruction is certain for my rebellious children," says the LORD. "You make plans that are contrary to my will. You weave a web of plans that are not from my Spirit, thus piling up your sins.  2For without consulting me, you have gone down to Egypt to find help. You have put your trust in Pharaoh for his protection.  3But in trusting Pharaoh, you will be humiliated and disgraced.  4For though his power extends to Zoan and Hanes,  5it will all turn out to your shame. He will not help you even one little bit."6Look at the animals moving slowly across the terrible desert to Egypt--donkeys and camels loaded with treasure to pay for Egypt's aid. On through the wilderness they go, where lions and poisonous snakes live. All this, and Egypt will give you nothing in return.  7Egypt's promises are worthless! I call her the Harmless Dragon.[a]8Now go and write down these words concerning Egypt. They will then stand until the end of time as a witness to Israel's unbelief.  9For these people are stubborn rebels who refuse to pay any attention to the LORD's instructions.10They tell the prophets, "Shut up! We don't want any more of your reports." They say, "Don't tell us the truth. Tell us nice things. Tell us lies.  11Forget all this gloom. We have heard more than enough about your `Holy One of Israel.' We are tired of listening to what he has to say."12This is the reply of the Holy One of Israel: "Because you despise what I tell you and trust instead in oppression and lies,  13calamity will come upon you suddenly. It will be like a bulging wall that bursts and falls. In an instant it will collapse and come crashing down.  14You will be smashed like a piece of pottery--shattered so completely that there won't be a piece left that is big enough to carry coals from a fireplace or a little water from the well."15The Sovereign LORD, the Holy One of Israel, says, "Only in returning to me and waiting for me will you be saved. In quietness and confidence is your strength. But you would have none of it.  16You said, `No, we will get our help from Egypt. They will give us swift horses for riding into battle.' But the only swiftness you are going to see is the swiftness of your enemies chasing you!  17One of them will chase a thousand of you. Five of them will make all of you flee. You will be left like a lonely flagpole on a distant mountaintop."18But the LORD still waits for you to come to him so he can show you his love and compassion. For the LORD is a faithful God. Blessed are those who wait for him to help them.19O people of Zion, who live in Jerusalem, you will weep no more. He will be gracious if you ask for help. He will respond instantly to the sound of your cries.  20Though the Lord gave you adversity for food and affliction for drink, he will still be with you to teach you. You will see your teacher with your own eyes,  21and you will hear a voice say, "This is the way; turn around and walk here."  22Then you will destroy all your silver idols and gold images. You will throw them out like filthy rags. "Ugh!" you will say to them. "Begone!"23Then the LORD will bless you with rain at planting time. There will be wonderful harvests and plenty of pastureland for your cattle.  24The oxen and donkeys that till the ground will eat good grain, its chaff having been blown away by the wind.  25In that day, when your enemies are slaughtered, there will be streams of water flowing down every mountain and hill.  26The moon will be as bright as the sun, and the sun will be seven times brighter--like the light of seven days! So it will be when the LORD begins to heal his people and cure the wounds he gave them.27Look! The LORD is coming from far away, burning with anger, surrounded by a thick, rising smoke. His lips are filled with fury; his words consume like fire.  28His anger pours out like a flood on his enemies, sweeping them all away. He will sift out the proud nations. He will bridle them and lead them off to their destruction.29But the people of God will sing a song of joy, like the songs at the holy festivals. You will be filled with joy, as when a flutist leads a group of pilgrims to Jerusalem--the mountain of the LORD--to the Rock of Israel.  30And the LORD will make his majestic voice heard. With angry indignation he will bring down his mighty arm on his enemies. It will descend with devouring flames, with cloudbursts, thunderstorms, and huge hailstones, bringing their destruction.  31At the LORD's command, the Assyrians will be shattered. He will strike them down with his rod.  32And as the LORD strikes them, his people will keep time with the music of tambourines and harps.  33Topheth--the place of burning--has long been ready for the Assyrian king; it has been piled high with wood. The breath of the LORD, like fire from a volcano, will set it ablaze.
