1"Shout with the voice of a trumpet blast. Tell my people Israel[a] of their sins!  2Yet they act so pious! They come to the Temple every day and seem delighted to hear my laws. You would almost think this was a righteous nation that would never abandon its God. They love to make a show of coming to me and asking me to take action on their behalf.  3`We have fasted before you!' they say. `Why aren't you impressed? We have done much penance, and you don't even notice it!'Ê"I will tell you why! It's because you are living for yourselves even while you are fasting. You keep right on oppressing your workers.  4What good is fasting when you keep on fighting and quarreling? This kind of fasting will never get you anywhere with me.  5You humble yourselves by going through the motions of penance, bowing your heads like a blade of grass in the wind. You dress in sackcloth and cover yourselves with ashes. Is this what you call fasting? Do you really think this will please the LORD?6"No, the kind of fasting I want calls you to free those who are wrongly imprisoned and to stop oppressing those who work for you. Treat them fairly and give them what they earn.  7I want you to share your food with the hungry and to welcome poor wanderers into your homes. Give clothes to those who need them, and do not hide from relatives who need your help.8"If you do these things, your salvation will come like the dawn. Yes, your healing will come quickly. Your godliness will lead you forward, and the glory of the LORD will protect you from behind.  9Then when you call, the LORD will answer. `Yes, I am here,' he will quickly reply.Ê"Stop oppressing the helpless and stop making false accusations and spreading vicious rumors!  10Feed the hungry and help those in trouble. Then your light will shine out from the darkness, and the darkness around you will be as bright as day.  11The LORD will guide you continually, watering your life when you are dry and keeping you healthy, too. You will be like a well-watered garden, like an ever-flowing spring.  12Your children will rebuild the deserted ruins of your cities. Then you will be known as the people who rebuild their walls and cities.13"Keep the Sabbath day holy. Don't pursue your own interests on that day, but enjoy the Sabbath and speak of it with delight as the LORD's holy day. Honor the LORD in everything you do, and don't follow your own desires or talk idly. If you do this,  14the LORD will be your delight. I will give you great honor and give you your full share of the inheritance I promised to Jacob, your ancestor. I, the LORD, have spoken!"
