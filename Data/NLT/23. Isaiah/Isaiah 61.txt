1The Spirit of the Sovereign LORD is upon me, because the LORD has appointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to comfort the brokenhearted and to announce that captives will be released and prisoners will be freed.[a]  2He has sent me to tell those who mourn that the time of the LORD's favor has come,[b] and with it, the day of God's anger against their enemies.  3To all who mourn in Israel,[c] he will give beauty for ashes, joy instead of mourning, praise instead of despair. For the LORD has planted them like strong and graceful oaks for his own glory.4They will rebuild the ancient ruins, repairing cities long ago destroyed. They will revive them, though they have been empty for many generations.  5Foreigners will be your servants. They will feed your flocks and plow your fields and tend your vineyards.  6You will be called priests of the LORD, ministers of our God. You will be fed with the treasures of the nations and will boast in their riches.  7Instead of shame and dishonor, you will inherit a double portion of prosperity and everlasting joy.8"For I, the LORD, love justice. I hate robbery and wrongdoing. I will faithfully reward my people for their suffering and make an everlasting covenant with them.  9Their descendants will be known and honored among the nations. Everyone will realize that they are a people the LORD has blessed."10I am overwhelmed with joy in the LORD my God! For he has dressed me with the clothing of salvation and draped me in a robe of righteousness. I am like a bridegroom in his wedding suit or a bride with her jewels.  11The Sovereign LORD will show his justice to the nations of the world. Everyone will praise him! His righteousness will be like a garden in early spring, filled with young plants springing up everywhere.
