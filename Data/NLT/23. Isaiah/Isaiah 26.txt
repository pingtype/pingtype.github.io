1In that day, everyone in the land of Judah will sing this song: Our city is now strong! We are surrounded by the walls of God's salvation.2 Open the gates to all who are righteous; allow the faithful to enter.3 You will keep in perfect peace all who trust in you, whose thoughts are fixed on you!4 Trust in the LORD always, for the LORD GOD is the eternal Rock.5 He humbles the proud and brings the arrogant city to the dust. Its walls come crashing down!6 The poor and oppressed trample it underfoot.7 But for those who are righteous, the path is not steep and rough. You are a God of justice, and you smooth out the road ahead of them.8 LORD, we love to obey your laws; our heart's desire is to glorify your name.9 All night long I search for you; earnestly I seek for God. For only when you come to judge the earth will people turn from wickedness and do what is right.10 Your kindness to the wicked does not make them do good. They keep doing wrong and take no notice of the LORD's majesty.11 O LORD, they do not listen when you threaten. They do not see your upraised fist. Show them your eagerness to defend your people. Perhaps then they will be ashamed. Let your fire consume your enemies.12 LORD, you will grant us peace, for all we have accomplished is really from you.13 O LORD our God, others have ruled us, but we worship you alone.14 Those we served before are dead and gone. Never again will they return! You attacked them and destroyed them, and they are long forgotten.15 We praise you, LORD! You have made our nation great; you have extended our borders!16 LORD, in distress we searched for you. We were bowed beneath the burden of your discipline.17 We were like a woman about to give birth, writhing and crying out in pain. When we are in your presence, LORD,18 we, too, writhe in agony, but nothing comes of our suffering. We have done nothing to rescue the world; no one has been born to populate the earth.19 Yet we have this assurance: Those who belong to God will live; their bodies will rise again! Those who sleep in the earth will rise up and sing for joy! For God's light of life will fall like dew on his people in the place of the dead!20Go home, my people, and lock your doors! Hide until the LORD's anger against your enemies has passed. 21Look! The LORD is coming from heaven to punish the people of the earth for their sins. The earth will no longer hide those who have been murdered. They will be brought out for all to see.
