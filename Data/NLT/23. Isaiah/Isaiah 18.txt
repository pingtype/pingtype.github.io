[A Message about Ethiopia] 1 Listen, Ethiopia[a]-land of fluttering sails[b]that lies at the headwaters of the Nile,2 that sends ambassadors in swift boats down the river. Go, swift messengers! Take a message to a tall, smooth-skinned people, who are feared far and wide for their conquests and destruction, and whose land is divided by rivers.3 All you people of the world, everyone who lives on the earth- when I raise my battle flag on the mountain, look! When I blow the ram's horn, listen!4 For the Lord  has told me this: "I will watch quietly from my dwelling place- as quietly as the heat rises on a summer day, or as the morning dew forms during the harvest."5 Even before you begin your attack, while your plans are ripening like grapes, the Lord  will cut off your new growth with pruning shears. He will snip off and discard your spreading branches.6 Your mighty army will be left dead in the fields for the mountain vultures and wild animals. The vultures will tear at the corpses all summer. The wild animals will gnaw at the bones all winter.7 At that time the Lord  of Heaven's Armies will receive gifts from this land divided by rivers, from this tall, smooth-skinned people, who are feared far and wide for their conquests and destruction. They will bring the gifts to Jerusalem,[c]where the Lord  of Heaven's Armies dwells.       Footnotes:a.   18:1a Hebrew Cush.  b.   18:1b Or land of many locusts; Hebrew reads land of whirring wings.  c.   18:7 Hebrew to Mount Zion.
