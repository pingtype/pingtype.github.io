1"Is anyone thirsty? Come and drink--even if you have no money! Come, take your choice of wine or milk--it's all free!  2Why spend your money on food that does not give you strength? Why pay for food that does you no good? Listen, and I will tell you where to get food that is good for the soul!3"Come to me with your ears wide open. Listen, for the life of your soul is at stake. I am ready to make an everlasting covenant with you. I will give you all the mercies and unfailing love that I promised to David. 4He displayed my power by being my witness and a leader among the nations.  5You also will command the nations, and they will come running to obey, because I, the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, have made you glorious."6Seek the LORD while you can find him. Call on him now while he is near.  7Let the people turn from their wicked deeds. Let them banish from their minds the very thought of doing wrong! Let them turn to the LORD that he may have mercy on them. Yes, turn to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.8"My thoughts are completely different from yours," says the LORD. "And my ways are far beyond anything you could imagine.  9For just as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts higher than your thoughts.10"The rain and snow come down from the heavens and stay on the ground to water the earth. They cause the grain to grow, producing seed for the farmer and bread for the hungry.  11It is the same with my word. I send it out, and it always produces fruit. It will accomplish all I want it to, and it will prosper everywhere I send it.  12You will live in joy and peace. The mountains and hills will burst into song, and the trees of the field will clap their hands!  13Where once there were thorns, cypress trees will grow. Where briers grew, myrtles will sprout up. This miracle will bring great honor to the LORD's name; it will be an everlasting sign of his power and love.
