1Soon after this, Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent Hezekiah his best wishes and a gift. He had heard that Hezekiah had been very sick and that he had recovered.  2Hezekiah welcomed the Babylonian envoys and showed them everything in his treasure-houses--the silver, the gold, the spices, and the aromatic oils. He also took them to see his armory and showed them all his other treasures--everything! There was nothing in his palace or kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.3Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked him, "What did those men want? Where were they from?"ÊHezekiah replied, "They came from the distant land of Babylon."4"What did they see in your palace?" asked Isaiah.Ê"They saw everything," Hezekiah replied. "I showed them everything I own--all my treasures."5Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Listen to this message from the LORD Almighty:  6The time is coming when everything you have--all the treasures stored up by your ancestors--will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the LORD.  7Some of your own descendants will be taken away into exile. They will become eunuchs who will serve in the palace of Babylon's king."8Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "This message you have given me from the LORD is good." But the king was thinking, "At least there will be peace and security during my lifetime."
