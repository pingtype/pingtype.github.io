[Envoys from Babylon] 1 Soon after this, Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent Hezekiah his best wishes and a gift. He had heard that Hezekiah had been very sick and that he had recovered. 2 Hezekiah was delighted with the Babylonian envoys and showed them everything in his treasure-houses-the silver, the gold, the spices, and the aromatic oils. He also took them to see his armory and showed them everything in his royal treasuries! There was nothing in his palace or kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.3 Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked him, "What did those men want? Where were they from?" Hezekiah replied, "They came from the distant land of Babylon."4 "What did they see in your palace?" asked Isaiah. "They saw everything," Hezekiah replied. "I showed them everything I own-all my royal treasuries."5 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Listen to this message from the Lord  of Heaven's Armies: 6 "The time is coming when everything in your palace-all the treasures stored up by your ancestors until now-will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left,' says the Lord . 7 "Some of your very own sons will be taken away into exile. They will become eunuchs who will serve in the palace of Babylon's king.'"8 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "This message you have given me from the Lord  is good." For the king was thinking, "At least there will be peace and security during my lifetime."       Footnotes:
