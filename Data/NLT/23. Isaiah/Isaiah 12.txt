1In that day you will sing: "Praise the LORD! He was angry with me, but now he comforts me.2 See, God has come to save me. I will trust in him and not be afraid. The LORD GOD is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation."3With joy you will drink deeply from the fountain of salvation!  4In that wonderful day you will sing: "Thank the LORD! Praise his name! Tell the world what he has done. Oh, how mighty he is!5 Sing to the LORD, for he has done wonderful things. Make known his praise around the world.6 Let all the people of Jerusalem[a] shout his praise with joy! For great is the Holy One of Israel who lives among you."
