1Out of the stump of David's family[a] will grow a shoot--yes, a new Branch bearing fruit from the old root. 2And the Spirit of the LORD will rest on him--the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.  3He will delight in obeying the LORD. He will never judge by appearance, false evidence, or hearsay.  4He will defend the poor and the exploited. He will rule against the wicked and destroy them with the breath of his mouth.  5He will be clothed with fairness and truth.6In that day the wolf and the lamb will live together; the leopard and the goat will be at peace. Calves and yearlings will be safe among lions, and a little child will lead them all.  7The cattle will graze among bears. Cubs and calves will lie down together. And lions will eat grass as the livestock do.  8Babies will crawl safely among poisonous snakes. Yes, a little child will put its hand in a nest of deadly snakes and pull it out unharmed.  9Nothing will hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain. And as the waters fill the sea, so the earth will be filled with people who know the LORD.10In that day the heir to David's throne[b] will be a banner of salvation to all the world. The nations will rally to him, for the land where he lives will be a glorious place.  11In that day the Lord will bring back a remnant of his people for the second time, returning them to the land of Israel from Assyria, Lower Egypt, Upper Egypt, Ethiopia,[c] Elam, Babylonia,[d] Hamath, and all the distant coastlands.12He will raise a flag among the nations for Israel to rally around. He will gather the scattered people of Judah from the ends of the earth.  13Then at last the jealousy between Israel[e] and Judah will end. They will not fight against each other anymore.  14They will join forces to swoop down on Philistia to the west. Together they will attack and plunder the nations to the east. They will occupy all the lands of Edom, Moab, and Ammon.15The LORD will make a dry path through the Red Sea.[f] He will wave his hand over the Euphrates River,[g] sending a mighty wind to divide it into seven streams that can easily be crossed.  16He will make a highway from Assyria for the remnant there, just as he did for Israel long ago when they returned from Egypt.
