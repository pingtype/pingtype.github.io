1In the year when King Sargon of Assyria captured the Philistine city of Ashdod,  2the LORD told Isaiah son of Amoz, "Take off all your clothes, including your sandals." Isaiah did as he was told and walked around naked and barefoot.3Then the LORD said, "My servant Isaiah has been walking around naked and barefoot for the last three years. This is a sign--a symbol of the terrible troubles I will bring upon Egypt and Ethiopia.[a]  4For the king of Assyria will take away the Egyptians and Ethiopians[b] as prisoners. He will make them walk naked and barefoot, both young and old, their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.  5How dismayed will be the Philistines, who counted on the power of Ethiopia and boasted of their allies in Egypt!  6They will say, `If this can happen to Egypt, what chance do we have? For we counted on Egypt to protect us from the king of Assyria.' "
