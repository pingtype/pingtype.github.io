1"Sing, O childless woman! Break forth into loud and joyful song, O Jerusalem, even though you never gave birth to a child. For the woman who could bear no children now has more than all the other women," says the LORD.  2"Enlarge your house; build an addition; spread out your home!  3For you will soon be bursting at the seams. Your descendants will take over other nations and live in their cities.4"Fear not; you will no longer live in shame. The shame of your youth and the sorrows of widowhood will be remembered no more,  5for your Creator will be your husband. The LORD Almighty is his name! He is your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, the God of all the earth.  6For the LORD has called you back from your grief--as though you were a young wife abandoned by her husband," says your God.  7"For a brief moment I abandoned you, but with great compassion I will take you back.  8In a moment of anger I turned my face away for a little while. But with everlasting love I will have compassion on you," says the LORD, your Redeemer.9"Just as I swore in the time of Noah that I would never again let a flood cover the earth and destroy its life, so now I swear that I will never again pour out my anger on you.  10For the mountains may depart and the hills disappear, but even then I will remain loyal to you. My covenant of blessing will never be broken," says the LORD, who has mercy on you.11"O storm-battered city, troubled and desolate! I will rebuild you on a foundation of sapphires and make the walls of your houses from precious jewels.  12I will make your towers of sparkling rubies and your gates and walls of shining gems.  13I will teach all your citizens, and their prosperity will be great.  14You will live under a government that is just and fair. Your enemies will stay far away; you will live in peace. Terror will not come near.  15If any nation comes to fight you, it will not be because I sent them to punish you. Your enemies will always be defeated because I am on your side.  16I have created the blacksmith who fans the coals beneath the forge and makes the weapons of destruction. And I have created the armies that destroy. 17But in that coming day, no weapon turned against you will succeed. And everyone who tells lies in court will be brought to justice. These benefits are enjoyed by the servants of the LORD; their vindication will come from me. I, the LORD, have spoken!
