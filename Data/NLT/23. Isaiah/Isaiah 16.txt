1 Moab's refugees at Sela send lambs to Jerusalem[a] as a token of alliance with the king of Judah.  2The women of Moab are left like homeless birds at the shallow crossings of the Arnon River.  3"Help us," they cry. "Defend us against our enemies. Protect us from their relentless attack. Do not betray us.  4Let our outcasts stay among you. Hide them from our enemies until the terror is past."ÊWhen oppression and destruction have ceased and enemy raiders have disappeared,  5then David's throne will be established by love. From that throne a faithful king will reign, one who always does what is just and right.6Is this Moab, the proud land we have heard so much about? Its pride and insolence are all gone now! 7The entire land of Moab weeps. Yes, you people of Moab, mourn for the delicacies of Kir-hareseth.  8Weep for the abandoned farms of Heshbon and the vineyards at Sibmah. The wine from those vineyards used to make the rulers of the nations drunk. Moab was once like a spreading grapevine. Her tendrils spread out as far as Jazer and trailed out into the desert. Her shoots once reached as far as the Dead Sea.[b]  9But now the enemy has completely destroyed that vine. So I wail and lament for Jazer and the vineyards of Sibmah. My tears will flow for Heshbon and Elealeh, for their summer fruits and harvests have all been destroyed.10Gone now is the gladness; gone is the joy of harvest. The happy singing in the vineyards will be heard no more. The treading out of grapes in the winepresses has ceased forever. I have ended all their harvest joys.  11I will weep for Moab. My sorrow for Kir-hareseth[c] will be very great.  12On the hilltops the people of Moab will pray in anguish to their idols, but it will do them no good. They will cry to the gods in their temples, but no one will come to save them.13The LORD has already said this about Moab in the past.  14But now the LORD says, "Within three years, without fail, the glory of Moab will be ended, and few of its people will be left alive."
