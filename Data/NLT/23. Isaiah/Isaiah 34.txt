1Come here and listen, O nations of the earth. Let the world and everything in it hear my words.  2For the LORD is enraged against the nations. His fury is against all their armies. He will completely destroy[a] them, bringing about their slaughter.  3Their dead will be left unburied, and the stench of rotting bodies will fill the land. The mountains will flow with their blood.  4The heavens above will melt away and disappear like a rolled-up scroll. The stars will fall from the sky, just as withered leaves and fruit fall from a tree.5And when my sword has finished its work in the heavens, then watch. It will fall upon Edom, the nation I have completely destroyed.  6The sword of the LORD is drenched with blood. It is covered with fat as though it had been used for killing lambs and goats and rams for a sacrifice. Yes, the LORD will offer a great sacrifice in the rich city of Bozrah. He will make a mighty slaughter in Edom.  7The strongest will die--veterans and young men, too. The land will be soaked with blood and the soil enriched with fat.  8For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, the year when Edom will be paid back for all it did to Israel.[b]  9The streams of Edom will be filled with burning pitch, and the ground will be covered with fire.10This judgment on Edom will never end; the smoke of its burning will rise forever. The land will lie deserted from generation to generation. No one will live there anymore.  11It will be haunted by the horned owl, the hawk, the screech owl, and the raven.[c] For God will bring chaos and destruction to that land.  12It will be called the Land of Nothing, and its princes soon will all be gone.  13Thorns will overrun its palaces; nettles will grow in its forts. The ruins will become a haunt for jackals and a home for ostriches.  14Wild animals of the desert will mingle there with hyenas, their howls filling the night. Wild goats will bleat at one another among the ruins, and night creatures will come there to rest.  15There the owl will make her nest and lay her eggs. She will hatch her young and cover them with her wings. And the vultures will come, each one with its mate.16Search the book of the LORD, and see what he will do. He will not miss a single detail. Not one of these birds and animals will be missing, and none will lack a mate, for the LORD has promised this. His Spirit will make it all come true.  17He has surveyed and divided the land and deeded it over to those creatures. They will possess it forever, from generation to generation.
