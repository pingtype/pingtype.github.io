[Babylon's False Gods] 1 Bel and Nebo, the gods of Babylon, bow as they are lowered to the ground. They are being hauled away on ox carts. The poor beasts stagger under the weight.2 Both the idols and their owners are bowed down. The gods cannot protect the people, and the people cannot protect the gods. They go off into captivity together.3 "Listen to me, descendants of Jacob, all you who remain in Israel. I have cared for you since you were born. Yes, I carried you before you were born.4 I will be your God throughout your lifetime- until your hair is white with age. I made you, and I will care for you. I will carry you along and save you.5 "To whom will you compare me? Who is my equal?6 Some people pour out their silver and gold and hire a craftsman to make a god from it. Then they bow down and worship it!7 They carry it around on their shoulders, and when they set it down, it stays there. It can't even move! And when someone prays to it, there is no answer. It can't rescue anyone from trouble.8 "Do not forget this! Keep it in mind! Remember this, you guilty ones.9 Remember the things I have done in the past. For I alone am God! I am God, and there is none like me.10 Only I can tell you the future before it even happens. Everything I plan will come to pass, for I do whatever I wish.11 I will call a swift bird of prey from the east- a leader from a distant land to come and do my bidding. I have said what I would do, and I will do it.12 "Listen to me, you stubborn people who are so far from doing right.13 For I am ready to set things right, not in the distant future, but right now! I am ready to save Jerusalem*and show my glory to Israel.       Footnotes: 46:13 Hebrew Zion.
