For the choir director: A meditation; a psalm* of David. 1 Only fools say in their hearts, "There is no God." They are corrupt, and their actions are evil; not one of them does good!
2 God looks down from heaven on the entire human race; he looks to see if anyone is truly wise, if anyone seeks God.
3 But no, all have turned away; all have become corrupt.*No one does good, not a single one!
4 Will those who do evil never learn? They eat up my people like bread and wouldn't think of praying to God.
5 Terror will grip them, terror like they have never known before. God will scatter the bones of your enemies. You will put them to shame, for God has rejected them.
6 Who will come from Mount Zion to rescue Israel? When God restores his people, Jacob will shout with joy, and Israel will rejoice.
