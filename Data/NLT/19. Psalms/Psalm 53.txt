1  Only fools say in their hearts, "There is no God." They are corrupt, and their actions are evil; no one does good!2 God looks down from heaven on the entire human race; he looks to see if there is even one with real understanding, one who seeks for God.3 But no, all have turned away from God; all have become corrupt. No one does good, not even one!4 Will those who do evil never learn? They eat up my people like bread; they wouldn't think of praying to God.5 But then terror will grip them, terror like they have never known before. God will scatter the bones of your enemies. You will put them to shame, for God has rejected them.6 Oh, that salvation would come from Mount Zion to rescue Israel! For when God restores his people, Jacob will shout with joy, and Israel will rejoice.
