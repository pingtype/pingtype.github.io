A psalm of David, regarding the time David fled from his son Absalom. 1 O Lord , I have so many enemies; so many are against me.
2 So many are saying, "God will never rescue him!" Interlude*But you, O Lord , are a shield around me; you are my glory, the one who holds my head high.
4 I cried out to the Lord , and he answered me from his holy mountain. Interlude
5 I lay down and slept, yet I woke up in safety, for the Lord  was watching over me.
6 I am not afraid of ten thousand enemies who surround me on every side.
7 Arise, O Lord ! Rescue me, my God! Slap all my enemies in the face! Shatter the teeth of the wicked!
8 Victory comes from you, O Lord . May you bless your people. Interlude
