1  Shout with joy to the LORD, O earth!2 Worship the LORD with gladness. Come before him, singing with joy.3 Acknowledge that the LORD is God! He made us, and we are his. We are his people, the sheep of his pasture.4 Enter his gates with thanksgiving; go into his courts with praise. Give thanks to him and bless his name.5 For the LORD is good. His unfailing love continues forever, and his faithfulness continues to each generation.
