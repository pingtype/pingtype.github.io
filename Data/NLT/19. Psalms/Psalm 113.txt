1  Praise the LORD! Yes, give praise, O servants of the LORD. Praise the name of the LORD!2 Blessed be the name of the LORD forever and ever.3 Everywhere--from east to west-- praise the name of the LORD.4 For the LORD is high above the nations; his glory is far greater than the heavens.5 Who can be compared with the LORD our God, who is enthroned on high?6 Far below him are the heavens and the earth. He stoops to look,7 and he lifts the poor from the dirt and the needy from the garbage dump.8 He sets them among princes, even the princes of his own people!9 He gives the barren woman a home, so that she becomes a happy mother. Praise the LORD!
