For the choir director: A song of the descendants of Korah, to be sung by soprano voices.[a]God is our refuge and strength, always ready to help in times of trouble.2 So we will not fear when earthquakes come and the mountains crumble into the sea.3 Let the oceans roar and foam. Let the mountains tremble as the waters surge! Interlude4 A river brings joy to the city of our God, the sacred home of the Most High.5 God dwells in that city; it cannot be destroyed. From the very break of day, God will protect it.6 The nations are in chaos, and their kingdoms crumble! God's voice thunders, and the earth melts!7 The Lord  of Heaven's Armies is here among us; the God of Israel[b] is our fortress. Interlude8 Come, see the glorious works of the Lord : See how he brings destruction upon the world.9 He causes wars to end throughout the earth. He breaks the bow and snaps the spear; he burns the shields with fire.10 "Be still, and know that I am God! I will be honored by every nation. I will be honored throughout the world."11 The Lord  of Heaven's Armies is here among us; the God of Israel is our fortress. Interlude       Footnotes:a.   46:TITLE  Hebrew according to alamoth. 1 b.   46:7 Hebrew of Jacob; also in 46:11. See note on 44:4.
