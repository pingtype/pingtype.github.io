1  I was glad when they said to me, "Let us go to the house of the LORD."2 And now we are standing here inside your gates, O Jerusalem.3 Jerusalem is a well-built city, knit together as a single unit.4 All the people of Israel--the LORD's people-- make their pilgrimage here. They come to give thanks to the name of the LORD as the law requires.5 Here stand the thrones where judgment is given, the thrones of the dynasty of David.6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. May all who love this city prosper.7 O Jerusalem, may there be peace within your walls and prosperity in your palaces.8 For the sake of my family and friends, I will say, "Peace be with you."9 For the sake of the house of the LORD our God, I will seek what is best for you, O Jerusalem.
