1  God is well known in Judah; his name is great in Israel.2 Jerusalem[a] is where he lives; Mount Zion is his home.3 There he breaks the arrows of the enemy, the shields and swords and weapons of his foes.4 You are glorious and more majestic than the everlasting mountains.[b]5 The mightiest of our enemies have been plundered. They lie before us in the sleep of death. No warrior could lift a hand against us.6 When you rebuked them, O God of Jacob, their horses and chariots stood still.7 No wonder you are greatly feared! Who can stand before you when your anger explodes?8 From heaven you sentenced your enemies; the earth trembled and stood silent before you.9 You stand up to judge those who do evil, O God, and to rescue the oppressed of the earth.10 Human opposition only enhances your glory, for you use it as a sword of judgment.[c]11 Make vows to the LORD your God, and fulfill them. Let everyone bring tribute to the Awesome One.12 For he breaks the spirit of princes and is feared by the kings of the earth.
