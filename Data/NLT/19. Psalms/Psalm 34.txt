1  I will praise the LORD at all times. I will constantly speak his praises.2 I will boast only in the LORD; let all who are discouraged take heart.3 Come, let us tell of the LORD's greatness; let us exalt his name together.4 I prayed to the LORD, and he answered me, freeing me from all my fears.5 Those who look to him for help will be radiant with joy; no shadow of shame will darken their faces.6 I cried out to the LORD in my suffering, and he heard me. He set me free from all my fears.7 For the angel of the LORD guards all who fear him, and he rescues them.8 Taste and see that the LORD is good. Oh, the joys of those who trust in him!9 Let the LORD's people show him reverence, for those who honor him will have all they need.10 Even strong young lions sometimes go hungry, but those who trust in the LORD will never lack any good thing.11 Come, my children, and listen to me, and I will teach you to fear the LORD.12 Do any of you want to live a life that is long and good?13 Then watch your tongue! Keep your lips from telling lies!14 Turn away from evil and do good. Work hard at living in peace with others.15 The eyes of the LORD watch over those who do right; his ears are open to their cries for help.16 But the LORD turns his face against those who do evil; he will erase their memory from the earth.17 The LORD hears his people when they call to him for help. He rescues them from all their troubles.18 The LORD is close to the brokenhearted; he rescues those who are crushed in spirit.19 The righteous face many troubles, but the LORD rescues them from each and every one.20 For the LORD protects them from harm-- not one of their bones[a] will be broken!21 Calamity will surely overtake the wicked, and those who hate the righteous will be punished.22 But the LORD will redeem those who serve him. Everyone who trusts in him will be freely pardoned.
