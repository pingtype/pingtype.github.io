1  My heart overflows with a beautiful thought! I will recite a lovely poem to the king, for my tongue is like the pen of a skillful poet.2 You are the most handsome of all. Gracious words stream from your lips. God himself has blessed you forever.3 Put on your sword, O mighty warrior! You are so glorious, so majestic!4 In your majesty, ride out to victory, defending truth, humility, and justice. Go forth to perform awe-inspiring deeds!5 Your arrows are sharp, piercing your enemies' hearts. The nations fall before you, lying down beneath your feet.6 Your throne, O God,[a] endures forever and ever. Your royal power is expressed in justice.7 You love what is right and hate what is wrong. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you, pouring out the oil of joy on you more than on anyone else.8 Your robes are perfumed with myrrh, aloes, and cassia. In palaces decorated with ivory, you are entertained by the music of harps.9 Kings' daughters are among your concubines. At your right side stands the queen, wearing jewelry of finest gold from Ophir!10 Listen to me, O royal daughter; take to heart what I say. Forget your people and your homeland far away.11 For your royal husband delights in your beauty; honor him, for he is your lord.12 The princes of Tyre[b] will shower you with gifts. People of great wealth will entreat your favor.13 The bride, a princess, waits within her chamber, dressed in a gown woven with gold.14 In her beautiful robes, she is led to the king, accompanied by her bridesmaids.15 What a joyful, enthusiastic procession as they enter the king's palace!16 Your sons will become kings like their father. You will make them rulers over many lands.17 I will bring honor to your name in every generation. Therefore, the nations will praise you forever and ever.
