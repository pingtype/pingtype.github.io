1  Oh, the joys of those who are kind to the poor. The LORD rescues them in times of trouble.2 The LORD protects them and keeps them alive. He gives them prosperity and rescues them from their enemies.3 The LORD nurses them when they are sick and eases their pain and discomfort.4 "O LORD," I prayed, "have mercy on me. Heal me, for I have sinned against you."5 But my enemies say nothing but evil about me. "How soon will he die and be forgotten?" they ask.6 They visit me as if they are my friends, but all the while they gather gossip, and when they leave, they spread it everywhere.7 All who hate me whisper about me, imagining the worst for me.8 "Whatever he has, it is fatal," they say. "He will never get out of that bed!"9 Even my best friend, the one I trusted completely, the one who shared my food, has turned against me.10 LORD, have mercy on me. Make me well again, so I can pay them back!11 I know that you are pleased with me, for you have not let my enemy triumph over me.12 You have preserved my life because I am innocent; you have brought me into your presence forever.13 Bless the LORD, the God of Israel, who lives forever from eternal ages past. Amen and amen!
