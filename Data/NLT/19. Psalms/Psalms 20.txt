For the choir director: A psalm of David. 1 In times of trouble, may the Lord  answer your cry. May the name of the God of Jacob keep you safe from all harm.2 May he send you help from his sanctuary and strengthen you from Jerusalem.[a]3 May he remember all your gifts and look favorably on your burnt offerings. Interlude4 May he grant your heart's desires and make all your plans succeed.5 May we shout for joy when we hear of your victory and raise a victory banner in the name of our God. May the Lord  answer all your prayers.6 Now I know that the Lord  rescues his anointed king. He will answer him from his holy heaven and rescue him by his great power.7 Some nations boast of their chariots and horses, but we boast in the name of the Lord  our God.8 Those nations will fall down and collapse, but we will rise up and stand firm.9 Give victory to our king, O Lord ! Answer our cry for help.       Footnotes:a.   20:2 Hebrew Zion.
