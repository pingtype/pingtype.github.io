1  Praise the LORD! Praise the LORD, I tell myself.2 I will praise the LORD as long as I live. I will sing praises to my God even with my dying breath.3 Don't put your confidence in powerful people; there is no help for you there.4 When their breathing stops, they return to the earth, and in a moment all their plans come to an end.5 But happy are those who have the God of Israel[a] as their helper, whose hope is in the LORD their God.6 He is the one who made heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them. He is the one who keeps every promise forever,7 who gives justice to the oppressed and food to the hungry. The LORD frees the prisoners.8 The LORD opens the eyes of the blind. The LORD lifts the burdens of those bent beneath their loads. The LORD loves the righteous.9 The LORD protects the foreigners among us. He cares for the orphans and widows, but he frustrates the plans of the wicked.10 The LORD will reign forever. O Jerusalem,[b] your God is King in every generation! Praise the LORD!
