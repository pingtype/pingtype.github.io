1  The LORD is king! He is robed in majesty. Indeed, the LORD is robed in majesty and armed with strength. The world is firmly established; it cannot be shaken.2 Your throne, O LORD, has been established from time immemorial. You yourself are from the everlasting past.3 The mighty oceans have roared, O LORD. The mighty oceans roar like thunder; the mighty oceans roar as they pound the shore.4 But mightier than the violent raging of the seas, mightier than the breakers on the shore-- the LORD above is mightier than these!5 Your royal decrees cannot be changed. The nature of your reign, O LORD, is holiness forever.
