1  I will praise you, LORD, for you have rescued me. You refused to let my enemies triumph over me.2 O LORD my God, I cried out to you for help, and you restored my health.3 You brought me up from the grave, O LORD. You kept me from falling into the pit of death.4 Sing to the LORD, all you godly ones! Praise his holy name.5 His anger lasts for a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime! Weeping may go on all night, but joy comes with the morning.6 When I was prosperous I said, "Nothing can stop me now!"7 Your favor, O LORD, made me as secure as a mountain. Then you turned away from me, and I was shattered.8 I cried out to you, O LORD. I begged the Lord for mercy, saying,9 "What will you gain if I die, if I sink down into the grave? Can my dust praise you from the grave? Can it tell the world of your faithfulness?10 Hear me, LORD, and have mercy on me. Help me, O LORD."11 You have turned my mourning into joyful dancing. You have taken away my clothes of mourning and clothed me with joy,12 that I might sing praises to you and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give you thanks forever!
