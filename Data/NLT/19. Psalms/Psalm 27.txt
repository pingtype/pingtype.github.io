1  The LORD is my light and my salvation-- so why should I be afraid? The LORD protects me from danger-- so why should I tremble?2 When evil people come to destroy me, when my enemies and foes attack me, they will stumble and fall.3 Though a mighty army surrounds me, my heart will know no fear. Even if they attack me, I remain confident.4 The one thing I ask of the LORD-- the thing I seek most-- is to live in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, delighting in the LORD's perfections and meditating in his Temple.5 For he will conceal me there when troubles come; he will hide me in his sanctuary. He will place me out of reach on a high rock.6 Then I will hold my head high, above my enemies who surround me. At his Tabernacle I will offer sacrifices with shouts of joy, singing and praising the LORD with music.7 Listen to my pleading, O LORD. Be merciful and answer me!8 My heart has heard you say, "Come and talk with me." And my heart responds, "LORD, I am coming."9 Do not hide yourself from me. Do not reject your servant in anger. You have always been my helper. Don't leave me now; don't abandon me, O God of my salvation!10 Even if my father and mother abandon me, the LORD will hold me close.11 Teach me how to live, O LORD. Lead me along the path of honesty, for my enemies are waiting for me to fall.12 Do not let me fall into their hands. For they accuse me of things I've never done and breathe out violence against me.13 Yet I am confident that I will see the LORD's goodness while I am here in the land of the living.14 Wait patiently for the LORD. Be brave and courageous. Yes, wait patiently for the LORD.
