1  I love the LORD because he hears and answers my prayers.2 Because he bends down and listens, I will pray as long as I have breath!3 Death had its hands around my throat; the terrors of the grave[a] overtook me. I saw only trouble and sorrow.4 Then I called on the name of the LORD: "Please, LORD, save me!"5 How kind the LORD is! How good he is! So merciful, this God of ours!6 The LORD protects those of childlike faith; I was facing death, and then he saved me.7 Now I can rest again, for the LORD has been so good to me.8 He has saved me from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling.9 And so I walk in the LORD's presence as I live here on earth!10 I believed in you, so I prayed, "I am deeply troubled, LORD."11 In my anxiety I cried out to you, "These people are all liars!"12 What can I offer the LORD for all he has done for me?13 I will lift up a cup symbolizing his salvation; I will praise the LORD's name for saving me.14 I will keep my promises to the LORD in the presence of all his people.15 The LORD's loved ones are precious to him; it grieves him when they die.16 O LORD, I am your servant; yes, I am your servant, the son of your handmaid, and you have freed me from my bonds!17 I will offer you a sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of the LORD.18 I will keep my promises to the LORD in the presence of all his people,19 in the house of the LORD, in the heart of Jerusalem. Praise the LORD!
