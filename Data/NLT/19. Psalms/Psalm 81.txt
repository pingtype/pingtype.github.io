1[a]  Sing praises to God, our strength. Sing to the God of Israel.[b]2 Sing! Beat the tambourine. Play the sweet lyre and the harp.3 Sound the trumpet for a sacred feast when the moon is new, when the moon is full.4 For this is required by the laws of Israel; it is a law of the God of Jacob.5 He made it a decree for Israel[c] when he attacked Egypt to set us free. I heard an unknown voice that said,6 "Now I will relieve your shoulder of its burden; I will free your hands from their heavy tasks.7 You cried to me in trouble, and I saved you; I answered out of the thundercloud. I tested your faith at Meribah, when you complained that there was no water.8 "Listen to me, O my people, while I give you stern warnings. O Israel, if you would only listen!9 You must never have a foreign god; you must not bow down before a false god.10 For it was I, the LORD your God, who rescued you from the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it with good things.11 "But no, my people wouldn't listen. Israel did not want me around.12 So I let them follow their blind and stubborn way, living according to their own desires.13 But oh, that my people would listen to me! Oh, that Israel would follow me, walking in my paths!14 How quickly I would then subdue their enemies! How soon my hands would be upon their foes!15 Those who hate the LORD would cringe before him; their desolation would last forever.16 But I would feed you with the best of foods. I would satisfy you with wild honey from the rock."
