1  O God, listen to my complaint. Do not let my enemies' threats overwhelm me.2 Protect me from the plots of the wicked, from the scheming of those who do evil.3 Sharp tongues are the swords they wield; bitter words are the arrows they aim.4 They shoot from ambush at the innocent, attacking suddenly and fearlessly.5 They encourage each other to do evil and plan how to set their traps. "Who will ever notice?" they ask.6 As they plot their crimes, they say, "We have devised the perfect plan!" Yes, the human heart and mind are cunning.7 But God himself will shoot them down. Suddenly, his arrows will pierce them.8 Their own words will be turned against them, destroying them. All who see it happening will shake their heads in scorn.9 Then everyone will stand in awe, proclaiming the mighty acts of God, realizing all the amazing things he does.10 The godly will rejoice in the LORD and find shelter in him. And those who do what is right will praise him.
