[Book Two (Psalms 42-72)] For the choir director: A psalm[a] of the descendants of Korah. 1 As the deer longs for streams of water, so I long for you, O God.2 I thirst for God, the living God. When can I go and stand before him?3 Day and night I have only tears for food, while my enemies continually taunt me, saying, "Where is this God of yours?"4 My heart is breaking as I remember how it used to be: I walked among the crowds of worshipers, leading a great procession to the house of God, singing for joy and giving thanks amid the sound of a great celebration!5 Why am I discouraged? Why is my heart so sad? I will put my hope in God! I will praise him again- my Savior and 6 my God!  Now I am deeply discouraged, but I will remember you- even from distant Mount Hermon, the source of the Jordan, from the land of Mount Mizar.7 I hear the tumult of the raging seas as your waves and surging tides sweep over me.8 But each day the Lord  pours his unfailing love upon me, and through each night I sing his songs, praying to God who gives me life.9 "O God my rock," I cry, "Why have you forgotten me? Why must I wander around in grief, oppressed by my enemies?"10 Their taunts break my bones. They scoff, "Where is this God of yours?"11 Why am I discouraged? Why is my heart so sad? I will put my hope in God! I will praise him again- my Savior and my God!       Footnotes:a.   42:TITLE  Hebrew maskil. This may be a literary or musical term.
