For the choir director: A psalm[a] of David, regarding the time the Philistines seized him in Gath. To be sung to the tune "Dove on Distant Oaks." 1 O God, have mercy on me, for people are hounding me. My foes attack me all day long.2 I am constantly hounded by those who slander me, and many are boldly attacking me.3 But when I am afraid, I will put my trust in you.4 I praise God for what he has promised. I trust in God, so why should I be afraid? What can mere mortals do to me?5 They are always twisting what I say; they spend their days plotting to harm me.6 They come together to spy on me- watching my every step, eager to kill me.7 Don't let them get away with their wickedness; in your anger, O God, bring them down.8 You keep track of all my sorrows.[b]You have collected all my tears in your bottle. You have recorded each one in your book.9 My enemies will retreat when I call to you for help. This I know: God is on my side!10 I praise God for what he has promised; yes, I praise the Lord  for what he has promised.11 I trust in God, so why should I be afraid? What can mere mortals do to me?12 I will fulfill my vows to you, O God, and will offer a sacrifice of thanks for your help.13 For you have rescued me from death; you have kept my feet from slipping. So now I can walk in your presence, O God, in your life-giving light.       Footnotes:a.   56:TITLE  Hebrew miktam. This may be a literary or musical term.  b.   56:8 Or my wanderings.
