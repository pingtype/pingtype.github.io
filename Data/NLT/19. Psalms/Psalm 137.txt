1  Beside the rivers of Babylon, we sat and wept as we thought of Jerusalem.[a]2 We put away our lyres, hanging them on the branches of the willow trees.3 For there our captors demanded a song of us. Our tormentors requested a joyful hymn: "Sing us one of those songs of Jerusalem!"4 But how can we sing the songs of the LORD while in a foreign land?5 If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill upon the harp.6 May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I fail to remember you, if I don't make Jerusalem my highest joy.7 O LORD, remember what the Edomites did on the day the armies of Babylon captured Jerusalem. "Destroy it!" they yelled. "Level it to the ground!"8 O Babylon, you will be destroyed. Happy is the one who pays you back for what you have done to us.9 Happy is the one who takes your babies and smashes them against the rocks!
