1  O LORD, I am calling to you. Please hurry! Listen when I cry to you for help!2 Accept my prayer as incense offered to you, and my upraised hands as an evening offering.3 Take control of what I say, O LORD, and keep my lips sealed.4 Don't let me lust for evil things; don't let me participate in acts of wickedness. Don't let me share in the delicacies of those who do evil.5 Let the godly strike me! It will be a kindness! If they reprove me, it is soothing medicine. Don't let me refuse it. But I am in constant prayer against the wicked and their deeds.6 When their leaders are thrown down from a cliff, they will listen to my words and find them pleasing.7 Even as a farmer breaks up the soil and brings up rocks, so the bones of the wicked will be scattered without a decent burial.8 I look to you for help, O Sovereign LORD. You are my refuge; don't let them kill me.9 Keep me out of the traps they have set for me, out of the snares of those who do evil.10 Let the wicked fall into their own snares, but let me escape.
