1  Sin whispers to the wicked, deep within their hearts. They have no fear of God to restrain them.2 In their blind conceit, they cannot see how wicked they really are.3 Everything they say is crooked and deceitful. They refuse to act wisely or do what is good.4 They lie awake at night, hatching sinful plots. Their course of action is never good. They make no attempt to turn from evil.5 Your unfailing love, O LORD, is as vast as the heavens; your faithfulness reaches beyond the clouds.6 Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, your justice like the ocean depths. You care for people and animals alike, O LORD.7 How precious is your unfailing love, O God! All humanity finds shelter in the shadow of your wings.8 You feed them from the abundance of your own house, letting them drink from your rivers of delight.9 For you are the fountain of life, the light by which we see.10 Pour out your unfailing love on those who love you; give justice to those with honest hearts.11 Don't let the proud trample me; don't let the wicked push me around.12 Look! They have fallen! They have been thrown down, never to rise again.
