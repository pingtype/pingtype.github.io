A song for pilgrims ascending to Jerusalem. 1 I look up to the mountains- does my help come from there?2 My help comes from the Lord , who made heaven and earth!3 He will not let you stumble; the one who watches over you will not slumber.4 Indeed, he who watches over Israel never slumbers or sleeps.5 The Lord  himself watches over you! The Lord  stands beside you as your protective shade.6 The sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon at night.7 The Lord  keeps you from all harm and watches over your life.8 The Lord  keeps watch over you as you come and go, both now and forever.
