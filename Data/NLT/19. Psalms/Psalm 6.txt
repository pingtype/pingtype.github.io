1[a]  O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your rage.
2 Have compassion on me, LORD, for I am weak. Heal me, LORD, for my body is in agony.
3 I am sick at heart. How long, O LORD, until you restore me?
4 Return, O LORD, and rescue me. Save me because of your unfailing love.
5 For in death, who remembers you? Who can praise you from the grave?
6 I am worn out from sobbing. Every night tears drench my bed; my pillow is wet from weeping.
7 My vision is blurred by grief; my eyes are worn out because of all my enemies.
8 Go away, all you who do evil, for the LORD has heard my crying.
9 The LORD has heard my plea; the LORD will answer my prayer.
10 May all my enemies be disgraced and terrified. May they suddenly turn back in shame.
