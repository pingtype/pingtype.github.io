For the choir director: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by an eight-stringed instrument.[a]1 Help, O Lord , for the godly are fast disappearing! The faithful have vanished from the earth!2 Neighbors lie to each other, speaking with flattering lips and deceitful hearts.3 May the Lord  cut off their flattering lips and silence their boastful tongues.4 They say, "We will lie to our hearts' content. Our lips are our own-who can stop us?"5 The Lord  replies, "I have seen violence done to the helpless, and I have heard the groans of the poor. Now I will rise up to rescue them, as they have longed for me to do."6 The Lord 's promises are pure, like silver refined in a furnace, purified seven times over.7 Therefore, Lord , we know you will protect the oppressed, preserving them forever from this lying generation,8 even though the wicked strut about, and evil is praised throughout the land.       Footnotes:a.   12:TITLE  Hebrew according to the sheminith.
