1  Praise the LORD! Praise God in his heavenly dwelling; praise him in his mighty heaven!2 Praise him for his mighty works; praise his unequaled greatness!3 Praise him with a blast of the trumpet; praise him with the lyre and harp!4 Praise him with the tambourine and dancing; praise him with stringed instruments and flutes!5 Praise him with a clash of cymbals; praise him with loud clanging cymbals.6Let everything that lives sing praises to the LORD! Praise the LORD!
