A song for pilgrims ascending to Jerusalem. 1 How joyful are those who fear the Lord - all who follow his ways!2 You will enjoy the fruit of your labor. How joyful and prosperous you will be!3 Your wife will be like a fruitful grapevine, flourishing within your home. Your children will be like vigorous young olive trees as they sit around your table.4 That is the Lord 's blessing for those who fear him.5 May the Lord  continually bless you from Zion. May you see Jerusalem prosper as long as you live.6 May you live to enjoy your grandchildren. May Israel have peace!
