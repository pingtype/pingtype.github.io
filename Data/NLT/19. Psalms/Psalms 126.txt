A song for pilgrims ascending to Jerusalem. 1 When the Lord  brought back his exiles to Jerusalem,[a]it was like a dream!2 We were filled with laughter, and we sang for joy. And the other nations said, "What amazing things the Lord  has done for them."3 Yes, the Lord  has done amazing things for us! What joy!4 Restore our fortunes, Lord , as streams renew the desert.5 Those who plant in tears will harvest with shouts of joy.6 They weep as they go to plant their seed, but they sing as they return with the harvest.       Footnotes:a.   126:1 Hebrew Zion.
