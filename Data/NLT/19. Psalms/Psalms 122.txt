A song for pilgrims ascending to Jerusalem. A psalm of David. 1 I was glad when they said to me, "Let us go to the house of the Lord ."2 And now here we are, standing inside your gates, O Jerusalem.3 Jerusalem is a well-built city; its seamless walls cannot be breached.4 All the tribes of Israel-the Lord 's people- make their pilgrimage here. They come to give thanks to the name of the Lord , as the law requires of Israel.5 Here stand the thrones where judgment is given, the thrones of the dynasty of David.6 Pray for peace in Jerusalem. May all who love this city prosper.7 O Jerusalem, may there be peace within your walls and prosperity in your palaces.8 For the sake of my family and friends, I will say, "May you have peace."9 For the sake of the house of the Lord  our God, I will seek what is best for you, O Jerusalem.
