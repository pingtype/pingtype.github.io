For the choir director: A psalm* of David, regarding the time the Ziphites came and said to Saul, "We know where David is hiding." To be accompanied by stringed instruments. 1 Come with great power, O God, and rescue me! Defend me with your might.
2 Listen to my prayer, O God. Pay attention to my plea.
3 For strangers are attacking me; violent people are trying to kill me. They care nothing for God. Interlude
4 But God is my helper. The Lord keeps me alive!
5 May the evil plans of my enemies be turned against them. Do as you promised and put an end to them.
6 I will sacrifice a voluntary offering to you; I will praise your name, O Lord , for it is good.
7 For you have rescued me from my troubles and helped me to triumph over my enemies.
