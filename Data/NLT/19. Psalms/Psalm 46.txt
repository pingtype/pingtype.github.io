1  God is our refuge and strength, always ready to help in times of trouble.2 So we will not fear, even if earthquakes come and the mountains crumble into the sea.3 Let the oceans roar and foam. Let the mountains tremble as the waters surge!4 A river brings joy to the city of our God, the sacred home of the Most High.5 God himself lives in that city; it cannot be destroyed. God will protect it at the break of day.6 The nations are in an uproar, and kingdoms crumble! God thunders, and the earth melts!7 The LORD Almighty is here among us; the God of Israel[b] is our fortress.8 Come, see the glorious works of the LORD: See how he brings destruction upon the world9 and causes wars to end throughout the earth. He breaks the bow and snaps the spear in two; he burns the shields with fire.10 "Be silent, and know that I am God! I will be honored by every nation. I will be honored throughout the world."11 The LORD Almighty is here among us; the God of Israel is our fortress.
