1  From the depths of despair, O LORD, I call for your help.2 Hear my cry, O Lord. Pay attention to my prayer.3 LORD, if you kept a record of our sins, who, O Lord, could ever survive?4 But you offer forgiveness, that we might learn to fear you.5 I am counting on the LORD; yes, I am counting on him. I have put my hope in his word.6 I long for the Lord more than sentries long for the dawn, yes, more than sentries long for the dawn.7 O Israel, hope in the LORD; for with the LORD there is unfailing love and an overflowing supply of salvation.8 He himself will free Israel from every kind of sin.
