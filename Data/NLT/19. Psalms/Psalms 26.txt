A psalm of David. 1 Declare me innocent, O Lord , for I have acted with integrity; I have trusted in the Lord  without wavering.2 Put me on trial, Lord , and cross-examine me. Test my motives and my heart.3 For I am always aware of your unfailing love, and I have lived according to your truth.4 I do not spend time with liars or go along with hypocrites.5 I hate the gatherings of those who do evil, and I refuse to join in with the wicked.6 I wash my hands to declare my innocence. I come to your altar, O Lord ,7 singing a song of thanksgiving and telling of all your wonders.8 I love your sanctuary, Lord , the place where your glorious presence dwells.9 Don't let me suffer the fate of sinners. Don't condemn me along with murderers.10 Their hands are dirty with evil schemes, and they constantly take bribes.11 But I am not like that; I live with integrity. So redeem me and show me mercy.12 Now I stand on solid ground, and I will publicly praise the Lord .
