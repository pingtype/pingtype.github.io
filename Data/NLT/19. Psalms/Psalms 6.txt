For the choir director: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by an eight-stringed instrument.[a] 1 O Lord , don't rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your rage.2 Have compassion on me, Lord , for I am weak. Heal me, Lord , for my bones are in agony.3 I am sick at heart. How long, O Lord , until you restore me?4 Return, O Lord , and rescue me. Save me because of your unfailing love.5 For the dead do not remember you. Who can praise you from the grave?[b]6 I am worn out from sobbing. All night I flood my bed with weeping, drenching it with my tears.7 My vision is blurred by grief; my eyes are worn out because of all my enemies.8 Go away, all you who do evil, for the Lord  has heard my weeping.9 The Lord  has heard my plea; the Lord  will answer my prayer.10 May all my enemies be disgraced and terrified. May they suddenly turn back in shame.       Footnotes:a.   6:TITLE  Hebrew with stringed instruments; according to the sheminith. b.   6:5 Hebrew from Sheol?
