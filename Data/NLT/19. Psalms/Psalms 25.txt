*A psalm of David. 1 O Lord , I give my life to you.
2 I trust in you, my God! Do not let me be disgraced, or let my enemies rejoice in my defeat.
3 No one who trusts in you will ever be disgraced, but disgrace comes to those who try to deceive others.
4 Show me the right path, O Lord ; point out the road for me to follow.
5 Lead me by your truth and teach me, for you are the God who saves me. All day long I put my hope in you.
6 Remember, O Lord , your compassion and unfailing love, which you have shown from long ages past.
7 Do not remember the rebellious sins of my youth. Remember me in the light of your unfailing love, for you are merciful, O Lord .
8 The Lord  is good and does what is right; he shows the proper path to those who go astray.
9 He leads the humble in doing right, teaching them his way.
10 The Lord  leads with unfailing love and faithfulness all who keep his covenant and obey his demands.
11 For the honor of your name, O Lord , forgive my many, many sins.
12 Who are those who fear the Lord ? He will show them the path they should choose.
13 They will live in prosperity, and their children will inherit the land.
14 The Lord  is a friend to those who fear him. He teaches them his covenant.
15 My eyes are always on the Lord , for he rescues me from the traps of my enemies.
16 Turn to me and have mercy, for I am alone and in deep distress.
17 My problems go from bad to worse. Oh, save me from them all!
18 Feel my pain and see my trouble. Forgive all my sins.
19 See how many enemies I have and how viciously they hate me!
20 Protect me! Rescue my life from them! Do not let me be disgraced, for in you I take refuge.
21 May integrity and honesty protect me, for I put my hope in you.
22 O God, ransom Israel from all its troubles.
