For Jeduthun, the choir director: A psalm of David. 1 I said to myself, "I will watch what I do and not sin in what I say. I will hold my tongue when the ungodly are around me."2 But as I stood there in silence- not even speaking of good things- the turmoil within me grew worse.3 The more I thought about it, the hotter I got, igniting a fire of words:4 " Lord , remind me how brief my time on earth will be. Remind me that my days are numbered- how fleeting my life is.5 You have made my life no longer than the width of my hand. My entire lifetime is just a moment to you; at best, each of us is but a breath." Interlude6 We are merely moving shadows, and all our busy rushing ends in nothing. We heap up wealth, not knowing who will spend it.7 And so, Lord, where do I put my hope? My only hope is in you.8 Rescue me from my rebellion. Do not let fools mock me.9 I am silent before you; I won't say a word, for my punishment is from you.10 But please stop striking me! I am exhausted by the blows from your hand.11 When you discipline us for our sins, you consume like a moth what is precious to us. Each of us is but a breath. Interlude12 Hear my prayer, O Lord ! Listen to my cries for help! Don't ignore my tears. For I am your guest- a traveler passing through, as my ancestors were before me.13 Leave me alone so I can smile again before I am gone and exist no more.
