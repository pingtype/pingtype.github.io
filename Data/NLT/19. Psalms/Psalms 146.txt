1 Praise the Lord ! Let all that I am praise the Lord .2 I will praise the Lord  as long as I live. I will sing praises to my God with my dying breath.3 Don't put your confidence in powerful people; there is no help for you there.4 When they breathe their last, they return to the earth, and all their plans die with them.5 But joyful are those who have the God of Israel[a] as their helper, whose hope is in the Lord  their God.6 He made heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them. He keeps every promise forever.7 He gives justice to the oppressed and food to the hungry. The Lord  frees the prisoners.8 The Lord  opens the eyes of the blind. The Lord  lifts up those who are weighed down. The Lord  loves the godly.9 The Lord  protects the foreigners among us. He cares for the orphans and widows, but he frustrates the plans of the wicked.10 The Lord  will reign forever. He will be your God, O Jerusalem,[b] throughout the generations. Praise the Lord !       Footnotes:a.   146:5 Hebrew of Jacob. See note on 44:4.  b.   146:10 Hebrew Zion.
