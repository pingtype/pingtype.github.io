1  Bend down, O LORD, and hear my prayer; answer me, for I need your help.2 Protect me, for I am devoted to you. Save me, for I serve you and trust you. You are my God.3 Be merciful, O Lord, for I am calling on you constantly.4 Give me happiness, O Lord, for my life depends on you.5 O Lord, you are so good, so ready to forgive, so full of unfailing love for all who ask your aid.6 Listen closely to my prayer, O LORD; hear my urgent cry.7 I will call to you whenever trouble strikes, and you will answer me.8 Nowhere among the pagan gods is there a god like you, O Lord. There are no other miracles like yours.9 All the nations--and you made each one-- will come and bow before you, Lord; they will praise your great and holy name.10 For you are great and perform great miracles. You alone are God.11 Teach me your ways, O LORD, that I may live according to your truth! Grant me purity of heart, that I may honor you.12 With all my heart I will praise you, O Lord my God. I will give glory to your name forever,13 for your love for me is very great. You have rescued me from the depths of death[a]!14 O God, insolent people rise up against me; violent people are trying to kill me. And you mean nothing to them.15 But you, O Lord, are a merciful and gracious God, slow to get angry, full of unfailing love and truth.16 Look down and have mercy on me. Give strength to your servant; yes, save me, for I am your servant.17 Send me a sign of your favor. Then those who hate me will be put to shame, for you, O LORD, help and comfort me.
