1  Bless the LORD, who is my rock. He gives me strength for war and skill for battle.2 He is my loving ally and my fortress, my tower of safety, my deliverer. He stands before me as a shield, and I take refuge in him. He subdues the nations[a] under me.3 O LORD, what are mortals that you should notice us, mere humans that you should care for us?4 For we are like a breath of air; our days are like a passing shadow.5 Bend down the heavens, LORD, and come down. Touch the mountains so they billow smoke.6 Release your lightning bolts and scatter your enemies! Release your arrows and confuse them!7 Reach down from heaven and rescue me; deliver me from deep waters, from the power of my enemies.8 Their mouths are full of lies; they swear to tell the truth, but they lie.9 I will sing a new song to you, O God! I will sing your praises with a ten-stringed harp.10 For you grant victory to kings! You are the one who rescued your servant David.11 Save me from the fatal sword! Rescue me from the power of my enemies. Their mouths are full of lies; they swear to tell the truth, but they lie.12 May our sons flourish in their youth like well-nurtured plants. May our daughters be like graceful pillars, carved to beautify a palace.13 May our farms be filled with crops of every kind. May the flocks in our fields multiply by the thousands, even tens of thousands,14 and may our oxen be loaded down with produce. May there be no breached walls, no forced exile, no cries of distress in our squares.15 Yes, happy are those who have it like this! Happy indeed are those whose God is the LORD.
