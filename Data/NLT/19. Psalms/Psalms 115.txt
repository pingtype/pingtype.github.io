1 Not to us, O Lord , not to us, but to your name goes all the glory for your unfailing love and faithfulness.2 Why let the nations say, "Where is their God?"3 Our God is in the heavens, and he does as he wishes.4 Their idols are merely things of silver and gold, shaped by human hands.5 They have mouths but cannot speak, and eyes but cannot see.6 They have ears but cannot hear, and noses but cannot smell.7 They have hands but cannot feel, and feet but cannot walk, and throats but cannot make a sound.8 And those who make idols are just like them, as are all who trust in them.9 O Israel, trust the Lord ! He is your helper and your shield.10 O priests, descendants of Aaron, trust the Lord ! He is your helper and your shield.11 All you who fear the Lord , trust the Lord ! He is your helper and your shield.12 The Lord  remembers us and will bless us. He will bless the people of Israel and bless the priests, the descendants of Aaron.13 He will bless those who fear the Lord , both great and lowly.14 May the Lord  richly bless both you and your children.15 May you be blessed by the Lord , who made heaven and earth.16 The heavens belong to the Lord , but he has given the earth to all humanity.17 The dead cannot sing praises to the Lord , for they have gone into the silence of the grave.18 But we can praise the Lord  both now and forever! Praise the Lord !       Footnotes:
