1 The Lord  is king! He is robed in majesty. Indeed, the Lord  is robed in majesty and armed with strength. The world stands firm and cannot be shaken.2 Your throne, O Lord , has stood from time immemorial. You yourself are from the everlasting past.3 The floods have risen up, O Lord . The floods have roared like thunder; the floods have lifted their pounding waves.4 But mightier than the violent raging of the seas, mightier than the breakers on the shore- the Lord  above is mightier than these!5 Your royal laws cannot be changed. Your reign, O Lord , is holy forever and ever.       Footnotes:
