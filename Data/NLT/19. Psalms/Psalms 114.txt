1 When the Israelites escaped from Egypt- when the family of Jacob left that foreign land-2 the land of Judah became God's sanctuary, and Israel became his kingdom.3 The Red Sea[a] saw them coming and hurried out of their way! The water of the Jordan River turned away.4 The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs!5 What's wrong, Red Sea, that made you hurry out of their way? What happened, Jordan River, that you turned away?6 Why, mountains, did you skip like rams? Why, hills, like lambs?7 Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob.8 He turned the rock into a pool of water; yes, a spring of water flowed from solid rock.       Footnotes:a.   114:3 Hebrew the sea; also in 114:5.
