1  Praise the LORD! Sing to the LORD a new song. Sing his praises in the assembly of the faithful.2 O Israel, rejoice in your Maker. O people of Jerusalem,[a] exult in your King.3 Praise his name with dancing, accompanied by tambourine and harp.4 For the LORD delights in his people; he crowns the humble with salvation.5 Let the faithful rejoice in this honor. Let them sing for joy as they lie on their beds.6 Let the praises of God be in their mouths, and a sharp sword in their hands--7 to execute vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples,8 to bind their kings with shackles and their leaders with iron chains,9 to execute the judgment written against them. This is the glory of his faithful ones. Praise the LORD!
