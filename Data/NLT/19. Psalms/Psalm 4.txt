1  Answer me when I call, O God who declares me innocent. Take away my distress. Have mercy on me and hear my prayer.
2 How long will you people ruin my reputation? How long will you make these groundless accusations? How long will you pursue lies?
3 You can be sure of this: The LORD has set apart the godly for himself. The LORD will answer when I call to him.
4 Don't sin by letting anger gain control over you. Think about it overnight and remain silent.
5 Offer proper sacrifices, and trust in the LORD.
6 Many people say, "Who will show us better times?" Let the smile of your face shine on us, LORD.
7 You have given me greater joy than those who have abundant harvests of grain and wine.
8 I will lie down in peace and sleep, for you alone, O LORD, will keep me safe.
