For the choir director: A psalm of David. 1 I trust in the Lord  for protection. So why do you say to me, "Fly like a bird to the mountains for safety!2 The wicked are stringing their bows and fitting their arrows on the bowstrings. They shoot from the shadows at those whose hearts are right.3 The foundations of law and order have collapsed. What can the righteous do?"4 But the Lord  is in his holy Temple; the Lord  still rules from heaven. He watches everyone closely, examining every person on earth.5 The Lord  examines both the righteous and the wicked. He hates those who love violence.6 He will rain down blazing coals and burning sulfur on the wicked, punishing them with scorching winds.7 For the righteous Lord  loves justice. The virtuous will see his face.
