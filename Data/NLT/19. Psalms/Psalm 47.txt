1  Come, everyone, and clap your hands for joy! Shout to God with joyful praise!2 For the LORD Most High is awesome. He is the great King of all the earth.3 He subdues the nations before us, putting our enemies beneath our feet.4 He chose the Promised Land as our inheritance, the proud possession of Jacob's descendants, whom he loves.5 God has ascended with a mighty shout. The LORD has ascended with trumpets blaring.6 Sing praise to God, sing praises; sing praise to our King, sing praises!7 For God is the King over all the earth. Praise him with a psalm!8 God reigns above the nations, sitting on his holy throne.9 The rulers of the world have gathered together. They join us in praising the God of Abraham. For all the kings of the earth belong to God. He is highly honored everywhere.
