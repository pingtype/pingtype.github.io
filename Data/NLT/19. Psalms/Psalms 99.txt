1 The Lord  is king! Let the nations tremble! He sits on his throne between the cherubim. Let the whole earth quake!2 The Lord  sits in majesty in Jerusalem,[a]exalted above all the nations.3 Let them praise your great and awesome name. Your name is holy!4 Mighty King, lover of justice, you have established fairness. You have acted with justice and righteousness throughout Israel.[b]5 Exalt the Lord  our God! Bow low before his feet, for he is holy!6 Moses and Aaron were among his priests; Samuel also called on his name. They cried to the Lord  for help, and he answered them.7 He spoke to Israel from the pillar of cloud, and they followed the laws and decrees he gave them.8 O Lord  our God, you answered them. You were a forgiving God to them, but you punished them when they went wrong.9 Exalt the Lord  our God, and worship at his holy mountain in Jerusalem, for the Lord  our God is holy!       Footnotes:a.   99:2 Hebrew Zion.  b.   99:4 Hebrew Jacob.
