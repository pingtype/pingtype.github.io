For the choir director: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by stringed instruments. 1 O God, listen to my cry! Hear my prayer!
2 From the ends of the earth, I cry to you for help when my heart is overwhelmed. Lead me to the towering rock of safety,
3 for you are my safe refuge, a fortress where my enemies cannot reach me.
4 Let me live forever in your sanctuary, safe beneath the shelter of your wings! Interlude
5 For you have heard my vows, O God. You have given me an inheritance reserved for those who fear your name.
6 Add many years to the life of the king! May his years span the generations!
7 May he reign under God's protection forever. May your unfailing love and faithfulness watch over him.
8 Then I will sing praises to your name forever as I fulfill my vows each day.
