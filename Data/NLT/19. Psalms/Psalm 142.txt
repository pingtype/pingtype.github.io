1  I cry out to the LORD; I plead for the LORD's mercy.2 I pour out my complaints before him and tell him all my troubles.3 For I am overwhelmed, and you alone know the way I should turn. Wherever I go, my enemies have set traps for me.4 I look for someone to come and help me, but no one gives me a passing thought! No one will help me; no one cares a bit what happens to me.5 Then I pray to you, O LORD. I say, "You are my place of refuge. You are all I really want in life.6 Hear my cry, for I am very low. Rescue me from my persecutors, for they are too strong for me.7 Bring me out of prison so I can thank you. The godly will crowd around me, for you treat me kindly."
