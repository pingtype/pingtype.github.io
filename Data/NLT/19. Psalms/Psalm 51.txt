1  Have mercy on me, O God, because of your unfailing love. Because of your great compassion, blot out the stain of my sins.2 Wash me clean from my guilt. Purify me from my sin.3 For I recognize my shameful deeds-- they haunt me day and night.4 Against you, and you alone, have I sinned; I have done what is evil in your sight. You will be proved right in what you say, and your judgment against me is just.5 For I was born a sinner-- yes, from the moment my mother conceived me.6 But you desire honesty from the heart, so you can teach me to be wise in my inmost being.7 Purify me from my sins,[a] and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.8 Oh, give me back my joy again; you have broken me-- now let me rejoice.9 Don't keep looking at my sins. Remove the stain of my guilt.10 Create in me a clean heart, O God. Renew a right spirit within me.11 Do not banish me from your presence, and don't take your Holy Spirit from me.12 Restore to me again the joy of your salvation, and make me willing to obey you.13 Then I will teach your ways to sinners, and they will return to you.14 Forgive me for shedding blood, O God who saves; then I will joyfully sing of your forgiveness.15 Unseal my lips, O Lord, that I may praise you.16 You would not be pleased with sacrifices, or I would bring them. If I brought you a burnt offering, you would not accept it.17 The sacrifice you want is a broken spirit. A broken and repentant heart, O God, you will not despise.18 Look with favor on Zion and help her; rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.19 Then you will be pleased with worthy sacrifices and with our whole burnt offerings; and bulls will again be sacrificed on your altar.
