1  Come, let us sing to the LORD! Let us give a joyous shout to the rock of our salvation!2 Let us come before him with thanksgiving. Let us sing him psalms of praise.3 For the LORD is a great God, the great King above all gods.4 He owns the depths of the earth, and even the mightiest mountains are his.5 The sea belongs to him, for he made it. His hands formed the dry land, too.6 Come, let us worship and bow down. Let us kneel before the LORD our maker,7 for he is our God. We are the people he watches over, the sheep under his care. Oh, that you would listen to his voice today!8 The LORD says, "Don't harden your hearts as Israel did at Meribah, as they did at Massah in the wilderness.9 For there your ancestors tried my patience; they courted my wrath though they had seen my many miracles.10 For forty years I was angry with them, and I said, `They are a people whose hearts turn away from me. They refuse to do what I tell them.'11 So in my anger I made a vow: `They will never enter my place of rest.'"
