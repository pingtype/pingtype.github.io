1  God presides over heaven's court; he pronounces judgment on the judges:2 "How long will you judges hand down unjust decisions? How long will you shower special favors on the wicked?3 "Give fair judgment to the poor and the orphan; uphold the rights of the oppressed and the destitute.4 Rescue the poor and helpless; deliver them from the grasp of evil people.5 But these oppressors know nothing; they are so ignorant! And because they are in darkness, the whole world is shaken to the core.6 I say, `You are gods and children of the Most High.7 But in death you are mere men. You will fall as any prince, for all must die.' "8 Rise up, O God, and judge the earth, for all the nations belong to you.
