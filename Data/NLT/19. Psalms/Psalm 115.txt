1  Not to us, O LORD, but to you goes all the glory for your unfailing love and faithfulness.2 Why let the nations say, "Where is their God?"3 For our God is in the heavens, and he does as he wishes.4 Their idols are merely things of silver and gold, shaped by human hands.5 They cannot talk, though they have mouths, or see, though they have eyes!6 They cannot hear with their ears, or smell with their noses,7 or feel with their hands, or walk with their feet, or utter sounds with their throats!8 And those who make them are just like them, as are all who trust in them.9 O Israel, trust the LORD! He is your helper; he is your shield.10 O priests of Aaron, trust the LORD! He is your helper; he is your shield.11 All you who fear the LORD, trust the LORD! He is your helper; he is your shield.12 The LORD remembers us, and he will surely bless us. He will bless the people of Israel and the family of Aaron, the priests.13 He will bless those who fear the LORD, both great and small.14 May the LORD richly bless both you and your children.15 May you be blessed by the LORD, who made heaven and earth.16 The heavens belong to the LORD, but he has given the earth to all humanity.17 The dead cannot sing praises to the LORD, for they have gone into the silence of the grave.18 But we can praise the LORD both now and forever! Praise the LORD!
