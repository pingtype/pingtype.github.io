1 The Lord  is king! Let the earth rejoice! Let the farthest coastlands be glad.2 Dark clouds surround him. Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.3 Fire spreads ahead of him and burns up all his foes.4 His lightning flashes out across the world. The earth sees and trembles.5 The mountains melt like wax before the Lord , before the Lord of all the earth.6 The heavens proclaim his righteousness; every nation sees his glory.7 Those who worship idols are disgraced- all who brag about their worthless gods- for every god must bow to him.8 Jerusalem[a] has heard and rejoiced, and all the towns of Judah are glad because of your justice, O Lord !9 For you, O Lord , are supreme over all the earth; you are exalted far above all gods.10 You who love the Lord , hate evil! He protects the lives of his godly people and rescues them from the power of the wicked.11 Light shines on the godly, and joy on those whose hearts are right.12 May all who are godly rejoice in the Lord  and praise his holy name!       Footnotes:a.   97:8 Hebrew Zion.
