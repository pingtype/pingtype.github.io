A song for pilgrims ascending to Jerusalem. 1 Those who trust in the Lord  are as secure as Mount Zion; they will not be defeated but will endure forever.2 Just as the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the Lord  surrounds his people, both now and forever.3 The wicked will not rule the land of the godly, for then the godly might be tempted to do wrong.4 O Lord , do good to those who are good, whose hearts are in tune with you.5 But banish those who turn to crooked ways, O Lord . Take them away with those who do evil. May Israel have peace!
