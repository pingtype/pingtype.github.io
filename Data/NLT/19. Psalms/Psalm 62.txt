1  I wait quietly before God, for my salvation comes from him.2 He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress where I will never be shaken.3 So many enemies against one man-- all of them trying to kill me. To them I'm just a broken-down wall or a tottering fence.4 They plan to topple me from my high position. They delight in telling lies about me. They are friendly to my face, but they curse me in their hearts.5 I wait quietly before God, for my hope is in him.6 He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress where I will not be shaken.7 My salvation and my honor come from God alone. He is my refuge, a rock where no enemy can reach me.8 O my people, trust in him at all times. Pour out your heart to him, for God is our refuge.9 From the greatest to the lowliest-- all are nothing in his sight. If you weigh them on the scales, they are lighter than a puff of air.10 Don't try to get rich by extortion or robbery. And if your wealth increases, don't make it the center of your life.11 God has spoken plainly, and I have heard it many times: Power, O God, belongs to you;12 unfailing love, O Lord, is yours. Surely you judge all people according to what they have done.
