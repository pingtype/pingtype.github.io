1  Those who trust in the LORD are as secure as Mount Zion; they will not be defeated but will endure forever.2 Just as the mountains surround and protect Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds and protects his people, both now and forever.3 The wicked will not rule the godly, for then the godly might be forced to do wrong.4 O LORD, do good to those who are good, whose hearts are in tune with you.5 But banish those who turn to crooked ways, O LORD. Take them away with those who do evil. And let Israel have quietness and peace.
