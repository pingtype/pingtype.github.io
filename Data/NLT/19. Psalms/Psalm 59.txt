1  Rescue me from my enemies, O God. Protect me from those who have come to destroy me.2 Rescue me from these criminals; save me from these murderers.3 They have set an ambush for me. Fierce enemies are out there waiting, though I have done them no wrong, O LORD.4 Despite my innocence, they prepare to kill me. Rise up and help me! Look on my plight!5 O LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, rise up to punish hostile nations. Show no mercy to wicked traitors.6 They come at night, snarling like vicious dogs as they prowl the streets.7 Listen to the filth that comes from their mouths, the piercing swords that fly from their lips. "Who can hurt us?" they sneer.8 But LORD, you laugh at them. You scoff at all the hostile nations.9 You are my strength; I wait for you to rescue me, for you, O God, are my place of safety.10 In his unfailing love, my God will come and help me. He will let me look down in triumph on all my enemies.11 Don't kill them, for my people soon forget such lessons; stagger them with your power, and bring them to their knees, O Lord our shield.12 Because of the sinful things they say, because of the evil that is on their lips, let them be captured by their pride, their curses, and their lies.13 Destroy them in your anger! Wipe them out completely! Then the whole world will know that God reigns in Israel.[a] 14 My enemies come out at night, snarling like vicious dogs as they prowl the streets.15 They scavenge for food but go to sleep unsatisfied.[b]16 But as for me, I will sing about your power. I will shout with joy each morning because of your unfailing love. For you have been my refuge, a place of safety in the day of distress.17 O my Strength, to you I sing praises, for you, O God, are my refuge, the God who shows me unfailing love.
