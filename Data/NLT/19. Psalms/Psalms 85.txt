For the choir director: A psalm of the descendants of Korah. 1 Lord , you poured out blessings on your land! You restored the fortunes of Israel.*You forgave the guilt of your people- yes, you covered all their sins. Interlude
3 You held back your fury. You kept back your blazing anger.
4 Now restore us again, O God of our salvation. Put aside your anger against us once more.
5 Will you be angry with us always? Will you prolong your wrath to all generations?
6 Won't you revive us again, so your people can rejoice in you?
7 Show us your unfailing love, O Lord , and grant us your salvation.
8 I listen carefully to what God the Lord  is saying, for he speaks peace to his faithful people. But let them not return to their foolish ways.
9 Surely his salvation is near to those who fear him, so our land will be filled with his glory.
10 Unfailing love and truth have met together. Righteousness and peace have kissed!
11 Truth springs up from the earth, and righteousness smiles down from heaven.
12 Yes, the Lord  pours down his blessings. Our land will yield its bountiful harvest.
13 Righteousness goes as a herald before him, preparing the way for his steps.
