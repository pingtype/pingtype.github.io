For the choir director: A psalm of David. 1 O Lord , how long will you forget me? Forever? How long will you look the other way?2 How long must I struggle with anguish in my soul, with sorrow in my heart every day? How long will my enemy have the upper hand?3 Turn and answer me, O Lord  my God! Restore the sparkle to my eyes, or I will die.4 Don't let my enemies gloat, saying, "We have defeated him!" Don't let them rejoice at my downfall.5 But I trust in your unfailing love. I will rejoice because you have rescued me.6 I will sing to the Lord  because he is good to me.
