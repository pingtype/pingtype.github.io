1  Who may worship in your sanctuary, LORD? Who may enter your presence on your holy hill?2 Those who lead blameless lives and do what is right, speaking the truth from sincere hearts.3 Those who refuse to slander others or harm their neighbors or speak evil of their friends.4 Those who despise persistent sinners, and honor the faithful followers of the LORD and keep their promises even when it hurts.5 Those who do not charge interest on the money they lend, and who refuse to accept bribes to testify against the innocent. Such people will stand firm forever.
