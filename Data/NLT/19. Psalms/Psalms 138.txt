A psalm of David. 1 I give you thanks, O Lord , with all my heart; I will sing your praises before the gods.2 I bow before your holy Temple as I worship. I praise your name for your unfailing love and faithfulness; for your promises are backed by all the honor of your name.3 As soon as I pray, you answer me; you encourage me by giving me strength.4 Every king in all the earth will thank you, Lord , for all of them will hear your words.5 Yes, they will sing about the Lord 's ways, for the glory of the Lord  is very great.6 Though the Lord  is great, he cares for the humble, but he keeps his distance from the proud.7 Though I am surrounded by troubles, you will protect me from the anger of my enemies. You reach out your hand, and the power of your right hand saves me.8 The Lord  will work out his plans for my life- for your faithful love, O Lord , endures forever. Don't abandon me, for you made me.
