1  The earth is the LORD's, and everything in it. The world and all its people belong to him.2 For he laid the earth's foundation on the seas and built it on the ocean depths.3 Who may climb the mountain of the LORD? Who may stand in his holy place?4 Only those whose hands and hearts are pure, who do not worship idols and never tell lies.5 They will receive the LORD's blessing and have right standing with God their savior.6 They alone may enter God's presence and worship the God of Israel.[a] 7 Open up, ancient gates! Open up, ancient doors, and let the King of glory enter.8 Who is the King of glory? The LORD, strong and mighty, the LORD, invincible in battle.9 Open up, ancient gates! Open up, ancient doors, and let the King of glory enter.10 Who is the King of glory? The LORD Almighty-- he is the King of glory.
