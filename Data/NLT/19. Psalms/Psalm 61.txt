1  O God, listen to my cry! Hear my prayer!2 From the ends of the earth, I will cry to you for help, for my heart is overwhelmed. Lead me to the towering rock of safety,3 for you are my safe refuge, a fortress where my enemies cannot reach me.4 Let me live forever in your sanctuary, safe beneath the shelter of your wings!5 For you have heard my vows, O God. You have given me an inheritance reserved for those who fear your name.6 Add many years to the life of the king! May his years span the generations!7 May he reign under God's protection forever. Appoint your unfailing love and faithfulness to watch over him.8 Then I will always sing praises to your name as I fulfill my vows day after day.
