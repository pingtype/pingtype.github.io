1 Sing a new song to the Lord ! Let the whole earth sing to the Lord !2 Sing to the Lord ; praise his name. Each day proclaim the good news that he saves.3 Publish his glorious deeds among the nations. Tell everyone about the amazing things he does.4 Great is the Lord ! He is most worthy of praise! He is to be feared above all gods.5 The gods of other nations are mere idols, but the Lord  made the heavens!6 Honor and majesty surround him; strength and beauty fill his sanctuary.7 O nations of the world, recognize the Lord ; recognize that the Lord  is glorious and strong.8 Give to the Lord  the glory he deserves! Bring your offering and come into his courts.9 Worship the Lord  in all his holy splendor. Let all the earth tremble before him.10 Tell all the nations, "The Lord  reigns!" The world stands firm and cannot be shaken. He will judge all peoples fairly.11 Let the heavens be glad, and the earth rejoice! Let the sea and everything in it shout his praise!12 Let the fields and their crops burst out with joy! Let the trees of the forest sing for joy13 before the Lord , for he is coming! He is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world with justice, and the nations with his truth.
