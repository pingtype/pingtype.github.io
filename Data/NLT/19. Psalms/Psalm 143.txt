1  Hear my prayer, O LORD; listen to my plea! Answer me because you are faithful and righteous.2 Don't bring your servant to trial! Compared to you, no one is perfect.3 My enemy has chased me. He has knocked me to the ground. He forces me to live in darkness like those in the grave.4 I am losing all hope; I am paralyzed with fear.5 I remember the days of old. I ponder all your great works. I think about what you have done.6 I reach out for you. I thirst for you as parched land thirsts for rain.7 Come quickly, LORD, and answer me, for my depression deepens. Don't turn away from me, or I will die.8 Let me hear of your unfailing love to me in the morning, for I am trusting you. Show me where to walk, for I have come to you in prayer.9 Save me from my enemies, LORD; I run to you to hide me.10 Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. May your gracious Spirit lead me forward on a firm footing.11 For the glory of your name, O LORD, save me. In your righteousness, bring me out of this distress.12 In your unfailing love, cut off all my enemies and destroy all my foes, for I am your servant.
