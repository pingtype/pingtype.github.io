For the choir director: A psalm of David. 1 Oh, the joys of those who are kind to the poor! The Lord  rescues them when they are in trouble.2 The Lord  protects them and keeps them alive. He gives them prosperity in the land and rescues them from their enemies.3 The Lord  nurses them when they are sick and restores them to health.4 "O Lord ," I prayed, "have mercy on me. Heal me, for I have sinned against you."5 But my enemies say nothing but evil about me. "How soon will he die and be forgotten?" they ask.6 They visit me as if they were my friends, but all the while they gather gossip, and when they leave, they spread it everywhere.7 All who hate me whisper about me, imagining the worst.8 "He has some fatal disease," they say. "He will never get out of that bed!"9 Even my best friend, the one I trusted completely, the one who shared my food, has turned against me.10 Lord , have mercy on me. Make me well again, so I can pay them back!11 I know you are pleased with me, for you have not let my enemies triumph over me.12 You have preserved my life because I am innocent; you have brought me into your presence forever.13 Praise the Lord , the God of Israel, who lives from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and amen!
