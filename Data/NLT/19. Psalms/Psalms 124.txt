A song for pilgrims ascending to Jerusalem. A psalm of David. 1 What if the Lord  had not been on our side? Let all Israel repeat:2 What if the Lord  had not been on our side when people attacked us?3 They would have swallowed us alive in their burning anger.4 The waters would have engulfed us; a torrent would have overwhelmed us.5 Yes, the raging waters of their fury would have overwhelmed our very lives.6 Praise the Lord , who did not let their teeth tear us apart!7 We escaped like a bird from a hunter's trap. The trap is broken, and we are free!8 Our help is from the Lord , who made heaven and earth.
