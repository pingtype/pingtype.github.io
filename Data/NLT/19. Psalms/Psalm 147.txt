1  Praise the LORD! How good it is to sing praises to our God! How delightful and how right!2 The LORD is rebuilding Jerusalem and bringing the exiles back to Israel.3 He heals the brokenhearted, binding up their wounds.4 He counts the stars and calls them all by name.5 How great is our Lord! His power is absolute! His understanding is beyond comprehension!6 The LORD supports the humble, but he brings the wicked down into the dust.7 Sing out your thanks to the LORD; sing praises to our God, accompanied by harps.8 He covers the heavens with clouds, provides rain for the earth, and makes the green grass grow in mountain pastures.9 He feeds the wild animals, and the young ravens cry to him for food.10 The strength of a horse does not impress him; how puny in his sight is the strength of a man.11 Rather, the LORD's delight is in those who honor him, those who put their hope in his unfailing love.12 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem! Praise your God, O Zion!13 For he has fortified the bars of your gates and blessed your children within you.14 He sends peace across your nation and satisfies you with plenty of the finest wheat.15 He sends his orders to the world-- how swiftly his word flies!16 He sends the snow like white wool; he scatters frost upon the ground like ashes.17 He hurls the hail like stones. Who can stand against his freezing cold?18 Then, at his command, it all melts. He sends his winds, and the ice thaws.19 He has revealed his words to Jacob, his principles and laws to Israel.20 He has not done this with any other nation; they do not know his laws. Praise the LORD!
