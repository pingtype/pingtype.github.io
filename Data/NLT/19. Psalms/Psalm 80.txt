1  Please listen, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Israel[a] like a flock. O God, enthroned above the cherubim, display your radiant glory2 to Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh. Show us your mighty power. Come to rescue us!3 Turn us again to yourself, O God. Make your face shine down upon us. Only then will we be saved.4 O LORD God Almighty, how long will you be angry and reject our prayers?5 You have fed us with sorrow and made us drink tears by the bucketful.6 You have made us the scorn of neighboring nations. Our enemies treat us as a joke.7 Turn us again to yourself, O God Almighty. Make your face shine down upon us. Only then will we be saved.8 You brought us from Egypt as though we were a tender vine; you drove away the pagan nations and transplanted us into your land.9 You cleared the ground for us, and we took root and filled the land.10 The mountains were covered with our shade; the mighty cedars were covered with our branches.11 We spread our branches west to the Mediterranean Sea, our limbs east to the Euphrates River.[b]12 But now, why have you broken down our walls so that all who pass may steal our fruit?13 The boar from the forest devours us, and the wild animals feed on us.14 Come back, we beg you, O God Almighty. Look down from heaven and see our plight. Watch over and care for this vine15 that you yourself have planted, this son you have raised for yourself.16 For we are chopped up and burned by our enemies. May they perish at the sight of your frown.17 Strengthen the man you love, the son of your choice.18 Then we will never forsake you again. Revive us so we can call on your name once more.19 Turn us again to yourself, O LORD God Almighty. Make your face shine down upon us. Only then will we be saved.
