1  I look up to the mountains-- does my help come from there?2 My help comes from the LORD, who made the heavens and the earth!3 He will not let you stumble and fall; the one who watches over you will not sleep.4 Indeed, he who watches over Israel never tires and never sleeps.5 The LORD himself watches over you! The LORD stands beside you as your protective shade.6 The sun will not hurt you by day, nor the moon at night.7 The LORD keeps you from all evil and preserves your life.8 The LORD keeps watch over you as you come and go, both now and forever.
