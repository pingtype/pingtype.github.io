1  We thank you, O God! We give thanks because you are near. People everywhere tell of your mighty miracles.2 God says, "At the time I have planned, I will bring justice against the wicked.3 When the earth quakes and its people live in turmoil, I am the one who keeps its foundations firm.4 "I warned the proud, `Stop your boasting!' I told the wicked, `Don't raise your fists!5 Don't lift your fists in defiance at the heavens or speak with rebellious arrogance.' "6 For no one on earth--from east or west, or even from the wilderness-- can raise another person up.7 It is God alone who judges; he decides who will rise and who will fall.8 For the LORD holds a cup in his hand; it is full of foaming wine mixed with spices. He pours the wine out in judgment, and all the wicked must drink it, draining it to the dregs.9 But as for me, I will always proclaim what God has done; I will sing praises to the God of Israel.[a]10 For God says, "I will cut off the strength of the wicked, but I will increase the power of the godly."
