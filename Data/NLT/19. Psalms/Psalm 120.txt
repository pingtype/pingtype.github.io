1  I took my troubles to the LORD; I cried out to him, and he answered my prayer.2 Rescue me, O LORD, from liars and from all deceitful people.3 O deceptive tongue, what will God do to you? How will he increase your punishment?4 You will be pierced with sharp arrows and burned with glowing coals.5 How I suffer among these scoundrels of Meshech! It pains me to live with these people from Kedar!6 I am tired of living here among people who hate peace.7 As for me, I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war!
