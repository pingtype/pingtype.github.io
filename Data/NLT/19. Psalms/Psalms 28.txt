A psalm of David. 1 I pray to you, O Lord , my rock. Do not turn a deaf ear to me. For if you are silent, I might as well give up and die.
2 Listen to my prayer for mercy as I cry out to you for help, as I lift my hands toward your holy sanctuary.
3 Do not drag me away with the wicked- with those who do evil- those who speak friendly words to their neighbors while planning evil in their hearts.
4 Give them the punishment they so richly deserve! Measure it out in proportion to their wickedness. Pay them back for all their evil deeds! Give them a taste of what they have done to others.
5 They care nothing for what the Lord  has done or for what his hands have made. So he will tear them down, and they will never be rebuilt!
6 Praise the Lord ! For he has heard my cry for mercy.
7 The Lord  is my strength and shield. I trust him with all my heart. He helps me, and my heart is filled with joy. I burst out in songs of thanksgiving.
8 The Lord  gives his people strength. He is a safe fortress for his anointed king.
9 Save your people! Bless Israel, your special possession.*Lead them like a shepherd, and carry them in your arms forever.
