1  I said to myself, "I will watch what I do and not sin in what I say. I will curb my tongue when the ungodly are around me."2 But as I stood there in silence-- not even speaking of good things-- the turmoil within me grew to the bursting point.3 My thoughts grew hot within me and began to burn, igniting a fire of words:4 "LORD, remind me how brief my time on earth will be. Remind me that my days are numbered, and that my life is fleeing away.5 My life is no longer than the width of my hand. An entire lifetime is just a moment to you; human existence is but a breath."6 We are merely moving shadows, and all our busy rushing ends in nothing. We heap up wealth for someone else to spend.7 And so, Lord, where do I put my hope? My only hope is in you.8 Rescue me from my rebellion, for even fools mock me when I rebel.9 I am silent before you; I won't say a word. For my punishment is from you.10 Please, don't punish me anymore! I am exhausted by the blows from your hand.11 When you discipline people for their sins, their lives can be crushed like the life of a moth. Human existence is as frail as breath.12 Hear my prayer, O LORD! Listen to my cries for help! Don't ignore my tears. For I am your guest-- a traveler passing through, as my ancestors were before me.13 Spare me so I can smile again before I am gone and exist no more.
