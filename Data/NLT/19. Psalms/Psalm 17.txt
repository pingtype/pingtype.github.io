1  O LORD, hear my plea for justice. Listen to my cry for help. Pay attention to my prayer, for it comes from an honest heart.2 Declare me innocent, for you know those who do right.3 You have tested my thoughts and examined my heart in the night. You have scrutinized me and found nothing amiss, for I am determined not to sin in what I say.4 I have followed your commands, which have kept me from going along with cruel and evil people.5 My steps have stayed on your path; I have not wavered from following you.6 I am praying to you because I know you will answer, O God. Bend down and listen as I pray.7 Show me your unfailing love in wonderful ways. You save with your strength those who seek refuge from their enemies.8 Guard me as the apple of your eye. Hide me in the shadow of your wings.9 Protect me from wicked people who attack me, from murderous enemies who surround me.10 They are without pity. Listen to their boasting.11 They track me down, surround me, and throw me to the ground.12 They are like hungry lions, eager to tear me apart-- like young lions in hiding, waiting for their chance.13 Arise, O LORD! Stand against them and bring them to their knees! Rescue me from the wicked with your sword!14 Save me by your mighty hand, O LORD, from those whose only concern is earthly gain. May they have their punishment in full. May their children inherit more of the same, and may the judgment continue to their children's children.15 But because I have done what is right, I will see you. When I awake, I will be fully satisfied, for I will see you face to face.
