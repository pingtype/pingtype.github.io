A song for pilgrims ascending to Jerusalem. 1 Lord , remember David and all that he suffered.2 He made a solemn promise to the Lord . He vowed to the Mighty One of Israel,[a]3 "I will not go home; I will not let myself rest.4 I will not let my eyes sleep nor close my eyelids in slumber5 until I find a place to build a house for the Lord , a sanctuary for the Mighty One of Israel."6 We heard that the Ark was in Ephrathah; then we found it in the distant countryside of Jaar.7 Let us go to the sanctuary of the Lord ; let us worship at the footstool of his throne.8 Arise, O Lord , and enter your resting place, along with the Ark, the symbol of your power.9 May your priests be clothed in godliness; may your loyal servants sing for joy.10 For the sake of your servant David, do not reject the king you have anointed.11 The Lord  swore an oath to David with a promise he will never take back: "I will place one of your descendants on your throne.12 If your descendants obey the terms of my covenant and the laws that I teach them, then your royal line will continue forever and ever."13 For the Lord  has chosen Jerusalem[b]; he has desired it for his home.14 "This is my resting place forever," he said. "I will live here, for this is the home I desired.15 I will bless this city and make it prosperous; I will satisfy its poor with food.16 I will clothe its priests with godliness; its faithful servants will sing for joy.17 Here I will increase the power of David; my anointed one will be a light for my people.18 I will clothe his enemies with shame, but he will be a glorious king."       Footnotes:a.   132:2 Hebrew of Jacob; also in 132:5.
