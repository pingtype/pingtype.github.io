A psalm[a] of David. 1 Keep me safe, O God, for I have come to you for refuge.2 I said to the Lord , "You are my Master! Every good thing I have comes from you."3 The godly people in the land are my true heroes! I take pleasure in them!4 Troubles multiply for those who chase after other gods. I will not take part in their sacrifices of blood or even speak the names of their gods.5 Lord , you alone are my inheritance, my cup of blessing. You guard all that is mine.6 The land you have given me is a pleasant land. What a wonderful inheritance!7 I will bless the Lord  who guides me; even at night my heart instructs me.8 I know the Lord  is always with me. I will not be shaken, for he is right beside me.9 No wonder my heart is glad, and I rejoice.[b]My body rests in safety.10 For you will not leave my soul among the dead[c]or allow your holy one[d] to rot in the grave.11 You will show me the way of life, granting me the joy of your presence and the pleasures of living with you forever.[e]Footnotes:a.   16:TITLE  Hebrew miktam.
