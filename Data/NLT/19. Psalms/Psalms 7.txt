A psalm* of David, which he sang to the Lord  concerning Cush of the tribe of Benjamin. 1 I come to you for protection, O Lord  my God. Save me from my persecutors-rescue me!
2 If you don't, they will maul me like a lion, tearing me to pieces with no one to rescue me.
3 O Lord  my God, if I have done wrong or am guilty of injustice,
4 if I have betrayed a friend or plundered my enemy without cause,
5 then let my enemies capture me. Let them trample me into the ground and drag my honor in the dust. Interlude
6 Arise, O Lord , in anger! Stand up against the fury of my enemies! Wake up, my God, and bring justice!
7 Gather the nations before you. Rule over them from on high.
8 The Lord  judges the nations. Declare me righteous, O Lord , for I am innocent, O Most High!
9 End the evil of those who are wicked, and defend the righteous. For you look deep within the mind and heart, O righteous God.
10 God is my shield, saving those whose hearts are true and right.
11 God is an honest judge. He is angry with the wicked every day.
12 If a person does not repent, God* will sharpen his sword; he will bend and string his bow.
13 He will prepare his deadly weapons and shoot his flaming arrows.
14 The wicked conceive evil; they are pregnant with trouble and give birth to lies.
15 They dig a deep pit to trap others, then fall into it themselves.
16 The trouble they make for others backfires on them. The violence they plan falls on their own heads.
17 I will thank the Lord  because he is just; I will sing praise to the name of the Lord  Most High.
