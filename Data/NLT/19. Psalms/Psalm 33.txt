1  Let the godly sing with joy to the LORD, for it is fitting to praise him.2 Praise the LORD with melodies on the lyre; make music for him on the ten-stringed harp.3 Sing new songs of praise to him; play skillfully on the harp and sing with joy.4 For the word of the LORD holds true, and everything he does is worthy of our trust.5 He loves whatever is just and good, and his unfailing love fills the earth.6 The LORD merely spoke, and the heavens were created. He breathed the word, and all the stars were born.7 He gave the sea its boundaries and locked the oceans in vast reservoirs.8 Let everyone in the world fear the LORD, and let everyone stand in awe of him.9 For when he spoke, the world began! It appeared at his command.10 The LORD shatters the plans of the nations and thwarts all their schemes.11 But the LORD's plans stand firm forever; his intentions can never be shaken.12 What joy for the nation whose God is the LORD, whose people he has chosen for his own.13 The LORD looks down from heaven and sees the whole human race.14 From his throne he observes all who live on the earth.15 He made their hearts, so he understands everything they do.16 The best-equipped army cannot save a king, nor is great strength enough to save a warrior.17 Don't count on your warhorse to give you victory-- for all its strength, it cannot save you.18 But the LORD watches over those who fear him, those who rely on his unfailing love.19 He rescues them from death and keeps them alive in times of famine.20 We depend on the LORD alone to save us. Only he can help us, protecting us like a shield.21 In him our hearts rejoice, for we are trusting in his holy name.22 Let your unfailing love surround us, LORD, for our hope is in you alone.
