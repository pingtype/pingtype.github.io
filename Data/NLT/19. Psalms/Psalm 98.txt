1  Sing a new song to the LORD, for he has done wonderful deeds. He has won a mighty victory by his power and holiness.2 The LORD has announced his victory and has revealed his righteousness to every nation!3 He has remembered his promise to love and be faithful to Israel. The whole earth has seen the salvation of our God.4 Shout to the LORD, all the earth; break out in praise and sing for joy!5 Sing your praise to the LORD with the harp, with the harp and melodious song,6 with trumpets and the sound of the ram's horn. Make a joyful symphony before the LORD, the King!7 Let the sea and everything in it shout his praise! Let the earth and all living things join in.8 Let the rivers clap their hands in glee! Let the hills sing out their songs of joy9 before the LORD. For the LORD is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world with justice, and the nations with fairness.
