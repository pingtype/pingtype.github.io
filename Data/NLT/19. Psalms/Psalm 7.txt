1  I come to you for protection, O LORD my God. Save me from my persecutors--rescue me!2 If you don't, they will maul me like a lion, tearing me to pieces with no one to rescue me.3 O LORD my God, if I have done wrong or am guilty of injustice,4 if I have betrayed a friend or plundered my enemy without cause,5 then let my enemies capture me. Let them trample me into the ground. Let my honor be left in the dust.6 Arise, O LORD, in anger! Stand up against the fury of my enemies! Wake up, my God, and bring justice!7 Gather the nations before you. Sit on your throne high above them.8 The LORD passes judgment on the nations. Declare me righteous, O LORD, for I am innocent, O Most High!9 End the wickedness of the ungodly, but help all those who obey you. For you look deep within the mind and heart, O righteous God.10 God is my shield, saving those whose hearts are true and right.11 God is a judge who is perfectly fair. He is angry with the wicked every day.12 If a person does not repent, God[a] will sharpen his sword; he will bend and string his bow.13 He will prepare his deadly weapons and ignite his flaming arrows.14 The wicked conceive evil; they are pregnant with trouble and give birth to lies.15 They dig a pit to trap others and then fall into it themselves.16 They make trouble, but it backfires on them. They plan violence for others, but it falls on their own heads.17 I will thank the LORD because he is just; I will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.
