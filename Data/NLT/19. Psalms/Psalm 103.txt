1  Praise the LORD, I tell myself; with my whole heart, I will praise his holy name.2 Praise the LORD, I tell myself, and never forget the good things he does for me.3 He forgives all my sins and heals all my diseases.4 He ransoms me from death and surrounds me with love and tender mercies.5 He fills my life with good things. My youth is renewed like the eagle's!6 The LORD gives righteousness and justice to all who are treated unfairly.7 He revealed his character to Moses and his deeds to the people of Israel.8 The LORD is merciful and gracious; he is slow to get angry and full of unfailing love.9 He will not constantly accuse us, nor remain angry forever.10 He has not punished us for all our sins, nor does he deal with us as we deserve.11 For his unfailing love toward those who fear him is as great as the height of the heavens above the earth.12 He has removed our rebellious acts as far away from us as the east is from the west.13 The LORD is like a father to his children, tender and compassionate to those who fear him.14 For he understands how weak we are; he knows we are only dust.15 Our days on earth are like grass; like wildflowers, we bloom and die.16 The wind blows, and we are gone-- as though we had never been here.17 But the love of the LORD remains forever with those who fear him. His salvation extends to the children's children18 of those who are faithful to his covenant, of those who obey his commandments!19 The LORD has made the heavens his throne; from there he rules over everything.20 Praise the LORD, you angels of his, you mighty creatures who carry out his plans, listening for each of his commands.21 Yes, praise the LORD, you armies of angels who serve him and do his will!22 Praise the LORD, everything he has created, everywhere in his kingdom. As for me--I, too, will praise the LORD.
