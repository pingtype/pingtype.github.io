A song. A psalm of the descendants of Korah. 1 On the holy mountain stands the city founded by the Lord .
2 He loves the city of Jerusalem more than any other city in Israel.*O city of God, what glorious things are said of you! Interlude
4 I will count Egypt* and Babylon among those who know me- also Philistia and Tyre, and even distant Ethiopia.*They have all become citizens of Jerusalem!
5 Regarding Jerusalem* it will be said, "Everyone enjoys the rights of citizenship there." And the Most High will personally bless this city.
6 When the Lord  registers the nations, he will say, "They have all become citizens of Jerusalem." Interlude
7 The people will play flutes* and sing, "The source of my life springs from Jerusalem!"
