1  On the holy mountain stands the city founded by the LORD.2 He loves the city of Jerusalem more than any other city in Israel.[a]3 O city of God, what glorious things are said of you!4 I will record Egypt[b] and Babylon among those who know me-- also Philistia and Tyre, and even distant Ethiopia.[c] They have all become citizens of Jerusalem!5 And it will be said of Jerusalem,[d] "Everyone has become a citizen here." And the Most High will personally bless this city.6 When the LORD registers the nations, he will say, "This one has become a citizen of Jerusalem."7 At all the festivals, the people will sing, "The source of my life is in Jerusalem!"
