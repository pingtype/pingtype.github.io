For the choir director: A psalm* of David, regarding the time he fled from Saul and went into the cave. To be sung to the tune "Do Not Destroy!" 1 Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy! I look to you for protection. I will hide beneath the shadow of your wings until the danger passes by.
2 I cry out to God Most High,*to God who will fulfill his purpose for me.
3 He will send help from heaven to rescue me, disgracing those who hound me. Interlude My God will send forth his unfailing love and faithfulness.
4 I am surrounded by fierce lions who greedily devour human prey- whose teeth pierce like spears and arrows, and whose tongues cut like swords.
5 Be exalted, O God, above the highest heavens! May your glory shine over all the earth.
6 My enemies have set a trap for me. I am weary from distress. They have dug a deep pit in my path, but they themselves have fallen into it. Interlude
7 My heart is confident in you, O God; my heart is confident. No wonder I can sing your praises!
8 Wake up, my heart! Wake up, O lyre and harp! I will wake the dawn with my song.
9 I will thank you, Lord, among all the people. I will sing your praises among the nations.
10 For your unfailing love is as high as the heavens. Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.
11 Be exalted, O God, above the highest heavens. May your glory shine over all the earth.
