1  Only fools say in their hearts, "There is no God." They are corrupt, and their actions are evil; no one does good!2 The LORD looks down from heaven on the entire human race; he looks to see if there is even one with real understanding, one who seeks for God.3 But no, all have turned away from God; all have become corrupt. No one does good, not even one!4 Will those who do evil never learn? They eat up my people like bread; they wouldn't think of praying to the LORD.5 Terror will grip them, for God is with those who obey him.6 The wicked frustrate the plans of the oppressed, but the LORD will protect his people.7 Oh, that salvation would come from Mount Zion to rescue Israel! For when the LORD restores his people, Jacob will shout with joy, and Israel will rejoice.
