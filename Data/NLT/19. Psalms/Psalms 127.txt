A song for pilgrims ascending to Jerusalem. A psalm of Solomon. 1 Unless the Lord  builds a house, the work of the builders is wasted. Unless the Lord  protects a city, guarding it with sentries will do no good.2 It is useless for you to work so hard from early morning until late at night, anxiously working for food to eat; for God gives rest to his loved ones.3 Children are a gift from the Lord ; they are a reward from him.4 Children born to a young man are like arrows in a warrior's hands.5 How joyful is the man whose quiver is full of them! He will not be put to shame when he confronts his accusers at the city gates.
