For the choir director: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by a stringed instrument.*O Lord , our Lord, your majestic name fills the earth! Your glory is higher than the heavens.
2 You have taught children and infants to tell of your strength,*silencing your enemies and all who oppose you.
3 When I look at the night sky and see the work of your fingers- the moon and the stars you set in place-
4 what are mere mortals that you should think about them, human beings that you should care for them?*Yet you made them only a little lower than God*and crowned them* with glory and honor.
6 You gave them charge of everything you made, putting all things under their authority-
7 the flocks and the herds and all the wild animals,
8 the birds in the sky, the fish in the sea, and everything that swims the ocean currents.
9 O Lord , our Lord, your majestic name fills the earth!
