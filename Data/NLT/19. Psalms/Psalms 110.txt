A psalm of David. 1 The Lord  said to my Lord,[a]"Sit in the place of honor at my right hand until I humble your enemies, making them a footstool under your feet."2 The Lord  will extend your powerful kingdom from Jerusalem[b]; you will rule over your enemies.3 When you go to war, your people will serve you willingly. You are arrayed in holy garments, and your strength will be renewed each day like the morning dew.4 The Lord  has taken an oath and will not break his vow: "You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek."5 The Lord stands at your right hand to protect you. He will strike down many kings when his anger erupts.6 He will punish the nations and fill their lands with corpses; he will shatter heads over the whole earth.7 But he himself will be refreshed from brooks along the way. He will be victorious.       Footnotes:a.   110:1 Or my lord.  b.   110:2 Hebrew Zion.
