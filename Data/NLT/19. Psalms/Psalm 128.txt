1  How happy are those who fear the LORD-- all who follow his ways!2 You will enjoy the fruit of your labor. How happy you will be! How rich your life!3 Your wife will be like a fruitful vine, flourishing within your home. And look at all those children! There they sit around your table as vigorous and healthy as young olive trees.4 That is the LORD's reward for those who fear him.5 May the LORD continually bless you from Zion. May you see Jerusalem prosper as long as you live.6 May you live to enjoy your grandchildren. And may Israel have quietness and peace.
