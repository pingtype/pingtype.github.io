Bring your offering and come to worship him.9 Worship the LORD in all his holy splendor. Let all the earth tremble before him.10 Tell all the nations that the LORD is king. The world is firmly established and cannot be shaken. He will judge all peoples fairly.11 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice! Let the sea and everything in it shout his praise!12 Let the fields and their crops burst forth with joy! Let the trees of the forest rustle with praise13 before the LORD! For the LORD is coming! He is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness and all the nations with his truth.
