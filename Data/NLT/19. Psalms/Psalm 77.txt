1  I cry out to God without holding back. Oh, that God would listen to me!2 When I was in deep trouble, I searched for the Lord. All night long I pray, with hands lifted toward heaven, pleading. There can be no joy for me until he acts.3 I think of God, and I moan, overwhelmed with longing for his help.4 You don't let me sleep. I am too distressed even to pray!5 I think of the good old days, long since ended,6 when my nights were filled with joyful songs. I search my soul and think about the difference now.7 Has the Lord rejected me forever? Will he never again show me favor?8 Is his unfailing love gone forever? Have his promises permanently failed?9 Has God forgotten to be kind? Has he slammed the door on his compassion?10 And I said, "This is my fate, that the blessings of the Most High have changed to hatred."11 I recall all you have done, O LORD; I remember your wonderful deeds of long ago.12 They are constantly in my thoughts. I cannot stop thinking about them.13 O God, your ways are holy. Is there any god as mighty as you?14 You are the God of miracles and wonders! You demonstrate your awesome power among the nations.15 You have redeemed your people by your strength, the descendants of Jacob and of Joseph by your might.16 When the Red Sea[a] saw you, O God, its waters looked and trembled! The sea quaked to its very depths.17 The clouds poured down their rain; the thunder rolled and crackled in the sky. Your arrows of lightning flashed.18 Your thunder roared from the whirlwind; the lightning lit up the world! The earth trembled and shook.19 Your road led through the sea, your pathway through the mighty waters-- a pathway no one knew was there!20 You led your people along that road like a flock of sheep, with Moses and Aaron as their shepherds.
