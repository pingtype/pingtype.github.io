For the choir director: A psalm of Asaph. A song to be accompanied by stringed instruments. 1 God is honored in Judah; his name is great in Israel.2 Jerusalem[a] is where he lives; Mount Zion is his home.3 There he has broken the fiery arrows of the enemy, the shields and swords and weapons of war. Interlude4 You are glorious and more majestic than the everlasting mountains.[b]5 Our boldest enemies have been plundered. They lie before us in the sleep of death. No warrior could lift a hand against us.6 At the blast of your breath, O God of Jacob, their horses and chariots lay still.7 No wonder you are greatly feared! Who can stand before you when your anger explodes?8 From heaven you sentenced your enemies; the earth trembled and stood silent before you.9 You stand up to judge those who do evil, O God, and to rescue the oppressed of the earth. Interlude10 Human defiance only enhances your glory, for you use it as a weapon.[c]11 Make vows to the Lord  your God, and keep them. Let everyone bring tribute to the Awesome One.12 For he breaks the pride of princes, and the kings of the earth fear him.       Footnotes:a.   76:2 Hebrew Salem, another name for Jerusalem.  b.   76:4 As in Greek version; Hebrew reads than mountains filled with beasts of prey. c.   76:10 The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.
