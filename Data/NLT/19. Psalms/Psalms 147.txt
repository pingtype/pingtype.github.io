1 Praise the Lord ! How good to sing praises to our God! How delightful and how fitting!2 The Lord  is rebuilding Jerusalem and bringing the exiles back to Israel.3 He heals the brokenhearted and bandages their wounds.4 He counts the stars and calls them all by name.5 How great is our Lord! His power is absolute! His understanding is beyond comprehension!6 The Lord  supports the humble, but he brings the wicked down into the dust.7 Sing out your thanks to the Lord ; sing praises to our God with a harp.8 He covers the heavens with clouds, provides rain for the earth, and makes the grass grow in mountain pastures.9 He gives food to the wild animals and feeds the young ravens when they cry.10 He takes no pleasure in the strength of a horse or in human might.11 No, the Lord 's delight is in those who fear him, those who put their hope in his unfailing love.12 Glorify the Lord , O Jerusalem! Praise your God, O Zion!13 For he has strengthened the bars of your gates and blessed your children within your walls.14 He sends peace across your nation and satisfies your hunger with the finest wheat.15 He sends his orders to the world- how swiftly his word flies!16 He sends the snow like white wool; he scatters frost upon the ground like ashes.17 He hurls the hail like stones.[a]Who can stand against his freezing cold?18 Then, at his command, it all melts. He sends his winds, and the ice thaws.19 He has revealed his words to Jacob, his decrees and regulations to Israel.20 He has not done this for any other nation; they do not know his regulations. Praise the Lord !       Footnotes:a.   147:17 Hebrew like bread crumbs.
