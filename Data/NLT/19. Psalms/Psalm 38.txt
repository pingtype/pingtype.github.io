1  O LORD, don't rebuke me in your anger! Don't discipline me in your rage!2 Your arrows have struck deep, and your blows are crushing me.3 Because of your anger, my whole body is sick; my health is broken because of my sins.4 My guilt overwhelms me-- it is a burden too heavy to bear.5 My wounds fester and stink because of my foolish sins.6 I am bent over and racked with pain. My days are filled with grief.7 A raging fever burns within me, and my health is broken.8 I am exhausted and completely crushed. My groans come from an anguished heart.9 You know what I long for, Lord; you hear my every sigh.10 My heart beats wildly, my strength fails, and I am going blind.11 My loved ones and friends stay away, fearing my disease. Even my own family stands at a distance.12 Meanwhile, my enemies lay traps for me; they make plans to ruin me. They think up treacherous deeds all day long.13 But I am deaf to all their threats. I am silent before them as one who cannot speak.14 I choose to hear nothing, and I make no reply.15 For I am waiting for you, O LORD. You must answer for me, O Lord my God.16 I prayed, "Don't let my enemies gloat over me or rejoice at my downfall."17 I am on the verge of collapse, facing constant pain.18 But I confess my sins; I am deeply sorry for what I have done.19 My enemies are many; they hate me though I have done nothing against them.20 They repay me evil for good and oppose me because I stand for the right.21 Do not abandon me, LORD. Do not stand at a distance, my God.22Come quickly to help me, O Lord my savior.
