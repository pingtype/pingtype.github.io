1  Keep me safe, O God, for I have come to you for refuge.2 I said to the LORD, "You are my Master! All the good things I have are from you."3 The godly people in the land are my true heroes! I take pleasure in them!4 Those who chase after other gods will be filled with sorrow. I will not take part in their sacrifices or even speak the names of their gods.5 LORD, you alone are my inheritance, my cup of blessing. You guard all that is mine.6 The land you have given me is a pleasant land. What a wonderful inheritance!7 I will bless the LORD who guides me; even at night my heart instructs me.8 I know the LORD is always with me. I will not be shaken, for he is right beside me.9 No wonder my heart is filled with joy, and my mouth[a] shouts his praises! My body rests in safety.10 For you will not leave my soul among the dead[b] or allow your godly one[c] to rot in the grave.11 You will show me the way of life, granting me the joy of your presence and the pleasures of living with you forever.
