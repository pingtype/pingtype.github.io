A prayer of David. 1 Bend down, O Lord , and hear my prayer; answer me, for I need your help.2 Protect me, for I am devoted to you. Save me, for I serve you and trust you. You are my God.3 Be merciful to me, O Lord, for I am calling on you constantly.4 Give me happiness, O Lord, for I give myself to you.5 O Lord, you are so good, so ready to forgive, so full of unfailing love for all who ask for your help.6 Listen closely to my prayer, O Lord ; hear my urgent cry.7 I will call to you whenever I'm in trouble, and you will answer me.8 No pagan god is like you, O Lord. None can do what you do!9 All the nations you made will come and bow before you, Lord; they will praise your holy name.10 For you are great and perform wonderful deeds. You alone are God.11 Teach me your ways, O Lord , that I may live according to your truth! Grant me purity of heart, so that I may honor you.12 With all my heart I will praise you, O Lord my God. I will give glory to your name forever,13 for your love for me is very great. You have rescued me from the depths of death.[a]14 O God, insolent people rise up against me; a violent gang is trying to kill me. You mean nothing to them.15 But you, O Lord, are a God of compassion and mercy, slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love and faithfulness.16 Look down and have mercy on me. Give your strength to your servant; save me, the son of your servant.17 Send me a sign of your favor. Then those who hate me will be put to shame, for you, O Lord , help and comfort me.       Footnotes:a.   86:13 Hebrew of Sheol.
