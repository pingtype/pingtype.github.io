1 I love the Lord  because he hears my voice and my prayer for mercy.2 Because he bends down to listen, I will pray as long as I have breath!3 Death wrapped its ropes around me; the terrors of the grave[a] overtook me. I saw only trouble and sorrow.4 Then I called on the name of the Lord : "Please, Lord , save me!"5 How kind the Lord  is! How good he is! So merciful, this God of ours!6 The Lord  protects those of childlike faith; I was facing death, and he saved me.7 Let my soul be at rest again, for the Lord  has been good to me.8 He has saved me from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling.9 And so I walk in the Lord 's presence as I live here on earth!10 I believed in you, so I said, "I am deeply troubled, Lord ."11 In my anxiety I cried out to you, "These people are all liars!"12 What can I offer the Lord  for all he has done for me?13 I will lift up the cup of salvation and praise the Lord 's name for saving me.14 I will keep my promises to the Lord  in the presence of all his people.15 The Lord  cares deeply when his loved ones die.16 O Lord , I am your servant; yes, I am your servant, born into your household; you have freed me from my chains.17 I will offer you a sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of the Lord .18 I will fulfill my vows to the Lord  in the presence of all his people-19 in the house of the Lord  in the heart of Jerusalem. Praise the Lord !       Footnotes:a.   116:3 Hebrew of Sheol.
