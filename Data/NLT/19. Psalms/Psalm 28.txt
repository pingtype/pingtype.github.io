1  O LORD, you are my rock of safety. Please help me; don't refuse to answer me. For if you are silent, I might as well give up and die.2 Listen to my prayer for mercy as I cry out to you for help, as I lift my hands toward your holy sanctuary.3 Don't drag me away with the wicked-- with those who do evil-- those who speak friendly words to their neighbors while planning evil in their hearts.4 Give them the punishment they so richly deserve! Measure it out in proportion to their wickedness. Pay them back for all their evil deeds! Give them a taste of what they have done to others.5 They care nothing for what the LORD has done or for what his hands have made. So he will tear them down like old buildings, and they will never be rebuilt!6 Praise the LORD! For he has heard my cry for mercy.7 The LORD is my strength, my shield from every danger. I trust in him with all my heart. He helps me, and my heart is filled with joy. I burst out in songs of thanksgiving.8 The LORD protects his people and gives victory to his anointed king.9 Save your people! Bless Israel, your special possession! Lead them like a shepherd, and carry them forever in your arms.
