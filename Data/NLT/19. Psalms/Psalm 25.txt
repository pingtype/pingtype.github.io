1  To you, O LORD, I lift up my soul.2 I trust in you, my God! Do not let me be disgraced, or let my enemies rejoice in my defeat.3 No one who trusts in you will ever be disgraced, but disgrace comes to those who try to deceive others.4 Show me the path where I should walk, O LORD; point out the right road for me to follow.5 Lead me by your truth and teach me, for you are the God who saves me. All day long I put my hope in you.6 Remember, O LORD, your unfailing love and compassion, which you have shown from long ages past.7 Forgive the rebellious sins of my youth; look instead through the eyes of your unfailing love, for you are merciful, O LORD.8 The LORD is good and does what is right; he shows the proper path to those who go astray.9 He leads the humble in what is right, teaching them his way.10 The LORD leads with unfailing love and faithfulness all those who keep his covenant and obey his decrees.11 For the honor of your name, O LORD, forgive my many, many sins.12 Who are those who fear the LORD? He will show them the path they should choose.13 They will live in prosperity, and their children will inherit the Promised Land.14 Friendship with the LORD is reserved for those who fear him. With them he shares the secrets of his covenant.15 My eyes are always looking to the LORD for help, for he alone can rescue me from the traps of my enemies.16 Turn to me and have mercy on me, for I am alone and in deep distress.17 My problems go from bad to worse. Oh, save me from them all!18 Feel my pain and see my trouble. Forgive all my sins.19 See how many enemies I have, and how viciously they hate me!20 Protect me! Rescue my life from them! Do not let me be disgraced, for I trust in you.21 May integrity and honesty protect me, for I put my hope in you.22 O God, ransom Israel from all its troubles.
