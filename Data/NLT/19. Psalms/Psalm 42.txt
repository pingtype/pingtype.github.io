1  As the deer pants for streams of water, so I long for you, O God.2 I thirst for God, the living God. When can I come and stand before him?3 Day and night, I have only tears for food, while my enemies continually taunt me, saying, "Where is this God of yours?"4 My heart is breaking as I remember how it used to be: I walked among the crowds of worshipers, leading a great procession to the house of God, singing for joy and giving thanks-- it was the sound of a great celebration!5 Why am I discouraged? Why so sad? I will put my hope in God! I will praise him again-- my Savior and  6my God! Now I am deeply discouraged, but I will remember your kindness-- from Mount Hermon, the source of the Jordan, from the land of Mount Mizar.7 I hear the tumult of the raging seas as your waves and surging tides sweep over me.8 Through each day the LORD pours his unfailing love upon me, and through each night I sing his songs, praying to God who gives me life.9 "O God my rock," I cry, "Why have you forsaken me? Why must I wander in darkness, oppressed by my enemies?"10 Their taunts pierce me like a fatal wound. They scoff, "Where is this God of yours?"11 Why am I discouraged? Why so sad? I will put my hope in God! I will praise him again-- my Savior and my God!
