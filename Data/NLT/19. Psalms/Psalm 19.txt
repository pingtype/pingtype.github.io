1  The heavens tell of the glory of God. The skies display his marvelous craftsmanship.2 Day after day they continue to speak; night after night they make him known.3 They speak without a sound or a word; their voice is silent in the skies;[a]4 yet their message has gone out to all the earth, and their words to all the world. The sun lives in the heavens where God placed it.5 It bursts forth like a radiant bridegroom after his wedding. It rejoices like a great athlete eager to run the race.6 The sun rises at one end of the heavens and follows its course to the other end. Nothing can hide from its heat.7 The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul. The decrees of the LORD are trustworthy, making wise the simple.8 The commandments of the LORD are right, bringing joy to the heart. The commands of the LORD are clear, giving insight to life.9 Reverence for the LORD is pure, lasting forever. The laws of the LORD are true; each one is fair.10 They are more desirable than gold, even the finest gold. They are sweeter than honey, even honey dripping from the comb.11 They are a warning to those who hear them; there is great reward for those who obey them.12 How can I know all the sins lurking in my heart? Cleanse me from these hidden faults.13 Keep me from deliberate sins! Don't let them control me. Then I will be free of guilt and innocent of great sin.14 May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be pleasing to you, O LORD, my rock and my redeemer.
