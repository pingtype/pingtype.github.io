1 Praise the Lord ! Yes, give praise, O servants of the Lord . Praise the name of the Lord !2 Blessed be the name of the Lord  now and forever.3 Everywhere-from east to west- praise the name of the Lord .4 For the Lord  is high above the nations; his glory is higher than the heavens.5 Who can be compared with the Lord  our God, who is enthroned on high?6 He stoops to look down on heaven and on earth.7 He lifts the poor from the dust and the needy from the garbage dump.8 He sets them among princes, even the princes of his own people!9 He gives the childless woman a family, making her a happy mother. Praise the Lord !
