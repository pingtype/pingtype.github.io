A song for pilgrims ascending to Jerusalem. 1 I took my troubles to the Lord ; I cried out to him, and he answered my prayer.2 Rescue me, O Lord , from liars and from all deceitful people.3 O deceptive tongue, what will God do to you? How will he increase your punishment?4 You will be pierced with sharp arrows and burned with glowing coals.5 How I suffer in far-off Meshech. It pains me to live in distant Kedar.6 I am tired of living among people who hate peace.7 I search for peace; but when I speak of peace, they want war!
