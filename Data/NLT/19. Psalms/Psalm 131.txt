1  LORD, my heart is not proud; my eyes are not haughty. I don't concern myself with matters too great or awesome for me.2 But I have stilled and quieted myself, just as a small child is quiet with its mother. Yes, like a small child is my soul within me.3 O Israel, put your hope in the LORD-- now and always.
