For the choir director: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by stringed instruments. 1 Answer me when I call to you, O God who declares me innocent. Free me from my troubles. Have mercy on me and hear my prayer.2 How long will you people ruin my reputation? How long will you make groundless accusations? How long will you continue your lies? Interlude3 You can be sure of this: The Lord  set apart the godly for himself. The Lord  will answer when I call to him.4 Don't sin by letting anger control you. Think about it overnight and remain silent. Interlude5 Offer sacrifices in the right spirit, and trust the Lord .6 Many people say, "Who will show us better times?" Let your face smile on us, Lord .7 You have given me greater joy than those who have abundant harvests of grain and new wine.8 In peace I will lie down and sleep, for you alone, O Lord , will keep me safe.
