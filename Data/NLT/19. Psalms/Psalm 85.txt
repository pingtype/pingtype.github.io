1  LORD, you have poured out amazing blessings on your land! You have restored the fortunes of Israel.[a]2 You have forgiven the guilt of your people-- yes, you have covered all their sins.3 You have withdrawn your fury. You have ended your blazing anger.4 Now turn to us again, O God of our salvation. Put aside your anger against us.5 Will you be angry with us always? Will you prolong your wrath to distant generations?6 Won't you revive us again, so your people can rejoice in you?7 Show us your unfailing love, O LORD, and grant us your salvation.8 I listen carefully to what God the LORD is saying, for he speaks peace to his people, his faithful ones. But let them not return to their foolish ways.9 Surely his salvation is near to those who honor him; our land will be filled with his glory.10 Unfailing love and truth have met together. Righteousness and peace have kissed!11 Truth springs up from the earth, and righteousness smiles down from heaven.12 Yes, the LORD pours down his blessings. Our land will yield its bountiful crops.13 Righteousness goes as a herald before him, preparing the way for his steps.
