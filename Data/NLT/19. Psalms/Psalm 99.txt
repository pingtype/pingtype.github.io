1  The LORD is king! Let the nations tremble! He sits on his throne between the cherubim. Let the whole earth quake!2 The LORD sits in majesty in Jerusalem,[a] supreme above all the nations.3 Let them praise your great and awesome name. Your name is holy!4 Mighty king, lover of justice, you have established fairness. You have acted with justice and righteousness throughout Israel.[b]5 Exalt the LORD our God! Bow low before his feet, for he is holy!6 Moses and Aaron were among his priests; Samuel also called on his name. They cried to the LORD for help, and he answered them.7 He spoke to them from the pillar of cloud, and they followed the decrees and principles he gave them.8 O LORD our God, you answered them. You were a forgiving God, but you punished them when they went wrong.9 Exalt the LORD our God and worship at his holy mountain in Jerusalem, for the LORD our God is holy!
