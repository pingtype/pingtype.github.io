1  Give honor to the LORD, you angels; give honor to the LORD for his glory and strength.2 Give honor to the LORD for the glory of his name. Worship the LORD in the splendor of his holiness.3 The voice of the LORD echoes above the sea. The God of glory thunders. The LORD thunders over the mighty sea.4 The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty.5 The voice of the LORD splits the mighty cedars; the LORD shatters the cedars of Lebanon.6 He makes Lebanon's mountains skip like a calf and Mount Hermon[a] to leap like a young bull.7 The voice of the LORD strikes with lightning bolts.8 The voice of the LORD makes the desert quake; the LORD shakes the desert of Kadesh.9 The voice of the LORD twists mighty oaks[b] and strips the forests bare. In his Temple everyone shouts, "Glory!"10 The LORD rules over the floodwaters. The LORD reigns as king forever.11 The LORD gives his people strength. The LORD blesses them with peace.
