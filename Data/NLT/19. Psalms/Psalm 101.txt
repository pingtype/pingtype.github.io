1  I will sing of your love and justice. I will praise you, LORD, with songs.2 I will be careful to live a blameless life-- when will you come to my aid? I will lead a life of integrity in my own home.3 I will refuse to look at anything vile and vulgar. I hate all crooked dealings; I will have nothing to do with them.4 I will reject perverse ideas and stay away from every evil.5 I will not tolerate people who slander their neighbors. I will not endure conceit and pride.6 I will keep a protective eye on the godly, so they may dwell with me in safety. Only those who are above reproach will be allowed to serve me.7 I will not allow deceivers to serve me, and liars will not be allowed to enter my presence.8 My daily task will be to ferret out criminals and free the city of the LORD from their grip.
