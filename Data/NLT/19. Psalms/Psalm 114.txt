1  When the Israelites escaped from Egypt-- when the family of Jacob left that foreign land--2 the land of Judah became God's sanctuary, and Israel became his kingdom.3 The Red Sea[a] saw them coming and hurried out of their way! The water of the Jordan River turned away.4 The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like lambs!5 What's wrong, Red Sea, that made you hurry out of their way? What happened, Jordan River, that you turned away?6 Why, mountains, did you skip like rams? Why, little hills, like lambs?7 Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Israel.[b]8 He turned the rock into pools of water; yes, springs of water came from solid rock.
