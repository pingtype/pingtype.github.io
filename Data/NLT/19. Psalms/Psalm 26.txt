1  Declare me innocent, O LORD, for I have acted with integrity; I have trusted in the LORD without wavering.2 Put me on trial, LORD, and cross-examine me. Test my motives and affections.3 For I am constantly aware of your unfailing love, and I have lived according to your truth.4 I do not spend time with liars or go along with hypocrites.5 I hate the gatherings of those who do evil, and I refuse to join in with the wicked.6 I wash my hands to declare my innocence. I come to your altar, O LORD,7 singing a song of thanksgiving and telling of all your miracles.8 I love your sanctuary, LORD, the place where your glory shines.9 Don't let me suffer the fate of sinners. Don't condemn me along with murderers.10 Their hands are dirty with wicked schemes, and they constantly take bribes.11 But I am not like that; I do what is right. So in your mercy, save me.12 I have taken a stand, and I will publicly praise the LORD.
