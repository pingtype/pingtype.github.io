1  Shout joyful praises to God, all the earth!2 Sing about the glory of his name! Tell the world how glorious he is.3 Say to God, "How awesome are your deeds! Your enemies cringe before your mighty power.4 Everything on earth will worship you; they will sing your praises, shouting your name in glorious songs."5 Come and see what our God has done, what awesome miracles he does for his people!6 He made a dry path through the Red Sea,[a] and his people went across on foot. Come, let us rejoice in who he is.7 For by his great power he rules forever. He watches every movement of the nations; let no rebel rise in defiance.8 Let the whole world bless our God and sing aloud his praises.9 Our lives are in his hands, and he keeps our feet from stumbling.10 You have tested us, O God; you have purified us like silver melted in a crucible.11 You captured us in your net and laid the burden of slavery on our backs.12 You sent troops to ride across our broken bodies. We went through fire and flood. But you brought us to a place of great abundance.13 Now I come to your Temple with burnt offerings to fulfill the vows I made to you--14 yes, the sacred vows you heard me make when I was in deep trouble.15 That is why I am sacrificing burnt offerings to you-- the best of my rams as a pleasing aroma. And I will sacrifice bulls and goats.16 Come and listen, all you who fear God, and I will tell you what he did for me.17 For I cried out to him for help, praising him as I spoke.18 If I had not confessed the sin in my heart, my Lord would not have listened.19 But God did listen! He paid attention to my prayer.20 Praise God, who did not ignore my prayer and did not withdraw his unfailing love from me.
