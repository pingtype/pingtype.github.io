1  Those who live in the shelter of the Most High will find rest in the shadow of the Almighty.2 This I declare of the LORD: He alone is my refuge, my place of safety; he is my God, and I am trusting him.3 For he will rescue you from every trap and protect you from the fatal plague.4 He will shield you with his wings. He will shelter you with his feathers. His faithful promises are your armor and protection.5 Do not be afraid of the terrors of the night, nor fear the dangers of the day,6 nor dread the plague that stalks in darkness, nor the disaster that strikes at midday.7 Though a thousand fall at your side, though ten thousand are dying around you, these evils will not touch you.8 But you will see it with your eyes; you will see how the wicked are punished.9 If you make the LORD your refuge, if you make the Most High your shelter,10 no evil will conquer you; no plague will come near your dwelling.11 For he orders his angels to protect you wherever you go.12 They will hold you with their hands to keep you from striking your foot on a stone.13 You will trample down lions and poisonous snakes; you will crush fierce lions and serpents under your feet!14 The LORD says, "I will rescue those who love me. I will protect those who trust in my name.15 When they call on me, I will answer; I will be with them in trouble. I will rescue them and honor them.16 I will satisfy them with a long life and give them my salvation."
