A psalm of Asaph. 1 God presides over heaven's court; he pronounces judgment on the heavenly beings:
2 "How long will you hand down unjust decisions by favoring the wicked? Interlude
3 "Give justice to the poor and the orphan; uphold the rights of the oppressed and the destitute.
4 Rescue the poor and helpless; deliver them from the grasp of evil people.
5 But these oppressors know nothing; they are so ignorant! They wander about in darkness, while the whole world is shaken to the core.
6 I say, "You are gods; you are all children of the Most High.
7 But you will die like mere mortals and fall like every other ruler.'"
8 Rise up, O God, and judge the earth, for all the nations belong to you.
