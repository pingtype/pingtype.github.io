1  O LORD, hear me as I pray; pay attention to my groaning.
2 Listen to my cry for help, my King and my God, for I will never pray to anyone but you.
3 Listen to my voice in the morning, LORD. Each morning I bring my requests to you and wait expectantly.
4 O God, you take no pleasure in wickedness; you cannot tolerate the slightest sin.
5 Therefore, the proud will not be allowed to stand in your presence, for you hate all who do evil.
6 You will destroy those who tell lies. The LORD detests murderers and deceivers.
7 Because of your unfailing love, I can enter your house; with deepest awe I will worship at your Temple.
8 Lead me in the right path, O LORD, or my enemies will conquer me. Tell me clearly what to do, and show me which way to turn.
9 My enemies cannot speak one truthful word. Their deepest desire is to destroy others. Their talk is foul, like the stench from an open grave. Their speech is filled with flattery.
10 O God, declare them guilty. Let them be caught in their own traps. Drive them away because of their many sins, for they rebel against you.
11 But let all who take refuge in you rejoice; let them sing joyful praises forever. Protect them, so all who love your name may be filled with joy.
12 For you bless the godly, O LORD, surrounding them with your shield of love.
