A psalm of thanksgiving. 1 Shout with joy to the Lord , all the earth!2 Worship the Lord  with gladness. Come before him, singing with joy.3 Acknowledge that the Lord  is God! He made us, and we are his.[a]We are his people, the sheep of his pasture.4 Enter his gates with thanksgiving; go into his courts with praise. Give thanks to him and praise his name.5 For the Lord  is good. His unfailing love continues forever, and his faithfulness continues to each generation.       Footnotes:a.   100:3 As in an alternate reading in the Masoretic Text; the other alternate and some ancient versions read and not we ourselves.
