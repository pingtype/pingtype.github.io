1  Come with great power, O God, and rescue me! Defend me with your might.2 O God, listen to my prayer. Pay attention to my plea.3 For strangers are attacking me; violent men are trying to kill me. They care nothing for God.4 But God is my helper. The Lord is the one who keeps me alive!5 May my enemies' plans for evil be turned against them. Do as you promised and put an end to them.6 I will sacrifice a voluntary offering to you; I will praise your name, O LORD, for it is good.7 For you will rescue me from my troubles and help me to triumph over my enemies.
