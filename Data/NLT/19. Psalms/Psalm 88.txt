1  O LORD, God of my salvation, I have cried out to you day and night.2 Now hear my prayer; listen to my cry.3 For my life is full of troubles, and death draws near.4 I have been dismissed as one who is dead, like a strong man with no strength left.5 They have abandoned me to death, and I am as good as dead. I am forgotten, cut off from your care.6 You have thrust me down to the lowest pit, into the darkest depths.7 Your anger lies heavy on me; wave after wave engulfs me.8 You have caused my friends to loathe me; you have sent them all away. I am in a trap with no way of escape.9 My eyes are blinded by my tears. Each day I beg for your help, O LORD; I lift my pleading hands to you for mercy.10 Of what use to the dead are your miracles? Do the dead get up and praise you?11 Can those in the grave declare your unfailing love? In the place of destruction, can they proclaim your faithfulness?12 Can the darkness speak of your miracles? Can anyone in the land of forgetfulness talk about your righteousness?13 O LORD, I cry out to you. I will keep on pleading day by day.14 O LORD, why do you reject me? Why do you turn your face away from me?15 I have been sickly and close to death since my youth. I stand helpless and desperate before your terrors.16 Your fierce anger has overwhelmed me. Your terrors have cut me off.17 They swirl around me like floodwaters all day long. They have encircled me completely.18 You have taken away my companions and loved ones; only darkness remains.
