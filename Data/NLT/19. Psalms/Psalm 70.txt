1  Please, God, rescue me! Come quickly, LORD, and help me.2 May those who try to destroy me be humiliated and put to shame. May those who take delight in my trouble be turned back in disgrace.3 Let them be horrified by their shame, for they said, "Aha! We've got him now!"4 But may all who search for you be filled with joy and gladness. May those who love your salvation repeatedly shout, "God is great!"5 But I am poor and needy; please hurry to my aid, O God. You are my helper and my savior; O LORD, do not delay!
