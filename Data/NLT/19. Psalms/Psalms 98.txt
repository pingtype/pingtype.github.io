A psalm. 1 Sing a new song to the Lord , for he has done wonderful deeds. His right hand has won a mighty victory; his holy arm has shown his saving power!2 The Lord  has announced his victory and has revealed his righteousness to every nation!3 He has remembered his promise to love and be faithful to Israel. The ends of the earth have seen the victory of our God.4 Shout to the Lord , all the earth; break out in praise and sing for joy!5 Sing your praise to the Lord  with the harp, with the harp and melodious song,6 with trumpets and the sound of the ram's horn. Make a joyful symphony before the Lord , the King!7 Let the sea and everything in it shout his praise! Let the earth and all living things join in.8 Let the rivers clap their hands in glee! Let the hills sing out their songs of joy9 before the Lord , for he is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world with justice, and the nations with fairness.
