For the choir director: A psalm[a] of David, regarding the time Doeg the Edomite said to Saul, "David has gone to see Ahimelech." 1 Why do you boast about your crimes, great warrior? Don't you realize God's justice continues forever?2 All day long you plot destruction. Your tongue cuts like a sharp razor; you're an expert at telling lies.3 You love evil more than good and lies more than truth. Interlude4 You love to destroy others with your words, you liar!5 But God will strike you down once and for all. He will pull you from your home and uproot you from the land of the living. Interlude6 The righteous will see it and be amazed. They will laugh and say,7 "Look what happens to mighty warriors who do not trust in God. They trust their wealth instead and grow more and more bold in their wickedness."8 But I am like an olive tree, thriving in the house of God. I will always trust in God's unfailing love.9 I will praise you forever, O God, for what you have done. I will trust in your good name in the presence of your faithful people.       Footnotes:a.   52:TITLE  Hebrew maskil. This may be a literary or musical term.
