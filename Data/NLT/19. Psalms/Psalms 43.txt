1 Declare me innocent, O God! Defend me against these ungodly people. Rescue me from these unjust liars.2 For you are God, my only safe haven. Why have you tossed me aside? Why must I wander around in grief, oppressed by my enemies?3 Send out your light and your truth; let them guide me. Let them lead me to your holy mountain, to the place where you live.4 There I will go to the altar of God, to God-the source of all my joy. I will praise you with my harp, O God, my God!5 Why am I discouraged? Why is my heart so sad? I will put my hope in God! I will praise him again- my Savior and my God!
