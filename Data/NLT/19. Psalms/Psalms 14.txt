For the choir director: A psalm of David. 1 Only fools say in their hearts, "There is no God." They are corrupt, and their actions are evil; not one of them does good!2 The Lord  looks down from heaven on the entire human race; he looks to see if anyone is truly wise, if anyone seeks God.3 But no, all have turned away; all have become corrupt.[a]No one does good, not a single one!4 Will those who do evil never learn? They eat up my people like bread and wouldn't think of praying to the Lord .5 Terror will grip them, for God is with those who obey him.6 The wicked frustrate the plans of the oppressed, but the Lord  will protect his people.7 Who will come from Mount Zion to rescue Israel? When the Lord  restores his people, Jacob will shout with joy, and Israel will rejoice.       Footnotes:a.   14:3 Greek version reads have become useless. Compare Rom 3:12.
