1  It is good to give thanks to the LORD, to sing praises to the Most High.2 It is good to proclaim your unfailing love in the morning, your faithfulness in the evening,3 accompanied by the harp and lute and the harmony of the lyre.4 You thrill me, LORD, with all you have done for me! I sing for joy because of what you have done.5 O LORD, what great miracles you do! And how deep are your thoughts.6 Only an ignorant person would not know this! Only a fool would not understand it.7 Although the wicked flourish like weeds, and evildoers blossom with success, there is only eternal destruction ahead of them.8 But you are exalted in the heavens. You, O LORD, continue forever.9 Your enemies, LORD, will surely perish; all evildoers will be scattered.10 But you have made me as strong as a wild bull. How refreshed I am by your power!11 With my own eyes I have seen the downfall of my enemies; with my own ears I have heard the defeat of my wicked opponents.12 But the godly will flourish like palm trees and grow strong like the cedars of Lebanon.13 For they are transplanted into the LORD's own house. They flourish in the courts of our God.14 Even in old age they will still produce fruit; they will remain vital and green.15 They will declare, "The LORD is just! He is my rock! There is nothing but goodness in him!"
