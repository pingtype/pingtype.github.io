For Jeduthun, the choir director: A psalm of David. 1 I wait quietly before God, for my victory comes from him.2 He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress where I will never be shaken.3 So many enemies against one man- all of them trying to kill me. To them I'm just a broken-down wall or a tottering fence.4 They plan to topple me from my high position. They delight in telling lies about me. They praise me to my face but curse me in their hearts. Interlude5 Let all that I am wait quietly before God, for my hope is in him.6 He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress where I will not be shaken.7 My victory and honor come from God alone. He is my refuge, a rock where no enemy can reach me.8 O my people, trust in him at all times. Pour out your heart to him, for God is our refuge. Interlude9 Common people are as worthless as a puff of wind, and the powerful are not what they appear to be. If you weigh them on the scales, together they are lighter than a breath of air.10 Don't make your living by extortion or put your hope in stealing. And if your wealth increases, don't make it the center of your life.11 God has spoken plainly, and I have heard it many times: Power, O God, belongs to you;12 unfailing love, O Lord, is yours. Surely you repay all people according to what they have done.
