1  Praise the LORD! Praise the LORD from the heavens! Praise him from the skies!2 Praise him, all his angels! Praise him, all the armies of heaven!3 Praise him, sun and moon! Praise him, all you twinkling stars!4 Praise him, skies above! Praise him, vapors high above the clouds!5 Let every created thing give praise to the LORD, for he issued his command, and they came into being.6 He established them forever and forever. His orders will never be revoked.7 Praise the LORD from the earth, you creatures of the ocean depths,8 fire and hail, snow and storm, wind and weather that obey him,9 mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars,10 wild animals and all livestock, reptiles and birds,11 kings of the earth and all people, rulers and judges of the earth,12 young men and maidens, old men and children.13 Let them all praise the name of the LORD. For his name is very great; his glory towers over the earth and heaven!14 He has made his people strong, honoring his godly ones-- the people of Israel who are close to him. Praise the LORD!
