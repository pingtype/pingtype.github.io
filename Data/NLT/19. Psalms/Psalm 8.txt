1[a]  O LORD, our Lord, the majesty of your name fills the earth! Your glory is higher than the heavens.2 You have taught children and nursing infants to give you praise.[b] They silence your enemies who were seeking revenge.3 When I look at the night sky and see the work of your fingers-- the moon and the stars you have set in place--4 what are mortals that you should think of us, mere humans that you should care for us?[c]5 For you made us only a little lower than God,[d] and you crowned us with glory and honor.6 You put us in charge of everything you made, giving us authority over all things--7 the sheep and the cattle and all the wild animals,8 the birds in the sky, the fish in the sea, and everything that swims the ocean currents.9 O LORD, our Lord, the majesty of your name fills the earth!
