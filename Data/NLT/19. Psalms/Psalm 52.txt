1  You call yourself a hero, do you? Why boast about this crime of yours, you who have disgraced God's people?2 All day long you plot destruction. Your tongue cuts like a sharp razor; you're an expert at telling lies.3 You love evil more than good and lies more than truth.4 You love to say things that harm others, you liar!5 But God will strike you down once and for all. He will pull you from your home and drag you from the land of the living.6 The righteous will see it and be amazed. They will laugh and say,7 "Look what happens to mighty warriors who do not trust in God. They trust their wealth instead and grow more and more bold in their wickedness."8 But I am like an olive tree, thriving in the house of God. I trust in God's unfailing love forever and ever.9 I will praise you forever, O God, for what you have done. I will wait for your mercies in the presence of your people.
