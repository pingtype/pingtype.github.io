A psalm[a] of David. 1 Oh, what joy for those whose disobedience is forgiven, whose sin is put out of sight!2 Yes, what joy for those whose record the Lord  has cleared of guilt,[b]whose lives are lived in complete honesty!3 When I refused to confess my sin, my body wasted away, and I groaned all day long.4 Day and night your hand of discipline was heavy on me. My strength evaporated like water in the summer heat. Interlude5 Finally, I confessed all my sins to you and stopped trying to hide my guilt. I said to myself, "I will confess my rebellion to the Lord ." And you forgave me! All my guilt is gone. Interlude6 Therefore, let all the godly pray to you while there is still time, that they may not drown in the floodwaters of judgment.7 For you are my hiding place; you protect me from trouble. You surround me with songs of victory. Interlude8 The Lord  says, "I will guide you along the best pathway for your life. I will advise you and watch over you.9 Do not be like a senseless horse or mule that needs a bit and bridle to keep it under control."10 Many sorrows come to the wicked, but unfailing love surrounds those who trust the Lord .11 So rejoice in the Lord  and be glad, all you who obey him! Shout for joy, all you whose hearts are pure!       Footnotes:a.   32:TITLE  Hebrew maskil. This may be a literary or musical term.  b.   32:2 Greek version reads of sin. Compare Rom 4:8.
