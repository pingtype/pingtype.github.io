1  Lord, through all the generations you have been our home!2 Before the mountains were created, before you made the earth and the world, you are God, without beginning or end.3 You turn people back to dust, saying, "Return to dust!"4 For you, a thousand years are as yesterday! They are like a few hours!5 You sweep people away like dreams that disappear or like grass that springs up in the morning.6 In the morning it blooms and flourishes, but by evening it is dry and withered.7 We wither beneath your anger; we are overwhelmed by your fury.8 You spread out our sins before you-- our secret sins--and you see them all.9 We live our lives beneath your wrath. We end our lives with a groan.10 Seventy years are given to us! Some may even reach eighty. But even the best of these years are filled with pain and trouble; soon they disappear, and we are gone.11 Who can comprehend the power of your anger? Your wrath is as awesome as the fear you deserve.12 Teach us to make the most of our time, so that we may grow in wisdom.13 O LORD, come back to us! How long will you delay? Take pity on your servants!14 Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love, so we may sing for joy to the end of our lives.15 Give us gladness in proportion to our former misery! Replace the evil years with good.16 Let us see your miracles again; let our children see your glory at work.17 And may the Lord our God show us his approval and make our efforts successful. Yes, make our efforts successful!
