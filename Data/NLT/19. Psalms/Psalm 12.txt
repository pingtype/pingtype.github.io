1[a]  Help, O LORD, for the godly are fast disappearing! The faithful have vanished from the earth!2 Neighbors lie to each other, speaking with flattering lips and insincere hearts.3 May the LORD bring their flattery to an end and silence their proud tongues.4 They say, "We will lie to our hearts' content. Our lips are our own--who can stop us?"5 The LORD replies, "I have seen violence done to the helpless, and I have heard the groans of the poor. Now I will rise up to rescue them, as they have longed for me to do."6 The LORD's promises are pure, like silver refined in a furnace, purified seven times over.7 Therefore, LORD, we know you will protect the oppressed, preserving them forever from this lying generation,8 even though the wicked strut about, and evil is praised throughout the land.
