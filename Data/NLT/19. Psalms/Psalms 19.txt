For the choir director: A psalm of David. 1 The heavens proclaim the glory of God. The skies display his craftsmanship.2 Day after day they continue to speak; night after night they make him known.3 They speak without a sound or word; their voice is never heard.[a]4 Yet their message has gone throughout the earth, and their words to all the world. God has made a home in the heavens for the sun.5 It bursts forth like a radiant bridegroom after his wedding. It rejoices like a great athlete eager to run the race.6 The sun rises at one end of the heavens and follows its course to the other end. Nothing can hide from its heat.7 The instructions of the Lord  are perfect, reviving the soul. The decrees of the Lord  are trustworthy, making wise the simple.8 The commandments of the Lord  are right, bringing joy to the heart. The commands of the Lord  are clear, giving insight for living.9 Reverence for the Lord  is pure, lasting forever. The laws of the Lord  are true; each one is fair.10 They are more desirable than gold, even the finest gold. They are sweeter than honey, even honey dripping from the comb.11 They are a warning to your servant, a great reward for those who obey them.12 How can I know all the sins lurking in my heart? Cleanse me from these hidden faults.13 Keep your servant from deliberate sins! Don't let them control me. Then I will be free of guilt and innocent of great sin.14 May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing to you, O Lord , my rock and my redeemer.       Footnotes:a.   19:3 Or There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard.
