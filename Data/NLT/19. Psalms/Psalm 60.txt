1  You have rejected us, O God, and broken our defenses. You have been angry with us; now restore us to your favor.2 You have shaken our land and split it open. Seal the cracks before it completely collapses.3 You have been very hard on us, making us drink wine that sent us reeling.4 But you have raised a banner for those who honor you-- a rallying point in the face of attack.5 Use your strong right arm to save us, and rescue your beloved people.6 God has promised this by his holiness[a]: "I will divide up Shechem with joy. I will measure out the valley of Succoth.7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine. Ephraim will produce my warriors, and Judah will produce my kings.8 Moab will become my lowly servant, and Edom will be my slave. I will shout in triumph over the Philistines."9 But who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will bring me victory over Edom?10 Have you rejected us, O God? Will you no longer march with our armies?11 Oh, please help us against our enemies, for all human help is useless.12 With God's help we will do mighty things, for he will trample down our foes.
