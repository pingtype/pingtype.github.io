1  When the LORD restored his exiles to Jerusalem,[a] it was like a dream!2 We were filled with laughter, and we sang for joy. And the other nations said, "What amazing things the LORD has done for them."3 Yes, the LORD has done amazing things for us! What joy!4 Restore our fortunes, LORD, as streams renew the desert.5 Those who plant in tears will harvest with shouts of joy.6 They weep as they go to plant their seed, but they sing as they return with the harvest.
