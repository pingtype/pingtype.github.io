1  O God, have mercy on me. The enemy troops press in on me. My foes attack me all day long.2 My slanderers hound me constantly, and many are boldly attacking me.3 But when I am afraid, I put my trust in you.4 O God, I praise your word. I trust in God, so why should I be afraid? What can mere mortals do to me?5 They are always twisting what I say; they spend their days plotting ways to harm me.6 They come together to spy on me-- watching my every step, eager to kill me.7 Don't let them get away with their wickedness; in your anger, O God, throw them to the ground.8 You keep track of all my sorrows. You have collected all my tears in your bottle. You have recorded each one in your book.9 On the very day I call to you for help, my enemies will retreat. This I know: God is on my side.[a]10 O God, I praise your word. Yes, LORD, I praise your word.11 I trust in God, so why should I be afraid? What can mere mortals do to me?12 I will fulfill my vows to you, O God, and offer a sacrifice of thanks for your help.13 For you have rescued me from death; you have kept my feet from slipping. So now I can walk in your presence, O God, in your life-giving light.
