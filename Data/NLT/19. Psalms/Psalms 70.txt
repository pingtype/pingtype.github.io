For the choir director: A psalm of David, asking God to remember him. 1 Please, God, rescue me! Come quickly, Lord , and help me.2 May those who try to kill me be humiliated and put to shame. May those who take delight in my trouble be turned back in disgrace.3 Let them be horrified by their shame, for they said, "Aha! We've got him now!"4 But may all who search for you be filled with joy and gladness in you. May those who love your salvation repeatedly shout, "God is great!"5 But as for me, I am poor and needy; please hurry to my aid, O God. You are my helper and my savior; O Lord , do not delay.
