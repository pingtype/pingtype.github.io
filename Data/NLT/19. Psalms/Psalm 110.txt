1  The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit in honor at my right hand until I humble your enemies, making them a footstool under your feet."2 The LORD will extend your powerful dominion from Jerusalem[a]; you will rule over your enemies.3 In that day of battle, your people will serve you willingly. Arrayed in holy garments, your vigor will be renewed each day like the morning dew.4 The LORD has taken an oath and will not break his vow: "You are a priest forever in the line of Melchizedek."5 The Lord stands at your right hand to protect you. He will strike down many kings in the day of his anger.6 He will punish the nations and fill them with their dead; he will shatter heads over the whole earth.7 But he himself will be refreshed from brooks along the way. He will be victorious.
