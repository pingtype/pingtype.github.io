A psalm of David. 1 Honor the Lord , you heavenly beings*; honor the Lord  for his glory and strength.
2 Honor the Lord  for the glory of his name. Worship the Lord  in the splendor of his holiness.
3 The voice of the Lord  echoes above the sea. The God of glory thunders. The Lord  thunders over the mighty sea.
4 The voice of the Lord  is powerful; the voice of the Lord  is majestic.
5 The voice of the Lord  splits the mighty cedars; the Lord  shatters the cedars of Lebanon.
6 He makes Lebanon's mountains skip like a calf; he makes Mount Hermon* leap like a young wild ox.
7 The voice of the Lord  strikes with bolts of lightning.
8 The voice of the Lord  makes the barren wilderness quake; the Lord  shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.
9 The voice of the Lord  twists mighty oaks*and strips the forests bare. In his Temple everyone shouts, "Glory!"
10 The Lord  rules over the floodwaters. The Lord  reigns as king forever.
11 The Lord  gives his people strength. The Lord  blesses them with peace.
