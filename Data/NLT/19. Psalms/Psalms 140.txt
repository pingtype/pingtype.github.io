For the choir director: A psalm of David. 1 O Lord , rescue me from evil people. Protect me from those who are violent,
2 those who plot evil in their hearts and stir up trouble all day long.
3 Their tongues sting like a snake; the venom of a viper drips from their lips. Interlude
4 O Lord , keep me out of the hands of the wicked. Protect me from those who are violent, for they are plotting against me.
5 The proud have set a trap to catch me; they have stretched out a net; they have placed traps all along the way. Interlude
6 I said to the Lord , "You are my God!" Listen, O Lord , to my cries for mercy!
7 O Sovereign Lord , the strong one who rescued me, you protected me on the day of battle.
8 Lord , do not let evil people have their way. Do not let their evil schemes succeed, or they will become proud. Interlude
9 Let my enemies be destroyed by the very evil they have planned for me.
10 Let burning coals fall down on their heads. Let them be thrown into the fire or into watery pits from which they can't escape.
11 Don't let liars prosper here in our land. Cause great disasters to fall on the violent.
12 But I know the Lord  will help those they persecute; he will give justice to the poor.
13 Surely righteous people are praising your name; the godly will live in your presence.
