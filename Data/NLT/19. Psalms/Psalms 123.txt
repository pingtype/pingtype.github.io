A song for pilgrims ascending to Jerusalem. 1 I lift my eyes to you, O God, enthroned in heaven.2 We keep looking to the Lord  our God for his mercy, just as servants keep their eyes on their master, as a slave girl watches her mistress for the slightest signal.3 Have mercy on us, Lord , have mercy, for we have had our fill of contempt.4 We have had more than our fill of the scoffing of the proud and the contempt of the arrogant.
