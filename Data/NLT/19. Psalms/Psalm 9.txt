1  I will thank you, LORD, with all my heart; I will tell of all the marvelous things you have done.2 I will be filled with joy because of you. I will sing praises to your name, O Most High.3 My enemies turn away in retreat; they are overthrown and destroyed before you.4 For you have judged in my favor; from your throne, you have judged with fairness.5 You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked; you have wiped out their names forever.6 My enemies have met their doom; their cities are perpetual ruins. Even the memory of their uprooted cities is lost.7 But the LORD reigns forever, executing judgment from his throne.8 He will judge the world with justice and rule the nations with fairness.9 The LORD is a shelter for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.10 Those who know your name trust in you, for you, O LORD, have never abandoned anyone who searches for you.11 Sing praises to the LORD who reigns in Jerusalem.[a] Tell the world about his unforgettable deeds.12 For he who avenges murder cares for the helpless. He does not ignore those who cry to him for help.13 LORD, have mercy on me. See how I suffer at the hands of those who hate me. Snatch me back from the jaws of death.14 Save me, so I can praise you publicly at Jerusalem's gates, so I can rejoice that you have rescued me.15 The nations have fallen into the pit they dug for others. They have been caught in their own trap.16 The LORD is known for his justice. The wicked have trapped themselves in their own snares.[b] 17 The wicked will go down to the grave.[c] This is the fate of all the nations who ignore God.18 For the needy will not be forgotten forever; the hopes of the poor will not always be crushed.19 Arise, O LORD! Do not let mere mortals defy you! Let the nations be judged in your presence!20 Make them tremble in fear, O LORD. Let them know they are merely human.
