1  Praise the LORD! Praise the name of the LORD! Praise him, you who serve the LORD,2 you who serve in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God.3 Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good; celebrate his wonderful name with music.4 For the LORD has chosen Jacob for himself, Israel for his own special treasure.5 I know the greatness of the LORD-- that our Lord is greater than any other god.6 The LORD does whatever pleases him throughout all heaven and earth, and on the seas and in their depths.7 He causes the clouds to rise over the earth. He sends the lightning with the rain and releases the wind from his storehouses.8 He destroyed the firstborn in each Egyptian home, both people and animals.9 He performed miraculous signs and wonders in Egypt; Pharaoh and all his people watched.10 He struck down great nations and slaughtered mighty kings--11 Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all the kings of Canaan.12 He gave their land as an inheritance, a special possession to his people Israel.13 Your name, O LORD, endures forever; your fame, O LORD, is known to every generation.14 For the LORD will vindicate his people and have compassion on his servants.15 Their idols are merely things of silver and gold, shaped by human hands.16 They cannot talk, though they have mouths, or see, though they have eyes!17 They cannot hear with their ears or smell with their noses.18 And those who make them are just like them, as are all who trust in them.19 O Israel, praise the LORD! O priests of Aaron, praise the LORD!20 O Levites, praise the LORD! All you who fear the LORD, praise the LORD!21 The LORD be praised from Zion, for he lives here in Jerusalem. Praise the LORD!
