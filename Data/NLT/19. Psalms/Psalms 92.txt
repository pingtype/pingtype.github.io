A psalm. A song to be sung on the Sabbath Day. 1 It is good to give thanks to the Lord , to sing praises to the Most High.
2 It is good to proclaim your unfailing love in the morning, your faithfulness in the evening,
3 accompanied by a ten-stringed instrument, a harp, and the melody of a lyre.
4 You thrill me, Lord , with all you have done for me! I sing for joy because of what you have done.
5 O Lord , what great works you do! And how deep are your thoughts.
6 Only a simpleton would not know, and only a fool would not understand this:
7 Though the wicked sprout like weeds and evildoers flourish, they will be destroyed forever.
8 But you, O Lord , will be exalted forever.
9 Your enemies, Lord , will surely perish; all evildoers will be scattered.
10 But you have made me as strong as a wild ox. You have anointed me with the finest oil.
11 My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies; my ears have heard the defeat of my wicked opponents.
12 But the godly will flourish like palm trees and grow strong like the cedars of Lebanon.
13 For they are transplanted to the Lord 's own house. They flourish in the courts of our God.
14 Even in old age they will still produce fruit; they will remain vital and green.
15 They will declare, "The Lord  is just! He is my rock! There is no evil in him!"
