1  From my earliest youth my enemies have persecuted me-- let Israel now say--2 from my earliest youth my enemies have persecuted me, but they have never been able to finish me off.3 My back is covered with cuts, as if a farmer had plowed long furrows.4 But the LORD is good; he has cut the cords used by the ungodly to bind me.5 May all who hate Jerusalem[a] be turned back in shameful defeat.6 May they be as useless as grass on a rooftop, turning yellow when only half grown,7 ignored by the harvester, despised by the binder.8 And may those who pass by refuse to give them this blessing: "The LORD's blessings be upon you; we bless you in the LORD's name."
