1 Come, let us sing to the Lord ! Let us shout joyfully to the Rock of our salvation.2 Let us come to him with thanksgiving. Let us sing psalms of praise to him.3 For the Lord  is a great God, a great King above all gods.4 He holds in his hands the depths of the earth and the mightiest mountains.5 The sea belongs to him, for he made it. His hands formed the dry land, too.6 Come, let us worship and bow down. Let us kneel before the Lord  our maker,7 for he is our God. We are the people he watches over, the flock under his care. If only you would listen to his voice today!8 The Lord  says, "Don't harden your hearts as Israel did at Meribah, as they did at Massah in the wilderness.9 For there your ancestors tested and tried my patience, even though they saw everything I did.10 For forty years I was angry with them, and I said, "They are a people whose hearts turn away from me. They refuse to do what I tell them.'11 So in my anger I took an oath: "They will never enter my place of rest.'"       Footnotes:
