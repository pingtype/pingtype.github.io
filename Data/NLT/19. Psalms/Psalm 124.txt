1  If the LORD had not been on our side-- let Israel now say--2 if the LORD had not been on our side when people rose up against us,3 they would have swallowed us alive because of their burning anger against us.4 The waters would have engulfed us; a torrent would have overwhelmed us.5 Yes, the raging waters of their fury would have overwhelmed our very lives.6 Blessed be the LORD, who did not let their teeth tear us apart!7 We escaped like a bird from a hunter's trap. The trap is broken, and we are free!8 Our help is from the LORD, who made the heavens and the earth.
