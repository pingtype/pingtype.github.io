A psalm of David. A song for the dedication of the Temple. 1 I will exalt you, Lord , for you rescued me. You refused to let my enemies triumph over me.
2 O Lord  my God, I cried to you for help, and you restored my health.
3 You brought me up from the grave,* O Lord . You kept me from falling into the pit of death.
4 Sing to the Lord , all you godly ones! Praise his holy name.
5 For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime! Weeping may last through the night, but joy comes with the morning.
6 When I was prosperous, I said, "Nothing can stop me now!"
7 Your favor, O Lord , made me as secure as a mountain. Then you turned away from me, and I was shattered.
8 I cried out to you, O Lord . I begged the Lord for mercy, saying,
9 "What will you gain if I die, if I sink into the grave? Can my dust praise you? Can it tell of your faithfulness?
10 Hear me, Lord , and have mercy on me. Help me, O Lord ."
11 You have turned my mourning into joyful dancing. You have taken away my clothes of mourning and clothed me with joy,
12 that I might sing praises to you and not be silent. O Lord  my God, I will give you thanks forever!
