1  O LORD, rescue me from evil people. Preserve me from those who are violent,2 those who plot evil in their hearts and stir up trouble all day long.3 Their tongues sting like a snake; the poison of a viper drips from their lips.4 O LORD, keep me out of the hands of the wicked. Preserve me from those who are violent, for they are plotting against me.5 The proud have set a trap to catch me; they have stretched out a net; they have placed traps all along the way.6 I said to the LORD, "You are my God!" Listen, O LORD, to my cries for mercy!7 O Sovereign LORD, my strong savior, you protected me on the day of battle.8 LORD, do not give in to their evil desires. Do not let their evil schemes succeed, O God.9 Let my enemies be destroyed by the very evil they have planned for me.10 Let burning coals fall down on their heads, or throw them into the fire, or into deep pits from which they can't escape.11 Don't let liars prosper here in our land. Cause disaster to fall with great force on the violent.12 But I know the LORD will surely help those they persecute; he will maintain the rights of the poor.13 Surely the godly are praising your name, for they will live in your presence.
