1  My heart is confident in you, O God; no wonder I can sing your praises! Wake up, my soul!2 Wake up, O harp and lyre! I will waken the dawn with my song.3 I will thank you, LORD, in front of all the people. I will sing your praises among the nations.4 For your unfailing love is higher than the heavens. Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.5 Be exalted, O God, above the highest heavens. May your glory shine over all the earth.6 Use your strong right arm to save me, and rescue your beloved people.7 God has promised this by his holiness[a]: "I will divide up Shechem with joy. I will measure out the valley of Succoth.8 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine. Ephraim will produce my warriors, and Judah will produce my kings.9 Moab will become my lowly servant, and Edom will be my slave. I will shout in triumph over the Philistines."10 But who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will bring me victory over Edom?11 Have you rejected us, O God? Will you no longer march with our armies?12 Oh, please help us against our enemies, for all human help is useless.13 With God's help we will do mighty things, for he will trample down our foes.
