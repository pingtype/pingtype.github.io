A song for pilgrims ascending to Jerusalem. 1 From the depths of despair, O Lord , I call for your help.
2 Hear my cry, O Lord. Pay attention to my prayer.
3 Lord , if you kept a record of our sins, who, O Lord, could ever survive?
4 But you offer forgiveness, that we might learn to fear you.
5 I am counting on the Lord ; yes, I am counting on him. I have put my hope in his word.
6 I long for the Lord more than sentries long for the dawn, yes, more than sentries long for the dawn.
7 O Israel, hope in the Lord ; for with the Lord  there is unfailing love. His redemption overflows.
8 He himself will redeem Israel from every kind of sin.
