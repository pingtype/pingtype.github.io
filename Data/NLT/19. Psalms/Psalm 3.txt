1  O LORD, I have so many enemies; so many are against me.
2 So many are saying, "God will never rescue him!"[a] 
3 But you, O LORD, are a shield around me, my glory, and the one who lifts my head high.
4 I cried out to the LORD, and he answered me from his holy mountain.
5 I lay down and slept. I woke up in safety, for the LORD was watching over me.
6 I am not afraid of ten thousand enemies who surround me on every side.
7 Arise, O LORD! Rescue me, my God! Slap all my enemies in the face! Shatter the teeth of the wicked!
8 Victory comes from you, O LORD. May your blessings rest on your people.
