1  In times of trouble, may the LORD respond to your cry. May the God of Israel[a] keep you safe from all harm.2 May he send you help from his sanctuary and strengthen you from Jerusalem.[b]3 May he remember all your gifts and look favorably on your burnt offerings.4 May he grant your heart's desire and fulfill all your plans.5 May we shout for joy when we hear of your victory, flying banners to honor our God. May the LORD answer all your prayers.6 Now I know that the LORD saves his anointed king. He will answer him from his holy heaven and rescue him by his great power.7 Some nations boast of their armies and weapons,[c] but we boast in the LORD our God.8 Those nations will fall down and collapse, but we will rise up and stand firm.9 Give victory to our king, O LORD! Respond to our cry for help.
