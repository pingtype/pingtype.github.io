A psalm of David. 1 I will sing of your love and justice, Lord . I will praise you with songs.2 I will be careful to live a blameless life- when will you come to help me? I will lead a life of integrity in my own home.3 I will refuse to look at anything vile and vulgar. I hate all who deal crookedly; I will have nothing to do with them.4 I will reject perverse ideas and stay away from every evil.5 I will not tolerate people who slander their neighbors. I will not endure conceit and pride.6 I will search for faithful people to be my companions. Only those who are above reproach will be allowed to serve me.7 I will not allow deceivers to serve in my house, and liars will not stay in my presence.8 My daily task will be to ferret out the wicked and free the city of the Lord  from their grip.
