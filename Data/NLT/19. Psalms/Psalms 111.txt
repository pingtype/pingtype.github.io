Praise the Lord ! I will thank the Lord  with all my heart as I meet with his godly people.2 How amazing are the deeds of the Lord ! All who delight in him should ponder them.3 Everything he does reveals his glory and majesty. His righteousness never fails.4 He causes us to remember his wonderful works. How gracious and merciful is our Lord !5 He gives food to those who fear him; he always remembers his covenant.6 He has shown his great power to his people by giving them the lands of other nations.7 All he does is just and good, and all his commandments are trustworthy.8 They are forever true, to be obeyed faithfully and with integrity.9 He has paid a full ransom for his people. He has guaranteed his covenant with them forever. What a holy, awe-inspiring name he has!10 Fear of the Lord  is the foundation of true wisdom. All who obey his commandments will grow in wisdom. Praise him forever!       Footnotes:a.   111 This psalm is a Hebrew acrostic poem; after the introductory note of praise, each line begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet. 1
