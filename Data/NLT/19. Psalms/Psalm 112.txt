1  Praise the LORD! Happy are those who fear the LORD. Yes, happy are those who delight in doing what he commands.2 Their children will be successful everywhere; an entire generation of godly people will be blessed.3 They themselves will be wealthy, and their good deeds will never be forgotten.4 When darkness overtakes the godly, light will come bursting in. They are[a] generous, compassionate, and righteous.5 All goes well for those who are generous, who lend freely and conduct their business fairly.6 Such people will not be overcome by evil circumstances. Those who are righteous will be long remembered.7 They do not fear bad news; they confidently trust the LORD to care for them.8 They are confident and fearless and can face their foes triumphantly.9 They give generously to those in need. Their good deeds will never be forgotten. They will have influence and honor.10 The wicked will be infuriated when they see this. They will grind their teeth in anger; they will slink away, their hopes thwarted.
