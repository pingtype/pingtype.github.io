A psalm of David. 1 The earth is the Lord 's, and everything in it. The world and all its people belong to him.2 For he laid the earth's foundation on the seas and built it on the ocean depths.3 Who may climb the mountain of the Lord ? Who may stand in his holy place?4 Only those whose hands and hearts are pure, who do not worship idols and never tell lies.5 They will receive the Lord 's blessing and have a right relationship with God their savior.6 Such people may seek you and worship in your presence, O God of Jacob.[a]Interlude7 Open up, ancient gates! Open up, ancient doors, and let the King of glory enter.8 Who is the King of glory? The Lord , strong and mighty; the Lord , invincible in battle.9 Open up, ancient gates! Open up, ancient doors, and let the King of glory enter.10 Who is the King of glory? The Lord  of Heaven's Armies- he is the King of glory. Interlude       Footnotes:a.   24:6 As in two Hebrew manuscripts and Greek and Syriac versions; most Hebrew manuscripts read O Jacob.
