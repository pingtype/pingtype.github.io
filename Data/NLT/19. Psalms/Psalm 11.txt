1  I trust in the LORD for protection. So why do you say to me, "Fly to the mountains for safety!2 The wicked are stringing their bows and setting their arrows in the bowstrings. They shoot from the shadows at those who do right.3 The foundations of law and order have collapsed. What can the righteous do?"4 But the LORD is in his holy Temple; the LORD still rules from heaven. He watches everything closely, examining everyone on earth.5 The LORD examines both the righteous and the wicked. He hates everyone who loves violence.6 He rains down blazing coals on the wicked, punishing them with burning sulfur and scorching winds.7 For the LORD is righteous, and he loves justice. Those who do what is right will see his face.
