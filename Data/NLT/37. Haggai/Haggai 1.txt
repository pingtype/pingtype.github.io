1On August 29[a] of the second year of King Darius's reign, the LORD gave a message through the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Jeshua[b] son of Jehozadak, the high priest. 2"This is what the LORD Almighty says: The people are saying, `The time has not yet come to rebuild the LORD's house--the Temple.' "3So the LORD sent this message through the prophet Haggai:  4"Why are you living in luxurious houses while my house lies in ruins?  5This is what the LORD Almighty says: Consider how things are going for you! 6You have planted much but harvested little. You have food to eat, but not enough to fill you up. You have wine to drink, but not enough to satisfy your thirst. You have clothing to wear, but not enough to keep you warm. Your wages disappear as though you were putting them in pockets filled with holes!7"This is what the LORD Almighty says: Consider how things are going for you!  8Now go up into the hills, bring down timber, and rebuild my house. Then I will take pleasure in it and be honored, says the LORD. 9You hoped for rich harvests, but they were poor. And when you brought your harvest home, I blew it away. Why? Because my house lies in ruins, says the LORD Almighty, while you are all busy building your own fine houses.  10That is why the heavens have withheld the dew and the earth has withheld its crops.  11I have called for a drought on your fields and hills--a drought to wither the grain and grapes and olives and all your other crops, a drought to starve both you and your cattle and to ruin everything you have worked so hard to get."12Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Jeshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the whole remnant of God's people obeyed the message from the LORD their God. It had been delivered by the prophet Haggai, whom the LORD their God had sent, and the people worshiped the LORD in earnest.  13Then Haggai, the LORD's messenger, gave the people this message from the LORD: "I am with you, says the LORD!"  14So the LORD sparked the enthusiasm of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, Jeshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the whole remnant of God's people. They came and began their work on the house of the LORD Almighty, their God.  15This was on September 21[c] of the second year of King Darius's reign.
