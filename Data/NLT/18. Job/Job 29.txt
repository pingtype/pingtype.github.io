[Job Speaks of His Former Blessings] 1 Job continued speaking:2 "I long for the years gone by when God took care of me,3 when he lit up the way before me and I walked safely through the darkness.4 When I was in my prime, God's friendship was felt in my home.5 The Almighty was still with me, and my children were around me.6 My steps were awash in cream, and the rocks gushed olive oil for me.7 "Those were the days when I went to the city gate and took my place among the honored leaders.8 The young stepped aside when they saw me, and even the aged rose in respect at my coming.9 The princes stood in silence and put their hands over their mouths.10 The highest officials of the city stood quietly, holding their tongues in respect.11 "All who heard me praised me. All who saw me spoke well of me.12 For I assisted the poor in their need and the orphans who required help.13 I helped those without hope, and they blessed me. And I caused the widows' hearts to sing for joy.14 Everything I did was honest. Righteousness covered me like a robe, and I wore justice like a turban.15 I served as eyes for the blind and feet for the lame.16 I was a father to the poor and assisted strangers who needed help.17 I broke the jaws of godless oppressors and plucked their victims from their teeth.18 "I thought, "Surely I will die surrounded by my family after a long, good life.*For I am like a tree whose roots reach the water, whose branches are refreshed with the dew.20 New honors are constantly bestowed on me, and my strength is continually renewed.'21 "Everyone listened to my advice. They were silent as they waited for me to speak.22 And after I spoke, they had nothing to add, for my counsel satisfied them.23 They longed for me to speak as people long for rain. They drank my words like a refreshing spring rain.24 When they were discouraged, I smiled at them. My look of approval was precious to them.25 Like a chief, I told them what to do. I lived like a king among his troops and comforted those who mourned.       Footnotes: 29:18 Hebrew after I have counted my days like sand. 19
