1Job's three friends refused to reply further to him because he kept insisting on his innocence.2Then Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the clan of Ram, became angry. He was angry because Job refused to admit that he had sinned and that God was right in punishing him.  3He was also angry with Job's three friends because they had condemned God[a] by their inability to answer Job's arguments.  4Elihu had waited for the others to speak because they were older than he.  5But when he saw that they had no further reply, he spoke out angrily.6Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said, "I am young and you are old, so I held back and did not dare to tell you what I think.  7I thought, `Those who are older should speak, for wisdom comes with age.'  8Surely it is God's Spirit within people, the breath of the Almighty within them, that makes them intelligent.  9But sometimes the elders are not wise. Sometimes the aged do not understand justice.  10So listen to me and let me express my opinion.11"I have waited all this time, listening very carefully to your arguments, listening to you grope for words. 12I have listened, but not one of you has refuted Job or answered his arguments.  13And don't tell me, `He is too wise for us. Only God can convince him.'  14If Job had been arguing with me, I would not answer with that kind of logic!  15You sit there baffled, with no further response.  16Should I continue to wait, now that you are silent? Must I also remain silent?  17No, I will say my piece. I will speak my mind. I surely will.  18For I am pent up and full of words, and the spirit within me urges me on.  19I am like a wine cask without a vent. My words are ready to burst out!  20I must speak to find relief, so let me give my answers.  21I won't play favorites or try to flatter anyone.  22And if I tried, my Creator would soon do away with me.
