[Job's Final Speech] 1 Job continued speaking:2 "I vow by the living God, who has taken away my rights, by the Almighty who has embittered my soul-3 As long as I live, while I have breath from God,4 my lips will speak no evil, and my tongue will speak no lies.5 I will never concede that you are right; I will defend my integrity until I die.6 I will maintain my innocence without wavering. My conscience is clear for as long as I live.7 "May my enemy be punished like the wicked, my adversary like those who do evil.8 For what hope do the godless have when God cuts them off and takes away their life?9 Will God listen to their cry when trouble comes upon them?10 Can they take delight in the Almighty? Can they call to God at any time?11 I will teach you about God's power. I will not conceal anything concerning the Almighty.12 But you have seen all this, yet you say all these useless things to me.13 "This is what the wicked will receive from God; this is their inheritance from the Almighty.14 They may have many children, but the children will die in war or starve to death.15 Those who survive will die of a plague, and not even their widows will mourn them.16 "Evil people may have piles of money and may store away mounds of clothing.17 But the righteous will wear that clothing, and the innocent will divide that money.18 The wicked build houses as fragile as a spider's web,*as flimsy as a shelter made of branches.19 The wicked go to bed rich but wake to find that all their wealth is gone.20 Terror overwhelms them like a flood, and they are blown away in the storms of the night.21 The east wind carries them away, and they are gone. It sweeps them away.22 It whirls down on them without mercy. They struggle to flee from its power.23 But everyone jeers at them and mocks them.       Footnotes: 27:18 As in Greek and Syriac versions (see also 8:14); Hebrew reads a moth.
