1 "My heart pounds as I think of this. It leaps within me.  2Listen carefully to the thunder of God's voice as it rolls from his mouth.  3It rolls across the heavens, and his lightning flashes out in every direction.  4Then comes the roaring of the thunder--the tremendous voice of his majesty. He does not restrain the thunder when he speaks.  5God's voice is glorious in the thunder. We cannot comprehend the greatness of his power.6"He directs the snow to fall on the earth and tells the rain to pour down.  7Everyone stops working at such a time so they can recognize his power.  8The wild animals hide in the rocks or in their dens.  9The stormy wind comes from its chamber, and the driving winds bring the cold.  10God's breath sends the ice, freezing wide expanses of water.  11He loads the clouds with moisture, and they flash with his lightning.  12The clouds turn around and around under his direction. They do whatever he commands throughout the earth.  13He causes things to happen on earth, either as a punishment or as a sign of his unfailing love.14"Listen, Job; stop and consider the wonderful miracles of God!  15Do you know how God controls the storm and causes the lightning to flash forth from his clouds?  16Do you understand how he balances the clouds with wonderful perfection and skill?  17When you are sweltering in your clothes and the south wind dies down and everything is still,  18he makes the skies reflect the heat like a giant mirror. Can you do that?19"You think you know so much, so teach the rest of us what to say to God. We are too ignorant to make our own arguments.  20Should God be told that I want to speak? Can we speak when we are confused?  21We cannot look at the sun, for it shines brightly in the sky when the wind clears away the clouds.  22Golden splendor comes from the mountain of God. He is clothed in dazzling splendor.  23We cannot imagine the power of the Almighty, yet he is so just and merciful that he does not oppress us.  24No wonder people everywhere fear him. People who are truly wise show him reverence."
