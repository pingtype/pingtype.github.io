[Job's Eighth Speech: A Response to Eliphaz] 1 Then Job spoke again:2 "My complaint today is still a bitter one, and I try hard not to groan aloud.3 If only I knew where to find God, I would go to his court.4 I would lay out my case and present my arguments.5 Then I would listen to his reply and understand what he says to me.6 Would he use his great power to argue with me? No, he would give me a fair hearing.7 Honest people can reason with him, so I would be forever acquitted by my judge.8 I go east, but he is not there. I go west, but I cannot find him.9 I do not see him in the north, for he is hidden. I look to the south, but he is concealed.10 "But he knows where I am going. And when he tests me, I will come out as pure as gold.11 For I have stayed on God's paths; I have followed his ways and not turned aside.12 I have not departed from his commands, but have treasured his words more than daily food.13 But once he has made his decision, who can change his mind? Whatever he wants to do, he does.14 So he will do to me whatever he has planned. He controls my destiny.15 No wonder I am so terrified in his presence. When I think of it, terror grips me.16 God has made me sick at heart; the Almighty has terrified me.17 Darkness is all around me; thick, impenetrable darkness is everywhere.       Footnotes:
