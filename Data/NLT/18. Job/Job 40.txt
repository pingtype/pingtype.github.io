1 Then the Lord  said to Job,2 "Do you still want to argue with the Almighty? You are God's critic, but do you have the answers?" [Job Responds to the Lord3] Then Job replied to the Lord ,4 "I am nothing-how could I ever find the answers? I will cover my mouth with my hand.5 I have said too much already. I have nothing more to say." [The Lord Challenges Job Again] 6 Then the Lord  answered Job from the whirlwind:7 "Brace yourself like a man, because I have some questions for you, and you must answer them.8 "Will you discredit my justice and condemn me just to prove you are right?9 Are you as strong as God? Can you thunder with a voice like his?10 All right, put on your glory and splendor, your honor and majesty.11 Give vent to your anger. Let it overflow against the proud.12 Humiliate the proud with a glance; walk on the wicked where they stand.13 Bury them in the dust. Imprison them in the world of the dead.14 Then even I would praise you, for your own strength would save you.15 "Take a look at Behemoth,[a]which I made, just as I made you. It eats grass like an ox.16 See its powerful loins and the muscles of its belly.17 Its tail is as strong as a cedar. The sinews of its thighs are knit tightly together.18 Its bones are tubes of bronze. Its limbs are bars of iron.19 It is a prime example of God's handiwork, and only its Creator can threaten it.20 The mountains offer it their best food, where all the wild animals play.21 It lies under the lotus plants,[b]hidden by the reeds in the marsh.22 The lotus plants give it shade among the willows beside the stream.23 It is not disturbed by the raging river, not concerned when the swelling Jordan rushes around it.24 No one can catch it off guard or put a ring in its nose and lead it away.       Footnotes:a.   40:15 The identification of Behemoth is disputed, ranging from an earthly creature to a mythical sea monster in ancient literature.  b.   40:21 Or bramble bushes; also in 40:22.
