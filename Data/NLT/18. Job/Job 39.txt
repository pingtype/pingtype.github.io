1"Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Have you watched as the wild deer are born?  2Do you know how many months they carry their young? Are you aware of the time of their delivery?  3They crouch down to give birth to their young and deliver their offspring.  4Their young grow up in the open fields, then leave their parents and never return.5"Who makes the wild donkey wild?  6I have placed it in the wilderness; its home is the wasteland.  7It hates the noise of the city, and it has no driver to shout at it.  8The mountains are its pastureland, where it searches for every blade of grass.9"Will the wild ox consent to being tamed? Will it stay in your stall?  10Can you hitch a wild ox to a plow? Will it plow a field for you?  11Since it is so strong, can you trust it? Can you go away and trust the ox to do your work?  12Can you rely on it to return, bringing your grain to the threshing floor?13"The ostrich flaps her wings grandly, but they are no match for the feathers of the stork.  14She lays her eggs on top of the earth, letting them be warmed in the dust.  15She doesn't worry that a foot might crush them or that wild animals might destroy them.  16She is harsh toward her young, as if they were not her own. She is unconcerned though they die,  17for God has deprived her of wisdom. He has given her no understanding.  18But whenever she jumps up to run, she passes the swiftest horse with its rider.19"Have you given the horse its strength or clothed its neck with a flowing mane?  20Did you give it the ability to leap forward like a locust? Its majestic snorting is something to hear!  21It paws the earth and rejoices in its strength. When it charges to war,  22it is unafraid. It does not run from the sword.  23The arrows rattle against it, and the spear and javelin flash.  24Fiercely it paws the ground and rushes forward into battle when the trumpet blows.  25It snorts at the sound of the bugle. It senses the battle even at a distance. It quivers at the noise of battle and the shout of the captain's commands.26"Are you the one who makes the hawk soar and spread its wings to the south?  27Is it at your command that the eagle rises to the heights to make its nest?  28It lives on the cliffs, making its home on a distant, rocky crag.  29From there it hunts its prey, keeping watch with piercing eyes.  30Its nestlings gulp down blood, for it feeds on the carcass of the slaughtered."
