1Then Zophar the Naamathite replied to Job:2"Shouldn't someone answer this torrent of words? Is a person proved innocent just by talking a lot? 3Should I remain silent while you babble on? When you mock God, shouldn't someone make you ashamed? 4You claim, `My teaching is pure,' and `I am clean in the sight of God.'  5If only God would speak; if only he would tell you what he thinks!  6If only he would tell you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom is not a simple matter. Listen! God is doubtless punishing you far less than you deserve!7"Can you solve the mysteries of God? Can you discover everything there is to know about the Almighty? 8Such knowledge is higher than the heavens--but who are you? It is deeper than the underworld[a]--what can you know in comparison to him?  9It is broader than the earth and wider than the sea.  10If God comes along and puts a person in prison, or if he calls the court to order, who is going to stop him?  11For he knows those who are false, and he takes note of all their sins.  12An empty-headed person won't become wise any more than a wild donkey can bear human offspring[b]!13"If only you would prepare your heart and lift up your hands to him in prayer!  14Get rid of your sins and leave all iniquity behind you.  15Then your face will brighten in innocence. You will be strong and free of fear. 16You will forget your misery. It will all be gone like water under the bridge.  17Your life will be brighter than the noonday. Any darkness will be as bright as morning.  18You will have courage because you will have hope. You will be protected and will rest in safety.  19You will lie down unafraid, and many will look to you for help. 20But the wicked will lose hope. They have no escape. Their hope becomes despair."
