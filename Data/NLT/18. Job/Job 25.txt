1Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:2"God is powerful and dreadful. He enforces peace in the heavens.  3Who is able to count his heavenly army? Does his light not shine on all the earth?  4How can a mere mortal stand before God and claim to be righteous? Who in all the earth is pure?  5God is so glorious that even the moon and stars scarcely shine compared to him.  6How much less are mere people, who are but worms in his sight?"
