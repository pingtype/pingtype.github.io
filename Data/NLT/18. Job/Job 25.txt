[Bildad's Third Response to Job] 1 Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:2 "God is powerful and dreadful. He enforces peace in the heavens.3 Who is able to count his heavenly army? Doesn't his light shine on all the earth?4 How can a mortal be innocent before God? Can anyone born of a woman be pure?5 God is more glorious than the moon; he shines brighter than the stars.6 In comparison, people are maggots; we mortals are mere worms."
