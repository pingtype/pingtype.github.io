[Job's Ninth Speech: A Response to Bildad] 1 Then Job spoke again:2 "How you have helped the powerless! How you have saved the weak!3 How you have enlightened my stupidity! What wise advice you have offered!4 Where have you gotten all these wise sayings? Whose spirit speaks through you?5 "The dead tremble- those who live beneath the waters.6 The underworld* is naked in God's presence. The place of destruction* is uncovered.7 God stretches the northern sky over empty space and hangs the earth on nothing.8 He wraps the rain in his thick clouds, and the clouds don't burst with the weight.9 He covers the face of the moon,*shrouding it with his clouds.10 He created the horizon when he separated the waters; he set the boundary between day and night.11 The foundations of heaven tremble; they shudder at his rebuke.12 By his power the sea grew calm. By his skill he crushed the great sea monster.*His Spirit made the heavens beautiful, and his power pierced the gliding serpent.14 These are just the beginning of all that he does, merely a whisper of his power. Who, then, can comprehend the thunder of his power?"       Footnotes: 26:6a Hebrew Sheol.   26:6b Hebrew Abaddon.   26:9 Or covers his throne.   26:12 Hebrew Rahab, the name of a mythical sea monster that represents chaos in ancient literature. 13
