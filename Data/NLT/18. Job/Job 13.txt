1"Look, I have seen many instances such as you describe. I understand what you are saying.  2I know as much as you do. You are no better than I am.  3Oh, how I long to speak directly to the Almighty. I want to argue my case with God himself.  4For you are smearing me with lies. As doctors, you are worthless quacks. 5Please be quiet! That's the smartest thing you could do.  6Listen to my charge; pay attention to my arguments.7"Are you defending God by means of lies and dishonest arguments?  8You should be impartial witnesses, but will you slant your testimony in his favor? Will you argue God's case for him?  9Be careful that he doesn't find out what you are doing! Or do you think you can fool him as easily as you fool people?  10No, you will be in serious trouble with him if even in your hearts you slant your testimony in his favor.  11Doesn't his majesty strike terror into your heart? Does not your fear of him seize you?  12Your statements have about as much value as ashes. Your defense is as fragile as a clay pot.13"Be silent now and leave me alone. Let me speak--and I will face the consequences.  14Yes, I will take my life in my hands and say what I really think.  15God might kill me, but I cannot wait. I am going to argue my case with him.  16But this is what will save me: that I am not godless. If I were, I would be thrown from his presence.17"Listen closely to what I am about to say. Hear me out.  18I have prepared my case; I will be proved innocent.  19Who can argue with me over this? If you could prove me wrong, I would remain silent until I die.20"O God, there are two things I beg of you, and I will be able to face you.  21Remove your hand from me, and don't terrify me with your awesome presence.  22Now summon me, and I will answer! Or let me speak to you, and you reply.  23Tell me, what have I done wrong? Show me my rebellion and my sin.  24Why do you turn away from me? Why do you consider me your enemy?  25Would you terrify a leaf that is blown by the wind? Would you chase a dry stalk of grass?26"You write bitter accusations against me and bring up all the sins of my youth.  27You put my feet in stocks. You watch all my paths. You trace all my footprints.  28I waste away like rotting wood, like a moth-eaten coat.
