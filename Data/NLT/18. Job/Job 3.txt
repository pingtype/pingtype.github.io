1At last Job spoke, and he cursed the day of his birth.  2He said:3"Cursed be the day of my birth, and cursed be the night when I was conceived.  4Let that day be turned to darkness. Let it be lost even to God on high, and let it be shrouded in darkness.  5Yes, let the darkness and utter gloom claim it for its own. Let a black cloud overshadow it, and let the darkness terrify it.  6Let that night be blotted off the calendar, never again to be counted among the days of the year, never again to appear among the months.  7Let that night be barren. Let it have no joy.  8Let those who are experts at cursing--those who are ready to rouse the sea monster[a]--curse that day.  9Let its morning stars remain dark. Let it hope for light, but in vain; may it never see the morning light.  10Curse it for its failure to shut my mother's womb, for letting me be born to all this trouble.11"Why didn't I die at birth as I came from the womb?  12Why did my mother let me live? Why did she nurse me at her breasts?  13For if I had died at birth, I would be at peace now, asleep and at rest.  14I would rest with the world's kings and prime ministers, famous for their great construction projects.  15I would rest with wealthy princes whose palaces were filled with gold and silver.  16Why was I not buried like a stillborn child, like a baby who never lives to see the light?  17For in death the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest.  18Even prisoners are at ease in death, with no guards to curse them.  19Rich and poor are there alike, and the slave is free from his master.20"Oh, why should light be given to the weary, and life to those in misery?  21They long for death, and it won't come. They search for death more eagerly than for hidden treasure.  22It is a blessed relief when they finally die, when they find the grave.  23Why is life given to those with no future, those destined by God to live in distress?  24I cannot eat for sighing; my groans pour out like water.  25What I always feared has happened to me. What I dreaded has come to be.  26I have no peace, no quietness. I have no rest; instead, only trouble comes."
