1The people of Judah then crowned Amaziah's sixteen-year-old son, Uzziah, as their next king.  2After his father's death, Uzziah rebuilt the town of Elath[a] and restored it to Judah.  3Uzziah was sixteen when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. His mother was Jecoliah, from Jerusalem.  4He did what was pleasing in the LORD's sight, just as his father, Amaziah, had done.  5Uzziah sought God during the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God. And as long as the king sought the LORD, God gave him success.6He declared war on the Philistines and broke down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod. Then he built new towns in the Ashdod area and in other parts of Philistia.  7God helped him not only with his wars against the Philistines, but also in his battles with the Arabs of Gur[b] and in his wars with the Meunites.  8The Meunites[c] paid annual tribute to him, and his fame spread even to Egypt, for he had become very powerful.9Uzziah built fortified towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the angle in the wall.  10He also constructed forts in the wilderness and dug many water cisterns, because he kept great herds of livestock in the foothills of Judah[d] and on the plains. He was also a man who loved the soil. He had many workers who cared for his farms and vineyards, both on the hillsides and in the fertile valleys.11Uzziah had an army of well-trained warriors, ready to march into battle, unit by unit. This great army of fighting men had been mustered and organized by Jeiel, the secretary of the army, and his assistant, Maaseiah. They were under the direction of Hananiah, one of the king's officials.  12Twenty-six hundred clan leaders commanded these regiments of seasoned warriors.  13The army consisted of 307,500 men, all elite troops. They were prepared to assist the king against any enemy.  14Uzziah provided the entire army with shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows, and sling stones.  15And he produced machines mounted on the walls of Jerusalem, designed by brilliant men to shoot arrows and hurl stones[e] from the towers and the corners of the wall. His fame spread far and wide, for the LORD helped him wonderfully until he became very powerful.16But when he had become powerful, he also became proud, which led to his downfall. He sinned against the LORD his God by entering the sanctuary of the LORD's Temple and personally burning incense on the altar. 17Azariah the high priest went in after him with eighty other priests of the LORD, all brave men.  18They confronted King Uzziah and said, "It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD. That is the work of the priests alone, the sons of Aaron who are set apart for this work. Get out of the sanctuary, for you have sinned. The LORD God will not honor you for this!"19Uzziah was furious and refused to set down the incense burner he was holding. But as he was standing there with the priests before the incense altar in the LORD's Temple, leprosy[f] suddenly broke out on his forehead.  20When Azariah and the other priests saw the leprosy, they rushed him out. And the king himself was eager to get out because the LORD had struck him.  21So King Uzziah had leprosy until the day he died. He lived in isolation, excluded from the Temple of the LORD. His son Jotham was put in charge of the royal palace, and he governed the people of the land.22The rest of the events of Uzziah's reign, from beginning to end, are recorded by the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.  23So Uzziah died, and since he had leprosy, he was buried nearby in a burial field belonging to the kings. Then his son Jotham became the next king.
