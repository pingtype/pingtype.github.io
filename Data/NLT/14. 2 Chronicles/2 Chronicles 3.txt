[Solomon Builds the Temple] 1 So Solomon began to build the Temple of the Lord  in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the Lord  had appeared to David, his father. The Temple was built on the threshing floor of Araunah* the Jebusite, the site that David had selected. 2 The construction began in midspring,* during the fourth year of Solomon's reign.3 These are the dimensions Solomon used for the foundation of the Temple of God (using the old standard of measurement).* It was 90 feet long and 30 feet wide.* 4 The entry room at the front of the Temple was 30 feet* wide, running across the entire width of the Temple, and 30 feet* high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold.5 He paneled the main room of the Temple with cypress wood, overlaid it with fine gold, and decorated it with carvings of palm trees and chains. 6 He decorated the walls of the Temple with beautiful jewels and with gold from the land of Parvaim. 7 He overlaid the beams, thresholds, walls, and doors throughout the Temple with gold, and he carved figures of cherubim on the walls.8 He made the Most Holy Place 30 feet wide, corresponding to the width of the Temple, and 30 feet deep. He overlaid its interior with 23 tons* of fine gold. 9 The gold nails that were used weighed 20 ounces* each. He also overlaid the walls of the upper rooms with gold.10 He made two figures shaped like cherubim, overlaid them with gold, and placed them in the Most Holy Place. 11 The total wingspan of the two cherubim standing side by side was 30 feet. One wing of the first figure was 7 1 / 2  feet* long, and it touched the Temple wall. The other wing, also 7 1 / 2  feet long, touched one of the wings of the second figure. 12 In the same way, the second figure had one wing 7 1 / 2  feet long that touched the opposite wall. The other wing, also 7 1 / 2  feet long, touched the wing of the first figure. 13 So the wingspan of the two cherubim side by side was 30 feet. They stood on their feet and faced out toward the main room of the Temple.14 Across the entrance of the Most Holy Place he hung a curtain made of fine linen, decorated with blue, purple, and scarlet thread and embroidered with figures of cherubim.15 For the front of the Temple, he made two pillars that were 27 feet* tall, each topped by a capital extending upward another 7 1 / 2  feet. 16 He made a network of interwoven chains* and used them to decorate the tops of the pillars. He also made 100 decorative pomegranates and attached them to the chains. 17 Then he set up the two pillars at the entrance of the Temple, one to the south of the entrance and the other to the north. He named the one on the south Jakin, and the one on the north Boaz.*Footnotes: 3:1 Hebrew reads Ornan, a variant spelling of Araunah; compare 2 Sam 24:16.   3:2 Hebrew on the second [day] of the second month.
