1When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon's reputation, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. She arrived with a large group of attendants and a great caravan of camels loaded with spices, huge quantities of gold, and precious jewels.  2When she met with Solomon, they talked about everything she had on her mind. Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too hard for him to explain to her. 3When the queen of Sheba realized how wise Solomon was, and when she saw the palace he had built,  4she was breathless. She was also amazed at the food on his tables, the organization of his officials and their splendid clothing, the cup-bearers and their robes, and the burnt offerings Solomon made at the Temple of the LORD.5She exclaimed to the king, "Everything I heard in my country about your achievements and wisdom is true!  6I didn't believe it until I arrived here and saw it with my own eyes. Truly I had not heard the half of it! Your wisdom is far greater than what I was told.  7How happy these people must be! What a privilege for your officials to stand here day after day, listening to your wisdom!  8The LORD your God is great indeed! He delights in you and has placed you on the throne to rule for him. Because God loves Israel so much and desires this kingdom to last forever, he has made you king so you can rule with justice and righteousness."9Then she gave the king a gift of nine thousand pounds[a] of gold, and great quantities of spices and precious jewels. Never before had there been spices as fine as those the queen of Sheba gave to Solomon.10(When the crews of Hiram and Solomon brought gold from Ophir, they also brought rich cargoes of almug wood[b] and precious jewels.  11The king used the almug wood to make steps[c] for the Temple of the LORD and the royal palace, and to construct harps and lyres for the musicians. Never before had there been such beautiful instruments in Judah.)12King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba whatever she asked for--gifts of greater value than the gifts she had given him. Then she and all her attendants left and returned to their own land.13Each year Solomon received about 25 tons[d] of gold.  14This did not include the additional revenue he received from merchants and traders. All the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land also brought gold and silver to Solomon.15King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold, each containing over 15 pounds[e] of gold.  16He also made three hundred smaller shields of hammered gold, each containing about 7 1/2 pounds[f] of gold. The king placed these shields in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon.17Then the king made a huge ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold.  18The throne had six steps, and there was a footstool of gold attached to it. On both sides of the seat were armrests, with the figure of a lion standing on each side of the throne.  19Solomon made twelve other lion figures, one standing on each end of each of the six steps. No other throne in all the world could be compared with it!20All of King Solomon's drinking cups were solid gold, as were all the utensils in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. They were not made of silver because silver was considered of little value in Solomon's day!21The king had a fleet of trading ships[g] manned by the sailors sent by Hiram.[h] Once every three years the ships returned, loaded down with gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.[i]22So King Solomon became richer and wiser than any other king in all the earth.  23Kings from every nation came to visit him and to hear the wisdom God had given him.  24Year after year, everyone who came to visit brought him gifts of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules.25Solomon had four thousand stalls for his chariot horses and twelve thousand horses.[j] He stationed many of them in the chariot cities, and some near him in Jerusalem.  26He ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River[k] to the land of the Philistines and the border of Egypt.  27The king made silver as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones. And valuable cedarwood was as common as the sycamore wood that grows in the foothills of Judah.[l]  28Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt[m] and many other countries.29The rest of the events of Solomon's reign, from beginning to end, are recorded in The Record of Nathan the Prophet and in The Prophecy of Ahijah from Shiloh, and also in The Visions of Iddo the Seer, concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat.  30Solomon ruled in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years.  31When he died, he was buried in the city of his father, David. Then his son Rehoboam became the next king.
