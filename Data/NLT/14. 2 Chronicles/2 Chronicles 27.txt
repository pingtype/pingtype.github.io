1Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. His mother was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.  2He did what was pleasing in the LORD's sight, just as his father, Uzziah, had done. But unlike him, Jotham did not enter the Temple of the LORD. Nevertheless, the people continued in their corrupt ways.3Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate to the LORD's Temple and also did extensive rebuilding on the wall at the hill of Ophel.  4He built towns in the hill country of Judah and constructed fortresses and towers in the wooded areas.  5Jotham waged war against the Ammonites and conquered them. For the next three years, he received from them an annual tribute of 7,500 pounds[a] of silver, 50,000 bushels of wheat, and 50,000 bushels of barley.[b]6King Jotham became powerful because he was careful to live in obedience to the LORD his God.7The rest of the events of Jotham's reign, including his wars and other activities, are recorded in The Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.  8He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years.  9When he died, he was buried in the City of David, and his son Ahaz became the next king.
