1I urge you, first of all, to pray for all people. As you make your requests, plead for God's mercy upon them, and give thanks.  2Pray this way for kings and all others who are in authority, so that we can live in peace and quietness, in godliness and dignity.  3This is good and pleases God our Savior,  4for he wants everyone to be saved and to understand the truth.  5For there is only one God and one Mediator who can reconcile God and people. He is the man Christ Jesus.  6He gave his life to purchase freedom for everyone. This is the message that God gave to the world at the proper time.  7And I have been chosen--this is the absolute truth--as a preacher and apostle to teach the Gentiles about faith and truth.8So wherever you assemble, I want men to pray with holy hands lifted up to God, free from anger and controversy.  9And I want women to be modest in their appearance. They should wear decent and appropriate clothing and not draw attention to themselves by the way they fix their hair or by wearing gold or pearls or expensive clothes.  10For women who claim to be devoted to God should make themselves attractive by the good things they do.11Women should listen and learn quietly and submissively.  12I do not let women teach men or have authority over them. Let them listen quietly.  13For God made Adam first, and afterward he made Eve.  14And it was the woman, not Adam, who was deceived by Satan, and sin was the result.  15But women will be saved through childbearing[a] and by continuing to live in faith, love, holiness, and modesty.
