1 Christians who are slaves should give their masters full respect so that the name of God and his teaching will not be shamed.  2If your master is a Christian, that is no excuse for being disrespectful. You should work all the harder because you are helping another believer[a] by your efforts. Teach these truths, Timothy, and encourage everyone to obey them.  3Some false teachers may deny these things, but these are the sound, wholesome teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ, and they are the foundation for a godly life.  4Anyone who teaches anything different is both conceited and ignorant. Such a person has an unhealthy desire to quibble over the meaning of words. This stirs up arguments ending in jealousy, fighting, slander, and evil suspicions.  5These people always cause trouble. Their minds are corrupt, and they don't tell the truth. To them religion is just a way to get rich.6Yet true religion with contentment is great wealth.  7After all, we didn't bring anything with us when we came into the world, and we certainly cannot carry anything with us when we die.  8So if we have enough food and clothing, let us be content.  9But people who long to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many foolish and harmful desires that plunge them into ruin and destruction.  10For the love of money is at the root of all kinds of evil. And some people, craving money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows.11But you, Timothy, belong to God; so run from all these evil things, and follow what is right and good. Pursue a godly life, along with faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.  12Fight the good fight for what we believe. Hold tightly to the eternal life that God has given you, which you have confessed so well before many witnesses.  13And I command you before God, who gives life to all, and before Christ Jesus, who gave a good testimony before Pontius Pilate,  14that you obey his commands with all purity. Then no one can find fault with you from now until our Lord Jesus Christ returns.  15For at the right time Christ will be revealed from heaven by the blessed and only almighty God, the King of kings and Lord of lords.  16He alone can never die, and he lives in light so brilliant that no human can approach him. No one has ever seen him, nor ever will. To him be honor and power forever. Amen.17Tell those who are rich in this world not to be proud and not to trust in their money, which will soon be gone. But their trust should be in the living God, who richly gives us all we need for our enjoyment.  18Tell them to use their money to do good. They should be rich in good works and should give generously to those in need, always being ready to share with others whatever God has given them.  19By doing this they will be storing up their treasure as a good foundation for the future so that they may take hold of real life.20Timothy, guard what God has entrusted to you. Avoid godless, foolish discussions with those who oppose you with their so-called knowledge.  21Some people have wandered from the faith by following such foolishness. May God's grace be with you all.
