1Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from inside the fish.  2He said, "I cried out to the LORD in my great trouble, and he answered me. I called to you from the world of the dead,[a] and LORD, you heard me!  3You threw me into the ocean depths, and I sank down to the heart of the sea. I was buried beneath your wild and stormy waves.  4Then I said, `O LORD, you have driven me from your presence. How will I ever again see your holy Temple?'5"I sank beneath the waves, and death was very near. The waters closed in around me, and seaweed wrapped itself around my head.  6I sank down to the very roots of the mountains. I was locked out of life and imprisoned in the land of the dead. But you, O LORD my God, have snatched me from the yawning jaws of death!7"When I had lost all hope, I turned my thoughts once more to the LORD. And my earnest prayer went out to you in your holy Temple.  8Those who worship false gods turn their backs on all God's mercies.  9But I will offer sacrifices to you with songs of praise, and I will fulfill all my vows. For my salvation comes from the LORD alone."10Then the LORD ordered the fish to spit up Jonah on the beach, and it did.
