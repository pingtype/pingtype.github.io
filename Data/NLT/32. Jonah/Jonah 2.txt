[Jonah's Prayer] 1[a]Then Jonah prayed to the Lord  his God from inside the fish. 2 He said, "I cried out to the Lord  in my great trouble, and he answered me. I called to you from the land of the dead,[b]and Lord , you heard me!3 You threw me into the ocean depths, and I sank down to the heart of the sea. The mighty waters engulfed me; I was buried beneath your wild and stormy waves.4 Then I said, "O Lord , you have driven me from your presence. Yet I will look once more toward your holy Temple.'5 "I sank beneath the waves, and the waters closed over me. Seaweed wrapped itself around my head.6 I sank down to the very roots of the mountains. I was imprisoned in the earth, whose gates lock shut forever. But you, O Lord  my God, snatched me from the jaws of death!7 As my life was slipping away, I remembered the Lord . And my earnest prayer went out to you in your holy Temple.8 Those who worship false gods turn their backs on all God's mercies.9 But I will offer sacrifices to you with songs of praise, and I will fulfill all my vows. For my salvation comes from the Lord  alone."10 Then the Lord  ordered the fish to spit Jonah out onto the beach.       Footnotes:a.   2:1 Verses 2:1-10 are numbered 2:2-11 in Hebrew text.  b.   2:2 Hebrew from Sheol.
