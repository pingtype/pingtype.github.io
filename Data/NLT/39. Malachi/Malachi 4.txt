1The LORD Almighty says, "The day of judgment is coming, burning like a furnace. The arrogant and the wicked will be burned up like straw on that day. They will be consumed like a tree--roots and all.2"But for you who fear my name, the Sun of Righteousness will rise with healing in his wings.[a] And you will go free, leaping with joy like calves let out to pasture.  3On the day when I act, you will tread upon the wicked as if they were dust under your feet," says the LORD Almighty.4"Remember to obey the instructions of my servant Moses, all the laws and regulations that I gave him on Mount Sinai[b] for all Israel.5"Look, I am sending you the prophet Elijah before the great and dreadful day of the LORD arrives.  6His preaching will turn the hearts of parents[c] to their children, and the hearts of children to their parents. Otherwise I will come and strike the land with a curse."
