[The Coming Day of Judgment] 1*The Lord  of Heaven's Armies says, "The day of judgment is coming, burning like a furnace. On that day the arrogant and the wicked will be burned up like straw. They will be consumed-roots, branches, and all.2 "But for you who fear my name, the Sun of Righteousness will rise with healing in his wings.* And you will go free, leaping with joy like calves let out to pasture. 3 On the day when I act, you will tread upon the wicked as if they were dust under your feet," says the Lord  of Heaven's Armies.4 "Remember to obey the Law of Moses, my servant-all the decrees and regulations that I gave him on Mount Sinai* for all Israel.5 "Look, I am sending you the prophet Elijah before the great and dreadful day of the Lord  arrives. 6 His preaching will turn the hearts of fathers to their children, and the hearts of children to their fathers. Otherwise I will come and strike the land with a curse."       Footnotes: 4:1 Verses 4:1-6 are numbered 3:19-24 in Hebrew text.   4:2 Or the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings.   4:4 Hebrew Horeb, another name for Sinai.
