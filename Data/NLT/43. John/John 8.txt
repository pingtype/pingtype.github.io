1Jesus returned to the Mount of Olives,  2but early the next morning he was back again at the Temple. A crowd soon gathered, and he sat down and taught them.  3As he was speaking, the teachers of religious law and Pharisees brought a woman they had caught in the act of adultery. They put her in front of the crowd.4"Teacher," they said to Jesus, "this woman was caught in the very act of adultery.  5The law of Moses says to stone her. What do you say?"6They were trying to trap him into saying something they could use against him, but Jesus stooped down and wrote in the dust with his finger.  7They kept demanding an answer, so he stood up again and said, "All right, stone her. But let those who have never sinned throw the first stones!"  8Then he stooped down again and wrote in the dust.9When the accusers heard this, they slipped away one by one, beginning with the oldest, until only Jesus was left in the middle of the crowd with the woman.  10Then Jesus stood up again and said to her, "Where are your accusers? Didn't even one of them condemn you?"11"No, Lord," she said. And Jesus said, "Neither do I. Go and sin no more."12Jesus said to the people, "I am the light of the world. If you follow me, you won't be stumbling through the darkness, because you will have the light that leads to life."13The Pharisees replied, "You are making false claims about yourself!"14Jesus told them, "These claims are valid even though I make them about myself. For I know where I came from and where I am going, but you don't know this about me.  15You judge me with all your human limitations,[a] but I am not judging anyone.  16And if I did, my judgment would be correct in every respect because I am not alone--I have with me the Father who sent me.  17Your own law says that if two people agree about something, their witness is accepted as fact.[b]  18I am one witness, and my Father who sent me is the other."19"Where is your father?" they asked. Jesus answered, "Since you don't know who I am, you don't know who my Father is. If you knew me, then you would know my Father, too."  20Jesus made these statements while he was teaching in the section of the Temple known as the Treasury. But he was not arrested, because his time had not yet come.21Later Jesus said to them again, "I am going away. You will search for me and die in your sin. You cannot come where I am going."22The Jewish leaders asked, "Is he planning to commit suicide? What does he mean, `You cannot come where I am going'?"23Then he said to them, "You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not.  24That is why I said that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am who I say I am, you will die in your sins."25"Tell us who you are," they demanded. Jesus replied, "I am the one I have always claimed to be.[c]  26I have much to say about you and much to condemn, but I won't. For I say only what I have heard from the one who sent me, and he is true."  27But they still didn't understand that he was talking to them about his Father.28So Jesus said, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man on the cross, then you will realize that I am he and that I do nothing on my own, but I speak what the Father taught me.  29And the one who sent me is with me--he has not deserted me. For I always do those things that are pleasing to him."  30Then many who heard him say these things believed in him.31Jesus said to the people[d] who believed in him, "You are truly my disciples if you keep obeying my teachings.  32And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."33"But we are descendants of Abraham," they said. "We have never been slaves to anyone on earth. What do you mean, `set free'?"34Jesus replied, "I assure you that everyone who sins is a slave of sin.  35A slave is not a permanent member of the family, but a son is part of the family forever.  36So if the Son sets you free, you will indeed be free.  37Yes, I realize that you are descendants of Abraham. And yet some of you are trying to kill me because my message does not find a place in your hearts.  38I am telling you what I saw when I was with my Father. But you are following the advice of your father."39"Our father is Abraham," they declared. "No," Jesus replied, "for if you were children of Abraham, you would follow his good example.[e]  40I told you the truth I heard from God, but you are trying to kill me. Abraham wouldn't do a thing like that.  41No, you are obeying your real father when you act that way." They replied, "We were not born out of wedlock! Our true Father is God himself."42Jesus told them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, because I have come to you from God. I am not here on my own, but he sent me.  43Why can't you understand what I am saying? It is because you are unable to do so!  44For you are the children of your father the Devil, and you love to do the evil things he does. He was a murderer from the beginning and has always hated the truth. There is no truth in him. When he lies, it is consistent with his character; for he is a liar and the father of lies.  45So when I tell the truth, you just naturally don't believe me!  46Which of you can truthfully accuse me of sin? And since I am telling you the truth, why don't you believe me?  47Anyone whose Father is God listens gladly to the words of God. Since you don't, it proves you aren't God's children."48The people retorted, "You Samaritan devil! Didn't we say all along that you were possessed by a demon?"49"No," Jesus said, "I have no demon in me. For I honor my Father--and you dishonor me.  50And though I have no wish to glorify myself, God wants to glorify me. Let him be the judge.  51I assure you, anyone who obeys my teaching will never die!"52The people said, "Now we know you are possessed by a demon. Even Abraham and the prophets died, but you say that those who obey your teaching will never die!  53Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? Are you greater than the prophets, who died? Who do you think you are?"54Jesus answered, "If I am merely boasting about myself, it doesn't count. But it is my Father who says these glorious things about me. You say, `He is our God,'  55but you do not even know him. I know him. If I said otherwise, I would be as great a liar as you! But it is true--I know him and obey him.  56Your ancestor Abraham rejoiced as he looked forward to my coming. He saw it and was glad."57The people said, "You aren't even fifty years old. How can you say you have seen Abraham?[f]"58Jesus answered, "The truth is, I existed before Abraham was even born!"[g]  59At that point they picked up stones to kill him. But Jesus hid himself from them and left the Temple.
