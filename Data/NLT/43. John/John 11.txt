1A man named Lazarus was sick. He lived in Bethany with his sisters, Mary and Martha.  2This is the Mary who poured the expensive perfume on the Lord's feet and wiped them with her hair.[a] Her brother, Lazarus, was sick.  3So the two sisters sent a message to Jesus telling him, "Lord, the one you love is very sick."4But when Jesus heard about it he said, "Lazarus's sickness will not end in death. No, it is for the glory of God. I, the Son of God, will receive glory from this."  5Although Jesus loved Martha, Mary, and Lazarus,  6he stayed where he was for the next two days and did not go to them.  7Finally after two days, he said to his disciples, "Let's go to Judea again."8But his disciples objected. "Teacher," they said, "only a few days ago the Jewish leaders in Judea were trying to kill you. Are you going there again?"9Jesus replied, "There are twelve hours of daylight every day. As long as it is light, people can walk safely. They can see because they have the light of this world.  10Only at night is there danger of stumbling because there is no light."  11Then he said, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but now I will go and wake him up."12The disciples said, "Lord, if he is sleeping, that means he is getting better!"  13They thought Jesus meant Lazarus was having a good night's rest, but Jesus meant Lazarus had died.14Then he told them plainly, "Lazarus is dead.  15And for your sake, I am glad I wasn't there, because this will give you another opportunity to believe in me. Come, let's go see him."16Thomas, nicknamed the Twin,[b] said to his fellow disciples, "Let's go, too--and die with Jesus."17When Jesus arrived at Bethany, he was told that Lazarus had already been in his grave for four days. 18Bethany was only a few miles[c] down the road from Jerusalem,  19and many of the people[d] had come to pay their respects and console Martha and Mary on their loss.  20When Martha got word that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him. But Mary stayed at home.  21Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.  22But even now I know that God will give you whatever you ask."23Jesus told her, "Your brother will rise again."24"Yes," Martha said, "when everyone else rises, on resurrection day."25Jesus told her, "I am the resurrection and the life.[e] Those who believe in me, even though they die like everyone else, will live again.  26They are given eternal life for believing in me and will never perish. Do you believe this, Martha?"27"Yes, Lord," she told him. "I have always believed you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one who has come into the world from God."  28Then she left him and returned to Mary. She called Mary aside from the mourners and told her, "The Teacher is here and wants to see you."  29So Mary immediately went to him.30Now Jesus had stayed outside the village, at the place where Martha met him.  31When the people who were at the house trying to console Mary saw her leave so hastily, they assumed she was going to Lazarus's grave to weep. So they followed her there.  32When Mary arrived and saw Jesus, she fell down at his feet and said, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."33When Jesus saw her weeping and saw the other people wailing with her, he was moved with indignation and was deeply troubled.  34"Where have you put him?" he asked them. They told him, "Lord, come and see."  35Then Jesus wept.  36The people who were standing nearby said, "See how much he loved him."  37But some said, "This man healed a blind man. Why couldn't he keep Lazarus from dying?"38And again Jesus was deeply troubled. Then they came to the grave. It was a cave with a stone rolled across its entrance.  39"Roll the stone aside," Jesus told them. But Martha, the dead man's sister, said, "Lord, by now the smell will be terrible because he has been dead for four days."40Jesus responded, "Didn't I tell you that you will see God's glory if you believe?"  41So they rolled the stone aside. Then Jesus looked up to heaven and said, "Father, thank you for hearing me.  42You always hear me, but I said it out loud for the sake of all these people standing here, so they will believe you sent me." 43Then Jesus shouted, "Lazarus, come out!"  44And Lazarus came out, bound in graveclothes, his face wrapped in a headcloth. Jesus told them, "Unwrap him and let him go!"45Many of the people who were with Mary believed in Jesus when they saw this happen.  46But some went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.  47Then the leading priests and Pharisees called the high council[f] together to discuss the situation. "What are we going to do?" they asked each other. "This man certainly performs many miraculous signs.  48If we leave him alone, the whole nation will follow him, and then the Roman army will come and destroy both our Temple and our nation."49And one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said, "How can you be so stupid?  50Why should the whole nation be destroyed? Let this one man die for the people."51This prophecy that Jesus should die for the entire nation came from Caiaphas in his position as high priest. He didn't think of it himself; he was inspired to say it.  52It was a prediction that Jesus' death would be not for Israel only, but for the gathering together of all the children of God scattered around the world.53So from that time on the Jewish leaders began to plot Jesus' death.  54As a result, Jesus stopped his public ministry among the people and left Jerusalem. He went to a place near the wilderness, to the village of Ephraim, and stayed there with his disciples.55It was now almost time for the celebration of Passover, and many people from the country arrived in Jerusalem several days early so they could go through the cleansing ceremony before the Passover began. 56They wanted to see Jesus, and as they talked in the Temple, they asked each other, "What do you think? Will he come for the Passover?"  57Meanwhile, the leading priests and Pharisees had publicly announced that anyone seeing Jesus must report him immediately so they could arrest him.
