1The next day[a] Jesus' mother was a guest at a wedding celebration in the village of Cana in Galilee.  2Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the celebration.  3The wine supply ran out during the festivities, so Jesus' mother spoke to him about the problem. "They have no more wine," she told him.4"How does that concern you and me?" Jesus asked. "My time has not yet come."5But his mother told the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."6Six stone waterpots were standing there; they were used for Jewish ceremonial purposes and held twenty to thirty gallons[b] each.  7Jesus told the servants, "Fill the jars with water." When the jars had been filled to the brim,  8he said, "Dip some out and take it to the master of ceremonies." So they followed his instructions.9When the master of ceremonies tasted the water that was now wine, not knowing where it had come from (though, of course, the servants knew), he called the bridegroom over.  10"Usually a host serves the best wine first," he said. "Then, when everyone is full and doesn't care, he brings out the less expensive wines. But you have kept the best until now!"11This miraculous sign at Cana in Galilee was Jesus' first display of his glory. And his disciples believed in him.12After the wedding he went to Capernaum for a few days with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples.13It was time for the annual Passover celebration, and Jesus went to Jerusalem.  14In the Temple area he saw merchants selling cattle, sheep, and doves for sacrifices; and he saw money changers behind their counters.  15Jesus made a whip from some ropes and chased them all out of the Temple. He drove out the sheep and oxen, scattered the money changers' coins over the floor, and turned over their tables.  16Then, going over to the people who sold doves, he told them, "Get these things out of here. Don't turn my Father's house into a marketplace!"17Then his disciples remembered this prophecy from the Scriptures: "Passion for God's house burns within me."[c]18"What right do you have to do these things?" the Jewish leaders demanded. "If you have this authority from God, show us a miraculous sign to prove it."19"All right," Jesus replied. "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."20"What!" they exclaimed. "It took forty-six years to build this Temple, and you can do it in three days?" 21But by "this temple," Jesus meant his body.  22After he was raised from the dead, the disciples remembered that he had said this. And they believed both Jesus and the Scriptures.23Because of the miraculous signs he did in Jerusalem at the Passover celebration, many people were convinced that he was indeed the Messiah.  24But Jesus didn't trust them, because he knew what people were really like.  25No one needed to tell him about human nature.
