1Early Sunday morning,[a] while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and found that the stone had been rolled away from the entrance.  2She ran and found Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved. She said, "They have taken the Lord's body out of the tomb, and I don't know where they have put him!"3Peter and the other disciple ran to the tomb to see.  4The other disciple outran Peter and got there first. 5He stooped and looked in and saw the linen cloth lying there, but he didn't go in.  6Then Simon Peter arrived and went inside. He also noticed the linen wrappings lying there,  7while the cloth that had covered Jesus' head was folded up and lying to the side.  8Then the other disciple also went in, and he saw and believed-- 9for until then they hadn't realized that the Scriptures said he would rise from the dead.  10Then they went home.11Mary was standing outside the tomb crying, and as she wept, she stooped and looked in.  12She saw two white-robed angels sitting at the head and foot of the place where the body of Jesus had been lying.  13"Why are you crying?" the angels asked her. "Because they have taken away my Lord," she replied, "and I don't know where they have put him."14She glanced over her shoulder and saw someone standing behind her. It was Jesus, but she didn't recognize him.  15"Why are you crying?" Jesus asked her. "Who are you looking for?" She thought he was the gardener. "Sir," she said, "if you have taken him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will go and get him."16"Mary!" Jesus said. She turned toward him and exclaimed, "Teacher!"[b]17"Don't cling to me," Jesus said, "for I haven't yet ascended to the Father. But go find my brothers and tell them that I am ascending to my Father and your Father, my God and your God."18Mary Magdalene found the disciples and told them, "I have seen the Lord!" Then she gave them his message.19That evening, on the first day of the week, the disciples were meeting behind locked doors because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. Suddenly, Jesus was standing there among them! "Peace be with you," he said.  20As he spoke, he held out his hands for them to see, and he showed them his side. They were filled with joy when they saw their Lord!  21He spoke to them again and said, "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you."  22Then he breathed on them and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit.  23If you forgive anyone's sins, they are forgiven. If you refuse to forgive them, they are unforgiven."24One of the disciples, Thomas (nicknamed the Twin[c]), was not with the others when Jesus came.  25They told him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he replied, "I won't believe it unless I see the nail wounds in his hands, put my fingers into them, and place my hand into the wound in his side."26Eight days later the disciples were together again, and this time Thomas was with them. The doors were locked; but suddenly, as before, Jesus was standing among them. He said, "Peace be with you."  27Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand into the wound in my side. Don't be faithless any longer. Believe!"28"My Lord and my God!" Thomas exclaimed.29Then Jesus told him, "You believe because you have seen me. Blessed are those who haven't seen me and believe anyway."30Jesus' disciples saw him do many other miraculous signs besides the ones recorded in this book.  31But these are written so that you may believe[d] that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing in him you will have life.
