[Good and Bad Figs] 1 After King Nebuchadnezzar[a] of Babylon exiled Jehoiachin[b] son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, to Babylon along with the officials of Judah and all the craftsmen and artisans, the Lord  gave me this vision. I saw two baskets of figs placed in front of the Lord 's Temple in Jerusalem. 2 One basket was filled with fresh, ripe figs, while the other was filled with bad figs that were too rotten to eat.3 Then the Lord  said to me, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" I replied, "Figs, some very good and some very bad, too rotten to eat."4 Then the Lord  gave me this message: 5 "This is what the Lord , the God of Israel, says: The good figs represent the exiles I sent from Judah to the land of the Babylonians.[c] 6 I will watch over and care for them, and I will bring them back here again. I will build them up and not tear them down. I will plant them and not uproot them. 7 I will give them hearts that recognize me as the Lord . They will be my people, and I will be their God, for they will return to me wholeheartedly.8 "But the bad figs," the Lord  said, "represent King Zedekiah of Judah, his officials, all the people left in Jerusalem, and those who live in Egypt. I will treat them like bad figs, too rotten to eat. 9 I will make them an object of horror and a symbol of evil to every nation on earth. They will be disgraced and mocked, taunted and cursed, wherever I scatter them. 10 And I will send war, famine, and disease until they have vanished from the land of Israel, which I gave to them and their ancestors."       Footnotes:a.   24:1a Hebrew Nebuchadrezzar, a variant spelling of Nebuchadnezzar.  b.   24:1b Hebrew Jeconiah, a variant spelling of Jehoiachin.  c.   24:5 Or Chaldeans.
