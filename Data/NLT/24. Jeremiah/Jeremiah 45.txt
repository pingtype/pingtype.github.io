1The prophet Jeremiah gave a message to Baruch son of Neriah in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah,[a] after Baruch had written down everything Jeremiah had dictated to him. He said,  2"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch:  3You have said, `I am overwhelmed with trouble! Haven't I had enough pain already? And now the LORD has added more! I am weary of my own sighing and can find no rest.'4"Baruch, this is what the LORD says: I will destroy this nation that I built. I will uproot what I planted. 5Are you seeking great things for yourself? Don't do it! But don't be discouraged. I will bring great disaster upon all these people, but I will protect you wherever you go. I, the LORD, have spoken!"
