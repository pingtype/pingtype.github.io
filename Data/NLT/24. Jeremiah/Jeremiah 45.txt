[A Message for Baruch] 1 The prophet Jeremiah gave a message to Baruch son of Neriah in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah,[a] after Baruch had written down everything Jeremiah had dictated to him. He said, 2 "This is what the Lord , the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch: 3 You have said, "I am overwhelmed with trouble! Haven't I had enough pain already? And now the Lord  has added more! I am worn out from sighing and can find no rest.'4 "Baruch, this is what the Lord  says: "I will destroy this nation that I built. I will uproot what I planted. 5 Are you seeking great things for yourself? Don't do it! I will bring great disaster upon all these people; but I will give you your life as a reward wherever you go. I, the Lord , have spoken!'"       Footnotes:a.   45:1 The fourth year of Jehoiakim's reign was 605 b.c.
