1King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came with all the armies from the kingdoms he ruled, and he fought against Jerusalem and the towns of Judah. At that time this message came to Jeremiah from the LORD:  2"Go to King Zedekiah of Judah, and tell him, `This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will burn it.  3You will not escape his grasp but will be taken into captivity. You will stand before the king of Babylon to be judged and sentenced. Then you will be exiled to Babylon.'4"But listen to this promise from the LORD, O Zedekiah, king of Judah. This is what the LORD says: `You will not be killed in war  5but will die peacefully among your people. They will burn incense in your memory, just as they did for your ancestors. They will weep for you and say, "Alas, our king is dead!" This I have decreed, says the LORD.' "6So Jeremiah the prophet delivered the message to King Zedekiah of Judah.  7At this time the Babylonian army was besieging Jerusalem, Lachish, and Azekah--the only cities of Judah with their walls still standing.8This message came to Jeremiah from the LORD after King Zedekiah made a covenant with the people, proclaiming freedom for the slaves.  9He had ordered all the people to free their Hebrew slaves--both men and women. No one was to keep a fellow Judean in bondage.  10The officials and all the people had obeyed the king's command,  11but later they changed their minds. They took back the people they had freed, making them slaves again.12So the LORD gave them this message through Jeremiah:  13"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your ancestors long ago when I rescued them from their slavery in Egypt.  14I told them that every Hebrew slave must be freed after serving six years. But this was never done.  15Recently you repented and did what was right, following my command. You freed your slaves and made a solemn covenant with me in my Temple.  16But now you have shrugged off your oath and defiled my name by taking back the men and women you had freed, making them slaves once again.17"Therefore, this is what the LORD says: Since you have not obeyed me by setting your countrymen free, I will set you free to be destroyed by war, famine, and disease. You will be considered a disgrace by all the nations of the earth.  18Because you have refused the terms of our covenant, I will cut you apart just as you cut apart the calf when you walked between its halves to solemnize your vows.  19Yes, I will cut you apart, whether you are officials of Judah or Jerusalem, court officials, priests, or common people--for you have broken your oath.  20I will give you to your enemies, and they will kill you. Your bodies will be food for the vultures and wild animals.  21I will hand over King Zedekiah of Judah and his officials to the army of the king of Babylon. And though Babylon's king has left this city for a while,  22I will call the Babylonian armies back again. They will fight against this city and will capture and burn it. I will see to it that all the towns of Judah are destroyed and left completely empty."
