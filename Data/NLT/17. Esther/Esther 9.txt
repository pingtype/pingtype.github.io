1So on March 7[a] the two decrees of the king were put into effect. On that day, the enemies of the Jews had hoped to destroy them, but quite the opposite happened.  2The Jews gathered in their cities throughout all the king's provinces to defend themselves against anyone who might try to harm them. But no one could make a stand against them, for everyone was afraid of them.  3And all the commanders of the provinces, the princes, the governors, and the royal officials helped the Jews for fear of Mordecai.  4For Mordecai had been promoted in the king's palace, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces as he became more and more powerful.5But the Jews went ahead on the appointed day and struck down their enemies with the sword. They killed and annihilated their enemies and did as they pleased with those who hated them.  6They killed five hundred people in the fortress of Susa.  7They also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,  8Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, 9Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha--  10the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. But they did not take any plunder.11That evening, when the king was informed of the number of people killed in the fortress of Susa,  12he called for Queen Esther and said, "The Jews have killed five hundred people in the fortress of Susa alone and also Haman's ten sons. If they have done that here, what has happened in the rest of the provinces? But now, what more do you want? It will be granted to you; tell me and I will do it."13And Esther said, "If it please Your Majesty, give the Jews in Susa permission to do again tomorrow as they have done today, and have the bodies of Haman's ten sons hung from the gallows.[b]"14So the king agreed, and the decree was announced in Susa. They also hung the bodies of Haman's ten sons from the gallows.  15Then the Jews at Susa gathered together on March 8[c] and killed three hundred more people, though again they took no plunder.16Meanwhile, the other Jews throughout the king's provinces had gathered together to defend their lives. They gained relief from all their enemies, killing seventy-five thousand of those who hated them. But they did not take any plunder.  17Throughout the provinces this was done on March 7.[d] Then on the following day[e] they rested, celebrating their victory with a day of feasting and gladness.  18But the Jews at Susa continued killing their enemies on the second day also, and then rested on the third day,[f] making that their day of feasting and gladness.  19So to this day, rural Jews living in unwalled villages celebrate an annual festival and holiday in late winter,[g] when they rejoice and send gifts to each other.20Mordecai recorded these events and sent letters to the Jews near and far, throughout all the king's provinces,  21encouraging them to celebrate an annual festival on these two days.  22He told them to celebrate these days with feasting and gladness and by giving gifts to each other and to the poor. This would commemorate a time when the Jews gained relief from their enemies, when their sorrow was turned into gladness and their mourning into joy.23So the Jews adopted Mordecai's suggestion and began this annual custom.  24Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews, had plotted to crush and destroy them on the day and month determined by casting lots (the lots were called purim).  25But when Esther came before the king, he issued a decree causing Haman's evil plot to backfire, and Haman and his sons were hanged on the gallows. 26(That is why this celebration is called Purim, because it is the ancient word for casting lots.) So because of Mordecai's letter and because of what they had experienced,  27the Jews throughout the realm agreed to inaugurate this tradition and to pass it on to their descendants and to all who became Jews. They declared they would never fail to celebrate these two prescribed days at the appointed time each year.  28These days would be remembered and kept from generation to generation and celebrated by every family throughout the provinces and cities of the empire. These days would never cease to be celebrated among the Jews, nor would the memory of what happened ever die out among their descendants.29Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote another letter putting the queen's full authority behind Mordecai's letter to establish the Festival of Purim.  30In addition, letters wishing peace and security were sent to the Jews throughout the 127 provinces of the empire of Xerxes. 31These letters established the Festival of Purim--an annual celebration of these days at the appointed time, decreed by both Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther. (The people decided to observe this festival, just as they had decided for themselves and their descendants to establish the times of fasting and mourning.)  32So the command of Esther confirmed the practices of Purim, and it was all written down in the records.
