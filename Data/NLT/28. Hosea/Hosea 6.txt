[A Call to Repentance] 1 "Come, let us return to the Lord . He has torn us to pieces; now he will heal us. He has injured us; now he will bandage our wounds.2 In just a short time he will restore us, so that we may live in his presence.3 Oh, that we might know the Lord ! Let us press on to know him. He will respond to us as surely as the arrival of dawn or the coming of rains in early spring."4 "O Israel[a] and Judah, what should I do with you?" asks the Lord . "For your love vanishes like the morning mist and disappears like dew in the sunlight.5 I sent my prophets to cut you to pieces- to slaughter you with my words, with judgments as inescapable as light.6 I want you to show love,[b]not offer sacrifices. I want you to know me[c]more than I want burnt offerings.7 But like Adam,[d] you broke my covenant and betrayed my trust.8 "Gilead is a city of sinners, tracked with footprints of blood.9 Priests form bands of robbers, waiting in ambush for their victims. They murder travelers along the road to Shechem and practice every kind of sin.10 Yes, I have seen something horrible in Ephraim and Israel: My people are defiled by prostituting themselves with other gods!11 "O Judah, a harvest of punishment is also waiting for you, though I wanted to restore the fortunes of my people.       Footnotes:a.   6:4 Hebrew Ephraim, referring to the northern kingdom of Israel.  b.   6:6a Greek version translates this Hebrew term as to show mercy.
