1Then the LORD said to me, "Go and get your wife again. Bring her back to you and love her, even though she loves adultery. For the LORD still loves Israel even though the people have turned to other gods, offering them choice gifts.[a]"2So I bought her back for fifteen pieces of silver[b] and about five bushels of barley and a measure of wine.[c]  3Then I said to her, "You must live in my house for many days and stop your prostitution. During this time, you will not have sexual intercourse with anyone, not even with me.[d]"4This illustrates that Israel will be a long time without a king or prince, and without sacrifices, temple, priests, or even idols!  5But afterward the people will return to the LORD their God and to David's descendant, their king.[e] They will come trembling in awe to the LORD, and they will receive his good gifts in the last days.
