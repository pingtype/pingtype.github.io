[Hosea Announces Israel's Punishment] 1 O people of Israel, do not rejoice as other nations do. For you have been unfaithful to your God, hiring yourselves out like prostitutes, worshiping other gods on every threshing floor.2 So now your harvests will be too small to feed you. There will be no grapes for making new wine.3 You may no longer stay here in the Lord 's land. Instead, you will return to Egypt, and in Assyria you will eat food that is ceremonially unclean.4 There you will make no offerings of wine to the Lord . None of your sacrifices there will please him. They will be unclean, like food touched by a person in mourning. All who present such sacrifices will be defiled. They may eat this food themselves, but they may not offer it to the Lord .5 What then will you do on festival days? How will you observe the Lord 's festivals?6 Even if you escape destruction from Assyria, Egypt will conquer you, and Memphis* will bury you. Nettles will take over your treasures of silver; thistles will invade your ruined homes.7 The time of Israel's punishment has come; the day of payment is here. Soon Israel will know this all too well. Because of your great sin and hostility, you say, "The prophets are crazy and the inspired men are fools!"8 The prophet is a watchman over Israel* for my God, yet traps are laid for him wherever he goes. He faces hostility even in the house of God.9 The things my people do are as depraved as what they did in Gibeah long ago. God will not forget. He will surely punish them for their sins.10 The Lord  says, "O Israel, when I first found you, it was like finding fresh grapes in the desert. When I saw your ancestors, it was like seeing the first ripe figs of the season. But then they deserted me for Baal-peor, giving themselves to that shameful idol. Soon they became vile, as vile as the god they worshiped.11 The glory of Israel will fly away like a bird, for your children will not be born or grow in the womb or even be conceived.12 Even if you do have children who grow up, I will take them from you. It will be a terrible day when I turn away and leave you alone.13 I have watched Israel become as beautiful as Tyre. But now Israel will bring out her children for slaughter."14 O Lord , what should I request for your people? I will ask for wombs that don't give birth and breasts that give no milk.15 The Lord  says, "All their wickedness began at Gilgal; there I began to hate them. I will drive them from my land because of their evil actions. I will love them no more because all their leaders are rebels.16 The people of Israel are struck down. Their roots are dried up, and they will bear no more fruit. And if they give birth, I will slaughter their beloved children."17 My God will reject the people of Israel because they will not listen or obey. They will be wanderers, homeless among the nations.       Footnotes: 9:6 Memphis was the capital of northern Egypt.   9:8 Hebrew Ephraim, referring to the northern kingdom of Israel; also in 9:11, 13, 16.
