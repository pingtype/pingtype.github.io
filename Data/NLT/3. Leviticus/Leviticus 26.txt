1"Do not make idols or set up carved images, sacred pillars, or shaped stones to be worshiped in your land. I, the LORD, am your God.  2You must keep my Sabbath days of rest and show reverence for my sanctuary. I am the LORD.3"If you keep my laws and are careful to obey my commands,  4I will send the seasonal rains. The land will then yield its crops, and the trees will produce their fruit.  5Your threshing season will extend until the grape harvest, and your grape harvest will extend until it is time to plant grain again. You will eat your fill and live securely in your land.6"I will give you peace in the land, and you will be able to sleep without fear. I will remove the wild animals from your land and protect you from your enemies.  7In fact, you will chase down all your enemies and slaughter them with your swords.  8Five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand! All your enemies will fall beneath the blows of your weapons.9"I will look favorably upon you and multiply your people and fulfill my covenant with you.  10You will have such a surplus of crops that you will need to get rid of the leftovers from the previous year to make room for each new harvest.  11I will live among you, and I will not despise you.  12I will walk among you; I will be your God, and you will be my people.  13I, the LORD, am your God, who brought you from the land of Egypt so you would no longer be slaves. I have lifted the yoke of slavery from your neck so you can walk free with your heads held high.14"However, if you do not listen to me or obey my commands,  15and if you break my covenant by rejecting my laws and treating my regulations with contempt,  16I will punish you. You will suffer from sudden terrors, with wasting diseases, and with burning fevers, causing your eyes to fail and your life to ebb away. You will plant your crops in vain because your enemies will eat them.  17I will turn against you, and you will be defeated by all your enemies. They will rule over you, and you will run even when no one is chasing you!18"And if, in spite of this, you still disobey me, I will punish you for your sins seven times over.  19I will break down your arrogant spirit by making the skies above as unyielding as iron and the earth beneath as hard as bronze.  20All your work will be for nothing, for your land will yield no crops, and your trees will bear no fruit.21"If even then you remain hostile toward me and refuse to obey, I will inflict you with seven more disasters for your sins.  22I will release wild animals that will kill your children and destroy your cattle, so your numbers will dwindle and your roads will be deserted.23"And if you fail to learn a lesson from this and continue your hostility toward me,  24then I myself will be hostile toward you, and I will personally strike you seven times over for your sins.  25I will send armies against you to carry out these covenant threats. If you flee to your cities, I will send a plague to destroy you there, and you will be conquered by your enemies.  26I will completely destroy your food supply, so the bread from one oven will have to be stretched to feed ten families. They will ration your food by weight, and even if you have food to eat, you will not be satisfied.27"If after this you still refuse to listen and still remain hostile toward me,  28then I will give full vent to my hostility. I will punish you seven times over for your sins.  29You will eat the flesh of your own sons and daughters.  30I will destroy your pagan shrines and cut down your incense altars. I will leave your corpses piled up beside your lifeless idols, and I will despise you.  31I will make your cities desolate and destroy your places of worship, and I will take no pleasure in your offerings of incense.  32Yes, I myself will devastate your land. Your enemies who come to occupy it will be utterly shocked at the destruction they see.  33I will scatter you among the nations and attack you with my own weapons. Your land will become desolate, and your cities will lie in ruins.  34Then at last the land will make up for its missed Sabbath years as it lies desolate during your years of exile in the land of your enemies. Then the land will finally rest and enjoy its Sabbaths.  35As the land lies in ruins, it will take the rest you never allowed it to take every seventh year while you lived in it.36"And for those of you who survive, I will demoralize you in the land of your enemies far away. You will live there in such constant fear that the sound of a leaf driven by the wind will send you fleeing. You will run as though chased by a warrior with a sword, and you will fall even when no one is pursuing you.  37Yes, though no one is chasing you, you will stumble over each other in flight, as though fleeing in battle. You will have no power to stand before your enemies.  38You will die among the foreign nations and be devoured in the land of your enemies.  39Those still left alive will rot away in enemy lands because of their sins and the sins of their ancestors.40"But at last my people will confess their sins and the sins of their ancestors for betraying me and being hostile toward me.  41Finally, when I have given full expression to my hostility and have brought them to the land of their enemies, then at last their disobedient hearts will be humbled, and they will pay for their sins. 42Then I will remember my covenant with Jacob, with Isaac, and with Abraham, and I will remember the land.  43And the land will enjoy its years of Sabbath rest as it lies deserted. At last the people will receive the due punishment for their sins, for they rejected my regulations and despised my laws.44"But despite all this, I will not utterly reject or despise them while they are in exile in the land of their enemies. I will not cancel my covenant with them by wiping them out. I, the LORD, am their God.  45I will remember my ancient covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of Egypt while all the nations watched. I, the LORD, am their God."46These are the laws, regulations, and instructions that the LORD gave to the Israelites through Moses on Mount Sinai.
