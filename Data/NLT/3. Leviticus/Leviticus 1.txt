1The LORD called to Moses from the Tabernacle[a] and said to him,   2"Give the following instructions to the Israelites: Whenever you present offerings to the LORD, you must bring animals from your flocks and herds.3"If your sacrifice for a whole burnt offering is from the herd, bring a bull with no physical defects to the entrance of the Tabernacle so it will be accepted by the LORD.   4Lay your hand on its head so the LORD will accept it as your substitute, thus making atonement for you.   5Then slaughter the animal in the LORD's presence, and Aaron's sons, the priests, will present the blood by sprinkling it against the sides of the altar that stands in front of the Tabernacle.   6When the animal has been skinned and cut into pieces,   7the sons of Aaron the priest will build a wood fire on the altar.   8Aaron's sons will then put the pieces of the animal, including its head and fat, on the wood fire.   9But the internal organs and legs must first be washed with water. Then the priests will burn the entire sacrifice on the altar. It is a whole burnt offering made by fire, very pleasing to the LORD.10"If your sacrifice for a whole burnt offering is from the flock, bring a male sheep or goat with no physical defects.   11Slaughter the animal on the north side of the altar in the LORD's presence. Aaron's sons, the priests, will sprinkle its blood against the sides of the altar.   12Then you must cut the animal in pieces, and the priests will lay the pieces of the sacrifice, including the head and fat, on top of the wood fire on the altar.   13The internal organs and legs must first be washed with water. Then the priests will burn the entire sacrifice on the altar. It is a whole burnt offering made by fire, very pleasing to the LORD.14"If you bring a bird as a burnt offering to the LORD, choose either a turtledove or a young pigeon.   15The priest will take the bird to the altar, twist off its head, and burn the head on the altar. He must then let its blood drain out against the sides of the altar.   16The priest must remove the crop and the feathers[b] and throw them to the east side of the altar among the ashes.   17Then, grasping the bird by its wings, the priest will tear the bird apart, though not completely. Then he will burn it on top of the wood fire on the altar. It is a whole burnt offering made by fire, very pleasing to the LORD.
