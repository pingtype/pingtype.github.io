1"If you want to present a peace offering from the herd, use either a bull or a cow. The animal you offer to the LORD must have no physical defects.  2Lay your hand on the animal's head, and slaughter it at the entrance of the Tabernacle.[a] Aaron's sons, the priests, will then sprinkle the animal's blood against the sides of the altar.  3Part of this peace offering must be presented to the LORD as an offering made by fire. This includes the fat around the internal organs,  4the two kidneys with the fat around them near the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which is to be removed with the kidneys.  5The sons of Aaron will burn these on the altar on top of the burnt offering on the wood fire. It is an offering made by fire, very pleasing to the LORD.6"If you present a peace offering to the LORD from the flock, you may bring either a goat or a sheep.
