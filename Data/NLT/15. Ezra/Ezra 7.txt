1Many years later, during the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia,[a] there was a man named Ezra. He was the son[b] of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah,  2son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub,  3son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son[c] of Meraioth,  4son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki,  5son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the high priest.  6This Ezra was a scribe, well versed in the law of Moses, which the LORD, the God of Israel, had given to the people of Israel. He came up to Jerusalem from Babylon, and the king gave him everything he asked for, because the gracious hand of the LORD his God was on him.  7Some of the people of Israel, as well as some of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and Temple servants, traveled up to Jerusalem with him in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes' reign.8Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in August[d] of that year.  9He had left Babylon on April 8[e] and came to Jerusalem on August 4,[f] for the gracious hand of his God was on him.  10This was because Ezra had determined to study and obey the law of the LORD and to teach those laws and regulations to the people of Israel.11King Artaxerxes had given a copy of the following letter to Ezra, the priest and scribe who studied and taught the commands and laws of the LORD to Israel:12"Greetings[g] from Artaxerxes, the king of kings, to Ezra the priest, the teacher of the law of the God of heaven.13"I decree that any of the people of Israel in my kingdom, including the priests and Levites, may volunteer to return to Jerusalem with you.  14I and my Council of Seven hereby instruct you to conduct an inquiry into the situation in Judah and Jerusalem, based on your God's law, which is in your hand.  15We also commission you to take with you some silver and gold, which we are freely presenting as an offering to the God of Israel who lives in Jerusalem.16"Moreover you are to take any silver and gold which you may obtain from the province of Babylon, as well as the freewill offerings of the people and the priests that are presented for the Temple of their God in Jerusalem.  17These donations are to be used specifically for the purchase of bulls, rams, lambs, and the appropriate grain offerings and drink offerings, all of which will be offered on the altar of the Temple of your God in Jerusalem.  18Any money that is left over may be used in whatever way you and your colleagues feel is the will of your God.  19But as for the utensils we are entrusting to you for the service of the Temple of your God, deliver them in full to the God of Jerusalem.  20If you run short of money for anything necessary for your God's Temple or for any similar needs, you may requisition funds from the royal treasury.21"I, Artaxerxes the king, hereby send this decree to all the treasurers in the province west of the Euphrates River: `You are to give Ezra whatever he requests of you, for he is a priest and teacher of the law of the God of heaven.  22You are to give him up to 7,500 pounds[h] of silver, 500 bushels[i] of wheat, 550 gallons of wine, 550 gallons of olive oil,[j] and an unlimited supply of salt.  23Be careful to provide whatever the God of heaven demands for his Temple, for why should we risk bringing God's anger against the realm of the king and his sons?  24I also decree that no priest, Levite, singer, gatekeeper, Temple servant, or other worker in this Temple of God will be required to pay taxes of any kind.'25"And you, Ezra, are to use the wisdom God has given you to appoint magistrates and judges who know your God's laws to govern all the people in the province west of the Euphrates River. If the people are not familiar with those laws, you must teach them.  26Anyone who refuses to obey the law of your God and the law of the king will be punished immediately by death, banishment, confiscation of goods, or imprisonment."27Praise the LORD, the God of our ancestors, who made the king want to beautify the Temple of the LORD in Jerusalem!  28And praise him for demonstrating such unfailing love to me by honoring me before the king, his council, and all his mighty princes! I felt encouraged because the gracious hand of the LORD my God was on me. And I gathered some of the leaders of Israel to return with me to Jerusalem.
