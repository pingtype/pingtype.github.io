[Exiles Who Returned with Zerubbabel] 1 Here is the list of the Jewish exiles of the provinces who returned from their captivity. King Nebuchadnezzar had deported them to Babylon, but now they returned to Jerusalem and the other towns in Judah where they originally lived. 2 Their leaders were Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah. This is the number of the men of Israel who returned from exile:               3 The family of Parosh         2,172               4 The family of Shephatiah         372               5 The family of Arah         775               6 The family of Pahath-moab (descendants of Jeshua and Joab)         2,812               7 The family of Elam         1,254               8 The family of Zattu         945               9 The family of Zaccai         760               10 The family of Bani         642               11 The family of Bebai         623               12 The family of Azgad         1,222               13 The family of Adonikam         666               14 The family of Bigvai         2,056               15 The family of Adin         454               16 The family of Ater (descendants of Hezekiah)         98               17 The family of Bezai         323               18 The family of Jorah         112               19 The family of Hashum         223               20 The family of Gibbar         95               21 The people of Bethlehem         123               22 The people of Netophah         56               23 The people of Anathoth         128               24 The people of Beth-azmaveth[a]42               25 The people of Kiriath-jearim,[b]Kephirah, and Beeroth         743               26 The people of Ramah and Geba         621               27 The people of Micmash         122               28 The people of Bethel and Ai         223               29 The citizens of Nebo         52               30 The citizens of Magbish         156               31 The citizens of West Elam[c]1,254               32 The citizens of Harim         320               33 The citizens of Lod, Hadid, and Ono         725               34 The citizens of Jericho         345               35 The citizens of Senaah         3,63036 These are the priests who returned from exile:               The family of Jedaiah (through the line of Jeshua)         973               37 The family of Immer         1,052               38 The family of Pashhur         1,247               39 The family of Harim         1,01740 These are the Levites who returned from exile:               The families of Jeshua and Kadmiel (descendants of Hodaviah)         74               41 The singers of the family of Asaph         128               42 The gatekeepers of the families of Shallum, Ater, Talmon, Akkub, Hatita, and Shobai         13943 The descendants of the following Temple servants returned from exile: Ziha, Hasupha, Tabbaoth,44 Keros, Siaha, Padon,45 Lebanah, Hagabah, Akkub,46 Hagab, Shalmai,[d] Hanan,47 Giddel, Gahar, Reaiah,48 Rezin, Nekoda, Gazzam,49 Uzza, Paseah, Besai,50 Asnah, Meunim, Nephusim,51 Bakbuk, Hakupha, Harhur,52 Bazluth, Mehida, Harsha,53 Barkos, Sisera, Temah,54 Neziah, and Hatipha.55 The descendants of these servants of King Solomon returned from exile: Sotai, Hassophereth, Peruda,56 Jaalah, Darkon, Giddel,57 Shephatiah, Hattil, Pokereth-hazzebaim, and Ami.58 In all, the Temple servants and the descendants of Solomon's servants numbered 392.59 Another group returned at this time from the towns of Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Kerub, Addan, and Immer. However, they could not prove that they or their families were descendants of Israel. 60 This group included the families of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda-a total of 652 people.61 Three families of priests-Hobaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai-also returned. (This Barzillai had married a woman who was a descendant of Barzillai of Gilead, and he had taken her family name.) 62 They searched for their names in the genealogical records, but they were not found, so they were disqualified from serving as priests. 63 The governor told them not to eat the priests' share of food from the sacrifices until a priest could consult the Lord  about the matter by using the Urim and Thummim-the sacred lots.64 So a total of 42,360 people returned to Judah, 65 in addition to 7,337 servants and 200 singers, both men and women. 66 They took with them 736 horses, 245 mules, 67 435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.68 When they arrived at the Temple of the Lord  in Jerusalem, some of the family leaders made voluntary offerings toward the rebuilding of God's Temple on its original site, 69 and each leader gave as much as he could. The total of their gifts came to 61,000 gold coins,[e] 6,250 pounds[f] of silver, and 100 robes for the priests.70 So the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, the Temple servants, and some of the common people settled in villages near Jerusalem. The rest of the people returned to their own towns throughout Israel.       Footnotes:a.   2:24 As in parallel text at Neh 7:28; Hebrew reads Azmaveth.          b.   2:25 As in some Hebrew manuscripts and Greek version (see also Neh 7:29); Hebrew reads Kiriath-arim.  c.   2:31 Or of the other Elam.          d.   2:46 As in an alternate reading of the Masoretic Text (see also Neh 7:48); the other alternate reads Shamlai.  e.   2:69a Hebrew 61,000 darics of gold, about 1,100 pounds or 500 kilograms in weight.  f.   2:69b Hebrew 5,000 minas [3,000 kilograms].
