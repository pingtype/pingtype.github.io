1Here is the list of the Jewish exiles of the provinces who returned from their captivity to Jerusalem and to the other towns of Judah. They had been deported to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar.  2Their leaders were Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah.

However, they could not prove that they or their families were descendants of Israel. 60This group consisted of the families of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda--a total of 652 people.61Three families of priests--Hobaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai--also returned to Jerusalem. (This Barzillai had married a woman who was a descendant of Barzillai of Gilead, and he had taken her family name.)  62But they had lost their genealogical records, so they were not allowed to serve as priests.  63The governor would not even let them eat the priests' share of food from the sacrifices until there was a priest who could consult the LORD about the matter by means of sacred lots.[e]64So a total of 42,360 people returned to Judah,  65in addition to 7,337 servants and 200 singers, both men and women.  66They took with them 736 horses, 245 mules,  67435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.68When they arrived at the Temple of the LORD in Jerusalem, some of the family leaders gave generously toward the rebuilding of God's Temple on its original site,  69and each leader gave as much as he could. The total of their gifts came to 61,000 gold coins,[f] 6,250 pounds[g] of silver, and 100 robes for the priests.70So the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, the Temple servants, and some of the common people settled in villages near Jerusalem. The rest of the people returned to the other towns of Judah from which they had come.
