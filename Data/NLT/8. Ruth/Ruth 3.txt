1One day Naomi said to Ruth, "My daughter, it's time that I found a permanent home for you, so that you will be provided for.  2Boaz is a close relative of ours, and he's been very kind by letting you gather grain with his workers. Tonight he will be winnowing barley at the threshing floor.  3Now do as I tell you--take a bath and put on perfume and dress in your nicest clothes. Then go to the threshing floor, but don't let Boaz see you until he has finished his meal.  4Be sure to notice where he lies down; then go and uncover his feet and lie down there. He will tell you what to do."5"I will do everything you say," Ruth replied.  6So she went down to the threshing floor that night and followed the instructions of her mother-in-law.7After Boaz had finished his meal and was in good spirits, he lay down beside the heap of grain and went to sleep. Then Ruth came quietly, uncovered his feet, and lay down.  8Around midnight, Boaz suddenly woke up and turned over. He was surprised to find a woman lying at his feet!  9"Who are you?" he demanded. "I am your servant Ruth," she replied. "Spread the corner of your covering over me, for you are my family redeemer."10"The LORD bless you, my daughter!" Boaz exclaimed. "You are showing more family loyalty now than ever by not running after a younger man, whether rich or poor.  11Now don't worry about a thing, my daughter. I will do what is necessary, for everyone in town knows you are an honorable woman.  12But there is one problem. While it is true that I am one of your family redeemers, there is another man who is more closely related to you than I am.  13Stay here tonight, and in the morning I will talk to him. If he is willing to redeem you, then let him marry you. But if he is not willing, then as surely as the LORD lives, I will marry you! Now lie down here until morning."14So Ruth lay at Boaz's feet until the morning, but she got up before it was light enough for people to recognize each other. For Boaz said, "No one must know that a woman was here at the threshing floor." 
15Boaz also said to her, "Bring your cloak and spread it out." He measured out six scoops[a] of barley into the cloak and helped her put it on her back. Then Boaz[b] returned to the town.16When Ruth went back to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, "What happened, my daughter?" Ruth told Naomi everything Boaz had done for her,  17and she added, "He gave me these six scoops of barley and said, `Don't go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.' "18Then Naomi said to her, "Just be patient, my daughter, until we hear what happens. The man won't rest until he has followed through on this. He will settle it today."
