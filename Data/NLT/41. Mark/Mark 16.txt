1The next evening, when the Sabbath ended, Mary Magdalene and Salome and Mary the mother of James went out and purchased burial spices to put on Jesus' body.  2Very early on Sunday morning,[a] just at sunrise, they came to the tomb.  3On the way they were discussing who would roll the stone away from the entrance to the tomb.  4But when they arrived, they looked up and saw that the stone--a very large one--had already been rolled aside.  5So they entered the tomb, and there on the right sat a young man clothed in a white robe. The women were startled,  6but the angel said, "Do not be so surprised. You are looking for Jesus, the Nazarene, who was crucified. He isn't here! He has been raised from the dead! Look, this is where they laid his body.  7Now go and give this message to his disciples, including Peter: Jesus is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there, just as he told you before he died!"  8The women fled from the tomb, trembling and bewildered, saying nothing to anyone because they were too frightened to talk.[b] [Shorter Ending of Mark] Then they reported all these instructions briefly to Peter and his companions. Afterward Jesus himself sent them out from east to west with the sacred and unfailing message of salvation that gives eternal life. Amen.9 [Longer Ending of Mark] It was early on Sunday morning when Jesus rose from the dead, and the first person who saw him was Mary Magdalene, the woman from whom he had cast out seven demons.  10She went and found the disciples, who were grieving and weeping.  11But when she told them that Jesus was alive and she had seen him, they didn't believe her.12Afterward he appeared to two who were walking from Jerusalem into the country, but they didn't recognize him at first because he had changed his appearance.  13When they realized who he was, they rushed back to tell the others, but no one believed them.14Still later he appeared to the eleven disciples as they were eating together. He rebuked them for their unbelief--their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen.15And then he told them, "Go into all the world and preach the Good News to everyone, everywhere. 16Anyone who believes and is baptized will be saved. But anyone who refuses to believe will be condemned. 17These signs will accompany those who believe: They will cast out demons in my name, and they will speak new languages.[c]  18They will be able to handle snakes with safety, and if they drink anything poisonous, it won't hurt them. They will be able to place their hands on the sick and heal them."19When the Lord Jesus had finished talking with them, he was taken up into heaven and sat down in the place of honor at God's right hand.  20And the disciples went everywhere and preached, and the Lord worked with them, confirming what they said by many miraculous signs.
