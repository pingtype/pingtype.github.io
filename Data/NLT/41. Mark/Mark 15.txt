1Very early in the morning the leading priests, other leaders, and teachers of religious law--the entire high council[a]--met to discuss their next step. They bound Jesus and took him to Pilate, the Roman governor.2Pilate asked Jesus, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus replied, "Yes, it is as you say."3Then the leading priests accused him of many crimes,  4and Pilate asked him, "Aren't you going to say something? What about all these charges against you?"  5But Jesus said nothing, much to Pilate's surprise.6Now it was the governor's custom to release one prisoner each year at Passover time--anyone the people requested.  7One of the prisoners at that time was Barabbas, convicted along with others for murder during an insurrection.  8The mob began to crowd in toward Pilate, asking him to release a prisoner as usual. 9"Should I give you the King of the Jews?" Pilate asked.  10(For he realized by now that the leading priests had arrested Jesus out of envy.)  11But at this point the leading priests stirred up the mob to demand the release of Barabbas instead of Jesus.  12"But if I release Barabbas," Pilate asked them, "what should I do with this man you call the King of the Jews?"13They shouted back, "Crucify him!"14"Why?" Pilate demanded. "What crime has he committed?" But the crowd only roared the louder, "Crucify him!"15So Pilate, anxious to please the crowd, released Barabbas to them. He ordered Jesus flogged with a lead-tipped whip, then turned him over to the Roman soldiers to crucify him.16The soldiers took him into their headquarters[b] and called out the entire battalion.  17They dressed him in a purple robe and made a crown of long, sharp thorns and put it on his head.  18Then they saluted, yelling, "Hail! King of the Jews!"  19And they beat him on the head with a stick, spit on him, and dropped to their knees in mock worship.  20When they were finally tired of mocking him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him again. Then they led him away to be crucified.21A man named Simon, who was from Cyrene,[c] was coming in from the country just then, and they forced him to carry Jesus' cross. (Simon is the father of Alexander and Rufus.)  22And they brought Jesus to a place called Golgotha (which means Skull Hill).  23They offered him wine drugged with myrrh, but he refused it. 24Then they nailed him to the cross. They gambled for his clothes, throwing dice[d] to decide who would get them.25It was nine o'clock in the morning when the crucifixion took place.  26A signboard was fastened to the cross above Jesus' head, announcing the charge against him. It read: "The King of the Jews."  27Two criminals were crucified with him, their crosses on either side of his.[e]  29And the people passing by shouted abuse, shaking their heads in mockery. "Ha! Look at you now!" they yelled at him. "You can destroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days, can you?  30Well then, save yourself and come down from the cross!"31The leading priests and teachers of religious law also mocked Jesus. "He saved others," they scoffed, "but he can't save himself!  32Let this Messiah, this king of Israel, come down from the cross so we can see it and believe him!" Even the two criminals who were being crucified with Jesus ridiculed him.33At noon, darkness fell across the whole land until three o'clock.  34Then, at that time Jesus called out with a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"[f]35Some of the bystanders misunderstood and thought he was calling for the prophet Elijah.  36One of them ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, holding it up to him on a stick so he could drink. "Leave him alone. Let's see whether Elijah will come and take him down!" he said.37Then Jesus uttered another loud cry and breathed his last.  38And the curtain in the Temple was torn in two, from top to bottom.  39When the Roman officer who stood facing him saw how he had died, he exclaimed, "Truly, this was the Son of God!"40Some women were there, watching from a distance, including Mary Magdalene, Mary (the mother of James the younger and of Joseph[g]), and Salome.  41They had been followers of Jesus and had cared for him while he was in Galilee. Then they and many other women had come with him to Jerusalem.42This all happened on Friday, the day of preparation,[h] the day before the Sabbath. As evening approached,  43an honored member of the high council, Joseph from Arimathea (who was waiting for the Kingdom of God to come), gathered his courage and went to Pilate to ask for Jesus' body.  44Pilate couldn't believe that Jesus was already dead, so he called for the Roman military officer in charge and asked him. 45The officer confirmed the fact, and Pilate told Joseph he could have the body.  46Joseph bought a long sheet of linen cloth, and taking Jesus' body down from the cross, he wrapped it in the cloth and laid it in a tomb that had been carved out of the rock. Then he rolled a stone in front of the entrance.  47Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where Jesus' body was laid.
