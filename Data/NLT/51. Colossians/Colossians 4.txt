1 You slave owners must be just and fair to your slaves. Remember that you also have a Master--in heaven.2Devote yourselves to prayer with an alert mind and a thankful heart.  3Don't forget to pray for us, too, that God will give us many opportunities to preach about his secret plan--that Christ is also for you Gentiles. That is why I am here in chains.  4Pray that I will proclaim this message as clearly as I should.5Live wisely among those who are not Christians, and make the most of every opportunity.  6Let your conversation be gracious and effective so that you will have the right answer for everyone.7Tychicus, a much loved brother, will tell you how I am getting along. He is a faithful helper who serves the Lord with me.  8I have sent him on this special trip to let you know how we are doing and to encourage you. 9I am also sending Onesimus, a faithful and much loved brother, one of your own people. He and Tychicus will give you all the latest news.10Aristarchus, who is in prison with me, sends you his greetings, and so does Mark, Barnabas's cousin. And as you were instructed before, make Mark welcome if he comes your way.  11Jesus (the one we call Justus) also sends his greetings. These are the only Jewish Christians among my co-workers; they are working with me here for the Kingdom of God. And what a comfort they have been!12Epaphras, from your city, a servant of Christ Jesus, sends you his greetings. He always prays earnestly for you, asking God to make you strong and perfect, fully confident of the whole will of God.  13I can assure you that he has agonized for you and also for the Christians in Laodicea and Hierapolis.14Dear Doctor Luke sends his greetings, and so does Demas.  15Please give my greetings to our Christian brothers and sisters[a] at Laodicea, and to Nympha and those who meet in her house.16After you have read this letter, pass it on to the church at Laodicea so they can read it, too. And you should read the letter I wrote to them.  17And say to Archippus, "Be sure to carry out the work the Lord gave you."18Here is my greeting in my own handwriting--PAUL. Remember my chains. May the grace of God be with you.
