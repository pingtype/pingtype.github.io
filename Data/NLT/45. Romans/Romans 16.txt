1Our sister Phoebe, a deacon in the church in Cenchrea, will be coming to see you soon.  
2Receive her in the Lord, as one who is worthy of high honor. Help her in every way you can, for she has helped many in their needs, including me.
3Greet Priscilla and Aquila. They have been co-workers in my ministry for Christ Jesus.  
4In fact, they risked their lives for me. I am not the only one who is thankful to them; so are all the Gentile churches.  
5Please give my greetings to the church that meets in their home. Greet my dear friend Epenetus. He was the very first person to become a Christian in the province of Asia. 
6Give my greetings to Mary, who has worked so hard for your benefit.  
7Then there are Andronicus and Junia,[a] my relatives,[b] who were in prison with me. They are respected among the apostles and became Christians before I did. Please give them my greetings.  
8Say hello to Ampliatus, whom I love as one of the Lord's own children,  
9and Urbanus, our co-worker in Christ, and beloved Stachys.
10Give my greetings to Apelles, a good man whom Christ approves. And give my best regards to the members of the household of Aristobulus.  
11Greet Herodion, my relative.[c] Greet the Christians in the household of Narcissus.  
12Say hello to Tryphena and Tryphosa, the Lord's workers, and to dear Persis, who has worked so hard for the Lord.  
13Greet Rufus, whom the Lord picked out to be his very own; and also his dear mother, who has been a mother to me.
14And please give my greetings to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers and sisters[d] who are with them.  
15Give my greetings to Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and to Olympas and all the other believers who are with them.  
16Greet each other in Christian love.[e] All the churches of Christ send you their greetings.
17And now I make one more appeal, my dear brothers and sisters. Watch out for people who cause divisions and upset people's faith by teaching things that are contrary to what you have been taught. Stay away from them.  
18Such people are not serving Christ our Lord; they are serving their own personal interests. By smooth talk and glowing words they deceive innocent people.  
19But everyone knows that you are obedient to the Lord. This makes me very happy. I want you to see clearly what is right and to stay innocent of any wrong.  
20The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
21Timothy, my fellow worker, and Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my relatives, send you their good wishes.
22I, Tertius, the one who is writing this letter for Paul, send my greetings, too, as a Christian brother.
23Gaius says hello to you. I am his guest, and the church meets here in his home. Erastus, the city treasurer, sends you his greetings, and so does Quartus, a Christian brother.[f]
25God is able to make you strong, just as the Good News says. It is the message about Jesus Christ and his plan for you Gentiles, a plan kept secret from the beginning of time.  
26But now as the prophets[g] foretold and as the eternal God has commanded, this message is made known to all Gentiles everywhere, so that they might believe and obey Christ.  
27To God, who alone is wise, be the glory forever through Jesus Christ. Amen.
