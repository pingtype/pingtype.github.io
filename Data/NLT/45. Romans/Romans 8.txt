1So now there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus.  
2For the power[a] of the life-giving Spirit has freed you[b] through Christ Jesus from the power of sin that leads to death.  
3The law of Moses could not save us, because of our sinful nature. But God put into effect a different plan to save us. He sent his own Son in a human body like ours, except that ours are sinful. God destroyed sin's control over us by giving his Son as a sacrifice for our sins.  
4He did this so that the requirement of the law would be fully accomplished for us[c] who no longer follow our sinful nature but instead follow the Spirit.
5Those who are dominated by the sinful nature think about sinful things, but those who are controlled by the Holy Spirit think about things that please the Spirit.  
6If your sinful nature controls your mind, there is death. But if the Holy Spirit controls your mind, there is life and peace.  
7For the sinful nature is always hostile to God. It never did obey God's laws, and it never will.  
8That's why those who are still under the control of their sinful nature can never please God.
9But you are not controlled by your sinful nature. You are controlled by the Spirit if you have the Spirit of God living in you. (And remember that those who do not have the Spirit of Christ living in them are not Christians at all.)  
10Since Christ lives within you, even though your body will die because of sin, your spirit is alive[d] because you have been made right with God.  
11The Spirit of God, who raised Jesus from the dead, lives in you. And just as he raised Christ from the dead, he will give life to your mortal body by this same Spirit living within you.
12So, dear brothers and sisters,[e] you have no obligation whatsoever to do what your sinful nature urges you to do.  
13For if you keep on following it, you will perish. But if through the power of the Holy Spirit you turn from it[f] and its evil deeds, you will live.  
14For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children[g] of God.
15So you should not be like cowering, fearful slaves. You should behave instead like God's very own children, adopted into his family[h]--calling him "Father, dear Father."[i]  
16For his Holy Spirit speaks to us deep in our hearts and tells us that we are God's children.  
17And since we are his children, we will share his treasures--for everything God gives to his Son, Christ, is ours, too. But if we are to share his glory, we must also share his suffering.
18Yet what we suffer now is nothing compared to the glory he will give us later.  
19For all creation is waiting eagerly for that future day when God will reveal who his children really are.  
20Against its will, everything on earth was subjected to God's curse.  
21All creation anticipates the day when it will join God's children in glorious freedom from death and decay.  
22For we know that all creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.  
23And even we Christians, although we have the Holy Spirit within us as a foretaste of future glory, also groan to be released from pain and suffering. We, too, wait anxiously for that day when God will give us our full rights as his children,[j] including the new bodies he has promised us. 
24Now that we are saved, we eagerly look forward to this freedom. For if you already have something, you don't need to hope for it.  
25But if we look forward to something we don't have yet, we must wait patiently and confidently.
26And the Holy Spirit helps us in our distress. For we don't even know what we should pray for, nor how we should pray. But the Holy Spirit prays for us with groanings that cannot be expressed in words.  
27And the Father who knows all hearts knows what the Spirit is saying, for the Spirit pleads for us believers in harmony with God's own will.  
28And we know that God causes everything to work together[k] for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them.  
29For God knew his people in advance, and he chose them to become like his Son, so that his Son would be the firstborn, with many brothers and sisters. 
30And having chosen them, he called them to come to him. And he gave them right standing with himself, and he promised them his glory.
31What can we say about such wonderful things as these? If God is for us, who can ever be against us? 
32Since God did not spare even his own Son but gave him up for us all, won't God, who gave us Christ, also give us everything else?
33Who dares accuse us whom God has chosen for his own? Will God? No! He is the one who has given us right standing with himself.  
34Who then will condemn us? Will Christ Jesus? No, for he is the one who died for us and was raised to life for us and is sitting at the place of highest honor next to God, pleading for us.
35Can anything ever separate us from Christ's love? Does it mean he no longer loves us if we have trouble or calamity, or are persecuted, or are hungry or cold or in danger or threatened with death?  
36(Even the Scriptures say, "For your sake we are killed every day; we are being slaughtered like sheep."[l])  
37No, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us.
38And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from his love. Death can't, and life can't. The angels can't, and the demons can't. Our fears for today, our worries about tomorrow, and even the powers of hell can't keep God's love away.  
39Whether we are high above the sky or in the deepest ocean, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord.
