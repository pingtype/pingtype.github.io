1Therefore, since we have been made right in God's sight by faith, we have peace with God because of what Jesus Christ our Lord has done for us.  
2Because of our faith, Christ has brought us into this place of highest privilege where we now stand, and we confidently and joyfully look forward to sharing God's glory.
3We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they are good for us--they help us learn to endure.  
4And endurance develops strength of character in us, and character strengthens our confident expectation of salvation.  
5And this expectation will not disappoint us. For we know how dearly God loves us, because he has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love.
6When we were utterly helpless, Christ came at just the right time and died for us sinners.  
7Now, no one is likely to die for a good person, though someone might be willing to die for a person who is especially good. 
8But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners.  
9And since we have been made right in God's sight by the blood of Christ, he will certainly save us from God's judgment. 
10For since we were restored to friendship with God by the death of his Son while we were still his enemies, we will certainly be delivered from eternal punishment by his life.  
11So now we can rejoice in our wonderful new relationship with God--all because of what our Lord Jesus Christ has done for us in making us friends of God.
12When Adam sinned, sin entered the entire human race. Adam's sin brought death, so death spread to everyone, for everyone sinned.  
13Yes, people sinned even before the law was given. And though there was no law to break, since it had not yet been given,  
14they all died anyway--even though they did not disobey an explicit commandment of God, as Adam did. What a contrast between Adam and Christ, who was yet to come!  
15And what a difference between our sin and God's generous gift of forgiveness. For this one man, Adam, brought death to many through his sin. But this other man, Jesus Christ, brought forgiveness to many through God's bountiful gift.  
16And the result of God's gracious gift is very different from the result of that one man's sin. For Adam's sin led to condemnation, but we have the free gift of being accepted by God, even though we are guilty of many sins.  
17The sin of this one man, Adam, caused death to rule over us, but all who receive God's wonderful, gracious gift of righteousness will live in triumph over sin and death through this one man, Jesus Christ.
18Yes, Adam's one sin brought condemnation upon everyone, but Christ's one act of righteousness makes all people right in God's sight and gives them life.  
19Because one person disobeyed God, many people became sinners. But because one other person obeyed God, many people will be made right in God's sight.
20God's law was given so that all people could see how sinful they were. But as people sinned more and more, God's wonderful kindness became more abundant.  
21So just as sin ruled over all people and brought them to death, now God's wonderful kindness rules instead, giving us right standing with God and resulting in eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
