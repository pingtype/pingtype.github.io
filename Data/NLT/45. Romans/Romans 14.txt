1Accept Christians who are weak in faith, and don't argue with them about what they think is right or wrong. 
2For instance, one person believes it is all right to eat anything. But another believer who has a sensitive conscience will eat only vegetables.  
3Those who think it is all right to eat anything must not look down on those who won't. And those who won't eat certain foods must not condemn those who do, for God has accepted them.  
4Who are you to condemn God's servants? They are responsible to the Lord, so let him tell them whether they are right or wrong. The Lord's power will help them do as they should.
5In the same way, some think one day is more holy than another day, while others think every day is alike. Each person should have a personal conviction about this matter.  
6Those who have a special day for worshiping the Lord are trying to honor him. Those who eat all kinds of food do so to honor the Lord, since they give thanks to God before eating. And those who won't eat everything also want to please the Lord and give thanks to God.  
7For we are not our own masters when we live or when we die.  
8While we live, we live to please the Lord. And when we die, we go to be with the Lord. So in life and in death, we belong to the Lord. 
9Christ died and rose again for this very purpose, so that he might be Lord of those who are alive and of those who have died.
10So why do you condemn another Christian[a]? Why do you look down on another Christian? Remember, each of us will stand personally before the judgment seat of God.  
11For the Scriptures say, " 'As surely as I live,' says the Lord, `every knee will bow to me and every tongue will confess allegiance to God.' "[b]
12Yes, each of us will have to give a personal account to God.  
13So don't condemn each other anymore. Decide instead to live in such a way that you will not put an obstacle in another Christian's path.
14I know and am perfectly sure on the authority of the Lord Jesus that no food, in and of itself, is wrong to eat. But if someone believes it is wrong, then for that person it is wrong.  
15And if another Christian is distressed by what you eat, you are not acting in love if you eat it. Don't let your eating ruin someone for whom Christ died.  
16Then you will not be condemned for doing something you know is all right.
17For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of what we eat or drink, but of living a life of goodness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.  
18If you serve Christ with this attitude, you will please God. And other people will approve of you, too.  
19So then, let us aim for harmony in the church and try to build each other up.
20Don't tear apart the work of God over what you eat. Remember, there is nothing wrong with these things in themselves. But it is wrong to eat anything if it makes another person stumble.  
21Don't eat meat or drink wine or do anything else if it might cause another Christian to stumble.  
22You may have the faith to believe that there is nothing wrong with what you are doing, but keep it between yourself and God. Blessed are those who do not condemn themselves by doing something they know is all right.  
23But if people have doubts about whether they should eat something, they shouldn't eat it. They would be condemned for not acting in faith before God. If you do anything you believe is not right, you are sinning.
