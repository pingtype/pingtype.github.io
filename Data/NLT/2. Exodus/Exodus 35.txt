1Now Moses called a meeting of all the people and told them, "You must obey these instructions from the LORD.  2Each week, work for six days only. The seventh day is a day of total rest, a holy day that belongs to the LORD. Anyone who works on that day will die.  3Do not even light fires in your homes on that day."4Then Moses said to all the people, "This is what the LORD has commanded.  5Everyone is invited to bring these offerings to the LORD: gold, silver, and bronze;  6blue, purple, and scarlet yarn; fine linen; goat hair for cloth;  7tanned ram skins and fine goatskin leather; acacia wood;  8olive oil for the lamps; spices for the anointing oil and the fragrant incense;  9onyx stones, and other stones to be set in the ephod and the chestpiece.10"Come, all of you who are gifted craftsmen. Construct everything that the LORD has commanded:  11the entire Tabernacle, including the sacred tent and its coverings, the clasps, frames, crossbars, posts, and bases;  12the Ark and its poles; the Ark's cover--the place of atonement; the inner curtain to enclose the Ark in the Most Holy Place;  13the table, its carrying poles, and all of its utensils; the Bread of the Presence;  14the lampstand and its accessories; the lamp cups and the oil for lighting;  15the incense altar and its carrying poles; the anointing oil and fragrant incense; the curtain for the entrance of the Tabernacle;  16the altar of burnt offering; the bronze grating of the altar and its carrying poles and utensils; the large washbasin with its pedestal;  17the curtains for the walls of the courtyard; the posts and their bases; the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard;  18the tent pegs of the Tabernacle and courtyard and their cords;  19the beautifully stitched clothing for the priests to wear while ministering in the Holy Place; the sacred garments for Aaron and his sons to wear while officiating as priests."20So all the people left Moses and went to their tents to prepare their gifts.  21If their hearts were stirred and they desired to do so, they brought to the LORD their offerings of materials for the Tabernacle[a] and its furnishings and for the holy garments.  22Both men and women came, all whose hearts were willing. Some brought to the LORD their offerings of gold--medallions, earrings, rings from their fingers, and necklaces. They presented gold objects of every kind to the LORD.  23Others brought blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, fine linen, or goat hair for cloth. Some gave tanned ram skins or fine goatskin leather.  24Others brought silver and bronze objects as their offering to the LORD. And those who had acacia wood brought it.25All the women who were skilled in sewing and spinning prepared blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine linen cloth, and they brought them in.  26All the women who were willing used their skills to spin and weave the goat hair into cloth.  27The leaders brought onyx stones and the other gemstones to be used for the ephod and the chestpiece.  28They also brought spices and olive oil for the light, the anointing oil, and the fragrant incense.  29So the people of Israel--every man and woman who wanted to help in the work the LORD had given them through Moses--brought their offerings to the LORD.30And Moses told them, "The LORD has chosen Bezalel son of Uri, grandson of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. 31The LORD has filled Bezalel with the Spirit of God, giving him great wisdom, intelligence, and skill in all kinds of crafts.  32He is able to create beautiful objects from gold, silver, and bronze.  33He is skilled in cutting and setting gemstones and in carving wood. In fact, he has every necessary skill.  34And the LORD has given both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach their skills to others.  35The LORD has given them special skills as jewelers, designers, weavers, and embroiderers in blue, purple, and scarlet yarn on fine linen cloth. They excel in all the crafts needed for the work.
