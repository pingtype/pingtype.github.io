1"Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh," the LORD told Moses. "When he feels my powerful hand upon him, he will let the people go. In fact, he will be so anxious to get rid of them that he will force them to leave his land!"2And God continued, "I am the LORD.  3I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty,[a] though I did not reveal my name, the LORD,[b] to them.  4And I entered into a solemn covenant with them. Under its terms, I swore to give them the land of Canaan, where they were living.  5You can be sure that I have heard the groans of the people of Israel, who are now slaves to the Egyptians. I have remembered my covenant with them.6"Therefore, say to the Israelites: `I am the LORD, and I will free you from your slavery in Egypt. I will redeem you with mighty power and great acts of judgment.  7I will make you my own special people, and I will be your God. And you will know that I am the LORD your God who has rescued you from your slavery in Egypt.  8I will bring you into the land I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It will be your very own property. I am the LORD!' "9So Moses told the people what the LORD had said, but they wouldn't listen anymore. They had become too discouraged by the increasing burden of their slavery.10Then the LORD said to Moses,  11"Go back to Pharaoh, and tell him to let the people of Israel leave Egypt."12"But LORD!" Moses objected. "My own people won't listen to me anymore. How can I expect Pharaoh to listen? I'm no orator!"13But the LORD ordered Moses and Aaron to return to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and to demand that he let the people of Israel leave Egypt.14These are the ancestors of clans from some of Israel's tribes: The descendants of Reuben, Israel's oldest son, included Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. Their descendants became the clans of Reuben.15The descendants of Simeon included Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar, and Shaul (whose mother was a Canaanite). Their descendants became the clans of Simeon.16These are the descendants of Levi, listed according to their family groups. In the first generation were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. (Levi, their father, lived to be 137 years old.)17 The descendants of Gershon included Libni and Shimei, each of whom is the ancestor of a clan.18 The descendants of Kohath included Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. (Kohath lived to be 133 years old.)19 The descendants of Merari included Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of the Levites, listed according to their genealogies.20Amram married his father's sister Jochebed, and she bore him Aaron and Moses. (Amram lived to be 137 years old.)21The descendants of Izhar included Korah, Nepheg, and Zicri.22The descendants of Uzziel included Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.23Aaron married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.24The descendants of Korah included Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph.

These are the ancestors of the Levite clans, listed according to their family groups.26The Aaron and Moses named in this list are the same Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, "Lead all the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt, division by division."  27They are the ones who went to Pharaoh to ask permission to lead the people from the land of Egypt.28At that time, the LORD had said to them,  29"I am the LORD! Give Pharaoh the message I have given you."  30This is the same Moses who had argued with the LORD, saying, "I can't do it! I'm no orator. Why should Pharaoh listen to me?"
