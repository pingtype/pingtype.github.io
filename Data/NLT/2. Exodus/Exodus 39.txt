1For the priests, the craftsmen made beautiful garments of blue, purple, and scarlet cloth--clothing to be worn while ministering in the Holy Place. This same cloth was used for Aaron's sacred garments, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.2The ephod was made from fine linen cloth and embroidered with gold thread and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn.  3A skilled craftsman made gold thread by beating gold into thin sheets and cutting it into fine strips. He then embroidered it into the linen with the blue, purple, and scarlet yarn.4They made two shoulder-pieces for the ephod, which were attached to its corners so it could be tied down.  5They also made an elaborate woven sash of the same materials: fine linen cloth; blue, purple, and scarlet yarn; and gold thread, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.  6The two onyx stones, attached to the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, were set in gold filigree. The stones were engraved with the names of the tribes of Israel, just as initials are engraved on a seal.  7These stones served as reminders to the LORD concerning the people of Israel. All this was done just as the LORD had commanded Moses.8The chestpiece was made in the same style as the ephod, crafted from fine linen cloth and embroidered with gold thread and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn.  9It was doubled over to form a pouch, nine inches[a] square.  10Four rows of gemstones[b] were set across it. In the first row were a red carnelian, a chrysolite, and an emerald.  11In the second row were a turquoise, a sapphire, and a white moonstone.  12In the third row were a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst.  13In the fourth row were a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. Each of these gemstones was set in gold.  14The stones were engraved like a seal, each with the name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel.15To attach the chestpiece to the ephod, they made braided cords of pure gold.  16They also made two gold rings and attached them to the top corners of the chestpiece.  17The two gold cords were put through the gold rings on the chestpiece,  18and the ends of the cords were tied to the gold settings on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod.  19Two more gold rings were attached to the lower inside corners of the chestpiece next to the ephod.  20Then two gold rings were attached to the ephod near the sash.  21Blue cords were used to attach the bottom rings of the chestpiece to the rings on the ephod. In this way, the chestpiece was held securely to the ephod above the beautiful sash. All this was done just as the LORD had commanded Moses.22The robe of the ephod was woven entirely of blue yarn,  23with an opening for Aaron's head in the middle of it. The edge of this opening was reinforced with a woven collar,[c] so it would not tear.  24Pomegranates were attached to the bottom edge of the robe. These were finely crafted of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn.  25Bells of pure gold were placed between the pomegranates along the hem of the robe,  26with bells and pomegranates alternating all around the hem. This robe was to be worn when Aaron ministered to the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.27Tunics were then made for Aaron and his sons from fine linen cloth.  28The turban, the headdresses, and the underclothes were all made of this fine linen.  29The sashes were made of fine linen cloth and embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.  30Finally, they made the sacred medallion of pure gold to be worn on the front of the turban. Using the techniques of an engraver, they inscribed it with these words: SET APART AS HOLY TO THE LORD.  31This medallion was tied to the turban with a blue cord, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.32And so at last the Tabernacle[d] was finished. The Israelites had done everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses.  33And they brought the entire Tabernacle to Moses: the sacred tent with all its furnishings, the clasps, frames, crossbars, posts, and bases;  34the layers of tanned ram skins and fine goatskin leather; the inner curtain that enclosed the Most Holy Place;  35the Ark of the Covenant[e] and its carrying poles; the Ark's cover--the place of atonement;  36the table and all its utensils; the Bread of the Presence;  37the gold lampstand and its accessories; the lamp cups and the oil for lighting;  38the gold altar; the anointing oil; the fragrant incense; the curtain for the entrance of the sacred tent;  39the bronze altar; the bronze grating; its poles and utensils; the large washbasin and its pedestal;  40the curtains for the walls of the courtyard and the posts and bases holding them up; the curtain at the courtyard entrance; the cords and tent pegs; all the articles used in the operation of the Tabernacle;  41the beautifully crafted garments to be worn while ministering in the Holy Place--the holy garments for Aaron the priest and for his sons to wear while on duty.42So the people of Israel followed all of the LORD's instructions to Moses.  43Moses inspected all their work and blessed them because it had been done as the LORD had commanded him.
