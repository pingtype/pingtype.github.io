1 "Bezalel, Oholiab, and the other craftsmen whom the LORD has gifted with wisdom, skill, and intelligence will construct and furnish the Tabernacle, just as the LORD has commanded."2So Moses told Bezalel and Oholiab to begin the work, along with all those who were specially gifted by the LORD.  3Moses gave them the materials donated by the people for the completion of the sanctuary. Additional gifts were brought each morning.  4But finally the craftsmen left their work to meet with Moses.  5"We have more than enough materials on hand now to complete the job the LORD has given us to do!" they exclaimed.6So Moses gave the command, and this message was sent throughout the camp: "Bring no more materials! You have already given more than enough." So the people stopped bringing their offerings.  7Their contributions were more than enough to complete the whole project.8The skilled weavers first made ten sheets from fine linen. One of the craftsmen then embroidered blue, purple, and scarlet cherubim into them.  9Each sheet was exactly the same size--forty-two feet long and six feet wide.[a]  10Five of these sheets were joined together to make one set, and a second set was made of the other five.  11Fifty blue loops were placed along the edge of the last sheet in each set.  12The fifty loops along the edge of the first set of sheets matched the loops along the edge of the second set.  13Then fifty gold clasps were made to connect the loops on the edge of each set. Thus the Tabernacle was joined together in one piece.14Above the Tabernacle, a roof covering was made from eleven sheets of cloth made from goat hair. 15Each sheet was exactly the same size--forty-five feet long and six feet wide.  16The craftsmen joined five of these sheets together to make one set, and the six remaining sheets were joined to make a second set. 17Then they made fifty loops along the edge of the last sheet in each set.  18They also made fifty small bronze clasps to couple the loops, so the two sets of sheets were firmly attached to each other. In this way, the roof covering was joined together in one piece.  19Then they made two more layers for the roof covering. The first was made of tanned ram skins, and the second was made of fine goatskin leather.20For the framework of the Tabernacle, they made frames of acacia wood standing on end.  21Each frame was 15 feet high and 2 1/4 feet wide.  22There were two pegs on each frame so they could be joined to the next frame. All the frames were made this way.  23They made twenty frames to support the south side, 24along with forty silver bases, two for each frame.  25They also made twenty frames for the north side of the Tabernacle,  26along with forty silver bases, two for each frame.  27The west side of the Tabernacle, which was its rear, was made from six frames,  28plus an extra frame at each corner.  29These corner frames were connected at the bottom and firmly attached at the top with a single ring, forming a single unit from top to bottom. They made two of these, one for each rear corner.  30So for the west side they made a total of eight frames, along with sixteen silver bases, two for each frame.31Then they made five crossbars from acacia wood to tie the frames on the south side together.  32They made another five for the north side and five for the west side.  33The middle crossbar of the five was halfway up the frames, along each side, running from one end to the other.  34The frames and crossbars were all overlaid with gold. The rings used to hold the crossbars were made of pure gold.35The inner curtain was made of fine linen cloth, and cherubim were skillfully embroidered into it with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn.  36This curtain was then attached to four gold hooks set into four posts of acacia wood. The posts were overlaid with gold and set into four silver bases.37Then they made another curtain for the entrance to the sacred tent. It was made of fine linen cloth and embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn.  38This curtain was connected by five hooks to five posts. The posts with their decorated tops and bands were overlaid with gold. The five bases were molded from bronze.
