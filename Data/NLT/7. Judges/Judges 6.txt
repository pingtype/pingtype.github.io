1Again the Israelites did what was evil in the LORD's sight. So the LORD handed them over to the Midianites for seven years.  2The Midianites were so cruel that the Israelites fled to the mountains, where they made hiding places for themselves in caves and dens.  3Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, marauders from Midian, Amalek, and the people of the east would attack Israel,  4camping in the land and destroying crops as far away as Gaza. They left the Israelites with nothing to eat, taking all the sheep, oxen, and donkeys.  5These enemy hordes, coming with their cattle and tents as thick as locusts, arrived on droves of camels too numerous to count. And they stayed until the land was stripped bare.  6So Israel was reduced to starvation by the Midianites. Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD for help.7When they cried out to the LORD because of Midian,  8the LORD sent a prophet to the Israelites. He said, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I brought you up out of slavery in Egypt  9and rescued you from the Egyptians and from all who oppressed you. I drove out your enemies and gave you their land.  10I told you, `I am the LORD your God. You must not worship the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you now live.' But you have not listened to me."11Then the angel of the LORD came and sat beneath the oak tree at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash of the clan of Abiezer. Gideon son of Joash had been threshing wheat at the bottom of a winepress to hide the grain from the Midianites.  12The angel of the LORD appeared to him and said, "Mighty hero, the LORD is with you!"13"Sir," Gideon replied, "if the LORD is with us, why has all this happened to us? And where are all the miracles our ancestors told us about? Didn't they say, `The LORD brought us up out of Egypt'? But now the LORD has abandoned us and handed us over to the Midianites."14Then the LORD turned to him and said, "Go with the strength you have and rescue Israel from the Midianites. I am sending you!"15"But Lord," Gideon replied, "how can I rescue Israel? My clan is the weakest in the whole tribe of Manasseh, and I am the least in my entire family!"16The LORD said to him, "I will be with you. And you will destroy the Midianites as if you were fighting against one man."17Gideon replied, "If you are truly going to help me, show me a sign to prove that it is really the LORD speaking to me.  18Don't go away until I come back and bring my offering to you." The LORD answered, "I will stay here until you return."19Gideon hurried home. He cooked a young goat, and with half a bushel[a] of flour he baked some bread without yeast. Then, carrying the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, he brought them out and presented them to the angel, who was under the oak tree.20The angel of God said to him, "Place the meat and the unleavened bread on this rock, and pour the broth over it." And Gideon did as he was told.  21Then the angel of the LORD touched the meat and bread with the staff in his hand, and fire flamed up from the rock and consumed all he had brought. And the angel of the LORD disappeared.22When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the LORD, he cried out, "Sovereign LORD, I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face!"23"It is all right," the LORD replied. "Do not be afraid. You will not die."  24And Gideon built an altar to the LORD there and named it "The LORD Is Peace."[b] The altar remains in Ophrah in the land of the clan of Abiezer to this day.25That night the LORD said to Gideon, "Take the second best bull from your father's herd, the one that is seven years old. Pull down your father's altar to Baal, and cut down the Asherah pole standing beside it. 26Then build an altar to the LORD your God here on this hill, laying the stones carefully. Sacrifice the bull as a burnt offering on the altar, using as fuel the wood of the Asherah pole you cut down."  27So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the LORD had commanded. But he did it at night because he was afraid of the other members of his father's household and the people of the town. He knew what would happen if they found out who had done it.28Early the next morning, as the people of the town began to stir, someone discovered that the altar of Baal had been knocked down and that the Asherah pole beside it was gone. In their place a new altar had been built, and it had the remains of a sacrifice on it.  29The people said to each other, "Who did this?" And after asking around and making a careful search, they learned that it was Gideon, the son of Joash.30"Bring out your son," they shouted to Joash. "He must die for destroying the altar of Baal and for cutting down the Asherah pole."31But Joash shouted to the mob, "Why are you defending Baal? Will you argue his case? Whoever pleads his case will be put to death by morning! If Baal truly is a god, let him defend himself and destroy the one who knocked down his altar!"  32From then on Gideon was called Jerubbaal, which means "Let Baal defend himself," because he knocked down Baal's altar.33Soon afterward the armies of Midian, Amalek, and the people of the east formed an alliance against Israel and crossed the Jordan, camping in the valley of Jezreel.  34Then the Spirit of the LORD took possession of Gideon. He blew a ram's horn as a call to arms, and the men of the clan of Abiezer came to him.  35He also sent messengers throughout Manasseh, Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, summoning their warriors, and all of them responded.36Then Gideon said to God, "If you are truly going to use me to rescue Israel as you promised,  37prove it to me in this way. I will put some wool on the threshing floor tonight. If the fleece is wet with dew in the morning but the ground is dry, then I will know that you are going to help me rescue Israel as you promised."  38And it happened just that way. When Gideon got up the next morning, he squeezed the fleece and wrung out a whole bowlful of water.39Then Gideon said to God, "Please don't be angry with me, but let me make one more request. This time let the fleece remain dry while the ground around it is wet with dew."  40So that night God did as Gideon asked. The fleece was dry in the morning, but the ground was covered with dew.
