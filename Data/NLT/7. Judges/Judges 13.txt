1Again the Israelites did what was evil in the LORD's sight, so the LORD handed them over to the Philistines, who kept them in subjection for forty years.2In those days, a man named Manoah from the tribe of Dan lived in the town of Zorah. His wife was unable to become pregnant, and they had no children.  3The angel of the LORD appeared to Manoah's wife and said, "Even though you have been unable to have children, you will soon become pregnant and give birth to a son.  4You must not drink wine or any other alcoholic drink or eat any forbidden food.  5You will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and his hair must never be cut. For he will be dedicated to God as a Nazirite from birth. He will rescue Israel from the Philistines."6The woman ran and told her husband, "A man of God appeared to me! He was like one of God's angels, terrifying to look at. I didn't ask where he was from, and he didn't tell me his name.  7But he told me, `You will become pregnant and give birth to a son. You must not drink wine or any other alcoholic drink or eat any forbidden food. For your son will be dedicated to God as a Nazirite from the moment of his birth until the day of his death.' "8Then Manoah prayed to the LORD. He said, "Lord, please let the man of God come back to us again and give us more instructions about this son who is to be born."9God answered his prayer, and the angel of God appeared once again to his wife as she was sitting in the field. But her husband, Manoah, was not with her.  10So she quickly ran and told her husband, "The man who appeared to me the other day is here again!"11Manoah ran back with his wife and asked, "Are you the man who talked to my wife the other day?" "Yes," he replied, "I am."12So Manoah asked him, "When your words come true, what kind of rules should govern the boy's life and work?"13The angel of the LORD replied, "Be sure your wife follows the instructions I gave her.  14She must not eat grapes or raisins, drink wine or any other alcoholic drink, or eat any forbidden food."15Then Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, "Please stay here until we can prepare a young goat for you to eat."16"I will stay," the angel of the LORD replied, "but I will not eat anything. However, you may prepare a burnt offering as a sacrifice to the LORD." (Manoah didn't realize it was the angel of the LORD.)17Then Manoah asked the angel of the LORD, "What is your name? For when all this comes true, we want to honor you."18"Why do you ask my name?" the angel of the LORD replied. "You wouldn't understand if I told you."19Then Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering and offered it on a rock as a sacrifice to the LORD. And as Manoah and his wife watched, the LORD did an amazing thing.  20As the flames from the altar shot up toward the sky, the angel of the LORD ascended in the fire. When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell with their faces to the ground.21The angel did not appear again to Manoah and his wife. Manoah finally realized it was the angel of the LORD,  22and he said to his wife, "We will die, for we have seen God!"23But his wife said, "If the LORD were going to kill us, he wouldn't have accepted our burnt offering and grain offering. He wouldn't have appeared to us and told us this wonderful thing and done these miracles."24When her son was born, they named him Samson. And the LORD blessed him as he grew up.  25And in Mahaneh-dan, which is located between the towns of Zorah and Eshtaol, the Spirit of the LORD began to take hold of him.
