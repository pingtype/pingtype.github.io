1After Abimelech's death, Tola, the son of Puah and descendant of Dodo, came to rescue Israel. He was from the tribe of Issachar but lived in the town of Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim.  2He was Israel's judge for twenty-three years. When he died, he was buried in Shamir.3After Tola died, a man from Gilead named Jair judged Israel for twenty-two years.  4His thirty sons rode around on thirty donkeys, and they owned thirty towns in the land of Gilead, which are still called the Towns of Jair.[a]  5When Jair died, he was buried in Kamon.6Again the Israelites did evil in the LORD's sight. They worshiped images of Baal and Ashtoreth, and the gods of Aram, Sidon, Moab, Ammon, and Philistia. Not only this, but they abandoned the LORD and no longer served him at all.  7So the LORD burned with anger against Israel, and he handed them over to the Philistines and the Ammonites,  8who began to oppress them that year. For eighteen years they oppressed all the Israelites east of the Jordan River in the land of the Amorites (that is, in Gilead).  9The Ammonites also crossed to the west side of the Jordan and attacked Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim. The Israelites were in great distress.  10Finally, they cried out to the LORD, saying, "We have sinned against you because we have abandoned you as our God and have served the images of Baal."11The LORD replied, "Did I not rescue you from the Egyptians, the Amorites, the Ammonites, the Philistines,  12the Sidonians, the Amalekites, and the Maonites? When they oppressed you, you cried out to me, and I rescued you.  13Yet you have abandoned me and served other gods. So I will not rescue you anymore.  14Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen! Let them rescue you in your hour of distress!"15But the Israelites pleaded with the LORD and said, "We have sinned. Punish us as you see fit, only rescue us today from our enemies."  16Then the Israelites put aside their foreign gods and served the LORD. And he was grieved by their misery.17At that time the armies of Ammon had gathered for war and were camped in Gilead, preparing to attack Israel's army at Mizpah.  18The leaders of Gilead said to each other, "Whoever attacks the Ammonites first will become ruler over all the people of Gilead."
