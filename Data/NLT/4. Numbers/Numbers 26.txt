1After the plague had ended, the LORD said to Moses and to Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest,  2"Take a census of all the men of Israel who are twenty years old or older, to find out how many of each family are of military age."  3At that time the entire nation of Israel was camped on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River, across from Jericho. So Moses and Eleazar the priest issued these census instructions to the leaders of Israel:  4"Count all the men of Israel twenty years old and older, just as the LORD commanded Moses." This is the census record of all the descendants of Israel who came out of Egypt.5These were the clans descended from Reuben, Jacob's[a] oldest son: The Hanochite clan, named after its ancestor Hanoch.

This Dathan and Abiram are the same community leaders who conspired with Korah against Moses and Aaron, defying the LORD.  10But the earth opened up and swallowed them with Korah, and 250 of their followers were destroyed that day by fire from the LORD. This served as a warning to the entire nation of Israel.  11However, the sons of Korah did not die that day.12These were the clans descended from the sons of Simeon: The Nemuelite clan, named after its ancestor Nemuel.

The Tahanite clan, named after its ancestor Tahan.36This was the subclan descended from the Shuthelahites: The Eranites, named after their ancestor Eran.37The men from all the clans of Ephraim numbered 32,500. These clans of Manasseh and Ephraim were all descendants of Joseph.38These were the clans descended from the sons of Benjamin: The Belaite clan, named after its ancestor Bela.

The Gunite clan, named after its ancestor Guni.49 The Jezerite clan, named after its ancestor Jezer. The Shillemite clan, named after its ancestor Shillem.50The men from all the clans of Naphtali numbered 45,400.51So the total number of Israelite men counted in the census numbered 601,730.52Then the LORD said to Moses,  53"Divide the land among the tribes in proportion to their populations, as indicated by the census.  54Give the larger tribes more land and the smaller tribes less land, each group's inheritance reflecting the size of its population.  55Make sure you assign the land by lot, and define the inheritance of each ancestral tribe by means of the census listings.  56Each inheritance must be assigned by lot among the larger and smaller tribal groups."57This is the census record for the Levites who were counted according to their clans: The Gershonite clan, named after its ancestor Gershon. The Kohathite clan, named after its ancestor Kohath. The Merarite clan, named after its ancestor Merari.58The Libnites, the Hebronites, the Mahlites, the Mushites, and the Korahites were all subclans of the Levites. Now Kohath was the ancestor of Amram,  59and Amram's wife was named Jochebed. She also was a descendant of Levi, born among the Levites in the land of Egypt. Amram and Jochebed became the parents of Aaron, Moses, and their sister, Miriam.  60To Aaron were born Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.  61But Nadab and Abihu died when they burned before the LORD a different kind of fire than he had commanded.62The men from the Levite clans who were one month old or older numbered 23,000. But the Levites were not included in the total census figure of the people of Israel because they were not given an inheritance of land when it was divided among the Israelites.63So these are the census figures of the people of Israel as prepared by Moses and Eleazar the priest on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River, across from Jericho.  64Not one person that was counted in this census had been among those counted in the previous census taken by Moses and Aaron in the wilderness of Sinai.  65For the LORD had said of them, "They will all die in the wilderness." The only exceptions were Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
