1On the day Moses set up the Tabernacle, he anointed it and set it apart as holy, along with all its furnishings and the altar with its utensils.  2Then the leaders of Israel--the tribal leaders who had organized the census--came and brought their offerings.  3Together they brought six carts and twelve oxen. There was a cart for every two leaders and an ox for each leader. They presented these to the LORD in front of the Tabernacle.4Then the LORD said to Moses,  5"Receive their gifts and use these oxen and carts for the work of the Tabernacle.[a] Distribute them among the Levites according to the work they have to do."  6So Moses presented the carts and oxen to the Levites.  7He gave two carts and four oxen to the Gershonite division for their work,  8and four carts and eight oxen to the Merarite division for their work. All their work was done under the leadership of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.  9But he gave none of the carts or oxen to the Kohathite division, since they were required to carry the sacred objects of the Tabernacle on their shoulders.10The leaders also presented dedication gifts for the altar at the time it was anointed. They each placed their gifts before the altar.  11The LORD said to Moses, "Let each leader bring his gift on a different day for the dedication of the altar."12On the first day Nahshon son of Amminadab, leader of the tribe of Judah, presented his offering.13The offering consisted of a silver platter weighing about 3 1/4 pounds and a silver basin of about 1 3/4 pounds.[b] These were both filled with grain offerings of choice flour mixed with olive oil.  14He also brought a gold container weighing about four ounces,[c] which was filled with incense.  15He brought a young bull, a ram, and a one-year-old male lamb as a burnt offering;  16a male goat for a sin offering;  17and two oxen, five rams, five male goats, and five one-year-old male lambs for a peace offering.
