[Registration of Israel's Troops] 1 A year after Israel's departure from Egypt, the Lord  spoke to Moses in the Tabernacle* in the wilderness of Sinai. On the first day of the second month* of that year he said, 2 "From the whole community of Israel, record the names of all the warriors by their clans and families. List all the men 3 twenty years old or older who are able to go to war. You and Aaron must register the troops, 4 and you will be assisted by one family leader from each tribe.5 "These are the tribes and the names of the leaders who will assist you:               [Tribe]         [Leader]               Reuben         Elizur son of Shedeur               6 Simeon         Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai               7 Judah         Nahshon son of Amminadab               8 Issachar         Nethanel son of Zuar               9 Zebulun         Eliab son of Helon               10 Ephraim son of Joseph         Elishama son of Ammihud               Manasseh son of Joseph         Gamaliel son of Pedahzur               11 Benjamin         Abidan son of Gideoni               12 Dan         Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai               13 Asher         Pagiel son of Ocran               14 Gad         Eliasaph son of Deuel               15 Naphtali         Ahira son of Enan16 These are the chosen leaders of the community, the leaders of their ancestral tribes, the heads of the clans of Israel."17 So Moses and Aaron called together these chosen leaders, 18 and they assembled the whole community of Israel on that very day.* All the people were registered according to their ancestry by their clans and families. The men of Israel who were twenty years old or older were listed one by one, 19 just as the Lord  had commanded Moses. So Moses recorded their names in the wilderness of Sinai.20-21 This is the number of men twenty years old or older who were able to go to war, as their names were listed in the records of their clans and families*:               [Tribe]         [Number]               Reuben (Jacob's*oldest son)         46,500               22-23 Simeon         59,300               24-25 Gad         45,650               26-27 Judah         74,600               28-29 Issachar         54,400               30-31 Zebulun         57,400               32-33 Ephraim son of Joseph         40,500               34-35 Manasseh son of Joseph         32,200               36-37 Benjamin         35,400               38-39 Dan         62,700               40-41 Asher         41,500               42-43 Naphtali         53,40044 These were the men registered by Moses and Aaron and the twelve leaders of Israel, all listed according to their ancestral descent. 45 They were registered by families-all the men of Israel who were twenty years old or older and able to go to war. 46 The total number was 603,550.47 But this total did not include the Levites. 48 For the Lord  had said to Moses, 49 "Do not include the tribe of Levi in the registration; do not count them with the rest of the Israelites. 50 Put the Levites in charge of the Tabernacle of the Covenant,* along with all its furnishings and equipment. They must carry the Tabernacle and all its furnishings as you travel, and they must take care of it and camp around it. 51 Whenever it is time for the Tabernacle to move, the Levites will take it down. And when it is time to stop, they will set it up again. But any unauthorized person who goes too near the Tabernacle must be put to death. 52 Each tribe of Israel will camp in a designated area with its own family banner. 53 But the Levites will camp around the Tabernacle of the Covenant to protect the community of Israel from the Lord 's anger. The Levites are responsible to stand guard around the Tabernacle."54 So the Israelites did everything just as the Lord  had commanded Moses.       Footnotes: 1:1a Hebrew the Tent of Meeting.   1:1b This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in April or May.   1:18 Hebrew on the first day of the second month; see 1:1.   1:20-21a In the Hebrew text, this sentence ( This is the number of men twenty years old or older who were able to go to war, as their names were listed in the records of their clans and families ) is repeated in 1:22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42.   1:20-21b Hebrew Israel's.
