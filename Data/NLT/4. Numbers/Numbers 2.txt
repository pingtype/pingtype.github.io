[Organization for Israel's Camp] 1 Then the Lord  gave these instructions to Moses and Aaron: 2 "When the Israelites set up camp, each tribe will be assigned its own area. The tribal divisions will camp beneath their family banners on all four sides of the Tabernacle,[a] but at some distance from it.3-4 "The divisions of Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun are to camp toward the sunrise on the east side of the Tabernacle, beneath their family banners. These are the names of the tribes, their leaders, and the numbers of their registered troops: [Tribe]         [Leader]         [Number]               Judah         Nahshon son of Amminadab         74,600               5-6 Issachar         Nethanel son of Zuar         54,400               7-8 Zebulun         Eliab son of Helon         57,4009 So the total of all the troops on Judah's side of the camp is 186,400. These three tribes are to lead the way whenever the Israelites travel to a new campsite.10-11 "The divisions of Reuben, Simeon, and Gad are to camp on the south side of the Tabernacle, beneath their family banners. These are the names of the tribes, their leaders, and the numbers of their registered troops: [Tribe]         [Leader]         [Number]               Reuben         Elizur son of Shedeur         46,500               12-13 Simeon         Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai         59,300               14-15 Gad         Eliasaph son of Deuel[b]45,65016 So the total of all the troops on Reuben's side of the camp is 151,450. These three tribes will be second in line whenever the Israelites travel.17 "Then the Tabernacle, carried by the Levites, will set out from the middle of the camp. All the tribes are to travel in the same order that they camp, each in position under the appropriate family banner.18-19 "The divisions of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin are to camp on the west side of the Tabernacle, beneath their family banners. These are the names of the tribes, their leaders, and the numbers of their registered troops: [Tribe]         [Leader]         [Number]               Ephraim         Elishama son of Ammihud         40,500               20-21 Manasseh         Gamaliel son of Pedahzur         32,200               22-23 Benjamin         Abidan son of Gideoni         35,40024 So the total of all the troops on Ephraim's side of the camp is 108,100. These three tribes will be third in line whenever the Israelites travel.25-26 "The divisions of Dan, Asher, and Naphtali are to camp on the north side of the Tabernacle, beneath their family banners. These are the names of the tribes, their leaders, and the numbers of their registered troops: [Tribe]         [Leader]         [Number]               Dan         Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai         62,700               27-28 Asher         Pagiel son of Ocran         41,500               29-30 Naphtali         Ahira son of Enan         53,40031 So the total of all the troops on Dan's side of the camp is 157,600. These three tribes will be last, marching under their banners whenever the Israelites travel."32 In summary, the troops of Israel listed by their families totaled 603,550. 33 But as the Lord  had commanded, the Levites were not included in this registration. 34 So the people of Israel did everything as the Lord  had commanded Moses. Each clan and family set up camp and marched under their banners exactly as the Lord  had instructed them.       Footnotes:a.   2:2 Hebrew the Tent of Meeting; also in 2:17.  b.   2:14-15 As in many Hebrew manuscripts, Samaritan Pentateuch, and Latin Vulgate (see also 1:14); most Hebrew manuscripts read son of Reuel.
