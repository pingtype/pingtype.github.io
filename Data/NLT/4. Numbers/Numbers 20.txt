1In early spring[a] the people of Israel arrived in the wilderness of Zin and camped at Kadesh. While they were there, Miriam died and was buried.2There was no water for the people to drink at that place, so they rebelled against Moses and Aaron.  3The people blamed Moses and said, "We wish we had died in the LORD's presence with our brothers!  4Did you bring the LORD's people into this wilderness to die, along with all our livestock?  5Why did you make us leave Egypt and bring us here to this terrible place? This land has no grain, figs, grapes, or pomegranates. And there is no water to drink!"6Moses and Aaron turned away from the people and went to the entrance of the Tabernacle,[b] where they fell face down on the ground. Then the glorious presence of the LORD appeared to them,  7and the LORD said to Moses,  8"You and Aaron must take the staff and assemble the entire community. As the people watch, command the rock over there to pour out its water. You will get enough water from the rock to satisfy all the people and their livestock."9So Moses did as he was told. He took the staff from the place where it was kept before the LORD.  10Then he and Aaron summoned the people to come and gather at the rock. "Listen, you rebels!" he shouted. "Must we bring you water from this rock?"  11Then Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice with the staff, and water gushed out. So all the people and their livestock drank their fill.12But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you did not trust me enough to demonstrate my holiness to the people of Israel, you will not lead them into the land I am giving them!"  13This place was known as the waters of Meribah,[c] because it was where the people of Israel argued with the LORD, and where he demonstrated his holiness among them.14While Moses was at Kadesh, he sent ambassadors to the king of Edom with this message: "This message is from your relatives, the people of Israel: You know all the hardships we have been through,  15and that our ancestors went down to Egypt. We lived there a long time and suffered as slaves to the Egyptians.  16But when we cried out to the LORD, he heard us and sent an angel who brought us out of Egypt. Now we are camped at Kadesh, a town on the border of your land.  17Please let us pass through your country. We will be careful not to go through your fields and vineyards. We won't even drink water from your wells. We will stay on the king's road and never leave it until we have crossed the opposite border."18But the king of Edom said, "Stay out of my land or I will meet you with an army!"19The Israelites answered, "We will stay on the main road. If any of our livestock drinks your water, we will pay for it. We only want to pass through your country and nothing else."20But the king of Edom replied, "Stay out! You may not pass through our land." With that he mobilized his army and marched out to meet them with an imposing force.  21Because Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through their country, Israel was forced to turn around.22The whole community of Israel left Kadesh as a group and arrived at Mount Hor.  23Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor on the border of the land of Edom,  24"The time has come for Aaron to join his ancestors in death. He will not enter the land I am giving the people of Israel, because the two of you rebelled against my instructions concerning the waters of Meribah.  25Now take Aaron and his son Eleazar up Mount Hor.  26There you will remove Aaron's priestly garments and put them on Eleazar, his son. Aaron will die there and join his ancestors."27So Moses did as the LORD commanded. The three of them went up Mount Hor together as the whole community watched.  28At the summit, Moses removed the priestly garments from Aaron and put them on Eleazar, Aaron's son. Then Aaron died there on top of the mountain, and Moses and Eleazar went back down. 29When the people realized that Aaron had died, all Israel mourned for him thirty days.
