1Most honorable Theophilus:ÊMany people have written accounts about the events that took place[a] among us.  2They used as their source material the reports circulating among us from the early disciples and other eyewitnesses of what God has done in fulfillment of his promises.  3Having carefully investigated all of these accounts from the beginning, I have decided to write a careful summary for you,  4to reassure you of the truth of all you were taught.5It all begins with a Jewish priest, Zechariah, who lived when Herod was king of Judea. Zechariah was a member of the priestly order of Abijah. His wife, Elizabeth, was also from the priestly line of Aaron. 6Zechariah and Elizabeth were righteous in God's eyes, careful to obey all of the Lord's commandments and regulations.  7They had no children because Elizabeth was barren, and now they were both very old.8One day Zechariah was serving God in the Temple, for his order was on duty that week.  9As was the custom of the priests, he was chosen by lot to enter the sanctuary and burn incense in the Lord's presence. 10While the incense was being burned, a great crowd stood outside, praying.11Zechariah was in the sanctuary when an angel of the Lord appeared, standing to the right of the incense altar.  12Zechariah was overwhelmed with fear.  13But the angel said, "Don't be afraid, Zechariah! For God has heard your prayer, and your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son! And you are to name him John.  14You will have great joy and gladness, and many will rejoice with you at his birth,  15for he will be great in the eyes of the Lord. He must never touch wine or hard liquor, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even before his birth.[b]  16And he will persuade many Israelites to turn to the Lord their God.  17He will be a man with the spirit and power of Elijah, the prophet of old. He will precede the coming of the Lord, preparing the people for his arrival. He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and he will change disobedient minds to accept godly wisdom."[c]18Zechariah said to the angel, "How can I know this will happen? I'm an old man now, and my wife is also well along in years."19Then the angel said, "I am Gabriel! I stand in the very presence of God. It was he who sent me to bring you this good news!  20And now, since you didn't believe what I said, you won't be able to speak until the child is born. For my words will certainly come true at the proper time."21Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah to come out, wondering why he was taking so long. 22When he finally did come out, he couldn't speak to them. Then they realized from his gestures that he must have seen a vision in the Temple sanctuary.23He stayed at the Temple until his term of service was over, and then he returned home.  24Soon afterward his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and went into seclusion for five months.  25"How kind the Lord is!" she exclaimed. "He has taken away my disgrace of having no children!"26In the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a village in Galilee, 27to a virgin named Mary. She was engaged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of King David.  28Gabriel appeared to her and said, "Greetings, favored woman! The Lord is with you![d]"29Confused and disturbed, Mary tried to think what the angel could mean.  30"Don't be frightened, Mary," the angel told her, "for God has decided to bless you!  31You will become pregnant and have a son, and you are to name him Jesus.  32He will be very great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David.  33And he will reign over Israel[e] forever; his Kingdom will never end!"34Mary asked the angel, "But how can I have a baby? I am a virgin."35The angel replied, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the baby born to you will be holy, and he will be called the Son of God.  36What's more, your relative Elizabeth has become pregnant in her old age! People used to say she was barren, but she's already in her sixth month.  37For nothing is impossible with God."38Mary responded, "I am the Lord's servant, and I am willing to accept whatever he wants. May everything you have said come true." And then the angel left.39A few days later Mary hurried to the hill country of Judea, to the town  40where Zechariah lived. She entered the house and greeted Elizabeth.  41At the sound of Mary's greeting, Elizabeth's child leaped within her, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.42Elizabeth gave a glad cry and exclaimed to Mary, "You are blessed by God above all other women, and your child is blessed.  43What an honor this is, that the mother of my Lord should visit me!  44When you came in and greeted me, my baby jumped for joy the instant I heard your voice!  45You are blessed, because you believed that the Lord would do what he said."46Mary responded, "Oh, how I praise the Lord.47 How I rejoice in God my Savior!48 For he took notice of his lowly servant girl, and now generation after generation will call me blessed.49 For he, the Mighty One, is holy, and he has done great things for me.50 His mercy goes on from generation to generation, to all who fear him.51 His mighty arm does tremendous things! How he scatters the proud and haughty ones!52 He has taken princes from their thrones and exalted the lowly.53 He has satisfied the hungry with good things and sent the rich away with empty hands.54 And how he has helped his servant Israel! He has not forgotten his promise to be merciful.55 For he promised our ancestors--Abraham and his children-- to be merciful to them forever."56Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then went back to her own home.57Now it was time for Elizabeth's baby to be born, and it was a boy.  58The word spread quickly to her neighbors and relatives that the Lord had been very kind to her, and everyone rejoiced with her.59When the baby was eight days old, all the relatives and friends came for the circumcision ceremony. They wanted to name him Zechariah, after his father.  60But Elizabeth said, "No! His name is John!"61"What?" they exclaimed. "There is no one in all your family by that name."  62So they asked the baby's father, communicating to him by making gestures.  63He motioned for a writing tablet, and to everyone's surprise he wrote, "His name is John!"  64Instantly Zechariah could speak again, and he began praising God.65Wonder fell upon the whole neighborhood, and the news of what had happened spread throughout the Judean hills.  66Everyone who heard about it reflected on these events and asked, "I wonder what this child will turn out to be? For the hand of the Lord is surely upon him in a special way."67Then his father, Zechariah, was filled with the Holy Spirit and gave this prophecy:68 "Praise the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has visited his people and redeemed them.69 He has sent us a mighty Savior from the royal line of his servant David,70 just as he promised through his holy prophets long ago.71 Now we will be saved from our enemies and from all who hate us.72 He has been merciful to our ancestors by remembering his sacred covenant with them,73 the covenant he gave to our ancestor Abraham.74 We have been rescued from our enemies, so we can serve God without fear,75 in holiness and righteousness forever.76 "And you, my little son, will be called the prophet of the Most High, because you will prepare the way for the Lord.77 You will tell his people how to find salvation through forgiveness of their sins.78 Because of God's tender mercy, the light from heaven is about to break upon us,79 to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, and to guide us to the path of peace."80John grew up and became strong in spirit. Then he lived out in the wilderness until he began his public ministry to Israel.
