1One day Jesus said to his disciples, "There will always be temptations to sin, but how terrible it will be for the person who does the tempting.  2It would be better to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around the neck than to face the punishment in store for harming one of these little ones.  3I am warning you! If another believer[a] sins, rebuke him; then if he repents, forgive him.  4Even if he wrongs you seven times a day and each time turns again and asks forgiveness, forgive him."5One day the apostles said to the Lord, "We need more faith; tell us how to get it."6"Even if you had faith as small as a mustard seed," the Lord answered, "you could say to this mulberry tree, `May God uproot you and throw you into the sea,' and it would obey you!7"When a servant comes in from plowing or taking care of sheep, he doesn't just sit down and eat.  8He must first prepare his master's meal and serve him his supper before eating his own.  9And the servant is not even thanked, because he is merely doing what he is supposed to do.  10In the same way, when you obey me you should say, `We are not worthy of praise. We are servants who have simply done our duty.' "11As Jesus continued on toward Jerusalem, he reached the border between Galilee and Samaria.  12As he entered a village there, ten lepers stood at a distance,  13crying out, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"14He looked at them and said, "Go show yourselves to the priests." And as they went, their leprosy disappeared.15One of them, when he saw that he was healed, came back to Jesus, shouting, "Praise God, I'm healed!" 16He fell face down on the ground at Jesus' feet, thanking him for what he had done. This man was a Samaritan.17Jesus asked, "Didn't I heal ten men? Where are the other nine?  18Does only this foreigner return to give glory to God?"  19And Jesus said to the man, "Stand up and go. Your faith has made you well."20One day the Pharisees asked Jesus, "When will the Kingdom of God come?"ÊJesus replied, "The Kingdom of God isn't ushered in with visible signs.[b]  21You won't be able to say, `Here it is!' or `It's over there!' For the Kingdom of God is among you.[c]"22Later he talked again about this with his disciples. "The time is coming when you will long to share in the days of the Son of Man, but you won't be able to," he said.  23"Reports will reach you that the Son of Man has returned and that he is in this place or that. Don't believe such reports or go out to look for him.  24For when the Son of Man returns, you will know it beyond all doubt. It will be as evident as the lightning that flashes across the sky.  25But first the Son of Man must suffer terribly[d] and be rejected by this generation.26"When the Son of Man returns, the world will be like the people were in Noah's day.  27In those days before the flood, the people enjoyed banquets and parties and weddings right up to the time Noah entered his boat and the flood came to destroy them all.28"And the world will be as it was in the days of Lot. People went about their daily business--eating and drinking, buying and selling, farming and building--  29until the morning Lot left Sodom. Then fire and burning sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.  30Yes, it will be `business as usual' right up to the hour when the Son of Man returns.[e]  31On that day a person outside the house[f] must not go into the house to pack. A person in the field must not return to town.  32Remember what happened to Lot's wife!  33Whoever clings to this life will lose it, and whoever loses this life will save it.  34That night two people will be asleep in one bed; one will be taken away, and the other will be left.  35Two women will be grinding flour together at the mill; one will be taken, the other left.[g]"37"Lord, where will this happen?" the disciples asked.ÊJesus replied, "Just as the gathering of vultures shows there is a carcass nearby, so these signs indicate that the end is near."[h]
