1It was now the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius, the Roman emperor. Pilate was governor over Judea; Herod Antipas was ruler[a] over Galilee; his brother Philip was ruler[b] over Iturea and Traconitis; Lysanias was ruler over Abilene.  2Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests. At this time a message from God came to John son of Zechariah, who was living out in the wilderness.  3Then John went from place to place on both sides of the Jordan River, preaching that people should be baptized to show that they had turned from their sins and turned to God to be forgiven.[c]  4Isaiah had spoken of John when he said, "He is a voice shouting in the wilderness: `Prepare a pathway for the Lord's coming! Make a straight road for him!5 Fill in the valleys, and level the mountains and hills! Straighten the curves, and smooth out the rough places!6 And then all people will see the salvation sent from God.' "[d]7Here is a sample of John's preaching to the crowds that came for baptism: "You brood of snakes! Who warned you to flee God's coming judgment?  8Prove by the way you live that you have really turned from your sins and turned to God. Don't just say, `We're safe--we're the descendants of Abraham.' That proves nothing. God can change these stones here into children of Abraham.  9Even now the ax of God's judgment is poised, ready to sever your roots. Yes, every tree that does not produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown into the fire."10The crowd asked, "What should we do?"11John replied, "If you have two coats, give one to the poor. If you have food, share it with those who are hungry."12Even corrupt tax collectors came to be baptized and asked, "Teacher, what should we do?"13"Show your honesty," he replied. "Make sure you collect no more taxes than the Roman government requires you to."14"What should we do?" asked some soldiers.ÊJohn replied, "Don't extort money, and don't accuse people of things you know they didn't do. And be content with your pay."15Everyone was expecting the Messiah to come soon, and they were eager to know whether John might be the Messiah.  16John answered their questions by saying, "I baptize with[e] water; but someone is coming soon who is greater than I am--so much greater that I am not even worthy to be his slave.[f] He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.[g]  17He is ready to separate the chaff from the grain with his winnowing fork. Then he will clean up the threshing area, storing the grain in his barn but burning the chaff with never-ending fire."  18John used many such warnings as he announced the Good News to the people.19John also publicly criticized Herod Antipas, ruler of Galilee, for marrying Herodias, his brother's wife, and for many other wrongs he had done.  20So Herod put John in prison, adding this sin to his many others.21One day when the crowds were being baptized, Jesus himself was baptized. As he was praying, the heavens opened,  22and the Holy Spirit descended on him in the form of a dove. And a voice from heaven said, "You are my beloved Son, and I am fully pleased with you.[h]"23Jesus was about thirty years old when he began his public ministry. Jesus was known as the son of Joseph.
