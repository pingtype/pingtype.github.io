1Then Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, left the Jordan River. He was led by the Spirit to go out into the wilderness,  2where the Devil tempted him for forty days. He ate nothing all that time and was very hungry.3Then the Devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God, change this stone into a loaf of bread."4But Jesus told him, "No! The Scriptures say, `People need more than bread for their life.'[a] "5Then the Devil took him up and revealed to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.  6The Devil told him, "I will give you the glory of these kingdoms and authority over them--because they are mine to give to anyone I please.  7I will give it all to you if you will bow down and worship me."8Jesus replied, "The Scriptures say, `You must worship the Lord your God; serve only him.'[b] "9Then the Devil took him to Jerusalem, to the highest point of the Temple, and said, "If you are the Son of God, jump off!  10For the Scriptures say, `He orders his angels to protect and guard you.11 And they will hold you with their hands to keep you from striking your foot on a stone.'[c] "12Jesus responded, "The Scriptures also say, `Do not test the Lord your God.'[d] "13When the Devil had finished tempting Jesus, he left him until the next opportunity came.14Then Jesus returned to Galilee, filled with the Holy Spirit's power. Soon he became well known throughout the surrounding country.  15He taught in their synagogues and was praised by everyone.16When he came to the village of Nazareth, his boyhood home, he went as usual to the synagogue on the Sabbath and stood up to read the Scriptures.  17The scroll containing the messages of Isaiah the prophet was handed to him, and he unrolled the scroll to the place where it says:18 "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he has appointed me to preach Good News to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim that captives will be released, that the blind will see, that the downtrodden will be freed from their oppressors,19 and that the time of the Lord's favor has come.[e]"20He rolled up the scroll, handed it back to the attendant, and sat down. Everyone in the synagogue stared at him intently.  21Then he said, "This Scripture has come true today before your very eyes!"22All who were there spoke well of him and were amazed by the gracious words that fell from his lips. "How can this be?" they asked. "Isn't this Joseph's son?"23Then he said, "Probably you will quote me that proverb, `Physician, heal yourself'--meaning, `Why don't you do miracles here in your hometown like those you did in Capernaum?'  24But the truth is, no prophet is accepted in his own hometown.25"Certainly there were many widows in Israel who needed help in Elijah's time, when there was no rain for three and a half years and hunger stalked the land.  26Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them. He was sent instead to a widow of Zarephath--a foreigner in the land of Sidon.  27Or think of the prophet Elisha, who healed Naaman, a Syrian, rather than the many lepers in Israel who needed help."28When they heard this, the people in the synagogue were furious.  29Jumping up, they mobbed him and took him to the edge of the hill on which the city was built. They intended to push him over the cliff,  30but he slipped away through the crowd and left them.31Then Jesus went to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and taught there in the synagogue every Sabbath day. 32There, too, the people were amazed at the things he said, because he spoke with authority.33Once when he was in the synagogue, a man possessed by a demon began shouting at Jesus,  34"Go away! Why are you bothering us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One sent from God."35Jesus cut him short. "Be silent!" he told the demon. "Come out of the man!" The demon threw the man to the floor as the crowd watched; then it left him without hurting him further.36Amazed, the people exclaimed, "What authority and power this man's words possess! Even evil spirits obey him and flee at his command!"  37The story of what he had done spread like wildfire throughout the whole region.38After leaving the synagogue that day, Jesus went to Simon's home, where he found Simon's mother-in-law very sick with a high fever. "Please heal her," everyone begged.  39Standing at her bedside, he spoke to the fever, rebuking it, and immediately her temperature returned to normal. She got up at once and prepared a meal for them.40As the sun went down that evening, people throughout the village brought sick family members to Jesus. No matter what their diseases were, the touch of his hand healed every one.  41Some were possessed by demons; and the demons came out at his command, shouting, "You are the Son of God." But because they knew he was the Messiah, he stopped them and told them to be silent.42Early the next morning Jesus went out into the wilderness. The crowds searched everywhere for him, and when they finally found him, they begged him not to leave them.  43But he replied, "I must preach the Good News of the Kingdom of God in other places, too, because that is why I was sent."  44So he continued to travel around, preaching in synagogues throughout Judea.[f]
