1But very early on Sunday morning[a] the women came to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared. 2They found that the stone covering the entrance had been rolled aside.  3So they went in, but they couldn't find the body of the Lord Jesus.  4They were puzzled, trying to think what could have happened to it. Suddenly, two men appeared to them, clothed in dazzling robes.  5The women were terrified and bowed low before them. Then the men asked, "Why are you looking in a tomb for someone who is alive?  6He isn't here! He has risen from the dead! Don't you remember what he told you back in Galilee,  7that the Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of sinful men and be crucified, and that he would rise again the third day?"8Then they remembered that he had said this.  9So they rushed back to tell his eleven disciples--and everyone else--what had happened.  10The women who went to the tomb were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and several others. They told the apostles what had happened,  11but the story sounded like nonsense, so they didn't believe it.  12However, Peter ran to the tomb to look. Stooping, he peered in and saw the empty linen wrappings; then he went home again, wondering what had happened.[b]13That same day two of Jesus' followers were walking to the village of Emmaus, seven miles[c] out of Jerusalem.  14As they walked along they were talking about everything that had happened.  15Suddenly, Jesus himself came along and joined them and began walking beside them.  16But they didn't know who he was, because God kept them from recognizing him.17"You seem to be in a deep discussion about something," he said. "What are you so concerned about?"ÊThey stopped short, sadness written across their faces.  18Then one of them, Cleopas, replied, "You must be the only person in Jerusalem who hasn't heard about all the things that have happened there the last few days."19"What things?" Jesus asked.Ê"The things that happened to Jesus, the man from Nazareth," they said. "He was a prophet who did wonderful miracles. He was a mighty teacher, highly regarded by both God and all the people.  20But our leading priests and other religious leaders arrested him and handed him over to be condemned to death, and they crucified him.  21We had thought he was the Messiah who had come to rescue Israel. That all happened three days ago.  22Then some women from our group of his followers were at his tomb early this morning, and they came back with an amazing report.  23They said his body was missing, and they had seen angels who told them Jesus is alive!  24Some of our men ran out to see, and sure enough, Jesus' body was gone, just as the women had said."25Then Jesus said to them, "You are such foolish people! You find it so hard to believe all that the prophets wrote in the Scriptures.  26Wasn't it clearly predicted by the prophets that the Messiah would have to suffer all these things before entering his time of glory?"  27Then Jesus quoted passages from the writings of Moses and all the prophets, explaining what all the Scriptures said about himself.28By this time they were nearing Emmaus and the end of their journey. Jesus would have gone on,  29but they begged him to stay the night with them, since it was getting late. So he went home with them.  30As they sat down to eat, he took a small loaf of bread, asked God's blessing on it, broke it, then gave it to them. 31Suddenly, their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And at that moment he disappeared!32They said to each other, "Didn't our hearts feel strangely warm as he talked with us on the road and explained the Scriptures to us?"  33And within the hour they were on their way back to Jerusalem, where the eleven disciples and the other followers of Jesus were gathered. When they arrived, they were greeted with the report,  34"The Lord has really risen! He appeared to Peter[d]!"35Then the two from Emmaus told their story of how Jesus had appeared to them as they were walking along the road and how they had recognized him as he was breaking the bread.  36And just as they were telling about it, Jesus himself was suddenly standing there among them. He said, "Peace be with you."[e]  37But the whole group was terribly frightened, thinking they were seeing a ghost!  38"Why are you frightened?" he asked. "Why do you doubt who I am?  39Look at my hands. Look at my feet. You can see that it's really me. Touch me and make sure that I am not a ghost, because ghosts don't have bodies, as you see that I do!" 40As he spoke, he held out his hands for them to see, and he showed them his feet.[f]41Still they stood there doubting, filled with joy and wonder. Then he asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"  42They gave him a piece of broiled fish,  43and he ate it as they watched.44Then he said, "When I was with you before, I told you that everything written about me by Moses and the prophets and in the Psalms must all come true."  45Then he opened their minds to understand these many Scriptures.  46And he said, "Yes, it was written long ago that the Messiah must suffer and die and rise again from the dead on the third day.  47With my authority, take this message of repentance to all the nations, beginning in Jerusalem: `There is forgiveness of sins for all who turn to me.'  48You are witnesses of all these things.49"And now I will send the Holy Spirit, just as my Father promised. But stay here in the city until the Holy Spirit comes and fills you with power from heaven."50Then Jesus led them to Bethany, and lifting his hands to heaven, he blessed them.  51While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up to heaven.[g]  52They worshiped him and[h] then returned to Jerusalem filled with great joy.  53And they spent all of their time in the Temple, praising God.
