1And so, dear brothers and sisters who belong to God[a] and are bound for heaven, think about this Jesus whom we declare to be God's Messenger and High Priest.  2For he was faithful to God, who appointed him, just as Moses served faithfully and was entrusted with God's entire house.  3But Jesus deserves far more glory than Moses, just as a person who builds a fine house deserves more praise than the house itself.  4For every house has a builder, but God is the one who made everything.5Moses was certainly faithful in God's house, but only as a servant. His work was an illustration of the truths God would reveal later.  6But Christ, the faithful Son, was in charge of the entire household. And we are God's household, if we keep up our courage and remain confident in our hope in Christ.  7That is why the Holy Spirit says, "Today you must listen to his voice.8 Don't harden your hearts against him as Israel did when they rebelled, when they tested God's patience in the wilderness.9 There your ancestors tried my patience, even though they saw my miracles for forty years.10 So I was angry with them, and I said, `Their hearts always turn away from me. They refuse to do what I tell them.'11 So in my anger I made a vow: `They will never enter my place of rest.' "[b]12Be careful then, dear brothers and sisters.[c] Make sure that your own hearts are not evil and unbelieving, turning you away from the living God.  13You must warn each other every day, as long as it is called "today," so that none of you will be deceived by sin and hardened against God.  14For if we are faithful to the end, trusting God just as firmly as when we first believed, we will share in all that belongs to Christ. 15But never forget the warning: "Today you must listen to his voice. Don't harden your hearts against him as Israel did when they rebelled."[d]16And who were those people who rebelled against God, even though they heard his voice? Weren't they the ones Moses led out of Egypt?  17And who made God angry for forty years? Wasn't it the people who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?  18And to whom was God speaking when he vowed that they would never enter his place of rest? He was speaking to those who disobeyed him.  19So we see that they were not allowed to enter his rest because of their unbelief.
