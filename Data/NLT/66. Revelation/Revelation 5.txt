1And I saw a scroll in the right hand of the one who was sitting on the throne. There was writing on the inside and the outside of the scroll, and it was sealed with seven seals.  2And I saw a strong angel, who shouted with a loud voice: "Who is worthy to break the seals on this scroll and unroll it?"  3But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll and read it.4Then I wept because no one could be found who was worthy to open the scroll and read it.  5But one of the twenty-four elders said to me, "Stop weeping! Look, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the heir to David's throne,[a] has conquered. He is worthy to open the scroll and break its seven seals."6I looked and I saw a Lamb that had been killed but was now standing between the throne and the four living beings and among the twenty-four elders. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits[b] of God that are sent out into every part of the earth.  7He stepped forward and took the scroll from the right hand of the one sitting on the throne.  8And as he took the scroll, the four living beings and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp, and they held gold bowls filled with incense--the prayers of God's people!9And they sang a new song with these words: "You are worthy to take the scroll and break its seals and open it. For you were killed, and your blood has ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation.10 And you have caused them to become God's Kingdom and his priests. And they will reign[c] on the earth."11Then I looked again, and I heard the singing of thousands and millions of angels around the throne and the living beings and the elders.  12And they sang in a mighty chorus: "The Lamb is worthy--the Lamb who was killed. He is worthy to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing."13And then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea. They also sang: "Blessing and honor and glory and power belong to the one sitting on the throne and to the Lamb forever and ever."14And the four living beings said, "Amen!" And the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped God and the Lamb.
