[The Message to the Church in Sardis] 1 "Write this letter to the angel* of the church in Sardis. This is the message from the one who has the sevenfold Spirit* of God and the seven stars:  "I know all the things you do, and that you have a reputation for being alive-but you are dead.  2 Wake up! Strengthen what little remains, for even what is left is almost dead. I find that your actions do not meet the requirements of my God.  3 Go back to what you heard and believed at first; hold to it firmly. Repent and turn to me again. If you don't wake up, I will come to you suddenly, as unexpected as a thief. 4 "Yet there are some in the church in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes with evil. They will walk with me in white, for they are worthy.  5 All who are victorious will be clothed in white. I will never erase their names from the Book of Life, but I will announce before my Father and his angels that they are mine. 6 "Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches.  [The Message to the Church in Philadelphia] 7 "Write this letter to the angel of the church in Philadelphia.  This is the message from the one who is holy and true,  the one who has the key of David.  What he opens, no one can close;  and what he closes, no one can open:*"I know all the things you do, and I have opened a door for you that no one can close. You have little strength, yet you obeyed my word and did not deny me.  9 Look, I will force those who belong to Satan's synagogue-those liars who say they are Jews but are not-to come and bow down at your feet. They will acknowledge that you are the ones I love. 10 "Because you have obeyed my command to persevere, I will protect you from the great time of testing that will come upon the whole world to test those who belong to this world.  11 I am coming soon.* Hold on to what you have, so that no one will take away your crown.  12 All who are victorious will become pillars in the Temple of my God, and they will never have to leave it. And I will write on them the name of my God, and they will be citizens in the city of my God-the new Jerusalem that comes down from heaven from my God. And I will also write on them my new name. 13 "Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches.  [The Message to the Church in Laodicea] 14 "Write this letter to the angel of the church in Laodicea. This is the message from the one who is the Amen-the faithful and true witness, the beginning* of God's new creation: 15 "I know all the things you do, that you are neither hot nor cold. I wish that you were one or the other!  16 But since you are like lukewarm water, neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth!  17 You say, "I am rich. I have everything I want. I don't need a thing!' And you don't realize that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.  18 So I advise you to buy gold from me-gold that has been purified by fire. Then you will be rich. Also buy white garments from me so you will not be shamed by your nakedness, and ointment for your eyes so you will be able to see.  19 I correct and discipline everyone I love. So be diligent and turn from your indifference. 20 "Look! I stand at the door and knock. If you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in, and we will share a meal together as friends.  21 Those who are victorious will sit with me on my throne, just as I was victorious and sat with my Father on his throne. 22 "Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches."        Footnotes: 3:1a Or the messenger; also in 3:7, 14.   3:1b Greek the seven spirits.   3:7 Isa 22:22.  8  3:11 Or suddenly , or quickly.   3:14 Or the ruler, or the source.
