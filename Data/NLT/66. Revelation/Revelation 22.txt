1 And the angel showed me a pure river with the water of life, clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb,  2coursing down the center of the main street. On each side of the river grew a tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit,[a] with a fresh crop each month. The leaves were used for medicine to heal the nations.3No longer will anything be cursed. For the throne of God and of the Lamb will be there, and his servants will worship him.  4And they will see his face, and his name will be written on their foreheads.  5And there will be no night there--no need for lamps or sun--for the Lord God will shine on them. And they will reign forever and ever.6Then the angel said to me, "These words are trustworthy and true: `The Lord God, who tells his prophets what the future holds, has sent his angel to tell you what will happen soon.' "7"Look, I am coming soon! Blessed are those who obey the prophecy written in this scroll."8I, John, am the one who saw and heard all these things. And when I saw and heard these things, I fell down to worship the angel who showed them to me.  9But again he said, "No, don't worship me. I am a servant of God, just like you and your brothers the prophets, as well as all who obey what is written in this scroll. Worship God!"10Then he instructed me, "Do not seal up the prophetic words you have written, for the time is near.  11Let the one who is doing wrong continue to do wrong; the one who is vile, continue to be vile; the one who is good, continue to do good; and the one who is holy, continue in holiness."12"See, I am coming soon, and my reward is with me, to repay all according to their deeds.  13I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End."14Blessed are those who wash their robes so they can enter through the gates of the city and eat the fruit from the tree of life.  15Outside the city are the dogs--the sorcerers, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idol worshipers, and all who love to live a lie.16"I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this message for the churches. I am both the source of David and the heir to his throne.[b] I am the bright morning star."17The Spirit and the bride say, "Come." Let each one who hears them say, "Come." Let the thirsty ones come--anyone who wants to. Let them come and drink the water of life without charge.  18And I solemnly declare to everyone who hears the prophetic words of this book: If anyone adds anything to what is written here, God will add to that person the plagues described in this book.  19And if anyone removes any of the words of this prophetic book, God will remove that person's share in the tree of life and in the holy city that are described in this book.20He who is the faithful witness to all these things says, "Yes, I am coming soon!" Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!21The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you all.
