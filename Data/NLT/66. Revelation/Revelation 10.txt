1Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, surrounded by a cloud, with a rainbow over his head. His face shone like the sun, and his feet were like pillars of fire.  2And in his hand was a small scroll, which he had unrolled. He stood with his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land.  3And he gave a great shout, like the roar of a lion. And when he shouted, the seven thunders answered.4When the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write. But a voice from heaven called to me: "Keep secret what the seven thunders said. Do not write it down."5Then the mighty angel standing on the sea and on the land lifted his right hand to heaven.  6And he swore an oath in the name of the one who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and everything in it, the earth and everything in it, and the sea and everything in it. He said, "God will wait no longer.  7But when the seventh angel blows his trumpet, God's mysterious plan will be fulfilled. It will happen just as he announced it to his servants the prophets."8Then the voice from heaven called to me again: "Go and take the unrolled scroll from the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land."9So I approached him and asked him to give me the little scroll. "Yes, take it and eat it," he said. "At first it will taste like honey, but when you swallow it, it will make your stomach sour!"  10So I took the little scroll from the hands of the angel, and I ate it! It was sweet in my mouth, but it made my stomach sour.  11Then he said to me, "You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings."
