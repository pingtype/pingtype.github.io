1When Jesus had finished saying these things, he said to his disciples,  2"As you know, the Passover celebration begins in two days, and I, the Son of Man, will be betrayed and crucified."3At that same time the leading priests and other leaders were meeting at the residence of Caiaphas, the high priest,  4to discuss how to capture Jesus secretly and put him to death.  5"But not during the Passover," they agreed, "or there will be a riot."6Meanwhile, Jesus was in Bethany at the home of Simon, a man who had leprosy.  7During supper, a woman came in with a beautiful jar[a] of expensive perfume and poured it over his head.  8The disciples were indignant when they saw this. "What a waste of money," they said.  9"She could have sold it for a fortune and given the money to the poor."10But Jesus replied, "Why berate her for doing such a good thing to me?  11You will always have the poor among you, but I will not be here with you much longer.  12She has poured this perfume on me to prepare my body for burial.  13I assure you, wherever the Good News is preached throughout the world, this woman's deed will be talked about in her memory."14Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, went to the leading priests  15and asked, "How much will you pay me to betray Jesus to you?" And they gave him thirty pieces of silver.  16From that time on, Judas began looking for the right time and place to betray Jesus.17On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover supper?"18"As you go into the city," he told them, "you will see a certain man. Tell him, `The Teacher says, My time has come, and I will eat the Passover meal with my disciples at your house.' "  19So the disciples did as Jesus told them and prepared the Passover supper there.20When it was evening, Jesus sat down at the table with the twelve disciples.  21While they were eating, he said, "The truth is, one of you will betray me."22Greatly distressed, one by one they began to ask him, "I'm not the one, am I, Lord?"23He replied, "One of you who is eating with me now[b] will betray me.  24For I, the Son of Man, must die, as the Scriptures declared long ago. But how terrible it will be for my betrayer. Far better for him if he had never been born!"25Judas, the one who would betray him, also asked, "Teacher, I'm not the one, am I?" And Jesus told him, "You have said it yourself."26As they were eating, Jesus took a loaf of bread and asked God's blessing on it. Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples, saying, "Take it and eat it, for this is my body."  27And he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it. He gave it to them and said, "Each of you drink from it,  28for this is my blood, which seals the covenant[c] between God and his people. It is poured out to forgive the sins of many. 29Mark my words--I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new with you in my Father's Kingdom." 30Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.31"Tonight all of you will desert me," Jesus told them. "For the Scriptures say, `God[d] will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'[e]32But after I have been raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you to Galilee and meet you there."33Peter declared, "Even if everyone else deserts you, I never will."34"Peter," Jesus replied, "the truth is, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."35"No!" Peter insisted. "Not even if I have to die with you! I will never deny you!" And all the other disciples vowed the same.36Then Jesus brought them to an olive grove called Gethsemane, and he said, "Sit here while I go on ahead to pray."  37He took Peter and Zebedee's two sons, James and John, and he began to be filled with anguish and deep distress.  38He told them, "My soul is crushed with grief to the point of death. Stay here and watch with me."39He went on a little farther and fell face down on the ground, praying, "My Father! If it is possible, let this cup of suffering be taken away from me. Yet I want your will, not mine."  40Then he returned to the disciples and found them asleep. He said to Peter, "Couldn't you stay awake and watch with me even one hour? 41Keep alert and pray. Otherwise temptation will overpower you. For though the spirit is willing enough, the body is weak!"42Again he left them and prayed, "My Father! If this cup cannot be taken away until I drink it, your will be done."  43He returned to them again and found them sleeping, for they just couldn't keep their eyes open.44So he went back to pray a third time, saying the same things again.  45Then he came to the disciples and said, "Still sleeping? Still resting?[f] Look, the time has come. I, the Son of Man, am betrayed into the hands of sinners.  46Up, let's be going. See, my betrayer is here!"47And even as he said this, Judas, one of the twelve disciples, arrived with a mob that was armed with swords and clubs. They had been sent out by the leading priests and other leaders of the people.  48Judas had given them a prearranged signal: "You will know which one to arrest when I go over and give him the kiss of greeting."  49So Judas came straight to Jesus. "Greetings, Teacher!" he exclaimed and gave him the kiss.50Jesus said, "My friend, go ahead and do what you have come for." Then the others grabbed Jesus and arrested him.  51One of the men with Jesus pulled out a sword and slashed off an ear of the high priest's servant.52"Put away your sword," Jesus told him. "Those who use the sword will be killed by the sword.  53Don't you realize that I could ask my Father for thousands[g] of angels to protect us, and he would send them instantly?  54But if I did, how would the Scriptures be fulfilled that describe what must happen now?"55Then Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I some dangerous criminal, that you have come armed with swords and clubs to arrest me? Why didn't you arrest me in the Temple? I was there teaching every day.  56But this is all happening to fulfill the words of the prophets as recorded in the Scriptures." At that point, all the disciples deserted him and fled.57Then the people who had arrested Jesus led him to the home of Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of religious law and other leaders had gathered.  58Meanwhile, Peter was following far behind and eventually came to the courtyard of the high priest's house. He went in, sat with the guards, and waited to see what was going to happen to Jesus.59Inside, the leading priests and the entire high council[h] were trying to find witnesses who would lie about Jesus, so they could put him to death.  60But even though they found many who agreed to give false witness, there was no testimony they could use. Finally, two men were found  61who declared, "This man said, `I am able to destroy the Temple of God and rebuild it in three days.' "62Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Well, aren't you going to answer these charges? What do you have to say for yourself?"  63But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said to him, "I demand in the name of the living God that you tell us whether you are the Messiah, the Son of God."64Jesus replied, "Yes, it is as you say. And in the future you will see me, the Son of Man, sitting at God's right hand in the place of power and coming back on the clouds of heaven."[i]65Then the high priest tore his clothing to show his horror, shouting, "Blasphemy! Why do we need other witnesses? You have all heard his blasphemy.  66What is your verdict?" "Guilty!" they shouted. "He must die!"67Then they spit in Jesus' face and hit him with their fists. And some slapped him,  68saying, "Prophesy to us, you Messiah! Who hit you that time?"69Meanwhile, as Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, a servant girl came over and said to him, "You were one of those with Jesus the Galilean."70But Peter denied it in front of everyone. "I don't know what you are talking about," he said.71Later, out by the gate, another servant girl noticed him and said to those standing around, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."72Again Peter denied it, this time with an oath. "I don't even know the man," he said.73A little later some other bystanders came over to him and said, "You must be one of them; we can tell by your Galilean accent."74Peter said, "I swear by God, I don't know the man." And immediately the rooster crowed.  75Suddenly, Jesus' words flashed through Peter's mind: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went away, crying bitterly.
