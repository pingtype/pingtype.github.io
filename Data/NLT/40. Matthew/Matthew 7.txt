1"Stop judging others, and you will not be judged.  2For others will treat you as you treat them.[a] Whatever measure you use in judging others, it will be used to measure how you are judged.  3And why worry about a speck in your friend's eye[b] when you have a log in your own?  4How can you think of saying, `Let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye,' when you can't see past the log in your own eye?  5Hypocrite! First get rid of the log from your own eye; then perhaps you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye.6"Don't give what is holy to unholy people.[c] Don't give pearls to swine! They will trample the pearls, then turn and attack you.7"Keep on asking, and you will be given what you ask for. Keep on looking, and you will find. Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened.  8For everyone who asks, receives. Everyone who seeks, finds. And the door is opened to everyone who knocks.  9You parents--if your children ask for a loaf of bread, do you give them a stone instead?  10Or if they ask for a fish, do you give them a snake? Of course not!  11If you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good gifts to those who ask him.12"Do for others what you would like them to do for you. This is a summary of all that is taught in the law and the prophets.13"You can enter God's Kingdom only through the narrow gate. The highway to hell[d] is broad, and its gate is wide for the many who choose the easy way.  14But the gateway to life is small, and the road is narrow, and only a few ever find it.15"Beware of false prophets who come disguised as harmless sheep, but are really wolves that will tear you apart.  16You can detect them by the way they act, just as you can identify a tree by its fruit. You don't pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles.  17A healthy tree produces good fruit, and an unhealthy tree produces bad fruit.  18A good tree can't produce bad fruit, and a bad tree can't produce good fruit.  19So every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire.  20Yes, the way to identify a tree or a person is by the kind of fruit that is produced.21"Not all people who sound religious are really godly. They may refer to me as `Lord,' but they still won't enter the Kingdom of Heaven. The decisive issue is whether they obey my Father in heaven.  22On judgment day many will tell me, `Lord, Lord, we prophesied in your name and cast out demons in your name and performed many miracles in your name.'  23But I will reply, `I never knew you. Go away; the things you did were unauthorized.[e]'24"Anyone who listens to my teaching and obeys me is wise, like a person who builds a house on solid rock. 25Though the rain comes in torrents and the floodwaters rise and the winds beat against that house, it won't collapse, because it is built on rock.  26But anyone who hears my teaching and ignores it is foolish, like a person who builds a house on sand.  27When the rains and floods come and the winds beat against that house, it will fall with a mighty crash."28After Jesus finished speaking, the crowds were amazed at his teaching,  29for he taught as one who had real authority--quite unlike the teachers of religious law.
