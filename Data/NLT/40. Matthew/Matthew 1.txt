Mary was the mother of Jesus, who is called the Messiah.17All those listed above include fourteen generations from Abraham to King David, and fourteen from David's time to the Babylonian exile, and fourteen from the Babylonian exile to the Messiah.18Now this is how Jesus the Messiah was born. His mother, Mary, was engaged to be married to Joseph. But while she was still a virgin, she became pregnant by the Holy Spirit.  19Joseph, her fiance, being a just man, decided to break the engagement quietly, so as not to disgrace her publicly.20As he considered this, he fell asleep, and an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. "Joseph, son of David," the angel said, "do not be afraid to go ahead with your marriage to Mary. For the child within her has been conceived by the Holy Spirit.  21And she will have a son, and you are to name him Jesus,[g] for he will save his people from their sins."  22All of this happened to fulfill the Lord's message through his prophet:23 "Look! The virgin will conceive a child! She will give birth to a son, and he will be called Immanuel[h] (meaning, God is with us)."24When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord commanded. He brought Mary home to be his wife,  25but she remained a virgin until her son was born. And Joseph named him Jesus.
