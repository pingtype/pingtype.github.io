1Then Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.[a]  
2There he became acquainted with a Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, who had recently arrived from Italy with his wife, Priscilla. They had been expelled from Italy as a result of Claudius Caesar's order to deport all Jews from Rome.  
3Paul lived and worked with them, for they were tentmakers[b] just as he was.
4Each Sabbath found Paul at the synagogue, trying to convince the Jews and Greeks alike.  
5And after Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul spent his full time preaching and testifying to the Jews, telling them, "The Messiah you are looking for is Jesus."  
6But when the Jews opposed him and insulted him, Paul shook the dust from his robe and said, "Your blood be upon your own heads--I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles."
7After that he stayed with Titius Justus, a Gentile who worshiped God and lived next door to the synagogue.  
8Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, and all his household believed in the Lord. Many others in Corinth also became believers and were baptized.
9One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision and told him, "Don't be afraid! Speak out! Don't be silent! 10For I am with you, and no one will harm you because many people here in this city belong to me."  
11So Paul stayed there for the next year and a half, teaching the word of God.
12But when Gallio became governor of Achaia, some Jews rose in concerted action against Paul and brought him before the governor for judgment.  
13They accused Paul of "persuading people to worship God in ways that are contrary to the law."  
14But just as Paul started to make his defense, Gallio turned to Paul's accusers and said, "Listen, you Jews, if this were a case involving some wrongdoing or a serious crime, I would be obliged to listen to you.  
15But since it is merely a question of words and names and your Jewish laws, you take care of it. I refuse to judge such matters."  
16And he drove them out of the courtroom.  
17The mob had grabbed Sosthenes, the leader of the synagogue, and had beaten him right there in the courtroom. But Gallio paid no attention.
18Paul stayed in Corinth for some time after that and then said good-bye to the brothers and sisters[c] and sailed for the coast of Syria, taking Priscilla and Aquila with him. (Earlier, at Cenchrea, Paul had shaved his head according to Jewish custom, for he had taken a vow.)  
19When they arrived at the port of Ephesus, Paul left the others behind. But while he was there, he went to the synagogue to debate with the Jews.  
20They asked him to stay longer, but he declined.  
21So he left, saying, "I will come back later,[d] God willing." Then he set sail from Ephesus.  
22The next stop was at the port of Caesarea. From there he went up and visited the church at Jerusalem[e] and then went back to Antioch.
23After spending some time in Antioch, Paul went back to Galatia and Phrygia, visiting all the believers,[f] encouraging them and helping them to grow in the Lord.
24Meanwhile, a Jew named Apollos, an eloquent speaker who knew the Scriptures well, had just arrived in Ephesus from Alexandria in Egypt.  
25He had been taught the way of the Lord and talked to others with great enthusiasm and accuracy about Jesus. However, he knew only about John's baptism.  
26When Priscilla and Aquila heard him preaching boldly in the synagogue, they took him aside and explained the way of God more accurately.
27Apollos had been thinking about going to Achaia, and the brothers and sisters in Ephesus encouraged him in this. They wrote to the believers in Achaia, asking them to welcome him. When he arrived there, he proved to be of great benefit to those who, by God's grace, had believed.  
28He refuted all the Jews with powerful arguments in public debate. Using the Scriptures, he explained to them, "The Messiah you are looking for is Jesus."
