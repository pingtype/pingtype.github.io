1This letter is from Paul, Silas,[a] and Timothy. It is written to the church in Thessalonica, you who belong to God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.2May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.3Dear brothers and sisters,[b] we always thank God for you, as is right, for we are thankful that your faith is flourishing and you are all growing in love for each other.  4We proudly tell God's other churches about your endurance and faithfulness in all the persecutions and hardships you are suffering.  5But God will use this persecution to show his justice. For he will make you worthy of his Kingdom, for which you are suffering, 
6and in his justice he will punish those who persecute you.  7And God will provide rest for you who are being persecuted and also for us when the Lord Jesus appears from heaven. He will come with his mighty angels, 
8in flaming fire, bringing judgment on those who don't know God and on those who refuse to obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus.  9They will be punished with everlasting destruction, forever separated from the Lord and from his glorious power  10when he comes to receive glory and praise from his holy people. And you will be among those praising him on that day, for you believed what we testified about him.11And so we keep on praying for you, that our God will make you worthy of the life to which he called you. And we pray that God, by his power, will fulfill all your good intentions and faithful deeds.  12Then everyone will give honor to the name of our Lord Jesus because of you, and you will be honored along with him. This is all made possible because of the undeserved favor of our God and Lord, Jesus Christ.[c]
