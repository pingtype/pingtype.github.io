1And now, brothers and sisters,[a] let us tell you about the coming again of our Lord Jesus Christ and how we will be gathered together to meet him.  2Please don't be so easily shaken and troubled by those who say that the day of the Lord has already begun. Even if they claim to have had a vision, a revelation, or a letter supposedly from us, don't believe them.  3Don't be fooled by what they say.ÊFor that day will not come until there is a great rebellion against God and the man of lawlessness is revealed--the one who brings destruction.[b]  4He will exalt himself and defy every god there is and tear down every object of adoration and worship. He will position himself in the temple of God, claiming that he himself is God.  5Don't you remember that I told you this when I was with you?  6And you know what is holding him back, for he can be revealed only when his time comes.7For this lawlessness is already at work secretly, and it will remain secret until the one who is holding it back steps out of the way.  8Then the man of lawlessness will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will consume with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming.  9This evil man will come to do the work of Satan with counterfeit power and signs and miracles.  10He will use every kind of wicked deception to fool those who are on their way to destruction because they refuse to believe the truth that would save them. 11So God will send great deception upon them, and they will believe all these lies.  12Then they will be condemned for not believing the truth and for enjoying the evil they do.13As for us, we always thank God for you, dear brothers and sisters loved by the Lord. We are thankful that God chose you to be among the first[c] to experience salvation, a salvation that came through the Spirit who makes you holy and by your belief in the truth.  14He called you to salvation when we told you the Good News; now you can share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.15With all these things in mind, dear brothers and sisters, stand firm and keep a strong grip on everything we taught you both in person and by letter.16May our Lord Jesus Christ and God our Father, who loved us and in his special favor gave us everlasting comfort and good hope,  17comfort your hearts and give you strength in every good thing you do and say.
