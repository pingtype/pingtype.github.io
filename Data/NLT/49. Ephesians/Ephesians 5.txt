1Follow God's example in everything you do, because you are his dear children.  
2Live a life filled with love for others, following the example of Christ, who loved you and gave himself as a sacrifice to take away your sins. And God was pleased, because that sacrifice was like sweet perfume to him.
3Let there be no sexual immorality, impurity, or greed among you. Such sins have no place among God's people.  
4Obscene stories, foolish talk, and coarse jokes--these are not for you. Instead, let there be thankfulness to God.  
5You can be sure that no immoral, impure, or greedy person will inherit the Kingdom of Christ and of God. For a greedy person is really an idolater who worships the things of this world.  
6Don't be fooled by those who try to excuse these sins, for the terrible anger of God comes upon all those who disobey him.  
7Don't participate in the things these people do.  
8For though your hearts were once full of darkness, now you are full of light from the Lord, and your behavior should show it!  
9For this light within you produces only what is good and right and true.
10Try to find out what is pleasing to the Lord.  
11Take no part in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness; instead, rebuke and expose them.  
12It is shameful even to talk about the things that ungodly people do in secret.  
13But when the light shines on them, it becomes clear how evil these things are.  
14And where your light shines, it will expose their evil deeds. This is why it is said, "Awake, O sleeper, rise up from the dead, and Christ will give you light."
15So be careful how you live, not as fools but as those who are wise.  
16Make the most of every opportunity for doing good in these evil days.  
17Don't act thoughtlessly, but try to understand what the Lord wants you to do.  
18Don't be drunk with wine, because that will ruin your life. Instead, let the Holy Spirit fill and control you. 
19Then you will sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, making music to the Lord in your hearts.  
20And you will always give thanks for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
21And further, you will submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.  
22You wives will submit to your husbands as you do to the Lord.  
23For a husband is the head of his wife as Christ is the head of his body, the church; he gave his life to be her Savior.  
24As the church submits to Christ, so you wives must submit to your husbands in everything.
25And you husbands must love your wives with the same love Christ showed the church. He gave up his life for her  
26to make her holy and clean, washed by baptism and God's word.[a]  
27He did this to present her to himself as a glorious church without a spot or wrinkle or any other blemish. Instead, she will be holy and without fault.  
28In the same way, husbands ought to love their wives as they love their own bodies. For a man is actually loving himself when he loves his wife.  
29No one hates his own body but lovingly cares for it, just as Christ cares for his body, which is the church.  
30And we are his body.
31As the Scriptures say, "A man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife, and the two are united into one."[b]  
32This is a great mystery, but it is an illustration of the way Christ and the church are one. 
33So again I say, each man must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
