1Children, obey your parents because you belong to the Lord, for this is the right thing to do.  
2"Honor your father and mother." This is the first of the Ten Commandments that ends with a promise.  
3And this is the promise: If you honor your father and mother, "you will live a long life, full of blessing."[a]
4And now a word to you fathers. Don't make your children angry by the way you treat them. Rather, bring them up with the discipline and instruction approved by the Lord.
5Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear. Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ.  
6Work hard, but not just to please your masters when they are watching. As slaves of Christ, do the will of God with all your heart.  
7Work with enthusiasm, as though you were working for the Lord rather than for people.  
8Remember that the Lord will reward each one of us for the good we do, whether we are slaves or free.
9And in the same way, you masters must treat your slaves right. Don't threaten them; remember, you both have the same Master in heaven, and he has no favorites.
10A final word: Be strong with the Lord's mighty power.  
11Put on all of God's armor so that you will be able to stand firm against all strategies and tricks of the Devil.  
12For we are not fighting against people made of flesh and blood, but against the evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world, against those mighty powers of darkness who rule this world, and against wicked spirits in the heavenly realms.
13Use every piece of God's armor to resist the enemy in the time of evil, so that after the battle you will still be standing firm.  
14Stand your ground, putting on the sturdy belt of truth and the body armor of God's righteousness.  
15For shoes, put on the peace that comes from the Good News, so that you will be fully prepared.[b]  
16In every battle you will need faith as your shield to stop the fiery arrows aimed at you by Satan.[c]  
17Put on salvation as your helmet, and take the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. 
18Pray at all times and on every occasion in the power of the Holy Spirit. Stay alert and be persistent in your prayers for all Christians everywhere.
19And pray for me, too. Ask God to give me the right words as I boldly explain God's secret plan that the Good News is for the Gentiles, too.[d]  
20I am in chains now for preaching this message as God's ambassador. But pray that I will keep on speaking boldly for him, as I should.
21Tychicus, a much loved brother and faithful helper in the Lord's work, will tell you all about how I am getting along.  
22I am sending him to you for just this purpose. He will let you know how we are, and he will encourage you.
23May God give you peace, dear brothers and sisters,[e] and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  
24May God's grace be upon all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.
