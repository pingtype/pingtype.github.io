1Then this message came to me from the LORD:  2"Son of man, how does a grapevine compare to a tree? Is a vine's wood as useful as the wood of a tree?  3Can its wood be used for making things, like pegs to hang up pots and pans?  4No, it can only be used for fuel, and even as fuel, it burns too quickly.  5Vine branches are useless both before and after being put into the fire!6"And this is what the Sovereign LORD says: The people of Jerusalem are like grapevines growing among the trees of the forest. Since they are useless, I have set them aside to be burned!  7And I will see to it that if they escape from one fire, they will fall into another. When this happens, you will know that I am the LORD. 8And I will make the land desolate because my people have been unfaithful to me, says the Sovereign LORD."
