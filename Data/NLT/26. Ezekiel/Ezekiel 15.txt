[Jerusalem-a Useless Vine] 1 Then this message came to me from the Lord : 2 "Son of man, how does a grapevine compare to a tree? Is a vine's wood as useful as the wood of a tree? 3 Can its wood be used for making things, like pegs to hang up pots and pans? 4 No, it can only be used for fuel, and even as fuel, it burns too quickly. 5 Vines are useless both before and after being put into the fire!6 "And this is what the Sovereign Lord  says: The people of Jerusalem are like grapevines growing among the trees of the forest. Since they are useless, I have thrown them on the fire to be burned. 7 And I will see to it that if they escape from one fire, they will fall into another. When I turn against them, you will know that I am the Lord . 8 And I will make the land desolate because my people have been unfaithful to me. I, the Sovereign Lord , have spoken!"       Footnotes:
