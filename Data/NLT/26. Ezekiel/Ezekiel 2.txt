1"Stand up, son of man," said the voice. "I want to speak with you."  2The Spirit came into me as he spoke and set me on my feet. I listened carefully to his words.  3"Son of man," he said, "I am sending you to the nation of Israel, a nation that is rebelling against me. Their ancestors have rebelled against me from the beginning, and they are still in revolt to this very day.  4They are a hard-hearted and stubborn people. But I am sending you to say to them, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says!'  5And whether they listen or not--for remember, they are rebels--at least they will know they have had a prophet among them.6"Son of man, do not fear them. Don't be afraid even though their threats are sharp as thorns and barbed like briers, and they sting like scorpions. Do not be dismayed by their dark scowls. For remember, they are rebels!  7You must give them my messages whether they listen or not. But they won't listen, for they are completely rebellious!  8Son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not join them in being a rebel. Open your mouth, and eat what I give you."9Then I looked and saw a hand reaching out to me, and it held a scroll.  10He unrolled it, and I saw that both sides were covered with funeral songs, other words of sorrow, and pronouncements of doom.
