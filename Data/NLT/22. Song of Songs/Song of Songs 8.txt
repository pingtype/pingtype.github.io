1 Young Woman: Oh, if only you were my brother, who nursed at my mothers breast. Then I could kiss you no matter who was watching, and no one would criticize me.  2I would bring you to my childhood home, and there you would teach me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, my sweet pomegranate wine.  3Your left hand would be under my head and your right hand would embrace me.4"I want you to promise, O women of Jerusalem, not to awaken love until the time is right.[a]"5 Young Women of Jerusalem: Who is this coming up from the desert, leaning on her lover? Young Woman: I aroused you under the apple tree, where your mother gave you birth, where in great pain she delivered you.  6Place me like a seal over your heart, or like a seal on your arm. For love is as strong as death, and its jealousy is as enduring as the grave. Love flashes like fire, the brightest kind of flame.  7Many waters cannot quench love; neither can rivers drown it. If a man tried to buy love with everything he owned, his offer would be utterly despised.8 The Young Woman’s Brothers: We have a little sister too young for breasts. What will we do if someone asks to marry her?  9If she is chaste, we will strengthen and encourage her. But if she is promiscuous, we will shut her off from men.[b]10 Young Woman: I am chaste, and I am now full breasted. And my lover is content with me.11"Solomon has a vineyard at Baal-hamon, which he rents to some farmers there. Each of them pays one thousand pieces of silver[c] for its use.  12But as for my own vineyard, O Solomon, you can take my thousand pieces of silver. And I will give two hundred pieces of silver[d] to those who care for its vines."13 Young Man: O my beloved, lingering in the gardens, how wonderful that your companions can listen to your voice. Let me hear it, too!14 Young Woman: Come quickly, my love! Move like a swift gazelle or a young deer on the mountains of spices.
