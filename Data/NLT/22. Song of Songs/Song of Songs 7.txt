1[a]How beautiful are your sandaled feet, O queenly maiden. Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of a skilled craftsman.2 Your navel is perfectly formed like a goblet filled with mixed wine. Between your thighs lies a mound of wheat bordered with lilies.3 Your breasts are like two fawns, twin fawns of a gazelle.4 Your neck is as beautiful as an ivory tower. Your eyes are like the sparkling pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Your nose is as fine as the tower of Lebanon overlooking Damascus.5 Your head is as majestic as Mount Carmel, and the sheen of your hair radiates royalty. The king is held captive by its tresses.6 Oh, how beautiful you are! How pleasing, my love, how full of delights!7 You are slender like a palm tree, and your breasts are like its clusters of fruit.8 I said, "I will climb the palm tree and take hold of its fruit." May your breasts be like grape clusters, and the fragrance of your breath like apples.9 May your kisses be as exciting as the best wine- [Young Woman] Yes, wine that goes down smoothly for my lover, flowing gently over lips and teeth.[b]10 I am my lover's, and he claims me as his own.11 Come, my love, let us go out to the fields and spend the night among the wildflowers.[c]12 Let us get up early and go to the vineyards to see if the grapevines have budded, if the blossoms have opened, and if the pomegranates have bloomed. There I will give you my love.13 There the mandrakes give off their fragrance, and the finest fruits are at our door, new delights as well as old, which I have saved for you, my lover.       Footnotes:a.   7:1 Verses 7:1-13 are numbered 7:2-14 in Hebrew text.  b.   7:9 As in Greek and Syriac versions and Latin Vulgate; Hebrew reads over lips of sleepers. c.   7:11 Or in the villages.
