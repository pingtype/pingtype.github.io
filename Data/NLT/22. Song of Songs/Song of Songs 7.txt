1 Young Man: How beautiful are your sandaled feet, O queenly maiden. Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of a skilled craftsman.  2Your navel is as delicious as a goblet filled with wine. Your belly is lovely, like a heap of wheat set about with lilies.  3Your breasts are like twin fawns of a gazelle.  4Your neck is as stately as an ivory tower. Your eyes are like the sparkling pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Your nose is as fine as the tower of Lebanon overlooking Damascus.  5Your head is as majestic as Mount Carmel, and the sheen of your hair radiates royalty. A king is held captive in your queenly tresses.6"Oh, how delightful you are, my beloved; how pleasant for utter delight!  7You are tall and slim like a palm tree, and your breasts are like its clusters of dates.  8I said, `I will climb up into the palm tree and take hold of its branches.' Now may your breasts be like grape clusters, and the scent of your breath like apples. 9May your kisses be as exciting as the best wine, smooth and sweet, flowing gently over lips and teeth.[a]"10 Young Woman: I am my lovers, the one he desires.  11Come, my love, let us go out into the fields and spend the night among the wildflowers.[b]  12Let us get up early and go out to the vineyards. Let us see whether the vines have budded, whether the blossoms have opened, and whether the pomegranates are in flower. And there I will give you my love.  12There the mandrakes give forth their fragrance, and the rarest fruits are at our doors, the new as well as old, for I have stored them up for you, my lover.
