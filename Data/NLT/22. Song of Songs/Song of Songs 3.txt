[Young Woman] 1 One night as I lay in bed, I yearned for my lover. I yearned for him, but he did not come.2 So I said to myself, "I will get up and roam the city, searching in all its streets and squares. I will search for the one I love." So I searched everywhere but did not find him.3 The watchmen stopped me as they made their rounds, and I asked, "Have you seen the one I love?"4 Then scarcely had I left them when I found my love! I caught and held him tightly, then I brought him to my mother's house, into my mother's bed, where I had been conceived.5 Promise me, O women of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and wild deer, not to awaken love until the time is right.*Who is this sweeping in from the wilderness like a cloud of smoke? Who is it, fragrant with myrrh and frankincense and every kind of spice?7 Look, it is Solomon's carriage, surrounded by sixty heroic men, the best of Israel's soldiers.8 They are all skilled swordsmen, experienced warriors. Each wears a sword on his thigh, ready to defend the king against an attack in the night.9 King Solomon's carriage is built of wood imported from Lebanon.10 Its posts are silver, its canopy gold; its cushions are purple. It was decorated with love by the young women of Jerusalem. [Young Woman] 11 Come out to see King Solomon, young women of Jerusalem.*He wears the crown his mother gave him on his wedding day, his most joyous day.       Footnotes: 3:5 Or not to awaken love until it is ready.  [Young Women of Jerusalem] 6  3:11 Hebrew of Zion.
