1 This message concerning Nineveh came as a vision to Nahum, who lived in Elkosh.2The LORD is a jealous God, filled with vengeance and wrath. He takes revenge on all who oppose him and furiously destroys his enemies!  3The LORD is slow to get angry, but his power is great, and he never lets the guilty go unpunished. He displays his power in the whirlwind and the storm. The billowing clouds are the dust beneath his feet.  4At his command the oceans and rivers dry up, the lush pastures of Bashan and Carmel fade, and the green forests of Lebanon wilt.  5In his presence the mountains quake, and the hills melt away; the earth trembles, and its people are destroyed.  6Who can stand before his fierce anger? Who can survive his burning fury? His rage blazes forth like fire, and the mountains crumble to dust in his presence.7The LORD is good. When trouble comes, he is a strong refuge. And he knows everyone who trusts in him. 8But he sweeps away his enemies in an overwhelming flood. He pursues his foes into the darkness of night.9Why are you scheming against the LORD? He will destroy you with one blow; he won't need to strike twice!  10His enemies, tangled up like thorns, staggering like drunks, will be burned like dry straw in a field. 11Who is this king of yours who dares to plot evil against the LORD?12This is what the LORD says: "Even though the Assyrians have many allies, they will be destroyed and disappear. O my people, I have already punished you once, and I will not do it again.  13Now I will break your chains and release you from Assyrian oppression."14And this is what the LORD says concerning the Assyrians in Nineveh: "You will have no more children to carry on your name. I will destroy all the idols in the temples of your gods. I am preparing a grave for you because you are despicable and don't deserve to live!"15Look! A messenger is coming over the mountains with good news! He is bringing a message of peace. Celebrate your festivals, O people of Judah, and fulfill all your vows, for your enemies from Nineveh will never invade your land again. They have been completely destroyed!
