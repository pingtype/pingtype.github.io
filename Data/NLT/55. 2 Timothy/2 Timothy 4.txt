1 And so I solemnly urge you before God and before Christ Jesus--who will someday judge the living and the dead when he appears to set up his Kingdom:  2Preach the word of God. Be persistent, whether the time is favorable or not. Patiently correct, rebuke, and encourage your people with good teaching.3For a time is coming when people will no longer listen to right teaching. They will follow their own desires and will look for teachers who will tell them whatever they want to hear.  4They will reject the truth and follow strange myths.5But you should keep a clear mind in every situation. Don't be afraid of suffering for the Lord. Work at bringing others to Christ. Complete the ministry God has given you.6As for me, my life has already been poured out as an offering to God. The time of my death is near.  7I have fought a good fight, I have finished the race, and I have remained faithful.  8And now the prize awaits me--the crown of righteousness that the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give me on that great day of his return. And the prize is not just for me but for all who eagerly look forward to his glorious return.9Please come as soon as you can.  10Demas has deserted me because he loves the things of this life and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus has gone to Dalmatia.  11Only Luke is with me. Bring Mark with you when you come, for he will be helpful to me.  12I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.  13When you come, be sure to bring the coat I left with Carpus at Troas. Also bring my books, and especially my papers.[a]14Alexander the coppersmith has done me much harm, but the Lord will judge him for what he has done. 15Be careful of him, for he fought against everything we said.16The first time I was brought before the judge, no one was with me. Everyone had abandoned me. I hope it will not be counted against them.  17But the Lord stood with me and gave me strength, that I might preach the Good News in all its fullness for all the Gentiles to hear. And he saved me from certain death.[b] 18Yes, and the Lord will deliver me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly Kingdom. To God be the glory forever and ever. Amen.19Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila and those living at the household of Onesiphorus.  20Erastus stayed at Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick at Miletus.21Hurry so you can get here before winter. Eubulus sends you greetings, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers and sisters.[c]22May the Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you all.
