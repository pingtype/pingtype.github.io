1You should also know this, Timothy, that in the last days there will be very difficult times.  2For people will love only themselves and their money. They will be boastful and proud, scoffing at God, disobedient to their parents, and ungrateful. They will consider nothing sacred.  3They will be unloving and unforgiving; they will slander others and have no self-control; they will be cruel and have no interest in what is good.  4They will betray their friends, be reckless, be puffed up with pride, and love pleasure rather than God.  5They will act as if they are religious, but they will reject the power that could make them godly. You must stay away from people like that.6They are the kind who work their way into people's homes and win the confidence of[a] vulnerable women who are burdened with the guilt of sin and controlled by many desires.  7Such women are forever following new teachings, but they never understand the truth.  8And these teachers fight the truth just as Jannes and Jambres fought against Moses. Their minds are depraved, and their faith is counterfeit.  9But they won't get away with this for long. Someday everyone will recognize what fools they are, just as happened with Jannes and Jambres.10But you know what I teach, Timothy, and how I live, and what my purpose in life is. You know my faith and how long I have suffered. You know my love and my patient endurance.  11You know how much persecution and suffering I have endured. You know all about how I was persecuted in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra--but the Lord delivered me from all of it.  12Yes, and everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.  13But evil people and impostors will flourish. They will go on deceiving others, and they themselves will be deceived.14But you must remain faithful to the things you have been taught. You know they are true, for you know you can trust those who taught you.  15You have been taught the holy Scriptures from childhood, and they have given you the wisdom to receive the salvation that comes by trusting in Christ Jesus.  16All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives. It straightens us out and teaches us to do what is right.  17It is God's way of preparing us in every way, fully equipped for every good thing God wants us to do.
