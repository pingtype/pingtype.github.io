1 The LORD gave these messages to Micah of Moresheth during the years when Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah. The messages concerned both Samaria and Jerusalem, and they came to Micah in the form of visions.2Attention! Let all the people of the world listen! The Sovereign LORD has made accusations against you; the Lord speaks from his holy Temple.3Look! The LORD is coming! He leaves his throne in heaven and comes to earth, walking on the high places.  4They melt beneath his feet and flow into the valleys like wax in a fire, like water pouring down a hill.5And why is this happening? Because of the sins and rebellion of Israel and Judah.[a] Who is to blame for Israel's rebellion? Samaria, its capital city! Where is the center of idolatry in Judah? In Jerusalem, its capital!6"So I, the LORD, will make the city of Samaria a heap of rubble. Her streets will be plowed up for planting vineyards. I will roll the stones of her walls down into the valley below, exposing all her foundations. 7All her carved images will be smashed to pieces. All her sacred treasures will be burned up. These things were bought with the money earned by her prostitution, and they will now be carried away to pay prostitutes elsewhere."8Because of all this, I will mourn and lament. I will walk around naked and barefoot in sorrow and shame. I will howl like a jackal and wail like an ostrich.  9For my people's wound is far too deep to heal. It has reached into Judah, even to the gates of Jerusalem.10Don't tell our enemies in the city of Gath[b]; don't weep at all.[c] You people in Beth-leaphrah,[d] roll in the dust to show your anguish and despair.  11You people of Shaphir,[e] go as captives into exile--naked and ashamed. The people of Zaanan[f] dare not come outside their walls. The people of Beth-ezel[g] mourn because the very foundations of their city have been swept away.  12The people of Maroth[h] anxiously wait for relief, but only bitterness awaits them as the LORD's judgment reaches even to the gates of Jerusalem.13Quick! Use your swiftest chariots and flee, you people of Lachish.[i] You were the first city in Judah to follow Israel in the sin of idol worship, and so you led Jerusalem[j] into sin.  14Send a farewell gift to Moresheth-gath; there is no hope of saving it. The town of Aczib[k] has deceived the kings of Israel, for it promised help it could not give.  15You people of Mareshah,[l] I will bring a conqueror to capture your town. And the leaders[m] of Israel will go to Adullam.16Weep, you people of Judah! Shave your heads in sorrow, for the children you love will be snatched away, and you will never see them again. Make yourselves as bald as an eagle, for your little ones will be exiled to distant lands.
