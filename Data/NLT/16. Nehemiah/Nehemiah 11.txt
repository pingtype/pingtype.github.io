1Now the leaders of the people were living in Jerusalem, the holy city, at this time. A tenth of the people from the other towns of Judah and Benjamin were chosen by sacred lots to live there, too, while the rest stayed where they were.  2And the people commended everyone who volunteered to resettle in Jerusalem.3Here is a list of the names of the provincial officials who came to Jerusalem. Most of the people, priests, Levites, Temple servants, and descendants of Solomon's servants continued to live in their own homes in the various towns of Judah,  4but some of the people from Judah and Benjamin resettled in Jerusalem. From the tribe of Judah: Athaiah son of Uzziah, son of Zechariah, son of Amariah, son of Shephatiah, son of Mahalalel, of the family of Perez;  5and Maaseiah son of Baruch, son of Col-hozeh, son of Hazaiah, son of Adaiah, son of Joiarib, son of Zechariah, of the family of Shelah.[a]  6There were also 468 descendants of Perez who lived in Jerusalem--all outstanding men.7From the tribe of Benjamin: Sallu son of Meshullam, son of Joed, son of Pedaiah, son of Kolaiah, son of Maaseiah, son of Ithiel, son of Jeshaiah;  8and after him there were Gabbai and Sallai, and a total of 928 relatives.  9Their chief officer was Joel son of Zicri, who was assisted by Judah son of Hassenuah, second-in-command over the city.10From the priests: Jedaiah son of Joiarib; Jakin;  11and Seraiah son of Hilkiah, son of Meshullam, son of Zadok, son of Meraioth, son of Ahitub, the supervisor of the Temple of God;  12together with 822 of their associates, who worked at the Temple. Also, there was Adaiah son of Jeroham, son of Pelaliah, son of Amzi, son of Zechariah, son of Pashhur, son of Malkijah;  13and 242 of his associates, who were heads of their families. There were also Amashsai son of Azarel, son of Ahzai, son of Meshillemoth, son of Immer;  14and 128 of his outstanding associates. Their chief officer was Zabdiel son of Haggedolim.15From the Levites: Shemaiah son of Hasshub, son of Azrikam, son of Hashabiah, son of Bunni; 16Shabbethai and Jozabad, who were in charge of the work outside the Temple of God;  17Mattaniah son of Mica, son of Zabdi, a descendant of Asaph, who opened the thanksgiving services with prayer; Bakbukiah, who was Mattaniah's assistant; and Abda son of Shammua, son of Galal, son of Jeduthun.  18In all, there were 284 Levites in the holy city.19From the gatekeepers: Akkub, Talmon, and 172 of their associates, who guarded the gates.20The other priests, Levites, and the rest of the Israelites lived wherever their family inheritance was located in any of the towns of Judah.  21However, the Temple servants, whose leaders were Ziha and Gishpa, all lived on the hill of Ophel.22The chief officer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani, son of Hashabiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Mica, a descendant of Asaph, whose family served as singers at God's Temple.  23They were under royal orders, which determined their daily activities.24Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, a descendant of Zerah son of Judah, was the king's agent in all matters of public administration.25Some of the people of Judah lived in Kiriath-arba with its villages, Dibon with its villages, and Jekabzeel with its villages.  26They also lived in Jeshua, Moladah, Beth-pelet,  27Hazar-shual, Beersheba with its villages, 28Ziklag, and Meconah with its villages.  29They were also in En-rimmon, Zorah, Jarmuth,  30Zanoah, and Adullam with their villages. They were also in Lachish and its nearby fields and Azekah with its surrounding villages. So the people of Judah were living all the way from Beersheba to the valley of Hinnom.31Some of the people of Benjamin lived at Geba, Micmash, Aija, and Bethel with its surrounding villages. 32They were also in Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,  33Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,  34Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,  35Lod, Ono, and the Valley of Craftsmen.[b]  36Some of the Levites who lived in Judah were sent to live with the tribe of Benjamin.
