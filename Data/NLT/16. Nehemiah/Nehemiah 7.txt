1 After the wall was finished and I had set up the doors in the gates, the gatekeepers, singers, and Levites were appointed. 2 I gave the responsibility of governing Jerusalem to my brother Hanani, along with Hananiah, the commander of the fortress, for he was a faithful man who feared God more than most. 3 I said to them, "Do not leave the gates open during the hottest part of the day.[a] And even while the gatekeepers are on duty, have them shut and bar the doors. Appoint the residents of Jerusalem to act as guards, everyone on a regular watch. Some will serve at sentry posts and some in front of their own homes." [Nehemiah Registers the People] 4 At that time the city was large and spacious, but the population was small, and none of the houses had been rebuilt. 5 So my God gave me the idea to call together all the nobles and leaders of the city, along with the ordinary citizens, for registration. I had found the genealogical record of those who had first returned to Judah. This is what was written there:6 Here is the list of the Jewish exiles of the provinces who returned from their captivity. King Nebuchadnezzar had deported them to Babylon, but now they returned to Jerusalem and the other towns in Judah where they originally lived. 7 Their leaders were Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah,[b] Reelaiah,[c] Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar,[d] Bigvai, Rehum,[e] and Baanah. This is the number of the men of Israel who returned from exile:               8 The family of Parosh         2,172               9 The family of Shephatiah         372               10 The family of Arah         652               11 The family of Pahath-moab (descendants of Jeshua and Joab)         2,818               12 The family of Elam         1,254               13 The family of Zattu         845               14 The family of Zaccai         760               15 The family of Bani[f]648               16 The family of Bebai         628               17 The family of Azgad         2,322               18 The family of Adonikam         667               19 The family of Bigvai         2,067               20 The family of Adin         655               21 The family of Ater (descendants of Hezekiah)         98               22 The family of Hashum         328               23 The family of Bezai         324               24 The family of Jorah[g]112               25 The family of Gibbar[h]95               26 The people of Bethlehem and Netophah         188               27 The people of Anathoth         128               28 The people of Beth-azmaveth         42               29 The people of Kiriath-jearim, Kephirah, and Beeroth         743               30 The people of Ramah and Geba         621               31 The people of Micmash         122               32 The people of Bethel and Ai         123               33 The people of West Nebo[i]52               34 The citizens of West Elam[j]1,254               35 The citizens of Harim         320               36 The citizens of Jericho         345               37 The citizens of Lod, Hadid, and Ono         721               38 The citizens of Senaah         3,93039 These are the priests who returned from exile:               The family of Jedaiah (through the line of Jeshua)         973               40 The family of Immer         1,052               41 The family of Pashhur         1,247               42 The family of Harim         1,01743 These are the Levites who returned from exile:               The families of Jeshua and Kadmiel (descendants of Hodaviah[k])         74               44 The singers of the family of Asaph         148               45 The gatekeepers of the families of Shallum, Ater, Talmon, Akkub, Hatita, and Shobai         13846 The descendants of the following Temple servants returned from exile: Ziha, Hasupha, Tabbaoth,47 Keros, Siaha,[l] Padon,48 Lebanah, Hagabah, Shalmai,49 Hanan, Giddel, Gahar,50 Reaiah, Rezin, Nekoda,51 Gazzam, Uzza, Paseah,52 Besai, Meunim, Nephusim,[m]53 Bakbuk, Hakupha, Harhur,54 Bazluth,[n] Mehida, Harsha,55 Barkos, Sisera, Temah,56 Neziah, and Hatipha.57 The descendants of these servants of King Solomon returned from exile: Sotai, Hassophereth, Peruda,[o]58 Jaalah,[p] Darkon, Giddel,59 Shephatiah, Hattil, Pokereth-hazzebaim, and Ami.[q]60 In all, the Temple servants and the descendants of Solomon's servants numbered 392.61 Another group returned at this time from the towns of Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Kerub, Addan,[r] and Immer. However, they could not prove that they or their families were descendants of Israel. 62 This group included the families of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda-a total of 642 people.63 Three families of priests-Hobaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai-also returned. (This Barzillai had married a woman who was a descendant of Barzillai of Gilead, and he had taken her family name.) 64 They searched for their names in the genealogical records, but they were not found, so they were disqualified from serving as priests. 65 The governor told them not to eat the priests' share of food from the sacrifices until a priest could consult the Lord  about the matter by using the Urim and Thummim-the sacred lots.66 So a total of 42,360 people returned to Judah, 67 in addition to 7,337 servants and 245 singers, both men and women. 68 They took with them 736 horses, 245 mules,[s] 69 435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.70 Some of the family leaders gave gifts for the work. The governor gave to the treasury 1,000 gold coins,[t] 50 gold basins, and 530 robes for the priests. 71 The other leaders gave to the treasury a total of 20,000 gold coins[u] and some 2,750 pounds[v] of silver for the work. 72 The rest of the people gave 20,000 gold coins, about 2,500 pounds[w] of silver, and 67 robes for the priests.73 So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the Temple servants, and some of the common people settled near Jerusalem. The rest of the people returned to their own towns throughout Israel.       Footnotes:a.   7:3 Or Keep the gates of Jerusalem closed until the sun is hot.  b.   7:7a As in parallel text at Ezra 2:2; Hebrew reads Azariah.  c.   7:7b As in parallel text at Ezra 2:2; Hebrew reads Raamiah.  d.   7:7c As in parallel text at Ezra 2:2; Hebrew reads Mispereth.  e.   7:7d As in parallel text at Ezra 2:2; Hebrew reads Nehum.  f.   7:15 As in parallel text at Ezra 2:10; Hebrew reads Binnui.          g.   7:24 As in parallel text at Ezra 2:18; Hebrew reads Hariph.          h.   7:25 As in parallel text at Ezra 2:20; Hebrew reads Gibeon.          i.   7:33 Or of the other Nebo.          j.   7:34 Or of the other Elam.          k.   7:43 As in parallel text at Ezra 2:40; Hebrew reads Hodevah.  l.   7:47 As in parallel text at Ezra 2:44; Hebrew reads Sia.  m.   7:52 As in parallel text at Ezra 2:50; Hebrew reads Nephushesim. n.   7:54 As in parallel text at Ezra 2:52; Hebrew reads Bazlith.  o.   7:57 As in parallel text at Ezra 2:55; Hebrew reads Sotai, Sophereth, Perida. p.   7:58 As in parallel text at Ezra 2:56; Hebrew reads Jaala.  q.   7:59 As in parallel text at Ezra 2:57; Hebrew reads Amon. r.   7:61 As in parallel text at Ezra 2:59; Hebrew reads Addon.  s.   7:68 As in some Hebrew manuscripts (see also Ezra 2:66); most Hebrew manuscripts lack this verse.
