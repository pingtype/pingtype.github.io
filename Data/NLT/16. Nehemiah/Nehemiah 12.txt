1Here is the list of the priests and Levites who had returned with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the high priest: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,2 Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,3 Shecaniah, Harim,[a] Meremoth,4 Iddo, Ginnethon,[b] Abijah,5 Miniamin, Moadiah,[c] Bilgah,6 Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah,7 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These were the leaders of the priests and their associates in the days of Jeshua.8The Levites who had returned with them were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who with his associates was in charge of the songs of thanksgiving.  9Their associates, Bakbukiah and Unni, stood opposite them during the service.10 Jeshua the high priest was the father of Joiakim. Joiakim was the father of Eliashib. Eliashib was the father of Joiada.11 Joiada was the father of Johanan.[d] Johanan was the father of Jaddua.12Now when Joiakim was high priest, the family leaders of the priests were as follows: Meraiah was leader of the family of Seraiah. Hananiah was leader of the family of Jeremiah.13 Meshullam was leader of the family of Ezra. Jehohanan was leader of the family of Amariah.14 Jonathan was leader of the family of Malluch.[e] Joseph was leader of the family of Shecaniah.[f]15 Adna was leader of the family of Harim. Helkai was leader of the family of Meremoth.[g]16 Zechariah was leader of the family of Iddo. Meshullam was leader of the family of Ginnethon.17 Zicri was leader of the family of Abijah. There was also a[h] leader of the family of Miniamin. Piltai was leader of the family of Moadiah.18 Shammua was leader of the family of Bilgah. Jehonathan was leader of the family of Shemaiah.19 Mattenai was leader of the family of Joiarib. Uzzi was leader of the family of Jedaiah.20 Kallai was leader of the family of Sallu.[i] Eber was leader of the family of Amok.21 Hashabiah was leader of the family of Hilkiah. Nethanel was leader of the family of Jedaiah.22During the reign of Darius II of Persia,[j] a list was compiled of the family leaders of the Levites and the priests in the days of the following high priests: Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua.  23The heads of the Levite families were recorded in The Book of History down to the days of Johanan, the grandson[k] of Eliashib.24These were the family leaders of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua, Binnui,[l] Kadmiel, and other associates, who stood opposite them during the ceremonies of praise and thanksgiving, one section responding to the other, just as commanded by David, the man of God.  25This included Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, and Obadiah. Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were the gatekeepers in charge of the storerooms at the gates.  26These all served in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, son of Jehozadak,[m] and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest and scribe.27During the dedication of the new wall of Jerusalem, the Levites throughout the land were asked to come to Jerusalem to assist in the ceremonies. They were to take part in the joyous occasion with their songs of thanksgiving and with the music of cymbals, lyres, and harps.  28The singers were brought together from Jerusalem and its surrounding villages and from the villages of the Netophathites.  29They also came from Beth-gilgal and the area of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built their own villages around Jerusalem.  30The priests and Levites first dedicated themselves, then the people, the gates, and the wall.31I led the leaders of Judah to the top of the wall and organized two large choirs to give thanks. One of the choirs proceeded southward[n] along the top of the wall to the Dung Gate.  32Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed them,  33along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,  34Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,  35and some priests who played trumpets. Then came Zechariah son of Jonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Micaiah, son of Zaccur, a descendant of Asaph.  36And finally came Zechariah's colleagues Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani. They used the musical instruments prescribed by David, the man of God. Ezra the scribe led this procession.  37At the Fountain Gate they went straight up the steps on the ascent of the city wall toward the City of David. They passed the house of David and then proceeded to the Water Gate on the east.38The second choir went northward[o] around the other way to meet them. I followed them, with the other half of the people, along the top of the wall past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall,  39then past the Ephraim Gate to the Old City Gate,[p] past the Fish Gate and the Tower of Hananel, and went on to the Tower of the Hundred. Then we continued on to the Sheep Gate and stopped at the Guard Gate.40The two choirs that were giving thanks then proceeded to the Temple of God, where they took their places. So did I, together with the group of leaders who were with me.  41We went together with the trumpet-playing priests--Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah--  42and the singers--Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam, and Ezer. They played and sang loudly and clearly under the direction of Jezrahiah the choir director.43Many sacrifices were offered on that joyous day, for God had given the people cause for great joy. The women and children also participated in the celebration, and the joy of the people of Jerusalem could be heard far away.44On that day men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for the gifts, the first part of the harvest, and the tithes. They were responsible to collect these from the fields as required by the law for the priests and Levites, for all the people of Judah valued the priests and Levites and their work.  45They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, as required by the laws of David and his son Solomon, and so did the singers and the gatekeepers.  46The custom of having choir directors to lead the choirs in hymns of praise and thanks to God began long ago in the days of David and Asaph.  47So now, in the days of Zerubbabel and of Nehemiah, the people brought a daily supply of food for the singers, the gatekeepers, and the Levites. The Levites, in turn, gave a portion of what they received to the priests, the descendants of Aaron.
