1The one who existed from the beginning[a] is the one we have heard and seen. We saw him with our own eyes and touched him with our own hands. He is Jesus Christ, the Word of life.  2This one who is life from God was shown to us, and we have seen him. And now we testify and announce to you that he is the one who is eternal life. He was with the Father, and then he was shown to us.  3We are telling you about what we ourselves have actually seen and heard, so that you may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.4We are writing these things so that our[b] joy will be complete.5This is the message he has given us to announce to you: God is light and there is no darkness in him at all. 6So we are lying if we say we have fellowship with God but go on living in spiritual darkness. We are not living in the truth.  7But if we are living in the light of God's presence, just as Christ is, then we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from every sin.8If we say we have no sin, we are only fooling ourselves and refusing to accept the truth.  9But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from every wrong.  10If we claim we have not sinned, we are calling God a liar and showing that his word has no place in our hearts.
