1 Some of the descendants of Judah were Perez, Hezron, Carmi, Hur, and Shobal.2Shobal's son Reaiah was the father of Jahath. Jahath was the father of Ahumai and Lahad. These were the families of the Zorathites.3The descendants of[a] Etam were Jezreel, Ishma, Idbash, Hazzelelponi (his daughter),  4Penuel (the father of[b] Gedor), and Ezer (the father of Hushah). These were the descendants of Hur (the firstborn of Ephrathah), the ancestor of Bethlehem.5Ashhur (the father of Tekoa) had two wives, named Helah and Naarah.  6Naarah gave birth to Ahuzzam, Hepher, Temeni, and Haahashtari.  7Helah gave birth to Zereth, Izhar, Ethnan,  8and Koz, who became the ancestor of Anub, Zobebah, and all the families of Aharhel son of Harum.9There was a man named Jabez who was more distinguished than any of his brothers. His mother named him Jabez[c] because his birth had been so painful.  10He was the one who prayed to the God of Israel, "Oh, that you would bless me and extend my lands! Please be with me in all that I do, and keep me from all trouble and pain!" And God granted him his request.11Kelub (the brother of Shuhah) was the father of Mehir. Mehir was the father of Eshton.  12Eshton was the father of Beth-rapha, Paseah, and Tehinnah. Tehinnah was the father of Ir-nahash. These were the descendants of Recah.13The sons of Kenaz were Othniel and Seraiah. Othniel's sons were Hathath and Meonothai.[d] 14Meonothai was the father of Ophrah. Seraiah was the father of Joab, the founder of the Valley of Craftsmen,[e] so called because many craftsmen lived there.15The sons of Caleb son of Jephunneh were Iru, Elah, and Naam. The son of Elah was Kenaz.16The sons of Jehallelel were Ziph, Ziphah, Tiria, and Asarel.17The sons of Ezrah were Jether, Mered, Epher, and Jalon. Mered married an Egyptian woman, who became the mother of Miriam, Shammai, and Ishbah (the father of Eshtemoa).  18Mered also married a woman of Judah, who became the mother of Jered (the father of Gedor), Heber (the father of Soco), and Jekuthiel (the father of Zanoah). Mered's Egyptian wife was named Bithiah, and she was an Egyptian princess.19Hodiah's wife was the sister of Naham. One of her sons was the father of Keilah the Garmite, and another was the father of Eshtemoa the Maacathite.20The sons of Shimon were Amnon, Rinnah, Ben-hanan, and Tilon. The descendants of Ishi were Zoheth and Ben-zoheth.21Shelah was one of Judah's sons. The descendants of Shelah were Er (the father of Lecah), Laadah (the father of Mareshah), the families of linen workers at Beth-ashbea,  22Jokim, the people of Cozeba, Joash, and Saraph, who ruled over Moab and Jashubi-lehem. These names all come from ancient records.  23They were the potters who lived in Netaim and Gederah. They all worked for the king.24The sons of Simeon were Nemuel, Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, and Shaul.25The descendants of Shaul were Shallum, Mibsam, and Mishma.26The descendants of Mishma were Hammuel, Zaccur, and Shimei.27Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters, but none of his brothers had large families. So Simeon's tribe never became as large as the tribe of Judah.28They lived in Beersheba, Moladah, Hazar-shual,  29Bilhah, Ezem, Tolad,  30Bethuel, Hormah, Ziklag, 31Beth-marcaboth, Hazar-susim, Beth-biri, and Shaaraim. These towns were under their control until the time of King David.32Their descendants also lived in Etam, Ain, Rimmon, Token, and Ashan--five towns  33and their surrounding villages as far away as Baalath.[f] This was their territory, and these names are recorded in their family genealogy.34Other descendants of Simeon included Meshobab, Jamlech, Joshah son of Amaziah,  35Joel, Jehu son of Joshibiah, son of Seraiah, son of Asiel,  36Elioenai, Jaakobah, Jeshohaiah, Asaiah, Adiel, Jesimiel, Benaiah, 37and Ziza son of Shiphi, son of Allon, son of Jedaiah, son of Shimri, son of Shemaiah.38These were the names of some of the leaders of Simeon's wealthy clans,  39who traveled to the region of Gedor, in the east part of the valley, seeking pastureland for their flocks.  40They found lush pastures there, and the land was quiet and peaceful. Some of Ham's descendants had been living in the region of Gedor.  41But during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah, the leaders of Simeon invaded it and completely destroyed[g] the homes of the descendants of Ham and of the Meunites. They killed everyone who lived there and took the land for themselves, because they wanted its good pastureland for their flocks.  42Five hundred of these invaders from the tribe of Simeon went to Mount Seir, led by Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel--all sons of Ishi. 43They destroyed the few Amalekites who had survived, and they have lived there ever since.
