1 The sons of Israel[a] were Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun,  2Dan, Joseph, Benjamin, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.3Judah had three sons through Bathshua, a Canaanite woman. Their names were Er, Onan, and Shelah. But the oldest son, Er, was a wicked man, so the LORD killed him.  4Later Judah had twin sons through Tamar, his widowed daughter-in-law. Their names were Perez and Zerah. So Judah had five sons in all.5The sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.6The sons of Zerah were Zimri, Ethan, Heman, Calcol, and Darda[b]--five in all.7Achan[c] son of Carmi, one of Zerah's descendants, brought disaster on Israel by taking plunder that had been set apart for the LORD.[d]8The son of Ethan was Azariah.9The sons of Hezron were Jerahmeel, Ram, and Caleb.[e]10 Ram was the father of Amminadab.
