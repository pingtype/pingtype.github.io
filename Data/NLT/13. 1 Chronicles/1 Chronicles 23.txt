1When David was an old man, he appointed his son Solomon to be king over Israel.  2David summoned all the political leaders of Israel, together with the priests and Levites, for the coronation ceremony.  3All the Levites who were thirty years old or older were counted, and the total came to thirty-eight thousand.  4Then David said, "Twenty-four thousand of them will supervise the work at the Temple of the LORD. Six thousand are to serve as officials and judges.  5Four thousand will work as gatekeepers, and another four thousand will praise the LORD with the musical instruments I have made."  6Then David divided the Levites into divisions named after the clans descended from the three sons of Levi--Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.7The Gershonite family units were defined by their lines of descent from Libni[a] and Shimei, the sons of Gershon.  8Three of the descendants of Libni were Jehiel (the family leader), Zetham, and Joel.  9These were the leaders of the family of Libni. Three of the descendants of Shimei were Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran.  10Four other descendants of Shimei were Jahath, Ziza,[b] Jeush, and Beriah.  11Jahath was the family leader, and Ziza was next. Jeush and Beriah were counted as a single family because neither had many sons.12The descendants of Kohath included Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.13The sons of Amram were Aaron and Moses. Aaron and his descendants were set apart to dedicate the most holy things, to offer sacrifices in the LORD's presence, to serve the LORD, and to pronounce blessings in his name forever.14As for Moses, the man of God, his sons were included with the tribe of Levi.  15The sons of Moses were Gershom and Eliezer.16 The descendants of Gershom included Shebuel, the family leader.17 Eliezer had only one son, Rehabiah, the family leader. Rehabiah had numerous descendants.18The descendants of Izhar included Shelomith, the family leader.19The descendants of Hebron included Jeriah (the family leader), Amariah (the second), Jahaziel (the third), and Jekameam (the fourth).20The descendants of Uzziel included Micah (the family leader) and Isshiah (the second).21The descendants of Merari included Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli were Eleazar and Kish.  22Eleazar died with no sons, only daughters. His daughters married their cousins, the sons of Kish.23The three sons of Mushi were Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth.24These were the descendants of Levi by clans, the leaders of their family groups, registered carefully by name. Each had to be twenty years old or older to qualify for service in the house of the LORD.  25For David said, "The LORD, the God of Israel, has given us peace, and he will always live in Jerusalem.  26Now the Levites will no longer need to carry the Tabernacle and its utensils from place to place."  27It was according to David's final instructions that all the Levites twenty years old or older were registered for service.28The work of the Levites was to assist the priests, the descendants of Aaron, as they served at the house of the LORD. They also took care of the courtyards and side rooms, helped perform the ceremonies of purification, and served in many other ways in the house of God.  29They were in charge of the sacred bread that was set out on the table, the choice flour for the grain offerings, the wafers made without yeast, the cakes cooked in olive oil, and the other mixed breads. They were also responsible to check all the weights and measures.  30And each morning and evening they stood before the LORD to sing songs of thanks and praise to him.  31They assisted with the burnt offerings that were presented to the LORD on Sabbath days, at new moon celebrations, and at all the appointed festivals. The proper number of Levites served in the LORD's presence at all times, following all the procedures they had been given.32And so, under the supervision of the priests, the Levites watched over the Tabernacle and the Temple[c] and faithfully carried out their duties of service at the house of the LORD.
