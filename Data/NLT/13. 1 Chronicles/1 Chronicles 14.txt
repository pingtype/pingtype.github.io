1Now King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with stonemasons and carpenters to build him a palace. Hiram also sent many cedar logs for lumber.  2And David realized that the LORD had made him king over Israel and had made his kingdom very great for the sake of his people Israel.3Then David married more wives in Jerusalem, and they had many sons and daughters.  4These are the names of David's sons who were born in Jerusalem: Shimea,[a] Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,  5Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,  6Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,  7Elishama, Eliada,[b] and Eliphelet.8When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, they mobilized all their forces to capture him. But David was told they were coming, so he and his men marched out to meet them.  9The Philistines had arrived in the valley of Rephaim and raided it.  10So David asked God, "Should I go out to fight the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?"ÊThe LORD replied, "Yes, go ahead. I will give you the victory."11So David and his troops went to Baal-perazim and defeated the Philistines there. "God has done it!" David exclaimed. "He used me to burst through my enemies like a raging flood!" So that place was named Baal-perazim (which means "the Lord who bursts through").  12The Philistines had abandoned their idols[c] there, so David gave orders to burn them up.13But after a while, the Philistines returned and raided the valley again.  14And once again David asked God what to do. "Do not attack them straight on," God replied. "Instead, circle around behind them and attack them near the balsam trees.  15When you hear a sound like marching feet in the tops of the balsam trees, attack! That will be the signal that God is moving ahead of you to strike down the Philistines."  16So David did what God commanded, and he struck down the Philistine army all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.17So David's fame spread everywhere, and the LORD caused all the nations to fear David.
