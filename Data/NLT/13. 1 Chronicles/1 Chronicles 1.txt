[From Adam to Noah's Sons] 1 The descendants of Adam were Seth, Enosh, 2 Kenan, Mahalalel, Jared, 3 Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech, 4 and Noah. The sons of Noah were[a] Shem, Ham, and Japheth. [Descendants of Japheth] 5 The descendants of Japheth were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.6 The descendants of Gomer were Ashkenaz, Riphath,[b] and Togarmah.7 The descendants of Javan were Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Rodanim. [Descendants of Ham] 8 The descendants of Ham were Cush, Mizraim,[c] Put, and Canaan.9 The descendants of Cush were Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The descendants of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan. 10 Cush was also the ancestor of Nimrod, who was the first heroic warrior on earth.11 Mizraim was the ancestor of the Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites, 12 Pathrusites, Casluhites, and the Caphtorites, from whom the Philistines came.[d]13 Canaan's oldest son was Sidon, the ancestor of the Sidonians. Canaan was also the ancestor of the Hittites,[e] 14 Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites, 15 Hivites, Arkites, Sinites, 16 Arvadites, Zemarites, and Hamathites. [Descendants of Shem] 17 The descendants of Shem were Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram. The descendants of Aram were[f] Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.[g]18 Arphaxad was the father of Shelah. Shelah was the father of Eber.19 Eber had two sons. The first was named Peleg (which means "division"), for during his lifetime the people of the world were divided into different language groups. His brother's name was Joktan.20 Joktan was the ancestor of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 21 Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 22 Obal,[h] Abimael, Sheba, 23 Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were descendants of Joktan.24 So this is the family line descended from Shem: Arphaxad, Shelah,[i] 25 Eber, Peleg, Reu, 26 Serug, Nahor, Terah, 27 and Abram, later known as Abraham. [Descendants of Abraham] 28 The sons of Abraham were Isaac and Ishmael. 29 These are their genealogical records: The sons of Ishmael were Nebaioth (the oldest), Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 30 Mishma, Dumah, Massa, Hadad, Tema, 31 Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. These were the sons of Ishmael.32 The sons of Keturah, Abraham's concubine, were Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. The sons of Jokshan were Sheba and Dedan.33 The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Abraham through his concubine Keturah. [Descendants of Isaac] 34 Abraham was the father of Isaac. The sons of Isaac were Esau and Israel.[j][Descendants of Esau] 35 The sons of Esau were Eliphaz, Reuel, Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.36 The descendants of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho,[k] Gatam, Kenaz, and Amalek, who was born to Timna.[l]37 The descendants of Reuel were Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. [Original Peoples of Edom] 38 The descendants of Seir were Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan.39 The descendants of Lotan were Hori and Hemam.[m] Lotan's sister was named Timna.40 The descendants of Shobal were Alvan,[n] Manahath, Ebal, Shepho,[o] and Onam. The descendants of Zibeon were Aiah and Anah.41 The son of Anah was Dishon. The descendants of Dishon were Hemdan,[p] Eshban, Ithran, and Keran.42 The descendants of Ezer were Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.[q]The descendants of Dishan[r] were Uz and Aran. [Rulers of Edom] 43 These are the kings who ruled in the land of Edom before any king ruled over the Israelites[s]: Bela son of Beor, who ruled from his city of Dinhabah.44 When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah became king in his place.45 When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites became king in his place.46 When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad became king in his place and ruled from the city of Avith. He was the one who destroyed the Midianite army in the land of Moab.47 When Hadad died, Samlah from the city of Masrekah became king in his place.48 When Samlah died, Shaul from the city of Rehoboth-on-the-River became king in his place.49 When Shaul died, Baal-hanan son of Acbor became king in his place.50 When Baal-hanan died, Hadad became king in his place and ruled from the city of Pau.[t] His wife was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred and granddaughter of Me-zahab. 51 Then Hadad died. The clan leaders of Edom were Timna, Alvah,[u] Jetheth, 52 Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon, 53 Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar, 54 Magdiel, and Iram. These are the clan leaders of Edom.       Footnotes:a.   1:4 As in Greek version (see also Gen 5:3-32); Hebrew lacks The sons of Noah were.  b.   1:6 As in some Hebrew manuscripts and Greek version (see also Gen 10:3); most Hebrew manuscripts read Diphath.  c.   1:8 Or Egypt; also in 1:11.  d.   1:12 Hebrew Casluhites, from whom the Philistines came, Caphtorites.
