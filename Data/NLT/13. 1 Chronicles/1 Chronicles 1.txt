1 The descendants of Adam were Seth, Enosh,  2Kenan, Mahalalel, Jared,  3Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech,  4and Noah. The sons of Noah were[a] Shem, Ham, and Japheth.5The descendants of Japheth were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.6The descendants of Gomer were Ashkenaz, Riphath,[b] and Togarmah.7The descendants of Javan were Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Rodanim.8The descendants of Ham were Cush, Mizraim,[c] Put, and Canaan.9The descendants of Cush were Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The descendants of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan.  10Cush was also the ancestor of Nimrod, who was known across the earth as a heroic warrior.11Mizraim was the ancestor of the Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites,  12Pathrusites, Casluhites, and the Caphtorites, from whom the Philistines came.[d]13Canaan's oldest son was Sidon, the ancestor of the Sidonians. Canaan was also the ancestor of the Hittites,  14Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites,  15Hivites, Arkites, Sinites,  16Arvadites, Zemarites, and Hamathites.17The descendants of Shem were Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram. The descendants of Aram were[e] Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.[f]18Arphaxad was the father of Shelah. Shelah was the father of Eber.  19Eber had two sons. The first was named Peleg--"division"--for during his lifetime the people of the world were divided into different language groups and dispersed. His brother's name was Joktan.20Joktan was the ancestor of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,  21Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,  22Obal,[g] Abimael, Sheba,  23Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were descendants of Joktan.24So this is the family line descended from Shem: Arphaxad, Shelah,[h]  25Eber, Peleg, Reu,  26Serug, Nahor, Terah,  27and Abram, later known as Abraham.28The sons of Abraham were Isaac and Ishmael.29The sons of Ishmael were Nebaioth (the oldest), Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,  30Mishma, Dumah, Massa, Hadad, Tema,  31Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. These were the sons of Ishmael.32The sons of Keturah, Abraham's concubine, were Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. The sons of Jokshan were Sheba and Dedan.33The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah.ÊAll these were sons of Abraham by his concubine Keturah.34Abraham was the father of Isaac. The sons of Isaac were Esau and Israel.[i]35The sons of Esau were Eliphaz, Reuel, Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.36The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho,[j] Gatam, Kenaz, and Amalek, who was born to Timna.[k]37The sons of Reuel were Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah.38The sons of Seir were Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan.39The sons of Lotan were Hori and Heman.[l] Lotan's sister was named Timna.40The sons of Shobal were Alvan,[m] Manahath, Ebal, Shepho,[n] and Onam. The sons of Zibeon were Aiah and Anah.41The son of Anah was Dishon. The sons of Dishon were Hemdan,[o] Eshban, Ithran, and Keran.42The sons of Ezer were Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.[p] The sons of Dishan[q] were Uz and Aran.43These are the kings who ruled in Edom before there were kings in Israel[r]: Bela son of Beor, who ruled from his city of Dinhabah.44When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah became king.45When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites became king.46When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad became king and ruled from the city of Avith. He was the one who destroyed the Midianite army in the land of Moab.47When Hadad died, Samlah from the city of Masrekah became king.48When Samlah died, Shaul from the city of Rehoboth on the Euphrates River[s] became king.49When Shaul died, Baal-hanan son of Acbor became king.50When Baal-hanan died, Hadad became king and ruled from the city of Pau.[t] His wife was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred and granddaughter of Me-zahab.  51Then Hadad died. The clan leaders of Edom were Timna, Alvah,[u] Jetheth,  52Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon,  53Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,  54Magdiel, and Iram. These were the clan leaders of Edom.
