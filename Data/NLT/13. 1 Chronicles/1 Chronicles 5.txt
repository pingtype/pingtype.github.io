1The oldest son of Israel[a] was Reuben. But since he dishonored his father by sleeping with one of his father's concubines, his birthright was given to the sons of his brother Joseph. For this reason, Reuben is not listed in the genealogy as the firstborn son.  2It was the descendants of Judah that became the most powerful tribe and provided a ruler for the nation,[b] but the birthright belonged to Joseph.3The sons of Reuben, the oldest son of Israel, were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.4The descendants of Joel were Shemaiah, Gog, Shimei,  5Micah, Reaiah, Baal,  6and Beerah. Beerah was the leader of the Reubenites when they were taken into captivity by King Tiglath-pileser[c] of Assyria.7Beerah's relatives are listed in their genealogy by their clans: Jeiel (the leader), Zechariah,  8and Bela son of Azaz, son of Shema, son of Joel. These Reubenites lived in the area that stretches from Aroer to Nebo and Baal-meon.  9And since they had so many cattle in the land of Gilead, they spread eastward toward the edge of the desert that stretches to the Euphrates River.10During the reign of Saul, the Reubenites defeated the Hagrites in battle. Then they moved into the Hagrite settlements all along the eastern edge of Gilead.11Across from the Reubenites in the land of Bashan lived the descendants of Gad, who were spread as far east as Salecah.  12Joel was the leader in the land of Bashan, and Shapham was second-in-command, along with Janai and Shaphat.13Their relatives, the leaders of seven other clans, were Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jacan, Zia, and Eber.  14These were all descendants of Abihail son of Huri, son of Jaroah, son of Gilead, son of Michael, son of Jeshishai, son of Jahdo, son of Buz.  15Ahi son of Abdiel, son of Guni, was the leader of their clans.16The Gadites lived in the land of Gilead, in Bashan and its villages, and throughout the Sharon Plain.  17All of these were listed in the genealogical records during the days of King Jotham of Judah and King Jeroboam of Israel.18There were 44,760 skilled warriors in the armies of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. They were all skilled in combat and armed with shields, swords, and bows.  19They waged war against the Hagrites, the Jeturites, the Naphishites, and the Nodabites.  20They cried out to God during the battle, and he answered their prayer because they trusted in him. So the Hagrites and all their allies were defeated.  21The plunder taken from the Hagrites included 50,000 camels, 250,000 sheep, 2,000 donkeys, and 100,000 captives. 22Many of the Hagrites were killed in the battle because God was fighting against them. So they lived in their land until they were taken away into exile.23The half-tribe of Manasseh spread through the land from Bashan to Baal-hermon, Senir, and Mount Hermon. They were very numerous.  24These were the leaders of their clans: Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel. Each of these men had a great reputation as a warrior and leader.  25But they were unfaithful and violated their covenant with the God of their ancestors. They worshiped the gods of the nations that God had destroyed.  26So the God of Israel caused King Pul of Assyria (also known as Tiglath-pileser) to invade the land and lead away the people of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh as captives. The Assyrians exiled them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the Gozan River, where they remain to this day.
