1But as for you, promote the kind of living that reflects right teaching.  2Teach the older men to exercise self-control, to be worthy of respect, and to live wisely. They must have strong faith and be filled with love and patience.3Similarly, teach the older women to live in a way that is appropriate for someone serving the Lord. They must not go around speaking evil of others and must not be heavy drinkers. Instead, they should teach others what is good.  4These older women must train the younger women to love their husbands and their children,  5to live wisely and be pure, to take care of their homes, to do good, and to be submissive to their husbands. Then they will not bring shame on the word of God.6In the same way, encourage the young men to live wisely in all they do.  7And you yourself must be an example to them by doing good deeds of every kind. Let everything you do reflect the integrity and seriousness of your teaching.  8Let your teaching be so correct that it can't be criticized. Then those who want to argue will be ashamed because they won't have anything bad to say about us.9Slaves must obey their masters and do their best to please them. They must not talk back  10or steal, but they must show themselves to be entirely trustworthy and good. Then they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive in every way.11For the grace of God has been revealed, bringing salvation to all people.  12And we are instructed to turn from godless living and sinful pleasures. We should live in this evil world with self-control, right conduct, and devotion to God,  13while we look forward to that wonderful event when the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, will be revealed.  14He gave his life to free us from every kind of sin, to cleanse us, and to make us his very own people, totally committed to doing what is right.  15You must teach these things and encourage your people to do them, correcting them when necessary. You have the authority to do this, so don't let anyone ignore you or disregard what you say.
