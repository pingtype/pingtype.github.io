1This letter is from Paul, a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ. I have been sent to bring faith to those God has chosen and to teach them to know the truth that shows them how to live godly lives.  2This truth gives them the confidence of eternal life, which God promised them before the world began--and he cannot lie.  3And now at the right time he has revealed this Good News, and we announce it to everyone. It is by the command of God our Savior that I have been trusted to do this work for him.4This letter is written to Titus, my true child in the faith that we share. May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior give you grace and peace.5I left you on the island of Crete so you could complete our work there and appoint elders in each town as I instructed you.  6An elder must be well thought of for his good life. He must be faithful to his wife,[a] and his children must be believers who are not wild or rebellious.  7An elder[b] must live a blameless life because he is God's minister. He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered; he must not be a heavy drinker, violent, or greedy for money.  8He must enjoy having guests in his home and must love all that is good. He must live wisely and be fair. He must live a devout and disciplined life.  9He must have a strong and steadfast belief in the trustworthy message he was taught; then he will be able to encourage others with right teaching and show those who oppose it where they are wrong.10For there are many who rebel against right teaching; they engage in useless talk and deceive people. This is especially true of those who insist on circumcision for salvation.  11They must be silenced. By their wrong teaching, they have already turned whole families away from the truth. Such teachers only want your money.  12One of their own men, a prophet from Crete, has said about them, "The people of Crete are all liars; they are cruel animals and lazy gluttons."  13This is true. So rebuke them as sternly as necessary to make them strong in the faith.  14They must stop listening to Jewish myths and the commands of people who have turned their backs on the truth.15Everything is pure to those whose hearts are pure. But nothing is pure to those who are corrupt and unbelieving, because their minds and consciences are defiled.  16Such people claim they know God, but they deny him by the way they live. They are despicable and disobedient, worthless for doing anything good.
