1 That was the beginning of a long war between those who had been loyal to Saul and those who were loyal to David. As time passed David became stronger and stronger, while Saul's dynasty became weaker and weaker.2These were the sons who were born to David in Hebron: The oldest was Amnon, whose mother was Ahinoam of Jezreel.3 The second was Kileab, whose mother was Abigail, the widow of Nabal from Carmel. The third was Absalom, whose mother was Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur.4 The fourth was Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith. The fifth was Shephatiah, whose mother was Abital.5 The sixth was Ithream, whose mother was David's wife Eglah. These sons were all born to David in Hebron.6As the war went on, Abner became a powerful leader among those who were loyal to Saul's dynasty.  7One day Ishbosheth,[a] Saul's son, accused Abner of sleeping with one of his father's concubines, a woman named Rizpah.  8Abner became furious. "Am I a Judean dog to be kicked around like this?" he shouted. "After all I have done for you and your father by not betraying you to David, is this my reward--that you find fault with me about this woman?  9May God deal harshly with me if I don't help David get all that the LORD has promised him!  10I should just go ahead and give David the rest of Saul's kingdom. I should set him up as king over Israel as well as Judah, from Dan to Beersheba."  11Ishbosheth didn't dare say another word because he was afraid of what Abner might do.12Then Abner sent messengers to David, saying, "Let's make an agreement, and I will help turn the entire nation of Israel over to you."13"All right," David replied, "but I will not negotiate with you unless you bring back my wife Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come."14David then sent this message to Ishbosheth, Saul's son: "Give me back my wife Michal, for I bought her with the lives of one hundred Philistines."  15So Ishbosheth took Michal away from her husband Palti[b] son of Laish.  16Palti followed along behind her as far as Bahurim, weeping as he went. Then Abner told him, "Go back home!" So Palti returned.17Meanwhile, Abner had consulted with the leaders of Israel. "For some time now," he told them, "you have wanted to make David your king.  18Now is the time! For the LORD has said, `I have chosen David to save my people from the Philistines and from all their other enemies.' "  19Abner also spoke with the leaders of the tribe of Benjamin. Then he went to Hebron to tell David that all the people of Israel and Benjamin supported him.20When Abner came to Hebron with his twenty men, David entertained them with a great feast.  21Then Abner said to David, "Let me go and call all the people of Israel to your side. They will make a covenant with you to make you their king. Then you will be able to rule over everything your heart desires." So David sent Abner safely on his way.22But just after Abner left, Joab and some of David's troops returned from a raid, bringing much plunder with them.  23When Joab was told that Abner had just been there visiting the king and had been sent away in safety,  24he rushed to see the king. "What have you done?" he demanded. "What do you mean by letting Abner get away?  25You know perfectly well that he came to spy on you and to discover everything you are doing!"26Joab then left David and sent messengers to catch up with Abner. They found him at the pool of Sirah and brought him back with them. But David knew nothing about it.  27When Abner arrived at Hebron, Joab took him aside at the gateway as if to speak with him privately. But then he drew his dagger and killed Abner in revenge for killing his brother Asahel.28When David heard about it, he declared, "I vow by the LORD that I and my people are innocent of this crime against Abner.  29Joab and his family are the guilty ones. May his family in every generation be cursed with a man who has open sores or leprosy[c] or who walks on crutches[d] or who dies by the sword or who begs for food!"30So Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because Abner had killed their brother Asahel at the battle of Gibeon.31Then David said to Joab and all those who were with him, "Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth. Go into deep mourning for Abner." And King David himself walked behind the procession to the grave.  32They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king and all the people wept at his graveside.  33Then the king sang this funeral song for Abner: "Should Abner have died as fools die?34 Your hands were not bound; your feet were not chained. No, you were murdered-- the victim of a wicked plot." All the people wept again for Abner.  35David had refused to eat anything the day of the funeral, and now everyone begged him to eat. But David had made a vow, saying, "May God kill me if I eat anything before sundown."  36This pleased the people very much. In fact, everything the king did pleased them!  37So everyone in Judah and Israel knew that David was not responsible for Abner's death.38Then King David said to the people, "Do you not realize that a great leader and a great man has fallen today in Israel?  39And even though I am the anointed king, these two sons of Zeruiah--Joab and Abishai--are too strong for me to control. So may the LORD repay these wicked men for their wicked deeds."
