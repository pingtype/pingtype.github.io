1One day David began wondering if anyone in Saul's family was still alive, for he had promised Jonathan that he would show kindness to them.  2He summoned a man named Ziba, who had been one of Saul's servants. "Are you Ziba?" the king asked. "Yes sir, I am," Ziba replied.3The king then asked him, "Is anyone still alive from Saul's family? If so, I want to show God's kindness to them in any way I can." Ziba replied, "Yes, one of Jonathan's sons is still alive, but he is crippled."4"Where is he?" the king asked. "In Lo-debar," Ziba told him, "at the home of Makir son of Ammiel."  5So David sent for him and brought him from Makir's home.  6His name was Mephibosheth[a]; he was Jonathan's son and Saul's grandson. When he came to David, he bowed low in great fear and said, "I am your servant."7But David said, "Don't be afraid! I've asked you to come so that I can be kind to you because of my vow to your father, Jonathan. I will give you all the land that once belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you may live here with me at the palace!"8Mephibosheth fell to the ground before the king. "Should the king show such kindness to a dead dog like me?" he exclaimed.9Then the king summoned Saul's servant Ziba and said, "I have given your master's grandson everything that belonged to Saul and his family.  10You and your sons and servants are to farm the land for him to produce food for his family. But Mephibosheth will live here at the palace with me." Ziba, who had fifteen sons and twenty servants, replied,  11"Yes, my lord; I will do all that you have commanded." And from that time on, Mephibosheth ate regularly with David, as though he were one of his own sons.  12Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica. And from then on, all the members of Ziba's household were Mephibosheth's servants.  13And Mephibosheth, who was crippled in both feet, moved to Jerusalem to live at the palace.
