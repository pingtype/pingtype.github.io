1This letter is from John the Elder.[a] It is written to Gaius, my dear friend, whom I love in the truth.2Dear friend, I am praying that all is well with you and that your body is as healthy as I know your soul is. 3Some of the brothers recently returned and made me very happy by telling me about your faithfulness and that you are living in the truth.  4I could have no greater joy than to hear that my children live in the truth.5Dear friend, you are doing a good work for God when you take care of the traveling teachers[b] who are passing through, even though they are strangers to you.  6They have told the church here of your friendship and your loving deeds. You do well to send them on their way in a manner that pleases God.  7For they are traveling for the Lord[c] and accept nothing from those who are not Christians.[d]  8So we ourselves should support them so that we may become partners with them for the truth.9I sent a brief letter to the church about this, but Diotrephes, who loves to be the leader, does not acknowledge our authority.  10When I come, I will report some of the things he is doing and the wicked things he is saying about us. He not only refuses to welcome the traveling teachers, he also tells others not to help them. And when they do help, he puts them out of the church.11Dear friend, don't let this bad example influence you. Follow only what is good. Remember that those who do good prove that they are God's children, and those who do evil prove that they do not know God. 12But everyone speaks highly of Demetrius, even truth itself. We ourselves can say the same for him, and you know we speak the truth.13I have much to tell you, but I don't want to do it in a letter.  14For I hope to see you soon, and then we will talk face to face.15May God's peace be with you. Your friends here send you their greetings. Please give my personal greetings to each of our friends there.
