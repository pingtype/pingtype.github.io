1When Joshua was an old man, the LORD said to him, "You are growing old, and much land remains to be conquered.  2The people still need to occupy the land of the Philistines and the Geshurites--  3territory that belongs to the Canaanites. This land extends from the stream of Shihor, which is on the boundary of Egypt, northward to the boundary of Ekron,  4and includes the five Philistine cities of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron. The land of the Avvites in the south also remains to be conquered. In the north, this area has not yet been conquered: all the land of the Canaanites, including Mearah (which belongs to the Sidonians), stretching northward to Aphek on the border of the Amorites;  5the land of the Gebalites and all of the Lebanon mountain area to the east, from Baal-gad beneath Mount Hermon to Lebo-hamath;  6and all the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, including all the land of the Sidonians. "I will drive these people out of the land for the Israelites. So be sure to give this land to Israel as a special possession, just as I have commanded you.  7Include all this territory as Israel's inheritance when you divide the land among the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh."8Half the tribe of Manasseh and the tribes of Reuben and Gad had already received their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan, for Moses, the servant of the LORD, had previously assigned this land to them.9Their territory extended from Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Gorge (including the town in the middle of the gorge) to the plain beyond Medeba, as far as Dibon.  10It also included all the towns of King Sihon of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, and extended as far as the borders of Ammon.  11It included Gilead, the territory of the kingdoms of Geshur and Maacah, all of Mount Hermon, all of Bashan as far as Salecah,  12and all the territory of King Og of Bashan, who had reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei. King Og was the last of the Rephaites, for Moses had attacked them and driven them out.  13But the Israelites failed to drive out the people of Geshur and Maacah, so they continue to live among the Israelites to this day.14Moses did not assign any land to the tribe of Levi. Instead, as the LORD had promised them, their inheritance came from the offerings burned on the altar to the LORD, the God of Israel.15Moses had assigned the following area to the families of the tribe of Reuben.16Their territory extended from Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Gorge (including the town in the middle of the gorge) to the plain beyond Medeba.  17It included Heshbon and the other towns on the plain--Dibon, Bamoth-baal, Beth-baal-meon,  18Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath,  19Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth-shahar on the hill above the valley,  20Beth-peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth.21The land of Reuben also included all the towns of the plain and the entire kingdom of Sihon. Sihon was the Amorite king who had reigned in Heshbon and was killed by Moses along with the chiefs of Midian--Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba--princes living in the region who were allied with Sihon.  22The Israelites also killed Balaam the magician, the son of Beor.  23The Jordan River marked the western boundary for the tribe of Reuben. The towns and villages in this area were given as an inheritance to the families of the tribe of Reuben.24Moses had assigned the following area to the families of the tribe of Gad.25Their territory included Jazer, all the towns of Gilead, and half of the land of Ammon, as far as the town of Aroer just west of Rabbah.  26It extended from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to Lo-debar.[a]  27In the valley were Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth, Zaphon, and the rest of the kingdom of King Sihon of Heshbon. The Jordan River was the western border, extending as far north as the Sea of Galilee.[b]  28The towns and villages in this area were given as an inheritance to the families of the tribe of Gad.29Moses had assigned the following area to the families of the half-tribe of Manasseh.30Their territory extended from Mahanaim, including all of Bashan, all the former kingdom of King Og, and the sixty towns of Jair in Bashan.  31It also included half of Gilead and King Og's royal cities of Ashtaroth and Edrei. All this was given to the descendants of Makir, who was Manasseh's son.32These are the allotments Moses had made while he was on the plains of Moab, across the Jordan River, east of Jericho.  33But Moses gave no land to the tribe of Levi, for the LORD, the God of Israel, had promised to be their inheritance.
