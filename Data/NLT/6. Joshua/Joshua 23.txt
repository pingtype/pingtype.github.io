1The years passed, and the LORD had given the people of Israel rest from all their enemies. Joshua, who was now very old,  2called together all the elders, leaders, judges, and officers of Israel. He said to them, "I am an old man now.  3You have seen everything the LORD your God has done for you during my lifetime. The LORD your God has fought for you against your enemies.  4I have allotted to you as an inheritance all the land of the nations yet unconquered, as well as the land of those we have already conquered--from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea[a] in the west.  5This land will be yours, for the LORD your God will drive out all the people living there now. You will live there instead of them, just as the LORD your God promised you.6"So be strong! Be very careful to follow all the instructions written in the Book of the Law of Moses. Do not deviate from them in any way.  7Make sure you do not associate with the other people still remaining in the land. Do not even mention the names of their gods, much less swear by them or worship them.  8But be faithful to the LORD your God as you have done until now.9"For the LORD has driven out great and powerful nations for you, and no one has yet been able to defeat you.  10Each one of you will put to flight a thousand of the enemy, for the LORD your God fights for you, just as he has promised.  11So be very careful to love the LORD your God.12"But if you turn away from him and intermarry with the survivors of these nations remaining among you, 
13then know for certain that the LORD your God will no longer drive them out from your land. Instead, they will be a snare and a trap to you, a pain in your side and a thorn in your eyes, and you will be wiped out from this good land the LORD your God has given you.14"Soon I will die, going the way of all the earth. Deep in your hearts you know that every promise of the LORD your God has come true. Not a single one has failed!  15But as surely as the LORD your God has given you the good things he promised, he will also bring disaster on you if you disobey him. He will completely wipe you out from this good land he has given you.  16If you break the covenant of the LORD your God by worshiping and serving other gods, his anger will burn against you, and you will quickly be wiped out from the good land he has given you."
