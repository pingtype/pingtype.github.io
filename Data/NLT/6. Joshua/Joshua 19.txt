1The second allotment of land went to the families of the tribe of Simeon. Their inheritance was surrounded by Judah's territory.2Simeon's inheritance included Beersheba, Sheba, Moladah,  3Hazar-shual, Balah, Ezem,  4Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah,  5Ziklag, Beth-marcaboth, Hazar-susah,  6Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen--thirteen towns with their villages.  7It also included Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan--four towns with their villages,  8including all the villages as far south as Baalath-beer (also known as Ramah of the Negev). This was the inheritance of the families of the tribe of Simeon.  9Their inheritance came from part of what had been given to Judah because Judah's territory was too large for them. So the tribe of Simeon received an inheritance within the territory of Judah.10The third allotment of land went to the families of the tribe of Zebulun. The boundary of Zebulun's inheritance started at Sarid.  11From there it went west, going past Maralah, touching Dabbesheth, and proceeding to the brook east of Jokneam.  12In the other direction, the boundary line went east from Sarid to the border of Kisloth-tabor, and from there to Daberath and up to Japhia. 13Then it continued east to Gath-hepher, Eth-kazin, and Rimmon and turned toward Neah.  14The northern boundary of Zebulun passed Hannathon and ended at the valley of Iphtah-el.  15The towns in these areas included Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem--twelve towns with their surrounding villages.16This was the inheritance of the families of the tribe of Zebulun.17The fourth allotment of land went to the families of the tribe of Issachar.18Its boundaries included the following towns: Jezreel, Kesulloth, Shunem,  19Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath,  20Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez,  21Remeth, En-gannim, En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez.  22The boundary also touched Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth-shemesh, ending at the Jordan River--sixteen towns with their surrounding villages.23This was the inheritance of the families of the tribe of Issachar.24The fifth allotment of land went to the families of the tribe of Asher.25Its boundaries included these towns: Helkath, Hali, Beten, Acshaph,  26Allammelech, Amad, and Mishal. The boundary on the west went from Carmel to Shihor-libnath,  27turned east toward Beth-dagon, and ran as far as Zebulun in the valley of Iphtah-el, running north to Beth-emek and Neiel. It then continued north to Cabul,  28Abdon,[a] Rehob, Hammon, Kanah, and as far as Greater Sidon.  29Then the boundary turned toward Ramah and the fortified city of Tyre and came to the Mediterranean Sea[b] at Hosah. The territory also included Mehebel, Aczib,  30Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob--twenty-two towns with their surrounding villages.31This was the inheritance of the families of the tribe of Asher.32The sixth allotment of land went to the families of the tribe of Naphtali.33Its boundary ran from Heleph, from the oak at Zaanannim, and extended across to Adami-nekeb, Jabneel, and as far as Lakkum, ending at the Jordan River.  34The western boundary ran past Aznoth-tabor, then to Hukkok, and touched the boundary of Zebulun in the south, the boundary of Asher on the west, and the Jordan River[c] on the east.  35The fortified cities included in this territory were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Kinnereth,  36Adamah, Ramah, Hazor,  37Kedesh, Edrei, En-hazor,  38Yiron, Migdal-el, Horem, Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh--nineteen cities with their surrounding villages.39This was the inheritance of the families of the tribe of Naphtali.40The seventh and last allotment of land went to the families of the tribe of Dan.41The towns within Dan's inheritance included Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir-shemesh,  42Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah, 43Elon, Timnah, Ekron,  44Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath,  45Jehud, Bene-berak, Gath-rimmon,  46and Me-jarkon, also Rakkon along with the territory across from Joppa.47But the tribe of Dan had trouble taking possession of their land, so they fought against the town of Laish.[d] They captured it, slaughtered its people, and settled there. They renamed the city Dan after their ancestor.48This was the inheritance of the families of the tribe of Dan--these towns with their villages.49After all the land was divided among the tribes, the Israelites gave a special piece of land to Joshua as his inheritance.  50For the LORD had said he could have any town he wanted. He chose Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim. He rebuilt the town and lived there.51These are the territories that Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the tribal leaders gave as an inheritance to the tribes of Israel by casting sacred lots in the presence of the LORD at the entrance of the Tabernacle[e] at Shiloh. So the division of the land was completed.
