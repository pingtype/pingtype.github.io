1After the death of Moses the LORD's servant, the LORD spoke to Joshua son of Nun, Moses' assistant. He said,  2"Now that my servant Moses is dead, you must lead my people across the Jordan River into the land I am giving them.  3I promise you what I promised Moses: `Everywhere you go, you will be on land I have given you--  4from the Negev Desert in the south to the Lebanon mountains in the north, from the Euphrates River on the east to the Mediterranean Sea[a] on the west, and all the land of the Hittites.'  5No one will be able to stand their ground against you as long as you live. For I will be with you as I was with Moses. I will not fail you or abandon you.6"Be strong and courageous, for you will lead my people to possess all the land I swore to give their ancestors.  7Be strong and very courageous. Obey all the laws Moses gave you. Do not turn away from them, and you will be successful in everything you do.  8Study this Book of the Law continually. Meditate on it day and night so you may be sure to obey all that is written in it. Only then will you succeed.  9I command you--be strong and courageous! Do not be afraid or discouraged. For the LORD your God is with you wherever you go."10Joshua then commanded the leaders of Israel,  11"Go through the camp and tell the people to get their provisions ready. In three days you will cross the Jordan River and take possession of the land the LORD your God has given you."12Then Joshua called together the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. He told them, 
13"Remember what Moses, the servant of the LORD, commanded you: `The LORD your God is giving you rest and has given you this land.'  14Your wives, children, and cattle may remain here on the east side of the Jordan River, but your warriors, fully armed, must lead the other tribes across the Jordan to help them conquer their territory. Stay with them  15until the LORD gives rest to them as he has given rest to you, and until they, too, possess the land the LORD your God is giving them. Only then may you settle here on the east side of the Jordan River in the land that Moses, the servant of the LORD, gave you."16They answered Joshua, "We will do whatever you command us, and we will go wherever you send us. 17We will obey you just as we obeyed Moses. And may the LORD your God be with you as he was with Moses. 18Anyone who rebels against your word and does not obey your every command will be put to death. So be strong and courageous!"
