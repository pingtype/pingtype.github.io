1 The allotment to the descendants of Joseph extended from the Jordan River near Jericho, east of the waters of Jericho, through the wilderness and into the hill country of Bethel.  2From Bethel (that is, Luz)[a] it ran over to Ataroth in the territory of the Arkites.  3Then it descended westward to the territory of the Japhletites as far as Lower Beth-horon, then to Gezer and on over to the Mediterranean Sea.[b]4The families of Joseph's sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, received their inheritance.5The following territory was given to the families of the tribe of Ephraim as their inheritance. The eastern boundary of their inheritance began at Ataroth-addar. From there it ran to Upper Beth-horon, 6then on to the Mediterranean Sea. The northern boundary began at the Mediterranean, ran east past Micmethath, then curved eastward past Taanath-shiloh to the east of Janoah.  7From Janoah it turned southward to Ataroth and Naarah, touched Jericho, and ended at the Jordan River.  8From Tappuah the border extended westward, following the Kanah Ravine to the Mediterranean Sea. This is the inheritance given to the families of the tribe of Ephraim.9Ephraim was also given some towns with surrounding villages in the territory of the half-tribe of Manasseh.  10They did not drive the Canaanites out of Gezer, however, so the people of Gezer live as slaves among the people of Ephraim to this day.
