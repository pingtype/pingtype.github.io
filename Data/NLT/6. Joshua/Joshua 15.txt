1The land assigned to the families of the tribe of Judah reached southward to the border of Edom, with the wilderness of Zin being its southernmost point.2The southern boundary began at the south bay of the Dead Sea,[a]  3ran south of Scorpion Pass[b] into the wilderness of Zin and went south of Kadesh-barnea to Hezron. Then it went up to Addar, where it turned toward Karka.  4From there it passed to Azmon, until it finally reached the brook of Egypt, which it followed to the Mediterranean Sea.[c] This was their[d] southern boundary.5The eastern boundary extended along the Dead Sea to the mouth of the Jordan River. The northern boundary began at the bay where the Jordan River empties into the Dead Sea,  6crossed to Beth-hoglah, then proceeded north of Beth-arabah to the stone of Bohan. (Bohan was Reuben's son.)  7From that point it went through the valley of Achor to Debir, turning north toward Gilgal, which is across from the slopes of Adummim on the south side of the valley. From there the border extended to the springs at En-shemesh and on to En-rogel.  8The boundary then passed through the valley of the son of Hinnom, along the southern slopes of the Jebusites, where the city of Jerusalem is located. Then it went west to the top of the mountain above the valley of Hinnom, and on up to the northern end of the valley of Rephaim.  9From there the border extended from the top of the mountain to the spring at the waters of Nephtoah,[e] and from there to the towns on Mount Ephron. Then it turned toward Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim).  10The border circled west of Baalah to Mount Seir, passed along to the town of Kesalon on the northern slope of Mount Jearim, and went down to Beth-shemesh and on to Timnah.  11The boundary line then proceeded to the slope of the hill north of Ekron, where it turned toward Shikkeron and Mount Baalah. It passed Jabneel and ended at the Mediterranean Sea.12The western boundary was the shoreline of the Mediterranean Sea.[f] These are the boundaries for the families of the tribe of Judah.13The LORD instructed Joshua to assign some of Judah's territory to Caleb son of Jephunneh. So Caleb was given the city of Arba (that is, Hebron), which had been named after Anak's ancestor.  14Caleb drove out the three Anakites--Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai--descendants of Anak.15Then he fought against the people living in the town of Debir (formerly called Kiriath-sepher).  16Caleb said, "I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage to the one who attacks and captures Kiriath-sepher." 17Othniel, the son of Caleb's brother Kenaz, was the one who conquered it, so Acsah became Othniel's wife.18When Acsah married Othniel, she urged him[g] to ask her father for an additional field. As she got down off her donkey, Caleb asked her, "What is it? What can I do for you?"19She said, "Give me a further blessing. You have been kind enough to give me land in the Negev; please give me springs as well." So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.20This was the inheritance given to the families of the tribe of Judah.21The towns of Judah situated along the borders of Edom in the extreme south are Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur, 22Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah,  23Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan,  24Ziph, Telem, Bealoth,  25Hazor-hadattah, Kerioth-hezron (that is, Hazor),  26Amam, Shema, Moladah,  27Hazar-gaddah, Heshmon, Beth-pelet,  28Hazar-shual, Beersheba, Biziothiah,  29Baalah, Iim, Ezem,  30Eltolad, Kesil, Hormah,  31Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah, 32Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon. In all, there were twenty-nine of these towns with their surrounding villages.33The following towns situated in the western foothills[h] were also given to Judah: Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah, 34Zanoah, En-gannim, Tappuah, Enam,  35Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, Azekah,  36Shaaraim, Adithaim, Gederah, and Gederothaim. In all, there were fourteen towns with their surrounding villages.37Also included were Zenan, Hadashah, Migdal-gad,  38Dilean, Mizpeh, Joktheel,  39Lachish, Bozkath, Eglon, 40Cabbon, Lahmam, Kitlish,  41Gederoth, Beth-dagon, Naamah, and Makkedah--sixteen towns with their surrounding villages.  42Besides these, there were Libnah, Ether, Ashan,  43Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib,  44Keilah, Aczib, and Mareshah--nine towns with their surrounding villages.45The territory of the tribe of Judah also included all the towns and villages of Ekron.  46From Ekron the boundary extended west and included the towns near Ashdod with their surrounding villages.  47It also included Ashdod with its towns and villages and Gaza with its towns and villages, as far as the brook of Egypt and along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.48Judah also received the following towns in the hill country: Shamir, Jattir, Socoh,  49Dannah, Kiriath-sannah (that is, Debir),  50Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim,  51Goshen, Holon, and Giloh--eleven towns with their surrounding villages.52Also included were the towns of Arab, Dumah, Eshan,  53Janim, Beth-tappuah, Aphekah,  54Humtah, Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), and Zior--nine towns with their surrounding villages.55Besides these, there were Maon, Carmel, Ziph, Juttah,  56Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah,  57Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah--ten towns with their surrounding villages.58In addition, there were Halhul, Beth-zur, Gedor,  59Maarath, Beth-anoth, and Eltekon--six towns with their surrounding villages.  60There were also Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim) and Rabbah--two towns with their surrounding villages.61In the wilderness there were the towns of Beth-arabah, Middin, Secacah,  62Nibshan, the City of Salt, and En-gedi--six towns with their surrounding villages.63But the tribe of Judah could not drive out the Jebusites, who lived in the city of Jerusalem, so the Jebusites live there among the people of Judah to this day.
