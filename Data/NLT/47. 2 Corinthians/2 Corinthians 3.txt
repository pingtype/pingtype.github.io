1 Are we beginning again to tell you how good we are? Some people need to bring letters of recommendation with them or ask you to write letters of recommendation for them.  
2But the only letter of recommendation we need is you yourselves! Your lives are a letter written in our[a] hearts, and everyone can read it and recognize our good work among you.  
3Clearly, you are a letter from Christ prepared by us. It is written not with pen and ink, but with the Spirit of the living God. It is carved not on stone, but on human hearts.
4We are confident of all this because of our great trust in God through Christ.  
5It is not that we think we can do anything of lasting value by ourselves. Our only power and success come from God.  
6He is the one who has enabled us to represent his new covenant. This is a covenant, not of written laws, but of the Spirit. The old way ends in death; in the new way, the Holy Spirit gives life.
7That old system of law etched in stone led to death, yet it began with such glory that the people of Israel could not bear to look at Moses' face. For his face shone with the glory of God, even though the brightness was already fading away.  
8Shouldn't we expect far greater glory when the Holy Spirit is giving life?  
9If the old covenant, which brings condemnation, was glorious, how much more glorious is the new covenant, which makes us right with God!  
10In fact, that first glory was not glorious at all compared with the overwhelming glory of the new covenant.  
11So if the old covenant, which has been set aside, was full of glory, then the new covenant, which remains forever, has far greater glory.
12Since this new covenant gives us such confidence, we can be very bold.  
13We are not like Moses, who put a veil over his face so the people of Israel would not see the glory fading away.  
14But the people's minds were hardened, and even to this day whenever the old covenant is being read, a veil covers their minds so they cannot understand the truth. And this veil can be removed only by believing in Christ.  
15Yes, even today when they read Moses' writings, their hearts are covered with that veil, and they do not understand.
16But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, then the veil is taken away.  
17Now, the Lord is the Spirit, and wherever the Spirit of the Lord is, he gives freedom.  
18And all of us have had that veil removed so that we can be mirrors that brightly reflect[b] the glory of the Lord. And as the Spirit of the Lord works within us, we become more and more like him and reflect his glory even more.
