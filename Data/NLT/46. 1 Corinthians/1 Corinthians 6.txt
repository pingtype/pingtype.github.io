1When you have something against another Christian, why do you file a lawsuit and ask a secular court to decide the matter, instead of taking it to other Christians to decide who is right?  
2Don't you know that someday we Christians are going to judge the world? And since you are going to judge the world, can't you decide these little things among yourselves?  
3Don't you realize that we Christians will judge angels? So you should surely be able to resolve ordinary disagreements here on earth.  
4If you have legal disputes about such matters, why do you go to outside judges who are not respected by the church?  
5I am saying this to shame you. Isn't there anyone in all the church who is wise enough to decide these arguments?  
6But instead, one Christian[a] sues another--right in front of unbelievers!
7To have such lawsuits at all is a real defeat for you. Why not just accept the injustice and leave it at that? Why not let yourselves be cheated?  
8But instead, you yourselves are the ones who do wrong and cheat even your own Christian brothers and sisters.[b]
9Don't you know that those who do wrong will have no share in the Kingdom of God? Don't fool yourselves. Those who indulge in sexual sin, who are idol worshipers, adulterers, male prostitutes, homosexuals, 10thieves, greedy people, drunkards, abusers, and swindlers--none of these will have a share in the Kingdom of God.  
11There was a time when some of you were just like that, but now your sins have been washed away,[c] and you have been set apart for God. You have been made right with God because of what the Lord Jesus Christ and the Spirit of our God have done for you.
12You may say, "I am allowed to do anything." But I reply, "Not everything is good for you." And even though "I am allowed to do anything," I must not become a slave to anything.  
13You say, "Food is for the stomach, and the stomach is for food." This is true, though someday God will do away with both of them. But our bodies were not made for sexual immorality. They were made for the Lord, and the Lord cares about our bodies.  
14And God will raise our bodies from the dead by his marvelous power, just as he raised our Lord from the dead.  
15Don't you realize that your bodies are actually parts of Christ? Should a man take his body, which belongs to Christ, and join it to a prostitute? Never!  
16And don't you know that if a man joins himself to a prostitute, he becomes one body with her? For the Scriptures say, "The two are united into one."[d]  
17But the person who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.
18Run away from sexual sin! No other sin so clearly affects the body as this one does. For sexual immorality is a sin against your own body.  
19Or don't you know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, who lives in you and was given to you by God? You do not belong to yourself,  
20for God bought you with a high price. So you must honor God with your body.
