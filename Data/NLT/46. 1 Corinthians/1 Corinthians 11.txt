1 And you should follow my example, just as I follow Christ's.
2I am so glad, dear friends, that you always keep me in your thoughts and you are following the Christian teaching I passed on to you.  
3But there is one thing I want you to know: A man is responsible to Christ, a woman is responsible to her husband, and Christ is responsible to God.  
4A man dishonors Christ[a] if he covers his head while praying or prophesying.  
5But a woman dishonors her husband[b] if she prays or prophesies without a covering on her head, for this is the same as shaving her head.  
6Yes, if she refuses to wear a head covering, she should cut off all her hair. And since it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut or her head shaved, then she should wear a covering.[c]  
7A man should not wear anything on his head when worshiping, for man is God's glory, made in God's own image, but woman is the glory of man.  
8For the first man didn't come from woman, but the first woman came from man.  
9And man was not made for woman's benefit, but woman was made for man.  
10So a woman should wear a covering on her head as a sign of authority because the angels are watching.
11But in relationships among the Lord's people, women are not independent of men, and men are not independent of women.  
12For although the first woman came from man, all men have been born from women ever since, and everything comes from God.
13What do you think about this? Is it right for a woman to pray to God in public without covering her head? 14Isn't it obvious that it's disgraceful for a man to have long hair?  
15And isn't it obvious that long hair is a woman's pride and joy? For it has been given to her as a covering.  
16But if anyone wants to argue about this, all I can say is that we have no other custom than this, and all the churches of God feel the same way about it.
17But now when I mention this next issue, I cannot praise you. For it sounds as if more harm than good is done when you meet together.  
18First of all, I hear that there are divisions among you when you meet as a church, and to some extent I believe it.  
19But, of course, there must be divisions among you so that those of you who are right will be recognized!
20It's not the Lord's Supper you are concerned about when you come together.  
21For I am told that some of you hurry to eat your own meal without sharing with others. As a result, some go hungry while others get drunk.  
22What? Is this really true? Don't you have your own homes for eating and drinking? Or do you really want to disgrace the church of God and shame the poor? What am I supposed to say about these things? Do you want me to praise you? Well, I certainly do not!
23For this is what the Lord himself said, and I pass it on to you just as I received it. On the night when he was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took a loaf of bread,  
24and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "This is my body, which is given[d] for you. Do this in remembrance of me."  
25In the same way, he took the cup of wine after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant between God and you, sealed by the shedding of my blood. Do this in remembrance of me as often as you drink it."  
26For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are announcing the Lord's death until he comes again.
27So if anyone eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord unworthily, that person is guilty of sinning against the body and the blood of the Lord.  
28That is why you should examine yourself before eating the bread and drinking from the cup.  
29For if you eat the bread or drink the cup unworthily, not honoring the body of Christ,[e] you are eating and drinking God's judgment upon yourself.  
30That is why many of you are weak and sick and some have even died.
31But if we examine ourselves, we will not be examined by God and judged in this way.  
32But when we are judged and disciplined by the Lord, we will not be condemned with the world.  
33So, dear brothers and sisters,[f] when you gather for the Lord's Supper, wait for each other.  
34If you are really hungry, eat at home so you won't bring judgment upon yourselves when you meet together. I'll give you instructions about the other matters after I arrive.
