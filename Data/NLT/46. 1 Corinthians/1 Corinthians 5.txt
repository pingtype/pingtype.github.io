1I can hardly believe the report about the sexual immorality going on among you, something so evil that even the pagans don't do it. I am told that you have a man in your church who is living in sin with his father's wife.  
2And you are so proud of yourselves! Why aren't you mourning in sorrow and shame? And why haven't you removed this man from your fellowship?
3Even though I am not there with you in person, I am with you in the Spirit.[a] Concerning the one who has done this, I have already passed judgment  
4in the name of the Lord Jesus. You are to call a meeting of the church,[b] and I will be there in spirit, and the power of the Lord Jesus will be with you as you meet. 
5Then you must cast this man out of the church and into Satan's hands, so that his sinful nature will be destroyed[c] and he himself[d] will be saved when the Lord returns.
6How terrible that you should boast about your spirituality, and yet you let this sort of thing go on. Don't you realize that if even one person is allowed to go on sinning, soon all will be affected?  
7Remove this wicked person from among you so that you can stay pure.[e] Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed for us. 
8So let us celebrate the festival, not by eating the old bread[f] of wickedness and evil, but by eating the new bread[g] of purity and truth.
9When I wrote to you before, I told you not to associate with people who indulge in sexual sin.  
10But I wasn't talking about unbelievers who indulge in sexual sin, or who are greedy or are swindlers or idol worshipers. You would have to leave this world to avoid people like that.  
11What I meant was that you are not to associate with anyone who claims to be a Christian[h] yet indulges in sexual sin, or is greedy, or worships idols, or is abusive, or a drunkard, or a swindler. Don't even eat with such people.
12It isn't my responsibility to judge outsiders, but it certainly is your job to judge those inside the church who are sinning in these ways.  
13God will judge those on the outside; but as the Scriptures say, "You must remove the evil person from among you."[i]
