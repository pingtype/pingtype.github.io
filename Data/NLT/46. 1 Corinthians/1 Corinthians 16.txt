1Now about the money being collected for the Christians in Jerusalem: You should follow the same procedures I gave to the churches in Galatia.  
2On every Lord's Day,[a] each of you should put aside some amount of money in relation to what you have earned and save it for this offering. Don't wait until I get there and then try to collect it all at once.  
3When I come I will write letters of recommendation for the messengers you choose to deliver your gift to Jerusalem.  
4And if it seems appropriate for me also to go along, then we can travel together.
5I am coming to visit you after I have been to Macedonia, for I am planning to travel through Macedonia.  
6It could be that I will stay awhile with you, perhaps all winter, and then you can send me on my way to the next destination.  
7This time I don't want to make just a short visit and then go right on. I want to come and stay awhile, if the Lord will let me.  
8In the meantime, I will be staying here at Ephesus until the Festival of Pentecost,  
9for there is a wide-open door for a great work here, and many people are responding. But there are many who oppose me.
10When Timothy comes, treat him with respect. He is doing the Lord's work, just as I am.  
11Don't let anyone despise him. Send him on his way with your blessings when he returns to me. I am looking forward to seeing him soon, along with the other brothers.
12Now about our brother Apollos--I urged him to join the other brothers when they visit you, but he was not willing to come right now. He will be seeing you later, when the time is right.
13Be on guard. Stand true to what you believe. Be courageous. Be strong.  
14And everything you do must be done with love.
15You know that Stephanas and his household were the first to become Christians in Greece,[b] and they are spending their lives in service to other Christians. I urge you, dear brothers and sisters,[c]  
16to respect them fully and others like them who serve with such real devotion.  
17I am so glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus have come here. They have been making up for the help you weren't here to give me.  
18They have been a wonderful encouragement to me, as they have been to you, too. You must give proper honor to all who serve so well.
19The churches here in the province of Asia[d] greet you heartily in the Lord, along with Aquila and Priscilla and all the others who gather in their home for church meetings.  
20All the brothers and sisters here have asked me to greet you for them. Greet each other in Christian love.[e]
21Here is my greeting, which I write with my own hand--PAUL.
22If anyone does not love the Lord, that person is cursed. Our Lord, come![f]
23May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
24My love to all of you in Christ Jesus.[g]
