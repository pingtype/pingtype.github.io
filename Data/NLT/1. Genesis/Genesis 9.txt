1God blessed Noah and his sons and told them, "Multiply and fill the earth.  2All the wild animals, large and small, and all the birds and fish will be afraid of you. I have placed them in your power.  3I have given them to you for food, just as I have given you grain and vegetables.  4But you must never eat animals that still have their lifeblood in them.  5And murder is forbidden. Animals that kill people must die, and any person who murders must be killed.  6Yes, you must execute anyone who murders another person, for to kill a person is to kill a living being made in God's image.  7Now you must have many children and repopulate the earth. Yes, multiply and fill the earth!"8Then God told Noah and his sons,  9"I am making a covenant with you and your descendants,  10and with the animals you brought with you--all these birds and livestock and wild animals.  11I solemnly promise never to send another flood to kill all living creatures and destroy the earth."  12And God said, "I am giving you a sign as evidence of my eternal covenant with you and all living creatures.  13I have placed my rainbow in the clouds. It is the sign of my permanent promise to you and to all the earth.  14When I send clouds over the earth, the rainbow will be seen in the clouds,  15and I will remember my covenant with you and with everything that lives. Never again will there be a flood that will destroy all life.  16When I see the rainbow in the clouds, I will remember the eternal covenant between God and every living creature on earth."  17Then God said to Noah, "Yes, this is the sign of my covenant with all the creatures of the earth."18Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the three sons of Noah, survived the Flood with their father. (Ham is the ancestor of the Canaanites.)  19From these three sons of Noah came all the people now scattered across the earth.20After the Flood, Noah became a farmer and planted a vineyard.  21One day he became drunk on some wine he had made and lay naked in his tent.  22Ham, the father of Canaan, saw that his father was naked and went outside and told his brothers.  23Shem and Japheth took a robe, held it over their shoulders, walked backward into the tent, and covered their father's naked body. As they did this, they looked the other way so they wouldn't see him naked.  24When Noah woke up from his drunken stupor, he learned what Ham, his youngest son, had done.  25Then he cursed the descendants of Canaan, the son of Ham: "A curse on the Canaanites! May they be the lowest of servants to the descendants of Shem and Japheth."26Then Noah said, "May Shem be blessed by the LORD my God; and may Canaan be his servant.27 May God enlarge the territory of Japheth, and may he share the prosperity of Shem;[a] and let Canaan be his servant."28Noah lived another 350 years after the Flood.  29He was 950 years old when he died.
