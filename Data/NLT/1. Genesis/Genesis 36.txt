1This is the history of the descendants of Esau (also known as Edom).  2Esau married two young women from Canaan: Adah, the daughter of Elon the Hittite; and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite.  3He also married his cousin Basemath, who was the daughter of Ishmael and the sister of Nebaioth.  4Esau and Adah had a son named Eliphaz. Esau and Basemath had a son named Reuel.  5Esau and Oholibamah had sons named Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. All these sons were born to Esau in the land of Canaan.6Then Esau took his wives, children, household servants, cattle, and flocks--all the wealth he had gained in the land of Canaan--and moved away from his brother, Jacob.  7There was not enough land to support them both because of all their cattle and livestock.  8So Esau (also known as Edom) settled in the hill country of Seir.9This is a list of Esau's descendants, the Edomites, who lived in the hill country of Seir.10Among Esau's sons were Eliphaz, the son of Esau's wife Adah; and Reuel, the son of Esau's wife Basemath.11The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.  12Eliphaz had another son named Amalek, born to Timna, his concubine. These were all grandchildren of Esau's wife Adah.13The sons of Reuel were Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were all grandchildren of Esau's wife Basemath.14Esau also had sons through Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon. Their names were Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.15Esau's children and grandchildren became the leaders of different clans. The sons of Esau's oldest son, Eliphaz, became the leaders of the clans of Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz, 16Korah, Gatam, and Amalek. These clans in the land of Edom were descended from Eliphaz, the son of Esau and Adah.17The sons of Esau's son Reuel became the leaders of the clans of Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These clans in the land of Edom were descended from Reuel, the son of Esau and Basemath.18The sons of Esau and his wife Oholibamah became the leaders of the clans of Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the clans descended from Esau's wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah.19These are all the clans descended from Esau (also known as Edom).20These are the names of the tribes that descended from Seir the Horite, one of the families native to the land of Seir: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,  21Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These were the Horite clans, the descendants of Seir, who lived in the land of Edom.22The sons of Lotan were Hori and Heman. Lotan's sister was named Timna.23The sons of Shobal were Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.24The sons of Zibeon were Aiah and Anah. This is the Anah who discovered the hot springs in the wilderness while he was grazing his father's donkeys.25The son of Anah was Dishon, and Oholibamah was his daughter.26The sons of Dishon[a] were Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Keran.27The sons of Ezer were Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.28The sons of Dishan were Uz and Aran.29So the leaders of the Horite clans were Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,  30Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. The Horite clans are named after their clan leaders, who lived in the land of Seir.31These are the kings who ruled in Edom before there were kings in Israel[b]:32Bela son of Beor, who ruled from his city of Dinhabah.33When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah became king.34When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites became king.35When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad became king and ruled from the city of Avith. He was the one who destroyed the Midianite army in the land of Moab.36When Hadad died, Samlah from the city of Masrekah became king.37When Samlah died, Shaul from the city of Rehoboth on the Euphrates River[c] became king.38When Shaul died, Baal-hanan son of Acbor became king.39When Baal-hanan died, Hadad[d] became king and ruled from the city of Pau. Hadad's wife was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred and granddaughter of Me-zahab.40These are the leaders of the clans of Esau, who lived in the places named for them: Timna, Alvah, Jetheth,  41Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon,  42Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,  43Magdiel, and Iram. These are the names of the clans of Esau, the ancestor of the Edomites, each clan giving its name to the area it occupied.
