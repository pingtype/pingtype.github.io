1When the human population began to grow rapidly on the earth,  2the sons of God saw the beautiful women of the human race and took any they wanted as their wives.  3Then the LORD said, "My Spirit will not put up with humans for such a long time, for they are only mortal flesh. In the future, they will live no more than 120 years."4In those days, and even afterward, giants[a] lived on the earth, for whenever the sons of God had intercourse with human women, they gave birth to children who became the heroes mentioned in legends of old.5Now the LORD observed the extent of the people's wickedness, and he saw that all their thoughts were consistently and totally evil.  6So the LORD was sorry he had ever made them. It broke his heart.  7And the LORD said, "I will completely wipe out this human race that I have created. Yes, and I will destroy all the animals and birds, too. I am sorry I ever made them."  8But Noah found favor with the LORD.9This is the history of Noah and his family. Noah was a righteous man, the only blameless man living on earth at the time. He consistently followed God's will and enjoyed a close relationship with him.  10Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.11Now the earth had become corrupt in God's sight, and it was filled with violence.  12God observed all this corruption in the world, and he saw violence and depravity everywhere.  13So God said to Noah, "I have decided to destroy all living creatures, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. Yes, I will wipe them all from the face of the earth!14"Make a boat[b] from resinous wood and seal it with tar, inside and out. Then construct decks and stalls throughout its interior.  15Make it 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high.[c]  16Construct an opening all the way around the boat, 18 inches[d] below the roof. Then put three decks inside the boat--bottom, middle, and upper--and put a door in the side.17"Look! I am about to cover the earth with a flood that will destroy every living thing. Everything on earth will die!  18But I solemnly swear to keep you safe in the boat, with your wife and your sons and their wives. 19Bring a pair of every kind of animal--a male and a female--into the boat with you to keep them alive during the flood.  20Pairs of each kind of bird and each kind of animal, large and small alike, will come to you to be kept alive.  21And remember, take enough food for your family and for all the animals."22So Noah did everything exactly as God had commanded him.
