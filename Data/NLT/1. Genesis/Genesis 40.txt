1Some time later, Pharaoh's chief cup-bearer and chief baker offended him.  2Pharaoh became very angry with these officials,  3and he put them in the prison where Joseph was, in the palace of Potiphar, the captain of the guard.  4They remained in prison for quite some time, and Potiphar assigned Joseph to take care of them.5One night the cup-bearer and the baker each had a dream, and each dream had its own meaning.  6The next morning Joseph noticed the dejected look on their faces.  7"Why do you look so worried today?" he asked.8And they replied, "We both had dreams last night, but there is no one here to tell us what they mean." "Interpreting dreams is God's business," Joseph replied. "Tell me what you saw."9The cup-bearer told his dream first. "In my dream," he said, "I saw a vine in front of me.  10It had three branches that began to bud and blossom, and soon there were clusters of ripe grapes.  11I was holding Pharaoh's wine cup in my hand, so I took the grapes and squeezed the juice into it. Then I placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand."12"I know what the dream means," Joseph said. "The three branches mean three days.  13Within three days Pharaoh will take you out of prison and return you to your position as his chief cup-bearer.  14And please have some pity on me when you are back in his favor. Mention me to Pharaoh, and ask him to let me out of here.  15For I was kidnapped from my homeland, the land of the Hebrews, and now I'm here in jail, but I did nothing to deserve it."16When the chief baker saw that the first dream had such a good meaning, he told his dream to Joseph, too. "In my dream," he said, "there were three baskets of pastries on my head.  17In the top basket were all kinds of bakery goods for Pharaoh, but the birds came and ate them."18"I'll tell you what it means," Joseph told him. "The three baskets mean three days.  19Three days from now Pharaoh will cut off your head and impale your body on a pole. Then birds will come and peck away at your flesh."20Pharaoh's birthday came three days later, and he gave a banquet for all his officials and household staff. He sent for his chief cup-bearer and chief baker, and they were brought to him from the prison.  21He then restored the chief cup-bearer to his former position,  22but he sentenced the chief baker to be impaled on a pole, just as Joseph had predicted.  23Pharaoh's cup-bearer, however, promptly forgot all about Joseph, never giving him another thought.
