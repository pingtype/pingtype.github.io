1Now Abraham married again. Keturah was his new wife,  2and she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.  3Jokshan's two sons were Sheba and Dedan. Dedan's descendants were the Asshurites, Letushites, and Leummites.  4Midian's sons were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. These were all descendants of Abraham through Keturah.5Abraham left everything he owned to his son Isaac.  6But before he died, he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them off to the east, away from Isaac.7Abraham lived for 175 years,  8and he died at a ripe old age, joining his ancestors in death.  9His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite.  10This was the field Abraham had purchased from the Hittites, where he had buried his wife Sarah. 11After Abraham's death, God poured out rich blessings on Isaac, who settled near Beer-lahairoi in the Negev.12This is the history of the descendants of Ishmael, the son of Abraham through Hagar, Sarah's Egyptian servant.  13Here is a list, by their names and clans, of Ishmael's descendants: The oldest was Nebaioth, followed by Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,  14Mishma, Dumah, Massa,  15Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.  16These twelve sons of Ishmael became the founders of twelve tribes that bore their names, listed according to the places they settled and camped.  17Ishmael finally died at the age of 137 and joined his ancestors in death.  18Ishmael's descendants were scattered across the country from Havilah to Shur, which is east of Egypt in the direction of Asshur. The clans descended from Ishmael camped close to one another.[a]19This is the history of the family of Isaac, the son of Abraham.  20When Isaac was forty years old, he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan-aram and the sister of Laban.  21Isaac pleaded with the LORD to give Rebekah a child because she was childless. So the LORD answered Isaac's prayer, and his wife became pregnant with twins.  22But the two children struggled with each other in her womb. So she went to ask the LORD about it. "Why is this happening to me?" she asked.23And the LORD told her, "The sons in your womb will become two rival nations. One nation will be stronger than the other; the descendants of your older son will serve the descendants of your younger son."24And when the time came, the twins were born.  25The first was very red at birth. He was covered with so much hair that one would think he was wearing a piece of clothing. So they called him Esau.[b]  26Then the other twin was born with his hand grasping Esau's heel. So they called him Jacob.[c] Isaac was sixty years old when the twins were born.27As the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open fields, while Jacob was the kind of person who liked to stay at home.  28Isaac loved Esau in particular because of the wild game he brought home, but Rebekah favored Jacob.29One day when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau arrived home exhausted and hungry from a hunt. 30Esau said to Jacob, "I'm starved! Give me some of that red stew you've made." (This was how Esau got his other name, Edom--"Red.")31Jacob replied, "All right, but trade me your birthright for it."32"Look, I'm dying of starvation!" said Esau. "What good is my birthright to me now?"33So Jacob insisted, "Well then, swear to me right now that it is mine." So Esau swore an oath, thereby selling all his rights as the firstborn to his younger brother.  34Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and lentil stew. Esau ate and drank and went on about his business, indifferent to the fact that he had given up his birthright.
