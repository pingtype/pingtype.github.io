1Then I looked up again and saw four chariots coming from between two bronze mountains.  2The first chariot was pulled by red horses, the second by black horses,  3the third by white horses, and the fourth by dappled-gray horses.  4"And what are these, my lord?" I asked the angel who was talking with me.5He replied, "These are the four spirits[a] of heaven who stand before the Lord of all the earth. They are going out to do his work.  6The chariot with black horses is going north, the chariot with white horses is going west,[b] and the chariot with dappled-gray horses is going south."7The powerful horses were eager to be off, to patrol back and forth across the earth. And the LORD said, "Go and patrol the earth!" So they left at once on their patrol.8Then the LORD summoned me and said, "Those who went north have vented the anger of my Spirit[c] there."9Then I received another message from the LORD:  10"Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah will bring gifts of silver and gold from the Jews exiled in Babylon. As soon as they arrive, meet them at the home of Josiah son of Zephaniah.  11Accept their gifts and make a crown[d] from the silver and gold. Then put the crown on the head of Jeshua[e] son of Jehozadak, the high priest.  12Tell him that the LORD Almighty says: Here is the man called the Branch. He will branch out where he is and build the Temple of the LORD.  13He will build the LORD's Temple, and he will receive royal honor and will rule as king from his throne. He will also serve as priest from his throne,[f] and there will be perfect harmony between the two.14"The crown will be a memorial in the Temple of the LORD to honor those who gave it--Heldai,[g] Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Josiah[h] son of Zephaniah."15Many will come from distant lands to rebuild the Temple of the LORD. And when this happens, you will know my messages have been from the LORD Almighty. All this will happen if you carefully obey the commands of the LORD your God.
