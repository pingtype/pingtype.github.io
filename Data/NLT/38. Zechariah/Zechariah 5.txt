1I looked up again and saw a scroll flying through the air.2"What do you see?" the angel asked. "I see a flying scroll," I replied. "It appears to be about thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide.[a]"3Then he said to me, "This scroll contains the curse that is going out over the entire land. One side says that those who steal will be banished from the land; the other side says that those who swear falsely will be banished from the land.  4And this is what the LORD Almighty says: I am sending this curse into the house of every thief and into the house of everyone who swears falsely by my name. And my curse will remain in that house until it is completely destroyed--even its timbers and stones."5Then the angel who was talking with me came forward and said, "Look up! Something is appearing in the sky."6"What is it?" I asked. He replied, "It is a basket for measuring grain,[b] and it is filled with the sins[c] of everyone throughout the land."7When the heavy lead cover was lifted off the basket, there was a woman sitting inside it.  8The angel said, "The woman's name is Wickedness," and he pushed her back into the basket and closed the heavy lid again.9Then I looked up and saw two women flying toward us, with wings gliding on the wind. Their wings were like those of a stork, and they picked up the basket and flew with it into the sky.10"Where are they taking the basket?" I asked the angel.11He replied, "To the land of Babylonia,[d] where they will build a temple for the basket. And when the temple is ready, they will set the basket there on its pedestal."
