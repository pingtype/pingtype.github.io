1Then the angel showed me Jeshua[a] the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD. Satan[b] was there at the angel's right hand, accusing Jeshua of many things.  2And the LORD said to Satan, "I, the LORD, reject your accusations, Satan. Yes, the LORD, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebukes you. This man is like a burning stick that has been snatched from a fire."3Jeshua's clothing was filthy as he stood there before the angel.  4So the angel said to the others standing there, "Take off his filthy clothes." And turning to Jeshua he said, "See, I have taken away your sins, and now I am giving you these fine new clothes."5Then I said, "Please, could he also have a clean turban on his head?" So they put a clean priestly turban on his head and dressed him in new clothes while the angel of the LORD stood by.6Then the angel of the LORD spoke very solemnly to Jeshua and said,  7"This is what the LORD Almighty says: If you follow my ways and obey my requirements, then you will be given authority over my Temple and its courtyards. I will let you walk in and out of my presence along with these others standing here.  8Listen to me, O Jeshua the high priest, and all you other priests. You are symbols of the good things to come. Soon I am going to bring my servant, the Branch.  9Now look at the jewel I have set before Jeshua, a single stone with seven facets.[c] I will engrave an inscription on it, says the LORD Almighty, and I will remove the sins of this land in a single day.  10And on that day, says the LORD Almighty, each of you will invite your neighbor into your home to share your peace and prosperity."
