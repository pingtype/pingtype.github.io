1 This message from the LORD was delivered to King Baasha by the prophet Jehu son of Hanani:  2"I lifted you out of the dust to make you ruler of my people Israel, but you have followed the evil example of Jeroboam. You have aroused my anger by causing my people to sin.  3So now I will destroy you and your family, just as I destroyed the descendants of Jeroboam son of Nebat.  4Those of your family who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and those who die in the field will be eaten by the vultures."5The rest of the events in Baasha's reign and the extent of his power are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.  6When Baasha died, he was buried in Tirzah. Then his son Elah became the next king.7This message from the LORD had been spoken against Baasha and his family through the prophet Jehu son of Hanani. It was delivered because Baasha had done what was evil in the LORD's sight, arousing him to anger by his sins, just like the family of Jeroboam, and also because Baasha had destroyed the family of Jeroboam.8Elah son of Baasha began to rule over Israel from Tirzah in the twenty-sixth year of King Asa's reign in Judah. He reigned in Israel two years.  9Then Zimri, who commanded half of the royal chariots, made plans to kill him. One day in Tirzah, Elah was getting drunk at the home of Arza, the supervisor of the palace. 10Zimri walked in and struck him down and killed him. This happened in the twenty-seventh year of King Asa's reign in Judah. Then Zimri became the next king.11Zimri immediately killed the entire royal family of Baasha, and he did not leave a single male child. He even destroyed distant relatives and friends.  12So Zimri destroyed the dynasty of Baasha as the LORD had promised through the prophet Jehu.  13This happened because of the sins of Baasha and his son Elah and because of all the sins they led Israel to commit, arousing the anger of the LORD, the God of Israel, with their idols.  14The rest of the events in Elah's reign and all his deeds are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.15Zimri began to rule over Israel from Tirzah in the twenty-seventh year of King Asa's reign in Judah, but he reigned only seven days. When the army of Israel, which was then engaged in attacking the Philistine town of Gibbethon,  16heard that Zimri had assassinated the king, they chose Omri, commander of the army, as their new king.  17So Omri led the army of Israel away from Gibbethon to attack Tirzah, Israel's capital.  18When Zimri saw that the city had been taken, he went into the citadel of the king's house and burned it down over himself and died in the flames.  19For he, too, had done what was evil in the LORD's sight and followed the example of Jeroboam, continuing the sins of idolatry that Jeroboam had led Israel to commit.  20The rest of the events of Zimri's reign and his conspiracy are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.21But now the people of Israel were divided into two groups. Half the people tried to make Tibni son of Ginath their king, while the other half supported Omri.  22But Omri's supporters defeated the supporters of Tibni son of Ginath. So Tibni was killed, and Omri became the next king.23Omri began to rule over Israel in the thirty-first year of King Asa's reign in Judah. He reigned twelve years in all, six of them in Tirzah.  24Then Omri bought the hill now known as Samaria from its owner, Shemer, for 150 pounds of silver.[a] He built a city on it and called the city Samaria in honor of Shemer. 25But Omri did what was evil in the LORD's sight, even more than any of the kings before him.  26He followed the example of Jeroboam, continuing the sins of idolatry that Jeroboam had led Israel to commit. Thus, he aroused the anger of the LORD, the God of Israel.  27The rest of the events in Omri's reign, the extent of his power, and all his deeds are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.  28When Omri died, he was buried in Samaria. Then his son Ahab became the next king.29Ahab son of Omri began to rule over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of King Asa's reign in Judah. He reigned in Samaria twenty-two years.  30But Ahab did what was evil in the LORD's sight, even more than any of the kings before him.  31And as though it were not enough to live like Jeroboam, he married Jezebel, the daughter of King Ethbaal of the Sidonians, and he began to worship Baal.  32First he built a temple and an altar for Baal in Samaria.  33Then he set up an Asherah pole. He did more to arouse the anger of the LORD, the God of Israel, than any of the other kings of Israel before him.34It was during his reign that Hiel, a man from Bethel, rebuilt Jericho. When he laid the foundations, his oldest son, Abiram, died. And when he finally completed it by setting up the gates, his youngest son, Segub, died. This all happened according to the message from the LORD concerning Jericho spoken by Joshua son of Nun.
