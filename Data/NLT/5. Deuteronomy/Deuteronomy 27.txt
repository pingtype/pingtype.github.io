1Then Moses and the leaders of Israel charged the people as follows: "Keep all these commands that I am giving you today.  2When you cross the Jordan River and enter the land the LORD your God is giving you, set up some large stones and coat them with plaster.  3Then write all the terms of this law on them. I repeat, you will soon cross the river to enter the land the LORD your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the LORD, the God of your ancestors, promised you.  4When you cross the Jordan, set up these stones at Mount Ebal and coat them with plaster, as I am commanding you today.  5Then build an altar there to the LORD your God, using natural stones.  6Do not shape the stones with an iron tool. On the altar you must offer burnt offerings to the LORD your God.  7Sacrifice peace offerings on it also, and feast there with great joy before the LORD your God.  8On the stones coated with plaster, you must clearly write all the terms of this law."9Then Moses and the Levitical priests addressed all Israel as follows: "O Israel, be quiet and listen! Today you have become the people of the LORD your God.  10So obey the LORD your God by keeping all these commands and laws that I am giving you today."11That same day Moses gave this charge to the people:  12"When you cross the Jordan River, the tribes of Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin must stand on Mount Gerizim to proclaim a blessing over the people.  13And the tribes of Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali must stand on Mount Ebal to proclaim a curse.  14Then the Levites must shout to all the people of Israel:15`Cursed is anyone who carves or casts idols and secretly sets them up. These idols, the work of craftsmen, are detestable to the LORD.' And all the people will reply, `Amen.'16`Cursed is anyone who despises father or mother.' And all the people will reply, `Amen.'17`Cursed is anyone who steals property from a neighbor by moving a boundary marker.' And all the people will reply, `Amen.'18`Cursed is anyone who leads a blind person astray on the road.' And all the people will reply, `Amen.'19`Cursed is anyone who is unjust to foreigners, orphans, and widows.' And all the people will reply, `Amen.'20`Cursed is anyone who has sexual intercourse with his father's wife, for he has violated his father.' And all the people will reply, `Amen.'21`Cursed is anyone who has sexual intercourse with an animal.' And all the people will reply, `Amen.'22`Cursed is anyone who has sexual intercourse with his sister, whether she is the daughter of his father or his mother.' And all the people will reply, `Amen.'23`Cursed is anyone who has sexual intercourse with his mother-in-law.' And all the people will reply, `Amen.'24`Cursed is anyone who kills another person in secret.' And all the people will reply, `Amen.'25`Cursed is anyone who accepts payment to kill an innocent person.' And all the people will reply, `Amen.'26`Cursed is anyone who does not affirm the terms of this law by obeying them.' And all the people will reply, `Amen.'
