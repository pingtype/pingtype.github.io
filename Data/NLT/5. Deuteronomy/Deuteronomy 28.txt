1"If you fully obey the LORD your God by keeping all the commands I am giving you today, the LORD your God will exalt you above all the nations of the world.  2You will experience all these blessings if you obey the LORD your God:3 You will be blessed in your towns and in the country.4 You will be blessed with many children and productive fields. You will be blessed with fertile herds and flocks.5 You will be blessed with baskets overflowing with fruit, and with kneading bowls filled with bread.6 You will be blessed wherever you go, both in coming and in going.7"The LORD will conquer your enemies when they attack you. They will attack you from one direction, but they will scatter from you in seven!8"The LORD will bless everything you do and will fill your storehouses with grain. The LORD your God will bless you in the land he is giving you.9"If you obey the commands of the LORD your God and walk in his ways, the LORD will establish you as his holy people as he solemnly promised to do.  10Then all the nations of the world will see that you are a people claimed by the LORD, and they will stand in awe of you.11"The LORD will give you an abundance of good things in the land he swore to give your ancestors--many children, numerous livestock, and abundant crops.  12The LORD will send rain at the proper time from his rich treasury in the heavens to bless all the work you do. You will lend to many nations, but you will never need to borrow from them.  13If you listen to these commands of the LORD your God and carefully obey them, the LORD will make you the head and not the tail, and you will always have the upper hand.  14You must not turn away from any of the commands I am giving you today to follow after other gods and worship them.15"But if you refuse to listen to the LORD your God and do not obey all the commands and laws I am giving you today, all these curses will come and overwhelm you:16 You will be cursed in your towns and in the country.17 You will be cursed with baskets empty of fruit, and with kneading bowls empty of bread.18 You will be cursed with few children and barren fields. You will be cursed with infertile herds and flocks.19 You will be cursed wherever you go, both in coming and in going.20"The LORD himself will send against you curses, confusion, and disillusionment in everything you do, until at last you are completely destroyed for doing evil and forsaking me.  21The LORD will send diseases among you until none of you are left in the land you are about to enter and occupy.  22The LORD will strike you with wasting disease, fever, and inflammation, with scorching heat and drought, and with blight and mildew. These devastations will pursue you until you die.  23The skies above will be as unyielding as bronze, and the earth beneath will be as hard as iron.  24The LORD will turn your rain into sand and dust, and it will pour down from the sky until you are destroyed.25"The LORD will cause you to be defeated by your enemies. You will attack your enemies from one direction, but you will scatter from them in seven! You will be an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.  26Your dead bodies will be food for the birds and wild animals, and no one will be there to chase them away.27"The LORD will afflict you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors, scurvy, and the itch, from which you cannot be cured.  28The LORD will strike you with madness, blindness, and panic.  29You will grope around in broad daylight, just like a blind person groping in the darkness, and you will not succeed at anything you do. You will be oppressed and robbed continually, and no one will come to save you.30"You will be engaged to a woman, but another man will ravish her. You will build a house, but someone else will live in it. You will plant a vineyard, but you will never enjoy its fruit.  31Your ox will be butchered before your eyes, but you won't get a single bite of the meat. Your donkey will be driven away, never to be returned. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and no one will be there to help you.  32You will watch as your sons and daughters are taken away as slaves. Your heart will break as you long for them, but nothing you do will help.  33A foreign nation you have never heard about will eat the crops you worked so hard to grow. You will suffer under constant oppression and harsh treatment.  34You will go mad because of all the tragedy around you.  35The LORD will cover you from head to foot with incurable boils.36"The LORD will exile you and the king you crowned to a nation unknown to you and your ancestors. Then in exile you will worship gods of wood and stone!  37You will become an object of horror, a proverb and a mockery among all the nations to which the LORD sends you.38"You will plant much but harvest little, for locusts will eat your crops.  39You will plant vineyards and care for them, but you will not drink the wine or eat the grapes, for worms will destroy the vines.  40You will grow olive trees throughout your land, but you will never use the olive oil, for the trees will drop the fruit before it is ripe.  41You will have sons and daughters, but you will not keep them, for they will be led away into captivity.  42Swarms of insects will destroy your trees and crops.  43The foreigners living among you will become stronger and stronger, while you become weaker and weaker.  44They will lend money to you, not you to them. They will be the head, and you will be the tail!45"If you refuse to listen to the LORD your God and to obey the commands and laws he has given you, all these curses will pursue and overtake you until you are destroyed.  46These horrors will serve as a sign and warning among you and your descendants forever.  47Because you have not served the LORD your God with joy and enthusiasm for the abundant benefits you have received,  48you will serve your enemies whom the LORD will send against you. You will be left hungry, thirsty, naked, and lacking in everything. They will oppress you harshly until you are destroyed.49"The LORD will bring a distant nation against you from the end of the earth, and it will swoop down on you like an eagle. It is a nation whose language you do not understand,  50a fierce and heartless nation that shows no respect for the old and no pity for the young.  51Its armies will devour your livestock and crops, and you will starve to death. They will leave you no grain, new wine, olive oil, calves, or lambs, bringing about your destruction.  52They will lay siege to your cities until all the fortified walls in your land--the walls you trusted to protect you--are knocked down. They will attack all the towns in the land the LORD your God has given you.  53The siege will be so severe that you will eat the flesh of your own sons and daughters, whom the LORD your God has given you.  54The most tenderhearted man among you will have no compassion for his own brother, his beloved wife, and his surviving children.  55He will refuse to give them a share of the flesh he is devouring--the flesh of one of his own children--because he has nothing else to eat during the siege that your enemy will inflict on all your towns.  56The most tender and delicate woman among you--so delicate she would not so much as touch her feet to the ground--will be cruel to the husband she loves and to her own son or daughter.  57She will hide from them the afterbirth and the new baby she has borne, so that she herself can secretly eat them. She will have nothing else to eat during the siege and terrible distress that your enemy will inflict on all your towns.58"If you refuse to obey all the terms of this law that are written in this book, and if you do not fear the glorious and awesome name of the LORD your God,  59then the LORD will overwhelm both you and your children with indescribable plagues. These plagues will be intense and without relief, making you miserable and unbearably sick.  60He will bring against you all the diseases of Egypt that you feared so much, and they will claim you.  61The LORD will bring against you every sickness and plague there is, even those not mentioned in this Book of the Law, until you are destroyed.  62Though you are as numerous as the stars in the sky, few of you will be left because you would not listen to the LORD your God.63"Just as the LORD has found great pleasure in helping you to prosper and multiply, the LORD will find pleasure in destroying you, until you disappear from the land you are about to enter and occupy.  64For the LORD will scatter you among all the nations from one end of the earth to the other. There you will worship foreign gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known, gods made of wood and stone!  65There among those nations you will find no place of security and rest. And the LORD will cause your heart to tremble, your eyesight to fail, and your soul to despair.  66Your lives will hang in doubt. You will live night and day in fear, with no reason to believe that you will see the morning light.  67In the morning you will say, `If only it were night!' And in the evening you will say, `If only it were morning!' You will say this because of your terror at the awesome horrors you see around you.  68Then the LORD will send you back to Egypt in ships, a journey I promised you would never again make. There you will offer to sell yourselves to your enemies as slaves, but no one will want to buy you."
