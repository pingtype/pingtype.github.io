1One day the widow of one of Elisha's fellow prophets came to Elisha and cried out to him, "My husband who served you is dead, and you know how he feared the LORD. But now a creditor has come, threatening to take my two sons as slaves."2"What can I do to help you?" Elisha asked. "Tell me, what do you have in the house?" "Nothing at all, except a flask of olive oil," she replied.3And Elisha said, "Borrow as many empty jars as you can from your friends and neighbors.  4Then go into your house with your sons and shut the door behind you. Pour olive oil from your flask into the jars, setting the jars aside as they are filled."5So she did as she was told. Her sons brought many jars to her, and she filled one after another.  6Soon every container was full to the brim! "Bring me another jar," she said to one of her sons. "There aren't any more!" he told her. And then the olive oil stopped flowing.7When she told the man of God what had happened, he said to her, "Now sell the olive oil and pay your debts, and there will be enough money left over to support you and your sons."8One day Elisha went to the town of Shunem. A wealthy woman lived there, and she invited him to eat some food. From then on, whenever he passed that way, he would stop there to eat.9She said to her husband, "I am sure this man who stops in from time to time is a holy man of God. 10Let's make a little room for him on the roof and furnish it with a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp. Then he will have a place to stay whenever he comes by."11One day Elisha returned to Shunem, and he went up to his room to rest.  12He said to his servant Gehazi, "Tell the woman I want to speak to her." When she arrived,  13Elisha said to Gehazi, "Tell her that we appreciate the kind concern she has shown us. Now ask her what we can do for her. Does she want me to put in a good word for her to the king or to the commander of the army?" "No," she replied, "my family takes good care of me."14Later Elisha asked Gehazi, "What do you think we can do for her?" He suggested, "She doesn't have a son, and her husband is an old man."15"Call her back again," Elisha told him. When the woman returned, Elisha said to her as she stood in the doorway,  16"Next year at about this time you will be holding a son in your arms!" "No, my lord!" she protested. "Please don't lie to me like that, O man of God."  17But sure enough, the woman soon became pregnant. And at that time the following year she had a son, just as Elisha had said.18One day when her child was older, he went out to visit his father, who was working with the harvesters. 19Suddenly he complained, "My head hurts! My head hurts!" His father said to one of the servants, "Carry him home to his mother."20So the servant took him home, and his mother held him on her lap. But around noontime he died. 21She carried him up to the bed of the man of God, then shut the door and left him there.  22She sent a message to her husband: "Send one of the servants and a donkey so that I can hurry to the man of God and come right back."23"Why today?" he asked. "It is neither a new moon festival nor a Sabbath." But she said, "It's all right."  24So she saddled the donkey and said to the servant, "Hurry! Don't slow down on my account unless I tell you to."25As she approached the man of God at Mount Carmel, Elisha saw her in the distance. He said to Gehazi, "Look, the woman from Shunem is coming.  26Run out to meet her and ask her, `Is everything all right with you, with your husband, and with your child?' " "Yes," the woman told Gehazi, "everything is fine."27But when she came to the man of God at the mountain, she fell to the ground before him and caught hold of his feet. Gehazi began to push her away, but the man of God said, "Leave her alone. Something is troubling her deeply, and the LORD has not told me what it is."28Then she said, "It was you, my lord, who said I would have a son. And didn't I tell you not to raise my hopes?"29Then Elisha said to Gehazi, "Get ready to travel; take my staff and go! Don't talk to anyone along the way. Go quickly and lay the staff on the child's face."30But the boy's mother said, "As surely as the LORD lives and you yourself live, I won't go home unless you go with me." So Elisha returned with her.31Gehazi hurried on ahead and laid the staff on the child's face, but nothing happened. There was no sign of life. He returned to meet Elisha and told him, "The child is still dead."32When Elisha arrived, the child was indeed dead, lying there on the prophet's bed.  33He went in alone and shut the door behind him and prayed to the LORD.  34Then he lay down on the child's body, placing his mouth on the child's mouth, his eyes on the child's eyes, and his hands on the child's hands. And the child's body began to grow warm again!  35Elisha got up and walked back and forth in the room a few times. Then he stretched himself out again on the child. This time the boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes!36Then Elisha summoned Gehazi. "Call the child's mother!" he said. And when she came in, Elisha said, "Here, take your son!"  37She fell at his feet, overwhelmed with gratitude. Then she picked up her son and carried him downstairs.38Elisha now returned to Gilgal, but there was a famine in the land. One day as the group of prophets was seated before him, he said to his servant, "Put on a large kettle and make some stew for these men."39One of the young men went out into the field to gather vegetables and came back with a pocketful of wild gourds. He shredded them and put them into the kettle without realizing they were poisonous.  40But after the men had eaten a bite or two they cried out, "Man of God, there's poison in this stew!" So they would not eat it.41Elisha said, "Bring me some flour." Then he threw it into the kettle and said, "Now it's all right; go ahead and eat." And then it did not harm them!42One day a man from Baal-shalishah brought the man of God a sack of fresh grain and twenty loaves of barley bread made from the first grain of his harvest. Elisha said, "Give it to the group of prophets[a] so they can eat."43"What?" his servant exclaimed. "Feed one hundred people with only this?" But Elisha repeated, "Give it to the group of prophets so they can eat, for the LORD says there will be plenty for all. There will even be some left over!"  44And sure enough, there was plenty for all and some left over, just as the LORD had promised.
