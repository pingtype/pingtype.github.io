1Uzziah[a] son of Amaziah began to rule over Judah in the twenty-seventh year of the reign of King Jeroboam II of Israel.  2He was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. His mother was Jecoliah, from Jerusalem.  3He did what was pleasing in the LORD's sight, just as his father, Amaziah, had done.  4But he did not destroy the pagan shrines, where the people offered sacrifices and burned incense.  5The LORD struck the king with leprosy,[b] which lasted until the day of his death; he lived in a house by himself. The king's son Jotham was put in charge of the royal palace, and he governed the people of the land.6The rest of the events in Uzziah's reign and all his deeds are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Judah.  7When Uzziah died, he was buried near his ancestors in the City of David. Then his son Jotham became the next king.8Zechariah son of Jeroboam II began to rule over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of King Uzziah's reign in Judah. He reigned in Samaria six months.  9Zechariah did what was evil in the LORD's sight, as his ancestors had done. He refused to turn from the sins of idolatry that Jeroboam son of Nebat had led Israel to commit. 10Then Shallum son of Jabesh conspired against Zechariah, assassinated him in public,[c] and became the next king.  11The rest of the events in Zechariah's reign are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.  12So the LORD's message to Jehu came true: "Your descendants will be kings of Israel down to the fourth generation."13Shallum son of Jabesh began to rule over Israel in the thirty-ninth year of King Uzziah's reign in Judah. Shallum reigned in Samaria only one month.  14Then Menahem son of Gadi went to Samaria from Tirzah and assassinated him, and he became the next king.  15The rest of the events in Shallum's reign, including his conspiracy, are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.16At that time Menahem destroyed the town of Tappuah[d] and all the surrounding countryside as far as Tirzah, because its citizens refused to surrender the town. He killed the entire population and ripped open the pregnant women.17Menahem son of Gadi began to rule over Israel in the thirty-ninth year of King Uzziah's reign in Judah. He reigned in Samaria ten years.  18But Menahem did what was evil in the LORD's sight. During his entire reign, he refused to turn from the sins of idolatry that Jeroboam son of Nebat had led Israel to commit. 19Then King Tiglath-pileser[e] of Assyria invaded the land. But Menahem paid him thirty-seven tons[f] of silver to gain his support in tightening his grip on royal power.  20Menahem extorted the money from the rich of Israel, demanding that each of them pay twenty ounces[g] of silver in the form of a special tax. So the king of Assyria turned from attacking Israel and did not stay in the land.  21The rest of the events in Menahem's reign and all his deeds are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.  22When Menahem died, his son Pekahiah became the next king.23Pekahiah son of Menahem began to rule over Israel in the fiftieth year of King Uzziah's reign in Judah. He reigned in Samaria two years.  24But Pekahiah did what was evil in the LORD's sight. He refused to turn from the sins of idolatry that Jeroboam son of Nebat had led Israel to commit.25Then Pekah son of Remaliah, the commander of Pekahiah's army, conspired against him. With fifty men from Gilead, Pekah assassinated the king, along with Argob and Arieh, in the citadel of the palace at Samaria. Pekah then became the next king of Israel.  26The rest of the events in Pekahiah's reign and all his deeds are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.27Pekah son of Remaliah began to rule over Israel in the fifty-second year of King Uzziah's reign in Judah. He reigned in Samaria twenty years.  28But Pekah did what was evil in the LORD's sight. He refused to turn from the sins of idolatry that Jeroboam son of Nebat had led Israel to commit.  29During his reign, King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria attacked Israel again, and he captured the towns of Ijon, Abel-beth-maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, and Hazor. He also conquered the regions of Gilead, Galilee, and Naphtali, and he took the people to Assyria as captives.  30Then Hoshea son of Elah conspired against Pekah and assassinated him. He began to rule over Israel in the twentieth year of Jotham son of Uzziah.  31The rest of the events in Pekah's reign and all his deeds are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.32Jotham son of Uzziah began to rule over Judah in the second year of King Pekah's reign in Israel.  33He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. His mother was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.34Jotham did what was pleasing in the LORD's sight, just as his father Uzziah had done.  35But he did not destroy the pagan shrines, where the people offered sacrifices and burned incense. He was the one who rebuilt the upper gate of the Temple of the LORD.36The rest of the events in Jotham's reign and all his deeds are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Judah.  37In those days the LORD began to send King Rezin of Aram and King Pekah of Israel to attack Judah.  38When Jotham died, he was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. Then his son Ahaz became the next king.
