Words and Music byHannah Hobbs & Aodhan KingVERSE 1:I close my eyes to seeMy King in majestyYour grace compels my soulTo love and draw in closeI lift my hands and singSurrender everythingIn You I know I’m foundMy God to You I bowCHORUS:Now until foreverJesus I surrenderShow me what I don’t knowMore of YouI’m desperate for Your presenceLonging to be with YouLead me to a new placeMore of YouPursue – Page 2VERSE 2:Through the fire I’ll persevereI won’t submit to any fearWhere I go You’ve been beforeAll my trust is in You LordBRIDGE:Lead me to YouForever Lord I will pursueI will pursueYou’ve won my heartJesus You’re all that I wantAll that I wantBRIDGE 2:Open my eyesLet me see more of Your loveMore of Your loveHere I will wait just for a glimpse of YouGodI’ll wait for You God
