Words and Music byJoel Davies, Aodhan King & LecraeVERSE 1:Waking up knowing there’s a reasonAll my dreams come aliveLife is for living with YouI’ve made my decisionVERSE 2:You lift me up, fill my eyes with wonderForever young in Your loveThis freedom’s untainted with YouNo moment is wastedPRE-CHORUS:See the sun now bursting through thecloudsBlack and white turn to colour all aroundAll is new, in the Saviour I am foundThis is living nowCHORUS:You take me higher than I’ve been beforeIt’s Your perfect love that sees me soarGod Your freedom is an open doorYou are everything I want and moreVERSE 3:You lead the way, God You’re right beside meIn Your love I’m completeThere’s nothing like living with YouThis life You created I chooseRAP:Maybe I ain't really know what living isIs it love if it was am I living it?Do I live in it?So astoundingLove is an ocean you can drown meThe sweet embrace the lovely tasteI taste and see I'm under GraceThe place to be it means I don't ever need an umbrellaI'm cool in the cold and the hot weatherWhether or never I ever understandI'm a man in the hands of great plansI stand with faith in a life I never known or touchedIt's still outside my clutch butI'm like what's to dream of and what's to hope inWhat's to die for and live to no endThis is livingThe life I've been given's a giftIf I’m gonna live it I’m gonna live it to death!So what's to dream of and what's to hope inWhat's to die for and live to no endThis is livingThe life I've been given's a giftIf I’m gonna live it I’m gonna live it to death!
