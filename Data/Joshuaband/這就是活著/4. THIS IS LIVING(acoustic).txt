Words and Music byJoel Davies & Aodhan KingVERSE 1:Waking up knowing there’s a reasonAll my dreams come aliveLife is for living with YouI’ve made my decisionVERSE 2:You lift me up, fill my eyes with wonderForever young in Your loveThis freedom’s untainted with YouNo moment is wastedPRE-CHORUS:See the sun now bursting through thecloudsBlack and white turn to colour all aroundAll is new, in the Saviour I am foundThis is living nowThis Is Living (Acoustic) – Page 2CHORUS:You take me higher than I’ve been beforeIt’s Your perfect love that sees me soarGod Your freedom is an open doorYou are everything I want and moreVERSE 3:You lead the way, God You’re right besidemeIn Your love I’m completeThere’s nothing like living with YouThis life You created I choose
