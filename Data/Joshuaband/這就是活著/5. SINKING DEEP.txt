Words and Music by Joel Davies & Aodhan KingVERSE 1:Standing here in Your presenceIn a grace so relentlessI am wonBy perfect loveWrapped within the arms of heavenIn a peace that lasts foreverSinking deepIn mercy’s seaCHORUS:I’m wide awakeDrawing closeStirred by graceAll my heart is YoursAll fear removedI breathe You inI lean into Your loveOh Your loveSinking Deep – Page 2VERSE 2:When I’m lost You pursue meLift my head to see Your gloryLord of allSo beautifulHere in You I find shelterCaptivated by the splendourOf Your faceMy secret placeBRIDGE:Your love so deepIs washing over meYour face is all I seekYou are my everythingJesus ChristYou are my one desireLord hear my only cryTo know You all my life
