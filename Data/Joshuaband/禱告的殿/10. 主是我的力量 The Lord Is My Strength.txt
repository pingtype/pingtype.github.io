縱然是無花果樹不發旺葡萄樹也不結果雖然橄欖樹不效力田地也無法收成就算是圈中無羊棚內牛群也不生養我仍然要歡欣快樂因耶和華 神是我救主祂賜給我能力使我腳快如母鹿的蹄又使我穩行在高處因主是我的力量(英)Even though the fig trees has no fruitAnd no grapes grow on the vines Even though the olive crop fails And the fields produce no cornEven though the sheep all dieAnd the cattle stalls are emptyI will still be joyful and gladBecause The Lord God is my SaviorThe Lord gives me strengthHe makes me surefooted as a deerAnd keep me safe on the mountainBecause The Lord is my strength
