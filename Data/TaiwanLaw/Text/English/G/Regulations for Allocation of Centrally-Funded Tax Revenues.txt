According to the requirements in Subparagraph 6 of Paragraph 2 under Article 16-1 of the Act, the amount allocated to each township from the general centrally-funded tax revenues should be based on the ratio, which is calculated as follows:1.The personnel expenses for formally specified staff are fifty percent (50%) of the total allocable amount.

Second, calculating the average of the final determined personnel expenses of each township for the formally specified staff in the most recent three years divided by the actual number of staff andmultiplied by the amount for formally specified staff. The amount that the first average is less than the second average is covered first.(2)The remaining amount, after the previous allocation, is further allocated based on the average of the final determined personnel expenses of each township for the formally specified staff in the most recent three years, divided by the actual number of staff and multiplied by the amount for formally specified staff, then multiplied by the ratio of the sum of previous average for all townships.2.As to the allocation for the needs of basic construction, it should be allocated as follows:(1) Thirty percent (30%) of the total allocable amount is divided evenly and allocated to each township. However, the allocated amount for each township should not exceed thirty percent (30%) of the average of the annual final determined figure in the most recent three years.(2) Ten percent (10%) of the total allocable amount is allocated based on the ratio of the population figure within the jurisdiction of each township in the most recent year to the total population figures of all townships. For the population figure in the outlying islands, a weight of two hundred percent (200%) should be added.(3) Ten percent (10%) of the total allocable amount is allocated based on the ratio of the land area within the jurisdiction of each township to the total land area of all townships. For outlying islands, a weight of two hundred percent should be added (200%).For the revenues from public manufacturing businesses that are approved to be subtracted in Item 1 of Subparagraph 1 under preceding Paragraph, when the revenues and expenses are included in official budgets, seventy percent (70%) of the revenues should be included for calculation, or when compiling a budget for subsidiary agencies, the calculation is based on the final determined figure of net earnings that contributes to the official budget.The feedback fund that has designated functions in Item 1 of Subparagraph 1 under Paragraph 1 is limited to the disbursement of personnel expenses other than the disbursement for formally specified staff, after examination and confirmation by each county government.The final determined personnel expenses for formally specified staff, aforementioned in Item 1 and Item 2 of Subparagraph 1 under Paragraph 1, is calculated separately based on whether they are office employees or labor employees.After the calculation from the formula in Paragraph 1, if the allocated amount of each township is less than the appropriated amount for each township received from the county under the original 1999 Province Collectively Allocated Tax Revenues for Taiwan Province, the allocated ratio to each township should be adjusted to cover the difference. The ratio for other townships will be consequently reduced. Article 11
