The income derived from stock transactions set forth in Paragraph 3, Article 7 of the Act with deduction of the losses derived from stock transactions in the current year performed under the provisions of the aforesaid paragraph and article, the income or losses derived from securities transactions except for stocks set forth in Article 4-1 of the Income Tax Act, and the income or losses derived from futures transactions set forth in Article 4-2 of the same Act shall be combined.2. After the calculation of the total amount of income or losses according to the previous subparagraph, if the balance is negative, then such negative amount shall be excluded from the calculation of the basic income amount and, in accordance with Paragraph 2, Article 7 of the Act, such negative amount shall be deducted from the positive balance following the calculation made in accordance with the preceding Subparagraph 1 from any ensuing years.3. After the calculation of the combined amounts according to Subparagraph 1 above, if the balance is positive, the profit-seeking enterprise may, in accordance with Paragraph 2, Article 7 of the Act, deduct the negative balance of the previous year as calculated according to the preceding subparagraph. If, after the deduction of such negative balance from the positive balance of the previous year, the balance is positive, and, the calculation of the balance (negative balance counted as zero) is made in accordance with Paragraph 3, Article 7 of the Act that for income derived from stock transactions in the current year minus losses from stock transactions in the current year, only one-half of the amount of such balance shall be added into the calculation of the basic income amount, in addition to the amounts accruing in full from the other two types of transactions given in the first subparagraph above, to give the combined total as described in the first subparagraph. However, if, after the deduction of such negative balance, the balance is still negative, such negative amount shall be excluded from the calculation.Paragraph 3, Article 7 of the Act provides that the calculation of the holding period shall be made according to the first-in first-out method.In case any income added to the taxable income in the formula set forth in the third Paragraph of this Article is derived from a source outside the territory of the ROC and in respect of which the income tax paid under the tax law of the source income country where the income is derived, the taxpayer may, after having obtained a tax payment certificate issued in the same tax year by the tax authority of the source income country where the income was derived, and having the certificate duly authenticated by the ROC embassy or consulate, or other authenticating institution acceptable to the ROC Government and located in the foreign place where such income was derived, subtract such offshore income from the amount from the balance calculated in accordance with Paragraph 1, Article 4 of the Act.The maximum amount of the offshore income deductibles under the preceding paragraph shall be calculated in accordance with the following formula: Maximum Amount of the Deductible Offshore Income = (the Amount of Basic Income Tax set forth in Paragraph 1 of Article 12 – the Amount of Taxable Income as calculated in accordance with the Income Tax Act) × the Amount of the Tax-Free Offshore Income that should be added into the amount of the Basic Income in accordance with Paragraph 1, Article 7 of the Act ÷ (the amount of Tax-Free Onshore Income and the Tax-free Offshore Income that should be added into the Amount of the Basic Income in accordance with Paragraph 1, Article 7 of the Act. Article 6
