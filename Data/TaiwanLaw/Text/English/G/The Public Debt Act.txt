To step up debt management and improve the efficiency of financial allocation, the central government and special municipalities may respectively set up a Debt Service Fund to handle fund raising, repayment of maturing debts, repayment of debts early in part or in full, conversion of high-interest debts to low-interest debts, and deal with other matters relevant to financial operations.The sources of funds for the Debt Service Fund referred to in the preceding paragraph are as follows:1.
