Chapter I General PrinciplesArticle 1　 These Regulations are adopted under Article 97, paragraph 2 of the Futures Trading Act.Article 2　 The financial reports of a futures commission merchant (FCM) shall be prepared in accordance with these Regulations and other applicable laws and regulations. Matters not provided for therein shall be governed by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).The GAAP described in the preceding paragraph shall mean the following, as recognized by the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC): International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), International Accounting Standards (IAS), and Interpretations developed by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) or the former Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC).The accounting matters of an FCM based on which the financial reports are prepared shall be governed by the Business Accounting Act and other applicable laws and regulations.Article 3　 When an FCM operates both futures brokerage and futures dealing businesses in accordance with applicable requirements, the accounting matters for each such business shall be handled separately. When an FCM concurrently operates securities business pursuant to Article 45, paragraph 2 of the Securities and Exchange Act, the accounting matters and financial reports for its securities segment shall be governed by applicable securities and exchange laws and regulations.When an FCM concurrently operates a managed futures enterprise pursuant to Article 15 of the Standards Governing the Establishment of Managed Futures Enterprises, it shall prepare financial reports for its discretionary futures trading segment in accordance with Article 21 of the Regulations Governing Managed Futures Enterprises.When an enterprise from another industry concurrently conducts futures business pursuant to Article 57 of the Futures Trading Act, if the treatment of its accounting matters is subject to other applicable laws and regulations of the competent authority in charge of that industry, those laws and regulations shall govern. However, accounting matters and financial reports for its futures operations shall still be governed by these Regulations.Article 4　 An FCM shall establish, and amend when necessary, an accounting system based on the nature of its accounting matters, the actual status and development of its business, and its management needs, and have such available for audit in the future.The accounting system referred to in the preceding paragraph shall, based on the nature of the FCM's business operations, and in a way that meets the needs of preparation of the consolidated financial reports and uniformity in the accounting policies of the FCM and its subsidiaries, separately provide a general description of the accounting system, a chart of journals and ledgers, descriptions and uses of accounting items, accounting documents, account books, and accounting reports, accounting procedures, and finance and payment/disbursement operations.The FCM shall see to it that its subsidiaries establish their accounting systems in accordance with the preceding paragraph.Article 5　 The appointment and discharge of the in-charge accountant of a domestic FCM shall be approved by a majority of the directors present at a board of directors meeting attended by a majority of the directors.A branch office managerial officer authorized by the head office may have sole discretion to appoint and discharge the in-charge accountant of a foreign FCM.Article 6　 Except in the case of a foreign FCM or except as otherwise approved by the FSC, an FCM shall use the calendar year as its financial year, with accounts closed on June 30 for the first half of the financial year and on December 31 for the whole financial year.The accrual basis of accounting shall be used.Accounts shall be expressed in New Taiwan Dollars (NT$).Financial statements shall be presented in thousands of NT dollars.Article 7　 "Financial reports" shall mean financial statements, statements of major accounting items, and any other disclosures and explanatory information within the scope of these Regulations that are helpful to the decision making of users.A complete set of financial statements shall comprise a balance sheet, a statement of comprehensive income, a statement of changes in equity, a statement of cash flows, and their accompanying notes or supplementary schedules.An FCM, unless newly established, or under any of the circumstances set out in paragraph 4 herein, or otherwise required by the FSC, shall prepare the major financial statements and notes described in the preceding paragraph by presenting comparative information for two consecutive periods, and the major financial statements shall also be signed or sealed on each page by the FCM's responsible person, managerial officer, and in-charge accountant. However, an FCM having the status of public company shall be subject to Article 14, paragraph 3 of the Securities and Exchange Act.When an FCM applies an accounting policy retrospectively or makes a retrospective restatement of items in its financial reports, or when it reclassifies items in its financial reports, it shall do so in accordance with the applicable provisions of IAS 1.Article 8　 If an enterprise from another industry concurrently conducts futures business, when preparing financial reports in accordance with the requirements of the competent authority in charge of that industry, it shall additionally disclose a balance sheet, a statement of comprehensive income, accompanying notes, and statements of major accounting items for the independent futures segment prepared in accordance with these Regulations.Article 9　 Financial reports shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an FCM without being misleading to an interested party in making judgments and decisions.If a financial report violates these Regulations or any other applicable requirements, for which the FSC as a result of an audit gives a notice requiring adjustment to be made, the FCM shall make the required adjustment and correction. If the adjusted amount reaches a level specified in Article 6 of the Securities and Exchange Act Enforcement Rules, the financial report shall be restated and be redisclosed publicly, together with a description of the reasons, items, and amount specified in the FSC notice for adjustment. If the corrected amount of the comprehensive income, or of any individual asset line item in the balance sheet (not including reclassified items), does not reach the above threshold, the FCM need not restate the financial report but nevertheless shall present the amount as a correction to retained earnings, other comprehensive income, or the individual asset line item in the balance sheet.Article 10 　 The following shall apply when an FCM makes an accounting change:1.Change in accounting policy:A.When an FCM changes an accounting policy voluntarily in a new financial year in order to produce financial reports that provide reliable and more relevant information about the effects of transactions or other events or conditions on the FCM's financial position, financial performance, or cash flows, it shall request a certified public accountant (CPA) to provide an item-by-item analysis and review opinion on the reasonableness of the nature of the change in accounting policy, the reasons why applying the new accounting policy provides reliable and more relevant information, each line item affected and the estimated effect for the financial year preceding the latest financial year affected by retrospective application of the new accounting policy, and the actual effect on the opening balance of retained earnings for the immediately preceding financial year. These shall be submitted as a proposal for adoption by resolution of the board of directors, after which they shall be submitted to the FSC for approval. Upon approval by the FSC, the FCM shall publicly disclose and file information on the estimated effect arising from the application of the new accounting policy and the CPA review opinion.B.If, for the voluntary change in accounting policy in the new financial year, it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change, as described in paragraph 23 of IAS 8, the FCM shall calculate the effects in accordance with paragraph 24 of IAS 8 and the preceding item above, and shall request a CPA to provide an item-by-item analysis and review opinion on the reasonableness of the reasons why retrospective application is impracticable and how and from when the change in accounting policy has been applied, and also provide an opinion on the impact on the audit opinion for the financial year preceding the change in accounting policy. The FCM shall then follow the procedure described above.C.Unless it is impracticable to determine the effects as described in the preceding item, then within 2 months after the beginning of the financial year in which the new accounting policy is adopted, the FCM shall calculate the line items affected and the actual effect for the financial year preceding the latest financial year affected by retrospective application of the new accounting policy and the actual effect on the opening balance of retained earnings for the immediately preceding financial year, and shall submit those for adoption by the board of directors, after which they shall be publicly disclosed and filed and submitted to the FSC for recordation. If the difference between the actual effect of the change in accounting policy and the original estimated effect is NT0 million or more, and is also 1 percent or more of the income for the immediately preceding financial year or 5 percent or more of paid-in capital, the FCM shall analyze the reasons for the difference and request a CPA to provide an opinion on its reasonableness. The analysis and the CPA's opinion shall also be publicly disclosed and filed with the FSC.D.Except when an FCM applies a new accounting policy to newly purchased assets, in which case the provisions of the preceding items need not be applied, and except when, after the beginning of a financial year, an FCM voluntarily changes an accounting policy during the year in which regulatory adjustments have come into force, in which case the FCM shall request a CPA to issue a review opinion and submit it for adoption by the board of directors and publicly disclose it and then shall file the review opinion and relevant materials with the FSC for recordation, if a change in accounting policy is applied without having been duly filed for approval, the financial reports for the financial year in which the new accounting policy was applied shall be restated, and the new accounting policy may only be applied from the next financial year after a supplementary submission has been made and approved.E.In the case of an FCM whose shares have a par value other than NT0, in the calculation of the 5 percent of paid-in capital under item C, 2.5 percent of the equity attributable to owners of the parent as stated in the balance sheet shall be substituted.2.With respect to any matter among accounting estimates relating to a change in the useful life or depreciation method of depreciable assets, a change in the amortization period or amortization method of intangible assets, or a change in the residual value of any such assets, in addition to complying with item D of the preceding subparagraph, the FCM shall request a CPA to provide an analysis and review opinion on the reasonableness of the nature of the changes in accounting estimates and the reasons why the changes in accounting estimates can provide reliable and more relevant information. The changes in accounting estimates shall then be submitted as a proposal for adoption by resolution of the board of directors, and then submitted to the FSC for approval.The expression "public disclosure and filing" or "publicly disclose and file" as used in the preceding paragraph means entering the information into the website designated by the FSC for the submission of electronic filings.Article 11 　 Unless otherwise required by the FSC, the records retention period for the financial reports identified in these Regulations, or for the accounting documents, journals, ledgers, deeds, vouchers, and books based on which the financial reports are prepared, shall be subject to the Business Accounting Act.Article 12 　 An FCM shall prepare consolidated financial reports in accordance with Chapter II of these Regulations and IFRS 10, and shall prepare annual parent company only financial reports in accordance with Chapter IV of these Regulations.An FCM that does not have a subsidiary shall prepare individual financial reports in accordance with Chapter II of these Regulations, and when preparing annual financial reports shall follow the provisions of Articles 29 to 34 of these Regulations.An FCM preparing interim financial reports shall follow the provisions of Chapters II and III of these Regulations as well as IAS 34.
