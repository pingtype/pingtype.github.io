These shall be submitted as a proposal for adoption by resolution of the board of directors, after which they shall be submitted to the FSC for approval.B.If, for the voluntary change in accounting policy in the new financial year, it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change, as described in paragraph 23 of IAS 8, the company-type futures exchange shall calculate the effects in accordance with paragraph 24 of IAS 8 and the preceding item above, and shall request a CPA to provide an item-by-item analysis and review opinion on the reasonableness of the reasons why retrospective application is impracticable and how and from when the change in accounting policy has been applied, and also provide an opinion on the impact on the audit opinion for the earliest financial year affected by the change in accounting policy for which an application is submitted to the FSC for approval.
