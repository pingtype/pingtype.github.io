In cases where a public notice has been made pursuant to Article 9, and interested parties have been given opportunities to submit information and make comments, the MOF may, after a preliminary determination of the existence of subsidy or dumping and of the consequent injury to the domestic industry, apply provisional countervailing or anti-dumping measures after consulting with the authorities concerned, in order to prevent injury to the domestic industry during the investigation period, and shall notify the applicant and all known interested parties immediately and make a public notice thereof.The duty-payer may provide security or guarantee as set forth in Article 11 of the Act, for the imposition of provisional countervailing duty or antidumping duty as referred to in the preceding paragraph.The provisional countervailing duty or anti-dumping duty shall not be levied during the sixty-day period from the date of initiating an investigation. The maximum provisional duty levy period is four months. However, upon the request of the foreign exporter occupying a considerable ratio of the trade volume, the maximum imposition period of the provisional antidumping duty may be extended to six months.　When the MOF, in the course of an investigation, considers to examine whether a duty lower than the margin of dumping would be sufficient to remove injury, the aforesaid imposition periods of four months and six months shall be extended to six months and nine months respectively following determination by the Commission. Article 14

(delete) Article 25-1
Upon approval of the application of undertaking decided by Commission, government of the exporting country or the foreign exporters shall fulfill commitments prescribed in the undertaking pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article 23, and cope with the verification to be done by the MOF.Where the government of the exporting country or the foreign exporter is in violation of the undertaking, the competent authorities may terminate the undertaking, and shall conduct the following regulations:1.Where the final determination has been made, and the imposition of countervailing duty or anti-dumping duty has been decided, the approved duty rate is to be imposed accordingly.2.The investigation of the case being suspended pursuant to paragraph 1 of Article 24, such investigation shall be completed as soon as possible. In cases when the countervailing duty or anti-dumping duty was not provisionally imposed or when such imposition was suspended, the MOF may, when necessary, provisionally impose the countervailing duty or anti-dumping duty after submission of facts available to the Commission for determination. Where the imposition of a countervailing duty or anti-dumping duty is determined, the definitive duties may be levied on products imported not more than 90 days before the application of such a provisional imposition of the duties. However, the imposition of definitive duties shall not apply to products imported prior to the violation. Article 26
For the purpose of the Regulations, a subsidy shall be deemed to exist if any of the following measures is provided directly or indirectly by the government or a public body of the exporting country to the specific enterprise or industry and thereby a benefit is conferred:1. the provision of grants, loans or equity infusions.2. the provision of loan guarantees.3. the expungement or non-collection of taxes that are otherwise due.4. the purchase of goods or provision of goods or services other than for general infrastructure.5. the provision of income or price support.The following circumstances shall not be considered as conferring a benefit:1. the provision of equity capital by the government or a public body of the exporting country is consistent with the usual investment practice of the private sector.2. there is no difference between the commercial loan that the firm receiving from the government or a public body of the exporting country and the commercial loan the firm could actually obtain on the market.3. there is no difference between the amount that the firm receiving the guarantee pays on a loan guaranteed by the government or a public body of the exporting country and the amount the firm would pay on a comparable commercial loan absent the government guarantee.4. the provision of goods or services by the government or a public body of the exporting country is no less than adequate remuneration or the purchase of goods is no more than adequate remuneration. The adequacy of remuneration shall be determined in relation to prevailing market conditions. Article 27
For the purpose of the Regulations, the amount of subsidy shall be determined by the amount received on a per unit basis of the imported product, and any of the following circumstances shall be taken into account accordingly:1. where the expenses incurred are for obtaining the subsidy, or where the export duty or tax is imposed by the exporting country to counteract the subsidy, such expenses, and duty or tax shall be deducted;2. where the subsidy is not granted on the basis of the quantity of production or exportation, the total amount of the subsidy shall be allocated to the products produced or exported during a specific period of time;3. where the subsidy is granted in the form of a loan or loan guarantee, it shall be calculated by referring to the difference between the interest actually paid, or payable by the recipient, and the interest payable under the comparable commercial loan or loan guarantee in the exporting country. Article 28
Any of the following circumstances shall not be treated as being in the ordinary course of trade pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article 68 of the Act, and the price thereof shall not be considered as the normal value:1.where the cost or price is affected because of an association or a compensatory arrangement between the purchaser and seller; or2.where sales of the like product in the exporting country, country of origin or sales to a third country at prices below per unit costs of production plus administrative, selling and other relevant costs, which are made within an extended period of time, and all the weighted average selling prices of the transactions are below the weighted average per unit cost, or that the volume of sales below per unit costs represents more than 20 percent of the volume sold in the transaction, and are at prices which do not provide for the recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time. If prices which are below per unit costs at the time of sale are above the weighted average cost during the period of investigation, such prices shall be considered to provide for recovery of costs within a reasonable period of time. Article 29
For the purpose of the Regulations, the term “in the absence of the comparable domestic selling price” as referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 68 of the Act indicates that the domestic market of the country of export or origin is subject to one of the following situations:1. where there are no sales of the like product in the ordinary course of trade;2. where the volume of sales of the like product is less than five percent of the volume of sales of such product to the country. However, a lower ratio shall be acceptable if the sales are made under ordinary course of trade and are sufficient to provide for a proper comparison; and3. where there is a particular market situation. Article 30
Pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article 68 of the Act, when there is no comparable domestic selling price and the constructed value is used as the basis for comparison, the amounts for administrative, selling and other relevant expenses, and for normal profits shall be based on actual data pertaining to production and sales of the foreign producer or exporter in the ordinary course of trade of the subject product. When such amounts cannot be determined on this basis, the amounts shall be determined on the basis of:1. the actual expenses and profit incurred and realized by the foreign producer or exporter under investigation in respect of production and sales in the domestic market of the country of origin of the like product;2. the actual weighted average expenses and profit incurred and realized by other foreign producers or exporters subject to investigation in respect of production and sales of the like product in the domestic market of the country of origin;3. any other reasonable method, provided that the amount for profit so established shall not exceed the profit normally realized by other exporters or producers on sales of the like product in the domestic market of the country of origin. Article 31
For the case in which there is no imported selling price or where it appears that the selling price of the product under investigation is unreliable because of association or a compensatory arrangement between the foreign exporter and the domestic importer or a third party, the selling price may be constructed by the MOF on the basis of the price at which the imported products are first resold to an independent buyer. Article 32
For the purpose of the Regulations, the dumping margin shall be determined by the difference between the selling price of imported products into this country and its normal price.The aforementioned dumping margin may be established on the basis of a comparison of a weighted average imported selling price into this country with a weighted average normal value, or by a comparison of the imported selling price and normal value on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Where the imported selling price of the products entering into the country differs significantly among different purchasers, regions or time periods, the individual selling price may be compared with a weighted average normal value.With respect to the constructed selling price of the goods imported into this country determined pursuant to Article 31, the following expenses incurred between importation and resale shall be deducted prior to making a comparison with the normal value:1. insurance, transportation, handling, loading and unloading, and other relevant expenses;2. customs duties and other taxes; and3. reasonable profit or commission normally realized.For the case in which products are not imported directly from the country of origin but are exported to this country from a third country, the dumping margin shall be determined by comparing the imported selling price of the products entering into this country and the normal value in the third country pursuant to paragraph 1 above. However, a comparison may be made between the normal value in the country of origin, if the products are merely trans-shipped through the third country, or if such products are not produced in the third country, or if there is no normal value for them in the third country.When the country of origin or export is a non-market economy, the normal value shall be determined by comparing comparable selling price or constructed value of the like product in a market economy third country, or by comparing comparable selling price of the like product from such a third country to another market economy country, or to this country; or where these are not possible, on such other reasonable basis as may be determined. Article 33
The determination of the dumping margin, pursuant to the preceding Article, shall, in addition, comply with the following:1.comparison made between the imported selling price into the country and the normal value, shall be made at the same level of trade and at as nearly as possible the same time.2.adjustments shall be made for differences in physical characteristics, taxation, level of trade, transaction time, quantity, terms of sale, and other factors which affect price comparability.When the comparison under subparagraph 1 of previous paragraph requires a conversion of currencies, such conversion shall be made using the rate of exchange on the date of sale.　The exporters shall be given an opportunity to adjust their imported selling price of the products entering into this country to reflect sustained movements in exchange rate during the period of investigation. However, when a sale of foreign currency on forward markets is directly linked to the export sale involved, the rate of exchange in the forward sale shall be used. Article 34
The dumping margin as referred to in Article 32 shall be determined individually for each known foreign producer or exporter under investigation.For the case in which the number of foreign producers, exporters, domestic importers, or types of products involved are so large as to make such a determination impracticable, the authorities concerned may limit their investigation either to a reasonable number of interested parties or products, or to parties of the largest percentage of the volume of the exports from the subject country, so as to determine the individual dumping margin for each foreign producer or exporter under investigation.Pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the MOF shall determine an individual dumping margin and applicable duty rate for any foreign producer or exporter not initially selected who submits the necessary information in time, except where the number of producers or exporters is so large as to affect the investigation. Article 35
Any anti-dumping duty applied to foreign producers or exporters not included in the initially selected investigation, pursuant to the preceding Article, shall not exceed the weighted average dumping margin established with respect to the foreign producers or exporters selected for investigation.Where any dumping margin established for selected foreign producers or exporters with respect to the circumstances referred to in subparagraph 3 of paragraph 1 of Article 15, or Article 21, such dumping margin shall be disregarded in the calculation of the aforementioned weighted average. Article 35-1
Foreign producers or exporters of the case may apply for the new shipper review to MOF with relevant documents or proof of evidence, and request for an individual dumping margin, respectively, provided that:1.no exportation of product concerned to Taiwan during the period of investigation.2.they can show that they are not related to any of the exporters or producers of the case, and they have not exported the product concerned to Taiwan during the period of investigation.3.they have exported a significant quantity of the product concerned to Taiwan following the original period of investigation.After the public notice of the imposition of anti-dumping duty, exporter or producer may apply for new shipper review pursuant to the preceding paragraph to the MOF, within one year from the date of the first importation of the product concerned.With respect to the case of new shipper review, the MOF shall finish the investigation within nine months from the date of public notice of the initiation of the review, and submit its proposal to the Commission for decision.
