The major financial statements shall also be signed or sealed on each page by the futures clearing house's responsible person, managerial officer, and in-charge accountant.When a futures clearing house applies an accounting policy retrospectively or makes a retrospective restatement of items in its financial statements, or when it reclassifies items in its financial statements, it shall do so in accordance with the relevant provisions of IAS 1.Article 7　 Financial reports shall be able to present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of a futures clearing house without being misleading to an interested party in making judgments and decisions.If a financial report violates these Regulations or any other applicable requirements, for which the FSC as a result of an audit gives a notice of adjustment, the futures clearing house shall make the required adjustment and correction. If the adjusted amount reaches the threshold set forth in Article 6 of the Securities and Exchange Act Enforcement Rules, the financial report shall be restated and submitted to the FSC.Article 8　 The following shall apply when a futures clearing house makes an accounting change:1.Change in accounting policy:A.When a futures clearing house changes an accounting policy voluntarily in a new financial year in order to produce financial reports that provide reliable and more relevant information about the effects of transactions or other events or conditions on the futures clearing house's financial position, financial performance, or cash flows, it shall request a certified public accountant (CPA) to provide an item-by-item analysis and review opinion on the reasonableness of the nature of the change in accounting policy, the reasons why applying the new accounting policy provides reliable and more relevant information, each line item affected and the estimated effect for the financial year preceding the earliest financial year affected by retrospective application of the new accounting policy, and the actual effect on the opening balance of retained earnings for the immediately preceding financial year. These shall be submitted as a proposal for adoption by resolution of the board of directors, after which they shall be submitted to the FSC for approval.B.If, for the voluntary change in accounting policy in the new financial year, it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change, as described in paragraph 23 of IAS 8, the futures clearing house shall calculate the effects in accordance with paragraph 24 of IAS 8 and the preceding item above, and shall request a CPA to provide an item-by-item analysis and review opinion on the reasonableness of the reasons why retrospective application is impracticable and how and from when the change in accounting policy has been applied, and also provide an opinion on the impact on the audit opinion for the earliest financial year affected by the change in accounting policy for which an application is submitted to the FSC for approval. The futures clearing house shall then follow the procedure described above.C.Unless it is impracticable to determine the effects as described in the preceding item, then within 2 months after the beginning of the financial year in which the new accounting policy is adopted, the futures clearing house shall calculate the line items affected and the actual effects for the financial year preceding the earliest financial year affected by retrospective application of the new accounting policy and the actual effects on the opening balance of retained earnings for the immediately preceding financial year, and shall submit those for adoption by the board of directors, after which they shall be filed with the FSC for recordation. If the difference between the actual effects of the change in accounting policy and the effects originally filed with the FSC is NT0 million or more, and is also 1 percent or more of net operating revenues for the immediately preceding financial year, or 5 percent or more of paid-in capital, the futures clearing house shall analyze the reasons for the difference and request a CPA to provide an opinion on its reasonableness. The analysis and the CPA's opinion shall also be filed with the FSC.D.Except when applying a new accounting policy to newly purchased assets, in which case the provisions of the preceding items need not be applied, if a change in accounting policy is applied without having been duly filed for approval, the financial reports for the financial year in which the new accounting policy was applied shall be restated, and the new accounting policy may only be applied from the next financial year after a supplementary filing has been made and approved.E.If the shares of the futures clearing house have a par value other than NT0 per share, for the calculation of the 5 percent of paid-in capital under item C, 2.5 percent of the equity attributable to the owners of the parent as stated in the balance sheet shall be substituted.2.With respect to any matter in accounting estimates relating to a change in the useful life or depreciation method of depreciable assets, a change in the amortization period or amortization method of intangible assets, or a change in the residual value of any such assets, in addition to complying with item D of the preceding subparagraph, a futures clearing house shall request a CPA to provide an analysis and review opinion on the reasonableness of the nature of the changes in accounting estimates and the reasons why the changes in accounting estimates would provide reliable and more relevant information. Those changes in accounting estimates shall then be submitted as a proposal for adoption by resolution of the board of directors, after which they shall be submitted to the FSC for approval.Article 9　 A futures clearing house shall prepare consolidated financial reports in accordance with Chapter II of these Regulations and IFRS 10, and shall prepare annual parent company only financial reports in accordance with Chapter IV of these Regulations.A futures clearing house that does not have a subsidiary shall prepare individual financial reports in accordance with Chapter II of these Regulations, and when preparing annual individual financial reports shall also prepare statements of major accounting items in accordance with Article 25 of these Regulations.A futures clearing house preparing interim financial reports shall follow the provisions of Chapters II and III of these Regulations as well as IAS 34 and when preparing semi-annual financial reports shall also prepare semi-annual parent company only financial reports pursuant to Articles 23 to 25, or semi-annual individual financial reports pursuant to Article 25.Article 10 　 The meaning of "parent," "subsidiary," "associate," and joint arrangement, as used in these Regulations, shall be determined in accordance with IFRS 10, IFRS 11, and IAS 28.The meaning of "control," "significant influence," or "joint control" as used in these Regulations shall be determined in accordance with IFRS 10, IFRS 11, and IAS 28.Chapter II Financial ReportsSection I Balance SheetArticle 11　 Assets shall be properly classified.

accounting matters, as provided in regulations governing the preparation of financial reports by a futures exchange or other institution, or in these Regulations, such requirements shall govern.Article 27 　 The nature and classification of the particular accounting items set up by a futures exchange or other institution for its concurrent operation of the business of a futures clearing house are described below:1.Operating capital for clearing business and operating capital: As required by the Standards Governing the Establishment of Futures Clearing Houses, a futures exchange or other institution that concurrently operates the business of a futures clearing house shall allocate an amount equal to the minimum paid-in capital of a futures clearing house as earmarked operating capital for use in the futures clearing segment. Operating capital for clearing business is presented as an item under other non-current assets in the balance sheet of the futures exchange or other institution (excluding the futures clearing segment), and operating capital is presented as an item under equity in the balance sheet for the futures clearing segment. However, in preparing a consolidated balance sheet, these two items shall be offset against each other rather than being presented separately.2.Intra-entity accounts-clearing segment: In the case of a futures exchange or other institution concurrently operating the business of a futures clearing house, these are monetary transactions between a non-futures clearing segment and the futures clearing segment. For such intra-entity accounts, a debit balance is presented as an item under other assets in the balance sheet of the futures exchange or other institution (excluding the futures clearing segment) or in the balance sheet for the futures clearing segment, and a credit balance as an item under other liabilities in the balance sheet of the futures exchange or other institution (excluding the futures clearing segment) or in the balance sheet for the futures clearing segment. However, in preparing a consolidated balance sheet, a net balance shall be presented after offsetting debits against credits, provided that the details shall be indicated in the notes to the financial reports.Article 28 　 In the case of a futures exchange or other institution concurrently operating the business of a futures clearing house, items associated with stock shares, such as share capital, share premiums under capital surplus, and treasury shares, are not presented in the financial statements for the futures clearing segment. If as a result an increase or decrease occurs in the allocation of operating capital for clearing business, there shall be a concurrent increase or decrease in the operating capital for clearing business of the futures exchange or other institution (excluding the futures clearing segment) and in the operating capital of the futures clearing segment.Article 29 　 When a futures exchange or other institution concurrently operates the business of a futures clearing house, then if there is an annual deficit or earnings for the futures exchange or other institution (excluding the futures clearing segment) and the futures clearing segment conversely has annual earnings or deficit, and if the earnings of one exceed the deficit of the other, then the full amount of the appropriation from earnings for the legal reserve and special reserve made in accordance with the Company Act, the articles of incorporation, or a resolution of the shareholders meeting shall be recognized for the one that had the annual earnings, whether the futures exchange or other institution (excluding the futures clearing segment) or the futures clearing segment.Article 30 　 If as a result of its concurrent operation of the business of a futures clearing house a futures exchange or other institution needs to prepare a standalone balance sheet and statement of comprehensive income for its futures clearing segment, their titles and forms are as follows:1.Balance sheet (Form 9).Balance sheet-futures clearing segment (Form 9-1).2.Statement of comprehensive income (Form 10). Statement of comprehensive income-futures clearing segment (Form 10-1).Chapter VI First-time AdoptionArticle 31 　 IFRS 1 applies when a futures clearing house first adopts IFRS.Except when electing to use the deemed cost exemption in accordance with Article 32 below, the futures clearing house shall apply IAS 40, IAS 16, and IAS 38 retrospectively to investment property, property and equipment not classified as for investment or held for sale, and intangible assets in accordance with the preceding paragraph at the date of transition to IFRS.Article 32 　 A futures clearing house electing to use the deemed cost exemption described in IFRS 1 shall be subject to the following:1.If the fair value of an item of investment property is elected to be its deemed cost, the securities firm shall comply with Article 9, paragraph 4, subparagraph 4 of the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers.2.For an item of investment property that does not fall within the scope of the preceding subparagraph allowing the use of fair value as deemed cost, of property and equipment not classified as for investment or held for sale, or of intangible assets, the futures clearing house may only elect to use a previous GAAP revaluation of that item as deemed cost at the date of the revaluation.Article 33 　 For the financial assets or financial liabilities measured at cost upon initial recognition prior to the date of conversion, a futures clearing house may, on the date of conversion, elect to use the exemption designated by the previously recognized financial instruments pursuant to IFRS 1, or classifies them as financial assets or financial liabilities held for trading on the premises that they meet the conditions for financial assets or financial liabilities held for trading under Article 11 or 12 of these Regulations.Financial assets or financial liabilities not included in the preceding paragraph may not be reclassified on the date of conversion.Chapter VII Joint ArrangementsArticle 34 　 Joint arrangements are either joint operations or joint ventures, and have the following characteristics: 1.All of the parties are bound by a contractual arrangement.2.The contractual arrangement gives two or more of those parties joint control of the arrangement.When a joint arrangement is a joint operation, the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses relating to the joint operation shall be recognized in accordance with these Regulations, applicable IFRSs, and contractual agreement.When a joint arrangement is a joint venture, the interest in the joint venture shall be accounted for using the equity method pursuant to Article 11, paragraph 4, subparagraph 2 and IAS 28.Chapter VIII Supplementary ProvisionsArticle 35 　 These Regulations shall come into force from the date of issuance, with the exception of Articles 3, Article 6, Article 9, paragraph 1, Articles 10 to 15, Article 17, Article 19, Article 21, Article 22, Article 23, Article 30, Article 32, and Article 34, which shall come into force from the beginning of financial year 2015.
