After accepting an application in the foregoing article, the industry competent authority shall complete a documentary review of the plan within fourteen days. The competent authority shall notify the enterprise to proceed with gasoline vapor line burial and relevant testing after the application passes review. If the plan or related documents are incomplete or fail to pass review, the competent authority shall immediately notify the enterprise to make corrections or improvements within a limited period. The number of days for making corrections shall not be included within the review period, but the total number of days for making corrections may not exceed ninety days.Liquid blockage testing shall be performed after the completion of gasoline vapor line burial in the foregoing paragraph. The competent authority shall be notified five days prior to testing, and the competent authority may send personnel to supervise testing. The gas station shall record the test results and submit them to the competent authority for review within fifteen days after completion of testing. The competent authority shall issue verification documents only after checking that the results comply with the regulations. Article 6
Newly-established gas stations shall complete installation of gasoline vapor recovery facilities and air to liquid volume ratio and gasoline vapor leak testing within six months after obtaining a business license respectively. All gas stations shall record the testing results and submit them to the local competent authority for reference within fifteen days after completion of testing. Article 7
The maximum pressure drop found in liquid blockage testing of gasoline vapor lines from gasoline pumps to gasoline tanks at newly-established gas stations shall comply with the following regulations:┌───────────┬─────────┬────────┐│Liquid blockage test│Maximum pressure│Allowable error ││nitrogen flow│drop│ │├───────────┼─────────┼────────┤│0.56 Cubic meters/hour│0.38 centimeter│1/100││(20 cubic inches/hour)│water column (0.15│ ││ │inch water column)│ │├───────────┼─────────┼────────┤│1.70 Cubic meters/hour│1.14 centimeter│1/100││(60 cubic inches/hour)│water column (0.45│ ││ │inch water column)│ │├───────────┼─────────┼────────┤│2.83 Cubic meters/hour│2.41 centimeter│1/100││(100 cubic│water column (0.95│ ││inches/hour) │inch water column)│ │└───────────┴─────────┴────────┘ Article 8
A gas station shall maintain the effective operation of refueling guns and gasoline vapor recovery facilities; air to liquid volume ratio testing and vapor leak testing shall comply with the following regulations:┌──────┬──────┬─────┬──────────┐│Test items│Acceptable│Allowable │Remarks │││range │error││├──────┼──────┼─────┼──────────┤│Air to│1.35 - 2.40 │1/100│Possessing equipment││Liquid││ │using combustion or ││Volume Ratio││ │condensation methods││Testing (Air││ │to handle excess ││Intake││ │gasoline vapor after││Volume/││ │the gasoline vapor││Gasoline ││ │has been returned to││Volume)││ │the fuel tank.││├──────┼─────┼──────────┤││0.88 - 1.20 │1/100│Not having the││││ │foregoing equipment │├──────┼──────┼─────┼──────────┤│Vapor Leak│4.83 - 5.33 │1/100│Pressurize the line ││Test│centimeter│ │to 5.08 centimeter│││water column│ │water column (2 inch│││(1.90 - 2.10│ │water column); test │││inch water│ │time should be five │││column)│ │minutes │└──────┴──────┴─────┴──────────┘ Article 8-1
When local competent authorities perform air to liquid volume ratio testing of gas station refueling guns, at least one-half of the number of refueling guns of each gasoline pump shall be tested. The gas station shall be deemed to have been failed when any of the following situations involving test results apply:I.The number of refueling guns meeting the air to liquid volume ratio test standards in the foregoing article is less than 70% of the total number of refueling guns tested.II.When the number of refueling guns meeting air to liquid volume ratio test standards in the foregoing article is at least 70% of the refueling guns tested, the refueling guns that fail to meet the passing standards shall include those for which improvements have not been completed on time after the competent authority has ordered improvement within a limited time period.If a gas station cannot complete improvement within the time period in the second subparagraph of the foregoing paragraph, it shall submit an explanation of reason to the local competent authority and apply for an extension by the improvement deadline. The total number of days of extension may not exceed 90 days.Any refueling guns at a gas station that are not in use for some reason shall be marked and locked; unused refueling guns that are reported to the local competent authority within 24 hours may be exempted from the testing mentioned in Paragraph 1. Article 9
Gas stations shall themselves perform, or commission professional testing personnel to perform vapor leak testing once every two years. Testing shall be performed during the period from one month before to one month after the month of the previous testing. Each refueling gun shall be subjected to air to liquid volume ratio testing at least once during the first half and also during the second half of each year. The interval between two consecutive tests shall be at least three months. The local competent authority may, when necessary, request a gas station to increase the frequency of testing.If the average amount of gasoline dispensed at a gas station is less than 200 kiloliters per month for three consecutive months, after the gas station has requested and obtained the competent authority’s approval, the frequency of vapor leak testing may be reduced to once every three years and the frequency of refueling gun air to liquid volume ratio testing may be reduced to once each year, where the interval between two consecutive tests shall be at least six months. However, testing shall be handled in accordance with the regulations of the foregoing paragraph when the amount of gasoline dispensed at a gas station during any one quarter exceeds 600 kiloliters.Gas stations that have received approval in accordance with the regulations of the foregoing paragraph shall report to the local competent authority for future reference the amount of gasoline dispensed during each month of the previous quarter before the end of each January, April, July, and October. Testing shall be handled in accordance with the regulations of Paragraph 1 when a gas station fails to report in accordance with the regulations.A gas station that has failed air to liquid volume ratio testing or vapor leak testing performed in accordance with the regulations of Paragraph 1 shall complete improvements within 20 days; a gas station that cannot complete improvements by the deadline shall apply to the local competent authority for an extension by the deadline.A gas station refueling gun that is not in use for six months or more due to some reason must pass air-to-liquid volume ratio testing; a report must be made to the local competent authority before the refueling gun can be used again. Article 10
The results of improvement, repair, and testing performed in accordance with these Regulations shall be recorded and preserved for two years for reference. Article 11
