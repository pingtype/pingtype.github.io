Article 1
These Regulations are determined pursuant to Article 16, Paragraph 2 of the Air Pollution Control Act (herein referred to as this Act). Article 2
The amount of collected air pollution control fees based on designated and officially announced substance sales volumes as defined in Article 16, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 1 of this Act, and the air pollution control fees based on the type, composition and quantity of fuel as defined in Article 16, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 2 of this Act shall be calculated according to the type of fuel, composition and property standards, and the batch sales volume for each individual fuel type each month. Before the fifteenth day of each month fuel vendors or importers shall fill out an air pollution control fee report form and payment form based on the format determined by the central competent authority, pay the air pollution control fee for the previous month to the financial institution account designated by the central competent authority and make a filing with the central competent authority via the Internet. However, if the central competent authority grants its consent, the filing may be made in writing. Article 3
The amount of air pollution control fees shall be based on the type and quantity of air pollutants as defined in Article 16, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 1 of this Act and shall be calculated, reported and paid by the fee payer on his own initiative according to the types of emitted pollutants, emissions quantity and record of operations for each business quarter and based on the fee rates announced in Article 17, Paragraph 2 of this Act. The owner, manager or actual user of the stationary pollution source shall fill out an air pollution control fee report form and payment form based on the format determined by the central competent authority, pay the air pollution control fee for the previous quarter to the financial institution account designated by the central competent authority and make a filing with the central competent authority via the Internet before the last day of April, July, and October of each year and January of the following year. However, if the central competent authority grants its consent, the filing may be made in writing.The type and quantity of emitted air pollutants referred to in the previous paragraph means the air pollutants emitted from the normal operation of a stationary pollution source and significant emission of air pollutants caused by the following:I.Equipment breakdown caused by defective design or improper operation.II.Improper maintenance or human neglect.III. Other reasons determined by the central competent authority.Based on the type and quantity of air pollutants emitted in each quarter of the current year from public and private premises of stationary pollution source, if it has been assessed by the central competent authority that the emission of each type of individual air pollutant per business quarter is less than one ton, an application may be filed with the central competent authority before the end of January of the following year for adjusting the quarterly reporting of the volume of air pollutant emission of each quarter and payment of air pollution control fees for the previous year to one-time reporting and payment before the end of January of each year.If the emission of individual type of air pollutants emitted by the public or private premises under the previous paragraph exceeds one ton during any quarter, the report and fee shall be filed and paid according to the regulations of the first paragraph. Article 4
When a stationary pollution source at public or private premises that reports the air pollution control fee in accordance with the previous Article emits two or more pollutants, the amount of fees due shall be calculated based on the individual pollutant emissions quantities.
