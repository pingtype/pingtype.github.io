A representative shall supply a notarized appointment letter.Article 3　 The terms used in the Regulations are defined as follows:I.Chemical Substance refers to a chemical element and its compounds in the natural state or obtained by any manufacturing process, including any additive necessary to preserve its stability and any unintended constituent deriving from the process used, but excluding any solvent which may be separated without affecting the stability of the substance or changing its composition.II.Substance which Occur in Nature refers to substance that is unprocessed, processed only by manual, gravitational, or mechanical means, by dissolution in water, by water extraction, by vapor distillation, by flotation, by heating solely to remove water, are extracted from air by any means, without chemical change in the substance; or large molecules from organisms, or polymers occurring in nature and not chemically processed.III. Mixture refers to a mixture or a solution composed of two or more substances in which they do not react.IV.Article refers to a manufactured item formed to a specific shape or design during manufacture.V.Polymer refers to a chemical substance that fits the following criteria:A.A macro-molecular chemical substance consisting of molecules characterized by the sequence of one or more types of monomer units.B.A molecule contains at least three monomer units covalently bound; such molecules take over 50% of the weight of that substance, and the amount of the said molecules presenting the same molecular weight must be less than 50% of the weight of that substance.C.Differences in the molecular weight are primarily attributable to differences in the number of monomer units.VI.Polymers for which the 2% Rule is Applicable refers to the monomer-based representation of polymers which may include or may not include monomers and other reactants used at 2 weight percent or less. A monomer-based representation means naming of polymers is based on constituent monomers.VII. Polymer of Low Concern (PLC) refers to a substance that is evaluated by the central competent authority, and fulfills any one of the following conditions:A.A polymer with an average molecular weight in a range of 1,000 to 10,000 Daltons, contains oligomers of molecular weights below 500 Daltons in amount of less than 10%; oligomers below 1,000 Daltons in amount of less than 25%.B.A polymer with an average molecular weight over 10,000 Daltons, contains oligomers of molecular weights below 500 Daltons in amount of less than 2%; oligomers below 1,000 Daltons in amount of less than 5%.C.Polyester polymers.D.Insoluble polymers.VIII.Intermediate refers to a chemical substance produced and consumed in the course of the manufacture of another chemical substance.IX.On-site Isolated Intermediates refers to intermediates that are produced and consumed on the same site.X.Incidental Reaction Products refers to chemical substances produced when a substance undergoes a chemical reaction that is consequent to the use of the substance, the result of storage or the change of environmental factors.XI.Impurity refers to an unintended constituent present in a substance as produced. It originates from the starting materials or is the result of secondary or incomplete reactions during the production process. While it is present along with the final substance it was not intentionally added, nor does it enhance the commercial value of that substance. The concentration of an individual impurity is no more than 10% (w/w). All impurities presented are no more than 20% (w/w).XII. Scientific Research and Development refers to any scientific experimentation, education, analysis, or chemical research carried out under strictly controlled conditions.XIII.Product and Process Orientated Research and Development (PPORD) refers to any scientific development related to product development or the further development of a substance, in the course of which pilot plant or production trials are used to develop the production process or to test the fields of application of the substance.XIV. Substance of Carcinogenic, Mutagenic or Toxic for Reproduction (CMR) refers to a substance that meets any criteria of carcinogenicity category 1; mutagenicity category 1; reproductive toxicity category 1, based on R.O.C. National Standards (CNS) 15030.XV.Substances under Customs Supervision refers to chemical substances under customs supervision, which are in temporary storage or placed in a harbor’s designated area or warehouse, container freight station, bonded warehouse, logistics center or free trade zone, with a provision for re-exportation or transit.Article 4　 The Regulations shall not apply to any of the following conditions:I.Substances which occur in natureII.Chemical substances in machines or equipment for test?run purposesIII. Inseparable intermediates from chemical reactions in the reaction vessel or production processIV.Chemical substances for national defense purposesV.Chemical substances under customs supervisionVI.WasteVII. By-product or impurity that is of no commercial applicationVIII.Mixtures; Exemption is not applicable to the individual chemical constituents of the mixturesIX.ArticlesX.A polymer for which the 2% rule is applicable and listed on the inventory of existing chemical substances, or that is a new chemical substance meeting the 2% ruleXI.Matters governed by the following respective laws:A.Agro-pesticides, as defined by the Agro-pesticides Management ActB.Feeds and feed additives, as defined by the Feed Control ActC.Fertilizers, as defined by the Fertilizer Management ActD.Veterinary drugs, as defined by the Veterinary Drugs Control ActE.Medicaments, as defined by the Pharmaceutical Affairs ActF.Controlled drugs, as defined by the Controlled Drugs ActG.Cosmetic(s), as defined by the Statute for Control of Cosmetic HygieneH.Foods and food additives, as defined by the Act Governing Food Safety and SanitationI.Tobacco products, as defined by the Tobacco Hazards Prevention ActJ.Tobacco and alcohol, as defined by the Tobacco and Alcohol Administration ActK.Radioactive Materials, as defined by the Atomic Energy Act and the Ionizing Radiation Protection ActL.Chemicals regulated by the Montreal Protocol under the Air Pollution Control ActM.Environmental agents, as defined by the Environmental Agents Control ActChapter 2New Chemical RegistrationArticle 5　 For a new chemical substance to be manufactured or imported in estimated annual volumes of one ton or more; or for a new chemical substance to be manufactured or imported for the purposes of scientific research and development, and product and process orientated research and development, in estimated annual volumes of ten tons or more, the registrant shall apply for the standard registration and submit data as specified in Appendix 1.For a new chemical substance to be manufactured or imported in estimated annual volumes of 100 kilograms or more, but less than one ton; or for a new chemical substance to be manufactured or imported for the purposes of scientific research and development, and product and process orientated research and development, in estimated annual volumes of one ton or more, but less than ten tons, the registrant shall apply for the simplified registration and submit data as specified in Appendix 2.For a new chemical substance to be manufactured or imported in estimated annual volumes of less than 100 kilograms; or for a new chemical substance manufactured or imported for the purposes of product and process orientated research and development, in estimated annual volumes of less than one ton, the registrant shall apply for the small quantity registration and submit data as specified in Appendix 3.Appendix 1- Standard Registration of New Chemical Substances-- Information Requirements.docAppendix 2- Simplified Registration of New Chemical Substances-- Information Requirements.docAppendix 3- Small Quantity Registration of New Chemical Substances-- Information Requirements.doc
