Article 1
These Standards are determined pursuant to Article 20, Paragraph 2, Article 22, Paragraphs 2 and 3, and Article 23, Paragraph 2 of the Air Pollution Control Act. Article 2
Terms and symbols used in these Standards are defined as follows:-9I."ng" means nanogram, equivalent to 10 grams.II."Nm3 ” means a cubic meter at a temperature of 273 K and a pressure of 1 atmosphere.III."ppm" means parts per million.IV."C" means pollutant concentration corrected to Standard Oxygen Basis, measured in ng-TEQ/Nm3 .V."Q" means emission quantity corrected to Basic Oxygen Standard, measured in Nm3/min.VI.“Cs” means measured pollutant concentration based on test method, not corrected to Standard Oxygen Basis, measured in ng-TEQ/Nm3.VII.“Os” means the actual measured oxygen concentration in emissions.VIII.“E, means the actual oxygen concentration of oxygen-enriched gases imported into incinerator.IX.“I-TEF" means the International Toxicity Equivalency Factor used internationally to calculate the toxicity weighting of dioxin concentrations.X.“TEQ" (Toxicity Equivalency Quantity of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin) means the method for calculating the toxicity weighting of dioxin concentrations.XI.“Continuous incineration facility" means a facility that is continuously operating 24 hours per day.XII.“Gas retention time" means the time gas is retained in the second combustion chamber (complete combustion).XIII.“Variable one-hour average" means the average of continuously fluctuating values during a single hour. Article 3
For matters not provided in these Standards, the regulations of other relevant standards shall apply. Article 4
These Standards shall apply to stack emissions from general waste incinerators (herein referred to as incinerators) in continuous operation and with a handling capacity of 10 tons/hour or more, or incinerators designed for a total handling capacity of 300 tons/day or more. The controlled pollutant items are dioxins (dioxins and furans).In the foregoing paragraph “handling capacity” means the maximum weight of waste fed into a single incinerator per hour (regardless of whether wet or dry). Total handling capacity means the sum of the handling capacities of all incinerators in a plant. Article 5
The dioxin emission standard value in these Standards is 0.1ng-TEQ/Nm3 .The concentrations of the standard values of the foregoing paragraph are expressed as Toxicity Equivalent (TEQ) The measured concentrations of all listed dioxin pollutants Table multiplied by their International Toxicity Equivalency Factor (I-TEF) shall be added up as a total. Sampling and testing shall be performed five or more times and take the arithmetic mean value of the three middle values after the data have been sorted from the largest to the smallest. Each sampling shall be done at intervals of more than one hour. Table International Toxicity Equivalency Factor.pdf
