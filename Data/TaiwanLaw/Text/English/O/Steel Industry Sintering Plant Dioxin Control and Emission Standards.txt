Article 1
These Standards are determined pursuant to Article 20, Paragraph 2, Article 22, Paragraphs 2 and 3, and Article 23, Paragraph 2 of the Air Pollution Control Act. Article 2
Terms and symbols used in these Standards are defined as follows:I."Dioxin" means polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans.II."I-TEF" means the International Toxicity Equivalency Factor used internationally to calculate the toxicity weighting of dioxin concentrations.III."TEQ" (Toxicity Equivalency Quantity of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin) means the method of calculating the toxicity weighting of dioxin concentrations.IV."Newly established sintering plant" means a sintering plant that was established on or after the date of promulgation of these Standards.V."Existing sintering plant" means a sintering plant that is already constructed or that is in the process of being constructed, for which project tender procedures have been completed, or if no tenders were invited, for which project contracts were issued and signed before the date of promulgation of these Standards. However, a sintering plant for which the dioxin emissions has increased by more than 10% of the annual allowable emissions as set forth in the operating permit due to the replacement or enlargement of relevant equipment shall be deemed a newly established sintering plant. Article 3
For matters not regulated in these Standards, the regulations of other relevant laws and regulations shall apply. Article 4
These Standards shall apply to emissions from the sintering machine smelting process in steel industry factories that use high temperatures to sinter a mixture of iron sands, coke and other ores into blocks. The controlled pollutant is dioxin. Article 5
The values determined by these Standards are as follows:┌────────────┬────────────┬────────┐│Pollution sources │Emission standard value │Effective Date│││(ng-TEQ/N m3)│ │├────────────┼────────────┼────────┤││2.0│January 1, 2006 ││Existing sintering plant├────────────┼────────┤││1.0│January 1, 2008 │├────────────┼────────────┼────────┤│Newly established │0.5│Date of││sintering plant││promulgation │└────────────┴────────────┴────────┘The concentrations of the standard values of the foregoing paragraph are expressed as TEQ. The measured concentrations listed in the following Table for dioxin pollutants multiplied by their I-TEF shall be calculated as a total. Sampling and testing shall be conducted more than three times and the arithmetic mean value shall be used. Each sampling shall be done at intervals greater than one hour.
