However, if an educational institution in Taiwan where an overseas Chinese student was studying considers their academic performance or conduct was unsatisfactory, or if the student seriously violated its regulations or was sentenced in criminal case proceedings, and therefore in accordance with the provisions of the regulations governing student awards and penalties had to discontinue their studies or forfeited their status as a registered student , the student is not permitted to re-apply to study in Taiwan.An overseas Chinese student is not permitted to change their status of being an overseas Chinese student while they are studying in Taiwan, unless permitted to do under the provisions of some other ordinance. Article 3
he term "overseas” used in Paragraph 1 of the previous article refers to countries or regions other than Taiwan, mainland China, Macao, and Hong Kong.The consecutive years of overseas residency referred to in Paragraph 1 of the previous article means calendar years in each of which an overseas Chinese student has not spent more than 120 days in Taiwan. When calculating the number of consecutive years spent overseas, if the initial or final year of the period is not a complete calendar year, any time spent in Taiwan in the initial or final year must not exceed 120 days. However, time that a person has spent in Taiwan is not subject to this restriction and is not counted when calculating how long they were in Taiwan in a particular year if in that period of time the overseas Chinese student has:1. attended an overseas youth technical training course conducted by the OCAC or a technical professional training program accredited by the central competent education administration authority;2. attended an activity held by the OCAC or by a government agency and recognized by the OCAC, or taken a Chinese language course provided by a Chinese language education institute which has been approved by the governing authority to recruit students overseas, and has spent a total period of less than two years undertaking such activities or courses;3. spent a total period of less than two years in Taiwan as an exchange student;4. spent a total period of less than two years undertaking an internship that they came to Taiwan to undertake with the approval of the designated central competent authority;5. returned to Taiwan to do military service and has been enlisted and served;6. stayed in Taiwan because they were unable to return to their country of residence because of war, some natural disaster, or a major outbreak of some infectious disease; or7. stayed in Taiwan because they were unable to return to their country of residence because of some other matter that the student was not responsible for and they have documentary evidence of this.Documentary evidence of the having obtained permanent or long-term residency status overseas referred to in the first paragraph of the previous article may include proof of having citizenship or permanent residency in the applicant’s country of residence, or having a Republic of China passport which officially records the person’s overseas Chinese status. Article 4
The standard way to calculate the period of continuous residency overseas referred to in Paragraph 1 of Article 2 is to calculate from the final date that overseas students can apply in the current year designated in the admission guidelines for overseas students. This does not apply, however, to applicants whose period of continuous residency overseas must be calculated using August 31 of the year of the application to meet the requirements set out in Article 2 and Article 3.An overseas Chinese student who makes an application to study in Taiwan, in accordance with the proviso set out in the previous paragraph shall complete and submit a written declaration regarding their overseas residency before their application may then be processed. After they have been allocated a place at an educational institution in Taiwan in the OCAC shall review their actual residency circumstances in the period between the final date for enrollment and August 31 of the same year. If the period spent overseas does not satisfy the provisions of Article 2 and Article 3, then the student shall have their enrollment eligibility revoked.If an overseas Chinese student who independently returned to Taiwan makes an application in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 1 of Article 9, the length of continuous residency overseas referred to in Paragraph 1 of Article 2 is calculated from the date of their most recent arrival in Taiwan. People who independently undertook studying in Taiwan and are applying for assistance with procedures to arrange an admission in accordance with Paragraph 5 of Article 9, the period of overseas residency is calculated from the date of their most recent arrival in Taiwan since beginning their independently arranged study. Article 5
