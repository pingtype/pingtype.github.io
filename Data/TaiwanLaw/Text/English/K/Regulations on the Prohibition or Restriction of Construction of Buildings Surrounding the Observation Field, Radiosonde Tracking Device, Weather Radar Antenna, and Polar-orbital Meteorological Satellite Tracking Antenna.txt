This Regulations is enacted in accordance with the terms in Paragraph 2 of Article 13, Meteorological Act. Article 2
The observation field, radiosonde tracking device, weather radar antenna, and polar-orbital meteorological satellite tracking antenna stated in this Regulations are limited to those installed within the domain of the Central Weather Bureau (hereinafter referred to as CWB) and its affiliated organizations. Article 3
The restricted height of buildings surrounding an observation field(enclosure) shall be measured from the center of that enclosure, and the height of the highest part of a building shall not be higher than half the distance between that building and the enclosure center. Article 4
The restricted height of buildings surrounding a radiosonde tracking device shall be measured from the center of the pedestal bottom of that tracking antenna, the highest part of a building should be under an elevation of three-degrees (see attached Sketch 1) . Article 5
The restricted height of buildings surrounding a weather radar antenna shall be as followsï¼š1.With the center of the pedestal bottom of a weather radar antenna as the measuring center, the highest part of abuilding within a radius of one hundred and eighty-six (186) meters, shall be under the horizon of the pedestal bottom.2.With the center of the pedestal bottom of a weather radar antenna as the measuring center, the highest part of abuilding within the circular belt of an inner radius of one hundred and eighty-six (186) meters and an outer radius of four hundred and ninety-eight (498) meters, shall be under an elevation angle of 0.5 degrees (see attached Sketch 2) . Article 6

To ensure the accuracy and completeness of the observed data sourcing from the observation field, radiosonde tracking device, weather radar antenna, and polar-orbital meteorological satellite tracking antenna, the CWB may, when necessary, draw a specific areas to restrict the construction of buildings.To the aforementioned restriction of construction areas and height, the CWB shall draw a geomorphological map in accordance with the scale of the local urban plan or regional plan; for areas without an urban plan or regional plan, draw a geomorphological map or a plan map of scale 1/50,000, so that the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (hereinafter referred to as MOTC)can consult with the Ministry of Interior (hereinafter referred to as MOI)and relatedgovernment agencies for approval, and so the MOI can advise the relevant local government to announce and become effective. Article 8
When a local government is dealing with the constructer applying for a construction within the announced area of restriction of construction, the permitted height of a building shall be in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 through Article 6.To those existing buildings or other obstructions already higher than the limited height, the local government may advise the owner to demolish the over-height portion.As to the demolition of the preceding over-height buildings and/or obstructions have been existing before the announcement of restriction of construction height in accordance with this Regulations, the CWB shall compensate the owner in accordance with the relevant regulations of compensation enacted by the local government. Article 9
When an observation field, a radiosonde tracking device, a weather radar antenna, or a polar-orbital meteorological satellite tracking antenna is abolished, the CWB shall make a report to the MOTC, so that the MOTC can turn to advise the related local government, in care of the MOI, to make an abolishment announcement and with copy to the relevant agencies. Article 10
For an area with an urban planning which would like to conduct a restriction of construction of buildings in accordance with this Regulations, the local government shall state the matters of or concerning the restriction of construction of buildings in the report of the urban planning, and plot the boundary and domain of restriction of buildings on the map of the urban planning, and go through the formalities of approval and promulgation in accordance with the Urban Planning Act and/or its relevant regulations.The same actions shall be taken when terminate the restriction of buildings. Article 11
This Regulations shall become effective on the date of promulgation.
