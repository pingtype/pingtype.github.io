While labors performing checking, repair of electric circuit and other works on live wires not wearing insulated protective gear, or not employing tools for live wire operation or other similar tools, not employing insulated work platform and other installation on works performed on high voltage circuit, or put laborâ€™s body, the electrical conductive tools and materials he is using in contact or near electric circuit or object carrying electricity that may electrify the labor. Article 5
Following circumstances are potentials of imminent danger under the category of collapsing and caving:1. Scaffolding is not firmly attached to a stable structure within 5.5 meters in vertical direction and within 7.5 meters in horizontal direction.2. Where excavation depth exceeds 1.5 meters in an open cut site, or ground surface has potential of cave-in, rock sliding, shoring, anti-circulation pilings, slurry walls, bank protection or protective net is not installed.3. Where structure support, rock bolt, or gunite support is not built, and loose stones are not removed where potential of stone falling or land sliding exists in tunnel or trench. When shoring, protective net, loose stone removal or bank protective measures is not in place at areas near and around the entrance or exit of tunnel and trench where landslide and rockslide are of potential threats. The land foundation is soft at areas near and around the entrance or exit of tunnel and trench where rebar protective measures is not built to provide necessary protection.4. Area around the base of form support which may induce water retention which causes site platform becomes soft, or soft site platform has not been enforced to increase its loading capacity. Article 6
Following circumstances are potentials of imminent danger under the category of fire and explosion:1. When performing welding, forging, or use of open flame, or has the potential to produce sparkles on pipes, storage trough, tank and other storage container containing harmful materials, oil and grease, combustible dust and other dangerous materials, the contents have not been removed before-hand and cleared of danger.2. Examination of the density of vapor containing inflammable liquid or that of stationary combustible gases has not been performed prior to the beginning of work at workplace with potential of fire and explosion caused by the aforementioned vapor or gases. When the density of inflammable liquid or combustible gases reaches within 30% of its safety limit, labors have not been evacuated immediately to safety and the use of fire and of machines that may ignite have not all put into stop.3. Ventilation, exhaustion, dust-cleaning, de-static and other necessary installations have not been installed at workplaces where potential of fire and explosion caused by storing of vapor with inflammable liquid, combustible gases and dust exist.4. While performing improvement, repair, cleaning, removal on installations containing chemicals and peripherals of its kind where hazardous materials leakage may endanger labors and no assigned personnel to set double control on valves or switches or to set blind boards.5. No proper drainage system and other necessary measures to prevent explosion caused by vapor at buildings with installations for processing melted materials at high temperature and workplaces processing or disposing high temperature slag.6. Using pure oxygen for air circulation in confined workplaces. Article 7
Following circumstances are potentials of imminent danger under the category of intoxication and oxygen deficiency:1. Fresh air supply mask is not provided to labors or the proper use of the mask is not enforced at workplaces where organic solvent or its mixture have previously stored, poorly ventilated workplace, or workplaces located inside a storage trough where leakage-proof installation, local exhaustion installation or air exchange installation for the entire workplace has not been installed.2.
