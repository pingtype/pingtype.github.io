The court may cancel a ruling designating a Technical Examination Officer or designate another Technical Examination Officer to perform duties, if necessary. Article 18
Statements made by a Technical Examination Officer may not be directly admitted as evidence for the purpose of finding on the facts to be established.ã€€The parties shall still discharge their burden of proof by presenting evidence with respect to the facts to be established in the action according to the evidence procedure set forth in the applicable litigation laws, without directly adducing the statements of a Technical Examination Officer as evidence. Article 19
The court may, in response to a motion for an order of submission of evidence, order the holder of the relevant document or object for inspection to state his opinion.ã€€If the holder raises a defense on the basis of trade secret, the court may order such holder to provide a preliminary showing, then make a determination after the other party states its opinion on, the type, nature and scope of the secret, and the specific disadvantages to arise out of disclosure as well as the scope of such disadvantages.Where necessary, the court may also order the holder to submit evidence in a private manner for its deliberation.Where the court deems it necessary to hear the opinion of a related party to the action, disclosure will be made to the litigious agent in principle unless the objective can hardly be achieved without the disclosure made to a party to the action itself, and the court may instruct the holder to file a motion for a confidentiality preservation order to be issued to the party to whom disclosure is made.The court shall determine whether the holder of evidence has a valid reason for refusing to furnish the relevant document or object for inspection or not, by deliberating on the connection between the trade secret and fact to be established, availability of an alternative evidentiary method or requirement on presumption of facts, possibility of moving for a confidentiality preservation order, and other circumstances. Article 19-1
The infringed party must make a preliminary showing of the infringement or high likelihood of infringement of its trade secrets if it is to claim according to Paragraph 2, Article 10-1 of the Act that the court may, subject to the circumstances, find its preliminary showing true.Where the other party denies the claim of which a preliminary showing has been made under the preceding paragraph, the court shall order it to raise a specific defense in regard to its denial within a prescribed time limit.Where the other party fails without good cause to raise a defense within the prescribed time limit or to raise a specific defense, the court shall accord parties an opportunity to present their arguments on the dispute over the truthfulness of the allegation before it may find the allegation of which the infringed party has made a preliminary showing true. Article 20
A party or a third party shall pay attention to the following when it files a motion for a confidentiality preservation order pursuant to Article 12 of the Act:1. The person specified in the motion to be subject to the confidentiality preservation order shall be a natural person. The personal domicile or residence of the natural person shall also be specified in the motion.2. The trade secret specified in the motion to be protected by the order may be disclosed by way of indirect adduction, without a disclosure of the contents of the trade secret, to enable the court to determine whether the requirements for the establishment of trade secret are satisfied or not.The above-mentioned motion shall expressly state the following required facts:1. the contents of the pleadings or evidence involves the trade secret of a party or a third party;2. that it is necessary to impose restrictions on the disclosure or use of the trade secret since disclosure or use of the trade secret for a purpose other than the purpose of the legal proceeding in question is likely to hinder the business activity which the party or third party engages in based on such trade secret; and3. that as of the motion for the confidentiality preservation order, the person to be subject to the order has not obtained the trade secret by ways other than the perusal of the pleadings or investigation of the evidence.Prosecutors conducting a public complaint and civil servants intervening in an action are under an obligation of confidentiality in their public duties thus not persons to be subject to a confidentiality preservation order. Article 21
Persons to be subject to a confidentiality preservation order are limited to those with access to the trade secret by virtue of the principal case.ã€€If the other party has retained a litigious agent, such litigious agent is advisable to be included as a person subject to a confidentiality preservation order.The court may request both parties to make a determination through negotiation, before rendering the above ruling. Article 22
It is not advisable that the document or object containing a trade secret be incorporated as an attachment to a motion.ã€€Such document or object shall be separately submitted to court, and will be returned upon the conclusion of trial or where retention is no longer necessary; it may not be enclosed to the dossier. Article 23
The court may question the party concerned, person to be subject to the confidentiality preservation order, or any related party, or otherwise investigate the evidence as necessary, before ruling on a motion for a confidentiality preservation order. Article 24
The court may stay the trial of the portion of a principal case concerning a trade secret prior to its ruling on the motion for a confidentiality preservation order becoming final. Article 25
The court shall grant by ruling a motion for a confidentiality preservation order if it deems such motion justified, otherwise, it shall dismiss the motion.The trade secret in question shall not be disclosed in the above ruling.ã€€It is advisable that the trade secret subject to protection be confirmed in the syllabus and reasons of the ruling by way of indirect adduction. Article 26
The original copy of a court ruling on a motion for a confidentiality preservation order shall be retained together with the document containing the trade secret.The authenticated copies of a court ruling on a motion for a confidentiality preservation order shall not attach any document containing a trade secret. Article 27
A confidentiality preservation order shall become effective against the opposing party upon being served on such party.ã€€The court may not effectuate service by constructive notice of a confidentiality preservation order.The court may direct the parties in its notice for negotiation under Paragraph 2, Article 21 to agree for the person subject to the confidentiality preservation order to collect the order from court.A person subject to a confidentiality preservation order shall report to court any change of his domicile or residence. Article 28
Where a party to an intellectual property civil or criminal action claims or defends that an intellectual property right shall be cancelled or revoked, thereby affecting the outcome of the civil or criminal adjudication, the court shall determine on such claim or argument in the reasons of its judgment, without directly concluding such claim or argument is inadmissible on the grounds that the intellectual property right has not been cancelled or revoked; nor shall the court rule to suspend the legal proceedings on the grounds that the administrative proceeding initiated in connection with the disputed issue has not concluded.The same facts and evidence concerning whether an intellectual property right shall be cancelled or revoked may no longer be asserted in an intellectual property civil proceeding if it has been conclusively decided in an administrative proceeding that the cancellation or invalidation is not established, or if the application for invalidation has been time-barred, or if there are other factors by law prohibiting assertion in an administrative proceeding. Article 29
The court shall overrule any independent action filed by a party to an intellectual property civil action, any concurrent claim by the party in the civil action for a judgment establishing the legal relationship against the adverse party, or any counter-claim by said party, with respect to the disputed issue over the validity of an intellectual property right or over whether an intellectual property right shall be cancelled or revoked, due to inconsistency with the purpose of Article 16 of the Act. Article 30
Where a party or a third party has, while an intellectual property civil action is pending, initiated an administrative action with respect to the cancellation or revocation of the same intellectual property right, the court may designate the date for a court session taking into account the progress of the administrative action and opinions of the parties, for determining whether the intellectual property right shall be cancelled or revoked.It is advisable that the opinion of the competent intellectual property authority which has been ordered to intervene in a civil action under the preceding paragraph pursuant to Paragraph 1, Article 17 of the Act be sought for the purpose of designation of the date for a court session; negotiation may be conducted with both parties and the intervening party for the arrangement of a trial plan, where necessary.The court may request evidentiary information from the competent intellectual property authority and its superior appeal authority ex officio where necessary, if in the civil action mentioned in the first paragraph it is unable to determine by the evidence presented by the parties whether an intellectual property right shall be cancelled or revoked. Article 31
The court shall make a determination based on the information obtained from evidence presented by the parties and on investigation which it conducts ex officio if a party claims or defends in an intellectual property civil action that an intellectual property right shall be cancelled or revoked thereby affecting the outcome of the adjudication.ã€€Notwithstanding, where necessary, the court may order the competent intellectual property authority to intervene in the action pursuant to Paragraph 1, Article 17 of the Act for such authority to express its opinion on the disputed issue involving expertise or legal principles.The competent intellectual property authority intervening in an action pursuant to the preceding paragraph may independently file the means of attack and defense with respect only to whether the intellectual property right shall be cancelled or revoked. Article 32
Where a party to a civil action over patent infringement claims or defends that the patent right shall be cancelled and where the patent right holder has applied to the competent intellectual property authority for amendment to the scope of patent claim, an appropriate date for a court session shall be designated taking into account the extent to which the amendment has proceeded and upon consultation with both parties, except where trial and adjudication of the principal case may directly proceed if the amendment application obviously shall not be granted or if the amended scope of claim, once approved, does not constitute an infringement of right. Article 33
It is advisable that the court overrule pursuant to Paragraph 2, Article 196 of the Code of Civil Procedure an intellectual property civil action over whether an intellectual property right shall be cancelled or revoked, if conclusion of the action is impeded by a party's attempt to defer the proceeding or by a party's delay in filing its means of attack and defense out of gross negligence.Unless otherwise provided by law, the means of attack and defense on whether an intellectual property right shall be cancelled or revoked may no longer be claimed or raised in defense in the appeal instance or in oral argument after the preparatory proceeding, if such means has not been asserted or defended in the first instance or in any preparatory proceeding conducted. Article 34
Where in a final judgment of an intellectual property civil action that substantively found on the issue as to whether an intellectual property right shall be cancelled or revoked, if in other actions concerning whether the same intellectual property right shall be cancelled or revoked, the same party raises a claim or defense contrary to the gist of the final judgment on the basis of the same basic facts, the court shall make its determination by deliberating on the relevant circumstances such as whether the above final judgment is obviously contrary to the laws and regulations, whether new litigation information emerges that may affect the outcome of the judgment, and the principle of good faith. Article 35
No trial concerning the amount of damage in a civil action over the infringement of an intellectual property right shall be conducted until after the argument on whether the alleged infringement is established or not, unless the court deems advance or contemporaneous debate necessary over the content of the damage. Article 36
Where no action is initiated, a motion under Paragraph 1, Article 22 of the Act shall be filed with the court where the action shall be pending; after an action is initiated, such motion shall be filed with the court where the principal case is pending; provided, however, the motion shall be filed with the court of first instance where the action is pending if the principal case is pending before the Supreme Court.The above motion, if in a civil action supplemental to a criminal action, shall be filed with the court entertaining such civil action supplemental to a criminal action. Article 37
An applicant seeking an injunction maintaining the temporary status quo of a disputed legal relation involving intellectual property must provide a preliminary showing with regard to the existence of such legal relation and the need to maintain the temporary status quo.ã€€The court shall dismiss the application if the preliminary showing is insufficient, without allowing the provision of a bond, whether in lieu of preliminary showing or supplementing the above-mentioned insufficiency.The court may still order the applicant having made the above preliminary showing to provide an adequate bond in its ruling on an injunction maintaining the temporary status quo.The court reviewing an application for maintaining the temporary status quo shall, with respect to the necessity of preservation, deliberate on the likelihood of success of the applicant in the principal case in the future, whether the granting or rejection of the application will cause irreparable harm to the applicant or opposing party, balance on the degree of damage to both parties, and impact on public interest.With respect to the likelihood of success in the principal case in the future mentioned above, the court shall rule against the intellectual property right holder if there is high probability of cancellation or revocation when a party claims or defends, with convincing evidence, that the intellectual property right shall be cancelled or revoked. Article 38
Before an injunction maintaining the temporary status quo is granted, the court shall accord the opposing party an opportunity to state its opinion, unless the applicant asserts and is able to provide evidence to substantiate its assertion that there is special circumstance that shall restrict the opposing party from being notified before the injunction is issued, and the court deems such assertion appropriate.The court will determine the method by which to proceed with the injunction maintaining the temporary status quo according to the circumstances concerned, without being bound by the motion of the applicant, provided the method shall be limited to a feasible one neither contrary to the purpose of the injunction nor beyond the necessary extent. Article 39
The court revoking an injunction to maintain the temporary status quo upon motion or ex officio pursuant to Paragraph 5, Article 22 of the Act shall ascertain from the applicant and other courts whether an action has been initiated or not. Article 40
In an administrative action concerning cancellation or revocation of a registered trademark or patent, the court shall still take into account any new evidence submitted on the same grounds for the cancellation or revocation prior to the end of oral argument, provided the court may, pursuant to Article 132 of the Code of Administrative Procedure applying Paragraph 2, Article 196 of the Code of Civil Procedure mutatis mutandis, dismiss new evidence produced, if the conclusion of the action is impeded by the party's attempt to defer the proceeding or its failure, out of gross negligence, to follow the progress of the legal proceeding by presenting new evidence within an appropriate period prior to the end of oral argument.The competent intellectual property authority may request the court to allow the authority an adequate time for preparing any defense pleadings which the authority may be required by Paragraph 2, Article 33 of the Act to submit in response to the above-mentioned new evidence. Article 41
An intellectual property civil or criminal appeal and an intellectual property administrative action being based on the same basic facts and pending concurrently or successively at the Intellectual Property Court may be handled by the same independent or commissioned judge; the same shall apply where the former action is concluded. Article 42
These adjudication rules shall come into force as of the date the Act comes into force.
