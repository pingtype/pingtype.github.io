The foregoing shall also apply to the circumstance where reduction of time-limits for tendering referred to in Article 9 is overlapping. Article 5

Where an entity cancels or suspends a tendering procedure prior to the closing of tendering period and then re-tenders or resumes the procedure within 6 months without making substantial changes in the tender documentation, the tendering period for the re-tendering or resumed procedure may, by taking due account of the number of days elapsed from publication of the notice or invitation to tender until the cancellation or suspension of the tendering procedure, be shorter than that originally specified, provided that this tendering period shall not be less than 3 days for procurement of a value not reaching the threshold for publication, and 7 days for procurement of a value reaching the threshold for publication.Where an entity cannot proceed with the opening of tenders, nullifies the tender, revokes the contract award or rescinds the contract after the closing of tendering period, and re-tenders within 3 months thereafter without making substantial changes in the tender documentation, the provision set out in the preceding paragraph shall apply mutatis mutandis. Article 9

Where the tendering period or the time-limit for receipt of documents prescribed in this Standards is stated to be calculated from the date of publication of the notice or invitation to tender, the date shall be calculated as one day.With respect to the tendering period or the time-limit for receipt of documents referred to in the preceding paragraph, if the closing date for receipt of tenders or documents specified in the tender documentation expires at a time corresponding to the close of business on that day, it shall be counted as one day.
