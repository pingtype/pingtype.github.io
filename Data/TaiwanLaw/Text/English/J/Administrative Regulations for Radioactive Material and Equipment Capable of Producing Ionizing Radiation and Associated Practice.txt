Section I General PrinciplesArticle 1　 The Regulations are prescribed in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 29.5 of the Ionizing Radiation Protection Act (hereinafter referred to as "this Act").Article 2　 The definitions for terms used in the Regulations are as follows:1.Sealed radioactive material refers to radioactive material placed in a sealed container sufficient to provide isolation from the outside under normal use.2.Modification refers to any one of the following situations involving radioactive material, equipment capable of producing ionizing radiation or the workplace:(1)a change in the direction of primary radiation beam of sealed radioactive material or equipment capable of producing ionizing radiation;(2)an increase in the activity of sealed radioactive material;(3)an increase in the nominal voltage of an X-ray unit;(4)an increase in the accelerating voltage of an accelerator;(5)a change in the radiation protective shielding; or(6)other situations as designated by the Competent Authority.3.Labeling refers to the process of combining a radioactive nuclide with another material to form a radioactive compound.4.Cabinet refers to a separate cabinet, not a part of a building, originally designed or constructed with appropriate shielding that, when in use, prevents entry by personnel and in which radioactive material or equipment capable of producing ionizing radiation is placed.5.High-level radiation facility refers to a facility characterized by one of the following:(1)equipment capable of producing ionizing radiation with a rated accelerating voltage of greater than 30 MV(2)equipment capable of producing ionizing radiation with a particle energy rating of greater than 30 MeV; or(3)the use of sealed radioactive material with an activity of greater than 1,000 TBq.6.Transit refers to a stop-over period with definite time parameters for goods not yet unloaded being shipped on the same aircraft or means of transportation that are to enter another country or area via Taiwan air or sea ports. 7.Transshipment en route refers to a stop-over period with definite time parameters for unloaded goods being shipped on the same or other aircraft or means of transportation that are to enter another country or area via Taiwan air or sea ports.8.Surface contaminated object (SCO) refers to a solid substance that, itself not radioactive, has been contaminated on the surface by a radioactive material, but this does not include radioactive waste.Article 3　 There are five types of sealed radioactive material categorized by their degree of potential detriment against human health and environment as listed in Table I.Table I：Categories of Sealed Radioactive Material.doc
