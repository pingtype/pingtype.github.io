But if the previous year sales of a brand by the vehicle entity were less than 300 units and the brand’s world annual production is less than 10,000 units, a proposal for its fuel economy improvement may be submitted and being approved by the central competent authority to execute its improvement project announced by the central competent authority, and not applicable for the average fuel economy limits prescribed herein.┌────────────────┬─────────────┐│Class of vehicle reference mass │Average fuel economy││(kg) │limits (km/liter)│├────────────────┼─────────────┤│Below 850│19.2 │├────────────────┼─────────────┤│Over 850 to 965│18.2 │├────────────────┼─────────────┤│Over 1080 to 1190│16.6 │├────────────────┼─────────────┤│Over 1190 to 1305│15.7 │├────────────────┼─────────────┤│Over 1305 to 1420│15.0 │├────────────────┼─────────────┤│Over 1420 to 1530│14.1 │├────────────────┼─────────────┤│Over 1530 to 1640│13.3 │├────────────────┼─────────────┤│Over 1640 to 1760│12.5 │├────────────────┼─────────────┤│Over 1760 to 1870│11.8 │├────────────────┼─────────────┤│Over 1870 to 1980│11.2 │├────────────────┼─────────────┤│Over 1980 to 2100│10.5 │├────────────────┼─────────────┤│Over 2100 to 2210│9.7│├────────────────┼─────────────┤│Over 2210 to 2380│9.3│├────────────────┼─────────────┤│Over 2380 to 2610│8.4│├────────────────┼─────────────┤│Over 2610│7.2│└────────────────┴─────────────┘4.2.3 The average fuel economy value and average fuel economy target values prescribed in 4.2.1 shall be calculated by using the following formula:4.2.3.1 Average fuel economy value:NΣVi1Average Fuel Economy Value (km/liter) ＝────NViΣ──1FCii: manufactured or imported vehicle type’s sequence number.FCi: fuel economy test value (km/liter) for manufactured or imported vehicle type i.Vi: sales number (units) of manufactured or imported vehicle type i.4.2.3.2 Average fuel economy target value:NΣVi1Average Fuel Economy Target Value (km/liter) ＝────NViΣ──1Tii: manufactured or imported vehicle type’s sequence number.Ti: average fuel economy limit (km/liter) of the manufactured or imported vehicle type i in accordance with 4.2.2 of this Article.Vi: sales number (units) of manufactured or imported vehicle type i.4.2.4 The average fuel economy values for each individual manufacturer shall be calculated by the central competent authority by using the fuel economy test values registered by each individual manufacturer; different manufacturers may be combined for their average fuel economy value calculation, if being approved by the central competent authority.4.2.5 Vehicle entities pursued 4.2.4 may consent to end their combined calculation of average fuel economy value; their previous earned credits from exceed the required target value may continue to be used by the assigned manufacturer through agreement; the deficiency from under their target value shall be managed in accordance with 4.2.8 of this Article.4.2.6 The same vehicle entity manufactured or imported different brands of vehicles, may calculate the fuel economy values separately for different brands, if being approved by the central competent authority.4.2.7 Vehicle entities with annual sales number over 100 units or values over 100 million NT dollars being approved by the central competent authority may use their annual sales number for the calculation of average fuel economy value. If the calculated average fuel economy is over the target value, the earned credits may be accumulated for the calculation of next 3 year’s average fuel economy values.4.2.8 For vehicle entities mentioned in the previous paragraph 4.2.7, if their calculated fuel economy values are under their required target values at specific year, their subsequent market sold vehicles must comply with the average fuel economy limits being defined by 4.2.2 of this Article until the difference of calculated and target values are being complemented or acquired from other entities’ credits to regain their average fuel economy calculation by their annual sales numbers.4.2.9 Electric vehicle (sedans and station wagons) sold by the vehicle entity, its fuel economy test value may be multiplied by 2.5 as the fuel economy value and being used in the average fuel economy calculation; the fuel economy test value for electric vehicle shall be rated by the competent authority.4.3 The fuel economy standards listed in Article 6 are applicable to vehicles with importer provided the listing of US certificate being classified as LDT model or with the EU certificate being classified as M1G model.
