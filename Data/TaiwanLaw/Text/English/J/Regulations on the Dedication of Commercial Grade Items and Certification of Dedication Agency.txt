Article 1
These Regulations are enacted pursuant to Article 16 of the Nuclear Reactor Facilities Regulation Act. Article 2
The terminology used in these Regulations shall be respectively defined as follows: 1.Critical Characteristics: Essential characteristics such as design, materials, functions of the Nuclear Grade Item which can be demonstrated through inspections, tests and/or analysis, etc. to provide reasonable assurance that the item can indeed perform its intended safety functions.2.Commercial Grade Item: An item not designed nor fabricated in accordance with the Nuclear Grade Item’s unique specifications.3.Dedicated Commercial Grade Item: A Commercial Grade Item demonstrated through specific dedication procedures whose characteristics are equivalent to the Critical Characteristics of the corresponding Nuclear Grade Item.4.Technical Evaluation: The evaluation process for establishing the Critical Characteristics and Acceptance Criteria in accordance with the item’s functional requirements and for confirming that all relevant requirements are specified in detail in the item’s procurement document.5.Dedication: The operation through the Technical Evaluation and the Acceptance Procedure to verify that the Commercial Grade Item’s characteristics are equivalent to the Critical Characteristics of the corresponding Nuclear Grade Item.6.Acceptance: The approach of the provision of reasonable assurance based on objective evidence that the Commercial Grade Item received is indeed the corresponding Dedicated Commercial Grade Item.7.Acceptance Criteria: Acceptance standard for an Item’s dedication results, established in accordance with the intended functional requirements for the Nuclear Grade Item.8.Environmental Qualification Test: A test performed to dedicate the characteristics of the randomly selected items from the same manufacturing batch, and under the simulated actual environmental conditions. The test results must assure that the same batch of items will be suitable for the actual environmental conditions. The main actual environmental conditions to be simulated shall include temperature, pressure, humidity, radiation and chemical effect, etc.9.Failure Modes and Effects Analysis: The evaluation of an item’s failure mechanism and its effect on the intended safety functions.10.Safety Functions: Those functions, as listed in the following, of a system, structure, or component of a nuclear reactor facility during normal service conditions, anticipated abnormal events, design basis accidents, external events, and natural phenomena must be assured.(1)The integrity of the reactor coolant pressure boundary,(2)The capability to shut down the reactor and to maintain its safe shutdown conditions, and (3)The capability to prevent or mitigate the consequences of accidents that could result in potential offsite radiation exposures exceeding the prescribed specific limits.11.International Nuclear Procurement Quality Assurance Organization: A non-profit international organization represented by international nuclear utilities operating nuclear power plants to conduct joint audits on dedicated commercial grade item suppliers or dedication agencies in accordance with Quality Assurance Criteria and Quality Assurance Program for nuclear power plants.12.Approved Suppliers List: A list established by the licensee after the licensee has reviewed the dedicated commercial grade item suppliers or dedication agencies that are qualified through joint audits by International Nuclear Procurement Quality Assurance Organization.13.Safety Hazard: Degradation of the safety functions to the structures, systems, and components of a nuclear facility that has caused significant reduction of protection to public health and safety. Article 3
The Licensee is subject to the inspections by the Regulatory Authority for the regulation of the Commercial Grade Item dedication, and is responsible for the following: 1.Establishing plan(s) and procedure(s) for the dedication of Commercial Grade Items,2.Conducting technical evaluation and establishing acceptance criteria,3.Checking and confirming the suitability of the dedication procedures whether the dedication is conducted by the Licensee or by the Licensee’s certified dedication agency.The Licensee shall check and confirm the reliability and safety of the Dedicated Commercial Grade Item used in nuclear safety-related applications, and 4.The documentation control of the Dedicated Commercial Grade Item. Article 4
The licensee can directly procure Dedicated Commercial Grade Items or dedication services from suppliers in the Approved Suppliers List but the licensee shall be responsible for executing the following subject to inspection by the Regulatory Authority:1.Conforming that the Commercial Grade Item procured from a supplier in the Approved Suppliers List has Critical Characteristics equivalent to, and can be used the same as, the corresponding Nuclear Grade Item.2.Conforming that the dedication implemented by the Commercial Grade Item Dedication Agency in Approved Suppliers List is in accordance with the dedication procedure(s).3.Reviewing and updating the Approved Suppliers List every year and keeping the related documentations until the nuclear reactor facility is decommissioned. Article 5
The Commercial Grade Item Dedication Agency (hereinafter as Dedication Agency) is responsible for the following: 1.Establishing Commercial Grade Item dedication procedure(s) and quality assurance program, and accepting inspection or auditing from the Licensee and the Regulatory Authority.2.Accepting a Licensee’s order to provide technical evaluation and acceptance criteria.3.Accepting order from and being responsible to a Licensee or Commercial Grade Item supplier to conduct dedication in accordance with the procurement document concurred by the Licensee.4.Effective control of the Commercial Grade Item’s dedication documentation. Article 5-1
Dedicated commercial grade items shall not apply to fuel assemblies, control rod assemblies, and reactor coolant pressure boundary components. Article 6
Both the Dedication Agency and the Licensee shall be responsible to file Attachment I to report the abnormality of the Dedicated Commercial Grade Item to the Regulatory Authority within one month when defect or unsuitable condition has been found on a Dedicated Commercial Grade Item.
