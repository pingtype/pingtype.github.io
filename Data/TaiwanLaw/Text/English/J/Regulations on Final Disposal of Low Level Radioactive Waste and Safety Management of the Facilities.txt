Chapter 1General PrinciplesArticle 1　 These Regulations are enacted pursuant to Article 21 of the Nuclear Materials and Radioactive Waste Management Act.Article 2　 The terms used in these Regulations are defined as follows:1.Solidifying & Packing: refers to transforming the waste into stable solidified waste and encapsulating them into the containers, so as to making the operation of waste packages suitable for loading, unloading, transportation, storage, and disposal.2.Leaching index: refers to the index of radioactive nuclides’ leaching from the solidified waste.3.Final disposal facilities of low level waste (hereinafter shortened as “low level disposal facilities”): refer to the lands, buildings, structures, and equipments used to dispose the low level waste.4.Multiple barrier: refers to the combination of solidified waste, containers, buffering and backfill materials, engineering structures, and stratums as well as natural barriers used by the radioactive waste disposal facilities of to delay the leaching, leakage, and migration of the radioactive nuclides.5.Disposal control area: refers to the surface and underground space within the range of the disposal facilities of radioactive waste. Permanent monuments or markers shall be set to indicate the borderlines of the disposal control area.6.High-Integrity Container: refers to the low level waste container which can maintain its structural integrity and prevent the radionuclide release in at least three hundred years.Chapter 2Requirements on Final Disposal of Low level WasteArticle 3　 According to the concentration of the radioactive nuclides, low level waste is classified as follows:1.Class A waste: refers to the low level waste the concentration of nuclides of which is not higher than 1/10 of the concentration value in the Annexed Table 1 and not higher than the concentration value in the column 1 of the Annexed Table 2, or the nuclides contained in which are not listed in Annexed Tables 1 and 2.2.Class B waste: refers to the low level waste the concentration of nuclides of which is higher than 1/10 of the value listed in the column 1 and not higher than that listed in the column 2 of the Annexed Table 2.3.Class C waste: refers to the low level waste the concentration of nuclides of which is higher than 1/10 and not higher than the value in the Annexed Table 1, or higher than the value listed in the column 2 but not higher than that listed in the column 3 of the Annexed Table 2.4.Greater than Class C waste: refers to the low level waste the concentration of nuclides of which is higher than the value in the Annexed Table 1, or higher than the value in the column 3 of the Annexed Table 2.Annexed Table 1：Concentration Value of Single Long-lived Nuclides.docAnnexed Table 2：Concentration Values of Single Short-lived Nuclides.doc
