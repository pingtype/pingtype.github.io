Article 1
This Standard is prescribed in accordance with the provisions of Article 17 of the Act Governing Food Sanitation. Article 2
The name of the chemical is indicated as nitrous oxide, dinitrogenmonoxide or nitrogen oxide; the formula of the chemical is indicated as N2O, and its molecular weight is 44.01. Article 3
Nitrous oxide to be used in food shall meet the requirements according to the following standards and tests：┌───────────┬──────────────────┐│Item│Standards and tests│├───────────┼──────────────────┤│Assay	 │Not less than 97% (v/v) │├───────────┼──────────────────┤│Description│Colourless, odourless gas│├───────────┼──────────────────┤│Solubility│1 volume dissolves in 1.5 volumes of││ │water (20℃, 760 mm Hg) │├───────────┼──────────────────┤│Flame test│A glowing splinter of wood in ││ │contact with nitrous oxide bursts││ │into flame (distinction from││ │nitrogen).│├───────────┼──────────────────┤│Pyrogallol test │Collect about 100 mL of the gas││ │under test in a 100-mL tube fitted││ │at the top with a stopcock. Open the││ │stopcock, and quickly add a freshly ││ │prepared solution of 500 mg of││ │pyrogallol in 2 mL of water and a││ │freshly prepared solution of 12 g of││ │potassium hydroxide in 8 mL of││ │water. Immediately close the││ │stopcock and mix. The gas is not ││ │absorbed and the solution does not││ │become brown(distinction from ││ │oxygen). │├───────────┼──────────────────┤│Carbon monoxide │Not more than 10 μL/L│├───────────┼──────────────────┤│Nitric oxide and│Not more than 5 μL/L││nitrogen dioxide││├───────────┼──────────────────┤│Halogens and hydrogen │Not more than 5 μL/L││sulfide││├───────────┼──────────────────┤│Arsine and phosphine│Pass 10.0 L at a rate of 1.0 L/min││ │through a glass tube packed with ││ │lead acetate TS on cotton wool and a││ │gas distribution head of the domed, ││ │sintered type, of porosity 100, into││ │a tube of about 2.5 cm internal││ │diameter, containing 5 mL of Silver ││ │DDC/Quinoline TS, the domed head ││ │being almost in contact with the ││ │bottom of the tube. The colour of││ │the Silver DDC/Quinoline TS is not││ │changed. ││ │││ │Silver DDC/Quinoline TS: Dissolve 50││ │mg of finely powdered silver nitrate││ │in 100 mL of quinoline and add 0.2 g││ │of silver diethyldithiocarbamate.││ │The reagent should be freshly ││ │prepared.│└───────────┴──────────────────┘ Article 4
This Standard shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.
