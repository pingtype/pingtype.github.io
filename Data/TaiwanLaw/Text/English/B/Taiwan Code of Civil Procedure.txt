Article 391　 Where the defendant makes a preliminary showing that he/she will suffer irreparable harm from the provisional execution, the court shall, in the case provided in the Article 389, on the defendant's motion declare that no provisional execution shall be granted and, in the case provided in the preceding article, declare that the plaintiff's motion for provisional execution is denied.

Article 396　 Where the performance ordered by a judgment is of the nature that it cannot be effectuated within a short period of time, or after taking into consideration the defendant's condition and the plaintiff's interest, the court may reasonably extend the time period within which such performance shall be effectuated or permit performance by installment of the judgment entered.The same shall apply to the case where the plaintiff has given his/her consent.Where the court permits performance by installment in accordance with the provision of the preceding paragraph, all subsequent installments of performance shall become due upon defendant's default of performance of an installment.The time within which performance shall be effectuated starts to run from the time when the final judgment becomes binding or the final judgment to which provisional execution is declared is served upon the defendant.Where the court extends the time period of performance or permits performance by installment, the parties shall be accorded an opportunity to present their arguments before the decision is rendered.
Article 397　 Where the performance ordered by a final and binding judgment has not been effectuated, and a change of circumstance after the conclusion of the oral argument renders such performance manifestly unfair, one of the parties may reinitiate an action to claim that the performance or other effects ordered by the original judgment shall be amended insofar as no remedy provided by other legal proceedings is available.The provision of the preceding paragraph shall apply mutatis mutandis to settlement, mediation, or anything with the same effect as a final and binding judgment.

Article 401　 In addition to all parties, a final and binding judgment is binding on a person who becomes a party's successor after the initiation of the action and on a person who possesses the claimed object for the parties or their successors.A final and binding judgment to which a party has acted as the plaintiff or the defendant for another person is also binding on such other person.The provisions of the two preceding paragraphs shall apply mutatis mutandis to the declaration of provisional execution.

Where the foreign court lacks jurisdiction pursuant to the R.O.C. laws;2.
