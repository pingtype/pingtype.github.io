Whereas an inconsistency exists between the acts of the guardian ad litem and the acts of the person who has the capacity to represent himself or herself in proceedings, the acts in question shall be those that are determined to be appropriate by the court.The effects of the designation of a guardian ad litem are not limited to the particular court instance at which such a designation was made.The court, upon the motion by a guardian ad litem, may make a ruling on the amount of his or her remuneration, taking into account the duty he or she has performed, the complexity of the matters, as well as all other relevant factors. The amount of the remuneration shall constitute part of the proceedings fees.The court, when considers it necessary, may order the parties or the interested parties, within a designated period of time, to satisfy in advance the amount of remuneration provided in the preceding paragraph.

Under such a circumstance, the civil matter concerned shall be deemed to be under an initiation for civil matter mediation.With regard to the civil matter that is joined with the family matter for mediation, if it has already been registered with the court, the proceedings for that civil matter shall be suspended. Where the mediation concerned is brought to a successful conclusion, the proceedings for that civil matter shall be closed; where the mediation concerned is not brought to a successful conclusion, the proceedings for that civil matter shall resume.With regard to the civil matter that is joined with the family matter for mediation, if it has not yet been registered with the court, and where the mediation concerned is not brought to a successful conclusion, depending on the will of the parties, the proceedings for that civil matter shall be transferred to the appropriate civil procedure or other procedures to be continued; where the will of the parties is against such a transfer, the proceedings for that civil matter shall be closed.Article 27 　 Mediation proceedings for the family matter shall be conducted by a judge, who may request voluntary assistance from other agencies or organizations.Article 28 　 With regard to an initiation for mediation, where a judge, in the course of conducting the mediation proceedings and out of an assessment of the nature of the subject-matters of the case, comes to the belief that the continuation of the mediation will not yield tangible benefits, the judge shall question or direct the parties so as to acquire the agreement from the applicants, which shall be the basis for a ruling to direct the case to apply the adjudicative or other procedures; in circumstances under which the applicants are unwilling for the matter to apply other procedures, the judge shall deny the initiation by a ruling.A ruling made in accordance with the preceding paragraph is not reviewable.Where the court makes a ruling to direct the case to apply the adjudicative procedures based upon the agreement of the applicants in accordance with Paragraph 1 of this Article, the action shall be deemed to have been initiated upon the filing of the application for mediation.Article 29 　 In the course of family matter proceedings the court may, upon its own initiative, order the case to go through mediation.

With regard to matters involving divorce or termination of an adoptive relation, the mediated decision has to be explicitly agreed to by the parties to be effective.A mediated decision in accordance with the preceding paragraph has the same effect as a binding decision of the court upon its being reached.Where a mediated decision involves matters of personal identity or relationship that shall be effectuated by registration in accordance with the law, the court shall, upon its own initiative, notify the incumbent household registration office of such a circumstance.Where a mediation is brought to a successful conclusion, the parties may, within three months from the date on which the mediated decision is reached, move for the return of two-thirds of the court costs.Article 31 　 Where both parties have appeared on the date designated for the mediation session but the mediation did not yield a settlement, the court may, upon motion by one of the parties, order the case to be continued with the adjudicative procedure appropriate for the nature of the subject-matters; in such a circumstance the case shall be deemed to be brought to the court for adjudication from the date when the initiation for mediation was made. Nonetheless, the motion for postponement of the date for court session made by the other party shall be granted.Where a mediation brought by the parties by agreement did not yield a settlement, and when a applicant initiates the action within a peremptory period of ten day following the service of an unsuccessful mediation, such an action shall be deemed to be brought to the court for adjudication from the date when the initiation for mediation was made; the same applies to a request for application of the adjudicative procedure made prior to the service of an unsuccessful mediation.With regard to a situation where a party’s initiation of an action is deemed to be an initiation for mediation, where the mediation did not yield a settlement, except where the parties motion for postponement of the date for court session, the court shall order the case to be continued with the adjudicative procedure appropriate for the nature of the subject-matters. In such a circumstance, the case shall be deemed to be brought to the court for adjudication from the date when the original initiation of the action was made.Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article do not apply to a situation where there exists a ruling done in accordance with Article 33 or Article 36.Representations or concessions made by the parties in the mediation proceedings may not be admitted as the basis for making a decision over an action initiated as a result of an unsuccessful mediation.Where representations or concessions provided in the preceding paragraph have resulted in a written agreement on the subject matters of the proceeding, the facts of the case, the evidence or other matters that are subject to the parties’ own disposition, the parties shall be bound by the agreement so reached. The foregoing does not apply to circumstances under which the parties agree on amending the said agreement, there exist reasons not imputable to the parties, or there are other circumstances that render such an agreement manifestly unfair.Article 32 　 Rules that govern the qualification, selection and designation, performance assessment, training, discharge, remuneration or other related matters with regard to mediators handling family matters shall be prescribed by the Judicial Yuan.Mediation on family matters shall be handled by mediators who shall be selected from the appropriate persons who are equipped with awareness of gender equality and respect for multiculturalism.Except as otherwise provided in this Act, provisions in Part II, Chapter II of the Code of Civil Procedure on the mediation proceeding shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to mediation proceedings for the family matters.Article 33 　 With regard to matters that are not subject to the parties’ disposition, where the parties are very close to agreeing on their settlement or where the parties do not dispute the existence or inexistence of the transaction or occurrence that has given rise to the case, the parties may, by agreement, petition for a court ruling.Prior to making a ruling in accordance with the preceding paragraph, the court shall take into consideration the opinions of the mediators and the reports submitted by the family matter investigation officer.
