Amazing GraceAmazing graceoh how sweet the soundThat saved a wretch like me (like me)I once was lost, but now am foundWas blind, but now I seeTwas grace that taught my heart to fearAnd grace my fear relievedHow precious did that grace appearThe hour I first believed.Through many dangers, toils and snaresI have already comeTwas grace that lead mesafe thus farAnd grace will lead me homeThe Lord has promised good to meHis Word my hope securesHe will my shield and portion beAs long as life enduresWhen we've been there ten thousand yearsBright shining as the sunWe've no less days to sing God's praiseThan when, when we first begunThan when we'd first begun
