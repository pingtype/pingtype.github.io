With YouI will sing aboutEverything You are ,alwaysI will tell the worldEverything You've done in meI stand on higher groundI was lost but now I'm hereWith You, my refugeMy stronghold, alwaysWith You, faithful oneHolding onI am always with YouThe future of the worldIs within Your hands of loveLove reaches meI am in awe of You
