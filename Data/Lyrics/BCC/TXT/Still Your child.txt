Still Your ChildI have fallen down but You come and pick me upfrom the ground. You whisper words only I can hear: "I love you so. I love you so. I'm here."Shine Your Light. Bring me back to life.(chorus)I am still Your child,Good and gracious Father, I'm Your own.Nothing has changed. Your presence will remain. I'm still You're anointed.I'm Your own. This will never change. I'm Your own.This will never change. You are my Victory. In You I trample on my enemy. Lord, keep me where I belong -in the shelter of Your Mighty arm. Shine Your Light. Bring me back to life.Oh, I will sing of Your loveand of what You've done.Lord You are my song.
