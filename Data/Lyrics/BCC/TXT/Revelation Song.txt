Revelation SongWorthy is the Lamb who was slainHoly, holy is HeSing a new song to Him who sits onHeaven's mercy seatHoly, holy, holy is the Lord God AlmightyWho was and is and is to comeWith all creation I sing praise to the King of kingsYou are my everything and I will adore YouClothed in rainbows of living colorFlashes of lighting rolls of thunderBlessing and honor strength and glory and power beTo You the only wise KingFilled with wonder awestruck wonderAt the mention of Your nameJesus Your name is power, breath and living waterSuch a marvelous mysteryOh, You're worthy, mysteryYou are worthy
