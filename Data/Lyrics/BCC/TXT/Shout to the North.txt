Shout to the NorthMen of faith rise up and singOf the great and glorious KingYou are strong when you feel weakIn your brokenness completeChorus:Shout to the north and the southSing to the east and the westJesus is Savior to allHe's Lord of heaven and earthVerse 2: Rise up women of the truthStand and sing to broken heartsWho can know the healing powerOf our awesome King of loveBridge:  We've been through fire, we've been through painWe've been refined by the power of His nameWe've fallen deeper in love with YouYou've burned the truth on our lipsVerse 3:Rise up church with broken wingsFill this place with songs againOf our God who reigns on highBy his grace again we'll fly
