Trading My SorrowsI'm trading my sorrowsAnd I'm trading my shameAnd I'm laying it downFor the joy of the LordAnd I'm trading my sicknessAnd I'm trading my painI'm laying it downFor the joy of the LordI'm sayingYes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes LordYes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes LordYes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes LordAmenI'm pressed but not crushedPersecuted, not abandonedStruck down but not destroyedAnd I am blessed beyond the curseFor His promise will endureThat His joy is going to be my strengthThough my sorrows may last for the nightHis joy comes with the morning
