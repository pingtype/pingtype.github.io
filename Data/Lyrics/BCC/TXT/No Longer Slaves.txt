No Longer SlavesYou unravel me with a melodyYou surround me with a songOf deliverance from my enemies'Til all my fears are goneI'm no longer a slave to fearI am a child of GodFrom my mother's wombYou have chosen meLove has called my nameI've been born again into your familyYour blood flows through my veinsI am surroundedBy the arms of the fatherI am surroundedBy songs of deliveranceWe've been liberatedFrom our bondageWe're the sons and the daughtersLet us sing our freedomYou split the seaSo I could walk right through itMy fears were drowned in perfect loveYou rescued meAnd I will stand and singI am a child of God.Yes, I amI am a child of GodI am a child of GodYes, I amI am a child of GodFull of faithYes, I am a child of GodI am a child of GodI'm no longer a slave to fearI am a child of God
