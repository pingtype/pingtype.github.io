Wonderful, merciful SaviorPrecious Redeemer and FriendWho would have thought that a LambCould rescue the souls of menOh, You rescue the souls of menCounselor, Comforter, KeeperSpirit we long to embraceYou offer hope when our hearts haveHopelessly lost our wayOh, we've hopelessly lost the wayYou are the One that we praiseYou are the One we adoreYou give the healing and graceOur hearts always hunger forOh, our hearts always hunger forAlmighty, infinite FatherFaithfully loving Your ownHere in our weakness You find usFalling before Your throneOh, we're falling before Your throneYOU ARE
