Open My EyesI was lost. I was blindNow I see How You see meSometimes I forget Just who I am in YouI am perfect And beautiful Open my eyesMore and more each dayOpen my eyesFix my gaze on the unseen. I have been born Into an inheritance Deep inside me I'm one with the King Your breath in my lungs. Your thoughts in my mindYour words on my tongue. We're intertwined. Behold, beholdThe glory, the beauty, the majesty of our Lord. (x4)
