Come thou fount come thou kingCome, Thou Fount of every blessing, tune my heart to sing Thy graceStreams of mercy, never ceasing call for songs of loudest praiseTeach me some melodious sonnet sung by flaming tongues abovePraise the mount, I'm fixed up- on itMount of Thy re- deeming loveI was lost in utter darkness 'til You came and rescued meI was bound by all my sin when Your love came and set me freeNow my soul can sing a new song, now my heart has found a homeNow Your grace is always with meAnd I'll never be a- loneCome, Thou Fount, come, Thou King; Come, Thou precious Prince of PeaceHear Your bride, to You we sing, come,  Thou Fount of our bless- ingO, to grace, how great a debtor daily I'm constrained to beLet Thy goodness, like a fetter, bind my wandering heart to TheeProne to wander, Lord, I feel it, prone to leave the God I loveHere's my heart, Lord, take and seal itSeal it for Thy courts a- bove
