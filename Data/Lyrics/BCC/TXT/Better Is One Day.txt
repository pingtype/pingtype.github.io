How lovely isYour dwelling placeOh Lord Almighty,My soul doth longAnd even faintFor YouFor here my heartIs satisfiedWithin Your presenceI see beneathThe shadow ofYour wingsBetter is one day in Your courtsBetter is one day in Your houseBetter is one day in Your courtsThan thousands elsewhereOne thing I ask, and I would seekTo see Your beautyTo find You in the placeYour glory dwellsYour glory dwells(My heart and flesh cry out)My heart and flesh cry outFor You, the Living GodYour Spirit's water to my soulI've tasted, and I've seenCome once again to meI will draw near to YouI will draw near to YouTo You
