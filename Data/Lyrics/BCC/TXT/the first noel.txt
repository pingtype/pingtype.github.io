The First NoelThe First Noel the angel did sayWas to certain poor shepherdsin fields as they lay;In fields as they lay, keeping their sheep,On a cold winter's night that was so deep.Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,Born is the King of Israel.And by the light of that same starThree wise men came from country far;To seek for a king was their intent,And to follow the star wherever it went.This star drew nigh to the northwest,O'er Bethlehem it took it rest,And there it did both stop and stayRight over the place where Jesus lay.
