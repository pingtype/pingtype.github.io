Amazing Grace Amazing grace, How sweet the soundThat saved a wretch like me.I once was lost, but now I am found, Was blind, but now I see.'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, And grace my fears relieved.How precious did that grace appearThe hour I first believed.Through many dangers, toils and snaresI have already come, 'Tis grace has brought me safe thus farAnd grace will lead me home.The Lord has promised good to meHis word my hope secures; He will my shield and portion be, As long as life endures.Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail, And mortal life shall ceaseI shall possess within the veil, A life of joy and peace.When we've been there ten thousand yearsBright shining as the sun, We've no less days to sing God's praiseThan when we've first begun.
