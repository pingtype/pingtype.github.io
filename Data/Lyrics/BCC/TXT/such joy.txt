There’s a peace that floods my soulWhen the Spirit of the Lord is in controlAnd there’s a joy, no bounds can holdWhen the Spirit blows a fresh windthrough my soulHoly Spirit flow through meTouch my heart and there will, there will beSuch joy such unspeakable joySuch peace and everlasting peaceSuch love pure and holy loveSpirit have Your way in me
