And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” 30 And they spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the head. 31 And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him and led him away to crucify him.27 總督的士兵把耶穌帶到總督府，召集全隊士兵到他面前。 28 他們脫去他的衣服，給他披上朱紅色的外袍， 29 又用荊棘編成冠冕，戴在他的頭上，把一根蘆葦放在他的右手，跪在他面前譏笑他說：“猶太人的王萬歲！” 30 然後向他吐唾沫，又拿起蘆葦打他的頭。 31 戲弄完了，就脫下他的外袍，給他穿回自己的衣服，帶去釘十字架。
