Good Good FatherI've heard a thousand stories of what they think you're likeBut I've heard the tender whispers of lovein the dead of nightAnd you tell me that you're pleasedAnd that I'm never aloneYou're a good good fatherIt's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you areAnd I'm loved by youIt's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I amI've seen many searching for answers far and wideBut I know we're all searchingFor answers only you provide'Cause you know just what we needBefore we say a wordBecause you are perfect in all of your waysYou are perfect in all of your waysYou are perfect in all of your ways to usOh, it's love so undeniableI, I can hardly speakPeace so unexplainableI, I can hardly thinkAs you call me deeper stillAs you call me deeper stillAs you call me deeper stillInto love, love, love
