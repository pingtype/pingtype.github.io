Jesus Loves MeJesus loves me! This I know,For the Bible tells me so;Little ones to Him belong;They are weak, but He is strong.Yes, Jesus loves me!Yes, Jesus loves me!Yes, Jesus loves me!The Bible tells me so.Jesus loves me! This I know,As He loved so long ago,Taking children on His knee,Saying, “Let them come to Me.”Jesus loves me still today,Walking with me on my way,Wanting as a friend to giveLight and love to all who live.Jesus loves me! He who diedHeaven’s gate to open wide;He will wash away my sin,Let His little child come in.Jesus loves me! He will stayClose beside me all the way;Thou hast bled and died for me,I will henceforth live for Thee.
