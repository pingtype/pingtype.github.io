Standing here in Your presenceIn a grace so relentlessI am wonBy perfect loveWrapped within the arms of heavenIn a peace that lasts foreverSinking deepIn mercy's seaI'm wide awakeDrawing closeStirred by graceAnd all my heart is YoursAll fear removedI breathe You inI lean into Your loveOh, Your loveWhen I'm lost You pursue meLift my head to see Your gloryLord of allSo beautifulHere in You I find shelterCaptivated by the splendorOf Your faceMy secret placeYour love so deepIs washing over meYour face is all I seekYou are my everythingJesus ChristYou are my one desireLord hear my only cryTo know You all my life
