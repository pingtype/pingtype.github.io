You're the God of this City  You're the King of these people  You're the Lord of this nation You areYou're the Light in this darkness  You're the Hope to the hopeless  You're the Peace to the restless  You are There is no one like our God  There is no one like our God  For greater things have yet to comeGreater things are stillTo be done in this city
