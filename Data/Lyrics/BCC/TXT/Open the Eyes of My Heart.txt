Open the eyes of my heart, LordOpen the eyes of my heartI want to see YouI want to see YouTo see You high and lifted upShinin' in the light of Your gloryPour out Your power and loveAs we sing holy, holy, holyHoly, holy, holyWe cry holy, holy, holyYou are holy, holy, holyI want to see youHoly, holy, holyHoly, holy, holyYou are holy, holy, holyI want to see you
