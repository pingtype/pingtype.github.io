HosannaI see the king of gloryComing on the clouds with fireThe whole earth shakesThe whole earth shakesI see his love and mercyWashing over all our sinThe people singThe people singHosannaHosannaHosanna in the highestâ€¨I see a generationRising up to take their placeWith selfless faithWith selfless faithI see a near revivalStirring as we pray and seekWe're on our kneesWe're on our kneesHeal my heart and make it cleanOpen up my eyes to the things unseenShow me how to love like you have loved meBreak my heart for what breaks yoursEverything I am for Your kingdom's causeAs I walk from earth into eternity
