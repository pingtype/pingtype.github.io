EnoughAll of You is more than enough for all of me For every thirst and every need You satisfy me with Your love And all I have in You is more than enoughYou are my supply My breath of life And still more awesome than I know You are my reward worth living for And still more awesome than I knowAll of You is more than enough for all of me For every thirst and every need You satisfy me with Your love And all I have in You is more than enough You're my sacrifice Of greatest price And still more awesome than I know You're the coming King You are everything And still more awesome than I knowMore than all I want More than all I need You are more than enough for me More than all I know More than all I can say You are more than enough for me
