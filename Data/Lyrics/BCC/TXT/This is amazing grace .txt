This Is Amazing GraceWho breaks the power of sin and darkness?Whose love is mighty and so much stronger?The King of Glory, the King above all kingsWho shakes the whole earth with holy thunderAnd leaves us breathless in awe and wonder?The King of Glory, the King above all kingsThis is amazing graceThis is unfailing loveThat You would take my placeThat You would bear my crossYou laid down Your lifeThat I would be set freeOh, Jesus, I sing forAll that You've done for meWho brings our chaos back into order?Who makes the orphan a son and daughter?The King of Glory, the King of GloryWho rules the nations with truth and justice,Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance?The King of Glory, the King above all kingsWorthy is the Lamb who was slainWorthy is the King who conquered the graveWorthy is the Lamb who was slainWorthy is the King who conquered the gravethat You've done for me
