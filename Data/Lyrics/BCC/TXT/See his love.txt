See His LoveSee His love nailed onto a crossPerfect and blameless life, given as sacrificeSee Him there, all in the name of loveBroken yet glorious, all for the sake of usThis is Jesus in His gloryKing of heaven, dying for meIt is finished, He has done itDeath is beatenHeaven beckons meGreater love no one could ever showMercy so undeserved, freedom I should not knowAll my sin, all of my hidden shameDied with Him on the cross, eternity won for usSuch a loveSuch a loveSuch a love is this for me
