I surrender allAll to Jesus I surrender,All to Him I freely give;I will ever love and trust Him,In His presence daily liveI surrender all,I surrender all;All to Thee, my blessed Savior,I surrender all.All to Jesus I surrender,Humbly at His feet I bow;Worldly pleasures all forsaken,Take me, Jesus, take me now.All to Jesus I surrender,Make me, Savior, wholly Thine;Let me feel the Holy Spirit,Truly know that Thou art mine.All to Jesus I surrender,Lord, I give myself to Thee;Fill me with Thy love and power,Let Thy blessing fall on me.All to Jesus I surrender,Now I feel the sacred flame;Oh, the joy of full salvation!Glory, glory, to His Name!
