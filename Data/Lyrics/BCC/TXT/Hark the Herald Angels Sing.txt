Hark the herald angels singGlory to the newborn KingPeace on earth and mercy mildGod and sinners reconciledJoyful, all ye nations riseJoin the triumph of the skiesWith angelic host proclaimChrist is born in BethlehemHark the herald angels singGlory to the newborn KingHail the heav'n born Prince of PeaceHail the Son of RighteousnessLight and life to all He bringsRisen with healing in His wingsMild He lays His glory byBorn that man no more may dieBorn to raise the sons of earthBorn to give them second birth
