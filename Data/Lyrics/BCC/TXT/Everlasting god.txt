Everlasting God Strength will rise as we wait upon the LordWait upon the Lord,we will wait upon the LordOur God, You reign foreverOur hope, our strong delivererYou are the everlasting GodThe everlasting GodYou do not faint, you won't grow wearyYou're the defender of the weakYou comfort those in needYou lift us up on wings like eagles
