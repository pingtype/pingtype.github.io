The StandYou stood before creationEternity within Your handsYou spoke all life into motionMy soul now to standYou stood before my failureAnd carried the cross for my shameMy sin weighed upon Your shouldersMy soul now to standSo what can I sayAnd what could I doBut offer this heart O GodCompletely to YouSo I'll walk upon salvationYour Spirit alive in meThis life to declare Your promiseMy soul now to standSo I'll standWith arms high and heart abandonedIn awe of the One who gave it allI'll standMy soul Lord to You surrenderedAll I am is Yours
