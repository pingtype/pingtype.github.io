Be still for the presence of the lordBe still for the presence of the LordThe holy one is hereCome bow before him nowWith reverence and fearIn him no sin is foundWe stand on holy groundBe still for the presence of the LordThe holy one is he Be still for the glory of the LordIs shining all aroundHe burns with holy fireWith splendour he is crownedHow awesome is the sightOur radiant king of lightBe still for the glory of the LordIs shining all aroundBe still for the power of the LordIs moving in this placeHe comes to cleanse and healTo minister his graceNo work to hard for himIn faith receive from himBe still for the power of the LordIs moving in this place
