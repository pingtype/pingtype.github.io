With all I amInto your handsI commit again With all I am, for you, lordYou hold my worldIn the palm of your handAnd I am yours foreverJesus I believe in youJesus I belong to youYou're the reason that I liveThe reason that I singWith all I amI'll walk with youWherever you goThrough tears and joyI'll trust in youAnd I will liveIn all of your waysAnd your promises, foreverI will worship I will worship you
