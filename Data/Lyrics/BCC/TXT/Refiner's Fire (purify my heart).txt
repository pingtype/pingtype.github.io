Refiner's FirePurify my heart, Let me be as gold and precious silver.Purify my heart, Let me be as gold, pure gold.Refiner's fire, My heart's one desireIs to be... holy; Set apart for You, Lord.I choose to be... holy; Set apart for You, my Master, Ready to do Your will.Purify my heart, Cleanse me from withinAnd make me holy.Purify my heart, Cleanse me from my sin, deep within.
