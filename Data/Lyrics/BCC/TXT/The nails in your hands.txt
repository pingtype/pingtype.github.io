The nails in Your hands,The nails in Your feet,They tell me how much You love me.The thorns on Your brow,They tell me how,You bore so much shame to love me.  **  And when the heavens pass away,    All Your scars will still remain,    And forever they will say,    Just how much You love me.  So I want to say. . .Forever my love,Forever my heart, forever my life is Yours.Forever my love, forever my heart, forever my life is Yours.  Forever my love.
