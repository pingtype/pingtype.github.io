My Savior My GodI am not skilled to understandWhat God has willed what God Has plannedI only know at his right handStands one who is my SaviorI take him at his word and deedChrist died to save me this I readAnd in my heart I find the needOf him to be my SaviorThat he would leave his place on highAnd come for sinful man to dieYou called it strange so once did IBefore I knew my SaviorMy Savior lovesMy Savior livesMy Savior's always there for meMy God he wasMy God he isMy God he's always gonna beYes living, dying let me bringMy strength my Solace from the SpringThat he who lives to be my kingOnce died to be my Savior
