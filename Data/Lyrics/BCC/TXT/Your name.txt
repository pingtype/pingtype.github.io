Your NameAs morning dawns and evening fadesYou inspire songs of praiseThat rise from earth to touch Your heart and glorify Your NameYour Name is a strong and mighty towerYour Name is a shelter like no otherYour Name, let the nations sing it louder'Cause nothing has the power to saveBut Your NameJesus, in Your Name we prayCome and fill our hearts todayLord, give us strength to live for You and glorify Your Name
