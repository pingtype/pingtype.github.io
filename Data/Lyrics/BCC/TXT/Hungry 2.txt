594. HUNGRY (Falling on My Knees)Hungry, I come to You for I know You satisfyI am empty, but I know Your love does not run dry      And so I wait for You     So I wait for You  ** I’m falling on my knees  Offering all of me       Jesus, You’re all this   heart is living for. Broken, I run to You for Your arms are open wideI am weary, but I know Your touch restores my life.And so I wait for You     So I wait for You  *
