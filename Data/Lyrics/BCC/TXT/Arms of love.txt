I sing a simple song of loveTo my Savior, to my Jesus.I'm grateful for the things You've done,My loving Savior, my precious Jesus.My heart is glad thatYou've called me Your own.There's no place I'd rather be thanIn Your arms of love,In Your arms of love.Holding me still, holding me near,In Your arms of love.
