Once AgainJesus Christ, I think upon your sacrificeYou became nothing, poured out to deathMany times I've wondered at your gift of lifeAnd I'm in that place once againI'm in that place once againAnd once again I look upon the cross where you diedI'm humbled by your mercy and I'm broken insideOnce again I thank youOnce again I pour out my lifePour out our life's to youNow you are exalted to the highest placeKing of the heavens, where one day I'll bowBut for now I marvel at your saving graceAnd I'm full of praise once againFull of praise todayI'm full of praise once againAnd once again I look upon the cross where you diedI'm humbled by your mercy and I'm broken insideOnce again I thank youOnce again I pour out my lifeOh I pour out mine heart at your crossAnd once again I look upon the cross where you diedJesus I'm humbled by your mercy and I'm broken insideOnce again I thank youOnce again I pour out my lifeWe bring our grateful heart to youThanking you LordYour sacrifice, we thank you LordThank you for the crossThank you for the crossThank you for the cross, my friendOh thank you for the crossThank you for the crossThank you for the cross, my friend
