O soul are you weary and troubledNo light in the darkness you seeThere’s light for a look at the SaviorAnd life more abundant and freeTurn your eyes upon JesusLook full in His wonderful faceAnd the things of earth willgrow strangely dimIn the light of His glory and graceThrough death into life everlastingHe passed and we follow Him thereO’er us sin no more hath dominionFor more than conqu’rors we areHis Word shall not fail youHe promisedBelieve Him and all will be wellThen go to a world that is dyingHis perfect salvation to tell
