ForeverThe moon and stars they weptThe morning sun was deadThe Saviour of the world was fallenHis body on the crossHis blood poured out for usThe weight of every curse upon HimOne final breath He gaveAs heaven looked awayThe son of God was laid in darknessA battle in the graveThe war on death was wagedThe power of hell forever brokenThe ground began to shakeThe stone was rolled awayHis perfect love could not be overcomeNow death where is your sting?Our resurrected KingHas rendered you defeatedForever He is glorifiedForever He is lifted highForever He is risenHe is alive, He is alive!We sing hallelujahWe sing hallelujahWe sing hallelujahThe Lamb has overcome
