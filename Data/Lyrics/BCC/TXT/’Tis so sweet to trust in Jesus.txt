’Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus’Tis so sweet to trust in JesusAnd to take Him at His WordJust to rest upon His promiseAnd to know, “Thus saith the LordJesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!How I’ve proved Him o’er and o’er;Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!Oh, for grace to trust Him moreO how sweet to trust in Jesus,Just to trust His cleansing blood;Just in simple faith to plunge me,’Neath the healing, cleansing flood.I’m so glad I learned to trust TheePrecious Jesus, Savior, FriendAnd I know that Thou art with meWilt be with me to the end.Yes, ’tis sweet to trust in JesusJust from sin and self to ceaseJust from Jesus simply takingLife and rest, and joy and peace.
