that the bright and morning starWould choose to light the way, for my ever wandering heartNot because of who I am, But because of what You’ve doneNot because of what I’ve done, But because of who You areI am a flower quickly fading, Here today and gone tomorrowA wave tossed in the ocean, A vapor in the windStill You hear me when I’m callingLord, You catch me when I’m fallingAnd You’ve told me who I am,I am yours.Who am I, that the eyes that see my sinWould look on me with love, and watch me rise againWho am I, that the voice that calmed the seaWould call out through the rain, and calm the storm in meNot because of who I am, But because of what You’ve doneNot because of what I’ve done, But because of who You areI am a flower quickly fading, Here today and gone tomorrowA wave tossed in the ocean, A vapor in the windStill You hear me when I’m callingLord, You catch me when I’m fallingAnd You’ve told me who I am,I am Yours.Whom shall I fear Whom shall I fear Whom shall I fear ...I am Yours ...Not because of who I am, But because of what You’ve doneNot because of what I’ve done, But because of who You areI am a flower quickly fading, Here today and gone tomorrowA wave tossed in the ocean, A vapor in the windStill You hear me when I’m callingLord, You catch me when I’m fallingAnd You’ve told me who I am,I am Yours.Jesus Christ, I think upon Your sacrificeYou became nothing, poured out to deathMany times I’ve wondered at Your gift of lifeAnd I’m in that place once againI’m in that place once againAnd once again I look upon the cross where You diedI’m humbled by Your mercy and I’m broken insideOnce again I thank YouOnce again I pour out my lifeNow You are exalted to the highest placeKing of the heavens, where one day I’ll bowBut for now, I marvel at Your saving graceAnd I’m full of praise once againI’m full of praise once againThank You for the crossThank You for the crossThank You for the cross, my FriendCommunionMy Jesus I love Thee, I know Thou art mineFor Thee all the follies of sin I resignMy gracious Redeemer, my Savior art ThouIf ever I loved Thee, my Jesus 'tis nowI love Thee because Thou hast first loved meAnd purchased my pardon on Calvary's treeI love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy browIf ever I loved Thee, my Jesus 'tis nowI'll love Thee in life, I will love Thee in deathAnd praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breathAnd say when the death-dew lies cold on Thy browIf ever I loved Thee, my Jesus 'tis nowIn mansions of glory and endless delightI'll ever adore Thee in heaven so brightI'll sing with the glittering crown on my browIf ever I loved Thee, my Jesus 'tis nowGo in peace to love and to serveLet your ears ring longWith what you have heardAnd may the bread on your tongueLeave a trail of crumbsTo lead the hungry backTo the place that you are fromAnd take to the worldThis love, hope and faithTake to the worldThis rare, relentless graceAnd like the three in oneKnow you must becomeWhat you want to save'Cause that's still the wayHe takes to the worldGo, and go far,take light deep in the darkBelieve what's trueHe uses all, even youLeader: Go in peace to love and serve the LordAll: In the name of Christ, Amen
