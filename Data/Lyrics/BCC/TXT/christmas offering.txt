Over the skies of Bethlehem appeared a starWhile angels sang to lowly shepherdsThree Wisemen seeking truth they traveled from afarHoping to find the child from heavenFalling on their knees they bow before the humble Prince of PeaceWe bring an offering of worship to our KingNo one on earth deserves the praises that we singJesus may You receive the honor that You're dueO Lord I bring an offering to YouThe sun cannot compare to the glory of Your loveThere is no shadow in Your presenceNo mortal man would dare to stand before Your throneBefore the Holy One of heavenIt's only by Your bloodIt's only through Your mercyLord, I comeI bring an offering of worship to my KingNo one on earth deserves the praises that I singJesus, may you receive the honor that You're dueO Lord, I bring an offering to You
