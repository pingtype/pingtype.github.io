Discerning and obeyingthe will of GodJohn 7:14                                                         14 About the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching.15 The Jews therefore marveled, saying, "How is it that this man has learning, when he has never studied?" 16 So Jesus answered them, "My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me. 17 If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority. 18 The one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory; but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood. 19 Has not Moses given you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?" 20 The crowd answered, "You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?" 21 Jesus answered them, "I did one work, and you all marvel at it. 22 Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath. 23 If on the Sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man's whole body well? 24 Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.”約翰7:14-24                                                                      14	節期當中，耶穌上聖殿去教導人。                           15	猶太人就希奇，說：“這個人沒有學過，怎會通曉  經書呢？”                                                                         16	耶穌說：“我的教訓不是我自己的，而是出於那差我來的。                                                                           17	人若願意遵行　神的旨意，就會知道這教訓是出於　神，還是我憑著自己的意思說的。18	那憑著自己的意思說的，是求自己的榮譽；但那尋求差他來者的榮耀的，才是真誠的人，在他裡面沒有不義。19	摩西不是曾經把律法傳給你們嗎？你們竟然沒有一個人遵行律法。你們為甚麼想要殺我呢？”20	群眾回答：“你是鬼附的，誰想要殺你呢？”21	耶穌說：“我行了一件事，你們都以為希奇。22	摩西曾經把割禮傳給你們（其實割禮不是從摩西開始的，而是從列祖開始的），因此，你們在安息日也給人行割禮。23	如果人在安息日行割禮，為的是要遵守摩西的律法，那麼我在安息日使一個人全身健康，你們就向我生氣嗎？24	不要按外貌判斷人，總要公公平平地判斷人。”Wise discernment1. 聰明的辨別14 About the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching. 15 The Jews therefore marveled, saying, "How is it that this man has learning, when he has never studied?" 14	節期當中，耶穌上聖殿去教導人。15	猶太人就希奇，說：“這個人沒有學過，怎會通曉經書呢？”16 So Jesus answered them, "My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me. 16	耶穌說：“我的教訓不是我自己的，而是出於那差我來的。17 If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority. 18 The one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory; but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood. 17	人若願意遵行　神的旨意，就會知道這教訓是出於　神，還是我憑著自己的意思說的。18	那憑著自己的意思說的，是求自己的榮譽；但那尋求差他來者的榮耀的，才是真誠的人，在他裡面沒有不義。How do we discerngood Bible teaching from bad? 我們如何辨別聖經教導的好壞？Indicators of BAD biblical teaching:壞的聖經教導的指標 A.
