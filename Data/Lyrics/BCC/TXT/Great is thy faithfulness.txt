“Great is Thy faithfulness,”O God my Father,There is no shadow of turning with Thee;Thou changest not,Thy compassions, they fail notAs Thou hast been Thou forever wilt be.“Great is Thy faithfulness!” “Great is Thy faithfulness!”  Morning by morning new mercies I see;All I have needed Thy hand hath provided    “Great is Thy faithfulness,”Lord, unto me!Summer and winter, and springtime and harvest,Sun, moon and starsin their courses above,Join with all nature in manifold witnessTo Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,Thine own dear presenceto cheer and to guide;Strength for today andbright hope for tomorrow,Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside!
