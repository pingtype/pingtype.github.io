Blessed Be Your NameBlessed Be Your NameIn the land that is plentifulWhere Your streams of abundance flowBlessed be Your nameBlessed Be Your nameWhen I'm found in the desert placeThough I walk through the wildernessBlessed Be Your nameEvery blessing You pour outI'll turn back to praiseWhen the darkness closes in, LordStill I will sayBlessed be the name of the LordBlessed be Your nameBlessed be the name of the LordBlessed be Your glorious nameBlessed be Your nameWhen the sun's shining down on meWhen the world's 'all as it should be'Blessed be Your nameBlessed be Your nameOn the road marked with sufferingThough there's pain in the offeringBlessed be Your nameYou give and take awayYou give and take awayMy heart will choose to sayLord, blessed be Your name
