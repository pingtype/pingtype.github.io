Heart of WorshipI'll bring You more than a songFor a song in itselfIs not what You have requiredYou search much deeper withinThrough the way things appearYou're looking into my heartI'm coming back to the heart of worshipAnd it's all about You,It's all about You, JesusI'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made itWhen it's all about You,It's all about You, JesusKing of endless worthNo one could expressHow much You deserveThough I'm weak and poorAll I have is YoursEvery single breath
