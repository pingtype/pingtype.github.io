Angels We Have Heard on Highangels we have heard on highSweetly singing o'er the plainsAnd the mountains in replyEchoing their joyous strainsGloria, in excelsis Deo!Gloria, in excelsis Deo!Shepherds, why this jubileeWhy your joyous strains prolongWhat the gladsome tidings beWhich inspire your heavenly songCome to Bethlehem and seeHim whose birth the angels singCome, adore on bended kneeChrist the Lord, the newborn KingSee withinm a manger laidJesus, Lord of Heaven and earthMary Joseph, lend your aidWith us sing our Saviour's birth
