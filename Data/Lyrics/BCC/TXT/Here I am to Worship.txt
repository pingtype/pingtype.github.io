Here I am to WorshipLight of the worldYou stepped down into darknessOpened my eyes, let me seeBeauty that made this heart adore YouHope of a life spent with YouHere I am to worshipHere I am to bow downHere I am to say that You're my GodYou're altogether lovelyAltogether worthyAltogether wonderful to meKing of all daysOh so highly exaltedGlorious in heaven aboveHumbly You came to the earth You createdAll for love's sake became poorWell, I'll never know how much it costTo see my sin upon that cross
