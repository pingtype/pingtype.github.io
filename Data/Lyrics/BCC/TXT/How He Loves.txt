How He LovesHe is jealous for meLoves like a hurricaneI am a treeBending beneathThe weight of his wind and mercyWhen all of a suddenI am unaware of theseAfflictions eclipsed by gloryAnd I realize how beautiful you areAnd how great your affections for meOh how he loves us soOh how he loves usHow he loves us soYea He loves usOh how We are his portionAnd he is our prizeDrawn to redemption by the grace in his eyesIf grace is an ocean we're all sinkingSo heaven meets earth like a sloppy wet kissAnd my heart burns violently inside of my chestI don't have time to maintain these regretsWhen I think about the wayHe loves usI thought about youThe day Stephen diedAnd you met me between my breakingI know that I still love you GodDespite the agonySee people they want to tell me your cruelBut if Stephen could singHe'd say its not trueCause your good祂是如此愛我 愛就像龍捲風 襲捲著我 降服在祂 奇妙的同在和憐憫就在那一瞬間 我在不知不覺中 你榮耀遮蓋我苦難 我明白你是如此的榮美 你的愛對我是何其偉大喔 祂何等愛我 Oh如此愛我 祂何等愛我 Oh 祂好愛我 Oh祂好愛我 oh祂好愛我我們屬於祂 祂也屬我們 被吸引進入祂救贖大光中 我們沉浸在祂恩典海洋當天堂降臨 有如神親吻這地 我心在我裡面強烈回應 我不要再陷入過去悔恨 當我想到你愛我
