One Thing RemainsHigher than the mountains that I faceStronger than the power of the graveConstant through the trial and the changeOne thing remainsThis one thing remainsYour love never fails, and never gives upIt never runs out on me Your love never fails, and never gives upIt never runs out on me Your love never fails, and never gives upIt never runs out on meYour loveBecause on and on and on and on it goesBefore it overwhelms and satisfies my soulAnd I never, ever, have to be afraidOne thing remainsThis one thing remainsIn death, and in lifeI'm confident and covered by the power of your great loveMy debt is paid, there's nothing that can separate My heart from Your great loveOn and onYour love goes on and onSinging your loveYour love goes on and onHis love goes on and onSing it
