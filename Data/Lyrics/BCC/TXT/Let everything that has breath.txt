Let Everything That Has BreathLet ev'rything that, ev'rything thatEv'rything that has breath praise the LordLet ev'rything that, ev'rything thatEv'rything that has breath praise the LordPraise You in the morning, praise You in the eveningPraise You when I'm young and when I'm oldPraise You when I'm laughing, praise You with I'm grievingPraise You ev'ry season of the soulIf we could see how much You're worthYour power, Your might, Your endless loveThen surely we would never cease to praisePraise You in the heavens, joining with the angelsPraising You forever and a dayPraise You on the earth now, joining with creationCalling all the nations to Your praise
