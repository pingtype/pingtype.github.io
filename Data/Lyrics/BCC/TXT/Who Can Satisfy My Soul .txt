Who Can Satisfy My Soul Who can satisfy my soul like You?Who on earth could comfort me And love me like You do?Who could ever be more faithful true?I will trust in You; I will trust in You, my GodThere is a Fountain, who is the KingVictorious Warrior, and Lord of everythingMy Rock, my Shelter,my very ownBlessed Redeemer,who reigns upon the throne.Living water, rain down Your life on meCleansing me, refreshing me with life abundantlyRiver, full of life,I'll go where You leadI will trust in You, I will trust in You, my God.Amen, Give God all Glory honour and praise for He is almighty and faithful.
