Amazing GraceAmazing grace, how sweet the soundThat saved a wretch like me.I once was lost, but now I'm found;Was blind, but now I see.T'was grace that taught my heart to fear,And grace my fear relieved;How precious did that grace appearThe hour I first believed.Through many dangers, toils and snares,I have already come.This grace that brought us safe thus far,And grace will lead us home.When we've been here ten thousand yearsBright shining as the sun.We've no less days to sing God's praiseThan when we've first begun.
