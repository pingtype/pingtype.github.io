Shout To The LordMy Jesus, my SaviorLord, there is none like YouAll of my days, I want to praiseThe wonders of Your mighty loveMy comfort, my shelterTower of refuge and strengthLet every breath, all that I amNever cease to worship YouShout to the Lord, all the earth, let us singPower and majesty, praise to the KingMountains bow down and the seas will roarAt the sound of Your nameI sing for joy at the work of Your handsForever I'll love You, forever I'll standNothing compares to the promise I have in YouI sing for joy at the work of Your handsForever I'll love You, forever I'll standNothing compares to the promise I have in YouNothing compares to the promise I have in YouNothing compares to the promise I have in You
