Christ is EnoughChrist is my rewardAnd all of my devotionNow there's nothing in this worldThat could ever satisfyThrough every trialMy soul will singNo turning backI've been set freeChrist is enough for meChrist is enough for meEverything I need is in YouEverything I needChrist my all in allThe joy of my salvationAnd this hope will never failHeaven is our homeThrough every stormMy soul will singJesus is hereTo God be the gloryI have decided to follow JesusNo turning backNo turning backThe cross before meThe world behind meNo turning backNo turning back
