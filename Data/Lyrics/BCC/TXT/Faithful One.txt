Faithful OneFaithful one, so unchangingAgeless one,you're my rock of peaceLord of all I depend on youI call out to you, again and againI call out to you, again and againYou are my rock in times of troubleYou lift me up when I fall downAll through the stormYour love is, the anchorMy hope is in You alone
