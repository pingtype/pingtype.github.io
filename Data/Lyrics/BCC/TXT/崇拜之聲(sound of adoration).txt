崇拜之聲 Sound of Adoration我曾走迷了路, 祢是那牧人領我回家我曾揮霍落魄, 祢卻張開雙臂迎回我我不能停止讚美When we were lost ones You were the Shepherd that carried us home When we were prodigals You ran to meet us with open arms And we can't hold back our praise 我曾遭受患難, 祢接納保守扶持我我曾與祢為敵, 祢卻為我付清罪債我不能停止讚美When we were refugees You were the One who took us in When we were enemies You paid the price for all our sin And we can't hold back our praise 我們要發出崇拜之聲, 喔何等愛祢耶穌我愛祢祢是受造萬物的喜樂, 喔何等愛祢耶穌我愛祢This is the sound of adoration Oh, how we love You Jesus, we love You You are the joy of all creation Oh, how we love You Jesus, we love You 祢是那復活主, 祢勝過死亡並開道路祢高唱自由, 如今我得釋放跳舞我不能停止讚美You are the Risen One You conquered death and made a way You sang our freedom song Now we are dancing on our chains And we can't hold back our praise 藉十架得自由, 祢恩典改變一切曾瞎眼今看見, 祢恩典改變一切改變一切By the cross, I am free Your grace changes everything I was blind, now I see Your grace changes everything Everything
