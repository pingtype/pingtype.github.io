For the praises of manI will never ever standFor the kingdoms of this worldI'll never give my heart awayOr shout my praiseMy allegiance and devotionMy heart's desireand all emotionGo to serve the ManWho died upon that treeOnly a God like YouCould be worthy of my praiseAnd all my hope and faithTo only a King of all kingsDo I bow my knee and singGive my everything (x2)To only my Maker,my Father, my SaviorRedeemer, Restorer,Rebuilder, RewarderTo only a God like YouDo I give my praiseOnly the God Who leftHis throne aboveHe came to live with usCome to be one of usTo only the oneWho stopped to heal that blind manTook the time to save thatone lost lambTo only the King Who wore thatcrown of thornsSo I could wear the crown of lifeAnd to only the OneWho conquered sin and deathSo we could be set freeSo we could stand here and singOnly a God like YouOnly a God like YouOnly a God like youTo only my Maker,my Father, my SaviorRedeemer, Restorer,Rebuilder, RewarderTo only a God like YouDo I give my praise
