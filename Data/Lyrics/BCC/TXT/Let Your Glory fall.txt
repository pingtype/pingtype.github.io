Let Your glory fall Father of creation, unfoldyour sovereign planRaise up a chosen generationThat will march through the landAll of creation is longingFor your unveiling of powerWould you release your anointingOh God let this be the hourLet your glory fall in this roomLet it go forth from here to the nationsLet your fragrance rest in this placeAs we gather to seek your faceRuler of the nations the world has yet to seeThe full release of your promiseThe church in victoryTurn to us Lord and touch usMake us strong in your mightOvercome our weaknessThat we could stand up and fight(Chorus)Let your kingdom comeLet your will be doneLet us see on earthThe glory of your son
