Draw Me CloseDraw me close to youNever let me goI lay it all down againTo hear you say that I'm your friendYou are my desireNo one else will do'Cause nothing else can take your placeTo feel the warmth of your embraceHelp me find the wayBring me back to youYou're all I wantYou're all I've ever neededYou're all I wantHelp me know you are near
