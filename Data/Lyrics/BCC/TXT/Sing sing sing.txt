Sing, sing, singWe will sing, sing, singAnd make music with the heavensWe will sing, sing, singGrateful that You hear usWhen we shout your praiseLift high the name of JesusWhat's not to love about You?Heaven and earth adore YouKings and kingdoms bow downSon of God, You are the OneYou are the One we're living forYou are the love that frees usYou are the light that leads usLike a fire burningSon of God, You are the oneYou are the one we're living for
