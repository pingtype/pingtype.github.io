Lewis: “In commanding us to glorify Him, God is inviting us to enjoy Him.”魯易斯：“命令我們榮耀祂，其實是神在邀請我們享受祂”。John Piper:Two things cry out to be stressed in our day. First, our salvation is for God's sake. To be sure, God will save his people, he will bless us infinitely! But it is for his name's sake, for his praise, for his glory that he does it… The second thing that needs to be stressed is this: God will not allow his name to be profaned indefinitely. Though he is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, he will not tolerate forever those who do not give him glory, but instead regard something else as more glorious, more worthy of allegiance.約翰 派博：在現今世代，有兩件事情需要得到極度重視。第一，我們的救恩是為了上帝的緣故。上帝會拯救祂的百姓，祂也會無限地祝福我們。但那是為了祂的名、他的讚美和他的榮耀而為。第二件需要強調的是：上帝不會允許祂的名無限期地被褻瀆。雖然祂不輕易發怒且有豐盛的慈愛，祂不會永遠地容忍那些不將榮耀歸於祂，卻認為其他的事物更配得榮耀、更值得忠誠之人。Double-click to editJohn 7:40-5240 When they heard these words, some of the people said, "This really is the Prophet." 41 Others said, "This is the Christ."
