We fall downWe lay our crownsAt the feet of JesusThe greatness ofMercy and loveAt the feet of JesusWe cry holy, holy, holyWe cry holy, holy, holyWe cry holy, holy, holyIs the lambNo more fears, You've dried our tearsat the feet of Jesus Grace abounds to all who've foundthe feet of Jesus
