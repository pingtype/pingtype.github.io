Broken Vessels (Amazing Grace)All these pieces  Broken and scatteredIn mercy gathered  Mended and wholeEmpty handed  But not forsakenI've been set freeâ€¨I've been set freeYou take our failure  You take our weaknessYou set Your treasure in Jars of claySo take this heart, LordI'll be Your vesselThe world to see Your life in meAmazing grace How sweet the soundThat saved a wretch like meI once was lost But now I'm foundWas blind but now I seeOh I can see You nowI can see the love in Your eyesLaying Yourself downRaising up the broken to life
