My Redeemer LivesI know He rescued my soulHis blood has covered my sinI believe, I believeMy shame He's taken awayMy pain is healed in His nameI believe, I believeI'll raise a bannerMy Lord Has conquered the graveMy redeemer livesMy redeemer livesMy redeemer livesMy redeemer livesYou lift my burdensI'll rise with YouI'm dancing on this mountain topTo see Your kingdom come
