Beautiful oneWonderful, so wonderfulIs your unfailing loveYour cross has spoken mercy over meNo eye has seen no ear has heardNo heart could fully knowHow gloriousHow beautiful you are.Beautiful one I loveBeautiful one I adoreBeautiful one my soul must sing.Powerful so powerfulYour glory fills the skiesYour mighty worksdisplayed for all to seeThe beauty of your majestyAwakes my heart to seeHow marvelousHow wonderful you are.You opened my eyes toyour wonders anewYou captured my heart with this loveBecause nothing on Earth isas beautiful as youMy soul, my soul must singâ€¨beautiful one
