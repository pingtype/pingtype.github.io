Why Did Jesus Die?(Isa 53:4-6) Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. 5But he was wounded for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his stripes we are healed. 6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned--every one--to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all. （賽53:4-6）原來他擔當了我們的病患，背負了我們的痛苦；我們卻以為他受責打，被　神擊打和苦待了。5 然而他是為了我們的過犯被刺透，為了我們的罪孽被壓傷；使我們得平安的懲罰加在他身上，因他受了鞭傷，我們才得醫治。6 我們眾人都如羊走迷了路，各人偏行己路；耶和華卻把我們眾人的罪孽，都歸在他身上。4 “Surely he has borne our griefsand carried our sorrows;yet we esteemed him stricken,smitten by God, and afflicted”4 原來他擔當了我們的病患，背負了我們的痛苦；我們卻以為他受責打，被　神擊打和苦待了。What a friend we have in Jesus,All our sins and griefs to bear.耶穌是我親愛朋友，擔當我罪與憂愁； 5 “But he was pierced for our transgressions;he was crushed for our iniquities;upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,and with his wounds we are healed” 5 然而他是為了我們的過犯被刺透，為了我們的罪孽被壓傷；使我們得平安的懲罰加在他身上，因他受了鞭傷，我們才得醫治。6 “All we like sheep have gone astray;we have turned—every one—to his own way;and the Lord has laid on himthe iniquity of us all.”6 我們眾人都如羊走迷了路，各人偏行己路；耶和華卻把我們眾人的罪孽，都歸在他身上。Hallelujah!

What a Savior!天父愛子由天至，常經憂患遭厭棄，拯救罪人脫永死，哈利路亞！奇妙救主！Bearing shame and scoffing rude,In my place condemned He stood;Sealed my pardon with His blood.Hallelujah! What a Savior!受盡羞辱與欺凌，為我贖罪受苦刑，藉主寶血得潔淨，哈利路亞！奇妙救主！Guilty, vile, and helpless we;Spotless Lamb of God was He;“Full atonement!” can it be?Hallelujah! What a Savior!我滿罪污無蔭庇，祂是聖羔無瑕疵，救贖大功真希奇！哈利路亞！奇妙救主！Lifted up was He to die;“It is finished!” was His cry;Now in Heav’n exalted high.Hallelujah! What a Savior!主釘十架捨生命，救世使命已完成，今居至高榮美城，哈利路亞！奇妙救主！
