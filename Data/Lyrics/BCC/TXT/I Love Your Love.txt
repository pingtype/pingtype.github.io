I Love Your LoveSometimes when I feel Your love as I walk along the busy streets I'll whisper Your name under my breath And sometimes I feel Your touch in the quiet place of my room I sing Your name in adorationThere are times when I feel like I'm bursting with your love so strong and so true and in my heart I feel such a yearning I want all the world to know to know You love them tooI love Your love gonna shout it out aloud I love Your love wanna tell the world about it I love Your love 'cause I found it to be true and I live to love You too
