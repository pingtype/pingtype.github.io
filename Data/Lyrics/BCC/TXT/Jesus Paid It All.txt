Jesus Paid It AllI hear the Savior say, Thy strength indeed is small;Child of weakness, watch and pray, Find in Me thine all in all.Jesus paid it all,All to Him I owe;Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.Lord, now indeed I find Thy power and Thine alone,Can change the leper's spots and melt the heart of stone.And when before the throne I stand in Him complete,Jesus died my soul to save,my lips shall still repeatJesus paid it all, All to Him I owe;Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snowSin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snowO Praise the one who paid my debtAnd raised this life up from the deadO Praise the one who paid my debtAnd raised this life up from the dead
