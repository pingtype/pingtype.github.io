Amazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone)Amazing graceHow sweet the soundThat saved a wretch like meI once was lost, but now I'm foundWas blind, but now I see'Twas grace that taught my heart to fearAnd grace my fears relievedHow precious did that grace appearThe hour I first believedMy chains are goneI've been set freeMy God, my Savior has ransomed meAnd like a flood His mercy reignsUnending love, amazing graceThe Lord has promised good to meHis word my hope securesHe will my shield and portion beAs long as life enduresThe earth shall soon dissolve like snowThe sun forbear to shineBut God, Who called me here below,Will be forever mine.Will be forever mine.You are forever mine.
