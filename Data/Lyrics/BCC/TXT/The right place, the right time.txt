John 7:1-131 After this Jesus went about in Galilee. He would not go about in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill him. 2 Now the Jews' Feast of Booths was at hand. 3 So his brothers said to him, "Leave here and go to Judea, that your disciples also may see the works you are doing. 4 For no one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world." 5 For not even his brothers believed in him. 6 Jesus said to them,"My time has not yet come, but your time is always here. 7 The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it that its works are evil. 8 You go up to the feast. I am not going up to this feast, for my time has not yet fully come." 9 After saying this, he remained in Galilee. 10 But after his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly but in private. 11 The Jews were looking for him at the feast, and saying, "Where is he?" 12 And there was much muttering about him among the people. While some said, "He is a good man," others said, "No, he is leading the people astray." 13 Yet for fear of the Jews no one spoke openly of him.約翰7:1-131 這事以後，耶穌周遊加利利，不願在猶太往來，因為猶太人想要殺他。2 猶太人的住棚節快到了，3 耶穌的弟弟就對他說：“你應當離開這裡上猶太去，好讓你的門徒也可以看見你所行的事；4 因為沒有人想引人注目，卻在暗處行事的。你既然行這些事，就應該向世人顯明自己。”5 原來連他的弟弟也不信他。6 耶穌就對他們說：“我的時候還沒有到，你們的時候卻常常是方便的。7 世人不能恨你們，卻憎恨我，因為我指證他們的行為是邪惡的。8 你們上去過節吧！我現在不上去，因為我的時機還沒有成熟。”9 他說了這些話以後，仍然住在加利利。10 然而，他的弟弟上去過節以後，他也上去過節，不是公開地去，卻是暗中地去。11 過節的時候，猶太人尋找耶穌，說：“那人在哪裡呢？”12 群眾因他紛紛議論，有的說：“他是好人。”有的說：“不，他是欺騙眾人的。”13 但沒有人敢公開講論他，因為怕猶太人。Ray Kroc: The two most important requirements for major success are: first, being in the right place at the right time, and second, doing something about it.                                              Ray Kroc：重大成功所需要的兩個                                              主要因素是：第一，在正確的時間                                              處於正確的地點。第二，在此前提                                              下做你所能做的事情。1 After this Jesus went about in Galilee.
