The greatest day in historyDeath is beaten, You have rescued meSing it out, Jesus is aliveThe empty cross, the empty graveLife eternal, You have won the dayShout it out, Jesus is aliveHe's aliveOh, happy day, happy dayYou washed my sin awayOh, happy day, happy dayI'll never be the sameForever I am changedWhen I stand in that placeFree at last, meeting face to faceI am yours, Jesus, You are mineEndless joy, perfect peaceEarthly pain finally will ceaseCelebrate, Jesus is aliveHe's aliveOh, what a glorious dayWhat a glorious wayThat You have saved meAnd oh, what a glorious dayWhat a glorious name
