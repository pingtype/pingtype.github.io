From the Inside OutA thousand times I've failedStill Your mercy remainsAnd should I stumble againI'm caught in Your graceEverlastingYour light will shine when all else fadesNever endingYour glory goes beyond all fameYour will above all elseMy purpose remainsThe art of losing myselfIn bringing You praiseEverlastingYour light will shine when all else fadesNever endingYour glory goes beyond all fameIn my heart and my soulLord I give You controlConsume me from the inside out,Lord, let justice and praiseBecome my embraceTo love you from the inside outEverlastingYour light will shine when all else fadesNever endingYour glory goes beyond all fameAnd the cry of my heartIs to bring You praiseFrom the inside outLord my soul cries out
