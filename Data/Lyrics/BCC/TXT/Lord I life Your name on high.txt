"Lord I Lift Your Name On High"Lord I lift Your name on highLord I love to sing Your praisesI'm so glad You're in my lifeI'm so glad You came to save usYou came from heaven to earthTo show the wayFrom the earth to the crossMy debt to payFrom the cross to the graveFrom the grave to the skyLord I lift Your name on high
