O Lord, my God, when I in awesome wonderConsider all the worldsThy Hands have made;I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,Thy power throughoutthe universe displayedThen sings my soul,My Saviour God, to Thee,How great Thou art (*2)Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,How great Thou art (*2)And when I think of God,His Son not sparing;Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing,He bled and died to take away my sin.When Christ shall comewith shout of acclamationAnd lead me home, what joy shall fill my heart!Then I shall bow with humble adoration,And then proclaim,"My God, how great Thou art!"
