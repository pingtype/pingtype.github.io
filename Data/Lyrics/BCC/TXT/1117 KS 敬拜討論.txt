There’s more that rises in the morning than the sunAnd more that shines in the night than just the moonIt’s more than this fire here that keeps me warmIn a shelter that is larger than this roomAnd there’s a loyalty that’s deeper than mere sentimentsAnd a music higher than the songs that I can singThe stuff of earth competes with allegianceI owe only to the Giver of all good thingsSo if I stand let me stand on the promiseThat you will pull me throughAnd if I can't let me fall on the graceThat first brought me to YouAnd if I sing let me sing for the joyThat has born in me these songsAnd if I weep let it be as a manWho is longing for his homeThere’s more that dances on the prairies than the windAnd more that pulses in the ocean than the tideThere’s a love that’s fiercer than the love between friendsMore gentle than a mother’s when her baby’s at her side
