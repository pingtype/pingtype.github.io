It is my meditation all the day. 98 Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies, for it is ever with me. 99 I have more understanding than all my teachers, for your testimonies are my meditation.”（詩篇119:97-99）我多麼愛慕你的律法，終日不住地默想。98 你的命令使我比我的仇敵更有智慧，因為你的命令常存在我裡面。99 我比我所有的老師明智，因為我默想你的法度。How well do you know the Bible? 你對聖經了解多少？Why read the Bible? 為什麼要讀聖經？1. The word of God 上帝的話(1 Thessalonians 2:13) “And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers.” （帖前2:13）我們也為這緣故不住感謝　神，因為你們接受了我們所傳的　神的道，不認為這是人的道，而認為這確實是　神的道。這道也運行在你們信的人裡面。Isaac Newton: I have a fundamental belief in the Bible as the Word of God, written by those who were inspired. I study the Bible daily.2.

Identity 身分(John 1:12) “But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.”（約翰1:12）凡接受他的，就是信他名的人，他就賜給他們權利，成為神的兒女。8. Holiness 聖潔(Psalm 119:9,11) “How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to your word. 11 I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you.”（詩篇119:9，11）少年人用甚麼潔淨自己的行為呢？就是要遵守你的話。11 我把你的話藏在心裡，免得我得罪你。9. Success 成功(Joshua 1:8) “Study this Book of Instruction continually. Meditate on it day and night so you will be sure to obey everything written in it. Only then will you prosper and succeed in all you do.”（書1:8）這律法書不可離開你的口，要晝夜默誦，好使你謹守遵行書中所記的一切；這樣，你的道路就必順利，你必一路亨通。美國國父華盛頓：「欲謀國家之長治，世界之久安，捨上帝與聖經外，將無由實現。」10.
