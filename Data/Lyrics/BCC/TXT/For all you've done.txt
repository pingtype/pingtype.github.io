My Saviour, RedeemerLifted me from the miry clayAlmighty foreverI will never be the same'Cause You came near from the everlastingTo the world we liveThe Father's only SonAnd You lived, You diedYou rose again on highYou opened the wayFor the world to live againHallelujah for all You've done
