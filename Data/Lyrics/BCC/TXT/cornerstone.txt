CornerstoneMy hope is built on nothing lessThan Jesus blood and righteousnessI dare not trust the sweetest frameBut wholly trust in Jesus nameChrist alone; cornerstoneWeak made strong; in the Saviour's loveThrough the storm, He is LordLord of allWhen Darkness seems to hide His faceI rest on His unchanging graceIn every high and stormy galeMy anchor holds within the veilMy anchor holds within the veilChrist alone; cornerstoneWeak made strong; in the Saviour's loveThrough the storm, He is LordLord of allHe is LordLord of allWhen He shall come with trumpet sound,Oh, may I then in Him be found;Dressed in His righteousness alone,Faultless stand before the throne.
