Our GodWater you turned into wine, opened the eyes of the blind there's no one like you, none like You!Into the darkness you shine out of the ashes we rise there's no one like you none like You!Our God is greater, our God is stronger, God you are higher than any other.Our God is Healer, Awesome in Power, Our God! Our God!Into the darkness you shine, out of the ashes we rise there's no one like you, none like You!And if our God is for us, then who could ever stop us?And if our God is with us, then what could stand against?
