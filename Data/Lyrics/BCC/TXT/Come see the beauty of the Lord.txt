Come see the beauty of the LordCome see the beauty of the Lord. 請看耶穌救主榮美，Come see the beauty of His face. 看主耶穌聖容榮美，See the Lamb that once was slain. 來看他，擔罪羔羊，See on His palms is carved your name. 看主手心，刻你名字，See how our sin has pierced His heart. 看你痛傷刺痛主心，And on His brow He bears our pride 看你驕矜將主壓傷，A crown of thorns.荊棘冠冕。But only love pours from His heart. 從主的心傾下慈愛，As silently He takes the blame. 默默無聲，他受刑罰，He has my name upon His lips. 主柔聲喚我名字，My condemnation falls on Him. 為我擔當一切罪過。This love is marvelous to me. 主愛奇恩奧妙難測，His sacrifice has set me free. 救主捨生，賜我永生，And now I live.我得釋放。
