Bless the Lord, Oh my soulOh my soul, worship his holy nameSing like never before, Oh my soulI'll worship your holy nameThe sun comes up, it's a new day dawningIt's time to sing your song againWhatever may pass and whatever lies before meLet me be singing when the evening comesYou're rich in love and you're slow to angerYour name is great and your heart is kindFor all your goodness, I will keep on singingTen thousand reasons for my heart to findAnd on that day when my strength is failingThe end draws near and my time has comeStill my soul will sing your praise unendingTen thousand years and then forevermore
