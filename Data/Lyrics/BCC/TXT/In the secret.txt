In the secret,In the quiet placeIn the stillness you are there.In the secret, in the quiet hour I wait, only for youBecause I want to know you more.I want to know you I want to hear your voiceI want to know you moreI want to touch you I want to see your faceI want to know you moreI am reaching for the highest goalThat I might recieve the prize.Pressing onward, Pushing every hindrance aside,Out of my wayCause I want to know you more
