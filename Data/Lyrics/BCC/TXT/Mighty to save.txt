Mighty to SaveEveryone needs compassionA love that's never failingLet mercy fall on meEveryone needs forgivenessA kindness of a SaviorThe hope of nationsSaviorHe can move the mountainsMy God is Mighty to saveHe is Mighty to saveForeverAuthor of salvationHe rose and conquered the graveJesus conquered the graveSo take me as You find meAll my fears and failuresFill my life againI give my life to followEverything I believe inNow I surrenderShine your light and let the whole world seeWe're singing for the glory of the risen KingJesus
