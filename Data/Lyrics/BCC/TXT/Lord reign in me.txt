Over all the earthYou reign on highEvery mountain streamEvery sunset skyBut my one requestLord, my only aimIs that you reign in me againLord, reign in meReign in your powerOver all my dreamsIn my darkest hourYou are the Lord of all I amSo won't you reign in me again?Over every thoughtOver every wordMay my life reflectThe beauty of my Lord'Cause you mean more to meThan any earthly thingSo won't you reign in me again?Won't you reign?Won't you reign in me again?Come and praise the LordWon't you reign in me again?
