Did you feel the mountains trembleDid you feel the mountains tremble?Did you hear the oceans roar?When the people rose to sing ofJesus Christ the risen oneDid you feel the people tremble?Did you hear the singers roar?When the lost began to sing ofJesus Christ the saving oneAnd we can see that God you're movingA mighty river through the nationsWhen young and old return to JesusFling wide your heavenly gatesPrepare the way of the risen LordOpen up the doors and let the music playLet the streets resound with singingSongs that bring your hopeSongs that bring your joyDancers who dance upon injusticeDid you feel the darkness trembleWhen all the saints join in one songAnd all the streams flow as one riverTo wash away our brokeness
