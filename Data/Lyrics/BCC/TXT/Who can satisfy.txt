Who can satisfyWho can satisfy my soul like YouWho on earth could love meAnd comfort like You doWho could ever be more faithful trueWho can satisfyWho can satisfy like YouThere is a fountain who is a KingVictorious warriorAnd Lord of everythingMy rock my shelter my very ownBlessed Redeemer who reignsUpon the throne
