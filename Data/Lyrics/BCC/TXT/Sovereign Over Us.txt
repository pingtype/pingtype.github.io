Sovereign Over UsThere is strength within the sorrowThere is beauty in our tearsAnd You meet us in our mourningWith a love that casts out fearYou are working in our waitingYou're sanctifying usWhen beyond our understandingYou're teaching us to trustYour plans are still to prosperYou have not forgotten usYou're with us in the fire and the floodYou're faithful foreverPerfect in loveYou are sovereign over usYou are wisdom unimaginedWho could understand Your waysReigning high above the HeavensReaching down in endless graceYou're the lifter of the lowlyCompassionate and kindYou surround and You uphold meAnd Your promises are my delightEven what the enemy means for evilYou turn it for our goodYou turn it for our good and for Your gloryEven in the valley, You are faithfulYou're working for our goodYou're working for our good and for Your gloryYou're faithful foreverPerfect in loveYou are sovereign over us
