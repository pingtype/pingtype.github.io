Hail to the King  You came to us a man, in very nature God Pierced for our iniquities, As You hung upon the cross, But God exalted You to the highest place And gave to You the right to bear, The name above all names That at the name of Jesus we should bow And every tongue confess that You are Lord And when You come in glory For the world to see, we will sing ChorusHail to the King  In all His splendor and majesty Hail to the King of Kings, Lord Jesus, our God We eagerly await the coming of the day When the glory of the risen King Will shine upon the earth   Then rival thrones will fall Before the Lord of all And hail supreme authority In the true of living God At the name of Jesus we will bow As every tongue confesses You as Lord  When You come in gloryFor the world to see, we will sing.
