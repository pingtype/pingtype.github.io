1 Oh come, let us sing to the Lord ! Let us shout joyfully to the Rock of our salvation.2 Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving; Let us shout joyfully to Him with psalms.3 For the Lord is the great God, And the great King above all gods.4 In His hand are the deep places of the earth; The heights of the hills are His also.5 The sea is His, for He made it; And His hands formed the dry land.6 Oh come, let us worship and bow down; Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.7 For He is our God, And we are the people of His pasture, And the sheep of His hand. Today, if you will hear His voice:8 "Do not harden your hearts, as in the rebellion, As in the day of trial in the wilderness,9 When your fathers tested Me; They tried Me, though they saw My work.10 For forty years I was grieved with that generation, And said, 'It is a people who go astray in their hearts, And they do not know My ways.'11 So I swore in My wrath, 'They shall not enter My rest.' "
