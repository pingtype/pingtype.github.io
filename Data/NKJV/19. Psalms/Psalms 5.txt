1 Give ear to my words, O Lord , Consider my meditation.2 Give heed to the voice of my cry, My King and my God, For to You I will pray.3 My voice You shall hear in the morning, O Lord ; In the morning I will direct it to You, And I will look up.4 For You are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness, Nor shall evil dwell with You.5 The boastful shall not stand in Your sight; You hate all workers of iniquity.6 You shall destroy those who speak falsehood; The Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.7 But as for me, I will come into Your house in the multitude of Your mercy; In fear of You I will worship toward Your holy temple.8 Lead me, O Lord , in Your righteousness because of my enemies; Make Your way straight before my face.9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; Their inward part is destruction; Their throat is an open tomb; They flatter with their tongue.10 Pronounce them guilty, O God! Let them fall by their own counsels; Cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions, For they have rebelled against You.11 But let all those rejoice who put their trust in You; Let them ever shout for joy, because You defend them; Let those also who love Your name Be joyful in You.12 For You, O Lord , will bless the righteous; With favor You will surround him as with a shield.
