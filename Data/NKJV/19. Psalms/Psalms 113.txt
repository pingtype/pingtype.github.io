1 Praise the Lord ! Praise, O servants of the Lord , Praise the name of the Lord !2 Blessed be the name of the Lord From this time forth and forevermore!3 From the rising of the sun to its going down The Lord 's name is to be praised.4 The Lord is high above all nations, His glory above the heavens.5 Who is like the Lord our God, Who dwells on high,6 Who humbles Himself to behold The things that are in the heavens and in the earth?7 He raises the poor out of the dust, And lifts the needy out of the ash heap,8 That He may seat him with princes- With the princes of His people.9 He grants the barren woman a home, Like a joyful mother of children. Praise the Lord !
