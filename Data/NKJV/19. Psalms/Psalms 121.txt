1 I will lift up my eyes to the hills- From whence comes my help?2 My help comes from the Lord , Who made heaven and earth.3 He will not allow your foot to be moved; He who keeps you will not slumber.4 Behold, He who keeps Israel Shall neither slumber nor sleep.5 The Lord is your keeper; The Lord is your shade at your right hand.6 The sun shall not strike you by day, Nor the moon by night.7 The Lord shall preserve you from all evil; He shall preserve your soul.8 The Lord shall preserve your going out and your coming in From this time forth, and even forevermore.
