1 Be merciful to me, O God, for man would swallow me up; Fighting all day he oppresses me.2 My enemies would hound me all day, For there are many who fight against me, O Most High.3 Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in You.4 In God (I will praise His word), In God I have put my trust; I will not fear. What can flesh do to me?5 All day they twist my words; All their thoughts are against me for evil.6 They gather together, They hide, they mark my steps, When they lie in wait for my life.7 Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, O God!8 You number my wanderings; Put my tears into Your bottle; Are they not in Your book?9 When I cry out to You, Then my enemies will turn back; This I know, because God is for me.10 In God (I will praise His word), In the Lord (I will praise His word),11 In God I have put my trust; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?12 Vows made to You are binding upon me, O God; I will render praises to You,13 For You have delivered my soul from death. Have You not kept my feet from falling, That I may walk before God In the light of the living?
