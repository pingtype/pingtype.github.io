1 God is our refuge and strength, A very present help in trouble.2 Therefore we will not fear, Even though the earth be removed, And though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;3 Though its waters roar and be troubled, Though the mountains shake with its swelling. Selah4 There is a river whose streams shall make glad the city of God, The holy place of the tabernacle of the Most High.5 God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved; God shall help her, just at the break of dawn.6 The nations raged, the kingdoms were moved; He uttered His voice, the earth melted.7 The Lord of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah8 Come, behold the works of the Lord , Who has made desolations in the earth.9 He makes wars cease to the end of the earth; He breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two; He burns the chariot in the fire.10 Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth!11 The Lord of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah
