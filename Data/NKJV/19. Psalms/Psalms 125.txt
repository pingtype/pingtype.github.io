1 Those who trust in the Lord Are like Mount Zion, Which cannot be moved, but abides forever.2 As the mountains surround Jerusalem, So the Lord surrounds His people From this time forth and forever.3 For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest On the land allotted to the righteous, Lest the righteous reach out their hands to iniquity.4 Do good, O Lord , to those who are good, And to those who are upright in their hearts.5 As for such as turn aside to their crooked ways, The Lord shall lead them away With the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel!
