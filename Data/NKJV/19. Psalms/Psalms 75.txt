1 We give thanks to You, O God, we give thanks! For Your wondrous works declare that Your name is near.2 "When I choose the proper time, I will judge uprightly.3 The earth and all its inhabitants are dissolved; I set up its pillars firmly. Selah4 "I said to the boastful, 'Do not deal boastfully,' And to the wicked, 'Do not lift up the horn.5 Do not lift up your horn on high; Do not speak with a stiff neck.' "6 For exaltation comes neither from the east Nor from the west nor from the south.7 But God is the Judge: He puts down one, And exalts another.8 For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, And the wine is red; It is fully mixed, and He pours it out; Surely its dregs shall all the wicked of the earth Drain and drink down.9 But I will declare forever, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.10 "All the horns of the wicked I will also cut off, But the horns of the righteous shall be exalted."
