1 I was glad when they said to me, "Let us go into the house of the Lord ."2 Our feet have been standing Within your gates, O Jerusalem!3 Jerusalem is built As a city that is compact together,4 Where the tribes go up, The tribes of the Lord , To the Testimony of Israel, To give thanks to the name of the Lord .5 For thrones are set there for judgment, The thrones of the house of David.6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: "May they prosper who love you.7 Peace be within your walls, Prosperity within your palaces."8 For the sake of my brethren and companions, I will now say, "Peace be within you."9 Because of the house of the Lord our God I will seek your good.
