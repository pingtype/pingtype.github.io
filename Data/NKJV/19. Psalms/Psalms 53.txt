1 The fool has said in his heart, " There is no God." They are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity; There is none who does good.2 God looks down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there are any who understand, who seek God.3 Every one of them has turned aside; They have together become corrupt; There is none who does good, No, not one.4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people as they eat bread, And do not call upon God?5 There they are in great fear Where no fear was, For God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you; You have put them to shame, Because God has despised them.6 Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When God brings back the captivity of His people, Let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad.
