1 Make a joyful shout to God, all the earth!2 Sing out the honor of His name; Make His praise glorious.3 Say to God, "How awesome are Your works! Through the greatness of Your power Your enemies shall submit themselves to You.4 All the earth shall worship You And sing praises to You; They shall sing praises to Your name." Selah5 Come and see the works of God; He is awesome in His doing toward the sons of men.6 He turned the sea into dry land; They went through the river on foot. There we will rejoice in Him.7 He rules by His power forever; His eyes observe the nations; Do not let the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah8 Oh, bless our God, you peoples! And make the voice of His praise to be heard,9 Who keeps our soul among the living, And does not allow our feet to be moved.10 For You, O God, have tested us; You have refined us as silver is refined.11 You brought us into the net; You laid affliction on our backs.12 You have caused men to ride over our heads; We went through fire and through water; But You brought us out to rich fulfillment.13 I will go into Your house with burnt offerings; I will pay You my vows,14 Which my lips have uttered And my mouth has spoken when I was in trouble.15 I will offer You burnt sacrifices of fat animals, With the sweet aroma of rams; I will offer bulls with goats. Selah16 Come and hear, all you who fear God, And I will declare what He has done for my soul.17 I cried to Him with my mouth, And He was extolled with my tongue.18 If I regard iniquity in my heart, The Lord will not hear.19 But certainly God has heard me; He has attended to the voice of my prayer.20 Blessed be God, Who has not turned away my prayer, Nor His mercy from me!
