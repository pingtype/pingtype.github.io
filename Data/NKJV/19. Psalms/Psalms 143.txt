1 Hear my prayer, O Lord , Give ear to my supplications! In Your faithfulness answer me, And in Your righteousness.2 Do not enter into judgment with Your servant, For in Your sight no one living is righteous.3 For the enemy has persecuted my soul; He has crushed my life to the ground; He has made me dwell in darkness, Like those who have long been dead.4 Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me; My heart within me is distressed.5 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Your works; I muse on the work of Your hands.6 I spread out my hands to You; My soul longs for You like a thirsty land. Selah7 Answer me speedily, O Lord ; My spirit fails! Do not hide Your face from me, Lest I be like those who go down into the pit.8 Cause me to hear Your lovingkindness in the morning, For in You do I trust; Cause me to know the way in which I should walk, For I lift up my soul to You.9 Deliver me, O Lord , from my enemies; In You I take shelter.10 Teach me to do Your will, For You are my God; Your Spirit is good. Lead me in the land of uprightness.11 Revive me, O Lord , for Your name's sake! For Your righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.12 In Your mercy cut off my enemies, And destroy all those who afflict my soul; For I am Your servant.
