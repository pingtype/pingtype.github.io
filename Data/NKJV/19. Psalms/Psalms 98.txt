1 Oh, sing to the Lord a new song! For He has done marvelous things; His right hand and His holy arm have gained Him the victory.2 The Lord has made known His salvation; His righteousness He has revealed in the sight of the nations.3 He has remembered His mercy and His faithfulness to the house of Israel; All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.4 Shout joyfully to the Lord , all the earth; Break forth in song, rejoice, and sing praises.5 Sing to the Lord with the harp, With the harp and the sound of a psalm,6 With trumpets and the sound of a horn; Shout joyfully before the Lord , the King.7 Let the sea roar, and all its fullness, The world and those who dwell in it;8 Let the rivers clap their hands; Let the hills be joyful together before the Lord ,9 For He is coming to judge the earth. With righteousness He shall judge the world, And the peoples with equity.
