1 His foundation is in the holy mountains.2 The Lord loves the gates of Zion More than all the dwellings of Jacob.3 Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God! Selah4 "I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to those who know Me; Behold, O Philistia and Tyre, with Ethiopia: 'This one was born there.' "5 And of Zion it will be said, "This one and that one were born in her; And the Most High Himself shall establish her."6 The Lord will record, When He registers the peoples: "This one was born there." Selah7 Both the singers and the players on instruments say, "All my springs are in you."
