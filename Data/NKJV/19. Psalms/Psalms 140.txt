1 Deliver me, O Lord , from evil men; Preserve me from violent men,2 Who plan evil things in their hearts; They continually gather together for war.3 They sharpen their tongues like a serpent; The poison of asps is under their lips. Selah4 Keep me, O Lord , from the hands of the wicked; Preserve me from violent men, Who have purposed to make my steps stumble.5 The proud have hidden a snare for me, and cords; They have spread a net by the wayside; They have set traps for me. Selah6 I said to the Lord : "You are my God; Hear the voice of my supplications, O Lord .7 O G od the Lord, the strength of my salvation, You have covered my head in the day of battle.8 Do not grant, O Lord , the desires of the wicked; Do not further his wicked scheme, Lest they be exalted. Selah9 " As for the head of those who surround me, Let the evil of their lips cover them;10 Let burning coals fall upon them; Let them be cast into the fire, Into deep pits, that they rise not up again.11 Let not a slanderer be established in the earth; Let evil hunt the violent man to overthrow him. "12 I know that the Lord will maintain The cause of the afflicted, And justice for the poor.13 Surely the righteous shall give thanks to Your name; The upright shall dwell in Your presence.
