1 Lord , I cry out to You; Make haste to me! Give ear to my voice when I cry out to You.2 Let my prayer be set before You as incense, The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.3 Set a guard, O Lord , over my mouth; Keep watch over the door of my lips.4 Do not incline my heart to any evil thing, To practice wicked works With men who work iniquity; And do not let me eat of their delicacies.5 Let the righteous strike me; It shall be a kindness. And let him rebuke me; It shall be as excellent oil; Let my head not refuse it. For still my prayer is against the deeds of the wicked.6 Their judges are overthrown by the sides of the cliff, And they hear my words, for they are sweet.7 Our bones are scattered at the mouth of the grave, As when one plows and breaks up the earth.8 But my eyes are upon You, O G od the Lord; In You I take refuge; Do not leave my soul destitute.9 Keep me from the snares they have laid for me, And from the traps of the workers of iniquity.10 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, While I escape safely.
