1 The fool has said in his heart, " There is no God." They are corrupt, They have done abominable works, There is none who does good.2 The Lord looks down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there are any who understand, who seek God.3 They have all turned aside, They have together become corrupt; There is none who does good, No, not one.4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people as they eat bread, And do not call on the Lord ?5 There they are in great fear, For God is with the generation of the righteous.6 You shame the counsel of the poor, But the Lord is his refuge.7 Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When the Lord brings back the captivity of His people, Let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad.
