1 I will extol You, O Lord , for You have lifted me up, And have not let my foes rejoice over me.2 O Lord my God, I cried out to You, And You healed me.3 O Lord , You brought my soul up from the grave; You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.4 Sing praise to the Lord , you saints of His, And give thanks at the remembrance of His holy name.5 For His anger is but for a moment, His favor is for life; Weeping may endure for a night, But joy comes in the morning.6 Now in my prosperity I said, "I shall never be moved."7 Lord , by Your favor You have made my mountain stand strong; You hid Your face, and I was troubled.8 I cried out to You, O Lord ; And to the Lord I made supplication:9 "What profit is there in my blood, When I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise You? Will it declare Your truth?10 Hear, O Lord , and have mercy on me; Lord , be my helper!"11 You have turned for me my mourning into dancing; You have put off my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness,12 To the end that my glory may sing praise to You and not be silent. O Lord my God, I will give thanks to You forever.
