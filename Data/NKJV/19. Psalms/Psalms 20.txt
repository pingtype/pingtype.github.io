1 May the Lord answer you in the day of trouble; May the name of the God of Jacob defend you;2 May He send you help from the sanctuary, And strengthen you out of Zion;3 May He remember all your offerings, And accept your burnt sacrifice. Selah4 May He grant you according to your heart's desire, And fulfill all your purpose.5 We will rejoice in your salvation, And in the name of our God we will set up our banners! May the Lord fulfill all your petitions.6 Now I know that the Lord saves His anointed; He will answer him from His holy heaven With the saving strength of His right hand.7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; But we will remember the name of the Lord our God.8 They have bowed down and fallen; But we have risen and stand upright.9 Save, Lord ! May the King answer us when we call.
