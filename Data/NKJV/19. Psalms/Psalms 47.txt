1 Oh, clap your hands, all you peoples! Shout to God with the voice of triumph!2 For the Lord Most High is awesome; He is a great King over all the earth.3 He will subdue the peoples under us, And the nations under our feet.4 He will choose our inheritance for us, The excellence of Jacob whom He loves. Selah5 God has gone up with a shout, The Lord with the sound of a trumpet.6 Sing praises to God, sing praises! Sing praises to our King, sing praises!7 For God is the King of all the earth; Sing praises with understanding.8 God reigns over the nations; God sits on His holy throne.9 The princes of the people have gathered together, The people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of the earth belong to God; He is greatly exalted.
