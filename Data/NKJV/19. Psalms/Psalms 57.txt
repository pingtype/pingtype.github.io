1 Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me! For my soul trusts in You; And in the shadow of Your wings I will make my refuge, Until these calamities have passed by.2 I will cry out to God Most High, To God who performs all things for me.3 He shall send from heaven and save me; He reproaches the one who would swallow me up. Selah God shall send forth His mercy and His truth.4 My soul is among lions; I lie among the sons of men Who are set on fire, Whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword.5 Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; Let Your glory be above all the earth.6 They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down; They have dug a pit before me; Into the midst of it they themselves have fallen. Selah7 My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing and give praise.8 Awake, my glory! Awake, lute and harp! I will awaken the dawn.9 I will praise You, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing to You among the nations.10 For Your mercy reaches unto the heavens, And Your truth unto the clouds.11 Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; Let Your glory be above all the earth.
