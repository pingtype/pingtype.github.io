1 The Lord reigns; Let the earth rejoice; Let the multitude of isles be glad!2 Clouds and darkness surround Him; Righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne.3 A fire goes before Him, And burns up His enemies round about.4 His lightnings light the world; The earth sees and trembles.5 The mountains melt like wax at the presence of the Lord , At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.6 The heavens declare His righteousness, And all the peoples see His glory.7 Let all be put to shame who serve carved images, Who boast of idols. Worship Him, all you gods.8 Zion hears and is glad, And the daughters of Judah rejoice Because of Your judgments, O Lord .9 For You, Lord , are most high above all the earth; You are exalted far above all gods.10 You who love the Lord , hate evil! He preserves the souls of His saints; He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked.11 Light is sown for the righteous, And gladness for the upright in heart.12 Rejoice in the Lord , you righteous, And give thanks at the remembrance of His holy name.
