1 "Many a time they have afflicted me from my youth," Let Israel now say-2 "Many a time they have afflicted me from my youth; Yet they have not prevailed against me.3 The plowers plowed on my back; They made their furrows long."4 The Lord is righteous; He has cut in pieces the cords of the wicked.5 Let all those who hate Zion Be put to shame and turned back.6 Let them be as the grass on the housetops, Which withers before it grows up,7 With which the reaper does not fill his hand, Nor he who binds sheaves, his arms.8 Neither let those who pass by them say, "The blessing of the Lord be upon you; We bless you in the name of the Lord !"
