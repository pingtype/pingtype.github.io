1 I cry out to the Lord with my voice; With my voice to the Lord I make my supplication.2 I pour out my complaint before Him; I declare before Him my trouble.3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, Then You knew my path. In the way in which I walk They have secretly set a snare for me.4 Look on my right hand and see, For there is no one who acknowledges me; Refuge has failed me; No one cares for my soul.5 I cried out to You, O Lord : I said, "You are my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.6 Attend to my cry, For I am brought very low; Deliver me from my persecutors, For they are stronger than I.7 Bring my soul out of prison, That I may praise Your name; The righteous shall surround me, For You shall deal bountifully with me."
