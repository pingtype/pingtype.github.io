1 My heart is overflowing with a good theme; I recite my composition concerning the King; My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.2 You are fairer than the sons of men; Grace is poured upon Your lips; Therefore God has blessed You forever.3 Gird Your sword upon Your thigh, O Mighty One, With Your glory and Your majesty.4 And in Your majesty ride prosperously because of truth, humility, and righteousness; And Your right hand shall teach You awesome things.5 Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the King's enemies; The peoples fall under You.6 Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom.7 You love righteousness and hate wickedness; Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You With the oil of gladness more than Your companions.8 All Your garments are scented with myrrh and aloes and cassia, Out of the ivory palaces, by which they have made You glad.9 Kings' daughters are among Your honorable women; At Your right hand stands the queen in gold from Ophir.10 Listen, O daughter, Consider and incline your ear; Forget your own people also, and your father's house;11 So the King will greatly desire your beauty; Because He is your Lord, worship Him.12 And the daughter of Tyre will come with a gift; The rich among the people will seek your favor.13 The royal daughter is all glorious within the palace; Her clothing is woven with gold.14 She shall be brought to the King in robes of many colors; The virgins, her companions who follow her, shall be brought to You.15 With gladness and rejoicing they shall be brought; They shall enter the King's palace.16 Instead of Your fathers shall be Your sons, Whom You shall make princes in all the earth.17 I will make Your name to be remembered in all generations; Therefore the people shall praise You forever and ever.
