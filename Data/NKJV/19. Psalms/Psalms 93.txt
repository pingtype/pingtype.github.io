1 The Lord reigns, He is clothed with majesty; The Lord is clothed, He has girded Himself with strength. Surely the world is established, so that it cannot be moved.2 Your throne is established from of old; You are from everlasting.3 The floods have lifted up, O Lord , The floods have lifted up their voice; The floods lift up their waves.4 The Lord on high is mightier Than the noise of many waters, Than the mighty waves of the sea.5 Your testimonies are very sure; Holiness adorns Your house, O Lord , forever.
