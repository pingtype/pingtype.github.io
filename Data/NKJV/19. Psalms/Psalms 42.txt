1 As the deer pants for the water brooks, So pants my soul for You, O God.2 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God?3 My tears have been my food day and night, While they continually say to me, "Where is your God?"4 When I remember these things, I pour out my soul within me. For I used to go with the multitude; I went with them to the house of God, With the voice of joy and praise, With a multitude that kept a pilgrim feast.5 Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him For the help of His countenance.6 O my God, my soul is cast down within me; Therefore I will remember You from the land of the Jordan, And from the heights of Hermon, From the Hill Mizar.7 Deep calls unto deep at the noise of Your waterfalls; All Your waves and billows have gone over me.8 The Lord will command His lovingkindness in the daytime, And in the night His song shall be with me- A prayer to the God of my life.9 I will say to God my Rock, "Why have You forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?"10 As with a breaking of my bones, My enemies reproach me, While they say to me all day long, "Where is your God?"11 Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God; For I shall yet praise Him, The help of my countenance and my God.
