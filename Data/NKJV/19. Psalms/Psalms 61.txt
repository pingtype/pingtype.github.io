1 Hear my cry, O God; Attend to my prayer.2 From the end of the earth I will cry to You, When my heart is overwhelmed; Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.3 For You have been a shelter for me, A strong tower from the enemy.4 I will abide in Your tabernacle forever; I will trust in the shelter of Your wings. Selah5 For You, O God, have heard my vows; You have given me the heritage of those who fear Your name.6 You will prolong the king's life, His years as many generations.7 He shall abide before God forever. Oh, prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him!8 So I will sing praise to Your name forever, That I may daily perform my vows.
