1 Praise the Lord ! I will praise the Lord with my whole heart, In the assembly of the upright and in the congregation.2 The works of the Lord are great, Studied by all who have pleasure in them.3 His work is honorable and glorious, And His righteousness endures forever.4 He has made His wonderful works to be remembered; The Lord is gracious and full of compassion.5 He has given food to those who fear Him; He will ever be mindful of His covenant.6 He has declared to His people the power of His works, In giving them the heritage of the nations.7 The works of His hands are verity and justice; All His precepts are sure.8 They stand fast forever and ever, And are done in truth and uprightness.9 He has sent redemption to His people; He has commanded His covenant forever: Holy and awesome is His name.10 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; A good understanding have all those who do His commandments. His praise endures forever.
