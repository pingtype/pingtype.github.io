1 The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool."2 The Lord shall send the rod of Your strength out of Zion. Rule in the midst of Your enemies!3 Your people shall be volunteers In the day of Your power; In the beauties of holiness, from the womb of the morning, You have the dew of Your youth.4 The Lord has sworn And will not relent, "You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek."5 The Lord is at Your right hand; He shall execute kings in the day of His wrath.6 He shall judge among the nations, He shall fill the places with dead bodies, He shall execute the heads of many countries.7 He shall drink of the brook by the wayside; Therefore He shall lift up the head.
