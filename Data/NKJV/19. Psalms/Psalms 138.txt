1 I will praise You with my whole heart; Before the gods I will sing praises to You.2 I will worship toward Your holy temple, And praise Your name For Your lovingkindness and Your truth; For You have magnified Your word above all Your name.3 In the day when I cried out, You answered me, And made me bold with strength in my soul.4 All the kings of the earth shall praise You, O Lord , When they hear the words of Your mouth.5 Yes, they shall sing of the ways of the Lord , For great is the glory of the Lord .6 Though the Lord is on high, Yet He regards the lowly; But the proud He knows from afar.7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, You will revive me; You will stretch out Your hand Against the wrath of my enemies, And Your right hand will save me.8 The Lord will perfect that which concerns me; Your mercy, O Lord , endures forever; Do not forsake the works of Your hands.
