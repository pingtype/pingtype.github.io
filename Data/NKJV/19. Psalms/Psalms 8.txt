1 O Lord , our Lord, How excellent is Your name in all the earth, Who have set Your glory above the heavens!2 Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have ordained strength, Because of Your enemies, That You may silence the enemy and the avenger.3 When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, The moon and the stars, which You have ordained,4 What is man that You are mindful of him, And the son of man that You visit him?5 For You have made him a little lower than the angels, And You have crowned him with glory and honor.6 You have made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet,7 All sheep and oxen- Even the beasts of the field,8 The birds of the air, And the fish of the sea That pass through the paths of the seas.9 O Lord , our Lord, How excellent is Your name in all the earth!
