1 Praise the Lord ! Praise the Lord , O my soul!2 While I live I will praise the Lord ; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being.3 Do not put your trust in princes, Nor in a son of man, in whom there is no help.4 His spirit departs, he returns to his earth; In that very day his plans perish.5 Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, Whose hope is in the Lord his God,6 Who made heaven and earth, The sea, and all that is in them; Who keeps truth forever,7 Who executes justice for the oppressed, Who gives food to the hungry. The Lord gives freedom to the prisoners.8 The Lord opens the eyes of the blind; The Lord raises those who are bowed down; The Lord loves the righteous.9 The Lord watches over the strangers; He relieves the fatherless and widow; But the way of the wicked He turns upside down.10 The Lord shall reign forever- Your God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise the Lord !
