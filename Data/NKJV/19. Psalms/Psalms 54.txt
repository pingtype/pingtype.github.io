1 Save me, O God, by Your name, And vindicate me by Your strength.2 Hear my prayer, O God; Give ear to the words of my mouth.3 For strangers have risen up against me, And oppressors have sought after my life; They have not set God before them. Selah4 Behold, God is my helper; The Lord is with those who uphold my life.5 He will repay my enemies for their evil. Cut them off in Your truth.6 I will freely sacrifice to You; I will praise Your name, O Lord , for it is good.7 For He has delivered me out of all trouble; And my eye has seen its desire upon my enemies.
