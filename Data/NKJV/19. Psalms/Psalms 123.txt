1 Unto You I lift up my eyes, O You who dwell in the heavens.2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their masters, As the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, So our eyes look to the Lord our God, Until He has mercy on us.3 Have mercy on us, O Lord , have mercy on us! For we are exceedingly filled with contempt.4 Our soul is exceedingly filled With the scorn of those who are at ease, With the contempt of the proud.
