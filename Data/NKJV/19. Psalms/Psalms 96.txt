1 Oh, sing to the Lord a new song! Sing to the Lord , all the earth.2 Sing to the Lord , bless His name; Proclaim the good news of His salvation from day to day.3 Declare His glory among the nations, His wonders among all peoples.4 For the Lord is great and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.5 For all the gods of the peoples are idols, But the Lord made the heavens.6 Honor and majesty are before Him; Strength and beauty are in His sanctuary.7 Give to the Lord , O families of the peoples, Give to the Lord glory and strength.8 Give to the Lord the glory due His name; Bring an offering, and come into His courts.9 Oh, worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness! Tremble before Him, all the earth.10 Say among the nations, "The Lord reigns; The world also is firmly established, It shall not be moved; He shall judge the peoples righteously."11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; Let the sea roar, and all its fullness;12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it. Then all the trees of the woods will rejoice before the Lord .13 For He is coming, for He is coming to judge the earth. He shall judge the world with righteousness, And the peoples with His truth.
