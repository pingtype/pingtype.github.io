1 Truly my soul silently waits for God; From Him comes my salvation.2 He only is my rock and my salvation; He is my defense; I shall not be greatly moved.3 How long will you attack a man? You shall be slain, all of you, Like a leaning wall and a tottering fence.4 They only consult to cast him down from his high position; They delight in lies; They bless with their mouth, But they curse inwardly. Selah5 My soul, wait silently for God alone, For my expectation is from Him.6 He only is my rock and my salvation; He is my defense; I shall not be moved.7 In God is my salvation and my glory; The rock of my strength, And my refuge, is in God.8 Trust in Him at all times, you people; Pour out your heart before Him; God is a refuge for us. Selah9 Surely men of low degree are a vapor, Men of high degree are a lie; If they are weighed on the scales, They are altogether lighter than vapor.10 Do not trust in oppression, Nor vainly hope in robbery; If riches increase, Do not set your heart on them.11 God has spoken once, Twice I have heard this: That power belongs to God.12 Also to You, O Lord, belongs mercy; For You render to each one according to his work.
