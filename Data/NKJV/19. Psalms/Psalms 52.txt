1 Why do you boast in evil, O mighty man? The goodness of God endures continually.2 Your tongue devises destruction, Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.3 You love evil more than good, Lying rather than speaking righteousness. Selah4 You love all devouring words, You deceitful tongue.5 God shall likewise destroy you forever; He shall take you away, and pluck you out of your dwelling place, And uproot you from the land of the living. Selah6 The righteous also shall see and fear, And shall laugh at him, saying,7 "Here is the man who did not make God his strength, But trusted in the abundance of his riches, And strengthened himself in his wickedness."8 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the mercy of God forever and ever.9 I will praise You forever, Because You have done it; And in the presence of Your saints I will wait on Your name, for it is good.
