1 How lovely is Your tabernacle, O Lord of hosts!2 My soul longs, yes, even faints For the courts of the Lord ; My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.3 Even the sparrow has found a home, And the swallow a nest for herself, Where she may lay her young- Even Your altars, O Lord of hosts, My King and my God.4 Blessed are those who dwell in Your house; They will still be praising You. Selah5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in You, Whose heart is set on pilgrimage.6 As they pass through the Valley of Baca, They make it a spring; The rain also covers it with pools.7 They go from strength to strength; Each one appears before God in Zion.8 O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer; Give ear, O God of Jacob! Selah9 O God, behold our shield, And look upon the face of Your anointed.10 For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God Than dwell in the tents of wickedness.11 For the Lord God is a sun and shield; The Lord will give grace and glory; No good thing will He withhold From those who walk uprightly.12 O Lord of hosts, Blessed is the man who trusts in You!
