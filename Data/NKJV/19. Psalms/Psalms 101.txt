1 I will sing of mercy and justice; To You, O Lord , I will sing praises.2 I will behave wisely in a perfect way. Oh, when will You come to me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.3 I will set nothing wicked before my eyes; I hate the work of those who fall away; It shall not cling to me.4 A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will not know wickedness.5 Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor, Him I will destroy; The one who has a haughty look and a proud heart, Him I will not endure.6 My eyes shall be on the faithful of the land, That they may dwell with me; He who walks in a perfect way, He shall serve me.7 He who works deceit shall not dwell within my house; He who tells lies shall not continue in my presence.8 Early I will destroy all the wicked of the land, That I may cut off all the evildoers from the city of the Lord .
