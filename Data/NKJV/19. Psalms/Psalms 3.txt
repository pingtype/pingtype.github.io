1 Lord , how they have increased who trouble me! Many are they who rise up against me.2 Many are they who say of me, " There is no help for him in God." Selah3 But You, O Lord , are a shield for me, My glory and the One who lifts up my head.4 I cried to the Lord with my voice, And He heard me from His holy hill. Selah5 I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the Lord sustained me.6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people Who have set themselves against me all around.7 Arise, O Lord ; Save me, O my God! For You have struck all my enemies on the cheekbone; You have broken the teeth of the ungodly.8 Salvation belongs to the Lord . Your blessing is upon Your people. Selah
