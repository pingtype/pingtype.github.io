1 Praise the Lord ! Praise the Lord from the heavens; Praise Him in the heights!2 Praise Him, all His angels; Praise Him, all His hosts!3 Praise Him, sun and moon; Praise Him, all you stars of light!4 Praise Him, you heavens of heavens, And you waters above the heavens!5 Let them praise the name of the Lord , For He commanded and they were created.6 He also established them forever and ever; He made a decree which shall not pass away.7 Praise the Lord from the earth, You great sea creatures and all the depths;8 Fire and hail, snow and clouds; Stormy wind, fulfilling His word;9 Mountains and all hills; Fruitful trees and all cedars;10 Beasts and all cattle; Creeping things and flying fowl;11 Kings of the earth and all peoples; Princes and all judges of the earth;12 Both young men and maidens; Old men and children.13 Let them praise the name of the Lord , For His name alone is exalted; His glory is above the earth and heaven.14 And He has exalted the horn of His people, The praise of all His saints- Of the children of Israel, A people near to Him. Praise the Lord !
