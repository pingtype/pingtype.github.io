1 In the Lord I put my trust; How can you say to my soul, "Flee as a bird to your mountain"?2 For look! The wicked bend their bow, They make ready their arrow on the string, That they may shoot secretly at the upright in heart.3 If the foundations are destroyed, What can the righteous do?4 The Lord is in His holy temple, The Lord 's throne is in heaven; His eyes behold, His eyelids test the sons of men.5 The Lord tests the righteous, But the wicked and the one who loves violence His soul hates.6 Upon the wicked He will rain coals; Fire and brimstone and a burning wind Shall be the portion of their cup.7 For the Lord is righteous, He loves righteousness; His countenance beholds the upright.
