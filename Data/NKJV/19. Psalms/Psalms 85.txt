1 Lord , You have been favorable to Your land; You have brought back the captivity of Jacob.2 You have forgiven the iniquity of Your people; You have covered all their sin. Selah3 You have taken away all Your wrath; You have turned from the fierceness of Your anger.4 Restore us, O God of our salvation, And cause Your anger toward us to cease.5 Will You be angry with us forever? Will You prolong Your anger to all generations?6 Will You not revive us again, That Your people may rejoice in You?7 Show us Your mercy, Lord , And grant us Your salvation.8 I will hear what God the Lord will speak, For He will speak peace To His people and to His saints; But let them not turn back to folly.9 Surely His salvation is near to those who fear Him, That glory may dwell in our land.10 Mercy and truth have met together; Righteousness and peace have kissed.11 Truth shall spring out of the earth, And righteousness shall look down from heaven.12 Yes, the Lord will give what is good; And our land will yield its increase.13 Righteousness will go before Him, And shall make His footsteps our pathway.
