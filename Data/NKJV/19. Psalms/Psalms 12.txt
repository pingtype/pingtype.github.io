1 Help, Lord , for the godly man ceases! For the faithful disappear from among the sons of men.2 They speak idly everyone with his neighbor; With flattering lips and a double heart they speak.3 May the Lord cut off all flattering lips, And the tongue that speaks proud things,4 Who have said, "With our tongue we will prevail; Our lips are our own; Who is lord over us?"5 "For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, Now I will arise," says the Lord ; "I will set him in the safety for which he yearns."6 The words of the Lord are pure words, Like silver tried in a furnace of earth, Purified seven times.7 You shall keep them, O Lord , You shall preserve them from this generation forever.8 The wicked prowl on every side, When vileness is exalted among the sons of men.
