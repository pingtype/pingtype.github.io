1 To You I will cry, O Lord my Rock: Do not be silent to me, Lest, if You are silent to me, I become like those who go down to the pit.2 Hear the voice of my supplications When I cry to You, When I lift up my hands toward Your holy sanctuary.3 Do not take me away with the wicked And with the workers of iniquity, Who speak peace to their neighbors, But evil is in their hearts.4 Give them according to their deeds, And according to the wickedness of their endeavors; Give them according to the work of their hands; Render to them what they deserve.5 Because they do not regard the works of the Lord , Nor the operation of His hands, He shall destroy them And not build them up.6 Blessed be the Lord , Because He has heard the voice of my supplications!7 The Lord is my strength and my shield; My heart trusted in Him, and I am helped; Therefore my heart greatly rejoices, And with my song I will praise Him.8 The Lord is their strength, And He is the saving refuge of His anointed.9 Save Your people, And bless Your inheritance; Shepherd them also, And bear them up forever.
