1 When the Lord brought back the captivity of Zion, We were like those who dream.2 Then our mouth was filled with laughter, And our tongue with singing. Then they said among the nations, "The Lord has done great things for them."3 The Lord has done great things for us, And we are glad.4 Bring back our captivity, O Lord , As the streams in the South.5 Those who sow in tears Shall reap in joy.6 He who continually goes forth weeping, Bearing seed for sowing, Shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, Bringing his sheaves with him.
