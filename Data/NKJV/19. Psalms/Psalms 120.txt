1 In my distress I cried to the Lord , And He heard me.2 Deliver my soul, O Lord , from lying lips And from a deceitful tongue.3 What shall be given to you, Or what shall be done to you, You false tongue?4 Sharp arrows of the warrior, With coals of the broom tree!5 Woe is me, that I dwell in Meshech, That I dwell among the tents of Kedar!6 My soul has dwelt too long With one who hates peace.7 I am for peace; But when I speak, they are for war.
