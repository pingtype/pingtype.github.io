1 Not unto us, O Lord , not unto us, But to Your name give glory, Because of Your mercy, Because of Your truth.2 Why should the Gentiles say, "So where is their God?"3 But our God is in heaven; He does whatever He pleases.4 Their idols are silver and gold, The work of men's hands.5 They have mouths, but they do not speak; Eyes they have, but they do not see;6 They have ears, but they do not hear; Noses they have, but they do not smell;7 They have hands, but they do not handle; Feet they have, but they do not walk; Nor do they mutter through their throat.8 Those who make them are like them; So is everyone who trusts in them.9 O Israel, trust in the Lord ; He is their help and their shield.10 O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord ; He is their help and their shield.11 You who fear the Lord , trust in the Lord ; He is their help and their shield.12 The Lord has been mindful of us; He will bless us; He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron.13 He will bless those who fear the Lord , Both small and great.14 May the Lord give you increase more and more, You and your children.15 May you be blessed by the Lord , Who made heaven and earth.16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord 's; But the earth He has given to the children of men.17 The dead do not praise the Lord , Nor any who go down into silence.18 But we will bless the Lord From this time forth and forevermore. Praise the Lord !
