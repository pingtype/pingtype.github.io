1 Make haste , O God, to deliver me! Make haste to help me, O Lord !2 Let them be ashamed and confounded Who seek my life; Let them be turned back and confused Who desire my hurt.3 Let them be turned back because of their shame, Who say, "Aha, aha!"4 Let all those who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; And let those who love Your salvation say continually, "Let God be magnified!"5 But I am poor and needy; Make haste to me, O God! You are my help and my deliverer; O Lord , do not delay.
