1 "If it had not been the Lord who was on our side," Let Israel now say-2 "If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, When men rose up against us,3 Then they would have swallowed us alive, When their wrath was kindled against us;4 Then the waters would have overwhelmed us, The stream would have gone over our soul;5 Then the swollen waters Would have gone over our soul."6 Blessed be the Lord , Who has not given us as prey to their teeth.7 Our soul has escaped as a bird from the snare of the fowlers; The snare is broken, and we have escaped.8 Our help is in the name of the Lord , Who made heaven and earth.
