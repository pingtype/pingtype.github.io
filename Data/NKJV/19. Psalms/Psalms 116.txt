1 I love the Lord , because He has heard My voice and my supplications.2 Because He has inclined His ear to me, Therefore I will call upon Him as long as I live.3 The pains of death surrounded me, And the pangs of Sheol laid hold of me; I found trouble and sorrow.4 Then I called upon the name of the Lord : "O Lord , I implore You, deliver my soul!"5 Gracious is the Lord , and righteous; Yes, our God is merciful.6 The Lord preserves the simple; I was brought low, and He saved me.7 Return to your rest, O my soul, For the Lord has dealt bountifully with you.8 For You have delivered my soul from death, My eyes from tears, And my feet from falling.9 I will walk before the Lord In the land of the living.10 I believed, therefore I spoke, "I am greatly afflicted."11 I said in my haste, "All men are liars."12 What shall I render to the Lord For all His benefits toward me?13 I will take up the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of the Lord .14 I will pay my vows to the Lord Now in the presence of all His people.15 Precious in the sight of the Lord Is the death of His saints.16 O Lord , truly I am Your servant; I am Your servant, the son of Your maidservant; You have loosed my bonds.17 I will offer to You the sacrifice of thanksgiving, And will call upon the name of the Lord .18 I will pay my vows to the Lord Now in the presence of all His people,19 In the courts of the Lord 's house, In the midst of you, O Jerusalem. Praise the Lord !
