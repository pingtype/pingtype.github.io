1 Out of the depths I have cried to You, O Lord ;2 Lord, hear my voice! Let Your ears be attentive To the voice of my supplications.3 If You, Lord , should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?4 But there is forgiveness with You, That You may be feared.5 I wait for the Lord , my soul waits, And in His word I do hope.6 My soul waits for the Lord More than those who watch for the morning- Yes, more than those who watch for the morning.7 O Israel, hope in the Lord ; For with the Lord there is mercy, And with Him is abundant redemption.8 And He shall redeem Israel From all his iniquities.
