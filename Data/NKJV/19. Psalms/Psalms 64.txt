1 Hear my voice, O God, in my meditation; Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.2 Hide me from the secret plots of the wicked, From the rebellion of the workers of iniquity,3 Who sharpen their tongue like a sword, And bend their bows to shoot their arrows-bitter words,4 That they may shoot in secret at the blameless; Suddenly they shoot at him and do not fear.5 They encourage themselves in an evil matter; They talk of laying snares secretly; They say, "Who will see them?"6 They devise iniquities: "We have perfected a shrewd scheme." Both the inward thought and the heart of man are deep.7 But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; Suddenly they shall be wounded.8 So He will make them stumble over their own tongue; All who see them shall flee away.9 All men shall fear, And shall declare the work of God; For they shall wisely consider His doing.10 The righteous shall be glad in the Lord , and trust in Him. And all the upright in heart shall glory.
