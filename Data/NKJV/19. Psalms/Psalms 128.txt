1 Blessed is every one who fears the Lord , Who walks in His ways.2 When you eat the labor of your hands, You shall be happy, and it shall be well with you.3 Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine In the very heart of your house, Your children like olive plants All around your table.4 Behold, thus shall the man be blessed Who fears the Lord .5 The Lord bless you out of Zion, And may you see the good of Jerusalem All the days of your life.6 Yes, may you see your children's children. Peace be upon Israel!
