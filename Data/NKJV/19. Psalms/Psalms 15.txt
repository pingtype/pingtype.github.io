1 Lord , who may abide in Your tabernacle? Who may dwell in Your holy hill?2 He who walks uprightly, And works righteousness, And speaks the truth in his heart;3 He who does not backbite with his tongue, Nor does evil to his neighbor, Nor does he take up a reproach against his friend;4 In whose eyes a vile person is despised, But he honors those who fear the Lord ; He who swears to his own hurt and does not change;5 He who does not put out his money at usury, Nor does he take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be moved.
