1 Vindicate me, O Lord , For I have walked in my integrity. I have also trusted in the Lord ; I shall not slip.2 Examine me, O Lord , and prove me; Try my mind and my heart.3 For Your lovingkindness is before my eyes, And I have walked in Your truth.4 I have not sat with idolatrous mortals, Nor will I go in with hypocrites.5 I have hated the assembly of evildoers, And will not sit with the wicked.6 I will wash my hands in innocence; So I will go about Your altar, O Lord ,7 That I may proclaim with the voice of thanksgiving, And tell of all Your wondrous works.8 Lord , I have loved the habitation of Your house, And the place where Your glory dwells.9 Do not gather my soul with sinners, Nor my life with bloodthirsty men,10 In whose hands is a sinister scheme, And whose right hand is full of bribes.11 But as for me, I will walk in my integrity; Redeem me and be merciful to me.12 My foot stands in an even place; In the congregations I will bless the Lord .
