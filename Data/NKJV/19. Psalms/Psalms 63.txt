1 O God, You are my God; Early will I seek You; My soul thirsts for You; My flesh longs for You In a dry and thirsty land Where there is no water.2 So I have looked for You in the sanctuary, To see Your power and Your glory.3 Because Your lovingkindness is better than life, My lips shall praise You.4 Thus I will bless You while I live; I will lift up my hands in Your name.5 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, And my mouth shall praise You with joyful lips.6 When I remember You on my bed, I meditate on You in the night watches.7 Because You have been my help, Therefore in the shadow of Your wings I will rejoice.8 My soul follows close behind You; Your right hand upholds me.9 But those who seek my life, to destroy it, Shall go into the lower parts of the earth.10 They shall fall by the sword; They shall be a portion for jackals.11 But the king shall rejoice in God; Everyone who swears by Him shall glory; But the mouth of those who speak lies shall be stopped.
