1 Make a joyful shout to the Lord , all you lands!2 Serve the Lord with gladness; Come before His presence with singing.3 Know that the Lord , He is God; It is He who has made us, and not we ourselves; We are His people and the sheep of His pasture.4 Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, And into His courts with praise. Be thankful to Him, and bless His name.5 For the Lord is good; His mercy is everlasting, And His truth endures to all generations.
