1 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brethren to dwell together in unity!2 It is like the precious oil upon the head, Running down on the beard, The beard of Aaron, Running down on the edge of his garments.3 It is like the dew of Hermon, Descending upon the mountains of Zion; For there the Lord commanded the blessing- Life forevermore.
