1 The Lord is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; Of whom shall I be afraid?2 When the wicked came against me To eat up my flesh, My enemies and foes, They stumbled and fell.3 Though an army may encamp against me, My heart shall not fear; Though war may rise against me, In this I will be confident.4 One thing I have desired of the Lord , That will I seek: That I may dwell in the house of the Lord All the days of my life, To behold the beauty of the Lord , And to inquire in His temple.5 For in the time of trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion; In the secret place of His tabernacle He shall hide me; He shall set me high upon a rock.6 And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me; Therefore I will offer sacrifices of joy in His tabernacle; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the Lord .7 Hear, O Lord , when I cry with my voice! Have mercy also upon me, and answer me.8 When You said, "Seek My face," My heart said to You, "Your face, Lord , I will seek."9 Do not hide Your face from me; Do not turn Your servant away in anger; You have been my help; Do not leave me nor forsake me, O God of my salvation.10 When my father and my mother forsake me, Then the Lord will take care of me.11 Teach me Your way, O Lord , And lead me in a smooth path, because of my enemies.12 Do not deliver me to the will of my adversaries; For false witnesses have risen against me, And such as breathe out violence.13 I would have lost heart, unless I had believed That I would see the goodness of the Lord In the land of the living.14 Wait on the Lord ; Be of good courage, And He shall strengthen your heart; Wait, I say, on the Lord !
