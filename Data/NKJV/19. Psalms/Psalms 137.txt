1 By the rivers of Babylon, There we sat down, yea, we wept When we remembered Zion.2 We hung our harps Upon the willows in the midst of it.3 For there those who carried us away captive asked of us a song, And those who plundered us requested mirth, Saying, "Sing us one of the songs of Zion!"4 How shall we sing the Lord 's song In a foreign land?5 If I forget you, O Jerusalem, Let my right hand forget its skill!6 If I do not remember you, Let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth- If I do not exalt Jerusalem Above my chief joy.7 Remember, O Lord , against the sons of Edom The day of Jerusalem, Who said, "Raze it, raze it, To its very foundation!"8 O daughter of Babylon, who are to be destroyed, Happy the one who repays you as you have served us!9 Happy the one who takes and dashes Your little ones against the rock!
