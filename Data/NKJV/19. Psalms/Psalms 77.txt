1 I cried out to God with my voice- To God with my voice; And He gave ear to me.2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord; My hand was stretched out in the night without ceasing; My soul refused to be comforted.3 I remembered God, and was troubled; I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah4 You hold my eyelids open; I am so troubled that I cannot speak.5 I have considered the days of old, The years of ancient times.6 I call to remembrance my song in the night; I meditate within my heart, And my spirit makes diligent search.7 Will the Lord cast off forever? And will He be favorable no more?8 Has His mercy ceased forever? Has His promise failed forevermore?9 Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has He in anger shut up His tender mercies? Selah10 And I said, "This is my anguish; But I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High."11 I will remember the works of the Lord ; Surely I will remember Your wonders of old.12 I will also meditate on all Your work, And talk of Your deeds.13 Your way, O God, is in the sanctuary; Who is so great a God as our God?14 You are the God who does wonders; You have declared Your strength among the peoples.15 You have with Your arm redeemed Your people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah16 The waters saw You, O God; The waters saw You, they were afraid; The depths also trembled.17 The clouds poured out water; The skies sent out a sound; Your arrows also flashed about.18 The voice of Your thunder was in the whirlwind; The lightnings lit up the world; The earth trembled and shook.19 Your way was in the sea, Your path in the great waters, And Your footsteps were not known.20 You led Your people like a flock By the hand of Moses and Aaron.
