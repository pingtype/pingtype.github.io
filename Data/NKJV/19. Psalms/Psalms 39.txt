1 I said, "I will guard my ways, Lest I sin with my tongue; I will restrain my mouth with a muzzle, While the wicked are before me."2 I was mute with silence, I held my peace even from good; And my sorrow was stirred up.3 My heart was hot within me; While I was musing, the fire burned. Then I spoke with my tongue:4 " Lord , make me to know my end, And what is the measure of my days, That I may know how frail I am.5 Indeed, You have made my days as handbreadths, And my age is as nothing before You; Certainly every man at his best state is but vapor. Selah6 Surely every man walks about like a shadow; Surely they busy themselves in vain; He heaps up riches, And does not know who will gather them.7 "And now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is in You.8 Deliver me from all my transgressions; Do not make me the reproach of the foolish.9 I was mute, I did not open my mouth, Because it was You who did it.10 Remove Your plague from me; I am consumed by the blow of Your hand.11 When with rebukes You correct man for iniquity, You make his beauty melt away like a moth; Surely every man is vapor. Selah12 "Hear my prayer, O Lord , And give ear to my cry; Do not be silent at my tears; For I am a stranger with You, A sojourner, as all my fathers were.13 Remove Your gaze from me, that I may regain strength, Before I go away and am no more."
