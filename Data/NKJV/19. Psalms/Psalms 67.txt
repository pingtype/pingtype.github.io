1 God be merciful to us and bless us, And cause His face to shine upon us, Selah2 That Your way may be known on earth, Your salvation among all nations.3 Let the peoples praise You, O God; Let all the peoples praise You.4 Oh, let the nations be glad and sing for joy! For You shall judge the people righteously, And govern the nations on earth. Selah5 Let the peoples praise You, O God; Let all the peoples praise You.6 Then the earth shall yield her increase; God, our own God, shall bless us.7 God shall bless us, And all the ends of the earth shall fear Him.
