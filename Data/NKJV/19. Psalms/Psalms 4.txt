1 Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have relieved me in my distress; Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.2 How long, O you sons of men, Will you turn my glory to shame? How long will you love worthlessness And seek falsehood? Selah3 But know that the Lord has set apart for Himself him who is godly; The Lord will hear when I call to Him.4 Be angry, and do not sin. Meditate within your heart on your bed, and be still. Selah5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, And put your trust in the Lord .6 There are many who say, "Who will show us any good?" Lord , lift up the light of Your countenance upon us.7 You have put gladness in my heart, More than in the season that their grain and wine increased.8 I will both lie down in peace, and sleep; For You alone, O Lord , make me dwell in safety.
