1 When Israel went out of Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people of strange language,2 Judah became His sanctuary, And Israel His dominion.3 The sea saw it and fled; Jordan turned back.4 The mountains skipped like rams, The little hills like lambs.5 What ails you, O sea, that you fled? O Jordan, that you turned back?6 O mountains, that you skipped like rams? O little hills, like lambs?7 Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, At the presence of the God of Jacob,8 Who turned the rock into a pool of water, The flint into a fountain of waters.
