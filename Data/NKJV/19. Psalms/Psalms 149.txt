1 Praise the Lord ! Sing to the Lord a new song, And His praise in the assembly of saints.2 Let Israel rejoice in their Maker; Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.3 Let them praise His name with the dance; Let them sing praises to Him with the timbrel and harp.4 For the Lord takes pleasure in His people; He will beautify the humble with salvation.5 Let the saints be joyful in glory; Let them sing aloud on their beds.6 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, And a two-edged sword in their hand,7 To execute vengeance on the nations, And punishments on the peoples;8 To bind their kings with chains, And their nobles with fetters of iron;9 To execute on them the written judgment- This honor have all His saints. Praise the Lord !
