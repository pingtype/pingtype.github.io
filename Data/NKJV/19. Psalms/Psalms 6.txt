1 O Lord , do not rebuke me in Your anger, Nor chasten me in Your hot displeasure.2 Have mercy on me, O Lord , for I am weak; O Lord , heal me, for my bones are troubled.3 My soul also is greatly troubled; But You, O Lord -how long?4 Return, O Lord , deliver me! Oh, save me for Your mercies' sake!5 For in death there is no remembrance of You; In the grave who will give You thanks?6 I am weary with my groaning; All night I make my bed swim; I drench my couch with my tears.7 My eye wastes away because of grief; It grows old because of all my enemies.8 Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity; For the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping.9 The Lord has heard my supplication; The Lord will receive my prayer.10 Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly troubled; Let them turn back and be ashamed suddenly.
