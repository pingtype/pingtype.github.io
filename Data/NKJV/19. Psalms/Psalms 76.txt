1 In Judah God is known; His name is great in Israel.2 In Salem also is His tabernacle, And His dwelling place in Zion.3 There He broke the arrows of the bow, The shield and sword of battle. Selah4 You are more glorious and excellent Than the mountains of prey.5 The stouthearted were plundered; They have sunk into their sleep; And none of the mighty men have found the use of their hands.6 At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both the chariot and horse were cast into a dead sleep.7 You, Yourself, are to be feared; And who may stand in Your presence When once You are angry?8 You caused judgment to be heard from heaven; The earth feared and was still,9 When God arose to judgment, To deliver all the oppressed of the earth. Selah10 Surely the wrath of man shall praise You; With the remainder of wrath You shall gird Yourself.11 Make vows to the Lord your God, and pay them; Let all who are around Him bring presents to Him who ought to be feared.12 He shall cut off the spirit of princes; He is awesome to the kings of the earth.
