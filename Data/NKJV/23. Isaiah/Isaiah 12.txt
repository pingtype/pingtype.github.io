1 And in that day you will say: "O Lord , I will praise You; Though You were angry with me, Your anger is turned away, and You comfort me.2 Behold, God is my salvation, I will trust and not be afraid; 'For Yah , the Lord , is my strength and song; He also has become my salvation.' "3 Therefore with joy you will draw water From the wells of salvation.4 And in that day you will say: "Praise the Lord , call upon His name; Declare His deeds among the peoples, Make mention that His name is exalted.5 Sing to the Lord , For He has done excellent things; This is known in all the earth.6 Cry out and shout, O inhabitant of Zion, For great is the Holy One of Israel in your midst!"
