1 By night on my bed I sought the one I love; I sought him, but I did not find him.2 "I will rise now," I said, "And go about the city; In the streets and in the squares I will seek the one I love." I sought him, but I did not find him.3 The watchmen who go about the city found me; I said, "Have you seen the one I love?"4 Scarcely had I passed by them, When I found the one I love. I held him and would not let him go, Until I had brought him to the house of my mother, And into the chamber of her who conceived me.5 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles or by the does of the field, Do not stir up nor awaken love Until it pleases.The Coming of SolomonThe Shulamite6 Who is this coming out of the wilderness Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all the merchant's fragrant powders?7 Behold, it is Solomon's couch, With sixty valiant men around it, Of the valiant of Israel.8 They all hold swords, Being expert in war. Every man has his sword on his thigh Because of fear in the night.9 Of the wood of Lebanon Solomon the King Made himself a palanquin:10 He made its pillars of silver, Its support of gold, Its seat of purple, Its interior paved with love By the daughters of Jerusalem.11 Go forth, O daughters of Zion, And see King Solomon with the crown With which his mother crowned him On the day of his wedding, The day of the gladness of his heart.
