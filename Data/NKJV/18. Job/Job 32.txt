1 So these three men ceased answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 2 Then the wrath of Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was aroused against Job; his wrath was aroused because he justified himself rather than God. 3 Also against his three friends his wrath was aroused, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.4 Now because they were years older than he, Elihu had waited to speak to Job. 5 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was aroused.6 So Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, answered and said: "I am young in years, and you are very old; Therefore I was afraid, And dared not declare my opinion to you.7 I said, 'Age should speak, And multitude of years should teach wisdom.'8 But there is a spirit in man, And the breath of the Almighty gives him understanding.9 Great men are not always wise, Nor do the aged always understand justice.10 "Therefore I say, 'Listen to me, I also will declare my opinion.'11 Indeed I waited for your words, I listened to your reasonings, while you searched out what to say.12 I paid close attention to you; And surely not one of you convinced Job, Or answered his words-13 Lest you say, 'We have found wisdom'; God will vanquish him, not man.14 Now he has not directed his words against me; So I will not answer him with your words.15 "They are dismayed and answer no more; Words escape them.16 And I have waited, because they did not speak, Because they stood still and answered no more.17 I also will answer my part, I too will declare my opinion.18 For I am full of words; The spirit within me compels me.19 Indeed my belly is like wine that has no vent; It is ready to burst like new wineskins.20 I will speak, that I may find relief; I must open my lips and answer.21 Let me not, I pray, show partiality to anyone; Nor let me flatter any man.22 For I do not know how to flatter, Else my Maker would soon take me away.
