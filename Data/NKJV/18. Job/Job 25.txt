1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:2 "Dominion and fear belong to Him; He makes peace in His high places.3 Is there any number to His armies? Upon whom does His light not rise?4 How then can man be righteous before God? Or how can he be pure who is born of a woman?5 If even the moon does not shine, And the stars are not pure in His sight,6 How much less man, who is a maggot, And a son of man, who is a worm?"
