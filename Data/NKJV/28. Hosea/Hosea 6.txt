1 Come, and let us return to the Lord ; For He has torn, but He will heal us; He has stricken, but He will bind us up.2 After two days He will revive us; On the third day He will raise us up, That we may live in His sight.3 Let us know, Let us pursue the knowledge of the Lord . His going forth is established as the morning; He will come to us like the rain, Like the latter and former rain to the earth.Impenitence of Israel and Judah4 "O Ephraim, what shall I do to you? O Judah, what shall I do to you? For your faithfulness is like a morning cloud, And like the early dew it goes away.5 Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets, I have slain them by the words of My mouth; And your judgments are like light that goes forth.6 For I desire mercy and not sacrifice, And the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.7 "But like men they transgressed the covenant; There they dealt treacherously with Me.8 Gilead is a city of evildoers And defiled with blood.9 As bands of robbers lie in wait for a man, So the company of priests murder on the way to Shechem; Surely they commit lewdness.10 I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel: There is the harlotry of Ephraim; Israel is defiled.11 Also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed for you, When I return the captives of My people.
