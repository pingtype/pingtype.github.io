1 O Israel, return to the Lord your God, For you have stumbled because of your iniquity;2 Take words with you, And return to the Lord . Say to Him, "Take away all iniquity; Receive us graciously, For we will offer the sacrifices of our lips.3 Assyria shall not save us, We will not ride on horses, Nor will we say anymore to the work of our hands, ' You are our gods.' For in You the fatherless finds mercy."4 "I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely, For My anger has turned away from him.5 I will be like the dew to Israel; He shall grow like the lily, And lengthen his roots like Lebanon.6 His branches shall spread; His beauty shall be like an olive tree, And his fragrance like Lebanon.7 Those who dwell under his shadow shall return; They shall be revived like grain, And grow like a vine. Their scent shall be like the wine of Lebanon.8 "Ephraim shall say, 'What have I to do anymore with idols?' I have heard and observed him. I am like a green cypress tree; Your fruit is found in Me."9 Who is wise? Let him understand these things. Who is prudent? Let him know them. For the ways of the Lord are right; The righteous walk in them, But transgressors stumble in them.
