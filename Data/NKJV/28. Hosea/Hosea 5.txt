1 "Hear this, O priests! Take heed, O house of Israel! Give ear, O house of the king! For yours is the judgment, Because you have been a snare to Mizpah And a net spread on Tabor.2 The revolters are deeply involved in slaughter, Though I rebuke them all.3 I know Ephraim, And Israel is not hidden from Me; For now, O Ephraim, you commit harlotry; Israel is defiled.4 "They do not direct their deeds Toward turning to their God, For the spirit of harlotry is in their midst, And they do not know the Lord .5 The pride of Israel testifies to his face; Therefore Israel and Ephraim stumble in their iniquity; Judah also stumbles with them.6 "With their flocks and herds They shall go to seek the Lord , But they will not find Him; He has withdrawn Himself from them.7 They have dealt treacherously with the Lord , For they have begotten pagan children. Now a New Moon shall devour them and their heritage.8 "Blow the ram's horn in Gibeah, The trumpet in Ramah! Cry aloud at Beth Aven, ' Look behind you, O Benjamin!'9 Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke; Among the tribes of Israel I make known what is sure.10 "The princes of Judah are like those who remove a landmark; I will pour out My wrath on them like water.11 Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, Because he willingly walked by human precept.12 Therefore I will be to Ephraim like a moth, And to the house of Judah like rottenness.13 "When Ephraim saw his sickness, And Judah saw his wound, Then Ephraim went to Assyria And sent to King Jareb; Yet he cannot cure you, Nor heal you of your wound.14 For I will be like a lion to Ephraim, And like a young lion to the house of Judah. I, even I, will tear them and go away; I will take them away, and no one shall rescue.15 I will return again to My place Till they acknowledge their offense. Then they will seek My face; In their affliction they will earnestly seek Me."
