1 "When Israel was a child, I loved him, And out of Egypt I called My son.2 As they called them, So they went from them; They sacrificed to the Baals, And burned incense to carved images.3 "I taught Ephraim to walk, Taking them by their arms; But they did not know that I healed them.4 I drew them with gentle cords, With bands of love, And I was to them as those who take the yoke from their neck. I stooped and fed them.5 "He shall not return to the land of Egypt; But the Assyrian shall be his king, Because they refused to repent.6 And the sword shall slash in his cities, Devour his districts, And consume them, Because of their own counsels.7 My people are bent on backsliding from Me. Though they call to the Most High, None at all exalt Him.8 "How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I set you like Zeboiim? My heart churns within Me; My sympathy is stirred.9 I will not execute the fierceness of My anger; I will not again destroy Ephraim. For I am God, and not man, The Holy One in your midst; And I will not come with terror.10 "They shall walk after the Lord . He will roar like a lion. When He roars, Then His sons shall come trembling from the west;11 They shall come trembling like a bird from Egypt, Like a dove from the land of Assyria. And I will let them dwell in their houses," Says the Lord .God's Charge Against Ephraim12 "Ephraim has encircled Me with lies, And the house of Israel with deceit; But Judah still walks with God, Even with the Holy One who is faithful.
