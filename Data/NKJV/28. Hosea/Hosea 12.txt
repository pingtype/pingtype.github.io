1 "Ephraim feeds on the wind, And pursues the east wind; He daily increases lies and desolation. Also they make a covenant with the Assyrians, And oil is carried to Egypt.2 "The Lord also brings a charge against Judah, And will punish Jacob according to his ways; According to his deeds He will recompense him.3 He took his brother by the heel in the womb, And in his strength he struggled with God.4 Yes, he struggled with the Angel and prevailed; He wept, and sought favor from Him. He found Him in Bethel, And there He spoke to us-5 That is, the Lord God of hosts. The Lord is His memorable name.6 So you, by the help of your God, return; Observe mercy and justice, And wait on your God continually.7 "A cunning Canaanite! Deceitful scales are in his hand; He loves to oppress.8 And Ephraim said, 'Surely I have become rich, I have found wealth for myself; In all my labors They shall find in me no iniquity that is sin.'9 "But I am the Lord your God, Ever since the land of Egypt; I will again make you dwell in tents, As in the days of the appointed feast.10 I have also spoken by the prophets, And have multiplied visions; I have given symbols through the witness of the prophets."11 Though Gilead has idols- Surely they are vanity- Though they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal, Indeed their altars shall be heaps in the furrows of the field.12 Jacob fled to the country of Syria; Israel served for a spouse, And for a wife he tended sheep.13 By a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt, And by a prophet he was preserved.14 Ephraim provoked Him to anger most bitterly; Therefore his Lord will leave the guilt of his bloodshed upon him, And return his reproach upon him.
