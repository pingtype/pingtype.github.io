1
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,627
I've heard of you before.

2
00:01:06,103 --> 00:01:06,899
Really?

3
00:01:07,738 --> 00:01:09,467
You major in piano, right?

4
00:01:09,974 --> 00:01:10,770
Yeah.

5
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:14,234
Why did you transfer to our school?

6
00:01:14,445 --> 00:01:15,673
Something wrong with yours?

7
00:01:17,014 --> 00:01:18,038
Your school is more beautiful.

8
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,781
And... My Dad made me.

9
00:01:20,985 --> 00:01:22,612
Hi!

10
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:24,549
Classmate?

11
00:01:24,755 --> 00:01:25,483
Yeah.

12
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:29,619
The school is famous for its piano?

13
00:01:29,994 --> 00:01:32,861
Yeah, we're all very hard-working.

14
00:01:33,197 --> 00:01:34,255
You too, right?

15
00:01:34,832 --> 00:01:35,856
I'm okay.

16
00:01:38,536 --> 00:01:39,468
Look here,

17
00:01:39,904 --> 00:01:42,464
These 2 floors are all piano rooms.

18
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:46,101
You study piano, you'll be here often.

19
00:01:49,146 --> 00:01:50,010
It's beautiful!

20
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,316
This building is over 100 years old.

21
00:01:53,517 --> 00:01:54,347
100 years?

22
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:56,143
But we're tearing it

23
00:01:56,487 --> 00:01:57,579
down on graduation day.

24
00:01:58,356 --> 00:01:59,118
Why?

25
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,381
To build a new one!

26
00:02:01,993 --> 00:02:04,461
We won't be using it
after graduation though.

27
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:06,321
Later students are more fortunate.

28
00:02:07,498 --> 00:02:09,125
Come practice often!

29
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:10,329
Sure.

30
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:14,699
This is a really nice school.

31
00:02:15,172 --> 00:02:16,730
Want me to show you inside?

32
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,440
I'll be fine on my own!

33
00:02:18,976 --> 00:02:20,807
If I get lost, I'll yell for help!

34
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:20,603
Excuse me, were you playing?

35
00:03:21,272 --> 00:03:22,136
No.

36
00:03:25,042 --> 00:03:26,009
There isn't anyone else.

37
00:03:26,444 --> 00:03:27,376
Okay, it was me.

38
00:03:28,746 --> 00:03:29,838
It sounded beautiful.

39
00:03:31,115 --> 00:03:31,945
Thanks.

40
00:03:37,822 --> 00:03:39,016
In 19th century,

41
00:03:39,623 --> 00:03:41,454
there was a musical genius

42
00:03:42,226 --> 00:03:45,127
later known as the piano poet,

43
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:46,090
Sorry I'm late.

44
00:03:46,297 --> 00:03:48,162
That's Chopin.

45
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,094
Why was he a musical genius?

46
00:03:54,705 --> 00:03:57,902
Hey, pay attention in class!

47
00:04:02,646 --> 00:04:05,638
He started learning piano at age of 6,

48
00:04:06,317 --> 00:04:07,841
but when he was 8 years old,

49
00:04:08,352 --> 00:04:10,684
he has already performed publicly

50
00:04:11,222 --> 00:04:13,349
and successfully played a concerto

51
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,281
which made him famous.

52
00:04:16,293 --> 00:04:18,818
But why was he called a piano poet?

53
00:04:19,396 --> 00:04:20,658
Because his work is described

54
00:04:20,865 --> 00:04:24,824
to be fluid and graceful like a poem.

55
00:04:50,661 --> 00:04:51,821
- What?
- Why are you following me?

56
00:04:52,263 --> 00:04:53,025
I'm not.

57
00:04:53,497 --> 00:04:55,988
No? Bye then!

58
00:04:58,035 --> 00:05:00,003
I want to ask you!

59
00:05:00,404 --> 00:05:01,735
What's the name of the song you played?

60
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:02,928
It sounded beautiful!

61
00:05:06,644 --> 00:05:08,441
That's a secret!

62
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,308
What's so secretive about that?

63
00:05:21,992 --> 00:05:22,822
What's your name?

64
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:27,356
I told you already.

65
00:05:28,532 --> 00:05:30,124
I hear you from far away.

66
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:30,966
Let's go.

67
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:34,433
This is a school!
Not a place to pick up girls.

68
00:05:35,773 --> 00:05:37,240
Watch yourself

69
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:39,608
and pay attention in class!

70
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,249
Want me to give you a ride on the way?

71
00:05:59,063 --> 00:06:00,291
How did you know it's on the way?

72
00:06:04,235 --> 00:06:09,571
Why the sudden rain?
You don't have an umbrella?

73
00:06:26,824 --> 00:06:28,018
Why are you so quiet?

74
00:06:28,626 --> 00:06:30,526
It's a secret no matter what I ask.

75
00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:35,526
Which musician do you like?

76
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:39,493
All of them.

77
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:41,861
Do you like the sun or the rain?

78
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,934
Like them both.

79
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:52,071
You play the piano well!

80
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,947
Very well!

81
00:06:54,518 --> 00:06:55,678
Very well!

82
00:06:57,087 --> 00:06:58,054
Will you play for me next time?

83
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:00,045
No!

84
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,949
That's ok. I'll hear it sooner or later.

85
00:07:10,668 --> 00:07:12,295
I'm almost home.

86
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:14,633
Really?

87
00:07:15,673 --> 00:07:19,200
It's fine here, thanks!

88
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,138
It's fine, I'll take you to the door.

89
00:07:20,344 --> 00:07:22,869
I don't want my family to see.

90
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:30,884
Hey, what's your name?

91
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:32,878
I'm Rain.

92
00:07:34,258 --> 00:07:35,225
My name is Jay.

93
00:07:36,694 --> 00:07:37,490
Bye!

94
00:07:58,248 --> 00:07:59,237
Aren't you making dinner?

95
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,819
Right, I almost forgot!

96
00:08:04,254 --> 00:08:06,119
Here, I got it all ready.

97
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,522
That's okay, I'll get it from your Dad.

98
00:08:10,728 --> 00:08:11,490
Really?

99
00:08:11,862 --> 00:08:12,453
Thanks!

100
00:08:12,663 --> 00:08:14,062
You look happy today!

101
00:08:14,498 --> 00:08:14,987
Ok, bye!

102
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,064
Ride carefully! Bye!

103
00:08:45,162 --> 00:08:48,461
Dinner will be ready soon!

104
00:08:55,339 --> 00:09:01,107
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

105
00:09:01,311 --> 00:09:07,147
2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, change.

106
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:09,683
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

107
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,084
Jay, what're you looking for?

108
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:13,419
Nothing.

109
00:09:14,058 --> 00:09:14,888
Looking for someone?

110
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:19,220
Good morning.

111
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,158
Good morning.

112
00:09:25,969 --> 00:09:27,402
Okay, let's look at question 2

113
00:09:28,772 --> 00:09:30,569
and see which student knows the answer.

114
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:33,035
Raise your hands. You!

115
00:09:33,644 --> 00:09:34,838
B, 2nd augmented.

116
00:09:35,112 --> 00:09:36,704
Very good, please sit.

117
00:09:37,681 --> 00:09:39,114
Okay, question 3

118
00:09:40,851 --> 00:09:44,446
The answer is A, sub key of A major.

119
00:10:02,005 --> 00:10:03,063
Did 2 students come in?

120
00:10:09,713 --> 00:10:10,543
He's gone!

121
00:10:12,716 --> 00:10:14,513
You're a standup guy!

122
00:10:15,586 --> 00:10:17,110
Are you new?

123
00:10:17,721 --> 00:10:19,052
Yeah, music class!

124
00:10:20,057 --> 00:10:23,083
I'm Bob, he's Lance.

125
00:10:23,494 --> 00:10:25,155
We're in the rugby team.

126
00:10:26,063 --> 00:10:28,623
He's the captain because he's old.

127
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:30,463
What're you talking about!

128
00:10:31,168 --> 00:10:34,296
I gave my youth to rugby!

129
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:37,937
I've chosen this long
and arduous path

130
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,172
because the school needs me!

131
00:10:40,377 --> 00:10:41,503
Got it?

132
00:10:47,151 --> 00:10:48,641
Pay attention when I'm talking!

133
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,211
Let's go! You don't even study music!

134
00:10:53,056 --> 00:10:55,524
Come watch us play next week, bye!

135
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,151
- Leaving now, bye! - Bye!

136
00:10:59,229 --> 00:11:00,218
The coach is so dumb!

137
00:11:00,597 --> 00:11:01,461
Stupid!

138
00:11:01,798 --> 00:11:05,131
Really dumb!

139
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:13,373
Did I scare you?

140
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:14,805
You scared me!

141
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:17,407
Why weren't you in class?

142
00:11:17,648 --> 00:11:18,774
I was practicing!

143
00:11:21,051 --> 00:11:22,211
Why? You miss me?

144
00:11:23,253 --> 00:11:23,912
Yeah!

145
00:11:25,122 --> 00:11:26,350
I miss your music!

146
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:30,492
But I miss you...

147
00:11:34,364 --> 00:11:35,490
Your music!

148
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,859
The weather is so nice today.

149
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,731
The weather is so nice today.

150
00:12:00,157 --> 00:12:01,488
Come here!

151
00:12:08,131 --> 00:12:08,995
Crouch!

152
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:14,231
Crouch, now!

153
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:15,834
Let's go!

154
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:22,373
How many people in your family?

155
00:12:23,347 --> 00:12:26,544
My family? Just me and my Mom.

156
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:28,147
What about you?

157
00:12:28,352 --> 00:12:29,341
Just me and my Dad.

158
00:12:29,786 --> 00:12:30,844
Just me and my Dad.

159
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:32,353
Stop copying me!

160
00:12:32,556 --> 00:12:33,420
It's true though.

161
00:12:35,592 --> 00:12:36,889
What does your Dad do?

162
00:12:38,395 --> 00:12:39,293
You don't know?

163
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,288
How would I know?

164
00:12:44,401 --> 00:12:45,493
Never mind then.

165
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,030
What's so secretive about that?

166
00:12:48,238 --> 00:12:49,535
You're not the only one with secrets.

167
00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:00,976
So tasty!

168
00:13:02,486 --> 00:13:03,646
I've never had this.

169
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:07,447
Really? Then have more!

170
00:13:10,027 --> 00:13:11,221
Cheers!

171
00:13:11,895 --> 00:13:12,953
Nobody cheers with ice creams!

172
00:13:41,692 --> 00:13:42,818
Jay is gonna start!!

173
00:13:43,093 --> 00:13:44,355
Hurry, or we'll miss it!

174
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:48,097
Hey, you're supposed to...

175
00:13:48,565 --> 00:13:50,362
keep the school lively!

176
00:13:55,605 --> 00:13:57,732
Let's follow the chicks!

177
00:13:59,543 --> 00:14:04,139
The new guy is going to challenge Howe.

178
00:14:05,015 --> 00:14:06,607
What a brave thing to do.

179
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:08,517
Let's applaud to that!

180
00:14:10,587 --> 00:14:11,485
What're they doing?

181
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:13,687
Piano battle, don't you know?

182
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:17,524
Ladies, do you all know me?

183
00:14:17,861 --> 00:14:20,762
Mr. Ice!

184
00:14:21,631 --> 00:14:25,567
That's right! And this is Howe.

185
00:14:26,236 --> 00:14:27,999
Do you all know his nickname?

186
00:14:28,405 --> 00:14:30,999
Prince of piano.

187
00:14:31,608 --> 00:14:34,133
Right, because

188
00:14:34,344 --> 00:14:36,312
there isn't one song he can't play!

189
00:14:36,713 --> 00:14:39,341
And no one can compare to him.

190
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:40,846
What Prince of piano.

191
00:14:41,351 --> 00:14:42,318
- Out of my way! - Okay!

192
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,713
Without further a due,

193
00:14:44,087 --> 00:14:46,851
let's begin with our piano battle!

194
00:15:09,212 --> 00:15:11,578
Whoa, turning black keys to white keys!

195
00:15:23,393 --> 00:15:25,520
New guy, did you listen carefully?

196
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:27,758
Don't you miss a key now!

197
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:09,468
Not bad! You didn't miss one single key!

198
00:16:09,906 --> 00:16:11,703
Looks like we need something harder.

199
00:16:17,614 --> 00:16:21,277
Chopin Waltz? That's too easy.

200
00:16:32,462 --> 00:16:34,487
I knew it wasn't going to be that easy.

201
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:38,329
Come on!

202
00:16:39,436 --> 00:16:40,460
Hey, keep up!

203
00:16:44,474 --> 00:16:46,874
I said keep up, not stand up!

204
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:49,710
Isn't he cute?

205
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:54,383
Even Chopin didn't know this part!

206
00:16:54,885 --> 00:16:56,284
Aren't you all lucky to hear that!

207
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,916
Howe's improvisation is brilliant!

208
00:17:00,423 --> 00:17:01,219
New guy!

209
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:36,423
That's my friend.

210
00:17:39,763 --> 00:17:41,958
It's going to be a good show today!

211
00:17:44,935 --> 00:17:47,961
Howe, keep up...

212
00:19:23,633 --> 00:19:26,124
The battle today is just brilliant!

213
00:19:26,403 --> 00:19:28,337
Let's give them a round of applause!

214
00:19:32,242 --> 00:19:33,504
Okay, back to class!

215
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,143
I'm a man of my words, here.

216
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,272
You're really giving it to him? It's rare!

217
00:19:39,482 --> 00:19:40,346
Thanks!

218
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,915
- That was good! - Okay!

219
00:19:46,122 --> 00:19:46,816
See you in class.

220
00:20:05,108 --> 00:20:06,132
Why do you do that?

221
00:20:07,343 --> 00:20:08,776
I can have a heart attack, you know?

222
00:20:11,815 --> 00:20:12,611
Hungry!

223
00:20:12,816 --> 00:20:13,680
Very hungry!

224
00:20:16,886 --> 00:20:18,444
You like to scare people from the back!

225
00:20:19,823 --> 00:20:21,313
That's because I like your back.

226
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,165
You played well yesterday.

227
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:33,999
You were there?

228
00:20:34,704 --> 00:20:37,298
Yeah, I didn't want to distract you.

229
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:43,143
How can you? No girls can distract me!

230
00:20:44,314 --> 00:20:46,248
I can still play smoothly!

231
00:20:49,586 --> 00:20:51,019
Don't be mad!

232
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:52,820
I'm just kidding.

233
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,591
Why did you battle yesterday?

234
00:21:02,432 --> 00:21:03,421
For this egg!

235
00:21:08,805 --> 00:21:10,898
That's a secret!

236
00:21:11,508 --> 00:21:12,736
Come on!

237
00:21:14,711 --> 00:21:16,872
Jay, Bob and I

238
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,479
are playing for the welcome party,

239
00:21:19,215 --> 00:21:20,773
you played well yesterday,

240
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:23,815
how about I count you in?

241
00:21:27,557 --> 00:21:28,285
Sure!

242
00:21:28,725 --> 00:21:30,920
Then it's a deal! Stick to your words now!

243
00:21:31,594 --> 00:21:32,686
What deal?

244
00:21:39,502 --> 00:21:40,867
Jay, you come here too!

245
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:44,337
See you in the piano room!

246
00:21:49,846 --> 00:21:54,545
Stand straight!

247
00:21:57,053 --> 00:21:58,850
Who said you can eat here?

248
00:21:59,856 --> 00:22:01,414
Does this look like a place to eat?

249
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,288
Would you jog in a cafeteria?

250
00:22:06,863 --> 00:22:08,592
Why don't you tuck in your shirt?

251
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,428
What kind of belt is this?

252
00:22:14,304 --> 00:22:15,669
You think you're a singer?

253
00:22:16,906 --> 00:22:18,271
Is that how to wear a tie?

254
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,110
If you don't cut your hair by tomorrow,

255
00:22:22,312 --> 00:22:23,244
I'll cut it for you!

256
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,277
Girls like it!

257
00:22:25,515 --> 00:22:27,380
Girls like bad appearance?

258
00:22:32,889 --> 00:22:34,550
Got a smoke?

259
00:22:38,728 --> 00:22:41,253
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

260
00:22:41,464 --> 00:22:43,523
Can I have one?

261
00:22:45,468 --> 00:22:46,435
I've got a lighter.

262
00:22:48,504 --> 00:22:49,232
It's okay.

263
00:22:55,612 --> 00:22:57,739
It's been a long time.

264
00:22:59,082 --> 00:22:59,878
Yeah.

265
00:23:00,283 --> 00:23:03,775
Why do you have cigarettes??

266
00:23:06,022 --> 00:23:10,254
8 smokes, 8 laps! Go now!

267
00:23:15,832 --> 00:23:18,665
What kind of friends have you made?

268
00:23:18,868 --> 00:23:20,062
Friends who smoke?

269
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:25,370
Go now!

270
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:41,822
Trying to scare me again?

271
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:44,191
Are they your friends?

272
00:23:45,461 --> 00:23:46,155
Yeah.

273
00:23:46,596 --> 00:23:47,995
They don't look like your friends.

274
00:23:49,198 --> 00:23:50,392
I don't look like your friend.

275
00:23:52,468 --> 00:23:54,766
You're special, I'm ordinary.

276
00:23:54,971 --> 00:23:58,566
I think you're special too!

277
00:24:01,911 --> 00:24:04,778
Being able to meet you has been incredible.

278
00:24:05,748 --> 00:24:06,544
Really?

279
00:24:08,217 --> 00:24:09,809
If I'm a friend to you,

280
00:24:10,353 --> 00:24:13,914
then tell me why are you so mysterious?

281
00:24:14,223 --> 00:24:16,214
I'll tell you if you can catch up to me.

282
00:24:24,968 --> 00:24:26,595
You like to play single-handed.

283
00:24:28,805 --> 00:24:31,501
Because I want to hold your hand
with the other.

284
00:25:28,664 --> 00:25:30,427
I heard 4 hands playing,

285
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:32,193
but you're alone?

286
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,867
I played so fast,

287
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:37,701
you thought there are 2 people.

288
00:25:51,521 --> 00:25:53,489
You students! Unbelievable.

289
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:58,916
I'll pretend I didn't see anything.

290
00:26:02,131 --> 00:26:04,190
Good pianist can get away with things.

291
00:26:05,068 --> 00:26:08,003
Because I'm a good student,
so teachers like me.

292
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,304
Yeah, right!

293
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:23,119
That's Chopin's lover.
They were together for 10 years.

294
00:26:23,853 --> 00:26:25,047
But eventually parted.

295
00:26:26,355 --> 00:26:30,985
To have each other, 10 years is plenty.

296
00:26:35,531 --> 00:26:36,589
Is there something on your mind?

297
00:26:39,836 --> 00:26:41,360
I don't know,

298
00:26:42,705 --> 00:26:44,798
maybe I'll tell you someday.

299
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:48,639
Just cherish our moments together.

300
00:26:50,012 --> 00:26:50,842
Sure!

301
00:26:53,149 --> 00:26:54,241
Let's go!

302
00:26:57,186 --> 00:26:57,914
Where?

303
00:26:58,521 --> 00:27:00,250
Cherish our moments together!

304
00:27:05,695 --> 00:27:06,559
So fast!

305
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,992
Go!

306
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,532
Don't ride so fast!

307
00:27:18,741 --> 00:27:20,106
I'll be home too soon!

308
00:27:22,211 --> 00:27:25,078
Really? Alright then.

309
00:27:36,092 --> 00:27:37,184
It's beautiful!

310
00:27:38,294 --> 00:27:39,192
Want to stop here?

311
00:27:54,076 --> 00:27:55,202
Have you been busy lately?

312
00:27:59,448 --> 00:28:00,676
Dinner is just ready

313
00:28:00,883 --> 00:28:02,475
when I get home.

314
00:28:06,422 --> 00:28:08,287
Don't you think that tastes better?

315
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:16,093
You're dating someone, right?

316
00:28:22,171 --> 00:28:23,934
No, just out with Lance and Bob.

317
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:28,841
Bob and Lance! I knew it!

318
00:28:30,012 --> 00:28:31,343
They are bad people,

319
00:28:31,547 --> 00:28:33,105
don't make those friends!

320
00:28:33,316 --> 00:28:37,082
They smoke, don't listen to music!

321
00:28:39,755 --> 00:28:40,983
They don't listen to music so they're bad?

322
00:28:41,857 --> 00:28:43,017
Of course!

323
00:28:43,793 --> 00:28:45,124
Don't make it hard for me!

324
00:28:45,328 --> 00:28:46,920
What's so hard about that?

325
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,198
You're my only son,

326
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:54,994
I'm just worried about you.

327
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,466
Answer properly!

328
00:28:59,709 --> 00:29:00,539
Okay

329
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:04,143
And don't make those friends, understand?

330
00:29:08,484 --> 00:29:09,246
I'm done!

331
00:29:12,221 --> 00:29:13,188
Are you on a diet?

332
00:29:21,464 --> 00:29:24,865
Look at this,

333
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:25,965
misplacing the CD's.

334
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,865
Pay more attention!

335
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:37,137
Don't daydream all the time, be proper.

336
00:29:37,413 --> 00:29:39,608
Be someone ordinary!

337
00:29:49,925 --> 00:29:51,859
I've listened to music for decades.

338
00:29:54,163 --> 00:29:58,463
Young people shouldn't think so much.

339
00:30:03,105 --> 00:30:04,402
I didn't!

340
00:30:08,344 --> 00:30:09,641
How long haven't you listened to music?

341
00:30:11,847 --> 00:30:12,438
If I haven't,

342
00:30:12,648 --> 00:30:15,344
how would I misplace the CD?

343
00:30:58,994 --> 00:31:01,326
Music has many different forms.

344
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,395
We can use different instruments,

345
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:06,159
to mix and
have different types of feelings.

346
00:31:06,502 --> 00:31:09,403
Like just a while ago,
we had piano and flute.

347
00:31:10,005 --> 00:31:11,734
Let's have one of the music majors

348
00:31:11,941 --> 00:31:14,136
come up and do an example for us.

349
00:31:15,111 --> 00:31:17,375
Sky, how about you?

350
00:31:19,582 --> 00:31:22,312
Sky, did you hear what I said?

351
00:31:26,122 --> 00:31:27,054
How about you?

352
00:31:49,311 --> 00:31:50,903
Jay, want to shoot some hoops later?

353
00:31:51,147 --> 00:31:52,045
I'll pass!

354
00:31:58,554 --> 00:31:59,521
I'll return the book tomorrow!

355
00:31:59,722 --> 00:32:00,552
Okay!

356
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,688
Later! Bye!

357
00:32:01,891 --> 00:32:02,880
Sure, bye!

358
00:32:05,961 --> 00:32:06,689
Bye, Sky!

359
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,827
Can you give me a ride home?

360
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:12,566
Your bike, give me ride home?

361
00:32:17,473 --> 00:32:19,634
Never mind, I'm just kidding, bye!

362
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:21,405
Bye!

363
00:32:22,578 --> 00:32:24,637
Can you give me a ride home?

364
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,914
Sure, come on! You're such a copycat!

365
00:32:29,118 --> 00:32:29,948
You're so bad!

366
00:32:30,152 --> 00:32:30,880
What?

367
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,119
Someone missed class today!

368
00:32:33,456 --> 00:32:35,515
I was practicing in the piano room!

369
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:39,523
Sure? Then I'll take you some place.

370
00:32:40,029 --> 00:32:40,927
No class later?

371
00:32:41,931 --> 00:32:43,626
Jump aboard or I'll take Sky!

372
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,458
Okay, let's go!

373
00:32:57,313 --> 00:33:01,613
Quit messing,
you said it was only for 3 days!

374
00:33:02,151 --> 00:33:03,516
It's been 2 weeks,

375
00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:06,483
I'm gonna get hell from my boss!

376
00:33:07,223 --> 00:33:10,158
What? Alright, I'll have a look.

377
00:33:23,706 --> 00:33:24,934
This is my favorite song.

378
00:33:34,683 --> 00:33:40,178
Well? Do you like it?

379
00:34:08,617 --> 00:34:09,106
Keep the change!

380
00:34:09,318 --> 00:34:10,376
Thanks!

381
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:46,410
We're not going inside, hurry!

382
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:15,646
What's wrong?

383
00:35:23,892 --> 00:35:28,295
It's asthma, I just need a short break.

384
00:35:29,131 --> 00:35:30,029
Don't scare me now.

385
00:35:34,436 --> 00:35:38,532
So, I can't kiss a boy.

386
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,705
Can't hold hands,

387
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:45,376
can't do anything too exciting.

388
00:36:00,696 --> 00:36:01,560
Really?

389
00:36:04,033 --> 00:36:09,767
Just messing with you, I feel better.

390
00:36:16,045 --> 00:36:17,444
I'll tell you a secret.

391
00:36:20,749 --> 00:36:21,511
Okay.

392
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:28,884
I...

393
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:40,763
counted 108 steps
from class to the piano room.

394
00:36:41,036 --> 00:36:42,003
That's silly.

395
00:36:44,473 --> 00:36:45,804
Forget that I've said it then!

396
00:36:48,911 --> 00:36:49,900
Fine!

397
00:36:53,415 --> 00:36:54,609
I've counted too!

398
00:36:55,684 --> 00:36:59,279
It's 5 steps from here to you!

399
00:37:00,189 --> 00:37:01,247
How would you know?

400
00:37:04,526 --> 00:37:09,190
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

401
00:37:15,771 --> 00:37:17,136
You almost had me!

402
00:37:18,173 --> 00:37:19,333
Such a silly game!

403
00:37:32,654 --> 00:37:39,457
It's Swan, this is so hard to find!

404
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:45,088
You did the piano battle

405
00:37:46,235 --> 00:37:47,930
to get this for me?

406
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,066
Yeah.

407
00:37:57,646 --> 00:37:58,772
You don't have many friends, right?

408
00:38:00,783 --> 00:38:01,909
Nobody likes me.

409
00:38:03,118 --> 00:38:04,176
How can that be?

410
00:38:04,653 --> 00:38:05,620
Do you like me?

411
00:38:19,668 --> 00:38:20,760
I like you.

412
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,066
The world is a peaceful lullaby.

413
00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:56,965
But I insist on my manhood.

414
00:38:57,172 --> 00:38:59,606
Face all my enemies with an iron will.

415
00:38:59,808 --> 00:39:02,709
Love you tenderly under the moon.

416
00:39:02,911 --> 00:39:07,507
Men do not play sissy games.

417
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,780
Life is like calm scenery.

418
00:39:10,986 --> 00:39:13,511
I insist with the shade of my manhood,

419
00:39:13,722 --> 00:39:16,247
to give heat to my brothers,

420
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:19,484
and leave the chest for the girls' tears.

421
00:39:19,695 --> 00:39:20,889
I'm a total man!

422
00:39:21,096 --> 00:39:24,964
Watch out, girls!

423
00:39:25,234 --> 00:39:27,395
Adjusting my manly breath,

424
00:39:27,603 --> 00:39:30,265
shaking my manly hairstyle,

425
00:39:30,472 --> 00:39:32,997
open my manly eyes,

426
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:36,177
to give you a sweet face.

427
00:39:36,378 --> 00:39:40,314
I'll charm you with my manly smile!

428
00:39:41,984 --> 00:39:44,452
Men with biceps of a mountain,

429
00:39:44,653 --> 00:39:47,053
men with Ioneliness of wolves,

430
00:39:47,256 --> 00:39:49,884
men with heated passion,

431
00:39:50,092 --> 00:39:52,890
men with warm hearts,

432
00:39:53,095 --> 00:39:54,289
that man is me.

433
00:39:54,496 --> 00:39:55,827
Watch out girls!

434
00:39:56,031 --> 00:39:57,020
That man is me,

435
00:39:57,232 --> 00:40:01,635
and you've fallen for me!

436
00:40:20,389 --> 00:40:21,549
Do you know
they're tearing this place down?

437
00:40:23,759 --> 00:40:24,783
When?

438
00:40:25,193 --> 00:40:26,057
Graduation day!

439
00:40:30,499 --> 00:40:32,990
Then do you want to learn it?

440
00:40:33,201 --> 00:40:35,692
That song I played the first time
you met me?

441
00:40:36,939 --> 00:40:37,837
You're really going to teach me?

442
00:40:39,141 --> 00:40:40,233
Finally?

443
00:41:22,451 --> 00:41:23,577
Do you have to play so fast?

444
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:26,450
That's how fast I play before I go home.

445
00:41:26,822 --> 00:41:27,880
That's hard to remember.

446
00:41:31,226 --> 00:41:33,057
Don't play this in the old piano room.

447
00:41:34,763 --> 00:41:35,593
Why?

448
00:41:36,798 --> 00:41:38,663
It sounds bad on the old piano.

449
00:41:40,435 --> 00:41:40,867
I thought it's

450
00:41:41,069 --> 00:41:42,058
because Sky usually plays there.

451
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,328
So you don't want me there.

452
00:41:46,108 --> 00:41:47,097
I'll play you a song too!

453
00:41:47,709 --> 00:41:48,437
Now?

454
00:41:48,643 --> 00:41:49,610
Not now!

455
00:41:50,479 --> 00:41:53,471
On graduation day, I'll play for you!

456
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:57,418
Alright, it's a deal!

457
00:41:58,453 --> 00:41:59,442
Aren't we too old for this?

458
00:42:02,157 --> 00:42:03,351
123, Push!

459
00:42:03,558 --> 00:42:05,583
Push, push.

460
00:42:33,021 --> 00:42:36,718
That looks nice, a gift from you boyfriend?

461
00:42:38,026 --> 00:42:39,050
I don't have a boyfriend.

462
00:42:39,728 --> 00:42:41,025
Oh, you don't have a boyfriend.

463
00:42:58,313 --> 00:42:59,405
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

464
00:43:30,445 --> 00:43:32,003
Can you sign for me?

465
00:43:32,581 --> 00:43:33,240
Sure!

466
00:43:33,515 --> 00:43:36,279
- You guys are so good!
- We're just okay.

467
00:43:36,852 --> 00:43:38,547
Thank you!

468
00:43:38,753 --> 00:43:41,017
Next week is the championship,
want to come?

469
00:43:41,223 --> 00:43:42,247
Can we? Thank you

470
00:43:42,457 --> 00:43:43,014
Of course!

471
00:43:43,225 --> 00:43:45,159
You're so cool! Bye!

472
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,622
Bye!

473
00:43:48,663 --> 00:43:50,255
You're so cool!

474
00:43:56,304 --> 00:43:57,498
Hey, Jay!

475
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,102
Men don't play sissy games!

476
00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:02,867
Jay!

477
00:44:03,078 --> 00:44:05,012
Not bad!
Girls from our class ask you to sign!

478
00:44:05,213 --> 00:44:06,373
That's nothing!

479
00:44:06,581 --> 00:44:08,344
You have to get use to it
when you hang with us!

480
00:44:09,251 --> 00:44:10,081
Got a question!

481
00:44:10,352 --> 00:44:11,512
Shoot!

482
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,985
Have you athletes heard of asthma?

483
00:44:15,557 --> 00:44:16,285
What are you? Stupid?

484
00:44:16,491 --> 00:44:18,550
- That's so easy, bye now!
- Bye!

485
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,490
That's so easy, it's a sort of cold.

486
00:44:21,696 --> 00:44:23,823
Bull! You're not even close!

487
00:44:24,032 --> 00:44:25,966
It's a sport injury!

488
00:44:26,168 --> 00:44:26,827
Really?

489
00:44:27,035 --> 00:44:27,729
Yeah!

490
00:44:27,936 --> 00:44:29,062
I better ask someone else.

491
00:44:29,905 --> 00:44:33,204
A sport injury?

492
00:44:33,408 --> 00:44:34,204
Yeah!

493
00:45:03,371 --> 00:45:03,803
You're back!

494
00:45:04,005 --> 00:45:05,472
You play well when I'm not around.

495
00:45:07,075 --> 00:45:08,064
Just learned it!

496
00:45:08,777 --> 00:45:09,607
From who?

497
00:45:10,545 --> 00:45:11,534
None of your business.

498
00:45:16,818 --> 00:45:18,080
What's good for asthma?

499
00:45:18,853 --> 00:45:23,051
Dancing, dancing's good for asthma.

500
00:45:23,258 --> 00:45:25,522
Crap! What's really good for asthma?

501
00:45:25,961 --> 00:45:27,724
Food makes you crap,

502
00:45:27,963 --> 00:45:31,763
dancing doesn't. And...

503
00:45:32,634 --> 00:45:34,625
Dance with me, and I'll tell you!

504
00:45:34,836 --> 00:45:35,564
How about it?

505
00:46:16,278 --> 00:46:17,540
Dad, are you done?

506
00:46:17,846 --> 00:46:18,744
Just about!

507
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,217
What's good for asthma?

508
00:46:31,226 --> 00:46:34,218
AN APPLE A DAY KEEPS DOCTOR AWAY

509
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:40,858
By the way,
the market lady gave us some apple!

510
00:46:41,169 --> 00:46:42,227
So it's apples?

511
00:46:42,537 --> 00:46:42,866
Yeah

512
00:46:43,071 --> 00:46:43,560
Don't play with me!

513
00:46:43,772 --> 00:46:45,933
Apple!

514
00:46:47,876 --> 00:46:53,041
How do you turn this on?

515
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:17,337
York, what else do you want to listen to?

516
00:47:20,175 --> 00:47:22,473
It's class time,
I'll play for you next time!

517
00:47:33,755 --> 00:47:34,779
So many apples!

518
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:36,882
Want some?

519
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:38,218
Can I?

520
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,124
No! 15 apples for 15 days!

521
00:47:43,365 --> 00:47:44,696
Look at how long you haven't been to class.

522
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,631
What does that have to do with apples?

523
00:47:46,835 --> 00:47:48,826
I bought them for you!

524
00:47:49,438 --> 00:47:50,564
I'm like a fool everyday!

525
00:47:50,772 --> 00:47:54,230
I brought all these,
but you're not even here.

526
00:47:56,044 --> 00:47:57,409
Give them to Sky then!

527
00:47:57,913 --> 00:48:00,507
Sky? Sure,

528
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:02,781
I have so many of them anyways.

529
00:48:05,987 --> 00:48:07,545
What the? Are you mad?

530
00:48:08,223 --> 00:48:09,417
When I'm not in school,

531
00:48:11,126 --> 00:48:12,593
will you like other girls?

532
00:48:13,929 --> 00:48:14,987
Yeah, 15 other girls.

533
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:22,930
Hey, help me out!

534
00:48:31,713 --> 00:48:36,616
Bach and Vivaldi

535
00:48:37,953 --> 00:48:42,890
Classical, there's Mozart, Beethoven,

536
00:48:43,658 --> 00:48:45,558
over there we have the most famous one.

537
00:49:18,793 --> 00:49:21,557
Rain, Rain!

538
00:49:21,763 --> 00:49:22,320
What's wrong?

539
00:49:22,531 --> 00:49:23,429
I'm sorry!

540
00:49:25,033 --> 00:49:28,560
Rain ran, Rain ran away!

541
00:49:35,911 --> 00:49:36,639
Where?

542
00:49:37,479 --> 00:49:39,674
Rain ran away!

543
00:49:40,615 --> 00:49:41,479
Jay!

544
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:46,511
Rain's mad!

545
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:42,232
Thank you!

546
00:50:49,918 --> 00:50:51,044
Excuse me!

547
00:51:13,274 --> 00:51:14,332
Are you okay?

548
00:51:15,143 --> 00:51:15,973
Yeah.

549
00:51:17,412 --> 00:51:19,209
Don't you have anything to say to me?

550
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:29,147
I don't know what to say, I'm sorry.

551
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:04,818
Stop playing, you'll make me cry!

552
00:52:32,053 --> 00:52:34,681
Dad, can you cut it out?

553
00:52:37,058 --> 00:52:38,082
What?

554
00:52:39,627 --> 00:52:41,185
Cut it out!

555
00:52:50,338 --> 00:52:52,238
Cut it out, just leave me alone.

556
00:52:52,474 --> 00:52:53,498
What's wrong?

557
00:52:54,542 --> 00:52:56,203
Just tell Dad, okay?

558
00:52:58,947 --> 00:52:59,845
Nothing!

559
00:53:03,151 --> 00:53:09,852
You're my only son, I'm worried about you.

560
00:53:10,325 --> 00:53:12,850
Tell me what's on your mind.

561
00:53:14,763 --> 00:53:15,730
I'll go cook!

562
00:53:24,005 --> 00:53:25,905
Don't cook, it's a day off!

563
00:53:27,408 --> 00:53:30,673
Let's eat out, okay?

564
00:53:30,912 --> 00:53:31,901
What do you want?

565
00:53:43,825 --> 00:53:46,259
Let's go out and eat!

566
00:53:48,997 --> 00:53:52,728
Be happy!

567
00:54:14,823 --> 00:54:18,224
Alright, alright! Who're you looking for?

568
00:54:18,593 --> 00:54:19,617
I'm looking for Rain!

569
00:54:20,161 --> 00:54:21,685
Not so loud!

570
00:54:22,297 --> 00:54:26,393
She's resting, you'll disturb her.

571
00:54:27,168 --> 00:54:28,692
Why isn't she in class?

572
00:54:29,571 --> 00:54:31,801
She dropped out!

573
00:54:33,474 --> 00:54:38,707
Her asthma's acting up and needs rest.

574
00:54:39,314 --> 00:54:40,406
Then...

575
00:55:29,364 --> 00:55:30,331
Sky!

576
00:55:30,999 --> 00:55:33,058
I'm sorry about last time.

577
00:55:33,935 --> 00:55:35,698
It's okay, it's in the past.

578
00:56:12,106 --> 00:56:18,067
After five months...

579
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:23,612
Okay, so these 2 starts to cave in.

580
00:56:23,818 --> 00:56:25,080
They'll cave in from right here.

581
00:56:25,286 --> 00:56:26,310
Then the two will connect.

582
00:56:26,521 --> 00:56:28,785
Now think in 3 dimensions,

583
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:30,617
now there are 2 holes.

584
00:56:30,825 --> 00:56:32,690
This one here is the mouth.

585
00:56:33,161 --> 00:56:34,185
Did you ride your bike today?

586
00:56:34,696 --> 00:56:35,663
No.

587
00:56:38,032 --> 00:56:40,933
Will you give me a ride
if you had the bike?

588
00:56:42,236 --> 00:56:43,032
Sure.

589
00:56:43,771 --> 00:56:47,673
Abalone? Is that abalone?

590
00:56:47,875 --> 00:56:48,967
We don't have abalone.

591
00:56:49,844 --> 00:56:51,436
Why don't you just wait outside?

592
00:56:52,246 --> 00:56:53,304
I've waited so long,

593
00:56:54,515 --> 00:56:57,177
I'm hungry!

594
00:56:59,954 --> 00:57:00,818
The usual, right?

595
00:57:01,022 --> 00:57:02,148
- Yeah! - Ok!

596
00:57:02,657 --> 00:57:03,316
Ok, thanks!

597
00:57:03,524 --> 00:57:05,014
How have you been?

598
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:05,949
I've been okay!

599
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,058
- Sure? - Yeah

600
00:57:07,261 --> 00:57:08,489
- bye now! - Be careful!

601
00:57:08,696 --> 00:57:09,685
Okay, bye!

602
00:57:17,171 --> 00:57:19,105
Old pianos are hard to play.

603
00:57:21,142 --> 00:57:21,972
Really?

604
00:57:23,378 --> 00:57:25,346
You like to come here often.

605
00:57:28,216 --> 00:57:29,649
I have a lot of memories here.

606
00:57:31,452 --> 00:57:33,113
Too bad it'll be torn

607
00:57:33,454 --> 00:57:34,785
down on graduation day.

608
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:37,157
I know.

609
00:57:39,127 --> 00:57:40,116
You're kind of mysterious.

610
00:57:41,529 --> 00:57:42,587
Really?

611
00:57:44,098 --> 00:57:46,259
You can tell me what's on your mind.

612
00:57:48,569 --> 00:57:49,536
Okay.

613
00:57:53,341 --> 00:57:56,333
Can I get a ride home after school?

614
00:58:42,457 --> 00:58:44,448
Don't you have this album already?

615
00:58:44,759 --> 00:58:45,589
Yeah.

616
00:59:14,122 --> 00:59:18,388
Welcome to the 84th graduation ceremony

617
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:20,994
for TanJiang Art school.

618
00:59:22,296 --> 00:59:23,524
Throughout this year,

619
00:59:24,465 --> 00:59:26,194
watching outstanding graduates completing

620
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,698
this phase of their education.

621
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:30,737
Nervous?

622
00:59:31,606 --> 00:59:32,095
A little.

623
00:59:32,306 --> 00:59:34,604
It'll bring good luck!

624
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:37,504
I'll give this back after the concert.

625
00:59:38,212 --> 00:59:40,009
Okay, good luck!

626
00:59:52,627 --> 00:59:53,491
Come sit!

627
01:01:59,587 --> 01:02:03,045
Rain! Rain!

628
01:02:36,557 --> 01:02:37,956
And don't disappear anymore, okay?

629
01:02:38,693 --> 01:02:39,557
Okay!

630
01:02:58,879 --> 01:02:59,903
What're you doing?

631
01:03:00,548 --> 01:03:01,480
Wait for me in class!

632
01:03:03,984 --> 01:03:06,578
You're a disgrace! Get back there!

633
01:03:08,456 --> 01:03:09,423
Lunatic!

634
01:03:20,935 --> 01:03:21,833
It really brought good luck!

635
01:03:23,003 --> 01:03:23,526
What're you doing?

636
01:03:23,738 --> 01:03:25,569
- Where did you go?
- It's over, now you come back?

637
01:03:51,232 --> 01:03:53,894
What's with this class, a refugee camp?

638
01:03:54,101 --> 01:03:54,590
There's nothing here?

639
01:03:54,802 --> 01:03:57,737
They should get a grant,
only pens are rulers!

640
01:03:58,139 --> 01:03:59,470
Look at that!

641
01:04:00,141 --> 01:04:00,505
What?

642
01:04:00,708 --> 01:04:01,640
That!

643
01:04:02,009 --> 01:04:06,173
Hello, Jay!

644
01:04:08,382 --> 01:04:09,110
What're you doing?

645
01:04:09,483 --> 01:04:11,542
Cleaning your classroom!

646
01:04:11,752 --> 01:04:12,309
- A lot of good stuff!
- Don't say...

647
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:13,851
we didn't take care of you!

648
01:04:14,054 --> 01:04:17,023
Here, this is for you, don't forget us!

649
01:04:17,691 --> 01:04:18,419
Let's go!

650
01:04:18,726 --> 01:04:19,784
To the next room!

651
01:04:20,861 --> 01:04:22,226
Did you see a girl in my class?

652
01:04:24,832 --> 01:04:25,799
Girl?

653
01:04:26,066 --> 01:04:26,760
Who?

654
01:04:27,568 --> 01:04:29,297
The one dancing with me at the party!

655
01:04:30,171 --> 01:04:30,933
Dancing?

656
01:04:31,439 --> 01:04:32,633
Are you nuts?

657
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,569
You were dancing alone!

658
01:04:35,376 --> 01:04:37,606
You totally stole my thunder!

659
01:04:41,382 --> 01:04:42,371
Why aren't you in class today?

660
01:04:42,817 --> 01:04:43,909
I was practicing!

661
01:04:44,452 --> 01:04:46,147
Someone missed class today!

662
01:04:46,487 --> 01:04:48,284
I was practicing in the piano room!

663
01:04:48,589 --> 01:04:50,022
No! 15 apples for 15 days!

664
01:04:50,491 --> 01:04:51,890
Look at how long you haven't been to class.

665
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:54,989
The one dancing with me at the party!

666
01:04:57,398 --> 01:04:59,195
You were dancing alone!

667
01:05:06,774 --> 01:05:08,742
Next time you need a dance partner,
just ask me.

668
01:05:13,013 --> 01:05:13,809
What's your name?

669
01:05:15,483 --> 01:05:16,882
I told you already.

670
01:05:17,084 --> 01:05:18,745
I heard 4 hands playing,

671
01:05:19,353 --> 01:05:20,445
but you're alone?

672
01:05:24,325 --> 01:05:26,122
You students! Unbelievable!

673
01:05:26,927 --> 01:05:27,916
I'll pretend I didn't see anything.

674
01:05:38,772 --> 01:05:41,172
Being able to meet you has been incredible.

675
01:06:24,552 --> 01:06:26,918
(I'm Rain!)

676
01:06:39,934 --> 01:06:42,494
(Where are you?)

677
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,353
(I love you!)

678
01:07:23,477 --> 01:07:32,146
(Do you love me?)

679
01:07:53,307 --> 01:07:54,331
Granny!

680
01:07:55,776 --> 01:07:56,743
Granny!

681
01:07:58,278 --> 01:07:59,176
Granny!

682
01:07:59,647 --> 01:08:00,636
Anyone there?

683
01:08:01,015 --> 01:08:01,845
Who're you looking for?

684
01:08:03,917 --> 01:08:05,043
I'm looking for Rain, is she home?

685
01:08:07,688 --> 01:08:09,952
The door's not locked, come in.

686
01:08:27,541 --> 01:08:30,999
Try to be quiet,
Rain is listening to music.

687
01:09:30,437 --> 01:09:33,463
Where did she go?

688
01:09:41,415 --> 01:09:43,576
This is her favorite song.

689
01:09:48,155 --> 01:09:52,114
One day, she told me:

690
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:56,661
She met a boy who loves this song too!

691
01:10:19,586 --> 01:10:20,883
Don't touch Rain's stuff!

692
01:10:41,041 --> 01:10:45,910
Rain, Mom should've believed you!

693
01:10:47,147 --> 01:10:48,045
What?

694
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:22,371
It was 1979,

695
01:11:23,717 --> 01:11:27,016
Rain is a 3rd year student.

696
01:11:28,055 --> 01:11:31,786
She plays the piano very well, and...

697
01:11:32,359 --> 01:11:35,089
she is a very talented student.

698
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:40,293
But, she was always daydreaming...

699
01:11:48,442 --> 01:11:49,409
Rain.

700
01:11:51,812 --> 01:11:53,302
We've sat here for so long already,

701
01:11:54,781 --> 01:11:57,875
can you tell me now why are you crying?

702
01:11:58,752 --> 01:11:59,980
I'm getting kind of tired.

703
01:12:03,924 --> 01:12:07,655
Will you believe me?

704
01:12:08,929 --> 01:12:11,056
Of course I will.

705
01:12:11,965 --> 01:12:14,160
I'm just afraid you don't trust me.

706
01:12:18,972 --> 01:12:21,566
Then I'll tell you a story, okay?

707
01:12:26,613 --> 01:12:27,671
One day...

708
01:12:49,603 --> 01:12:50,865
Secret...

709
01:12:59,479 --> 01:13:01,845
Follow the notes upon ajourney,

710
01:13:02,249 --> 01:13:05,241
At first sight marks one's destiny.

711
01:13:05,752 --> 01:13:08,152
Once the voyage comes to an end,

712
01:13:08,722 --> 01:13:13,716
Return lies within hasty keys.

713
01:15:06,973 --> 01:15:10,067
Because I want to see him at first sight,

714
01:15:11,578 --> 01:15:12,476
Excuse me.

715
01:15:12,679 --> 01:15:14,772
So only he can see me.

716
01:15:16,716 --> 01:15:18,183
Excuse me, I'm wondering...

717
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:20,984
Excuse me!

718
01:15:21,221 --> 01:15:22,586
Excuse me, I'm wondering...

719
01:15:36,636 --> 01:15:37,694
Now we will be learning

720
01:15:37,904 --> 01:15:39,963
a new formula.

721
01:15:40,874 --> 01:15:43,138
Basically at the circumference,

722
01:15:43,577 --> 01:15:46,671
and any value outside of it,

723
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:48,642
there're 2 values for M,

724
01:15:48,849 --> 01:15:50,908
if you can only find 1,

725
01:15:51,351 --> 01:15:52,545
that means...

726
01:16:14,908 --> 01:16:16,637
Sorry I'm late.

727
01:16:18,712 --> 01:16:21,442
Why was he a musical genius?

728
01:16:24,317 --> 01:16:26,308
We were in the same class,

729
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:29,284
Hey, pay attention in class!

730
01:16:29,489 --> 01:16:30,717
January 18th, 1999

731
01:16:30,924 --> 01:16:33,722
just that we're 20 years apart.

732
01:16:43,236 --> 01:16:44,100
Stop!

733
01:16:47,607 --> 01:16:52,442
97, 98, 99, 100, 101

734
01:16:52,646 --> 01:16:57,709
102, 103, 104, 105

735
01:16:57,884 --> 01:16:59,545
Because I want to see him at first sight,

736
01:17:00,153 --> 01:17:03,088
I counted the distance
from piano room to class,

737
01:17:03,924 --> 01:17:06,051
It's 108 steps.

738
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:09,727
B is augmented by 6 keys.

739
01:17:10,397 --> 01:17:14,993
We are asked to find E...

740
01:17:15,969 --> 01:17:18,335
But it was successful all the time.

741
01:17:28,949 --> 01:17:32,908
I'll never forget how his back looks.

742
01:17:33,987 --> 01:17:37,787
Those moments were hard to get!

743
01:17:52,539 --> 01:17:57,442
York thought Rain was going back.

744
01:17:58,144 --> 01:18:00,476
No, I'm here to see Jay.

745
01:18:01,948 --> 01:18:04,815
I've made you fail.

746
01:18:20,367 --> 01:18:22,699
Sky is here.

747
01:18:51,064 --> 01:18:54,659
Rain! Rain!

748
01:18:56,670 --> 01:19:01,073
Rain's gone! She's going home!

749
01:19:32,505 --> 01:19:35,099
It could be...

750
01:19:36,876 --> 01:19:41,176
He has no taste, that's right!

751
01:19:42,949 --> 01:19:45,213
That's how future boys are!

752
01:19:45,418 --> 01:19:46,578
If I see him,

753
01:19:46,786 --> 01:19:48,185
I'll slap him silly!

754
01:19:48,822 --> 01:19:50,813
Naughty! Naughty!

755
01:19:51,725 --> 01:19:52,316
York!

756
01:19:52,525 --> 01:19:53,253
Yes!

757
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:56,327
That's too obvious,
it's no longer eavesdropping!

758
01:19:56,796 --> 01:19:58,127
Yes sir! I'll go sweep there!

759
01:20:00,867 --> 01:20:02,459
Be careful, he's a pervert!

760
01:20:07,707 --> 01:20:08,901
Rain...

761
01:20:10,677 --> 01:20:13,305
He's just not worth it,

762
01:20:13,847 --> 01:20:14,905
forget about him.

763
01:20:15,548 --> 01:20:18,142
If anything bothers you,

764
01:20:18,351 --> 01:20:21,286
you can talk to me, okay?

765
01:20:36,603 --> 01:20:42,235
I won't go see him anymore.

766
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:49,048
Can you keep this for me?

767
01:20:54,854 --> 01:21:00,815
And one more thing,

768
01:21:02,228 --> 01:21:07,530
don't mention this to anyone else.

769
01:21:12,071 --> 01:21:15,131
Then can you keep this secret?

770
01:21:15,742 --> 01:21:16,731
Of course!

771
01:21:24,617 --> 01:21:29,577
Rain! Don't think so much!

772
01:21:40,533 --> 01:21:44,833
We've been concerned about Rain.

773
01:21:45,405 --> 01:21:47,396
So don't you worry,

774
01:21:48,074 --> 01:21:51,874
Students, teachers,

775
01:21:52,078 --> 01:21:55,241
The school really cares for her.

776
01:21:57,484 --> 01:22:02,114
Mostly, we need parents to help us out.

777
01:22:07,961 --> 01:22:08,757
You're the head of the class.

778
01:22:09,729 --> 01:22:12,562
You should watch over her, understand?

779
01:22:17,203 --> 01:22:21,264
Don't tell other students about this!

780
01:22:39,492 --> 01:22:42,859
(Lose your virginity
20 years in the future?)

781
01:23:02,248 --> 01:23:03,977
What's the point of being
such a good student?

782
01:23:04,217 --> 01:23:07,618
It's a shame she's messed up!

783
01:23:07,921 --> 01:23:10,355
That's beauty that's wasted!

784
01:23:10,623 --> 01:23:14,286
Let's talk about
what the graduation performance.

785
01:23:14,594 --> 01:23:16,323
We can just ask Rain to do it!

786
01:23:16,663 --> 01:23:19,962
Do what?
Travel through time to look for love?

787
01:23:21,067 --> 01:23:22,762
Alright, stop messing with her!

788
01:23:32,011 --> 01:23:33,410
What? Can't take ajoke?

789
01:23:37,317 --> 01:23:38,341
Don't pick on her!

790
01:23:39,018 --> 01:23:40,542
Go do your garbage!

791
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:44,657
Rain?

792
01:24:08,381 --> 01:24:11,077
Rain, you're really not going to class?

793
01:24:24,297 --> 01:24:28,358
Take some medication then,
I'll leave them here.

794
01:24:51,391 --> 01:24:55,555
(Psychiatrist Dr. Chang)

795
01:25:55,621 --> 01:25:56,679
Who is he?

796
01:25:58,658 --> 01:26:00,683
He's the boy I told you about!

797
01:26:05,064 --> 01:26:07,430
How does Mom look in 20 years?

798
01:26:12,972 --> 01:26:17,272
The locks were changed, I couldn't get in.

799
01:26:18,845 --> 01:26:24,181
But Mom is probably as beautiful.

800
01:26:36,863 --> 01:26:37,852
It's all your fault!

801
01:26:38,731 --> 01:26:42,462
Saying that music
will make her more elegant!

802
01:26:43,703 --> 01:26:47,571
Look at how sick she is!

803
01:26:49,909 --> 01:26:54,471
What will we do?

804
01:27:01,487 --> 01:27:03,387
(Psychiatrist Dr. Chang)

805
01:27:12,565 --> 01:27:13,964
Rain, I'll get you some water.

806
01:27:24,844 --> 01:27:26,471
Did she mention that boy?

807
01:27:26,712 --> 01:27:29,840
Yes, thank you for visiting her.

808
01:27:30,316 --> 01:27:32,648
She'll be really happy to see you.

809
01:27:33,286 --> 01:27:34,913
It's the graduation ceremony today,

810
01:27:35,121 --> 01:27:36,486
I hope she can be there.

811
01:27:37,290 --> 01:27:38,086
I'll get her.

812
01:27:50,002 --> 01:27:52,334
Rain, look who's here?

813
01:27:53,206 --> 01:27:55,970
Rain, it's graduation day.

814
01:27:56,342 --> 01:27:59,334
I wish you can come, okay?

815
01:28:01,047 --> 01:28:02,105
Do you know
they're tearing this place down?

816
01:28:03,082 --> 01:28:04,049
When?

817
01:28:04,584 --> 01:28:05,482
Graduation day!

818
01:28:05,952 --> 01:28:07,214
I'll play for you!

819
01:28:15,561 --> 01:28:17,392
Look who's back!

820
01:28:23,769 --> 01:28:25,134
Take a picture for me and Rain.

821
01:28:25,771 --> 01:28:29,571
Look here, 1, 2,3, cheese!

822
01:28:30,042 --> 01:28:31,600
But things didn't turn out

823
01:28:34,013 --> 01:28:35,412
like I expected.

824
01:28:36,082 --> 01:28:39,449
Me too!

825
01:28:40,653 --> 01:28:42,245
Look here, 1, 2,3, cheese!

826
01:29:43,215 --> 01:29:44,204
What're you doing?

827
01:29:46,385 --> 01:29:47,317
Wait for me in class!

828
01:29:53,526 --> 01:29:54,254
Gift from your boyfriend?

829
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:55,552
I don't have a boyfriend.

830
01:32:38,791 --> 01:32:40,588
That was our last picture together.

831
01:32:42,795 --> 01:32:47,892
Why do you ask? Have you heard of her?

832
01:32:53,539 --> 01:32:54,699
Oh and...

833
01:33:20,699 --> 01:33:21,825
Jay?

834
01:33:25,104 --> 01:33:26,571
Don't play this in the old piano room.

835
01:33:27,606 --> 01:33:28,504
Why?

836
01:33:28,908 --> 01:33:30,432
It sounds bad on the old piano.

837
01:33:55,034 --> 01:33:56,126
Ready over there?

838
01:33:57,603 --> 01:33:59,230
Yeah!

839
01:33:59,505 --> 01:34:02,133
Hurry up! Boss is rushing!

840
01:34:02,341 --> 01:34:03,899
No one left?

841
01:34:09,982 --> 01:34:10,744
Sure?

842
01:34:10,950 --> 01:34:13,441
I've checked a million times!

843
01:34:15,287 --> 01:34:16,948
What about the piano?

844
01:34:17,323 --> 01:34:19,348
The principal said they'll get new ones!

845
01:34:44,516 --> 01:34:45,949
Start here!

846
01:34:46,151 --> 01:34:47,948
Come over here!

847
01:35:37,136 --> 01:35:38,125
Do you have to play so fast?

848
01:35:39,271 --> 01:35:40,738
That's how fast I play before I go home.

849
01:35:41,373 --> 01:35:44,467
(Return lies within hasty keys.)

850
01:36:10,769 --> 01:36:11,599
(Even if we'll never see each other gain,)

851
01:36:11,804 --> 01:36:12,771
(even if you forget me,)

852
01:36:12,971 --> 01:36:14,029
