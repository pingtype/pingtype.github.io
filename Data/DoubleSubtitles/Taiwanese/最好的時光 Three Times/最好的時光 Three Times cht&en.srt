老闆娘 Ma'am...

10
00:08:26,975 --> 00:08:27,737
秀美喔 You're here!

11
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,170
新營來的秀美？ You came from Xinying?

12
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:30,310
來， 裏面坐 Go on in

13
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:31,941
我金紙燒完就進去 I'll be right there when I've made this offering

14
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,169
好啊 Okay

15
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:34,547
要幫忙嗎？ Need a hand?

16
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,776
不用！不用！ No, thanks

17
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:26,765
你有看嗎？ Did you look around?

18
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:29,702
看一看我帶你去樓上 I'll show you the upstairs

19
00:09:29,871 --> 00:09:30,565
好 Good

20
00:11:58,787 --> 00:11:59,515
秀美 May

21
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:00,520
等一會上來吃午餐 Come upstairs for lunch!

22
00:12:00,822 --> 00:12:01,550
好 Coming...

23
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:12,291
春子小姐 "Dear Miss Haruko..."

24
00:12:13,168 --> 00:12:14,999
很冒昧寫這封信給你 "I'm being bold enough to write to you"

25
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:17,438
我要去當兵了 "I'm about to do my military service"

26
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:19,736
昨天收到家裏寄來的信 "My folks wrote to me yesterday"

27
00:12:19,975 --> 00:12:21,966
說我的兵役通知單來了 "They said my call-up notice has arrived"

28
00:12:22,177 --> 00:12:23,644
要我儘快回家 "They're asking me to come home as soon as I can"

29
00:12:25,113 --> 00:12:26,239
時光飛逝 "Time flies..."

30
00:12:26,715 --> 00:12:29,013
想想自己這兩年大學沒考上 "I failed the university entrance exam two years running"

31
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:30,710
母親去世 "My mother has passed away"

32
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:33,546
未來的日子茫茫不可知 "I've no idea what the future holds"

33
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:36,916
跟你說這些，是想謝謝你 "I just want to thank you"

34
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,121
這段在旗後的日子 "The days I've spent around here..."

35
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:42,426
是我最快樂的時光 "...have been my happiest days"

36
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:45,890
衷心盼望能收到你的迴音 "Hope to hear back from you"

37
00:12:47,335 --> 00:12:49,530
敬祝安康 "Take care"

38
00:12:51,373 --> 00:12:53,864
P.S.，有一首 "P S. You know that song called 'In Love'?"

39
00:12:53,975 --> 00:12:55,636
歌詞是這樣的 "The lyrics go..."

40
00:12:59,814 --> 00:13:09,280
思戀你，思戀你呀 "I think of you, I think of you"

41
00:13:09,824 --> 00:13:18,357
你我離別三年啦 "It's been three years..."

42
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:26,497
昨晚的夢原來也是你的夢 "But you're always in my dreams"

43
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:41,317
港邊的海鳥爲何打醒我眠夢 "Why do seabirds wake me from my dream?"

44
00:13:42,223 --> 00:13:49,220
啼哭聲音悲哀 "It's because their sad cries..."

45
00:13:50,065 --> 00:13:59,906
會令人心內憂悶 "...pierce my heart"

46
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:05,405
春子在嗎？ Is Haruko here?

47
00:15:07,842 --> 00:15:09,605
她去臺中了 She's gone to Taichung

48
00:15:10,545 --> 00:15:11,637
臺中 Taichung?

49
00:15:14,349 --> 00:15:15,509
臺中哪裏？ Do you know where?

50
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:17,176
車站那裏 By the railway station

51
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:27,913
你叫什麼名字？ What's your name?

52
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:29,879
你的名字？ Your name?

53
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:32,259
我叫秀美 My name is May

54
00:16:32,994 --> 00:16:34,086
秀美 May

55
00:16:50,044 --> 00:16:50,874
有進嗎？ You sank it?

56
00:17:15,003 --> 00:17:16,334
漂亮！ Great!

57
00:18:03,051 --> 00:18:04,382
認真一點好不好 You need to concentrate!

58
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:06,111
我想打這邊碰那邊 I thought I could get this ball over there...

59
00:18:06,221 --> 00:18:07,017
看會不會滑進去 ...and sink it that way

60
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:08,521
那也差太多了 No way!

61
00:18:41,422 --> 00:18:42,889
你很久沒進了 You haven't sunk a ball for ages!

62
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:30,594
我還是輸啊 So I still lose

63
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:31,599
對啊 Right

64
00:19:32,974 --> 00:19:33,906
算了 Never mind

65
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:39,610
我要走了 I have to go

66
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:45,019
要去哪 Go where?

67
00:19:48,423 --> 00:19:50,516
等一下要去臺北當兵 I'm starting military service, in Taipei

68
00:20:10,044 --> 00:20:11,102
不用找了 Keep the change

69
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:01,485
寫信給你 I'll write to you

70
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,219
寫信給你 I'll write to you

71
00:21:06,601 --> 00:21:07,761
我寄到這裏 I'll send it here

72
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:45,781
秀美小姐 "Dear Miss May

73
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:46,925
還記得我嗎？ Do you remember me?"

74
00:23:47,562 --> 00:23:49,359
入伍前跟你撞球的那個人 "We played one round before I left to do military service"

75
00:23:50,331 --> 00:23:51,696
時間過得飛快 "Time flies"

76
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:53,295
轉眼已經三個月了 "That was three months ago!"

77
00:23:54,535 --> 00:23:55,695
春雨綿綿 "We have non-stop spring rain"

78
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,903
此刻，營區正放着披、頭四的歌 "In our base, they keep playing that song"

79
00:23:59,173 --> 00:24:00,697
"Rain and Tears"

80
00:24:01,342 --> 00:24:02,809
就像我的心情 "It sums up my feelings...

81
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,737
期待能再見到你 Hope to see you soon"

82
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,241
祝福，永遠美麗 "Stay beautiful!"

83
00:25:25,326 --> 00:25:26,520
先坐一坐 Have a seat

84
00:25:51,285 --> 00:25:52,343

86

你不吃飽再走？ Won't you have lunch with us first?

87
00:25:57,391 --> 00:25:59,825
不用，我要趕車 I'll miss the train

88
00:26:00,327 --> 00:26:01,817
你住不慣再回來喔！ You're welcome to come back here anytime

阿婆要三百，談不成 But Madame asks for 300, so they couldn't agree

198
00:55:47,546 --> 00:55:49,980
不足之數，我可以負擔 I will make up the difference for them

199

你多次在報紙撰文，反對儲妾 In your articles you have always criticize the keeping of concubines

200
00:56:02,294 --> 00:56:04,854
如今可好違背 Aren't you acting against your own principles?

201

我反對儲妾 I do disapprove of keeping concubines...

202
00:56:15,407 --> 00:56:17,307
然木已成舟 ...but in this case, I must assent

00:56:17,376 --> 00:56:20,504
爲妹妹終身有托只能成全 Ah Mei's future must come first

204
00:57:43,429 --> 00:57:45,226
承蒙張老爺照顧 Mr. Chang, your generosity is overwhelming

樑先生說三十年內 Mr Liang says China will not be ready...

220
01:04:09,047 --> 01:04:11,675
中國絕無能力援救 ...to help our people secede from Japan...

221
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:14,651
吾民脫離日人統治 ...for another 3 decades.

01:44:51,195 --> 01:44:53,095
之後我就睡了 I went to sleep right away

305
01:44:53,564 --> 01:44:56,362
可是你可以打電話給我 You could still have called me

306
01:44:57,835 --> 01:45:00,531
而且我打給你你沒有聽到嗎？ Couldn't you hear your phone?

307
01:45:04,609 --> 01:45:05,871
你都沒有聽到嗎？ Couldn't you?

308
01:45:06,744 --> 01:45:07,972
我開震動 I left it in vibration mode

309
01:45:19,824 --> 01:45:21,758
不要生氣了好不好？ Don't be angry

310

不要生氣了好不好？ Don't be angry

可是如果今天是你會怎想？ If you were me, what would you think?

312
01:45:45,249 --> 01:45:46,773
我等你收工回家好不好？ I'll wait for you when you finish, okay?

313
01:48:08,426 --> 01:48:10,986
收到文字訊息 TEXT MESSAGE

314
01:48:11,095 --> 01:48:15,725

315
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:21,830
“照片洗好了，明天交給你” "Developed the photos, will show you tomorrow"

316
01:48:42,693 --> 01:48:45,662
每次用這打火機點蠟燭，都燙到手 I burn my hand every time I light a candle with this lighter.

317
01:48:45,729 --> 01:48:47,162
大拇指好痛 My thumb hurts.

318
01:48:51,769 --> 01:48:53,634
如果再燒應該不能用了 It's almost run out.

319
01:48:53,704 --> 01:48:55,069
根本沒辦法點 I can hardly light this one.

320
01:48:56,907 --> 01:48:58,033
幫我拿一下那個 Pass that one to me.

321
01:49:00,444 --> 01:49:01,411

01:49:21,632 --> 01:49:23,600
這些幹麻，泡到水是不是 Has water gone inside?

326
01:49:24,134 --> 01:49:25,795
你聽到啪差啪差的聲音嗎 You hear that funny sound?

327

水跑進去了 The wick is wet.

這水都髒了 The water is dirty.

331
01:49:39,517 --> 01:49:41,485
等一下你去換一下 Can you change it later?

332
01:49:43,687 --> 01:49:45,484
是因爲那個蠟油嗎？ Is it because of the candle wax?

333
01:49:46,957 --> 01:49:48,254
根本點不着 I can't even light them

334
01:49:56,734 --> 01:50:00,966
泡澡用伊蘭跟鼠尾草好嗎？ Shall I put some fragrant oils in the bath?

335
01:50:02,773 --> 01:50:03,637
好 Okay

你不回答我就當你答應我 I'll take silence as a 'Yes'

338

也許停止，如此殘酷的聲音 "May rest, such cruel sound

343
01:50:59,096 --> 01:51:01,087
靖，好啦！快點 Jing! It's ready, hurry up!

344
01:51:04,234 --> 01:51:13,541
仍栩栩如生，好像一隻鳥一樣 "It's still vivid, like a bird"

345
