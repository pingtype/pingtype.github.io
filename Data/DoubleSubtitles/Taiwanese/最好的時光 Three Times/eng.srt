Ma'am...

9
00:08:26,975 --> 00:08:27,737
You're here!

10
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,170
You came from Xinying?

11
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:30,310
Go on in

12
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:31,941
I'll be right there when I've made this offering

13
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,169
Okay

14
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:34,547
Need a hand?

15
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,776
No, thanks

16
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:26,765
Did you look around?

17
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:29,702
I'll show you the upstairs

18
00:09:29,871 --> 00:09:30,565
Good

19
00:11:58,787 --> 00:11:59,515
May

20
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:00,520
Come upstairs for lunch!

21
00:12:00,822 --> 00:12:01,550
Coming...

22
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:12,291
"Dear Miss Haruko..."

23
00:12:13,168 --> 00:12:14,999
"I'm being bold enough to write to you"

24
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:17,438
"I'm about to do my military service"

25
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:19,736
"My folks wrote to me yesterday"

26
00:12:19,975 --> 00:12:21,966
"They said my call-up notice has arrived"

27
00:12:22,177 --> 00:12:23,644
"They're asking me to come home as soon as I can"

28
00:12:25,113 --> 00:12:26,239
"Time flies..."

29
00:12:26,715 --> 00:12:29,013
"I failed the university entrance exam two years running"

30
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:30,710
"My mother has passed away"

31
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:33,546
"I've no idea what the future holds"

32
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:36,916
"I just want to thank you"

33
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,121
"The days I've spent around here..."

34
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:42,426
"...have been my happiest days"

35
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:45,890
"Hope to hear back from you"

36
00:12:47,335 --> 00:12:49,530
"Take care"

37
00:12:51,373 --> 00:12:53,864
"P S. You know that song called 'In Love'?"

38
00:12:53,975 --> 00:12:55,636
"The lyrics go..."

39
00:12:59,814 --> 00:13:09,280
"I think of you, I think of you"

40
00:13:09,824 --> 00:13:18,357
"It's been three years..."

41
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:26,497
"But you're always in my dreams"

42
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:41,317
"Why do seabirds wake me from my dream?"

43
00:13:42,223 --> 00:13:49,220
"It's because their sad cries..."

44
00:13:50,065 --> 00:13:59,906
"...pierce my heart"

45
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:05,405
Is Haruko here?

46
00:15:07,842 --> 00:15:09,605
She's gone to Taichung

47
00:15:10,545 --> 00:15:11,637
Taichung?

48
00:15:14,349 --> 00:15:15,509
Do you know where?

49
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:17,176
By the railway station

50
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:27,913
What's your name?

51
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:29,879
Your name?

52
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:32,259
My name is May

53
00:16:32,994 --> 00:16:34,086
May

54
00:16:50,044 --> 00:16:50,874
You sank it?

55
00:17:15,003 --> 00:17:16,334
Great!

56
00:18:03,051 --> 00:18:04,382
You need to concentrate!

57
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:06,111
I thought I could get this ball over there...

58
00:18:06,221 --> 00:18:07,017
...and sink it that way

59
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:08,521
No way!

60
00:18:41,422 --> 00:18:42,889
You haven't sunk a ball for ages!

61
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:30,594
So I still lose

62
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:31,599
Right

63
00:19:32,974 --> 00:19:33,906
Never mind

64
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:39,610
I have to go

65
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:45,019
Go where?

66
00:19:48,423 --> 00:19:50,516
I'm starting military service, in Taipei

67
00:20:10,044 --> 00:20:11,102
Keep the change

68
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:01,485
I'll write to you

69
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,219
I'll write to you

70
00:21:06,601 --> 00:21:07,761
I'll send it here

71
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:45,781
"Dear Miss May

72
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:46,925
Do you remember me?"

73
00:23:47,562 --> 00:23:49,359
"We played one round before I left to do military service"

74
00:23:50,331 --> 00:23:51,696
"Time flies"

75
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:53,295
"That was three months ago!"

76
00:23:54,535 --> 00:23:55,695
"We have non-stop spring rain"

77
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,903
"In our base, they keep playing that song"

78
00:23:59,173 --> 00:24:00,697
"Rain and Tears"

79
00:24:01,342 --> 00:24:02,809
"It sums up my feelings...

80
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,737
Hope to see you soon"

81
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,241
"Stay beautiful!"

82
00:25:25,326 --> 00:25:26,520
Have a seat

83
00:25:51,285 --> 00:25:52,343
Ma'am...

84
00:25:53,788 --> 00:25:54,777
I should be going

85
00:25:55,122 --> 00:25:56,487
Won't you have lunch with us first?

86
00:25:57,391 --> 00:25:59,825
I'll miss the train

87
00:26:00,327 --> 00:26:01,817
You're welcome to come back here anytime

88
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,419
Thank you

89
00:26:37,331 --> 00:26:40,528
Have you worked in Jiayi before?

90
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:42,194
Yes

91
00:26:42,403 --> 00:26:43,836
I thought so, I saw you there

92
00:26:44,905 --> 00:26:46,236
I have to go

93
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:38,792
Hello

94
00:27:40,194 --> 00:27:41,491
Is May here?

95
00:27:41,796 --> 00:27:43,423
She doesn't work here any more

96
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:46,296
She's gone to Jiayi

97
00:27:47,802 --> 00:27:48,860
Jiayi?

98
00:27:52,473 --> 00:27:53,565
Where exactly?

99
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,568
A pool-hall there

100
00:28:00,848 --> 00:28:02,179
Are you looking for her?

101
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,342
I can ask our boss

102
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:10,215
Ma'am!

103
00:28:17,097 --> 00:28:18,564
There's a man here looking for May

104
00:28:18,632 --> 00:28:19,929
Okay

105
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:36,104
You're looking for May?

106
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:37,281
Yes

107
00:28:37,685 --> 00:28:40,210
She's in Jiayi, at 685, Zhongcheng Road

108
00:28:43,157 --> 00:28:43,851
Zhongcheng Road?

109
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:45,318
That's right

110
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:50,079
GANGSHAN

111
00:29:50,724 --> 00:29:52,885
TAINAN

112
00:29:55,496 --> 00:29:58,192
JIAYI

113
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:25,689
Excuse me...

114
00:30:26,193 --> 00:30:27,660
Is there a girl called May here?

115
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:31,624
She left days ago

116
00:30:32,633 --> 00:30:34,965
Do you know where she is now?

117
00:30:35,436 --> 00:30:36,903
Sorry, I don't

118
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,097
Thanks anyway

119
00:30:44,378 --> 00:30:45,538
One bonus point

120
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:56,456
SHUISHANG

121
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,461
XINYING

122
00:32:15,202 --> 00:32:16,533
Excuse me...

123
00:32:16,737 --> 00:32:18,830
This is Number 11, so where's Number 3?

124
00:32:19,506 --> 00:32:20,370
Number 30

125
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:21,872
Number 3

126
00:32:32,386 --> 00:32:36,550
That's No. 6... The doctor lives in No. 1

127
00:32:37,491 --> 00:32:39,857
You can ask there

128
00:33:06,353 --> 00:33:07,650
Anyone in?

129
00:33:09,523 --> 00:33:10,547
Who is it?

130
00:33:17,264 --> 00:33:18,288
Who are you looking for?

131
00:33:18,732 --> 00:33:19,926
I'm looking for May

132
00:33:21,068 --> 00:33:22,126
May?

133
00:33:22,703 --> 00:33:25,137
She's not here, she's in Huwei

134
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:27,767
Huwei

135
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:30,899
Who are you?

136
00:33:31,111 --> 00:33:32,100
How do you know this address?

137
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:34,111
I'm a friend of hers from Kaohsiung

138
00:33:34,748 --> 00:33:36,181
She wrote to me

139
00:33:40,888 --> 00:33:41,820
Oh, I see

140
00:33:42,055 --> 00:33:43,682
You know where she is?

141
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:46,386
Yes, she wrote to me the other day

142
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,888
I'll fetch her letter

143
00:33:47,995 --> 00:33:48,962
Thank you

144
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,007
Thank you

145
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:08,139
See you again!

146
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:17,182
DALIN

HUWEl

149
00:34:55,529 --> 00:34:57,292
You don't have to let me win!

150
00:36:01,595 --> 00:36:02,721
Long time no see!

151
00:36:22,983 --> 00:36:25,315
How did you find me here?

152
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,347
Your mother told me

153
00:36:30,924 --> 00:36:31,891
It was hard to track you down

154
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:44,230
Have you eaten yet?

155
00:36:47,007 --> 00:36:48,406
What time do you get off?

156
00:36:52,346 --> 00:36:54,906
Two hours from now

157
00:36:59,353 --> 00:37:00,877
When are you due back in base?

158
00:37:02,189 --> 00:37:05,352
At 9 tomorrow morning

159
00:37:15,268 --> 00:37:16,360
Have some tea?

160
00:37:16,536 --> 00:37:17,366
Sure

161
00:37:27,848 --> 00:37:28,678
Thank you

162
00:37:39,526 --> 00:37:40,493
Sit down

163
00:37:52,606 --> 00:37:53,504
Cigarette?

164
00:37:54,741 --> 00:37:55,765
Okay

165
00:38:01,782 --> 00:38:03,545
Hey, spare me a cigarette? Cigarette

166
00:40:24,724 --> 00:40:29,559
There are no more trains

167
00:40:32,232 --> 00:40:33,665
What time you have to be there?

168
00:40:34,534 --> 00:40:35,592
Nine in the morning

169
00:40:41,641 --> 00:40:43,438
Then we'd better wait at the car-share place

170
00:42:37,924 --> 00:42:45,456
DADAOCHENG, 1911

171
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:12,944
When did you arrive?

172
00:44:19,058 --> 00:44:22,619
Yesterday... I met Mr Liang on the docks at Keelung

173
00:44:45,618 --> 00:44:48,314
There was a meeting today at the

174
00:44:48,388 --> 00:44:51,289
Eastern Restaurant, and it was packed

175
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,835
You mean the Mr Liang who fled to Japan...

176
00:45:03,903 --> 00:45:07,066
...when the Reform Movement collapsed?

177
00:45:16,382 --> 00:45:20,250
Mr Liang spoke for one hour and wrote out four poems

178
00:45:20,353 --> 00:45:23,811
and we found them deeply moving

179
00:45:41,708 --> 00:45:43,039
One poem read...

180
00:45:43,109 --> 00:45:45,771
"Our homeland is torn asunder

181
00:45:45,879 --> 00:45:48,973
Our brotherly bond is ever tighter"

182
00:47:27,613 --> 00:47:33,415
A TIME FOR FREEDOM

183
00:48:15,995 --> 00:48:19,260
How long will you stay?

184
00:48:30,977 --> 00:48:32,501
Five days

185
00:48:32,578 --> 00:48:36,537
I will go with Mr Liang to Taichung, and then come back north

186
00:49:23,729 --> 00:49:29,258
Before the new year, your son had a fever... has he recovered?

187
00:49:39,112 --> 00:49:44,744
He is well now, but it took two whole months

188
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:12,890
NEXT DAY

189
00:53:46,292 --> 00:53:51,662
We sincerely wish to resolve the matter of redeeming Ah Mei's contract

190
00:54:11,817 --> 00:54:15,048
300 silver dollars is a large sum

191
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:18,420
Is it possible to discuss some more?

192
00:55:09,542 --> 00:55:12,375
Ah Mei is pregnant by the heir to the Su Tea Plantation

193
00:55:12,445 --> 00:55:15,141
He is willing to take her as his concubine

194
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:28,423
What have they decided?

195
00:55:34,233 --> 00:55:36,497
The Su family offers 200 silver dollars

196
00:55:36,569 --> 00:55:39,333
But Madame asks for 300, so they couldn't agree

197
00:55:47,546 --> 00:55:49,980
I will make up the difference for them

198
00:55:59,258 --> 00:56:02,227
In your articles you have always criticize the keeping of concubines

199
00:56:02,294 --> 00:56:04,854
Aren't you acting against your own principles?

200
00:56:13,405 --> 00:56:15,339
I do disapprove of keeping concubines...

201
00:56:15,407 --> 00:56:17,307
...but in this case, I must assent

202
00:56:17,376 --> 00:56:20,504
Ah Mei's future must come first

203
00:57:43,429 --> 00:57:45,226
Mr. Chang, your generosity is overwhelming

204
00:57:45,297 --> 00:57:49,097
Your stay is too short to allow us to show our full gratitude

205
00:57:54,106 --> 00:57:55,596
Travel safely

206
00:57:55,808 --> 00:57:59,403
I will have Ah Mei and her husband thank you in person when you return

207
00:58:42,254 --> 00:58:49,126
SIX DAYS LATER

208
01:00:39,571 --> 01:00:41,766
I can see that Mr Su is honorable

209
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:46,709
His father is also very understanding, you are blessed.

210
01:01:16,241 --> 01:01:19,540
You will be married tomorrow, and your life will be very different

211
01:01:19,611 --> 01:01:22,808
Rise early to serve your in-laws

212
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:34,891
Always defer to the first wife

213
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,293
Never behave willfully.

214
01:02:17,569 --> 01:02:26,341
ONE MONTH LATER

215
01:03:48,627 --> 01:03:50,788
During my travels with Mr Liang

216
01:03:50,862 --> 01:03:52,659
I met many people.

217
01:03:52,731 --> 01:03:55,495
It has been very inspiring.

218
01:04:06,478 --> 01:04:08,969
Mr Liang says China will not be ready...

219
01:04:09,047 --> 01:04:11,675
...to help our people secede from Japan...

220
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:14,651
...for another 3 decades.

221
01:05:24,089 --> 01:05:27,422
This is 100 silver dollars.

222
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:44,775
Many thanks! Ah Mei is truly fortunate to have found such a good family.

223
01:05:56,621 --> 01:05:59,385
Madame is seeking a new girl to adopt

224
01:05:59,458 --> 01:06:03,019
Meanwhile, she asks me to stay here longer

225
01:06:14,172 --> 01:06:18,268
She always promised to release me for marriage...

226
01:06:18,343 --> 01:06:22,074
...once Ah Mei became a top courtesan herself.

227
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:51,980
THE NEXT DAY

228
01:08:17,175 --> 01:08:19,939
 How old are you?

229
01:08:24,583 --> 01:08:27,381
 I am ten.

230
01:09:04,356 --> 01:09:07,985
Good bone structure...

231
01:09:18,937 --> 01:09:22,498
A little skinny.

232
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:56,992
You are pregnant.

233
01:10:57,068 --> 01:10:59,798
Don't overtire yourself.

234
01:11:49,421 --> 01:11:51,548
Today Ah Mei returns

235
01:11:51,623 --> 01:11:54,091
to express her gratitude to you, sir.

236
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:58,027
Without your kind intervention, this would not have happened.

237
01:13:26,651 --> 01:13:30,587
You leave tomorrow, when will you come again?

238
01:13:40,331 --> 01:13:43,459
I will assist Mr Liang with his plan for a newspaper.

239
01:13:43,568 --> 01:13:45,126
I may turn up here at any time.

240
01:14:02,454 --> 01:14:05,685
I have something to ask you...

241
01:14:30,348 --> 01:14:32,111
Last time you said that you assented in Ah Mei's case...

242
01:14:32,183 --> 01:14:36,347
...for the sake of her future.

243
01:14:41,826 --> 01:14:47,025
Now Madame is asking me to stay here longer.

244
01:14:56,074 --> 01:15:01,569
Have you gave a thought about my future?

245
01:17:45,643 --> 01:17:53,379
THREE MONTHS LATER THE WUCHANG UPRISING

246
01:19:52,503 --> 01:19:55,563
"I reached Tokyo a day ago to join Mr Liang"

247
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:58,507
"We leave for Shanghai tomorrow"

248
01:20:05,316 --> 01:20:08,649
"I visited the hall where the treaty ceding Taiwan to Japan was signed"

249
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:11,552
"Thinking of Mr Liang's poem, I couldn't help shedding tears"

250
01:20:21,599 --> 01:20:27,128
"Although this place has torn my heart, it is wrenching to leave it.

251
01:20:33,978 --> 01:20:36,913
"With all that has passed in these 17 years

252
01:20:36,981 --> 01:20:39,814
the tears of the oppressed are not assuaged."

253
01:22:00,231 --> 01:22:09,606
TAIPEI,2005

254
01:23:16,001 --> 01:23:17,161
Are you okay?

255
01:23:46,598 --> 01:23:53,504
A TIME FOR YOUTH

256
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:22,657
Mother, did you just call me?

257
01:25:26,365 --> 01:25:27,332
I see

258
01:25:37,076 --> 01:25:38,373
Are you okay?

259
01:33:25,544 --> 01:33:29,571
"Born premature"

260
01:33:29,648 --> 01:33:32,173
"Showed up too early..."

261
01:33:32,250 --> 01:33:35,913
"High price to pay"

262
01:33:35,987 --> 01:33:40,856
"Fractured bones, a hole in the heart"

263
01:33:40,926 --> 01:33:45,829
"Epilepsy, almost blind in my right eye"

264
01:34:20,865 --> 01:34:24,062
"A yen sign branded on my neck"

265
01:34:24,135 --> 01:34:27,502
"Name your price! I want to sell my soul..."

266
01:34:27,572 --> 01:34:33,101
"No past, no future, just a hungry present"

267
01:35:12,984 --> 01:35:19,753
Please open your eyes

268
01:35:20,792 --> 01:35:23,761
Open your ears

269
01:35:23,828 --> 01:35:27,025
Check you brain

270
01:35:27,899 --> 01:35:33,838
To realize what you want

271
01:35:35,473 --> 01:35:42,106
To realize who you are

272
01:35:43,848 --> 01:35:50,617
No one can decide how you feel

273
01:35:50,889 --> 01:35:53,517
Don't be afraid to

274
01:35:53,591 --> 01:35:57,652
Liberate deep inside your mind

275
01:35:59,397 --> 01:36:03,493
The color which you've seen

276
01:36:03,568 --> 01:36:06,401
The shape which you're in

277
01:36:06,471 --> 01:36:10,430
May reveal the secret

278
01:36:10,508 --> 01:36:13,500
You've never known before

279
01:36:14,079 --> 01:36:20,780
So celebrate when you're honest to yourself

280
01:36:21,853 --> 01:36:28,417
So celebrate when you no need to disregard how you feel

281
01:36:29,427 --> 01:36:36,833
So celebrate when you feel different from mine

282
01:36:36,901 --> 01:36:48,938
Let's celebrate when we no need to tell lie and hide

283
01:40:18,356 --> 01:40:20,620
"I suffer from epilepsy"

284
01:40:22,493 --> 01:40:24,427
"Please do not call an ambulance"

285
01:40:24,996 --> 01:40:27,965
"Please move me to a safe, warm place"

286
01:40:30,535 --> 01:40:32,867
"Taipei Medical University Hospital"

287
01:42:06,264 --> 01:42:07,162
Piss off!

288
01:42:08,699 --> 01:42:09,723
Come home

289
01:42:53,077 --> 01:42:54,271
Don't bug me!

290
01:43:22,106 --> 01:43:23,505
I need napkins

291
01:43:26,144 --> 01:43:27,839
Pass me some napkins

292
01:43:32,116 --> 01:43:32,980
Thanks

293
01:44:12,089 --> 01:44:13,317
Why didn't you take my calls?

294
01:44:17,361 --> 01:44:19,158
I kept ringing, you never picked up

295
01:44:26,204 --> 01:44:28,263
Even if you were sleeping, you could have called back

296
01:44:29,740 --> 01:44:30,900
I was sleeping

297
01:44:31,108 --> 01:44:33,167
Why didn't you call me to say so?

298
01:44:33,311 --> 01:44:34,539
I told you I was tired

299
01:44:39,717 --> 01:44:42,515
Then why did you switch off your phone after my call?

300
01:44:45,122 --> 01:44:46,919
I told you, I had a fit

301
01:44:46,991 --> 01:44:48,925
But right after you texted me

302
01:44:48,993 --> 01:44:50,585
you switched off your phone

303
01:44:51,195 --> 01:44:53,095
I went to sleep right away

304
01:44:53,564 --> 01:44:56,362
You could still have called me

305
01:44:57,835 --> 01:45:00,531
Couldn't you hear your phone?

306
01:45:04,609 --> 01:45:05,871
Couldn't you?

307
01:45:06,744 --> 01:45:07,972
I left it in vibration mode

308
01:45:19,824 --> 01:45:21,758
Don't be angry

309
01:45:22,827 --> 01:45:24,260
Don't be angry

310
01:45:25,396 --> 01:45:27,193
If you were me, what would you think?

311
01:45:45,249 --> 01:45:46,773
I'll wait for you when you finish, okay?

312
01:48:08,426 --> 01:48:10,986
TEXT MESSAGE

313
01:48:11,095 --> 01:48:15,725
"Can't sleep, miss you, you left your epilepsy card at my place"

314
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:21,830
"Developed the photos, will show you tomorrow"

315
01:48:42,693 --> 01:48:45,662
I burn my hand every time I light a candle with this lighter.

316
01:48:45,729 --> 01:48:47,162
My thumb hurts.

317
01:48:51,769 --> 01:48:53,634
It's almost run out.

318
01:48:53,704 --> 01:48:55,069
I can hardly light this one.

319
01:48:56,907 --> 01:48:58,033
Pass that one to me.

320
01:49:00,444 --> 01:49:01,411
Thanks.

321
01:49:02,913 --> 01:49:05,108
We'll light this one later.

322
01:49:12,590 --> 01:49:13,488
And that one.

323
01:49:13,557 --> 01:49:14,717
That one too.

324
01:49:21,632 --> 01:49:23,600
Has water gone inside?

325
01:49:24,134 --> 01:49:25,795
You hear that funny sound?

326
01:49:27,171 --> 01:49:28,399
The wick is wet.

327
01:49:28,906 --> 01:49:30,168
Let's buy some new ones tomorrow.

328
01:49:30,574 --> 01:49:31,598
There are two left.

329
01:49:38,082 --> 01:49:39,310
The water is dirty.

330
01:49:39,517 --> 01:49:41,485
Can you change it later?

331
01:49:43,687 --> 01:49:45,484
Is it because of the candle wax?

332
01:49:46,957 --> 01:49:48,254
I can't even light them

333
01:49:56,734 --> 01:50:00,966
Shall I put some fragrant oils in the bath?

334
01:50:02,773 --> 01:50:03,637
Okay

335
01:50:03,974 --> 01:50:05,168
Let's bathe together.

336
01:50:07,645 --> 01:50:10,079
I'll take silence as a 'Yes'

337
01:50:11,482 --> 01:50:12,278
Okay

338
01:50:13,117 --> 01:50:14,482
I'll go get clothes

339
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:45,207
"The pictures taken before

340
01:50:45,282 --> 01:50:47,443

"May rest, such cruel sound

342
01:50:59,096 --> 01:51:01,087
Jing! It's ready, hurry up!

343
01:51:04,234 --> 01:51:13,541
"It's still vivid, like a bird"

344
01:51:24,088 --> 01:51:26,556
Jing...

345
01:51:31,962 --> 01:51:32,929
You're still awake?

346
01:51:32,997 --> 01:51:33,793
Grandma made some chicken soup

347
01:51:33,897 --> 01:51:34,886
I'll get some for you?

348
01:51:37,668 --> 01:51:38,362
Jing!

349
01:51:40,070 --> 01:51:41,037
Grandma made some chicken soup

350
01:51:41,138 --> 01:51:42,196
I'll get some for you?

351
01:51:42,539 --> 01:51:43,471
Okay

352
01:54:08,952 --> 01:54:10,044
Sorry, I'm late

353
01:54:10,554 --> 01:54:11,578
I called you just now

354
01:54:12,156 --> 01:54:13,248
But you didn't answer

355
01:54:18,729 --> 01:54:19,627
The photos.

356
01:55:01,205 --> 01:55:02,536
Go to your place.

357
01:56:51,048 --> 01:56:52,015
Jing?

358
01:57:09,599 --> 01:57:10,531
Jing?

359
01:57:25,615 --> 01:57:28,345
"One missed call"

360
01:57:39,396 --> 01:57:44,060
"Connecting..."

361
01:59:51,695 --> 01:59:54,562
You must have gone out before 12:45.

362
01:59:54,731 --> 01:59:55,663
You left your cell phone here.

363
01:59:55,732 --> 01:59:57,097
I think you did it on purpose.

364
01:59:57,200 --> 01:59:58,929
To make me think you had...

365
01:59:59,102 --> 02:00:00,091
just stepped out for a minute.

366
02:00:00,303 --> 02:00:03,363
Your last missed call was at 12.45.

367
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:05,904
So you'd have gone by then.

368
02:00:06,176 --> 02:00:07,734
Now it's 3:33.

369
02:00:07,844 --> 02:00:09,209
You've been out for over 3 hours.

370
02:00:09,412 --> 02:00:10,936
You knew I'd wake up at 4.

371
02:00:11,081 --> 02:00:12,241
I don't want to hear any more of your lies.

372
02:00:12,349 --> 02:00:13,247
I'm fed up with waiting for you.

373
02:00:13,383 --> 02:00:14,577
You keep pushing me.

374
02:00:15,418 --> 02:00:17,477
You know that I love you more than you love me.

375
02:00:18,088 --> 02:00:19,146
You'll regret this

376
02:00:19,289 --> 02:00:21,655
I will kill myself just like Olika.

377
02:02:28,652 --> 02:02:31,018
"I think you did it on purpose"

378
02:02:31,321 --> 02:02:34,449
"Your last missed call was at 12:45"

379
02:02:34,758 --> 02:02:38,091
"You've been out for over 3 hours"

380
02:02:38,161 --> 02:02:41,790
"I don't want to hear anymore of your lies"

381
02:02:42,098 --> 02:02:44,532
"I'm fed up with waiting for you"

382
02:02:44,968 --> 02:02:47,994
"You keep pushing me"

383
02:02:48,071 --> 02:02:51,302
"You know that I love you more than you love me"

384
02:02:51,374 --> 02:02:53,433
"You'll regret this"

385
02:02:53,510 --> 02:02:56,001
"I will kill myself just like Olika"
