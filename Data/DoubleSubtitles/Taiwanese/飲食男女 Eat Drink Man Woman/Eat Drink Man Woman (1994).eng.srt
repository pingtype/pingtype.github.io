1
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:33,329
EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN

2
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:40,073
Hello? Have you eaten? Not yet?

3
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,812
Just throw together some noodles
for lunch.

4
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,115
That fish is excellent.

5
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:50,384
Don't roast it. That would be a pity.

6
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,391
It just needs to be slightly steamed.

7
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,961
Don't add any salt!
Whatever you do, no salt!

8
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,390
Salt dries the fish, and it won't be tender.

9
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,963
Just get a pot of boiling water,
and put salt around the plate.

10
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:11,176
If not today,
then when will we talk about it?

11
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,301
Small coke, three chickens?

12
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,475
That'll be 100 yuan.

13
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,276
- I ordered chicken!
- That is chicken!

14
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,786
I can't cover for you today.
Guo-Lun is taking me to the beach.

15
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,086
You have to! Father'll kill me
if I'm late for Sunday dinner again.

16
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,787
And I thought you and Guo-Lun broke up!

17
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,591
We did.
I just want to torture him a bit more.

18
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,792
Then torture him
by keeping him waiting an hour.

19
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,535
- Hurry up!
- Great idea!

20
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,585
<i>- Hello?
- How's the new boyfriend?</i>

21
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,818
<i>Hi, Jia-Chien.
Still working on a Sunday afternoon?</i>

22
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:37,453
<i>New boyfriend's okay, pretty quiet.
Especially after Bo-Kang.</i>

23
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:38,757
Sounds good.

24
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,492
<i>Let's get together later?
Don't work so hard!</i>

25
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:46,037
<i>- Thanks, but I'm seeing Raymond later.
- Raymond?</i>

26
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,239
What does that mean?

27
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:51,275
<i>The difference between Christians
and ordinary people...</i>

28
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:54,710
<i>... is not only do we have eternal hope...</i>

29
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,647
<i>... but we also rely on God...</i>

30
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,579
<i>... to give us wisdom
to overcome our difficulties...</i>

31
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:06,454
<i>... and to give us joyfulness and peace
to settle our frustrations.</i>

32
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,046
You okay?

33
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,883
Yeah. Just a little wound up.

34
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:43,919
Work, you know,
and I just closed on the new apartment.

35
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,726
All my savings...

36
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,602
...but it'll be worth it
to get out of that house.

37
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,733
That was wonderful.

38
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:58,443
- Better than when we were together.
- It's much easier like this.

39
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:04,481
We were a disaster as a couple.
All that shouting and fighting.

40
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,981
You want to come down
to my gallery now?

41
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:15,322
A new woman artist. You'd like her work.

42
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,920
I have to get home
for the Sunday dinner torture ritual.

43
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,565
Punch your time card.

44
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:31,302
- Change my Sunday schedule, please?
- I'll see what I can do.

45
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,881
Hi, Guo-Lun.

46
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,952
- Hi.
- I'm Chu Jia-Ning.

47
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,719
Rachel asked me to tell you
she'll be an hour late.

48
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,322
Shit! How dare she!

49
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:53,330
Don't be angry!
It's just an hour, even less now.

50
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:56,401
It's not the first time
she's made a fool of me.

51
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,266
- It's not serious.
- What would you know?

52
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,270
Have you loved someone who hates you...

53
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,400
...who hurts you every day?

54
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,479
It's my fault, really.
She forgot she was covering for me.

55
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,515
I didn't know I'd cause so much suffering.

56
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,709
You're not to blame. It's me.

57
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:17,089
I want to end this addiction to love,
but I'm too weak.

58
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,525
- Well, I'd better be going.
- Bye.

59
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:25,459
Will you tell Rachel to bring back
the red shirt she borrowed?

60
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,765
She can bring it to work.

61
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,394
Whatever.

62
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,632
What are you reading?

63
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,772
Dostoyevsky.

64
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,599
Bye.

65
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,265
- Thank you.
- Promise me we'll go to choir practice?

66
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,598
I'll think about it.

67
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,697
Brother Chai is the handsomest man
in the congregation...

68
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,275
...and he loves your voice!

69
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:13,812
Sister Chang,
I don't wish to be liked only for my voice!

70
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,313
I'll never find a husband for you!

71
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,312
Then stop trying.

72
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:03,958
Dear God, please bring luck to our family...

73
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,787
...we are happy to have God in our hearts...

74
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:11,028
...and thank you so much
for this terrific dinner...

75
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,300
...and thank you again for bringing
our family together with happiness.

76
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,605
In the name of Jesus Christ, thank you.
Amen.

77
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,288
These past two days, I...

78
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:45,570
- Something wrong?
- No, it's fine.

79
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:55,707
Nothing.

80
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,544
Say it!

81
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,379
The ham was oversmoked.

82
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,523
- It's fine.
- Father probably forgot to taste it.

83
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:11,490
- Or his taste is getting worse.
- My taste is fine!

84
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,297
- Yesterday...
- Our school...

85
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,461
You first.

86
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:22,032
Jin-Feng called from America.
Her mother is coming back.

87
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:26,100
- But her green card?
- She just can't stand it anymore.

88
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:30,209
They fight and fight. Even the police came.

89
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:33,581
Mrs. Liang is really hell on wheels.

90
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,714
She can't live there.

91
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:39,450
The language,
no companion for mah-jongg...

92
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:43,654
...her son-in-law isn't Chinese.
It's a miracle she lasted that long.

93
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:48,257
It might be a good thing for Jin-Rong.
She can help take care of Shan-Shan.

94
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,267
- She might cause more stress.
- It'll be fine.

95
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,032
And Dad will have someone to chat with.

96
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,907
Like I have time to gossip
after taking care of you three?

97
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,580
These past two days, I...

98
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,080
What now?

99
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,047
I have a little announcement to make.

100
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,987
Have you seen the TV ads
for "Little Paris in the East"?

101
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,855
That new luxury apartment building
in Hsin-Den?

102
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:22,627
A friend, who knows the contractors,
told me how well-built it is.

103
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,236
He was able to get my bid in
for a good price.

104
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,998
You're moving out?

105
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:30,398
Not immediately, of course.
It isn't ready yet.

106
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:33,569
I used most of my savings for the deposit.

107
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,044
That's good.

108
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:38,411
Real estate is a smart investment today.

109
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:42,379
Then I'll move
when the apartment is ready?

110
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,157
<i>- Hello?
- I need to speak with your dad!</i>

111
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,888
Dad, it's for you.

112
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,590
<i>- Hello?
- Hurry here, I need your help...</i>

113
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,559
What? Right away!

114
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,639
There are crab dumplings in the steamer!

115
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,577
Get them out
when you're ready to eat them!

116
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,072
Master Chu, how are you?

117
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,216
Master Chu, how are you?

118
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,455
Hello, Master Chu.

119
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,756
Hello, Master Chu.

120
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,670
- Serve the sea cucumbers first! Hurry!
- Master Chu is here!

121
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,999
Thank God, you're here!

122
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,905
- Where's Old Wen?
- Over here! What a mess!

123
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:15,510
The boss wanted the banquet to be perfect.
Now look at this mess!

124
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,074
- The menu?
- Here.

125
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,778
What's going on? Hurry up!

126
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,530
It's all right.
The last four courses are stews.

127
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,133
We'll make the Whole Shark Fin,
and problem solved.

128
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:39,067
With you here, I can relax.
You can take charge here. I'll be up front.

129
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:42,106
The guy who bought the fins
didn't know anything.

130
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:45,574
It looked genuine,
but it fell apart when we cooked it.

131
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,448
Fake fins don't have elasticity
when boiled in hot water.

132
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:56,020
There's no flavor,
no matter how long you cook it.

133
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,147
What will we do now?
It's a wedding for the General's son!

134
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,725
This is only good for gravy.

135
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:03,420
The Whole Shark Fin dish
will look like a porcupine.

136
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,520
We'll make Joy Luck Dragon Phoenix.

137
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:09,566
- Abalone? We'll lose money on this!
- Money is not important now.

138
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:14,071
We'll first settle the situation,
and I'll explain this to the boss later.

139
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:17,820
Let's get ready, everyone!
I need lobsters, abalone and jade prawns!

140
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,741
On the 10th floor,
and the windows face south.

141
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,314
Central air conditioning?

142
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:26,374
Of course. There's also a guest room
for you to stay when you visit.

143
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,012
What's wrong?

144
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,685
Nothing.

145
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,285
I don't know why I'm upset.

146
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,853
I should be happy for her.

147
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:41,833
No, I understand.
I should be the one apologizing.

148
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:44,232
I shouldn't leave Father in your hands...

149
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,238
...but I just can't live here
with him any more.

150
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:52,844
Even though I'll be just a few miles away,
it's like being in another world.

151
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:57,349
- I don't blame you for being upset.
- Why should we be upset?

152
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,113
It's just a matter of time before you
or Jia-Jen gets married and moves out.

153
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,779
What's the difference?

154
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:06,222
I'm acting upset because
I worry how Father will take it.

155
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,658
He can barely stand
the sight of me these days.

156
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:12,754
We hardly speak to each other.
It will be a great relief for everyone.

157
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,991
Anyhow, Dad doesn't need us around.

158
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:17,763
What he really needs
is a companion his own age...

159
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,566
...like Mrs. Liang.

160
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,104
That's not even funny.

161
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:24,004
We've tried setting him up,
and it's been a disaster.

162
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,602
The only true love in his life
was our mother.

163
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,581
- You call bickering and fighting love?
- What do you know?

164
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,742
Maybe it's not romance to you...

165
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:35,980
...but it was founded on real
old-fashioned respect and values.

166
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:40,458
It was an old-fashioned war
that ended only when Mom died!

167
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,491
How would you know?
You were a kid when she died.

168
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,530
I was old enough to know her better.

169
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:47,190
Stop it, you two.

170
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,500
Try it.

171
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,444
This is how it's done.

172
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,006
Jin-Rong is here!

173
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:39,073
Hi.

174
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:42,086
You're all here. Where's Uncle Chu?

175
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:44,656
Something came up at the restaurant.
He went to help.

176
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:47,555
Jia-Chien is busy in her room.
Have you eaten?

177
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,790
- It's 8:00! Of course we ate.
- Today, Mom burned the fish.

178
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,092
I didn't bring you along to complain.

179
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:57,635
I'll give you some of Grandpa Chu's
crab dumplings to take home.

180
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:01,002
- You got a haircut.
- Yes. I run around like crazy every day.

181
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:03,632
I don't have time to care for it.
It's easier short.

182
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,768
- You look younger.
- Really?

183
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:08,177
I wanted to look more professional.

184
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:10,112
Can we go draw now?

185
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,216
Can we draw Grandpa Chu today?

186
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:28,461
- Was it really that bad?
- Who knows?

187
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:32,037
They were both crying and fussing.
Mom said Jin-Feng wasn't being filial.

188
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:35,232
Jin-Feng said if Mom stayed with them,
she'd end up divorced.

189
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,538
If Jin-Feng got a divorce, too,
my mother really couldn't take it.

190
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,875
I still feel that Jin-Feng should care for her.

191
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,108
With your current situation,
you have a job, take care of a child...

192
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:47,152
...take care of an elder person,
and deal with your divorce?

193
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:50,848
Which just got worse. He hired
a private investigator to have me followed.

194
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:52,117
Really?

195
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,019
He'll do anything to take
Shan-Shan away from me.

196
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:58,495
I can't wait for the final decree.

197
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:02,765
- Why don't you tell her to come back later?
- Forget it.

198
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:06,403
You and Jin-Feng were old schoolmates.
You know her.

199
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:09,600
Mother always wanted to be with me
instead of her.

200
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,768
Same thing here.

201
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,406
Father wants to live with me.

202
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:16,141
It's not the same.

203
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:20,475
Uncle Chu is much stronger than my mom.
He takes care of himself and others.

204
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:22,919
Unlike my mother,
who needs constant attention.

205
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,819
My dad needs attention, too.

206
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:27,791
How many more Sunday dinners
can we have?

207
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,385
Jia-Ning is young,
Jia-Chien is independent...

208
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,431
...so I'll have to take care of Dad
for the rest of my life.

209
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:35,558
I'm sure he doesn't want that.

210
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:38,671
Mom, look.
Auntie's drawing of Grandpa Chu.

211
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,698
It's time to go home.

212
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:44,944
Wait, I'll get the dumplings.

213
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,512
Please, don't.
We're always taking food home.

214
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:51,050
Don't worry,
you're like another daughter in this family.

215
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:54,176
So you really are like Dad's granddaughter.

216
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:57,688
- I want to show this to Grandpa Chu.
- Don't, Shan-Shan!

217
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:00,591
I want to show this to Grandpa Chu!

218
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:06,829
- Stop running.
- Okay.

219
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,924
I lied, I lied!

220
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,104
Those dumplings are fresh.
Take them home to your kids.

221
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:21,271
Do you want this to go?

222
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:24,475
Old Chu, don't get upset.

223
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:28,044
Girls eventually leave home.
It was bound to happen.

224
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:29,683
I'm not upset.

225
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,451
I hope they all move out,
so I can have a quiet life.

226
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:35,049
Quiet life? I know you.

227
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:39,325
What you want, you can't get.
What you don't want, you can't get rid of.

228
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,901
You're as repressed as a turtle.

229
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:49,074
That old maid of yours, Jia-Jen,
will stick to you for life...

230
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:52,076
...unless you marry her off!

231
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:53,475
Marry who?

232
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,507
Since she lost her asshole
college boyfriend...

233
00:21:57,617 --> 00:22:00,415
...she's never looked at another man.

234
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:02,486
You know that.

235
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:05,357
And now she has the perfect boyfriend:

236
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,823
Jesus Christ.

237
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:09,390
Don't make fun of her religion!

238
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:14,726
How is it that for 30 years I have
put up with this kind of talk from you?

239
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,367
The truth is...

240
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,998
...you should be thankful
someone's around to tell you the truth.

241
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:27,007
That Jia-Chien's temper...
She was spoiled as a child.

242
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:28,944
I can't take it anymore.

243
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,876
That girl just didn't come from nowhere.

244
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:36,115
Jia-Chien's a perfect blend
of you and her mother.

245
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,753
Her mother's stubbornness and willfulness.

246
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,327
And the pickiness and pomposity...

247
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:44,820
...come straight from you!

248
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:48,659
I think I know her better than you do.

249
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:53,202
I don't understand any of them,
and I don't want to know.

250
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:55,365
Let them grow up and leave.

251
00:22:55,508 --> 00:22:57,032
It's like cooking.

252
00:22:57,143 --> 00:22:59,873
Your appetite's gone
when the dish is done.

253
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:03,676
That's not the worst thing.
At least people like your cooking.

254
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:08,477
Honestly, I'd have to give that up
if it hadn't been for you lately.

255
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:11,720
My sense of taste
is getting worse and worse.

256
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:14,987
My food is only as good
as the expression on your face.

257
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:16,254
Don't be silly.

258
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:21,061
You rely on your feelings when you cook,
not your taste buds.

259
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,703
Like that Western deaf composer,
called Bee...

260
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:27,772
- Beethoven.
- That's right, Beethoven.

261
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,400
Good sound is not in the ear,
good taste is not in the mouth...

262
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:34,236
...and good sex...

263
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:37,707
...God knows where.

264
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:39,949
You're drunk.

265
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:44,345
Eat, drink, man, woman.
Basic human desires.

266
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:46,049
Can't avoid them.

267
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:49,527
All my life, every day,
that's all I've ever done.

268
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:53,156
It pisses me off. Is that all there is to life?

269
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:57,267
We should be thankful
that we're still alive and cooking.

270
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,498
By the way, when will you have
your recipes written up?

271
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:02,172
What recipes?

272
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:06,769
Didn't you say that you wanted to write
down the great recipes from your memory?

273
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:09,712
I'm just afraid that one day, you'II...

274
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:11,249
God damn you!

275
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:15,653
Are you counting the days
to take advantage of the opportunity?

276
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,547
Here, taste this!

277
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:43,972
Little daughter?

278
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:47,843
It's 6:00.

279
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:51,715
Get up, lazy-bones.

280
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:12,604
Jia-Chien, get up!

281
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,479
How many times have I told you
not to fall asleep at your desk?

282
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,516
It's bad for your posture.

283
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,917
And didn't the doctor tell you that
jogging was bad for your back?

284
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,388
- Shan-Shan!
- Good morning, Grandpa Chu.

285
00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:59,856
Morning! Off to school?
Why are you eating your breakfast here?

286
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:02,450
I don't have time for breakfast.

287
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:05,053
Look! Your dumplings from yesterday.

288
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:10,100
But Mom squeezed the juice out,
so I wouldn't get my hands all greasy.

289
00:26:10,303 --> 00:26:13,101
Come to my house at noon,
and I'll make lunch for you.

290
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:15,332
- I have school all day.
- All day?

291
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:17,375
Then where's your lunch box?

292
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:18,636
Here.

293
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,538
The bus is here!

294
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,290
The valence electron of a typical element...

295
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:44,093
...is equal to its groups.

296
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:49,234
And its valence electron in turn
is equal to its groups. Understood?

297
00:26:49,342 --> 00:26:53,039
Okay, let's look at the periodic table
of the elements again.

298
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:54,669
The Group A elements:

299
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:56,615
1A...

300
00:26:57,183 --> 00:26:58,150
...2A...

301
00:26:58,484 --> 00:26:59,382
...3A...

302
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:07,559
Pay attention.

303
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:12,395
...4A, 5A, 6, 7, 8...

304
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:17,664
Okay, let's use the color red for Group 1A.
Let's take a look.

305
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:23,298
- Who will return the ball?
- I'll go!

306
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,947
Very well, then I'll do it.

307
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:37,087
Hey, where'd it go? Give it back.

308
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:39,917
Sorry!

309
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:42,318
Sorry! We missed!

310
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:43,959
It's okay.

311
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:47,130
- I'll come up and get it.
- I can throw it down.

312
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,192
She's throwing the bouquet!

313
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:57,499
Let's continue!

314
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:03,773
What's going on? What's in your hand?

315
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:05,441
Nothing, Teacher.

316
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:09,209
- Bring it here, let me see it.
- There's nothing to see.

317
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:10,788
Bring it here!

318
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:13,352
Sit down!

319
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:16,461
Give it to me.

320
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:24,669
Writing love letters in chemistry class?

321
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:27,432
Love letters are
a kind of chemical catalyst.

322
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:29,968
- Someone wrote it to me.
- So what?

323
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:32,374
What is this doing in class?

324
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:35,604
Showing off?
Who hasn't received love letters before?

325
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:45,090
<i>"A la fin tu es las de ce monde ancien</i>

326
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,130
<i>"Berg¨¨re? Tour Eiffel
le troupeau des ponts b¨ºle ce matin"</i>

327
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:22,186
The American airline industry
is going through a recession.

328
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:26,196
This is a golden opportunity for us
to bid for the Sydney to Bangkok routes...

329
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:28,630
...which the British are also eyeing.

330
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:32,795
They will be our toughest competition,
and the fight will be fierce.

331
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:39,635
I'll be able to put a price
on these routes within two weeks...

332
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:43,681
...and I feel that there is
significant potential in all of them.

333
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:49,111
Good.

334
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:51,653
Thank you, Deputy Director Chu,
for that report.

335
00:29:51,757 --> 00:29:54,590
Obviously,
this plan poses real opportunities...

336
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:57,093
...for the growth of our company.

337
00:29:57,196 --> 00:30:01,257
The question is, "Do we have enough
airplanes to handle all these cities?"

338
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,198
Be quiet. What do you know?

339
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:14,507
That kid. My son just graduated.

340
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:16,775
He'll get it slowly.

341
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:18,716
That's right.

342
00:30:19,218 --> 00:30:20,981
Our chief negotiator!

343
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,314
Everyone, please welcome Mr. Li Kai.

344
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:27,890
He was the one who single-handedly...

345
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:31,258
...fought to get us our Amsterdam routes.

346
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:34,231
I'm very happy to see him
as a part of our team.

347
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:37,564
My apologies for being late.
My flight was delayed.

348
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:43,502
Always kidding.

349
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:47,902
We have a big battle to wage.

350
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:51,706
I want to announce that
Li Kai is our general in charge.

351
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:56,783
We are to give him
the manpower and assistance he needs.

352
00:30:57,323 --> 00:31:00,053
By following this order,
one observes the energy...

353
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,252
...of the chemical element rising.

354
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:05,429
- Go home, study hard. Class dismissed.
- Attention.

355
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:08,165
Stand straight. Bow.

356
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:11,361
Thank you, Teacher.

357
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:18,871
Over here, over here.

358
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:23,344
To the left, to the left!

359
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:25,841
- Got it!
- Good!

360
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:45,459
Is it broken?

361
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:50,664
What happened?

362
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:54,210
- Coach dislocated his shoulder.
- Dislocated?

363
00:31:54,313 --> 00:31:56,440
My right shoulder always goes.

364
00:31:57,283 --> 00:32:00,719
- We need to rush him to the hospital.
- They're getting Coach Chai.

365
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:02,286
What for?

366
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:05,747
What's up? Out again? Come on!

367
00:32:14,867 --> 00:32:17,199
Thanks, Coach! It's as good as new.

368
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:20,739
- C'mon, let's keep going.
- That's it for today.

369
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:22,806
Break it up.

370
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:47,221
<i>Please hurry, and leave for your lunch hour.</i>

371
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:54,404
Teacher,
I'm bringing Shan-Shan her lunch box.

372
00:32:58,177 --> 00:33:02,307
I didn't have much time to make you
more than a few small dishes.

373
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:08,950
Spareribs, crab with vegetables...

374
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:15,356
...shrimp with green peas,
bean sprouts and sliced chicken...

375
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:18,988
...and your favorite,
spareribs and bitter melon soup.

376
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:21,792
It's not much,
because I was afraid you can't finish.

377
00:33:21,934 --> 00:33:23,959
Come on, eat while it's hot.

378
00:34:14,987 --> 00:34:17,285
- Sorry.
- Are you catching a bus?

379
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:21,724
- Your shoulder? Can you ride?
- No problem.

380
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:25,663
Tomorrow, I'll spike the ball again.
Next week's the big tournament.

381
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:29,165
- I haven't seen you before.
- I'm the new volleyball coach.

382
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:31,498
- I'm Chou Ming-Dao.
- Chu Jia-Jen.

383
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:34,037
- Where do you live?
- Her-Ping East Road.

384
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,539
- That's a nice area.
- It's an old house.

385
00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:39,509
I would have given you a ride
if it were on the way.

386
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:42,739
- The bus is convenient.
- Well, I'm off.

387
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,744
Come and root for the team next week.

388
00:35:19,051 --> 00:35:20,746
Why are you here?

389
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,183
Guess. I'm here for Rachel...

390
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,554
...who will no doubt keep me waiting
for another hour again.

391
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,684
- I doubt it.
- How do you know?

392
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:33,390
She got off work an hour ago.
She said she was going home.

393
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:43,164
Try this. It tastes great.

394
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:45,242
The smell is making me sick.

395
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:47,642
You're just feeling sorry for yourself.

396
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:50,715
No, I feel wonderful. Love is torture.

397
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:54,344
I know that deep in her heart,
she truly loves me.

398
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:57,320
But she told me she doesn't love you at all.

399
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,782
If she doesn't love me...

400
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:02,292
...then why is she wasting her energy
torturing me?

401
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:05,386
That's not true love.
You hardly know each other.

402
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:07,158
You two hardly even talk.

403
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:09,631
Tell me,
when was your last real conversation...

404
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:12,727
...about your thoughts, feelings and life?

405
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:17,407
I can't remember. It's all a blur now.

406
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,740
I'll tell you what's a blur: Your idea of love.

407
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:23,371
True love is being with someone
who loves you.

408
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:26,042
You can feel free to express your feelings.

409
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:29,211
Next to her,
you can feel free to talk about anything.

410
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:32,119
But I feel free to talk
about my feelings around you.

411
00:36:32,224 --> 00:36:33,851
Is that true love?

412
00:36:37,129 --> 00:36:38,619
Don't be silly!

413
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,363
Here's your Stinky Tofu.

414
00:36:50,943 --> 00:36:52,240
Bye.

415
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:17,361
He's still jet-lagged.
He flew in and came straight to work.

416
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,203
Cute, isn't he?

417
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:49,659
The best way to increase sexual prowess...

418
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:52,565
...is to mix 3 ounces of ginseng,
3 ounces of aloe vera...

419
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:55,105
...and 8 ounces of dried sea cucumber.

420
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,754
- What are you doing?
- That cat's driving me crazy.

421
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:22,056
At least someone's
having some fun around here.

422
00:38:23,035 --> 00:38:25,970
Here they are.
No wonder I couldn't find them.

423
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:32,303
I'm sorry about that crack.

424
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:35,174
- I'm sure you'll find someone...
- Oh, please!

425
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,908
Why does everyone think
I'm looking for a boyfriend?

426
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:40,484
I already found someone, thank you.

427
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:44,281
Sis, it's been nine years.
You can't still be heartbroken...

428
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:46,857
- None of your business.
- Fine, then.

429
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:56,729
It's agreed, then.
I'll make you a lunch box every day.

430
00:38:56,835 --> 00:39:00,032
But sometimes Mama makes me
a lunch box. Then what?

431
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:03,335
We'll trade. I'll eat your lunch,
and your mom won't find out.

432
00:39:03,442 --> 00:39:06,673
Can you make one for Chen Pei-Hsin, too?
She's my best friend.

433
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:08,871
We had to eat hamburgers every day.

434
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:12,211
No problem.
It's a simple job, just more ingredients.

435
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:14,182
Thank you, Grandpa Chu!

436
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:29,200
Chief.

437
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:42,643
- Your plant is dying.
- I always forget to water it.

438
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:48,285
- You can't take it with you, anyhow.
- Am I fired?

439
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:50,685
Let's not jump to any conclusions.

440
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:55,749
Of course, it's premature to tell you this.
I still need approval from the board.

441
00:39:56,027 --> 00:40:00,157
I've recommended you to be vice-president
of our Amsterdam office...

442
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:02,866
...in charge of all our operations.

443
00:40:03,168 --> 00:40:04,499
Chief, I...

444
00:40:05,137 --> 00:40:08,664
Frankly,
you're much too young for the position...

445
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:10,936
...and too beautiful.

446
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:14,237
But all the men I've sent over are idiots...

447
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,577
...so you'll have to do.

448
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:18,750
But, Chief, I...

449
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:23,248
Everyone wants this job.
What are you waiting for?

450
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:27,057
- I just purchased an apartment.
- Rent it out.

451
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:29,354
You'll probably make a profit.

452
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:33,720
Then again, let's wait until the board
confirms your appointment.

453
00:40:53,385 --> 00:40:55,114
I felt like cooking.

454
00:40:57,556 --> 00:40:59,490
The kitchen is all yours.

455
00:41:21,413 --> 00:41:23,142
This is Tsu-An Tofu.

456
00:41:23,582 --> 00:41:27,541
Unfortunately, you don't have
a bamboo steamer, but taste it anyway.

457
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,614
- Where's the tofu?
- The tofu is blended in with the chicken.

458
00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:34,988
It's steamed in the pot
until it looks like a beehive...

459
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:38,893
...which is then cut into pieces
and stewed with ham in an old hen broth.

460
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,555
You shouldn't have rewarded me like this.

461
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,794
I like cooking elaborate dishes.
I wish I could do it at home.

462
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:49,100
- You can't cook tofu at home?
- No, I can't cook at home.

463
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:52,708
- Doesn't your dad have a big kitchen?
- Yes.

464
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:57,505
But it's off-limits to me.
If I cooked there, he'd come and stop me...

465
00:41:57,616 --> 00:41:59,550
...as if I'd be stealing his thunder.

466
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:07,547
Carp with garlic sauce,
the first dish Uncle Wen taught me.

467
00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:14,196
And this is duck-oil saut¨¦ed pea sprout.
One duck, two dishes.

468
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:17,530
Duck saut¨¦ed with garlic.
A perfect balance.

469
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:22,036
It's an ancient philosophy: Food balanced
with energy, flavor and nature.

470
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,938
This I understand.
Like balancing yin and yang.

471
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:29,245
Take your time.
There's also a tofu dumpling coming up.

472
00:42:29,648 --> 00:42:31,445
There's enough for 10 people.

473
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:35,953
I always cook in large servings,
because I learned in a large restaurant.

474
00:42:36,421 --> 00:42:38,548
- That kitchen...
- What?

475
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:42,585
It's strange,
I don't have any childhood memories...

476
00:42:42,694 --> 00:42:45,162
...unless I cook them into existence.

477
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,096
I can't remember a thing
from my childhood.

478
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:52,363
You wouldn't believe
how fun and warm my father used to be.

479
00:42:53,505 --> 00:42:56,030
Back then, after school,
before the dinner rush...

480
00:42:56,141 --> 00:42:58,837
...he'd bake me bracelets made of bread.

481
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,941
I used to have a ring...

482
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:06,206
...full of spices and sugar diamonds
made from dough.

483
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:09,820
He enjoyed letting me play
in the big kitchen.

484
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,889
Jia-Jen was so jealous.

485
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:16,327
- Here, wear this squid ring, and then eat it.
- Don't play.

486
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:18,419
How about nibbling my earring?

487
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:21,264
Stop playing.

488
00:43:25,337 --> 00:43:27,931
I'm sorry I got so sentimental tonight.

489
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:33,437
No, I just had too much to eat.

490
00:43:38,717 --> 00:43:40,378
The pepper smells good.

491
00:43:47,025 --> 00:43:48,185
How is it?

492
00:43:48,526 --> 00:43:49,823
Too spicy?

493
00:43:50,328 --> 00:43:53,786
Say something!
Don't make me guess your expressions.

494
00:43:55,734 --> 00:43:58,396
Old Wen!

495
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:08,270
Name, address, social security number,
family status, relatives.

496
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:12,111
If he needs special care,
please fill out this bottom section.

497
00:44:12,584 --> 00:44:15,849
- Dad.
- You're here. It's okay now.

498
00:44:16,554 --> 00:44:19,182
They ran some tests in the ER.
He feels better now.

499
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:22,748
- Was it a heart attack?
- We'll have to do more tests.

500
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:25,686
- Do you have a pen?
- I'll fill it out.

501
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:33,968
Uncle Wen.

502
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:35,803
Jia-Chien.

503
00:44:36,941 --> 00:44:41,878
Just like me to be practically killed
by a fart.

504
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:45,248
Blame your father's cooking.

505
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:48,451
His cooking is getting worse and worse
these days.

506
00:44:48,653 --> 00:44:50,245
You had too much of it.

507
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:52,619
Come on, give Uncle Wen a hug.

508
00:44:56,895 --> 00:45:00,058
- Why'd you grow up to be so pretty?
- To be courted by men.

509
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:04,133
It seems like only yesterday,
you were a little girl...

510
00:45:04,803 --> 00:45:08,068
...following your father and I
around the kitchen.

511
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,830
Back and forth.

512
00:45:11,242 --> 00:45:15,372
You were so smart.
You learned everything just once.

513
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:19,544
- What a talent. Right, Old Chu?
- Of course.

514
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,782
What's the use?
You still banished me from the kitchen.

515
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:27,380
It was for your own good.
You should learn something useful.

516
00:45:27,592 --> 00:45:29,992
You just can't accept a woman
being a great chef.

517
00:45:30,095 --> 00:45:32,689
Don't start again, you two. Jia-Chien...

518
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:37,930
...if you wanted to be a chef,
you would've been one of the greats.

519
00:45:38,303 --> 00:45:41,670
But your father was right
to send you to college.

520
00:45:42,207 --> 00:45:44,072
You should thank your father...

521
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:47,268
...for throwing you out
of our smelly kitchen.

522
00:45:47,378 --> 00:45:50,370
Otherwise,
you wouldn't have what you have today.

523
00:45:51,015 --> 00:45:53,711
No one ever asked me if I'd appreciate this.

524
00:45:56,121 --> 00:45:58,817
Don't hold a grudge against your father.

525
00:45:59,357 --> 00:46:02,758
He's getting old
and just as confused as I am.

526
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:08,089
But I know that in his heart,
he's extremely proud of you.

527
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:11,759
Just look at him.

528
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:16,665
He keeps all of his feelings and emotions
bottled up inside him.

529
00:46:17,475 --> 00:46:21,241
Someday,
he'll have to express himself to you...

530
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,440
...or he'll end up in a hospital
with something...

531
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:29,751
...worse than an upset stomach.

532
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,098
There's 10 yuan in change.
Why didn't you ask for it?

533
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,432
We're lucky he got us here
through the traffic in the rain!

534
00:46:52,544 --> 00:46:56,708
The meter was running! If there's money
to be made, they'll make it!

535
00:46:57,382 --> 00:47:00,044
Tell him to get out
and help with the luggage!

536
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:03,314
They're supposed to carry
the luggage for tips!

537
00:47:03,421 --> 00:47:06,413
Just like your sister,
you throw out tips like water.

538
00:47:06,524 --> 00:47:09,960
But how much does your sister make
compared to you?

539
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:12,390
Let's go.

540
00:47:13,031 --> 00:47:16,125
You're all alone now.
Save as much as you can.

541
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:18,827
Who are you gonna depend on
when you get old?

542
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:22,133
I'll be depending on whomever
you're depending on!

543
00:47:24,576 --> 00:47:26,271
What? No elevator?

544
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,549
He hasn't come by in a week.
He didn't even call me.

545
00:47:40,792 --> 00:47:42,657
Maybe he's busy with exams.

546
00:47:43,061 --> 00:47:46,724
Weren't you ignoring him?
Didn't you want to break up with him?

547
00:47:46,898 --> 00:47:49,890
No. I was just playing hard to get.

548
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:51,899
I love him, you know.

549
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:55,071
I think I really love him.

550
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:57,873
That's strange. Is it because...

551
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:02,271
Why is he ignoring me all of a sudden?

552
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,443
What should I do?

553
00:48:06,451 --> 00:48:09,215
You honestly think we can
pull that many out of Sydney?

554
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,447
Why not Bangkok? Or Osaka?

555
00:48:11,923 --> 00:48:15,916
I showed you the projections yesterday.
Do you still have questions?

556
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,425
That's right.

557
00:48:18,463 --> 00:48:19,794
Sorry.

558
00:48:19,931 --> 00:48:23,924
I'm not used to working with someone
who's not a certifiable idiot.

559
00:48:24,535 --> 00:48:26,935
Or maybe you're a little too smug?

560
00:48:27,171 --> 00:48:29,901
Probably, but you know what I mean.

561
00:48:30,008 --> 00:48:32,476
Maybe it's because
I sometimes get a flash...

562
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:35,273
...about how meaningless all this crap is.

563
00:48:35,713 --> 00:48:37,647
Or maybe I'm just tired.

564
00:48:39,517 --> 00:48:42,350
- You want some tea?
- I want liquor.

565
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:46,681
I sense a bottle of scotch in the vicinity.

566
00:49:14,152 --> 00:49:16,712
- How did you know?
- Educated guess.

567
00:49:17,355 --> 00:49:19,915
I figured you spend so much time in here.

568
00:49:20,024 --> 00:49:22,720
Am I really that much of an old maid?

569
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:24,989
No, far from it!

570
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,622
You remind me of when I was a student.

571
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:32,031
The smartest were often the wildest.

572
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:36,136
We used to make liquor in chemistry lab
and hide it behind the blackboard.

573
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,673
So you were a chemist?

574
00:49:39,043 --> 00:49:42,171
That's what I studied to be
in a prior lifetime.

575
00:49:44,449 --> 00:49:47,612
- Then why this?
- Business? The airline business?

576
00:49:48,853 --> 00:49:52,084
- The same way you did.
- Well, I didn't really plan this.

577
00:49:52,557 --> 00:49:53,751
Exactly.

578
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:57,617
To your health.

579
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:10,732
Why did the two of you
turn in your homework so late?

580
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:13,400
Take a look at your work.
Practically identical.

581
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,274
I better not see this again.

582
00:50:22,754 --> 00:50:25,518
You appeared like May sunshine
with your rose smile

583
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:27,215
Spreading love and warmth

584
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:11,301
Torturing yourself again?

585
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,431
Actually, I'm waiting for you.

586
00:51:57,181 --> 00:52:00,275
- Do you live here?
- Nobody lives here. I just sleep here.

587
00:52:00,384 --> 00:52:03,512
- Your parents?
- In China, eyeing real estate deals.

588
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:06,317
They stop by once in a while
to check up on the place.

589
00:52:06,424 --> 00:52:07,652
Busy making money.

590
00:52:07,758 --> 00:52:09,851
- Do they stay downstairs?
- No.

591
00:52:10,094 --> 00:52:12,995
Just a tenant downstairs.
My grandma used to live there...

592
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:16,066
...but since her stroke,
my parents put her in a nursing home.

593
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,169
- Would you like something to drink?
- Some ice water.

594
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:46,958
Ice water.

595
00:52:52,303 --> 00:52:54,066
It's very quiet here.

596
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,996
- Do you want to hear some music?
- No.

597
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,275
- Are these yours?
- Yeah.

598
00:53:01,746 --> 00:53:04,146
I didn't know you were into photography.

599
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:08,309
Not really, I only take pictures
of my grandmother. I visit her every week.

600
00:53:08,452 --> 00:53:11,546
The camera seems to be
the only thing she responds to...

601
00:53:11,656 --> 00:53:13,123
...you know...

602
00:53:14,425 --> 00:53:16,017
...with her eyes.

603
00:53:16,427 --> 00:53:18,122
Probably the flash.

604
00:53:18,596 --> 00:53:20,154
She can't talk?

605
00:53:21,299 --> 00:53:23,995
Maybe she doesn't want
to be photographed.

606
00:53:24,335 --> 00:53:26,701
I had the same thought but...

607
00:53:34,912 --> 00:53:36,504
Here she comes.

608
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:31,163
I'm on the 10th floor.
There is a window view overlooking Taipei.

609
00:54:33,738 --> 00:54:36,400
- Why can't we go in?
- It must be dangerous.

610
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:39,733
Oh, no! It's a big fraud.

611
00:54:40,378 --> 00:54:43,040
The police shut it down.

612
00:54:44,081 --> 00:54:47,676
- What do you mean?
- This land is a toxic waste dump.

613
00:54:48,085 --> 00:54:51,612
Can't you smell the poison?

614
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,721
I don't smell a thing.

615
00:54:55,092 --> 00:54:59,324
Hope you weren't one of the suckers
who bought it. The company's bankrupt!

616
00:54:59,697 --> 00:55:02,165
The company took the money and ran.

617
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:21,182
I told you you should have invested in art.

618
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,147
Sorry. Bad joke.

619
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:26,748
Just wanted to cheer you up.

620
00:55:27,591 --> 00:55:30,082
If you don't want to stay at home...

621
00:55:31,362 --> 00:55:33,387
...I can help you find a place.

622
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:37,400
You all right?

623
00:55:37,902 --> 00:55:40,462
Oddly, I feel light and free.

624
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:44,867
- Free enough to fly to Amsterdam!
- Exactly.

625
00:55:56,087 --> 00:55:57,952
Where is Mr. Wen in Room 22?

626
00:55:58,055 --> 00:56:01,616
He checked out this morning
against his doctor's advice.

627
00:56:01,726 --> 00:56:04,923
- Are you his relative?
- He's my father's associate.

628
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:25,505
Miss, which way is the elevator?

629
00:56:25,616 --> 00:56:28,210
- Straight down, turn left.
- Thanks.

630
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:40,124
This way.

631
00:57:02,566 --> 00:57:03,863
Excuse me.

632
00:57:14,478 --> 00:57:18,676
<i>Paging Cardiovascular, Dr. Wang Tze-Chen,
please report to room...</i>

633
00:57:19,917 --> 00:57:21,544
- Sorry.
- May I help you?

634
00:57:21,685 --> 00:57:24,119
- What department is this?
- Cardiovascular.

635
00:57:24,221 --> 00:57:25,518
Thank you.

636
00:58:22,112 --> 00:58:23,340
Jia-Ning?

637
00:58:25,916 --> 00:58:27,941
Wake up, sleepyhead.

638
00:58:41,732 --> 00:58:42,721
Morning.

639
00:58:44,001 --> 00:58:45,468
Morning, Dad.

640
00:59:32,649 --> 00:59:34,014
Thanks, Dad.

641
00:59:41,158 --> 00:59:44,559
Dad forgot to add the shrimp paste
in the flat mushroom.

642
00:59:53,403 --> 00:59:55,030
Mrs. Liang is back.

643
00:59:55,539 --> 00:59:59,066
She repeatedly tells Jin-Rong
what happened in America...

644
00:59:59,376 --> 01:00:00,809
...driving her crazy.

645
01:00:00,911 --> 01:00:04,312
Shan-Shan said Mrs. Liang's cooking
is worse than her mother's.

646
01:00:08,585 --> 01:00:10,849
I have an announcement to make.

647
01:00:11,788 --> 01:00:14,882
It's about my work.
Lately, my company is...

648
01:00:15,258 --> 01:00:19,354
You don't need to tell us. We read
about your apartment in the paper.

649
01:00:19,463 --> 01:00:21,294
What are you going to do?

650
01:00:21,598 --> 01:00:23,691
Can't you get your money back?

651
01:00:24,501 --> 01:00:27,937
Did you put all of your savings
in that apartment?

652
01:00:29,172 --> 01:00:30,469
Of course...

653
01:00:32,576 --> 01:00:34,942
...you may continue to live here.

654
01:00:49,926 --> 01:00:52,156
Your t-shirts were in my closet.

655
01:00:52,262 --> 01:00:55,527
These are yours.
He should let us sort our own clothes.

656
01:00:56,199 --> 01:00:58,030
He seems preoccupied lately.

657
01:00:58,135 --> 01:01:01,161
Exactly. Would I wear
old-fashioned underwear like these?

658
01:01:01,271 --> 01:01:03,068
Did my underwear offend you?

659
01:01:03,173 --> 01:01:05,937
- You know what I mean.
- I'm afraid I don't.

660
01:01:17,054 --> 01:01:19,818
- Dad, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

661
01:01:24,394 --> 01:01:27,227
- Why did you ask?
- No, it's just that...

662
01:01:28,298 --> 01:01:30,425
- Do I look bad?
- No...

663
01:01:34,204 --> 01:01:35,432
I'm fine!

664
01:01:48,552 --> 01:01:51,783
- Grandpa Chu!
- Shan-Shan, Jin-Rong, come in!

665
01:01:54,324 --> 01:01:58,090
I should have come sooner
to visit and thank you in person.

666
01:01:58,361 --> 01:02:02,821
Jin-Rong is too busy to bring me over.
I almost had to force her to take me.

667
01:02:03,033 --> 01:02:06,491
She said that you and your whole family
really took care of them.

668
01:02:06,603 --> 01:02:10,539
It's only my duty. Jia-Jen and Jin-Feng
were good classmates.

669
01:02:12,042 --> 01:02:15,068
You took care of my daughter
when she was in Tainan.

670
01:02:15,178 --> 01:02:17,840
Now that Jin-Rong is alone in Taipei...

671
01:02:17,948 --> 01:02:20,473
- Shan-Shan!
- Little Aunt, can we draw?

672
01:02:20,717 --> 01:02:22,378
- For Uncle Chu.
- Thanks, but...

673
01:02:22,519 --> 01:02:25,716
- Jia-Jen, it's been so long.
- Mrs. Liang!

674
01:02:25,822 --> 01:02:28,188
- Still teaching at the same school?
- Yes.

675
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:30,384
- Still not married?
- Yes.

676
01:02:30,961 --> 01:02:33,953
Frankly, marriage is quite meaningless.

677
01:02:34,364 --> 01:02:38,061
A bad marriage is such a burden.
You might as well get a divorce.

678
01:02:38,168 --> 01:02:41,968
You have to be insane to marry
such a loser, like Jin-Rong's husband.

679
01:02:42,372 --> 01:02:45,068
It's like a tired dog
dragging some broken cart.

680
01:02:45,242 --> 01:02:47,802
And in the end, you're left all alone.

681
01:02:47,911 --> 01:02:49,936
- Isn't that so, Mr. Chu?
- Yes.

682
01:02:50,046 --> 01:02:53,482
- Ma, why do you have to say that?
- But it's true!

683
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:56,017
- Prepare some fruit, Jia-Jen.
- Okay.

684
01:02:56,353 --> 01:02:58,480
- Your second daughter?
- The youngest.

685
01:02:58,622 --> 01:03:01,056
- Hello, Mrs. Liang.
- How old are you?

686
01:03:01,358 --> 01:03:03,986
- Twenty.
- It's time to have a boyfriend.

687
01:03:04,094 --> 01:03:06,790
Don't wait too long like your older sister.

688
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:10,093
- Let's sit down.
- Let me make some tea.

689
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:12,325
- Can we draw now?
- All right.

690
01:03:14,037 --> 01:03:15,698
- Mrs. Liang.
- You are?

691
01:03:15,939 --> 01:03:17,804
- Jia-Chien.
- That's right.

692
01:03:17,908 --> 01:03:19,535
You're No. 2.

693
01:03:19,643 --> 01:03:21,838
- Aren't you pretty?
- Thank you.

694
01:03:22,179 --> 01:03:26,206
- Are you used to Taipei yet?
- It's okay. Good to be home.

695
01:03:26,716 --> 01:03:29,617
Do you have a boyfriend?
I'm sure you have several.

696
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,951
Keep your options open.

697
01:03:32,055 --> 01:03:36,082
Don't listen to what men say,
but watch their actions. Understood?

698
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,951
Isn't that right, Mr. Chu?

699
01:03:41,164 --> 01:03:44,327
- Your daughters aren't bad.
- Your daughters are fine, too.

700
01:03:44,434 --> 01:03:46,402
Mine are no good.

701
01:03:46,503 --> 01:03:50,462
My oldest is in the middle of
this nasty divorce.

702
01:03:50,574 --> 01:03:54,908
Her husband was so sordid.
He fools around with several other women.

703
01:03:55,245 --> 01:03:57,372
I can't even mention the details.

704
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:00,745
And there's my youngest
with her white husband...

705
01:04:01,051 --> 01:04:03,918
...who plays electric guitar
in the garage all weekend.

706
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:06,250
He eats hamburgers with onions every day.

707
01:04:06,356 --> 01:04:09,086
And when I fry rice,
the smoke alarm goes off!

708
01:04:09,259 --> 01:04:12,558
I tell you,
it was like a living hell there for me.

709
01:04:12,929 --> 01:04:16,831
- Mr. Chu, I'm sure you don't mind, do you?
- Of course not. Please.

710
01:04:18,268 --> 01:04:19,565
Old witch.

711
01:04:25,675 --> 01:04:27,233
A breeze blows in...

712
01:04:29,079 --> 01:04:31,946
...fluttering through your clothes,
across your smile.

713
01:04:46,263 --> 01:04:50,029
In a dreamy garret,
I am keeping my late autumn love for you.

714
01:04:53,003 --> 01:04:54,903
"Late autumn love..."

715
01:05:45,221 --> 01:05:48,122
<i>"So many times,
I want to say 'I love you'</i>

716
01:05:49,292 --> 01:05:52,284
<i>"So often,
I want to say 'I'm sorry'</i>

717
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:58,492
<i>"You cried, 'This is fate. It's over'</i>

718
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:02,795
<i>"It's over"</i>

719
01:06:07,077 --> 01:06:08,874
How are you, Teacher?

720
01:06:08,979 --> 01:06:11,607
<i>"But give me just one moment</i>

721
01:06:11,715 --> 01:06:14,013
<i>"One more look</i>

722
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:16,584
<i>"Don't take everything away</i>

723
01:06:16,886 --> 01:06:19,184
<i>"Another chance</i>

724
01:06:19,289 --> 01:06:21,757
<i>"A little tenderness</i>

725
01:06:22,292 --> 01:06:25,420
<i>"Don't let me hurt so bad</i>

726
01:06:35,905 --> 01:06:39,306
<i>"You can make me happy</i>

727
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:43,236
<i>"Make me sad</i>

728
01:06:44,481 --> 01:06:49,350
<i>"Make me willing to give you...</i>

729
01:06:52,088 --> 01:06:54,215
<i>"...everything"</i>

730
01:07:02,399 --> 01:07:04,731
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

731
01:07:05,869 --> 01:07:08,463
<i>I'm new here,
so I'm not familiar with everyone.</i>

732
01:07:08,571 --> 01:07:10,971
<i>So I nominate Teacher Chu for a song.</i>

733
01:07:15,678 --> 01:07:16,975
Be careful.

734
01:07:20,517 --> 01:07:22,314
Teacher, what do you want to sing?

735
01:07:22,452 --> 01:07:25,444
<i>That won't be necessary.
I'll sing Love's Commandments.</i>

736
01:07:27,991 --> 01:07:32,223
<i>"Love is forever, patient, and kind</i>

737
01:07:33,163 --> 01:07:36,189
<i>"Love isn't jealous</i>

738
01:07:38,101 --> 01:07:42,162
<i>"Love isn't boastful or crazy</i>

739
01:07:42,972 --> 01:07:46,135
<i>"Love doesn't do shameful things"</i>

740
01:07:55,585 --> 01:07:57,917
A soprano! You have a great voice.

741
01:07:58,021 --> 01:08:00,615
- You, too.
- I wanted to ask you a question.

742
01:08:00,924 --> 01:08:02,858
Are you free this Sunday?

743
01:08:03,927 --> 01:08:07,795
I'm taking the volleyball team on an outing.
Do you want to come?

744
01:08:08,131 --> 01:08:10,998
- An outing?
- You should get some sun.

745
01:08:11,501 --> 01:08:13,969
Join us if you've got nothing else to do.

746
01:08:14,471 --> 01:08:16,996
Think about it, and let me know. Bye!

747
01:08:47,937 --> 01:08:51,202
Don't crowd me! Be quiet!

748
01:08:51,941 --> 01:08:54,637
- What do you want?
- Curried beef and rice.

749
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:59,171
- And you?
- Fried rice with eggs.

750
01:08:59,282 --> 01:09:02,945
It's too easy for Grandpa Chu.
He won't do it. Something more difficult.

751
01:09:05,388 --> 01:09:08,619
Here is Mom's lunch box
and tomorrow's menu.

752
01:09:09,559 --> 01:09:10,583
Bye.

753
01:09:28,678 --> 01:09:32,637
You're right. The Sydney route
is worth half as much as they're asking.

754
01:09:32,749 --> 01:09:36,185
To think that the Chief
was going to offer $30 million.

755
01:09:45,595 --> 01:09:48,689
Great. This is why
you get paid the big bucks.

756
01:09:49,098 --> 01:09:52,295
- No wonder you're so tired all the time.
- You should try it.

757
01:09:52,402 --> 01:09:55,963
In one morning, I've already killed
2,000 aliens and saved the world.

758
01:09:56,072 --> 01:09:59,473
- What did you accomplish this morning?
- A small headache.

759
01:09:59,909 --> 01:10:02,537
How could you kill those cute aliens?

760
01:10:06,883 --> 01:10:08,874
I remember now. Forget it.

761
01:10:09,619 --> 01:10:12,986
- You have time to give me a hand?
- Sure.

762
01:10:16,125 --> 01:10:18,855
I always wanted to find
something Chinese for him.

763
01:10:18,962 --> 01:10:20,827
He has plenty of these already.

764
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:23,558
- He's interested in Chinese culture?
- I wish.

765
01:10:23,666 --> 01:10:28,035
I can't believe that in a few years,
my son is growing up to be an American.

766
01:10:28,137 --> 01:10:31,402
Sometimes I look at him
and wonder if he's actually my son.

767
01:10:31,507 --> 01:10:34,135
He was raised in America,
and his mother doesn't mind.

768
01:10:34,244 --> 01:10:37,475
His mother? How does she feel
about you being away all the time?

769
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:39,571
She's glad I'm not around.

770
01:10:39,916 --> 01:10:42,851
I think the only reason we're not divorced...

771
01:10:43,386 --> 01:10:46,184
...is that we're both too busy.

772
01:10:47,156 --> 01:10:49,090
That sounds so cynical, doesn't it?

773
01:10:49,192 --> 01:10:52,628
I'm just as cynical
when it comes to my personal life.

774
01:10:54,364 --> 01:10:57,856
- Sometimes I wish I could just...
- Pick up and fly away.

775
01:10:58,368 --> 01:11:01,496
Seems like that's what
you'll be doing pretty soon.

776
01:11:01,604 --> 01:11:04,095
I thought that was the answer, too.

777
01:11:04,707 --> 01:11:08,541
As a result, I really messed things up
after I graduated from Chen-Kong.

778
01:11:08,645 --> 01:11:10,875
- Chen-Kong University?
- Yeah.

779
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:15,016
After graduation, my old man had a post
for me in his chemical business.

780
01:11:15,151 --> 01:11:17,051
- Chemical?
- That's right.

781
01:11:17,253 --> 01:11:19,346
Remember the whiskey lab?

782
01:11:19,856 --> 01:11:23,223
I actually enjoyed it as a subject.
It's the chaos in my life.

783
01:11:23,326 --> 01:11:26,989
There was a lot of pressure
from my parents, my girlfriend.

784
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:29,955
I guess I didn't have the courage. So I left.

785
01:11:30,066 --> 01:11:32,091
Then you went to the U.S.?

786
01:11:33,169 --> 01:11:37,196
It wasn't great, but it was better
for everyone in the long run.

787
01:11:42,845 --> 01:11:44,073
You okay?

788
01:11:46,416 --> 01:11:49,385
- This looks Chinese.
- That's Harvey.

789
01:11:49,719 --> 01:11:53,416
You have no idea how much I suffered
from those kids' shows.

790
01:11:53,956 --> 01:11:55,651
Wanna hear the theme?

791
01:11:55,958 --> 01:11:57,858
- "I love..."
- Please don't.

792
01:11:58,695 --> 01:12:01,960
What the hell, I'll just buy this one.
He'll like it.

793
01:12:19,649 --> 01:12:20,911
Uncle Chu!

794
01:12:21,884 --> 01:12:25,320
Jin-Rong, what's wrong?
Is it the detective?

795
01:12:26,122 --> 01:12:30,081
No. Shan-Shan is not feeling well.
She won't be going to school.

796
01:12:30,727 --> 01:12:32,024
So you...?

797
01:12:32,295 --> 01:12:35,731
I was wondering why her lunch box
was always so clean.

798
01:12:35,998 --> 01:12:39,126
No one could ever finish
all my short ribs before!

799
01:12:39,702 --> 01:12:42,170
- Hope you don't mind.
- Of course not.

800
01:12:42,505 --> 01:12:45,531
But what about the lunches
I'd prepared for her?

801
01:12:45,641 --> 01:12:48,303
I ate them myself, down to the last bite.

802
01:12:49,178 --> 01:12:52,841
How embarrassing.
A master chef like you, eating my lunches.

803
01:12:52,949 --> 01:12:54,644
I was more than happy to.

804
01:12:54,751 --> 01:12:58,847
Besides, I lost my sense of taste,
so it's the feeling that counts.

805
01:13:00,757 --> 01:13:02,725
All right. I should go now.

806
01:13:03,226 --> 01:13:05,694
Don't tell Shan-Shan
that I know about this.

807
01:13:05,828 --> 01:13:09,662
- She'd like a little secret between you two.
- Yes, I understand.

808
01:13:09,899 --> 01:13:10,888
Bye.

809
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:21,536
I loved him so much.

810
01:13:22,545 --> 01:13:24,877
How could he do this to me?

811
01:13:26,048 --> 01:13:28,039
You hardly cared for him.

812
01:13:28,551 --> 01:13:30,485
I was only pretending...

813
01:13:31,154 --> 01:13:34,180
...because my love for him was so strong!

814
01:13:34,524 --> 01:13:38,221
I was scared of its intensity.
I feel humiliated!

815
01:13:38,327 --> 01:13:40,420
I went to see him, and he...

816
01:13:41,431 --> 01:13:43,524
I don't want to live anymore.

817
01:13:45,902 --> 01:13:48,564
If I only knew, then I wouldn't have...

818
01:13:49,272 --> 01:13:51,035
I thought you two...

819
01:13:58,748 --> 01:14:00,113
Chu Jia-Ning.

820
01:14:02,552 --> 01:14:03,712
You...

821
01:14:05,021 --> 01:14:06,352
You two...

822
01:14:19,569 --> 01:14:21,264
Dad, do you need any help?

823
01:14:21,370 --> 01:14:23,497
Call your sisters to dinner.

824
01:14:25,308 --> 01:14:26,468
Dad...

825
01:14:28,611 --> 01:14:29,635
Go.

826
01:14:47,296 --> 01:14:50,663
Can't they stop for once? It's so annoying.

827
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:55,093
We communicate by eating.
So what's wrong with singing karaoke?

828
01:15:06,549 --> 01:15:08,813
I have an announcement to make.

829
01:15:10,486 --> 01:15:12,681
I know it sounds incredible...

830
01:15:12,989 --> 01:15:15,389
...but a lot of times
things happen this way.

831
01:15:15,491 --> 01:15:17,459
Which class did you fail?

832
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:20,187
I met a boy. A man.

833
01:15:20,696 --> 01:15:23,028
We're in love. We plan to live together.

834
01:15:23,132 --> 01:15:26,260
His family has a huge apartment,
and his parents will like me.

835
01:15:26,369 --> 01:15:29,668
So I plan on moving in with them.
But the main reason is...

836
01:15:30,439 --> 01:15:32,304
...I'm having his baby.

837
01:15:50,626 --> 01:15:52,025
Bye, Dad.

838
01:16:22,858 --> 01:16:24,325
That Jia-Ning.

839
01:16:24,927 --> 01:16:27,122
I'm still in a state of shock.

840
01:16:30,199 --> 01:16:32,759
Do you think Dad's okay? Where'd he go?

841
01:16:33,269 --> 01:16:35,737
He's probably chatting with Mrs. Liang.

842
01:16:35,871 --> 01:16:39,170
Don't worry about him.
Take off to Amsterdam.

843
01:16:39,609 --> 01:16:41,736
Just do what you have to do.

844
01:16:45,948 --> 01:16:48,314
Go ahead. I really meant it.

845
01:16:51,187 --> 01:16:55,988
Sis, do you ever think about what
might have been if you had stayed with...

846
01:16:57,693 --> 01:16:59,593
...what's his name again?

847
01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:01,956
Li Kai.

848
01:17:02,431 --> 01:17:05,923
Had you left to the US
with Li Kai after graduation...

849
01:17:06,202 --> 01:17:08,193
...what things might have been like?

850
01:17:08,337 --> 01:17:09,998
Why are you asking?

851
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:14,141
- Your life could've been different.
- What's wrong with my life now?

852
01:17:14,243 --> 01:17:16,507
Do you want to be stuck here forever?

853
01:17:16,612 --> 01:17:19,206
- What if I told you I saw...
- That's enough.

854
01:17:19,382 --> 01:17:21,179
This is my home, and it's fine.

855
01:17:21,283 --> 01:17:24,844
"This is my home, and it's fine,"
but it isn't everything!

856
01:17:25,388 --> 01:17:29,256
But it's Dad's everything!
I know him far better than you do!

857
01:17:33,596 --> 01:17:36,690
Why is it that you feel
that you have to meddle in my life?

858
01:17:36,832 --> 01:17:39,960
What gives you the right
to tell me what to feel?

859
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:42,103
That's right...

860
01:17:42,838 --> 01:17:45,306
...my heart was broken by Li Kai.

861
01:17:47,143 --> 01:17:51,170
And you probably think that I'm pathetic
for never getting over it.

862
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,544
But at least I had a heart to break.

863
01:17:53,749 --> 01:17:55,614
I don't need your pity.

864
01:17:57,186 --> 01:17:59,484
And what do you know of my heart?

865
01:18:00,656 --> 01:18:02,283
Nothing whatsoever...

866
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:07,027
...because you never felt that
I was worth sharing your feelings with.

867
01:18:07,163 --> 01:18:08,289
You're wrong.

868
01:18:08,431 --> 01:18:12,367
Ever since Mom died,
you acted more like a parent than a sister.

869
01:18:13,135 --> 01:18:14,659
You shut me out.

870
01:18:23,279 --> 01:18:24,906
I thought you hated me.

871
01:18:27,316 --> 01:18:28,442
Never.

872
01:18:35,725 --> 01:18:37,352
I broke the plate.

873
01:18:39,261 --> 01:18:40,523
It's okay.

874
01:18:56,912 --> 01:18:58,903
<i>Hi, if it's Bo-Kang, stop calling me.</i>

875
01:18:59,048 --> 01:19:01,846
<i>If it's Mom,
get Dad to drink the healthy tea.</i>

876
01:19:01,951 --> 01:19:05,318
<i>Everyone else, please leave a message.
Okay, leave a message.</i>

877
01:19:06,388 --> 01:19:09,414
Hi, Grace. Please call me
when you hear this message.

878
01:19:09,525 --> 01:19:11,493
Nothing really urgent, but...

879
01:19:11,827 --> 01:19:13,317
...we haven't spoken...

880
01:19:13,462 --> 01:19:16,454
- Congratulations, Vice-President!
- Congratulations!

881
01:19:16,632 --> 01:19:18,759
Your promotion is official!

882
01:19:20,770 --> 01:19:23,136
My family's from the Hunan Province.

883
01:19:23,239 --> 01:19:26,470
After the war,
my husband and I moved to Shanghai.

884
01:19:26,575 --> 01:19:31,069
There was a Tong De girls' school
in Shanghai. We lived behind that alley.

885
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:33,614
My husband also loved to cook.

886
01:19:33,883 --> 01:19:36,078
He was just very unlucky.

887
01:19:36,285 --> 01:19:39,277
After we came to Taiwan,
he got stomach cancer and passed away.

888
01:19:43,392 --> 01:19:46,953
I also had to fight tooth and nail
to bring up my children alone.

889
01:19:47,096 --> 01:19:48,757
It's not easy, Mr. Chu.

890
01:19:48,898 --> 01:19:52,595
And look at them now.
Their wings grow stronger and stronger.

891
01:19:52,701 --> 01:19:54,168
They do as they please.

892
01:19:54,303 --> 01:19:57,397
They could care less about you.
It's so not worth it.

893
01:20:11,554 --> 01:20:12,851
That's it.

894
01:20:14,056 --> 01:20:16,684
I'll translate it first thing tomorrow.

895
01:20:17,059 --> 01:20:19,391
And then you're off to negotiate?

896
01:20:19,862 --> 01:20:21,557
Probably in a couple of weeks.

897
01:20:21,697 --> 01:20:25,861
I'll be in the States for a few days,
then here, and finally to Sydney.

898
01:20:26,235 --> 01:20:29,602
I requested that you take
a few days off to come with me.

899
01:20:29,905 --> 01:20:31,395
I'll need you.

900
01:20:31,774 --> 01:20:33,799
You'll do fine by yourself.

901
01:20:34,009 --> 01:20:36,705
Frankly, with your promotion now...

902
01:20:37,279 --> 01:20:39,304
...it's really your decision.

903
01:20:39,415 --> 01:20:42,350
You're my boss, technically speaking.

904
01:20:42,818 --> 01:20:44,979
Wrong. I am your boss, period.

905
01:20:45,855 --> 01:20:47,686
Yes, "boss."

906
01:21:15,651 --> 01:21:16,982
What is it?

907
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:20,718
- Don't you know who I am?
- No.

908
01:21:21,891 --> 01:21:25,691
- Call me Chu Jia-Chien.
- Okay, whatever you like.

909
01:21:26,695 --> 01:21:29,163
Call me Chu Jia-Chien!

910
01:21:39,275 --> 01:21:42,438
Have you completely erased
my older sister from your memory?

911
01:21:42,544 --> 01:21:43,909
Your older sister?

912
01:21:44,113 --> 01:21:46,581
That's right. My older sister.

913
01:21:47,983 --> 01:21:50,247
Chu Jia-Jen is my older sister.

914
01:21:50,686 --> 01:21:54,315
It's only been nine years
since your romance with her in college.

915
01:21:54,423 --> 01:21:57,654
She's still living in the past
and refusing to marry another!

916
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,695
- You've completely forgotten her!
- Chu Jia-Jen?

917
01:22:00,829 --> 01:22:02,421
Now you remember?

918
01:22:03,399 --> 01:22:07,062
I don't remember this person,
but I've heard that name before.

919
01:22:07,269 --> 01:22:08,600
"Heard"?

920
01:22:10,472 --> 01:22:12,497
But I really can't remember.

921
01:22:13,409 --> 01:22:15,138
Are you just pretending?

922
01:22:15,244 --> 01:22:17,872
If you feel embarrassed, then forget it.

923
01:22:18,047 --> 01:22:20,277
There must be
some sort of misunderstanding.

924
01:22:20,382 --> 01:22:24,478
I wouldn't deny it if I really knew her,
whether she was your sister or not.

925
01:22:24,586 --> 01:22:28,022
- I need more information.
- The Chemistry Department at Chen-Kong.

926
01:22:28,123 --> 01:22:30,591
- What else do you need?
- That's impossible.

927
01:22:30,693 --> 01:22:34,185
There weren't many female students
in the Chemistry Department.

928
01:22:34,330 --> 01:22:37,356
- What's she like?
- She was your girlfriend!

929
01:22:37,499 --> 01:22:40,935
She gave you her first kiss!
I don't know what else to tell you!

930
01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:43,402
No, she wasn't my girlfriend.

931
01:22:44,807 --> 01:22:47,605
She wasn't even in my class. Now I recall.

932
01:22:48,577 --> 01:22:51,569
We were in the same department,
but not the same class.

933
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:53,671
I think she hung out with Jin-Feng.

934
01:22:53,782 --> 01:22:55,409
You know Jin-Feng?

935
01:22:56,085 --> 01:22:59,452
She was my girlfriend!
We broke up after graduation.

936
01:23:00,222 --> 01:23:03,191
She married an American guy
before I left for the States.

937
01:23:03,292 --> 01:23:05,783
I saw her once in Chicago last year.

938
01:23:06,261 --> 01:23:07,694
Now I know.

939
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:12,726
She often spoke of her best friend.
That must have been Chu Jia-Jen.

940
01:23:14,169 --> 01:23:15,796
Are you all right?

941
01:23:16,171 --> 01:23:19,106
You mean, she made it all up!

942
01:23:19,908 --> 01:23:22,433
- You're lying.
- Why would I lie to you?

943
01:23:24,213 --> 01:23:26,044
How did this happen?

944
01:23:26,148 --> 01:23:28,241
She made the whole story up.

945
01:23:36,792 --> 01:23:38,282
Please be home.

946
01:23:40,529 --> 01:23:42,622
Raymond, so glad you're home.

947
01:23:42,765 --> 01:23:45,962
- I just heard an absurd story.
- Raymond, who is it?

948
01:23:46,201 --> 01:23:47,532
No one!

949
01:23:50,873 --> 01:23:52,431
I'm in a little...

950
01:23:53,308 --> 01:23:55,037
Oh, I understand.

951
01:23:56,278 --> 01:23:58,143
I'll call you tomorrow.

952
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:09,018
Welcome back, Chef Wen!

953
01:24:13,796 --> 01:24:16,492
Stop kissing up. Back to work, you fools!

954
01:24:17,866 --> 01:24:19,834
- Chef Wen...
- Just a second!

955
01:24:41,924 --> 01:24:43,152
Chef Wen?

956
01:25:06,415 --> 01:25:08,144
Where have you been?

957
01:25:12,454 --> 01:25:14,479
Uncle Wen passed away.

958
01:25:43,418 --> 01:25:45,113
B, South, 7204.

959
01:25:47,089 --> 01:25:48,886
Should be around here.

960
01:26:44,646 --> 01:26:46,238
I don't want tea.

961
01:26:46,915 --> 01:26:48,348
I want water.

962
01:26:48,984 --> 01:26:53,080
Drink it, Dad. It's your favorite
mountain tea. You'll feel better.

963
01:26:53,422 --> 01:26:55,287
My taste buds are gone.

964
01:26:55,824 --> 01:26:57,314
I prefer water.

965
01:28:41,997 --> 01:28:44,158
Why is she dressed like that?

966
01:28:47,736 --> 01:28:49,829
I love you, Teacher Chu!

967
01:29:44,092 --> 01:29:45,957
<i>Can a single hand clap?</i>

968
01:29:46,361 --> 01:29:48,591
<i>Even a ballplayer needs an opponent!</i>

969
01:29:48,730 --> 01:29:51,790
<i>Why do I only get to talk
to thin air about love?</i>

970
01:29:52,334 --> 01:29:56,327
<i>Who's been writing these letters to me?
If you have guts, step up!</i>

971
01:29:56,805 --> 01:30:00,536
<i>Who's been putting disgusting letters
on my desk every day? Who?</i>

972
01:30:01,576 --> 01:30:03,908
<i>Why hide if you had the guts
to write them?</i>

973
01:30:04,212 --> 01:30:05,736
<i>I'm not gonna let this go!</i>

974
01:30:05,847 --> 01:30:08,543
<i>I'll post the letters
to check the handwriting!</i>

975
01:30:08,650 --> 01:30:11,676
<i>I'll see where you can hide!
Go ahead and hide!</i>

976
01:30:26,568 --> 01:30:28,035
What happened?

977
01:30:28,703 --> 01:30:32,139
Teacher said she'd forgive us
for writing the letters.

978
01:30:35,377 --> 01:30:37,538
You guys really went too far.

979
01:30:50,292 --> 01:30:52,886
The outing has been changed to next week.

980
01:30:52,994 --> 01:30:54,689
Will you be coming?

981
01:30:55,230 --> 01:30:57,858
Here's what I'll do, I'll sign you up for now.

982
01:30:57,999 --> 01:31:00,695
If you're busy, then let me know later.

983
01:31:08,877 --> 01:31:12,404
I'm sorry those jerks
hurt your feelings this way.

984
01:31:37,973 --> 01:31:40,237
I'm sorry about the other night.

985
01:31:40,342 --> 01:31:42,606
It was just a really confusing experience.

986
01:31:42,711 --> 01:31:46,545
My mind was blank. Besides you,
I didn't know where else to go.

987
01:31:46,715 --> 01:31:49,775
It's all right.
I should be the one apologizing.

988
01:31:49,885 --> 01:31:52,319
Why should you be sorry? It's your life.

989
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:55,753
In any case,
I've made some decisions about my future.

990
01:31:56,124 --> 01:32:00,083
I want to go someplace where
no one knows me to get a fresh start.

991
01:32:00,362 --> 01:32:02,887
I knew you could take care of yourself.

992
01:32:03,064 --> 01:32:05,931
I also have a decision to announce
about my future.

993
01:32:06,034 --> 01:32:07,524
What decision?

994
01:32:08,336 --> 01:32:11,100
You know I'm not the type to settle down.

995
01:32:11,973 --> 01:32:16,103
I'm still not sure about this.
Nevertheless, it's been...

996
01:32:17,045 --> 01:32:18,637
Remember Sophia?

997
01:32:20,048 --> 01:32:23,449
No? I'm sure I've mentioned her name
to you a few times.

998
01:32:23,685 --> 01:32:26,654
Nothing serious in the beginning, until...

999
01:32:26,755 --> 01:32:28,620
You're getting married?

1000
01:32:30,258 --> 01:32:34,194
I would have told you about it sooner,
but it was all so sudden.

1001
01:32:34,729 --> 01:32:36,890
She's really changed my life.

1002
01:32:37,032 --> 01:32:39,432
Maybe she'll also change my future.

1003
01:32:40,201 --> 01:32:42,669
It sounds more absurd than your story.

1004
01:32:42,804 --> 01:32:46,035
- I didn't know how you'd take it.
- Congratulations!

1005
01:32:48,343 --> 01:32:50,277
I knew you'd understand.

1006
01:32:50,779 --> 01:32:53,839
And I know you'll really like
and admire Sophia.

1007
01:32:54,115 --> 01:32:56,276
She's quite a painter, a teacher...

1008
01:32:57,118 --> 01:32:59,586
...and she's also managing my gallery.

1009
01:32:59,955 --> 01:33:01,820
And she's a great cook.

1010
01:33:03,158 --> 01:33:07,595
But you know, this marriage is not
going to change my current lifestyle.

1011
01:33:08,296 --> 01:33:11,163
She's moving into my apartment
this weekend.

1012
01:33:12,634 --> 01:33:16,092
Pretty much the same place,
same job and the same life.

1013
01:33:17,339 --> 01:33:18,636
Of course.

1014
01:33:21,810 --> 01:33:23,744
It's 2:00 already.

1015
01:33:24,112 --> 01:33:26,706
- I'd better be going.
- To where? I'll take you.

1016
01:33:26,815 --> 01:33:28,043
I'm fine.

1017
01:33:30,652 --> 01:33:33,280
Actually, I've got two hours to spare.

1018
01:33:34,322 --> 01:33:38,782
Will we be continuing
with our "friendship" status like before?

1019
01:33:40,495 --> 01:33:43,225
I mean,
you do know about the office in the back.

1020
01:33:45,066 --> 01:33:47,193
Sorry. I should go now.

1021
01:33:49,738 --> 01:33:51,501
Let's keep in touch.

1022
01:34:17,599 --> 01:34:20,295
Please think about it some more,
Master Chu.

1023
01:34:20,435 --> 01:34:23,131
The restaurant really needs your presence.

1024
01:34:23,371 --> 01:34:26,772
With so many good young chefs,
you can easily find someone.

1025
01:34:26,941 --> 01:34:31,275
But none with the expertise
in the art of Chinese cuisine like you.

1026
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:35,646
Just your presence there would be
a living, treasured cookbook.

1027
01:34:36,685 --> 01:34:40,280
Do I just stand in the kitchen
until I rest in peace, like Old Wen?

1028
01:34:40,388 --> 01:34:43,687
It's been said,
"People die for money. Birds die for food."

1029
01:34:43,925 --> 01:34:46,621
To die for money is a man's business...

1030
01:34:46,961 --> 01:34:50,692
...but to die for food?
That's for the birds. Is it worth it?

1031
01:34:50,899 --> 01:34:55,097
There's truth to the saying. But your life
has been devoted to the art of cooking.

1032
01:34:55,236 --> 01:34:57,397
What a pity to just let it go.

1033
01:34:57,806 --> 01:34:59,774
People today are so insensitive.

1034
01:34:59,908 --> 01:35:03,002
They can't appreciate
the art of exquisite dining.

1035
01:35:03,344 --> 01:35:06,609
Chinese cuisine has traveled
to Taiwan for 40 years.

1036
01:35:06,781 --> 01:35:10,547
And just like the rivers
that eventually flow into the sea...

1037
01:35:10,885 --> 01:35:13,080
...it's all the same in the end.

1038
01:35:13,188 --> 01:35:16,851
Even a mess of slop can pass for
"Joy Luck Dragon Phoenix."

1039
01:35:16,958 --> 01:35:18,687
What more can I say?

1040
01:35:19,527 --> 01:35:21,051
What is "pity"?

1041
01:35:22,163 --> 01:35:25,792
Only when a heart feels dissatisfied
can it feel pity.

1042
01:35:26,101 --> 01:35:30,765
Fortunately, I don't plan on wasting
my whole life on this stuff.

1043
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:33,802
Miss Chu.

1044
01:35:34,008 --> 01:35:37,171
Please help me to convince your father
not to retire.

1045
01:35:37,378 --> 01:35:39,437
Dad, you plan on retiring?

1046
01:35:41,616 --> 01:35:44,847
It's his own business.
He can make his own decision.

1047
01:35:55,697 --> 01:35:59,326
Master Chu, are you thinking of
opening your own restaurant?

1048
01:36:01,002 --> 01:36:03,698
Be sure to let me know. I'll follow you.

1049
01:36:08,576 --> 01:36:09,565
I see that Mr. Chu worries a lot
about his daughters.

1050
01:36:13,648 --> 01:36:17,516
- Isn't that parenting?
- It's harder for a single man.

1051
01:36:18,386 --> 01:36:20,183
It's been so many years.

1052
01:36:20,288 --> 01:36:22,119
When did Mrs. Chu die?

1053
01:36:23,158 --> 01:36:26,423
When Jia-Ning was 4 years old,
about 16 years ago.

1054
01:36:26,761 --> 01:36:29,025
A widower usually has a short life.

1055
01:36:29,130 --> 01:36:30,961
Why didn't he remarry?

1056
01:36:31,633 --> 01:36:33,863
Maybe because of the children.

1057
01:36:35,170 --> 01:36:38,662
He needs to wise up.
He's raising his daughters for others.

1058
01:36:38,807 --> 01:36:41,298
Only the ones nobody wants
end up with you.

1059
01:36:41,442 --> 01:36:45,003
If you were so wise, you wouldn't be
haranguing over my divorce.

1060
01:36:45,146 --> 01:36:47,842
And you shouldn't blame Jin-Feng either.

1061
01:36:48,082 --> 01:36:50,243
What do you think of Mr. Chu?

1062
01:36:50,518 --> 01:36:52,008
What about him?

1063
01:36:52,554 --> 01:36:55,523
He seems like a nice person
and a great cook.

1064
01:36:55,824 --> 01:36:57,689
He doesn't talk much...

1065
01:36:58,026 --> 01:36:59,755
...but we really connect.

1066
01:37:44,305 --> 01:37:46,830
I have a little announcement to make.

1067
01:37:49,611 --> 01:37:52,842
You know, just like Jia-Ning, I...

1068
01:37:53,448 --> 01:37:55,973
- You're pregnant?
- Nonsense! Of course not!

1069
01:37:56,084 --> 01:37:57,244
But...

1070
01:37:59,087 --> 01:38:00,714
It's just that...

1071
01:38:04,392 --> 01:38:06,087
We just couldn't wait...

1072
01:38:06,194 --> 01:38:07,354
He wants to...

1073
01:38:07,462 --> 01:38:08,895
But I'm a Christian...

1074
01:38:08,997 --> 01:38:11,795
We asked the priest to marry us
this morning.

1075
01:38:12,834 --> 01:38:16,361
Hold on! He's waiting outside right now.
One second!

1076
01:38:26,915 --> 01:38:28,712
Come in! Come in.

1077
01:38:35,023 --> 01:38:38,186
Dad, Jia-Chien,
this is my husband, Chou Ming-Dao.

1078
01:38:39,193 --> 01:38:40,182
Hi.

1079
01:39:38,286 --> 01:39:39,583
Jia-Chien!

1080
01:39:41,556 --> 01:39:44,116
- You scared me.
- You're gonna be late.

1081
01:39:58,339 --> 01:40:01,035
- What are you doing?
- Packing Jia-Jen's things.

1082
01:40:01,142 --> 01:40:03,235
- Let me help you.
- I'm okay.

1083
01:40:07,915 --> 01:40:10,475
I loved this room when I was a child.

1084
01:40:10,985 --> 01:40:13,886
When your mom wanted
some peace and quiet...

1085
01:40:14,789 --> 01:40:17,155
...she also liked being in this room.

1086
01:40:17,258 --> 01:40:21,388
Mrs. Liang says this room
is airy and has plenty of light...

1087
01:40:21,829 --> 01:40:25,390
...and it would be the perfect place
for an exercise bike.

1088
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:27,131
Mrs. Liang?

1089
01:40:28,202 --> 01:40:32,229
I went to Jin-Rong's place last night
and told them Jia-Jen's news.

1090
01:40:33,441 --> 01:40:36,467
I'm running late.
I'll be back early from work.

1091
01:40:38,780 --> 01:40:41,578
Don't move any more stuff until I get back.

1092
01:40:49,123 --> 01:40:50,681
Let me tell you...

1093
01:40:50,792 --> 01:40:54,694
...kids are creditors collecting
for the sins of our past lives.

1094
01:40:54,796 --> 01:40:58,027
They know no compassion.
It's better off not having any.

1095
01:40:58,132 --> 01:41:01,101
"Life is a boundless sea.
Only returning to shore is happiness."

1096
01:41:01,235 --> 01:41:02,930
Marriage is a source of sin.

1097
01:41:03,071 --> 01:41:07,030
A series of worries, disappointments,
misery, conflict and ingratitude.

1098
01:41:07,175 --> 01:41:10,941
I tell you, every family has a book
of unspeakable problems.

1099
01:41:13,014 --> 01:41:15,141
I have a cause for celebration!

1100
01:41:15,249 --> 01:41:18,844
Jin-Rong's divorce decree came through.
I should have it framed.

1101
01:41:18,953 --> 01:41:21,820
I want her to remember
her mother's words forever.

1102
01:41:21,923 --> 01:41:24,824
I warned her not to marry that bastard!

1103
01:41:24,926 --> 01:41:29,363
I'll have this divorce decree framed
and hung on the bathroom wall.

1104
01:41:31,632 --> 01:41:33,725
You shouldn't worry so much.

1105
01:41:34,001 --> 01:41:36,196
Whatever will be, will be.

1106
01:41:36,637 --> 01:41:41,267
Instead of thinking about those creditors,
why not think more about yourself?

1107
01:42:09,137 --> 01:42:11,264
Be careful. Watch your step.

1108
01:42:15,076 --> 01:42:17,203
Dad's really willing to give the vase to me?

1109
01:42:17,311 --> 01:42:21,145
Not really.
But if you don't take it, Mrs. Liang will.

1110
01:42:21,716 --> 01:42:25,152
- What do you mean?
- She's been here almost every night.

1111
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:27,410
You're kidding.

1112
01:42:28,489 --> 01:42:30,855
I decided not to go to Amsterdam.

1113
01:42:33,995 --> 01:42:37,158
- Are you okay? Be careful.
- No problem.

1114
01:42:40,368 --> 01:42:43,496
He's not Christian.
Why did you agree to marry him?

1115
01:42:43,638 --> 01:42:45,003
He will be.

1116
01:42:48,075 --> 01:42:50,771
- Welcome. Table for one?
- I'm meeting someone.

1117
01:42:50,878 --> 01:42:52,607
Sure, help yourself.

1118
01:42:59,854 --> 01:43:02,846
Thanks for coming.
I thought you might not show up.

1119
01:43:02,957 --> 01:43:04,151
Why not?

1120
01:43:04,692 --> 01:43:06,182
The other night...

1121
01:43:06,394 --> 01:43:09,261
- What kind of tea would you like?
- What are you having?

1122
01:43:09,363 --> 01:43:11,422
- Mountain tea.
- Same for me.

1123
01:43:11,566 --> 01:43:12,863
Thank you.

1124
01:43:20,541 --> 01:43:23,874
You know,
I understand what you're going through...

1125
01:43:24,545 --> 01:43:28,003
...although I can't really explain it.
- Neither can I.

1126
01:43:28,416 --> 01:43:31,283
It's complicated, but I can understand that.

1127
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:33,780
Thanks.

1128
01:43:38,993 --> 01:43:42,554
I heard that you turned down
your promotion. Everyone's shocked.

1129
01:43:42,663 --> 01:43:44,858
I hope I wasn't a factor.

1130
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:47,065
Not at all.

1131
01:43:47,468 --> 01:43:49,527
Well, maybe only a tiny bit.

1132
01:43:51,105 --> 01:43:55,007
I don't know. It's a whole series of things.
A family wedding...

1133
01:43:55,309 --> 01:43:58,506
...actually, two marriages,
and someone passed away.

1134
01:43:58,813 --> 01:44:00,906
And a really bad investment.

1135
01:44:02,083 --> 01:44:05,849
All of a sudden, everything's gone.
Plus my father's health.

1136
01:44:06,087 --> 01:44:08,555
So I've decided
to stay with him for a while.

1137
01:44:08,656 --> 01:44:10,385
I think he needs me.

1138
01:44:15,329 --> 01:44:18,492
The chief asked me
to try to change your mind.

1139
01:44:18,599 --> 01:44:21,067
But what the hell? It's just a job.

1140
01:44:25,906 --> 01:44:27,601
I'm glad, you know?

1141
01:44:28,676 --> 01:44:29,734
Glad?

1142
01:44:30,244 --> 01:44:33,941
That we didn't make love.
Not that I still wouldn't want to.

1143
01:44:35,650 --> 01:44:38,380
But seeing you like this makes me happy.

1144
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:40,987
I'm happy, too.

1145
01:44:42,556 --> 01:44:45,423
I think that we can be really good friends.

1146
01:44:46,861 --> 01:44:47,919
Sure.

1147
01:44:49,230 --> 01:44:51,198
Then, good friends?

1148
01:44:55,303 --> 01:44:56,736
Good friends.

1149
01:45:05,079 --> 01:45:09,482
When you were a baby, I'd spin this
for hours. You wouldn't let me stop.

1150
01:45:10,484 --> 01:45:13,612
Well, please stop now.
I'm getting nauseous again.

1151
01:45:16,557 --> 01:45:17,922
And I should go.

1152
01:45:18,025 --> 01:45:20,585
I told Dad I'd help shop
for Sunday's dinner.

1153
01:45:20,695 --> 01:45:24,756
Why did Dad send formal invitations?
Is it for Guo-Lun and Ming-Dao?

1154
01:45:24,865 --> 01:45:28,198
He said he has his own
"little announcement" to make.

1155
01:45:28,736 --> 01:45:30,761
- Mrs. Liang?
- Probably.

1156
01:45:32,206 --> 01:45:36,199
I think, unlike you and Guo-Lun,
they won't rush their engagement.

1157
01:45:36,344 --> 01:45:39,541
So hopefully,
he'll have enough time to think it over...

1158
01:45:39,647 --> 01:45:41,638
...and realize what a nightmare she is.

1159
01:45:41,749 --> 01:45:45,583
But I don't think he will fully recover
from the shock of recent events.

1160
01:45:45,686 --> 01:45:48,052
Had I known he'd go crazy,
I wouldn't have...

1161
01:45:48,155 --> 01:45:49,918
Don't blame yourself.

1162
01:45:50,224 --> 01:45:53,352
He's not going crazy. He's an old horse.

1163
01:45:53,894 --> 01:45:55,862
Horses don't get married.

1164
01:46:28,562 --> 01:46:30,189
What do you think?

1165
01:46:41,542 --> 01:46:45,569
Don't just run around!
One of you chase it, and the other grab it!

1166
01:46:46,147 --> 01:46:47,876
Over here, Ming-Dao!

1167
01:46:52,653 --> 01:46:53,813
Got it!

1168
01:47:05,633 --> 01:47:07,897
- Jin-Rong, Mrs. Liang.
- Grandpa Chu!

1169
01:47:08,035 --> 01:47:11,163
A tie for your father
and a bottle of good wine.

1170
01:47:11,539 --> 01:47:14,007
- Also for your father.
- You shouldn't have.

1171
01:47:14,141 --> 01:47:16,735
I should've been here earlier to help.

1172
01:47:17,178 --> 01:47:18,304
Fine.

1173
01:47:19,613 --> 01:47:22,810
- I hope we're not intruding.
- No, not at all.

1174
01:47:24,418 --> 01:47:27,353
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

1175
01:47:28,756 --> 01:47:30,223
Come, a toast.

1176
01:47:30,558 --> 01:47:32,253
Cheers.

1177
01:47:37,231 --> 01:47:39,096
Please help yourselves.

1178
01:47:39,467 --> 01:47:41,765
Everyone, please help yourself.

1179
01:47:47,274 --> 01:47:49,469
- Are you moving abroad?
- Not anymore.

1180
01:47:49,610 --> 01:47:51,237
Mom, what's this?

1181
01:47:53,914 --> 01:47:55,779
Do you want some shrimp?

1182
01:47:57,718 --> 01:48:00,152
It's a simple meal. Please help yourselves.

1183
01:48:00,254 --> 01:48:02,620
Mr. Chu, you've prepared too much.

1184
01:48:02,857 --> 01:48:04,449
Help yourselves.

1185
01:48:05,159 --> 01:48:06,592
Winter melon soup.

1186
01:48:06,694 --> 01:48:10,596
Today's Red Seven Star Fish was too big.
They're best at 2 pounds.

1187
01:48:10,698 --> 01:48:11,960
Listen to yourself.

1188
01:48:12,066 --> 01:48:16,002
So picky already. You'll never find
a husband when you grow up.

1189
01:48:18,372 --> 01:48:19,896
You girls are lucky.

1190
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:22,941
Your father's a great cook.
Look at this wonderful cuisine.

1191
01:48:23,043 --> 01:48:26,035
Looks, smells and tastes good.
It's all here.

1192
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:34,251
Jia-Jen...

1193
01:48:35,956 --> 01:48:37,787
...you two, bottoms up.

1194
01:48:41,028 --> 01:48:43,428
Jia-Ning, you two, bottoms up.

1195
01:48:48,168 --> 01:48:50,864
- Don't drink too much.
- I'm fine.

1196
01:48:52,473 --> 01:48:53,838
Jia-Chien...

1197
01:48:54,975 --> 01:48:56,306
...bottoms up!

1198
01:49:25,172 --> 01:49:29,074
Fate has brought us to this table tonight.

1199
01:49:29,176 --> 01:49:30,336
That's right.

1200
01:49:30,444 --> 01:49:32,844
Although we're not actually related...

1201
01:49:32,947 --> 01:49:35,313
...we're still considered family.

1202
01:49:37,351 --> 01:49:39,683
And since we're one big family...

1203
01:49:39,787 --> 01:49:42,654
...there's really nothing
we can't say to each other.

1204
01:49:42,756 --> 01:49:45,850
I've kept this inside me for a long time.

1205
01:49:46,627 --> 01:49:50,256
It wasn't as if I was trying to hide
any secrets from you.

1206
01:49:50,831 --> 01:49:53,994
I just feel that I shouldn't allow
my personal affairs...

1207
01:49:54,134 --> 01:49:57,331
...to be the family's worry
and, thus, become a burden.

1208
01:49:57,471 --> 01:50:00,167
As a family, living under the same roof...

1209
01:50:00,541 --> 01:50:02,975
...we can still live separate lives.

1210
01:50:03,077 --> 01:50:07,571
This worry that we have for each other
is what makes us a family.

1211
01:50:08,182 --> 01:50:10,742
I've done nothing wrong by not telling.

1212
01:50:10,851 --> 01:50:13,445
By telling, I can end this lingering.

1213
01:50:13,787 --> 01:50:17,120
I cannot live my life
like my methods of cooking.

1214
01:50:17,491 --> 01:50:21,120
I can't wait until all the ingredients
are prepared and then cook.

1215
01:50:21,228 --> 01:50:24,755
Of course, after the first bite,
whether it's sour, sweet or spicy...

1216
01:50:24,865 --> 01:50:27,390
...it's totally up to the individual.

1217
01:50:28,736 --> 01:50:31,136
That's it for now. I'll continue after dinner.

1218
01:50:31,238 --> 01:50:34,264
- Dad, what are you trying to say?
- We already knew.

1219
01:50:34,408 --> 01:50:36,342
- You do?
- Let Dad tell us.

1220
01:50:36,477 --> 01:50:39,605
Go ahead and say it.
The dishes are getting cold.

1221
01:50:39,780 --> 01:50:40,940
So be it!

1222
01:50:41,048 --> 01:50:44,279
Since the situation has come this far,
I'll say it.

1223
01:50:45,753 --> 01:50:49,416
To me,
this house contains several old memories.

1224
01:50:50,557 --> 01:50:54,084
But now, it's so empty,
and almost everyone has left.

1225
01:50:54,662 --> 01:50:56,357
I've decided to sell it.

1226
01:50:56,463 --> 01:50:59,057
I found a really nice place on Kum Dao.

1227
01:51:00,134 --> 01:51:03,103
It's a bit old
and may require some remodeling.

1228
01:51:03,203 --> 01:51:05,068
But it's a great place.

1229
01:51:05,205 --> 01:51:07,298
It should be ready in a few months.

1230
01:51:07,441 --> 01:51:10,137
Great. It's always nice
to move to a new place.

1231
01:51:10,244 --> 01:51:12,712
New people, new house, new life.

1232
01:51:13,247 --> 01:51:14,373
Great.

1233
01:51:15,749 --> 01:51:17,740
I'll make a toast to you...

1234
01:51:18,686 --> 01:51:20,278
...Auntie Liang.

1235
01:51:20,421 --> 01:51:22,855
I haven't taken care of Jin-Rong...

1236
01:51:23,157 --> 01:51:25,421
...but I can swear to Heaven...

1237
01:51:25,526 --> 01:51:28,086
...as long as I, Old Chu,
have one last breath...

1238
01:51:28,195 --> 01:51:31,756
...I'll see that they both
shall never go cold or hungry...

1239
01:51:31,865 --> 01:51:34,857
...and that you're always welcome
in our new home.

1240
01:51:35,669 --> 01:51:36,863
Take a look.

1241
01:51:37,004 --> 01:51:41,805
This is a medical report I had done
at the Veteran's Hospital last month.

1242
01:51:42,276 --> 01:51:44,801
Please, Auntie, we ask for your approval.

1243
01:51:45,012 --> 01:51:46,980
I'll first drink a toast.

1244
01:51:49,416 --> 01:51:50,576
Cheers!

1245
01:51:51,185 --> 01:51:53,312
Dad, you should stop drinking.

1246
01:51:53,420 --> 01:51:55,911
- You're getting drunk.
- I'm not drunk.

1247
01:51:57,391 --> 01:51:58,619
Jin-Rong.

1248
01:52:02,062 --> 01:52:05,259
Uncle Chu and I have been planning
for a long time.

1249
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:09,831
But because of this terrible divorce,
our love was a secret until now.

1250
01:52:11,305 --> 01:52:13,739
Although love should be
between two people...

1251
01:52:13,874 --> 01:52:16,240
...Uncle Chu loves all of you.

1252
01:52:17,244 --> 01:52:19,041
And he loves Shan-Shan also.

1253
01:52:19,146 --> 01:52:22,673
So he really wishes
for your approval and understanding.

1254
01:52:23,884 --> 01:52:25,215
As for me...

1255
01:52:26,186 --> 01:52:28,984
...I only hope to be with him at his side.

1256
01:52:29,690 --> 01:52:31,317
I'm willing to be with him.

1257
01:52:31,425 --> 01:52:33,359
That's enough! Don't say anymore.

1258
01:52:33,460 --> 01:52:35,860
- Is there a mistake?
- Dad, are you crazy?

1259
01:52:35,963 --> 01:52:38,864
I'm not crazy.
I know exactly what I'm doing.

1260
01:52:41,101 --> 01:52:42,090
Mom?

1261
01:52:44,671 --> 01:52:46,730
- Loosen her collar!
- Don't touch me!

1262
01:52:46,874 --> 01:52:50,605
Keep your dirty hands off of me!
Damn you, Old Chu!

1263
01:52:50,711 --> 01:52:53,179
- Help carry her to the sofa!
- Be careful!

1264
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:55,646
- Be careful!
- Damn you! Don't touch me!

1265
01:52:55,749 --> 01:52:57,740
Take me home, Jin-Rong!

1266
01:52:58,619 --> 01:53:03,522
Let me tell you, don't even think about it
for as long as I still have my last breath.

1267
01:53:03,657 --> 01:53:06,251
- Let's go, Shan-Shan.
- Mom, calm down.

1268
01:53:06,927 --> 01:53:08,952
- Let's take her home.
- Okay, okay.

1269
01:53:09,062 --> 01:53:10,927
What kind of world is this?

1270
01:53:11,031 --> 01:53:12,498
I want to die!

1271
01:53:12,866 --> 01:53:15,630
- What kind of family is this?
- Be careful!

1272
01:53:16,203 --> 01:53:17,830
I'll take Shan-Shan.

1273
01:53:21,141 --> 01:53:23,837
God won't let you get away with this!

1274
01:53:25,279 --> 01:53:27,440
I want to go back to America!

1275
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:21,426
Hello?

1276
01:54:21,735 --> 01:54:23,760
Guo-Lun, how are you?

1277
01:54:24,271 --> 01:54:25,238
<i>Fine.</i>

1278
01:54:25,439 --> 01:54:29,375
But we've been up all night.
I don't have the heart to wake them.

1279
01:54:29,643 --> 01:54:32,009
<i>Don't wake them. Get some sleep.</i>

1280
01:54:32,312 --> 01:54:35,804
<i>I'll be back again in a few months.
I'll come visit then.</i>

1281
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:39,908
Bye, then. Tell us all about Amsterdam
when you come back.

1282
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:43,016
And thanks for your help
these past months.

1283
01:54:43,457 --> 01:54:45,118
Take care of your wife and kid.

1284
01:54:45,292 --> 01:54:46,623
Of course.

1285
01:54:46,927 --> 01:54:49,088
Say hello to Jia-Jen and Ming-Dao for us.

1286
01:54:49,329 --> 01:54:53,356
They can't make it either.
They've got a big day today themselves.

1287
01:54:54,735 --> 01:54:55,667
Bye.

1288
01:55:04,278 --> 01:55:07,372
Do you believe that Jesus Christ
has forgiven your sins...

1289
01:55:07,481 --> 01:55:09,972
...and made you a new person?
- Yes.

1290
01:55:10,250 --> 01:55:14,516
Do you believe in following Jesus Christ
unto eternity and never regret?

1291
01:55:15,088 --> 01:55:16,077
Yes.

1292
01:55:16,189 --> 01:55:18,919
Believe in your heart.
Say "yes" from your mouth:

1293
01:55:19,226 --> 01:55:22,195
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Spirit...

1294
01:55:22,296 --> 01:55:24,230
...I baptize you. Amen.

1295
01:55:56,964 --> 01:55:58,693
How are you feeling?

1296
01:55:59,399 --> 01:56:01,560
Fine. Just a small headache.

1297
01:56:02,469 --> 01:56:04,903
- You should get going.
- All right.

1298
01:56:05,572 --> 01:56:09,235
I'll pick up Shan-Shan on my return.
Get some rest at home.

1299
01:56:09,343 --> 01:56:10,401
Sure.

1300
01:56:24,424 --> 01:56:25,755
I love you.

1301
01:56:54,788 --> 01:56:55,982
SOLD

1302
01:57:20,981 --> 01:57:22,949
- Hi.
- Hi. Please come in.

1303
01:57:24,151 --> 01:57:26,051
You'll be the only one here tonight.

1304
01:57:26,153 --> 01:57:29,122
Everyone else called to apologize,
because they had plans.

1305
01:57:29,222 --> 01:57:33,420
- Where's Shan-Shan and Jin-Rong?
- Jin-Rong's not feeling well today.

1306
01:57:33,660 --> 01:57:35,855
Shan-Shan is with her grandma.

1307
01:57:36,797 --> 01:57:39,698
No need to take off your shoes.
Just come in.

1308
01:57:40,767 --> 01:57:44,203
- Did they tell you the ultrasound results?
- I don't want to know.

1309
01:57:44,337 --> 01:57:45,634
Another daughter?

1310
01:58:00,754 --> 01:58:03,245
Have a seat. Dinner's almost ready.

1311
01:58:27,948 --> 01:58:30,644
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. It's delicious.

1312
01:58:31,084 --> 01:58:32,711
- But...
- But what?

1313
01:58:33,753 --> 01:58:37,416
You put too much ginger in the soup.
Its effect is ruined.

1314
01:58:41,394 --> 01:58:43,021
Too much ginger?

1315
01:58:43,163 --> 01:58:45,723
This is the same as Mother's recipe.

1316
01:58:46,032 --> 01:58:48,296
I remember you
bickering about this back then.

1317
01:58:48,435 --> 01:58:50,528
You're too timid with ginger.

1318
01:58:50,804 --> 01:58:53,739
- It's just a comment.
- Don't boss me around the kitchen.

1319
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:56,673
I wasn't. It was a minor critique.

1320
01:58:57,144 --> 01:58:58,634
The taste...

1321
01:58:59,513 --> 01:59:00,810
Taste.

1322
01:59:04,317 --> 01:59:06,148
What about the taste?

1323
01:59:10,056 --> 01:59:11,421
Jia-Chien...

1324
01:59:12,225 --> 01:59:14,853
...your soup...
- What about my soup?

1325
01:59:24,971 --> 01:59:27,337
Your soup, Jia-Chien...

1326
01:59:29,409 --> 01:59:31,070
...I can taste it.

1327
01:59:32,579 --> 01:59:34,046
You can taste?

1328
01:59:40,287 --> 01:59:41,777
I can taste it.

1329
01:59:44,324 --> 01:59:45,689
Some more...

1330
01:59:46,159 --> 01:59:47,456
...please.

1331
01:59:58,905 --> 02:00:00,133
Daughter.

1332
02:00:01,208 --> 02:00:02,368
Dad.
