Are you alright?
沒事吧！

123
00:18:36,311 --> 00:18:38,404
Laying railway tracks?

124
00:18:40,281 --> 00:18:43,444
It's no easy task in the mountains
在山裡鋪鐵道可不容易啊…

不過山上的生蕃…

130
00:18:59,134 --> 00:19:00,802
Sir?

Captain
大尉，他只敢帶你們到人止關

in Meisi
然後她在她的眉溪老家過夜

138
00:19:46,548 --> 00:19:49,017
Those savages in the mountains
are rather ferocious

It was so dark last night
昨晚夜黑…

145
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,303
that we didn't notice we're surrounded
by cherry blossom trees
竟然不知道睡在這美麗的櫻花林

There's no way out!

All the human beings on this land

their eyes blank

and walk though the rugged valleys
他們羞愧地繞過顛簸難行的溪谷

Ubus..

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,800
our ancestors never lost
any of our hunting grounds in the past
我們祖先再怎樣也沒失去過獵場…

are taking them away from us now

278
00:39:56,358 --> 00:40:00,987

Schools, clinics, grocery stores

all the Wushe savages

It's not an easy task
真是不容易啊！

284
00:40:19,279 --> 00:40:25,373
Hard to imagine that this was once
the most uncivilized heartland here
很難想像這裡曾經是…
這島上最黑暗的心臟地帶呀！

285
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,690
Carrying logs..
他們扛著木頭

286
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:32,292
and walking from the lumberyard uphill to here
takes them a whole day, doesn't it?
從山上的製材場走到這裡…

287
00:40:32,292 --> 00:40:34,628
Don't worry. These savages are strong
不就已經一整天嗎？

288
00:40:34,628 --> 00:40:44,465
And they're more than happy
to earn some money for millet wine
沒關係…這些生蕃身強體壯
給他們幾個錢買酒就很高興了

289
00:40:46,006 --> 00:40:47,633
Come on. This way please
來，請往這邊走…

290
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,812
Mr. Satsuka,

how long have you been in Wushe?

So you know this region very well?

294
00:41:00,387 --> 00:41:04,224
Of course. My wife is a savage woman
當然…連我妻子都是蕃人了

295
00:41:04,224 --> 00:41:06,827
I know this region like the back of my hand
-It's this bone right here
-我能不瞭解嗎？
-就這塊骨頭

296
00:41:06,827 --> 00:41:08,762
It hurts so much when you press it
這樣壓就好痛…

297
00:41:08,762 --> 00:41:10,097
Right here?
是這裡嗎？

298
00:41:10,097 --> 00:41:11,798
Ah! Easy!
啊…你小力一點…

299
00:41:11,798 --> 00:41:13,629
Here! Have a drink!
來！來…喝酒！喝酒！

300
00:41:14,801 --> 00:41:18,872
No more wine for us please. We can't afford it
老闆，別再拿酒了
我們付不起錢呀！

It's alright
沒關係…沒關係…

302
00:41:20,974 --> 00:41:24,711
This one's on me

You're indeed a beautiful serpent
老闆呀，你真是一隻美麗的蛇唷！

304
00:41:32,652 --> 00:41:35,255
Every day I carry those damn logs
without getting paid properly
每天扛這種領不到錢的木頭

305
00:41:35,255 --> 00:41:37,587
Now I'm so broke that even my hounds
look down on me
窮到連我的獵犬都瞧不起我了…

306
00:41:38,859 --> 00:41:41,061
We're losing our hunting grounds
獵場都快沒了

307
00:41:41,061 --> 00:41:44,398
and you still keep the hounds
to look down on you?
還留著獵犬來瞧不起人？

308
00:41:44,398 --> 00:41:47,534
Those are the trees
that used to watch over our ancestors
Look!
你看！
那些看過我們祖先的樹…

309
00:41:47,534 --> 00:41:49,502
This is how they end up
都變成這樣的木頭了…

310
00:41:50,871 --> 00:41:54,975
Strange thing is, why so many constructions?
奇怪…怎麼有那麼多的工程啊？

311
00:41:54,975 --> 00:42:00,375
What? Not only do you befriend us with wine
but you speak our language fluently
咦！你這個酒料蕃通
蕃話講得很標準嘛！

312
00:42:02,249 --> 00:42:03,683
Hey! It's going to rain
喂！快下雨了

313

Stop drinking and go home!
-Good morning, sir!
-不回去還在這喝酒！

314
00:42:07,387 --> 00:42:09,287
Good morning, Mr. Policeman
警察大人好…

315

You've worked all day long
for such a mean wage
辛辛苦苦扛了一天的木頭

316
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,864
and you waste it on wine?
才賺那麼點錢…還買酒！

317
00:42:17,864 --> 00:42:21,635
What else can we do with so little money?
這些錢除了買酒還能做什麼？

318
00:42:21,635 --> 00:42:24,704
Yeah, right! We're savages, aren't we?
對啦！我們是蕃人

319
00:42:24,704 --> 00:42:27,641
We aren't supposed to know
anything about saving money
怎麼會懂得存錢呢？

320
00:42:27,641 --> 00:42:31,478
Yeah, Mr. Policeman. You're Japanese, sir
對啦！警察大人

You don't know how hard our lives are

Run, sir!

什麼事該先做也不知道…真難教…

Slipped into the ravine -Slipped?

Do you know how expensive it is?
你知道那一根木頭多貴嗎？

404
00:52:20,533 --> 00:52:21,761
Pihu!

405
00:52:25,638 --> 00:52:26,764

Chief Mouna..
莫那頭目…

407

Sir Yoshimura?
吉村大人

You're looking at me
at such a disrespectful angle

You will not get paid today

The precious logs are destroyed
好好的木頭拖成這樣…

We get nothing from working for you

Yoshimura, stop picking on them

These damn savages!

What? Checking out guns?

in those disappearing forests?
對啊！只是消失的森林哪來的獵物？

on our hunting grounds

this is the Mehebu hunting ground?
不知道這是我馬赫坡的獵場嗎？

Mouna! It's just a misunderstanding

into our Mehebu hunting ground
那也不應該跑進我馬赫坡的獵場！

456

This used to be our Toda hunting ground

when my uncle was alive

You Mehebu clansmen robbed it from us

But you live in Tnbarah Clan
但是你現在在屯巴拉

Take these red-foot pheasants

就給我帶著這群紅腳鳩…
滾離我的獵場！

466

because everything here
belongs to us Japanese now

Temu, you just wait and see
鐵木…

Go on and do it if you dare

Let's see who's killed first

I don't care if you're Mouna Rudo

are all out hunting, aren't they?

Wanna make some extra bucks?

Come with me to my boardinghouse! -No!
-陪我到宿舍喝酒吧！
-不要！

480
01:00:33,425 --> 01:00:35,154
I'll give you two dollars -No!

I know you Japanese policemen too well

Take that blind prey of yours and scram

It's true, and she accepted it too
真的，她也答應了…
