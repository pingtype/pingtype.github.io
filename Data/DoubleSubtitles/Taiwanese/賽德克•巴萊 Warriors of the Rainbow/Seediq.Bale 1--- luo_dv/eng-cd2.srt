1
00:00:02,324 --> 00:00:04,184
Mouna! Mouna!

2
00:00:06,394 --> 00:00:09,524
Bakan,
why does Mouna need so many matches?

3
00:00:10,434 --> 00:00:11,494
Who knows?

4
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:15,064
Had any meat, my boy?

5
00:00:15,934 --> 00:00:17,804
Have a drink!

6
00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:26,344
Father! Father!

7
00:00:27,714 --> 00:00:31,854
Father, can we slaughter a cow?

8
00:00:31,854 --> 00:00:33,824
Not enough to eat?

9
00:00:33,824 --> 00:00:37,384
It's enough, but we haven't had beef
for such a long time

10
00:00:40,024 --> 00:00:41,724
Do it then

11
00:00:43,394 --> 00:00:46,334
Let's slaughter a cow!

12
00:00:48,904 --> 00:00:52,104
Hooray! Let's slaughter a cow!

13
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,404
Baso, grab it!

14
00:01:22,404 --> 00:01:24,774
Grab its legs!

15
00:01:24,774 --> 00:01:25,894
Come on!

16
00:01:29,414 --> 00:01:31,434
I've cut off the head
of the Japanese Governor-general

17
00:01:35,354 --> 00:01:37,914
Wow! What a party!

18
00:01:41,384 --> 00:01:43,394
Sir Yoshimura

19
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,944
Whose wedding day is it?

20
00:01:45,994 --> 00:01:47,794
It's Watan and Lubi's

21
00:01:47,794 --> 00:01:49,734
Come! Have a drink with us, sir

22
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:50,824
No

23
00:01:52,164 --> 00:01:54,934
No -Come on, have a drink

24
00:01:54,934 --> 00:01:56,474
No way

25
00:01:56,474 --> 00:01:58,804
I don't drink the wine with your nasty saliva in it

26
00:01:58,804 --> 00:02:00,274
Come on, have a drink
-I told you that I don't want to

27
00:02:00,274 --> 00:02:02,144
Your hand is all dirty with blood

28
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,714
I invited you with good will
-You son-of-a-bitch!

29
00:02:08,714 --> 00:02:10,804
You've soiled me with blood!

30
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:14,024
I offered you a drink and you hit me?

31
00:02:14,024 --> 00:02:15,824
I'll beat you into senses!

32
00:02:15,824 --> 00:02:18,954
Stop!
-I don't need to reason with a savage

33
00:02:21,324 --> 00:02:23,164
What is it? Let's go look!

34
00:02:23,994 --> 00:02:26,234
Hurry up!

35
00:02:26,234 --> 00:02:28,704
I know what you said just now
with a boar's head in your hand

36
00:02:30,204 --> 00:02:33,444
Out of my way!
Say it again in Japanese if you dare

37
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,804
Say it again!

38
00:02:36,514 --> 00:02:42,144
Get out of my way! -I dare you!

39
00:02:43,184 --> 00:02:44,454
Come on, guys!

40
00:02:44,454 --> 00:02:45,744
Faster!

41
00:02:51,054 --> 00:02:52,084
Tado!

42
00:02:58,364 --> 00:02:59,834
Baso, kill him!

43
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:02,534
I'm holding down his feet! Beat him up!

44
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:06,774
I'm holding down his feet again!

45
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:10,304
Stop! All of you!

46
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,984
What is it? What the hell?

47
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:16,974
Let me cut off this pig head of yours!

48
00:03:39,374 --> 00:03:42,864
Stop! Stop! Yoshi..

49
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:44,274
Yoshimura

50
00:03:51,584 --> 00:03:52,744
Yoshimura

51
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:04,754
You're in big trouble

52
00:04:06,634 --> 00:04:09,804
You have the nerve to beat me up
-Let's kill him!

53
00:04:09,804 --> 00:04:11,274
Shut your mouth!

54
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:30,584
Excuse us! Let us through!

55
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:43,264
I'll kill all you Mehebu clansmen

56
00:04:43,974 --> 00:04:47,034
I'll kill you all

57
00:04:48,174 --> 00:04:51,444
Let's do it, Father,
before the Japanese kill us all

58
00:04:51,444 --> 00:04:54,934
Why the hell did you provoke him
when you knew he'd kill us all?

59
00:04:57,154 --> 00:04:59,154
You're nothing but a bunch of hounds

60
00:04:59,154 --> 00:05:00,954
that can only chase and hunt
and know nothing of self-restraint

61
00:05:01,684 --> 00:05:03,784
How much longer do I have to put up with you?

62
00:05:07,864 --> 00:05:10,224
Out of my way!

63
00:05:26,644 --> 00:05:28,614
Now you're here to bribe me with wine?

64
00:05:30,314 --> 00:05:31,614
It's too late

65
00:05:32,924 --> 00:05:35,384
I've filed the report on the case
of you beating up a police officer

66
00:05:37,524 --> 00:05:38,954
Tell you something..

67
00:05:40,864 --> 00:05:45,164
This time I'll destroy your clan

68
00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:48,764
Yoshimura..

69
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:53,474
I, Mouna Rudo, come here to
apologize to you personally

70
00:05:53,474 --> 00:05:56,034
Stop being so arrogant

71
00:05:57,674 --> 00:05:59,614
Who do you think you are?

72
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:08,554
You think you're still a chief?

73
00:06:10,524 --> 00:06:13,594
You can't even control your own sons

74
00:06:13,594 --> 00:06:16,584
I don't think you're qualified
to be a chief anymore

75
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,874
Get out!

76
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:27,744
Who the hell let you in?

77
00:06:27,744 --> 00:06:29,514
Get the hell out!

78
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,214
I don't want to see your faces again

79
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:32,404
Go home and rot!

80
00:06:34,584 --> 00:06:36,574
Hey! Why did you do that to him?
-Shut up!

81
00:06:50,434 --> 00:06:54,304
I couldn't sleep last night because of a mosquito

82
00:06:54,304 --> 00:06:56,824
Really? I'll see to it

83
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:04,734
Mr. Hanaoka!

84
00:07:08,114 --> 00:07:08,804
Yes?

85
00:07:09,484 --> 00:07:12,414
May I know which clan you grew up in?

86
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:14,884
Gungu Clan

87
00:07:15,624 --> 00:07:16,614
And your original name?

88
00:07:19,924 --> 00:07:21,594
Dakis Nawi

89
00:07:21,594 --> 00:07:23,464
Dakis Nawi

90
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:29,234
We have another savage policeman
named Hanoka Ichiro

91
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:33,434
He is the highest educated policemen here

92
00:07:35,574 --> 00:07:38,234
What are you doing this afternoon?

93
00:07:40,244 --> 00:07:43,214
I'm going home for some private matter

94
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:46,754
I was to ask you
to patrol all the savage clans with us

95
00:07:46,754 --> 00:07:50,954
and tell me the relationships among them all

96
00:07:51,794 --> 00:07:54,194
Come with us! -No, it's alright

97
00:07:55,364 --> 00:07:56,964
It's alright

98
00:07:56,964 --> 00:07:59,624
Do whatever you need to do

99
00:08:02,204 --> 00:08:03,474
It's alright

100
00:08:03,474 --> 00:08:05,334
Kabasawa will go with us -Yes

101
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:06,824
He knows the savages well too

102
00:08:26,124 --> 00:08:31,794
Yoshimura has reported
Tado's case to the substation

103
00:09:01,424 --> 00:09:04,164
I can't believe this Yoshimura

104
00:09:04,164 --> 00:09:06,904
Chief Mouna apologized to him personally

105
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:09,424
Why did he insist on filing the case?

106
00:09:10,904 --> 00:09:15,004
Yoshimura and Sugiura are not the same
as Kojima after all

107
00:09:15,004 --> 00:09:17,914
They will never try to understand our people

108
00:09:17,914 --> 00:09:23,404
If Kojima were living in Mehebu
there wouldn't be so much trouble

109
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:28,554
Since I was very little

110
00:09:30,024 --> 00:09:32,584
I've always been scared of Chief Mouna

111
00:09:35,594 --> 00:09:40,434
It looks as if underneath his mantle
he's always gripping his machete

112
00:09:40,434 --> 00:09:43,734
ready to draw it to kill anytime

113
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:47,704
He's no ordinary man

114
00:09:47,704 --> 00:09:50,644
He's impossible to be tamed

115
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:56,654
It must be difficult for him to torn between
the expectations of his fellow tribesmen

116
00:09:56,654 --> 00:09:59,924
and the intimidation of the Japanese

117
00:09:59,924 --> 00:10:02,544
Aren't we living like that as well?

118
00:10:04,054 --> 00:10:06,894
We don't want to be savages

119
00:10:06,894 --> 00:10:09,654
but however hard
we try to dress up like the Japanese

120
00:10:10,594 --> 00:10:14,534
we'll always be seen as uncivilized people

121
00:10:16,774 --> 00:10:19,904
We've lived like this for 20 years

122
00:10:19,904 --> 00:10:22,634
Another 20 years won't be impossible

123
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:26,914
By the time our children grow up

124
00:10:26,914 --> 00:10:30,404
maybe we will have changed forever
the savage image of ours

125
00:10:32,384 --> 00:10:34,324
Do we still have the chance?

126
00:10:35,224 --> 00:10:39,054
Mehebu Clan may be wiped out soon

127
00:11:06,154 --> 00:11:08,484
Father, let's fight the Japanese

128
00:11:11,954 --> 00:11:14,654
Ouch! It hurts! -You dumb ass!

129
00:11:17,564 --> 00:11:19,364
Father, don't be mad!

130
00:11:19,664 --> 00:11:23,034
Father! -You never learn!

131
00:11:23,034 --> 00:11:27,994
Enough! -You moron!

132
00:11:58,404 --> 00:12:00,334
Oh no! How come..

133
00:12:00,544 --> 00:12:03,974
It's the temporary bamboo bridge
that the savages used in the past

134
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:06,114
It's ugly and insecure,

135
00:12:06,114 --> 00:12:08,784
but they keep walking over it

136
00:12:08,784 --> 00:12:11,214
I'll tear it down sooner or later

137
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:14,754
But it saves them lots of time
if they walk over it to fetch water or to the field

138
00:12:14,754 --> 00:12:18,584
Look! This wire bridge is strong and firm

139
00:12:22,734 --> 00:12:23,894
Tado?

140
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:32,834
Tado?

141
00:12:36,274 --> 00:12:39,584
This young man is Tado Mouna

142
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:41,744
the eldest son of the Mehebu chief Mouna Rudo

143
00:12:43,654 --> 00:12:48,524
But he saw us without saying anything
Is there anything wrong with him?

144
00:12:48,524 --> 00:12:53,324
No, it's a habit of the savages
-It's not a very good habit

145
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:56,764
Oh well, they're savages after all

146
00:12:56,764 --> 00:12:58,994
Can you stop talking about them like that?

147
00:12:58,994 --> 00:13:03,304
Sugiura! -Welcome, sirs

148
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:05,134
This is Officer Sugiura

149
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:06,974
This way please

150
00:13:06,974 --> 00:13:09,244
You should've informed me
before you came here, sir

151
00:13:09,244 --> 00:13:13,814
I could've asked those savages
to welcome you with dances

152
00:13:13,814 --> 00:13:15,384
No need for that

153
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:18,314
We're only showing our hospitality

154
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:25,484
Chief Mouna!

155
00:13:28,524 --> 00:13:30,294
Chief Mouna!

156
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:36,964
What?

157
00:13:43,314 --> 00:13:44,974
Chief Mouna,

158
00:13:44,974 --> 00:13:47,684
can you tell me something about Japan?

159
00:13:47,684 --> 00:13:49,774
I know you've been there before

160
00:13:55,954 --> 00:13:59,664
They have armies, cannons, machineguns

161
00:13:59,664 --> 00:14:01,894
airplanes and large steamers in Japan

162
00:14:01,894 --> 00:14:05,694
There are more Japanese people
than the tree leaves in the forest

163
00:14:05,694 --> 00:14:08,164
than the pebbles in Jhuoshuei River

164
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:11,474
I know why you're asking me this

165
00:14:11,474 --> 00:14:13,604
You don't really want to know Japan

166
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:16,544
All you want is to remind me
how powerful the Japanese are

167
00:14:19,844 --> 00:14:23,114
Don't worry. I'll never forget

168
00:14:26,354 --> 00:14:31,394
Humph! You Japanese policemen
took us on the ship for days to Japan

169
00:14:31,394 --> 00:14:35,694
but all they showed us
were airplanes and cannons

170
00:14:35,694 --> 00:14:37,094
However, the policemen in Japan

171
00:14:37,094 --> 00:14:39,804
were much nicer and kinder
than those of you here

172
00:14:39,804 --> 00:14:43,034
They feared we'd revolt against them
so they tried their best to befriend us

173
00:14:43,034 --> 00:14:45,934
But those of you here in the mountains

174
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:49,174
always provoke us so much
that I want to hunt your heads

175
00:14:52,214 --> 00:14:55,914
Chief Mouna, I'm still a Seediq

176
00:14:55,914 --> 00:14:58,484
Although I'm now a Japanese policeman

177
00:14:58,484 --> 00:15:00,744
I never forget
that the same blood runs in our veins

178
00:15:04,054 --> 00:15:09,634
Dakis, when you die
are you entering a Japanese shrine?

179
00:15:09,634 --> 00:15:11,964
Or the heavenly home of our ancestors?

180
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,374
I heard that..

181
00:15:23,374 --> 00:15:28,374
in the school for savage children
you beat up our kids like the Japanese do

182
00:15:31,714 --> 00:15:41,024
I beat them up because I don't want
the Japanese to look down on them

183
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,234
You graduated from Normal School

184
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:48,264
You're more highly-educated
than any other Japanese policemen

185
00:15:48,264 --> 00:15:51,264
But how come you get the lowest salary?

186
00:15:52,674 --> 00:15:55,304
Don't the Japanese look down on you already?

187
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:57,834
Beating up your own people makes them
look down on you even more

188
00:16:05,784 --> 00:16:09,424
During our stay in Japan

189
00:16:09,424 --> 00:16:13,694
the Japanese knew all of us chiefs
from different clans hated one another

190
00:16:13,694 --> 00:16:17,134
but they made us sit together
at the dining table deliberately

191
00:16:17,134 --> 00:16:20,864
We were glaring at one another
all the time while we were eating

192
00:16:20,864 --> 00:16:23,764
intending to draw our machetes and kill

193
00:16:26,604 --> 00:16:29,734
Humph! The Japanese are good at these things

194
00:16:32,984 --> 00:16:36,104
Chief, is it so bad to be ruled by the Japanese?

195
00:16:38,184 --> 00:16:40,454
At least we're leading a civilized life

196
00:16:40,454 --> 00:16:43,794
We have schools and post offices

197
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:48,814
and we don't have to survive
by hunting savagely anymore

198
00:16:50,164 --> 00:16:52,194
Is it so bad to be ruled by the Japanese?

199
00:16:52,194 --> 00:16:54,324
Is it so good to be ruled by them?

200
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:58,634
Our men are forced to bend over
to carry logs on our backs

201
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:02,704
and our women have to kneel down
to serve and pour wine

202
00:17:03,014 --> 00:17:06,984
And all the money ends up
in the pockets of the Japanese policemen

203
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,484
I'm a chief

204
00:17:09,484 --> 00:17:12,054
but all I can do is get drunk
and pretend I see nothing and hear nothing

205
00:17:12,054 --> 00:17:14,084
What else can I do?

206
00:17:14,084 --> 00:17:17,954
Post offices? Stores? Schools?

207
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:21,464
Do any of those things
make our lives easier and better?

208
00:17:21,464 --> 00:17:26,264
Instead,
we're made to see how impoverished we are

209
00:17:36,214 --> 00:17:39,074
Chief, can't we bear it for another 20 years?

210
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:43,714
In 20 years, there will be no Seediq
and there will be no hunting ground

211
00:17:43,714 --> 00:17:45,514
All our children will have turned Japanese

212
00:18:06,704 --> 00:18:08,704
Chief Mouna,

213
00:18:08,704 --> 00:18:10,604
have you made up your mind to do it?

214
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:18,144
Chief Mouna?

215
00:18:19,354 --> 00:18:22,444
About Yoshimura... -I'm old

216
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,624
Don't worry

217
00:18:24,624 --> 00:18:27,794
The Japanese are far too powerful

218
00:18:27,794 --> 00:18:29,924
I won't go against them

219
00:18:31,464 --> 00:18:34,164
Go home

220
00:18:34,164 --> 00:18:38,974
This is the hunting ground
that belongs to me only

221
00:18:38,974 --> 00:18:40,374
Get lost

222
00:18:42,444 --> 00:18:44,234
Chief... -Get lost!

223
00:18:57,194 --> 00:19:00,854
Dakis, have a drink

224
00:19:01,564 --> 00:19:04,124
Go home and get yourself dead-drunk

225
00:19:06,334 --> 00:19:08,024
We can't drink anymore

226
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:10,834
We already... -Drink!

227
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:12,804
The millet wine that we make

228
00:19:14,304 --> 00:19:17,414
can set our people free

229
00:19:17,414 --> 00:19:20,404
making them sing and dance,
cry and laugh freely

230
00:19:21,414 --> 00:19:25,444
You'll see once you're drunk

231
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:27,144
Go home now

232
00:19:58,714 --> 00:20:00,014
Mouna!

233
00:20:45,394 --> 00:20:46,454
Father?

234
00:20:49,934 --> 00:20:55,044
Mouna, the tattoos on your face
are still so dark and clear

235
00:20:55,044 --> 00:20:58,644
You're indeed a Seediq Bale

236
00:20:58,644 --> 00:21:02,704
You're a true hero

237
00:21:09,224 --> 00:21:14,164
Mouna? Look at the lines on that rock

238
00:21:14,164 --> 00:21:16,624
It split into half
when struck by the lightening, didn't it?

239
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:25,304
In the dim light at dusk
the lightening splits a rock into half

240
00:21:25,304 --> 00:21:28,794
What a beautiful sight!

241
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:31,474
Father?

242
00:21:32,274 --> 00:21:35,304
I can't keep the intruders away

243
00:21:37,354 --> 00:21:43,354
(Ah, it's for real)

244
00:21:43,354 --> 00:21:49,564
(Here l am)

245
00:21:49,564 --> 00:21:56,234
(l used to guard these mountains
and forests bravely)

246
00:21:56,234 --> 00:22:00,904
(Oh yes, it's for real)

247
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:03,814
Mouna, let's sing

248
00:22:03,814 --> 00:22:06,274
We haven't sung together for long

249
00:22:14,154 --> 00:22:19,894
(Reminisce the people from the past)

250
00:22:19,894 --> 00:22:25,564
(Here l am)

251
00:22:25,564 --> 00:22:31,234
(l used to guard these mountains
and forests bravely)

252
00:22:31,234 --> 00:22:37,244
(These are our mountains)

253
00:22:37,244 --> 00:22:42,284
(These are our creeks)

254
00:22:42,284 --> 00:22:48,084
(We're the true Seediq Bale)

255
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:53,894
(We go hunting in the mountains)

256
00:22:53,894 --> 00:22:59,634
(We share food in our clan)

257
00:22:59,634 --> 00:23:05,134
(We fetch water from the creeks)

258
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:10,544
(l'm willing to give my life for these)

259
00:23:10,544 --> 00:23:16,214
(Oh, creek! Be quiet)

260
00:23:16,214 --> 00:23:22,124
(Sisin babblers are singing)

261
00:23:22,124 --> 00:23:27,824
(Sing us a beautiful song please)

262
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:33,364
(Sing for our people)

263
00:23:33,364 --> 00:23:38,904
(a song of our ancestral spirit)

264
00:23:38,904 --> 00:23:44,344
(l'm willing to give my life too)

265
00:23:44,344 --> 00:23:50,784
(When the lightening rifts the rock)

266
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:57,024
(a rainbow appears)

267
00:23:57,024 --> 00:24:02,424
(and a proud man emerges)

268
00:24:02,424 --> 00:24:07,934
(Who is this man so proud?)

269
00:24:07,934 --> 00:24:13,374
(lt's your offspring)

270
00:24:13,374 --> 00:24:21,244
(A Seediq Bale)

271
00:24:28,054 --> 00:24:29,584
What?

272
00:24:29,584 --> 00:24:36,634
Tado Mouna became a hero before I did

273
00:24:36,634 --> 00:24:40,204
Those Japanese are outrageous

274
00:24:40,204 --> 00:24:45,534
I can't believe they beat up someone
who offers them a drink

275
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:46,874
A while ago..

276
00:24:46,874 --> 00:24:51,844
three girls from Boarung Clan
were asked to serve them drinks

277
00:24:51,844 --> 00:24:53,934
and they were raped

278
00:24:55,114 --> 00:24:57,284
Why couldn't Tado be a real hero

279
00:24:57,284 --> 00:25:01,514
and kill Yoshimura right on the spot?

280
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,054
Kill him?

281
00:25:05,054 --> 00:25:10,224
Don't you remember how my family died?

282
00:25:11,334 --> 00:25:14,164
My father killed only one Japanese man

283
00:25:14,164 --> 00:25:18,534
and they burned my whole family alive

284
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:27,544
I was hiding in the woods watching

285
00:25:27,544 --> 00:25:29,844
without even blinking my eyes

286
00:25:33,584 --> 00:25:35,984
So..

287
00:25:35,984 --> 00:25:38,724
that's why we can't kill only one Japanese man

288
00:25:38,724 --> 00:25:41,764
We have to kill all of them to make a difference

289
00:25:41,764 --> 00:25:43,554
Are you kidding me?

290
00:25:44,464 --> 00:25:51,704
We wouldn't still be sitting here
if we could kill them all

291
00:25:52,904 --> 00:25:54,344
Now the Mehebu chief Mouna Rudo
is driven to bay

292
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,834
by that policeman from the lumberyard

293
00:25:57,874 --> 00:26:02,334
and the day after tomorrow on October 27th
is the big sports day

294
00:26:09,454 --> 00:26:18,054
By then, all the Japanese in Wushe
are going to gather in one place

295
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,574
Is it time already?

296
00:26:39,784 --> 00:26:42,284
Father, there won't be a better chance

297
00:26:42,284 --> 00:26:43,794
And we have no other choice

298
00:26:43,794 --> 00:26:45,524
We can't have the Japanese look down
on us anymore

299
00:26:45,524 --> 00:26:47,694
We need to show them what we're made of

300
00:26:47,694 --> 00:26:49,824
Let's fight them, Chief

301
00:26:49,824 --> 00:26:52,294
Yeah! Let's fight them

302
00:26:55,634 --> 00:26:57,474
Young men..

303
00:26:57,474 --> 00:27:03,874
I hate the Japanese no less than you do

304
00:27:03,874 --> 00:27:07,244
But do you realize that

305
00:27:07,244 --> 00:27:10,614
we're going to die after all this
and all our people will be wiped out?

306
00:27:11,454 --> 00:27:14,784
Our ancestors shed their blood
in exchange for our lives

307
00:27:14,784 --> 00:27:18,194
Now we're taking our children along
to the battlefield to shed blood

308
00:27:18,194 --> 00:27:20,124
We're Seediq Bale, aren't we?

309
00:27:24,134 --> 00:27:28,124
Temu, does your father know you're here?

310
00:27:28,804 --> 00:27:32,334
My father told me that I should ask Chief Mouna

311
00:27:32,334 --> 00:27:34,344
to help us youngsters get our faces tattooed

312
00:27:34,344 --> 00:27:36,444
so that the ancestors' spirits
guarding the rainbow bridge

313
00:27:36,444 --> 00:27:39,974
will recognize us as the true Seediqs

314
00:28:03,604 --> 00:28:04,374
Father?

315
00:28:04,374 --> 00:28:07,734
If we want revenge,
it'd be the business of Mehebu Clan alone

316
00:28:08,274 --> 00:28:10,514
But if we're offering a blood sacrifice
to our ancestors

317
00:28:10,514 --> 00:28:15,314
it will be the business of all the 12 clans
in Wushe

318
00:28:16,714 --> 00:28:19,754
Keep it a secret before action

319
00:28:19,754 --> 00:28:21,584
We must tell none of the elders,
children or women in all these clans

320
00:28:21,584 --> 00:28:23,994
When did you..

321
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:26,624
I'm speaking here. Are you listening?

322
00:28:26,624 --> 00:28:28,494
Keep it a secret before action

323
00:28:28,494 --> 00:28:31,064
I knew Chief Mouna had a plan already

324
00:28:31,064 --> 00:28:34,064
What do you know?
It's your idea and your responsibility

325
00:28:34,064 --> 00:28:36,334
Inform the chiefs of all the 12 clans

326
00:28:41,504 --> 00:28:43,494
Tomorrow morning..

327
00:28:45,374 --> 00:28:47,774
we're going to gather in Wushe

328
00:28:50,314 --> 00:28:53,304
and offer a blood sacrifice

329
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:04,664
Our ancestors' spirits..

330
00:29:04,664 --> 00:29:06,754
We're here for the guns. Sorry to disturb you

331
00:29:20,584 --> 00:29:23,954
Boss.. -Welcome. This way please

332
00:29:23,954 --> 00:29:26,714
Fill them up with salt
And give me ten boxes of matches

333
00:29:26,714 --> 00:29:28,454
Wow! Lots of things to buy, huh?

334
00:29:28,454 --> 00:29:31,494
Boss, we'll pay for it next time

335
00:29:31,494 --> 00:29:32,624
On credit again?

336
00:29:32,624 --> 00:29:35,154
Yes, we can -How much is it?

337
00:29:35,694 --> 00:29:37,824
No, you can't!

338
00:29:41,004 --> 00:29:44,874
Wait! You're buying all these on credit?

339
00:29:44,874 --> 00:29:46,674
It's alright

340
00:29:46,674 --> 00:29:49,034
It's alright? But you never pay me back!

341
00:29:59,414 --> 00:30:00,684
Let's give them a hand

342
00:30:08,464 --> 00:30:13,524
That old drunkard Mouna Rudo
really can't take it anymore?

343
00:30:40,154 --> 00:30:46,154
I'll ask the young men to get ready
before they all get dead drunk

344
00:30:48,734 --> 00:30:52,174
Young man, how dare you tell me these

345
00:30:52,174 --> 00:30:55,694
in front of the police station!

346
00:31:05,754 --> 00:31:07,044
Good morning!

347
00:31:08,924 --> 00:31:10,924
Pihu Sapu?

348
00:31:10,924 --> 00:31:13,354
What the hell was he up to?

349
00:31:13,354 --> 00:31:16,384
That crazy boy spells nothing but trouble

350
00:31:17,064 --> 00:31:21,804
But we'd be bored around here
without him, won't we?

351
00:31:21,804 --> 00:31:24,094
You call making troubles interesting?

352
00:31:33,544 --> 00:31:36,374
Tado, look! Only the gun barrel is left

353
00:31:39,184 --> 00:31:42,344
No, I won't do it -Won't do it?

354
00:31:43,654 --> 00:31:45,194
Chief Dahdo..

355
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,424
the chiefs of the other clans
have all agreed to join us

356
00:31:47,764 --> 00:31:49,424
and everything is ready now

357
00:31:49,424 --> 00:31:52,394
Fighting the Japanese will lead us to death only

358
00:31:53,094 --> 00:31:55,704
We've had three chiefs in our family
that died of fighting the Japanese

359
00:31:55,704 --> 00:31:59,734
Now we've stooped to bring you kids up

360
00:31:59,734 --> 00:32:04,414
to carry on the lifeline of our people
not to get killed on the battlefield

361
00:32:04,414 --> 00:32:06,544
Chief... -We're not afraid of death

362
00:32:06,544 --> 00:32:09,184
Even Chief Mouna agreed to do it

363
00:32:09,184 --> 00:32:12,554
Chief Dahdo, they'll laugh at us if you don't do it

364
00:32:12,554 --> 00:32:15,224
They can laugh at me for all I care

365
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:19,094
I'll never allow our Gungu Clan
to join the battle. Period

366
00:32:19,094 --> 00:32:21,364
But Chief.. -Chief!

367
00:32:21,364 --> 00:32:25,494
Are you going to be a hunter
forever without guns or hunting grounds?

368
00:32:29,764 --> 00:32:33,704
You have no tattoo on your face
Don't forget whom you're talking to

369
00:32:41,214 --> 00:32:42,574
What do we do now?

370
00:32:43,854 --> 00:32:45,784
I can't stand that old man

371
00:32:47,014 --> 00:32:49,354
No way

372
00:32:49,354 --> 00:32:52,324
I won't allow our young clansmen

373
00:32:52,324 --> 00:32:54,594
to sacrifice themselves in vain
with you maniacs

374
00:32:54,594 --> 00:32:59,064
But.. -I won't let out this secret of yours

375
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:00,584
Go home

376
00:33:09,974 --> 00:33:13,674
You only show off your bravery
with those animal skulls now?

377
00:33:14,984 --> 00:33:19,484
Chief Walis, you once fought the Japanese
at Hakaw Supeitei

378
00:33:19,484 --> 00:33:21,884
Where's your bravery now?

379
00:33:23,654 --> 00:33:27,184
Bravery? I gave it all to you long ago

380
00:33:30,834 --> 00:33:34,324
Bring your women and children here
to our Paran Clan

381
00:33:36,104 --> 00:33:38,664
to keep the bloodline of your clan

382
00:33:53,314 --> 00:33:58,914
A clan so big...with so many people..

383
00:34:15,444 --> 00:34:17,644
What are you doing?

384
00:34:17,644 --> 00:34:19,234
Hello, sir!

385
00:34:20,944 --> 00:34:23,074
Come closer

386
00:34:24,754 --> 00:34:27,184
Stop fooling around!
Go home and clean your places up

387
00:34:28,254 --> 00:34:29,054
Yes, sir

388
00:34:31,624 --> 00:34:33,154
Go on!

389
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,624
Sorry

390
00:34:35,694 --> 00:34:37,934
Stay away, kids

391
00:34:37,934 --> 00:34:39,394
Okay, ready

392
00:34:39,394 --> 00:34:41,694
One, two, three

393
00:34:49,374 --> 00:34:51,244
I'm not going in

394
00:34:52,044 --> 00:34:53,844
Make me proud in tomorrow's games

395
00:34:53,844 --> 00:34:56,614
Can you stay with us, Father?

396
00:34:57,384 --> 00:35:02,554
No, I can't. I have to go back before dark

397
00:35:02,554 --> 00:35:07,324
You're spending the night here
Be a good boy, you hear?

398
00:35:07,324 --> 00:35:08,484
See you then

399
00:35:10,894 --> 00:35:12,924
Bye -Take care

400
00:35:17,734 --> 00:35:18,934
Let's go!

401
00:35:58,444 --> 00:35:59,634
Excuse me!

402
00:36:07,284 --> 00:36:12,954
Mouna knows everything about battles

403
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:16,594
But I'm old. I can't go with him

404
00:36:16,594 --> 00:36:21,054
But..
-But our Drodux Clan won't be absent in this

405
00:36:22,664 --> 00:36:25,364
Do I have to say it again in Japanese?

406
00:36:26,104 --> 00:36:28,974
Good morning!

407
00:36:28,974 --> 00:36:31,774
Pihu! What's wrong with you?

408
00:36:33,344 --> 00:36:34,334
Pihu!

409
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,644
Good morning!

410
00:37:06,174 --> 00:37:09,704
Why did you get all our hounds
to bark like crazy?

411
00:37:11,684 --> 00:37:15,174
Chief Mouna, didn't you say
that you wouldn't do it?

412
00:37:17,054 --> 00:37:19,794
Do what? Who says I'm doing anything?

413
00:37:19,794 --> 00:37:22,394
Dakis, you're nothing
but a police dog wearing a collar

414
00:37:22,394 --> 00:37:24,534
Did your master send you here
as a persuader?

415
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:25,554
-Tado!

416
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:48,954
Dakis, you haven't answered
my question from last time

417
00:37:50,794 --> 00:37:53,754
When you die,
are you entering a Japanese shrine

418
00:37:53,754 --> 00:37:56,424
or the heavenly home of our ancestors?

419
00:37:59,294 --> 00:38:02,934
Are you Dakis? Or Hanaoka Ichiro?

420
00:38:02,934 --> 00:38:05,634
I'm a true Seediq tribesman. I am!

421
00:38:05,634 --> 00:38:07,074
But...
-If you are, take off your uniform

422
00:38:07,074 --> 00:38:09,544
and offer blood sacrifice to our ancestors
with us tomorrow

423
00:38:12,414 --> 00:38:16,314
You know well
how many soldiers the Japanese have

424
00:38:16,944 --> 00:38:21,284
You're going to get killed for nothing

425
00:38:22,924 --> 00:38:27,224
You told me the other day that there are
more Japanese people than..

426
00:38:27,224 --> 00:38:30,664
There are more Japanese people
than the tree leaves in the forest

427
00:38:30,664 --> 00:38:33,494
than the pebbles in Jhuoshuei River

428
00:38:33,494 --> 00:38:38,454
But my determination to fight them
is more adamant than Mt. Chilai

429
00:38:41,074 --> 00:38:45,714
If your civilization wants us to cringe

430
00:38:45,714 --> 00:38:51,214
I'll show you the pride of savages

431
00:38:51,214 --> 00:38:53,814
The true Seediq tribesmen

432
00:38:55,724 --> 00:38:57,324
Listen carefully, Dakis

433
00:38:57,324 --> 00:39:03,564
You being a Seediq descendant
who never tried to understand yourself

434
00:39:03,564 --> 00:39:07,034
A Seediq Bale can lose his body

435
00:39:07,034 --> 00:39:10,534
but he fights to keep his soul at all cost

436
00:39:10,534 --> 00:39:13,834
A Seediq who loses his soul

437
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:16,704
will be forsaken by our ancestors' spirits

438
00:39:17,744 --> 00:39:19,304
Do you understand..

439
00:39:20,544 --> 00:39:22,744
..my child?

440
00:39:40,394 --> 00:39:45,664
There are over 130 guns
in the Wushe substation

441
00:39:47,644 --> 00:39:50,704
and many boxes of ammunition too

442
00:39:50,704 --> 00:39:52,914
On the sports day tomorrow

443
00:39:52,914 --> 00:39:57,654
Jiro...Dakis Nawi will be on duty

444
00:39:57,654 --> 00:39:59,984
I'll tell him everything beforehand

445
00:40:23,804 --> 00:40:26,744
Father, will he betray us?

446
00:40:26,744 --> 00:40:28,374
No, he won't

447
00:40:30,284 --> 00:40:33,774
Can't believe all the gunpowder
I spent years collecting will go to waste

448
00:40:34,954 --> 00:40:38,924
What is it, Pihu? -They're all cowards!

449
00:40:38,924 --> 00:40:41,794
Chief, only six clans are willing to join us

450
00:40:41,794 --> 00:40:44,834
A little more than 300 men in all
-300 men?

451
00:40:44,834 --> 00:40:46,134
I tried so hard to persuade them

452
00:40:46,134 --> 00:40:48,004
I was so incensed that
I nearly drew my machete

453
00:40:48,004 --> 00:40:50,124
But they... -Take it easy

454
00:40:50,834 --> 00:40:51,504
Chief..

455
00:40:51,504 --> 00:40:54,944
It's quite enough to have 300. Go home quietly

456
00:40:54,944 --> 00:40:57,634
Don't get caught before action
-Chief..

457
00:41:03,984 --> 00:41:06,814
Get out of here. All of you

458
00:41:08,354 --> 00:41:09,584
Get out!

459
00:41:17,294 --> 00:41:27,774
(Why do men belittle women so?)

460
00:41:27,774 --> 00:41:32,544
(Don't forget all the pride you boast of)

461
00:41:32,544 --> 00:41:38,254
(comes from us women)

462
00:41:38,254 --> 00:41:44,554
(lt is us who weave your glory)

463
00:41:44,554 --> 00:41:50,224
(lt is us women behind men's tattoos of bravery)

464
00:42:22,464 --> 00:42:23,724
The sun..

465
00:42:27,364 --> 00:42:30,304
(l'm on my way)

466
00:42:30,304 --> 00:42:34,604
(to the heavenly home of our ancestors)

467
00:42:39,944 --> 00:42:45,814
(We'll be back as brothers)

468
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:48,954
(Hark!)

469
00:42:48,954 --> 00:42:52,254
(Behold!)

470
00:42:52,254 --> 00:42:58,034
(My soul fights in the falling leaves)

471
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:03,734
(l am Mouna Rudo)

472
00:43:08,774 --> 00:43:14,644
(l bring home the innocent souls)

473
00:43:14,644 --> 00:43:17,544
(Young warriors)

474
00:43:17,544 --> 00:43:20,554
(No one can defeat us)

475
00:43:20,554 --> 00:43:23,454
(Oh, our warriors)

476
00:43:23,454 --> 00:43:28,954
(much like the budding pine leaves)

477
00:44:34,594 --> 00:44:39,864
You don't think I know
what you men are up to, do you?

478
00:44:46,234 --> 00:44:49,004
I'm the chief's daughter

479
00:44:49,004 --> 00:44:53,874
Wherever you're going
the children and I will follow

480
00:44:56,684 --> 00:44:59,844
Your job is to guard this firepan
and keep the fire burning

481
00:45:02,984 --> 00:45:06,924
When it's time to leave
I'll take you along with me

482
00:45:40,924 --> 00:45:42,624
Yamada!

483
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:53,104
Sugiura, get out of there!

484
00:45:55,004 --> 00:45:57,944
Come on, coward
-Who is it? What's going on?

485
00:45:57,944 --> 00:45:59,634
What's going on?

486
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:04,084
Stop! Who is it?

487
00:46:04,084 --> 00:46:06,604
Baso, what the hell?

488
00:46:07,554 --> 00:46:10,584
What the hell are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

489
00:46:10,584 --> 00:46:12,144
Shut up!

490
00:46:18,964 --> 00:46:24,734
(Do you know who l am?)

491
00:46:24,734 --> 00:46:30,204
(l'm Tado Mouna, a true warrior)

492
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:43,584
(When you bleed, the animosity)
(between you and me no longer exists)

493
00:46:43,584 --> 00:46:49,794
(l'm a true warrior)

494
00:46:49,794 --> 00:46:56,464
(l'm a Seediq Bale, a true warrior)

495
00:46:56,464 --> 00:47:04,344
(Your soul is welcome to dwell with me)

496
00:47:04,344 --> 00:47:07,914
(l'll feed you with millet wine and foods)

497
00:47:07,914 --> 00:47:11,654
(There's no longer hatred between us)

498
00:47:11,654 --> 00:47:26,964
(When you bleed, the animosity)
(between you and me no longer exists)

499
00:47:26,964 --> 00:47:34,644
(You'll be with our ancestors' spirits)

500
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:49,614
(to watch over my people)

501
00:47:51,354 --> 00:47:54,524
Lubi, keep the fire burning

502
00:47:54,524 --> 00:47:56,924
I'll be home before dark

503
00:48:46,914 --> 00:48:51,554
Women! Children! Why aren't you singing?

504
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:52,384
Sing!

505
00:48:53,714 --> 00:48:54,814
Sing!

506
00:48:58,494 --> 00:48:59,284
Mouna!

507
00:49:00,124 --> 00:49:01,724
My old friend!

508
00:49:01,724 --> 00:49:04,854
Mouna! Chief Mouna!

509
00:49:05,564 --> 00:49:08,464
Shut up!

510
00:49:10,504 --> 00:49:11,934
Not you

511
00:49:13,974 --> 00:49:17,334
Tanah, split your men into two teams

512
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:24,144
You lead one team along Bkasan River
to annihilate all the police stations

513
00:49:24,144 --> 00:49:27,854
and cut off the communication
of the Japanese to the east

514
00:49:27,854 --> 00:49:32,294
The other team follows me to Gungu Clan
to meet up with other clans

515
00:49:33,994 --> 00:49:37,584
What do we do
after those police stations are annihilated?

516
00:49:39,794 --> 00:49:44,134
After that? Come to Mehebu Clan for a drink

517
00:49:48,844 --> 00:49:50,134
Chief Mouna!

518
00:49:51,174 --> 00:49:53,674
Where are they? Aren't they here yet?

519
00:49:53,674 --> 00:49:54,884
They're all here

520
00:49:54,884 --> 00:49:59,054
but Chief Dahdo doesn't allow
our Gungu Clan to join in the battle

521
00:49:59,054 --> 00:50:01,954
Everyone's trying to convince him

522
00:50:01,954 --> 00:50:04,384
Have all the police stations been annihilated?

523
00:50:04,384 --> 00:50:05,794
We've burned down every one of them

524
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:08,094
Then why waste our time persuading him?

525
00:50:08,094 --> 00:50:09,494
I said no

526
00:50:09,494 --> 00:50:12,564
Our clan is big. We must join in

527
00:50:12,564 --> 00:50:13,664
Chief Dahdo..

528
00:50:13,664 --> 00:50:16,334
even a boar fights back when driven to bay
Why don't you understand?

529
00:50:16,334 --> 00:50:19,634
I'd rather be punished by the Japanese
than have our whole clan wiped out

530
00:50:19,634 --> 00:50:24,644
My children, don't you remember
how your fathers died?

531
00:50:24,644 --> 00:50:26,544
No one from our Gungu Clan is allowed to go

532
00:50:26,544 --> 00:50:29,644
Are you frightened to death by the Japanese?
Or are you spoiled by them?

533
00:50:29,644 --> 00:50:31,174
Chief! Chief Mouna!

534
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:35,284
You know well
that we're bound to lose this battle

535
00:50:35,284 --> 00:50:37,184
Why do you insist on fighting it?

536
00:50:37,184 --> 00:50:38,654
Because of our ancestral spirit
that's soon to be forgotten

537
00:50:39,694 --> 00:50:40,924
Look at these young men

538
00:50:40,924 --> 00:50:44,964
Their faces are clean without the Seediq tattoos

539
00:50:44,964 --> 00:50:48,564
Do you want to see their souls
forsaken by our ancestors' spirits?

540
00:50:48,564 --> 00:50:50,404
Or don't you think they're qualified

541
00:50:50,404 --> 00:50:52,734
to be Seediq Bale
with hands stained with blood?

542
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,074
Ancestral spirit?

543
00:50:59,074 --> 00:51:00,334
Ancestral spirit!

544
00:51:02,584 --> 00:51:05,714
You want to sacrifice their lives
in exchange for these tattoos

545
00:51:05,714 --> 00:51:07,654
but what does it take to get
these young lives back?

546
00:51:09,224 --> 00:51:11,384
Pride!

547
00:51:23,604 --> 00:51:24,934
Let's go!

548
00:51:36,944 --> 00:51:39,474
Let's go!

549
00:52:05,274 --> 00:52:10,074
Mr. Inspector, look! Here comes the mist!

550
00:52:15,784 --> 00:52:17,584
What a beautiful sight!

551
00:52:22,364 --> 00:52:25,294
Here comes your brother. Good luck!

552
00:52:26,134 --> 00:52:27,824
Good luck!

553
00:52:30,164 --> 00:52:33,034
What a thick mist!

554
00:52:33,034 --> 00:52:35,904
Yeah, it's often misty around here

555
00:52:35,904 --> 00:52:41,174
But with a mist so thick
how will they judge the games?

556
00:52:41,174 --> 00:52:45,154
Those games are just for kids
Having fun is all that matters

557
00:52:45,154 --> 00:52:47,954
Come on, have more hot tea. It's chilly

558
00:52:47,954 --> 00:52:49,354
Thank you

559
00:52:49,354 --> 00:52:52,724
We still have time for a rest

560
00:52:54,494 --> 00:52:57,394
Be careful! -I'm sorry

561
00:52:58,864 --> 00:53:01,454
Are you alright? -Yeah, thank you

562
00:53:21,484 --> 00:53:24,854
Let's do it. There's no turning back

563
00:53:28,694 --> 00:53:30,864
My children..

564
00:53:30,864 --> 00:53:33,594
at the other end of the rainbow
in the heavenly home of our ancestors

565
00:53:33,594 --> 00:53:36,494
lies a fertile hunting ground

566
00:53:37,634 --> 00:53:39,834
Our ancestors are all there

567
00:53:40,704 --> 00:53:44,274
Only brave souls are allowed to enter

568
00:53:44,274 --> 00:53:46,514
It's the one hunting ground
we cannot afford to lose

569
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:48,204
Fellow tribesmen!

570
00:53:49,584 --> 00:53:54,284
My fellow tribesmen!
Let's hunt the heads of our enemies

571
00:53:54,284 --> 00:53:58,424
We can no longer keep the hunting ground
in the Wushe mountains

572
00:53:58,424 --> 00:54:01,764
Let's wash our souls clean with blood

573
00:54:01,764 --> 00:54:05,594
Stride over the rainbow
to our eternal hunting ground

574
00:54:21,374 --> 00:54:24,404
We're offering a blood sacrifice to our ancestors

575
00:54:26,284 --> 00:54:31,814
Young men, let our ancestors' spirits
be possessed in your blades

576
00:54:33,324 --> 00:54:36,954
Entrust your hatred to the clouds and mists

577
00:54:42,804 --> 00:54:45,494
Let's do it

578
00:54:46,004 --> 00:54:48,874
Be still! How many times do I have to tell you?

579
00:54:50,874 --> 00:54:52,304
Go to the back of the line!

580
00:55:30,944 --> 00:55:33,714
No, it's not what you think

581
00:55:33,714 --> 00:55:35,014
Hello?

582
00:55:35,014 --> 00:55:36,384
Really?

583
00:55:36,384 --> 00:55:39,824
How fair-spoken you are!
-No, you're too kind

584
00:55:40,624 --> 00:55:42,024
Hatsuko!

585
00:55:42,024 --> 00:55:45,054
What the hell! Lower you voice

586
00:55:46,864 --> 00:55:47,964
Hanaoka?

587
00:55:47,964 --> 00:55:50,404
It's your shift at the ammunition storage

588
00:55:54,704 --> 00:55:55,634
Hello

589
00:55:58,674 --> 00:56:00,144
Your candies

590
00:56:00,144 --> 00:56:01,814
Thank you

591
00:56:01,814 --> 00:56:03,644
Thank you

592
00:56:04,884 --> 00:56:06,554
Hanako!

593
00:56:06,554 --> 00:56:08,214
Hello -Hello

594
00:56:08,214 --> 00:56:09,844
Wow! You bought candies

595
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,844
So cute

596
00:56:16,764 --> 00:56:19,794
Come on, let's go. Bye!

597
00:56:19,794 --> 00:56:21,284
Bye!

598
00:56:47,094 --> 00:56:48,584
It's Ichiro!

599
00:56:52,634 --> 00:56:56,134
Welcome! You've come a long way

600
00:56:56,134 --> 00:56:58,724
This way please -Thank you

601
00:57:06,774 --> 00:57:09,384
It's spectacular

602
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:10,874
All rise!

603
00:57:16,384 --> 00:57:18,084
Be quiet!

604
00:57:20,154 --> 00:57:22,454
Sing the national anthem

605
00:57:30,634 --> 00:57:32,624
Sing the national anthem

606
00:57:46,414 --> 00:57:56,724
(Our Mikado rules the world)

607
00:57:56,724 --> 00:58:05,404
(For generations to come)

608
00:58:05,404 --> 00:58:10,204
(Like sands accumulating to rocks)

609
00:58:20,554 --> 00:58:21,544
Get him!

610
00:58:22,524 --> 00:58:23,384
Stop!

611
00:58:24,384 --> 00:58:25,724
Stop!

612
00:58:25,724 --> 00:58:27,854
What's going on?

613
00:58:28,124 --> 00:58:30,324
Keep playing! Come on!

614
00:58:30,324 --> 00:58:31,814
Sing! Keep singing!

615
00:58:32,434 --> 00:58:33,724
Keep singing!

616
00:58:34,894 --> 00:58:36,384
Play it!

617
00:58:37,064 --> 00:58:38,664
Keep singing!

618
00:58:38,774 --> 00:58:42,504
(Like sands accumulating to rocks)

619
00:58:43,804 --> 00:58:45,364
Get him!

620
00:59:22,844 --> 00:59:24,414
Here comes the blood sacrifice!

621
00:59:24,414 --> 00:59:26,404
Come on!

622
00:59:44,904 --> 00:59:46,874
Run! Come on!

623
01:00:25,414 --> 01:00:27,674
Hatsuko! Hatsuko!

624
01:00:41,924 --> 01:00:43,484
Hatsuko!

625
01:01:06,054 --> 01:01:09,044
Come on! Unlock the storage
The savages are hunting heads

626
01:01:10,454 --> 01:01:12,044
Hanaoka!

627
01:01:14,954 --> 01:01:17,824
Unlock that one too!

628
01:01:18,364 --> 01:01:23,004
Chief Mouna, my wife Obing
is still dressed in kimono

629
01:01:23,004 --> 01:01:25,294
Shut up! Open the door!

630
01:01:28,944 --> 01:01:30,734
Run for your lives!

631
01:01:32,274 --> 01:01:34,174
I'm a descendant from a samurai as well

632
01:01:36,444 --> 01:01:37,584
Mr. Satsuka! -Mr. Commissioner!

633
01:01:37,584 --> 01:01:39,084
Mr. Satsuka! -Come on!

634
01:01:39,084 --> 01:01:40,384
Mr. Satsuka!

635
01:01:48,254 --> 01:01:49,524
Hide in there! Be quiet!

636
01:01:49,524 --> 01:01:51,994
Hush! Be quiet!

637
01:01:54,494 --> 01:01:58,264
Aren't you a savage too?
Why are you hiding with us?

638
01:02:36,074 --> 01:02:39,004
We're offering blood sacrifice
What are you daydreaming for?

639
01:02:46,084 --> 01:02:47,354
Follow me!

640
01:02:47,354 --> 01:02:50,014
Pawan! Pawan!

641
01:03:00,334 --> 01:03:03,164
Come on! Hurry up!

642
01:03:19,814 --> 01:03:22,044
Missed! Come on!

643
01:03:25,954 --> 01:03:28,454
Damned Japanese! I'll make you weep!

644
01:03:28,454 --> 01:03:30,124
Come with me!

645
01:03:43,544 --> 01:03:52,584
(Oh, my children, l know)

646
01:03:52,584 --> 01:04:02,754
(ln those passionate days)

647
