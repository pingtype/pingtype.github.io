Mouna! Take it easy!

3
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:19,607
A good hunter waits patiently

4
00:00:21,378 --> 00:00:22,817
Out of the way! Let me do it!

5
00:01:02,288 --> 00:01:03,847
Move!

6
00:01:07,028 --> 00:01:09,217
Mouna! Mouna!

7
00:01:10,868 --> 00:01:14,727
Mouna, be careful!

8
00:01:40,998 --> 00:01:43,057
Mouna!

9
00:01:43,058 --> 00:01:45,597
Mouna,
here come the Bununs from Kntabang Clan!

10
00:01:45,598 --> 00:01:48,637
Let's go! Come on!

11
00:01:48,638 --> 00:01:49,897
Come on, let's go! Leave the boar!

12
00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:52,457
There he is!

13
00:01:55,578 --> 00:01:57,097
Kill him!

14
00:02:18,328 --> 00:02:20,027
Mouna, get down!

15
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:44,617
Over there!

16
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:47,987
Mouna is over there! -Shoot him!

17
00:02:53,438 --> 00:02:54,727
Come on! Hurry!

18
00:03:01,838 --> 00:03:05,177
Listen to me! My name is Mouna Rudo!

19
00:03:05,178 --> 00:03:08,237
Be alert when you hear this name again!

20
00:04:04,038 --> 00:04:05,407
Who?

21
00:04:05,408 --> 00:04:06,767
Who becomes the hero?

22
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:08,907
Who is it?

23
00:04:08,908 --> 00:04:10,307
Your Mouna is back!

24
00:04:11,308 --> 00:04:15,677
It's your Mouna! He's back!

25
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:19,118
It's Mouna!

26
00:04:19,118 --> 00:04:22,107
Mouna is a true man now

27
00:04:25,358 --> 00:04:26,727
Mouna is back!

28
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:28,527
Well done, Mouna!

29
00:04:28,528 --> 00:04:30,517
A true man is back!

30
00:04:32,068 --> 00:04:35,057
The hero is back!

31
00:04:49,348 --> 00:04:50,617
Mouna..

32
00:04:50,618 --> 00:04:53,787
you've offered blood sacrifice
to our ancestors' spirits

33
00:04:53,788 --> 00:04:58,017
I hereby tattoo the marks of manhood
on your face

34
00:04:58,628 --> 00:05:00,797
From now on..

35
00:05:00,798 --> 00:05:04,327
you shall abide by our ancestral spirit

36
00:05:04,328 --> 00:05:06,427
to guard our clan and our hunting grounds

37
00:05:06,428 --> 00:05:09,067
to guard our clan and our hunting grounds

38
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:11,807
On the rainbow bridge

39
00:05:11,808 --> 00:05:14,067
our ancestors' spirits await the reunion
with your valiant soul

40
00:05:20,548 --> 00:05:26,317
Warriors of The Rainbow I : Sun Flag

41
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,547
(In 1895)

42
00:05:31,588 --> 00:05:33,927
(the island of Taiwan was ceded to Japan)

43
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,947
(under the Treaty of Shimonoseki
between Japan and China)

44
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:26,547
The island of Taiwan
is the new territory of our empire

45
00:06:26,548 --> 00:06:31,987
yet to receive our Mikado's grace

46
00:06:31,988 --> 00:06:35,857
The islanders are warlike innately

47
00:06:35,858 --> 00:06:41,297
It's said that they're armed to fight us

48
00:06:41,298 --> 00:06:46,167
but they're a scattered bunch,
nothing to be afraid of

49
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:49,297
Once disembarked at Keelung Port

50
00:06:49,298 --> 00:06:54,867
we must sweep the entire island with force

51
00:07:01,418 --> 00:07:06,547
We must prevent any disrespect
from the people

52
00:07:07,658 --> 00:07:14,717
so as to gain their wholehearted allegiance
to our empire of the sun

53
00:07:16,928 --> 00:07:23,297
Especially the heartland of Taiwan
occupied by the tribal savages

54
00:07:26,768 --> 00:07:33,377
There are ample resources
of lumber and mines in the mountains

55
00:07:33,378 --> 00:07:36,777
Endless treasures..

56
00:07:46,428 --> 00:07:53,227
Father, last night I dreamt of a deer
with white spots around its eyes..

57
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:04,847
Sisin babblers are singing an auspicious song

58
00:08:04,848 --> 00:08:08,337
Go ahead and hunt the deer in your dream

59
00:08:09,618 --> 00:08:12,747
...for your own wedding

60
00:08:21,898 --> 00:08:24,457
Wait! Hold on!

61
00:08:30,808 --> 00:08:31,827
Hold on!

62
00:08:33,978 --> 00:08:34,777
Charge!

63
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:35,707
Hold on!

64
00:08:38,578 --> 00:08:39,977
Charge!

65
00:08:42,518 --> 00:08:43,777
Let's kill them!

66
00:10:29,718 --> 00:10:32,247
That was the deer in my dream

67
00:11:33,848 --> 00:11:36,057
Listen to me!

68
00:11:36,058 --> 00:11:39,647
Dance! Let's dance!

69
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,887
Everyone Dance!

70
00:11:44,028 --> 00:11:47,867
Come and dance, my in-law!

71
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:52,667
Come on, everyone! Let's dance!

72
00:11:52,668 --> 00:11:55,037
This is my son Mouna Rudo

73
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:58,707
The bravest and strongest warrior
in Mehebu Clan

74
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:03,317
He'll be an unparalleled chief

75
00:12:03,318 --> 00:12:07,657
You're wise to marry your daughter to him

76
00:12:07,658 --> 00:12:11,487
Dance! Let's dance!

77
00:12:11,488 --> 00:12:14,927
Let's cheer for them!

78
00:12:14,928 --> 00:12:17,987
Be joyful, everyone!

79
00:12:22,568 --> 00:12:24,107
Out of the way!

80
00:12:24,108 --> 00:12:26,097
Stand clear of the path please

81
00:12:29,008 --> 00:12:32,067
Out of the way! Please!

82
00:12:33,348 --> 00:12:35,207
Out of the way!

83
00:12:38,248 --> 00:12:42,347
Out of the way! Move!

84
00:12:45,988 --> 00:12:48,257
Out of the way please!

85
00:13:15,018 --> 00:13:16,317
Hey, my old friend!

86
00:13:19,058 --> 00:13:21,817
Oh no! It's him again

87
00:13:22,558 --> 00:13:23,497
My old friend!

88
00:13:28,298 --> 00:13:30,597
You from Mehebu Clan! Over here!

89
00:13:31,568 --> 00:13:32,327
Over here!

90
00:13:41,948 --> 00:13:42,967
Hey, boss!

91
00:13:45,788 --> 00:13:46,777
Come

92
00:13:55,028 --> 00:13:58,667
Must you wear such a big head
on that small head of yours?

93
00:13:58,668 --> 00:14:00,327
My old friend!

94
00:14:09,178 --> 00:14:10,107
Mouna?

95
00:14:14,678 --> 00:14:16,907
Seediqs from Toda
-You from Tnbarah Clan, over here!

96
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,847
Hey, young man, don't you make trouble here

97
00:14:28,528 --> 00:14:32,627
The tallest one is Mouna Rudo
of Mehebu Clan from Tgdaya

98
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:15,107
You've come all the way here
with so little meat for exchange?

99
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:17,667
Those of you from Toda are so shameless

100
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:20,837
Why don't you offer your
hunting grounds to us for free?

101
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:28,057
Mouna Rudo, don't be too proud
I'm not afraid of you

102
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:29,657
Mouna Rudo, I'm Temu Walis

103
00:15:29,658 --> 00:15:31,847
I'll cut your head off when I grow up

104
00:15:46,838 --> 00:15:49,207
Temu Walis?

105
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,467
You won't have the chance to grow up

106
00:16:04,118 --> 00:16:06,017
Is that Temu Cire?

107
00:16:07,088 --> 00:16:09,127
No, it's Temu Walis

108
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:11,728
I mean that grown-up man

109
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:13,998
I don't know. Not someone famous, I guess

110
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:28,447
Gather up, young men!

111
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:31,517
Come on! Bring your weapons!

112
00:16:31,518 --> 00:16:34,247
Come with us! Quick!

113
00:16:36,058 --> 00:16:37,457
Put these away!

114
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:44,388
Quick! All young men come with us!

115
00:17:09,518 --> 00:17:10,547
Run!

116
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:24,798
Temu!

117
00:17:39,348 --> 00:17:40,377
Mouna!

118
00:17:45,288 --> 00:17:46,217
Mouna!

119
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,347
Mouna, he's one of our own

120
00:18:10,018 --> 00:18:14,387
No one can ever run ahead of me, you hear?

121
00:18:21,128 --> 00:18:22,897
Come on, Labay!

122
00:18:22,898 --> 00:18:24,227
Are you alright?

123
00:18:36,308 --> 00:18:38,397
Laying railway tracks?

124
00:18:40,278 --> 00:18:43,437
It's no easy task in the mountains

125
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:47,917
In order to harvest the natural resources
in those forests

126
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,617
we need to have proper transportation

127
00:18:50,618 --> 00:18:51,587
Yeah

128
00:18:52,658 --> 00:18:56,097
It's a shame to leave
those resources undeveloped

129
00:18:56,098 --> 00:18:59,127
but those savages up there..

130
00:18:59,128 --> 00:19:00,797
Sir?

131
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:02,537
Here she is, sir

132
00:19:02,538 --> 00:19:07,937
She dares not lead you past Hakaw Supeitei,
Captain

133
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,977
She'll spend the night in her father's house
in Meisi

134
00:19:10,978 --> 00:19:15,377
She won't accompany you to
the hunting grounds of other clans

135
00:19:20,818 --> 00:19:22,377
Much obliged

136
00:19:29,258 --> 00:19:30,197
Let's go!

137
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,547
Captain?

138
00:19:46,548 --> 00:19:49,017
Those savages in the mountains
are rather ferocious

139
00:19:49,018 --> 00:19:51,477
Please be careful!

140
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:03,157
Hey!

141
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:05,498
Hey, it's your turn now

142
00:21:08,758 --> 00:21:11,527
Wow! How beautiful!

143
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,367
Yes, indeed

144
00:21:17,168 --> 00:21:18,637
It was so dark last night

145
00:21:18,638 --> 00:21:22,297
that we didn't notice we're surrounded
by cherry blossom trees

146
00:21:22,678 --> 00:21:23,607
Cherry blossoms?

147
00:21:26,448 --> 00:21:27,567
They really are cherry blossoms

148
00:21:34,248 --> 00:21:35,407
It's so red

149
00:21:39,388 --> 00:21:41,257
Red as blood

150
00:22:02,078 --> 00:22:03,847
Blockade the entire Wushe region

151
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:08,118
Ban all trading between the Hans
and the Wushe savages

152
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,248
Yes, sir

153
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,447
Back off!

154
00:22:36,448 --> 00:22:39,607
Put down your weapons! Go up there!

155
00:22:42,088 --> 00:22:44,077
Hurry up!

156
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:55,058
Come on!

157
00:23:36,078 --> 00:23:37,537
It's an ambush! Watch out!

158
00:23:43,248 --> 00:23:45,047
Hide there! Quick!

159
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,137
They're up there!

160
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,218
Uwe! Uwe!

161
00:23:50,218 --> 00:23:52,417
Retreat!

162
00:24:04,768 --> 00:24:07,097
There's no way out!

163
00:24:15,548 --> 00:24:17,417
These intruders are out of their minds

164
00:24:17,418 --> 00:24:19,617
How dare they show up at my doorstep

165
00:24:19,618 --> 00:24:21,087
Throw them down!

166
00:24:36,568 --> 00:24:39,627
Get out of here! Quick!

167
00:24:50,918 --> 00:24:52,607
Hurry up!

168
00:24:53,648 --> 00:24:55,277
Follow me!

169
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:44,738
I see. I see

170
00:25:47,868 --> 00:25:49,237
I see

171
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:51,837
(A Short Account of Taiwan)

172
00:26:18,069 --> 00:26:21,438
Give me their biggest enemy

173
00:26:28,848 --> 00:26:29,907
There they are!

174
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,237
Hello

175
00:26:49,238 --> 00:26:50,567
Hello

176
00:26:54,508 --> 00:26:55,627
Here

177
00:26:57,338 --> 00:27:01,247
The intruders don't allow
the Hans to deal with us

178
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:05,747
But we can deal with you, can't we?

179
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,048
Idiots!

180
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:12,677
Bring me the wine!

181
00:27:18,328 --> 00:27:20,417
Bring the wine!

182
00:27:21,328 --> 00:27:22,027
Drink!

183
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:30,307
Look! I'm Mouna Rudo

184
00:27:30,308 --> 00:27:32,397
I killed at Hakaw Supeitei a chief
of the intruders

185
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:35,077
Mouna Rudo?

186
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:37,318
You're Mouna Rudo?

187
00:27:37,318 --> 00:27:39,907
Yes, I am

188
00:27:41,288 --> 00:27:43,717
Mouna Rudo!

189
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:07,638
Chief? Chief?

190
00:28:15,688 --> 00:28:18,277
Where is Mouna Rudo?

191
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:27,727
I couldn't get him drunk

192
00:29:30,528 --> 00:29:32,427
Wake up!

193
00:29:32,428 --> 00:29:35,397
Those Bununs from Kntabang Clan
are hunting heads

194
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,727
Get up! Let's go!

195
00:29:41,138 --> 00:29:43,737
Let's get out of here! Hurry!

196
00:29:53,718 --> 00:29:57,617
All the human beings on this land

197
00:29:57,618 --> 00:30:01,857
The gods bestow upon us a mortal life

198
00:30:01,858 --> 00:30:05,997
But we are true men indeed

199
00:30:05,998 --> 00:30:11,667
A true man dies in the battlefield

200
00:30:11,668 --> 00:30:16,707
and he strides to the heavenly home
of our ancestors

201
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:24,777
There lies a fertile hunting ground

202
00:30:24,778 --> 00:30:32,087
that can only be guarded by a qualified true man

203
00:30:33,788 --> 00:30:37,857
When he arrives at the heavenly home
of our ancestors

204
00:30:37,858 --> 00:30:42,367
he'll come across a beautiful rainbow bridge

205
00:30:42,368 --> 00:30:47,507
The ancestors' spirits guarding it say.

206
00:30:47,508 --> 00:30:50,707
''Let's take a look at your hands''

207
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:53,647
When the man opens his hands

208
00:30:53,648 --> 00:31:01,547
we see bloodstains that can never be wiped clean

209
00:31:01,548 --> 00:31:05,247
''Now you're a true man indeed!''
says our ancestors' spirits

210
00:31:10,629 --> 00:31:13,668
Come out, guys!

211
00:31:13,668 --> 00:31:16,737
Bring your weapons!

212
00:31:16,738 --> 00:31:18,667
Come on!

213
00:31:19,968 --> 00:31:25,477
''Go! Go ahead! My hero!''

214
00:31:25,478 --> 00:31:29,747
''Your soul may now enter
the heavenly home of our ancestors

215
00:31:29,748 --> 00:31:36,477
''to guard the hunting ground of honor''

216
00:31:38,318 --> 00:31:40,917
Stop it! It'll never be ignited

217
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:49,597
And a true woman must be good
at weaving red coat of arms for her man

218
00:31:49,598 --> 00:31:54,567
When she reaches the rainbow bridge
she opens her hands

219
00:31:54,568 --> 00:31:59,547
showing her calluses that can never be removed

220
00:31:59,548 --> 00:32:04,847
''Go! Go ahead! You're a true woman''

221
00:32:05,948 --> 00:32:10,857
say the ancestors' spirits
guarding the rainbow bridge

222
00:32:10,858 --> 00:32:14,827
''Your soul may now enter
the heavenly home of our ancestors

223
00:32:14,828 --> 00:32:21,997
''No go weave a rainbow-like dress for yourself!''

224
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:25,057
Be careful! -Over there!

225
00:33:04,508 --> 00:33:07,137
Stop!

226
00:33:30,138 --> 00:33:37,407
A man who's never decapitated an enemy
or a woman who's not good at weaving

227
00:33:37,408 --> 00:33:41,777
is not qualified to have their faces tattooed

228
00:33:41,778 --> 00:33:45,847
Some day, when they're gone

229
00:33:45,848 --> 00:33:50,287
and their souls arrive at the rainbow bridge

230
00:33:50,288 --> 00:33:54,927
the ancestors' spirits guarding it
would see their clean faces and ask.

231
00:33:54,928 --> 00:33:57,287
How dare you bring a machete! Bastard!

232
00:34:00,629 --> 00:34:03,038
''Are these my children?''

233
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:07,007
''Are you my children?''

234
00:34:07,008 --> 00:34:11,777
''Go back! Go back now!''

235
00:34:11,778 --> 00:34:15,947
''You're not true Seediqs''

236
00:34:15,948 --> 00:34:21,977
''You're not qualified to enter
the heavenly home of our ancestors

237
00:34:56,818 --> 00:34:59,057
Run! Come on!

238
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:00,858
Let's get out of here!

239
00:35:10,868 --> 00:35:13,407
Run, Mouna!

240
00:35:13,408 --> 00:35:14,927
Just go!

241
00:35:17,779 --> 00:35:19,748
Rudo, are you alright?

242
00:35:24,218 --> 00:35:25,477
Father!

243
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:29,558
Suddenly, the tribesmen find themselves blowsy

244
00:35:29,558 --> 00:35:33,227
their eyes blank

245
00:35:33,228 --> 00:35:39,167
They turn around in shame
and walk though the rugged valleys

246
00:35:39,169 --> 00:35:43,468
They become wailing ghosts
suffering unbearable pain

247
00:35:43,468 --> 00:35:49,837
from all the cuts
by the poisonous crabs along the creek

248
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,608
Mouna..

249
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:59,277
you must keep the intruders away from our clan

250
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:46,227
Mouna, do you understand?

251
00:36:46,228 --> 00:36:48,727
Abide by our ancestral dictations

252
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:54,297
and be a Seediq Bale (a true man)

253
00:37:21,068 --> 00:37:22,997
Excuse me, sir

254
00:37:22,998 --> 00:37:24,767
Let's see..

255
00:37:24,768 --> 00:37:29,257
The first one from the left is Mouna Rudo
the chief of Mehebu Clan

256
00:37:32,108 --> 00:37:38,517
Those behind him are Ubus and Mouna Sine

257
00:37:40,388 --> 00:37:42,887
Mouna, stop glaring

258
00:37:42,888 --> 00:37:44,317
Look down

259
00:37:47,658 --> 00:37:49,887
Mouna, stop glaring

260
00:37:58,368 --> 00:38:00,237
Ubus..

261
00:38:00,238 --> 00:38:02,797
our ancestors never lost
any of our hunting grounds in the past

262
00:38:04,538 --> 00:38:08,067
I can't believe these intruders
are taking them away from us now

263
00:38:09,718 --> 00:38:12,047
I'll never submit to them

264
00:38:13,548 --> 00:38:15,707
I will never

265
00:38:22,298 --> 00:38:24,787
These are all yours?

266
00:38:29,938 --> 00:38:31,597
I will never!

267
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,467
Mouna!

268
00:38:46,748 --> 00:38:47,777
Stop it!

269
00:38:54,688 --> 00:38:55,957
Mouna!

270
00:38:56,428 --> 00:38:57,357
Mouna!

271
00:39:33,768 --> 00:39:36,667
Hurry up! It's going to rain

272
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,737
Awi!

273
00:39:44,878 --> 00:39:46,237
Awi!

274
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:49,447
What's wrong?

275
00:39:49,448 --> 00:39:51,107
Are you alright?

276
00:39:53,218 --> 00:39:55,117
What's wrong?

277
00:39:55,118 --> 00:39:56,357
Are you alright?

278
00:39:56,358 --> 00:40:00,987
(Wushe, 1930)

279
00:40:04,498 --> 00:40:07,427
Schools, clinics, grocery stores

280
00:40:07,429 --> 00:40:10,868
post offices, hotels, boardinghouses..

281
00:40:10,868 --> 00:40:12,737
We've managed to civilize

282
00:40:12,739 --> 00:40:16,378
all the Wushe savages

283
00:40:16,378 --> 00:40:19,277
It's not an easy task

284
00:40:19,278 --> 00:40:25,377
Hard to imagine that this was once
the most uncivilized heartland here

285
00:40:26,518 --> 00:40:29,687
Carrying logs..

286
00:40:29,688 --> 00:40:32,287
and walking from the lumberyard uphill to here
takes them a whole day, doesn't it?

287
00:40:32,288 --> 00:40:38,797
Don't worry. These savages are strong

288
00:40:38,798 --> 00:40:44,457
And they're more than happy
to earn some money for millet wine

289
00:40:46,008 --> 00:40:47,627
Come on. This way please

290
00:40:50,508 --> 00:40:51,807
Mr. Satsuka,

291
00:40:51,808 --> 00:40:55,107
how long have you been in Wushe?

292
00:40:55,108 --> 00:40:56,947
Over a decade

293
00:40:56,948 --> 00:41:00,387
So you know this region very well?

294
00:41:00,388 --> 00:41:04,217
Of course. My wife is a savage woman

295
00:41:04,218 --> 00:41:06,827
I know this region like the back of my hand
-It's this bone right here

296
00:41:06,828 --> 00:41:08,757
It hurts so much when you press it

297
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:10,098
Right here?

298
00:41:10,098 --> 00:41:11,797
Ah! Easy!

299
00:41:11,798 --> 00:41:13,627
Here! Have a drink!

300
00:41:14,798 --> 00:41:18,867
No more wine for us please. We can't afford it

301
00:41:18,868 --> 00:41:20,967
It's alright

302
00:41:20,968 --> 00:41:24,707
This one's on me

303
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:29,648
You're indeed a beautiful serpent

304
00:41:32,649 --> 00:41:35,248
Every day I carry those damn logs
without getting paid properly

305
00:41:35,249 --> 00:41:37,588
Now I'm so broke that even my hounds
look down on me

306
00:41:38,858 --> 00:41:41,057
We're losing our hunting grounds

307
00:41:41,058 --> 00:41:44,397
and you still keep the hounds
to look down on you?

308
00:41:44,398 --> 00:41:45,197
Look!

309
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:47,527
Those are the trees
that used to watch over our ancestors

310
00:41:47,528 --> 00:41:49,497
This is how they end up

311
00:41:50,868 --> 00:41:54,967
Strange thing is, why so many constructions?

312
00:41:54,968 --> 00:42:00,377
What? Not only do you befriend us with wine
but you speak our language fluently

313
00:42:02,248 --> 00:42:03,677
Hey! It's going to rain

314
00:42:03,678 --> 00:42:07,387
Stop drinking and go home!
-Good morning, sir!

315
00:42:07,389 --> 00:42:09,288
Good morning, Mr. Policeman

316
00:42:11,288 --> 00:42:13,757
You've worked all day long
for such a mean wage

317
00:42:13,758 --> 00:42:17,857
and you waste it on wine?

318
00:42:17,859 --> 00:42:21,628
What else can we do with so little money?

319
00:42:21,628 --> 00:42:24,697
Yeah, right! We're savages, aren't we?

320
00:42:24,698 --> 00:42:27,637
We aren't supposed to know
anything about saving money

321
00:42:27,638 --> 00:42:31,477
Yeah, Mr. Policeman. You're Japanese, sir

322
00:42:31,478 --> 00:42:34,207
You don't know how hard our lives are

323
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:37,817
Only Mr. Wu here understands us

324
00:42:37,818 --> 00:42:40,387
He's a beautiful serpent

325
00:42:40,388 --> 00:42:42,977
He's a viper!

326
00:42:45,488 --> 00:42:47,027
Excuse me -Hello

327
00:42:47,029 --> 00:42:49,258
I'd like some salt, please -No problem

328
00:42:52,898 --> 00:42:57,937
Oh no! It's raining! Hurry up and go home, sir

329
00:42:57,939 --> 00:43:00,868
Or your glorious uniform will be soaking wet

330
00:43:01,868 --> 00:43:03,207
Go ahead!

331
00:43:03,209 --> 00:43:04,638
Go on!

332
00:43:10,748 --> 00:43:12,217
Run, sir!

333
00:43:12,218 --> 00:43:15,237
Your Japanese fur is too precious to spoil

334
00:43:26,268 --> 00:43:27,927
It's raining

335
00:43:27,928 --> 00:43:31,237
Go collect the laundry hanging outside

336
00:43:31,238 --> 00:43:35,437
Can't you tell what needs to be done first?

337
00:43:35,438 --> 00:43:38,877
Hey, come back!
Are you taking the baby out in the rain?

338
00:43:38,878 --> 00:43:40,367
I'm sorry

339
00:43:48,048 --> 00:43:51,417
What an imbecile!

340
00:43:51,418 --> 00:43:53,477
Who'd marry such an idiot like you?

341
00:43:54,458 --> 00:43:55,927
When it rains, it pours

342
00:43:55,928 --> 00:43:57,287
Good morning

343
00:43:58,098 --> 00:44:00,127
This is our policeman Hanaoka Jiro

344
00:44:00,128 --> 00:44:02,967
This is our new police minister Ekawa Hakudo

345
00:44:10,178 --> 00:44:12,577
Jiro is a savage too

346
00:44:36,838 --> 00:44:38,137
Older brother

347
00:44:38,138 --> 00:44:40,137
Older sister -Older sister

348
00:44:40,138 --> 00:44:42,307
Younger brother -Younger brother

349
00:44:42,308 --> 00:44:43,977
Younger sister -Younger sister

350
00:44:43,979 --> 00:44:46,738
Okay, one more time

351
00:44:48,348 --> 00:44:50,477
Father -Father

352
00:44:50,478 --> 00:44:52,787
Mother -Mother

353
00:44:52,788 --> 00:44:55,047
Older brother -Older brother

354
00:44:55,048 --> 00:44:56,207
Older sister..

355
00:45:05,798 --> 00:45:07,857
Hurry! She's in labor!

356
00:45:09,868 --> 00:45:13,197
Two savages
can never give birth to a Japanese child

357
00:45:17,238 --> 00:45:18,477
Are you alright, Hanako?

358
00:45:18,479 --> 00:45:19,708
This job is for women only. What are you doing?

359
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:22,237
Dakis, get out of here! Get out!

360
00:45:38,858 --> 00:45:41,417
Oh, what an extraordinary sight!

361
00:45:48,109 --> 00:45:49,628
Timber!

362
00:45:58,419 --> 00:46:01,248
(Hark, people)

363
00:46:01,249 --> 00:46:04,148
(Behold, people)

364
00:46:10,498 --> 00:46:15,297
(Oh, our warriors)

365
00:46:15,298 --> 00:46:20,137
(The youngsters
much like the budding pine leaves)

366
00:46:20,138 --> 00:46:24,707
(They show true bravery)

367
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:27,007
(Fought in the falling leaves)

368
00:46:27,008 --> 00:46:29,277
(Fought under the withered pine tree)

369
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:37,557
(Now they're back with heads hunted)

370
00:46:37,558 --> 00:46:42,117
(Our warriors fought with all their might)

371
00:47:02,048 --> 00:47:05,347
(Mahebu Police Station)

372
00:47:41,088 --> 00:47:42,207
Chief!

373
00:47:43,918 --> 00:47:47,887
Pawan, why aren't you in school?

374
00:47:47,888 --> 00:47:49,187
I'm sick

375
00:47:49,188 --> 00:47:52,487
Sick? But you don't look like sick

376
00:47:55,699 --> 00:47:57,428
Did your teacher beat you?

377
00:48:03,138 --> 00:48:06,597
I raced a Japanese kid and I won

378
00:48:07,478 --> 00:48:10,177
And the kid was crying

379
00:48:11,178 --> 00:48:16,547
The teacher blamed me for bullying him,
so he beat me

380
00:48:19,058 --> 00:48:21,217
Can I have another one please?

381
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:28,867
I'll win the race on the sports day

382
00:48:28,868 --> 00:48:34,927
Those Japanese kids can cry their balls out
when they watch me getting awarded

383
00:48:43,848 --> 00:48:46,777
Chief, I hate the Japanese

384
00:49:28,258 --> 00:49:29,757
Chief Mouna?

385
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:34,717
My grandpa said you were a hero
when you were younger

386
00:49:37,598 --> 00:49:40,627
Your grandpa said
I was a hero when I was younger?

387
00:49:41,608 --> 00:49:44,767
I'm still a hero. Does he know that?

388
00:50:08,629 --> 00:50:13,568
Chief Mouna, will you take me along
next time you go hunting?

389
00:50:18,478 --> 00:50:22,607
Pawan, where is your hunting ground?

390
00:50:27,249 --> 00:50:28,338
Chief Mouna!

391
00:50:56,778 --> 00:51:01,007
I'm alright. Just a little bit tipsy, that's all

392
00:51:02,888 --> 00:51:05,117
What the hell?

393
00:51:21,868 --> 00:51:22,767
Hanako!

394
00:51:32,348 --> 00:51:33,747
Look what you have done!

395
00:51:33,749 --> 00:51:38,188
How many times do I have to tell you
that you cannot drag these logs along?

396
00:51:38,919 --> 00:51:43,758
You destroyed the logs
-Only the bark is scratched

397
00:51:43,758 --> 00:51:45,227
The inside is still intact

398
00:51:46,098 --> 00:51:46,727
You savages!

399
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:48,498
How many times do I have to tell you?

400
00:51:53,908 --> 00:51:56,877
What? You wanna fight?

401
00:51:56,878 --> 00:51:58,477
The paths are slippery because of rain

402
00:51:58,478 --> 00:52:04,107
He nearly lost his life slipping down a slope

403
00:52:05,619 --> 00:52:07,848
Where is your log?

404
00:52:09,448 --> 00:52:12,177
Slipped into the ravine -Slipped?

405
00:52:14,958 --> 00:52:18,897
Do you know how expensive it is?

406
00:52:20,528 --> 00:52:21,757
Pihu!

407
00:52:25,638 --> 00:52:26,757
Yoshimura!

408
00:52:31,508 --> 00:52:32,737
Chief Mouna..

409
00:52:38,618 --> 00:52:40,277
Sir Yoshimura?

410
00:52:41,118 --> 00:52:43,317
You're looking at me
at such a disrespectful angle

411
00:52:43,318 --> 00:52:46,307
Aren't you afraid of being stabbed blind?

412
00:52:51,698 --> 00:52:54,257
Who do you think you are?

413
00:52:56,199 --> 00:53:00,658
You're not the boss here in Mehebu

414
00:53:01,938 --> 00:53:03,267
I am!

415
00:53:15,648 --> 00:53:17,277
You will not get paid today

416
00:53:20,658 --> 00:53:24,387
The precious logs are destroyed

417
00:53:26,098 --> 00:53:29,027
Do it again and you'll have to pay for the loss

418
00:53:29,728 --> 00:53:32,037
Keep working! -With what?

419
00:53:32,038 --> 00:53:35,767
We get nothing from working for you

420
00:53:35,769 --> 00:53:38,008
What do you want us to pay with? -Pihu!

421
00:53:38,008 --> 00:53:41,147
Chief Mouna, he... -I saw it

422
00:53:41,149 --> 00:53:42,508
Go home!

423
00:53:43,548 --> 00:53:44,567
Go home!

424
00:53:55,688 --> 00:53:59,497
Yoshimura, stop picking on them

425
00:53:59,498 --> 00:54:01,427
You don't know nothing

426
00:54:03,338 --> 00:54:05,357
I was educating them

427
00:54:29,928 --> 00:54:31,947
These damn savages!

428
00:54:40,938 --> 00:54:42,627
I'll have you pay for this some day

429
00:55:02,588 --> 00:55:03,497
Good morning

430
00:55:03,499 --> 00:55:04,618
Good morning

431
00:55:07,098 --> 00:55:09,327
Good morning

432
00:55:09,328 --> 00:55:11,767
What? Checking out guns?

433
00:55:11,769 --> 00:55:15,298
Watan Robo is getting married
We've got some preparations to do

434
00:55:16,538 --> 00:55:18,377
Tado? Baso?

435
00:55:18,378 --> 00:55:20,777
I heard your father Mouna Rudo

436
00:55:20,778 --> 00:55:24,477
has mobilized lots of men for this hunt?

437
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:30,487
Yeah, but what can we hunt
in those disappearing forests?

438
00:55:30,489 --> 00:55:33,148
You've about hacked down all the trees
on our hunting grounds

439
00:55:33,988 --> 00:55:36,087
If we don't go hunting now

440
00:55:37,498 --> 00:55:40,327
we'll have nothing left
once the trees are all gone

441
00:55:40,328 --> 00:55:41,727
Tado Mouna!

442
00:55:43,299 --> 00:55:44,958
You'd better watch your mouth!

443
00:55:54,608 --> 00:55:56,597
Savages will always be savages

444
00:55:58,818 --> 00:56:00,177
They have no manners at all

445
00:56:15,868 --> 00:56:16,727
Wait!

446
00:56:18,568 --> 00:56:19,367
Pawan?

447
00:56:20,138 --> 00:56:21,537
What is the kid doing there?

448
00:56:28,178 --> 00:56:29,307
Pawan!

449
00:56:57,338 --> 00:57:01,067
Chief Mouna! My hunting ground is right here!

450
00:57:21,468 --> 00:57:22,957
Temu Walis?

451
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,908
You red-foot pheasant!

452
00:57:31,908 --> 00:57:34,437
Don't you know
this is the Mehebu hunting ground?

453
00:57:35,049 --> 00:57:38,718
Mouna! It's just a misunderstanding

454
00:57:38,718 --> 00:57:41,717
This is the first time my eldest son goes hunting

455
00:57:41,718 --> 00:57:44,087
I asked Temu to bring me here

456
00:57:45,258 --> 00:57:48,657
Mouna, I asked Temu to teach him

457
00:57:48,659 --> 00:57:51,418
Even so, you cannot trespass
into our Mehebu hunting ground

458
00:57:52,428 --> 00:57:54,297
This used to be our Toda hunting ground

459
00:57:55,228 --> 00:57:58,627
when my uncle was alive

460
00:57:59,568 --> 00:58:01,107
You Mehebu clansmen robbed it from us

461
00:58:01,108 --> 00:58:04,597
Rob it back if you can -Enough!

462
00:58:13,148 --> 00:58:16,347
Mouna, can you do me this favor?

463
00:58:17,489 --> 00:58:19,148
Favor?

464
00:58:19,718 --> 00:58:20,777
Kojima..

465
00:58:21,828 --> 00:58:25,317
if you lived in Mehebu now, I'd do you this favor

466
00:58:26,328 --> 00:58:28,397
But you live in Tnbarah Clan

467
00:58:28,399 --> 00:58:31,368
Take these red-foot pheasants
and get out of my hunting ground

468
00:58:37,578 --> 00:58:40,247
I don't care if it's your hunting ground or theirs

469
00:58:40,248 --> 00:58:42,937
because everything here
belongs to us Japanese now

470
00:59:16,409 --> 00:59:19,518
Temu, you just wait and see

471
00:59:19,518 --> 00:59:21,417
Some day I'll destroy your Tnbarah Clan

472
00:59:26,418 --> 00:59:29,047
Go on and do it if you dare

473
00:59:30,058 --> 00:59:33,257
Let's see who's killed first

474
00:59:43,408 --> 00:59:46,037
I don't care if you're Mouna Rudo

475
01:00:15,638 --> 01:00:17,407
Wow, well done

476
01:00:17,409 --> 01:00:20,568
Can a girl carry such a heavy load?

477
01:00:21,748 --> 01:00:23,277
Go! Go!

478
01:00:23,278 --> 01:00:25,877
Good girl!

479
01:00:25,878 --> 01:00:29,617
The men in your clan
are all out hunting, aren't they?

480
01:00:29,618 --> 01:00:31,557
Wanna make some extra bucks?

481
01:00:31,558 --> 01:00:33,417
Come with me to my boardinghouse! -No!

482
01:00:33,419 --> 01:00:35,148
I'll give you two dollars -No!

483
01:00:36,528 --> 01:00:38,087
What the hell? Bastard!

484
01:00:42,298 --> 01:00:45,097
Sir Sugiura, how dare you!

485
01:00:45,098 --> 01:00:48,467
Harassing a Mehebu woman?

486
01:00:49,339 --> 01:00:52,378
I was offering her a chance to earn
some extra money in our substation

487
01:00:52,378 --> 01:00:54,107
It's no big deal

488
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:59,517
I know you Japanese policemen too well

489
01:00:59,518 --> 01:01:03,187
Take that blind prey of yours and scram

490
01:01:03,188 --> 01:01:04,987
It's true, and she accepted it too

491
01:01:04,989 --> 01:01:08,528
Another word from you
and I'll have the hounds feast on you

492
01:01:08,528 --> 01:01:10,757
Phooey! Fine, fine

493
01:01:12,028 --> 01:01:14,857
It's hard to reason with you savages

494
01:01:23,038 --> 01:01:27,667
You deserve it! Chicken!

495
01:01:42,589 --> 01:01:44,558
You're back, Sapu

496
01:02:00,038 --> 01:02:02,767
Chief, the matches you wanted

497
01:02:03,449 --> 01:02:05,348
Sapu?

498
01:02:05,351 --> 01:02:09,249
Let the kids eat more meat. They're too skinny
