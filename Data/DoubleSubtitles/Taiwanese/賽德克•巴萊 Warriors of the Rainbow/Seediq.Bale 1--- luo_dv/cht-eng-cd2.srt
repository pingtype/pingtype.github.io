Mouna! Mouna!

Bakan,
why does Mouna need so many matches?

00:00:10,433 --> 00:00:11,491
Who knows?

4
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:15,068
Had any meat, my boy?

Have a drink!

00:00:27,716 --> 00:00:31,854
Father, can we slaughter a cow?

Not enough to eat?
不夠吃嗎？

9
00:00:33,823 --> 00:00:37,384
It's enough, but we haven't had beef
for such a long time
夠！可是大家好久沒吃牛肉了…

10
00:00:40,029 --> 00:00:41,724

Let's slaughter a cow!

of the Japanese Governor-general

-來啦，喝嘛！

27

Your hand is all dirty with blood
小心你手上的血…

28
00:02:05,581 --> 00:02:08,717
I invited you with good will
-You son-of-a-bitch!
-我這麼好意請你…

You've soiled me with blood!

I offered you a drink and you hit me?

-不要打了…

What is it? Let's go look!

Hurry up!

00:02:26,235 --> 00:02:28,703
I know what you said just now
with a boar's head in your hand
你提豬頭喊什麼蕃話我聽不懂嗎？

00:02:30,205 --> 00:02:33,442
Out of my way!
Say it again in Japanese if you dare

00:02:58,367 --> 00:02:59,835
Baso, kill him!
巴索…打死他…

43
00:02:59,835 --> 00:03:02,531
I'm holding down his feet! Beat him up!
我抓住他的腳了，你們用力打！

44
00:03:04,873 --> 00:03:06,773
I'm holding down his feet again!
我又抓住他的腳了…

45
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,301
Stop! All of you!
住手！…通通住手！

46
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,984
What is it? What the hell?
怎麼會這樣？搞什麼東西呀？

47
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:16,975
Let me cut off this pig head of yours!
看我砍下你這顆豬頭…

48
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:42,867
Stop! Stop! Yoshi..
不要打了…不要打了…吉…

49
00:03:43,512 --> 00:03:44,274
Yoshimura
吉村…

50
00:03:51,587 --> 00:03:52,747
Yoshimura
吉村…

51
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:04,756
You're in big trouble
你們完蛋了…

52
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:09,805
You have the nerve to beat me up
-Let's kill him!
竟然敢打我！
殺了他！

53
00:04:09,805 --> 00:04:11,272
Shut your mouth!
你閉嘴！

54
00:04:28,857 --> 00:04:30,586
Excuse us! Let us through!
借過…借過…

55
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:43,265
I'll kill all you Mehebu clansmen
…我一定要殺光你們馬赫坡！

56
00:04:43,972 --> 00:04:47,032
I'll kill you all
…我一定會殺光你們馬赫坡！

57
00:04:48,177 --> 00:04:51,447
Let's do it, Father,
before the Japanese kill us all
父親，先動手吧！
他們不會放過我們的！

58
00:04:51,447 --> 00:04:54,942
Why the hell did you provoke him
when you knew he'd kill us all?
你明知道他們不會放過我們
你還要去惹他？

59
00:04:57,152 --> 00:04:59,154
You're nothing but a bunch of hounds
你們這群只懂追獵…

60
00:04:59,154 --> 00:05:00,951
that can only chase and hunt
and know nothing of self-restraint
不懂控制的獵犬！

61
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,783
How much longer do I have to put up with you?
我要忍耐你們到什麼時侯？

62
00:05:07,863 --> 00:05:10,229
Out of my way!
讓開…讓開…

63
00:05:26,648 --> 00:05:28,616
Now you're here to bribe me with wine?
現在才想到拿酒來求我？

64
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,616
It's too late
來不及了！

65
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:35,389
I've filed the report on the case
of you beating up a police officer
毆打巡查的案子我已經呈報上去了

66
00:05:37,526 --> 00:05:38,959
Tell you something..
告訴你…

67
00:05:40,863 --> 00:05:45,163
This time I'll destroy your clan
我一定要毀了你們整個部落！

68
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:48,763
Yoshimura..
吉村…

69
00:05:49,705 --> 00:05:53,475
I, Mouna Rudo, come here to
apologize to you personally
我莫那魯道親自來跟你道歉

70
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:56,035
Stop being so arrogant
你別太不給臉…

71
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:59,613
Who do you think you are?
莫那魯道又怎樣！

72
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,554
You think you're still a chief?
你還像個頭目嗎？

73
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:13,595
You can't even control your own sons
連自己的兒子都管不好

74
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:16,587
I don't think you're qualified
to be a chief anymore
還有資格當頭目？

75
00:06:23,172 --> 00:06:25,874
Get out!
出去！出去！

76
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:27,743
Who the hell let you in?
誰跟你說可以進來的

77
00:06:27,743 --> 00:06:29,511
Get the hell out!
都給我滾出去！

78
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:31,213
I don't want to see your faces again

79
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:32,407
Go home and rot!
回家等死吧！

80
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,581
Hey! Why did you do that to him?
-Shut up!
喂！你們幹嘛打他呢？
閉嘴！

81
00:06:50,432 --> 00:06:54,303
I couldn't sleep last night because of a mosquito
被一隻蚊子搞到整晚睡不著！

82
00:06:54,303 --> 00:06:56,828
Really? I'll see to it
是喔，那我再去了解一下…

83
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:04,740
Mr. Hanaoka!
花岡先生

84
00:07:08,116 --> 00:07:08,810
Yes?
是！

85
00:07:09,484 --> 00:07:12,419
May I know which clan you grew up in?
請問你是哪一個蕃社長大的？

86
00:07:13,722 --> 00:07:14,882
Gungu Clan
荷戈社！

87
00:07:15,624 --> 00:07:16,613
And your original name?
本名呢？

88
00:07:19,928 --> 00:07:21,597
Dakis Nawi
…達奇斯那威

89
00:07:21,597 --> 00:07:23,462
Dakis Nawi
達奇斯那威…

90
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,238
We have another savage policeman
named Hanoka Ichiro
我們還有個叫花岡一郎的蕃人警察

91
00:07:29,238 --> 00:07:33,436
He is the highest educated policemen here

92
00:07:35,577 --> 00:07:38,239
What are you doing this afternoon?
…你下午有事要忙嗎？

93
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:43,218
I'm going home for some private matter
…我等一下有事情需要回家一趟

94
00:07:43,218 --> 00:07:46,755
I was to ask you
to patrol all the savage clans with us
原本想請你陪我到各蕃社去視察

95
00:07:46,755 --> 00:07:50,953
and tell me the relationships among them all
順便幫我介紹各蕃社的關係…

96
00:07:51,793 --> 00:07:54,193
Come with us! -No, it's alright
-你先陪我們去嘛！
-沒關係…！

97
00:07:55,364 --> 00:07:56,965
It's alright

98
00:07:56,965 --> 00:07:59,627
Do whatever you need to do
你先去辦你的事吧！

99
00:08:02,204 --> 00:08:03,472
It's alright
沒關係！

100
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:05,340
Kabasawa will go with us -Yes
-樺澤會和我們去！
-是的！

101
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,830
He knows the savages well too
他也是個蕃通！

102
00:08:26,128 --> 00:08:28,562
Yoshimura has reported
Tado's case to the substation
吉村已經把達多的案子…

103
00:08:29,698 --> 00:08:31,791
上報到分室來了！

104
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,166
I can't believe this Yoshimura
這個吉村也真是的…

105
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,902
Chief Mouna apologized to him personally
莫那頭目都親自去道歉了

106
00:09:06,902 --> 00:09:09,427
Why did he insist on filing the case?
怎麼還硬要把案子往上送！

107
00:09:10,906 --> 00:09:15,010
Yoshimura and Sugiura are not the same
as Kojima after all
吉村和衫浦，畢竟不是小島

108
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,913
They will never try to understand our people
是不會花心思去了解族人

109
00:09:17,913 --> 00:09:23,412
If Kojima were living in Mehebu
there wouldn't be so much trouble
如果小島在馬赫坡的話…
這事就算發生，也不會這麼嚴重

110
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:28,556
Since I was very little
從小到大…

111
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:32,585
I've always been scared of Chief Mouna
我一看到莫那頭目都會害怕

112
00:09:35,597 --> 00:09:40,435
It looks as if underneath his mantle
he's always gripping his machete
總覺得他藏在披風裡的手

113
00:09:40,435 --> 00:09:43,734
ready to draw it to kill anytime
是隨時握著刀準備獵殺的！

114
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,709
He's no ordinary man
不能小看他…

115
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:50,644
He's impossible to be tamed
他是不可能被馴服的！

116
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:56,651
It must be difficult for him to torn between
the expectations of his fellow tribesmen
夾在族人期望和日本人威脅之間

117
00:09:56,651 --> 00:09:59,921
and the intimidation of the Japanese
生活是很痛苦的！

118
00:09:59,921 --> 00:10:02,549
Aren't we living like that as well?
我們兩個不也是這樣子嗎？

119
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:06,895
We don't want to be savages
…不想當野蠻人

120
00:10:06,895 --> 00:10:09,659
but however hard
we try to dress up like the Japanese
但不管怎麼努力裝扮

121
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:14,535
we'll always be seen as uncivilized people
也改變不了這張不被文明認同的臉

122
00:10:16,772 --> 00:10:19,908
We've lived like this for 20 years
已經忍了二十年了

123
00:10:19,908 --> 00:10:22,638
Another 20 years won't be impossible
就再忍個二十年吧！

124
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,915
By the time our children grow up
等我們的孩子長大…

125
00:10:26,915 --> 00:10:30,407
maybe we will have changed forever
the savage image of ours
或許就能徹底改變我們的野蠻形象

126
00:10:32,387 --> 00:10:34,321
Do we still have the chance?
忍得了嗎？

127
00:10:35,223 --> 00:10:39,057
Mehebu Clan may be wiped out soon
馬赫坡就要被趕盡殺絕了…

128
00:11:06,154 --> 00:11:08,486
Father, let's fight the Japanese
父親…和日本人拚了吧！

129
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,656
Ouch! It hurts! -You dumb ass!
-燙…好燙啊…
-混帳東西！

130
00:11:17,566 --> 00:11:19,363
Father, don't be mad!
父親…不要生氣…

131
00:11:19,668 --> 00:11:23,038
Father! -You never learn!
-父親…父親…
-講不聽！

132
00:11:23,038 --> 00:11:27,998
Enough! -You moron!
-好了…夠了啦…
-混帳東西！

133
00:11:58,406 --> 00:12:00,340
Oh no! How come..
糟糕…怎麼…

134
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:03,979
It's the temporary bamboo bridge
that the savages used in the past
那是蕃人以前使用的竹便橋

135
00:12:03,979 --> 00:12:06,114
It's ugly and insecure,
又醜又不堅固

136
00:12:06,114 --> 00:12:08,783
but they keep walking over it
可是他們還老是要走那邊…

137
00:12:08,783 --> 00:12:11,219
I'll tear it down sooner or later
哪天我直接把它給拆了！

138
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:14,756
But it saves them lots of time
if they walk over it to fetch water or to the field
其實他們提水或是到田裡…
都還是走那邊比較方便呀！

139
00:12:14,756 --> 00:12:18,590
Look! This wire bridge is strong and firm
你看這鐵線橋做得這麼堅固！

140
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:23,891
Tado?
達多…

141
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,834
Tado?
達多…

142
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:39,581
This young man is Tado Mouna
這個年輕人叫達多莫那

143
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:41,742
the eldest son of the Mehebu chief Mouna Rudo
是馬赫坡社頭目莫那魯道的長子

144
00:12:43,652 --> 00:12:48,523
But he saw us without saying anything
Is there anything wrong with him?
他見到我們怎麼沒有任何表示？
是不是有什麼問題？

145
00:12:48,523 --> 00:12:53,321
No, it's a habit of the savages
-It's not a very good habit
沒事！這是蕃人的習慣！
這不是很好的習慣！

146
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:56,765
Oh well, they're savages after all
…因為他們是生蕃嘛！

147
00:12:56,765 --> 00:12:59,000
Can you stop talking about them like that?
你可以不要一直用這種口氣嗎？

148
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,305
Sugiura! -Welcome, sirs
-衫浦…
-主任、課長，歡迎！

149
00:13:03,305 --> 00:13:05,140
This is Officer Sugiura
這位是衫浦巡查…

150
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,975
This way please
請往這邊走！

151
00:13:06,975 --> 00:13:09,244
You should've informed me
before you came here, sir
課長要來怎麼不先通知呢？

152
00:13:09,244 --> 00:13:13,815
I could've asked those savages
to welcome you with dances
我可以叫這些蕃人來跳舞歡迎啊！

153
00:13:13,815 --> 00:13:15,383
No need for that
不用麻煩了…

154
00:13:15,383 --> 00:13:18,318
We're only showing our hospitality
哎呀！課長怎麼這樣客氣呀！

155
00:13:24,192 --> 00:13:25,489
Chief Mouna!
莫那頭目…

156
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,293
Chief Mouna!
莫那頭目…

157
00:13:35,837 --> 00:13:36,963
What?
幹嘛？

158
00:13:43,311 --> 00:13:44,980
Chief Mouna,
莫那頭目…

159
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,682
can you tell me something about Japan?
跟我說說日本內地的事吧！

160
00:13:47,682 --> 00:13:49,775
I know you've been there before
我知道你去過日本！

161
00:13:55,957 --> 00:13:59,661
They have armies, cannons, machineguns
…日本有軍隊、大砲和機關槍…

162
00:13:59,661 --> 00:14:01,896
airplanes and large steamers in Japan
飛機和大輪船…

163
00:14:01,896 --> 00:14:05,700
There are more Japanese people
than the tree leaves in the forest
日本人比森林的樹葉還要繁密

164
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,168
than the pebbles in Jhuoshuei River
比濁水溪的石頭還多！

165
00:14:09,537 --> 00:14:11,473
I know why you're asking me this
我也知道你問這些…

166
00:14:11,473 --> 00:14:13,608
You don't really want to know Japan
並不是真的想知道那裡的事

167
00:14:13,608 --> 00:14:16,543
All you want is to remind me
how powerful the Japanese are
你只是要提醒我日本有多厲害而已

168
00:14:19,848 --> 00:14:23,113
Don't worry. I'll never forget
你放心吧！我不會忘記的！

169
00:14:26,354 --> 00:14:31,393
Humph! You Japanese policemen
took us on the ship for days to Japan
哼！你們這些日本警察…
帶我們坐好幾天的船去日本

170
00:14:31,393 --> 00:14:35,697
but all they showed us
were airplanes and cannons
卻只讓我們看飛機、大砲…

171
00:14:35,697 --> 00:14:37,098
However, the policemen in Japan
不過…

172
00:14:37,098 --> 00:14:39,801
were much nicer and kinder
than those of you here
那邊的警察比你們山地警察好多了

173
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:43,038
They feared we'd revolt against them
so they tried their best to befriend us
他們擔心反抗，想盡辦法對我們好

174
00:14:43,038 --> 00:14:45,940
But those of you here in the mountains
但是你們這些山地日本警察

175
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,171
always provoke us so much
that I want to hunt your heads
卻總是壞得讓我想出草！

176
00:14:52,213 --> 00:14:55,917
Chief Mouna, I'm still a Seediq
莫那頭目，我還是一個賽德克啊！

177
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:58,486
Although I'm now a Japanese policeman
雖然我是日本警察

178
00:14:58,486 --> 00:15:00,750
I never forget
that the same blood runs in our veins
但我沒忘記我和你們流著一樣的血…

179
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:09,631
Dakis, when you die
are you entering a Japanese shrine?
達奇斯…
你將來要進日本人的神社？

180
00:15:09,631 --> 00:15:11,963
Or the heavenly home of our ancestors?
還是我們祖靈的家？

181
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:23,378
I heard that..
…我聽說了

182
00:15:23,378 --> 00:15:28,380
in the school for savage children
you beat up our kids like the Japanese do
你在蕃童教育所裡…
像日本人一樣地打著我們的孩子！

183
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:41,029
I beat them up because I don't want
the Japanese to look down on them
我打他們是希望…
…希望他們不要被日本人瞧不起！

184
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:43,231
You graduated from Normal School
你師範學校畢業

185
00:15:43,231 --> 00:15:48,269
You're more highly-educated
than any other Japanese policemen
學歷比其他的日本警察還高

186
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:51,261
But how come you get the lowest salary?
為什麼你領的薪水是最低的？

187
00:15:52,674 --> 00:15:55,310
Don't the Japanese look down on you already?
日本人瞧得起你嗎？

188
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,835
Beating up your own people makes them
look down on you even more
…自己打自己才會讓人瞧不起！

189
00:16:05,787 --> 00:16:09,424
During our stay in Japan
以前去日本觀光的時侯

190
00:16:09,424 --> 00:16:13,695
the Japanese knew all of us chiefs
from different clans hated one another
日本人明知道我們族群間有仇恨…

191
00:16:13,695 --> 00:16:17,132
but they made us sit together
at the dining table deliberately
還故意安排我們坐在一起吃飯

192
00:16:17,132 --> 00:16:20,869
We were glaring at one another
all the time while we were eating
讓我們每個人邊吃飯邊瞪著對方

193
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:23,770
intending to draw our machetes and kill
恨不得馬上拔刀殺了對方！

194
00:16:26,608 --> 00:16:29,736
Humph! The Japanese are good at these things
哼，這些日本人就是懂這個…

195
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:36,109
Chief, is it so bad to be ruled by the Japanese?
頭目，被日本統治不好嗎？

196
00:16:38,186 --> 00:16:40,455
At least we're leading a civilized life
我們現在文明的過生活

197
00:16:40,455 --> 00:16:43,792
We have schools and post offices
有教育所，有郵局

198
00:16:43,792 --> 00:16:48,828
and we don't have to survive
by hunting savagely anymore
不必再像從前一樣…
得靠野蠻的獵殺才能生存

199
00:16:50,165 --> 00:16:52,200
Is it so bad to be ruled by the Japanese?
…被日本人統治不好嗎？

200
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,327
Is it so good to be ruled by them?
被日本人統治好嗎？

201
00:16:55,703 --> 00:16:58,640
Our men are forced to bend over
to carry logs on our backs
男人被迫彎腰搬木頭

202
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,701
and our women have to kneel down
to serve and pour wine
女人被迫跪著幫傭陪酒

203
00:17:03,011 --> 00:17:06,981
And all the money ends up
in the pockets of the Japanese policemen
該領的錢全進了日本警察的口袋

204
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:09,484
I'm a chief
我這個當頭目的…

205
00:17:09,484 --> 00:17:12,053
but all I can do is get drunk
and pretend I see nothing and hear nothing
除了每天醉酒假裝看不見、聽不見

206
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:14,088
What else can I do?
還能怎麼樣？

207
00:17:14,088 --> 00:17:17,959
Post offices? Stores? Schools?
郵局？商店？學校？

208
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,463
Do any of those things
make our lives easier and better?
什麼時侯讓族人的生活過得更好？

209
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:26,264
Instead,
we're made to see how impoverished we are
反倒讓他們看見自己有多貧窮了！

210
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:39,080
Chief, can't we bear it for another 20 years?
頭目…
我們再忍個二十年好嗎？

211
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,718
In 20 years, there will be no Seediq
and there will be no hunting ground
再二十年就不是賽德克！
就沒有獵場！

212
00:17:43,718 --> 00:17:45,515
All our children will have turned Japanese
孩子全都是日本人了！

213
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,710
Chief Mouna,
…莫那頭目…

214
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,610
have you made up your mind to do it?
你真的要幹了嗎？

215
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:18,143
Chief Mouna?
莫那頭目…

216
00:18:19,354 --> 00:18:22,448
About Yoshimura... -I'm old
-毆打吉村的事…
-我已經老了…

217
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,626
Don't worry
放心吧！

218
00:18:24,626 --> 00:18:27,795
The Japanese are far too powerful
日本人這麼厲害

219
00:18:27,795 --> 00:18:29,922
I won't go against them
我不敢怎樣的…

220
00:18:31,466 --> 00:18:34,168
Go home
你回去吧！

Get lost
你走開！

223
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:44,240
Chief... -Get lost!

Dakis, have a drink

Go home and get yourself dead-drunk

We can't drink anymore

227
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,838
We already... -Drink!

228
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:12,806

229
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:17,412
can set our people free

cry and laugh freely

233
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,017
Mouna!
莫那…

234
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,458
Father?

235
00:20:49,937 --> 00:20:55,043
Mouna, the tattoos on your face
are still so dark and clear
莫那！
你臉上的刺紋還是這麼的深黑…

You're a true hero

Mouna? Look at the lines on that rock

It split into half
when struck by the lightening, didn't it?
你看那巨石的線條…
是被雷光削開的吧！

the lightening splits a rock into half

Tado Mouna became a hero before I did

Are you kidding me?

my question from last time
達奇斯…

你忍心看著他們死去的靈魂

可是這麼濃的霧…
