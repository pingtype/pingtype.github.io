Captain
大尉，他只敢帶你們到人止關

in Meisi
然後她在她的眉溪老家過夜

Those savages in the mountains

It was so dark last night
昨晚夜黑…

145

their eyes blank

Ubus..

any of our hunting grounds in the past
我們祖先再怎樣也沒失去過獵場…

278
00:39:56,358 --> 00:40:00,987

all the Wushe savages

It's not an easy task
真是不容易啊！

284

Hard to imagine that this was once
the most uncivilized heartland here
很難想像這裡曾經是…
這島上最黑暗的心臟地帶呀！

285
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,690
Carrying logs..
他們扛著木頭

takes them a whole day, doesn't it?
從山上的製材場走到這裡…

287

Don't worry. These savages are strong
不就已經一整天嗎？

288
00:40:34,628 --> 00:40:44,465
And they're more than happy
to earn some money for millet wine
沒關係…這些生蕃身強體壯
給他們幾個錢買酒就很高興了

Come on. This way please
來，請往這邊走…

290

So you know this region very well?

Of course. My wife is a savage woman
當然…連我妻子都是蕃人了

295

I know this region like the back of my hand
-It's this bone right here
-我能不瞭解嗎？

296
00:41:06,827 --> 00:41:08,762
It hurts so much when you press it
這樣壓就好痛…

297
00:41:08,762 --> 00:41:10,097
Right here?

298
00:41:10,097 --> 00:41:11,798
Ah! Easy!
啊…你小力一點…

Here! Have a drink!
來！來…喝酒！喝酒！

老闆，別再拿酒了

This one's on me

You're indeed a beautiful serpent
老闆呀，你真是一隻美麗的蛇唷！

304
00:41:32,652 --> 00:41:35,255
Every day I carry those damn logs
without getting paid properly
每天扛這種領不到錢的木頭

305
00:41:35,255 --> 00:41:37,587
Now I'm so broke that even my hounds
look down on me
窮到連我的獵犬都瞧不起我了…

306
00:41:38,859 --> 00:41:41,061
We're losing our hunting grounds
獵場都快沒了

307
00:41:41,061 --> 00:41:44,398
and you still keep the hounds
to look down on you?
還留著獵犬來瞧不起人？

308
00:41:44,398 --> 00:41:47,534
Those are the trees
that used to watch over our ancestors
Look!
你看！
那些看過我們祖先的樹…

309
00:41:47,534 --> 00:41:49,502
This is how they end up
都變成這樣的木頭了…

310
00:41:50,871 --> 00:41:54,975
Strange thing is, why so many constructions?
奇怪…怎麼有那麼多的工程啊？

311
00:41:54,975 --> 00:42:00,375
What? Not only do you befriend us with wine
but you speak our language fluently
咦！你這個酒料蕃通

Hey! It's going to rain

-Good morning, sir!
-不回去還在這喝酒！

Good morning, Mr. Policeman

for such a mean wage
辛辛苦苦扛了一天的木頭

316
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,864
and you waste it on wine?

What else can we do with so little money?
這些錢除了買酒還能做什麼？

318
00:42:21,635 --> 00:42:24,704
Yeah, right! We're savages, aren't we?
對啦！我們是蕃人

319
00:42:24,704 --> 00:42:27,641
We aren't supposed to know
anything about saving money
怎麼會懂得存錢呢？

對啦！警察大人

Run, sir!

什麼事該先做也不知道…真難教…

Slipped into the ravine -Slipped?

Do you know how expensive it is?

404

405
00:52:25,638 --> 00:52:26,764

Sir Yoshimura?

at such a disrespectful angle

You will not get paid today

The precious logs are destroyed

We get nothing from working for you

What? Checking out guns?

對啊！只是消失的森林哪來的獵物？

on our hunting grounds

into our Mehebu hunting ground
那也不應該跑進我馬赫坡的獵場！

when my uncle was alive

You Mehebu clansmen robbed it from us

Take these red-foot pheasants

就給我帶著這群紅腳鳩…
滾離我的獵場！

Go on and do it if you dare

I'll give you two dollars -No!

Get out of my way! -I dare you!
-讓開…
-你敢不敢講啊？

39
00:02:43,185 --> 00:02:44,453
Come on, guys!
大家過去！

40
00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:45,750
Faster!
跑快一點！

41
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,084
Tado!
達多…

42
00:02:58,367 --> 00:02:59,835
Baso, kill him!
巴索…打死他…

43
00:02:59,835 --> 00:03:02,531
I'm holding down his feet! Beat him up!
我抓住他的腳了，你們用力打！

44
00:03:04,873 --> 00:03:06,773
I'm holding down his feet again!
我又抓住他的腳了…

45
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,301
Stop! All of you!
住手！…通通住手！

46
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,984
What is it? What the hell?
怎麼會這樣？搞什麼東西呀？

47
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:16,975
Let me cut off this pig head of yours!
看我砍下你這顆豬頭…

48
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:42,867
Stop! Stop! Yoshi..
不要打了…不要打了…吉…

49
00:03:43,512 --> 00:03:44,274
Yoshimura
吉村…

50
00:03:51,587 --> 00:03:52,747
Yoshimura
吉村…

51
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:04,756
You're in big trouble
你們完蛋了…

52
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:09,805
You have the nerve to beat me up
-Let's kill him!
竟然敢打我！
殺了他！

53
00:04:09,805 --> 00:04:11,272
Shut your mouth!
你閉嘴！

54
00:04:28,857 --> 00:04:30,586
Excuse us! Let us through!
借過…借過…

55
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:43,265
I'll kill all you Mehebu clansmen
…我一定要殺光你們馬赫坡！

56
00:04:43,972 --> 00:04:47,032
I'll kill you all
…我一定會殺光你們馬赫坡！

57
00:04:48,177 --> 00:04:51,447
Let's do it, Father,
before the Japanese kill us all
父親，先動手吧！
他們不會放過我們的！

58
00:04:51,447 --> 00:04:54,942
Why the hell did you provoke him
when you knew he'd kill us all?
你明知道他們不會放過我們
你還要去惹他？

59
00:04:57,152 --> 00:04:59,154
You're nothing but a bunch of hounds
你們這群只懂追獵…

60
00:04:59,154 --> 00:05:00,951
that can only chase and hunt
and know nothing of self-restraint
不懂控制的獵犬！

61
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,783
How much longer do I have to put up with you?
我要忍耐你們到什麼時侯？

62
00:05:07,863 --> 00:05:10,229
Out of my way!
讓開…讓開…

63
00:05:26,648 --> 00:05:28,616
Now you're here to bribe me with wine?
現在才想到拿酒來求我？

64
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,616
It's too late
來不及了！

65
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:35,389
I've filed the report on the case
of you beating up a police officer
毆打巡查的案子我已經呈報上去了

66
00:05:37,526 --> 00:05:38,959
Tell you something..
告訴你…

67
00:05:40,863 --> 00:05:45,163
This time I'll destroy your clan
我一定要毀了你們整個部落！

68
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:48,763
Yoshimura..
吉村…

69
00:05:49,705 --> 00:05:53,475
I, Mouna Rudo, come here to
apologize to you personally
我莫那魯道親自來跟你道歉

70
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:56,035
Stop being so arrogant
你別太不給臉…

71
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:59,613
Who do you think you are?
莫那魯道又怎樣！

72
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,554
You think you're still a chief?
你還像個頭目嗎？

73
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:13,595
You can't even control your own sons
連自己的兒子都管不好

74
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:16,587
I don't think you're qualified
to be a chief anymore
還有資格當頭目？

75
00:06:23,172 --> 00:06:25,874
Get out!
出去！出去！

76
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:27,743
Who the hell let you in?
誰跟你說可以進來的

77
00:06:27,743 --> 00:06:29,511
Get the hell out!
都給我滾出去！

78
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:31,213
I don't want to see your faces again
我不要再看到你們…

79
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:32,407
Go home and rot!
回家等死吧！

80
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,581
Hey! Why did you do that to him?
-Shut up!
喂！你們幹嘛打他呢？
閉嘴！

81
00:06:50,432 --> 00:06:54,303
I couldn't sleep last night because of a mosquito
被一隻蚊子搞到整晚睡不著！

82
00:06:54,303 --> 00:06:56,828
Really? I'll see to it
是喔，那我再去了解一下…

83
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:04,740
Mr. Hanaoka!
花岡先生

84
00:07:08,116 --> 00:07:08,810
Yes?
是！

85
00:07:09,484 --> 00:07:12,419
May I know which clan you grew up in?
請問你是哪一個蕃社長大的？

86
00:07:13,722 --> 00:07:14,882
Gungu Clan
荷戈社！

87
00:07:15,624 --> 00:07:16,613
And your original name?
本名呢？

88
00:07:19,928 --> 00:07:21,597
Dakis Nawi
…達奇斯那威

89
00:07:21,597 --> 00:07:23,462
Dakis Nawi
達奇斯那威…

90
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,238
We have another savage policeman
named Hanoka Ichiro
我們還有個叫花岡一郎的蕃人警察

91
00:07:29,238 --> 00:07:33,436
He is the highest educated policemen here

92
00:07:35,577 --> 00:07:38,239
What are you doing this afternoon?
…你下午有事要忙嗎？

93
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:43,218
I'm going home for some private matter
…我等一下有事情需要回家一趟

94
00:07:43,218 --> 00:07:46,755
I was to ask you
to patrol all the savage clans with us
原本想請你陪我到各蕃社去視察

95
00:07:46,755 --> 00:07:50,953
and tell me the relationships among them all
順便幫我介紹各蕃社的關係…

96
00:07:51,793 --> 00:07:54,193
Come with us! -No, it's alright
-你先陪我們去嘛！
-沒關係…！

97
00:07:55,364 --> 00:07:56,965
It's alright
沒關係的！

98
00:07:56,965 --> 00:07:59,627
Do whatever you need to do
你先去辦你的事吧！

99
00:08:02,204 --> 00:08:03,472
It's alright
沒關係！

100
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:05,340
Kabasawa will go with us -Yes
-樺澤會和我們去！
-是的！

101
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,830
He knows the savages well too
他也是個蕃通！

102
00:08:26,128 --> 00:08:28,562
Yoshimura has reported
Tado's case to the substation
吉村已經把達多的案子…

103
00:08:29,698 --> 00:08:31,791
上報到分室來了！

104
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,166
I can't believe this Yoshimura
這個吉村也真是的…

105
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,902
Chief Mouna apologized to him personally
莫那頭目都親自去道歉了

106
00:09:06,902 --> 00:09:09,427
Why did he insist on filing the case?
怎麼還硬要把案子往上送！

107
00:09:10,906 --> 00:09:15,010
Yoshimura and Sugiura are not the same
as Kojima after all
吉村和衫浦，畢竟不是小島

108
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,913
They will never try to understand our people
是不會花心思去了解族人

109
00:09:17,913 --> 00:09:23,412
If Kojima were living in Mehebu
there wouldn't be so much trouble
如果小島在馬赫坡的話…
這事就算發生，也不會這麼嚴重

110
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:28,556
Since I was very little
從小到大…

111
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:32,585
I've always been scared of Chief Mouna
我一看到莫那頭目都會害怕

112
00:09:35,597 --> 00:09:40,435
It looks as if underneath his mantle
he's always gripping his machete
總覺得他藏在披風裡的手

113
00:09:40,435 --> 00:09:43,734
ready to draw it to kill anytime
是隨時握著刀準備獵殺的！

114
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,709
He's no ordinary man
不能小看他…

115
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:50,644
He's impossible to be tamed
他是不可能被馴服的！

116
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:56,651
It must be difficult for him to torn between
the expectations of his fellow tribesmen
夾在族人期望和日本人威脅之間

117
00:09:56,651 --> 00:09:59,921
and the intimidation of the Japanese
生活是很痛苦的！

118
00:09:59,921 --> 00:10:02,549
Aren't we living like that as well?
我們兩個不也是這樣子嗎？

119
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:06,895
We don't want to be savages
…不想當野蠻人

120
00:10:06,895 --> 00:10:09,659
but however hard
we try to dress up like the Japanese
但不管怎麼努力裝扮

121
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:14,535
we'll always be seen as uncivilized people
也改變不了這張不被文明認同的臉

122
00:10:16,772 --> 00:10:19,908
We've lived like this for 20 years
已經忍了二十年了

123
00:10:19,908 --> 00:10:22,638
Another 20 years won't be impossible
就再忍個二十年吧！

124
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,915
By the time our children grow up
等我們的孩子長大…

125
00:10:26,915 --> 00:10:30,407
maybe we will have changed forever
the savage image of ours
或許就能徹底改變我們的野蠻形象

126
00:10:32,387 --> 00:10:34,321
Do we still have the chance?
忍得了嗎？

127
00:10:35,223 --> 00:10:39,057
Mehebu Clan may be wiped out soon
馬赫坡就要被趕盡殺絕了…

128
00:11:06,154 --> 00:11:08,486
Father, let's fight the Japanese
父親…和日本人拚了吧！

129
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,656
Ouch! It hurts! -You dumb ass!
-燙…好燙啊…
-混帳東西！

130
00:11:17,566 --> 00:11:19,363
Father, don't be mad!
父親…不要生氣…

131
00:11:19,668 --> 00:11:23,038
Father! -You never learn!
-父親…父親…
-講不聽！

132
00:11:23,038 --> 00:11:27,998
Enough! -You moron!
-好了…夠了啦…
-混帳東西！

133
00:11:58,406 --> 00:12:00,340
Oh no! How come..
糟糕…怎麼…

134
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:03,979
It's the temporary bamboo bridge
that the savages used in the past
那是蕃人以前使用的竹便橋

135
00:12:03,979 --> 00:12:06,114
It's ugly and insecure,
又醜又不堅固

136
00:12:06,114 --> 00:12:08,783
but they keep walking over it
可是他們還老是要走那邊…

137
00:12:08,783 --> 00:12:11,219
I'll tear it down sooner or later
哪天我直接把它給拆了！

138
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:14,756
But it saves them lots of time
if they walk over it to fetch water or to the field
其實他們提水或是到田裡…
都還是走那邊比較方便呀！

139
00:12:14,756 --> 00:12:18,590
Look! This wire bridge is strong and firm
你看這鐵線橋做得這麼堅固！

140
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:23,891
Tado?
達多…

141
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,834
Tado?
達多…

142
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:39,581
This young man is Tado Mouna
這個年輕人叫達多莫那

143
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:41,742
the eldest son of the Mehebu chief Mouna Rudo
是馬赫坡社頭目莫那魯道的長子

144
00:12:43,652 --> 00:12:48,523
But he saw us without saying anything
Is there anything wrong with him?
他見到我們怎麼沒有任何表示？
是不是有什麼問題？

145
00:12:48,523 --> 00:12:53,321
No, it's a habit of the savages
-It's not a very good habit
沒事！這是蕃人的習慣！
這不是很好的習慣！

146
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:56,765
Oh well, they're savages after all
…因為他們是生蕃嘛！

147
00:12:56,765 --> 00:12:59,000
Can you stop talking about them like that?
你可以不要一直用這種口氣嗎？

148
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,305
Sugiura! -Welcome, sirs
-衫浦…
-主任、課長，歡迎！

149
00:13:03,305 --> 00:13:05,140
This is Officer Sugiura
這位是衫浦巡查…

150
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,975
This way please
請往這邊走！

151
00:13:06,975 --> 00:13:09,244
You should've informed me
before you came here, sir
課長要來怎麼不先通知呢？

152
00:13:09,244 --> 00:13:13,815
I could've asked those savages
to welcome you with dances
我可以叫這些蕃人來跳舞歡迎啊！

153
00:13:13,815 --> 00:13:15,383
No need for that
不用麻煩了…

154
00:13:15,383 --> 00:13:18,318
We're only showing our hospitality
哎呀！課長怎麼這樣客氣呀！

155
00:13:24,192 --> 00:13:25,489
Chief Mouna!
莫那頭目…

156
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,293
Chief Mouna!
莫那頭目…

157
00:13:35,837 --> 00:13:36,963
What?
幹嘛？

158
00:13:43,311 --> 00:13:44,980
Chief Mouna,
莫那頭目…

159
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,682
can you tell me something about Japan?
跟我說說日本內地的事吧！

160
00:13:47,682 --> 00:13:49,775
I know you've been there before
我知道你去過日本！

161
00:13:55,957 --> 00:13:59,661
They have armies, cannons, machineguns
…日本有軍隊、大砲和機關槍…

162
00:13:59,661 --> 00:14:01,896
airplanes and large steamers in Japan
飛機和大輪船…

163
00:14:01,896 --> 00:14:05,700
There are more Japanese people
than the tree leaves in the forest
日本人比森林的樹葉還要繁密

164
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,168
than the pebbles in Jhuoshuei River
比濁水溪的石頭還多！

165
00:14:09,537 --> 00:14:11,473
I know why you're asking me this
我也知道你問這些…

166
00:14:11,473 --> 00:14:13,608
You don't really want to know Japan
並不是真的想知道那裡的事

167
00:14:13,608 --> 00:14:16,543
All you want is to remind me
how powerful the Japanese are
你只是要提醒我日本有多厲害而已

168
00:14:19,848 --> 00:14:23,113
Don't worry. I'll never forget
你放心吧！我不會忘記的！

169
00:14:26,354 --> 00:14:31,393
Humph! You Japanese policemen
took us on the ship for days to Japan
哼！你們這些日本警察…
帶我們坐好幾天的船去日本

170
00:14:31,393 --> 00:14:35,697
but all they showed us
were airplanes and cannons
卻只讓我們看飛機、大砲…

171
00:14:35,697 --> 00:14:37,098
However, the policemen in Japan
不過…

172
00:14:37,098 --> 00:14:39,801
were much nicer and kinder
than those of you here
那邊的警察比你們山地警察好多了

173
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:43,038
They feared we'd revolt against them
so they tried their best to befriend us
他們擔心反抗，想盡辦法對我們好

174
00:14:43,038 --> 00:14:45,940
But those of you here in the mountains
但是你們這些山地日本警察

175
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,171
always provoke us so much
that I want to hunt your heads
卻總是壞得讓我想出草！

176
00:14:52,213 --> 00:14:55,917
Chief Mouna, I'm still a Seediq
莫那頭目，我還是一個賽德克啊！

177
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:58,486
Although I'm now a Japanese policeman
雖然我是日本警察

178
00:14:58,486 --> 00:15:00,750
I never forget
that the same blood runs in our veins
但我沒忘記我和你們流著一樣的血…

179
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:09,631
Dakis, when you die
are you entering a Japanese shrine?
達奇斯…
你將來要進日本人的神社？

180
00:15:09,631 --> 00:15:11,963
Or the heavenly home of our ancestors?
還是我們祖靈的家？

181
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:23,378
I heard that..
…我聽說了

182
00:15:23,378 --> 00:15:28,380
in the school for savage children
you beat up our kids like the Japanese do
你在蕃童教育所裡…
像日本人一樣地打著我們的孩子！

183
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:41,029
I beat them up because I don't want
the Japanese to look down on them
我打他們是希望…
…希望他們不要被日本人瞧不起！

184
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:43,231
You graduated from Normal School
你師範學校畢業

185
00:15:43,231 --> 00:15:48,269
You're more highly-educated
than any other Japanese policemen
學歷比其他的日本警察還高

186
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:51,261
But how come you get the lowest salary?
為什麼你領的薪水是最低的？

187
00:15:52,674 --> 00:15:55,310
Don't the Japanese look down on you already?
日本人瞧得起你嗎？

188
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,835
Beating up your own people makes them
look down on you even more
…自己打自己才會讓人瞧不起！

189
00:16:05,787 --> 00:16:09,424
During our stay in Japan
以前去日本觀光的時侯

190
00:16:09,424 --> 00:16:13,695
the Japanese knew all of us chiefs
from different clans hated one another
日本人明知道我們族群間有仇恨…

191
00:16:13,695 --> 00:16:17,132
but they made us sit together
at the dining table deliberately
還故意安排我們坐在一起吃飯

192
00:16:17,132 --> 00:16:20,869
We were glaring at one another
all the time while we were eating
讓我們每個人邊吃飯邊瞪著對方

193
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:23,770
intending to draw our machetes and kill
恨不得馬上拔刀殺了對方！

194
00:16:26,608 --> 00:16:29,736
Humph! The Japanese are good at these things
哼，這些日本人就是懂這個…

195
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:36,109
Chief, is it so bad to be ruled by the Japanese?
頭目，被日本統治不好嗎？

196
00:16:38,186 --> 00:16:40,455
At least we're leading a civilized life
我們現在文明的過生活

197
00:16:40,455 --> 00:16:43,792
We have schools and post offices
有教育所，有郵局

198
00:16:43,792 --> 00:16:48,828
and we don't have to survive
by hunting savagely anymore
不必再像從前一樣…
得靠野蠻的獵殺才能生存

199
00:16:50,165 --> 00:16:52,200
Is it so bad to be ruled by the Japanese?
…被日本人統治不好嗎？

200
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,327
Is it so good to be ruled by them?
被日本人統治好嗎？

201
00:16:55,703 --> 00:16:58,640
Our men are forced to bend over
to carry logs on our backs
男人被迫彎腰搬木頭

202
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,701
and our women have to kneel down
to serve and pour wine
女人被迫跪著幫傭陪酒

203
00:17:03,011 --> 00:17:06,981
And all the money ends up
in the pockets of the Japanese policemen
該領的錢全進了日本警察的口袋

204
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:09,484
I'm a chief
我這個當頭目的…

205
00:17:09,484 --> 00:17:12,053
but all I can do is get drunk
and pretend I see nothing and hear nothing
除了每天醉酒假裝看不見、聽不見

206
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:14,088
What else can I do?
還能怎麼樣？

207
00:17:14,088 --> 00:17:17,959
Post offices? Stores? Schools?
郵局？商店？學校？

208
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,463
Do any of those things
make our lives easier and better?
什麼時侯讓族人的生活過得更好？

209
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:26,264
Instead,
we're made to see how impoverished we are
反倒讓他們看見自己有多貧窮了！

210
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:39,080
Chief, can't we bear it for another 20 years?
頭目…
我們再忍個二十年好嗎？

211
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,718
In 20 years, there will be no Seediq
and there will be no hunting ground
再二十年就不是賽德克！
就沒有獵場！

212
00:17:43,718 --> 00:17:45,515
All our children will have turned Japanese
孩子全都是日本人了！

213
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,710
Chief Mouna,
…莫那頭目…

214
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,610
have you made up your mind to do it?
你真的要幹了嗎？

215
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:18,143
Chief Mouna?
莫那頭目…

216
00:18:19,354 --> 00:18:22,448
About Yoshimura... -I'm old
-毆打吉村的事…
-我已經老了…

217
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,626
Don't worry
放心吧！

218
00:18:24,626 --> 00:18:27,795
The Japanese are far too powerful
日本人這麼厲害

219
00:18:27,795 --> 00:18:29,922
I won't go against them
我不敢怎樣的…

220
00:18:31,466 --> 00:18:34,168
Go home
你回去吧！

This is the hunting ground
that belongs to me only

Get lost
你走開！

223
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:44,240
Chief... -Get lost!

224
00:18:57,191 --> 00:19:00,854
Dakis, have a drink

Go home and get yourself dead-drunk

We can't drink anymore

227
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,838
We already... -Drink!

228
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:12,806
The millet wine that we make

229
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:17,412
can set our people free

cry and laugh freely

233
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,017

莫那…

234
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,458
Father?

235
00:20:49,937 --> 00:20:55,043
Mouna, the tattoos on your face
are still so dark and clear
莫那！

Mouna? Look at the lines on that rock
…莫那！

It split into half
when struck by the lightening, didn't it?
你看那巨石的線條…
是被雷光削開的吧！

240
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:25,306
In the dim light at dusk
the lightening splits a rock into half
昏黑的天色下…雷光削巨石…

241
00:21:25,306 --> 00:21:28,798

如果殺得完的話
我們為什麼還要忍到現在？

00:26:47,695 --> 00:26:49,830
Let's fight them, Chief

Yeah! Let's fight them

303
00:26:55,636 --> 00:26:57,471
Young men..

304
00:26:57,471 --> 00:27:03,878
I hate the Japanese no less than you do
我對日本人的仇恨
不會少於你們…

305
00:27:03,878 --> 00:27:07,248
But do you realize that
只是你們知道行動之後…

306
00:27:07,248 --> 00:27:10,615
we're going to die after all this
and all our people will be wiped out?
我們一定會死…甚至滅族嗎？

307
00:27:11,452 --> 00:27:14,789
Our ancestors shed their blood
in exchange for our lives
我們的生命是祖先染血換來的

308
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:18,192
Now we're taking our children along
to the battlefield to shed blood
我們也要帶著子孫們一起染紅戰衣！

309
00:27:18,192 --> 00:27:20,126
We're Seediq Bale, aren't we?
我們是賽德克巴萊呀！

310
00:27:24,131 --> 00:27:25,428
Temu, does your father know you're here?
泰牧…

311
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,127
你父親知道你過來嗎？

312
00:27:28,803 --> 00:27:32,339
My father told me that I should ask Chief Mouna
我父親告訴我…
請莫那頭目幫忙…

313
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:34,341
to help us youngsters get our faces tattooed
在孩子們的臉上作印記！

so that the ancestors' spirits
guarding the rainbow bridge

will recognize us as the true Seediqs

316
00:28:03,604 --> 00:28:04,371
Father?
父親…

317
00:28:04,371 --> 00:28:07,738
If we want revenge,
it'd be the business of Mehebu Clan alone
如果說復仇，那是我馬赫坡的事

318
00:28:08,275 --> 00:28:10,511
But if we're offering a blood sacrifice
to our ancestors
但是如果要血祭祖靈的話…

319
00:28:10,511 --> 00:28:15,312

in Wushe
霧社十二個部落全部都要參加…

320

Keep it a secret before action
行動前先守住秘密！

321
00:28:19,753 --> 00:28:21,589
We must tell none of the elders,
children or women in all these clans
所有部落裡的老人、小孩、女人

322
00:28:21,589 --> 00:28:23,991
When did you..

I'm speaking here. Are you listening?

It's your idea and your responsibility
你又知道什麼？你起的頭你負責…

327

Inform the chiefs of all the 12 clans

and offer a blood sacrifice

331
00:29:03,531 --> 00:29:04,665
Our ancestors' spirits..

We're here for the guns. Sorry to disturb you

Wow! Lots of things to buy, huh?

Boss, we'll pay for it next time

No, you can't!

Wait! You're buying all these on credit?

Let's give them a hand
到外面幫忙！

really can't take it anymore?
莫那魯道這老酒鬼真的忍不住了？

before they all get dead drunk
我去召集年輕人準備了

What the hell was he up to?

That crazy boy spells nothing but trouble
整天瘋瘋癲癲的只會惹事…

without him, won't we?
不過…如果山上少了他
應該會很無趣吧！

我們辛苦忍辱把你們這些孩子養大
是為了要保住族群命脈

Chief... -We're not afraid of death

Even Chief Mouna agreed to do it

塔道頭目…

They can laugh at me for all I care
笑我怕死也沒關係

to join the battle. Period
我就是不准我荷戈社參戰！

368

But Chief.. -Chief!
頭目…頭目…

forever without guns or hunting grounds?
難道你要永遠當一個…
沒有槍、沒有獵場的獵人嗎？

I can't stand that old man

Go home

with those animal skulls now?
你現在只靠獸骨炫耀你的勇敢嗎？

英勇？
…我全部都已經留給你了！

to our Paran Clan

to keep the bloodline of your clan

不行…
父親再不回去，要天黑了…

Mouna knows everything about battles
…莫那…
這傢伙確實懂得戰鬥…

不過我已經老了，不能陪他去了…

可是…
可是我們羅多夫是不會缺席的…

408
00:36:26,106 --> 00:36:28,976
Good morning!

409
00:36:28,976 --> 00:36:31,774
Pihu! What's wrong with you?

410
00:36:33,347 --> 00:36:34,336
Pihu!
比荷…

411
00:36:34,948 --> 00:36:37,644
Good morning!

Why did you get all our hounds
to bark like crazy?
你幹嘛惹得我整個部落狗吠…

413
00:37:11,685 --> 00:37:15,177
Chief Mouna, didn't you say
that you wouldn't do it?
莫那頭目，你不是說你不會幹嗎？

414
00:37:17,057 --> 00:37:19,793
Do what? Who says I'm doing anything?
要幹什麼？…誰跟你說我要幹的？

415
00:37:19,793 --> 00:37:22,396
Dakis, you're nothing
but a police dog wearing a collar
達奇斯…
你這隻戴著項圈的警犬…

416
00:37:22,396 --> 00:37:24,531

as a persuader?

-Tado!

418
00:37:44,051 --> 00:37:48,954
Dakis, you haven't answered
my question from last time
達奇斯…
你上次還沒有回答我

419
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:53,760
When you die,
are you entering a Japanese shrine
你將來要進日本人的神社

420
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,422
or the heavenly home of our ancestors?
還是我們賽德克祖靈的家？

421
00:37:59,299 --> 00:38:02,936
Are you Dakis? Or Hanaoka Ichiro?
你是達奇斯？還是花岡一郎？

422
00:38:02,936 --> 00:38:05,639
I'm a true Seediq tribesman. I am!
我是真正的賽德克！我是…

423
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:07,074

-可是…
-是的話就換掉這身衣服

with us tomorrow
明天和我們一起血祭祖靈！

You know well
how many soldiers the Japanese have
你又不是不知道日本軍隊有多少…

426
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:21,284
You're going to get killed for nothing
這麼做只不過是白白犧牲而已…

427
00:38:22,923 --> 00:38:27,227
You told me the other day that there are
more Japanese people than..
你上次不是還說日本人比森林裡的…

428
00:38:27,227 --> 00:38:30,664

可是這麼濃的霧…
