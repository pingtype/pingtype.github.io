1
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:04,735
Get out!

2
00:00:07,075 --> 00:00:09,045
Get out! Hurry!

3
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:19,145
Inside the hut! Come on!

4
00:00:19,255 --> 00:00:20,125
Get in! Come on!

5
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:23,355
Out of here!

6
00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:25,985
Don't come in! Get out!

7
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,285
Come on! Run!

8
00:00:41,445 --> 00:00:42,275
Yes, sir

9
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:46,205
Is it Mehebu Clan?

10
00:00:46,315 --> 00:00:47,345
Yes, sir

11
00:00:50,285 --> 00:00:53,955
Aim all cannons at the Mehebu Forest

12
00:00:55,795 --> 00:00:59,665
End this battle before the sun's out

13
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:08,965
Tado! Kill me!

14
00:01:09,075 --> 00:01:10,435
Come on!

15
00:01:11,645 --> 00:01:13,835
It hurts so badly!

16
00:01:16,985 --> 00:01:18,505
Out of the way!

17
00:01:20,155 --> 00:01:22,815
Cut my head off! You hear me?

18
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:28,555
Get off him!

19
00:02:28,885 --> 00:02:31,255
It's beautiful

20
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,915
So beautiful

21
00:02:36,925 --> 00:02:38,895
So beautiful

22
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:57,945
Stop firing please

23
00:02:58,045 --> 00:02:59,645
They ran away

24
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:39,755
Fight till you drop! Seediq Bale!

25
00:04:07,555 --> 00:04:09,215
Fire the cannons! Fire!

26
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:12,785
We're under attack!

27
00:04:20,165 --> 00:04:23,185
You damned Japanese! Get out of our territory!

28
00:04:32,045 --> 00:04:33,805
You bastards! Get out!

29
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,955
That's one favor I did you Mehebus today
helping you drive our the intruders

30
00:05:03,205 --> 00:05:05,335
Out of my way! Let me kill them!

31
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:35,595
Temu, give me the bullets!

32
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:38,205
Come on! Look out!

33
00:05:45,985 --> 00:05:46,775
Climb up there!

34
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:57,555
Sine! Sine!

35
00:05:57,665 --> 00:05:59,185
Sine!

36
00:05:59,295 --> 00:06:03,235
Sine! Sine!

37
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:04,795
Stop!

38
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,295
Come back here!

39
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:08,265
You take care of him!

40
00:06:37,835 --> 00:06:40,165
Load the guns! Come on!

41
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:43,825
Pawan?

42
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:02,315
You Japanese are finished!

43
00:07:42,165 --> 00:07:44,225
Quick! - Catch him!

44
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:46,465
Off with his head!

45
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:47,995
Stop!

46
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,705
Don't let him slip away!

47
00:08:02,455 --> 00:08:04,215
Mouna Rudo!

48
00:08:04,955 --> 00:08:05,925
Stop running!

49
00:08:07,455 --> 00:08:09,255
Kill until our blood runs out!

50
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:12,125
Cut off their heads like true warriors!

51
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:15,625
The heavenly home of our ancestors,
here we come!

52
00:10:25,895 --> 00:10:27,885
I'm a chief, not your little brother

53
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,665
Iyung! Iyung!

54
00:10:50,555 --> 00:10:52,915
Don't touch it, lyung

55
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:54,715
Iyung!

56
00:10:58,765 --> 00:11:01,055
What are you doing? Move!

57
00:11:02,765 --> 00:11:04,525
Look out! It's falling down!

58
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:07,105
Pawan! Get out of there!

59
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:11,535
Pawan, get out now!

60
00:11:14,045 --> 00:11:14,975
Pawan!

61
00:11:15,515 --> 00:11:17,065
Iyung! Iyung!

62
00:11:17,185 --> 00:11:18,145
Are you alright?

63
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:19,975
Pawan, I've got a good gun

64
00:11:20,915 --> 00:11:21,645
What's wrong?

65
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:24,455
Batu! -Dakis!

66
00:11:26,455 --> 00:11:27,215
Move!

67
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:28,655
Ubus!

68
00:11:51,785 --> 00:11:53,775
Come on! The Japanese are out!

69
00:12:05,165 --> 00:12:06,325
Watch out over there!

70
00:12:14,005 --> 00:12:15,475
There's one behind him!

71
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,515
Don't go there!

72
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,315
Stop!

73
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:34,935
Bomb!

74
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,185
So you're Mouna Rudo

75
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:45,905
Now I see you clearly

76
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:52,335
Tado, how do we dodge those cannons?

77
00:17:58,315 --> 00:18:02,615
Chief, let this ghost lead the way

78
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,755
Fire!

79
00:19:09,555 --> 00:19:10,845
Look!

80
00:19:10,955 --> 00:19:14,185
Cherry blossoms everywhere!

81
00:20:06,345 --> 00:20:09,715
(Those who come forward voluntarily
will be spared)

82
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:12,735
(Come to the shelters to surrender)

83
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:25,455
l'm crossing the rainbow bridge

84
00:20:25,565 --> 00:20:30,395
l am Mouna Rudo

85
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:35,365
Look at the road l've trodden

86
00:20:40,145 --> 00:20:42,575
No one's ever gonna stop us

87
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,975
The determined warriors

88
00:20:45,085 --> 00:20:49,985
We're home with our enemy's heads

89
00:20:50,085 --> 00:20:55,185
We're true warriors, like budding pine leaves

90
00:21:07,635 --> 00:21:10,405
You must be starved

91
00:21:10,505 --> 00:21:12,535
and you must be exhausted

92
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,205
It's time to decide your future

93
00:21:18,385 --> 00:21:21,745
If you want to take your own life, do it

94
00:21:21,855 --> 00:21:24,085
If you want to turn yourself in, go ahead

95
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,185
If you want to keep fighting..

96
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:30,425
Tado..

97
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:33,855
My dear son..

98
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:38,165
The hero of Mehebu Clan

99
00:21:39,135 --> 00:21:42,265
Lead them to fight
until you use up all your bullets

100
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,705
Father! -Chief..

101
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:48,535
Warriors, forgive me

102
00:21:50,515 --> 00:21:51,575
Forgive me

103
00:21:53,785 --> 00:21:57,615
I don't want the Japanese to insult me
in front of my people

104
00:21:58,455 --> 00:21:59,715
Forgive me

105
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:05,615
I'll be waiting for you on the mountain peak

106
00:22:07,365 --> 00:22:10,385
Let's cross the rainbow bridge together
to the eternal hunting ground

107
00:22:14,935 --> 00:22:16,095
Father?

108
00:22:19,975 --> 00:22:23,245
Go..Seediq Bale!

109
00:22:59,715 --> 00:23:00,705
Chief Mouna?

110
00:23:02,155 --> 00:23:03,375
Bakan,

111
00:23:03,485 --> 00:23:07,045
bring over everyone from the chief's family

112
00:23:07,155 --> 00:23:11,095
Iwan, go back and tell our people in the cavern

113
00:23:11,195 --> 00:23:13,595
that those who don't want to surrender
may as well kill themselves

114
00:23:13,695 --> 00:23:15,165
I want to fight!

115
00:23:15,295 --> 00:23:17,125
Me too! -It's over!

116
00:23:17,835 --> 00:23:19,025
Mouna!

117
00:23:19,135 --> 00:23:22,535
Mouna, where's your ancestral spirit?

118
00:23:26,975 --> 00:23:29,635
Where is it?

119
00:23:33,815 --> 00:23:39,275
There could be greater suffering if you survived

120
00:23:56,475 --> 00:23:59,265
Wipe your face clean

121
00:24:30,605 --> 00:24:34,405
Thank you, women and children

122
00:24:34,505 --> 00:24:38,875
for sacrificing yourselves
to complete the men's souls

123
00:26:53,485 --> 00:26:56,975
She's awake!

124
00:26:57,085 --> 00:26:58,985
That savage woman is awake!

125
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:01,925
Officer Kabasoa!

126
00:27:03,495 --> 00:27:04,585
What's going on?
-That savage woman is awake

127
00:27:04,695 --> 00:27:06,215
Is it Mahung? -Yes, sir

128
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:08,325
Excuse me!

129
00:27:09,565 --> 00:27:10,795
Excuse me!

130
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,235
Let me through!

131
00:27:13,705 --> 00:27:16,065
Mahung! Mahung!

132
00:27:18,205 --> 00:27:19,295
Mahung..

133
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:24,365
I'm Kabasawa. I've been to your house

134
00:27:24,475 --> 00:27:27,075
Do you remember me, Mahung?

135
00:27:31,385 --> 00:27:33,875
Why did you save me?

136
00:27:35,825 --> 00:27:42,225
My husband and children are waiting for me

137
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:46,065
Mahong..

138
00:27:54,745 --> 00:27:55,735
100 dollars

139
00:27:56,715 --> 00:27:58,835
Son of a bitch! What are you doing?

140
00:27:58,945 --> 00:28:00,145
Don't put it on the desk!

141
00:28:01,485 --> 00:28:02,915
What are you looking at? Next!

142
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,145
It's only a child. You can't get 100 for it

143
00:28:05,255 --> 00:28:06,155
Get it off!

144
00:28:06,255 --> 00:28:08,655
It's Temu Mouna from Truwan Clan

145
00:28:08,755 --> 00:28:10,695
What child?
Don't you see the tattoos on his face?

146
00:28:10,795 --> 00:28:12,725
Put it over there! What a nuisance!

147
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:16,285
It's Tanah Robe, the Boarung chief

148
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:24,635
One of you from Gungu Clan killed our chief

149
00:28:47,165 --> 00:28:52,725
This one is Pawan Nawi from Mehebu Clan

150
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,365
Ukan! Tado!

151
00:28:57,475 --> 00:29:00,165
Where are you?

152
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:06,675
Where is that father going?

153
00:29:06,785 --> 00:29:12,515
The father carrying a child on his back

154
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:19,685
is setting out to shoot the two suns in the sky

155
00:29:19,795 --> 00:29:25,135
They go on and on for a long way

156
00:29:25,235 --> 00:29:37,875
The child grows up

157
00:29:37,975 --> 00:29:43,545
The father dies at an old age

158
00:29:43,655 --> 00:29:56,465
The child takes his father's bow and arrows

159
00:29:56,565 --> 00:30:02,365
The child follows his father's footsteps

160
00:30:02,475 --> 00:30:14,945
toward the rising suns

161
00:30:15,055 --> 00:30:20,885
He gets there at last

162
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:33,495
The child gets there at last

163
00:30:33,605 --> 00:30:39,135
The child shoots a sun down with an arrow

164
00:30:39,245 --> 00:30:51,275
The sun loses its rays

165
00:30:51,385 --> 00:30:56,725
The dead sun becomes the moon

166
00:30:56,825 --> 00:31:09,605
He's a sun-shooting hero

167
00:31:09,705 --> 00:31:15,235
The sun-shooting hero is returning home

168
00:31:15,345 --> 00:31:28,745
The sun-shooting hero has come a long,
long way

169
00:31:28,855 --> 00:31:34,555
The sun-shooting hero is home at last

170
00:31:34,665 --> 00:31:47,705
But the hero is already gray-headed

171
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:56,815
l am drunk today

172
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,975
l saw him on the way

173
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:00,785
The boy from the freezing winter

174
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:04,485
A fair-skinned boy like a budding pine leaf

175
00:32:04,595 --> 00:32:06,495
Let's dance together

176
00:32:06,595 --> 00:32:08,185
Let's enjoy ourselves

177
00:32:08,295 --> 00:32:11,735
l'm drunk today

178
00:32:11,835 --> 00:32:15,425
Young girls, let's dance together

179
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:21,335
Surrender? Why should we surrender?

180
00:32:22,845 --> 00:32:24,645
We've had our enemy's sake wine

181
00:32:25,845 --> 00:32:28,115
Doesn't that mean conciliation?

182
00:32:28,215 --> 00:32:30,275
Why do we have to surrender?

183
00:32:34,025 --> 00:32:35,485
Tado... -Say no more!

184
00:32:41,725 --> 00:32:43,525
Come on, drink with me

185
00:32:59,915 --> 00:33:00,845
Mahung, my little sister...

186
00:33:03,385 --> 00:33:06,015
it's much easier for me to die

187
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:09,925
than for you to go on living

188
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:13,085
But you must endure

189
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,495
and have lots of children

190
00:33:19,305 --> 00:33:22,825
Teach them everything
about the pride of our father

191
00:33:22,935 --> 00:33:28,235
Let your children have even more children

192
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:31,005
and more and more..

193
00:33:32,645 --> 00:33:36,605
Mahung, have lots of children

194
00:33:42,625 --> 00:33:48,115
Raise them up to be proud Seediqs
and to live on with pride

195
00:33:50,235 --> 00:33:51,785
Do you understand?

196
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:57,335
Father, Baso and I..

197
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:02,865
along with all our fallen people

198
00:34:05,245 --> 00:34:09,705
will be watching over you
from the rainbow bridge

199
00:34:15,295 --> 00:34:20,725
Look! The sun is so beautiful

200
00:34:36,345 --> 00:34:37,535
Oh, my wife!

201
00:34:38,345 --> 00:34:42,145
ls the wine ready now?

202
00:34:42,255 --> 00:34:46,015
Here l come, my wife and children

203
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:49,745
On my way to the heavenly home
of our ancestors

204
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:51,555
Wait a little longer for me please

205
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:53,525
l'll be seeing you soon

206
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:57,255
We're already on our way

207
00:34:57,365 --> 00:35:01,025
Oh my wife and children, wait a little longer

208
00:35:01,135 --> 00:35:04,535
Wait for us on the way
to the heavenly home of our ancestors

209
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:08,305
Oh my wife and children, wait a little longer

210
00:35:08,405 --> 00:35:11,905
We're almost there

211
00:35:12,015 --> 00:35:15,445
We're about to cross the road

212
00:35:15,555 --> 00:35:18,985
We'll be seeing you in no time

213
00:35:19,085 --> 00:35:22,455
Wait for us on the way
to the heavenly home of our ancestors

214
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:26,045
Oh my wife and children, wait a little longer

215
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:29,455
We're almost there

216
00:35:29,565 --> 00:35:32,865
We're about to cross the road

217
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:36,455
We'll be seeing you in no time

218
00:36:19,445 --> 00:36:23,085
(Pihu Sapu was beaten up to death)

219
00:36:23,085 --> 00:36:26,855
(in the detention house after he got caught)

220
00:36:39,705 --> 00:36:45,465
(Tado Mouna and the last surviving warriors
all committed suicide )

221
00:36:52,515 --> 00:36:56,675
(Mouna Rudo disappeared without a trace )

222
00:37:24,115 --> 00:37:31,675
300 warriors against thousands of soldiers

223
00:37:31,785 --> 00:37:34,775
Those survived the battle
killed themselves eventually

224
00:37:38,525 --> 00:37:46,225
Why did I see
in such a remote mountain area in Taiwan

225
00:37:46,335 --> 00:37:55,575
the bushido of samurais
that died over a century ago in Japan?

226
00:37:59,385 --> 00:38:09,315
Is it because the cherry blossoms here
are far too red?

227
00:38:10,325 --> 00:38:14,985
No, these flowers have bloomed early this year

228
00:38:18,365 --> 00:38:21,025
It isn't the season of cherry blossoms yet

229
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:43,595
(After the incident...)

230
00:38:43,595 --> 00:38:46,365
(Kojima Genji instigated the Seediqs
from Toda)

231
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,995
(to revenge the death of their chief
Temu Walis )

232
00:38:48,995 --> 00:38:51,735
(by killing all the remaining
defenseless tribesmen)

233
00:38:51,735 --> 00:38:54,365
(staying in the shelter during the night)

234
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:00,865
Out of the way!

235
00:39:00,975 --> 00:39:03,605
(The few surviving tribesmen were forced)
Hurry up!

236
00:39:03,645 --> 00:39:05,545
(to relocate to a compound along
Peikang River)

237
00:39:05,545 --> 00:39:06,145
(to relocate to a compound along
Peikang River)
Out of the way!

238
00:39:06,145 --> 00:39:07,015
(where the Japanese
could monitor them easily )
Out of the way!

239

(where the Japanese
could monitor them easily )

240
00:39:08,715 --> 00:39:11,385
(They burned down all their remaining houses )

241
00:39:11,385 --> 00:39:13,815
(before they left)

242
00:39:35,505 --> 00:39:40,875
(Four years later...)

243
00:40:49,215 --> 00:40:53,225
(Mouna Rudo's remains were found)

244
00:40:53,225 --> 00:40:57,355
(inside a cavern,
somewhere deep in the mountains )

245
00:41:00,365 --> 00:41:02,495
(Half of his body rotted to skeleton)

246
00:41:02,495 --> 00:41:07,625
(while the other half
was weathered to a mummy )

247
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,175
(In the following year...)

248
00:41:11,175 --> 00:41:13,975
(the Japanese publicly displayed
his remains and weapons )

249
00:41:13,975 --> 00:41:16,745
(in a wooden crate at the exhibition
celebrating the completion)

250
00:41:16,745 --> 00:41:19,015
(of Nenggao City Hall construction project)

251

Ah, it's for real
(of Nenggao City Hall construction project)

252
00:41:19,985 --> 00:41:22,315
Ah, it's for real

253
00:41:22,315 --> 00:41:24,815
Ah, it's for real
(After that,
his remains disappeared once again)

254
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:28,855
l'll be arriving soon

at the heavenly home of our ancestors

257
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:39,955
Yes, it's for real

258
00:41:40,905 --> 00:41:46,395
Reminisce the people from the past

259
00:41:46,505 --> 00:41:47,345
Here l am

260
00:41:47,345 --> 00:41:49,875
Here l am
(After the second disappearance )

261
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:51,975
Here l am

(after 43 years, he finally returned
to his hometown Wushe )

269
00:42:07,595 --> 00:42:07,825
We're the true Seediq Bale
(after 43 years, he finally returned
to his hometown Wushe )

270
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:11,065
We're the true Seediq Bale
(to be buried properly )

271
00:42:11,065 --> 00:42:12,965
We're the true Seediq Bale

272
00:42:13,065 --> 00:42:18,365
We go hunting in the mountains

273
00:42:18,475 --> 00:42:23,605
We share food in our clan

274
00:42:23,715 --> 00:42:29,245
We fetch water from the creeks

275
00:42:29,355 --> 00:42:34,115
l'm willing to give my life for these

276
00:42:34,225 --> 00:42:39,315
Oh, creek! Be quiet!

277
00:42:39,425 --> 00:42:44,455
Sisin babblers are singing

278
00:42:44,565 --> 00:42:49,505
Sing us a beautiful song please

279
00:42:49,605 --> 00:42:54,565
Sing for our people

280
00:42:54,675 --> 00:42:59,635
a song of our ancestral spirit

l'm willing to give my life too

282
00:43:04,785 --> 00:43:09,775
(List of Angel Fund contributors)
When the lightening rifts the rock

283
00:43:09,895 --> 00:43:14,795
a rainbow appears

284
00:43:14,895 --> 00:43:19,765
and a proud man emerges

285
00:43:19,865 --> 00:43:24,775
A proud man emerges

286

Who is this man so proud?

A Seediq Bale

289
00:43:53,935 --> 00:44:01,175
Once upon a time on Mt. White Stone
there was a big tree called Pusu Qhuni

290
00:44:01,275 --> 00:44:06,975
The tree trunk was half wood, half stone

291
00:44:07,085 --> 00:44:14,215
One day, a boy and a girl were born
from the tree trunk

292
00:44:14,325 --> 00:44:17,225
Then the couple gave birth to lots of children

293
00:44:17,325 --> 00:44:21,695
and here we are, the Seediq Bale

294
00:45:05,575 --> 00:45:18,245
Behold! The beautiful rainbow over the hilltop

295
00:45:18,355 --> 00:45:25,085
My wife and children,
have you brewed the wine?

296
00:45:25,195 --> 00:45:37,405
Drink it!
The wine we offer to our ancestors' spirits

297
00:45:37,505 --> 00:45:50,285
Behold! What beautiful rainbow!
My ancestors are calling me

298
00:45:50,385 --> 00:45:57,515
My wife and children! Are you on your way
to meet our ancestors spirits?

299
00:45:57,625 --> 00:46:06,265
We should get going too

300
00:46:06,365 --> 00:46:19,215
Stand still,
our people who keep the bloodline going

301
00:46:19,315 --> 00:46:25,585
We will be proud like a true Seediq

302
00:46:25,685 --> 00:46:35,355
Our bodiless spirits will be watching over you
from the rainbow bridge

Tell every child to live on forever
