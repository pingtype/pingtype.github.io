Be still!

00:00:42,866 --> 00:00:45,266
(Can they still hold the sand

Get out!

Who the hell let you in?

But do you realize that

16
00:01:05,556 --> 00:01:09,026
(Touch your angry forehead)
we're going to die after all this
and all our people will be wiped out?

Get everybody here right now

66
00:05:10,406 --> 00:05:13,166
Massacre...
-Gather all the policemen right away!

67
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:16,326
The Wushe savages are hunting heads!
-All the policemen gather up!

68
00:05:16,406 --> 00:05:19,106
All the Japanese in the mountains
have been killed

69
00:05:19,206 --> 00:05:20,546
And all the police stations
have been burned down

70
00:05:20,646 --> 00:05:22,836
Only one of the Japanese survived

71
00:05:22,946 --> 00:05:25,436
Go back home! Come on! Hurry up!

72

The Wushe savages are coming down
to kill more people

Don't get caught -You bastard!

76
00:05:32,126 --> 00:05:33,916
What are you talking about?

77
00:05:51,946 --> 00:05:53,566
The Japanese knew already

78
00:06:02,086 --> 00:06:04,676
The savages are likely
to charge all the way into Puli

79
00:06:04,786 --> 00:06:09,246
We're afraid even the plainsmen
might seize the opportunity to join in the revolt

80
00:06:09,356 --> 00:06:10,916
This is an emergency

81
00:06:11,026 --> 00:06:14,056
All county governments please send in
their armies and police forces

82
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,226
to lay siege to Wushe from Hualien and Tunghih

83
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:18,426
And I want to know if the Governor-general
can dispatch the troops

84
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:20,506
from Taipei and Tainan right away

85

Come on! Hurry up! Put all the stuff away

88
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,606
This way! Hurry up!

89
00:06:30,716 --> 00:06:32,736
The family members of the soldiers
to the feedstock department

00:06:32,846 --> 00:06:34,786
The family members of the police
to the mechanical department

91
00:06:34,886 --> 00:06:37,616
The family members of the officeholders
to sugar extraction department! Come on!

00:06:37,726 --> 00:06:38,986
You too. Come on!

Come on!
-Savages will always be savages

94
00:06:41,156 --> 00:06:42,526
You're nothing but beasts

95
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:45,786
I never know what you savages are thinking

96
00:06:45,896 --> 00:06:48,526
It's time for me to teach you a lesson

97
00:06:49,836 --> 00:06:51,166
Speak Japanese!

98
00:06:52,006 --> 00:06:54,166
No one understands your savage language

99
00:06:56,206 --> 00:06:57,796
Your tribesmen have revolted

100
00:06:58,706 --> 00:07:01,546
No more peaceful life for you

101
00:07:07,316 --> 00:07:08,046
It's chilly!

102
00:07:09,886 --> 00:07:11,716
Come on, Pihu!

103
00:07:11,826 --> 00:07:13,556
Get a larger chunk of wood

104
00:07:18,926 --> 00:07:20,156
Good morning

105
00:07:21,436 --> 00:07:22,366
Good morning

106
00:07:28,206 --> 00:07:29,296
Chief!

107
00:07:31,376 --> 00:07:33,896
It's chilly out here

108
00:07:34,016 --> 00:07:38,916
Why aren't you inside the house by the fire
instead of weaving this bag?

109
00:07:40,016 --> 00:07:43,916
It's the first snow of this winter
How could I miss it?

110
00:07:49,956 --> 00:07:53,326
The snow has come early this year

111
00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:01,636
Takun, what are you doing?

112
00:08:04,106 --> 00:08:04,906
Takun!

113
00:08:11,046 --> 00:08:17,476
Temu, your son will perform well
on sports day again, won't he?

114
00:08:17,586 --> 00:08:20,076
Takun, what's going on?

115
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:21,656
You've got blood all over your body

116
00:08:23,966 --> 00:08:24,946
Takun!

117
00:08:30,506 --> 00:08:31,556
Takun!

118
00:08:33,036 --> 00:08:34,366
What's wrong with you?

119
00:08:35,136 --> 00:08:39,596
Chief, today Mouna Rudo from Mehebu Clan

120
00:08:39,706 --> 00:08:43,806
led the Seediqs from Tgdaya
to offer a blood sacrifice to our ancestors

121
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:47,006
They've occupied the whole Wushe region

122
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:49,206
We Seediqs from Toda should join them as well

123
00:08:50,926 --> 00:08:52,756
Let's kill this Japanese man!

124
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:54,016
No way!

125
00:08:58,196 --> 00:09:02,856
Kojima is our friend
He's a good Japanese, not a bad one

126
00:09:02,966 --> 00:09:03,866
Go away!

127
00:09:03,966 --> 00:09:04,766
Temu!

128
00:09:05,636 --> 00:09:08,506
You're the chief of all the Seediqs from Toda

129
00:09:08,606 --> 00:09:13,206
Why don't you drive the Japanese away
and lead your own people?

130
00:09:13,306 --> 00:09:16,576
Why should you expect
the good Japanese to rule us?

131
00:09:16,676 --> 00:09:19,516
He's right! We don't have any Japanese friends

132
00:09:19,616 --> 00:09:20,846
Don't come any closer!

133
00:09:36,736 --> 00:09:41,226
Kojima, we'll let you answer the phone

134
00:09:41,336 --> 00:09:45,836
But do you have the guts to do it?

135
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:51,646
Have I been bad to you?

136
00:09:52,486 --> 00:09:54,346
Have I been bad to you?

137
00:09:55,556 --> 00:09:56,316
Kojima..

138
00:09:58,086 --> 00:10:01,076
Is this how you repay me?

139
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:04,386
I can't fight back if you want me dead

140
00:10:05,696 --> 00:10:09,896
But the Japanese government
will do anything to punish you

141
00:10:12,706 --> 00:10:15,106
We might as well die together

142
00:10:17,046 --> 00:10:18,026
Kojima!

143
00:10:22,946 --> 00:10:26,816
We have airplanes, but do you?

144
00:10:27,316 --> 00:10:31,416
We have machineguns and cannons,
but do you?

145
00:10:32,886 --> 00:10:37,416
Think about
how Mouna Rudo used to insult you

146
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:41,796
Last time when we're out hunting
they threatened to kill you all

147
00:10:41,896 --> 00:10:43,956
Don't you remember?

148
00:10:45,366 --> 00:10:47,596
Are you willing to die
with them in the battlefield?

149
00:10:48,976 --> 00:10:50,806
Temu Walis,

150
00:10:50,906 --> 00:10:53,236
you won't have the chance to grow up

151
00:11:02,156 --> 00:11:02,986
Hello?

152
00:11:06,486 --> 00:11:07,456
Hello?

153
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:10,826
Take it easy! There's more!

154
00:11:11,626 --> 00:11:13,616
Hurry up!

155
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:14,996
Come on!

156
00:11:18,036 --> 00:11:19,506
Come on!

157
00:11:23,706 --> 00:11:25,506
Chief Mouna?

158
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:41,486
Thank you

159
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:45,626
Thank you

160
00:11:46,296 --> 00:11:47,126
Thank you

161
00:11:48,136 --> 00:11:50,226
Thank you

162
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:53,206
Thank you. Thank you all

163
00:11:54,236 --> 00:11:55,136
Thank you

164
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:56,336
Thank you -Come on!

165
00:11:57,506 --> 00:11:59,036
Thank you. Thank you all

166
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:02,436
Thank you

167
00:12:02,546 --> 00:12:03,406
Tado!

168
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:05,206
Sapu, where's my father?

169
00:12:06,816 --> 00:12:10,186
What's going on? Why did they want us back?

170
00:12:18,226 --> 00:12:21,166
Father, why did you give up Hakaw Supeitei?

171
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:22,856
So you're back!

172
00:12:28,106 --> 00:12:30,366
Come on, let's go back to our clan

173
00:12:30,476 --> 00:12:33,776
Back to our clan? You're giving up here as well?

174
00:12:33,876 --> 00:12:38,776
Tado, you can't think like the Japanese
when fighting them

175
00:12:38,886 --> 00:12:41,286
You have to think like the wind

176
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,856
The wind?

177
00:12:44,226 --> 00:12:46,216
The wind is invisible

178
00:12:54,896 --> 00:12:59,026
Baso, give up everything, everyone
and come back to the clan with me

179
00:13:00,536 --> 00:13:01,296
Japanese airplanes!

180
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,066
Over there! -Fire!

181
00:13:05,846 --> 00:13:07,906
Shoot it! Come on!

182
00:13:11,546 --> 00:13:12,516
Are you so scared?

183
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:19,076
Are you really so scared?

184
00:13:29,236 --> 00:13:33,936
I went head hunting for the first time
when I was 15

185
00:13:35,876 --> 00:13:39,536
I was so nervous
that my arms and legs were trembling

186
00:13:40,846 --> 00:13:45,246
But my eyes were sharp as arrows

187
00:13:46,386 --> 00:13:48,546
As soon as I cut the enemy's head off

188
00:13:49,886 --> 00:13:52,656
I forgot what it was like to be scared

189
00:13:54,156 --> 00:13:55,956
because I knew I'd go back to my clan

190
00:13:57,196 --> 00:14:01,186
to feast and celebrate, being treated as a hero

191
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:05,696
because I knew that all my people

192
00:14:05,806 --> 00:14:10,676
male and female, young and old

193
00:14:10,776 --> 00:14:13,506
would respect me for my bravery

194
00:14:13,606 --> 00:14:17,736
However, it's different this time

195
00:14:23,156 --> 00:14:25,956
We successfully offered a blood sacrifice
to our ancestors today

196
00:14:28,226 --> 00:14:31,356
and are now qualified
to stride over the rainbow bridge

197
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:36,426
but what awaits us now is not a festive feast

198
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:39,296
but to choose how we die

199
00:14:39,406 --> 00:14:41,196
Run the electricity!

200
00:14:44,376 --> 00:14:46,736
Before we initiated the revolt

201
00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:51,006
you knew it'd turn out like this, didn't you?

202
00:14:51,216 --> 00:14:52,976
My children..

203
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,656
...don't be scared

204
00:14:57,926 --> 00:15:01,656
You've been very brave today

205
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,016
Our ancestors' spirits have seen it all

206
00:15:05,126 --> 00:15:08,466
But the battle to come is the real one

207
00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:12,526
It's a battle that will terrify the invaders

208
00:15:12,906 --> 00:15:14,136
Someone's here!

209
00:15:14,236 --> 00:15:18,766
Sisin babblers in the forests
are driving off the scavenging crows

210
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:24,006
The rainbow will be more beautiful
in the sunlight after the rain

211
00:15:26,016 --> 00:15:28,606
It's a bunch of Hans from Wushe

212
00:15:30,756 --> 00:15:32,746
Lock them all up!

213
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,296
My children..

214
00:15:44,406 --> 00:15:46,396
...don't be afraid

215
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:53,236
Our ancestors' spirits know we're good warriors
guarding our hunting grounds

216
00:15:54,676 --> 00:15:57,776
The blood stains on your hands can prove it

217
00:15:57,886 --> 00:16:00,906
Every one of you is a Seediq Bale

218
00:16:02,186 --> 00:16:07,986
Remember, you have to be proud

219
00:16:08,096 --> 00:16:11,286
Let's cross the rainbow bridge together

220
00:16:58,076 --> 00:17:00,306
Nobody's guarding here

221
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:03,316
Not a single soul on this path

222
00:17:06,346 --> 00:17:08,116
How could it be?

223
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:15,846
Advance!

224
00:17:15,956 --> 00:17:17,016
Wait!

225
00:17:17,126 --> 00:17:19,356
Stop! Halt!

226
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:24,536
Don't rush uphill
I know these savages all too well

227
00:17:35,116 --> 00:17:37,136
What a chilly night!

228
00:17:39,616 --> 00:17:41,946
It's warm here

229
00:18:04,276 --> 00:18:06,106
Savages!

230
00:18:13,386 --> 00:18:14,846
Hold the fire!

231
00:18:17,316 --> 00:18:26,056
l'm trekking over the high mountains

232
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:35,336
The creek water is so thick and muddy

233
00:18:35,436 --> 00:18:44,706
l can't help but shed my tears

234
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:54,126
l'm walking along a wide road

235
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:02,156
He's asleep

236
00:19:10,206 --> 00:19:12,076
Ichiro?

237
00:19:12,176 --> 00:19:16,006
Today is our wedding anniversary

238
00:19:16,116 --> 00:19:18,206
You remember, don't you?

239
00:19:23,186 --> 00:19:32,456
We're walking on
with perseverance and determination

240
00:19:32,566 --> 00:19:41,436
We can't fall asleep anymore

241
00:19:41,536 --> 00:19:50,636
Let's go back to the heavenly home
of our ancestors

242
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:53,616
Kojima!

243
00:19:54,256 --> 00:19:55,686
Long time no see

244
00:19:56,116 --> 00:19:57,016
Captain!

245
00:19:58,486 --> 00:19:59,886
Let me introduce you, Captain

246
00:20:00,526 --> 00:20:03,256
This is the chief of Tnbarah Clan, Temu Walis

247
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:07,286
Got a good head on his shoulders

248
00:20:09,496 --> 00:20:10,466
Kojima?

249
00:20:15,336 --> 00:20:19,236
I heard all your family were killed in the venue?

250
00:20:19,346 --> 00:20:21,306
We will seek revenge

251
00:20:54,206 --> 00:20:56,336
Attack!

252
00:21:16,866 --> 00:21:19,566
Officer, nothing here

253
00:21:22,206 --> 00:21:23,606
Officer Goto!

254
00:21:33,846 --> 00:21:37,346
What the hell are these savages up to?

255
00:21:48,636 --> 00:21:51,426
The Japanese are coming!

256
00:22:31,906 --> 00:22:33,896
Look behind you -Yeah

257
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,506
This clan is over here

258
00:22:38,616 --> 00:22:41,446
This clan is over there

259
00:22:41,556 --> 00:22:44,546
Behind them is a creek

260
00:22:47,056 --> 00:22:50,586
Where do the Hans live? -The Hans..

261
00:22:52,296 --> 00:22:54,316
We're under attack! Duck!

262
00:22:54,436 --> 00:22:55,796
Hide!

263
00:23:11,216 --> 00:23:13,116
Awata! Awata!

264
00:23:13,216 --> 00:23:16,986
Contact the Oizumi Squad
and find out where they are now

265
00:23:29,636 --> 00:23:32,296
This is Wushe Substation

266
00:23:32,406 --> 00:23:34,926
This is Oizumi Squad

267
00:23:35,506 --> 00:23:37,436
We're now by Suku Creek

268
00:23:37,536 --> 00:23:40,336
We're ambushed by the savages.
We need back up

269
00:23:40,446 --> 00:23:42,206
We're stuck in the creek water

270
00:23:47,346 --> 00:23:51,186
Oizumi Squad..

271
00:23:53,326 --> 00:23:54,116
Captain?

272
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:57,786
Assemble a banzai squad for a suicide charge

273
00:24:01,596 --> 00:24:03,426
Where is Yamada Police Squad?

274
00:24:39,706 --> 00:24:40,826
Charge!

275
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:45,866
Pihu, let's go!

276
00:24:58,586 --> 00:25:00,316
Watch out! Dodge!

277
00:25:00,426 --> 00:25:02,946
Duck! Seek cover!

278
00:25:21,746 --> 00:25:24,546
The women and children
from Boarung Clan are all here

279
00:25:25,716 --> 00:25:26,976
Come on, let's go!

280
00:25:33,326 --> 00:25:36,556
Have you packed up enough clothes, Mahung?

281
00:25:36,656 --> 00:25:38,026
Yes, I have

282
00:25:38,796 --> 00:25:41,956
Pawan, you kids know how to get there

283
00:25:42,066 --> 00:25:48,296
Take the Boarung women and children along
with those of us that are ready

284
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:50,566
Baso, I'm no longer a child

285
00:25:52,576 --> 00:25:55,566
Don't let the dogs follow us
We don't have enough food

286
00:26:02,116 --> 00:26:05,886
Mahung, are you ready? Is it heavy?

287
00:26:09,426 --> 00:26:12,956
Mahung, you go ahead with Pawan and others

288
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:14,996
I'll wait for Sapu

289
00:26:15,096 --> 00:26:16,996
Why is everyone in here?

290
00:26:19,006 --> 00:26:20,866
Mother, don't touch that!

291
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:31,076
You're out of your minds!
The men in this house have all gone mad

292
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,576
Go ahead to Paran Clan, Obing

293
00:26:37,686 --> 00:26:39,216
No!

294
00:26:39,326 --> 00:26:41,586
Jiro, let me stay with you

295
00:26:41,696 --> 00:26:43,926
Jiro!

296
00:26:44,026 --> 00:26:46,586
Let go of me!
-All pregnant women go to Paran Clan

297
00:26:46,696 --> 00:26:49,726
Auntie, I'm the wife of a policeman

298
00:26:49,836 --> 00:26:52,926
but I'm the daughter of the Gungu Chief as well

299
00:26:53,036 --> 00:26:56,026
Auntie, let go of me!

300
00:26:56,136 --> 00:26:56,966
Give birth to your child in Paran Clan

301
00:26:57,076 --> 00:27:00,306
Jiro! I want to stay with you!

302
00:27:00,406 --> 00:27:03,346
I don't want to go there, Auntie!

303
00:27:03,446 --> 00:27:06,936
Give birth to your child in Paran Clan

304
00:27:09,686 --> 00:27:12,416
They're all pregnant

305
00:27:12,526 --> 00:27:14,926
The Japanese won't harm them

306
00:28:48,156 --> 00:28:49,136
Pawan!

307
00:28:50,556 --> 00:28:52,016
Pawan!

308
00:28:54,356 --> 00:28:55,486
What is it?

309
00:28:57,556 --> 00:29:02,796
The cavern is right up ahead
You can carry these over by yourselves

310
00:29:03,966 --> 00:29:06,396
We have to go now

311
00:29:08,276 --> 00:29:09,826
But where to?

312
00:29:15,476 --> 00:29:20,776
No, Mother! -Grandmother!

313
00:29:20,886 --> 00:29:24,616
Mother! -Grandmother!

314
00:29:24,716 --> 00:29:26,946
No, Mother! -Grandmother!

315
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,646
What are you doing?

316
00:29:29,756 --> 00:29:31,126
Mother, don't!

317
00:29:31,226 --> 00:29:33,956
Grandmother! -What are you doing?

318
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:37,466
Chief Mouna and others will be here soon

319
00:29:37,566 --> 00:29:41,966
Grandmother! -Mother!

320
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:46,596
You'll have to fight the Japanese for a long time

321
00:29:46,706 --> 00:29:49,646
There's not enough food for all of us

322
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:50,976
What are you talking about?

323
00:29:51,076 --> 00:29:53,986
Chief Mouna told us we're going to
fight our decisive battle soon

324
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:56,576
Grandmother!

325
00:29:56,686 --> 00:29:57,846
Pawan!

326
00:29:59,186 --> 00:30:04,456
I'm so glad that you're a warrior now
guarding our hunting grounds

327
00:30:04,556 --> 00:30:07,526
We'll be waiting for you
at the other end of the rainbow bridge

328
00:30:07,626 --> 00:30:11,426
You'll be meeting us
after you finish your glorious battles

329
00:30:11,536 --> 00:30:13,226
Stop following us!

330
00:30:13,336 --> 00:30:15,866
Fight for your hunting grounds -Mother!

331
00:30:15,976 --> 00:30:20,776
Grandmother, don't you want me anymore?

332
00:30:20,876 --> 00:30:23,816
Mother!

333
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:25,936
Mother!

334
00:30:26,046 --> 00:30:28,776
Pawan, please tell my husband Watan

335
00:30:28,886 --> 00:30:32,516
that I'll have the wine ready for him
at the other end of the rainbow bridge

336
00:30:32,626 --> 00:30:37,146
Watan is building up huts in the cavern
You can go tell him yourself

337
00:30:38,156 --> 00:30:40,216
Lubi! Lubi!

338
00:30:40,326 --> 00:30:42,556
Stop following us! -Mother!

339
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:45,036
Don't follow us! -Mother, don't!

340
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:48,066
Please... -Mother!

341
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:50,466
Don't cry -Grandmother!

342
00:30:50,576 --> 00:30:52,666
Listen to me..

343
00:30:52,776 --> 00:30:55,296
you're a grownup man now

344
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:56,246
Go on!

345
00:30:56,346 --> 00:30:58,646
Grandmother! -To the battlefield!

346
00:30:58,746 --> 00:31:01,076
Fight for your hunting grounds!
-Grandmother!

347
00:31:01,186 --> 00:31:02,476
To the battlefield!

348
00:31:05,326 --> 00:31:08,816
Grandmother!

349
00:31:08,926 --> 00:31:10,986
Mother! -Grandmother!

350
00:31:12,826 --> 00:31:14,886
Mother!

351
00:31:14,996 --> 00:31:16,826
Mother!

352
00:31:16,936 --> 00:31:22,376
Don't go, Mother! -Grandmother!

353
00:31:25,576 --> 00:31:27,336
Mother..

354
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:38,716
With tears in my eyes

355
00:31:38,826 --> 00:31:47,156
l'm walking along a wide road

356
00:31:47,266 --> 00:31:56,136
l beseech you

357
00:31:56,236 --> 00:32:05,166
Tell me if your hearts are at peace

358
00:32:05,286 --> 00:32:14,246
Oh, poor innocent children

359
00:32:14,356 --> 00:32:23,236
What's the matter with you?

360
00:32:23,336 --> 00:32:31,866
We're really exhausted

361
00:33:35,376 --> 00:33:36,596
Hanako?

362
00:33:41,106 --> 00:33:46,706
You look just as pretty
as you were on our wedding day

363
00:34:15,976 --> 00:34:24,116
Good boy! Close your eyes!

364
00:34:58,416 --> 00:35:03,376
My child, let's go together

365
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:12,456
Jiro?

366
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:16,936
Are we the subjects of Japan's Mikado?

367
00:36:18,536 --> 00:36:20,966
Or the descendants of the Seediq ancestors?

368
00:36:24,806 --> 00:36:27,036
Do it

369
00:36:27,146 --> 00:36:30,046
Cut it up and end your conflicts
right here and now

370
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,906
We don't have to go anywhere once we're dead

371
00:36:33,016 --> 00:36:35,416
Let's both be free wandering spirits

372
00:36:50,866 --> 00:36:52,456
Thank you

373
00:38:01,936 --> 00:38:04,026
This way please, General

374
00:38:15,016 --> 00:38:17,486
This is Officer Kabasoa, sir

375
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:21,246
He's a local policeman
and he knows the Wushe savages very well

376
00:38:21,356 --> 00:38:23,756
Then why are you still alive?

377
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:30,066
He was not there when the incident happened

378
00:38:40,546 --> 00:38:42,706
General, according to our investigation

379
00:38:42,816 --> 00:38:46,406
there are six clans involved in the revolt
over 300 warriors in all

380
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:48,516
Warriors?

381
00:38:50,586 --> 00:38:52,716
You call them 'warriors'

382
00:38:54,286 --> 00:38:57,816
Each of these clans took actions separately

383
00:38:57,926 --> 00:38:59,446
at dawn and annihilated
the local police stations

384
00:38:59,566 --> 00:39:02,296
Then they got together to besiege Wushe

385
00:39:02,396 --> 00:39:05,496
That's why we don't think it incidental

386
00:39:05,606 --> 00:39:08,866
They had been planning it carefully
from the beginning

387
00:39:10,736 --> 00:39:14,036
Planning it carefully?

388
00:39:14,146 --> 00:39:16,266
Mr. Kabasoa?

389
00:39:16,376 --> 00:39:19,366
Don't you think
you're overestimating these savages?

390
00:39:19,486 --> 00:39:26,246
General, all our reinforcements
were under fatal attacks yesterday

391
00:39:27,126 --> 00:39:28,956
...including here

392
00:39:38,906 --> 00:39:43,066
This is nothing but animal-like savagery

393
00:39:45,946 --> 00:39:49,876
Once the rain stops,
we'll besiege them immediately

394
00:39:49,976 --> 00:39:50,676
Yes, sir!

395
00:39:53,716 --> 00:39:59,716
(Headquarters of Kamada Detachment)

396
00:40:48,106 --> 00:40:49,336
Chief,

397
00:40:49,436 --> 00:40:52,406
are we going for the decisive battle tomorrow?

398
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,786
Ah, it hurts!

399
00:41:11,896 --> 00:41:15,826
Chief, the wounds are still fresh

400
00:41:24,376 --> 00:41:28,106
Pawan, you're not a child anymore

401
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:38,516
Chief, can we fight the decisive battle now?

402
00:42:07,746 --> 00:42:08,476
What's happening?

403
00:42:09,756 --> 00:42:10,736
Give me the gun!

404
00:42:11,916 --> 00:42:13,406
Hurry up!

405
00:42:19,826 --> 00:42:21,856
Let's go!

406
00:42:33,006 --> 00:42:34,096
Hurry up!

407
00:42:35,376 --> 00:42:36,276
Be careful!

408
00:42:37,576 --> 00:42:40,576
Go over there! Be careful!

409
00:42:50,826 --> 00:42:53,626
Stop! The savages!

410
00:43:00,206 --> 00:43:01,496
Stop running!

411
00:43:09,816 --> 00:43:10,976
Over there!

412
00:43:17,016 --> 00:43:18,416
What the hell?

413
00:43:23,756 --> 00:43:24,726
Fire!

414
00:43:29,696 --> 00:43:34,966
Retreat! All retreat!

415
00:43:39,206 --> 00:43:40,676
Hurry up and run!

416
00:43:59,996 --> 00:44:03,226
Seek covers! -Down there!

417
00:44:04,996 --> 00:44:06,486
Signalman, call for reinforcements

418
00:44:07,806 --> 00:44:10,536
Retreat downhill! Hide!

419
00:44:11,206 --> 00:44:12,966
Out of the way!

420
00:44:43,236 --> 00:44:44,706
Watch out!

421
00:44:45,476 --> 00:44:47,566
Quite slippery here

422
00:44:52,386 --> 00:44:53,716
Are you alright?

423
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,746
Halt, everyone!

424
00:45:09,366 --> 00:45:11,626
Jump!

425
00:45:47,566 --> 00:45:48,896
Machine gun!

426
00:45:49,006 --> 00:45:49,866
Step back! -Take aim!

427
00:45:49,976 --> 00:45:51,166
You're aiming too high! Hold on to your guns!

428
00:45:52,206 --> 00:45:54,436
Come on, fire it,
Sapu! What are you waiting for?

429
00:45:54,546 --> 00:45:56,376
I can't fire it

430
00:46:00,086 --> 00:46:01,206
Move over! I'll do it!

431
00:46:02,986 --> 00:46:04,976
Come on! Hurry up!

432
00:46:05,716 --> 00:46:07,746
What the hell? Fell asleep or something?

433
00:46:09,056 --> 00:46:10,286
Over there! Come on!

434
00:46:10,396 --> 00:46:11,616
He's gone!

435
00:46:12,396 --> 00:46:15,026
If I aim at the rock deliberately

436
00:46:15,126 --> 00:46:17,856
will the bullet bounce off
and hit the officer over there?

437
00:46:18,766 --> 00:46:19,926
Why don't you give it a try?

438
00:46:23,976 --> 00:46:26,596
No, it won't

439
00:46:26,706 --> 00:46:29,936
Have you two got too many bullets?

440
00:46:30,046 --> 00:46:33,846
No, but that is a military officer
with a katana sword

441
00:46:43,026 --> 00:46:46,616
Chief, Tado robbed a couple of machineguns

442
00:46:46,726 --> 00:46:51,326
Chief Mouna asked us to bring you one and..

443
00:46:51,436 --> 00:46:53,926
here's the ammunition and..

444
00:46:54,036 --> 00:46:55,896
and this bag of sweet potatoes

445
00:46:57,506 --> 00:47:00,336
Kids nowadays are so weak

446
00:47:00,446 --> 00:47:03,636
Look how they pant with so little running

447
00:47:05,316 --> 00:47:07,216
Do you know how to use it?

448
00:47:09,216 --> 00:47:12,586
I don't think this machinegun works

449
00:47:15,956 --> 00:47:18,616
Why did you give me one that doesn't work?

450
00:47:22,796 --> 00:47:24,926
That damned Mouna!

451
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:29,296
Chief Dahdo..

452
00:47:30,576 --> 00:47:32,936
My Paran relatives told me..

453
00:47:35,346 --> 00:47:38,806
that your entire family committed suicide

454
00:47:46,586 --> 00:47:50,926
Chief Dahdo, a bigger and more powerful army
is coming our way

455
00:47:51,026 --> 00:47:52,956
They have lots of cannons

456
00:48:06,706 --> 00:48:10,046
Pawan, when I was young

457
00:48:10,146 --> 00:48:13,276
I was no less strong or brave
than your Mehebu Chief Mouna Rudo

458
00:48:13,386 --> 00:48:14,716
you understand?

459
00:48:18,586 --> 00:48:23,546
Awi, lead the group and retreat to Rkudaya

460
00:48:28,566 --> 00:48:29,426
Chief!

461
00:48:29,536 --> 00:48:31,526
Chief!

462
00:48:38,006 --> 00:48:39,736
Chief! Chief!

463
00:48:42,676 --> 00:48:44,736
Retreat! To Rkudaya!

464
00:48:44,846 --> 00:48:46,076
Give it to me! Let's go!

465
00:48:46,186 --> 00:48:48,546
Retreat to Rkudaya! Our chief's dead!

466
00:48:48,646 --> 00:48:51,246
Come on!

467
00:48:53,626 --> 00:48:55,686
Pihu, come on!

468
00:49:04,936 --> 00:49:06,996
Retreat to Rkudaya!

469
00:49:07,106 --> 00:49:09,366
Come on! To Rkudaya!

470
00:49:09,476 --> 00:49:11,636
Come on! Let's go!

471
00:49:12,576 --> 00:49:13,766
Fire!

472
00:49:18,016 --> 00:49:19,706
Chase them!

473
00:49:21,886 --> 00:49:22,716
Come on!

474
00:49:23,856 --> 00:49:24,846
Come on!

475
00:50:11,636 --> 00:50:14,326
Run in separate ways!
Let's meet up in Rkudaya!

476
00:50:15,436 --> 00:50:17,926
Hurry up! Come on!

477
00:50:35,786 --> 00:50:37,016
Awi, come on!

478
00:50:37,126 --> 00:50:38,186
Here comes the airplane again!

479
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:48,166
Why is Pihu still there?

480
00:50:50,736 --> 00:50:51,506
Come on!

481
00:51:01,746 --> 00:51:03,516
Hurry up, Pihu!

482
00:51:03,616 --> 00:51:05,556
The bridge is collapsing!

483
00:51:13,496 --> 00:51:15,356
Come on, the bridge is collapsing!

484
00:51:26,976 --> 00:51:28,906
Medic! Medic!

485
00:51:29,006 --> 00:51:31,106
Hurry up!

486
00:51:38,916 --> 00:51:40,386
Hurry up!

487
00:51:42,226 --> 00:51:49,496
No matter which route we took
we were ambushed by them

488
00:51:49,596 --> 00:51:51,726
These savages are too good at this

489
00:51:51,836 --> 00:51:54,826
We should ask for more reinforcements,
otherwise..

490
00:51:57,176 --> 00:52:00,666
With thousands of soldiers
and all kinds of powerful weapons

491
00:52:01,706 --> 00:52:06,506
and you ended up being toyed with
by 300 savages?

492
00:52:07,716 --> 00:52:12,776
Our airplanes have been patrolling
and bombing all this time

493
00:52:12,886 --> 00:52:15,656
without killing any savage

494
00:52:16,756 --> 00:52:20,956
And you call yourselves military officers?

495
00:52:33,106 --> 00:52:37,166
Those savages played hit and run

496
00:52:37,276 --> 00:52:39,876
They're like ghosts

497
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:42,606
They ran easily
over the ragged mountain paths

498
00:52:42,716 --> 00:52:44,446
that we barely walked properly on

499
00:52:44,556 --> 00:52:47,646
We never knew where they came from
or where they disappeared to

500
00:52:47,756 --> 00:52:50,016
They were so unpredictable

501
00:52:51,426 --> 00:52:53,396
For example, a kid named Pawan Nawi..

502
00:52:54,466 --> 00:52:59,296
We saw him here the day before yesterday
but we found him here yesterday

503
00:52:59,396 --> 00:53:02,096
Then he was here today

504
00:53:03,306 --> 00:53:06,396
These are three different places
far away from one another

505
00:53:06,506 --> 00:53:11,966
No one knows how he managed to do so

506
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,986
Pawan, have you fought any battle?

507
00:53:23,956 --> 00:53:25,186
Pawan! -Chief Mouna!

508
00:53:29,696 --> 00:53:37,666
Chief Dahdo Nokan from Gungu Clan
was killed in a battle

509
00:53:51,556 --> 00:53:53,816
Has anyone seen Mouna Rudo yet?

510
00:53:59,456 --> 00:54:01,456
Answer me! -No, sir

511
00:54:02,726 --> 00:54:05,226
That old bastard!

512
00:54:05,766 --> 00:54:11,636
He had the guts to revolt
but he dares not confront me personally

513
00:54:11,736 --> 00:54:14,576
What kind of warrior is he?
What kind of chief is he?

514
00:54:17,316 --> 00:54:18,676
Be quiet!

515
00:54:30,996 --> 00:54:37,986
They've got lines and lines of defense
and endless reinforcement

516
00:54:39,706 --> 00:54:47,106
I can't believe those savages
would have battle plans so well-knit

517
00:54:56,416 --> 00:54:59,476
Ask the high command to provide us
with gas bombs

518
00:54:59,586 --> 00:55:02,416
Gas bombs?

519
00:55:06,366 --> 00:55:09,626
I wanted you to be civilized

520
00:55:09,736 --> 00:55:12,756
but you forced me to be savage

521
00:55:19,206 --> 00:55:22,036
You're Mouna Rudo

522
00:55:25,046 --> 00:55:27,446
but I'm Kamada Yahiko

523
00:55:28,816 --> 00:55:31,786
From now on..

524
00:55:31,886 --> 00:55:40,556
you're part of the Japanese
military and police forces

525
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:44,566
You'll have to follow our wartime decrees

526
00:55:44,666 --> 00:55:49,436
Those of you who fight bravely
will be rewarded accordingly

527
00:55:50,276 --> 00:55:52,176
But those of you

528
00:55:52,276 --> 00:55:58,806
who fail to take orders from
the Japanese police or run away

529
00:55:58,916 --> 00:56:03,116
will be punished harshly by law

530
00:56:03,956 --> 00:56:05,316
Do you understand?

531
00:56:07,086 --> 00:56:11,086
Now I'm announcing
the bounties of head-hunting

532
00:56:15,796 --> 00:56:18,736
We'll give every one of you a gun

533
00:56:24,576 --> 00:56:28,666
Come and sign for it after this

534
00:56:36,456 --> 00:56:43,186
A chief.. 150 to 200 dollars

535
00:56:43,326 --> 00:56:46,696
An able-bodied man, 100

536
00:56:49,166 --> 00:56:52,796
A woman, 30

537
00:56:52,896 --> 00:56:55,836
A child, 20

538
00:56:57,536 --> 00:56:59,236
And a special bounty for the head of..

539
00:57:09,186 --> 00:57:10,616
...Mouna Rudo!

540
00:57:27,366 --> 00:57:28,566
Gas bombs?

541
00:57:34,876 --> 00:57:36,366
But sir,

542
00:57:37,376 --> 00:57:40,646
Gas bombs are still being experimented on

543
00:57:40,746 --> 00:57:42,716
We don't know the effects yet

544
00:57:43,386 --> 00:57:44,476
Yes, sir

545
00:57:45,686 --> 00:57:47,206
Yes, sir

546
00:57:47,786 --> 00:57:50,626
But currently it's not ready for use

547
00:57:50,726 --> 00:57:52,656
Yes, sir

548
00:57:52,756 --> 00:57:53,416
Yes, sir

549
00:58:52,616 --> 00:58:54,286
Come on!

550
00:58:56,486 --> 00:58:57,886
Watan, you go that way!

551
00:59:11,176 --> 00:59:11,936
Sapu!

552
00:59:13,346 --> 00:59:15,246
I'm alright. They hit my sweet potatoes

553
00:59:24,886 --> 00:59:26,946
Don't stop! Run!

554
00:59:31,496 --> 00:59:33,756
Shoot! Shoot him!

555
00:59:33,866 --> 00:59:35,196
Come on!

556
00:59:42,836 --> 00:59:44,166
Out of the way!

557
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:16,636
Over there!

558
01:00:39,396 --> 01:00:41,126
A Seediq from Tgdaya! -Where?

559
01:00:41,226 --> 01:00:42,286
He's over there!

560
01:00:42,926 --> 01:00:43,916
Kill him!

561
01:01:47,166 --> 01:01:48,856
Burn it down!

562
01:02:43,786 --> 01:02:44,806
Temu!

563
01:03:15,046 --> 01:03:16,606
Come on! Run!

564
01:05:53,846 --> 01:05:56,406
Chief Mouna! It's me, Pawan

565
01:05:59,516 --> 01:06:02,776
Chief Mouna! It's me, Pawan Nawi

566
01:06:21,736 --> 01:06:25,766
Chief Mouna, we heard what Baso told you

567
01:06:25,876 --> 01:06:30,106
We know that a large number of
Japanese soldiers have gathered in Suku Clan

568
01:06:30,206 --> 01:06:32,906
Time for the decisive battle, isn't it?

569
01:06:39,716 --> 01:06:45,056
Chief Mouna, we have no family now
Why don't you let us fight?

570
01:06:45,156 --> 01:06:50,326
Like everyone else, none of us can sleep or eat

571
01:06:50,436 --> 01:06:54,426
and we don't want to be killed by gas bombs

572
01:07:00,746 --> 01:07:05,706
Chief Mouna, look at the tattoos on our faces
We're not children anymore

573
01:07:05,816 --> 01:07:09,746
Please let us fight the Japanese
like everybody else

574
01:07:13,116 --> 01:07:15,516
Then I can have a good, long rest

575
01:07:16,686 --> 01:07:20,146
We're so tired

576
01:07:20,256 --> 01:07:23,196
We're really exhausted

577
01:07:44,316 --> 01:07:48,256
My children, do you remember
where our ancestors came from?

578
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:50,016
Mt. White Stone.. -I know. Once upon a time...
-Let me tell the story!

579
01:07:50,126 --> 01:07:51,356
Quiet!

580
01:07:53,026 --> 01:07:54,396
Can't you wait?

581
01:07:56,366 --> 01:08:00,166
A good hunter should learn how to lie in wait!

582
01:08:02,306 --> 01:08:03,796
Pawan, you tell the story

583
01:08:12,216 --> 01:08:19,486
Once upon a time on Mt. White Stone
there was a big tree called Pusu Qhuni

584
01:08:19,586 --> 01:08:25,316
The tree trunk was half wood, half stone

585
01:08:25,426 --> 01:08:32,626
One day, a boy and a girl were born
from the tree trunk

586
01:08:32,736 --> 01:08:35,636
Then the couple gave birth to lots of children

587
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:39,696
and here we are, the Seediq Bale

588
01:09:07,636 --> 01:09:10,066
Let me help you, Awi

589
01:09:13,606 --> 01:09:15,876
It's ready, my brother

590
01:09:40,396 --> 01:09:41,456
I'm ready

591
01:09:47,206 --> 01:09:50,146
Let go, my brother

592
01:09:50,246 --> 01:09:51,936
Pihu Walis..

593
01:09:52,876 --> 01:09:54,216
Don't go! -Let go!

594
01:09:54,886 --> 01:09:56,816
I'm in great pain

595
01:09:56,916 --> 01:09:58,576
Don't go

596
01:10:27,516 --> 01:10:30,676
I'm not fighting anymore! No more!

597
01:10:30,786 --> 01:10:32,216
No more!

598
01:10:32,316 --> 01:10:33,306
You son of a bitch!

599
01:10:34,686 --> 01:10:37,386
What do you mean by not fighting?
-Kojima!

600
01:10:37,496 --> 01:10:39,656
What do you mean by that? -Kojima!

601
01:10:39,756 --> 01:10:41,886
Pick it up! Pick up your gun!

602
01:10:41,996 --> 01:10:43,516
Out of my way! -Temu!

603
01:10:44,066 --> 01:10:44,966
Temu!

604
01:10:48,866 --> 01:10:52,826
We fight to offer blood sacrifice to our ancestors

605
01:10:53,576 --> 01:10:56,976
not to revenge the death of your family

606
01:11:15,726 --> 01:11:20,166
Temu, I know what you saw

607
01:11:20,266 --> 01:11:24,466
but Mouna Rudo has spread the word
asking for your head

608
01:11:24,576 --> 01:11:27,596
This is not the time to make trouble

609
01:11:46,296 --> 01:11:51,496
Father, you told me only the bravest warriors

610
01:11:51,596 --> 01:11:55,936
are qualified to guard
the most beautiful hunting ground

611
01:11:56,036 --> 01:12:00,666
So that's why Mouna Rudo's people and we
have to fight one another constantly

612
01:12:00,776 --> 01:12:06,406
to prove to our ancestors
that we're the bravest warriors?

613
01:12:12,416 --> 01:12:14,976
So in the eternal hunting ground
at the other end of the rainbow

614
01:12:15,086 --> 01:12:21,156
we'll become allies forever
and there would be no more hatred?

615
01:12:23,466 --> 01:12:24,756
Yeah, I guess so

616
01:12:25,696 --> 01:12:31,536
I want to fight them if possible
to prove my bravery

617
01:12:33,536 --> 01:12:34,806
Sleep, my boy

618
01:14:02,966 --> 01:14:04,726
Is that our man?

619
01:14:08,306 --> 01:14:15,336
Get him! He's a savage! Come on!

620
01:14:16,276 --> 01:14:17,866
Stop!

621
01:14:19,346 --> 01:14:20,476
Stop!

622
01:14:21,086 --> 01:14:21,946
What's wrong?

623
01:14:22,046 --> 01:14:24,416
A savage ran over the suspension bridge
into the woods

624
01:14:27,686 --> 01:14:29,386
From there? -Yes, from there

625
01:14:31,396 --> 01:14:32,446
Gather up!

626
01:14:32,556 --> 01:14:34,156
Gather up, First Team!

627
01:14:34,266 --> 01:14:35,486
Gather up!

628
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:36,926
First Team!

629
01:14:41,806 --> 01:14:43,096
Stop!

630
01:14:50,546 --> 01:14:52,136
Good

631
01:14:52,246 --> 01:14:54,006
Come closer..

632
01:14:54,116 --> 01:14:55,806
Good

633
01:14:55,916 --> 01:14:57,786
Stop, you little bastard

634
01:15:15,606 --> 01:15:17,156
Aoki!

635
01:15:17,266 --> 01:15:18,996
Okubo! -Aoki!

636
01:15:19,106 --> 01:15:21,236
Where are you? -Aoki!

637
01:15:21,346 --> 01:15:23,906
Okubo! -Aoki!

638
01:15:24,006 --> 01:15:29,206
Aoki! Okubo!

639
01:15:30,956 --> 01:15:32,716
Let's split up and search!

640
01:15:35,686 --> 01:15:37,126
Aoki!

641
01:15:37,826 --> 01:15:40,846
Okubo! Aoki!

642
01:15:40,966 --> 01:15:42,256
Stop!

643
01:15:42,626 --> 01:15:43,756
Everybody, stop!

644
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:25,336
These Seediqs from Tgdaya
are driven crazy by hunger

645
01:16:28,676 --> 01:16:30,036
Okubo!

646
01:16:31,676 --> 01:16:32,666
Where are you?

647
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:37,916
Aoki!

648
01:16:40,486 --> 01:16:42,146
Where are you?

649
01:16:42,256 --> 01:16:43,386
Okubo!

650
01:16:45,956 --> 01:16:47,256
Okubo!

651
01:16:48,326 --> 01:16:49,156
Someone's there!

652
01:16:49,266 --> 01:16:51,056
Where? -In that tree!

653
01:16:51,736 --> 01:16:52,526
Get down!

654
01:16:54,406 --> 01:16:57,526
Get down! -Hide!

655
01:17:07,846 --> 01:17:09,106
Machineguns?

656
01:17:09,216 --> 01:17:11,146
Get the mortars!

657
01:17:11,256 --> 01:17:13,716
Signalman! Signalman!

658
01:17:38,716 --> 01:17:41,116
Here come the savages!

659
01:17:41,216 --> 01:17:44,236
Here come the savages!

660
01:17:46,616 --> 01:17:48,086
Here come the savages!

661
01:19:03,596 --> 01:19:04,686
It's you then

662
01:19:07,396 --> 01:19:09,696
Chief, Baso is hit!

663
01:19:09,836 --> 01:19:12,136
Baso! Baso!

664
01:19:12,236 --> 01:19:14,206
Baso!

665
01:19:21,446 --> 01:19:24,246
We're in the Mehebu Forest

666
01:19:26,016 --> 01:19:27,786
Baso! Baso!

667
01:19:27,886 --> 01:19:30,826
Baso, are you alright?

668
01:19:30,926 --> 01:19:32,396
Baso, be still!

669
01:19:32,496 --> 01:19:33,486
Retreat!

670
01:19:34,726 --> 01:19:36,256
Come on, retreat!
