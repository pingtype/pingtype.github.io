1
00:00:08,245 --> 00:00:11,043
Ah-shue, where are your parents?

2
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:14,244
They left this morning.

3
00:00:15,686 --> 00:00:20,680
Dad usually comes home late, drunk.

4
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:23,792
He staggers and vomits all over the house.

5
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:30,226
When did your father's club close?

6
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:31,629
In March.

7
00:00:31,735 --> 00:00:34,033
It was chaotic for a while.

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,930
Many people died,

9
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,240
...and the neighborhood was wrecked.

10
00:00:40,945 --> 00:00:44,642
Dad's friend, Mr. Ko, was arrested.

11
00:00:44,748 --> 00:00:45,680
Ah-shue!

12
00:01:25,656 --> 00:01:27,886
Aunt Hinomi, uncle has returned.

13
00:01:31,362 --> 00:01:33,626
We waited a long time, but he knew...

14
00:01:33,964 --> 00:01:36,057
...which station exit to take.

15
00:01:59,456 --> 00:02:00,252
Ah-shue,

16
00:02:00,491 --> 00:02:01,924
...look for your brothers.

17
00:02:07,798 --> 00:02:09,231
Take your time and write.

18
00:02:14,705 --> 00:02:17,469
Uncle, you cannot eat that.

19
00:02:18,943 --> 00:02:20,604
It's food for the altar.

20
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:26,443
You can't eat it.

21
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:52,544
<i>You are thinner.
Are you OK?</i>

22
00:02:52,545 --> 00:02:56,545
<i>My brother disappeared.
He was hiding in Lai-liao.</i>

23
00:02:56,546 --> 00:03:01,546
<i>One day soldiers came.
Since then, we have had no news.</i>

24
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:30,238
Wen-ching!

25
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,638
Wen-ching!

26
00:06:00,898 --> 00:06:02,263
Here comes Mr. Huang.

27
00:06:05,335 --> 00:06:09,271
Mr. Huang, this is
my good friend Wen-ching.

28
00:06:14,111 --> 00:06:16,170
He was in prison with your brother...

29
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,613
... before he was executed.

30
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:22,178
He has come especially to see you.

31
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:25,100
Sit down.

32
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:01,801
<i>"In life, far from the motherland.

33
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:04,802
<i>"In death, returning to the motherland.

34
00:07:04,803 --> 00:07:08,803
<i>"Both life and death
are governed by destiny."</i>

35
00:08:05,004 --> 00:08:07,804
<i>Hinoe got married and
lives in the mountains.</i>

36
00:08:07,805 --> 00:08:11,805
<i>I can't tell you where.
She doesn't want her family to know.</i>

37
00:08:11,806 --> 00:08:15,806
<i>She said, "Consider me dead.
My life belongs to the motherland.</i>

38
00:08:15,807 --> 00:08:19,807
<i>"In prison, I swore to live, for the sake of 
friends who had died."</i>

39
00:09:26,808 --> 00:09:31,808
<i>I cannot live like before.
I want to stay here.</i>

40
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:36,809
<i>I know I can do whatever you ask me.

41
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,010
<i>This is no place for you.</i>

42
00:09:57,211 --> 00:10:04,211
<i>What's important are your beliefs,
not where you live or what you do.</i>

43
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:11,812
<i>They suggested marriage to Hinomi,
but it's you she loves.</i>

44
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:05,295
Let me introduce my best friend, 
Wen-ching.

45
00:13:07,924 --> 00:13:09,448
Are you going to reopen for business or not?

46
00:13:11,595 --> 00:13:12,584
Enough!

47
00:13:12,796 --> 00:13:14,457
Go and play outside

48
00:13:14,564 --> 00:13:16,725
Wen-leung, this is for the altar.

49
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,529
Eat after the prayers.

50
00:13:21,171 --> 00:13:24,800
You decided to close.

51
00:13:24,908 --> 00:13:27,274
Now you won't say
when you'll reopen.

52
00:13:27,377 --> 00:13:28,639
Can't you make up your mind?

53
00:13:30,413 --> 00:13:31,345
Shut up!

54
00:13:31,681 --> 00:13:32,978
Don't argue with me!

55
00:13:38,421 --> 00:13:40,048
Don't drink from the teapot!

56
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,780
You're setting a bad example to the children!

57
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:44,387
You're too big for such things.

58
00:13:50,634 --> 00:13:51,965
Are you thirsty?

59
00:13:55,939 --> 00:13:59,102
Drink properly or not at all.
Don't be ridiculous.

60
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:07,142
Look!

61
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,419
You were gone for days,
God knows where!

62
00:14:10,787 --> 00:14:14,086
You either lock yourself in your room
or hide out where...

63
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,680
...nobody can find you.

64
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:20,323
I wanted you to visit mother's grave
with me. Where were you?

65
00:14:21,464 --> 00:14:23,329
That's why I have such bad luck!

66
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:27,000
I am the only one of the four children...

67
00:14:27,103 --> 00:14:30,197
...who visits mum's grave.
She asks me why,

68
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:34,069
...and I don't lack for words.
As for you,

69
00:14:34,477 --> 00:14:36,707
...how long do you think you can go
without working?

70
00:14:38,815 --> 00:14:43,912
I planned to open a photographic studio
on the side so you could run it.

71
00:14:44,654 --> 00:14:46,121
We discussed it enough.

72
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,691
When will you give me an answer?

73
00:14:49,826 --> 00:14:52,351
How can he reply? He can't hear.

74
00:14:52,495 --> 00:14:54,053
Shut up!

75
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:57,796
The only thing you know
is to tell people off.

76
00:14:59,903 --> 00:15:02,303
Ah-shue, you tell him.

77
00:15:08,044 --> 00:15:10,535
When a young woman visits us,

78
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:13,013
...without thinking of her dignity,

79
00:15:13,116 --> 00:15:16,677
...it's obvious what's going on.
Don't you understand?

80
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:19,985
What are you waiting for?

81
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:42,505
What's all the row?
Stop singing!

82
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,750
Damn it!

83
00:15:52,422 --> 00:15:53,650
Shut up!

84
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:58,190
What's all this howling?

85
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:04,791
You are like bad spirits.
What's all the noise?

86
00:16:05,435 --> 00:16:07,630
Why are you shouting?

87
00:16:09,272 --> 00:16:13,208
Can't you talk normally?

88
00:16:16,646 --> 00:16:17,806
What's going on?

89
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:27,017
It's useless. He seems incapable
of acting normally.

90
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:30,590
I'm sorry.

91
00:16:31,561 --> 00:16:32,960
Please, carry on singing.

92
00:16:35,231 --> 00:16:36,357
No, thank you.

93
00:16:38,234 --> 00:16:39,997
Take no notice of him.

94
00:16:40,103 --> 00:16:43,630
You sing very well.

95
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,950
Please, carry on.

96
00:16:45,975 --> 00:16:47,442
He's as stubborn as a mule!

97
00:16:47,544 --> 00:16:50,377
People like him
can't be taught anything.

98
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,010
Damn you!

99
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:52,366
How come you're not dead?

100
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:55,263
You really made Wen-leung
suffer.

101
00:18:55,371 --> 00:18:56,838
Shame on you!

102
00:19:02,078 --> 00:19:03,602
So?

103
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:07,479
What's up?

104
00:19:07,584 --> 00:19:09,347
What's up?

105
00:19:09,852 --> 00:19:12,878
You know what you did.

106
00:19:13,423 --> 00:19:17,553
Shut up or you'll be sorry.

107
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,025
What will you do about it?

108
00:19:20,563 --> 00:19:21,427
What?

109
00:19:21,598 --> 00:19:22,792
Calm down.

110
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:24,127
You don't scare me.

111
00:19:26,302 --> 00:19:27,496
Pig!

112
00:19:27,604 --> 00:19:29,435
You'll come to a bad end
one of these days.

113
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:40,567
Older brother!
Older brother!

114
00:20:44,113 --> 00:20:47,446
Ah-ga.

115
00:20:48,584 --> 00:20:49,414
Call a doctor!

116
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,679
What happened?

117
00:21:02,532 --> 00:21:04,727
Kim-tsua, take that knife.

118
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:06,729
Call a doctor.

119
00:21:31,327 --> 00:21:32,259
Wen-heung!

120
00:24:09,085 --> 00:24:10,347
Here comes the bride.

121
00:24:13,122 --> 00:24:17,320
Let's ask our ancestors...

122
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:27,700
...for children and wealth.

123
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,851
Bow to the ancestors.

124
00:24:59,936 --> 00:25:00,960
Kneel down.

125
00:25:05,808 --> 00:25:06,900
Pray.

126
00:25:08,911 --> 00:25:10,208
First reverence.

127
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:15,073
Two.

128
00:25:17,253 --> 00:25:18,550
Three.

129
00:25:21,157 --> 00:25:22,249
Pray.

130
00:25:24,226 --> 00:25:25,557
Four.

131
00:25:28,531 --> 00:25:29,691
Five.

132
00:25:32,535 --> 00:25:33,763
Six.

133
00:25:36,172 --> 00:25:37,366
Pray.

134
00:25:39,108 --> 00:25:40,439
Seven.

135
00:25:43,379 --> 00:25:44,676
Eight.

136
00:25:47,216 --> 00:25:48,706
Nine.

137
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:52,320
Stand up.

138
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:57,854
Bow to each other.

139
00:26:02,264 --> 00:26:03,526
Kneel.

140
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,340
Bride and groom, bow
to each other three times.

141
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,950
One.

142
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,080
Two.

143
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,100
Three.

144
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,650
Stand up.

145
00:30:15,851 --> 00:30:17,216
<i>It's late.</i>

146
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,918
<i>I heard the first thunder
of spring.</i>

147
00:30:20,322 --> 00:30:24,053
<i>One clap after another,</i>

148
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,196
<i>...as if waking the hillsides
and the sea.</i>

149
00:30:31,734 --> 00:30:34,362
<i>Someone came from the mountains.</i>

150
00:30:34,803 --> 00:30:37,203
<i>He said my brother
needed money.</i>

151
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:39,498
<i>He needed it...</i>

152
00:30:39,608 --> 00:30:42,577
<i>...to print pamphlets
to educate people.</i>

153
00:30:43,045 --> 00:30:46,947
<i>The man said they didn't want
to be always asking...</i>

154
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:50,876
<i>...for help from Weng-ching.</i>

155
00:30:51,353 --> 00:30:53,321
<i>But only when they come
to ask for money,</i>

156
00:30:53,656 --> 00:30:56,591
<i>...do we know that they're safe
and that the struggle continues.</i>

157
00:30:56,992 --> 00:31:00,723
<i>Only then are we satisfied.</i>

158
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:05,997
<i>Ah-chien can already make sounds.</i>

159
00:31:06,101 --> 00:31:08,535
<i>Last night I thought
he was saying "mummy."</i>

160
00:31:09,338 --> 00:31:13,035
<i>I was so happy.</i>

161
00:31:13,142 --> 00:31:15,406
<i>I hurried to find Wen-ching...</i>

162
00:31:15,811 --> 00:31:17,540
<i>...so he could hear too.</i>

163
00:31:17,746 --> 00:31:21,546
<i>It was only when I saw him I realized
my stupidity. How could he hear?</i>

164
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:42,364
<i>Prices are rising.</i>

165
00:31:42,805 --> 00:31:45,899
<i>The neighbors say
times will be hard.</i>

166
00:31:46,275 --> 00:31:48,140
<i>Maybe I'm a fool.</i>

167
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:52,574
<i>But while I have Wen-ching
and Ah-chien...</i>

168
00:31:52,748 --> 00:31:55,512
<i>...I think I'll be happy.</i>

169
00:35:34,636 --> 00:35:36,433
Don't run!

170
00:35:40,876 --> 00:35:42,865
Still running! Shit!

171
00:35:46,682 --> 00:35:47,808
Why are you shouting?

172
00:36:02,898 --> 00:36:03,990
On your knees.

173
00:36:07,336 --> 00:36:08,667
Heads down.

174
00:36:15,777 --> 00:36:16,971
What are you looking at?

175
00:39:19,194 --> 00:39:22,823
<i>Ah-shue, your uncle Wen-ching
has been arrested.</i>

176
00:39:23,198 --> 00:39:26,759
<i>We still don't know where he is.</i>

177
00:39:27,803 --> 00:39:29,794
<i>At first we considered running away,</i>

178
00:39:30,138 --> 00:39:32,868
<i>...but there was nowhere to go</i>

179
00:39:36,111 --> 00:39:38,204
<i>I am writing this long after,</i>

180
00:39:38,413 --> 00:39:41,849
<i>...because only now do I feel
calmer.</i>

181
00:39:43,185 --> 00:39:47,349
<i>This photo was taken three days
before Wen-ching's arrest.</i>

182
00:39:48,523 --> 00:39:49,956
<i>When they came for him,</i>

183
00:39:50,158 --> 00:39:52,490
<i>...he was taking someone's portrait.</i>

184
00:39:52,994 --> 00:39:55,189
<i>He insisted on finishing the job...</i>

185
00:39:55,597 --> 00:39:57,758
<i>...before they took him away.</i>

186
00:40:01,069 --> 00:40:05,768
<i>I searched and asked all over
Taipei but have no news.</i>

187
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:09,277
<i>Ah-chien has his first teeth.</i>

188
00:40:09,744 --> 00:40:11,405
<i>He has a lovely smile...</i>

189
00:40:11,513 --> 00:40:13,413
<i>and your uncle's eyes.</i>

190
00:40:14,516 --> 00:40:16,507
<i>Please, come and see us soon.</i>

191
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:19,282
<i>It's fresh in Chiu-fen.</i>

192
00:40:19,754 --> 00:40:21,381
<i>The autumn flowers
are in bloom.</i>

193
00:40:21,756 --> 00:40:24,623
<i>The mountains are all white,
like snow.</i>

194
00:40:31,132 --> 00:40:32,156
It's time to eat.

195
00:40:32,267 --> 00:40:33,996
OK. Just a moment.

196
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:35,500
Ah-chi,

197
00:40:36,004 --> 00:40:37,437
...you shouldn't be watching
adults gambling.

198
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:38,833
Bring your uncle.

199
00:40:39,474 --> 00:40:41,066
Uncle, it's time to eat.

200
00:40:52,387 --> 00:40:53,411
Where is Uncle Wan?

201
00:40:53,522 --> 00:40:55,422
He said he'd be back soon.

202
00:40:55,524 --> 00:40:56,616
Wash your hands.

203
00:41:30,717 --> 00:41:31,717
Help yourselves.

204
00:43:14,618 --> 00:43:20,318
December 1949.
Mainland China is lost.

205
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:25,319
The Nationalist government
moves to Taiwan.

206
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:31,320
Taipei becomes
provisional capital.

207
