1
00:00:09,248 --> 00:00:15,248
<i> After pondering the situation in the world
and in our empire,</i>

2
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:21,049
<i>...we have decided to resort to
an extraordinary measure.</i>

3
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:26,050
<i>Loyal subjects, we have ordered
our government...</i>

4
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:30,051
<i>...to communicate to
 the USA, Great Britain,</i>

5
00:00:30,052 --> 00:00:33,052
<i>...China and the USSR,</i>

6
00:00:33,053 --> 00:00:37,053
<i>...our acceptance of
the provisions...</i>

7
00:00:37,054 --> 00:00:40,054
<i>...of their Joint Declaration.</i>

8
00:00:42,055 --> 00:00:47,055
<i>To strive for the security and
well-being of our subjects...</i>

9
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:51,056
<i>...and for the prosperity and happiness
of all nations, is a....</i>

10
00:00:51,057 --> 00:00:57,557
<i>...solemn obligation handed down by
our imperial ancestors.</i>

11
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,558
<i>We declared war on
the USA and Britain...</i>

12
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,559
<i>...out of a desire to ensure
the self-preservation of Japan...</i>

13
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,560
<i>...and the stability of
East Asia.</i>

14
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:12,561
<i>To violate the sovereignty of others...</i>

15
00:01:12,562 --> 00:01:15,562
<i>...or to embark on
territorial aggrandizement,</i>

16
00:01:15,563 --> 00:01:19,563
<i>...was far from our
thoughts.</i>

17
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,607
Relax.

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,411
Gently. Or it will be
more difficult.

19
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,682
Open your mouth when I tell you.

20
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:35,693
Keep it closed now.

21
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,556
You are doing fine, just fine.

22
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,158
The pain is coming back?

23
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,834
Close your mouth.

24
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,303
Do you feel the need
for a bowel movement?

25
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:51,271
Do you?

26
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:56,278
Is that what it feels like?
Well, squeeze tightly then.

27
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:07,390
Prepare the water!

28
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,039
Hurry!

29
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,731
The light has come on again. At last.

30
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:31,233
It's a boy...
Congratulations.

31
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:41,234
<i>On August 15 1945. Japan announced
its unconditional surrender.</i>

32
00:03:41,235 --> 00:03:46,235
<i>Taiwan was liberated following
51 years of Japanese occupation.</i>

33
00:03:46,236 --> 00:03:51,136
<i>The wife of older brother,
Lin Wen-heung, gave birth to a son.</i>

34
00:03:51,237 --> 00:03:55,237
<i>They named him Kang-ming,
which means Light.</i>

CITY OF SADNESS
Directed by Hou Hsiao-hsien

36
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:34,732
Going already?
Sorry for the mess.

37
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,041
We didn't give you a proper welcome.

38
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,072
Come again.

39
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:45,715
- Ah, hello.
- A small gift for you.

40
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,613
Go and play over there.

41
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:53,683
Behave or grandfather will
take a stick to you.

42
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,890
Yes, it's me.

43
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,124
Thank you, thank you.

44
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,829
I don't want to inconvenience you.

45
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,698
I am sorry to trouble you.

46
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,897
Thanks.

47
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,539
Until this evening then.

48
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:15,403
I'll be waiting for you.

49
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:23,520
Wen-heung,

50
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:28,385
...did you tell your brother
you were coming?

51
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,553
I wrote to Wen-ching.

52
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:34,195
He is too busy to come.

53
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,631
He can't come?

54
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:39,929
So who will take
the photos?

55
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:44,973
Don't worry, father.
I've arranged everything.

56
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,807
Who did you ask?

57
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:50,849
A photographer friend
of old Gao-kun.

58
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,510
He's a top-notch photographer.

59
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,083
The best in the district.

60
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,780
Not as good as Wen-ching.

61
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,457
Mr. Xu is here.
Show him in.

62
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:22,011
To business and to our
future prosperity.

63
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,208
To prosperity!

Don't move.

67
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,700
Smile, please.

68
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,150
Ready?

69
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,500
Thanks!

70
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:10,992
<i>20 years and 11 months of

72
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,494
<i>I took the letter of recommendation
from my father...</i>

<i>...to look for work at the
Kimguishiu Miners Hospital.</i>

<i>My brother was giving classes and...</i>

75
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,612
<i>...sent his friend Wen-ching
to pick me up.</i>

76
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,747
<i>It was cool in the mountains...</i>

77
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,714
<i>...and the view was lovely.</i>

78

<i>I feel so happy.</i>

80
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,690
A photograph.

81
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,256
Beautiful.

82

<i>Photographs of two of my older
brothers before the war.</i>

<i>They have still not returned. Someone in
Shanghai saw my third brother.</i>

84
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:00,559
<i>But we have had no news of the second,
who was sent to the Philippines.</i>

85
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,395
This is the studio of Wen-ching.

86
00:10:35,396 --> 00:10:37,396
Hinoe says that this is the
studio of Wen-ching.

87
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,463
Why isn't he here?

88
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:46,808
Where is Wen-ching?

89
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,880
At the back, taking photos.

90
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,011
Come in, please.

91
00:11:32,012 --> 00:11:34,012
- After you.
- No, after you.

92
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:39,625
Are all these books yours?

93
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,757
Mine and Wen-ching's.

94
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,460
We are real
book worms.

95
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,266
Are you reading Marx?

96
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,732
Very progressive, eh?

97
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,504
They are all interesting, and so
we are studying them.

98
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:05,551
Mr. Lin, do you remember Wen-ching?

99
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,026
The deaf man.

100
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:10,526
Wen-ching.

101
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,720
Let me introduce...

102
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,831
...Mr. Lin.

103
00:12:15,032 --> 00:12:15,832
Pleased to meet you.

104
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:17,661
My mentor.

105
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,534
We've heard a lot about you.

106
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,775
It's a pleasure.

107
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,705
Mr. Ho, a journalist.

108
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:32,706
From the mainland.

109
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:42,093
Please sit down.

110
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,093
Are you familiar with China?

111
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,430
There's a lot for me to learn.

112
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,473
China is in a mess
at present.

113
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,573
Ever since Chen Yi became
governor of Taiwan,

114
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:04,038
...things have changed.
He thinks differently from the Japanese.

115
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:05,539
In what way?

116
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,540
He manages things differently
from the Japanese.

117
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:14,241
<i>Our Japanese director had an
attack this morning...</i>

118
00:13:14,242 --> 00:13:18,242
<i>...but he insisted on going out
after he'd had an injection.</i>

119
00:13:18,243 --> 00:13:21,243
<i>His daughter Shizuko is very sad.</i>

120
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,900
During the past 3 days,
dad has been...

121
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:42,400
...threatening to go to the south of Taiwan.
He said that Mr. Chen would take him.

122
00:13:43,835 --> 00:13:47,950
But he died years ago.

123
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,950
Dad was at his funeral.

124
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,750
The other day, the Japanese
Repatriation Office told us...

125
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,620
...that a boat would be coming to
Keelung to pick us up.

126
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:10,100
They told us not to go
too far away.

127
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:17,650
But this morning dad packed
his bags and left.

128
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,780
We are all very worried.

129
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,492
A pain... in the head.

130
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,792
A pain... in the head.

131
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,136
A pain... in the stomach.

132
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,937
A pain... in the stomach.

133
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,077
Where does it hurt?

134
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,713
Don't worry.

135
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,215
I don't think it's serious.

136
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,222
Thank goodness he came back.

137
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,887
He can recover here.

138
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,931
Perhaps my mother's grave is
in an unlucky location.

139
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:20,606
She died leaving four children.

140
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:25,278
My younger brother
disappeared in the Philippines.

141
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,782
The youngest is deaf.

142
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,111
The third came back from the war but
is mad.

143
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,325
Wen-leung, what are you doing?

144
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,472
Wen-leung, quiet!

145
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,546
Let me be!

146
00:17:04,014 --> 00:17:05,014
Wen-leung, you're mad!

147
00:17:14,014 --> 00:17:15,014
Wen-leung, calm down!

148
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,704
Wen-leung, calm down!

149
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,606
Wen-leung, calm down!

150
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,014
Quiet! Quiet!

151
00:17:56,014 --> 00:17:59,014
It's OK.

152
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,263
He'll be fine now.

153
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,534
<i>When Taiwan was returned
to China,</i>

154
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,508
<i>...they told us we'd change flags.</i>

155
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,375
The Japanese flag is white
with a red circle in the middle.

156
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:12,450
You can hang it in a way that's...

157
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:16,214
...different from the Chinese flag.

158
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,188
The people held discussions. Should the sun
be on the top or the bottom?

159
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,350
But the mayor was adamant.
It had to be on the bottom.

160
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,461
At daybreak, the sky is red and so
the sun had to be at the bottom.

161
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,524
Everyone had to have it
as he said.

162
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,725
But he sent someone to check.

163
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,861
The first people he checked had
hung it correctly,

164
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:36,498
...but not in the mountains.

165
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,040
Most people put the sun
on the bottom.

166
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,000
And so the mayor felt
vindicated.

167
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,050
But during the day,
a man arrived from the city...

168
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,048
...and said he was wrong,

169
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:49,609
...and that they'd shoot him for it.

170
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,849
The mayor landed and gave new orders,

171
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,425
...but it was already sunset.

172
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,222
The sky was completely red.

173
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,421
It's extraordinary. Suddenly Japanese flags...

174
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,659
...were no use any more.

175
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,928
Only as underpants for children.

176
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,335
They all have red bums.

177
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,837
Like monkeys.

178
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,739
Wu too has one.

179
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,150
Mind what you say.

180
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,541
This man
is a reporter from the mainland.

181
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:18,750
Can your wife do something
with my flag?

182
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,256
I'll write that all the teachers...

183
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:24,478
...in Taiwan have red backsides.

184
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,820
Let's stop talking
and drink.

185
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,757
Cheers.

186
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,000
Let's change the subject.

187
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:35,792
Now that the war is over,
how are things in Taiwan?

188
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,461
Everything's fine.

189
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,768
We are under the Chinese flag 
once more.

190
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:44,938
Reunited with the motherland.

191
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:48,501
It's a good feeling.

192
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,940
But to tell the truth,

193
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,409
...Governor Chen Yi
is a bandit...

194
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,152
...and I don't trust
the Nationalist government.

195
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,747
Enough politics!
Let's drink!

196
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,726
Let's drink.

197
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,500
Raise your glasses.

198
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,278
They are singing
"The Song of the Exiles".

199
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,375
Yes, that's right.

200
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:05,149
We mainlanders
have heard it on the radio.

201
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:08,151
Let's join in.

202
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,784
Yes, let's.

203
00:22:10,385 --> 00:22:12,285
September 18...

204
00:22:13,186 --> 00:22:15,286
September 18...

205
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:21,031
Ever since that tragic day...

206
00:22:24,232 --> 00:22:26,132
September 18...

207
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:29,533
September 18...

208
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:35,009
Ever since that tragic day...

209
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:42,216
...I have been far from my home.

210
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:49,765
I abandoned a wealth of treasure...

211
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:54,569
...and began my wanderings...

212
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,431
...began my wanderings.

213
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:04,077
Far from home...

214
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,483
...I began my wanderings...

215
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,650
...began my wanderings.

216
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:15,251
In what year...

217
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,022
...or in what month...

218
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:29,670
...will I commence my return
to my beloved home?

219
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,210
In what year...

220
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:36,573
...or in what month...

221
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:48,192
...will I commence my return
to my beloved home?

222
00:25:21,464 --> 00:25:22,814
Good day, Miss Shizuko.

223
00:25:22,914 --> 00:25:24,014
Good day.

224
00:25:24,914 --> 00:25:26,164
Is Hinomi here?

225
00:25:26,314 --> 00:25:28,080
She's on duty.

226
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,854
I'm sorry.

227
00:25:31,014 --> 00:25:36,114
- Hello, can I help you?
- I'd like to speak to Hinomi.

228
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,630
She's in the surgery.

229
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,035
Maybe she's finished.

230
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,536
Shall I find out for you?

231
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,550
Wait a moment, please.

232
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:03,400
This sword was the most precious
possession of my dead brother.

233
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,600
It's no use to him now.

234
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,850
Please, give it to Hinoe.

235
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,900
I know my brother
will treasure it.

236
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,600
This is a poem my brother wrote.

237
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:31,300
Hinoe was there
when he wrote it.

238
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:37,050
Please give it to him with the sword
as a memento.

239
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,370
Thank you.

240
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,600
This is for you, Hinomi.

241
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,100
For me?

242
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,150
A kimono?

243
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,800
It's lovely,

244
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:12,800
...but I can't accept it.

245
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,300
It's your most precious possession.

246
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,750
Please accept it.

247
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,050
When I am back in Japan,

248
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,070
...you'll think of you whenever you use it.

249
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,870
Shizuko...

250
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:38,400
Hinoe has been so nice
to us all these years.

251
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,400
We must never forget
each other.

252
00:28:02,901 --> 00:28:11,801
<i>The dragonfly, red in
the sunset.</i>

253
00:28:12,702 --> 00:28:21,802
Did I see you the other day?

254
00:28:23,003 --> 00:28:32,603
When I was picking
mulberries in the fields,

255
00:28:34,604 --> 00:28:43,404
...did I see you or was
it only a dream?

256
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,500
I'll always remember you.

257
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,550
The flowers are blown hither
and thither.

258
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,750
I'll soon follow them.

259
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,950
The same will come to pass for us all.

260
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:01,889
The Japanese love the sight
of cherry trees.

261
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,827
First, in bloom...

262
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,397
...and then, when the flowers fall
to earth.

263
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:15,042
They believe life
too is like that.

264
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,150
In the Meiji Era...

265
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,700
...a woman killed herself
by flinging herself into a waterfall.

266
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,581
<i>In the Meiji Era...</i>

267
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,479
<i>...a woman killed herself
by flinging herself into a waterfall.</i>

268
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:30,827
<i>She wasn't tired of life. She hadn't
lost the will to live.</i>

269
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:34,221
<i>She just couldn't face the loss
of her youth.</i>

270
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:38,400
<i>Once lost, nothing
means anything.</i>

271
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,562
<i>Why not imitate
the cherry blossom...</i>

272
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,135
<i>...and fall when in the fullness
of our beauty?</i>

273
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,470
<i>Carried by the wind.</i>

274
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:49,174
<i>The note she left
was an inspiration...</i>

275
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:53,516
<i>...to all young people...</i>

276
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:57,788
<i>...during the Meiji Era.</i>

277
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:01,091
<i>A time of idealism
and heroic spirit.</i>

278
00:31:19,892 --> 00:31:22,492
<i>The flowers fly hither
and thither.</i>

279
00:31:22,493 --> 00:31:25,493
<i>And I'll soon follow them.</i>

280
00:31:25,494 --> 00:31:27,894
<i>The same will come to pass for us all.</i>

281
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:40,926
In which ward is Wen-leung?

282
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,364
I see him now.

283
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:54,374
<i>Wen-leung, business is what men
are for, isn't it?</i>

284
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,739
<i>Men can do any kind
of work.</i>

285
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:01,974
Now that you have recovered,
you can do anything.

286
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:05,920
You have six boats in your family,

287
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,991
...laden with rice and sugar...

288
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,461
...and ready to set sail to make a lot
of money in China.

289
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,828
Those boats are ideal
for smuggling.

290
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:19,333
We'd make a lot of money
with a single round trip.

291
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:22,331
What do you say?

292
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:30,473
I'll have to ask
my brother.

293
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,344
Ask what?

294
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,285
Do you consult him on everything?

295
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:40,186
Let's keep this between ourselves.

296
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:44,057
We Shanghai people are well
organized. Don't worry.

297
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:45,390
We'll take care of everything.

298
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,428
The rice and the sugar
are not a problem.

299
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:51,060
Come on, be shrewd.

300
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:55,071
When opportunity knocks,
it's foolish not to open the door.

301
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,434
Cheers!

302
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,512
To you, Wen-leung.

303
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,120
Ah-ga, enjoying the company
of the ladies, I see.

304
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:18,888
Ah-tao, look to table eight.

305
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,020
Excuse me.

306
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:25,234
May I present Tsun-chu
and Yen-hung.

307
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,962
Be nice to these mainlanders,
and see they have a good time.

308
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:34,403
What's this?

309
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,374
We are talking business!

310
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:40,350
What are all these women
doing here?

311
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,349
Come sit here.

312
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:44,978
Come.

313
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,283
Forget those mainlanders.

314
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:11,008
I was waiting for you.

315
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,579
I have a business proposal for you.

316
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,854
Take a good look.
Can you tell the difference?

317
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,672
Red Monkey, introduce me.

318
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,139
It's Ah-ga.

319
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,834
This is my girl, Ah-tsun.

320
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:40,968
Hello.

321
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,068
You're very beautiful.

322
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,704
And you're very nice.

323
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:45,915
Have a cigarette.

324
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:47,777
Let me light it for you.

325
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,745
Mr. Ah-ga, we were hoping
to see you more often.

326
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:53,881
You will.

327
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:55,117
Thanks.

328
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:57,194
I'm going in, Red Monkey.

329
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:06,634
These are real Japanese
banknotes.

330
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,363
We'll put a stamp on them
and then they can be cashed.

331
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,938
Is it Kimguichiu's share?

332
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,704
How many do you have?

333
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,311
A full valise.

334
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,547
Have you had an idea?

335
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,620
No problem.

336
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,398
Not now, Red Monkey.

337
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:42,366
I want to sleep.

338
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,304
Let me rest.

339
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:46,774
I don't want to do it now.

340
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:55,049
Later.
Let me sleep a while.

341
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:00,789
Who is it?

342
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,799
Hinomi, are you busy?

343
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:18,869
A bit.

344
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,014
Here.

345
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:23,570
When I was here, everyone
was so nice to me.

346
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:25,036
Take these fruits as
thanks.

347
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,411
My thanks to you all.

348
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:28,409
Thank you.

349
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:30,200
<i>The mainland police killed a
cigarette vendor, did you know that?</i>

350
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,434
<i>Yes, I heard.</i>

351
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,567
<i>- You too?
- Yes.</i>

352
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:37,580
The local people were furious.
The whole street was very tense.

353
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,080
Really furious.

354
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:40,810
Things were quite explosive.

355
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,280
The cigarettes were brought in as
contraband...

356
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,584
...by a senior official.

357
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,782
Bribery is rife.

358
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:52,795
They pursue the little fish but
leave the big fish alone.

359
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:00,429
- We don't have to smoke.
- I do.

360
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:04,474
I can't go without cigarettes.

361
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:13,340
Cigarettes are not as
important as rice.

362
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:17,550
Prices are controlled by
Shanghai...

363
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:18,952
...to keep up their profits.

364
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:22,058
The civil servants don't only deal
in contraband cigarettes.

365
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,429
They don't care if we have
rice and sugar,

366
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,623
...only money.

367
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:33,933
Under the Japanese, times were hard
but we always had rice.

368
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:38,130
In less than a year,
rice has gone up 52%.

369
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,869
But have salaries gone up?

370
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:42,677
You are right.

371
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,677
Let's face it, this is not a government;
it's a private company.

372
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,444
Governor Chen Yi is filling...

373
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:52,656
...his own pockets,

374
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,520
...not yours.

375
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:56,350
Please, eat a little of the
rice dumpling.

376
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,220
Hinomi made it.

377
00:39:59,225 --> 00:39:59,880
Thank you.

378
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:03,397
To tell the truth, that's not
the real problem.

379
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:12,272
The real problem
is unemployment.

380
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:13,343
You're right.

381
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:16,111
Since our return to China,

382
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:19,080
...many Taiwanese have lost
their jobs.

383
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:22,646
Many of them were
intellectuals...

384
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:26,945
...who weren't easily
pacified.

385
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:28,581
With no work,

386
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,756
...sooner or later
there's bound to be chaos.

387
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,728
And not only the intellectuals.

388
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:35,696
Soldiers too.

389
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,827
Yes, the soldiers conscripted by
Japan can't find work now.

390
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,637
Someone from the mainland took over
the court...

391
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:48,470
...throwing out the locals
and replacing them with...

392
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:52,337
...his own wife, uncle and nephew.

393
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,884
The court has been taken over
completely...

394
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:56,509
...by his family.

395
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,885
They follow his orders.

396
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,550
The Japanese gave you...

397
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:05,130
...a slave mentality.
You have to change.

398
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:06,400
We don't even know
how to speak Mandarin.

399
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:10,093
Slaves? Dammit.

400
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:12,999
Have we sunk so low as
to want to become slaves again?

401
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,602
The Ching Dynasty sold us out.

402
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:20,176
Who asked us if we wanted
to be ceded to Japan?

403
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:23,136
Drink up.

404
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,447
If the Nationalist Government...

405
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:30,812
...doesn't change its ways,

406
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,218
...even though we have won the war,

407
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:36,321
...our suffering will continue.

408
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:40,226
How long before we can lift up our
heads with pride?

409
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:41,092
Who knows?

410
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:42,062
We mustn't give up hope.

411
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:44,292
That would be a waste.

412
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,630
If we want a future,

413
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:52,202
...the suffering masses
have to resist.

414
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:56,278
If the Nationalists carry on letting
Chen Yi do what he wants,

415
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:59,146
...there'll be problems in Taiwan.

416
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,517
Lao He.

417
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:02,717
There certainly will, as soon as...

418
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:07,348
...Mr. Ho makes ready his pen 
to tell the tale.

419
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,600
You are our witness
from the mainland.

420
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:08,801
It's a folksong called Lorelei,
based on a German legend.

421
00:43:26,802 --> 00:43:31,802
It's about a beautiful siren
seated on a rock in the Rhine.

422
00:43:31,803 --> 00:43:35,803
Sailors are so enchanted by
her singing,

423
00:43:35,804 --> 00:43:39,804
...that they crash their boats into
the rock and die.

424
00:44:04,105 --> 00:44:06,805
I first heard it when I was eight.

425
00:44:06,806 --> 00:44:12,806
I remember the goats bleating and
the voice of an actress in the Opera.

426
00:44:12,806 --> 00:44:16,806
I used to mimic her.
My teacher said I'd become an actor.

427
00:44:49,806 --> 00:44:53,806
I fell from a tree, hurt my head
and caught a fever.

428
00:44:53,807 --> 00:44:57,807
I couldn't walk and didn't
know I was deaf...

429
00:44:57,808 --> 00:45:01,808
...until my father wrote me.

430
00:45:01,808 --> 00:45:05,808
I was too young to
be upset by it.

431
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:06,048
What's the matter?

432
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:07,843
He has a fever.

433
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,213
Daddy loves you.

434
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,185
Wait for me downstairs.

435
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:16,925
Give him something for it.

436
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,125
And?

437
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:53,522
Here it is.

438
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,000
Hello, Wen-heung.

439
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:58,940
Give.

440
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:00,802
Give it me!

441
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:12,706
What's this?

442
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:14,308
What is it?

443
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,351
How they fuck you!

444
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:21,050
Tell your boss to come!

445
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:25,555
How they fuck you! Put it out.
Why are you smoking?

446
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:27,023
Put it out.

447
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:31,358
Are you blind? Can't you read!

448
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:33,362
Shit!

449
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:37,803
You want to die young.

450
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:39,938
How could you do that?

451
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:42,377
What do you think you're doing?

452
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:46,912
Bring your boss here!

453
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:48,314
Go and find your boss.

454
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:56,817
Don't I give you enough money
for your expenses?

455
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:58,690
If this gets out,

456
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:00,763
...a lot of people could be hurt.

457
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:03,396
And I could die!

458
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:05,932
I'll take responsibility.

459
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:07,968
You'll take responsibility?

460
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,003
How can you do that?

461
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:14,165
It says here that Lin Wen-heung
is in charge of the goods.

462
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:19,879
You can't take responsibility.
Don't make me sick.

463
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:23,442
And you dress like those types
from Shanghai.

464
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:25,881
The latest fashion!

465
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,789
Lay about!

466
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,356
Where's Wen-leung?

467
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:36,891
I don't know.

468
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:38,900
You're together all day...

469
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:42,004
...and you say you don't know?

470
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,073
Speak up.

471
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:50,243
I really don't know.

472
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:02,589
Go and call Mr. Ko.

473
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:14,365
Give me Taipei 24.
