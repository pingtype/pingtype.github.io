1
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:10,294
Wen-leung.

2
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,730
Your brother found out about
the last shipment.

3
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:18,002
How could he know?

4
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,500
You ask him.

5
00:01:20,172 --> 00:01:23,369
The shipment has been seized.

6
00:01:28,146 --> 00:01:29,238
Where is Ah-ga?

7
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,508
Still at the warehouse.

8
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:02,913
Does my brother know
I'm involved?

9
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:06,484
I don't know. Ask Ah-ga.

10
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,300
Wen-leung,

11
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,986
...now that your brother knows about it,

12
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,254
...we have to go and speak to him.

13
00:02:30,876 --> 00:02:32,434
I must speak to Ag-ha first.

14
00:02:40,218 --> 00:02:42,015
What do we do now, boss?

15
00:02:42,487 --> 00:02:45,285
Let's wait for Wen-leung
to get things organized.

16
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:58,267
Do you want to wash your hands?

17
00:02:59,104 --> 00:03:00,071
Please.

18
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,650
Excuse me.

19
00:03:23,194 --> 00:03:24,786
Thanks.

20
00:03:57,629 --> 00:03:58,823
What are you doing here?

21
00:04:00,732 --> 00:04:01,824
Aren't you Ah-tsun?

22
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,832
No, you're mistaken.

23
00:04:06,404 --> 00:04:08,599
Wen-leung, what's going on?

24
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,680
We've met before, in Chiu-fen.

25
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:28,591
Leave me alone. I told you
I'm not Ah-tsun.

26
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:31,054
Her name is Ah-man.

27
00:04:31,796 --> 00:04:32,728
Leave us.

28
00:04:40,772 --> 00:04:44,572
Do you have Red Monkey's money?

29
00:04:45,043 --> 00:04:48,069
What are you saying?
Fool!

30
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:49,407
What's this?

31
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,548
Kim-tsua, it's none of your business.

32
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:57,952
Not my business, eh?

33
00:04:58,223 --> 00:04:59,656
Leave us.

34
00:05:26,317 --> 00:05:29,081
Ah-ga, tell Wen-leung
to come here.

35
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,330
Ungrateful boy!

36
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,037
You came back from overseas.

37
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:31,142
We gave you the chance
to reform.

38
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,745
But did you change? No.

39
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:37,200
You are a lowlife,

40
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,560
...and your friends are lowlifes.

41
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:42,890
Ah-shue, bring water.

42
00:06:43,261 --> 00:06:47,095
There's blood on you and in the room.
How do you think that'll be taken?

43
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:52,559
I know.

44
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:56,170
Look at your father!

45
00:06:58,243 --> 00:07:00,177
Did I ever annoy people...

46
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:02,810
...in this district? No.

47
00:07:02,914 --> 00:07:05,007
Only the Japanese government.

48
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:08,282
They called me a gangster.

49
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,754
Me a gangster?

50
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,888
The Japanese government
certainly hated me.

51
00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:20,655
<i>But it was only to help
the district.</i>

52
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:24,796
<i>I turned big problems
into small ones,</i>

53
00:07:25,203 --> 00:07:28,536
<i>...and got rid of small ones.</i>

54
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,731
<i>I never stole anything from anyone,</i>

55
00:07:31,776 --> 00:07:35,007
<i>...and that's why the local gangs
supported me.</i>

56
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,408
<i>But you do nothing honestly.</i>

57
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,000
<i>It's always something dishonest.</i>

58
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,270
<i>Look at your daughter-in-law.</i>

59
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,600
<i>And at your brother.</i>

60
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,750
<i>And you, Wen-leung.</i>

61
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,800
<i>Have you fulfilled
your obligations?</i>

62
00:07:59,337 --> 00:08:02,966
Everything was clear at the beginning.

63
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:05,209
Who'd have known they'd done this.

64
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,339
Didn't you speak to them about it?

65
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,707
Of course.

66
00:08:10,381 --> 00:08:13,009
Let's gather everyone together
and clarify the issues.

67
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,300
Ah-chuan,

68
00:08:16,855 --> 00:08:19,415
...go tell your boss
I want to see him.

69
00:08:20,225 --> 00:08:23,683
This is disagreeable!

70
00:08:25,897 --> 00:08:29,663
Ah-ga, where are those fellows
from Shanghai?

71
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:31,092
I haven't seen them.

72
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,296
Damn it!

73
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,439
It's Wen-leung again.

74
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,280
As if we didn't have
enough problems.

75
00:08:44,182 --> 00:08:46,377
I don't know what to say.

76
00:09:06,604 --> 00:09:07,571
Leave me here.

77
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:15,302
How are you?

78
00:09:16,781 --> 00:09:17,748
Where is your boss?

79
00:09:18,983 --> 00:09:20,143
He went out.

80
00:10:33,491 --> 00:10:34,617
Mrs. Ah-Kio.

81
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,000
Take a seat please.

82
00:10:42,967 --> 00:10:46,459
You honor me by coming
to see me.

83
00:10:46,571 --> 00:10:49,005
It gives me hope.

84
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,136
There's nothing that
can't be repaired.

85
00:10:52,844 --> 00:10:56,336
Everyone knows what
times we live in.

86
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:00,580
You all grew up together.

87
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:05,221
You shouldn't be 
at odds over this.

88
00:11:10,828 --> 00:11:14,127
Our Kim-tsua began this,
so he's at fault.

89
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:16,928
But the whole incident...

90
00:11:17,568 --> 00:11:21,527
...began with the return of Red Monkey's
Japanese money in Chiu-fen.

91
00:11:24,776 --> 00:11:26,437
Kim-tsua says...

92
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:30,472
...that Red Monkey was planning to cheat him,

93
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,746
...and so he went to see him.

94
00:11:33,918 --> 00:11:35,852
Red Monkey didn't want
to return the money.

95
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,977
That's how it all began.

96
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,322
Kim-tsua had a woman he liked there.

97
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,353
Maybe Kim-tsua was
in the wrong, but...

98
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:47,091
...he would never lie to me.

99
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:53,233
Red Monkey is dead,

100
00:11:53,604 --> 00:11:56,437
...and so can't give his
version of the story.

101
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,970
This fighting and squabbling
must end!

102
00:12:01,112 --> 00:12:03,444
Have some tea.

103
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:14,019
This entire conversation
makes no sense.

104
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:18,928
The most important thing is to
take care of the money.

105
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:22,696
I think it must be
split three ways.

106
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:24,434
One part for your brother,

107
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,025
...one for Kim-tsua...

108
00:12:26,737 --> 00:12:30,468
...and one for Red Monkey's
old mother.

109
00:13:49,987 --> 00:13:51,852
<i>Yesterday I went to Wen-ching's house,</i>

110
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,587
<i>...and so I didn't write in my diary.</i>

111
00:13:56,561 --> 00:13:59,758
<i>Wen-sun's wife
told me things...</i>

112
00:14:00,264 --> 00:14:02,789
<i>...about Wen-ching's childhood.</i>

113
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:05,364
<i>Of the brothers, Wen-sun
studied the most,</i>

114
00:14:06,003 --> 00:14:09,905
<i>...but Wen-ching was
the most intelligent.</i>

115
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:14,839
<i>He said his physical problems were due
to the gods being jealous.</i>

116
00:14:16,013 --> 00:14:18,038
<i>Wen-sun disappeared...</i>

117
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,776
<i>...in the Philippines.</i>

118
00:14:20,551 --> 00:14:23,679
<i>His family don't think he'll return,</i>

119
00:14:23,955 --> 00:14:25,183
<i>...but his wife cleans...</i>

120
00:14:25,523 --> 00:14:28,890
<i>...his clinic every day.</i>

121
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:31,454
<i>Every day she disinfects...</i>

122
00:14:31,862 --> 00:14:34,228
<i>...the needles and syringes.</i>

123
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:39,227
<i>She thinks he's still alive...</i>

124
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,365
<i>...and that he'll come home one day.</i>

125
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,032
<i>Then everything will
be as it was.</i>

126
00:14:46,577 --> 00:14:48,477
<i>He'll look after his patients,</i>

127
00:14:48,646 --> 00:14:51,240
<i>...write prescriptions, do injections,</i>

128
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:54,516
<i>...listen to music...
to Beethoven.</i>

129
00:16:17,168 --> 00:16:17,827
Brother.

130
00:16:18,302 --> 00:16:19,064
Who's down below?

131
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:22,071
Soldiers from the mainland.
Get away.

132
00:16:22,173 --> 00:16:24,300
What do they want with me?

133
00:16:24,408 --> 00:16:26,672
Hurry up and get out.

134
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:27,840
What's going on?

135
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,709
They have come for Wen-heung.

136
00:16:31,048 --> 00:16:32,106
They have come for us.

137
00:16:32,316 --> 00:16:33,442
Go back to bed!

138
00:16:50,368 --> 00:16:52,359
This is breaking and entering.

139
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,095
Search for him.

140
00:16:53,204 --> 00:16:58,369
They told us your son
was a collaborator.

141
00:16:58,509 --> 00:16:59,999
My son, a collaborator?

142
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,009
Somebody denounced him.

143
00:17:02,113 --> 00:17:04,581
And that makes him a traitor?

144
00:17:04,682 --> 00:17:07,082
We have to take him in for interrogation
to find out the truth.

145
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,324
Do you eat fish all day?

146
00:17:14,425 --> 00:17:16,359
What kind of mayor are you?

147
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,628
It's not easy for us.

148
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,694
Then you'll never find out
the truth.

149
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:22,629
Someone denounced him.

150
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,768
If that makes you a collaborator,

151
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:26,666
...then I'm a gangster.

152
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:31,771
I went in and out of prison
during the Japanese occupation.

153
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,438
You have to find out the truth.

154
00:17:33,544 --> 00:17:34,977
How does that make him
a traitor?

155
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,603
We'll investigate.

156
00:17:36,714 --> 00:17:38,443
Investigate? What does that mean?

157
00:17:45,456 --> 00:17:50,052
If he's a traitor,
then we all are!

158
00:17:50,294 --> 00:17:52,194
We'll make a full
investigation.

159
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,855
My son and I are gangsters,

160
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:57,627
...I admit it.

161
00:17:57,735 --> 00:18:00,533
But only for the good of 
the entire district.

162
00:18:01,172 --> 00:18:04,232
So as not to be intimidated
by the Japanese.

163
00:18:04,341 --> 00:18:05,638
If that's being a collaborator,

164
00:18:05,743 --> 00:18:08,268
...then you are one too.

165
00:18:08,512 --> 00:18:10,707
Officer, the man who denounced him
is the collaborator.

166
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,051
You can't arrest everyone
who is denounced.

167
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,881
Who are you kidding?

168
00:18:20,024 --> 00:18:21,355
Wen-leung!

169
00:19:10,341 --> 00:19:11,569
<i>"Dear uncle:</i>

170
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:15,501
<i>...yesterday soldiers arrested
Wen-leung.</i>

171
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,613
<i>They also went to the office
to arrest father...</i>

172
00:19:20,384 --> 00:19:24,718
<i>...but he escaped,
and only injured a leg.</i>

173
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,580
<i>They say someone denounced
Wen-leung...</i>

174
00:19:27,691 --> 00:19:31,855
<i>...and said he was
a collaborator.</i>

175
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,764
<i>They say he helped the Japanese...</i>

176
00:19:34,865 --> 00:19:38,460
<i>...capture many people in Shanghai.</i>

177
00:19:39,937 --> 00:19:44,033
<i>Even if were true, they must
have forced him to do it.</i>

178
00:19:49,246 --> 00:19:51,771
<i>Mother says you have friends
in Taipei.</i>

179
00:19:52,182 --> 00:19:56,846
<i>Do you know anyone who might be able
to secure his freedom?</i>

180
00:19:57,521 --> 00:19:59,284
<i>We have money.</i>

181
00:20:00,124 --> 00:20:02,718
<i>Please help us and get in touch
with us as soon as possible.</i>

182
00:20:04,395 --> 00:20:05,327
<i>Ah-shue".</i>

183
00:20:11,268 --> 00:20:12,200
I know.

184
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,162
Are you looking for Mr. Chen,
the town councilor?

185
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:21,038
It doesn't matter. We need your help.

186
00:20:21,545 --> 00:20:22,876
Why does it have to be like this?

187
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,978
It's OK. If that's how you think,
forget it.

188
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:34,149
<i>I'll prepare it.</i>

189
00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:40,594
<i>I know. Someone will deliver it.</i>

190
00:20:41,265 --> 00:20:42,197
Mum.

191
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,630
We have guests.

192
00:20:43,734 --> 00:20:44,792
I'm coming.

193
00:20:51,241 --> 00:20:52,538
They'll free him?

194
00:20:53,277 --> 00:20:54,266
They'll free Wen-leung?

195
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,643
Not yet, but I think it will turn out well.

196
00:20:58,182 --> 00:21:00,616
Why haven't they released him?

197
00:21:02,453 --> 00:21:07,049
Friends in Taipei have made
enquiries. Nanking says...

198
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,783
...that charges against Taiwanese
of collaboration will be withdrawn.

199
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,555
So I don't think there'll
be any problems.

200
00:21:12,997 --> 00:21:15,830
But first they have to
announce...

201
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:18,629
...the new regulations.

202
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:19,964
You must help us!

203
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,732
Calm down.

204
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:29,172
Maybe friends in Taipei will be able...

205
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,248
...to obtain his release earlier.

206
00:21:32,383 --> 00:21:36,149
Please, call your brother.

207
00:21:36,387 --> 00:21:37,880
He’ll know what to do.

208
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,000
Right.

209
00:21:51,835 --> 00:21:55,202
Get me Taipei 24.

210
00:22:05,849 --> 00:22:07,407
Please, do all you can.

211
00:22:12,256 --> 00:22:13,689
Thanks, thanks.

212
00:22:25,235 --> 00:22:26,361
And?

213
00:22:28,872 --> 00:22:31,898
They say the law on collaboration
is going to be changed.

214
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:33,874
Damn.

215
00:22:34,745 --> 00:22:37,908
They make laws, and they change laws.

216
00:22:38,382 --> 00:22:40,077
This island is in a bad way.

217
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,616
First the Japanese,
then the Chinese.

218
00:22:43,053 --> 00:22:46,022
They all exploit us and
no one gives a damn.

219
00:23:25,523 --> 00:23:27,523
- What's going on?
- It's urgent.

220
00:23:28,024 --> 00:23:29,524
OK, we'll talk later.

221
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,600
Brother.

222
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,024
Sit down.

223
00:24:07,504 --> 00:24:08,596
Sit down, please.

224
00:24:24,988 --> 00:24:26,148
I am sorry to trouble you...

225
00:24:27,491 --> 00:24:29,584
...while you are enjoying yourselves.

226
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:34,495
My brother has been arrested
and imprisoned.

227
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:38,760
You know people
in power.

228
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:40,734
I need your help.

229
00:24:42,673 --> 00:24:45,039
Can you arrange for him to be
set free for New Year?

230
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:49,278
Wen-heung is sorry to bother you,

231
00:24:49,513 --> 00:24:51,777
...but his brother has been arrested.

232
00:24:51,882 --> 00:24:55,716
He'd like your help so he
can be released for New Year.

233
00:24:57,821 --> 00:25:00,346
They want Wen-leung...

234
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,221
...to be released before New Year.

235
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:08,089
When did they arrest him?
I knew nothing of this.

236
00:25:10,901 --> 00:25:12,163
I didn't know either.

237
00:25:13,337 --> 00:25:16,397
They didn't know Wen-leung
had been arrested.

238
00:25:16,506 --> 00:25:18,497
How can we help?

239
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:23,106
Hypocrites! It's all your fault!

240
00:25:23,213 --> 00:25:24,805
Shut up!

241
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,806
Idiot!

242
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,577
Can't you keep
your mouth shut?

243
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:43,291
Tell them...

244
00:25:44,902 --> 00:25:46,460
...that I know what to do.

245
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,496
It's all fixed.

246
00:25:51,074 --> 00:25:53,668
He says he knows
the rules.

247
00:25:53,944 --> 00:25:55,172
It's all there.

248
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,200
He's back!

249
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,700
He's back!

250
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,462
Put him down here.

251
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:53,959
Wen-leung!

252
00:26:54,204 --> 00:26:55,432
Bring medicines,

253
00:26:56,139 --> 00:26:57,265
...a container and a spoon!

254
00:26:57,474 --> 00:26:58,566
Wen-leung,

255
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,002
...how could they have beat you like that?

256
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,383
Hurry, fetch a doctor!

257
00:27:10,654 --> 00:27:12,349
Calm down.

258
00:27:12,522 --> 00:27:14,649
Crying won't help.

259
00:27:16,693 --> 00:27:17,785
Calm down.

260
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,163
Bring water.

261
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,297
<i>Am I talking to the clinic?</i>

262
00:27:25,035 --> 00:27:30,166
<i>Is the doctor there?
Please, hurry up.</i>

263
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,706
Open your mouth.

264
00:27:46,023 --> 00:27:47,718
Why is there so much blood?

265
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,024
He was OK in the car.

266
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:53,028
The vibrations must have made
him lose blood.

267
00:27:53,263 --> 00:27:54,560
Damn.

268
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,765
Did you call?

269
00:27:57,868 --> 00:27:58,596
Yes.

270
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,235
I'll call again.

271
00:28:01,004 --> 00:28:02,028
Open your mouth.

272
00:28:05,042 --> 00:28:07,135
<i>Get me the Hui-an Clinic.</i>

273
00:28:08,945 --> 00:28:10,572
Tell him it's urgent!

274
00:28:10,473 --> 00:28:11,773
OK!

275
00:28:11,874 --> 00:28:13,774
Is that the clinic?

276
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,375
I'm calling from "Little Shanghai".

277
00:28:15,576 --> 00:28:16,576
Is the doctor on his way?

278
00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:28,277
I don't know why,

279
00:31:29,646 --> 00:31:31,580
...but I have had a lot of
bad dreams lately.

280
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,907
They were about dad...

281
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:38,078
...tying me to a telegraph
pole when I was a boy.

282
00:31:45,795 --> 00:31:46,819
Did you boil the water?

283
00:31:48,932 --> 00:31:49,899
Yes.

284
00:31:58,642 --> 00:32:00,473
I remember.

285
00:32:01,678 --> 00:32:03,305
It was just before New Year.

286
00:32:04,581 --> 00:32:08,176
When my father was young,
he loved gambling.

287
00:32:10,086 --> 00:32:12,316
We had no money and mum...

288
00:32:12,422 --> 00:32:15,220
...took out a gold necklace...

289
00:32:15,692 --> 00:32:17,421
...and asked dad
to pawn it.

290
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:21,322
My mother was afraid that dad...

291
00:32:22,966 --> 00:32:26,925
...would gamble away the money
and sent me with him.

292
00:32:27,671 --> 00:32:32,608
As soon as my father had the
money in his hand,

293
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:36,042
...he persuaded me to stand
next to a telegraph pole.

294
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:41,812
He then tied me to it with his belt
and went off to bet.

295
00:32:43,153 --> 00:32:45,519
It was December and
very cold.

296
00:32:48,191 --> 00:32:50,125
No one went by.

297
00:32:52,162 --> 00:32:54,153
It was almost 9 before someone...

298
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,892
...saw me and untied me.

299
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,163
I almost died of the cold.

300
00:33:01,171 --> 00:33:04,800
After that, whenever
mum asked me...

301
00:33:04,908 --> 00:33:07,433
...to go with dad, I refused.

302
00:33:38,343 --> 00:33:39,776
<i>Citizens of Taiwan:</i>

303
00:33:40,745 --> 00:33:45,011
<i>On the night of the 27th, during
an investigation in Taipei,

304

<i>...unfortunately
someone was killed.
</i>

305
00:33:49,754 --> 00:33:50,982
<i>I have already take the matter...</i>

<i>...in my own hands.</i>

<i>The people who killed others
during this incident...</i>

308
00:33:57,695 --> 00:34:01,153
<i>...have already been brought to court
to be judged...</i>

309
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:03,458
<i>....and punished.</i>

310
00:34:04,302 --> 00:34:06,270
<i>We have ordered medical attention...</i>

311
00:34:06,838 --> 00:34:08,396
<i>...for a woman with light wounds.</i>

312
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,367
<i>I have asked for her to be treated</i>

313
00:34:11,876 --> 00:34:13,800
<i>And I have given her money
for the sake of her tranquility.</i>

314
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:22,517
We have to leave for Taipei.

315
00:34:27,225 --> 00:34:31,161
<i>Today, the radio spoke of
riots in Taipei...</i>

316

<i>...between Taiwanese
and mainlanders.</i>

317
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:36,466
<i>Taiwan is under martial law.</i>

318
00:34:38,803 --> 00:34:41,203
<i>In the hospital we are
all scared.</i>

319
00:34:41,906 --> 00:34:45,034
<i>One war has just ended.</i>

320
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,701
<i>Is another about to begin?</i>

321
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,009
<i>My brother came to see me.</i>

322
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:53,681
<i>He is going to Taipei with Wen-ching.</i>

323
00:34:54,352 --> 00:34:55,319
<i>But this time...</i>

324
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,620
<i>...it's very dangerous to go there.</i>

325
00:34:58,089 --> 00:35:00,614
<i>They have urgent
business there.</i>

326
00:35:01,426 --> 00:35:05,260
<i>I'm very worried but
dare not say anything.</i>

327
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:08,392
<i>Wen-ching with his disability...</i>

00:35:38,162 --> 00:35:38,958
Where?

330
00:36:13,031 --> 00:36:15,499
Death to the mainlanders!

331
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:24,139
Halt, this is a hospital.

332
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,880
Hurry, take him in.

333
00:36:43,294 --> 00:36:46,195
This is a hospital, you can't make
a disturbance.

334
00:36:46,297 --> 00:36:48,492
Get out of here.

335
00:36:53,104 --> 00:36:54,594
<i>Citizens of Taiwan:</i>

336
00:36:55,273 --> 00:36:57,867
<i>Yesterday measures were announced...</i>

337
00:36:58,309 --> 00:37:00,470
<i>...to control disorder,</i>

338
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:04,947
<i>...and I hope they were
heard and understood.</i>

339
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:08,448
<i>Now, to restore...</i>

340
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,611
<i>...calm and order quickly,</i>

341
00:37:10,822 --> 00:37:13,017
<i>...I am issuing more merciful measures.</i>

342
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:17,385
<i>They are as follows:</i>

343
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:22,830
<i>First, regarding those involved...</i>

344
00:37:22,967 --> 00:37:27,529
<i>...the government will not go ahead...</i>

345
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:29,800
<i>...and punish them.</i>

346
00:37:30,341 --> 00:37:33,538
<i>Second, those arrested...</i>

347
00:37:33,678 --> 00:37:36,511
<i>...for taking part in the disorder,</i>

348
00:37:36,681 --> 00:37:38,080
<i>...will be set free.</i>

349
00:37:38,483 --> 00:37:41,680
<i>They'll be taken to police
headquarters...</i>

350
00:37:41,786 --> 00:37:45,153
<i>...where their families will be able to come by
and look for them.</i>

351
00:37:45,256 --> 00:37:48,191
<i>To make things simpler,</i>

352
00:37:48,326 --> 00:37:50,556
<i>...mayors will issue no guarantees.</i>

353
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:54,389
<i>Third, the wounded
and the dead...</i>

354
00:37:54,699 --> 00:37:57,395
<i>...whatever their jobs,</i>

355
00:37:57,502 --> 00:38:00,437
<i>...whether Taiwanese or mainlanders,</i>

356
00:38:00,672 --> 00:38:05,541
<i>...will receive medical attention or
appropriate compensation.</i>

357
00:38:05,877 --> 00:38:10,041
<i>Fourth, a special committee...</i>

358
00:38:10,181 --> 00:38:12,945
<i>...will be set up.</i>

359
00:38:13,284 --> 00:38:16,617
<i>It will consist of
representatives of the government,</i>

360
00:38:16,754 --> 00:38:19,780
<i>...the judicial and
municipal authorities.</i>

361
00:38:20,124 --> 00:38:23,457
<i>It will also include
members of the public...</i>

362
00:38:24,028 --> 00:38:28,931
<i>...with the aim of reflecting
true public opinion.</i>

363
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,638
What are you doing here?

364
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,350
And my brother?

365
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,200
Doctor! Come quickly!

366
00:39:26,758 --> 00:39:28,225
<i>Citizens of Taiwan:</i>

367
00:39:29,193 --> 00:39:32,458
<i>Yesterday saw the temporary
reintroduction of martial law.</i>

368
00:39:33,364 --> 00:39:39,701
<i>I want to assure all those of you
who love peace,</i>

369
00:39:40,738 --> 00:39:42,638
<i>...that this decree is...</i>

370
00:39:43,407 --> 00:39:45,807
<i>...for your protection.</i>

371
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:50,539
<i>Take no notice of rumors
about spies,</i>

372
00:39:50,982 --> 00:39:54,315
<i>...because suspicion
leads to fear.</i>

373
00:39:55,086 --> 00:39:56,849
<i>I assure all
citizens...</i>

374
00:39:57,255 --> 00:40:01,282
<i>... who obey the law,
that nothing will happen to them.</i>

375
00:40:03,161 --> 00:40:05,561
<i>Meanwhile, I am announcing
the reintroduction of martial law.</i>

376
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:11,033
<i>Our objective is merely to punish
rebels and traitors.</i>

377
00:40:11,969 --> 00:40:13,732
<i>For every day they are
at large,</i>

378
00:40:14,305 --> 00:40:18,401
<i>...peace loving people will have
to put up with another day of disorder.</i>

379
00:41:28,302 --> 00:41:31,502
<i>Hinoe is safe.
She asked me to come first.</i>

380
00:41:31,503 --> 00:41:34,503
<i>Mr. Lin, the teacher, is
in the special committee.</i>

381
00:41:34,504 --> 00:41:38,004
<i>Many in Taipei died.
People are frightened.</i>

382
00:41:54,672 --> 00:41:55,832
Dead?

383
00:42:31,609 --> 00:42:33,042
Where are you from?

384
00:42:35,646 --> 00:42:36,977
Where are you from?

385
00:42:38,883 --> 00:42:39,872
Where are you going?

386
00:42:46,223 --> 00:42:47,622
I am... Taiwanese.

387
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,700
Are you from Japan?

388
00:42:55,235 --> 00:42:56,885
Are you from Japan?

389
00:42:59,937 --> 00:43:01,097
Must be a mainlander.

390
00:43:01,339 --> 00:43:02,271
What are you doing?

391
00:43:06,744 --> 00:43:07,904
He is deaf.

392
00:43:09,113 --> 00:43:11,741
He can't hear
what you are saying.

393
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,350
Wen-ching.

394
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,200
Wen-ching.

395
00:44:27,224 --> 00:44:28,714
What's the matter, brother?

396
00:44:37,768 --> 00:44:39,668
Is it fractured?

397
00:44:43,808 --> 00:44:45,435
I don't know.

398
00:45:17,842 --> 00:45:19,503
Lin has disappeared.

399
00:45:20,144 --> 00:45:22,704
They've arrested everyone 
in the special committee.

400
00:45:25,249 --> 00:45:27,012
The troops of Chen Yi...

401
00:45:27,118 --> 00:45:29,086
...are killing and arresting people.

402
00:46:51,502 --> 00:46:54,062
Your son has come back, ma'am.

403
00:47:01,912 --> 00:47:04,176
You are back!
I was so worried.

404
00:47:04,548 --> 00:47:07,381
Soldiers and police
came here every day.

405
00:47:07,985 --> 00:47:10,385
They were right on the doorstep.

406
00:47:15,492 --> 00:47:17,187
What's wrong with your foot?

407
00:47:20,598 --> 00:47:22,122
Is it serious?

408
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,543
What are you doing? It's good
that he's back!

409
00:47:41,885 --> 00:47:45,116
You can't stay here.
I'll hide you in Lai-Liao.

410
00:47:45,889 --> 00:47:46,787
Hinomi,

411
00:47:47,424 --> 00:47:49,415
...I forbid you to leave the house.

412
00:47:49,526 --> 00:47:51,721
I'll write to the hospital.

413
00:48:11,282 --> 00:48:16,185
<i>On 19th March,
the director of the hospital,</i>

414
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,515
<i>...took all my things.</i>

415
00:48:19,623 --> 00:48:22,751
<i>It was my father's idea.</i>

416
00:48:26,697 --> 00:48:30,292
<i>There was a letter from Ah-shue.</i>

417
00:48:31,835 --> 00:48:33,894
<i>Wen-ching has been arrested.</i>

418
00:48:34,471 --> 00:48:36,496
<i>They say it was for Mr. Lin.</i>

419
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:41,875
<i>Wen-ching's father went around
shouting:</i>

420
00:48:42,513 --> 00:48:46,779
<i>"They are even arresting the deaf. Where
is justice in this world?"</i>

421
00:48:47,985 --> 00:48:49,919
<i>Justice is not important to me.</i>

422
00:48:50,354 --> 00:48:53,255
<i>I only want to know...</i>

423
00:48:54,258 --> 00:48:55,953
<i>...where Wen-ching is.</i>

424
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,926
<i>I only want to know...</i>

425
00:48:59,463 --> 00:49:01,124
<i>...if he's alive and well.</i>

426
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:24,144
Wu Chin-wen, Tai Tung-ho,
to court.

427
00:53:24,161 --> 00:53:26,095
Lin Wen-ching, to court!

428
00:56:01,585 --> 00:56:05,077
Uncle, it's supper time.

429
00:57:44,478 --> 00:57:53,278
<i>Face the world
without shame.</i>

430
00:57:53,279 --> 00:58:02,279
<i>Your father is innocent.</i>

431
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:26,280
<i>At this time
of difficulty...</i>

432
00:58:27,481 --> 00:58:34,981
<i>I am apart from my loved one...</i>

433
00:59:32,362 --> 00:59:35,661
Uncle, you can't eat that.

434
00:59:35,765 --> 00:59:37,096
You mustn't!

435
00:59:50,046 --> 00:59:50,978
Wen-leung.

436
00:59:56,252 --> 00:59:57,241
Where is Wen-ching?

437
00:59:57,487 --> 01:00:00,684
He went out yesterday and hasn't come back.

438
01:00:01,124 --> 01:00:02,182
And your father?

439
01:00:02,359 --> 01:00:04,725
No idea. He went out this morning.
