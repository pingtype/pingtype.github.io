35
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,230
欢迎回家
Shh!Welcome home.

36
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,990
所以辩论是好的 但任何人都可以谈...
So debate is fine,but anyone can talk...

37
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,820
只是有时候 更需要的是行动
Just sometimes,action's what's needed.

38
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,230
改变这个世界 我完全同意

43
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,430
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

44
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,470
我只是要去 刷刷牙
I'm just gonna go brush my teeth.

45
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,990
你知道  刚才又吸烟又喝酒的...
You know, booze and fags and...

46
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,060
我不介意
I don't mind.

47
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,190
我介意
I do.

48
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,910
好吧  很快
Listen, won't be a minute.

49
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,830
我离开的时候 你不要那个哦
No playing with yourself while I'm gone.

50
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,710
什么?
What?

51
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,310
好  集中精力
All right, concentrate.

52
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,070
集中精力 不要搞砸这件事!
Concentrate. Do not cock this up!

53
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,670
你要闪了?
Oh, you're going?

54
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,670
嗯  天黑了 所以我想我可以...
Well, it's getting light out, so I thought I could just...

55
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,710
你走吧 如果你想要走的话
You should go if you want to go.

56
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,860
这真是太讽刺太辛酸了
It's very poignant. Very bittersweet.

57
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,990
真的  我只是想你可能想睡了
Really I just thought you might wanna get some sleep.

58
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,110
我不一定要走
I don't have to go.

59
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,310
不  不 走吧 我并不担心
No, no, go. I'm not bothered.

60
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,830
闪人吧
Sneak off.

61
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,060
我不是想溜走
I wasn't sneaking off.

62
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,430
-跳出窗口 没关系
-Jump out the window for all I care.

63
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,950
虽然这是五楼
It's five floors up, mind.

64
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,070
好吧  我会留下来 好吗?
Look, I'll stay. All right?

65
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,790
我会留下来
I'll stay.

66
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,270
来吧
Come on.

67
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,100
对不起  我不擅长此道
Sorry, I'm no good at this.

68
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,430
只是每当我跟别人上床睡觉
It's just whenever I go to bed with someone,

69
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,830
最后要不就是大笑 要不就大哭
I always end up either laughing or weeping,

70
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,830
其实介于两者之间也不错
and it could be nice to go for something in between.

71
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,350
瞧  这很好
Look, that's fine.

72
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,510
是啊 也许我们 可能只能当朋友
That's fine. Maybe we could just be friends.

73
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,310
好吧 朋友
Okay. Friends.

74
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,030
你知道今天是圣斯威逊节吗?
Of course, you know it's Saint Swithin's Day today, don't you?

75
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,710
什么?

76
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,750

77
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,630
你怎么知道的?
How do you know that?

78
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,470
他被安葬在温彻斯特大教堂
Well, he was buried in Winchester Cathedral,

79
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,750
就是我上学的地方
which is where I went to school.

80
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,270
那么  LA - DEE - DA
Well, la-dee-da.

81
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,830
La-dee-da
La-dee-da.

82
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,150
你知道吗 有一首诗是这样的
You know, there's a poem.

83
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,940
"如果在圣斯威逊节 下雨
"If on Saint Swithin's Day, it doth rain

84
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,350
"什么 什么 什么 依然存在"
"something, something, something remain."

85
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,230
Dexter  真有诗意
Dexter, that's beautiful.

86
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,070
闭嘴
Shut up.

87
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,540
让我们睡个安稳觉
Let's get some sleep.

88
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,190
但是  Dex
But, Dex.

89
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,510
如果不下雨...
If it doesn't rain...

90
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,910
...你想要做些什么吗?  就我和你
...do you want to do something? Me and you?

91
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,670
-你没事吧?  -抬起来  抬起来
- Are you all right? - Lift, lift.

92
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,870
好  好  我来
Okay, well, I'm coming up.

93
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,630
难道你能叫人来搬这东西吗?
Couldn't you have just hired someone to move this stuff?

94
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,750
不
No.

95
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,950
如果是我的话  我会叫人帮忙
Look, I would have paid.

96
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,230
好的  从你那边抬起来
All right,lift from your end.

97
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,210
显然  你已经从来没有做过 
You've obviously never done

98
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:43,910
在你的生活了一天的工作
a day's work in your life.

99
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,590
说真的  EM 我的航班在四个小时后就要飞走了
Look, seriously, Em, my plane leaves in four hours.

100
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,110
这就更加要你来搬了
All right, well, all the more reason why you should lift.

101
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,710
天呐
God's sake.

102
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,980
瞧  我再帮你的忙
Look, I'm doing you a favor.

103
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,030
我真的很  很感激
And I am so, so grateful.

104
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,790
别再抱怨了
Stop whinging.

105
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,630
我敢打赌  这床可以告诉我们一些故事
I bet this bed could tell some stories.

106
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,950
是啊  短篇小说  恐怖故事
Yeah, short stories. Horror stories.

107
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,870
欢迎到伦敦  把它抬起来
Welcome to London.Well, lift it.

108
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,310
我觉得我在这会很开心的
I think I'm gonna be very happy here.

109
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,750
那是什么气味?
What is that smell?

110
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,230
洋葱
Onions.

111
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,910
洋葱和失望
Onions and disappointment.

112
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,620
对
Right.

113
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,980
没那么坏吧
No, it's not that bad.

114
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,270
没什么  就是掉了点油漆而已
It's nothing that a lick of paint

115
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,630
还有个修不了的核弹头
and a nuclear warhead can't fix.

116
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,290
我有我的打字机 还有书 
I've got my typewriter. I've got my books.

117
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,150
我在伦敦
I'm in London.

118
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,500
我认为很快会没事的
I think it's going to be all right.

119

我实际上可能把这些都搞定了

120
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,790
你知道  你会遇到很好的人的
You know, you might actually meet someone.

121
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,860
Dexter 不要这样
Dexter, please.

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,980
一个好人

123
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,590
敏感  穿着羊毛衫
Sensitive, wears a cardigan.

124
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,190
我告诉过你我对这些没兴趣
I told you I'm not interested in any of that.

125
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,350
匹配的眼镜 匹配的意见
Matching glasses, matching opinions.

126
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,870
你要去印度了  我倒是很开心
I'm actually glad you're going to India.

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,310
好  因为我正要走 我得赶上我的航班
Good, 'cause I'm leaving. I've got to catch my flight.

128
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,990
这么快?
Already?

129
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,710
是啊  我很抱歉
Yeah, I'm sorry.

130
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,710
去吧 找回自己
Well, go on then. Find yourself.

131
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,950
继续给我寄的这种信
Keep sending me those letters.

132
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,870
-长长的那种 -我会的
-Long ones. -I will.

133
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,470
要开心点  EM

134
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,830
当然
Of course.

135
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,470
这是允许的
You know, it is allowed.

136
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,520
你知道吗  我有一种感觉 
You know, I've got a feeling that

137
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,150
明年这个时候
this time next year

138
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,790
你会像暴风般拿下伦敦
you're going to take London by storm.

139
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,910
请问这些菜之间的区...
What is the difference between...

140
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,310
玉米饼  是由小麦和玉米做的
A tortilla is either corn or wheat.

141
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,310
但一个玉米饼折起来塞满东西 就是一个墨西哥煎饼
But a corn tortilla folded and filled is a taco,

142
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,390
而一个填满小麦的玉米饼 就是一个玉米煎饼
whereas a filled wheat tortilla is a burrito.

00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,390
来吧
Come on.

417
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,270
这是裸泳?
So this is skinny-dipping?

418
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,870
我要做什么呢? 泼水?
What am I meant to do? Sort of lark about? Splash you or something?

419
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,870
表情很严肃
That's a very serious face.

420
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,030
你不是在内个吧
You're not having a wee, are you?

421
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,470
不
No.

422
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,830
不  我只想说
No, I just wanted to say that

423
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,110
我也有一样的感觉
I felt the same.

424
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,470
自从我们差点内个以后
After our near-miss.

425
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,470
当然  我没有写诗  我不是疯子
I mean, I didn't write poems or anything. I'm not insane.

426
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,390
但是  我想到了你
But, you know, I thought about you.

427
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,750
我想你
I think about you.

428
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,990
你和我
You and me.

429
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,590
真的吗?
Really?

430
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,590
真的吗? 
Really? Okay, well...

431
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,740
问题是我对每一个人都有这种感觉
The problem is I fancy pretty much everyone.

432
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,620
-我懂了  -任何人
-Oh. I see. -I mean anyone.

433
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,430
真的  就像我刚出狱一样  每次都这样
Really, I mean, it's like I've just got out of prison, all the time.

434
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,390
这是一个现实的问题 我可以想像
It's a real problem. I can imagine.

435
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,940
是啊  但跟Ingrid有关的  就是跟性有关
Yeah, and this thing with Ingrid, it's a sex thing.

436
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,230
这只是性爱  仅仅是性爱  完全是性爱
It's just sex, sex, sex, sex, sex.

437
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,620
我听懂了  Dex
The point's been made, Dex.

438
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,260
但我和你  却不一样
But me and you, it would be different.

439
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,030
我想我们会希望得到不同的东西
I think we'd want different things,

440
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,580
我不认为我准备好了  你懂的
and I don't think I'm ready, you know.

441
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,300
如果你想开心点
If you wanted to, you know, have a bit of fun,

442
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,820
享受假期  一身轻松
holiday fling, no obligations.

443
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,030
天呐  我当你说"不"了  行么
Oh, God. I'll take that as a no then, shall I?

444
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,390
我想是这样的 我觉得我们在一起的时刻已经过去了
I think so. I think our moment's passed.

445
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,110
我怎么也说不清
Come on, I'm not expressing myself clearly.

446
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,030
不  不  你说清了  Dex 这就是问题所在
No, no, you are, Dex. That's the problem.

447
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,510
你担心我会在意
You're worried I might care.

448
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,670
嘿! 嘿  回来!
Hey! Hey, Come back here!

449
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,110
回来 你这个...嘿!
Come back, you little... Hey!

450
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,550
小偷! 回来 回到这里来
Thieves! Come back. Come back here.

451
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,110
等一下!
Wait!

452
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,990
他们已经偷了我的衣服! 你这个...
They've stolen my clothes! You little...

453
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,390
有人帮忙叫警察吗? 等等! 回来!
Will someone call the police? Wait! Come back!

454
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,380
你别笑了  帮帮忙好吗?
Could you please stop laughing and do something to help?

455
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,390
Armani  那件衣服
Armani, that suit was.

456
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,150
这小子 甚至把我的内裤也拿走了
The little frogs even took my underpants.

457
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,220
Armani?
Armani?

458
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,460
不  Calvin Klein
No, Calvin Klein.

459
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,070
哦  Dex  我很抱歉
Oh, Dex, I'm so sorry.

460
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,710
法国鬼子!
Little French bastards!

461
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,630
他们还把你的帆布鞋拿走了
They took your plimsolls, too.

462
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,470
那不是帆布鞋  我从不穿帆布鞋
They're not plimsolls. I've never worn plimsolls in my life.

463
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,470
他们连一分钱都偷 我的爱死他们了!
They were penny loafers, and I bloody loved them!

464
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,190
什么? 这不好笑 我犯罪的受害者
What? It's not funny. I'm a victim of crime here.

465
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,540
什么?
What?

466
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,150
你那条C&K牌的内裤
Your Calvin Klein underpants.

467
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,990
我会找到他们
I'll find them.

468
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,670
我向你发誓 我会跟踪他们
I swear to you, I shall track them down.

469
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,990
进入睡眠状态
Go to sleep.

470
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,980
我不知道我们打破了多少条规则
I wonder how many rules we broke.

471
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,910
全部
All of them.

472
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,310
除了拼字游戏
Except Scrabble.

473
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,990
明天就会打破了
Tomorrow, maybe.

474
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,550
谁说高清电视不行了?
Who says quality TV is dead?

475
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,350
广告之后更精彩
Plenty more of this when we come back after the break,

476
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,470
所以不要走开
so do not go away.

477
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,150
我警告你  我们知道你住的地方
I'm warning you. We know where you live.

478
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,790
滚  离开这里
Go on, get out of here.

479
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,950
你看  我刚打电话让你知道这件事
Look, I just called, all right, to let you know

480
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,830
你是我曾经有过的最好的朋友
that you are the best friend I've ever had.

481
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,470
我很感动  Dex  但你自己脸都看不见了
I'm touched, Dex, but you're off your face. And?

482
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,430
你看  早上5点了  回家吧
Look, it's 5:00 in the morning. Go home.

483
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,710
而且你一个令人难以置信的身体
And you have an incredible body.

484
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,500
是 Dexter ?
Is that Dexter?

485
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,390
答应我你会回家  好吗?
Just promise me you'll go home, please?

486
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,230
我会  我会  我会 我会  我会  我会
I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will.

487
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,830
Dex  你早上还要上班  Dex ...
Dex, you have work in the morning. Dex...

488
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,390
晚安  好吧
Look, good night, all right?

489
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,070
记住  你真的很完美
Remember, you are absolutely, truly amazing.

490
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,910
你真了不起
You're amazing

491
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,910
而且出名
and famous.

492
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,630
我并不是那么出名
I'm not that famous.

493
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,950
最近怎么了  老头?
Aye, aye. How are you, old man?

494
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,230
你母亲在楼上 她早上一直在等你
Your mother's upstairs. She's been waiting all morning for you.

495
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,190
天哪  为什么你出这么多汗呢?
Good God, why are you sweating like that?

496
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,350
今天很热
Well, it's a hot day.

497
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,630
不  
No, it's not.

498
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,670
她怎么样?
Look, how is she?

499
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,350
那么  为什么你不自己去看看?
Well, why don't you go and see?

500
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,340
妈妈?
Mum?

501
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,030
你好  你好
Hello, hello.

502
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,550
你好  陌生人
Hello, stranger.

503
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,630
瞧  我给你买好了礼物
Look, I've got a present for you here.

504
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,180
这不是我送的 是 Emma 送的
It's not from me. It's from Emma.

505
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,950
在这里  让我来
Here, let me.

506
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,270
谢谢
Thank you.

507
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,190
多么口爱
Oh, how lovely.

508
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,870
可能是一个小小的野心
A little ambitious maybe.

509
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,310
你可能会逼她写短篇小说的
You might want to push her towards short stories in the future.

510
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,270
妈妈  不
Mum, don't.

511
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,460
你最近忙什么?
So what have you been up to?

512
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,050
我是 Dexter Mayhew  
I'm Dexter Mayhew.

513
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,350
我们已经给你准备好一个很好的表演
What a show we've got for you tonight.

514
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,430
我们已经有了一个...
We've got a man who claims...

515
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,990
跳过这一段吧
I'll skip this next bit.

516
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,430
接受记者采访时 就不错了
There's an interview that's pretty good.

517
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,870
也许迟点会看的
Perhaps I'll watch it later.

518
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,190
现场表演总是有点不平衡
The live show is always a bit patchy.

519
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,470
我不明白为什么你要用这种声音说话
I don't understand why you have to use that voice,

520
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,710
但我想我不介意这样的事情
but then I suppose I just don't care for this sort of thing.

521
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,910
这只是一点为孩子们准备的小乐趣
It's just a bit of fun for kids.

522
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,230
他们都是喝完酒才来看的
They just watch it after the pub.

523
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,710
你的意思是我不够醉?
You mean I'm not drunk enough?

524
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,310
不  不是这样的
No, it's not that.

525
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,280
你知道  说实话  Dexter  
You know, honestly, Dexter.

526
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,230
在笼子里跳舞的女孩
Dancing girls in cages.

527
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,270
这就是你干的事?
Is this what it's come to?

528
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,710
我只是举办的人
I just host it.

529
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,470
这仅仅是达到目的的手段
It's a means to an end, that's all.

530
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,830
但要达到什么目的?
But to what end?

531
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,110
我们总是说你可以做任何你想要做的事
We always said you could do anything you wanted.

532
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,830
好 你要我做什么?
Fine. What do you want me to do?

533
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,750
-好事  -这就是好事
-Something good.  -It is good.

534
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,070
我只是做本分 瞧  这就是我能做的
I just do what I'm told. Look, this is what I can do.

535
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,310
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

536
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,990
这些药让我糜烂
The medication makes me ratty.

537
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,430
我只需要躺下来  我今晚会好点的
I just need a little lie-down. I'll be better tonight.

538
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,900
是啊  你知道  嗯...
Yeah, you know, um...

539
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,830
其实  我们今晚有一场首映
Actually, I've got this premiere thingy tonight.

540
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,150
我很抱歉 我不能错过侏罗纪公园
Look, I'm sorry. I can't miss it. It's Jurassic Park.

541
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,630
我怕我可能需要一些帮助
I'm afraid I'm going to need some help.

542
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,630
你没事吧? 来  抱着我
Are you all right? Here, put your arm around me.

543
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,590
好了没?
All right. All right?

544
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,870
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

545
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,940
没事
Yes.

546
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,270
我可以给你什么呢? 水? 干马提尼?
Can I get you anything? Water? Dry martini?

547
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,230
几点了?
What time is it?

548
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,870
6:15
Quarter past 6:00.

549
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,030
是的  我必须要打瞌睡了
Yeah, I must have dozed off.

550
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,950
我怕你已经错过了我们的一天
I'm afraid you've missed our day.

551
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,990
你父亲有点生你的气
Your father's a little angry with you.

552
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,590
我今晚会留下来
Look, I'll stay tonight.

553
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,180
不  你去吧
No. You go.

554
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,870
看着你跟你爸吵架很不爽
No pleasure for me watching you and your father snarling at each other.

555
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,990
我能说实话吗?
Can I speak frankly?

556
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,310
非得说吗?
Do you have to?

557
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,110
我认为这是我的特权
I think it's my prerogative.

558
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:55,150
我知道你要当好人  体面  有爱心 
I know that you're going to be a fine man. Decent, loving, accomplished.

559
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,510
但我不认为你已经到达了那个水平
But I don't think you're there yet.

560
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,510
而现在  我很担心
And right now, well, I worry

561
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,750
你已经不像以前那么好了
that you're not very nice anymore.

562
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,830
对此我真没什么可以说
Well, there's nothing I can say to that.

563
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,070
你不需要说
There is nothing you have to.

564
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,550
我不打算跟你争论
I'm not going to argue with you.

565
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,390
当你清醒的时候你可以来拿你的车
You can come and collect your car when you're sober.

566
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,350
你真荒谬 我的意思是你不能没收我的车钥匙
You're being ridiculous. I mean, you cannot confiscate my car key.

567
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,150
你别再侮辱我的智商!
Do not dare to insult my intelligence!

568
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,630
你妈妈非常爱你 你知道的
Now your mother loves you very much. You know that.

569
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,670
但是在她生命的最后时光...
But for whatever time she has left to her...

570
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,910
如果你再敢在这种状态下来看你的母亲
If you ever, ever come to see your mother in this state again,

571
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,190
我是不会让你进门的
I will not let you in the house.

572
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,620
我会请你吃闭门羹  现在...
I will close the door in your face. Now...

573
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,820
走吧
Go.

574
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,750
好吧
Fine.

575
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,870
你不在  我只记得今晚你有约会
You're not there. I just remembered you're on a hot date tonight.

576
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,870
太迟了
I'm too late.

577
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,910
好吧  你收到这个的时候你可以给我打电话吗?
Okay, can you call me when you get this?

578
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,430
我只是想跟别人说说话
It's just I need to speak to someone.

579
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,150
不是别人  是你
Not someone. You.

580
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,910
一只电锯装在手臂上  这真是疯了
A chainsaw for an arm. It was mad.

581
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,350
这真是惊天地泣鬼神的作品
It's a work of timeless beauty.

582
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,740
我觉得这是最好的三部曲
It's the finest of the trilogy, methinks.

583
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,670
而我不看 鬼玩人 头两部都能看懂它
And I still understood it without seeing Evil Dead I or Evil Dead II.

584
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,110
我唯一的抱怨是这不够暴力
My only complaint would be that there wasn't enough violence.

585
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,620
你不介意吧  
You didn't mind, did you?

586
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,070
你想看 蓝色情挑 ?
Or did you want to see Three Colors: Blue?

587
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,700
我要跳过开胃菜因为我有这些玉米片
I'm gonna skip a starter because I had those nachos,

588
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,790
但你可以继续  你可以点任何你喜欢的东西
but you go ahead. You can have anything you like.

589
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,830
什么菜值14英镑以上?
Anything up to the value of, say, 14.00?

590
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,310
不  不  说真的  没有
No, no, seriously, no, have anything.

591
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,510
你知道 理性地说
Well, you know, within reason.

592
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,590
能再次见到你真好
It's just so good to see you again.

593
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,870
你将会成为一个了不起的老师
And you're going to be an amazing teacher.

594
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,630
-恭喜  -谢谢
-Congratulations. -Thanks.

595
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,830
我希望我有更多像你一样的老师
I wish I'd had more teachers like you.

596
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,620
只是我还没有做过任何工作  Morley 老师
Not that I'd have got any work done. Miss Morley.

597
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,590
-你有没有新的消息-
-You have no new messages.-

598
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,550
喜剧是一个残酷的情妇
Comedy's a cruel mistress.

599
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,670
有时  Emma  我认为唯一的办法
Sometimes, Emma, I think the only way

600
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,820
能让我看到我的名字被投射灯照着
I'm going to see my name up in lights

601
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,630
就是我把名字改成 "紧急出口"
is if I change it to Emergency Exit.

602
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,660
无论如何  我今晚要即兴创作
Anyway, I'm doing an improvisation night at the moment.

603
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,390
咔咔嘻 不是他的真名
Mr. Giggles. Not his real name.

604
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,040
但我觉得我要去坚持找更多的观测资料
But I think I'm gonna stick to the more observational material.

605
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,430
现在我完全明白了
I've got this whole thing at the moment

606
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,830
猫狗之间的差异
about the difference between cats and dogs.

607
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,510
嘿  别说了
Hey, please stop.

608
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,820
好了 你知不知道当一个喜剧演员
Okay. Do you know what the hardest thing

609
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,270
最难的是什么吗?
about being a stand-up comedian is?

610
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,750
是它的衣服吗?
Is it the clothes?

611
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,270
好极了  不
Very good. No.

612
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,030
是人们期望你在所有的时间都能搞笑
It's that people expect you to be on all the time.

613
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,500
因为如果你不搞笑  那么你是什么?
Because if you're not being funny, then what are you being?

614
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,950
Ian  这不是表演
Ian, it's not a performance.

615
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,910
人生就是一场表演 不是吗?
Except it sort of is, though, isn't it?

616
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,020
我看到你就已经这么激动  激动过头了
I've been so excited about seeing you. Like nervous.

617
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,710
对不起  我...
I'm sorry, I...

618
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,020
我也不擅长这东西  
I'm no good at this stuff, either.

619
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,870
只是现在我已经毕业了
It's just I graduated today.

620
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,070
我终于有资格做一些有用的东西
I'm finally, actually qualified to do something useful,

621
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,950
而我想与人庆祝
and I wanted to celebrate with someone.

622
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,350
Dexter 很忙吗?
Was Dexter busy?

623
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,620
EM  当你听到这些  
Em, when you hear this,

624
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,480
你能不能打车过来?
can you just get in a cab?

625
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,670
我会帮你给钱的
And I'll pay.

626
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:15,110
也许你甚至可以在沙发上过夜
Maybe you could even stay over, you know, on the sofa or something?

627
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,580
我只是想见到你
I need to just see you.

628
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,550
你能过来一下吗?
Please, can you just come over?

629
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,110
Emma Morley? 嗯?
Emma Morley? Hmm?

630
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,510
我能说些什么吗?
Can I say something?

631
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,350
说吧
Go on.

632
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,990
我想你完全就是胡说八道
I think you are the absolute bollocks.

633
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,310
你跟你的甜言蜜语
You, with your honeyed words.

634
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,350
我也许该回家了
I should probably head home.

635
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,630
不要走  让我们去别的地方
Don't go. Let's go somewhere else.

636
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,540
我住的附近  
I live near,

637
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,120
其实我的意思是  
actually. I mean,

638
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,230
它就像垃圾场  太可怕了
it's a dump, like, horrible.

639
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,430
但我有音乐和酒
But I've got music and booze.

640
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,950
或者热的乳白的饮料  只要你喜欢
Or a hot, milky drink if you prefer.

641
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,670
我们可以再来一杯阿华田
We could go on an Ovaltine bender.

642
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,270
好吧  一  二  三  走!
All right. Okay. One, two, three, go!

643
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,670
怎么走?
Which way?

644
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,270
这边  这边  这边!
This way, this way, this way!

645
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,270
我根本不需要  这只是友情
That's not needy. That's just affection.

646
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,350
我只是想给予更多的爱
I've just got a lot of love to give.

647
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,220
那么  如果我不能给你打电话  我能来看看你吗?
Well, if I can't call you, can I come and see you?

648
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,150
你知道火柴都在哪里吗?
Do you know where the matches are?

649
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,350
不
No.

650
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,550
你可能要离开几分钟  走吧
You might wanna leave it for a couple of minutes. Go.

651
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,350
嗨  Morley老师  嗨
Hi, Miss Morley. Hi.

652
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,350
之后那里将会有一个娱乐圈的聚会
There gonna be a showbiz party afterwards

653
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,350
有香槟 小吃和清脆的笑声吗? 
with champagne, and canap and the tinkle of laughter?

654
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,000
这是一个学校的戏剧表演  Ian
It's a school play, Ian.

655
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,230
我怀疑我们可以九时半前回到家
I suspect we'll be home by half 9:00.

656
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,370
你为什么不换换口味住在我家?
Why don't you stay at mine for a change?

657
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:12,270
我会洗我的被套的
I'll wash my duvet cover.

658
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,150
这是你的男朋友吗  Morley小姐
Is that your boyfriend, Miss Morley?

659
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,950
真无耻
Oy! Cheeky.

660
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,910
问候  男孩和女孩  欢迎
Greetings, boys and girls. Welcome to the Late Night Lock In.

661
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,990
一号摄影机  Dexter
Camera one, Dexter.

662
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,950
表演已经吃了  生活和响亮
The show that is late, live and loud.

663
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,030
Dexter  有位先生想见你

664

665
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,030
好了  各位
Hey. Okay, ladies.

666
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,950
我自己去喝茶吃包子
I helped myself to tea and buns.

667
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,830
我希望我不会让你陷入困境
I hope I'm not going to get you into trouble.

668
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,150
我相信它会没事
I'm sure it'll be fine.

669
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,390
他在那儿! 嘿!

670
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,870
他不觉得自己看起来很华丽吗? 来 Suki

Suki Sue 来这里

672
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,870
我只想把你吃到骨头都不剩
I just want to eat you up.

673
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,990
Suki  看  这是我的父亲
Suki, actually, look, this is my father.

674
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,790
Wotcha  M 先生
Wotcha, Mr. M.

675
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,070
你的儿子是不是太奢华了?
Isn't your son gorgeous?

676
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,550
嗯  他是非常好人的
Um, he's very nice.

677
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,510
M 夫人在哪里?
And where's Mrs. M?

678
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,660
可悲的是她离开了人世
Sadly, she passed away.

679
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,790
Barry  我需要一些水
Barry, I need some water.

680
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,390
真是一个可怕的女人
What an appalling woman.

681
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,940
其实她算是我的女朋友吧
Actually, she's sort of my girlfriend.

682
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,340
哦  祝贺你
Oh, well, congratulations.

683
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,340
你会让你的母亲很失望的
Your mother would have been most impressed.

684
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,100
谢谢  爸爸
Thanks, Dad.

685
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,350
我会在家里看  如果我能保持清醒
I'll be watching at home if I can stay awake.

686
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,950
玩得开心
Have fun

687

这就是你们这么生气的原因吗?

741
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,870
早午餐  它是午餐吗?  它是早餐吗?

744
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,470
好吧  我应该继续

我想我们同意 snooth 这件事

746
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,700
看来这几天我说什么都错  对吧?
I can't seem to say anything right these days, can I?

747
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,470
如果你今晚不想我去...

什么?  跟Dexter见面  然后你们都讨论我
What? Dexter ignoring me, and you talking over me?

751
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:44,630
别管我  谢谢
No, thank you.

752
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,750
不会那样的
It won't be like that.

753
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,940

我想你应该在聚会

I don't know. These days, we don't seem to...

新的地方如何? 怎么样?
And how's the new place? How's that?

793
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,300
房子还不错  一个房间
Flat's fine. Well, it's a room and a half in murder mile.

794
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,950
Ian 6个月以来一直想要
And Ian's been talking about painting

795
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,910
给那堵墙刷油漆

796
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,670
但它有潜力 有很好的风景 还有煤气厂
But it's got potential. There's a view. The Gasworks.

797

00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,300
我非常欣赏她的是她真正理解这一行
What's great for me is that she really understands the industry.

802
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,780
她确切地知道那种感觉是...
You know, she knows exactly what it's like to be...

803
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,230
我会说"出名"  我们恨这个单词
I was gonna say "famous." God, we hate the word.

804
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,870
每次我看电视转台
Every time I turn on the telly,

805
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,430
她就穿着粉色橡胶紧身衣出现在我面前
she's there in a pink rubber catsuit.

806
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,230
她的表现出乎意料的好

00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,030
好吧  我们都是
Well, we both are.

809
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,150
我想到了一些真的真的很令人兴奋的东西
I've got some really, really exciting stuff coming up.

810
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,910
都在酝酿当中
It's all sort of in development.

811
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,110
如果我告诉你  我不得不开枪打死你
If I told you, I'd have to shoot you.

812
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,590
请开枪吧
Please do.

813
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:31,030
没关系  别管我  好吗?
Never mind. Start without me, all right?

814
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,540

你在做无聊的事情吗?
What are you doing, you silly thing?

817
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,950
好吧  听着  我们迟点再讨论
Well, listen, we'll talk later.

818
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,180
看看这华丽的外表
Look at this. This looks gorgeous.

819
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,110
你没事吧? 也许她可以加入我们?
Are you all right? Maybe she could join us?

820
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,380
嘿  嘿  你在说什么?
Hey, hey, hey, what's this?

821
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,270
我来这里看你  还记得吗?
I'm here to see you, remember?

822
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,230
对  教书教的怎么样了?
Right, well, how's the teaching?

823
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,790
什么? 如果你不感兴趣   就别问
What? If you're not interested, don't ask.

824
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,430
我很感兴趣
I am interested.

825
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,870
我只是想你正要写这本小说
I just thought you were going to be writing this novel, that's all.

826
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,070
我会的  但我要赚钱
And I will. But I have to earn a living.

827
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,340
更重要的一点  我喜欢它
More to the point, I enjoy it.

828
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:20,580
我是一个好老师  Dexter
I'm a bloody good teacher, Dexter.

829
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,030
你绝对是
I'm sure you are.

830
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,430
不过  你知道他们说什么?
Still, you know what they say?

831
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,030
不  他们怎么说?
No, what do they say?

832
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,350
你知道  "那些..."
You know, "Those who can..."

833
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:32,590
不  我很抱歉  我不熟悉这些  继续吧
No, I'm sorry. I'm not familiar. Finish the sentence.

834
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,230
好  "有能力的人就干一番大事
All right. Well, "Those who can, do,

835
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,110
"没有能力的,就跑去教书"
"and those who can't, teach."

836
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,910
而教书的人就说 "去他妈的! "
And those who can teach say, "Go fuck yourself!"

837
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,670
EM! EM   无论我做了什么  我很抱歉
Em! Em, come on. Look, whatever I've done, I'm sorry.

838
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,270
你明显喝多了
You've obviously had a bit too much to drink.

839
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,190
不  你醉了!  你醉了!
No, you're drunk! You're drunk!

840
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,070
你知道三年来我没见过你真正清醒的样子
Do you realize that I have literally not seen you sober for three years?

841
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,990
每10分钟跑去上一趟厕所
Nipping off to the toilet every 10 minutes.

842
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,870
要么你是在吸毒  或者你有痢疾
Either you're on coke, or you've got dysentery.

843
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,700
无论哪种方式  都很无聊  
Either way, it's boring!

844
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:04,830
你在浪费自己的青春
Banging on about yourself all the time.

845
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,990
好吧  我不会介意   Dex   
Well, I wouldn't mind, Dex,

846
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:08,830
但你是一个电视节目主持人  对吧
but you're a TV presenter, all right?

847
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,270
你并没有发明青霉素
You've not invented penicillin.

848
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,230
你要做的就是站在一旁 
All you do is stand around shouting,

849
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:12,270
喊 "制造一些噪音吧"!
"Make some noise!"

850
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,470
你看  我很快乐
Look, I am having fun, that's all.

851
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,750
我最近经历了很多
I've been through a lot recently.

852
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:17,980
我可能会有点不在状态
I might get a bit carried away,

853
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,300
但如果你不停止责备我...
but if you wouldn't stop getting at me...

854
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,550
我不是故意的  而且...
Am I? I don't mean to, and I...

855
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,110
我知道你和你的妈妈一起经历了很多
I know that you've been through a lot with your mum and all, I know.

856
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,430
但有一些事情我需要你谈谈
But, there are things that I needed to talk to you about.

857
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,710
关于我是如何被困在这间房子的
About how I am stuck in this flat

858
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,350
跟一个我不爱的人住在在一起
with a man that I am not in love with.

859
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,500
如果我不能跟你这些
And if I can't talk to you,

860
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,750
那你在这里又有什么意义呢?
then what is the point of you? Of us?

861
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,390
你是什么意思 "这有什么意义呢?"
What do you mean, "What's the point?"

862
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,110
我认为我们已经没有共同语言了
I think we've outgrown each other.

863
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,060
不  你已经看不起我了
No, you have outgrown me.

864
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,470
你觉得我不够酷  很沉闷
You think I'm uncool and dreary.

865
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,390
我不认为你沉闷  EM...
I don't think you're dreary. Em...

866
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,360
我认为如果这一切都结束了 
I think if it's over,

867
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,110
那么我们就应该面对事实  说再见了
then we should just face facts. Say goodbye.

868
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,670
这听起来像你要甩我
It sounds like you're dumping me.

869
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,270
是啊  也许我是
Yeah, maybe I am.

870
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,070
你已经不是曾经的你了
You're not who you used to be.

871
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,190
来吧  EM  我道歉!
Come on, Em. Look, I apologize!

872
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,870
请
Please.

873
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,070
来吧 就是这样
Come on. That's it.

874
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,470
来
There.

875
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:21,230
我爱你   Dexter  很深很深
I love you, Dexter. So much.

876
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,710
我只是不再喜欢你了
I just don't like you anymore.

877
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,310
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

878
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,910
Johnny Cage 获胜
Johnny Cage wins.

879
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,830
这是一个全能取胜王
That's an almighty win from the Blade Cruisers there.

880
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,430
我想你们都会同意  干得好  伙计们
I think you'll all agree. Well done, guys.

881
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,870
今晚就到此结束  下周再见
That's all from tonight's Joy Stick Jockeys. Join us next week

882
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,790
当我们回顾你的控制台游戏
when we review the smoking hot new console games coming at you.

883
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,110
直到那时  夜猫们  继续游戏吧
Until then, night owls, keep gaming.

884
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,950
我真的要说"火得冒烟"?
Do I really have to say "smoking hot"?

885
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,510
看在上帝的份上  我都32岁了
It's just I'm 32, for God's sake.

886
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,110
什么  他们解雇我?
What, they're sacking me?

887
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,470
你看  解雇这个词有负面的含义
You see, sack has negative connotations.

888
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,510
他们只是想尝试录用一个新的主持人
It's just they wanna try a new presenter.

889
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,150
因此他们解雇我吗?
So they are sacking me?

890
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,270
哦  不  他们正在考虑一个不同的节目
Well, no, they're taking the show in a different direction,

891
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,590
跟你的节目大相径庭
but it's a direction away from you.

892
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,030
好了  你已经没有以前那么上镜了
Okay, so less you now.

893
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,070
好了
Okay.

894
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,950
你20岁的时候更自我
More you in your 20s.

895
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,910
对
Right. Right.

896
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,950
那么  好消息是?
So, what's the good news?

897
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,110
对不起?
Sorry?

898
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,470
好了  你说你有一些坏消息  好消息呢?
Well, you said you had some bad news. What's the good news?

899
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,590
每个人的事业都会跌宕起伏
Every career has its ups and downs.

900
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,100
这仅仅是一次小小的挫折
This is just a bloody great down.

901
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,910
我感觉自己终于醒悟了  Dexy
And I sense a bit of disenchantment, Dexy.

902
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,230
只是有点担心我的未来
Just a little concerned about my future.

903
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,070
它并不完全是我期待的东西
It's not quite what I was expecting.

904
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,350
未来是不可预测的  这就是它令人兴奋的原因
The future never is. That's what makes it so bloody exciting!

905
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,110
人人都爱你  是吗?
Everyone loves you, yeah?

906
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,560
但他们用一种由爱生恨的  
But they love you in that ironic,

907
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,390
无比讽刺的方式来爱你
love-to-hate kind of way.

908
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,070
对不对?  我们需要做的
Right? And all that we need to do

909
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,510
就是找一个真正爱你的人
is just find someone that loves you for real.

910
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,670
可以吗? 是啊
Okay? Yeah.

911
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,030
我爱你  Sylvie
I love you, Sylvie.

912
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,310
不  不  等一下  不  我爱上你了
No, no, wait. No, I'm in love with you.

913
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,590
你看  我从来没有和别人说过
Look, I've never said this to anyone before.

914
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,430
嗯  这是一个谎言 嗯...
Well, that's a lie. Um...

915
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,230
我爱你  Sylvie 我...
I love you, Sylvie. I...

916
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,020
Sylvie 告诉我你以前颇有名气
Sylvie tells me you used to be quite well known.

917
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,790
电视节目主持人还是
TV presenter or something.

918
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,750
我以前是主持人  
I did. Yeah. Once upon a time.

919
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,240
是的  在 Larginit台的那个节目 
Yes, on Larginit. That program.

920
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,160
你还记得吗?  
 Do you remember,

921
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:24,510
妈咪?
Mummy?

922
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,820
你以前很讨厌它的
You used to really hate it.

923
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:26,900
是啊
Yes.

924
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,590
"把它关掉"她老说
"Turn it off," she used to say.

925
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,020
"关掉它  它会杀死你的脑细胞"
"Turn it off. It's killing your brain cells."

926
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,790
那是你  是吗?
That was you, was it?

927
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,550
你仍然在电视台工作吗  Dexter ?
You still work in television, Dexter?

928
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,320
没有以前那么多了  
Not so much, no.

929
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,510
有点渐行渐远的感觉  真的
That sort of drifted away, really.

930
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,630
嗯
Uh-huh.

931
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,910
Dexter 只是谦虚  他得到很多的录用
Dexter's just being modest. He gets lots of offers.

932
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,830
无论如何  他真正的想要做的是制作
Anyway, what he really wants to do is produce.

933
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,750
聚会的游戏
Party games.

934
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,550
你在吗? Moriarty
Are you there, Moriarty?

935
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,070
在这里
Here.

936
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,580
两个不错的工作  太好了
Two for two, nice work, bro.

937
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,660
来一个帽子戏法
Going for a hat trick.

938
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,990
你在吗? Moriarty
Are you there, Moriarty?

939
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,220
在这里
Here.

940
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,590
人群要沸腾了!
The crowd goes wild!

941
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,430
我的孩子!
There's my boy!

942
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,830
下一次运气会更好的  孩子  谢谢
Better luck next time, son. Thank you.

943
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,430
好吧  我仍然为你感到非常自豪
Well, I'm still very proud of you.

944
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,630
哦  这个是不是很有趣的?
Oh, isn't this fun?

945
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,870
-Dexter  介不介意带上我? -哦  不
-Dexter, care to take me on? -Oh, no.

946
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:21,990
这是一个了不起的的想法
That's a terrific idea.

947
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,060
亲爱的  您确定吗?
Darling, are you sure?

948
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,790
是的  我肯定
Yes, I'm sure.

949
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,030
来吧  第一章 拿起你的武器
Come on, chap. Pick up your weapon.

950
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,190
很好  妈妈
Nice and tight, Mum.

951
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,750
-好吗? -好
-All right? - All right.

952
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,390
-非常好  -我们不希望你作弊
-Very good. - We don't want you cheating.

953

祝你好运  好
Good luck. All right.

954
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,350
来吧  姐姐
Come on, sis.

955
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,230
好  准备好了吗?
All right, ready?

956
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,830
准备好了...
As ready as I'll...

957
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,700
天呐! 你认为你正在做什么是?
Good God, man! What the hell do you think you're doing?

958
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,630
这桌子是来自意大利  我很抱歉
That table was from Italy. I'm so sorry.

959
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,950
我必须从一个有趣的角度打到她
I must have just caught her at a funny angle there.

960
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,830
你甚至不问她在不在那里  Moriarty
You didn't even ask if she was there, Moriarty.

961
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,260
我知道  我知道
I know. I know.

962
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,070
我很抱歉  
I'm so sorry.

963
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:04,830
你看  我不知道我在想什么
Look, I don't know what I was thinking.

964
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,180
看在我的份上不要换锁了
Serves me right for not changing the locks.

965
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,420
向好的方面看  Ian
Looking good, Ian.

966
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,750
你可以吃饱  Emma
You can get stuffed, Emma.

967
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,790
这就是你的行为?
Is that from your act?

968
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,950
没有  虽然我最近有新东西做
No, though I have got this new thing I've been working on.

969
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,310
天呐
God.

970
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:29,920
我来了  
I come on,

971
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,480
说  "这里有一个有趣的故事 
and I say, "Here's a funny story.

972
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:32,430
您一定会喜欢这个"
You'll like this."

973
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,790
Ian  "有一个人
Ian. "There's this guy,

974
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,270
"和他的女朋友出去玩  他很爱慕她
"and he's going out with this girl, and he worships her,

975
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,820
"他们一起买了一套房子
"and they buy this flat together.

976
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,750
"然后他还送了她订婚戒指和很多别的东西
"And then he gets her an engagement ring, the lot.

977
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:48,670
"结果却是她还爱着她最好的朋友"
"It turns out that she is still in love with her best friend."

978
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:49,870
这真有趣  Ian  
Interesting theory, Ian,

979
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:51,910
只是我已经很长时间没见 Dexter 了
except I've not seen Dexter for ages.

980
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,710
-没有?  -这不是原因
-No?  -That is not the reason.

981
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:58,740
你知道他是如何发现的吗? 他从她的诗中发现的
Do you know how he found out about it? He read it in her poetry.

982
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,150
你这个混蛋!
You bastard!

983
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,150
-还给我! -"我们的毕业之夜!
-Give it back to me! -"Our graduation night!

984
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,270
"同床共枕"
"The erotic intensity of the shared bed."

985
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,310
"在法国神奇的一周" 这一切都在这诗里面
"That magic week in France." It's all here in blank verse.

986
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,990
如果你再敢来这里 我就打电话报警!
If you ever, ever, come in here again I will call the police!

987
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,670
打电话给天煞的警察! 这是我的房子!
Call the bloody police! It's my flat, too!

988
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,950
是吗? 我付了抵押贷款!
Is it? I paid the mortgage!

989
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,690
你只是坐在周围放屁
You just sat around farting and

990
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,510
看着星际迷航-可汗之怒!
watching the bloody Wrath of Khan!

991
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,790
你爱可汗之怒
You love The Wrath of Khan.

992
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,590
我恨可汗之怒
I hate The Wrath of Khan.

993
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,230
幸亏我们没有结婚
It's a good job we didn't get married.

994
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,830
对不起我用过你所有的东西
I'm sorry about going through all your stuff.

995
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,510
我最近有点生气  仅此而已
I've just been a bit mad recently, that's all.

996
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,350
没事
It's all right.

997
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,190
我想念你
I miss you.

998
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,550
我知道
I know you do.

999
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,630
就像就在这里
Like, right here.

1000
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,670
要么... 我不知道
Either that, or it's trapped wind. I'm not sure.

1001
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,870
无论怎样  一切都会过去的
Either way, it'll pass.

1002
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,910
你的书写的很好
It's good, by the way.

1003
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,510
不是诗  那些诗很糟糕
Not the poems. The poems are awful,

1004
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,550
但其他的东西  那故事  你真好笑
but the rest of the stuff, the stories. You're funny.

1005
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,510
适当的滑稽
Proper funny.

1006
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,820
-不像我  -Ian
-Not like me. -Ian.

1007
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,550
不  我只是说你应该把他们展示给别人
No, I'm just saying that you should show them to someone,

1008
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,510
因为你低估了自己
because you're better than you know.

1009
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,190
哦!
Oh!

1010
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:39,830
那是 Emma Morley 我大学同学
So that's Emma Morley. We went to university together.

1011
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,140
你也跟她睡过吗?
Did you sleep with her as well?

1012
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,510
没有
No.

1013
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,740
那新娘呢?
What about the bride?

1014
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,710
不  天呐  你在说什么?
No. God, what is this?

1015
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,310
每个周末我们都会去一个婚礼
It's just that every weekend we go to a wedding

1016
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,990
跟你睡过的能装下一车了
with a coachload of people that you've slept with.

1017
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,390
这就像一个会议
It's like a conference.

1018
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:55,740
好了 来吧
Okay. Come on.

1019
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,470
你知道你是我的唯一
You know you're the only one for me now.

1020
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,270
你是  来吧  来这里  来这里
You are. Come on, come here. Come here.

1021
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,980
鹰嘴豆泥  有机果汁

1022
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,830
公平贸易的咖啡
Fair Trade coffees.

1023
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:15,260
小龙虾  Dex  人们都为这小家伙发疯 
Crayfish. Dex, people go crazy for the little buggers.

1024
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,660
我已经得到了12家分行了 年底会有另外12家
I've got 12 branches already. Twelve more by the end of the year.

1025
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,270
最近我听到一些谣言
Well, you know, there's a rumor going around

1026
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:23,990
说其实你是超有钱的人
that you're actually a multi millionaire.

1027
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,790
不是吧
Come on.

1028
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,310
怎样才叫超有钱
Well, define multi.

1029
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,950
你应该来吃午饭  我们应该谈
You should come and have lunch. We should talk.

1030
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,430
什么  你想给我一份工作吗?
What, are you offering me a job?

1031
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:37,990
不  我只是说...
No, I'm just saying...

1032
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,510
你给我一份工作  对吧?
You are, aren't you? You're offering me a job.

1033
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,030
你看  我没见过你 电视上一段时间
Look, I haven't seen you on telly for a while.

1034
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,070
我想如果你想要一个新的开始...
I thought if you wanted a fresh start...

1035
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,150
Callum  伙计
Callum, mate. Mate, mate, mate.

1036
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,270
在大学  你穿同样的牛仔裤...
At university, you wore the same pair of jeans for...

1037
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,310
穿了大概  4年?
What was it, four years?

1038
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,270
很久以前的事了
Long time ago now, pal.

1039
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,550
我们已经不是学生了
We're not students anymore.

1040
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,860
似乎有人要享受它
Someone seems to be enjoying it.

1041
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,100
瞧  看看这里
Look, look over here.

1042
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,750
你有没有 见过 Emma Morley?
Have you seen Emma Morley?

1043
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:05,400
一直就在我们眼前 啊?
Right under our noses all this time. Eh?

1044
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,590
谁知道?
Who knew?

1045
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,110
我静静坐着  默默等待
I sit and wait

1046
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:15,310
是不是天上的天使
Does an angel

1047
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,750
在考虑着我的命运
Contemplate my fate

1048
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,500
他们是否知道
Do they know

1049
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,710
我告诉你  一个发现改变了我的生活
I tell you, the one discovery changed my life.

1050
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,830
小龙虾
Crayfish.

1051
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,560
我已经得到了12家分行  
I've got 12 branches already.

1052
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:33,950
今年年底会有另外12家
Another 12 by the end of the year.

1053
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,990
我告诉 Dexter 他会有很多机会
I was telling Dexter there's plenty of opportunities.

1054
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,380
亲爱的  我很快会回来的
Darling, I'll be back in a bit.

1055
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,910
你想一些香槟吗?
Do you want some champagne?

1056
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,380
这不是香槟  是西班牙语
It's not champagne. It's Spanish.

1057
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:51,470
当我趴在我的床上的时候
When I'm lying in my bed

1058
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:54,470
思绪缓缓飘过我的脑海
Thoughts running through my head

1059
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:57,350
我再也不相信爱情了
And I feel that love is dead

1060
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,950
我爱的是天使
I'm loving angels instead

1061
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,150
你想离开这里吗?
Do you want to get out of here?

1062
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:04,380
是的  请
Yes, please.

1063
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,150
她通过这一切提供我保护
And through it all She offers me protection

1064
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,750
很多怜爱
A lot of love and affection

1065
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:16,190
跟新娘睡过  让你觉得今天很难过吧
Today must be quite tough for you, having slept with the bride.

1066
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:20,150
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

1067
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,550
什么? 你怎么知道所有这些事情的
What? How do you know all these things?

1068
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,470
Tilly 告诉我所有关于它的事了吗?
Tilly told me all about it. Oh, did she?

1069
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:28,510
足部按摩到一半两人都失控了
The foot massage spun out of control.

1070
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,190
我想你甚至用了我的橄榄油
I think you even used my olive oil.

1071
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,950
脚印踩到了厨房墙壁上
Footprints halfway up the kitchen wall.

1072
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,430
嗯  我已经没再想这些了  所以...
Well, that stuff's behind me now, so...

1073
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,830
说真的  什么事?
Really, what happened?

1074
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,590
在洗手间内个已经没有感觉了么?
Sex in toilet cubicles lose its bittersweet charm?

1075
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,270
狂欢不会让你在夜里感到一丝温暖  Emma
Well, an orgy won't keep you warm at night, Emma.

1076
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,190
当你老的时候狂欢不可能照顾你
An orgy won't look after you when you're old.

1077
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,590
说得好
Well said.

1078
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,070
无论如何  我搞砸了我的职业生涯
Anyway, I screwed up my career.

1079
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,230
搞砸了妈妈的事情
And screwed up things with Mum.

1080
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,790
事实并非如此
That's not true.

1081
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:03,060
而我搞砸了我跟她的友谊
And I screwed up my friendships.

1082
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,580
然后Sylvie刚刚来到我身边
And then Sylvie just came along.

1083
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,630
她算是救了我  真的
And she sort of, well, saved me, really.

1084
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,870
她很漂亮
She's very beautiful.

1085
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:20,590
当然  她绝对没有幽默感
Of course, she has absolutely no sense of humor.

1086
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,790
差不多吧  他的幽默一直被高估了
Just as well. A sense of humor's overrated.

1087
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,030
像傻瓜一样总是在身边
Goofing around all the time.

1088
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,270
唯一一次伊Ian 真的让我笑起来
The only time Ian ever really made me laugh

1089
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,870
就是当他从楼梯上掉下来的时候
was when he fell down the stairs.

1090
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:32,910
Sylvie  你知道  她不喜欢笑

我本来想说 gamine
I was gonna say gamine.

1227
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,860
你看起来又是什么样子?
What do you look like?

1228
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:41,910
我?  一个搞砸了的离婚者
Me? A screwed-up divorce?

1229
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:48,270
我的公寓就在不远处?我们可以...
So my apartment's not far. Shall we?

1230
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,510
你会留在这里多久?
How long are you staying for?

1231
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:53,670
我想这由你决定  真的...
I suppose it's up to you, really. It's just...

1232
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,350
我只是想说点什么
Look, I just wanted to say something

1233
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,230
说一些在电话里说不出口的事
which I couldn't really do over the phone.

1234
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,510
好了  自从我们最后一次在伦敦见面以来...
Well, ever since we were last together in London...

1235
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,790
Dexter  你说别的之前  我...
Dexter, before you say anything else, I have to...

1236
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,510
有些事情我要告诉你
There's something I have to tell you.

1237
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,620
你去约会了!
You've met someone!

1238
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,550
这很难以置信吗?
Is that really so hard to believe?

1239
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:15,470
-一个人吗? -是的  一个人 一个家伙
-A man? -Yes, a man. A guy.

1240
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:18,430
一个家伙! 他现在是男人了是吧? 我懂了
A guy! He's a guy now, is he? I see.

1241
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,690
他叫 Jean-Pierre  
He's called Jean-Pierre,

1242
01:14:19,690 --> 01:14:21,230
Jean-Pierre Dusollier
 Jean-Pierre Dusollier.

1243
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:22,510
什么  他是法国人吗?
What, he's French?

1244
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,710
不  Dex  他是威尔士人
No, Dex, he's Welsh.

1245
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,710
他的帅气  他的迷人  
He's handsome. He's charming.

1246
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:29,160
他只是非常  非常法国
He's just very, very French.

1247
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:31,070
什么  你的意思是粗鲁?
What, you mean rude?

1248
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,710
不  嚣张?
No. Arrogant?

1249
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,750
抽烟太多了  戴着一串洋葱
Smokes too much, wears a string of onions.

1250
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,990
你为什么要这样?
Why are you being like this?

1251
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,750
哦  你的意思是性感吗? 
Oh, God, you mean sexy. Is that what you mean?

1252
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:39,910
你在跟很多人内个?
You're having lots of sex?

1253
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,630
从什么时候开始我需要征求你的许可?
Since when do I need to ask your permission?

1254
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:43,190
谁会知道啊  你从来也不征求我的许可
God knows you never asked mine.

1255
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,870
但我们只是睡在一起
But we just slept together.

1256
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,070
我没有忘记
I haven't forgotten.

1257
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,830
Dexter  我们有点醉了
Dexter, we got a bit drunk.

1258
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,510
是啊  但没那么喝醉了
Yeah, not that drunk.

1259
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,470
你把你的裤子脱了放在你的鞋子上
You took your trousers off over your shoes.

1260
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,070
不  我没有
No, I didn't.

1261
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:06,540
我有吗?
Did I?

1262
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,310
我以为你在为Sylvie和离婚的事烦恼
I think that you were upset about Sylvie and the divorce,

1263
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,790
而你需要在一个肩膀上哭
and you needed a shoulder to cry on.

1264
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,430
或者睡在那上面
Or sleep with.

1265
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:18,060
而这就是我  陪睡小姐
And that's what I was, a shoulder to sleep with.

1266
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,780
这就是你这样做的原因对吧? 
And that's why you did it, was it?

1267
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:20,910
为了让我精神振奋起来
To cheer me up.

1268
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,140
反正这奏效了
Well, it worked, didn't it?

1269
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:33,660
那是我生命中最美好的夜晚之一
If you must know, it was one of the better nights of my life.

1270
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:34,980
看到了吗?
See?

1271
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,550
表酱紫
Don't fish.

1272
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,030
Dex  只有一次
Dex, it was one time.

1273
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:45,790
才不是  三次了
Well, it was three times.

1274
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,990
来吧  你看  你不觉得这是一个好主意?
Come on. Look, you don't think it's a good idea?

1275
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,790
你和我两个人在一起
You and me.

1276
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:58,030
是啊  我一直这么认为
I do. I did.

1277
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,230
在80年代后期
In the late '80s.

1278
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,350
对
Right.

1279
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:06,070
最好动身了
Better get going.

1280
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,550
为什么呢? 我们要做什么呢?
Why? What are we doing?

1281
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:08,990
Jean-Pierre 想见你
Jean-Pierre wants to meet you.

1282
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,390
哦  你在开玩笑
Oh, you're kidding.

1283
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,430
我们要听他弹奏
We're going to hear him play.

1284
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:13,550
弹奏?
Play?

1285
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:14,620
他是爵士乐音乐家
He's a jazz musician.

1286
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:17,420
坏小子
Bastard.

1287
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,470
我们要听他用钢琴弹上九个小时爵士乐
We're going to listen to him play free jazz on the piano for about nine hours,

1288
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,310
会很有乐趣的 根本不会尴尬
and it's going to be lots of fun and in no way awkward.

1289
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,550
你不是要这样走出去吧?
You're not going out like that, are you?

1290
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,310
别废话了
Just do me up.

1291
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,270
那就是 Jean-Pierre
That's Jean-Pierre.

1292
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,500
哪个?
Where?

1293
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:07,870
噢   你至少可以找一个好看点的
Oh, God. You could have at least found someone a bit good-looking.

1294
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,640
你知道  EM  我敢肯定他是一个
You know, Em, I'm sure he's a

1295
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,110
很好的爵士乐钢琴家
fine jazz pianist.

1296
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,310
我只是不确定我可以这样做
I just don't think I can do this.

1297
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,470
哦 真的吗?
Oh. Really?

1298
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:24,070
是啊  我想我还是是去看电影  然后回公寓
Yeah, I'll just go and see a movie and go back to the apartment.

1299
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:27,710
然后我想我要去搭明天第一趟火车回去
And then I think I'm going to get the first train back tomorrow.

1300
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,070
你不一定要离开
You don't have to leave.

1301
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,510
我觉得我要
I think I do.

1302
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,590
对不起  Dex
I'm sorry, Dex.

1303
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:41,030
嘿  不要这样
Hey, don't be.

1304
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,580
去吧
Go on.

1305
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,270
嘿  你好
Hey. Salut

1306
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,870
等等!  Dexter !
Wait! Dexter!

1307
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:16,950
我以为我已经不在意你了
I thought I got rid of you.

1308
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,910
如果你耍弄我  Dexter ...
If you muck me about, Dexter...

1309
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,990
EM  我发誓 我发誓  我不会
Em, I swear. I swear I won't.

1310
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,270
引诱我  或者让我失望  或着暗算我
Lead me on, or let me down, or go behind my back,

1311
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,500
我会杀死你的
I will murder you.

1312
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:38,630
我不会这样做
I won't do that.

1313
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,150
你发誓?
You swear?

1314
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:46,910
是的  我发誓 我发誓
Yeah, I swear. I swear.

1315
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,910
我想感谢大家百忙中抽空来我们的婚礼
I would like to thank everyone for coming to our wedding.

1316
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,190
这只能形容为旋风式的浪漫
For what can only be described as a whirlwind romance.

1317
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:16,420
笑声停止
Pause for laughter.

1318
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:24,710
说真的  当人们问Emma和我第一次是怎么遇见的
Seriously, when people ask how Emma and I first met,

1319
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,750
我就告诉他们我们一起长大
I tell them that we grew up together.

1320
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,910
Blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah.
Blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah.

1321
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,990
你不会说内个的那一天吧?
You're not going to say, "Blah, blah, blah," on the day, are you?

1322
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,270
你不应该听到这个的
You are not supposed to be hearing this.

1323
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:34,470
如果我有注意到怎么办?
What if I have notes?

1324
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:35,710
来吧  让我看看
Come on, let me see.

1325
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,270
不要
No, no.

1326
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,550
当我们结婚的时候  你要绝对服从我
When we're married, you're going to have to obey me.

1327
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:42,230
是的  我敢肯定这将要发生
Yeah, I'm sure that's going to happen.

1328
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:46,910
什么? 不是吗?
What? Not again?

1329
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,430
你介意吗?
You don't mind, do you?

1330
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,030
不  我不介意
No, I don't mind.

1331
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:54,750
虽然有健康和安全问题
Although, there are health and safety issues.

1332
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:57,710
我可能会失去我的驾照的
I could lose my license.

1333
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,430
他们肯定不知道我们去哪里了
They'll wonder where we've got to.

1334
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,460
MMM! 
Mmm! Mmm.

1335
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:26,670
我可以肯定的这是烧焦的味道
I can definitely smell burning.

1336
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,670
你好  
Hello, hello.

1337
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:32,940

Hi, there.

01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,630
来这里  我们走吧

1339
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:38,670
你想给我一个吻吗? 亲我吧
Do you want to give me a big kiss? Give me a big kiss.

1340
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,510
继续
Go on.

1341
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,390
看电视只能从5:30看到6:00
TV between 5:30 and 6:00, but no more.

1342
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,310
而她7点半一定要上床
And she has to be in bed by 7:30.

1343
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,310
好  你想跑进去?

她现在很喜欢来这里
She's loving coming here at the moment.

1347
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,030
好  很好  非常好

1348

1349

1350
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:01,750

1352

-Dexter?  -怎么了
-Dexter?  -Yeah.

1353
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,390

I've been thinking.

1354
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,070

So have I.

1355
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:37,190
我想与我爱的男人要一个孩子 
I want a child with the man I love.

1356
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:42,790
如果他不想要孩子  那我和你生一个吧
And if he won't do it, then I want one with you.

1357
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,470
好吧  那我们最好现在开始
Well, then, we'd better get started.

1358
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:37,230
我看上去真疲惫
I look so tired.

1359
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,670
所以才要多锻炼  迟点来跟我游泳吧
So take some exercise. Come swimming with me later.

1360
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,150

No, no, I can't. I've got to do too much at the cafe.

1361
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,830
好 不要
Fine. Don't.

1362
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:48,580
顺便说一下  我知道你很八卦  
By the way, in case you're interested,

1363
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:49,750
事实上我没有怀孕
I'm not pregnant.

1364
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,430
EM  你怎么知道?
Em, how do you know?

1365
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,110
你怎么想的?
How do you think?

1366
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,830
但我们可以再试一次
We could try again, though.

1367
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:02,310
来吧  看着... 不  不  不  不 来吧
Come on, look... No, no, no, no. Come on.

1368
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:07,110
我很抱歉  好吗?
Look, I'm sorry. All right?

1369
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,740
不  我没有怪你
No, I am for taking it out on you.

1370
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,910
我们一直状态不佳?
We're not at our best today, are we?

1371
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:23,550
听着  要不我们下班后见面吧?
Listen, why don't we meet each other after work?

1372
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:26,870
然后去电影院看电影  你挑电影吧
We'll go to the movies. Your choice.

1373
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,870
看有字幕的
Something with subtitles.

1374
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,310
哦
Ooh.

1375
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:33,910
然后我们可以去吃晚餐  就你和我
And we can go and have some dinner. Just you and me,

1376
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,990
再然后我们就解决这个问题  好吗?
and we can work this out. All right?

1377
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,430
-我保证 -Mmm-hmm.
-I promise.  -MMM - HMM

1378
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:40,910
是啊
Yeah.

1379
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,140

谢谢 非常感谢
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

1381
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:35,250

Hey, there. Just to say I'm running late,

1382
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:36,750
不过我已经快到了

Are you all right? Go and get dressed.

1394
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:52,150
Sylvie, Sylvie,

1395
01:28:52,150 --> 01:28:52,510
Dexter? Dexter ?

1396
01:28:52,510 --> 01:28:53,270
Dexter?
Dexter ?

1397
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:56,670
Sylvie  Sylvie  我搞砸了

01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:14,950
噢   Dex   来吧
Aw, Dex, come on.

1406
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,550
你这个可怜的东西
You poor thing.

1407
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:26,420
噢  上帝  Dexter
Oh, God. Dexter.

1408
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:12,150
-由于今日连续降雨 水位开始回升
-As the rain came down,the water levels began to rise.

1409
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:17,830
那么这将是一个一年一度的节日  你觉得呢?
So is this going to be an annual festival, do you think?

1410
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,830
每年7月15日?
Every year, 15th of July?

1411
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,910
好吧  我希望不会
Well, I hope not.

1412
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,430
我不想  谈心
I don't want a heart-to-heart.

1413
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:30,940
你呢?
Do you?

1414
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,750
不  我宁可不谈
No, no. I'd rather not.

1415
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:37,590
只是说  我觉得你应该做的最好的事
Except to say, that I think the best thing that you could do

1416
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:43,790
就是像 Emma 还在你身边那样继续生活下去
would be to try to live your life as if Emma was still here.

1417
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:47,830
不是吗?
Don't you?

1418
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:55,100
我不知道我能不能
I don't know if I can.

1419
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,550
当然你也可以
Of course you can.

1420
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:04,070
你觉得我最近10年都做了什么?
What do you think I've been doing for the past 10 years?

1421
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:17,630
现在是9点 Silent Witness 要开始了
Now Silent Witness is on. 9:00.

1422
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,230
对
Right.

1423
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:37,990
Ian 上帝!
Ian. God!

1424
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,830
嗨 你好
Hi. Hello, mate.

1425
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:43,300
你呢? 是啊  看看这个
Are you well? Yeah, look at this.

1426
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,830
所以  你最近怎样?  脱口秀怎么样?
So, how are you? How's the stand-up comedy?

1427
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:48,750
我放弃那个了
Oh, well, I gave that up, actually.

1428
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:49,910
这真可惜
That's a shame.

1429
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,510
不  因为我从来都不擅长这个
No, not really, because I was never any good.

1430
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,510
我唯一的一次让 Emma 笑
The only time I ever made Emma laugh

1431
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:58,060
就是当我从楼梯掉下去的时候
was when I fell down the stairs. Really.

1432
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:01,390
不  我现在卖保险
No, I'm in insurance now.

1433
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:03,590
太好了
Great, great.

1434
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:11,350
我讨厌今天 七月十五月
I hate today. Fifteenth of July.

1435
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:15,590
圣斯威逊节
Saint Swithin's Day.

1436
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,230
这是一个艰难的圣斯威逊节
It's a tough one.

1437
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:21,000
我以前从来没有注意过它  
I never noticed it before,

1438
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,890
但它是总是在那里静静守候  
but it was always there just waiting,

1439
01:32:23,890 --> 01:32:24,310
潜伏
lurking.

1440
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:28,030
我以前也很恨你 
I used to hate you, too.

1441
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:29,990
很暴力  Dexter  
Quite violently, actually, Dexter.

1442
01:32:29,990 --> 01:32:31,470
我很抱歉  但...
No, I'm sorry, but...

1443
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:36,580
因为  她点燃了你的激情
Because, she lit up with you.

1444
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,950
她从来没有这样对我
Just in a way that she never would with me,

1445
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:45,110
这件事一直让我很生气  因为...
and it used to make me so angry because...

1446
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:50,230
我觉得你不配得到她  我可以这样说吗?
I didn't think that you deserved her. Can I say this?

1447
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,030
是啊  继续
Yeah, go on.

1448
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:53,870
她让你体面
She made you decent.

1449
01:32:56,080 --> 01:33:01,550
然后为了回报  你让她非常高兴
And then in return, you made her so happy.

1450
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:03,070
太高兴了
So happy.

1451
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:09,550
为此我一直很感激你的
And I will always be grateful to you for that.

1452
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:18,260
就因为这件事  我曾经跟她吵过架
And on that bombshell,  back to the sticks.

1453
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:20,110
看看我的宿命  看他们
There's my lot out there. Oh! Look at them.

1454
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:21,950
是啊  我知道
Yeah, I know.

1455
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,830
好吧  保持联系  我会给你打个电话
So, listen, we'll stay in touch. I'll give you a call.

1456
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:28,860
不  我不认为这是必要的
No, I don't think that's necessary.

1457
01:33:28,860 --> 01:33:30,670
我觉得我们以后不会再联系了
I think we're done here.

1458
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,350
来这里
Come here.

1459
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:35,780
祝你好运  
Good luck, mate. All right?

1460
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:37,180
你也一样
You, too.

1461
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:38,590
谢谢
Thank you.

1462
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:47,350
你的到处都是蛋糕碎
You've got cake everywhere.

1463
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:52,670
起来
Wake up.

1464
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,270
起床啦
Wake up.

1465
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:04,470
好 不要惊慌  就我一个
It's all right. Don't panic. It's only me.

1466
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:07,230
Emma  Emma Morley
Emma. Emma Morley.

1467
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,870
是的 你好
Yes. Hello.

1468
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:12,270
你有什么建议呢?
So what do you suggest we do?

1469
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:16,310
我们可以保持联系
We could stay in touch.

1470
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:19,430
今天  我们是注定要做一些东西的
Today. We're meant to be doing something today.

1471
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:22,670
对  对  对
Right. Right, right.

1472
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:26,870
你看  今天对我来说真的有点棘手
Look, today's a bit tricky for me, really.

1473
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:29,470
不  不  不是 这只是...
No, no, it's not that. It's just...

1474
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:30,860
好吧  我要去见我的父母  
Well, I'm meeting my parents,

1475
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:31,670
然后我得回来...
and then I've got to get back...

1476
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:34,510
哦  对的  你或许应该去
Oh, yeah, yeah, you should probably go then.

1477
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:39,950
能遇见你真好 再见了 
It was lovely to meet you. Bye, now.

1478
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:52,200
我迟点才要去见他们  所以如果你想
Look, that's not until later, so if you wanted to,

1479
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:56,360
我们可以去散步吗?
we could go for a walk or something?

1480
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:01,270
好啊
Okay.

1481
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,870
来吧  跟上
Come on, keep up.

1482
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:20,950
是这些鞋子的原因 我不能穿着这种鞋爬山
It's these shoes. I can't mountain climb in brogues.

1483
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:22,170
这不是乔戈里峰 
It's not K2.

1484
01:35:22,170 --> 01:35:24,170
这只是一座大山  好吧?  
It's just a big hill, all right?

1485
01:35:24,170 --> 01:35:25,310
小孩子都能爬上去
A child could do it.

1486
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:34,150
我不希望你想起昨晚的任何事
I don't want you thinking I'm bothered or anything about last night.

1487
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:36,410
我不希望要你的电话号码 
I don't want your phone number,

1488
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:38,230
或者信件 或者明信片
or letters, or postcards.

1489
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:40,070
我不想跟你结婚
I don't want to get married to you.

1490
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:42,540
也绝对不希望怀上你的孩子
Definitely don't want to have your babies.

1491
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:45,470
不管明天发生什么事  把握好今天
Whatever happens tomorrow, we've had today.

1492
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:54,270
如果我们将来偶然相遇
And if we should bump into each other sometime in the future,

1493
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:56,270
那也很好啊
well, that's fine, too.

1494
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,310
我们会成为朋友
We'll be friends.

1495
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,390
是啊  
Yeah, right.

1496
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:10,790

这鞋子 在这里根本走不动
It's these shoes. There's no blooming grip on these things.
