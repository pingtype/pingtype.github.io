巴黎是愛情的世界

沒有你 台北好寂寞

28
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:08,588
想我們兩個走在巴黎的街頭

to you soon.

34
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:26,843
再打電話給我好了

35
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,470

Bye-bye.

36
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:49,059
月色照在
The moonlight shines...

37
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,935
三線路
On an open road...

38
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:57,743
風吹微微
A breeze is blowing...

39
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:06,315
等待的人那沒來
I wait for him..., but he's not there.

40
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,683
心內真可疑
But my heart doesn't know...

41
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,255
想抹出彼個人
If he is coming.

42
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,415
說起來有點可笑
It sounds ridiculous

43
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,521
不過
But really...

44
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,821
我很久沒有這種感覺了
I haven't felt like this in a long time.

45
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,096
這個女孩子讓我知道 什麼叫做戀愛
This woman has brought love back
into my life.

46
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,030
你想想看
Think about it.

47
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:25,137
以前啊 就是這樣收保護費
All this other stuff: Protection...

48
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,329
三七仔
Prostitution...

49
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:27,531
詐賭啦
Gambling...

50
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,666
不然就是藥頭給人放高利貸
Running numbers, loan-sharking...

51
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,607
這哪有什麼意思？
It's all meaningless to me now.

52
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:34,714
豹哥啊
Brother Bao.

53
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,274
你這種情形
I think you might be having...

54
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,976
就是人家在說的中年危機
Some kind of mid-life crisis.

55
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:41,118
你有去過海南島嗎？
You ever been to Hainan Island?

56
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:41,777
沒去過
Never.

57
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,786
那你去海南島是要做什麼
What are you going to do there?

58
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,389
陪她好好過下半生
Enjoy life with her.

59
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,953
一起慢慢變老
And grow old together.

60
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,788
噢... 南海姑娘
Oh, my South China Sea Girl.

61
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:56,925
何必太過悲傷
Don't be so brokenhearted!

62
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,435
您娘啦
Fuck off.

63
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,204
不過 豹哥啊
But Brother Bao...

64
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,400
你那間房屋仲介公司 不是做得好好的？
Your real estate company
is making good money.

65
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:04,840
公司是賺錢沒有錯
Yeah, it's doing well.

66
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,036
大家都知道
Everyone knows that.

67
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,477
但是 那個是非常乾淨的
And it's clean.

68
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,510
若後面這條
But this other score...

69
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,175
我如果處理得好
If we take care of that...

70
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,117
就真的快活啦
Then I'm set!

71
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:17,148
豹哥
Brother Bao...

72
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,851
你真的確定你要這麼做？
Are you sure about this?

73
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,394
唉 你到我這歲數你就知道了
When you get to my age...

74
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,888
歡喜就好
You just want to be happy.

75
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,356
您娘咧
Fuck off.

76
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,335
我不懂
I don't understand.

77
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,465
我不懂

78
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,608
不好意思 借過一下
Excuse me, sorry.

79
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,546
這裡可不是圖書館
This isn't a library you know.

80
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,652
只是隨便翻一翻而已
I'm just flipping through this.

81
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,061
可是我每天都看你來這
But you're here every night.

82
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,795
那你幹嘛不買？
Why don't you just buy it?

83
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,266
沒有 就有點無聊
I don't know. I guess I'm just bored.

84
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,830
那你還真無聊
You must be really bored.

85
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:05,867
噢
Yeah.

86
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:08,674
我不是在笑你噢
I'm not making fun of you.

87
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,875
只是 我每天都在這裡看到你
It's just that I see you in here a lot.

88
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,109
噢
Oh.

89
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,377

Anyway, see you tomorrow.

93
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,253
好久都沒有跟你講到話了
I haven't spoken to you in a while.

94
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:31,496
如果可以的話
If you get a chance

95
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,565
還是打個電話給我好嗎？
Can you give me a call back?

96
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,662
你永遠在我的心裡
You're always in my heart.

97
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,498
晚安 我的小蝴蝶
Good night, my little butterfly.

98
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,157

大直那四間三十坪左右的
Right, four units,
each 300 square meters.

100
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,093

101
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,995
下禮拜二禮拜四會有五個客戶
I start showing them next week.

Very good.

Uncle, I got a handle
on the real estate stuff.

105
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,271
其實我絕對有能力做更多的事情
But there are other things
I'm capable of.

106
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,211

Actually,

How have you been?

300
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:28,837
嗯
Oh.

301
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:35,814
喔

302
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,183
所以 都還Ok嗎？
So, is everything okay?

303
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:44,746
喔？
Oh

304
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:50,295
我喔 我還Ok啊
Me? I'm doing okay.

305
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,329
對啊 沒什麼事
Nothing much.

306
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:57,335
怎麼了嗎？
What is it?

307
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:01,736
嗯
Oh.

308
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:11,508
為什麼？
Why?

309
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,933
你是怎麼搞的啦？
What's wrong with you?

310
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,067
家裡沒這個錢啦
We don't have the money for that.

311
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,006
我會還你們的啦
I'll pay you guys back.

312
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,470
你在想什麼啦 年輕人？
What are you thinking, kid?

313
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,582
我知道 可是我就是要趕快過去啊
I don't know...
I just need to get over there.

314
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,084
算了啦！ 真的算了啦
Forget about it! Just forget about it.

315
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,278
說不定這樣對你比較好
Maybe this is all for the best.

316
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,783
再想一想啦
Think about it.

317
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,787
或許去外面找一個工作做
or why don't you go get a job?

318
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,895
我跟你老爸也沒有冀望你在這裡幫忙啊
We're not forcing you to work here.

319
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:58,495
對不對
Right?

320
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,958
我來收 你們先上去沒關係
I'll close up.
You guys can to upstairs.

321
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:05,502
不要想那麼多
Don't dwell on it too much.

322
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,197
你需要多少？
How much do you need?

323
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,898
只要夠去巴黎就可以了
Just enough to get to Paris.

324
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,005
可能還需要在那邊多待一陣子
And maybe to stay out there for a while.

325
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,236
那沒有問題
Not a problem.

326
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,241
只是突然就這樣
It's just that...

327
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,781
我們本來都已經講好了
We had already made these plans.

328
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:19,643
別跟我解釋這一些
No need to explain.

329
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,582
感情本來就是這個樣子
That's the way love goes.

330
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,085
以後你習慣就好了
You'll figure it out.

331
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,219
豹哥 謝謝
Thanks, Brother Bao

332
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,786
我去你家吃麵都吃這麼多年了
How long have I been eating
at your restaurant?

333
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,153
你 我信得過
I know you're good for it.

334
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:37,868
唉 年輕不懂珍惜 都錯過了
Ah...the one that got away...

335
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,531
其實談談小戀愛還不錯的
It's nice to be in love, isn't it?

336
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,346
學長
Sir...

337
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,685
我們這次這個案子 有沒有機會開到槍啊
Do you think we'll get to use our guns
this time?

338
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,323
呵 學長 我一定可以的
I can handle it, sir.

339
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:16,998
你說啊
What is it?

340
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,179
啥？
What?

341
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,507
好 我知道
Okay, I understand.

342
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,315
你等在那不要動 我來處理
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

343
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,954
叫你回去你就回去
I said get out of here!

344
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,307
小凱 你要去哪裡啊？
Kai, where are you going?

345
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:02,079
喔！ 今天可能有點事 不能幫忙了
Oh,I have some stuff to do.
I can't work tonight.

346
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:03,478
等一下就回來了
I'll be back later.

347
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,545
你來這幹嘛？
Hey, what are you here?

348
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:29,573
我找豹哥
I'm here to see Brother Bao.

349
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,842
找豹哥喔？
Brother Bao?

350
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:33,306
他叫我來的
He told me to come by.

351
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:34,476
嗯
Oh.

352
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,375
確定沒有事情要幫忙？
Sure you don't need help with anything?

353
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:00,739
我還好 謝謝
I'm okay. Thanks.

354
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:11,148
二伯 他找你
Uncle, he's here to see you.

355
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,748
你沒事吧？
Don't you have something to do?

356
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:17,291
喔 我約了人看房子
Oh, I have an apartment to show.

I better get going.

358
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,630
來 坐吧 坐吧
Come, have a seat.

359
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:29,734
都準備好了嗎？
So are you all set?

360
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:30,773
差不多了
Yeah, just about.

361
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:31,806
好
Good.

362
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:34,139
我還有個小事要請你幫忙
I have a little favor I need
to ask of you.

363
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,714
喔 好
Oh, okay..

364
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:39,009
麻煩你一下 就是呢
Sorry to trouble you.

365
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,483
我有個小東西要帶過去
I need you to take something with you.

366
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,311
喔 好
Okay, okay.

367
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,359
豹哥 那... 那個東西呢？
Uh...Brother Bao, where is it?

368
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:51,053
啊！ 要你幫我去拿一下
Oh, I need you to pick it up for me.

369
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,364
喔！ 沒問題
Oh, okay. Sure.

370
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,691
別擔心 都安排好了
Don't worry, it's all taken care of.

371
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,324
到時候就有人把東西交給你了
Someone will give it to you.

372
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,196
這東西非常的重要
This package is very important to me.

373
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:01,203
你最好給我好好的處理
So you better be careful.

374
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,307
知道嗎？
Got it?

375
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:04,701

You must be very excited.

377
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,139
嗯 對啊 對啊

What is it?

380
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,144
我不知道 我只是
It's just...I don't know...

381
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,587
那個... 你機票訂好了沒有？ 小凱
Hey, is your flight all set, Kai?

382
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:21,989
喔 對啊！ 明天早上
Yeah, I leave tomorrow morning.

383
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:23,922
要不要多帶一點錢？
Do you need some extra cash?

384
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:25,589
不用 不用 夠了
No, I have enough.

385
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:27,587

你知道我們後面還有這個嗎？
Do you know if we have more
of these in stock?

393
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:35,496
我不知道 你去後面看看啊

00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:55,915
我準備差不多了
So I'm just about set.

401
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,180
我只是過來跟你說一聲
I just came over to say bye

402
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:58,721
好啊！ 那走啊
Okay, let's go.

403
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:00,347
要去哪？
Go where?

404
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:01,652
吃飯啊
To eat.

405
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:02,817
不用 不用 真的不用
That's okay, really.

406
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,053
我待會還有一點事啊
I have some stuff to take care of.

407
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:05,356
你都要走了
But you're leaving.

408
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,029
嘿 桃子
Hey, Peach.

409
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:10,267
我們一兩個小時後就回來Ok嗎？
We'll be back in an hour or so.
Is that okay?

410
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:11,900
喔
Oh.

411
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:13,900
我只等兩個小時喔
I only have two hours.

412
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,472
看吧！ 沒問題啦
See? No problem.

413
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,165
好啦！ 可我待會要拿個東西
Okay.
But I have to go pick something up first.

414
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:18,207
好啊
Okay.

415
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,860
你們看看
Look guys...

416
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:44,630
現在有什麼好處
He has this score...

417
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,533
他竟然也沒想要分給我們
And he's cutting us out of it.

418
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:48,237
我們不是兄弟嗎
Aren't we brothers?

419
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,742
一天到晚叫我們來賣什麼小公寓
Instead he has us showing
shitty apartments all day.

420
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:54,973
豹哥 已經差不多了
Brother Bao is almost finished anyway.

421
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,171
真的不用怕
There's nothing to worry about.

422
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:59,579
萬一出了什麼事 統統推到那個小子身上去
If anything happens,
the kid takes the blame.

423
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:03,447
我們幹一票 還有人當替死鬼 多好
We make a sweet score,
someone else takes the fall.

424
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:08,749
你們不是也想要幹一票大的嗎？
Don't you guys want to make a big score?

425
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:10,088
現在機會來啦
Here's your chance!

426
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:10,819
鄭先生 鄭太太
Mr. and Ms. Cheng...

427
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,452
不好意思
Excuse us.

428
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:13,996
你們還滿意嗎？
What do you think?

429
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,430
其實我們上一個房客 也非常喜歡這裡
Actually, our last tenants
really loved this place.

430
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,627
只是後來那位先生不小心偷吃
But the husband got caught cheating.

431
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,203
然後他還有外過...
Things got messy and...

432
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,100
我們過兩天 再幫你們裝洗衣機還有烘乾機
We can install your new washer
and dryer in a few days.

433
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,600
我們大概還要再考慮一下
We'd like to think about it some more.

434
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:27,871
明智 明智
Very wise, very wise.

435
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,405
其實這樣的條件 這樣的價錢
But I can assure you
for a place like this.

436
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:31,709
真的很實在
The price is quite reasonable.

437
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:32,874
這是我的名片
Here's my card.

438
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:36,746
您看有什麼需要 再打上面電話給我就好
If you need anything,
don't hesitate to call.

439
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:37,752
好好好
Okay.

440
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:38,947
謝謝
Thanks.

441
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,531
土炮啦
Morons.

442
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,794
反正我人會一直待在豹哥旁邊
Anyway, I'll be with Brother Bao.

around here?

我怎麼知道？
How would I know?

593
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:56,664
我知道前面有一間還不錯的水餃店
I know a pretty good
dumpling place nearby.

594
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,632
我也不知道啦
I don't know, okay?

我也不知道他跟那些人有什麼關係
I don't know how he's involved
in all this.

604

不覺得很奇怪嗎？
Don't you think it's a little strange?

630
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:56,584
不知道什麼就隨便答應別人
You have no idea what you're delivering.

631
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,782
你到底在想什麼啊？
What were you thinking?

632
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:04,322
怎麼啦？
What is it?

633
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,759
那個人
That guy.

警察
Police!

不知道
I don't know

我是警察
I'm a police officer!

648
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,118
不好意思 不好意思
Excuse me.

先生 捷運站內禁止奔跑
Sir, no running in the subway!

651
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,625
我們好像甩掉他了
Hey, I think we ditched him.

652
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:18,292
那很好啊
Yeah, great.

653
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:19,869
你要去哪啊？
Hey, where are you going?

654
00:42:20,703 --> 00:42:24,373

655
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:34,273
出來
Get out!

656
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:44,755
我 謝豪一定會一輩子疼惜曼曼
I, Howard, promise I
will also love Mandy!

657
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,556
永遠都不變心
That will never change!

658
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:50,566
我 曼曼
I, Mandy...

659
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:53,033
一輩子都不會離開謝豪
Will be with Howard forever!

660
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:01,310
阿姨 我們上去囉
Auntie, we're going upstairs.

661
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:02,571
嗯 嗯
Oh.

662
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,259
干！ 這真的很好吃耶
Fuck! These are pretty good.

663
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:36,543
我們還要等多久啊
How much longer do we have to wait?

664
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,739
沒那麼快 還要等一下
A little while, just sit tight.

665
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,350
對不起
I'm sorry

666
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:44,283
我真的不知道 現在到底怎麼一回事
I don't know what's going on either.

667
00:43:45,523 --> 00:43:48,356
我不懂你為什麼把自己搞成這樣
How did you get yourself involved
in this?

668
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:50,483
我不知道 我只是想去巴黎而已
I don't know, I was just trying to
get to Paris.

669
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,057
就這樣啊
That's all.

670
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,522
但是真的有必要弄成這樣嗎？
You couldn't think of an easier way?

671
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:56,724
我那時候也覺得還好啊！
It seemed reasonable at the time.

672
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:58,193
我想也是
I'm sure it did.

673
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:00,195
現在怎麼辦？
What now?

674
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:01,565
高高怎麼辦？
What about Gao?

675
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:05,542
小凱
Kai...

676
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:20,190

681
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:56,849
糟糕
Oh shit.

682
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,666
幹嘛？
What are you doing?

683
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,469
快跳 不然會被發現
Dance or we're going to get caught!

684
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,375
快點啦 跳啊
Come on! Dance!

685
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,911
好啦
Okay.

686
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,621
不是那樣跳啦
You're doing it wrong.

687
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,457
有差嗎？        有
-Does it matter? -Yes

688
00:45:33,998 --> 00:45:34,965
往前
Forward.

689
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:37,559
你跳你的
Worry about yourself.

690
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,631
像這樣啊
Like this.

691
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:41,829
這裡
Here.

692
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,971
他去哪啊
Hey, where is he going?

693
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:58,176
應該可以走了吧
I think we can go now.

694
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,577
喔 好啊
Oh, okay.

695
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:22,166
先生 你是不是認錯人了...
Sir, I think you have the wrong person.

696
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:33,842
二伯 我要去帶客人了
Uncle, I have an apartment to show.

697
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:38,343
現在？ 三更半夜了
Now? This late?

698
00:47:38,656 --> 00:47:40,055
很難款待
It was difficult to schedule.

699
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,782
客人說現在才有空
This is the only time they
were available.

700
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:43,918
那我先去囉
I better get going!

701
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,350
快來不及了
I don't want to be late.

702
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:59,033
剛剛跳的不錯
Nice moves back there.

703
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,875
很醜吧！ 對不對？
Pretty bad right?

704
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,016
是有進步的空間啦
There's room for improvement.

705
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:12,553
現在呢？
So what now?

706
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:15,657
我也不知道
I don't know.

707
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:22,194
我不知道你為什麼那麼急著要過去
Why you need to get
over there so badly?

708
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:24,896
你不是說她在那裡等你嗎？
Didn't you say that
she's waiting for you?

709
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:28,527
嗯 對啊！ 是吧
Yeah. I guess so.

710
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:34,503
其實 她根本不知道我要過去
Actually,
she doesn't even know I'm coming.

711
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,442
你在開玩笑吧？
You're kidding, right?

712
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:41,647
我們那時候就有說好 要一起去巴黎
We talked about going to Paris together.

713
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:45,118
然後呢？
And then?

714
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:49,017
她可能覺得我留在台北比較好吧
I guess she decided I
should just stay in Taipei.

715
00:48:53,464 --> 00:48:57,366
反正 我想說不管怎樣就先過去
I thought that if I could
get over there somehow.

716
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:59,264
至少還去過了
At least I would have that.

717
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:03,969
我待在這邊我也不知道在幹什麼
I don'thave a whole lot going
for me here.

718
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:55,421
自摸
Draw!

719
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,187
莊家連一拉一紅中三花混一色
Flush! Red dragon,
three seasons, mixed suits!

720
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:58,987
十台
Wiped you out!

721
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:02,394
干！ 我們又沒有拿錢
Fuck! We're not playing for money!

722
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:05,263
我剛剛就說過啦！ 我以前照三餐打的
I told you guys...I have mahjong skills.

723
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,100
那你穿這幹嘛？
What are you wearing?

724
00:50:07,905 --> 00:50:08,872
沒啊 忘了脫了
Oh, I forgot to take it off.

725
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,735
你做這個沒出息啦
What a crappy job.

726
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:13,638
歡迎光臨 謝謝光臨
Hello and welcome, please come again.

731
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,476
那你有妹嗎？
You got a girlfriend?

732
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:24,253
記得上車前要多打幾炮啦
Better hit that while you still can!

733
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:25,948
真的
For real.

734
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,891
沒有啦 沒有什麼妹啦
No. I don't have a girlfriend.

735
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,394
但是 就有在那個啦
But I'm working on it.

736
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,462
哪個啦？
Working on what?

737
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:35,997
哪個啦？
Yeah what?

738
00:50:37,935 --> 00:50:38,959
沒有啦
Nothing.

739
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,927
那妹仔是誰啊？
Who's the girl?

740
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:43,197
同事啊
Co-worker.

741
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,898
她叫什麼名字？
What's her name?

742
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:46,898
桃子
Peach.

743
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,603
喔 桃子
Oh...Peach.

744
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:50,872
桃子
Peach.

745
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:52,845
卡哇伊吶
So cute.

746
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:53,642
對啊
Yeah.

747
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:54,876
那你什麼時候要去？
How much longer do you have?

748
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:55,712
差不多了
Not much longer.

749
00:50:55,853 --> 00:50:58,117
那她知道你要去當兵了嗎？
Does she know you're leaving?

750
00:50:58,255 --> 00:50:59,017
不知道
No.

751
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:01,215
干 女生要是聽到這個
Fuck! When she hears that...

752
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:03,087
奶罩馬上脫下來啊
Her bra will fly right off!

753
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:04,291
真的嗎？
Really?

754
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:05,690
不然你就跟她說
Just tell her...

755
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:07,057
妹仔 我去當兵了
"Girl, I'm going off to the army..."

756
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:08,255
我只是想要讓你知道
"I want you to know..."

757
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,229
我會在那裡想你
"I won't stop thinking about you".

758
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:11,293
這樣就對了
That's how it's done.

759
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:14,131
對啦 這樣講就沒有問題了
Definitely. You're in. No problem.

760
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:14,896
真的嗎？
Really?

761
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:17,438
不然你以為他怎麼每次都把得到妹？
How do you think he ever gets laid?

762
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,267
其實我根本不用當兵
Actually, I've never even been
in the army.

763
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:25,038
媽的
Damn.

764
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:26,178
打麻將啊？
Playing mahjong?

765
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:27,681
嘿 阿洪
Hey, Hong

766
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:29,979
我也要打 誰贏？
I want to play, who's winning?

767
00:51:34,892 --> 00:51:35,881
這土炮是誰？
Who's this moron?

768
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:37,960
這我們抓來的啊
We grabbed him.

769
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:39,854
東西呢？
Where's the package?

770
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:42,596
喔
Oh.

771
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:45,793
我們遇到一點狀況
We had kind of a setback.

772
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:48,162
可是在他朋友那邊
But his friend has it.

773
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:49,670
對 所以我們就想說
Right, so we were thinking...

774
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:51,899
想什麼？ 說什麼？
Who told you guys to think?

775
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:53,869
就我們先把他抓來
If we grabbed him...

776
00:51:54,011 --> 00:51:55,501
你們還在野餐啊！
What is this? A picnic?

777
00:51:59,116 --> 00:51:59,810
叫你們拿東西
I said get the package.

778
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,440
抓個土炮回來
But you bring back this moron!

779
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:09,120
我怎麼會被你們跟到啊！
I can't believe you guys are my crew.

780
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:12,393
歹勢啦 阿洪
Our bad, Hong.

781
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:13,962
對不起啦 阿洪
Yeah, sorry Hong.

782
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:15,189
對不起
Sorry, Hong.

783
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:16,822
沒關係 沒關係
It's okay, it's okay.

784
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,162
只要我們重新掌握到狀況
We'll just have to adapt
to the circumstances.

785
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:22,667
我們還是可以把事情順利完成
We can still make this
a successful score.

786
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:10,483
喂 高？
Hey, Gao?

787
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,985
喂 小凱 我是高高
Hey Kai, it's me, Gao.

788
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:13,955
我知道啊 你還好吧？
I know it's you! Are you okay?

789
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:15,155
是高高
It's Gao.

790
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,685
高高
Hey, Gao.

791
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:19,853
還好啊
Not bad.

792
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,395
你現在到底在哪裡啊？
Where are you?

793
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:24,958
喂
Hey.

794
00:53:25,102 --> 00:53:27,536
我限你三十分鐘之內 把東西交給我們
You have thirty minutes
to get me the package.

795
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:28,933
啊？
Huh?

796
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:32,906
不然你就等著去河邊撈屍體喔
Or there's going to be a dead body
at bottom of the rive

797
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:34,404
屍... 體？
Dead body?

798
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,804
那你要我怎麼做嘛？
What do you want me to do?

799
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:40,780
永福地下道 有沒有
You know the Yongfu Bridge?

800
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:41,212
嗯
Uh-huh.

801
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:43,080
河的另外一邊
On the other side of the river.

802
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,553
然後你就往前走一點
So...walk forward a little bit.

803
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:47,714
然後...
And then...

804
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:49,348
再往前走一點
Walk forward a little bit more.

805
00:53:49,493 --> 00:53:50,960
然後... 右邊
And then...on your right...

806
00:53:51,094 --> 00:53:51,890
右邊有一塊空地
There's an empty lot on the right.

807
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:53,462
你就在那邊等我們就好了
Just wait for us there.

808
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,421
好好好 我馬上過去
Okay, I'll be right there.

809
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:58,730
我警告你喔 一個人來喔！ 不要報警
I'm warning you! Come alone. No cops.

810
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:01,331
不然你就要撈屍體喔
Or there will be a dead body
in the river!

811
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,836
好好好 我知道
Okay, I understand.

812
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:04,338
你等我一下 等我一下
Just hold on, I'll be there.

813
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:13,177
先把他綁起來啊
Tie him up now please.

814
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:15,284
喔 好啊
Oh, okay.

815
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:17,320
怎麼樣了？
What?

816
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:19,012
他們要拿高高來交換
They want to exchange the package
for Gao.

817
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,356
那現在怎麼辦？
What are you going to do?

818
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:23,825
我應該要先走了
I guess I should get going.

819
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:26,219
是喔！
Really?

820
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:30,430
我就自己處理好了
I guess I should take care
of this myself.

821
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,701
你真的要一個人去喔？
You're really going alone?

822
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:38,364
大概吧
Probably.

823
00:54:44,548 --> 00:54:45,674
喂
Hey.

824
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:51,452
我在想說 兩個人一起去 會不會比較好？
I'm think it might be better
if there's two of us.

825
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:53,215
你確定要去嗎？
You sure you want to come?

826
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:54,916
可以啊
Okay.

827
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:17,445
你確定... 你Ok？
You sure you're okay?

828
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:21,082
謝謝你陪我聊那麼久
Thanks so much for listening.

829
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:24,387
跟你講話我也很開心
I'm just glad I can be here for you.

830
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:29,725
那... 就晚安囉
So...I guess this is goodnight?

831
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,150
晚安
Goodnight.

832
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:41,333
這是怎樣？
What is this?

833
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:44,199
基永 你怎麼會在這？
Ji-Yong, what are you doing here?

834
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:45,608
基永？
Ji-Yong?

835
00:55:45,876 --> 00:55:46,934
他是誰啊？
Who is he?

836
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:49,207
我不是有留紙條給你嗎？
Didn't you see the note I left?

837
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:51,814
我看啦！ 但他是誰啊？
I saw it. But who's he?

838
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,274
朋友啊
A friend.

839
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,012
嗨！ 我是Raymond
Hi, I'm Raymond.

840
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,118
朋友？        欸
-A friend? -Hey.

841
00:55:57,254 --> 00:55:58,050
對啊
That's right.

842
00:55:58,688 --> 00:55:59,382
是嗎？
Oh yeah?

843
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:01,047
你不要那麼激動
Hey, why don't you calm down?

844
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,249
我沒有激動啊
I am calm!

845
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:03,916
別這樣
Don't do that!

846
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,357
Raymond 你還好吧？
Raymond, are you okay?

847
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:07,759
我沒事 我Ok 不用擔心我
I'm okay, no need to worry.

848
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:10,129
你幹嘛推他啊？
What did you push him for?

849
00:56:10,634 --> 00:56:11,794
是他先動手的喔
He started it.

850
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:13,194
有沒有那麼嚴重啊？
I barely touched you.

851
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:15,497
我們只是聊天 沒什麼！ 就這樣而已
We were just talking, that's it.

852
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:17,163
雖然...        Raymond
-Although... -Raymond!

853
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:20,303
媛媛現在知道你不值得
Yuan finally realizes you're
not worth it

854
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:22,877
真的嗎？
Is that true?

855
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:23,877
我...
I...

856
00:56:24,014 --> 00:56:26,039
媛媛 告訴他啊
Yuan, tell him.

857
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:28,750
關你什麼事啊？
Stay out of it.

858
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:33,183
對不起啦
I'm sorry!

859
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:35,223
媛媛... 等一下
Yuan, wait...

860
00:56:37,027 --> 00:56:37,721
我已經跟你說過
I already told you.

861
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:39,488
我需要時間好好想一想
I need time to think things over.

862
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:42,726
媛媛
Yuan...

863
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,120
你手機響了
Hey, your phone's ringing.

864
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:08,925
我知道
I know.

865
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:34,316
至少我們還把高高救回來
At least I'm getting Gao back.

866
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:42,115
反正都等那麼久了
I've gotten so used to waiting.

867
00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:45,490
最慘就是繼續待在這邊
I'll just be stuck here a little longer.

868
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:52,331
我覺得待在這裡也不錯啊
Being stuck here isn't so bad.

869
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:03,209
東西呢？
Where's the package?

870
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:05,976
我朋友呢？
Where's my friend?

871
00:58:06,116 --> 00:58:07,413
東西呢？
Where's the package?

872
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:08,740
高高呢？
Where's Gao?

873
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:10,477
誰啦？
Who?

874
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,644
我朋友啊
My friend.

875
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:14,084
東西交出來喔
Hand it over.

876
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:14,747
你幹嘛？
What are you doing?

877
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:16,153
你幹嘛？ 放開她
What are you doing? Let her go!

878
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,224
你幹嘛？
Hey!

879
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:20,594
打我幹嘛？
Why did you hit me?

880
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,960
把他放開 東西拿出來啦
Leave him alone! Hand it over!

881
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:30,864
你們把東西拿出來就好啦
Just give us the package, okay?

882
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:33,234
有聽到沒？
Did you hear me?

883
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:40,109
好 你不要那麼激動啦
Okay, just take it easy.

884
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:43,246
智障
Idiot.

885
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:44,250
你打我幹什麼啦？
Why did you have to hit me?

886
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:45,411
走了啦
Let's go!

887
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,786
你有沒有怎樣？
Are you okay?

888
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:49,987
我鼻子斷了啦...
My nose is broken!

889
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:51,388
我看...
Let me see.

890
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,927
沒有斷啦
It's not broken.

891
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:55,758
可是... 等一下可能會很腫
But it will probably be swollen.

892
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,996
高高怎麼辦？ 東西又掉了
Gao's gone, the package is gone.

893
00:58:58,134 --> 00:58:59,362
完蛋了啦
I'm finished.

894
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:04,466
你要去哪？
Hey, where are you going?

895
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:06,605
等一下啦
Wait for me!

896
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:13,881
蘇西 等我一下啦
Susie, wait for me!

897
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:28,393
你幹嘛？
What are you doing?

898
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:29,555
一定有
There has to be one!

899
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:30,791
什麼？
What?

900
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,000
你看
Look!

901
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,269
這不太好吧
That's not a good idea.

902
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,175
你會不會騎太快啦？
Aren't you going a little fast?

903
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:48,010
這裡處理好 大家就爽啦！
Well done, we're all set.

904
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:49,413
妥當啦
Very good.

905
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:02,393
學長 你去哪裡啦？
Sir, where have you been?

906
01:00:06,636 --> 01:00:07,568
他在哪？
Where is he?

907
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:09,160
裡面
Inside.

908
01:00:11,508 --> 01:00:12,372
下來
Get down.

909
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:21,175
回去皇家嗎？
Back to the Palace?

910
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:22,215
嗯
Yeah.

911
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:28,515
干 超衰的
Fuck, that was lame.

912
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:29,989
真的
Seriously.

913
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:37,896
喂
Hello?

914
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:41,231
那個小凱
Hey, uh...Kai.

915
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:42,861
那邊怎麼樣 一切順利吧？
How's everything going?

916
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:44,769
豹哥 我有打給你
Brother Bao,
I've been trying to reach you!

917
01:00:44,908 --> 01:00:46,899
怎麼啦！ 那個東西拿到了嗎？
What's wrong? Did you have the package?

918
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,604
有！ 我有！ 可是有人在追我
Yeah, I did...but someone's after me!

919
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:51,407
他們還抓了我的朋友
They grabbed my friend too!

920
01:00:51,548 --> 01:00:52,515
誰？
Who?

921
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,709
我不知道啊！ 他們都穿橘色的西裝
I don't know!
They were all wearing orange suits.

922
01:00:56,352 --> 01:00:58,217
東西在不在你那嘛？
But you still have the package?

923
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,722
還在我這邊啊！
Yeah...I still have it.

924
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:03,985
可是他們...        好好好 我跟你講
-But they... -Okay, listen to me.

925
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,594
你就聽我的話 乖乖到機場
Just get yourself to the airport.

926
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:07,161
其他事我會處理 知道了嗎？
I'll take care of everything else.

927
01:01:07,297 --> 01:01:07,854
豹哥 你可能不知道
But Brother Bao, you don't understand.

928
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,487
現在狀況真的有一點亂
Things are a little messed up right now.

929
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:11,998
你就照我的話去做 不要想那麼多
Don't worry, just do what I said.

930
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:14,695
不是啦！ 豹哥        好！ 一路順風
-But Brother Bao... -Safe travels.

931
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:16,829
豹哥 等一下...
Brother Bao, wait...

932
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:18,469
怎麼啦？
What?

933
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,303
你看前面路
Hey, watch the road!

934
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:33,119
哈囉！ 您現在打的就是我阿洪的手機
Hello! You've reached Hong's cell phone.

935
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:35,190
真對不起 我現在不方便...
I'm sorry that I'm unable
to take your call...

936
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:50,668
喂 我豹哥啦！
Hey, this is Brother Bao.

937
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:53,132
你有看我那幾個孩子沒？
Have you seen my boys there tonight?

938
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:55,335
好好好
Okay.

939
01:01:57,146 --> 01:01:57,908
安怎？
What?

940
01:01:58,715 --> 01:01:59,704
走
Let's go!

941
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:04,784
走了 走了
Let's go, let's go.

942
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:09,313
不好意思 老闆娘
Excuse me, ma'am.

943
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:11,620
你剛才有看到幾個人走進來嗎？
Did you just see someone run in here?

944
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:14,687
休息三百
Quicky? Three hundred.

945
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:19,060
沒有要那個啦
Oh, we're not, uh...

946
01:02:21,371 --> 01:02:23,202
若是要過夜八百
Eight hundred for the night.

947
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:24,834
好 謝謝
Okay, thanks.

948
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,338
那她知道你喜歡她嗎？
Does she know that you like her?

949
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:33,608
不知道
No.

950
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:35,473
為什麼？
Why not?

951
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:41,087
因為... 每次看到她我就很緊張
Because I get so nervous around her.

952
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:43,490
那你真的很喜歡她
So you must really like her.

953
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:44,884
嗯
Yeah.

954
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:48,720
那你要不要跟她說你很喜歡她
So why don't you tell her that you
like her?

955
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,725
嗯
Oh.

956
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,528
我有想過啦
I've thought about it.

957
01:02:58,374 --> 01:03:01,207
我覺得喜歡一個人 是一件很美好的事情
I think being in love is
a beautiful thing.

958
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:02,869
要勇敢一點
But you have to be brave.

959
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:05,480
要抱著被拒絕的心態
And be prepared for rejection.

960
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:08,841
像個男人一樣
Like a man.

961
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:10,942
嗯
Oh.

962
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:16,390
嘿 阿洪
Hey, Hong.

963
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:18,425
拿到了嗎？
Did you get it?

964
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:20,119
拿到了
We got it.

965
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:25,232
阿洪 那我們先走囉
We're leaving now, Hong.

966
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:26,827
等一下 等一下
Hold on, hold on.

967
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:29,801
雖然這一次出了一點小狀況
Despite a few minor setbacks

968
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:31,531
我承認是我交代不夠清楚
And a little miscommunication
on my part.

969
01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:33,933
但是我們這一票 真的做得非常漂亮
We still managed to make a sweet score.

970
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:35,574
很好 很好
Excellent.

971
01:03:51,461 --> 01:03:52,723
嗯...
Oh...

972
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:57,028
阿洪 你真的已經很努力的啦
It was a good try, Hong.

973
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:58,428
嘿
Right.

974
01:03:58,568 --> 01:03:59,626
你還是我們的阿洪
You're still our Hong.

975
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:00,394
對啊
Yeah.

976
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:02,401
你們三個土炮要去哪裡啊？
Where are you three morons going?

977
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:04,062
這事情沒意思啊
There's no point anymore.

978
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:07,502
對啦 這東西還給你啦
Oh yeah, you can have this back.

979
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:10,206
歹勢 阿洪
Sorry, Hong.

980
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,879
歹勢啦 阿洪

981
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:18,185
看什麼看？
What are you looking at?

982
01:04:41,511 --> 01:04:42,535
好險喔
Close call.

983
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:07,893
有沒有？
Hear anything?

984
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,238
應該不是這間
It's probably not this one.

985
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:17,242
你小心一點
Hey, be careful.

986
01:05:30,359 --> 01:05:31,986
你這裡等一下 我上去一下
Wait for me here.

987
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:46,432
賣面的
Hey, noodle boy.

988
01:05:46,576 --> 01:05:47,975
這怎麼回事？
What is this?

989
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:52,004
豹哥給你這個幹什麼？
Why did Brother Bao give this to you?

990
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:54,448
我不知道啊
I don't know.

991
01:05:54,584 --> 01:05:55,846
他不知道
He doesn't know.

992
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,446
是有人叫他幫忙帶去巴黎
Someone told him to bring it to Paris.

993
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:00,079
巴黎...？
Paris?

994
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:03,058
會不會痛？
Did that hurt?

995
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:04,390
不痛
No.

996
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:07,794
怎麼可能...
I don't believe it.

997
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:12,992
一定有
There has to be something.

998
01:06:13,503 --> 01:06:15,232
你幹嘛？
What are you doing?

999
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:16,395
不要吵
Shut up.

1000
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,673
欸 你幹嘛
Hey, what are you doing?

1001
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:21,240
就不相信
Come on.

1002
01:06:22,345 --> 01:06:23,607
在哪裡？
Where is it?

1003
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:28,076
法文課？ 什麼啊？
French lessons? What the hell?

1004
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:33,553
沒道理啊
It makes no sense.

1005
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:38,188
豹哥把他的照片給你
Brother Bao gave you his photo.

1006
01:06:38,795 --> 01:06:40,057
叫你帶去巴黎
To take to Paris...

1007
01:06:42,231 --> 01:06:43,027
那是豹哥？
That's Brother Bao?

1008
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:44,292
你不要講話
Please be quiet.

1009
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:49,771
你還是乖乖的告訴我 到底發生什麼事？
So tell me again what's really going on?

1010
01:06:49,906 --> 01:06:51,635
我不知道啦 真的啦
I don't know. Really.

1011
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:53,740
阿洪
Hong.

1012
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:54,934
二伯
Uncle.

1013
01:06:55,278 --> 01:06:57,269
你這孩子到底是在想什麼？
What's wrong with you kids?

1014
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:00,949
怎麼講的話都不要聽
You don't listen to anything I say.

1015
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:03,107
小凱
Kai

1016
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:05,447
你不是乖乖的應該去機場了嗎？
Shouldn't you be on your way
to the airport?

1017
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:06,919
你可以去巴黎啦
You can go to Paris now.

1018
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:08,983
那是因為...
It's cause...

1019
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:11,356
喔...
Oh...

1020
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:13,359
你幹的好事啊
Nicely done!

1021
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:17,160
二伯 我只是想說...
Uncle, I was just...

1022
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,858
先干條大的 對吧
You wanted a big score, huh?

1023
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:20,826
我告訴你 這麼重要的事情
You think I'd hand over
anything important

1024
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,460
會交給這種菜烏嗎？
To this dipshit?

1025
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:25,073
真正的貨我早就處理好了
I already took care of the real package.

1026
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:30,877
警察！ 別動
Police! Freeze!

1027
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:35,981
