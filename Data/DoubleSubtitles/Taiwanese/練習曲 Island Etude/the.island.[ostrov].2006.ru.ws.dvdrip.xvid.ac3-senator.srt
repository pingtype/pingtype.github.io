have mercy on me, a sinner.

O Lord Jesus Christ Son of God,

have mercy on me, a sinner.

There's nobody here.
What now?

23
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,412
Don't shoot!

24
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,951
Don't shoot!
I... I give myself up.

25
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:22,423
Don't shoot!

26
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:38,806
Where's your Captain?

27
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:41,175
What?

28
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,545
Where's your Captain?

29
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,082
Nicht verstehen! [Don't understand!]
I don't understand.

30
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:57,992
Don't!
...I understand...

31
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,828
He's here.

32
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,230
Don't beat me.

33
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:06,233
I'll show you where.

34
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:08,535
He's here.

35
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:10,804
Right here.

36
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,274
Hey, Tikhon!

37
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,809
Tikhon, get out!

38
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,479
Get out, now!

39
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,080
That's him.

40
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:34,728
- How long?
- 20 minutes.

41
00:06:38,032 --> 00:06:39,867
You are useless. Shoot!

42
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:42,836
- Aim!
- No!

43
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,673
Don't shoot me, please!

44
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,042
Don't shoot me.

45
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,046
Don't shoot me!

46
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,316
Please! Don't shoot me.

47
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,841
Kill him. Be a man.

48
00:07:21,342 --> 00:07:22,743
What d'ya want?

49
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,947
Be a man.

50
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,684
I can't.

51
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,593
I won't.

52
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:02,276
Didn't make it, did ya?
But I did. Yes.

53
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,145
Bastards, you killed Tikhon!

Monastery, 1976

55
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:45,566
Father, where is Father Anatoli?

56
00:12:47,268 --> 00:12:48,869
Sleeping.

57
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:51,605
We've been waiting a long time.
Why is he sleeping?

58
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:53,274
I see. He's sleeping.

59
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,242
How long do we wait?
We are tired.

60
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:59,013
Wait a little.
He'll come out before long.

61
00:14:08,616 --> 00:14:10,951
I'd like to talk
to holy man Anatoli.

62
00:14:12,253 --> 00:14:14,154
What?

63
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:17,024
There'll be more sense
if you listen to the radio.

64
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:24,531
Are you in trouble?

65
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:26,433
Yes.

66
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,569
Big trouble.

67
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:31,505
Don't cry. I'll ask him.

68
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:35,276
Perhaps he'll deign...

69
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,979
But then he's been
in the sulks today.

70
00:14:41,282 --> 00:14:44,618
I'll not be in your debt.

71
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:46,353
Put that away, you fool.

72
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:49,123
Don't let me see it again.

73
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:50,624
Sorry.

74
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:32,433
Well then...

75
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:36,503
You want a blessing for murder?

76
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:42,142
Take this for a blessing.

77
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:43,844
Please, Father,

78
00:15:44,345 --> 00:15:47,548
ask the blessing for an abortion

79
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:49,550
from the holy man.

80
00:15:52,253 --> 00:15:55,789
You are heading for hell
and want to drag me too?

81
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:02,496
I know

82
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,200
if I have a baby

83
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,569
no one's gonna marry me.

84
00:16:09,103 --> 00:16:10,971
Who'll want me with a baby?

85
00:16:11,672 --> 00:16:13,807
No one'll want you without it.

86
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,810
It was preordained.

87
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,782
You'll have a baby...

88
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:23,550
for comfort.

89
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,588
Or you'll be cursing yourself
all your life

90
00:16:29,123 --> 00:16:31,325
that you killed an innocent child.

91
00:16:32,893 --> 00:16:35,596
How do you know?
You are not a holy man.

92
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:39,166
Maybe I too...

93
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,402
killed a man.

94
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:47,207
Anyway, don't kneel before me.

95
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:52,479
Fall to your knees
when you pray to God.

96
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:59,920
You'll have a boy.

97
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:03,257
A golden boy.

98
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,464
Now get off my island!

99
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:28,869
O Lord, have mercy...

100
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,172
Glory be to Thee, O Lord

101
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:42,476
Glory be to Thee.

102
00:20:50,718 --> 00:20:52,453
Glory be to the Father,
and to the Son,

103
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:54,955
and to the Holy Ghost,
for ever and ever. Amen.

104
00:20:57,524 --> 00:20:59,326
Blessed be God

105
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:03,197
For ever and ever. Amen.

106
00:21:03,664 --> 00:21:05,899
Glory be to Thee, O Lord

107
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,335
Glory be to Thee.

108
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:11,238
Glory to the Father,
and to the Son...

109
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:14,508
O all-holy Trinity,
have mercy upon us.

110
00:21:14,575 --> 00:21:17,211
O Lord, wash away our sins...

111
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:19,747
Remember, O Lord,

112
00:21:20,114 --> 00:21:22,416
the soul of thy departed servant,

113
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,885
the warrior Tikhon.

114
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,256
Pardon him every sin

115
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,659
and grant him the Kingdom of Heaven

116
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:34,128
and the Fount of everlasting Life.

117
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:51,879
O Lord Jesus Christ

118
00:21:52,313 --> 00:21:53,514
Son of God,

119
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:55,983
have mercy on this sinner.

120
00:22:16,303 --> 00:22:18,405
O Lord, forsake me not...

121
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,942
Forsake me not, help me, O Lord.

122
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,546
Deliver my soul from the dungeon,
O Lord

123
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:30,217
forsake me not.

124
00:22:31,085 --> 00:22:32,920
Have mercy upon me, O Lord,

125
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,362
blot out my transgressions.

126
00:22:44,965 --> 00:22:48,535
For I acknowledge my iniquity
and my sin is ever before me.

127
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,418
Wash me and I shall be whiter
than snow,

128
00:23:05,586 --> 00:23:08,155
make me hear joy and gladness,

129
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:14,361
wash me from my iniquity

130
00:23:15,129 --> 00:23:17,164
and cleanse me from my sin.

131
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:20,000
Create in me a clean heart,

132
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:28,042
Cast me not away

133
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:31,612
from Thy presence.

134
00:26:41,702 --> 00:26:43,537
Harken the prayers of our Holy Fathers,

135
00:26:43,871 --> 00:26:46,273
O Lord Jesus Christ our God,

136
00:26:46,807 --> 00:26:48,175
have mercy on us.

137
00:26:53,347 --> 00:26:55,616
Hey, Father Anatoli,

138
00:26:57,451 --> 00:26:59,453
somebody has soiled the handle.

139
00:27:00,421 --> 00:27:03,457
Who could it be?
Must be some mean souls.

140
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:06,260
- Wipe it.
- In a minute.

141
00:27:07,328 --> 00:27:09,430
Give me a rag to wipe my hand.

142
00:27:10,598 --> 00:27:11,865
I got none.

143
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:14,468
Don't I give you rags
for your needs?

144
00:27:14,835 --> 00:27:18,439
No rags really.
Go inside, have a look.

145
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:20,874
That is, if you don't mind
the soot, filth, coal.

146
00:27:21,342 --> 00:27:23,477
No matter.

147
00:27:24,678 --> 00:27:26,413
I'm here on behalf

148
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,315
of our Father Superior, Filaret.

149
00:27:28,616 --> 00:27:31,685
Get Father Filaret's blessing
and live in peace with him.

150
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:33,621
Live with a saint you'll become a saint.

151
00:27:34,922 --> 00:27:37,524
You said something
and I didn't get it.

152
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:41,428
Father Filaret shows his kindness.

153
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:45,399
He wants you to live in his chamber
to mend your health.

154
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:48,235
Who's going to work here?

155
00:27:48,535 --> 00:27:50,971
Lay brother Nicodemus.

156
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,842
Why, he dreads fire.

157
00:27:55,643 --> 00:27:57,678
We all dread Gehenna.

158
00:27:59,713 --> 00:28:01,482
Father Job,

159
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:03,784
bless me to stay here.

160
00:28:04,318 --> 00:28:05,953
I'm used to it, I know all about it.

161
00:28:06,453 --> 00:28:08,856
It's winter. I need to stoke up.

162
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:10,858
Do you hear me?

163
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:13,427
Father Filaret is showing
you kindness!

164
00:28:15,896 --> 00:28:19,500
Look, you learned to read and write,
didn't you?

165
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:24,705
If I didn't I wouldn't be a chief.

166
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:27,408
Read holy books too.

167
00:28:27,942 --> 00:28:29,977
Sure, I know many by heart.

168
00:28:34,848 --> 00:28:36,850
I forget

169
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:40,921
why Cain

170
00:28:41,655 --> 00:28:43,824
killed his brother Abel.

171
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:48,929
You and your jokes.
You'd better wipe that handle.

172
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:52,333
You're wallowing in filth,

173
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,835
joker.

174
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:09,009
It's sheer bliss...

175
00:30:09,443 --> 00:30:11,278
You are always scaring me!

176
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:14,315
Where did you learn to walk
noiselessly?

177
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:18,152
If you like,
I can make me horseshoes

178
00:30:18,452 --> 00:30:20,788
so I'm always heard from a distance.

179
00:30:21,288 --> 00:30:22,489
Just you dare!

180
00:30:23,223 --> 00:30:24,692
This is a monastery, not stables.

181
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:28,229
If everybody wears horseshoes
there'll be such noise!

182
00:30:28,762 --> 00:30:30,264
Like at a hippodrome.

183
00:30:35,102 --> 00:30:38,472
Should I make bets on you?
What now?

184
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:45,746
Let me report...

185
00:30:47,281 --> 00:30:48,582
Father Anatoli...

186
00:30:50,251 --> 00:30:51,619
Father Anatoli? Not again!

187
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:54,054
What has he done wrong?

188
00:30:57,891 --> 00:30:59,860
It's all written here.

189
00:30:59,927 --> 00:31:03,597
What do I want with your scrawl?
Say what you have to say.

190
00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:07,134
And let's have done with this.

191
00:31:07,668 --> 00:31:09,436
This is what in all honesty

192
00:31:09,837 --> 00:31:11,672
can no longer be tolerated.

193
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:16,377
Firstly, Anatoli never washes
his face and hands.

194
00:31:17,177 --> 00:31:19,346
Second, he is always late for work.

195
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,816
Third, Mainland folk are
always coming to see him.

196
00:31:23,284 --> 00:31:26,654
Yesterday he showed up
in church

197
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,856
with a felt boot on one leg
and a sock on the other

198
00:31:28,923 --> 00:31:30,791
and started singing
through his nose.

199
00:31:31,358 --> 00:31:32,560
Father,

200
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:34,862
the brethren are grumbling.

201
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:40,100
On festive occasions
he does come to church

202
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:42,503
but he doesn't pray,
only exposes...

203
00:31:42,836 --> 00:31:45,539
He was barred from refectory.

204
00:31:45,873 --> 00:31:48,709
Enough. My head is spinning already.

205
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:51,378
Where is he now?

206
00:31:52,546 --> 00:31:53,847
Where else?

207
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,319
In the boiler room

208
00:31:59,587 --> 00:32:01,488
having tea with laymen.

209
00:32:03,357 --> 00:32:04,558
With sugar!

210
00:32:07,294 --> 00:32:09,730
- Shall I call him?
- No, I'll see him.

211
00:32:10,364 --> 00:32:14,168
Did you tell him to quit his work
in the boiler room

212
00:32:14,468 --> 00:32:16,570
and move to my cell?

213
00:32:16,904 --> 00:32:18,372
- I did.
- And?

214
00:32:19,907 --> 00:32:21,575
He asked me

215
00:32:23,811 --> 00:32:25,179
if I know

216
00:32:26,247 --> 00:32:28,215
why Cain killed Abel.

217
00:32:30,217 --> 00:32:31,418
Why indeed?

218
00:32:33,754 --> 00:32:35,456
Are you trying to hurt me?

219
00:32:35,823 --> 00:32:38,592
Sorry. You can go.
I'll sort it out with him.

220
00:32:38,993 --> 00:32:40,628
I mean well...

221
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:42,796
Go, my good man, go.

222
00:32:42,997 --> 00:32:44,365
And forgive me.

223
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:49,770
O Mother of God,

224
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:54,875
forgive this sinner,
save and keep me.

225
00:32:55,876 --> 00:32:58,512
Give me and my brethren
health and strength.

226
00:32:59,213 --> 00:33:01,649
May this day be joyful
and free of sin.

227
00:33:04,385 --> 00:33:06,754
Forgive me,
Mother of God.

228
00:33:07,221 --> 00:33:10,457
Preserve my faith

229
00:33:10,858 --> 00:33:13,928
and multiply my love for Thee.

230
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:15,963
With my whole heart
have I sought thee, O Lord.

231
00:33:16,497 --> 00:33:19,266
O Lord, grant remission
of their sins

232
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,736
unto all who have fallen asleep

233
00:33:23,571 --> 00:33:25,439
in faith and the hope
of resurrection...

234
00:34:36,877 --> 00:34:38,078
Father!

235
00:34:38,812 --> 00:34:40,014
Take this. All homemade.

236
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:43,984
Please pray for my late husband.

237
00:34:45,052 --> 00:34:48,355
He was killed
in the Great Patriotic War.

238
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,395
Have a seat, sister.
Let's have tea.

239
00:34:55,396 --> 00:34:56,597
Sit down.

240
00:35:01,535 --> 00:35:02,736
Now tell me your story.

241
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:12,012
He keeps coming to me in my sleep.

242
00:35:14,348 --> 00:35:16,951
- What does he say?
- Nothing.

243
00:35:18,385 --> 00:35:19,954
He just groans.

244
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,992
He must be feeling bad up there.

245
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:37,905
- Did you love him?
- I still do.

246
00:35:39,974 --> 00:35:42,543
We'd been together only six months.

247
00:35:43,611 --> 00:35:45,045
Then he was recruited.

248
00:35:46,113 --> 00:35:48,983
I've been widowed for 30 years now.

249
00:35:54,521 --> 00:35:55,723
Very well.

250
00:35:56,156 --> 00:35:59,159
Given such love,
it'll do no harm to ask.

251
00:36:01,395 --> 00:36:04,164
I'll go see Father Anatoli.

252
00:36:05,132 --> 00:36:07,167
He is not a saint but well-read.

253
00:36:07,701 --> 00:36:09,937
He may give some useful advice.

254
00:36:12,506 --> 00:36:13,841
Come over here.

255
00:36:18,479 --> 00:36:20,514
While I'm talking to him -

256
00:36:20,981 --> 00:36:23,918
I'll open the door -
you stand here and listen.

257
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:25,920
Just be quiet.

258
00:36:33,027 --> 00:36:34,762
- What's his name?
- Mikhail.

259
00:36:44,572 --> 00:36:46,707
Father Anatoli,

260
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:49,743
a widow here asks you to pray

261
00:36:50,077 --> 00:36:53,213
for the repose of
a fallen warrior Mikhail.

262
00:36:55,983 --> 00:36:57,184
What an idea!

263
00:36:57,651 --> 00:37:00,521
A requiem for the living!

264
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:03,090
How come?

265
00:37:03,557 --> 00:37:07,094
She says he laid down his life
in battle in '44.

266
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,833
He laid down nothing.
He was captured.

267
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:17,705
After Victory
he stayed in France.

268
00:37:18,205 --> 00:37:22,209
He's ailing now.
Wants to see his first,

269
00:37:22,943 --> 00:37:25,045
beloved wife before he dies.

270
00:37:25,779 --> 00:37:27,781
What are you doing here? Go away.

271
00:37:39,026 --> 00:37:40,561
Did you hear?

272
00:37:40,961 --> 00:37:44,031
No requiem for the living, he says.

273
00:37:45,032 --> 00:37:47,935
Your man is alive but ailing.

274
00:37:49,169 --> 00:37:51,038
You gotta go to France.

275
00:37:51,572 --> 00:37:53,607
To comfort the ailing man
before he dies

276
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:56,110
and close his eyes.

277
00:37:58,078 --> 00:38:00,281
Don't stare at me, do it.

278
00:38:04,218 --> 00:38:05,920
What are you saying, Father?

279
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:07,988
Me? To France?

280
00:38:09,056 --> 00:38:12,259
Why not? People live in France too.

281
00:38:14,261 --> 00:38:15,763
Impossible.

282
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:18,699
It's a capitalist country.
They won't let me out.

283
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:21,969
Have no fear.
If Father Anatoli says so,

284
00:38:22,303 --> 00:38:23,871
they will.

285
00:38:24,738 --> 00:38:27,641
But there's my household, my cow...

286
00:38:27,942 --> 00:38:29,276
My pig needs to be slaughtered.

287
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:32,079
Sell it all, lock, stock and barrel.

288
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:34,281
- All?
- Lock, stock and barrel.

289
00:38:42,923 --> 00:38:44,758
Sell it. You won't be sorry.

290
00:38:45,259 --> 00:38:48,529
They'll give a lot of money
for your pig.

291
00:38:49,096 --> 00:38:50,297
It's a good pig.

292
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:53,067
If I ate meat

293
00:38:53,701 --> 00:38:55,836
I'd buy it.

294
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,072
I would.

295
00:38:58,572 --> 00:39:00,774
You must be joking, Father.

296
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:03,811
Do you love your husband?

297
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:07,882
Then go and do
what was preordained.

298
00:39:11,151 --> 00:39:14,121
Don't upset me, go!

299
00:39:42,383 --> 00:39:46,186
Forgive me and have mercy!

300
00:39:47,655 --> 00:39:51,258
Direct me on my way, O Lord!

301
00:40:10,044 --> 00:40:12,379
For I am weak in soul.

302
00:40:13,013 --> 00:40:14,882
And weak in body - yea!

303
00:40:15,816 --> 00:40:20,020
And of sinful passions
Am I a vicious slave.

304
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:32,066
Can't you adjust the prop?

305
00:40:32,366 --> 00:40:35,769
Your laundry's on the ground.

306
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:39,006
Not too many of you today.

307
00:40:47,414 --> 00:40:49,049
What are you doing here?

308
00:40:49,483 --> 00:40:51,919
Writing a petition
to our Heavenly King...

309
00:40:52,453 --> 00:40:54,989
...to survive the winter.

310
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:58,425
It's hard for brethren to cut
a grave through permafrost.

311
00:40:59,093 --> 00:41:01,996
Thank God you're joking again,
I feared you'd gone mad.

312
00:41:07,134 --> 00:41:08,903
Look, it's sailing.

313
00:41:14,108 --> 00:41:16,343
Pray for me, Father Anatoli.

314
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:24,485
You should pray for me.
I'm three times as sinful as you.

315
00:41:25,185 --> 00:41:26,554
What are you saying?

316
00:41:30,524 --> 00:41:32,393
You don't like me, Father Job.

317
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:37,197
Filaret does, and you--

318
00:41:38,432 --> 00:41:40,200
are trying to please him.

319
00:41:42,937 --> 00:41:44,538
Why should I love you?

320
00:41:44,939 --> 00:41:47,041
You never pass my cell
without a prank.

321
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:50,144
Now you soil the door handle,
now you plant some trash.

322
00:41:50,444 --> 00:41:54,448
Don't I know about my sins
without your hints?

323
00:42:01,522 --> 00:42:02,890
Okay...

324
00:42:03,424 --> 00:42:04,625
Forget it, brother.

325
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:07,962
And forgive this sinner.

326
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:13,160
- Tired?
- No, no.

327
00:43:13,494 --> 00:43:15,095
Fine.

328
00:43:19,466 --> 00:43:22,069
- Let me carry you.
- No, I can manage.

329
00:43:25,673 --> 00:43:27,975
- Careful.
- I can do it.

330
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:29,510
Yes, of course.

331
00:43:31,078 --> 00:43:32,279
Careful.

332
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,054
Mind his leg!

333
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:24,965
He fell from a shed roof.

334
00:44:25,566 --> 00:44:28,102
Broke his leg.
His hip is rotting now.

335
00:44:30,704 --> 00:44:34,041
Four operations, but it didn't help.

336
00:44:35,009 --> 00:44:37,745
We've seen all sorts of professors
and surgeons...

337
00:44:39,713 --> 00:44:41,248
I'm hot, Mom.

338
00:44:41,749 --> 00:44:43,684
The Father will help us.

339
00:44:47,321 --> 00:44:49,590
No one is able to help
and his hip is rotting.

340
00:44:49,957 --> 00:44:52,293
Sit down. You are tired.

341
00:44:57,131 --> 00:44:59,233
- What's the boy's name?
- Vanechka.

342
00:45:03,237 --> 00:45:05,105
This good man will help us.

343
00:45:18,652 --> 00:45:20,821
Let's take the crutches away.

344
00:45:27,228 --> 00:45:28,596
Get up,

345
00:45:29,196 --> 00:45:31,765
I'll move the block a little.

346
00:45:39,073 --> 00:45:40,674
Put him on the block.

347
00:45:43,711 --> 00:45:45,746
- Don't be afraid.
- Won't it hurt him?

348
00:45:46,647 --> 00:45:48,148
Hold him.

349
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:53,821
My angel...

350
00:45:54,855 --> 00:45:56,056
Vanechka,

351
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:59,193
I'm going to pray to God.

352
00:46:00,928 --> 00:46:02,863
You pray too,

353
00:46:03,664 --> 00:46:05,065
in your own words.

354
00:46:05,366 --> 00:46:07,268
Ask the Lord to heal your leg.

355
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:09,803
He's kind,

356
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:13,707
He'll help.

357
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:16,010
He will.

358
00:46:17,077 --> 00:46:18,846
My dearest...

359
00:46:19,947 --> 00:46:21,415
Just stand still.

360
00:46:34,795 --> 00:46:37,898
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

361
00:46:40,401 --> 00:46:42,469
Glory be to you, O Lord.

362
00:46:45,973 --> 00:46:48,442
O Heavenly King, Comforter,
and Spirit of Truth,

363
00:46:51,745 --> 00:46:54,315
Come and take up
Your abode in us,

364
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:57,451
and cleanse us from every stain,

365
00:46:58,018 --> 00:47:00,054
and save our souls.

366
00:47:00,387 --> 00:47:02,356
Ask the Lord.

367
00:47:03,357 --> 00:47:05,926
Yes, ask Him, my love.

368
00:47:08,062 --> 00:47:10,264
Please help me

369
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:13,734
and heal my leg.

370
00:47:14,802 --> 00:47:16,904
My dear boy...

371
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:38,025
We are praying to You, our God.

372
00:47:38,359 --> 00:47:40,494
Visit Your grace on

373
00:47:41,028 --> 00:47:42,796
Your servant John,

374
00:47:43,097 --> 00:47:46,200
forgive him all transgressions

375
00:47:46,967 --> 00:47:49,203
Send down Your healing strength

376
00:47:49,803 --> 00:47:52,540
On his flesh.

377
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,911
Put the fire out, quench all heat
And creeping illness.

378
00:47:58,078 --> 00:47:59,847
Heal Thy servant John.

379
00:48:00,781 --> 00:48:03,017
Please, O dear God!

380
00:48:03,317 --> 00:48:04,919
Raise him from his sick bed,

381
00:48:07,588 --> 00:48:09,089
Bring him to Thy Church

382
00:48:09,456 --> 00:48:12,226
That he may understand Thy will

383
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,996
Glory be

384
00:48:16,797 --> 00:48:18,165
to the Father,

385
00:48:18,966 --> 00:48:20,801
and to the Son,
and to the Holy Ghost,

386
00:48:21,468 --> 00:48:25,206
For ever and ever,

387
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:40,154
Glory be to Thee, O Lord.

388
00:48:41,155 --> 00:48:44,858
O Lord, succor John,

389
00:48:46,493 --> 00:48:49,029
heal his leg.

390
00:48:51,932 --> 00:48:54,835
God Almighty, succor
the suffering and the sick.

391
00:48:59,173 --> 00:49:01,475
I trust in Thee, O Lord.

392
00:49:19,159 --> 00:49:21,395
Now you'll be all right, Vanechka.

393
00:49:22,229 --> 00:49:24,365
Come on, have a go.

394
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:27,167
No, he can't.

395
00:49:27,501 --> 00:49:29,303
Yes, he can.

396
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:31,372
- Try it.
- Careful.

397
00:49:31,972 --> 00:49:33,574
Hold it, hold it.

398
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:35,643
Look, he's walking.

399
00:49:37,545 --> 00:49:38,913
Good boy.

400
00:49:42,082 --> 00:49:46,186
You won't need
the crutches anymore.

401
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:48,956
Forget about them.

402
00:49:51,125 --> 00:49:53,427
Come over to me, angel.

403
00:49:54,995 --> 00:49:57,231
My boy, my golden boy.

404
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,435
- We'll be going now, and thanks.
- Going?

405
00:50:02,903 --> 00:50:05,539
You should stay the night
at the monastery.

406
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:07,875
Tomorrow Father Filaret

407
00:50:08,242 --> 00:50:10,010
will give your boy communion

408
00:50:10,344 --> 00:50:12,012
and he'll never limp again.

409
00:50:12,413 --> 00:50:14,014
I can't stay.

410
00:50:15,049 --> 00:50:16,483
I need to go to work.

411
00:50:17,551 --> 00:50:20,621
D'ya think I'm playing games
with you?

412
00:50:22,122 --> 00:50:24,225
I've got a ticket.

413
00:50:26,327 --> 00:50:27,528
What's more important,

414
00:50:29,063 --> 00:50:30,664
your son or your work?

415
00:50:31,232 --> 00:50:34,001
But I got to go to work.

416
00:50:36,203 --> 00:50:38,539
Get out of my sight.

417
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:40,241
Leave!

418
00:51:02,296 --> 00:51:03,497
Wait!

419
00:51:04,164 --> 00:51:06,300
Come back!

420
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:09,270
Go ashore!

421
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:22,116
What do you think you are doing?

422
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,485
There, my boy.

423
00:51:25,252 --> 00:51:27,521
- What are you up to?
- If you don't think about yourself,

424
00:51:27,588 --> 00:51:30,157
think about your boy.
He'll be a cripple for life.

425
00:51:30,224 --> 00:51:31,692
- Let him be.
- You're stupid.

426
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:33,961
Let him be.

427
00:51:38,299 --> 00:51:39,500
Vanya!

428
00:51:40,634 --> 00:51:43,304
Come, Vanya, have no fear.

429
00:51:48,275 --> 00:51:50,244
I'll be fired.

430
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:52,646
You like your work?

431
00:51:53,113 --> 00:51:55,382
I love it.

432
00:51:56,116 --> 00:51:58,152
Our design bureau
is commissioning a project

433
00:51:58,452 --> 00:52:00,321
and we even work overnight.

434
00:52:00,721 --> 00:52:02,523
A pipe's broken there

435
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:06,994
and the staff's on three days' leave
without pay.

436
00:52:07,294 --> 00:52:09,997
How can you know?
Why are you lying?

437
00:52:10,331 --> 00:52:13,334
I am not lying. When you find out
it'll be too late.

438
00:52:13,701 --> 00:52:15,436
Go, woman. I have no time for you.

439
00:52:16,203 --> 00:52:17,571
Another row?

440
00:52:18,038 --> 00:52:20,207
Look... take the boy,

441
00:52:22,142 --> 00:52:23,777
settle him for the night.

442
00:52:24,612 --> 00:52:27,181
Tomorrow Father Filaret

443
00:52:27,514 --> 00:52:29,316
will give him communion.

444
00:52:30,084 --> 00:52:31,685
Whose boy is he?

445
00:52:34,521 --> 00:52:36,290
What do we do now?

446
00:52:38,158 --> 00:52:39,460
- ls he your boy?
- Yes.

447
00:52:40,194 --> 00:52:41,729
Where do we go now?

448
00:52:46,367 --> 00:52:48,402
Come with me.

449
00:53:47,828 --> 00:53:49,196
Blessed is the man

450
00:53:49,897 --> 00:53:52,499
that walks not in the counsel
of the ungodly,

451
00:53:53,534 --> 00:53:55,569
nor stands in the way of sinners,

452
00:53:57,338 --> 00:53:59,440
nor sits in the seat
of the scornful:

453
00:54:00,608 --> 00:54:03,110
but whose delight is
in the Will of the Lord;

454
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:13,387
And he shall be like a tree planted
by the fount of eternal life

455
00:54:15,823 --> 00:54:18,525
that brings forth fruit
in season;

456
00:54:20,227 --> 00:54:21,862
And whose leaf shall not wither;

457
00:54:22,563 --> 00:54:25,432
whatsoever he does
shall prosper.

458
00:54:28,335 --> 00:54:31,338
Not so are the ungodly;
They are like chaff

459
00:54:32,973 --> 00:54:35,643
Blown by the wind.

460
00:54:36,243 --> 00:54:37,444
Therefore

461
00:54:38,512 --> 00:54:40,781
the ungodly shall not stand
in the judgment,

462
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:44,351
nor sinners in
the council of the righteous.

463
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:48,188
For the Lord knows
the way of the righteous:

464
00:54:49,423 --> 00:54:52,159
but the way of the ungodly
leads nowhere.

465
00:55:37,304 --> 00:55:38,572
What are you doing there?

466
00:55:39,373 --> 00:55:40,574
Lying in wait for you.

467
00:55:44,612 --> 00:55:46,614
Why the charred log?

468
00:55:47,281 --> 00:55:51,018
It just leaped out of my hands.
I didn't mean it.

469
00:55:51,752 --> 00:55:52,987
I see.

470
00:55:53,621 --> 00:55:56,590
- No, you don't.
- Come down.

471
00:55:58,492 --> 00:56:00,394
No, I'm fine where I am.

472
00:56:00,728 --> 00:56:02,329
I've got complaints about you.

473
00:56:04,865 --> 00:56:06,534
The proud are risen against me

474
00:56:06,934 --> 00:56:08,836
and violent men have sought
my soul.

475
00:56:10,771 --> 00:56:13,641
What do you think I should do
about this, prankster?

476
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:17,678
Marvelous are your deeds,
O Lord!

477
00:56:19,413 --> 00:56:21,882
I hear you are
cultivating superstitions

478
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,618
and tempting brethren
and laymen.

479
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:27,788
Safeguard me from worldly slander...

480
00:56:28,956 --> 00:56:30,858
Forget prayers and
use your brains.

481
00:56:31,325 --> 00:56:33,894
Being your superior
I am duty-bound to punish you.

482
00:56:35,029 --> 00:56:37,031
The Lord is my light.

483
00:56:37,932 --> 00:56:39,967
Whom shall I fear?

484
00:56:41,068 --> 00:56:42,636
Just you wait, prankster.

485
00:56:43,571 --> 00:56:45,940
You'll reap the benefits
of your doings.

486
00:56:48,609 --> 00:56:49,910
In God is my salvation

487
00:56:50,578 --> 00:56:52,880
and my comfort.

488
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:58,085
Forgive me

489
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:00,287
and have mercy!

490
00:57:01,422 --> 00:57:03,457
Direct me on Thy way,

491
00:57:03,791 --> 00:57:05,492
O Lord!

492
00:57:06,594 --> 00:57:08,863
For my soul is weak

493
00:57:10,064 --> 00:57:11,665
And so is my body

494
00:57:12,633 --> 00:57:16,370
And of sinful passions
Am I a vicious slave.

495
00:58:33,914 --> 00:58:36,617
Father Anatoli is looking
the wrong way.

496
00:58:36,984 --> 00:58:38,519
Turn him the right way.

497
00:58:56,637 --> 00:58:58,205
Fire, brethren, fire!

498
00:58:59,006 --> 00:59:01,408
Put it out!

499
00:59:21,729 --> 00:59:24,131
You knew about the fire,
didn't you?

500
00:59:24,832 --> 00:59:27,468
No one can know this but God.

501
00:59:27,735 --> 00:59:30,838
You threw a charred log
at my feet. I remember.

502
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:34,375
Many mourn for the righteous,
Father Filaret.

503
00:59:34,909 --> 00:59:36,477
Why didn't you just say it?

504
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:38,846
Why those charred logs?

505
00:59:39,146 --> 00:59:41,982
I'm an ordinary man,
I don't understand your signs.

506
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:45,553
If you are slandered
for Christ's sake,

507
00:59:45,953 --> 00:59:47,555
Then the Spirit of God
dwells in you.

508
00:59:47,955 --> 00:59:49,557
Answer me!

509
00:59:50,024 --> 00:59:51,759
I am your superior!

510
00:59:52,059 --> 00:59:55,996
Blessed are ye
who are persecuted

511
00:59:56,497 --> 00:59:59,767
and slandered for my sake...

512
01:00:00,434 --> 01:00:01,702
Say no more.

513
01:00:05,439 --> 01:00:08,342
Through your prayers, Father,
we have put out the fire.

514
01:00:08,842 --> 01:00:11,645
Your cell is burnt a bit
but we saved the hen.

515
01:00:12,112 --> 01:00:13,480
Enough!

516
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:18,485
Cackling like a hen.

517
01:00:19,453 --> 01:00:22,456
You are not in your office,
but in the house of God!

518
01:00:22,923 --> 01:00:25,693
Let's not discuss
worldly matters here.

519
01:00:26,427 --> 01:00:27,795
Temples love prayer.

520
01:00:31,532 --> 01:00:32,733
Holy Father!

521
01:00:33,033 --> 01:00:35,469
Forgive me, brother Job.
I went too far.

522
01:00:35,803 --> 01:00:37,671
It was your lay brother, Amvrosy.

523
01:00:38,005 --> 01:00:40,474
He filled a lamp with oil,
struck a match

524
01:00:40,875 --> 01:00:42,643
- and dropped it.
- Got it.

525
01:00:43,043 --> 01:00:44,812
We'll fix it in no time.

526
01:01:47,374 --> 01:01:49,443
I'll tell you what, Father Anatoli,

527
01:01:49,777 --> 01:01:51,779
I never wanted to be
a Father Superior.

528
01:01:52,313 --> 01:01:54,081
I wanted to live in the wilderness

529
01:01:54,415 --> 01:01:57,117
as a recluse

530
01:01:58,252 --> 01:02:02,122
I take the fire as a sign for me
to become a hermit.

531
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:04,158
What do you think?

532
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:06,760
I'm not a learned man.
I don't think anything.

533
01:02:07,261 --> 01:02:09,763
I'm here to share your cell with you

534
01:02:10,331 --> 01:02:13,500
while mine is being restored.
Will you accept me?

535
01:02:14,335 --> 01:02:16,403
It's up to you to decide.

536
01:02:17,104 --> 01:02:19,807
- Where do you sleep?
- Right here.

537
01:02:22,276 --> 01:02:25,779
- Here? On the coals?
- Yes. On the coals.

538
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:28,115
You can sleep next to me.

539
01:02:32,553 --> 01:02:33,754
Good.

540
01:02:34,522 --> 01:02:37,191
We'll save ourselves together
and pray jointly.

541
01:02:38,792 --> 01:02:41,128
And think about God

542
01:02:42,663 --> 01:02:44,198
and life eternal.

543
01:02:47,501 --> 01:02:51,672
Mind you, I'm a troublesome bedfellow.
I have coughing fits.

544
01:02:52,573 --> 01:02:54,308
Sometimes I suddenly want to sing

545
01:02:54,742 --> 01:02:57,344
in the dead of night.

546
01:02:58,746 --> 01:03:00,147
You won't mind?

547
01:04:00,875 --> 01:04:02,710
I've long wanted to ask you,
prankster--

548
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:04,979
why do you behave improperly

549
01:04:05,579 --> 01:04:07,381
during the service?

550
01:04:08,349 --> 01:04:10,718
You should pray
in the prescribed way.

551
01:04:11,785 --> 01:04:13,954
If everyone starts praying
in his own way,

552
01:04:15,022 --> 01:04:16,991
where will we be?

553
01:04:17,925 --> 01:04:20,895
What will be left of the church?

554
01:04:24,031 --> 01:04:25,399
Father Filaret,

555
01:04:27,001 --> 01:04:28,602
you've got nice boots.

556
01:04:28,836 --> 01:04:30,037
You like them?

557
01:04:30,938 --> 01:04:33,374
Very. Soft, ain't they?

558
01:04:33,908 --> 01:04:36,677
Oh yes. The only boots
I can wear.

559
01:04:37,011 --> 01:04:38,979
His Beatitude gave them to me
out of kindness.

560
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,749
He knows I have bad feet.

561
01:04:43,517 --> 01:04:45,753
And your blanket's even better.

562
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:47,955
His Beatitude too?

563
01:04:48,489 --> 01:04:50,424
No, I got it in Greece

564
01:04:50,691 --> 01:04:54,094
when the Metropolitan and I
were on a pilgrimage to Athos.

565
01:04:56,697 --> 01:04:58,866
Well... let's go to sleep.

566
01:05:39,707 --> 01:05:41,909
What are you doing,
Father Anatoli?

567
01:05:47,448 --> 01:05:50,451
I'm reading the book of human sins.

568
01:05:51,986 --> 01:05:53,187
When I'm through,

569
01:05:54,788 --> 01:05:55,990
I'll shove it in the stove--

570
01:05:57,658 --> 01:05:58,859
and sin will be no more.

571
01:06:04,865 --> 01:06:06,433
What the hell are you doing?

572
01:06:07,101 --> 01:06:10,504
I'm going to read the second page.

573
01:06:13,707 --> 01:06:16,210
Page? It's my boots.

574
01:06:19,513 --> 01:06:21,148
Another one gone.

575
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:24,151
Didn't you know

576
01:06:24,885 --> 01:06:27,188
most sins nest

577
01:06:27,721 --> 01:06:29,857
in bishops' boot tops?

578
01:06:30,691 --> 01:06:32,593
Clown!

579
01:07:04,625 --> 01:07:05,893
Why is it locked?

580
01:07:07,561 --> 01:07:09,997
- We are going to drive demons out.
- What demons?

581
01:07:10,998 --> 01:07:14,235
They are all around us,
don't you see?

582
01:07:14,869 --> 01:07:16,537
Open up immediately.

583
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:22,710
Demons don't like smoke.
We're gonna smoke them out.

584
01:07:27,081 --> 01:07:28,883
Look where that one got to.

585
01:07:29,583 --> 01:07:30,784
And another one.

586
01:07:31,185 --> 01:07:32,686
You are the demon.

587
01:07:35,723 --> 01:07:36,924
A breeding nest...

588
01:07:37,992 --> 01:07:39,693
Look! Here they are.

589
01:07:50,804 --> 01:07:52,740
Damn them.

590
01:07:53,307 --> 01:07:55,009
Out, out with you!

591
01:07:56,844 --> 01:07:58,946
- But we're going to suffocate.
- It's almost over.

592
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:01,682
We'll get rid of them all.

593
01:08:01,982 --> 01:08:04,852
We're going to suffocate.
Just wait a second.

594
01:08:06,887 --> 01:08:09,690
Why'd you shut the air vent?

595
01:08:11,325 --> 01:08:13,294
You want me dead!

596
01:08:13,928 --> 01:08:15,262
- Wait.
- Air, air!

597
01:08:15,896 --> 01:08:18,098
They're almost all gone.
Go over there.

598
01:08:23,871 --> 01:08:25,105
We did it.

599
01:08:31,846 --> 01:08:35,149
Oh, I forgot the chief demon.

600
01:08:36,217 --> 01:08:37,918
There!

601
01:08:38,619 --> 01:08:40,120
I got ya.

602
01:08:40,688 --> 01:08:43,123
Small but so vicious.

603
01:08:45,192 --> 01:08:46,794
Drown him!

604
01:09:38,245 --> 01:09:39,747
Why are you looking at me?

605
01:09:41,182 --> 01:09:42,383
Mean, ain't I?

606
01:09:45,019 --> 01:09:46,720
That's what I am.

607
01:09:51,692 --> 01:09:53,894
I bear you no grudge, brother.

608
01:09:54,328 --> 01:09:56,363
I am grateful to you, brother.

609
01:09:57,198 --> 01:09:58,465
I really am.

610
01:09:59,366 --> 01:10:02,770
You've delivered me from things
superficial and unnecessary.

611
01:10:04,138 --> 01:10:05,406
I was really attached

612
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:08,709
to those boots and that blanket,

613
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:11,145
and you removed them from me.

614
01:10:12,847 --> 01:10:14,048
Thank you.

615
01:10:17,051 --> 01:10:21,422
And you've shown me
there's little faith in me.

616
01:10:26,293 --> 01:10:28,462
I got really scared.

617
01:10:29,129 --> 01:10:32,266
I'm going to meet death
in his stokehole, I thought.

618
01:10:36,203 --> 01:10:38,839
I feared death
because I had little faith.

619
01:10:42,476 --> 01:10:45,346
It means I am not ready
to meet Our Lord.

620
01:10:49,083 --> 01:10:51,785
I was afraid to face death
unrepented.

621
01:10:55,256 --> 01:10:57,124
There's little virtue in me

622
01:10:58,192 --> 01:10:59,727
but much sin.

623
01:11:02,429 --> 01:11:03,797
Virtue?

624
01:11:05,366 --> 01:11:06,967
My virtues stink

625
01:11:08,502 --> 01:11:10,337
before the Lord.

626
01:11:11,772 --> 01:11:14,141
I can really smell the stench.

627
01:11:15,876 --> 01:11:19,413
Yes, smell it and through that
you'll be saved.

628
01:11:23,284 --> 01:11:24,485
I wonder

629
01:11:26,287 --> 01:11:28,122
why me.

630
01:11:29,256 --> 01:11:31,125
Why has God chosen me

631
01:11:32,126 --> 01:11:33,827
to lead the community?

632
01:11:35,229 --> 01:11:37,998
I should be hanged for my sins

633
01:11:39,063 --> 01:11:42,036
Instead I was made almost a saint.

634
01:11:42,897 --> 01:11:44,872
What is there saintly in me?

635
01:11:47,876 --> 01:11:50,211
There's no peace in my heart.

636
01:12:32,975 --> 01:12:34,014
Tikhon!

637
01:12:36,302 --> 01:12:37,418
Petrovich...

638
01:12:41,911 --> 01:12:43,898
Tikhon Petrovich,

639
01:12:44,713 --> 01:12:45,677
can...

640
01:12:47,122 --> 01:12:49,436
...can you hear me?

641
01:12:49,846 --> 01:12:53,483
Tikhon,
you know all my life.

642
01:12:54,914 --> 01:12:56,872
I'm suffering torments.

643
01:12:57,582 --> 01:13:01,126
I can't live and I can't die.

644
01:13:02,727 --> 01:13:04,018
Brother,

645
01:13:05,075 --> 01:13:07,087
you are my last hope.

646
01:13:08,326 --> 01:13:11,136
My spirit was frail.

647
01:13:12,455 --> 01:13:15,229
I've been carrying
this sin for years.

648
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:17,929
It never releases me,
not even for one second.

649
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:22,136
I know you forgave me.

650
01:13:23,202 --> 01:13:25,099
Pray that God

651
01:13:25,697 --> 01:13:29,085
takes this burden off my chest.

652
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:54,568
The spoon's clanging.

653
01:13:57,538 --> 01:13:59,573
Yes, we are moving.

654
01:14:05,379 --> 01:14:07,047
I don't want your tea.

655
01:14:11,752 --> 01:14:13,120
I do.

656
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:16,924
Why'd you give me that look, Dad?

657
01:14:17,467 --> 01:14:19,110
I didn't.

658
01:14:19,230 --> 01:14:21,395
Yes, you did.

659
01:14:27,034 --> 01:14:29,303
Don't you love me at all?

660
01:14:30,371 --> 01:14:32,606
Why, I do love you, my little girl.

661
01:14:33,073 --> 01:14:35,276
You're lying. You don't.

662
01:14:51,792 --> 01:14:53,460
I can't sit here.

663
01:14:54,028 --> 01:14:55,596
I don't want to sit here.

664
01:14:56,163 --> 01:14:58,232
What's wrong, little girl?

665
01:14:58,532 --> 01:15:00,201
Why do you keep me under lock?

666
01:15:02,736 --> 01:15:04,238
- What?
- Comrade Admiral, I--

667
01:15:04,738 --> 01:15:07,107
- What do you want?
- I'm sorry...

668
01:15:51,452 --> 01:15:53,621
You think I'm sick?

669
01:15:55,122 --> 01:15:57,758
Of course not.

670
01:15:58,158 --> 01:16:03,264
You are tired.
You need a good rest.

671
01:16:11,826 --> 01:16:13,607
But I am sick.

672
01:16:22,216 --> 01:16:24,084
Very sick.

673
01:16:58,755 --> 01:17:02,189
O Lord Jesus Christ,
have mercy on us.

674
01:17:04,963 --> 01:17:06,227
Amen.

675
01:17:29,717 --> 01:17:31,819
Why did you send me that incense?

676
01:17:35,723 --> 01:17:37,291
There'll be a funeral on Wednesday.

677
01:17:37,424 --> 01:17:41,161
- Whose funeral?
- His whom the Lord has chosen.

678
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:43,898
What are you talking about?

679
01:17:44,455 --> 01:17:46,033
The waves of death

680
01:17:47,123 --> 01:17:48,402
have washed over me

681
01:17:49,937 --> 01:17:51,906
and deadly nets have enmeshed me.

682
01:17:55,869 --> 01:17:57,444
Do you really

683
01:17:59,521 --> 01:18:01,182
want to die?

684
01:18:01,935 --> 01:18:03,660
I'll get you a coffin.

685
01:18:04,339 --> 01:18:07,188
Oak? Pine? You name it.
It doesn't matter.

686
01:18:08,022 --> 01:18:09,924
It's not necessary.
I have one already.

687
01:18:10,457 --> 01:18:11,825
Where is it?

688
01:18:12,393 --> 01:18:15,129
On the porch.
See that box over there?

689
01:18:16,897 --> 01:18:20,701
You can't even die like
a human being.

690
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:25,406
Why don't we order a proper coffin?

691
01:18:27,975 --> 01:18:29,877
I want the box, Father. The box.

692
01:18:31,579 --> 01:18:33,781
That's my will.

693
01:18:36,717 --> 01:18:38,752
What kind of person are you?

694
01:18:39,086 --> 01:18:41,055
You even can't die without tricks.

695
01:18:41,355 --> 01:18:43,090
All men lie in coffins,

696
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:46,760
even the venerable saints.

697
01:18:47,094 --> 01:18:50,297
But he wants a box with ropes.

698
01:18:50,931 --> 01:18:54,101
That's vanity.

699
01:18:54,401 --> 01:18:55,769
Vanity!

700
01:19:02,309 --> 01:19:05,045
You actually like me, Father Job,

701
01:19:07,281 --> 01:19:08,482
don't you?

702
01:19:15,256 --> 01:19:17,525
I can't stomach you,

703
01:19:18,926 --> 01:19:20,261
old fogy.

704
01:19:22,796 --> 01:19:24,832
You asked me

705
01:19:25,232 --> 01:19:27,468
why Cain killed Abel.
I'll tell you.

706
01:19:28,969 --> 01:19:31,872
I tried to help others like you

707
01:19:32,973 --> 01:19:35,009
but the Lord wouldn't accept
my sacrifice.

708
01:19:41,882 --> 01:19:43,551
Oh, why am I talking to you?

709
01:19:45,986 --> 01:19:47,188
Wait.

710
01:19:50,324 --> 01:19:53,561
When I die will you weep for me?

711
01:21:43,103 --> 01:21:44,471
What's with you, Nastya?

712
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:59,153
Having fun, Father Anatoli?

713
01:22:13,067 --> 01:22:15,703
I hear you prankster
are preparing to die.

714
01:22:17,004 --> 01:22:18,205
So they've told you.

715
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:21,709
I don't want to lose you.

716
01:22:25,012 --> 01:22:26,881
I am wondering

717
01:22:28,048 --> 01:22:30,117
whether I should tonsure you?

718
01:22:32,653 --> 01:22:33,854
What do you mean?

719
01:22:34,655 --> 01:22:36,524
I've lived an earthly life

720
01:22:36,891 --> 01:22:39,160
I avoided the Law

721
01:22:40,327 --> 01:22:42,296
and should I now give up everything?

722
01:22:42,863 --> 01:22:46,000
Father, forget it.
That's out of the question.

723
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:47,835
What are you talking about?

724
01:22:48,335 --> 01:22:50,905
Sins. Burning sins.

725
01:22:51,805 --> 01:22:53,807
They've burnt my heart out.

726
01:22:54,608 --> 01:22:57,111
You are speaking in riddles
again, brother.

727
01:22:57,845 --> 01:23:00,614
There is no sin
the Lord cannot pardon,

728
01:23:00,948 --> 01:23:03,751
for nothing is impossible
for Him.

729
01:23:23,904 --> 01:23:25,339
That's enough.

730
01:23:38,018 --> 01:23:39,987
There there.

731
01:23:40,221 --> 01:23:42,022
You didn't come on your own, right?

732
01:23:43,257 --> 01:23:45,259
My dad's... over there.

733
01:23:46,093 --> 01:23:47,895
- And the name is--
- Nastya.

734
01:23:49,063 --> 01:23:51,832
Not yours, your father's.

735
01:23:53,234 --> 01:23:55,936
Tikhon Petrovich.
He's an admiral.

736
01:23:57,671 --> 01:23:58,973
Admiral?

737
01:24:00,241 --> 01:24:02,343
I'm glad he's an admiral.

738
01:24:08,282 --> 01:24:09,650
You can go

739
01:24:11,285 --> 01:24:12,987
hang around here.

740
01:24:20,895 --> 01:24:24,331
I'm sorry, she is sick.

741
01:24:28,769 --> 01:24:29,970
What's wrong with you?

742
01:24:30,437 --> 01:24:33,674
Can I help you?

743
01:24:34,742 --> 01:24:39,380
No, thanks. Angels are singing
in my heart.

744
01:24:40,281 --> 01:24:43,317
Sorry, she is not quite herself.

745
01:24:44,385 --> 01:24:47,922
I've taken her to doctors.
We even went to Moscow.

746
01:24:47,988 --> 01:24:49,423
Nothing's helped.

747
01:24:51,425 --> 01:24:55,229
I hear there's a holy man here
at the monastery.

748
01:24:56,530 --> 01:24:59,567
If he can't help
I don't know who can.

749
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:01,402
How long has she been like that?

750
01:25:01,769 --> 01:25:03,370
Four years and a half

751
01:25:05,206 --> 01:25:06,574
since her husband died.

752
01:25:07,141 --> 01:25:09,109
He was a submariner
in the Barents Sea.

753
01:25:09,643 --> 01:25:12,213
Tell me, your holy man--

754
01:25:14,515 --> 01:25:18,018
- can he heal the insane?
- She is not insane.

755
01:25:19,153 --> 01:25:20,354
What's with her?

756
01:25:20,621 --> 01:25:21,822
She's possessed.

757
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:24,658
There's a demon inside her
who torments her.

758
01:25:25,326 --> 01:25:28,229
It sounds absurd, forgive me.

759
01:25:28,562 --> 01:25:31,765
- How do you know?
- I know him personally.

760
01:25:31,832 --> 01:25:33,601
Who?

761
01:25:34,201 --> 01:25:35,603
The demon.

762
01:25:41,342 --> 01:25:43,310
Nastya,

763
01:25:43,777 --> 01:25:45,579
where are you? Nastya!

764
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:48,482
Let's get out of here.

765
01:25:56,157 --> 01:25:58,292
Hey, Nastya!

766
01:27:09,530 --> 01:27:10,931
Come out. We've arrived.

767
01:27:11,532 --> 01:27:14,335
I'm not going with you.

768
01:27:15,936 --> 01:27:17,538
You have to, darling.

769
01:27:17,905 --> 01:27:19,573
No. I'm tired.

770
01:27:20,174 --> 01:27:21,675
You go, I'll stay here.

771
01:27:24,578 --> 01:27:26,480
I'm not coming with you.

772
01:27:33,387 --> 01:27:35,156
You are a nasty person.

773
01:27:39,426 --> 01:27:41,295
And your island is nasty.

774
01:27:43,964 --> 01:27:45,666
- I'm not coming with you.
- You have to.

775
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:47,868
You have to.
Don't be afraid.

776
01:27:48,369 --> 01:27:50,204
- I'm not coming
- You'll be fine.

777
01:27:51,505 --> 01:27:53,474
I don't want to go.

778
01:27:55,309 --> 01:27:56,944
I don't want to go.

779
01:28:42,857 --> 01:28:45,960
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

780
01:28:55,603 --> 01:28:59,406
O Lord Jesus Christ,
Thy will be done.

781
01:29:18,201 --> 01:29:21,184
The Lord shall rise,

782
01:29:21,762 --> 01:29:24,065
and His enemies shall be dispersed,

783
01:29:24,409 --> 01:29:26,323
and vanish like smoke.

784
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:28,646
As wax melts before fire,

785
01:29:29,041 --> 01:29:31,939
so will the devils perish
before those who love God,

786
01:29:32,352 --> 01:29:34,675
before those who make
the sign of the cross

787
01:29:34,909 --> 01:29:36,500
and say joyfully:

788
01:29:36,784 --> 01:29:38,741
Precious and Life-giving Cross

789
01:29:38,994 --> 01:29:41,520
which drives away demons,

790
01:29:42,088 --> 01:29:45,818
by the power of our Lord Jesus Christ
crucified on you!

791
01:29:46,335 --> 01:29:49,855
He went down to hell and trampled
on the power of the devil,

792
01:29:49,975 --> 01:29:53,740
and gave to us His venerable Cross
to drive away all enemies.

793
01:29:54,363 --> 01:29:57,264
O most Pure and Life-giving Cross
of the Lord,

794
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:00,708
help me with the Holy Virgin
the Mother of God

795
01:30:00,828 --> 01:30:03,671
and with all Saints
forever and ever. Amen.

796
01:31:13,693 --> 01:31:15,174
Praise the Lord.

797
01:31:16,234 --> 01:31:17,430
O Lord,

798
01:31:17,928 --> 01:31:19,735
giver of life and health,

799
01:31:19,855 --> 01:31:21,549
succor the sick.

800
01:31:23,111 --> 01:31:24,531
Amen.

801
01:32:43,401 --> 01:32:46,262
Now you are well.

802
01:32:57,611 --> 01:32:58,813
Have a good cry.

803
01:33:43,824 --> 01:33:45,192
Thank you.

804
01:33:45,626 --> 01:33:49,129
I don't know
how I can thank you enough.

805
01:33:50,764 --> 01:33:54,235
Nastya is shining.

806
01:33:54,835 --> 01:33:57,538
We should thank God.

807
01:33:58,305 --> 01:33:59,807
Now go to the church.

808
01:34:00,374 --> 01:34:04,245
Nastya should confess her sins
and receive communion.

809
01:34:07,381 --> 01:34:11,452
Don't you want to confess?

810
01:34:12,186 --> 01:34:14,755
I don't understand.

811
01:34:16,287 --> 01:34:18,285
Come, I'll explain everything.

812
01:34:32,385 --> 01:34:34,208
Don't be afraid, Admiral.

813
01:34:35,376 --> 01:34:39,814
No one is going to test your
loyalty to the Party.

814
01:34:41,549 --> 01:34:44,318
I am not afraid of anyone.

815
01:34:45,386 --> 01:34:47,354
I've had my share of fear.

816
01:34:50,424 --> 01:34:54,762
But I really don't see
what this is about.

817
01:34:57,865 --> 01:35:00,501
In '42 I was taken prisoner.

818
01:35:02,303 --> 01:35:03,504
I was young.

819
01:35:03,838 --> 01:35:07,808
The Germans promised me life

820
01:35:08,309 --> 01:35:10,511
if I shot my mate.

821
01:35:15,583 --> 01:35:20,621
- Where did you serve?
- Here in the Northern fleet.

822
01:35:22,323 --> 01:35:24,091
What was your mate's name?

823
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:27,228
I don't remember.

824
01:35:28,128 --> 01:35:30,598
He was older than me,

825
01:35:31,732 --> 01:35:33,667
a skipper on a tugboat.

826
01:35:41,242 --> 01:35:43,577
Why don't you ask

827
01:35:44,678 --> 01:35:46,547
if I shot him?

828
01:35:48,482 --> 01:35:51,352
Well, did you?

829
01:35:53,921 --> 01:35:55,289
I did.

830
01:35:56,757 --> 01:36:00,227
I don't know how to live with it.

831
01:36:02,463 --> 01:36:03,898
Me neither.

832
01:36:07,401 --> 01:36:10,704
Why did you tell me?

833
01:36:12,273 --> 01:36:13,808
I am old

834
01:36:15,176 --> 01:36:18,979
and afraid to die with this sin.

835
01:36:19,046 --> 01:36:20,214
I'm afraid.

836
01:36:20,281 --> 01:36:22,750
Don't be afraid.

837
01:36:24,185 --> 01:36:26,887
Die in peace, Father.

838
01:36:30,658 --> 01:36:32,726
I know the man.

839
01:36:35,262 --> 01:36:36,964
He survived.

840
01:36:39,567 --> 01:36:40,768
You just shot

841
01:36:43,404 --> 01:36:45,339
through his arm.

842
01:36:48,943 --> 01:36:50,311
Then there was a blast

843
01:36:51,645 --> 01:36:54,315
and he fell overboard
and grabbed a plank.

844
01:36:55,282 --> 01:36:58,319
He was rescued
the next morning.

845
01:37:04,792 --> 01:37:05,993
Forgive me.

846
01:37:08,762 --> 01:37:10,631
Forgive me.

847
01:37:13,467 --> 01:37:14,902
I've forgiven you long ago.

848
01:37:15,803 --> 01:37:18,873
I was sure you hadn't survived.

849
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:22,009
I thought since you were
on the tugboat...

850
01:37:27,781 --> 01:37:32,686
Tikhon, go in peace.

851
01:37:34,321 --> 01:37:35,523
God be with you.

852
01:39:10,618 --> 01:39:12,052
Thank you, brothers.

853
01:39:17,024 --> 01:39:18,392
Good job.

854
01:39:18,692 --> 01:39:22,496
We sand-papered it first,
then varnished.

855
01:39:23,097 --> 01:39:26,634
You can well use it
as a sideboard.

856
01:39:27,735 --> 01:39:28,936
Like it?

857
01:39:29,904 --> 01:39:33,574
I need a coffin, not a sideboard.

858
01:39:37,578 --> 01:39:41,715
I tried to please you.

859
01:39:43,117 --> 01:39:45,085
Nothing ever pleases you.

860
01:39:50,124 --> 01:39:53,594
I can get some sandpaper
and we'll scratch it off

861
01:39:54,128 --> 01:39:57,665
or dirty it with your coal.
Tell me what you want.

862
01:39:57,731 --> 01:40:00,100
I'll do it for you.

863
01:40:01,202 --> 01:40:03,571
Father Job,

864
01:40:05,039 --> 01:40:07,174
forgive me, an old fool.

865
01:40:07,975 --> 01:40:10,444
Forgive me the soot and Cain

866
01:40:11,445 --> 01:40:13,047
and this sideboard.

867
01:40:13,581 --> 01:40:15,416
- It is all right.
- Forgive me for Christ's sake.

868
01:40:15,749 --> 01:40:19,420
Let bygones be bygones.
You pardon me.

869
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:21,822
I've been unjust to you.

870
01:40:22,690 --> 01:40:24,658
Pardon me for Christ's sake.

871
01:40:24,959 --> 01:40:26,160
God will.

872
01:40:26,961 --> 01:40:28,662
Glory be to Thee, O Lord.

873
01:40:28,996 --> 01:40:31,198
Watch me.

874
01:40:31,866 --> 01:40:33,501
I'll take a chunk of coal...

875
01:40:34,902 --> 01:40:38,606
See that?

876
01:40:38,939 --> 01:40:42,676
Just what you wish,
Father Anatoli.

877
01:40:55,689 --> 01:40:57,892
Father Job, give me a hand.

878
01:41:21,148 --> 01:41:22,650
Here I am.

879
01:41:23,484 --> 01:41:27,688
Go tell Father Filaret

880
01:41:27,755 --> 01:41:30,257
the servant of God, Anatoli

881
01:41:30,324 --> 01:41:31,926
has passed away.

882
01:41:34,295 --> 01:41:39,266
Father Anatoli...

883
01:41:40,668 --> 01:41:42,470
aren't you afraid to die?

884
01:41:44,138 --> 01:41:48,108
I'm not afraid to die.

885
01:41:49,577 --> 01:41:51,979
I'm afraid to stand before God.

886
01:41:52,947 --> 01:41:54,715
My sins are oppressing me.

887
01:41:57,284 --> 01:41:59,153
How should I live?

888
01:42:00,387 --> 01:42:03,691
We are all sinners.
Live the way you can.

889
01:42:04,959 --> 01:42:07,261
Just try not to sin too much.

890
01:42:08,629 --> 01:42:10,097
Well, enough of that.

891
01:42:10,965 --> 01:42:13,934
Enough talking.
Go, my dear, go.

892
01:42:15,736 --> 01:42:17,138
God be with you.

893
01:42:58,279 --> 01:43:00,147
O Lord...

894
01:43:00,848 --> 01:43:04,351
receive my sinful soul.
