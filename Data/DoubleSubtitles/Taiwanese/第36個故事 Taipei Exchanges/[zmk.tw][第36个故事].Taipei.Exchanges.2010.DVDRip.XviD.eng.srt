1
00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:50.965
This is a latte

2
00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.374
Taipeipeople'sfavorite coffee

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:57.149
Dorisdoesn'tlike
decorating the eurteoo

4
00:01:58.218 --> 00:01:59.242
Itthere'se beDere...

5
00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.246
youcan'tsee how the cream blends

6
00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:03.217
with the mild teem

7
00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:06.091
It'sdifferent each time

8
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.568
These are ecleire

9
00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:24.004
Doris'sbest dessert

10
00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:29.876
Look...

11
00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.607
Each one is slightly different

12
00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:34.915
Because food is much lidsd¡ã¡ãd'¡ã

13
00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:36.716
Not all the same

14
00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:44.092
If you fancy tastingDoris'saclaira...

15
00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:46.764
you'llneed to come
toDoris'sCafe on a Wedneodoy

Dee, tde deeeeD menu odeedee doily

17
00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:57.502
This is Doris

18
00:02:57.977 --> 00:02:59.501
The owner ofDoris'sCofo

19
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.310
She'slong dreamt

20
00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:03.379
of having an elegant coffee Shod

21
00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:05.015
A year ago...

22
00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:07.346
when her aunt emigrated to Shanghai...

23
00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:09.114
she knew the moment had come

24
00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:10.750
She told her former hone

25
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.150
she was quitting

26
00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:17.724
This thing is really not bad

27
00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:19.529
And really expensive

28
00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:21.263
Many people want one

29
00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:23.224
You want to see?

30
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.964
You...

31
00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:27.739
Look closely at the joints

32
00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:29.703
It'sso well made

33
00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:31.705
Take a look

34
00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:32.673
Take a good look

35
00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:33.901
Explain to her, Ah Kuo!

36
00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:35.805
Now watch...

37
00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:36.847
its best feature!

38
00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:39.308
One, two, three...

39
00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:40.883
The Flying Fist!

40
00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:44.484
This isDoris'sCafe

41
00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:47.252
Now you see it...

42
00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:48.587
Not all that elegant

43
00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.826
Why does the coffee shop look like thisy

44
00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:54.892
Betere wed¡ãee with the steW...

45
00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:56.533
lets just listen in for a moment

46
00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.067
These are Dories leteet thoughts

47
00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:02.939
As I see if, a beautiful cup...

48
00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:05.269
is woAh more
than a baseball aibeab by a afar

49
00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:07.042
I'mtelling you

50
00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:09.813
The pictureisn'tworth that much

51
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.749
In that customers mind...

52
00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:14.512
the picture is worth more
thee the eotiee toy

53
00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:16.882
If wehadn'tlived here before...

54
00:04:17.123 --> 00:04:18.112
Iwouldn'tswap if

55
00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:19.451
And in my sisters mind...

56
00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:21.991
the pictureisn'twoAh

57
00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:23.788
the price of two coffees

58
00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:25.361
That'senough talk

59
00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:28.627
Another coffee,

60
00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:34.971
I'llhave another toe

61
00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:36.937
Okay...

62
00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:38.842
If you really want it that much...

63
00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:40.972
I'llswap with you

64
00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:42.546
Really?

65
00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.007
What matters most is

66
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.808
its inner value

67
00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:10.175
She'sexhausted.

68
00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:12.305
Take a rest yourself too.

69
00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:13.637

He gets to ooco Os the coot of o betel

504
00:29:37.542 --> 00:29:39.237
It nobody wants a bar at soap...

505
00:29:40.178 --> 00:29:42.840
I can throw in a story with each one

506
00:29:43.581 --> 00:29:44.570

513
00:29:57.996 --> 00:29:59.793
Deep in the forests there...

514
00:30:00.098 --> 00:30:01.531
you can find the Decil Tree

515
00:30:01.699 --> 00:30:03.530
Why'sit called that?

516
00:30:03.935 --> 00:30:05.960
They say that it yaa small its tradraaca...

517
00:30:40.438 --> 00:30:41.496
They say a group of people

518
00:30:41.739 --> 00:30:44.105
set out to find the Devil Tree

519
00:30:44.409 --> 00:30:47.401
They were determined

Everything else you can see here...

Like all that stuff on the choices...

That'sall for exchange

590
00:34:13.951 --> 00:34:14.975
Exchange?

591
00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:17.915
How about telling her a stew

00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:41.003
Not such a tair exchange...

603
00:34:41.212 --> 00:34:42.304

669
00:37:47.498 --> 00:37:49.625
Got pimples all over her face...

670
00:37:50.668 --> 00:37:51.862
Didnt get a second glance tram days

671
00:37:52.103 --> 00:37:54.003
when she went out

672
00:37:54.505 --> 00:37:56.097
The better her grades became...

673
00:37:56.641 --> 00:37:58.632
the more she lacked self-confidence

674
00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:00.841
She got into a corfl good school

675
00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.041
But shewasn'tat all happy

676
00:38:04.882 --> 00:38:06.816
Sometimes shah osma hams...

677
00:38:07.818 --> 00:38:09.115
and find postcards

678
00:38:09.353 --> 00:38:11.014
from my travels in fda maildaa

679
00:38:13.224 --> 00:38:15.954
While studying alone late at night...

680
00:38:16.994 --> 00:38:18.791
shed tied hereelt remembering...

681
00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:22.890
the days when she could
jest go ereeeh with her peppy

682
00:38:25.736 --> 00:38:27.397
She'dteIP te the peppy...

683
00:38:29.106 --> 00:38:31.540
¡°Look,that'sacloud¡±

684
00:38:33.177 --> 00:38:35.509
¡°Look,that'sadattoL'

685
00:38:37.048 --> 00:38:38.106
¡°Look...¡±

686
00:38:39.417 --> 00:38:40.679
¡°thoseare trafficlights¡±

687
00:38:48.059 --> 00:38:49.424
So she hated our Ma

688
00:38:50.895 --> 00:38:52.726
Whycouldn'tshe let her trecely

689
00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:56.891
She hated me too

690
00:38:58.369 --> 00:39:00.132
Whyhadn'tI picked the¡°Stehy¡±paper?

691
00:39:07.044 --> 00:39:09.535
It'sthrough all these things here that
she ease the wsrlh

692
00:39:10.948 --> 00:39:12.313
She'ssever bees shresh

693
00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:15.778
The reason she
runs this exchange system...

694
00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:19.082
is so that she can hear mere eteries
she'smisesh estee hereelt

695
00:39:21.492 --> 00:39:23.050
That puppy strap is French

696
00:39:23.794 --> 00:39:25.853
And it looks
just liPs the peg she sacs had

697
00:39:27.431 --> 00:39:29.023
The moment you stepped in here...

698
00:39:29.867 --> 00:39:31.300
she knew that your peppy strep
hod mony stories

699
00:39:31.535 --> 00:39:32.661

719
00:41:10.901 --> 00:41:12.198
If my tuition fees had been spent

720

721

But if you put a price on it...

00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:14.717
you can calculate
when people bring things to nnchengn

I'lltell you a otory from Phoenix

778
00:44:46.917 --> 00:44:47.576
Once upon a time...

779
00:44:47.818 --> 00:44:49.615
there was a small town in Arizona

780
00:44:49.987 --> 00:44:52.319
Ann ynar, tharna a navarn hraaght

781
00:44:52.556 --> 00:44:53.716
The local people,

00:44:53.957 --> 00:44:55.390
one by one, move out

783
00:44:55.626 --> 00:44:58.390
One boy in pooioulor is very sad to go

784
00:44:58.662 --> 00:44:59.856
So he buries oomethieg

785
00:45:00.097 --> 00:45:02.122
under a cactus

786
00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:04.228
Was it this bar of soap?

787
00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:06.696
Too long ago!

788
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:09.532
Anyhow, he keeps on walking
for about two wooho

789
00:45:09.773 --> 00:45:10.671
Now, theres the boss of a restaurant...

He looks up and sees the boy

792
00:45:14.912 --> 00:45:17.904
All of a sudden, tears steA

797
00:45:29.626 --> 00:45:30.957
Long thorns from his eyeballs...

Miss, excuse me...

806
00:47:00.984 --> 00:47:02.076
My friend would like to have this book

807
00:47:02.319 --> 00:47:03.786

Excuse me, Miss...

814

Sorry

821
00:47:37.454 --> 00:47:38.751

I took the rocking horse in ooohongo
fore gaiter in the Prof piece

823

854
00:49:41.745 --> 00:49:51.381
¡°They'realways in mydreams¡±

855
00:49:51.621 --> 00:49:57.287
The unforgettable place where I was born

856
00:49:57.527 --> 00:49:59.358
Whets the purpose at eacheegieg thiege?

857
00:49:59.763 --> 00:50:01.355
It you were to ask Jooio...

858
00:50:01.765 --> 00:50:03.426
she might not have an onowor

859
00:50:04.167 --> 00:50:05.429
Butthat'snot to imply that

860
00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:07.500
ohs'sin any way illogiool

861
00:50:08.071 --> 00:50:11.370
Just that her logic works something

Ash whet sheet DerieJ

863
00:50:25.522 --> 00:50:26.989
She used to think exchanges were

864
00:50:27.224 --> 00:50:28.691
unprofitable end sweets of time

865
00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:31.884
But the concept of¡®innervalue'

866
00:50:32.129 --> 00:50:33.357
has lodged in her mind

867
00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:35.522
So things have changed

868
00:50:42.839 --> 00:50:44.033
¡°Ityou could ohoooo,

869

it will spoil the look at it

1039
00:59:41.411 --> 00:59:42.810
The ones you should pick are...

1040
00:59:44.013 --> 00:59:46.675
the round ones with no homodo

1041

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:20.343
Wait and see

1045
01:00:22.151 --> 01:00:23.413
Imagine a picture...

1046
01:00:23.653 --> 01:00:24.312
The whole of the city...

1047
01:00:24.554 --> 01:00:26.545
is empty,no-one'sthere

1048
01:00:27.357 --> 01:00:28.483
One day...

1049
01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:30.217
There'sa painter
who wakes up in a hotel ream

high up en the Pbth Peer

1051
01:00:32.695 --> 01:00:34.720
He stands at the huge picture-window

01:00:35.865 --> 01:00:38.356
He realises
thatthere'ses-see hews there

1053
01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:43.561
Ifyou'regod...

1054
01:00:43.973 --> 01:00:45.235
just create any two people

1055
01:00:45.608 --> 01:00:47.166
Then the stow can begin

1056
01:00:48.077 --> 01:00:49.305
He thinks of something

1057
01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:51.803
He takes some paper and draws a girl

1058
01:00:52.515 --> 01:00:54.142
He carefully cute Par cut...

1059

The girl wanders elena threegh the city

1061
01:01:01.424 --> 01:01:02.857
She drinks coffee alone

1062
01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:05.254
She surveys the scenery alone

1063
01:01:06.696 --> 01:01:08.630
The painter thinksshe'stoo lonely

1064
01:01:09.298 --> 01:01:11.095
So he hrewe a men tee

Lets him fly away too

1066
01:01:15.304 --> 01:01:16.771
But the paper man...

1067
01:01:17.306 --> 01:01:19.467
flies off in a different direction

1068
01:01:20.576 --> 01:01:22.441
He lands eemewdere else

1069
01:01:23.312 --> 01:01:25.405
So he also drinks coffee alone

1070

Before you sell a coffee,

But they were his memories

1128

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:18.231
What will you have to drink?

1162
01:07:18.801 --> 01:07:19.290
Coffee

1163
01:07:19.535 --> 01:07:20.559
Coffee for everyone?

1164
01:07:20.803 --> 01:07:21.792
Iced or hot?

1165
01:07:22.271 --> 01:07:24.569
Our manager has an idea
about franchising

1166
01:07:26.108 --> 01:07:27.200
branch iaiag?

1167
01:07:27.643 --> 01:07:29.008
Let me explain

1168
01:07:29.278 --> 01:07:30.836
If a foreign friend visits you...

1169
01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:33.742
you'llguide them
around the place,

1170
01:07:33.983 --> 01:07:35.177
for sure
You'llmoot liholy

1171
01:07:35.418 --> 01:07:37.750
bring them to your home too

1172
01:07:37.987 --> 01:07:38.316
So if...

1173
01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:39.885
So it this place
happened to be your home...

1174
01:07:40.122 --> 01:07:41.817
What could ho heifer, right?

1175
01:07:42.358 --> 01:07:44.519
By¡®franchising'they mean a takeover

1176
01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.728
Theydon'twest oemmieeiee,

1177
01:07:46.962 --> 01:07:48.190
No,that'snot it

1178
01:07:48.431 --> 01:07:49.659
We'rejust here

1179
01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:52.367

1180
01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:54.096
Whatwe'dlike is...

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:56.736
for you to tell us what you think of it

1182
01:07:57.139 --> 01:07:59.073
In toot, our oompouy is looking

1183
01:07:59.308 --> 01:08:00.969
for investments

1184
01:08:02.478 --> 01:08:03.536
If you were thinking...

1185
01:08:03.712 --> 01:08:05.577
of raising more capital by any chance...

1186
01:08:05.815 --> 01:08:07.248
Anb itwa Pabst cams bars tabay...

1187
01:08:07.483 --> 01:08:08.745
Wouldn'tthat have been a shame?

1188
01:08:08.984 --> 01:08:10.451
We eel? nell veffee here

1189

Didnt you two go back and tell them?

1190
01:08:12.888 --> 01:08:14.617
We sell coffee, not the bueie000

1191
01:08:14.857 --> 01:08:16.620
Or you can bring something
to exchange

1192
01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:20.295
In thin hnninnnn...

1193
01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:22.554
my sisters share is larger than mine

1194
01:08:22.798 --> 01:08:24.288
But you cas have my share...

1195
01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:26.194
if you bring me air tickets in exchange

1196

01:09:04.273 --> 01:09:05.672
How could you do that?

1199
01:09:06.008 --> 01:09:07.202

Watching my kid grow up

1282
01:14:53.822 --> 01:14:55.517
To make my son proud at ma

1283

innocence

1296
01:15:16.545 --> 01:15:19.810
Because kids do all kinds of things

1297
01:15:20.115 --> 01:15:23.243
quite naturally

1298
01:15:23.485 --> 01:15:26.511
But when they grow up

1299
01:15:26.755 --> 01:15:28.985
and the world eterte judging them...

1300
01:15:29.224 --> 01:15:33.251
Or when onoein adele
