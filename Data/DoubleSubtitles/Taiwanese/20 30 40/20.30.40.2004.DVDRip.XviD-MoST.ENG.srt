1
00:00:30,877 --> 00:00:33,903
We've started our descent.
Please put your seat back up.

2
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:35,981
Let me help you.

3
00:00:37,484 --> 00:00:39,918
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

4
00:00:43,657 --> 00:00:46,990
Sir, please put your seat back up.

5
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,060
-Is your boyfriend meeting you?
-The old one or the young one?

6
00:01:24,665 --> 00:01:25,927
You?

7
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:28,294
The married one
or the single one?

8
00:01:37,811 --> 00:01:40,245
Hello!
Are you coming to pick me up?

9
00:01:40,414 --> 00:01:42,575
<i>Xiang, I'm with a patient.</i>

10
00:01:43,016 --> 00:01:46,645
I've heard that one before,
Brian!

11
00:01:46,987 --> 00:01:51,321
<i>-Are you with your wife?
-I really am with a patient.</i>

12
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,854
Okay, don't come, then.

13
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:56,222
You don't ever have to pick me
up again.

14
00:01:57,597 --> 00:02:00,293
Let me call you back.

15
00:02:06,306 --> 00:02:08,137
-Sandy?
-Yeah?

16
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:10,538
Sandy, my precious?

17
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:14,010
Was your birthday trip fun?

18
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:15,978
It was okay.

19
00:02:16,149 --> 00:02:20,882
Dad, our daughter's
going away.

20
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:23,481
Say a few words.

21
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:28,924
You're glued to that game,
Sandy.

22
00:02:29,262 --> 00:02:30,923
You'll go blind!

23
00:02:32,366 --> 00:02:33,628
Yeah, sure.

24
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,496
-Look at this, Dad.
-Here's the luggage now.

25
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,798
Let me know when you have time.

26
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:44,477
Right, of course I will.

27
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:47,703
No problem.

28
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:41,992
Hi, is Shi Ge there?

29
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:45,304
This is Xiao Jie.
I'm here in Taipei.

30
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:47,770
Are you coming to pick me up?

31
00:03:49,743 --> 00:03:53,304
Hoping East Road.
But I've never been here before.

32
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,244
What if I can't find it?

33
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:16,228
<i>Hello?</i>

34
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:19,500
Still mad at me, Xiang?

35
00:04:20,073 --> 00:04:22,974
<i>I was mixing for Gigi that day.
I couldn't get away.</i>

36
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:26,044
I don't care if it was Gigi
or Madonna.

37
00:04:26,213 --> 00:04:28,443
I never want to see you again.

38
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:30,082
<i>Why?</i>

39
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:32,415
We're just not right
for each other.

40
00:04:32,586 --> 00:04:34,019
<i>Why?</i>

41
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:37,688
Why what? Why always ''why''?

42
00:04:37,924 --> 00:04:40,518
<i>-I'm boarding now.
-Didn't you just land?</i>

43
00:04:41,962 --> 00:04:44,954
I know you did. I checked.
You just got back, didn't you?

44
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:48,896
We need you here, Qi.

45
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,031
Okay.

46
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:10,388
Good morning, Mr. Jack!

47
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,559
You're not up yet?

48
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,394
But it's already 7 a.m.
in New York!

49
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:21,458
I just came back from Malaysia.

50
00:05:21,635 --> 00:05:24,627
Wait a minute.

51
00:05:26,907 --> 00:05:29,273
Give it to me straight.

52
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:32,138
Are you sleeping alone?

53
00:05:34,147 --> 00:05:36,377
We're not seeing each other.

54
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,780
You can tell me the truth.

55
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:45,319
Me? I sleep alone sometimes.

56
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:51,361
Sometimes with someone.
Sometimes with lots of people.

57
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,533
I have to when I'm
on the plane!

58
00:05:56,703 --> 00:05:59,365
I called because I was bored!

59
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:05,876
How can I find a decent man
with all the flying?

60
00:06:07,347 --> 00:06:09,975
What else can I do?

61
00:06:10,884 --> 00:06:15,719
I'm not going to follow my mother
and teach piano!

62
00:06:15,922 --> 00:06:18,186
It hasn't gotten that bad yet.

63
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:21,827
Never forget,
it was my mother who broke us up.

64
00:06:25,432 --> 00:06:29,664
Fortunately,
I didn't marry you then.

65
00:06:29,836 --> 00:06:32,532
It'd be tragic to be married
to a playboy like you.

66
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:36,872
Would you really take care of me
in my old age?

67
00:06:38,912 --> 00:06:41,676
It's good to be home. I'm beat.

68
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:44,180
Aren't you going to work?

69
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:49,653
What's wrong with these lights?

70
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:53,019
All alone with no one
to fix the lights for me.

71
00:07:18,151 --> 00:07:20,176
Help.

72
00:07:28,395 --> 00:07:32,627
<i>The Meteorology Center
reports that the earthquake...</i>

73
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:35,734
<i>...was 5.0 on the Richter scale.</i>

74

everyone feeling after the quake?</i>

80
00:08:02,262 --> 00:08:04,730
<i>Let's go to some live interviews.</i>

81
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:07,263
<i>Why are you still on the street?</i>

82
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:12,031
<i>-I came out with my girlfriend.
-What about aftershocks?</i>

83
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:13,900
Xiang, are you okay?

84
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:16,799
Please open the door!

85
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:23,014
Xiang!

86
00:08:23,483 --> 00:08:25,348
Are you there?

87
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:27,280
Let me in!

88
00:08:29,723 --> 00:08:32,351
Is someone with you?

89
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:37,128
Open up!

90
00:08:38,498 --> 00:08:40,125
Xiang!

91
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:43,863
Open the door!

92
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:55,209
<i>-Hello?
-Miss Ku...</i>

93
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:58,350
<i>...your windshield's been smashed.
Shall I call the police?</i>

94
00:08:58,518 --> 00:09:00,383
No, ignore him.

95
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:19,299
Hello?

96
00:09:19,472 --> 00:09:22,737
<i>-I can come over pretty soon.
-No, don't.</i>

97
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:24,342
-Brian.
-Meet me at Pixel.

98
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:26,342
<i>-No.
-Brian.</i>

99
00:09:26,513 --> 00:09:28,708
-I'll wait for you.
-My fish are everywhere.

100
00:09:28,882 --> 00:09:30,440
Thank God none died.

101
00:09:57,677 --> 00:09:59,167
Xiang!

102
00:10:00,547 --> 00:10:03,482
Xiang! What are you doing?

103
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,948
-Why do you treat me like this?
-Let go of me!

104
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:08,587
-Why didn't you open the door?
-I have a date.

105
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:10,950
Don't be like this.

106
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:17,457
Let's talk, okay?

107
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,257
Let go of me first.

108
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:23,992
I left work early
just to pick you up.

109
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,662
-Why didn't you wait for me?
-Why did you smash my car?

110
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:29,968
Who are you to tell me
what to do?

111
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,844
You can't treat people like this.
You come and go as you like.

112
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:38,506
That's me! That's my life.

113
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:46,021
-Don't be like this. Forgive me.
-Let go of me.

114
00:10:48,294 --> 00:10:50,353
You're so immature.

115
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,465
You wouldn't love me
if I were mature.

116
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:58,199
Don't take me for a fool.

117
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:18,350
Don't leave me.

118
00:11:34,707 --> 00:11:36,265
What's wrong?

119
00:11:37,877 --> 00:11:41,335
Xiang, what's wrong?

120
00:11:55,595 --> 00:11:57,392
Marry me?

121
00:12:07,073 --> 00:12:08,540
Okay?

122
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:15,546
Why do you always avoid
the subject?

123
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:21,653
Look me in the eyes.
Look at me!

124
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:24,684
Marry me, will you?

125
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:31,690
Give me a straight answer.

126
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:34,161
Or you won't see me again.

127
00:12:35,368 --> 00:12:37,268
Are you threatening me?

128
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:42,707
-I don't like being threatened.
-Yes! I'm threatening you.

129
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:46,334
Don't ask me to pick you up.

130
00:12:46,512 --> 00:12:51,142
Don't call me when you're lonely.
I mean it.

131
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:53,442
You're being childish again.

132
00:12:53,619 --> 00:12:57,680
Don't say that.

133
00:12:58,157 --> 00:13:00,489
Will you marry me?

134
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,991
Okay?

135
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:04,986
-No.
-Marry me!

136
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:08,258
-No.
-Marry me!

137
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:10,061
-No!
-Marry me!

138
00:13:10,236 --> 00:13:11,931
Yes. No.

139
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:08,126
Thank you.

140
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:28,242
<i>Brian Sun! If you have the balls,
come face me!</i>

141
00:15:39,652 --> 00:15:42,917
Here she is! I hear the sound
of money at my door!

142
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:48,493
-You'll call us twins? No way!
-You'll be twins if I say so.

143
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:50,390
This place was hard to find.

144
00:15:50,563 --> 00:15:52,895
Yes, it's a little out of the way.

145
00:15:53,065 --> 00:15:56,034
-This is Jie from Singapore.
-Malaysia.

146
00:15:56,202 --> 00:16:00,400
Right, Malaysia.
This is Tong from Hong Kong.

147
00:16:00,606 --> 00:16:02,198
Hi.

148
00:16:02,475 --> 00:16:05,035
What's with the handshake?

149
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:07,008
Rude!

150
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,705
Sit!

151
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:12,247
Let me see you together.

152
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:23,390
Very little resemblance indeed.

153
00:16:24,197 --> 00:16:29,100
No matter. I'll still present you
as twin sisters.

154
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:33,329
Audiences want
satisfaction nowadays.

155
00:16:33,506 --> 00:16:39,911
lmagine a pair
of singing and dancing twins...

156
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,980
...who can maybe do
some magic tricks.

157
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:46,141
People will just fall over
themselves.

158
00:16:46,986 --> 00:16:49,147
I'm telling you!

159
00:16:49,322 --> 00:16:52,314
This is a world
without boundaries.

160
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:54,425
You're from
two different places.

161
00:16:54,594 --> 00:16:56,892
Your union will be a symbol...

162
00:16:57,063 --> 00:17:01,762
...of the global village.

163
00:17:03,002 --> 00:17:04,970
Who's hot now?

164
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:07,037
-F4
-Yes.

165
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:12,209
And there is Yang Yang.

166
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:17,145
They all have a common appeal.
They make people smile.

167
00:17:17,316 --> 00:17:20,046
They have that
feel-good quality.

168
00:17:20,386 --> 00:17:26,120
Whether you're from Hong Kong,
Taiwan or anywhere else...

169
00:17:26,626 --> 00:17:29,459
...everyone just needs
some simple fun.

170
00:17:29,629 --> 00:17:30,891
Where are you staying?

171
00:17:31,063 --> 00:17:32,928
If their idols
make them feel good....

172
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:35,465
She doesn't even
have a place to stay!

173
00:17:35,635 --> 00:17:38,365
It doesn't matter,
they can't sing or dance.

174
00:17:38,904 --> 00:17:41,498
Sorry about that.

175
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:45,237
-That's okay, I got it.
-Here, let me help.

176
00:17:45,411 --> 00:17:48,380
-I got it.
-Let me help you.

177
00:17:48,547 --> 00:17:50,412
-It's heavy.
-It's okay.

178
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,244
You've got it?

179
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:57,686
-Where's the hotel?
-Not far. Let's take the bus.

180
00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:05,063
Sit anywhere.

181
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:20,709
Can I use your closet?

182
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:23,774
-Sure, why not?
-Thanks.

183
00:18:24,216 --> 00:18:26,480
I've never been to Malaysia.

184
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,888
I'm from Alor Setar.

185
00:18:30,056 --> 00:18:32,354
It's small but beautiful.

186
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:35,250
How come you speak Cantonese?

187
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:37,019
I learned it by watching movies.

188
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:41,063
We have lots of Cantonese movies
and a lot of Canto-pop music.

189
00:18:42,635 --> 00:18:44,364
What time
are our lessons tomorrow?

190
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:53,809
Don't we have to learn
lots of things?

191
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:57,073
-Singing. Dancing.
-Yeah.

192
00:18:57,249 --> 00:18:58,876
I'm really nervous.

193
00:19:06,092 --> 00:19:08,322
Forget about it. It'll dry.

194
00:19:09,528 --> 00:19:11,496
Let me clean it up anyway.

195
00:19:16,168 --> 00:19:18,932
-What's happening?
-What?

196
00:19:19,372 --> 00:19:22,364
-What's going on?
-Earthquake.

197
00:20:01,347 --> 00:20:04,612
Earthquake! Are you scared?

198
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:14,692
Thank you for the interview.

199
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,725
Excuse me. This lady.
May I ask...?

200
00:20:16,896 --> 00:20:20,093
Excuse me, madam.
Madam, may l...?

201
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:22,257
I'm sorry. I know nothing.

202
00:20:22,435 --> 00:20:26,337
Another earthquake!
What do you feel?

203
00:20:26,906 --> 00:20:30,865
Can I ask a question? It'll
just take a couple of minutes.

204
00:20:31,143 --> 00:20:33,202
Please. It's just an interview.

205
00:20:40,953 --> 00:20:42,921
Jie! We're on TV!

206
00:20:43,088 --> 00:20:44,646
What?

207
00:20:50,996 --> 00:20:54,295
I want to record it for my mother.
I have a digital video camera.

208
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:56,264
<i>No earthquakes in Hong Kong,
right?</i>

209
00:20:56,435 --> 00:21:00,428
<i>No, but we have typhoons.</i>

210
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:05,232
<i>-Yes, typhoons.
-So this is your first earthquake?</i>

211
00:21:05,578 --> 00:21:07,842
<i>Yes, it was pretty scary.</i>

212
00:21:08,013 --> 00:21:10,345
<i>We don't have earthquakes
in Malaysia.</i>

213
00:21:10,516 --> 00:21:13,246
<i>At first I was scared,
but I'm okay now.</i>

214
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:23,161
Mom, I was on TV.

215
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:26,196
<i>-I taped it for you.
-Are you okay?</i>

216
00:21:26,365 --> 00:21:29,801
<i>-Everything is fine. How are you?
-I'm worried about you over there.</i>

217
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:32,699
<i>-I'm living with a girl.
-Take care of yourself.</i>

218
00:21:32,872 --> 00:21:36,501
<i>We're worried sick
about you being away.</i>

219
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:41,203
<i>Dad is really upset.
I'm putting in a good word for you.</i>

220
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,439
I know.

221
00:21:43,749 --> 00:21:45,182
<i>Please come home soon....</i>

222
00:21:45,351 --> 00:21:47,842
This call is expensive.
I must go.

223
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,012
<i>-Keep in touch!
-Okay.</i>

224
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:03,928
The flowers. Oh, my God!

225
00:22:05,738 --> 00:22:08,571
Nothing seems to be broken.

226
00:22:24,757 --> 00:22:27,783
Hey! I was terrified last night.

227
00:22:27,993 --> 00:22:31,759
I was on the subway,
and it felt like a roller coaster.

228
00:22:31,931 --> 00:22:33,660
Okay, let's get on and clean up.

229
00:22:33,832 --> 00:22:38,235
-At least nothing's broken.
-Yeah, clean them up.

230
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:39,837
Yes.

231
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,571
Mrs. Zhao, I need the day off.
My father had a heart attack.

232
00:22:44,743 --> 00:22:46,677
I need to go to the hospital.

233
00:22:47,913 --> 00:22:50,313
-Add some more of these.
-Okay.

234
00:22:50,482 --> 00:22:52,712
Our glass door was shattered.

235
00:22:52,885 --> 00:22:54,876
We were pretty lucky here.

236
00:22:55,054 --> 00:22:57,022
-Just a few broken pots.
-I'll say.

237
00:22:57,189 --> 00:23:00,784
-Hello. Love Home Florist.
-With some more white daisies.

238
00:23:02,428 --> 00:23:03,952
What's the matter?

239
00:23:04,163 --> 00:23:07,462
My mother fell from a window.

240
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:09,760
-What? Which floor was she on?
-The second.

241
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:12,631
-I'm going to the hospital.
-The second isn't too bad.

242
00:23:12,805 --> 00:23:16,571
Don't worry. Will you be back?
She won't call.

243
00:23:16,742 --> 00:23:18,801
Hello! Love Home Hospital.

244
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:22,104
Love Home Florist.

245
00:23:22,715 --> 00:23:26,082
The flowers will be delivered
on time.

246
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:10,053
What are you doing?
This street's one-way!

247
00:24:10,262 --> 00:24:12,730
Sorry, sorry.

248
00:24:13,699 --> 00:24:17,100
Patience, patience.

249
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:25,508
-Yes?
-For Mr. and Mrs. Zhao.

250
00:24:25,678 --> 00:24:27,771
-Yes.
-Anniversary.

251
00:24:27,946 --> 00:24:29,345
Okay, thank you.

252
00:24:29,515 --> 00:24:33,042
-Where shall I put these?
-Over there.

253
00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:24,061
-Twelve, 1 1 , 1 0, 9...
-Twelve, 1 1 , 1 0, 9...

254
00:25:24,403 --> 00:25:28,362
-...8, 7, 6, go!
-...8, 7, 6, go!

255
00:25:58,237 --> 00:26:01,001
-Hey!
-What?

256
00:26:01,173 --> 00:26:02,504
-That's my idol!
-Who?

257
00:26:02,674 --> 00:26:04,073
-Qi Yu.
-Who's Qi Yu?

258
00:26:04,243 --> 00:26:07,076
She sings ''Olive Tree''
and ''Walk in the Rain.''

259
00:26:07,913 --> 00:26:10,177
I know her!
Let's get an autograph.

260
00:26:10,349 --> 00:26:13,284
-Where's my notebook?
-Got any paper?

261
00:26:14,086 --> 00:26:16,384
Got it. Here, here.

262
00:26:19,258 --> 00:26:21,920
Qi Yu. Miss Qi Yu.

263
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:24,687
-Hi!
-Could I get your autograph?

264
00:26:25,898 --> 00:26:28,423
-I love your music.
-Me too!

265
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,659
The first album I bought
was yours.

266
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:35,170
-Really?
-Yes. Thank you.

267
00:26:47,653 --> 00:26:51,680
-He looks cheesy.
-I think he's good-looking.

268
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,915
-That's my type.
-A real hunk.

269
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:57,323
It's not how they look.

270
00:26:57,496 --> 00:26:58,963
Take Shi Ge.

271
00:26:59,164 --> 00:27:02,190
It's what's inside that counts.

272
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:04,699
So you know what's inside
Shi Ge?

273
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:09,136
-Real talent.
-Crazy girls.

274
00:27:13,245 --> 00:27:15,839
The guys I like don't like me.

275
00:27:16,014 --> 00:27:18,039
Those I don't like
always go for me.

276
00:27:18,217 --> 00:27:20,811
When I'm famous,
I'll marry Tony Leung.

277
00:27:20,986 --> 00:27:22,351
He'll leave his girlfriend?

278
00:27:22,521 --> 00:27:25,854
-I am younger than her.
-He'll be old by then.

279
00:27:26,058 --> 00:27:28,526
Doesn't matter,
I still love him.

280
00:27:29,661 --> 00:27:32,391
Do you have a girlfriend,
Shi Ge?

281
00:27:32,564 --> 00:27:35,328
What's it to you? Of course.

282
00:27:38,437 --> 00:27:40,098
Is she from Hong Kong?

283
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:42,339
Is she a pop star?

284
00:27:42,774 --> 00:27:46,471
-She's an ordinary person.
-Do we know her?

285
00:27:47,045 --> 00:27:48,603
No, she's not famous.

286
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:52,739
-Then how do you know her?
-How?

287
00:27:53,185 --> 00:27:56,712
She has a beautiful voice.

288
00:27:56,889 --> 00:27:59,380
She's pretty, with long hair.

289
00:28:00,893 --> 00:28:05,296
I wrote songs for her,
but it's no good.

290
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:08,060
She's married,
so, what's the point?

291
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:10,497
Wow, he's in love!

292
00:28:11,036 --> 00:28:14,802
You guys are crazy.

293
00:28:14,973 --> 00:28:17,567
Get out. You're distracting me.

294
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:22,237
-When do we start working?
-We can't start without a song.

295
00:28:22,414 --> 00:28:26,510
I'm writing one.
Get out and practice.

296
00:28:26,685 --> 00:28:30,314
-Practice, practice, practice.
-Go away.

297
00:28:30,522 --> 00:28:32,490
We're off to practice.

298
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:43,261
I have five brothers and sisters.
I'm the oldest.

299
00:28:43,435 --> 00:28:45,369
My father works
on a rubber plantation.

300
00:28:45,537 --> 00:28:47,402
My mother stays home
and cares for us.

301
00:28:47,773 --> 00:28:50,936
My dad and I support
the family...

302
00:28:52,144 --> 00:28:54,305
...so this is my last chance.

303
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:58,882
If this doesn't work, I'll have
to go back to a boring job.

304
00:28:59,051 --> 00:29:02,885
A clerk, maybe, or a salesgirl.

305
00:29:03,055 --> 00:29:05,615
Do you really love
to sing and dance?

306
00:29:05,824 --> 00:29:07,451
I love singing the most.

307
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:11,652
At least it's something
you want to do.

308
00:29:12,764 --> 00:29:14,391
What about you?

309
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:17,197
Isn't there something
you want to do?

310
00:29:17,636 --> 00:29:19,001
Me?

311
00:29:25,577 --> 00:29:28,171
I didn't want to tell you...

312
00:29:29,114 --> 00:29:31,412
...but suddenly
I feel like saying it.

313
00:29:32,217 --> 00:29:34,151
Are you listening?

314
00:29:38,323 --> 00:29:41,486
My mother is having an affair.

315
00:29:44,863 --> 00:29:49,766
I need to know what he's like
and how he could...

316
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:54,431
...turn my mother away from my dad.

317
00:29:59,044 --> 00:30:01,979
-Have you ever been in love?
-Me?

318
00:30:03,749 --> 00:30:05,808
I had a boyfriend once.

319
00:30:06,284 --> 00:30:10,516
I don't think it was love.

320
00:30:10,756 --> 00:30:13,088
Isn't it the same thing?

321
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:17,557
How is it different? If you
want to be with him, it's love.

322
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,498
Why would you dump someone
you like?

323
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,033
Why didn't you come out
that day?

324
00:30:28,073 --> 00:30:31,406
You didn't even answer my call.
I waited for you downstairs.

325
00:30:34,212 --> 00:30:36,806
I know you were home.

326
00:30:43,922 --> 00:30:46,413
Are you mad at me?

327
00:30:52,197 --> 00:30:54,290
Is your wife away on business?

328
00:30:58,236 --> 00:30:59,863
She's in Beijing.

329
00:31:04,409 --> 00:31:07,173
I thought we agreed
not to complain.

330
00:31:14,286 --> 00:31:15,878
Sorry.

331
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:24,453
I'm flying to Europe this time.

332
00:31:25,897 --> 00:31:28,388
Let's think about this thing
between us.

333
00:31:30,702 --> 00:31:33,637
We need to make up our minds.

334
00:31:37,776 --> 00:31:39,869
You said there'd be
no strings attached.

335
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:43,508
I am not attaching strings.

336
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:50,449
I'm just not sure
I love you anymore.

337
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:58,129
I have to go.

338
00:32:17,782 --> 00:32:19,909
We're all old friends.

339
00:32:20,085 --> 00:32:22,576
I really don't know
how to do this.

340
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:27,421
I hope you can cool down
for a while and reconsider.

341
00:32:30,562 --> 00:32:32,860
Thank you for the advice.

342
00:32:41,373 --> 00:32:46,743
Lily, I didn't want a divorce.

343
00:32:50,448 --> 00:32:51,779
Your keys!

344
00:33:39,264 --> 00:33:43,564
Mommy, why do you
want a divorce?

345
00:33:46,471 --> 00:33:49,634
You'll understand
when you get older.

346
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,544
Men can't be relied upon.

347
00:33:53,712 --> 00:33:55,873
We can get by just fine
without them.

348
00:33:56,047 --> 00:33:57,537
Do you have any savings?

349
00:33:57,849 --> 00:34:01,410
Don't forget about alimony.

350
00:34:01,586 --> 00:34:04,111
It's hard to find someone
at 40-something.

351
00:34:04,322 --> 00:34:07,780
When you do, you don't want them.

352
00:34:08,193 --> 00:34:09,717
Why not?

353
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,891
If he's good, then why not?

354
00:34:19,704 --> 00:34:21,831
Bottoms up, down in one!

355
00:34:22,007 --> 00:34:26,376
Peter. Peter! One, 2, 3!

356
00:35:48,827 --> 00:35:51,295
Time to eat!

357
00:35:53,331 --> 00:35:55,026
Time to eat.

358
00:35:58,703 --> 00:36:00,568
Are you feeling better today?

359
00:36:08,546 --> 00:36:10,776
Linda, Grandma's winning!

360
00:36:10,949 --> 00:36:12,644
You bet.

361
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,412
You can talk to her.

362
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,649
She likes being talked to.

363
00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:22,258
She can hear you.

364
00:36:22,427 --> 00:36:25,453
Try reading the newspaper
to her.

365
00:36:25,663 --> 00:36:27,187
She likes that.

366
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:29,162
She looks just fine.

367
00:36:30,468 --> 00:36:33,699
''A minor flat to E major.

368
00:36:33,872 --> 00:36:39,003
It tries to express the idea
that we exist in our memories.

369
00:36:39,244 --> 00:36:42,509
From a baby staring at a mirror...

370
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,707
...to when we start to observe
ourselves in mirrors.''

371
00:36:50,789 --> 00:36:52,552
Are you listening?

372
00:37:03,435 --> 00:37:04,993
My name is Lily.

373
00:37:06,271 --> 00:37:08,136
I have a daughter.

374
00:37:10,442 --> 00:37:12,774
I'm recently divorced.

375
00:37:13,611 --> 00:37:15,476
Have you been married?

376
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:18,878
Do you have family?

377
00:37:19,451 --> 00:37:21,544
Do they come to visit you?

378
00:37:25,256 --> 00:37:26,985
Can you hear me?

379
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:03,190
What? Just a second.

380
00:38:05,763 --> 00:38:09,358
Jack? What did you say?

381
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,804
Married? But you told me....

382
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:20,043
We agreed
we'd never marry anyone.

383
00:38:23,681 --> 00:38:26,172
Do you realize what you've done?

384
00:38:26,651 --> 00:38:30,883
It's pouring, and I can't find a cab.
I can't get home.

385
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:32,747
I'm cold.

386
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:38,554
Don't call me again.

387
00:38:41,266 --> 00:38:44,429
Who will I call
when I need someone?

388
00:38:44,903 --> 00:38:47,167
I knew this would happen.

389
00:38:51,643 --> 00:38:54,009
<i>Hello? Xiang?</i>

390
00:38:54,812 --> 00:38:56,336
<i>Are you there?</i>

391
00:38:57,749 --> 00:38:59,478
<i>Hello?</i>

392
00:39:05,023 --> 00:39:06,718
<i>Xiang.</i>

393
00:39:53,504 --> 00:39:56,598
Mom, why do I have to
study piano?

394
00:39:56,774 --> 00:40:00,608
A girl needs a backup.

395
00:40:00,812 --> 00:40:02,643
If your husband
ever leaves you...

396
00:40:03,214 --> 00:40:05,774
...you can teach piano
to support yourself.

397
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:10,580
-But why would he leave me?
-Who knows?

398
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:14,058
At least you'll be prepared.

399
00:40:16,928 --> 00:40:18,452
Carry on!

400
00:40:42,286 --> 00:40:45,778
I'm dying.

401
00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:49,989
I am dying.

402
00:40:52,497 --> 00:40:55,557
No one will care if I'm dead.

403
00:40:57,802 --> 00:41:01,238
I am going to die.

404
00:41:07,145 --> 00:41:09,045
I am dead.

405
00:41:13,551 --> 00:41:16,952
I'll marry the next guy
who knocks.

406
00:42:13,144 --> 00:42:16,978
Lots of people
are interested in your piano.

407
00:42:17,148 --> 00:42:21,050
-Are you really going to sell it?
-I want to sell everything.

408
00:42:21,219 --> 00:42:23,744
I want to sell myself too.

409
00:42:24,155 --> 00:42:29,252
This guy is looking for a piano
as a gift for his daughter.

410
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,954
Whatever. If my mother found out,
she'd turn over in her grave.

411
00:42:34,165 --> 00:42:36,065
-Show me that one.
-Okay.

412
00:42:36,234 --> 00:42:38,725
-That one.
-This one?

413
00:42:42,206 --> 00:42:45,903
They're all black.
Going to a funeral?

414
00:42:46,644 --> 00:42:48,111
This one?

415
00:42:48,312 --> 00:42:50,906
No, that one.

416
00:42:51,249 --> 00:42:55,310
Which one?
Are you going to Ying's wedding?

417
00:42:57,655 --> 00:43:00,852
It's not me getting married.
Why bother?

418
00:43:07,632 --> 00:43:13,901
So expensive.
I can't wear them all.

419
00:43:30,855 --> 00:43:32,254
Hi.

420
00:43:33,357 --> 00:43:37,453
I'm packing.
I'm about to leave.

421
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:42,966
Okay, get on with your surgery.
Bye.

422
00:43:52,243 --> 00:43:56,577
Hey, Qi, I'm packing.

423
00:43:57,481 --> 00:43:59,278
I'm about to leave.

424
00:43:59,984 --> 00:44:03,545
Get on with your
recording session. Bye.

425
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:11,623
Hello, Jack. I'm packing.

426
00:44:11,796 --> 00:44:13,559
I'm about to leave.

427
00:44:13,731 --> 00:44:15,631
Shit!

428
00:44:24,075 --> 00:44:26,839
Why did you buy a tape recorder?

429
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,309
I want to record my own stuff.

430
00:44:30,481 --> 00:44:34,383
Maybe a new song, a phrase...

431
00:44:34,552 --> 00:44:38,955
...the sounds of Taipei
and your voice babbling.

432
00:44:39,924 --> 00:44:42,518
This is my 20th day in Taipei.
Taipei's a big city.

433
00:44:42,727 --> 00:44:46,219
-What are you saying?
-Quiet! Don't talk behind my back.

434
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:49,957
I have a fat, ugly friend,
and she babbles on every day.

435
00:44:50,134 --> 00:44:52,432
How dare you say I'm ugly!

436
00:44:52,603 --> 00:44:55,367
I'm babbling, not ugly.

437
00:44:56,407 --> 00:44:58,705
She does love to talk.

438
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,635
I'm really happy.

439
00:45:01,812 --> 00:45:04,372
So no problem.
I'll just wait.

440
00:45:04,548 --> 00:45:07,346
We haven't started training,
let alone performing.

441
00:45:07,518 --> 00:45:11,682
-What are you saying?
-I'm badmouthing you!

442
00:45:44,188 --> 00:45:46,520
Have you ever kissed a girl?

443
00:45:47,925 --> 00:45:49,358
Have you?

444
00:45:49,894 --> 00:45:52,863
-I haven't!
-Me neither.

445
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:55,894
In my school,
lots of girls like girls.

446
00:45:56,067 --> 00:45:58,092
Same here.

447
00:46:00,571 --> 00:46:04,598
Do all Malaysian girls
sleep in their bras?

448
00:46:04,775 --> 00:46:07,938
You! So, what do you call this?

449
00:46:10,214 --> 00:46:13,081
Why are you so scared when l...?

450
00:47:18,949 --> 00:47:21,747
How do you know those old songs?

451
00:47:22,586 --> 00:47:24,554
I learned them from my mother.

452
00:47:24,722 --> 00:47:27,953
She knows a lot of old songs.

453
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:30,218
She has a great voice.

454
00:47:30,428 --> 00:47:32,020
You don't know these songs?

455
00:49:55,539 --> 00:49:57,200
Why am I here?

456
00:50:00,277 --> 00:50:02,541
What am I looking for?

457
00:50:17,094 --> 00:50:19,255
Oh, my God!

458
00:50:27,137 --> 00:50:30,504
So the long weekend's coming.
Any plans?

459
00:50:30,674 --> 00:50:32,403
Maybe the hot springs
with my man.

460
00:50:32,576 --> 00:50:34,976
-Great!
-We're going to the lake.

461
00:50:35,145 --> 00:50:39,138
-Really? Look, how's this?
-Not bad at all.

462
00:50:39,316 --> 00:50:41,716
-Okay, that's decided, then.
-Thanks.

463
00:50:41,885 --> 00:50:45,582
Guess what! I'm going to the
East Coast with my boyfriend.

464
00:50:45,789 --> 00:50:49,190
-I'm really looking forward to it!
-Bring me back a souvenir.

465
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,828
-Me too.
-Do these go together?

466
00:50:51,996 --> 00:50:53,759
Sure! Let's see
how to arrange them.

467
00:50:53,931 --> 00:50:56,365
Where are you
and your husband going?

468
00:51:01,705 --> 00:51:05,300
James? This is Lily.

469
00:51:05,909 --> 00:51:09,777
You're still here! I figured
you'd be gone for the weekend.

470
00:51:10,581 --> 00:51:14,449
What? You're in Bangkok! Sorry!

471
00:51:14,618 --> 00:51:16,848
Hello. Is Mr. Wu there?

472
00:51:17,321 --> 00:51:18,982
This is....

473
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:21,050
Who's this?

474
00:51:21,759 --> 00:51:26,526
Oh! Mrs. Wu.
Please tell him...

475
00:51:26,697 --> 00:51:30,326
...Ms. Shi called
from Citibank.

476
00:51:30,501 --> 00:51:33,834
Hi, Fred. This is Lily.

477
00:51:34,872 --> 00:51:36,533
Hello. Lu Yi-zheng.

478
00:51:36,707 --> 00:51:38,572
We were in elementary school
together.

479
00:51:38,742 --> 00:51:42,234
Lily Shi.
Are you free this weekend?

480
00:51:42,413 --> 00:51:44,404
Hello. Mr. Wang.

481
00:51:44,948 --> 00:51:50,011
Mr. Wang,
can you show me some apartments?

482
00:51:51,689 --> 00:51:53,520
You've changed jobs?

483
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:57,984
May I ask what you're doing now?

484
00:51:59,697 --> 00:52:01,528
You're teaching tennis?

485
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:04,329
You're teaching tennis.

486
00:52:05,969 --> 00:52:08,301
Tennis. Well, that's fine too.

487
00:52:08,605 --> 00:52:10,630
Let's start. Watch the ball.

488
00:52:12,009 --> 00:52:13,567
It's all right. Again.

489
00:52:17,981 --> 00:52:20,882
This is tennis, not dodge ball.

490
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:23,679
Hit the ball,
don't hide from it.

491
00:52:23,854 --> 00:52:26,414
Hold the racket a little lower.

492
00:52:26,623 --> 00:52:29,820
Turn the handle back a little.
Hold tight.

493
00:52:30,027 --> 00:52:32,018
You'll gain more strength.

494
00:52:32,229 --> 00:52:36,996
Swing like this.
Swing through your shoulder.

495
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:41,069
Same with your backhand.
Follow through smoothly.

496
00:52:41,271 --> 00:52:43,068
What's with the backhand?

497
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:47,870
Grip tight with both hands. Stare
in the direction of the ball.

498
00:52:48,045 --> 00:52:51,014
Swing back through
your shoulder.

499
00:52:51,181 --> 00:52:53,240
Loosen up the shoulder a bit.

500
00:52:53,417 --> 00:52:55,851
-Look at the ball. Try this.
-Okay.

501
00:52:57,921 --> 00:52:59,513
Good.

502
00:52:59,823 --> 00:53:02,223
-Right?
-Look at the ball, not at me.

503
00:53:05,396 --> 00:53:07,227
Good, good!

504
00:53:31,455 --> 00:53:34,947
Hey, you don't look your age.

505
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,895
Go, go, go.

506
00:53:49,239 --> 00:53:51,207
Move both your hands. Backhand.

507
00:53:53,076 --> 00:53:55,408
Forehand. To the front.

508
00:54:00,484 --> 00:54:03,612
Lily, come on.

509
00:54:06,123 --> 00:54:08,318
Are you doing okay?

510
00:54:18,802 --> 00:54:22,329
Lily, get up. Exercise time.

511
00:54:22,506 --> 00:54:24,940
Hurry! Wake up. Wake up.

512
00:54:25,108 --> 00:54:28,544
Get up and exercise.

513
00:54:28,712 --> 00:54:30,270
Come on!

514
00:54:32,015 --> 00:54:35,451
Off the bed. Come on!

515
00:54:35,853 --> 00:54:38,344
Move, move. Come on!

516
00:54:43,794 --> 00:54:45,318
Come on! Come on!

517
00:54:51,034 --> 00:54:53,002
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

518
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:57,368
Up, up! You're fine!
Come on. Almost there.

519
00:55:51,428 --> 00:55:53,225
Lily, my dear.

520
00:55:53,397 --> 00:55:56,161
No more, no more. I beg you.

521
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:58,460
The more you resist
the more excited I get.

522
00:55:58,635 --> 00:56:02,366
Please, I really can't.

523
00:56:02,539 --> 00:56:04,837
-Lily! Come on.
-I'm begging you.

524
00:56:05,008 --> 00:56:07,476
Really, no more.

525
00:56:08,779 --> 00:56:10,679
No more.

526
00:56:12,015 --> 00:56:13,710
Lily.

527
00:56:18,388 --> 00:56:22,449
-Lily, come on. Don't run!
-I really can't!

528
00:56:34,304 --> 00:56:38,570
You won't find twin girls
in Taiwan...

529
00:56:38,742 --> 00:56:42,508
-...half as talented as mine.
-No kidding?

530
00:56:42,679 --> 00:56:46,979
The big labels approached me,
but I'm holding back.

531
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:51,348
The majors, you name it.
I'm not doing business with them.

532
00:56:51,521 --> 00:56:54,081
Why's that?

533
00:56:54,291 --> 00:56:55,690
Why, you ask?

534
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:00,562
Hello? Hi, sweetheart.

535
00:57:01,198 --> 00:57:03,792
What's the time there?
You're still up?

536
00:57:03,967 --> 00:57:07,198
You should be in bed by now.

537
00:57:07,704 --> 00:57:11,333
Mommy's having lunch
with friends.

538
00:57:11,508 --> 00:57:15,035
It's noisy.
No, you don't know them.

539
00:57:15,212 --> 00:57:18,079
They're all new friends.

540
00:57:20,283 --> 00:57:22,080
You don't know them.

541
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:28,285
I've been busy playing tennis,
and dancing and hiking too.

542
00:57:29,493 --> 00:57:32,690
Skiing? Sure you can go skiing.

543
00:57:32,863 --> 00:57:37,129
So you won't be back
for Christmas?

544
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,235
No problem, you go skiing.

545
00:57:40,504 --> 00:57:42,404
There will be lots
of parties here.

546
00:57:42,572 --> 00:57:45,837
Maybe I'll go away
with friends.

547
00:57:47,077 --> 00:57:52,379
Sandy, you have to call Daddy.

548
00:57:53,316 --> 00:57:56,581
Mommy misses you.

549
00:57:57,554 --> 00:58:01,115
Okay. Take care. Bye!

550
00:58:02,492 --> 00:58:03,959
Bye!

551
00:58:06,763 --> 00:58:11,791
I want them to be this generation's
new pop idols.

552
00:58:11,968 --> 00:58:14,402
Good for you!

553
00:58:14,571 --> 00:58:16,903
Hello?
I'm in a meeting.

554
00:58:17,074 --> 00:58:20,771
Get on with your practicing, then.
Bye!

555
00:58:21,445 --> 00:58:24,778
See how dedicated they are?

556
00:58:24,948 --> 00:58:28,577
Do you want to book them
for a concert?

557
00:58:31,021 --> 00:58:35,458
''The law is inadequate
in protecting the elderly at home.

558
00:58:36,093 --> 00:58:37,583
Although....''

559
00:58:39,563 --> 00:58:41,793
This is all about...

560
00:58:42,566 --> 00:58:46,866
...the aged.

561
00:58:48,338 --> 00:58:51,136
There is nothing else in here!

562
00:58:55,846 --> 00:58:58,815
Let's not read anymore, okay?

563
00:58:59,683 --> 00:59:01,651
No more news.

564
00:59:02,753 --> 00:59:08,089
How about I trim your nails?

565
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:11,220
They're really long!

566
00:59:11,728 --> 00:59:15,664
I've got clippers here.
Let me trim your nails.

567
00:59:18,034 --> 00:59:20,502
I used to cut
my daughter's nails.

568
00:59:26,143 --> 00:59:30,671
But one year,
when she turned 1 2...

569
00:59:31,915 --> 00:59:34,281
...she started to do it herself.

570
00:59:35,185 --> 00:59:39,747
She hasn't needed me much
since then.

571
00:59:43,026 --> 00:59:46,826
Children grow up and leave.

572
00:59:48,298 --> 00:59:52,496
Parents age and go away.

573
00:59:55,372 --> 00:59:57,306
Men go away too.

574
01:00:00,911 --> 01:00:02,776
Good thing they do.

575
01:00:04,347 --> 01:00:06,747
Otherwise, I wouldn't
have met you.

576
01:00:11,855 --> 01:00:13,379
Right?

577
01:00:15,392 --> 01:00:18,623
Let's hear it
for the Sunday Sisters.

578
01:00:18,795 --> 01:00:22,026
Next up are Cindy and Candy.

579
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:25,631
Hey, who are you?

580
01:00:26,469 --> 01:00:29,097
Who invited you?
Why did you sing so many songs?

581
01:00:29,272 --> 01:00:30,933
Who the hell are you?

582
01:00:31,107 --> 01:00:33,302
What's your problem!
You know who I am?

583
01:00:33,476 --> 01:00:36,445
-Who cares? You're an asshole.
-Are you crazy?

584
01:00:36,613 --> 01:00:38,376
Crazy? I'm defending you here.

585
01:00:39,049 --> 01:00:41,244
Why are you so mad?
What's with you?

586
01:00:41,418 --> 01:00:44,012
I defend you, and you yell at me?
You're crazy!

587
01:00:44,187 --> 01:00:47,247
I'm crazy? You never think
of people's feelings.

588
01:00:47,457 --> 01:00:50,426
-I have feelings too!
-Have you finished?

589
01:00:50,594 --> 01:00:52,255
-Stay out of this.
-What is it?

590
01:00:52,462 --> 01:00:53,895
-Stop it!
-Who are you?

591
01:00:54,064 --> 01:00:58,364
-I'm their manager. Talk to me.
-Manager? From where?

592
01:00:58,535 --> 01:01:00,696
We're just starting out.

593
01:01:00,871 --> 01:01:03,499
-That figures.
-Shut up. What's it to you?

594
01:01:03,673 --> 01:01:06,904
-Pipe down.
-Stop it. Quiet, please.

595
01:01:07,077 --> 01:01:08,908
Did I give permission
to go on-stage?

596
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:11,411
-You're crazy.
-You're nuts.

597
01:01:12,082 --> 01:01:15,279
-Excuse me, what did you say?
-Why didn't you get my permission?

598
01:01:15,452 --> 01:01:18,717
-Why do I need your permission?
-Don't you know who I am?

599
01:01:19,256 --> 01:01:20,951
No!

600
01:01:21,992 --> 01:01:24,552
His dad is the principal.

601
01:01:27,497 --> 01:01:29,488
Get out, you guys. Get out.

602
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:32,827
-Get out.
-Wait outside.

603
01:01:33,003 --> 01:01:34,664
-Nut case.
-I'm sorry.

604
01:01:34,838 --> 01:01:37,136
-They're an ignorant bunch!
-They're new.

605
01:01:37,307 --> 01:01:40,401
-They were very rude.
-You're right. Damn ignorant.

606
01:01:40,577 --> 01:01:45,981
-And rude.
-Forgive them. I apologize!

607
01:02:06,937 --> 01:02:08,461
Sorry!

608
01:02:11,775 --> 01:02:14,266
We must have been terrible
up there.

609
01:02:14,444 --> 01:02:19,438
No way.
We Sunday Sisters top everyone.

610
01:02:51,982 --> 01:02:54,212
What is the bravest thing
you've done?

611
01:02:54,384 --> 01:02:58,753
-Me? Milking a cow.
-Milking a cow? I'm serious!

612
01:02:58,922 --> 01:03:04,690
That cow kicked someone to death.
No one dared milk her.

613
01:03:05,628 --> 01:03:07,926
So do you dare make love to me?

614
01:03:30,286 --> 01:03:31,810
There's no one here.

615
01:03:34,724 --> 01:03:36,453
It's dirty.

616
01:03:38,928 --> 01:03:40,623
Very dirty.

617
01:03:40,797 --> 01:03:42,628
This one is nicer.

618
01:03:43,533 --> 01:03:46,127
Maybe every stall is different.

619
01:03:48,471 --> 01:03:51,201
What? Why are you laughing?

620
01:03:52,509 --> 01:03:54,841
Why are you laughing?

621
01:03:56,146 --> 01:03:58,580
What's so funny?

622
01:04:55,238 --> 01:04:58,264
What? What?!

623
01:05:06,449 --> 01:05:08,246
Check her out.

624
01:05:12,388 --> 01:05:15,323
It's the girl we met
this morning.

625
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,991
-Hey.
-What do you want?

626
01:05:27,337 --> 01:05:29,931
-Where's your friend?
-Mind your own business!

627
01:05:30,106 --> 01:05:32,040
-Let's call it a truce.
-No.

628
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:34,472
-Come on.
-No.

629
01:05:34,644 --> 01:05:37,636
You have a pen? A pen.

630
01:05:39,749 --> 01:05:42,650
-What do you want?
-Can I give you my number?

631
01:05:42,819 --> 01:05:47,313
Call me and we'll go out sometime.
Okay?

632
01:05:51,661 --> 01:05:53,925
It's all right. Just a kid.

633
01:05:54,764 --> 01:05:56,732
Don't worry.

634
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,233
May I sit with you?

635
01:06:26,729 --> 01:06:31,632
Put this up for me.
Yes, right up there.

636
01:06:31,935 --> 01:06:35,962
-This side. Put it here.
-Do it yourself!

637
01:06:36,139 --> 01:06:40,974
You're taller. Help me!
Higher up. Thank you.

638
01:06:51,221 --> 01:06:52,586
Xiang!

639
01:06:53,856 --> 01:06:56,689
Listen to me.

640
01:07:01,231 --> 01:07:02,664
Xiang.

641
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:19,448
Don't act like this.

642
01:07:19,616 --> 01:07:21,379
-Leave me alone!
-No. Xiang!

643
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:30,149
Be careful!

644
01:07:34,731 --> 01:07:37,063
What's going on?

645
01:07:37,567 --> 01:07:39,694
Come help rescue my fish.

646
01:07:41,204 --> 01:07:42,728
Can you see that one?

647
01:07:43,573 --> 01:07:45,336
You're standing on it!

648
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:48,036
There's one over there.

649
01:07:48,678 --> 01:07:51,340
Be careful. Don't squash it.

650
01:07:52,148 --> 01:07:53,979
There's another one!

651
01:07:58,421 --> 01:08:01,720
-Give it to me. Qi, give me.
-Be careful.

652
01:08:10,233 --> 01:08:12,224
What are you two doing?

653
01:08:13,569 --> 01:08:15,161
Catch it!

654
01:08:19,776 --> 01:08:22,074
-Hello.
-Who's this guy?

655
01:08:24,147 --> 01:08:27,810
-This is ridiculous.
-How should I know who he is?

656
01:08:27,984 --> 01:08:29,849
Who are you?

657
01:08:30,553 --> 01:08:33,681
-What's it to you?
-What kind of game is this?

658
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:36,586
-This is too much.
-You have no right to question me.

659
01:08:36,793 --> 01:08:41,890
Nor do you. You think I don't know
what you and May were doing?

660
01:08:42,065 --> 01:08:44,295
-It's all crap.
-May asked for my help.

661
01:08:44,467 --> 01:08:46,367
-I did nothing!
-Of course she asked.

662
01:08:46,536 --> 01:08:49,004
And you do whatever she wants?

663
01:08:49,572 --> 01:08:51,301
Right?

664
01:08:51,507 --> 01:08:54,271
-You have no right to lecture me.
-Don't act like this.

665
01:08:54,444 --> 01:08:55,843
Don't touch me.

666
01:08:56,012 --> 01:09:00,108
I need to get a new fishbowl.
Close the door when you leave.

667
01:09:18,468 --> 01:09:20,766
Who are you?

668
01:09:20,937 --> 01:09:23,633
I'm Situ.
I've come for the piano.

669
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:29,268
-Sorry, today isn't a good day.
-I can see that. Another time?

670
01:09:38,955 --> 01:09:40,820
<i>I have to stop flying...</i>

671
01:09:42,125 --> 01:09:44,218
<i>...change my numbers...</i>

672
01:09:44,427 --> 01:09:46,327
<i>...and disappear
from this world.</i>

673
01:09:59,308 --> 01:10:01,003
Look over there.

674
01:10:01,177 --> 01:10:04,476
Check out the one in gray.
He's looking over here.

675
01:10:04,647 --> 01:10:06,512
Behave yourself, girl!

676
01:10:06,682 --> 01:10:09,776
I looked at the same man for 30 years.
Now there are new ones.

677
01:10:09,952 --> 01:10:14,013
-Why shouldn't I stare?
-Don't just look, do something.

678
01:10:14,223 --> 01:10:17,192
Go for it, Lily!

679
01:10:18,594 --> 01:10:22,121
-All talk, no action?
-Calm down.

680
01:10:23,866 --> 01:10:26,562
Oh, my God, she's going for it!
She's fearless!

681
01:10:26,736 --> 01:10:28,670
She won't give up!

682
01:10:30,273 --> 01:10:32,264
Yes, here's the sauna.

683
01:10:33,176 --> 01:10:35,235
-Hi.
-Hello.

684
01:10:35,411 --> 01:10:38,812
Excuse me,
I just told my friends...

685
01:10:38,981 --> 01:10:42,075
...we went to primary school together.
They won't believe me!

686
01:10:42,552 --> 01:10:46,545
You probably don't remember
that we were classmates.

687
01:10:46,756 --> 01:10:49,224
You probably don't recall
my name--

688
01:10:49,592 --> 01:10:51,059
Lily Shi.

689
01:10:52,695 --> 01:10:54,492
-What?
-It wasn't primary school.

690
01:10:54,697 --> 01:10:57,757
We were in middle school together.
I was in Ms. Chen's class.

691
01:10:57,934 --> 01:10:59,595
You were in Ms. Liu's class.

692
01:10:59,769 --> 01:11:01,737
No kidding?

693
01:11:02,905 --> 01:11:04,566
Here's my card.

694
01:11:04,807 --> 01:11:08,038
-''Zhang Shi-Jie''?
-Call me Jerry.

695
01:11:12,915 --> 01:11:15,475
Let's meet up sometime.

696
01:11:16,118 --> 01:11:18,052
Miss, can I get a pen?

697
01:11:21,824 --> 01:11:23,621
''Zhang Shi-Jie.''

698
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,957
Zhang Shi-Jie.

699
01:11:34,437 --> 01:11:37,600
Hello. All alone?

700
01:11:38,908 --> 01:11:41,968
You don't have a lunch date?

701
01:11:43,746 --> 01:11:45,873
Take your time.

702
01:11:46,048 --> 01:11:48,448
I meant with your girlfriends.

703
01:11:49,819 --> 01:11:53,915
I was just passing by.
I thought I'd see how you were doing.

704
01:11:57,727 --> 01:12:00,025
The flowers are beautiful as usual.

705
01:12:00,196 --> 01:12:02,790
Maybe I'll buy some.

706
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,098
But there's no one
to give them to.

707
01:12:08,504 --> 01:12:11,735
I came to talk to you
about Sandy.

708
01:12:12,842 --> 01:12:14,639
She still won't talk to me.

709
01:12:14,810 --> 01:12:19,713
Can you put in a word for me?
Please?

710
01:12:20,216 --> 01:12:23,743
This is grown-up business.
Why drag her into this?

711
01:12:24,587 --> 01:12:26,817
I've discussed it with Amy--

712
01:12:27,323 --> 01:12:29,018
Hello? Hold on a second.

713
01:12:29,425 --> 01:12:30,824
Listen to me.

714
01:12:30,993 --> 01:12:34,292
Amy wouldn't ask Sandy
to call her ''Mom.''

715
01:12:34,964 --> 01:12:36,727
So it's okay, right?

716
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:39,026
Please talk to her.

717
01:12:40,469 --> 01:12:43,165
Hey! Would you--?

718
01:12:43,973 --> 01:12:46,669
Would you please talk to her
about it?

719
01:12:47,543 --> 01:12:49,408
Let's talk some other time.

720
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:00,211
<i>-Love Home Florist.
-This is Jerry. Is this Lily?</i>

721
01:13:00,323 --> 01:13:04,953
Yes. This is she.
Jerry. Sorry about just now.

722
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:07,823
<i>I'd like to order some flowers.</i>

723
01:13:08,497 --> 01:13:10,556
Were we really in school together?

724
01:13:10,733 --> 01:13:13,531
Why can't I remember?

725
01:13:14,136 --> 01:13:17,333
<i>I was sort of a nerd back then.
Not the kind people remember.</i>

726
01:13:17,506 --> 01:13:20,270
Me too.
Why do you remember me?

727
01:13:23,012 --> 01:13:25,810
You'd like to order flowers?
What kind?

728
01:13:25,982 --> 01:13:27,950
<i>Can you help me decide?</i>

729
01:13:28,351 --> 01:13:30,376
Who are they for?

730
01:13:30,553 --> 01:13:34,387
Is it a special occasion?

731
01:13:34,624 --> 01:13:36,319
<i>They're for a girl.</i>

732
01:13:36,892 --> 01:13:38,860
<i>The message is, ''Dear Emmy.... ''</i>

733
01:13:39,028 --> 01:13:42,896
<i>E-M-M-Y.
''Welcome back. Love, Jerry. ''</i>

734
01:13:47,203 --> 01:13:49,034
How much do you want to spend?

735
01:13:49,872 --> 01:13:53,205
<i>Your call.
They need to be beautiful and big.</i>

736
01:13:53,476 --> 01:13:55,341
<i>I trust your judgment.</i>

737
01:14:00,883 --> 01:14:04,216
Lily, what exactly
should the card say?

738
01:14:04,387 --> 01:14:08,847
It says here ''Dear Emily''
and ''Go to hell.''

739
01:14:10,726 --> 01:14:12,250
This is....

740
01:14:12,461 --> 01:14:18,024
Should it be ''Dear Emily,
welcome back. Love, Jerry''?

741
01:14:18,701 --> 01:14:21,864
-Okay. Yes.
-Is it ''Emily''?

742
01:14:29,745 --> 01:14:32,145
-Flowers to deliver, Xiang!
-Okay.

743
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,297
-Welcome!
-Lily, l....

744
01:14:53,469 --> 01:14:55,061
Wait a moment.

745
01:14:57,073 --> 01:14:59,906
-I'll add some of this.
-Okay.

746
01:15:00,509 --> 01:15:02,977
-How much?
-1 000 NT. Qin, take the money.

747
01:15:03,145 --> 01:15:04,544
Okay!

748
01:15:04,714 --> 01:15:06,614
Thank you.

749
01:15:09,285 --> 01:15:11,344
Please deliver the flowers
on Friday.

750
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,351
-We will.
-Thanks again.

751
01:15:13,522 --> 01:15:15,012
Take care!

752
01:15:16,726 --> 01:15:19,661
Do you want more flowers?
We've got some good ones today.

753
01:15:19,829 --> 01:15:22,491
Did you like the flowers?
I can do a new arrangement.

754
01:15:22,665 --> 01:15:27,159
-You misspelled the name.
-Misspelled? Misspelled what?

755
01:15:27,336 --> 01:15:30,169
''Emmy.'' You wrote ''Emily.''

756
01:15:30,473 --> 01:15:34,068
Oh, no! Qin, you misspelled it.

757
01:15:34,243 --> 01:15:36,939
-Can't be!
-Check it!

758
01:15:37,113 --> 01:15:39,877
-I'm so sorry.
-Jerry, I really am sorry!

759
01:15:40,049 --> 01:15:43,314
My God, how could this happen?
She must have been upset.

760
01:15:43,486 --> 01:15:45,852
Nothing jewelry can't fix.

761
01:15:47,356 --> 01:15:49,153
Wow. That's nice!

762
01:15:49,358 --> 01:15:51,826
-Women are--
-Easy to please!

763
01:15:51,994 --> 01:15:55,191
One little stone and we're all set.
Men are more difficult.

764
01:15:55,364 --> 01:15:57,491
-Correct it.
-All right.

765
01:15:57,666 --> 01:16:00,157
-Change it to Emily. No, I mean--
-Emmy!

766
01:16:00,269 --> 01:16:01,600
-Emmy.
-Emmy.

767
01:16:01,771 --> 01:16:04,934
-E-M-M-Y.
-E-M-M-Y.

768
01:16:05,107 --> 01:16:06,734
Jerry, I'm sorry.

769
01:16:06,909 --> 01:16:09,673
Let me pay you back.
Really, I must.

770
01:16:09,845 --> 01:16:14,111
-Don't worry.
-Please! Are you free now?

771
01:16:14,283 --> 01:16:18,913
It will be really quick.
Let's just have a quick lunch.

772
01:16:19,088 --> 01:16:22,615
Wait for me. Wait.
I won't take no for an answer.

773
01:16:22,825 --> 01:16:25,020
It'll make me feel better.

774
01:16:25,227 --> 01:16:26,819
I'm so embarrassed!

775
01:16:33,702 --> 01:16:36,364
I haven't had a quiet meal for ages.

776
01:16:37,573 --> 01:16:42,408
<i>Jerry Zhang, 47,
divorced for eight years.</i>

777
01:16:42,578 --> 01:16:45,979
<i>Son's in college. Lives alone.</i>

778
01:16:46,148 --> 01:16:49,049
<i>Girlfriend is young,
a flight attendant.</i>

779

<i>He's in the toy business

780
01:16:53,355 --> 01:16:56,813
<i>He might move there,
but she doesn't want to go.</i>

781
01:16:57,026 --> 01:17:00,518
<i>They fight about this a lot.</i>

782
01:17:00,930 --> 01:17:05,026
Jerry, do you play tennis?

783
01:17:06,669 --> 01:17:08,364
Do you like hiking?

784
01:17:10,539 --> 01:17:12,302
I like to stay home.

785
01:17:13,275 --> 01:17:16,005
I like the comfort of home.

786
01:17:21,116 --> 01:17:23,243
-Hello.
-Mrs. Zhao!

787
01:17:23,419 --> 01:17:25,319
It's Miss Shi now.
You forgot again.

788
01:17:25,487 --> 01:17:27,421
-Sorry, Miss Shi.
-Yes.

789
01:17:27,623 --> 01:17:30,683
-Reservation for Friday?
-Friday? Okay.

790
01:17:30,893 --> 01:17:34,124
-7:30.
-7:30. How many of you? Two.

791
01:17:34,296 --> 01:17:36,526
Two. Usual table?

792
01:17:36,699 --> 01:17:39,896
It's not for me.
It's for Mr. Zhang. Jerry Zhang.

793
01:17:40,069 --> 01:17:41,764
Jerry Zhang. Okay. Good.

794
01:17:42,104 --> 01:17:44,095
Should I have a bottle
of wine ready?

795
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,598
Wine?

796
01:17:48,544 --> 01:17:52,241
-Put some champagne on ice.
-Okay.

797
01:18:00,289 --> 01:18:03,690
Welcome!
Do you have a reservation?

798
01:18:03,859 --> 01:18:07,351
-Jerry. Jerry Zhang.
-Yes. This way, please.

799
01:18:14,637 --> 01:18:17,504
Mr. Zhang,
we have champagne for you.

800
01:18:17,873 --> 01:18:19,363
Thanks.

801
01:18:29,985 --> 01:18:32,749
Your guests are here, Miss Shi.

802
01:18:40,095 --> 01:18:44,725
You must be Emmy.
These are for you from Mr. Zhang.

803
01:18:45,534 --> 01:18:47,468
I'm the florist.

804
01:18:47,636 --> 01:18:51,663
I am here to apologize
for misspelling your name.

805
01:18:53,776 --> 01:18:57,542
-No problem. Thank you.
-You two enjoy. Bye!

806
01:19:35,417 --> 01:19:37,408
This way. Into the alley.

807
01:19:42,024 --> 01:19:43,651
Keep going!

808
01:19:50,532 --> 01:19:52,762
Love Home Florist. This is Lily.

809
01:19:52,935 --> 01:19:54,664
<i>Lily.</i>

810
01:19:55,604 --> 01:19:58,505
<i>-Thanks.
-How was the food?</i>

811
01:19:59,408 --> 01:20:00,773
Where do we put the fridge?

812
01:20:00,943 --> 01:20:03,343
-In the kitchen, thanks.
-Okay.

813
01:20:03,712 --> 01:20:05,680
Move up a little. Okay.

814
01:20:05,848 --> 01:20:07,509
This way. This way.

815
01:20:08,417 --> 01:20:10,351
-Miss Ku.
-The washing machine?

816
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:13,887
-Miss Ku?
-Go through the kitchen...

817
01:20:14,056 --> 01:20:15,455
...onto the balcony.

818
01:20:15,657 --> 01:20:19,616
That's not right, mister.
The drawer is on the right side.

819
01:20:19,828 --> 01:20:23,559
Please nail it in. You have
to take the box off first.

820
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,265
-Where should we put this?
-Move back first.

821
01:20:29,271 --> 01:20:32,434
Don't leave yet.
I need help.

822
01:20:33,075 --> 01:20:35,066
Guys, take the case off outside.

823
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:37,803
So how about this?

824
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:41,677
Take the speakers and put it....

825
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:46,014
-Where should I put this?
-Over here, okay? Right here.

826
01:20:46,255 --> 01:20:50,692
-How's that? Yeah.
-The cabinet? Put it here.

827
01:20:50,859 --> 01:20:53,123
-That room?
-Yes, thanks.

828
01:20:55,564 --> 01:20:59,364
-Sir, please take these boxes out.
-The mirror's in the way here.

829
01:20:59,668 --> 01:21:02,466
-Is it okay if I move it?
-Okay. Thanks.

830
01:21:05,874 --> 01:21:09,867
-Please put it in that room.
-Okay.

831
01:21:14,083 --> 01:21:16,711
-Please take that case outside.
-Okay.

832
01:21:17,453 --> 01:21:18,715
Here's another one.

833
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:24,115
Take it down.
Don't leave it by the elevator.

834
01:21:25,794 --> 01:21:28,763
The dryer is done.
Want to test it?

835
01:21:28,964 --> 01:21:30,431
Okay.

836
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:42,474
I heard you used to go to that
restaurant with your husband.

837
01:21:42,911 --> 01:21:44,845
I rarely hear you mention him.

838
01:21:45,013 --> 01:21:47,413
I'm not interested in the past.

839
01:21:50,085 --> 01:21:51,916
Is he a bastard?

840
01:21:52,354 --> 01:21:57,348
It's no one's fault.
We weren't good for each other.

841
01:21:57,559 --> 01:21:59,550
No one's at fault.

842
01:22:01,430 --> 01:22:03,091
Did your girlfriend leave?

843
01:22:03,265 --> 01:22:05,563
She's flying to America this time.

844
01:22:06,969 --> 01:22:08,596
Do you miss her?

845
01:22:10,506 --> 01:22:16,035
I don't know if I miss her
or if I'm just lonely.

846
01:22:17,446 --> 01:22:21,940
People are selfish.
We find a partner to keep us...

847
01:22:22,518 --> 01:22:25,316
...from loneliness in old age.

848
01:22:30,659 --> 01:22:32,786
Where do I put the mirror?

849
01:22:33,061 --> 01:22:35,325
-Here. In the corner.
-There.

850
01:22:37,299 --> 01:22:40,791
Just put it here. Careful.

851
01:22:40,969 --> 01:22:43,494
All right. One, two, three.

852
01:22:45,607 --> 01:22:48,872
That's good. Yeah, over.
There you go.

853
01:22:49,044 --> 01:22:51,274
-Here?
-Okay.

854
01:23:02,224 --> 01:23:04,192
You don't remember me, do you?

855
01:23:15,837 --> 01:23:18,305
My mother gave me this
when I was 8.

856
01:23:19,074 --> 01:23:21,133
I'm a bit reluctant
to give it up.

857
01:23:21,610 --> 01:23:23,373
But keeping it....

858
01:23:26,181 --> 01:23:29,378
You're giving it to your daughter?
And she's also 8?

859
01:23:30,018 --> 01:23:31,747
Why do you want her
to study piano?

860
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,353
Yaqi?

861
01:23:33,755 --> 01:23:36,724
My daughter-- Her mother
passed away two years ago.

862
01:23:37,392 --> 01:23:41,055
I think all little girls like to play piano.

863
01:23:42,731 --> 01:23:48,226
At any rate, I think it's nice
for girls to learn piano.

864
01:23:49,771 --> 01:23:51,500
Have you asked her?

865
01:23:52,941 --> 01:23:54,772
I want to surprise her.

866
01:23:55,277 --> 01:23:58,906
I don't have much money,
and your price fits my budget.

867
01:23:59,314 --> 01:24:00,838
So here I am.

868
01:24:03,318 --> 01:24:07,516
Where's the metronome?

869
01:24:08,857 --> 01:24:10,552
Do you mind its age?

870
01:24:10,759 --> 01:24:12,226
Whose age?

871
01:24:12,427 --> 01:24:16,625
You'll need a new one of these.
I mean the age of the piano.

872
01:24:17,499 --> 01:24:21,094
It's old,
but the sound is excellent.

873
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:24,535
I haven't been taking care of it.

874
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:30,773
It needs tuning,
but it's still a good piano.

875
01:24:33,649 --> 01:24:35,947
Sounds like I'm talking
about myself.

876
01:24:37,552 --> 01:24:40,146
Promise me
you'll take care of it.

877
01:24:40,322 --> 01:24:43,052
I've had it for 20 years.

878
01:24:43,258 --> 01:24:46,284
I'm very attached to it.

879
01:24:49,031 --> 01:24:51,625
-These are great dumplings.
-Really good!

880
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:55,727
Eat one garlic clove
and a dumpling.

881
01:24:55,904 --> 01:24:57,929
One clove for each dumpling!
You sure?

882
01:24:59,007 --> 01:25:01,532
Why not?
I'm sleeping alone tonight.

883
01:25:01,710 --> 01:25:04,838
-What about you?
-Same here.

884
01:25:06,381 --> 01:25:09,350
-Eat up, then.
-Okay.

885
01:25:15,324 --> 01:25:16,814
Good!

886
01:25:21,496 --> 01:25:23,760
Why didn't you order food?

887
01:25:24,599 --> 01:25:26,294
-I've finished.
-Finished?

888
01:25:26,468 --> 01:25:29,869
-Why didn't you wait for us?
-Forget it. I'll order.

889
01:25:30,372 --> 01:25:32,169
You're half an hour late!

890
01:25:32,341 --> 01:25:34,605
I didn't know the movie
was so long.

891
01:25:34,776 --> 01:25:36,767
Jie, 1 0 dumplings for me.

892
01:25:36,945 --> 01:25:41,041
Okay, 1 0 dumplings.
And five more for me.

893
01:25:42,517 --> 01:25:45,213
-Beer.
-She's mad at us.

894
01:25:45,387 --> 01:25:47,446
-Who?
-Her.

895
01:25:47,656 --> 01:25:51,217
Why? Don't be.

896
01:25:51,593 --> 01:25:54,460
Excuse me.
Can I have the chili sauce?

897
01:25:54,629 --> 01:25:56,893
Don't be mad. Here's to you.

898
01:25:57,065 --> 01:25:59,693
-From Jie to Jie.
-Right! You're both Jie.

899
01:25:59,868 --> 01:26:03,497
Yeah. You have a connection
with both of us.

900
01:26:03,672 --> 01:26:05,196
Let's drink.

901
01:26:07,976 --> 01:26:10,536
Just one drink.

902
01:26:10,712 --> 01:26:12,304
I'm leaving.

903
01:26:13,415 --> 01:26:15,246
What happened?

904
01:27:10,305 --> 01:27:13,968
Walking in the Rain

905
01:27:56,384 --> 01:28:00,184
Does the song make you sad?

906
01:28:02,557 --> 01:28:06,857
I don't have time for sadness.
I just try to enjoy it.

907
01:28:58,947 --> 01:29:03,384
<i>Xiang? Where are you?</i>

908
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:07,618
Don't ever call me again!

909
01:29:34,082 --> 01:29:36,243
-Morning.
-Morning.

910
01:29:41,489 --> 01:29:43,423
What are you doing here?

911
01:29:43,925 --> 01:29:46,917
-This is my block too.
-Oh.

912
01:30:11,419 --> 01:30:14,445
Coming! Coming! Hello?

913
01:30:25,634 --> 01:30:28,194
I got it, Qin.

914
01:30:35,543 --> 01:30:38,341
<i>-Hello?
-Bad day, Lily.</i>

915
01:30:39,414 --> 01:30:44,351
<i>One of my shipments was rejected.
I have to go to China to fix it.</i>

916
01:30:44,519 --> 01:30:48,615
<i>Emmy is having a party,
and I can't go. She's very upset.</i>

917
01:30:48,823 --> 01:30:51,758
This time, don't buy more jewelry.

918
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:56,697
If a man calls you
once or twice a day...

919
01:30:57,565 --> 01:30:59,590
...what does it mean?

920
01:31:00,568 --> 01:31:05,767
I'm sure he's not interested in me.

921
01:31:06,307 --> 01:31:09,174
But he even calls me
when he's abroad.

922
01:31:14,716 --> 01:31:17,514
Emmy! Going on vacation?

923
01:31:17,686 --> 01:31:19,313
I'm going to Japan.

924
01:31:20,321 --> 01:31:23,757
-How nice!
-To try to work things out.

925
01:31:25,226 --> 01:31:27,126
Don't be temperamental.

926
01:31:31,266 --> 01:31:35,100
He said he was pretty upset.

927
01:31:35,336 --> 01:31:37,201
I asked if he'd quarreled
with Emmy.

928
01:31:37,372 --> 01:31:40,705
He didn't want to discuss it.

929
01:31:40,875 --> 01:31:44,003
He only says
that he's irritated...

930
01:31:44,179 --> 01:31:47,580
...and must make
an important decision.

931
01:31:50,752 --> 01:31:52,686
What do you think it is?

932
01:31:56,825 --> 01:31:59,350
Wow, gorgeous!

933
01:32:34,062 --> 01:32:36,030
I'm so sorry.

934
01:32:37,899 --> 01:32:40,026
Hang on.

935
01:32:50,378 --> 01:32:52,608
You still have
your wedding ring on.

936
01:32:54,716 --> 01:32:57,184
But I've never seen
your family here.

937
01:32:57,552 --> 01:33:01,784
Hey! You're so cute.
Come here!

938
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:05,391
It's your roommate's birthday today.

939
01:33:05,994 --> 01:33:09,361
Her whole family's here.

940
01:33:10,698 --> 01:33:13,531
I celebrated with my family last year.

941
01:33:16,704 --> 01:33:19,730
But we mustn't be jealous of others.

942
01:33:25,113 --> 01:33:28,014
Hurry, blow out the candles!

943
01:34:11,759 --> 01:34:13,351
What are you doing?

944
01:34:13,561 --> 01:34:15,825
-They want us to pay every week.
-Every week.

945
01:34:15,997 --> 01:34:19,228
-Can I put it on my credit card?
-Yes.

946
01:34:23,972 --> 01:34:26,440
How could my credit card
get denied?

947
01:34:27,876 --> 01:34:30,367
I'll check it out.
Lend me your phone card.

948
01:34:30,812 --> 01:34:32,279
No.

949
01:34:36,718 --> 01:34:40,245
Operator.
I'm calling collect to Hong Kong.

950
01:34:40,488 --> 01:34:42,149
You can keep your card.

951
01:34:42,891 --> 01:34:44,859
I'm broke too.

952
01:34:46,127 --> 01:34:48,857
I'll have my mom
send money here.

953
01:34:50,365 --> 01:34:53,061
What do you mean,
no collect calls?

954
01:34:53,334 --> 01:34:55,461
You call and ask
for Li Mei-ling.

955
01:34:55,637 --> 01:34:57,798
Tell her
that her daughter's calling.

956
01:34:58,339 --> 01:35:00,500
I'm not paying the charges.

957
01:35:00,742 --> 01:35:03,142
Collect call, get it?

958
01:35:04,946 --> 01:35:08,109
You don't know
what a collect call is?

959
01:35:21,095 --> 01:35:23,290
We'd better find Shi Ge.

960
01:35:23,998 --> 01:35:27,399
For what? He lies
and screws people's wives.

961
01:35:27,568 --> 01:35:29,661
That's all he's good for.

962
01:35:30,672 --> 01:35:32,902
Then why did you come here?

963
01:36:22,890 --> 01:36:24,482
Shi Ge.

964
01:36:40,708 --> 01:36:44,906
We have no money
to pay the rent.

965
01:36:54,589 --> 01:36:56,580
You want some?

966
01:37:08,536 --> 01:37:11,096
You really like singing?

967
01:37:14,042 --> 01:37:17,136
I never meant to lie to you.

968
01:37:18,246 --> 01:37:20,544
I wrote a lot of songs.

969
01:37:23,151 --> 01:37:25,711
I worked really hard.

970
01:37:27,321 --> 01:37:31,849
But they don't want them.

971
01:37:33,094 --> 01:37:35,494
They said the songs were crap.

972
01:37:36,030 --> 01:37:41,764
I took them to dinner.
They said the songs were crap.

973
01:37:45,173 --> 01:37:48,609
-This studio's finished.
-Why?

974
01:37:49,544 --> 01:37:52,172
I don't have money for the rent.

975
01:37:52,713 --> 01:37:56,149
We can record a demo.
I can sing--

976
01:37:56,317 --> 01:37:57,682
No way!

977
01:37:57,852 --> 01:38:02,789
Crap! They're all crap!

978
01:38:08,262 --> 01:38:09,820
Sorry.

979
01:38:14,635 --> 01:38:17,627
Take the money and go home.

980
01:38:17,972 --> 01:38:19,906
Good girl.

981
01:38:21,476 --> 01:38:24,809
Just go home.

982
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:27,209
Don't sing.

983
01:38:30,485 --> 01:38:33,682
Don't cry. Don't sing.

984
01:38:33,955 --> 01:38:37,391
I never even got to record anything...

985
01:38:37,725 --> 01:38:39,989
...and you want me to go home.

986
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:47,731
Go in.

987
01:38:48,870 --> 01:38:50,804
Go in and sing.

988
01:38:51,939 --> 01:38:53,634
Good girl.

989
01:38:54,342 --> 01:38:56,071
Go inside and sing.

990
01:38:57,345 --> 01:38:59,279
Go on.

991
01:39:41,289 --> 01:39:44,952
<i>I was thinking
about a blue story.</i>

992
01:39:45,159 --> 01:39:47,252
<i>It gave me a wonderful feeling.</i>

993
01:39:47,461 --> 01:39:52,694
<i>When I tell my friends the story,
they always ask, ''And then what?''</i>

994
01:39:52,867 --> 01:39:57,236
<i>I say, ''There is no 'and then. '
The story is over. ''</i>

995
01:39:58,839 --> 01:40:00,966
<i>I'm really homesick.</i>

996
01:40:14,989 --> 01:40:17,355
<i>I'm finally feeling the pain.</i>

997
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:21,751
<i>Until there's a cure...</i>

998
01:40:22,363 --> 01:40:26,823
<i>...perhaps soap operas
and ice cream...</i>

999
01:40:27,101 --> 01:40:29,001
<i>...will do the trick.</i>

1000
01:40:45,052 --> 01:40:50,388
<i>Mom, I want to settle down,
but how?</i>

1001
01:40:53,461 --> 01:40:56,294
<i>It's easy to find someone
who loves me.</i>

1002
01:40:56,464 --> 01:40:58,955
<i>But where is the right man?</i>

1003
01:41:00,434 --> 01:41:04,131
<i>You always said,
''Men always leave. ''</i>

1004
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:08,871
<i>So whenever I'm in love,
I'm always suspicious of the man.</i>

1005
01:41:09,176 --> 01:41:12,270
<i>Will I ever be lucky enough
to find true love?</i>

1006
01:41:12,780 --> 01:41:15,044
<i>Is love ever that simple?</i>

1007
01:41:15,483 --> 01:41:20,819
<i>When the right man shows up,
how will I know he's the one?</i>

1008
01:41:22,657 --> 01:41:24,215
<i>Mom...</i>

1009
01:41:25,126 --> 01:41:28,755
<i>...can you at least give me a sign?</i>

1010
01:41:30,197 --> 01:41:35,567
<i>Maybe with the sound of a bell...</i>

1011
01:41:36,537 --> 01:41:40,064
<i>...or angels singing...</i>

1012
01:41:41,409 --> 01:41:45,038
<i>...or even a gust of wind.</i>

1013
01:42:13,207 --> 01:42:16,267
Yaqi, see that lady there?

1014
01:42:16,444 --> 01:42:18,912
She's the piano lady
I told you about.

1015
01:42:37,631 --> 01:42:41,499
Mother will be relieved
when I'm home.

1016
01:42:41,669 --> 01:42:43,933
My dad will stop nagging me.

1017
01:42:49,343 --> 01:42:53,746
Maybe I'll go back to Hong Kong
and become a flight attendant.

1018
01:42:54,115 --> 01:42:55,844
I'll fly everywhere...

1019
01:42:56,250 --> 01:42:58,343
...meet different people.

1020
01:42:59,253 --> 01:43:01,016
You can do it too!

1021
01:43:01,822 --> 01:43:04,416
Maybe we could meet
in France one day.

1022
01:43:04,625 --> 01:43:07,287
Does Malaysian Air fly to France?

1023
01:43:09,196 --> 01:43:11,664
I want to go to Greece and Egypt.

1024
01:43:11,866 --> 01:43:14,460
-I want to go to Italy.
-Italian men are gorgeous.

1025
01:43:14,635 --> 01:43:18,401
Yes, they are!
Spanish men are hotter!

1026
01:43:18,572 --> 01:43:22,008
Let's go there too.

1027
01:43:26,647 --> 01:43:28,706
I wonder how Shi Ge is.

1028
01:43:32,186 --> 01:43:34,211
Don't worry about him.

1029
01:43:36,624 --> 01:43:38,353
He'll always find a way.

1030
01:43:40,494 --> 01:43:42,587
Besides, he has love.

1031
01:43:45,933 --> 01:43:47,423
At least...

1032
01:43:49,403 --> 01:43:51,530
...he really loves my mom.

1033
01:44:01,916 --> 01:44:03,645
That's right.

1034
01:44:04,185 --> 01:44:06,210
He's my mother's lover.

1035
01:44:09,156 --> 01:44:12,956
I think my mother loves him
because...

1036
01:44:15,496 --> 01:44:18,090
...he cares about her
more than my father does.

1037
01:44:20,568 --> 01:44:24,800
Does Shi Ge know about you?

1038
01:44:26,273 --> 01:44:27,865
No.

1039
01:44:32,079 --> 01:44:34,445
I came all the way here...

1040
01:44:36,116 --> 01:44:38,209
...just to see if the guy...

1041
01:44:39,620 --> 01:44:41,952
...is a good guy.

1042
01:45:41,549 --> 01:45:44,313
This is the tape
from the earthquake.

1043
01:45:44,852 --> 01:45:46,319
You're on it.

1044
01:45:46,687 --> 01:45:48,314
Am I really?

1045
01:45:48,489 --> 01:45:51,014
Of course! I'm on there too!

1046
01:45:51,225 --> 01:45:53,284
Why else would I give it to you?

1047
01:46:19,186 --> 01:46:20,653
Bye!

1048
01:46:41,175 --> 01:46:42,699
Good.

1049
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:52,412
Again. Go back to ''do.''

1050
01:46:54,922 --> 01:46:56,685
-Did you enjoy that?
-Very much.

1051
01:46:56,890 --> 01:47:00,189
-Why do you want to learn piano?
-I like it.

1052
01:47:00,894 --> 01:47:03,124
Yes. Liking it is important.

1053
01:47:03,297 --> 01:47:06,664
When you grow up, you can
play it for your loved ones.

1054
01:47:06,834 --> 01:47:09,029
Dad, I'll play for you.

1055
01:48:12,599 --> 01:48:14,863
I am an abandoned woman.

1056
01:48:18,072 --> 01:48:20,506
I am an abandoned woman.

1057
01:48:25,446 --> 01:48:27,914
I am an abandoned woman.

1058
01:48:30,117 --> 01:48:32,312
I am an abandoned woman!

1059
01:48:33,020 --> 01:48:35,352
I am an abandoned woman!

1060
01:48:37,324 --> 01:48:39,383
I am an abandoned woman.

1061
01:48:39,593 --> 01:48:41,561
I am an abandoned woman.

1062
01:48:42,563 --> 01:48:44,724
I am an abandoned woman.

1063
01:48:45,599 --> 01:48:47,863
I am an abandoned woman!

1064
01:49:03,650 --> 01:49:05,811
So I am an abandoned woman.

1065
01:49:08,622 --> 01:49:11,090
Yeah. I am an abandoned woman.

1066
01:49:47,394 --> 01:49:48,986
Happy birthday.

1067
01:50:02,109 --> 01:50:03,770
-Morning!
-Morning!

1068
01:50:09,183 --> 01:50:10,650
Morning!

1069
01:50:32,439 --> 01:50:35,306
Good morning!
Have a nice day!
