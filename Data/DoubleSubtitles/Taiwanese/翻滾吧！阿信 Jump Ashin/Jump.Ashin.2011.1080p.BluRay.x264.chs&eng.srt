183
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,350
还要去给医生看

184
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,110
要花多少钱你知道吗
The doctor visits are expensive.

185
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,230
我以后赚钱还你嘛

还想要赚钱还我

190

搞不好我要养你一辈子

你真的不要再考虑一下

不要再让他继续练了好不好

他很不容易
It took him a lot

199
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,790
才能成为一位体操选手
to be a gymnast.

200
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,710
难道你要他就这样放弃
You really want him to stop?

201
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,550
体操我是不懂啦
I don't know about gymnastics.

202

207
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,870
阿信

先把东西收一收
Pack your things,

215
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,550
跟你妈回去
and go home with your mom.

216
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,700
啊

217
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,870

Go pack your stuff, didn't you hear that?

219
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,590
每天就只想到练体操练体操
You care only gymnastics.

220

从现在开始

00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,390
不准你再练体操

00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,750
跟我回家学做生意卖水果
Stay home and learn the fruit business.

226
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,470
搞不好比练体操还有出息
It's a better prospect than gymnastics.

227
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,590
妈   拜托

老板啊
Hey man,

459
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,870
哪有人这样做生意的
this is not how you do business.

460
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,910
位置这么少，客人要坐哪里
With so few seats, where shall we be seated?

461
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,870
面摊可以关一关了啦
Maybe you should shut the stall down.

462
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,780
赶快吃啦

喔！抱歉啦
Oh, sorry!

466
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,430
不小心的啦
I didn't mean la.

467
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,830
找死喔
Are you looking for trouble?

468
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,350
你们如果那么饿
If you are that hungry

469
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,470
不然我“下面”给你们吃啦
how about I let you swallow my dick?

470
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,070
你皮在痒了
You asked for this.

471
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,520
也许这次就不是不小心的啰

你们两个胆识不错
You two really have balls.

476
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,620
以后就跟我
Come join my gang.

477
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,550
啥小
What the Fuck.

478
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,430
你爸我叫木瓜啦
I am Papaya.

479
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,830
我爸是黑松

480
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,550

485
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,710
有没有要买
Do you want to buy any fruit?

486
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,060
不然我要收摊了
We're closing.

487
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,390
好啊
Fine,

488
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,860

跟你一样
And, be like you,

504
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,070
每天躲在体操馆
staying in the gym everyday,

505
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,790
过年只休两天
With only two days oh' during the Chinese New Year?

506

算了吧

我现在才知道外面有多好玩
Now I know there is so much fun out here.

509

我以前怎么那么乖啊

被体操绑得死死的

体操选手一辈子只有一次巅峰期
A gymnast has only one peak period in his life,

516
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,670
你再不回来，就来不及了

517
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,910

如果我是练体操的料

523
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,190
一年前教练就会把我留下来了
the coach wouldn't let me go a year ago.

524
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,550
不要怪别人
Stop blaming others.

525
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,100
你自己选的
This is your choice.

Pickle.

914
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:23,910
跟我回宜兰
Let's go back to Yilan.

915
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:28,220
怎么回去
How?

916
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,190
你以为我没有想过喔
You think I never thought about it?

917
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,710
我们现在回去
If we go back now,

918
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:41,070
不是被抓去关
we'll either end up in prison

919
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:43,030
就是被人打死在路边
or be beaten to death.

920
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:44,980
那又怎样
So?

921
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,110
有问题我们可以一起解决啊
We can solve problems together.

922
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:49,070
就像以前一样
Just as the old days.

923
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,230
但人是我杀的
It 's me who killed him.

924
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,990
以前是我不够强
I was not strong enough

925
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,830
所以才会变成这样
so we end up like this.

926
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:16,070
我要留在台北
I'm staying in Taipei.

927
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:22,020
你看
You'll see,

928
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:25,830
我告诉你
I'm telling you

929
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,030
我马上就会做老大了
I'll become a gangster head soon.

930
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,340
以后发生什么事情
If anything happens in the future,

931
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,020
换我罩你
it'll be my turn to cover you.

932
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,100
你罩我
You cover me?

933
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:40,750
你怎么罩我
How can you cover me?

934
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,790
你干嘛这样看我啦
Why are you looking at me like this?

935
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,150
你想要啦我喔
Do you want to kiss me?

936
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:02,190
喝啦
Just drink some more.

937
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:59,190
菜脯？菜脯？
Pickle? Pickle?

938
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,030
阿信诶

01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,020
我跟你说
you see, that night

940
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,470
那天晚上为了安非他命
I wanted the amphetamine so much,

941
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,390
骗你出来吃面
that I lied to get you out

942
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,470
害到你被人家打
and you were beaten so badly.

943
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,300
我真的很没用
I'm such a loser.

944
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:43,470
对不起
I am sorry.

945
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:47,550
我不配当你的兄弟
I don't deserve to be your buddy.

946
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:54,230
你就回去宜兰好好练体操啦
You shall go back to Yilan and do your gymnastics.

947
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:58,550

948
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:00,870
拿给我爸爸

949
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:05,110
说以后他再也打不到我了
Tell him he can't beat me anymore.

950
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,270
要好好照顾自己
Ask him to take care of himself.

951
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:09,580
要他记得
Tell him to remember that

952
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:14,030

面筋如果问起我
If Cheese asked about me,

955
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,870
你就跟她说
tell her, just as the song says:

956
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,910
“忘了你，忘了我”
鈥淔orget you, forget me."

957
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:31,060

走
Let's go.

962
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:30,790
这样我就可以回宜兰了
Now, I can go back to Yilan.

963
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,190

你为什么就是不听我的
Why didn't you listen to me?

967
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:49,710
你不是说你要当老大吗
You said you'll become the head.

968
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,870
你要罩我的吗

我应该回去吗
I should go back?

977

你怎么那么喜欢待在这里啊
Why do you like it here so much?

978

老大
Boss,

01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:46,830
这小子如果这么有种

干脆就完成他的愿望啦

剁脚剁手
Cut off his legs, hands

1001
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:55,830
连他那个也剁掉拿去喂鳄鱼啦

1002
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,710

好了啦
Shut up.

1008

我知道这个死孩子
I know this asshole dealt drugs

1009
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:27,590
偷偷在我背后卖安非他命

我也知道
I also know that

1011
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:34,990
我也知道是他先带人打你
the whole mess was

1012
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:38,150
才会发生这一堆有的没的事
because he beat you in first place.

1013
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,510
但是不管怎么说
Even so, it's the son of mine

1014
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:51,510
今天是我黑松的儿子被打

我问你
Let me ask you,

1017
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:07,550
你明知道我不会放过你
why did you come back

1018
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,710
你怎么还敢回来啊
when you knew I won't be easy on you?

1019
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:15,070
因为我要翻身
'Cause I want a new start.

1020

我要重新练体操
I want to go back to gymnastics.

你是说那种翻来翻去的体操吗
That jumping and rolling thing?

1023
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,230
等一下就没手没脚了
You'll lose your hands and legs soon,

1024
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:29,670
我看你要怎么翻
I would love to see you roll

1025
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:30,950
闭嘴啦

阿信
Ashin,

1063
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:41,910
你爸我这次一定要给你死啊
I'll kill you this time.

1064
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:48,070
有胆别跑啊
Don't go! Go to hell!

1065
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:50,950
你不是很带种
Where did you put your balls?

1066
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:55,180
有胆别跑啊
Why don't you stop and fight?

1067
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:59,150
谢谢你愿意原谅阿信
Thank you for giving Ashin a chance.

1068
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:00,750
你不要跑那么快啦
Don't run so fast.

1069
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:04,430
有一半理由是因为你
Half the reason is of you,

1070
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:08,830
另一半是因为他自己
the other half is of he himself.

1071
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,270
这小子个性有够强
He is a really stubborn young man.

1072
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,910
他的个性跟你年轻的时候很像勒
He's quite like the younger you.

1073
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:21,990
像我
Me?

1074
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:24,350
你也看一下
Come on.

1075
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:27,110
我的体能比他好太多了吧
I'm much stronger than he is.

1076
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,430
对啦
Yeah.

1077
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:38,700
那个时候你是队上最强的
You were the best among the team.

1078
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:41,470
唉～
Alas.

1079
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:43,230
强有什么用
Strong? So what?

1080
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:46,150
还不是要吃饭拉屎
You still need to eat and shit.

1081
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:55,390
这小子有心想要练
He does want to do gymnastics.

1082
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,510
你觉得他有希望吗
Do you think he has prospects?

1083
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:05,310
年底有个国际体操邀请赛
There is an international game at the end of the year.

1084
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:09,190
我也没把握他能不能上场比赛
I am not sure if he can make it.

1085
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:11,500
你是教练勒
You're the coach!

1086
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:13,430
这种话你也说的出来
You shouldn't say this.

1087
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,350
好好给我操一下
Train him seriously.

1088
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,510
不要给我漏气喔
Don't you lose my face.

1089
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:21,350
你是流氓勒
Come on, you're a gang master.

1090
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:23,030
我哪敢给你漏气喔
How would I dare to lose your face?

1091
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:24,950
好啦好啦
Fine.

1092
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:25,830
不要说这个啦
Quit it.

1093
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:27,230
诶你看
Look

1094
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:45,950
从现在我不会再逃避
I will not run away anymore

1095
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:50,030
重新的唤起
Face the calling

1096
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:56,430
埋藏在我心底的血液
the blood running deep within my heart.

1097
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:58,870
沉住气
Stay focused.

1098
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:02,150
我的，心不再移
I will not be astray again.

1099
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:06,190
屏息不放弃
Hold my breath, never give up.

1100
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:07,950
慢慢的
Slowly,

1101
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:12,990
朝着我的梦前进
I walk toward my dream.

1102
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:16,190
忘了吧
Forget it.

1103
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:21,990
混乱的事不再提
Don't mention the mess.

1104
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:24,110
放了吧
Let it go.

1105
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:33,350
把心思变唯一
Focus on one thing only.

1106
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:40,320
我会用尽所有力
I'll do my best.

1107
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:46,390
奋力的跃起在天际
Leap as high as the sky.

1108
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:51,030
迎着光明
Toward the brightest.

1109
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:56,310
我会更用力呼吸
I'll breath harder.

1110
01:37:56,440 --> 01:38:02,390
飞到另一个灿烂天空
Fly into another brilliant sky.

1111
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:06,300
完美
Perfect.

1112
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:12,030
落地
Landing.

1113
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:20,860
阿信
Ashin

1114
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:24,220
阿信
Ashin.

1115
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:27,180
你过来一下
Come here.

1116
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:36,140
教练
Coach.

1117
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:39,060
把手放上来
Put your hand here.

1118
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:46,980
抚摸它
Touch it.

1119
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:51,390
把它想像成是一匹真的马
Think of it as a real horse.

1120
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:54,670
抚摸它的毛
Stroke its hair.

1121
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:58,190
跟它说话
Talk to it:

1122
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:00,590
感谢你
Thank you.

1123
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:02,420
因为有你
We can do this sport

1124
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:05,270
我们才能从事这项运动
only because of you.

1125
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:06,340
教练
Coach,

1126
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:09,150
你在干嘛
what are you doing?

1127
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:12,030
跟它说话啊
Talking to it.

1128
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:23,950
男子体操啊
Man gymnastics events are:

1129
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:25,670
地板、鞍马、吊环
Floor Exercise, Pommel Horse, Still Rings

1130
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:27,550
跳马、双杠、单杠
Vault, Parallel Bars, Horizontal bar

1131
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:28,950
这六个项目
Six in total.

1132
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:30,710
全都是冰冷的器材
They are all performed on cold facilities.

1133
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:33,990
如果你没有热情
If you don't learn to feel them,

1134
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:37,670
如果你不跟它建立关系
don't build relationships with them,

1135
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:40,590
你就永远无法控制你的恐惧
you can never overcome your fears to them.

1136
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:49,230
运用你的想像力
So, use your imagination.

1137
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:51,230
跟它说话
Talk to it.

1138
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:53,430
懂了吗
Get it?

1139
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:02,680
所以你跟教练两个人
So you and the coach have stroked

1140
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:05,590
就站在那里摸跳马摸十分钟喔
the vault for an entire 10 minutes?

1141
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:08,390
对啊
Yeah.

1142
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:09,580
很好笑喔
It is funny, isn't it?

1143
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:11,060
不会呀
No.

1144
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,230
把跳马当成活的
Does it make you feel better

1145
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:15,230
有让你感觉比较好吗
when thinking it as something alive?

1146
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:18,590
好像是有点用啦
Kind of.

1147
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:22,710
但我觉得最大的问题
But my biggest problem

1148
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,430
还是在我自己身上
comes from myself.

1149
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:29,110
如果没办法克服我的左腿
If I don't overcome my left leg,

1150
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:32,590
很难会有好成绩
I can never get a good result.

1151
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:36,340
阿信
Ashin.

1152
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:38,150
嗯
What?

1153
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:43,630
其实我很羡慕你是个体操选手
Actually, I envy you because you're a gymnast.

1154
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:48,750
是喔
Oh yeah?

1155
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:50,390
嗯
Yes.

1156
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:55,350
我曾经是个游泳选手
I was a swimmer.

1157
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:57,460
妈勒
Holy crap!

1158
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:59,030
真的假的
Really?

1159
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:02,380
那你穿泳衣一定很好看哦
You must look great in swimming suit.

1160
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:05,350
喂
Hey,

1161
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:07,310
人家很认真耶
I'm serious.

1162
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:09,510
好啦好啦
Fine.

1163
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:11,300
那你还有在游吗
Do you still swim?

1164
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:24,630
不游了
Not anymore.

1165
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:27,660
为什么
Why?

1166
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:43,230
阿信
Ashin.

1167
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:46,510
你要坚持下去
You must hang on.

1168
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:50,190
你不光是为了自己奋斗
You fight not only for yourself

1169
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:52,790
也是替那些曾经有梦想的人奋斗
but for those who had dreams.

1170
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:58,270
喔～对了
One more thing.

1171
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:00,830
有一通599的留言
You have a message from 599.

1172
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:02,310
她说
She said:

1173
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:04,590
加油
Go for it!

1174
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:11,270
我知道了
I got it.

1175
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:23,620
哥
Brother,

1176
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:27,190
爸快要死了
dad is dying.

1177
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:31,230
妈叫我们回去帮他换衣服
Mom wants us to go home and change dad's clothes.

1178
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:13,590
爸
Dad?

1179
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:45,990
哥，你在干嘛
Brother, what are you doing?

1180
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:50,790
阿爸有说过
Dad said, if you feel like crying

1181
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:53,750
想哭的时候就倒立
you can do handstand.

1182
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:57,040
这样眼泪就不会流下来了
So the tears won't fall down.

1183
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:51,790
对啊
This is it!

1184
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,470
把不够的补满
Add to what is needed.

1185
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,910
把不足的长度补齐
Fill the short one to the right length.

1186
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:09,150
很感谢你
Thank you for taking care of Ashin

1187
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:11,750
阿信住这边都托你照顾
while he's staying here.

1188
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:13,670
不要这样说
Never mind.

1189
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:16,150
事情有解决就好
As long as the problems are solved.

1190
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,870
阿信喔
Ashin

1191
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:25,860
你来干嘛
What are you doing here?

1192
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,030
为什么你就是不让我练体操啊
Why cant you just let me do gymnastics?

1193
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:35,870
你把我害的还不够惨吗
You want to see me live in hell again?

1194
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:36,910
阿信
Ashin

1195
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:38,710
为什么你连让我重新作人的机会
Why do you want to deprive me

1196
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:40,030
都不给我
of the chance to have a new life?

1197
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:42,630
我就一定得回去卖水果
You want me to sell fruit again?

1198
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:44,870
我的人生是我在过的
This is my life,

1199
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:46,020
不是你
not yours.

1200
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:49,990
林太太
Mrs. Lin Mrs. Lin

1201
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:53,540
教练
Coach,

1202
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:55,180
不管我妈怎么说
no matter what my mom said,

1203
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:57,550
我这次绝对不会退出体操队
I will not leave the team this time.

1204
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:04,150
这双鞋你先拿着
Hold the shoes first.

1205
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:10,220
这双鞋的左脚
The left one has special pad and sole

1206
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:13,910
有特制加厚的鞋垫与鞋底
with just the right thickness.

1207
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:16,590
长度刚好可以让你的两条腿
So the lengths of your legs

1208
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:17,980
变得一样长
can become even.

1209
