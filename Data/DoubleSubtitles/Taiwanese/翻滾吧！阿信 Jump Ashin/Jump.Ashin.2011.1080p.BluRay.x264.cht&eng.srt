一天到晚就只會練體操練體操 All you know is gymnastics.

182
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,430
有本事你就不要受傷 If you're really good,

183
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,350
還要去給醫生看 you'd better never get hurt.

184
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,110
要花多少錢你知道嗎 The doctor visits are expensive.

185
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,230
我以後賺錢還你嘛 I'll earn money to pay you back later.

186
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,070
我就只想練體操啊 I just want to do gymnastics.

187
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,260
賺錢還我 Pay me back?

188
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,510
以後都不知道可不可以養活自己 I wonder if you can even feed yourself.

189
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,230
還想要賺錢還我 Let alone to repay me.

190
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,430
你如果繼續練體操 If you keep doing gymnastics,

191
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,270
搞不好我要養你一輩子 I may need to support you forever.

192
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,390
長大了啊 A grown-up now.

194
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,190
是否有那個能力 are capable or not?

195
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,510
你真的不要再考慮一下 Are you really sure about this?

196
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,150
不要再讓他繼續練了好不好 Don't let him do this anymore.

197
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,300
黃教練 Please, Coach Huang.

198
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,670
他很不容易 It took him a lot

199
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,790
才能成爲一位體操選手 to be a gymnast.

200
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,710
難道你要他就這樣放棄 You really want him to stop?

201
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,550
體操我是不懂啦 I don't know about gymnastics.

叫你東西收一收你是沒有聽到是嗎 Go pack your stuff, didn't you hear that?

219
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,590
每天就只想到練體操練體操 You care only gymnastics.

220

不准你再練體操 no more gymnastics.

225

跟我回家學做生意賣水果 Stay home and learn the fruit business.

226
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,470
搞不好比練體操還有出息 It's a better prospect than gymnastics.

227
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,590
媽    拜託 Mom, please

01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:46,830
這小子如果這麼有種 if he is really not afraid of death,

997
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,870
乾脆就完成他的願望啦 we can make his dream come true.

01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:55,830
連他那個也剁掉拿去喂鱷魚啦 and his dick to feed the crocodile.

1002
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,710
你們兩個是那邊爽什麼 You guys are really enjoying this, huh?

1003
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:03,980
阿信 Ashin!

1006
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:11,510
少爺 Master.

01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:12,830
好了啦 Shut up.

1008
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:24,790
我知道這個死孩子 I know this asshole dealt drugs

1009
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:27,590
偷偷在我背後賣安非他命 behind my back.

1010
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,150
我也知道 I also know that

1011
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:34,990
我也知道是他先帶人打你 the whole mess was

1012
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:38,150
纔會發生這一堆有的沒的事 because he beat you in first place.

1013
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,510
但是不管怎麼說 Even so, it's the son of mine

1014
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:51,510
今天是我黑松的兒子被打 that was beaten.

1015
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:55,070
這要是傳出去能聽嗎 I can not bear to lose the face.

1016
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:02,940
我問你 Let me ask you,

1017
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:07,550
你明知道我不會放過你 why did you come back

1018
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,710
你怎麼還敢回來啊 when you knew I won't be easy on you?

1019
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:15,070
因爲我要翻身 'Cause I want a new start.

1020
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,150
我要重新練體操 I want to go back to gymnastics.

1021
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:22,980
體操 Gymnastics?

1022
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:25,670
你是說那種翻來翻去的體操嗎 That jumping and rolling thing?

1023
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,230
等一下就沒手沒腳了 You'll lose your hands and legs soon,

1024
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:29,670
我看你要怎麼翻 I would love to see you roll

1025
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:30,950
閉嘴啦 Shut up.

1026
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:42,150

你一定要給我拿到金牌 within one year.

1031
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:59,750
要不然就不是在這池 If not, you won't be bathing in this one

1032
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:02,550
而是在隔壁那池 but that one.

我看你這個體能啊 You're not capable of

1056
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:01,790
你還不能練單項 practicing individual event yet.

來來來，起來起來起來 Get up from there.

謝謝你願意原諒阿信 Thank you for giving Ashin a chance.

1068
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:00,750
你不要跑那麼快啦 Don't run so fast.

1069
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:04,430
有一半理由是因爲你 Half the reason is of you,

1070
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:08,830
另一半是因爲他自己 the other half is of he himself.

1071
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,270
這小子個性有夠強 He is a really stubborn young man.

1072
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,910
他的個性跟你年輕的時候很像勒 He's quite like the younger you.

你覺得他有希望嗎 Do you think he has prospects?

1083
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:05,310
年底有個國際體操邀請賽 There is an international game at the end of the year.

1084
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:09,190
我也沒把握他能不能上場比賽 I am not sure if he can make it.

1085
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:11,500
你是教練勒 You're the coach!

1086
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:13,430
這種話你也說的出來 You shouldn't say this.

埋藏在我心底的血液 the blood running deep within my heart.

1097
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:58,870
沉住氣 Stay focused.

1098
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:02,150
我的，心不再移 I will not be astray again.

01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:06,190
屏息不放棄 Hold my breath, never give up.

1100
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:07,950
慢慢的 Slowly,

1101
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:12,990
朝着我的夢前進 I walk toward my dream.

1102
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:16,190
忘了吧 Forget it.

1103
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:21,990
混亂的事不再提 Don't mention the mess.

01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:24,110
放了吧 Let it go.

1105

把心思變唯一 Focus on one thing only.

1106
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:40,320
我會用盡所有力 I'll do my best.

奮力的躍起在天際 Leap as high as the sky.

我會更用力呼吸 I'll breath harder.

01:37:56,440 --> 01:38:02,390
飛到另一個燦爛天空 Fly into another brilliant sky.

01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:39,060
把手放上來 Put your hand here.

1118
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:46,980
撫摸它 Touch it.

1119
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:51,390
把它想像成是一匹真的馬 Think of it as a real horse.

1120
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:54,670
撫摸它的毛 Stroke its hair.

1121
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:58,190
跟它說話 Talk to it:

1122
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:00,590
感謝你 Thank you.

1123
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:02,420
因爲有你 We can do this sport

1124
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:05,270
我們才能從事這項運動 only because of you.

1125
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:06,340
教練 Coach,

1126
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:09,150
你在幹嘛 what are you doing?

1127
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:12,030
跟它說話啊 Talking to it.

1128
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:23,950
男子體操啊 Man gymnastics events are:

1129
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:25,670
地板、鞍馬、 吊環 Floor Exercise, Pommel Horse, Still Rings

1130
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:27,550
跳馬、 雙槓、 單槓 Vault, Parallel Bars, Horizontal bar

1131
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:28,950
這六個項目 Six in total.

1132
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:30,710
全都是冰冷的器材 They are all performed on cold facilities.

1133
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:33,990
如果你沒有熱情 If you don't learn to feel them,

1134
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:37,670
如果你不跟它建立關係 don't build relationships with them,

1135
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:40,590
你就永遠無法控制你的恐懼 you can never overcome your fears to them.

1136
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:49,230
運用你的想像力 So, use your imagination.

1137
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:51,230
跟它說話 Talk to it.

1138
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:53,430
懂了嗎 Get it?

1139
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:02,680
所以你跟教練兩個人 So you and the coach have stroked

1140
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:05,590
就站在那裏摸跳馬摸十分鐘喔 the vault for an entire 10 minutes?

1141
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:08,390
對啊 Yeah.

1142
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:09,580
很好笑喔 It is funny, isn't it?

1143
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:11,060
不會呀 No.

1144
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,230
把跳馬當成活的 Does it make you feel better

1145
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:15,230
有讓你感覺比較好嗎 when thinking it as something alive?

1146
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:18,590
好像是有點用啦 Kind of.

1147
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:22,710
但我覺得最大的問題 But my biggest problem

1148
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,430
還是在我自己身上 comes from myself.

1149
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:29,110
如果沒辦法克服我的左腿 If I don't overcome my left leg,

1150
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:32,590
很難會有好成績 I can never get a good result.

1151
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:36,340
阿信 Ashin.

1152
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:38,150
嗯 What?

1153
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:43,630
其實我很羨慕你是個體操選手 Actually, I envy you because you're a gymnast.

1154
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:48,750

01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:50,390
嗯 Yes.

1156
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:55,350
我曾經是個游泳選手 I was a swimmer.

1157
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:57,460
媽勒 Holy crap!

1158
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:59,030
真的假的 Really?

1159
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:02,380
那你穿泳衣一定很好看哦 You must look great in swimming suit.

1160
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:05,350
喂 Hey,

1161
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:07,310
人家很認真耶 I'm serious.

1162
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:09,510
好啦好啦 Fine.

1163
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:11,300
那你還有在遊嗎 Do you still swim?

1164
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:24,630
不遊了 Not anymore.

1165
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:27,660
爲什麼 Why?

1166
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:43,230
阿信 Ashin.

1167
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:46,510
你要堅持下去 You must hang on.

1168
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:50,190
你不光是爲了自己奮鬥 You fight not only for yourself

1169
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:52,790
也是替那些曾經有夢想的人奮鬥 but for those who had dreams.

1170
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:58,270
喔～ 對了 One more thing.

1171
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:00,830
有一通599的留言 You have a message from 599.

1172
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:02,310
她說 She said:

1173
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:04,590

1174
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:11,270

1175
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:23,620
哥 Brother,

1176
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:27,190
爸快要死了 dad is dying.

1177
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:31,230
媽叫我們回去幫他換衣服 Mom wants us to go home and change dad's clothes.

1178
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:13,590
爸 Dad?

1179
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:45,990
哥，你在幹嘛 Brother, what are you doing?

1180
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:50,790
阿爸有說過 Dad said, if you feel like crying

1181
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:53,750
想哭的時候就倒立 you can do handstand.

1182
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:57,040
這樣眼淚就不會流下來了 So the tears won't fall down.

1183
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:51,790
對啊 This is it!

1184
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,470
把不夠的補滿 Add to what is needed.

1185
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,910
把不足的長度補齊 Fill the short one to the right length.

1186
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:09,150
很感謝你 Thank you for taking care of Ashin

1187
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:11,750
阿信住這邊都託你照顧 while he's staying here.

1188
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:13,670
不要這樣說 Never mind.

1189
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:16,150
事情有解決就好 As long as the problems are solved.

01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,870
阿信喔 Ashin

01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:25,860
你來幹嘛 What are you doing here?

1192
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,030
爲什麼你就是不讓我練體操啊 Why cant you just let me do gymnastics?

1193
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:35,870
你把我害的還不夠慘嗎 You want to see me live in hell again?

1194
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:36,910
阿信 Ashin

1195
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:38,710
爲什麼你連讓我重新作人的機會 Why do you want to deprive me

1196
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:40,030
都不給我 of the chance to have a new life?

1197
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:42,630
我就一定得回去賣水果 You want me to sell fruit again?

1198
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:44,870
我的人生是我在過的 This is my life,

1199
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:46,020
不是你 not yours.

1200
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:49,990
林太太 Mrs. Lin Mrs. Lin

1201
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:53,540
教練 Coach,

1202
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:55,180
不管我媽怎麼說 no matter what my mom said,

1203
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:57,550
我這次絕對不會退出體操隊 I will not leave the team this time.

1204
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:04,150
這雙鞋你先拿着 Hold the shoes first.

1205
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:10,220
這雙鞋的左腳 The left one has special pad and sole

1206
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:13,910
有特製加厚的鞋墊與鞋底 with just the right thickness.

1207
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:16,590
長度剛好可以讓你的兩條腿 So the lengths of your legs

1208
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:17,980
變得一樣長 can become even.

1209
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:20,180
我想了很久了 I thought about this for a long time.

1210
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:23,750
這是唯一可以解決你長短腿的辦法 It's the only solution to your legs.

1211
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:26,990
謝謝教練 Thank you, coach.

謝你媽 it's your mom.

1215
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,190
你知道你小時候得過小兒麻痹嗎 Do you know you had Polio?

1216
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:41,630
你媽一直爲這件事情很自責 She has been blaming herself for it.

1217
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,870
她說是她沒有把你照顧好 She said it's her fault that

1218
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:45,590
所以才讓你生病 led to your illness.

1219
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:48,060
還好她從小 Thanks to her massaging your leg everyday

1220
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:50,030
就每天幫你按摩你的腳 since you were a kid,

1221
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:51,950
要不然你的左腳 or your left leg would wither

1222
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:53,750
會萎縮的比現在更嚴重 even more seriously than it is now.

1223
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:54,950
你懂了嗎 Do you get it?

1224
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:56,590
不要動啦 Don't move.

1225
01:48:57,560 --> 01:49:00,230
媽，爲什麼你要按哥哥的腳啊 Mom, why are you massaging Brother's leg?

你小時候不是最會吵 You used to say that

1238
01:49:57,680 --> 01:49:58,950
吵着要長大 you want to be a grown-up.

1239
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:00,870
就要吃這個纔會長大 Eat this so you can be a grown-up.
