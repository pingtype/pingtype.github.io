1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,519
Tropical Fish

2
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,313
Nature works in mysterious ways.

3
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,436
A young man named Liu

4
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,317
wrote to us from Taipei.

5
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,276
He said he found a hearing aid

6
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,554
when he was little.

7
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,391
He tried it on

8
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,837
and heard a mysterious voice.

9
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,036
Since then,

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,589
he hears less of everyday sounds.

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,397
But the mysterious voice

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,753
keeps telling him

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,833
he is gaining a super power

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,230
with which he will save the world.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,797
Very interesting!

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,678
Do go on sending us your letters.

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,672
Tell us your exotic experiences.

18
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,956
Share your sensations with us.

19
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,076
OK, before we hear more of

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,389
the legend of King Saloman,

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,799
the Super Fish-Man,

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,268
Iet's listen to a song first...

23
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,512
Liu Chih-chiang!

24
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,437
Just 31 days to the Joint Entrance Exam!

25
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,750
I can't go on punishing you.

26
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,949
But if you fail the Exam,

27
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,871
you'll suffer all your life.

28
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,552
Those who lack confidence...

29
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,834
Raise your hands!

30
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,153
Okay, hands down.

31
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,671
You've given up?

32
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,673
Throwing in the towel?

33
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,069
Cowards!

34
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,871
I had one student who never scored...

35
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,077
... higher than 400 in any test.

36
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,517
But he passed the Exam! You know why?

37
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,310
Because he never gave up.

38
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,113
He slept just 4 hours a day

39
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,350
in the final month.

40
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,394
He never let up.

41
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,670
And he made it!

42
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,830
You could do the same.

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,991
31 days is plenty.

44
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,670
Work hard and don't lose heart.

45
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,637
Who dares say you won't succeed?

46
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,031
Now I'll ask you again...

47
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,836
Those who lack confidence...

48
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,068
Raise your hands!

49
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,078
Are you giving up?

50
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,269
No!

51
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,239
Are you confident?

52
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,514
Yes!

53
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,669
Louder!

54
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,715
Yes!

55
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,793
Did I ask you to play with me?

56
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,438
Are you any good?

57
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,673
Idiot!

58
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,837
Idiot! Let's go.

59
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,150
I'm ashamed to have a friend like you.

60
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,634
Have a cigarette.

61
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,518
Juvenile Division?

62
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,994
Where is the boy?

63
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,670
Did you see that thing in the paper?

64
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,796
About girls being slashed in the backside

65
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,389
when they're out walking at night?

66
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,553
Well, meet the wolf himself!

67
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,358
Bullshit!

68
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,710
You don't believe me?

69
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,757
I'll show you next time.

70
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,079
OK!

71
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,149
What do you want most after the Exam?

72
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,551
A tank of tropical fish.

73
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,510
Don't you have a small one already?

74
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,509
No fish yet?

75
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,839
My dad won't let me.

76
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,273
I put the tank away.

77
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,589
He never stops bugging you, huh?

78
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,070
You know what I want most?

79
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,308
What?

80
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,636
Get laid.

81
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,870
Hello, how are you?

82
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,756
You don't know me yet,

83
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,432
but I believe in fate.

84
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,840
Amid the sea of people,

85
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,308
we ride the same bus.

86
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,952
That's fate. It means

87
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,556
we could do other things together.

88
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,037
Let's go further

89
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,429
than the bus can take us.

90
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,030
I invite you on a submarine trip.

91
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,509
We'll soon bid farewell to Junior High.

92
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,956
At that historic moment, I'll show you

93
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,158
tropical fish on Green lsland.

94
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,038
Tsai Chia-chi, 8 out of 1 00!

95
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,392
Hsu Wei-li, 23!

96
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,592
Liu Chih-chiang, 41!

97
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,911
Hands out!

98
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,150
Have a puff.

99
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,910
Wasn't that a shitty subject

100
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,194
for an essay?

101
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,996
"My dream"? What the hell...

102
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,998
You know what I was gonna write?

103
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,228
What?

104
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,790
I was gonna write about my wet dream.

105
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,399
And?

106
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,913
I changed my mind.

107
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,069
Why?

108
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,234
Because I was afraid

109
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,913
teacher might've had the same dream.

110
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,513
Asshole!

111
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,033
So what did you write?

112
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,592
I wrote...

113
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,716
about a deep ocean fish...

114
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,597
which feeds on the dreams of kids.

115
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,830
When it's eaten 9,999 of them...

116
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,832
it will fly out of the sea.

117
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,273
And then?

118
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,038
If you glimpse it at daybreak...

119
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,235
you turn into a Super Fish-Man.

120
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,519
Man, aren't you going to Senior High?

121
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,237
What's all this crap

122
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,435
about fish and Fish-Men?

123
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,353
What goes on in your head?

124
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,790
How much are Green lsland submarine tours?

125
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,514
Are you serious about this?

126
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,513
Smoking?

127
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,599
Which school?

128
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,869
Lost your tongues?

129
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,078
Cheng Tao Junior High School.

130
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,153
Class?

131
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,671
Well?

132
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,311
Class 4, ninth grade.

133
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,874
Names?

134
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,393
Liu Chih-chiang.

135
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,079
Liu Chih-chiang.

136
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,399
You?

137
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,670
Hsu Wei-li.

138
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,191
Same class?

139
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,991
What's his name?

140
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,433
Liu Chih-chiang.

141
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,519
Phone number?

142
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,633
His is 767-8804.

143
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,909
Smart-ass!

144
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,991
And yours?

145
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,076
760-6451.

146
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,116
Don't lie to me!

147
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,992
Follow me.

148
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,635
Move it.

149
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,993
What happened?

150
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,991
The fucker touched me up.

151
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,797
He's coming...

152
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,639
Chih-chiang? This is Wei-li.

153
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,316
Has that guy called your dad?

154
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,677
No! Yours?

155
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,398
Not yet!

156
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,709
Fuck, I'm staying home tomorrow.

157
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,233
What about you?

158
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,869
I have to go to school.

159
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,191
Okay, tell teacher

160
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,315
I'm ill if she asks.

161
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,910
And if that guy calls...

162
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,674
... say that we were framed.

163
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,669
Got it?

164
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,114
Okay, got it.

165
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,999
Bye.

166
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,075
Yam fries, please.

167
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,513
Spicy?

168
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,430
Sure.

169
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,509
No, not on mine.

170
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,236
Okay.

171
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,196
How much is that?

172
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,315
$1 20.

173
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,519
Any money left?

174
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,671
I'll get it.

175
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,516
Thanks.

176
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,839
Got enough?

177
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,230
Then let's move! Bring your books.

178
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,673
$1 00.

179
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,199
He did better in History.

180
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,191
But not in Geography. See only 56!

181
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,519
He only had to memorize it.

182
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,750
It shows he didn't try hard enough!

183
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,434
And English, Math...

184
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,635
Ah, Liu, here you are!

185
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,077
Liu Chih-chiang's father?

186
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,149
Yes.

187
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,279
This is his last test result.

188
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,952
427.

189
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,831
Mr. Liu, don't be embarrassed about it.

190
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,912
These other parents

191
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,831
are in the same boat.

192
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,593
What I'm saying is...

193
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,353
all your children who are

194
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,316
sitting the Exam next month...

195
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,993
... will fail!

196
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,436
Chih-chiang!

197
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,114
These rooster testicles will do you good.

198
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,151
Good for what? It's hopeless.

199
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,070
You got a mark of only 400.

200
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,556
Do you want to study or not?

201
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,231
If not, what do you want?

202
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,233
You think you could be

203
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,196
a laborer or apprentice?

204
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,599
No one will want you.

205
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,117
Don't nag him over dinner!

206
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,153
You were the one who spoiled him!

207
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,188
It beats me.

208
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,833
Aren't you worried that he's backward?

209
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,831
What kind of mother are you?

210
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,437
You go to the next PTA meeting.

211
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,557
See if you don't feel ashamed.

212
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,839
Students!

213
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,717
This will be your last test here.

214
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,713
Do your best.

215
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,670
Now put away your books.

216
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,199
You knew all the answers

217
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,189
or just sat there?

218
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,559
What took you so long?

219
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,278
I didn't have a clue.

220
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,157
I'll never score higher than 400.

221
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,032
They say the last test seals your fate.

222
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,513
I'm doomed. Hey.

223
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,152
C'mon, it's over,

224
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,552
Iet's have fun.

225
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,319
How?

226
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,311
With this...

227
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,311
Hey, Chih-chiang.

228
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,319
Where's Dad?

229
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,239
He went to your school.

230
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,878
What for?

231
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,319
I don't know.

232
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,310
A case of kidnapping in Taipei.

233
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,958
7-year-old Wang Tao-nan

234
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,188
Ieft home yesterday,

235
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,553
and has not been seen since.

236
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,755
His family didn't notice his absence

237
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,318
until they received a ransom call

238
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,550
at noon today.

239
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,236
Head of the family...

240
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,514
Hey, Mom, Mom!

241
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,158
I know who kidnapped that kid!

242
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,438
Hey, Dad, look!

243
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,239
I know who kidnapped him!

244
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,636
Look at you rest result!

245
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,392
396!

246
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,438
Wei-li.

247
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,676
Wei-li, I'm going home.

248
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,998
Wei-li!

249
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,989
What the fuck?

250
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,712
Chih-chiang, run!

251
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,676
Stop!

252
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,033
Stop, you little asshole!

253
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,719
Now here's a letter from

254
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,039
Hsieh Fu-lai in Taichung.

255
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,713
He says a beautiful three-eyed girl

256
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,789
... appeared in his mirror...

257
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,597
... smiling at him...

258
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,831
... when he peeled an apple at midnight.

259
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,351
That's truly fascinating.

260
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,116
Back to the legends of King Saloman.

261
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,031
Saloman was bitten by the old shark

262
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,873
when he tried to rescue the princess.

263
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,518
Will he manage to escape?

264
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,557
We'll be back after this song.

265
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,556
On your feet!

266
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,671
You're asking for it.

267
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,999
Telephone number?

268
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,515
Don't fuck with me! The number!

269
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,031
767-8804.

270
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,075
Get that down.

271
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,431
767...

272
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,670
767...

273
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,318
8804!

274
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,672
Hello, Dad? I've been kidnapped.

275
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,999
How do you know?

276
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,075
Wei-li? No, this is for real.

277
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,990
There's...

278
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,154
Got it straight? I have your son.

279
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,720
If you want him back, get 5 million ready.

280
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,993
That's your problem! Listen carefully.

281
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,513
Put it in the trash can

282
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,034
outside Zhongxiao Theater.

283
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,632
5 million, at 1 pm tomorrow.

284
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,955
I warn you!

285
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,434
If the money isn't there,

286
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,759
or the cops show up,

287
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,512
get ready for your boy's funeral.

288
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,078
So, it's your show now.

289
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,354
Let's wait and see.

290
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,230
Are you worth 5 million to your dad?

291
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,439
What about the little one?

292
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,396
Shall we let him go?

293
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,038
You must be fucking crazy!

294
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,112
Free him to turn us in?

295
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,838
I'm not that bored with my life.

296
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,956
So what do we do?

297
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,273
His old man doesn't care.

298
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,838
He was adopted.

299
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,355
Never mind,

300
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,669
now this one's father is worried.

301
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,557
Stop gawking!

302
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,319
You too!

303
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,639
If your dad doesn't show up

304
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,675
with the cash,

305
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,318
it'll be curtains for you.

306
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,111
Help me with my glasses.

307
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,520
Stop kissing me!

308
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,278
Long time no see!

309
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,349
What's your line of work now?

310
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,236
What are you doing here?

311
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,309
Me? -What are you doing here?

312
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,276
I'm on duty.

313
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,075
No kidding!

314
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,830
Me? This is a stake out for a kidnap.

315
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,513
A kidnap? -Right!

316
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,673
A kidnap! Why are you here?

317
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,114
I'm on duty. How come you...

318
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,268
Hey, isn't that Tsai?

319
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,078
Sure it is!

320
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,276
And Chen's over there, the whole team.

321
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,315
It's chaos.

322
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,157
You've got a small army here.

323
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,115
Right!

324
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,837
Who are you out to nail?

325
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,599
Whoever picks up the ransom.

326
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,319
Nobody's showed up yet. -Not yet.

327
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,675
You're in construction?

328
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,749
You've made a fortune!

329
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,318
No, no. Who told you that?

330
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,916
Don't forget your old pals,

331
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,399
now you're rich.

332
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,355
I'll look you up when I retire.

333
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,833
See if you can give me a job.

334
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,194
Hell yes.

335
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,838
Make sure you do that.

336
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,317
So why are you here?

337
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:11,752
Who, me?

338
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,510
You! -You?

339
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,598
Yeah, what are you up to?

340
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,797
I'm meeting someone here.

341
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,030
So where's your friend?

342
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,679
What time is it?

343
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,910
He hasn't shown up? It's odd...

344
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,232
Can't talk now because I'm on duty.

345
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,194
I'll buy you a drink sometime

346
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,156
when I'm on leave.

347
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,309
Great!

348
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,034
Need any help now?

349
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,916
No, you've left this stuff behind.

350
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,319
We've enough support.

351
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,395
Well, I'll be off then.

352
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,037
OK!

353
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,953
Sorry about the rush, maybe we...

354
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,593
Say hello to Tsai for me.

355
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,430
Sure! I'll do.

356
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,550
Sorry. Hey, sorry.

357
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,074
Thank you.

358
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,990
Thank you. Bye.

359
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,033
I want to watch cartoons.

360
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,439
There's none on.

361
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,158
No cable TV here?

362
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,510
No. Eat this...

363
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,518
A man was knocked off

364
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,669
his motorcycle...

365
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,831
... and run over by a truck

366
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,068
alongside works...

367
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,358
... for the Mass Transit Railway

368
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,429
on Roosevelt Road.

369
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,271
The unfortunate victim died

370
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:14,996
immediately.

371
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,590
Deceased was Lai Mao-chun, aged 46...

372
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,555
An ex-policeman

373
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,790
now working in construction.

374
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,677
His next-of-kin have been informed.

375
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,110
Careful!

376
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,709
Come on, move it!

377
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,557
Takes two guys to carry one painting?

378
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,710
Hey, this is valuable old stuff.

379
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,756
Can you manage that alone?

380
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,351
Be careful...

381
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,316
A-ching, where have you been hiding?

382
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,435
Deep fuckin' asleep!

383
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,878
Yeah, too much sex!

384
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,233
Are you hungry?

385
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,673
What?

386
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,233
I'm so hungry.

387
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,838
Me too.

388
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,509
Where? Here?

389
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,993
Sorry, I'll rub it for you.

390
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,030
Hey, don't run away!

391
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,793
Bro, wait for me!

392
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,199
Where are you going?

393
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,073
Bro, wait for me!

394
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,510
Wait for me!

395
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,835
You'll get us into trouble...

396
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,989
Hurry up!

397
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,353
A-hsien!

398
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,076
Are you studying?

399
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,594
You gonna sit the test again?

400
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,713
No, wanna get a job.

401
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,875
Doing what?

402
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,116
Black Bull says I can collect debts for him.

403
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,751
Fuck that for a game of cobblers.

404
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,151
A-chun, long time no see.

405
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,909
Join us, it's been too long.

406
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,558
You haven't come for ages.

407
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,315
Come on, sit here.

408
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,150
A-chun, why isn't A-tsai with you?

409
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,280
He's working in Taipei?

410
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,633
That's good.

411
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,153
My A-ching works in Taipei, too.

412
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,957
Please ask A-tsai to take care of Ching

413
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,235
when you see him.

414
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,949
Do you know that man outside?

415
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,559
You don't!

416
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,831
Join us... sit here.

417
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,237
Let us feed ourselves.

418
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,151
We won't run away.

419
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,559
Alright, here.

420
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,313
How come they caught you too?

421
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,832
I was gonna rescue you.

422
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,672
Rescue me? You're that strong?

423
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,389
Heard of King Saloman?

424
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,993
I'm King Saloman, Super Fish-Man.

425
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,753
You're kidding.

426
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,798
If you're as good as you say...

427
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,677
... why didn't you get the bad guys?

428
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,279
I was on half-power.

429
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,598
Look, my power-unit is dead.

430
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,310
Wow! But what can we do now?

431
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,356
So we're gonna die for sure then?

432
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,678
Shall we try to get help?

433
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,151
Okay... Help! Help!

434
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,716
Okay, place your bets!

435
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,399
Hey, Hsiung!

436
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,833
A-ching! How are you doing?

437
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,875
Where's Auntie?

438
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,710
What is it?

439
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,560
Gonna talk to her.

440
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,635
Okay, hang on.

441
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,835
Be right there.

442
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,316
Lost again?

443
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,117
Fraid so! New game!

444
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,591
Lay your bets!

445
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,518
I'll give you two for 500,

446
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,714
it's good stuff.

447
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,836
Hey, look who's back!

448
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,958
A-ching, when did you get back?

449
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,314
This afternoon.

450
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,713
Doing well in Taipei?

451
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,438
Not too great.

452
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,156
Looking for your aunt? -Yeah.

453
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,354
She's inside.

454
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,679
Mom's inside

455
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,114
It's a swindle.

456
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,315
In that costume at your age...

457
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,518
Shut the fuck up.

458
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,397
You chose to buy the ticket.

459
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,833
Did anyone drag you in here?

460
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,956
Go look at your own mother.

461
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,674
You curse my mother?

462
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,033
Yes, so what?

463
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,519
Time's up, out you go.

464
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,999
Crazy! -It's a con!

465
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,030
Nobody forced you in.

466
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,756
I'm going to the police.

467
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,518
Go ahead, asshole! Whatever you want.

468
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,911
Nobody's stopping you!

469
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,515
I'm earning an honest penny here!

470
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,839
Auntie, I need to talk to you.

471
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,956
A-ching? Wait outside.

472
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,995
I'll just get changed.

473
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,750
Okay.

474
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,356
A-ching, choose one for yourself.

475
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,913
What's the problem?

476
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,114
I'll tell you...

477
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,595
Yes?

478
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,509
Quality clothing, Miss.

479
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,230
Two for 500, or 290 for one. Alright?

480
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,515
Department store quality.

481
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,988
Pack up, Ming-chu, we're going home.

482
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,910
What's up, Mom?

483
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,559
Tell you later, where's A-hsiung?

484
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,309
A-hsiung, we're leaving!

485
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,399
Still gambling?

486
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,312
You play while we do all the work.

487
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,309
You'll die gambling.

488
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,275
I didn't bet much.

489
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,392
Empty pockets, that's why.

490
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,515
I've told you...

491
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,670
We're going broke

492
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,999
because you never work hard.

493
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,800
Nobody buys this con-trick any more.

494
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,155
Says who?

495
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,798
Just as well we don't rely on you.

496
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,552
Or we'd have starved to death.

497
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,159
But this whole thing was your idea.

498
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,670
What's eating you?

499
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,432
Told you not to wear sunglasses!

500
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,509
You're clueless!

501
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,153
This way, nobody will recognize me.

502
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,315
Fool!

503
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,389
Let me look!

504
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,553
Looks so stupid,

505
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,232
no wonder he got kidnapped.

506
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,516
I've never seen a kidnap victim before.

507
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,151
Auntie, what shall we do now?

508
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,908
Bring them home.

509
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:01,956
Bring them home?

510
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,837
Too dangerous out here.

511
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,432
Help me, A-hsiung,

512
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,555
we'll take them home.

513
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,117
Okay.

514
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,958
What the hell are you doing?

515
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,951
Get the light off my face!

516
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,193
Delicious!

517
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,389
Really good!

518
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,352
Not bad!

519
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,793
I want a hamburger.

520
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,392
Keep your voice down, damn you.

521
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,516
Isn't this good enough for you?

522
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,556
Shut up! Another word from you

523
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,356
and I'll make hamburger

524
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,156
from your willie.

525
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,149
Eat up!

526
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,998
A-chuan, come and join us.

527
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,194
You're such a good cook.

528
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,236
Don't stay in the kitchen.

529
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,235
My dear in-law, do join us!

530
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,353
Congratulations!

531
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,955
Grandma, it's these two.

532
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,918
These two are your sons?

533
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,672
Such dear boys.

534
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,231
She's lost it again.

535
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,549
Over here, Grandma.

536
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,159
What?

537
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,594
Whose slipper is this?

538
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,192
Looks like mine.

539
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,750
Are you eating with your feet?

540
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,394
A-ching,

541
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,550
when will the water go down?

542
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,115
Dunno! Sometimes it takes a day.

543
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,678
But sometimes it might take days.

544
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,155
What caused this anyhow?

545
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,317
Maybe the dam?

546
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,958
I really don't know.

547
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,238
Yeah, it's because the dam broke.

548
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,355
It's our irrigation system.

549
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,510
Water can't flow out.

550
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,954
Listen to Mr. Scholar!

551
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,995
Why isn't it fixed?

552
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,194
Why don't you complain about it?

553
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,919
No point, no-one's smart around here.

554
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,990
At least you got that right.

555
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,637
That's why I asked to study.

556
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,073
But you quit school!

557
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:40,837
A-chang,

558
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,114
Iet's see the TV news.

559
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,235
Okay.

560
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,834
Singer Lu Fei was mobbed

561
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,831
by fans at his concert.

562
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,274
One woman fainted in the crush.

563
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,110
But happily

564
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,553
she regained consciousness

565
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,233
after being rushed to hospital.

566
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:00,316
Lu Fei! Lu Fei!

567
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,398
Events really have a way of telling us

568
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,719
what a kaleidoscopic modern world

569
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,994
we live in.

570
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,197
What's up?

571
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,269
Relax,

572
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,271
we won't hurt you.

573
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,599
We'll free you

574
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,318
when your dad coughs up.

575
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,113
Why the tears?

576
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,838
Didn't you hear me?

577
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,872
Auntie,

578
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,634
he's a bit hard of hearing.

579
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,190
One dumb

580
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,758
and the other deaf.

581
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,318
If I were your dad,

582
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,709
I wouldn't pay.

583
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,154
It's now three days

584
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,912
since Liu Chih-chiang was kidnapped.

585
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,831
But there are no new leads.

586
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,875
The police suspect a link

587
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,155
between this case,

588
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,276
and the kidnap of another school boy

589
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,235
Wang Tao-nan.

590
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,832
The kidnapper telephoned only once

591
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,149
on the day that Liu was taken.

592
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:08,990
The police have issued

593
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,718
this picture of Liu Chih-chiang.

594
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,790
Any citizen who sights Liu Chih-chiang

595
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,189
is requested to contact...

596
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,350
Not a bad picture of you.

597
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,510
He looks better in the flesh.

598
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,158
Not much difference.

599
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,037
Why are you crying?

600
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,075
You sound like a

601
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,117
professional funeral wailer.

602
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,317
That's enough.

603
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,390
Let's clear up, it's bedtime.

604
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,152
I wanna pee.

605
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,038
Pee anywhere you want!

606
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,838
We're underwater anyway.

607
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,431
Are you stronger than

608
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,795
the four invincible kings?

609
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,434
God damn it, go to sleep!

610
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,069
Auntie, where do we go from here?

611
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,150
How do we get him back to Taipei?

612
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,755
Hell, we can't let him go now.

613
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:23,757
Didn't you promise

614
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,069
to take the family to Taipei and

615
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,957
support your brother's schooling?

616
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,871
And what about your Grandma...

617
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:32,597
I'm totally lost.

618
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,160
The kidnapping was my boss's idea.

619
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,594
Now he's dead.

620
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,158
This wasn't my plan in the first place.

621
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:39,990
Don't worry.

622
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,072
I'll help you out.

623
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,233
These kids will bring us a fortune,

624
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:45,752
won't they?

625
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,309
Nah, the little one is worth nothing.

626
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,116
How come?

627
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,151
His dad doesn't want him.

628
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,549
What kind of father is he?

629
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,357
I learned it later.

630
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,032
He's not his real dad.

631
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,395
His mother had him

632
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,038
by an earlier boyfriend.

633
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,833
Then that guy took off.

634
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,434
His mother married this other guy.

635
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,148
She killed herself few years back.

636
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:12,152
Killed herself? Why?

637
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,831
Because he treated her badly.

638
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,878
And he took a mistress.

639
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,353
So he's really not his dad.

640
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,839
The kid is an orphan now.

641
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,716
poor little thing.

642
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,029
This father has no heart at all.

643
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,029
Right!

644
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,237
He had dealings with my boss.

645
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,317
He cheated my boss.

646
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,958
That's why he took the kid.

647
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,191
The man doesn't want the kid back.

648
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,796
He's happy that we took him!

649
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:45,797
Such misfortune.

650
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,756
And he's so cute.

651
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,231
The ninth grade student

652
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,515
Liu Chih-chiang is absent

653
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,393
because he has been kidnapped.

654
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,554
So that he could not be with us today.

655
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,152
I'm sure we all share the same sorrow.

656
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,952
We condemn the wrong-doers.

657
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,111
And sincerely trust that

658
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,951
all of you here today

659
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:26,836
will never stray from

660
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,717
the path of righteousness.

661
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,958
Shall we observe one minute's silence

662
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,552
for Liu Chih-chiang.

663
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,550
We pray for his safe return.

664
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,796
Ming-chu!

665
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,351
Stop!

666
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,640
You want to shake your baby out?

667
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,832
Go get some rest!

668
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,794
See that?

669
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,394
She could go into labor any minute.

670
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,676
And she's jumping around like a child.

671
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,914
That little one might try to escape.

672
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,111
He wouldn't dare.

673
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,076
Don't be so sure.

674
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,995
Maybe the other one is an orphan too?

675
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,198
No, he isn't.

676
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,997
I know he has a father.

677
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,149
Certain?

678
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:53,990
Yeah!

679
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,276
Look, another update on TV.

680
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,792
Our Chih-chiang has always been

681
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,279
a weak child.

682
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,835
Please be kind to him.

683
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,195
He loves sausages

684
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,269
and preserved eggs.

685
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,152
Have a heart, feed him well, please.

686
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,430
Chih-chiang,

687
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,557
who were all those letters to?

688
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,832
I beg his captors to set my boy free!

689
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,151
I'll do whatever you tell me to!

690
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,037
I promise I will do. No matter what.

691
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,235
Please give him back to me.

692
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,869
The Joint Entrance Exam

693
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,438
is only ten days away.

694
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,318
If he isn't back, he'll miss it!

695
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,117
I beg of you!

696
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,513
Who are you criminals working for?

697
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,150
Explain to me what you want!

698
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,151
You can't just abduct kids like this!

699
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,351
Talk to me city councilors candidate

700
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,679
Hsu Huo-tu.

701
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,870
My doors are open to you.

702
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,351
Liu Chih-chiang is a fine student.

703
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,556
He is well behaved.

704
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,592
He doesn't talk much,

705
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,919
and gets good grades.

706
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,515
He has a bright future.

707
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,511
The police call for the immediate release

708
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,873
of the captives.

709
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,108
According to the police...

710
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,030
Auntie.

711
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,837
Let's have a word inside.

712
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,829
What is it?

713
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,558
Come inside!

714
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,194
What is it?

715
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,797
I'm sorry.

716
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,999
I'd have let you go

717
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,672
if I'd known about the Exam.

718
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,190
But now you're here!

719
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,316
Can't just let you go!

720
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,639
But never mind.

721
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,153
You can study here.

722
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,434
I'll take you home

723
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,158
when we get the cash.

724
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:06,353
Work at it, Chih-chiang!

725
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,794
Don't end up useless, like me.

726
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,799
You can start right away!

727
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:11,392
Oh...

728
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:12,915
Right!

729
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,835
See here, Chih-chiang!

730
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,271
Maybe you can use

731
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,759
these books of A-chuan's.

732
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,800
Geography, History, you name it.

733
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,274
If there's not enough,

734
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,998
I can buy more in Chiayi City.

735
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,357
See all those A-chuan underlined?

736
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,392
She used to study hard.

737
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,679
Eight!

738
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,709
Your turn.

739
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,109
A-hsien, who are those kids?

740
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,276
Can't tell you now.

741
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,271
But we're gonna get rich.

742
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,952
We'll move to Taipei...

743
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,996
No more floods!

744
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,879
It doesn't flood in Taipei?

745
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,710
Dope! You think

746
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,551
the President's Palace floods?

747
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,312
Eighteen!

748
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,390
Show your cards.

749
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,389
You didn't see them.

750
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,231
Why'd you have to show her?

751
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,355
What's going on here?

752
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,110
What are you looking at?

753
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,109
Who can play with her?

754
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,988
Are these the right books?

755
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,839
I got them in Chiayi City.

756
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,273
It's Math?

757
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,838
How's it going?

758
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,156
If you don't get it, write it down.

759
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,718
I can ask someone in the village.

760
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,551
Mr. Lin is very good

761
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,959
in Chinese studies.

762
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,675
And I think he knows Math too.

763
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,437
I can ask him anything you don't get.

764
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,157
Mrs. Lin, is Mr. Lin home?

765
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,956
I got the answer, Chih-chiang.

766
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,039
I'll explain...

767
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,239
Mr. Lin says... this is...

768
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,709
In the triangle ABC...

769
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,312
Because... well...

770
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:19,675
The angle ACB equals...

771
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,711
Is greater than...

772
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:28,552
Therefore angle E...

773
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,155
Hang on, I'll ask him again.

774
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,188
How old are these?

775
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,316
Eat quietly.

776
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,118
You sound like a pig in a trough.

777
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,317
You like my idea?

778
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:52,959
No, too dangerous!

779
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,075
Dongshi Township is too small

780
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,559
for us to keep it secret.

781
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:56,311
No it ain't.

782
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,072
What danger?

783
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,231
Old Hui shot it!

784
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,356
Never seen such a big fish!

785
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,395
Grandma,

786
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:09,153
we're talking about the ransom.

787
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,594
We're not shooting fish.

788
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,749
Dangerous or not.

789
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:12,636
You know,

790
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,758
Old Hui died in an accident.

791
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,038
Grandma, you live in a different world!

792
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,679
Where the hell have we got to?

793
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,116
A-ching, I've been thinking...

794
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:29,238
We can't risk getting this wrong.

795
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,756
They'll shoot us if we screw up.

796
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:33,715
You don't know?

797
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,039
It's death penalty!

798
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,030
Let's think about this.

799
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,600
The Exam is few days away...

800
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,875
I don't think Chih-chiang

801
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:43,756
is gonna make it in the Exam.

802
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:44,233
Why not?

803
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,196
If he studies hard when he's home...

804
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,150
That's right.

805
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,674
He can study hard here, can't he?

806
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,240
And it's quieter here.

807
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,952
What I mean is...

808
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,155
There's still several days to go.

809
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,513
All we must do is clinch the deal

810
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,509
before the big day.

811
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,111
Right?

812
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,156
Okay.

813
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:01,510
Okay, my ass!

814
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,839
You're so useless.

815
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,678
What's the big deal here?

816
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,908
Who cares if he passes or fails?

817
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:06,750
If I were you...

818
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,239
Well? What?

819
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:09,715
He brought them here,

820
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:10,755
nothing to do with you.

821
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,636
Shut up!

822
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:12,834
We'd be right to take heed.

823
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,353
That's what we should do.

824
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,679
We shouldn't rush.

825
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,113
We should take heed.

826
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,953
Old Hui failed to take heed.

827
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,428
That's why he was struck by that car.

828
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,839
She's off again.

829
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,559
Ma, who is this Old Hui?

830
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,159
How should I know?

831
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,150
She's bad enough

832
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,309
and you're dancing to her tune?

833
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,230
Talk about Old Hui...

834
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,798
Let's postpone

835
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,631
the rest of this discussion.

836
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,991
Sure, why not?

837
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,356
Get some beer, A-chang.

838
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,309
C'mon, let's play again.

839
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,431
Are you serious?

840
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,953
It'll cure your headache!

841
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,272
Play again?

842
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,317
Sure. -Think you can win some back?

843
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,596
No way,

844
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,397
just don't lose your ass!

845
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,833
Who's losing what?

846
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:53,870
Let's play then!

847
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,199
No problem!

848
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,349
Make some space here.

849
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,076
Ming-chu,

850
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,354
clear this mess away.

851
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,959
Sit on those papers.

852
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,029
Put it away!

853
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:02,197
It's so bitter!

854
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,758
You like this bitter taste?

855
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,115
Come on.

856
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,109
Deal me in.

857
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,792
You want her in, too?

858
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,831
As I bought this book...

859
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:33,878
The bookseller found his bird dead.

860
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:40,399
Yesterday it sang, today it's gone forever.

861
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,956
Life just slips away.

862
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:51,399
Just as my youth will slip away.

863
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:06,118
Are you through in there, Sis?

864
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:12,869
What the hell's taking so long?

865
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,353
"A-chuan,

866
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:33,033
why don't you speak to me? "

867
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,998
"l am the summer slipping into autumn"

868
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,794
"You can revive me from hibernation"

869
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:42,110
"l am the dust you stir up"

870
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,790
"A-chuan..."

871
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,396
I knew you had the hots for her.

872
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,910
You fancy getting clobbered?

873
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,229
Piss off!

874
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,557
Only ten days to go to the Exam.

875
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:21,709
I'm sure that all students

876
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,711
are striving their utmost.

877
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,313
All of them know that the Exam...

878
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,311
... is crucial for their futures.

879
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,956
But for Liu who has been missing

880
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,554
for more than ten days,

881
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,320
will he have a future?

882
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,876
This must be a concern for all of us.

883
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,912
This morning his father and

884
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,319
Councilor Yang delivered a petition

885
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:45,790
to the Education Dept..

886
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,951
asking for the boy to be exempted the Exam.

887
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,674
I entrusted my boy to the school.

888
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,795
Now my boy's been kidnapped.

889
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:55,550
I wonder...

890
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:00,034
...doesn't the school have a duty?

891
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,832
The Exam is approaching

892
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,756
but my boy has been denied

893
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,432
access to his books.

894
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,957
Who will compensate him?

895
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,591
What if he's not back for the Exam?

896
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:18,510
Wouldn't that be unjust?

897
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:28,433
Tired? Let's hit the beach.

898
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,433
That tickles!

899
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,518
How was the beach?

900
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:17,555
Great!

901
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,630
Beautiful tropical fish in the sea!

902
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,239
What bullshit are you talking now?

903
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,958
We don't have tropical fish here.

904
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,549
The sea's full of them!

905
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,272
You're a bigger liar than I am.

906
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,599
Ain't no tropical fish on this coast.

907
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,953
They're all in the South.

908
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,110
You have to go to Kending.

909
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,918
Don't even know that!

910
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:37,839
Dunno what they teach you in school.

911
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:40,958
You're pig ignorant.

912
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,873
Okay, enough, eat your meal.

913
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:06,750
When can you recharge your power-unit?

914
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,672
I need sea-water.

915
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:16,115
It contains idiotic potassium.

916
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,439
I need that for my recharge.

917
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,915
To regain my super-powers.

918
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:27,749
The ocean is so mysterious.

919
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:31,275
There are things we can't see

920
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,032
or even imagine.

921
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:41,117
Bro, will you tell me a story?

922
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,752
Okay.

923
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,070
In the deepest part of the sea...

924
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,799
... there's a weird-looking fish.

925
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:54,195
It feeds on children's dreams.

926
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:58,072
When it has eaten 9,999 of them,

927
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:01,232
it will fly out of the sea on wings.

928
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,592
If you happen to be out at sea...

929
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:07,752
... as the sun comes up...

930
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:12,388
... shout out "I'm a fish!"

931
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,750
Then that winged fish will fly up...

932
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:15,870
... and take you on a trip

933
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,074
through the sea...

934
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:22,792
...right to the ends of that world.

935
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:26,275
And in the Dragon King's palace...

936
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:30,151
... it will feed you a red pearl.

937
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,591
And once you've eaten it...

938
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,671
... you'll become King Saloman.

939
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,879
Then you'll be so bright.

940
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,153
You'll be top of your class.

941
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,919
Hey, A-ching!

942
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,438
You're back?

943
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,112
Didn't look me up?

944
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,758
A-fu, long time no see!

945
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:34,795
No kidding.

946
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,399
Have a smoke.

947
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,391
Putting on weight!

948
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:39,873
And very tanned!

949
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,394
Really?

950
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:43,869
Fishing?

951
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,279
Who are those two kids?

952
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:58,071
Those two kids...

953
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,073
They're...

954
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,751
...my friend's sons.

955
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,791
Their parents went abroad

956
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,552
so I took them back.

957
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:11,353
How are you doing in Taipei?

958
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,509
I hear you're getting rich.

959
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,592
Nah, can't earn much as a laborer.

960
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,275
You do better than me on your salary.

961
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,068
Then come back and work the boats!

962
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,674
Fishing's hard work,

963
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:26,638
but the hours are flexible.

964
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,912
Everyone's leaving,

965
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,717
I get so bored here.

966
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:33,590
How long before you go back to Taipei?

967
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,109
Are you going back?

968
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,678
I'll leave in a couple of days.

969
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:38,396
Really?

970
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,278
Look me up before you go.

971
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,633
We'll catch up properly.

972
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:42,959
I will do.

973
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,359
Gotta start my shift now.

974
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,953
Okay...

975
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:47,349
Bye! -Bye!

976
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,509
Don't forget!

977
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,354
Sure... see ya!

978
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,788
A-chuan!

979
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,798
A-chuan!

980
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:04,436
Bro,

981
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:07,518
when will you be recharged?

982
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,752
It takes time.

983
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,829
There are only five days to the Exam.

984
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:16,870
The police believe that

985
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,519
Liu Chih-chiang is still alive.

986
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,238
This station has received

987
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,992
countless calls...

988
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,753
... expressing concern for his fate.

989
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,037
Our callers are all praying...

990
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,713
... for his safe return

991
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,153
in time for the Exam.

992
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,437
One, two, three.

993
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:35,509
Ming-chu,

994
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,597
take some rest.

995
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,398
The doctor told me to exercise.

996
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,628
A-hsiung!

997
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,037
The Exam's only five days away!

998
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,516
Are you blind?

999
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,112
You just sat on my foot!

1000
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:49,677
I'm sorry.

1001
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,439
There's only five days left.

1002
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,839
We gotta think what to do.

1003
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:53,556
We're running out of time.

1004
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:56,075
I've been trying to think!

1005
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,399
You think I like this waiting around?

1006
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,197
You have to think of something

1007
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,599
The main thing is...

1008
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,271
... to fix the time

1009
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:01,917
and place for the handover.

1010
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,435
Then we can call his father.

1011
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,319
How mush should we demand?

1012
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:07,913
One million?

1013
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,393
Just one million?

1014
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,755
Are we running a charity here?

1015
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,038
At least two million,

1016
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,075
Ieave room to bargain.

1017
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,073
Bargaining over two million?

1018
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:19,276
Why not demand five and then bargain?

1019
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,599
Idiot!

1020
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:22,717
Okay, let's go for five million.

1021
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,797
Where will we make the switch?

1022
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:26,756
Betel nuts!

1023
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:29,752
Old Hui liked betel nuts!

1024
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,119
Having mentioned betel nuts...

1025
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,951
I know a guy who sells betel nuts.

1026
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,518
I have an idea.

1027
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:49,795
Hsiung. -What?

1028
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,916
When did you last see him?

1029
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,399
I wonder if he's still in business.

1030
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,799
The stall looks deserted.

1031
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,793
We did military service together.

1032
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,109
Haven't seen him since we got out.

1033
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,273
You mean 20 or 30 years ago?

1034
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:03,999
What? Don't exaggerate!

1035
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,718
We spoke to each other two years ago!

1036
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,316
Did you get the address right?

1037
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,799
We've been waiting for an hour.

1038
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:10,836
This is it!

1039
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:12,751
Zhongzheng Rd. Betel Nuts!

1040
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,432
There's no mistake!

1041
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:16,317
Many Zhongzheng Rd. in Taiwan.

1042
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,072
None of your business, kid.

1043
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,194
It sure is his business!

1044
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:25,312
A-hsiung, it's too hot in here.

1045
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:26,590
Enough of this waiting.

1046
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,079
Let's go home.

1047
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:29,429
All right.

1048
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,509
I'll call A-ching.

1049
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,710
A-ching! We're giving up!

1050
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:36,670
Damn!

1051
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,315
Are you through?

1052
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:51,072
I'm trying to do business here.

1053
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,509
Sorry, just a bit longer.

1054
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:57,792
Mr. Liu, I'm afraid we must give up.

1055
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,752
I've checked.

1056
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:02,069
I think this is the wrong place.

1057
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,308
There are many betel nut stalls

1058
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:04,275
on this road.

1059
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,998
We have many men on the case.

1060
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,511
You go home first.

1061
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,511
Maybe the kidnappers will call again.

1062
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:14,993
Don't you worry, go on home.

1063
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,035
I'll take care of things here.

1064
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,359
I'll go check. You go home.

1065
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:17,997
It's okay.

1066
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,070
Call it off.

1067
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:22,594
Thank you.

1068
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:24,835
One pack of betel nuts!

1069
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:27,238
Call it off.

1070
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,272
Fuck, if I get through

1071
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,236
I'll add a million

1072
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:49,310
and curse the shit out of them!

1073
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:50,676
Right!

1074
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,428
Hey, aren't they cops?

1075
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,069
Uh-oh...

1076
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:06,113
A new development in the Liu kidnapping.

1077
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,628
The abductor called

1078
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:08,914
his parents yesterday

1079
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:11,957
and demand five million in cash

1080
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,359
at a betel nut stall

1081
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,079
on Zhongzheng Road.

1082
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,157
The kidnappers are now

1083
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,752
known to be a gang.

1084
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:20,597
Yesterday's caller

1085
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:23,512
was not the man who called before.

1086
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:25,232
Here is the recording of the call.

1087
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:27,949
Hello, Mr. Liu?

1088
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,352
Fuck, lousy pictures!

1089
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:34,038
You want money or your son?

1090
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:35,229
But I feel...

1091
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,196
You son's life is worth more...

1092
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:38,795
So I feel...

1093
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:43,590
You son's life is worth more, right?

1094
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:44,750
Cut the crap!

1095
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,830
Get to the point!

1096
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:51,109
Mr. Liu, let me tell you.

1097
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:53,276
We have your son here.

1098
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,032
Get five million ready in cash.

1099
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,917
Or we won't be responsible

1100
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,433
for his safety.

1101
01:14:58,440 --> 01:14:59,589
Let me hear!

1102
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,794
Don't snatch the phone!

1103
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,074
Old Hui,

1104
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,672
why not come over for a drink?

1105
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:04,715
Hell!

1106
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,912
A-ching, take her home!

1107
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,672
Hello Mr. Liu?

1108
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,238
Did you hear me?

1109
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:12,071
Yes, yes!

1110
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:12,990
So it's a deal.

1111
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,275
Have five million ready tomorrow.

1112
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:16,999
Be at the betel nut stand

1113
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:17,830
on Zhongzheng Road.

1114
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,671
We'll meet you there.

1115
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:21,599
At what time?

1116
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,354
Four... four o'clock.

1117
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,157
Ming-chu, will four be too late?

1118
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,149
No.

1119
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,913
Okay, four it is.

1120
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,113
A-chang, anything else to say?

1121
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,231
Quick, we're almost out of change.

1122
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:34,231
Ma, you can't mention Chang's name!

1123
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,798
You've given us away!

1124
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:36,437
Damn!

1125
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,319
Hello Mr. Li,

1126
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,435
you got all the details?

1127
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:42,591
Tomorrow, four o'clock! Bye!

1128
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,513
Ming-chu sounded the worst.

1129
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,034
You think you sounded better?

1130
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:49,112
To think we all got on TV!

1131
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,913
Although it sounded like a prank call,

1132
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,036
the police have gleaned some clues.

1133
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:57,079
The police believe the mastermind

1134
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:59,674
to be a man named Old Hui.

1135
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:01,109
The call was traced to

1136
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,998
the village of Dongshi.

1137
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:07,397
The police are now combing the area.

1138
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,239
They expect to find the boy

1139
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,309
before the Exam date.

1140
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,116
How'd they manage that?

1141
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,519
What shall we do?

1142
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,276
Bro, the place is crawling with cops.

1143
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,998
They're questioning A-fu.

1144
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,149
We're done for!

1145
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:20,310
A-fu has seen the two kids!

1146
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:21,635
Auntie, what shall we do?

1147
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,631
It's not safe here!

1148
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:24,629
Think of something!

1149
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,358
Where can we hide them?

1150
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:27,918
Grandma, what do you think?

1151
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,276
What do you think she knows about it?

1152
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:35,550
Let's send them out to sea on a boat.

1153
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:36,796
Out to sea?

1154
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,279
That's not a bad idea!

1155
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,396
Right, we know the sea

1156
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,958
Yeah! -Right, out to sea!

1157
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,433
Shut up, you kids.

1158
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,514
What about a boat? -Boat...

1159
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:46,555
Where are my schoolbooks?

1160
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,592
What have you done with my books?

1161
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,158
Chih-chiang has them.

1162
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,912
He's taking the Exam.

1163
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,631
What the hell?

1164
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,199
A-chuan's acting strangely.

1165
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,270
He's had her books for days already!

1166
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,269
Now you're looking for your books?

1167
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:03,399
By what right did you take my books?

1168
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:04,355
A-chuan!

1169
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:05,156
By what right?

1170
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,036
A-chuan!

1171
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,195
By what right?

1172
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,394
Stop it! Stop it!

1173
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,075
You hit me?

1174
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,239
You dare hit me?

1175
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,758
I ended up like this

1176
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,393
because you forced me to quit school.

1177
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,671
People look down on me.

1178
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,068
Do I deserve this?

1179
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,870
A-chuan, don't!

1180
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,916
Ming-chu, look after her.

1181
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,871
Who are those two?

1182
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,233
Why are they fighting?

1183
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:21,309
Black Carp,

1184
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:24,357
do you read me? Over.

1185
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:26,272
Black Carp,

1186
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:28,999
do you read me? Over.

1187
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:30,836
Red Dragon,

1188
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:33,400
this is Black Carp. Over.

1189
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,319
Had breakfast yet?

1190
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:36,755
Not yet.

1191
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,038
A-chang is so dumb.

1192
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,359
Sending you off with books

1193
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:41,952
but no food.

1194
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,879
Is Chih-chiang studying?

1195
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:47,871
Yes, studying English now.

1196
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,633
Good.

1197
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:51,312
But what are you going to eat?

1198
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:54,919
A-hsiung has a fishing rod.

1199
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:56,558
Says he'll catch something.

1200
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:58,229
No problem!

1201
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,117
So we'll be having sashimi soon.

1202
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,079
Auntie, the food doesn't matter.

1203
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:02,512
The main thing is...

1204
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,670
Have you called the parents?

1205
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,837
We'll dock when you hear from them.

1206
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:08,676
All right.

1207
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:11,755
Don't worry.

1208
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,354
A-hsien has gone to call them.

1209
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:16,556
We'll know soon.

1210
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:19,310
Tell Chih-chiang to study hard.

1211
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,630
Read you! Bye! Over

1212
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:24,875
Bye!

1213
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,397
This walkie-talkie is quite useful.

1214
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,638
Did you get through?

1215
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,232
The line's always busy.

1216
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:33,318
Go and try again.

1217
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,919
I've tried many times.

1218
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:36,148
Just do it.

1219
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:37,832
Go on!

1220
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,592
What a weird family...

1221
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,831
Talking on the phone for so long.

1222
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,078
Get in!

1223
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,433
Old Hui has gone South!

1224
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:49,716
We're ordered to trace him,

1225
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:50,630
got it?

1226
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:52,559
Get in!

1227
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:09,676
Shit, we two always get left behind.

1228
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:12,669
What?

1229
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,234
You'd rather be in the firing line?

1230
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,750
Get a move on!

1231
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:37,759
Where to?

1232
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,751
"Snow White's Sex-Crazed Sister"

1233
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,637
Fuck, what is it?

1234
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:58,752
Snow White's sister?

1235
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,639
Lucky I found this...

1236
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,149
... or I'd die of hunger.

1237
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:04,559
Thought you were an expert?

1238
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:05,754
What have you caught?

1239
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,837
How can Chih-chiang study

1240
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,239
when he's hungry?

1241
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,398
I'm doing my best.

1242
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:15,194
Fuck! The fish just aren't biting.

1243
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:16,758
Anyway, show some respect!

1244
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:18,910
I'm trying to feed us all.

1245
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:20,510
Chih-chiang!

1246
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,030
Coming.

1247
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,192
Uncle Hsiung, what's that?

1248
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:35,394
Shit!

1249
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,833
Why?

1250
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:39,310
Because I'm full of it.

1251
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,913
Only when King Saloman was taken

1252
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:48,195
did he realize the Mermaid Princess

1253
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:52,239
was the shark's sister.

1254
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:56,036
The Sea Monster snatched the princess.

1255
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:00,109
So Saloman and the shark teamed up

1256
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,190
in a bid to rescue her

1257
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,758
from the sea monster.

1258
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,552
What will happen next?

1259
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:07,154
But first,

1260
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:08,912
Iet's pause for a letter.

1261
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,197
Chen Hsiao-tung from Hualien

1262
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,997
writes to say

1263
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:16,153
there's a little green man

1264
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:18,230
in his uncle's guitar.

1265
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,556
And whenever his uncle plays it,

1266
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:24,997
the little green man sings along.

1267
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,436
But it's been a while

1268
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,317
since he heard him.

1269
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:32,596
His uncle married and stopped playing.

1270
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:32,310
Come on, whip it out! -Excuse me?

1271
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:33,799
Haven't got one? -Here!

1272
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:36,519
A club! I knew yours was small!

1273
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,314
See, I got a big spade!

1274
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:40,594
Enough!

1275
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,109
How can you play

1276
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:43,155
at a time like this?

1277
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:45,435
You're driving me crazy! Stop it.

1278
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,438
Pay attention!

1279
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,159
Okay, okay.

1280
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:53,352
A-hsien, did you try to call?

1281
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:54,270
Sure.

1282
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:56,077
There's only one day left!

1283
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:58,071
You didn't play the fruit machine?

1284
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,311
No, I've still got your coin.

1285
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:04,876
See, it's the same coin, made in 1 981!

1286
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:06,709
Maybe you're dialing the wrong number?

1287
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,711
No way. I wrote it on my hand!

1288
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,678
767-8804...

1289
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:11,510
Right!

1290
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:13,949
Strange, huh?

1291
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:14,751
It's the right number.

1292
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,079
Why can't you get through?

1293
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,513
How should I know?

1294
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,275
This is killing me.

1295
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:27,235
Shit, only these two tiddlers all day!

1296
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:28,957
Shame on you.

1297
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:31,190
Not exactly a sashimi dinner.

1298
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,669
Is there any mustard?

1299
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:33,192
Nope.

1300
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:36,073
You're lucky we found this soy sauce!

1301
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:38,596
This is not a Japanese restaurant!

1302
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:41,076
Chih-chiang, have some.

1303
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:44,273
Aren't you hungry?

1304
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,194
Hsiung! -What?

1305
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:48,077
Get A-chang to bring some food out.

1306
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:50,753
No, what if the cops see him?

1307
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:52,079
So we starve to death.

1308
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,399
No we won't.

1309
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,789
I'll try the walkie-talkie.

1310
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,791
Yeah, give it a try.

1311
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:02,996
Red Dragon,

1312
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,911
this is Black Carp calling.

1313
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:10,278
Do you read me? Over.

1314
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:12,909
Well?

1315
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:17,593
Red Dragon, do you read me?

1316
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:22,078
Shit, may be the battery.

1317
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:23,594
Oh no!

1318
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:30,275
Red Dragon...

1319
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:32,510
this is Black Carp calling...

1320
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:34,238
Hey,

1321
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:36,390
Let's get up for tomorrow's sunrise

1322
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:37,596
Why?

1323
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:39,350
Because that's

1324
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,920
when the winged fish flies up!

1325
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:44,513
Oh, right!

1326
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,068
Uncle Ching!

1327
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,073
Can you wake us

1328
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:50,593
before dawn tomorrow?

1329
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:52,515
Why?

1330
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:53,748
I want to watch the sun rise.

1331
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:54,596
Watch the sun rise?

1332
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,512
You can watch that from heaven!

1333
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,272
Okay, I'll wake you.

1334
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:16,839
Get up!

1335
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,519
Get up, dawn's coming!

1336
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,278
Bro, get up!

1337
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:39,033
It's nearly dawn!

1338
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:43,030
How long to go?

1339
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:47,993
Not long, see that light coming?

1340
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,916
Will the winged fish show up?

1341
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,272
Sure, if you're sincere.

1342
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:56,312
And if fate allows.

1343
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,394
Okay.

1344
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,391
Here it comes!

1345
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:18,309
I'm a fish!

1346
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:22,714
What's all this?

1347
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:34,318
I'm a fish!

1348
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,112
What's that sound?

1349
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,552
The winged fish is coming.

1350
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:43,077
Fly to me!

1351
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:57,913
This way!

1352
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,312
This is the last day before the Exam.

1353
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:12,790
There are less than 20 hours to go.

1354
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:16,234
Keep watching for regular updates.

1355
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:20,193
Now we cross to

1356
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,589
an interview with the police.

1357
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:24,753
This is Chen Shih-chieh reporting

1358
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:25,636
from Dongshi Township.

1359
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:27,551
Coming to you live.

1360
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:31,914
I expected to find a large force here

1361
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:34,229
But a search has uncovered

1362
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:36,032
only these two officers.

1363
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,596
Gentlemen, can you tell us...

1364
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:40,909
...why you are the only ones here?

1365
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:42,229
Well, it was because

1366
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,117
... yesterday our Chief had a special...

1367
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,357
Sorry, it's classified

1368
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:50,112
for student Liu's safety.

1369
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,033
Again, gentleman...

1370
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:54,837
...have you found any clues here?

1371
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:56,912
Not just yet.

1372
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:58,069
But I'm sure that

1373
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,911
LlU is here in Dongshi Township.

1374
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:01,912
I may be fresh out of Police Academy,

1375
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,036
but I've always had good hunches.

1376
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,349
And my senior here is a sure shot.

1377
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:06,872
I'm sure we'll nail the villains.

1378
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:10,995
We'll risk our lives for Liu

1379
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,319
if necessary.

1380
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,230
Turning to Mr. Sure Shot...

1381
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:16,918
Do you have an opinion about this?

1382
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:20,997
We just follow orders.

1383
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:26,597
Thanks for sharing that with us.

1384
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:30,352
Hello?

1385
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:35,910
A-ching, what the hell?

1386
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:39,238
How come nobody answers?

1387
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:42,955
The Exam is just hours away...

1388
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,359
This is just...

1389
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:46,318
Here, not over there!

1390
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:47,753
Enough over there!

1391
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,318
Stop shouting at me!

1392
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,675
A-hsien, try once more.

1393
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:53,671
We must get through.

1394
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:54,715
Again!

1395
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:55,835
Yes!

1396
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:01,428
You're useless!

1397
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,913
Get a move on!

1398
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,719
You walk like you're at sea.

1399
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:11,839
Well?

1400
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,877
Only a few hours left.

1401
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:16,317
The walkie-talkie is dead.

1402
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:18,879
Wonder if they've made contact

1403
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:19,869
with his family?

1404
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:21,074
What shall we do?

1405
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:25,919
It's three now,

1406
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,313
Iet's wait till four.

1407
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:29,833
If we still haven't heard...

1408
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,910
We'll take him to the Exam,

1409
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,069
and forget about the money.

1410
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:34,879
And forget about the money?

1411
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,313
Then what about your family?

1412
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:37,992
Have you thought about them?

1413
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,033
Forget about the money!

1414
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:48,514
Forget about the money?!

1415
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:50,112
Then what the hell am I doing here?

1416
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:01,556
Ma, it's almost four. Let's give up.

1417
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,952
Ma, we can't play with his future!

1418
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:19,030
A-hsiung!

1419
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:20,758
I'm trying to take a leak!

1420
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:21,909
What time is it?

1421
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:23,717
It's too late, let's go back.

1422
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:26,314
You really want to give up?

1423
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,629
Can't start this thing.

1424
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,238
Great piece of junk you borrowed!

1425
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:40,116
Now what?

1426
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:42,069
How do we get back?

1427
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:43,513
Let me think.

1428
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,232
Sure, take your time.

1429
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,068
What now?

1430
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:01,237
What?

1431
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:03,237
Get over here!

1432
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:04,909
What's up?

1433
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:06,069
Cops!

1434
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,991
Chih-chiang, Tao-nan...

1435
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:16,399
Put on these life-vests.

1436
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:22,319
What now?

1437
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:23,639
It'll be quicker to swim.

1438
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,114
Swim?

1439
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:27,749
Ma!

1440
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:29,910
Ma, let's give up!

1441
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:31,439
Okay...

1442
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:35,753
... go fetch them.

1443
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:37,593
Okay, hurry up.

1444
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:38,999
It's almost four. Quick.

1445
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:43,109
Fair? I ranked first in High School.

1446
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:45,793
but I didn't pass my first Entrance Exam.

1447
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:47,119
What's fair about it?

1448
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:48,269
You call it fair?

1449
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,118
You should have studied more!

1450
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:51,872
What the hell do you know?

1451
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:53,115
What was your mark?

1452
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,519
From which school?

1453
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:55,191
Okay. Okay.

1454
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:57,397
Let's not get over-excited now.

1455
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:58,990
Ladies and gentlemen,

1456
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,719
we'll be right back to discuss

1457
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:04,871
"Kidnap and the Entrance Exam"

1458
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:09,640
Juan, we're going to fetch Chih-chiang.

1459
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:11,756
We're sending him back to Taipei.

1460
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:14,593
Hurry, they may be ashore by now.

1461
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:54,830
How in heaven will we find them?

1462
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:56,912
Maybe A-ching is bringing them back.

1463
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:58,558
Let's wait for them.

1464
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:00,319
How could he be?

1465
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:02,033
He might be.

1466
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:03,837
Hey, cops!

1467
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:08,912
A-ching, no need to hurry.

1468
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:10,797
I don't want to sit the Exam.

1469
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:12,713
Say no more.

1470
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:15,714
No matter what, you gotta do it!

1471
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:19,240
Shit, how did I get into this?

1472
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,718
The Board should award

1473
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:26,915
Liu a special bonus mark.

1474
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,238
Eighteen!

1475
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:35,071
Ten!

1476
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:37,230
I'll give you another chance.

1477
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:38,992
Stop thumping me, will ya?

1478
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,228
Again!

1479
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:45,228
Where the hell are they?

1480
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,515
A-ching, I have to take a rest.

1481
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:57,115
Keep going, we're almost there.

1482
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:59,709
But I've got cramp!

1483
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:06,748
Hang in there, Liu Chih-chiang!

1484
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:11,790
A-ching, go on without me!

1485
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:13,599
What are you saying?

1486
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:16,119
Come on, I'll push you.

1487
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:21,198
Look, a boat! Help!

1488
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:26,590
God save you, Liu Chih-chiang!

1489
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:29,356
Eighteen!

1490
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:32,229
Two hundred sausages!

1491
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:34,675
Junior, tell you what?

1492
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:35,908
I have a hunch...

1493
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:38,070
... we're about to nab Old Hui.

1494
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:39,274
I feel a vacation coming on.

1495
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:41,316
Hey boss, do me a favor.

1496
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:43,117
Heat 40 of them for me.

1497
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:43,791
40! -Okay...

1498
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:44,869
Junior, take 40.

1499
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:47,235
Give them to everyone in sight.

1500
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:47,956
My treat!

1501
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:49,075
Okay.

1502
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:52,952
Shouldn't we see the boat by now?

1503
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:53,790
Maybe something's happened?

1504
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,518
Cut the crap!

1505
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:57,910
Hello, everyone.

1506
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:00,514
My senior won 200 sausages.

1507
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:01,995
Help yourselves, on us!

1508
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,194
Come on, everyone.

1509
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:04,196
Thank you.

1510
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:05,758
Thanks a lot.

1511
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,833
Waiting for someone?

1512
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,231
Yes, for my husband!

1513
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:11,999
"A sailor boy for me"?

1514
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:13,559
I've heard that one.

1515
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,073
Help yourselves, there's plenty.

1516
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:16,308
Okay...

1517
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:20,312
Asshole!

1518
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,398
Look, there's a boat!

1519
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:33,392
Looks like Hsiung.

1520
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:35,279
A-hsiung!

1521
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:41,392
Ten!

1522
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:44,275
I quit!

1523
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:46,352
400 sausages!

1524
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:48,157
You owe me 400 sausages, buddy.

1525
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,399
Senior, look, a boat!

1526
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:51,389
Shall we treat them too?

1527
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,909
Sure, it's all on me.

1528
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:55,035
All on me.

1529
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,234
Come on, quick.

1530
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:57,036
Coming up!

1531
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:59,914
A-hsiung, what's wrong with you?

1532
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:01,148
I'm dying.

1533
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:03,196
A-hsiung, don't die on me!

1534
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,231
He just has cramp, Auntie!

1535
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:06,389
He won't die.

1536
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:08,038
Thank you, we owe you for this.

1537
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:10,190
Quick, there's a cop coming.

1538
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,993
Here, sausages for everyone!

1539
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:20,913
One for you, kid.

1540
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:30,551
Don't move!

1541
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:33,199
Sir! Sir!

1542
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:36,070
What?

1543
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:37,750
Liu Chih-chiang!

1544
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:38,556
Uh?

1545
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,514
On your knees, all of you.

1546
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:43,109
Call the Chief, right now!

1547
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:44,189
Quick!

1548
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:47,878
You two, stand up!

1549
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:50,031
Liu Chih-chiang?

1550
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:52,878
Wang Tao-nan?

1551
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:54,992
Did these two kidnap you?

1552
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:08,718
No! They rescued us.

1553
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:11,753
So where are the kidnappers?

1554
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:15,631
They stole a boat from these guys...

1555
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,197
... threw us in the water and got away.

1556
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:20,714
These men kept us afloat

1557
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:25,518
until we were picked up by this boat.

1558
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:30,594
Is any of you Old Hui?

1559
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:31,955
No! No!

1560
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:32,790
I'm A-ching.

1561
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:33,950
I'm A-hsiung.

1562
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:36,318
He's my husband.

1563
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,519
Sir! Sir!

1564
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:40,192
Chief says to send them back to Taipei.

1565
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:41,633
So he can sit the Exam.

1566
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:42,993
They're sending back-up now.

1567
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:43,671
Good.

1568
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:44,908
These aren't the villains.

1569
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:45,716
Help them up.

1570
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:46,436
Sorry about that.

1571
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:47,759
Please get up.

1572
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:48,988
You helped us crack the case.

1573
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,228
Our back-up is on the way.

1574
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,195
Please wait for them.

1575
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:53,077
Liu Chih-chiang, come with us.

1576
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:54,752
You wait a while, please.

1577
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:56,558
I have 400-odd sausages there...

1578
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:58,630
Help yourselves!

1579
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,150
Chih-chiang!

1580
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:05,309
Go!

1581
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:07,390
Do it! Pass the Exam!

1582
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:09,318
You can do it!

1583
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:12,073
Bye bye!

1584
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:14,718
Do well! We're with you!

1585
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:16,233
Do well!

1586
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,599
Bye!

1587
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:30,269
Still busy!

1588
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:31,110
Weird...

1589
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:34,113
Let me try for you. What's the number?

1590
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:35,633
767-8804.

1591
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:36,834
In Taipei?

1592
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,115
02-767...

1593
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:41,155
What's that "02"?

1594
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:42,957
Area code.

1595
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:44,757
Oh, right!

1596
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:50,918
Thank you!

1597
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:52,758
They've found him!

1598
01:39:53,280 --> 01:40:00,550
Get his things ready for the Exam.

1599
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,994
No time to lose.

1600
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:08,078
What else? Quick!

1601
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:23,072
Here, I'll help you.

1602
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:36,030
What's this?

1603
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:38,236
For Liu Chih-chiang, from A-chuan.

1604
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:38,956
What's it?

1605
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:39,870
I don't know.

1606
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:41,909
Okay, anything else?

1607
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:43,512
Move out of my way!

1608
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:47,959
Liu Chih-chiang, this is from A-chuan.

1609
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,033
A-chuan!

1610
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:17,632
Chih-chiang, you said

1611
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:20,275
you saw tropical fish in the sea.

1612
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:24,154
I used to be a bit like you.

1613
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:27,957
Thinking there were tropical fish here.

1614
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:32,755
Later I found out...

1615
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:35,232
... there aren't any in the sea here.

1616
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:39,148
But last time we got flooded...

1617
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:44,029
... I found this tropical fish...

1618
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:46,837
... Ieft behind in a ditch.

1619
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,834
I've no idea how it got here.

1620
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:53,956
I want you to have it.

1621
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:55,678
I hope you like it.

1622
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:58,953
Although we never

1623
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:00,279
talked to each other...

1624
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:03,918
... I know you're a dreamer.

1625
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:07,038
I envy you.

1626
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:10,754
You can study.

1627
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:12,557
Even sit the Exam.

1628
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:16,190
But I can't.

1629
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:20,873
A year ago,

1630
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,157
my brother took me out of school

1631
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:26,190
and sent me to work in Kaohsiung.

1632
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:32,553
I fell in love with a guy there.

1633
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:36,350
To my horror...

1634
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:40,310
... he and his friend raped me.

1635
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:45,434
I used to be a dreamer too.

1636
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:47,437
But now...

1637
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:50,398
I have no dreams left.

1638
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:55,794
We have to walk through life,

1639
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:58,234
not dream it.

1640
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:02,159
Make the best of what you have.

1641
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:08,199
Stick to the road you choose!

1642
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:11,715
Good luck with the Exam!

1643
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:33,749
We're at the Taichung exit

1644
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:35,079
from the highway.

1645
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:36,559
Liu Chih-chiang's police escort

1646
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:37,276
is due any moment.

1647
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:38,872
Huge crowds are here

1648
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:39,790
to catch a glimpse of him.

1649
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:46,673
Liu Chih-chiang! Go!

1650
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:48,593
This is a touching scene.

1651
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:49,749
Now we hand you back to

1652
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:52,274
Chen Shih-chieh in Taipei.

1653
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:54,271
Since the two brave policemen

1654
01:43:54,280 --> 01:43:54,951
rescued him...

1655
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:56,916
... kind people have rushed

1656
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:58,512
to help Liu Chih-chiang.

1657
01:43:58,680 --> 01:44:03,117
Offering books and test papers...

1658
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:04,314
... to welcome him back

1659
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:09,355
Liu Chih-chiang! Go for it!

1660
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:20,071
The Exam results are out, and so...

1661
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:21,519
... we'll end our story

1662
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:24,159
of King Saloman today.

1663
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:26,396
Now here's a letter

1664
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,149
from Wang Tao-nan

1665
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:31,755
of Puguang Orphanage in Taipei.

1666
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:35,078
He's written it phonetically.

1667
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:36,832
He's probably very young.

1668
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:40,353
He says, there's a kind of fish...

1669
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:42,794
... Iiving at the bottom of the sea...

1670
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,791
... which feeds on children's dreams.

1671
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:49,352
When it's eaten 9,999 dreams...

1672
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,955
... it will fly

1673
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:55,157
out from the sea on wings.

1674
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:56,915
Wang Tao-nan says

1675
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:58,751
he saw it a month ago.

1676
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:03,272
A gigantic fish flying up

1677
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:05,840
from the bottom of the sea.
