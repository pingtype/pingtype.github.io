1
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,112
Look up.

2
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,388
Some people stop producing enough tears

3
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,358
when they pass thirty.

4
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,234
Tears are produced

5
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,436
for two reasons.

6
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,395
Firstly,

7
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,995
the eyes need moistening.

8
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,195
Secondly,

9
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,236
when you get emotional

10
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,151
Iike crying

11
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,912
or you're moved by something.

12
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,996
Good.

13
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,275
Is it serious?

14
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,196
No.

15
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,838
I'll prescribe some eye drops.

16
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,118
Take them and come back

17
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,395
for another check

18
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,356
next Monday afternoon, OK?

19
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,352
I put a personal ad in the newspaper.

20
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,670
I know it's hard to believe.

21
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,518
Call it a momentary slip then.

22
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,318
Besides, who knows?

23
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,709
Maybe I'll find happiness.

24
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,996
I've got over a hundred calls

25
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,878
in three days.

26
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,869
Some of them asked

27
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,393
to see my picture.

28
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,389
I said to them,

29
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,790
I didn't ask to see theirs so

30
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,390
they shouldn't ask to see mine either.

31
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,753
It's fair.

32
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,911
I don't tell them I'm a doctor either.

33
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,152
Anyway, I've already quit my job.

34
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,597
What made you decide to put up

35
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,434
a personal ad to look for a husband?

36
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,236
I couldn't think of anything better.

37
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,832
Then I thought...

38
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,519
But you're not...

39
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,193
... you're not bad looking.

40
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,398
You must be very popular.

41
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,879
You didn't find anyone

42
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,712
suitable?

43
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,871
I don't want someone

44
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,598
from my circle.

45
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,158
And I feel that

46
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,717
I can't be on my own for now.

47
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,593
What did you say?

48
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,596
I can't be on my own.

49
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,358
You can't be on your own?

50
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,188
You mentioned your circle...

51
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,589
What do you do?

52
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,154
I've just quit.

53
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,673
I used to work in a hospital.

54
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,711
You worked in a hospital?

55
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,911
Why did you quit?

56
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,113
I wanted some changes in my life.

57
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,196
Changes?

58
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,918
Have you had boyfriends?

59
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,270
Yes.

60
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,594
How many?

61
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:29,991
Four.

62
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,076
Four...

63
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,114
How long was the longest relationship?

64
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,429
How long?

65
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,237
Over three years.

66
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,639
The shortest?

67
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,033
Over a year.

68
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,916
Over a year?

69
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,076
Could I ask something

70
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,796
more personal?

71
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,239
It depends.

72
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,714
Hello.

73
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,315
Nice to meet you.

74
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,436
Nice to meet you, too.

75
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,872
My name's Wang. Wang Chao-ming.

76
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,797
Yes, I know.

77
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,031
My friends call me Wang Chao.

78
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,868
Because Wang Chao means

79
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,074
the "Royal Soldier".

80
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,911
So they call me Wang Chao.

81
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,435
Do you get it?

82
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,390
Do you mind me chewing betel nut?

83
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,636
I wouldn't say I would but...

84
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,876
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,916
I smoke as well.

86
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,200
You have to keep chewing.

87
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,394
You can't stop, can you?

88
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,799
No, no.

89
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,199
I can stop.

90
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,309
If you don't like it, I can stop.

91
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,552
I'll just spit it out.

92
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,635
Is it OK?

93
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,677
It's OK. You keep chewing.

94
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,877
In that case...

95
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,119
So, Mr. Wang,

96
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,432
you say that

97
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,509
you work in a PC factory?

98
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,554
Yes, it's an industrial job.

99
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,676
I cut PC boards.

100
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,798
One after another.

101
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,231
Each sheets is cut down the line.

102
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,637
Mr. Wang, I wonder...

103
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,516
...how much do you make from your work?

104
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,509
My pay?

105
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,351
Around NT$30,000

106
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,351
per month.

107
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,354
It's not a lot.

108
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,677
But it's enough to survive.

109
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,193
Enough to keep a roof over my head.

110
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,315
Definitely enough!

111
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,438
But is it enough to support a wife?

112
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,953
Of course it is.

113
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,838
I can work extra time.

114
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,872
For my wife...

115
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,073
I'd work extra time. I would!

116
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,997
But...

117
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,433
you can't do it every day.

118
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,793
You can't cope with it...

119
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,870
And you'll have no time for your wife.

120
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,876
Yes, I will.

121
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,518
Because I won't work

122
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,748
until very late.

123
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,875
I won't, right?

124
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,435
Three hours extra

125
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,715
at most.

126
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,276
You said you've had many blind dates?

127
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,910
Yes, so many blind dates.

128
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,636
But none of them was successful.

129
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,275
Is that...?

130
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,793
Do you understand?

131
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,314
Not successful, right? But...

132
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,833
Failures, I would say...

133
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,597
What?

134
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,353
Nothing, you just spat on my face.

135
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,236
Really?

136
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,509
It's OK.

137
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,033
I'm so sorry.

138
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,112
I've had a lot of girlfriends,

139
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,552
right?

140
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,118
That way I'd have

141
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,588
a lot of choices.

142
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,989
Right?

143
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,355
That's not to say

144
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,918
I'm a...

145
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,638
... playboy.

146
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,516
No, not at all.

147
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,431
It just means

148
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,555
I'd have more choices.

149
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,551
But my wife

150
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,551
will be the love of my life.

151
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,357
You didn't find anyone suitable

152
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,634
amongst them?

153
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,868
No.

154
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,437
Why not?

155
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,112
No one was suitable.

156
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,709
Personality clash.

157
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,109
With all of them?

158
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,749
Or do you have some specific...

159
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,637
... ideal in mind?

160
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,433
So it's hard to find the right one.

161
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,111
The main thing is

162
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,510
some women...

163
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,439
are rather materialistic.

164
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,510
They really are!

165
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,353
You know what I mean?

166
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,235
When I take them out,

167
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,593
they want to go to

168
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,238
expensive restaurants.

169
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,630
Every day. Every meal.

170
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,190
I think what they love

171
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,509
isn't me, the husband,

172
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,795
but material luxuries!

173
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,511
Well... I see them as failures

174
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,150
and interesting experiences.

175
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,352
Mr. Wang, if...

176
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,910
If your wife...

177
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,353
Yes, my wife...

178
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,871
ask you to quit betel nut and smoking...

179
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,439
Do you drink?

180
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,158
No, I don't.

181
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,516
Would you quit?

182
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,430
Yes, I would.

183
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,716
Can you?

184
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,436
Yes, I can.

185
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,715
I'm not that addicted to

186
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,835
betel nut or smoking.

187
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,750
I'll be fine.

188
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,076
Miss, if you say...

189
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,793
If it's OK...

190
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,234
I wonder if you would...

191
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,433
... marry me?

192
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,113
Marry me, please.

193
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,348
That's too fast

194
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,395
Too fast?

195
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,438
Could you...

196
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,989
It's all right...we can be...

197
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,229
But I mean...

198
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,958
If you marry me then I can quit!

199
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,238
It's a deal!

200
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,278
How about it?

201
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,318
I promise.

202
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,431
Please think about it.

203
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,509
If it's OK with you.

204
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,956
You don't have to answer me right away.

205
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,829
So...

206
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,152
Let's drink a toast!

207
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,593
Hello.

208
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,553
Are you...

209
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,190
...the girl on the phone?

210
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,552
My name's Tao.

211
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,159
Mr. Tao.

212
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,990
Yes.

213
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,151
You have quite a history!

214
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,750
Sure. Since I graduated from high school,

215
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,432
I went on to Japan to study.

216
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,118
First at Osaka University

217
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,431
to become a...

218
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,158
manufacturing designer.

219
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,435
Then at Tokyo University,

220
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,317
I studied psychology and physiology.

221
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,073
Then two years of research in Shizuoka.

222
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,672
I came back to Taiwan.

223
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,077
As I worked in the international trade,

224
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,915
I traveled around the world.

225
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,559
I've been to America, Europe,

226
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,152
Japan and other Asian countries.

227
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,037
Later I went to mainland China

228
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,912
when they allowed

229
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,798
visits across the strait.

230
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,031
So I went to China,

231
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,598
and then...

232
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,874
After returning to Taiwan,

233
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,632
I did a lot of charity work.

234
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,511
For example,

235
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,080
I worked for a Buddhist charity.

236
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,071
We help our brothers and sisters

237
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,437
in Taiwan.

238
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,389
They are people who are in need.

239
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,630
I'm involved in good works.

240
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,438
Another job I must tell you about is

241
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,393
I teach singing

242
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,628
in a senior's home.

243
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,789
You teach singing?

244
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,835
Yes.

245
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,716
May I sing a song for you?

246
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,596
OK?

247
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,875
It's a nice song.

248
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,791
The song of "Everlasting Youth".

249
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,590
"We say life begins at the age of seventy. "

250
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,388
"Eighty's not rare. "

251
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,990
"Ninety is a dime a dozen."

252
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,719
"One hundred is the season of smiles. "

253
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,717
That's what I do.

254
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,109
It makes the old folks happy.

255
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,509
It cheers them up.

256
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,638
So...

257
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,550
May I ask...

258
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,279
...how old are you?

259
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,998
I'm in my thirties.

260
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,189
Miss Wu,

261
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,913
what else should l

262
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,195
tell you about me?

263
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,910
You have nothing to ask me?

264
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,434
I've been doing all the asking.

265
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,119
It's your turn to ask.

266
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,953
I have no questions for you.

267
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,074
Excuse me, are you Miss Wu?

268
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,349
Mr. Lin.

269
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,029
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

270
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,759
This is my name card.

271
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,037
You're a Scorpio.

272
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,871
Scorpio!

273
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,599
Scorpios tend to be proud and aloof.

274
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,079
People say that

275
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,354
but I don't agree.

276
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,550
I still don't know

277
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,073
what you do.

278
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,238
I work in a hospital.

279
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:18,832
In a hospital!

280
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,392
Yes.

281
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,588
Are you a doctor?

282
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,790
No,

283
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,792
I'm a pharmacist.

284
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,558
I think your shoes are very special.

285
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,834
They're very pretty

286
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,159
and make you look innocent.

287
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,149
They're okay.

288
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,875
Do you mind if I smoke?

289
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,318
Well...

290
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,550
Aren't you curious about me?

291
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,798
Sorry about the smoke.

292
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,917
You...

293
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,111
I think your shoes are really

294
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,115
really special.

295
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,271
You're really into shoes.

296
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,030
Yes.

297
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,951
Do you mind if we play a game?

298
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,237
A psychological test

299
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,390
about shoes.

300
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,029
All right.

301
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,956
This suitcase...

302
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,636
It's full of women's shoes.

303
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:16,996
Yeah, women's shoes.

304
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,035
You brought it with you?

305
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,155
Yes.

306
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,355
Do you want to play the game?

307
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,110
How?

308
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,838
I put a shoe on you

309
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,074
and see how you respond to it.

310
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,670
I don't think it's a good idea.

311
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,749
It's OK.

312
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,677
Let's give it a try.

313
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,873
You can't judge a person

314
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,949
based on his reaction to a shoe!

315
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,836
I bought this one in Paris.

316
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,273
If it doesn't fit,

317
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,156
would you think

318
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,195
there is something with me?

319
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,076
No, I wouldn't.

320
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,433
Let's give it a try.

321
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,429
It's fun, right?

322
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,670
Try it! I bought it in Paris.

323
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,593
We'll attract attentions.

324
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,353
They can't see us in here.

325
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,110
Besides,

326
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,519
no one will see me under the table!

327
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,635
Come on, try it!

328
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,556
Wow! It looks so special on you!

329
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,758
Want to try another pair?

330
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,398
Come on, try another one.

331
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,788
Miss Wu...

332
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,396
It's eleven thirty in the evening.

333
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,993
Thursday night.

334
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,114
It's time for me to call you again.

335
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,437
I'm fine.

336
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,794
Anything you'd like to tell me about?

337
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,188
Professor Lo.

338
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,032
Are you looking for furniture?

339
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,352
Well, my wife wants to look around.

340
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,751
And the kids want to go to McDonald's.

341
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,872
I'm tagging along.

342
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,271
How are you doing?

343
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,635
Why are you still single?

344
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,553
I haven't met Mr. Right.

345
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,754
Nobody wants me.

346
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,354
That can't be true! You're too choosy.

347
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,636
No, I think I just haven't met Mr. Right.

348
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,672
Some seem okay.

349
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,070
But when it comes to marriage...

350
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,071
... it doesn't feel right.

351
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,991
It's really hard.

352
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,036
You haven't met anyone suitable?

353
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,798
The good ones are all taken.

354
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,310
That can't be true.

355
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,911
You should broaden your frequency range.

356
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,668
Broaden your frequency range.

357
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,075
What do you mean?

358
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,674
If you set a very narrow range,

359
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,717
Iike when you tune a radio...

360
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,836
Hello? May I ask...

361
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,031
May I ask...

362
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,793
What do you do?

363
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,229
Is she the one?

364
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,196
Looks like it.

365
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,714
That's her, right?

366
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,428
Have you brought anything

367
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,795
that proves you're 28 years old?

368
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,434
No.

369
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,837
No?

370
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,637
Well...

371
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,195
How old are you?

372
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,995
I'll give you one last chance.

373
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,672
How old are you?

374
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,753
All right.

375
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,668
I'm seventeen.

376
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,433
Seventeen years old?

377
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,919
I can't believe he told her!

378
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,429
Sometimes I'd get dead drunk.

379
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,358
Once...actually several times...

380
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,952
I ended up sleeping in the street.

381
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,393
But usually I'd remember that

382
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,038
I have to go to work the next day,

383
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,870
and it keeps me

384
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,348
from drinking too much.

385
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,518
In addition to drinking,

386
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,398
you must have other hobbies?

387
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,310
Well...

388
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,237
Apart from drinking,

389
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,358
I like watching adult movies.

390
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,389
You know what? It's really fun.

391
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,795
Once I came across an old movie

392
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,552
starring Ai lijima.

393
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,876
It was really interesting.

394
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,996
She was still very young.

395
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,231
She looked so tanned.

396
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,673
There is a beach scene.

397
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,796
She is strolling with her boyfriend

398
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,794
on the beach.

399
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,994
They are walking along.

400
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,991
Suddenly three guys turn up

401
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,917
and they take hold of her!

402
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,638
It was a very powerful scene!

403
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,269
It made me so excited.

404
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,309
There are other kinds-like S&M.

405
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,873
S&M means sadomasochism.

406
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,839
The sadist is the attacker

407
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,195
while the masochist is the victim.

408
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,999
There are different genres.

409
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,072
They are shot in different ways.

410
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,192
Each kind gives me

411
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,914
a different sensation.

412
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,434
Actually, if it's possible,

413
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,555
I wouldn't mind

414
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,994
making one myself.

415
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,432
Can you understand?

416
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,710
Do you believe that I can tell fortunes?

417
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,270
Can you?

418
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,110
Yes, I can.

419
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,236
Give me your right hand.

420
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,036
Right hand.

421
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,316
I see that the time's not right

422
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,351
for you to marry.

423
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,271
You have many things

424
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,430
to enjoy first.

425
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,391
Look at this.

426
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,914
What it tells is...

427
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,911
...in your previous life,

428
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,831
your marriage was too perfect.

429
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,956
So in this life,

430
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,836
marriage isn't right for you.

431
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,719
But in our society

432
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,638
the pressure is always on

433
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,039
getting married.

434
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,600
You shouldn't give in to it.

435
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,315
When should I get married then?

436
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,717
I think marriage...

437
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,033
Marriage is just a formality.

438
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,316
What I have in mind is very simple.

439
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:51,718
We met each other

440
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,075
under such circumstances.

441
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,839
I'm sincere

442
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,909
and I believe you are, too.

443
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,592
Or you wouldn't have placed the ad.

444
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,875
So how do we advance to

445
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,599
the next step?

446
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,798
This is what I want to say.

447
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,558
No need for

448
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,913
unnecessary formalities.

449
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,915
My idea is simple, direct,

450
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,992
and sincere.

451
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,796
I believe that

452
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,994
you can see it in my eyes.

453
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,558
Although...

454
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:26,270
we met under such circumstances...

455
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,953
you really impress me.

456
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,191
But how can you...

457
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,879
Can you rely on

458
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,756
your first impression

459
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,877
to know whom to marry?

460
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,830
Whom to marry?

461
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,670
I....

462
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,752
Yes, I am looking for a husband.

463
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,710
Actually...

464
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,394
I...

465
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,709
What I've been trying to say is...

466
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,276
Actually, we don't...

467
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,871
We don't have to bother

468
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,519
with such formalities.

469
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,676
You know what I mean?

470
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,511
You and l,

471
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,914
we know each other, right?

472
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,391
You're a woman and I'm a man,

473
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,197
we can...

474
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,636
Do you get it now?

475
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,433
I don't know what you're talking about.

476
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,109
What I mean is...

477
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,439
to be honest with you...

478
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,351
Today I came here,

479
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,429
I want to meet a girl.

480
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,396
You've left me

481
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,910
with a really good impression.

482
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,718
I really...

483
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,389
I might as well say it.

484
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,789
My purpose is....

485
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,193
I want to make love to you.

486
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,599
You know what I mean?

487
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,159
Make love!

488
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,919
I think

489
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,195
it's only natural.

490
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,237
Here we are.

491
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,993
We should give it a try.

492
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,679
In our society...

493
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,432
But I feel nothing for you.

494
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,514
Between men and women...

495
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,714
the feelings will come

496
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,914
once we have done it.

497
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,433
Don't you think that's a bit too easy?

498
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,714
You pick a girl off the street.

499
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,914
You think she's nice

500
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,956
and then you want to sleep with her.

501
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,872
But I have my principles.

502
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,393
I have my principles

503
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,197
about whom I sleep with.

504
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,031
She has to be good enough for you.

505
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,070
Well, that's it.

506
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,990
Because...

507
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,911
Why don't you just get a prostitute?

508
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,749
I hate the idea.

509
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,433
Because when you're through with her...

510
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,113
you have to pay her and that feels bad!

511
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,311
So you want a free prostitute?

512
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,158
No, not really.

513
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,913
I've waited several days

514
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,558
to meet you...

515
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,552
Like waiting for your prey.

516
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,519
You shouldn't put it like that.

517
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,715
Look, let me be frank with you.

518
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,153
I'm thirty-five, married,

519
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,990
with a child.

520
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,353
So what? No big deal!

521
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,271
I'm still out there

522
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,192
Iooking for what I want.

523
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,396
Marriage certificate is

524
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,594
just a piece of paper.

525
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,355
You can't take it seriously, can you?

526
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,635
Maybe you're right.

527
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,269
But...

528
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,437
I'm talking from my experiences.

529
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,919
Look at the news.

530
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,114
Stories about unhappy marriages every day.

531
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,430
I think we should stop this discussion.

532
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,555
You don't have to...

533
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,755
All I can tell you is that

534
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,193
I am really sincere.

535
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,236
Very sincere in my offer!

536
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,436
I think this is a...

537
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,670
very romantic place.

538
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,669
But we can find

539
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,874
an even more romantic place.

540
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,393
Check, please!

541
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,355
Check.

542
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,709
Come on...

543
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,149
Miss, the Check!

544
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,151
I want you to see how sincere I am.

545
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,674
You check!

546
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,352
The taxes you pay

547
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,952
control our lives.

548
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,030
And the politicians control the taxes.

549
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,195
I want to ask.

550
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,714
I want to know your real motives.

551
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,119
Let me introduce myself...

552
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,509
I'm the president of the Hsin Mei Corporation.

553
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,439
Quite rich!

554
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,155
Yes, there are many opportunities.

555
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,309
Actually l...

556
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,880
Yes, I haven't done much

557
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,195
but...

558
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,990
Today I went to meet the men

559
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,956
as I planned.

560
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,199
Every day I take the same bus

561
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,958
to the same teahouse.

562
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,029
It feels like going to work.

563
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,231
Back then

564
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,998
I treated my patients.

565
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,112
But for these men...

566
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,111
No matter how sincere they are,

567
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,311
there is nothing I can do for them.

568
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,671
Each time I see them,

569
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,270
I think of you.

570
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,992
I don't mind you not answering the phone.

571
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,117
Just let me talk.

572
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,873
As I did before.

573
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,312
Tell you what happened

574
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,515
in my life.

575
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,799
You might think I'm crazy.

576
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,677
Talking to your answering machine

577
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,636
Iike a mad woman.

578
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,036
But if I don't...

579
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,916
I think

580
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,354
I really will go nuts.

581
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,396
I'm advertising for a husband.

582
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,755
Advertising?

583
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,394
Wow!

584
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,791
See how determined I am?

585
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,230
Any results?

586
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,195
Haven't found the right one yet.

587
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,759
Not yet.

588
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,031
I think it's my problem.

589
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,838
It's not that they're not good enough.

590
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,115
I haven't opened up myself yet.

591
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,196
But I'll try.

592
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,078
Is that relationship really over?

593
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,077
You and your ex...

594
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,874
Can I ask you something more personal?

595
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,875
Hello?

596
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,550
Can I ask you something more personal?

597
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,999
It depends.

598
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,273
Did you sleep

599
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,430
with all your boyfriends?

600
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,439
Did you sleep

601
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,193
with all your boyfriends?

602
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,553
Well...

603
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,597
It's my turn to ask.

604
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,638
Go ahead.

605
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,111
But I haven't finished with mine.

606
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,836
So?

607
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,678
All right, I'll put it another way.

608
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,433
Do you do one night stands?

609
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,709
No.

610
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,798
You think that's...

611
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,150
Chia-wen! Over here!

612
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,633
Sit down.

613
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,035
This is Miss Wu.

614
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,595
She's my assistant.

615
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,832
Sort of secretary.

616
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,953
One of my secretaries.

617
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,870
Is it taken care off?

618
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:31,916
How is it going?

619
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,433
Yes.

620
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,035
Just a minute.

621
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,195
Hello.

622
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,598
Yes, I'll ask her to come over.

623
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,670
You talk to her then.

624
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,199
Here.

625
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,630
You don't do one night stands.

626
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,230
What business are you in?

627
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,792
You said you would tell me when we met.

628
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,550
I think...

629
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,069
I'm a freelancer.

630
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,831
What kind of freelancer?

631
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,791
What kind of freelancer...

632
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,878
If I told you,

633
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,069
you could earn a lot of money...

634
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,959
Would you do it?

635
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,150
What kind of work do you do?

636
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,438
To be blunt, it's...

637
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,951
in the line of the high-class...

638
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,431
sex industry.

639
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,877
If I told you...

640
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,879
Excuse me.

641
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,879
You're not into it?

642
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,396
Have you ever considered it?

643
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,433
This is ridiculous!

644
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,396
My ad is very clear!

645
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,436
I'm... Iooking for

646
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,835
a husband!

647
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,796
I am looking for a... right!

648
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,239
But I just...

649
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,310
Why do you doubt what it says in the ad?

650
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,799
I don't. No.

651
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,189
No? What are you here for?

652
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,872
I want to get married, too!

653
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,233
Of course I do.

654
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:24,752
I want to get married!

655
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,829
But if you need money...

656
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,314
I can help you with that.

657
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,152
That's impossible for me!

658
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,078
That's impossible!

659
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,629
Listen, I've met lots of people

660
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,434
especially women...

661
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,156
Nothing is impossible!

662
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,868
If you can think differently,

663
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,233
everything is possible!

664
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,789
But never mind.

665
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,951
Here's my card.

666
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,157
If you change your mind...

667
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,951
give me a call.

668
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,678
Bye.

669
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,753
Mr. Chou,

670
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,511
can I ask you a few questions?

671
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,673
Go ahead.

672
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,998
What made you think...

673
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,595
because I put up an ad...

674
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,550
you have the rights

675
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,278
to ask me these questions?

676
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,636
I don't know how to answer that.

677
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,032
A personal ad means

678
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,432
we can get to know each other.

679
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,557
But what on earth...

680
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,272
You know nothing about me.

681
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,669
Nothing about my background,

682
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,669
my past...

683
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,159
or anything else.

684
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,833
And you assume that I would...

685
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,354
Then you want...want to...

686
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,349
No, no, wait a minute!

687
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:02,917
No.

688
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,674
What is your rationale?

689
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,235
My rationale? There's none!

690
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,959
I am looking for a wife.

691
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,153
But there's no harm asking!

692
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:16,752
Just in case.

693
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,320
But the point is...

694
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,908
you ask a woman to be a prostitute.

695
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,716
Do you need to put it like that?

696
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,354
I feel...

697
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,873
But that's the business you're in.

698
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,997
What made you think...

699
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,594
I think you're prejudiced.

700
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,708
You discriminate people.

701
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,629
All professions are equal, right?

702
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,075
A prostitute...

703
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,595
as you call it...

704
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,034
OK, call her a prostitute.

705
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,076
So you look down on her?

706
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,076
Because of people like you...

707
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,593
I think it's because people like you

708
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,352
that they are looked down on.

709
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,194
My point is...

710
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,279
in your eyes any woman

711
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,669
can become a prostitute, right?

712
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,918
Do you try this with every woman?

713
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,555
No harm asking, right?

714
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,436
You behave like an animal

715
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,556
asking every woman if she'd go with you...

716
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,638
Not with me.

717
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,078
Not with me.

718
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,748
I think you're over-reacting.

719
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,793
If you don't want to do it,

720
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,719
it's not a big deal.

721
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,316
If I get a job

722
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,197
in the presidential palace,

723
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,430
I'll ask you to join me.

724
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,556
That should be good enough for you.

725
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,237
Hello, sorry I missed your call.

726
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,794
Please leave a message

727
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,599
Please pick up the phone.

728
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,399
I'm sick!

729
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,759
I feel so awful.

730
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,957
Have you gone back to your wife?

731
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,549
Please pick up the phone.

732
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,555
Please...

733
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,195
One hundred and fifty.

734
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,233
Thanks! -Thanks!

735
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,957
What troubles me most is...

736
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,910
I made up my mind to do something.

737
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,195
And it's the right thing to do.

738
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,191
It's the right thing for me.

739
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,199
But I just can't do it.

740
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,231
I can't make it.

741
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,357
I feel that I can't make it.

742
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,795
You don't get it?

743
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,718
Well...

744
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,437
For example,

745
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,112
I feel...

746
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,111
it's very painful

747
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,597
when I see him.

748
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,710
So I think

749
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,836
I should put an end to it.

750
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:21,118
But when I don't get to see him,

751
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,792
the pain is even worse.

752
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,156
It all boils down to your choice.

753
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,598
Choose what you can endure.

754
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,030
Mr. Yu, was it you who called me?

755
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,629
Yes, it was me.

756
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,153
I didn't know you'd bring your father.

757
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,637
Actually, it's him

758
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,073
who's looking for a wife.

759
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,874
Go on.

760
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,954
But you...

761
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,395
But how about your mother?

762
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,397
My mother has gone living abroad.

763
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,637
She may never come back.

764
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:43,990
Because...

765
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,275
She is a modern woman.

766
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:53,909
She prefers what life abroad can offer.

767
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,394
I'm sorry.

768
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,510
I don't quite get it.

769
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,191
I mean...

770
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,589
your mother has gone abroad, right?

771
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,670
Right.

772
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,753
She's gone, but she'll be back, right?

773
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,957
It's pretty unlikely.

774
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,836
Unlikely?

775
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,670
Yes.

776
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,630
Unlikely, but if she does come back...

777
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,279
If she does, then we'll be in trouble.

778
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,510
So...

779
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,716
You get a lot of phone calls?

780
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,518
Uh, yes.

781
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,432
People are always calling me.

782
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,833
Miss Wu, you're nearsighted?

783
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,631
Yes.

784
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,114
How serious?

785
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,517
Quite serious but they're for astigmatism.

786
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,150
Why is that?

787
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,039
Because contact lenses

788
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,678
are no good for astigmatism.

789
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,432
You wear a contact for nearsightedness

790
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,192
and glasses for astigmatism?

791
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:18,916
Right.

792
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,510
You are nearsighted, too. How serious?

793
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,192
I'm...

794
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,077
I'm astigmatic.

795
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,275
My right eye is nearsighted

796
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,315
and left eye is astigmatic.

797
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,436
It's really a pain.

798
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,514
Mr. Ho,

799
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,317
there's something weird about you.

800
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,277
Me?

801
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,430
Yes.

802
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,318
What do you mean?

803
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,550
My manners

804
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,629
or my looks?

805
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,390
It's just everything

806
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,994
about you.

807
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,274
Well, I guess

808
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,554
maybe it has to do with my profession.

809
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,516
Do you know what I do?

810
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,949
No, Sorry, I forgot.

811
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,758
But you look like a fortuneteller.

812
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,389
Really?

813
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,192
Yes.

814
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,918
A fortuneteller?

815
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,069
You know what? I'm a painter.

816
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,679
A fortuneteller...

817
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,759
I mean, you could be a painter, too...

818
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:23,273
May I order a drink?

819
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,869
Of course.

820
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,513
Excuse me.

821
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,875
A beer, please!

822
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,713
Hello, hello.

823
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,633
Sorry.

824
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,116
Mr. Ho, your leg...

825
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,590
Anything wrong with it?

826
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,911
Yes. I have a bad leg.

827
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,796
What about it?

828
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,233
When you walked over there,

829
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,593
you were limping.

830
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,716
And then you weren't.

831
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,630
When you walked back,

832
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,550
you were limping again.

833
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,031
I always walk with a limp.

834
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:05,790
No, you don't.

835
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,712
You were talking and getting excited.

836
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,518
At that point, you seemed fine.

837
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,237
Really?

838
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,070
I wasn't limping

839
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,115
when I was on the phone?

840
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,509
No, you weren't.

841
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,112
And I think

842
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,792
your beard is fake, too.

843
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,915
My beard!

844
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,915
All right! You're right.

845
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,275
My leg is fine.

846
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,875
But I thought

847
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,318
if I came as a disabled person,

848
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,396
I met you

849
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,515
and you could accept that...

850
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,636
you would be a very special girl.

851
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,517
That was what I thought.

852
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,559
But my beard is real.

853
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,238
You look very familiar to me.

854
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:49,951
Really?

855
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,075
Me... familiar?

856
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:51,751
Yes.

857
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,996
You look familiar to me, too.

858
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,877
No, I mean,

859
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:56,870
I've seen you somewhere.

860
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,359
And I recognize your voice, too.

861
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,430
I went to Ching Hsin Elementary School.

862
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,994
I went to Fu Hsin.

863
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,919
You could be a classmate of my cousin's.

864
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,638
Maybe I met you

865
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,995
when I visited my cousin!

866
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,399
OK, I've gone too far.

867
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,436
So I look familiar...

868
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,752
But you know we artists...

869
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,431
From time to time,

870
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,670
we appear on TV.

871
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,033
Maybe it's possible that...

872
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,231
You should stop lying.

873
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,119
I know I've seen you before.

874
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:30,756
I've seen you

875
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,196
in all those different roles.

876
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,155
In various performances.

877
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,196
So in my mind...

878
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,793
All right.

879
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,439
So you found me out.

880
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,636
I'm an actor.

881
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,872
Sorry, it's so hot.

882
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,195
Do I really look like a fortuneteller?

883
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,751
The hat must have given me away.

884
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,830
Do you know my name?

885
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,314
No, I haven't....

886
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,153
My surname is Niu.

887
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,156
Doze Niu!

888
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,354
Yes.

889
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,431
I've seen you in the movie, Growing Up.

890
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,270
Is that right?

891
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,874
You were a kid then.

892
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:15,949
I went...

893
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,757
Did you like it?

894
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,069
I liked it

895
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,035
but you haven't acted for awhile, right?

896
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,759
I don't think I've seen you...

897
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,753
What are you doing now?

898
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,113
I'm still acting.

899
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,951
I guess you don't watch much TV.

900
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,439
See my hand?

901
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,839
I was in a Hong Kong movie

902
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,670
with Andy Lau.

903
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,352
I hurt my hand then.

904
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,509
You know...

905
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,750
We were filming at the night market.

906
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,270
I was playing Andy's sidekick...

907
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,269
We were investigators...

908
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,599
It was really crowded.

909
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,350
The killer was about to strike,

910
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,076
I rushed to save the hero...

911
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,399
Then...whoops!

912
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,435
Mr. Niu.

913
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,511
Yes?

914
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,839
This is ridiculous.

915
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,637
What?

916
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,198
You feel bored?

917
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,030
No.

918
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,035
Of course, it's ridiculous.

919
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,951
It's a movie.

920
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,349
We have to finish shooting.

921
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,759
Besides, I felt very honored...

922
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,113
No, not your movie.

923
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,314
I mean

924
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,913
our meeting here.

925
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,592
It's ridiculous.

926
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,433
Why?

927
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,075
Because I'm looking for a husband.

928
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,998
You don't want to get married...

929
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,194
Then...

930
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:18,591
Wait a minute.

931
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,669
You're here to make fun of me.

932
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,035
No, I'm not.

933
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,632
What I want to say is...

934
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,558
I do want to settle down.

935
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,356
You know what?

936
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,679
Excuse me...

937
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,274
Hello!

938
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,275
That's right, I'm in Tianmu.

939
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,310
Your girlfriend?

940
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,312
Yes, she's a nuisance.

941
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,193
She keeps asking me what I'm doing.

942
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,395
She keeps calling me.

943
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,994
I told her I was with friends.

944
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,030
And she hung up on me.

945
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,235
Then she called again.

946
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,552
Mr. Niu, l...

947
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,790
I want a more settled life.

948
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,714
I don't think your lifestyle

949
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,793
would suit me.

950
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,153
Your life is too complicated.

951
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,195
It's OK. I just...

952
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,633
Hang on...

953
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,232
People say our lives are complicated...

954
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,993
But in fact...

955
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,672
Your girlfriend's waiting for you.

956
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,353
That's all right.

957
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,272
I can leave you my number.

958
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,713
I've got your number.

959
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,273
Oh, right.

960
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,188
Where do I pay?

961
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,030
Let me.

962
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,598
No, I'll do it.

963
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,280
I suppose you're meeting other people?

964
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,716
Take care.

965
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,429
I should stop limping!

966
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,399
I was wondering

967
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,072
what kind of woman

968
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,749
would take such an action.

969
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,795
Putting a personal ad in not only a paper

970
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,192
but a major one.

971
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,835
A major newspaper.

972
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,353
I was thinking,

973
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,157
"ls she an ugly girl"?

974
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,718
That would make sense

975
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,353
but you're not ugly at all.

976
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,429
Well...

977
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,358
I can't tell that myself.

978
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,239
Has the ad been there long?

979
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,309
Quite a few days, right?

980
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,152
Yeah, a few days.

981
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,716
How about the people you've met?

982
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,869
They're OK.

983
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,514
All men?

984
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,954
Of course.

985
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,671
I'm looking for a man.

986
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,432
Of course they're all men.

987
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,196
Have you had any experience?

988
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,597
What experience?

989
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,032
Experience like mine.

990
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,793
Experience with somebody like me.

991
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,870
Have you?

992
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,794
I mean

993
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,150
have you ever thought about

994
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,549
the unhappy relationships you had.

995
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,998
Unhappy relationships?

996
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,831
Have you ever wondered

997
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,751
why the relationships made you unhappy?

998
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,675
Was it because of your personality?

999
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,749
Or his?

1000
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,274
Or maybe it was because of the gender?

1001
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:36,876
The gender?

1002
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:37,837
...could be the cause.

1003
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,355
If you haven't tried it,

1004
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,156
you wouldn't know, would you?

1005
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,674
What haven't I tried?

1006
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,432
Don't get nervous.

1007
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,071
I don't want to make you nervous.

1008
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,873
Can I be blunt?

1009
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,077
Can I ask you a personal question?

1010
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,834
Sure.

1011
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:10,036
Are you...a man or a woman?

1012
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,037
Because... -Good.

1013
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:12,916
I'm sorry. -Good.

1014
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,990
I was waiting for you to ask that.

1015
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,797
I feel you are so nervous.

1016
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,073
No, it's because...

1017
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,111
I'm sorry...

1018
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:20,916
It's okay.

1019
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,150
Don't be nervous.

1020
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,349
It's really nothing!

1021
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,432
No, because I get the impression that...

1022
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,873
I'm a woman!

1023
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,789
I think it depends on

1024
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,633
how you see it.

1025
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,198
No, l...

1026
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,190
Depending on from which angle

1027
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,155
you make your judgment.

1028
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,354
So you're a woman.

1029
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,156
Am I a man, or a woman?

1030
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,832
So you're a woman.

1031
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,400
If you say so.

1032
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,038
I have the characteristics of a woman.

1033
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,839
But I'm looking for a man.

1034
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,353
I'm a man.

1035
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,438
What I'm looking for is

1036
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,317
a "real" man.

1037
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,231
You can think about it.

1038
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,276
No! I'm not one of you...

1039
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,077
Sorry, I'm not saying lesbians are...

1040
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,435
I have nothing against lesbians.

1041
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:06,069
But I want a man.

1042
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,510
I'm not a lesbian. I like women!

1043
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,354
But you're clearly lesbian.

1044
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,237
I'm not and I like women.

1045
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,071
You're a woman, and you like women.

1046
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:14,830
Of course you are.

1047
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,876
You're lesbian!

1048
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,558
I'm sorry. I...

1049
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,350
Actually many people have told me that.

1050
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,557
But like what I just told you

1051
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,749
things aren't either black or white.

1052
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,279
But for me...

1053
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,554
There is a gray area.

1054
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,198
You're either a man or black...

1055
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,270
Sorry, no, either a man or a woman...

1056
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,113
Either black or white. As simple as that.

1057
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,871
How do you know if you don't try?

1058
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,952
You've never tried it before, right?

1059
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,109
But I don't want to try.

1060
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,192
I know what I want.

1061
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,758
Why don't you try men?

1062
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:55,996
I mean, give men a try.

1063
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,429
Men are not bad!

1064
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:11,875
There's something in your hair.

1065
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,871
It's OK. I'll get it.

1066
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,070
I'm sorry.

1067
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,355
Your ears sit high on your head.

1068
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,836
Higher than most people.

1069
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,716
My family said my ears

1070
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,711
were higher than my eyebrows.

1071
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,236
So it seems...

1072
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,435
Yeah, it's a sign of intelligence.

1073
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:49,956
Your ears are higher than

1074
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,837
your eyebrows, too.

1075
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,035
You're talking about yourself!

1076
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,794
You're very smart.

1077
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,272
I think I respond to things quicker

1078
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,350
than most people.

1079
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,109
I'm a salesman. I sell

1080
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,758
personal protection devices.

1081
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,792
Our company has many products.

1082
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,389
Just think about it.

1083
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,674
You may be mugged

1084
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,318
or robbed at any time.

1085
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,632
Raped or kidnapped for ransom

1086
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,790
and all sort of crimes.

1087
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,071
It's like when you're watching a TV drama

1088
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,431
and bang, a commercial comes in.

1089
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,669
We don't have to put up with it,

1090
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,432
do we?

1091
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,358
So I think...

1092
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,788
Let me ask you frankly.

1093
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,630
How could you protect yourself?

1094
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,115
This is a mace-type spray.

1095
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,196
A combination of chili

1096
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,679
and mustard.

1097
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,955
It's not the chili you cook with

1098
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,076
nor the mustard for your sashimi.

1099
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,672
Just press lightly and spray.

1100
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,751
Careful! Don't worry.

1101
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,875
There...

1102
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,436
So many bad people are out there.

1103
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,114
But don't get scared.

1104
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,680
Look at this shock stick.

1105
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,557
It is adjustable and very light.

1106
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,788
You can handle it with one hand.

1107
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,711
Even if a robber has an axe or a blade,

1108
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,948
a sword or a chopper,

1109
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,552
you just press this trigger.

1110
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,514
Don't be afraid!

1111
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,949
This is an 80,000 volt stunner.

1112
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,435
80,000 volt!

1113
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,032
Even the mosquitoes get zapped.

1114
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,189
So do the flies.

1115
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,110
It'll send the robbers

1116
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,189
straight to the hospital.

1117
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,992
It's a bargain.

1118
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,592
It costs $8,000.

1119
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,555
I can give you a discount.

1120
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,357
It's really useful.

1121
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,953
You may wonder what a stunner is.

1122
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:24,551
Right?

1123
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,516
This is called "The Demon".

1124
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,715
It has two switches.

1125
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,790
A safety and the "on" switch.

1126
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,559
Don't be afraid...

1127
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,871
This one is a 200,000 volt stunner.

1128
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,075
200,000 volt.

1129
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,799
When it touches the robber,

1130
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,677
his four limbs will fall off immediately.

1131
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,273
He'll be stunned out of his wits.

1132
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,391
This costs only $3,500.

1133
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,435
A small price

1134
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,556
for peace and safety.

1135
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,871
I recommend this one in particular.

1136
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,557
This is called "The Tracker".

1137
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,432
It has a special...

1138
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,112
A specially designed grip.

1139
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:55,870
Easy to handle.

1140
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,871
It won't harm you.

1141
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,309
It took a Canadian policeman

1142
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,514
7 years to invent it.

1143
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,670
Once you spray the dye

1144
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,313
his face will be covered with it

1145
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,355
Iike a mask.

1146
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,271
His eyes will be totally blinded.

1147
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,991
And this one here, look...

1148
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,718
Hey, don't press it!

1149
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,591
I'm sorry. -It's OK.

1150
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,795
It's alright... I'll sort it out.

1151
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,870
Excuse me...

1152
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,759
No, what I mean is...

1153
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:32,989
Your voice seems different from others.

1154
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,270
Different?

1155
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,269
Of course.

1156
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,429
That's my job.

1157
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,431
I'm a voice actor.

1158
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,395
I can speak in all kinds of

1159
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,719
different voices.

1160
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,514
That's how I earn my living.

1161
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,670
Why did you put an ad in the paper?

1162
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,237
You look pretty good to me.

1163
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,435
Should there be a reason?

1164
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,873
Of course.

1165
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,108
I'd have thought

1166
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,350
it's for old people.

1167
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:06,597
But you are not old.

1168
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:07,589
Maybe you have been hurt...

1169
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,670
I don't know.

1170
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,190
Or you have some illness?

1171
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,189
I want to get married.

1172
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,397
You want to marry, so do l.

1173
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,994
My life feels empty.

1174
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,877
I always speak for other people.

1175
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,154
I don't like it.

1176
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,752
So that's why you're here.

1177
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:27,509
Yes.

1178
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,919
I want to see what kind of girl you are.

1179
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,229
To meet people outside my circle.

1180
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,312
Not bad, you seem gentle and quiet.

1181
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,878
Exactly the kind of girl I'm looking for.

1182
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,791
I talk all day long.

1183
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,870
I talk and fidget a lot.

1184
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,836
I'm looking for a quiet girl

1185
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,398
who can calm me down.

1186
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,153
She'd listen to me and put me at ease.

1187
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:47,797
But if you're talking all day long,

1188
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,552
shouldn't you...

1189
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,152
You're such a lovely girl.

1190
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,718
Why are you so serious?

1191
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:55,868
I'm not.

1192
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:56,990
You're not?

1193
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,239
You are not at peace with yourself, right?

1194
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:05,628
You're so sharp. You must read a lot.

1195
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,631
It has nothing to do with books.

1196
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,074
What then?

1197
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,195
You can't tell, can you?

1198
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,519
I can tell that

1199
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,191
you feel very insecure.

1200
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,555
It's not that I can't tell....

1201
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,668
It's because you're very insecure.

1202
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,949
Cool.

1203
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,030
It's not that. I feel very...

1204
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,439
I can tell it from your body language.

1205
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,709
Look, you keep touching things

1206
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,436
and scratching your head.

1207
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,237
You keep fidgeting.

1208
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,196
It's a sign of insecurity.

1209
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,158
No, it's not.

1210
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,151
Are you aware of your insecurity?

1211
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,514
That's why you're looking for a husband.

1212
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:45,592
You want someone to look after you,

1213
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,749
to protect you.

1214
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,429
Have you found one?

1215
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:53,872
No.

1216
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,074
I...

1217
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,190
I'm still looking.

1218
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,077
That's my point.

1219
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,310
I've met many people.

1220
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:04,312
I'm still looking. I'm trying hard.

1221
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:07,915
Cool.

1222
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,318
So cool. Very cool.

1223
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:13,195
I'm trying hard to find the right person.

1224
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:16,355
So I say I'm the guy

1225
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,998
who can give you security.

1226
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,319
You think you can?

1227
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,435
You're even wearing sun glasses.

1228
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,635
I can't even see your eyes.

1229
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,358
I wear them all the time.

1230
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,998
I feel secure with them on.

1231
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,116
No need to look anyone in the eyes.

1232
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,917
That proves you're insecure as well.

1233
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,235
I just don't like

1234
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:34,434
Iooking straight into the eyes.

1235
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,759
I think it's kind of rude.

1236
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,034
But the eyes are important.

1237
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:38,429
They tell you

1238
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,998
whether one is lying or not.

1239
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,039
This discussion is getting too serious.

1240
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,349
We want to be partners not opponents.

1241
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,750
You're a lovely girl.

1242
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,718
Why do you need to be so defensive?

1243
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,676
No, l...

1244
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,433
I don't think I'm insecure.

1245
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,436
Aren't there women who do dubbing?

1246
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,071
But they're strange.

1247
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:05,717
You know...

1248
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,398
Can you do a few lines?

1249
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,438
A few lines?

1250
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,919
What do you think I am?

1251
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:13,989
An acrobat?

1252
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:14,671
When you meet a clown,

1253
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,112
would you say to him,

1254
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,235
"hey, do somersaults"

1255
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,992
or "play a few tricks for me"?

1256
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,117
It's not what I meant.

1257
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,994
Maruko, stop fooling around.

1258
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,228
Have you finished your homework yet?

1259
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,116
I bet you haven't.

1260
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,156
Your teacher will call me tomorrow.

1261
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,515
Go do your homework!

1262
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,870
Miyuki, we have to work hard.

1263
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,519
We must solve the case

1264
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,158
to save my grandfather's honor.

1265
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:39,559
I can do all sorts of strange voices.

1266
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:43,396
Look, I can do this.

1267
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,148
Miyuki, we must work hard

1268
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,115
in order to...

1269
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:59,709
Maybe I'm not the right man for you.

1270
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,271
And you're not suitable for me.

1271
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,877
Why don't I just admit it that

1272
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,952
this isn't the right way to find a partner.

1273
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,076
I'm just trying to

1274
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,433
occupy myself with something

1275
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,076
to ease the pain you left me.

1276
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,032
Today, a guy asked me

1277
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,957
if I was seeking revenge?

1278
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,358
Am l?

1279
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,832
He said our meeting was only

1280
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,873
an opportunity for me to reject him.

1281
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,951
Or like what Sisy Chen told me.

1282
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:52,030
I can treat the whole process

1283
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,429
as a ceremony.

1284
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,071
I saw her in a restaurant the other day.

1285
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,233
I wanted to know

1286
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:06,749
what she'd do if she was in my shoes.

1287
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,031
I've been thinking...

1288
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,314
If you don't regard time

1289
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,073
as something static but ongoing...

1290
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,195
For example,

1291
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,599
imagine yourself

1292
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,430
as a scriptwriter...

1293
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,634
Or imagine that

1294
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:21,709
you are a director...

1295
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,073
Then you know that

1296
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,832
a story can be developed.

1297
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,432
Time doesn't stop at any precise moment.

1298
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,111
Since it doesn't stop

1299
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,515
you'll see what happens

1300
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:30,873
in the later development.

1301
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:31,869
In that case, you won't feel

1302
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,154
that particular moment is so important.

1303
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,593
You look at the world as a whole.

1304
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,271
It won't stop

1305
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,679
for your tears.

1306
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,796
You know it's only a process.

1307
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,030
Moreover, you may discover...

1308
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,190
If you don't take the responsibility

1309
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,395
for your sadness...

1310
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,550
or bear the burden yourself...

1311
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,391
You think you had hurt someone...

1312
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,791
Actually you'll hurt him

1313
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,189
more in the long run.

1314
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,235
The pain will last longer.

1315
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,639
So if you have come to

1316
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,993
realize this,

1317
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:03,033
you'd be brave enough to deal with it.

1318
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,273
But I feel that

1319
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:05,951
from what you just said,

1320
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,394
you're the one who takes the initiative

1321
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,311
to end the relationship...

1322
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,435
It's not you who cries.

1323
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,959
No, not really.

1324
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:15,269
For example,

1325
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,633
he's the one who wants to end it, right?

1326
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,756
In that case,

1327
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,955
you're forced to accept it.

1328
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,313
You should follow my advice.

1329
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,151
But you'd say you feel so miserable.

1330
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,673
There are two ways.

1331
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:26,669
Normally

1332
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,432
I'd tell people this...

1333
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,429
You feel desperate

1334
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,431
so you want to kill yourself, right?

1335
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,318
But before you do yourself in...

1336
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,435
Go watch a funeral ceremony

1337
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,000
anywhere in Taiwan...

1338
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:37,796
You'll see

1339
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,438
how ugly the curtains are.

1340
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,873
How awful the coffin looks.

1341
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,314
How ugly you'd be dressed.

1342
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,995
And the terrible funeral music!

1343
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,275
That'll make you realize

1344
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,952
it's better to live after all.

1345
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,791
Your pain will be eased to some degree.

1346
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:18,591
So you...

1347
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:21,239
decide which music instruments to buy...

1348
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,114
Yes, the company runs the business.

1349
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,838
There are many people in the office.

1350
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,831
But they know nothing about

1351
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,149
the instruments...

1352
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,159
They're businessmen.

1353
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,639
So you help them choose?

1354
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:34,789
Yes.

1355
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,917
What else do you do?

1356
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,071
Have you ever worn

1357
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,316
a nurse's uniform?

1358
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,315
No?

1359
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,151
You like women in nurse's uniforms?

1360
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,354
Yes.

1361
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,918
They look nice in the uniform.

1362
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,273
They look so innocent.

1363
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,716
I don't mean they're not innocent

1364
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,233
if they don't wear them.

1365
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,555
What the hell am I talking about?

1366
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,636
Where do girls like to go?

1367
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,189
It depends.

1368
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,433
I think...

1369
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:15,874
...girls often end up

1370
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,916
following the guys.

1371
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:18,830
Really?

1372
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:19,431
Yeah.

1373
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:25,750
What if he's into something weird?

1374
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:28,955
How weird?

1375
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:31,668
To be honest with you,

1376
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,716
I really like going to...

1377
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:49,834
Here it is!

1378
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,072
Let me show you first.

1379
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:01,035
Press this. Here.

1380
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:10,438
Hit it like this.

1381
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,435
Harder!

1382
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,073
Let me.

1383
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,431
You've got to watch the back.

1384
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,714
Come on.

1385
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,438
Come on!

1386
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:43,236
Can you tell jokes?

1387
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,429
Jokes!

1388
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,076
The funniest joke is...

1389
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,032
At this point,

1390
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,189
all I need is about...

1391
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:53,351
six or seven hundred thousand dollars!

1392
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,756
Do you wear a nurse's nu-niform?

1393
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,716
Nurse's nu-niform.

1394
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,993
Nurse's U-Nl-FORM.

1395
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,633
Nurse's NU-lN-FORM.

1396
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,791
168cm tall.

1397
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,189
And she must look cute and sweet.

1398
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:25,910
That'd suit me better.

1399
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,911
I am his mother.

1400
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,517
Shouldn't he know

1401
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:41,751
when he wants a drink?

1402
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,954
And when he doesn't?

1403
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,555
He does. He's just too nervous.

1404
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,598
Give the glass to Mama.

1405
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,639
Good boy.

1406
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,276
Mrs. Cheng, I think he...

1407
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,753
What do you think of him?

1408
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,348
What do you think?

1409
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,028
Let me put it this way...

1410
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:15,197
Do you think

1411
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,918
he's fit for marriage?

1412
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,669
Marriage!

1413
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,832
I think he is.

1414
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:22,797
Really?

1415
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,950
He can't even look after himself.

1416
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:25,836
How can he...

1417
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:28,400
I'm looking for someone to look after me.

1418
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,153
He can look after people.

1419
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:32,434
He's just too nervous today.

1420
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:37,039
He's so used to

1421
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:41,068
Iiving in the world of his own.

1422
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,351
Then he's fine with himself.

1423
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:46,440
Why do you want to marry him off?

1424
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:48,275
People must marry.

1425
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:50,191
Humans are social animals.

1426
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,553
But only people who are competent

1427
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,790
should get married.

1428
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,309
He is competent.

1429
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,799
It's just that

1430
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,155
he lives in the world of his own.

1431
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,271
If there is some kind of switch

1432
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,793
that would open him up...

1433
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,752
Perhaps you could be that switch...

1434
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:07,793
You mustn't say that...

1435
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,228
I don't think so.

1436
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:09,831
Besides...

1437
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,957
He's just...

1438
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,234
... a little...

1439
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,079
You could give it a try.

1440
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,752
Try to be his friend.

1441
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,716
Or just be with him.

1442
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,712
He's not used to the outside world.

1443
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,392
We get along well.

1444
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:30,837
He even shares

1445
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:33,877
his spiritual life with me.

1446
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:35,998
He can look after himself.

1447
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,035
Mrs. Cheng.

1448
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,515
Take it easy.

1449
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,274
Are you nervous?

1450
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:45,956
Relax. We're here for coffee.

1451
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:54,109
It's okay. Mom will drink it later.

1452
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,118
He wants me to drink, see?

1453
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,992
It's all right. Mom will drink it later.

1454
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,912
Mom will drink it later,

1455
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:02,150
all right?

1456
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:07,198
He wants me to drink.

1457
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,990
He probably thinks I'm too nervous.

1458
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,719
No one is perfect.

1459
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,757
Maybe you think he's sick

1460
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,432
but I don't.

1461
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,829
I didn't say he's sick.

1462
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,598
But, I think...

1463
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,512
I suggest you shouldn't do it again.

1464
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,239
Alright, I understand how you feel.

1465
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:40,518
But should you be willing...

1466
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,875
Maybe you can think it over.

1467
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,359
Maybe you can be his friend.

1468
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,316
Let's forget about getting married.

1469
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:49,235
Just be friends.

1470
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,800
Try to enter his world.

1471
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,798
We Chinese always talk about "ching".

1472
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,793
The character "ching" has two parts:

1473
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,598
One means "heart", the other means "green"

1474
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,398
The color green...

1475
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,231
We all agree that

1476
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:19,198
"green" signifies life or rebirth.

1477
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,354
So when we say the word "ching",

1478
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,238
it means something ongoing

1479
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,071
not something that burns out quickly.

1480
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,833
It involves consideration,

1481
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:31,276
responsibility and care.

1482
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,357
Love has no responsibility.

1483
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,555
Love is an instinct.

1484
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,437
For example, love is sex.

1485
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,874
It's biologically driven.

1486
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:43,111
But "ching" entails commitment

1487
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,271
and consideration.

1488
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,672
I'm Yu Wen, you're...

1489
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,352
My name is Wu...

1490
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:04,670
How do you do?

1491
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:05,910
How do you do?

1492
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,189
You're really thirsty.

1493
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:17,192
No, usually I bring my own...

1494
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:27,393
When you meet these guys,

1495
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,833
who pays the bills?

1496
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,078
Sometimes they do,

1497
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,991
sometimes we go Dutch...

1498
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:38,994
I can pay for it.

1499
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:46,992
I have a good impression of you...

1500
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:49,989
Thank you.

1501
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:57,157
Let me tell you about myself first.

1502
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,437
I mean, let's not waste time.

1503
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,273
I don't want to go on and on.

1504
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,437
I'll tell you straight.

1505
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,874
All the good and bad things about me.

1506
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,918
The good thing is

1507
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,679
I'm very good!

1508
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,671
I mean I have a good heart.

1509
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:21,591
Yes.

1510
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:26,878
That's the truth. Really.

1511
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:31,038
It's hard to boast about yourself.

1512
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,308
Bad things are easier to talk about.

1513
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:38,158
First of all,

1514
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:39,195
I'm kind of a loner.

1515
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,396
I thought about it all night...

1516
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,030
In fact,

1517
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:43,711
I've been thinking about it

1518
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:44,675
for more than ten years...

1519
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,030
More than twenty years!

1520
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,632
I'm forty-five.

1521
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,596
I'm somewhat reclusive.

1522
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,835
Like after work, I go home

1523
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,638
and I'd just sit there daydreaming.

1524
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,559
Sometimes I think of something...

1525
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:01,629
What do you do?

1526
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,995
I teach Chinese in an elementary school.

1527
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:09,029
I'm often lost in daydreaming.

1528
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,109
I'd sit there for a long time

1529
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,277
as still as a bonsai.

1530
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,877
I can't be like this after I get married.

1531
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:18,678
If you were my wife, I would have to...

1532
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:22,111
But I'm trying

1533
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,510
to become more outgoing...

1534
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,873
My students like me.

1535
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,440
They say sometimes I'm quite funny.

1536
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:33,398
The other thing is I'm thrifty.

1537
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:35,311
Thrifty...stingy!

1538
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,594
People think I'm stingy.

1539
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:37,715
But... I'm not really stingy!

1540
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:38,391
I...

1541
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,632
...just got used to it.

1542
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,349
I do spend when I need to.

1543
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:48,433
Well, I'm influenced by my mom.

1544
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,837
My mom is thrifty

1545
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,512
because our family was poor.

1546
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:54,272
Then my parents had become used to it.

1547
01:15:54,280 --> 01:16:00,037
I thought if she alone was thrifty,

1548
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:01,155
she'd feel lonely.

1549
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,709
So I became thrifty to keep her company.

1550
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,835
My parents live in the south.

1551
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,433
They're in their eighties.

1552
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,876
They're old and hope I'll marry soon.

1553
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:16,352
I would like to marry,

1554
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:19,957
have a child and a family of my own.

1555
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,671
I didn't want to get married

1556
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,508
because I thought that life was too fragile.

1557
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,431
The thought of aging and dying of illness

1558
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,271
was unbearable.

1559
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:38,637
If my wife, my child, my family....

1560
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,072
became old and sick and dead,

1561
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:42,672
I would feel...

1562
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:48,875
it's too much to bear.

1563
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,029
Now I'm getting older...

1564
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,359
Getting...

1565
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:52,911
I've changed.

1566
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,433
I'm able to accept these things.

1567
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,078
So I've said it all.

1568
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:03,399
So now...you know

1569
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:05,554
all good and bad things about me.

1570
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,710
What do you think?

1571
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:09,199
Can we be friends

1572
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:12,112
or something closer?

1573
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,238
What do you think?

1574
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,838
I haven't thought about it yet.

1575
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,238
I'm so sure of my feelings for you.

1576
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,832
You haven't even heard me speak.

1577
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:27,710
And you're so sure of your feelings?

1578
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:30,030
I know what I'm talking about.

1579
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:30,995
I'm not dumb!

1580
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:35,110
I can see you're very...nice.

1581
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:36,711
Very nice.

1582
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:37,436
How do you know?

1583
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,351
You have a pretty forehead.

1584
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:40,716
You can see that from my forehead?

1585
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:45,840
It looks very intelligent, very dignified.

1586
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,158
And your eyes are like a child's.

1587
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,958
They're smiling

1588
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:57,999
and full of wonder.

1589
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,153
They look pure.

1590
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:00,990
And you...

1591
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:03,551
...you smiled twice.

1592
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:06,878
Your smiles are so sweet.

1593
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,796
Have you heard a song called,

1594
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,758
"Everlasting Smile"?

1595
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:14,995
My father used to sing it

1596
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,718
while courting my mother.

1597
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:21,311
"My love..."

1598
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:26,717
"Feel not sorrow nor dejection"

1599
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:32,758
"l wish only that your smile, "

1600
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:36,992
"Goes on forever. "

1601
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:40,359
The last line is really great!

1602
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,073
A very simple line.

1603
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:46,153
Yet it conveys so much emotion.

1604
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,995
Your forehead looks like my mother's.

1605
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:54,270
Mine is like my dad's, a bit broad.

1606
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:54,712
It's very hard

1607
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,233
so I was nicknamed "lron Head".

1608
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,591
It makes a noise when you hit it.

1609
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:02,909
Very loud noise.

1610
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,831
It didn't hurt at all.

1611
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,079
Not at all.

1612
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:15,754
That's how I used to bully my classmates.

1613
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:24,359
Can we be frank now?

1614
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:33,436
Can you say whether you would be

1615
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,591
willing to be with me?

1616
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,871
I mean you don't have to meet

1617
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,519
any more men after this.

1618
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:44,717
Or if you do meet them,

1619
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:48,998
tell them to go away.

1620
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:55,509
Don't you think

1621
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,158
this is a little too sudden?

1622
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,678
But life is short.

1623
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:04,231
But you just said

1624
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:05,514
you spent over twenty years

1625
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,988
deciding whether to get married or not.

1626
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:09,994
And now...

1627
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,151
We've only spent ten, twenty minutes.

1628
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,308
The bad things about me aren't really bad.

1629
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:18,753
They're just my habits.

1630
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:21,354
My characteristics.

1631
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,158
I can make changes, too.

1632
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:27,433
If you want me to change, I can...

1633
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,556
But I have no such plans.

1634
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:32,120
If you think I'm stingy...

1635
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,033
If you want a new dress

1636
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:40,429
or to eat at a steakhouse...

1637
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:45,434
Whatever you say, l'd...

1638
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:50,591
If I want to buy a new dress

1639
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,511
with your month's salary?

1640
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,318
Of course you can.

1641
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:00,193
Are you sure?

1642
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,193
I really want to take you

1643
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,679
to meet my parents.

1644
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,432
How happy would they be!

1645
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:30,116
I always meet these men here.

1646
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,270
Where we came for our first date.

1647
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:35,429
I choose different tables

1648
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:36,509
depending on how I feel

1649
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,276
and who I'm meeting that day...

1650
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,072
But no matter where I sit,

1651
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,833
I always feel secure.

1652
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,430
I can become another person

1653
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,438
and hide my real self.

1654
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,111
My only fear is

1655
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,316
if one day

1656
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:03,115
you walk in all of sudden,

1657
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,319
what should I do?

1658
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:09,796
It was raining really hard that day.

1659
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,878
I was riding my bike.

1660
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,352
A bus went pass.

1661
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,389
I got splashed and soaked through.

1662
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,510
I didn't want to meet you like that.

1663
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:26,280
So I didn't come up.

1664
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,109
Have you always been so timid

1665
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,953
and unsure of yourself?

1666
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:41,152
Actually, I spent time in jail.

1667
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,277
I was inside for a year and a half.

1668
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,111
Are you surprised to hear this?

1669
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:58,433
It had nothing to do with me.

1670
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,511
My father was passing bad checks.

1671
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:11,839
He couldn't pay back the money, so l...

1672
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,672
I hope you aren't put off.

1673
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:27,514
I worked as a mail inspector

1674
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,431
while I was in jail.

1675
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,434
I looked well-behaved.

1676
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:38,077
So I was asked to check the mails.

1677
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,351
I read people's letters every day.

1678
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,713
It was fun.

1679
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:49,196
I got to know their secrets.

1680
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:00,192
I was engaged before I went in.

1681
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,795
But she left me soon after.

1682
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:10,953
I don't blame her.

1683
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:17,350
Everyone wants to marry a decent guy.

1684
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:18,794
Do you tell this

1685
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,791
to every girl you meet?

1686
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:21,357
About...

1687
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,759
No.

1688
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,273
It's not something I'm proud of.

1689
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:27,759
Then why did you tell me?

1690
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:33,878
I didn't want to waste your time.

1691
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:37,599
I had gone out with a few girls.

1692
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:38,749
I didn't tell them at first.

1693
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:41,668
But when I did tell them,

1694
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:46,073
they...started to avoid me

1695
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,152
and gradually disappeared.

1696
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:51,595
So I thought...

1697
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:57,155
I feel something for this guy.

1698
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:03,353
I think our relationship

1699
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,716
would not end in this place.

1700
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:09,079
What makes me feel this way

1701
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,952
isn't his looks

1702
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,798
or his frankness.

1703
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:18,952
He had this strange smile.

1704
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,353
It looks like my own.

1705
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,229
A smile of awkwardness

1706
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:25,958
and helplessness.

1707
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:30,310
Surely you can understand it.

1708
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:35,792
Others may not but you definitely can.

1709
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:43,911
But what should I do with him?

1710
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,115
He suggested we could go fishing.

1711
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:51,350
But I thought we should

1712
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:54,109
sleep with each other.

1713
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,991
Do you know how scared I was?

1714
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:16,790
I was so scared.

1715
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:19,796
It was the first time

1716
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:21,438
the hospital terrified me.

1717
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:28,237
Lying on the operating table...

1718
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:31,435
I really prayed for the courage

1719
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:33,954
to keep the baby.

1720
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:43,311
But I didn't.

1721
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,116
So heartless of me.

1722
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,911
Where were you then?

1723
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:57,634
Where were you?

1724
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:07,675
Do you know I get so scared

1725
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:10,433
every time I come home?

1726
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,353
Like I just said.

1727
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:20,032
Honestly,

1728
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:22,395
these things I'm telling you to do...

1729
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,552
I probably couldn't do myself.

1730
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:28,236
Choose what you can endure

1731
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,033
and move on.

1732
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:32,110
But I've endured so much pain!

1733
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:38,718
Pain makes you rise above everything.

1734
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:42,390
If everything goes smoothly,

1735
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:44,272
you'd never grow up.

1736
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:49,189
Actually...

1737
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:59,430
I'm not really attracted to women.

1738
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:05,639
What do you mean?

1739
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,676
I like men.

1740
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:14,795
I knew this from a very young age.

1741
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,276
But I also knew

1742
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:24,833
I wanted to lead

1743
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:27,197
a "normal" life.

1744
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:29,039
You're not saying this just to console me?

1745
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:30,439
Making your life so much worse

1746
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:32,829
so I'll feel better.

1747
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:39,077
No, what about you?

1748
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,672
And your troubles?

1749
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:44,911
My life seems a bit better than yours.

1750
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:16,591
Are you Mr. Wang?

1751
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:18,877
Is that Miss Wu?

1752
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:20,156
Yes.

1753
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:23,392
Can you help me? I'm Mr. Wang.

1754
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:27,436
Can I take your arm?

1755
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:29,438
Sorry.

1756
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:33,552
Have you been waiting long?

1757
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:34,995
That's all right.

1758
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:37,036
Here. Please have a seat.

1759
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:38,439
Thank you.

1760
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:42,589
Thank you.

1761
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,278
Mr. Wang, your eyes...

1762
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:51,714
My eyes? -Completely?

1763
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:54,109
Yes, completely blind.

1764
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:58,117
Were you born blind?

1765
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:00,156
Yes.

1766
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,839
Did the doctor say anything about it?

1767
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,515
Atrophy of the optic nerve.

1768
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,639
Then how could you read my ad?

1769
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:16,551
I didn't.

1770
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,278
My friend told me about it.

1771
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:20,430
And I gave you a call.

1772
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:23,071
I am sorry.

1773
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:26,874
What do you do

1774
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,916
apart from being a musician?

1775
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,035
Nothing really.

1776
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:34,752
But sometimes if I need extra money,

1777
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:36,432
I'd go busking in the pedestrian tunnel.

1778
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:37,436
The tunnel?

1779
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,192
Yes. You probably gave me money before.

1780
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:40,599
You just don't remember.

1781
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:42,554
Which tunnel?

1782
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,039
Any tunnel.

1783
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:48,399
Next time maybe you'll see me there again.

1784
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,311
Please be generous!

1785
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,991
I don't think your name is Wu.

1786
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:02,038
It is Wu.

1787
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:06,752
Your surname is Tu, isn't it?

1788
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,399
Don't you recognize me?

1789
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,431
Do I look familiar?

1790
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:28,429
Several years ago, you treated my eyes.

1791
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:30,637
You're an eye doctor, aren't you?

1792
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:31,834
Dr. Tu.

1793
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:37,719
Are you okay?

1794
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:42,029
Yes, my name is Tu Chia-chen.

1795
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:43,952
I'm sorry. I meant no harm.

1796
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:45,553
No, I'm sorry...

1797
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:47,759
I really meant no harm.

1798
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,990
No, I'm sorry I shouldn't have lied.

1799
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:52,992
When we spoke on the phone,

1800
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,956
I thought it was you.

1801
01:32:57,640 --> 01:32:58,595
Why?

1802
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,313
I recognized your voice.

1803
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:02,436
I was your patient.

1804
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:04,357
Your voice sounded familiar on the phone.

1805
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:07,313
You should be Dr. Tu.

1806
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:08,639
How could it be Wu?

1807
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:11,438
So I felt I must come.

1808
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:13,275
But I apologize.

1809
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:16,556
On the phone, I said my eyes were bad.

1810
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:19,190
I didn't tell you I was blind.

1811
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:21,711
Are you disappointed?

1812
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:26,031
It's just that I didn't expect...

1813
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:27,719
Not disappointed?

1814
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,431
I thought...

1815
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:45,113
I didn't expect

1816
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:48,111
a blind person would

1817
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:50,509
turn up and consider...

1818
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:53,796
It's natural that you're disappointed.

1819
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:55,669
Yeah.

1820
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:58,749
But why do you call yourself Wu?

1821
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:03,437
Isn't Tu good enough? -Actually...

1822
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,394
Tu!

1823
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:11,200
Have you got used to being Miss Wu?

1824
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:14,999
I sometimes forget.

1825
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:16,679
Often?

1826
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:21,276
When you've been lying long enough...

1827
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:25,151
Our eyes can never lie.

1828
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:30,029
You can be Miss Wu or Miss Tu.

1829
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,197
No disrespect intended.

1830
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:33,836
I can never lie

1831
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,796
because of my eyes.

1832
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:37,279
My eyes are a kind of marks on me.

1833
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:41,674
I can never see anything.

1834
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:46,708
So I might as well not tell any lies.

1835
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:49,833
When you realize

1836
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,558
I was Dr. Tu on the phone,

1837
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:53,993
weren't you afraid?

1838
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,355
Why should I be afraid?

1839
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:57,679
I was being cheeky...

1840
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:59,238
I wanted to expose you.

1841
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:10,113
My name isn't the issue.

1842
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:12,629
I just wanted to be

1843
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:14,679
cut off from my past.

1844
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,555
But using another surname

1845
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:21,070
as a disguise....

1846
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:22,994
Do you enjoy it?

1847
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:25,919
When you've been lying long enough,

1848
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:27,793
you'll get used to it.

1849
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:28,915
Is that so?

1850
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:30,433
But I don't enjoy it.

1851
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:33,435
Sometimes, I feel it's absurd.

1852
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,994
I'm looking for a husband.

1853
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,230
But I can't tell him my real surname.

1854
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:40,150
But...

1855
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:42,990
It's possible that

1856
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:43,989
I could meet someone with whom

1857
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,116
I'd spend the rest of my life.

1858
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:49,310
In that case, I'm probably

1859
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:15,197
I think I should stop

1860
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,236
meeting these men.

1861
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,876
Because I find it scary.

1862
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:23,149
Each time I meet someone,

1863
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:25,117
without hesitation,

1864
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:27,918
he tells me his secrets, his desires.

1865
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:31,758
I feel I wasn't talking to him

1866
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:34,396
but peeping through the keyhole.

1867
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:38,672
They are always in the light.

1868
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:41,276
And I'm in the shadows.

1869
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:43,714
But how do I get in the light?

1870
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:49,755
Hello? -l...

1871
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:53,436
Hello?

1872
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:26,872
Hello?

1873
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:34,439
Doctor Tu?

1874
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:37,589
I'm sorry...

1875
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:39,671
It's me who should apologize.

1876
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:42,396
I've been listening to your calls.

1877
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:44,952
I should say I've been eavesdropping.

1878
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:49,834
Are you Mrs. Wu?

1879
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:51,155
Yes.

1880
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:53,671
I've been back in Taiwan for some time.

1881
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:56,276
I listened to your messages by accident.

1882
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:59,358
I know it's weird

1883
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:01,430
to let you call every day.

1884
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:03,554
I'm sorry.

1885
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:07,909
I didn't know you had come back.

1886
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:11,434
I came here after the accident.

1887
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,712
The accident?

1888
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,797
So you don't know

1889
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,752
my husband's dead.

1890
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:24,593
He flew from Phnom Penh

1891
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:25,919
to catch a plane back to Taiwan.

1892
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:29,159
The plane crashed in Vietnam.

1893
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:36,989
Dr. Tu, I know it's hard for you to bear.

1894
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:40,350
It's hard for me, too.

1895
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:43,314
But today I was determined

1896
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:44,594
to speak to you on the phone

1897
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:48,196
To tell you that you should stop calling.

1898
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:52,635
He's no longer here to answer it.

1899
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:56,398
The last time he came to me

1900
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:59,400
was to tell me about your affair.

1901
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:04,238
He told me you were pregnant

1902
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:06,071
and you wanted the baby.

1903
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:11,397
I knew him too well.

1904
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:14,080
It took a lot for him to tell me this.

1905
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:17,311
He kept apologizing

1906
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:19,750
but he was adamant.

1907
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:25,160
I cried. So did he.

1908
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:30,432
He left very early next morning.

1909
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:35,510
After the accident, I was full of hate.

1910
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:39,830
I hated him and I hated you even more.

1911
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:42,992
How could you bring such disaster

1912
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,433
to my family?

1913
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:48,076
He was willing to give everything up

1914
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:49,638
for the sake of a woman

1915
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:52,676
I'd never even met?!

1916
01:39:55,880 --> 01:39:57,757
After the first message,

1917
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:00,315
I hoped you'd keep calling.

1918
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:02,873
I wanted to know

1919
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:05,189
everything between you two.

1920
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:08,149
Some evenings,

1921
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:10,355
I sat waiting for your call.

1922
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:13,599
At times I was so tempted to

1923
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:15,591
pick up the phone and scream.

1924
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,949
But I can't listen to you anymore.

1925
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:22,911
I feel...

1926
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:26,239
I'm doing something really cruel.

1927
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:30,878
I answered the phone today

1928
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:34,430
just to ask you to stop.

1929
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:40,956
Fate has been unfair to all of us.

1930
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:45,397
At first I felt satisfaction

1931
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:48,148
from your misery.

1932
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,915
But now I've calmed down.

1933
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:56,116
I know at last

1934
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,919
why things happened the way they did.

1935
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:02,391
Listening to your messages

1936
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,639
made me realize

1937
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:08,677
I never committed myself

1938
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:15,112
to him as you did.

1939
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:19,552
I can't do that for anyone.

1940
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:26,032
So why should I bear grudges?

1941
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:29,640
Thank you for bringing peace to me.

1942
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:59,868
I can now bring myself to face a new life.

1943
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:02,511
Wu Chia-chen, how are you?

1944
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:06,272
I don't know what to say.

1945
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:08,150
This is my second message today.

1946
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:11,555
If it's possible,

1947
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:13,871
can I see you again?

1948
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:15,598
To give up now would be too easy.

1949
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:18,876
If you don't want to contact me,

1950
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:21,588
I'll drop by the teahouse.

1951
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:25,037
Maybe we'll run into each other.
