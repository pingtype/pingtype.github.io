1
00:01:04,371 --> 00:01:05,911
Master Li is here!

2
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,750
Master Li is here!

3
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:24,451
Shu Lien!

4
00:01:30,212 --> 00:01:32,372
Li Mu Bai is here!

5
00:01:39,263 --> 00:01:41,803
How's everything? Fine. Please come in.

6
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:56,015
Mu Bai, it's been too long.

7
00:01:56,195 --> 00:01:57,315
It has.

8
00:01:57,655 --> 00:01:59,945
How's business? Good.

9
00:02:00,116 --> 00:02:01,946
And how are you? Fine.

10
00:02:07,046 --> 00:02:09,086
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.

11
00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:12,037
He said you were practicing deep meditation.

12
00:02:13,927 --> 00:02:15,387
The mountain must be so peaceful...

13
00:02:15,847 --> 00:02:17,637
I envy you.

14
00:02:17,808 --> 00:02:21,508
My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.

15
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:25,978
I left the training early.

16
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:31,899
Why? You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.

17
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:34,729
During my meditation training...

18
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,660
I came to a place of deep silence...

19
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,070
I was surrounded by light...

20
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,330
Time and space disappeared.

21
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:50,131
I had come to a place my master had never told me about.

22
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,172
You were enlightened?

23
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:55,892
No.

24
00:02:56,222 --> 00:02:59,502
I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.

25
00:02:59,682 --> 00:03:05,192
Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.

26
00:03:05,563 --> 00:03:08,143
I couldn't bear it.

27
00:03:08,863 --> 00:03:10,653
I broke off my meditation.

28
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,644
I couldn't go on.

29
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:17,114
There was something... pulling me back.

30
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:19,705
What was it?

31
00:03:23,295 --> 00:03:25,365
Something I can't let go of.

32
00:03:29,636 --> 00:03:30,716
You're leaving soon?

33
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:35,136
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery

34
00:03:35,306 --> 00:03:36,506
to Peking.

35
00:03:36,977 --> 00:03:38,217
Perhaps I could ask you

36
00:03:38,977 --> 00:03:42,017
to deliver something to Sir Te for me.

37
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:49,448
The Green Destiny sword? You're giving it to Sir Te?

38
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:53,068
I am. He has always been our greatest protector.

39
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:56,159
I don't understand. How can you part with it?

40
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:58,899
It has always been with you.

41
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,369
Too many men have died at its edge.

42
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,540
It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.

43
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:15,421
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.

44
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:20,811
It's time for me to leave it behind.

45
00:04:20,982 --> 00:04:23,902
So what will you do now?

46
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:28,932
Come with me to Peking.

47
00:04:29,113 --> 00:04:32,113
You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself.

48
00:04:32,283 --> 00:04:34,853
It'll be just like old times.

49
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:40,283
First I must visit my master's grave.

50
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,784
It's been many years since...

51
00:04:43,174 --> 00:04:46,504
Jade Fox murdered him. I have yet to avenge his death.

52
00:04:46,675 --> 00:04:49,715
And yet I'm thinking of quitting.

53
00:04:49,885 --> 00:04:52,725
I must pray for his forgiveness.

54
00:04:52,895 --> 00:04:57,435
Join me once you have finished.

55
00:04:57,606 --> 00:04:59,926
I can wait for you in Peking.

56
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:02,556
Perhaps.

57
00:05:09,827 --> 00:05:10,857
Ok. Pass.

58
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:12,607
Thanks.

59
00:05:12,788 --> 00:05:14,698
Let's go into the city.

60
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:28,639
Everything got here safely. I'm much obliged.

61
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:31,839
Just doing my job.

62
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,390
Sun Security has been the best since your father started it.

63
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,770
You're a credit to his memory.

64
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,021
Thank you.

65
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:44,231
I mean it.

66
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:22,895
This is Li Mu Bai's personal sword,

67
00:06:23,486 --> 00:06:25,446
a great hero's weapon.

68
00:06:25,616 --> 00:06:31,946
He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.

69
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:35,326
It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.

70
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:36,617
Sir Te...

71
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:39,087
it has brought him as much trouble as glory.

72
00:06:39,717 --> 00:06:42,037
Help him to leave these troubles behind.

73
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:44,968
Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.

74
00:06:46,018 --> 00:06:47,258
All right.

75
00:06:47,428 --> 00:06:49,218
I'll act as the sword's custodian.

76
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:54,189
Governor Yu has arrived.

77
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:55,549
I must change.

78
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:59,239
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.

79
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,360
Please accept our thanks.

80
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:06,110
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest.

81
00:07:07,951 --> 00:07:10,111
Now, Shu Lien...

82
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:12,331
tell me something.

83
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:15,041
And forgive me for prying.

84
00:07:15,211 --> 00:07:17,961
Your father was a great friend to me,

85
00:07:18,132 --> 00:07:21,332
and I think of you as my own daughter.

86
00:07:21,512 --> 00:07:23,582
Please, Sir Te, what is it?

87
00:07:23,972 --> 00:07:27,142
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword

88
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,683
and his warrior days...

89
00:07:29,853 --> 00:07:32,853
Maybe he's trying to tell you something?

90
00:07:33,483 --> 00:07:34,683
I don't know...

91
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:39,274
Don't be coy. I've always known about your feelings for each other.

92
00:07:39,444 --> 00:07:41,654
All these years, it's a shame...

93
00:07:41,824 --> 00:07:45,984
...neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other.

94
00:07:47,165 --> 00:07:50,575
You're both wasting precious time.

95
00:07:50,955 --> 00:07:56,205
I beg your pardon. Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.

96
00:07:57,676 --> 00:07:59,796
When it comes to emotions,

97
00:07:59,966 --> 00:08:04,046
even great heroes can be idiots.

98
00:08:04,227 --> 00:08:09,807
Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.

99
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:13,928
I'll give him an earful!

100
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:24,579
Sir Te said to leave the sword in here.

101
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,790
Who are you?

102
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,790
I'm your guest today.

103
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:40,261
I am Governor Yu's daughter.

104
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:43,801
This is Sir Te's study. You are here to?

105
00:08:44,471 --> 00:08:48,891
I was just looking for a quiet corner.

106
00:08:49,772 --> 00:08:51,152
I am Sir Te's head servant.

107
00:08:51,312 --> 00:08:53,192
And this is another of our guests.

108
00:09:06,124 --> 00:09:09,544
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!

109
00:09:09,714 --> 00:09:12,414
The handle is heavy. And the blade is no ordinary metal.

110
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,635
Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons.

111
00:09:16,805 --> 00:09:19,125
You're just not used to handling it.

112
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:21,845
But, I have had much practice.

113
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:24,136
As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.

114
00:09:24,306 --> 00:09:26,306
They'd let me play with their weapons.

115
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:29,976
The scabbard is so beautiful.

116
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:33,687
Beautiful but dangerous.

117
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:37,477
Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.

118
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:41,078
It's 400 years old.

119
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:42,998
Exquisite!

120
00:09:44,038 --> 00:09:46,748
You said it belongs to...

121
00:09:47,249 --> 00:09:51,119
My friend Li Mu Bai. He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.

122
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:52,459
Li Mu Bai!

123
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:55,839
The famous warrior?

124
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,100
Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?

125
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,670
You're too young to understand.

126
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,390
You're a sword fighter too?

127
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:05,481
Yes, I am.

128
00:10:05,651 --> 00:10:07,471
But I prefer the machete.

129
00:10:07,651 --> 00:10:11,981
Certain moves, however, call for a sword.

130
00:10:13,372 --> 00:10:14,452
Really?

131
00:10:16,872 --> 00:10:19,832
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!

132
00:10:20,212 --> 00:10:23,912
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust,

133
00:10:24,093 --> 00:10:26,793
integrity... Without rules,

134
00:10:26,963 --> 00:10:29,343
we wouldn't survive for long.

135
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:32,043
I've read all about people like you.

136
00:10:32,224 --> 00:10:35,054
Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!

137
00:10:35,224 --> 00:10:38,184
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.

138
00:10:38,354 --> 00:10:40,894
But you're just like the characters in the stories.

139
00:10:41,065 --> 00:10:45,395
Sure. No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds...

140
00:10:45,575 --> 00:10:47,695
They tell you all about that in those books?

141
00:10:47,865 --> 00:10:49,905
You know what I mean.

142
00:10:50,456 --> 00:10:54,236
I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.

143
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,366
So I heard. Congratulations.

144
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,941
It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?

145
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:09,062
You're not married, are you?

146
00:11:10,532 --> 00:11:11,522
What do you think?

147
00:11:11,702 --> 00:11:13,902
No! You couldn't roam around freely if you were.

148
00:11:15,323 --> 00:11:17,703
You're probably right.

149
00:11:50,036 --> 00:11:52,486
Go ahead, Governor Yu.

150
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:05,248
2 feet 9 inches long.

151
00:12:05,878 --> 00:12:07,458
1 inch wide.

152
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:11,009
The handle is 1 inch deep, 2.6 inches wide.

153
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:14,839
7 tenths of an inch thick.

154
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,639
With seven rubies missing from the hilt.

155
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,430
You can tell the design

156
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,060
dates back to before the Chin era.

157
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,240
Engraved with a technique lost by the time of the Han Dynasty.

158
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:29,901
Your knowledge is remarkable, Sir Te.

159
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:33,281
A sword by itself rules nothing.

160
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:35,741
It comes alive only through skillful manipulation.

161
00:12:37,162 --> 00:12:40,172
I see your point. Please continue.

162
00:12:40,332 --> 00:12:43,422
The Imperial Court isn't the problem.

163
00:12:43,593 --> 00:12:47,293
With royalty and officials everywhere,

164
00:12:47,763 --> 00:12:52,303
the Royal Guard keeps security tight.

165
00:12:52,474 --> 00:12:54,464
But Peking is not like the West.

166
00:12:54,644 --> 00:12:58,974
Here, you'll find all sorts of characters.

167
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:02,184
Proceed with caution in your quest for law and order.

168
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,565
Don't depend only on the court.

169
00:13:04,735 --> 00:13:08,325
Contacts in the Giang Hu underworld

170
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:11,245
can ensure your position.

171
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,536
Be strong yet supple.

172
00:13:17,706 --> 00:13:19,746
This is the way to rule.

173
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,240
Governess...

174
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,190
Let me do it.

175
00:13:56,091 --> 00:13:57,251
Please sit.

176
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,501
I've made you silk pajamas. Do you want to change into them?

177
00:14:00,671 --> 00:14:02,051
Put them down.

178
00:14:08,262 --> 00:14:10,932
I heard you met Shu Lien today.

179
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:13,233
Do you know her?

180
00:14:14,443 --> 00:14:15,723
She's one of those.

181
00:14:16,483 --> 00:14:19,403
Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.

182
00:14:21,234 --> 00:14:23,734
I'll socialize with whomever I please.

183
00:14:24,284 --> 00:14:27,034
Don't invite danger into your father's house.

184
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:30,985
I'm tired now!

185
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,585
Go to bed then.

186
00:14:37,255 --> 00:14:39,745
Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.

187
00:14:41,636 --> 00:14:44,086
God knows what the future will bring.

188
00:14:45,306 --> 00:14:46,926
It'll be just the same.

189
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:50,387
Enough! I'm tired.

190
00:14:54,357 --> 00:14:55,767
Autumn is coming.

191
00:14:55,948 --> 00:14:58,098
I'll shut the windows for you.

192
00:15:24,851 --> 00:15:27,011
Chilly, eh? Yes, Master Bo.

193
00:16:27,628 --> 00:16:28,788
Someone help!

194
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,458
Stop him!

195
00:16:30,628 --> 00:16:32,038
He's on the roof!

196
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:36,089
The sword's been stolen!

197
00:16:38,849 --> 00:16:39,679
Stop thief!

198
00:17:05,622 --> 00:17:07,332
Stop him!

199
00:17:07,502 --> 00:17:09,132
It's Jade Fox!

200
00:17:09,883 --> 00:17:11,453
We must avenge Mother!

201
00:17:14,263 --> 00:17:16,793
Do something! He's getting away!

202
00:17:19,514 --> 00:17:22,004
Return the sword and I'll let you go.

203
00:17:27,565 --> 00:17:28,975
You've been trained at Wudan?

204
00:17:34,135 --> 00:17:35,795
You're mistaken.

205
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,676
We're just street performers. We were rehearsing.

206
00:17:38,856 --> 00:17:39,636
Father!

207
00:17:40,606 --> 00:17:41,716
You were rehearsing?

208
00:17:41,896 --> 00:17:43,636
Who are you trying to fool?

209
00:17:43,857 --> 00:17:45,597
Where did that thief go?

210
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,698
Governor Yu's house!

211
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,100
Get down here!

212
00:19:58,712 --> 00:19:59,832
Give back the sword!

213
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,290
Sir Te awaits you.

214
00:21:19,341 --> 00:21:23,121
I'm sure the thief is in the Yu household.

215
00:21:23,301 --> 00:21:24,381
How dare you imply?

216
00:21:25,222 --> 00:21:26,172
Enough!

217
00:21:38,693 --> 00:21:41,023
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?

218
00:21:41,453 --> 00:21:45,403
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.

219
00:21:45,584 --> 00:21:48,454
But the sword could be in his compound.

220
00:21:52,295 --> 00:21:56,795
Then someone's trying to set him up.

221
00:21:56,965 --> 00:21:59,205
We should inform Li Mu Bai.

222
00:22:09,437 --> 00:22:10,347
What is it?

223
00:22:10,527 --> 00:22:12,567
Madam Yu, someone's put up posters.

224
00:22:18,158 --> 00:22:19,698
Let me see.

225
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:28,329
Someone is after a Jade Fox.

226
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:30,709
Preposterous, looking for her here!

227
00:23:07,213 --> 00:23:09,703
Where are they? I don't know.

228
00:23:10,964 --> 00:23:13,834
I haven't seen them in two days.

229
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,470
There's a Miss Shu Lien here to see you.

230
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,060
Miss is busy right now.

231
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,520
I'll tell her.

232
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,360
Show her in.

233
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:23,571
This spells trouble.

234
00:24:25,292 --> 00:24:26,702
I have a guest.

235
00:24:33,933 --> 00:24:35,213
This way please.

236
00:24:42,234 --> 00:24:43,474
I've missed you.

237
00:24:43,644 --> 00:24:44,474
How so?

238
00:24:44,644 --> 00:24:46,304
I'm bored...

239
00:24:52,995 --> 00:24:54,655
You're doing calligraphy?

240
00:24:56,415 --> 00:24:58,205
I'll write your name.

241
00:24:58,626 --> 00:24:59,736
Just for fun.

242
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:28,739
I never realized my name looks like "sword".

243
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:33,739
You write gracefully. Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.

244
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,200
Maybe it is. I wouldn't know.

245
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,910
Please.

246
00:25:43,461 --> 00:25:46,711
Thank you for seeing me. I hear your wedding day is near.

247
00:25:46,881 --> 00:25:49,011
You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.

248
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:52,961
I'm hardly doing a thing. The less I think of it the better.

249
00:25:53,142 --> 00:25:58,102
My parents are arranging everything.

250
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:02,402
The Gous are a very powerful family.

251
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:06,733
My marrying one will be good for my father's career.

252
00:26:06,903 --> 00:26:10,573
You are fortunate to marry into such a noble family.

253
00:26:11,034 --> 00:26:12,114
Am I?

254
00:26:12,284 --> 00:26:15,494
I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.

255
00:26:15,664 --> 00:26:17,154
Like you and Li Mu Bai.

256
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:21,875
I guess I'm happy to be marrying.

257
00:26:22,045 --> 00:26:25,085
But to be free to live my own life,

258
00:26:25,256 --> 00:26:27,466
to choose whom I love...

259
00:26:28,266 --> 00:26:31,096
That is true happiness.

260
00:26:31,686 --> 00:26:33,836
Do you think so? Let me tell you a story...

261
00:26:34,057 --> 00:26:35,607
About you and Li Mu Bai?

262
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:37,017
Yes.

263
00:26:37,187 --> 00:26:40,357
Did you know I was once engaged to be married?

264
00:26:41,027 --> 00:26:41,977
No, really?

265
00:26:42,147 --> 00:26:43,947
His name was Meng Si Zhao.

266
00:26:44,368 --> 00:26:47,198
He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath.

267
00:26:47,368 --> 00:26:49,568
One day, while in battle,

268
00:26:49,738 --> 00:26:53,738
he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.

269
00:26:53,999 --> 00:26:57,499
After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.

270
00:26:57,709 --> 00:26:59,749
Our feelings for each other grew stronger.

271
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,379
But how could we dishonor

272
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,170
Meng's memory?

273
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,210
So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.

274
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,630
But I have never tasted it.

275
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:15,391
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.

276
00:27:17,691 --> 00:27:20,941
I am not an aristocrat, as you are...

277
00:27:21,112 --> 00:27:25,742
but I must still respect a woman's duties.

278
00:27:26,322 --> 00:27:28,032
Don't distance us.

279
00:27:28,203 --> 00:27:32,363
From now on, let's be like sisters.

280
00:27:35,003 --> 00:27:38,333
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.

281
00:28:14,748 --> 00:28:17,418
What a godforsaken place!

282
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:22,428
Can't your father be appointed closer to civilization?

283
00:28:25,139 --> 00:28:26,379
Jen...

284
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:28,799
are you listening to me?

285
00:28:57,303 --> 00:28:58,493
Let's go.

286
00:29:22,866 --> 00:29:24,496
Who are you?

287
00:29:25,076 --> 00:29:27,746
Wait! I'm a friend!

288
00:29:31,457 --> 00:29:34,217
I don't care about your sword.

289
00:29:34,377 --> 00:29:36,507
Why were you spying on the Yus?

290
00:29:36,677 --> 00:29:39,507
I'm looking for someone. Jade Fox.

291
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:43,098
I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.

292
00:29:44,018 --> 00:29:47,548
Jade Fox is a master criminal. I hear she infiltrated the Yus.

293
00:29:48,058 --> 00:29:51,848
She must have come with them when they transferred here.

294
00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:56,439
But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.

295
00:29:56,659 --> 00:29:58,609
This Jade Fox is a woman? Yes.

296
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,780
Then leave her to me.

297
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,490
Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her.

298
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,200
My wife was quite a martial arts expert.

299
00:30:07,371 --> 00:30:08,751
Jade Fox killed her.

300
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:10,911
So you see,

301
00:30:11,091 --> 00:30:14,211
this is personal. Leave her to me.

302
00:30:14,762 --> 00:30:16,332
It's ready.

303
00:30:17,132 --> 00:30:18,002
I'm ready for anything!

304
00:30:19,722 --> 00:30:21,632
Father gets first dip.

305
00:30:26,063 --> 00:30:27,143
They're gone!

306
00:30:29,313 --> 00:30:30,513
What does it say?

307
00:30:30,693 --> 00:30:33,893
"We'll settle this at midnight on Yellow Hill."

308
00:30:34,074 --> 00:30:36,744
Good! The fox is out of her hole!

309
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:44,245
Shu Lien, look who's here.

310
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:53,465
Sir Te believes it's a ploy to cast suspicion on Governor Yu.

311
00:30:53,636 --> 00:30:56,916
But something is going on at the Yu household.

312
00:30:57,096 --> 00:30:58,756
What have you discovered?

313
00:31:11,158 --> 00:31:12,528
Jade Fox?

314
00:31:13,028 --> 00:31:13,858
Impossible!

315
00:31:14,028 --> 00:31:16,738
You'd always suspected she'd fled to the West.

316
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:19,369
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!

317
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:22,489
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?

318
00:31:25,129 --> 00:31:28,909
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.

319
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,540
Be careful.

320
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,290
Sir Te requires discretion.

321
00:31:35,471 --> 00:31:37,711
Official business is difficult enough.

322
00:31:37,891 --> 00:31:41,421
Don't let personal feelings make it worse.

323
00:31:42,021 --> 00:31:44,811
And I don't know... even this poster...

324
00:31:44,982 --> 00:31:46,852
could be some sort of trap.

325
00:31:49,482 --> 00:31:50,982
Did you see who posted it?

326
00:31:51,402 --> 00:31:52,322
No.

327
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,693
It says Fox is hiding at Yu's.

328
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:57,953
On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.

329
00:31:58,873 --> 00:32:00,743
Were you involved?

330
00:32:00,914 --> 00:32:02,904
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.

331
00:32:03,084 --> 00:32:05,924
I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.

332
00:32:06,084 --> 00:32:07,634
Have you questioned him yet?

333
00:32:08,044 --> 00:32:10,124
No, not yet...

334
00:32:10,635 --> 00:32:12,625
But your men are watching over Yu's compound?

335
00:32:13,845 --> 00:32:16,555
No, I'd already sent them home.

336
00:32:18,185 --> 00:32:20,255
You can blame me for losing the sword,

337
00:32:20,436 --> 00:32:22,646
but please trust that I'll get it back soon

338
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,806
using my own methods.

339
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:27,646
That's not what I meant.

340
00:32:27,817 --> 00:32:29,527
I don't care about the sword.

341
00:32:30,117 --> 00:32:33,647
What do you mean? Didn't you come back here for it?

342
00:32:34,157 --> 00:32:37,607
I didn't know it was stolen until I got here.

343
00:32:38,918 --> 00:32:40,828
Then, why did you come?

344
00:32:42,918 --> 00:32:45,788
Well, we had talked...

345
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:50,959
Pardon my intrusion. Master Li,

346
00:32:51,139 --> 00:32:52,929
your room is ready.

347
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:55,890
Thank you.

348
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,100
Please, lead the way.

349
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:12,401
The Fox doesn't care much for punctuality.

350
00:33:12,582 --> 00:33:14,732
Still no sign of her.

351
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,213
Enough! Show yourself!

352
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:29,883
Tsai...

353
00:33:30,224 --> 00:33:31,594
You dog!

354
00:33:31,764 --> 00:33:33,594
You will pay for your stubbornness!

355
00:33:34,184 --> 00:33:36,724
That's what you think, old witch!

356
00:33:36,894 --> 00:33:39,934
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.

357
00:33:40,445 --> 00:33:42,595
But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.

358
00:33:43,445 --> 00:33:44,275
Father!

359
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:46,605
Let me avenge my mother's death!

360
00:33:46,786 --> 00:33:49,026
You'll soon end up like her, you little whore!

361
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:51,526
You'll pay for that!

362
00:35:15,086 --> 00:35:16,416
She's going to paralyze you!

363
00:35:23,306 --> 00:35:24,386
May!

364
00:35:33,768 --> 00:35:35,148
Tsai, you filthy mongrel!

365
00:35:37,778 --> 00:35:39,688
An ambush!

366
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,569
Father, are you all right?

367
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:49,529
Wudan should have gotten rid of you long ago.

368
00:35:50,169 --> 00:35:52,159
It's been a long time, Jade Fox!

369
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,200
You don't remember me...

370
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,380
But you should remember my master.

371
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:01,711
You infiltrated Wudan while I was away.

372
00:36:01,891 --> 00:36:04,131
You stole our secret manual

373
00:36:04,311 --> 00:36:06,341
and poisoned our master!

374
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:09,431
Now it's time for you to pay!

375
00:36:10,192 --> 00:36:12,642
Your master underestimated us women.

376
00:36:12,812 --> 00:36:15,812
Sure, he'd sleep with me, but he would never teach me.

377
00:36:16,022 --> 00:36:18,782
He deserved to die by a woman's hand!

378
00:36:59,947 --> 00:37:02,697
You stole the secrets of Wudan's highest martial arts.

379
00:37:02,868 --> 00:37:05,828
But after ten years of training your moves are still undisciplined.

380
00:37:05,998 --> 00:37:07,458
And today,

381
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:10,328
under a Wudan sword...

382
00:37:10,499 --> 00:37:11,199
you will die!

383
00:37:17,799 --> 00:37:19,879
Disciple, we'll kill them all!

384
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,050
Let's go!

385
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,850
Another one!

386
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,350
I must get rid of Tsai!

387
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:32,721
Who are you?

388
00:37:35,111 --> 00:37:37,101
Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?

389
00:37:39,242 --> 00:37:40,322
What's it to you?

390
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:42,032
My name is Li Mu Bai.

391
00:37:42,452 --> 00:37:44,612
The Green Destiny is mine.

392
00:37:55,174 --> 00:37:57,414
Jade Fox can't be your master.

393
00:37:57,594 --> 00:37:59,504
Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?

394
00:37:59,684 --> 00:38:00,514
I'm just playing around.

395
00:38:07,435 --> 00:38:09,095
Tell me, who is your master?

396
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,378
Let's go! We must kill them!

397
00:38:41,849 --> 00:38:42,799
Father!

398
00:39:05,292 --> 00:39:07,172
This is Tsai?

399
00:39:08,752 --> 00:39:10,172
My father.

400
00:39:10,342 --> 00:39:12,882
Police inspector from Shaan.

401
00:39:13,973 --> 00:39:18,633
This should be reported to Governor Yu.

402
00:39:18,813 --> 00:39:20,963
The victim is an officer.

403
00:39:21,143 --> 00:39:23,713
You believe the killer is hiding out in his compound?

404
00:39:25,854 --> 00:39:27,604
I'd bet my life on it!

405
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:33,775
Come with me.

406
00:39:35,615 --> 00:39:39,155
This needs to be resolved, and quickly.

407
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:43,575
I'll get into the Yu household and get her.

408
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,546
I'll ferret out Fox and her gang.

409
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,956
We must be careful.

410
00:39:47,126 --> 00:39:50,546
Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.

411
00:39:50,717 --> 00:39:53,807
Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.

412
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:55,717
It might get Sir Te in trouble.

413
00:39:57,557 --> 00:39:59,057
This is a delicate matter.

414
00:39:59,558 --> 00:40:02,398
Sir Te, can you find some excuse

415
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:05,478
to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?

416
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:08,739
What do you have in mind?

417
00:40:09,989 --> 00:40:13,489
The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs.

418
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,500
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.

419
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:25,340
She's being so considerate.

420
00:40:25,721 --> 00:40:28,421
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.

421
00:40:28,591 --> 00:40:31,381
I heard Sir Te lost something.

422
00:40:31,551 --> 00:40:34,761
And now Madam Te's not feeling well...

423
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:38,302
We know who stole the missing item.

424
00:40:40,442 --> 00:40:45,402
If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue

425
00:40:45,573 --> 00:40:47,483
the matter no further.

426
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:48,933
That's good.

427
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:52,203
Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves.

428
00:40:52,374 --> 00:40:53,944
It's very embarrassing.

429
00:40:54,164 --> 00:40:58,114
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes...

430
00:40:58,294 --> 00:41:01,454
that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.

431
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:05,795
But don't be too lenient.

432
00:41:05,965 --> 00:41:09,055
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer

433
00:41:09,226 --> 00:41:10,676
who turned up in Peking.

434
00:41:11,686 --> 00:41:13,676
A murderer?

435
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:14,716
Yes,

436
00:41:14,896 --> 00:41:18,976
the very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.

437
00:41:19,147 --> 00:41:19,977
Last night,

438
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:22,897
she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.

439
00:41:23,067 --> 00:41:25,907
A female criminal! Now that's news!

440
00:41:26,077 --> 00:41:29,107
You say she killed a policeman?

441
00:41:29,538 --> 00:41:30,908
Yes, from the West.

442
00:41:31,078 --> 00:41:34,658
He went undercover, and followed her here.

443
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:36,619
Maybe the murderer

444
00:41:36,789 --> 00:41:39,369
and the thief are the same.

445
00:41:39,549 --> 00:41:40,459
I doubt that.

446
00:41:41,589 --> 00:41:42,169
This thief...

447
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,750
is very unusual.

448
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,170
And most likely smarter than a mere killer.

449
00:42:01,361 --> 00:42:02,471
Greetings, Sir Te.

450
00:42:03,952 --> 00:42:05,272
Hello, Madam Yu.

451
00:42:05,452 --> 00:42:06,612
This is Li Mu Bai,

452
00:42:06,782 --> 00:42:09,242
the renowned swordsman.

453
00:42:09,412 --> 00:42:10,992
Delighted to meet you.

454
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,873
Miss Yu is soon to be married.

455
00:42:17,463 --> 00:42:19,533
Congratulations.

456
00:42:33,225 --> 00:42:35,355
Why don't you come in?

457
00:42:35,525 --> 00:42:37,145
I'm standing guard.

458
00:42:37,486 --> 00:42:40,026
Come in. It's cold.

459
00:42:45,787 --> 00:42:47,027
Come in.

460
00:42:47,207 --> 00:42:50,207
We don't have to fear Jade Fox if we're together.

461
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,980
Isn't it a bit late to be out?

462
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,990
You've brought me the sword?

463
00:43:22,031 --> 00:43:24,191
I do as I please.

464
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:28,621
Where is your master?

465
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:29,951
What's it to you?

466
00:43:56,565 --> 00:43:58,275
Had enough flying?

467
00:44:02,115 --> 00:44:03,195
You've got potential.

468
00:44:03,365 --> 00:44:07,615
You've studied the Wudan manual but you don't understand it.

469
00:44:10,456 --> 00:44:13,126
You need a real master.

470
00:44:13,466 --> 00:44:15,666
Do you think you are a real master?

471
00:44:15,837 --> 00:44:19,627
Like most things, I am nothing.

472
00:44:19,807 --> 00:44:21,677
It's the same for this sword.

473
00:44:21,847 --> 00:44:24,257
All of it is simply a state of mind.

474
00:44:25,098 --> 00:44:27,138
Stop talking like a monk!

475
00:44:27,308 --> 00:44:28,258
Just fight!

476
00:44:28,438 --> 00:44:30,148
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.

477
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:30,978
On guard!

478
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,620
Real sharpness comes without effort.

479
00:45:05,892 --> 00:45:06,972
No growth.

480
00:45:07,193 --> 00:45:08,303
Without assistance.

481
00:45:09,103 --> 00:45:10,223
No action.

482
00:45:10,773 --> 00:45:11,853
Without reaction.

483
00:45:12,403 --> 00:45:13,943
No desire without restraint.

484
00:45:14,193 --> 00:45:16,733
Now give yourself up and find yourself again.

485
00:45:18,244 --> 00:45:20,614
There is a lesson for you.

486
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:26,875
Go ahead.

487
00:45:29,005 --> 00:45:29,755
Why should I?

488
00:45:29,925 --> 00:45:34,045
You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny,

489
00:45:34,216 --> 00:45:37,136
but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.

490
00:45:39,686 --> 00:45:41,506
Why do you want to teach me?

491
00:45:43,147 --> 00:45:45,057
I've always wanted a disciple

492
00:45:45,227 --> 00:45:48,727
worthy of Wudan's secrets.

493
00:45:50,357 --> 00:45:52,517
And if I use them to kill you?

494
00:45:53,118 --> 00:45:56,198
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

495
00:45:56,368 --> 00:46:00,368
Deep down, you're good. Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.

496
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:04,459
Wudan is a whorehouse!

497
00:46:04,629 --> 00:46:05,739
Keep your lessons!

498
00:46:24,731 --> 00:46:26,191
You're home late...

499
00:46:26,361 --> 00:46:27,771
or should I say early?

500
00:46:30,652 --> 00:46:32,892
Why are you still here? You killed a policeman.

501
00:46:33,412 --> 00:46:34,822
You should leave!

502
00:46:35,783 --> 00:46:38,493
You'll bring ruin on my whole family.

503
00:46:38,663 --> 00:46:41,953
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.

504
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:45,873
Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?

505
00:46:46,754 --> 00:46:49,674
You, too, are responsible for that death. Come with me.

506
00:46:50,924 --> 00:46:54,924
You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.

507
00:46:56,015 --> 00:46:57,925
Denied your talent...

508
00:46:58,105 --> 00:47:00,155
As master and disciple we will rule.

509
00:47:00,325 --> 00:47:01,445
I'll never live as a thief!

510
00:47:01,626 --> 00:47:03,366
You're already a thief.

511
00:47:03,536 --> 00:47:04,826
That was just for fun.

512
00:47:04,996 --> 00:47:06,996
How can I leave? Where would I go?

513
00:47:08,126 --> 00:47:09,666
Wherever we want.

514
00:47:09,836 --> 00:47:11,626
We'll get rid of anyone in our way.

515
00:47:11,797 --> 00:47:12,717
Even your father.

516
00:47:12,887 --> 00:47:13,997
Shut up!

517
00:47:14,177 --> 00:47:18,087
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed.

518
00:47:18,267 --> 00:47:20,007
Exciting, isn't it?

519
00:47:25,778 --> 00:47:27,728
I owe you nothing.

520
00:47:27,898 --> 00:47:29,978
Yes, you do!

521
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:34,529
You are still my disciple.

522
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,130
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual?

523
00:47:46,881 --> 00:47:49,201
You couldn't even decipher the symbols!

524
00:47:51,091 --> 00:47:53,761
I studied the diagrams.

525
00:47:53,931 --> 00:47:55,881
But you hid the details!

526
00:47:56,052 --> 00:47:59,672
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.

527
00:48:00,102 --> 00:48:01,352
You know...

528
00:48:01,982 --> 00:48:04,812
you've gone as far as you can go.

529
00:48:05,403 --> 00:48:08,183
I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.

530
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:13,653
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai,

531
00:48:14,244 --> 00:48:17,494
I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.

532
00:48:20,454 --> 00:48:21,864
Master...

533
00:48:23,465 --> 00:48:26,665
I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.

534
00:48:27,465 --> 00:48:29,955
You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.

535
00:48:30,596 --> 00:48:34,466
But once I realized I could surpass you,

536
00:48:34,636 --> 00:48:36,266
I became so frightened!

537
00:48:37,896 --> 00:48:39,886
Everything fell apart.

538
00:48:40,067 --> 00:48:42,217
I had no one to guide me,

539
00:48:43,437 --> 00:48:45,437
no one to learn from.

540
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:49,357
Believe me,

541
00:48:49,528 --> 00:48:51,608
I've a lesson or two left to teach you!

542
00:50:03,696 --> 00:50:04,646
The sword is back...

543
00:50:05,276 --> 00:50:06,906
Are you happy?

544
00:50:08,117 --> 00:50:10,027
I admit...

545
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:12,737
getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.

546
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:15,907
But it's not your sword anymore.

547
00:50:16,088 --> 00:50:18,238
You gave it to Sir Te.

548
00:50:19,798 --> 00:50:20,908
True.

549
00:50:21,758 --> 00:50:25,088
But I must borrow it for one last mission.

550
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:28,289
Jade Fox must die at its edge.

551
00:50:32,809 --> 00:50:36,729
Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?

552
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,310
My job was to get the sword back, without embarrassing anyone.

553
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,240
I wasn't about to ruin

554
00:50:43,401 --> 00:50:45,781
her life, or her father's.

555
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:48,701
You did your job well.

556
00:50:48,871 --> 00:50:51,491
But, this girl...

557
00:50:52,622 --> 00:50:53,902
I saw her last night.

558
00:50:56,502 --> 00:50:58,372
I knew she would intrigue you.

559
00:50:59,092 --> 00:51:00,912
She needs direction...

560
00:51:01,093 --> 00:51:04,173
and training.

561
00:51:04,343 --> 00:51:07,383
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.

562
00:51:07,553 --> 00:51:09,683
In any case, it will all be over soon.

563
00:51:09,854 --> 00:51:13,554
You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.

564
00:51:15,444 --> 00:51:17,144
That's not for her.

565
00:51:17,314 --> 00:51:19,694
She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.

566
00:51:20,825 --> 00:51:22,445
But Wudan does not accept women.

567
00:51:23,245 --> 00:51:25,735
For her, they might make an exception.

568
00:51:25,905 --> 00:51:29,825
If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.

569
00:51:30,456 --> 00:51:33,206
It's not our affair.

570
00:51:33,376 --> 00:51:38,166
Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.

571
00:51:41,427 --> 00:51:43,387
I thought by giving away the sword,

572
00:51:43,557 --> 00:51:45,507
I could escape the Giang Hu world.

573
00:51:46,178 --> 00:51:50,348
But the cycle of bloodshed continues.

574
00:51:51,438 --> 00:51:53,758
I wish there were something more

575
00:51:53,939 --> 00:51:56,149
I could do to help you.

576
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,780
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.

577
00:52:26,562 --> 00:52:27,592
Lo?

578
00:52:28,182 --> 00:52:29,262
Jen!

579
00:52:42,114 --> 00:52:44,024
You shouldn't have come.

580
00:52:46,375 --> 00:52:49,825
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days...

581
00:52:50,005 --> 00:52:51,745
it took me a while to get in here.

582
00:52:51,915 --> 00:52:53,825
I can't wait any longer.

583
00:52:54,005 --> 00:52:56,625
I was wrong to let you go.

584
00:52:57,256 --> 00:52:58,376
Come back with me.

585
00:52:58,556 --> 00:53:00,956
You'll be happy in the desert.

586
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:02,966
You'll be free there.

587
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:08,137
You've been looking for me all this time?

588
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,380
Jen...

589
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:34,170
Stop playing with it.

590
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,760
I won't break it.

591
00:54:05,043 --> 00:54:06,033
It's Dark Cloud!

592
00:54:06,664 --> 00:54:08,664
Dark Cloud is coming!

593
00:54:24,186 --> 00:54:26,646
Lower the shade, don't let them see you!

594
00:54:44,918 --> 00:54:47,038
Don't touch the women!

595
00:55:16,702 --> 00:55:18,202
Let's go!

596
00:55:36,804 --> 00:55:38,004
Come get your comb.

597
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:30,240
Hurry back to your mother.

598
00:57:31,477 --> 00:57:33,187
She's mine!

599
00:57:33,347 --> 00:57:34,347
Leave her to me!

600
00:57:44,868 --> 00:57:46,408
Come and get it!

601
00:57:46,579 --> 00:57:48,369
Give me back my comb!

602
00:57:49,909 --> 00:57:51,369
Let's stop a moment.

603
00:57:51,539 --> 00:57:53,199
Give it back!

604
00:57:53,749 --> 00:57:55,989
You're tired. You need rest.

605
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:05,040
Your horse needs water. There's a creek up here.

606
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:15,012
Well, there used to be!

607
00:58:22,533 --> 00:58:23,483
What's your name?

608
00:58:25,493 --> 00:58:26,693
I'm Lo.

609
00:58:26,863 --> 00:58:28,993
The Hans call me Dark Cloud.

610
00:58:29,163 --> 00:58:30,993
I'm not that tall or big,

611
00:58:31,164 --> 00:58:32,954
but I'm quick as lightning.

612
00:58:45,935 --> 00:58:47,175
My comb!

613
01:00:23,116 --> 01:00:26,116
If you like that arrow, I can make you a bow.

614
01:00:26,287 --> 01:00:28,577
Great for hunting wild chicken.

615
01:00:28,747 --> 01:00:30,457
They're delicious.

616
01:00:35,968 --> 01:00:38,418
You need to eat. Understand?

617
01:00:39,598 --> 01:00:42,548
Then you'll have the strength to fight.

618
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:45,519
Understand?

619
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,400
You're eating too fast.

620
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:58,980
Slowly.

621
01:03:04,675 --> 01:03:06,165
You've got quite a temper.

622
01:03:06,335 --> 01:03:08,295
It's better this way...

623
01:03:14,846 --> 01:03:16,306
You coward!

624
01:03:19,186 --> 01:03:21,226
Still in a bad mood?

625
01:03:21,396 --> 01:03:23,476
At least you're speaking.

626
01:03:24,027 --> 01:03:25,227
What's your name?

627
01:03:28,027 --> 01:03:30,357
I didn't think the Hans had names like that.

628
01:04:09,242 --> 01:04:09,992
Relax.

629
01:04:10,622 --> 01:04:13,652
If I had wanted to, I would already have done it.

630
01:04:14,792 --> 01:04:17,162
You must be dying for a bath.

631
01:04:17,623 --> 01:04:20,493
Fresh water's hard to get here.

632
01:04:21,133 --> 01:04:23,413
But I managed to bring some up.

633
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:26,083
You can wear my clothes when you're done.

634
01:04:26,714 --> 01:04:28,264
They're clean.

635
01:04:44,196 --> 01:04:45,526
Don't worry.

636
01:04:48,196 --> 01:04:51,946
I'll sing, so you'll know where I am.

637
01:04:52,957 --> 01:04:55,247
After the bath, you'll be calmer.

638
01:04:57,457 --> 01:04:59,037
No more hitting on the head!

639
01:06:11,956 --> 01:06:14,246
All this trouble for a comb?

640
01:06:15,296 --> 01:06:16,756
It's mine.

641
01:06:17,876 --> 01:06:20,966
It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.

642
01:06:22,387 --> 01:06:25,337
Not true. I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.

643
01:06:26,937 --> 01:06:28,977
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.

644
01:06:32,148 --> 01:06:33,308
I'm sorry...

645
01:06:33,688 --> 01:06:34,968
I guessed wrong.

646
01:06:35,148 --> 01:06:36,888
I thought you were a Han.

647
01:06:39,239 --> 01:06:41,199
Give me back my comb.

648
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,359
I don't take orders from anyone.

649
01:06:54,291 --> 01:06:55,291
Give it back.

650
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,380
One night...

651
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:20,180
when I was a boy, I saw a thousand shooting stars.

652
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:24,220
I thought, "Where did they all go?"

653
01:08:24,691 --> 01:08:28,731
I'm an orphan. I used to look for stars alone.

654
01:08:29,771 --> 01:08:34,851
I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.

655
01:08:35,652 --> 01:08:38,692
I've been riding in the desert ever since.

656
01:08:40,242 --> 01:08:42,732
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.

657
01:08:42,913 --> 01:08:46,003
He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.

658
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:51,073
Out here, you always fight for survival.

659
01:08:51,254 --> 01:08:54,924
You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.

660
01:08:55,094 --> 01:08:58,294
Slowly, your gang becomes your family.

661
01:08:59,185 --> 01:09:02,345
All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people

662
01:09:02,515 --> 01:09:04,765
and make my life easier.

663
01:09:05,605 --> 01:09:08,145
So you are still that little boy

664
01:09:08,316 --> 01:09:10,606
looking for shooting stars.

665
01:09:11,906 --> 01:09:13,726
I am a man.

666
01:09:14,406 --> 01:09:18,406
And now I've found the brightest star of all.

667
01:09:40,639 --> 01:09:42,549
Your father's men are looking for you.

668
01:10:13,593 --> 01:10:15,503
They're still out there, circling closer.

669
01:10:18,224 --> 01:10:19,884
Let them look.

670
01:10:21,184 --> 01:10:23,434
It is trouble for me.

671
01:10:26,274 --> 01:10:27,904
Don't send me back.

672
01:10:30,945 --> 01:10:32,525
You must decide.

673
01:10:32,705 --> 01:10:35,575
You might get tired of this life.

674
01:10:37,626 --> 01:10:40,406
You might begin to miss your family.

675
01:10:40,916 --> 01:10:44,206
If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.

676
01:10:44,377 --> 01:10:46,667
She would miss us.

677
01:10:51,807 --> 01:10:52,797
Jen...

678
01:10:54,478 --> 01:10:56,348
I want you to be mine forever.

679
01:10:57,438 --> 01:10:59,018
I will make my mark on the world.

680
01:10:59,188 --> 01:11:01,648
I will earn your parents respect.

681
01:11:02,729 --> 01:11:04,389
We have a legend.

682
01:11:04,569 --> 01:11:06,939
Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain,

683
01:11:07,109 --> 01:11:09,239
God will grant his wish.

684
01:11:09,739 --> 01:11:14,569
Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.

685
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:16,290
He didn't die.

686
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:18,580
He wasn't even hurt.

687
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,710
He floated away, far away, never to return.

688
01:11:23,671 --> 01:11:26,291
He knew his wish had come true.

689
01:11:27,171 --> 01:11:29,461
If you believe, it will happen.

690
01:11:30,342 --> 01:11:32,382
The elders say,

691
01:11:32,852 --> 01:11:35,472
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true".

692
01:11:46,614 --> 01:11:48,234
Keep it safe.

693
01:11:49,364 --> 01:11:52,324
Return it to me when we are together again.

694
01:11:54,624 --> 01:11:55,734
I will.

695
01:12:03,425 --> 01:12:07,005
If you don't, I'll come after you.

696
01:12:07,716 --> 01:12:10,556
And I won't let you off so easy.

697
01:12:22,448 --> 01:12:25,858
Wherever I went someone always recognized me.

698
01:12:26,528 --> 01:12:28,438
I really tried.

699
01:12:31,659 --> 01:12:33,569
Later, I heard you came to Peking.

700
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:36,079
I was afraid I'd never see you again.

701
01:12:36,499 --> 01:12:38,379
So I came.

702
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:41,000
I can't let you marry.

703
01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:46,250
Go.

704
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:48,420
Jen...

705
01:12:51,311 --> 01:12:53,271
Don't ever come back.

706
01:12:53,441 --> 01:12:55,011
So it's over?

707
01:12:56,612 --> 01:12:57,552
Yes.

708
01:13:13,373 --> 01:13:15,613
We heard noises.

709
01:13:15,794 --> 01:13:17,424
It was just a cat.

710
01:13:35,106 --> 01:13:37,346
You think Jade Fox will show up?

711
01:13:37,526 --> 01:13:39,436
She's out there,

712
01:13:40,026 --> 01:13:42,866
but I doubt she'll show herself.

713
01:13:43,037 --> 01:13:44,577
We'll keep our eyes open.

714
01:13:44,747 --> 01:13:45,577
Sooner or later,

715
01:13:45,957 --> 01:13:48,957
she'll come for the girl.

716
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:08,630
Jen!

717
01:14:18,321 --> 01:14:19,521
Come with me!

718
01:14:34,343 --> 01:14:37,463
You're mine! Come with me to the desert!

719
01:14:50,694 --> 01:14:51,474
Jen!

720
01:14:51,895 --> 01:14:54,105
Come with me to Xin Jiang!

721
01:14:59,575 --> 01:15:00,235
Tell me.

722
01:15:00,406 --> 01:15:01,686
Where is Jade Fox?

723
01:15:01,866 --> 01:15:03,576
Come with me. Hurry!

724
01:15:07,206 --> 01:15:10,046
You thought she'd give it all up and go back West with you?

725
01:15:12,467 --> 01:15:13,837
She's mine.

726
01:15:14,007 --> 01:15:15,287
Either way,

727
01:15:15,467 --> 01:15:19,087
you are no good to her dead. With the Gou and Yu clans

728
01:15:19,258 --> 01:15:22,098
hunting you, you'll soon be in their hands.

729
01:15:22,428 --> 01:15:23,758
I don't care anymore.

730
01:15:26,268 --> 01:15:29,058
If you truly loved her, you wouldn't say that.

731
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:34,189
Don't you want to see her again?

732
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:37,570
All right.

733
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:40,200
I'll write you an introduction. Take it to Wudan.

734
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:42,280
Wait there for news from me.

735
01:15:44,911 --> 01:15:45,861
All right.

736
01:15:54,382 --> 01:15:57,052
When will this end?

737
01:15:57,222 --> 01:16:00,092
They take it, they put it back, they take it again.

738
01:16:00,262 --> 01:16:04,262
My home is turning into a warehouse.

739
01:16:04,433 --> 01:16:05,353
Come in.

740
01:16:07,523 --> 01:16:08,433
Speak!

741
01:16:08,603 --> 01:16:09,983
Jen has run away!

742
01:16:10,153 --> 01:16:12,473
Gou found the wedding chamber empty.

743
01:16:12,654 --> 01:16:15,404
Governor Yu requests your assistance.

744
01:16:15,574 --> 01:16:17,194
You know the Giang Hu underworld.

745
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:21,114
He wants to find her, and keep her from harm.

746
01:16:22,455 --> 01:16:26,075
Sir Te, leave this to us. Don't worry.

747
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:46,017
What can I serve you?

748
01:16:48,398 --> 01:16:49,598
This cup is dirty.

749
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:05,660
Hello.

750
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:09,750
What's your name?

751
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:11,960
Long.

752
01:17:13,801 --> 01:17:15,631
It's young Master Long.

753
01:17:15,801 --> 01:17:16,971
My apologies!

754
01:17:17,141 --> 01:17:19,981
I'm Iron Eagle Sung

755
01:17:20,141 --> 01:17:21,681
and this is my brother in arms,

756
01:17:21,852 --> 01:17:23,602
Flying Cougar Li Yun.

757
01:17:23,772 --> 01:17:25,182
What brings you to Huai An,

758
01:17:25,362 --> 01:17:27,732
and where are you headed, Master Long?

759
01:17:28,822 --> 01:17:30,282
Anywhere there's action.

760
01:17:31,403 --> 01:17:35,023
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.

761
01:17:36,323 --> 01:17:37,903
Don't bother.

762
01:17:39,544 --> 01:17:42,074
You don't seem to understand.

763
01:17:44,084 --> 01:17:45,584
So what if I don't?

764
01:17:47,214 --> 01:17:50,634
We have ways of helping you to understand.

765
01:17:59,356 --> 01:18:02,186
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?

766
01:18:04,606 --> 01:18:06,356
He is my defeated foe!

767
01:18:25,379 --> 01:18:27,009
Have some tea.

768
01:18:56,122 --> 01:18:57,402
Shu Lien...

769
01:18:58,042 --> 01:19:00,992
The things we touch have no permanence.

770
01:19:03,093 --> 01:19:04,963
My master would say...

771
01:19:05,133 --> 01:19:08,503
there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.

772
01:19:09,684 --> 01:19:13,634
Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.

773
01:19:15,224 --> 01:19:18,344
Not everything is an illusion.

774
01:19:18,525 --> 01:19:20,265
My hand...

775
01:19:20,445 --> 01:19:22,685
wasn't that real?

776
01:19:24,655 --> 01:19:29,115
Your hand, rough and callused from practice...

777
01:19:29,286 --> 01:19:32,406
All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it.

778
01:19:35,957 --> 01:19:40,707
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons,

779
01:19:40,877 --> 01:19:45,047
full of corruption...

780
01:19:46,298 --> 01:19:49,008
I tried sincerely to give it up

781
01:19:49,178 --> 01:19:51,418
but I have brought us only trouble.

782
01:19:51,598 --> 01:19:54,178
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.

783
01:19:54,769 --> 01:19:57,729
You're right, but I don't know what to do.

784
01:19:57,899 --> 01:20:00,109
I want to be with you...

785
01:20:02,490 --> 01:20:04,150
just like this.

786
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,820
It gives me a sense of peace.

787
01:20:26,512 --> 01:20:27,842
Please follow me.

788
01:20:30,393 --> 01:20:33,183
I want a clean room. We have plenty.

789
01:20:35,813 --> 01:20:36,973
Your order?

790
01:20:37,154 --> 01:20:38,694
Steamed whole cod, bite-size meatballs,

791
01:20:38,864 --> 01:20:41,354
a little starchy, but keep the sauce light,

792
01:20:41,534 --> 01:20:44,654
shark fin soup, mixed vegetables, and some warm wine.

793
01:20:45,535 --> 01:20:47,945
I have to order from a bigger restaurant.

794
01:20:48,125 --> 01:20:49,195
Hurry then.

795
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:33,660
That's him.

796
01:21:42,681 --> 01:21:45,801
I am Iron Arm Mi.

797
01:21:46,772 --> 01:21:50,142
I heard a true master has arrived. I have come to seek a lesson.

798
01:22:03,573 --> 01:22:04,993
You asked for it!

799
01:22:25,436 --> 01:22:27,176
What kind of Iron Arm are you?

800
01:22:42,748 --> 01:22:44,238
You have amazing technique!

801
01:22:44,418 --> 01:22:46,738
I am Flying Saber.

802
01:22:46,918 --> 01:22:49,918
Are you related to Southern Crane?

803
01:22:50,089 --> 01:22:53,169
Southern Duck? I don't eat anything with two feet.

804
01:22:53,339 --> 01:22:55,549
Who could remember such long-winded names?

805
01:22:57,430 --> 01:22:59,090
Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe,

806
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:02,020
and you don't know his master Southern Crane?

807
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:04,390
Who are you?

808
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:09,480
I'm Shining Phoenix Mountain Gou.

809
01:23:11,071 --> 01:23:12,271
Gou?

810
01:23:12,861 --> 01:23:14,571
I hate that name.

811
01:23:14,741 --> 01:23:16,281
It makes me puke!

812
01:23:16,952 --> 01:23:19,522
Too bad you're named Gou.

813
01:23:19,992 --> 01:23:21,982
You'll be the first to feel my sword today.

814
01:23:43,605 --> 01:23:44,555
Hold it!

815
01:23:45,525 --> 01:23:48,195
Don't you know Monk Jing?

816
01:23:48,355 --> 01:23:50,935
A monk, in a place like this? You need a lesson!

817
01:23:51,116 --> 01:23:52,776
Who are you?

818
01:23:53,906 --> 01:23:55,146
Who am I?

819
01:23:55,576 --> 01:23:56,566
I am...

820
01:24:00,667 --> 01:24:04,327
I am the Invincible Sword Goddess.

821
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:07,877
Armed with the incredible...

822
01:24:08,047 --> 01:24:09,537
Green Destiny.

823
01:24:15,758 --> 01:24:18,048
Be you Li or Southern Crane...

824
01:24:19,639 --> 01:24:21,269
lower your head...

825
01:24:21,439 --> 01:24:22,639
and ask for mercy.

826
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:32,320
I am the desert dragon.

827
01:24:41,251 --> 01:24:43,871
I leave no trace.

828
01:24:54,393 --> 01:24:57,643
Today I fly over Eu-Mei.

829
01:24:59,773 --> 01:25:00,933
Tomorrow...

830
01:25:01,234 --> 01:25:04,644
I'll kick over Wudan Mountain!

831
01:25:18,876 --> 01:25:21,906
We politely asked for a friendly match,

832
01:25:22,086 --> 01:25:24,326
but she showed no respect, and attacked us.

833
01:25:24,506 --> 01:25:28,036
Everyone came by to teach her a lesson.

834
01:25:28,217 --> 01:25:30,457
Her sword was just too powerful.

835
01:25:30,637 --> 01:25:31,877
I've traveled everywhere,

836
01:25:32,057 --> 01:25:34,097
but never met anyone so uncivilized.

837
01:25:34,267 --> 01:25:38,477
She kept accusing me of being Gou Jun Pei's brother.

838
01:25:38,648 --> 01:25:41,598
Who is this Gou, anyway?

839
01:25:43,188 --> 01:25:44,358
Her husband.

840
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,030
We're close to your headquarters.

841
01:25:59,210 --> 01:26:00,580
Go home and check in.

842
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:02,000
What about you?

843
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:04,460
I'll look around and catch up later.

844
01:26:04,631 --> 01:26:05,501
Not a bad idea.

845
01:26:05,671 --> 01:26:09,591
Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.

846
01:26:35,954 --> 01:26:37,284
Mistress, you're back.

847
01:26:43,085 --> 01:26:44,505
It's you!

848
01:26:45,595 --> 01:26:47,055
How is everything here?

849
01:26:47,216 --> 01:26:48,006
Fine.

850
01:26:48,176 --> 01:26:49,836
You've been gone a while.

851
01:26:50,016 --> 01:26:51,476
Yes, and I leave again tomorrow.

852
01:26:51,636 --> 01:26:53,636
Your wife was due? Yeah, a baby girl.

853
01:26:53,806 --> 01:26:54,556
Good!

854
01:26:54,726 --> 01:26:57,476
I'll be happy if she's half as strong as you.

855
01:26:58,187 --> 01:26:59,267
Mrs. Wu...

856
01:27:00,027 --> 01:27:01,307
You're back!

857
01:27:01,487 --> 01:27:03,777
How's the arm? Still sore? Much better.

858
01:27:04,868 --> 01:27:07,698
You've been gone so long.

859
01:27:08,908 --> 01:27:11,068
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.

860
01:27:12,288 --> 01:27:14,198
I'll go and make up his room!

861
01:27:44,402 --> 01:27:45,732
Sister Shu Lien...

862
01:27:52,413 --> 01:27:55,083
Here you must be in proper attire.

863
01:27:55,963 --> 01:27:59,793
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes. I'm not staying.

864
01:28:01,094 --> 01:28:04,174
I'll give them to you.

865
01:28:05,724 --> 01:28:08,594
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.

866
01:28:10,765 --> 01:28:11,715
You, sister...

867
01:28:16,316 --> 01:28:17,856
Look at the trouble you've caused.

868
01:28:18,026 --> 01:28:20,776
Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.

869
01:28:20,946 --> 01:28:23,656
If you think of me as your sister,

870
01:28:24,076 --> 01:28:27,406
let me give you some sisterly advice.

871
01:28:27,577 --> 01:28:30,667
You can run from marriage, but not your parents.

872
01:28:31,747 --> 01:28:33,327
They forced me to marry!

873
01:28:34,588 --> 01:28:37,378
Go back to them first.

874
01:28:37,548 --> 01:28:39,538
Then you can decide about Lo.

875
01:28:40,548 --> 01:28:41,628
You know about Lo?

876
01:28:50,439 --> 01:28:53,639
He really loves you.

877
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:58,400
Come back to Peking with me. We'll find a solution.

878
01:29:02,571 --> 01:29:03,901
Where is he now?

879
01:29:04,331 --> 01:29:05,951
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements.

880
01:29:09,912 --> 01:29:11,912
He sent him to Wudan Mountain.

881
01:29:12,922 --> 01:29:15,542
You're working together to set me up! I'm leaving!

882
01:29:15,922 --> 01:29:18,252
How dare you accuse us!

883
01:29:18,423 --> 01:29:20,713
I always knew you had stolen the sword!

884
01:29:20,883 --> 01:29:23,343
I've done nothing but protect you and your family.

885
01:29:23,513 --> 01:29:25,803
And you've repaid me with nothing but contempt.

886
01:29:26,013 --> 01:29:28,973
Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.

887
01:29:29,144 --> 01:29:32,314
We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all!

888
01:29:32,484 --> 01:29:34,354
You're no sister of mine!

889
01:29:36,945 --> 01:29:38,225
What do I care?

890
01:29:39,155 --> 01:29:41,445
You were never a real friend anyway.

891
01:29:41,825 --> 01:29:43,535
But I wonder...

892
01:29:43,705 --> 01:29:45,775
how long could you last as my enemy?

893
01:29:48,336 --> 01:29:49,326
Put the sword down!

894
01:30:00,807 --> 01:30:01,587
Jen!

895
01:30:05,268 --> 01:30:07,478
Everyone out. Shut the doors.

896
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:21,069
Fine... the friendship is over.

897
01:33:35,002 --> 01:33:36,112
Don't touch it!

898
01:33:36,792 --> 01:33:38,372
That's Li Mu Bai's sword.

899
01:33:39,922 --> 01:33:41,742
Come and get it if you can.

900
01:33:42,753 --> 01:33:44,583
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.

901
01:33:46,473 --> 01:33:48,373
Don't be a sore loser.

902
01:33:52,854 --> 01:33:55,094
Go ahead. Take your pick.

903
01:33:55,854 --> 01:33:56,844
I'll wait.

904
01:33:59,564 --> 01:34:00,644
Go ahead.

905
01:34:55,671 --> 01:34:57,041
Give me the sword.

906
01:34:59,551 --> 01:35:00,161
Take it!

907
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:06,132
Stop it!

908
01:35:09,932 --> 01:35:11,762
You don't deserve the Green Destiny.

909
01:35:11,933 --> 01:35:13,433
Not another lecture!

910
01:35:13,603 --> 01:35:14,433
On guard!

911
01:35:16,693 --> 01:35:17,643
Let's end this here.

912
01:35:18,023 --> 01:35:19,813
Only the sword will settle this.

913
01:35:56,108 --> 01:36:00,238
I only let you go because I wanted to see the real you.

914
01:36:06,499 --> 01:36:09,369
What do you know about a true heart?

915
01:37:51,281 --> 01:37:52,601
What do you want?

916
01:37:53,071 --> 01:37:55,311
What I've always wanted, to teach you.

917
01:38:28,815 --> 01:38:29,845
All right.

918
01:38:30,525 --> 01:38:33,105
If you can take back the sword in three moves,

919
01:38:33,285 --> 01:38:34,695
I'll go with you.

920
01:38:39,456 --> 01:38:40,156
Give it back!

921
01:38:40,326 --> 01:38:42,286
Kneel! Never!

922
01:38:42,456 --> 01:38:44,826
Then you have no use for the sword.

923
01:39:59,205 --> 01:40:02,165
Sooner or later they'd drag you back to Peking.

924
01:40:02,966 --> 01:40:06,326
Your parents will never accept you again.

925
01:40:09,806 --> 01:40:10,886
But why go home?

926
01:40:11,807 --> 01:40:14,837
We've gone this far, we won't stop now.

927
01:40:15,017 --> 01:40:17,427
You'll always be my Lady.

928
01:40:20,228 --> 01:40:23,068
At last, we'll be our own masters.

929
01:40:24,148 --> 01:40:27,358
We'll be happy. That's the most important thing.

930
01:40:27,528 --> 01:40:29,898
All we have left is each other, right?

931
01:40:35,249 --> 01:40:36,739
Lie down and rest.

932
01:41:00,112 --> 01:41:02,772
She's crazy. You should have killed her.

933
01:41:02,942 --> 01:41:04,812
I didn't have the heart.

934
01:41:05,323 --> 01:41:07,863
Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.

935
01:42:18,611 --> 01:42:20,981
Is it me or the sword you want?

936
01:42:41,053 --> 01:42:42,793
You've been drugged.

937
01:43:00,906 --> 01:43:02,646
Where is Jade Fox?

938
01:43:45,241 --> 01:43:46,361
What happened?

939
01:43:47,621 --> 01:43:50,161
Jade Fox drugged her.

940
01:43:50,331 --> 01:43:51,791
How did you get here?

941
01:43:54,212 --> 01:43:56,502
We followed Jade Fox.

942
01:44:26,495 --> 01:44:28,905
And so you die.

943
01:44:30,546 --> 01:44:32,206
And so shall you!

944
01:44:40,677 --> 01:44:42,337
A poisoned needle!

945
01:44:46,308 --> 01:44:48,518
You deserve to die,

946
01:44:49,648 --> 01:44:51,858
but the life I was hoping to take...

947
01:44:52,198 --> 01:44:54,518
was Jen's.

948
01:44:56,159 --> 01:44:58,399
Ten years I devoted to you.

949
01:44:58,779 --> 01:45:00,279
But you deceived me!

950
01:45:02,249 --> 01:45:04,119
You hid the manual's true meaning.

951
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:06,120
I never improved...

952
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:11,460
but your progress was limitless!

953
01:45:12,841 --> 01:45:14,301
You know what poison is?

954
01:45:15,591 --> 01:45:16,921
An eight-year-old girl,

955
01:45:17,091 --> 01:45:20,211
full of deceit. That's poison!

956
01:45:24,522 --> 01:45:25,602
Jen!

957
01:45:27,562 --> 01:45:29,522
My only family...

958
01:45:30,323 --> 01:45:32,643
my only enemy...

959
01:45:41,454 --> 01:45:42,614
You can't die!

960
01:45:42,794 --> 01:45:45,114
Tell us what poison you used!

961
01:45:47,085 --> 01:45:48,495
You can't die!

962
01:45:48,675 --> 01:45:49,755
Tell us the antidote!

963
01:45:49,925 --> 01:45:52,625
You can't let Li Mu Bai die!

964
01:45:52,805 --> 01:45:54,595
She used Purple Yin...

965
01:45:56,136 --> 01:45:57,676
Purple Yin poison.

966
01:45:57,846 --> 01:45:59,476
It goes straight to the heart.

967
01:46:02,226 --> 01:46:06,016
It's the same poison she used to kill my master.

968
01:46:07,647 --> 01:46:11,107
My blood will soon reverse its flow.

969
01:46:12,157 --> 01:46:13,867
There is no antidote.

970
01:46:14,658 --> 01:46:18,158
That can't be! Everything has an antithesis!

971
01:46:18,328 --> 01:46:20,448
Why not this?

972
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:21,908
The antidote exists.

973
01:46:22,379 --> 01:46:24,579
She taught it to me.

974
01:46:24,999 --> 01:46:27,329
The formula is simple,

975
01:46:27,509 --> 01:46:29,659
but it takes time to prepare.

976
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:36,590
Trust me.

977
01:46:37,930 --> 01:46:39,760
As you have helped me,

978
01:46:39,930 --> 01:46:41,760
let me help him.

979
01:46:43,691 --> 01:46:44,601
All right.

980
01:46:44,771 --> 01:46:48,521
Hurry. I will hold on as long as I can.

981
01:46:48,691 --> 01:46:51,071
Take my horse and go to the compound.

982
01:46:51,242 --> 01:46:54,022
Give this to Mrs. Wu. She'll help you. Hurry!

983
01:46:54,202 --> 01:46:57,152
Spare your energy. I'll be back!

984
01:47:27,196 --> 01:47:28,276
Where is Mrs. Wu?

985
01:47:30,026 --> 01:47:30,976
Stop it!

986
01:47:32,656 --> 01:47:35,406
Shu Lien told me to show you this.

987
01:47:36,457 --> 01:47:37,917
Let her in.

988
01:47:52,019 --> 01:47:54,639
Mu Bai, hold on.

989
01:47:58,849 --> 01:48:00,729
Give me some hope.

990
01:48:25,552 --> 01:48:26,662
Shu Lien...

991
01:48:28,433 --> 01:48:30,133
Save your strength.

992
01:48:32,603 --> 01:48:35,053
My life is departing.

993
01:48:36,274 --> 01:48:38,434
I've only one breath left.

994
01:48:40,944 --> 01:48:43,354
Use it to meditate.

995
01:48:44,025 --> 01:48:46,485
Free yourself from this world

996
01:48:46,655 --> 01:48:49,145
as you have been taught.

997
01:48:50,115 --> 01:48:51,745
Let your soul rise to eternity

998
01:48:51,915 --> 01:48:54,695
with your last breath.

999
01:48:56,546 --> 01:48:58,086
Do not waste it...

1000
01:48:58,256 --> 01:49:00,126
for me.

1001
01:49:02,967 --> 01:49:04,957
I've already wasted my whole life.

1002
01:49:06,887 --> 01:49:09,457
I want to tell you with my last breath...

1003
01:49:11,598 --> 01:49:13,728
I have always loved you.

1004
01:49:49,682 --> 01:49:54,012
I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side...

1005
01:49:55,063 --> 01:49:56,893
as a condemned soul...

1006
01:49:59,653 --> 01:50:03,483
than enter heaven without you.

1007
01:50:05,454 --> 01:50:06,864
Because of your love...

1008
01:50:10,374 --> 01:50:14,454
I will never be a lonely spirit.

1009
01:51:10,401 --> 01:51:11,591
He's gone?

1010
01:51:41,225 --> 01:51:42,255
Bo...

1011
01:51:43,225 --> 01:51:46,055
please take this sword back to Sir Te.

1012
01:51:53,156 --> 01:51:55,196
Now you must go to Wudan Mountain.

1013
01:51:55,616 --> 01:51:57,316
Lo awaits you there.

1014
01:51:58,987 --> 01:52:00,447
Promise me one thing.

1015
01:52:00,997 --> 01:52:03,827
Whatever path you take in this life...

1016
01:52:04,247 --> 01:52:06,407
be true to yourself.

1017
01:54:00,750 --> 01:54:03,540
Do you remember the legend of the young man?

1018
01:54:05,671 --> 01:54:08,211
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."

1019
01:54:14,892 --> 01:54:16,632
Make a wish, Lo.

1020
01:54:19,393 --> 01:54:22,013
To be back in the desert, together again.
