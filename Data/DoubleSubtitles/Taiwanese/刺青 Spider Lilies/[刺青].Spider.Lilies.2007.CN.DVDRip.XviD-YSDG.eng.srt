01:07:05,822 --> 01:07:12,381
why...why the story you tell today is so wierd?

74
01:07:18,347 --> 01:07:19,475
It's only a story.

75
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:21,400
Don't think of it.

76
01:07:22,989 --> 01:07:24,748
My head hurts.

77
01:07:25,766 --> 01:07:26,979
Takeko.

78
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:30,250
why...I feel...

79
01:07:31,739 --> 01:07:33,109
you are angry with me.

80
01:07:34,868 --> 01:07:35,866
No, i'm not.

81
01:07:39,398 --> 01:07:41,272
Don't think too much.

82
01:07:42,469 --> 01:07:43,600
go back to sleep.

83
01:08:40,589 --> 01:08:41,062
Jade.

84
01:08:44,293 --> 01:08:45,456
is it mine?

85
01:08:46,674 --> 01:08:47,589
yes, it's yours.

86
01:08:53,801 --> 01:08:54,793
it's jasmine!

87
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:56,781
so it's not that Manjusaka.

88
01:08:58,349 --> 01:08:59,703
This is for you specially.

89
01:09:01,686 --> 01:09:02,667
This drawing is for me only?

90
01:09:05,406 --> 01:09:06,534
I understand.

91
01:09:07,112 --> 01:09:08,501
This should be my tattoo of love.

92
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:15,290
It's only a tattoo.

93
01:09:18,215 --> 01:09:19,594
No. it's love.

94
01:09:20,028 --> 01:09:22,259
I told you before, I need a tattoo of love.

95
01:09:23,185 --> 01:09:24,935
After I said that, you draw this jasmines for me.

96
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:29,624
It's only a tattoo.

97
01:09:32,265 --> 01:09:33,655
you have too many illusions!

98
01:09:36,096 --> 01:09:37,167
What's your meaning?

99
01:09:40,012 --> 01:09:41,524
Is it my illusion?

100
01:09:42,408 --> 01:09:43,807
Or you conceal yourself too much!

101
01:09:44,956 --> 01:09:46,331
Otherwise I will speak it out.

102
01:09:47,422 --> 01:09:49,763
You thought you log in my Blog anonymously, and I don't know who you are.

103
01:09:52,166 --> 01:09:54,450
That's you, why don't you admit the truth?

104
01:09:56,699 --> 01:09:57,822
I can't understand.

105
01:09:59,491 --> 01:10:02,166
Whether you despise me, or you just become a coward when you face your true feelings.

106
01:10:20,379 --> 01:10:21,230
I'm sorry.

107
01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:38,531
Why can you remember all these things?

108
01:10:45,307 --> 01:10:46,468
How about you?

109
01:10:48,713 --> 01:10:50,648
You choose to forget?

110
01:10:57,554 --> 01:10:58,854
I don't.

111
01:11:01,709 --> 01:11:04,098
Tell me the story of your tattoo...

112
01:11:05,648 --> 01:11:08,168
the tattoo on the wall, isn't it real?

113
01:11:14,859 --> 01:11:19,827
This is...my dad...when he was dead...

114
01:11:21,873 --> 01:11:23,365
my brother lost his memory of anything...

115
01:11:26,964 --> 01:11:28,368
All he can remember is this tattoo.

116
01:11:36,571 --> 01:11:42,739
the doctor said my brother lost his memory of all things.

117
01:11:48,454 --> 01:11:52,579
Please, give me the same tattoo pattern as my dad had.

118
01:11:55,557 --> 01:11:58,639
So...this is the reason that you had this tattoo?

119
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:02,676
They are the most important people in my life.

120
01:12:08,596 --> 01:12:10,067
Where is your mom?

121
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:12,872
did she return home?

122
01:12:17,121 --> 01:12:18,274
she will never return.

123
01:12:20,288 --> 01:12:21,331
Are you still mad at her?

124
01:12:25,771 --> 01:12:28,650
Rreally? mom! Do you really miss me?

125
01:12:31,446 --> 01:12:34,854
When you come home next time, where will you bring me to go.

126
01:12:36,677 --> 01:12:39,293
Tokyo? Is it Disney land?

127
01:12:39,998 --> 01:12:42,129
ok!ok!

128
01:12:44,199 --> 01:12:45,475
She doesn't remember me.

129
01:12:46,267 --> 01:12:47,375
just like you.

130
01:12:52,543 --> 01:12:53,742
So...

131
01:12:57,584 --> 01:12:59,425
I always have illusions.

132
01:13:00,691 --> 01:13:04,904
people are all around me.

133
01:13:27,239 --> 01:13:31,246
Will you remember me?

134
01:13:43,256 --> 01:13:43,891
hug me.

135
01:14:57,688 --> 01:14:59,417
Hello, cam video lovers.

136
01:14:59,955 --> 01:15:02,295
Do you wanna possess me privately tonight, my love.

137
01:15:02,815 --> 01:15:04,139
[off-line]

138
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:21,978
[Thank you for accepting my suggestion, don't come back...goodbye...
I love Jade.]

139
01:15:26,627 --> 01:15:28,735
Sir, it's...it's done.

140
01:15:40,839 --> 01:15:44,487
it is raining in the early morning

141
01:15:45,717 --> 01:15:49,257
dew moistens little jasmine

142
01:15:51,437 --> 01:15:56,330
its white leaves, chaste and fresh

143
01:15:57,232 --> 01:16:00,404
I covertly kiss your breath

144
01:16:02,532 --> 01:16:06,469
evening wind is breezing over grassland

145
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:11,848
sunset dyes little jasmine

146
01:16:13,939 --> 01:16:15,682
smile bursts, silently and soundlessly

147
01:16:47,442 --> 01:16:48,140
Takeko!

148
01:16:55,463 --> 01:16:59,503
Adong! Adong!

149
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:04,859
Adong!

150
01:19:35,102 --> 01:19:36,001
Ching!

151
01:19:37,839 --> 01:19:39,295
Ching! Ching!

152
01:19:41,165 --> 01:19:42,212
Ching!

153
01:19:42,725 --> 01:19:43,839
Ching!

154
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:44,995
Should Ching be upstairs?

155
01:19:46,375 --> 01:19:47,346
Ching!

156
01:19:47,846 --> 01:19:49,080
Ching!

157
01:20:04,189 --> 01:20:07,687
Sorry, I am the police of XZ district.

158
01:20:17,196 --> 01:20:19,526
as his case, he's in a coma, the point is  5...

159
01:20:19,748 --> 01:20:21,370
belongs to deep coma.

160
01:20:21,982 --> 01:20:23,910
I can't say whether he will wake up.

161
01:21:02,179 --> 01:21:03,705
Takeko!

162
01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:05,858
They are false!

163
01:21:08,013 --> 01:21:09,730
why they are false!

164
01:21:17,625 --> 01:21:18,607
Dad!

165
01:21:20,714 --> 01:21:22,447
I didn't mean to leave brother alone.

166
01:21:23,191 --> 01:21:24,349
I didn't!

167
01:21:36,672 --> 01:21:40,932
You thought you tattooed this flower on your body, then I would wake up?

168
01:22:35,768 --> 01:22:39,026
[I can't finish the tattoo, please forgive me, bye, Takeko]

169
01:23:04,735 --> 01:23:07,306
[All I know is your false tenderness
and the existence of that unfinished tattoo]

170
01:23:20,994 --> 01:23:24,117
[I can feel it...it's still...painful]

171
01:23:39,395 --> 01:23:41,896
I have no other choice.

172
01:23:44,778 --> 01:23:47,080
I can only live in virtual world.

173
01:23:54,732 --> 01:23:59,375
I will be waiting for you here day and night.

174
01:24:25,682 --> 01:24:26,592
[Silence: Jade! Jade!]

175
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:32,006
You come at last.

176
01:24:33,238 --> 01:24:34,078
[Get off line immediately!]

177
01:24:35,713 --> 01:24:37,105
[Get away from the internet!]

178
01:24:37,225 --> 01:24:38,645
No, I won't!

179
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:43,911
You ignore me. I am drowning.

180
01:25:03,106 --> 01:25:04,823
[Jade! please listen to me...]

181
01:25:06,844 --> 01:25:08,206
[I...am a police]

182
01:25:09,797 --> 01:25:10,839
what are you talking about!

183
01:25:17,774 --> 01:25:18,869
Ja...Jade...

184
01:25:19,632 --> 01:25:22,141
it's...it's....I...am...a police...

185
01:25:22,664 --> 01:25:25,309
We..we..decide to...to... search your website tonight...

186
01:25:28,297 --> 01:25:30,234
[we have been investigating this website for a long time.]

187
01:25:32,147 --> 01:25:34,398
[The whole course of search and arrest will be recorded.]

188
01:25:36,621 --> 01:25:38,239
[If you are still on line...]

189
01:25:39,284 --> 01:25:42,118
[You will appear to be one part of the evidence]

190
01:25:51,517 --> 01:25:52,606
Actually...

191
01:25:56,342 --> 01:25:59,610
the one who loves me is not Takeko...

192
01:26:13,498 --> 01:26:16,795
evening wind is breezing over grassland

193
01:26:18,664 --> 01:26:22,827
sunset dyes little jasmine

194
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:30,220
smile bursts, silently and soundlessly

195
01:26:31,282 --> 01:26:34,520
I cannot see your secret

196
01:26:37,141 --> 01:26:44,087
viridescent moonlight. the haze covers little jasmine

197
01:26:44,642 --> 01:26:47,144
little jasmine

198
01:26:48,406 --> 01:26:50,353
please remember me

199
01:26:52,694 --> 01:26:58,736
do never forget me

200
01:27:03,339 --> 01:27:06,000
I will get on line to wait for you.

201
01:27:06,659 --> 01:27:08,810
This is my last request...

202
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:14,166
Please...remember me.

203
01:28:15,585 --> 01:28:22,411
A computer can make you cry like this...

204
01:28:24,582 --> 01:28:25,669
Don't cry...don't cry...

205
01:28:26,962 --> 01:28:29,224
alright...don't think of the computer.

206
01:28:29,919 --> 01:28:31,554
Don't cry...don't cry...

207
01:29:07,131 --> 01:29:08,607
34234234

208
01:29:09,764 --> 01:29:13,557
423434

209
01:29:23,299 --> 01:29:24,251
Brother.

210
01:29:26,210 --> 01:29:27,778
sister!

211
01:31:07,418 --> 01:31:11,362
why can you remember all these things?

212
01:31:13,887 --> 01:31:15,178
And you?

213
01:31:17,948 --> 01:31:19,667
Do you choose to forget?

214
01:31:39,590 --> 01:31:41,361
[Sorry, I will wait for you in the tattoo shop...]

216
01:33:30,574 --> 01:33:35,500
the background of this movie is the 921 Taiwan earthquake(21th, Sep,1999), many people lost their families during the earthquake.
