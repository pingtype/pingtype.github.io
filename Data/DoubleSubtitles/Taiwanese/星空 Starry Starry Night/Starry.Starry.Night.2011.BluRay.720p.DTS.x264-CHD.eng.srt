1
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,875
Hello

2
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,873
Hello, Grandpa?

3
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,910
Can I come stay with you

4
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,355
in the mountains?

5
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,749
When I was little

6
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,517
I lived in the mountains

7
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,835
with my grandparents

8
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,958
Grandpa used to say

9
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,035
Just look up at the starry sky

10
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,316
and the whole world will seem so vast

11
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,871
They're all modern French artists

12
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,037
Come any time

13
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,759
We have on-site commentators

14
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,788
No problem, just call me

15
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,274
I'll wait for you there

16
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,191
No, it's really progressive

17
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,036
Who buys old paintings these days?

18
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,079
Modern art goes up in value

19
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,836
Sure

20
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,911
Next time there's an auction, we'll go

21
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,956
Hello

22
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,388
Hello, Grandpa

23
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,270
Mei?

24
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,075
Are you on the train?

25
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,715
You went home?

26
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,829
I'm home

27
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,549
Mei

28
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,078
Grandpa's wondering

29
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,397
what gift to make for you?

30
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,110
Oh

31
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,835
An elephant

32
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,279
A blue elephant

33
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,155
OK  I'll bring it when I come visit

34
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,029
Grandpa

35
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,159
Come soon

36
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,715
I really miss you

37
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,868
Mom, what are you doing?

38
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,510
Travel stuff

39
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,955
I'm leaving in two days

40
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,509
I'll be back before New Years

41
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,949
Again?

42
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,508
Haven't started?

43
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,830
Waiting for me?

44
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,270
Let's eat

45
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,796
What do you think?

46
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,914
It's silly

47
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,150
You're wearing a hat at the dinner table?

48
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,676
Mei

49
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,634
Dad made sweet and sour pork

50
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,149
your favorite

51
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,110
Mei

52
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,550
What's wrong?

53
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,833
My trip to Paris is cancelled

54
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,678
How come?

55
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,958
Come on, tell me what's going on

56
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,229
Can you just leave me alone?

57
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,073
Come back and finish dinner first

58
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,312
I need to be alone for a bit, please

59
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,069
Please get out of my room

60
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,395
Your room?

61
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,790
When did it become 'your' room?

62
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,872
When you put a bed in your study

63
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,634
What's that supposed to mean?

64
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,199
Let's not fight, OK?

65
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,829
It's not that serious

66
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,348
Yeah, it's never serious for you

67
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,350
it's always me

68
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,230
Shall we finish the 'Starry Night' puZZle?

69
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,955
Mei, go back to your room

70
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,833
I'll be there in a bit

71
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,110
All of us?

72
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,957
Be a good girl

73
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,275
Go back to your room

74
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,396
Good girl

75
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,955
Merry Christmas

76
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,669
I don't know who you are

77
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,238
But I want to tell you

78
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,629
Merry Christmas

79
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,954
GRADE 7, CLASS 3

80
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,995
OK, everybody

81
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,590
Settle down

82
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,915
Come on, Back to your seats

83
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,348
We have a new student

84
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,909
Come on, come on in

85
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,159
Introduce yourself

86
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,915
My name is Jay

87
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,309
He's a bit shy

88
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,592
His name is Jay

89
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,909
His last name is Chou

90
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,395
Jay Chou

91
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,033
He's joining our class

92
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,032
Let's all help him settle in

93
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,679
Let's give him a round of applause

94
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,190
You can sit there

95
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,717
Open up your books

96
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,916
Shawn

97
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,193
What chapter are we on?

98
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,316
I don't have my textbook

99
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,113
You confiscated it last time

100
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,358
Through interacting with others

101
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,153
We can better understand ourselves

102
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,396
Discover our strengths and weaknesses

103
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,797
And gain a sense of balance

104
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,672
If we find our strengths

105
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,750
we can use them

106
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,070
Build our self-confidence

107
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,078
And unlock our potential

108
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,310
You there!

109
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,315
We're in the middle of a lesson

110
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,550
Where do you think you're going?

111
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,350
The bathroom

112
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,399
You didn't think to ask?

113
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,914
May I go to the bathroom?

114
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,079
He's so cocky

115
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,556
Hurry back

116
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,349
Everyone else

117
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,030
Pay attention, let's continue

118
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,036
Mei

119
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,593
We're going for some crepes

120
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,636
Want to come?

121
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,916
I

122
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,519
Come on, let's go

123
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,355
I have to be home early

124
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,950
Next time, OK?

125
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,316
Next time

126
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,790
What are you doing?

127
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,670
Studying

128
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,628
Look what I bought you

129
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,955
Hang it up for me

130
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,638
No way!  Naked women!

131
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,437
Shawn!  What are you doing?

132
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,391
Let me see

133
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,749
You can look and I can't?

134
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,350
Check it what the new kid drew!

135
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,232
Go away!

136
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,555
Stop it!

137
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,271
You guys, look!

138
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,868
Look at the naked women!

139
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,637
Look!

140
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,752
Stop it guys!

141
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,071
Hey, Shawn

142
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:01,990
What are you doing?

143
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,357
Looking at naked women

144
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,195
Stop it!

145
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,073
Class rep  What happened?

146
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,349
He

147
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,635
Shawn

148
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,875
What's that?

149
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,115
Take a look yourself

150
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,030
Whose is this?

151
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,030
His

152
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,716
Don't take someone else's stuff!

153
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,596
Jay

154
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,196
I'm sorry

155
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,950
None of your business

156
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,155
Miss Chang

157
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,075
Jay's

158
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,919
Jay's sketchbook

159
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,754
How should I put it?

160
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,912
It's not that the school doesn't value art

161
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,071
It's just that, some of Jay's sketches

162
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,871
Can lead to some wrong thoughts

163
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,513
For the other students

164
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,870
You know schoolboys

165
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,517
They're very immature

166
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,952
They can't tell the difference

167
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,039
Between art and pornography

168
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,798
Just as long as you teachers can

169
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,319
Jay won't bring that sketchbook

170
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,669
to school anymore

171
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,350
Right?

172
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,349
You think you're cool?

173
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,790
Not so cocky now!

174
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,113
Kick him!

175
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,550
You asked for it!

176
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,795
Stop it!

177
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,595
Let Jay go!

178
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,429
Are you okay?

179
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,795
I'll survive

180
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,230
How many times have I told you

181
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,879
It is never OK to hurt a girl

182
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,916
Mrs Chou

183
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,559
Jay never hit me

184
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,877
Some boys were bullying me

185
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,795
Jay got hurt coming to help me

186
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,075
Mom, let's go

187
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,508
Is someone picking you up?

188
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,990
Yes

189
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:42,950
Thank you

190
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,831
The two of them

191
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,718
They were making out in an alley

192
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,836
Totally shameless!

193
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,870
No way!

194
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,069
Shawn saw

195
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,550
Dad

196
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,989
Help me with this

197
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,396
You went to see Grandpa?

198
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,275
Mei

199
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,155
Grandpa's sick

200
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,988
He's in the hospital

201
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,276
This elephant

202
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,398
was when I went to get Grandpa

203
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,954
he said to give it to you

204
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,998
Can I go see Grandpa?

205
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,909
It's past your bed time

206
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,675
Dad!

207
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,397
Let Grandpa rest a bit

208
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,069
I'll take you tomorrow

209
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,395
You coming too?

210
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,556
Come on

211
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,276
Let's go

212
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,513
We'll go see Grandpa together

213
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,275
Grandpa

214
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,670
Grandpa

215
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,750
Mei

216
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,789
Where's your Mom and Dad?

217
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,195
You came by yourself?

218
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,078
You can have the elephant

219
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,790
I don't want it

220
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,753
When you get better

221
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,756
Make him a fourth leg, then I'll take him

222
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,151
OK

223
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,231
Dad!

224
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,356
Mom!

225
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,395
We're going out

226
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,590
Be a good girl, stay home

227
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,710
Mei

228
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,352
We're leaving now

229
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,429
You're really not coming?

230
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,832
You don't want to say goodbye to Grandpa?

231
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,592
Don't force her if she doesn't want to

232
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,636
Hey, young lady!

233
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,916
Excuse me!

234
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,996
Mei

235
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,634
You forgot to pay

236
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,829
You forgot to pay

237
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,116
Mei

238
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,669
About

239
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,109
The

240
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,713
The classroom decoration contest

241
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,159
Teacher asked me to do it

242
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,235
I was wondering

243
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,078
Can you help me with it?

244
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,953
I can't finish by myself

245
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,196
OK

246
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,310
Really?

247
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,756
Morning

248
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,030
Good morning

249
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,028
I drew it out, just follow the steps

250
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,636
So now I'm up to

251
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,670
Here

252
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,795
This one

253
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,955
A bit to the left

254
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,195
Down a little

255
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,359
Check it out

256
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,035
Mei and Jay, they're at it again

257
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,072
Over there, being all lovey

258
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,716
Up a bit, over there

259
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,756
That's good

260
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,189
Shawn, what are you doing?

261
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,437
This looks good!

262
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,232
Can I have it?

263
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,117
Looks good, just like me

264
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:05,871
We match

265
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,995
Thanks!

266
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,435
Give it back

267
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,631
There are so many animals

268
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,353
Elephants, squirrels, sheep

269
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,595
Let me have this one  Thanks

270
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,029
Don't mess with other people's stuff

271
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,349
What!  I can't have it?

272
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,829
I'll take it if I want to!

273
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,830
What?

274
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,430
Knock it off!

275
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,153
What?  I dare you to hit me

276
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,998
Too scared?  Go on

277
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:25,918
Give it back

278
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,990
Shawn, stop it!

279
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,355
Keep at it and I'll get the teacher

280
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,550
Call him, I don't care

281
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,510
I'm not scared of him

282
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,590
Stop it, Shawn

283
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,273
Shawn, listen to the class rep

284
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,350
Here we go again

285
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,749
He's always like this

286
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,833
So childish

287
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,989
Shawn

288
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,995
Give it back

289
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,512
Who wants these stupid things, anyway

290
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,036
Mom

291
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,958
Get changed and we'll go eat, OK?

292
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,553
Mei, did you get a boyfriend?

293
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,756
Huh?

294
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,395
No

295
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,392
You've been coming home late

296
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,990
I told you, I'm busy with the competition

297
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,835
Are you happy?

298
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,832
Whatever you do

299
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,029
It's important to be happy

300
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,589
Mom

301
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,588
Are you happy?

302
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,919
Right now, I'm

303
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,229
really happy

304
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,393
Remember the dance I taught you

305
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,033
when you were little?

306
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,870
That step forward, step back

307
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,155
clap your hands one?

308
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,035
Dance with me

309
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,110
What?

310
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,790
Here?

311
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,870
Sure!

312
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,196
No!

313
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,315
Come on!

314
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,909
Ready

315
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,317
1  2 3 4 5 Jump!

316
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,516
Jump!

317
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,076
3  Jump

318
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,110
3  Jump

319
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,559
1  2 3  Jump

320
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,511
This is Monet's 'Woman with a Parasol'

321
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,077
The woman is his wife, Camille

322
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,237
The boy next to her is their son

323
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,991
This is 'The Lovers' by Magritte

324
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,393
This is Van Gogh's 'Sunflowers'

325
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,875
This is

326
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,878
Renoir's 'Luncheon of the Boating Party'

327
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,749
How do you know all this?

328
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,515
My Mom studied art in Paris

329
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,954
So starting from when I was little

330
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:47,871
Every year my family

331
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,553
did puZZles of famous paintings

332
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,914
But lately it's just me, by myself

333
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,036
Can I help you?

334
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,075
I want to buy 'Starry Night'

335
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,589
Starry Night

336
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,116
We have it in 300, 500

337
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,588
1 000 and 3000 pieces

338
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,716
Which one do you want?

339
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,636
I have the 1 000 pieces

340
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,751
But I lost a piece

341
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,753
Can you sell me one piece?

342
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,395
The center of the brightest star

343
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,072
We don't sell individual pieces

344
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,432
But, besides that

345
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,875
Feel free to look around

346
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,398
You know the origin of the jigsaw puZZle?

347
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,830
No

348
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,548
In 1 760

349
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,836
There was an English mapmaker

350
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,753
He stuck one of his maps

351
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,353
onto a wooden board

352
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,435
Then cut around the borders of the towns

353
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,757
And had his kids put it back together

354
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,109
When they were done

355
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,630
They knew where they lived, where home is

356
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,194
And that's the world's

357
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,509
first jigsaw puZZle

358
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,359
How do you know this?

359
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,235
It's over there

360
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,629
Origin of the PuZZle

361
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,395
You're silly!

362
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,995
It's written on there

363
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,108
And you memoriZed it?

364
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,239
My memory's good

365
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,869
Then

366
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,155
Say it again

367
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:19,797
One day

368
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,315
He stuck a map onto some wood

369
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,596
And then

370
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,831
He cut out the borders of the towns

371
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,428
Piece by piece

372
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,993
And his kids put them back together

373
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,875
So

374
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,072
The world's first jigsaw

375
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,316
Mom

376
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,035
Mom

377
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,670
You're not listening

378
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,436
Mei

379
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,829
If you're done eating, go to your room

380
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,155
I need to talk to your father

381
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,710
Let's go

382
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,549
We'll know tomorrow

383
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,679
if we win or not

384
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,350
What's wrong?

385
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,634
Do you think

386
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,868
The love between two people

387
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,389
can disappear?

388
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,716
Yes

389
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,356
What can be done?

390
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,230
I don't know

391
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,514
Stay with me a bit longer

392
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,036
This one's quite good

393
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,552
Yeah!  nice colors

394
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,753
This one

395
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,435
Not bad

396
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,673
You like this one?

397
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,795
No, no

398
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,710
It's ugly

399
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,878
I can't believe this one

400
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,555
'Roo' of Honor?

401
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,631
Let's go see class 3

402
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,149
So many people

403
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,753
Yeah, so many

404
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,875
Shawn!

405
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,836
Stop it!

406
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,595
Get him off!

407
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,590
Quickly!

408
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,955
Stop it!

409
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,037
Get out of the way!

410
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,395
Go away!  stop crowding!

411
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:33,716
Mom

412
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,309
We're moving again?

413
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,279
He's come back

414
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,148
Here, help mom with this

415
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:48,915
We'll talk inside

416
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,595
Mei, stop that

417
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,389
Mei!

418
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,234
Mom and Dad

419
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,955
We

420
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,039
Mom and Dad are getting divorced

421
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,389
Mom and Dad are getting divorced

422
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,552
Mei, you're 1 3

423
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,273
You understand, right?

424
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,033
Mei's 1 3, Mei understands

425
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,398
We spent a long time

426
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,908
Making this decision

427
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,877
This is best for everyone

428
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,949
This is best for everyone

429
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,676
This is between Mom and Dad

430
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,713
It's nothing to do with you

431
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,391
Don't think it's your fault

432
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,839
It's just that Mom and Dad

433
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,032
Can't live together anymore

434
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,597
We don't want to keep fighting

435
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,551
It's not fair to Mei

436
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,073
It's not fair to Mei

437
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,195
After the divorce

438
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,033
Mom will move out

439
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,832
You're in middle school now

440
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,435
You can decide who you want to live with

441
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,830
You don't have to make a decision now

442
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,112
And I won't move out right away

443
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,194
There's still a lot of things to sort out

444
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,439
We just thought

445
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,553
We should let you know

446
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,794
Mei

447
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,115
No rush

448
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,519
You can take your time

449
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,195
What are you doing?

450
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,714
So did you decide?

451
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,191
If Grandpa were still alive

452
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,829
They wouldn't be doing this

453
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,157
When did you last see the stars?

454
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,149
I don't remember

455
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,119
Let's go look at the stars

456
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:33,990
There's a truck!

457
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:38,991
What's up?

458
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:39,917
We're going to my Grandpa's house

459
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:40,876
Can we hitch a ride?

460
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,191
It's this way?

461
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:42,997
Yes

462
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,270
Hop on

463
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,636
Ride as far as you like

464
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:46,836
Thanks

465
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:48,952
Careful

466
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,070
Thank you

467
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,190
Bye bye!

468
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,434
When I was 6

469
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,678
My first day at school

470
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:49,111
This really embarrassing thing happened

471
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:50,675
Here

472
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,758
I took my lunchbox

473
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,878
And I went into the wrong classroom

474
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,519
When I was 8

475
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,635
I saw this girl playing piano on the TV

476
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:07,159
And I thought she was really beautiful

477
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,073
On my 9th birthday

478
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,759
I made my own birthday cake

479
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,389
It was a big green tea cake

480
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,758
When I finished, I thought it was ugly

481
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,832
But I took it to school

482
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,399
And my classmates ate it all

483
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,838
I didn't get a single bite

484
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,313
Last time I climbed this mountain

485
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,828
Was summer vacation two years ago

486
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,155
In this stream

487
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,719
When I played with Grandpa

488
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,672
Am I talking too much?

489
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:37,955
No

490
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,109
You say something

491
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,033
I don't have anything to say

492
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:43,989
Impossible

493
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,430
Everyone has stories

494
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,869
from when they were little

495
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,270
I don't

496
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,590
Stingy

497
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,035
I'm not

498
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,229
You big stingy

499
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,799
I'm not stingy

500
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,189
Yes you are!

501
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,196
Hey!

502
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,399
I think it's this way

503
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,873
Looks like the path on the right

504
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,514
I think

505
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,836
No one's walked that path for a while

506
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,593
But I remember it being on the left

507
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,510
You're sure?

508
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,796
Yes

509
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,389
It must be here

510
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,875
I remember these trees

511
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:34,910
Ah!

512
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,189
What's that!

513
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,715
It's nothing

514
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,116
Don't look, let's go

515
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:15,875
What shall we do?

516
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,593
Where are we?

517
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,196
Look!

518
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,749
There's a house!

519
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:10,915
Anyone here?

520
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,310
What?

521
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,639
I want to change clothes too

522
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:53,989
Didn't you bring any?

523
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:05,717
I'll go outside

524
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,029
Call me when you're done

525
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,788
No, don't leave!

526
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,315
I'm scared

527
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:23,589
Don't turn round!

528
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,435
OK

529
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,274
You're still there?

530
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,638
I'm   I'm still here

531
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:19,235
Jay!

532
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:21,795
Pervert

533
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,036
Jay?

534
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:37,790
Yeah

535
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,193
Do you think, if we die

536
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,238
Out here in the mountains

537
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,231
When people find us

538
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,433
They'll say we died for love?

539
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,669
You're silly!

540
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:54,788
I said 'if"

541
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:56,355
We're not going to die

542
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,629
But your Mom and Dad

543
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:05,035
Must be really worried about you

544
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,949
Who knows

545
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,076
Maybe they haven't even noticed I'm gone

546
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,229
That's not possible

547
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,153
One time, last year

548
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,830
They had a huge fight

549
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,750
And I wanted to come see Grandpa

550
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,432
I went to the train station

551
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,999
And sat there for ages

552
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,792
Finally, I went home

553
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,315
But when I got back

554
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,556
They were just in their rooms

555
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,510
With no idea I'd been gone

556
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:12,873
When I was 9

557
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,830
My dad had an accident in his factory

558
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,069
And lost his fingers

559
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,995
He stayed home every day, drinking

560
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:24,755
gambling

561
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,312
He started to hit my mom

562
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,437
He would grab her by the hair

563
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,713
and keep on slapping her

564
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,435
One day

565
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,039
My dad was drunk

566
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,278
He wanted me to drink with him

567
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:46,709
I refused

568
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,517
So he took all my awards

569
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,388
And ripped them all up

570
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,513
I couldn't help it, I started to cry

571
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,758
Then he started to hit me

572
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,232
He said I looked down on him

573
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,591
I didn't look down on him

574
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,190
I just wanted a normal dad

575
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,715
Why did I have to get a dad like this?

576
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,791
When my mom found out

577
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:41,676
We ran away from home

578
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,438
And moved far away

579
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:53,713
But not long after, Dad found us

580
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:57,951
So we kept on moving

581
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:59,834
And moving

582
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,719
And moving

583
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,669
You're actually lucky

584
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:31,955
Get up

585
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:35,275
Come on

586
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:38,190
Why?

587
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,156
Come here

588
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:42,949
Dance with me

589
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:43,916
I

590
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:49,673
I'll teach you

591
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,798
1  2 3 4 5  Jump!

592
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,309
1  2 3  Kick, clap!

593
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,350
Same this side

594
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,788
Kick, clap!

595
01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:59,435
What dance is this?

596
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,194
I don't know

597
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:04,991
My mom learnt it from an old movie

598
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:08,790
OK

599
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:10,229
Watch me first

600
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:14,320
1  2 3 4 5 Jump!

601
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,876
1  2 3 4

602
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:18,592
Three steps forward

603
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:19,391
1

604
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:20,152
2

605
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:21,151
3

606
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:21,991
Turn!

607
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,992
1  2 3 Jump!

608
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:24,871
Same this side

609
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:25,830
Kick   Clap

610
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:27,715
Kick   Clap

611
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:28,838
Three steps forward

612
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:29,671
1

613
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:30,352
2

614
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,231
3

615
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:32,750
Then like this

616
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:41,711
Good morning

617
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,070
Morning

618
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,316
Sleep well?

619
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,556
Yeah

620
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:58,638
Today we should follow the tracks

621
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,554
They should lead to the road

622
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:02,436
OK

623
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:13,277
Jay

624
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,271
Yeah?

625
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:16,510
Thank you

626
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,070
Huh, here again

627
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:45,915
Ladies first

628
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:47,509
You first!

629
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:48,590
No, you first!

630
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:49,715
You first!

631
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:50,830
I insist, you first

632
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:51,870
Let's go!

633
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:06,630
Almost there

634
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:08,709
You can tell by smelling the leaves

635
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:10,275
Trust me

636
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,515
Look!

637
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:57,955
Wait for me outside

638
01:12:58,840 --> 01:12:59,795
Is that OK?

639
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:05,275
Sure

640
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:53,549
Jay

641
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:54,796
Come in

642
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:55,790
OK

643
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,353
This is Grandpa's workbench

644
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:10,995
He made all of these

645
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,912
I painted these when I was little

646
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,034
This is my little desk

647
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,549
Here it is

648
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:53,679
When I was little

649
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,672
I came with Grandpa to look at the stars

650
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,313
Why won't the mist go away?

651
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:23,395
Give it time

652
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:30,912
I really hope

653
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:32,919
You can see the stars

654
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:02,635
Mei

655
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:06,034
For this short time

656
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,509
I've been so happy

657
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,116
I never knew I could be so happy

658
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:16,715
Knowing you

659
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,155
Now I know

660
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,313
I can be lucky, too

661
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:24,989
When I get home

662
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,999
I have to move again

663
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:33,834
My dad, he

664
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:52,589
Mei

665
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:54,915
Mei!

666
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:05,357
Your Grandpa's phone is cut off

667
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,439
I brought a cell phone

668
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:14,589
In my backpack

669
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:22,915
Sorry

670
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,317
I didn't mean to not tell you

671
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:28,675
It's just

672
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,038
If we used the cell phone

673
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:37,509
Our journey would have come to an end

674
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,308
Let's go home

675
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:53,789
Jay

676
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,552
Stay with me, OK?

677
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:30,715
Jay!

678
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,668
Jay!

679
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:48,909
Jay

680
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:01,195
Jay

681
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:36,957
Dad!

682
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:37,876
Mon!

683
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:08,315
Grandpa

684
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:43,989
Mei

685
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,797
I have a mom and dad who love me

686
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:47,555
Even though

687
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:50,392
they don't love each other anymore

688
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,556
I have classmates who care about me

689
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:56,635
Even though

690
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,272
they don't always understand me

691
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,672
Looking at my classmates walking away

692
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:04,635
I realiZed

693
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,715
Their summer was just starting

694
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,348
But my summer

695
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:12,673
Was already over

696
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,518
In my first year of high school

697
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:19,151
My mom and dad got divorced

698
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:21,231
A few years later

699
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:22,709
Mom went abroad and re-married

700
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,717
I chose to stay with Dad

701
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:29,953
At 1 3

702
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:31,993
We're very fragile

703
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,672
But at 1 3

704
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,678
We're also very tough

705
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:38,789
So

706
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:42,238
Before we have to face this cruel world

707
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:44,716
Please be gentle with us

708
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:47,312
We don't ask for much

709
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:49,188
A glance

710
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:50,675
A kind word

711
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:52,799
A rainstorm

712
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,234
A gust of wind

713
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:55,955
or

714
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:58,077
Just a nod of the head goodbye

715
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:00,557
It's these little kindnesses

716
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,595
That make us feel special

717
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:07,671
But in the end

718
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,516
I never got the goodbye I wanted

719
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,548
After that

720
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,070
I never saw Jay again

721
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,119
The little rabbit

722
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:20,316
never turned into a big rabbit

723
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:21,875
The little elephant

724
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:23,752
never turned into a big elephant

725
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:25,912
The only thing that grew

726
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:30,269
was me

727
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:17,872
Everything passes

728
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:22,196
But before letting go

729
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:25,194
Hold on, as tight as you can

730
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:04,949
Paris - Years later

731
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:16,629
Mei!

732
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:26,594
Merry Christmas!

733
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:31,915
Are you happy?

734
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,069
Yeah

735
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:34,077
Let's take a walk!

736
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,116
OK

737
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,194
Happy at school?

738
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:40,793
Yeah

739
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:42,870
You've made friends?

740
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:43,711
Yeah

741
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:44,352
How many?

742
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:45,629
Five

743
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:50,948
Do you hear that?

744
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:52,434
Yes

745
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:56,912
So beautiful!

746
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:42,629
It's Mommy

747
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:46,034
Mommy, where are you?

748
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:49,958
I'm with big sister

749
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:57,715
She bought me lots of presents!

750
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,148
OK

751
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:00,959
See you soon

752
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:03,714
Bye bye, Mommy

753
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:06,113
Hi, MOm

754
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,638
Everything's good

755
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:09,869
Yes

756
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:11,709
She's being good

757
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:17,157
Mom, it's no problem

758
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:31,069
Mom, it's snowing

759
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:34,908
Did you pick up Dad?

760
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:38,715
No need

761
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,279
I'll see you guys at dinner

762
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:48,994
What you looking at?

763
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:51,629
Why is it missing a piece?

764
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:59,235
Mom

765
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:00,629
See you in a bit

766
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:01,909
Yes

767
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:38,949
Merry Christmas

768
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,393
Can I help you?

769
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:57,199
Do you still remember?

770
01:32:57,640 --> 01:32:58,868
That summer

771
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:00,269
That most splendid

772
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:02,837
Most lonely of starry nights
