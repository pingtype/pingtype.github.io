1
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:00,709
It's getting dark

2
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:02,084
stop whistling.

3
00:01:02,168 --> 00:01:03,876
Can I sing then?

4
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:05,376
Hush!

5
00:01:06,043 --> 00:01:08,626
Where are we sleeping today?

6
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:10,543
If they don't have a room,

7
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:12,459
there's always the pigpen.

8
00:01:12,543 --> 00:01:13,459
Don't worry.

9
00:01:14,334 --> 00:01:15,793
That's too stinky!

10
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:16,834
Stop whining!

11
00:01:16,918 --> 00:01:18,876
Otherwise, I won't take you out next time.

12
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:21,126
Listen to me.

13
00:01:21,793 --> 00:01:23,543
Don't nibble on food while cooking.

14
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:24,501
If there's not enough food,

15
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,709
I'll chop your hands off and use them.

16
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:28,876
Okay.

17
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:32,251
If you don't behave,

18
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:34,501
I'll send you back.

19
00:01:34,584 --> 00:01:35,793
You won't get any food

20
00:01:35,876 --> 00:01:37,376
with 11 brothers at home!

21
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:38,834
Don't do that, Master!

22
00:01:38,918 --> 00:01:40,876
Don't send me back.

23
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,751
Here we are! Here we are!

24
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:44,709
See that house?

25
00:01:46,876 --> 00:01:47,459
Let's go catering!

26
00:01:47,918 --> 00:01:48,876
Let's go catering!

27
00:02:35,418 --> 00:02:37,334
Go! Get the lead actress.

28
00:02:37,418 --> 00:02:38,251
Stand-in girl,

29
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:39,834
you can leave.

30
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:41,418
Go take a nap in the back.

31
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:42,876
Don't snore too loud.

32
00:02:45,584 --> 00:02:46,543
Cut! Cut! Cut!

33
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,668
Don't you know how to walk?

34
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:49,834
Where did we find her?

35
00:02:49,918 --> 00:02:50,751
Who are you?

36
00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:52,501
Hello! How is everyone?

37
00:02:52,584 --> 00:02:54,126
I'm Chan Hsiao Wan.

38
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:55,626
I eat big bowls of stewed pork over rice.

39
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,376
My nickname is

40
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:58,876
"Slacker".

41
00:02:58,959 --> 00:02:59,793
Not a pretty name?

42
00:02:59,876 --> 00:03:02,959
This is my 382nd audition.

43
00:03:03,543 --> 00:03:05,209
I should've been born

44
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:06,668
in a world of high-end fashion.

45
00:03:07,043 --> 00:03:10,084
But God must have made a mistake.

46
00:03:10,168 --> 00:03:11,376
Here's the file for Chan Hsiao Wan.

47
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:12,876
Load it into your computer.

48
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:18,959
And by accident I ended up

49
00:03:19,043 --> 00:03:20,668
among a bunch of vegetables.

50
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:24,751
My dad was a famous catering master
in the South.

51
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:26,751
Known as Master Fly Spirit.

52
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,709
8 flies.

53
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:36,543
My stepmother is known as

54
00:03:36,626 --> 00:03:38,043
Puffy.

55
00:03:38,126 --> 00:03:39,751
This isn't just some ordinary fish.

56
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:41,501
It's a friend of "Vicky the Viking".

57
00:03:41,584 --> 00:03:42,501
"Luffy" is its name.

58
00:03:42,584 --> 00:03:44,293
You know, Luffy from "One Piece"?

59
00:03:44,376 --> 00:03:45,626
He's the one that caught it!

60
00:03:45,918 --> 00:03:48,209
Every time my dad cooked,

61
00:03:48,293 --> 00:03:50,626
he turned into a monster.

62
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:53,126
His shack was so hot and humid.

63
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:54,501
It was worse than hell.

64
00:03:55,043 --> 00:03:57,001
Whenever I feel bad,

65
00:03:57,084 --> 00:03:58,626
I'd put a box over my head.

66
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:01,001
And enter into another world.

67
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:02,084
Yes.

68
00:04:02,168 --> 00:04:02,793
I'm afraid of fish.

69
00:04:04,918 --> 00:04:06,418
And I hate greasy smoke.

70
00:04:08,376 --> 00:04:11,001
Dad always wanted me to cook.

71
00:04:12,876 --> 00:04:14,418
But I just want to be a model

72
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:16,709
and live a fabulous life.

73
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,168
However,

74
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:21,793
even on his death bed,

75
00:04:21,876 --> 00:04:23,001
my dad still wanted to give me

76
00:04:23,084 --> 00:04:25,209
his notebook of recipes.

77
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,293
But

78
00:04:34,376 --> 00:04:36,418
Dad, forgive me.

79
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,793
I never want to become a catering master.

80
00:04:41,126 --> 00:04:42,959
Jerry, are you on your way back?

81
00:04:43,043 --> 00:04:44,376
You don't need to buy a gift.

82
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:46,501
I've prepared a big dinner. Hurry back.

83
00:04:46,584 --> 00:04:49,126
I also ordered a cake. Don't worry.

84
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,043
Surprise!

85
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:55,126
Cake delivery,

86
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:56,459
600.

87
00:04:57,043 --> 00:04:58,043
Hold on.

88
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:13,751
Here you go! 600.

89
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:15,001
Thanks!

90
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:16,168
You guys?

91
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:17,293
Don't worry.

92
00:05:17,376 --> 00:05:19,043
We're not bad guys.

93
00:05:19,126 --> 00:05:21,709
Are you Miss Chan Hsiao Wan?

94
00:05:22,793 --> 00:05:23,751
Here.

95
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:28,209
Oh,

96
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:29,459
my boyfriend borrowed this.

97
00:05:29,543 --> 00:05:31,251
Not me.

98
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:34,876
Didn't you sign as the guarantor?

99
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,084
I did. He asked me to sign it.

100
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:37,918
Right.

101
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:38,918
Nice!

102
00:05:39,168 --> 00:05:40,709
Hey hey hey.

103
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:45,959
Where's your boyfriend?

104
00:05:47,168 --> 00:05:50,668
He left for a for days
to see a property in Nantou.

105
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:52,543
Have you heard from him?

106
00:05:52,626 --> 00:05:54,043
He said there's no reception there.

107
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:55,834
He told me not to call him.

108
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:58,959
He's on the run.

109
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:01,543
No.

110
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:02,918
He wouldn't do that.

111
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:04,084
He'll pay you back the money.

112
00:06:06,584 --> 00:06:08,293
Silly girls like you

113
00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:10,709
I've seen a lot of them.

114
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:13,209
Must be so lonely

115
00:06:13,293 --> 00:06:15,459
celebrating a birthday by yourself.

116
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:16,501
So lonely.

117
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,543
Let's help you celebrate!

118
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:20,293
Get the candles!

119
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:25,334
We wish your cake gets moldy.

120
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,584
We wish you have no water to shower with.

121
00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:30,334
We wish you see a ghost.

122
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:33,709
Wish you flunk all your tests.

123
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:36,126
Blow out the candles.

124
00:06:41,043 --> 00:06:42,709
Cut the cake.

125
00:06:42,793 --> 00:06:45,584
Let me show you how well I cut.

126
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:48,168
Hold that.

127
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:50,751
Happy Birthday!

128
00:06:55,293 --> 00:06:57,834
I'll give you 3 days to get the money.

129
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,043
We're good at tracking and hunting.

130
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:03,459
We have all the information about you.

131
00:07:03,543 --> 00:07:05,584
We know where your home is in the south.

132
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:07,251
Don't even think about hiding.

133
00:07:10,293 --> 00:07:12,126
Call me anytime.

134
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,584
Poor lovely flower,

135
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:18,084
see you!

136
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:19,668
Hey hey hey.

137
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:02,293
What are you doing?

138
00:08:02,376 --> 00:08:03,626
Hello.

139
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,876
My bag, my bag.

140
00:08:09,334 --> 00:08:11,293
My cosmetics.

141
00:08:11,376 --> 00:08:12,293
What?

142
00:08:12,376 --> 00:08:14,126
They're not sausages?

143
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:14,959
Sausages my ass!

144
00:08:15,043 --> 00:08:16,626
This is Chanel!

145
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:18,626
I guess I can't eat them.

146
00:08:23,376 --> 00:08:25,001
All broken.

147
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:06,251
What the heck?

148
00:09:06,334 --> 00:09:08,293
I'm getting rid of a fly.

149
00:09:08,376 --> 00:09:10,209
It's a tattoo!

150
00:09:10,293 --> 00:09:11,043
Oh!

151
00:09:11,126 --> 00:09:12,251
It looks so real.

152
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:14,668
What kind of fly is it?

153
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,126
The kind that's none of your business.

154
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:38,376
What?

155
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,293
They're not sausages?

156
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,043
Are you looking for something?

157
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:49,293
No, no.

158
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:52,376
Is the fly still there?

159
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:04,501
Miss!

160
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:07,751
Is this yours?

161
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:09,418
Yes, thanks a lot.

162
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:10,459
In life...

163
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,293
there are some things we should forget.

164
00:10:13,168 --> 00:10:14,668
But never forget your luggage.

165
00:10:21,793 --> 00:10:22,751
Boss,

166
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:24,626
your sticky dumpling tastes bad.

167
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:26,168
No wonder business is so bad.

168
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:27,626
Here.

169
00:10:29,126 --> 00:10:30,793
Gourmet Doctor

170
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:31,918
Yeh Ru Hai.

171
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:33,084
That's right.

172
00:10:33,543 --> 00:10:35,126
I'm a gourmet doctor specializing in

173
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:36,209
transforming terrible food

174
00:10:36,293 --> 00:10:38,959
from garbage into delicious dishes.

175
00:10:39,043 --> 00:10:40,251
With me here,

176
00:10:40,334 --> 00:10:41,668
your sticky dumplings are saved.

177
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:53,126
Mrs. Yang,

178
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:54,668
it's me. I'm Wan!

179
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:57,959
Wan!

180
00:10:58,043 --> 00:10:58,959
You're so beautiful now.

181
00:10:59,043 --> 00:11:00,751
I hardly recognized you.

182
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:02,168
Mrs. Yang,

183
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:03,793
what happened to my home?

184
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:04,751
Your mom

185
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:05,876
is on the run.

186
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:07,709
On the run?

187
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:10,168
Your mom told me

188
00:11:10,251 --> 00:11:10,959
to give you her new address.

189
00:11:11,043 --> 00:11:12,668
If you came home looking for her.

190
00:11:14,043 --> 00:11:15,001
Don't worry.

191
00:11:15,084 --> 00:11:17,209
I won't tell anyone.

192
00:11:18,793 --> 00:11:19,959
Thanks Mrs. Yang.

193
00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:27,459
Wang Chi Dan!

194
00:11:27,543 --> 00:11:29,459
Did you forget your own business?

195
00:11:29,543 --> 00:11:30,543
Yes, yes, yes.

196
00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:31,501
Just stay there then.

197
00:11:31,584 --> 00:11:32,293
Don't bother coming back.

198
00:11:32,376 --> 00:11:33,376
You can get a job there as a busboy.

199
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,668
Wang Chi Dan, Wang Chi Dan,

200
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:36,334
You bastard.

201
00:11:38,084 --> 00:11:39,543
Ma'am,

202
00:11:39,626 --> 00:11:41,751
what's going on?

203
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,751
The owner of that restaurant.

204
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:44,918
Thinks she's still hot stuff.

205
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:46,501
Offers a dance show every Wednesday.

206
00:11:46,584 --> 00:11:48,918
It's embarrassing at her age.

207
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:49,834
Let me tell you.

208
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,376
Being able to cook is what's important.

209
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:53,959
We're here to sell food, not ourselves.

210
00:11:54,043 --> 00:11:55,959
You bastard, get your ass back here.

211
00:12:06,668 --> 00:12:07,918
Don't have a hubby now

212
00:12:08,001 --> 00:12:09,168
Don't have a hubby now

213
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:11,751
Sleep all by myself

214
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:13,209
Don't have a hubby now

215
00:12:13,293 --> 00:12:14,459
Don't have a hubby now

216
00:12:14,543 --> 00:12:17,168
For rice, for noodle and the aroma.

217
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,709
Come in, come in.

218
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,918
We have noodles and rice.

219
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:35,584
Come in, miss.

220
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:36,584
Come in and eat.

221
00:12:37,168 --> 00:12:37,959
Come on, handsome.

222
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:38,793
Handsome.

223
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:42,543
Look at this hot girl.

224
00:12:42,626 --> 00:12:43,959
Who is she?

225
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:46,084
Chan Hsiao Wan.

226
00:12:46,168 --> 00:12:47,168
She's in show business.

227
00:12:47,251 --> 00:12:48,418
She's in show business.

228
00:12:48,793 --> 00:12:49,751
Isn't she pretty?

229
00:12:50,293 --> 00:12:50,959
Yeah,

230
00:12:51,043 --> 00:12:52,376
9.2 out of 10!

231
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:53,501
9.2 out of 10!

232
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:55,501
Why are you dancing out here?

233
00:12:55,584 --> 00:12:57,084
Trying to attract more business.

234
00:12:57,168 --> 00:12:58,709
How am I going to get by without money?

235
00:12:58,793 --> 00:12:59,793
Give it to me.

236
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:02,334
It's embarrassing!

237
00:13:02,418 --> 00:13:03,918
What's embarrassing about it?

238
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:06,001
It's the same as you being a "model".

239
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:07,543
Not even close.

240
00:13:07,626 --> 00:13:10,126
What's your problem?
You come to pick a fight?

241
00:13:17,376 --> 00:13:18,626
Did you eat yet?

242
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:21,709
Why did you open a restaurant here?

243
00:13:22,376 --> 00:13:24,043
And why is our house foreclosed?

244
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:25,918
I owe money.

245
00:13:26,876 --> 00:13:28,084
So much money that you lost the house?

246
00:13:28,168 --> 00:13:30,084
I just lost a bet.

247
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,459
You placed a bet? On what?

248
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:36,084
Remember Tsai?

249
00:13:38,043 --> 00:13:40,209
Of course, he was Dad's apprentice.

250
00:13:43,376 --> 00:13:46,126
He's taken all your dad's old customers.

251
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:47,751
And even stole some of our best cooks.

252
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:49,751
He left me with no business.

253
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:52,543
And no way to make a living.

254
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:55,418
I heard he's in the
frozen food business now.

255
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,876
Why don't you just retire?

256
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,084
No way!

257
00:13:58,168 --> 00:14:01,043
This mama can't stand to see
what they're doing.

258
00:14:01,126 --> 00:14:02,418
Instead of simmering stock,

259
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:03,959
they use MSG.

260
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:06,918
They make ice sculptures with molds.

261
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:08,876
They use pre-processed flavoring.

262
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,293
And worst of all,

263
00:14:10,376 --> 00:14:12,459
they serve fries at banquets.

264
00:14:15,084 --> 00:14:17,168
I could eat some fries.

265
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:19,793
Yeah, fries are pretty good.

266
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:21,918
But for a banquet?

267
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:24,418
Kiss our catering tradition good bye.

268
00:14:24,501 --> 00:14:25,376
If your dad knew about this

269
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:26,751
it would piss him off so bad

270
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:27,918
he'd rise from his grave to kick some ass.

271
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:31,584
Mom,

272
00:14:31,668 --> 00:14:34,334
Dad was cremated. His ashes is in an urn.

273
00:14:42,084 --> 00:14:43,751
Oh, right.

274
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:44,668
No matter what

275
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:46,418
he can't ruin your dad's reputation

276
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:48,084
as Master Fly Spirit.

277
00:14:48,168 --> 00:14:49,209
Otherwise, people in future generations

278
00:14:49,293 --> 00:14:51,918
will think that catering is nothing special.

279
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:55,001
So, you placed a bet with them?

280
00:14:55,084 --> 00:14:57,709
Director Hong was going to ask Tsai

281
00:14:57,793 --> 00:14:59,668
to cater a banquet for 30 tables.

282
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:01,043
I went to Hong

283
00:15:01,126 --> 00:15:02,959
to ask for 10 tables.

284
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:05,334
Where did you get the self-confidence?

285
00:15:07,043 --> 00:15:08,293
My self-confidence?

286
00:15:08,376 --> 00:15:09,626
Who am I?

287
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:12,209
I'm a legend throughout this island.

288
00:15:12,293 --> 00:15:14,084
Wife of the late Master Fly Spirit.

289
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:16,793
Why wouldn't I have self-confidence?

290
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:18,626
So what happened?

291
00:15:19,876 --> 00:15:21,793
In order to defeat Tsai,

292
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:28,543
Mama threw in all my money and more.

293
00:15:28,626 --> 00:15:31,084
For the cold starter I served

294
00:15:31,168 --> 00:15:33,043
lobster, abalone,

295
00:15:33,126 --> 00:15:35,126
sea-ear shell, mullet roe

296
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:36,334
and squid.

297
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:40,334
At the same time,

298
00:15:40,418 --> 00:15:43,209
Tsai also served his cold starter.

299
00:15:43,293 --> 00:15:45,084
Which also had lobster.

300
00:15:45,168 --> 00:15:47,626
But my lobster was lying flat.

301
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:49,209
While his lobster was standing upright.

302
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:50,459
And also

303
00:15:50,543 --> 00:15:51,834
blowing out smoke.

304
00:15:56,751 --> 00:15:58,584
Then you lost on the first course.

305
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:00,751
It was followed by the chicken course.

306
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:03,751
He served

307
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:05,626
Chicken in a Pot.

308
00:16:09,543 --> 00:16:13,626
Mama then served the winner...

309
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:14,334
We served

310
00:16:14,418 --> 00:16:16,334
Stuffed Chicken

311
00:16:16,418 --> 00:16:18,001
Dad used to say that

312
00:16:18,084 --> 00:16:19,418
that dish was hard to make.

313
00:16:19,501 --> 00:16:20,793
You have to remove the bones
and gizzards

314
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:22,793
from the chicken first.

315
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:24,376
Yes, and stuff ingredients inside

316
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:26,418
before steaming it.

317
00:16:26,501 --> 00:16:27,209
Am I right?

318
00:16:30,376 --> 00:16:31,668
You must have won this course.

319
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:34,709
I don't know why,

320
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:36,668
but the chicken's exploded.

321
00:16:36,751 --> 00:16:37,543
What happened?

322
00:16:37,626 --> 00:16:38,876
Cover it up with vegetables!

323
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:47,793
And then?

324
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:49,918
Everything else was a mess.

325
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:51,959
Crab Rice Cakes too hard.

326
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:53,876
Braised Ribs over done.

327
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:56,543
Buddha Jumping Over Wall too salty.

328
00:16:56,626 --> 00:16:57,418
I can't explain how

329
00:16:57,501 --> 00:16:59,293
even the sweet dessert soup
turned out salty.

330
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:01,168
No wonder people call you Puffy.

331
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:03,209
Your food sucks!

332
00:17:03,668 --> 00:17:06,001
The catering master's a woman.
That's why.

333
00:17:06,084 --> 00:17:07,834
I'm a man.

334
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:09,751
I'm so mad.

335
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:11,501
Don't be mad, Director Hong.

336
00:17:11,584 --> 00:17:13,709
Come on, let's go have a drink.

337
00:17:27,168 --> 00:17:28,334
Dad's marvelous reputation

338
00:17:28,418 --> 00:17:29,918
totally ruined by you.

339
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:33,084
So there's a popular saying now:

340
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:34,334
"Pigs will throw up"

341
00:17:34,418 --> 00:17:35,668
"Cats will run screaming"

342
00:17:35,751 --> 00:17:37,043
"We'd rather go hungry"

343
00:17:37,126 --> 00:17:38,251
"than having to eat;'

344
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:40,001
"Puffy's food."

345
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:44,293
It's not funny!

346
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:46,793
I lost my shirt on this bet.

347
00:17:46,876 --> 00:17:48,876
Dad said you're not cut out for this.

348
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:51,209
You were just asking for trouble.

349
00:17:51,293 --> 00:17:53,459
Your dad said you had talent. So?

350
00:17:53,543 --> 00:17:55,043
Ran off to Taipei to be a "model".

351
00:17:55,126 --> 00:17:57,501
I still haven't seen you on TV.

352
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:58,793
Or are you actually

353
00:17:58,876 --> 00:18:00,251
an adult video actress?

354
00:18:01,001 --> 00:18:02,793
How can you say that?

355
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:04,209
What do you want me to say?

356
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:06,709
Did I say it's bad to be an AV actress?

357
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:09,543
Being an AV actress
is also a real profession.

358
00:18:09,626 --> 00:18:10,459
The way you say

359
00:18:10,543 --> 00:18:11,959
sounds like you look down on them.

360
00:18:12,043 --> 00:18:12,668
I don't!

361
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:13,251
You do!

362
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:13,876
I don't!

363
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:14,959
You do!

364
00:18:15,043 --> 00:18:16,751
So, are you really an AV actress now?

365
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:18,334
So what if I am?

366
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,876
Then I want to watch it.

367
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:27,251
Show me!

368
00:18:27,334 --> 00:18:28,959
Show you what?

369
00:18:29,043 --> 00:18:30,334
I want to watch it.

370
00:18:41,376 --> 00:18:44,126
Are you in softcore or hardcore?

371
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:45,543
I'm not in either!

372
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:47,459
I will never be an AV actress!

373
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,709
Have you shown all your body parts?

374
00:18:50,584 --> 00:18:51,459
Stop it!

375
00:18:53,584 --> 00:18:54,793
Please come in.

376
00:18:54,876 --> 00:18:56,293
What can I get for you
three handsome boys?

377
00:18:56,376 --> 00:18:57,334
We're not handsome boys.

378
00:18:57,418 --> 00:18:58,293
We are

379
00:18:58,376 --> 00:18:59,501
"Animals on Call".

380
00:18:59,584 --> 00:19:00,626
I'm Monster Tsai.

381
00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:01,668
I'm Beast Liu.

382
00:19:01,751 --> 00:19:03,001
I'm Demon Li.

383
00:19:03,084 --> 00:19:03,626
Rice with Pork Chop.

384
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:04,293
Rice with Chicken Leg.

385
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:05,668
Fried Rice with Egg.

386
00:19:06,043 --> 00:19:06,668
Okay!

387
00:19:06,751 --> 00:19:07,918
Right away.

388
00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:10,418
Put the tomato in here.

389
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,501
Put it in.

390
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:13,918
All of it, all of it.

391
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:15,876
When Ah Fa was a kid

392
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:21,126
he wanted Scrambled Tomato
and Eggs every afternoon.

393
00:19:21,209 --> 00:19:23,209
Now he's in prison

394
00:19:23,918 --> 00:19:26,709
so it's hard to eat what he wants.

395
00:19:26,793 --> 00:19:28,793
Did you draw this?

396
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,001
Yes.

397
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:32,668
It's really good.

398
00:19:34,918 --> 00:19:36,126
Auntie,

399
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:37,459
is that a century egg?

400
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,043
Yes, it is.

401
00:19:39,126 --> 00:19:39,876
You made it yourself?

402
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:40,959
Yes.

403
00:19:41,043 --> 00:19:42,543
Feel free to try it.

404
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,168
It has a tea flavor.

405
00:19:47,376 --> 00:19:49,126
You're an expert.

406
00:19:49,209 --> 00:19:51,293
We soak it with tea leaves.

407
00:19:52,418 --> 00:19:55,459
Dump that asshole!

408
00:19:55,543 --> 00:19:57,459
Such a stupid girl.

409
00:19:58,293 --> 00:19:59,751
Who are you talking to?

410
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:00,959
Hsia.

411
00:20:01,043 --> 00:20:01,959
Hsia?

412
00:20:02,043 --> 00:20:03,376
Who's she?

413
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:05,668
A character on this show.

414
00:20:07,209 --> 00:20:09,126
Why haven't you taken a bath yet?

415
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,418
The show's not over.

416
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:14,751
When are you going back?

417
00:20:15,584 --> 00:20:17,084
I'm not going back.

418
00:20:17,168 --> 00:20:18,293
Why?

419
00:20:19,376 --> 00:20:20,709
I'm on the run.

420
00:20:22,543 --> 00:20:25,251
Maybe we can run away together.

421
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,501
How much you owe?

422
00:20:28,751 --> 00:20:30,543
Around 900 thousand.

423
00:20:31,751 --> 00:20:33,293
That's a lot!

424
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:36,084
Hard to make money in the AV business?

425
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,001
You're not popular anymore.

426
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:40,834
You silly girl.

427
00:20:40,918 --> 00:20:42,834
Dump that asshole.

428
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:51,001
Hey,

429
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:53,043
what are you looking at?

430
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:56,043
Just checking on their business today.

431
00:20:56,584 --> 00:20:57,793
They have a new "spicy" girl.

432
00:20:57,876 --> 00:20:59,126
But their business

433
00:20:59,209 --> 00:21:00,334
isn't any better.

434
00:21:00,418 --> 00:21:01,626
I've told you many times.

435
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:03,918
Tasty is more important than spicy.

436
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:08,376
Spicy is really important, too.

437
00:21:11,126 --> 00:21:12,043
Here.

438
00:21:12,126 --> 00:21:13,709
Ma'am,

439
00:21:13,793 --> 00:21:16,334
do you want
to make your beef stew tastier?

440
00:21:18,418 --> 00:21:20,668
I'm Doctor Gourmet.

441
00:21:23,084 --> 00:21:26,001
Why do you dress like
an elevator girl everyday?

442
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,376
It's called fashion.

443
00:21:27,459 --> 00:21:28,876
You just don't understand.

444
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:31,043
It's more like flashing to me.

445
00:21:35,251 --> 00:21:36,543
Welcome.

446
00:21:38,043 --> 00:21:40,334
Animals on Call, right?

447
00:21:40,418 --> 00:21:41,376
What would you like to have?

448
00:21:41,459 --> 00:21:42,001
Fried Rice with Egg.

449
00:21:42,084 --> 00:21:42,918
Rice with Pork Chop.

450
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:43,918
Rice with Chicken Leg.

451
00:21:44,001 --> 00:21:45,501
Same as yesterday?

452
00:21:45,584 --> 00:21:46,668
In different order.

453
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:49,001
I had Rice with Pork Chop last time.

454
00:21:51,084 --> 00:21:53,251
Just a second. Have a seat.

455
00:21:55,293 --> 00:21:57,043
Can we take a picture with you?

456
00:21:57,709 --> 00:21:58,668
Sure.

457
00:21:58,751 --> 00:21:59,793
We've decided to start a fan club for you.

458
00:21:59,876 --> 00:22:01,126
We've decided to start a fan club for you.

459
00:22:01,918 --> 00:22:02,584
If you're ever in trouble,

460
00:22:02,668 --> 00:22:03,626
just call us.

461
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:05,459
We'll take care of everything.

462
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:07,584
I want a picture too.

463
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:08,501
Here.

464
00:22:08,584 --> 00:22:09,793
Over here.

465
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:13,126
Come on,

466
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:14,584
one more.

467
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:16,668
Have a seat!

468
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:17,501
What are you having?

469
00:22:17,584 --> 00:22:18,709
Have a seat!

470
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:20,293
Hello.

471
00:22:20,376 --> 00:22:21,709
I'm Mr. Huang.

472
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:24,084
I'm looking for Master Fly Spirit.

473
00:22:24,168 --> 00:22:25,626
Master Fly Spirit?

474
00:22:26,626 --> 00:22:28,084
How did you find this place?

475
00:22:28,168 --> 00:22:30,543
His neighbor's wife told us.

476
00:22:33,126 --> 00:22:34,126
Don't worry.

477
00:22:34,209 --> 00:22:36,209
I won't tell anyone.

478
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:40,126
Why are you looking for him?

479
00:22:40,209 --> 00:22:42,168
I'd like him to cater for me.

480
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:44,334
For your grandson's wedding?

481
00:22:44,418 --> 00:22:46,126
No.

482
00:22:46,209 --> 00:22:47,876
It's for our wedding.

483
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,376
Congratulations!

484
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:51,959
How many tables?

485
00:22:52,043 --> 00:22:54,959
Just one table, ten courses.

486
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:56,168
And I have the menu.

487
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:57,834
Let me see.

488
00:22:59,001 --> 00:23:00,668
Eight Treasures Rice Cake Rolls,

489
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:03,751
Darkened Vinegar Prawns,
Stuffed Sea Eels.

490
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:06,209
Why these traditional dishes?

491
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:10,501
50 years ago,

492
00:23:10,584 --> 00:23:12,543
we met for the first time

493
00:23:12,626 --> 00:23:14,043
at a wedding banquet.

494
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,043
They served these 10 courses.

495
00:23:16,126 --> 00:23:17,501
Wow,

496
00:23:17,584 --> 00:23:19,001
first love.

497
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:22,251
So for our own wedding,

498
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,918
we want to have the same courses.

499
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:27,668
It was the best food I have ever had.

500
00:23:27,751 --> 00:23:29,543
The catering master for that banquet was

501
00:23:29,626 --> 00:23:30,376
was...

502
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:32,084
...Master Tiger Nose.

503
00:23:32,168 --> 00:23:33,793
We heard that he retired

504
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:36,043
and passed his skills onto an apprentice

505
00:23:36,126 --> 00:23:37,918
named Master Fly Spirit.

506
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,168
Sorry.

507
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:41,001
But

508
00:23:41,084 --> 00:23:42,418
Master Fly Spirit passed away.

509
00:23:42,501 --> 00:23:43,543
Huh?

510
00:23:43,626 --> 00:23:44,418
Sorry.

511
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:46,168
I should have told you earlier.

512
00:23:46,251 --> 00:23:47,793
I'm his wife.

513
00:23:48,626 --> 00:23:50,084
But

514
00:23:50,168 --> 00:23:51,668
these 10 courses you want

515
00:23:51,751 --> 00:23:53,043
I don't know how to make them.

516
00:23:53,126 --> 00:23:54,793
You don't have to make all 10 courses.

517
00:23:54,876 --> 00:23:56,418
It is okay to have just some of them.

518
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:58,709
I don't know how to make any of them.

519
00:23:59,501 --> 00:24:00,876
It's okay if we don't have a wedding.

520
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:02,543
I'm happy the way things are.

521
00:24:04,918 --> 00:24:07,043
Sorry to bother you.

522
00:24:07,126 --> 00:24:08,293
Thank you.

523
00:24:08,376 --> 00:24:09,626
Hold on.

524
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:11,709
I'll take care of the catering.

525
00:24:12,459 --> 00:24:13,543
Who are you?

526
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:15,626
I'm Master Fly Spirit's daughter.

527
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:16,876
When's the wedding?

528
00:24:17,376 --> 00:24:19,459
We haven't set a date yet.

529
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:20,376
But she says

530
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,793
if we have traditional courses

531
00:24:21,876 --> 00:24:23,751
the wedding will mean more.

532
00:24:24,626 --> 00:24:25,501
No problem.

533
00:24:25,584 --> 00:24:27,501
Uncle, give me your phone number.

534
00:24:27,918 --> 00:24:29,043
I need some time to prepare.

535
00:24:29,126 --> 00:24:31,501
I'll call you as soon as I'm ready.

536
00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:34,376
Are you sure you can handle it?

537
00:24:35,793 --> 00:24:37,626
Your happiness

538
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,418
is in my hands.

539
00:24:40,126 --> 00:24:40,876
Great.

540
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:42,084
That's great.

541
00:24:42,168 --> 00:24:43,751
This is my phone number.

542
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:44,959
Thanks again.

543
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:46,501
My pleasure.

544
00:24:46,584 --> 00:24:47,376
Thank you.

545
00:24:47,459 --> 00:24:48,918
Get ready for your wedding banquet.

546
00:24:50,626 --> 00:24:53,084
Sorry.

547
00:25:05,501 --> 00:25:07,001
Why are you all staring at me?

548
00:25:07,084 --> 00:25:09,251
Waiting to hear your plans.

549
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:12,043
I don't have any plans.

550
00:25:12,126 --> 00:25:13,376
I'm just thinking of what I can wear

551
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:14,834
to the wedding that day.

552
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:17,543
You see?

553
00:25:17,626 --> 00:25:19,043
She's a real character.

554
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:20,959
What a cute character!

555
00:25:21,043 --> 00:25:22,043
Thanks.

556
00:25:22,668 --> 00:25:24,251
Crazy.

557
00:25:24,668 --> 00:25:27,209
You promised something you can't deliver.

558
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:28,459
You might as will have promised

559
00:25:28,543 --> 00:25:30,376
that you could deliver them a baby.

560
00:25:30,793 --> 00:25:32,418
I have my dad's book of recipes.

561
00:25:32,501 --> 00:25:34,334
It must have recipes for these courses in it.

562
00:25:34,418 --> 00:25:35,334
Really?

563
00:25:35,418 --> 00:25:36,543
Why didn't you say so?

564
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:38,334
But I lost it...

565
00:25:38,668 --> 00:25:40,043
Why didn't you say so?

566
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:42,418
I once saw a website

567
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:44,959
about a Doctor Gourmet
who teaches cooking.

568
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,376
He can make almost any dish.

569
00:25:46,459 --> 00:25:47,793
Yes, yes! Call Doctor Gourmet!

570
00:25:48,709 --> 00:25:49,376
Here's the phone number.

571
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:50,793
"House Call, Catering Support,

572
00:25:50,876 --> 00:25:53,251
Solving all your Gastronomic Needs."

573
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:55,918
Sounds more like Doctor Urology to me.

574
00:25:57,376 --> 00:25:58,126
Hello.

575
00:25:58,209 --> 00:26:00,168
Hello, is this Doctor Gourmet?

576
00:26:00,918 --> 00:26:01,918
Speaking.

577
00:26:03,793 --> 00:26:05,293
Never forget your luggage.

578
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:08,126
You?

579
00:26:08,209 --> 00:26:09,834
Is the fly gone yet?

580
00:26:09,918 --> 00:26:12,001
Still there, hasn't flown away.

581
00:26:13,793 --> 00:26:14,751
You two know each other?

582
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:16,918
We've met.

583
00:26:17,251 --> 00:26:19,001
What a coincidence.

584
00:26:19,084 --> 00:26:20,501
Come in first.

585
00:26:20,584 --> 00:26:21,709
Okay.

586
00:26:21,793 --> 00:26:22,709
See you.

587
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,043
So

588
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,668
you're a chef?

589
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:29,501
Not a regular chef.

590
00:26:29,584 --> 00:26:30,876
I'm Doctor Gourmet.

591
00:26:31,668 --> 00:26:32,834
Amazing.

592
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:35,293
So, you know how to make these courses?

593
00:26:35,584 --> 00:26:36,751
Let me see.

594
00:26:39,626 --> 00:26:41,709
You have shrimp,
bamboo shoot and mushroom?

595
00:26:41,793 --> 00:26:43,668
Yes.

596
00:26:44,751 --> 00:26:45,959
Then...

597
00:26:46,043 --> 00:26:46,834
let's do it.

598
00:26:47,918 --> 00:26:49,334
Cool!

599
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:52,168
"Northern Gourmet Doctor with 16 Knives"

600
00:26:52,251 --> 00:26:53,959
is my full nickname.

601
00:26:54,043 --> 00:26:55,376
So you live in the North?

602
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:56,334
Taoyuan.

603
00:26:56,418 --> 00:26:57,668
Is Taoyuan considered the North?

604
00:26:57,751 --> 00:26:59,001
North of Taichung is considered North.

605
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,543
Welcome to the South.

606
00:27:00,876 --> 00:27:02,209
Are you going to cook?

607
00:27:02,293 --> 00:27:03,168
Yes!

608
00:27:03,251 --> 00:27:04,793
Good, hurry! Move it!

609
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,084
This way.

610
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,043
North.

611
00:28:01,376 --> 00:28:01,793
Wow.

612
00:28:01,876 --> 00:28:02,209
Wow.

613
00:28:02,376 --> 00:28:02,709
Wow.

614
00:28:02,793 --> 00:28:03,001
Wow.

615
00:28:03,084 --> 00:28:03,501
Wow.

616
00:28:03,709 --> 00:28:06,376
Wow wow wow wow wow.

617
00:28:09,626 --> 00:28:10,709
Delicious!

618
00:28:10,793 --> 00:28:11,959
Make another dish.

619
00:28:12,793 --> 00:28:13,834
I only know this one dish.

620
00:28:13,918 --> 00:28:15,084
What?

621
00:28:15,168 --> 00:28:16,376
This can't be.

622
00:28:16,459 --> 00:28:17,626
A couple's happiness is in your hands!

623
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:19,668
You know they're relying on you?

624
00:28:19,751 --> 00:28:20,293
Uh,

625
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:22,459
I thought their happiness
was in your hands?

626
00:28:22,543 --> 00:28:24,584
These are all traditional courses.

627
00:28:24,668 --> 00:28:25,501
You know that?

628
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:26,626
We know.

629
00:28:26,709 --> 00:28:29,543
They're my dad's specialties.
He's Master Fly Spirit.

630
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:32,001
Master Fly Spirit is your dad?

631
00:28:32,084 --> 00:28:33,376
He's a legend!

632
00:28:34,001 --> 00:28:35,626
But he passed away,

633
00:28:35,709 --> 00:28:37,293
and we can't make them.

634
00:28:38,251 --> 00:28:39,793
What about you, Ma'am?

635
00:28:39,876 --> 00:28:41,501
I'm all mouth and no hands.

636
00:28:41,584 --> 00:28:43,084
I have a rough idea.

637
00:28:43,168 --> 00:28:44,709
Very rough.

638
00:28:44,793 --> 00:28:46,001
I've tried these courses.

639
00:28:46,084 --> 00:28:47,959
But the taste...

640
00:28:48,043 --> 00:28:49,334
I forgot.

641
00:28:52,543 --> 00:28:54,751
I'm spending the next few days in Tainan.

642
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:55,626
How about

643
00:28:55,709 --> 00:28:57,418
I stop by and work on it everyday.

644
00:28:57,501 --> 00:28:59,209
Great! Thank you.

645
00:28:59,293 --> 00:29:00,168
You're welcome.

646
00:29:10,126 --> 00:29:16,543
Silly Girl is blowing her horn

647
00:29:16,626 --> 00:29:21,668
Do So La Si Fa

648
00:29:22,793 --> 00:29:29,001
In my hands it's so beautiful

649
00:29:29,084 --> 00:29:35,168
with a sparkling glow

650
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:45,001
I have a lovely voice

651
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:50,418
Do So La Si Fa

652
00:29:50,501 --> 00:29:54,668
Your eyes are so beautiful...

653
00:29:57,793 --> 00:30:00,459
Didn't you see us earlier?

654
00:30:00,543 --> 00:30:01,834
I didn't notice you.

655
00:30:01,918 --> 00:30:03,543
What were you singing?

656
00:30:04,376 --> 00:30:05,584
Something I wrote.

657
00:30:06,543 --> 00:30:08,209
Sounds nice.

658
00:30:08,876 --> 00:30:12,084
What course do you want to try today?

659
00:30:12,793 --> 00:30:15,209
Chrysanthemum with Bamboo
and Scallop.

660
00:30:15,293 --> 00:30:16,043
Great.

661
00:30:16,126 --> 00:30:16,918
Let's do it.

662
00:30:47,251 --> 00:30:48,376
The flavor's not right.

663
00:30:48,459 --> 00:30:48,959
Not right.

664
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:49,918
Not right.

665
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:51,168
It's off.

666
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:52,584
Think about it.

667
00:30:52,668 --> 00:30:54,126
I'm going to watch TV.

668
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:04,709
You must really like eating eggs.

669
00:31:05,334 --> 00:31:07,084
They're for something else.

670
00:31:07,501 --> 00:31:09,001
What dish is it for?

671
00:31:09,584 --> 00:31:11,168
It's called Eggs' Happiness.

672
00:31:13,043 --> 00:31:14,918
What the heck is that?

673
00:31:16,168 --> 00:31:17,793
I'll tell you a story.

674
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,084
Ming had a crush for May for a while.

675
00:31:21,168 --> 00:31:24,876
One day, Ming bravely told May.

676
00:31:25,543 --> 00:31:28,209
"May, I've liked you for a long time."

677
00:31:28,293 --> 00:31:30,418
"Can we go steady?"

678
00:31:31,501 --> 00:31:32,876
"But you're too pale."

679
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:35,168
"I don't like men that are too pale."

680
00:31:35,251 --> 00:31:37,959
May walks away without looking back.

681
00:31:38,418 --> 00:31:40,293
Ming is heart-broken.

682
00:31:40,376 --> 00:31:42,584
But he tries hard to change himself.

683
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:45,001
One day, while walking down the street,

684
00:31:45,084 --> 00:31:47,334
May hears someone calling her
from behind.

685
00:31:47,418 --> 00:31:48,501
"May!"

686
00:31:50,459 --> 00:31:51,376
"You are...?"

687
00:31:51,459 --> 00:31:53,709
"I'm Ming."

688
00:31:54,668 --> 00:31:58,168
"I've tanned in Kenting
for a week for you."

689
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:00,501
"Do you like it?"

690
00:32:02,334 --> 00:32:03,709
"You're very handsome."

691
00:32:03,793 --> 00:32:06,001
"Now you're just my type."

692
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:09,751
They start going steady,

693
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:10,918
get married,

694
00:32:11,001 --> 00:32:13,668
and live happily ever after.

695
00:32:14,126 --> 00:32:14,918
Then...

696
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:16,584
it's not over yet?

697
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:18,876
And then they have a baby tea egg.

698
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:24,251
Who on earth told you this story?

699
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:26,459
I made it up myself.

700
00:32:26,751 --> 00:32:28,376
Very creative.

701
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:37,501
(Stylish New Dish: Eggs' Happiness)

702
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:41,918
Hi, handsome.

703
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,501
Come have some noodle.

704
00:32:43,584 --> 00:32:45,126
Come have some noodle.

705
00:32:45,209 --> 00:32:47,334
We have noodles and rice.

706
00:33:10,584 --> 00:33:12,209
So flavorful and flaky.

707
00:33:14,168 --> 00:33:14,543
This is

708
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:15,668
like a scorching desert

709
00:33:15,751 --> 00:33:17,793
drenched in spring rain.

710
00:33:17,876 --> 00:33:19,209
Nice description.

711
00:33:19,293 --> 00:33:20,501
Really?

712
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:21,876
I've never had this.

713
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:23,043
What's it called?

714
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,584
I don't have a name for it yet.

715
00:33:25,543 --> 00:33:28,001
Lotus, Cilantro, Chinese yam...

716
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:30,001
Lotus...Yam...Lo...Ya

717
00:33:30,084 --> 00:33:31,209
Lo Ya...Loving Ya.

718
00:33:31,751 --> 00:33:33,209
"Loving Ya", it is!

719
00:33:36,543 --> 00:33:37,418
Beautiful!

720
00:33:37,501 --> 00:33:38,459
Nice!

721
00:33:45,459 --> 00:33:46,626
Hello.

722
00:33:47,543 --> 00:33:49,418
Uncle, how are you?

723
00:33:49,501 --> 00:33:50,834
Almost there.

724
00:33:50,918 --> 00:33:52,709
Working on 2 more courses.

725
00:33:52,793 --> 00:33:54,126
I guarantee it will be great.

726
00:33:54,209 --> 00:33:56,834
Let you have " Yesterday Once More "
all the way

727
00:33:57,501 --> 00:33:58,293
Great!

728
00:33:58,376 --> 00:34:00,209
We'll let you know when they're ready.

729
00:34:00,668 --> 00:34:01,168
Okay.

730
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:03,168
Okay okay.

731
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,751
The old uncle just called.

732
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:08,043
That was a nice response.

733
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:09,376
Nice my ass!

734
00:34:09,459 --> 00:34:10,584
What should we do now?

735
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:13,418
Was Master Fly Spirit their caterer?

736
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:15,584
No, her dad wasn't that old.

737
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:18,293
It was his master, Master Tiger Nose.

738
00:34:18,376 --> 00:34:19,251
Master Tiger Nose!

739
00:34:19,334 --> 00:34:20,376
Yes.

740
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:22,126
He knows every recipe in the world.

741
00:34:22,209 --> 00:34:24,418
He must know all the traditional courses.

742
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:26,459
Right!

743
00:34:26,543 --> 00:34:28,959
I wonder what he's doing now?

744
00:34:35,709 --> 00:34:37,126
Master!

745
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:40,251
I haven't seen you in so long!

746
00:34:40,334 --> 00:34:41,376
How are you?

747
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:44,668
Hsia, did you miss me?

748
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:46,209
Hsia again?

749
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:47,418
Miss,

750
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:49,168
hurry and get my bottle of Cognac.

751
00:34:49,751 --> 00:34:51,293
All right,

752
00:34:51,376 --> 00:34:54,043
let's have a drink first.

753
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:55,334
Drink first.

754
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:56,668
After a drink,

755
00:34:56,751 --> 00:34:57,709
I'll take you out for some fun.

756
00:34:57,793 --> 00:34:59,584
I don't want to go out.

757
00:34:59,668 --> 00:35:01,459
I just want to ask you

758
00:35:01,543 --> 00:35:03,584
if you know any good traditional dishes

759
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:05,168
that you can teach us?

760
00:35:05,251 --> 00:35:07,126
Sure, I can teach you how to dance!

761
00:35:07,209 --> 00:35:08,918
I'll take both of you.

762
00:35:12,834 --> 00:35:15,001
What's wrong with him?

763
00:35:16,168 --> 00:35:17,376
Let me try.

764
00:35:17,459 --> 00:35:19,209
Okay, you're in show business.

765
00:35:21,376 --> 00:35:23,001
Master Tiger Nose,

766
00:35:23,084 --> 00:35:24,168
I can be your

767
00:35:24,251 --> 00:35:25,876
new girl.

768
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:28,876
Very cute, very cute.

769
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:29,709
Hurry,

770
00:35:29,793 --> 00:35:31,418
bring out the 25-year-old bottle.

771
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:33,168
That's okay!

772
00:35:33,459 --> 00:35:34,584
Master Tiger Nose,

773
00:35:34,668 --> 00:35:36,918
I'm so hungry right now.

774
00:35:37,459 --> 00:35:38,209
Why didn't you say so?

775
00:35:38,293 --> 00:35:39,793
I'll cook for you.

776
00:35:39,876 --> 00:35:41,376
Good, good.

777
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:43,668
I want to eat your

778
00:35:43,751 --> 00:35:46,251
most famous dish.

779
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:47,376
No problem.

780
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:48,626
Rosemary!

781
00:35:48,709 --> 00:35:49,709
Fried Rice Noodle!

782
00:35:50,209 --> 00:35:51,501
Fried Rice Noodle?

783
00:36:14,584 --> 00:36:15,251
Master,

784
00:36:15,334 --> 00:36:17,376
is this your most famous dish?
Anything else?

785
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:18,376
Brother Tiger Nose!

786
00:36:18,459 --> 00:36:20,251
Any more famous dishes?

787
00:36:24,376 --> 00:36:25,334
Who are you?

788
00:36:25,418 --> 00:36:27,584
I'm your new girl.

789
00:36:28,293 --> 00:36:30,001
New girl?

790
00:36:31,876 --> 00:36:33,334
Then who am I?

791
00:36:33,834 --> 00:36:36,209
Damn,

792
00:36:36,293 --> 00:36:38,376
what happened to him?

793
00:36:38,668 --> 00:36:40,001
Grandpa is tired.

794
00:37:00,793 --> 00:37:02,918
Too good!

795
00:37:04,584 --> 00:37:06,334
How can it taste so good?

796
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:09,501
Rice noodles are made from rice

797
00:37:10,543 --> 00:37:14,001
but it's turned into something better.

798
00:37:14,084 --> 00:37:17,084
Rice would be so proud to see

799
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,084
what rice noodles have become.

800
00:37:20,293 --> 00:37:22,126
This is the best Fried Rice Noodle.

801
00:37:23,543 --> 00:37:25,918
This is really the best Fried Rice Noodle!

802
00:37:30,126 --> 00:37:31,959
Ma'am,

803
00:37:32,043 --> 00:37:34,709
tomorrow I'm catering for a councilman
at his house.

804
00:37:34,793 --> 00:37:37,126
His guest requested Fried Rice Noodle.

805
00:37:37,209 --> 00:37:39,709
Can you go and make it for them?

806
00:37:50,209 --> 00:37:51,668
Hello, Chairman Hsu.

807
00:37:52,418 --> 00:37:55,293
The chef today is very famous.

808
00:37:55,376 --> 00:37:57,751
He often helps out at big restaurants.

809
00:37:59,251 --> 00:38:00,501
Miss,

810
00:38:00,584 --> 00:38:01,876
is the Fried Rice Noodle ready?

811
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:04,418
Chairman Hsu loves to eat
Fried Rice Noodle.

812
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:05,584
Coming right up.

813
00:38:05,876 --> 00:38:07,418
Here comes the Fried Rice Noodle.

814
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:13,043
Puffy!

815
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:14,834
What the hell are you doing here?

816
00:38:17,001 --> 00:38:18,168
What's wrong?

817
00:38:18,251 --> 00:38:19,834
She catered for me last time.

818
00:38:19,918 --> 00:38:22,668
The food she made was inedible.

819
00:38:22,751 --> 00:38:24,876
She humiliated me.

820
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:25,959
Don't worry!

821
00:38:26,043 --> 00:38:28,959
She's not the catering master today!

822
00:38:29,293 --> 00:38:32,001
She made the Fried Rice Noodle though.

823
00:38:32,084 --> 00:38:33,126
What?

824
00:38:33,209 --> 00:38:35,293
Chairman Hsu, you'd better not touch it.

825
00:38:35,376 --> 00:38:37,001
Or else you'll get a stomachache.

826
00:38:37,959 --> 00:38:39,501
I want to try it.

827
00:38:39,876 --> 00:38:41,126
Here.

828
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:42,418
Let me serve you.

829
00:38:45,168 --> 00:38:46,209
Please.

830
00:39:00,126 --> 00:39:02,084
(Back-Site Station)

831
00:39:02,668 --> 00:39:04,668
50 years ago,

832
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:06,918
I left with Hsiung to Taipei for a new start.

833
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:14,001
Hsiung.

834
00:39:15,084 --> 00:39:16,209
What are you doing here?

835
00:39:16,293 --> 00:39:17,376
Nothing.

836
00:39:17,459 --> 00:39:18,709
I made this for you.

837
00:39:18,793 --> 00:39:20,793
To eat on the road.

838
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:22,293
All right!

839
00:39:22,376 --> 00:39:23,376
Hurry home now!

840
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:26,293
You can have it.

841
00:39:29,126 --> 00:39:30,459
I've eaten so much I'm sick of it.

842
00:39:33,168 --> 00:39:35,168
After that, every time I went home

843
00:39:35,251 --> 00:39:36,834
she asked me to take Fried Rice Noodle

844
00:39:36,918 --> 00:39:38,626
to Hsiung.

845
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,126
Hsu,

846
00:39:42,626 --> 00:39:44,668
give this to Hsiung for me.

847
00:39:45,459 --> 00:39:47,793
Actually,
I ate all the Fried Rice Noodle myself.

848
00:39:47,876 --> 00:39:50,543
Hsiung already had another girl in Taipei

849
00:39:50,626 --> 00:39:53,001
and had forgotten about her.

850
00:39:53,918 --> 00:39:56,043
This went on for a year

851
00:39:56,126 --> 00:39:59,043
before I completely lost touch with her.

852
00:40:00,834 --> 00:40:04,793
I heard she went to
Taipei looking for Hsiung.

853
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:18,709
Though Hsia never made
Fried Rice Noodle for me,

854
00:40:18,793 --> 00:40:22,126
I could never forget this flavor.

855
00:40:23,001 --> 00:40:24,126
Hsia?

856
00:40:24,376 --> 00:40:26,084
Ever since then, I've never had

857
00:40:26,168 --> 00:40:29,751
Fried Rice Noodle this good again.

858
00:40:30,709 --> 00:40:31,834
Thank you so much.

859
00:40:33,001 --> 00:40:33,918
See!

860
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:36,751
I told you she's a great catering master.

861
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:39,418
You make wonderful food.

862
00:40:39,501 --> 00:40:42,876
You should enter the
National Catering Contest.

863
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:45,001
National Catering Contest?

864
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:46,918
The government's putting it on.

865
00:40:47,001 --> 00:40:49,293
I'm a consultant and sponsor.

866
00:40:49,376 --> 00:40:52,459
First place wins 1 million.

867
00:40:52,709 --> 00:40:54,459
1 million?

868
00:40:56,376 --> 00:40:57,418
It's 1 million!

869
00:40:57,501 --> 00:40:59,459
We should sign up for it.

870
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:02,251
It's not a contest for
best Fried Rice Noodle.

871
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:05,584
Ma'am.

872
00:41:05,876 --> 00:41:06,959
What are you doing here now?

873
00:41:07,043 --> 00:41:08,751
I'd like to borrow your scooter.

874
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:10,501
Picking up some chicks?

875
00:41:11,918 --> 00:41:12,959
You missed.

876
00:41:15,251 --> 00:41:17,001
Let me take you somewhere.

877
00:41:17,084 --> 00:41:18,834
Oh, okay.

878
00:41:18,918 --> 00:41:20,793
So I guess you're the chick?

879
00:41:20,876 --> 00:41:21,584
Shut up.

880
00:41:21,668 --> 00:41:24,668
Pour it from the side.

881
00:41:24,751 --> 00:41:25,876
Got it?

882
00:41:25,959 --> 00:41:27,334
It;ll taste better.

883
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:30,876
It's really good.

884
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:31,543
Good?

885
00:41:31,626 --> 00:41:32,418
Really good.

886
00:41:32,501 --> 00:41:33,501
My kids

887
00:41:33,584 --> 00:41:35,168
will eat three bowls of rice

888
00:41:35,251 --> 00:41:36,543
when I make this dish.

889
00:41:37,501 --> 00:41:38,543
My Slacker

890
00:41:38,626 --> 00:41:40,209
really enjoys going out.

891
00:41:40,293 --> 00:41:41,334
Maybe the two of them are out

892
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:42,543
fooling around.

893
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:43,668
Fooling around?

894
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:44,834
Not a chance.

895
00:41:44,918 --> 00:41:46,001
She said a long time ago:

896
00:41:46,084 --> 00:41:47,751
"I will never marry a chef."

897
00:41:47,834 --> 00:41:50,251
He's not a chef, he's a doctor.

898
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:36,959
Sir,

899
00:42:37,043 --> 00:42:38,876
what would you like to have?

900
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:40,334
What's that?

901
00:42:42,043 --> 00:42:44,376
Eggs' Happiness.

902
00:42:44,459 --> 00:42:45,793
It's our specialty.

903
00:42:47,376 --> 00:42:48,251
Your specialty?

904
00:42:48,334 --> 00:42:49,293
Yes.

905
00:42:51,626 --> 00:42:53,168
I'll try it.

906
00:42:54,168 --> 00:42:55,168
Coming right up.

907
00:43:10,876 --> 00:43:12,293
How much?

908
00:43:14,251 --> 00:43:15,251
50.

909
00:43:33,001 --> 00:43:34,876
This dish was once called

910
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:36,543
Eggs' Dilemma.

911
00:43:56,084 --> 00:43:56,793
Right here

912
00:43:56,876 --> 00:43:58,959
is where the canal bends.

913
00:43:59,043 --> 00:44:00,126
This bridge

914
00:44:00,209 --> 00:44:02,251
is the "New Lin An Bridge".

915
00:44:02,334 --> 00:44:05,084
This one is the "Jing Hua Bridge".

916
00:44:05,168 --> 00:44:06,209
These two bridges are close,

917
00:44:06,293 --> 00:44:08,043
but can't see each other.

918
00:44:08,126 --> 00:44:10,793
The fish around here are very nosy.

919
00:44:10,876 --> 00:44:13,876
They'll jump out of water to eavesdrop.

920
00:44:13,959 --> 00:44:16,168
When the bridges
need to talk to each other,

921
00:44:16,251 --> 00:44:17,959
they ask fish to help them.

922
00:44:18,043 --> 00:44:20,293
To bridge the gap.

923
00:44:20,376 --> 00:44:21,626
So, when people need to communicate,

924
00:44:21,709 --> 00:44:22,626
we say:

925
00:44:22,709 --> 00:44:24,126
"Let's bridge the gap."

926
00:44:25,126 --> 00:44:26,918
You made this up yourself?

927
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:29,459
I didn't have playmates when I was a kid

928
00:44:29,543 --> 00:44:31,209
so I made up stories for fun.

929
00:44:31,584 --> 00:44:32,876
Really?

930
00:44:32,959 --> 00:44:34,251
I put a box over my head.

931
00:44:34,334 --> 00:44:35,126
And then

932
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:37,834
I can enter a whole other world.

933
00:44:38,459 --> 00:44:40,209
That's awesome!

934
00:44:40,293 --> 00:44:42,251
I'll try it too next time.

935
00:44:43,001 --> 00:44:44,543
Why are you so obsessed with

936
00:44:44,626 --> 00:44:46,043
making Scrambled Tomato and Eggs?

937
00:44:46,126 --> 00:44:47,501
Isn't it all the same?

938
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:49,251
Not at all.

939
00:44:50,209 --> 00:44:52,168
It's easy to make the dish

940
00:44:52,251 --> 00:44:54,668
but every mother has her own take on it.

941
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:57,459
You chefs are all the same.

942
00:44:57,543 --> 00:44:58,709
My dad too.

943
00:44:58,793 --> 00:45:01,043
All he cared about was
what his customers liked.

944
00:45:01,126 --> 00:45:03,584
But never about what I would like.

945
00:45:04,918 --> 00:45:06,209
You're Master Fly Spirit's daughter.

946
00:45:06,293 --> 00:45:07,959
How can you say that?

947
00:45:08,043 --> 00:45:10,793
Cooking means something.

948
00:45:10,876 --> 00:45:12,334
And what's that?

949
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,501
Even if you make 1000 types
of Scrambled Tomato and Eggs?

950
00:45:14,584 --> 00:45:15,209
So what?

951
00:45:15,293 --> 00:45:16,834
What purpose would it give to your life?

952
00:45:16,918 --> 00:45:18,793
I don't expect it to give me a purpose.

953
00:45:18,876 --> 00:45:19,709
Those were my cellmates

954
00:45:19,793 --> 00:45:21,376
who missed their mother's cooking.

955
00:45:21,459 --> 00:45:22,834
Even convicted felons

956
00:45:22,918 --> 00:45:24,334
miss the flavor of their mother's food.

957
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:38,709
Yes.

958
00:45:39,334 --> 00:45:40,834
I've been in prison.

959
00:45:43,293 --> 00:45:44,293
Now you must want to ask me

960
00:45:44,376 --> 00:45:46,251
why I was in prison.

961
00:45:47,626 --> 00:45:48,834
Not really.

962
00:45:56,001 --> 00:45:58,584
(Fish: Bridging the gap?)

963
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:11,043
I've got to go.

964
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:39,293
You want to scare me to death?

965
00:46:40,376 --> 00:46:41,876
I'll tell you!

966
00:46:41,959 --> 00:46:43,334
Sit down!

967
00:46:43,418 --> 00:46:45,043
I saw a ghost today.

968
00:46:45,126 --> 00:46:46,501
What are you talking about?

969
00:46:46,584 --> 00:46:48,001
Master Ghost Head!

970
00:46:48,084 --> 00:46:48,876
He was in our restaurant

971
00:46:48,959 --> 00:46:50,459
to try Eggs' Happiness.

972
00:46:50,876 --> 00:46:52,459
Who's Master Ghost Head?

973
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:53,876
You've never heard of him?

974
00:46:53,959 --> 00:46:54,918
20 years ago

975
00:46:55,001 --> 00:46:56,834
there were 3 famous Catering Masters.

976
00:46:56,918 --> 00:46:57,751
"Mortal" in the North,

977
00:46:57,834 --> 00:46:58,709
"Ghost;' in the Central,

978
00:46:58,793 --> 00:46:59,959
and "Spirit;' in the South.

979
00:47:00,043 --> 00:47:01,418
Your dad is the Spirit,

980
00:47:01,501 --> 00:47:03,251
Master Fly Spirit.

981
00:47:03,334 --> 00:47:04,043
Oh!

982
00:47:04,126 --> 00:47:06,668
Master Ghost Head is the Ghost.

983
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:09,126
He was a big-time gangster.

984
00:47:10,084 --> 00:47:11,959
A gangster who loves to cook?

985
00:47:12,043 --> 00:47:13,251
Yes!

986
00:47:13,334 --> 00:47:15,209
He later went to prison

987
00:47:15,293 --> 00:47:16,584
for murder.

988
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:17,793
Really?

989
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,668
Why did he kill someone?

990
00:47:19,751 --> 00:47:21,543
One time,

991
00:47:21,626 --> 00:47:23,918
some thugs disrupted a banquet.

992
00:47:24,334 --> 00:47:26,251
It was a scary scene.

993
00:47:26,334 --> 00:47:27,126
Screw you!

994
00:47:27,209 --> 00:47:28,543
The food sucks!

995
00:47:28,793 --> 00:47:30,376
I'm going to flip this table!

996
00:47:30,459 --> 00:47:31,459
Listen,

997
00:47:31,543 --> 00:47:33,376
Ghost Head is the catering master today.

998
00:47:33,459 --> 00:47:34,626
He made this food.

999
00:47:34,709 --> 00:47:36,001
You dare to flip the table?

1000
00:47:36,084 --> 00:47:37,418
Ghost Head?

1001
00:47:38,418 --> 00:47:40,626
Ghost Head can kiss my ass!

1002
00:48:06,376 --> 00:48:08,668
If you don't like it, don't eat it.

1003
00:48:08,751 --> 00:48:10,418
Who did this?

1004
00:48:10,501 --> 00:48:12,251
I did! I'm the man!

1005
00:48:13,209 --> 00:48:14,918
And I've flipped every table in Taiwan.

1006
00:48:15,709 --> 00:48:16,834
(Ghost Head's Knife)

1007
00:48:16,918 --> 00:48:17,834
(AKA: The Bonecutter)

1008
00:48:17,918 --> 00:48:19,209
(215 pigs, 2487 chickens)

1009
00:48:19,293 --> 00:48:20,334
(1694 cow bones)

1010
00:48:20,418 --> 00:48:21,668
(infinite vegetables and fish)

1011
00:48:22,251 --> 00:48:23,501
(Crispy Roast Duck)

1012
00:48:23,584 --> 00:48:25,043
(Crispy and juicy)

1013
00:48:33,876 --> 00:48:35,251
That is scary.

1014
00:48:36,209 --> 00:48:38,626
I tried his food one time.

1015
00:48:38,709 --> 00:48:41,043
He had some crazy ideas in his head.

1016
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,543
His flavors were so unique.

1017
00:48:43,626 --> 00:48:45,834
And his carving and chopping so precise.

1018
00:48:46,626 --> 00:48:48,126
How did you get to try his food?

1019
00:48:48,626 --> 00:48:50,876
He took offense of your dad's

1020
00:48:50,959 --> 00:48:51,918
"Spirit;' Title.

1021
00:48:52,001 --> 00:48:53,501
And challenged him one time.

1022
00:48:54,209 --> 00:48:55,293
Who won?

1023
00:48:55,376 --> 00:48:56,918
Your dad did of course.

1024
00:48:57,001 --> 00:48:57,793
WC.

1025
00:48:57,876 --> 00:48:59,709
But he still wasn't convinced.

1026
00:49:01,293 --> 00:49:03,043
I heard

1027
00:49:03,126 --> 00:49:04,709
that his cooking turned odd.

1028
00:49:04,793 --> 00:49:06,793
And his temper got even worse.

1029
00:49:08,334 --> 00:49:09,959
How about "Mortal" in the North?

1030
00:49:10,043 --> 00:49:12,084
You mean Master Silly Mortal?

1031
00:49:12,168 --> 00:49:15,001
I've never met him or tried his food.

1032
00:49:15,084 --> 00:49:17,251
But I heard he was very eccentric.

1033
00:49:17,334 --> 00:49:19,834
He refused to cater for

1034
00:49:19,918 --> 00:49:21,293
the rich or powerful.

1035
00:49:21,376 --> 00:49:22,668
That's why everyone

1036
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,459
called him Master Silly Mortal.

1037
00:49:25,543 --> 00:49:27,084
They said eating his food

1038
00:49:27,168 --> 00:49:29,126
would trigger feelings

1039
00:49:29,209 --> 00:49:30,709
of being human.

1040
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:33,376
Feelings of being human?

1041
00:49:33,459 --> 00:49:34,543
What does it mean?

1042
00:49:35,668 --> 00:49:37,334
I guess it means...

1043
00:49:39,043 --> 00:49:40,418
at least you're not a deg.

1044
00:49:43,668 --> 00:49:44,876
Hai.

1045
00:49:52,126 --> 00:49:53,376
Master,

1046
00:49:55,043 --> 00:49:56,543
why are you out?

1047
00:50:00,293 --> 00:50:03,251
Master, whose house is this?

1048
00:50:05,459 --> 00:50:07,168
Tsai's old home.

1049
00:50:07,251 --> 00:50:08,334
Tsai?

1050
00:50:09,168 --> 00:50:11,209
Apprentice of Master Fly Spirit.

1051
00:50:14,459 --> 00:50:16,626
He's worried he doesn't have it anymore.

1052
00:50:16,709 --> 00:50:18,543
He asked me to be his secret weapon.

1053
00:50:19,834 --> 00:50:21,334
Secret weapon for what?

1054
00:50:21,751 --> 00:50:23,501
For this catering contest.

1055
00:50:23,584 --> 00:50:24,584
Nonsense.

1056
00:50:26,584 --> 00:50:28,418
But why are you helping him?

1057
00:50:33,209 --> 00:50:35,209
After you got out of prison,

1058
00:50:35,709 --> 00:50:37,626
I've been trying to create a dish

1059
00:50:38,126 --> 00:50:40,418
that combines all my ideas

1060
00:50:40,501 --> 00:50:42,501
from the last 30 years.

1061
00:50:42,584 --> 00:50:44,418
I've figured it out now.

1062
00:50:44,501 --> 00:50:46,084
You have to help me though.

1063
00:50:47,168 --> 00:50:48,793
Sure.

1064
00:50:48,876 --> 00:50:50,334
What do you need?

1065
00:50:51,251 --> 00:50:53,584
Be my tongue and hands.

1066
00:50:54,459 --> 00:50:55,501
Be your what?

1067
00:50:55,584 --> 00:50:57,168
My taste buds have all gone bad.

1068
00:50:57,251 --> 00:50:59,876
My tongue can't distinguish
different flavors.

1069
00:51:02,584 --> 00:51:03,918
So

1070
00:51:04,001 --> 00:51:06,709
you're making a special dish
for the contest?

1071
00:51:10,334 --> 00:51:12,459
This will probably be my final dish.

1072
00:51:19,459 --> 00:51:20,709
Master.

1073
00:51:21,626 --> 00:51:23,793
Why don't you just compete

1074
00:51:23,876 --> 00:51:25,543
instead of helping him?

1075
00:51:29,959 --> 00:51:32,084
I'd rather be a ghost with no name.

1076
00:51:34,959 --> 00:51:36,001
Okay! Start!

1077
00:51:47,751 --> 00:51:50,293
Try yours first, then mine.

1078
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:03,001
Master,

1079
00:52:03,084 --> 00:52:05,251
yours tastes much better.

1080
00:52:05,334 --> 00:52:07,334
We made fish paste the same way.

1081
00:52:07,418 --> 00:52:09,043
Why are the flavors so different?

1082
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,501
Your fish was full of grief.

1083
00:52:14,084 --> 00:52:15,793
You think it gave up its life willingly?

1084
00:52:16,668 --> 00:52:17,668
It's not happy.

1085
00:52:17,751 --> 00:52:19,334
Be serious.

1086
00:52:24,626 --> 00:52:26,084
How about this piece of meat?

1087
00:52:26,168 --> 00:52:27,251
Not willingly.

1088
00:52:30,876 --> 00:52:33,793
Because they died unwillingly,

1089
00:52:33,876 --> 00:52:35,501
the meat is full of grief.

1090
00:52:37,084 --> 00:52:38,376
What can we do about it?

1091
00:52:38,459 --> 00:52:40,376
Depends on how you butcher it.

1092
00:52:40,459 --> 00:52:42,584
You can remove the grief.

1093
00:52:42,668 --> 00:52:44,251
How do I do that?

1094
00:52:45,376 --> 00:52:47,293
With your heart.

1095
00:52:48,501 --> 00:52:50,084
And your knife.

1096
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:51,418
The speed of chopping can

1097
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,334
determine the amount of grief.

1098
00:52:55,668 --> 00:52:57,584
Master, are you joking?

1099
00:52:57,668 --> 00:52:59,751
Even if it were a joke,

1100
00:52:59,834 --> 00:53:02,418
it's the last joke you'll hear from me.

1101
00:53:04,418 --> 00:53:05,834
Let me chop again for you to see.

1102
00:53:21,376 --> 00:53:22,501
See the difference?

1103
00:53:27,418 --> 00:53:28,668
I have an idea.

1104
00:53:28,751 --> 00:53:31,959
Let's enter the contest
with the traditional courses.

1105
00:53:32,043 --> 00:53:33,209
We can kill two birds

1106
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,543
with one stone.

1107
00:53:36,126 --> 00:53:38,043
That's right!

1108
00:53:38,126 --> 00:53:39,751
Can we win though?

1109
00:53:39,834 --> 00:53:42,293
Think positive.

1110
00:53:42,376 --> 00:53:44,793
What if we win?

1111
00:53:44,876 --> 00:53:46,084
It;ll be wonderful!

1112
00:53:46,376 --> 00:53:48,126
Bring home 1 million.

1113
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:49,251
Yes!

1114
00:53:49,334 --> 00:53:50,709
It's nice to have a dream.

1115
00:53:50,793 --> 00:53:52,834
Even better to have the money.

1116
00:53:53,293 --> 00:53:55,418
Surprise!

1117
00:53:56,543 --> 00:53:57,293
Come have a seat.

1118
00:53:57,376 --> 00:53:59,168
Miss Wan,

1119
00:53:59,709 --> 00:54:01,501
long time no see.

1120
00:54:02,543 --> 00:54:03,501
Ma'am.

1121
00:54:03,584 --> 00:54:04,709
Do you want some noodles?

1122
00:54:04,793 --> 00:54:06,251
Take a look at this.

1123
00:54:06,334 --> 00:54:07,834
Your daughter signed it.

1124
00:54:08,793 --> 00:54:09,501
I'm starving.

1125
00:54:09,584 --> 00:54:11,293
How about a bowl of noodles?

1126
00:54:12,876 --> 00:54:14,251
9 million?

1127
00:54:15,459 --> 00:54:16,959
I thought you said 900 thousand.

1128
00:54:17,626 --> 00:54:18,501
What's the difference?

1129
00:54:18,584 --> 00:54:20,543
I can't pay any of it.

1130
00:54:20,959 --> 00:54:22,251
You can't pay it back?

1131
00:54:22,334 --> 00:54:23,459
You know what happens

1132
00:54:23,543 --> 00:54:25,584
if you don't pay?

1133
00:54:25,918 --> 00:54:27,334
What?

1134
00:54:27,418 --> 00:54:28,084
For example:

1135
00:54:28,168 --> 00:54:29,459
You get hit by a oar.

1136
00:54:29,543 --> 00:54:31,084
A billboard falls on you.

1137
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:34,126
Some strangers beat you up for no reason.

1138
00:54:34,209 --> 00:54:36,418
You can't find your remote
while watching TV.

1139
00:54:37,584 --> 00:54:39,334
Hey hey hey.

1140
00:54:40,876 --> 00:54:42,959
It's not a big deal.

1141
00:54:43,043 --> 00:54:45,001
We'll pay you back.

1142
00:54:45,084 --> 00:54:47,668
But you need to give us more time.

1143
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:49,209
How much longer?

1144
00:54:49,293 --> 00:54:50,334
Not much.

1145
00:54:50,418 --> 00:54:53,584
We're entering
the National Catering Contest.

1146
00:54:53,668 --> 00:54:54,834
If we win

1147
00:54:54,918 --> 00:54:56,584
first prize is 1 million.

1148
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,834
That's not enough.

1149
00:54:58,918 --> 00:55:00,043
Why not?

1150
00:55:00,126 --> 00:55:01,084
Once we're famous,

1151
00:55:01,168 --> 00:55:02,293
everyone will want us to cater for them.

1152
00:55:02,376 --> 00:55:03,376
We'll make lots of money.

1153
00:55:03,459 --> 00:55:06,001
And with all that money
we can pay you back.

1154
00:55:06,084 --> 00:55:06,709
Sit down!

1155
00:55:07,751 --> 00:55:10,501
This contest had better be real.

1156
00:55:11,043 --> 00:55:13,418
You can check online! Go ahead!

1157
00:55:13,501 --> 00:55:15,543
I will.

1158
00:55:17,209 --> 00:55:18,418
Afterwards,

1159
00:55:18,501 --> 00:55:20,293
when I'm famous.

1160
00:55:20,376 --> 00:55:22,501
I'll get to host TV shows.

1161
00:55:22,584 --> 00:55:25,043
And even shoot commercials.

1162
00:55:25,751 --> 00:55:26,959
Really!

1163
00:55:27,043 --> 00:55:30,501
You sure you can win?

1164
00:55:34,418 --> 00:55:36,251
You don't sound like a pro.

1165
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,751
Have you ever heard of the caterer

1166
00:55:39,834 --> 00:55:41,126
Master Fly Spirit?

1167
00:55:42,418 --> 00:55:43,709
Have you?

1168
00:55:44,459 --> 00:55:46,709
He was her dad, my husband.

1169
00:55:46,793 --> 00:55:47,876
Chairman Hsu?

1170
00:55:47,959 --> 00:55:49,459
How about him?

1171
00:55:49,543 --> 00:55:51,376
He asked us to compete in the contest.

1172
00:55:51,459 --> 00:55:54,376
I have very strong support.

1173
00:55:55,376 --> 00:55:58,501
What happens if you lose?

1174
00:55:58,584 --> 00:55:59,834
Let's bet then!

1175
00:55:59,918 --> 00:56:01,501
Don't just watch from the sidelines.

1176
00:56:03,459 --> 00:56:04,626
Hey hey hey.

1177
00:56:05,876 --> 00:56:07,001
Okay!

1178
00:56:07,293 --> 00:56:09,251
If you win,

1179
00:56:09,334 --> 00:56:11,418
you give me the 1 million right away.

1180
00:56:13,084 --> 00:56:14,251
No problem.

1181
00:56:14,334 --> 00:56:15,501
I have a question though.

1182
00:56:15,584 --> 00:56:16,626
You're full of questions.

1183
00:56:16,709 --> 00:56:18,709
How did you find us here?

1184
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:21,293
Your neighbor's wife told us.

1185
00:56:23,668 --> 00:56:25,793
The preliminary contest starts in 3 days.

1186
00:56:25,876 --> 00:56:26,959
Just 3 days?

1187
00:56:27,043 --> 00:56:28,376
Okay!

1188
00:56:28,459 --> 00:56:29,793
Alright!

1189
00:56:30,334 --> 00:56:32,584
From now on, we're inseparable.

1190
00:56:32,668 --> 00:56:35,084
We leave for Taipei tomorrow morning.

1191
00:56:35,168 --> 00:56:36,501
Wait...leave for Taipei?

1192
00:56:36,584 --> 00:56:38,209
Where will we stay in Taipei?

1193
00:56:38,293 --> 00:56:40,918
Taipei's expensive,
let's crash at Miss Wan's place.

1194
00:56:41,001 --> 00:56:41,918
I don't think we can.

1195
00:56:42,001 --> 00:56:44,168
The landlord
probably rented it out already.

1196
00:56:44,251 --> 00:56:45,626
What should we do?

1197
00:56:45,709 --> 00:56:47,001
What should we do?

1198
00:56:47,084 --> 00:56:49,001
We can ask Animals on Call.

1199
00:56:49,084 --> 00:56:50,251
Who?

1200
00:56:50,334 --> 00:56:51,709
Animals on Call.

1201
00:56:51,793 --> 00:56:53,668
But I need to stop by home first.

1202
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,334
Damn,

1203
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:04,543
the electricity's off.

1204
00:57:05,293 --> 00:57:06,918
Stop shining that at me.

1205
00:57:07,001 --> 00:57:08,376
Why do you carry flashlights with you?

1206
00:57:08,459 --> 00:57:10,084
That's what pros do.

1207
00:57:10,168 --> 00:57:11,459
Hey hey hey.

1208
00:57:11,543 --> 00:57:12,251
Hey what?

1209
00:57:12,334 --> 00:57:13,168
Here.

1210
00:57:14,793 --> 00:57:16,209
It's dark.

1211
00:57:16,293 --> 00:57:17,209
Here.

1212
00:57:17,293 --> 00:57:18,001
Help me carry this.

1213
00:57:18,084 --> 00:57:19,251
Okay okay.

1214
00:57:20,543 --> 00:57:21,751
Serious stuff.

1215
00:57:23,834 --> 00:57:25,043
What are you looking for?

1216
00:57:32,418 --> 00:57:33,876
Hubby,

1217
00:57:33,959 --> 00:57:35,084
your daughter and I

1218
00:57:35,168 --> 00:57:37,334
will make you shine again.

1219
00:57:37,418 --> 00:57:40,251
Bless us so we can win this contest.

1220
00:57:40,501 --> 00:57:42,251
Turn the ignition, stop on the gas.

1221
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:42,918
Come on.

1222
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:45,084
No, just stop on it.

1223
00:57:45,168 --> 00:57:47,293
Do you know what you're doing?

1224
00:57:47,376 --> 00:57:48,459
Go.

1225
00:57:48,834 --> 00:57:50,084
Harder.

1226
00:57:51,126 --> 00:57:52,543
It's on! it's on!

1227
00:57:52,626 --> 00:57:53,834
This van can still move.

1228
00:57:53,918 --> 00:57:56,501
Nice, it's still got it.

1229
00:58:07,209 --> 00:58:08,459
Up so early?

1230
00:58:08,959 --> 00:58:10,376
We haven't gone to sleep yet.

1231
00:58:10,459 --> 00:58:11,293
We posted online

1232
00:58:11,376 --> 00:58:13,584
you're going to Taipei for the contest.

1233
00:58:13,668 --> 00:58:15,793
There were thousands of replies
right away.

1234
00:58:15,876 --> 00:58:17,209
We found you a hotel.

1235
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:18,543
This is the address and phone number.

1236
00:58:18,626 --> 00:58:20,084
Thanks.

1237
00:58:20,168 --> 00:58:21,668
Who are they?

1238
00:58:21,751 --> 00:58:22,876
Our assistants.

1239
00:58:22,959 --> 00:58:24,418
We call them Stooges.

1240
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,584
What's up! You are?

1241
00:58:27,376 --> 00:58:28,334
Stooge A

1242
00:58:28,418 --> 00:58:29,459
Stooge B

1243
00:58:29,543 --> 00:58:31,918
Stooges A and B, start loading up.

1244
00:58:32,209 --> 00:58:33,168
What?

1245
00:58:33,251 --> 00:58:33,834
What?

1246
00:58:33,918 --> 00:58:35,751
Hurry up. Move your asses.

1247
00:58:35,834 --> 00:58:36,959
What are you staring at?

1248
00:58:37,043 --> 00:58:38,293
Hurry, come on.

1249
00:58:38,751 --> 00:58:39,918
Get it together.

1250
00:58:40,001 --> 00:58:41,043
How are you? Stooge A.

1251
00:58:41,126 --> 00:58:43,084
How are you? Stooge B

1252
00:58:47,918 --> 00:58:48,376
Hello!

1253
00:58:48,459 --> 00:58:50,126
Ai Fong Eatery. Can I help you?

1254
00:58:50,543 --> 00:58:51,543
What?

1255
00:58:51,626 --> 00:58:52,668
The police station?

1256
00:58:55,834 --> 00:58:57,834
What happened?

1257
00:58:58,168 --> 00:58:58,834
Grandpa

1258
00:58:58,918 --> 00:59:00,584
grabbed this old lady's ass.

1259
00:59:00,668 --> 00:59:02,709
Old lady? I'm not that old!

1260
00:59:02,793 --> 00:59:03,793
Look at this

1261
00:59:03,876 --> 00:59:04,584
old fart.

1262
00:59:04,709 --> 00:59:05,793
Old pervert.

1263
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:06,918
Ma'am, calm down.

1264
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:08,709
He's lost his mind. Don't be angry with him.

1265
00:59:09,501 --> 00:59:10,584
He wouldn't have touched you

1266
00:59:10,668 --> 00:59:12,126
if he was thinking clearly.

1267
00:59:12,209 --> 00:59:13,709
Are you saying I'm ugly?

1268
00:59:13,793 --> 00:59:14,459
No no,

1269
00:59:14,543 --> 00:59:15,584
that's not what she meant.

1270
00:59:15,668 --> 00:59:16,626
Please calm down, calm down.

1271
00:59:16,709 --> 00:59:19,334
That's it. I want him to move out now.

1272
00:59:19,418 --> 00:59:21,043
Move out? Where else can they live?

1273
00:59:21,126 --> 00:59:23,126
I don't care.

1274
00:59:23,209 --> 00:59:24,418
I'll sue him if he doesn't leave.

1275
00:59:24,501 --> 00:59:25,501
Don't just throw them out.

1276
00:59:25,584 --> 00:59:26,709
Where can they go?

1277
00:59:26,793 --> 00:59:28,001
Have some compassion!

1278
00:59:28,084 --> 00:59:29,709
Move out now!

1279
00:59:31,043 --> 00:59:32,543
Fine! We will!

1280
00:59:32,626 --> 00:59:33,334
Fat ass!

1281
00:59:33,418 --> 00:59:34,543
Who are you calling a fat ass?

1282
00:59:34,626 --> 00:59:35,334
You're the fat ass!

1283
00:59:35,418 --> 00:59:36,501
What now!

1284
00:59:49,543 --> 00:59:51,709
Do we have to take them with us?

1285
00:59:54,668 --> 00:59:56,001
What else can we do?

1286
00:59:56,084 --> 00:59:58,084
Leave them?

1287
01:00:11,876 --> 01:00:14,293
Change the song.
This one keeps repeating.

1288
01:00:14,376 --> 01:00:16,334
We can't. Stereo's busted.

1289
01:00:16,418 --> 01:00:18,251
This is it.

1290
01:00:18,334 --> 01:00:21,001
It's driving me nuts.

1291
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:22,959
I think this song's pretty good.

1292
01:00:23,334 --> 01:00:25,543
(Hai, going to Taipei
for a catering competition)

1293
01:00:56,418 --> 01:00:57,751
Hi, Little Fish?

1294
01:00:57,834 --> 01:00:58,876
We're here.

1295
01:00:58,959 --> 01:01:01,501
We're here. Thanks.

1296
01:01:01,793 --> 01:01:03,584
He's coming to get us.

1297
01:01:05,001 --> 01:01:06,584
Is that him?

1298
01:01:07,459 --> 01:01:08,709
Him?

1299
01:01:12,584 --> 01:01:13,709
WC!

1300
01:01:13,793 --> 01:01:16,126
You sure his name isn't huge fish?

1301
01:01:18,626 --> 01:01:20,293
Welcome, you're Wan?

1302
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:20,876
Then...

1303
01:01:20,959 --> 01:01:22,418
you must be huge One.

1304
01:01:24,209 --> 01:01:26,043
You can follow me inside in a moment.

1305
01:01:26,126 --> 01:01:27,043
Thanks a lot.

1306
01:01:27,126 --> 01:01:28,501
Why is it so dark here?

1307
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:29,834
This is the back entrance.

1308
01:01:30,834 --> 01:01:32,959
Why don't we stay at the Grand Hotel?

1309
01:01:33,043 --> 01:01:34,168
This way please.

1310
01:01:34,459 --> 01:01:36,001
I managed to get 3 rooms for you all.

1311
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:38,334
Right here?

1312
01:01:38,418 --> 01:01:39,168
No.

1313
01:01:39,251 --> 01:01:40,418
Lower your voice a bit.

1314
01:01:40,501 --> 01:01:42,001
Just go straight.

1315
01:01:42,251 --> 01:01:43,084
What a crappy place.

1316
01:01:43,168 --> 01:01:44,251
What if someone finds out?

1317
01:01:44,334 --> 01:01:46,584
No way, my girlfriend works the front desk.

1318
01:01:46,668 --> 01:01:48,001
The manager
doesn't check this area at night.

1319
01:01:48,084 --> 01:01:50,334
We're all online friends
with Animals on Call.

1320
01:01:51,126 --> 01:01:52,626
The Animal on Calls are well-connected.

1321
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:53,793
Now you know.

1322
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,168
You said your girlfriend
works the front desk?

1323
01:01:55,418 --> 01:01:57,293
Nowadays the catering masters
are so wasteful

1324
01:01:57,376 --> 01:01:58,459
They don't care about saving the costs.

1325
01:01:58,543 --> 01:01:59,293
Look at this

1326
01:01:59,376 --> 01:02:00,668
expensive stuff.

1327
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:02,168
WC.

1328
01:02:04,084 --> 01:02:05,126
These scallions and garlic were unused.

1329
01:02:05,209 --> 01:02:06,626
What a waste.

1330
01:02:07,418 --> 01:02:08,501
You!

1331
01:02:09,084 --> 01:02:10,168
It's you!

1332
01:02:10,501 --> 01:02:12,084
My notebook.

1333
01:02:12,168 --> 01:02:13,293
Stop running!

1334
01:02:15,501 --> 01:02:16,459
Hey!

1335
01:02:16,543 --> 01:02:17,709
Stop running!

1336
01:02:17,793 --> 01:02:19,209
Stop running!

1337
01:02:21,126 --> 01:02:22,543
Give me back my notebook!

1338
01:02:22,626 --> 01:02:23,793
Hey!

1339
01:02:24,668 --> 01:02:26,418
Stop running!

1340
01:02:30,334 --> 01:02:31,001
Hey!

1341
01:02:31,709 --> 01:02:32,251
Hey!

1342
01:02:32,334 --> 01:02:33,126
Stop running!

1343
01:02:37,668 --> 01:02:39,126
Hey! Stop running!

1344
01:04:29,668 --> 01:04:31,543
Where's my notebook?

1345
01:04:33,543 --> 01:04:34,376
Sorry,

1346
01:04:34,459 --> 01:04:35,793
I wasn't careful with it.

1347
01:04:35,876 --> 01:04:38,001
I tore out some pages to make a fire.

1348
01:04:42,043 --> 01:04:45,126
You burned my dad's book of recipes!

1349
01:04:45,209 --> 01:04:47,168
Are you interested in cooking?

1350
01:04:47,543 --> 01:04:49,501
I have no interest.

1351
01:04:49,584 --> 01:04:50,876
That's fine then.

1352
01:04:50,959 --> 01:04:53,376
There's no use in something
you don't need.

1353
01:04:54,126 --> 01:04:55,584
Don't be upset.

1354
01:04:55,668 --> 01:04:57,126
I'll cook something good for you.

1355
01:04:58,126 --> 01:04:59,418
What are you cooking today?

1356
01:04:59,501 --> 01:05:00,918
Cabbage Stew.

1357
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:06,959
Smells good.

1358
01:05:07,834 --> 01:05:09,918
This old uncle surely knows how to cook.

1359
01:05:10,418 --> 01:05:11,501
I've gained 5 kilograms

1360
01:05:11,584 --> 01:05:13,126
since I transferred here.

1361
01:05:27,459 --> 01:05:28,501
It's ready.

1362
01:05:29,459 --> 01:05:30,376
Me first.

1363
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:31,376
You first.

1364
01:05:39,584 --> 01:05:40,709
You knew to bring scallions,

1365
01:05:40,793 --> 01:05:41,793
just what I need.

1366
01:05:46,043 --> 01:05:46,876
Smart.

1367
01:05:46,959 --> 01:05:48,126
You brought me soy sauce.

1368
01:05:51,584 --> 01:05:53,251
Be careful. Come back for seconds.

1369
01:06:00,293 --> 01:06:00,918
Come get some

1370
01:06:01,001 --> 01:06:02,209
if you want.

1371
01:06:55,834 --> 01:06:57,543
You do that, too?

1372
01:07:15,418 --> 01:07:17,001
Where are you?

1373
01:07:21,043 --> 01:07:23,084
I'm on

1374
01:07:23,168 --> 01:07:25,209
a beach by the sea.

1375
01:07:28,168 --> 01:07:30,001
How romantic.

1376
01:07:30,501 --> 01:07:31,918
I'm on the Moon.

1377
01:07:33,709 --> 01:07:35,626
Is it cold on the Moon?

1378
01:07:36,168 --> 01:07:37,918
Not bad. A bit chilly.

1379
01:07:38,001 --> 01:07:40,668
How about there? Sea breeze too windy?

1380
01:07:41,043 --> 01:07:42,751
Not too bad.

1381
01:07:45,751 --> 01:07:47,876
You're...

1382
01:07:47,959 --> 01:07:49,751
Master Silly Mortal.

1383
01:07:51,293 --> 01:07:52,668
How did you know?

1384
01:07:53,376 --> 01:07:55,668
My mom said:

1385
01:07:55,751 --> 01:07:58,084
Eating Master Silly Mortal's food

1386
01:07:58,168 --> 01:08:00,584
will trigger emotions that

1387
01:08:00,668 --> 01:08:02,959
make you feel really human.

1388
01:08:03,043 --> 01:08:04,626
But...

1389
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:10,876
Why do I feel like crying?

1390
01:08:12,543 --> 01:08:15,459
You're so young and pretty.
Why are you crying?

1391
01:08:19,168 --> 01:08:20,959
I just feel bitter.

1392
01:08:22,876 --> 01:08:23,918
Did you know...

1393
01:08:24,001 --> 01:08:26,918
Bitter melon wasn't like that originally.

1394
01:08:27,001 --> 01:08:29,834
It's because of green popper and tomato.

1395
01:08:31,043 --> 01:08:32,543
Green popper

1396
01:08:32,626 --> 01:08:35,168
felt bad about its bitter taste.

1397
01:08:35,251 --> 01:08:38,251
And not being red or popular like a tomato.

1398
01:08:38,334 --> 01:08:40,543
So it often vent to bitter melon.

1399
01:08:40,626 --> 01:08:42,084
But a tomato

1400
01:08:42,168 --> 01:08:44,959
doesn't want to be so red or popular.

1401
01:08:45,043 --> 01:08:46,584
It just wants to be itself.

1402
01:08:46,668 --> 01:08:49,168
So it also vented a lot to bitter melon.

1403
01:08:49,668 --> 01:08:52,084
All the venting stuck with bitter melon.

1404
01:08:52,168 --> 01:08:54,293
And it started to grow bumps.

1405
01:08:54,376 --> 01:08:56,293
That's why bitter melon
looks the way it does.

1406
01:08:57,293 --> 01:08:59,959
So,

1407
01:09:00,043 --> 01:09:01,501
is green popper happier

1408
01:09:01,584 --> 01:09:03,459
than bitter melon?

1409
01:09:03,751 --> 01:09:05,168
You're so silly.

1410
01:09:05,251 --> 01:09:07,376
Trying to make sense of my bullshit.

1411
01:09:10,251 --> 01:09:12,543
So what's so great

1412
01:09:12,626 --> 01:09:14,709
about being a catering master?

1413
01:09:15,876 --> 01:09:16,959
A catering master

1414
01:09:17,043 --> 01:09:19,084
can turn green pepper and bitter melon

1415
01:09:19,168 --> 01:09:20,709
into delicious food.

1416
01:09:20,793 --> 01:09:23,209
You can be proud and make others happy.

1417
01:09:24,918 --> 01:09:27,209
You feel happy
making other people happy?

1418
01:09:27,293 --> 01:09:28,126
Of course.

1419
01:09:28,209 --> 01:09:29,334
I don't have to hear people vent.

1420
01:09:29,418 --> 01:09:30,126
I don't have to hear people vent.

1421
01:09:30,209 --> 01:09:32,501
Wouldn't that make you happy?

1422
01:09:34,584 --> 01:09:36,126
You're not silly at all.

1423
01:09:36,959 --> 01:09:38,584
Why are you called Master Silly Mortal?

1424
01:09:39,793 --> 01:09:40,751
You sure I'm not silly?

1425
01:09:40,834 --> 01:09:41,959
This whole time I've been arguing with you

1426
01:09:42,043 --> 01:09:43,584
wearing a box on my head.

1427
01:09:43,668 --> 01:09:45,168
You sure I'm not silly?

1428
01:09:45,876 --> 01:09:47,084
Then,

1429
01:09:47,168 --> 01:09:49,709
but why are you a drifter

1430
01:09:49,793 --> 01:09:51,543
instead of a chef?

1431
01:09:52,126 --> 01:09:54,459
You'd know if you were on the Moon.

1432
01:09:54,543 --> 01:09:56,418
There's nothing to cook.

1433
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:02,793
Why do you want to go to the Moon?

1434
01:10:02,876 --> 01:10:04,209
It's less crowded

1435
01:10:04,293 --> 01:10:05,751
and cooler here.

1436
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:07,459
Some day

1437
01:10:07,543 --> 01:10:08,876
will I go to the Moon too?

1438
01:10:08,959 --> 01:10:09,709
Hey!

1439
01:10:09,793 --> 01:10:10,709
No way.

1440
01:10:10,793 --> 01:10:12,376
Be nice, give me my space.

1441
01:10:12,459 --> 01:10:13,459
You stay on the beach.

1442
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:15,209
The beach has nicer scenery

1443
01:10:15,293 --> 01:10:16,626
and it's more popular.

1444
01:10:17,751 --> 01:10:19,084
Oh.

1445
01:10:21,959 --> 01:10:23,543
Master, you go in and take a rest.

1446
01:10:23,626 --> 01:10:26,084
I have no idea where Slacker went.

1447
01:10:26,168 --> 01:10:28,626
Please stop mumbling.

1448
01:10:29,126 --> 01:10:30,209
Here she is.

1449
01:10:32,543 --> 01:10:34,543
Where the heck have you been?

1450
01:10:37,584 --> 01:10:38,918
The Moon.

1451
01:10:40,376 --> 01:10:41,459
Hey,

1452
01:10:41,543 --> 01:10:42,876
we've been waiting on earth for you.

1453
01:10:42,959 --> 01:10:44,459
But you decided to go to the damn Moon.

1454
01:10:47,793 --> 01:10:51,834
This hotel room is very comfy.

1455
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:56,834
What are you looking at?

1456
01:10:56,918 --> 01:10:58,418
Math homework?

1457
01:10:58,501 --> 01:10:59,668
No.

1458
01:10:59,751 --> 01:11:00,418
Then what's this?

1459
01:11:00,501 --> 01:11:02,918
I found the notebook Dad left me.

1460
01:11:03,001 --> 01:11:04,251
But look,

1461
01:11:04,334 --> 01:11:06,668
there are only a few pages left.

1462
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:08,543
Let me see.

1463
01:11:08,626 --> 01:11:09,959
This is Honey Cashew Nuts.

1464
01:11:10,043 --> 01:11:11,168
Yes.

1465
01:11:11,251 --> 01:11:12,418
This is Shrimp Rolls.

1466
01:11:14,709 --> 01:11:16,501
What's this drawing of?

1467
01:11:17,168 --> 01:11:18,084
Dad was describing

1468
01:11:18,168 --> 01:11:19,126
how to take the eel

1469
01:11:19,209 --> 01:11:20,126
and de-bone it.

1470
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:21,251
And then stuff it

1471
01:11:21,334 --> 01:11:24,293
with different ingredients.

1472
01:11:24,376 --> 01:11:25,501
You can understand it?

1473
01:11:25,584 --> 01:11:26,793
Yep.

1474
01:11:26,876 --> 01:11:27,959
This is Stuffed Sea Eel.

1475
01:11:28,043 --> 01:11:29,751
No one knows how to make it.

1476
01:11:35,376 --> 01:11:37,584
Shrimp Rolls and Honey Cashew Nuts.

1477
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:39,709
We could make these as appetizers.

1478
01:11:41,126 --> 01:11:43,543
But we still need 3 more dishes
for the starter.

1479
01:11:44,626 --> 01:11:46,834
Go and find that Super Fish guy.

1480
01:11:46,918 --> 01:11:48,418
No, you mean Little Fish.

1481
01:11:48,501 --> 01:11:50,709
Whatever, just find that fish.

1482
01:11:51,834 --> 01:11:54,168
Mom, you really think we can compete?

1483
01:11:54,251 --> 01:11:55,543
Just do it!

1484
01:11:55,626 --> 01:11:57,668
There's no use
watching from the sidelines.

1485
01:11:57,751 --> 01:11:58,751
Hurry!

1486
01:12:03,959 --> 01:12:05,584
It's not funny.

1487
01:12:07,584 --> 01:12:09,084
It's too narrow to walk through.

1488
01:12:09,168 --> 01:12:10,834
Just be careful.

1489
01:12:11,793 --> 01:12:13,709
You can do your preparations here.

1490
01:12:13,793 --> 01:12:15,084
The manager will be in soon.

1491
01:12:15,168 --> 01:12:16,876
So don't go downstairs for now.

1492
01:12:16,959 --> 01:12:17,959
Okay okay.

1493
01:12:18,043 --> 01:12:18,834
By the way,

1494
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:20,876
I got some ingredients for you.

1495
01:12:20,959 --> 01:12:23,334
For the cold starter: top shell, jelly fish.

1496
01:12:23,418 --> 01:12:24,793
Canned top shell and jolly fish.

1497
01:12:24,876 --> 01:12:26,043
All right.

1498
01:12:26,126 --> 01:12:27,543
And here's the best one:

1499
01:12:27,626 --> 01:12:29,626
Sausages based on
my family secret recipe

1500
01:12:29,709 --> 01:12:31,001
Handed down from my Grandma.

1501
01:12:31,084 --> 01:12:33,043
Finest in the world.

1502
01:12:33,834 --> 01:12:34,418
Wonderful!

1503
01:12:34,501 --> 01:12:36,001
We know it's delicious by looking at you.

1504
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:37,126
Okay, good luck everyone!

1505
01:12:37,209 --> 01:12:37,709
I have to go.

1506
01:12:37,793 --> 01:12:38,668
Okay, thanks!

1507
01:12:38,751 --> 01:12:39,793
Thanks so much.

1508
01:12:39,876 --> 01:12:40,626
Over here.

1509
01:12:41,501 --> 01:12:42,751
Great,

1510
01:12:42,834 --> 01:12:45,251
now we have 5 items for the cold starter.

1511
01:12:45,918 --> 01:12:47,418
I'll do the Honey Cashew Nuts first.

1512
01:12:47,501 --> 01:12:48,876
You teach them
how to make Shrimp Rolls.

1513
01:12:48,959 --> 01:12:49,584
Okay.

1514
01:12:50,376 --> 01:12:52,084
Come help out.

1515
01:12:53,084 --> 01:12:53,626
Us?

1516
01:12:53,709 --> 01:12:54,209
Yeah.

1517
01:12:54,293 --> 01:12:55,834
You want us to work?

1518
01:12:56,834 --> 01:12:58,834
Aren't you Stooge A and Stooge B?

1519
01:12:58,918 --> 01:13:00,543
Stooges have to help cater.

1520
01:13:01,084 --> 01:13:02,251
But we're just pretending to be stooges.

1521
01:13:02,334 --> 01:13:04,459
Go screw yourself.

1522
01:13:04,543 --> 01:13:05,626
We can all quit now.

1523
01:13:05,709 --> 01:13:08,001
We'll quit and all go to prison

1524
01:13:08,084 --> 01:13:09,084
for the money we owe.

1525
01:13:09,168 --> 01:13:10,459
You owe us money

1526
01:13:10,543 --> 01:13:12,668
and you expect us to work?

1527
01:13:12,751 --> 01:13:14,668
Fine! Let's just all quit!

1528
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:19,209
So dramatic.

1529
01:13:19,293 --> 01:13:22,084
You'd better get me first the place.

1530
01:13:22,168 --> 01:13:23,668
Not second place.

1531
01:13:23,751 --> 01:13:25,209
Okay, okay.

1532
01:13:25,293 --> 01:13:26,043
Okay.

1533
01:13:26,126 --> 01:13:28,043
Bro, can you help me move this?

1534
01:13:28,126 --> 01:13:30,001
Please, it's so heavy.

1535
01:13:30,418 --> 01:13:31,043
What's the problem?

1536
01:13:31,126 --> 01:13:32,793
Did you not eat? So weak!

1537
01:13:32,876 --> 01:13:34,709
Show some strength.

1538
01:13:34,793 --> 01:13:37,584
I hate doing this.

1539
01:13:37,668 --> 01:13:39,501
That's right. This is it.

1540
01:13:39,584 --> 01:13:40,751
I hate doing this.

1541
01:13:40,834 --> 01:13:43,126
You got it.

1542
01:13:43,209 --> 01:13:44,251
Do it again.

1543
01:13:44,334 --> 01:13:45,584
I hate doing this.

1544
01:13:45,668 --> 01:13:46,543
Again.

1545
01:13:46,626 --> 01:13:47,543
Again.

1546
01:13:47,626 --> 01:13:48,126
That's it.

1547
01:13:48,209 --> 01:13:49,876
Lift it up.

1548
01:13:50,751 --> 01:13:52,376
I hate doing this.

1549
01:13:52,459 --> 01:13:54,918
Yes yes, great job.

1550
01:13:55,001 --> 01:13:57,293
I hate doing this.

1551
01:13:57,376 --> 01:13:59,459
I hate doing this.

1552
01:13:59,543 --> 01:14:01,584
I hate doing this.

1553
01:14:09,793 --> 01:14:11,126
Okay!

1554
01:14:11,501 --> 01:14:13,251
Focus on feeling every single chop.

1555
01:15:01,084 --> 01:15:03,543
The grief's all gone.

1556
01:15:03,626 --> 01:15:04,918
Look.

1557
01:15:11,876 --> 01:15:12,876
Here!

1558
01:15:12,959 --> 01:15:14,918
Wear this for the contest tomorrow.

1559
01:15:15,418 --> 01:15:16,709
Professional!

1560
01:15:22,209 --> 01:15:23,876
Very professional.

1561
01:15:24,376 --> 01:15:25,459
No way. it's ugly.

1562
01:15:25,543 --> 01:15:27,918
It's not. Your dad wore it, don't complain.

1563
01:15:28,001 --> 01:15:28,668
Well I don't want to.

1564
01:15:28,751 --> 01:15:30,293
Just wear it.

1565
01:15:30,376 --> 01:15:32,501
Whatever. I'm going to take a shower.

1566
01:15:32,584 --> 01:15:33,626
The contest starts tomorrow.

1567
01:15:33,709 --> 01:15:35,209
Get your spirits up.

1568
01:15:35,293 --> 01:15:36,584
What are you going to wear then?

1569
01:15:43,668 --> 01:15:44,876
The preliminary round of

1570
01:15:44,959 --> 01:15:46,751
Taiwan's first National Catering Contest

1571
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:48,626
has finally begun.

1572
01:15:48,876 --> 01:15:51,293
Today's challenge is cold starters.

1573
01:15:51,376 --> 01:15:53,584
98 catering masters
have some from all over

1574
01:15:53,668 --> 01:15:56,376
to prepare their best

1575
01:15:56,459 --> 01:15:57,168
cold starters.

1576
01:15:59,584 --> 01:16:01,043
They're broadcasting this.

1577
01:16:01,126 --> 01:16:02,418
I need to put on more make up.

1578
01:16:04,043 --> 01:16:04,834
Little girl.

1579
01:16:04,918 --> 01:16:06,418
Can you deliver this

1580
01:16:06,501 --> 01:16:08,751
to a woman named Chan Hsiao Wan?

1581
01:16:08,834 --> 01:16:09,918
Repeat after me.

1582
01:16:10,001 --> 01:16:11,959
Chan Hsiao Wan.

1583
01:16:15,043 --> 01:16:16,918
What are you doing here?

1584
01:16:18,418 --> 01:16:19,043
Little girl,

1585
01:16:19,126 --> 01:16:20,626
never mind. Thanks.

1586
01:16:32,793 --> 01:16:34,418
What is this?

1587
01:16:34,501 --> 01:16:35,709
Meaning.

1588
01:16:37,376 --> 01:16:39,501
What meaning?

1589
01:16:39,584 --> 01:16:40,876
Do you know?

1590
01:16:41,584 --> 01:16:43,626
Something just ordinary to others,

1591
01:16:43,709 --> 01:16:45,584
can have real meaning

1592
01:16:45,668 --> 01:16:47,084
to the right person.

1593
01:16:48,209 --> 01:16:50,126
This is for you.

1594
01:16:50,209 --> 01:16:52,334
Hope that in your life

1595
01:16:52,418 --> 01:16:54,168
you can find some meaning.

1596
01:16:55,959 --> 01:16:58,543
And that you'll think of me.

1597
01:16:59,001 --> 01:16:59,959
Huh?

1598
01:17:00,043 --> 01:17:01,251
What are you talking about?

1599
01:17:03,084 --> 01:17:04,793
Let's go for it!

1600
01:17:09,793 --> 01:17:11,668
This has gone sour.

1601
01:17:15,001 --> 01:17:17,709
Damn! Jolly fish has gone bad!

1602
01:17:17,793 --> 01:17:19,334
What's that you're holding?

1603
01:17:20,001 --> 01:17:21,584
I ran into Hai.

1604
01:17:22,126 --> 01:17:23,418
What's this?

1605
01:17:23,501 --> 01:17:24,668
Meaning.

1606
01:17:26,876 --> 01:17:28,293
It's just a century egg.

1607
01:17:28,376 --> 01:17:29,584
Meaning my ass.

1608
01:17:31,001 --> 01:17:32,876
We could replace the jelly fish with it!

1609
01:17:41,043 --> 01:17:41,626
Okay,

1610
01:17:41,709 --> 01:17:43,959
our judges
have already started evaluating.

1611
01:17:44,043 --> 01:17:47,001
Looks like various entries
have been selected.

1612
01:18:10,251 --> 01:18:11,793
Thanks thanks.

1613
01:18:12,209 --> 01:18:14,834
That was easier than I thought.

1614
01:18:14,918 --> 01:18:15,918
Hey hey hey.

1615
01:18:16,001 --> 01:18:17,001
Hey hey hey your ass.

1616
01:18:17,084 --> 01:18:19,209
Don't get too cocky yet.

1617
01:18:19,293 --> 01:18:21,126
We still have the second round tomorrow.

1618
01:18:21,209 --> 01:18:22,334
The most important thing now

1619
01:18:22,418 --> 01:18:24,834
is to prepare Master Fly Spirit's specialty.

1620
01:18:24,918 --> 01:18:26,668
Stuffed Sea Eel.

1621
01:18:27,043 --> 01:18:28,334
Sounds like it's hard to make.

1622
01:18:28,418 --> 01:18:29,084
Definitely not easy.

1623
01:18:29,168 --> 01:18:30,168
Not easy for sure.

1624
01:18:30,251 --> 01:18:31,834
That's why you have to work harder.

1625
01:18:31,918 --> 01:18:33,376
I'll leave it to you guys.

1626
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:34,668
Be careful.

1627
01:18:36,209 --> 01:18:37,293
Why does she get to go?

1628
01:18:37,376 --> 01:18:37,959
Why does she?

1629
01:18:38,043 --> 01:18:40,626
Her nickname is Slacker, right?

1630
01:18:41,126 --> 01:18:41,876
Come on,

1631
01:18:41,959 --> 01:18:43,043
Stooge B,

1632
01:18:43,126 --> 01:18:44,168
grab an eel.

1633
01:18:44,251 --> 01:18:44,959
Me?

1634
01:18:45,043 --> 01:18:46,376
Hurry up!

1635
01:18:46,459 --> 01:18:48,084
Hold its head down.

1636
01:18:48,334 --> 01:18:49,209
You have work to do too.

1637
01:18:49,293 --> 01:18:50,251
Don't think I forgot.

1638
01:18:50,334 --> 01:18:51,751
Now take this.

1639
01:18:51,834 --> 01:18:52,709
And cut it open

1640
01:18:52,793 --> 01:18:53,501
from here.

1641
01:18:54,751 --> 01:18:56,334
Why didn't you warn me?

1642
01:18:56,418 --> 01:18:56,876
About what?

1643
01:18:56,959 --> 01:18:57,501
Here's the knife.

1644
01:18:57,584 --> 01:18:58,168
I can't do it.

1645
01:18:58,251 --> 01:18:59,418
Cut the eel open.

1646
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:01,168
Hurry! The eel is slipping away.

1647
01:19:01,251 --> 01:19:01,793
Come on. Hurry.

1648
01:19:01,876 --> 01:19:03,043
Aren't you a gangster? Here.

1649
01:19:03,126 --> 01:19:04,084
No way, you do it.

1650
01:19:07,126 --> 01:19:08,709
You two are really awesome.

1651
01:19:08,793 --> 01:19:11,001
Too bad that you're bad guys.

1652
01:19:11,084 --> 01:19:12,293
I'm not a bad guy.

1653
01:19:12,709 --> 01:19:13,376
Stooge A,

1654
01:19:13,459 --> 01:19:15,459
pick the bones out with chopsticks.

1655
01:19:15,543 --> 01:19:16,668
Then stuff the ingredients in.

1656
01:19:16,751 --> 01:19:17,918
Impossible.

1657
01:19:18,001 --> 01:19:19,084
Who do you think I am?

1658
01:19:19,168 --> 01:19:20,501
Didn't you major in Arts and Crafts?

1659
01:19:20,584 --> 01:19:21,501
Move your hand.

1660
01:19:21,584 --> 01:19:22,209
Like this?

1661
01:19:22,293 --> 01:19:23,251
That's right.

1662
01:19:23,501 --> 01:19:25,209
Got it.

1663
01:19:25,751 --> 01:19:26,459
Nice!

1664
01:19:27,376 --> 01:19:28,043
Really.

1665
01:19:28,126 --> 01:19:28,584
Nice!

1666
01:19:34,418 --> 01:19:35,668
It's damn delicious.

1667
01:19:35,751 --> 01:19:36,834
Damn delicious.

1668
01:19:36,918 --> 01:19:38,001
Yummy.

1669
01:19:38,084 --> 01:19:38,959
We're going to win!

1670
01:19:39,043 --> 01:19:40,293
We are!

1671
01:19:40,501 --> 01:19:41,376
How's it going?

1672
01:19:41,459 --> 01:19:42,293
Finished. Here.

1673
01:19:42,376 --> 01:19:43,209
Slacker, try it.

1674
01:19:43,293 --> 01:19:44,168
Hurry.

1675
01:19:44,251 --> 01:19:45,751
No, thanks. I don't eat fish.

1676
01:19:45,834 --> 01:19:47,043
But we're making fish tomorrow.

1677
01:19:47,126 --> 01:19:48,043
You're not going?

1678
01:19:48,126 --> 01:19:48,918
That's right.

1679
01:19:49,001 --> 01:19:50,751
Even if you might be on TV?

1680
01:19:51,543 --> 01:19:52,251
On TV?

1681
01:19:52,334 --> 01:19:53,209
Yeah.

1682
01:19:53,293 --> 01:19:54,084
Hurry up.

1683
01:19:54,168 --> 01:19:55,168
Okay.

1684
01:19:55,251 --> 01:19:56,584
I need to put on more make up.

1685
01:20:02,709 --> 01:20:04,501
Taiwan's first National Catering Contest

1686
01:20:04,584 --> 01:20:06,668
has started it's second round.

1687
01:20:12,168 --> 01:20:13,918
Today's category is fish.

1688
01:20:14,001 --> 01:20:16,501
Let's see what amazing dishes
the top 10 chefs

1689
01:20:16,584 --> 01:20:18,668
will prepare for us.

1690
01:20:18,751 --> 01:20:20,543
It's show time!

1691
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:24,209
Miss Wan looks so beautiful.

1692
01:20:24,293 --> 01:20:25,709
Nice!

1693
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:32,876
Go for it!

1694
01:20:37,001 --> 01:20:38,751
Go Wan.

1695
01:20:42,209 --> 01:20:42,626
Okay,

1696
01:20:42,709 --> 01:20:44,293
our judges have started their evaluating.

1697
01:20:44,376 --> 01:20:46,293
Let's wait patiently.

1698
01:20:52,584 --> 01:20:53,501
Okay, the time has now come

1699
01:20:53,584 --> 01:20:55,793
for our judges to announce

1700
01:20:55,876 --> 01:20:58,084
which 2 finalists made the

1701
01:20:58,168 --> 01:20:59,126
final competition.

1702
01:21:02,584 --> 01:21:03,959
We'd like to announce

1703
01:21:04,043 --> 01:21:06,043
that the 2 finalists are:

1704
01:21:06,459 --> 01:21:08,751
Number 21, Liao Yi Tsai.

1705
01:21:08,834 --> 01:21:10,293
Yeah!

1706
01:21:11,459 --> 01:21:13,959
And Number 10, Hsiao Jin Rong.

1707
01:21:14,959 --> 01:21:16,251
They chose us!

1708
01:21:17,668 --> 01:21:18,501
No way.

1709
01:21:18,584 --> 01:21:20,334
Are they all blind?

1710
01:21:20,418 --> 01:21:22,001
How can this be?

1711
01:21:22,459 --> 01:21:24,043
Are you sure? That's not right!

1712
01:21:24,126 --> 01:21:24,918
Don't applaud.

1713
01:21:25,001 --> 01:21:26,126
This isn't fair.

1714
01:21:26,209 --> 01:21:27,376
Not right!

1715
01:21:27,459 --> 01:21:28,793
Wait a second.

1716
01:21:30,168 --> 01:21:31,668
Looks like something's going on.

1717
01:21:31,751 --> 01:21:33,543
One of the judges has a concern.

1718
01:21:38,543 --> 01:21:39,709
Everyone,

1719
01:21:42,043 --> 01:21:44,126
the ingredient Mr. Hsiao used

1720
01:21:44,209 --> 01:21:46,251
was crocodile meat.

1721
01:21:46,793 --> 01:21:48,376
Strictly speaking,

1722
01:21:48,459 --> 01:21:50,084
crocodile is not fish.

1723
01:21:50,293 --> 01:21:50,918
I knew it.

1724
01:21:51,001 --> 01:21:52,584
Right, crocodile isn't fish.

1725
01:21:53,084 --> 01:21:54,459
Therefore, we're disqualifying

1726
01:21:54,543 --> 01:21:56,834
number 10, Mr. Hsiao.

1727
01:21:56,918 --> 01:21:58,418
The runner up Chan Hsiao Wan is now

1728
01:21:58,501 --> 01:22:00,834
in the final competition.

1729
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:03,709
That's more like it!

1730
01:22:03,793 --> 01:22:04,543
Not fair.

1731
01:22:04,626 --> 01:22:05,251
Must be a mistake.

1732
01:22:05,334 --> 01:22:07,084
Crocodile isn't fish, are you sure?

1733
01:22:07,709 --> 01:22:09,376
We won! We won!

1734
01:22:11,251 --> 01:22:12,918
How are eels considered fish?

1735
01:22:13,293 --> 01:22:15,668
Our final competition will be in two days.

1736
01:22:15,751 --> 01:22:18,334
A duel between
famous Southern catering master,

1737
01:22:18,418 --> 01:22:19,251
Master Tsai.

1738
01:22:19,334 --> 01:22:23,001
And the rookie female chef, Master Wan.

1739
01:22:23,084 --> 01:22:24,959
The Real Duel!

1740
01:22:25,043 --> 01:22:26,793
Don't push your luck.

1741
01:22:26,876 --> 01:22:28,001
Move it.

1742
01:22:28,876 --> 01:22:31,209
We've got 2 wins in a row already.

1743
01:22:31,959 --> 01:22:32,793
How are you?

1744
01:22:33,043 --> 01:22:34,334
I thought you were afraid of fish.

1745
01:22:34,418 --> 01:22:36,251
But I couldn't even tell.

1746
01:22:37,001 --> 01:22:38,834
I forgot.

1747
01:22:41,584 --> 01:22:45,293
Slacker, the final competition is in 2 days.

1748
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:47,876
We haven't figured out
what 5 courses to make.

1749
01:22:51,293 --> 01:22:52,126
Okay.

1750
01:22:52,209 --> 01:22:54,543
Let's pick 5 courses

1751
01:22:54,626 --> 01:22:56,334
from the wedding menu.

1752
01:22:56,418 --> 01:22:57,334
Look this.

1753
01:22:57,418 --> 01:22:59,126
Cabbage Stew.

1754
01:22:59,209 --> 01:22:59,918
I can make that.

1755
01:23:00,001 --> 01:23:01,209
Let's do Fried River Eels.

1756
01:23:01,293 --> 01:23:03,001
It's your dad's most famous course.

1757
01:23:03,084 --> 01:23:04,918
We'll win with it for sure.

1758
01:23:05,001 --> 01:23:05,501
Sure.

1759
01:23:05,584 --> 01:23:06,918
But I'm afraid to. You do it.

1760
01:23:08,001 --> 01:23:09,459
Don't be like that.

1761
01:23:09,543 --> 01:23:11,293
I've ruined his reputation once already.

1762
01:23:11,376 --> 01:23:12,876
This time you have to win.

1763
01:23:12,959 --> 01:23:13,834
Please.

1764
01:23:13,918 --> 01:23:16,418
Please, please.

1765
01:23:17,126 --> 01:23:17,834
How about this:

1766
01:23:17,918 --> 01:23:18,876
We try making all the

1767
01:23:18,959 --> 01:23:20,001
courses on the menu

1768
01:23:20,084 --> 01:23:23,293
and compete with the one we make best?

1769
01:23:23,376 --> 01:23:24,376
Okay!

1770
01:23:26,251 --> 01:23:27,376
Let's see.

1771
01:23:27,459 --> 01:23:31,209
We should put the turtle
in the pork belly first,

1772
01:23:31,293 --> 01:23:33,709
then stuff it into the chicken.

1773
01:23:33,793 --> 01:23:34,584
No,

1774
01:23:34,668 --> 01:23:37,126
I think we should take the pork belly

1775
01:23:37,209 --> 01:23:38,376
and put it in the chicken first.

1776
01:23:38,459 --> 01:23:40,459
Then put the turtle into the pork belly.

1777
01:23:41,376 --> 01:23:44,043
How's that different from what I said?

1778
01:23:44,126 --> 01:23:44,668
Enough.

1779
01:23:44,751 --> 01:23:45,626
You two figure it out.

1780
01:23:45,709 --> 01:23:46,918
Wan and I will do

1781
01:23:47,001 --> 01:23:48,376
the Spareribs with Water Chestnuts.

1782
01:23:48,793 --> 01:23:50,918
Why do we always get the hardest job?

1783
01:23:51,001 --> 01:23:51,709
You can do this dish then!

1784
01:23:51,793 --> 01:23:53,543
If you know how, then do it!

1785
01:23:54,084 --> 01:23:55,251
Listen, we've got 2 wins already.

1786
01:23:55,334 --> 01:23:57,334
We're just one stop away from first prize.

1787
01:23:57,418 --> 01:23:59,168
Let's work as a team.

1788
01:23:59,251 --> 01:24:00,293
Okay?

1789
01:24:00,376 --> 01:24:01,543
Okay! Okay!

1790
01:24:01,626 --> 01:24:02,459
We'll go do it over there.

1791
01:24:02,543 --> 01:24:04,084
Fine, fine.

1792
01:24:04,168 --> 01:24:05,501
Teamwork.

1793
01:24:05,584 --> 01:24:06,626
Fine, teamwork, teamwork.

1794
01:24:06,709 --> 01:24:07,834
Go for it!

1795
01:24:11,084 --> 01:24:13,209
We don't have any water chestnuts!

1796
01:24:13,293 --> 01:24:14,793
What should we do?

1797
01:24:15,251 --> 01:24:17,001
Work first on something else.

1798
01:24:17,084 --> 01:24:18,918
What else?

1799
01:24:19,001 --> 01:24:20,168
What can we make...

1800
01:24:20,251 --> 01:24:20,709
Here it is.

1801
01:24:20,793 --> 01:24:21,459
It's done.

1802
01:24:21,543 --> 01:24:22,084
Here.

1803
01:24:22,501 --> 01:24:23,168
Here.

1804
01:24:24,168 --> 01:24:25,876
How can you be so sick!

1805
01:24:26,543 --> 01:24:28,168
Sick?

1806
01:24:28,251 --> 01:24:28,918
Look,

1807
01:24:29,001 --> 01:24:30,126
I squeezed the turtle's head

1808
01:24:30,209 --> 01:24:31,918
into the chicken's behind,

1809
01:24:32,001 --> 01:24:34,793
then the chicken's head into the pork belly.

1810
01:24:34,876 --> 01:24:35,376
Perfect!

1811
01:24:35,459 --> 01:24:36,126
Gross!

1812
01:24:36,584 --> 01:24:37,501
I've got it.

1813
01:24:37,584 --> 01:24:39,668
You have to gut the chicken first.

1814
01:24:39,751 --> 01:24:41,876
Then stuff the turtle in.

1815
01:24:41,959 --> 01:24:43,209
Gut the chicken?

1816
01:24:43,293 --> 01:24:44,293
Right!

1817
01:24:44,376 --> 01:24:45,793
We have the best cutting knife here,

1818
01:24:45,876 --> 01:24:46,751
ready to go!

1819
01:24:46,834 --> 01:24:48,043
Hey hey hey.

1820
01:24:48,126 --> 01:24:50,626
They call me "The Sharpest Knife".

1821
01:24:53,834 --> 01:24:54,584
Great!

1822
01:24:55,293 --> 01:24:55,709
Awesome.

1823
01:24:55,793 --> 01:24:56,668
So amazing.

1824
01:24:56,751 --> 01:24:57,959
Amazing! Amazing!

1825
01:24:58,043 --> 01:24:58,501
Wait.

1826
01:24:58,584 --> 01:24:59,834
There's a hole here.

1827
01:25:01,293 --> 01:25:02,418
Not even a small hole?

1828
01:25:02,501 --> 01:25:03,168
No.

1829
01:25:03,251 --> 01:25:03,959
You can do better.

1830
01:25:04,043 --> 01:25:04,751
Go do it.

1831
01:25:11,668 --> 01:25:13,126
This belongs to Tsai.

1832
01:25:19,626 --> 01:25:21,293
500 pieces.

1833
01:25:22,626 --> 01:25:24,293
Do 500 pieces first.

1834
01:25:41,126 --> 01:25:42,209
Master,

1835
01:25:43,459 --> 01:25:45,168
we have to listen to music?

1836
01:25:47,376 --> 01:25:49,584
I thought I told you before.

1837
01:25:49,668 --> 01:25:52,918
Everyone should have a theme song
for his life.

1838
01:25:53,001 --> 01:25:54,751
And a different song

1839
01:25:54,834 --> 01:25:56,793
for every part.

1840
01:25:57,876 --> 01:26:00,043
So whenever you hear a particular song

1841
01:26:00,126 --> 01:26:02,959
it can take you back
to that part of your life.

1842
01:26:20,126 --> 01:26:21,459
After the scallions,

1843
01:26:21,543 --> 01:26:23,043
do the ham and mushroom.

1844
01:26:25,668 --> 01:26:27,418
I feel like an oriental tailor.

1845
01:26:28,876 --> 01:26:30,209
Go for it!

1846
01:26:33,334 --> 01:26:35,626
You have your song.

1847
01:26:35,709 --> 01:26:38,418
So do I.

1848
01:26:40,084 --> 01:26:46,251
Silly Girl is blowing her horn

1849
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:51,168
Do So La Si Fa

1850
01:26:53,001 --> 01:26:53,793
Oops,

1851
01:26:53,876 --> 01:26:54,876
exploded again.

1852
01:26:55,668 --> 01:26:56,834
How come?

1853
01:26:57,876 --> 01:26:58,751
No big deal.

1854
01:26:58,834 --> 01:27:01,209
The turtle's still inside the chicken.

1855
01:27:01,293 --> 01:27:01,876
No.

1856
01:27:01,959 --> 01:27:04,126
It needs to be perfect. It can't explode.

1857
01:27:04,709 --> 01:27:05,918
Wrong flavor.

1858
01:27:08,043 --> 01:27:09,626
Let me think of a way.

1859
01:27:10,501 --> 01:27:12,709
What other way is there?

1860
01:27:12,793 --> 01:27:13,751
It's too tough,

1861
01:27:13,834 --> 01:27:15,668
like chewing a rubber band.

1862
01:27:19,751 --> 01:27:20,459
It's raining.

1863
01:27:20,543 --> 01:27:22,126
Take a break for now.

1864
01:27:22,209 --> 01:27:23,334
Your weather here in Taipei is weird,
so erratic.

1865
01:27:23,418 --> 01:27:24,459
Your weather here in Taipei is weird,
so erratic.

1866
01:27:24,543 --> 01:27:26,418
I don't know. Take a break.

1867
01:27:26,959 --> 01:27:29,543
Sunny this moment and raining the next.

1868
01:27:51,418 --> 01:27:52,793
Master Silly Mortal.

1869
01:27:55,251 --> 01:27:56,459
Master Silly Mortal.

1870
01:28:01,584 --> 01:28:02,959
Yes?

1871
01:28:05,751 --> 01:28:07,418
Master Silly Mortal, there you are.

1872
01:28:11,459 --> 01:28:13,251
Well,

1873
01:28:14,126 --> 01:28:15,834
I'm going to compete soon.

1874
01:28:15,918 --> 01:28:18,668
But I don't know what to do.

1875
01:28:19,751 --> 01:28:21,793
Your dad was so great, so famous.

1876
01:28:21,876 --> 01:28:23,834
And you don't know what to do.

1877
01:28:24,668 --> 01:28:26,251
It's not that.

1878
01:28:26,334 --> 01:28:28,876
I have to make traditional flavors.

1879
01:28:28,959 --> 01:28:30,251
Traditional flavors?

1880
01:28:31,001 --> 01:28:33,043
Traditional soy sauce might help

1881
01:28:33,126 --> 01:28:35,418
if you can find it.

1882
01:28:35,501 --> 01:28:37,084
Traditional soy sauce?

1883
01:28:38,543 --> 01:28:40,376
But without a traditional heart,

1884
01:28:40,459 --> 01:28:42,626
how can you make traditional flavors?

1885
01:28:43,418 --> 01:28:44,876
Traditional heart?

1886
01:28:48,334 --> 01:28:50,584
Come over again tomorrow night.

1887
01:28:52,959 --> 01:28:54,251
Good night.

1888
01:29:08,334 --> 01:29:10,376
You're taking this too seriously!

1889
01:29:39,043 --> 01:29:40,251
Where are Master Tiger Nose
and Rosemary?

1890
01:29:40,334 --> 01:29:41,584
They probably went out for a walk.

1891
01:29:41,668 --> 01:29:43,043
Thanks for the card.

1892
01:29:43,126 --> 01:29:44,501
Got a flush now.

1893
01:29:45,501 --> 01:29:48,251
The competition is tomorrow.
Aren't you nervous?

1894
01:29:48,334 --> 01:29:49,293
Very nervous. Flush!

1895
01:29:49,376 --> 01:29:50,209
Super nervous...

1896
01:29:50,293 --> 01:29:51,334
about getting a bad card!

1897
01:29:51,418 --> 01:29:53,418
Here comes my straight flush.

1898
01:29:53,501 --> 01:29:54,209
What straight flush?

1899
01:29:54,293 --> 01:29:55,168
You're going bust.

1900
01:29:55,251 --> 01:29:56,293
What a joke. No way.

1901
01:29:56,376 --> 01:29:57,209
Mark it down, mark it down.

1902
01:29:57,293 --> 01:29:59,043
Forget it, we're not keeping track.

1903
01:29:59,126 --> 01:30:00,043
No, let's stop playing.

1904
01:30:00,126 --> 01:30:00,876
You can't play this way.

1905
01:30:06,126 --> 01:30:07,376
Miss Wan!

1906
01:30:07,459 --> 01:30:08,459
You're so awesome!

1907
01:30:08,543 --> 01:30:10,043
We miss you!

1908
01:30:10,126 --> 01:30:11,959
You're going to win for sure.

1909
01:30:12,043 --> 01:30:13,251
Where are you guys?

1910
01:30:13,334 --> 01:30:14,334
Having beef noodles at the place

1911
01:30:14,418 --> 01:30:16,168
across from yours.

1912
01:30:16,251 --> 01:30:18,001
Say hi to the boss for me.

1913
01:30:18,334 --> 01:30:20,501
Boss, Miss Wan says "Hi."

1914
01:30:21,251 --> 01:30:22,793
Good, hello.

1915
01:30:24,209 --> 01:30:26,209
I need your help.

1916
01:30:26,293 --> 01:30:27,084
No problem.

1917
01:30:27,168 --> 01:30:27,959
Tell us,

1918
01:30:28,043 --> 01:30:29,793
we'll make sure to deliver.

1919
01:30:29,876 --> 01:30:30,668
You guys are

1920
01:30:30,751 --> 01:30:32,251
internet experts.

1921
01:30:32,334 --> 01:30:35,209
Do you know
where to get traditional soy sauce?

1922
01:30:35,293 --> 01:30:36,376
I also need...

1923
01:30:36,459 --> 01:30:37,376
fresh water chestnuts.

1924
01:30:37,459 --> 01:30:40,793
So you need traditional soy sauce
and water chestnuts?

1925
01:30:40,876 --> 01:30:42,334
When do you need them?

1926
01:30:42,793 --> 01:30:44,751
Soon! The final round's tomorrow.

1927
01:30:44,834 --> 01:30:47,168
No problem! We'll make sure to deliver!

1928
01:30:47,251 --> 01:30:48,459
Search for traditional soy sauce first.

1929
01:30:49,293 --> 01:30:50,418
No need to search!

1930
01:30:51,251 --> 01:30:52,626
The best traditional soy sauce

1931
01:30:52,709 --> 01:30:54,084
is right here with me.

1932
01:30:54,168 --> 01:30:54,959
Wang Chi Dan.

1933
01:30:55,043 --> 01:30:57,001
Shut your mouth!

1934
01:30:57,293 --> 01:30:59,084
The soy sauce belongs to the Wangs.

1935
01:31:00,168 --> 01:31:01,626
I'll do whatever I want with it.

1936
01:31:08,168 --> 01:31:11,084
This soy sauce was handmade
the old fashioned way.

1937
01:31:11,168 --> 01:31:13,418
Based on the Wangs' secret family recipe

1938
01:31:13,501 --> 01:31:16,043
that's over a thousand years old.

1939
01:31:17,668 --> 01:31:19,168
Just a tiny drop of it

1940
01:31:19,251 --> 01:31:20,334
will turn tasteless food

1941
01:31:20,418 --> 01:31:23,084
into a delicacy.

1942
01:31:25,126 --> 01:31:28,251
King Yue once fueled himself
with vengeance

1943
01:31:28,334 --> 01:31:30,418
by eating a raw gall bladder dipped
in our soy sauce.

1944
01:31:30,501 --> 01:31:32,918
It was the only way to take the bitterness.

1945
01:31:36,834 --> 01:31:38,168
The great poet Su

1946
01:31:38,251 --> 01:31:40,709
also used our family's soy sauce

1947
01:31:40,793 --> 01:31:42,751
to create his renowned

1948
01:31:42,834 --> 01:31:44,626
stewed pork recipe.

1949
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:49,043
However,

1950
01:31:50,918 --> 01:31:52,918
no one knows how to make it anymore.

1951
01:31:53,001 --> 01:31:55,251
Ever since my grandmother passed away.

1952
01:31:55,668 --> 01:31:58,293
This is the last jug on earth.

1953
01:32:00,251 --> 01:32:02,043
Take it and give it to Miss Wan!

1954
01:32:03,793 --> 01:32:05,084
You sure?

1955
01:32:06,126 --> 01:32:07,334
What I say goes!

1956
01:32:08,043 --> 01:32:09,584
You're the man!

1957
01:32:11,209 --> 01:32:13,668
But how come your stew isn't so good?

1958
01:32:13,751 --> 01:32:14,668
Yeah.

1959
01:32:14,751 --> 01:32:16,084
Why would I waste my family heirloom

1960
01:32:16,168 --> 01:32:17,334
on you kids?

1961
01:32:18,959 --> 01:32:20,168
We need to find water chestnuts too.

1962
01:32:20,251 --> 01:32:21,876
We have to get going.

1963
01:32:22,168 --> 01:32:22,876
Get out of here.

1964
01:32:32,209 --> 01:32:32,918
Master.

1965
01:32:33,918 --> 01:32:35,251
Hurry, come play.

1966
01:32:35,334 --> 01:32:36,418
Come over here.

1967
01:32:44,834 --> 01:32:45,626
Master,

1968
01:32:45,709 --> 01:32:46,793
we're playing "13 Pieces".

1969
01:32:46,876 --> 01:32:48,043
Did you think we're playing "Go Fish"?

1970
01:32:48,126 --> 01:32:49,918
13 pieces? I only have 8 pieces.

1971
01:32:50,501 --> 01:32:52,043
Hey, we're not playing "Deuces".

1972
01:33:03,626 --> 01:33:04,793
Let's go, let's go.

1973
01:33:09,793 --> 01:33:11,376
Who...

1974
01:33:11,459 --> 01:33:12,584
who's in 608?

1975
01:33:12,918 --> 01:33:13,709
608?

1976
01:33:13,793 --> 01:33:15,709
No one.

1977
01:33:15,793 --> 01:33:17,376
Come with me, bring the key.

1978
01:33:23,418 --> 01:33:24,584
Hey,

1979
01:33:24,668 --> 01:33:26,626
Jaws is coming to get you. Get out.

1980
01:33:27,459 --> 01:33:28,626
Hurry up.

1981
01:33:31,793 --> 01:33:32,709
It's coming!

1982
01:33:33,959 --> 01:33:34,709
Hurry up.

1983
01:33:34,793 --> 01:33:36,418
Go this way.

1984
01:33:36,501 --> 01:33:37,418
Hurry up.

1985
01:33:49,751 --> 01:33:50,959
Mom, keep your voice down.

1986
01:33:51,043 --> 01:33:52,209
You, faster!

1987
01:33:53,751 --> 01:33:54,918
Faster!

1988
01:34:01,834 --> 01:34:03,834
Turns out we can get water chestnuts in
Guan Tian.

1989
01:34:03,918 --> 01:34:05,543
We're lucky it's not far.

1990
01:34:10,334 --> 01:34:11,751
Sir, Sir.

1991
01:34:11,834 --> 01:34:12,918
I'm on Wan's team.

1992
01:34:13,001 --> 01:34:14,334
Can we start our preparation?

1993
01:34:15,543 --> 01:34:16,459
Station 1, station 1

1994
01:34:16,543 --> 01:34:17,501
We have a contestant here,

1995
01:34:17,584 --> 01:34:19,084
can we let them go right now?

1996
01:34:19,168 --> 01:34:20,751
Yeah, please go.

1997
01:34:21,001 --> 01:34:22,168
Thank you how much.

1998
01:34:22,793 --> 01:34:23,334
Okay.

1999
01:34:23,418 --> 01:34:24,459
No more pictures.

2000
01:34:24,543 --> 01:34:25,959
Here, get the ingredients ready.

2001
01:34:26,043 --> 01:34:26,834
Take another one...

2002
01:34:26,918 --> 01:34:27,959
No more.

2003
01:34:28,043 --> 01:34:30,459
Group picture, group picture.

2004
01:34:31,293 --> 01:34:32,043
Hurry up.

2005
01:34:32,126 --> 01:34:33,251
Are you happy?

2006
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:34,918
Happy.

2007
01:34:35,001 --> 01:34:36,251
So what should we do first?

2008
01:34:37,834 --> 01:34:39,001
You can...

2009
01:34:39,084 --> 01:34:41,626
you can start with broth and fish paste.

2010
01:34:42,709 --> 01:34:44,126
What will you do then?

2011
01:34:44,209 --> 01:34:45,751
I'll...

2012
01:34:47,001 --> 01:34:48,918
I'll try the Chrysanthemum with

2013
01:34:49,001 --> 01:34:50,709
Bamboo and Scallop again.

2014
01:34:50,793 --> 01:34:52,793
But you failed last time.

2015
01:34:54,293 --> 01:34:55,751
Well, don't you know?

2016
01:34:55,834 --> 01:34:58,209
Chefs used to try and fail many times

2017
01:34:58,293 --> 01:35:00,168
before they could get a good flavor.

2018
01:35:05,918 --> 01:35:07,293
Sir, can we ask you a question?

2019
01:35:07,376 --> 01:35:07,959
Go ahead.

2020
01:35:08,043 --> 01:35:10,334
Can we find water chestnuts nearby?

2021
01:35:10,418 --> 01:35:11,793
This is the place.

2022
01:35:11,876 --> 01:35:12,626
But,

2023
01:35:12,709 --> 01:35:14,251
they've all been harvested already.

2024
01:35:15,751 --> 01:35:17,043
All gone?

2025
01:35:17,126 --> 01:35:18,459
All gone? Every single one!

2026
01:35:18,543 --> 01:35:20,459
Look around, all the fields are empty.

2027
01:35:20,543 --> 01:35:21,418
All gone.

2028
01:35:21,501 --> 01:35:22,209
There's nothing here either.

2029
01:35:22,293 --> 01:35:23,876
This guy says another place
might have them.

2030
01:35:23,959 --> 01:35:24,626
Where?

2031
01:35:24,709 --> 01:35:25,459
Ming Hsiung in Chia Yi.

2032
01:35:25,543 --> 01:35:26,501
Chia Yi?

2033
01:35:26,584 --> 01:35:28,168
No big deal, let's bolt over there!

2034
01:35:28,251 --> 01:35:29,293
Right! Nothing can stop us.

2035
01:35:29,376 --> 01:35:30,376
Let's go!

2036
01:35:34,959 --> 01:35:35,876
Hold on.

2037
01:35:35,959 --> 01:35:37,084
Where's Demon?

2038
01:35:39,459 --> 01:35:40,918
Demon!

2039
01:35:44,043 --> 01:35:45,459
Demon!

2040
01:35:45,751 --> 01:35:46,959
Demon!

2041
01:35:51,834 --> 01:35:53,293
What happened? Are you okay?

2042
01:35:53,834 --> 01:35:55,459
The soy sauce...

2043
01:35:55,543 --> 01:35:56,918
The last on earth.

2044
01:35:57,001 --> 01:35:58,584
The end of the Wang family.

2045
01:35:59,584 --> 01:36:01,168
Stop crying! Stand up!

2046
01:36:02,126 --> 01:36:04,084
There's still some left inside.

2047
01:36:04,168 --> 01:36:06,168
You better take what's left back to
Mr. Wang.

2048
01:36:06,251 --> 01:36:07,543
It's not enough anyway.

2049
01:36:07,626 --> 01:36:08,751
You have to beg him for forgiveness.

2050
01:36:08,834 --> 01:36:10,001
Put it in this bag.

2051
01:36:19,626 --> 01:36:21,334
Back already?

2052
01:36:21,418 --> 01:36:23,168
Sorry, Mr. Wang.

2053
01:36:23,251 --> 01:36:24,168
It broke...

2054
01:36:24,251 --> 01:36:26,168
only a third is left.

2055
01:36:28,459 --> 01:36:30,168
A third?

2056
01:36:30,709 --> 01:36:32,043
That's enough.

2057
01:36:32,126 --> 01:36:34,251
This soy sauce has thickened into paste,

2058
01:36:34,334 --> 01:36:35,584
it can be diluted.

2059
01:36:35,668 --> 01:36:36,376
Oh?

2060
01:36:40,418 --> 01:36:42,418
If you have soy sauce
that's 2500 years old

2061
01:36:42,501 --> 01:36:44,668
even diluted with water 10 times

2062
01:36:45,043 --> 01:36:46,668
the flavor is still 250 years old!

2063
01:36:46,751 --> 01:36:47,543
Whoa!

2064
01:36:56,209 --> 01:36:58,043
Auntie,

2065
01:36:58,126 --> 01:37:01,293
are there any water chestnuts left?

2066
01:37:01,376 --> 01:37:03,918
All gone! They're not in season.

2067
01:37:05,209 --> 01:37:06,709
Get some cabbage!

2068
01:37:06,793 --> 01:37:09,418
They're the best right now.

2069
01:37:22,584 --> 01:37:23,709
You think cabbage will be okay?

2070
01:37:23,793 --> 01:37:25,584
No problem.
I don't like water chestnuts anyway.

2071
01:37:25,668 --> 01:37:27,709
I like cabbage more too.

2072
01:37:34,793 --> 01:37:35,584
Out of gas.

2073
01:37:35,668 --> 01:37:36,501
What?

2074
01:37:39,876 --> 01:37:40,751
It's hot.

2075
01:37:40,834 --> 01:37:41,376
Come on.

2076
01:37:41,459 --> 01:37:43,543
I think we got it right this time.

2077
01:37:44,793 --> 01:37:46,584
Bamboo and Scallops, version two.

2078
01:37:46,668 --> 01:37:47,168
How is it?

2079
01:37:47,251 --> 01:37:48,001
Fail.

2080
01:37:48,418 --> 01:37:48,834
Fail.

2081
01:37:49,043 --> 01:37:49,834
Fail.

2082
01:37:51,334 --> 01:37:53,126
Is it that bad?

2083
01:37:53,209 --> 01:37:55,001
What did I do wrong?

2084
01:37:55,084 --> 01:37:56,876
It's missing some flavor.

2085
01:37:56,959 --> 01:37:58,501
Don't worry. Let's make rump roast first.

2086
01:37:58,584 --> 01:37:59,751
Okay.

2087
01:37:59,834 --> 01:38:02,084
I wonder
if they found traditional soy sauce?

2088
01:38:02,168 --> 01:38:03,126
I'll call them.

2089
01:38:19,918 --> 01:38:21,168
I can't tell what's missing at all.

2090
01:38:21,251 --> 01:38:21,959
Hard to tell.

2091
01:38:22,043 --> 01:38:22,584
Weird.

2092
01:38:22,668 --> 01:38:25,376
I called Demon but it's not going through.

2093
01:38:26,418 --> 01:38:27,459
Don't worry.

2094
01:38:29,418 --> 01:38:32,709
I can tell you
if they will successfully deliver.

2095
01:38:34,293 --> 01:38:36,584
Please pick 3 cards from the deck.

2096
01:38:41,084 --> 01:38:42,084
You see!

2097
01:38:42,168 --> 01:38:44,293
Clubs mean vegetables.

2098
01:38:44,376 --> 01:38:45,501
Queen means Cubic basket.

2099
01:38:45,584 --> 01:38:48,751
It says there is a basket of vegetables.

2100
01:38:52,834 --> 01:38:54,376
Why did you pick the highway route?

2101
01:38:54,459 --> 01:38:56,084
I thought we'd go faster on a bigger road.

2102
01:38:56,168 --> 01:38:57,918
Every road leads to Taipei.

2103
01:39:05,126 --> 01:39:06,376
What the hell?

2104
01:39:06,459 --> 01:39:07,668
Every road leads to your asshole.

2105
01:39:22,751 --> 01:39:24,626
The Jack of Clubs.

2106
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:25,626
What color is it?

2107
01:39:25,709 --> 01:39:26,751
Black black black.

2108
01:39:26,834 --> 01:39:27,418
Right,

2109
01:39:27,501 --> 01:39:29,418
what's the color of soy sauce?

2110
01:39:29,501 --> 01:39:30,459
Black black black.

2111
01:39:30,543 --> 01:39:31,501
And doesn't the shape

2112
01:39:31,584 --> 01:39:32,834
of the letter J

2113
01:39:32,918 --> 01:39:35,334
look like soy sauce pouring out?

2114
01:39:35,793 --> 01:39:37,459
Black black black.

2115
01:39:44,293 --> 01:39:45,668
And...

2116
01:39:45,751 --> 01:39:46,876
King.

2117
01:39:46,959 --> 01:39:47,959
A King has noble supporters!

2118
01:39:48,043 --> 01:39:49,418
And the number 13,

2119
01:39:49,501 --> 01:39:50,709
13 means lots of them.

2120
01:39:50,793 --> 01:39:53,709
It means many noble supporters.

2121
01:40:34,751 --> 01:40:36,668
Over here!

2122
01:41:09,084 --> 01:41:11,293
Why don't you ever carry your wallet?

2123
01:41:11,376 --> 01:41:12,501
I assume you'll have yours.

2124
01:41:12,584 --> 01:41:14,043
I spent all my money on cabbage.

2125
01:41:14,126 --> 01:41:16,001
Any ideas on how we'll pay for the gas?

2126
01:41:26,126 --> 01:41:28,251
Buying betel nuts, handsome?

2127
01:41:28,334 --> 01:41:29,793
Can I go online for a second?

2128
01:41:29,876 --> 01:41:30,834
Okay, sure.

2129
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:31,751
Thanks.

2130
01:41:34,043 --> 01:41:35,959
Bamboo and Scallop version 5, fail.

2131
01:41:39,501 --> 01:41:41,793
Okay, let's just take turns sleeping.

2132
01:41:41,876 --> 01:41:43,543
You can go first and sleep in the van.

2133
01:41:44,043 --> 01:41:45,126
What about you?

2134
01:41:46,001 --> 01:41:46,918
I have to do something.

2135
01:41:47,668 --> 01:41:48,501
You've been acting mysterious

2136
01:41:48,584 --> 01:41:50,043
and disappearing a lot.

2137
01:41:50,126 --> 01:41:51,751
Did you go back to being an AV actress?

2138
01:41:53,793 --> 01:41:55,793
Can't take a joke?

2139
01:42:09,876 --> 01:42:11,168
You're here.

2140
01:42:11,251 --> 01:42:12,001
Yep,

2141
01:42:12,084 --> 01:42:13,584
what's going on today?

2142
01:42:14,043 --> 01:42:15,376
I'm catering!

2143
01:42:15,459 --> 01:42:16,668
Catering?

2144
01:42:17,668 --> 01:42:19,251
Hurry, come help.

2145
01:42:19,876 --> 01:42:21,418
Yes Master! Your Stooge is here.

2146
01:42:21,501 --> 01:42:22,626
Good girl.

2147
01:42:26,043 --> 01:42:27,251
What's this?

2148
01:42:27,334 --> 01:42:28,501
Some leftover Salted Fried Chicken I got.

2149
01:42:28,584 --> 01:42:29,459
I'm going to use it to make

2150
01:42:29,543 --> 01:42:32,126
Eggplant with 3 Flavor Chicken.

2151
01:42:33,709 --> 01:42:35,251
Can you mix them up like that?

2152
01:42:35,334 --> 01:42:36,126
Why not?

2153
01:42:36,209 --> 01:42:38,709
There are no rules
about what goes together.

2154
01:42:43,001 --> 01:42:44,459
Now, Leftover Salty Congee.

2155
01:42:44,959 --> 01:42:46,418
Come, everyone!

2156
01:42:47,334 --> 01:42:48,709
Let the banquet begin.

2157
01:42:49,376 --> 01:42:50,751
Let the banquet begin.

2158
01:42:51,084 --> 01:42:52,459
I'd like to toast you all.

2159
01:42:53,001 --> 01:42:55,543
Today is a really special banquet.

2160
01:42:55,626 --> 01:42:56,626
Thanks.

2161
01:42:56,709 --> 01:42:57,834
Thanks, everyone.

2162
01:42:58,584 --> 01:42:59,876
I'll tell you something.

2163
01:42:59,959 --> 01:43:01,209
In the old days of catering,

2164
01:43:01,293 --> 01:43:03,084
a master would show up

2165
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:04,293
with only his utensils.

2166
01:43:04,376 --> 01:43:05,043
Did you know that?

2167
01:43:05,126 --> 01:43:05,626
I didn't know.

2168
01:43:05,709 --> 01:43:06,959
You didn't?

2169
01:43:07,043 --> 01:43:07,793
Come with me.

2170
01:43:07,876 --> 01:43:08,751
I'll tell you more.

2171
01:43:09,668 --> 01:43:10,876
You guys enjoy the meal.

2172
01:43:12,959 --> 01:43:15,168
In the old days, a catering master

2173
01:43:15,251 --> 01:43:17,459
would leave home
with only his cooking utensils.

2174
01:43:17,543 --> 01:43:18,501
Just knives and sieves.

2175
01:43:18,584 --> 01:43:20,959
No need to bring anything else.

2176
01:43:21,251 --> 01:43:22,709
He'd also bring an apprentice

2177
01:43:22,793 --> 01:43:23,959
who didn't bring anything either

2178
01:43:24,043 --> 01:43:25,334
except for the cooking utensils.

2179
01:43:25,918 --> 01:43:27,876
When he came to the host's home

2180
01:43:28,751 --> 01:43:30,293
the host would have everything ready.

2181
01:43:30,376 --> 01:43:32,251
All the ingredients would be there.

2182
01:43:32,334 --> 01:43:33,834
Neighbors would offer fish and vegetables

2183
01:43:33,918 --> 01:43:35,459
if they could.

2184
01:43:35,543 --> 01:43:36,709
Most importantly,

2185
01:43:36,793 --> 01:43:39,084
all tables, chairs, bowls and plates

2186
01:43:39,168 --> 01:43:41,293
were borrowed from neighbors.

2187
01:43:41,376 --> 01:43:42,751
You drew all these.

2188
01:43:42,834 --> 01:43:43,876
No big deal!

2189
01:43:43,959 --> 01:43:45,334
They're just for fun.

2190
01:43:45,959 --> 01:43:46,709
Look.

2191
01:43:46,876 --> 01:43:47,418
Here.

2192
01:43:47,501 --> 01:43:48,334
If a pig was sacrificed,

2193
01:43:48,418 --> 01:43:50,668
the catering master would

2194
01:43:50,751 --> 01:43:52,584
divide up the meat perfectly.

2195
01:43:52,668 --> 01:43:53,668
He had to get it right.

2196
01:43:54,084 --> 01:43:55,626
Both he and his apprentice

2197
01:43:55,709 --> 01:43:57,751
would then start cooking together.

2198
01:43:57,834 --> 01:43:59,376
Country folk back then

2199
01:43:59,459 --> 01:44:01,168
only had a few good meals a year.

2200
01:44:01,251 --> 01:44:03,168
Everyone came out and were so happy.

2201
01:44:03,251 --> 01:44:03,834
Look at you, Stooge.

2202
01:44:03,918 --> 01:44:04,918
You did a lot today.

2203
01:44:05,001 --> 01:44:06,209
Helping me out.

2204
01:44:06,293 --> 01:44:08,084
Everybody helped out and looked happy.

2205
01:44:08,168 --> 01:44:09,251
Then the banquet started.

2206
01:44:09,334 --> 01:44:10,668
What was the banquet for?

2207
01:44:10,751 --> 01:44:12,043
A wedding.

2208
01:44:12,126 --> 01:44:14,876
And the newlyweds really loved it.

2209
01:44:14,959 --> 01:44:18,334
Then the desserts
and fireworks as the ending notes.

2210
01:44:18,418 --> 01:44:19,918
The guests all enjoyed the food.

2211
01:44:20,001 --> 01:44:22,168
The host was very honored in the end.

2212
01:44:22,251 --> 01:44:24,459
He would give an entire chicken

2213
01:44:24,543 --> 01:44:25,959
or a piece of pork

2214
01:44:26,043 --> 01:44:27,834
to the catering master.

2215
01:44:28,418 --> 01:44:30,751
What else would the catering master get?

2216
01:44:30,834 --> 01:44:32,376
He would get...

2217
01:44:32,459 --> 01:44:33,959
affection

2218
01:44:34,043 --> 01:44:35,626
and appreciation.

2219
01:44:36,001 --> 01:44:36,543
More importantly,

2220
01:44:36,626 --> 01:44:38,793
he was happy and satisfied in his heart.

2221
01:44:40,001 --> 01:44:41,334
Is that

2222
01:44:41,418 --> 01:44:42,876
the traditional heart?

2223
01:44:43,501 --> 01:44:46,626
That's the traditional catering master.

2224
01:44:47,001 --> 01:44:49,334
But that time

2225
01:44:50,376 --> 01:44:51,876
has long gone.

2226
01:44:52,334 --> 01:44:53,334
Come on, let's go.

2227
01:45:01,251 --> 01:45:03,209
Daughter of Master Fly Spirit,

2228
01:45:03,293 --> 01:45:05,626
I can't teach you how to cook his dishes.

2229
01:45:05,709 --> 01:45:07,376
I can only give you this.

2230
01:45:10,459 --> 01:45:11,709
What is it?

2231
01:45:11,793 --> 01:45:14,084
It's a dried turnip aged for 40 years.

2232
01:45:15,251 --> 01:45:16,418
How do I use it?

2233
01:45:18,918 --> 01:45:20,168
We have our hands,

2234
01:45:20,251 --> 01:45:21,709
and they have their mouths.

2235
01:45:21,793 --> 01:45:23,459
No matter how good your cooking is,

2236
01:45:23,543 --> 01:45:25,584
you can't satisfy everyone.

2237
01:45:25,668 --> 01:45:28,334
But if your heart is full of joy,

2238
01:45:28,418 --> 01:45:30,043
the food will taste good.

2239
01:45:31,834 --> 01:45:32,876
Thank you.

2240
01:45:33,168 --> 01:45:34,584
No thank you.

2241
01:45:47,126 --> 01:45:48,918
Uncle!

2242
01:45:49,001 --> 01:45:50,543
You surf the web, too?

2243
01:45:51,084 --> 01:45:53,584
Live to learn and learn to live.

2244
01:46:00,793 --> 01:46:01,876
Demon!

2245
01:46:01,959 --> 01:46:03,543
So cool!

2246
01:48:02,834 --> 01:48:05,459
(The Leftover Stew)

2247
01:48:47,001 --> 01:48:53,168
Miss Wan!

2248
01:49:23,626 --> 01:49:24,501
Ladies and gentlemen,

2249
01:49:24,584 --> 01:49:27,001
today is the final round of the contest.

2250
01:49:27,084 --> 01:49:29,876
Both finalists
have already started preparing.

2251
01:49:29,959 --> 01:49:32,293
The Banquet Contest starts at 6 tonight.

2252
01:49:38,918 --> 01:49:39,793
Stooge B,

2253
01:49:39,876 --> 01:49:41,209
how's it coming along?

2254
01:49:41,293 --> 01:49:43,626
Finished 20, 2 more to go.

2255
01:49:44,376 --> 01:49:45,709
I knew you'd be great.

2256
01:49:45,793 --> 01:49:46,501
Keep at it.

2257
01:49:46,584 --> 01:49:47,834
Hey hey hey.

2258
01:49:47,918 --> 01:49:48,668
And you?

2259
01:49:48,751 --> 01:49:50,293
I don't know what I did to deserve this.

2260
01:49:50,376 --> 01:49:51,834
Having to stuff turtles into chickens.

2261
01:49:52,334 --> 01:49:52,918
Oh no!

2262
01:49:53,001 --> 01:49:54,084
It ripped apart!

2263
01:49:54,668 --> 01:49:55,834
Ripped apart?

2264
01:50:00,834 --> 01:50:02,751
You know how hard I tried?

2265
01:50:02,834 --> 01:50:05,084
And you ripped it right away!

2266
01:50:05,168 --> 01:50:07,084
It ripped. What can I do?

2267
01:50:08,126 --> 01:50:09,418
Hey hey hey.

2268
01:50:09,793 --> 01:50:10,668
Okay! Okay!

2269
01:50:10,751 --> 01:50:12,126
No time to get mad.

2270
01:50:12,209 --> 01:50:13,501
You go help wash the vegetables. Go.

2271
01:50:13,584 --> 01:50:16,209
Damn, do you think I'm some trainee?

2272
01:50:16,293 --> 01:50:18,084
I'm not even getting paid.

2273
01:50:18,168 --> 01:50:19,293
And I have to do everything.

2274
01:50:19,376 --> 01:50:20,543
Shut up.

2275
01:50:24,709 --> 01:50:26,709
We need more helpers.

2276
01:50:26,793 --> 01:50:28,834
Should we get Animals on Call to help?

2277
01:50:28,918 --> 01:50:29,834
No,

2278
01:50:29,918 --> 01:50:31,584
they have a special task.

2279
01:50:32,501 --> 01:50:33,918
What now?

2280
01:50:36,751 --> 01:50:37,626
Hey hey.

2281
01:50:39,501 --> 01:50:41,168
Rosemary,

2282
01:50:41,251 --> 01:50:42,918
Can you come help?

2283
01:50:44,376 --> 01:50:46,168
Any pay?

2284
01:50:46,251 --> 01:50:47,584
Yes, prize money!

2285
01:50:47,668 --> 01:50:48,168
Really?

2286
01:50:48,251 --> 01:50:49,001
Um.

2287
01:50:51,751 --> 01:50:52,709
Come on.

2288
01:50:55,834 --> 01:50:58,626
Rosemary, help wash the vegetables.

2289
01:50:58,709 --> 01:51:00,334
After that, you can do fish paste...

2290
01:51:00,418 --> 01:51:01,293
Go away.

2291
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:03,043
What are you doing?
I asked you to wash...

2292
01:51:03,334 --> 01:51:05,209
I've watched for a while.
You're doing it all wrong.

2293
01:51:06,168 --> 01:51:07,334
What are you doing?

2294
01:51:08,043 --> 01:51:09,334
You have to out the turtle

2295
01:51:10,834 --> 01:51:12,043
into big pieces before you

2296
01:51:12,126 --> 01:51:13,251
put it inside the chicken

2297
01:51:13,334 --> 01:51:15,376
and then into the pork belly.

2298
01:51:16,376 --> 01:51:18,209
That's easy. You should've told us earlier.

2299
01:51:18,293 --> 01:51:20,084
You could have prevented our fight.

2300
01:51:20,168 --> 01:51:21,293
That's right.

2301
01:51:21,376 --> 01:51:22,751
Hey hey hey.

2302
01:51:22,834 --> 01:51:24,668
How do you know all this?

2303
01:51:24,751 --> 01:51:25,584
When Grandpa made it before,

2304
01:51:25,668 --> 01:51:27,251
I watched.

2305
01:51:27,834 --> 01:51:28,793
WC!

2306
01:51:28,876 --> 01:51:30,334
Then...can you make

2307
01:51:30,418 --> 01:51:32,376
Chrysanthemum with Bamboo
and Scallop?

2308
01:51:33,918 --> 01:51:35,543
Easy.

2309
01:51:35,626 --> 01:51:36,668
Really?

2310
01:51:43,168 --> 01:51:44,418
It's missing shrimp paste.

2311
01:51:45,501 --> 01:51:47,043
That's the missing flavor,

2312
01:51:47,126 --> 01:51:48,251
shrimp paste.

2313
01:51:48,959 --> 01:51:49,959
Rosemary,

2314
01:51:50,043 --> 01:51:52,001
you're amazing.

2315
01:51:52,251 --> 01:51:54,251
Master Tiger Nose passed it all on to you.

2316
01:51:54,334 --> 01:51:55,751
You're a national treasure.

2317
01:51:55,834 --> 01:51:56,751
Okay.

2318
01:51:57,418 --> 01:51:57,751
Okay.

2319
01:51:57,834 --> 01:51:59,418
Let's do what Rosemary does.

2320
01:51:59,501 --> 01:52:01,584
Or we'll be out of time.
There are a lot of tables.

2321
01:52:01,668 --> 01:52:02,501
Right.

2322
01:52:02,584 --> 01:52:04,251
We also have to make Rump Roast
and Shark Fin.

2323
01:52:04,334 --> 01:52:05,001
Right.

2324
01:52:05,084 --> 01:52:06,418
We don't have shark fin.

2325
01:52:06,793 --> 01:52:07,959
What should we do?

2326
01:52:10,751 --> 01:52:11,834
We'll have to rely on this.

2327
01:52:11,918 --> 01:52:14,459
Wang family's 2500 year old soy sauce.

2328
01:52:21,084 --> 01:52:22,209
5!

2329
01:52:22,293 --> 01:52:23,459
4!

2330
01:52:23,543 --> 01:52:24,709
3!

2331
01:52:24,793 --> 01:52:25,876
2!

2332
01:52:25,959 --> 01:52:27,251
1 !

2333
01:52:33,418 --> 01:52:36,084
The final round
of the First Taiwan Catering Contest

2334
01:52:36,168 --> 01:52:39,001
has begun.

2335
01:52:49,626 --> 01:52:51,918
Chairman Hsu,
let me introduce the most senior

2336
01:52:52,001 --> 01:52:54,043
catering master, a national treasure,

2337
01:52:54,126 --> 01:52:55,251
Master Tiger Nose.

2338
01:52:55,334 --> 01:52:57,501
I especially arranged for him
to sit with you.

2339
01:53:00,334 --> 01:53:01,793
It's an honor.

2340
01:53:03,584 --> 01:53:06,334
There will be 3 judges today

2341
01:53:06,418 --> 01:53:10,168
who are renowned gourmet experts.

2342
01:53:10,251 --> 01:53:12,126
He's known as King Picky from Hell:

2343
01:53:12,209 --> 01:53:13,376
Judge King.

2344
01:53:14,251 --> 01:53:16,251
He's called the biggest Chow hound
on Earth:

2345
01:53:16,334 --> 01:53:18,751
Judge Liu.

2346
01:53:18,834 --> 01:53:21,668
She's known as Madam Ruthless:

2347
01:53:21,751 --> 01:53:22,876
Judge Jiang.

2348
01:53:22,959 --> 01:53:26,459
I'll now introduce our finalists.

2349
01:53:26,543 --> 01:53:28,709
Master Wan and her team.

2350
01:53:29,918 --> 01:53:31,834
It's so embarrassing wearing this.

2351
01:53:31,918 --> 01:53:34,876
And Master Tsai and his team.

2352
01:53:34,959 --> 01:53:36,459
Let's welcome them.

2353
01:53:36,959 --> 01:53:38,251
Look at those two traitors.

2354
01:53:49,501 --> 01:53:52,293
The most special thing about today:

2355
01:53:52,376 --> 01:53:54,959
Is that this old couple are newlyweds.

2356
01:53:55,043 --> 01:53:56,459
After being apart for 50 years,

2357
01:53:56,543 --> 01:53:58,418
they're finally getting married today.

2358
01:53:58,918 --> 01:54:00,709
They'll here for their wedding banquet,

2359
01:54:00,793 --> 01:54:02,543
catered by Master Wan.

2360
01:54:02,626 --> 01:54:03,709
So today really is

2361
01:54:03,793 --> 01:54:05,834
a catered banquet.

2362
01:54:08,293 --> 01:54:09,876
Thanks, thanks.

2363
01:54:12,168 --> 01:54:15,084
Let's welcome
the beautiful Madam Director

2364
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:16,543
to kick off the event.

2365
01:54:16,626 --> 01:54:17,209
Madam Director.

2366
01:54:17,293 --> 01:54:17,834
Thank you.

2367
01:54:18,751 --> 01:54:20,001
Let the banquet...

2368
01:54:20,084 --> 01:54:22,043
begin!

2369
01:54:22,334 --> 01:54:23,709
Master Tsai is now ready

2370
01:54:23,793 --> 01:54:25,668
to serve his first course.

2371
01:54:25,751 --> 01:54:26,793
Master Tsai, please.

2372
01:54:26,876 --> 01:54:27,543
Chicken Belly Turtle.

2373
01:54:27,626 --> 01:54:28,293
Hurry.

2374
01:54:29,459 --> 01:54:30,834
Chicken Belly Turtle.

2375
01:54:33,168 --> 01:54:34,418
They all look good!

2376
01:54:34,501 --> 01:54:35,418
Nice!

2377
01:54:35,501 --> 01:54:36,043
Hey hey hey.

2378
01:54:36,126 --> 01:54:36,834
Great!

2379
01:54:37,418 --> 01:54:38,584
Master Tsai, would you please tell us

2380
01:54:38,668 --> 01:54:40,209
the name of this course?

2381
01:54:40,293 --> 01:54:41,501
It's called 5 Color Firework.

2382
01:54:44,709 --> 01:54:46,543
What's inside this sprout?

2383
01:54:46,626 --> 01:54:47,834
Shark fin.

2384
01:54:48,334 --> 01:54:49,376
You can put shark fin...

2385
01:54:49,459 --> 01:54:52,084
inside a sprout?

2386
01:54:52,168 --> 01:54:55,584
Inside you'll also find scallion,
mushroom, or ham.

2387
01:54:55,668 --> 01:54:58,168
Master Tsai, very impressive.

2388
01:54:58,459 --> 01:54:59,209
Wonderful!

2389
01:55:00,876 --> 01:55:02,543
Okay, now let's look at what

2390
01:55:02,626 --> 01:55:04,293
Master Wan is serving.

2391
01:55:04,376 --> 01:55:05,501
Master Wan, please

2392
01:55:06,376 --> 01:55:06,918
Master Wan,

2393
01:55:07,001 --> 01:55:08,834
what's this course called?

2394
01:55:08,918 --> 01:55:10,376
This is a traditional course.

2395
01:55:10,459 --> 01:55:12,876
Called Chicken Belly Turtle.

2396
01:55:12,959 --> 01:55:16,959
There's a chicken inside a pork belly and

2397
01:55:17,043 --> 01:55:19,209
inside the chicken you'll also find turtle.

2398
01:55:20,251 --> 01:55:22,043
There's aged dried turnip in it.

2399
01:55:22,126 --> 01:55:27,209
It adds more flavor and depth

2400
01:55:27,293 --> 01:55:28,834
to this traditional course.

2401
01:55:28,918 --> 01:55:30,418
Really wonderful.

2402
01:55:30,501 --> 01:55:32,584
Judges,

2403
01:55:32,668 --> 01:55:35,293
please show your winner for this course.

2404
01:55:38,751 --> 01:55:40,418
The result is 2 to 1 .

2405
01:55:40,501 --> 01:55:42,251
Master Wan wins this course.

2406
01:55:42,334 --> 01:55:43,918
Congratulations!

2407
01:55:44,001 --> 01:55:44,668
Okay.

2408
01:55:44,751 --> 01:55:47,543
Master Wan will start the second course.

2409
01:55:47,959 --> 01:55:49,459
Nice!
Come on and get the next course out.

2410
01:55:49,543 --> 01:55:50,501
Coming.

2411
01:56:05,209 --> 01:56:05,959
Here, Master Wan.

2412
01:56:06,043 --> 01:56:08,209
The second course is here.

2413
01:56:09,376 --> 01:56:10,918
Beautiful Chrysanthemum.

2414
01:56:11,001 --> 01:56:12,751
And it looks very elegant.

2415
01:56:12,834 --> 01:56:13,501
Master Wan,

2416
01:56:13,584 --> 01:56:15,543
what's this course called?

2417
01:56:15,626 --> 01:56:17,584
Chrysanthemum with
Bamboo and Scallop.

2418
01:56:20,334 --> 01:56:21,543
It gives me a feeling

2419
01:56:21,626 --> 01:56:22,959
of beautiful sunshine.

2420
01:56:26,876 --> 01:56:28,626
The flavor is like sunshine,

2421
01:56:28,709 --> 01:56:30,376
fresh flowers,

2422
01:56:30,459 --> 01:56:32,543
and youth.

2423
01:56:32,626 --> 01:56:35,293
Really, really refreshing!

2424
01:57:04,751 --> 01:57:07,376
It's like falling in love for the first time.

2425
01:57:07,959 --> 01:57:08,918
Young Chairman Hsu

2426
01:57:09,001 --> 01:57:10,751
must have had many admirers.

2427
01:57:12,626 --> 01:57:14,376
No one as beautiful as you though.

2428
01:57:14,459 --> 01:57:16,251
You're too kind.

2429
01:57:21,876 --> 01:57:22,751
Master Tsai,

2430
01:57:22,834 --> 01:57:23,793
may I ask what your next course

2431
01:57:23,876 --> 01:57:25,293
is called?

2432
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:27,084
Ghost Knocking Walls.

2433
01:57:30,418 --> 01:57:32,168
The meat has a very special flavor
and texture.

2434
01:57:32,251 --> 01:57:35,668
In between there are slices of sugar
in wine.

2435
01:57:35,751 --> 01:57:38,293
It turns to sauce with just a little heat.

2436
01:57:39,501 --> 01:57:41,293
Really marvelous.

2437
01:57:41,376 --> 01:57:45,418
It's really like a ghost knocking walls!

2438
01:57:55,251 --> 01:57:56,876
Are you three okay?

2439
01:57:59,959 --> 01:58:01,793
Now let's see who our judges

2440
01:58:01,876 --> 01:58:03,668
have picked as the winner.

2441
01:58:08,834 --> 01:58:11,084
Master Tsai is the winner!

2442
01:58:11,876 --> 01:58:13,251
Do you even know how to eat?

2443
01:58:13,334 --> 01:58:14,459
Impossible.

2444
01:58:14,543 --> 01:58:15,418
Okay okay.

2445
01:58:15,501 --> 01:58:17,168
Get ready for the next course. Come on.

2446
01:58:17,501 --> 01:58:18,709
The next course is

2447
01:58:18,793 --> 01:58:20,084
Rump Roast.

2448
01:58:20,168 --> 01:58:22,126
Eat Rump Roast, keep your pants on,

2449
01:58:22,209 --> 01:58:24,376
you'll be rich!

2450
01:58:26,251 --> 01:58:28,251
This was braised
with traditional soy sauce,

2451
01:58:28,334 --> 01:58:30,334
over 2500 years old.

2452
01:58:30,418 --> 01:58:34,001
Amazing.

2453
01:58:35,918 --> 01:58:37,251
This pork

2454
01:58:37,334 --> 01:58:39,459
is no ordinary rump.

2455
01:58:39,543 --> 01:58:40,959
It's alive!

2456
01:58:41,043 --> 01:58:42,251
It's alive!

2457
01:58:42,334 --> 01:58:46,084
It's coming back to life.

2458
01:58:50,293 --> 01:58:51,459
Let's see what Master Tsai is serving

2459
01:58:51,543 --> 01:58:53,376
to compete.

2460
01:58:53,459 --> 01:58:55,043
Devil's Tear Drop.

2461
01:58:55,126 --> 01:58:56,543
Who knew

2462
01:58:56,626 --> 01:58:59,043
the Devil's tear drops were red?

2463
01:59:01,668 --> 01:59:04,209
Electricity

2464
01:59:04,293 --> 01:59:07,209
is flowing from head to toe.

2465
01:59:08,084 --> 01:59:11,168
There's definitely current flowing down
from my head.

2466
01:59:11,251 --> 01:59:12,418
But

2467
01:59:12,501 --> 01:59:14,459
it stops halfway down.

2468
01:59:14,876 --> 01:59:16,293
How come?

2469
01:59:16,376 --> 01:59:18,751
Can't you see I'm paralyzed waist down?

2470
01:59:20,293 --> 01:59:21,918
What the heck!

2471
01:59:23,626 --> 01:59:25,751
Master Tsai wins!

2472
01:59:27,543 --> 01:59:29,168
What?

2473
01:59:29,251 --> 01:59:30,293
Go!

2474
01:59:30,376 --> 01:59:30,709
Go!

2475
01:59:30,793 --> 01:59:31,793
That's right. Go!

2476
01:59:31,876 --> 01:59:32,793
Go!

2477
01:59:36,626 --> 01:59:38,501
Hsia,

2478
01:59:38,584 --> 01:59:40,001
don't be too sad.

2479
01:59:41,168 --> 01:59:42,501
Someone might have hurt you,

2480
01:59:42,584 --> 01:59:44,459
but there's someone else waiting.

2481
01:59:45,793 --> 01:59:46,918
Master Tiger Nose,

2482
01:59:47,001 --> 01:59:48,709
I'm not Hsia.

2483
01:59:49,668 --> 01:59:51,293
Which Hsia are you talking about?

2484
01:59:51,376 --> 01:59:52,126
Chiu...

2485
01:59:52,209 --> 01:59:53,584
Chiu Yue Hsia!

2486
01:59:54,418 --> 01:59:56,626
The one with a mole right here.

2487
01:59:56,709 --> 01:59:58,376
Chiu Yue Hsia?

2488
01:59:58,751 --> 01:59:59,501
Move it, move it.

2489
01:59:59,584 --> 02:00:00,918
Ready to serve Cabbage Stew.

2490
02:00:01,001 --> 02:00:01,668
Take all of it.

2491
02:00:01,751 --> 02:00:03,001
Hold it. Hold it.

2492
02:00:03,709 --> 02:00:05,668
Cabbage Stew
goes to the old couple's table.

2493
02:00:05,751 --> 02:00:06,834
I want to do Fried River Eels.

2494
02:00:08,168 --> 02:00:09,293
Are you sure?

2495
02:00:09,876 --> 02:00:10,418
Yes.

2496
02:00:11,793 --> 02:00:13,168
I'll do it on stage.

2497
02:00:14,959 --> 02:00:15,793
Nice!

2498
02:00:15,876 --> 02:00:17,376
Hey hey hey.

2499
02:00:17,918 --> 02:00:19,501
Okay, move everything

2500
02:00:19,584 --> 02:00:20,418
onto the stage.

2501
02:00:20,501 --> 02:00:21,043
Okay.

2502
02:00:21,126 --> 02:00:21,626
Let's be quick.

2503
02:00:21,709 --> 02:00:23,334
Master Wan,

2504
02:00:23,418 --> 02:00:24,709
what are you working on now?

2505
02:00:25,001 --> 02:00:26,001
Fried River Eels.

2506
02:00:26,084 --> 02:00:27,251
Fried River Eels, it is.

2507
02:00:27,334 --> 02:00:28,376
Fried River Eels.

2508
02:00:30,501 --> 02:00:31,751
Everyone,

2509
02:00:31,834 --> 02:00:34,376
Master Wan will now perform

2510
02:00:34,459 --> 02:00:35,376
a very difficult course.

2511
02:00:35,459 --> 02:00:38,459
Fried River Eels!

2512
02:00:40,626 --> 02:00:42,376
Dear honored guest,

2513
02:00:42,459 --> 02:00:45,168
Fried River Eels may sound simple to you.

2514
02:00:45,251 --> 02:00:47,459
But it's not easy to make at all.

2515
02:00:47,543 --> 02:00:48,751
It has to be done within 27 seconds

2516
02:00:48,834 --> 02:00:50,709
with the biggest possible fire.

2517
02:00:51,209 --> 02:00:52,084
Tonight

2518
02:00:52,168 --> 02:00:53,293
we have

2519
02:00:53,376 --> 02:00:55,709
the beautiful Master Wan

2520
02:00:55,793 --> 02:00:57,168
risking her life

2521
02:00:57,251 --> 02:01:00,418
to fry river eels for all you guest.

2522
02:01:00,501 --> 02:01:03,459
Let's all give her a big hand.

2523
02:01:05,001 --> 02:01:05,876
Turn off the light!

2524
02:01:15,959 --> 02:01:16,751
Put it in!

2525
02:01:57,334 --> 02:01:57,959
More!

2526
02:01:58,043 --> 02:01:58,751
Oh, okay.

2527
02:02:10,334 --> 02:02:11,293
Rosemary!

2528
02:02:44,959 --> 02:02:46,501
WC!

2529
02:02:46,584 --> 02:02:51,001
This is really amazing!

2530
02:02:54,876 --> 02:02:55,959
WC!

2531
02:02:56,043 --> 02:02:57,293
Smells so good.

2532
02:02:57,376 --> 02:02:59,834
Try it when it's hot.

2533
02:03:31,001 --> 02:03:33,001
What a very impressive course.

2534
02:03:33,084 --> 02:03:34,959
Master Tsai, Master Tsai.

2535
02:03:35,043 --> 02:03:36,543
Master Tsai, hurry up.

2536
02:03:36,626 --> 02:03:39,084
These Fried River Eels are very good.

2537
02:03:40,084 --> 02:03:42,751
You're using a potted plant against it?

2538
02:03:42,834 --> 02:03:45,626
This course is called No Complaints,
No Regrets.

2539
02:03:46,084 --> 02:03:47,418
No Complaints, No Regrets?

2540
02:03:47,959 --> 02:03:49,876
This arrangement's beautiful!

2541
02:03:49,959 --> 02:03:51,626
But what's the meaning?

2542
02:03:52,001 --> 02:03:54,293
A Master taught me how to make it

2543
02:03:54,376 --> 02:03:56,168
From a life-time of experience and skill.

2544
02:03:56,251 --> 02:03:57,876
After having made this course,

2545
02:03:57,959 --> 02:03:58,918
his life would be free

2546
02:03:59,001 --> 02:04:00,709
of regrets and grudges.

2547
02:04:00,959 --> 02:04:02,168
What kind of stuffing is in these?

2548
02:04:02,251 --> 02:04:04,543
5 kinds: Sour, Sweet, Bitter,
Hot, and Numb.

2549
02:04:06,418 --> 02:04:10,334
It really covers all flavors of life.

2550
02:04:10,418 --> 02:04:11,543
Ladies and Gentlemen,

2551
02:04:11,626 --> 02:04:13,584
do you pref or Fried River Eels

2552
02:04:13,668 --> 02:04:15,418
or No Complaints, No Regrets?

2553
02:04:15,668 --> 02:04:16,876
Show your decision, please.

2554
02:04:20,334 --> 02:04:22,751
Master Wan wins, congratulations.

2555
02:04:24,751 --> 02:04:25,459
Brother Tsai.

2556
02:04:25,543 --> 02:04:26,751
Yes.

2557
02:04:26,834 --> 02:04:28,834
Let me do the last course!

2558
02:04:28,918 --> 02:04:29,709
Last course?

2559
02:04:29,793 --> 02:04:31,501
Isn't it Heaven of ice and Fire?

2560
02:04:32,084 --> 02:04:33,459
I change my mind.

2561
02:04:33,543 --> 02:04:34,751
I want to do my own course.

2562
02:04:34,834 --> 02:04:36,584
You must be kidding.

2563
02:04:36,668 --> 02:04:38,126
Not to let you experiment.

2564
02:04:38,209 --> 02:04:39,918
Not to let you experiment.

2565
02:04:40,459 --> 02:04:41,959
What exactly do you want to make?

2566
02:04:43,168 --> 02:04:44,543
Scrambled Tomato and Eggs.

2567
02:04:45,001 --> 02:04:46,043
Scrambled Tomato and Eggs?

2568
02:04:46,126 --> 02:04:47,376
Are you crazy?

2569
02:04:47,459 --> 02:04:50,209
You want to make that dish
for the contest?

2570
02:04:50,293 --> 02:04:51,543
Isn't the Heaven of ice and Fire

2571
02:04:51,626 --> 02:04:52,918
all ready?

2572
02:04:55,793 --> 02:04:56,751
It went bad.

2573
02:05:08,543 --> 02:05:11,043
Where does the Hsia you mentioned live?

2574
02:05:11,126 --> 02:05:12,126
In Back-Site.

2575
02:05:12,834 --> 02:05:13,876
In the backside?

2576
02:05:13,959 --> 02:05:15,626
There's no one in the backside.

2577
02:05:15,709 --> 02:05:18,959
Hsia loved my Fried Rice Noodle.

2578
02:05:20,459 --> 02:05:21,876
She never ate the noodles

2579
02:05:21,959 --> 02:05:23,584
I made her though.

2580
02:05:23,668 --> 02:05:25,001
You know who ate them instead?

2581
02:05:25,084 --> 02:05:26,876
She gave them to Hsiung.

2582
02:05:28,043 --> 02:05:29,959
So Hsia's Fried Rice Noodle

2583
02:05:30,043 --> 02:05:31,918
were made by you.

2584
02:05:32,001 --> 02:05:32,709
Ladies and Gentlemen,

2585
02:05:32,793 --> 02:05:33,793
Master Tsai

2586
02:05:33,876 --> 02:05:36,126
will now serve his last course.

2587
02:05:36,918 --> 02:05:38,626
He's not Master Tsai.

2588
02:05:42,418 --> 02:05:44,168
Even I know what that is.

2589
02:05:44,251 --> 02:05:46,001
It's Scrambled Tomato and Eggs.

2590
02:05:51,334 --> 02:05:53,959
Did you make this?

2591
02:05:54,584 --> 02:05:56,126
Yes.

2592
02:05:56,918 --> 02:05:59,751
Many mothers can make it too.

2593
02:06:07,876 --> 02:06:10,876
Maybe you're watching me live on TV.

2594
02:06:14,001 --> 02:06:15,418
Although

2595
02:06:15,501 --> 02:06:18,543
you left me when I was 6,

2596
02:06:22,626 --> 02:06:23,876
the day that you left me

2597
02:06:23,959 --> 02:06:25,876
you made Scrambled Tomato and Eggs

2598
02:06:26,959 --> 02:06:28,793
that I still remember even now.

2599
02:06:34,043 --> 02:06:35,209
Now

2600
02:06:35,293 --> 02:06:37,084
I just want to tell you.

2601
02:06:40,126 --> 02:06:41,668
I don't resent you anymore.

2602
02:06:49,584 --> 02:06:51,918
I'm doing fine.

2603
02:06:52,001 --> 02:06:54,001
Please don't worry.

2604
02:07:00,876 --> 02:07:01,876
Please enjoy.

2605
02:07:08,293 --> 02:07:13,626
Mothers are like the Moon

2606
02:07:13,709 --> 02:07:19,209
Shining through the window

2607
02:07:19,293 --> 02:07:24,668
With dedication and kindness

2608
02:07:24,751 --> 02:07:28,709
Sending out rays of love

2609
02:07:29,626 --> 02:07:31,751
Mama.

2610
02:07:32,959 --> 02:07:34,751
Mama.

2611
02:07:34,834 --> 02:07:37,543
He's standing up on his own!

2612
02:07:37,876 --> 02:07:38,918
Awesome!

2613
02:07:39,251 --> 02:07:40,709
Mama.

2614
02:07:40,793 --> 02:07:41,834
Mama.

2615
02:07:42,793 --> 02:07:44,001
He's standing up on his own.

2616
02:07:44,084 --> 02:07:46,043
Mama.

2617
02:07:53,709 --> 02:07:54,584
Don't judge a book by its cover.

2618
02:07:54,668 --> 02:07:56,251
Don't judge a book by its cover.

2619
02:07:57,418 --> 02:07:59,876
It's now the final course.

2620
02:08:00,751 --> 02:08:01,793
Master Wan

2621
02:08:01,876 --> 02:08:03,209
your name sounds like "small bowl".

2622
02:08:03,293 --> 02:08:05,751
But you're using a big bowl
for the final course.

2623
02:08:05,834 --> 02:08:07,501
What's your final course?

2624
02:08:08,793 --> 02:08:10,376
Leftover Stew.

2625
02:08:11,751 --> 02:08:13,209
Ladies and Gentlemen,

2626
02:08:13,293 --> 02:08:16,543
we can't believe the final showdown

2627
02:08:16,626 --> 02:08:18,043
is Scrambled Tomato and Eggs

2628
02:08:18,126 --> 02:08:20,709
versus Leftover Stew.

2629
02:08:20,793 --> 02:08:23,126
I've never touched this thing before.

2630
02:08:23,834 --> 02:08:25,501
It looks exactly like leftovers.

2631
02:08:36,293 --> 02:08:38,543
Out of all the courses today,

2632
02:08:38,918 --> 02:08:42,168
this is the only one
I want to take home with me.

2633
02:08:42,251 --> 02:08:43,793
I want to heat it up

2634
02:08:43,876 --> 02:08:45,543
and eat it over rice everyday.

2635
02:08:47,043 --> 02:08:48,251
Bravo!

2636
02:08:48,334 --> 02:08:50,001
C'est la vie!

2637
02:08:50,084 --> 02:08:53,209
I didn't think it could taste so good.

2638
02:08:58,209 --> 02:08:59,334
But still...

2639
02:09:00,543 --> 02:09:02,584
I vote for Scrambled Tomato and Eggs.

2640
02:09:03,834 --> 02:09:04,959
It's okay, it's okay.

2641
02:09:07,084 --> 02:09:08,543
My vote goes to Leftover Stew.

2642
02:09:08,626 --> 02:09:11,001
I think Leftover Stew
is what catering's all about.

2643
02:09:13,334 --> 02:09:14,293
The current score

2644
02:09:14,376 --> 02:09:15,793
is 1 to 1 .

2645
02:09:15,876 --> 02:09:17,001
There is one critical vote to go.

2646
02:09:17,084 --> 02:09:18,709
Whoever gets the vote
from the Chow hound

2647
02:09:18,793 --> 02:09:21,168
will be the champion
of this Catering Contest.

2648
02:09:21,251 --> 02:09:23,376
Judge Chow hound, please!

2649
02:09:24,668 --> 02:09:26,459
I vote for Leftover Stew!

2650
02:09:29,959 --> 02:09:31,793
Congratulations, Master Wan!

2651
02:09:34,293 --> 02:09:36,209
You don't even know how to cook.

2652
02:09:37,376 --> 02:09:38,959
You want to take it home with you?

2653
02:09:39,043 --> 02:09:40,584
I'd now like to announce

2654
02:09:40,668 --> 02:09:42,959
that our champion this year

2655
02:09:43,043 --> 02:09:44,709
is our...

2656
02:09:45,543 --> 02:09:47,376
What's wrong, Judge?

2657
02:09:47,459 --> 02:09:48,584
Judge, Judge,

2658
02:09:48,668 --> 02:09:50,126
Judge, are you okay?

2659
02:09:50,584 --> 02:09:52,043
He's choking! Call an ambulance!

2660
02:09:53,668 --> 02:09:54,584
I'll take care of it.

2661
02:09:54,834 --> 02:09:55,834
Call an ambulance.

2662
02:09:55,918 --> 02:09:58,168
What's wrong? Judge!

2663
02:09:58,251 --> 02:09:59,584
I'll take care of it. Move.

2664
02:10:00,293 --> 02:10:02,084
Wan's Mom, what are you doing?

2665
02:10:08,459 --> 02:10:10,418
He spit it out!

2666
02:10:10,918 --> 02:10:12,168
You're welcome.

2667
02:10:13,626 --> 02:10:14,668
Who knew?

2668
02:10:14,751 --> 02:10:15,918
No big deal.

2669
02:10:16,001 --> 02:10:17,126
I'm glad that nothing bad happened.

2670
02:10:17,209 --> 02:10:19,543
We will now announce first place.

2671
02:10:19,626 --> 02:10:21,209
Hold on!

2672
02:10:21,834 --> 02:10:24,001
Judge, what's with you again?

2673
02:10:25,084 --> 02:10:27,043
Everyone,

2674
02:10:27,126 --> 02:10:28,709
Just now,

2675
02:10:28,793 --> 02:10:33,043
I've just had a near-death experience.

2676
02:10:33,126 --> 02:10:34,793
Everything suddenly

2677
02:10:34,876 --> 02:10:36,543
went dark.

2678
02:10:36,626 --> 02:10:38,543
And then

2679
02:10:38,626 --> 02:10:42,584
I saw all the food I've ever had

2680
02:10:42,668 --> 02:10:44,793
each appearing

2681
02:10:44,876 --> 02:10:46,209
in front of me

2682
02:10:46,293 --> 02:10:47,751
one by one.

2683
02:10:48,668 --> 02:10:49,876
And I thought

2684
02:10:49,959 --> 02:10:51,793
if I managed to live

2685
02:10:52,126 --> 02:10:54,001
what food I'd most like to eat.

2686
02:10:54,084 --> 02:10:55,543
And the image I choose was...

2687
02:11:03,376 --> 02:11:05,709
was my favorite dish

2688
02:11:05,793 --> 02:11:08,168
I've had in this life.

2689
02:11:09,584 --> 02:11:11,084
Everyone!

2690
02:11:12,293 --> 02:11:13,709
I'm changing my vote!

2691
02:11:14,959 --> 02:11:19,043
Earlier I voted for

2692
02:11:19,126 --> 02:11:21,084
Fried River Eels.

2693
02:11:21,168 --> 02:11:23,459
Now I'm voting for

2694
02:11:25,376 --> 02:11:27,709
Master Tsai's

2695
02:11:27,793 --> 02:11:29,918
No Complaints, No Regrets.

2696
02:11:32,709 --> 02:11:34,626
Champion! Wonderful!

2697
02:11:34,959 --> 02:11:37,001
Ghost Head! We're the champions!

2698
02:11:37,084 --> 02:11:37,668
Ghost Head!

2699
02:11:38,126 --> 02:11:39,876
It's not fair!

2700
02:11:46,459 --> 02:11:48,709
We're the Champion! Champion!

2701
02:12:04,918 --> 02:12:06,043
Here come the newlyweds.

2702
02:12:06,126 --> 02:12:07,168
Sorry.

2703
02:12:07,251 --> 02:12:09,584
We didn't follow your menu exactly.

2704
02:12:09,668 --> 02:12:10,626
That's all right.

2705
02:12:10,709 --> 02:12:12,834
It tastes a lot like
what we had 50 years ago.

2706
02:12:12,918 --> 02:12:15,584
Really delicious. Thank you.

2707
02:12:15,959 --> 02:12:17,043
It's nothing.

2708
02:12:17,126 --> 02:12:18,793
I'm the one who should thank you.

2709
02:12:18,876 --> 02:12:20,043
I wish you two...

2710
02:12:20,126 --> 02:12:21,876
happiness in your marriage.

2711
02:12:23,626 --> 02:12:25,959
Congratulations.

2712
02:12:28,168 --> 02:12:29,334
Hsia,

2713
02:12:29,418 --> 02:12:30,959
are you happy today?

2714
02:12:31,043 --> 02:12:32,543
I'm very happy.

2715
02:12:32,626 --> 02:12:34,251
A lot of people came.

2716
02:12:34,334 --> 02:12:36,918
And enjoyed the same flavors
as 50 years ago.

2717
02:12:41,959 --> 02:12:43,251
In addition

2718
02:12:43,334 --> 02:12:46,584
to the 1 million prize money,

2719
02:12:46,668 --> 02:12:48,043
the champion will cater

2720
02:12:48,126 --> 02:12:50,084
a State Dinner.

2721
02:12:51,084 --> 02:12:53,751
In addition to the
300 thousand prize money,

2722
02:12:53,834 --> 02:12:55,418
2nd place gets a contract
from the government

2723
02:12:55,501 --> 02:12:57,918
to design lunch boxes for the rail road.

2724
02:12:58,001 --> 02:13:00,626
We have to make lunch boxes
for the prize.

2725
02:13:01,334 --> 02:13:04,168
First, I'd like to thank our organizer.

2726
02:13:04,251 --> 02:13:05,626
I'm Liao Yi Tsai.

2727
02:13:05,709 --> 02:13:07,084
People call me Master Tsai.

2728
02:13:07,668 --> 02:13:08,668
Everyday, I put my heart into making food

2729
02:13:08,751 --> 02:13:11,043
whose taste and flavor

2730
02:13:11,251 --> 02:13:13,084
are wonderful beyond words.

2731
02:13:13,168 --> 02:13:14,668
Therefore,
winning the championship today

2732
02:13:14,751 --> 02:13:16,293
is a confirmation of your choice.

2733
02:13:16,376 --> 02:13:17,584
Excellent!

2734
02:13:18,584 --> 02:13:19,543
Yes, Master Wan,

2735
02:13:19,626 --> 02:13:21,376
any words to share about the award?

2736
02:13:25,668 --> 02:13:26,918
Thanks.

2737
02:13:30,209 --> 02:13:31,043
Brief but powerful.

2738
02:13:31,126 --> 02:13:31,918
Yes.

2739
02:13:32,001 --> 02:13:34,793
What a perfect ending

2740
02:13:34,876 --> 02:13:36,876
to the First National Catering Contest!

2741
02:13:37,834 --> 02:13:38,543
(Wan's Lunch Box Eatery)

2742
02:13:38,626 --> 02:13:39,418
Our team was bitter

2743
02:13:39,501 --> 02:13:41,251
about not winning.

2744
02:13:41,793 --> 02:13:42,834
But

2745
02:13:42,918 --> 02:13:44,751
I knew that we crammed up to the end.

2746
02:13:45,293 --> 02:13:46,251
We wouldn't have even made it
to the Contest

2747
02:13:46,334 --> 02:13:47,876
without so much help from everyone.

2748
02:13:50,793 --> 02:13:53,251
Now Mom and I
are in the lunch box business.

2749
02:13:56,584 --> 02:13:57,668
Stooges A and B

2750
02:13:57,751 --> 02:14:00,626
stayed to run the business with us.

2751
02:14:00,709 --> 02:14:02,751
The Animals on Call went back to school.

2752
02:14:02,834 --> 02:14:05,543
But we chat online everyday.

2753
02:14:06,209 --> 02:14:08,126
Sometimes they talk about

2754
02:14:08,209 --> 02:14:10,168
entering the contest again next year.

2755
02:14:11,084 --> 02:14:12,793
But I have no interest in doing it.

2756
02:14:12,876 --> 02:14:15,668
I'm happy with the lunch box business.

2757
02:14:15,751 --> 02:14:17,168
At least,

2758
02:14:17,251 --> 02:14:20,126
I get to make myself look pretty everyday.

2759
02:14:20,751 --> 02:14:23,168
Oh, about the 9 million debt,

2760
02:14:23,751 --> 02:14:25,834
it turned out to be a scam.

2761
02:14:28,084 --> 02:14:29,834
Um,

2762
02:14:29,918 --> 02:14:32,001
can I pay you 300 thousand for now?

2763
02:14:34,251 --> 02:14:35,209
That money,

2764
02:14:35,293 --> 02:14:37,084
you don't need to pay us back.

2765
02:14:37,168 --> 02:14:37,834
What?

2766
02:14:37,918 --> 02:14:38,626
Huh?

2767
02:14:38,709 --> 02:14:39,959
The thing is...

2768
02:14:40,043 --> 02:14:41,334
You tell her. You tell her!

2769
02:14:44,959 --> 02:14:46,459
Here's what happened.

2770
02:14:47,459 --> 02:14:49,376
Who's going to get my money back?

2771
02:14:51,459 --> 02:14:53,209
Ah long, you two play
"rock paper scissors"

2772
02:14:53,293 --> 02:14:54,501
to decide.

2773
02:14:57,626 --> 02:14:59,126
Go and get the guy

2774
02:14:59,209 --> 02:15:00,793
to pay me back 9 million.

2775
02:15:05,959 --> 02:15:07,543
Up ahead!

2776
02:15:32,459 --> 02:15:33,918
(IOU - loaned paper)

2777
02:15:48,751 --> 02:15:50,084
Surprise!

2778
02:15:51,584 --> 02:15:52,626
No need to pay it back.

2779
02:15:52,709 --> 02:15:53,334
Here,

2780
02:15:53,418 --> 02:15:54,418
this is the IOU.

2781
02:15:54,501 --> 02:15:55,584
Here.

2782
02:15:59,459 --> 02:16:02,084
Hope you'll never have to pay it back.

2783
02:16:02,168 --> 02:16:03,334
Yeah, yeah.

2784
02:16:03,418 --> 02:16:04,876
You guys are great.

2785
02:16:04,959 --> 02:16:06,418
You had me fooled.

2786
02:16:16,918 --> 02:16:18,251
(The Loving Ya)

2787
02:16:36,251 --> 02:16:36,751
We're out of garlic.

2788
02:16:36,834 --> 02:16:38,209
I'll go buy some.

2789
02:16:38,293 --> 02:16:39,334
Okay.

2790
02:16:43,293 --> 02:16:44,293
How are you?

2791
02:16:45,918 --> 02:16:49,209
An uncle asked me to give you this.

2792
02:16:49,668 --> 02:16:50,584
Huh?

2793
02:17:20,793 --> 02:17:21,793
Hello.

2794
02:17:22,709 --> 02:17:23,834
Hello.

2795
02:17:24,793 --> 02:17:25,918
You have an empty box near you?

2796
02:17:26,001 --> 02:17:27,084
You have an empty box near you?

2797
02:17:29,584 --> 02:17:31,043
Sure.

2798
02:17:31,126 --> 02:17:32,709
Put it on.

2799
02:17:34,001 --> 02:17:35,376
What for?

2800
02:17:35,459 --> 02:17:36,834
Put it on.

2801
02:17:51,918 --> 02:17:53,126
Where are you?

2802
02:17:55,751 --> 02:17:57,376
On a beach.

2803
02:17:58,876 --> 02:18:00,418
How's the weather there?

2804
02:18:01,793 --> 02:18:03,793
Very good.

2805
02:18:03,876 --> 02:18:05,709
There's a pool sea breeze.

2806
02:18:08,043 --> 02:18:09,959
Where are you?

2807
02:18:10,376 --> 02:18:12,168
I'm on a beach too.

2808
02:18:12,876 --> 02:18:14,918
You're on a beach, too?

2809
02:18:16,043 --> 02:18:17,751
I'm sitting next to you.

2810
02:19:12,459 --> 02:19:14,376
Love is so sweet.

2811
02:19:14,459 --> 02:19:16,459
Even bitter melon isn't so bitter.

2812
02:19:25,959 --> 02:19:27,459
Master! Master!

2813
02:19:27,543 --> 02:19:30,126
I had a weird dream last night.

2814
02:19:30,209 --> 02:19:32,334
In the dream, I had grown very old

2815
02:19:32,418 --> 02:19:34,584
and entered a catering contest.

2816
02:19:35,709 --> 02:19:37,043
Did you win or lose?

2817
02:19:37,126 --> 02:19:38,209
I wasn't in the contest!

2818
02:19:38,293 --> 02:19:39,793
It was my apprentice's daughter.

2819
02:19:39,876 --> 02:19:41,084
Huh!

2820
02:19:41,168 --> 02:19:42,918
You have an apprentice?

2821
02:19:43,001 --> 02:19:44,459
A woman caterer. Did she win?

2822
02:19:44,543 --> 02:19:46,043
She lost.

2823
02:19:46,126 --> 02:19:47,168
You're Master Loser.

2824
02:19:47,251 --> 02:19:48,334
I'm not Master Loser.

2825
02:19:48,418 --> 02:19:49,626
I'm Master Tiger Nose.

2826
02:19:49,709 --> 02:19:51,918
More like Master Runny Nose to me!

2827
02:19:53,668 --> 02:19:55,334
Master!

2828
02:19:55,418 --> 02:19:57,209
Can I hold the meat for a while?

2829
02:20:01,126 --> 02:20:02,459
Don't drop it.

2830
02:20:06,251 --> 02:20:07,043
Oops!

2831
02:20:08,209 --> 02:20:10,293
Damn, you idiot ! I'll kick your ass!

2832
02:20:10,318 --> 02:20:15,318
