1
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,611
Okay, let's go for a take

2
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,845
Get ready to carry her forward

3
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,977
Okay? Is sound ready?

4
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:58,675
Ready

5
00:01:58,785 --> 00:01:59,376
Camera ready?

6
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,278
All set, director

7
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,647
Then let's go for it

8
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,247
Scene 3, Shot 1, Take 2

9
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:05,751
Action!

10
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:07,750
Excuse me...

11
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:08,657
Sorry!

12
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:09,523
I'm so sorry to be late, director

13
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,119
Cut!

14
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,161
I'll be ready in a moment, sorry

15
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:13,195
Producer, deal with this

16
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,926
Hey, untangle the wires for me! Sorry...

17
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,023
Xiao Tang...

18
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,603
Sorry I'm late, Miss Lieh

19
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:19,467
I'm really sorry, I'll be ready in a moment

20
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:20,402
Sorry!

21
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:21,872
What's wrong with you?

22
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:25,039
You're not our sound recordist any more

23
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:28,709
Didn't I tell you last time?

24
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,443
Kun's doing the job now
Did you forget?

25
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,880
Sorry... I forgot

26
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:39,790
Excuse me...

27
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,226
Excuse me

28
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,466
Director, I'm really sorry

29
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,398
Excuse me

30
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,829
Miss Lieh, I'm sorry

31
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,271
You really have to pull yourself together

32
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,103
Wait...

33
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,296
Don't worry, I'm not a cop

34
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,478
The money we agreed on...

35
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,852
And here's another 3,000

36
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,123
Let's have some fun

37
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,790
Let's be clear, I don't do kinky

38
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,764
Relax, it's just a little game

39
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,472
Don't be scared

40
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,343
What's your name?

41
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,542
Meng-Meng

42
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,050
Meng-Meng

43
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,514
You seem to be afraid of cops

44
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,955
I'm not afraid, they just annoy me

45
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,626
Annoy you?

46
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,461
That's good

47
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,625
That's very good

48
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,835
Ever heard of role-playing therapy?

49
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,740
What kind of play is that?

50
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,007
Never mind

51
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:59,842
Now you're a cop... and I'm you

52
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,547
What?

53
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,417
Now we're going to try some role-playing

54
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,255
You play a cop and I play you

55
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,886
What the hell? Are you a masochist?

56
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,430
Has any cop treated you badly?

57
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,466
No, no, but you must have been!

58
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:15,591
Then what are you afraid of?

59
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:19,364
I'm not afraid, I just...

60
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,537
...I just don't do that stuff

61
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,544
It's simple

62
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,307
Just play the part of some bad cop

63
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:32,441
you've met

64
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,285
I don't know how

65
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,917
It's very easy, actually

66
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,360
Watch me...

67
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,463
Now...

68
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,704
...I'm you

69
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,419
Fuck off... I'm not that stupid

70
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,455
Don't do that, Mr Cop

71
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:21,565
Oh! What's that hard thing?

72
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,894
What hard thing?

73
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:24,662
What?

74
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,101
This one!

75
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,729
You fucking cunt!

76
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,102
I'll arrest you if you keep talking shit

77
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,571
I'm so scared, Mr Cop

78
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,372
Don't scare me like that

79
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,706
I'm just a delicate girl

80
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,973
Not tough like you men

81
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,980
One look at us and you get a hard-on...
And then you want it

82
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,451
And when you finish, we have to pay you!

83
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:42,816
You're sick!

84
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:47,219
Well, blowhard, you got that right

85
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,191
Fucking smartass, are you?

86
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:50,923
Get down on your belly!

87
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,094
On your belly!

88
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,065
Don't you know...

89
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,193
...a cop is a gangster with a badge!

90
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,735
Get the idea now?

91
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:01,965
Now give Mr Cop a good fuck!

92
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,234
Oh, Mr Cop!

93
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:04,172
Lift up your ass!

94
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,835
You're so bad, Mr Gangster Cop

95
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,742
Sluts are there to be fucked, aren't they?

96
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,212
Mr Cop!

97
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,477
You want to fuck me?

98
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,851
Then I want to rape you!

99
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,784
That hurts!

100
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,379
Hello?

101
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,722
Sorry, I can't come today

102
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,765
It's okay, your work comes first

103
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,461
Have you finished moving in?

104
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,830
Need any help?

105
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,302
It's done

106
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,307
That was quick! Then...

107
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,042
...how about a kiss?

108
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,149
No

109
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,691
I have to get something

110
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,251
Your work comes first

111
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,895
Then... bye-bye

112
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,927
Didn't you say you were busy?

113
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:11,752
I'm here, amn't I?

114
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,958
The first three years with my husband...

115
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,291
...we made love almost every day

116
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,458
In different places

117
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,499
At different times

118
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,463
As soon as met...

119
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,470
...we couldn't tear ourselves apart

120
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,637
Wherever we found ourselves...

121
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,905
...we had to do it right away

122
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,675
Just like animals in heat

123
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,579
But I was never ashamed

124
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,348
I just thought...

125
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,321
...no other couple in the world...

126
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:15,188
...could match what we had

127
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,226
Just as no-one

128
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,593
could match us

129
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,196
Each time we saw each other...

130
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,761
...every cell in our bodies tingled...

131
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:32,072
...longing for each other's cells

132
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,140
As if they were crying out...

133
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,771
...mouths wide open...

134
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:40,374
"I want, I want, I want"

135
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,656
That's very good

136
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,328
So what's the problem?

137
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,070
Now it's different, isn't it?

138
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,533
You can't imagine your husband...

139
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:08,044
...making love to another woman

140
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,719
Learning that he's having an affair...

141
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,221
...has totally destroyed you

142
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,727
How did you know?

143
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:30,057
The love that thrilled you fell apart

144
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:34,163
Your trust in the man you trusted most
fell apart

145
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:37,202
It started a chain reaction

146
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,140
Your belief system fell apart

147
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,007
Your philosophy fell apart

148
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,478
The meaning of life fell apart

149
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:43,513
Your very self fell apart...

150
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,140
...into pieces

151
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,775
You panic

152
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,611
But no matter how hard you try...

153
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:52,179
...you can't put the pieces back together

154
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,119
Every day you ask yourself...

155
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,887
"What's going on? What's going on?"

156
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,327
"How can this be happening?
How can this be happening?"

157
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,091
Every day you recall every last detail

158
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,326
of your lovemaking

159
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:03,958
Every position

160
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,866
Every one of his caresses

161
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:08,963
Every angle he twisted your body

162
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,634
Every one of your cries of ecstasy

163
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:18,639
All your orgasmic pleas to stop

164
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,852
And then the painful thoughts kick in

165
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,947
How can he do the same things

166
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,322
with another woman?

167
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:35,856
You imagine your husband going to her

168
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,902
And right after she opens the door...

169
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,698
...how he pulls up her skirt

170
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:42,171
pulls down her panties...

171
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,242
...tells her to lift up her ass

172
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,335
All the things he liked to do to you

173
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:51,450
You imagine them fucking in the open,
in tall grass

174
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,179
On the staircase of some building

175
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,082
In your husband's car...

176
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:56,513
...randomly parked

177
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,317
somewhere in Taipei

178
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,823
Or maybe your husband's driving...

179
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:02,257
...and she's going up and down
on his crotch

180
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,124
You imagine her groaning, panting, begging

181
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,253
You imagine him saying to her...

182
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,296
"I love fucking you"

183
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,956
"I want to fuck you to death"

184
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,701
All of those words which you thought...

185
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,040
...he could only say to you

186
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,142
It's just as if the two of them...

187
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:25,716
...are giving their selves to each other

188
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,945
Falling asleep in each other's arms

189
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:29,479
All of this

190
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:33,820
keeps playing in your mind

191
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,019
It's freaking you out

192
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:45,426
You're almost going insane

193
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,539
Day after day

194
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,138
after day

195
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:51,903
after day

196
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,574
Every day you cry so hard you can't sleep

197
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,379
And in the morning you wake up
in complete shock

198
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,351
You sit up from a sleeping position...

199
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,021
Your mouth is dry...
You're desperately searching...

200
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,491
But you don't know what you're looking for

201
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,224
Still, you understand very clearly...

202
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,797
...that you're gone

203
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,296
You no longer exist

204
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:26,174
You don't have the slightest sense
of being alive

205
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,940
You panic... panic...

206
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,172
Panic

207
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,855
Without knowing it, you're in tears

208
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,160
You can't stop crying

209
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,496
You just

210
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:53,166
can't stop

211
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:02,308
What should I do?

212
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:09,886
"Gensheng Road, Taidong City"

213
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:34,345
Is this for the previous tenant?

214
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,682
Miss Tseng?

215
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:44,022
She lives in 402

216
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,056
No, I've just moved in there

217
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,893
She was there before me

218
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,333
Number 538, Apartment 402

219
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:53,836
Let me check

220
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:00,101
Oh, you're Miss Wu... Wu Ruoyun

221
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,703
She's already moved out

222
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,541
But she keeps getting letters

223
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,481
Can I leave them here with you?

224
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:10,111
Then she can pick them up when she
comes back

225
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,519
I can't do anything about that

226
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,293
Well then...

227
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,420
Sorry

228
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,792
Never mind

229
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,728
Sorry, sorry...

230
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:19,485
"Miss Tseng Yazhu"

231
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:38,254
This is the fourth one already

232
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:43,465
There's no sender's address

233
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,965
The stamps caught my eye

234
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,403
They're all mailed from the East coast

235
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:51,007
All from different places

236
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,124
Hello?

237
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,424
In a meeting

238
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:21,004
It wasn't planned...
A foreign clientjust flew in

239
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,010
I'm can't do dinner

240
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:29,876
How about a drink?

241
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:35,918
How about a drink and a movie?

242
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,254
There are people here

243
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:46,830
I love you

244
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,193
I love you

245
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,697
I love you

246
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,468
I don't know yet

247
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:08,944
I'll be through here soon, okay?

248
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,416
It's a foreign client

249
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:21,461
I'll finish here soon, okay?

250
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:26,600
Fine, let's talk when I'm back

251
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:39,607
Here's another brand

252
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,310
See if this is what you want

253
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:51,562
This ones

254
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,460
It plays cassette tapes?

255
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,999
Yes, yes, if it's a tape, it will play it

256
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,797
But I don't recommend it

257
00:28:58,903 --> 00:28:59,665
Seriously

258
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:00,829
Everyone uses MP3 now

259
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,930
This kind of thing is obsolete

260
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,288
Ruoyun...

261
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:26,789
Aren't you an Aquarius?

262
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:29,366
I found this site on the web

263
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:32,527
It says if I'm a Cancer...

264
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:34,798
...and you're an Aquarius...

265
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:35,838
...then the two of us...

266
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,463
...are a perfect match!

267
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:37,871
It couldn't be better!

268
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,138
100%!

269
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:42,896
Yazhu...

270
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:47,377
Do you remember this place?

271
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:51,375
We once sat here together...

272
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:53,542
...recording the sound of the sea

273
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,385
I remember you said that...

274
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:02,693
...you liked that I looked so serious
while I was working

275
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,623
You liked to stand beside me,
holding your breath...

276
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:11,394
...imagining all the awesome sounds...

277
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:14,027
...I was capturing with my boom mike

278
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:20,610
You liked my sensitivity to sound
and my dedication

279
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,712
It was right here...

280
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,682
...that we made the wish together

281
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,382
To travel around the country...

282
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,720
...recording sounds from every corner
of Taiwan

283
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:39,654
And it was you who came up with the title
for all these sounds

284
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,698
It was...

285
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,000
"The Sounds of Formosa"

286
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:46,824

00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:48,193

00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:47,209
"...there's never enough time"

344
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:51,379
"La la la"

345
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,582
"Hotline you and me"

346
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:56,686
"La la la"

347
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:59,388
"Hotline you and me"

348
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,758
"La la la"

349
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,660
"Hotline you and me"

350
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:07,464
"La la la"

351
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,766
"Hotline you and me"

352
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:13,108
Who the hell are you?

353
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,576
I'm a betelnut

354
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:27,647
Morning!

355
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,616
Going out?

356
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:33,322
That long, furry thing you're carrying...

357
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:34,823
What is it?

358
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,552
It's for recording sound

359
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:38,224
Do you know...

360
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,354
...any special sounds around here?

361
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:42,398
Special sounds?

362
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,334
Anything striking

363
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:47,802
I want to record them

364
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,472
Special sounds...

365
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:53,401
I know...

366
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:57,379
Take the road behind the hotel

367
00:41:57,481 --> 00:42:00,279
After a kilometer or so...

368
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:01,749
...you come to a wood

369
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:04,187
There's some interesting sounds there

370
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,246
What kind of sounds?

371
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,346
You might not find them interesting

372
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:08,186
It depends

373
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:09,623
I think they are

374
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,217
That's okay, go on

375
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,888
There's lots of squirrels there

376
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:16,591
In the afternoon...

377
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,568
...you can hear them courting

378
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,331
"Gagaga!"

379
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:23,406
Very noisy, but funny to hear!

380
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:24,337
Really

381
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:25,408
Go take a look

382
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:26,567
Okay

383
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:22,689
Should I go to the Karaoke with him tonight?

384
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,298
With who?

385
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:27,063
The guy I was just talking about!

386
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:29,004
The funny guy who sang with me yesterday

387
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:33,809
Will you come too?

388
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:34,536
Sure

389
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:37,079
We can all go together

390
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,912
Good

391
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:42,011
We can scam him for some cash

392
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:46,622
Are you sure? He's a tourist

393
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:47,620
Why not?

394
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:51,058
Tourists are asking to be scammed!

395
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:52,089
Anyhow...

396
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:54,824
Forget about going to Karaoke

397
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,858
Go straight to his room

398
00:43:58,068 --> 00:43:59,797
We'll need a signal

399
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,899
Something to tell us when to burst in

400
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,173
...a signal

401
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:10,736
Go straight to his room

402
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:17,752
Forget about going to Karaoke

403
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:20,650
Go straight to his room

404
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:22,953
Just meet up with him in his room?

405
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,531
Ma'am...

406
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:33,762
Young man

407
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:34,530
Excuse me...

408
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:36,128
Did you get that sound?

409
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,368
Which sound?

410
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:39,701
The sound of the squirrels courting

411
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,004
Oh...

412
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:44,046
Yes, I did

413
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:44,978
Great!

414
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:45,878
Thanks

415
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:47,541
Ma'am, I'm looking for the guest in Room 252

416
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:49,414
One moment, let me see...

417
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:51,945
He's still out

418
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:53,012
Really?

419
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:54,112
Thank you

420
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:55,748
You're welcome

421
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:01,420
Hello...

422
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,931
He's not here

423
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,239
I'll play you that "Gagaga" sound
right away

424
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,714
Good

425
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,587
Wait a minute...

426
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:02,625
Hey...

427
00:46:02,726 --> 00:46:05,422
Have you heard the sound of squirrels courting?

428
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:07,424
What's it like?

429
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:08,792
Listen carefully...

430
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:10,264
"Gagaga"

431
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:12,425
"Gagaga"

432
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:15,096
That's right! You learn fast...

433
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,108
No...

434
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:25,715
Now you're a squirrel

435
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:29,115
To get me undressed, you have to
woo me loudly!

436
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:34,514
Wow!

437
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,788
Of all the people I've met...

438
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:41,294
...you're the most talented

439
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:43,889
Make it loud!

440
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:46,726
"Gagaga"

441
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,828
Louder

442
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,070
"Gagaga!"

443
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:54,340
Still louder

444
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:01,479
"Gagaga!"

445
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:03,848
What the fuck are you two doing?

446
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:05,353
You are so screwed!

447
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,218
You cheat on me?

448
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,315
I should use you like a whore!

449
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:12,288
Having fun with my wife?

450
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:16,322
You're in big fucking trouble!

451
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:17,091
Who are you?

452
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:19,066
I'm your fucking father!

453
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,898
Ladies and gentlemen...

454
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,470
I know what you're up to

455
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:28,101
But don't go on with this

456
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:33,146
How much should we take him for?

457
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:34,811
Half a million

458
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:37,512
Too little... a million

459
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:39,149
I think one and a half million

460
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:41,019
Half a million each

461
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:42,149
Ah Bin...

462
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:43,886
When we burst in...

463
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:44,983
...you take the pictures

464
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:45,618
Okay?

465
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:47,196
Yeah

466
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:48,229
Got a camera?

467
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:50,232
My cellphone will do

468
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:52,394
How is this possible?

469
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:54,597
What's going on?

470
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,735
Hurry, grab the stuff, run!

471
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:03,904
Quick!

472
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:19,389
Hey!

473
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:22,862
Are you alright?

474
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,433
Hey!

475
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:30,835
What are you doing?

476
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:32,465
I saved your ass!

477
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:30,687
What do you do for a living?

478
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:33,686
You don't have to get back to work?

479
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:38,166
If I tell you, you won't believe me

480
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,701
I...

481
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,609
...deal drugs

482
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,273
Never...

483
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:57,554
The drugs I deal, you can't see

484
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:00,250
They anesthetize people's minds

485
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:05,117
Sounds complicated

486
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:11,058
What the hell does that mean?

487
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:27,674
You are seriously weird

488
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:55,174
Whatever sound you want...

489
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,242
...I can make it for you

490
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:25,671
"La la la"

491
00:52:25,775 --> 00:52:27,800
"Hotline you and me"

492
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:29,835
"Of all the people I've met..."

493
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:31,880
"...you're the most talented"

494
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:37,045
"Hey!"

495
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,678
"I came to save your ass!"

496
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:08,468
Xiao Tang!

497
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,067
We'll launch

498
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:11,306
a big media campaign

499
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:13,579
In magazines...

500
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:15,173
...newspapers, on buses, on the internet...

501
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:17,253
All at the same time!

502
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:20,816
I must also thank you...

503
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,883
...for the successful press conference

504
00:54:26,863 --> 00:54:28,626
The clients are very satisfied

505
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:30,791
You're our man for the next press release

506
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,395
I'll treat you to dinner sometime

507
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:36,233
French, Indian... whatever you like

508
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:37,806
Anything you want

509
00:54:57,894 --> 00:55:01,125
Of course, there's plenty of time...

510
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:09,431
Don't think that sending her those tapes...

511
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,591
...will make her come back to you

512
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:15,131
Just regard this trip...

513
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:17,763
...as a ceremony of self-redemption

514
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,301
Don't expect too much

515
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:28,677
Don't think you know everything
just because you're a shrink

516
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:15,764
You have a cellphone?

517
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:17,628
Can I borrow it?

518
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:47,260
Hello?

519
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:49,326
Hello

520
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:52,196
It's me

521
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:55,170
Ah Tsai?

522
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,065
Where are you?

523
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:03,008
I'm in...

524
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,803
...Taidong

525
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:08,617
What the hell are you doing there?

526
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:15,289
That's typical,

527
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:17,791
you're so irresponsible

528
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:18,485
You take off without a word

529
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:21,257
Many people are worrying about you!
You know that?

530
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:24,556
You just think about yourself

531
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,794
So self-centered!

532
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:40,471
Who is it?

533
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:43,115
It's me

534
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:47,750
Can I come in?

535
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:49,253
It's very late

536
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:54,894
I'd like to sleep here tonight

537
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:56,395
Is that okay?

538
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,595
No, not really

539
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:19,621
I saw him

540
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:23,720
Your boyfriend?

541
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:29,724
We're not even divorced yet

542
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:31,197
Ah Tsai...

543
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:52,947
Do you think the Milky Way has a sound?

544
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:02,728
I've never heard that idea before

545
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,625
That's because you've never listened

546
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:10,129
Really?
