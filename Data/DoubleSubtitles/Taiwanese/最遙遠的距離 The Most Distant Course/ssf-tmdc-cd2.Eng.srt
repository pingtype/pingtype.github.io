1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,911
No, it doesn't

2
00:00:06,522 --> 00:00:08,547
There's no sound there

3
00:00:14,897 --> 00:00:17,457
You have to be in tune with it

4
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:20,532
You know?

5
00:00:22,205 --> 00:00:23,866
Silly...

6
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,933
October 14th, 2006

7
00:03:57,035 --> 00:03:59,663
Changbing... The sound of a windbreak forest

8
00:04:10,148 --> 00:04:13,606
October 24th, 2006

9
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:17,077
Changbing... The sound of a windbreak forest

10
00:04:17,288 --> 00:04:19,188
I've found it

11
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,334
October 16th, 2006

12
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:37,340
Chenggong... The sound of a fish auction

13
00:05:20,485 --> 00:05:22,817
October 26th, 2006

14
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,286
Chenggong... Site of the fish auction

15
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:29,182
I've found it

16
00:07:23,307 --> 00:07:24,331
Madam

17
00:07:24,442 --> 00:07:25,272
Hey

18
00:07:25,376 --> 00:07:27,435
Sorry to bother you

19
00:07:27,578 --> 00:07:29,341
Please listen to this sound

20
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:31,012
Listen to what?

21
00:07:31,315 --> 00:07:32,942
It's a tape

22
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,848
Have a listen to see
if you know where it is

23
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:38,649
They're aboriginal people

24
00:07:38,756 --> 00:07:41,816
They sound like old folk and children

25
00:07:46,197 --> 00:07:47,528
There are so many windbreak forests

26
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:50,066
They sound all the same

27
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,965
But I have been to Changbing

28
00:07:55,072 --> 00:07:56,835
I think it's the same sound

29
00:07:56,941 --> 00:07:59,637
Miss
Why are you listening to that?

30
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:01,302
For no reason really

31
00:08:01,412 --> 00:08:02,777
I just want to go to...

32
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,007
...the place where that sound comes from
To feel it

33
00:08:05,116 --> 00:08:07,778
Miss, why do you want to feel it?

34
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:10,816
Just to feel it

35
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:14,784
What's the point of that?

36
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:18,823
It's too vague

37
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,128
It's impossible to find a place just its sound

38
00:09:03,641 --> 00:09:04,938
Madam

39
00:09:05,977 --> 00:09:06,841
This envelope...

40
00:09:06,944 --> 00:09:08,844
Is it yours?

41
00:09:10,014 --> 00:09:12,141
Yes, it's ours

42
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,280
Then do you remember...

43
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:15,978
...a sound recordist staying here before?

44
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:17,884
A sound recordist?

45
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:20,121
Was he holding something very big...

46
00:09:20,224 --> 00:09:21,486
...like a big microphone.

47
00:09:21,592 --> 00:09:23,150
Very furry at the front

48
00:09:23,261 --> 00:09:24,228
I guess so

49
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:25,886
He said he came to record the...

50
00:09:25,997 --> 00:09:27,624
...the sounds of Taiwan

51
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:31,027
What kind of person was he?

52
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,397
He was very nice.

53
00:09:32,503 --> 00:09:35,768
Pleasent talking, nice attitude

54
00:09:37,675 --> 00:09:39,165
What did he look like?

55
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:41,040
Look like...

56
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:44,376
He was gentle looking, thin...

57
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:47,747
...very handsome, easy going

58
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,482
Are you his...

59
00:09:50,588 --> 00:09:52,556
Why are you asking so many questions?

60
00:09:52,957 --> 00:09:54,356
We are friends

61
00:09:54,725 --> 00:09:55,885
Really?

62
00:09:55,993 --> 00:09:57,517
If you are his friend...

63
00:09:57,628 --> 00:09:59,994
...how come you don't know what he looks like?

64
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:05,095
Well...

65
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:08,995
Excuse me

66
00:12:10,928 --> 00:12:14,694
I'd been with Yazhu for five years

67
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,365
From the time I graduated...

68
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:20,193
...right through my military service...

69
00:12:20,805 --> 00:12:23,103
...until I became a sound recordist

70
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,474
I thought we were meant for each other

71
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,607
When I was with her...

72
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:38,085
...I felt peaceful and happy

73
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,054
I thought she felt the same way

74
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:45,755
Maybe she did, once

75
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:50,859
I really loved her very much

76
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:54,796
And I really needed her too

77
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,733
There were many things that I understood...

78
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:03,342
...only after we broke up

79
00:13:07,618 --> 00:13:09,745
Actually she broke up with me

80
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:14,982
That night,

81
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:16,816
as usual...

82
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,191
...I called her before going to sleep

83
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:23,467
We both had jobs by then

84
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:24,934
So we didn't meet so often

85
00:13:27,037 --> 00:13:28,971
We were chatting away...

86
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:31,238
...when she suddenly said...

87
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:34,634
"Don't you think

88
00:13:34,712 --> 00:13:37,237
we both need a change?"

89
00:13:38,582 --> 00:13:41,107
I thought she was kidding

90
00:13:41,218 --> 00:13:43,948
So I tried to laugh it off

91
00:13:46,457 --> 00:13:48,789
But she went on...

92
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:53,526
"I want to break up with you"

93
00:13:53,998 --> 00:13:56,432
"I'm serious"

94
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,671
Yazhu really wanted to stop seeing me

95
00:14:04,074 --> 00:14:06,372
She wasn'tjoking

96
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,455
I'd always thought our world was stable

97
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:23,021
With her...

98
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:28,592
...I could take

99
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,066
all the pressures

100
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:32,766
Difficulties...

101
00:14:33,804 --> 00:14:35,601
Setbacks...

102
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:38,068
Depressions

103
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:41,170
Even pains

104
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,143
Because I knew...

105
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:47,707
...with her understanding...

106
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,217
...just her being there...

107
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,450
...she'd support me

108
00:14:58,863 --> 00:15:00,797
She'd believe in me

109
00:15:00,898 --> 00:15:02,490
She'd give me strength

110
00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:07,195
And that would be enough

111
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,540
Since the break-up,

112
00:15:17,214 --> 00:15:20,547
my life has been a mess

113
00:15:27,024 --> 00:15:28,355
Why can't I remember

114
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:30,825
all the details?

115
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:37,692
I'm thinking of the months before...

116
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:42,771
...I couldn't accept...

117
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,699
...that we'd seen

118
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,903
our last movie together

119
00:15:51,815 --> 00:15:54,340
That we'd slept in each other's arms...

120
00:15:54,718 --> 00:15:56,913
...for the last time

121
00:15:59,823 --> 00:16:00,790
That we'd had a meal together...

122
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:02,791
...for the last time

123
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,605
There were so many things we hadn't
yet done together

124
00:16:19,944 --> 00:16:22,708
We hadn't been abroad together

125
00:16:25,015 --> 00:16:27,643
We hadn't seen snow together

126
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:33,083
We hadn't made

127
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,624
"Sounds of Formosa" together

128
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,403
Now you are Yazhu

129
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,707
I am you

130
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:09,621
I expected...

131
00:17:11,628 --> 00:17:13,459
...to feel sad...

132
00:17:15,632 --> 00:17:17,691
...after the break-up

133
00:17:18,902 --> 00:17:20,893
I'd be heart-broken

134
00:17:22,973 --> 00:17:24,941
But I thought...

135
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:28,678
...after the pain...

136
00:17:30,014 --> 00:17:32,949
...life would go on

137
00:17:35,252 --> 00:17:40,451
My life would still move forward

138
00:17:47,398 --> 00:17:50,162
I've realized only slowly...

139
00:17:52,236 --> 00:17:55,103
...that since you left me...

140
00:17:58,308 --> 00:18:00,640
...I don't know how to go on living...

141
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,805
...without you

142
00:18:18,962 --> 00:18:21,089
You have to be strong

143
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,165
You know?

144
00:18:25,469 --> 00:18:26,993
Silly...

145
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,208
I'm also on my own

146
00:18:33,677 --> 00:18:36,271
I have to take care of myself too

147
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,975
If you truly love me...

148
00:18:44,254 --> 00:18:47,052
...you have to remember what I told you

149
00:18:49,126 --> 00:18:51,026
Be good

150
00:18:52,763 --> 00:18:54,924
Don't make me worry

151
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:58,924
Don't make me sad

152
00:19:00,304 --> 00:19:02,033
You got that?

153
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,753
I will

154
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,087
I'll be good

155
00:20:32,696 --> 00:20:34,323
I'll be good

156
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:09,530
"Girl, your boyfriends..."

157
00:21:09,633 --> 00:21:13,069
"...are all leading lights"

158
00:21:14,204 --> 00:21:17,105
"Ugly guys like us..."

159
00:21:17,207 --> 00:21:20,938
"...don't deserve your love"

160
00:21:21,745 --> 00:21:25,545
"There's no place for me in your dreams"

161
00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:29,608
"It drives me to drink every day!"

162
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,054
"My dearest girl..."

163
00:21:34,157 --> 00:21:38,321
"...goodbye from the bottom of my heart"

164
00:21:38,428 --> 00:21:42,091
"How can I forget you?"

165
00:21:42,766 --> 00:21:44,825
"Grandpa, Grandma..."

166
00:21:44,935 --> 00:21:46,926
"What am I to do?"

167
00:21:47,037 --> 00:21:50,837
"How will I ever forget her?"

168
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:52,640
Miss!

169
00:21:52,843 --> 00:21:53,639
Sing with us!

170
00:21:53,744 --> 00:21:55,177
I can't sing

171
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:56,576
It doesn't matter

172
00:21:57,047 --> 00:21:59,379
Just let it out

173
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,120
"If you don't believe..."

174
00:22:05,222 --> 00:22:07,122
"...God knows"

175
00:22:07,224 --> 00:22:09,385
"Believe it or not..."

176
00:22:09,793 --> 00:22:10,623
What's your name?

177
00:22:10,727 --> 00:22:11,421
Ruoyun

178
00:22:11,528 --> 00:22:13,758
"Ruoyun, Ruoyun..."

179
00:22:13,864 --> 00:22:16,799
"There's no true love"

180
00:22:20,337 --> 00:22:21,269
Open your mind!

181
00:22:21,371 --> 00:22:21,666
Okay

182
00:22:21,772 --> 00:22:23,296
Just sing along, alright?

183
00:22:24,241 --> 00:22:26,072
Then, when I sing...

184
00:22:26,276 --> 00:22:27,038
...you follow

185
00:22:27,144 --> 00:22:27,906
Okay

186
00:22:28,011 --> 00:22:29,205
Go for it

187
00:22:45,696 --> 00:22:46,663
Ruoyun!

188
00:22:54,171 --> 00:22:55,035
Ruoyun!

189
00:23:01,978 --> 00:23:03,275
Now you can sing!

190
00:23:37,347 --> 00:23:38,871
Take care!

191
00:23:41,752 --> 00:23:43,014
Goodbye!

192
00:23:44,121 --> 00:23:45,213
Goodbye!

193
00:23:45,322 --> 00:23:46,118
Take care!

194
00:23:46,223 --> 00:23:47,656
Goodbye!

195
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,882
Hey...

196
00:25:26,857 --> 00:25:28,256
What about you?

197
00:25:32,162 --> 00:25:34,926
What happened between you and your wife?

198
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:49,479
And what's that wedding invitation in
your hand all about?

199
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:58,786
The girl I liked in college got married here

200
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:08,089
So you came for a wedding in Taidong

201
00:26:19,643 --> 00:26:20,871
Hey...

202
00:26:22,012 --> 00:26:23,912
This was three years ago

203
00:26:26,349 --> 00:26:30,683
I didn't go to her wedding three years ago

204
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:33,851
So you're three years late

205
00:26:33,957 --> 00:26:36,289
The wedding's probably over by now

206
00:26:40,697 --> 00:26:42,631
It was only after she got married...

207
00:26:44,301 --> 00:26:46,826
...that I started to miss her

208
00:26:47,704 --> 00:26:49,137
I've been wondering whether or not...

209
00:26:50,407 --> 00:26:53,570
...she's been happy since then

210
00:26:54,678 --> 00:26:57,408
I haven't seen her in ten years

211
00:27:00,283 --> 00:27:02,148
Surely it hasn't taken you ten years...

212
00:27:02,252 --> 00:27:05,221
...to find out she's your real soulmate?

213
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:09,926
Very possibly

214
00:27:10,927 --> 00:27:13,395
But she's already married

215
00:27:13,863 --> 00:27:14,830
So even you shrinks

216
00:27:14,931 --> 00:27:17,331
have shitty storylines!

217
00:27:21,037 --> 00:27:23,062
Shitty storylines indeed

218
00:27:41,524 --> 00:27:46,052
Gensheng Road... 577

219
00:28:11,154 --> 00:28:12,883
What number is it?

220
00:28:13,256 --> 00:28:14,223


221
00:28:14,324 --> 00:28:15,882


222
00:28:22,732 --> 00:28:24,324


223
00:28:31,641 --> 00:28:33,199


224
00:28:41,351 --> 00:28:43,012


225
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:47,249
We're there

226
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,834


227
00:29:00,603 --> 00:29:02,400
How can that be?

228
00:29:02,472 --> 00:29:04,337
Where's 591?

229
00:29:28,998 --> 00:29:30,090
Sir...

230
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,497
Excuse me

231
00:29:31,601 --> 00:29:34,126
Where's 591, Gensheng Road?

232
00:29:34,237 --> 00:29:35,932
591?

233
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:38,303
You're in 589 here...

234
00:29:38,374 --> 00:29:40,865
...but that's 595 over there

235
00:29:40,977 --> 00:29:42,205
Why is there no 591?

236
00:29:42,312 --> 00:29:43,142
Well...

237
00:29:43,246 --> 00:29:46,147
Some houses were demolished a while back

238
00:29:46,249 --> 00:29:48,843
It's an alley now

239
00:29:49,052 --> 00:29:50,451
So you might not find it

240
00:29:50,553 --> 00:29:51,679
Oh, I see

241
00:29:52,055 --> 00:29:54,148
So there's no longer a 591

242
00:29:54,257 --> 00:29:55,485
That's right

243
00:29:56,893 --> 00:29:58,758
Do you know of a woman

244
00:29:58,862 --> 00:30:01,160
who got married there three years ago?

245
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:03,330
Was there?

246
00:30:04,534 --> 00:30:06,297
In her thirties

247
00:30:06,402 --> 00:30:08,199
160 cm tall

248
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:10,271
Good-looking

249
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:12,273
Light-skinned and thin

250
00:30:13,243 --> 00:30:15,006
I really don't know

251
00:30:15,111 --> 00:30:17,045
No-one comes to mind

252
00:30:21,451 --> 00:30:24,386
You're sure it was in Taidong?

253
00:31:31,154 --> 00:31:32,849
You go ahead

254
00:31:45,335 --> 00:31:46,859
Then take care of yourself

255
00:31:56,512 --> 00:31:57,706
Bye bye

256
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:13,692
I want to talk to you so much

257
00:36:17,306 --> 00:36:19,774
So why couldn't I do it?

258
00:36:26,048 --> 00:36:29,211
Why can't you care more about me?

259
00:36:31,287 --> 00:36:32,413
Why don't you ever know

260
00:36:32,522 --> 00:36:34,956
what I need?

261
00:36:41,631 --> 00:36:43,496
I'm so tired

262
00:36:50,373 --> 00:36:52,136
Do you know...

263
00:36:55,244 --> 00:36:58,509
However much physical contact we have...

264
00:36:59,615 --> 00:37:03,449
...it doesn't fill the emptiness in my heart

265
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:16,320
We never really get to where

266
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:22,065
I want to go

267
00:37:31,781 --> 00:37:34,409
Now I'm sitting by the sea

268
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:39,450
Recording the words I want to say to you

269
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:46,491
But you won't hear them

270
00:37:54,136 --> 00:37:57,128
November 2nd, 2006

271
00:38:00,409 --> 00:38:03,037
Do you know where I am?

272
00:38:09,452 --> 00:38:11,818
Do you know where I am?

273
00:39:08,177 --> 00:39:10,645

283
00:40:40,669 --> 00:40:48,633
"Southern Most Point"

284
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:20,869
Yazhu...

285
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:23,569
Listen...

286
00:41:25,281 --> 00:41:27,772
This is the sound of the southernmost point

287
00:41:34,023 --> 00:41:36,924
There's still a lot I'd like to say to you

288
00:41:38,527 --> 00:41:40,051
But...

289
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,325
I think...

290
00:41:44,834 --> 00:41:46,358
I will end...

291
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:49,267
...the recording of "Sounds of Formosa" here

292
00:49:30,999 --> 00:49:34,901
It takes the most distant course

293
00:49:37,506 --> 00:49:41,237
To come nearest to yourself

294
00:49:44,146 --> 00:49:48,014
And the training is at its most intricate

295
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:55,588
When it leads to the utter simplicity of a tune.

296
00:49:59,428 --> 00:50:04,365
We have to knock at every alien door

297
00:50:05,701 --> 00:50:10,764
To finally come to our own

298
00:50:10,872 --> 00:50:14,706
To find ourselves

299
00:50:16,011 --> 00:50:20,539
It takes the most distant course

300
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:26,678
To come nearest to yourself,

301
00:50:28,557 --> 00:50:38,057
Come, come, come...

302
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:46,069
It takes the most distant course

303
00:50:47,676 --> 00:50:51,510
To arrive at the place where one started

304
00:50:53,849 --> 00:50:57,876
It is the final climb

305
00:51:00,088 --> 00:51:05,492
To arrive at absolute pastoral beauty

306
00:51:07,162 --> 00:51:12,395
We have to go through each illusory dream

307
00:51:13,301 --> 00:51:18,204
To finally come to our own door,

308
00:51:18,306 --> 00:51:21,742
To our own field

309
00:51:22,911 --> 00:51:27,541
It takes the most distant course

310
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:33,278
To come nearest to yourself.

311
00:51:34,723 --> 00:51:39,285
It takes the most distant course

312
00:51:40,562 --> 00:51:44,794
To arrive at the place one misses most.
