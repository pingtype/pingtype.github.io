1
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,730
Give me your census record

2
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,440
You have seven people in your family

3
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,800
What about yours?

4
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,480
There are five in my home

5
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,560
More

6
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,800
Seven!

7
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,690
Thanks!

8
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,390
Go over there

9
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,690
Granny, come here please

10
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,190
Where is your record consensus?

11
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,980
"Jesus! Jesus! No rice to eat."

12
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,190
"Climb on the trees to eat sweet potato."

13
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,440
"God! God! Give us food."

14
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,020
"Give us dress, give us shit..."

15
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,850
The church is sharing flour, hurry

16
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,890
OK!

17
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,140
Hurry!

18
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,890
A-chu! What's wrong with A-long?

19
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,310
Nothing!

20
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,720
Nothing! Nothing, then what's this?

21
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,520
You've no idea, it's mine

22
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,340
It's yours! What's wrong with you?

23
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,730
You are not well?

24
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,440
You got a loop?

25
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,510
I told you many times

26
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,630
The doctor in clinic is Uncle A-Shui's son

27
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,520
He's an acquaintance

28
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,090
How can you let him do the operation?

29
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,590
I didn't

30
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,810
I took pills!

31
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,630
Pills, what pills?

32
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,550
You always eat something nonsense

33
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,510
Never discuss with me

34
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,090
Do you know what will happen
after you take the pills?

35
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,800
You can't have babies!

36
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,440
The doctor said it's safe

37
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,630
Who said so?

38
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,220
Jin-ji's wife took the pills about 1 year

39
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,140
Now she can't have babies
even if she wants to

40
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,430
Hey, Big Dragon

41
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,090
Come...

42
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,470
Take it

43
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:14,940
Drink it

44
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,680
What are you afraid of?

45
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,890
They said it's effective
on the first two months

46
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,050
Two days later, it will become blood

47
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,930
Drink it!

48
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,690
You can have baby in future if you want!

49
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,270
After I have a job

50
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,840
You can have as many babies as you want

51
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,810
We can't afford a baby now

52
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,260
Right?

53
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,770
Drink it!

54
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,470
Qun-Shu!

55
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,640
The train is coming, hurry!

56
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:33,600
Boss, I cut this from a Japan magazine

57
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,760
This is for advertisement

58
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,340
The Sandwich Man

59
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,020
It's effective

60
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,840
Your theater can try

61
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,270
I won't charge you if it is useless

62
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,340
Boss, boss, see this

63
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,680
I can walk like this on the street

64
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,270
People see me, me...

65
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,720
I will dress like him

66
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,640
Wear your advertisement

67
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,980
People will see it

68
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,520
And your business will be better

69
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,480
What is this?

70
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,810
The Sandwich Man

71
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,090
Advertisement!

72
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,230
Will it be useful?

73
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,020
Yes, sir, it is useful

74
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,260
Absolutely

75
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,680
If you don't believe it

76
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,190
You can hire me for one month

77
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,310
If it doesn't work you don't have to pay me

78
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,480
Sir, how are you?

79
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,220
A-chu!

80
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,850
A-chu...

81
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,310
What are you doing?

82
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,020
Tearing our blanket to make a custom

83
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,390
The theater owner said

84
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,140
He'll hire me if I make my own clothes

85
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,510
$350 NTD a month without meals

86
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,060
A-chu, I found a job

87
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,350
We can have the baby

88
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,050
A-chu

89
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:29,430
He's the advertise man

90
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,390
Who's it?

91
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,720
Kids?

92
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,680
Bastards!

93
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,600
What are you doing?

94
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,350
Run!

95
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,130
Here! Here!

96
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,340
Come, come, and run

97
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,130
Here! Here!

98
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,060
You can't catch me!

99
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,350
Fuck!

100
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,140
Run! Run!

101
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,130
I'm here! I'm here!

102
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,520
Give it to me!

103
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,680
You can't catch me!

104
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:02,230
Give it to me!

105
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,730
Catch me if you can

106
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,770
I'm not afraid of you! I'm not afraid of you!

107
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,230
What are you doing?

108
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,390
Well, don't let me get you

109
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:12,930
What?

110
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,020
No tea?

111
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:44,140
Boss, I told you on the other day

112
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:48,230
About the new clothes...

113
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,770
What?

114
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,140
I told you on the other day

115
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:58,140
The clothes is old and its color is fading

116
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:02,640
I need a new red one, it's more eye catching

117
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,230
It might be more effective

118
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,850
Do you think the advertisement
will be more useful?

119
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,640
I don't know

120
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,600
No matter you wear red, green,

121
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:15,270
yellow, or black

122
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,930
That's your business

123
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,640
You said you will take care of the clothes

124
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,810
That's your business

125
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,800
Not mine

126
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,050
You are back

127
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:54,840
Tea?

128
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,800
Where's tea?

129
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,720
Fuck, no tea in the theater!

130
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:02,810
No tea at home!

131
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,220
What are you doing?

132
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,600
What's wrong with you?

133
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,470
You hit tables when you come back

134
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,980
And blame on me several times

135
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,600
Bacause I want

136
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,520
I can do whatever I want

137
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,050
I am the boss!

138
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,060
Don't talk so loud

139
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,760
I can talk as loud as I want

140
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,220
What the hell

141
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:34,940
You are mad when you're back

142
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,140
What makes you mad?

143
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,940
We can make tea if there is no tea

144
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,480
I wash a lot of clothes today

145
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,940
But I did not complain

146
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,520
Shout up, one more word

147
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,880
I will slap you face

148
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,230
Uncle?

149
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,520
You look like a geek in you dress

150
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,930
Who is your uncle?

151
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,380
I tried to find job

152
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,480
But can't find any

153
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,190
Can't find any

154
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,270
So you dress like this?

155
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,590
Listen,

156
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,440
as long as you try there are always chances

157
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,140
You always try to do things in easy ways

158
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,390
Of course you can't success

159
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,770
I have no choices

160
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:40,930
When I am in trouble

161
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,140
You don't lend me rice

162
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,810
Do I owe you?

163
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,480
I'm not a rich man!

164
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,440
I earn my own living

165
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,100
I have a family

166
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,380
I don't lend you my rice

167
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,190
So you wear like this

168
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,600
Shame on you

169
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:54,630
Listen

170
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,270
If you keep wearing like this

171
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,380
Move to other villages

172
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,810
Don't live here and lose my face

173
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,600
Write your son's name?

174
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,480
I cannot read

175
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,390
What's the name?

176
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,810
Hsu A-long

177
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,690
Which "long"

178
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,810
The "long" for dragon in mandarin

179
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:31,880
Born in February

180
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,020
Why don't you come earlier?

181
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,060
We just decided the name yesterday

182
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,880
You'll be fined $15 NTD for 3 months delay

183
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,850
Ah! I...

184
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,980
I don't know I have to report this

185
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,310
You don't know

186
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,970
Then how do you know how to have babies?

187
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,310
A-long, do you miss daddy?

188
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,010
See, my son loves me

189
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,510
How do you know he loves you?

190
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,590
He doesn't recognize you

191
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,230
What are you talking about?

192
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,850
When you went out in the morning

193
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,020
He was either sleeping

194
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,720
Or on my back while I did the laundry

195
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,690
When he was awake, he saw a clown

196
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,440
When you come back at night,
he slept again

197
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,350
How can he recognize you?

198
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,600
He can't!

199
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,310
To him, you look like

200
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,470
Like a big doll...

201
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,190
doll

202
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,770
I'm my son's big doll?

203
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,350
A-long!

204
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,190
I'm your big doll

205
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,350
Shut up, shut up

206
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,560
Let's talk in police station

207
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:47,940
I'm not afraid of you

208
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:51,050
He hit a kid

209
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,800
Do you think he is right?

210
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,550
He's making a fuss

211
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,100
Do you know how to drive?

212
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,230
It would be okay if kid stayed away

213
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,060
Now blame on kid again?

214
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,470
Kid knows nothing

215
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,730
Shut up, let's talk in police station

216
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:07,480
Fuck you! Let's talk to your boss

217
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,600
Shut up, send your boss here!

218
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,970
Is A-long sleeping?

219
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,100
Yes!

220
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:29,270
The Smithy was on fire this morning,
do you know that?

221
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,470
I know

222
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,560
I passed the rice miller

223
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,510
A kid broke a leg

224
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,840
What happened?

225
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,350
A car came to freight rice

226
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,520
Some rice packages fell and hit the boy

227
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:53,730
Uh...

228
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,640
You're back

229
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:22,770
Ah!

230
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,550
Qun-Shu!

231
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,810
You're advertisement is not working

232
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,510
Don't do it anymore

233
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,300
Can you ride a tricycle?

234
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,520
I can't

235
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:49,770
It's easy, just try

236
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,310
I think my theater

237
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,770
Should advertise by tricycle

238
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,390
What about me?

239
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,050
Don't worry, you're still hired

240
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,100
After riding the tricycle

241
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,230
Come help in the theater

242
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,140
I will take you to the bike dealer tomorrow

243
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,690
Yes! Yes!

244
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,440
A-chu!

245
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,060
Where's Qun-Shu?

246
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,050
Qun-Shu?

247
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,270
Qun-Shu isn't home.
What do you want for him?

248
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,390
I'm going to Taipei,
I want to sell him the tricycle

249
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,190
This one... to Qun-Shu?

250
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,770
Yes!

251
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,100
How much?

252
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,760
Whatever

253
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,020
I don't need it anymore

254
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,770
Is this true?

255
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,690
Does Qun-Shu know?

256
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,100
I haven't told him yet

257
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,690
A-chu, your husband is back

258
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,520
Qun-Shu, you're back

259
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,940
Qun-Shu

260
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,350
Can you ride a tricycle?

261
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,850
Ah... you knew it?

262
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,140
Yes, Jin-ji told me

263
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,940
He said it's okay

264
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,350
Just try several times, and you'll manage

265
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,730
What? Jin-ji?

266
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,600
Right, he said, the tricycle he'll sell us
in a good price

267
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,850
He wanted you to think about it

268
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,020
He'll meet you at the theater at night

269
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,550
Jin-ji, is it OK?

270
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,440
Is it a bad thing?

271
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,850
If so...

272
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,140
you don't have to wear the make up

273
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:24,630
Well, I mean I don't know

274
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,640
How to resign from the boss

275
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,350
Why?

276
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,440
You see, were it not because of him

277
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,520
We might not have A-long

278
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,010
We might not afford a baby?

279
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,680
Right?

280
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,810
If I have a new job

281
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,760
And forget his help

282
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,470
Can that be right?

283
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,140
What shall we do?

284
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,440
Don't worry

285
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,350
Your husband is good

286
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,770
He will success, understand?

287
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,880
Hey, where's my son?

288
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,270
He's sleeping

289
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:03,850
Big Dragon, here you are

290
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,850
Your dad is back and you're sleeping?

291
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,310
He's sucking

292
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,060
What's wrong with your son?

293
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,090
Sleeping all day long

294
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:19,020
Wake up, and keep your dad company

295
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,680
Or I will ask your mom
to wake you with water

296
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,760

00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,770
Not yet, you're dreaming

331
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,130
That's next month

332

Ha ha! Big Dragon!

333

Your Dad is back

334
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,730
Did you behave yourself, my precious son

335
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,600
Did you bother your mother?

336

344
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,310
Why are you crying? Don't cry

345
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,940
Again, what's wrong?

346
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,020
Daddy is hugging you

347
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,380
You cry in my hug?

348
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,190
You're not a good boy if keep crying, okay?

349
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,970
What's wrong, why does he keep crying?

350
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,100
What did you do? Why does he keep crying?

351
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,600
Here, come to mommy

352
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,690
I don' t know

353
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:10,310
I play with him and he started crying

354
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:11,720
I don't know why?

355
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:12,980
Good boy...

356
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,140
He's daddy!

357
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,930
Don't you recognize him?

358
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,690
What's wrong with him?

359
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,480
Well, you always draw your face like a clown

360
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,640
He can't recognize you without the make up

361
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,690
You can't recognize him, right?

362
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:34,850
Good boy...

363
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,850
Good, are you good?

364
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,770
A-long, are you good?

365
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,890
Cried so badly

366
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:52,510
He's daddy, daddy

367
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,440
Can't you recognize him?

368
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,680
Daddy!

369
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:01,050
He's not a stranger, he's daddy

370
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,180
Cry and laugh

371
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:18,770
A-long, good boy

372
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,940
Hum...

373
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:58,980
Are you crazy?
Why do you draw on your face?

374
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,050
I, I...

375
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,180
I'm my son's big doll

376
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:12,310
Mei-Li

377
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:33,020
I brought you some tooth pastes
and tooth brushes

378
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:36,180
Dad gave us some medicinal liquor

379
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:38,690
Why does your dad always send these
to us?

380
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,060
Isn't that your colleagues Wang Wu-Hsiung?

381
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:45,970
Right!

382
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:17,800
Lin Zai-Fa

383
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:18,550
Yes!

384
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,340
If I were you

385
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,310
I will not leave my wife to sell pots

386
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,510
You don't know my situation

387
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,220
As long as I work and make money

388
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,230
When the baby is born

389
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,560
I won't have to worry about money, right?

390
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:35,310
During the training

391
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,340
I found the job boring!

392
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,260
When I saw you in the training

393
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:45,090
I thought you will escape like others

394
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,940
I planned to

395
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,140
But I don't like to see

396
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,140
my family worry for me

397
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,970
Once I left my family

398
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,850
I can do anything

399
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,680
Right, you know what

400
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:01,520
When I retired from the army

401
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,760
I sent lots of resumes
like movie starts sent autographs

402
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:07,890
Hurry! Hurry! The ball is there

403
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,310
Wait for me...

404
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,090
Hey, kid

405
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,690
Can you move?

406
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,130
What do you want?

407
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,430
Are you looking for a ball?

408
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,940
Let's exchange, ok?

409
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,640
I will give you the ball
if you watch the warehouse for me

410
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,050
Are you ready?

411
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,440
Wu-Hsiung, let's go!

412
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,140
Everyone, come and see our new invention

413
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:03,020
The Japanese imported fast pot

414
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,630
It can cooked the beef soft in 2 minutes

415
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:07,520
Today I will demonstrate
how to make porridge

416
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,470
We all know

417
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,230
Usually it takes 20 minutes to make porridge

418
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:12,440
But with this pot

419
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,520
You only need 2 minutes

420
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:17,480
Just 2 minute, now...

421
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,350
Come here!

422
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,560
No

423
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,850
You can't cover it, it will explode

424
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,800
Take off the clothe

425
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,640
Don't bother, don't bother...

426
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:40,520
Water! Use water!

427
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,100
Come on...

428
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:52,730
We should use Taiwan pot

429
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:54,980
It's safer

430
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,640
Now open the pot

431
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:00,890
First we will introduce the outer pot

432
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,810
It is for direct heating

433
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:05,630
You put food in the inner pot

434
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:09,140
The rubber is

435
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:12,060
to prevent the steam from evaporating

436
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:13,440
Next...

437
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:14,850
Please

438
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:17,730
I... I was too slow to take notes

439
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,350
Cuold you repeat?

440
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,640
OK, I will say it again

441
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:32,590
This is outer pot

442
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:34,340
This is inner pot

443
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,760
This is rubber

444
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:39,640
The most important part is

445
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:41,930
This is siren

446
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,190
Mates, please pay attention!

447
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,640
When the sirens make sounds

448
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:49,100
Means the pressure in the inner pot

449
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:52,020
has reached it's maximum

450
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:55,630
At this time, if you don't turn off the fire

451
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:57,940
It will be very dangerous

452
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,560
Please!

453
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,840
Sir!

454
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,930
I just left the army

455
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:07,140
I was in engineering troops

456
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:10,130
I think asking a housewife to use the pot

457
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:11,600
Is more dangerous than digging mines

458
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:13,770
If you are not confident to our products

459
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:16,220
How can you sell it?

460
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,480
You invent the pot

461
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,640
Of course you are confident

462
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:19,440
But what about us?

463
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,730
Hey, no, no, no!

464
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,810
I'm not that good

465
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,140
The Japanese invented this

466
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,560
They used it for ten or twenty years!

467
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:32,060
We are starting to use this now!

468
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,890
Forget it! Lin Zai-Fa

469
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,980
What the fuck are you writing?

470
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,020
The company may not read it

471
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,510
Why won't they?

472
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:54,560
Read? They sent us here

473
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,340
They have cards in their sleeves

474
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,850
We don't only work for the company,

475
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,770
but for ourselves

476
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,230
You can think that way

477
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:04,600
because you are in your early twenties

478
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:06,190
But I am in my thirties

479
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,430
I have a wife and will have a kid soon

480
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,680
I cannot think like you do

481
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,350
Didn't the General Managers said...

482
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,390
Taiwan have more than
2.5 million households

483
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,770
If every ten households buy a pot

484
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,230
We can sell 250 thousand pots!

485
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,180
You still believe them?

486
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,890
250 thousand is a joke!

487
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:36,050
It's too early to give up now!

488
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:37,770
Lin Zai-Fa

489
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:39,880
Sometimes, to be confident or to be fooled

490
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,380
Is like two sides of one coin

491
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,430
You might be right

492
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:49,140
But I tried hard to get this job

493
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:52,690
Mei-Li's family always tease me

494
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,730
They went against us before our marriage

495
00:46:57,350 --> 00:47:01,770
And put me under pressure

496
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:05,480
It's hard to find a job

497
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:11,140
So I think selling pot

498
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:13,020
is doable

499
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,630
Perhaps we will succeed -Hey

500
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:21,980
Kid, wait

501
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,630
Kid

502
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:35,770
I want to thank you
to watch over the warehouse

503
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:37,220
This is for you

504
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:41,850
See

505
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,140
On the top is a laughing Buddha

506
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:45,810
I made it myself

507
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,720
It is his navel

508
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:51,810
I accidentally broke it when craving

509
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:55,140
I can see you from the hole

510
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,380
See that?

511
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:01,840
Take it

512
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,850
What are you looking at?

513
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,690
Hey, young man

514
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:29,190
Sit here, it's cooler

515
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,770
Young man, what is this?

516
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:43,880
Thermo pots

517
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:47,190
Thermo pots? What is that?

518
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:52,810
It cooks with thermal energy

519
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:55,550
What are you talking about?
I don't understand

520
00:49:56,230 --> 00:50:00,060
For instance,
when we cook beef or pork knuckle

521
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,510
It usually takes two hours, right?

522
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,050
Right!

523
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:05,050
With this it only takes 10 minutes

524
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:08,430
You can cook it well, it's time saving

525
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:11,130
Why do you want to save time?

526
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:13,850
It takes time to cook

527
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,730
or it won't taste well

528
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:21,020
Shit! The bird droppings on my head

529
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:24,180
It brings bad luck to young men

530
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:26,690
You need to have some pork knuckle noodle

531
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:28,350
What is he talking about?

532
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,640
He said "bird shit brings bad luck."

533
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:33,590
You will need to eat pork knuckle noodle

534
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,600
What the hack?

535
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:39,560
Hey, he might be right

536
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,930
Luck is not on us recently

537
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:44,440
We can't sell any pot

538
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,440
Think about it

539
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,390
We tried many ways

540
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,510
Listen, what about this?

541
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,760
Let's sell the pot in cheap price

542
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:55,470
And escape with the money

543
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,890
Don't make jokes

544
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,520
Wu-Hsiung

545
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,470
Perhaps we used wrong approaches

546
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:17,690
Let's do this

547
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:20,300
We always sell together

548
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:22,050
We should sell in two ways

549
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,840
Let's sell separately

550
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:24,970
By this way

551
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,640
We might have better performances

552
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:29,020
What do you think?

553
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,270
Hey! Hey! Kid!

554
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:34,940
Kid

555
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,050
What do you want?

556
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,090
Seafood noodle!

557
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:51,270
And you?

558
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:55,640
Pork knuckle noodle...

559
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:58,180
and a egg!

560
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,600
Pork knuckle noodle and a egg?

561
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:06,350
Young man, have some gram soup

562
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,350
Thank you! Thank you!

563
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,020
You can more if you want!

564
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,730
Want some more?

565
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:23,890
OK!

566
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:48,100
Well?

567
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:49,890
Have you sell any pot yet?

568
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:56,010
Such a nice pot

569
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:58,970
I don't know why no one want it?

570
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,640
Yes, here's a letter on your desk

571
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,980
Madam, the bowl

572
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,850
Leave it on the table

573
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:46,890
Thank you!

574
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:31,230
Come! Come!

575
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,850
How can I help you?

576
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:41,980
My dad said I shouldn't take gifts from others

577
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,730
You are a good girl!

578
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:45,310
She said she wants to see the shell

579
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:46,840
It's you, not me

580
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,060
It's you

581
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,720
Wait a second, I'll take it

582
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:54,850
The Buddha

583
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,940
Is made by that uncle

584
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:00,390
There is a hole, it's funny

585
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,940
I did not lie to you!

586
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:04,850
See the belly

587
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,690
What are you laughing at?

588
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:10,560
Nothing!

589
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,800
Are you laughing at its naval?

590
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:13,050
No...

591
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:14,130
What's your name?

592
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:16,640
Chang Chung-Hwei

593
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,520
And she?

594
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,720
Don't tell him -Lee Shiao-Chi

595
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:21,730
Lee Shiao-Chi -Busybody,
I told you not to tell

596
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:22,560
Why do you tell?

597
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,260
It's fine

598
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:25,760
Lee Shiao-Chi

599
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:27,550
Can I call you Vick?

600
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:31,430
Why do you like to wear hats?

601
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,390
Vick! Vick!

602
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:34,380
Why didn't you go to school today?

603
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:39,270
Why don't you want to see the shell?

604
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:42,050
Answer him!

605
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,520
Okay!

606
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,050
I found I like here

607
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:13,770
I like the people and view here

608
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,480
The old days of smoking
in sunset at Da-Dan county

609
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:23,390
Is far away from me

610
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:30,060
Were it not for selling the thermo pots

611
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,100
I won't leave home away

612
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:37,350
And I won't meet Vick

613
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,690
Are you still thinking of the 10-year plan?

614
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:46,560
How strange?

615
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:50,020
I found myself really like to see Vick

616
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:51,090
Every time I saw her

617
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:53,520
I have strange feelings

618
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,130
It seems like her family was misfortunate

619
00:59:58,140 --> 00:59:59,630
I heard her Mom died

620
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:01,390
But I don't know why

621
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:04,940
Well, don't over think

622
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,270
I wrote the work report for the company

623
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:09,130
Check if it is alright

624
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:14,430
I will cook the pork knuckle
with thermo pot tomorrow

625
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:16,020
I will demonstrate there

626
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:19,050
And treat free food

627
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:20,550
What do you think?

628
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:23,890
Two times a day, morning and afternoon

629
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:28,440
The cost is $120 NTD for once,
$240 NTD for twice

630
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,770
Two of us will need $480 NTD

631
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:32,050
Will the company agree?

632
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:34,720
We can try

633
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:37,100
If the company doesn't agree

634
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:38,770
We won't do it next time

635
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:42,350
I also want to help the company

636
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,560
To sell the pots soon

637
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,720
We can get more commission

638
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:50,050
If so

639
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:53,430
Mei-Li won't have to

640
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,390
work in the beauty shop in pregnancy

641
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,630
Wu-Hsiung, here's the pork knuckle

642
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:11,980
I'll leave it on the table

643
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:13,020
Clean it yourself

644
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:13,880
I'm leaving

645
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:15,020
Oh...

646
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:18,850
Bye!

647
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,230
Will see...

648
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:23,930
What?

649
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:34,270
What thermos?

650
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:35,220
I don't know! They said...

651
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:37,730
Mom! Wait for me!

652
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:40,350
Hurry... Hurry...

653
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,730
Someone is making pork knuckle...

654
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:43,890
Hurry... Hurry...

655
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:47,020
Don't be so gluttonous

656
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:50,850
Don't push! Don't push!

657
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,550
Where can I put the gas tank?

658
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,130
Leave it there..., leave it there...

659
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:09,630
Vick!

660
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:12,760
Come

661
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:19,020
Can you clean the pork knuckle?

662
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:20,260
My hands hurt

663
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:22,130
Can you help me?

664
01:03:38,270 --> 01:03:40,850
Vick! Here, sit...

665
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:44,060
Sit

666
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:58,230
Vick

667
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:01,720
This is your gift, a new shell

668
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:21,840
What thermos pot?

669
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:22,980
This is from Japan

670
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:24,520
You cook with this?

671
01:04:28,850 --> 01:04:30,350
Hey, excuse me, excuse me

672
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:31,770
How do you cook without electricity?

673
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:33,430
It's the pork knuckle

674
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:43,520
Vick, after the cigarette

675
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,130
I'll take over

676
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,380
Put the pork knuckles

677
01:04:57,430 --> 01:04:59,840
And add some fresh green

678
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:03,100
Soy sauce

679
01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:08,390
And add some MSG

680
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:14,310
OK, cover the pot

681
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:19,090
Now, turn on the fire

682
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:38,350
Thanks! Thanks!

683
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,060
Please consider...

684
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:45,930
Thank you!

685
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:05,690
Vick

686
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:27,560
It's 11!

687
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:41,770
Call 911

688
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:45,390
A-Yin, where are you?

689
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,810
Special delivery

690
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:02,090
Zai-Fa

691
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:04,310
I was afraid to tell you

692
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:07,010
After leaving the beauty shop yesterday

693
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:09,510
I fell in my way home

694
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:13,300
I found myself bleeding when reaching home

695
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:15,300
I had an injection in the hospital

696
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:18,180
The doctor said, tomorrow if I kept bleeding

697
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:20,190
I'll need to see him again

698
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:23,440
This morning, it still bleeds

699
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:25,770
I'm so scared

700
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:27,630
I know you are like me

701
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,020
We really expect

702
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:30,930
To have a baby next month

703
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:32,600
Zai-Fa

704
01:08:32,730 --> 01:08:34,690
You just started your new career

705
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:36,890
It's difficult to take a day off

706
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:38,980
But I'm very scared

707
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:41,440
I really need you

708
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,640
Please forgive my unreasonable request

709
01:08:44,230 --> 01:08:46,520
Didn't you say your colleague Mr. Wang

710
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,630
is nice to you?

711
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:51,100
Can you ask him to replace you
for two days?

712
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,230
We'll pay pack in future

713
01:08:53,350 --> 01:08:54,980
Please say thank to him for me

714
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:56,480
All the best

715
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,850
Hello

716
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:10,060
This is the junior secretary
to the ambassador of America

717
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:11,630
Yes, this is Cournel Grey.
Is the ambassador...

718
01:13:11,770 --> 01:13:13,560
Oh, Cournel Grey

719
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,760
No, he won't be in this morning

720
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:17,380
Well, I had an accident with my car
this morning

721
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,690
Oh, I've already heard about your accident

722
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:20,850
Don't worry

723
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,520
I can handle matters like these

724
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:23,880
Yeah, but the guy I hit...

725
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:25,350
Is he a labor?

726
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:26,020
Well, as far as...

727
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:26,930
Is he?

728
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:27,890
As far as I...

729
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:29,060
Is he a labor, or isn't he?

730
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:31,050
Yes. As far as I know, he is

731
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:33,880
Listen, this is an Asian country
with which we have the

732
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:36,480
closest cooperation and friendship

733
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,310
So I don't think there should be any problem

734
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:42,130
However,
the president would be very unhappy

735
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:44,890
if there was any trouble
with any of the local people

736
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,850
Or the government

737
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:47,850
Well, that's binding good

738
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:49,640
But what do I do?

739
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:51,390
I'll take care of the details

740
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,390
You take the family to the hospital

741
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,230
and I'll meet you there

742
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:56,060
OK?

743
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:57,970
Well, yeah, but I don't speak Chinese

744
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,100
That's okay

745
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:01,730
I'll have a foreign affairs police man
accompany you

746
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:02,520
Alright?

747
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:03,630
Ok

748
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:47,600
Here!

749
01:14:58,180 --> 01:14:59,220
This way!

750
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:25,010
You know this is an ideal place for kids
to play hide and seek

751
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,100
I have the same feeling

752
01:15:27,230 --> 01:15:29,890
Their new homes are nearly completed

753
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:34,980
Those apartments, over there, are new ones

754
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:38,760
Once they've moved these people out

755
01:15:38,890 --> 01:15:41,930
They're going to put up a high rise here

756
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:43,480
Yeah

757
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:55,840
Should we ask someone?

758
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:57,140
It's okay

759
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:22,890
Hey, kid

760
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:25,350
Do you know

761
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,810
where No. 8-8, Avenue 28, Sec.2,
Hsing Sheng North Rd. Is?

762
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:31,770
Do you know where Jiang A-Fa lives?

763
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,050
Oh, my god!

764
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:10,440
Hey, right there!

765
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,560
Let's go

766
01:17:28,930 --> 01:17:30,130
Excuse me, is here

767
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:31,310
8-8, Avenue 28,

768
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:33,430
Sec.2, Hsing Sheng North Rd?

769
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:36,640
Is Jiang A-Fa your husband?

770
01:17:38,430 --> 01:17:39,880
Jiang A-Fa is your father

771
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:41,850
It's here

772
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:44,390
Madam, I'm terribly sorry

773
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:48,440
But there's been a terrible accident
with your husband

774
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:51,430
Jiang A-Fa had a car accident

775
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,350
in front of the Taiwan
Tobacco & Lliquor Corp. This morning

776
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:53,890
He was hit

777
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:55,640
What did you say?

778
01:17:56,230 --> 01:17:57,190
Tell your mother

779
01:17:57,310 --> 01:17:59,270
Your father had a car accident

780
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:00,440
What is he talking about?

781
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,310
He said, dad...

782
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:03,180
What happened, tell me...

783
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:04,440
Dad had a car accident

784
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,520
Car accident?

785
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:07,970
Where is he? Is he OK?

786
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:08,850
He's fine now

787
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:10,560
He is in the hospital

788
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:11,720
He's okay

789
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:13,350
I'm here to take you to the hospital

790
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,060
What is he talking about?

791
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:16,340
He's telling us not to worry

792
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,980
Dad is in the hospital now, he's here to...

793
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:20,770
Shit!

794
01:18:20,890 --> 01:18:22,760
He's fine this morning

795
01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:25,680
Don't know how badly injured was he

796
01:18:25,810 --> 01:18:26,980
Don't worry

797
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:28,310
What a bad luck

798
01:18:28,430 --> 01:18:31,010
Got hit by a car for no reason

799
01:18:58,270 --> 01:19:00,020
She is soaking wet, help her take this off

800
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:02,810
Is she your sister?

801
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:05,440
Is he your brother?

802
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:09,230
It's her sister and brother

803
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:10,520
Oh, Jesus!

804
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,510
How many other children does he have?

805
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:16,260
Jiang A-Ji, Jiang A-Ji

806
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:20,100
What month is this month?

807
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:21,270
May

808
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:24,090
Great! When will the semester start?

809
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:27,180
March

810
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:30,390
March? You are still sleepy

811
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,520
The semester started in February,
remember?

812
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,560
It has been 3 months

813
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:36,550
Why didn't you pay your fee?

814
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:38,010
I forgot to bring it

815
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:39,430
You forgot?

816
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,310
Did you bring your lunch box?

817
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:43,380
Yes, it's in the rice steaming box

818
01:19:46,230 --> 01:19:47,810
OK! Everyone quiet

819
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:52,480
Our lesson this week is mutal aid

820
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:55,520
Mutual aid means help each other

821
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:57,510
You should help your classmates

822
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,800
When they encounter difficulties

823
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:01,890
A-Ji!

824
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:07,810
Who are you looking for?

825
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,260
I'm Jiang A-Ji's sister

826
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:11,470
My dad had a car accident

827
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,480
He was hit by an American car

828
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:15,600
Is he OK?

829
01:20:15,730 --> 01:20:16,890
I don't know

830
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:18,970
OK! Wait

831
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:22,940
Jiang A-Ji

832
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:25,060
Pack your bag and go home
with your sister now

833
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:36,560
OK! Let's start our lesson

834
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:38,470
Take out your Chinese textbook

835
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:40,140
Bye teacher!

836
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:41,980
Where is A-Chung's classroom?

837
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:43,140
Over there!

838
01:21:16,230 --> 01:21:18,940
Mrs. Jiang, don't bring any more stuff

839
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:20,640
We should go now

840
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:22,980
The hospital has things you need.

841
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:36,800
Sister! I don't want to go to school

842
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:41,050
Don't you dare to tell mom!

843
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:43,050
We don't have money to pay

844
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:45,680
Every time the teacher punish me
to stand outside the class

845
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:48,050
When Dad has money

846
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:49,180
He will pay!

847
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:50,980
Dad always says so

848
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:53,480
The teacher said the semester is going
to end

849
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,100
It's fine, be patience

850
01:21:58,230 --> 01:21:59,310
We will have money

851
01:21:59,430 --> 01:22:01,090
since they sell me

852
01:22:01,230 --> 01:22:02,810
They will sell you?

853
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,520
Yeah, it's true this time

854
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:09,480
Dad was hit by a car

855
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:14,310
What about A-Chung?

856
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:33,020
Let's go, Mom must be worried, hurry

857
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:39,760
Children are so young

858
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:40,550
That true!

859
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,720
We are unlucky recently!

860
01:22:42,850 --> 01:22:44,770
Don't worry!

861
01:22:44,890 --> 01:22:46,430
It will be fine

862
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,100
Come, come!

863
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:50,480
Hurry, hurry!

864
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:53,350
Faster, faster!

865
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:54,480
Here!

866
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:56,020
Hurry, hurry!

867
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:57,430
Tell if something happen

868
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:58,350
You sit on the back

869
01:22:58,480 --> 01:22:59,600
Okay, please help

870
01:22:59,730 --> 01:23:00,600
Hurry

871
01:23:00,730 --> 01:23:03,350
It seems that dad is hit by this car

872
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:04,940
It's huge!

873
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:07,810
OK, OK, stop looking from here

874
01:23:07,930 --> 01:23:10,300
Go, go...

875
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:21,100
Sit well

876
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:22,310
Let's go

877
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:48,850
What shall we do?

878
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,230
Fine, fine, Mrs. Jing

879
01:23:52,350 --> 01:23:54,350
Don't be so sad

880
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,980
Mr. Jiang might be slight scarped

881
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:59,890
If you kept crying

882
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:01,730
His injury might go worse

883
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:03,560
Perhaps he'll die

884
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:25,440
A-Ji is in the American car

885
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:26,850
Cool! It's huge!

886
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:28,810
Jiang A-Ji where are you going?

887
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:33,550
Jiang A-Ji! Wait for us!

888
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,020
I asked you not to be sad

889
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:07,930
We'll arrive Taipei soon

890
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:12,560
How many times should I tell you?

891
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:15,380
I do this for your sake

892
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:18,970
They said there are more opportunities
in Taipei

893
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:21,770
If I have a chance...

894
01:25:23,770 --> 01:25:25,600
Our kids are still studying

895
01:25:25,730 --> 01:25:28,560
It will be better if they study in Taipei

896
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:32,840
I heard there're places that teach mutes
to talk

897
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:34,480
If have make money

898
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:37,350
I want to take our mute kid go

899
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:39,390
So you don't need to

900
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,560
worry for our mute kid

901
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,930
Here we are, here we are

902
01:25:58,810 --> 01:25:59,980
Good morning, Sir!

903
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:02,060
Good morning, can you open the gate?

904
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:03,470
We are in a bad hurry today

905
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:04,810
Aye aye, Sir!

906
01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:32,600
How is he?

907
01:27:33,390 --> 01:27:35,470
Mr. Jiang is not in danger

908
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,350
He just broke his legs

909
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,480
He is in the surgery now

910
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,140
He will come out soon

911
01:27:41,730 --> 01:27:42,350
What did he say?

912
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,560
He said dad is alright

913
01:27:45,810 --> 01:27:46,850
This way, please

914
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:48,020
Come, here

915
01:27:57,020 --> 01:27:58,390
Please have a seat

916
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:07,520
Wait there

917
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:15,440
Let's have a look

918
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:16,480
Mom is there!

919
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:19,060
Let's play

920
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:29,590
Hurry, hurry!

921
01:28:29,730 --> 01:28:30,690
OK!

922
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:41,380
Mom, does Dad live here?

923
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:42,850
How do I know?

924
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:44,600
How long will he live?

925
01:28:44,730 --> 01:28:47,140
Naughty girl, what are you thinking about?

926
01:28:47,270 --> 01:28:49,730
Nothing, I want to use the rest room

927
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:51,260
Me, too

928
01:28:51,390 --> 01:28:53,180
I haven't pee from this morning

929
01:28:53,310 --> 01:28:54,600
I don't know where is the toilet?

930
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:56,140
Neither do I

931
01:28:56,270 --> 01:28:57,810
Where is A-Ji?

932
01:29:29,390 --> 01:29:30,720
A-Ji!

933
01:29:33,770 --> 01:29:35,270
A-Ji, come

934
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:42,980
You are bold

935
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:45,060
How dare run around

936
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:46,510
Don't you worry the Americans may
catch you?

937
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:48,130
We went to the restroom

938
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:49,380
Where?

939
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:50,850
Over there, over there!

940
01:29:50,980 --> 01:29:52,310
Go! Let's go

941
01:29:58,390 --> 01:29:59,510
Over here!

942
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:02,190
Sit on the coach

943
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:03,730
Don't run around

944
01:30:03,850 --> 01:30:04,140
OK

945
01:30:04,270 --> 01:30:05,140
Go

946
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:06,390
Go, get in

947
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:09,640
My god

948
01:30:09,770 --> 01:30:13,020
The toilet is so clean and white

949
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:17,800
Mom, should I sit or squat on the stool

950
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:19,340
I don't know

951
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:21,020
Let's try to squat

952
01:30:26,310 --> 01:30:27,600
Ah...

953
01:30:27,730 --> 01:30:28,730
I'm sorry, sorry

954
01:30:28,850 --> 01:30:30,230
Mom, what's wrong?

955
01:30:31,270 --> 01:30:32,310
A rude American came in

956
01:30:32,430 --> 01:30:33,840
He did not knock

957
01:30:33,980 --> 01:30:35,980
He blamed me did not lock the door

958
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:49,800
Brother, why is it white everywhere

959
01:30:49,930 --> 01:30:52,260
Because this is the American hospital

960
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:54,930
The chairs, the windows

961
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:57,690
The wall and lights are white

962
01:30:57,810 --> 01:30:59,560
Even the toilet paper is white

963
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:01,760
The stool is white

964
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:02,680
A-Fa...

965
01:31:02,810 --> 01:31:06,560
Be careful now, easy, be careful...

966
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:07,930
A-Fa!

967
01:31:09,020 --> 01:31:12,230
Brother, is the white man our Dad?

968
01:31:12,350 --> 01:31:13,520
Yes!

969
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:16,810
A-Fa!

970
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:18,840
A-Fa, are you OK?

971
01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:20,560
A-Fa!

972
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:21,930
Nurs, I'll be back

973
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:23,230
A-Fa!

974
01:31:23,350 --> 01:31:25,230
You two can go now, I'll take care of him

975
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:26,560
Yes, sister

976
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:31,560
My God! What happened to you?

977
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:34,770
A-Fa! What should we do?

978
01:31:34,890 --> 01:31:37,180
What should we do?

979
01:31:37,310 --> 01:31:40,140
A-Fa... A-Fa...

980
01:31:40,270 --> 01:31:42,480
Mrs. Jiang, please don't worry

981
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:45,640
Your husband surgery went well

982
01:31:45,770 --> 01:31:47,770
He will be recover soon

983
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,060
I speak Taiwanese

984
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:52,130
My name is Maria

985
01:31:52,270 --> 01:31:54,100
I work in monastery

986
01:31:54,230 --> 01:31:57,640
I'm here to serve Mr. Jiang

987
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,060
Don't worry

988
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:03,930
Mr. Jiang will be able to leave
after several months

989
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:05,390
Several months!

990
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,230
So you are asking us not to eat?

991
01:32:08,350 --> 01:32:10,480
How should we live?

992
01:32:11,890 --> 01:32:15,840
A-Fa, A-Fa

993
01:32:15,980 --> 01:32:18,440
You are unlucky

994
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:21,390
God! Why don't the American hit me

995
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,980
But you!

996
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:25,980
A-Fa!

997
01:32:26,930 --> 01:32:31,220
How misfortunate am I!

998
01:32:33,770 --> 01:32:36,690
Mom, don't cry

999
01:32:36,810 --> 01:32:38,690
The sister had left!

1000
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:42,930
So what?

1001
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:44,440
What the hell are you doing?

1002
01:32:45,430 --> 01:32:46,430
Listen!

1003
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,640
You father was seriously hit by car

1004
01:32:48,770 --> 01:32:52,020
Open your eyes to learn the situation here!

1005
01:32:54,430 --> 01:32:56,220
So are you

1006
01:32:56,350 --> 01:32:57,940
Your dad can not work

1007
01:32:58,060 --> 01:32:59,440
Don't go to school from tomorrow

1008
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:00,640
Go to work!

1009
01:33:00,770 --> 01:33:01,690
OK!

1010
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:06,690
What are you laughing at?

1011
01:33:06,810 --> 01:33:09,020
What are you laughing at? It's same to you

1012
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,890
A-Fa, are you awake?

1013
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:20,090
Are you OK?

1014
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:24,730
What happened to my legs?

1015
01:33:24,850 --> 01:33:27,100
They are broken

1016
01:33:27,230 --> 01:33:29,520
So they fixed with plaster

1017
01:33:31,890 --> 01:33:36,300
Fine, I thought I'm dead

1018
01:33:37,890 --> 01:33:39,380
Where are the kids?

1019
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:40,810
They are all here

1020
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:42,340
Here, come!

1021
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:48,680
Dad!

1022
01:33:50,230 --> 01:33:52,350
Where am I?

1023
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:57,020
American hospital

1024
01:33:57,140 --> 01:34:00,010
How do we pay?

1025
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:01,340
I don't know

1026
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:02,690
An American

1027
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:05,390
and a cop brought us here

1028
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:07,520
What did he say?

1029
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:10,630
He left without a word

1030
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:12,230
Now...

1031
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:15,310
What should we do?

1032
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:17,220
I told you

1033
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:19,730
Works are the same everywhere

1034
01:34:19,850 --> 01:34:21,940
But you want to go here

1035
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:24,520
And you said women are innocent

1036
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:27,180
Said you might be lucky

1037
01:34:27,310 --> 01:34:29,810
As I see, you are lucky

1038
01:34:29,930 --> 01:34:32,300
Very Lucky!

1039
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:38,680
Mr. Jiang you are awake

1040
01:34:49,930 --> 01:34:52,970
Mrs. Jiang, we brought some food

1041
01:34:53,890 --> 01:34:55,550
We have sandwiches

1042
01:34:55,680 --> 01:35:00,180
milk, soda, and apples

1043
01:35:05,850 --> 01:35:07,020
Mr. Jian

1044
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:08,430
This is Mr. Gray

1045
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,730
You were hit by his car

1046
01:35:10,850 --> 01:35:13,230
He's sorry and hope you can forgive him

1047
01:35:13,350 --> 01:35:15,850
And hope you can cooperate with us

1048
01:35:15,980 --> 01:35:18,140
It's you, alas!

1049
01:35:18,270 --> 01:35:20,350
You were so uncareful!

1050
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:21,600
Your car is so big

1051
01:35:21,730 --> 01:35:23,190
And you drove so fast

1052
01:35:23,310 --> 01:35:25,350
I saw your car from far away

1053
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:27,230
I tried to avoid your car

1054
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:29,480
But you still bumped on me

1055
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:30,940
Since you bumped on me

1056
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:33,640
All reasons are useless!

1057
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:36,310
Not only me that you broke,

1058
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:39,880
but all my family!

1059
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:44,270
What did he say?

1060
01:35:45,230 --> 01:35:48,730
He is very upset,
he blams you for the accident

1061
01:35:48,850 --> 01:35:50,440
Oh, I see

1062
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:52,270
You speak Chinese

1063
01:35:52,390 --> 01:35:54,010
May I talk to you for minutes please...

1064
01:35:56,980 --> 01:36:00,350
Nurs, can you help me out and translate
to the family my feelings

1065
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:03,850
First of all, I'd like to take responsibility
for the accident

1066
01:36:03,980 --> 01:36:07,230
Here's money,
and you give to them I would appreciate...

1067
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:25,310
He asked you not to worry

1068
01:36:25,430 --> 01:36:28,760
In addition to the US insurance company,

1069
01:36:28,890 --> 01:36:32,430
Captain Grey himself will pay you, too

1070
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:36,600
Your family will be fine

1071
01:36:37,350 --> 01:36:41,310
You can take the money first

1072
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:44,590
I will give you more later

1073
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:49,100
Besides, with your agreement,

1074
01:36:49,230 --> 01:36:52,730
Captain hopes to send your daughter

1075
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:54,850
to study in US

1076
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:58,390
You are lucky

1077
01:36:58,520 --> 01:36:59,980
To be hit by Captain

1078
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:01,640
If it were other people

1079
01:37:01,770 --> 01:37:05,980
You might still be lying on the street

1080
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:13,590
Thank you..., thank you...

1081
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:16,640
Sorry, sorry

1082
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:21,060
Sorry

1083
01:37:21,770 --> 01:37:22,850
Excuse me

1084
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:24,850
May I know Jiang A-Fa

1085
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:26,310
lives in which room?

1086
01:37:26,430 --> 01:37:28,180
What did you say?

1087
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:29,770
Like me, the worker

1088
01:37:29,890 --> 01:37:31,970
Whom was bomped by the car

1089
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:34,340
Do you understand what he said?

1090
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,060
I don't understand the word

1091
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:39,050
I'm sorry I have no idea what you said

1092
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:40,510
I'm sorry I can't help you

1093
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:43,510
It's cozy!

1094
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:45,230
How was it?

1095
01:37:45,350 --> 01:37:48,140
He doesn't understand me
and I don't understand him

1096
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:49,770
Come, come, come

1097
01:37:49,890 --> 01:37:51,090
Remember

1098
01:37:51,230 --> 01:37:52,640
When you get in

1099
01:37:52,770 --> 01:37:56,730
Don't be cheated, show your attitude

1100
01:37:56,850 --> 01:37:59,060
Tell them your needs

1101
01:37:59,180 --> 01:38:00,300
Otherwise

1102
01:38:00,430 --> 01:38:03,880
Bumpkin, A-Fa, almost died

1103
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:05,140
He lose his hands and feet

1104
01:38:05,270 --> 01:38:07,390
But only have three packages
of rice in return

1105
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:09,230
Remember what to do

1106
01:38:09,350 --> 01:38:10,940
Yes! Okay!

1107
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:13,480
Boss, cop

1108
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:22,190
Officer

1109
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:23,480
I'm A-Fa's boss

1110
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,770
My A-Fa was bumped by American

1111
01:38:25,890 --> 01:38:27,090
It's him

1112
01:38:27,230 --> 01:38:28,640
It's him!

1113
01:38:28,770 --> 01:38:30,850
A-Fa and his wife has a big family to raise

1114
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:32,480
They count on A-Fa's salary

1115
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:33,690
Listen

1116
01:38:33,810 --> 01:38:34,980
I did not hit him

1117
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:36,390
It's no use to tell me

1118
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:37,850
You should tell him

1119
01:39:04,930 --> 01:39:05,720
Listen, kids

1120
01:39:05,850 --> 01:39:07,390
Listen

1121
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:09,930
Who tell others how much we have

1122
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:11,730
I will sew your mouth one by one

1123
01:39:11,850 --> 01:39:13,060
Understand?

1124
01:39:13,180 --> 01:39:14,260
Yes!

1125
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:16,930
Collect the bottles

1126
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:19,100
We can sell to garbage collector

1127
01:39:19,230 --> 01:39:20,100
OK!

1128
01:39:21,270 --> 01:39:22,770
A-Fa...

1129
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:25,350
Uncle...

1130
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:31,230
A-Fa now you sit on the rice bucket

1131
01:39:31,350 --> 01:39:32,640
Hands in the money box

1132
01:39:32,770 --> 01:39:33,940
You can eat when lying

1133
01:39:34,060 --> 01:39:37,270
but we have to work like slave-dogs

1134
01:39:37,390 --> 01:39:38,800
What are you talking about?

1135
01:39:38,930 --> 01:39:40,720
Why don't I understand?

1136
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:44,480
Come on, you have 50 thousand cash

1137
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:47,190
You mute daughter can study in America

1138
01:39:47,310 --> 01:39:48,520
Who told you?

1139
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:49,510
Come on!

1140
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:50,930
I'm the boss

1141
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:52,440
If something happen to my man

1142
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:54,310
I have to know

1143
01:39:54,430 --> 01:39:55,550
Well

1144
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:58,590
The American is a nice man

1145
01:39:59,770 --> 01:40:00,980
A-Fa

1146
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:02,940
Were it because you saw the American
was driving

1147
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:05,560
So you hit the car yourself in purpose?

1148
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:07,800
Shit, A-Shiung, what are you talking about?

1149
01:40:07,930 --> 01:40:09,090
Fuck

1150
01:40:09,230 --> 01:40:12,020
You can have this if you like

1151
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:13,470
You can find an American

1152
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:15,100
and try it yourself

1153
01:40:15,730 --> 01:40:19,100
I'm kidding, don't be mad!

1154
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:23,340
I don't have the luck

1155
01:40:27,810 --> 01:40:30,350
I like to make jokes

1156
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:31,520
Come on!

1157
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:33,760
You have a good life now

1158
01:40:33,890 --> 01:40:35,430
Wearing necklace and dress in new clothes!

1159
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:38,810
That's not true!

1160
01:40:38,930 --> 01:40:42,090
See how many kids I have

1161
01:40:42,230 --> 01:40:46,190
Life will never be easy for me!

1162
01:41:36,770 --> 01:41:39,520
Behave yourself

1163
01:41:41,930 --> 01:41:44,340
You can have the banana

1164
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:46,980
We don't want banana,
we want to have apples

1165
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:50,890
No! Mom said the apples are for god

1166
01:41:51,020 --> 01:41:52,810
You can have it later

1167
01:41:52,930 --> 01:41:54,720
It's fine

1168
01:41:54,850 --> 01:41:57,770
I never had apples in my life

1169
01:41:57,890 --> 01:42:00,720
Go, one for each of you

1170
01:42:10,810 --> 01:42:11,980
It's for you

1171
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:15,060
My feet hurts, you eat it!

1172
01:42:18,180 --> 01:42:21,130
Mom, how do we eat this?

1173
01:42:21,270 --> 01:42:22,690
Like people in TV

1174
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:47,980
An apple worths 4 packages of rice

1175
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:51,690
Don't you know how to eat Apples? Hurry!
