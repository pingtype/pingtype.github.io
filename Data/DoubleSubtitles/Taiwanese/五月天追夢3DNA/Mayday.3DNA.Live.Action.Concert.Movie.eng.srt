00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,482
You are my sweet heart

172
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,734
You should be the one to have it

173
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,945
No,Dad

174
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,155
I don't want to run this restaurant

175
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,784
I want to be a star,and even sing with MAYDAY

176
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:14,539
"Love-i-n-g,Happy-i-n-g"

177
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,874
"Now,what I feel is like riding on..."

178
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,295
O.K.,Karen,I know,I know

179
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,756
I will get you the tickets

180
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:24,882
Hey,where is our order?

181
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,217
O.K.,2 people at table 3

182
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:33,891
Dad

183
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,227
You are back

184
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,604
Get change,and wash your hands

185
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,482
It's dinner time

186
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,111
O.K. O.K.

187
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,240
take that and wash this

188
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,916
No time for games?

189
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,252
Put down your book bag and let's eat

190
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,927
What are you gonna do? You big bad wolf

191
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,764
Dad,I want to go to MAYDAY's concert

192
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,185
MAYDAY? Are you kidding me?

193
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,854
It is October already...

194
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,106
MAYDAY will have a concert in Shanghai

195
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,441
It will be brilliant

196
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:27,612
Hua,Mi,Bobo will all be there,I want to go,too

197
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,405
Shanghai? You kids?

198
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,865
No! Too dangerous!

199
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,533
Please,please,please!

200
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,285
Be a good girl,O.K.?

201
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,786
Please let me go!

202
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:36,662
No£¬

203
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,624
I don't care who they are

204
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,043
No means no,I mean it!

205
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,643
Morning

206
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,270
See,what we are having for today

207
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,031
No way,are you holding a hunger strike?

208
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,494
Dear¡­

209
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,205
do you like my lipstick?

210
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,209
They are having a big sale around Time Square

211
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,877
How about we go together after work?

212
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,546
Hey,are you listening to me?

213
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,048
Hey,are you listening to me?

214
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,841
Karen,I am really busy

215
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,760
Oh,rats

216
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,015
Shing,I want to see your boss

217
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,351
- I am here.
- What do you want?

218
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,770
Honey,is everything alright?

219
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,772
Fatty,I want to talk to you

220
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,065
- Why so serious?
- Get in

221
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,360
Friend of yours?

222
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,403
Sit

223
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,240
This is my lawyer

224
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,534
I have being helping out around
this place since I was 10

225
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,453
365 days per year,1095 in total

226
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,206
5 hours per day,5475 in total

227
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:03,499
Since you're still my Dad

228
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,875
I will charge you $5 per hour

229
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,211
That will be $27375 in total

230
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:08,504
Give me my money back,fatso

231
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,007
What do you want the money for?

232
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,383
Health insurance for your old man?

233
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:13,175
Of course not!

234
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,386
Those are for the MAYDAY concert

235
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,931
Not again!

236
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,225
I told you money was not the issue here

237
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,268
Are you going to pay me or not?

238
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,228
I will sue you against the children labor law

239
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,440
Oh,that sounds bad

240
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,484
Who are you anyway?

241
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,694
None of my business

242
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,612
She offers me a free meal

243
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,655
As long as I am here,talking to you

244
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:35,990
A free meal?

245
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,075
Are you Friggen kidding me?

246
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,327
You dipshit!

247
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,957
What's that for?

248
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,431
Baby girl

249
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,352
Dad made your favorite meal

250
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,107
Baby girl

251
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,401
Dad just worry about you

252
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,613
It is really dangerous for you to travel alone

253
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,822
It's really not safe out there

254
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,783
It's really not safe out there

255
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,118
Do you hear me?

256
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,542
Dad will watch the concert DVD with you

257
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,254
It's very similar anyway

258
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,176
You can sing and dance with them as well

259
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,136
Stay here with Dad?

260
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,138
Baby girl?

261
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,350
What,Hun?

262
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:45,810
Dad,see this?

263
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,645
I can attack bad guys with this. Come in

264
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,313
I can attack bad guys with this.

265
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:50,773
Come on

266
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:52,817
Come on

267
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,027
Come

268
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:58,531
Sit,Dad

269
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,326
What is the solution here?

270
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,203
Dad,see this?

271
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,373
This is the best one

272
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:13,170
Personal security spray

273
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,300
And,the legendary ShaoLin Blade

274
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,302
It is a very powerful weapon

275
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,471
It is a very powerful weapon

276
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,641
See,how sharp it is

277
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,227
See this?

278
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,943
The cops will come and rescue me£¬

279
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,154
Don't you worry about me

280
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,243
Dad,see this bow and arrow?

281
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,705
It is the most powerful one

282
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,332
You can't miss the target at all

283
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,794
You can't miss the target at all

284
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,090
Baby girl£¬

285
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,092
These are useless

286
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:01,802
You know why?

287
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,555
These are just toys

288
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,100
Listen to me,Shanghai is too far away

289
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,353
How can you travel to such a far away place?

290
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,354
Can you stop all of this?

291
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,190
Dad,please?

292
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,192
Listen to me just once

293
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:17,985
Please stop

294
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:26,285
Dad

295
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,078
When Mom died£¬

296
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,415
You promised to take good care of me

297
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,583
But¡­

298
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,886
Honey

299
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,888
Please do not cry

300
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,851
I am sorry about the decision

301
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:54,939
Sorry

302
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,650
Baby girl

303
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,443
Baby girl

304
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:01,862
Sorry

305
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,741
I am really sorry

306
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,787
But,you have to listen to me

307
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,456
If Mom were here

308
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,292
She would take you there

309
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,963
So,please be a good girl,O.K.?

310
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:34,979
Anybody here?

311
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:36,605
Anybody here?

312
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:40,317
I want that...

313
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,236
What are you talking about?

314
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:46,031
Something about losing yourself

315
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,908
"Losing¡­"

316
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,536
"Throw away your computer£¬
throw away your backpack"

317
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,955
"What's that,what's that"

318
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,748
- "That's it,that's it"
- It's MAYDAY's song

319
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,876
Yeah,that is right,I am looking for that

320
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:57,710
At the back

321
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,211
We will help you out

322
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,672
Where?

323
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:02,798
To your left

324
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:03,591
Left?

325
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:04,383
To your left

326
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,010
This is not what I'm looking for

327
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,262
I want their tickets to the concert

328
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,472
You know? The tickets?

329
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:12,641
We don't sell concert tickets

330
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,727
What? Are you kidding me?

331
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:15,728
We only sell CDs

332
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,229
Anyway,where can I find the tickets?

333
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,230
On the internet

334
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,356
What?

335
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,650
Do you have a computer?

336
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:22,735
Computer?

337
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:24,695
No

338
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,740
Never mind,I will help you get one

339
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:28,699
Thanks

340
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,244
- I really appreciate it

341
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,957
All sold out

342
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,710
How come?

343
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,045
SOLD OUT

344
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,255
Why is that?

345
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,215
Do you think they will sell more tickets?

346
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,593
How should I know?

347
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,762
Oh,my daughter will kill me¡­

348
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,557
Anyhow,all sold out

349
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:54,725
Can you help me out?

350
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,935
I'm out,and this is dead anyway

351
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,354
Please help me out

352
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,188
Please¡­

353
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,856
Oh! I'm sorry

354
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:04,318
I told you I am out,so get out

355
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,653
What should I do?

356
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,588
I will go now

357
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:27,591
Hey,Shing

358
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:33,973
Sir?

359
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,309
Do you know where to get the tickets?

360
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,937
What tickets?

361
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:43,232
Not the train tickets,of course

362
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,151
I mean MAYDAY concert tickets

363
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,408
I've tried everywhere

364
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,327
Nuts!

365
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,022
Karen,I'm off

366
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,650
And I want to tell you something

367
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,611
Can we reschedule the MAYDAY concert?

368
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,489
What? Why?

369
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,743
I lost the tickets

370
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,536
Are you kidding me?

371
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,204
Have you looked everywhere?

372
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:39,788
Listen to me

373
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:40,539
I don't really care

374
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,041
You promised me

375
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,041
How can you be so untrustful?

376
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,209
Go to hell

377
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:02,895
Sir.

378
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,407
See this?

379
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:16,909
Clean this part

380
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:18,952
All needs to be fresh

381
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,289
Cut here

382
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,874
Use this part of the knife

383
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,877
If you did it wrong

384
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:28,545
It would be all messed up

385
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:31,882
50% of this

386
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,425
20% of that

387
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,887
And 30% of those

388
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,432
Remember

389
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,559
All the same direction

390
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,269
So it will get sticky

391
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,065
And...

392
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,609
Do you know why mine is better?

393
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:56,907
Because of this¡­

394
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,409
Tendons

395
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:07,584
O.K.

396
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,378
You know the basics now

397
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,463
I am going to tell you the recipe
for my special curry

398
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,466
Here are all the ingredients for making the curry

399
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,261
However,this is not the point

400
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,812
Look at yourself

401
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:10,689
Come on

402
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,610
See? You have to make it with love

403
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,153
See? You have to make it with love

404
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,821
Can you feel love here?

405
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,996
Lele is back

406
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,123
You are off

407
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,876
How are you feeling today?

408
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,717
"Staying up with you"

409
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,595
"Till I'm completely sick is fine"

410
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,597
"Going shopping with you"

411
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,642
"Till I become flat-footed is fine"

412
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,435
"Thank you so much"

413
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,480
"For bringing me to life,in awe of you"

414
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,357
"To rediscover the meaning of"

415
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:40,445
"L-O-V-E"

416
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:45,409
"Love-ing,happy-ing"

417
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,452
"Now what I feel"

418
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,247
"Is like a ride on a jet"

419
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:55,085
"Love-ing,change-ing"

420
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:58,588
"We change the dusk and the dawn"

421
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:03,010
"With you,my heart thumps unbearably hard"

422
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,014
"You are like air"

423
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,975
"Your smell is even better than air"

424
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,893
"You are like sunshine"

425
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,896
"Shedding light on the midnight"

426
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:16,773
"We live by water"

427
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,609
"Cook congee with water to sustain our life"

428
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:26,700
"You are like vitamin. L-O-V-E"

429
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:31,705
"Love-ing,happy-ing"

430
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,790
"Now what I feel"

431
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:36,585
"Is like a ride on a jet"

432
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:41,465

"We change the dusk and the dawn"

434
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:49,514
"With you,my heart thumps unbearably hard"

435
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:12,496
"No matter what time what date"

436
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,832
"What I feel for you remains unchangeable"

437
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:21,296
"Would never be forgotten. L-O-V-E"

438
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,840
"L-O-V-E,L-O-V-E"

439
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:28,512
"L-O-V-E,L-O-V-E"

440
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,391
"L-O-V-E,L-O-V-E"

441
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:38,438
"L-O-V-E,L-O-V-E"

442
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:43,360
"L-O-V-E,L-O-V-E"

"L-OVE"

446
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,917
Give yourself a big applause

447
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,504
Love you all

448
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:09,094
"Love-ing,happy-ing"

449

"Crying in the crowd"

457
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:18,330
"You just want to become invisible"

458
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:24,836
"No dream,ach,or broken heart"

459
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:28,089
"You've decided"

460
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:31,301
"You've decided"

461
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:35,847
"You quietly endure"

462
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:41,978
"Tightly grasping yesterday in your fist"

463
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:48,818
"The sweeter the memories are,the more they hurt"

464
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,946
"Leave all the profound cuts"

465
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:57,911
"In your palm"

466
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:04,251
"You're not truly happy"

467
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:11,049
"Your smile is just a disguise you wear"

468
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:14,177
"You've decided not to hate"

469
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,930
"Not to love"

470
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:22,686
"You lock up your soul forever"

471
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:27,857
"You're not truly happy"

472
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:34,573
"Your wounds are unwilling to be completely healed"

473
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,367
"I stand beside you"

474
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:40,370
"But it's like we're separated by a galaxy"

475
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,080
"If all of these were ture"

476
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:46,042
"Would you tightly hold your remorse"

477
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:50,463
"Until the day you are too old to regret"

478
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:05,937
"You're not truly happy"

479
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:12,652
"Your smile is just a disguise you wear"

480
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,655
"You've decided not to hate"

481
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,450
"Not to love"

482
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:24,247
"You lock up your soul forever"

483
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:29,085
"You're not truly happy"

484
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:36,176
"Your wounds are unwilling to be completely healed"

485
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,970
"I stand beside you"

486
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,765
"But it's like we're separated by a galaxy"

487
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,558
"If all of these were ture"

488
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:47,520
"Would you tightly hold your remorse"

489
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:52,776
"You deserve to be happy"

490
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:59,449
"You should pull off that disguise you wear"

491
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,202
"Why do you have to be punished"

492
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:05,121
"After all the lost?"

493
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:12,003
"Can you let your agony end at this moment?"

494
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:29,270
"Start to relive again!"

495
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:20,530
"I'm most afraid of a sudden stillness"

496
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:27,328
"I am most afraid of friends' concern"

497
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,081
"I'm most afraid of memories"

498
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:34,878
"Suddenly engulfing me in sorrows
that won't subside"

499
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,130
"I'm most afraid of suddenly"

500
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:41,050
"Hearing news about you"

501
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:47,307
"If nostalgia had a sound"

502
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:55,231
"I'd rather it not be mournful weeping"

503
00:37:55,523 --> 00:38:02,238
"These days at last I belong fully to myself"

504
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,532
"With my tears to remind me"

505
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:08,787
"How I've fooled myself"

506
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:12,874
"Suddenly missing you"

507
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:16,252

509
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,596

"Suddenly engulfing me in sorrows
that won't subside"

516

517
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:03,508
"Hearing news about you"

518
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,010
"I'm most afraid that in this life"

519
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:10,932
"Which I've already determined to live without you"

520
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,268

Hey,Wen

524
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:44,674
What's up?

525
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:46,593
Nothing

526
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,761
Just want to say...

527
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,346
Hi

528
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,312
I...

529
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,622
Richie,stop calling me

530
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:46,462
I'm fine,and we're over

531
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,055
Taxi,Taxi

532
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,560
Bro. take it or not?

533
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:05,481

534
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,023
Hey,where you going?

535
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,024
I have no idea

536
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,151
I don't know where I'm going

537
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:53,196
I just want to go,far away from here

538
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,406
Just drive

539
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:58,910
As far as you can

540
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:02,306
Sorry

541
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,477
It's fine.

542
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:18,489
You like MAYDAY?

543
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:20,116
Yeah

544
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:24,245
You going to their concert next week?

545
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,622
You mean Shanghai?

546
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:29,417
I bought the tickets

547
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:31,127
But not going anymore

548
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:32,795
Why?

549
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,593
I was going to propose to my girlfriend

550
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,177
Really big surprise for her

551
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,430
Then go to Shanghai for our honeymoon

552
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,348
And the MAYDAY concert

553
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:47,977
But¡­

554
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,106
Not any more

555
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:56,319
Sorry about that

556
00:44:58,029 --> 00:44:58,863
I'm fine.

557
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,115
How about you?

558
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:21,010
Stop the car

559
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,304
Stop!

560
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:55,419
That's him

561
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:56,837
That's really him

562
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:00,383
People warned me before,but I refuse to believe

563
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,179
That's him

564
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:08,307
29 minutes before,I opened the door

565
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,809
Seeing him and the other woman£¬

566
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,143
lying on my couch

567
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,979
Even wearing my coat

568
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,022
So it's over...

569
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:47,138
What do you want?

570
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,506

How would you do?

584
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,851
I believe in you

585
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,648
When we were together

586
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:28,776
I really believe in you

587
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,364
Right now

588
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,158
When you leave

589
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,537
I still believe in you

590
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,211
Wishing you all the best

O.K.

596
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,595
How can you write under such conditions?

597
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,681
Write what?

598
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:23,849
What are you doing anyway?

599
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:24,975
Just want to take a note
