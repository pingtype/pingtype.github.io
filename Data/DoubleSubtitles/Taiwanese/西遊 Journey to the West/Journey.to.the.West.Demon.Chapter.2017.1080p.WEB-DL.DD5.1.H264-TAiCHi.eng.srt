1
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:49,966
Humans? So tiny!

2
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,055
Why poke my foot?

3
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,807
Monk Tang. Monk Tang.

4
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,267
Over here!

5
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,020
Look this way, I'm here!

6
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,816
You've been asleep for ages.
We wanted to wake you. Listen!

7
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,319
We have good news.

8
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,613
Sorry.

9
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,032
Sorry. Sorry.

10
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:18,036
Monk Tang,
we have great news to tell you.

11
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,663
Congratulations!

12
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,875
You're in the place
you've always dreamed of.

13
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,504
-This is India?
-Correct!

14
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,464
India.

15
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,509
I've reached my destination at last!

16
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,719
Sorry.

17
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,850
Master.

18
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,605
You've shrunk too?

19
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,157
Master, why are you in India too?

20
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:59,035
Monk Tang, you haven't let me down.

21
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:04,290
You wanted 22 sutras.
They're loaded on 10 horse carts.

22
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,710
They're yours if you want them.

23
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,086
Help yourself.

24
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,213
But the main reason I'm here today...

25
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,841
...is to give you an award.

26
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,092
What award?

27
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,261
For living this long.

28
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,189
Try it on.

29
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:32,027
What an honour.

30
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,072
I like it.

31
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,490
Discreet or bold...

32
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,200
...you control it.

33
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,536
The right side is brighter, you see?

34
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,080
You can even it up.

35
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,207
May we ask for a few words?

36
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:49,461
I.... I need to think about it.

37
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,549
Master! What is going on?

38
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,801
Have fun!

39
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,655
CIRCUS FREAK SHOW

40
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:22,118
Monk! Pay your way or the boss
will throw you out. Stop sleeping!

41
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,205
I know.

42
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:31,294
Blindfolded knife-throwing!
Amazing physical feats!

43
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,172
Roll up, roll up! Don't miss this!

44
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,768
Our guest stars
are travellers heading west.

45
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,604
The pig, the fish and the monkey.

46
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,648
Greatest show on earth.

47
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,441
Only 2 cents per person.

48
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:54,693
How about half price?

49
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,695
Buy one, get one free?

50
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,698
It's a deal, thank you.

51
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,242
Showtime.

52
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,704
The gorgeous Pigsy!

53
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,206
Woman....

54
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,712
-What's your name? Your age?
-Crazy!

55
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,382
The great fish monster, Sandy!

56
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,356
How dare you scare my kid!
Shame on you! Money back!

57
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,569
Making me angry?

58
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,572
Money back!

59
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:41,823
Don't.

60
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,910
Don't be rash. We have more
to show you. Give us another chance.

61
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,789
If we don't like them,
you pay everyone back double!

62
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,751
All right.

63
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,338
His Excellency, the Monkey King!

64
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,971
Fake! Money back!

65
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,224
Monkey, do some somersaults!

66
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,226
Paying back double will clean us out!

67
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,240
All right. Thanks for the vegetables.

68
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:28,203
Your generosity will keep us fed
for several days.

69
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,205
Boss, this monk cheats!

70
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,291
He can't pay us back! Throw him out!

71
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,752
You're a disgrace to my circus! Scram!

72
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,505
How can you fit in here
with such stunts?

73
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,257
Boss, we're not circus people.

74
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,634
We are Buddhist monks.

75
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,261
Our road is long and hard.
We are hungry.

76
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,764
And I'm sick!

77
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:52,686
My body aches.
It's been days since I last ate.

78
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,230
So pitiful? Come....

79
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,316
These two buns...

80
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,068
...are for righteous men.

81
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,904
Men who deserve help.
Are you worthy?

82
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:07,283
We're really from the Great Tang
Dynasty. We conquer demons.

83
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:12,455
Monkey, show them your skills.

84
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,055
Hit me.

85
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,225
-Hit me.
-I can't do that, Brother Monkey.

86
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,311
I'm not suicidal.

87
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,439
Shall I hit you, then?

88
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,482
I'd like that even less, Brother Monkey.

89
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,277
Fine, you only live once, I'll hit you.

90
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,657
Brother, you're hard as a rock!

91
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,993
It's as if my whole arm is shattered!

92
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,079
Pretty boy, have you no shame?

93
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,665
Watch some more before you complain.
And stop poking me.

94
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:56,833
I need to!

95
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,881
Hit me. Master wants us to perform.

96
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,050
I'm hungry, I have no strength.

97
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,887
Hungry? That's no excuse for shirking.

98
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,306
Hit me, stupid!

99
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,142
I've heard there are
fake demon-vanquishers around.

100
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,936
They've left many people hurt.
You must be the ones!

101
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,688
Yes, we're guilty.

102
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,691
The problem is that
my disciples are too strong.

103
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,735
Sure, you just keep on bragging.

104
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,584
One blow is enough. Stop now.

105
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:47,550
That'll do for now.

106
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,721
You're so desirable!

107
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,683
Let me stoke your fires a little.

108
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,226
No! Get off me!

109
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,520
Monkey, don't just squat there.

110
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,772
Do something about it!

111
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:34,597
I'm so sorry, that's really all from us.
No charge for what you've just seen.

112
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:39,644
Great, sir. Your performance
is more than impressive.

113
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,062
Say no more.

114
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,857
Try this candied fruit, let us be brothers.

115
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,235
Brother, now you've seen
what they can do.

116
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,404
I wish
they could control themselves better.

117
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,908
-We really do conquer demons.
-Of course you do.

118
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,537
Monkey, come and apologise!

119
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,088
Pick up your headband.

120
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,302
Put it on.

121
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,764
Wear it properly now!

122
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,600
I'm doing it.

123
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,770
You talk while chewing a twig?
Bad monkey!

124
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:27,067
I won't if you don't like it.

125
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,071
But stop calling me "Bad monkey"!

126
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:36,076
I can call you that if I want to.
Bad monkey! Bad monkey!

127
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,078
Great.

128
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,789
Say it just one more time....

129
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:44,209
You're angry? Makes me so scared!
Aren't you all afraid?

130
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,252
Let's do this together--

131
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,303
Don't be scared.

132
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,098
Even if he throws tantrums,
you can't be lenient.

133
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,849
Let's all scold him together.

134
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,101
One, two, three....

135
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,978
Bad monkey!

136
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,402
<i>My boy, my boy</i>

137
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,946
<i>Why are you so bad?</i>

138
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,157
<i>Bullying, cheating</i>

139
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,077
<i>Why make me so sad?</i>

140
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,621
<i>Learn to be a good boy</i>

141
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,290
<i>Learn to love</i>

142
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,335
<i>Care for others</i>

143
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,713
<i>Fill your heart with colour</i>

144
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,049
<i>My good boy</i>

145
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,760
<i>Hurry back to me</i>

146
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,097
<i>My embrace</i>

147
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,269
<i>My good boy</i>

148
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,813
<i>Be sincere</i>

149
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:51,026
<i>You're the one I love most</i>

150
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,582
Master, ours is just a small enterprise.

151
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:08,209
What you see is all we have.

152
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:13,173
If it's not enough for you,
then all we can offer is our lives.

153
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,595
First, I'm not here
to extort anything from you.

154
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:19,929
Second....

155
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,390
Never mind, I won't say it.

156
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:25,453
Journey to the West:
The Demons Strike Back

157
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:40,427
When did your mother
start behaving like this?

158
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,013
A few days ago.

159
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,264
I don't know why.

160
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,890
Soon after we moved here...

161
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,393
...she began talking nonsense.

162
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,395
If I approach her...

163
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,315
...she scratches me like a mad thing.

164
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,318
I have no idea why she's like this.

165
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,362
I'm completely exhausted.

166
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,614
Luckily my two daughters...

167
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:04,743
...help me take care of my mother.

168
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,787
It wears them out.

169
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,165
They're your daughters?

170
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,750
Goddaughters.

171
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,044
-How old are they?
-They just turned 16.

172
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,755
They look a little haggard.

173
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,549
They've been working too hard.

174
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,217
They were radiant before.

175
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:22,969
What a sense of humour!

176
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,221
Grandma, have some congee.

177
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,891
You haven't eaten all day.

178
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,351
Another fit?

179
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,774
Ma, are you all right?

180
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,400
Ma, Ma, Ma....

181
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,277
It's me.

182
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,619
-Quick! The exorcism mirror!
-Coming up!

183
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,329
Ten thousand gods...

184
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,748
...send down thunderbolts
to reveal the hidden demons!

185
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,584
Show yourself!

186
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,299
All demons, be revealed!

187
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:09,182
Nothing?

188
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:13,186
But the whole room smells foul.

189
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,605
If it's not her body, then...

190
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,358
...maybe she has second sight.

191
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,984
She sees the demons in others.

192
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,195
That's why she's so scared.

193
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,990
Could it be those two?

194
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,121
I've put up with them for too long.

195
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,540
All demons, be revealed!

196
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:39,671
Too bright! I can't see anything!

197
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,340
What? Not them either.

198
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,552
Could it be...?

199
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,438
A hairy crab!

200
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,871
You bad monkey!

201
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,545
You bad monkey!

202
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,380
Bad monkey!

203
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:27,927
Brother, look at that.

204
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:31,264
Master's whip is really strong today.

205
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,767
That whip has kept Monkey
under control for 500 years.

206
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,102
It needs to be strong.

207
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:54,162
You knew those two were shape-shifters.
Why didn't you stop them?

208
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,706
You asked me to perform, so I did!

209
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,500
And what did you perform?

210
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,753
I asked for a couple of somersaults
and you destroyed a family!

211
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,089
Then you shouldn't have
called me "Bad monkey."

212
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:07,801
You know that makes me go berserk.

213
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,887
I didn't mean to call you that.

214
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:14,766
Everyone knows I don't mean it.
Such a small thing...

215
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,811
...and you try to kill me?
Open your mouth!

216
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,190
Wider!

217
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,612
Now I'm offering you my life.

218
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,323
Bite! You're a coward if you don't.

219
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,160
Bite! Do it.

220
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:37,622
Come on! You wanted to kill me, right?

221
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,878
Why did you treat me like that?

222
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,506
Speak! Say something!

223
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,634
Why do you keep doing it?
Cheating me! Provoking me!

224
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:53,263
Hurting me! Torturing me!
Mistreating me!

225
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:59,019
It seems our days
of conquering demons...

226
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,272
...have come to an end.

227
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,276
Let's disband.

228
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,486
"Disband"?

229
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,614
Does "disband" mean
he wants to kill us?

230
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,744
Master!

231
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,537
Master....

232
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,248
I understand
why Master does these things.

233
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:25,211
But please drink this medicine first.
From now on, I'll be obedient.

234
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:29,799
What are you saying?
I'm not punishing you.

235
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,762
Master, you surely know...

236
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:37,724
...my brothers and I,
we are all of one heart.

237
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:41,019
If you punish Brother Monkey,
then my heart aches too.

238
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,481
And my heart is really aching!

239
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,276
That's so true.

240
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:50,403
When I hit you, my heart really aches.

241
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,864
Master, try it if you don't believe us.

242
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,952
When I punish you...

243
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,455
...I suffer heartache too.

244
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:04,668
If I'd set off to find the sutras on
my own, I'd have got there long ago.

245
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:09,631
Having you with me doesn't help at all.
I can subdue 100 foes single-handedly.

246
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,549
But I prefer to hide my powers.

247
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:16,638
My Buddha's Palm is so powerful,
but, again, keeping a low profile.

248
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:20,058
So it's not that you're helping me
to find the sutras.

249
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:23,228
I'm helping you to make merit
and learn Buddhism.

250
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:25,522
Do I make myself crystal clear?

251
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,273
Do you get it?

252
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,317
Yes, we do.

253
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,156
That's enough for now.

254
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,784
Think about what I've said.
Meeting over.

255
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,213
<i>Sinful monkey!</i>

256
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,426
<i>I'll show you my Buddha's Palm!</i>

257
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:32,797
Did you miss me?

258
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,760
Master's mind has reached
such a high level...

259
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,595
...he's even teasing Brother Monkey.

260
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,349
That's not Brother Monkey
he's embracing.

261
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,517
It's someone else.

262
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:00,909
-Amitabha, Amitabha.
-Master, you seemed happy last night.

263
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,870
We were happy to see you happy.

264
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,747
But we won't tell on you.

265
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,708
What are you on about?

266
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,586
No water left.
Second Brother, fetch some water.

267
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:15,256
Why do I have to do it?
How did you come up with that idea?

268
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:18,385
-Why don't you go?
-Stop quarrelling, I'll go.

269
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,440
Almsgiver, excuse me.

270
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:34,109
I was just passing.

271
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,778
May I trouble you for water to boil rice?

272
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,698
There's no need for that.

273
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,741
You're welcome to eat here.

274
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,618
I'm a vegetarian.

275
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:47,831
What luck!
We're having vegetarian food.

276
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,291
We're devout too,
we share the same path.

277
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,419
It's natural for us to share our meal.

278
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,130
And you can stay after eating.

279
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:58,633
We'll be able to compare notes.

280
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:02,387
He's ill, won't he taste bad?

281
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:06,224
Never mind, we can heal him first.

282
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,768
It would be impolite to refuse.

283
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,021
No need to cook! Come and eat here!

284
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:12,731
What about my congee?

285
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,108
I prepared it this morning.

286
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,694
Your congee will be burnt.

287
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:20,155
Go back and watch the fire.

288
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:46,639
Almsgiver, your medicine works a treat.

289
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,600
I feel better already.

290
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:52,062
These three are my delinquent disciples.

291
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,125
Nice to meet you.

292
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:17,128
Nice to meet you.

293
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:18,755
Nice to meet you.

294
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,341
Nice to meet you.

295
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:26,262
Don't flirt.

296
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:29,849
Nice to meet you.

297
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,227
To hell with that, what's nice about it?

298
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,521
Sandy, what are you saying?

299
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,314
I was cooking congee.

300
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:39,067
Master, what are you up to?
"Nice, nice, nice...."

301
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:41,152
What do you all think you're doing?

302
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:43,697
I'm sorry, my disciple is
a touch simple-minded.

303
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,241
-It doesn't matter.
-May I just ask you...

304
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:48,326
...are there any demons here?

305
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:51,246
Master, please don't scare me.

306
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:54,374
Why would there be demons here?
You're going too far.

307
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,836
Why ask such a question?

308
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,213
Actually...

309
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,674
...we conquer demons.

310
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:05,093
I did wonder. Really?

311
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,263
You've been so hospitable,
but we have nothing to repay it.

312
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,974
All I can offer is a one-off exorcism.

313
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:14,269
Really? You're terribly kind.

314
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:16,396
But, sad to say...

315
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,898
...there are no demons here.

316
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:22,736
See my face?

317
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,863
Hit me.

318
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,073
Come on, quick!

319
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,243
If you don't, I'll beat you to death!

320
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:33,997
Really? Why?

321
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,252
Scum!

322
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,129
I told you to hit me.

323
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:43,089
I'll ask you again.

324
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:47,260
Hit me, you asshole!

325
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,931
Have you lost it again?

326
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,433
I'm not an asshole!

327
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,062
You definitely are. But I was calling her
an asshole, not you.

328
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:59,314
Damn you!

329
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,275
You assholes take me as your master?

330
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,361
Clear out of here!

331
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:06,363
Sorry about that.

332
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:07,989
Get out, all of you.

333
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:09,908
She kindly invited us to eat.

334
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:13,370
You bang her table
and ask her to hit you...

335
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:16,081
...and call her an asshole.
Go and face the wall.

336
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,083
Contemplate what you've done.

337
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:20,210
What have you ever contributed
to society?

338
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:22,879
Don't come back until you figure it out.

339
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:35,183
Come back!

340
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,436
-We haven't figured it out yet.
-Don't give it any more thought.

341
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:41,773
-Come back!
-Still contemplating it.

342
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,485
Don't bother, she's caught me!

343
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,059
Rake!

344
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:24,315
Up, up!

345
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:26,776
Quick, up! Quick, up!

346
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:31,865
Fine, that's enough.

347
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:33,700
You can stop now.

348
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:02,020
Master, time to show your hand.

349
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:05,106
You're so kind.

350
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,002
Such long legs!

351
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:28,755
-Such long legs.... I like them.
-What are you doing?

352
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:37,806
I'm a spider!

353
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:39,724
You must be kidding!

354
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:42,644
I'm just a pig.

355
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:44,104
I wasn't kidding.

356
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,530
Your resistance makes me stronger.

357
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:12,984
-What's that noise?
-Don't worry, it's Sandy.

358
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:16,112
Sandy, are you all right?

359
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:19,574
A bit poisoned, a bit dazed.

360
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:28,541
Seems like time for me to step in now.

361
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:31,461
Conquering demons takes sincerity.

362
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:32,921
Lead them to benevolence.

363
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:36,299
No violence necessary.

364
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:41,971
Without a knife,
a butcher can be a Buddha.

365
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:18,341
Stop!

366
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:21,428
Monkey.... You are too rude.

367
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:24,556
Save your strength
to help your brother.

368
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:26,433
Let me handle this.

369
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:35,025
Brother Monkey, be more gentle.

370
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:38,194
Don't hurt her long legs.
I've only just gotten started with her.

371
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:42,032
-Master, maybe I can talk to her first?
-Quiet.

372
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,161
Let go--

373
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:16,066
All done, Master.

374
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:19,736
What?

375
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:21,863
You finished her
before I had a chance!

376
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,281
What were you thinking?

377
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:26,201
You were in great danger.

378
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:28,370
She could have swallowed you whole.

379
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:31,581
You're lucky I strike fast.
I took her out with one blow.

380
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:35,126
How many times have I told you?
To conquer a demon, educate it.

381
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:37,504
Didn't you see the smile
on her face just now?

382
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:41,549
Smile? She smiled
at the prospect of eating you.

383
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:45,387
Outrageous!
That smile was so sincere.

384
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:49,099
My smile is even more sincere.

385
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:52,394
Guess: Do I love you?
Or will I kill you?

386
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:02,779
Who the hell are you?
How can I help you?

387
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:19,629
Did you see that? He's so handsome.

388
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:21,715
You're almost better-looking than me.

389
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:24,050
You know that?

390
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:26,594
Of course. You can't stand it?

391
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:29,097
Of course not, how about you?

392
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:31,307
What's Baldy doing up there?

393
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:33,059
Thinking.

394
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:34,644
About what?

395
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:35,937
About Miss Duan.

396
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:46,197
I don't care who he's thinking about!

397
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:49,451
This bald fellow.... I can overlook
his propensity for violence...

398
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:51,786
...but he's started going too far.

399
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:54,330
Lying beside me,
swaying and fondling...

400
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:56,499
...asking if I miss him.

401
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:58,126
Just thinking of it...

402
00:31:58,293 --> 00:31:59,878
...gives me goosebumps.

403
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:02,005
Well, that needs to stop.

404
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:03,465
Why not just kill him?

405
00:32:04,257 --> 00:32:05,842
You couldn't do that, could you?

406
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:10,263
You always dance to Baldy's tune.
Just forget it.

407
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:13,308
I'll pull out his tongue...

408
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:15,060
...and tie it in a knot!

409
00:32:15,226 --> 00:32:17,145
What kind of tune would he sing then?

410
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:20,190
He still knows
the Buddha's Palm technique.

411
00:32:20,357 --> 00:32:21,441
I'm not scared.

412
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,360
If I break his arm...

413
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:25,362
...how can he use
Buddha's sodding Palm?

414
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:35,538
Master, how long
have you been standing there?

415
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:38,541
Just now.
I came to see how you're doing.

416
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:40,669
Don't worry, I heard nothing.

417
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:44,547
Master...

418
00:32:44,714 --> 00:32:46,257
...how come you lost your voice?

419
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:48,176
I haven't.

420
00:32:48,343 --> 00:32:50,637
Out here in the wild...

421
00:32:50,804 --> 00:32:53,473
...we shouldn't disturb others
by being loud.

422
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,058
-Really?
-For sure.

423
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:58,895
Have I ever lied to you?

424
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:01,147
All right, you all relax.

425
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:03,358
I'll just relieve myself.

426
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,628
Buddha, Buddha,
my three disciples are unruly.

427
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:25,630
I have failed to teach them well.

428
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:28,758
I know 300 songs for children,
but nothing else.

429
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:31,845
I've been pretending to be capable.

430
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:33,763
How can I go on like this?

431
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,224
Now Monkey is plotting to kill me...

432
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:38,685
...and I've lost my singing voice.

433
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:40,895
Be merciful, Buddha.

434
00:33:41,312 --> 00:33:43,898
Teach me your holy Buddha's Palm.

435
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:47,110
Your follower will be forever grateful.

436
00:33:50,822 --> 00:33:53,992
I beg you, please.

437
00:33:56,286 --> 00:33:59,289
Buddha, do you hear me?

438
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:01,541
Give me a sign.

439
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:04,586
Even a little fart would do.

440
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:16,014
Pigsy, how long have you been there?

441
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:18,475
Not long, I didn't see
what you were doing.

442
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:20,935
Don't worry,
I didn't hear anything either.

443
00:34:23,938 --> 00:34:25,607
I've been good to you, haven't I?

444
00:34:25,774 --> 00:34:28,360
You know what you should do.

445
00:34:28,526 --> 00:34:30,236
What should I do?

446
00:34:30,403 --> 00:34:32,530
All I can do is be myself.

447
00:34:32,697 --> 00:34:34,491
What I was getting at is...

448
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:38,036
...silence is golden.

449
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:40,246
Master, all I did was break wind.

450
00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:42,374
But all your threats and pressures...

451
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,752
...weigh on me heavily.

452
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:50,382
So that's your game.
Your master knows many butchers.

453
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:52,509
-You should watch out.
-Understood.

454
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:05,980
Monkey, what are you thinking?

455
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:13,446
-You're the one who needs to watch out.
-I'd like to experience...

456
00:35:13,613 --> 00:35:15,824
...my master's holy Buddha's Palm.

457
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:19,035
What are you talking about?
What palm?

458
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:20,787
You didn't get it?

459
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:24,332
Just the two of us.
I want to compare strength.

460
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:30,630
You run?

461
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,523
<i>My boy, my boy</i>

462
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:51,568
<i>Why are you so naughty?</i>

463
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:53,445
<i>Bullying, cheating</i>

464
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:55,905
<i>Why behave that way?</i>

465
00:35:57,407 --> 00:35:59,284
<i>Learn to behave better</i>

466
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:01,202
<i>Closeness, love</i>

467
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:02,954
<i>Be tender in your heart</i>

468
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:05,165
Damn Baldy, enough with the singing!

469
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:07,083
Fight me!

470
00:36:07,584 --> 00:36:10,337
<i>Good child</i>

471
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:36,446
Run. Where can you run to?

472
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:39,324
All right.

473
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:42,285
If that's what you really want,
I'll indulge you.

474
00:36:43,328 --> 00:36:45,121
So it's clobbering time.

475
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:47,290
Wait, give me a moment.

476
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:09,062
I was just toying with you, Master.

477
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:12,399
Just working up a sweat.

478
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:17,696
You scared me to death.

479
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:38,341
-What on earth are you up to now?
-None of your business.

480
00:37:38,508 --> 00:37:41,011
You're so handsome, you've gone bald.

481
00:37:41,177 --> 00:37:42,345
Do you mean that?

482
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:45,640
I'd be a pig if I lied.

483
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:51,980
How did it go?
Did you tear Baldy to shreds?

484
00:37:52,147 --> 00:37:56,067
Was his blood running everywhere?

485
00:37:57,402 --> 00:37:59,779
Wait, have you really killed him?

486
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:03,074
You tricked me!

487
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,472
Pigsy, have you learned
what "silence is golden" means?

488
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:28,600
I just did.

489
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:40,904
Now you're poisoned, I have to pull you.

490
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:57,337
Will you please stop dousing me?

491
00:38:57,504 --> 00:39:00,757
I caught a cold, my nose is runny.

492
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:04,469
Caught a cold? Bullshit!

493
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:06,638
Better take a cleaver to you
and sell you in the market.

494
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:08,765
Less trouble for me that way.

495
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:13,019
Monkey, when do you think
Sandy will turn back into a man?

496
00:39:13,186 --> 00:39:15,021
I have no idea.

497
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:17,941
Master, you really want to know?

498
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,193
Maybe...

499
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,528
...not.

500
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:25,323
Bi-Qiu Kingdom

501
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:16,541
The minister is here!

502
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:17,917
Hail, Your Eminence.

503
00:40:33,558 --> 00:40:36,853
Master Tang is an eminent monk indeed.

504
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,230
His bearing is graceful.

505
00:40:39,856 --> 00:40:43,735
My admiration is heartfelt.

506
00:40:58,083 --> 00:40:59,376
It's a pleasure to meet you.

507
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:04,422
May I ask how Your Eminence knew
I was coming? I am flattered....

508
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,716
Most flattered.

509
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:08,927
Master Tang's reputation precedes him.

510
00:41:09,094 --> 00:41:11,554
And your three brilliant companions...

511
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:15,517
...are also awe-inspiring.
I learned that the four of you...

512
00:41:15,684 --> 00:41:17,268
...would pass by here.

513
00:41:17,435 --> 00:41:20,730
The king sent me to greet you here.

514
00:41:21,314 --> 00:41:24,025
Let's go to the palace.

515
00:41:26,361 --> 00:41:28,488
We can chat there.

516
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:35,954
Neat trick.

517
00:41:36,913 --> 00:41:39,457
It's just a trifle.

518
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:48,133
-Don't play any more tricks.
-It wasn't me. I didn't do anything.

519
00:41:48,299 --> 00:41:50,051
What did I do?

520
00:41:57,225 --> 00:41:58,685
Bloom.

521
00:41:58,852 --> 00:42:00,729
Hey, presto.

522
00:42:03,523 --> 00:42:06,443
Your Eminence, it puzzles me.

523
00:42:06,985 --> 00:42:09,154
Are your magic tricks...

524
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,655
...intended to seem fake?

525
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:14,325
Master, we both know
that in this world...

526
00:42:14,492 --> 00:42:17,037
...magic tricks are illusions.

527
00:42:17,203 --> 00:42:20,915
Why care whether
they seem real or fake?

528
00:42:21,082 --> 00:42:22,709
Let's go.

529
00:42:27,964 --> 00:42:30,342
Cultivating oneself is different
from playing tricks.

530
00:42:30,508 --> 00:42:32,218
The crucial thing...

531
00:42:32,385 --> 00:42:33,762
...is what's in the heart.

532
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:36,598
Master...

533
00:42:36,973 --> 00:42:38,933
...you are bottling something up.

534
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:41,311
What's on your mind?

535
00:42:42,187 --> 00:42:44,439
There's someone in your heart.

536
00:42:44,606 --> 00:42:48,985
You yearn for her. You can't forget her.

537
00:42:49,903 --> 00:42:51,654
I'm afraid you're wrong, there's not.

538
00:42:51,821 --> 00:42:54,366
Learning humanity
is like having religious faith.

539
00:42:54,532 --> 00:42:58,787
Following your heart
will keep you young.

540
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,124
A person who can't be honest
with himself...

541
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:06,544
...is hypocritical.

542
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:09,047
That's why I cultivate myself...

543
00:43:09,214 --> 00:43:11,800
...according to my heart's desires.

544
00:43:13,426 --> 00:43:16,388
So what "cultivation" means to you is....

545
00:43:16,554 --> 00:43:19,140
Doing what I damn well like.

546
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:32,737
Is this what pupils do
between lessons in your country?

547
00:43:32,904 --> 00:43:36,032
It's a game, losers have to kneel.

548
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:38,702
The king has been taking
rejuvenation pills lately.

549
00:43:38,868 --> 00:43:40,662
Now he behaves like a child.

550
00:43:41,705 --> 00:43:44,916
It's as if he took my counsel
about following his heart.

551
00:43:47,377 --> 00:43:49,879
The king is easily coaxed.

552
00:43:50,046 --> 00:43:51,423
Simply fawn on him...

553
00:43:52,674 --> 00:43:56,261
...and you'll be well-rewarded.

554
00:43:56,428 --> 00:43:58,304
I'll expect my cut, of course.

555
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:00,640
That's....

556
00:44:00,807 --> 00:44:03,643
I'm just joking.
You didn't think I was serious?

557
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:07,605
Look, our beauties are greeting you.

558
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:12,110
Impressive, I like it!

559
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:21,161
Your Majesty,
the honourable guests are here.

560
00:44:21,327 --> 00:44:23,747
I am Tang.
I am crossing your great country.

561
00:44:23,913 --> 00:44:26,374
My three disciples and I are here
to pay our respects.

562
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:28,835
Hug, hug!

563
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,050
Splendid.

564
00:44:36,843 --> 00:44:38,678
Look, this king is sillier
than our master.

565
00:44:38,845 --> 00:44:39,846
No way.

566
00:44:40,013 --> 00:44:42,474
No one is sillier than our master.

567
00:44:47,604 --> 00:44:49,272
Hug, hug!

568
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:52,317
Please respond in kind
to the king's high protocol.

569
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:57,322
Too late, he's too stuck-up.

570
00:44:57,864 --> 00:44:59,657
Hug, hug!

571
00:45:01,785 --> 00:45:02,994
Follow your heart.

572
00:45:06,915 --> 00:45:08,333
I hear that you conquer demons.

573
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,251
It's true.

574
00:45:10,418 --> 00:45:13,088
Don't believe it, show me some tricks.

575
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:16,633
I think Your Majesty is confused.

576
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,094
Conquering demons
is not an acrobatic trick.

577
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:22,514
You will do as I order!

578
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:24,766
You will speak as I order!

579
00:45:24,933 --> 00:45:27,977
If you don't obey, you insult my dignity!

580
00:45:28,144 --> 00:45:31,523
Now I'll have your head chopped off.
I'll use it as my night potty.

581
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:34,067
Great, this king gives his people
what they like.

582
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:36,861
-My kind of king.
-Men, off with his head!

583
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:40,657
Don't worry.

584
00:45:42,033 --> 00:45:43,243
Really, Minister?

585
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:46,621
-It's a joke.
-I see.

586
00:45:46,788 --> 00:45:48,540
It doesn't seem so.

587
00:45:48,707 --> 00:45:50,333
Doesn't seem what?

588
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:55,422
Your Majesty, I have a dream.
We can perform a bit for you.

589
00:45:55,588 --> 00:45:58,550
Monkey, show His Majesty a few tricks.

590
00:45:59,676 --> 00:46:01,761
You ask a nobody to entertain me?

591
00:46:01,928 --> 00:46:03,555
That's a deliberate insult!

592
00:46:03,722 --> 00:46:04,973
Death penalty!

593
00:46:06,057 --> 00:46:08,560
Don't try to talk me out of it, I'll perform.

594
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:12,188
Just give me a moment
and I'll be with you.

595
00:46:13,481 --> 00:46:15,150
Get a move on!

596
00:46:15,525 --> 00:46:17,986
Master, are you really going to perform?

597
00:46:18,153 --> 00:46:20,989
Do I have any choice?

598
00:46:28,913 --> 00:46:30,665
He can't get through.

599
00:46:31,124 --> 00:46:32,167
What should we do?

600
00:46:32,334 --> 00:46:34,502
No big deal,
just show them your Buddha's Palm.

601
00:46:35,879 --> 00:46:38,381
It's not a parlour trick.

602
00:46:38,548 --> 00:46:41,301
How about I take Master's form?
I can perform for the king.

603
00:46:41,801 --> 00:46:43,636
You just want to have your way
with the maids...

604
00:46:43,803 --> 00:46:46,139
...so Master will leave dozens
of children here.

605
00:46:50,185 --> 00:46:51,227
Come, come.

606
00:46:51,394 --> 00:46:52,520
Stick, stick, stick!

607
00:46:53,688 --> 00:46:55,231
I know what.

608
00:46:55,398 --> 00:46:56,900
Use the talisman of obedience.

609
00:46:57,609 --> 00:46:59,694
That again? That's an old idea.

610
00:47:00,028 --> 00:47:02,030
It will have to do, boss.

611
00:47:02,197 --> 00:47:03,865
New ideas are thin on the ground.

612
00:47:04,032 --> 00:47:05,408
Stick it on him...

613
00:47:05,575 --> 00:47:07,243
...and he'll do whatever I do.

614
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:09,371
Identical movements.

615
00:47:54,457 --> 00:47:57,544
Damn it, chop him up!

616
00:47:58,169 --> 00:48:01,172
Out of the question. I'll be doomed
if you do a striptease again.

617
00:48:01,339 --> 00:48:02,882
You don't trust me.

618
00:48:03,049 --> 00:48:04,384
I don't.

619
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:08,096
I'm sincerely trying to help.

620
00:48:09,222 --> 00:48:11,433
And you really don't trust me?

621
00:48:12,726 --> 00:48:15,353
-I don't.
-If you find that something goes wrong...

622
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,730
...you can always stop me.

623
00:48:17,939 --> 00:48:20,984
-You won't cheat me?
-I look like a cheat?

624
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:23,445
Have I ever cheated you?

625
00:48:23,611 --> 00:48:26,156
-More times than I can remember.
-You're right.

626
00:48:26,322 --> 00:48:29,075
You're no use to us, you're an asshole.

627
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:43,882
Good.

628
00:48:56,186 --> 00:48:57,771
Stop it.

629
00:49:03,151 --> 00:49:06,321
What is he doing?
You want to make me lose face again?

630
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:08,448
Move.

631
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:17,165
Out of the way.

632
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:27,050
What kind of dance is that?

633
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:31,304
I specialise in striptease.
Master isn't as good as I am.

634
00:49:33,515 --> 00:49:35,767
Where did he go?

635
00:49:41,272 --> 00:49:44,693
-Stop!
-Don't stop.

636
00:49:45,151 --> 00:49:48,196
No stopping. If you shout "stop" again,
I'll have your head.

637
00:49:48,363 --> 00:49:50,156
You are joking?

638
00:49:51,241 --> 00:49:55,036
Master, he's not joking. If you shout
"stop" again, you'll lose your head.

639
00:49:55,704 --> 00:49:56,788
Go on, then.

640
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:04,587
Wonderful.

641
00:50:04,754 --> 00:50:07,215
Great, great.

642
00:50:08,425 --> 00:50:12,220
Great! Master, any more tricks
up your sleeve?

643
00:50:16,558 --> 00:50:17,976
Go to hell!

644
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,228
Go to hell!

645
00:50:21,896 --> 00:50:24,566
-Go to hell again!
-Go to hell again!

646
00:50:30,613 --> 00:50:32,323
He hit me.

647
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:35,285
He hit me!

648
00:50:39,497 --> 00:50:40,707
Hurry! Quick!

649
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:44,419
You must flee right away
if the king cries.

650
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:58,308
Master, I did my best to help you...

651
00:50:58,475 --> 00:51:02,687
...but after what just happened,
I'm afraid that...

652
00:51:04,022 --> 00:51:05,857
...your reputation...

653
00:51:06,024 --> 00:51:07,275
...cannot be repaired.

654
00:51:08,026 --> 00:51:09,861
Attendants.

655
00:51:10,236 --> 00:51:14,240
Here's some money for expenses.
Use it on your travels.

656
00:51:14,991 --> 00:51:18,244
Don't show up here again
for eight to 10 years.

657
00:51:18,411 --> 00:51:20,372
How can I accept, after all that...?

658
00:51:20,538 --> 00:51:22,582
Forget it. Meetings are hard...

659
00:51:22,999 --> 00:51:24,834
...but partings are harder.

660
00:51:25,001 --> 00:51:26,836
You and I...

661
00:51:27,003 --> 00:51:29,923
...may not meet again.

662
00:51:30,715 --> 00:51:33,301
Take care, Tang Tang.

663
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:39,557
The minister fancies you.

664
00:51:39,724 --> 00:51:41,559
How about that, Master?

665
00:51:41,726 --> 00:51:43,728
You have a good chance with her.
I envy you.

666
00:51:43,895 --> 00:51:47,899
With all your piety,
you can still get dates.

667
00:51:48,525 --> 00:51:51,611
You bad monkey!
There's no limit to your mischief!

668
00:51:51,778 --> 00:51:54,864
I feared it might go wrong,
but I didn't expect to risk my life.

669
00:51:55,407 --> 00:51:56,950
Now kneel to me.

670
00:51:57,117 --> 00:52:00,537
I'll beat you until you kneel! Kneel!

671
00:52:00,954 --> 00:52:02,080
Beat away.

672
00:52:02,247 --> 00:52:05,834
Did you ever think how it feels
to demean yourself in front of people?

673
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:07,961
Now you know what crazy dancing
feels like.

674
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:09,504
So you know how bad I feel!

675
00:52:09,671 --> 00:52:12,465
You tell me to kneel
like a dog before you.

676
00:52:12,632 --> 00:52:14,467
You know how humiliating that is?

677
00:52:14,634 --> 00:52:16,928
You're right. I did manipulate you.

678
00:52:17,095 --> 00:52:19,681
So that you'd know how indignity feels.

679
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,060
I see.

680
00:52:24,227 --> 00:52:26,146
Now that you've said all that...

681
00:52:26,312 --> 00:52:28,898
-...I'll finish you off with one slap!
-Go ahead!

682
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:32,444
I'm ready for it.
I'd rather die than suffer this torture.

683
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:34,112
All I wanted was to tell you:

684
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:36,823
Do unto others...

685
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:39,534
...as you'd wish them to do unto you.

686
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:55,258
I'm sorry, I'm at fault.

687
00:52:58,094 --> 00:53:00,430
Stop, don't try that on me.

688
00:53:03,308 --> 00:53:06,186
You're right, we should treat others
as we wish to be treated.

689
00:53:07,062 --> 00:53:10,607
I've punished you by making you dance,
by taking away your dignity in public.

690
00:53:12,734 --> 00:53:15,153
Now I realise
what a loss of dignity feels like.

691
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:19,366
I've been wrong
to call you "Bad monkey."

692
00:53:19,532 --> 00:53:23,078
I've beaten and scolded you all day long.

693
00:53:23,244 --> 00:53:26,498
I've been oblivious to your feelings.

694
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:30,919
The problem here is me, not you.

695
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:34,881
I'm the one who spreads unhappiness.

696
00:53:35,507 --> 00:53:37,967
Now I realise my mistakes.

697
00:53:38,134 --> 00:53:40,553
Please forgive me this once.

698
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,847
Give me one more chance, forgive me.

699
00:53:45,058 --> 00:53:47,018
Master's conscience
is awakened at last.

700
00:53:47,644 --> 00:53:49,729
Don't you see what he's doing?

701
00:53:49,896 --> 00:53:53,692
Master is skilled at tricks like this.
This is "advance by retreating."

702
00:53:54,192 --> 00:53:56,486
To admit a mistake at the right time...

703
00:53:56,653 --> 00:53:58,655
...can win people's hearts.

704
00:53:59,906 --> 00:54:01,282
Master often seems silly...

705
00:54:01,449 --> 00:54:03,702
...but he knows how to manage risk.

706
00:54:05,912 --> 00:54:07,497
Master...

707
00:54:08,331 --> 00:54:10,792
...I guess I overdid it.

708
00:54:11,876 --> 00:54:13,128
Please get up.

709
00:54:16,214 --> 00:54:17,841
I actually care a lot for you.

710
00:54:18,008 --> 00:54:20,301
I just didn't know how to express it.

711
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:24,639
Master, I know in my heart
how you feel about me.

712
00:54:24,806 --> 00:54:27,434
From now on, though,
don't ever make me do crazy dancing.

713
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:32,272
But frankly speaking, Monkey,
you're good at it.

714
00:54:32,439 --> 00:54:34,274
Don't even think that, Master.

715
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:35,942
Please stop calling me "Master."

716
00:54:36,109 --> 00:54:37,944
We're sworn brothers for life.

717
00:54:38,611 --> 00:54:41,823
So just call me "Elder" from now on.

718
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:44,617
Elder.

719
00:54:46,745 --> 00:54:48,246
Elder!

720
00:54:49,122 --> 00:54:51,541
See that, Pigsy? How well it works?

721
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:54,878
They're all but kissing. Impressive, no?

722
00:54:56,379 --> 00:54:59,841
No entry to the palace,
on pain of death!

723
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:03,053
-Pardon us, we wish to see the king.
-Master....

724
00:55:04,888 --> 00:55:07,515
-Why are you back?
-Minister, I've been thinking.

725
00:55:07,682 --> 00:55:09,434
I can't leave things as they were.

726
00:55:09,601 --> 00:55:11,936
I need to restore my reputation.

727
00:55:12,687 --> 00:55:14,939
Master, please get away
while you still can.

728
00:55:15,106 --> 00:55:17,442
If you come back, there'll be carnage.

729
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:21,738
Minister, I value my reputation. How
can I be a good monk with a bad rep?

730
00:55:31,456 --> 00:55:32,749
How dare you return!

731
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:35,293
Your Majesty, please calm down.

732
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:38,755
-Monk Tang has something to say.
-Your Majesty, please calm down.

733
00:55:38,922 --> 00:55:40,882
What happened before
had nothing to do with me.

734
00:55:41,049 --> 00:55:43,468
It was all caused by my errant disciple.

735
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:45,720
So I've brought him
to apologise to you.

736
00:55:45,887 --> 00:55:47,472
And while we're about it...

737
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:49,641
...we'll conquer a demon or two.

738
00:55:49,808 --> 00:55:51,226
Monkey.

739
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,613
Come on, hit me.

740
00:56:04,447 --> 00:56:05,573
Are you a pervert?

741
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:07,033
Brilliant.

742
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,120
A game is just the thing
to appease the king.

743
00:56:10,286 --> 00:56:13,498
Master Monkey, let me run through
the rules of this game.

744
00:56:19,421 --> 00:56:23,675
Master, I don't think
we'll meet again in this life.

745
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:31,016
Hit me.

746
00:56:33,601 --> 00:56:34,853
Can't you do it harder?

747
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,772
You haven't eaten yet, is that it?

748
00:57:06,718 --> 00:57:08,595
Out of the way!

749
00:57:11,556 --> 00:57:13,016
Danger!

750
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:46,466
Red Boy.

751
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:48,760
-Monkey.
-You show your true face at last.

752
00:57:49,886 --> 00:57:52,972
I saw from the start there was something
odd about you. According to legend...

753
00:57:53,139 --> 00:57:55,767
...you own the long Firecloud Spear.
And move on...

754
00:57:56,142 --> 00:57:58,061
...the flaming Golden Wheel! Well met!

755
00:57:59,479 --> 00:58:01,231
So you're the Monkey King.

756
00:58:02,357 --> 00:58:05,360
Let's see your tricks.
Show your senior the best you can do.

757
00:58:33,304 --> 00:58:34,889
Foul play?

758
00:58:36,266 --> 00:58:37,934
You ain't seen nothing yet.

759
00:58:49,571 --> 00:58:51,031
Master, over here.

760
00:59:44,626 --> 00:59:46,211
Three-Tier Fire!

761
00:59:46,378 --> 00:59:49,005
Take that!

762
01:00:43,226 --> 01:00:46,730
The palace.... It's in ruins.

763
01:00:48,106 --> 01:00:49,899
Ruins!

764
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:53,528
Stupid monkey, don't hide!

765
01:00:53,903 --> 01:00:56,072
Come out to face me!

766
01:02:29,666 --> 01:02:31,334
My turn!

767
01:02:43,471 --> 01:02:44,806
Help!

768
01:02:44,973 --> 01:02:46,182
Help!

769
01:02:46,725 --> 01:02:48,393
Gentlemen, was there an earthquake?

770
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:51,312
Please rescue me, I've wet myself.

771
01:02:51,479 --> 01:02:53,189
Your Majesty.

772
01:02:54,482 --> 01:02:55,775
Wait.

773
01:02:57,986 --> 01:02:59,988
Let me do it.

774
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,754
What a cute, little monster.

775
01:03:16,379 --> 01:03:19,341
I've subdued it, keep it as a souvenir.

776
01:03:19,507 --> 01:03:23,303
I will chant sutras day and night
until its evil nature is defeated.

777
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:24,846
I'll do my best.

778
01:03:27,932 --> 01:03:29,642
The king.

779
01:03:31,061 --> 01:03:33,063
Your Majesty!

780
01:03:36,649 --> 01:03:38,401
Thank you, Your Reverences.

781
01:03:38,568 --> 01:03:41,321
We have our real king back at last.

782
01:03:41,488 --> 01:03:44,366
We've prepared lavish gifts for you.

783
01:03:44,532 --> 01:03:46,493
See for yourselves.

784
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:01,841
The palace's 3000 beauties.

785
01:04:02,175 --> 01:04:04,552
-Choose which you like.
-All for me?

786
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:07,013
Too few? You can have the throne too.

787
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:08,431
Calm down, Your Majesty.

788
01:04:09,432 --> 01:04:11,101
His Majesty is offering...

789
01:04:11,267 --> 01:04:13,728
...ladies-in-waiting for your journey.

790
01:04:13,895 --> 01:04:16,648
-So it is.
-I'm grateful for his generosity, but I....

791
01:04:16,815 --> 01:04:18,692
You think we're the types
to accept such a gift?

792
01:04:18,858 --> 01:04:20,777
Women make us seriously ill.

793
01:04:20,944 --> 01:04:23,446
Put me in charge of them,
see how badly I treat them all.

794
01:04:23,613 --> 01:04:26,408
Come on, the fish is getting very dry.
Put that to good use.

795
01:04:26,574 --> 01:04:28,159
Your saliva smells bad.

796
01:04:28,326 --> 01:04:30,453
Don't be picky.

797
01:04:33,081 --> 01:04:34,290
Master, kindly accept them.

798
01:04:34,457 --> 01:04:35,917
-At least one or two.
-Yes.

799
01:04:36,584 --> 01:04:39,504
There's no rush,
I'll handle them one by one.

800
01:04:39,963 --> 01:04:43,174
If Your Majesty insists on repaying us,
maybe I can suggest something?

801
01:04:43,675 --> 01:04:45,969
Could you free these ladies?

802
01:04:46,136 --> 01:04:49,597
Sure, no problem.
Anyone who wants to leave can leave.

803
01:04:49,764 --> 01:04:52,684
No blame attached, you have my word.

804
01:04:53,309 --> 01:04:54,352
Your Majesty...

805
01:04:54,519 --> 01:04:57,939
-...aren't you being too generous?
-I feel like crying. All those women...

806
01:04:58,106 --> 01:04:59,691
...they're ugly-looking gluttons.

807
01:04:59,858 --> 01:05:03,069
Any one of them could eat
a whole cow for breakfast.

808
01:05:03,236 --> 01:05:04,446
You can go, you're free.

809
01:05:04,612 --> 01:05:07,490
Being imperial concubines is fine.
Why would we want to leave?

810
01:05:07,657 --> 01:05:09,909
Damned bald monk,
who do you think you are?

811
01:05:10,076 --> 01:05:13,288
-If you stir things up, we'll sort you out!
-You think we're vain?

812
01:05:13,663 --> 01:05:15,874
We're sacrificing ourselves
on the altar of love!

813
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:17,876
Monk Tang, get out! Protect our love!

814
01:05:18,043 --> 01:05:20,337
Monk Tang, get out! Protect our love!

815
01:05:20,503 --> 01:05:22,213
Monk Tang, get out! Protect our love!

816
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:24,716
Monk Tang, get out! Protect our love!

817
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:28,345
See how they love you?

818
01:05:28,928 --> 01:05:30,305
I'll kick your balls!

819
01:05:30,472 --> 01:05:32,349
-I'm sorry.
-You'll never have children.

820
01:05:32,515 --> 01:05:35,310
Calm down, you can all stay.

821
01:05:40,065 --> 01:05:42,275
I want to die.

822
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:52,118
-That one.... That one is....
-Me?

823
01:05:52,285 --> 01:05:55,663
You, the one in black at the back.

824
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:57,665
How come I've never seen you before?

825
01:05:57,999 --> 01:05:59,459
This lady is a newcomer.

826
01:05:59,626 --> 01:06:01,336
She's a songstress.

827
01:06:04,172 --> 01:06:06,174
What's your name?

828
01:06:07,008 --> 01:06:10,470
-Felicity.
-Since you're a songstress...

829
01:06:10,637 --> 01:06:12,681
...give us a quick song...

830
01:06:12,847 --> 01:06:16,017
...to send the masters on their way.

831
01:06:16,184 --> 01:06:17,769
Yes, sire.

832
01:06:34,202 --> 01:06:36,079
As a monk, I renounce you.

833
01:06:59,102 --> 01:07:00,812
<i>Yesterday, today</i>

834
01:07:00,979 --> 01:07:04,649
<i>The past has slipped away</i>

835
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:08,987
<i>Without makeup</i>

836
01:07:09,154 --> 01:07:13,950
<i>Colours fade</i>

837
01:07:14,367 --> 01:07:18,163
<i>All through history</i>

838
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:22,375
<i>Love endures</i>

839
01:07:22,917 --> 01:07:26,046
<i>Your love awaits your return</i>

840
01:07:26,671 --> 01:07:30,050
<i>Wandering beyond the clouds</i>

841
01:07:32,427 --> 01:07:35,096
<i>Love sickness</i>

842
01:07:35,263 --> 01:07:37,724
<i>Begets sorrow</i>

843
01:07:39,809 --> 01:07:42,854
<i>In this world</i>

844
01:07:43,021 --> 01:07:47,275
<i>Fate is immutable</i>

845
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:51,029
<i>Let it go</i>

846
01:07:51,654 --> 01:07:56,409
<i>We cannot be together</i>

847
01:07:56,576 --> 01:08:03,249
<i>Is this truly our destiny?</i>

848
01:08:08,421 --> 01:08:11,549
Splendid! Her artistry is magnificent.

849
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,021
Master.

850
01:08:25,647 --> 01:08:26,856
What is it?

851
01:08:27,023 --> 01:08:30,527
His Majesty asks if you'd like Felicity
to accompany you on your travels.

852
01:08:30,694 --> 01:08:31,736
Out of the question!

853
01:08:31,903 --> 01:08:34,239
I'm going west to find sutras
and cultivate myself.

854
01:08:34,406 --> 01:08:36,616
She couldn't make
such an arduous journey.

855
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:39,160
I have burned incense
and prayed to Buddha.

856
01:08:39,327 --> 01:08:40,662
I am a devout Buddhist.

857
01:08:40,829 --> 01:08:42,997
We must brave the elements
with little to eat.

858
01:08:43,373 --> 01:08:45,542
A young woman couldn't endure it.

859
01:08:45,709 --> 01:08:48,420
I'm not afraid, my family was poor.

860
01:08:48,837 --> 01:08:51,297
I've done household chores
since I was young.

861
01:08:51,464 --> 01:08:54,801
-I'm accustomed to hardship.
-Wonderful!

862
01:08:54,968 --> 01:08:56,261
What touching words.

863
01:08:56,428 --> 01:08:57,887
This songstress....

864
01:08:58,054 --> 01:09:00,807
She can sing, dance, cook, and wash.

865
01:09:00,974 --> 01:09:04,978
What a resource,
at home and on travels.

866
01:09:05,145 --> 01:09:08,273
-Still....
-Master, you really don't want her?

867
01:09:09,482 --> 01:09:10,942
I don't.

868
01:09:11,901 --> 01:09:13,028
You won't regret it?

869
01:09:13,528 --> 01:09:14,779
No regrets.

870
01:09:14,946 --> 01:09:17,949
Master, please take time to reflect.

871
01:09:18,116 --> 01:09:20,535
I'll ask you once again.
You don't want her?

872
01:09:21,036 --> 01:09:23,455
-I don't.
-You must be kidding!

873
01:09:23,621 --> 01:09:26,541
Such a charming girl!
Why don't you want her? You're weird!

874
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,086
Minister, please arrange this right away.

875
01:09:30,253 --> 01:09:33,882
I want the girl cleaned up
and sent to my chambers.

876
01:09:34,049 --> 01:09:35,258
As soon as possible.

877
01:09:36,134 --> 01:09:37,344
Your Majesty....

878
01:09:43,433 --> 01:09:46,436
We'll take our leave now.

879
01:09:51,816 --> 01:09:54,319
Attendants, see them out.
Help them with the fish too.

880
01:09:54,486 --> 01:09:56,154
Come with me.

881
01:10:37,362 --> 01:10:39,364
<i>When you've suffered pain...</i>

882
01:10:39,781 --> 01:10:42,492
<i>...you know the pain</i>
<i>of all sentient beings.</i>

883
01:10:46,705 --> 01:10:48,331
<i>When you've insisted...</i>

884
01:10:48,498 --> 01:10:50,625
<i>...you know how to let go.</i>

885
01:10:50,792 --> 01:10:54,087
<i>When you've cared for others,</i>
<i>you know how to move on.</i>

886
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:57,465
<i>That's what spiritual attainment</i>
<i>is all about.</i>

887
01:10:59,092 --> 01:11:00,677
<i>But me...</i>

888
01:11:00,844 --> 01:11:03,013
<i>...I'm just an ordinary man.</i>

889
01:11:06,933 --> 01:11:08,393
Your Majesty....

890
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,479
Your Majesty, the master is back again.

891
01:11:13,565 --> 01:11:16,317
Master, you have broken your journey.

892
01:11:16,484 --> 01:11:18,069
What trouble did you encounter?

893
01:11:18,403 --> 01:11:20,989
I've been pondering,
I don't think I should reject...

894
01:11:21,156 --> 01:11:22,782
...Your Majesty's great generosity.

895
01:11:22,949 --> 01:11:25,785
Please allow Felicity to join me
on my journey.

896
01:11:27,412 --> 01:11:29,748
You can do that, right?

897
01:11:30,832 --> 01:11:32,292
I can, but....

898
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:36,254
-But what?
-Last night, I had my way with Felicity.

899
01:11:39,132 --> 01:11:42,052
Tell you what, choose someone else.

900
01:11:45,263 --> 01:11:46,431
Master...

901
01:11:46,598 --> 01:11:49,225
...I sympathise,
but there's nothing I can do.

902
01:11:51,269 --> 01:11:54,230
You mean.... But I don't mind.

903
01:11:55,148 --> 01:11:57,067
Your Majesty has favoured Felicity.

904
01:11:57,233 --> 01:11:59,819
-That makes me all the more honoured.
-You don't mind?

905
01:12:00,445 --> 01:12:01,529
Definitely not.

906
01:12:01,696 --> 01:12:03,281
You don't mind...

907
01:12:03,448 --> 01:12:05,158
...but I mind.

908
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:10,330
The fact of the matter is...

909
01:12:10,497 --> 01:12:12,332
...Felicity resisted him last night.

910
01:12:12,457 --> 01:12:13,958
She refuses to be a concubine.

911
01:12:14,125 --> 01:12:16,961
She says she'd rather die
than be forced into it.

912
01:12:18,338 --> 01:12:21,841
-Then yes.
-I lied to you!

913
01:12:22,008 --> 01:12:23,593
So what?

914
01:12:24,302 --> 01:12:26,763
Yesterday I asked you eight times...

915
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:28,390
...and eight times you refused.

916
01:12:28,556 --> 01:12:31,184
Now you come back
and change your mind.

917
01:12:31,351 --> 01:12:34,270
How reckless!

918
01:12:34,437 --> 01:12:36,272
Don't get worked up.

919
01:12:36,439 --> 01:12:39,359
-Put down the drum.
-All the women in the harem...

920
01:12:40,026 --> 01:12:42,821
...look like they've been struck
by lightning.

921
01:12:42,987 --> 01:12:45,323
But this one is good-looking.

922
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:47,617
You won't grant me this one morsel?

923
01:12:47,784 --> 01:12:50,078
-That's right.
-You bastard!

924
01:12:51,204 --> 01:12:53,415
Now that Master has made up his mind...

925
01:12:53,581 --> 01:12:58,420
...and Felicity refuses to be a concubine,
let's move towards a happy ending.

926
01:12:58,586 --> 01:13:01,256
Attendants, fetch Felicity.

927
01:13:01,423 --> 01:13:03,550
Thank you, Your Majesty.

928
01:13:03,717 --> 01:13:06,094
I don't agree to this.

929
01:13:06,511 --> 01:13:08,805
My Felicity....

930
01:13:45,925 --> 01:13:48,053
Master, drink some water.

931
01:13:49,804 --> 01:13:52,223
-You first.
-You're so kind.

932
01:13:55,018 --> 01:13:56,644
Monkey, what are you doing?

933
01:13:56,811 --> 01:13:57,979
Taking a leak!

934
01:13:58,146 --> 01:14:00,106
In front of a girl?
What's gotten into you?

935
01:14:00,273 --> 01:14:01,733
Go over there!

936
01:14:03,735 --> 01:14:05,653
-Felicity....
-Master, come with me.

937
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:07,697
-I don't need to go.
-What?

938
01:14:07,864 --> 01:14:10,408
Yes, you do! Come.

939
01:14:11,117 --> 01:14:13,828
One moment, I'll be right back.

940
01:14:14,829 --> 01:14:17,665
-My dear....
-Who are you?

941
01:14:17,999 --> 01:14:19,417
I'm Second Brother.

942
01:14:19,584 --> 01:14:22,754
Isn't my true face
completely irresistible?

943
01:14:24,422 --> 01:14:28,927
Sometimes when I look in the mirror,
my beauty stuns me.

944
01:14:29,094 --> 01:14:31,846
Second Brother,
Brother Monkey is watching you.

945
01:14:32,013 --> 01:14:34,891
You're a naughty one, aren't you?

946
01:14:37,143 --> 01:14:39,854
But I won't let you cheat me.

947
01:14:50,448 --> 01:14:52,117
Extreme!

948
01:14:52,283 --> 01:14:53,868
Mistress, go get a whip.

949
01:14:54,035 --> 01:14:55,870
Lash me, correct me...

950
01:14:56,037 --> 01:14:58,832
...insult me, beat me, punish me.

951
01:15:00,917 --> 01:15:03,211
You're laughing at me.

952
01:15:04,462 --> 01:15:07,841
You're coughing, Third Brother,
drink some water.

953
01:15:09,175 --> 01:15:11,845
What's blocking your nose?

954
01:15:26,151 --> 01:15:27,527
That's more comfortable!

955
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:30,697
So you get back human form
when you sneeze.

956
01:15:30,864 --> 01:15:34,034
You should've said so,
it's hard work pulling you.

957
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:38,496
Master, even if you don't want to pee,
try to pee just a little.

958
01:15:38,663 --> 01:15:41,041
Make a puddle to look
at your reflection.

959
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,587
I'm handsome, does that bother you?

960
01:15:45,754 --> 01:15:48,048
I've been bothered about you
for a couple of days.

961
01:15:48,214 --> 01:15:49,466
You don't even have hair.

962
01:15:49,841 --> 01:15:51,301
Felicity is quite good-looking.

963
01:15:51,468 --> 01:15:54,596
Why did she pass up being a queen
to follow you instead?

964
01:15:54,763 --> 01:15:56,473
What's on your mind?

965
01:15:56,639 --> 01:15:59,851
She's actually a demon,
she plans to eat you.

966
01:16:01,394 --> 01:16:02,562
-Don't do that!
-Sorry.

967
01:16:04,689 --> 01:16:07,692
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

968
01:16:07,859 --> 01:16:10,111
There are many kinds of demons.

969
01:16:10,278 --> 01:16:11,571
Some are easy to spot...

970
01:16:11,738 --> 01:16:15,075
...others aren't.

971
01:16:17,327 --> 01:16:19,579
So you have no proof.

972
01:16:20,038 --> 01:16:21,748
It's not hard to check.

973
01:16:21,915 --> 01:16:23,583
You've let her looks blind you.

974
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,377
Get on her case.

975
01:16:25,543 --> 01:16:27,003
Do I have to tell you how?

976
01:16:27,170 --> 01:16:30,465
Aren't you a professional demon-hunter?

977
01:16:53,613 --> 01:16:55,990
-What are you looking for?
-A mirror.

978
01:16:56,616 --> 01:16:58,410
I have one.

979
01:17:01,705 --> 01:17:03,540
It sends out light.

980
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:06,501
What a shining bronze mirror!

981
01:17:11,715 --> 01:17:13,925
-Doesn't it work?
-It's fine.

982
01:17:18,388 --> 01:17:21,057
Bad monkey, have you finished?

983
01:17:21,891 --> 01:17:24,102
Don't mind him,
I'll help comb your hair.

984
01:17:33,111 --> 01:17:34,738
Monkey, what are you doing?

985
01:17:34,904 --> 01:17:38,116
A demon's blood
will vaporise on the mirror.

986
01:17:39,951 --> 01:17:42,162
That's impossible! Nothing happened.

987
01:17:42,328 --> 01:17:44,497
-Shut it, demon-hunter!
-So she's not a demon.

988
01:17:44,664 --> 01:17:46,916
-Where are you from?
-I'm from Rivermouth Village.

989
01:17:47,083 --> 01:17:49,794
Rivermouth Village.
It's on the other side of that hill.

990
01:17:49,961 --> 01:17:51,838
I've never known a demon
with a family.

991
01:17:52,005 --> 01:17:54,966
-I dare you to take me there.
-I'll go!

992
01:17:56,718 --> 01:17:59,554
Rivermouth Village

993
01:18:03,933 --> 01:18:06,102
Felicity, it's so long
since you visited us.

994
01:18:06,269 --> 01:18:09,606
Ma, I'm following a monk west
to find sutras.

995
01:18:11,316 --> 01:18:14,277
See how nice her family is?
You'd better apologise to them now.

996
01:18:15,236 --> 01:18:18,490
Apologise? Dream on!

997
01:18:25,914 --> 01:18:27,540
Dad!

998
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:33,797
Demon girl, you hired
a big supporting cast.

999
01:18:33,963 --> 01:18:35,048
No expense spared.

1000
01:18:35,215 --> 01:18:37,592
I don't know
what the misunderstanding is...

1001
01:18:37,759 --> 01:18:39,427
...but please let my mother go.

1002
01:18:39,594 --> 01:18:41,179
Spare the lives of my family.

1003
01:18:41,346 --> 01:18:42,847
Don't be rash! Let her go.

1004
01:18:45,266 --> 01:18:48,228
Master likes this young woman,
but he still loves you too.

1005
01:18:48,395 --> 01:18:50,271
Don't be jealous.

1006
01:18:51,523 --> 01:18:52,649
Jealous?

1007
01:18:52,816 --> 01:18:55,110
Will you shut up?

1008
01:18:57,195 --> 01:18:58,697
Hurry!

1009
01:19:01,366 --> 01:19:03,243
How many times must I tell you?

1010
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:06,538
This woman is really a demon.
They're in league to do you harm.

1011
01:19:06,705 --> 01:19:10,041
They're a family, three generations!
And you keep slandering them!

1012
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:11,418
You're the one doing harm.

1013
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,503
You're the demon!

1014
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:15,880
So you believe her rather than me?

1015
01:19:16,047 --> 01:19:18,049
-Yes.
-Fine.

1016
01:19:18,216 --> 01:19:19,384
Then I'll kill her!

1017
01:19:26,057 --> 01:19:28,184
How dare you smite me as a demon?

1018
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:33,064
All the women I like, such as Miss Duan
before her, you want to kill them all?

1019
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:35,608
He finally said it.

1020
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:41,364
So you haven't forgotten.

1021
01:19:41,531 --> 01:19:43,158
Of course I remember.

1022
01:19:43,324 --> 01:19:45,910
I'll always remember.
The way you beat her.

1023
01:19:46,077 --> 01:19:47,162
Beat her to death!

1024
01:19:47,328 --> 01:19:49,414
I thought you were really treating me
as a brother.

1025
01:19:49,581 --> 01:19:50,874
Brother?

1026
01:19:51,041 --> 01:19:53,877
Since I'm stuck with a mad killer
like you, day in, day out...

1027
01:19:54,044 --> 01:19:56,880
...I have to pretend
to get along with you!

1028
01:19:57,047 --> 01:19:59,090
If you died 10 times,
it wouldn't be enough.

1029
01:19:59,257 --> 01:20:01,301
I wish you'd go to hell,
be damned forever!

1030
01:20:01,468 --> 01:20:02,552
I see.

1031
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:04,637
If you're not my friend in this world...

1032
01:20:05,138 --> 01:20:07,474
...you're my enemy.

1033
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,142
We've been enemies all along.

1034
01:20:09,851 --> 01:20:11,019
Get out!

1035
01:20:11,186 --> 01:20:13,897
Go away as far as possible,
while I'm in a good mood.

1036
01:20:14,773 --> 01:20:16,691
So you're in a good mood?

1037
01:20:17,275 --> 01:20:20,820
Listen, all of you....
All the demon-killing on this journey...

1038
01:20:20,987 --> 01:20:23,448
...I did it for him.

1039
01:20:23,907 --> 01:20:27,911
My constant headaches,
the lash scars all over my body...

1040
01:20:28,078 --> 01:20:30,497
...that's all his doing.

1041
01:20:30,663 --> 01:20:31,915
Whatever I owed him...

1042
01:20:32,082 --> 01:20:33,583
...I've repaid it in full.

1043
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:36,795
Whatever he owes me,
no need to repay.

1044
01:20:36,961 --> 01:20:39,589
From now on,
our master-disciple bond...

1045
01:20:39,756 --> 01:20:41,591
...is at an end!

1046
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:43,885
-Brother Monkey!
-Let him go.

1047
01:20:52,352 --> 01:20:54,062
Dad.

1048
01:21:17,877 --> 01:21:19,212
How's your family?

1049
01:21:19,379 --> 01:21:22,799
They're recovering, they'll be fine.

1050
01:21:23,341 --> 01:21:26,302
Please don't blame yourself.

1051
01:21:26,469 --> 01:21:28,430
Who's Miss Duan?

1052
01:21:32,183 --> 01:21:34,102
Miss Duan was also a demon-hunter.

1053
01:21:34,436 --> 01:21:36,396
<i>We faced</i>
<i>life-or-death struggles together.</i>

1054
01:21:37,647 --> 01:21:39,024
<i>I loved her a lot...</i>

1055
01:21:39,816 --> 01:21:42,193
<i>...but I dared not admit it.</i>

1056
01:21:42,527 --> 01:21:46,781
<i>Until the day</i>
<i>I saw Monkey destroying her.</i>

1057
01:21:46,948 --> 01:21:48,408
<i>And then it was too late.</i>

1058
01:21:49,159 --> 01:21:51,703
I let her down.

1059
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:54,164
And if you meet someone else you like...

1060
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:56,708
...will you let her down again?

1061
01:22:02,672 --> 01:22:06,217
I never wanted too much from life.

1062
01:22:06,551 --> 01:22:08,553
Just find the right man...

1063
01:22:09,346 --> 01:22:12,724
-...get married, have a baby....
<i>-Have a baby...</i>

1064
01:22:13,767 --> 01:22:16,269
...settle down.

1065
01:22:19,564 --> 01:22:20,940
I've found that man.

1066
01:22:21,107 --> 01:22:22,817
It's you.

1067
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:47,717
Master, it's a crisis!
Brother Monkey has gone mad.

1068
01:22:47,884 --> 01:22:50,178
He killed everyone in sight,
we couldn't stop him!

1069
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:04,609
Pigsy, Sandy,
see if anyone can be saved.

1070
01:23:04,776 --> 01:23:06,945
Ma! Dad!

1071
01:23:16,413 --> 01:23:19,124
Dad! Ma!

1072
01:23:19,290 --> 01:23:21,626
You can smile after killing so many?

1073
01:23:21,793 --> 01:23:23,378
You're possessed by the devil!

1074
01:23:23,962 --> 01:23:26,297
Those I killed were all demons.

1075
01:23:27,090 --> 01:23:29,467
You don't believe anything I say.

1076
01:23:30,051 --> 01:23:31,386
So I won't waste words.

1077
01:23:31,553 --> 01:23:33,847
I'll kill the last one...

1078
01:23:34,514 --> 01:23:36,349
...and be done with it.

1079
01:23:36,683 --> 01:23:39,978
-Don't force me!
-You'll give your life to protect a demon?

1080
01:23:40,145 --> 01:23:43,857
Yes! I won't let you hurt any more
of the people I love.

1081
01:23:44,024 --> 01:23:45,567
You're possessed. Out of my way!

1082
01:23:48,278 --> 01:23:50,530
Bad monkey, that's enough!

1083
01:23:50,697 --> 01:23:53,533
Enough? You want to die,
so be my guest.

1084
01:23:53,908 --> 01:23:56,161
<i>Child, child, why</i>

1085
01:23:56,828 --> 01:23:58,830
<i>Child, child</i>

1086
01:23:58,997 --> 01:24:00,915
<i>Why are you so bad?</i>

1087
01:24:01,291 --> 01:24:03,960
I'll sing it for you.

1088
01:24:06,546 --> 01:24:08,631
Buddha's Palm?

1089
01:24:08,798 --> 01:24:10,425
Yeah, sure!

1090
01:24:11,051 --> 01:24:14,054
Buddha's Palm? Still pretending!
You can't do it!

1091
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,895
Don't believe me, asshole?

1092
01:24:24,647 --> 01:24:27,859
No! Please don't strike your master.

1093
01:24:28,026 --> 01:24:30,612
Stop, I beg you!

1094
01:24:32,405 --> 01:24:34,407
That's very touching.

1095
01:24:34,574 --> 01:24:35,825
I'll kill you first.

1096
01:24:45,585 --> 01:24:47,629
Baldy, you're worth nothing!

1097
01:24:49,214 --> 01:24:50,632
Don't hit him!

1098
01:24:50,799 --> 01:24:54,219
I'll admit it, I'm a demon.

1099
01:24:54,552 --> 01:24:55,595
I'm a demon.

1100
01:24:55,762 --> 01:24:58,098
My real form is a skeleton.

1101
01:24:58,264 --> 01:25:00,475
I conjured up the illusion of this village.

1102
01:25:00,642 --> 01:25:02,811
You need to hear her say it again?

1103
01:25:03,311 --> 01:25:06,940
My beloved and I were waylaid
by mountain brigands.

1104
01:25:07,107 --> 01:25:10,318
My love abandoned me and fled.

1105
01:25:10,485 --> 01:25:12,987
I was horribly abused.

1106
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:16,616
The brigands raped me
and left me to die.

1107
01:25:17,450 --> 01:25:19,786
<i>I turned into a heap of bones.</i>

1108
01:25:19,953 --> 01:25:22,956
But my grievances have never died.

1109
01:25:28,253 --> 01:25:31,631
In truth, I'm nothing but bones.

1110
01:25:32,757 --> 01:25:34,592
I'm sorry.

1111
01:26:18,636 --> 01:26:20,472
Heavens! Master is dead!

1112
01:26:20,930 --> 01:26:23,141
We can forget those sutras!

1113
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:26,227
Hurray!

1114
01:26:50,627 --> 01:26:52,629
Case closed! That's great!

1115
01:26:53,463 --> 01:26:55,632
Minister...

1116
01:26:56,549 --> 01:27:00,553
...that stupid monkey is no match for us.
He's even gobbled up his master.

1117
01:27:03,098 --> 01:27:04,891
See how Buddha rages
in the western sky.

1118
01:27:05,058 --> 01:27:06,101
Shut up!

1119
01:27:08,687 --> 01:27:11,064
I have a dream.

1120
01:27:11,231 --> 01:27:16,778
I want all the world's liars and monsters
to show their true colours.

1121
01:27:17,487 --> 01:27:19,656
Felicity, no need to hide.

1122
01:27:19,823 --> 01:27:21,282
Come on, show yourself.

1123
01:27:21,449 --> 01:27:23,410
Your stratagem
of sowing discord was smart.

1124
01:27:23,910 --> 01:27:26,705
I know you have true feelings
for the monk.

1125
01:27:26,871 --> 01:27:28,707
You're following your heart...

1126
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:33,336
...my very own path
to supreme wisdom.

1127
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:38,508
So this is the legendary Monkey King?

1128
01:27:38,675 --> 01:27:40,218
Cute!

1129
01:27:40,927 --> 01:27:42,387
Like a banana? Here.

1130
01:27:50,437 --> 01:27:53,773
Fine, we can adopt him as our pet.

1131
01:27:54,149 --> 01:27:55,900
Why not! Six hands.

1132
01:27:56,067 --> 01:27:59,112
Right.

1133
01:28:01,406 --> 01:28:03,491
My turn!

1134
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,840
King of demons?

1135
01:28:19,007 --> 01:28:20,967
All I did was cough...

1136
01:28:21,134 --> 01:28:23,762
...and you were terrified.

1137
01:28:25,096 --> 01:28:26,306
I'm your new master.

1138
01:28:27,432 --> 01:28:28,808
You'd better obey me...

1139
01:28:28,975 --> 01:28:30,602
...or you'll be spanked.

1140
01:28:58,129 --> 01:29:00,215
So you're finally revealing your foxtail.

1141
01:29:00,548 --> 01:29:04,010
My tail? No, I keep it well hidden.

1142
01:29:04,594 --> 01:29:06,554
Monk...

1143
01:29:06,721 --> 01:29:08,807
...you're the one who stands exposed.

1144
01:29:08,973 --> 01:29:11,184
All that canoodling
with skeleton-demon here....

1145
01:29:11,351 --> 01:29:12,644
Worldly desires are back?

1146
01:29:13,186 --> 01:29:14,896
Felicity hasn't lost her virtues.

1147
01:29:15,063 --> 01:29:18,149
I'll make it possible for her
to reincarnate.

1148
01:29:18,316 --> 01:29:21,444
Your stratagem is to sow discord,
but we have a counter-stratagem.

1149
01:29:21,611 --> 01:29:25,115
<i>You thought we were fooled by Felicity.</i>

1150
01:29:25,281 --> 01:29:28,243
<i>You thought she could sow discord</i>
<i>between Monkey and me.</i>

1151
01:29:28,618 --> 01:29:31,621
<i>But you underestimated</i>
<i>Monkey's vision.</i>

1152
01:29:31,788 --> 01:29:34,749
<i>The skeleton-demon conjured up</i>
<i>the village...</i>

1153
01:29:34,916 --> 01:29:38,378
<i>...and we pretended to be fooled by it,</i>
<i>as you hoped.</i>

1154
01:29:38,545 --> 01:29:40,880
We tricked you into revealing yourself.

1155
01:29:41,047 --> 01:29:42,132
Minister...

1156
01:29:42,298 --> 01:29:44,259
...I'll tell you one more thing.

1157
01:29:44,426 --> 01:29:46,219
I'm actually very wise!

1158
01:29:52,434 --> 01:29:53,893
Wise?

1159
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:56,646
Comfort yourself with your illusions.

1160
01:29:58,356 --> 01:30:00,942
Let's see what you can do to me.

1161
01:30:03,194 --> 01:30:04,320
Strike!

1162
01:30:05,071 --> 01:30:06,948
All right!

1163
01:30:51,826 --> 01:30:55,080
Master, grasp my tail.

1164
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,168
Felicity!

1165
01:31:00,335 --> 01:31:03,046
Take care! Stay clear!

1166
01:31:04,381 --> 01:31:07,467
I'm the Monkey King!

1167
01:31:07,634 --> 01:31:10,095
Demon, you cannot flee!

1168
01:31:15,975 --> 01:31:18,561
Bad monkey, he's such a stupid monk.

1169
01:31:18,728 --> 01:31:20,980
Is it worth dying for him?

1170
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:24,442
Master, she says you're stupid.
She knows you too well.

1171
01:31:24,609 --> 01:31:26,861
Don't listen to her, I'm very wise.

1172
01:31:27,862 --> 01:31:29,239
You can't go far.

1173
01:31:29,406 --> 01:31:30,532
Ward me off?

1174
01:31:30,699 --> 01:31:33,034
You think you can?

1175
01:31:37,831 --> 01:31:39,332
Monkey...

1176
01:31:39,499 --> 01:31:42,293
...your nemesis is here!

1177
01:32:00,270 --> 01:32:01,521
Buddha!

1178
01:32:02,731 --> 01:32:04,774
Even Buddha is invited!
Giving you real face!

1179
01:32:17,037 --> 01:32:18,329
It's not possible.

1180
01:32:18,496 --> 01:32:19,664
It's an imposter.

1181
01:32:19,831 --> 01:32:22,500
Yep, looks like he's had
a nose and chin job.

1182
01:32:22,667 --> 01:32:23,877
Monkey...

1183
01:32:24,044 --> 01:32:26,338
...you've felt Buddha's power.

1184
01:32:26,504 --> 01:32:28,715
Come closer for the full effect!

1185
01:32:31,426 --> 01:32:34,596
Fine, try my Anchoring Pole.

1186
01:32:43,813 --> 01:32:46,900
No wave swell can match
the East Sea itself!

1187
01:33:12,717 --> 01:33:15,637
Master, shelter in my earlobe.

1188
01:33:59,639 --> 01:34:00,890
Two Buddhas!

1189
01:34:35,592 --> 01:34:37,135
Monkey. Monkey!

1190
01:35:59,426 --> 01:36:01,052
Immortal gold vulture...

1191
01:36:01,928 --> 01:36:05,724
...you have cultivated yourself
beside me...

1192
01:36:06,099 --> 01:36:08,977
...yet you do not understand.

1193
01:36:09,644 --> 01:36:13,481
No wonder you spread sophistry
in the world.

1194
01:36:15,066 --> 01:36:16,401
Lord Buddha...

1195
01:36:16,568 --> 01:36:18,319
...I live for you.

1196
01:36:18,486 --> 01:36:21,156
I've been by your side
for so many years.

1197
01:36:21,322 --> 01:36:23,158
But did you ever notice me?

1198
01:36:23,324 --> 01:36:25,285
Say no more.

1199
01:36:25,452 --> 01:36:29,581
Immortal gold vulture,
show your true self. Let go!

1200
01:37:09,162 --> 01:37:10,663
Try to stand, Felicity.

1201
01:37:11,456 --> 01:37:13,917
I will try to exorcise
your demonic traits.

1202
01:37:14,459 --> 01:37:16,211
There's too much demon in me.

1203
01:37:16,378 --> 01:37:17,879
Even if you save me...

1204
01:37:18,296 --> 01:37:20,632
...I can't be sure
I won't harm humans again.

1205
01:37:20,799 --> 01:37:22,175
You conquer demons...

1206
01:37:22,676 --> 01:37:24,052
...and I am a demon.

1207
01:37:24,678 --> 01:37:26,805
Free my soul.

1208
01:37:28,932 --> 01:37:30,183
She's right.

1209
01:37:30,725 --> 01:37:34,145
Her acrimony runs too deep,
she has to burn.

1210
01:37:37,023 --> 01:37:38,233
Felicity....

1211
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:42,112
The greatest obstacle
in the world is love.

1212
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:48,201
She is always here in your heart.

1213
01:37:48,368 --> 01:37:50,537
She fills it.

1214
01:37:50,704 --> 01:37:52,288
If only...

1215
01:37:52,455 --> 01:37:56,793
...I could remain as a trace
in your memories...

1216
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:58,336
...I'll be content.

1217
01:38:03,717 --> 01:38:04,968
Don't look at me.

1218
01:38:05,135 --> 01:38:06,845
Clean up your own mess.

1219
01:38:07,012 --> 01:38:09,889
I don't want you saying
I've killed your girl.

1220
01:38:10,348 --> 01:38:12,058
Let's go.

1221
01:38:15,645 --> 01:38:17,480
The truth is...

1222
01:38:17,939 --> 01:38:20,191
...I really have fallen for you.

1223
01:38:21,109 --> 01:38:23,945
Do you like me at least a tiny bit?

1224
01:38:26,573 --> 01:38:27,991
Sorry.

1225
01:38:28,158 --> 01:38:29,743
My heart...

1226
01:38:29,909 --> 01:38:32,162
...has no space for anyone else.

1227
01:38:33,413 --> 01:38:36,332
I'm so silly, aren't I?

1228
01:38:36,791 --> 01:38:38,251
I knew that...

1229
01:38:38,418 --> 01:38:40,253
...but I still asked.

1230
01:38:43,882 --> 01:38:45,592
Felicity...

1231
01:38:47,635 --> 01:38:49,804
...I'm going to send you on your way.

1232
01:39:45,443 --> 01:39:46,736
Don't take it so hard.

1233
01:39:46,903 --> 01:39:48,488
Master, we should talk.

1234
01:39:48,655 --> 01:39:50,907
Did you ever have feelings for Felicity?

1235
01:39:51,866 --> 01:39:56,996
I'm asking you,
did you ever have feelings for Felicity?

1236
01:39:58,498 --> 01:40:01,251
Of course not!
You're the only one in my heart.

1237
01:40:01,626 --> 01:40:02,919
Only me?

1238
01:40:03,086 --> 01:40:06,214
Brother Monkey,
your headband was once Miss Duan's.

1239
01:40:06,381 --> 01:40:09,718
The memory of her still haunts Master
so he sometimes takes you for her.

1240
01:40:09,884 --> 01:40:12,721
-You can see it in his smile, look!
-Impossible!

1241
01:40:16,016 --> 01:40:17,934
Really?

1242
01:40:18,977 --> 01:40:21,646
You don't trust even me?

1243
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:28,361
So did she ever touch your heart?

1244
01:40:29,279 --> 01:40:31,865
Of course not,
it's a meaningless question.

1245
01:40:32,032 --> 01:40:33,241
Did you really think I'd say yes?

1246
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:35,118
You women always ask
the same question.

1247
01:40:35,285 --> 01:40:37,495
So you did, you lowlife!

1248
01:40:37,662 --> 01:40:39,414
Lowlife!

1249
01:40:47,088 --> 01:40:51,426
This can't go on, I'd better get back
the headband. Or she'll ask again.

1250
01:40:52,135 --> 01:40:53,636
What are you doing?

1251
01:40:53,803 --> 01:40:56,514
-Give back the headband.
-Are you crazy? You gave it to me.

1252
01:40:56,681 --> 01:40:58,725
It doesn't suit you,
it makes you look awful.

1253
01:40:58,892 --> 01:41:00,477
You should have said so,
you can have it.

1254
01:41:00,643 --> 01:41:03,021
Hand it over! Why are you running off?

1255
01:41:03,188 --> 01:41:06,566
-I've given it to you.
-No, you just said you would.

1256
01:41:06,733 --> 01:41:10,904
-Right, I said I would.
-But you haven't done so.

1257
01:41:11,071 --> 01:41:12,822
Haven't I? Are you sure?

1258
01:41:12,989 --> 01:41:16,534
I'm sure! Believe me for once!

1259
01:48:05,318 --> 01:48:06,361
Let's go.

1260
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:08,071
Hang on, there's probably more
after the credits.

1261
01:48:08,238 --> 01:48:10,281
No need to wait,
there's no post-credits scene.

1262
01:48:10,448 --> 01:48:14,494
Be sure to take all your belongings.
Exit on the right side, thank you.

1263
01:48:14,661 --> 01:48:17,080
Hey, blockbusters always have
a post-credits scene!

1264
01:48:17,247 --> 01:48:18,665
This isn't a blockbuster...

1265
01:48:18,832 --> 01:48:21,084
...so there isn't one.

1266
01:48:21,710 --> 01:48:22,919
I repeat...

1267
01:48:23,086 --> 01:48:24,629
...it's not a blockbuster...

1268
01:48:24,796 --> 01:48:26,881
...so there isn't one.

1269
01:48:27,048 --> 01:48:29,134
If this were a blockbuster...

1270
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:31,386
...there'd be one.

1271
01:48:36,391 --> 01:48:38,393
