1
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,124
Please don't be surprised.

2
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:52,249
This is our home, Taiwan.

3
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,957
If you haven't seen it like this,

4
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,457
maybe it's because you've never been
this high above it.

5
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:22,165
Let us become a drifting cloud
or a flying bird.

6
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,374
Together, we see Taiwan.

7
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:28,290
Together, we witness the beauty
and sadness of this island.

8
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,957
Every boat loaded with a day's catch

9
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,957
is a reward for the fishermen's hard work.

10
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,374
Every field full of crops

11
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,332
is a prize for the farmers' effort.

12
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,374
Our ancestors, coming from different places,

13
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:24,915
sailed across the treacherous strait
in different times.

14
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,832
But they all had stood in the same fields,

15
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:36,165
growing rice humbly,

16
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:39,957
nurturing the crops with their sweat.

17
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,499
They worked day in and day out

18
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,374
just to grow enough food to

19
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:08,790
build their homes and support their children.

20
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:01,290
No matter where the field is.

21
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,332
No matter how old we are.

22
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:07,999
People from all walks of life

23
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:12,999
have worked as hard as they can in this land.

24
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:19,290
We not only keep ourselves going

25
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:21,832
but promise ourselves that

26
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:25,249
we will create a better future
for our next generation.

27
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:45,999
This island has been quietly nurturing us

28
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:49,165
together with other living creatures.

29
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,624
They had lived in harmony
with this land for centuries.

30
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:10,915
But who disrupted the balance
between all living creatures

31
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:13,207
and sowed the seeds of disaster?

32
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:36,457
June 2012.

33
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:39,832
We were flying along
the coast of Taitung County.

34
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:42,457
At the time, although it began to rain,

35
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:44,957
it wasn't too heavy.

36
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,832
But when the helicopter turned
towards Pingtung Plain,

37
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:58,915
it was hit by the southwest monsoon current.

38
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:04,082
Heavy rain poured down
and hit the front window hard.

39
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,999
Meanwhile,
currents started to emerge on the ground.

40
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,832
Water flooded the fish farms

41
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:14,374
as well as the fruit orchards.

42
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:36,165
During the past two decades,

43
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:39,332
on average each year,
we have 93 days of heavy rain,

44
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:41,374
42 days of very heavy rain,

45
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:44,332
and 13 days of extreme rain.

46
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,415
But during the past thirty years,

47
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:49,915
the days we have heavy rains
have clearly increased

48
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:53,040
while the days we have light rains
have clearly decreased.

49
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:54,165
In other words,

50
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,249
we either have no rain

51
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,790
or very heavy rain.

52
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,582
The total rainfall in Taiwan
hasn't changed much,

53
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:06,207
but rain falls on fewer and fewer days.

54
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:09,999
The rain concentrates to such an extent that
the land can no longer bear it.

55
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:12,415
Take Typhoon Morakot for example,

56
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:14,165
the rainfall in Mt. Ali alone

57
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:18,290
was a record-breaking 2855 mm

58
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:19,624
in just five days.

59
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:23,457
It was more than the yearly average
rainfall in Taiwan.

60
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:26,124
Before year 2000,

61
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:31,040
disasters on such a big scale happened
once every three or four years.

62
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:32,832
But in the past ten years,

63
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:34,374
we have had a super typhoon that

64
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:37,999
caused such serious floods almost every year.

65
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:14,790
Flying through layers of clouds,

66
00:30:14,791 --> 00:30:17,040
we see Mt. Dawu from above.

67
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:19,290
The scars left by Typhoon Morakot

68
00:30:19,291 --> 00:30:21,374
remain clearly visible.

69
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,415
In the past ten years,

70
00:30:27,416 --> 00:30:29,832
every time heavy rain
poured down in the mountains,

71
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:32,915
similar disasters happened.

72
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:40,332
Hundreds of tons of
mudflow and fallen rocks

73
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:42,999
remind us
how scary a natural disaster can be.

74
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,957
Taiwan is a small mountainous island.

75
00:31:38,958 --> 00:31:42,457
Mountains make up
almost three fourth of the surface.

76
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:45,999
Moreover, most of it is very steep.

77
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,999
Landslides, tremors,
and mudflows often happen.

78
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,290
Now after the 9/21 Earthquake

79
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:55,124
disasters take place even more frequently.

80
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:06,832
The driftwood washed down
from the mountains

81
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:10,415
were once the big tall trees in the forest.

82
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:14,832
Now, lying silently in a pile on the riverbank,

83
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:18,832
it looks like a jumble of
abandoned dead bodies.

84
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:29,790
Building a highway through the mountains

85
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:32,874
was once regarded as a symbol of
the iron will of mankind.

86
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:36,082
In fact,
it was the beginning of the end of the world.

87
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:41,874
Men arrogantly drew the shortest line
across the mountains and forests.

88
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:47,332
By doing that, men destroyed
the natural structure of the land.

89
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:51,999
As a result,
the road slides every time it rains.

90
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,999
In order to keep it in position,

91
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,749
containers are used as the supports.

92
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,165
Cars keep running on the road day and night

93
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:02,332
just because no one
sees the terror right below.

94
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:07,832
Most people cannot see

95
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:11,207
the injuries we inflicted on our land.

96
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:17,124
One after another,
cars go up to the mountains.

97
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:19,207
People in the cars often have no idea that

98
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:20,832
the trip is more like

99
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:25,915
an adventure than a tour.

100
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:31,374
This is Zhushan Train Station in Mt. Ali.

101
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:33,832
A popular spot for watching the sunrise.

102
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:37,207
Every day it's crowded with tourists.

103
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:39,915
But most people are unaware that

104
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:42,915
what lies right underneath their feet is

105
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:45,832
a large area of landslides.

106
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:14,124
When a disaster strikes,

107
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:17,207
even gods cannot protect themselves,

108
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:19,832
let alone humble creatures like us.

109
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:06,415
Only when we see from above,

110
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:11,332
do we realize this mountain village
is sandwiched between collapsed slopes.

111
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:13,582
It looks like a lonely island.

112
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:18,957
The roads that could be blocked at any time
are its fragile lifelines.

113
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:22,999
There are many mountain villages
like this in Taiwan.

114
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,124
People don't want to leave.

115
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:30,165
It's their wish to protect their homeland
and to stay with their ancestral spirits.

116
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:32,124
But the biggest problem is,

117
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:33,999
in fact, no one can

118
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,165
guarantee them resource and space
needed in life when they leave home.

119
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:09,999
This is a mountain in our land.

120
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,499
It was the home of broad-leaved forests.

121
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:17,207
Their deep roots held the soil
tight and keep the rainwater.

122
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,124
Nonetheless,

1123
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:21,499
they grow so slowly that it takes them decades,
even centuries to become big trees.

124
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,457
How can trees like this

125
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:26,415
compete with betel trees
that bring men tons of money every year?

126
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,874
As we now live in a time

127
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:33,040
when everything is valued by
how much profit it brings,

128
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:35,957
the trees grown in the forests for generations

129
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:39,874
have been mercilessly cut down.

130
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:43,415
What replaced them were the betel saplings
that grow money on them.

131
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:49,332
Now from above,

132
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:51,457
we see the excavator working on the ground.

133
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:56,165
It's making more space for another crop.

134
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:59,082
Tea. High mountain tea.

135
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:03,499
The trees here were mercilessly felled as well.

136
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,582
Oh, no, you can't say "mercilessly".

137
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:08,457
In a time like this, we should say,

138
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:11,082
they were felled "effectively".

139
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,290
It's the same with the cabbage fields.

140
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:16,457
Cabbage has always been grown in the plains.

141
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:18,290
Just because some gourmet said,

142
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:22,165
"The higher it's grown, the better it tastes."

143
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:25,415
People began to grow cabbage on hills

144
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:28,540
and turn forests into farmland.

145
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:08,332
What we can see is a process of

146
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:11,124
how beautiful mountains turned ugly.

147
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:15,040
But what we cannot see is even more terrifying.

148
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:18,332
When the trees
whose deep roots held soil and water

149
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:22,540
were pulled out of the ground
and replaced by crops with shallow roots,

150
00:38:22,541 --> 00:38:23,457
it was,

151
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:26,374
in fact, the beginning of a tragedy.

152
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:51,082
Roads are built higher and higher
up in the mountains.

153
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:53,832
Our footprints go deeper and deeper
into the forests.

154
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:02,040
Bungalows with corrugated iron roofs
are built in the woods.

155
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:05,290
Baths made of cement are added
next to the valleys.

156
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:08,165
Wires and water pipes not only
cut across the rivers

157
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:10,624
but divide the sky in an arrogant manner.

158
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:36,874
Tall buildings rise up in conservation areas.

159
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,999
Hot spring hotels stop the flow of rivers.

160
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,249
What is left in the valley is a narrow stream.

161
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:58,415
When it pours down with rain,

162
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:00,832
the water has nowhere to flow.

163
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:03,457
But when our lives and properties
are threatened,

164
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:08,999
we always blame Nature
instead of ourselves.

165
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:30,749
We keep building fancy castles on the hills.

166
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:34,499
We refuse to admit
the pseudo European architecture

167
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,957
doesn't go well with the surroundings.

168
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:49,999
Furthermore, we refuse to admit

169
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,082
the land cannot bear
the strong impact brought upon

170
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:55,499
by a development on such a large scale.

171
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:03,165
But until disaster strikes

172
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:06,290
luxurious B&Bs continue to be built.

173
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:09,332
All due to the unstoppable flows of tourists

174
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:13,165
as vacationing, eating vegetable
and drinking tea grown in the mountains

175
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:14,832
have become trendy things to do.

176
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:17,874
No one realizes that he himself

177
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,874
is an accomplice in causing disasters.

178
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:36,165
The forests and mountains are hurt.

179
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:39,874
Again and again, heavy rain washes
the flesh and blood from their bodies.

180
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:42,124
In the end, they dropped into the valley.

181
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:48,332
When the river flows through the valley,
the mud is deposited and becomes sediment.

182
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:49,165
Therefore,

183
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:52,915
a reservoir becomes
a deposit of mud and stones.

184
00:41:54,416 --> 00:41:58,999
Wanda Reservoir was also known as
Green Lake for its beautiful bluish green water.

185
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,415
Today the deposit of mud and rocks
in the reservoir is up to 80 million tons

186
00:42:02,416 --> 00:42:05,457
which takes up almost 70% of
the capacity of the reservoir.

187
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,874
The beautiful bluish green water
is no longer seen.

188
00:42:08,875 --> 00:42:11,915
What we see now is a pool of muddy water.

189
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:28,499
Most of the reservoirs in Taiwan

190
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,165
are facing the crisis of deposits.

191
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:35,499
Almost one third of the capacity
is eaten up by mud.

192
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:43,082
The total volume of the 17 major reservoirs in Taiwan
was 2.65 billion cubic meters.

193
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:48,332
By 2010, only 1.93 billion cubic meters was left.

194
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:54,082
The volume of deposits has already
reached 710 million cubic meters.

195
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:55,249
However,

196
00:42:55,250 --> 00:43:01,332
the volume of the deposits is increasing at
a rate of 22 million cubic meters every year.

197
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:18,124
The life expectancy of the reservoirs
is getting shorter and shorter,

198
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:21,832
so the amount of water we can keep
is getting smaller and smaller.

199
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:29,374
We fail to keep the rain that
Nature bestows on us.

200
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:33,290
We helplessly watch it flow towards the sea.

201
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:04,332
From the sky above
the southwest coast of Taiwan,

202
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:08,165
endless fish farms come into sight.

203
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:11,915
Forty thousand hectares of the surface of
the island are fish farms.

204
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:14,915
Various species of fish are farmed

205
00:44:14,916 --> 00:44:18,207
for a total value of
30.7 billion Taiwanese dollars

206
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:21,499
which makes up one third of
the whole fishing industry in Taiwan.

207
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:25,290
Fish farming needs
large quantities of clean water.

208
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:28,374
As a result, a large amount of
groundwater has to be extracted.

209
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:29,165
Hence

210
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:35,165
countless water pipes are laid across the
embankments and used to extract groundwater.

211
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:13,249
According to the statistics,

212
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,582
including the industrial use,

213
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:18,915
more than 5 billion tons of groundwater
are extracted every year.

214
00:45:19,291 --> 00:45:22,332
This is an amount far more than
the land can bear.

215
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:40,040
When the amount of groundwater
extracted exceeds the limit,

216
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:42,499
the land begins to sink.

217
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:49,832
At the moment, the land that
sinks fastest is in Yunlin County.

218
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:52,999
On average,
the land sinks more than 7 cm each year.

219
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,999
So far, the land has sunk
more than two meters deep.

220
00:45:57,291 --> 00:46:00,207
Taiwan is gradually sinking.

221
00:46:00,916 --> 00:46:02,582
In the plains on the west coast,

222
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:05,499
more than 1,000 square kilometres
of the surface has sunk below the sea level.

223
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,249
Therefore, when the seawater intrusion occurs,

224
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:12,040
the fields and houses all go underwater.

225
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:17,540
The high-water marks on the walls
are vivid records of each visit by the sea.

226
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,874
The ancestors who have long rested
underground have also fallen victim to it.

227
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:33,457
The beautiful land they chose to settle
in a century ago is flooded with salt water.

228
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:36,165
Their burial ground has turned into the sea.

229
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:42,999
The straight artificial harbours
replaced the beautiful zigzag coastline.

230
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,457
Every seven kilometres along
the west coast of Taiwan

231
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:48,540
lies an artificial harbour built of concrete.

232
00:47:50,458 --> 00:47:54,415
Abalone farms had once dominated
the northeast coast of Taiwan.

233
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:58,249
The beautiful rocky coastline
was cut and divided by concrete.

234
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,915
With profit in sight,

235
00:47:59,916 --> 00:48:04,874
no one had ever thought
the damage was irreversible.

236
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:10,040
The protruding breakwater

237
00:48:10,041 --> 00:48:14,999
causes changes in sand distribution
and results in the so-called "groin effect".

238
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:24,374
It means sand accumulates
in large quantities on the side facing the current.

239
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:29,540
On the other side, sand is lost to the sea
and this means the shore is receding.

240
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,332
As a result, we put even more tetrapods
to stop the erosion by the sea.

241
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:37,540
So more and more concrete
is accumulated at the seaside.

242
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:44,040
The artificial tetrapods replace the natural rocks
where sea creatures gather and hunt for food.

243
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:53,540
Taiwan has a coastline of 1322 km
of which 55.56% has concrete built upon it.

244
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:59,457
We built a wall
separating ourselves from the sea.

245
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:03,874
Moreover,
it stops our children getting close to the sea.

246
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:09,165
Isn't it such an irony
for an island country like Taiwan?

247
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:12,874
The sea is where life originated.

248
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:15,457
The sea is not a barrier.

249
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:18,499
It's the route from
this island to the rest of the world.

250
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:22,499
We should never see
it as a barrier or let it stop us.

251
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,457
More importantly,
we should never change its colour

252
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:26,957
or destroy its natural purity.

253
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:35,290
The wetlands are natural water purifiers.

254
00:53:35,291 --> 00:53:39,165
Toxins are depleted here
before flowing into the sea.

255
00:53:39,166 --> 00:53:42,332
Therefore they gained
the reputation as "the kidney of the Earth".

256
00:53:42,833 --> 00:53:46,207
However, due to overdevelopment
and environmental pollution,

257
00:53:46,208 --> 00:53:49,790
the wetlands are shrinking.

258
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:52,082
If we carry on what we have been doing,

259
00:53:52,083 --> 00:53:57,457
more than half of the wetlands in Taiwan
will disappear in front of our eyes.

260
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:11,249
The over-fertilized farmland,

261
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:17,457
over-use of detergents and sewage
all are causes of eutrophication.

262
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:20,332
Together with the untreated water
from factories,

263
00:54:20,333 --> 00:54:24,499
they turn clear running water
into a pool of stagnant water.

264
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:54,957
Due to untreated water from factories
and garbage pollution,

265
00:55:54,958 --> 00:55:59,165
the Guanyin Coast of Taoyuan has lost
the beautiful turquoise colour it once had.

266
00:55:59,541 --> 00:56:05,957
The polluted and pristine waters
separate from each other like Yin and Yang.

267
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:22,415
We follow the black current,
tracing it back to the estuary.

268
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:26,832
From the polluted river,

269
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:32,957
the black current of untreated water
keeps flowing into the sea.

270
00:56:57,833 --> 00:56:59,124
In Taiwan,

271
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:02,999
there are countless seriously
polluted rivers like this one.

272
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:06,207
An image like this frightens us,

273
00:57:06,208 --> 00:57:11,499
but we either feel helpless
or pretend we cannot see it.

274
00:57:13,291 --> 00:57:15,999
The untreated water not only pollutes the sea

275
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,374
but contains toxic substances.

276
00:57:18,375 --> 00:57:21,499
Once they have soaked into the soil,
it will be even more difficult to get rid of them.

277
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:25,165
However, we drink water from here

278
00:57:25,166 --> 00:57:27,874
and eat the crops grown here.

279
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:32,832
As we cannot see it,
we never feel threatened.

280
00:57:33,333 --> 00:57:38,332
We have gotten used to blaming
Nature, the Earth and the government

281
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:40,165
when things go wrong.

282
00:57:47,416 --> 00:57:50,040
These factories with corrugated iron roofs

283
00:57:50,041 --> 00:57:52,915
once contributed to Taiwan's economic miracle.

284
00:57:52,916 --> 00:57:57,915
They improved our lives
but also produced serious pollution.

285
00:58:03,166 --> 00:58:05,124
By the time we had risen above the poverty line,

286
00:58:05,125 --> 00:58:10,040
become better-off and started to pay attention,

287
00:58:10,041 --> 00:58:15,999
the water pollution was unfortunately
growing at a faster rate than we could clean it.

288
00:58:18,916 --> 00:58:21,457
Although we have
implemented environmental laws,

289
00:58:21,458 --> 00:58:27,582
there are still factories which surreptitiously
pump out untreated water at night.

290
00:58:28,166 --> 00:58:32,999
It adds a layer of black oil
to the polluted yellow water in the river.

291
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,999
All the living creatures in the river
were completely wiped out. None survived.

292
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:42,082
What is more shocking is that

293
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:45,415
such polluted water is allowed to
flow across residential areas.

294
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:49,499
So this is the environment we live in.

295
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:58,374
In the end, we could only imagine
the original colours of mountains and the sky.

296
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:09,957
This is a cement mine
on the east coast of Taiwan.

297
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:13,332
The cement industry has
huge impact on the environment.

298
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:18,915
A ton of cement
is made from 1.4 tons of limestone,

299
01:01:18,916 --> 01:01:23,249
300 kilos of clay and 60 kilos of silica sand.

300
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:26,249
In order to get these raw materials,

301
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:30,332
we cut the beautiful forests into pieces.

302
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:42,832
But we cannot see such destruction,

303
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:46,332
because we never go into the mountains.

304
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:56,499
Furthermore, mining cement
is a highly energy-consuming business.

305
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,207
To produce a ton of cement,

306
01:01:58,208 --> 01:02:03,499
you need 112.9 kWh of electricity
and 132.7 kilos of coal.

307
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:06,540
It also emits large amounts of CO2.

308
01:02:07,333 --> 01:02:09,957
But cement is needed in our lives.

309
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:12,957
Mining seems to be a necessary evil.

310
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:16,124
We produce more than
19M tons of cement every year.

311
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:19,249
Nearly half of it is exported.

312
01:02:19,791 --> 01:02:24,957
We turn our beautiful mountains and forests
into cement and sell it to others.

313
01:02:24,958 --> 01:02:28,249
Then we leave the destroyed environment
to our next generation.

314
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,332
In addition to cement,

315
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:51,249
the amount of sand and gravel mined
is even more astonishing.

316
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:54,290
More than 100 million tons of sand and gravel
is produced every year,

317
01:02:54,916 --> 01:02:58,207
of which around 60% is mined illegally.

318
01:03:03,416 --> 01:03:07,332
After this illegal mining,
a huge crater is left in the ground.

319
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:12,165
The more terrifying fact is that some
heartless businessmen will fill it with garbage,

320
01:03:12,166 --> 01:03:15,332
causing another environmental disaster.

321
01:03:26,416 --> 01:03:32,499
In fact, the amount of sand and gravel
washed down from the river is large enough.

322
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,165
There is no need to mine illegally.

323
01:03:35,166 --> 01:03:37,790
It's just because the businessmen
want to lower the cost,

324
01:03:37,791 --> 01:03:40,499
so they don't want to do it legally.

325
01:03:41,166 --> 01:03:45,499
If profit tops the priorities, who would
care about the environmental damage?

326
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:15,290
Under the banner of economic development,
industrial parks mushroomed in Taiwan.

327
01:04:15,833 --> 01:04:19,124
We see chimneys erected all over the place.

328
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:30,040
When there is no space left in the land,

329
01:04:30,041 --> 01:04:32,374
we fight against the sea for more land.

330
01:04:32,375 --> 01:04:38,332
We turn the beautiful coast into
artificial islands like those in the fantasy world.

331
01:04:48,833 --> 01:04:51,957
This is a giant chimney of 250 meters in height.

332
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:55,290
The Taichung Power Plant

333
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:56,457
Taichung Power Plant

334
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:59,957
is the largest coal-fired power station
in the world.

335
01:04:59,958 --> 01:05:00,957
Without it,

336
01:05:00,958 --> 01:05:05,165
we won't have enough electricity to meet
the industrial and domestic demands.

337
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:09,999
However,
it's also the largest CO2 emitter in the world.

338
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:20,499
In order to send electricity to every corner,

339
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:28,332
we built countless pylons
which spread across rivers and mountains.

340
01:05:35,833 --> 01:05:39,999
The power company spends lots of money
on maintaining the network

341
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,874
to ensure a steady supply of electricity.

342
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:51,790
Nevertheless, amid the green in the mountains,

343
01:05:51,791 --> 01:05:55,124
the pylons with warning signs saying
"High voltage. Keep Out."

344
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:57,540
Are hardly in harmony with the surroundings.

345
01:05:57,541 --> 01:06:04,374
But these densely built pylons
play an important role in our comfortable lives.

346
01:06:04,375 --> 01:06:05,374
Right here,

347
01:06:05,375 --> 01:06:09,124
we see the contradictory nature and conflicts

348
01:06:09,125 --> 01:06:11,999
between industrial development
and environmental protection.

349
01:06:13,166 --> 01:06:16,124
For example, we enjoy the speed and
convenience of the Taiwan High Speed Railway.

350
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:20,999
But all our daily activities are
supported by large amounts of electricity.

351
01:06:23,083 --> 01:06:26,290
We can communicate with
people in faraway places

352
01:06:26,291 --> 01:06:28,999
and build economic relations with
the rest of the world.

353
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,832
But what is hidden in the figure of
our economic growth

354
01:06:31,833 --> 01:06:35,874
is the rapidly-increasing consumption of energy.

355
01:06:59,875 --> 01:07:01,540
In recent years, the high-tech industry

356
01:07:01,541 --> 01:07:04,457
has become the main player in Taiwan's exports.

357
01:07:04,458 --> 01:07:07,249
Moreover, it's become
the symbol of Taiwan's competitiveness.

358
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:11,374
But this high-earning industry is also
a high-energy-consuming industry.

359
01:07:11,875 --> 01:07:12,957
According to the statistics,

360
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:17,457
the IT industry's need makes up 16% of
the total electricity consumption in Taiwan.

361
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:29,874
To resolve the conflicts between
energy demand and environmental protection

362
01:07:29,875 --> 01:07:34,832
is definitely not a question of
who is wrong and who is right.

363
01:07:35,125 --> 01:07:37,290
More importantly,
it's not a fight between different ideologies.

364
01:07:37,958 --> 01:07:42,082
It's a serious issue everyone
has to face rationally.

365
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:51,540
In fact,
the contradiction and conflicts we're facing

366
01:07:51,541 --> 01:07:54,874
aren't only between
energy demand and environmental protection.

367
01:07:54,875 --> 01:07:58,999
We face a similar problem
in the basic need for housing.

368
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:02,165
When the land in the plains is in shortage,

369
01:08:02,166 --> 01:08:06,249
we fight against the hills for more land.

370
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:07,040
However,

371
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:12,374
the houses always increase at
a rate faster than the revision of the regulations.

372
01:08:13,291 --> 01:08:15,999
In the old days, people said
"Houses rise from the ground".

373
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,832
Now, we say "Houses rise from the hills".

374
01:08:19,416 --> 01:08:23,165
An old nursery goes like this.

375
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:26,832
"A brook runs in front of my home.
A hill stands at the back."

376
01:08:27,333 --> 01:08:30,332
Now what lies in front of our houses
is not a brook,

377
01:08:30,333 --> 01:08:34,165
but a collapsed slope full of danger.

378
01:08:37,833 --> 01:08:43,332
What we care about a house is
how much it costs each square meter

379
01:08:43,333 --> 01:08:48,332
rather than if it will still
be safe for us to live in tomorrow.

380
01:09:11,375 --> 01:09:14,415
The contradictory nature and conflicts between
material comforts and environmental protection

381
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:18,249
have actually existed in our lives for a long time.

382
01:09:19,208 --> 01:09:22,499
We say
we want to save energy and protect the Earth

383
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,957
but produce large amounts of garbage
at the same time.

384
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,249
Maybe you've no idea that

385
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:32,124
the amount of garbage we produce in Taiwan
is one of the largest in the world.

386
01:09:32,416 --> 01:09:36,582
We have to deal with
7.4 million tons of garbage each year.

387
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:38,499
Most of the landfill sites are

388
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:42,249
situated near the sea
where no one pays attention or protests against.

389
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:15,332
On many of these sites,
the precautions aren't taken carefully,

390
01:10:15,333 --> 01:10:18,290
so when the waves lap against the shore,

391
01:10:18,291 --> 01:10:20,540
they take the garbage back to the sea.

392
01:10:20,541 --> 01:10:24,124
Drifting with the currents,
the garbage spreads along the coast.

393
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:31,332
In the past, due to a lack of funding,

394
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:33,082
some city councils buried
the garbage near the cities.

395
01:10:33,291 --> 01:10:36,040
Now they pose such a threat to public health that

396
01:10:36,041 --> 01:10:42,207
we have to spend more time and money
digging it out and treating it properly.

397
01:10:42,208 --> 01:10:46,249
But the irony is
when we're dealing with the old garbage,

398
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:49,499
we keep producing even more

399
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:54,082
as if as long as we couldn't see it,
the problem of garbage didn't exist.

400
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:58,915
This is our island, our home.

401
01:10:59,166 --> 01:11:00,415
For several generations,

402
01:11:00,416 --> 01:11:02,582
we have lived
in this land poor in natural resources

403
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:05,165
but rich in natural disasters.

404
01:11:05,166 --> 01:11:10,832
Nevertheless, we've worked so hard to
create an unprecedentedly flourishing economy.

405
01:11:11,125 --> 01:11:16,332
Meanwhile, this island has been nurturing
generations of people with her flesh and blood.

406
01:12:06,958 --> 01:12:09,207
Like a mother who has borne too many children,

407
01:12:09,208 --> 01:12:12,457
gradually,
her body is exhausted and in great pain.

408
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:18,540
But she never complains and remains silent,
offering her children whatever they ask for.

409
01:12:19,208 --> 01:12:24,832
Only when her children greedily squeeze
the last drop of milk out of her,

410
01:12:24,833 --> 01:12:27,832
can we hear her moan softly in agony.

411
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:30,332
People often say that

412
01:12:30,333 --> 01:12:33,332
if it wasn't for the wealth and happiness
of our children,

413
01:12:33,333 --> 01:12:36,332
our hard work would be meaningless.

414
01:12:36,958 --> 01:12:38,332
Sometimes I feel that

415
01:12:38,333 --> 01:12:42,207
the so-called hard work is an excuse for pillage.

416
01:12:43,333 --> 01:12:48,207
We pillage large amounts of resources
from this land to satisfy our endless desire.

417
01:12:48,208 --> 01:12:52,332
But we never thought
and probably will never admit that

418
01:12:52,333 --> 01:12:56,082
what we leave our next generation
is the aftermath of looting.

419
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:47,249
History has shown us that

420
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:50,374
the peak of a boom is often
the beginning of the decline.

421
01:13:50,916 --> 01:13:52,915
Is the same worrying crisis looming

422
01:13:52,916 --> 01:13:56,832
behind the boom we're enjoying at the moment?

423
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:58,915
Is it?

424
01:17:53,375 --> 01:17:55,999
This is Houlong Township in Miaoli County.

425
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,124
Ms. Hung Hsiang together with
her fellow villagers

426
01:17:58,125 --> 01:18:02,165
had resisted
the temptation and pressure from the outside.

427
01:18:02,166 --> 01:18:05,374
They refused to turn their land into
an industrial park.

428
01:18:06,125 --> 01:18:09,040
They insist on organic farming.

429
01:18:09,041 --> 01:18:10,249
In her fields,

430
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:13,624
weeds, insects and crops live in harmony.

431
01:18:14,208 --> 01:18:17,124
She says,
"We should have what is left by the insects".

432
01:18:17,583 --> 01:18:21,374
"What we need isn't much.
We just want too much."

433
01:18:22,416 --> 01:18:23,499
In recent years,

434
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:27,332
the number of people
who share her thoughts has been increasing.

435
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:31,290
They insist on organic
and environmentally friendly farming methods.

436
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:35,165
The proportion of their effort to their gain

437
01:18:35,166 --> 01:18:40,832
may seem laughable to people
who are used to high returns and efficiency.

438
01:18:41,166 --> 01:18:43,957
But they firmly believe that

439
01:18:43,958 --> 01:18:50,290
only when we treat our land friendly
will it treat our offspring friendly in return.

440
01:18:57,083 --> 01:18:59,832
Here comes another example.

441
01:18:59,833 --> 01:19:01,832
His name is Lai Ching-song.

442
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:07,332
He had studied in Japan and witnessed
the Japanese's attitude to their environment.

443
01:19:08,166 --> 01:19:09,540
Therefore when he returned to Taiwan,

444
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:13,457
he gave up the comfortable life
and high-earning job in the city.

445
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,207
He went back to the village in Yilan
to learn farming from scratch,

446
01:19:16,208 --> 01:19:19,499
to grow rice organically.

447
01:19:20,333 --> 01:19:27,124
Like Ms. Hung Hsiang, to grow rice in this way,
your gain is often not in proportion to your effort.

448
01:19:27,125 --> 01:19:30,165
Sometimes, you get even less than you put in.

449
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,999
As a result, he came up with an idea.

450
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,207
He set up a cooperative like a club.

451
01:19:35,583 --> 01:19:39,582
He invites people
who share his idea to join the cooperative.

452
01:19:39,583 --> 01:19:41,999
Lai is responsible for the work in the fields.

453
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,499
He and his partners share
the risks of natural disasters and others.

454
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:51,582
In return, they share the harvest.

455
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:56,499
What Hung Hsiang and Lai Ching-song
has done is an attempt.

456
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,499
But it is the beginning of something important.

457
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:04,415
Their action demonstrates a simple idea -

458
01:20:04,416 --> 01:20:06,415
for the sake of our future generations,

459
01:20:06,416 --> 01:20:11,249
we have no rights
to indulge ourselves with our endless desire.

460
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:12,332
Because

461
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:14,957
we live here only temporarily.

462
01:20:14,958 --> 01:20:17,332
We're just migrants on the Earth.

463
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:43,790
Close your eyes

464
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:52,249
Breathe in deep

465
01:21:52,916 --> 01:21:58,832
Can you see

466
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:06,124
what I see?

467
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:22,999
Keeping us in constant awe

468
01:22:23,333 --> 01:22:37,249
This feeling captured in time

469
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:44,332
Isn't there more to this?

470
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:50,165
More than what we're told

471
01:22:52,916 --> 01:22:59,332
Isn't there hope in this?

472
01:23:00,125 --> 01:23:05,582
More than this world gives

473
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:12,874
If we only realize the pain we've caused

474
01:23:12,875 --> 01:23:23,957
Know that there is still tomorrow

475
01:23:27,333 --> 01:23:36,207
Discover the light in this land

476
01:24:02,375 --> 01:24:08,290
How long more

477
01:24:10,166 --> 01:24:17,999
can we breathe?

478
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:24,499
Can you see

479
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:32,290
what I see?

480
01:24:33,166 --> 01:24:39,165
Fills us up

481
01:24:40,958 --> 01:24:47,874
Leaves us void

482
01:24:48,333 --> 01:25:02,165
Look into it and tell me

483
01:25:02,583 --> 01:25:09,332
Isn't there more to this?

484
01:25:09,333 --> 01:25:15,957
More than what we're told

485
01:25:17,833 --> 01:25:24,165
Isn't there hope in this?

486
01:25:24,833 --> 01:25:30,415
More than this world gives

487
01:25:33,208 --> 01:25:37,457
If we only realize the pain we've caused

488
01:25:37,458 --> 01:25:48,874
Know that there is still tomorrow

489
01:25:52,166 --> 01:26:02,874
Discover the light in this land

490
01:28:50,166 --> 01:28:57,124
Let us work together
to make home a better place.
