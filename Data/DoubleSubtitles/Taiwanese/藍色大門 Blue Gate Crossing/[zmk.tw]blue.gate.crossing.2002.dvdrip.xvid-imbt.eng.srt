He deceived me to hand in homework and I got it without difficulty.

 0:16:28,988 -->  0:16:30,990

149

Pick up his waster.

159
 0:17:34, 53 -->  0:17:38, 46
Am I very timid?

160
 0:17:43, 62 -->  0:17:45, 64

161
 0:17:45, 64 -->  0:17:47, 55

177
 0:21:11,270 -->  0:21:15,263
I hesitated for a long time and then wrote to you.

178
 0:21:18,277 -->  0:21:20,279
Education office is reporting.

179

301
 0:39:55,393 -->  0:39:57,395
He's so strange.

 0:39:57,395 -->  0:40: 1,388
What's going on?

303
 0:40:33,431 -->  0:40:35,433
Why did you look for me that day?

304
 0:40:35,433 -->  0:40:37,435
Nothing

305
 0:40:37,435 -->  0:40:41,439
I know who wrote "disgusting" on your desk

306
 0:40:41,439 -->  0:40:43,430
Who?

307

That one.

308
 0:41:26,484 -->  0:41:28,486
I thought you were gonna beat him.

309
 0:41:28,486 -->  0:41:30,477
Loser.

310
 0:41:31,489 -->  0:41:33,491
Do you know why he wrote that on your desk?

311
 0:41:33,491 -->  0:41:35,493
How can I know.

312
 0:41:35,493 -->  0:41:37,495
Because he likes Zhang Shihao

313
 0:41:37,495 -->  0:41:41,499
Then it should be her wrote that.

314

How are you with Zhang Shao?

315

We are just friends.

316
 0:41:45,503 -->  0:41:47,505
Then all I heard are only rumors?

317
 0:41:47,505 -->  0:41:49,507
Yeah,all rumors.

318
 0:41:49,507 -->  0:41:53,500
What rumors?

319
 0:41:54,512 -->  0:41:56,503

 0:43:28,606 -->  0:43:30,597
Zhang Shihao

325
 0:43:40,618 -->  0:43:42,609
Zhang Shihao

326

Zhang Shihao,please don't follow me after school.

327
 0:43:52,630 -->  0:43:54,632
Don't go to Dumpling Shop for dinner.

 0:43:54,632 -->  0:43:56,634
and don't come for me anymore.

329
 0:43:56,634 -->  0:43:58,625
Okay?

330
 0:44: 4,642 -->  0:44: 6,644
What do you mean by this?

331
 0:44: 6,644 -->  0:44: 9,647
It's impossible for me to like you.

332
 0:44: 9,647 -->  0:44:13,640
What's wrong with me?

333
 0:44:39,677 -->  0:44:41,679
Why did you want me to kiss you?

334
 0:44:41,679 -->  0:44:43,681
Don't you understand?

335
 0:44:43,681 -->  0:44:46,684
It's just impossible for me to like you.

336
 0:44:46,684 -->  0:44:49,687
Why did you hold my hands?

337
 0:44:49,687 -->  0:44:51,689
Why?

338
 0:44:51,689 -->  0:44:53,691
Why?  Hey?

339
 0:44:53,691 -->  0:44:55,682
No reason.

340
 0:44:56,694 -->  0:44:58,696
How is you and the P.E teacher?

341
 0:44:58,696 -->  0:45: 0,630
We have nothing.

342
 0:45: 2,700 -->  0:45: 6,693
But,but why did you want me to kiss you?

343
 0:45: 8,706 -->  0:45:10,697
Stop bugging me.

344
 0:45:14,712 -->  0:45:17,715

 0:45:55,753 -->  0:45:58,756
Tell me a secret.

354
 0:45:58,756 -->  0:45:59,757
What?

355
 0:45:59,757 -->  0:46: 3,750
Tell me a secret.

356
 0:46: 5,763 -->  0:46: 7,754
Come on.

357
 0:46: 9,767 -->  0:46:11,769
Tell me a secret.

358
 0:46:11,769 -->  0:46:13,760
A secret.

359
 0:46:16,774 -->  0:46:20,767
You really wanna know?

360
 0:46:22,780 -->  0:46:26,784
Actually I hate swimming.

361
 0:46:26,784 -->  0:46:29,787
You see my in the swimming pool everyday.

362
 0:46:29,787 -->  0:46:32,790
Actually it's boring alone in there.

363
 0:46:32,790 -->  0:46:35,793
Which sport else is for one man?

364
 0:46:35,793 -->  0:46:38,796
Many.

365
 0:46:38,796 -->  0:46:42,789
But swimming feels cool.

366
 0:46:45,803 -->  0:46:48,806
But,I want to get first place in the game,

367
 0:46:48,806 -->  0:46:51,809
and recommended to college.

368
 0:46:51,809 -->  0:46:53,811
What are you talking about?

369
 0:46:53,811 -->  0:46:55,813
I'm talking about the secret.

370
 0:46:55,813 -->  0:46:57,815
It's a mess.

371
 0:46:57,815 -->  0:46:59,817
not a secret.

372
 0:46:59,817 -->  0:47: 0,751
It's not?

373
 0:47: 0,751 -->  0:47: 2,810
It's not,think of another one.

374
 0:47: 7,825 -->  0:47: 9,827
I'm still a virgin.

375
 0:47: 9,827 -->  0:47:11,829
Many people are still virgin.

376
 0:47:11,829 -->  0:47:12,830
Who?

377
 0:47:12,830 -->  0:47:16,823
Those who say they are,think of another one.

378
 0:47:24,842 -->  0:47:26,833
I have no idea.

379
 0:47:27,845 -->  0:47:29,847
What on earth you want me to say?

380
 0:47:29,847 -->  0:47:31,838
A secret.

381
 0:47:32,850 -->  0:47:34,841
Secret.

382
 0:47:35,853 -->  0:47:37,844
Let me tell you another one.

383
 0:47:39,857 -->  0:47:41,859
I scatter.

384
 0:47:41,859 -->  0:47:43,861
What?

385
 0:47:43,861 -->  0:47:45,863
I scatter when pissing.

386
 0:47:45,863 -->  0:47:48,866
Like a sprinkler.

387
 0:47:48,866 -->  0:47:50,868
Not linear.

388
 0:47:50,868 -->  0:47:52,870
I don't know why.

389
 0:47:52,870 -->  0:47:54,872
Maybe the hole is too big.

390
 0:47:54,872 -->  0:47:58,876
Don't tell anybody.

391
 0:47:58,876 -->  0:48: 0,811
Fair.

392
 0:48: 0,811 -->  0:48: 4,872
I tell you a secret of mine too.

393
 0:48: 5,883 -->  0:48: 6,884
Where are you going?

394
 0:48: 6,884 -->  0:48: 8,886
Don't come here.

395
 0:48: 8,886 -->  0:48:10,888
Don't come here.

396
 0:48:10,888 -->  0:48:12,890
I can only tell you like this.

397
 0:48:12,890 -->  0:48:16,883
Don't come here.

398
 0:48:22,900 -->  0:48:24,902
I think Yuezhen is very nice.

399
 0:48:24,902 -->  0:48:26,904
There is no Yuezhen,isn't it?

400
 0:48:26,904 -->  0:48:30,897
There is,she likes you.

401
 0:48:34,912 -->  0:48:36,903
And?

402
 0:48:42,920 -->  0:48:46,924
I'm very kind to Yuezhen,

403
 0:48:46,924 -->  0:48:48,915
help her a lot.

404
 0:48:49,927 -->  0:48:53,931
Went to swimming pool for you with her.

405
 0:48:53,931 -->  0:48:55,933
Sent letter for her.

406
 0:48:55,933 -->  0:48:59,937
Took the consequences for her.

407
 0:48:59,937 -->  0:49: 3,930
I was always helping her.

408
 0:49: 4,942 -->  0:49: 8,935
Because I really like her.

409
 0:49:14,952 -->  0:49:18,956
So I think,I like girls.

410
 0:49:18,956 -->  0:49:22,949
It's impossible for me to like you.

411
 0:49:28,966 -->  0:49:32,959
You are a really nice person.

412
 0:49:33,971 -->  0:49:35,973
I don't wanna hurt you.

413
 0:49:35,973 -->  0:49:37,975
It's the worst excuse I've ever heard.

414
 0:49:37,975 -->  0:49:39,977
What excuse?

415
 0:49:39,977 -->  0:49:41,979
To refuse someone.

416
 0:49:41,979 -->  0:49:43,981
Next time I meet Yuezhen,

417
 0:49:43,981 -->  0:49:45,983
I'll tell her I'm gay too.

418
 0:49:45,983 -->  0:49:46,984
Belive or not,as you want.

419
 0:49:46,984 -->  0:49:48,975
I don't believe this.

420
 0:50: 1,999 -->  0:50: 4,  1
Why did you still date wih me?

421
 0:50: 4,  1 -->  0:50: 6,  3
Why did you still hold my hand?

422
 0:50: 6,  3 -->  0:50: 8,  5
Why did you still want me to kiss you?

423
 0:50: 8,  5 -->  0:50:12,  9
I always thought if i kissed a boy,

424
 0:50:12,  9 -->  0:50:14,  0
then i wasn't a lesbian.

425
 0:50:15, 12 -->  0:50:19, 16
How about you and the P.E teacher?

426
 0:50:19, 16 -->  0:50:21, 18
He just had bad luck.

427
 0:50:21, 18 -->  0:50:25, 11
I asked him if he want to kiss me too.

428
 0:50:29, 26 -->  0:50:31, 17
Yeah

429
 0:50:32, 29 -->  0:50:36, 22
Maybe,after kissed a boy,

430
 0:50:38, 35 -->  0:50:42, 28
you won't feel you are a lesbian.

431
 0:50:47, 44 -->  0:50:51, 37
Then do you want to kiss me?

432
 0:51:30, 87 -->  0:51:34, 80
Do you have feeling?

433
 0:51:40, 97 -->  0:51:44, 90
Want another kiss?

434
 0:51:47,104 -->  0:51:51, 97
Are you still a lesbian?

435
 0:51:54,111 -->  0:51:58,104
Are we done like this?

436
 0:52:12,129 -->  0:52:16,122
Are we done like this?

437
 0:52:18,135 -->  0:52:22,128
Are we done like this?

438
 0:52:24,141 -->  0:52:28,134
Are we done like this?

439
 0:52:50,167 -->  0:52:54,160
Zhang Shihao...

440
 0:52:59,176 -->  0:53: 3,169
Are you really not dating with Zhang Shihao?

441
 0:53: 4,181 -->  0:53: 6,172
I am not,really.

442
 0:53: 7,184 -->  0:53:11,177
Okay,let me show you one thing.

443
 0:53:21,198 -->  0:53:23,200
What are you doing?

444
 0:53:23,200 -->  0:53:27,193
If keep writing his name using his pen,

445
 0:53:28,205 -->  0:53:32,198
he'll love me until the ink used out

446
 0:53:33,210 -->  0:53:35,201
You are so smart.

447
 0:53:36,213 -->  0:53:40,206
The ink is almost used out.

448
 0:53:43,220 -->  0:53:47,213
You are really not dating with Zhang Shihao?

449
 0:53:49,226 -->  0:53:52,229
I've told you many times.

450
 0:53:52,229 -->  0:53:55,232
Then....introduce me to him.

451
 0:53:55,232 -->  0:53:57,234
No

452
 0:53:57,234 -->  0:53:59,236
You know him.

453
 0:53:59,236 -->  0:54: 1,171
Just introduce me to him,no big deal to you.

454
 0:54: 1,171 -->  0:54: 3,240
No.

455
 0:54: 3,240 -->  0:54: 5,242
Come on.

456
 0:54: 5,242 -->  0:54: 6,243
No.

457
 0:54: 6,243 -->  0:54:10,236
Come on,you know him....

458
 0:54:11,248 -->  0:54:13,239
Okay?

459
 0:54:16,253 -->  0:54:19,256
Will he like me?

460
 0:54:19,256 -->  0:54:21,247
No.

461
 0:54:22,259 -->  0:54:24,261
Really?

462
 0:54:24,261 -->  0:54:26,252
Yeah.

463
 0:54:44,281 -->  0:54:46,272
Zhang Shihao

464
 0:54:49,286 -->  0:54:53,290
Zhang Shihao,this is Lin Yuezhen.

465
 0:54:53,290 -->  0:54:57,283
She wants to date with you.

466
 0:55: 2,232 -->  0:55: 4,291
Come on.

467
 0:55:11,308 -->  0:55:14,311
Okay,my job is done,I've to go.

468
 0:55:14,311 -->  0:55:16,313
Wait,what should I do now?

469
 0:55:16,313 -->  0:55:18,315
What do you want to do?

470
 0:55:18,315 -->  0:55:20,306
What do you mean?

471
 0:55:21,318 -->  0:55:23,320
Okay,I wait for a while.

472
 0:55:23,320 -->  0:55:27,313
I'll call you.

473
 0:56:49,406 -->  0:56:51,408
It's here.

474
 0:56:51,408 -->  0:56:53,399
Bye.

475
 0:56:54,411 -->  0:56:57,414
Zhang Shihao.   Um?

476
 0:56:57,414 -->  0:57: 1,351
Can you date with me?

477
 0:57: 1,351 -->  0:57: 3,410
Sorry.

478
 0:57:23,440 -->  0:57:25,431
Meng Kerou

479
 0:57:26,443 -->  0:57:28,434
Meng Kerou!

480
 0:57:30,447 -->  0:57:32,449
Meng Kerou!

481
 0:57:32,449 -->  0:57:34,451
Who is there?

482
 0:57:34,451 -->  0:57:38,444
Are you looking for Meng Kerou?

483
 0:57:40,457 -->  0:57:42,448
You...

484
 0:58: 8,485 -->  0:58:10,476
Where is Yuezhen?

485
 0:58:14,491 -->  0:58:16,493
Where is Yuezhen?

486
 0:58:16,493 -->  0:58:18,495
She is cute,isn't she?

487
 0:58:18,495 -->  0:58:22,488
What do you mean?

488
 0:58:24,501 -->  0:58:26,503
What do you really mean?

489
 0:58:26,503 -->  0:58:28,505
You walked her home,didn't you?

490
 0:58:28,505 -->  0:58:31,508
What do you really mean?

491
 0:58:31,508 -->  0:58:33,510
What?

492
 0:58:33,510 -->  0:58:36,513
Boys love girls,girls love boys.

493
 0:58:36,513 -->  0:58:39,516
What else meaning?

494
 0:58:39,516 -->  0:58:42,519
What do you mean?

495
 0:58:42,519 -->  0:58:46,512
What do you mean?

496
 0:58:56,533 -->  0:58:58,524
What do you mean?

497
 0:59:16,553 -->  0:59:20,546
What do you really mean?

498
 1: 0:20,617 -->  1: 0:24,610
What do you really mean?

499
 1: 0:27,624 -->  1: 0:31,617
Don't you like Lin Yuezhen?

500
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:38,080
I can't love Lin Yuezhen.

501
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:43,080
I really can't love Lin Yuezhen.

502
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:50,080
I can't love girls.

503
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:05,120
No use. I have kissed.

504
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:13,120
Have you kissed Lin Yuezhen?

505
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,120
No.

506
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,160
Does Lin Yuezhen know?

507
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,120
No.

508
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:25,160
If I were you, I will tell her.

509
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,160
Tell her.

510
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:35,160
If I told her,we may not be able to be friends.

511
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:42,160
No everyone in this world is like you.

512
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:48,160
This world is actually not fair.

513
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,120
Sorry

514
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
For what?

515
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
If you were 17,all you think about is if you can go to college or not.

516
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
If losing virginity can make it linear when pee

517
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
What a happy kid you will be

518
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:52,200
Zhang Shihao...

519
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:34,240
That's a very luxury restaurant.

520
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,240
I've never been in there.

521
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:41,280
The light is dark,feels so romantic.

522
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,280
And there are piano playing.

523
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:47,280
And there's a kind of lavender smell floating in the air.

524
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,280
And good waiters there,in black suits,

525
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,280
Walking around

526
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,280
We were there until 9 o'clock.

527
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,280
Yuezhen.

528
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:01,200
Zhang Shao said he want to go to my house.

529
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,280
So I took him home.

530
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:07,280
He sat on my bed just after entering.

531
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,280
Yuezhen

532
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,280
What?

533
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:20,280
My mom came back after.

534
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:25,320
Yuezhen,I....

535
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:32,320
Yuezhen,I....

536
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,400
I'm a girl,I should like boys.

537
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:04,440
Hey,don't bother my friends.

538
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,440
They are not bad.

539
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:37,440
I don't know your name yet.

540
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,480
Then what kind of boys you like?

541
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:46,480
Depends on my feeling.

542
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:50,480
Then how do you feel about me.

543
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,480
I...

544
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,400
Hey...

545
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,520
Hey!Me

546
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:10,480
Um...It's nothing actually.

547
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,520
The swimming team will have a game on next Wednesday.

548
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:19,520
I hope you can come to watch it.

549
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,520
Um...and

550
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:26,520
and...and I wanna say...

551
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,560
What are you doing?

552
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,560
Don't cry.

553
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:40,560
How about we going out together,okay?

554
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,520
Come on,don't cry.

555
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:49,560
Hey!Go!Hurry!

556
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,640
Are you crazy?Come back so late.

557
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:17,680
Can I sleep beside you?

558
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,680
What's going on?

559
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,640
Nothing.

560
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,640
Come on,tell me.

561
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:31,680
When dad passed away,

562
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:35,680
How did you come through?

563
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:39,680
I've said that,you are lovelorn.

564
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:45,680
Is he the boy comes here to have dumpling everyday?

565
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,720
It's doesn't metter,everyone has been lovelorn.

566
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:54,720
How did you come through?

567
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:58,680
I don't know,just come through like this.

568
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:03,640
I don't really know.

569
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:09,720
Just come through like this.

570
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:14,720
I wish to see that day soon.

571
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:24,800
Zhang Shihao,come on!

572
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:29,800
Channel 3,Zhang Shihao from the high school attached to normal university.

573
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,800
Channel 4, Liu Ziqiang from Dong Shan School.

574
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,840
Ready!

575
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,880
1,2,3

576
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:45,920
Come on,smile
A,B

577
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,920
C

578
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:52,920
What's so funny?

579
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,920
Give us a smile.

580
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:23,960
Why didn't you come?

581
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:28,960
How did you swim?

582
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:33,960
Sucks,but it's good for you to not come.

583
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,000
I don't wanna give up.

584
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,960
The summer is almost gone,i've done nothing.

585
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Yeah,just hanging around

586
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,000
and do nothing

587
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Haven't won any game,nothing at all.

588
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
What are you thinking?

589
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,000
What are you thinking?

590
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:19,040
But at least it'll leave something.

591
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:23,040
What kind of adult we'll be depends on what it'll leave us.

592
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:27,040
Where did you steal this sentence from?

593
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,040
I'm going home.

594
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:45,040
Me too.

595
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:59,040
I win.

596
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I win again.

597
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,080
Still win.

598
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,080
I win.

599
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,080
You win.

600
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:18,080
Hey,um...actually...

601
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:24,080
That day on the phone,what I wanted to say is

602
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,120
if there was one day...

603
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:31,120
maybe after 1 year,or 3...

604
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:34,120
maybe you become to like boys.

605
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:38,120
You must tell me first

606
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,120
What the fuck are you laughing at?

607
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,120
I'm serious.

608
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:15,160
Xiao Shi,look,your colored shirt is flying away.

609
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:19,160
I'm thinking,
after 1 year,3 years,5 years

610
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:22,160
What will we become?

611
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:26,160
You are kind,unclouded and free
you'll become more handsome.

612
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:31,000
So,I seem to see after many years

613
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
You are standing at one blue gate...

614
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Sunshine of 3PM...

615
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
You have some pimples

616
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
You are smiling,I run to you to ask you if you are good.

617
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
You nod

618
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:47,000
After 3 years,5 years or maybe even longer.

619
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
What kind of adults will we become?

620
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
P.E teacher? Or my mom?

621
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Though,I can't see myself with eyes closed.

622
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:04,160
I can see you.

623
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:47,080
I'm a girl,I love boys.

624
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:02,080
Zhang Shihao was here.
