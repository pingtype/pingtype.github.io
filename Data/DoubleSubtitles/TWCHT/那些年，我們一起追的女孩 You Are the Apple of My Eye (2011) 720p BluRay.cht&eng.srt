1
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:22,167
快一點啦 今天大日子耶
Hurry up, it's a big day.

2
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:24,626
你想讓新娘子等你一個人喔
You don't want to make the bride wait for you, do you?

3
00:01:45,126 --> 00:01:46,959
老闆 一樣
The usual, boss.

4
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:51,376
錢一樣跟我媽算
Put it on my mom's tab.

5
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:52,376
好 ok 
All right, no problem

6
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:54,209
1994年
1994

7
00:01:54,334 --> 00:01:56,542
那一年 我十六歲
I was 16 that year

8
00:01:56,792 --> 00:01:58,792
張雨生的歌聲還在
Chang Yu-Sheng's voice was still heard on TV shows.

9
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:02,709
張學友的「吻別」大賣了一百多萬張卡帶
Jacky Cheung sold more than one million cassettes for the "KissGoodbye" album.

10
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:04,792
組頭還沒開始看中華職棒
The bookies hadn't started watching CPBL

11
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,709
經典的龍象大戰總是滿場
and the classic Dragon-Elephant games were always sold out.

12
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:08,792
那年
That year

13
00:02:08,917 --> 00:02:11,792
有一個皮膚黑黑的女生五度五關(張惠妹)
a girl with tanned skin won the championship on the local talent show

14
00:02:11,917 --> 00:02:13,917
贏得了五燈獎的冠軍
for five consecutive rounds.

15
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:16,126
那一年…
That year...

16
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:17,584
那些年
Those years.

17
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:21,626
我叫柯景騰
My name is Ko Ching-Teng.

18
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:23,792
同學都叫我柯騰
My friends called me Ko-Teng

19
00:02:24,376 --> 00:02:27,417
我國中念的是彰化市精誠中學
I went to Jingcheng in Changhua City for junior high school.

20
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:30,376
高中念的也是精誠中學
As for high school, I stuck to the same one, too.

21
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:35,417
這是許博淳
This is Hsu Bo-Chun.

22
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:38,584
從國中起就是我最好的朋友
He has been my best friend since junior high school.

23
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:41,292
許博淳隨時隨地都在勃起
He's always getting a boner

24
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:44,584
所以外號叫「勃起」
that's why we named him "Boner".

25
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:47,876
幹
Fuck!

26
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,001
幹三小
Fuck what?

27
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:52,334
死柯騰 別跑
You are dead meat. Don't run.

28
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:58,209
這是阿和
This is A-Ho.

29
00:02:58,334 --> 00:03:01,292
我們從國小就一直同班到高中
We have been in the same class all the way from elementary to high school.

30
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:04,001
每一個故事都有一個胖子
There is a fat guy in every story.

31
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:06,376
阿和就是那一個胖子
A-Ho is the fat guy in our story.

32
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:12,042
你們很煩耶
Stop bugging me.

33
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:14,042
剛剛好啦
Why not?

34
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:46,209
教官早
Good morning, Sir.

35
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:46,667
早
Good morning.

36
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:47,667
教官早
Good morning, Sir.

37
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:48,626

Good morning.

38
00:03:49,334 --> 00:03:50,001
教官早
Good morning, Sir.

39
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:51,667
教官早
Good morning, Sir.

40
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:52,501
早
Good morning.

41
00:03:53,084 --> 00:03:54,001
教官早
Good morning, Sir.

42
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:56,084
頭髮太長囉
Your hair is too long.

43
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:57,709
該剪的要剪一剪了
It's time to get a haircut.

44
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:06,459
你不要每天都這樣好不好
Gosh, can you stop that?

45
00:04:06,584 --> 00:04:07,459
怎樣
What?

46
00:04:07,584 --> 00:04:09,542
不要每次都從後面嚇人啊
Stop doing that

47
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:10,959
跟你講幾次了
I have told you a million times!

48
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:11,751
所以咧
Why not?

49
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,209
很浪費啊
You totally wasted my food

50
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:14,501
我熱狗只吃一口
I only had one bite of that hotdog.

51
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:15,626
所以
So...

52
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:19,084
啊你是不會接喔
Don't you know how to catch?

53
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:22,667
曹雞巴
Cock Tsao.

54
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:23,959
一大早就那麼雞巴
Why are you such a jackass in the morning.

55
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:25,917
我跟你說
You know what?

56
00:04:26,542 --> 00:04:35,584
昨天我抽到Grant Hill 1:40的限定卡
I won a Grant Hill 1 to 40 limited edition card yesterday.

57
00:04:36,584 --> 00:04:37,751
這是老曹
This is Tsao.

58
00:04:37,876 --> 00:04:41,417
老曹從國中跟我同班就是一個很雞巴的人
We have been classmates ever since junior high and he has always been an ass.

59
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:43,126
所以有時候我會叫老曹
We called him.

60
00:04:43,251 --> 00:04:48,292

{\a6}<font color=#ff5000>(Cock, Cocky, Dumbass Tsao or "Tsao motherfucker")

61
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:51,126
這麼雞巴
Show off?

62
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:56,376
不然你拿你1:100的Penny Hardaway來換
We can switch then for your 1 to 100 Penny Hardaway cards.

63
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:57,709
我才不要咧
No way!

64
00:04:58,292 --> 00:04:59,876
不要 不要還來
Piss off, then.

65
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:10,459
我這幾個好朋友唯一的共通點
The only thing that these boys shared in common with...

66
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:13,084
就是喜歡班上最乖的好學生
was that they all had a crush on the honor student in the class.

67
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:15,084
沈佳宜
Shen Chia-Yi.

68
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:17,417
在我看起來
From my point of view.

69
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:20,792
沈佳宜只是比一般的女生還要再漂亮一點點而已
Shen Chia-Yi was only slightly prettier than the other girls.

70
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:22,792
真搞不懂
Don't know what the guys were thinking.

71
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:25,459
欸 沈佳宜
Shen Chia-Yi.

72
00:05:25,584 --> 00:05:26,084
幹嘛
Yes?

73
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:28,001
妳昨天有看玫瑰之夜嗎
Did you watch Rose Night yesterday?

74
00:05:29,084 --> 00:05:31,417
妳說那個太極峽谷的那個照片啊
Are you talking about the Taichi Gorge photo?

75
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:32,709
對呀 我覺得超可怕的
Yeah, the picture was horrifying

76
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:35,084
而且我全身都起雞皮疙瘩了
I got goose bumps all over.

77
00:05:35,876 --> 00:05:37,292
那個故事聽起來很可怕
The story sounds terrifying but...

78
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:39,876
可是那張照片我看不太出來耶
I can't really tell from the picture though

79
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:42,334
我覺得只是拍攝角度的問題
I think it was the shooting angle that does the trick.

80
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:44,417
真的嗎
You think so?

81
00:05:48,584 --> 00:05:50,417
第五課跟第六課的考卷
Now, start doing the exercises for lesson five and six.

82
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:52,584
寫不完的升旗後繼續寫
Continue after the assembly if you can't finish.

83
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:53,709
自己寫自己的
Focus on your own exercises.

84
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:55,001
不可以討論
No discussion.

85
00:05:55,126 --> 00:05:56,834
這是廖英宏
This is Liao Ying-Hung.

86
00:05:57,376 --> 00:05:58,292
廖這個姓
His surname, Liao, is a verb in Chinese.

87
00:05:58,417 --> 00:05:59,334
是個動詞
And it means to scratch.

88
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:01,917
既然是個動詞
Since it's a verb

89
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:03,751
就不能白白浪費
we should make good use of this verb.

90
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:06,084
所以我們幫他取了個綽號
Thus, we gave him a nickname.

91
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:07,376
叫「廖該邊」
"Groin" (Scratching Groin)

92
00:06:09,876 --> 00:06:11,876
該邊當然也喜歡沈佳宜
"Groin" likes Shen Chia-Yi, too.

93
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:14,292
因為該邊喜歡班上每一個女生
That's because he likes every girl in the class.

94
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,084
一大清早就這麼
It's early morning and everyone looks half asleep.

95
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,959
沒 精 神
Stand straight.

96
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:00,251
還睡
Wake up!

97
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:01,292
站好
Stand straight.

98
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:11,501
還動
Stop moving.

99
00:07:21,626 --> 00:07:22,792
起立
Stand up.

100
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:26,001
立正
Attention.

101
00:07:26,126 --> 00:07:27,334
敬禮
Salute.

102
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:30,001
老師好
Good morning, Miss Chou.

103
00:07:30,126 --> 00:07:32,251
各位同學好 坐下
Good morning, everyone. Sit down.

104
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:33,667
乾隆丁亥年
In year 1974, it was still the Qing dynasty.

105
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:34,334
也就在
So it means that.

106
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:36,584
丁亥年就在我們乾隆的三十二年
It was the thirty second year that China was ruled under Emperor Qianlong.

107
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:39,292
其實高中跟國中差不了多少
There was really not that much difference between junior high and senior high.

108
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,084
地獄十七層跟十六層的差別而已
Just a matter of how deep you are in hell.

109
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:46,251
唸書 考試 整個很無聊
Endless studies, exams... it's all very boring!

110
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:49,626
有人物時間 還有再來就是地點
There is the character, the time and then it's the place.

111
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:51,584
那地點是在哪裡呢
Where is the place?

112
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:57,376
地點就在我們的上元之…
The place...

113
00:07:58,001 --> 00:08:02,001
但想辦法找一點事做就不會那麼無聊了
But, we can always find a way to entertain ourselves!

114
00:09:06,626 --> 00:09:07,709
許博淳
Hsu Bo-Chun

115
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:09,834
起來念下一段
stand up and read the next section.

116
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:14,959
站起來念啊
Stand up and read.

117
00:09:18,084 --> 00:09:19,542
上到哪一段都不知道
You don't even know where we are.

118
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:20,751
有沒有在上課啊
Hello... are you in the classroom.

119
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:22,834
柯景騰
Ko Ching-Teng

120
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:24,834
你在笑什麼
what are you laughing at?

121
00:09:25,251 --> 00:09:26,001
你念
You read it.

122
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:31,542
汝以一念之貞 遇人仳離
(Reading paragraphs from the textbook)

123
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:32,667
站起來念
Stand up and read.

124
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,209
不是很方便
It's not very convenient.

125
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:39,042
什麼叫做「不是很方便」
What do you mean "not very convenient"?

126
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:40,001
站起來
Stand up.

127
00:09:49,251 --> 00:09:50,834
上課打手槍
Jerking off.

128
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,751
上課打手槍
Jerking off right in the class

129
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:54,834
我教書教這麼多年
I have been a teacher for so many years

130
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,501
考試作弊的
I have seen students who cheat

131
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:57,667
打架的
get into fights

132
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:59,001
勒索同學的
black mail.

133
00:09:59,126 --> 00:10:01,376
甚至於想打老師的
Or even those who beat up teachers!

134
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,042
什麼壞學生我沒見過
I have seen all kinds of problematic students

135
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:06,126
我就沒見過像你們這樣變態的
but just no perverts like you!

136
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:07,667
又沒有射
I didn't even ejaculate.

137
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:08,959
你還說
And that's an excuse?

138
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:10,292
對呀
Yeah.

139
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:11,001
我們只是打好…
We were just fooling around...

140
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:12,417
你也一樣
You, too.

141
00:10:15,626 --> 00:10:18,667
你們父母花這麼多錢把你們送到學校來讀書
Your parents spent so much money to send you to school

142
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:20,834
你們不知道好好珍惜
and you guys don't even cherish how lucky you are.

143
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:23,709
什麼是打手槍啊
What's jerk off?

144
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:25,709
上課打手槍
Jerking off in the classroom.

145
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,376
喂
Hey?

146
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:31,084
我不知道耶
I don't know.

147
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:35,792
沈佳宜
Shen Chia-Yi

148
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:37,251
你出來一下
come out here for a second.

149
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:45,126
沈佳宜
Shen Chia-Yi

150
00:10:45,251 --> 00:10:47,292
柯景騰以後坐在你前面
from now on, Ko Ching-Teng will sit in front of you.

151
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:49,417
你幫老師好好管管他
Keep an eye on him for me.

152
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:51,792
千萬不要讓他把其他同學帶壞
Don't let him be a bad influence on others.

153
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,751
順便督促一下他功課
Give him a push on his schoolwork, as well.

154
00:10:53,876 --> 00:10:54,876
知不知道
Okay?

155
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:02,792
許博淳
Hsu Bo-Chun.

156
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:04,001
以後
In the future

157
00:11:04,126 --> 00:11:05,626
你坐在謝明和前面
you will sit in front of Hsieh Ming-Ho.

158
00:11:05,751 --> 00:11:06,626
一樣
The same goes for you.

159
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:08,251
不要給我作怪
Don't goof around again.

160
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,917
再作怪的話 我請你父母到學校來
If you do, I will ask your parents to come to school.

161
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:10,959
聽到沒有
Get it?

162
00:11:11,084 --> 00:11:12,001
聽到
Got it.

163
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:14,542
都上課去
Now, go to your class.

164
00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:16,876
謝謝老師
Thank you, sir.

165
00:11:26,626 --> 00:11:29,751
雖然沈佳宜國中已經跟我同班了三年
Even though Shen Chia-Yi and I have been in the same class ever since junior high

166
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:32,501
但好學生跟壞學生之間的距離
the distance between an honor student and a bad student

167
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:35,167
並沒有因此有任何的改變
always stayed the same.

168
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:39,876
換到這種鳥地方 倒霉啊倒霉啊
It's shitty luck to sit in such a shitty seat.

169
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:42,792
到底是誰倒霉啊
Who has bad luck now?

170
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:43,917
坐在我前面
You are sitting in front of me now.

171
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:45,709
你不要再搞一些幼稚的把戲
You better stop your childish pranks.

172
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:47,001
造成我的困擾
So you don't bring me unnecessary troubles.

173
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:49,667
當好學生真好
It must be nice to be an honor student.

174
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,876
只要成績好
Just because you have good marks

175
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,501
就能亂嗆人
doesn't mean you can boss people around.

176
00:11:52,626 --> 00:11:54,501
誰稀罕管你啊
Who cares about what you think?

177
00:11:55,834 --> 00:11:57,084
欸 你也不用太管他啦
Don't mind him, don't let him bother you.

178
00:11:57,209 --> 00:11:58,584
對呀
That's right.

179
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:01,167
他只是上課愛打手槍而已啦
He just likes to masturbate in the classroom.

180
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:02,751
幹
Fuck.

181
00:12:02,876 --> 00:12:06,834
你會喜歡作怪 就是因為你平常不好好唸書的關係
The reason you like to goof around is because you don't concentrate on your studies.

182
00:12:07,334 --> 00:12:08,459
對啊
Yeah.

183
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:11,792
你好強喔 你好會讀書喔
You're so clever, you are such a smart ass.

184
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:19,917
像沈佳宜這種好學生
A nerd like Shen Chia-Yi

185
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:23,417
逮到機會 就喜歡多管閒事
likes to poke her nose into other people's business whenever she gets a chance.

186
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:07,251
整天畫這種智障的東西
All you do is drawing these retarded figures every day.

187
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:08,626
沒前途啦
Where's the future in that?

188
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:09,626
要你管啊
It's none of your business

189
00:13:09,751 --> 00:13:12,459
是沒有要管啊 只是想笑一下而已呀
I'm pretty much minding my own business. I just want to have a good laugh.

190
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:15,167
沒品
Moron.

191
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:18,334
為什麼你畫的智障 每個都是光頭啊
How come every retard you drew is bald?

192
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:20,709
你是歧視光頭 還是歧視智障
Do you discriminate against bald heads or retards?

193
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,751
管好你自己就好
Mind your own business.

194
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:38,167
你烏龜喔
Man, you are as slow as a turtle!

195
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:01,084
拜拜
Bye.

196
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:13,334
柯騰
Ko-Teng.

197
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:16,167
柯騰
Ko-Teng.

198
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:17,209
啊
What?

199
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,251
你不要一直為難沈佳宜
Stop giving Shen Chia-Yi a hard time.

200
00:14:21,626 --> 00:14:22,792
媽啦
Yeah right.

201
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:26,084
就這樣
That's all.

202
00:14:27,084 --> 00:14:28,209
還這樣咧
That's all???

203
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:41,084
每個男人都想要成為最強的男人
Every man wants to be the strongest man.

204
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:42,792
我也不例外
Including me.

205
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:44,167
總有一天
One day

206
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:47,542
我一定要成為跟師父一樣強的男人
I will be as strong as my master.

207
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:51,251
你 已 經 死 了
You are D.E.A.D.

208
00:14:58,042 --> 00:15:02,709
我的個性之所以這麼豪邁 跟我的家人大有關係
The fact that I am so reckless has got something to do with my family.

209
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:05,584
媽 洗髮精沒了
Ma, shampoo is out.

210
00:15:06,584 --> 00:15:09,042
唉唷 穿衣服啦
Hey, put some clothes on.

211
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:10,834
都這麼大了
You're a grown-up now

212
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,417
真的很大吼
I know, it has grown so big, right?

213
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:22,876
我老爸在家裡 也是脫褲懶
My father also likes to walk around butt naked in the house.

214
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:27,292
今天學校有打電話來
The school called today.

215
00:15:30,542 --> 00:15:32,959
男女合校就男女合校
What's the big deal about coed school?

216
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:35,292
在學校就專心讀書
Concentrate at school.

217
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:37,542
不要搞一些有的沒的嘛
Stop goofing around.

218
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:42,001
搞什麼
What did I do?

219
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:48,584
趁熱吃 趁熱吃
Eat first, while it's still hot.

220
00:15:49,042 --> 00:15:50,876
吃完再說啦
Talk later.

221
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:58,084
你成績一直都吊車尾 是不是都不讀書
Why are your grades always in the bottom percentile?

222
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:01,417
整天只想搞一些談情說愛的事
Is it because you are thinking about girls all the time, is that why?

223
00:16:03,084 --> 00:16:04,709
我對女生沒興趣啦
No, I am not interested in girls!

224
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:10,751
我對男生也沒興趣啊
I'm not interested in guys, either.

225
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,292
說到談情說愛
Speaking of girls.

226
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:17,417
我那些好朋友
Each one of my good friend

227
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:20,751
每個人喜歡沈佳宜的方式都不一樣
liked Shen Chia-Yi in a different way.

228
00:16:23,084 --> 00:16:24,501
廖該邊 你想幹嘛
Groin, what are you doing?

229
00:16:24,626 --> 00:16:25,626
沈佳宜
Shen Chia-Yi

230
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,292
我剛剛發明了一個新魔術
I have just invented a new magic trick

231
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:28,959
第一個變給你看
I want you to be the first one to see it.

232
00:16:29,084 --> 00:16:31,001
胡家瑋你 要不要順便也看一下
Hu Chia-Wei, do you want to see it, too.

233
00:16:31,126 --> 00:16:31,876
搞笑的嗎
Is it a prank?

234
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:33,792
哪是啊 是很厲害的
No way. It's amazing.

235
00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:35,834
看清楚喔
Look closely.

236
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:38,084
該邊的方法基本上沒錯
Basically, Groin was on the right track.

237
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:39,334
就是逗女孩子開心
It's to cheer the girls up and make them laugh.

238
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:42,001
這隻手也沒有
Nothing in this hand, either.

239
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:47,001
看清楚喔
Look closely.

240
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:56,126
廖該邊 你很無聊
Groin, you are such a bore.

241
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,334
比起該邊的弱智魔術
Besides Groin's retarded magic.

242
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:02,542
老曹討女生開心的方式…
Tsao had a very different way to make girls happy.

243
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:07,751
沈佳宜
Shen Chia-Yi.

244
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:11,917
曹國勝
Tsao Kuo-Sheng.

245
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:13,376
沒人理解
And no one gets it.

246
00:17:15,376 --> 00:17:18,251
阿和很喜歡看一些大人在看的雜誌
A-Ho liked to read what grown-ups read.

247
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:21,167
對很多我不想懂的事都非常瞭解
So he knew many things that we didn't.

248
00:17:21,751 --> 00:17:22,709
沈佳宜
Shen Chia-Yi.

249
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,542
你記不記得我之前有借你一張Air Supply的專輯
Do you remember the Air Supply album that I lent you.

250
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:27,376
嗯
Um... I remember.

251
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,626
下個月他們要來開演唱會
They are coming next month.

252
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:32,084
如果我拿到票要不要一起去
Do you want to go if I have tickets?

253
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:34,042
去台北看嗎
To Taipei?

254
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:36,334
坐火車去啊
We can take the train.

255
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:38,084
胡家瑋
Hu Chia-Wei.

256
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:39,709
要不要一起去
Do you want to go with us?

257
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:40,876
好啊…
Yes, sure.

258
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:42,501
聽起來很有趣耶
Sounds fun.

259
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:46,334
用大人的方式追沈佳宜最不著痕跡
The adult's way is the most subtle way to chase after Shen Chia-Yi.

260
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,042
Air Supply是誰啊
Who is Air Supply?

261
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:56,584
有人說
Someone said.

262
00:17:56,709 --> 00:18:01,084
展現自己最笨拙的一面也是追求女孩的一種方式
Showing one's clumsy side is also another way to pursuit girls

263
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:02,126
我想
I think.

264
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:04,792
勃起充分驗證了這個方式…
Boner has tried this many times.

265
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:07,542
許博淳
Hsu Bo-Chun.

266
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:09,251
你可不可以不要再吹了啊
Can you stop playing?

267
00:18:10,251 --> 00:18:12,459
並不管用
And it proves that his way doesn't work at all.

268
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:23,751
我也有喜歡的女生
Me? Yes, there's also a girl I like.

269
00:18:23,876 --> 00:18:26,584
只是我們之間 暫時不可能
But it's unlikely that we can develop anything at that point in time.

270
00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:29,042
沒關係
That's fine

271
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:30,542
我會慢慢長大
I will grow up.

272
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:32,876
成為一個配得上她的男人
One clay, I will turn to be the man that deserves her.

273
00:18:41,626 --> 00:18:42,501
那一天
That day.

274
00:18:42,626 --> 00:18:44,542
英文老師不曉得是股票輸錢
Nobody knew if the English teacher had lost money in the stock market

275
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:46,376
還是月經亂掉
or her menstruation period went wild.

276
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,376
整張臉跟大便一樣臭
She had a shitty face.

277
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:51,251
散發出比平常更重的殺氣
She looked like she was about to kill someone.

278
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,209
起立
Stand up.

279
00:18:56,751 --> 00:18:58,251
坐下 上課
Sit down. Let's begin

280
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:03,959
原本我以為
I thought

281
00:19:04,084 --> 00:19:07,376
如果有一天能夠看到品學兼優的沈佳宜出糗
it would be great fun to see the smart ass student, Shen Chia-Yi

282
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:09,584
一定是上學最大的樂趣
makes a blunder

283
00:19:12,292 --> 00:19:13,292
我是說
I meant.

284
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:14,501
原本
"I thought."

285
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,417
沒帶課本的站起來
Stand up if you didn't bring your textbook.

286
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:28,084
柯景騰
Ko Ching-Teng

287
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,376
學期已經過了三分之一了
we have gone through a third of this semester.

288
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:32,751
每天要用的英文課本你都沒帶
And you don't even have your English textbook with you, which we use every day.

289
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:34,292
你有沒有心上課啊
Are you serious about getting an education?

290
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:35,542
椅子
Chair.

291
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:45,584
你知道私立學校的學費很貴嗎
Don't you know private schools are expensive?

292
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:47,584
連最基本的課本都不帶
If you don't even have your textbook

293
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:49,292
你來學校幹嘛
then why do you even bother coming to school?

294
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:50,709
來吃便當啊
Here to eat your lunchbox?

295
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:53,709
便當本來就要吃啊
Lunch is essential! Of course I have to eat it.

296
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,834
你還蠻會開玩笑的嘛
You think you're very funny, huh?

297
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:00,667
你到底有沒有羞恥心啊
Have you no shame?

298
00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:06,292
手舉高一點
Raise your arms higher.

299
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:08,709
再高一點
Raise them higher.

300
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,376
你是沒吃飯是不是
So weak! Didn't you eat?

301
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:15,001
出去外面跳十圈再進來
Go do 10 rounds of squat jumps outside.

302
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:18,334
我有叫你放下來嗎
Did I ask you to put your hands down?

303
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:20,876
舉高
Higher!

304
00:20:24,084 --> 00:20:26,334

I say to you today

305
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:28,126

my friends

306
00:20:28,251 --> 00:20:32,501

that in spite of the difficulties and frustrations of the moment

307
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,376

I still have a dream

308
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:39,376

that in spite of the difficulties and frustrations of the moment

309
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:41,334

I still have a dream.

310
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:49,459

It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream

311
00:20:49,584 --> 00:20:52,292

I have a dream

312
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,792

that one day this nation will rise up.

313
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:58,001
沈佳宜如果不是那麼假正經 其實還滿可愛的
(Shen Chia-Yi would be kind of cute if she wasn't such a prude)

314
00:20:58,126 --> 00:21:03,792

and live up the true meaning of its dream.

315
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:21,417
你在想什麼啊
What are you thinking?

316
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:23,292
一整天都怪怪的
You've been weird all day long.

317
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:24,959
沒有啊
Nothing.

318
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:28,792
要不要帶你去收驚啊
Do you need an exorcism?

319
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:32,376
你想太多了
You are thinking too much.

320
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,876
訓導處報告
Head office announcement

321
00:21:44,001 --> 00:21:45,626
三年二班周傑倫
Jay Chou in third year

322
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:47,042
馬上到訓導處來
please come to the head office now.

323
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:48,917
哎唷 屌哦
Sweet.

324
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:04,876
幹嘛啊
What?

325
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:07,417
昨天謝謝
Thank you for yesterday.

326
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:10,417
沒差 反正我臉皮厚
No big deal. I have no shame anyway.

327
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:15,834
謝謝
Thank you.

328
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:22,626
我看你乾脆請我喝飲料好了
Why not just buy me a drink?

329
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:25,959
不然一直聽你說謝謝 很奇怪
It's weird to hear you keep on saying "thank you".

330
00:22:28,584 --> 00:22:29,792
我可以問你一個問題嗎
Can I ask you a question?

331
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:31,209
問啊
Go ahead.

332
00:22:31,334 --> 00:22:32,667
你幹嘛不讀書
Why don't you want to study?

333
00:22:36,209 --> 00:22:37,709
沒有不讀啊
It's not like I don't want to

334
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:39,126
要是我認真唸書起來
I am afraid if I really tried

335
00:22:39,251 --> 00:22:42,292
實力強到連我自己都會害怕
I would be so good that I would even scare myself.

336
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:43,709
小心我一唸書
You better watch out then if I do study

337
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:46,334
立刻就把妳幹掉
I would beat you immediately.

338
00:22:50,209 --> 00:22:51,501
挑一下啊
Wanna take up the challenge?

339
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:53,376
怕你喔
Sure, why not.

340
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:19,917
柯景騰
Ko Ching-Teng.

341
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:30,501
幹嘛
What?

342
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:37,334
這是我自己出的考卷
This is a quiz I made up myself.

343
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:38,542
你拿回家寫
Take it and do it at home.

344
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,209
明天帶來給我改
Bring it back tomorrow.

345
00:23:43,042 --> 00:23:43,876
真的假的啦
Are you for real?

346
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:45,792
還愛心考卷
A quiz made out of love.

347
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:54,834
還有這本數學參考書
And here is a math exercise book.

348
00:23:56,959 --> 00:24:00,001
我用黃色螢光筆劃下來的地方算三遍
See the questions I've highlighted in yellow? Do them three times.

349
00:24:00,126 --> 00:24:03,042
下次小考應該就有五十分了
You will probably score at least 50% in the next quiz.

350
00:24:03,626 --> 00:24:04,709
才五十
Only 50%

351
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:08,626
我沒說考好成績很容易呀
I didn't say it's easy to get good grades

352
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:10,834
算完了基本題
I will give you some harder problems

353
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:12,709
我再出難一點的給你
after you finish the basics.

354
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:15,042
欠你錢喔
What do I owe you?

355
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:16,459
我幹嘛聽你的
Why should I listen to you?

356
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:18,834
因為我不想瞧不起你
Because I don't want to look down on you.

357
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:20,376
媽啦
Yeah right!

358
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,251
成績好就可以瞧不起人
You can be so stuck up just because you have good grades.

359
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:25,042
那你繼續好了 我又沒差
Go on then, I don't really care

360
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:28,667
我瞧不起的 不是成績不好的人
I don't look down on people with bad grades

361
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:29,542
我瞧不起的
I look down on you because

362
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:31,792
是一個明明自己不努力唸書
you pick on people with good grades

363
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:34,334
卻只會瞧不起用功唸書的人
while you don't even try to work hard.

364
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:51,417
穿衣服啦
Put on some clothes.

365
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:52,751
不然會感冒
Otherwise you'll catch a cold.

366
00:24:52,876 --> 00:24:53,751
哪有可能
That's impossible.

367
00:24:53,876 --> 00:24:55,751
我師父是李小龍耶
My master is Bruce Lee.

368
00:24:55,876 --> 00:24:57,667
吞下去再說
Swallow your food before you speak.

369
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,584
你衛生紙怎麼用那麼快啊
Why is our tissue paper running out so fast?

370
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:28,126
幹嘛
What?

371
00:25:28,251 --> 00:25:29,417
考卷
Your quiz.

372
00:25:46,459 --> 00:25:47,834
你錯很多耶
You made so many mistakes.

373
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:50,667
你回去沒看參考書就直接寫了 對不對
You did the problems without reading the exercise book, didn't you?

374
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:55,667
這兩題 你可以從參考書上找解答
You can find the answers for these two problems in the exercise book.

375
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:56,959
這一題比較難
This one is harder.

376
00:25:57,084 --> 00:25:58,917
不是背公式就可以解的
It's not the kind of problem you can solve with a formula.

377
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:01,459
需要用到這裡跟這裡的概念
You need to use these theories.

378
00:26:01,584 --> 00:26:03,626
我圈起來了 你回去自己看
You go home and read the parts I circled.

379
00:26:08,876 --> 00:26:10,376
唸書好煩
It's such a pain to study.

380
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:13,751
所以會唸書的人很厲害啊
That's why people who are good at studying rule.

381
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:21,042
你為什麼要盯柯景騰唸書啊
Why are you helping Ko Ching-Teng to study?

382
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:24,167
他成績能看嗎
Did you see his grades?

383
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,751
也不干你的事啊
It's none of your business.

384
00:26:28,626 --> 00:26:30,167
真的很爛耶
They are really bad.

385
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:33,334
那也不干你的事啊
Still, it has nothing to do with you.

386
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:40,001
來 小姐 這是你的 這是你的
Miss, this is yours and this is yours.

387
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,910
謝謝老闆
Thank you!

387
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,189
謝謝
Thank you!

388
00:26:48,876 --> 00:26:50,376
真不像你
It's so not you

389
00:26:52,251 --> 00:26:56,126
我討厭什麼都不努力 卻一點也沒有自覺的人
I hate people who are lazy and have no sense of self-awareness at all.

390
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:58,959
喔
Ok

391
00:27:01,834 --> 00:27:03,501
我又不是在說你
I'm not talking about you.

392
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:07,417
沒有在說我啊
You sure?

393
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:22,126
唸書好無聊哦
It's so boring to study

394
00:27:22,584 --> 00:27:25,084
為什麼沈佳宜可以這樣每天唸書咧
I don't understand why Shen Chia-Yi can do this every day.

395
00:27:26,751 --> 00:27:29,334
你說說看啊
Do you have any idea?

396
00:27:30,084 --> 00:27:31,292
我跟你說哦
Let me tell you.

397
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:33,126
這種尖酸的題目就算解得出來
Being able to solve these tricky math questions.

398
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,251
對人生還是一點幫助都沒有啦
Does nothing good in life!

399
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:48,292
來
Here.

400
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:52,376
怎麼那麼用功啊
Why do you work so hard?

401
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:54,751
沒有啊 隨便念
No, I just study when I feel like it.

402
00:27:55,292 --> 00:27:56,834
要念就要認真念
If you want to study, study hard then.

403
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:58,251
什麼隨便念
What do you mean "when you feel like it"?

404
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:00,251
好啦 我考慮一下
Fine, I will think about it.

405
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,042
吃稀飯
Eat porridge.

406
00:28:10,084 --> 00:28:11,834
省著點用喔
Don't finish it too quickly.

407
00:28:44,584 --> 00:28:45,542
對了
By the way

408
00:28:46,209 --> 00:28:49,917
老闆前幾天剛進一批新貨 都沒有拆
there was a new shipment in the store a few days ago. The whole package was unopened

409
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:52,042
可是他要整盒賣
so the store owner wants to sell the whole thing together.

410
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:56,501
所以你們覺得要買整盒的SKYBOX 還是兩盒CC啊
Do you think I should buy the whole package of SKYBOX or two boxes of CC?

411
00:28:56,626 --> 00:28:58,334
SKYBOX太貴了
SKYBOX is too expensive.

412
00:29:00,292 --> 00:29:02,042
所以兩盒CC囉
So, two boxes of CC?

413
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:03,709
你昨天是打幾次啊
How many times did you jerk off yesterday?

414
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:05,167
這麼想睡哦
Why are you so tired?

415
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:08,417
打你的頭啦
Jerk off your ass.

416
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:11,459
你自己頭自己打 不要打我的啦
Mind your own business.

417
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:12,751
幹
Fuck!

418
00:29:14,126 --> 00:29:15,042
起來吃肉圓啦
Get up and eat your meatballs.

419
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:16,876
你不吃 我把你吃掉喔
If you don't eat it, I'm going to finish yours, too.

420
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:21,834
沈佳宜 你看 新魔術
Shen Chia-Yi, check out my new magic.

421
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:31,959
你白癡耶
You idiot.

422
00:29:32,084 --> 00:29:33,209
該邊 還不錯喔
Not bad!

423
00:29:33,334 --> 00:29:34,209
太噁了啦
Gross!

424
00:29:34,334 --> 00:29:35,709
他今年變過最好的
It's the best this year.

425
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:37,042
今年最好的對不對
Isn't it?

426
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:39,334
你們在幹嘛
What are you guys doing?

427
00:29:39,459 --> 00:29:40,084
新魔術啦
It's a new magic.

428
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:40,959
真的假的 我要看我要看
For real? Show me! Show me!

429
00:29:41,084 --> 00:29:42,001
我變一次給你看
I will show you.

430
00:29:42,126 --> 00:29:42,959
超噁的
It's gross.

431
00:29:50,292 --> 00:29:52,417
就假裝有喝 其實沒有
Just pretend that you are drinking, but don't swallow it.

432
00:29:59,334 --> 00:29:59,709
你很遜耶
You suck.

433
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:01,417
你好噁喔你
You are so gross.

434
00:30:05,334 --> 00:30:06,167
訂正
Make correction

435
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:07,417
十分鐘
10 minutes.

436
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:09,626
依我的聰明才智
Because I am so damn smart

437
00:30:09,751 --> 00:30:11,667
五分鐘就綽綽有餘了
5 minutes is more than enough.

438
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:25,626
要念出來念啦
Don't study in the toilet

439
00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:27,542
恁母啊 我尿快要閃出來了啦
I am going to pee in my pants.

440
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:29,626
媽 你不要嚇我啦
Ma, stop scaring me.

441
00:30:29,751 --> 00:30:31,292
我嚇你幹嘛啦
Why would I?

442
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:33,292
棒棒咧緊出來
Dump it out and come out.

443
00:30:38,126 --> 00:30:39,417
快啦
Hurry up.

444
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:51,042
這晚還不睏
Why are you up so late?

445
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:52,417
咧衝三小啊
What the hell are you doing in there?

446
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:54,542
在念英文啦
I am studying English

447
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:56,376
英文以後用不到啦
English is useless for you

448
00:30:56,876 --> 00:30:58,751

I FUCK YOU

449
00:30:58,876 --> 00:31:00,334
好睏啊啦
Go to sleep

450
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:06,417

I sleep late because I study English very hard.

451
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:10,251
謝明和
Hsieh Ming-Ho

453
00:31:14,001 --> 00:31:15,376
好 不錯不錯
Not bad, not bad.

454
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:16,876
繼續努力
Keep it up

455
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:21,584
張家琪

四十四分
44%

457
00:31:24,209 --> 00:31:26,001
家琪要加油喔
Work harder.

458
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:28,334
柯景騰
Ko Ching-Teng

459
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:29,876
七十五分
75%

460
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:36,209
最近有比較用功喔
You have been studying hard lately?

461
00:31:36,334 --> 00:31:37,667
沒有啦 天才
Not really, I am a genius.

462
00:31:38,209 --> 00:31:40,042
那都要這樣天才喔
Then, be a genius from now on.

463
00:31:41,292 --> 00:31:42,959
好啦 下課
Okay, Class dismiss.

464
00:31:44,084 --> 00:31:46,376
記住 下禮拜還要考試哦
Remember the test next week.

465
00:31:46,501 --> 00:31:47,626
還天才啊
Genius?

466
00:31:47,751 --> 00:31:48,751
真敢講耶
Are you serious?

467
00:31:50,751 --> 00:31:54,709
其實會解這種題目有什麼了不起的
It's not a big deal that you know how to solve these problems

468
00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:55,876
我敢跟妳賭
I bet you

469
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:58,876
十年後我連Log是什麼都不知道
in 10 years time, I wouldn't even know what log is

470
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:00,876
還是可以活得好好的
and it makes no difference to my life.

471
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:01,667
嗯
Emmmm...

472
00:32:03,292 --> 00:32:04,292
妳不相信
You don't believe me?

473
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:05,667
我相信啊
I do.

474
00:32:05,792 --> 00:32:07,751
相信妳還那麼用功讀書
Then, why do you still work so hard?

475
00:32:08,751 --> 00:32:11,376
人生本來就有很多事是徒勞無功的啊
You don't expect returns from everything you do.

476
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:15,542
妳真的很喜歡學大人講道理耶
You really like to pitch high notes like adults, don't you?

477
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:21,376
像你這麼幼稚 對你的人生一點幫助也沒有
It will be no help to your life whatsoever if you continue to be so childish like this.

478
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:23,334
妳又沒做過
How would you know

479
00:32:23,459 --> 00:32:24,959
妳怎麼知道
if you've never been childish ever?

480
00:32:25,084 --> 00:32:28,001
很多事不用做就知道沒有意義啊
You know something is meaningless without trying it.

481
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:41,501
爛斃了
This is shit.

482
00:32:42,167 --> 00:32:43,292
來 下一隊
Next group

483
00:32:51,626 --> 00:32:54,084
聽說被殭屍咬到也會變殭屍
I heard you will become a zombie if you are bitten by one

484
00:32:56,501 --> 00:32:58,126
我不相信這件事
I don't buy that.

485
00:32:58,251 --> 00:33:00,251
這件事一定是假的啊
This must be some rumors.

486
00:33:00,376 --> 00:33:02,084
可是我覺得一定是有個依據 他才會講
But he had to learn this from somewhere, right?

487
00:33:02,209 --> 00:33:03,292
怎麼辦
What are we going to do?

488
00:33:05,626 --> 00:33:06,376
喂
Hey.

489
00:33:11,417 --> 00:33:12,376
幹嘛
What?

490
00:33:12,917 --> 00:33:15,876
你有沒有聽到 大家最近都在聊的傳說啊
Have you heard that rumor lately?

491
00:33:16,001 --> 00:33:18,834
我很帥這件事已經變傳說囉
You mean the one that every girl wants to date me?

492
00:33:19,542 --> 00:33:20,542
白癡
Moron.

493
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:22,334
好啦 幹嘛
Okay, what is it?

494
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:27,376
聽說有一批大陸偷渡客 偷渡到一半就淹死了
I heard some stowaways from China were drowned.

495
00:33:27,501 --> 00:33:28,959
屍體被衝上岸後
And they had became zombies

496
00:33:29,084 --> 00:33:30,542
都變成殭屍了耶
after their bodies were washed up on shore.

497
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:34,251
喔 你說那群殭屍喔
Oh! Those zombies

498
00:33:34,376 --> 00:33:35,501
我知道啊
I've heard about them.

499
00:33:36,001 --> 00:33:41,001
他們就沿路一直跳一直跳一直跳
They jumped, jumped and jumped all the way here.

500
00:33:41,876 --> 00:33:42,626
媽啦
Shit.

501
00:33:42,751 --> 00:33:43,709
那是真的嗎
Are you for real?

502
00:33:44,209 --> 00:33:45,001
廢話
Of course.

503
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:47,792
一堆人晚上不睡覺 在山上跳跳跳
With whole bunch of people jumping around up in the hills at night

504
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:49,167
不是殭屍是什麼
what do you think they are?

505
00:33:51,042 --> 00:33:54,084
我記得前幾天報紙也有寫吧
Yes, I remember seeing that on the newspaper a few days ago.

506
00:33:54,876 --> 00:33:57,417
如果他們努力一點的話
If they jumped harder

507
00:33:57,542 --> 00:33:59,667
現在應該已經跳到八卦山了
they should have reached Baguashan Mountain by now.

508
00:34:21,501 --> 00:34:23,834
怎樣 要去看嗎
So, do you want to see them?

509
00:34:24,376 --> 00:34:25,917
誰要去看啊
No way

510
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:30,584
可是就算是真的 要看也看不到吧
I don't think you can see them even if they are real.

511
00:34:30,917 --> 00:34:34,459
說不定他們在八卦山上迷了路
Maybe they got lost in Baguashan Mountain

512
00:34:35,376 --> 00:34:37,501
就直接跳進彰化市區了啊
and jumped directly into Changhua city.

513
00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:40,209
別說不可能
Don't think it's impossible.

514
00:34:40,334 --> 00:34:42,376
殭屍又沒有方向感
Zombies don't have a sense of direction.

515
00:35:01,542 --> 00:35:02,126
幹嘛
What?

516
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:05,626
你最近跟沈佳宜好像很有話聊
You and Shen Chia-Yi seem to have a lot to talk about lately.

517
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:07,042
幫我一個忙
Do me a favor.

518
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:08,376
該不會是
No way.

519
00:35:08,501 --> 00:35:10,376
寫情書這種爛梗吧
Don't tell me you want to write a love letter?

520
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:12,042
你寫好
You write it

521
00:35:12,459 --> 00:35:13,751
我照抄
and I copy it

522
00:35:13,876 --> 00:35:16,709
可是一瓶飲料好像不夠耶
I don't think one drink is enough

523
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:18,417
幫我告白成功的話
if she says yes

524
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:19,876
我請你一年份
I will buy you one year worth.

525
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:24,834
加一張Grant Hill 100:1明星賽球員卡
Plus a Grant Hill 100:1 All-Star Card.

526
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:28,501
好 一言為定
Alright, deal.

527
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:53,751
柯景騰
Ko Ching-Teng.

528
00:35:53,876 --> 00:35:55,501
你晚上有沒有要補習
Are you going to cram school tonight?

529
00:35:55,917 --> 00:35:57,626
補個屁呀
What for?

530
00:35:57,751 --> 00:35:59,667
你這麼笨 還不補習
You are so dumb, how can you not go!

531
00:36:03,626 --> 00:36:04,834
你管我
Mind your own business.

532
00:36:06,709 --> 00:36:07,917
今天晚上開始
Starting tonight

533
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:09,376
你留在學校唸書
you stay here and study after school.

534
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,709
晚上留校
Stay at school?

535
00:36:12,459 --> 00:36:14,584
有沒有搞錯啊
What's your problem?

536
00:36:14,709 --> 00:36:16,209
我也會留啊
I will stay, too.

537
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:18,959
哪招啊
What the hell?

538
00:36:25,376 --> 00:36:27,417
原來沈佳宜只要沒有補習
It turned out that Shen Chia-Yi stayed behind to study

539
00:36:27,542 --> 00:36:29,834
都會一個人留在學校唸書
when she didn't have to go to cram school.

540
00:36:38,042 --> 00:36:42,667
欸 你是不是怕那群偷渡上岸的殭屍跳到這裡
So, you asked me to stay behind at school with you

541
00:36:42,792 --> 00:36:44,084
才叫我陪你啊
only because you are afraid of those zombies, right?

542
00:36:44,792 --> 00:36:46,667
我是怕你笨
I am just worried you're getting stupid.

543
00:36:56,167 --> 00:36:57,334
對了
Right.

544
00:36:57,876 --> 00:37:01,042
這裡有封信 是老曹叫我拿給你的
Tsao asked me to give you this letter.

545
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:13,042
我親愛的沈佳宜同學
My dear Shen Chia-Yi

546
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:14,292
我很喜歡你
I like you very much.

547
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:18,167
俗話說：Nothing's gonna change my love for you
As the song goes, "Nothing's gonna change my love for you.

548
00:37:18,292 --> 00:37:20,709

Making love out of nothing at all

549
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:24,126
勉強可以表達我對你的感覺
barely expresses my feelings for you.

550
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:27,001
這是你的字耶
This is your handwriting.

551
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:32,126
柯景騰
Ko Ching-Teng

552
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:33,584
我不得不說耶
I must say

553
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:36,751
你寫情書的文筆 真的很差耶
you suck at writing love letters.

554
00:37:36,876 --> 00:37:37,876
哪可能
What do you mean?

555
00:37:38,001 --> 00:37:40,334
明明就寫得氣勢非凡好不好
I am that close to William Shakespeare, okay?

556
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,042
有時間幫人家寫情書啊
Since you have the time to write love letters for someone else.

557
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:45,834
不如用這些時間拿去背單字
Why don't you use the time to memorize some English vocabulary?

558
00:37:54,626 --> 00:37:55,584
說真的
Ok.

559
00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:59,792
雖然我很帥 人聰明 又會講笑話
Even though I am cute, smart and incredibly humorous

560
00:38:00,376 --> 00:38:02,417
但妳不要輕易的喜歡上我
don't fall in love with me easily.

561
00:38:03,042 --> 00:38:07,251
因為我是孤獨的 風中一匹狼
Because I am a lone wolf traveling in the wild wind.

562
00:38:07,376 --> 00:38:08,542
謝謝喔
Oh, thanks

563
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:10,417
我又不喜歡比我笨的男生
I'm not interested in guys who are dumber than me.

564
00:38:10,626 --> 00:38:12,709
沈佳宜不喜歡比她笨的男生
Shen Chia-Yi doesn't like guys that are dumber than her.

565
00:38:13,084 --> 00:38:13,876
笨
Dumb?

566
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:16,584
我是怕搶了妳全校第一名的頭銜
Come on, I let you win on purpose

567
00:38:16,709 --> 00:38:18,626
才一直忍妳 讓妳
I don't study hard cause I don't want to beat you

568
00:38:18,751 --> 00:38:20,084
故意輸給妳 好不好
and I don't want to hurt your feelings!

569
00:38:21,251 --> 00:38:22,542
這怎麼好意思啊
Pardon me.

570
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,792
拜託你不用這麼忍耐
Save your kindness, mister. You are welcome to try to beat me anytime!

571
00:38:26,709 --> 00:38:28,834
敢不敢 跟我打一個賭
I dare you to bet with me.

572
00:38:32,292 --> 00:38:33,376
賭
Let's bet on...

573
00:38:33,501 --> 00:38:34,834
頭髮
Your hair.

574
00:38:36,084 --> 00:38:36,834
怎麼賭
How?

575
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:39,751
如果妳月考考贏我的話
If you beat me in the next midterm

576
00:38:39,876 --> 00:38:41,542
妳要怎麼整我都可以
you can do whatever you want to me.

577
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:43,292
但如果我考贏妳的話
But, if I won

578
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:46,709
妳要綁一個月的馬尾
you will have to wear a ponytail for a month.

579
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:49,376
隨便啊
Sure, whatever.

580
00:38:49,501 --> 00:38:51,501
反正又不可能
It's not like you would win anyway!

581
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:55,667
這種超雞巴的自信 我又被電到了
I was struck by her cocky confidence right away.

582
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:29,584
喂
Hey, you.

583
00:39:29,709 --> 00:39:30,584
三更半夜不睡覺
Why on earth you need to study freaking English

584
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:32,751
背什麼死人骨頭英文
in the middle of the night?

585
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:45,459

I fuck you

586
00:39:46,126 --> 00:39:47,334

I fuck you too

587
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:50,709

I fuck your mother.

588
00:39:55,709 --> 00:39:57,084
你幹嘛 幹嘛啦
What's wrong with you?

589
00:40:07,042 --> 00:40:08,084

Fuck you fuck you

590
00:40:08,209 --> 00:40:09,876

I love you

591
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:11,584

I LOVE YOU

592
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:16,376
老闆
Hey, Ma'am.

593
00:41:16,501 --> 00:41:18,334
來碗超帥的光頭
A super hot and charming jar head, please.

594
00:41:18,751 --> 00:41:20,792
三八啦 光頭哪有帥的
Idiot, how can a jar head be handsome?

595
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:22,001
有啦
Of course there is.

596
00:41:22,126 --> 00:41:23,626
不信你剪剪看
Give it a try if you don't believe me.

597
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:43,542
不欠你啦
Here, I don't owe you any more.

598
00:41:58,709 --> 00:41:59,917
不要弄啦
Stop that.

599
00:42:00,042 --> 00:42:01,917
我在補習班聽說
Rumor has it that Inoue Takehiko has died a couple weeks ago!

600
00:42:02,042 --> 00:42:05,876
井上雄彥啊 前幾個禮拜出車禍死了
I heard that he died in a car accident.

601
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:06,917
是喔
Really.

602
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:10,792
難怪我感覺他畫風有點變
No wonder I felt something was different in his drawing style.

603
00:42:11,876 --> 00:42:16,834
突然變強而已 這種天才怎麼可能說死就死啊
More powerful that is, how can such a genius die just like that.

604
00:42:51,584 --> 00:42:52,751
你覺不覺得
Don't you think...

605
00:42:52,876 --> 00:42:54,042
覺得怎樣
Think What?

606
00:42:54,876 --> 00:42:58,042
你覺不覺得沈佳宜有點喜歡我
Don't you think Shen Chia-Yi likes me?

607
00:42:58,376 --> 00:43:00,834
不然今天怎麼綁馬尾
If not, why would she wear a ponytail today?

608
00:43:01,626 --> 00:43:02,542
也許喔
Maybe!

609
00:43:03,501 --> 00:43:07,126
沈佳宜怎麼知道我喜歡綁馬尾的女生啊
How did Shen Chia-Yi know I like girls who wear ponytails?

610
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:08,667
是嗎
You too?

611
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:11,501
我一直一直都很喜歡綁馬尾的女生啊
I always like girls who wear ponytails.

612
00:43:11,917 --> 00:43:12,792
我也是
So do!

613
00:43:13,459 --> 00:43:16,709
我不知道沈佳宜為什麼贏了還要綁馬尾
I don't know why Shen Chia-Yi wore a ponytail that day even though she won the bet.

614
00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:18,542
但從此以後
However, ever since then

615
00:43:18,667 --> 00:43:22,626
努力用功讀書竟然變成一件非常熱血的事
studying hard had become an enthusiastic thing for me.

616
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:37,959
幾千塊錢的班費 不見了
The class funds went missing.

617
00:43:39,709 --> 00:43:43,584
第六節課的時候 班長檢查還在
It was still here when the class leader checked about an hour ago.

618
00:43:44,334 --> 00:43:46,167
現在要放學了
Now school is almost finished.

619
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:52,501
偷錢的人 還會有誰
Who else could have stolen that money?

620
00:43:53,292 --> 00:43:55,751
一定是你們班上自己的同學
It must be someone sitting in this classroom!

621
00:43:59,084 --> 00:44:02,251
把錢偷走的再不自首的話
Whoever stole that money, you better turn yourself in right now.

622
00:44:02,917 --> 00:44:05,584
就不要怪教官不客氣
Otherwise, don't blame me for being too harsh afterwards.

623
00:44:14,917 --> 00:44:15,501
好
Fine.

624
00:44:18,584 --> 00:44:20,667
不敢承認也沒有關係
It's okay if no one wants to admit it

625
00:44:22,501 --> 00:44:25,792
反正這個小偷 就在你們這個班上
I guarantee that the thief is sitting right here in this room.

626
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:29,042
他一定覺得自己很聰明
The person must thinks that he can get away with this.

627
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:31,334
好
Good

628
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:34,667
很好
very good.

629
00:44:35,709 --> 00:44:38,417
現在每一個人把紙筆拿出來
Now, take out your pen, everyone.

630
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:42,292
寫下你認為可能是小偷的人的名字
And write down the name of the person that you think it's most likely to be the thief.

631
00:44:43,709 --> 00:44:45,667
投票結果前三名
The top three named

632
00:44:45,792 --> 00:44:49,334
把書包倒在講台上 讓我檢查
will have to bring your bags forward, and I will check them personally.

633
00:44:53,501 --> 00:44:54,834
立刻
Now!

634
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:57,209
馬上把隨堂測驗紙拿出來
Take out your paper right now.

635
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:04,167
曹國勝
Tsao Kuo-Sheng.

636
00:45:04,292 --> 00:45:05,667
你幹什麼
What are you doing?

637
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:07,042
教官
Sir.

638
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:09,001
你憑什麼叫我們懷疑自己的同學
Who do you think you are to have us suspect our own classmates?

639
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:12,167
我是教官 還是你是教官
Now who is the supervisor? Are you or am I?

640
00:45:15,542 --> 00:45:16,376
你是教官
You are, sir.

641
00:45:16,501 --> 00:45:17,792
但你是個爛人啦
But you are an ass hole!

642
00:45:18,417 --> 00:45:19,292
你說什麼
What did you say?

643
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:20,959
我說你爛人
I said you are an asshole.

644
00:45:22,209 --> 00:45:24,417
柯景騰 曹國勝
Ko Ching-Teng, Tsao Kuo-Sheng

645
00:45:24,542 --> 00:45:27,292
我看你們兩個是做賊心虛
I think you guys are bluffing

646
00:45:28,042 --> 00:45:31,834
把你們的書包給我拿過來 第一個檢查
bring your bags now and I will check yours first.

647
00:45:32,626 --> 00:45:33,542
報告教官
Excuse me, Sir.

648
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:34,834
你不可以這樣
You have no right to do that

649
00:45:36,251 --> 00:45:37,834
不可以怎麼樣
I have no right to do what?

650
00:45:38,667 --> 00:45:40,542
不可以叫我們投這種票
You can't ask us to write down names and vote on such a thing.

651
00:45:40,667 --> 00:45:42,542
不可以叫我們懷疑自己的同學
You can't ask us to suspect our own classmates.

652
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:44,959
大不了大家再把錢繳一次就好了
We can just all pay the fees again.

653
00:45:45,084 --> 00:45:46,626
這也沒什麼
It's no big deal.

654
00:45:46,751 --> 00:45:47,584
對啊
Exactly.

655
00:45:47,709 --> 00:45:48,834
再繳一次就好了嘛
We can just pay again.

656
00:45:48,959 --> 00:45:53,126
妳不要以為你成績好 說什麼都沒有關係
Being an honor student doesn't mean that you can say whatever you want.

657
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:55,167
把你的書包拿過來
Bring your bag over here.

658
00:45:55,667 --> 00:45:56,667
我們不要
No way.

659
00:45:57,001 --> 00:45:58,459
我們又不是小偷
We are not thieves.

660
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:02,376
爛人
Douche.

661
00:46:03,167 --> 00:46:04,042
你說什麼
What did you say?

662
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:05,459
爛人啦
I said you are a douchebag.

663
00:46:07,084 --> 00:46:09,084
統統把書包給我拿過來
Bring your bags over now, all of you.

664
00:46:10,459 --> 00:46:11,251
不要
No.

665
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:18,084
教官
Sir

666
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:20,626
我現在合理的懷疑你沒有小雞雞
I now suspect that you have no balls.

667
00:46:20,751 --> 00:46:21,792
褲子脫下
Take your pants off now.

668
00:46:22,209 --> 00:46:22,959
你說什麼
What did you say?

669
00:46:23,084 --> 00:46:23,917
褲子脫下啦
Take your pants off.

670
00:46:24,042 --> 00:46:25,626
把書包拿過來
Bring your bags over.

671
00:46:26,792 --> 00:46:28,126
要就給你啦
Fine, here you go!

672
00:46:40,792 --> 00:46:42,584
你們不要一直看我
Stop staring at me.

673
00:46:42,709 --> 00:46:44,334
我覺得很丟臉
It's very embarrassing. I feel so ashamed.

674
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:46,876
一點都不丟臉啊
There is nothing to be ashamed of.

675
00:46:47,001 --> 00:46:48,126
妳超厲害的耶
You kicked ass!

676
00:46:49,251 --> 00:46:51,126
半蹲不用太認真啦
Don't need to be too serious about this.

677
00:46:51,251 --> 00:46:52,376
沈佳宜
Shen Chia-Yi.

678
00:46:53,084 --> 00:46:54,209
稍微休息一下
Relax a bit.

679
00:46:55,792 --> 00:46:57,542
蹲個意思意思就好了啊
Just pretend, it's no big deal.

680
00:46:57,667 --> 00:47:00,417
反正那些老師根本沒在看
Those teachers are not watching anyway.

681
00:47:01,626 --> 00:47:04,251
偶爾當一下壞學生 很爽的
It's kind of nice to be a bad student once in a while, isn't it?

682
00:47:05,376 --> 00:47:06,584
好丟臉
I am so ashamed.

683
00:47:08,626 --> 00:47:11,001
認識妳從國中到現在
Ever since I knew you from junior high

684
00:47:12,001 --> 00:47:14,292
剛剛是我唯一覺得妳比我厲害的時候
that was the only time I was amazed by how tough you really are.

685
00:47:15,209 --> 00:47:17,542
沈佳宜 妳超正點的耶
Shen Chia-Yi, you rock!

686
00:47:17,917 --> 00:47:19,542
哭起來也超正的
You look so pretty even when you cry.

687
00:47:20,001 --> 00:47:20,751
對啊
Yeah.

688
00:47:21,501 --> 00:47:22,709
超正的
Super duper cool.

689
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:26,209
令人刮目相看
Unbelievably cool.

690
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:38,376
不像考卷 所有複雜困難的問題都能得到一個解答
Unlike quizzes

691
00:47:39,042 --> 00:47:42,084
真實人生裡有些事永遠也沒有答案
you never find a correct answer in life.

692
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:46,209
到底是誰偷了班費 沒有人知道
No one really knew who stole our money, but no one really cared.

693
00:47:46,959 --> 00:47:50,334
只記得 那天的沈佳宜真的
All I remembered from that day was Shen Chia-Yi's face

694
00:47:50,459 --> 00:47:53,167
好美 好美
beautifully and delicately engraved in my heart.

695
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:14,959
六年前 剛剛踏進精誠中學國中部的時候
Six years ago, when we first stepped in to Jing-Cheng high school

696
00:48:15,334 --> 00:48:18,501
十二歲的我們懵懵懂懂
we were all young and immature.

697
00:48:19,251 --> 00:48:22,417
雖然對於未來有無限的想像
Although we had great dreams about our future

698
00:48:22,542 --> 00:48:27,334
卻不知道能在這裡學習到什麼 收穫到什麼
we weren't really sure what we were going to learn and encounter during these years.

699
00:48:28,501 --> 00:48:32,001
幸好一路上有師長的諄諄教誨
Thanks to the teachers who led us and furnished us with abundant knowledge.

700
00:48:32,126 --> 00:48:35,084
同學們也建立了深厚的情誼
Thanks to all the peers who accompanied us throughout the years

701
00:48:35,626 --> 00:48:39,959
一起經歷困難挫折 也一起攜手成長
with bitter and sweet memories.

702
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:45,251
我說 精誠中學就是我們的青春
Ching-Chen high school represents our young and crazy days

703
00:48:45,376 --> 00:48:47,626
也是最美好的行囊
it gave us the most wonderful times of our life.

704
00:48:48,251 --> 00:48:49,251
畢業典禮後
From now on

705
00:48:49,376 --> 00:48:54,292
讓我們用力的張開翅膀 飛向各自不同的夢想
it's time for us to spread our wings and chase our dreams.

706
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:56,292
各位同學
So long, my friends.

707
00:48:57,084 --> 00:49:00,667
我們珍重再見
So long, my friends.

708
00:49:49,126 --> 00:49:50,292
真羨慕妳
How I envy you.

709
00:49:50,417 --> 00:49:53,751
國中三年 高中三年 都有這麼多人追妳
You have so many guys chasing after you throughout the years!

710
00:49:55,626 --> 00:49:58,084
被喜歡其實是很不錯
Yes, it's quite nice to be liked by someone.

711
00:49:58,917 --> 00:50:00,167
但是
But...

712
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:06,292
妳該不會想說被這麼多人追 其實很困擾吧
Don't tell me that you feel annoyed because you are too popular.

713
00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:07,542
不是啦
No

714
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:13,959
我只是覺得 自己是個很幸福的人
I just think that I am a very lucky girl.

715
00:50:15,292 --> 00:50:18,209
那妳決定好了嗎
So, have you decided?

716
00:50:18,709 --> 00:50:19,917
決定什麼
Decided what?

717
00:50:20,042 --> 00:50:23,251
決定跟誰在一起啊
Decided whom you want to be with.

718
00:50:26,876 --> 00:50:29,292
幹嘛啊 連我都不能說喔
Come on, you can't even tell me?

719
00:50:33,751 --> 00:50:34,334
如果…
Ok, if...

720
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:38,501
…我會很高興的
I will be really happy.

721
00:50:48,459 --> 00:50:50,917
畢業快樂
Happy graduation.

722
00:50:58,167 --> 00:51:00,334
終於 聯考了
Finally, the colleague entrance exam came.

723
00:51:01,209 --> 00:51:04,417
對我來說 聯考好像不是去考大學
To me, the exam was more like a test for Shen Chia-Yi's special training programs

724
00:51:04,542 --> 00:51:07,417
而是驗收沈佳宜對我的特訓成果
rather than an exam for college.

725
00:51:34,751 --> 00:51:40,626
升大學前 最後一個夏天的主題 是咸咸的海水
We spent most of our time at the beach during the summer before college.

726
00:52:21,959 --> 00:52:22,834
真的很幼稚
They are so childish

727
00:52:22,959 --> 00:52:24,459
超幼稚的
I know, so childish.

728
00:52:27,126 --> 00:52:28,876
你應該不太喜歡幼稚的男生吧
You don't really like childish guys, do you?

729
00:52:29,001 --> 00:52:29,834
嗯
No.

730
00:52:31,459 --> 00:52:33,584
那你覺得裡面誰最幼稚
Who do you think is the most childish one among them all.

731
00:52:35,042 --> 00:52:36,501
柯騰吧
Ko-Teng, maybe?

732
00:52:41,459 --> 00:52:42,501
那我呢
How about me?

733
00:52:46,626 --> 00:52:48,876
你很幼稚耶
You are so childish.

734
00:53:12,626 --> 00:53:13,876
畢業了耶
Now that we have graduated

735
00:53:14,001 --> 00:53:16,084
你們有沒有想過以後要幹嘛
have you thought about what you want to do in the future?

736
00:53:19,542 --> 00:53:21,709
我想去科學園區上班
I want to work in the Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park

737
00:53:21,834 --> 00:53:24,167
分股票 賺大錢
so I can get stocks for bonuses and tons of money.

738
00:53:24,292 --> 00:53:25,626
然後娶沈佳宜
And then I can marry Shen Chia-Yi...

739
00:53:25,751 --> 00:53:26,626
或胡家瑋
or Hu Chia-Wei.

740
00:53:26,751 --> 00:53:28,459
誰要嫁給你啊
Who wants to marry you?

741
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,792
我想出國唸書耶
I want to study abroad.

742
00:53:36,001 --> 00:53:37,709
你出國很浪費錢啦
It'll be such a waste of money, okay?

743
00:53:37,834 --> 00:53:39,292
你靠腰哦
Oh, fuck off.

744
00:53:43,709 --> 00:53:44,959
出國唸書
Study abroad?

745
00:53:45,084 --> 00:53:46,667
我也想出國唸書
I want to study abroad, too.

746
00:53:47,042 --> 00:53:50,167
去申請公費留學 念MBA
Maybe I will apply for government scholarships and get an MBA degree

747
00:53:53,751 --> 00:53:57,709
我想一直打籃球下去 打進校隊
I want to keep on playing basketball.

748
00:53:57,834 --> 00:54:01,042
最後打進美國職籃
And maybe one day make my way to NBA.

749
00:54:04,542 --> 00:54:05,376
家瑋呢
What about you, Chia-Wei?

750
00:54:07,876 --> 00:54:09,167
我啊
Me?

751
00:54:09,292 --> 00:54:11,376
找個有錢人嫁掉就好啦
I think I will find myself a rich man to marry.

752
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:13,667
干你屁事
Go away.

753
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,459
沈佳宜咧
What about you, Shen Chia-Yi?

754
00:54:18,292 --> 00:54:21,667
我對自己的未來 其實沒有太多想像
I don't expect much about my future, really.

755
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:32,417
還有一個人還沒說耶
Ko-Teng, it's your turn

756
00:54:35,251 --> 00:54:37,084
我想成為一個很厲害的人
I want to be a kickass person.

757
00:54:39,834 --> 00:54:42,376
你這有說跟沒說根本一樣嘛
What are you talking about?

758
00:54:42,501 --> 00:54:44,376
怎樣才是厲害的人啊
What is a kickass person?

759
00:54:46,792 --> 00:54:52,376
讓這個世界因為有了我 而有一點點的不一樣
I want the world to be a little bit better because of me.

760
00:54:59,084 --> 00:55:03,417
而我的世界 不過就是妳的心
And you are the only person that is going to make my world better.

761
00:55:17,084 --> 00:55:18,584
喂 幹嘛
Hello. Yes?

762
00:55:57,209 --> 00:55:59,042
我只會唸書
I am a nerd

763
00:56:00,417 --> 00:56:02,334
我只會唸書
I am a bookworm.

764
00:56:05,001 --> 00:56:08,126
從國中到高中
Ever since junior high and high school.

765
00:56:08,251 --> 00:56:10,292
我就只會唸書
All I did was studying

766
00:56:13,292 --> 00:56:15,167
卻還是考不好
I still screwed it up.

767
00:57:12,501 --> 00:57:14,126
不管妳念哪間學校
No matter which university you go to

768
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:18,501
有件事 我想跟妳說
there is something that I want to say to you.

769
00:57:20,917 --> 00:57:21,292
拜託你
Please.

770
00:57:21,417 --> 00:57:23,959
不要現在跟我講你喜歡我
Don't tell me you like me now

771
00:57:26,292 --> 00:57:27,751
我喜歡妳
I do like you

772
00:57:28,126 --> 00:57:29,834
妳早就知道了啊
and you knew that already.

773
00:57:30,917 --> 00:57:33,626
那你要跟我說什麼啦
What do you want to tell me, then?

774
00:58:20,209 --> 00:58:22,001
聯考放榜了
The results were out.

775
00:58:23,084 --> 00:58:25,084
阿和考上了清大經濟
A-Ho got into Economics Major in National Tsing Hua University

776
00:58:25,209 --> 00:58:27,834
朝未來出國留學的路邁進
which means he made one step forward to his overseas dream.

777
00:58:29,209 --> 00:58:31,251
該邊考上了逢甲資工
Groin got into Information Engineering at Feng Chia University

778
00:58:31,376 --> 00:58:34,042
也算是踏上了科學園區之路
to become one of those Science Park smart engineers.

779
00:58:40,251 --> 00:58:43,501
老曹呢 考上了成大化工
Tsao got into Chemical Engineering at Cheng Kung University.

780
00:58:43,626 --> 00:58:47,626
看樣子以後要去美國職籃是有一點難度
So I guess it's most unlikely that he would make it into NBA.

781
00:58:48,709 --> 00:58:50,209
沈佳宜雖然失常
Although Shen Chia-Yi didn't do as well as she expected

782
00:58:50,334 --> 00:58:52,667
但還是考上了師範學院
she still got into University of Education

783
00:58:52,792 --> 00:58:57,376
想到將來沈佳宜當老師的樣子 就覺得非常適合她
I could totally imagine Shen Chia-Yi being a teacher, it really suits her.

784
00:59:04,334 --> 00:59:05,167
送你
Here, for you.

785
00:59:08,542 --> 00:59:09,626
這什麼
What is this?

786
00:59:10,709 --> 00:59:12,042
我自己畫的
I drew it myself.

787
00:59:12,667 --> 00:59:13,667
有點醜
Not my best work

788
00:59:14,709 --> 00:59:16,292
不過還可以
but I think it's okay.

789
00:59:21,834 --> 00:59:22,834
謝謝囉
Thanks.

790
00:59:34,959 --> 00:59:38,917
沈佳宜 上大學以後
Shen Chia-Yi, promise me something.

791
00:59:39,834 --> 00:59:42,626
不要太快讓別的男生追到妳
Don't let boys get you too soon after you go to college.

792
00:59:43,959 --> 00:59:44,792
好不好
Ok?

793
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:48,251
你在說什麼啊
What are you talking about?

794
01:00:34,459 --> 01:00:36,584
<font color=#ffa500>(你是我最珍貴的人）
You Are the Apple of My Eye.

795
01:00:44,751 --> 01:00:46,876
喔 對了 還有勃起
Oh, yes, as for the masturbating Boner.

796
01:00:47,084 --> 01:00:49,751
一直打手槍的勃起 重考
He decided to stay and take the college entrance exam again.

797
01:00:50,084 --> 01:00:56,251
重考 重考 陪我重考啦
Take the entrance exam next year with me please!

798
01:00:59,626 --> 01:01:01,834
我也來到人生的下一站
I have also come to the next stage in my life

799
01:01:03,251 --> 01:01:05,542
一間沒有沈佳宜的大學
a school without Shen Chia-Yi

800
01:01:10,126 --> 01:01:14,292
沒想到我第一個牽手的女孩 不是沈佳宜
I never thought that Shen Chia-Yi would not be the first girl that I hold hands with.

801
01:01:14,792 --> 01:01:17,584
而是 而是一個叫
Instead of her, it was a girl named...

802
01:01:17,709 --> 01:01:18,584
叫什麼
Named...

803
01:01:18,709 --> 01:01:20,501
你好 我叫許可欣
Hello, my name was Hsu Ke-Shin.

804
01:01:21,126 --> 01:01:23,167
你好 我叫柯景騰
Hi, my name is Ko Ching-Teng.

805
01:01:29,376 --> 01:01:31,626
宿舍有很多奇奇怪怪的傳說
There were many weird stories in the dormitory.

806
01:01:31,751 --> 01:01:33,542
大部分都跟鬼有關
Most of them were ghost stories.

807
01:01:33,667 --> 01:01:34,251
不過
But

808
01:01:34,376 --> 01:01:37,251
其中有一個跟四腳獸有關的傳說
there's one story about a four-legged beast.

809
01:01:37,376 --> 01:01:39,167
絕對是真的
It was definitely real...

810
01:01:49,542 --> 01:01:52,251
我的室友來自四面八方
My roommates came from all walks of life.

811
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:57,459
孝綸是個肌肉狂 整天舉啞鈴
Hsiao-Lun was a muscle maniac, who did nothing but lifted weights all day long.

812
01:02:03,251 --> 01:02:04,417
超級宅的義智
The ultimate weirdo is Yi-Chi.

813
01:02:04,542 --> 01:02:07,667
隨時都在看動漫 幾乎不去上課
He was never in the classroom because he's always reading Manga.

814
01:02:12,667 --> 01:02:15,709
從大一就開始準備考研究所的建漢
Chien-Han, who started to prepare for graduate school from the day he arrived

815
01:02:15,834 --> 01:02:17,834
無時無刻都在唸書
was studying twenty four seven.

816
01:02:18,709 --> 01:02:21,876
幸好 我們還有共通的話題
Luckily, we had some common interests to talk about.

817
01:02:24,292 --> 01:02:27,501
是不是 飯島愛太老了
See, Iijima Ai is way too old.

818
01:02:27,626 --> 01:02:29,167
奶頭都黑掉了
Her tits have turned dark.

819
01:02:30,251 --> 01:02:32,376
小澤圓看起來比較可口
Emmm... Madoza Ozawa looks hotter and yummier

820
01:02:32,501 --> 01:02:34,126
大浦安娜也不錯
Anna Ohura is not too bad, either

821
01:02:35,167 --> 01:02:39,001
我那邊有個叫人類補奸計劃的好東西
I have some nice stuff called the Human Sex Program.

822
01:02:39,126 --> 01:02:41,001
等一下一起看啊
Let's watch it together later.

823
01:02:41,417 --> 01:02:44,459
看卡通人物做愛 也太奇怪了吧
Don't you think it's too weird to watch cartoon characters having sex?

824
01:02:45,459 --> 01:02:47,959
還有跟狗 還有跟鰻魚的咧
There're ones with dogs and eels, too.

825
01:02:51,709 --> 01:02:54,334
那是手機還沒普及的年代
That was the time before mobile phones were common.

826
01:02:54,459 --> 01:02:57,834
到了晚上一堆男生就像集體中邪一樣
At night, all the guys acted like they casted a spell.

827
01:02:57,959 --> 01:03:00,459
在公共電話前大排長龍
Everyone one of us was lining up in front the telephone booth

828
01:03:02,876 --> 01:03:07,626
小可愛 我好想你喔
I miss you so much my sweetie little pumpkin pie

829
01:03:09,459 --> 01:03:13,917
每個小時都固定想你十次啊
I miss you 10 times every hour on a regular basis.

830
01:03:15,334 --> 01:03:16,876
真的啊
It's true.

831
01:03:17,876 --> 01:03:20,251
那你有沒有好想我
So do you miss me this much, too?

832
01:03:22,792 --> 01:03:25,251
一個小時想幾次
How many times per hour?

833
01:03:27,251 --> 01:03:29,584
有沒有十次
10 times at least?

834
01:03:34,751 --> 01:03:35,959
喂
Hey.

835
01:03:36,084 --> 01:03:38,376
喂 你還沒睡吧
You are not asleep yet, are you?

836
01:03:39,459 --> 01:03:40,167
還沒啊
No, not yet.

837
01:03:40,292 --> 01:03:41,251
快睡啦
Go to sleep

838
01:03:41,376 --> 01:03:44,001
每天晚上我都跟沈佳宜講電話
I talked to Shen Chia-Yi every night.

839
01:03:44,626 --> 01:03:46,792
有時講到她睡著
Sometimes, she fell asleep in the middle of our conversations.

840
01:03:46,917 --> 01:03:49,792
有時講到我連吃飯的錢都用光光
Sometimes I spent all my money on phone calls and left no money for food.

841
01:03:49,917 --> 01:03:52,126
迎新晚會下禮拜啊
Welcome party? Next week.

842
01:03:52,251 --> 01:03:53,501
下禮拜
Next week.

843
01:03:54,126 --> 01:03:56,667
那我跟妳說喔
Listen.

844
01:03:57,167 --> 01:04:00,209
妳可不可以不要下去跳舞
Can you please not dance with anyone?

845
01:04:00,917 --> 01:04:03,042
不要下去跳舞 為什麼
Why not?

846
01:04:03,709 --> 01:04:05,251
因為
Because...

847
01:04:05,376 --> 01:04:08,876
雖然我還沒追到妳啊
Ok, I know we are not seeing each other yet.

848
01:04:09,001 --> 01:04:12,042
不過那些追都沒追過妳的男生
But those guys who you don't even know.

849
01:04:12,167 --> 01:04:13,751
怎麼可以牽妳的手
Can you not let them hold your hands?

850
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:16,167
我自己都沒牽過耶
I haven't even held them myself.

851
01:04:16,709 --> 01:04:17,709
那你呢
What about you?

852
01:04:17,834 --> 01:04:19,042
你沒下去跳啊
You didn't dance with anyone?

853
01:04:19,542 --> 01:04:22,001
我就不相信你沒有牽其他女生的手
I don't believe you didn't hold any girl's hands.

854
01:04:23,376 --> 01:04:26,209
是有稍微牽一下啦
Oh, well... yeah, but only a little bit.

855
01:04:27,209 --> 01:04:28,709
不過那是因為
That's because...

856
01:04:29,209 --> 01:04:31,376
我把對方想成妳啊
I imagined that she was you.

857
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:33,667
你少噁心了 我才不相信咧
Oh please, I don't believe you.

858
01:04:33,792 --> 01:04:34,376
真的啦
Really.

859
01:04:34,501 --> 01:04:36,334
那我也可以把對方想成是你啊
Then I can also imagine the guy I dance with was you.

860
01:04:36,626 --> 01:04:37,501
不要鬧啦
No man, I'm for real.

861
01:04:37,626 --> 01:04:39,376
好啦 說真的喔
All right, I am serious.

862
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:41,167
不可以被牽喔
Don't let anyone hold your hands.

863
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:43,834
嗯 掰掰
Bye.

864
01:04:48,626 --> 01:04:52,292
終於上大學後的第一個聖誕節來了
Finally, it was the first Christmas after we entered college.

865
01:04:59,167 --> 01:05:00,292
喂
Hey.

866
01:05:02,001 --> 01:05:03,834
我們這樣算約會嗎
Is this considered a date?

867
01:05:05,042 --> 01:05:06,376
幹嘛問我
Why ask me?

868
01:05:11,376 --> 01:05:12,459
台北怎麼那麼冷
Why is it so cold in Taipei?

869
01:05:35,542 --> 01:05:36,667
換我換我 快點
Hurry up, my turn for a picture!

870
01:05:36,792 --> 01:05:38,667
快點啦 快走了
Hurry up! It's leaving.

871
01:05:56,542 --> 01:05:57,584
沒有拍到
Oops, I didn't get it.

872
01:06:00,084 --> 01:06:00,751
你
You.

873
01:06:05,084 --> 01:06:06,251
不要跑
Come back.

874
01:06:24,251 --> 01:06:25,709
柯景騰
Ko Ching-Teng.

875
01:06:26,751 --> 01:06:28,501
你真的很喜歡我嗎
Do you really like me a lot?

876
01:06:29,167 --> 01:06:30,084
喜歡啊
Yes, I do.

877
01:06:31,376 --> 01:06:32,751
很喜歡啊
Very much

878
01:06:34,917 --> 01:06:38,876
我總覺得你把我想得太好了
I always feel that you give me too much credit

879
01:06:39,584 --> 01:06:41,584
我根本沒有你想的那麼好
I'm not as good as you think

880
01:06:42,376 --> 01:06:48,001
你喜歡我 讓我覺得有點怪怪的
I feel weird about the fact that you like me.

881
01:06:49,709 --> 01:06:51,334
哪裡奇怪
What's so weird about it?

882
01:06:52,876 --> 01:06:55,917
我也會有你不知道的一面啊
There is another side of me that you don't know about

883
01:06:56,042 --> 01:06:59,501
在家裡我也會很邋遢
I am very sloppy at home.

884
01:06:59,626 --> 01:07:00,876
嗯…
Emm...

885
01:07:01,001 --> 01:07:02,876
也會有起床氣
I get very grumpy when I wake up early.

886
01:07:04,417 --> 01:07:08,167
也會因為一點小事就跟我妹發脾氣
And I get pissed off with my little sister at times just for minor stuff

887
01:07:09,209 --> 01:07:10,626
我就
I am... you know.

888
01:07:10,751 --> 01:07:12,376
很普通啊
Very ordinary.

889
01:07:19,792 --> 01:07:22,626
說不定你喜歡上的
Maybe, the person that you like

890
01:07:23,042 --> 01:07:25,001
只是你想像出來的我
is in your imagination

891
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:27,834
我沒那麼會想像
I am not that imaginative.

892
01:07:31,459 --> 01:07:32,626
真的
Look.

893
01:07:33,126 --> 01:07:34,751
你仔細想想
Think carefully.

894
01:07:35,334 --> 01:07:36,876
你有那麼喜歡我嗎
Do you like me that much?

895
01:07:37,542 --> 01:07:38,667
喜歡啊
Hell yeah.

896
01:07:41,042 --> 01:07:42,709
你很幼稚耶
You are so childish.

897
01:07:42,834 --> 01:07:44,334
你都沒有仔細想
You didn't even think through it.

898
01:07:44,459 --> 01:07:45,667
你想好再跟我說
Think about it carefully before you tell me.

899
01:07:50,334 --> 01:07:52,417
沈佳宜是什麼意思呢
What did Shen Chia-Yi mean?

900
01:07:52,834 --> 01:07:55,001
她是不是想委婉的拒絕我呢
Was she trying to turn me down in a nice way?

901
01:07:55,626 --> 01:07:57,001
我很害怕
I was afraid.

902
01:07:57,667 --> 01:08:01,167
一直以來 我都以為我自己是個超有自信的人
For a long time, I always thought that I am a confident guy.

903
01:08:01,709 --> 01:08:03,501
但那時我才發現
At that moment, I realized that

904
01:08:03,626 --> 01:08:07,917
原來在喜歡的女孩面前 我是個膽小鬼
I was really a coward in front of the girl I liked.

905
01:08:37,251 --> 01:08:38,417
妳許什麼願啊
What do you wish for?

906
01:08:40,084 --> 01:08:42,292
自己寫自己的 不可以偷看
Write your own, no peeking.

907
01:08:44,251 --> 01:08:45,709
這麼小氣
Come on, I just want to have a look.

908
01:08:56,584 --> 01:08:57,417
沈佳宜
Shen Chia-Yi

909
01:09:00,209 --> 01:09:01,751
我很喜歡妳
I like you very much

910
01:09:01,876 --> 01:09:03,209
非常喜歡妳
I like you a lot.

911
01:09:04,542 --> 01:09:07,959
總有一天 我一定要追到妳
One day you will be mine.

912
01:09:08,626 --> 01:09:11,876
百分之一千萬 一定會追到妳
One day, I will make you mine.

913
01:09:17,584 --> 01:09:19,251
你想知道答案嗎
Do you want to know the answer?

914
01:09:20,876 --> 01:09:22,667
我現在就可以告訴你
I can tell you right now.

915
01:09:27,542 --> 01:09:28,209
不要
No

916
01:09:30,292 --> 01:09:31,709
我沒有問妳
I didn't ask you.

917
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:34,501
所以妳也不可以拒絕我
So you can't turn me down.

918
01:09:36,709 --> 01:09:38,167
你真的不想知道
You really don't want to know?

919
01:09:41,084 --> 01:09:42,709
拜託不要現在告訴我
Please don't tell me now.

920
01:09:45,376 --> 01:09:48,917
請讓我 繼續喜歡妳
Just let me keep on liking you.

921
01:10:06,751 --> 01:10:09,126
每一個男生都想在自己心上人面前
Every guy wants to show his strongest side.

922
01:10:09,251 --> 01:10:11,001
展現自己最強的一面
Especially in front of the girl he likes.

923
01:10:11,709 --> 01:10:14,376
而我又應該展現什麼給沈佳宜看呢
So what should I show to Shen Chia-Yi?

924
01:10:14,834 --> 01:10:19,042
我想了很久 終於有一天我悟出了答案
It took me a long time before the answer suddenly hit me one day.

925
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:34,376
你就去廁所尿尿 是會怎樣啊
Why can't you just go pee in the toilet?

926
01:10:35,126 --> 01:10:36,251
很遠耶
Man, it's far.

927
01:10:39,334 --> 01:10:41,334
你要出門啊
Hey, are you going out?

928
01:10:41,959 --> 01:10:43,667
順便幫我拿去倒一下
Empty this for me on your way out, will you?

929
01:10:46,251 --> 01:10:47,292
有沒有搞錯啊
You fucking serious?

930
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:50,626
幫同學倒尿 也是友情的…
Come on, just do me a favor...

931
01:10:52,001 --> 01:10:53,167
你們不覺得
Don't you guys think.

932
01:10:53,292 --> 01:10:54,876
是時候戰鬥了嗎
It's time to battle?

933
01:10:57,126 --> 01:10:58,334
我們來
Come on.

934
01:10:58,459 --> 01:10:59,459
打架吧
Let's fight

935
01:11:02,417 --> 01:11:02,876
我要辦比賽
I am organizing a competition.

936
01:11:03,001 --> 01:11:04,209
有沒有人要參加的
Anyone wants to join me?

937
01:11:05,834 --> 01:11:07,126
有沒有人要參加比賽
Anyone wants to join the competition?

938
01:11:09,209 --> 01:11:09,751
有沒有人要打架的
Anyone wants to fight?

939
01:11:09,876 --> 01:11:11,626
我有辦打架比賽
Fighting competition, anyone?

940
01:11:12,417 --> 01:11:13,667
要不要參加比賽
Do you want to fight in a competition?

941
01:11:13,792 --> 01:11:15,042
要不要參加格鬥比賽
Do you want to fight in a combat tournament?

942
01:11:15,167 --> 01:11:16,334
有沒有人要打架
Anyone wants to fight?

943
01:11:16,459 --> 01:11:17,334
有沒有人要
Anyone wants to join?

944
01:11:19,917 --> 01:11:22,501
我可以 看完嗎
Can I stay until you guys finish?

945
01:11:22,626 --> 01:11:23,834
一般運動有什麼了不起
What's the big deal with the regular sports?

946
01:11:23,959 --> 01:11:26,042
當然自由格鬥比較屌啊
Combat is definitely cooler.

947
01:11:27,084 --> 01:11:28,584
真的啦 妳一定要來看喔
Seriously, you have to be here

948
01:11:28,709 --> 01:11:29,709
我剛已經貼出海報了
I just put out posters.

949
01:11:29,834 --> 01:11:31,584
到時候一定大爆滿
It's going to be a full house.

950
01:11:32,292 --> 01:11:34,459
你為什麼要辦這麼危險的比賽
Why do you want to organize such a dangerous competition?

951
01:11:34,584 --> 01:11:36,376
你們學校都不用唸書的嗎
Don't you guys need to study and look after your marks?

952
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:37,667
就是因為大家都只會唸書
Exactly! People study way too hard.

953
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:39,667
所以才需要運動一下
That's why they need to exercise

954
01:11:39,792 --> 01:11:40,959
我要幫他們特訓
I want to give them some trainings.

955
01:11:41,792 --> 01:11:43,167
還不就是打架
It's just a fight.

956
01:11:43,876 --> 01:11:47,251
這麼說 也可以啦
Fine, if you really want to put it that way

957
01:11:49,376 --> 01:11:52,292
有時候 我真的很不瞭解你
I really don't get you sometimes.

958
01:12:11,959 --> 01:12:13,709
簡單啦
You can nail this easily

959
01:12:16,417 --> 01:12:18,584
我以為大學裡都是娘炮
I thought everyone in college was a pussy

960
01:12:19,042 --> 01:12:20,292
我錯了
I was wrong.

961
01:12:20,792 --> 01:12:22,126
有個硬漢叫建偉
There was a tough guy named Chien-Wei.

962
01:12:22,251 --> 01:12:25,667
他是胎拳社的副主將 黑帶
He was the second chair of the taekwondo club, a black belt.

963
01:12:25,792 --> 01:12:27,084
看起來很臭屁
He looked cocky.

964
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:29,459
看起來很強
And he looked tough.

965
01:12:30,251 --> 01:12:31,792
正合我意
Just the kind of guy that I was looking for.

966
01:12:33,751 --> 01:12:36,792
比照天下第一武道大會的規定
We follow the rules of the highest martial arts order in the world.

967
01:12:36,917 --> 01:12:38,751
不可以殺死對方
No killing.

968
01:12:38,876 --> 01:12:40,334
不可以出界
You cannot go outside of the boundaries.

969
01:12:40,459 --> 01:12:42,376
不可以踢小雞雞
No kicking on penises.

970
01:12:43,126 --> 01:12:46,542
倒地後數到十沒有爬起來也算輸
You lose if you are knocked down and unableto get up after the referee counts to 10.

971
01:12:47,334 --> 01:12:48,876
預備
Ready!

972
01:12:49,792 --> 01:12:51,126
穿上
Put it on.

973
01:12:51,251 --> 01:12:52,376
三小啊
What the hell?

974
01:12:52,834 --> 01:12:55,001
穿上它 我才敢打你
Wear it so I know I won't kill you.

975
01:12:56,167 --> 01:12:57,876
穿你的屁股啦
Go fuck yourself.

976
01:13:17,251 --> 01:13:18,334
開始
Go

977
01:13:31,167 --> 01:13:32,709
我要殺死你
I am going to kill you.

978
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:48,292
快 羚羊拳
Punch him with Gazelle punch.

979
01:14:04,959 --> 01:14:06,417
站起來

打他的肝臟
Beat him up.

985
01:14:22,001 --> 01:14:24,917

986
01:14:39,584 --> 01:14:50,001
1…2…3…4…5…6…7…
One... Two... Three... Four... Five... Six... Seven.

987
01:14:50,126 --> 01:14:53,084
柯騰 站起來
Ko-Teng stand up.

988
01:14:53,209 --> 01:14:54,084
你再不起來
Stand up now.

989
01:14:54,209 --> 01:14:55,876
我就要數完了耶
Time is running out.

990
01:14:56,001 --> 01:14:57,417
柯騰
Ko-Teng.

991
01:14:57,542 --> 01:14:59,042
快反擊
Fight back.

992
01:15:17,292 --> 01:15:18,501
那誰 好正喔
Who is that? She's so hot.

993
01:15:23,376 --> 01:15:25,209
剛剛比賽結束的時候 我都沒有看到妳
Hey! I didn't see you when the game was over

994
01:15:25,334 --> 01:15:26,376
我還以為被打昏了耶
I thought I was knocked out...

995
01:15:26,709 --> 01:15:27,959
妳剛剛有看到那男的嗎
Did you see that guy?

996
01:15:28,084 --> 01:15:29,209
他超厲害的耶
He kicked my ass so bad

997
01:15:29,334 --> 01:15:29,917
我一直閃不開他的腳
I couldn't get away from him.

998
01:15:30,042 --> 01:15:31,126
很好玩嗎
Was it fun?

999
01:15:31,501 --> 01:15:32,542
還不錯啊
Not bad!

1000
01:15:32,667 --> 01:15:34,251
妳來看 我超開心的耶
I was so excited when I saw you!

1001
01:15:34,376 --> 01:15:37,001
我問你 很好玩嗎
Answer my question, was it fun?

1002
01:15:38,459 --> 01:15:39,667
幹嘛啦
Now what?

1003
01:15:40,126 --> 01:15:41,959
你辦這什麼奇怪的比賽啊
Why did you insist on organizing such a weird competition?

1004
01:15:42,459 --> 01:15:44,542
你辦這比賽的意義到底在哪裡
What's the meaning of it?

1005
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:46,709
妳不覺得很炫嗎
Don't you think it's super cool?

1006
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:48,542
兩個男人之間 一定要分出勝負那種…
That kind of... win or lose between two men.

1007
01:15:48,667 --> 01:15:50,251
還不就是打架
It's just violence.

1008
01:15:50,376 --> 01:15:51,334
柯景騰
Ko Ching-Teng.

1009
01:15:51,459 --> 01:15:53,876
你特地辦一個比賽把自己搞受傷
You organized a game to get yourself hurt.

1010
01:15:54,001 --> 01:15:55,376
你怎麼會這麼幼稚啊
Why are you so childish?

1011
01:15:56,834 --> 01:15:57,667
幼稚
Childish?

1012
01:15:58,042 --> 01:15:59,667
對 就是幼稚
Right, childish.

1013
01:15:59,792 --> 01:16:01,126
很幼稚
Very childish.

1014
01:16:01,251 --> 01:16:02,084
我問你
Let me ask you something.

1015
01:16:02,209 --> 01:16:04,834
你辦這奇怪的比賽 到底讓你學到什麼
What exactly did you learn from this game?

1016
01:16:05,709 --> 01:16:07,001
學
"Learn"?

1017
01:16:07,126 --> 01:16:09,501
不見得做什麼事情都一定要學到什麼吧
Why do I have to learn something from everything that I do?

1018
01:16:10,042 --> 01:16:12,709
至少讓你學到了 辦這種比賽會受傷
At least you learned that having a competition like this will get yourself hurt.

1019
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:15,001
而受這種傷一點必要都沒有
And it is totally unnecessary.

1020
01:16:15,376 --> 01:16:16,542
你真的很幼稚
You are so childish.

1021
01:16:16,667 --> 01:16:19,167
你身上的傷 我只能說是你活該
See those bruises on your face? You deserve it

1022
01:16:19,876 --> 01:16:20,959
我幼稚
I am childish?

1023
01:16:21,084 --> 01:16:23,501
妳知不知道這格鬥賽對我來說是很棒的經驗啊
Do you know this competition is a fantastic experience for me?

1024
01:16:23,626 --> 01:16:25,626
妳可不可以單純替我高興就好啊
Can't you just be happy for me?

1025
01:16:26,792 --> 01:16:28,209
你以後還要辦這種比賽
So you are going to do it again?

1026
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:29,292
當然要辦啊
Of course I will do it again.

1027
01:16:29,417 --> 01:16:30,459
為什麼不辦
Why not?

1028
01:16:31,417 --> 01:16:32,251
幼稚
Grow up will you?

1029
01:16:33,834 --> 01:16:36,084
妳為什麼總要否定對我很重要的東西呀
Why do you always look down on things that matter to me?

1030
01:16:36,209 --> 01:16:39,709
對你很重要的東西 竟然是讓你傷害你自己嗎
Things that matter to you are things that hurt you?

1031
01:16:42,459 --> 01:16:43,167
對啦
Fine

1032
01:16:43,292 --> 01:16:43,917
我就是幼稚
I am childish.

1033
01:16:44,042 --> 01:16:46,126
才會追妳這種努力用功讀書的女生
And that's why I would go after such a good school girl like you

1034
01:16:46,251 --> 01:16:48,459
我就是幼稚 才有辦法追妳這麼久
I am this naive so I could chase you for so long.

1035
01:16:55,209 --> 01:16:57,459
那你就不要追了啊
Stop trying then.

1036
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:11,501
笨蛋
Idiot.

1037
01:17:11,876 --> 01:17:14,126
對啦 我就是笨蛋啦
Right! I am an idiot.

1038
01:17:15,542 --> 01:17:16,584
大笨蛋
Moron.

1039
01:17:17,209 --> 01:17:19,126
大笨蛋才能追妳那麼久
Only a moron can keep on trying to chase after you for such a long time.

1040
01:17:20,917 --> 01:17:22,459
你什麼都不懂
You don't understand anything.

1041
01:17:22,917 --> 01:17:24,667
我就是什麼都不懂啦
No, I don't understand anything.

1042
01:17:31,917 --> 01:17:35,417
成長 最殘酷的部份就是
The cruelest part in “growing up”

1043
01:17:36,126 --> 01:17:38,792
女孩永遠比同年齡的男孩成熟
is that girls are always more mature than guys of the same age.

1044
01:17:39,959 --> 01:17:44,251
女孩的成熟 沒有一個男孩招架得住
No guys can handle girls at their age.

1045
01:17:46,876 --> 01:17:48,126
大吵一架
What? A big fight?

1046
01:17:48,251 --> 01:17:50,501
所以這次吵完架就不會在一起了喔
Does that mean you are not going to be a couple after this?

1047
01:17:50,626 --> 01:17:52,376
你有什麼毛病啊
What's your problem?

1048
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,667
真的假的 不打算和好
For real? Not plans of making up?

1049
01:17:54,792 --> 01:17:56,792
也就是說我有機會囉
Oh yes, so I have a chance now?

1050
01:17:56,917 --> 01:17:58,501
老曹自以為熱血
Tsao took off right away on his motorcycle

1051
01:17:58,626 --> 01:18:01,709
騎著摩托車從台南直接衝到台北
and rode from Tainan to Taipei.

1052
01:18:01,834 --> 01:18:03,876
準備跟沈佳宜告白
He was ready to confess his love to Shen Chia-Yi.

1053
01:18:05,001 --> 01:18:08,042
阿和則買了最近一班的火車票
A-Ho, on the other hand, bought a ticket for the next train.

1054
01:18:17,542 --> 01:18:18,876
結論是
It turned out that

1055
01:18:19,417 --> 01:18:21,042
火車比較快
the train is faster

1056
01:18:23,292 --> 01:18:25,334
雖然我們一直很有話聊
I know we have always been good friends.

1057
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:33,751
可是其實我早就知道你喜歡的是柯騰
But somehow I always knew that Ko-Teng is the one.

1058
01:18:37,501 --> 01:18:39,376
我一直學不會的事
Being childish is something that

1059
01:18:40,084 --> 01:18:42,167
就是你最討厭的幼稚
I can never learn.

1060
01:18:43,834 --> 01:18:49,376
可是每次你罵柯騰幼稚的時候 我都很嫉妒
Even though you said you hate childish guys.

1061
01:18:50,251 --> 01:18:52,542
因為其實你罵他幼稚的時候
Every time when you called Ko-Teng childish

1062
01:18:52,667 --> 01:18:54,334
真的很漂亮
I can tell how much you likethat childishness in him.

1063
01:18:57,209 --> 01:18:59,209
你跟我說這些做什麼
Why are you telling me this now?

1064
01:19:01,251 --> 01:19:02,667
如果我什麼都不做
If I don't do anything now

1065
01:19:04,001 --> 01:19:05,542
你們遲早會和好
you guys will get back together eventually.

1066
01:19:05,667 --> 01:19:06,834
對不對
Right?

1067
01:19:13,959 --> 01:19:15,167
對不起
I am sorry.

1068
01:19:16,667 --> 01:19:19,001
這一次我想趁人之危
Since you guys are not in good terms now, I would like to take my chances.

1069
01:19:51,251 --> 01:19:56,584
看見那個畫面 老曹的機車重新發動繼續往前
When Tsao saw A-Ho and Shen Chia-Yi walked across the street, he took off again.

1070
01:19:57,792 --> 01:20:02,126
這一次 他不知不覺就繞了台灣整整一圈
This time, he rode his way around the whole island.

1071
01:20:06,834 --> 01:20:08,292
老曹繞回台南時
When Tsao made it to Tainan

1072
01:20:08,417 --> 01:20:11,876
因為恍神 醒來已經騎到了嘉義
he took the wrong exit so he went straight to Chiayi.

1073
01:20:12,001 --> 01:20:16,584
於是老曹乾脆又繼續往上騎 再接再厲又繞了台灣一圈
Then he thought why not just take another round around Taiwan.

1074
01:20:17,292 --> 01:20:20,417
不過這次他在中途停下來載我
This time, he stopped to picked me up.

1075
01:20:24,917 --> 01:20:26,084
幹嘛
What?

1076
01:20:31,876 --> 01:20:33,209
操
Fuck.

1077
01:20:36,126 --> 01:20:37,126
幹嘛
What do you want?

1078
01:20:37,251 --> 01:20:38,542
還手啦
Hit me back.

1079
01:20:42,917 --> 01:20:44,709
你以為我想啊
What's your freaking problem?

1080
01:20:45,917 --> 01:20:47,417
白癡耶
Idiot?

1081
01:21:06,084 --> 01:21:07,209
失戀了
I was heart broken

1082
01:21:08,792 --> 01:21:10,667
我失去了沈佳宜
I had lost Shen Chia-Yi.

1083
01:21:12,251 --> 01:21:16,584
我的青春 什麼都不剩了
There was nothing left in me

1084
01:21:21,584 --> 01:21:24,626
失戀那幾個月我認識了很多女生
I met quite a lot of girls after I lost Shen Chia-Yi.

1085
01:21:24,751 --> 01:21:27,542
只是那些女生的名字清一色都是四個字
It's just that they all happened to be Japanese.

1086
01:21:27,667 --> 01:21:30,334
為此我感到相當空虛
For that, I felt there was something missing in my heart.

1087
01:21:31,001 --> 01:21:32,376
櫻木花道說的好
Sakuragi Hanamichi was right.

1088
01:21:32,501 --> 01:21:33,876
左手只是輔助
You can only use one hand, your left hand.

1089
01:21:34,001 --> 01:21:36,501
因為右手要拿滑鼠
Because you need your right hand on the mouse.

1090
01:21:39,751 --> 01:21:42,126
我們這樣每天打手槍 到底有什麼意義
What's the point of us masturbating all day long?

1091
01:21:42,251 --> 01:21:43,292
意義是蝦小
Who cares?

1092
01:21:43,417 --> 01:21:44,542
林北只聽過精液
As long as I get to ejaculate, who cares!

1093
01:21:44,667 --> 01:21:46,751
沒聽過意義
I am coming, I am coming, I AM COMING!

1094
01:21:47,209 --> 01:21:49,709
現在光是大學畢業已經不夠
Even though getting a diploma might not be crucial

1095
01:21:50,167 --> 01:21:52,084
雖然說學歷並不代表一切
but a bachelor degree seems to be not enough

1096
01:21:52,334 --> 01:21:55,709
我跟阿和之間有很長一段時間沒有聯絡
I admit that I might be childish, just like how Shen Chia-Yi described me.

1097
01:21:56,126 --> 01:21:57,626
面對自己的好朋友
A-Ho has been a really good friend of mine.

1098
01:21:57,751 --> 01:22:01,209
卻連裝一下祝福的語氣都覺得勉強
But I just couldn't bring myself to congratulate him.

1099
01:22:05,834 --> 01:22:07,584
雖然我們現在念不同的大學
It'd be nice to plan things ahead.

1100
01:22:07,709 --> 01:22:10,334
可是我們可以討論看看研究所的方向
We should start thinking about graduate schools.

1101
01:22:10,459 --> 01:22:12,876
如果說妳是真的想當老師的話
If you really want to be a teacher.

1102
01:22:13,001 --> 01:22:15,542
那我建議妳可以去選教育研究所
Then getting a Master of education would be nice.

1103
01:22:16,459 --> 01:22:20,626
這樣子以後月薪也可以多一點嘛 幾千塊錢吧至少
At least people will pay you more in the future.

1104
01:23:10,626 --> 01:23:13,959
阿和和沈佳宜只在一起短短的五個月
A-Ho was with Shen Chia-Yi for only five months.

1105
01:23:14,417 --> 01:23:17,834
不過 那也夠讓我嫉妒的了
But that was more than enough to make me jealous like hell.

1106
01:24:39,501 --> 01:24:40,501
幹 有鬼啊
Fuck, what's happening?

1107
01:24:40,626 --> 01:24:41,834
靠北啊
Shit.

1108
01:24:41,959 --> 01:24:46,042
有鬼啊 有鬼啊
Fuck, what's going on!

1109
01:24:46,167 --> 01:24:51,042
快閃啊 閃啊 有鬼啊 有鬼殺來了
Ghost! Ghost! Let's get the hell out of here!

1110
01:24:53,501 --> 01:24:56,334
鬼在哪裡 鬼在哪裡
Shit... ghost? Where? Where?

1111
01:24:57,667 --> 01:24:58,834
太扯了
This is crazy, man!

1112
01:24:59,959 --> 01:25:02,501
我媽媽說 我家附近的旅館整個倒下來
My mom just called and said that the hotel next to my house just collapsed.

1113
01:25:02,626 --> 01:25:03,792
你家不是在台北嗎
You are from Taipei, aren't you?

1114
01:25:03,917 --> 01:25:05,667
震央在台北
So the epicenter is in Taipei?

1115
01:25:06,501 --> 01:25:08,501
這裡人太多了 基地台超載
It's too crowded here, the system is probably overloaded.

1116
01:25:08,626 --> 01:25:11,292
人少的地方搞不好才會通耶
Try to give it a shot at somewhere less crowded.

1117
01:25:11,417 --> 01:25:12,792
這理論對嗎
Are you sure?

1118
01:25:12,917 --> 01:25:14,334
不知道
I don't know.

1119
01:26:42,834 --> 01:26:44,042
喂
Hello.

1120
01:26:44,417 --> 01:26:45,334
柯騰啊
Ko-Teng?

1121
01:26:46,376 --> 01:26:47,251
我沒事
I am safe, don't worry.

1122
01:26:47,376 --> 01:26:49,042
可街上都是人耶
Everyone is out on the street, though.

1123
01:26:49,167 --> 01:26:50,167
嚇死我了
Thank god

1124
01:26:50,292 --> 01:26:51,709
我剛聽說震央在台北
I heard that the epicenter is in Taipei.

1125
01:26:51,834 --> 01:26:53,834
整個旅館都垮下來
And the whole building collapsed

1126
01:26:56,042 --> 01:26:57,501
總之
anyway.

1127
01:26:57,876 --> 01:26:59,626
你沒事就好
Good to hear that you are safe.

1128
01:27:01,334 --> 01:27:02,667
謝謝
Thank you.

1129
01:27:10,376 --> 01:27:11,751
那
Alright then

1130
01:27:12,959 --> 01:27:14,917
沒事我就…
better go.

1131
01:27:15,042 --> 01:27:16,292
我很感動
Wait a minute

1132
01:27:16,417 --> 01:27:17,251
真的
I am touched, really.

1133
01:27:17,626 --> 01:27:19,292
妳感動個頭啦
Yeah right.

1134
01:27:19,417 --> 01:27:21,709
妳可是我追了N年的女生耶
You are the girl that I chased for years!

1135
01:27:21,834 --> 01:27:23,209
要是妳不見了
Who else is going to share this memory with me

1136
01:27:23,334 --> 01:27:25,626
我找誰回憶我們的故事啊
if you are gone.

1137
01:27:26,209 --> 01:27:27,459
你還說呢
Hey, come on.

1138
01:27:27,584 --> 01:27:29,292
這兩年你都沒打給我
You didn't even try to contact me in the past two years.

1139
01:27:29,751 --> 01:27:31,209
你也沒打給我好不好
You didn't call either.

1140
01:27:31,334 --> 01:27:32,459
真敢講
How dare you mention it.

1141
01:27:34,126 --> 01:27:36,292
那妳最近都在幹嘛
So, what have you been doing lately?

1142
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:37,751
沒幹嘛啊
Nothing much, really.

1143
01:27:37,876 --> 01:27:39,542
還不就上課唸書
Same old thing, studying.

1144
01:27:40,167 --> 01:27:41,292
那你呢
What about you?

1145
01:27:41,417 --> 01:27:43,001
你該不會常翹課吧
Still skipping classes?

1146
01:27:43,126 --> 01:27:44,376
當然啊
Of course

1147
01:27:44,501 --> 01:27:46,167
我本來就不喜歡唸書啊
I never liked studying anyway

1148
01:27:46,292 --> 01:27:48,001
我是為了妳才念的耶
I only studied because of you.

1149
01:27:48,626 --> 01:27:50,709
哇 說的這麼好聽
Wow! So sweet.

1150
01:27:51,292 --> 01:27:54,167
那天晚上 我們聊了很多回憶
We had a long chat that night, talking about the old days.

1151
01:27:55,126 --> 01:27:58,959
好多好多用功讀書 只為了更靠近她的日子
The old days when I tried everything to get closer to her.

1152
01:27:59,459 --> 01:28:01,626
那妳有男朋友了嗎
So, do you have a boyfriend now?

1153
01:28:02,126 --> 01:28:03,542
要你管啊
It's none of your business.

1154
01:28:07,709 --> 01:28:09,209
我
I...um...

1155
01:28:09,709 --> 01:28:11,792
後來跟阿和在一起過
I... was with A-Ho for a while

1156
01:28:12,334 --> 01:28:13,084
我知道啊
I know

1157
01:28:13,209 --> 01:28:14,334
我有聽他說
I heard.

1158
01:28:14,459 --> 01:28:15,917
但後來為什麼分手
Why did you guys split up?

1159
01:28:16,334 --> 01:28:19,042
我一直不想問他 想到就度爛
I didn't want to ask him cause that just made me want to kick his ass.

1160
01:28:19,626 --> 01:28:21,042
他對妳不好嗎
Was he mean to you?

1161
01:28:21,709 --> 01:28:23,126
也不是
Not really

1162
01:28:24,251 --> 01:28:28,292
我只是覺得 阿和不夠喜歡我
I just felt that he didn't like me that much.

1163
01:28:29,042 --> 01:28:31,584
阿和很喜歡妳
No, A-Ho was crazy about you, head over heels!

1164
01:28:33,959 --> 01:28:39,917
被你喜歡過 很難覺得別人有那麼喜歡我
Having being loved by you makes it harder for me to feel other's love.

1165
01:28:40,501 --> 01:28:42,584
哇 這麼感人啊
You are kidding me right?

1166
01:28:43,001 --> 01:28:45,709
你不要破壞氣氛喔現在
Don't ruin it now.

1167
01:28:48,959 --> 01:28:50,626
沈佳宜
Hey, Shen Chia-Yi.

1168
01:28:52,501 --> 01:28:53,917
我可不可以問妳
Can I ask you a question?

1169
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:57,376
為什麼當時沒有想要和我在一起啊
Why didn't you want to be with me at that time?

1170
01:28:58,917 --> 01:29:00,709
常常聽到人家說啊
You know...

1171
01:29:01,459 --> 01:29:03,501
戀愛最美好的時候
People always say that the most wonderful time of a relationship

1172
01:29:03,626 --> 01:29:05,417
就是暖昧的時候
happens before it really happens.

1173
01:29:06,501 --> 01:29:08,292
等到真正在一起了
When two people are together.

1174
01:29:08,959 --> 01:29:12,001
很多感覺都會消失不見
The magic vanishes easily.

1175
01:29:12,959 --> 01:29:16,917
所以我就想 乾脆就讓你再追我久一點
So I thought it'd be better if I let you chase me longer.

1176
01:29:17,042 --> 01:29:21,376
不然等你追到我之後就變懶了 那我不是很虧嗎
Otherwise, if we got together right away, it'd be less fun.

1177
01:29:21,709 --> 01:29:23,209
妳真的很雞巴耶
Man, that's slack!

1178
01:29:30,459 --> 01:29:31,834
沈佳宜
Shen Chia-Yi.

1179
01:29:32,751 --> 01:29:35,667
妳相信有平行時空嗎
Do you believe in parallel universe?

1180
01:29:39,667 --> 01:29:45,376
也許在那個平行時空裡 我們是在一起的
Maybe in that universe, we are together.

1181
01:29:47,126 --> 01:29:48,834
真羨慕他們啊
How I envy them.

1182
01:29:54,084 --> 01:29:56,626
謝謝你喜歡我
Thank you for liking me.

1183
01:30:01,751 --> 01:30:03,334
我也很喜歡
Yes.

1184
01:30:04,001 --> 01:30:05,792
當年喜歡妳的我
Thank you for letting me like you in those years.

1185
01:30:07,334 --> 01:30:11,084
妳永遠是我眼中的蘋果
You are always the apple of my eye.

1186
01:30:19,876 --> 01:30:20,792
大四了
Then it came to Senior year.

1187
01:30:20,917 --> 01:30:24,167
我身邊的每一個人都在準備考研究所
Everyone around me was preparing for grad schools

1188
01:30:24,292 --> 01:30:26,667
我不曉得我將來想做什麼
I had no idea what I wanted to do at that time.

1189
01:30:26,792 --> 01:30:29,959
可是每個人都在唸書 弄得我很緊張
Everyone was studying so hard and it made me nervous.

1190
01:30:30,084 --> 01:30:32,626
只好跟著大家一起跑圖書館
So I decided to join them in the library.

1191
01:30:34,792 --> 01:30:38,917
但莫名其妙的 我卻開始在網路上寫起了小說
And out of the blue, I started to write stories on my blog.

1192
01:31:16,792 --> 01:31:19,667
老曹退伍後沒去美國打NBA
Tsao didn't make his way to NBA.

1193
01:31:19,792 --> 01:31:21,792
反而跑去二手車廠賣車
He ended up selling second hand cars.

1194
01:31:22,501 --> 01:31:23,834
他是天生好手
And it turned out he's pretty good at it.

1195
01:31:23,959 --> 01:31:26,001
平均每兩天就可以賣出一台車
On average, he sells one car every other day.

1196
01:31:26,126 --> 01:31:26,792
嚇死人了
Unbelievable.

1197
01:31:26,917 --> 01:31:28,626
引擎聲 它騙不了人的
The engine never lies.

1198
01:31:28,751 --> 01:31:29,334
來
Here.

1199
01:31:29,459 --> 01:31:31,584
你的右腳輕踩一下油門
Put your foot on the gas gently.

1200
01:31:38,251 --> 01:31:40,251
是不是 還沒改喔
Hear that sound?

1201
01:31:40,376 --> 01:31:43,917
還沒改之前 它的聲線就已經非常的飽滿
It's this powerful before we upgrade it, can you imagine if we do?

1202
01:31:44,042 --> 01:31:47,084
當它上路之後 轉速到達兩千TURBO
I bet it is going to run over 2000 rpm when it hits the road.

1203
01:31:47,209 --> 01:31:50,209
馬力可說是隨傳隨到
The horsepower is beyond your imagination.

1204
01:31:50,667 --> 01:31:51,834
怎麼樣啊 喜歡吧
What do you think? You like it?

1205
01:31:51,959 --> 01:31:52,626
喜歡
I like it.

1206
01:31:52,751 --> 01:31:55,084
喜歡的話 我們上路開一段怎麼樣
Well then, how about we take this beast out for a ride?

1207
01:31:55,209 --> 01:31:55,709
好
Okay.

1208
01:31:56,251 --> 01:31:57,209

GO

1209
01:31:58,876 --> 01:32:00,917
該邊考上了公務員
Groin passed the government worker's exam.

1210
01:32:01,042 --> 01:32:03,917
在永和市立圖書館當行政課員
He is now working as a librarian.

1211
01:32:04,042 --> 01:32:06,709
每天都在騙無知的小美眉
Which he gets to play perform magic to young innocent girls every day.

1212
01:32:08,542 --> 01:32:12,542
同學 看清楚這本書 吹口氣吧
See this book? Blow on it.

1213
01:32:19,542 --> 01:32:20,834
看仔細喔
Now, pay attention.

1214
01:32:24,501 --> 01:32:26,209
你神經病啊
Are you nuts?

1215
01:32:26,667 --> 01:32:27,834
給我站住
Stop there.

1216
01:32:28,251 --> 01:32:31,042
阿和那個胖子在當保險業務
A-Ho became an insurance sales man.

1217
01:32:31,167 --> 01:32:32,584
很喜歡開車的他
He loves driving his car.

1218
01:32:32,709 --> 01:32:37,376
平均一天有十二個小時都待在車上 雖然有點狼狽
Every day he spends about 12 hours in it, even though it's tough

1219
01:32:37,501 --> 01:32:39,251
但他一定會成功的
I do believe he will succeed one day.

1220
01:32:39,376 --> 01:32:43,334
畢竟他可是我們之間唯一追到過沈佳宜的人啊
After all he is the only person who has officially dated Shen Chia-Yi.

1221
01:32:49,042 --> 01:32:50,501
喂 李先生嗎
Hello, is this Mr. Lee?

1222
01:32:50,626 --> 01:32:52,626
是是 我是
Yes, speaking.

1223
01:32:52,751 --> 01:32:55,542
對啊 就是上次跟您提過的那個壽險型保單喔
Hi, remember the insurance plan that I talked to you about last time?

1224
01:32:55,667 --> 01:32:57,292
我已經把資料都準備好了
I have already gathered all the information for you.

1225
01:32:57,417 --> 01:33:01,126
那是不是跟您約個時間到您公司去跟您做個詳細的說明
Just wondering when is a good time to pay you a visit in your office.

1226
01:33:03,209 --> 01:33:08,709
勃起大學畢業後先去當兵 然後立刻飛去美國念碩士
Boner flew to America for graduate school immediately after his military service.

1227
01:33:08,834 --> 01:33:10,626
勃起的英文很爛
Boner's English sucked

1228
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:14,292
我真不知道他是哪來的勇氣去美國玩大冒險
I don't know how the hell he had the guts to go to the States.

1229
01:33:14,417 --> 01:33:17,709
大概真的很想換個國家打手槍吧
Perhaps he wanted to masturbate in a different country.

1230
01:33:17,834 --> 01:33:21,167
如果書念不會 就儘管回來 知道嗎
If you can't stand it, just come back, understand?

1231
01:33:21,292 --> 01:33:23,417
媽 妳不要亂講話啦
Ma, stop talking nonsense

1232
01:33:23,542 --> 01:33:25,167
媽媽是跟你說真的啦
I am serious.

1233
01:33:25,292 --> 01:33:26,959
你如果書念不好就回來
If it's too hard, then just come back

1234
01:33:27,084 --> 01:33:29,042
媽媽不會罵你啦
I will not blame you, I promise.

1235
01:33:33,126 --> 01:33:35,042
媽 我知道啦
Fine, I got it.

1236
01:33:40,667 --> 01:33:43,126
來跟爸爸說再見一下
Okay, it's dad's turn to say good-bye now.

1237
01:33:48,167 --> 01:33:51,917
勃起這一飛 兩年又過去了
Two years gone by while Boner was overseas.

1238
01:33:54,084 --> 01:33:56,126
對了 還有胡家瑋
Oh, yes, and there is Hu Chia-Wei.

1239
01:34:02,626 --> 01:34:05,042
那一個只會畫智障光頭的胡家瑋
That girl who always drew retarded stuff in her books.

1240
01:34:05,167 --> 01:34:07,667
現在有了另外一個名字
She now has another name.

1241
01:34:07,792 --> 01:34:09,251
彎彎
Wan Wan.

1242
01:34:13,917 --> 01:34:16,501
所以囉 最後會實現夢想的
So it proves that those who realize their dreams

1243
01:34:16,626 --> 01:34:18,542
往往不是最有才華的人
are often not the most clever ones in school.

1244
01:34:19,001 --> 01:34:22,834
而是直到最後 也絕不放棄的那一個人
But they are definitely those who persist till the end

1245
01:34:25,084 --> 01:34:27,584
我很高興 我看走眼了
I am very glad that I was wrong.

1246
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:35,126
當勃起把外國學歷騙回台灣的時候
When Boner came home with a foreign degree

1247
01:34:35,251 --> 01:34:37,209
我接到了一通電話
I received a phone call.

1248
01:34:41,667 --> 01:34:42,709
喂
Hello.

1249
01:34:42,834 --> 01:34:45,126
喂 老朋友 在忙嗎
Hello, old friend, are you busy?

1250
01:34:45,626 --> 01:34:46,959
當然忙啊
Of course I am busy

1251
01:34:47,584 --> 01:34:51,334
不管 這件事第一個要告訴你
I don't care, there is something that I want you to be the first to know.

1252
01:34:51,876 --> 01:34:52,584
怎樣
What is it?

1253
01:34:52,709 --> 01:34:55,376
有空讓我再追妳一次啊
You got time for me to go after you again?

1254
01:34:56,501 --> 01:34:58,626
這次恐怕不行喔
Not this time, I am afraid.

1255
01:34:58,751 --> 01:34:59,917
為什麼
Why?

1256
01:35:10,292 --> 01:35:11,084
欸 快一點啦
Hurry up!

1257
01:35:11,209 --> 01:35:12,501
今天大日子耶
It's a big day today.

1258
01:35:13,251 --> 01:35:15,334
欸 你想讓新娘子等你一個人喔
You want to make the bride wait for you?

1259
01:35:22,292 --> 01:35:23,667
乾杯
Cheers.

1260
01:35:25,417 --> 01:35:26,292
後悔了吧
Regret it now?

1261
01:35:26,417 --> 01:35:29,167
當年我這麼好追 你們全都去追沈佳宜啦
I was so available back then, but you guys all went for Shen Chia-Yi.

1262
01:35:30,001 --> 01:35:31,209
那我現在追還來得及嗎
So does that mean I still have a chance?

1263
01:35:31,334 --> 01:35:33,376
你很爛耶
You suck!

1264
01:35:34,334 --> 01:35:35,376
其實啊
I got to tell you something

1265
01:35:35,501 --> 01:35:37,709
我以前沒有認真追過沈佳宜
I wasn't really serious about chasing after Shen Chia-Yi before.

1266
01:35:37,834 --> 01:35:39,042
為什麼
Why?

1267
01:35:39,167 --> 01:35:41,042
因為我看你們大家都追她
I just didn't want to miss out.

1268
01:35:41,167 --> 01:35:43,209
所以我才跟著追她的啊
Everyone went after her, so I did, too.

1269
01:35:47,542 --> 01:35:48,501
比起我啊
In comparison to me

1270
01:35:48,626 --> 01:35:50,667
我真的覺得你們很不要臉耶
I must say, you guys are shameless.

1271
01:35:50,792 --> 01:35:52,792
人家現在已經成為別人的新娘子了
She is the bride today, but none of you is the groom.

1272
01:35:52,917 --> 01:35:55,334
你們竟然還有臉來參加這個婚禮
How dare you guys show your faces at this wedding.

1273
01:35:55,459 --> 01:35:57,084
真的是有夠厚臉皮的
Shameless!

1274
01:35:57,792 --> 01:35:58,709
許博淳
Hsu Bo-Chun.

1275
01:35:58,834 --> 01:35:59,876
我聽你在喇叭
Kiss my ass.

1276
01:36:00,001 --> 01:36:01,292
喝酒啦
Just drink!

1277
01:36:02,167 --> 01:36:04,167
好歹我也曾經追到過好不好
Oh, please, I have dated her, haven't I?

1278
01:36:04,542 --> 01:36:05,834
那是詐胡啦
That was a scam.

1279
01:36:05,959 --> 01:36:07,001
對啊詐胡啦
Exactly, cheater!

1280
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:08,030
對了 對了
Hey,

1280
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:09,639
我們來打個賭
let's make a bet.

1281
01:36:09,751 --> 01:36:10,834
我們猜拳
Let's do paper, scissors stone.

1282
01:36:10,959 --> 01:36:12,334
最輸的那一個人
The loser

1283
01:36:12,459 --> 01:36:17,584
等一下要在新郎新娘進場的時候伸腳 把新郎絆倒
will have to trip the groom when they walk in later.

1284
01:36:17,709 --> 01:36:21,209
太突然了啦 超糗的
What the hell was that? It's embarrassing!

1285
01:36:21,334 --> 01:36:24,876
你們這樣很壞耶 一點都不懂得祝福
You guys are mean. Can't you just show some love to the couple?

1286
01:36:25,126 --> 01:36:26,334
你不懂啦
You won't understand.

1287
01:36:26,459 --> 01:36:29,417
如果你真的非常喜歡過一個女生 就會知道
If you really like a girl.

1288
01:36:29,542 --> 01:36:33,251
要真心祝福她跟別人永遠幸福快樂 根本是不可能的事
It is impossible to see her marry to another guy and still bless them.

1289
01:36:33,542 --> 01:36:34,126
對啊
That's right.

1290
01:36:34,251 --> 01:36:37,501
像我們這種背後放箭的 才叫做真愛
True love means someone should sneak up and stabs the groom in the back.

1291
01:36:37,626 --> 01:36:39,292
對 真愛
Correct.

1292
01:36:39,417 --> 01:36:42,626
絆死他
Trip him!

1293
01:37:43,334 --> 01:37:44,834
我錯了
But I am wrong.

1294
01:37:45,376 --> 01:37:49,834
原來 當你真的非常非常喜歡一個女孩
In fact, when you really like a girl, you'd be happy for her.

1295
01:37:50,626 --> 01:37:53,917
當她有人疼 有人愛
When you see her finding her Mr. Right.

1296
01:37:54,292 --> 01:37:57,042
你會真心真意的祝福她
You will want them to be together.

1297
01:37:57,167 --> 01:38:00,167
永遠幸福快樂
And to live happily ever after.

1298
01:38:07,417 --> 01:38:08,834
來 靠近一點喔
Come closer.

1299
01:38:10,167 --> 01:38:11,292
再一個 來喔
One more, ready

1300
01:38:11,709 --> 01:38:13,001
一二三 來
1, 2, 3, go.

1301
01:38:13,834 --> 01:38:14,709
好 OK
OK

1302
01:38:15,626 --> 01:38:19,084
恭喜 恭喜 新婚愉快
Congratulations, happy marriage.

1303
01:38:19,209 --> 01:38:19,792
快快快
Come, quickly

1304
01:38:19,917 --> 01:38:20,876
我要在沈佳宜旁邊
I want to stand next to Shen Chia-Yi.

1305
01:38:21,001 --> 01:38:22,209
我們要拍多一點
We should take more photos.

1306
01:38:25,126 --> 01:38:25,959
要拍美一點喔
How do I look? Get a pretty one for me.

1307
01:38:26,084 --> 01:38:28,459
好 來喔 來喔
All right. Here it comes.

1308
01:38:28,584 --> 01:38:29,667
準備好了
Ready.

1309
01:38:31,084 --> 01:38:32,626
來 一二三 來
Ok, one, two, three, go.

1310
01:38:33,917 --> 01:38:35,959
再一次喔 來喔來喔來喔 再一次喔 來
One more, one, two, three... done.

1311
01:38:37,209 --> 01:38:37,626

OK

1312
01:38:37,751 --> 01:38:38,417
謝謝
Thank you.

1313
01:38:38,542 --> 01:38:41,334
新郎大哥 打個商量
Hey, man, we have a suggestion.

1314
01:38:41,459 --> 01:38:42,376
什麼商量
About what?

1315
01:38:42,501 --> 01:38:44,167
我們紅包包這麼多
See, the thing is that we have loaded you with cash.

1316
01:38:44,626 --> 01:38:47,876
想親新娘 不知道可不可以耶
Don't you think we have the right to kiss the bride?

1317
01:38:49,126 --> 01:38:52,167
新娘說好 我就沒問題呀
Well, I am fine if she says fine.

1318
01:38:55,459 --> 01:38:56,126
好啊
Well, fine.

1319
01:38:59,334 --> 01:39:01,542
想親新娘可以
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1320
01:39:01,667 --> 01:39:04,584
不過呢 等一下你們要怎樣親新娘
You can kiss the bride.

1321
01:39:04,709 --> 01:39:06,501
就要先怎麼親我
But you have to kiss me first.

1322
01:39:06,626 --> 01:39:08,542
這樣才公平啊
Kiss me the way you want to kiss her, so that's fair.

1323
01:39:10,876 --> 01:39:12,459
沒聽說過來賓要親新娘
Bullshit!

1324
01:39:12,584 --> 01:39:13,876
還要過關斬將的
What kind of rule is that?

1325
01:39:14,001 --> 01:39:15,251
對啊
Yeah, no way.

1326
01:39:15,376 --> 01:39:16,542
你這樣太小氣了啦
Don't be stingy.

1327
01:39:16,667 --> 01:39:18,667
這樣不對啦
That is not right.

1328
01:39:20,292 --> 01:39:21,959
那就沒辦法囉
Well then... sorry.

1329
01:39:22,084 --> 01:39:24,001
哈哈哈 你們打的如意算…
Ha, ha... Look at yourself, guys.

1330
01:40:25,667 --> 01:40:26,876
幹嘛啊
What?

1331
01:40:28,209 --> 01:40:29,626
昨天謝謝
Thank you for yesterday.

1332
01:40:30,751 --> 01:40:31,626
真的假的啦
Are you for real?

1333
01:40:31,751 --> 01:40:33,334
還愛心考卷咧
A quiz made out of love...

1334
01:40:35,667 --> 01:40:37,001
你錯很多耶
You made so many mistakes.

1335
01:40:37,126 --> 01:40:39,667
你回去沒看參考書就直接寫 對不對
You did the problems without reading the exercise book, didn't you?

1336
01:40:46,167 --> 01:40:47,167
沈佳宜
Shen Chia-Yi.

1337
01:40:47,292 --> 01:40:48,709
妳超正點的
You were so cool when you shouted at him.

1338
01:40:48,834 --> 01:40:50,417
哭起來也超正的
You look so pretty when you cry, too.

1339
01:41:13,584 --> 01:41:17,042
雖然我還沒追到妳
Even though we are not seeing each other yet.

1340
01:41:17,167 --> 01:41:20,334
不過 那些追都沒追過妳的男生
But those guys who you don't even know.

1341
01:41:20,459 --> 01:41:22,334
怎麼可以牽你的手
Can you not let them hold your hands?

1342
01:41:22,917 --> 01:41:24,292
我自己都沒牽過
I haven't even held them myself.

1343
01:41:38,251 --> 01:41:40,709
你特地辦個比賽 把自己搞受傷
You held this game and got yourself hurt.

1344
01:41:40,834 --> 01:41:42,459
你怎麼會這麼幼稚啊
How can you be so childish?

1345
01:41:42,792 --> 01:41:43,959
幼稚
Childish?

1346
01:41:46,251 --> 01:41:47,251
就是幼稚
Yes, childish.

1347
01:41:47,376 --> 01:41:48,584
很幼稚
Very childish and totally immature.

1348
01:42:02,209 --> 01:42:03,459
笨蛋
Idiot.

1349
01:42:03,584 --> 01:42:05,917
對啦 我就是笨蛋啦
Yes, I am an idiot.

1350
01:42:08,959 --> 01:42:10,459
大笨蛋
Moron.

1351
01:42:10,584 --> 01:42:12,584
大笨蛋才會追妳這麼久
Only a moron can keep on trying to chase you for such a long time.

1352
01:42:14,417 --> 01:42:16,209
你什麼都不懂
You don't understand anything.

1353
01:42:16,334 --> 01:42:18,209
我就是什麼都不懂啦
You're right, I don't!

1354
01:42:58,209 --> 01:42:59,251
對不起
Sorry

1355
01:42:59,376 --> 01:43:00,876
是我太幼稚了
I was the immature one.

1356
01:43:18,459 --> 01:43:22,417
其實會解這種題目有什麼了不起的
Being able to solve these tricky math questions does not help anything in life!

1357
01:43:22,542 --> 01:43:23,584
我敢跟妳賭
You want to bet?

1358
01:43:23,709 --> 01:43:26,542
十年後我連LOG是什麼都不知道
I won't even know what “log” means ten years later.

1359
01:43:26,667 --> 01:43:28,292
還是可以活得好好的
And it doesn't make my life any harder.

1360
01:43:28,417 --> 01:43:29,542
嗯
Emmmm.

1361
01:43:31,001 --> 01:43:32,292
妳不相信
You don't believe me

1362
01:43:32,417 --> 01:43:33,501
我相信啊
I do believe you.

1363
01:43:33,626 --> 01:43:35,584
相信還那麼用功讀書
Then, why do you still work so hard?

1364
01:43:36,626 --> 01:43:39,209
人生本來就有很多事是徒勞無功的啊
You don't expect returns from everything you do.

1365
01:43:52,834 --> 01:43:54,542
你想知道答案嗎
Do you want to know the answer?

1366
01:43:57,001 --> 01:44:01,626
如果柯景騰跟我告白的話 我會很高興的
If Ko Ching-Teng comes and confesses to me I will be very happy.

1367
01:44:08,667 --> 01:44:11,042
沈 佳 宜
Shen Chia-Yi

1368
01:44:11,167 --> 01:44:14,751
我 喜 歡 妳
I like you very much.

1369
01:44:15,584 --> 01:44:20,084

(Ok, let's be together)

1370
01:44:21,417 --> 01:44:23,251
真羨慕他們呢
How I envy them.

1371
01:44:27,459 --> 01:44:29,459
謝謝你喜歡我
Thank you for liking me.

1372
01:44:56,209 --> 01:44:58,042
那我就繼續幼稚下去囉
Well then, I am just going to keep on acting childish.

1373
01:44:59,876 --> 01:45:01,459
一定要喔
Sure, why not!

1374
01:45:08,209 --> 01:45:11,584

<font color=#ffa500>(Happy Marriage, to the apple of my eye)

1375
01:45:31,209 --> 01:45:32,584
洋基耶
Hey, Yankees.

1376
01:45:32,959 --> 01:45:34,167
真的耶
Yeah!

1377
01:45:36,084 --> 01:45:36,917
阿建
A- Chian.

1378
01:45:52,584 --> 01:45:53,792
柯騰
Hey, Ko-Teng.

1379
01:45:54,167 --> 01:45:57,501
你有沒有想過把我們的故事寫成小說啊
Have you thought about writing our story?

1380
01:45:58,876 --> 01:46:00,501
早就想啦
Of course I did!

1381
01:46:01,167 --> 01:46:03,917
只是還想不到書名 不知道怎麼開頭
I just haven't come up a good name to start with.

1382
01:46:05,751 --> 01:46:08,251
我打手槍那件事可不可以不要寫
Hey, can you leave out the part which I was masturbating?

1383
01:46:10,167 --> 01:46:11,917
一定寫
Sorry man... that has to be in the story.

1384
01:46:12,834 --> 01:46:14,459
如果你真的要寫的話
If you really are going to write it.

1385
01:46:15,667 --> 01:46:17,084
記得把我寫帥一點啊
Don't forget to let your readers know how handsome I am.

1386
01:46:18,667 --> 01:46:20,334
順便幫我徵女友
By the way, can you put in some dating advertisements for me, too!

1387
01:46:21,126 --> 01:46:22,667
拜託 你不是要追彎彎
Come on, I thought you are going after Wan Wan?

1388
01:46:25,042 --> 01:46:26,126
都追啦
Haha, doesn't really matter.

1389
01:48:22,251 --> 01:48:25,167

<font color=#ffa500>This is the last image we shot before wrapping up shooting.
