00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:36,512
Why aren't you inside the house by the fire
instead of weaving this bag?
不進屋去烤火

114
00:07:36,614 --> 00:07:38,946
在這編什麼揹袋呢？

115
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,211
It's the first snow of this winter
How could I miss it?
這可是今年的第一場雪哪…

116
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,946
怎麼可以錯過！

117
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,327
The snow has come early this year
今年的雪下早了！

118
00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:00,328
Takun, what are you doing?
達固…

119
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:01,631
你在幹嘛？

120
00:08:04,141 --> 00:08:04,937
Takun!
達固！

121
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:12,207
Temu, your son will perform well
on sports day again, won't he?
鐵木…

122
00:08:12,316 --> 00:08:17,515
今年運動會你兒子也會有好成績吧！

123
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:20,112
Takun, what's going on?
達固…怎麼回事啊？

124
00:08:20,224 --> 00:08:21,657
You've got blood all over your body
怎麼身上都是血啊？

125
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:24,950
Takun!
達固…

126
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:31,559
Takun!
達固…

127
00:08:33,037 --> 00:08:34,368
What's wrong with you?
你到底怎麼了？

128
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,401
Chief, today Mouna Rudo from Mehebu Clan
頭目…

129
00:08:36,507 --> 00:08:39,635
今天馬赫坡的莫那魯道…

130
00:08:39,743 --> 00:08:43,839
led the Seediqs from Tgdaya
to offer a blood sacrifice to our ancestors
帶領德克達亞群在霧社血祭祖靈了

131
00:08:43,948 --> 00:08:47,042
They've occupied the whole Wushe region
現在整個霧社已經被他們拿下來了

132
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,244
We Seediqs from Toda should join them as well
我們道澤也一起加入吧！

133
00:08:50,955 --> 00:08:52,786
Let's kill this Japanese man!
殺了這個日本人！

134
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,050
No way!
不行！

135
00:08:58,195 --> 00:08:59,594
Kojima is our friend
He's a good Japanese, not a bad one
小島和我們是朋友！

136
00:08:59,697 --> 00:09:02,860
他是好的日本人，不是壞的日本人…

137
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:03,865
Go away!
走開！

138
00:09:03,968 --> 00:09:04,764
Temu!
鐵木！

139
00:09:05,636 --> 00:09:08,503
You're the chief of all the Seediqs from Toda
你是道澤總頭目

140
00:09:08,606 --> 00:09:10,699
Why don't you drive the Japanese away
and lead your own people?
你不將日本人趕走

141
00:09:10,808 --> 00:09:13,242
讓自己來治理！

142
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,609
Why should you expect
the good Japanese to rule us?
卻只求讓好的日本人來統治！

143
00:09:16,714 --> 00:09:17,612
He's right! We don't have any Japanese friends
對！

144
00:09:17,715 --> 00:09:19,546
日本人都不是朋友！

145
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,878
Don't come any closer!
不要再過來了！

146
00:09:36,734 --> 00:09:37,894
Kojima, we'll let you answer the phone
小島…

147
00:09:38,836 --> 00:09:41,236
我們讓你去接電話

148
00:09:41,338 --> 00:09:42,498
But do you have the guts to do it?
可是…

149
00:09:44,241 --> 00:09:45,868
你敢接嗎？

150
00:09:49,713 --> 00:09:51,681
Have I been bad to you?
我對你們不好嗎？

151
00:09:52,516 --> 00:09:54,381
Have I been bad to you?
我對你們不好嗎？

152
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:56,348
Kojima..
小島…

153
00:09:58,122 --> 00:10:01,091
Is this how you repay me?
這就是你們報答我的動作嗎？

154
00:10:01,191 --> 00:10:04,388
I can't fight back if you want me dead
你們要殺我，我無法抵抗

155
00:10:05,696 --> 00:10:06,993
But the Japanese government
will do anything to punish you
但是我們日本政府

156
00:10:07,097 --> 00:10:09,895
一定會因此對你們展開討伐…

157
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:15,103
We might as well die together
大家同歸於盡吧！

158
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,063
Kojima!
小島…

159
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,848
We have airplanes, but do you?
我們有飛機，你們有嗎？

160
00:10:27,351 --> 00:10:31,447
We have machineguns and cannons,
but do you?
我們有機槍大砲，你們有嗎？

161
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:37,417
Think about
how Mouna Rudo used to insult you
想想莫那魯道是怎麼羞辱你們的…

162
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:41,795
Last time when we're out hunting
they threatened to kill you all
上次打獵他們還揚言要殺光你們

163
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:43,958
Don't you remember?
你們難道忘記了嗎？

164
00:10:45,369 --> 00:10:47,599
Are you willing to die
with them in the battlefield?
現在還要陪他們一起戰死嗎？

165
00:10:48,972 --> 00:10:50,837
Temu Walis,
鐵木瓦力斯？

166
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,273
you won't have the chance to grow up
…我不會讓你長大的！

167
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:03,016
Hello?
喂…

168
00:11:06,523 --> 00:11:07,490

快一點！

173
00:11:23,741 --> 00:11:25,538

00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:03,443

184
00:12:03,547 --> 00:12:05,242
Sapu, where's my father?
薩布，我父親呢？

185
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,217
What's going on? Why did they want us back?
到底在搞什麼？叫我們回來？

186
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:18,990
Father, why did you give up Hakaw Supeitei?
父親…

187
00:12:19,096 --> 00:12:21,155
為什麼要放棄人止關呢？

188
00:12:21,265 --> 00:12:22,857
So you're back!
回來了啊？

189
00:12:28,105 --> 00:12:30,403
Come on, let's go back to our clan
走！回部落去…

190
00:12:30,507 --> 00:12:31,804
Back to our clan? You're giving up here as well?
回部落？

191
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:33,809
…連這裡也不要了？

192
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:35,037
Tado, you can't think like the Japanese
when fighting them
達多…

193
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,806
和日本人打仗不能用日本人的想法…

194
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,316
You have to think like the wind
要用風的想法…

195
00:12:41,418 --> 00:12:42,885
The wind?
風？

The wind is invisible
風是看不見的…

Baso, give up everything, everyone
and come back to the clan with me
巴索…

198
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:59,034

204
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:33,932
I went head hunting for the first time
when I was 15
十五歲那年，我第一次出草…

205
00:13:35,873 --> 00:13:39,570
I was so nervous
that my arms and legs were trembling
我也緊張膽怯，我的手腳發抖…

206
00:13:40,878 --> 00:13:45,281
But my eyes were sharp as arrows
但是…我的眼神如箭！

207
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,577
As soon as I cut the enemy's head off

208
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,684
I forgot what it was like to be scared
我忘記了什麼叫害怕！

209
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:55,954
because I knew I'd go back to my clan
因為我知道…

210
00:13:57,194 --> 00:14:01,187
to feast and celebrate, being treated as a hero

211
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:05,699
because I knew that all my people

212
00:14:05,802 --> 00:14:10,705
male and female, young and old
從今以後部落裡的男女老少…

213
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:13,537
would respect me for my bravery

214
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,544
However, it's different this time
可是…

215
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,773
這次不一樣

216
00:14:23,186 --> 00:14:25,984
We successfully offered a blood sacrifice
to our ancestors today
今天我們雖然成功地血祭了祖靈

217
00:14:28,225 --> 00:14:31,353
and are now qualified
to stride over the rainbow bridge
取得了通過彩虹橋的資格

218
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:34,225
but what awaits us now is not a festive feast
不過接下來所要面對的…

219
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,424
不是歡慶的酒宴

220
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:39,297
but to choose how we die
而是選擇死亡的方式！

221
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:41,200
Run the electricity!
送電！

00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:46,774
Before we initiated the revolt
早在起事之前…

223
00:14:46,877 --> 00:14:51,041
you knew it'd turn out like this, didn't you?
你們就知道這種結果了，不是嗎？

224
00:14:51,248 --> 00:14:53,011
My children..

...don't be scared

You've been very brave today

Our ancestors' spirits have seen it all

228
00:15:05,128 --> 00:15:08,461
But the battle to come is the real one

229
00:15:08,565 --> 00:15:12,524
It's a battle that will terrify the invaders
是要讓異族人嚇破膽的戰鬥…

230
00:15:12,903 --> 00:15:14,131
Someone's here!
有人來了…

231
00:15:14,237 --> 00:15:18,799
Sisin babblers in the forests
are driving off the scavenging crows
森林的祖靈鳥正驅趕著吃腐肉的烏鴉

232
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:24,040
The rainbow will be more beautiful
in the sunlight after the rain
水氣後的陽光只會讓彩虹更艷麗…

233
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:28,643
It's a bunch of Hans from Wushe

234
00:15:30,787 --> 00:15:32,778
Lock them all up!

235
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,295
My children..
孩子啊…

00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,392
...don't be afraid
別害怕！

237
00:15:47,904 --> 00:15:53,274
Our ancestors' spirits know we're good warriors
guarding our hunting grounds
祖靈會肯定我們是守護獵場的好戰士

238
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:57,805
The blood stains on your hands can prove it

Every one of you is a Seediq Bale

240
00:16:02,219 --> 00:16:04,949
Remember, you have to be proud
記住…

241
00:16:05,055 --> 00:16:07,990
要驕傲！

242
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:11,288
Let's cross the rainbow bridge together
彩虹橋上我們一起過！

243
00:16:58,108 --> 00:17:00,338
Nobody's guarding here

244
00:17:00,444 --> 00:17:03,345
Not a single soul on this path

245

How could it be?

246

00:17:17,127 --> 00:17:19,357
Stop! Halt!
停！停下來！

249
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,722
Don't rush uphill
I know these savages all too well
先別上去…

250
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,528
我太了解這些生蕃了…

251
00:17:35,145 --> 00:17:37,170
What a chilly night!
怎麼這麼冷啊…

This way please, General

This is Officer Kabasoa, sir
司令，這位是樺澤警部

00:38:21,357 --> 00:38:23,757
Then why are you still alive?
那你為什麼還活著？

412

He was not there when the incident happened

General, according to our investigation
司令

414
00:38:41,577 --> 00:38:42,737
根據我們的察訪

00:38:42,845 --> 00:38:44,540
there are six clans involved in the revolt
over 300 warriors in all
參與反抗的部落有六個

416
00:38:44,646 --> 00:38:46,443

You call them 'warriors'

Each of these clans took actions separately

at dawn and annihilated
the local police stations

That's why we don't think it incidental

They had been planning it carefully

you're overestimating these savages?
你會不會太高估了這些野蠻人？

00:51:42,223 --> 00:51:46,091
No matter which route we took
we were ambushed by them
不管哪個路線都會掉進他們的埋伏

538
00:51:46,194 --> 00:51:49,493
好像他們早就猜到我們的行動一樣

539
00:51:49,597 --> 00:51:51,724
These savages are too good at this
這些兇蕃太厲害了

540
00:51:51,833 --> 00:51:53,994
We should ask for more reinforcements,
otherwise..
我們應該再增兵支援

541
00:51:54,102 --> 00:51:54,830
否則…

542
00:51:57,205 --> 00:52:00,697
With thousands of soldiers
and all kinds of powerful weapons
幾千名火力強大的武裝部隊

543
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:06,544
and you ended up being toyed with
by 300 savages?
竟被三百個生蕃給耍得團團轉？

544
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:12,812
Our airplanes have been patrolling
and bombing all this time
我們飛機在天空飛半天、轟半天…

545
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:15,651
without killing any savage
為何就是打不到人…

546
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:20,956
And you call yourselves military officers?
你們這些軍官到底是幹什麼吃的？

547
00:52:33,141 --> 00:52:37,202
Those savages played hit and run
這些兇蕃打了就跑…

548
00:52:37,312 --> 00:52:39,906
They're like ghosts
像鬼一樣…

549
00:52:40,648 --> 00:52:42,639
They ran easily
over the ragged mountain paths
在連站都站不穩的山路上…

550
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:44,479
that we barely walked properly on
跑起來像飛的一樣

551
00:52:44,586 --> 00:52:47,646
We never knew where they came from
or where they disappeared to
不知道從哪裡來也不知道往哪裡去

552
00:52:47,755 --> 00:52:50,019
They were so unpredictable
完全無法預料呀…

553
00:52:51,426 --> 00:52:53,394
For example, a kid named Pawan Nawi..
像一個叫巴萬那威的孩子

554
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:57,022
We saw him here the day before yesterday
but we found him here yesterday
前天在這個地方看到

555
00:52:57,131 --> 00:52:59,292
昨天又在這裡被發現

556
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,096
Then he was here today
今天又變到這個地方來了

557
00:53:03,338 --> 00:53:06,432
These are three different places
far away from one another
這些地方距離都那麼遠

558
00:53:06,541 --> 00:53:08,941
No one knows how he managed to do so
這孩子是怎麼跑到的？

559
00:53:10,278 --> 00:53:12,007
…真的搞不懂！

560
00:53:21,155 --> 00:53:22,986
Pawan, have you fought any battle?
巴萬，你們打仗了嗎？

561
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:25,186
Pawan! -Chief Mouna!
-巴萬…
-莫那頭目…

562
00:53:29,697 --> 00:53:34,464
Chief Dahdo Nokan from Gungu Clan
was killed in a battle
荷戈社的塔道諾幹頭目…

563
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:37,697
戰死了！

564
00:53:51,586 --> 00:53:53,850
Has anyone seen Mouna Rudo yet?
莫那魯道出現了嗎？

565
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:00,484
Answer me! -No, sir
回答！

566
00:54:00,595 --> 00:54:01,459
沒有…

567
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:05,221
That old bastard!
這死老烏龜…

568
00:54:05,767 --> 00:54:07,894
He had the guts to revolt
but he dares not confront me personally
有種造反…

569
00:54:08,002 --> 00:54:11,665
卻沒種出來和我決一死戰

570
00:54:11,773 --> 00:54:14,606
What kind of warrior is he?
What kind of chief is he?
算什麼戰士！算什麼頭目！

571
00:54:17,345 --> 00:54:18,710
Be quiet!
安靜！

572
00:54:30,992 --> 00:54:33,290
They've got lines and lines of defense
and endless reinforcement
一道又一道的防線

573
00:54:33,394 --> 00:54:37,990
怎麼切都切不斷的支援線路…

574
00:54:39,701 --> 00:54:42,135
I can't believe those savages
would have battle plans so well-knit
這樣粗魯的野蠻人

575
00:54:43,104 --> 00:54:47,131
竟然有如此綿密的作戰計畫…

576
00:54:56,451 --> 00:54:59,511
Ask the high command to provide us
with gas bombs
向軍司令部申請糜爛性砲彈！

577
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:02,418
Gas bombs?
糜爛性砲彈？

578
00:55:06,361 --> 00:55:09,626
I wanted you to be civilized
叫你們文明…

579
00:55:09,731 --> 00:55:12,757
but you forced me to be savage
你們卻逼我野蠻！

580
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:22,073
You're Mouna Rudo
你是莫那魯道…

581
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:27,479
but I'm Kamada Yahiko
我可是鎌田彌彥！

582
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:31,819
From now on..
從現在開始

583
00:55:31,919 --> 00:55:40,554
you're part of the Japanese
military and police forces
你們就屬於大日本帝國軍警隊的一員

584
00:55:40,661 --> 00:55:44,563
You'll have to follow our wartime decrees
今後對軍警的戰地勒令要絕對服從

585
00:55:44,665 --> 00:55:47,156
Those of you who fight bravely
will be rewarded accordingly
對於勇武善戰者…

586
00:55:47,268 --> 00:55:49,429
我們會給予獎賞

587
00:55:50,304 --> 00:55:52,204
But those of you
但是…

588
00:55:52,306 --> 00:55:58,836
who fail to take orders from
the Japanese police or run away
如果不遵從日本警察的命令…

589
00:55:58,946 --> 00:56:03,144
will be punished harshly by law
臨陣脫逃者，絕對依法嚴辦！

590
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:05,350
Do you understand?
明白了沒？

591
00:56:07,121 --> 00:56:11,080
Now I'm announcing
the bounties of head-hunting
我現在宣布獵首獎金…

592
00:56:15,797 --> 00:56:18,732
We'll give every one of you a gun
我們會發給每個人一把槍！

593
00:56:24,605 --> 00:56:28,701
Come and sign for it after this
等一下每個人都過來登記！

594
00:56:36,484 --> 00:56:37,610
A chief.. 150 to 200 dollars
頭目…

595
00:56:38,619 --> 00:56:43,181
一百五十元到兩百元不等…

莫那魯道

601
00:57:27,368 --> 00:57:28,562
Gas bombs?
糜爛性砲彈？

602
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,399
But sir,
報告…

603
00:57:37,411 --> 00:57:40,676
Gas bombs are still being experimented on
這種炸彈還在實驗階段…

604

I'm alright. They hit my sweet potatoes

Over there!
那邊！在那邊！

619
01:00:39,393 --> 01:00:41,122
A Seediq from Tgdaya! -Where?

Chief Mouna! It's me, Pawan
莫那頭目

626
01:05:55,209 --> 01:05:56,437
我是巴萬啊…

627
01:05:59,546 --> 01:06:00,911
Chief Mouna! It's me, Pawan Nawi
莫那頭目…

628
01:06:01,015 --> 01:06:02,812

629
01:06:21,735 --> 01:06:23,066
Chief Mouna, we heard what Baso told you
莫那頭目…

630
01:06:23,137 --> 01:06:25,799
我們有聽到巴索和你說的話…

631
01:06:25,906 --> 01:06:30,138
We know that a large number of
Japanese soldiers have gathered in Suku Clan
大批日軍已經由斯庫社集結…

Time for the decisive battle, isn't it?
是決戰的時侯了吧！

633
01:06:39,753 --> 01:06:40,981
Chief Mouna, we have no family now
Why don't you let us fight?
莫那頭目

634
01:06:41,088 --> 01:06:42,817
我們都已經沒有家人了

635
01:06:42,923 --> 01:06:45,050
為什麼你就不讓我們去打仗呢？

636
01:06:45,159 --> 01:06:46,751
Like everyone else, none of us can sleep or eat
我們和大家一樣…

637
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:50,318
每天吃不飽、睡不飽

01:06:50,431 --> 01:06:54,424
and we don't want to be killed by gas bombs
可是我們真的不想被毒炸彈炸死…

639
01:07:00,774 --> 01:07:02,139
Chief Mouna, look at the tattoos on our faces
We're not children anymore
莫那頭目

640
01:07:02,242 --> 01:07:03,709
你看我們臉上的圖騰

641
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:05,745
我們已經不是孩子了…

642
01:07:05,846 --> 01:07:07,507
Please let us fight the Japanese
like everybody else
你就讓我們和大家一樣

643
01:07:07,614 --> 01:07:09,775
用力和日本人打一仗吧！

644
01:07:13,153 --> 01:07:15,519
Then I can have a good, long rest
我想好好睡個覺…

645
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:20,148
We're so tired
我們好累…

646
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:23,195
We're really exhausted
我們真的好累…

647
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:45,340
My children, do you remember
where our ancestors came from?
孩子們…

648
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:48,245
還記得我們的祖先從哪來的嗎？

649
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:49,185
Mt. White Stone.. -I know. Once upon a time...
-Let me tell the story!
白石山…

650
01:07:49,289 --> 01:07:50,017
-我知道…從前…
-我來講…

651
01:07:50,124 --> 01:07:51,352
Quiet!
安靜！

652
01:07:53,026 --> 01:07:54,391
Can't you wait?
急什麼？

653
01:07:56,363 --> 01:08:00,163
A good hunter should learn how to lie in wait!
好獵人要學會安靜等待！

654
01:08:02,302 --> 01:08:03,826
Pawan, you tell the story
巴萬你講…

655
01:08:12,246 --> 01:08:14,271
Once upon a time on Mt. White Stone
there was a big tree called Pusu Qhuni
從前從前在白石山上…

656
01:08:14,381 --> 01:08:19,512
有一棵大樹，名叫波索康夫尼…

657
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:21,281
The tree trunk was half wood, half stone
他的樹身…

658
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:25,324
一半是木頭，另一半是岩石…

659
01:08:25,425 --> 01:08:32,627
One day, a boy and a girl were born
from the tree trunk
有一天，他的樹身生下了一男一女

660
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:35,634
Then the couple gave birth to lots of children
後來這男女又生下了許多的孩子…

661
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:39,729
and here we are, the Seediq Bale

Let me help you, Awi

Pihu Walis..

Don't go! -Let go!

I'm not fighting anymore! No more!

671
01:10:29,182 --> 01:10:30,706

No more!
不打了…

You son of a bitch!
混蛋！

674
01:10:34,688 --> 01:10:36,622
What do you mean by not fighting?
-Kojima!
你說不打了是什麼意思？

675
01:10:36,723 --> 01:10:37,382
小島…

676
01:10:37,491 --> 01:10:39,652
What do you mean by that? -Kojima!
-不打了是什麼意思？

我知道你看見了什麼…

asking for your head

the most beautiful hunting ground
只有最勇敢的戰士才夠資格去守護

have to fight one another constantly
那我們和莫那魯道他們…

691
01:11:58,038 --> 01:12:00,700
是不是要不斷地互相戰鬥…

01:12:00,807 --> 01:12:06,439
to prove to our ancestors
that we're the bravest warriors?
才能向祖靈證明自己是最勇武的戰士？

Yeah, I guess so
