1
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,870
I was always wondering...

2
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,870
我常常幻想

3
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,750
what my future would be like.

4
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,750
長大後的我會是怎樣的

5
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,160
Good morning, Truly.

6
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,160
真心姐早

7
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:03,620
Morning.

8
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:03,620
早

9
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,450
Graduate from my dream school,

10
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,450
從理想的學校畢業

11
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,660
fully develop my potential,

12
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,660
發揮才華

13
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:07,750
realize my dreams.

14
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:07,750
實現夢想

15
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,200
Bravo!

16
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,200
BRAVO

17
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,870

00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,290
終於簽約成功

21
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,660
Listen,

來

23
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,700
you should learn more from Truly.

24
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,700
要多多向林真心學習

25
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,370
Do everything you can for the company.

26
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,370
替公司賣命

27
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,450
Fight for more good deals!

28
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,450
爭取更多的好業績

29
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,330
Cheers!

00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,330
Cheers

00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,040
Thank you boss.

00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,040
謝謝老闆

33
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,790
Thank you.

34
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,790
謝謝  · · ·

35
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:26,500
Wow!

36
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:26,500
哎

37
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,200
What is this, Truly?

38
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,200
真心姐這什麼

39
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,660
So shiny!

40
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,660
好閃哦

41
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,790
Congratulations!

42
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,790
恭喜姐

43
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,910
Double good news!

44
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,910
雙喜臨門哪

45
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,870
And have a perfect relationship.

46
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,870
然後遇到一份完美的愛情

47
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,160
My life will shine...

48
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,160
我的人生會像鑽石一樣

49
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,580
like a diamond.

50
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,580
閃閃發亮

51
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,290
Hsin, go tell her.

52
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,290
小欣 你去說啦

53
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,080
We've worked over time for so many days...

54
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,080
都連續加班好幾天了

55
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,160
Truly.

56
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,160
真心姐

57
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,450
Can we go now?

58
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,450
我們可以下班了嗎

59
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,750
Sure, bye bye!

60
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,750
可以  · · ·再見

61
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,660
Bye bye.

62
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,660
再見

63
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,790
- See you tomorrow. - Bye bye.

64
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,790
- 明天見 辛苦了啊 - 再見

65
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,750
Thank you, Truly!

66
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,750
謝謝真心姐

67
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,620
Hurray!

68
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,620
喔 太好羅

69
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,660
Shall we got for spicy hot pot?

70
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,660
我們去吃麻辣鍋好不好

71
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:10,250
Sure.

72
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:10,250
好呀

73
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,120
Which restaurant? I'll make a reservation.

74
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,120
想吃哪一家 我先訂

75
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:12,830
Hello?

76
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:12,830
喂

77
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,290
What time do you think it is?

78
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,290
都幾點了

79
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,200
Why are you still in the office?

80
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,200
你怎麼還會在公司

81
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,660
I've been waiting for 5 minutes.

82
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,660
我已經等了你五分鐘了

83
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,500
Sorry.

84
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,500
對不起

85
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,660
I'll go to the restaurant now.

86
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,660
我現在立刻趕過去

87
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,550
If you're not here in 5 minutes, I'll leave.

88
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,450
五分鐘不到我就走人

89
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,700
That's not enough time!

90
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,700
五分鐘怎麼來得及

91
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,080
It'll take me half an hour to get there.

92
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,080
我過去餐廳都要半個小時

93
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,910
Hello?

94
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,910
喂  · · ·

95
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,830
Shit.

96
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,830
死定了

97
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,290
Conference call with Edinburgh at midnight.

98
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,290
半夜愛丁堡那邊要視訊會議

99
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,660
Your team will stay to prepare for it.

100
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,660
你們這一組留下來準備

101
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,910
But I have...

102
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,910
可是我晚上  · · ·

103
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,410
I'll do it now.

104
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,410
我立刻就去準備

105
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,450
Look at Truly.

106
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,450
學學你們真心姐

107
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,700
What a role model!

108
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,700
優秀

109
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,540
Yes, sir.

110
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,540
是

111
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,160
Everyone.

112
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,160
大家

113
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,040
Let's stay a little longer to work on it.

114
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,040
再留晚一點準備一下開會資料

115
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,200
Go! Go! Go!

116
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,200
加油

117
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,450
Earlier done, earlier home.

118
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,450
早點作完早點回家

119
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,580
No one ever told me,

120
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,580
從來沒有人告訴我

121
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,330
the truth is... when you grow up,

122
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,330
原來長大以後

123
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,250
it's likely you'll have a not-so-good job,

124
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,250
你可能只會做一份不怎麼樣的工作

125
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,750
be in a not-so-good relationship,

126
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,750
談一場不怎麼樣的感情

127
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,830
and live a not-so-good life.

128
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,830
將就着過一段不怎麼樣的生活

129
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,040
Dunno what he wants to eat.

130
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,040
不知道喜歡吃什麼

131
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,500
It seems like Hsin is on a diet...

132
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,500
小欣好像在減肥

133
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,950
Go! Go! Go! Early done, early home.

134
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,950
加油！早點作完早點回家喔

135
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,370
She's the one who told us to stay.

136
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,370
就是她叫我們加班的啊

137
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,160
I won't get her bonus anyway.

138
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,160
業績獎金也沒有我的份

139
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,540
The manager told us to learn from Truly.

140
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,540
早上有沒有聽到經理說要跟真心一樣

141
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,500
Fuck! Who wants to learn from her?

142
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,500
靠夭！誰要跟她一樣啊

143
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,160
Working overtime for little salary.

144
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,160
工作超時 薪水又不夠用

145
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,040
She treats the company as her family.

146
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,040
她把公司當家人

147
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,870
The company treats her as animal.

148
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,870
公司把她當畜牲

149
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,200
To be honest,

150
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,200
其實我覺得她這種人

151
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,410
I feel bad for people like her.

152
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,410
也是滿可憐的啦

153
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,250
I hope I won't be like her when I get old.

154
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,250
希望我老了以後不會跟她一樣

155
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,330
Who wants to be like her! Miserable.

156
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,330
誰要跟她一樣啊 那不就很衰

157
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,290
I think...

158
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,290
我想

159
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,200
if I ran into this woman

160
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,200
十八歲的我

161
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,750
when I was 18,

162
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,750
如果在街上偶然遇到這個女人

163
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,330
I would have definitely laughed at her

164
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,330
一定也會和他們一樣

165
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,410
like them, without mercy.

166
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,410
毫不留情的嘲笑她

167
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,660
Yabiyabi. Good evening everyone.

168
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,660
呀比  · · ·晚安 各位

169
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,160
This is Guangyu.

170
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,160
我是光禹

171
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,290
Do you like who you are now?

172
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,290
你喜歡現在的自己嗎

173
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,160
When we grow up,

174
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,160
長大之後的我們

175
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,200
we become sophisticated and tend to compromise

176
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,200
爲了生存 會變得世故

177
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,580
in order to survive.

178
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,580
容易妥協

179
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,790
We become someone we don't recognize.

180
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,790
甚至變得都不認識自己是誰

181
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,160
Would you sometimes miss the time when you

182
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,160
偶爾你是不是會懷念當時那個單純

183
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,910
were rather naive and dared to dream?

184
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,910
勇敢作夢的自己呢

185
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,790
Is that part of you still there?

186
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,790
那個你 現在還在身體裏嗎

187
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,450
Do you still remember those people

188
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,450
而那些生命中很重要的人

189
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,830
who played an important role in your life?

190
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,830
你都還記得嗎

191
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,390
(MY DREAM: GO TO ANDY LAU'S CONCERT...)

192
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,390
(我的夢想: 去看劉德華的演唱會...)

193
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,580
Tonight,

194
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,580
今天晚上

195
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,450
we'll start our program with

196
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,450
我們在節目一開始

197
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,580
this song from me to you all.

198
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,580
就要送給大家這首歌

199
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,580
A song we haven't heard for a long time.

200
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,580
好久沒有聽到的歌

201
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,540
"Forget Love Water" by Andy Lau.

202
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,540
劉德華的忘情水

203
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,660
Good morning. Here is the latest news...

204
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,660
爲您播報晨間新聞

205
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,830
yesterday Alec Su of The Little Tigers

206
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,830
小虎隊成員蘇有朋

207
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,830
said he dropped out of Taiwan University.

208
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,830
昨日宣佈從臺大機械工程系大三休學

209
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,290
The whole entertainment world is in shock.

210
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,290
震驚了所有演圈  · · ·

211
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,160
Are you giving birth? Are you done or not?

212
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,160
你是在生孩子喔 是好了沒啦

213
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,540
I'm done!

214
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,540
好了啦

215
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,410
Back then, I was turning 18

216
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,410
那年即將十八歲的我

217
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,910
and truly understood something important:

218
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,910
深深明白一件很重要的事

219
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,830
History has proven that, there are mainly

220
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,830
從古至今

221
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,750
two types of young girls in the world.

222
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,750
這世上的少女大概分兩種

223
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,540
Hey, here she comes.

224
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,540
出來了  · · ·

225
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,540
Wow! How elegant.

226
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,540
哇塞 她好優雅哦

227
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,500
Oh my God! She's gorgeous!

228
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,500
天啊 她也太漂亮了吧

229
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,290
So cute!

230
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,290
好可愛哦

231
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,580
Pretty girls who are popular...

232
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,580
受男生歡迎的漂亮女生

233
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,160
Don't go!

234
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,160
不要走

235
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,370
- Wait for me! - Tao Minmin!

236
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,370
- 等等我 - 陶敏敏

237
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,120
And

238
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,120
和

239
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,790
those who are not pretty.

240
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,790
不漂亮的

241
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,540
My name is Lin Truly.

242
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,540
我是林真心

243
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,750
Sorry!

244
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,750
對不起

245
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,870
I'm the one who just fell on the street.

246
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,870
是現在仆街的這個

247
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,370
If you're a guy,

248
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,370
如果你男生

249
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,660
let me tell you a story of an ordinary girl

250
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,660
接下來我要告訴你

251
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,660
who you've never bothered to care about

252
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,660
你們從小到大從不想關心的平凡少女

253
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,910
and her ordinary life.

254
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,910
她的平凡人生

255
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:13,910
= Our Times =

256
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,160
Back then, the most important decision

257
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,160
那時候的我們

258
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,330
we had to make every day

259
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,330
每天最重要的抉擇是

260
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,120
was what to eat for breakfast.

261
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,120
早餐要吃鐵板麪還是蘿蔔糕

262
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,290
Can you please hurry up?

263
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,290
可以快一點嗎

264
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,790
Is it that tough to decide?

265
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,790
有這麼難選嗎

266
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,250
The biggest lie we had ever told

267
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,250
扯過最大的謊是

268
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,830
was on the day of exam,

269
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,830
今天要考試

270
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,160
we'd say...

271
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,160
但  · · ·

272
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,750
I didn't prepare for it.

273
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,750
我昨天沒念耶

274
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,450
Neither did I.

275
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,450
我昨天也沒念耶

276
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,330
I thought we were having math exam.

277
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,330
我以爲要考數學耶

278
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,700
The most luxurious thing to do,

279
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,700
最奢侈的享受

280
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,660
was to go shopping in the bookstore.

281
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,660
是到書局Shopping

282
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,790
Back then,

283
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,790
在那個年代

284
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,870
that was our department store.

285
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,870
那就是我們的新光三越

286
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,200
The biggest dream we had

287
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,200
最大的夢想是

288
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:58,830
was to meet our idols

289
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:58,830
有一天

290
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,290
one day.

291
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,290
能和偶像碰面

292
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,580
The shame of being shameless is shameless.

293
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,580
無恥之恥無恥矣 · · ·

294
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,200
Somehow young girls of that time

295
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,200
不知道爲什麼

296
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,870
had some kind of fantasy.

297
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,870
那時候少女有一種錯覺

298
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,290
We believed whoever collected most photos

299
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,290
好像誰買了最多照片

300
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,040
would be the most qualified person

301
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,040
長大以後

302
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,160
to marry him.

303
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,160
誰就最有資格嫁給他

304
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,660
This is Small.

305
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,660
這是小隻

306
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,410
Although large in size,

307
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,410
雖然長得很大隻

308
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,500
she is a super romantic teenage girl.

309
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,500
但是超有少女心

310
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,410
Kaneshiro Takeshi is her ex,

311
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,410
前男友是金城武

312
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,250
and now.

313
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,250
現在

314
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,620
Aaron Kwok is her fiance.

315
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,620
宣稱是郭富城的未婚妻

316
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,410
Even I am not married yet,

317
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,410
我都還沒有嫁人

318
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,370
how come you already have a husband?

319
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,370
你怎麼會有老公

320
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,580
Boss Lau...

321
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,580
劉老大

322
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,790
However hard you try, he'll never reply.

323
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,790
你寫給他三百三十三封他也不會回

324
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:45,160
What you do is called shameless.

325
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:45,160
你們倆個的行爲簡直就是無恥的代表

326
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,790
This is Meimei.

327
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,790
這是何美

328
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,410
Very cheerful,

329
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,410
生性活潑

330
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,500
but... almost too cheerful.

331
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,500
但 有點活潑過了頭

332
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,200
Girls, where are you going?

333
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,200
我的好姊妹 你們要去哪裏呀

334
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,750
Back in our teenage life, we were always

335
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,750
少女時代的我們每天除了唸書

336
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,580
doing silly things apart from studying.

337
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,580
做的都是一些窮極無聊的蠢事

338
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,500
And this is the silliest

339
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,500
而以下這件

340
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,330
among all.

341
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,330
更是蠢事中的第一

342
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,700
Ouyang is coming. He's so handsome.

343
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,700
歐陽來了 好帥喔

344
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,660
Hey, be quiet. Come on.

345
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,660
好了 別吵了 趕快看看

346
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,000
He has a style. He's here.

347
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,000
好有型喔 他走過來了

348
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,660
There is always a boy like this,

349
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,660
每個少女的青春裏

350
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,540
in every teenage girl's life.

351
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,540
都有一個這樣的男孩

352
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,620
Thank you.

353
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,620
謝謝

354
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,700
It's on me.

355
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,700
我請客

356
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,290
- 60 please. - 60.

357
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,290
總共六十塊

358
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,370
- 60 please. - 60.

359
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,370
六十

360
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,410
Somehow they're always basketball players,

361
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,410
不知道爲什麼 他們總是籃球校隊

362
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,200
secret crush for every girl in the school.

363
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,200
不知道爲什麼 全校女生總是一起暗戀他

364
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,080
I feel Ouyang is looking at me.

365
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,080
我覺得歐陽看過來了啦

366
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,660
I think he's looking at me.

367
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,660
我覺得他是在看我耶

368
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,660
We can giggle for the whole day

369
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,660
然後因爲他的一個眼神

370
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,370
just because of a look from him.

371
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,370
傻笑一整天

372
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,700
Dear all, can you please stop helping

373
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,700
麻煩各位同學

374
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,250
those idiots send love letters

375
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,250
不要再幫那些臭男生傳情書

376
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,250
to our Minmin?

377
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,250
給我們的敏敏好嗎

378
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,790
Especially this kind of idiot,

379
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,790
尤其是這種

380
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,200
who misused "disney" for "destiny".

381
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,200
把"緣"寫成"綠"的白癡

382
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,250
This kind of ordinary, simple life

383
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,250
這平凡簡單的人生

384
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,250
was turned upside down by that very letter.

385
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,250
直到收到那封改變一切的信

386
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,950
(TO LIN TRULY)

387
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,950
(林真心 收)

388
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,040
This is a chain letter from South African

389
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,040
這是一封來自南非傳教士

390
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,830
missionary Anthony DE Croud.

391
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,830
Antnony DE Croud的幸運信

392
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,290
Now the good luck is bestowed on you.

393
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,290
現在這個幸運降臨到你的身上

394
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,040
Send 5 copies to your friends,

395
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,040
抄錄五份給你的朋友

396
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
and the good luck is yours.

397
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
可以得到幸運

398
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,910
Otherwise disasters will be waiting for you.

399
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,910
反之 你將大難臨頭

400
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,370
In 1979, Mr. Chen from Taiwan did not

401
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,370
一九七九年

402
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,160
take the letter seriously and tore it apart.

403
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,160
臺灣的陳先生不信此信將之撕毀

404
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,250
He died in a car accident the next day.

405
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,250
隔天他就車禍身亡

406
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,450
In 1963, Flayre from Holland burnt it...

407
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,450
一九六三年 荷蘭富萊爾將此信燒燬

408
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,580
3 days later, his mother started to...

409
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,580
三天後 他的母親罹患怪病

410
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,200
suffer an incurable disease.

411
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,200
醫生束手無策

412
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,720
(YOU STILL HAVE THREE DAYS. GOOD LUCK.)

413
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,720
(你還有三天時間. 祝你好運.)

414
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,040
The person I want to send chain letter to

415
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,040
我最想把幸運信給他的人

416
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,450
the most, is Lin Sincere.

417
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,450
是林誠意

418
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,040
My brother.

419
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,040
我的哥哥

420
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,700
Your brother advanced

421
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,700
你哥哥這次考試吼

422
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,950
5 places in this exam.

423
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,950
進步了五名吶

424
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,580
Last time he got the lowest score. Besides,

425
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,580
他上次考全班最後一名

426
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,620
he's spent 7 years on a 5-year program...

427
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,620
而且他五專唸了七年還沒畢業

428
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,080
Don't you talk back!

429
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,080
你還頂嘴

430
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,160
Only if you could get half of the grade

431
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,160
你的分數要是有人家那個陶敏敏

432
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,370
of Tao Minmin's.

433
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,370
一半好就好

434
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,950
30 points.

435
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,950
考三十分

436
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,700
You even tried to alter it

437
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,700
還改分數

438
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:58,950
with a different color.

439
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:58,950
用不一樣的顏色

440
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,290
How stupid!

441
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,290
怎麼那麼笨吶

442
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,330
My red pen ran out of ink.

443
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,330
啊就紅筆沒有水啊

444
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,250
Couldn't you borrow one from your teacher?

445
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,250
啊不會去跟老師借哦

446
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:05,950
That's right.

447
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:05,950
對啊

448
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,790
Take it.

449
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,790
來啦

450
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,660
Thank you mom.

451
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,660
嗯 謝謝媽

452
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,500
Take one more.

453
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,500
多吃一隻

454
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,620
Thank you dad!

455
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,620
謝謝爸

456
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,330
Many of you probably had the same thought,

457
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,330
應該很多人都樣想過

458
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,450
"Am I'm really my parents' child?"

459
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,450
從小我就懷疑自己不是爸媽親生的

460
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,160
But if my brother's family is really ruined,

461
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,160
但考慮到萬一家破人亡

462
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,910
I might suffer as well.

463
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,910
可能會連累到我

464
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,200
So I dismissed that idea.

465
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,200
就打消了念頭

466
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,620
Therefore...

467
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,620
所以

468
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,450
I gave the first letter

469
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,450
第一封信

470
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,950
to him.

471
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,950
我給了他

472
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,580
Lin Truly.

473
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,580
林真心

474
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,580
Question 1:

475
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,580
第一題

476
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,160
If the balls are put in the order of red,

477
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,160
紅藍綠三種顏色的球依序排列

478
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,620
blue, green, what's the color of ball 555?

479
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,620
第五百五十五顆是什麼顏色

480
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,330
It's ok if you don't know the answer,

481
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,330
答不出來就算了

482
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,370
but why drawing it like this?

483
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,370
你畫這麼認真你是在寫生嗎

484
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,660
Don't you dodge!

485
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,660
還躲

486
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,200
There must be a psycho teacher like this

487
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,200
每個人的學生時代

488
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,370
in everyone's school years.

489
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,370
一定都有這樣變態的老師

490
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,500
"Wang Baidan".

491
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,500
"王白丹"

492
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,160
Our home room teacher and math teacher.

493
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,160
我們班導兼數學老師

494
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,700
We all call him.

495
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,700
大家都叫他

496
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,450
"Wang Badan" (ASSHOLE)

497
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,450
"王八蛋"

498
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,370
I haven't even started!

499
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,370
我還沒打咧

500
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Come back.

501
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
過來

502
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,750
You're even louder than me.

503
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,750
叫的比我還大聲

504
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,450
I gave the second letter

505
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,450
第二封信

506
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,870
to Tao Minmin.

507
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,870
我寄給了陶敏敏

508
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,450
It's definitely not because I envy her

509
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,450
絕對不是因爲羨慕她漂亮

510
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,200
for her beauty or popularity.

511
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,200
嫉妒她受歡迎

512
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,330
Not even because

513
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,330
更不是因爲

514
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,200
she's that girl who could

515
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,200
她是能被那個 "他"

516
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,700
get his attention.

517
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,700
注意到的女孩

518
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,200
It's simply because she lives next door.

519
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,200
純粹只是因爲她住在我家隔壁

520
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,290
Right on my way home.

521
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,290
順手而已喔

522
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,040
What? A good student?

523
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,040
哎喲好學生喔

524
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,750
Do the recycling.

525
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,750
做資源回收

526
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,660
Hey you.

527
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,660
同學

528
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,700
Kick it back.

529
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,700
踢過來

530
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,700
Ouyang Extraordinary.

531
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,700
歐陽非凡

532
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,540
I might've seen this disgusting name before.

533
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,540
這麼假掰的名字好像在哪裏看過

534
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,040
As there is a "God" in every school,

535
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,040
就像學校裏一定有男神

536
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,870
there is also a "boss".

537
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,870
每間學校也一定有個老大

538
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,370
Stand up.

539
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,370
起立

540
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,410
Hsu Taiyu.

541
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,410
徐太宇

542
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,200
Last number of the last class in 3rd grade.

543
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,200
三年級最後一班最後一號

544
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,250
He's the boss who leads our school in

545
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,250
就是那個代表一高和別的學校爭地盤

546
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,830
turf wars and charge others protection fee.

547
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,830
收保護費的老大

548
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:04,700
Rumor has it that

549
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:04,700
傳聞

550
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:08,290
he fights, runs away from home, he's on drug

551
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:08,290
他打架  械鬥 逃家 吸毒

552
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,790
has killed people, set fire...

553
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,790
殺過人 縱過火

554
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,540
So notorious that no school wants him,

555
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,540
惡名遠播到整區高中聯合拒收

556
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,410
except for First High School...

557
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,410
只有一高願意收留他

558
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,040
How daring are you to be here.

559
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,040
敢來這裏囂張

560
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,500
You despise us the 12 Masters of First High?

561
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,500
瞧不起我們一高十二少

562
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,250
What about Ten Brothers from Chuoshui River?

563
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,250
林北還濁水溪十兄弟

564
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,160
Kill them.

565
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,160
乎死

566
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,830
He's even appointed as school patrol.

567
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,830
學校還以毒攻毒讓他擔任糾察隊

568
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,040
Indecent clothing.

569
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,040
服儀不整

570
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,120
Eating while walking.

571
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,120
邊走邊吃

572
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,410
Studying too hard.

573
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,410
書讀太多

574
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,500
Too matured body.

575
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,500
發育太好

576
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,290
First High...

577
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,290
一高

578
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,790
has since been trapped in the devil's clutches.

579
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,790
就此被困在他的魔掌之中

580
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,370
Recycle it!

581
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,370
資源回收

582
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,870
Hey, what are you doing?

583
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,870
喂  幹什麼

584
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,870
Why bully others like this?

585
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,870
你爲什麼要這樣欺負別人

586
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,910
What the hell are you guys doing?

587
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,910
在幹什麼

588
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,330
Here comes the director,

589
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,330
主任來了

590
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,540
let's go.

591
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,540
老大 快閃

592
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,080
Come on! Go, go.

593
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,080
趕快走 快一點 · · ·

594
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,950
Chicken.

595
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,950
臭俗仔

596
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,540
Therefore...

597
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,540
所以我決定

598
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,620
I decided to send him the third letter.

599
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,620
寄出第三封信

600
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,500
Guile.

601
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,500
阿力固

602
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,370
G your mother.

603
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,370
阿你的頭啦

604
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,950
Sorry

605
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,950
Sorry

606
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,160
(TO HSU TAIYU)

607
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,370
It's pink

608
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,370
粉紅色

609
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,200
with fragrance.

610
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,200
有香味

611
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,410
Love letter?

612
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,410
情書耶

613
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,330
Aren't you over the moon, boss?

614
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,330
老大爽不爽啊

615
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,410
Over what! Get lost.

616
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,410
爽你個頭 閃啦

617
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,330
Who has the guts to write him a love letter?

618
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,330
哪個不怕死的居然敢寫情書給他

619
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,830
Oh, he was even blushing.

620
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,830
哦 他剛還臉紅

621
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,790
Blushing! Hahahaha.

622
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,790
臉紅耶 哈 · · ·

623
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,660
He must be over the moon now.

624
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,660
他在心裏一定超爽的

625
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,580
Not just over the moon...

626
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,580
什麼爽而已

627
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,290
Over the whole world!

628
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,290
簡直是爽翻天啦

629
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,500
老大 · · ·

630
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,660
Boss.

631
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,120
Did you hear about it already?

632
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,120
你們倆個有沒有聽說

633
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,620
Hsu Taiyu had a car accident yesterday.

634
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,620
那個徐太宇昨天出車禍了耶

635
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,410
Lin Truly...

636
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,410
林真心 · · ·

637
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,660
If I find out who cursed boss,

638
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,660
如果被我抓到是誰詛咒老大的

639
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,580
I'll make sure to break his arms and legs.

640
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,580
林北絕對乎他斷手斷腳

641
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,790
Sorry, she needs to take her medicine.

642
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,790
對不起 她該吃藥了

643
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,450
Lin Truly, let's go.

644
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,450
林真心 走啦 · · ·

645
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,370
Why are you so heavy!

646
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,370
你怎麼那麼重啊

647
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:26,580
Go.

648
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:26,580
走了啦

649
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,080
Boss, watch your step.

650
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,080
老大小心

651
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,080
Someone is spreading the rumor,

652
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,080
有同學在謠傳

653
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,750
saying this year's school anniversary

654
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,750
說今年的校慶

655
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,160
will be suspended due to track renovation.

656
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,160
會因爲整修跑道而停辦

657
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,160
Let me clarify it here.

658
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,160
我在這裏鄭重說明

659
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,500
This year, school anniversary festival

660
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,500
今年的校慶

661
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,330
will be held as scheduled.

662
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,330
會如期舉行

663
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,540
Since I'm retiring from First High soon.

664
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,540
個人即將在一高退休了

665
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,160
The new director will take over

666
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,160
接任的訓導主任

667
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,120
the responsibility as the organizer.

668
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,120
屆時將會承辦相關的事宜

669
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,620
Last but not least, do not leave yet.

670
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,620
最後呢 請各位同學先不要離開

671
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,080
School patrol is now conducting

672
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,080
糾察隊

673
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,370
a surprise safety inspection.

674
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,370
現在正在各班實施突擊安全檢查

675
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,160
Dahe.

676
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,160
大賀

677
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,200
Breast baring.

678
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,200
露點

679
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,250
That's too nasty.

680
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,250
太嚴重啦

681
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,120
Make a note.

682
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,120
記起來

683
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,370
Confiscate it.

684
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,370
沒收

685
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,410
Hey you.

686
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,410
同學

687
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,790
We need to talk.

688
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,790
有事找你

689
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,370
Where are we going?

690
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,370
我們現在要去哪裏啊

691
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,330
Just follow us.

692
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,330
走就對了

693
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,580
No!

694
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,580
我不要

695
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,870
Enjoy, boss.

696
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,870
老大請享用

697
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,250
In 1979,

698
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,250
一九七九年

699
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,700
Mr. Chen from Taiwan...

700
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,700
臺灣的陳先生

701
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,040
did not take the letter seriously

702
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,040
不信此信

703
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,620
and tore it apart.

704
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,620
將之撕毀

705
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,500
The next day he died in a car accident.

706
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,500
隔天就車禍身亡

707
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,540
So it's you.

708
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,540
原來是這樣

709
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
Whose films do you like?

710
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
你喜歡誰的電影

711
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,080

00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,120

713
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,870
Who?

714
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,870

720
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,660
家 · · ·家家家有囍事

721
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,290
How many "all" s?

00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,290
幾個家

723
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,160
One.

724
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,160
一個家

725
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,700
Your birthday?

726
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,700

00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,790
四月十九

729
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,950
Good, you're honest.

730
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,950
很好 沒有說謊

731
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,410
What don't you like about me?

732
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,410
你對我有什麼意見

733
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,830
Nothing.

734
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,830
沒有意見

735
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,370
I...think... you're

736
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,370
我 · · ·覺得 · · ·你

737
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:41,950

738

又高

739
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,200
and cute...

740
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,200
又帥

741
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,410
and if I look closely...

742
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,410
近看

743
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,160
You even look a bit like Andy Lau?

744
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,160
還很像劉德華耶

745
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,580
I know you sent the chain letter to me

746
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,580
我知道你爲了他

747
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,580
because of him.

748
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,580
才寄幸運信給我的

749
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,410
No!

750
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,410
不可以

751
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,830
What no?

752
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,830
啥米不可以

753
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,790
I can't change the film?

754
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,790
換片不可以喔

755
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,370
Would you like to change the film?

756
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,370
客人要換片嗎

757
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,700
Yes, to...

758
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,700
換

759
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,620
All... "All's Well, Ends Well".

760
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,620
家 · · ·家家有囍事吧

761
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,790
Sure, just a moment.

762
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,790
好 稍等

763
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,370
Let's...

764
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,370
我們

765
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,160
be friends.

766
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,160
交個朋友吧

767
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,540
What?

768
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,540
蛤

769
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,500
You just introduced yourself.

770
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,500
剛剛你已經自我介紹完啦

771
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,700
In Taiyu's dictionary, friend means

772
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,700
徐太宇對"朋友"的定義

773
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,160
unconditional devotion.

774
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,160
就是無條件對他付出

775
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,870
In order to protect Ouyang,

776
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,870
爲了保護歐陽的安危

777
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,450
I'm willing to listen to Hsu Taiyu.

778
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,450
我只能聽命于徐太宇

779
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,870
Be his slave.

780
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,870
做他的奴隸

781
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:56,830
Auntie.

782
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:56,830
老闆娘

783
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,040
One sesame noodle.

784
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,040
我要一碗麻醬麪

785
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,660
Don't put sesame dressing and noodles

786
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,660
麻醬跟面

787
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,450
together. They need to be separated.

788
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,450
它們不可以放在一起要分開

789
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,250
No fatty no lean for braised pork rice

790
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,250
然後滷肉飯不要肥肉也不要瘦肉

791
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,250
but half half.

792
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,250
要半肥半瘦

793
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,250
And veggie tofu soup without spring onion.

794
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,250
然後青菜豆腐湯

795
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,580
Two eggs in it but don't beat it.

796
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,580
兩顆蛋 不要蔥花也不要打成蛋花

797
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,290
Thank you.

798
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,290
謝謝

799
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,700
If no spring onion in veggie tofu soup,

800
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,700
青菜豆腐湯都不要加蔥花

801
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,450
why have it on sesame noodles?

802
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,450
爲什麼麻醬麪上面有蔥花

803
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,950
Get a new one!

804
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,950
重買

805
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,290
Wait.

806
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,290
等一下

807
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,500
This is your reward.

808
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,500
獎勵你的

809
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,500
Autographed photo of Andy Lau.

810
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,500
劉德華簽名照

811
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,200
It's Andy Low from the TV show.

812
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,200
是百戰百勝 "劉的華"

813
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,500
Here.

814
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,500
這邊

815
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,500
I thought you forgot your book for math

816
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,500
你不是數學課要校外教學沒帶課本嗎

817
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,830
excursion, where are the other people?

818
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,830
其他人咧

819
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,700
Idiot.

820
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,700
白癡

821
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,370
What kind of excursion for math class?

822
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,370
誰數學課校外教學啊

823
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,910
Hurry up.

824
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,910
快點

825
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,500
The movie starts at 2.

826
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,500
電影兩點開始

827
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:22,700
Ah...

828
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:22,700
欵

829
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,370
The bell rang already, I'm going back.

830
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,370
已經打鐘了 我要回去上課了

831
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,700
Then who'll get food for me?

832
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,700
那誰幫我買吃的

833
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,620
Who'll collect my trash?

834
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,620
誰幫我收垃圾

835
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,410
Who'll fan for me?

836
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,410
誰幫我扇風

837
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,660
I can't climb the wall.

838
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,660
我不會翻牆

839
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,580
So...

840
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,580
所以

841
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,290
I really can't do this.

842
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,290
真的不行啦

843
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,790
You wanna die?

844
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,790
你想死嗎

845
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,500
What if the teacher finds out?

846
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,500
被老師發現怎麼辦啊

847
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,250
I've never skipped class in my life...

848
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,250
我從來沒有翹過課

849
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,500
If you've never done that in your uniform,

850
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,500
沒穿過高中制服翹過一次課

851
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,410
you'll regret in the future.

852
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,410
長大以後纔會後悔好嗎

853
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,620
You're so heavy.

854
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,620
好重

855
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,040
Hurry up.

856
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,040
快點溜

857
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,160
Don't goof off.

858
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,160
不要混

859
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,500
Can I go back for tutorial class?

860
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,500
我可不可以回去上輔導課啊

861
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,620
Attach yourself to the end of the line.

862
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,620
你等一下接在最後面

863
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,370

864
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,370
徐太宇 我不想玩了

865
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:58,910
Are you ok?

866
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:58,910
沒事吧

867
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,410
Are you alright?

868
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,410

871
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,410
Then go get squid balls for me!

872
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,410
那去幫我買花枝丸

873
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,200

徐太宇

887
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,910
Don't you dare touch my gal...

888
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,910
林北ㄟ七辣你也敢動

889
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:38,830
幹嘛

890
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:38,850
What's wrong!

891
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,830
Holding hands when roller skating?

892
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,830
溜冰還手牽手

893
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,290
How can you do it without holding hands?

894
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,290
啊溜冰是不用手牽手膩

895
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,540
Shut up!

896

徐太宇

913
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,250
If I didn't have final exam this afternoon,

914
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,250
要不是林北下午要期末考

915
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,790

922
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,160
Miss Lin.

923
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,160
林同學

924
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,950

那天

934
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,700
Cold.

935
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,700
感冒

936
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,540
I don't... remember

937
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,540

946
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,200
回去

謝謝主任

950
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,290
What were you doing?

951
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,290
你們幾個搞什麼東西

952
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,870
School patrol skipped the class?

953
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,870
自己是糾察隊還翹課

954
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,950
Hey, school patrol!

955

想不到你還滿厲害的嘛

981
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,930

982
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,330

Ouyang knows your name!

989
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,540
歐陽他知道你的名字耶

Praised by Ouyang for skipping class...

993
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,200
翹課還被歐陽稱讚

994
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,870
Strangely amazing.

995
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,870
這也太離奇了吧

996
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,450
Look, love fire is burning.

997
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,450
看愛火在燃燒

998
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,410
Love fire is bouncing.

999
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,410
愛火在跳躍

1000
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,330
Warmly, our hearts

1001
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,330
我們的心

1002
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,370
embrace each other.

1003
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,370
暖暖擁抱

1004
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,830
I told my mom...

1005
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,830
我媽知道了 · · ·

1006
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,250
Did she give her approval?

1007
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,250
她同意嗎

1008
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,540
Yes.

1009
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,540
嗯

1010
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,120
But...

1011
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,120
可是

1012
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,250
What if the teacher finds out

1013
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,250
我們這樣被老師發現

1014
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,500
about us...?

1015
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,500
怎麼辦

1016
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,620
This is not allowed by the school.

1017
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,620
學校是不準的

1018
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,080
Don't worry.

1019
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,080
不用擔心

1020
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,250
I am the father.

1021
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,250
我是爸爸

1022
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,790
I'll take the responsibility.

1023
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,790
我會負責的

1024
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,540
So glad you're here.

1025
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,540
幸好有你在

1026
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,370
You should go now!

1027
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,370
回去吧

1028
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,830
Others can come here anytime.

1029
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,830
學生會中途跑出來

1030
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:23,950
大家會起疑的

1031
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,040
They'll find us suspicious.

1032
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,950
Was someone here?

1033
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,950
剛有人來過嗎

1034
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,250
What should we do?

1035
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,250
怎麼辦

1036
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,410
Will people find out about us?

1037
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,410
我們的事不會被發現吧

1038
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,450
We'll be fine.

1039
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,450
沒事的

1040
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,330
Let's get out of here now.

1041
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,330
我們趕快離開這裏

1042
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,290
What the fuck are you looking at!

1043
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,290
看屁啊

1044
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,660
Did you just try to drown yourself?

1045
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,660
你剛是不是想淹死自己

1046
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,500
Just for that prick?

1047
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,500
就爲了那個白癡

1048
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,910
Then what on earth are you crying for?

1049
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,910
那你在哭什麼啊

1050
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,330
You're the silly one...

1051
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,330
你才白癡咧

1052
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:22,580
Do you have it with you all the time?

1053
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:22,580
你上課都隨身攜帶這些哦

1054
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:28,330
If you never had beer in your uniform...

1055
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:28,330
沒穿過高中制服 喝過幾罐啤酒 長大以後

1056
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,700
I'll regret in the future.

1057
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,700
我會後悔

1058
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,700
I got it.

1059
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,700
知道啦

1060
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,540
You wrote this?

1061
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,540
這是你寫的哦

1062
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,790
You like Tao Minmin?

1063
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,790
你喜歡陶敏敏

1064
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,290
Dear Tao Minmin:

1065
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,290
陶敏敏同學

1066
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:09,200
When you were trying the hairpin yesterday,

1067
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:09,200
昨天你在新學友書局試戴髮夾

1068
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,330
I really longed to touch...

1069
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,330
一頭烏黑的長髮

1070
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,540
the beautiful black hair of yours!

1071
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,540
讓人好想摸一下

1072
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,250
You're so sick.

1073
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,250
變態啊你

1074
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,410
Because...

1075
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,410
因爲

1076
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,160
It's so nice to meet you

1077
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,160
認識你真好

1078
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,950
do you know that?

1079
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,950
知不知道

1080
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:26,580
Quoting lyrics... you really suck.

1081
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:26,580
爛透了還抄歌詞

1082
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,660
Now we're both kind of...

1083
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,660
我們現在也算是

1084
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,910
Association of the Dumped members.

1085
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,910
失戀陣線聯盟

1086
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,410
For the first time I think you're clever.

1087
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,410
第一次覺得你聰明

1088
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,870
What?

1089
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,870
幹嘛

1090
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,370
Let's help them break up.

1091
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,370
一起讓他們分手吧

1092
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,750
If you help me chase Tao Minmin...

1093
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,750
幫我追陶敏敏

1094
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,700
wouldn't that make your Ouyang

1095
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,700
你的歐陽

1096
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,750
single again?

1097
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,750
不就單身了嗎

1098
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,540
Sorry! Sorry!

1099
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,540
對不起

1100
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,620
Excuse me!

1101
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,620
借過

1102
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,290
Did you bring powdered milk and bottle?

1103
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,290
你有帶奶粉和奶瓶嗎

1104
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,410
Yeah.

1105
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,410
有啊

1106
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,830
Hsu Taiyu!

1107
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,830
徐太宇

1108
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,410
Sorry...

1109
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,410
對不起哦

1110
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,700
Mommy's late.

1111
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,700
媽媽太晚來了

1112
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,660
You must be starving.

1113
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,660
你肚子一定餓壞了哦

1114
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,700
Slowly... slowly.

1115
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,700
乖 慢慢吃哦

1116
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,450
Look at the eyes...

1117
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,450
你看他的眼睛

1118
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,540
So adorable.

1119
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,540
好可愛哦

1120
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,790
Just like you.

1121
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,790
跟你好像哦

1122
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,830
Should we take it to the vet for shots?

1123
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,830
我們是不是要帶它去打預防針

1124
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:22,370
Yeah. Let's do it after school soon.

1125
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:22,370
嗯 找天放學我們一起帶它去

1126
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,620
OK.

1127
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,620
好

1128
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,370
We misunderstood them.

1129
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,370
哎喲 我們誤會了啦

1130
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,660
There is nothing between them.

1131
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,660
他們根本就沒什麼

1132
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,620
Just a puppy.

1133
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,620
只是一起養狗啊

1134
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:38,120
Having a dog now together means

1135
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:38,120
雖然現在只是一起養狗

1136
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,750
they'll walk the dog together. Get closer.

1137
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,750
以後就會一起溜狗

1138
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,120
Then the dog will have more puppies.

1139
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,120
日久生情 狗又生狗

1140
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,660
We can't let this happen.

1141
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,660
不能讓這種事發生

1142
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,410
Say that again. What do you think of me?

1143
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,410
再說一次你覺得我怎麼樣

1144
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,200
You're tall...

1145
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,200
又高

1146
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,370
and cute...

1147
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,370
又帥

1148
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,160
If I look closely...

1149
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,160
近看

1150
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,450
You even look a bit like Andy Lau.

1151
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,450
還有點像劉德華

1152
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:47,050
《追夢人》鳳飛飛

1153
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:54,460
讓青春吹動了你的長髮讓它牽引你的夢

1154
00:37:54,460 --> 00:38:02,330
不知不覺這城市的歷史已記取了你的笑容

1155
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:10,800
紅紅心中藍藍的天是個生命的開始

1156
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,800
春雨不眠隔夜的你曾空獨眠的日子

1157
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,700
Tao Minmin!

1158
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,700
陶敏敏

1159
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,450
The campus belle!

1160
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,450
校花喔

1161
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,790
So pretty!

1162
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,790
好漂亮喔

1163
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,370
Our boss is hot!

1164
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,370
老大好帥

1165
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,370
Tao Minmin.

1166
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,370
陶敏敏同學

1167
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,910
Wanna be my gal?

1168
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,910
要不要做我女朋友

1169
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:16,790
大嫂 · · ·

1170
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:15,160
Say yes, Say yes.

1171
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,790
今天的事誰敢說出去

1172
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,840
If you dare to tell others what happened,

1173
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,700
you are dead.

1174
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,700
誰就死定了

1175
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:34,660
Don't you tell others boss is dumped.

1176
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:34,660
老大被甩誰敢說出去誰就死定了

1177
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:35,790
Let me repeat.

1178
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:35,790
我再說一次

1179
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,750
Don't you tell others boss is dumped.

1180
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,750
老大被甩誰敢說出去誰就死定了

1181
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,410
What the fuck!

1182
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,410
講三小啊

1183
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,700
Get lost!

1184
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,700
滾

1185
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,370
Quick!

1186
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,370
快滾啦

1187
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,950
Get out of there!

1188
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,950
快滾

1189
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,950
Hsu Taiyu...

1190
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,950
徐太宇

1191
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,250
I think... we should give up.

1192
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,250
我看 我們還是放棄好了

1193
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:15,160
Tao Minmin... will not be attracted by you.

1194
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:15,160
陶敏敏 不會喜歡你這一型的啦

1195
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,500
There is no such word like "give up".

1196
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,500
我的字典裏沒有放棄

1197
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,120
(REPORT STRAY DOGS TO HAVE THEM CAUGHT.)

1198
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,040
As long as the dog is gone,

1199
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,040
只要那隻狗消失

1200
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,410
they won't have excuse to meet each other.

1201
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,410
他們就沒有理由見面

1202
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,160
Don't do silly things.

1203
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,160
你不要衝動

1204
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,580
I got it!

1205
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,580
我有辦法

1206
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,750
Hurry up.

1207
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,750
動作快

1208
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,660
Puppy... they'll think you ran away...

1209
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,660
狗狗 就讓人家以爲是你自己跑掉的

1210
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,040
you're not stolen.

1211
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,040
不是被偷走的哦

1212
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,160
Hurry up!

1213
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,160
快一點

1214
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,160
Someone's coming.

1215
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,160
有人來了啦

1216
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,750
Such a stupid idea.

1217
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,750
想什麼爛招啊

1218
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,200
Where can he go?

1219
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,200
現在要帶它去哪

1220
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,660
Who's gonna take care of him?

1221
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,660
誰有空照顧它啊

1222
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,790
I thought you were really that cruel,

1223
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,790
我還以爲你真的那麼狠

1224
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:24,870
that you wouldn't care if he dies.

1225
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:24,870
會不管它死活

1226
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,370
Before you can find him a new owner,

1227
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,370
找到人收養它以前

1228
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,950
he's staying with you.

1229
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,950
你給我帶回家

1230
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,250
Why the fuck do you pee...

1231
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,250
怎麼尿尿

1232
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,580
Quick!

1233
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,580
快點啦

1234
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:41,620
Alright, alright.

1235
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:41,620
哎喲 好啦 · · ·

1236
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:46,450
What should we call him?

1237
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:46,450
我們要叫它什麼

1238
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,500
What about...

1239
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,500
叫

1240
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,620
Andy?

1241
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,620
"華仔"

1242
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,450
You like it?

1243
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,450
怎麼樣

1244
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,080
No way.

1245
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,080
我纔不要咧

1246
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,660
How can you humiliate my idol like this!

1247
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,660
你怎麼可以這樣污衊我的偶像啊

1248
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,830
Besides...

1249
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,830
而且

1250
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,250
It's a she.

1251
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,250
它是母的耶

1252
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,450
ND the alphabets.

1253
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,450
瓦斯的瓦

1254
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,580
Anything wrong?

1255
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,580
不行膩

1256
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,830
ND... ND...

1257
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,830
瓦仔 · · ·

1258
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,370
See! She doesn't like it!

1259
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,370
你看它不要啦

1260
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,160
Why not?

1261
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,160
爲什麼不要

1262
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,120
Because you can't humiliate my idol!

1263
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,120
因爲你不可以這樣污衊我的偶像

1264
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,370
Besides, she's a girl! -ND!

1265
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,370
- 而且人家是少女 - 瓦仔

1266
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,660
I'm gonna rub some dog pee on your head.

1267
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,660
我拿尿摸你的頭哦

1268
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:15,580
- ND... - Hsu Taiyu!

1269
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:15,580
- 瓦仔 - 徐太宇

1270
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:20,450
(REPORT STRAY DOGS TO HAVE THEM CAUGHT.)

1271
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:20,450
好像真的被捕狗大隊抓走了

1272
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,580
It seems like he's really caught...

1273
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,580
昨天找了好久

1274
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,580
I looked for her everywhere...

1275
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,580
搞不好它被它主人找回去啦

1276
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,790
Maybe she's just taken back by her owner.

1277
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,790
值日生咧

1278
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,250
Who's on duty today?

1279
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,250
擦黑板啊

1280
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,250
Clean it up!

1281
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,250
我給你們方便你們當隨便啊

1282
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,250
You have no respect for your teacher...

1283
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,250
起立

1284
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,500
Stand up.

1285
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,500
不用了

1286
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,750
No need.

1287
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,750
是誰

1288
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,410
Who did this?

1289
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,410
拿這種無聊的東西來詛咒別人

1290
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:56,660
Cursing others with this silly stuff!

1291
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:56,660
等一下到我辦公室 自首

1292
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:05,290
Come to my office and turn yourself in.

1293
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:05,290
我不要求考託福

1294
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,660
Excuse me.

1295
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,660
報告

1296
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,580
You should at least take exams.

1297
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,580
至少你考試要出席嘛

1298
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,290
You don't remember what I said?

1299
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,290
老師的話都是從左耳進右耳出的嗎

1300
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:17,830
I got an anonymous letter saying you did it.

1301
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:17,830
有同學匿名舉發說幸運信是你寄來的

1302
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,450
You know.

1303
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,450
你知道

1304
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:20,790
I remain unmarried for so many years,

1305
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:20,790
我這麼多年沒有結婚

1306
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,040
devoting myself to you...

1307
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,040
犧牲奉獻給你

1308
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:22,450
I mean...

1309
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:22,450
不是

1310
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,620
to the school.

1311
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,620
給學校

1312
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,750
Can't you just do me a favor?

1313
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,750
你就不能給我個面子嗎

1314
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,540
It's ok.

1315
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,540
沒關係

1316
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,040
Tell me the truth...

1317
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,040
你說實話

1318
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,620
I'm very understanding.

1319
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,620
老師很開明的

1320
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:34,250
Listen...

1321
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:34,250
我告訴你哦

1322
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:36,450
If I find out that you're lying to me later,

1323
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:36,450
你如果現在說謊後來被發現

1324
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,080
I'll have no choice but to punish you.

1325
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,080
那老師就只好處罰你了

1326
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,580
I know who wrote it.

1327
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,580
我知道信是誰寫的

1328
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,410
Wrote what?

1329
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,410
什麼信

1330
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:44,450
Hsu Taiyu.

1331
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:44,450
徐太宇

1332
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,200
You...

1333
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,200
你

1334
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:50,410
I wrote it.

1335
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:50,410
是我寫的

1336
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,160
Very good.

1337
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,160
非常好

1338
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,370
Miss Lin.

1339
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,370
林同學

1340
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,660
You can go now.

1341
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,660
你回去

1342
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,160
Thank you.

1343
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,160
是

1344
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,700
I knew it!

1345
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,700
我就知道是你

1346
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:05,620
Hsu Taiyu.

1347
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:05,620
徐太宇

1348
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,620
I really wish it's not you again.

1349
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,620
枉費我一直對你存着一絲希望

1350
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:09,450
Hsu Taiyu.

1351
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:09,450
徐太宇

1352
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,290
我跟你講了一半你怎麼可以走開

1353
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,300
How can you leave in the middle of my talk?

1354
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:12,080
Ms. Chen.

1355
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:12,080
陳老師

1356
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:12,580
Let me punish him first.

1357
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:12,580
你先讓我罰他

1358
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,620
Mr. Wang, I haven't finished yet.

1359
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,620
王老師我這邊比較嚴重

1360
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:14,410
Let me scold him first.

1361
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:14,410
你讓我先罵他

1362
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,700
It's not a matter of...

1363
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,700
不是什麼比較嚴重還是

1364
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:18,370
No, I was in the middle of scolding him.

1365
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:18,370
沒有我剛剛講到一半我正在教訓他

1366
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,660
One thing at one time.

1367
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,660
一個一個來

1368
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:20,660
Don't rush.

1369
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:20,660
不要急

1370
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:22,410
You first.

1371
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:22,410
你先

1372
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,290
OK.

1373
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,290
好

1374
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:24,450
Hsu Taiyu.

1375
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:24,450
徐太宇

1376
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:26,580
Why do you think the school still took you in

1377
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:26,580
你覺得三年級才轉學

1378
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,790
even though it's your last year in high school?

1379
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,790
爲什麼一高還願意收你進來

1380
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:32,330
Because you were in science honors class.

1381
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:32,330
那是因爲你國中唸的是數理資優班

1382
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:34,830
Even attended Science Olympiad competition.

1383
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:34,830
還代表學校參加奧林匹亞的競賽

1384
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:36,620
What happened to you?

1385
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:36,620
爲什麼你現在會變成這樣

1386
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:40,830
Have you heard of "The Tortoise and the Hare"?

1387
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:40,830
聽過龜兔賽跑的故事嗎

1388
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:43,370
And "Eradicating the Three Scourges".

1389
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:43,370
還有改過自新的周處除三害

1390
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,250
Do you know who's "Zhou Chu"?

1391
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,250
周處知道是誰嗎

1392
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:46,660
Yeah.

1393
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:46,660
知道

1394
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,870
It's pronounced "Chu" not "Choo"...

1395
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,870
那個字念處哦 · · ·不是處哦

1396
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:58,540
Thank you.

1397
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:58,540
謝謝

1398
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,040
You...

1399
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,040
其實

1400
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,290
really didn't have to do that.

1401
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,290
你可以不用幫我頂罪的

1402
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,700
That's what a friend is for.

1403
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,700
朋友就是要講義氣啊

1404
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:05,790
It does me no harm anyway.

1405
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:05,790
我又沒差

1406
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:13,830
One chain letter to me...

1407
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:13,830
你一封信給我

1408
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,500
One to "Asshole"...

1409
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,500
一封信給王八蛋

1410
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,200
Two others taken away by me...

1411
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,200
兩封都被我沒收啦

1412
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,200
Who got the last one?

1413
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,200
你還有一封給誰

1414
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,500
Tao Minmin...

1415
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,500
陶敏敏

1416
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,290
I really regret for it.

1417
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,290
我也很後悔啊

1418
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:29,750
That's why...

1419
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:29,750
所以

1420
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,910
You should work hard to get her!

1421
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,910
你纔要好好追人家嘛

1422
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:34,660
Girls like her must have had

1423
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:34,660
像她這樣的女生啊

1424
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:36,290
enough of compliments.

1425
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:36,290
稱讚一定聽膩了

1426
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,040
Why not write bad things about her

1427
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,040
不如寫一下她的缺點

1428
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,330
to get her attention?

1429
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,330
吸引她的注意力

1430
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,790
For example...

1431
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,790
譬如說

1432
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:42,160
Thick waist...

1433
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:42,160
腰粗

1434
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,370
Huge butt...

1435
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,370
屁股大

1436
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,160
So fake when she talks...

1437
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,160
講話很假掰之類的

1438
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,040
You sure?

1439
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,040
你確定

1440
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:47,870
Yeah.

1441
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:47,870
嗯

1442
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,250
And conclude it with...

1443
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,250
然後最後再補一句

1444
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,750
But still...

1445

即使這樣

Don't quote lyrics if you have no good idea.

沒有靈感不要抄歌詞啦

1452
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,750
You can quote foreign poets' work.

1453
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,750
可以抄外國詩人的作品

1454
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:19,750
Who's gonna understand it?

1455
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:19,750
誰看得懂

1456
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:23,200
That's why it'll make you look mysterious.

1457
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:23,200
就是看不懂才覺得你高深莫測啊

1458

You sure?

1459
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:24,290
你確定

1460
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:25,910
Sure.

1461

我跟你說哦

1464
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:30,160
Girls are so difficult to understand.

1465
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:30,160
女生啊是很難捉摸地

1466

When we say nothing's wrong...

我們說沒事

1468
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,950
it means something's wrong.

1469
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,950
就是有事

1470
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:37,040
When we say it's ok,

1471
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:37,040
我們說沒關係

1472
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,330
it means it's not ok.

1473
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,330
就是有關係

1474
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,450
If we say...

1475
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,450
如果我們今天說

1476
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,160
I am fat...

1477
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,160
我很胖

1478
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,700
That means we hope you can tell us...

1479
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,700
那就代表她希望你對她說

1480
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:46,580
You're not fat at all.

1481
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:46,580
她一點都不胖

1482
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,450

1541
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:57,950
Ma Suyuan.

1542
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:57,950
馬思遠

1543
00:47:58,330 --> 00:47:58,950
Hsu Taiyu.

1544
00:47:58,330 --> 00:47:58,950
徐太宇

1545
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:03,120
Taiyu thought the accident wouldn't have.

1546
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:03,120
太宇覺得如果不是他答應跟阿遠比賽

1547
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:03,750
A-yuan.

1548
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:03,750
阿遠

1549
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:07,370
Happened, if he didn't take the challenge.

1550
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:07,370
或許意外就不會發生

1551
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,160
That was the last time

1552
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,160
從那天起

1553
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,330
I saw Hsu Taiyu,

1554
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,330
我就再也沒看過徐太宇

1555
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,790
before he transferred to First High.

1556
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,790
直到他轉學來到一高

1557
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:20,950
He became someone I don't know.

1558
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:20,950
變成了一個我不認識的人

1559
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:51,450
Why don't we meet at Ice Palace,

1560
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:51,450
幹嘛不去冰宮

1561
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:52,580
but here?

1562
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:52,580
約在這裏

1563
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:54,750
You feel embarrassed?

1564
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:54,750
怕丟臉

1565
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,330
Hsu Taiyu.

1566
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,330
徐太宇

1567
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:58,910
Let's have a race.

1568
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:58,910
我們來比賽

1569
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:01,250
The winner can make a request.

1570
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:01,250
贏的可以要求對方做一件事

1571
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:02,830
Whoever crosses that line first wins.

1572
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:02,830
誰先到那條線誰就贏

1573
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:51,790
You can never beat me.

1574
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:51,790
你贏不了我的啦

1575
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,540
Stop or you'll kill yourself.

1576
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,540
再這樣下去會摔死

1577
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,450
What's wrong with you?

1578
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,450
你吃錯藥啊

1579
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,330
When you saw me in the pool the other day,

1580
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,330
那天你看到我在游泳池裏

1581
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:38,660
were you afraid that I'd die like Su-yuan,

1582
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:38,660
你是不是怕我跟馬思遠一樣

1583
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:40,200
in front of your eyes.

1584
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:40,200
在你面前溺死

1585
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,160
Ouyang told me everything.

1586
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,160
歐陽告訴我了

1587
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,620
None of your business.

1588
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,620
幹你屁事啊

1589
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:52,750
Who are you to shout at me?

1590
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:52,750
你憑什麼兇我啊

1591
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:55,040
Who are you to hurt yourself like this?

1592
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:55,040
你憑什麼把自己搞成這個樣子

1593
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,790
It's also not easy for Ouyang, ok?

1594
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,790
歐陽也很難過好不好

1595
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:57,830
Ma Suyuan must be pissed off

1596
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:57,830
馬思遠也一定很不爽

1597
00:50:57,950 --> 00:50:59,660
to see the way you are now.

1598
00:50:57,950 --> 00:50:59,660
你變成現在這個樣子

1599
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:01,370
Don't make me beat you!

1600
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:01,370
不要以爲我不敢揍你哦

1601
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:11,580
Hsu Taiyu.

1602
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:11,580
徐太宇

1603
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:28,750
Hsu Taiyu.

1604
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:28,750
徐太宇

1605
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:30,950
If I could do it over again,

1606
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:30,950
如果剛剛重來一次

1607
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,620
I'd still have a race with you.

1608
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,620
我還是會和你比賽

1609
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:36,450
If A-yuan could do it over again,

1610
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:36,450
如果再重來一次

1611
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,200
he'd still go into the sea.

1612
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,200
阿遠還是下海

1613
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,160
But it's our own decision.

1614
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,160
可是這是我們的決定

1615
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:42,870
Not your responsibility.

1616
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:42,870
不用你來負責啊

1617
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,620
Hsu Taiyu.

1618
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,620
徐太宇

1619
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:19,330
You agreed that

1620
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:19,330
你剛答應過

1621
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,160
the winner can make a request.

1622
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,160
贏的人可以要求對方做一件事

1623
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,450
What do you want?

1624
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,450
什麼

1625
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:34,750
Can you...

1626
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:34,750
你可不可以

1627
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,160
be that Hsu Taiyu again?

1628
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,160
做回徐太宇

1629
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,330
Stand up!

1630
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,330
起立

1631
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:06,700
A...attention.

1632
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:06,700
敬 · · ·敬禮

1633
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:10,580
Good morning, sir.

1634
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:10,580
老師好

1635
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:15,660
Shut up!

1636
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:15,660
上課

1637
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:21,500
Hsu Taiyu.

1638
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:21,500
徐太宇同學

1639
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:22,790
Do you...

1640
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:22,790
你

1641
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:25,580
have any question?

1642
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:25,580
有什麼問題嗎

1643
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:26,910
Yes.

1644
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:26,910
有

1645
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,410
Which page are we at today?

1646
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,410
今天上第幾頁

1647
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,830
Chapter 7 on page 125.

1648
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,830
第一百二十五頁第七章

1649
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:42,660

1650
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:42,660
第二次世界大戰

1651
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:46,160
Hsu...

1652
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:46,160
徐同學

1653
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,540
You have

1654
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,540
你翻的是

1655
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,700
geography textbook in your hand.

1656
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,700

00:54:58,330 --> 00:54:59,080

00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,330
第一百二十五頁

1661
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,580
Take your textbook out!

1662
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,580
課本拿出來啦

1663
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:09,750
Those who don't have it...

1664
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:09,750
沒帶課本的

1665
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:11,370
go and sit next to those who do.

1666
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:11,370
找有課本的一起看

1667
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:53,250
Am I cute?

1668
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:53,250
我可愛嗎

1669
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:22,160
Wow!

1670
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:22,160
哇塞

1671
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,330
Miss.

1672
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,330
小姐

1673
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:25,700
You look familiar...

1674
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:25,700
你有點面熟

1675
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:29,620
You are my high school...

1676
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:29,620
你是我的高中

1677
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:30,790
teacher.

1678
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:30,790
老師

1679
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:33,750
What's wrong with you today?

1680
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:33,750
你今天干嘛

1681
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:34,910
Going to temple festival?

1682
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:34,910
要去廟會哦

1683
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,290
Not really.

1684
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,290
沒有啦

1685
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:37,410
I...

1686
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:37,410
我

1687
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:40,580
Hurry up!

1688
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:40,580
快點啦

1689
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,620
We need to secure our seats at McDonald's!

1690
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,620
太晚去麥當勞會沒位子

1691
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:43,910
Temple festival is this way...

1692
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:43,910
廟會在那邊啦

1693
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:04,500
Look at that guy...

1694
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:04,500
你看那個男生

1695
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,250
- So cute... - Look, it's him...

1696
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,250
- 好帥哦 - 你看 就是他

1697
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:06,950
so tall.

1698
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:06,950
好高哦

1699
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:08,160
So cute...

1700
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:08,160
好帥哦

1701
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:25,580
You idiot.

1702
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:25,580
白癡哦

1703
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:27,330
Look where you're going.

1704
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:27,330
走路不看路

1705
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,370
You got a hole in your brain?

1706
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,370
腦袋有洞

1707
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,290
It's fine.

1708
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,290
沒關係啦

1709
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:41,790
Let's look for a seat first

1710
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:41,790
我們先上去找位子

1711
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:43,040
and order later.

1712
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:43,040
等一下 下來點餐

1713
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:43,910
You're gonna help me.

1714
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:43,910
你要幫我喔

1715
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:44,450
OK.

1716
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:44,450
好啦

1717
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,540
Here's what you ordered.

1718
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,540
你的餐點都已經到齊了

1719
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:45,830
Thanks.

1720
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:45,830
謝謝

1721
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:46,870
Have a nice meal.

1722
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:46,870
祝你用餐愉快

1723
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:48,120
Hello! Welcome!

1724
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:48,120
你好歡迎光臨

1725
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:49,120
What would you like to order?

1726
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:49,120
請問要點什麼

1727
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:52,580
Hsu Taiyu.

1728
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:52,580
徐太宇

1729
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:55,080
He's studying there.

1730
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:55,080
他在那邊溫書耶

1731
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,700
It seems like he really changed.

1732
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,700
看來他真的轉性羅

1733
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:00,450
Maybe he's here...

1734
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:00,450
搞不好啊

1735
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:03,290
because you come here often.

1736
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:03,290
他是因爲你常來這裏他纔來的呀

1737
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,790
- Let's go... - What?

1738
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,790
- 走啦 -  幹嘛啦

1739
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:09,040
Hey, she wants to talk to you.

1740
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:09,040
欵 她有話跟你說

1741
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,580
I'll find us a table.

1742
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,580
我先去佔位子

1743
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:13,250
That seat is...

1744
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:13,250
那個位子

1745
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:14,410
Hsu...

1746
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:14,410
徐同學

1747
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:17,500
I heard you were in science honors class...

1748
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:17,500
聽說你以前是資優班的

1749
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:19,660
If that's the case,

1750
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:19,660
如果是這樣的話

1751
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:21,540
you should never give up.

1752
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:21,540
你千萬不要放棄

1753
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:23,660
If there's something you don't understand,

1754
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:23,660
課業上如果有什麼問題

1755
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:24,830
I can help you with it.

1756
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:24,830
我可以幫你

1757
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:26,660
Thanks.

1758
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:26,660
謝啦

1759
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:29,620
You asked me to give you my personal info.

1760
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:29,620
你之前要我回的個人檔案

1761
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:30,750
You'll have it.

1762
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:30,750
我會回

1763
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:32,790
But...

1764
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:32,790
但是

1765
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:35,950
Don't mistake "Disney" for "Destiny" again.

1766
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:35,950
下次不要再把"緣"寫成"綠" 了

1767
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,500
Why "Destiny"?

1768
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,500
什麼緣啊

1769
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:43,700
Disney is my pseudonym.

1770
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:43,700
綠是我的筆名啊

1771
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:54,790
What... were you... talking about?

1772
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:54,790
剛 敏敏 找你幹嘛

1773
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,450
Nothing. They wanted to share the table.

1774
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,450
沒幹嘛 想並桌

1775
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:01,910
Study.

1776
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:01,910
讀書啊

1777
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:15,160
Hsu Taiyu started to study hard.

1778
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:15,160
徐太宇開始認真唸書

1779
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:16,870
Very hard.

1780
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:16,870
很認真

1781
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,950
Although I think it's because I woke him up,

1782
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,950
雖然很想把這歸功於我打醒他

1783
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:23,500
the truth is...

1784
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:23,500
但事實是

1785
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:25,450
he did it for Minmin.

1786
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:25,450
他爲了敏敏

1787
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:26,620
He wants to get into top 10

1788
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:26,620
這次模擬考

1789
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,660
in the coming mock exam.

1790
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,660
他想考進英雄榜

1791
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:30,910
Hsu Taiyu.

1792
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:30,910
徐太宇

1793
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,160
Did he come to see you?

1794
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,160
他該不會是來看你的吧

1795
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:39,200
Back then...

1796
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:39,200
在那個年代

1797
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:40,080
if a girl

1798
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:40,080
一個女生

1799
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,290
was willing to give you her personal info,

1800
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,290
願意回你她的個人資料

1801
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:43,450
that means...

1802
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:43,450
就代表

1803
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,330
she didn't dislike you at all.

1804
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,330
她對你還算有一點點好感

1805
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:49,250
(THE PERSON I LIKE:)

1806
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:56,200
Latest version of sample exams, good luck.

1807
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:56,200
這最新的考古題 考試加油

1808
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,080
Thank you.

1809
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,080
謝謝

1810
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,910
Thank you.

1811
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,910
會的 謝謝老闆

1812
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:05,620
Ah.

1813
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:05,620
啊

1814
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,160
It's my hubby.

1815
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,160
我的老公耶

1816
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:11,750
When I grow up.

1817
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:11,750
我長大以後啊

1818
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:14,750
I will go to Taipei for your concert...

1819
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:14,750
一定要去臺北看你的演唱會

1820
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:16,700
A piece of cake.

1821
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:16,700
那有什麼難的

1822
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:18,910
One day I'll ask Andy Lau

1823
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:18,910
以後我叫劉德華

1824
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:20,370
to sing for you.

1825
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:20,370
唱給你聽

1826
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:22,830
Really?

1827
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:22,830
真的

1828
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:24,330
Yeah right.

1829
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:24,330
最好是啦

1830
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:25,620
Hey! Don't touch it!

1831
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:25,620
喂 不要碰

1832
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:27,200
Let's go.

1833
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:27,200
快走

1834
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:33,160
Let's go.

1835
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:33,160
快走

1836
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,330
If we add the two together...

1837
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,330
這兩個加在一起

1838
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:41,410
Idiot.

1839
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:41,410
笨蛋

1840
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:46,370
Sin^2(X) + cos^2(X) = 1.

1841
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:46,370
Sin X絕對值平方加Cos X絕對值平方

1842
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,660
No exception.

1843
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,660
永遠等於一

1844
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:50,330
What?

1845
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:50,330
嗯

1846
01:00:57,410 --> 01:00:58,580
Look behind you.

1847
01:00:57,410 --> 01:00:58,580
看後面

1848
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:03,160
Wow... when did Truly become so serious?

1849
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:03,160
哇 林真心什麼時候變那麼認真

1850
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:05,750
Something's wrong with Boss... hehe.

1851
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:05,750
老大怪怪的哦

1852
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:23,250
I live just down there.

1853
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:23,250
我家就在前面

1854
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:25,080
It's quite late.

1855
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:25,080
已經很晚了

1856
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,500
You should go home now.

1857
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,500
你先走啦

1858
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:28,160
Oh...

1859
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:28,160
哦

1860
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:30,290
It's ok.

1861
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:30,290
沒關係啊

1862
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:31,540
If I linger a bit,

1863
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:31,540
再一下

1864
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:32,950
I might run into Tao Minmin.

1865
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:32,950
搞不好會遇到陶敏敏

1866
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:36,790
Oh...

1867
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:36,790
哦

1868
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,160
By the way.

1869
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,160
對了

1870
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:43,370
ND already learned to pee at the same spot.

1871
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:43,370
瓦仔 現在已經會在固定的地方尿尿了

1872
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,700
Thank God...

1873
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,700
謝天謝地

1874
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,750
she didn't grow into an idiot like you.

1875
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,750
幸好沒被你養笨

1876
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:07,660
For me?

1877
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:07,660
送我啊

1878
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:12,450
I planned to give it to Tao Minmin.

1879
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:12,450
本來是要送陶敏敏的

1880
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:15,250
But it's so ugly and it's Andy Lau...

1881
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:15,250
但是這麼醜又是劉德華

1882
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:17,370
better give it to you.

1883
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:17,370
跟你比較配

1884
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:25,660
Hey...

1885
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:25,660
那個

1886
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:27,200

1887
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:27,200
我問你哦

1888
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:31,330
what's the definition of pretty girls?

1889
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:31,330
男生 到底覺得什麼樣的女生漂亮

1890
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:35,410
You mean what kind of girls Ouyang likes?

1891
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:35,410
你想問歐陽喜歡怎麼樣的女生吧

1892
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:38,750
Whatever.

1893
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:38,750
隨便啦

1894
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:40,160
Anything.

1895
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:40,160
都可以

1896
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:44,370
He was crazy about Vivian Chow before.

1897
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:44,370
他以前很迷周慧敏

1898
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:47,790
What about you?

1899
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:47,790
那你呢

1900
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:52,160
Uchida Yuki is not bad.

1901
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:52,160
內田有紀還不錯

1902
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:53,410
Sakai Noriko also.

1903
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:53,410
還有酒井法子

1904
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:55,790
Both Japanese?

1905
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:55,790
都日本女生哦

1906
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:57,330
Yes.

是

1908
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:03,540
I want to learn roller skating.

1909
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:03,540
我最近想學溜冰

1910
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:05,620
Why so sudden?

1911
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:05,620
幹嘛突然想學

1912
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:07,660
Because...

1913
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:07,660
就 · · ·

1914
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:10,700
Ouyang says he likes roller skating.

1915
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:10,700
歐陽說他喜歡溜冰啊

1916
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:14,250
You're pretty good... can you teach me?

1917
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:14,250
你那麼厲害 可以教我嗎

1918
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:16,660
Sure.

1919
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:16,660
好啊

1920
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,160
I want this.

1921
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,160
這個

1922
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:33,790
Hello, Mr. Tang.

1923
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:33,790
湯叔叔好

1924
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:56,250
Should I ask my bro to come down?

1925
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:56,250
要不要幫你叫我哥下來

1926
01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:10,580
Where can I get the same look as yours?

1927
01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:10,580
去哪裏才能弄得跟你一樣啊

1928
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:15,540
Go to hell and get reborn will be easier.

1929
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:15,540
去地獄重新投胎比較快啦

1930
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:21,700
Lin Truly, are you hitting puberty?

1931
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:21,700
林真心 你思春哦

1932
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:23,370
Don't be so mean.

1933
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:23,370
你很壞

1934
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:26,580
It's normal for girls to care their looks.

1935
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:26,580
小女生都想要變漂亮啊

1936
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:28,790
Let me help you.

1937
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:28,790
姐姐幫你

1938
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:31,950
Thank you sis.

1939
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:31,950
謝謝大嫂

1940
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,580
Are you alright?

1941
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,580
你還好嗎

1942
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:39,410
Yeah, sprained my ankle, that's all.

1943
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:39,410
沒事只是練球扭到而已

1944
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,410
Just need to ice it a bit.

1945
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,410
冰敷一下就好了

1946
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:46,160
Ouyang got injured. Does Truly know?

1947
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:46,160
歐陽受傷了 真心知道嗎

1948
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:47,120
I don't know...

1949
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:47,120
不知道

1950
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,580
Let's tell her when she's here.

1951
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,580
等她來我們趕快去跟她講好了

1952
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:52,160
Hey hey.

1953
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:52,160
奇怪

1954
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:55,290
Are you close friends of Ouyang's?

1955
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:55,290
歐陽跟你們很熟嗎

1956
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,080
Ouyang!

1957
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,080
歐陽

1958
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,790
- Chiayi, you... - Calm down.

1959
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,790
- 沈家儀你真的 - 息怒 · · ·

1960
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:02,910
Are you alright?

1961
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:02,910
你還好吧

1962
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:04,700
Yeah.

1963
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:04,700
還好

1964
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:58,750
Wow it swells so much.

1965
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:58,750
哇這腫得很厲害

1966
01:05:58,870 --> 01:06:01,250
No way, we must heat it.

1967
01:05:58,870 --> 01:06:01,250
不行 這一定要熱敷一下

1968
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,080
Ice it.

1969
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,080
是冰敷啦

1970
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:06,500
Heat it! Were you there in health class?

1971
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:06,500
是熱敷啦 你有沒有在上健康教育

1972
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:18,330
Hey...

1973
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:18,330
這個

1974
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:21,080
I always ice with this when I'm injured.

1975
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:21,080
我受傷的時候都用這個冰敷

1976
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,500
Convenient and tasty.

1977
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,500
方便又好吃

1978
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:26,250
Thanks.

1979
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:26,250
謝啦

1980
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:27,950
看樣子我不用去保健室了

1981
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:28,050
Guess I don't have to visit health center.

1982
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:32,160
I'll go back to class now.

1983
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:32,160
我先去上課

1984
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,790
You look cute today.

1985
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,790
今天滿可愛的

1986
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,500
The hairstyle suits you.

1987
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,500
這髮型很適合你

1988
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,370
Good luck with your exam.

1989
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,370
段考加油

1990
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,660
Wow!

1991
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,660
哇

1992
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:51,200
So cute.

1993
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:51,200
可愛哦

1994
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:53,910
Lin Truly, you are so pretty.

1995
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:53,910
林真心你好漂亮哦

1996
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:56,040
I want to look like you!

1997
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:56,040
我也想跟你一樣

1998
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,620
He said you're cute!

1999
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,620
被稱讚羅

2000
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:59,620
Did you put on makeup?

2001
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:59,620
你是不是有化妝啊

2002
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:10,330
Hsu Taiyu got 10th place in the mock exam

2003
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:10,330
那次三年級模擬考

2004
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:12,830
among all 3rd year students.

2005
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:12,830
徐太宇進了英雄榜第十名

2006
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:15,120
While the whole school was still in shock,

2007
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:15,120
在全校爲他震驚時

2008
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:16,950
the new director arrived.

2009
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:16,950
新的訓導主任來了

2010
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:21,620
Littering.

2011
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:21,620
亂丟垃圾

2012
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:24,540
Which eye of yours saw that I littered?

2013
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:24,540
你哪隻眼睛看到我亂丟垃圾

2014
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:26,200
You are the litter.

2015
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:26,200
你就是垃圾

2016
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:28,200
Director Chuan said...

2017
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:28,200
全主任說

2018
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:30,080
Everyone in class 317...

2019
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:30,080
你們317的人

2020
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,790
is a piece of shit.

2021
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,790
都是垃圾

2022
01:07:34,370 --> 01:07:35,500
Fuck! What the hell!

2023
01:07:34,370 --> 01:07:35,500
靠北哦

2024
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:39,370
School regulation says "no hair coloring".

2025
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:39,370
校規明訂 禁止學生染髮

2026
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:42,330
The new director hates people who break the rules.

2027
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:42,330
我們全主任最討厭破壞校規的人

2028
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:46,410
Excuse me.

2029
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:46,410
報告

2030
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:04,370
Hsu Taiyu from class 317.

2031
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:04,370
317的徐太宇

2032
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,500
Finally.

2033
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,500
終於見面了

2034
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:11,200
You'd better be good until you graduate.

2035
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:11,200
你最好在畢業之前安分一點

2036
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:13,660
Otherwise I'll kick you out of the school

2037
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:13,660
否則三大過一滿

2038
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:16,040
once you're cited with 3 serious demerits.

2039
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:16,040
我一定退你學

2040
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,290
As you wish.

2041
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,290
退就退啊

2042
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:23,370
I'll do my best.

2043
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:23,370
我會盡力而爲

2044
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:26,750
Because people like you

2045
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:26,750
因爲像你們這種人

2046
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:30,580
do not deserve education at all.

2047
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:30,580
根本就不配受教育

2048
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:55,950
Stand up.

2049
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:55,950
起立

2050
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:03,200
Who got first place in the exam this time?

2051
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:03,200
你們班這次段考第一名的同學是誰

2052
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:04,160
Please stand up.

2053
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:04,160
請起立

2054
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,160
Let's give him a big hand.

2055
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,160
大家掌聲鼓勵

2056
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:23,660
Good job.

2057
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:23,660
真的很厲害

2058
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:25,790
So good that I have to ask Hsu...

2059
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:25,790
厲害到我想請問一下徐同學

2060
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:29,620
how did you cheat in the exam?

2061
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:29,620
這次考試你是怎麼作弊來的

2062
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:33,870
I asked people to give you a big hand

2063
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:33,870
我剛纔叫大家鼓掌

2064
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:36,870
to see if you know what is shame!

2065
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:36,870
是想看看你有沒有羞恥心

2066
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:42,620
You just talked, stand up!

2067
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:42,620
那位講話的同學站起來

2068
01:09:45,370 --> 01:09:46,250
Sir.

2069
01:09:45,370 --> 01:09:46,250
報告主任

2070
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:47,040
I didn't talk.

2071
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:47,040
我沒有講話

2072
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,250
I have eyes to judge that.

2073
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,250
有沒有講話我自己有眼睛看

2074
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:52,250
Did you help him...

2075
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:52,250
這次考試

2076
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,450
in the exam?

2077
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,450
你有沒有幫忙他

2078
01:09:58,290 --> 01:10:00,410
Can someone come forward and testify that.

2079
01:09:58,290 --> 01:10:00,410
有哪位同學可以出來作證

2080
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,200
Hsu Taiyu cheated.

2081
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,200
徐太宇作弊

2082
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:07,200
No one wants to tell the truth, huh?

2083
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:07,200
沒有人肯說實話是不是

2084
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:09,830
Now...

2085
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:09,830
現在

2086
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:12,830
All of you, go to the running track.

2087
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:12,830
全班到操場跑步

2088
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:13,750
Stand up!

2089
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:13,750
起立

2090
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:16,290
I know you dislike me...

2091
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:16,290
你看我不順眼

2092
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:17,580
but it has nothing to do with them!

2093
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:17,580
幹他們屁事啊

2094
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:18,660
Leave them alone.

2095
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:18,660
要罰就罰我一個

2096
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:19,540
Fine.

2097
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:19,540
好

2098
01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:21,580
Want to play the hero?

2099
01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:21,580
愛逞英雄嘛

2100
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:25,660
I'll leave all 50 rounds to you.

2101
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:25,660
那就五十圈都讓你跑

2102
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:27,160
Run to your heart's content.

2103
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:27,160
跑個夠

2104
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:43,580
Director Chuan must be sick. So strict.

2105
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:43,580
全主任有病吧 服儀抓這麼嚴

2106
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:46,370
Demerit for skirts above the knees.

2107
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:46,370
對啊 裙子沒到膝下就被記過

2108
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,160
A lap is 400 meters!

2109
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,160
這一圈有四百公尺

2110
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:51,250
I heard that Hsu already finished 35 rounds.

2111
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:51,250
對啊 他已經跑第三十五圈了

2112
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,500
I heard that he cheated in the exam

2113
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,500
聽說徐太宇考試作弊

2114
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:02,700
and started a battle with the director.

2115
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:02,700
跟主任槓上了

2116
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:04,410
He's punished to run 50 rounds.

2117
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:04,410
所以被罰跑操場五十圈

2118
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:05,910
He's not that kind of person.

2119
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:05,910
他纔不是那種人

2120
01:11:06,450 --> 01:11:08,410
Minmin, Chiayi is bullshiting.

2121
01:11:06,450 --> 01:11:08,410
陶敏敏你不要聽沈家儀亂講

2122
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,450
Lin Truly...

2123
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,450
林真心

2124
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:12,830
Hsu Taiyu.

2125
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:12,830
徐太宇

2126
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:14,790
Why don't you tell the truth?

2127
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:14,790
你爲什麼不說實話

2128
01:11:16,790 --> 01:11:18,200
Hsu Taiyu!

2129
01:11:16,790 --> 01:11:18,200
徐太宇

2130
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:27,830
Excuse me.

2131
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:27,830
借過一下

2132
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:29,500
Director.

2133
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:29,500
主任

2134
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:31,450
Hsu Taiyu really didn't cheat.

2135
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:31,450
徐太宇同學真的沒有作弊

2136
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:32,620
I can testify for him.

2137
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:32,620
我可以作證

2138
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:34,080
He really studied very hard.

2139
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:34,080
他真的很努力的唸書

2140
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,250
You should stay away from people like him.

2141
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,250
你們升學班的最好少跟那種人混在一起

2142
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:39,330
Tell him,

2143
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:39,330
告訴他

2144
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,830
if he can't finish, 1 more demerit for him.

2145
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,830
今天要是沒跑完我一定記他一支大過

2146
01:11:41,950 --> 01:11:43,750
Plus one-week suspension from school.

2147
01:11:41,950 --> 01:11:43,750
外加禁學一個禮拜

2148
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:45,830
Let him reflect on himself at home.

2149
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:45,830
讓他在家好好反省

2150
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:12,790
How's your boss doing?

2151
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:12,790
你們老大現在還好嗎

2152
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:14,540
Dunno...

2153
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:14,540
不知道

2154
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:16,830
He doesn't answer on his pager.

2155
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:16,830
call機他都沒回

2156
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,500
I heard that the school festival next week

2157
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,500
聽說下禮拜校慶

2158
01:12:19,790 --> 01:12:21,450
might be cancelled by the director.

2159
01:12:19,790 --> 01:12:21,450
主任想要取消耶

2160
01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:24,660
He said we students don't study enough.

2161
01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:24,660
是說什麼學生太沉迷外務

2162
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,580
What the fuck is he thinking!

2163
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,580
聽他放屁啊

2164
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,410
Students also deserve human rights!

2165
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,410
學生就不能夠有人權嗎

2166
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:30,660
The authority shouldn't let him bully us!

2167
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:30,660
學校怎麼可以讓他這樣欺負我們

2168
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:34,580
Of course not!

2169
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:34,580
當然不可以

2170
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:39,370
We'll let the authority hear our voice

2171
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:39,370
下個禮拜校慶

2172
01:12:39,870 --> 01:12:41,580
at the school festival next week.

2173
01:12:39,870 --> 01:12:41,580
要讓學校聽到我們的聲音

2174
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:44,160
Let him know he can't do whatever he likes.

2175
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:44,160
讓主任知道他不能爲所欲爲

2176
01:12:44,290 --> 01:12:45,250
Let's do it!

2177
01:12:44,290 --> 01:12:45,250
好

2178
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,410
Sorry.

2179
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,410
不好意思

2180
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:11,500
- Please stand up for our rights - Please.

2181
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:11,500
-  同學  站出來 - 麻煩你  拜託

2182
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,750
Please, the revolt needs your support.

2183
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,750
同學 一高起義需要你的支持

2184
01:13:13,870 --> 01:13:15,700
The revolt needs your support.

2185
01:13:13,870 --> 01:13:15,700
一高起義需要你的支持

2186
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:17,830
Please have a look...

2187
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:17,830
同學 · · ·請看一下 · · ·

2188
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:20,580
Please, please have a look.

2189
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:20,580
同學 · · ·看一下

2190
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:21,660
Please support First High's revolt.

2191

一高起義請支持

2192
01:13:21,790 --> 01:13:23,540
Please support First High's revolt.

2193

一高起義請多支持

2194
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:26,290
Please, please have a look.

2195
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:26,290
同學 · · ·你看一下

2196
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:28,540
We really really

2197
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:28,540
你們的支持

2198
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:30,580
need your support.

2199
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:30,580
對我們真的很重要

2200
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:34,790
Don't take it.

2201
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:34,790
不要啦

2202
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:37,370
You're done if the director knows.

2203
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:37,370
被主任知道就完了耶

2204
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:46,790
Leave it to me.

2205
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:46,790
交給我

2206
01:13:49,870 --> 01:13:52,540
Hand it out over there. You, there.

2207
01:13:49,870 --> 01:13:52,540
你去發那邊 你去那邊

2208
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:11,040
You're openly instigating others to revolt,

2209
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:11,040
你這是公然煽動同學

2210
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:12,450
violating the regulations,

2211
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:12,450
違綱亂紀

2212
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:13,450
humiliating your teachers.

2213
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:13,450
侮辱師長

2214
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:16,950
Everyone who helped you now has a demerit.

2215
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:16,950
你害那些幫你的同學現在全部都被記過了

2216
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:19,540
Do your parents know what you're doing?

2217
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:19,540
你爸媽知道你幹這事兒嗎

2218
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,450
You brought disgrace on your parents.

2219
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,450
你讓父母蒙羞

2220
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:23,500
You brought shame on them.

2221
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:23,500
你丟你爸媽的臉

2222
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:27,830
The teacher said Hsu is a gangster.

2223
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:27,830
老師說那個徐太宇是流氓學生耶

2224
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:30,910
He's not even allowed to go to school!

2225
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:30,910
學校不讓他上學你看他有多壞

2226
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,040
You completely destroyed my reputation.

2227
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,040
我的臉都被你丟光了啦

2228
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:34,830
You... go upstairs and write your confession.

2229
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:34,830
你 · · ·現在給我上去寫悔過書

2230
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:36,290
You're grounded for two days.

2231
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:36,290
兩天不準出門

2232
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:37,620
Now!

2233
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:37,620
現在

2234
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:43,450
How embarrassing.

2235
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:43,450
真是丟人現眼

2236
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:45,790
I was scolded by the teacher on the phone.

2237
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:45,790
老師今天打電話來我就站在這裏給他罵耶

2238
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:46,870
I...

2239
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:46,870
我

2240
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:49,250
- Hello? - This is Truly's cram school.

2241
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:49,250
- 喂 - 我是林真心的補習班

2242
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:50,870
Lin Truly is busy now.

2243
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:50,870
林真心沒空啦

2244
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:53,330
Hey...

2245
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:53,330
欵

2246
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:55,160
It's a guy...

2247
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:55,160
男生耶

2248
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:57,620
Hello?

2249
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:57,620
喂

2250
01:14:57,950 --> 01:14:59,080
It's you again!

2251
01:14:57,950 --> 01:14:59,080
又是你

2252
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,790
Never call again!

2253
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,790
以後不準打電話來

2254
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:06,660
You are so rude.

2255
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:06,660
你這個人怎麼那麼沒有教養啊

2256
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:08,830
If he calls again, let me pick it up.

2257
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:08,830
如果再打來我接

2258
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:10,160
Must be him.

2259
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:10,160
一定是他

2260
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:11,580
Pretending to be cram school staff.

2261
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:11,580
裝補習班

2262
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:17,660
Lin Truly.

2263
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:17,660
林真心

2264
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:20,410
Don't call me these two days.

2265
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:20,410
這兩天你先不要打電話過來

2266
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:21,410
What's wrong?

2267
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:21,410
怎麼了

2268
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:22,330
What happened?

2269
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:22,330
發生什麼事

2270
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:24,410
Nothing's wrong. Bye.

2271
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:24,410
我沒事 先這樣

2272
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:01,330
Are you ok?

2273
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:01,330
沒事吧

2274
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:05,580
It's so late... you must be going to bed?

2275
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:05,580
這麼晚 你應該要睡了吧

2276
01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:13,200
I'm just stopping by.

2277
01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:13,200
我只是剛好經過

2278
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:26,370
Well...

2279
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:26,370
那

2280
01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:29,620
I'm leaving then.

2281
01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:29,620
我走羅

2282
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:31,580
Hold on.

2283
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:31,580
你等一下

2284
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:39,700
ND.

2285
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:39,700
瓦仔

2286
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:45,790
ND.

2287
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:45,790
瓦仔

2288
01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:55,160
Are you alright?

2289
01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:55,160
你還好嗎

2290
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:59,040
Never knew I can be suspended from school.

2291
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:59,040
第一次知道可以被禁學不用上課

2292
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,250
Feels awesome.

2293
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,250
超爽

2294
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,370
I mean... you passed out at school...

2295
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,370
我是說 那天在學校昏倒

2296
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:07,620
It's just heat stroke.

2297
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:07,620
中暑而已啊

2298
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:08,790
Nothing fatal.

2299
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:08,790
又不會死

2300
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:20,370
Why are you suddenly grounded?

2301
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:20,370
你怎麼突然被禁足

2302
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:26,370
Anyone can be grounded for knowing you, ok?

2303
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:26,370
任何人被發現認識你都會被禁足 好嗎

2304
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:32,580
What brought you here?

2305
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:32,580
你怎麼會來啊

2306
01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:33,910
Because you said...

2307
01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:33,910
因爲你說過

2308
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:38,160
When a girl says "I'm ok", she's not ok.

2309
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:38,160
女生說沒關係就是有關係

2310
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:40,870
Nothing's wrong means something's wrong.

2311
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:40,870
我沒事 就是有事啊

2312
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:48,580
Do you want to come to a place with me?

2313
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:48,580
要不要去一個地方

2314
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:50,580
What?

2315
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:50,580
蛤

2316
01:17:58,370 --> 01:17:59,870
Wait here.

2317
01:17:58,370 --> 01:17:59,870
你在這裏等我一下

2318
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:27,040
Since I discovered this place,

2319
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:27,040
我發現這裏以後

2320
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:28,910
I've been coming here at midnight a lot.

2321
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:28,910
就常常半夜來溜

2322
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:34,250
You want to learn roller skating, right?

2323
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:34,250
你不是想學溜冰

2324
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:45,500
Let me tell you how not to fall.

2325
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:45,500
告訴你不要摔倒的祕訣是什麼

2326
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:47,540
What's the tip?

2327
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:47,540
是什麼

2328
01:18:48,450 --> 01:18:49,450
Don't...

2329
01:18:48,450 --> 01:18:49,450
就是

2330
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:51,250
be afraid of falling.

2331
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:51,250
不要怕摔倒

2332
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:09,410
It can't get worse than falling.

2333
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:09,410
最慘就是摔倒而已

2334
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,410
The important thing is...

2335
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,410
重要的是

2336
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:12,830
why are you here.

2337
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:12,830
你爲什麼來這裏

2338
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:24,790
Thank you.

2339
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:24,790
謝謝

2340
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:26,700
What?

2341
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:26,700

01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:06,580
以上九位同學上臺領獎

2392
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:11,660
You might be wondering...

2393
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:11,660
你們可能覺得很奇怪

2394
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:13,450
why there are only 9 of them.

2395
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:13,450
爲什麼沒有第十名

2396
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:15,580
Because...

2397
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:15,580
因爲

2398
01:21:16,370 --> 01:21:19,540
the school denounces cheating in exams.

2399
01:21:16,370 --> 01:21:19,540
學校嚴厲譴責考試作弊的行爲

2400
01:21:20,290 --> 01:21:23,200
We human beings must have a sense of shame.

2401
01:21:20,290 --> 01:21:23,200
做人要有羞恥心

2402
01:21:24,450 --> 01:21:25,540
You should never think those sneaky,

2403
01:21:24,450 --> 01:21:25,540
不要以爲偷雞摸狗

2404
01:21:25,660 --> 01:21:27,040
shameful behavior of yours

2405
01:21:25,660 --> 01:21:27,040
幹了不要臉的事情

2406
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:28,660
will not be found out.

2407
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:28,660
不會被發現

2408
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:33,290
Hsu of Class 317, I'm talking about YOU.

2409
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:33,290
三年十七班徐太宇我說的就是你

2410
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:35,160
What rubbish?

2411
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:35,160
胡說什麼

2412
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:37,790
Mind your own business!

2413
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:37,790
看什麼

2414
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:54,750
Sir.

2415
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:54,750
報告

2416
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:12,080
We're giving out awards now,

2417
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:12,080
這位同學

2418
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,450
if you want to talk, we'll...

2419
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,450
我們現在要頒獎 有什麼事情我們到 · · ·

2420
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:15,410
Director.

2421
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:15,410
主任

2422
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:19,160
I have something serious to report now.

2423
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:19,160
我有非常嚴重的事情必須立刻報告

2424
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:22,660
My skirt is 3cm higher than my knee.

2425
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:22,660
我的裙子比膝下短三公分

2426
01:22:22,790 --> 01:22:24,410
My socks are not 100% white.

2427
01:22:22,790 --> 01:22:24,410
襪子沒有全白

2428
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:27,290
My jacket's zipper never pulled high enough.

2429
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:27,290
外套拉鍊從來沒有拉到學號高度

2430
01:22:27,410 --> 01:22:28,040
Please punish me, sir.

2431
01:22:27,410 --> 01:22:28,040
請主任處份

2432
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:29,750
All these are not important now.

2433
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:29,750
現在這些不重要

2434
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:34,250
We'll take our time to punish her later.

2435
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:34,250
待會我們再來好好處罰這位同學

2436
01:22:35,410 --> 01:22:36,750
If none of these rules is important,

2437
01:22:35,410 --> 01:22:36,750
如果這些都不重要

2438
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:38,580
why should we follow them?

2439
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:38,580
我們爲什麼要遵守

2440
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:40,830
Therefore,

2441
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:40,830
所以

2442
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:42,700
please cite me with an admonition

2443
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:42,700
根據校規

2444
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:44,950
according to school regulations.

2445
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:44,950
請記我警告

2446
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:03,580
Director.

報告主任

2448
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,250
I cheated in exams.

2449
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,250
我作弊

2450
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:11,660
Please cite me with a major demerit

2451
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:11,660
考試舞弊根據校規必須記大過

2452
01:23:11,790 --> 01:23:13,250
according to school regulations.

2453
01:23:11,790 --> 01:23:13,250
請主任處分

2454
01:23:13,370 --> 01:23:14,370
Ouyang.

2455
01:23:13,370 --> 01:23:14,370
歐陽同學

2456
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:16,750
Don't play with your future.

2457
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:16,750
不要拿自己的前途開玩笑

2458
01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:18,830
You're applying for Taiwan University,

2459
01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:18,830
尤其你申請臺大保送

2460
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:20,330
Your discipline record can't be affected.

2461
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:20,330
操行不能受影響

2462
01:23:20,450 --> 01:23:21,580
Besides, we know very well. You're smart.

2463
01:23:20,450 --> 01:23:21,580
況且學校很清楚

2464
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:22,660
It's not possible that you...

2465
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:22,660
依你的實力不可能

2466
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:24,370
Why not?

2467
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:24,370
爲什麼不可能

2468
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,580
If Director Chuan can say that Hsu Taiyu

2469
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,580
如果全主任可以說三年十七班

2470
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,450
of Class 317 cheated on the exam,

2471
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,450
徐太宇同學作弊

2472
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:29,580
I can say I did it.

2473
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:29,580
我現在說有

2474
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:31,160
And what I say counts.

2475
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:31,160
那就是有

2476
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:32,580
Alright.

2477
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:32,580
好

2478
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:36,790
Since Ouyang confessed his crime bravely,

2479
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:36,790
既然歐陽同學有勇氣自首

2480
01:23:36,910 --> 01:23:39,500
I'll make sure he gets a major demerit.

2481
01:23:36,910 --> 01:23:39,500
那我絕對嚴格執行記過

2482
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:43,370
Director Chuan...

2483
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:43,370
主任

2484
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,080
We need further discussion.

2485
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,080
這事還要再討論

2486
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:46,080
Principal, Ouyang just...

2487
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:46,080
校長 歐陽同學他

2488
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,620
Director.

2489
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,620
報告主任

2490
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,250
I'm in shorts while it's not a P.E. class.

2491
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,250
我在非體育課的時候穿短褲

2492
01:23:50,370 --> 01:23:51,790
Please cite me with an admonition.

2493
01:23:50,370 --> 01:23:51,790
請記我警告

2494
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:55,790

報告主任

2496
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:58,660
You're my chocolate.

2497
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:58,660
你是我的巧克力

2498
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:01,410
I'm disrespectful to teachers.

2499
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:01,410
我態度輕浮隨便

2500
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:02,870
Please cite me with an admonition.

2501
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:02,870
請記我警告

2502
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:07,370

報告主任

2504
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:09,540
I spread obscene ideas.

2505
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:09,540
我傳播猥褻思想

2506
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:11,580
Please cite me with a minor demerit.

2507
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:11,580
請記我一支小過吧

2508
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:16,450
Director.

2509
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:16,450
報告主任

2510
01:24:16,830 --> 01:24:18,370

你吃屎吧

2512
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:26,120
Sorry I humiliated teachers.

2513
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:26,120
對不起我侮辱師長

2514
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:28,160

報告主任

2518
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:33,370
I... I have a girlfriend.

2519
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:33,370
我 · · ·有女朋友

2520
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:35,580
Bullshit.

2521
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:35,580

2522
01:24:37,370 --> 01:24:38,500

我私帶BBCall到學校

2526
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,660
Please cite me with an admonition.

2527
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,660

2528
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:47,410

報告主任

2530
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:49,370
I didn't flush the toilet.

2531
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:49,370
我上廁所沒沖水

2532
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:50,750
Director.

2533
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:50,750
報告主任

2534
01:24:51,370 --> 01:24:52,620
I'm not wearing underpants.

2535

我沒穿內褲

2536
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:54,450
I play Game Boy in class.

2537
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:54,450
我上課打電動

2538
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:55,580
I sleep in class...

2539
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:55,580
我上課睡覺

2540
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:57,450
I have a boyfriend...

2541
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:57,450
我有男朋友

2542
01:25:18,410 --> 01:25:19,370

主任

2544
01:25:20,370 --> 01:25:22,370
You said students should be like students.

2545
01:25:20,370 --> 01:25:22,370
你說學生要有學生的樣子

2546
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:24,580
But neither exams nor school regulations

2547
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:24,580
但是分數和校規

2548
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,370
can define us.

2549
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,370
都不能定義我們

2550
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:29,410
Those with good scores can make mistakes.

2551
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:29,410
成績好的學生也會犯錯

2552
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:32,540
Those who made a mistake can improve.

2553
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:32,540
曾經犯錯的有一天也會變好

2554
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:35,500
Whether we're good or bad is not up to you.

2555
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:35,500
是好是壞不是你說了算

2556
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:37,660
Only we know who we are.

2557
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:37,660
只有我們自己知道我是誰

2558
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,790
Only we can decide the way we are.

2559
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,790
只有我們自己能決定自己的樣子

2560
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:50,950
Alright. Alright.

2561
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:50,950
好 好 好

2562
01:25:51,410 --> 01:25:52,830
Calm down everyone.

2563
01:25:51,410 --> 01:25:52,830
同學冷靜

2564
01:25:53,370 --> 01:25:57,750
Today is the 54th anniversary of our school.

2565
01:25:53,370 --> 01:25:57,750
今天是我們五十四週年校慶

2566
01:25:58,330 --> 01:26:02,370
First High is always a liberal school.

2567
01:25:58,330 --> 01:26:02,370
一高一直自詡是間自由開放的學校

2568
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:04,830
I'm here to promise you that, we'll discuss,

2569
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:04,830
校長在這邊承諾同學

2570
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:08,790
improve ourselves and proceed accordingly.

2571
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:08,790
會檢討改進做出相對的處理

2572
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:21,160
The long-waited water balloon fight

2573
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:21,160
那麼同學們期待已久的水球大戰

2574
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:23,620
officially starts now.

2575
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:23,620
現在正式開打

2576
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:43,910
We didn't know until years later...

2577
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:43,910
很多年以後我們才知道

2578
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,870
the first person you throw your balloon at,

2579
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,870
讓你第一個砸下水球的人

2580
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:48,950
is not someone you dislike,

2581
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:48,950
不是你討厭他

2582
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:53,580
but someone you can't take your eyes off.

2583
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:53,580
而是你的眼裏  只有他

2584
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:45,830
Hey! You meant it.

2585
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:45,830
喂 你很故意耶

2586
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:46,750
That's not true.

2587
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:46,750
沒有啊

2588
01:27:46,870 --> 01:27:49,370
Just to wait for Dahe and Small.

2589
01:27:46,870 --> 01:27:49,370
等一下大賀跟小隻嘛

2590
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:53,790
Are you tired?

2591
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:53,790
累不累

2592
01:28:07,290 --> 01:28:08,830
Just to keep your hands warm.

2593
01:28:07,290 --> 01:28:08,830
這樣手比較不會冷

2594
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:22,410
I picked your key.

2595
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:22,410
我鑰匙抽到你耶

2596
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:24,250
We must be meant for each other, right?

2597
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:24,250
我們是不是很有緣啊

2598
01:28:24,370 --> 01:28:25,540
Meant for hell.

2599
01:28:24,370 --> 01:28:25,540
緣你媽啦

2600
01:28:27,910 --> 01:28:28,790
You're going so slow on purpose...

2601
01:28:27,910 --> 01:28:28,790
你故意騎這麼慢

2602
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:31,290
is it because you want us to be alone?

2603
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:31,290
是不是爲了想要跟我獨處啊

2604
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:34,830
Boss...

2605
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:34,830
老大

2606
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:36,830
Sakuraki... wait for me!

2607
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:36,830
櫻木 等等我

2608
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:03,410
Follow the beat!

2609
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:03,410
不要搶拍

2610
01:29:05,830 --> 01:29:08,750
Truth or Dare.

2611
01:29:05,830 --> 01:29:08,750
真心話大冒險

2612
01:29:14,330 --> 01:29:15,620
Ouyang...

2613
01:29:14,330 --> 01:29:15,620
歐陽

2614
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:18,290
Are you seeing someone?

2615
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:18,290
你有沒有喜歡的人啊

2616
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:19,790
Is she here?

2617
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:19,790
在不在現場

2618
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:24,660
Yes, she's here.

2620

Wow! Mr. Straight-A confessed his love.

2621
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:28,290
哇  模範生表白了

2622
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,290
Boss, boss.

2623
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,290

她在現場嗎

2628
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:40,450
Yes, she's here.

2629
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:40,450
有 她在現場

2630
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:45,120

2631
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:45,120
誰啊

2632
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:46,450
Boss, tell me... please.

2633
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:46,450
好想知道老大

2634
01:29:46,580 --> 01:29:47,500
Hurry up...

2635
01:29:46,580 --> 01:29:47,500
快點

2636
01:29:48,870 --> 01:29:51,540
Oh... Lin Truly.

2637
01:29:48,870 --> 01:29:51,540
哦 林真心

2638
01:29:52,910 --> 01:29:54,370
Are you seeing someone?

2639
01:29:52,910 --> 01:29:54,370
你有喜歡的人嗎

2640
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:55,790
Is he here?

2641
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:55,790
他在現場嗎

2642
01:30:12,620 --> 01:30:15,500
Hold on.

2643
01:30:12,620 --> 01:30:15,500
欵 等一下

2644
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:17,410
Is this bottle...

2645
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:17,410
這個瓶子

2646
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:19,370
pointing closer to Tao Minmin?

2647
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:19,370
是不是比較靠近陶敏敏啊

2648
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:20,160
Boss.

2649
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:20,160
老大 · · ·

2650
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:21,250
Ask again. Ask again.

2651
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:21,250
你再問一次 快點 · · ·

2652
01:30:21,370 --> 01:30:22,040
Tao Minmin.

2653
01:30:21,370 --> 01:30:22,040
陶敏敏

2654
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:23,790
Ask again. Ask again.

2655
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:23,790
再問一次 · · ·

2656
01:30:23,910 --> 01:30:27,580
Minmin, Minmin.

2657
01:30:23,910 --> 01:30:27,580
敏敏 · · ·

2658
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:29,330
Have you ever sent out chain letters?

2659
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:29,330
你有寄過幸運信嗎

2660
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:37,450
What the hell is that?

2661
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:37,450
你問這什麼問題啊

2662
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:39,370
Drink it.

2663
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:39,370
自己喝啦

2664
01:30:41,330 --> 01:30:42,540
How did you know that Minmin sent me

2665
01:30:41,330 --> 01:30:42,540
你怎麼知道

2666
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:46,330
the chain letter and reported me?

2667
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:46,330
敏敏寄給我幸運信 還跟老師舉發我

2668
01:30:47,830 --> 01:30:50,250
Who knows that you're sending chain letters?

2669
01:30:47,830 --> 01:30:50,250
誰會知道班上有人在寫幸運信啊

2670
01:30:50,870 --> 01:30:52,790
Must be the person who sent it to you.

2671
01:30:50,870 --> 01:30:52,790
當然是一開始寫信給你的人

2672
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:58,330
Tao Minmin received exactly the same letter

2673
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:58,330
如果陶敏敏收到過跟自己一模一樣的信

2674
01:30:58,580 --> 01:31:00,330
she sent out. That's why she knows

2675
01:30:58,580 --> 01:31:00,330
她纔會知道

2676
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:02,790
one of the classmates who received

2677
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:02,790
一定她自己害的同學裏面

2678
01:31:02,910 --> 01:31:04,660
her letter sent it to the teacher.

2679
01:31:02,910 --> 01:31:04,660
有人把幸運信寄給老師

2680
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:08,410
I guess you're the only one who knows.

2681
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:08,410
我猜她五封信裏面

2682
01:31:09,370 --> 01:31:11,950
Wang Baidan among the 5 receivers.

2683
01:31:09,370 --> 01:31:11,950
只有你認識王白丹

2684
01:31:17,330 --> 01:31:18,200
I never thought

2685
01:31:17,330 --> 01:31:18,200
沒想到

2686
01:31:18,330 --> 01:31:20,120
she would do something like this.

2687
01:31:18,330 --> 01:31:20,120
她會做這種事

2688
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:22,790
I thought she was perfect.

2689
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:22,790
我還以爲她很完美

2690
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:26,540
Now I think your personality is better.

2691
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:26,540
我現在倒覺得她個性沒有你好

2692
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:30,580
And if I look closely...

2693
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:30,580
認真看

2694
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:32,500
she's not that much prettier than you.

2695
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:32,500
好像沒比你漂亮多少

2696
01:31:34,830 --> 01:31:36,830
Maybe just this much prettier.

2697
01:31:34,830 --> 01:31:36,830
大概只有漂亮這麼 多

2698
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:03,910
Which university do you want to go to?

2699
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:03,910
你大學想要考哪裏啊

2700
01:32:06,620 --> 01:32:07,870
Taiwan University, I guess.

2701
01:32:06,620 --> 01:32:07,870
臺大吧

2702
01:32:08,410 --> 01:32:09,580
And you?

2703
01:32:08,410 --> 01:32:09,580
你呢

2704
01:32:10,830 --> 01:32:12,750
Same for me.

2705
01:32:10,830 --> 01:32:12,750
我也想上臺大

2706
01:32:14,910 --> 01:32:17,580
But... I don't think I can get in.

2707
01:32:14,910 --> 01:32:17,580
可是 考不上吧

2708
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:23,160
Hsu Taiyu.

2709
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:23,160
徐太宇

2710
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:26,250
If...

2711
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:26,250
如果

2712
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:28,830
we end up going to different universities,

2713
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:28,830
我們沒有考到同一個地方

2714
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:31,370
can you promise me?

2715
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:31,370
你可不可以答應我

2716
01:32:34,790 --> 01:32:36,120
That...

2717
01:32:34,790 --> 01:32:36,120
以後

2718
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:39,790
you'll continue to study hard and graduate.

2719
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:39,790
還是好好讀書 好好畢業

2720
01:32:41,370 --> 01:32:42,660
That you'll never fight again...

2721
01:32:41,370 --> 01:32:42,660
不要再打架

2722
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:46,290
That you'll never...

2723
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:46,290
不要

2724
01:32:46,410 --> 01:32:48,500
worry people who care about you.

2725
01:32:46,410 --> 01:32:48,500
讓在乎你的人擔心

2726
01:32:57,330 --> 01:32:57,950
Ok.

2727
01:32:57,330 --> 01:32:57,950
嗯

2728
01:32:58,580 --> 01:32:59,910
I promise you.

2729
01:32:58,580 --> 01:32:59,910
我答應你

2730
01:33:04,580 --> 01:33:05,750
What about you?

2731
01:33:04,580 --> 01:33:05,750
那你呢

2732
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:06,950
Yes?

2733
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:06,950
嗯

2734
01:33:11,370 --> 01:33:17,790
If I go to somewhere very far from you,

2735
01:33:11,370 --> 01:33:17,790
如果以後 我跟你念的學校離的很遠很遠

2736
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:20,200
can you promise me?

2737
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:20,200
你可不可以答應我

2738
01:33:28,290 --> 01:33:30,450
That sesame dressing and noodles

2739
01:33:28,290 --> 01:33:30,450
麻醬麪 麻醬跟面

2740
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:31,790
will never be mixed together.

2741
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:31,790
還是要分開

2742
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:34,330
Not funny.

2743
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:34,330
白癡

2744
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:37,160
I'm serious.

2745
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:37,160
我是說真的

2746
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:43,620
Hsu Taiyu.

2747
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:43,620
徐太宇

2748
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:44,910
Shooting star!

2749
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:44,910
有流星

2750
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:46,540
Make a wish.

2751
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:46,540
快許願

2752
01:33:57,540 --> 01:34:00,750
Chain letters can never bring good luck.

2753
01:33:57,540 --> 01:34:00,750
幸運信從來就不能帶來好運

2754
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:03,410
But on that night,

2755
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:03,410
但那個晚上

2756
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:05,700
I felt...

2757
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:05,700
我卻覺得

2758
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:08,160
I found my luck.

2759
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:08,160
我找到了我的幸運

2760
01:34:32,450 --> 01:34:33,370
Welcome to the.

2761
01:34:32,450 --> 01:34:33,370
歡迎收看

2762
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:35,120
"Superstitious Show".

2763
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:35,120
鬼話連篇

2764
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:37,330
Mom! It's starting!

2765
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:37,330
媽 開始了啦

2766
01:34:37,950 --> 01:34:39,620
Let's have a look at this weird picture.

2767
01:34:37,950 --> 01:34:39,620
好我們在來看一張奇怪的照片

2768
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:41,700
A group of high school students went

2769
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:41,700
哦這是上個月一羣高中生

2770
01:34:41,830 --> 01:34:43,330
camping last month and took this photo.

2771
01:34:41,830 --> 01:34:43,330
去山上露營拍到的哦

2772
01:34:43,450 --> 01:34:45,500
Let's hear what the expert has to say.

2773
01:34:43,450 --> 01:34:45,500
我們先來看看專家怎麼說

2774
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:47,750
The student in the photo

2775
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:47,750
照片中的男同學

2776
01:34:47,870 --> 01:34:51,160
became translucent.

2777
01:34:47,870 --> 01:34:51,160
出現了半透明的現象

2778
01:34:52,250 --> 01:34:55,660
If we look at the supernatural aspect of it,

2779
01:34:52,250 --> 01:34:55,660
我們從靈學的角度去研判

2780
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:58,410
it's obvious that

2781
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:58,410
明顯的呢感應到

2782
01:34:58,790 --> 01:35:00,200
this photo

2783
01:34:58,790 --> 01:35:00,200
這張照片

2784
01:35:00,330 --> 01:35:02,870
is full of supernatural energy.

2785
01:35:00,330 --> 01:35:02,870
充滿着靈異的能量

2786
01:35:04,290 --> 01:35:06,250
I suggest the student

2787
01:35:04,290 --> 01:35:06,250
我建議這位同學

2788
01:35:06,370 --> 01:35:09,620
visit temples guarding land and underworld

2789
01:35:06,370 --> 01:35:09,620
要去拜土地公和城隍爺

2790
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:11,250
- to remove ill fortune. - Go home soon.

2791
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:11,250
- 來消災祈福 - 早點回家

2792
01:35:11,370 --> 01:35:12,660
Take care.

2793
01:35:11,370 --> 01:35:12,660
小心安全

2794
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:14,450
Thanks.

2795
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:14,450
謝啦

2796
01:35:30,950 --> 01:35:32,370
Hsu Taiyu.

2797
01:35:30,950 --> 01:35:32,370
徐太宇

2798
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:34,290
I finally...

2799
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:34,290
終於

2800
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:36,330
got you.

2801
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:36,330
堵到你了厚

2802
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:45,750
The bell has rung.

2803
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:45,750
同學打鐘羅

2804
01:35:45,870 --> 01:35:47,160
Hand in your paper.

2805
01:35:45,870 --> 01:35:47,160
交卷

2806
01:35:56,370 --> 01:35:57,620
Sakuraki said that.

2807
01:35:56,370 --> 01:35:57,620
我聽櫻木說啊

2808
01:35:57,750 --> 01:36:00,250
Hsu hasn't come to school for a week.

2809
01:35:57,750 --> 01:36:00,250
徐太宇已經一個禮拜沒有來學校上課

2810
01:36:00,370 --> 01:36:02,370
He's even absent from the mock exam.

2811
01:36:00,370 --> 01:36:02,370
連模擬考他都缺考

2812
01:36:02,830 --> 01:36:05,410
Did you watch the TV show last week?

2813
01:36:02,830 --> 01:36:05,410
你們有沒有看上個禮拜的玫瑰之夜啊

2814
01:36:05,540 --> 01:36:07,790
Maybe something really happened to him?

2815
01:36:05,540 --> 01:36:07,790
他不會真的出什麼事了吧

2816
01:36:07,910 --> 01:36:09,450
I don't think so.

2817
01:36:07,910 --> 01:36:09,450
不會吧

2818
01:36:47,910 --> 01:36:49,160
Hsu Taiyu.

2819
01:36:47,910 --> 01:36:49,160
徐太宇

2820
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:56,410
Why didn't you take the mock exam?

2821
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:56,410
你爲什麼沒來學校模擬考

2822
01:36:56,540 --> 01:36:57,790
None of your business.

2823
01:36:56,540 --> 01:36:57,790
不關你的事

2824
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:02,370
Why did you... fight again?

2825
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:02,370
爲什麼 又打架

2826
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:03,660
For no reason.

2827
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:03,660
沒有爲什麼

2828
01:37:05,290 --> 01:37:06,330
They wanted to fight.

2829
01:37:05,290 --> 01:37:06,330
他們想打

2830
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:07,870
So I fought with them.

2831
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:07,870
我就陪他們打

2832
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:15,790
Hsu Taiyu.

2833
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:15,790
徐太宇

2834
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:19,620
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

2835
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:19,620
我再也不想理你了

2836
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:30,750
When a girl says

2837
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:30,750
當一個女生說

2838
01:37:30,870 --> 01:37:33,330
"nothing's wrong", something must be wrong.

2839
01:37:30,870 --> 01:37:33,330
我沒事就是有事

2840
01:37:33,450 --> 01:37:35,950
"I'm ok" means "I'm not ok."

2841
01:37:33,450 --> 01:37:35,950
沒關係就是有關係

2842
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:38,040
We didn't know until

2843
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:38,040
很久很久以後

2844
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:39,540
long after that:

2845
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:39,540
我們才知道

2846
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:42,080
When a girl says.

2847
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:42,080
當一個女生說

2848
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:43,750
"I don't want to talk to you anymore."

2849
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:43,750
她再也不理你

2850
01:37:44,250 --> 01:37:45,910
She doesn't really hate you.

2851
01:37:44,250 --> 01:37:45,910
不是真的討厭你

2852
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:48,580
Instead she cares about you...

2853
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:48,580
而是她很在乎你

2854
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:50,750
very

2855
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:50,750
非常

2856
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:52,790
very much.

2857
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:52,790
非常 在乎你

2858
01:38:29,870 --> 01:38:31,370
Happy birthday!

2859
01:38:29,870 --> 01:38:31,370
生日快樂

2860
01:38:35,370 --> 01:38:36,580
Thank you...

2861
01:38:35,370 --> 01:38:36,580
謝謝

2862
01:38:37,410 --> 01:38:38,580
This is...

2863
01:38:37,410 --> 01:38:38,580
這是

2864
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:40,660
Boss brought it back himself.

2865
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:40,660
是老大親手去搬的

2866
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:42,700
We don't know what he's been busy with,

2867
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:42,700
最近他不知道在忙什麼

2868
01:38:43,370 --> 01:38:45,580
but he still remembers your birthday.

2869
01:38:43,370 --> 01:38:45,580
但是他還是記得明天是你的生日哦

2870
01:38:45,910 --> 01:38:47,370
And this!

2871
01:38:45,910 --> 01:38:47,370
還有這個

2872
01:38:47,790 --> 01:38:49,200
Boss said that you shouldn't listen to it

2873
01:38:47,790 --> 01:38:49,200
老大特別交代

2874
01:38:49,330 --> 01:38:51,200
before the university entrance exam.

2875
01:38:49,330 --> 01:38:51,200
聯考過後才能夠聽

2876
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:53,660
There must be something special in it.

2877
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:53,660
一定有什麼Special的

2878
01:38:58,160 --> 01:38:59,750
When you see boss in school tomorrow,

2879
01:38:58,160 --> 01:38:59,750
明天去學校

2880
01:39:00,830 --> 01:39:02,660
don't forget to thank him.

2881
01:39:00,830 --> 01:39:02,660
記得好好跟老大說聲謝謝

2882
01:39:04,370 --> 01:39:05,500
Bye bye.

2883
01:39:04,370 --> 01:39:05,500
再見

2884
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:19,540
Lin Truly.

2885
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:19,540
林真心

2886
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:23,620
Today's your birthday, let's go to...

2887
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:23,620
今天是你生日我看我們放學去吃

2888
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:24,700
Chicken House...

2889
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:24,700
香雞城

2890
01:39:24,830 --> 01:39:27,080
Great! Hand-shredded chicken set for me.

2891
01:39:24,830 --> 01:39:27,080
好 · · ·我要吃那個手扒雞套餐

2892
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:28,620
I'm gonna have two.

2893
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:28,620
我要吃兩隻

2894
01:39:30,450 --> 01:39:31,410
Look! It's Hsu Taiyu.

2895
01:39:30,450 --> 01:39:31,410
是 317 的徐太宇耶

2896
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:32,540
Who is he looking for?

2897
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:32,540
他要找誰啊

2898
01:39:32,660 --> 01:39:33,330
Hsu Taiyu.

2899
01:39:32,660 --> 01:39:33,330
徐太宇

2900
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:37,290
Lin Truly...

2901
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:37,290

2902
01:39:37,410 --> 01:39:38,580
go go go.

2903
01:39:37,410 --> 01:39:38,580
趕快去

2904
01:39:38,830 --> 01:39:41,580
He came to see you, Lin Truly.

2905
01:39:38,830 --> 01:39:41,580
特地來班上找你哦 林真心

2906
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:43,620
Happy birthday...

2907
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:43,620
過生日哦

2908
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:46,700
So romantic!

2909
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:46,700
好浪漫喔

2910
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:15,080
Last night...

2911
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:15,080
昨天

2912
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:16,160
Thank you.

2913
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:16,160
謝謝

2914
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:18,160
Oh. You're welcome.

2915
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:18,160
哦 沒什麼

2916
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:19,790
Did you like it?

2917
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:19,790
那東西你喜歡嗎

2918
01:40:20,330 --> 01:40:22,160
Of course!

2919
01:40:20,330 --> 01:40:22,160
嗯  當然啊

2920
01:40:23,370 --> 01:40:24,500
Happy birthday.

2921
01:40:23,370 --> 01:40:24,500
生日快樂

2922
01:40:26,950 --> 01:40:29,950
What did you want to say?

2923
01:40:26,950 --> 01:40:29,950
啊 找我什麼事啊

2924
01:40:30,620 --> 01:40:32,250
Small and Meimei are waiting for me.

2925
01:40:30,620 --> 01:40:32,250
小隻她們還在等我

2926
01:40:32,370 --> 01:40:34,500
We're discussing where to go for dinner.

2927
01:40:32,370 --> 01:40:34,500
我們在討論晚上要去哪裏慶生

2928
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:37,790
Do you want to join us?

2929
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:37,790
你要一起來嗎

2930
01:40:39,410 --> 01:40:40,660
By the way.

2931
01:40:39,410 --> 01:40:40,660
啊  對了

2932
01:40:41,290 --> 01:40:43,080
Please write this for me.

2933
01:40:41,290 --> 01:40:43,080
這個畢業紀念冊你拿去寫

2934
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:44,450
Make sure you...

2935
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:44,450
要照

2936
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:46,410
fill in your personal info

2937
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:46,410
第一頁那樣

2938
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:48,160
like the sample on page 1.

2939
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:48,160
填完個人資料哦

2940
01:40:51,370 --> 01:40:51,870
What's wrong?

2941
01:40:51,370 --> 01:40:51,870
嗯

2942
01:40:52,370 --> 01:40:53,250
Taiyu...

2943
01:40:52,370 --> 01:40:53,250
太宇

2944
01:41:01,370 --> 01:41:02,370
Were you looking for me?

2945
01:41:01,370 --> 01:41:02,370
你剛到班上來找我

2946
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:03,700
For what?

2947
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:03,700
做什麼

2948
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:16,790
Wait for me here.

2949
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:16,790
你等我一下

2950
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:28,830
So you came for Minmin?

2951
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:28,830
你是來找敏敏的啊

2952
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:31,950
You should've told me...

2953
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:31,950
早說嘛

2954
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:37,450
you came for Minmin to...

2955
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:37,450
你找敏敏 · · ·

2956
01:41:37,580 --> 01:41:38,790
She told me she likes me.

2957
01:41:37,580 --> 01:41:38,790
她跟我告白

2958
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:54,160
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

2959
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:54,160
怎麼現在才告訴我

2960
01:41:55,910 --> 01:41:57,790
Hmmm... congratulations.

2961
01:41:55,910 --> 01:41:57,790
嗯 恭喜啊

2962
01:41:58,450 --> 01:41:59,580
What a surprise!

2963
01:41:58,450 --> 01:41:59,580
嚇我一跳

2964
01:41:59,700 --> 01:42:01,660
I even helped you chase her for so long.

2965
01:41:59,700 --> 01:42:01,660
虧我幫你追她追那麼久

2966
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:04,250
Congratulations.

2967
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:04,250
恭喜你

2968
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:06,160
Finally.

2969
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:06,160
修成正果

2970
01:42:06,450 --> 01:42:07,660
Thank you.

2971
01:42:06,450 --> 01:42:07,660
謝謝你

2972
01:42:10,370 --> 01:42:11,580
It'll definitely work out

2973
01:42:10,370 --> 01:42:11,580
你跟歐陽

2974
01:42:11,700 --> 01:42:12,910
between Ouyang and you.

2975
01:42:11,700 --> 01:42:12,910
一定也沒問題的

2976
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:15,660
Good luck.

2977
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:15,660
祝你好運

2978
01:42:21,410 --> 01:42:22,370
Thanks.

2979
01:42:21,410 --> 01:42:22,370
嗯

2980
01:42:23,790 --> 01:42:26,160
I'm... really happy for you.

2981
01:42:23,790 --> 01:42:26,160
我 真的很替你開心

2982
01:42:40,330 --> 01:42:41,580
It's pouring rain...

2983
01:42:40,330 --> 01:42:41,580
雨很大了耶

2984
01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:46,750
Goodbye.

2985
01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:46,750
再見

2986
01:42:48,620 --> 01:42:49,910
Come with us...

2987
01:42:48,620 --> 01:42:49,910
一起走啊

2988
01:42:54,370 --> 01:42:56,160
It's ok. Thanks.

2989
01:42:54,370 --> 01:42:56,160
不用啦 謝謝

2990
01:43:53,700 --> 01:43:55,620
Look! It says that

2991
01:43:53,700 --> 01:43:55,620
喂 大成報說啊

2992
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:57,750
Andy Lau has a girlfriend!

2993
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:57,750
劉德華現在有女朋友耶

2994
01:43:57,870 --> 01:44:00,830
What? It must be rumor.

2995
01:43:57,870 --> 01:44:00,830
蛤 這一定是假消息啦

2996
01:44:00,950 --> 01:44:03,750
Andy Lau will never get married.

2997
01:44:00,950 --> 01:44:03,750
劉德華是永遠不會結婚的

2998
01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:07,290
We all dreamed of marrying our idols,

2999
01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:07,290
就像我們都幻想能嫁給偶像

3000
01:44:07,410 --> 01:44:08,540
That must be a rumor.

3001
01:44:07,410 --> 01:44:08,540
假的啦假的啦

3002
01:44:08,660 --> 01:44:10,250
But in reality...

3003
01:44:08,660 --> 01:44:10,250
但現實是

3004
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:13,750
Of course Andy Lau belongs to someone else.

3005
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:13,750
劉德華終究是別人的

3006
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:16,660
Same for our first love.

3007
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:16,660
我們的初戀

3008
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:19,790
Of course we can't beat girls like Minmin.

3009
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:19,790
註定會輸給像陶敏敏那樣的女孩

3010
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Morning.

3011
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,000
早

3012
01:44:34,620 --> 01:44:35,950
Don't cry.

3013
01:44:34,620 --> 01:44:35,950
不要難過啦

3014
01:44:36,290 --> 01:44:37,040
Morning.

3015
01:44:36,290 --> 01:44:37,040
早安

3016
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:39,330
Going abroad as soon as he got you.

3017
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:39,330
追到手就出國唸書

3018
01:44:39,450 --> 01:44:41,250
He was just fooling you.

3019
01:44:39,450 --> 01:44:41,250
根本在耍你啊

3020
01:44:41,870 --> 01:44:42,750
In the end...

3021
01:44:41,870 --> 01:44:42,750
果然哦

3022
01:44:42,870 --> 01:44:45,330
we shouldn't have trusted a freak who

3023
01:44:42,870 --> 01:44:45,330
要求麻醬跟面分開的怪咖

3024
01:44:45,450 --> 01:44:47,160
separates sesame dressing from noodles.

3025
01:44:45,450 --> 01:44:47,160
還是不能相信啦

3026
01:45:59,250 --> 01:46:00,580
I heard that Director Chuan

3027
01:45:59,250 --> 01:46:00,580
我聽說啊

3028
01:46:00,910 --> 01:46:03,250
caught him fighting with others

3029
01:46:00,910 --> 01:46:03,250
全主任抓到他在校外械鬥

3030
01:46:03,370 --> 01:46:04,410
and wanted to kick him out of the school.

3031
01:46:03,370 --> 01:46:04,410
要他退學

3032
01:46:04,540 --> 01:46:06,540
That's why his dad sent him abroad.

3033
01:46:04,540 --> 01:46:06,540
所以他爸才把他送出國

3034
01:46:06,950 --> 01:46:07,830
What? Really?

3035
01:46:06,950 --> 01:46:07,830
蛤 真的假的

3036
01:46:07,950 --> 01:46:08,910
Shhh...

3037
01:46:07,950 --> 01:46:08,910
欵 · · · 噓

3038
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:10,790
Quiet. Here she comes.

3039
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:10,790
不要說了 她來了

3040
01:46:12,410 --> 01:46:13,750
What are you talking about?

3041
01:46:12,410 --> 01:46:13,750
在聊什麼啊

3042
01:46:13,870 --> 01:46:15,370
We are here to study.

3043
01:46:13,870 --> 01:46:15,370
我們是來看書的

3044
01:46:15,790 --> 01:46:17,370
- Yes - Right.

3045
01:46:15,790 --> 01:46:17,370
- 嗯 -  對

3046
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:22,540
Back then, there was no facebook.

3047
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:22,540
在那個沒有臉書的年代

3048
01:46:23,580 --> 01:46:25,200
12,000km means

3049
01:46:23,580 --> 01:46:25,200
一萬二仟公里

3050
01:46:25,620 --> 01:46:27,410
parting for good.

3051
01:46:25,620 --> 01:46:27,410
就是永別的距離

3052
01:46:29,580 --> 01:46:31,250
But sometimes

3053
01:46:29,580 --> 01:46:31,250
只是有時候

3054
01:46:31,370 --> 01:46:32,870
there were some moments,

3055
01:46:31,370 --> 01:46:32,870
在某個瞬間

3056
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:34,620
I felt he would appear

3057
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:34,620
會覺得好像下一秒

3058
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:36,200
the next second.

3059
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:36,200
他就會出現

3060
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:38,040
Are you ok?

3061
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:38,040
沒事吧

3062
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:39,290
Be careful.

3063
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:39,290
小心點

3064
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:42,870
This is the ultimate note.

3065
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:42,870
大補帖給你

3066
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:44,620
等你考完

3067
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:44,630
Let's go roller skating

3068
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:46,250
after you finish the exam.

3069
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:46,250
我們去溜冰

3070
01:46:46,370 --> 01:46:47,450
Or...

3071
01:46:46,370 --> 01:46:47,450
還是

3072
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:49,040
do you want to go to the movies?

3073
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:49,040
你想看電影

3074
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:51,660
Ah! Stephen Chow's ”Monkey King” is on again.

3075
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:51,660
啊  周星馳那部西遊記上二輪了

3076
01:46:51,790 --> 01:46:53,250
I want to watch it again.

3077
01:46:51,790 --> 01:46:53,250
我想再看一次

3078
01:46:53,620 --> 01:46:54,500
Last time...

3079
01:46:53,620 --> 01:46:54,500
上次

3080
01:46:54,620 --> 01:46:55,580
I didn't quite get it.

3081
01:46:54,620 --> 01:46:55,580
好像看不太懂

3082
01:47:05,370 --> 01:47:06,790
Hsu Taiyu left.

3083
01:47:05,370 --> 01:47:06,790
徐太宇離開了

3084
01:47:07,790 --> 01:47:09,250
My life

3085
01:47:07,790 --> 01:47:09,250
我的生活

3086
01:47:09,370 --> 01:47:11,790
seemed to be back to the same old.

3087
01:47:09,370 --> 01:47:11,790
好像回到遇見他之前的原點

3088
01:47:13,580 --> 01:47:14,830
But I know

3089
01:47:13,580 --> 01:47:14,830
但我知道

3090
01:47:15,620 --> 01:47:16,790
because of him.

3091
01:47:15,620 --> 01:47:16,790
因爲他

3092
01:47:17,790 --> 01:47:19,250
I am...

3093
01:47:17,790 --> 01:47:19,250
我纔是

3094
01:47:19,870 --> 01:47:21,200
who I am now.

3095
01:47:19,870 --> 01:47:21,200
現在的我

3096
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:24,540
(TO: LIN TRULY)

3097
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:24,540
(林真心 收)

3098
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:25,450
好

3099
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:25,500
OK.

3100
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:30,370
(YOU'RE PRETTY. CAN I BE YOUR FRIEND?)

3101
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:31,660
Congratulations.

3102
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:31,660
恭喜你

3103
01:47:31,790 --> 01:47:33,370
Finally done with the entrance exam.

3104
01:47:31,790 --> 01:47:33,370
考完聯考了

3105
01:47:35,290 --> 01:47:36,370
Thanks.

3106
01:47:35,290 --> 01:47:36,370
謝啦

3107
01:47:36,870 --> 01:47:37,790
I think...

3108
01:47:36,870 --> 01:47:37,790
這次

3109
01:47:37,910 --> 01:47:39,450
I did pretty well in math.

3110
01:47:37,910 --> 01:47:39,450
數學成績還不錯

3111
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:41,750
Thanks for the ultimate note.

3112
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:41,750
多虧你整理給我的大補帖

3113
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:46,200
Did you...

3114
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:46,200
那

3115
01:47:46,750 --> 01:47:47,950
listen to the tape?

3116
01:47:46,750 --> 01:47:47,950
你聽了嗎

3117
01:47:48,700 --> 01:47:50,580
The one Taiyu gave you.

3118
01:47:48,700 --> 01:47:50,580
太宇送你的那捲卡帶

3119
01:47:58,790 --> 01:47:59,910
I promised him

3120
01:47:58,790 --> 01:47:59,910
提醒你這個

3121
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:02,160
to remind you of this.

3122
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:02,160
也是我答應他的事

3123
01:48:02,950 --> 01:48:04,450
It's a shame that

3124
01:48:02,950 --> 01:48:04,450
只是很可惜

3125
01:48:05,410 --> 01:48:06,410
the ending

3126
01:48:05,410 --> 01:48:06,410
結局

3127
01:48:06,910 --> 01:48:08,200
isn't like what he thought.

3128
01:48:06,910 --> 01:48:08,200
不是他想的那樣

3129
01:48:10,790 --> 01:48:12,330
Hsu Taiyu! Shooting star!

3130
01:48:10,790 --> 01:48:12,330
徐太宇 有流星

3131
01:48:12,450 --> 01:48:13,500
Make a wish!

3132
01:48:12,450 --> 01:48:13,500
快許願

3133
01:48:22,330 --> 01:48:24,450
You know that I heard it, right?

3134
01:48:22,330 --> 01:48:24,450
你不會以爲我會裝沒聽到吧

3135
01:48:25,580 --> 01:48:27,250
The person you like...

3136
01:48:25,580 --> 01:48:27,250
你喜歡的人

3137
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:29,790
is here.

3138
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:29,790
在現場

3139
01:48:37,950 --> 01:48:39,160
In the beginning,

3140
01:48:37,950 --> 01:48:39,160
一開始

3141
01:48:39,540 --> 01:48:42,200
I thought whoever believed in chain letters

3142
01:48:39,540 --> 01:48:42,200
看到有人相信幸運信這種事

3143
01:48:42,790 --> 01:48:44,660
was either an idiot

3144
01:48:42,790 --> 01:48:44,660
我覺得他應該不是白癡

3145
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:46,290
or an idiot.

3146
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:46,290
就是弱智

3147
01:48:47,540 --> 01:48:48,450
But later I realized that

3148
01:48:47,540 --> 01:48:48,450
可是後來發現

3149
01:48:48,580 --> 01:48:50,580
she's simply a very kind person.

3150
01:48:48,580 --> 01:48:50,580
她只是一個很善良的人

3151
01:48:50,700 --> 01:48:52,040
To whoever received this:

3152
01:48:50,700 --> 01:48:52,040
收到這封信的人

3153
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:53,040
I am really really sorry.

3154
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:53,040
真的對不起

3155
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:55,120
I was forced to send it...

3156
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:55,120
其實 我也是逼不得已的

3157
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:56,620
You might be hit by a car,

3158
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:56,620
你可能會被車撞

3159
01:48:56,750 --> 01:48:57,660
get cancer...

3160
01:48:56,750 --> 01:48:57,660
得絕症

3161
01:48:57,790 --> 01:48:59,580
or... lose your family.

3162
01:48:57,790 --> 01:48:59,580
或 · · ·或家破人亡

3163
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:00,330
But...

3164
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:00,330
但

3165
01:49:00,450 --> 01:49:01,700
I'm sure you'll turn ill luck into good,

3166
01:49:00,450 --> 01:49:01,700
你一定會逢凶化吉

3167
01:49:01,830 --> 01:49:02,620
have a successful life,

3168
01:49:01,830 --> 01:49:02,620
一帆風順

3169
01:49:02,750 --> 01:49:03,750
become wealthy.

3170
01:49:02,750 --> 01:49:03,750
年年有餘

3171
01:49:06,330 --> 01:49:07,500
That's why I wanted to know her.

3172
01:49:06,330 --> 01:49:07,500
所以說要跟他做朋友

3173
01:49:07,620 --> 01:49:09,370
Let's be friends.

3174
01:49:07,620 --> 01:49:09,370
我們  交個朋友吧

3175
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:10,750
I was serious.

3176
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:10,750
我是認真的

3177
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:12,500
What?

3178
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:12,500
蛤

3179
01:49:12,870 --> 01:49:14,540
I thought chasing girls...

3180
01:49:12,870 --> 01:49:14,540
本來我覺得追女生

3181
01:49:14,660 --> 01:49:16,040
was that simple.

3182
01:49:14,660 --> 01:49:16,040
不就這麼一回事

3183
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:17,450
Tao Minmin.

3184
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:17,450
陶敏敏同學

3185
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:18,250
Wanna be my gal?

3186
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:18,250
要不要做我女朋友

3187
01:49:18,370 --> 01:49:21,200
Say yes! Say yes!

3188
01:49:18,370 --> 01:49:21,200
大嫂 · · ·

3189
01:49:27,450 --> 01:49:28,830
Later I realized...

3190
01:49:27,450 --> 01:49:28,830
後來才明白

3191
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:31,500
if you really like someone...

3192
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:31,500
如果你真的喜歡一個人

3193
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:34,410
you might not even notice it.

3194
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:34,410
是不知不覺

3195
01:49:36,950 --> 01:49:39,410
I was actually super nervous that day.

3196
01:49:36,950 --> 01:49:39,410
那一天我其實超緊張

3197
01:49:41,870 --> 01:49:43,370
I have to thank that car.

3198
01:49:41,870 --> 01:49:43,370
感謝那輛車

3199
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:45,620
The moment I held her in my arm...

3200
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:45,620
搭住她肩的那一刻

3201
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:47,250
I realized that I never knew...

3202
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:47,250
我第一次發現

3203
01:49:47,580 --> 01:49:50,160
my heart... can beat so fast.

3204
01:49:47,580 --> 01:49:50,160
心 可以跳這麼快

3205
01:49:53,410 --> 01:49:56,200
What... were you... talking about?

3206
01:49:53,410 --> 01:49:56,200
剛 敏敏找你幹嘛

3207
01:49:56,370 --> 01:49:59,540
I didn't want her to misunderstand.

3208
01:49:56,370 --> 01:49:59,540
怕她誤會所以不想說太多

3209
01:50:00,250 --> 01:50:01,790
But somehow...

3210
01:50:00,250 --> 01:50:01,790
但是不知道爲什麼

3211
01:50:02,370 --> 01:50:04,040
at the end of that day

3212
01:50:02,370 --> 01:50:04,040
那一天到最後

3213
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:05,700
she didn't seem happy.

3214
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:05,700
她好像不太開心

3215
01:50:08,540 --> 01:50:10,290
When you like someone

3216
01:50:08,540 --> 01:50:10,290
原來喜歡一個人

3217
01:50:11,620 --> 01:50:15,450
and see her walk to someone she likes,

3218
01:50:11,620 --> 01:50:15,450
當你看到她走向她喜歡的人

3219
01:50:16,540 --> 01:50:18,200
you'd suddenly realize that

3220
01:50:16,540 --> 01:50:18,200
才突然發現

3221
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:20,750
you treat her badly just because

3222
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:20,750
你對她很壞

3223
01:50:23,790 --> 01:50:26,660
you want to get a bit closer to her.

3224
01:50:23,790 --> 01:50:26,660
只是爲了想跟她更靠近一點

3225
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:37,790
For me?

3226
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:37,790
送我哦

3227
01:50:39,950 --> 01:50:41,620
You'll keep every word she said

3228
01:50:39,950 --> 01:50:41,620
她說的每一句話

3229
01:50:41,750 --> 01:50:43,450
in mind.

3230
01:50:41,750 --> 01:50:43,450
你都會放在心上

3231
01:50:44,370 --> 01:50:45,410
Nothing's wrong.

3232
01:50:44,370 --> 01:50:45,410
我沒事

3233
01:50:45,830 --> 01:50:47,160
Bye.

3234
01:50:45,830 --> 01:50:47,160
先這樣

3235
01:50:48,910 --> 01:50:51,200
When we say nothing's wrong...

3236
01:50:48,910 --> 01:50:51,200
我們說沒事

3237
01:50:51,580 --> 01:50:52,540
it means something's wrong.

3238
01:50:51,580 --> 01:50:52,540
就是有事

3239
01:50:52,660 --> 01:50:54,040
When we say it's ok,

3240
01:50:52,660 --> 01:50:54,040
沒關係

3241
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:55,410
it means it's not ok.

3242
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:55,410
就是有關係

3243
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:02,160
Are you ok?

3244
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:02,160
沒事吧

3245
01:51:02,580 --> 01:51:04,250
I didn't know that when I'm in love,

3246
01:51:02,580 --> 01:51:04,250
原來喜歡一個人

3247
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:06,750
I actually have no courage to tell her.

3248
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:06,750
會沒有勇氣告訴她

3249
01:51:08,870 --> 01:51:09,540
On that night,

3250
01:51:08,870 --> 01:51:09,540
那個晚上

3251
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:11,290
I made a wish upon a shooting star.

3252
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:11,290
我向流星許願

3253
01:51:12,290 --> 01:51:13,910
I wish I was also

3254
01:51:12,290 --> 01:51:13,910
希望她的願望裏

3255
01:51:14,330 --> 01:51:15,370
in her wish.

3256
01:51:14,330 --> 01:51:15,370
也有我

3257
01:51:16,790 --> 01:51:20,370
Even if I know it's someone else

3258
01:51:16,790 --> 01:51:20,370
即使我知道能讓她快樂的

3259
01:51:20,700 --> 01:51:21,950
who could make her happy...

3260
01:51:20,700 --> 01:51:21,950
是另一個人

3261
01:51:24,410 --> 01:51:27,660
Sometimes... she still pretends to be ok

3262
01:51:24,410 --> 01:51:27,660
她 有時候明明很難過

3263
01:51:28,580 --> 01:51:30,160
even when she feels very sad.

3264
01:51:28,580 --> 01:51:30,160
還會逞強說自己沒事

3265
01:51:30,950 --> 01:51:32,750
Spending 5 minutes deciding what to have,

3266
01:51:30,950 --> 01:51:32,750
早餐會猶豫五分鐘

3267
01:51:33,790 --> 01:51:35,830
before choosing the same old raddish cake.

3268
01:51:33,790 --> 01:51:35,830
但最後還是選擇蘿蔔糕

3269
01:51:37,830 --> 01:51:39,790
She doesn't watch where she's going.

3270
01:51:37,830 --> 01:51:39,790
她常常走路不看路

3271
01:51:40,830 --> 01:51:43,450
Please watch her at all times.

3272
01:51:40,830 --> 01:51:43,450
要記得 時刻看着她

3273
01:51:43,580 --> 01:51:44,450
Are you ok?

3274
01:51:43,580 --> 01:51:44,450
沒事吧

3275
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:46,290
She wants to go to Taiwan University,

3276
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:46,290
想考臺大

3277
01:51:46,410 --> 01:51:47,950
but she's really bad at math.

3278
01:51:46,410 --> 01:51:47,950
但是數學很差

3279
01:51:49,830 --> 01:51:50,790
She likes roller skating,

3280
01:51:49,830 --> 01:51:50,790
喜歡溜冰

3281
01:51:50,910 --> 01:51:52,330
loves Stephen Chow's films...

3282
01:51:50,910 --> 01:51:52,330
愛看周星馳

3283
01:51:52,450 --> 01:51:53,500
Let's go roller skating

3284
01:51:52,450 --> 01:51:53,500
等你考完試

3285
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:54,660
after you finish the exam.

3286
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:54,660
我們去溜冰

3287
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:56,200
She...

3288
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:56,200
她

3289
01:52:03,700 --> 01:52:05,160
likes you very much.

3290
01:52:03,700 --> 01:52:05,160
她很喜歡你

3291
01:52:07,750 --> 01:52:08,950
I didn't know that

3292
01:52:07,750 --> 01:52:08,950
我後來才知道

3293
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:10,790
he disappeared for so long

3294
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:10,790
他失蹤那麼久

3295
01:52:11,410 --> 01:52:12,790
was because he had a surgery.

3296
01:52:11,410 --> 01:52:12,790
是在醫院開刀

3297
01:52:32,290 --> 01:52:33,370
Do you see that?

3298
01:52:32,290 --> 01:52:33,370
看到沒有

3299
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:35,580
You have a blood clot here.

3300
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:35,580
腦膜下腔這邊有一點血塊

3301
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:38,450
This is why you passed out when running.

3302
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:38,450
這就是造成你跑步暈倒的原因

3303
01:52:38,580 --> 01:52:41,040
It might be caused by the car accident.

3304
01:52:38,580 --> 01:52:41,040
可能是之前車禍的後遺症

3305
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:42,290
That sounds really bad!

3306
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:42,290
這麼嚴重哦

3307
01:52:43,250 --> 01:52:45,870
Should've charged the driver more.

3308
01:52:43,250 --> 01:52:45,870
早知道跟撞我的人多收一點醫藥費

3309
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:47,950
You really should.

3310
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:47,950
你的確應該

3311
01:52:48,620 --> 01:52:49,750
You'll need a surgery

3312
01:52:48,620 --> 01:52:49,750
這要動刀

3313
01:52:49,870 --> 01:52:51,330
and stay in the hospital.

3314
01:52:49,870 --> 01:52:51,330
還要住院

3315
01:52:51,450 --> 01:52:53,660
Your family has to come to look after you.

3316
01:52:51,450 --> 01:52:53,660
通知一下你的家人來照顧你

3317
01:52:55,870 --> 01:52:57,540
He wanted me to keep the secret.

3318
01:52:55,870 --> 01:52:57,540
他希望我保密

3319
01:52:57,910 --> 01:52:58,790
I guess...

3320
01:52:57,910 --> 01:52:58,790
我想

3321
01:52:59,370 --> 01:53:02,700
he didn't want you to blame yourself.

3322
01:52:59,370 --> 01:53:02,700
他一定是擔心你 因爲那場車禍自責

3323
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:06,830
His family told the school long time ago

3324
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:06,830
他們家很早就跟學校聯絡

3325
01:53:06,950 --> 01:53:08,580
that they wanted to take him to the U.S..

3326
01:53:06,950 --> 01:53:08,580
要他移民美國

3327
01:53:10,540 --> 01:53:11,620
Hsu Taiyu.

3328
01:53:10,540 --> 01:53:11,620
徐太宇同學

3329
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:14,370
I hope you can start over again

3330
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:14,370
我希望你到美國之後

3331
01:53:14,830 --> 01:53:16,620
after arriving in the U.S..

3332
01:53:14,830 --> 01:53:16,620
能夠重新開始

3333
01:53:17,620 --> 01:53:18,660
Director.

3334
01:53:17,620 --> 01:53:18,660
主任

3335
01:53:21,410 --> 01:53:22,450
Thank you.

3336
01:53:21,410 --> 01:53:22,450
謝謝

3337
01:53:23,660 --> 01:53:25,040
Sakuraki said that.

3338
01:53:23,660 --> 01:53:25,040
我聽櫻木說啊

3339
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:27,540
Hsu hasn't come to school for a week.

3340
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:27,540
徐太宇已經一個禮拜沒有來學校上課了

3341
01:53:27,660 --> 01:53:29,700
He's even absent from the mock exam.

3342
01:53:27,660 --> 01:53:29,700
連模擬考他都缺考

3343
01:53:31,290 --> 01:53:33,660
Aren't you moving to the U.S. soon?

3344
01:53:31,290 --> 01:53:33,660
之後開完刀你不是要跟家人移民了嗎

3345
01:53:33,790 --> 01:53:34,790
Why are you still studying this?

3346
01:53:33,790 --> 01:53:34,790
還讀這些幹嘛什麼

3347
01:53:35,830 --> 01:53:37,160
Because...

3348
01:53:35,830 --> 01:53:37,160
因爲

3349
01:53:38,250 --> 01:53:39,370
I made a promise.

3350
01:53:38,250 --> 01:53:39,370
我答應了一個人

3351
01:53:39,750 --> 01:53:40,950
Can you...

3352
01:53:39,750 --> 01:53:40,950
你可不可以

3353
01:53:42,330 --> 01:53:43,540
be that Hsu Taiyu again?

3354
01:53:42,330 --> 01:53:43,540
做回徐太宇

3355
01:53:44,620 --> 01:53:46,790
Why did you... fight again?

3356
01:53:44,620 --> 01:53:46,790
爲什麼 又打架

3357
01:53:46,910 --> 01:53:48,160
For no reason.

3358
01:53:46,910 --> 01:53:48,160
沒有爲什麼

3359
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:50,450
They wanted to fight.

3360
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:50,450
他們想打

3361
01:53:50,580 --> 01:53:51,790
So I fought with them.

3362
01:53:50,580 --> 01:53:51,790
我就陪他們打

3363
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:01,330
Sorry for coming here so late

3364
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:01,330
不好意思這麼晚來買東西

3365
01:54:01,450 --> 01:54:03,250
and asking that standee for free.

3366
01:54:01,450 --> 01:54:03,250
還要求加送人型立牌

3367
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:04,370
Sorry.

3368
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:04,370
歹勢啊

3369
01:54:07,370 --> 01:54:08,620
Hsu Taiyu.

3370
01:54:07,370 --> 01:54:08,620
徐太宇

3371
01:54:09,450 --> 01:54:10,370
I finally

3372
01:54:09,450 --> 01:54:10,370
終於

3373
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:12,370
got you.

3374
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:12,370
堵到你了厚

3375
01:54:12,790 --> 01:54:14,160
It's Andy Lau!

3376
01:54:12,790 --> 01:54:14,160
劉德華耶

3377
01:54:15,540 --> 01:54:16,910
Don't you motherfucker dodge!

3378
01:54:15,540 --> 01:54:16,910
他媽的你還敢閃

3379
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:19,160
You want me to invite your gal for tea?

3380
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:19,160
不要逼我請你馬子喝茶

3381
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:20,620
She always goes to

3382
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:20,620
她放學

3383
01:54:20,910 --> 01:54:22,580
that teashop to study.

3384
01:54:20,910 --> 01:54:22,580
會去小歇看書嘛

3385
01:54:22,910 --> 01:54:24,250
Class...

3386
01:54:22,910 --> 01:54:24,250
三年

3387
01:54:24,370 --> 01:54:25,450
304...

3388
01:54:24,370 --> 01:54:25,450
四班

3389
01:54:25,580 --> 01:54:27,620
Lin... Tru... ly...

3390
01:54:25,580 --> 01:54:27,620
林 真 心

3391
01:54:28,700 --> 01:54:29,790
Don't you ever touch her!

3392
01:54:28,700 --> 01:54:29,790
你敢動她試看看

3393
01:54:29,910 --> 01:54:33,080
It depends on whether you're a good boy...

3394
01:54:29,910 --> 01:54:33,080
那要看你今天聽不聽話

3395
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:37,410
whether you let me beat you... up...

3396
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:37,410
讓我打得爽不爽啊

3397
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:38,540
Lin Truly.

3398
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:38,540
林真心

3399
01:55:40,790 --> 01:55:43,500
Now you're with the person you like, right?

3400
01:55:40,790 --> 01:55:43,500
你現在應該跟喜歡的人在一起了吧

3401
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:53,580
I won Tao Minmin's heart.

3402
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:53,580
我追到陶敏敏

3403
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:56,450
You won Ouyang's.

3404
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:56,450
你追到歐陽

3405
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:00,370
We fulfilled the promise

3406
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:00,370
完成

3407
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:03,790
we made in the beginning.

3408
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:03,790
我們一開始說好的約定

3409
01:56:05,790 --> 01:56:06,750
I guess...

3410
01:56:05,790 --> 01:56:06,750
我想

3411
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:10,410
this is the only

3412
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:10,410
這是我能爲你做的唯一

3413
01:56:11,330 --> 01:56:13,200
and the last thing I could do for you.

3414
01:56:11,330 --> 01:56:13,200
也是最後一件事情

3415
01:56:15,580 --> 01:56:16,950
Lin Truly.

3416
01:56:15,580 --> 01:56:16,950
林真心

3417
01:56:19,450 --> 01:56:20,540
Although you're short

3418
01:56:19,450 --> 01:56:20,540
雖然你又矮

3419
01:56:21,290 --> 01:56:22,160
and stupid.

3420
01:56:21,290 --> 01:56:22,160
又笨

3421
01:56:24,700 --> 01:56:26,410
And you even like someone else.

3422
01:56:24,700 --> 01:56:26,410
還喜歡別的男生

3423
01:56:28,370 --> 01:56:29,620
Even so...

3424
01:56:28,370 --> 01:56:29,620
即使這樣

3425
01:56:31,370 --> 01:56:32,580
I still...

3426
01:56:31,370 --> 01:56:32,580
我還是

3427
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:39,870
like you a lot.

3428
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:39,870
很喜歡你

3429
01:57:02,370 --> 01:57:03,580
Lin Truly.

3430
01:57:02,370 --> 01:57:03,580
林真心

3431
01:57:06,580 --> 01:57:08,750
If you already listened to the whole tape,

3432
01:57:06,580 --> 01:57:08,750
如果你聽完這卷錄音帶

3433
01:57:11,540 --> 01:57:14,410
just look up at the sky.

3434
01:57:11,540 --> 01:57:14,410
就擡頭看看天上

3435
01:57:16,700 --> 01:57:18,870
Then I will know

3436
01:57:16,700 --> 01:57:18,870
因爲那時候我會知道

3437
01:57:20,370 --> 01:57:22,620
I'm looking at the same starry sky

3438
01:57:20,370 --> 01:57:22,620
原來我喜歡的那個女孩

3439
01:57:24,540 --> 01:57:26,370
as the girl I like.

3440
01:57:24,540 --> 01:57:26,370
正在看一樣的星空

3441
01:57:29,790 --> 01:57:32,160
I Love You.

3442
01:57:29,790 --> 01:57:32,160
Aqui te amo（西班牙文：我愛你）

3443
01:58:33,790 --> 01:58:37,160
(THE PERSON I LIKE: HSU TAIYU)

3444
01:58:33,790 --> 01:58:37,160
(我喜歡的人是徐太宇)

3445
01:58:48,410 --> 01:58:50,040
You were always wondering...

3446
01:58:48,410 --> 01:58:50,040
你常常幻想

3447
01:58:50,160 --> 01:58:52,370
what your future would be like.

3448
01:58:50,160 --> 01:58:52,370
長大後的你會是怎麼樣的

3449
01:58:52,830 --> 01:58:54,750
Now... I can give you the answer.

3450
01:58:52,830 --> 01:58:54,750
現在 我可以告訴你了

3451
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:00,540
Give me the salary

3452
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:00,540
給我該給的薪水

3453
01:59:00,660 --> 01:59:02,040
and the holidays I deserve,

3454
01:59:00,660 --> 01:59:02,040
放我該放的假

3455
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:03,620
or let me quit.

3456
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:03,620
不然你讓我辭職吧

3457
01:59:03,750 --> 01:59:07,250
I don't need to waste my life

3458
01:59:03,750 --> 01:59:07,250
人不需要在一個 不在乎你是誰的地方

3459
01:59:07,370 --> 01:59:08,870
in a place where no one cares who I am.

3460
01:59:07,370 --> 01:59:08,870
浪費自己的人生

3461
01:59:19,290 --> 01:59:20,910
Truly! Truly!

3462
01:59:19,290 --> 01:59:20,910
真心姐 · · ·

3463
01:59:21,370 --> 01:59:22,580
What the fuck!

3464
01:59:21,370 --> 01:59:22,580
哇靠

3465
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:25,410
Handwritten resignation letter... so ancient.

3466
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:25,410
這年代還有人手寫辭職信啊

3467
01:59:25,540 --> 01:59:26,790
We'd probably just send emails.

3468
01:59:25,540 --> 01:59:26,790
我們頂多發發mail

3469
01:59:26,910 --> 01:59:27,540
Who dares to

3470
01:59:26,910 --> 01:59:27,540
哪敢

3471
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:28,330
do this.

3472
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:28,330
這樣啊

3473
01:59:28,450 --> 01:59:29,790
You're so cool.

3474
01:59:28,450 --> 01:59:29,790
你太棒了

3475
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:31,410
Sometimes...

3476
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:31,410
有些事

3477
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:33,290
it's still way cooler to

3478
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:33,290
還是用我們的方式

3479
01:59:33,410 --> 01:59:34,450
do it our way.

3480
01:59:33,410 --> 01:59:34,450
比較屌

3481
01:59:34,950 --> 01:59:35,660
By the way.

3482
01:59:34,950 --> 01:59:35,660
還有

3483
01:59:35,790 --> 01:59:36,750
All of you have a share

3484
01:59:35,790 --> 01:59:36,750
我的業績獎金

3485
01:59:36,870 --> 01:59:37,700
of my performance bonus.

3486
01:59:36,870 --> 01:59:37,700
你們通通都有份

3487
01:59:37,830 --> 01:59:39,160
Yay!

3488
01:59:37,830 --> 01:59:39,160
呀

3489
01:59:44,830 --> 01:59:46,330
So you quit?

3490
01:59:44,830 --> 01:59:46,330
所以你辭職了

3491
01:59:46,910 --> 01:59:48,750
How can you be so immature?

3492
01:59:46,910 --> 01:59:48,750
你怎麼會這麼不成熟啊

3493
01:59:49,370 --> 01:59:51,160
Why can't you just be flexible?

3494
01:59:49,370 --> 01:59:51,160
爲什麼不懂得變通一下

3495
01:59:51,450 --> 01:59:53,830
Everyone can stick to it, why can't you?

3496
01:59:51,450 --> 01:59:53,830
大家都能繼續做下去爲什麼只有你不行

3497
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:55,700
Do you remember that

3498
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:55,700
你還記不記得有一次

3499
01:59:55,830 --> 01:59:57,410
once I asked you to pay card bill for me?

3500
01:59:55,830 --> 01:59:57,410
我叫你去幫我繳信用卡費

3501
01:59:57,540 --> 01:59:59,450
It's true I gave you the bill quite late.

3502
01:59:57,540 --> 01:59:59,450
我是很晚纔給你帳單沒錯

3503
01:59:59,580 --> 02:00:00,040
But it doesn't mean you could...

3504
01:59:59,580 --> 02:00:00,040
但是這也不代表你可以 · · ·

3505
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:00,750
In the future...

3506
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:00,750
長大後

3507
02:00:00,870 --> 02:00:02,620
you won't really become someone amazing.

3508
02:00:00,870 --> 02:00:02,620
你沒變得多了不起

3509
02:00:02,950 --> 02:00:04,620
You still make mistakes.

3510
02:00:02,950 --> 02:00:04,620
還是會犯錯

3511
02:00:04,750 --> 02:00:06,160
You still get confused.

3512
02:00:04,750 --> 02:00:06,160
還是會迷惘

3513
02:00:06,790 --> 02:00:09,080
You still regret for not having more ice,

3514
02:00:06,790 --> 02:00:09,080
會後悔沒多吃一點冰淇淋

3515
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:10,450
or not experiencing more relationships.

3516
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:10,450
多談幾次戀愛

3517
02:00:10,580 --> 02:00:11,790
That's what I don't like about you.

3518
02:00:10,580 --> 02:00:11,790
我已經說過好幾次我就是討厭你這樣

3519
02:00:11,910 --> 02:00:13,750
Same here.

3520
02:00:11,910 --> 02:00:13,750
我也討厭你這樣

3521
02:00:18,910 --> 02:00:20,410
Let's break up.

3522
02:00:18,910 --> 02:00:20,410
我們分手吧

3523
02:00:21,660 --> 02:00:23,870
And being too kind to people you dislike.

3524
02:00:21,660 --> 02:00:23,870
後悔沒對討厭的人更壞一點

3525
02:00:24,290 --> 02:00:26,370
And cherishing people you like more.

3526
02:00:24,290 --> 02:00:26,370
對喜歡的人更珍惜

3527
02:00:26,790 --> 02:00:28,040
But...

3528
02:00:26,790 --> 02:00:28,040
但是

3529
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:29,750
the way you are is good.

3530
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:29,750
這樣的你也很好

3531
02:00:30,580 --> 02:00:31,580
You're still very brave,

3532
02:00:30,580 --> 02:00:31,580
還是很敢

3533
02:00:31,700 --> 02:00:33,250
very naive.

3534
02:00:31,700 --> 02:00:33,250
還是很天真

3535
02:00:33,370 --> 02:00:34,450
You still...

3536
02:00:33,370 --> 02:00:34,450
還是

3537
02:00:34,580 --> 02:00:36,080
scream for your idol.

3538
02:00:34,580 --> 02:00:36,080
會爲了偶像尖叫

3539
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:38,200
Ah!

3540
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:38,200
啊

3541
02:00:42,700 --> 02:00:44,910
How can you stay so popular for 30 years?

3542
02:00:42,700 --> 02:00:44,910
爲什麼你紅了三十年還沒有過氣

3543
02:00:45,870 --> 02:00:49,790
How come I still can't get a single ticket!

3544
02:00:45,870 --> 02:00:49,790
爲什麼三十年後我還是買不到你的票

3545
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:53,950
Come on. Come on.

3546
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:53,950
快快快

3547
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:55,830
Truly glow stick!

3548
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:55,830
真心螢光棒

3549
02:00:56,040 --> 02:00:57,250
See, I finally got the ticket.

3550
02:00:56,040 --> 02:00:57,250
你看我終於買到票了

3551
02:00:57,750 --> 02:00:58,160
Where?

3552
02:00:57,750 --> 02:00:58,160
哪裏

3553
02:00:58,950 --> 02:01:00,700
I've queued for a long time!

3554
02:00:58,950 --> 02:01:00,700
排超久的你知道嗎

3555
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:02,870
I'm in the first row at the mosh pit.

3556
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:02,870
我的是搖滾區那一排

3557
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:06,000
Come on. Come on. Have a look.

3558
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:06,000
快看 快看  參考一下啦 · · ·

3559
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:09,330
Truly glow stick!

3560
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:09,330
真心螢光棒

3561
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:11,200
Come have a look.

3562
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:11,200
參考一下

3563
02:01:14,330 --> 02:01:15,450
Hello.

3564

Just treat me as an ordinary person.

3586
02:01:54,910 --> 02:01:57,250
你把我當作普通人就好了

3587
02:01:59,540 --> 02:02:00,750
Don't worry.

02:02:01,580 --> 02:02:03,500
I think you're so ordinary.

3590
02:02:01,580 --> 02:02:03,500
我覺得你超普通的

3591
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:05,040
I don't like you at all.

3592
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:05,040
我一點都不喜歡你

3593
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:06,700
I'm not your fan.

3594
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:06,700
我更不是你的粉絲

3595
02:02:15,160 --> 02:02:16,830
This is... what my colleague...

3596
02:02:15,160 --> 02:02:16,830

唱得好好哦

3603
02:02:21,750 --> 02:02:23,540
I...don't know who's the singer...

3604
02:02:21,750 --> 02:02:23,540
也 · · ·不知道是誰唱的

3605
02:02:24,160 --> 02:02:24,660
I agree.

蠻好聽的

3609
02:02:26,580 --> 02:02:28,250
Let me play another song.

3611

Although you think I'm ordinary,

3614
02:02:39,700 --> 02:02:41,160
雖然你覺得我很普通

3615
02:02:41,290 --> 02:02:42,450
and you're not my fan.

3616
02:02:41,290 --> 02:02:42,450
不是我的粉絲

3617
02:02:42,580 --> 02:02:44,250

3653
02:03:35,250 --> 02:03:37,450
You're going to the concert tonight,

3654
02:03:35,250 --> 02:03:37,450
那今天晚上你去看演唱會吧

3656

是吧

3657
02:03:38,410 --> 02:03:39,700
How do you know?

3658
02:03:38,410 --> 02:03:39,700
你怎麼知道

3659
02:03:41,410 --> 02:03:41,750
Because

3660
02:03:41,410 --> 02:03:41,750

3669
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:51,450

3699
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:38,790
Andy Lau gave me this number.

3700
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:38,790
Andy劉德華給我這個電話

3701
02:04:39,830 --> 02:04:41,580
I guess he told you about it, right?

3702
02:04:39,830 --> 02:04:41,580
他應該有交代你們吧

3703
02:04:43,370 --> 02:04:44,660
My name is.

3704
02:04:43,370 --> 02:04:44,660

02:04:44,790 --> 02:04:45,950
林真心

3707
02:04:49,540 --> 02:04:51,160
Lin Truly.

3708
02:04:49,540 --> 02:04:51,160

02:04:57,580 --> 02:04:59,160
Is sesame dressing...

3710
02:04:57,580 --> 02:04:59,160
麻醬麪

3711
02:05:00,620 --> 02:05:03,790
still separated from noodles?

3712
02:05:00,620 --> 02:05:03,790
麻醬跟面還是分開放嗎

3713
02:05:09,790 --> 02:05:11,620
The concert will start soon.

3714
02:05:09,790 --> 02:05:11,620
演唱會很快就開始了

3715
02:05:11,750 --> 02:05:12,910

I am.

3718
02:05:13,580 --> 02:05:14,870
我很期待

3719
02:05:15,620 --> 02:05:17,120
Because one of my friends made his efforts

3720
02:05:15,620 --> 02:05:17,120
因爲我有一個朋友

3721
02:05:17,250 --> 02:05:20,290
to make the concert happen.

3722
02:05:17,250 --> 02:05:20,290
他很努力的去促成這一次的演唱會

3723
02:05:20,830 --> 02:05:23,500
He wanted to fulfill a promise he made

3724
02:05:20,830 --> 02:05:23,500
他想完成自己一個年輕的承諾

3725
02:05:23,910 --> 02:05:25,450
to his first love.

3726
02:05:23,910 --> 02:05:25,450
爲了他的初戀情人

3727
02:05:27,250 --> 02:05:28,870
I like their story very much.

3728
02:05:27,250 --> 02:05:28,870
我很喜歡他們的故事

3729
02:05:30,450 --> 02:05:32,040
I want to dedicate this concert

3730
02:05:30,450 --> 02:05:32,040
這一次的演唱會

3731
02:05:32,160 --> 02:05:34,790
to everyone who has truly loved someone.

3732
02:05:32,160 --> 02:05:34,790
也希望送給所有真心愛過的朋友

3733
02:05:36,250 --> 02:05:37,370
Thank you.

3734
02:05:36,250 --> 02:05:37,370

02:05:54,910 --> 02:05:55,830
Is that you...

3738
02:05:54,910 --> 02:05:55,830
這名字

3739
02:05:55,950 --> 02:05:57,370
come up with this title?

3740
02:05:55,950 --> 02:05:57,370
是你取的哦

3741
02:06:01,370 --> 02:06:02,540
Otherwise?

3742
02:06:01,370 --> 02:06:02,540
不然咧

3743
02:06:10,950 --> 02:06:12,870
The concert is starting soon.

3744
02:06:10,950 --> 02:06:12,870
演唱會快要開始羅

3745
02:06:14,290 --> 02:06:15,290
But...

3746
02:06:14,290 --> 02:06:15,290
可是

3747
02:06:15,750 --> 02:06:17,160
I didn't get any ticket.

3748
02:06:15,750 --> 02:06:17,160
我沒有買到票

3749
02:06:18,450 --> 02:06:19,330
I'll ask...

3750
02:06:18,450 --> 02:06:19,330
我叫

3751
02:06:22,500 --> 02:06:23,750
Andy Lau

3752
02:06:22,500 --> 02:06:23,750
劉德華

3753
02:06:24,580 --> 02:06:25,870
to sing for you.

3754
02:06:24,580 --> 02:06:25,870
唱給你聽

3755
02:06:26,580 --> 02:06:27,910
Yeah right.

3756
02:06:26,580 --> 02:06:27,910
最好是啦

3757
02:06:37,160 --> 02:06:37,830
Sure.

3758
02:06:37,160 --> 02:06:37,830
好啊

3759
02:06:47,580 --> 02:06:48,790
It's been a long time.

3760
02:06:47,580 --> 02:06:48,790
好久不見

3761
02:06:53,580 --> 02:06:54,870
It's been a long time.

3762
02:06:53,580 --> 02:06:54,870
好久不見

3763
02:08:00,100 --> 02:08:02,100
《失戀陣線聯盟》草蜢

3764
02:08:15,560 --> 02:08:18,540
她總是隻留下電話號碼

3765
02:08:18,540 --> 02:08:22,290
從不肯讓我送他回家

3766
02:08:22,290 --> 02:08:26,290
聽說你也曾經愛上過她

3767
02:08:26,290 --> 02:08:29,450
曾經也同樣無法自拔

3768
02:08:29,450 --> 02:08:33,120
你說你學不會假裝瀟灑

3769
02:08:33,120 --> 02:08:36,790
卻教我別太早放棄她

3770
02:08:36,790 --> 02:08:40,700
把過去全說成一段神話

3771
02:08:40,700 --> 02:08:44,160
然後笑彼此一樣地傻

3772
02:08:44,160 --> 02:08:46,040
我們這麼在乎她

3773
02:08:46,040 --> 02:08:47,950
卻被他全部抹煞

3774
02:08:47,950 --> 02:08:49,700
越疼她越傷心

3775
02:08:49,700 --> 02:08:51,540
永遠得不到回答

3776
02:08:51,540 --> 02:08:53,290
到底她怎麼想

3777
02:08:53,290 --> 02:08:55,250
應該繼續猜測嗎

3778
02:08:55,250 --> 02:08:58,700
還是說好全忘了吧

3779
02:08:58,700 --> 02:09:02,080
找一個承認失戀的方法

3780
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:05,790
讓心情好好地放個假

3781
02:09:05,790 --> 02:09:09,750
當你我不小心又想起她

3782
02:09:09,750 --> 02:09:13,460
就在記憶裏劃一個 X

3783
02:09:28,070 --> 02:09:31,040
她總是隻留下電話號碼

3784
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:34,830
從不肯讓我送他回家

3785
02:09:34,830 --> 02:09:38,750

3786
