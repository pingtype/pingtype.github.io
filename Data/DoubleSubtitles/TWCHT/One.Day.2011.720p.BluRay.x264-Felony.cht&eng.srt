00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,270
我們沒有真正見過面

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,550
事實上 我們見面好幾次了

35
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,230
歡迎回家
Shh!Welcome home. 

36
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,990
所以辯論是好的 但任何人都可以談...
So debate is fine,but anyone can talk... 

37
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,820
只是有時候 更需要的是行動
Just sometimes,action's what's needed. 

38
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,230
改變這個世界 我完全同意

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,950
我能說著名的嗎? 超有錢?

43
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,430
你要去哪裏?
Where are you going? 

44
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,470
我只是要去 刷刷牙
I'm just gonna go brush my teeth. 

45
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,990
你知道   剛纔又吸菸又喝酒的...
You know, booze and fags and... 

46
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,060
我不介意
I don't mind. 

47
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,190
我介意
I do. 

48
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,910
好吧  很快
Listen, won't be a minute. 

49
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,830
我離開的時候 你不要那個哦
No playing with yourself while I'm gone. 

50
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,710
什麼?

51
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,310
好  集中精力
All right, concentrate. 

52
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,070
集中精力 不要搞砸這件事!
Concentrate. Do not cock this up! 

53
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,670
你要閃了?
Oh, you're going? 

54
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,670
嗯  天黑了 所以我想我可以...
Well, it's getting light out, so I thought I could just... 

55
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,710
你走吧 如果你想要走的話
You should go if you want to go. 

56
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,860
這真是太諷刺太辛酸了
It's very poignant. Very bittersweet. 

57
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,990
真的   我只是想你可能想睡了
Really I just thought you might wanna get some sleep. 

58
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,110
我不一定要走
I don't have to go. 

59
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,310
不  不 走吧 我並不擔心
No, no, go. I'm not bothered. 

60
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,830
閃人吧
Sneak off. 

61
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,060
我不是想溜走
I wasn't sneaking off. 

62
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,430
- 跳出窗口  沒關係
-Jump out the window for all I care. 

63
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,950
雖然這是五樓
It's five floors up, mind. 

64
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,070
好吧  我會留下來 好嗎?
Look, I'll stay. All right? 

65
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,790
我會留下來
I'll stay. 

66
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,270
來吧
Come on. 

67
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,100
對不起  我不擅長此道
Sorry, I'm no good at this. 

68
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,430
只是每當我跟別人上牀睡覺
It's just whenever I go to bed with someone, 

69
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,830
最後要不就是大笑 要不就大哭
I always end up either laughing or weeping, 

70
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,830
其實介於兩者之間也不錯
and it could be nice to go for something in between. 

71
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,350
瞧  這很好
Look, that's fine. 

72
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,510
是啊 也許我們 可能只能當朋友
That's fine. Maybe we could just be friends. 

73
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,310
好吧 朋友
Okay. Friends. 

74
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,030
你知道今天是聖斯威遜節嗎?
Of course, you know it's Saint Swithin's Day today, don't you? 

75
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,710
什麼?

他被安葬在溫徹斯特大教堂
Well, he was buried in Winchester Cathedral, 

79
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,750
就是我上學的地方

80
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,270

La-dee-da La-dee-da. 

82
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,150
你知道嗎 有一首詩是這樣的
You know, there's a poem. 

83
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,940
"如果在聖斯威遜節 下雨
"If on Saint Swithin's Day, it doth rain 

84
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,350
" 什麼  什麼  什麼 依然存在"
"something, something, something remain." 

85
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,230
Dexter  真有詩意
Dexter, that's beautiful. 

86
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,070
閉嘴
Shut up. 

87
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,540
讓我們睡個安穩覺
Let's get some sleep. 

88
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,190
但是  Dex
But, Dex. 

89
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,510
如果不下雨...
If it doesn't rain... 

90
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,910
...你想要做些什麼嗎?  就我和你
...do you want to do something? Me and you? 

91
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,670
-你沒事吧?  -擡起來  擡起來
- Are you all right? - Lift, lift. 

92
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,870
好  好  我來
Okay, well, I'm coming up. 

93
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,630
難道你能叫人來搬這東西嗎?
Couldn't you have just hired someone to move this stuff? 

94
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,750
不
No. 

95
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,950
如果是我的話  我會叫人幫忙
Look, I would have paid. 

96
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,230
好的  從你那邊擡起來
All right,lift from your end. 

97
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,210
顯然  你已經從來沒有做過 
You've obviously never done 

98
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:43,910
在你的生活了一天的工作
a day's work in your life. 

99
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,590
說真的  EM 我的航班在四個小時後就要飛走了
Look, seriously, Em, my plane leaves in four hours. 

100
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,110
這就更加要你來搬了
All right, well, all the more reason why you should lift. 

101
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,710
天吶
God's sake. 

102
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,980
瞧  我再幫你的忙
Look, I'm doing you a favor. 

103
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,030
我真的很  很感激
And I am so, so grateful. 

104
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,790
別再抱怨了
Stop whinging. 

105
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,630
我敢打賭  這牀可以告訴我們一些故事
I bet this bed could tell some stories. 

106
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,950
是啊  短篇小說  恐怖故事
Yeah, short stories. Horror stories.

歡迎到倫敦  把它擡起來
Welcome to London.Well, lift it. 

108
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,310
我覺得我在這會很開心的
I think I'm gonna be very happy here. 

109
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,750
那是什麼氣味?
What is that smell? 

110
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,230
洋蔥
Onions. 

111
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,910
洋蔥和失望
Onions and disappointment. 

112
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,620
對
Right. 

113
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,980
沒那麼壞吧
No, it's not that bad. 

114
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,270
沒什麼  就是掉了點油漆而已
It's nothing that a lick of paint 

115
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,630
還有個修不了的核彈頭
and a nuclear warhead can't fix. 

116
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,290
我有我的打字機 還有書 
I've got my typewriter. I've got my books. 

117
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,150
我在倫敦

118
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,500
我認爲很快會沒事的
I think it's going to be all right. 

119
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,820
我實際上可能把這些都搞定了
I might actually get things done. 

120
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,790
你知道  你會遇到很好的人的
You know, you might actually meet someone. 

121
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,860
Dexter 不要這樣

124
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,190
我告訴過你我對這些沒興趣
I told you I'm not interested in any of that. 

125
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,350
匹配的眼鏡 匹配的意見
Matching glasses, matching opinions. 

126
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,870
你要去印度了  我倒是很開心

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,310
好  因爲我正要走 我得趕上我的航班
Good, 'cause I'm leaving. I've got to catch my flight. 

128
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,990
這麼快?
Already? 

129
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,710
是啊  我很抱歉
Yeah, I'm sorry. 

130
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,710
去吧  找回自己
Well, go on then. Find yourself. 

131
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,950
繼續給我寄的這種信

132

你知道嗎  我有一種感覺

137
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,150
明年這個時候
this time next year 

138
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,790
你會像暴風般拿下倫敦
you're going to take London by storm. 

139
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,910
請問這些菜之間的區...
What is the difference between... 

140
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,310
玉米餅  是由小麥和玉米做的
A tortilla is either corn or wheat. 

141
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,310

But a corn tortilla folded and filled is a taco, 

142
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,390
而一個填滿小麥的玉米餅 就是一個玉米煎餅
whereas a filled wheat tortilla is a burrito. 

143
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,070
炸過的玉米煎餅  就是一個油煎麪捲餅
Deep fry a burrito, it's a chimichanga. 

144
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,660
烤過的玉米煎餅  就是一個烤玉米粉圓餅 
Toast a tortilla, it's a tostada. 

145
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,910
把它捲起來  就是玉米捲餅了
Roll it, it's an enchilada. 

146
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,950
可以再說一次嗎?

147
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,910
你好! 我叫 Ian . Ian Whitehead

這些傢伙不能用微波爐
What these guys can't do with a microwave 

152
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,990
和電炸鍋
and a deep-fat fryer. 

153
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,140
嘿

154
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,990
你的 美國-墨西哥 美食小組

156
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,270
豆上面是牛肉和米飯

157
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,910
一句忠告  遠離珍寶蝦
Word of warning, avoid the jumbo prawns. 

158
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,270
這就像俄羅斯轉盤  
It's like Russian Roulette. 

159
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,790
有六分之一機率要了你的命
One in six will kill you. 

160
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,990
你的專業是什麼?
So what's your stroke? 

161
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,750
我的什麼?
Sorry, my what? 

162
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,190
服務員/演員 服務員/模型  服務員/作家?
Waiter/actor, waiter/model, waiter/writer? 

163
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,870
好吧  我是一個喜劇演員
Well, I'm a comedian. 

164
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,620
喜劇演員很好 
We could use a comedian. 

165
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,070
我們都喜歡笑 我知道我過去經常笑
We all like to laugh. I know I used to. 

166
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,590
好吧   我只是剛剛真正開始
Well, I'm just starting out really. 

167
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,070
依照我 "獨特的喜劇花式"來工作
Working on my "unique comedy stylings." 

168
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,310
我不能開這麼多玩笑了  
Not jokes so much, 

169
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,030
要多工作  少廢話
more sort of wry, little observations. 

170
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,990
天吶!
Ay caramba! 

171
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,590
此刻我終於理解到一些東西
I've got this whole bit at the moment 

172
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,830
是關於男性和女性之間的差異
about the difference between men and women. 

173
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,550
當小夥子他們看到一個他們喜歡
How blokes, when they see a girl 

174
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,990
的女孩  他們就會把所有...

175
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,510
-廁所 員工廁所  -噢

如果你有興趣

在 Laffs 之家  L - A - F - F - S
At The House of Laffs, spelled L-A-F-F-S. 

180
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,100
這不是約會
It's not a date or anything. 

181
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,190
你可能已經有男朋友了  你有嗎?
You've probably got a boyfriend anyway, have you? 

182
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,030
Ian  我很想去 但下班後
Ian, I'd love to come, but after work, 

183
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,710
我想回家吃飯  一個人待着
I like to head home, comfort eat, weep. 

184
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,420
那麼你又怎麼樣   Emma ?  
So what about you, Emma? 

185
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,310
你最近忙什麼?
What's your stroke? 

186
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,310
你真正做的是什麼工作?
What do you really do? 

187
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,390
就這個  這就是我唯一的工作
Uh, this. This is what I do. 

188
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,590
不過  不會永遠做這份  對吧
Still, it's not forever, is it? 

189
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,740
我的房間還是那麼難聞  Tilly 把我氣死了 
My room still smells. Tilly's sending me mad. 

190
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,820
這房子簡直就是垃圾場
The flat's a dump. 

191
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,870
我還經常發現奶酪上有老鼠的牙印
I keep finding teeth marks in the cheese 

192
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,190
她巨大的灰色胸罩浸泡在水槽
and her big gray bras soaking in the sink. 

193
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,070
我敢肯定這不完全是場災難
Look, I'm sure it's not a complete disaster. 

194
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,590
倫敦在吞噬着我
London's swallowed me up. 

195
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,770
我想我會有所作爲 
I thought I'd make a difference, 

196
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,150
但沒有人知道我在這裏
but no one knows I'm here. 

197
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,590
聽着  好事多磨  
Listen, listen. Nothing truly good was ever easy. 

198
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,660
誰說的?
Who said that? 

199
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,340
你
You did. 

200
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,910
我有嗎?   煩死了
Did I? That's annoying. 

201
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,110
真抱歉又抱怨了  我只是... 
I'm sorry for moaning. I just... 

202
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,710
我真的想聽到的...
I really wanted to hear... 

203
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,510
教書教的怎樣?   巴黎美嗎?
How's teaching? How's Paris? 

204
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,430
還好  EM
It's good, Em. 

205
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,900
你知道的  真的  真的很滿足
You know, truly, really fulfilling. 

206
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,030
不要和你的學生上牀
Well, don't sleep with any of your students. 

207
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,190
雖然你肯定會做這種不道德的事
It's unethical and predictable. 

208
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,910
這是很好的意見  EM  謝謝
It's good advice, Em. Thank you. 

209
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,390
不過我得去跟媽媽吃午餐
But I've got to go and have lunch with Mum. 

210
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,750
那  你會原諒我嗎?
Well, apologize again, will you? 

211
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,110
我不是故意把你爸爸比喻成法西斯
I didn't mean to call your dad a fascist. 

212
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,710
資產階級的法西斯
A bourgeois fascist. 

213
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,710
對不起   Dexter ...
Say sorry and, Dexter... 

214
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,990
-我的錢都快用光了  -EM?
-My money's running out. -Em? EM? 

215
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,230
-你能聽到我嗎? -Dex ? Dex ? 
-Can you hear me? -Dex ? Dex ? Dex ? Dex ? 

216
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,990
我想你
I miss you. 

217
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,460
晚了四十五分鐘
Forty-five minutes late. 

218
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,820
是啊  我被攔路搶劫了
Yeah, well, I got waylaid. 

219
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,510
你昨晚去哪了
And where were you last night? 

220

-Was it fun? -No, it was hell. 

222
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,430
誰一直在給你寫這些信
Tell me, who's been writing you all those long letters? 

223
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,270
不管你的事
That is none of your business. 

224
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,110
那個留宿的女孩?
Was it that girl who came to stay? 

225
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,670
是啊  好吧  Emma 和我只是好朋友
Yeah. Well, Emma and I are just good friends. 

226
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,790
你究竟需要多少假期呢?
How much holiday do you need? 

227
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,630
我不是在度假  我在教英語

Isn't that Alain Delon? 

229
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,660
什麼? 哦  不  是你的父親
What? Oh, no. It's your father. 

230
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,580
正在挑他的雞眼 別這樣

231
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,070
明天帶我去吃午餐可以嗎?

232
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,740
就你和我 在一個安靜的地方
Just you and me. Somewhere quiet with white tablecloths. 

233

我想和你談談
I want to talk to you. 

234
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,060
爲什麼呢?  發生什麼事了?
Why? Is something wrong? 

235
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,460
不  沒什麼
No. Nothing's wrong. 

236
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,780
那爲什麼我們要談?
Then why do we need to talk? 

237
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,590
真的要逼我講一個理由嗎?
Do I need a reason? 

238
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,470
原來你在這 墮落的孩子
There you are. Degenerate. 

239
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,750
我想你可能需要這些
Now, I thought you might want these. 

240
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,110
謝謝  親愛的
Oh, thank you, my love. 

241
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,590
那麼晚飯吃什麼?   千萬不要是法國菜
So what's for supper? Please, God, not French food. 

242
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,820
你的白馬王子要見你  是嗎?
Golden Boy wants to see you. Hmm? 

243

244
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,630

- Have a good one. 

247
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,100
我們只是接吻
We were just kissing. 

248
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,740
你在嘗試把她整個頭塞到你的嘴裏面
You were trying to fit her entire head in your mouth. 

249
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,870
客人沒有把菜吐出來就算好了  真噁心
People have enough trouble keeping the food down as it is. 

250
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,830
她看中你什麼了
And what does she see in you, anyway? 

251
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,030
她說  我是個很深奧的人
Well, she says I'm complicated. 

252
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,910
你只是被寵壞
You're just spoiled. 

253
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,150
老闆提出要升我做經理了
I got offered the job of manager today. 

254
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,700
他們說只想要一個老實待着的人
They told me they wanted someone who wasn't going anywhere. 

255
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,830
沒事  EM  聽着 我想你應該喝一瓶龍舌蘭
All right, Em, listen. I think you should take a bottle of tequila, 

256
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,390
我想你應該走出大門
I think you should walk out the door, 

257
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,030
我不認爲你需要回來
and I don't think you need to ever come back. 

258
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,630
但我的工作就是我的全部
But my job is my life. 

259
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,790
你不能因此浪費青春
You can't throw away years of your life just because, 

260
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,830
你也覺得這很可笑
well, you think it's funny. 

261
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,150
我的頭髮聞起來就像奶酪  Monterey Jack
My hair smells of cheese. Monterey Jack. 

262
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,150
我以爲你一直是在寫詩
Look, I thought you were writing poetry. 

263
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,310
什麼  去賺錢? 我試過了 失敗了
What, go where the money is? Tried that. Failed. 

264
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,230
你就是搞不清狀況  對嗎?
You just can't see it, can you? 

265
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,150
你很有趣  你既聰明又吸引人
Look, you're funny. You're attractive. You're smart. 

266
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,230
我的意思是  你是我認識的最聰明的人
I mean, you're the smartest person I know. 

267
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,630
而且你很有魅力
Sure. You are. You're attractive. 

268
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,310
-你很性感  - 什麼?
-You're sexy. -What? 

269
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,430
什麼?  這是性別歧視麼
What? Is that supposed to be sexist or something? 

270
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,220
不  這不是性別歧視   只是很可笑
No, it's not sexist. It's just ridiculous. 

271

如果我只可以給你一件禮物

爲你的後半生準備的禮物
one gift for the rest of your life, 

274
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,470
你知不知道我會給你什麼嗎?

276
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,030
或者   蠟燭

我也應該去的 好吧
I should go, too. All right. 

284
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,390
我會沒事的   我只是覺得有點迷茫
I'll be fine. I just feel a bit lost, that's all. 

285
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,750
別這樣   每個人25歲都會迷茫
Come on, everyone's lost at 25. 

286
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,350
你就沒有
You're not. 

287
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,470
見習電視製片人  漂亮的新公寓  CD播放機

290
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,110
你知道你需要什麼 不是嗎?
You know what you need, don't you? 

291
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,750
你需要一個假期
You need a holiday. 

292
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,670
Dexter   我只是覺得我們之間需要一些規則
Look, Dexter, all I'm saying is I think we need some rules. 

293
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,310
規則!
Rules! 

294
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,790
我不想讓我們的友誼冒險  
I'm not taking any chances with our friendship, all right.

不可以喝醉以後抱抱
no drunken cuddles. 

299
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,710
我不明白爲什麼不能抱抱 
I don't see the point of cuddling, anyway. 

300
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,910
抱抱會讓你抽筋?
Cuddling gives you cramp. 

301
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,030
當你同意了   然後

我是認真的

307
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,510

Hello, what's this? 

308
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,990

好了  我不能保證

沒商量  Dex  這是規則

-No Scrabble. -I love Scrabble. 

317
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,470
所以我才說是我定的規矩
That is exactly why it's my rule. 

318
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,780
我們都還沒有死
Look, we're not dead yet. 

319

320
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,750
那是什麼?
What is that? 

321
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,190
嗯? 我的游泳前的習慣 這叫 Edwardian
Hmm? My swimming costume. It's called the Edwardian. 

322
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,790
不  這是你在給自己塗油漆
No, the masonry paint. 

323
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,470
這是防曬霜 我常常被曬傷
It's factor 30. I burn. 

324
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,510
這裏  讓我來
Here, let me. 

325
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,110
以前我還沒有見過這東西
I've not seen this before. 

326
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,710
什麼  ? 我在泰國的時候紋的
What, that? I got that in Thailand. 

327
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,630
這是  陰陽
It's a yin-yang. 

328
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,870
看上去就像一個路標
Looks like a road sign. 

329
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,630
是啊  它的意思是"完美結合的統一體"
Yeah, well, it means "the perfect union of opposites." 

330
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,950
它的意思是"該穿襪子啦"
It means "wear some socks." 

331
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,110
這弄得有點低  是不是?
This is scooped a bit low, isn't it? 

332
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,030
幸虧沒把衣服反着穿
Good job I didn't put it on backwards. 

333
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,430
我想我要去游泳了
I think I'll go for a dip. 

334
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,390
這是一個裸體主義者聚集的沙灘
This is a nudist beach. 

335
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,510
不是
No, it's not. 

336
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,910
是啊  他們在燒烤!
It is. Look. They're barbecuing! 

337
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,830
我絕對不會全裸着燒烤
You see, I couldn't do that. Barbecue naked. 

338
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,630
那是什麼? 瑜伽嗎?
What is that? Is that yoga? 

339
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,390
天吶
Oh, God. 

340
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,950
別幼稚了  繼續看你的雜誌
Grow up, all right. Back to your magazine. 

341
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,230
我可以聽到你的思想 就像是噪音
I can hear you thinking. It's like this crunching noise. 

342
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,790
我們不可以過去
The answer is no. 

343
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,910
你不覺得我們脫衣服會舒服點嗎?
Don't you think we'd feel more comfortable with our clothes off? 

344
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,710
令人難以置信 真是難以置信
Unbelievable. Just unbelievable. 

345
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,940
爲什麼不脫呢?
Well, why not? 

346
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,270
規則  更何況你有女朋友
The rules. Not to mention your girlfriend. 

347
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,750
- 什麼  Ingrid? -是啊  Ingrid
-What, Ingrid? -Yeah, Ingrid. 

348
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,830
她非常奔放
She's very uninhibited. 

349
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,710
她在簽到的桌子上脫光了上衣
She'd have had her top off at the check-in desk. 

350
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,980
那麼  照你一直說的  
Well, as you keep pointing out, 

351
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,070
Ingrid以前是模特
Ingrid used to be a model. 

352
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,510
你也可以當模特
You could be a model. 

353
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,830
目錄的模特
For a catalog or something. 

354
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,860
我還是知道你的一些東西的
I'm just saying that we're not entirely unknown to each other 

355
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,230
從生理角度上
from a physical point of view. 

356
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,430
別說了  Dex
Drop it, Dex. 

357
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,350
你知道畢業後那晚
Well, you know, that night after graduation. 

358
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,830
別這樣  你一定記得的
Come on, you must remember. 

359
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,670
不記得  就像被車撞了一樣完全失憶了
No. Blanked it out like a car crash. 

360
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,060
好吧  我沒有
Well, I haven't. 

361
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,390
事實上  如果我閉上眼睛
In fact, if I close my eyes, 

362
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,110
我仍然可以看到你當時站在暮光中
I can still see you there just standing in the dawn light. 

363
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,230
別這樣
Please don't. 

364
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,110
挑釁一樣脫掉了你的工作服
Provocatively unclasping your dungarees 

365
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,310
你向我走了過來
as you walk over to me. 

366
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,990
我沒穿工作服
I was not wearing dungarees. 

367
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,990
就是說你記得羅  呵呵?
So you do remember, huh? 

368
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,390
我擋住了太陽?
Have I caught the sun? 

369
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,830
不  你看上去...
No, you look... 

370
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,590
很漂亮
You look fine. 

371
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,870
你知道嗎  我沒有出過國
Do you know I've never been abroad? 

372
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,430
什麼?   別說笑了
What? Don't be ridiculous. 

373
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,950
這是真的
It's true. 

374
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,990
兩週前我在Whitby和爸爸在喝湯
Fortnight in a caravan in Whitby drinking Cup-a-Soup with Dad 

375
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,430
並試着不殺死媽媽
and trying not to kill Mum. 

376
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,150
我無法相信我現在和你在一起
I can't believe I'm actually here with you. 

377
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,430
爲什麼呢? 嗯?
Why? Hmm? 

378
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,830
爲什麼?
Why? 

379
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,550
當我們在大學  在我們第一次說話前
When we were at university, before we spoke even, 

380
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,060
我就對你一見傾心
I had a crush on you. 

381
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,830
-真可笑  我知道
-Ridiculous, I know. 

382
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,710
但我們快要
But when we almost 

383
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,590
內個的那天晚上
did it that night, 

384
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,550
我簡直不敢相信
I couldn't believe it. 

385
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,870
我寫詩了
I wrote poems and everything. 

386
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,350
你有什麼看法?
What have you got to say to that? 

387
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,630
好吧  我已經知道了
Well, I already knew. 

388
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,670
你知道自己在說什麼嗎?
What do you mean, you knew? 

389
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,790
好吧  我猜到了幾分
Well, I sort of guessed. 

390
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,430
所有這些史詩字母和編譯磁帶
All those epic letters and compilation tapes. 

391
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,190
所以   發生什麼事了?
So, go on then. What happened? 

392
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,500
嗯
Mmm. 

393
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,310
我認識了你 你救了我
I got to know you. You cured me of you. 

394
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,410
我還是喜歡讀那些詩 
I'd still like to read those poems. 

395
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,710
什麼詞跟 Dexter 押韻?
What rhymes with Dexter? 

396
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,260
刺破 這是半個韻
Prick. It's a half-rhyme. 

397
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,000
喝了太多酒了 我們應該回去了
Too much wine. We should go. 

398
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,990
不  不  別這麼快
No, no, no. Not yet. Not yet. 

399
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,380
我們去散步
Listen, let's go for a walk. 

400
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,590
好吧
So this is it. 

401
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,270
這真美
It's lovely. 

402
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,110
喂? 這到底是怎麼回事?
Hello? What's going on here? 

403
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,080
好吧  我想  我們應該去遊一下
Well, I thought we'd go for a quick swim. 

404
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,500
清醒一下
Sober us up. 

405
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,430
我明白了 我明白了
Ah, I get it. I get it. 

406
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,390
我中了你的圈套了  對吧?
I've walked right into it, haven't I? 

407
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,990
你讓一個女孩喝醉了   然後帶她去海邊
You get a girl drunk and lead her to a large body of water. 

408
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,350
哦  來吧  EM  你自願的
Oh, come on, Em. Be spontaneous. 

409
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,070
別想那麼多  放縱一下嘛
Be reckless. Live for the moment! 

410
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,070
來吧  EM  
Come on, Em. Get in! 

411
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,430
不!
No! 

412
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,430
你就這麼放不開 你爲什麼一直放不開呢?
You're such a prude. Why are you such a prude? 

413
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,150
你看  來!
Look, come on! 

414
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,270
你至少把內褲穿上吧
You could at least leave your underpants on. 

415
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,830
規則三  還記得嗎?
Rule number three, remember? 

416
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,390
來吧
Come on. 

417
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,270
這是裸泳?
So this is skinny-dipping? 

418
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,870
我要做什麼呢? 潑水?
What am I meant to do? Sort of lark about? Splash you or something? 

419
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,870
表情很嚴肅
That's a very serious face. 

420
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,030
你不是在內個吧
You're not having a wee, are you? 

421
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,470
不
No. 

422
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,830
不   我只想說
No, I just wanted to say that 

423
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,110
我也有一樣的感覺
I felt the same. 

424
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,470
自從我們差點內個以後
After our near-miss. 

425
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,470
當然  我沒有寫詩  我不是瘋子
I mean, I didn't write poems or anything. I'm not insane. 

426
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,390
但是  我想到了你
But, you know, I thought about you. 

427
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,750
我想你
I think about you. 

428
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,990
你和我
You and me. 

429
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,590
真的嗎?
Really? 

430
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,590
真的嗎? 
Really? Okay, well... 

431
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,740
問題是我對每一個人都有這種感覺
The problem is I fancy pretty much everyone. 

432
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,620
-我懂了  -任何人
-Oh. I see. -I mean anyone. 

433
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,430
真的  就像我剛出獄一樣  每次都這樣
Really, I mean, it's like I've just got out of prison, all the time. 

434
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,390
這是一個現實的問題 我可以想像
It's a real problem. I can imagine. 

435
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,940
是啊  但跟Ingrid有關的  就是跟性有關
Yeah, and this thing with Ingrid, it's a sex thing. 

436
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,230
這只是性愛  僅僅是性愛  完全是性愛
It's just sex, sex, sex, sex, sex. 

437
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,620
我聽懂了  Dex
The point's been made, Dex. 

438
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,260
但我和你  卻不一樣
But me and you, it would be different. 

439
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,030
我想我們會希望得到不同的東西
I think we'd want different things, 

440
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,580
我不認爲我準備好了  你懂的
and I don't think I'm ready, you know. 

441
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,300
如果你想開心點
If you wanted to, you know, have a bit of fun, 

442
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,820
享受假期  一身輕鬆
holiday fling, no obligations. 

443
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,030
天吶  我當你說"不"了  行麼
Oh, God. I'll take that as a no then, shall I? 

444
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,390
我想是這樣的 我覺得我們在一起的時刻已經過去了
I think so. I think our moment's passed. 

445
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,110
我怎麼也說不清
Come on, I'm not expressing myself clearly. 

446
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,030
不  不  你說清了  Dex 這就是問題所在
No, no, you are, Dex. That's the problem. 

447
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,510
你擔心我會在意
You're worried I might care. 

448
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,670
嘿! 嘿   回來!
Hey! Hey, Come back here! 

449
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,110
回來 你這個...嘿!
Come back, you little... Hey! 

450
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,550
小偷!  回來  回到這裏來
Thieves! Come back. Come back here. 

451
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,110
等一下!
Wait! 

452
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,990
他們已經偷了我的衣服! 你這個...
They've stolen my clothes! You little... 

453
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,390
有人幫忙叫警察嗎? 等等!  回來!
Will someone call the police? Wait! Come back! 

454
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,380
你別笑了  幫幫忙好嗎?
Could you please stop laughing and do something to help? 

455
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,390
Armani  那件衣服
Armani, that suit was. 

456
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,150
這小子 甚至把我的內褲也拿走了
The little frogs even took my underpants. 

457
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,220

Armani? Armani? 

458
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,460
不  Calvin Klein
No, Calvin Klein. 

459
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,070
哦  Dex  我很抱歉
Oh, Dex, I'm so sorry. 

460
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,710
法國鬼子!
Little French bastards! 

461
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,630
他們還把你的帆布鞋拿走了
They took your plimsolls, too. 

462
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,470
那不是帆布鞋  我從不穿帆布鞋
They're not plimsolls. I've never worn plimsolls in my life. 

463
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,470
他們連一分錢都偷 我的愛死他們了!
They were penny loafers, and I bloody loved them! 

464
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,190
什麼? 這不好笑 我犯罪的受害者
What? It's not funny. I'm a victim of crime here. 

465
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,540
什麼?
What? 

466
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,150
你那條C&K牌的內褲
Your Calvin Klein underpants. 

467
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,990
我會找到他們
I'll find them. 

468
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,670
我向你發誓 我會跟蹤他們
I swear to you, I shall track them down. 

469
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,990
進入睡眠狀態
Go to sleep. 

470
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,980
我不知道我們打破了多少條規則
I wonder how many rules we broke. 

471
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,910
全部
All of them. 

472
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,310
除了拼字遊戲
Except Scrabble. 

473
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,990
明天就會打破了
Tomorrow, maybe. 

474
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,550
誰說高清電視不行了?
Who says quality TV is dead? 

475
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,350
廣告之後更精彩
Plenty more of this when we come back after the break, 

476
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,470
所以不要走開
so do not go away. 

477
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,150
我警告你  我們知道你住的地方
I'm warning you. We know where you live. 

478
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,790
滾  離開這裏
Go on, get out of here. 

479
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,950
你看  我剛打電話讓你知道這件事
Look, I just called, all right, to let you know 

480
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,830
你是我曾經有過的最好的朋友
that you are the best friend I've ever had. 

481
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,470
我很感動  Dex  但你自己臉都看不見了
I'm touched, Dex, but you're off your face. And? 

482
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,430
你看  早上5 點了   回家吧
Look, it's 5:00 in the morning. Go home. 

483
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,710
而且你一個令人難以置信的身體
And you have an incredible body. 

484
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,500
是 Dexter ?
Is that Dexter? 

485
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,390
答應我你會回家  好嗎?
Just promise me you'll go home, please? 

486
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,230
我會  我會  我會 我會  我會  我會
I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will. 

487
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,830
Dex  你早上還要上班  Dex ...
Dex, you have work in the morning. Dex... 

488
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,390
晚安  好吧
Look, good night, all right? 

489
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,070
記住  你真的很完美
Remember, you are absolutely, truly amazing. 

490
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,910
你真了不起
You're amazing 

491
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,910
而且出名
and famous. 

492
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,630
我並不是那麼出名
I'm not that famous. 

493
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,950
最近怎麼了  老頭?
Aye, aye. How are you, old man? 

494
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,230
你母親在樓上 她早上一直在等你
Your mother's upstairs. She's been waiting all morning for you. 

495
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,190
天哪  爲什麼你出這麼多汗呢?
Good God, why are you sweating like that? 

496
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,350
今天很熱
Well, it's a hot day. 

497
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,630
不  
No, it's not. 

498
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,670
她怎麼樣?
Look, how is she? 

499
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,350
那麼  爲什麼你不自己去看看?
Well, why don't you go and see? 

500
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,340
媽媽?
Mum? 

501
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,030
你好  你好
Hello, hello. 

502
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,550
你好  陌生人
Hello, stranger. 

503
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,630
瞧  我給你買好了禮物
Look, I've got a present for you here. 

504
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,180
這不是我送的 是 Emma 送的
It's not from me. It's from Emma. 

505
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,950
在這裏  讓我來
Here, let me. 

506
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,270
謝謝
Thank you. 

507
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,190
多麼口愛
Oh, how lovely. 

508
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,870
可能是一個小小的野心
A little ambitious maybe. 

509
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,310
你可能會逼她寫短篇小說的
You might want to push her towards short stories in the future. 

510
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,270
媽媽  不
Mum, don't. 

511
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,460
你最近忙什麼?
So what have you been up to? 

512
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,050
我是 Dexter Mayhew  
I'm Dexter Mayhew. 

513
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,350
我們已經給你準備好一個很好的表演
What a show we've got for you tonight. 

514
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,430
我們已經有了一個...
We've got a man who claims... 

515
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,990
跳過這一段吧
I'll skip this next bit. 

516
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,430
接受記者採訪時 就不錯了
There's an interview that's pretty good. 

517
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,870
也許遲點會看的
Perhaps I'll watch it later. 

518
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,190
現場表演總是有點不平衡
The live show is always a bit patchy. 

519
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,470
我不明白爲什麼你要用這種聲音說話
I don't understand why you have to use that voice, 

520
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,710
但我想我不介意這樣的事情
but then I suppose I just don't care for this sort of thing. 

521
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,910
這只是一點爲孩子們準備的小樂趣
It's just a bit of fun for kids. 

522
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,230
他們都是喝完酒纔來看的
They just watch it after the pub. 

523
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,710
你的意思是我不夠醉?
You mean I'm not drunk enough? 

524
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,310
不  不是這樣的
No, it's not that. 

525
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,280
你知道  說實話  Dexter  
You know, honestly, Dexter. 

526
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,230
在籠子裏跳舞的女孩
Dancing girls in cages. 

527
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,270
這就是你乾的事?
Is this what it's come to? 

528
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,710
我只是舉辦的人
I just host it. 

529
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,470
這僅僅是達到目的的手段
It's a means to an end, that's all. 

530
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,830
但要達到什麼目的?
But to what end? 

531
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,110
我們總是說你可以做任何你想要做的事
We always said you could do anything you wanted. 

532
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,830
好 你要我做什麼?
Fine. What do you want me to do? 

533
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,750
-好事  -這就是好事
-Something good.  -It is good. 

534
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,070
我只是做本分 瞧  這就是我能做的
I just do what I'm told. Look, this is what I can do. 

535
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,310
我很抱歉
I'm sorry. 

536
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,990
這些藥讓我糜爛
The medication makes me ratty. 

537
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,430
我只需要躺下來  我今晚會好點的
I just need a little lie-down. I'll be better tonight. 

538
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,900
是啊  你知道  嗯...
Yeah, you know, um... 

539
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,830
其實  我們今晚有一場首映
Actually, I've got this premiere thingy tonight. 

540
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,150
我很抱歉 我不能錯過侏羅紀公園
Look, I'm sorry. I can't miss it. It's Jurassic Park. 

541
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,630
我怕我可能需要一些幫助
I'm afraid I'm going to need some help. 

542
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,630
你沒事吧? 來  抱着我
Are you all right? Here, put your arm around me. 

543
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,590
好了沒?
All right. All right? 

544
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,870
你沒事吧?
Are you all right? 

545
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,940
沒事
Yes. 

546
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,270
我可以給你什麼呢? 水? 幹馬提尼?
Can I get you anything? Water? Dry martini? 

547
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,230
幾點了?
What time is it? 

548
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,870

6:15 Quarter past 6:00. 

549
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,030
是的  我必須要打瞌睡了
Yeah, I must have dozed off. 

550
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,950
我怕你已經錯過了我們的一天
I'm afraid you've missed our day. 

551
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,990
你父親有點生你的氣
Your father's a little angry with you. 

552
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,590
我今晚會留下來
Look, I'll stay tonight. 

553
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,180
不  你去吧
No. You go. 

554
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,870
看着你跟你爸吵架很不爽
No pleasure for me watching you and your father snarling at each other. 

555
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,990
我能說實話嗎?
Can I speak frankly? 

556
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,310
非得說嗎?
Do you have to? 

557
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,110
我認爲這是我的特權
I think it's my prerogative. 

558
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:55,150
我知道你要當好人   體面  有愛心 
I know that you're going to be a fine man. Decent, loving, accomplished. 

559
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,510
但我不認爲你已經到達了那個水平
But I don't think you're there yet. 

560
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,510
而現在  我很擔心
And right now, well, I worry 

561
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,750
你已經不像以前那麼好了
that you're not very nice anymore. 

562
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,830
對此我真沒什麼可以說
Well, there's nothing I can say to that. 

563
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,070
你不需要說
There is nothing you have to. 

564
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,550
我不打算跟你爭論
I'm not going to argue with you. 

565
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,390
當你清醒的時候你可以來拿你的車
You can come and collect your car when you're sober. 

566
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,350
你真荒謬 我的意思是你不能沒收我的車鑰匙
You're being ridiculous. I mean, you cannot confiscate my car key. 

567
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,150
你別再侮辱我的智商!
Do not dare to insult my intelligence! 

568
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,630
你媽媽非常愛你 你知道的
Now your mother loves you very much. You know that. 

569
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,670
但是在她生命的最後時光...
But for whatever time she has left to her... 

570
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,910
如果你再敢在這種狀態下來看你的母親
If you ever, ever come to see your mother in this state again, 

571
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,190
我是不會讓你進門的
I will not let you in the house. 

572
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,620
我會請你吃閉門羹  現在...
I will close the door in your face. Now... 

573
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,820
走吧
Go. 

574
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,750
好吧
Fine. 

575
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,870
你不在   我只記得今晚你有約會
You're not there. I just remembered you're on a hot date tonight. 

576
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,870
太遲了
I'm too late. 

577
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,910
好吧  你收到這個的時候你可以給我打電話嗎?
Okay, can you call me when you get this? 

578
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,430
我只是想跟別人說說話
It's just I need to speak to someone. 

579
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,150
不是別人  是你
Not someone. You. 

580
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,910
一隻電鋸裝在手臂上  這真是瘋了
A chainsaw for an arm. It was mad. 

581
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,350
這真是驚天地泣鬼神的作品
It's a work of timeless beauty. 

582
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,740
我覺得這是最好的三部曲
It's the finest of the trilogy, methinks. 

583
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,670
而我不看 鬼玩人 頭兩部都能看懂它
And I still understood it without seeing Evil Dead I or Evil Dead II. 

584
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,110
我唯一的抱怨是這不夠暴力
My only complaint would be that there wasn't enough violence. 

585
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,620
你不介意吧  
You didn't mind, did you? 

586
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,070
你想看 藍色情挑 ?
Or did you want to see Three Colors: Blue? 

587
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,700
我要跳過開胃菜因爲我有這些玉米片
I'm gonna skip a starter because I had those nachos, 

588
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,790
但你可以繼續  你可以點任何你喜歡的東西
but you go ahead. You can have anything you like. 

589
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,830
什麼菜值14英鎊以上?
Anything up to the value of, say, 14.00? 

590
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,310
不  不  說真的  沒有
No, no, seriously, no, have anything. 

591
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,510
你知道 理性地說
Well, you know, within reason. 

592
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,590
能再次見到你真好
It's just so good to see you again. 

593
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,870
你將會成爲一個了不起的老師
And you're going to be an amazing teacher. 

594
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,630
-恭喜  -謝謝
-Congratulations. -Thanks. 

595
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,830
我希望我有更多像你一樣的老師
I wish I'd had more teachers like you. 

596
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,620
只是我還沒有做過任何工作  Morley 老師
Not that I'd have got any work done. Miss Morley. 

597
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,590
-你有沒有新的消息-
-You have no new messages.- 

598
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,550
喜劇是一個殘酷的情婦
Comedy's a cruel mistress. 

599
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,670
有時  Emma  我認爲唯一的辦法
Sometimes, Emma, I think the only way 

600
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,820
能讓我看到我的名字被投射燈照着
I'm going to see my name up in lights 

601
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,630
就是我把名字改成 "緊急出口"
is if I change it to Emergency Exit. 

602
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,660
無論如何  我今晚要即興創作
Anyway, I'm doing an improvisation night at the moment. 

603
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,390
咔咔嘻 不是他的真名
Mr. Giggles. Not his real name. 

604
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,040
但我覺得我要去堅持找更多的觀測資料
But I think I'm gonna stick to the more observational material. 

605
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,430
現在我完全明白了
I've got this whole thing at the moment 

606
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,830
貓狗之間的差異
about the difference between cats and dogs. 

607
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,510
嘿   別說了
Hey, please stop. 

608
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,820
好了 你知不知道當一個喜劇演員
Okay. Do you know what the hardest thing 

609
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,270
最難的是什麼嗎?
about being a stand-up comedian is? 

610
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,750
是它的衣服嗎?
Is it the clothes? 

611
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,270
好極了  不
Very good. No. 

612
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,030
是人們期望你在所有的時間都能搞笑
It's that people expect you to be on all the time. 

613
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,500
因爲如果你不搞笑   那麼你是什麼?
Because if you're not being funny, then what are you being? 

614
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,950
Ian  這不是表演
Ian, it's not a performance. 

615
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,910
人生就是一場表演 不是嗎?
Except it sort of is, though, isn't it? 

616
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,020
我看到你就已經這麼激動  激動過頭了
I've been so excited about seeing you. Like nervous. 

617
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,710
對不起  我...
I'm sorry, I... 

618
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,020
我也不擅長這東西  
I'm no good at this stuff, either. 

619
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,870
只是現在我已經畢業了
It's just I graduated today. 

620
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,070
我終於有資格做一些有用的東西
I'm finally, actually qualified to do something useful, 

621
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,950
而我想與人慶祝
and I wanted to celebrate with someone. 

622
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,350
Dexter 很忙嗎?
Was Dexter busy? 

623
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,620
EM  當你聽到這些  
Em, when you hear this, 

624
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,480
你能不能打車過來?
can you just get in a cab? 

625
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,670
我會幫你給錢的
And I'll pay. 

626
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:15,110
也許你甚至可以在沙發上過夜
Maybe you could even stay over, you know, on the sofa or something? 

627
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,580
我只是想見到你
I need to just see you. 

628
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,550
你能過來一下嗎?
Please, can you just come over? 

629
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,110
Emma Morley? 嗯?
Emma Morley? Hmm? 

630
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,510
我能說些什麼嗎?
Can I say something? 

631
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,350
說吧
Go on. 

632
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,990
我想你完全就是胡說八道
I think you are the absolute bollocks. 

633
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,310
你跟你的甜言蜜語
You, with your honeyed words. 

634
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,350
我也許該回家了
I should probably head home. 

635
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,630
不要走  讓我們去別的地方
Don't go. Let's go somewhere else. 

636
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,540
我住的附近  
I live near, 

637
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,120
其實我的意思是  
actually. I mean, 

638
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,230
它就像垃圾場  太可怕了
it's a dump, like, horrible. 

639
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,430
但我有音樂和酒
But I've got music and booze. 

640
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,950
或者熱的乳白的飲料   只要你喜歡
Or a hot, milky drink if you prefer. 

641
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,670
我們可以再來一杯阿華田
We could go on an Ovaltine bender. 

642
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,270
好吧  一  二  三  走!
All right. Okay. One, two, three, go! 

643
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,670
怎麼走?
Which way? 

644
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,270
這邊  這邊  這邊!
This way, this way, this way! 

645
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,270
我根本不需要   這只是友情
That's not needy. That's just affection. 

646
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,350
我只是想給予更多的愛
I've just got a lot of love to give. 

647
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,220
那麼  如果我不能給你打電話  我能來看看你嗎?
Well, if I can't call you, can I come and see you? 

648
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,150
你知道火柴都在哪裏嗎?
Do you know where the matches are? 

649
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,350
不
No. 

650
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,550
你可能要離開幾分鐘  走吧
You might wanna leave it for a couple of minutes. Go. 

651
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,350
嗨  Morley老師  嗨
Hi, Miss Morley. Hi. 

652
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,350
之後那裏將會有一個娛樂圈的聚會
There gonna be a showbiz party afterwards 

653
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,350
有香檳 小吃和清脆的笑聲嗎? 
with champagne, and canap and the tinkle of laughter? 

654
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,000
這是一個學校的戲劇表演  Ian
It's a school play, Ian. 

655
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,230
我懷疑我們可以九時半前回到家
I suspect we'll be home by half 9:00. 

656
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,370
你爲什麼不換換口味住在我家?
Why don't you stay at mine for a change? 

657
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:12,270
我會洗我的被套的
I'll wash my duvet cover. 

658
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,150
這是你的男朋友嗎  Morley小姐
Is that your boyfriend, Miss Morley? 

659
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,950
真無恥
Oy! Cheeky. 

660
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,910
問候  男孩和女孩  歡迎
Greetings, boys and girls. Welcome to the Late Night Lock In. 

661
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,990
一號攝影機  Dexter
Camera one, Dexter. 

662
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,950
表演已經吃了  生活和響亮
The show that is late, live and loud. 

663
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,030
Dexter  有位先生想見你
Dexter, gentleman to see you. 

664
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,070
注意電線  先生
Mind the cables, sir. 

665
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,030
好了  各位
Hey. Okay, ladies. 

666
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,950
我自己去喝茶吃包子
I helped myself to tea and buns. 

667
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,830
我希望我不會讓你陷入困境
I hope I'm not going to get you into trouble. 

668
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,150
我相信它會沒事
I'm sure it'll be fine. 

669
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,390
他在那兒! 嘿!
There he is! Hey! 

670

802
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,780
她確切地知道那種感覺是...
You know, she knows exactly what it's like to be... 

803
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,230
我會說" 出名"  我們恨這個單詞
I was gonna say "famous." God, we hate the word. 

804
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,870
每次我看電視轉檯
Every time I turn on the telly, 

805
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,430
她就穿着粉色橡膠緊身衣出現在我面前
she's there in a pink rubber catsuit. 

806
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,230
她的表現出乎意料的好
She's doing incredibly well. 

807
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,110
啊  是啊
Yeah, yeah. 

808
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,030
好吧  我們都是
Well, we both are. 

809
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,150
我想到了一些真的真的很令人興奮的東西
I've got some really, really exciting stuff coming up. 

810
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,910
都在醞釀當中
It's all sort of in development. 

811
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,110
如果我告訴你  我不得不開槍打死你
If I told you, I'd have to shoot you. 

812
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,590
請開槍吧
Please do. 

813
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:31,030
沒關係   別管我  好嗎?
Never mind. Start without me, all right? 

814
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,540
你好!
Hello. 

815
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,590
真有你的  好好享受吧
There you are. Enjoy. 

816
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,750
你在做無聊的事情嗎?
What are you doing, you silly thing? 

817
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,950
好吧  聽着  我們遲點再討論
Well, listen, we'll talk later. 

818
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,180
看看這華麗的外表
Look at this. This looks gorgeous. 

819
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,110
你沒事吧? 也許她可以加入我們?
Are you all right? Maybe she could join us? 

820
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,380
嘿  嘿  你在說什麼?
Hey, hey, hey, what's this? 

821
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,270
我來這裏看你  還記得嗎?
I'm here to see you, remember? 

822
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,230
對  教書教的怎麼樣了?
Right, well, how's the teaching? 

823
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,790
什麼? 如果你不感興趣   就別問
What? If you're not interested, don't ask. 

824
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,430
我很感興趣
I am interested. 

825
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,870
我只是想你正要寫這本小說
I just thought you were going to be writing this novel, that's all. 

826
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,070
我會的  但我要賺錢
And I will. But I have to earn a living. 

827
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,340
更重要的一點  我喜歡它
More to the point, I enjoy it. 

828
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:20,580
我是一個好老師  Dexter
I'm a bloody good teacher, Dexter. 

829
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,030
你絕對是
I'm sure you are. 

830
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,430
不過  你知道他們說什麼?
Still, you know what they say? 

831
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,030
不  他們怎麼說?
No, what do they say? 

832
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,350
你知道  "那些..."
You know, "Those who can..." 

833
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:32,590
不  我很抱歉  我不熟悉這些  繼續吧
No, I'm sorry. I'm not familiar. Finish the sentence. 

834
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,230
好  "有能力的人就幹一番大事
All right. Well, "Those who can, do, 

835
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,110
"沒有能力的,就跑去教書"
"and those who can't, teach." 

836
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,910
而教書的人就說 "去他媽的! "
And those who can teach say, "Go fuck yourself!" 

837
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,670
EM! EM   無論我做了什麼  我很抱歉
Em! Em, come on. Look, whatever I've done, I'm sorry. 

838
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,270
你明顯喝多了
You've obviously had a bit too much to drink. 

839
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,190
不  你醉了!  你醉了!
No, you're drunk! You're drunk! 

840
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,070
你知道三年來我沒見過你真正清醒的樣子
Do you realize that I have literally not seen you sober for three years? 

841
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,990
每10 分鐘跑去上一趟廁所
Nipping off to the toilet every 10 minutes. 

842
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,870
要麼你是在吸毒  或者你有痢疾
Either you're on coke, or you've got dysentery. 

843
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,700
無論哪種方式  都很無聊  
Either way, it's boring! 

844
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:04,830
你在浪費自己的青春
Banging on about yourself all the time. 

845
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,990
好吧  我不會介意   Dex   
Well, I wouldn't mind, Dex, 

846
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:08,830
但你是一個電視節目主持人  對吧
but you're a TV presenter, all right? 

847
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,270
你並沒有發明青黴素
You've not invented penicillin. 

848
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,230
你要做的就是站在一旁 
All you do is stand around shouting, 

849
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:12,270
喊 " 製造一些噪音吧"!
"Make some noise!" 

850
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,470
你看  我很快樂
Look, I am having fun, that's all. 

851
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,750
我最近經歷了很多
I've been through a lot recently. 

852
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:17,980
我可能會有點不在狀態
I might get a bit carried away, 

853
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,300
但如果你不停止責備我...
but if you wouldn't stop getting at me... 

854
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,550
我不是故意的  而且...
Am I? I don't mean to, and I... 

855
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,110
我知道你和你的媽媽一起經歷了很多
I know that you've been through a lot with your mum and all, I know. 

856
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,430
但有一些事情我需要你談談
But, there are things that I needed to talk to you about. 

857
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,710
關於我是如何被困在這間房子的
About how I am stuck in this flat 

858
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,350
跟一個我不愛的人住在在一起
with a man that I am not in love with. 

859
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,500
如果我不能跟你這些
And if I can't talk to you, 

860
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,750
那你在這裏又有什麼意義呢?
then what is the point of you? Of us? 

861
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,390
你是什麼意思 "這有什麼意義呢?"
What do you mean, "What's the point?" 

862
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,110
我認爲我們已經沒有共同語言了
I think we've outgrown each other. 

863
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,060
不  你已經看不起我了
No, you have outgrown me. 

864
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,470
你覺得我不夠酷  很沉悶
You think I'm uncool and dreary. 

865
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,390
我不認爲你沉悶  EM...
I don't think you're dreary. Em... 

866
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,360
我認爲如果這一切都結束了 
I think if it's over, 

867
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,110
那麼我們就應該面對事實  說再見了
then we should just face facts. Say goodbye. 

868
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,670
這聽起來像你要甩我
It sounds like you're dumping me. 

869
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,270
是啊  也許我是
Yeah, maybe I am. 

870
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,070
你已經不是曾經的你了
You're not who you used to be. 

871
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,190
來吧  EM  我道歉!
Come on, Em. Look, I apologize! 

872
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,870
請
Please. 

873
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,070
來吧 就是這樣
Come on. That's it. 

874
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,470
來
There. 

875
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:21,230
我愛你   Dexter  很深很深
I love you, Dexter. So much. 

876
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,710
我只是不再喜歡你了
I just don't like you anymore. 

877
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,310
我很抱歉
I'm sorry. 

878
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,910
Johnny Cage  獲勝
Johnny Cage wins. 

879
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,830
這是一個全能取勝王
That's an almighty win from the Blade Cruisers there. 

880
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,430
我想你們都會同意   幹得好   夥計們
I think you'll all agree. Well done, guys. 

881
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,870
今晚就到此結束   下週再見
That's all from tonight's Joy Stick Jockeys. Join us next week 

882
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,790
當我們回顧你的控制檯遊戲
when we review the smoking hot new console games coming at you. 

883
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,110
直到那時  夜貓們  繼續遊戲吧
Until then, night owls, keep gaming. 

884
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,950
我真的要說"火得冒煙"?
Do I really have to say "smoking hot"? 

885
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,510
看在上帝的份上  我都32歲了
It's just I'm 32, for God's sake. 

886
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,110
什麼  他們解僱我?
What, they're sacking me? 

887
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,470
你看   解僱這個詞有負面的含義
You see, sack has negative connotations. 

888
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,510
他們只是想嘗試錄用一個新的主持人
It's just they wanna try a new presenter. 

889
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,150
因此他們解僱我嗎?
So they are sacking me? 

890
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,270
哦  不  他們正在考慮一個不同的節目
Well, no, they're taking the show in a different direction, 

891
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,590
跟你的節目大相徑庭
but it's a direction away from you. 

892
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,030
好了  你已經沒有以前那麼上鏡了
Okay, so less you now. 

893
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,070
好了
Okay. 

894
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,950
你20歲的時候更自我
More you in your 20s. 

895
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,910
對
Right. Right. 

896
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,950
那麼  好消息是?
So, what's the good news? 

897
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,110
對不起?
Sorry? 

898
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,470
好了  你說你有一些壞消息  好消息呢?
Well, you said you had some bad news. What's the good news? 

899
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,590
每個人的事業都會跌宕起伏
Every career has its ups and downs. 

900
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,100
這僅僅是一次小小的挫折
This is just a bloody great down. 

901
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,910
我感覺自己終於醒悟了  Dexy
And I sense a bit of disenchantment, Dexy. 

902
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,230
只是有點擔心我的未來
Just a little concerned about my future. 

903
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,070
它並不完全是我期待的東西
It's not quite what I was expecting. 

904
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,350
未來是不可預測的  這就是它令人興奮的原因
The future never is. That's what makes it so bloody exciting! 

905
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,110
人人都愛你  是嗎?
Everyone loves you, yeah? 

906
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,560
但他們用一種由愛生恨的  
But they love you in that ironic, 

907
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,390
無比諷刺的方式來愛你
love-to-hate kind of way. 

908
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,070
對不對?  我們需要做的
Right? And all that we need to do 

909
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,510
就是找一個真正愛你的人
is just find someone that loves you for real. 

910
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,670
可以嗎? 是啊
Okay? Yeah. 

911
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,030
我愛你  Sylvie
I love you, Sylvie. 

912
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,310
不  不  等一下  不  我愛上你了
No, no, wait. No, I'm in love with you. 

913
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,590
你看  我從來沒有和別人說過
Look, I've never said this to anyone before. 

914
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,430
嗯  這是一個謊言 嗯...
Well, that's a lie. Um... 

915
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,230
我愛你  Sylvie 我...
I love you, Sylvie. I... 

916
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,020
Sylvie 告訴我你以前頗有名氣
Sylvie tells me you used to be quite well known. 

917
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,790
電視節目主持人還是
TV presenter or something. 

918
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,750
我以前是主持人  
I did. Yeah. Once upon a time. 

919
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,240
是的  在 Larginit臺的那個節目 
Yes, on Larginit. That program. 

920
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,160
你還記得嗎?  
 Do you remember, 

921
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:24,510
媽咪?
Mummy? 

922
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,820
你以前很討厭它的
You used to really hate it. 

923
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:26,900
是啊
Yes. 

924
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,590
"把它關掉"她老說
"Turn it off," she used to say. 

925
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,020
"關掉它  它會殺死你的腦細胞"
"Turn it off. It's killing your brain cells." 

926
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,790
那是你  是嗎?
That was you, was it? 

927
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,550
你仍然在電視臺工作嗎  Dexter ?
You still work in television, Dexter? 

928
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,320
沒有以前那麼多了  
Not so much, no. 

929
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,510
有點漸行漸遠的感覺  真的
That sort of drifted away, really. 

930
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,630
嗯
Uh-huh. 

931
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,910
Dexter  只是謙虛  他得到很多的錄用
Dexter's just being modest. He gets lots of offers. 

932
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,830

-Dexter  介不介意帶上我? -哦  不
-Dexter, care to take me on? -Oh, no. 

946

這是一個了不起的的想法
That's a terrific idea. 

947

957
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,700
天吶! 你認爲你正在做什麼是?
Good God, man! What the hell do you think you're doing? 

958
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,630
這桌子是來自意大利  我很抱歉
That table was from Italy. I'm so sorry. 

959
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,950
我必須從一個有趣的角度打到她
I must have just caught her at a funny angle there. 

960
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,830
你甚至不問她在不在那裏  Moriarty
You didn't even ask if she was there, Moriarty. 

961
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,260
我知道  我知道
I know. I know. 

962
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,070
我很抱歉  
I'm so sorry. 

963
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:04,830
你看  我不知道我在想什麼
Look, I don't know what I was thinking. 

964
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,180
看在我的份上不要換鎖了
Serves me right for not changing the locks. 

965
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,420
向好的方面看  Ian
Looking good, Ian. 

966
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,750
你可以吃飽  Emma
You can get stuffed, Emma. 

967
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,790
這就是你的行爲?
Is that from your act? 

968
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,950
沒有  雖然我最近有新東西做
No, though I have got this new thing I've been working on. 

969
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,310
天吶
God. 

970
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:29,920
我來了  
I come on, 

971
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,480
說  " 這裏有一個有趣的故事 
and I say, "Here's a funny story. 

972
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:32,430
您一定會喜歡這個"
You'll like this." 

973
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,790
Ian  "有一個人
Ian. "There's this guy, 

974
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,270
"和他的女朋友出去玩  他很愛慕她
"and he's going out with this girl, and he worships her, 

975
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,820
"他們一起買了一套房子
"and they buy this flat together. 

976
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,750
" 然後他還送了她訂婚戒指和很多別的東西
"And then he gets her an engagement ring, the lot. 

977
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:48,670
"結果卻是她還愛着她最好的朋友"
"It turns out that she is still in love with her best friend." 

978
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:49,870
這真有趣  Ian  
Interesting theory, Ian, 

979
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:51,910
只是我已經很長時間沒見 Dexter  了
except I've not seen Dexter for ages. 

980
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,710
-沒有?  -這不是原因
-No?  -That is not the reason. 

981
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:58,740
你知道他是如何發現的嗎? 他從她的詩中發現的
Do you know how he found out about it? He read it in her poetry. 

982
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,150
你這個混蛋!
You bastard! 

983
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,150
-還給我! -"我們的畢業之夜!
-Give it back to me! -"Our graduation night! 

984
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,270
" 同牀共枕"
"The erotic intensity of the shared bed." 

985
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,310
"在法國神奇的一週" 這一切都在這詩裏面
"That magic week in France." It's all here in blank verse. 

986
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,990
如果你再敢來這裏 我就打電話報警!
If you ever, ever, come in here again I will call the police! 

987
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,670
打電話給天煞的警察! 這是我的房子!
Call the bloody police! It's my flat, too! 

988
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,950
是嗎? 我付了抵押貸款!
Is it? I paid the mortgage! 

989
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,690
你只是坐在周圍放屁
You just sat around farting and 

990
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,510
看着星際迷航-可汗之怒!
watching the bloody Wrath of Khan! 

991
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,790
你愛可汗之怒
You love The Wrath of Khan. 

992
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,590
我恨可汗之怒
I hate The Wrath of Khan. 

993
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,230
幸虧我們沒有結婚
It's a good job we didn't get married. 

994
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,830
對不起我用過你所有的東西
I'm sorry about going through all your stuff. 

995
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,510
我最近有點生氣  僅此而已
I've just been a bit mad recently, that's all. 

996
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,350
沒事
It's all right. 

997
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,190
我想念你
I miss you. 

998
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,550
我知道
I know you do. 

999
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,630
就像就在這裏
Like, right here. 

1000
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,670
要麼... 我不知道
Either that, or it's trapped wind. I'm not sure. 

1001
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,870
無論怎樣  一切都會過去的
Either way, it'll pass. 

1002
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,910
你的書寫的很好
It's good, by the way. 

1003
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,510
不是詩  那些詩很糟糕
Not the poems. The poems are awful, 

1004
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,550
但其他的東西  那故事  你真好笑
but the rest of the stuff, the stories. You're funny. 

1005
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,510
適當的滑稽
Proper funny. 

1006
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,820
-不像我  -Ian
-Not like me. -Ian. 

1007
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,550
不   我只是說你應該把他們展示給別人
No, I'm just saying that you should show them to someone, 

1008
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,510
因爲你低估了自己
because you're better than you know. 

1009
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,190
哦!
Oh! 

1010
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:39,830
那是 Emma Morley 我大學同學
So that's Emma Morley. We went to university together. 

1011
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,140
你也跟她睡過嗎?
Did you sleep with her as well? 

1012
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,510
沒有
No. 

1013
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,740
那新娘呢?
What about the bride? 

1014
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,710
不  天吶  你在說什麼?
No. God, what is this? 

1015
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,310
每個週末我們都會去一個婚禮
It's just that every weekend we go to a wedding 

1016
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,990
跟你睡過的能裝下一車了
with a coachload of people that you've slept with. 

1017
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,390
這就像一個會議
It's like a conference. 

1018
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:55,740
好了 來吧
Okay. Come on. 

1019

你知道你是我的唯一
You know you're the only one for me now.

公平貿易的咖啡
Fair Trade coffees. 

1023
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:15,260
小龍蝦  Dex  人們都爲這小傢伙發瘋 
Crayfish. Dex, people go crazy for the little buggers. 

1024
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,660
我已經得到了12家分行了 年底會有另外12 家
I've got 12 branches already. Twelve more by the end of the year. 

1025
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,270
最近我聽到一些謠言
Well, you know, there's a rumor going around 

1026
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:23,990
說其實你是超有錢的人
that you're actually a multi millionaire. 

1027
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,790
不是吧
Come on. 

1028
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,310
怎樣才叫超有錢
Well, define multi. 

1029
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,950
你應該來吃午飯  我們應該談
You should come and have lunch. We should talk. 

1030
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,430
什麼  你想給我一份工作嗎?
What, are you offering me a job? 

1031
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:37,990
不   我只是說...
No, I'm just saying... 

1032
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,510
你給我一份工作  對吧?
You are, aren't you? You're offering me a job. 

1033
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,030
你看  我沒見過你 電視上一段時間
Look, I haven't seen you on telly for a while. 

1034
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,070
我想如果你想要一個新的開始...

Callum   夥計

At university, you wore the same pair of jeans for... 

1037

穿了大概  4年?
What was it, four years? 

1038
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,270
很久以前的事了
Long time ago now, pal. 

1039
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,550
我們已經不是學生了
We're not students anymore. 

1040
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,860
似乎有人要享受它
Someone seems to be enjoying it. 

1041
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,100
瞧  看看這裏
Look, look over here. 

1042
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,750
你有沒有 見過 Emma Morley?

一直就在我們眼前 啊?

誰知道?
Who knew? 

1045
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,110
我靜靜坐着  默默等待
I sit and wait 

1046

在考慮着我的命運
Contemplate my fate 

1048
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,500
他們是否知道
Do they know 

1049
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,710
我告訴你  一個發現改變了我的生活

我告訴 Dexter 他會有很多機會
I was telling Dexter there's plenty of opportunities. 

1054
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,380
親愛的  我很快會回來的
Darling, I'll be back in a bit. 

1055
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,910
你想一些香檳嗎?
Do you want some champagne? 

1056
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,380
這不是香檳  是西班牙語
It's not champagne. It's Spanish. 

1057
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:51,470
當我趴在我的牀上的時候
When I'm lying in my bed 

1058
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:54,470
思緒緩緩飄過我的腦海

1060
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,950
我愛的是天使

Yes, please. 

1063
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,150
她通過這一切提供我保護
And through it all She offers me protection 

1064
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,750
很多憐愛
A lot of love and affection 

1065
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:16,190
跟新娘睡過  讓你覺得今天很難過吧
Today must be quite tough for you, having slept with the bride. 

1066
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:20,150
我不知道你在說什麼
I don't know what you're talking about. 

1067
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,550
什麼? 你怎麼知道所有這些事情的
What? How do you know all these things? 

1068
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,470
Tilly 告訴我所有關於它的事了嗎?
Tilly told me all about it. Oh, did she? 

1069
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:28,510
足部按摩到一半兩人都失控了
The foot massage spun out of control. 

1070
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,190
我想你甚至用了我的橄欖油
I think you even used my olive oil. 

1071
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,950
腳印踩到了廚房牆壁上
Footprints halfway up the kitchen wall. 

1072
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,430
嗯  我已經沒再想這些了  所以...
Well, that stuff's behind me now, so... 

1073
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,830
說真的   什麼事?
Really, what happened? 

1074
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,590
在洗手間內個已經沒有感覺了麼?
Sex in toilet cubicles lose its bittersweet charm? 

1075
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,270
狂歡不會讓你在夜裏感到一絲溫暖  Emma
Well, an orgy won't keep you warm at night, Emma. 

1076
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,190
當你老的時候狂歡不可能照顧你
An orgy won't look after you when you're old. 

1077
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,590
說得好
Well said. 

1078
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,070
無論如何  我搞砸了我的職業生涯
Anyway, I screwed up my career. 

1079
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,230
搞砸了媽媽的事情
And screwed up things with Mum. 

1080
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,790
事實並非如此
That's not true. 

1081
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:03,060
而我搞砸了我跟她的友誼
And I screwed up my friendships. 

1082
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,580
然後Sylvie剛剛來到我身邊
And then Sylvie just came along. 

1083
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,630
她算是救了我  真的
And she sort of, well, saved me, really. 

1084
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,870
她很漂亮
She's very beautiful. 

1085
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:20,590
當然  她絕對沒有幽默感
Of course, she has absolutely no sense of humor. 

1086
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,790
差不多吧  他的幽默一直被高估了
Just as well. A sense of humor's overrated. 

1087
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,030
像傻瓜一樣總是在身邊
Goofing around all the time. 

1088
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,270
唯一一次伊Ian 真的讓我笑起來
The only time Ian ever really made me laugh 

1089
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,870
就是當他從樓梯上掉下來的時候
was when he fell down the stairs. 

1090
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:32,910
Sylvie  你知道  她不喜歡笑
Well, you know, Sylvie says she doesn't like to laugh. 

1091
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,270
真的不太喜歡她不笑的樣子
Doesn't really like what it does to her face. 

1092
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,550
但你愛她  對?
But you love her, right? 

1093
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,430
是啊  我崇拜她
Yeah, I worship her. 

1094
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:56,190
我愛 Colin
I'm loving Colin instead 

1095
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,020
哦  不  不  這邊走
Oh, no, no. This way. 

1096
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,470
我們去哪兒?
Where are we going? 

1097
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,550
哦!
Oh! 

1098
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,190
來吧  是吧?
So, come on, then. You, huh? 

1099
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,070
浪漫嘛?
Any romance? 

1100
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,630
不要說這種東西  Dex
Don't start, Dex. 

1101
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:21,700
什麼?
What? 

1102
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:25,710
同情的話  我孤獨但不孤單
Your sympathy. I'm not lonely. I'm alone. 

1103
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,550
那裏  聽起來怎麼樣?
There, how'd that sound? 

1104
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,590
啊  是啊  我買了
Yeah, yeah. I bought that. 

1105
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,900
這是真的
It's true. 

1106
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:36,350
這本書讓我感覺自己稍微有點進步了
I've got a tiny advance to write this book. 

1107
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:46,790
其實我也有事要告訴你
Well, you know, I have something to tell you, too. 

1108
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,790
你要結婚了
You're getting married. 

1109
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,390
是啊
Yeah. 

1110
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:02,790
你高興嗎?
So, you're pleased? 

1111
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,110
我當然很高興  Dex   太好了
Of course I'm pleased, Dex. Fantastic news, really. 

1112
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,630
是香味嗎?  你的婚禮邀請函很香
Scented? Your wedding invitations are scented. 

1113
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,630
是啊  薰衣草
Yeah, lavender. 

1114
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,790
Dex  它的錢  他們聞到錢的味道了
No, Dex, it's money. They smell of money. 

1115
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:23,590
8月14日?
August 14th? 

1116
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:27,300
是的  我認爲這就是  強婚
Yeah, I think that's what they call a shotgun wedding. 

1117
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,550
爲了350
For 350. 

1118
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,750
自助的
With buffet. 

1119
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,190
你知不知道父親是誰?
Do you know who the father is? 

1120
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,670
停止它
Stop it. 

1121
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,590
我開玩笑
I'm kidding. 

1122
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:51,710
恭喜你
Congratulations. 

1123
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:52,780
謝謝
Thank you. 

1124
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,430
爸爸  我知道
A dad. I know. 

1125
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,430
可以這樣? 他們會讓你這樣做?
Is that allowed? Will they let you? 

1126
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,590
真是不可思議  對嗎?
It's incredible, isn't it? 

1127
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,830
你會成爲一個很好的父親
You're going to be a wonderful father. 

1128
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,350
你真的這麼認爲嗎?
Do you really think so? 

1129
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,150
確定一定以及肯定
I don't doubt it for a minute. 

1130
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,830
我想念你  Dex
I missed you, Dex. 

1131
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,830
好吧  我也很想你
Well, I missed you, too. 

1132
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,310
不要再突然消失
No more disappearing. 

1133
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,150
好  我不會再消失  如果你不會
No, well, I won't if you won't. 

1134
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:40,910
-嗯? -恩
-Mmm?  -Mmm. MMM? 

1135
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,990
我們該回去了
We should go. 

1136
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:02,270
當然可以  我們走吧
Absolutely, let's go. 

1137
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:11,030
別這樣  Jasmine  別這樣
Come on, Jasmine. Come on. 

1138
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:15,990
別這樣   別哭了好嗎?
Come on. You gonna stop crying? 

1139
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,260
你最近怎樣?
How you getting on? 

1140
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,310
好  是啊  是啊
Good, mate. Good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

1141
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,620
不太符合我所期待  但...
Not quite what I was expecting, but... 

1142
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,740
你是什麼意思?
How do you mean? 

1143
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,790
好了  你看到有機及自制這幾個字了...
Well, you see the words organic and homemade... 

1144
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,870
我知道 你在想象有幾個嬉皮士
Yeah, I know. You imagined a couple of hippies 

1145
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:50,790
在某個小農場  生產自己的麥片
on a little farm somewhere, knitting their own muesli. 

1146
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,870
好主意  但這是商業  Dex
Nice idea, but this is business, Dex. 

1147
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,190
-我明白了 -這是你的最後兩個
-Yeah, well, I realize that. -Here's your last two. 

1148
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:59,950
聽着  你只在這裏學習竅門的  好嗎?
Listen, mate. You're only here to learn the ropes, okay? 

1149
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:01,550
公司的政策   每個人都必須遵循
Company policy. Everyone has to. 

1150
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,940
Callum   我喜歡它

1151

老實說  我很好

還有很多奶粉剩呢

我已經做好蔬菜泥了 
I've pureed the veggies, 

1154
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,390
或者你也可以加一個香蕉
or you could mash a banana. 

1155
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:16,150
印度菜怎麼樣? 我可以給她一塊咖喱呢
And what about Indian food? I can give her a curry, can't I? 

1156
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,390
不  不  不  Dexter  不

哦  我明白了
Oh, I see. 

1159

I keep missing those, don't I? 

1160
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,990
我很抱歉我來晚了
I'm sorry. It's just that I'm late.

I don't even know why I'm going.

-I'm too old for hen nights. -No, you're not. 

1163

我叫的出租車來了
That's my cab. 

1164
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,140

I'll be fine. I'll be fine.

聚會開始了就沒有盡頭
Party started there's no end in sight 

1175
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,430
每個人都翩翩起舞
Everybody's moving to the rhythm that's inside 

1176
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:13,670

It's a crazy world but tonight's the right situation 

1177

她說話是不是很大聲嗎?
Isn't she loud? 

1185
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,870
你能讓他們都擠到鏡頭前嗎
Can you even fit them in a two-shot? 

1186
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,590
他們是如此高大   以至於我幾乎融化在這裏
They are so tall. I'm practically melting over here. 

1187
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,390

嗯...
Um... 

1198
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,950
我們全都要去俱樂部  她怎麼樣了?
We're all going on to some club. How is she? 

1199
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,790
睡着了   終於
Asleep. You know, finally. 

1200
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,190
這段時間她一直醒着?
She's been awake all this time? 

1201
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:25,190
是啊  我的錯  我應該給她脫咖啡因的
Yeah, my fault. I should have given her the decaf. 

1202
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,470
看到了嗎?  我讓你笑
See? There you go. I made you laugh. 

1203
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,510
你沒事吧?
Are you all right? 

1204
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:35,870
是啊  不  不  我很好  我很好
Yeah. No, no, I'm good. I'm good. 

1205
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,100
爲什麼呢? 你是不是在擔心?
Why? Were you worried? 

1206
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,340
哦  不  嗯...
Oh, no. Um... 

1207
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,390
沒有理由   我只是...
No reason. I just... 

1208
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,310
好吧   我只是想確認一下你和...
Well, I was just checking up on you and... 

1209
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:46,750
好了  一切都很好
Well, everything's fine. 

1210
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:49,030
好吧
All right. 

1211
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,710

Sylvie Look, Sylvie, 

1212
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:56,790
我知道我不擅長這個  當爸爸和丈夫的事情
I know I'm not good at all this, you know, dad/husband thing. 

1213
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,300
你做得很好   Dexter
You're doing fine, Dexter. 

1214
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,390
不  我知道如果你有一份收入
No, and I know if you had a receipt, 

1215
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,750
你會帶我回到很久以前
you would have taken me back a long time ago. 

1216
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:09,870
但是 我正在解決好嗎?  耐心等一下吧
But, you know, I'm working on it, all right? So bear with me. That's all. 

1217
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,750
我要掛電話了
I've got to go. 

1218
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,030
明天見 
I'll see you tomorrow. All right. 

1219
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,070
再見  晚安
Night. Good night. 

1220
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:21,870
好笑嗎?
Funny? 

1221
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:22,980
非常有趣
Very funny. 

1222
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:28,510
看看你  你甚至看起來像一個作家
Well, look at you. You even look like a writer. 

1223
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,150
一個在巴黎的作家
A writer in Paris. 

1224
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,190
是不是有一個詞專門形容這個的?
There's a word for this, isn't there? 

1225
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:36,070
嗯  Butch
Uh, butch. 

1226
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,870
我本來想說 gamine
I was gonna say gamine. 

1227
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,860
你看起來又是什麼樣子?
What do you look like? 

1228
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:41,910
我?  一個搞砸了的離婚者
Me? A screwed-up divorce? 

1229
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:48,270
我的公寓就在不遠處?我們可以...
So my apartment's not far. Shall we? 

1230
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,510
你會留在這裏多久?
How long are you staying for? 

1231
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:53,670
我想這由你決定  真的...
I suppose it's up to you, really. It's just... 

1232
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,350
我只是想說點什麼
Look, I just wanted to say something 

1233
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,230
說一些在電話裏說不出口的事
which I couldn't really do over the phone. 

1234
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,510
好了  自從我們最後一次在倫敦見面以來...
Well, ever since we were last together in London... 

1235
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,790
Dexter  你說別的之前  我...
Dexter, before you say anything else, I have to... 

1236
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,510
有些事情我要告訴你
There's something I have to tell you. 

1237
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,620
你去約會了!
You've met someone! 

1238
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,550
這很難以置信嗎?
Is that really so hard to believe? 

1239
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:15,470
-一個人嗎? -是的  一個人 一個傢伙
-A man? -Yes, a man. A guy. 

1240
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:18,430
一個傢伙! 他現在是男人了是吧? 我懂了
A guy! He's a guy now, is he? I see. 

1241
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,690
他叫 Jean-Pierre  
He's called Jean-Pierre, 

1242
01:14:19,690 --> 01:14:21,230

Jean-Pierre Dusollier  Jean-Pierre Dusollier. 

1243
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:22,510
什麼  他是法國人嗎?
What, he's French? 

1244
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,710
不  Dex  他是威爾士人
No, Dex, he's Welsh. 

1245
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,710
他的帥氣  他的迷人  
He's handsome. He's charming. 

1246
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:29,160
他只是非常  非常法國
He's just very, very French. 

1247
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:31,070
什麼  你的意思是粗魯?
What, you mean rude? 

1248
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,710
不  囂張?
No. Arrogant? 

1249
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,750
抽菸太多了  戴着一串洋蔥
Smokes too much, wears a string of onions. 

1250
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,990
你爲什麼要這樣?
Why are you being like this? 

1251
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,750
哦  你的意思是性感嗎? 
Oh, God, you mean sexy. Is that what you mean? 

1252
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:39,910
你在跟很多人內個?
You're having lots of sex? 

1253
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,630
從什麼時候開始我需要徵求你的許可?
Since when do I need to ask your permission? 

1254
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:43,190
誰會知道啊  你從來也不徵求我的許可
God knows you never asked mine. 

1255
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,870
但我們只是睡在一起
But we just slept together. 

1256
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,070
我沒有忘記
I haven't forgotten. 

1257
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,830
Dexter  我們有點醉了
Dexter, we got a bit drunk. 

1258
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,510
是啊  但沒那麼喝醉了
Yeah, not that drunk. 

1259
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,470
你把你的褲子脫了放在你的鞋子上
You took your trousers off over your shoes. 

1260
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,070
不  我沒有
No, I didn't. 

1261
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:06,540
我有嗎?
Did I? 

1262
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,310
我以爲你在爲Sylvie和離婚的事煩惱
I think that you were upset about Sylvie and the divorce, 

1263
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,790
而你需要在一個肩膀上哭
and you needed a shoulder to cry on. 

1264
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,430
或者睡在那上面
Or sleep with. 

1265
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:18,060
而這就是我  陪睡小姐
And that's what I was, a shoulder to sleep with. 

1266
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,780
這就是你這樣做的原因對吧? 
And that's why you did it, was it? 

1267
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:20,910
爲了讓我精神振奮起來
To cheer me up. 

1268
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,140
反正這奏效了
Well, it worked, didn't it? 

1269
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:33,660
那是我生命中最美好的夜晚之一
If you must know, it was one of the better nights of my life. 

1270
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:34,980
看到了嗎?
See? 

1271
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,550
表醬紫
Don't fish. 

1272
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,030
Dex   只有一次
Dex, it was one time. 

1273
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:45,790
纔不是  三次了
Well, it was three times. 

1274
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,990
來吧  你看  你不覺得這是一個好主意?
Come on. Look, you don't think it's a good idea? 

1275
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,790
你和我兩個人在一起
You and me. 

1276
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:58,030
是啊  我一直這麼認爲
I do. I did. 

1277
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,230
在80年代後期
In the late '80s. 

1278
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,350
對
Right. 

1279
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:06,070
最好動身了
Better get going. 

1280
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,550
爲什麼呢? 我們要做什麼呢?
Why? What are we doing? 

1281
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:08,990
Jean-Pierre 想見你
Jean-Pierre wants to meet you. 

1282
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,390
哦  你在開玩笑
Oh, you're kidding. 

1283
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,430
我們要聽他彈奏
We're going to hear him play. 

1284
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:13,550
彈奏?
Play? 

1285
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:14,620
他是爵士樂音樂家
He's a jazz musician. 

1286
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:17,420
壞小子
Bastard. 

1287
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,470
我們要聽他用鋼琴彈上九個小時爵士樂
We're going to listen to him play free jazz on the piano for about nine hours, 

1288
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,310
會很有樂趣的 根本不會尷尬
and it's going to be lots of fun and in no way awkward. 

1289
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,550
你不是要這樣走出去吧?
You're not going out like that, are you? 

1290
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,310
別廢話了
Just do me up. 

1291
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,270
那就是 Jean-Pierre
That's Jean-Pierre. 

1292
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,500
哪個?
Where? 

1293
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:07,870
噢   你至少可以找一個好看點的
Oh, God. You could have at least found someone a bit good-looking. 

1294
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,640
你知道  EM  我敢肯定他是一個
You know, Em, I'm sure he's a 

1295
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,110
很好的爵士樂鋼琴家
fine jazz pianist. 

1296
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,310
我只是不確定我可以這樣做
I just don't think I can do this. 

1297
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,470
哦 真的嗎?
Oh. Really? 

1298
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:24,070
是啊  我想我還是是去看電影   然後回公寓
Yeah, I'll just go and see a movie and go back to the apartment. 

1299
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:27,710
然後我想我要去搭明天第一趟火車回去
And then I think I'm going to get the first train back tomorrow. 

1300
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,070
你不一定要離開
You don't have to leave. 

1301
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,510
我覺得我要
I think I do. 

1302
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,590
對不起  Dex
I'm sorry, Dex. 

1303
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:41,030
嘿  不要這樣
Hey, don't be. 

1304
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,580
去吧
Go on. 

1305
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,270
嘿  你好
Hey. Salut 

1306
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,870
等等!  Dexter !
Wait! Dexter! 

1307
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:16,950
我以爲我已經不在意你了
I thought I got rid of you. 

1308
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,910
如果你耍弄我  Dexter ...
If you muck me about, Dexter... 

1309
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,990
EM  我發誓 我發誓  我不會
Em, I swear. I swear I won't. 

1310
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,270
引誘我  或者讓我失望  或着暗算我
Lead me on, or let me down, or go behind my back, 

1311
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,500
我會殺死你的
I will murder you. 

1312
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:38,630
我不會這樣做
I won't do that. 

1313
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,150
你發誓?
You swear? 

1314
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:46,910
是的  我發誓 我發誓
Yeah, I swear. I swear. 

1315
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,910
我想感謝大家百忙中抽空來我們的婚禮
I would like to thank everyone for coming to our wedding. 

1316
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,190
這隻能形容爲旋風式的浪漫
For what can only be described as a whirlwind romance. 

1317
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:16,420
笑聲停止
Pause for laughter. 

1318
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:24,710
說真的  當人們問Emma和我第一次是怎麼遇見的
Seriously, when people ask how Emma and I first met, 

1319
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,750
我就告訴他們我們一起長大
I tell them that we grew up together. 

1320
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,910

Blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah. 

1321
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,990
你不會說內個的那一天吧?
You're not going to say, "Blah, blah, blah," on the day, are you? 

1322
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,270
你不應該聽到這個的
You are not supposed to be hearing this. 

1323
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:34,470
如果我有注意到怎麼辦?
What if I have notes? 

1324
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:35,710
來吧  讓我看看
Come on, let me see. 

1325
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,270
不要
No, no. 

1326
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,550
當我們結婚的時候  你要絕對服從我
When we're married, you're going to have to obey me. 

1327
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:42,230
是的  我敢肯定這將要發生
Yeah, I'm sure that's going to happen. 

1328
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:46,910
什麼? 不是嗎?
What? Not again? 

1329
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,430
你介意嗎?
You don't mind, do you? 

1330
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,030
不  我不介意
No, I don't mind. 

1331
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:54,750
雖然有健康和安全問題
Although, there are health and safety issues. 

1332
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:57,710
我可能會失去我的駕照的
I could lose my license. 

1333
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,430
他們肯定不知道我們去哪裏了
They'll wonder where we've got to. 

1334
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,460

MMM!  Mmm! Mmm. 

1335
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:26,670
我可以肯定的這是燒焦的味道
I can definitely smell burning. 

1336
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,670
你好  
Hello, hello. 

1337
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:32,940

來這裏  我們走吧
Come here, you. Here we go. 

1339
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:38,670
你想給我一個吻嗎? 親我吧
Do you want to give me a big kiss? Give me a big kiss. 

1340
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,510
繼續
Go on. 

1341
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,390
看電視只能從5:30看到6:00
TV between 5:30 and 6:00, but no more. 

1342
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,310
而她7點半一定要上牀
And she has to be in bed by 7:30. 

1343
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,310
好  你想跑進去?
All right, do you want to run inside? 

1344
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:48,870
去看看 Emma  好女孩
Go see Emma. Good girl. 

1345

我在這裏  Jasmine

她現在很喜歡來這裏
She's loving coming here at the moment. 

1347
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,030
好  很好  非常好
Well, good. That's great. 

1348
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:56,750
我真爲你高興
I'm really pleased for you. 

1349
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,350
我會邀請你進來 這...
Look, I'd invite you in. It's just... 

1350
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:01,750
不  沒事  我們要去看看我的家人了
No, it's fine. We've got to go and see my family. 

1351
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,510
玩得開心點  謝謝
Have fun. Thanks. 

1352
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,470
-Dexter?  - 怎麼了
-Dexter?  -Yeah. 

1353
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,390
我一直在想一件事
I've been thinking. 

1354
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,070
我也有
So have I. 

1355
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:37,190
我想與我愛的男人要一個孩子 
I want a child with the man I love. 

1356
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:42,790
如果他不想要孩子  那我和你生一個吧
And if he won't do it, then I want one with you. 

1357
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,470
好吧  那我們最好現在開始
Well, then, we'd better get started. 

1358
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:37,230
我看上去真疲憊
I look so tired. 

1359
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,670
所以纔要多鍛鍊  遲點來跟我游泳吧
So take some exercise. Come swimming with me later. 

1360
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,150
不  不  我不能 我在咖啡館有太多事忙了
No, no, I can't. I've got to do too much at the cafe. 

1361
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,830
好 不要
Fine. Don't. 

1362
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:48,580
順便說一下  我知道你很八卦  
By the way, in case you're interested, 

1363
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:49,750
事實上我沒有懷孕
I'm not pregnant. 

1364
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,430
EM  你怎麼知道?
Em, how do you know? 

1365
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,110
你怎麼想的?
How do you think? 

1366
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,830
但我們可以再試一次
We could try again, though. 

1367
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:02,310
來吧  看着... 不  不  不  不 來吧
Come on, look... No, no, no, no. Come on. 

1368
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:07,110
我很抱歉  好嗎?
Look, I'm sorry. All right? 

1369
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,740
不  我沒有怪你
No, I am for taking it out on you. 

1370
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,910
我們一直狀態不佳?
We're not at our best today, are we? 

1371
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:23,550
聽着  要不我們下班後見面吧?
Listen, why don't we meet each other after work? 

1372
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:26,870
然後去電影院看電影  你挑電影吧
We'll go to the movies. Your choice. 

1373
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,870
看有字幕的
Something with subtitles. 

1374
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,310
哦
Ooh.

01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:33,910

And we can go and have some dinner. Just you and me, 

1376
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,990
再然後我們就解決這個問題  好嗎?
and we can work this out. All right? 

1377
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,430
-我保證 -Mmm-hmm.
-I promise.  -MMM - HMM 

1378
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:40,910
是啊
Yeah. 

1379
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,140
好了
Okay. 

1380
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:27,870
謝謝 非常感謝
Thank you. Thanks a lot. 

1381
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:35,250

Hey, there. Just to say I'm running late, 

1382

1392
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:41,150
- Dexter ? 你好  親愛的
- Dexter ? Hello, darling. 

1393
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:50,750
你沒事吧? 去穿衣服
Are you all right? Go and get dressed. 

1394
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:52,150

Sylvie, Sylvie, 

1395
01:28:52,150 --> 01:28:52,510

Dexter? Dexter ? Sylvie, Sylvie. 

1396
01:28:52,510 --> 01:28:53,270

Dexter? Dexter ? 

1397
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:56,670
Sylvie  Sylvie  我搞砸了
Sylvie, Sylvie, I screwed up. 

1398
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:57,820
Jasmine  現在就去!
Jasmine, now! 

1399
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,590
我搞砸了
I screwed up. 

1400
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:01,310

1406
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,550
你這個可憐的東西
You poor thing. 

1407
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:26,420
噢  上帝  Dexter
Oh, God. Dexter. 

1408
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:12,150
- 由於今日連續降雨 水位開始回升
-As the rain came down,the water levels began to rise. 

1409
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:17,830
那麼這將是一個一年一度的節日  你覺得呢?
So is this going to be an annual festival, do you think? 

1410
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,830
每年7月15日?
Every year, 15th of July? 

1411
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,910
好吧  我希望不會
Well, I hope not. 

1412
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,430
我不想  談心
I don't want a heart-to-heart. 

1413
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:30,940
你呢?
Do you? 

1414
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,750
不  我寧可不談
No, no. I'd rather not. 

1415
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:37,590
只是說  我覺得你應該做的最好的事
Except to say, that I think the best thing that you could do 

1416
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:43,790
就是像 Emma 還在你身邊那樣繼續生活下去
would be to try to live your life as if Emma was still here. 

1417
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:47,830
不是嗎?
Don't you? 

1418
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:55,100
我不知道我能不能
I don't know if I can. 

1419
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,550
當然你也可以
Of course you can. 

1420
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:04,070
你覺得我最近10年都做了什麼?
What do you think I've been doing for the past 10 years? 

1421
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:17,630
現在是9點 Silent Witness 要開始了
Now Silent Witness is on. 9:00. 

1422
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,230
對
Right. 

1423
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:37,990
Ian 上帝!
Ian. God! 

1424
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,830
嗨 你好
Hi. Hello, mate. 

1425
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:43,300
你呢? 是啊  看看這個
Are you well? Yeah, look at this. 

1426
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,830
所以  你最近怎樣?  脫口秀怎麼樣?
So, how are you? How's the stand-up comedy? 

1427
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:48,750
我放棄那個了
Oh, well, I gave that up, actually. 

1428
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:49,910
這真可惜
That's a shame. 

1429
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,510
不  因爲我從來都不擅長這個
No, not really, because I was never any good. 

1430
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,510
我唯一的一次讓 Emma 笑
The only time I ever made Emma laugh 

1431
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:58,060
就是當我從樓梯掉下去的時候
was when I fell down the stairs. Really. 

1432
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:01,390
不  我現在賣保險
No, I'm in insurance now. 

1433
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:03,590
太好了
Great, great. 

1434
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:11,350
我討厭今天 七月十五月
I hate today. Fifteenth of July. 

1435
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:15,590
聖斯威遜節
Saint Swithin's Day. 

1436
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,230
這是一個艱難的聖斯威遜節
It's a tough one. 

1437
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:21,000
我以前從來沒有注意過它  
I never noticed it before, 

1438
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,890
但它是總是在那裏靜靜守候  
but it was always there just waiting, 

1439
01:32:23,890 --> 01:32:24,310
潛伏
lurking. 

1440
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:28,030
我以前也很恨你 
I used to hate you, too. 

1441
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:29,990
很暴力  Dexter  
Quite violently, actually, Dexter. 

1442
01:32:29,990 --> 01:32:31,470
我很抱歉  但...
No, I'm sorry, but... 

1443
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:36,580
因爲  她點燃了你的激情
Because, she lit up with you. 

1444
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,950
她從來沒有這樣對我
Just in a way that she never would with me, 

1445
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:45,110
這件事一直讓我很生氣  因爲...
and it used to make me so angry because... 

1446
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:50,230
我覺得你不配得到她  我可以這樣說嗎?
I didn't think that you deserved her. Can I say this? 

1447
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,030
是啊  繼續
Yeah, go on. 

1448
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:53,870
她讓你體面
She made you decent. 

1449
01:32:56,080 --> 01:33:01,550
然後爲了回報  你讓她非常高興
And then in return, you made her so happy. 

1450
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:03,070
太高興了
So happy. 

1451
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:09,550
爲此我一直很感激你的
And I will always be grateful to you for that. 

1452
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:18,260
就因爲這件事  我曾經跟她吵過架
And on that bombshell,  back to the sticks. 

1453
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:20,110
看看我的宿命  看他們
There's my lot out there. Oh! Look at them. 

1454
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:21,950
是啊  我知道
Yeah, I know. 

1455
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,830
好吧   保持聯繫  我會給你打個電話
So, listen, we'll stay in touch. I'll give you a call. 

1456
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:28,860
不  我不認爲這是必要的
No, I don't think that's necessary. 

1457
01:33:28,860 --> 01:33:30,670
我覺得我們以後不會再聯繫了
I think we're done here. 

1458
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,350
來這裏
Come here. 

1459
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:35,780
祝你好運  
Good luck, mate. All right? 

1460
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:37,180
你也一樣
You, too. 

1461
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:38,590
謝謝
Thank you. 

1462
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:47,350
你的到處都是蛋糕碎
You've got cake everywhere. 

1463
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:52,670
起來
Wake up. 

1464
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,270
起牀啦
Wake up. 

1465
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:04,470
好 不要驚慌  就我一個
It's all right. Don't panic. It's only me. 

1466
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:07,230

Emma  Emma Morley Emma. Emma Morley. 

1467
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,870
是的 你好
Yes. Hello. 

1468
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:12,270
你有什麼建議呢?
So what do you suggest we do? 

1469
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:16,310
我們可以保持聯繫
We could stay in touch. 

1470
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:19,430
今天  我們是註定要做一些東西的
Today. We're meant to be doing something today. 

1471
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:22,670
對  對   對
Right. Right, right. 

1472
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:26,870
你看  今天對我來說真的有點棘手
Look, today's a bit tricky for me, really. 

1473
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:29,470
不  不  不是  這只是...
No, no, it's not that. It's just... 

1474
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:30,860
好吧  我要去見我的父母  
Well, I'm meeting my parents, 

1475
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:31,670
然後我得回來...
and then I've got to get back... 

1476
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:34,510
哦  對的  你或許應該去
Oh, yeah, yeah, you should probably go then. 

1477
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:39,950
能遇見你真好 再見了 
It was lovely to meet you. Bye, now. 

1478
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:52,200
我遲點纔要去見他們  所以如果你想
Look, that's not until later, so if you wanted to, 

1479
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:56,360
我們可以去散步嗎?
we could go for a walk or something? 

1480
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:01,270
好啊
Okay. 

1481
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,870
來吧  跟上
Come on, keep up. 

1482
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:20,950
是這些鞋子的原因 我不能穿着這種鞋爬山
It's these shoes. I can't mountain climb in brogues. 

1483
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:22,170
這不是喬戈裏峯 
It's not K2. 

1484
01:35:22,170 --> 01:35:24,170
這只是一座大山  好吧?  
It's just a big hill, all right? 

1485
01:35:24,170 --> 01:35:25,310
小孩子都能爬上去
A child could do it. 

1486
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:34,150
我不希望你想起昨晚的任何事
I don't want you thinking I'm bothered or anything about last night. 

1487
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:36,410
我不希望要你的電話號碼 
I don't want your phone number, 

1488
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:38,230
或者信件 或者明信片
or letters, or postcards. 

1489
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:40,070
我不想跟你結婚
I don't want to get married to you. 

1490
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:42,540
也絕對不希望懷上你的孩子
Definitely don't want to have your babies. 

1491
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:45,470
不管明天發生什麼事  把握好今天
Whatever happens tomorrow, we've had today. 

1492
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:54,270
如果我們將來偶然相遇
And if we should bump into each other sometime in the future, 

1493
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:56,270
那也很好啊
well, that's fine, too. 

1494
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,310
我們會成爲朋友
We'll be friends. 

1495
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,390
是啊  
Yeah, right. 

1496
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:10,790
或者   另一方面...
Or, you know, on the other hand... 

1497
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:14,500
繼續
Go on. 

1498
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:19,190
好吧  我的父母暫時還不會回來
Well, my parents don't arrive until later. 

1499
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:22,230
所以?
So? 

1500
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:25,550
所以  我家裏沒有人了
So, well, the flat's empty. 

1501
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:30,510
如果你想完成我們之間未了的事
You know, if you wanted to finish what we started. 

1502
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:33,790
什麼? 內個?
What? Sober? 

1503
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,190
而且是在白天
And in daylight. 

1504
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:43,620
看誰快!
Race you! 

1505
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:01,990
你想要我揹你嗎 老頭?
Do you want a piggy-back, you old man? 

1506
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:06,070
這鞋子 在這裏根本走不動
It's these shoes. There's no blooming grip on these things. 

1507
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:07,950
這裏  來這裏
Here, come here, you. 

1508
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:13,710
你帶 Emma 來過這裏?
Did you come up here with Emma? 

1509
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:14,980
是的  一次
Yeah, once. 

1510
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:17,270
這是很久以前的事了
That was a long time ago now. 

1511
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,830
你想念她嗎?
Do you miss her? 

1512
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:21,350
嗯  我當然想念她
Well, of course, I do. 

1513
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:26,070
她... 她是我最好的的朋友
She was... She was my best friend. 

1514
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:28,190
現在誰是你最好的朋友呢?
Who's your best friend now then? 

1515
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,310
當然是你   來
Well, you are, of course. Come here. 

1516
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,150
那  誰是你最好的朋友?
Well, who's yours? 

1517
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:37,700
我認爲可能是媽媽
I think it's probably Mum. 

1518
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:42,660
是啊
Yeah. 

1519
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:46,710
我不是那麼吧可怕?
I'm not so terrible though, am I? 

1520
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,670
我纔不會回答你
I'm not answering that. 

1521
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:54,990
你知道你是什麼
You know what you are. 

1522
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:24,000
轉過這個彎就是了 這邊走
It's just round the corner. This way. 

1523
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:26,220

Dexter ! Oh, Dexter! 

1524
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,110
可惡  他們早到了
Damn it, they're early. 

1525
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:31,540
你們真早
You're early. 

1526
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:33,910
我們以爲我們會令你感到驚訝
We thought we'd surprise you. 

1527
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,670
顯然  得逞了
Clearly, we have. 

1528
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:40,180
媽媽  爸爸  這是 Emma Morley
Mum, Dad, this is Emma Morley. Morley. 

1529
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:41,590
你好  很高興見到你
Hello. Pleased to meet you. 

1530
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:43,790
Emma  你會和我們一起喝茶 是嗎?
Emma, you'll join us for tea, yes? 

1531
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:47,070
不  不  謝謝  我應該讓你去喝茶的
No, no, thanks. I should leave you to it. 

1532
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:49,670

1535
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,020
好了
Okay. 

1536
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:04,910
我很抱歉  我們剛剛打攪你了嗎?
I'm sorry. Did we just interrupt something? 

1537
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:08,870
沒有  Emma  只是我的好朋友
No, no. Emma's just a good friend. 

1538
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:11,630
昨天你不也穿着這件嗎?
Weren't you wearing this yesterday? 

1539
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:13,670
流氓
The rascal. 

1540
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:23,870
EM  等一下
Em, wait! Wait, wait. 

1541
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:28,510
我需要你的電話號碼

我對這一切感到很抱歉
Look, I'm so sorry about all of that. 

1544
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:37,220
我沒想見到他們直到我們... 你懂的
I wasn't expecting them until after we... Well, you know.

1552
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:55,870
