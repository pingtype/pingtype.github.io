1
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,050
我被卡住了!
I'm stuck!

2
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,360
退回去!
Get back!

3
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,510
敦蒂先生
Mr. Tweedy.

4
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,190
那只雞在圍欄外干什么?
What is that chicken doing outside the fence?

5
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,680
我不知道  親愛的
Oh! I don't know, love

6
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,210
馬上去處理一下!
Just deal with it. Now!

7
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,750
讓我難堪我要教訓你
I'll teach you to make a fool out of me

8
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,860
這對你們都是一個教訓!
Let that be a lesson to the lot of ya!

9
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,450
沒有雞能從敦蒂雞場逃出去!
No chicken escapes from Tweedy's farm!

10
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,690
早安  姜妹  剛度完假?
Morning, Ginger. Back from holiday?

11
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,480
我沒去度假  巴波斯
I wasn't on holiday, Babs.

12
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,930
我被關禁閉了
I was in solitary confinement

13
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,240
一個人獨呆一陣子也不錯
Oh, it's nice to get a bit of time to yourself

14
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,970
是不是?
isn't it?

15
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,330
集合!
Roll call!

16
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,440
馬上過來  你們列隊要晚了
Come along, now. You'll be late for parade

17
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,770
嘰嘰  嘰嘰  快點兒  左  右  左  右
Pip, pip. Quick march. Left, right, left, right

18
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,340
左  右  左  右!
Left, right, left, right!

19
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,340
快  精神點兒
Come on. Smarten up.

20
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,370
紀律! 秩序!
Discipline! Order!

21
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,350
想當初在皇家空軍
Back in my R.A.F. days

22
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,230
當長官命令緊急起飛
when the officer called for a scramble

23
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,480
你跳進老飛機  發現目標
you'd hop in the old crate and tally-ho.

24
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,460
轟隆開走了!
Chocks away!

25
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,510
別說了  老傻瓜
Give over, you old fool.

26
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,260
他們只想數數我們
They just want to count us

27
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,230
你怎么敢這樣對長官回話?
How dare you talk back to a senior ranking officer?

28
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,860
嘿  想當初在皇家空軍...
Why, back in my R.A.F. days!

29
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,200
福羅  他們來了
Fowler, they're coming

30
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,960
啊  好  好
Oh, right, right.

31
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,890
你要受到嚴厲的譴責
There will be a stern reprimand for you, lad.

32
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,530
取消你的自由活動
You're grounded

33
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,090
立正!
Attention!

34
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,190
歡迎你回來  母雞  有新的計劃嗎?
Welcome back, hen. Is there a new plan?

35
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:06,200
我想我們試過從下面出去
I thought we tried going under

36
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,860
噢  上面  好
Ah! Over. Right

37
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,030
雞蛋的數量怎么樣?
How's the egg count?

38
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,120
我今早下了五個  五個
I've laid five eggs this morning. Five!

39
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,490
那很好  我...很高興
Well-chuffed with that, I was!

40
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,960
產蛋記錄


41
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,000
啊  不  愛德文娜
Oh, no. Edwina

42
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,050
邦迪  你為什么不給她幾個?
Bunty, why didn't you give her some of yours?

43
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,550
我會的  可她沒說
I would have. She didn't tell me.

44
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,220
她沒對任何人說
She didn't tell anyone

45
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,960
噢  愛德文娜要去度假嗎?
Oh, is Edwina off on holiday?

46
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:01,150
我們必須逃離此地
We've got to get out of here

47
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,050
姜妹! 我們還要逃嗎?
Ginger! Are we still on?

48
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,750
啊  當然啦  我們要逃
Oh, we're on, all right

49
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,690
麥克  告訴大家  今晚在17號木屋開會
Spread the word, Mac. Meeting tonight in hut 17

50
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,150
你叫我們? 尼克...
You called? Nick and...

51
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,080
- 范晨  - 聽從你的吩咐
- Fetcher. - At your service

52
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,220
這邊兒來
Over here

53
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,180
我們還需要一些東西
We need some more things

54
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,700
好  小姐
Right you are, miss.

55
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,050
這套手工茶具怎么樣?
How about this quality handcrafted tea set?

56
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,110
不要
Uh, no

57
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,380
那來條漂亮的項鏈和掛墜?
Or a lovely necklace and pendant?

58
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,010
是不錯...
It's love...

59
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,880
或者這個美麗的帽子
Or this beautiful number

60
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,470
都是巴黎雞圈子里時髦的東西
all the rage in the fashionable chicken coops of Paree

61
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,640
這樣戴上
Simply pop it on like so

62
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,910
像法國雞那樣說聲"喔哇"
and as the French hens say, "Voila!"

63
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,210
那是法語
That's French

64
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,720
這是個兩用帽  小姐
That's two hats in one, miss.

65
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,910
參加晚會  參加婚禮
For parties, for weddings

66
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,080
啊  可是女士  這使你美極了
Oh, but madame, this makes you look like a vision

67
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,040
像夢中美人
like a dream

68
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,610
- 像只鴨子  - 不要  謝謝
- Like a duck. - No, thank you

69
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,500
我們在做這個  需要這些
We're making this. We need THESE things.

70
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,550
你能搞到嗎?
Can you get them?

71
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,380
啊  啊  這不容易  小姐
Oh, oh, oh, this is a big job, miss

72
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,070
啊  比其它的都難
Oh, bigger than the others.

73
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,810
不  不  價錢會很貴
No, no. This is gonna cost

74
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,850
價錢不變  一袋種子
Same as always. One bag of seed

75
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,640
- 這是你的付款? - 是雞飼料
- You call this pay? - It's chicken feed

76
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,510
- 我們還能給你什么? - 雞蛋
- What else could we give you? - Eggs

77
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,510
- 雞蛋? - 雞蛋
- Eggs? - Eggs

78
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,770
我們不能給你雞蛋  太珍貴了
We can't give you eggs. They're too valuable

79
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,540
我們也珍貴
And so are we

80
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,110
你先請  范晨
After you, Fetcher

81
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,410
我先請什么?
After I what?

82
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,210
走!
Move!

83
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,610
二十二加九
Twenty-two and nine

84
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,510
十四先令加三便士
Fourteen shillings and threepence

85
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,910
七加六便士乘三
Seven and sixpence times three

86
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,910
二加九
Two and nine

87
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:20,240
四個半便士
Fourpence ha'penny

88
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,900
蠢材  沒用的東西!
D-oh! Stupid, worthless creatures!

89
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,770
我做夠薄利生意了
I'm sick and tired of making minuscule profits

90
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,240
厭倦賺小錢的生意了


91
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,770
將你的雞場變成金礦


92
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,930
我發財了!


93
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,730
啊  對
Oh, yes

94
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,100
這些雞有什么詭計
Those chickens are up to something

95
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,970
安靜  我找到了一個方法
Quiet. I'm onto something

96
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,270
它們組織起來了  我知道
They're organized. I know it

97
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,740
- 我說  安靜  - 那個姜妹
- I said, quiet. - That ginger one

98
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,810
我認為她是頭兒
I reckon she's their leader

99
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,170
敦蒂先生!
Mr. Tweedy!

100
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,580
我想我最終找到了
I may finally have found a way to

101
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,810
生財之道
make us some real money here

102
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,800
而你卻在干什么?
and what are you on about?

103
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,800
愚蠢地在想雞會逃跑
Ridiculous notions of escaping chickens

104
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,500
但是... 但是...
But... But...

105
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:18,900
都是你想象的  敦蒂先生  你說
It's all in your head, Mr. Tweedy. Say it!

106
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,400
都是我想象的  都是我想象的
It's all in me head. It's all in me head

107
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,730
現在  你自己對自己重復
Now, you keep telling yourself that

108
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,570
因為我再也不想聽到它了
because I don't want to hear another word about it

109
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,870
- 清楚了嗎? - 清楚了  親愛的
- Is that clear? - Yes, love

110
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,900
但你知道那個姜妹...
But you know that ginger one...

111
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,830
它只是只雞  傻瓜!
It's chickens, you dolt!

112
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,070
除你之外
Apart from you

113
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,560
它們是地球上最蠢的動物
they're the most stupid creatures on this planet!

114
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,750
他們不會搞陰謀詭計
They don't plot, they don't scheme

115
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,600
他們沒有組織
and they are not organized

116
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,960
秩序! 秩序!
Order! Order!

117
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:53,200
大家安靜  安定
Quiet, everyone. Settle down.

118
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,290
我請你們注意秩序...
I would like to call to order!Please

119
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,100
如果你們能夠...
if you could just...

120
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,690
大家有點兒紀律! 什么  什么!
Let's have some discipline in the ranks! What, what!

121
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,030
- 謝謝  福羅  - 當年我在皇家空軍
- Thank you, Fowler. - In my R.A.F. day

122
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,570
我們從不允許
we were never allowed to waste time

123
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,000
閑聊浪費時間
with unnecessary chit-chat

124
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,190
是  謝謝你  福羅
Yes, thank you, Fowler

125
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,960
我...
I...

126
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,660
對!
Right!

127
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,370
繼續吧
Carry on

128
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,110
我知道上次的逃跑行動
Now, I know our last escape attempt was

129
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,390
有點兒失敗
a bit of a fiasco

130
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,490
但麥克和我又有了新計劃
but Mac and I have come up with a brand-new plan

131
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,160
- 給他們看看  麥克  - 好
- Show 'em, Mac. - Right

132
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,000
我們試著從鐵絲網下出去  但沒有成功
We tried going under the wire and that didn't work

133
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,330
因此這個計劃是...從上面過
So, the plan is...we go OVER it

134
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,120
這是我們  明白嗎?
This is us, right?

135
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,430
我們這樣進去
We get in like this

136
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,730
把它拉緊...松手!
Wind her up and...let her go!

137
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,690
天啊  這個蘿卜完蛋了!
Good grief! The turnip's bought it!

138
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:00,190
農夫來了!
Farmer's coming!

139
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,460
隱蔽行動!
Operation Cover-up!

140
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,450
敦蒂先生!
 Mr. Tweedy!

141
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,550
- 你在哪兒? - 都是你想象的
- Where are you? - Ooh. It's all in your head

142
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,790
都是你想象的  都是你想象的
It's all in your head. It's all in your head

143
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,520
各位想想  我們還有什么沒有試過?
Think, everyone, think. What haven't we tried yet?

144
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,990
我們還沒試過不逃跑
We haven't tried NOT trying to escape

145
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,990
嗯  那可能行得通
Hmm. That might work

146
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,720
記得愛德文娜?
What about Edwina?

147
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:02,620
還得有多少空窩才行?
How many more empty nests will it take?

148
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,550
也許如果她花更多的時間下蛋
Perhaps it wouldn't be empty

149
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,080
而不是逃跑
if she'd spent more time laying

150
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,790
她的窩就不會空
and less time escaping

151
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,860
所以你一生都在下蛋...
So laying eggs all your life...

152
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,520
然后被拔毛  填料  烘烤
and then getting plucked, stuffed

153
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,360
這樣夠好了吧?
and roasted is good enough?

154
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,650
這是命運
It's a living

155
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,450
你們知道問題在哪兒嗎?
You know what the problem is?

156
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,960
圍欄不僅僅將農場圍住
The fences aren't just round the farm.

157
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,120
也將你們的思想圍住了
They're up here in your heads

158
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,680
那里有個更好的地方
There's a better place out there

159
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,380
就在山丘那邊兒
somewhere beyond that hill

160
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:31,390
那里空間開闊  樹木眾多...
and it has wide open spaces and lots of trees...

161
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,460
還有草原
and grass

162
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,220
你能想象出嗎? 翠綠的草原
Can you imagine that? Cool, green grass

163
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,720
- 誰來喂我們? - 我們自力更生
- Who feeds us? - We feed ourselves

164
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,950
- 那  農場在哪兒? - 沒有農場
- Well, where's the farm? - There is no farm

165
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,830
那農夫住在哪兒
Then where does the farmer live?

166
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,610
沒有農夫  巴波斯
There is no farmer, Babs

167
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,190
- 他去度假了嗎? - 他哪兒也沒去
- Is he on holiday? - He isn't anywhere

168
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,780
你還不明白嗎?
Don't you get it?

169
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,920
沒有早點名  沒有農夫
There's no morning head count, no farmers

170
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,580
沒有狗  雞舍和鑰匙
no dogs, coops and keys

171
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,710
也沒有圍欄
and no fences

172
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:03,720
我一生中從沒有聽過  如此精彩的...
In all my life I've never heard such a fantastic...

173
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,480
一堆廢話!
load of tripe!

174
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,180
哎  面對現實吧  親愛的
Oh, face the facts, ducks

175
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,270
從這兒出去的機率
The chances of us getting out of here

176
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,810
只有百萬分之一
are a million to one

177
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,350
那我們仍有機會
Then there's still a chance

178
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,840
啊  不  啊  不  我在干什么?
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no. What am I doing?

179
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,440
你想騙誰?
Who are you trying to fool?

180
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,410
你不能誘騙這群...
You can't lead this bunch of...

181
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,650
啊  老天幫幫我們
Oh, heaven help us

182
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,570
自由!
Freedoooom!

183
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,810
女士們先生們  謝謝你們
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen

184
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,940
你們是極好的觀眾
You've been a wonderful audience

185
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:29,910
噢  好的
Oh, yes

186
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,600
有辦法了!
That's it!

187
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,340
快把他搬進去
Get him inside quickly

188
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,170
這是我們出去的辦法
THIS is our way out of here

189
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,040
我們做海報?
We'll make posters?

190
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,670
不  是海報上的畫兒  巴波斯
No. What's ON the poster, Babs. What's ON the poster

191
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,300
我們將飛出去!
We'll fly out!

192
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,100
有他的照片  一定是個人物
He must be important to have his picture taken.

193
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,430
他是干什么的?
What does he do?

194
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,600
這還不明顯嗎? 他是職業飛行公雞
Isn't it obvious? He's a professional flying rooster

195
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,110
他在農場間做示范飛行
He flies from farm to farm, giving demonstrations

196
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,840
- 你這樣認為? - 啊  當然
- Do you suppose? - Oh, absolutely

197
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,170
不能在暗處  不  不能在這兒
Not in the dark, no. No, not in there. No

198
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,830
出去  好  要拿...
Get out. Good. Gotta get...

199
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,800
你們是誰? 我在哪兒? 發生了什么事?
Who are you? Where am I? What's going on?

200
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,270
哎呀! 我的翅膀怎么了?
Ouch! What happened to my wing?

201
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,270
你剛才跌得很慘
You took a rather nasty fall

202
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,200
你扭傷了前腱
And sprained the anterior tendon

203
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,760
我給你捏了捏  包扎了一下兒
I gave it a wee bit of a tweak and wrapped her up

204
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,120
這是英語嗎?
Was that English?

205
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,000
你扭傷了翅膀  她弄好了
You sprained a wing. She fixed it

206
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,900
- 是我做的繃帶  - 是我抱你進來的
- I made the bandage. - I-I carried you in

207
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,170
我們從頭開始說  我在哪兒?
Let's back up and start from the top. Where am I?

208
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:56,210
你說得對  真沒禮貌  我們只是太激動了...
You're right. How rude. We're just very excit...

209
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,200
這是個養雞場
This is a chicken farm

210
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,290
我們都是雞
And we're the chickens

211
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,100
哦  現在明白了  雞場  雞...
Yeah, with you so far. Chicken farm, chickens...

212
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,020
我不喜歡他的樣子
I don't like the look of this one.

213
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,830
他兩眼的距離太近了
His eyes are too close together

214
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,670
- 福羅  別這樣  - 他還是個美國佬!
- Fowler, please. - And he's a Yank!

215
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,260
別急  老大爺  在我們那兒斗雞是違法的
Easy, Pops. Cockfighting's illegal where I come from

216
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,300
那究竟是什么地方??
And where is that exactly?

217
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,220
一個我稱之為自由之地
A place I call the land of the free

218
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,370
勇敢之家的地方
and the home of the brave

219
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:20,460
- 蘇格蘭! - 不  美國
- Scotland! - No! America

220
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,090
美國
Oh! America

221
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,350
胡扯  愛管閑事的美國人
Poppycock. Pushy Americans.

222
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,530
每次打仗總是晚出場
Showing up late for every war

223
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,130
掙得多  愛得多  來這兒了!
Overpaid, oversexed and over here!

224
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,000
老爺爺怎么啦?
What's eating Grandpa?

225
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,530
哦  別在意  這位先生...
Oh, don't mind him, Mister!Mister?

226
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,260
我叫洛基·羅德  紅島的洛基  簡稱羅德
Name's Rocky. Rocky the Rhode Island Red. Rhodes for short

227
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:44,960
- 洛基·羅德? - 很順耳  是吧?
- Rocky Rhodes? - Catchy, ain't it?

228
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,000
羅德先生  這是你嗎?
Um, Mr. Rhodes, is this you?

229
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,830
誰想知道?
Uh, who wants to know?

230
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,090
一群十分絕望的雞
A group of rather desperate chickens

231
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,860
你看  如果是你
You see, if it is you

232
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:59,300
那你可能就是我們祈禱的答案
then you just might be the answer to our prayers

233
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:06,190
那么就叫我奇跡吧  娃娃臉  因為那就是我
Well, then, call me a miracle, dollface, 'cause that's me

234
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,320
你怎么來英國了  羅德先生?
And what brings you to England, Mr. Rhodes?

235
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:13,760
那當然是因為英國的美女了
Why, all the beautiful English chicks, of course

236
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,890
別逗了!
Give over!

237
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,330
你看  我天生喜歡旅行
You see, I'm a traveler by nature

238
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,630
我在農舍呆過
I've done the whole barnyard thing

239
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,490
但我很不適應
but I couldn't get into it

240
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:26,620
嗨  你好? 諾鋪
Hi. How are you? Nope

241
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,750
自由自在  這才是我的方式
The open road. That's more my style

242
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,710
對  給我個背包
Yep, just give me a pack on my back

243
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,130
告訴我方向
and point me where the wind blows

244
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,200
實際上  你知道在我家鄉  他們叫我什么嗎?
In fact, you know what they call me back home?

245
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,200
你們會喜歡的  孤獨的自由浪人
You're gonna love this. The Lone Free Ranger

246
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,130
很偉大吧?
Isn't that great?

247
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,720
- 我知道有可能  - 有可能  對
- I knew it was possible. - Oh, it's possible, all right

248
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,730
- 我知道會有辦法的  - 阿們!
- I knew the answer would come. - Amen!

249
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,920
我們都將飛過那個圍欄
We're all going to fly over that fence

250
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,590
羅德先生給我們示范  對吧?
and Mr. Rhodes is going to show us how, right?

251
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:56,990
那... 什么? 你說"飛"?
That's... What? Did you say "fly"?

252
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,960
- 你可以教我們  - 不  我不能
- You can teach us. - No, I can't

253
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,890
聽著  噓  你們聽到了嗎?
Listen. Shh. You hear that?

254
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,930
那是自由大道在叫我
That's the open road calling my name

255
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,090
我生來就對此有反應
and I was born to answer that call

256
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,190
他的聽力一定很好
He must have very good hearing

257
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,650
是  是  出口在哪兒? 啊  在這兒
Okay, okay, where's the exit? Ah, this way

258
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,350
羅德先生  也許
Mr. Rhodes, um, perhaps

259
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,920
我沒有  把我們的處境講清楚
I didn't explain our situation properly

260
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,390
我們一天到晚下蛋
We lay eggs day in and day out

261
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:24,890
當我們再也不能下蛋時  他們就殺了我們
and when we can't lay any more, they kill us

262
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,720
這是個殘酷的世界  娃娃臉
It's a cruel world, doll face.

263
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,250
你或許應該適應它
You might as well get used to it

264
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,660
"他們要殺我們" 你都明白了嗎?
Which part of "they kill us" do you not understand?

265
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,780
我也有自己煩惱的事
I got my own set of problems to worry about

266
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,080
此外  從這個鳥籠子出去  也并不太難
Besides, this birdcage can't be that hard to bust out of

267
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,620
實際上  瞧著我
In fact, watch me

268
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,450
一只  甚至兩只雞
It's not so hard to get one chicken

269
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,160
出去并不難
out of here or even two

270
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,780
但我們全要出去
but this is about all of us

271
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,790
全部出去?
All of you?

272
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,620
這就是我一直想告訴你的
That's what I've been trying to tell you

273
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,620
等等  讓我搞清楚
Wait a minute. Let me get this straight

274
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,520
你想讓所有的雞
You want to get every chicken

275
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,320
同時從這兒逃出?
in this place out of here at the SAME TIME?

276
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,750
- 當然  - 你瘋了!
- Of course. - You're certifiable!

277
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,670
你不能做這種驚險的事
You can't pull off a stunt like that.

278
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,320
這是自殺
That's suicide

279
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,890
有志者事竟成
Where there's a will, there's a way

280
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,480
完全同意  我要從那兒走了
Couldn't agree more. I WILL be leaving that way

281
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,520
- 但... 請別走! - 我就是這種人...
- But... Please! -  I'm the type of guy

282
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:14,080
我喜歡自由  我從來沒有在一個地方...
That likes to roam around I'm never in one...

283
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,950
原來如此  你是馬戲團的
So that's it. You're from the circus

284
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,580
你是逃出來的  是不是?
You're on the run, aren't you?

285
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,010
你能不能小聲點兒?
You wanna keep it down?

286
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,590
我正在躲藏
I'm trying to lay low here.

287
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,710
我應當馬上宣揚出去
I should turn you in right now

288
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,890
你不會的  對吧?
You wouldn't. Would you?

289
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,620
給我個不會的理由
Give me one reason why I shouldn't

290
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,810
因為我很...可愛?
Because I'm...cute?

291
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,710
嗨  嗨! 你是哪種瘋雞?
Hey, hey, hey! What kind of crazy chick are you?

292
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,080
你知道我被找到下場會咋樣?
Do you know what'll happen if he finds me?

293
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:03,980
這是個殘酷的世界
It's a cruel world

294
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,020
我剛剛決定  我不喜歡你
I just decided. I don't like you

295
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,370
我剛剛決定我不在乎
I just decided. I don't care.

296
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,740
現在  給我們示范飛行
Now, show us how to fly

297
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,480
- 用這只翅膀? - 那就教我們吧
- With this wing? - Teach us, then

298
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,980
不!
No!

299
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,720
他很有價值  你剛才說?
He's valuable, you say?

300
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,940
- 當然  - 拿電筒來
- Sure. - Get the torch

301
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,530
現在聽著  姊妹
Now, you listen here, sister.

302
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,350
我再也不想過那種生活了
I'm not going back to that life

303
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:25,110
我是個孤獨的自由浪人  喜歡自由
I'm a Lone Free Ranger. Emphasis on FREE!

304
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,010
那也是我們的追求  自由!
And that's what we want. Freedom!

305
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,010
喜歡自由  他們向這里走來了
Fancy that. They're coming this way

306
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,410
啊  不  他們是來抓我的
Oh, oh, no. No. They're on to me

307
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,570
教我們飛行我們就把你藏起來
Teach us to fly and we'll hide you

308
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,200
如果我不呢?
And if I don't?

309
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,070
你爸爸也是這么卑鄙嗎?
Was your father by any chance a vulture?

310
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,110
我們成交了嗎?
Do we have a deal?

311
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,640
是實行交易的時候了  娃娃...
Time to make good on that deal, doll...

312
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,580
我叫姜妹
The name is Ginger

313
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,940
- 舒服嗎? - 不太舒服
- Comfortable? - Not really

314
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,270
這也許會有所幫助
Maybe this will help

315
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,970
藏窩不錯
Nice hideout

316
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,340
哎喲  比蛋殼還小
Ouch. I had more room in my egg

317
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,380
我們履行了我們的諾言
We've held up our end of the deal.

318
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,970
明天你得履行你的了
Tomorrow you hold up yours

319
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,980
- 什么諾言? - 飛行!
- What deal? - The flying!

320
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,100
噢  對  對  別擔心
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right, right, right. Don't worry

321
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,210
我將傾囊相授
I'll teach you everything I know

322
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:50,240
現在  我的床在哪兒?
Now, which bunk is mine?

323
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,470
真是太氣人了!
Absolutely outrageous!

324
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,470
讓一個長官和別人睡一張床...
Asking a senior officer to share his quarters...

325
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,370
和一個美國小兵  太過分了
and with a noncommissioned Yank, no less

326
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,800
想當初  我從...
Why, back in my day, I'd never!

327
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:08,340
你也不是我的首選
You weren't exactly my first choice, either

328
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,770
挪開點兒  你的翅膀到我這邊兒了
And scoot over. Your wing's on my side of the bunk

329
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,670
你那邊兒?
Your side of the bunk?

330
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,330
整張床都是我的
The WHOLE bunk is my side of the bunk!

331
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:20,000
等等... 什么味道? 是你的口臭?
Just... What's that smell? Is that your breath?

332
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,000
真是太氣人了!
It's absolutely outrageous

333
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:32,210
因此你們想飛行  嗯?
So you wanna fly, huh?

334
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,220
好  這并不容易
Well, it ain't gonna be easy

335
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,140
一朝一夕是學不會的
and it ain't gonna happen overnight

336
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,210
你知道  飛行得有三樣東西
You see, flying takes three things

337
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:42,330
努力練習  不屈不撓...
Hard work, perseverance and...

338
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,500
- 努力練習  - 你說兩次努力練習了!
- Hard work. - You said hard work twice!

339
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,070
那是因為
That's because

340
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,370
它比不屈不撓難兩倍
it takes twice as much work as perseverance

341
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:53,960
一派胡言!
Codswallop!

342
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,640
現在  最重要的是
Now, the most important thing is

343
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,760
我們要共同合作
we have to work as a team

344
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,960
這意味著... 我說什么你們就做什么
which means... you do everything I tell you

345
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,730
好! 我們開始吧!
Right! Let's rock and roll!

346
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:54,060
敦蒂先生! 雞都在...
Mrs. Tweedy! The chickens are...

347
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,720
吃食?
Pecking?

348
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:01,590
左  二  三  右  二  三
And left, two, three. And right, two, three

349
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:05,820
嗯...停下  啊  對  往下
And...stop right there. Oh, yeah, down

350
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:09,520
往下  對  轉小圈  就這樣  快點兒
Down. Yeah, make little circles. That's it. Faster

351
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,620
快點兒  對  好極了
Faster. Oh, yes. Perfect

352
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,720
噢  就是這兒
Oh, that's the spot.

353
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,760
我以為你要教我們飛呢
I thought you were going to teach us how to fly

354
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,360
我正在教啊
That's what I'm doing

355
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,460
不是該有些拍翅膀的動作嗎?
Isn't there usually some flapping involved?

356
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,890
嘿  我告訴你怎么下蛋了嗎?
Hey, do I tell YOU how to lay eggs?

357
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,430
放心  我們正在進步
Relax. We're making progress

358
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:47,820
真的? 我總覺得我們在兜圈子
Really? I can't help feeling we're going around in circles

359
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:51,920
這... 嘿! 停下! 你們讓我頭暈
What the... Hey! Cut it out! You're making me dizzy

360
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:54,650
我想他們準備好飛行了
I think they're ready to fly now

361
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,750
好  因為他們再也走不動了
Good, because they certainly can't walk anymore

362
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,550
過來  姑娘  我們拍翅膀
Up and at 'em, gals. Let's flap

363
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,960
瞧  范晨
Watch, Fetcher

364
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,890
我們看看老母雞  是否改變了主意
Let's see if old Attila the Hen has come to her senses

365
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,950
下起雞雨了!
It's raining hen!

366
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,580
- 這是什么把戲  親愛的? - 我們在飛
- What's this caper, love? - We're flying

367
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,590
當然
Obviously

368
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:34,250
拍翅膀  看這兒  范晨
Flipping hell. Look at this, Fetch

369
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,520
他們找死啊
They're gonna kill themselves

370
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:39,420
- 想看下去? - 想  看吧
- Wanna watch? - Yeah, all right

371
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,820
嗨! 小心那些雞蛋!
Hey! Careful of those eggs!

372
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,580
單煎一面
 Sunny-side up.

373
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,080
現在他們很容易翻過來!
Now they're over easy!

374
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,680
無疑成了炒蛋
 Definitely scrambled

375
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,550
走! 走! 走!
Go! Go! Go!

376
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:15,420
走  走  走!
Go, go, go, go! Go!

377
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:18,080
雞在行動!
Poultry in motion!

378
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,450
物以類聚  人以群分
Birds of a feather flop together

379
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,280
干得好  女士們  干得好!
Great work, ladies. Great work!

380
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,750
受點兒苦對你們不錯  是好事
The pain you're feeling is a good thing. It's good

381
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,820
痛苦是你們的朋友  對吧? 這是好事
Pain is your friend, okay? It's a positive thing

382
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,990
堅定信念... 你叫什么名字?
Just keep the faith, uh... What's your name?

383
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,370
安吉絲! 你會成功的
Agnes! You'll get there

384
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,450
小鴨  我想你今天  飛過四英尺了!
Ducky, I think you flew four feet today!

385
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:57,710
對  四英尺! 從屋頂到地面
Right, four feet! From the roof to the ground

386
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,150
女士們  別擔心
It's all part of the process, ladies.

387
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,480
這是成功的必由之路
Nothing to worry about!

388
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,550
你這個吃奶酪的小...
Ya cheese-eating little...

389
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:08,380
這聽起來不太好
That doesn't sound good. Ha, ha, ha

390
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,140
聽  大地在震動  我們需要擔心嗎?
Okay, the ground's shaking. Are we worried?

391
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,580
我們需要擔心嗎?
Are we worried?

392
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:23,140
馬戲團  快  把我藏起來
The circus. Quick. Hide me

393
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,270
- 藏起來  - 來
- Hide me. - Come on

394
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,390
像瘋雞一樣亂拍翅膀
One isn't awarded a medal

395
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,470
是得不到獎章的
like this for flapping about like a lunatic

396
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,770
你看  這兒  這是長官的地方
Now, see here! This is an officer's quarters

397
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,020
快  到這兒來
Quick. In here.

398
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,280
馬上出去  先生!
Get out of here immediately, sir!

399
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,570
夠了  老爺爺
Give it a rest, Pops

400
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,480
出去! 本周我不會饒了你
Out of here! I shall have you on a charge within the week

401
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,440
家禽產品有限公司


402
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,730
謝謝  伙計
Cheers, mate

403
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,910
都是你想象的  都是你想象的
It's all in your head. It's all in your head

404
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,000
都是你想象的
It's all in your head

405
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:43,900
什么... 什么... 這些是什么?
What... What... What's all this, then?

406
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:46,270
這是我們的未來  敦蒂先生
This is our future, Mr. Tweedy

407
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:48,490
再也不用浪費時間
No more wasting time with petty

408
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,600
收集雞蛋和算小賬了
egg collection and minuscule profits

409
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:54,700
不收集蛋了? 可我們一直是雞農
No more eggs? But we've always been egg farmers

410
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,610
我父親的父親的父親
Me father and his father and all their fathers.

411
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:57,900
他們都是...
They was always...

412
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,800
窮光蛋! 一文不值
Poor! Worthless. Nothings

413
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,800
但這一切都要改變了
But all that's about to change

414
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:07,270
這將使敦蒂雞場  走出黑暗的年代...
This will take Tweedy's farm out of the dark ages...

415
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:11,070
進入大規模的自動化生產
and into full-scale automated production

416
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:16,040
我再也不是窮光蛋了
Melisha Tweedy will be poor no longer

417
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,890
操作指南


418
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,960
那我把它安裝起來  好嗎?
I'll put it together, then, shall I?

419
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,860
這不太妙  麥克
This isn't good, Mac

420
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:32,670
盒子里的東西是給我們的
Whatever's in those boxes is for us

421
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,030
我想不是軟草
and I don't think it's softer hay

422
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,640
啊  母雞  我討厭說喪氣話
Aye, hen. And I hate to be the voice of doom

423
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,690
但我一直在思考
but I've been calculating

424
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,140
我們生來就不適合飛行
and I just don't think we're built for flying

425
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,830
但我看到他飛過鐵絲網
But I saw him. He flew in over that fence

426
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,200
啊  啊  我相信你
Aye, aye, I believe you

427
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,270
但如果我們能親眼看看
but if we could just see it for ourselves

428
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,300
那就能說明問題了
that may answer some questions

429
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,630
你說得對  對不起
You're right. I'm sorry

430
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,130
我們練了一個周  可一點兒進展都沒有
We've been at this all week, and we're getting nowhere

431
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:59,570
如果他的翅膀好點兒  他就...
If his wing were better, he could!

432
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,570
啊! 我去跟他說說
Oh! I'll have a word with him

433
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,230
他在哪兒?
Where is he?

434
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:13,230
他們給我獎章  不是因為我是美國保姆
They didn't give me this medal for being a Yank nanny

435
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:15,630
一句簡單的 "我不知道" 就足夠了
A simple "I don't know" would suffice

436
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:19,530
當心那位  小姜妹
Beware of that one, young Ginger

437
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:22,100
那個美國佬不可信任
That Yank is not to be trusted

438
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,130
他是我們離開這兒的希望
That YANK is our ticket out of here

439
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,710
豬對馬說
And the pig says to the horse

440
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:30,460
"嗨  伙計  為什么臉拉這么長?"
"Hey, fella, why the long face?"

441
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,360
噢  瞧  瞧
Oh, oh, look, look

442
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,730
啊  雞尾酒!
Oh. Cocktail!

443
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,350
別逗了!
Give over!

444
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,520
好吧... 無論如何...
So, um, anyway...

445
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,440
明天要記住飛行事項
Remember those flying tips tomorrow.

446
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,560
這很重要
They're very important

447
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,530
一直保持想飛的念頭
Keep thinking those flighty thoughts

448
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,860
噢  好
Oh, yeah

449
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,860
他們是一流的雞  真的是
They're swell chicks. They really are

450
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,930
瞧巴波斯給我織了什么
Look at what Babs made me

451
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,890
一個口罩  很可愛吧?
A beak warmer. Isn't that the cutest?

452
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,690
那個邦迪  她真有勁
And that Bunty. She really packs a punch

453
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,190
有什么問題嗎?
Is there a problem here?

454
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,350
- 我們飛過圍欄了嗎? - 還沒有
- Have we flown over that fence? - Not quite

455
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,960
那就有問題了
Then there's a problem

456
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,790
耐心等待才能成功  娃娃臉
Good things come to those who wait, dollface

457
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,790
姜妹!
Ginger!

458
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,980
- 好  你花了多長時間? - 做什么?
- Okay, how long did it take you? - To do what?

459
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:33,030
學習飛行啊
To learn how to fly

460
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,560
蘋果和橘子  洋娃娃
Apples and oranges, baby doll.

461
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,990
我有天賦  他們卻沒有
I'm gifted. They're not

462
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:38,680
兩者不能比較  對吧?
You can't compare the two, okay?

463
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,880
問題是  這些事情要花時間
The point is, these things take time

464
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,510
而我們很快就沒有時間了
Which we are rapidly running out of

465
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:45,060
我們甚至還沒離開地面
We haven't even lifted off the ground. Why?

466
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,220
信心  我反復想過
Trust. I went over my calculations

467
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,720
我認為關鍵的因素是信心
and I figured the key element was trust

468
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,020
我一點兒也不明白
I-I didn't get a word of that

469
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,220
當鴨子和鵝飛行時
When birds like ducks and geese take off

470
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,560
他們有什么呢? 信心!
what do they have? Trust!

471
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,420
我發誓她用錯了詞
I swear she ain't using real words

472
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,460
- 她說我們需要更多的動力  - 哦  動力
- She said we need more thrust. - Oh, thrust

473
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,060
當然  我們需要動力
Well, of course, we need thrust.

474
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,790
動力和飛行像...這個!
Thrust and flying are like...this!

475
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:14,690
- 希望你不介意? - 當然
- Would you excuse us? - Aye

476
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:17,090
啊  翅膀  翅膀  翅膀
Ah, the wing, the wing, the wing

477
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,810
如果明天我們還看不到結果  交易就取消了
If we don't see some results by tomorrow, the deal is off

478
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,460
沒有掩護了  他們會找到你
No more hiding. They will find you

479
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,620
你回馬戲團去吧  飛人!
and it's back to the circus, flyboy!

480
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,950
我從沒遇到像你這樣難交的雞
You're the first chick I ever met with the shell still on

481
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:33,350
睡個好覺  天使臉
Sleep tight, angel face. The Rock's on the case

482
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:47,210
喔...喔! 什么  什么
Cock-a-doodle-doo! What, what

483
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,850
啊  很漂亮  朋友
 Oh, it was a beaut, guv'nor

484
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,950
如果讓我說  一件藝術精品
A fine piece of work, if I do say so meself

485
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,350
- 我也對自己說  - 希望我也見過
- I say so meself, too. - Wish I could have seen it

486
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:00,890
我們溜進了農夫的家里  悄悄地
We slipped into the farmer's room, all quiet like

487
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,080
- 像條魚  - 對  我們...
- Like a fish. - Yeah, and we...

488
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:08,550
"像條魚"? 你這個笨蛋
"Like a fish"? You stupid Norbert

489
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,740
不管咋樣  這給你  朋友
Anyway, guv, here it is

490
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:13,680
- 你要的貨  - 這是西班牙語
- El merchandiso. - That's Spanish

491
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,270
這倆個無賴在這兒干什么?
What are these two crooks doing here?

492
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:20,110
- 那你們認識? - 她認為我們沒用
- So, you know each other? - She don't think we're valuable

493
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,810
伙計  毫無疑問  你們是最鬼鬼祟祟的
Guys, you are without a doubt the sneakiest

494
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,510
我所見過的最靈巧的竊賊
most light-fingered thieving parasites I've ever met

495
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:29,850
- 啊  別  別說了  - 我的臉都紅
- Oh, don't, don't. Stop it. - I've gone bright red

496
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,850
那...那些雞蛋呢?
So, uh, how about them eggs?

497
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:34,110
雞蛋  別告訴我你答應他們...
Eggs? Don't tell me you promised them...

498
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,740
對! 答應給他們  這個月我生的所有的蛋
Yep! Promised them every egg I lay this month

499
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:40,080
我們什么時候  可以拿到第一個蛋呢?
And when can we expect the first installment?

500
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,440
我正在準備呢  我會通知你的
I'm brewing one up as we speak. I'll keep you posted

501
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,600
很高興與你做生意  先生
Pleasure doing business with you, sir

502
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,610
傻瓜
Sucker

503
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,670
- 什么? - 你對他們撒謊
- What? - You've lied to them

504
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:57,840
我沒有  娃娃臉  我只是隱瞞了一些事實
I didn't lie, dollface. I just...omitted certain truths

505
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,880
我會履行諾言的
I'll give them exactly what I promised

506
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,260
那就是什么都沒有
Which is nothing.

507
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,540
那就是我要給他們的
Which is what I'll give them

508
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,700
你會給我們什么?
And what will you give us?

509
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,510
動力!
Thrrrust!

510
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:12,540
你沒事兒吧  寶貝兒? 好
You okay, sweetheart? Good, good

511
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,840
這會對你有點兒幫助
Now this is just a little helper

512
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,840
幫助你飛行的東西  動力訓練
Something to get you going. It's a thrust exercise

513
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:22,610
- 我緊張死了  - 這會害死她!
- The tension's killing me. - It's gonna kill her!

514
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:25,010
松手!
- Release! - Whoa!

515
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,740
快  拍翅膀!
Come on! Flap!

516
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:38,000
你能行  拍  拍  拍!
You can do it. Flap, flap, flap!

517
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,870
對  對  對!
Yes, yes, yes!

518
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,840
這是你第一次碰壁嗎?
Is that your first offense?

519
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:09,070
點名了! 我還沒下蛋呢
Roll call! I haven't laid any eggs

520
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:11,370
- 藏起我  - 三天沒下一個蛋
- Hide me. - Three days and not one

521
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,600
- 啊  不! - 為啥不告訴我們  巴波斯?
- Oh, no! - Why didn't you tell us, Babs?

522
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,870
- 把我藏起來! - 我們一直忙著飛行...
- Hide me! - We've been busy with the flying...

523
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,700
- 他們來了! - 快藏起我!
- They're coming! - Hide me!

524
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:20,430
自己藏吧!
Hide yourself!

525
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,600
給他們雙倍飼料  敦蒂先生
Double their food rations, Mr. Tweedy

526
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:26,930
我要他們都像這只這么肥
I want them all as fat as this one

527
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,730
我的一生都在我眼前閃過!
All of me life flashed before me eyes!

528
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,860
無聊的一生
It was really boring

529
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,990
雞飼料  我最喜歡的!
Chicken feed. My favorite!

530
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,830
等等!
Wait. Wait

531
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:54,230
不  等等!
No. Wait!

532
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,690
巴波斯  邦迪! 停下! 等等!
Babs, please! Bunty! Stop it! Wait!

533
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,000
停下!
Stop!

534
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:11,520
停下!
Stop it!

535
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:17,600
有點兒不大對勁兒  你們看不出來?
Something is wrong here. Can't you see that?

536
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,130
倉庫里來了許多奇怪的盒子  巴波斯不下蛋了
Strange boxes arrive in the barn. Babs stops laying

537
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,760
可她并沒被抓去宰了
but she's not taken to the chop

538
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,160
他們還給我們加飼料
and now they're giving us extra food

539
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:27,630
你們不明白發生了什么事? 他們在養肥我們
Don't you see what's happening? They're fattening us up

540
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:30,560
他們要把我們全部殺掉
They're going to kill us all

541
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:35,620
哇  哇  嚴重警告
Whoa, whoa! Heavy alert.

542
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:37,290
她不是那個意思  姑娘們
She didn't mean that, gals.

543
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:38,130
你不介意吧?
Do you mind?

544
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,390
接著吃  給我留點兒
Keep eating. Save some for me

545
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,720
你在干什么? 你怎么敢... 放開我!
What are you doing? How dare you! Let go of me!

546
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:47,020
聽著  我遇到了不少難煮的蛋
Listen! I've met some hard-boiled eggs in my day

547
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:49,030
但我說你得煮大約20分鐘!
but I'd say you're about 20 minutes!

548
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:50,710
你這是什么意思?
What's that supposed to mean?

549
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:52,150
我說你該輕松點兒
It means you got to lighten up

550
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:54,230
在美國  我們的規矩是
Over in America, we have this rule

551
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:57,120
如果你要激勵某人  不要提到死
If you want to motivate someone, don't mention death

552
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:01,020
有趣  這里的規矩是: 永遠要講實話
Funny. Over here, the rule is: Always tell the truth

553
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:03,820
這一直很有效  不是嗎?
That's been working like a real charm, hasn't it?

554
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:07,150
這里有些免費的建議  你要試試嗎?
Here's some free advice. You want them to perform?

555
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:10,060
- 說他們想聽的話  - 你是說要撒謊
- Tell them what they want to hear. - You mean lie

556
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,750
我們又轉回來了  你知道你的問題在哪兒嗎?
Here we go again. You know what your problem is?

557
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,850
你...難處
You're...difficult

558
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,470
為什么? 因為我誠實?
Why? Because I'm honest?

559
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,150
我關心他們的命運
I care about what happens to them

560
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,360
我不期待
something I wouldn't expect

561
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,550
孤獨的自由浪人會理解
a Lone Free Ranger to know anything about

562
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,690
如果你這樣說
If this is the way you show it

563
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:26,320
我希望你永遠別關心我!
I hope you never care about me!

564
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,250
- 我可以保證  不再會了  - 好!
- I can assure you, I never will. - Good!

565
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,580
好!
Fine!

566
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,320
發生了什么事?
What's all this?

567
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:24,580
哦  她在這兒  問她就知道了
Well, here she is. Ask and you shall receive

568
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:26,280
言之有理
That's biblical

569
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:28,990
這是真正的手工藝品  真正的
That's real craftsmanship, is what it is.

570
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:30,050
像巖石一樣硬
Solid as a rock

571
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:34,220
應該是這樣
It's supposed to do that

572
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,650
- 太完美了  伙計  - 蛋怎么樣了?
- It's perfect, guys. - And how's that egg coming?

573
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:42,050
是個雙黃蛋
This is a double yolker

574
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:52,510
我看不出這與那有...
I don't see what this has to do with...

575
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,950
你會的
You will

576
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:57,110
我們一直太辛苦了
We've been working too hard

577
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,810
應該放松一下兒  抖抖羽毛
Time to kick back a bit, shake those tail feathers

578
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,510
瞧他  扭來扭去像個...
Look at him. Nellypodging around like a...

579
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,980
啊  天啊  發生了什么事?
Oh, good heavens. What's happening?

580
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,590
這叫音節  姊妹
That's called a beat, sister.

581
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:10,520
感到全身沖動!
Feel it pulsing through your body!

582
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:14,140
啊  對  沖動  喜歡
Oh, yes. Pulsing. Fancy that

583
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:17,240
嗨  好  我們來吧  寶貝兒
Hey, well, then go with it, baby

584
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:21,940
啊  天啊  瞧! 我會跳了!
Oh, my. Look! I'm going with it!

585
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,780
邦迪  你有什么感覺?
Bunty, what's got into you?

586
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,940
很明顯跟你的一樣
Same thing that's got into you apparently

587
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:30,780

Flip flop fly I don't care if I die

588
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:31,870
就跟著樂曲走  姑娘!
Just go with the flow, gal!

589
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:36,910

Flip flop fly I don't care if I die

590
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:40,210

Don't ever leave me don't ever say good-bye

591
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:43,400
現在  看著我  我不記得批準過跳舞
Now, see here. I don't recall authorizing a hop

592
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:45,510
啊  閉嘴跳吧
Oh, shut up and dance

593
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:56,240
你哭什么  南希?
What are you sobbing about, you nancy?

594
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:58,740
此情此景  伙伴
Little moments like this, mate

595
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:02,210
這使工作充滿意義
It's what makes the job all worthwhile

596
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,440
想跳舞嗎?

600
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,540

Love me baby till the feeling hits my head like wine

601

看起來我應向你道歉
Looks like I owe you an apology

615

我以為你不關心我們

616

但經過這一切...

我們一定不要慌  不要慌!

Quiet, I say! Let's have some discipline. What, what

642
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,840
敵人抓了個俘虜
The enemy has taken a prisoner.

643
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,480
我們應該報復了
This calls for retaliation

644
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,750
報復!
Retaliation!

645
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:31,090
怎么啦? 出了什么事?

這正是他們所期望的

652
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:46,260
但我說我們意外出擊

打他們個措手不及
And catch Jerry with his trousers down

654

677
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:36,020
- 我粘住了! - 沒什么  喔
- I'm stuck! - Nothing to it. Oops

678
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:53,970
把住
Hang on!

679
00:51:58,550 --> 00:51:59,810
小心!
Look out!

680
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:10,210
調味汁


681
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,440
好!
Yes!

682
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:34,840
啊  這里像個烤箱
Oh, it's like an oven in here

683
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,670
快!
Come on!

684
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,970
等等  我來了...
Wait up! I'm com...

685
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:50,610
別丟下...
Don't leave...

686
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,470
到那...
Get over to the...

687
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,240
門! 快!
The door! Come on!

688
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:31,760
機器要爆炸了  快跑!
She's gonna blow! Run!

689
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,530
系統故障


690
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:37,400
調味汁壓力


691
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:39,840
你做了什么  大傻瓜?
What did you do, you great pudding?

692
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,840
我沒做什么!
I didn't do 'owt!

693
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:53,170
- 關上! - 關不上!
- Turn it off! - It won't turn off!

694
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,730
敦蒂太太雞肉餡餅


695
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:20,730
我們應該給其他人看看
- Ouch! - We've got to show the others

696
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,730
瞧! 我修好了!
Look! I fixed it!

697
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:38,430
雞肉餡餅?
Chicken pies?

698
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:43,660
- 對  但... - 我不想成為餡餅!
- Yes, but... - I don't want to be a pie!

699
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:45,630
我不喜歡調味汁
I don't like gravy

700
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:48,930
女士們  請保持頭腦清醒
Ladies, please. Let's not lose our heads

701
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:50,930
頭腦清醒?
Lose our heads?

702
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:01,430
我是說洛基破壞了機器
What I meant was, Rocky sabotaged the machine

703
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:03,230
為我們贏得了時間
and bought us time

704
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:07,800
更妙的是  明天他要為我們飛行
And better still, he's going to fly for us tomorrow

705
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:11,300
一旦我們看到了示范  我們就可以飛了!
And once we've seen how it's done, we'll get it!

706
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,300
因此別擔心
So don't worry

707
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,370
因為明天一切
because tomorrow everything's

708
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:17,330
都會非常順利
going to go much, much smoother

709
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:29,120
老爺爺  我又做錯什么了?
All right, Pops, what did I do now?

710
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,630
非常勇敢光榮的行動  先生
A very brave and honorable deed, sir

711
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,250
從今晚你的行動來看
In the light of your action this evening

712
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:41,130
我鄭重地承認我錯看了你
I dutifully admit that I have misjudged your character

713
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:46,990
因此我為你的勇敢  頒發給你一枚獎章
So I present you with this medal for bravery

714
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,990
并且...
And...

715
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,490
向你致敬
I salute you

716
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,420
在此光榮的時刻
In honor of the occasion

717
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:58,650
我讓出我整個床鋪
I surrender the bunk entirely

718
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,820
我去外面睡覺
I shall sleep under the stars.

719
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,820
啊  我懷著極大的期望...
Oh, uh, I await tomorrow's flying demonstration...

720
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:10,480
等著待明天的飛行示范
with great anticipation

721
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:15,660
我也是啊  老爺爺
You and me both, Pops

722
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,650
對不起  你...
- Oh! - I'm sorry. Were you...

723
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,220
這是你的... 我走了
Is this your... I'll go.

724
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,120
不  只不過
No, it's just...

725
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:30,230
因為你在這兒...
Since you're here!

726
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:31,320
我很高興  因為...
I'm glad you're here, because...

727
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:32,570
對不起  你先說
I'm sorry. You go first.

728
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:33,720
你先說  我...
You go ahead. I'll...

729
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,820
我只想說...
Um, I just wanted to say...

730
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,790
我當初可能有點兒粗魯
I may have been a bit harsh at first

731
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:44,250
啊  我真正指的是
Well, what I really mean is

732
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:46,250
謝謝你...
thank you...

733
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:48,790
救了我的命
for saving my life

734
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:51,620
救了大家的命
For saving OUR lives

735
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,780
你知道
You know

736
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:56,110
我每晚到這兒來...
I come up here every night!

737
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:57,320
來看那座山丘
and look out to that hill

738
00:56:57,390 --> 00:56:59,980
想象著山那邊的生活
and imagine what it must be like on the other side

739
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:02,490
有趣的是  我...
It's funny, I've...

740
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:06,040
從來沒感到站在草原上的感覺
I've never actually felt grass beneath my feet

741
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,050
對不起
I'm sorry

742
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,100
我現在在山丘和草地上散步
Here I am rambling on about hills and grass

743
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:11,450
你有什么話要說嗎?
and you had something to say

744
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:17,540
是這樣  你知道
Um, it's just that, y-you know

745
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:21,850
那邊兒的生活  以我來看
life, as I've experienced it, you know, out there

746
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:24,320
從孤獨自由浪人的經歷來看
lone free ranging and stuff, it's, uh

747
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:27,390
令人失望
it's full of disappointments, and, uh...

748
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,320
什么  你是說草地  不像傳說的那樣好
What, you mean grass isn't all it's cracked up to be?

749
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,320
草地! 正是  草地
Grass! Exactly. Grass

750
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:35,320
另一邊兒的草總是比較綠
It's always greener on the other side

751
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:39,980
但當你到那兒時  它就變得枯萎多刺
And then you get there and it's brown and prickly

752
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:42,070
你明白我想表達的意思嗎?
You see what I'm trying to say?

753
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,220
我想說的是...
What I'm trying to say is...

754
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:54,050
別客氣
you're welcome

755
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:56,050
你知道
You know

756
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:58,110
今晚那山丘
that hill is looking closer tonight

757
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:01,050
比任何時候離我都近
than it ever has before

758
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:09,040
哦  晚安...洛基
Well, good night...Rocky

759
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,080
晚安...姜妹
Good night...Ginger

760
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,810
各位  立正!
Company, attention!

761
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:48,580
姑娘們  今天就是  我們飛行的日子了
Today's the day, girls. We're going to fly!

762
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:50,670
我感到很興奮!
I can feel it!

763
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:54,740
終于可以看到真正的專家飛行
Finally, we get to see a real professional in action

764
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:57,750
最好開始熱身  我去叫他來
Better start warming up. I'll go and get him

765
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,750
洛基  開門
Rocky. Knock-knock.

766
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:03,240
大家在等你  我告訴他們先...
Everyone's waiting, so I told them to...

767
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:09,910
洛基?
R-Rocky?

768
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,690
啊  一門大炮
Oh, a cannon

769
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,790
當然  這可以給你動力
Aye, that would give you thrust

770
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,890
我早就知道他是騙子
I knew he was fake all along

771
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,060
實際上  我甚至懷疑  他是美國人
In fact, I'm not even certain he was American

772
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:06,860
那下一步該怎么辦  各位?
So, what's the next plan, hen?

773
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:09,030
我們面對現實吧
Let's face it

774
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:13,560
離開這兒唯一的方法  是包在餡餅里
The only way out of here is wrapped in pastry

775
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,900
也許他只是去度假了
Perhaps he just went on holiday

776
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,330
也許是逃離
Perhaps he just went to get away

777
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:19,190
你不停的編織!
from your infernal knitting!

778
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:23,840
你總是打他
You were always hitting him

779
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,600
換了你會怎樣!
See how YOU like it!

780
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,530
不要推我  四眼!
Don't push me, four-eyes!

781
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:33,700
安靜  我說安靜!
Quiet there! Quiet, I say!

782
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,250
內訌正是
Dissension in the ranks.

783
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:37,430
敵人想見到的
Precisely what Jerry would have wanted

784
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:39,190
分裂后再征服的老辦法
The old divide and conquer

785
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,670
像我們在皇家空軍那樣
A proper squadron work together

786
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:43,390
一個中隊一起工作
like we did in my R.A.F. days

787
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,430
卓高負責駕駛  法比負責導航...
Jocko at the stick, Flappy at the map...

788
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:48,930
老韋茲邦負責機尾機槍
and old Whizzbang at the tail-end Charlie

789
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:50,290
長官一聲令下
Wing Co would give the call

790
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:52,260
跳進飛機  立刻起飛!
hop in the old crate, chocks away!

791
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:55,590
魔力將引導你  獎章就是這樣獲得的
Wizard show it was. That's how you get medals

792
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,730
你能不能閉上嘴
Will you shut up about

793
01:01:57,730 --> 01:01:59,750
別談你那臭獎章!
your stupid blooming medals!

794
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,920
你怎么敢這樣!
How dare you!

795
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,380
女士  原諒我  作為一個長官
Madam, forgive me. A-As an officer

796
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:13,420
我要...
I offer my most...

797
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,860
福樂
Fowler?

798
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:37,430
各位  閉嘴!
Everyone, shut up!

799
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:47,180
福樂
Fowler

800
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:50,990
皇家空軍到底是什么?
What exactly is the R.A.F.?

801
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:53,560
你指什么  它是什么?
What do you mean, what is it?

802
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:56,150
就是皇家空軍部隊
The Royal Air Force is what.

803
01:02:56,290 --> 01:02:59,490
"老飛機" 又是什么?
Then what's the "old crate"?

804
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:04,050
就在那兒
Ahh! There she is

805
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,990
真漂亮  是不是?
Gorgeous, isn't she?

806
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:10,990
你是說  你坐過這個?
You mean, you flew in one of these?

807
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:12,450
做得真漂亮
Beautifully built.

808
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:14,490
實際上還有段故事呢
In fact, there's a bit of a story to that

809
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:16,490
我們有次去偵察  你知道
We were out on a "recce," you see

810
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:18,280
上頭說前進
Ops had given the go-ahead

811
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,490
但天氣很差
but the weather duffed up...

812
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:22,250
對  當然
Yes. Of course

813
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:25,380
我們實際上是可以成功的
We might actually be able to pull this off

814
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,850
- 我們還要飛! - 什么  什么?
- We're STILL going to fly! - What, what?

815
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,790
福樂提供了答案
Fowler's provided the answer

816
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,790
我提供了?
I have?

817

01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:30,520
再見
Bye-bye

963
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:33,680
投彈完畢!
Bombs away!

964
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:35,260
敦蒂太太!
Mr. Tweedy!

965
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:39,210
啊  這太好了  太好了!
Oh, that was good. That was good!

966
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:44,020
老家伙完蛋了!
The old bird bought it!

967
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:47,750
敦蒂太太! 敦蒂太太...
Mrs. Tweedy! Mrs. Twee...

968
01:16:47,890 --> 01:16:51,120
安全閥門  保持暢通


969
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:57,710
危險


970
01:17:19,950 --> 01:17:23,650
我告訴過你他們是有組織的
I told you they was organized

971
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,050
我們成功了  各位!
We did it, everyone!

972
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:02,580
繼續踩! 我們還沒完全成功!
Keep pedaling! We're not there yet!

973
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:09,940
別松勁  不然就到不了天堂了
You can't see paradise if you don't pedal!

974
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,940
再加把勁!
Put your drumsticks into it!

975
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:21,180
這就是我告訴他的  如此這般
That's what I told him. What, what

976
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,130
我們正在失去高度
We were losing altitude

977
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:24,980
你看  就要一頭栽地了
you see, and heading for a fearful prang

978
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:27,550
這是一個愉快的假日
This is a lovely holiday

979
01:18:27,650 --> 01:18:29,550
回去我會傷心的
I'll be sad to go back

980
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:32,510
安全永遠第一
Safety at all times is imperative

981
01:18:32,610 --> 01:18:34,510
現在  把線拉緊再...
Now, wind 'er up and...

982
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:36,510
放手
Let 'er go!

983
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:40,610
這...跟你想象的一樣嗎?
So...is it as good as you imagined?

984
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:42,800
不一樣
No.

985
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:44,540
更好
It's better.

986
01:18:46,150 --> 01:18:49,540
來  我教你打板球
Come on. I'll show you how to play cricket

987
01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:55,570
我有個問題
Here's a thought

988
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:58,910
為什么我們不拿個雞蛋  自己開一個養雞場
Why don't we get an egg and start our own chicken farm?

989
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:01,940
這樣我們就有吃不完的雞蛋
That way we'll have all the eggs we could eat

990
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:04,440
對  那么我們需要一只雞
Right. We'll need a chicken, then

991
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:06,370
不  不  我們需要一只蛋
No. No, we'll need an egg

992
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,210
你要先有蛋
You have the egg first.

993
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:09,440
然后才有雞
That's where you get the chicken from

994
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:10,170
雞之圣殿一閑人免進


995
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:12,260
不  沒有雞
No, that's cobblers. Without a chicken

996
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:13,270
哪來的蛋
where you gonna get an egg?

997
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:15,870
哪來生蛋的雞
From the chicken that comes from the egg

998
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:18,870
對  但你得先有蛋才能有雞
Yeah, but you have to have an egg to have a chicken

999
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:22,000
但是沒有雞哪來的蛋
But you gotta get the chicken first to get the egg

1000
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:25,130
哪來的蛋孵小雞
and then the egg to get the chicken out of

1001
01:19:25,210 --> 01:19:27,330
等等  我們再重來一遍
Hang on. Let's go over this again

1002
01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:30,530
劇終


1003
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,370

Yeow

1004
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:39,200

All right

1005
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:41,400

Oh yeah

1006
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:44,870

When I get the blues gon' get me a rocking chair

1007
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:49,970

When I get the blues gon' get me a rocking chair

1008
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:52,400

When the blues overtake me

1009
01:19:52,510 --> 01:19:56,000

Gonna rock on away from here ohh

1010
01:19:56,110 --> 01:19:59,200

Here comes my baby flashing a new gold tooth

1011
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:04,170

Here comes my baby flashing a new gold tooth

1012
01:20:05,370 --> 01:20:06,600

Yeah she's so small

1013
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:08,900

She can rumba in a pay phone booth

1014
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,530

That's the truth ha-ha!

1015
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:12,800

Flip flop fly

1016
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:15,300

I don't care if I die

1017
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:17,630

Flip flop fly

1018
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:19,860

I don't care if I die

1019
01:20:19,970 --> 01:20:23,840

Don't ever leave me don't ever say good-bye

1020
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:25,340

Yeow!

1021
01:20:54,530 --> 01:20:56,860

Now give me one more kiss

1022
01:20:56,970 --> 01:21:00,200

And hold it a long long time

1023
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:01,700

Give me one more kiss

1024
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:05,320

And hold it a long long time

1025
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:08,130

Love me baby till the feeling hits my head like wine

1026
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:10,290

So fine so glad that you're mine

1027
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,590

Flip flop fly

1028
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:14,930

I don't care if I die

1029
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:17,360

Flip flop fly

1030
01:21:17,470 --> 01:21:19,760

I don't care if I die

1031
01:21:19,870 --> 01:21:24,530

Don't ever leave me don't ever say good-bye

1032
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:27,390

Don't ever leave me don't ever say good-bye

1033
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:29,430

Bye-bye bye-bye

1034
01:21:29,530 --> 01:21:32,830

Don't ever leave me don't ever say good-bye

1035
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:33,960

Yeah!

1036
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:35,460

Bye-bye!

1037
01:22:55,130 --> 01:22:57,020
雞蛋  很顯然
The egg, obviously

1038
01:22:57,130 --> 01:22:59,020
很高興地滾動著
Rolling along, happy as Larry

1039
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:02,020
后來  喀嚓! 孵出了第一只雞
Then, crack! Hatches into the first chicken

1040
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:05,020
對  可是這蛋是從哪兒來的?
Yeah, but where'd the egg come from, then?

1041
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,450
你是什么意思  從哪兒來?
 What do you mean, where'd it come from?

1042
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:09,960
雞蛋高興地從地上滾來
Egg comes rolling along, happy as Larry

1043
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:12,450
它在想它是從哪兒來的?
It's wondering where'dit come from?

1044
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:15,450
沒有雞  就沒有滾動的蛋
Without a chicken, you get no egg to come rolling along

1045
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:18,450
同樣  沒有孵小雞的蛋
Well, conversely, without an egg to hatch into the chicken

1046
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,610
就沒有下蛋的雞
there will be no chicken to lay the other egg

1047
01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:22,200
沒有下蛋的雞
that hatches into the chicken

1048
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,920
哪來的蛋來孵小雞
that lays the egg I mentioned first

1049
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:25,210
- 我們現在有兩只蛋了? - 沒有
- We got two eggs now? - No

1050
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:27,410
我們仍在討論最早的那只蛋
We're still talking about the very first egg

1051
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,180
最早的那只雞呢?
What about the very first chicken?

1052
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:30,950
它在最早的那只蛋里!
He's in the very first egg!

1053
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:33,950
- 你在聽嗎? - 伙計  伙計?
- Aren't you listening? - Uh, guys. Guys?

1054
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:36,490
努力享受這里的天堂生活
Trying to enjoy paradise over here

1055
01:23:36,590 --> 01:23:38,610
- 啊  對不起  朋友  - 再說一遍
- Oh, sorry, guv. - Beg your pardon

1056
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:41,780
- 再也不會這樣了  - 謝謝
- Won't happen again. - Thanks

1057
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:44,150
- 笨蛋  - 混蛋
- Gitface. - Pillock

1058
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:46,420
以為他上了海報
Thinks he's such a big shot 'cause

1059
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:47,650
就了不起
he's got his name on a poster

1060
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:50,150
這些藝人都是這樣
These show biz folk are all the same

1061
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:53,120
- 老鼠是明星  - 是  當然是
- The rats are the stars. - Yeah, of course they are

1062
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:56,190
我們出力他出名
We do all the 'ard work, he gets all the credit

1063
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:58,280

- He gets everything. - Yes, he does. Everything
