2
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,232
l'm stuck.

3
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:36,622
Get back!

4
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:21,816
Mr. Tweedy!

5
00:03:23,227 --> 00:03:26,821
What is that chicken
doing outside the fence?

6
00:03:28,106 --> 00:03:31,815
l don't know, luv.
- Just deal with it. Now!

7
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:44,094
l'll teach you
to make a fool out of me.

8
00:03:48,224 --> 00:03:50,100
Let that be a lesson to you!

9
00:03:50,503 --> 00:03:54,576
No chicken escapes from Tweedy's farm!

10
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,030
Morning, Ginger.

11
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:09,115
Back from holiday?
- l wasn't on holiday.

12
00:07:09,521 --> 00:07:11,829
l was in solitary confinement.

13
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,118
lt's nice to get a bit of time
to yourself, isn't it?

14
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:23,831
Roll call!
Come along. You'll be late for parade.

15
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:26,070
Pip, pip. Quick march.

16
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,469
Left right ...

17
00:07:28,878 --> 00:07:30,436
Come on, smarten up!

18
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:32,317
Discipline! Order!

19
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:36,108
Back in my RAF days,
when an officer called for a scramble,

20
00:07:36,518 --> 00:07:39,429
you'd hop in the old crate
and chocks away!

21
00:07:39,837 --> 00:07:42,874
Keep over, you old fool.
They just want to count us.

22
00:07:43,277 --> 00:07:46,074
How dare you talk back
to a senior ranking officer!

23
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:49,867
Back in my RAF days ...
- Fowler, they're coming.

24
00:07:50,156 --> 00:07:51,145
Right, right!

25
00:07:53,636 --> 00:07:56,911
There'll be a reprimand, lad.
You're grounded.

26
00:07:58,835 --> 00:08:00,348
Attention!

27
00:08:05,914 --> 00:08:09,065
Welcome back, hen.
ls there a new plan?

28
00:08:23,952 --> 00:08:26,591
We've already tried going under.

29
00:08:28,392 --> 00:08:29,870
Over. Right.

30
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,263
How's the egg count?
- l laid 5 eggs today.

31
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,785
Well chuffed with that, l was.

32
00:08:54,989 --> 00:08:56,216
Oh no.

33
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:04,786
Why didn't you give her some of yours?
- She didn't tell me.

34
00:09:05,187 --> 00:09:06,700
She didn't tell anyone.

35
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,342
ls Edwina off on holiday?

36
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:17,615
We've got to get out of here.

37
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:22,774
Are we still on?
- We're on, all right.

38
00:10:23,178 --> 00:10:26,090
Spread the word, Mac.
Meeting tonight in Hut 17.

39
00:10:53,135 --> 00:10:54,124
You called?

40
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,930
Nick and ...
- Fetcher. - At your service.

41
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:03,853
Over here.

42
00:11:07,493 --> 00:11:10,644
We need more things.
- Right you are, Miss.

43
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:12,930
How about this quality tea set?

44
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,765
A lovely necklace and pendant.

45
00:11:15,172 --> 00:11:19,404
Or this number. All the rage in
the fashionable Paris chicken coops.

46
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,322
Simply pop it on,
and as the French say: "Voila!"

47
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:24,925
That is French.

48
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:29,449
lt's two hats in one, Miss.
For parties. For weddings.

49
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,085
Madame, you look like a vision,
like a dream.

50
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,004
Like a duck.
- No, thank you.

51
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,641
We're making this. We need this.
Can you get it?

52
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:45,239
This is a big job, Miss.
Bigger than the others.

53
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:49,244
This will cost.
- The usual: one bag of seed.

54
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:51,764
You call this pay?
- lt's chicken feed.

55
00:11:52,168 --> 00:11:54,636
What could we give you?
- Eggs.

56
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,084
We can't. Our eggs are too valuable.

57
00:11:58,487 --> 00:11:59,806
So are we.

58
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:03,242
After you, Fetcher.

59
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:06,396
After l what?

60
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,559
Move!

61
00:12:32,204 --> 00:12:34,512
Stupid, worthless creatures!

62
00:12:35,803 --> 00:12:39,034
l'm sick and tired
of making minuscule profits.

63
00:12:59,401 --> 00:13:00,628
Oh, yes.

64
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,311
Those chickens are up to something.

65
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,473
Quiet.
l'm onto something.

66
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,312
They're organized.

67
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:11,028
Quiet!
- That ginger one

68
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:12,554
is their leader.

69
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:18,474
l may have found a way
to make some real money.

70
00:13:18,878 --> 00:13:22,587
What are you on about? Ridiculous
notions of escaping chickens.

71
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:27,508
lt's all in your head,
Mr. Tweedy. Say it.

72
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:29,908
lt's all in my head.

73
00:13:30,317 --> 00:13:32,672
Now you keep telling yourself that,

74
00:13:33,077 --> 00:13:36,910
because l won't hear another word
about it. ls that clear?

75
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,272
Yes, luv.

76
00:13:39,676 --> 00:13:40,586
But the ginger one!

77
00:13:40,996 --> 00:13:44,385
They're chickens, you dolt!
Apart from you,

78
00:13:44,795 --> 00:13:47,355
they're the most stupid creatures
on the planet!

79
00:13:47,755 --> 00:13:50,110
They don't plot,
they don't scheme,

80
00:13:50,515 --> 00:13:52,505
and they're not organized!

81
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:56,029
Order! Order!

82
00:13:56,434 --> 00:13:58,231
Quiet, everyone.

83
00:13:58,634 --> 00:14:00,067
Settle down.

84
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:04,148
l would like to call to order ...
- Quiet!

85
00:14:05,193 --> 00:14:07,627
Discipline in the ranks!
What! What!

86
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:10,705
Thank you, Fowler.
- ln my RAF days, we never wasted time

87
00:14:11,112 --> 00:14:14,866
with unnecessary chitchat.
- Yes, thank you, Fowler.

88
00:14:19,711 --> 00:14:20,985
Right.

89
00:14:24,351 --> 00:14:25,545
Carry on.

90
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:31,344
Our last escape attempt
was a bit of a fiasco,

91
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,945
but Mac and l have a new plan.

92
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,342
Show them, Mac. - We tried going
under that wire, and it didn't work.

93
00:14:38,749 --> 00:14:40,899
So the plan is: we go

94
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:42,822
over it.

95
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:47,463
This is us, right?
We get in like this

96
00:14:47,868 --> 00:14:50,098
and wind her up, and

97
00:14:50,508 --> 00:14:51,179
let her go!

98
00:14:56,387 --> 00:14:59,459
Good grief!
The turnip's bought it.

99
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:03,619
Farmer's coming!

100
00:15:08,506 --> 00:15:10,064
Operation Cover-Up!

101
00:15:36,822 --> 00:15:38,494
Mr. Tweedy,

102
00:15:39,582 --> 00:15:40,981
where are you?

103
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,656
lt's all in your head.

104
00:15:49,661 --> 00:15:52,778
Think, everyone.
What haven't we tried yet?

105
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,369
We haven't tried
not trying to escape.

106
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,249
Might work.

107
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,933
What about Edwina?

108
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,649
How many more empty nests
will it take?

109
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:07,653
Maybe she should have spent more time
laying eggs

110
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:10,493
and less time escaping.
- Laying eggs,

111
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:14,015
then getting plucked and roasted
is good enough for you?

112
00:16:15,178 --> 00:16:16,213
lt's a living.

113
00:16:18,098 --> 00:16:20,009
The fences aren't just
around the farm.

114
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:23,011
They're up here in your heads.

115
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:25,487
There is a better place out there.

116
00:16:26,257 --> 00:16:28,452
Somewhere beyond that hill,

117
00:16:29,016 --> 00:16:32,133
it has wide open spaces
and lots of trees.

118
00:16:32,936 --> 00:16:35,973
And grass. Can you imagine that?

119
00:16:36,376 --> 00:16:38,491
Cool, green grass.

120
00:16:38,895 --> 00:16:40,089
Who feeds us?

121
00:16:40,655 --> 00:16:42,805
We feed ourselves.
- Where's the farm?

122
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:46,207
There is no farm.
- Then where does the farmer live?

123
00:16:46,614 --> 00:16:49,174
There is no farmer.
- ls he on holiday?

124
00:16:49,574 --> 00:16:51,690
He isn't anywhere.
Don't you get it?

125
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,210
No egg count,
no farmers, no dogs,

126
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:57,650
no coops and keys
and no fences!

127
00:16:59,093 --> 00:17:02,972
ln all my life
l've never heard such a fantastic

128
00:17:03,373 --> 00:17:05,010
load of tripe!

129
00:17:06,452 --> 00:17:08,329
Face the facts, ducks.

130
00:17:08,732 --> 00:17:11,087
The chance of us getting out
are a million to one.

131
00:17:13,171 --> 00:17:14,809
Then there's still a chance!

132
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:38,400
Oh, no!

133
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,925
Who am l fooling?
l can't lead this bunch of ...

134
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,484
Heaven help us.

135
00:17:57,766 --> 00:18:00,803
Freedom!

136
00:18:19,124 --> 00:18:21,592
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've been a wonderful audience.

137
00:18:39,042 --> 00:18:40,599
That's it.

138
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,436
lnside, quickly!

139
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,232
Here's our way out!

140
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,039
We'll make posters?

141
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,758
What's on the posters, Babs?
We'll fly out.

142
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:02,708
Must be important to be on a poster.
l wonder what he does.

143
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:05,872
Obviously,
he's a professional flying rooster.

144
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,473
Flies around giving demonstrations.

145
00:19:08,878 --> 00:19:10,914
Do you suppose?
- Absolutely!

146
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:13,346
No, not in there!

147
00:19:13,758 --> 00:19:15,156
Get out!

148
00:19:22,197 --> 00:19:25,552
Who are you? Where am l?
What happened to my wing?

149
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,265
You took a nasty fall.
- Spraining the anterior tendon

150
00:19:28,676 --> 00:19:32,190
connecting the radius to the humerus.
l wrapped it.

151
00:19:32,595 --> 00:19:34,984
Was that English?
- She fixed your wing.

152
00:19:35,355 --> 00:19:38,028
l made the bandage.
- l carried you in.

153
00:19:43,354 --> 00:19:45,629
Back up and start from the top.
Where am l?

154
00:19:46,034 --> 00:19:50,823
How rude of us. We're just excited ...
This is a chicken farm.

155
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,825
And we're the chickens.

156
00:19:53,553 --> 00:19:55,509
With you so far.
Chicken farm, chickens.

157
00:19:56,193 --> 00:19:57,785
l don't like his look.

158
00:19:58,193 --> 00:19:59,944
His eyes are too close together.

159
00:20:00,352 --> 00:20:04,027
And he's a Yank! - Cockfighting's
illegal where l come from.

160
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:08,868
Where is that? - A place l call
home of the free, land of the brave.

161
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:10,306
Scotland!

162
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,224
No! America.

163
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:16,618
Poppycock!

164
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,942
Pushy Americans.
Always showing up late for every war.

165
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,346
Overpaid, oversexed
and over here.

166
00:20:24,749 --> 00:20:28,298
What's eating grandpa?
- Don't mind him, Mister ...

167
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:32,145
My name's Rocky, the Rhode lsland Red.
Rhodes for short.

168
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:33,867
Rocky Rhodes!

169
00:20:34,268 --> 00:20:35,747
Catchy, ain't it?

170
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,619
Mr. Rhodes, is this you?

171
00:20:39,908 --> 00:20:41,944
Who wants to know?

172
00:20:42,347 --> 00:20:45,783
A group of desperate chickens.
lf it's you,

173
00:20:46,187 --> 00:20:48,098
you may be the answer to our prayers.

174
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:56,100
Then call me a miracle, dollface,
'cause that's me.

175
00:20:57,466 --> 00:21:00,059
What brings you to England,
Mr. Rhodes?

176
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,980
All the beautiful English chicks,
of course.

177
00:21:03,385 --> 00:21:05,137
Give over!

178
00:21:06,985 --> 00:21:11,182
l'm a traveler.
l did that barnyard thing for a while,

179
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:14,098
but couldn't get into it.
Hi. How are you?

180
00:21:14,504 --> 00:21:15,380
Nope!

181
00:21:15,784 --> 00:21:19,856
The open road is more my style.
Put a pack on my back

182
00:21:20,263 --> 00:21:21,935
and point me where the wind blows.

183
00:21:22,743 --> 00:21:24,893
Know what they call me back home?

184
00:21:25,303 --> 00:21:28,738
You'll love this.
The Lone Free-Ranger.

185
00:21:30,062 --> 00:21:31,541
lsn't that great?

186
00:21:32,182 --> 00:21:34,093
l knew it was possible.
- lt's possible!

187
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,820
The answer had to come!
- Amen!

188
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:40,294
We'll fly over that fence, and
Mr. Rhodes will show us how. Right?

189
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:44,488
That's ri ... What?
Did you say "fly?"

190
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,334
You can teach us.
- No, l can't.

191
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,173
Listen! You hear that?

192
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,017
The open road's calling,
and l have to answer.

193
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:55,489
Bye.

194
00:21:56,699 --> 00:21:58,769
He must have very good hearing.

195
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:02,372
Okay, where's the exit?
This way.

196
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:06,657
Mr. Rhodes? Perhaps l didn't explain
our situation properly.

197
00:22:07,058 --> 00:22:08,935
We lay eggs, day in, day out.

198
00:22:09,337 --> 00:22:11,646
When we can't lay any more,
they kill us.

199
00:22:12,617 --> 00:22:15,814
lt's a cruel world, dollface.
Better get used to it.

200
00:22:16,217 --> 00:22:18,730
Which part of "they kill us"
don't you understand?

201
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,774
l got my own set of problems.

202
00:22:21,176 --> 00:22:23,326
Besides, it can't be
that hard to bust out of here.

203
00:22:23,736 --> 00:22:25,772
Watch me.

204
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:31,086
lt's not so hard for a chicken or two
to get out, but it's about all of us.

205
00:22:33,695 --> 00:22:37,846
All of you? - l've been trying
to tell you. - Let's get it straight.

206
00:22:38,254 --> 00:22:41,849
You want to get every chicken
out of here at once?

207
00:22:42,254 --> 00:22:44,847
Of course.
- You're certifiable.

208
00:22:45,253 --> 00:22:48,609
You can't pull that off.
- Where there's a will, there's a way.

209
00:22:49,013 --> 00:22:52,971
Couldn't agree more.
And l will be leaving. That way.

210
00:22:53,652 --> 00:22:55,563
Mr. Rhodes, please!

211
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:19,848
So that's it.
You're from the circus.

212
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:23,640
You're on the run, aren't you?

213
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:28,123
Keep it down!
l'm trying to lay low here.

214
00:23:29,168 --> 00:23:32,399
l should turn you in right now.
- You wouldn't.

215
00:23:32,808 --> 00:23:34,526
Would you?
- Why not?

216
00:23:34,928 --> 00:23:36,997
Because l'm cute?

217
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:43,276
Hey, hey. You crazy chick!

218
00:23:43,687 --> 00:23:46,439
You know what'll happen
if he finds me? - lt's a cruel world.

219
00:23:46,846 --> 00:23:50,043
l don't like you.
- l don't care.

220
00:23:50,446 --> 00:23:53,995
Show us how to fly. - With this wing?
- Teach us, then.

221
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:58,761
He's valuable, you say?

222
00:23:59,165 --> 00:24:01,121
Sure.
- Get the torch.

223
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,158
Listen here, sister.
l'm not going back to that life.

224
00:24:04,564 --> 00:24:07,032
l'm a Lone Free-Ranger.
Emphasis on "free."

225
00:24:07,444 --> 00:24:09,833
And that's what we want ...
freedom.

226
00:24:13,963 --> 00:24:15,601
Fancy that, they're coming.

227
00:24:16,003 --> 00:24:17,641
Oh, no! They're onto me!

228
00:24:18,043 --> 00:24:21,557
Teach us to fly. We'll hide you.
- And if l don't?

229
00:24:22,722 --> 00:24:25,282
Was your father by any chance
a vulture?

230
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,958
Do we have a deal?

231
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,117
Time to make good on that deal,
dollface. - The name is Ginger.

232
00:25:07,117 --> 00:25:08,914
Comfortable?
- Not really.

233
00:25:09,317 --> 00:25:11,148
Maybe this will help.

234
00:25:13,396 --> 00:25:16,388
Nice hideout.
l had more room in my egg.

235
00:25:16,796 --> 00:25:19,868
We held up our end of it.
Tomorrow you hold up yours.

236
00:25:20,276 --> 00:25:21,833
What deal?
- Flying.

237
00:25:22,235 --> 00:25:25,511
Oh, yeah. Don't worry.
l'll teach you everything l know.

238
00:25:25,915 --> 00:25:28,748
Which bunk is mine?

239
00:25:31,474 --> 00:25:34,591
Absolutely outrageous!

240
00:25:34,994 --> 00:25:37,428
Asking a senior officer
to share his quarters.

241
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:40,301
And with a non-commissioned Yank,
no less!

242
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:42,431
Why, back in my day ...

243
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,222
You weren't exactly
my first choice either.

244
00:25:46,033 --> 00:25:48,227
Scoot over. Your wing's
on my side of the bunk.

245
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:53,103
Your side of the bunk?
The whole bunk is my side!

246
00:25:54,192 --> 00:25:57,183
What is that smell?
ls that your breath?

247
00:25:57,591 --> 00:26:00,310
Absolutely outrageous!

248
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,463
So you want to fly, huh?

249
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:12,506
Well, it ain't going to be easy. And
it ain't going to happen overnight.

250
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,423
Flying takes three things:
hard work,

251
00:26:15,829 --> 00:26:17,501
perseverance and

252
00:26:19,069 --> 00:26:21,458
hard work.
- You said "hard work" twice!

253
00:26:21,869 --> 00:26:24,826
Because it takes twice as much
hard work as perseverance.

254
00:26:26,548 --> 00:26:27,981
Codswallop!

255
00:26:28,388 --> 00:26:30,538
Cocky Yanks
think they know it all.

256
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:35,585
The most important thing is
we have to work as a team.

257
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:39,544
Which means,
you do everything l tell you.

258
00:26:43,266 --> 00:26:45,541
Let's rock 'n roll.

259
00:27:25,021 --> 00:27:26,613
The chickens are ...

260
00:27:27,661 --> 00:27:28,935
... pecking?

261
00:27:30,261 --> 00:27:32,490
And left, two, three.

262
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,538
And right, two, three.

263
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,419
And stop right there.

264
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,932
Yes, down.

265
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,093
Make little circles.

266
00:27:42,499 --> 00:27:43,932
Faster.

267
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:49,930
Oh, that's the spot!

268
00:28:00,177 --> 00:28:02,896
l thought
you were going to teach us to fly.

269
00:28:03,297 --> 00:28:05,367
That's what l'm doing.

270
00:28:05,777 --> 00:28:08,370
lsn't there usually
some flapping involved?

271
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:11,327
Do l tell you how to lay eggs?

272
00:28:11,736 --> 00:28:14,045
Relax.
We're making progress.

273
00:28:14,456 --> 00:28:17,811
Really? l can't help feeling
we're going around in circles.

274
00:28:19,295 --> 00:28:23,174
Hey, cut it out!
You're making me dizzy.

275
00:28:23,575 --> 00:28:25,451
They're ready to fly now.

276
00:28:25,854 --> 00:28:27,810
Good, 'cause they can't walk anymore.

277
00:28:30,734 --> 00:28:31,928
Up and at 'em!

278
00:28:32,334 --> 00:28:33,402
Let's flap.

279
00:28:38,573 --> 00:28:42,360
Let's see if old Attila the Hen
has come to her senses.

280
00:28:50,052 --> 00:28:51,769
lt's raining hen!

281
00:28:56,451 --> 00:29:00,284
What's this caper, luv?
- We're flying. - Obviously.

282
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:05,359
Flipping hell. Look at this.
- They're going to kill themselves.

283
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,809
Want to watch?
- All right.

284
00:29:19,648 --> 00:29:21,878
Careful of those eggs!

285
00:29:26,327 --> 00:29:28,124
Sunny-side up.

286
00:29:31,127 --> 00:29:32,446
Now over easy.

287
00:29:35,246 --> 00:29:36,884
Definitely scrambled.

288
00:29:43,925 --> 00:29:45,916
Poultry in motion.

289
00:29:59,404 --> 00:30:01,598
Birds of a feather
flop together.

290
00:30:07,203 --> 00:30:08,795
Great work, ladies.

291
00:30:09,203 --> 00:30:12,114
The pain you're feeling
is a good thing.

292
00:30:12,522 --> 00:30:13,875
Pain is your friend.

293
00:30:14,282 --> 00:30:17,797
Just keep the faith ...
Agnes. You'll get there.

294
00:30:18,201 --> 00:30:19,839
You flew four feet today.

295
00:30:20,241 --> 00:30:23,551
Yeah, four feet.
From the roof to the ground.

296
00:30:23,961 --> 00:30:28,397
All part of the process. Don't worry.
You cheesy little ...

297
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,357
That doesn't sound good.

298
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,839
The ground's shaking.
Are we worried?

299
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:38,832
Are we worried?

300
00:30:46,118 --> 00:30:47,915
The circus! Quick! Hide me!

301
00:30:48,318 --> 00:30:50,070
Hide me!
- Come on.

302
00:30:50,478 --> 00:30:51,797
One isn't awarded a medal

303
00:30:52,198 --> 00:30:54,950
for flapping about like a lunatic.

304
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:58,831
Now see here!
This is an officer's quarters!

305
00:30:59,237 --> 00:31:00,955
ln here!
- Get out of here now!

306
00:31:01,437 --> 00:31:03,154
Give it a rest, Pops!

307
00:31:03,996 --> 00:31:06,908
What? l shall have you
on charges within the week!

308
00:31:43,552 --> 00:31:44,541
Cheers, mate.

309
00:31:52,031 --> 00:31:54,305
lt's all in your head.

310
00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:05,540
What's all this?

311
00:32:05,949 --> 00:32:07,780
This is our future, Mr. Tweedy.

312
00:32:08,189 --> 00:32:10,623
No more wasting time
with petty egg collection

313
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,258
and minuscule profits.
- No eggs?

314
00:32:13,668 --> 00:32:16,228
We've always been egg farmers.
My father,

315
00:32:16,628 --> 00:32:18,983
his father and their fathers.
They were always ...

316
00:32:19,388 --> 00:32:22,663
Poor! Worthless! Nothings!

317
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:24,659
But that's about to change.

318
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:28,025
This will take Tweedy's farm
out of the Dark Ages

319
00:32:28,427 --> 00:32:31,941
and into full-scale
automated production.

320
00:32:33,946 --> 00:32:36,699
Melisha Tweedy
will be poor no longer.

321
00:32:40,465 --> 00:32:42,421
l'll put it together,
shall l?

322
00:32:48,544 --> 00:32:51,456
That isn't good.
Whatever's in those boxes is for us.

323
00:32:51,864 --> 00:32:53,661
And l doubt it's softer than hay.

324
00:32:54,064 --> 00:32:56,179
l hate to be the voice of doom,

325
00:32:56,583 --> 00:33:00,815
but l've been calculating.
l don't think we're built for flying.

326
00:33:01,223 --> 00:33:04,373
But l saw him!
He flew in over that fence!

327
00:33:04,862 --> 00:33:06,420
l believe you,

328
00:33:06,822 --> 00:33:10,576
but if we could see it for ourselves
it might answer some questions.

329
00:33:11,382 --> 00:33:14,930
You're right. We've been at this
all week. We're getting nowhere.

330
00:33:15,341 --> 00:33:19,459
lf his wing were better ...
l'll talk to him.

331
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,459
Where is he?

332
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,657
They didn't give me this medal
for being a Yank nanny.

333
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:33,929
"l don't know" would suffice.

334
00:33:34,339 --> 00:33:37,411
Beware of that one,
young Ginger.

335
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:40,127
That Yank is not to be trusted.

336
00:33:40,898 --> 00:33:43,935
That Yank
is our ticket out of here.

337
00:33:44,338 --> 00:33:48,171
And the pig says to the horse,
"Why the long face?"

338
00:33:54,137 --> 00:33:55,365
Cocktail!

339
00:33:56,176 --> 00:33:57,006
Give over!

340
00:34:04,056 --> 00:34:05,727
So anyway ...

341
00:34:06,535 --> 00:34:09,129
Remember those flying tips.

342
00:34:09,535 --> 00:34:12,208
They're very important.
And think flighty thoughts.

343
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:16,967
They're swell chicks.

344
00:34:17,374 --> 00:34:20,969
Look what Babs made me. A beak warmer.
lsn't that cute?

345
00:34:22,613 --> 00:34:26,447
And that Bunty.
She really packs a pun.

346
00:34:26,853 --> 00:34:27,888
A problem?

347
00:34:28,293 --> 00:34:31,523
Have we flown over the fence?
- Not quite. - There's a problem.

348
00:34:31,932 --> 00:34:33,604
Good things come to those who wait.

349
00:34:43,971 --> 00:34:47,850
How long did it take you?
- To do what? - To learn to fly.

350
00:34:48,251 --> 00:34:50,969
Apples and oranges.
l'm gifted, they're not.

351
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:55,409
You can't compare the two.
These things take time.

352
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:59,802
Which we're running out of. Why
haven't we lifted off yet? - Thrust.

353
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:04,242
l went over my calculations.
What we're missing is thrust.

354
00:35:07,888 --> 00:35:09,321
l didn't get a word of that.

355
00:35:09,728 --> 00:35:13,641
Thrust. When ducks and geese take off,
what do they have?

356
00:35:14,008 --> 00:35:16,077
She ain't using real words.

357
00:35:16,487 --> 00:35:19,001
She said we need more thrust.
- Thrust!

358
00:35:19,407 --> 00:35:22,922
Sure. Thrust and flying
are like this.

359
00:35:23,327 --> 00:35:24,475
Flying and thrust.

360
00:35:24,886 --> 00:35:26,717
Will you excuse us?

361
00:35:28,286 --> 00:35:29,435
The wing!

362
00:35:29,846 --> 00:35:32,803
No results by tomorrow,
and the deal's off.

363
00:35:33,205 --> 00:35:37,756
No more hiding. The farmers'll find
you and back to the circus, fly boy.

364
00:35:38,165 --> 00:35:41,201
You're the first chick l ever met
with the shell still on.

365
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:46,517
Sleep tight, angel face.
The Rock's on the case.

366
00:35:58,522 --> 00:36:00,240
What? What?

367
00:36:01,962 --> 00:36:03,554
A beaut. A fine piece of work.

368
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:06,192
lf l do say so myself.

369
00:36:06,602 --> 00:36:09,161
l say so myself, too.
- Wish l'd seen it.

370
00:36:09,561 --> 00:36:13,236
We slipped into the farmer's room.
- Like a fish.

371
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:14,756
And we ...

372
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,319
Like a fish?

373
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,995
You stupid idiot!

374
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,038
Anyway, here it is.

375
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,476
El merchandiso!
- That's Spanish.

376
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:26,676
What're these two crooks doing here?

377
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:30,674
So, you know each other!
- She don't think we're valuable.

378
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:32,478
You guys are

379
00:36:32,879 --> 00:36:36,234
the sneakiest,
thieving parasites l've ever met.

380
00:36:36,638 --> 00:36:40,028
Don't. Stop it.
- l've gone bright red.

381
00:36:40,438 --> 00:36:41,917
So, how about the eggs?

382
00:36:42,317 --> 00:36:44,035
Eggs? You promised them ...

383
00:36:44,437 --> 00:36:46,632
Yep, l promised them
every egg l lay this month.

384
00:36:47,037 --> 00:36:49,835
When can we expect
the first one?

385
00:36:50,237 --> 00:36:53,433
l'm brewing one up now.
l'll keep you posted.

386
00:36:54,836 --> 00:36:57,430
A pleasure doing business
with you.

387
00:36:58,236 --> 00:36:59,509
Sucker.

388
00:37:01,475 --> 00:37:03,227
What?
- You lied to them.

389
00:37:03,635 --> 00:37:07,867
l didn't lie, dollface.
l just omitted certain truths.

390
00:37:08,274 --> 00:37:11,391
l'll give them what l promised.
- Nothing. - Which they'll get.

391
00:37:11,794 --> 00:37:13,864
And what will you give us?

392
00:37:14,874 --> 00:37:16,512
Thrust.

393
00:37:18,793 --> 00:37:20,590
You okay, sweetheart? Good, good.

394
00:37:23,673 --> 00:37:27,381
Now this will get you going.
lt's a thrust exercise.

395
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:31,023
The tension's killing me.
- lt's gonna kill her.

396
00:37:31,432 --> 00:37:32,467
Release!

397
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:39,827
Come on, flap!

398
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,982
You can do it. Flap!

399
00:37:54,429 --> 00:37:57,148
ls that your first of-fence?

400
00:38:11,787 --> 00:38:13,379
Roll call!

401
00:38:13,987 --> 00:38:15,306
l haven't laid any eggs.

402
00:38:15,707 --> 00:38:17,823
Three days, not one.

403
00:38:19,066 --> 00:38:21,785
Why didn't you tell us?
- l was so busy flying ...

404
00:38:22,186 --> 00:38:23,904
They're coming!
- Hide me!

405
00:38:24,306 --> 00:38:26,217
Hide yourself!

406
00:39:25,379 --> 00:39:27,131
Double their food rations.

407
00:39:27,978 --> 00:39:30,367
l want them all as fat as this one.

408
00:39:34,978 --> 00:39:38,014
All of my life
flashed before my eyes.

409
00:39:39,337 --> 00:39:40,850
lt was really boring.

410
00:39:43,457 --> 00:39:44,526
Chicken feed!

411
00:39:45,097 --> 00:39:46,768
My favorite!

412
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,525
Wait!

413
00:39:55,575 --> 00:39:56,564
No, wait!

414
00:39:59,735 --> 00:40:01,487
Babs, please! Bunty.

415
00:40:01,895 --> 00:40:03,771
Stop it! Wait!

416
00:40:04,174 --> 00:40:05,653
Stop!

417
00:40:10,934 --> 00:40:11,922
Stop it!

418
00:40:14,013 --> 00:40:17,528
Something is wrong here.
Can't you see that?

419
00:40:19,453 --> 00:40:22,330
Strange boxes arrive.
Babs stops laying,

420
00:40:22,732 --> 00:40:25,007
but she isn't taken to the chop.
Extra food.

421
00:40:25,412 --> 00:40:28,324
Don't you see?
They're fattening us up.

422
00:40:28,732 --> 00:40:30,210
They're going to kill us all!

423
00:40:33,651 --> 00:40:35,482
Heavy alert!

424
00:40:36,171 --> 00:40:40,243
She didn't mean that, gals.
- Do you mind? - Save some for me.

425
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,242
What are you doing?

426
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,199
Let go!

427
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:48,568
l've met some hard-boiled eggs before,
but you're about 20 minutes.

428
00:40:48,969 --> 00:40:51,529
Meaning what?
- Meaning, lighten up.

429
00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:54,841
ln America we have a rule:
To motivate someone,

430
00:40:55,248 --> 00:40:56,647
don't mention death!

431
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,405
Funny. Over here the rule is:
Always tell the truth!

432
00:41:00,808 --> 00:41:02,719
lt's been working like a charm.

433
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:06,676
You want them to perform,
tell them what they want to hear.

434
00:41:07,087 --> 00:41:08,725
You mean lie?

435
00:41:09,127 --> 00:41:10,560
Here we go again.

436
00:41:10,967 --> 00:41:14,276
Know what your problem is?
You're ... difficult.

437
00:41:14,686 --> 00:41:16,483
Why? Because l'm honest?

438
00:41:16,886 --> 00:41:20,435
l care about them.
Something the Lone Free-Ranger

439
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:24,360
doesn't know about.
- Then l hope you never care about me.

440
00:41:24,765 --> 00:41:26,995
l never will.
- Good. - Fine.

441
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:16,513
What's all this?

442
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,637
Here she is.
Ask and you shall receive.

443
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:23,956
That's biblical.
- That's real craftsmanship.

444
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:25,757
Solid as a rock.

445
00:42:28,398 --> 00:42:29,877
lt's supposed to do that.

446
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,150
Perfect, guys.

447
00:42:32,797 --> 00:42:34,116
How's that egg coming?

448
00:42:34,517 --> 00:42:37,395
This is a double yolker.

449
00:42:46,156 --> 00:42:48,828
l don't see what it has to do with ...
- You will.

450
00:42:49,795 --> 00:42:54,073
We've been working hard. Let's relax
and shake those tail feathers.

451
00:42:54,475 --> 00:42:57,511
Look at him!
Nellpodging around like a ...

452
00:42:57,914 --> 00:42:58,869
Good heavens!

453
00:42:59,274 --> 00:43:00,389
What's happening?

454
00:43:00,794 --> 00:43:02,864
That's called a beat. Feel it

455
00:43:03,274 --> 00:43:05,629
pulsing through your body?

456
00:43:06,033 --> 00:43:07,785
Oh yes. Who'd have guessed?

457
00:43:08,193 --> 00:43:10,024
Then go with it, baby!

458
00:43:13,953 --> 00:43:15,670
Look, l'm going with it!

459
00:43:16,072 --> 00:43:18,028
Bunty, what's got into you?

460
00:43:18,432 --> 00:43:20,468
Same thing that's got into you.

461
00:43:23,591 --> 00:43:25,229
Just go with the flow.

462
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:36,182
l don't recall
authorizing a hop.

463
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,308
Shut up and dance.

464
00:43:45,549 --> 00:43:48,461
What are you sobbing about,
you nancy?

465
00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:50,506
Little moments like this ...

466
00:43:50,908 --> 00:43:54,105
it's what makes the job
all worthwhile.

467
00:43:57,428 --> 00:43:58,940
Want to dance?

468
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:03,296
Yeah, all right.

469
00:44:46,542 --> 00:44:49,295
Did you see that? l flew!

470
00:44:49,702 --> 00:44:51,817
Atta girl, Babsy! Atta girl.

471
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:54,736
Your wing! lt's better!

472
00:44:56,141 --> 00:44:57,733
How about that?
- Fantastic!

473
00:44:58,141 --> 00:45:01,018
You can fly for us tomorrow.

474
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,297
Yeah, so it seems.

475
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,452
l flew!

476
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,855
l owe you an apology.

477
00:45:09,259 --> 00:45:12,057
l didn't think you cared,
but after all this ...

478
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:14,848
Well, it seems l was wrong.

479
00:45:15,419 --> 00:45:17,648
Easy, Miss Hard-Boiled.

480
00:45:18,058 --> 00:45:20,094
l might think you're turning soft.

481
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:28,449
Listen.
l have to tell you something.

482
00:45:36,256 --> 00:45:38,565
No! You'd better wait.

483
00:46:02,173 --> 00:46:05,051
That's champion ...
What is it?

484
00:46:05,453 --> 00:46:07,921
A pie machine, you idiot. Chickens

485
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:12,484
go in. Pies come out.
- What kind of pies?

486
00:46:12,892 --> 00:46:13,881
Apple.

487
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:15,122
My favorite.

488
00:46:15,532 --> 00:46:20,127
Chicken pies, you lummox!
lmagine:

489
00:46:20,691 --> 00:46:25,446
ln less than a fortnight, every grocer
will be stocked with boxes

490
00:46:25,851 --> 00:46:29,479
of Mrs. Tweedy's
Homemade Chicken Pies.

491
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:34,088
Just "Mrs."? - Woman's touch.
Makes the public feel comfortable.

492
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:37,085
Oh, right. How does it work?

493
00:46:37,489 --> 00:46:40,322
Get me a chicken,
and l'll show you.

494
00:46:41,689 --> 00:46:43,998
l know just the one.

495
00:46:47,928 --> 00:46:50,567
l've got a score to settle with you.

496
00:46:50,968 --> 00:46:53,037
Bloomin' heck! They've got Ginger!

497
00:46:58,127 --> 00:47:00,925
We mustn't panic! We mustn't panic!

498
00:47:04,686 --> 00:47:07,564
Quiet, l say!
Let's have some discipline!

499
00:47:07,966 --> 00:47:10,354
The enemy has a prisoner.
This calls

500
00:47:10,765 --> 00:47:14,883
for retaliation! Retaliation!
- What's going on?

501
00:47:15,285 --> 00:47:18,800
They got Ginger.
They're taking her to the chop!

502
00:47:19,204 --> 00:47:20,876
What are you waiting for, laddie?

503
00:47:21,284 --> 00:47:22,637
Fly over there. Save her.

504
00:47:23,044 --> 00:47:25,114
Of course! No!

505
00:47:25,524 --> 00:47:29,402
Just what they'd expect.
Give them the old element of surprise!

506
00:47:29,803 --> 00:47:32,442
And catch Jerry
with his trousers down!

507
00:47:32,843 --> 00:47:34,435
l like that. What's the plan?

508
00:47:34,843 --> 00:47:36,798
The plan ...

509
00:47:37,202 --> 00:47:38,715
The plan ... Babs!

510
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:41,920
Give me that thing.
Bunty, give me a boost.

511
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,791
Look at the size of that thing.

512
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,034
Oh, no.

513
00:48:04,879 --> 00:48:06,517
Chickens go in,

514
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:08,678
pies come out.

515
00:48:12,838 --> 00:48:15,113
Chicken pies. Not apple pies.

516
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:16,951
Chicken!

517
00:48:24,077 --> 00:48:26,193
Great! Brilliant!

518
00:48:26,597 --> 00:48:27,632
Yo! Baby doll!

519
00:48:28,637 --> 00:48:30,308
l'm coming!
- Hurry!

520
00:48:32,116 --> 00:48:35,313
l'm still coming!
- Come on! Stop this thing!

521
00:48:36,036 --> 00:48:37,389
l'm getting there.

522
00:48:40,195 --> 00:48:41,389
Shoot!

523
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:45,985
l'll be down before you can say ...

524
00:48:46,634 --> 00:48:48,147
mixed vegetables?

525
00:49:09,432 --> 00:49:10,501
D'oh! Get it?

526
00:49:10,912 --> 00:49:12,549
Dough.
- l'm stuck!

527
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:14,270
Nothing to it.

528
00:49:30,429 --> 00:49:31,418
Hang on.

529
00:49:36,669 --> 00:49:37,658
Look out.

530
00:50:09,345 --> 00:50:11,700
lt's like an oven in here.

531
00:50:20,544 --> 00:50:21,693
Come on!

532
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:26,052
Wait!

533
00:50:27,063 --> 00:50:28,416
Go over to the ...

534
00:50:39,782 --> 00:50:41,453
The door! Come on!

535
00:51:03,859 --> 00:51:06,930
She's gonna blow! Run!

536
00:51:11,698 --> 00:51:15,610
What did you do,
you great pudding? - Nothing.

537
00:51:23,736 --> 00:51:26,489
Turn it off!
- lt won't turn off!

538
00:51:50,893 --> 00:51:52,929
We've got to show the others. Come on!

539
00:52:01,692 --> 00:52:03,683
Look. l fixed it.

540
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:09,802
Chicken pies?

541
00:52:10,811 --> 00:52:11,800
Yes, but ...

542
00:52:12,211 --> 00:52:14,600
l don't want to be a pie!

543
00:52:15,011 --> 00:52:16,841
l don't like gravy.

544
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:20,005
Ladies,
let's not lose our heads.

545
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:21,604
Lose our heads?

546
00:52:29,889 --> 00:52:34,279
What l meant was, Rocky sabotaged
the machine and bought us more time.

547
00:52:35,008 --> 00:52:38,284
And better still,
he's going to fly for us tomorrow.

548
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:41,361
Once we see how,
l know we'll get it.

549
00:52:41,768 --> 00:52:46,477
So don't worry. Tomorrow everything
is going to go much smoother.

550
00:52:56,446 --> 00:52:58,596
Alright, Pops,
what did l do now?

551
00:52:59,006 --> 00:53:00,996
A very brave and honorable deed.

552
00:53:03,405 --> 00:53:06,317
ln the light of your action today,

553
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:10,160
l dutifully admit
that l misjudged your character.

554
00:53:11,684 --> 00:53:14,152
l present you
with this medal for bravery.

555
00:53:16,644 --> 00:53:18,793
And l salute you.

556
00:53:22,563 --> 00:53:23,837
ln honor of this occasion,

557
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:26,597
l surrender the bunk entirely.

558
00:53:27,002 --> 00:53:29,914
l shall sleep under the stars.

559
00:53:32,842 --> 00:53:38,473
l await tomorrow's flying
demonstration with great anticipation.

560
00:53:41,201 --> 00:53:43,270
You and me both, Pops.

561
00:53:52,759 --> 00:53:54,875
Oh, were you ...?
- ls this your ...?

562
00:53:55,279 --> 00:53:58,316
Since you're here ...
- l'm glad you're here ...

563
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:01,107
You go first.
- You go ahead.

564
00:54:03,438 --> 00:54:07,431
l just wanted to say, l may have been
a bit harsh at first ...

565
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:10,829
What l really mean is ...

566
00:54:11,397 --> 00:54:12,512
thank you

567
00:54:12,997 --> 00:54:15,067
for saving my life.

568
00:54:15,477 --> 00:54:17,593
For saving our lives.

569
00:54:18,116 --> 00:54:21,426
You know,
l come up here every night

570
00:54:21,836 --> 00:54:25,829
and look at that hill, imagining
what it's like on the other side.

571
00:54:26,476 --> 00:54:28,306
lt's funny ...

572
00:54:28,715 --> 00:54:32,594
l've never actually felt grass
beneath my feet. l'm sorry.

573
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:36,830
l'm rambling on about grass,
and you had something to say.

574
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:42,264
lt's just that ...

575
00:54:42,954 --> 00:54:46,468
life, as l've experienced it,
out there

576
00:54:46,873 --> 00:54:49,182
lone free-ranging and stuff ...

577
00:54:49,673 --> 00:54:52,141
lt's full of disappointments.

578
00:54:52,553 --> 00:54:54,941
So grass isn't all
it's cracked up to be?

579
00:54:55,352 --> 00:54:59,823
Grass! Exactly.
lt's always greener on the other side.

580
00:55:00,232 --> 00:55:02,267
And then you get there,

581
00:55:02,671 --> 00:55:06,220
and it's brown and prickly.
See what l'm saying?

582
00:55:10,231 --> 00:55:12,141
What l'm trying to say is ...

583
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:17,702
you're welcome.

584
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:23,742
You know, that hill is looking closer
tonight than it ever has before.

585
00:55:29,308 --> 00:55:32,106
Good night, Rocky.

586
00:55:33,908 --> 00:55:34,658
Good night,

587
00:55:35,348 --> 00:55:36,700
Ginger.

588
00:55:59,065 --> 00:56:02,614
Company, attention!

589
00:56:07,984 --> 00:56:11,692
Today's the day, girls.
We're going to fly. l can feel it.

590
00:56:13,423 --> 00:56:16,256
Finally, we get to see
a professional in action.

591
00:56:16,663 --> 00:56:18,893
Start warming up. l'll go get him.

592
00:56:19,463 --> 00:56:21,498
Rocky? Knock, knock.

593
00:56:21,902 --> 00:56:24,132
Everyone's waiting, so l told them ...

594
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:12,085
A cannon.

595
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:15,879
That'd give you a thrust.
- l knew he was fake all along.

596
00:58:16,289 --> 00:58:19,565
ln fact, l'm not even sure
if he was American.

597
00:58:21,489 --> 00:58:22,841
What's the next plan?

598
00:58:24,088 --> 00:58:28,525
Face it. The only way we get out
is wrapped in pastry.

599
00:58:29,688 --> 00:58:33,202
Perhaps he just went on holiday.
- Perhaps he left to get away

600
00:58:33,607 --> 00:58:35,802
from your infernal knitting!

601
00:58:38,447 --> 00:58:40,801
You always hit him.
See how you like it.

602
00:58:41,806 --> 00:58:43,603
Don't push me, four-eyes!

603
00:58:45,206 --> 00:58:46,639
Quiet!

604
00:58:47,046 --> 00:58:49,434
Quiet, l say! Dissention

605
00:58:49,845 --> 00:58:53,474
in the ranks. Just what Jerry wants.
The old divide and conquer.

606
00:58:53,885 --> 00:58:55,762
A proper squadron work together,

607
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:58,473
just like we did in my RAF days.

608
00:58:58,884 --> 00:59:02,843
Jocko at the stick, Flappy at the map,
and Whizzbang at the tail-end Charlie.

609
00:59:03,244 --> 00:59:07,077
Wingco would give the call, hop in
the old crate, chocks away!

610
00:59:07,483 --> 00:59:09,599
That's how you get medals!

611
00:59:10,283 --> 00:59:14,640
Will you shut up
about your stupid bloomin' medals!

612
00:59:20,362 --> 00:59:22,398
How dare you!

613
00:59:23,641 --> 00:59:26,439
Forgive me.
As an officer ...

614
00:59:47,639 --> 00:59:50,436
Everyone, shut up!

615
01:00:00,917 --> 01:00:02,794
What exactly is the RAF?

616
01:00:03,637 --> 01:00:04,865
What do you mean?

617
01:00:05,277 --> 01:00:07,744
The Royal Air Force is what.

618
01:00:08,156 --> 01:00:11,068
Then what's the "old crate"?

619
01:00:14,156 --> 01:00:15,714
There she is!

620
01:00:17,515 --> 01:00:21,349
Gorgeous, isn't she? - You mean,
you flew? ln one of these?

621
01:00:21,755 --> 01:00:25,269
Beautifully built. ln fact,
there's a bit of a story there.

622
01:00:25,674 --> 01:00:29,906
We were on a reconnaissance flight,
when the weather duffed up.

623
01:00:30,314 --> 01:00:33,112
Yes ... of course.

624
01:00:33,553 --> 01:00:35,748
We may be able to pull this off.

625
01:00:36,153 --> 01:00:38,747
We're still flying out of here.

626
01:00:39,153 --> 01:00:42,986
Fowler's provided the answer.
- l have?

627
01:00:43,392 --> 01:00:45,348
Oh, yes. Of course l have.

628
01:00:46,672 --> 01:00:47,661
How have l?

629
01:00:48,072 --> 01:00:50,710
We'll make a crate.

630
01:00:51,831 --> 01:00:52,820
Mac,

631
01:00:53,231 --> 01:00:54,823
you'll handle engineering.

632
01:00:55,231 --> 01:00:56,584
Babs, manufacturing.

633
01:00:56,991 --> 01:00:59,107
Fowler is
chief aviation adviser.

634
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:00,784
Bunty, eggs.

635
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,384
Eggs?

636
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:05,258
Right. Like the ones
the rooster was going to lay.

637
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:08,308
Only roosters don't lay eggs, do they?

638
01:01:08,709 --> 01:01:12,782
Don't they? - lt's a lady thing,
apparently. Ask your mum.

639
01:01:13,189 --> 01:01:15,225
One egg per item on the list.

640
01:01:15,629 --> 01:01:19,177
First payment in advance.
- Right. When do we start?

641
01:01:31,427 --> 01:01:32,985
What the dickens?

642
01:01:35,906 --> 01:01:37,578
Oh, gnomes now!

643
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:31,459
Eggs from heaven!
- No, from her bum.

644
01:03:02,096 --> 01:03:03,211
ldiot!

645
01:03:04,056 --> 01:03:06,365
That was close. Too close.

646
01:03:07,456 --> 01:03:11,448
We can't stop now.
Everyone, go for it.

647
01:03:11,735 --> 01:03:12,724
Go, go!

648
01:03:15,815 --> 01:03:17,851
Mac! We need the calculations quick.

649
01:03:18,255 --> 01:03:20,404
Agnes, that has to be really secure.

650
01:03:20,814 --> 01:03:23,009
Careful up there, Fowler!

651
01:03:23,934 --> 01:03:27,165
Bunty, give him a hand.
Well done, Babs. Keep it up!

652
01:03:27,574 --> 01:03:29,803
No problem, dollface.

653
01:04:12,848 --> 01:04:14,042
Ah, boy.

654
01:04:20,407 --> 01:04:21,726
Come on.

655
01:04:24,007 --> 01:04:25,076
Please!

656
01:04:29,726 --> 01:04:30,841
Oh, no.

657
01:04:31,246 --> 01:04:32,361
He's fixed it.

658
01:04:38,285 --> 01:04:40,196
Get the chickens.

659
01:04:40,885 --> 01:04:41,874
Which ones?

660
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,478
All of them!

661
01:04:51,484 --> 01:04:52,473
My tools!

662
01:04:54,964 --> 01:04:56,521
Thieving little buggers.

663
01:04:57,283 --> 01:04:58,921
What's the plan?

664
01:05:02,283 --> 01:05:03,193
Attack!

665
01:05:05,842 --> 01:05:07,070
Nice plan.

666
01:05:16,561 --> 01:05:18,438
The chickens are revolting!

667
01:05:18,841 --> 01:05:21,400
Finally, something we agree on.

668
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:22,789
Help!

669
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:29,918
Under the hut!

670
01:05:37,439 --> 01:05:39,793
What have we done?
- This is it.

671
01:05:40,198 --> 01:05:41,631
We're escaping!

672
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:43,027
What? Now?

673
01:05:43,558 --> 01:05:44,388
Now!

674
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:47,028
But she's not ready.
- Listen!

675
01:05:47,437 --> 01:05:50,474
We either die free chickens
or die trying.

676
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:55,717
Are those the only choices?
- Let's do it!

677
01:05:56,117 --> 01:05:57,231
Scramble!

678
01:06:47,951 --> 01:06:51,067
The exits are located here and here.

679
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:55,179
ln the likely event of an emergency,
put your head between your knees ...

680
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:57,659
... and kiss your bum goodbye.

681
01:06:58,069 --> 01:06:59,821
Okay, Fowler. Ready for takeoff.

682
01:07:00,789 --> 01:07:02,541
Behind you all the way.

683
01:07:04,949 --> 01:07:07,940
You're supposed to be up there.
You're the pilot!

684
01:07:08,468 --> 01:07:11,744
Don't be ridiculous.
l can't fly this contraption.

685
01:07:12,148 --> 01:07:14,786
But back in your day ...
the Royal Air Force.

686
01:07:15,187 --> 01:07:19,499
644 Squadron, poultry division.
We were the mascots.

687
01:07:19,907 --> 01:07:22,057
You mean you never flew the plane?

688
01:07:22,467 --> 01:07:25,424
Good heavens, no. l'm a chicken.

689
01:07:27,386 --> 01:07:31,743
The Royal Air Force doesn't let
chickens fly a complex aircraft!

690
01:07:32,146 --> 01:07:35,296
We're all gonna die.
- Fowler, you have to fly it.

691
01:07:35,705 --> 01:07:37,775
You always talk about
"back in your day."

692
01:07:38,185 --> 01:07:40,141
Well, today is your day.

693
01:07:41,784 --> 01:07:44,662
You can do it, you old sausage.

694
01:07:47,304 --> 01:07:50,420
Wing Commander T.l.Fowler,
reporting for duty.

695
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:58,215
What're you waiting for?
Let's get this crate off the ground!

696
01:07:59,502 --> 01:08:00,901
Fowler, now!

697
01:08:01,302 --> 01:08:03,213
Roger! Contact!

698
01:08:14,941 --> 01:08:16,532
Cleared for takeoff!

699
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:24,812
Chocks away!

700
01:08:34,498 --> 01:08:35,533
Full throttle!

701
01:08:58,696 --> 01:09:00,333
We need more power!

702
01:09:00,735 --> 01:09:02,134
l can't work miracles.

703
01:09:02,535 --> 01:09:04,571
We're givin' her all she's got!

704
01:09:13,214 --> 01:09:14,124
Gotcha!

705
01:09:14,534 --> 01:09:15,808
Hard right!

706
01:09:18,133 --> 01:09:19,691
Oh, mother.

707
01:09:25,253 --> 01:09:27,322
Turn her around.
l'll get the ramp.

708
01:09:40,451 --> 01:09:42,885
Put the ramp down!

709
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:48,398
You are going to be a pie.

710
01:10:20,606 --> 01:10:22,517
Look out!

711
01:10:22,926 --> 01:10:24,120
Clear the runway!

712
01:10:44,843 --> 01:10:45,912
Let's go!

713
01:10:49,843 --> 01:10:51,993
We're flying!

714
01:11:05,401 --> 01:11:06,550
That's for leaving.

715
01:11:08,401 --> 01:11:10,675
And this is for coming back.

716
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,552
Great Scott! What was that?

717
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,233
A cling-on!

718
01:11:19,639 --> 01:11:21,948
The engines can't take it!

719
01:11:25,479 --> 01:11:26,832
My goodness!

720
01:11:27,239 --> 01:11:28,637
Babs! Scissors!

721
01:11:32,678 --> 01:11:35,431
Lower me down.
- But ... - Just do it.

722
01:11:35,838 --> 01:11:37,429
lncrease velocity!

723
01:11:37,837 --> 01:11:41,432
What's that mean?
- Pedal your flippin' giblets out!

724
01:11:54,035 --> 01:11:56,071
Lower!
- l'm trying!

725
01:12:03,274 --> 01:12:04,673
Look out!

726
01:12:23,992 --> 01:12:25,744
Fire! Fire!

727
01:12:28,152 --> 01:12:29,300
My eggs!

728
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:40,664
More ammo! Hurry!

729
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:42,901
We got no more eggs!

730
01:12:43,310 --> 01:12:44,504
Look out!

731
01:12:52,469 --> 01:12:53,743
No!

732
01:13:10,947 --> 01:13:12,175
Bombs away!

733
01:13:12,586 --> 01:13:13,985
Mr. Tweedy!

734
01:13:15,906 --> 01:13:17,862
That was good! That was good!

735
01:13:20,066 --> 01:13:22,499
The old bird bought it!

736
01:13:56,901 --> 01:14:00,496
l told you they was organized.

737
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:13,054
We did it, everyone!

738
01:14:34,937 --> 01:14:37,974
Keep pedaling. We're not there yet.

739
01:14:41,936 --> 01:14:45,008
You can't see paradise
if you don't pedal.

740
01:14:47,456 --> 01:14:49,446
Put your drumsticks into it.

741
01:14:53,495 --> 01:14:58,648
That's what l told them. We were
losing altitude, heading for ...

742
01:14:59,454 --> 01:15:03,413
A lovely holiday.
l'll be sad to go back.

743
01:15:03,814 --> 01:15:06,247
Safety at all times is imperative.

744
01:15:06,653 --> 01:15:09,929
Wind her up and let her go.

745
01:15:10,493 --> 01:15:11,482
So ...

746
01:15:12,413 --> 01:15:14,926
ls it as good as you imagined?
- No.

747
01:15:16,852 --> 01:15:18,570
lt's better.

748
01:15:20,292 --> 01:15:22,248
l'll show you how to play cricket.

749
01:15:27,091 --> 01:15:28,763
Here's a thought.

750
01:15:29,131 --> 01:15:31,804
Let's get an egg
and start our own chicken farm.

751
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:35,486
We'll have all the eggs we can eat.
- Right.

752
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:39,087
We'll need a chicken then.
- No, an egg first.

753
01:15:39,490 --> 01:15:41,844
That's where the chicken comes from.

754
01:15:42,249 --> 01:15:45,047
No. Without the chicken
where do you get the egg?

755
01:15:45,449 --> 01:15:47,883
From a chicken ...
that comes from the egg.

756
01:15:48,289 --> 01:15:50,040
But you need an egg to have a chicken.

757
01:15:50,448 --> 01:15:53,997
You got to get the chicken first
to get the egg.

758
01:15:54,408 --> 01:15:56,080
Then you get the chicken.

759
01:15:56,688 --> 01:15:58,643
Hang on. Let's go over this again.

760
01:19:19,344 --> 01:19:20,538
The egg, obviously.

761
01:19:20,944 --> 01:19:24,698
Rolling along happily, then crack!
lt hatches the first chicken.

762
01:19:25,104 --> 01:19:27,095
But where'd the egg come from?

763
01:19:27,704 --> 01:19:32,731
What do you mean? - Egg comes rolling
along happily and wonders,

764
01:19:33,303 --> 01:19:38,296
where'd it come from without
a chicken? No eggs come rolling along.

765
01:19:38,902 --> 01:19:43,896
Without an egg to hatch the chicken
there'll be no chicken

766
01:19:44,502 --> 01:19:49,495
to lay the first egg. - Have we got
2 eggs now? - No, still the first egg.

767
01:19:50,101 --> 01:19:53,093
What about the first chicken?
- lt's in the very first egg.

768
01:19:53,501 --> 01:19:55,092
Guys!

769
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:58,410
l'm trying to enjoy paradise.

770
01:19:58,780 --> 01:20:01,977
Sorry, guv.
- Won't happen again.

771
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:03,414
Thanks.

772
01:20:04,139 --> 01:20:05,777
Gitface.
- Pillock.

773
01:20:06,379 --> 01:20:09,416
Thinks he's such a big shot,
'cause his name's on a poster.

774
01:20:09,819 --> 01:20:12,491
They're all the same.
- The rats are the stars.

775
01:20:13,098 --> 01:20:17,011
Yes, we do all the hard work,
and he gets all the credit.

776
01:20:17,418 --> 01:20:21,456
He gets everything. - Everything.
- You said it, mate! - l know.
