1
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:22,710
因為我們正處於一個變化與挑戰的時期
For we meet in an hour of change and challenge,

2
00:01:22,712 --> 00:01:25,680
希望與恐懼交織的年代
in a decade of hope and fear,

3
00:01:25,682 --> 00:01:28,983
知識與愚昧並存的時代
in an age of both knowledge and ignorance.

4
00:01:28,985 --> 00:01:34,122
我們獲得的知識越多，我們顯露出的無知也就越多
The greater our knowledge increases, the greater our ignorance unfolds.

5
00:01:34,124 --> 00:01:37,225
因此毫不奇怪
So it is not surprising

6
00:01:37,227 --> 00:01:41,162
有些人想我們再原地踏步多一會
that some would have us stay where we are a little longer

7
00:01:41,164 --> 00:01:43,765
休息下, 等一等
To rest, to wait.

8
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:47,735
但是我們的休斯頓, 我們的德克薩斯
But this city of Houston, this state of Texas,

9
00:01:47,737 --> 00:01:49,837
我們的合眾國
this country of the United States

10
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:52,740
不是由那些解甲歸田
was not built by those who waited and rested

11
00:01:52,742 --> 00:01:54,676
只想回顧過去的人來建設的
and wished to look behind them.

12
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:01,683
我們決定登月
We choose to go to the moon.

13
00:02:01,685 --> 00:02:03,885
我們決定登月
We choose to go to the moon.

14
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:14,128
我們決定在這個年代登月，以及成就其他
We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things,

15
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,232
不是因為它們輕而易舉，而是因為它們困難重重
not because they are easy, but because they are hard.

16
00:02:18,234 --> 00:02:22,770
通過這個演講, 約翰.f.肯尼迪把我們
With this one speech, John f. Kennedy escalated our cold war

17
00:02:22,772 --> 00:02:25,840
和蘇聯的冷戰提升到了外太空
with the Soviet union to outer space.

18
00:02:25,842 --> 00:02:29,310
現在, 如果我們不能在1969年前實現載人登月
Now, if we do not land a man on the moon by 1969,

19
00:02:29,312 --> 00:02:31,879
我們就會讓肯尼迪無法兌現承諾
we will have broken JFK's promise.

20
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:35,850
而在世人的眼裏, 蘇聯將會贏得冷戰的勝利
And in the eyes of the world, the Soviet union will win the cold war.

21
00:02:35,852 --> 00:02:37,785
更加糟糕的是
To make matters even more difficult,

22
00:02:37,787 --> 00:02:39,387
中央情報局已經從一項太空計劃中
the CIA has discovered a leak

23
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:41,823
發現了一個漏洞
coming out of the space program.

24
00:02:41,825 --> 00:02:44,826
絕密的美國研究出現在了蘇聯人的報告中
Top secret American research is showing up in Soviet briefings,

25
00:02:44,828 --> 00:02:50,131
這意味著克格勃已經在NASA內部安插了鼴鼠
which means the KGB has implanted a mole inside NASA.

26
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:54,969
如果俄國人能夠竊取我們的技術, 他們就能在登月這事上擊敗我們
If the Russians are able to steal our technology, they could beat us to the moon.

27
00:02:54,971 --> 00:03:00,808
就像他們在航天上擊敗我們那樣, 他們在1957後首先發射了伴侶號人造衛星
Just as they beat us into space with the sputnik satellite in 1957.

28
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,045
NASA局長, James Webb, 否認存在這個鼴鼠
The director of NASA, James Webb, denies the presence of this mole,

29
00:03:04,047 --> 00:03:07,515
意味著中情局只能暗中安插一支隊伍
which means the CIA must move in a team undercover.

30
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:11,252
我們就是這麼進來的
That's where we come in.

31
00:03:11,254 --> 00:03:14,222
請允許我介紹Owen Williams
Allow me to introduce Owen Williams,

32
00:03:14,224 --> 00:03:17,091
和我自己, Matt Johnson
and myself, Matt Johnson.

33
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:19,427
我們通過光明招募計劃加入了中情局
We joined the CIA through the bright recruits program

34
00:03:19,429 --> 00:03:22,864
從那時到現在都一直是同事
and have been working together ever since.

35
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:27,902
和我倆的攝制組一起, 我們組成了中情局的影視部
Along with our camera team, we make up the CIA's av department.

36
00:03:27,904 --> 00:03:31,005
現在, 我們正在完成深紅行動
Currently, we are finishing operation deep red.

37
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:33,307
一項針對導演Stanley Kubrick(代表作《2001太空漫遊》)的調查
The probe into film director Stanley Kubrick.

38
00:03:33,309 --> 00:03:37,278
但這項任務沒有讓我們充分發揮潛力
But this mission is not using us to our full potential.

39
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,515
我們正在申請調離深紅行動
We are asking to be transferred off of operation deep red,

40
00:03:40,517 --> 00:03:43,017
調去拉鏈行動
and on to operation zipper.

41
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,386
進NASA去尋找那個鼴鼠
The mission into NASA to find the mole.

42
00:03:45,388 --> 00:03:48,156
因為我們的攝影背景, 我們將會...
Because of our filmmaking background, we would make...

43
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:49,524
好, 停
Okay, stop.

44
00:03:49,526 --> 00:03:51,392
停
Stop.

45
00:03:51,394 --> 00:03:52,860
這是要幹啥?
What is this supposed to be?

46
00:03:52,862 --> 00:03:56,030
嗯. 這個...這是個宣傳片
Okay. It's a...It's a pitch film.

47
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,433
它...這個...它是做給拉鏈行動的. 我想...
It... so... it's for operation zipper. I think...

48
00:03:59,435 --> 00:04:01,836
拉鏈行動已經安排好了
Operation zipper's already been assigned.

49
00:04:01,838 --> 00:04:03,137
我們知道
We know it has.

50
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:05,139
我覺得局裏搞錯了
I think the agency is making a mistake

51
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:07,275
派了個科學家去NASA
with sending a scientist into NASA.

52
00:04:07,277 --> 00:04:09,877
嗯, 你的觀點沒個卵用
Well, your opinion means nothing.

53
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:12,013
是的, 好吧. 只是...只是...
Yeah, okay. Just... just...

54
00:04:12,015 --> 00:04:14,081
如果你看完剩下的電影, 你會看到... 我已經看得夠多了
If you watch the rest of this film, you'll see... I've seen enough.

55
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:17,185
但是我們有個找出間諜的絕妙計劃. 我保證你
But we have an amazing plan for finding the spy. I'm sure you do.

56
00:04:17,187 --> 00:04:20,388
Boles, 我們在這上頭很努力. 你真的不把剩下的看完?
Boles, we worked hard on this. You're seriously not going to watch the rest of this?

57
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,056
嗯. 我們能不能把這個拿給Brackett看?
No. Can we show it to Brackett?

58
00:04:22,058 --> 00:04:23,157
不
No.

59
00:04:26,094 --> 00:04:28,963
好吧
Okay.

60
00:04:28,965 --> 00:04:30,932
這事有點冒險
This was a long shot.

61
00:04:30,934 --> 00:04:33,568
我們入職才一年
We've only been here for one year.

62
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,070
以後我們會參加很多類似的行動
We'll get on missions like this in the future.

63
00:04:38,574 --> 00:04:40,975
我覺得這會管用
I thought this was going to work.

64
00:04:40,977 --> 00:04:44,879
你知道這並不是個難得的機會. 嗯, 你應該...
You knew that it wasn't a great chance. Yeah, you should...

65
00:04:44,881 --> 00:04:46,314
Jared, 你怎麼還在拍
Jared, you should have cut when

66
00:04:46,316 --> 00:04:47,849
你看見了, 這事不順
you saw it wasn't going good.

67
00:04:47,851 --> 00:04:49,584
你本應該這麼來拍...
You're supposed to be filming so that...

68
00:04:49,586 --> 00:04:52,420
我都沒注意到
I didn't even notice.

69
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:54,388
嗯. 嗨
Yeah. Hey.

70
00:04:58,994 --> 00:05:01,462
好. 我有個主意
Okay, I got an idea.

71
00:05:01,464 --> 00:05:05,132
我們派去的人, 應該看起來完全沒搞清狀況
We need to send someone who will look like they have no idea what's going on.

72
00:05:05,134 --> 00:05:08,135
我們, 作為記錄片攝制組
Us, as a documentary film crew.

73
00:05:08,137 --> 00:05:11,372
我們可以假裝我們來自國家教育...好, 我們得走了
We can pretend we are from the national education... Okay, we have to go.

74
00:05:11,374 --> 00:05:12,473
我們走
We got to go.

75
00:05:12,475 --> 00:05:14,909
這是不是個好主意?
Is this a good idea?

76
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:17,311
Andy? 它是個好...嗨, 它是個好主意
Andy? It's a good... Hey. It's a good idea.

77
00:05:17,313 --> 00:05:20,214
你準備好了? 他們要是把我們開除了怎麼辦?
Are you ready? What if they fire us?

78
00:05:20,216 --> 00:05:22,550
你第一句說啥?
What's your first line?

79
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:26,287
哦, 額, 你們的計劃是派遣... 好, 我沒事
Oh, uh, your plan is to send...Okay, I'm fine.

80
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:29,223
好. 走
Okay. Let's go.

81
00:05:39,601 --> 00:05:41,402
人都到齊了?
Everyone here?

82
00:05:41,404 --> 00:05:43,070
Boles...
Boles...

83
00:05:43,072 --> 00:05:44,972
繼續. 謝謝
Carry on. Thank you.

84
00:05:44,974 --> 00:05:46,941
各位早上好
Good morning, everyone.

85
00:05:51,381 --> 00:05:55,416
大家好, 我是特工Matt Johnson. 你們下面看到的是
Hello, my name is special agent Matt Johnson, and what you're about to watch

86
00:05:55,418 --> 00:05:58,152
一部詳細闡述導演Stanley Kubrick和電影《奇愛博士》
is a film detailing the connections between Stanley Kubrick

87
00:05:58,154 --> 00:06:02,089
之間關係的影片
and the film Dr. Strangelove or how I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb.

88
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:05,059
結論, Stanley Kubrick不是間諜
Conclusion, Stanley Kubrick is not a spy.

89
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:14,402
謝謝
Thank you.

90
00:06:14,404 --> 00:06:16,337
有人提問嗎?
Are there any questions?

91
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:22,376
好的. 下一個是什麼?
That covers it. Uh, what's next?

92
00:06:22,378 --> 00:06:26,547
事實上, Brackett總監, 對於下一個拉鏈行動的主要研究
Actually, director Brackett, I'd like to make a pitch for

93
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:31,018
我想做個保證
major research to be moved onto operation zipper next.

94
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,187
你們在搞什麼鬼?
What the hell are you doing?

95
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,426
你們想安排一個...
You guys are trying to put a...

96
00:06:38,428 --> 00:06:42,363
外勤特工進入NASA. 裝扮成科學家, 然而...
Field agent inside NASA posing as a scientist, and...

97
00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:45,633
Williams特工和我覺得這辦法行不通
Agent Williams and I don't think it will work.

98
00:06:45,635 --> 00:06:48,336
這個鼴鼠, 如果存在的話,
This mole, if he's there,

99
00:06:48,338 --> 00:06:51,472
可能從60年代初開始就已經在NASA了
could have been at NASA since the early 60s.

100
00:06:51,474 --> 00:06:56,243
他一眼就能認出火箭科學家是我們的人假扮的
He's going to spot one of our guys pretending to be a rocket scientist instantly.

101
00:06:56,245 --> 00:06:58,245
我們得派些人
We need to send people

102
00:06:58,247 --> 00:07:00,982
看起來完全不知道發生了什麼事情
who are going to look like they have no idea what's going on.

103
00:07:00,984 --> 00:07:02,249
我們
Us.

104
00:07:02,251 --> 00:07:04,285
作為記錄片攝制組
As a documentary film crew.

105
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:07,021
我們可以假裝我們來自國家教育電視網
We can pretend that we're from the national education television network,

106
00:07:07,023 --> 00:07:10,057
拍攝阿波羅記錄片
filming the definitive Apollo documentary.

107
00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:13,627
我們去那記錄登月比賽. - 好主意
We're there to chart the race to the moon. Smart idea.

108
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:17,999
但蘇聯鼴鼠不會讓人公開拍攝他們
But no Soviet mole's gonna let anyone openly film 'em.

109
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:21,502
嗯, Brackett總監, 我們現在就正在窗戶外頭拍你
Well, director Brackett, we're filming you right now through the window.

110
00:07:31,113 --> 00:07:35,249
不過你們得給我們買更好的攝像機
You're going to have to buy us better cameras, though.

111
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:37,251
老天爺
Jesus Christ.

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
拉鏈行動

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
國家教育電視台攝影: Andrew Appelle

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
國家教育電視台攝影: Jared Raab

115
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
國家教育電視台製片: Owen Williams

116
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,500
國家教育電視台導演: Matt Johnson

117
00:08:54,096 --> 00:08:56,097
好, 我們走
Okay, here we go.

118
00:08:56,099 --> 00:08:58,232
但願不會被他們識破
Let's hope they buy this.

119
00:08:58,234 --> 00:09:00,701
好了?
Ready?

120
00:09:00,703 --> 00:09:03,604
哇!
Whoa!

121
00:09:03,606 --> 00:09:05,506
- Hi! Hi!
- Hi! Hi!

122
00:09:05,508 --> 00:09:07,108
等我們拿下東西
Just let us get our stuff.

123
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,342
好, 好!
Yeah, yeah!

124
00:09:09,511 --> 00:09:11,112
要幫忙嗎, 安迪?
You need help, Andy?

125
00:09:11,114 --> 00:09:12,746
我們拍這個沒問題吧?
Do you mind if we film this?

126
00:09:12,748 --> 00:09:14,482
嗯, 能有啥問題
Yeah, why not.

127
00:09:14,484 --> 00:09:17,885
這邊, 大廳盡頭右轉...
Here, at the end of the hall on the right...

128
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:19,520
哦, 夥計
Oh, man.

129
00:09:19,522 --> 00:09:21,489
這是任務控制室?
That's mission control?

130
00:09:21,491 --> 00:09:23,591
嗯. 其實晚點我們會進去的
Yeah, actually. We'll have to get in there later.

131
00:09:23,593 --> 00:09:24,692
嗯
Hmm.

132
00:09:24,694 --> 00:09:26,260
Hi
Hi.

133
00:09:26,262 --> 00:09:27,862
我們是記錄片攝像組
We're a documentary film crew.

134
00:09:27,864 --> 00:09:29,797
我們是記錄片攝像組

Jared, make sure you're getting this crisp and in focus,

136
00:09:32,135 --> 00:09:35,703
我可不想編輯跑焦的片子, 拜託
I don't want to have to edit together out of focus stuff, please.

你們還需要些啥?
You guys don't need anything else?

00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:48,282
不用了. 要的話我們會來找你. 我們要先準備一下
No, uh, we'll come find you if we do. We'll just get set up.

She bought it. We're a documentary film crew.

146
00:09:54,223 --> 00:09:56,524
看見沒有他們怎麼看我們? 怎麼看攝像機?
You see how they look at us? See how they look in the cameras?

147
00:09:56,526 --> 00:09:58,592
耶
Yeah.

148
00:09:58,594 --> 00:10:00,761
這是我這輩子參加的最棒的任務
This is the best mission I've ever been on in my life.

額, 這位是Jared
And, uh, this is Jared.

00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:09,537
他們在拍攝一部記錄片, 關於阿波羅任務
They're filming a documentary about the, uh... The Apollo mission.

153
00:10:10,872 --> 00:10:12,873
哦, 好啊
Oh, okay!

154
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,410
那個, 基本上我們會問你做什麼, 以及...當然!
So, we basically are asking about what you do, and... Sure!

155
00:10:16,412 --> 00:10:18,546
我準備好了. 好
And... and I'm ready. Yeah. Okay.

156
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:20,681
嗯, 我在這公共事務辦公室工作
Well, I work here in the public affairs office,

157
00:10:20,683 --> 00:10:22,750
我的其中一項職責是
and one of my duties is

158
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:26,387
媒體產品, 特別是照片
the media products, specifically still photos.

159
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:34,828
我在舒格蘭的劇院裏站起來, 我說
And I stood up in the theater in sugar land and I said,

160
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,632
"別吃那些肉丸! 他沒洗過手."
"don't eat those meatballs! He did not wash his hands."

161
00:10:38,634 --> 00:10:39,767
我必須...
I had to...

162
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,212
謝謝你的時間. 在我們登月之前回來看我們, 好不好?
I appreciate your time. Before we launch to the moon, come back and see us, okay?

163
00:10:51,214 --> 00:10:52,713
我會的. 好.
I will. Okay.

164
00:10:52,715 --> 00:10:54,582
謝謝. 這是個秘密. 我們知道了
Thanks, guys. That's a wrap. We got it.

165
00:10:54,584 --> 00:10:56,650
好的. 記下來
All right, and mark it.

166
00:10:56,652 --> 00:10:58,586
- 採訪Milt. - 第一遍

謝謝你, Owen
Thanks, Owen.

168
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,558
好, 我想你首先可以告訴我們你的名字
So, I guess you can start just by telling us your name.

169
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,427
Milt Heflin.
Milt Heflin.

170
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:09,263
你在NASA這裏做什麼?
And what is it you do here at NASA?

171
00:11:09,265 --> 00:11:11,232
啊. 額...
Huh. Uh...

172
00:11:12,234 --> 00:11:13,801
好
Okay.

173
00:11:17,305 --> 00:11:18,939
把門關上
Shut the door.

174
00:11:31,453 --> 00:11:34,622
各位, 我們能不能拍個休息室一片繁忙的鏡頭?
Guys, can we get a shot of just the lounge being busy?

175
00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:36,890
我知道你們都正工作, 不過如果你們想...
I know you're all working, but if you want to just...

176
00:11:36,892 --> 00:11:39,860
忙忙碌碌, 就像有什麼活動.
Busy, like there's some activity.

177
00:11:39,862 --> 00:11:42,796
或者, 怎麼自然怎麼來
Or, do whatever feels natural.

178
00:11:42,798 --> 00:11:45,032
好 開拍
And action.

179
00:11:45,034 --> 00:11:48,802
不, 別看鏡頭. 坐好就行. 在那站著就行
No, don't look at the cameras. Just keep sitting. Just keep standing there.

180
00:12:04,853 --> 00:12:07,821
佐藤榮作首相的部份東南亞...
Part of Sato's controversial south-east Asia...

181
00:12:07,823 --> 00:12:09,990
北越人
the north Vietnamese

182
00:12:09,992 --> 00:12:12,393
決定接受我們提供的...
decides to accept us offers...

183
00:12:12,395 --> 00:12:15,863
蔓延600英尺成為一片巨大的火海
spread over 600 feet to become a gigantic pool of flames

184
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:20,668
一個叫做紫K的滅火器, 飛機上三次悲劇性的火災
a fire extinguisher called purple k, three tragic fires aboard aircraft...

185
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,771
稍等, Webb先生. 準備好沒有?
One second, Mr. Webb. We're good?

186
00:12:23,773 --> 00:12:26,307
Webb先生, 告訴我, 他們說俄國人在太空競賽中領先
Mr. Webb, tell me, what does it mean

187
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:28,976
那是什麼意思?
when people say the Russians are ahead of us in the space race?

188
00:12:28,978 --> 00:12:31,612
這個, 我覺得他的意思是
Well, I think it means that the job of

189
00:12:31,614 --> 00:12:33,514
讓一些東西在沒有大氣層的
landing something on the moon

190
00:12:33,516 --> 00:12:35,416
月球上著陸
where there's no atmosphere,

191
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:37,484
而且使用火箭來減速而不是加速
and using a rocket to slow it up,

192
00:12:37,486 --> 00:12:38,952
而且還得讓設備正常工作
and having the equipment still work

193
00:12:38,954 --> 00:12:41,422
這是件難度很大的事情
is a very difficult job.

194
00:12:41,424 --> 00:12:44,725
額, 我覺得他的意思是俄國人也還在嘗試, 跟我們一樣...
Uh, I think it means the Russians are trying, just like we are...

195
00:12:45,694 --> 00:12:47,995
這人的辦公室在哪?
Where's this guy's office?

196
00:12:47,997 --> 00:12:49,863
但我覺得真正的意思是...
But I think the real meaning is...

197
00:12:53,835 --> 00:12:58,772
再來兩片
Two more pieces.

198
00:12:58,774 --> 00:13:01,942
-加油, Jared. - 好了, 好了!
- Come on, Jared. - Got it, got it!

199
00:13:01,944 --> 00:13:03,877
好了, 等等
Okay, hold on.

200
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,479
我沒事, 開下燈
I'm fine, I need light.

201
00:13:13,588 --> 00:13:15,723
好了?
Ready?

202
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:18,726
試音, 試音, 試音, 試音...
Test, test, test, test...

203
00:13:18,728 --> 00:13:21,995
那你必須說清楚怎麼推進這事. 怎麼做
then you get to talk about how to go forward. To do it.

204
00:13:21,997 --> 00:13:24,765
嗯, 我沒啥興趣
Uh, I am not much interested,

205
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:28,635
而且我認為討論技術交換這事不太現實
and I don't think it's very realistic to talk about technological interchange,

206
00:13:28,637 --> 00:13:31,505
而且這種事情, 你首先得從最基礎開始做起
and this kind of thing. You first gotta get on the basis

207
00:13:31,507 --> 00:13:32,673
就是...就是...
where... where...

208
00:13:32,675 --> 00:13:34,141
好, 那個...
Okay, so...

209
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:36,443
他辦公室電話響的時候
His phone rings, in his office,

210
00:13:36,445 --> 00:13:38,479
這個電話也會同時響
and this phone rings at the same time.

211
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:41,648
只要我們錄下來
As long as we're rolling

212
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,718
他一接電話, 我們就啥都有了
when he picks up, we get everything.

213
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,020
我找了個房子. 很漂亮, 紅色的
I found us a house. It's beautiful, it's red,

214
00:13:47,022 --> 00:13:49,590
帶苗圃和院子. 你會喜歡的
it has a nursery and a yard. You'll love it.

215
00:13:49,592 --> 00:13:51,492
床有多大?
How big is the bed?

216
00:13:51,494 --> 00:13:52,726
是大床
It's a queen.

217
00:13:53,862 --> 00:13:58,665
你現在是一個人嗎?
Are you alone right now?

218
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:01,135
不, 我在上班. 你在幹啥?
No, I'm at work. What are you doing?

219
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:03,771
想不想知道我穿的啥?
Do you want to know what I'm wearing?

220
00:14:03,773 --> 00:14:06,039
Julie, 我現在沒空做這個. 我在辦公室
Julie, I can't do this right now. I'm at the office.

221
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,742
抱歉, 晚點吧
I'm sorry, maybe later.

222
00:14:08,744 --> 00:14:13,814
嗯, 人家戴的是粉色文胸, 還有你買的黑色裙子
Well, I'm wearing a pink bra and that black skirt you bought me.

223
00:14:13,816 --> 00:14:17,584
寶貝, Matt就在我旁邊. 我在上班. 我晚上打給你好不好?
Honey, Matt is right beside me and I'm at work. Can I call you tonight?

224
00:14:17,586 --> 00:14:19,953
現在我把裙子脫了
I'm taking off the skirt now.

225
00:14:21,724 --> 00:14:23,924
裏面啥也沒穿呢. 哇!
There's nothing underneath. Whoa!

226
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:27,861
你在幹嘛? 沒事
What are you doing? Nothing.

227
00:14:27,863 --> 00:14:30,531
我想和你一起玩
I'm trying to have fun with you.

228
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:33,200
稍等, 等等...不!
Wait a second, hold on... No!

229
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:35,002
這是啥
What is it?

230
00:14:35,004 --> 00:14:37,538
我們啥也沒幹. 我在上班
We're not doing anything. I'm doing work.

231
00:14:38,807 --> 00:14:40,808
喂?
Hello?

232
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,144
不要啊
Don't do that.

233
00:14:44,146 --> 00:14:47,214
你在電話裏找到啥?
What'd you find in that phone?

234
00:14:47,216 --> 00:14:49,817
啥? 啥? 天吶
What? What? Oh, my god.

235
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:52,019
我們被竊聽了
We've been bugged.

236
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:53,954
我們被竊聽了, 各位. 我們被竊聽了
We've been bugged, guys. We've been bugged.

237
00:14:53,956 --> 00:14:55,155
不, 不, 不!
No, no, no!

238
00:14:55,157 --> 00:14:57,858
還有啥? 還是就這了? Owen?
Anything else, or is that it? Owen?

239
00:14:58,827 --> 00:15:00,994
從車裏就搬這些了?
That's it from this car?

240
00:15:00,996 --> 00:15:03,797
喂
Guys?

241
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:08,902
對不起了!
I said I was sorry!

242
00:15:08,904 --> 00:15:10,637
你的帽子?
Your hat?

243
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:24,551
- 這還有幾個箱子. - 這都不是事兒
- A couple more boxes here. - These are not a big deal.

244
00:15:28,957 --> 00:15:32,759
請不要碰我
Please don't touch me.

245
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:36,163
剩下的我來拿!
I'll get the rest!

246
00:16:06,694 --> 00:16:10,731
我們都, 額, 已經碰到過, 還會繼續碰到緊急情況,
We both, uh, have had and will have emergencies,

247
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:14,935
而且, 嗯, 每一次飛行, 都存在極高風險的因素,
and, uh, that each flight, uh, has some element of extreme risk,

248
00:16:14,937 --> 00:16:16,970
其中的部分因素...
and some elements of...

249
00:16:16,972 --> 00:16:19,239
我代表我自己發表這個聲明, 是基於我的學識,
I made this statement on my own, from my knowledge,

250
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:22,709
嗯, 長期的學識...
uh, longstanding knowledge...

251
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,567
會讓我們推遲四年...
setting us back four years...

252
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:48,235
嗯...
Well...

253
00:16:48,237 --> 00:16:50,637
啊...
Uh...

254
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,106
燃燒300秒降到月球表面
300 second burn to the lunar surface...

255
00:16:54,108 --> 00:16:56,109
這啥也不是
This is nothing.

256
00:16:56,111 --> 00:16:57,811
等會. 我們最多只能做到250秒?
Give it a second. 250 seconds is all we can do?

257
00:16:57,813 --> 00:16:59,780
那是最大值
That's the maximum.

258
00:16:59,782 --> 00:17:02,282
- 你知不知道... - 你有沒和TRW討論過?
- And you know that... - Did you talk to TRW?

259
00:17:02,284 --> 00:17:04,985
-另一個聲音是誰? - 不知道
- Who's the other voice? - I dunno.

260
00:17:04,987 --> 00:17:06,787
他們的燃料
Their fuels.

261
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:08,355
我們被Grumman坑死了
Grumman has fucked us.

262
00:17:08,357 --> 00:17:11,925
他們做了個著不了陸的著陸器
They built a lander that can't land.

263
00:17:11,927 --> 00:17:14,127
所以, 我們會拖後...
So, we are going back...

264
00:17:14,129 --> 00:17:15,629
和誰?
With whom?

265
00:17:15,631 --> 00:17:17,631
這會讓我們推後四年
This is setting us back four years.

266
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:20,801
嗯, 我同意. 這個必須得改.
Well, I agree. This is going to have to change.

267
00:17:20,803 --> 00:17:22,903
改? 我們登不了月
Change? We can't land on the moon.

268
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:25,939
除非有奇跡讓Braun找到更輕的燃料
Unless by some miracle Braun finds lighter fuel,

269
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:28,141
否則五年內我們都沒法著陸
we aren't touching down for five years.

270
00:17:28,143 --> 00:17:31,244
好吧...我們只會永遠在上頭繞著月亮轉
Okay... We're just going to be circling forever up there.

271
00:17:31,246 --> 00:17:33,347
那我們跟所有人怎麼說?
So what are we telling everyone?

272
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:35,082
- 啥也不說. - 我們不告訴任何人...
- Nothing. - We don't tell anyone...

273
00:17:36,652 --> 00:17:38,385
你聽懂沒有?
Do you understand what this means?

274
00:17:38,387 --> 00:17:40,754
NASA做不到
NASA can't do it.

275
00:17:40,756 --> 00:17:42,623
他們沒法送人上去再帶回來
They can't land man and come back.

276
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,057
你給Brackett打電話沒有?
Have you called Brackett?

277
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:46,093
當然沒有. 我得先告訴你們
Of course not! I needed to tell you guys first.

278
00:17:46,095 --> 00:17:47,995
我們必須告訴Brackett. 我們必須現在就告訴Brackett.
We have to tell Brackett. We have to tell Brackett right away.

279
00:17:47,997 --> 00:17:49,896
這事你得馬上報告. 我們需要幫助
This is something you report right away. We need help.

280
00:17:49,898 --> 00:17:52,966
我們必須... 放鬆, 沒事. 嗯, 嗯
We have to... Relax, it's okay. Yes. Yes.

281
00:17:52,968 --> 00:17:54,334
我們需要... 我會告訴你怎麼做的, 好嗎?
And we need... I'll tell you what to do, okay?

282
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:56,036
我會告訴你怎麼做
I'm gonna tell you what to do.

283
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:57,971
找出來電話上另外那個人是誰, 好嗎?
Find out who that other guy on the phone was, okay?

284
00:17:57,973 --> 00:18:00,040
因為, 如果我們能在一個月內查出來,
Because, if we found this out in a month,

285
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:02,676
你TMD必須相信那個鼴鼠也能做到
you better fucking believe that the mole can do the same thing.

286
00:18:02,678 --> 00:18:04,745
現在突然一下俄國人知道我們登不了月了
And now all of a sudden the Russians know we can't make it to the moon,

287
00:18:04,747 --> 00:18:06,313
那TMD我們該怎麼做?
then what the fuck are we going to do?

288
00:18:06,315 --> 00:18:08,315
好. 好. 好.
Okay. Okay. Okay.

289
00:18:08,317 --> 00:18:11,118
你給蘭利(中情局總部所在地)打電話
You call Langley.

290
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,786
通了
It's ringing.

291
00:18:14,723 --> 00:18:18,158
你覺得我會和總統通話? 不
You think I'll get to talk to the president? No.

292
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,327
這不是不現實
That's not unrealistic.

293
00:18:20,329 --> 00:18:22,029
我可以. 他可能會, "我們必須馬上找總統"
I could. He could be like, "we need to get this right to the president."

294
00:18:22,031 --> 00:18:23,830
我可能會, "好的, 頭,
I'll be like, "all right.

295
00:18:23,832 --> 00:18:25,312
"告訴我他家電話. 我會..."
"Give me his home phone, sir. I'll..."

296
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:28,835
喂?
Hello?

297
00:18:28,837 --> 00:18:30,237
Brackett總監, 這是Johnson特工從休斯頓打電話
Director Brackett, it's agent Johnson calling from Houston.

298
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:31,672
我們有重大新聞
We have big news.

299
00:18:31,674 --> 00:18:33,373
是什麼?
What's that?

300
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,709
他們登不了月
They can't make it to the moon.

301
00:18:35,711 --> 00:18:37,277
我們截聽到了一個電話
We intercepted a call

302
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:39,780
從James Webb (NASA局長)那
from James Webb.

303
00:18:39,782 --> 00:18:42,315
就我所知, 他們能繞月飛行
From what I understand, they can circle the moon,

304
00:18:42,317 --> 00:18:44,117
但他們沒辦法實際著陸
but they can't actually land.

305
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:46,286
他們...他們沒這個技術
They... they don't have the technology to do it.

306
00:18:46,288 --> 00:18:48,722
他們說最快也要到1971年
They're saying 1971 at the earliest.

307
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:51,425
該死的
Damn it.

308
00:18:51,427 --> 00:18:54,895
等我一會
Give me a minute.

309
00:18:54,897 --> 00:18:57,064
好, 其他還有誰知道這事?
Okay, who else knows about this?

310
00:18:57,066 --> 00:18:59,099
嗯, 沒人, 就...就...
Uh, nobody, from...From...

311
00:18:59,101 --> 00:19:00,400
就我們所知
From what we can tell.

312
00:19:00,402 --> 00:19:02,736
他們在電話上討論這事
They're talking about it on the phone

313
00:19:02,738 --> 00:19:05,472
好像是個大秘密. 好像他們以前從沒討論過
like it was a big secret. Like they've never talked about it before.

314
00:19:05,474 --> 00:19:07,841
嗯, 好
Okay, good.

315
00:19:07,843 --> 00:19:10,010
另一個組要接管拉鏈行動
Another unit is going to take over zipper.

316
00:19:10,012 --> 00:19:11,745
把你的隊伍撤出來
Get your team out of there.

317
00:19:11,747 --> 00:19:15,282
啊...你覺得這有點, 啊
Uh... you think maybe that's a bit, uh,

318
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:17,284
有點短視嗎?
shortsighted in a way?

319
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:20,020
我們已經秘密在這了? 什麼...為什麼?
Seeing as we're here undercover now? What... why?

320
00:19:20,022 --> 00:19:22,956
不要置疑我的命令, 小伙子
Don't question my orders, kid.

321
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,958
我沒有... 我不是要置疑. 我...
I'm not... I don't mean to question it. I...

322
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,228
我只是... 我只是覺得我們在這
I just... I simply think that we're here

323
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,798
而且我...我們必須想出該怎麼應對這事
and I... We have to figure out a response to this,

324
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,234
但是, 你要求我們...
somehow, and you've got us...

325
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:40,474
回家了我們
We're going home.

326
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
電影《月球旅行記》片段

327
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
導演喬治·梅裏愛1902年作品

328
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,500
被稱為「史上第一部科幻片」

329
00:21:47,368 --> 00:21:50,637
只要我們倆有人在說話, 你就拍. 我不管你拍掉多少膠片
If either of us are talking, shoot. I don't care how much film you burn,

330
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:52,472
沒事, 知道不? 這會救我們的命
it doesn't matter. Okay? It's going to save us.

331
00:21:52,474 --> 00:21:53,940
我們在這幹啥?
What are we doing in here?

332
00:21:53,942 --> 00:21:55,308
坐下. 聽這個, 好吧
Sit down, just listen to this, okay?

333
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,143
那個...
Well...

334
00:21:57,145 --> 00:21:59,946
等會...昨晚你有沒給Brackett打電話?
Hold on a sec... Did you call Brackett last night?

335
00:21:59,948 --> 00:22:01,481
打了, 好沒有? 他怎麼說?
Yes, all right? What did he say?

336
00:22:01,483 --> 00:22:03,516
好, 打開它
Okay, turn this on.

337
00:22:03,518 --> 00:22:05,886
他們怎麼說?
What did they say?

338
00:22:05,888 --> 00:22:08,221
我會告訴你他們說了啥的
I'm gonna tell you what they said.

339
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,125
好, 打開了
Okay, it's on.

340
00:22:13,495 --> 00:22:14,995
嗯, 你聽到沒有?
Okay, you hear that?

341
00:22:14,997 --> 00:22:18,531
嗯
Yeah.

342
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:21,668
- 聽出來沒有? - 嗯
- You recognize it? - Yeah.

343
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,403
是伴侶號(蘇聯發射的人類首顆人造衛星)
It's sputnik.

344
00:22:23,405 --> 00:22:25,071
知道嗎? 你比我領先
You know what? You're ahead of me.

345
00:22:25,073 --> 00:22:26,406
嗯, 是. 那是伴侶號
Okay, yeah. It's sputnik.

346
00:22:26,408 --> 00:22:28,341
你怎麼知道它是伴侶號?
How do you know it's sputnik?

347
00:22:28,343 --> 00:22:31,278
你能不能...你昨晚在這睡的?
Can you... did you sleep here last night?

348
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,614
它沒插入任何東西
That's not plugged into anything.

349
00:22:34,616 --> 00:22:37,183
它...它只是在另一邊有個旋鈕. 它不是真的伴侶號
It's... it's just a dial on the other side. It's not actually sputnik.

350
00:22:37,185 --> 00:22:38,618
它只是讓你以為它是
It's just making you think that it is.

351
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,587
它只是在隨機地嗶嗶響
It's just a random beeping.

352
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:42,455
因為你覺得那應該是伴侶號
And because you think that that's supposed to be sputnik,

353
00:22:42,457 --> 00:22:44,090
所以你就相信它是伴侶號
that's why you believe it's sputnik.

354
00:22:44,092 --> 00:22:47,427
登月我們就準備這麼干
This is what we are going to do with the moon.

355
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:48,962
我給Brackett打過電話了,
I called Brackett,

356
00:22:48,964 --> 00:22:51,631
告訴他'69年他們登不了月
told him that they can't make it for '69.

357
00:22:51,633 --> 00:22:54,701
你說, "好, 那, 你們必須想個解決辦法"
He said, "okay, well, you've got to figure out a way to fix it."

358
00:22:54,703 --> 00:22:58,238
我說, "我們可以自己來
And I said, "we can do it on our own.

359
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,175
"我們可以拍個電影來表現我們在登月
"We can make a film that shows us going to the moon

360
00:23:02,177 --> 00:23:04,411
"而不用真的登月"
"without actually doing it."

361
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,281
我們知道他們能飛去那
We know that they can make it up there.

362
00:23:08,283 --> 00:23:10,984
我們不是...我們只在最後一段造假
We're not... we're faking the last little piece.

363
00:23:10,986 --> 00:23:13,620
那一點點...一點點他們做不到的事情
The tiny... The tiny thing they can't do.

364
00:23:13,622 --> 00:23:15,155
著陸和回來
Land and come back.

365
00:23:15,157 --> 00:23:16,957
肯尼迪說我們要做的事情
The thing JFK said we'd do.

366
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:18,491
就只那一部份
That's the only part.

367
00:23:18,493 --> 00:23:20,994
其他全部都是真的, 你明不明白?
Everything else is real, do you understand?

368
00:23:20,996 --> 00:23:22,395
是的, 我懂你的意思
Yeah, I understand what you're saying.

369
00:23:22,397 --> 00:23:23,663
我懂聽起來就像...
And I understand that it sounds like...

370
00:23:23,665 --> 00:23:25,231
看這個, Brackett寄來的
Read this, it's from Brackett.

371
00:23:25,233 --> 00:23:27,133
他寄了個報告? 是的
He sent a briefing? Yes.

372
00:23:33,507 --> 00:23:35,542
如果我們能把這個拿開,
If we can pull this off,

373
00:23:35,544 --> 00:23:38,645
我們就會看起來像天才一樣
we are going to look like geniuses.

374
00:23:38,647 --> 00:23:42,215
NASA裏頭的四個人想出了怎麼
Four guys inside of NASA figure out how to

375
00:23:42,217 --> 00:23:44,417
讓它看起來像是我們登了月. 我們成功了
make it look like we went to the moon. We did it.

376
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:46,519
太瘋狂了!
That's crazy!

377
00:23:46,521 --> 00:23:49,089
我們一直在等的就是這個
This is exactly what we've been waiting for.

378
00:23:49,091 --> 00:23:51,157
天上掉餡餅
It literally fell on our lap.

379
00:23:53,094 --> 00:23:57,030
事成之後我們就能有自己的部門了
We could run our own department after something like this.

380
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,000
《雪崩行動》

381
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,500
翻譯: bob dong

382
00:24:39,273 --> 00:24:41,608
還會不會有更多消息?
Is there more information coming?

383
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:44,144
關於什麼?
About what?

384
00:24:44,146 --> 00:24:47,247
嗯, 目標和預算
Well, the objectives and the budget.

385
00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:49,482
為什麼?
Why?

386
00:24:49,484 --> 00:24:51,651
你不覺得它不完整麼?
This doesn't seem incomplete to you?

387
00:24:51,653 --> 00:24:54,320
不完整? 怎麼? 什麼意思?
Incomplete? How? What do you mean?

388
00:24:54,322 --> 00:24:56,256
嗯, 我...好...
Well, I...Okay...

389
00:24:56,258 --> 00:24:58,291
知道不, 別...別擔心這個
You know what, don't... Don't worry about this.

390
00:24:58,293 --> 00:25:01,194
他們顯然只告訴我們該我們知道的東西
They obviously told us exactly what they want us to hear,

391
00:25:01,196 --> 00:25:03,696
所以我們的任務是拍一個測試, 就這樣
so our job is to film a test, and that's it.

392
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:08,668
走
Come on.

393
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:13,640
沒有...你心裏一點都不愧疚麼?
Does it... you don't have an ethical problem with this at all?

394
00:25:13,642 --> 00:25:16,342
從哪方面?
In what way?

395
00:25:16,344 --> 00:25:19,179
這是在撒謊
In that this is lying.

396
00:25:19,181 --> 00:25:21,314
知道嗎, 這就跟那些善意的謊話一樣
You know what, this is like one of those good lies.

397
00:25:21,316 --> 00:25:23,483
就像聖誕老人和復活節兔
Like Santa Claus and the Easter bunny.

398
00:25:23,485 --> 00:25:25,652
好多小孩都瘋狂著迷
A lot of kids get really mad about those.

399
00:25:29,524 --> 00:25:32,125
我們按每秒48幀來拍
So we're shooting this at 48 frames a second,

400
00:25:32,127 --> 00:25:34,160
你要這麼來動...
so you're going to have to move like...

401
00:25:34,162 --> 00:25:35,862
就像你被拎起來了...
Like you're being lifted up...

402
00:25:35,864 --> 00:25:38,431
好嗎? 像這樣... 這東西有100斤重
Okay? Like this... This thing weighs about 100 pounds.

403
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:40,266
嗯, 就試試. 試試跳一下
Well, just try it. Try leaping a bit.

404
00:25:40,268 --> 00:25:41,701
像這樣
Like this.

405
00:25:49,777 --> 00:25:51,177
嗯, 好
Yeah, good.

406
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:52,612
走! 開拍! 開拍!
Go! Action! Action!

407
00:25:55,649 --> 00:25:57,684
再多點
More that way.

408
00:25:57,686 --> 00:25:59,219
再靠我一點
More towards me a bit.

409
00:25:59,221 --> 00:26:01,121
往那邊走開
Walk off that way.

410
00:26:01,123 --> 00:26:03,490
等會. 等會. 等會
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

411
00:26:03,492 --> 00:26:05,525
停
Stop.

412
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,731
我們應該晚上拍
We should be doing this at night.

413
00:26:11,733 --> 00:26:13,867
能不能, 能不能把燈往左邊移一點?
Can, can the light move a little bit to the left?

414
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:15,602
我被吞了 我在做飯
I'm being devoured and I'm cookin'.

415
00:26:15,604 --> 00:26:17,670
不, 那太遠了. 那太遠了
No, that's too far. That's too far.

416
00:26:17,672 --> 00:26:19,806
回來這邊. 回你右邊
Back over this way. Back to your right.

417
00:26:19,808 --> 00:26:22,175
沒事...停!停!
It doesn't matter...Stop! Stop!

418
00:26:22,177 --> 00:26:24,410
好, 現在往你左邊一點點
Okay, now a bit to your left.

419
00:26:24,412 --> 00:26:26,179
燈光要往下多少?
How much does the light drop off?

420
00:26:26,181 --> 00:26:28,381
你沒被蚊子咬死麼?
Are you not getting destroyed by mosquitoes?

421
00:26:28,383 --> 00:26:30,717
嗯, 咬死了. 我要搞好這個. 稍等
Okay, I am, but I'm trying to get this right. Hold on.

422
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:32,619
畫面裏還有啥?
What else is in the frame?

423
00:26:32,621 --> 00:26:35,188
額, 我看見後面有些木頭塊
Uh, I see some logs in the background.

424
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,390
是, 我也看見了. 好, 我去拿走
Yeah, I see it, too. Okay, I'm getting it.

425
00:26:39,627 --> 00:26:42,228
你就是要...
That's what you're...

426
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,831
好了, 開拍吧. 沒事, 沒事
Please, let's just roll. It's fine, it's fine.

427
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:46,699
這不是木頭. 這是塊岩石
It's not a log, it's a rock!

428
00:26:46,701 --> 00:26:48,835
沒事. 我們不把它拍進來
It's okay, we'll frame it out.

429
00:26:48,837 --> 00:26:50,703
我要用它!
I'm going to use it!

430
00:26:50,705 --> 00:26:52,572
我要把它拍進畫面裏頭
I'm going to put it in the frame.

431
00:26:52,574 --> 00:26:54,474
你準備好沒有?
Are you ready?

432
00:26:54,476 --> 00:26:56,509
開拍!
And action!

433
00:26:59,647 --> 00:27:01,714
Owen, 跳起來
Owen, jump in the air.

434
00:27:01,716 --> 00:27:03,316
老天爺
Holy shit.

435
00:27:04,586 --> 00:27:05,818
開著的!
It's open!

436
00:27:07,588 --> 00:27:10,190
嗨. 你來得正是時候
Hey. You're just in time.

437
00:27:10,192 --> 00:27:11,758
坐. 那個...
Have a seat. So...

438
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,327
登月錄像...我先不說效果
The moon footage...I won't say how it looks.

439
00:27:14,329 --> 00:27:17,330
我想你看看, 好不好? 關燈
I just want you to watch it, okay? Turn the lights off.

440
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,301
看起來可能有點不一樣
So it may seem a bit different.

441
00:27:21,303 --> 00:27:23,203
我想你會喜歡的
I think you'll enjoy it.

442
00:27:34,249 --> 00:27:36,449
那年我們還沒進局裏
This is the year before we got recruited.

443
00:27:36,451 --> 00:27:37,750
哇
Wow.

444
00:27:47,862 --> 00:27:50,263
哪位?
Who is it?

445
00:27:50,265 --> 00:27:51,631
你好?
Hello?

446
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:57,437
Brackett總監, 這是個...額, 請進
Director Brackett, this is a... uh, come on in.

447
00:28:01,575 --> 00:28:03,009
歡迎
Welcome.

448
00:28:05,512 --> 00:28:08,248
見到你們真好. 這是個驚喜
It's great to see you guys. This is a surprise.

449
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,450
這到底是怎麼回事？
What the hell is going on?

450
00:28:10,452 --> 00:28:13,553
你未經我授權就把項目方向給改了?
You're changing the direction on this project without my authorization?

451
00:28:13,555 --> 00:28:16,256
好...閉嘴. 我還沒說完
Okay...Shut up. I'm not finished.

452
00:28:16,258 --> 00:28:17,557
嗯, 我聽著...我把這個項目...
Okay, now listen...
I'm shutting this operation...

453
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:18,625
等等! 終止了. 結束了
Wait! Bring it down. It's over.

454
00:28:18,627 --> 00:28:19,993
這是你捏造的?
You made this up?

455
00:28:23,564 --> 00:28:26,399
嗯, 是的. 我捏造了個任務
Okay, yes. I made up a mission.

456
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:29,702
但那是因為在我提交給你之前, 我想確認它是可行的
But that's because I wanted to make sure it would work before I brought it to you.

457
00:28:29,704 --> 00:28:31,671
我想我可能已經解決了
I think I may have solved

458
00:28:31,673 --> 00:28:33,439
登月的問題
the moon problem.

459
00:28:33,441 --> 00:28:35,642
只要...相信我. 看這個
Just... trust me. Watch this.

460
00:28:36,844 --> 00:28:38,811
對不起
Sorry.

461
00:28:38,813 --> 00:28:42,582
無視這個. 無視這個
Ignore this. Ignore this.

462
00:29:05,739 --> 00:29:07,707
那些只是沙子
So that's just sand.

463
00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:09,042
William穿著宇航服
William's in the suit.

464
00:29:09,044 --> 00:29:10,843
我們用慢鏡頭來拍
We shot it in slow motion.

465
00:29:14,748 --> 00:29:16,849
你明白嗎?
You understand?

466
00:29:16,851 --> 00:29:20,953
我是說我們可以偽造登月, 這個不會很難
I'm saying we could fake the moon landing, and it wouldn't be hard.

467
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:23,723
所有人想看的
All people want to see

468
00:29:23,725 --> 00:29:25,558
是電視上的一個畫面
is an image on a television screen

469
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,093
我們可以給到他們
and we can give them that.

470
00:29:27,095 --> 00:29:28,728
火箭會升空
The rocket will go up,

471
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,563
我們會把錄像交給他們
we'll send our footage with them,

472
00:29:30,565 --> 00:29:32,832
而宇航員們只需要把它發送回地球
and the astronauts will just beam it back to earth.

473
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:36,669
沒人會去想這是偽造的, 因為那得多瘋狂?
No one is going to think this is fake, because how insane would that be?

474
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:38,071
如果我們不出錯
And if we do it right,

475
00:29:38,073 --> 00:29:40,873
他們就會一見就信
this is the kind of thing that sells itself.

476
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,975
Walter Cronkite 會給我們干一半的活
Walter Cronkite is going to do half the work for us.

477
00:29:45,846 --> 00:29:47,980
讓我試試
Let me try.

478
00:29:50,751 --> 00:29:52,852
你等一會
Give us a minute.

479
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,611
沒事
It's okay.

480
00:30:21,382 --> 00:30:23,483
Hi
Hi.

481
00:30:26,053 --> 00:30:27,120
哇!
Whoa!

482
00:30:38,432 --> 00:30:40,666
好, 從下面那邊拍, 好不好?
Okay, just shoot from down there, okay?

483
00:30:40,668 --> 00:30:42,735
Owen?
Owen?

484
00:30:42,737 --> 00:30:45,071
把...把你話筒戴上. 不
Put... put your mic on. No.

485
00:30:45,073 --> 00:30:47,540
把你話筒戴上. 把你...只要兩秒. 把你話筒戴上
Put your mic on. Put your... It'll take two seconds. Put your mic on.

486
00:30:47,542 --> 00:30:50,610
快. 只要兩秒. 我不戴, 好吧?
Come on. It'll take two seconds. I'm not doing this, okay?

487
00:30:52,012 --> 00:30:54,113
滾開. 振作點!
Get the fuck off. Cheer up!

488
00:30:54,115 --> 00:30:56,649
我們剛剛大獲提拔啊!
We just got a huge promotion, come on!

489
00:30:58,752 --> 00:31:00,186
哇!
Whoo!

490
00:31:06,126 --> 00:31:09,462
boles先生, 我猜我們又將會一起工作了
Mr. boles, I guess we'll be working together again.

491
00:31:09,464 --> 00:31:11,097
歡迎來到德克薩斯
Welcome to Texas.

492
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:13,633
恭喜這個瘋狂的任務獲得了Brackett的批准
Congratulations on having Brackett approve this insane mission.

493
00:31:15,002 --> 00:31:16,836
你們現在正在拍攝?
You guys are filming this right now?

494
00:31:16,838 --> 00:31:18,838
是的, 我們什麼都拍. 這是部紀錄片
Yeah, we film everything. It's a documentary.

495
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,707
是部紀錄片
It's a documentary film.

496
00:31:21,709 --> 00:31:24,977
好, 在我們啟動之前, 我知道技術上你是我上司
Okay, before we get started on this, I know you're technically my boss,

497
00:31:24,979 --> 00:31:26,879
但我在推動這一切
but I'm running all this.

498
00:31:26,881 --> 00:31:28,781
是
Yeah.

499
00:31:28,783 --> 00:31:30,783
不. 我到這是因為你根本不知道你在幹嘛
No, I'm here because you have no idea what you're doing.

500
00:31:30,785 --> 00:31:34,687
所以我說了算 你啥破事都不許推動
So I'm in charge and you don't run a goddamn thing.

501
00:31:37,858 --> 00:31:40,960
所以別在我們背後搞搞震了, 行不?
So no more fucking around behind our backs, all right?

502
00:31:49,036 --> 00:31:51,637
哇, 我聽說很糟糕
Wow, I heard it's pretty shitty.

503
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:53,673
Hi. 你怎麼樣?
Hi. How you doing?

504
00:31:53,675 --> 00:31:55,241
國慶節快不快樂?
Enjoying the 4th of July?

505
00:31:55,243 --> 00:31:57,510
嗯. 我心情大好
Yes, I'm in a great mood.

506
00:31:57,512 --> 00:32:00,813
這對我來說也有點像個派對, 因為我們獲得提拔了
This is a bit of a party for me too, because we got a promotion.

507
00:32:00,815 --> 00:32:02,615
是嗎? 嗯
Did you? Yeah.

508
00:32:04,551 --> 00:32:06,486
誰告訴我這是怎麼回事?
Somebody just tell me what's wrong.

509
00:32:06,488 --> 00:32:08,688
是不是...就是這個燒烤
Is that...That's the barbecue.

510
00:32:11,525 --> 00:32:14,627
什麼燒烤? 燒烤時候出了啥事? 怎麼回事?
The barbecue what? What happened at the barbecue? What's going on?

511
00:32:14,629 --> 00:32:16,095
看
Watch.

512
00:32:16,097 --> 00:32:17,897
就在...
Right...

513
00:32:18,832 --> 00:32:20,666
那裏. 看到沒有?
There. See that?

514
00:32:20,668 --> 00:32:23,503
嗯, 兩個人. 嗯, 看這個
Yeah, two guys. Yeah. Look at this.

515
00:32:26,608 --> 00:32:28,841
他舉著東西. 我們認為是超8攝像機
So he's holding something, we're thinking maybe super 8.

516
00:32:28,843 --> 00:32:30,843
那可能是台35毫米照相機
It could be a 35mm still camera.

517
00:32:30,845 --> 00:32:34,547
我們認不認識這人是誰? 他們可能是NASA的客人
And do we know who this is? Maybe they're NASA guests.

518
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:36,883
嗯, 我不知道. 遊客? 誰知道, 對不?
Yeah, I don't know. Tourists? Who knows, right?

519
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,286
可能沒啥
It could be nothing.

520
00:32:40,288 --> 00:32:42,655
就是沒啥...
It is nothing...

521
00:32:42,657 --> 00:32:44,056
哪位?
Who is it?

522
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:45,791
是boles
It's boles.

523
00:32:54,001 --> 00:32:55,535
垃圾
This looks like shit.

524
00:32:56,738 --> 00:32:59,906
一個人穿著宇航服
You have one guy in a space suit,

525
00:32:59,908 --> 00:33:01,741
在沙地上跳來跳去...
prancing around on the sand...

526
00:33:01,743 --> 00:33:03,709
還有塊石頭
with one rock.

527
00:33:03,711 --> 00:33:04,911
你覺得誰會信這個?
Who do you think this is gonna convince?

528
00:33:04,913 --> 00:33:06,812
我...Brackett信了
I...It convinced Brackett.

529
00:33:06,814 --> 00:33:09,081
好, 現在你得讓我信
Well, now you have to convince me.

530
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:10,249
你在說什麼?
What are you talking about?

531
00:33:10,251 --> 00:33:11,851
沒人會信這個
Nobody is going to buy this.

532
00:33:11,853 --> 00:33:14,153
我以為你支持我做這個
I thought you were advocating for me to do this!

533
00:33:14,155 --> 00:33:16,789
我原來在支持北木行動
I was advocating for operation Northwoods.

534
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:18,591
這個主意真是荒堂
I think this idea's ridiculous.

535
00:33:30,672 --> 00:33:33,873
Mike, 你記不記得曾經提到過, 額, 測試地點
Mike, do you remember mentioning, uh, test locations

536
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:36,275
NASA用來做拍照的那個?
that NASA was using for photography?

537
00:33:36,277 --> 00:33:38,010
能不能給我看看那些照片?
Would you mind showing me those pictures?

538
00:33:38,012 --> 00:33:39,211
你是說在攝像機上, 還是...
You mean on camera, or...

539
00:33:39,213 --> 00:33:41,047
如果你不介意的話. 我不介意
If you don't mind. I don't mind.

540
00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:43,249
這些是地球上看起來像月球的地方?
These are places that look like the moon on earth?

541
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:47,853
正是. 這些叫做地質實地考察
Exactly. These are called geology field trips.

542
00:33:47,855 --> 00:33:49,989
你是說月亮上的岩石
So you're saying that the rocks that are on the moon

543
00:33:49,991 --> 00:33:51,924
和地球上的岩石完全一樣?
are the exact same as the rocks on earth?

544
00:33:51,926 --> 00:33:53,960
我沒說完全. 我是說...但它們相似?
I'm not saying exact. I'm saying...But they're close?

545
00:33:53,962 --> 00:33:56,329
它們相似到...到...
They're close enough that...That...

546
00:33:56,331 --> 00:33:58,931
嗯, 我的意思是...如果你看到它們, 你會覺得, 額...
Yeah, I mean... So if you saw them, you would think that, uh...

547
00:33:58,933 --> 00:34:01,133
哦對, 你可以在美國這的火山上
Oh, yeah, you can get an igneous rock

548
00:34:01,135 --> 00:34:03,336
拿一塊火成岩
from a volcano here in America

549
00:34:03,338 --> 00:34:04,837
然後告訴別人這是塊月球岩石
and tell somebody it's a moon rock

550
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:06,238
他們不會知道
and they wouldn't know.

551
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,873
真的? 嗯
Really? Yeah.

552
00:34:16,984 --> 00:34:19,385
- 你好. -Owen在不在家?
- Hello. - Is Owen home?

553
00:34:19,387 --> 00:34:21,754
他在車庫裏
He's in the garage.

554
00:34:21,756 --> 00:34:23,089
你好棒
You look great.

555
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,096
FBI!
FBI!

556
00:34:30,098 --> 00:34:31,230
看這個!
Look at this!

557
00:34:31,232 --> 00:34:33,399
地質學家在地球上有地方
The geologists have places on earth

558
00:34:33,401 --> 00:34:35,067
已經看起來像月球
that already look like the moon.

559
00:34:35,069 --> 00:34:38,237
這是巴林傑隕石坑, 大峽谷
This is the Barringer crater, the Grand Canyon.

560
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,806
我們拍了這個錄像
We shoot this test footage

561
00:34:40,808 --> 00:34:42,908
然後和通過登月計劃得到的
and then compare it with the real moon footage

562
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:45,277
真的月球錄像做比較
that they're getting from the missions.

563
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:46,679
我剛剛搞明白!
I just figured this out!

564
00:34:46,681 --> 00:34:48,681
嗯. 我出不了這趟差
Yeah, I can't go on this trip.

565
00:34:48,683 --> 00:34:50,416
什麼? 什麼意思?
What? What do you mean?

566
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:52,151
為什麼?
Why?

567
00:34:52,153 --> 00:34:54,086
因為...因為...我需要你
Because I... because I...I need you.

568
00:34:54,088 --> 00:34:56,255
如果你不和我一起, 我就得一個人跟boles去
If you don't come with me I'm going with boles, by myself.

569
00:34:56,257 --> 00:34:58,157
什麼? 你還在生我的氣?
What? Are you still mad at me?

570
00:34:58,159 --> 00:34:59,859
對不起. 我沒有...
I'm sorry. I didn't...

571
00:34:59,861 --> 00:35:01,160
Owen!
Owen!

572
00:35:01,162 --> 00:35:03,095
等等!
One second!

573
00:35:03,097 --> 00:35:05,898
我...你必須原諒. 聽著
I... you have to forgive me for this. Listen.

574
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,066
我不能去
I can't go.

575
00:35:10,971 --> 00:35:14,306
我被你害死了 我被...我被你害死了
You're fucking me. You are...You're fucking me.

576
00:35:19,212 --> 00:35:21,447
這是個重大發射
This is the big shot.

577
00:35:21,449 --> 00:35:25,351
土星五號運載火箭的不載人飛行
The ride without astronauts of the giant Saturn v live rocket.

578
00:35:25,353 --> 00:35:28,421
阿波羅計劃. 這是阿波羅4號
Project Apollo. This is Apollo 4.

579
00:35:28,423 --> 00:35:31,090
我們登月火箭的首次飛行測試
The test of our moon rocket in flight for the first time.

580
00:35:31,092 --> 00:35:33,793
這是個開始, 一系列步驟中的第一步
It is the beginning, the first of many steps,

581
00:35:33,795 --> 00:35:37,329
有一天會把人送上月球表面
which will someday put men on the surface of the moon.

582
00:35:53,914 --> 00:35:55,314
你能看到多遠?
How far off can you see?

583
00:35:55,316 --> 00:35:56,849
你必須拍成黑白的
You've got to picture it in black and white.

584
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:58,250
在這. 太陽在我們後面
With the sun behind us there.

585
00:35:58,252 --> 00:35:59,385
我們甚至可以來個全景
We can even do a pan.

586
00:35:59,387 --> 00:36:01,454
你覺得怎麼樣?
What do you think?

587
00:36:01,456 --> 00:36:03,756
不知道你們是否能聽見, 女士們先生們
We don't know if you can hear, ladies and gentlemen.

588
00:36:03,758 --> 00:36:06,992
飛船正在按計劃飛行...
But, oh, the flight is moving along as it should be...

589
00:36:06,994 --> 00:36:09,428
750萬磅的推力
But our tape records are being thrown to the floor

590
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:12,998
在讓重型火箭不斷上升的同時,
by the roar of this mighty rocket,

591
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,834
巨大的轟鳴聲
as it continues to climb into the sky,

592
00:36:14,836 --> 00:36:18,204
還把我們的攝像機都震到了地板上
on its seven and a half million pounds of thrust.

593
00:36:18,206 --> 00:36:21,140
漂亮的場面, 難以置信的場面...
It's a beautiful sight, an unbelievable sight...

594
00:36:21,142 --> 00:36:24,343
我沒告訴他這全是我偽造的
So I didn't tell him I made the whole thing up,

595
00:36:24,345 --> 00:36:26,178
然後你和Brackett出現了
and then you and Brackett show up,

596
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,480
然後他給了我一拳
and then he punches me,

597
00:36:27,482 --> 00:36:28,881
現在他表現得我們不是朋友了
now he's acting like we aren't friends.

598
00:36:28,883 --> 00:36:30,850
你會怎麼做?
What would you do?

599
00:36:30,852 --> 00:36:32,785
嗯, 我不會一上來就那麼做
Well, I wouldn't have done that in the first place.

600
00:36:32,787 --> 00:36:34,053
對, 而是假裝你和我一樣愚蠢
Okay, yeah, but pretend that you're as stupid as me

601
00:36:34,055 --> 00:36:35,154
而且你已經那麼做了
and you have done that.

602
00:37:02,415 --> 00:37:04,984
該死的, 看這!
God damn it, look at this!

603
00:37:04,986 --> 00:37:07,119
我們差太遠了
We weren't even close.

604
00:37:07,121 --> 00:37:08,287
不開玩笑
No kidding.

605
00:37:12,425 --> 00:37:14,059
這
Here.

606
00:37:16,096 --> 00:37:18,230
好...好, 其他還有誰看過這錄像?
Okay... Okay, who else has seen this footage?

607
00:37:18,232 --> 00:37:19,431
每個人
Everyone.

608
00:37:19,433 --> 00:37:21,066
看, 這是我們想要的
See, this is what we need.

609
00:37:21,068 --> 00:37:24,003
我們需要真的月球錄像
We need the actual footage of the moon.

610
00:37:24,005 --> 00:37:26,872
我們怎麼把宇航員擺這前面做動作?
How do we get astronauts to act in front of this?

611
00:37:26,874 --> 00:37:29,542
你可以先找個真正的導演
You could start by hiring a real director.

612
00:37:31,511 --> 00:37:34,013
要不你就放棄這項任務
Or you could give up this mission.

613
00:37:35,882 --> 00:37:37,316
對
Yeah.

614
00:37:50,865 --> 00:37:52,031
嗨, 你好, don
Hey, don, how are you?

616
00:37:53,601 --> 00:37:55,134
不, 我是從休斯頓打電話
No, I'm calling from Houston,

617
00:37:55,136 --> 00:37:58,170
他們派我到這進行拉鏈行動
they got me out here on operation zipper.

618
00:37:58,172 --> 00:38:00,105
聽著, 能不能...我真的需要幫助
Listen, can...I actually need a favor.

619
00:38:00,107 --> 00:38:03,042
我們知不知道Stanley Kubrick(《2001太空漫遊》的導演)的最後地址
Do we have a last known address for Stanley Kubrick

620
00:38:03,044 --> 00:38:05,144
在我們執行深紅任務的時候
when we were doing operation deep red?

621
00:38:05,146 --> 00:38:06,579
我在看他電影裏頭的一些效果, 然後...
I'm looking at some of his movie effects and...

622
00:38:06,581 --> 00:38:08,447

"No, of course I'd like to say hello!"

623
00:38:08,449 --> 00:38:09,882
"我當然願意打招呼!"
Of course I'd like to say hello.

624
00:38:09,884 --> 00:38:11,050
我正在看東西
And I'm watching something.

625
00:38:11,052 --> 00:38:12,451
你能不能告訴我?
Would you mind giving me that?

626
00:38:15,957 --> 00:38:19,124
你好, 能不能給我一個紐約地址的電話號碼?
Hi, could you give me the phone number to an address in New York?

627
00:38:20,927 --> 00:38:22,528

633
00:38:32,573 --> 00:38:34,206
他在那嗎?
Is he there?

634
00:38:34,208 --> 00:38:36,208
是急事
It's an emergency.

635
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:38,644
當然不是. 不... 不是那樣的, 女士
Of course not. No. And... And that's not what this is, ma'am.

661
00:39:57,391 --> 00:39:59,425
你看出來這是怎麼回事了嗎?
Do you see what's going on here?

662

來確保真的太空電影看起來像太空!

你明不明白這得多瘋狂?
Do you understand how crazy that is?

667
00:40:28,755 --> 00:40:30,422
歡迎來到英格蘭!
Welcome to England!

668
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,259
這還不大聲音?
It's not too loud?

00:40:34,261 --> 00:40:36,195
不, 那個, 把它裝進一個袋子裏頭
No, well, it'll be packed inside the bag.

Not bad for... For on the spot, just figured it out!

671
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:54,046
Jared, 招手!
Jared, wave!

672
00:40:54,048 --> 00:40:55,614
Jared, 招招手!
Jared, big wave!

673
00:41:01,354 --> 00:41:03,188
對, 就是她
Yeah, that's her.

674
00:41:09,195 --> 00:41:11,263
Madeleine!
Madeleine!

675
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:19,605
你們不能帶攝像機進去
You won't be able to bring that camera inside.

676
00:41:19,607 --> 00:41:22,174
恐怕你們一進去就得關掉它
You'll have to shut it off as soon as we get in, I'm afraid.

677
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,709
Kubrick...全部都是現場
Is Mr...The set's all live.

678
00:41:23,711 --> 00:41:25,444
沒問題. Kubrick先生在不在裏面?
No problem. Is Mr. Kubrick inside?

679
00:41:25,446 --> 00:41:27,646
他在. 但安保非常嚴密
He is, but security is very tight.

680
00:41:27,648 --> 00:41:30,816
試圖靠近他的話你就會被扔出去. 所以不要
You'll be thrown off the set if you try to approach him, so please don't.

681
00:41:30,818 --> 00:41:32,551
知道了. 請進
You got it. Go ahead.

682
00:41:32,553 --> 00:41:33,752
謝謝
Thank you.

683
00:41:47,567 --> 00:41:50,135
請在這等會
Please wait right here.

684
00:41:50,137 --> 00:41:52,237
嗯, 好. 我們就待在這
Yeah, sure. We'll stay right here.

685
00:41:57,544 --> 00:41:59,511
拍成中景可能更好
It might be better to just play it as a medium shot

686
00:41:59,513 --> 00:42:01,713
- 在這種情況下 - 嗯, 嗯, 是
- in this situation. - Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

687
00:42:01,715 --> 00:42:03,515
你能不能低著頭來做?
Can you do it with your head down?

688
00:42:03,517 --> 00:42:05,250
在外面怎麼樣?
What about out there?

689
00:42:05,252 --> 00:42:08,287
- 嗯, 不錯. - 就這麼干
- Well, that's not bad. - Let's do that.

690
00:42:09,722 --> 00:42:11,657
對. 檢查一下大門, Doug
Right. Check the gate, Doug.

691
00:42:29,542 --> 00:42:32,211
我...我一般絕不會做這個, 但這是為了個朋友
I... I would never normally do this, but it's for a friend.

692
00:42:32,213 --> 00:42:35,347
他叫Matt Johnson. 嗯 嗯
His name is Matt Johnson. Mmm-hmm.

693
00:42:43,423 --> 00:42:46,692
Jared, 告訴我你在拍這個
Jared, tell me you are getting this.

694
00:42:46,694 --> 00:42:48,260
哦, 老天
Oh, my god.

695
00:42:48,262 --> 00:42:49,728
抱歉?
Excuse me?

696
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:53,432
你怎麼弄出來的?
How did you set this up?

697
00:42:54,868 --> 00:42:57,603
Owen, 那個叫前投影!
Owen, it's called front screen projection!

698
00:42:57,605 --> 00:42:58,804
我們找到了!
We got it!

699
00:43:01,241 --> 00:43:03,909
Kubrick的技術, 他怎麼假造...
Kubrick's technique, how he's faking...

700
00:43:05,678 --> 00:43:07,713
我要...我要告訴你
I wanna...I wanna tell you.

701
00:43:15,288 --> 00:43:17,156
Boles, 嗨
Boles, hey.

702
00:43:17,158 --> 00:43:18,824
那個叫前投影
It's called front screen projection.

703
00:43:18,826 --> 00:43:20,826
我們搞懂怎麼, 怎麼做了
We figured out how to, how to do it.

704
00:43:22,695 --> 00:43:25,397
嗯, 好, 好的. 我會,
Yeah, okay, all right. I'll, uh...

705
00:43:25,399 --> 00:43:27,866
你想我們直接飛去那, 還是...
Do you want us to fly right there, or...

706
00:43:30,203 --> 00:43:32,404
當然
Sure.

707
00:43:44,584 --> 00:43:47,586
好, 那個叫前投影
All right, it's called front screen projection.

708
00:43:47,588 --> 00:43:50,689
Stanley Kubrick可以做出任何他想要的環境
Stanley Kubrick can fake any environment he wants,

709
00:43:50,691 --> 00:43:53,592
只要把它投射到一面半透明的鏡子上
by projecting it through a semi-transparent mirror

710
00:43:53,594 --> 00:43:56,361
再反射到一面巨大的銀幕上
and then onto a gigantic silver screen.

711
00:43:56,363 --> 00:43:59,731
然後他透過那面半透明鏡子來拍下整個畫面
Then he films the entire scene through the same mirror,

712
00:43:59,733 --> 00:44:02,334
攝像機和放映機成90度角
at a 90-degree angle to the projector.

713
00:44:02,336 --> 00:44:05,737
最終效果就是出來的畫面
What it winds up doing is creating images

714
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:09,675
你分不清楚舞台在哪結束
where you can't tell where the stage stops

715
00:44:11,678 --> 00:44:14,880
假造的照片背景從哪開始
and the fake photographic background begins.

716
00:44:14,882 --> 00:44:16,982
你能在一個完全二維的空間環境裏頭
You have an infinite depth of field,

717
00:44:16,984 --> 00:44:22,688
獲取無限的景深
into environments that exist completely in two-dimensional space.

718
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:25,958
我們可以用NASA在阿波羅計劃中拍到的
We can do the same thing with the lunar surface photography

719
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,760
月球表面照片來做同樣的事情
that NASA is taking on the Apollo missions.

720
00:44:32,865 --> 00:44:36,535
電影特技可以非常逼真
Movie special effects can be very convincing,

721
00:44:36,537 --> 00:44:40,739
特別是在你不知道你在看電影的時候
especially when you don't know you're watching a movie.

722
00:44:40,741 --> 00:44:43,942
計劃是在德克薩斯租一個電影工作室
The plan is to rent a film studio in Texas,

723
00:44:43,944 --> 00:44:48,513
雇一組人, 讓他們造一個我們自己的月球登陸器
hire a crew, and have them build our own lunar lander.

724
00:44:48,515 --> 00:44:50,716
我們會把這個真實的道具
We'll mix this practical set piece,

725
00:44:50,718 --> 00:44:53,585
和Kubrick的投影技術合成在一起, 然後, 變
with Kubrick's projection technique, and presto,

726
00:44:53,587 --> 00:44:56,521
人正在月球上面行走
the illusion that man is walking on the moon.

727
00:44:56,523 --> 00:44:59,458
現在我知道你可能在想這太暴露了
Now I know you're probably thinking this is too much exposure,

728
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,461
把外人牽扯進來的風險太高
and that the risk of bringing in outsiders is too high,

729
00:45:02,463 --> 00:45:05,430
但是我們已經有極好的掩護
but we already have the perfect cover.

730
00:45:05,432 --> 00:45:09,268
我們正在拍攝登月紀錄片
We're making a documentary about the moon landing.

731
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:12,271
說我們在搭建場景用於採訪, 這很正常
And it's not a stretch to say that we're building sets to conduct interviews,

732
00:45:12,273 --> 00:45:13,739
拍攝備用錄像
shoot b-roll footage.

733
00:45:13,741 --> 00:45:15,707
我們甚至可以說這是用來做模擬的
We could even say it's for simulations.

734
00:45:15,709 --> 00:45:18,844
拜託, 絕大部份主流電視網絡已經在這麼做了
Hell, most of the major networks are doing this already.

735
00:45:18,846 --> 00:45:20,512
唯一需要知道真相的人
The only people who need to know what's actually happening

736
00:45:20,514 --> 00:45:22,748
是宇航員
are the astronauts,

737
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:25,417
你要選那些願意合作的
who you should select based on their willingness to cooperate,

738
00:45:25,419 --> 00:45:27,552
然後James Webb
and James Webb,

739
00:45:27,554 --> 00:45:30,622
他要麼只能跟我們一起干, 要麼閃開別擋道
who's either going to have to work with us, or get out of the way.

740
00:45:30,624 --> 00:45:32,691
這塊是容易的
And that's the easy part.

741
00:45:32,693 --> 00:45:34,793
我們還需要說服NASA的每一個人
We also need to convince everybody at NASA.

742
00:45:34,795 --> 00:45:37,663
好消息是和火箭有接觸的人
The good news is the only people who are in contact with the rocket

743
00:45:37,665 --> 00:45:39,398
全都在休斯頓的一間屋子
are all in one room in Houston,

744
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,799
在任務控制室裏
inside mission control.

745
00:45:41,968 --> 00:45:44,436
如果我們能夠說服任務控制室
If we can convince mission control

746
00:45:44,438 --> 00:45:45,537
他們做的都是真的
that what they're doing is real,

747
00:45:45,539 --> 00:45:46,638
其他人都會跟進
everybody else will follow.

748
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,507
我們怎麼做得到?
How do we do that?

749
00:45:48,509 --> 00:45:51,343
任務控制室監控著一切
Well, mission control actually monitors everything,

750
00:45:51,345 --> 00:45:52,844
從宇航員的心率
from the heart rates of the astronauts,

751
00:45:52,846 --> 00:45:54,613
到登月艙的確切位置
to the exact location of the lunar module

752
00:45:54,615 --> 00:45:56,715
在降落月球過程中
as it descends to the moon.

753
00:45:56,717 --> 00:45:58,917
他們通過無線電直接從飛船上
And they're getting all this information through radio,

754
00:45:58,919 --> 00:46:00,552
獲得這些信息
directly from the ship.

755
00:46:00,554 --> 00:46:03,322
好消息是在這項任務中
The good news is that they've run so many tests

756
00:46:03,324 --> 00:46:05,457
他們已經做過這麼多測試
with this exact mission

757
00:46:05,459 --> 00:46:09,561
他們真的獲得了成功登月的遙測數據
that they actually have telemetric data of successful lunar landings,

758
00:46:09,563 --> 00:46:12,731
保存在阿波羅11號的導航系統裏
stored on guidance systems on Apollo 11.

759
00:46:14,467 --> 00:46:16,568
這點上我們非常幸運
Here's where we get very lucky.

760
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:18,003
當指令艙運行到
As the command module passes along

761
00:46:18,005 --> 00:46:19,604
月球背面的時候
to the dark side of the moon,

762
00:46:19,606 --> 00:46:22,641
無線電信號無法穿過月球
the radio signals can't penetrate the core.

763
00:46:22,643 --> 00:46:24,843
我們有30分鐘的窗口期
For 30 minutes, we have a window

764
00:46:24,845 --> 00:46:29,481
宇航員用來從真實數據切換到假的遙測數據
for the astronauts to switch from real data, to fake telemetric data.

765
00:46:29,483 --> 00:46:31,750
任務控制室會接收到
Mission control will be getting data

766
00:46:31,752 --> 00:46:35,520
登月艙分離和在月球表面著陸的數據
of the lunar module undocking and landing on the lunar surface,

767
00:46:35,522 --> 00:46:37,889
但完全是假造的
but it will be completely faked.

768
00:46:37,891 --> 00:46:40,058
宇航員把那些數據
Combine that with our footage

769
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:43,362
和我們的錄像一起發送回地球
that the astronauts are going to pipe into the broadcast back to earth,

770
00:46:43,364 --> 00:46:45,931
沒人會發現任何問題
and nobody's going to have any idea.

771
00:46:45,933 --> 00:46:48,633
對NASA和全世界來說
As far as NASA and the rest of the world is concerned,

772
00:46:48,635 --> 00:46:50,769
美國剛剛登陸月球
the United States just landed on the moon.

773
00:46:50,771 --> 00:46:54,406
最後, 廣播
Finally, the broadcast.

774
00:46:54,408 --> 00:46:56,875
因為需要慢動作, 我們不得不拍成電影
To shoot in slow motion, we have to shoot film.

775
00:46:56,877 --> 00:46:59,444
廣播的話需要是視頻
To broadcast it needs to be video.

776
00:46:59,446 --> 00:47:00,579
意味著我們不得不做個轉換
Which means we have to do a transfer,

777
00:47:00,581 --> 00:47:02,147
這通常都沒有問題
which normally would be fine,

778
00:47:02,149 --> 00:47:06,118
只是不能讓人們知道它原來是個電影
except that people cannot know it originally began as film.

779
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,587
這意味著有一點劃痕, 一點灰塵...
That means a single scratch, any dust...

780
00:47:08,589 --> 00:47:10,522
好, 好. 我們知道了
Okay, okay. We got it.

781
00:47:10,524 --> 00:47:11,890
謝謝你的演示
Thank you for the presentation.

782
00:47:11,892 --> 00:47:13,992
你可以繼續
You can go ahead.

783
00:47:13,994 --> 00:47:16,161
- 謝謝, 先生. - 和你的人講講北木計劃
- Thank you, sir. - Talk to your folks about the Northwoods plan.

784
00:47:16,163 --> 00:47:17,796
告訴他們在上頭裝個把手
Tell them to put a hold on it

785
00:47:17,798 --> 00:47:20,565
然後我們能知道進展
and we'll see how this develops.

786
00:47:20,567 --> 00:47:22,801
總監, 北木計劃是什麼?
Director, what is the Northwoods plan?

787
00:47:22,803 --> 00:47:25,437
我從來沒聽說過北木行動
I've never heard of operation Northwoods.

788
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:29,107
擊落阿波羅11號並歸咎於蘇聯
Shoot down Apollo 11 and blame the Soviets.

789
00:47:30,544 --> 00:47:32,444
和飛船上的宇航員一起?
With the astronauts on the flight?

790
00:47:32,446 --> 00:47:34,613
我們為什麼這麼做?
Why would we do that?

791
00:47:36,149 --> 00:47:38,750
如果沒有你的電影
If your film doesn't come together,

792
00:47:38,752 --> 00:47:41,186
那我們不得不做個後備計劃
then we have to have a backup plan.

793
00:47:41,188 --> 00:47:43,822
我們的後備計劃就是那個
And that is our backup plan.

794
00:47:58,938 --> 00:48:01,473
計劃? 我從沒聽說過北木計劃
Plan? I've never heard of operation Northwoods.

795
00:48:01,475 --> 00:48:03,675
擊落阿波羅11號並歸咎於蘇聯
Shoot down Apollo 11 and blame the Soviets.

796
00:48:29,869 --> 00:48:32,671
這些去月球的人是誰?
Who were these men going to the moon?

797
00:48:32,673 --> 00:48:36,741
David Schoumacher介紹阿波羅11號乘員
David Schoumacher profiled the crew of Apollo 11.

798
00:48:36,743 --> 00:48:38,743
Neil Armstrong
Neil Armstrong,

799
00:48:38,745 --> 00:48:42,180
被選為第一個踏上月球
the man chosen to be first to step upon the moon.

800
00:48:42,182 --> 00:48:45,517
每個人都說他聰明, 有禮
He is by all accounts intelligent, courteous,

801
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:47,886
冷靜, 家庭好男人
sober, a good family man.

802
00:48:47,888 --> 00:48:50,555
他是這個角色的完美人選
He is perfect for the role,

803
00:48:50,557 --> 00:48:54,793
好萊塢編劇都找不到這麼好的人
beyond what a Hollywood scriptwriter would dare.

804
00:48:54,795 --> 00:48:57,796
Buzz Aldrin可能是這些宇航員中最聰明的
Buzz Aldrin is perhaps the most brilliant of the astronauts.

805
00:48:57,798 --> 00:49:00,031
有人甚至說他是天才
Some say even a genius.

806
00:49:00,033 --> 00:49:04,736
一篇軌道交匯的博士論文給他帶來的麻省理工的博士學位
His doctorate at Mit came after a thesis on orbital rendezvous,

807
00:49:04,738 --> 00:49:08,039
和其他人一樣
and he understands the abstract theory of space mechanics

808
00:49:08,041 --> 00:49:10,542
他懂得空間力學的抽像理論
as well as anyone.

809
00:49:10,544 --> 00:49:15,514
在阿波羅11號的宇航員中Mike Collins看起來一點不像技術人員
Mike Collins is the least technical in outlook of the Apollo 11 astronauts,

810
00:49:15,516 --> 00:49:17,148
反倒很像哲學家
but the most philosophical.

811
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:19,117
如果他不愛機器的話
If he does not love machines,

812
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:23,188
他確實喜歡紅酒, 書, 和玫瑰
he does love wine, and books, and roses.

813
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:25,957
一位認識三個宇航員多年的人說
A man who has known all three pilots for many years

814
00:49:25,959 --> 00:49:28,560
如果他迫降在一個島上
says if he were forced down on an island,

815
00:49:28,562 --> 00:49:30,295
他希望會是和Collins一起
he would want it to be with Collins

816
00:49:30,297 --> 00:49:32,597
因為他的人格魅力
for the quality of his personality.

817
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:34,132
另一位說他希望是Aldrin
Another said he would prefer Aldrin,

818
00:49:34,134 --> 00:49:36,167
因為憑著他的聰明才智
because with his intelligence

819
00:49:36,169 --> 00:49:38,303
他很快就已經在把海水轉化成淡水了
he would soon be converting sea water to fresh water

820
00:49:38,305 --> 00:49:40,972
然後有條理地解決問題
and otherwise logically attacking the problem.

821
00:49:40,974 --> 00:49:43,542
但分析到最後兩人都同意
But both agreed in the final analysis,

822
00:49:43,544 --> 00:49:46,711
他們希望是和Armstrong一起
that they would hope it was with Armstrong,

823
00:49:46,713 --> 00:49:50,615
因為, 通過某種辦法, 他會帶他們脫離困境
because, somehow, he would get them off of it.

824
00:49:57,791 --> 00:49:59,257
喂
Hello?

825
00:49:59,259 --> 00:50:02,227
Boles, 我們剛回來. 你在哪?
Boles, we just got back. Where are you?

826
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:06,164
好. 把電視打開
Okay. Turn on the TV.

827
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:08,166
嗯, 好. 正在開
Yeah, okay. I'm turning it on now.

828
00:50:08,168 --> 00:50:10,635
- 為什麼? - 小結下你剛才說的
- Why? - Summarize what you just said,

829
00:50:10,637 --> 00:50:12,270
然後我們會問你幾個和見總統有關的問題?
and then we'll ask you some questions about seeing the president?

830
00:50:12,272 --> 00:50:17,042
啊, 是的, 我想說, 在一年前
Uh, yes, I'd like to say that, uh, over a year ago,

831
00:50:17,044 --> 00:50:20,745
約翰遜總統和我審查了太空計劃
president Johnson and I reviewed the space program

832
00:50:20,747 --> 00:50:24,082
同意增加力量
and, uh, agreed to build strength

833
00:50:24,084 --> 00:50:27,752
因此我可能在我62歲生日時退休
so that I might retire on my 62nd birthday,

834
00:50:27,754 --> 00:50:30,689
剛好就是這下一個10月7日
which happens to be this next October 7th.

835
00:50:30,691 --> 00:50:33,925
今天, 我們審查了我們的進度
Today, we have reviewed the progress we have made

836
00:50:33,927 --> 00:50:35,594
總統已經同意
and the president has agreed

837
00:50:35,596 --> 00:50:38,830
我可以在10月7日退休
that I could retire on October 7th,

838
00:50:38,832 --> 00:50:40,632
到時候我62歲
when I will be 62.

839
00:50:40,634 --> 00:50:42,601
我還想說另一件事...
I'd like to say one other thing...

840
00:50:42,603 --> 00:50:44,603
嗯, 好. 我猜這意味著
Yeah, okay. Well, I guess that means

841
00:50:44,605 --> 00:50:46,838
他不打算合作, 嗯?
he didn't want to cooperate, huh?

842
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,206
好, 是
Okay, yeah.

843
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:50,275
你回來後我會見你. 再見
I'll see you when you get back. Bye.

844
00:50:55,181 --> 00:50:56,881
Andy!
Andy!

845
00:50:59,719 --> 00:51:00,986
對不起
Sorry.

846
00:51:03,389 --> 00:51:05,690
你在做什麼? 給紀錄片拍東西
What are you doing? Shooting for the documentary.

847
00:51:05,692 --> 00:51:06,992
哦, 好, 沒事
Oh, okay, fine.

848
00:51:06,994 --> 00:51:09,327
Owen在哪? 他在醫院
Where's Owen? He's at the hospital.

849
00:51:09,329 --> 00:51:10,829
什麼?
What?

850
00:51:11,931 --> 00:51:13,732
Julie生了
Julie had the baby.

851
00:51:13,734 --> 00:51:15,367
哦, 該死!
Oh, shit!

852
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:19,971
嗨
Hey.

853
00:51:19,973 --> 00:51:21,673
我錯過了, 嗨?
I missed it, hey?

854
00:51:21,675 --> 00:51:23,341
嗨, 媽媽
Hey, mom.

855
00:51:23,343 --> 00:51:25,043
哇!
Wow!

856
00:51:25,045 --> 00:51:26,144
Matt!
Matt!

857
00:51:26,146 --> 00:51:28,046
他叫什麼名字? Simon
What's his name? Simon.

858
00:51:28,048 --> 00:51:30,015
我能抱抱他嗎? 當然, 如果你想的話
Can I hold him? Sure, if you want to.

859
00:51:30,017 --> 00:51:31,650
我有話和你說. 我要和Matt談談
I need to talk to you. I need to talk to Matt.

860
00:51:31,652 --> 00:51:33,418
好. 怎麼了?
Okay. What's up?

861
00:51:35,254 --> 00:51:38,390
就一會
One minute.

862
00:51:38,392 --> 00:51:41,393
好, 好
Okay, okay.

863
00:51:41,395 --> 00:51:43,728
這是什麼鬼?
What the hell is this?

864
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:44,996
Jared給我看了那人的照片
Jared showed me the photos of the men

865
00:51:44,998 --> 00:51:46,965
在燒烤時候看我們的那個人
who were watching us at the barbecue.

866
00:51:46,967 --> 00:51:48,800
他們在拍我們, Matt! 好
They're filming us, Matt! Okay.

867
00:51:48,802 --> 00:51:51,169
你把這些帶到醫院來幹啥?
Why are you bringing this up at the hospital?

868
00:51:51,171 --> 00:51:52,737
放鬆!
Relax!

869
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:54,372
放鬆? 這可能是俄國人
Relax? This could be the Russians.

870
00:51:54,374 --> 00:51:56,941
我們必須離開這個任務
We have to get off this mission.

871
00:51:56,943 --> 00:52:01,446
如果我們被抓了, 中情局會拋棄我們, 好吧?
If we get caught, the CIA will abandon us, okay?

872
00:52:01,448 --> 00:52:04,015
我要給Brackett打電話告訴他...不! 不! 不!
I'm calling Brackett to tell him...No! No! No!

873
00:52:04,017 --> 00:52:06,685
你不能給Brackett打電話. 誰也不能打給Brackett
You are not calling Brackett. No one's calling Brackett.

874
00:52:06,687 --> 00:52:08,186
你是在疑神疑鬼
You are being paranoid!

875
00:52:08,188 --> 00:52:11,756
我希望是, 因為如果我是對的, 這就是那個鼴鼠...
I hope so, because if I'm right and this is the mole...

876
00:52:11,758 --> 00:52:12,857
如果他們發現了我們在做什麼
If they find out what we are doing,

877
00:52:12,859 --> 00:52:14,759
那我們就死定了
then we are fucking dead.

878
00:52:14,761 --> 00:52:16,094
你明不明白?
You got that?

879
00:53:18,224 --> 00:53:20,125
看起來很好
Looks pretty good.

880
00:53:20,127 --> 00:53:22,494
"看起來很好"? 怎麼說話的, 夥計
"Looks pretty good"? Guys, come on.

881
00:53:25,364 --> 00:53:27,198
你是不是在開玩笑? 好
Are you kidding me? All right.

882
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,933
這花了45000塊!
This cost $45,000!

883
00:53:30,069 --> 00:53:31,369
真的? 是!
Really? Yeah!

884
00:53:31,371 --> 00:53:33,838
哦, 老天, 別這個語氣
Oh, god, don't start that.

885
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,974
"真的? 嗨, 你被騙了
"Really? Hey, you got ripped off.

886
00:53:35,976 --> 00:53:38,042
"嗨, 算了吧, 我能把這事做得...更省錢
"Hey, come on, I could have done this..." ...Cheaper.

887
00:53:38,044 --> 00:53:40,845
"花20塊, 再加些體力活"
"with $20 and some elbow grease!"

888
00:53:40,847 --> 00:53:43,047
說句"幹得好, Matt"你會死啊?
Do you think it would kill you to say, "good job, Matt"?

889
00:53:45,018 --> 00:53:47,852
我是說真的. 你是不是覺得會死?
I mean that seriously. Do you think it would physically kill you?

890
00:53:47,854 --> 00:53:49,988
嗯, 那是用來拍電影的
Okay, and it's for a film shoot.

891
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:52,390
我們在拍一部關於登月的紀錄片
Uh, we're making a documentary about the moon landing,

892
00:53:52,392 --> 00:53:54,359
我們需要做一個月球表面
and we need to make a lunar surface.

893
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:57,962
相當於是個假的月球表面. 我們要的就是這個
And so it's like a fake lunar surface. That's what we need.

894
00:53:57,964 --> 00:54:01,299
不知道你們能運多少沙子來給我們
So I don't know how much sand you can ship us.

895
00:54:01,301 --> 00:54:03,434
不過, 四噸?
But, uh, four tons?

896
00:54:03,436 --> 00:54:05,370
一車能裝多少噸? 能不能稍等?
How many tons are in a truck? Can you hold on a sec?

897
00:54:05,372 --> 00:54:07,338
你要去哪?
Where are you going?

898
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:09,307
抱歉, 再說一遍?
Uh, sorry, say again?

899
00:54:09,309 --> 00:54:12,410
其實, 我去過亞利桑那州一個叫煤渣湖的地方
Actually, I went to a place in Arizona called cinder lake,

900
00:54:12,412 --> 00:54:16,848
那的沙顏色就像綜色的糖漿. 很漂亮
where the sand was brown as molasses. It was beautiful.

901
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:20,251
很漂亮的綜色. 融化的綜色
It was a beautiful brown. Molten brown.

902
00:54:27,226 --> 00:54:30,128
他們上去後這些人會說點啥?
So, what are these guys gonna say when they're up here?

903
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:32,564
我們需要點他們能印成頭條的東西
We need something they can print as a headline.

904
00:54:32,566 --> 00:54:35,433
敲點東西出來讓我們看看有啥, 好不好?
Type out a couple things and let's just see what we got, okay?

905
00:54:35,435 --> 00:54:38,169
試試這個, "歡迎來到月亮"
So try this, "welcome to the moon."

906
00:54:39,973 --> 00:54:42,173
接著!
Catch!

907
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:44,509
別管它, 就讓它在那, 那是我的岩石
So, no, leave that where it was, it's my a rock.

908
00:54:44,511 --> 00:54:47,011
我想如果我們根本不說"美國"這個詞的話
I think if we never say the word "America."

909
00:54:47,013 --> 00:54:48,546
是, 我們只是拿一個美國符號
Oh, yeah, we just take an American symbol.

910
00:54:48,548 --> 00:54:50,081
就是. 老鷹
Exactly. Eagle.

911
00:54:50,083 --> 00:54:51,149
- 自由. - 前沿
- Freedom. - Frontier.

912
00:54:51,151 --> 00:54:53,284
前沿
Frontier.

913
00:54:53,286 --> 00:54:56,387
那個需要在那邊做個坑
So that needs to make that pothole there.

914
00:54:56,389 --> 00:54:57,922
那個上面有沒有標籤?
Does that have a label on it?

915
00:54:57,924 --> 00:55:01,226
B. 那它就剛好在你腳那. 完美
B. So that goes right at your feet. Perfect.

916
00:55:01,228 --> 00:55:03,228
我剛想出個點子
I just got an idea.

917
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:04,863
你覺得他們上到去後我們該讓他們做什麼?
You know what we've gotta have them do when they're up there?

918
00:55:04,865 --> 00:55:06,397
是誰, 伽利略還是誰, 說過...
Who is it, Galileo or somebody, said...

919
00:55:06,399 --> 00:55:07,599
扔羽毛
Oh, drop the feather.

920
00:55:07,601 --> 00:55:08,900
扔羽毛和鎯頭
Drop the feather and the hammer.

921
00:55:08,902 --> 00:55:10,435
他說, 在真空裏頭
And he said, in a vacuum,

922
00:55:10,437 --> 00:55:12,637
鎯頭和羽毛會以相同速度落下
a hammer and a feather would fall at the same speed.

923
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:14,405
嗯, 好, 但我們該怎麼做出這效果?
Well, okay, but how are we gonna do that?

924
00:55:14,407 --> 00:55:16,341
用鉛做的羽毛
A lead feather.

925
00:55:16,343 --> 00:55:19,277
等等, 我們必須讓旗幟盡可能的穩定
Wait a minute, we gotta keep the flag as stable as possible,

926
00:55:19,279 --> 00:55:21,913
因為旗子飄說明有風
because the wind resistance makes it billow.

927
00:55:21,915 --> 00:55:23,548
你揮旗. 你不能揮!
You wave the flag. You can't do that!

928
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:25,516
好休斯頓, 我準備走出登月艙
Okay Houston, I'm about to step off the LM.

929
00:55:25,518 --> 00:55:27,886
他在那留下了個腳印
He leaves a footprint there.

930
00:55:27,888 --> 00:55:29,487
因為他們會在那留下腳印. 就是!
'Cause they would leave footprints there. Exactly!

931
00:55:29,489 --> 00:55:31,890
我們可以把那些照片傳送回家
And we so can send photographs of that back home.

932
00:55:31,892 --> 00:55:34,325
它是...那是...就是那個畫面!
It's... that's...That is the image!

933
00:55:34,327 --> 00:55:35,560
寫下來! 腳印!
Write that down, the footprints!

934
00:55:35,562 --> 00:55:38,296
"腳"這個字好噁心
The word "foot" is disgusting.

935
00:55:38,298 --> 00:55:40,565
大家可能不想聽到"腳"
Maybe people don't want to hear "foot."

936
00:55:40,567 --> 00:55:42,166
不, "隨著這一步." 你會說, "隨著這一步."
No, "with this step." You would say, "with this step."

937
00:55:42,168 --> 00:55:44,235
"隨著這一步."
"With this step."

938
00:55:44,237 --> 00:55:47,639
好, 好. "隨著這一步, 我..."
Okay, okay. "With this step, I..."

939
00:55:47,641 --> 00:55:50,341
不. "當人走在月亮上的時候..."
No. "As man walks on the moon..."

940
00:55:50,343 --> 00:55:52,277
太平淡了. 太平淡了!
Too literal. Too literal!

941
00:55:52,279 --> 00:55:53,945
"一個人的這步..."
"The step of a single man..."

942
00:55:53,947 --> 00:55:55,213
"一個人的這步."
"The step of a single man.

943
00:55:55,215 --> 00:55:56,981
"但是對於後方在家s的我們來說..."
"But for us back at home..."

944
00:55:56,983 --> 00:55:59,017
想想對我們來說一步像啥
Think of what a step is like to us.

945
00:55:59,019 --> 00:56:00,952
對一個人來說, 一步就只是一步
To a man, a step is just a step.

946
00:56:00,954 --> 00:56:04,355
但對一隻抬頭看人的螞蟻來說, 他看起來就跟神一樣
But to an ant looking up at the man, he looks like a god.

947
00:56:04,357 --> 00:56:05,623
它看起來不像是一步
And it doesn't look like a step,

948
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:09,460
它看起來就像是巨大的飛躍
it looks like a towering leap.

949
00:56:14,534 --> 00:56:16,601
像是躍進. 像是跳躍
It's like a leap. It's like a jump.

950
00:56:16,603 --> 00:56:19,237
這個躍進是為了...為了一切!
And this is a leap forward for...For everything!

951
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:20,571
下一個進化步驟
The next evolutionary step.

952
00:56:20,573 --> 00:56:22,006
科學上的躍進
A leap forward in science.

953
00:56:22,008 --> 00:56:24,008
- 對人類. - 正是!
- For humanity. - Exactly!

954
00:56:37,489 --> 00:56:39,190
這很好
This is good.

955
00:56:45,966 --> 00:56:47,365
好, 我們試拍一個
Okay, let's try one.

956
00:56:47,367 --> 00:56:49,300
嗨
Hey.

957
00:56:49,302 --> 00:56:51,736
外面那人你認不認識? 誰?
Do you know who that is outside? Who?

958
00:56:53,205 --> 00:56:55,206
就那
Right there.

959
00:56:55,208 --> 00:56:56,641
看. 哪?
Look. Where?

960
00:56:56,643 --> 00:56:58,109
告訴我他是誰
Tell me whose that is.

961
00:56:59,478 --> 00:57:01,346
他在跑?
Is he running?

962
00:57:01,348 --> 00:57:02,714
你有沒和他打招呼? 你進來的時候他有沒看你?
Did you say hi? Did he look at you when you came in?

963
00:57:02,716 --> 00:57:04,282
裏頭究竟有人沒人?
Is there even a guy in there?

964
00:57:04,284 --> 00:57:06,050
他一直坐在那看
He's sitting there watching.

965
00:57:06,052 --> 00:57:08,019
噓. 噓. 走出去, 你就明白了
Shh. Shh. Go outside, you'll see.

966
00:57:08,021 --> 00:57:09,754
我保證他是在這個製作室的員工. 我去和他聊聊
I'm sure he works for the studio. I'll go talk to him.

967
00:57:09,756 --> 00:57:11,990
他們知道我們在這. 我們可以在這, 好吧?
They know we're here. We're allowed to be here, okay?

968
00:57:11,992 --> 00:57:13,224
放鬆
Relax.

969
00:57:13,226 --> 00:57:14,292
好
Okay.

970
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:19,731
嗨
Hi.

971
00:57:24,737 --> 00:57:28,039
追, 追, 追, 追!
Go, go, go, go!

972
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:30,008
Jared, 上車!
Jared, get in the car!

973
00:57:39,385 --> 00:57:41,152
Boles, 你在幹啥?
Boles, what are you doing?

974
00:57:43,456 --> 00:57:45,590
怎麼回事? 你TMD開槍了!
What happened? You shot your fucking gun!

975
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,394
Jared, 拍前面
Jared, shoot out the front,

976
00:57:49,396 --> 00:57:51,329
盡量拍到車牌!
try to get their license plate!

977
00:57:52,331 --> 00:57:55,466
快!
Come on!

978
00:57:55,468 --> 00:57:57,502
- 不! - 什麼?
- No! - What?

979
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:07,145
怎麼了?
What happened?

980
00:58:07,147 --> 00:58:08,679
你的車怎麼了?
What happened to your car?

981
00:58:08,681 --> 00:58:11,249
熄火了. 他們跑了
It stalled. They got away.

982
00:58:11,251 --> 00:58:13,484
你有沒看見他們?
Well, did you get a look at them?

983
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,721
不管是誰, 他們知道我們在這
Whoever it is, they know we're here.

984
00:58:16,723 --> 00:58:17,789
我們不知道他們是誰
Well, we don't know who it is.

985
00:58:17,791 --> 00:58:20,258
我覺得是那個鼴鼠
I think it's the mole.

986
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,293
我覺得他就是你們當初把我們派來這找的那個鼴鼠
I think it's the mole that you guys sent us here to find in the first place.

987
00:58:22,295 --> 00:58:24,162
等在工作室外頭那個是誰
Who else is waiting outside the studio

988
00:58:24,164 --> 00:58:25,530
我們走出來的時候...讓我們把門鎖上
and then the minute we walk out...Let's lock it up.

989
00:58:25,532 --> 00:58:27,198
鎖起來然後給Brackett打電話
Let's lock it up and call Brackett.

990
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,466
什麼...鎖起來? 我們才做了一半!
What... lock it up? We're in the middle of this!

991
00:58:28,468 --> 00:58:30,201
我們不能停止拍攝!
We can't just stop shooting!

992
00:58:30,203 --> 00:58:32,170
嗯, 屋頂上可能有人
Well, there might be guys on the roof.

993
00:58:32,172 --> 00:58:33,438
什麼意思, 屋頂有人?
What do you mean, guys on the roof?

994
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,505
這TMD是怎麼回事?
What the fuck is going on?

995
00:58:34,507 --> 00:58:36,274
什麼 你有槍?
And what, you got a gun?

996
00:58:36,276 --> 00:58:38,376
這是CBS新聞特別報道
This is CBS news special report.

997
00:58:38,378 --> 00:58:40,144
阿波羅8號飛船
The flight of Apollo 8.

998
00:58:40,146 --> 00:58:41,712
六天時間來回月球
Six days to the moon and back.

999
00:58:41,714 --> 00:58:44,115
Walter Cronkite為您報道
Brought to you by Walter Cronkite.

1000
00:58:44,117 --> 00:58:47,118
阿波羅8號的飛行已經結束
The flight of Apollo 8 is over.

1001
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,655
剩下的只是把宇航員從太空艙中移出
And all that remains is to remove the astronauts from the space craft,

1002
00:58:50,657 --> 00:58:52,790
送到三公里外的
and carry them less than two miles

1003
00:58:52,792 --> 00:58:55,827
約克城號航空母艦的甲板上
to the deck of the carrier Yorktown.

1004
00:58:55,829 --> 00:58:58,663
太空任務的未來計劃, 當然
Future plans for space missions, of course,

1005
00:58:58,665 --> 00:59:01,365
已經顯著提速了
have been accelerated considerably.

1006
00:59:01,367 --> 00:59:03,801
意味著他們能夠
It means that they can keep to the hoped-for

1007
00:59:03,803 --> 00:59:08,673
在二月底或三月初
schedule of the next Apollo 9 mission,

1008
00:59:08,675 --> 00:59:11,275
按計劃執行阿波羅9號任務
late in February, or early in march,

1009
00:59:11,277 --> 00:59:13,744
以便測試登陸模塊
to test out the landing module,

1010
00:59:13,746 --> 00:59:17,348
然後直到載人登月
and, uh, then move on towards landing a man on the moon

1011
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:20,351
七月中旬還有兩次飛行
two flights further on in the middle of July.

1012
00:59:22,287 --> 00:59:26,257
我們有一個消息和一個壞消息
So we've got good news and bad news.

1013
00:59:26,259 --> 00:59:30,795
好消息, 他的名字叫Antonin Lhotsky
Good news, his name is Antonin Lhotsky.

1014
00:59:30,797 --> 00:59:33,464
嗯. - 他是名克格勃特工
Uh-huh. - He's a KGB agent.

1015
00:59:33,466 --> 00:59:35,433
他就是那天晚上在工作室外頭那人
He's the man from outside the studio the other night.

1016
00:59:35,435 --> 00:59:37,301
哇, 什麼?
Whoa, what?

1017
00:59:37,303 --> 00:59:39,570
我們懷疑他一直就是那個鼴鼠
We suspect he's been the mole the entire time.

1018
00:59:39,572 --> 00:59:42,473
所以...所以他知道雪崩行動. 我們完蛋了!
So... so then he knows about avalanche. We're fucked!

1019
00:59:42,475 --> 00:59:44,408
我們覺得他並不知道
We don't think he does.

1020
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:46,177
這幾天我們一直在審問他
We've been interrogating him for the past couple of days.

1021
00:59:46,179 --> 00:59:47,378
看起來他什麼都不知道
He doesn't seem to know anything.

1022
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:49,814
我們突擊搜查了他的房子. 啥都沒有
We've raided his house. Nothing.

1023
00:59:49,816 --> 00:59:52,483
這人就是鼴鼠? 你們...你們抓到他了?
This guy's the mole? And you... you got him?

1024
00:59:52,485 --> 00:59:53,918
我們抓到他了
We got him.

1025
00:59:54,853 --> 00:59:59,657
然後怎麼? 我們才剛剛...
So, then what? We're just...

1026
00:59:59,659 --> 01:00:00,758
那我們沒事?
We're good?

1027
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,627
嗯, 有一點
Well, not entirely.

1028
01:00:02,629 --> 01:00:06,531
我們, 額, 收到了新的情報, 蘇聯方面的進展
We, uh, got some new intel on the Soviet progress,

1029
01:00:06,533 --> 01:00:09,700
說明他們做得比我們原想的要好
and it turns out they're doing better than we thought.

1030
01:00:09,702 --> 01:00:14,805
看起來他們有可能在'69年底登月
It looks like they could possibly make it to the moon by the end of '69.

1031
01:00:14,807 --> 01:00:19,177
意味著我們最晚在四月份要全部做完
Which means that we need to be done by April at the latest.

1032
01:00:20,546 --> 01:00:23,581
這讓我們的時間非常緊迫
Yeah, that puts us on a pretty tight timeline.

1033
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:25,416
他們知道我們在這
They know we're here.

1034
01:00:25,418 --> 01:00:27,318
我們可以在這, 好吧? 放鬆
We're allowed to be here, okay? Relax.

1035
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,953
嗨
Hi.

1036
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,761
追, 追, 追, 追!
Go, go, go, go!

1037
01:00:38,564 --> 01:00:40,731
Jared, 上車!
Jared, get in the car!

1038
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:09,427
喂? Matt, 我們碰到麻煩了
Hello? Matt, we have a problem here.

1039
01:01:12,232 --> 01:01:16,601
有合同的人, 我不知道, 有的人
Gentleman got the contract with, I don't know, somebody.

1040
01:01:16,603 --> 01:01:18,936
這是他們說是鼴鼠的那個人
This is who they say the mole was.

1041
01:01:18,938 --> 01:01:21,505
我們採訪過他?
So we interviewed him?

1042
01:01:21,507 --> 01:01:24,942
是, 一年多前
Yeah, over a year ago.

1043
01:01:24,944 --> 01:01:28,012
記不記得你曾經讓我查過是誰給Webb打的電話?
Remember when you asked me to find out who was on the phone with Webb?

1044
01:01:28,014 --> 01:01:29,413
當然
Of course.

1045
01:01:29,415 --> 01:01:31,549
我記得
I did.

1046
01:01:31,551 --> 01:01:33,517
...秒降到月球表面
...second burn to the lunar surface.

1047
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:35,786
然後我們可以進去...250
Then we can go in after...For 250.

1048
01:01:35,788 --> 01:01:38,256
我們只能做到250秒?
250 seconds is all we can do?

1049
01:01:38,258 --> 01:01:40,591
那是最大值. 你知不知道...
That's the maximum, and you know that...

1050
01:01:40,593 --> 01:01:42,627
你有沒和TRW討論過?
Did you talk to TRW?

1051
01:01:42,629 --> 01:01:45,796
是. 你知道他們的燃料的情況
Yeah. And you know how they are about their fuels.

1052
01:01:45,798 --> 01:01:47,531
所以我們有麻煩了...Grumman...
So we are in trouble...Grumman...

1053
01:01:49,302 --> 01:01:50,668
這什麼意思?
What does this mean?

1054
01:01:52,738 --> 01:01:57,008
所以鼴鼠知道我們登不了月
So the mole knew that we couldn't make it to the moon

1055
01:01:57,010 --> 01:02:00,344
一年多了?
for over a year?

1056
01:02:00,346 --> 01:02:02,647
我覺得不是
I don't think so.

1057
01:02:02,649 --> 01:02:04,715
我覺得Lhotsky不是那個鼴鼠
I don't think that Lhotsky's the mole,

1058
01:02:04,717 --> 01:02:08,419
我覺得工作室外頭那人不是Lhotsky
I don't think Lhotsky was outside the studio.

1059
01:02:08,421 --> 01:02:10,621
我的意思是, Lhotsky知道我們登不了月
I mean, Lhotsky knows that we can't make it to the moon,

1060
01:02:10,623 --> 01:02:12,023
所以也許他們...他不配合
so maybe they...He wouldn't cooperate

1061
01:02:12,025 --> 01:02:14,325
然後他們只好把他弄成替罪羊
and they had to make him a fall guy

1062
01:02:14,327 --> 01:02:15,426
說他就是那個鼴鼠
by saying that he's the mole.

1063
01:02:15,428 --> 01:02:16,494
他們?
They?

1064
01:02:17,663 --> 01:02:18,929
對
Yeah.

1065
01:02:18,931 --> 01:02:21,866
什麼意思? 中情局
What do you mean? The CIA.

1066
01:02:21,868 --> 01:02:25,736
好, 那麼, 在工作室外頭跟蹤我們的人是誰?
Okay, well then, who's outside the studio following us?

1067
01:02:25,738 --> 01:02:27,672
CIA特工
CIA agents.

1068
01:02:27,674 --> 01:02:30,641
所以boles沒對他們開槍
That's why boles didn't shoot them.

1069
01:02:30,643 --> 01:02:32,310
他們是一夥的
They're all working together.

1070
01:02:32,312 --> 01:02:34,779
他們全都在監視我們, 他們騙我們
They're all watching us, and they're lying to us.

1071
01:02:34,781 --> 01:02:36,347
為什麼? 有什麼目的?
For what? For what purpose?

1072
01:02:36,349 --> 01:02:37,615
我們做的一切他們全都知道
They know everything that we're doing.

1073
01:02:37,617 --> 01:02:39,884
為什麼...完全沒道理
Why... This doesn't make any sense.

1074
01:02:39,886 --> 01:02:42,820
他們沒理由跟蹤我們
There's no reason for them to be following us.

1075
01:02:42,822 --> 01:02:44,555
你...你有沒有...
You... have you...

1076
01:02:44,557 --> 01:02:47,525
以前你有沒有聽過陰謀論?
Have you heard of a conspiracy theory before?

1077
01:02:47,527 --> 01:02:49,527
有
Yeah.

1078
01:02:49,529 --> 01:02:51,395
我覺得我們現在就在裏頭
I think we're in one.

1079
01:03:52,124 --> 01:03:54,058
好, 伸腿!
Okay, leg out!

1080
01:03:55,428 --> 01:03:56,660
看起來不夠真實
That doesn't look real.

1081
01:03:56,662 --> 01:03:58,028
好, 知道我們該怎麼做嗎?
Okay, you know what we'll do?

1082
01:03:58,030 --> 01:04:00,731
數三下跳下來. 準備好了?
Jump on the count of three. Ready?

1083
01:04:00,733 --> 01:04:01,966
我會帶來反彈
I'm bringing the bounce in.

1084
01:04:01,968 --> 01:04:03,834
太高了
That's a big jump.

1085
01:04:03,836 --> 01:04:05,436
快, 你是Neil Armstrong
Come on, you're supposed to be Neil Armstrong.

1086
01:04:05,438 --> 01:04:06,570
他很勇敢. 準備好了?
He's brave. Ready?

1087
01:04:06,572 --> 01:04:08,506
開始
There we go.

1088
01:04:11,176 --> 01:04:13,511
額, 換個背景
Uh, change the background.

1089
01:04:17,082 --> 01:04:18,849
再換一個
One more.

1090
01:04:20,919 --> 01:04:21,986
這個怎麼樣?
How about that?

1091
01:04:21,988 --> 01:04:23,888
棒
Great.

1092
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:25,990
很棒
That's great.

1093
01:04:25,992 --> 01:04:27,792
我們在他頭盔的反射裏頭拍到了啥?
What are we getting in the reflection of his helmet?

1094
01:04:27,794 --> 01:04:29,160
我在不在裏面?
Am I in it?

1095
01:04:29,162 --> 01:04:30,628
我們必須在後面替換掉
We'll have to replace that after.

1096
01:04:42,707 --> 01:04:44,708
看起來很棒. 你只要...
That looks great. And then you just...

1097
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:46,477
我們必須按住這
We have to repress this.

1098
01:04:46,479 --> 01:04:47,845
放到動畫板上重拍
Put that on an animation stand and reshoot it.

1099
01:04:47,847 --> 01:04:50,514
這個是原版
This is the original from the sound stage.

1100
01:04:50,516 --> 01:04:52,550
然後加上環形山的紋理
And the crater textures are added after.

1101
01:04:52,552 --> 01:04:54,852
在工作室裏去除掉細節
Getting rid of the details in the studio.

1102
01:04:54,854 --> 01:04:57,588
你進去然後你用印刷油墨把這些區域塗黑
You go in and you black out the areas with litho ink.

1103
01:04:57,590 --> 01:05:00,191
讓我們把這個移下一點
Let's move this a little bit further down,

1104
01:05:00,193 --> 01:05:02,893
因為看起來有點太過直角了
because it seems a little too square.

1105
01:05:02,895 --> 01:05:04,495
和鏡頭成直角? 是
Square to camera? Yeah.

1106
01:05:04,497 --> 01:05:05,563
好
Sure.

1107
01:05:10,735 --> 01:05:12,169
哇
Wow.

1108
01:05:24,883 --> 01:05:28,152
好了? 很好. 好, 開始
Ready? That's good. Yeah, go.

1109
01:05:28,154 --> 01:05:30,621
成功了
It works.

1110
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,922
Yes!
Yes!

1111
01:05:34,092 --> 01:05:35,192
太神奇了! 再來一遍
This is amazing! Go again.

1112
01:05:35,194 --> 01:05:37,828
Matt. 嗯?
Matt. Yes?

1113
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:39,230
看到這個沒有? 看到這個沒有?
Have you seen this? Have you seen this?

1114
01:05:39,232 --> 01:05:42,500
再來一遍! 再來一遍! Owen, 看, 看
Do it again! Do it again! Owen, look, look.

1115
01:05:42,502 --> 01:05:44,268
鎯頭, 羽毛
Hammer, feather.

1116
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:46,537
落! 伽利略是對的
Drop! Galileo was right.

1117
01:05:46,539 --> 01:05:49,874
帥哥, 我在裏頭加在重量. 什麼?
Dude, I just put a weight in it. What?

1118
01:05:49,876 --> 01:05:52,643
"NASA科學家死了"
"NASA scientist dies."

1119
01:05:52,645 --> 01:05:54,144
今天早上的報紙
It's from this morning's paper.

1120
01:05:56,548 --> 01:05:59,550
搞啥...Matt, 是Lhotsky
Well, what the...Matt, it's Lhotsky.

1121
01:05:59,552 --> 01:06:00,784
什麼?
What?

1122
01:06:00,786 --> 01:06:02,953
Boles, 他肯定知道
Boles, he must've known about it.

1123
01:06:04,189 --> 01:06:05,990
聽著, 想想Lhotsky為什麼會死
Listen, think why Lhotsky's dead.

1124
01:06:05,992 --> 01:06:07,858
顯然, 是他在和Webb說話, 所以他們啥了他
Obviously, he was talking to Webb, so they killed him.

1125
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:09,860
他們會殺了我...
They're going to kill me...

1126
01:06:09,862 --> 01:06:11,896
我們不知道那人為什麼死了. 不, 我們知道
We don't know why that guy's dead. Yes, we do.

1127
01:06:11,898 --> 01:06:14,031
他們會啥了我? 你在說什麼?
They're going to kill me? What are you talking about?

1128
01:06:14,033 --> 01:06:15,699
他們會把我們都殺了. 他們會殺了宇航員
They're going to kill us both, they're going to kill the astronauts.

1129
01:06:15,701 --> 01:06:17,935
我肯定...任何知道這事的人
I'm sure... Anyone who knows about this.

1130
01:06:17,937 --> 01:06:20,304
我肯定Lhotsky知道得太多了所以他們把他幹掉了. 就是這樣
I'm sure Lhotsky knew too much and so they got rid of him. Okay? That's it.

1131
01:06:20,306 --> 01:06:22,940
對! 對! 我說的就是這個!
Right! Right! That's what I'm talking about!

1132
01:06:22,942 --> 01:06:25,576
他就是那個鼴鼠, 好嗎?
He was the mole, okay?

1133
01:06:25,578 --> 01:06:28,612
不...他們在把東西串起來
No... no, they're tying off loose ends!

1134
01:06:28,614 --> 01:06:30,614
好, 那其他還有誰會死, 啊?
Yeah, and, so, who else is gonna die, huh?

1135
01:06:30,616 --> 01:06:33,551
他們會殺了Jim Webb? NASA的頭? 他也知道!
They're gonna kill Jim Webb? The head of NASA? He knows, too!

1136
01:06:33,553 --> 01:06:35,819
有可能. 有可能. 你不覺得他們會?
Maybe. Maybe. You don't think they would?

1137
01:06:35,821 --> 01:06:39,790
不! 好了, 穿上宇航服準備好, 行嗎? 閉嘴吧你
No! Okay, put the suit on and get ready, all right? Shut the fuck up.

1138
01:06:54,974 --> 01:06:59,577
有團東西在...在玻璃上. Owen, 你能擦掉嗎?
There's a glob of something on the...on the glass. Owen, could you get it?

1139
01:06:59,579 --> 01:07:02,646
不, 就在...你沒擦掉. 就在那兒
No, it's right... You didn't get it. It's right there.

1140
01:07:02,648 --> 01:07:05,249
就在, 就在那
Right, right there.

1141
01:07:05,251 --> 01:07:07,918
你...你在做什麼? 這只是個測試
What... What are you doing? It's just a test.

1142
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,954
Boles, 我不接受你的命令!
Boles, I don't take orders from you!

1143
01:07:09,956 --> 01:07:12,122
- 哦, 真的? - 好了, 過來
- Oh, really? - Enough, come on.

1144
01:07:12,124 --> 01:07:14,758
是, 有人會讓我們被殺掉. 我不要接受他的命令
Yeah, I don't take orders from someone who's trying to get us killed.

1145
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,627
Owen, Owen, Owen. 另扔了
Owen, Owen, Owen. Don't drop it.

1146
01:07:16,629 --> 01:07:17,861
他放他們走的. 不, 他沒有...
He let them get away. No, he didn't...

1147
01:07:17,863 --> 01:07:19,363
對不對? 他放他們走的!
Right? He let them get away!

1148
01:07:19,365 --> 01:07:21,165
你就是那麼做的. 哦, 真的?
That's what you did. Oh, really?

1149
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:23,200
- 對, 你故意錯過的! - 嗨, 哇, 哇, 哇!
- Yes, you missed on purpose! - Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1150
01:07:23,202 --> 01:07:25,769
你...你在幹什麼? 你在幹什麼? 我們是朋友
What... what are you doing? What are you doing? We're friends.

1151
01:07:25,771 --> 01:07:27,304
他們是誰? 我們是朋友
Who are they? We're friends.

1152
01:07:27,306 --> 01:07:30,341
他們是誰? 是不是Brackett? 中情局?
Who are they? Is it Brackett? The CIA?

1153
01:07:30,343 --> 01:07:32,810
為什麼你不告訴他你每天都怎麼在一直給Barckett打電話
Why don't you tell him about how you've been calling Brackett every day,

1154
01:07:32,812 --> 01:07:36,647
想讓Johnson總統扔掉這個任務. 告訴他!
trying to get Johnson thrown off the mission. Tell him that!

1155
01:07:36,649 --> 01:07:38,916
你在說什麼? 嗨, 問你的朋友
What are you talking about? Hey, ask your friend.

1156
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,623
好, 等等
Okay, hold on.

1157
01:07:45,625 --> 01:07:48,192
告訴他. 告訴他
Tell him. Tell him.

1158
01:08:06,211 --> 01:08:08,812
我們決定登月
We choose to go to the moon.

1159
01:08:08,814 --> 01:08:10,781
我們決定登月
We choose to go to the moon.

1160
01:08:17,188 --> 01:08:19,757
我們決定在這個年代登月
We choose to go to the moon in this decade

1161
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:21,759
以及成就其他
and do the other things.

1162
01:08:21,761 --> 01:08:25,262
不是因為它們輕而易舉，而是因為它們困難重重
Not because they are easy, but because they are hard.

1163
01:08:25,264 --> 01:08:29,333
因為這個目標能夠組織和檢驗
Because that goal will serve to organize and measure

1164
01:08:29,335 --> 01:08:33,037
我們最強的能量和技術
the best of our energies and skills.

1165
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:36,840
因為這項挑戰我們願意接受
Because that challenge is one that we're willing to accept.

1166
01:08:36,842 --> 01:08:42,713
我們不願推後, 我們決戰決勝, 其他也是一樣
One we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win, and the others, too.

1167
01:08:49,921 --> 01:08:52,089
我們將把火箭發射到
We shall send to the moon,

1168
01:08:52,091 --> 01:08:57,861
和休斯頓控制室相距38萬公里的月球上
240,000 miles away from the control station in Houston,

1169
01:08:57,863 --> 01:09:00,030
一枚巨型火箭
a giant rocket,

1170
01:09:00,032 --> 01:09:04,702
高度將近100米, 相當於這個橄欖球場的長度
more than 300 feet tall, the length of this football field,

1171
01:09:04,704 --> 01:09:09,473
採用新合金來製造, 其中有些還沒被開發出來
made of new metal alloys, some of which have not yet been invented,

1172
01:09:09,475 --> 01:09:12,443
能夠承受的溫度和壓力
capable of standing heat and stresses

1173
01:09:12,445 --> 01:09:16,046
數倍於現有材料
several times more than have ever been experienced,

1174
01:09:16,048 --> 01:09:18,415
這項任務前無古人
on an untried mission

1175
01:09:18,417 --> 01:09:20,918
這個天體並不熟知
to an unknown celestial body,

1176
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:24,221
然後我們還要從那裏安全地返回地球
and then return it safely to earth,

1177
01:09:24,223 --> 01:09:29,093
以超過4萬公里的時速重回大氣層
re-entering the atmosphere at speeds of over 25,000 miles per hour,

1178
01:09:29,095 --> 01:09:33,230
要做到所有這一切...做到所有這一切而且準確無誤
and do all this... And do all this and do it right,

1179
01:09:33,232 --> 01:09:36,500
而且要第一個做到, 在這個年代結束之前
and do it first, before this decade is out,

1180
01:09:36,502 --> 01:09:38,435
我們必須勇敢無畏
then we must be bold.

1181
01:09:41,474 --> 01:09:43,974
所以, 在我們啟航的時候,
And therefore, as we set sail,

1182
01:09:43,976 --> 01:09:48,479
我們請求上帝保佑這個人類有史以來所進行的
we ask god's blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous

1183
01:09:48,481 --> 01:09:51,982
最艱難的, 最危險的, 也是最偉大的探險
and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked.

1184
01:09:51,984 --> 01:09:53,317
謝謝
Thank you.

1185
01:10:14,806 --> 01:10:16,774
這是唯一的拷貝?
So this is the only copy?

1186
01:10:16,776 --> 01:10:21,078
是. 那, 現在怎樣? 我們就這麼拿去給Brackett?
Yeah. So, now what? We just bring it to Brackett?

1187
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:23,981
哦, 我來拿給Brackett. 你留在這收拾乾淨
Oh, I'll take it to Brackett. You stay here and clean up.

1188
01:10:24,916 --> 01:10:26,483
收拾乾淨啥?
Clean up what?

1189
01:10:26,485 --> 01:10:29,419
收拾乾淨工作室. 銷毀全部東西
Clean up the studio. Destroy everything.

1190
01:10:31,556 --> 01:10:33,223
萬一我們...萬一我們還需要這些材料的話怎麼辦?
What if we... What if we need that stuff?

1191
01:10:33,225 --> 01:10:36,393
不會. 幹得不錯
We won't. Good work.

1192
01:10:36,395 --> 01:10:39,396
謝謝. 我會很快見你
Thanks. I'll see you soon.

1193
01:10:39,398 --> 01:10:43,801
- 嗨, boles. - Lhotsky不是那個鼴鼠, 對不對?
- Hey, boles. - Lhotsky wasn't the mole, was he?

1194
01:10:50,275 --> 01:10:52,476
你在說什麼?
What are you talking about?

1195
01:10:55,413 --> 01:10:58,048
是, 我不...
Yeah, I don't...

1196
01:10:58,050 --> 01:10:59,583
我不知道
I don't know.

1197
01:10:59,585 --> 01:11:02,419
我做這個太久了. 對不起
I've been working on this too long. I'm sorry.

1198
01:11:02,421 --> 01:11:04,488
嗯, 休息一下
Well, get some rest.

1199
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:06,190
我會很快見你
I'll see you soon.

1200
01:11:06,192 --> 01:11:08,192
再見, 兄弟
Bye, buddy.

1201
01:12:14,994 --> 01:12:19,563
他一眼就能認出火箭科學家是我們的人假扮的
He's gonna spot one of our guys pretending to be a rocket scientist instantly.

1202
01:12:19,565 --> 01:12:24,134
我們得派些人看起來完全不知道發生了什麼事情
We need to send people who are gonna look like they have no idea what's going on.

1203
01:12:35,514 --> 01:12:37,514
他們登不了月
They can't make it to the moon.

1204
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:41,385
我會告訴你他們說了啥的
I'm gonna tell you what they said.

1205
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:50,093
心裏一點都不愧疚麼?
An ethical problem with this at all?

1206
01:13:00,272 --> 01:13:02,239
他放他們走的! 你就是那麼做的. 哦, 真的?
He let them get away! That's what you did. Oh, really?

1207
01:13:02,241 --> 01:13:04,174
對, 你故意錯過的!
Yes, you missed on purpose!

1208
01:13:04,176 --> 01:13:06,109
嗨, 哇, 哇, 哇! 你...你在幹什麼?
Hey whoa, whoa, whoa! What... what are you doing?

1209
01:13:06,111 --> 01:13:07,644
你在幹什麼? 我們是朋友
What are you doing? We're friends!

1210
01:13:07,646 --> 01:13:09,680
- 他們是誰? - 我們是朋友
- Who are they? - We're friends.

1211
01:13:12,717 --> 01:13:15,118
什麼, 你覺得那是你朋友? 誰, Brackett?
What, you think that's your friend? Who, Brackett?

1212
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,254
中情局? 你為什麼不告訴他...
The CIA? Why don't you tell him about how...

1213
01:14:03,602 --> 01:14:06,770
嗨, Julie. 能把你丈夫借給我一下麼?
Hey, Julie. Can I borrow your husband?

1214
01:14:09,273 --> 01:14:13,710
他啥? Simon在睡覺. 在裏面
He what? Simon's asleep. Inside.

1215
01:14:13,712 --> 01:14:15,712
我可以去裏面, 你們好聊聊
I can go inside so you guys can talk.

1216
01:14:15,714 --> 01:14:17,547
你可以留在外面
You can stay outside.

1217
01:14:17,549 --> 01:14:21,084
不, 我不需要聊聊. 我想知道是不是...
No, I don't need to talk. I wanna know if, um...

1218
01:14:21,086 --> 01:14:25,355
你是不是打算...我們...我們去把那些材料從工作中去掉
If you wanna... we're... We're going to get rid of the stuff from work.

1219
01:14:27,658 --> 01:14:30,360
你想的話你可以去
You can go if you want.

1220
01:14:30,362 --> 01:14:32,329
不, 我要待在這
No, I'm going to stay here.

1221
01:14:36,067 --> 01:14:38,769
Simon怎麼樣? 這次的發射你們興不興奮?
How's Simon? Are you guys excited about the big launch?

1222
01:14:42,573 --> 01:14:46,276
好. 祝你們下午愉快
Okay. Have a good afternoon.

1223
01:14:46,278 --> 01:14:48,178
謝謝. 你也一樣. 我會很快再見你
Thanks. You, too. I'll see you soon, okay?

1224
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:49,413
是. 再見
Yeah, bye.

1225
01:15:02,326 --> 01:15:04,561
早上好
Good morning.

1226
01:15:04,563 --> 01:15:08,832
距離發射還有1小時29分鐘53秒. 倒數正在進行
It's t-minus one hour, 29 minutes and 53 seconds and counting.

1227
01:15:08,834 --> 01:15:13,136
還有一個半小時, 如果一切順利的話, 阿波羅11號的宇航員
In just an hour and a half, if all goes well, Apollo eleven astronauts,

1228
01:15:13,138 --> 01:15:15,338
Armstrong, Aldrin 和 Collins
Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins

1229
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:18,675
將從外面的39A平台發射升空
are to lift off from pad 39-a out there

1230
01:15:18,677 --> 01:15:22,112
踏上人類一直的夢想旅程
on the voyage man always has dreamed about.

1231
01:15:22,114 --> 01:15:24,815
他們的下一站, 月球
Next stop for them, the moon.

1232
01:15:24,817 --> 01:15:27,451
我們將親眼見證肯尼迪總統
And we are all about to witness the fulfillment

1233
01:15:27,453 --> 01:15:30,253
於1962年9月12日在德克薩斯州賴斯大學體育館
of that promise that president Kennedy made

1234
01:15:30,255 --> 01:15:36,159
許下的諾言變成現實
at rice university stadium in Texas, on September 12, 1962.

1235
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:38,361
凌晨4點, 當我們到達一號門區域的時候
We passed 10,000 odd cars

1236
01:15:38,363 --> 01:15:41,131
那裏停泊的車輛有上萬台
parked around the gate-1 area at 4:00 A.M. when we got here.

1237
01:15:41,133 --> 01:15:44,534
車輛來自各個州份, 車裏的孩子們都瞪大了雙眼,
Cars from every state, with little kids staring wide-eyed,

1238
01:15:44,536 --> 01:15:47,804
我們看見年輕人們都手拿著望遠鏡
and we saw teenagers with telescopes.

1239
01:15:47,806 --> 01:15:50,540
對我來說這個場景非常感人, 因為
It was a very moving scene for me, because

1240
01:15:50,542 --> 01:15:53,743
美國人民以前關心, 我覺得, 現在也關心
Americans cared then, I think, and they care now.

1241
01:15:53,745 --> 01:15:57,681
沙地上寫著, "祝你好運, 阿波羅11號"
And it says, "good luck, Apollo 11" engraved in the sand.

1242
01:15:57,683 --> 01:16:01,785
這裏的倒數進行得非常順利
All going very smoothly here with the count.

1243
01:16:01,787 --> 01:16:03,854
倒數60秒
T-minus 60 seconds and counting.

1244
01:16:03,856 --> 01:16:07,457
我們已進入60秒倒計時. 電力傳輸已經完成
We've passed t-minus 60. Power transfer is complete.

1245
01:16:11,529 --> 01:16:14,631
12, 11, 10, 9...
Twelve, eleven, ten, nine...

1246
01:16:14,633 --> 01:16:17,334
點火序列啟動
Ignition sequence starts.

1247
01:16:17,336 --> 01:16:22,873
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Six, five, four, three, two, one.

1248
01:16:50,701 --> 01:16:54,204
下午好. 這裏是美國廣播公司位於紐約的太空總部
And good afternoon from ABC space headquarters in New York.

1249
01:16:54,206 --> 01:16:57,674
和我在一起的是我們的科學編輯, Jules Bergman. 今天我們在直播間
With me is our science editor, Jules Bergman and we are on the air today

1250
01:16:57,676 --> 01:17:01,611
為您報道由阿波羅11號執行的
to bring you a complete report on some very, very important maneuvers

1251
01:17:01,613 --> 01:17:03,713
非常非常重要的行動
to be performed by Apollo 11.

1252
01:17:03,715 --> 01:17:05,282
基本上開始進行...
Basically a position to begin the process...

1253
01:17:05,284 --> 01:17:06,383
喂?
Hello?

你在...你在不在看這個?
Are you... Are you seeing this right now?

1256
01:17:10,222 --> 01:17:12,622
- Matt, 他們沒死. - 中情局在騙我們
- Matt, they're not dead. - The CIA lied to us.

1257
01:17:12,624 --> 01:17:14,858
等等, 什麼?
Wait, what?

1258
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:17,494
在工作室外頭跟蹤我們的那些人, 他們在我家外面
The men following us at the studio are outside my house.

1259
01:17:17,496 --> 01:17:19,863
你確信? 是, 我去你旅店
Are you sure? Yes, meet me at your motel.

1260
01:17:27,638 --> 01:17:29,773

What the hell?

1261
01:17:32,744 --> 01:17:34,811

誰在那?
Who's there?

1264
01:17:55,434 --> 01:17:56,733

Oh, shit.

好, 好, 好
Okay, okay, okay.

另一台車在哪? 另一台...
Where's the other car? Where's the...

1268
01:18:10,649 --> 01:18:12,749

Um, um, out back. Out back.

1269
01:18:22,561 --> 01:18:24,661
好, 讓開
Okay, stand back.

1270
01:18:47,552 --> 01:18:49,586
對不起
Sorry.

1271
01:18:49,588 --> 01:18:51,521
今天有一種躁狂的熱情...
There is a delirium of enthusiasm today...

1272
01:18:56,594 --> 01:18:58,361
快接

Get their faces! Get their faces, Andy! Get their faces!

1284
01:20:25,984 --> 01:20:27,851
TMD瘋了!
This is fucking crazy!

1285
01:20:33,924 --> 01:20:36,693
天吶! 老天!
Oh, god! Oh, Christ!

1286
01:20:41,532 --> 01:20:43,433
他有槍! 什麼?
He's got a gun! What?

1287
01:20:43,435 --> 01:20:45,902
- TMD有槍. - 快, 躲, 躲, 躲
- He's got a fucking gun. - Okay, duck, duck, duck!

1288
01:20:53,078 --> 01:20:54,611
混蛋

01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:14,431
操, 操!
Oh, fuck. Fuck!

1291
01:21:23,108 --> 01:21:24,674
好了, 好了
Okay, okay.

1292
01:21:31,549 --> 01:21:33,616
離開這裏. 離開這裏.
Get out of here. Get out of here.

1293
01:21:33,618 --> 01:21:34,818
我在試. 離開這裏.
I'm trying. Get out of here.

1294
01:21:36,954 --> 01:21:38,455
老大, 他們就在我們前面
Dude, they're right in front of us.

1295
01:21:38,457 --> 01:21:39,722
是, 我知道
Yeah, I know.

1296
01:21:45,797 --> 01:21:47,477
他們想撞我們, 他們想撞我們!
They're gonna ram us, they're gonna ram us!

1297
01:21:54,572 --> 01:21:56,239
歐!
Oh!

Owen!
Owen!

1303
01:24:58,789 --> 01:25:00,957
它們有的沒貼標籤, 是不是?
So they're not all labeled, right?

1304
01:25:00,959 --> 01:25:05,361
有'67, '68, '69. 但不是全部...不是全部都有標
It goes '67, '68, '69. But not everything's... Not everything's marked.

1305
01:25:05,363 --> 01:25:07,830
你會找出來的
Well, you'll figure it out.

1306
01:25:07,832 --> 01:25:09,332
嗨
Hey.

1307
01:25:16,907 --> 01:25:19,008
好的
Okay, man.

1308
01:25:19,010 --> 01:25:21,044
我一知道我們去哪, 我就給你電話
As soon as I know where we're going, I'll call you.

1309
01:25:21,046 --> 01:25:22,245
好
Yeah.

1310
01:26:47,831 --> 01:26:49,832
晚上好
Good evening.

1311
01:26:49,834 --> 01:26:52,168
你好, 酒吧盡頭有個戴眼鏡的男的
Hello, there's a man at the end of the bar wearing glasses.

1312
01:26:52,170 --> 01:26:54,437
能不能叫他來聽電話?
Could you please give the phone to him?

1313
01:26:58,776 --> 01:27:00,810
您的電話
Telephone.

1314
01:27:05,783 --> 01:27:07,483
喂?
Hello?

1315
01:27:07,485 --> 01:27:09,919
你真的是個垃圾, 你知不知道?
You're a real piece of shit, you know that?

1316
01:27:13,957 --> 01:27:16,125
我們一直在找你. 你去哪了?
We're looking for you. Where you been?

1317
01:27:16,127 --> 01:27:18,060
我來告訴你. 我們來做的交易
Yeah, I'll tell you what, let's make a trade.

1318
01:27:19,797 --> 01:27:21,364
好
Okay.

1319
01:27:21,366 --> 01:27:24,133
在你要暗殺的特工名單上我的位置
My location for the names of the agents on your kill team.

1320
01:27:26,203 --> 01:27:28,070
我們沒有什麼暗殺名單
We don't have any kill team.

1321
01:27:28,072 --> 01:27:31,307
好, 那是誰殺的Owen把他吊死在車庫裏頭?
Yeah, well, who killed Owen and hung him in his garage?

1322
01:27:34,344 --> 01:27:38,381
好. 下來辦公室. 我們需要談談
Okay. Come down to the office. We'll discuss it.

1323
01:27:38,383 --> 01:27:40,283
好. 我會進來.
Yeah, I'll come in.

1324
01:27:40,285 --> 01:27:41,884
不, 我來告訴你會發生什麼事
No, I'll tell you what's gonna happen.

1325
01:27:41,886 --> 01:27:44,120
我把我們做的一切全都拍下來了
I have a film of everything we did.

1326
01:27:44,122 --> 01:27:47,390
我有中情局密謀假造登月的證據
I have proof that the CIA conspired to fake the moon landing

1327
01:27:47,392 --> 01:27:50,860
Owen Williams就是那個每個人都將看到的在月亮上行走的人
and that Owen Williams is the one that everybody is about to see walk on the moon.

1328
01:27:50,862 --> 01:27:53,896
你為了保密就把他殺了
And that you killed him to keep it a secret.

1329
01:27:53,898 --> 01:27:55,865
我還有拍到你計劃北木行動
I even got you planning Northwoods,

1330
01:27:55,867 --> 01:27:58,000
就跟我現在有拍到你一樣
the same as I got you right now.

1331
01:28:06,009 --> 01:28:08,077
沒人會把這個當真的, 小朋友
No one will take that seriously, kid.

1332
01:28:08,079 --> 01:28:10,146
好, 說我信口胡扯
Yeah, well, call my bluff.

1333
01:28:10,148 --> 01:28:13,449
我最後的影片會讓世人相信我們去了月亮
My last movie's about to convince the world we went to the moon.

1334
01:28:13,451 --> 01:28:16,886
那為什麼我不和你做個交易?
Then why don't I make you a deal?

1335
01:28:16,888 --> 01:28:18,521
回來為我們干
Come back and work for us,

1336
01:28:18,523 --> 01:28:22,525
我會讓你當你自己部門的頭
and I'll make you the head of your own department.

1337
01:28:25,096 --> 01:28:29,532
你以為我是有多愚蠢?
Yeah, how stupid do you think I am?

1338
01:28:32,904 --> 01:28:35,304
我來告訴你
I'll tell you what.

1339
01:28:35,306 --> 01:28:39,609
把影片作為要挾, 如果你不信我的話. 還是想想我的提議
Keep the film as collateral if you don't believe me. Just think about it.

1340
01:29:24,988 --> 01:29:29,058
逐漸靠近的時候
The surface appears to be, uh,

1341
01:29:29,060 --> 01:29:32,929
表面顯得非常非常細膩
very, very fine grained as you get close to it.

1342
01:29:32,931 --> 01:29:35,131
幾乎就跟粉末一樣
It's almost like a powder.

1343
01:29:35,133 --> 01:29:38,334
下面, 嗯, 非常細膩
Down there, uh, is very fine.

1344
01:29:40,137 --> 01:29:42,705
好, 現在我準備走出登月艙
Okay, I'm going to step off the LM now.

1345
01:29:48,412 --> 01:29:51,614
對一個人來說是一小步,
That's one small step for man,

1346
01:29:53,350 --> 01:29:57,253
對人類而言是一大步
one giant leap for mankind.

1347
01:30:08,966 --> 01:30:14,036
表面很精細, 全是粉塵
And the, uh, the surface is fine and powdery.

1348
01:30:14,038 --> 01:30:18,474
我可以...我可以用腳趾把它鬆散地撿起來
I can... I can pick it up loosely with my toe.

1349
01:30:18,476 --> 01:30:21,444
它們堆成...
It does adhere in fine...

1350
01:32:58,136 --> 01:33:00,169
好, 在地球升起來之前
Okay, we shouldn't take

1351
01:33:00,171 --> 01:33:02,872
我們不能用這卷再拍更多照片了, 我覺得
any more pictures on this roll until earth comes, I don't think.

1352
01:33:02,874 --> 01:33:06,242
快用完了. 快用完了, 我們還剩最後一個彩色膠卷
This is about out, it's just about out until our last color roll,

1353
01:33:06,244 --> 01:33:08,744
我們一回到地球就得換成黑白膠捲了
so, uh, we'll switch to black and white as soon as we get to earth.

1354
01:33:08,746 --> 01:33:11,180
- 我們可能來得及. - 是
- We might make it in time. - Yeah.

1355
01:33:14,718 --> 01:33:17,219
在那, 升起來了. 什麼?
There it is, it's coming up. What?

1356
01:33:17,221 --> 01:33:18,754
地球. 看見沒有?
The earth. You see it?

1357
01:33:18,756 --> 01:33:20,389
是
Yeah.

1358
01:33:20,391 --> 01:33:24,660
真漂亮. 升起來一半
Beautiful. It's half-way up.
