1
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,078
謝謝各位
Thank you. Thank you.

2
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,714
也給你們自己點掌聲, 因為是你們付出的努力
But no, give yourselves a hand because it was your hard work

3
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,714
讓這個機構旗下的Yardsham Inlet邁進最成功的一年
that gave Yardsham Inlet the best year in the history of this agency.

4
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,268
在我們將功勞拱手相讓給我們的上司前
Before we let all that success go to our heads,

5
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,517
我們想讓大家來個聚會, 並再記起
we just thought we should get together
and reconnect with the fundamentals

6
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,954
是甚麼帶我們來到這一步
of what actually got us here.

7
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,633
為此, 我將會交給
For that, I'm gonna turn it over

8
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,633
我們產品的創辦人, 詩人及哲學家
to our resident poet philosopher of product.

9
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,319
反叛的指標
The rebel command of brand.

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,119
他是位讓麥迪遜大道的人聞風喪膽的領袖
He's the guru who terrifies Madison Avenue.

11
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,552
我的拍檔及知己
My partner, my better half,

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,720
Howard Inlet
Howard Inlet.

13
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,920
愛你
Love you.

15
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,994
噢, 你的"原因"是甚麼?
Oh. What is your "why"?

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,029
你今早為甚麼起床?
Why did you even get out of the bed this morning?

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,191
你為甚麼吃你所吃的?
Why did you eat what you ate?

18
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,510
你為甚麼穿你所穿的?
Why did you wear what you wore?

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,875
你為甚麼來這裡?
Why did you come here?

20
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,520
除了因為我會找人替代你的位置
Other than the fact that I would fire you and hire someone else

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,198
如果你不上班的話, 但...
if you didn't show up for work, but...

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,191
我要說的不是這個, 更重大的"原因"
Not that. The big "why."

23
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,797
我們會來這裡工作絕對不是為了賣東西而已
We're certainly not here to just sell shit.

24
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,157
我們來這裡
We are here

25
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,878
是去連繫
to connect.

26
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,510
生命的重點是人們
Life is about people.

27
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,478
而廣告的重點是
Advertising is about

28
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,518
點明我們的產品和服務
illuminating how our products and services

29
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,950
能夠提升人們生活的質素
will improve people's lives.

30
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,839
那
Now,

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,718
我們如何辦到?
how do we do that?

32
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,999
愛情
Love.

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,033
時間
Time.

34
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,073
死亡
Death.

35
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,036
這三個抽象的概念能夠連繫世上所有人
Now these three abstractions connect every single human being on Earth.

36
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,434
我們想要得到的事物
Everything that we covet,

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,272
我們害怕失去的事物
everything that we fear not having,

38
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,113
我們最終都會買的事物
everything that we ultimately end up buying

39
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,157
全都因為
is because at the end of the day

40
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,558
我們渴望愛情
we long for love,

41
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,071
我們希望有更多時間
we wish we had more time,

42
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,830
還有我們害怕死亡
and we fear death.

43
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,914
愛情
Love.

44
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,229
時間
Time.

45
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,113
死亡
Death.

46
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,077
我們就從那著手
Let's begin there.

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,158
[三年後]

47
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,158
這個砌了多久?
How long did this one take?

48
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,154
五天
Five days.

49
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,674
那其實很棒
That's pretty impressive.

50
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,160
- 可能他太早回來工作了   - 你開玩笑嗎?
- Maybe he came back too soon. - Are you kidding me?

51
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,396
這種日復一日的循例已經整整六個月了
It's been six months of this zombie routine.

52
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,760
我們不能再放縱他
We can't indulge this anymore.

53
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,236
尤其因為
Especially because

54
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,277
Danworth金融公司快要跟我們解約了
we're getting fired by Danworth Financial.

55
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,510
甚麼? 告訴我不是真的吧
What? You're kidding me.

56
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,816
- 不是吧, Whit   - 抱歉, 甚麼?
- No, Whit, come on!  - I'm sorry, what?

57
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,280
我昨天才跟他們會面
But I just talked to them yesterday.

58
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,256
我知道, 所有人都盡力隱瞞事實
I know. Everybody's been doing their best to cover,

59
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,748
但那整個戶口都是建基於Howard的人際關係
but that entire account is built on Howard's relationship.

60
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,056
我們一半的收入才是建基於Howard的人際關係
Half our billings are built on Howard's relationships.

61
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,256
這下可慘了, 簡直是大災難
This is a disaster. This is a disaster.

62
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,508
不, 還不是
No. Not yet.

63
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,194
宏盟集團向我們提出一股$17的提議 [美國一家公司]
We have an offer from Omnicom for $17 a share...

64
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,576
- 我們不能這樣做吧    - 但他們想要
- Oh, come on!    -...but they want an answer

65
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,953
- 在新年前得到答覆   - 殊
- by New Year's.   - Shh.

66
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,875
坦白說, 我們甚至不值一股$14
Let's be honest, we're not worth $14 a share

67
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,320
如果我的拍檔打算繼續
if my partner takes a sabbatical

68
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,197
在他幻想的瘋狂小鎮中以骨牌之王自冠
as the local domino champion of Crazy Town.

69
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,480
Whit, 那說得有點過份了
That's a little harsh, Whit.

70
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,517
抱歉, 但那是現實
I'm sorry, but it's true.

71
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,035
Simon, 我正式賦予你接受宏盟集團的提議的權力
Simon, I am empowering you. Go make the deal with Omnicom.

72
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,989
我也想, 但Howard手持有表決權股份
I wish I could, but Howard controls the voting shares.

73
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,456
我會跟Howard說, 好了嗎?
I'll deal with the Howard part, okay?

74
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,674
先準備文件草稿, Simon
Just push the papers, Simon.

75
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,877
我依然不明白為何Howard手持60%有表決權股份
I still don't understand why Howard got 60% of the voting shares

76
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,149
而你只擁有40%
and you only got 40.

77
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,595
因為我當時需要金錢去辦妥我的離婚手續
Because I needed cash to settle my divorce

78
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,718
而Howard讓我賣給他一些股份, 那幫了我很大的忙
and Howard did me a huge favor and let me sell him some.

79
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,072
即是說, 如果你從沒跟那剛入行的創作者有婚外情
So, if you never had an affair with some junior creative,

80
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,536
我們就不會落得如此下場?
we wouldn't be in this situation?

81
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,391
這是不準確又不公平的
Inaccurate and unfair

82
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,790
如果硬要讓我一力承擔
to put it squarely on my shoulders.

83
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,394
我只是在說事實
Well, I'm just pointing out the facts.

84
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,237
天啊, 有人會不喜歡這香氣嗎?
Oh, my God. Don't you just love that smell?

85
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,793
等下
Wait. Stop.

86
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,359
閉下眼
Close your eyes.

87
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,993
用力吸
Breathe it in.

88
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,150
有沒有讓你回想起童年?
Doesn't that remind you of your childhood?

89
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,914
Claire, 來這邊
Claire, come here.

90
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,512
坐下吧, 我有點事要告訴你
Come on, I got to tell you something.

91
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,720
甚麼?
What?

92
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,279
我最近一直試著改變我們現在的處境
I have been doing something about our situation

93
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,112
我覺得你有必要知道
that you need to know about.

94
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
你都做了甚麼?
What did you do?

95
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,759
我聘請了一個人
I hired someone.

96
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,995
你聘請了一個人?
You hired someone?

97
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,238
對, 聽著, 以前Eloise抓到我出軌
Yes. Look, when Eloise caught me cheating,

98
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,949
是因為她聘用了一位叫Sally Price的私家偵探
she used a private investigator named Sally Price.

99
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,176
她看上去像一個摩門教的老婆婆般不起眼
She's this woman who looks like a Mormon grandmother,

100
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,953
這給了她最好的隱藏身份
and it makes her very good at the whole stealth thing.

101
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,356
你聘請了那個讓你離婚的女人?
You hired the woman who caused your divorce?

102
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,552
不, 是我導致離婚的
No. I caused my divorce.

103
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,154
Sally Price只是將我的婚外情記錄在案而已
Sally Price just documented it.

104
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,274
你還真不計前嫌
Wow. That was actually enlightened.

105
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,990
我們早已討論過吧, 我是個有深度的人
I have hidden depth. We've discussed this.

106
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,634
所以
So,

107
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,438
你為何聘用那個摩門教老婆婆?
why did you hire the Mormon grandmother?

108
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,433
因為我們需要記錄Howard現在的情況
Because we need to document what's going on with Howard.

109
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,394
我們需要顯示他精神不夠健全去作出決定
We need to show that he's not mentally fit to vote his shares.

110
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,154
不, 我們不是真的要...
No. We're not really in that place where we're...

111
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,437
我們真的要變成這樣的損友嗎?
We're actually gonna be the people who would do that to a friend?

112
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,749
不是因為他一定不會賣他的股份
It's not that he won't sell,

113
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,317
而是因為他甚至不去談論這個問題
it's that he won't even have a conversation about selling.

114
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,119
我試過接觸他, 跟他說話
I try to talk to him, I try to reach him,

115
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,760
而那就好像我跟他處在不同的次元一樣
and it's like I'm not even in the same physical space with him.

116
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,880
他心不在焉
He's not there.

117
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,996
他的孩子去世了
His kid died.

118
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,515
那已經是兩年前的事了, Claire
That was two years ago, Claire.

119
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,994
我們要怎樣...
What are we gonna...

120
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,071
現在火燒眉毛
This is our lives at stake.

121
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,080
我們不再是小孩了, 你當著我面跟我說
We're not kids anymore. You look me in the face

122
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,496
你願意讓過去十年你所付出過的
and tell me that you're willing to have everything you've worked for

123
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,636
付諸東流, 我就不去做
for the last 10 years just evaporate.

124
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,519
這個私家偵探出色嗎?
Is this PI good?

125
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,477
她抓到我出軌了
She caught me cheating.

126
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,120
Oscar也能做到
Oscar could have caught you cheating.

127
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,679
誰是Oscar?
Who the hell's Oscar?

128
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,840
我兒子
My son.

129
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,996
噢, 那個Oscar?
Oh. That Oscar?

130
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,160
這個私家偵探不會找到任何
This private investigator isn't gonna find anything

131
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,031
違背道德的事
that'll pass for moral turpitude.

132
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,871
至少不會在Howard身上找到
Not on Howard,

133
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,759
但如果她能引起他的法律資格的質疑
but if she can raise concern regarding legal capacity,

134
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,069
那我們就成事了
then we'll be in business.

135
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,674
我真的覺得我們別無選擇
I do really think that we are out of other options.

136
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,673
他六個月來一直對心理輔導員愛理不理
You know, he terrorized the grief counselor for six months.

137
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,549
他完全不理我們遠道從秘魯取回來的死藤水薩滿草藥
He totally blew off the Ayahuasca shaman we flew in all the way from Peru.

138
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,393
而我們完全不能開解他
And our...Our intervention was a disaster.

139
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,834
我只是...
I just...

140
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,757
你的提議聽起來不對
Look, uh, this doesn't feel right.

141
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,799
我明白
I know.

142
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,633
但從一個六歲的孩子患上絕症開始
But when something starts with a six-year-old dying,

143
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,472
沒甚麼聽起來是對的
nothing is gonna feel right.

144
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
他寫了幾封信
He writes letters.

145
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,237
信? 甚麼信?
Letters? What kind of letters?

146
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,960
這可能是我生涯遇過最奇怪的一件事
This might be the strangest thing I have ever come across.

147
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,951
- 你有拿到那些信嗎?   - 有
- You got the letters?   - Oh, yeah.

148
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,917
我們可以問下來歷嗎?
Can we ask you how?

149
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,509
花了我$800
Cost me $800

150
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,749
來造這把鑰匙
to get this cut.

151
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,920
順道說下
And just so you know,

152
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,277
從郵箱裡直接偷取信件是犯法的
it's a federal offense to steal mail directly from a mailbox.

153
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,670
- 你可以收起...   - 對
- You could...   - Yeah.

154
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,115
- 共有三封信   - 寫給誰的?
- So, three letters.   - Who are they to?

155
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,600
- 噢, 不是"誰"   - 甚麼意思?
- Oh, not who.   - What do you mean?

156
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,320
Howard不寫信給人
Howard doesn't write letters to people.

157
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,799
他寫信給事
He writes to things.

158
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,831
- 甚麼事?   - 時間
- What kind of things?   - Time.

159
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,032
愛情
Love.

160
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,595
死亡
Death.

161
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,592
那三個抽像的概念
The three abstractions.

162
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,915
致時間
"Time,

163
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,355
人們說你是一切傷害的良藥
"they say you heal all wounds,

164
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,431
但他們不會說起你如何
"but they don't talk about how you destroy

165
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,840
將一切美好化為腐朽
"all that's good in the world.

166
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,555
如何將美麗的事物化作塵埃
"How you turn beauty into ash.

167
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,192
聽著, 你對我來說只不過是木化石
"Well, you're nothing more than petrified wood to me.

168
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,591
你是塊不會分解的壞死組織
"You're a dead tissue that won't decompose.

169
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
你甚麼也不是
"You're nothing."

170
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,070
那不代表甚麼, 我們不能利用這個吧?
That doesn't prove anything. We can't use that, right?

171
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,271
對, 孩子們都寫信給聖誕老人
No. I mean, kids write letters to Santa Claus,

172
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,640
那不代表他們瘋了
it doesn't mean they're crazy.

173
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,075
不, 這很治療
No. This is therapeutic.

174
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,514
太悲傷了
It's so sad.

175
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,591
對, 還有甚麼嗎?
Yeah. Anything else?

176
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,232
他平常下班後, 會到布魯克林的一個寵物公園
Usually after work, he goes to a small dog park in Brooklyn,

177
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,436
即使他沒有養狗
even though he doesn't own a dog.

178
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,113
就呆坐在那裡
Just sits there for hours.

179
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,760
他會寫信給狗嗎?
Does he write letters to the dogs?

180
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,680
你開玩笑嗎?
Are you serious?

181
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,576
我說, 那就是我們想要的全壘打, 對吧?
Well, that would be like the home run, right?

182
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,079
那是我們想要的有力證據
I mean, that's what we need.

183
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,111
- 他會嗎?   - 我沒有看到
- Does he?   - Not that I saw.

184
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,352
- 好吧, 還有甚麼嗎?   - 沒有了, 真的
- Okay. What else?   - That's it, really.

185
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,233
每天回到自己的寓所, 非必要也不出門
Goes home to his apartment. Rarely leaves before morning.

186
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,675
沒有網絡, 寬頻, 電話, 甚麼也沒有
No Wi-Fi, cable, phone. Nothing.

187
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,959
你是塊不會分解的壞死組織
"You're a dead tissue that won't decompose."

188
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,834
Howard?
Howard?

189
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,318
嗨, 是Claire
Hey, it's Claire.

190
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,990
我經過路口的一間餐廳給你買了晚餐
I swung by that place down the street and got you some dinner.

191
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,834
有你喜歡的蝦
It's that shrimp thing you like.

192
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,837
好吧, 我把它放在這, 以防你還沒吃晚餐
Okay, I'm gonna leave it right here, in case you haven't eaten.

193
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,680
嘿, 別再留下食物在那裡
Hey, don't keep leaving the food there.

194
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,760
他不會吃的
He doesn't eat it.

195
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,672
噢, 抱歉
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

196
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,478
還有他又遲了交房租
And he's late on his rent again.

197
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,256
他不應門, 我也沒有手提電話號碼給他
He doesn't answer his door, and I don't have a working number for him.

198
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,555
他沒有電話了
Yeah, he doesn't have a phone anymore.

199
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,513
他欠多少錢了? 我寫支票給你
Um, how much does he owe? I'll write you a check.

200
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,557
隨便你
If that's what you want to do.

201
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,679
還有如果你不帶走那晚餐
And, uh, if you're not doing anything with that shrimp...

202
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,039
我想說上週的球花甘藍很美味
Broccoli rabe last week was delicious.

203
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,557
他來了
Here he is.

204
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,588
嘿, 你的行李呢?
Hey, where's your stuff?

205
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,075
我本想發訊息給你, 但媽媽要我致電給你
I wanted to text you, but Mom said I had to call.

206
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,434
說甚麼?
Text me about what?

207
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,478
然後Barry就我必須親口跟你說
But then Barry said I had to tell you in person.

208
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,751
所以我們現在都要聽Barry的提議嗎?
Are we taking life advice from Barry now?

209
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,576
你...你想告訴我甚麼?
What are... What are you trying to tell me?

210
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,999
我不會過來跟你住
I'm not coming to stay with you.

211
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,776
我要跟Barry和媽媽一起去巴哈馬
I'm going with Barry and Mom to the Bahamas.

212
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,314
不, 等下
No, no. Wait, wait, wait.

213
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,869
午安
Hi.

214
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,514
你好嗎?
How you doing?

215
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,400
我可以跟我的女兒
Can I get, like, five minutes, maybe a couple feet

216
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,636
獨自相處一會嗎?
just to have this conversation with my daughter?

217
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,789
謝謝
Thanks.

218
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,188
寶貝, 我...
Honey, I got...

219
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,536
我把所有事都計劃好了
I got all kinds of stuff planned.

220
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,736
我買了聖誕樹
I got a Christmas tree for us.

221
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,795
那你真慘
Then sucks for you.

222
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,096
我買了漢密爾頓音樂劇的票
I got us tickets to Hamilton.

223
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,519
那真糟糕
Then sucks for Hamilton.

224
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,033
Allison, 那音樂劇一票難求
That's a tough ticket, Allison.

225
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,389
我已經看過了
I've already seen it.

226
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,550
你看過? 跟你母親和Barry?
You did? You saw that with Mom and Barry?

227
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,153
和Odell Beckham Jr [美式足球外接手]
And Odell Beckham Jr.

228
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,839
還有Odell Beckham?
And Odell Beckham?

229
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,559
對
Yeah.

230
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,119
他是Barry的朋友之一
He's one of Barry's friends.

231
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,309
為甚麼?
Why?

232
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,296
為甚麼你不想跟我一起過節日?
Why don't you want to spend the holiday with me?

233
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,639
我想你了
I miss you.

234
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,473
因為我恨你
Because I hate you.

235
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,398
因為是個慈善家
Because you're a philanthropist.

236
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,750
因為你傷透了媽媽的心
Because you broke Mom's heart.

237
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,148
- 隨性所欲的人   - 甚麼?
- Philanderer.   - What?

238
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,016
你想說的是隨性所欲的人, 不是慈悲家, 
The word you're looking for is philanderer, not philanthropist.

239
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,600
兩者有點不同
They have a slightly different meaning.

240
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,398
你當然知道分別
Well, you would know.

242
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,189
我答應他們親口告訴你, 現在我做到了
Look, I agreed to tell you in person, and now I have.

243
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,755
嘿
Hey,

244
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,632
祝你聖誕快樂
have a good Christmas.

245
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,634
等下
Hold it.

246
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,554
嗨
Hey.

247
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,631
趁你在, 來個快問快答嗎?
So, rapid fire round while I got you?

248
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,392
騎士隊作客
Cavs are in town.

249
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,232
在麥迪遜廣場花園上演聖誕大戰
Christmas showdown at the Garden.

250
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,718
我從沒給過你門票
I never give your seat away.

251
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,990
現在只剩我一個去, 但我們也可以一起去
I just go solo, but we could go.

252
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,640
到時候不理會大家也行
Don't even have to talk. Don't even have to look at each other.

253
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,016
可以像我們現在一樣, 然後專心看比賽
We can do just what we're doing right now and just watch the game.

254
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,439
就像舊時候一樣
Be like old times.

255
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,548
好了, 第二題
Right, number two.

256
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,016
我們快要失去Danworth這個客戶
We're gonna lose the Danworth account

257
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,800
因為那一直都是你打理的
because that's always been your relationship.

258
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,149
你也能想像得到, 他們不再感受到你的用心
And they're not feeling the love, as you might imagine.

259
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
所以那就是無可避免的
So that's gonna happen.

260
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,596
隨便吧
Whatever though,

261
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,115
因為我們有來自宏盟集團的提議, 而且非常誘人
because we've got an offer from Omnicom, and it's real.

262
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,878
一股$17
17 bucks a share.

263
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,318
請認真考慮, 因為...
Please consider it, because...

264
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,959
對, 我也知道
Yeah, yeah.

265
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,436
因為他們讓我們繼續現有的模式, 而且沒人會被辭退
Because they leave total creative control
and they let everybody keep their jobs,

266
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,160
我知道你在意你的員工, 因為你愛他們
which I know you care about, because you love these people.

267
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,840
非常愉快的談心
Good talk.

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,840
[找尋你的精子捐贈者]

北京的人來了
The Beijing boys are here.

269
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,157
天啊, 沒有人會想要喝中國咖啡
Oh, God. No one wants Chinese coffee.

270
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,355
我們總要為他們賣廣告
Well, we're selling it.

271
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,193
滿州的瑪琪雅朵咖啡, 嗯
The Manchurian macchiato. Mmm.

272
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,994
我們在為甚麼選角?
What are we casting?

273
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,880
- 遊輪   - 看, 那才值得
- Cruise line.    - Now, see, that's good copy.

274
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,600
放下一切, 尋找意義
"Shed your skin, find your life."

275
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,193
抱歉, 應該是
Sorry, it's

276
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,920
當你放下一切才能找到生命意義
"Life is found when you shed your skin."

277
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,594
- 有所謂嗎?   - 有, 因為是我寫的
- Does it really matter?  - Yes, because I wrote it.

278
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,593
原來如此, 但我的較好
Oh, well, my way's better.

279
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,159
- 你真認為嗎? 哪裡較好?   - 對
- Really? How?   - Yeah.

280
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,833
重溫一下, 你的是甚麼?
Well... Wait, what is your way?

281
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,036
當你放下一切才能找到生命意義
"Life is found when you shed your skin."

282
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,158
說中你腦裡想的
Which, you know, kind of hits you here.

283
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,435
放下一切, 尋找意義
"Shed your skin, find your life."

284
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,874
說到心窩裡
Hits you here.

285
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,429
真的耶
That does hit me here.

286
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,198
對吧?
Right?

287
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
你可以隨便拿去用
You can have it for free.

288
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,317
等下
Just, wait. Wait.

289
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,674
等下
Wait.

290
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,189
- 嗨, Frankel   - 甚麼事?
- Hey, Frankel.   - Yeah?

291
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,078
放下一切, 尋找意義
"Shed your skin, find your life."

292
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,310
放下一切, 尋找意義, 知道了嗎?
"Shed your skin, find your life."
Everybody, okay?

293
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,480
知道
Got it.

294
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,953
她美化了它
She made it better.

295
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,035
嘿!
Hey!

296
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,308
別走
No, no, no.

297
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,555
嘿!
Hey, hey!

298
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,151
而你用這樣的語氣跟我說話
"And you talk to me in such tones

299
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,959
說得好像不是我把你帶到這個世上
"as if it wasn't the breath in my lungs that gave you life."

300
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,633
- 你遲到了   - 抱歉
- You're late.   - Sorry.

301
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,756
說得好像不是因為我的靈光一觸
"As if it wasn't a spark in my mind

302
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,592
才給予生命意義
"that gave that life meaning."

303
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,910
噢, 你的舌頭在動, 你的嘴在吐字
"Oh, you move your tongue, you mouth syllables,

304
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,752
你的情感在翻騰
"you echo sentiment.

305
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,148
但你沒有活過
"But you do not breathe."

306
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,389
你說火花?
"You speak of spark?

307
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,988
那簡直是奢求
"That is richness.

308
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,350
因為你否認我們兩個之間的火花
"For you deny the spark between us all.

309
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,399
那火花比起你那冷酷無情的火燄, 簡直是太陽般溫暖
"A spark that is more a sun than the cold fire you claim.

310
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,799
而你竟形容我為年輕的衝動
"And you have called me a temporary madness.

311
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,188
一個邪惡的靈魂
"A vicious soul.

312
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,793
那
"Well,

313
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,919
撫心自問你想不想再見我一面
"then ask if you will see me just one more time."

314
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,113
你好
Hello?

315
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,795
你好
Hi.

316
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,076
抱歉, 我擅自走進這裡
So sorry. I literally just wandered in,

317
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,959
我剛好看到最尾的部分
and I caught the tail end of that, and...

318
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,960
我可以表達我的讚賞嗎?
Can I just say that was beautiful?

319
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,155
那是甚麼話劇?
What is... What is it?

320
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,216
只是些構思而已
It's just something we're trying to put together.

321
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,117
我...我很喜歡話劇, 哪類型都喜歡
I just... I love theater. I see everything.

322
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,776
正式表演是甚麼時候? 我會來的
So when's opening night? I'll be there.

323
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,234
直到我們籌得足夠的錢前都不會有正式表演
There is no opening night until we get this money together.

324
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,436
- 你富有嗎?   - 我離婚了
- You rich?   - Divorced.

325
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,597
你從剛才試鏡就跟著我
You followed me from the casting session.

326
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,671
- 對, 是的   - 是吧
- Absolutely, I did. Yes.   - Yeah.

327
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,149
我幾乎看不到你, 但你的紅帽子幫了忙
I almost lost you, but the red hat helped.

328
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,630
我要說件有點突然的事
Hey, um, I'm gonna say something a little impulsive here,

329
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,840
聽起來或者有點瘋狂
maybe a little crazy,

330
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,560
我有件想要做的事
but, you know, I have something about to happen for me.

331
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,072
我正在跟別人商討當中, 但如果能成事
I'm in the middle of a deal that if it all comes together,

332
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,679
我就能資助你們
I'd be in a position to help.

333
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,671
那不是雙贏的局面嗎?
Well, now wouldn't that be lovely?

334
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,317
是, 是件很好的事
It would. Be great.

335
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,158
而你, 你剛才幫助了我
And you, you know, you fixed it.

336
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,596
所以, 如果你想要剛才試鏡的工作的話, 我們可以讓你來
So, we should get you back into casting if you want the gig.

337
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,240
抱歉, 我甚至還沒請教你的名字
Sorry, I don't even... I don't know your name.

338
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,910
- 我叫Amy   - Amy
- Amy.   - Amy.

339
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,435
好吧
Okay. Well,

340
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,751
我會再來的, Amy
I'll be back, Amy. I'll be back.

341
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,229
我先走...
Mmm. And I'll be...

342
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,756
抱歉
Hmm. Sorry.

343
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,274
我太興奮了
I was on the stage!

344
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,919
我會再來的
I'll be back.

345
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,234
你很有演技
You're good.

346
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,119
真有你的
Well done, you.

350
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,556
等下, 現在都有"犯罪現場:克里夫蘭"了嗎?
Wait, they have a CSI: Cleveland now?

351
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,616
是全新一輯
It's a new show.

355
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,918
那些狼人
The werewolves,

356
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,911
他們在外面聚集
they're meeting out front

357
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,991
每晚都是
all hours of the night.

358
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,593
對, 我也留意到
I heard them. Yeah.

359
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,752
我想他們...
I think they're...

360
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,559
我想他們正在投票選出組織的頭目
I think they're voting on a new head of the syndicate.

361
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,869
但
But

362
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,439
我有個浣熊朋友, 他是特種部隊的一員
I got a raccoon friend. He's on the task force.

363
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,636
他在外面幫我放了個監聽器在垃圾桶上
He put a bug out there for me by the trash cans.

364
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,597
我們將會錄下他們所說的一切
We're gonna tape everything they say

365
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,110
並以詐騙、操縱和賄賂組織法控告他們
and we'll bust them on a RICO statute.

366
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,111
我不知道那是甚麼
I don't know anything about that.

367
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,191
嘿, 我是你的兒子
Hey, I'm your son.

368
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,837
這我知道
I know that!

369
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,118
很好
Good.

370
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,279
我離開一下
I'll be right back.

371
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,472
我有個大膽的想法
Okay, I have kind of a wild idea.

372
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,776
你們聽了很可能會取笑我
And I know you're gonna laugh at me,

373
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,760
但記住我們沒有其他辦法, 所以聽我說完
but remember that we're desperate and hear me out.

374
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,759
我的母親自從中風後精神狀態就不佳, 對吧?
So, my mom hasn't been totally in her right mind since her stroke, right?

375
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,639
而我經常試著提醒她身邊發生甚麼事
And I'm always trying to remind her what's actually going on

376
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,229
還有改正她的胡言亂語
and correct the, sort of, daffy things that she says.

377
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,296
而這樣做令她感到不快樂, 我也不知所措
And it upsets her, and it really stresses me out.

378
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,056
有段時間事情變得很麻煩
And it was pretty much just awful for a while.

379
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,640
然後, 有人解開了我的心結
And then, someone said something very, very wise to me.

380
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,749
他們說: 或者你不該強逼她聽你的那套
They said, "Maybe you should stop trying to force your reality on her

381
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,992
而你試著跟她的思路走
"and just... Just go into her reality."

382
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,991
我以為你沒錢去支付治療費了
I thought you couldn't afford therapy anymore.

383
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,991
- 我是沒有, 那是我的優步司機說的  - 噢
- I can't. It was my Uber driver.   - Oh.

384
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,511
他完全正確
And he was totally right. Totally right!

385
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,672
當我開始照他說的做, 所有事都輕鬆多了
As soon as I started doing this, 
everything got easier, you know?

386
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,831
我跟她的生活就變得很即興
Our life is like this improvisational game.

387
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,430
她說些有的沒的, 而我就以她的方式回答她
She just... She says wackadoodle stuff, and I respond to it.

388
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,036
現在她過得很快樂, 而我也頗喜歡這互動
And, uh, she's totally happy and I kind of have fun.

389
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,576
那讓我想到一個人
And that made me think of something else.

390
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,352
好了
Okay.

391
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,189
以前我在FBW時 [應為診所之類]
When I was at FBW,

392
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,376
我有個買興奮藥的戶口
I had this account for a psychostimulant drug, right?

393
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,360
他們辦了個甚麼籌款活動
And they went with some bullshit generic campaign,

394
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,216
我買了這套"西班牙裔美國人市場"
but I kept the Hispanic market.

395
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,355
看這個
Here, watch this. Okay.

396
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,755
那老師非常苦惱
So, the teacher is really stressing. He's saying, uh,

397
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,956
你們都在自己說話, 不聽我講課
"Well, you talk all the time! You never listen!"

398
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,917
然後怪物進來
And then here comes the monster.

399
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,376
它說: 不用這樣的
"It doesn't have to be this way."

400
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,391
老師說: 你是誰?
Teacher, "Who are you?"

401
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,993
怪物說: 我就是你的憤怒啊
Monster, "I'm your anger, man."

402
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
老師回答
And the teacher says...

403
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,640
我不能再忍受你, 你支配了我的生命
"I can't stand you, man. You dominate my life."

404
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,598
然後它回答: 有個解決方法, 朋友
And anger says, "There's a solution, my friend.

405
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,557
Docotrin, 助你解決憤怒問題
"Docotrin, say goodbye to your anger."

406
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,593
你明白我想說的話?
Do you see where I'm going with this?

407
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,190
- 不太懂   - 好了, 聽著
- Not really.   - Okay, okay. Look, look.

408
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,555
我們不能讓Howard聽我們的那套
We can't get Howard to deal with this
reality that we need him to deal with.

409
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,433
他在寫信給抽像的概念, 完全不合邏輯
And he's writing letters to abstractions which makes no sense.

410
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,551
但他依然繼續做
But... But he's doing it.

411
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,950
那麼, 如果我們跟他的思路
So, what if we just go into his reality

412
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,759
讓那些抽像的概念回應他?
and we get those abstractions to answer him?

413
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,159
抱歉, 我不明白
I'm sorry, I... I don't follow.

414
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,950
如果讓愛情, 時間, 死亡實體化
What if Love, Time and Death show up in person

415
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,429
回應Howard寫給他們的信怎樣?
and answer the letters that Howard's been writing to them?

416
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,434
在哪找愛情, 時間, 死亡?
How are Time, Love and Death gonna show up?

417
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,591
演員
Actors.

418
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,150
我們聘請演員扮演愛情, 時間, 死亡
We hire actors to be Love, Death and Time.

419
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,471
他們找到Howard並跟他對質
They find Howard and they confront him.

420
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,640
所以你想讓我們欺騙你的上司?
So, you want us to gaslight your boss?

421
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,191
- 抱歉, 甚麼?   - 煤氣燈下
- Huh? I'm sorry?   - Gas Light.

422
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,120
知道嗎? 是齣話劇, 然後拍成電影
You know? It was a play, then it was a movie.

423
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,998
那套煤氣燈下? 天啊
Gas Light? Oh, my God.

424
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,948
沒有人會再看長過八秒鐘的事了嗎?
Does nobody ever watch anything longer than eight seconds anymore?

425
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,635
她的意思是, 你想我們讓他以為自己瘋了?
What she's saying is you want us to make him think he's crazy?

426
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,395
不, 目的不是這個
No, no, no. It's not about making Howard think he's crazy.

427
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,473
Howard精神狀態不佳, 我們幾個都知道
Howard's not in a good mental state, and we know that.

428
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,873
目的是讓他人也知道
It's about underlining that fact so that other people can see it, too.

429
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,358
所以你想讓我們跟他接觸時演戲
Okay. So you want us to perform in this intervention,

430
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,592
而你們事後會資助我們的話劇?
and for that you're gonna finance our play?

431
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,869
- 對   - 正是
- That's it.   - Exactly.

432
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,031
對, 我們會資助這個甚麼...
Yeah, we'll finance whatever...

433
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,896
這看起來像是貨倉, 但...
I mean, this looks like a storage facility, but...

434
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,354
好吧, 其他演員, 我們怎樣?
Okay. Well, actors. What do we think?

435
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,988
- 不不不   - 噢, 不是
- No. No, no, no.   - Oh, no.

436
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
聽著
Listen, listen!

437
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,673
我們每人要求$15,000
We take $15,000 each.

438
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,593
- 好嗎? $15,000   - 你瘋了嗎?
- Okay? $15,000.  - Are you completely out of your mind?

439
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,512
好吧, 我們會幫你們
Okay, we'll do it.

440
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,033
以每人$20,000的報酬
$20,000, each.

441
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,510
不! 我剛...你們才剛說15,000, 我聽到的
Uh-uh! I just...You guys just said 15. I heard you say 15.

442
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,996
- 我喜歡20,000   - 我也是
- Mmm... I like 20.   - I like 20 as well.

443
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,240
20,000真的太...有點過份了
Well, 20's just... I don't know, it's a little steep.

444
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,656
我打算給2,000的, 這些人很可能住在布魯克林
I was thinking two. These guys probably live in Brooklyn.

445
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,336
- 他們月租$600   - 夠了, 停下吧
- They pay 600 bucks a month. - Stop talking. Just stop.

446
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,536
你做得不錯
You did a good job pulling them down.

447
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,240
這很可怕, 這事完全不對
This is horrible. This is completely wrong.

448
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,114
不, Amy, 這就是我們的工作, 是演戲
No, Amy. This is the work. This is acting.

449
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,520
你沒聽到他們說這個人的孩子過世了嗎?
Did you not hear them say that this man's lost his child?

450
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,150
有, 那就是為何他選擇向宇宙中尋找答案
Yes. And that's why he's reaching out to the cosmos for answers.

451
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,232
我們有幸扮演他想找的
Well, we get to be that cosmos.

452
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,518
所以你想我們運用這個男人的痛處, 然後怎樣?
So you want us to manipulate this guy's pain so that, what?

453
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,551
你們兌現? 賺很多錢?
What, you cash out?
You make a lot of money?

454
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,200
- 不!   - 當然不是!
- No!   - No, no, no, no!

455
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,696
你這樣說聽起來不對
That doesn't sound good when you put it that way.

456
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,029
- 這比看上去複雜得多   - 是嗎?
- It's a lot more complicated than that.  - Is it?

457
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,235
我們都愛這個人
We love this man.

458
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,636
他不只是我們上司, 他是朋友
And he's not just a boss, he's a friend.

459
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,472
Howard是個有才華, 創意和魅力的男人
Howard is a brilliant, creative, charismatic guy

460
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
他曾經是那樣無所畏懼
who used to be fearless.

461
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,110
他曾經熱愛他的生命, 而現在, 他恨透了生命
He used to love life, and right now, he hates it.

462
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,068
你們真的認為那樣做能幫助他?
And you really think that this is gonna help him?

463
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,713
他失去了他的孩子
He lost his child.

464
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,908
而現在他不介意失去所有
And now he doesn't care if he loses everything else.

465
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,429
我們不能讓這發生
We just can't let that happen.

466
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,272
我們要帶他回來現實
We have to bring him back.

467
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,228
$20,000物有所值
$20,000's worth it.

468
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,656
- 我會付的   - Claire!
- I'll pay for it.   - Claire!

469
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,910
我會自己交出錢來, 我不在意
I'll pay for it. I'll pay for it myself. I don't care.

470
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,238
那規則呢?
So, what are the rules?

471
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,233
首先我們需要簽合同
Well, first, we'd have to sign a confidentiality agreement.

472
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,256
確保你們不說出去, 因為...
And make sure that you don't talk about it, 'cause...

473
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,576
我不是指法律條款
No, I don't mean the legal rules.

474
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,397
我指這齣戲
I mean, the rules of the theatrical device.

475
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,513
例如, 其他人也能看到我們嗎? 還是只有Howard?
I mean, do other people see us, or only Howard?

476
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,760
- 對, 其他人也能看到他們嗎, Whit?   -Whit?
- Yeah, do other people see them, Whit?  - Whit?

477
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,673
我猜...只有Howard吧
I guess... I guess only Howard.

478
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,831
那就是我們想要的效果吧?
That's the effect we're looking for, right?

479
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,479
- 猜?   - 你猜? 我...
- Guess?   - You guess? I mean...

480
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,280
抱歉, 你到底有沒有想清楚?
I'm sorry, have you thought this through?

481
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,793
- 當然有   - 沒有
- Sure. Sure.   - No.

482
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,176
- 一定程度吧   - 不, 我們沒有
- I mean, to a degree.   - No, we haven't.

483
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,555
沒有, Whit, 停下, 我們沒有想清楚
No, we haven't, Whit. Shut up! Like... We haven't.

484
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,632
假設他們想要到酒吧裡喝一杯呢?
For instance, what if they go into a bar and they want to order a drink?

485
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,869
他們如何能...
How can they do that if...

486
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,936
你近來有看見Howard進酒吧嗎?
Do you see Howard walking into a lot of bars these days?

487
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,188
隨便吧, 那不重要
Whatever. Doesn't matter.

488
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,016
- 那Howard突然想去俱樂部呢?   - 他們是演員
- I mean, what if Howard goes clubbing?  - They're actors.

489
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,838
- 他們需要預備這種情況    - 夠了夠了
- They need to know hypothetically.
- Okay. Okay. Enough. Enough.

490
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,436
我們有選擇被誰看見, 何時看見的能力
We have the power to be seen by whomever we want, whenever we want.

491
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,312
- 那怎樣?    - 不錯, 我喜歡
- How's that?   - I like that, I like that.

492
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,136
- 我說過他們是好演員  - 我喜歡
- I told you they were good.   - I like that, yeah.

493
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,440
我們該留給他們想
We should just leave it to them.

494
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,549
繼續
Let's move on.

495
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
下一步呢?
What's next?

496
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,792
Howard寫了三封信, 分別給愛情, 時間和死亡
Howard wrote three letters to Love, Death and Time.

497
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,997
所以我想唯一的問題是, 誰扮演哪個?
So, I guess the only question is who plays who?

498
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,071
選角, 非常重要
Casting. Very important.

499
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,834
愛情
Love.

500
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,599
死亡
Death.

501
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,320
時間
Time.

502
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,629
很好, 我們何時收到報酬?
Great. When do we get paid?

503
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,150
致死亡, 你經過很多神話
"Dear Death, you travel with so much mythology,

504
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,352
給予很多傷痛, 引起很多恐懼
"cause so much pain, inspire such fear.

505
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,591
但你對我來說紙老虎
"But you're a paper tiger to me.

506
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,877
你只是個可悲又沒作為的中層管理人員
"You're just pathetic and powerless middle management.

507
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,640
你甚至沒有權力去做一個簡單的交易
"You don't even have the authority to make a simple trade."

508
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,837
你也看到, 這不是位支持者寫的信
As you can see, it's not exactly a fan letter.

509
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,200
對, 死亡沒有很多支持者
Yeah, well, Death doesn't have any fans.

510
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,676
我不明白你們為何這樣做, 因為這也算是解放
I don't understand why, because it's a liberation.

511
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,716
你還好嗎?
Hey, you okay?

513
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,190
他上班, 然後去寵物公園
He goes to work, and the dog park.

514
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,874
就這兩個地方
And that's it.

515
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,553
好吧, 這就是我會做的
Okay. So, here's how I'm gonna do it.

516
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,199
我會很憤怒的走上他面前
I'm gonna come to him angry.

517
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,550
非常憤怒的, 像我們有問題要解決
Like, pissed off. Like, we got a problem.

518
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,029
不, 別這樣做
No, no, no. Don't do that.

519
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,232
他說我是木和壞死組織, 他在呼喚我
He's calling me wood and dead tissue. He's calling me out.

520
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
這怎算呼喚你?
How's he calling you out?

521
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,754
是時間
Time.

522
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,832
[找尋一個更安全的捐贈者]
他在呼喚時間, 而我就是時間
He's calling out Time, and I'm Time.

523
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,555
我不想你去跟Howard對抗
Look, I don't want you antagonizing Howard.

524
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,073
你明白嗎?
Do you get that?

525
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,232
但信裡只寫了"再見"
But the letter only consists of one word, "Goodbye."

526
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,920
看
Look.

527
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,071
致愛情, 再見
"Dear Love, goodbye."

528
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,914
我到底要跟他說甚麼?
What am I even supposed to say to him?

529
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,276
那...
Um, it's...

530
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,016
這是封道別愛情的信, 對吧?
It's a letter to Love saying goodbye, right?

531
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,712
- 對   - 那假如你走上前
- Yeah.    - So, what if you approach him,

532
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,393
然後說你拒絕接受?
and you refuse to accept that?

533
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,835
你說他不能那麼容易就擺脫你
You say he can't get rid of you that easily.

534
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,234
告訴他
Tell him that

535
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,234
我們沒有選擇愛誰和被誰受的權利
we don't get to choose who we love and who loves us back.

536
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,956
告訴他你在他之中
Tell him that you're within him,

537
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,029
你在萬物之中, 無論他喜歡與否
you're within everything, whether he likes it or not.

538
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,271
如果他接受了
And if he accepts that,

539
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,153
那可能... 我不知道
then maybe... I don't know.

540
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,915
他可能找回他的生存意義
Maybe he gets to find his life again.

541
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,673
他們會悲傷
They grieve.

542
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,078
狗隻們
Dogs.

543
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,471
他們會悲傷, 而且了解死亡
They grieve, and they fully understand death.

544
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,755
你說我是紙老虎
You called me a paper tiger.

545
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,273
在你給我的信當中
In the letter you wrote me.

546
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,998
你說我可悲
You said I was pathetic.

547
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,869
嗯
Mmm.

548
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,308
你不記得了嗎?
You don't remember?

549
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,710
你說了一堆中層管理人員
You went on about middle management,

550
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,997
做交易, 紙老虎
making a deal, paper tiger.

551
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,153
Howard, 那才過不久
Oh, Howard, it wasn't that long ago.

552
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,476
你從哪拿到的?
Where did you get that?

553
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,316
- 你是誰?   - 你寫給誰?
- Who are you?   - Who did you write the letter to?

554
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,159
我寫給死亡
I wrote the letter to Death.

555
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,038
很高興認識你, 我肯定你被迷倒了
Nice to meet you. Charmed, I'm sure.

556
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,314
不
No.

557
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,240
我明白
I know, I know.

558
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,550
人們經常寫信給宇宙
People write letters to the universe all the time.

559
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,551
大部份都沒有得到答覆
Most don't get a personal response.

560
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,070
但你有, 因為我只想告訴你, 你錯了
But you are, because I just wanted to tell you that you're wrong.

561
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,037
我不是甚麼沒作為的中層管理人員
I'm not some powerless middle management

562
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,520
- 還有只跟從指令   - 小姐
- just following orders.   - Miss...

563
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,075
我不想做交易, 是我決定的
You see, I didn't want to make the trade. It was my call.

564
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,231
我不想聽你說
I don't want this. I don't want this.

565
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,040
我沒有對你的工作指指點點
Now, I don't tell you how to do your job.

566
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,112
所以我也希望你別教我如何工作
So, I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell me how to do mine.

567
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,634
那個男人在跟誰說話? 他看起來有點怪
Who's that man talking to? He looks kind of weird.

568
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,951
別擔心, 有時候人們做些不能理解的事
Don't worry about that. Sometimes people are silly.

569
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,714
你看, 他們看不到我存在, 直到輪到他們
You see, they don't see me till it's their time.

570
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,996
沒事的, Howard, 還沒輪到你
Oh, it's okay, Howard. It's not your time yet.

571
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,713
我只想交還你這個
I just wanted to return this

572
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,594
並且解決我們之間的恩怨
and clear things up between us.

573
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,040
我真的是死亡, Howard
I really am Death, Howard!

574
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,440
他信了
He believed me.

575
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,232
我告訴你, 他信了
I'm telling you he believed me.

576
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,834
- 真棒   - 那非常精彩
- That's amazing.   - I mean, that was spectacular.

577
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,616
因為沒有第二次機會
Because there was no safety net, you see.

578
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,040
那真的太Grotowski了 [一名導演]
That... That... That was Grotowski.

579
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,634
- 那簡直是Stella Adler [演員]   - 對
- That was pure Stella Adler!   - Ah!

580
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,800
- 謝謝你給予我這個機會   - 對
- Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity.   - Yes.

581
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,016
- 你真是個好人   - 不成問題
- You are a kind man.   - Oh, not a problem.

582
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,856
- 他信了, 我告訴你   - 我不會這麼肯定
- He believed me, I'm telling you.   - I wouldn't go that far.

583
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,096
他需要這個, 我可以從他的眼睛裡看到
But he needed it. I could tell. I could tell in his eyes.

584
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,416
那個女人和小男孩是誰? 時機很棒
Who was that woman and that little boy? That was incredible.

585
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,576
那是我們的私家偵探和她的孫子
Oh, that was our private investigator and her grandson.

586
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,750
真的? 她有說我的演出怎樣嗎?
Oh, really? And did she say anything about me?

587
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,797
她說你很好
She said you were good. She said really good.

588
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,296
好? 甚麼意思? 像...
"Good"? What do you mean? Good like...

589
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,436
像捲心菜一樣好還是甚麼?
You mean good like cabbage is good, or what?

590
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,636
不不, 她...出色
No, no. She... Great.

591
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,315
她說:她將不可能化為可能
She said, she said, "She made the impossible possible."

592
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,835
我該給你錢
I should be paying you.

593
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,470
他們當時告訴我Trevor已收拾好他的包袱
They told me that Trevor had packed his little suitcase,

594
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,830
他說他要回家了
that he said he was going home.

595
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,159
我憤怒極了
I was furious.

596
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,829
但他在睡, 所以我沒有跟他說話
But he was sleeping, so I couldn't talk to him.

597
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,630
甚麼樣的護士會答應一個正在慢慢死去的五歲小男孩
I mean, what nurse promises this dying five-year-old little boy

598
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,438
他能回家?
he could go home?

599
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,834
他幾乎沒剩多少白血球
He barely had any white blood cells left.

600
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,318
他很脆弱
He was so fragile.

601
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,631
誰能這麼殘忍呢?
And who could be so cruel?

602
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,919
誰能對他撒謊呢?
Who could do that?

603
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,912
所以當然, 我失控了
So, of course I'm frantic.

604
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,471
我對職員大聲責罵, 只想尋根究底
I am shouting at the staff, trying to get to the bottom of it.

605
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,394
Trevor終於醒了
Well, Trevor finally wakes up

606
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,755
我走上前
and I go to him.

607
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:31,029
他的藍色包包還放在床尾
You know, his little blue suitcase was still at the edge of the bed, right.

608
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,559
我看著他並問
So, I look at him and ask,

609
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,676
誰跟你說的, 寶目?
"Who said that to you, sweetie?

610
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,393
誰說你可以回到我們的房子?
"Who said that you could come back to our house?"

611
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,672
你知道他怎樣回答嗎?
You know what he says?

612
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,877
沒有人, 媽媽
"Nobody, Mommy.

613
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,954
我不是回我們的房子
"I'm not going back to our house.

614
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,233
我是回我所屬之處
"I'm going home."

615
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,435
他四小時後過世了
He died four hours later.

616
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,839
你好
Hello.

617
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,314
你好
Hi.

618
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,429
你在找"小翅膀支援團隊"嗎?
Are you looking for Smallest Wings Support Group?

619
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,913
嗯...
Um...

620
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,838
- 對   - 你是?
- Yes.   - And you are?

621
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,078
- Howard   - Howard
- Um, Howard.   - Howard.

622
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,510
進去坐下吧
Come on in. Have a seat.

623
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,951
你失去了孩子嗎, Howard?
Did you lose a child, Howard?

624
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,959
對
Yeah.

625
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,633
- 男還是女?   - 啊...
- Boy or girl?   - Uh...

626
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,109
女兒
A girl.

627
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,479
那她的名字是?
And what was her name?

628
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,675
沒關係, Howard
No, it's okay. Howard.

629
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,631
你不必回答
You don't have to answer.

630
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,279
你甚至不需要說話
You don't even have to talk, okay?

631
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,592
可以留下嗎?
You stick around?

632
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,308
拜託?
Please?

633
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,274
好了
Okay.

634
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,998
謝謝你的分享
Thank you so much for sharing.

635
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,548
我們都很感謝
We really appreciate it.

636
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,720
謝謝
Thank you.

637
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,988
有人想要分享甚麼嗎?
Does anybody have anything else they'd like to say?

638
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,512
- 你今晚為何打算進來?   - 嗯?
- So, why'd you decide to come in tonight?  - Hmm?

639
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,357
我以前看過你站在外面
Yeah, I've... I've seen you outside.

640
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,353
我早晚打算邀請你進來
I was gonna come out one night and invite you in,

641
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,476
但我猜我不想暴露你的隱藏位置
but I guess I didn't want to blow up your spot.

642
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,030
暴露我的隱藏位置?
Blow up my spot?

643
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,191
- 對   - 你不想打亂我的節奏?
- Yeah.   - You didn't want to mess up my jam?

644
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,153
正是
Exactly.

645
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,869
你叫甚麼?
What's your name?

646
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,589
我是Madeline
I'm Madeline.

647
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,758
很高興認識你
Nice to meet you.

648
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,032
我女兒叫Olivia
My daughter's name was Olivia.

649
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,755
她因為一種叫膠質母細胞瘤的罕有腦癌而過世
She died of a rare form of brain cancer
known as Glioblastoma Multiforme,

650
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,239
或簡稱GBM
or GBM for short.

651
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,152
她當時六歲
She was six years old.

652
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,917
你的女兒叫甚麼, Howard?
What was your daughter's name, Howard?

653
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,399
好吧
Okay.

654
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,552
不要緊, 別回答, 我不想折磨你
Fine. Don't answer. I'm not gonna torture you.

655
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,113
謝謝
Thank you.

656
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,794
- 是因為節日嗎?   - 嗯?
- Was it the holidays?   - Mmm?

657
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,871
你今晚進來的原因
Why you decided to come in tonight.

658
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,838
有很多第一次來的人都是在節日期間
We get a lot of first-timers during the holidays.

659
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,389
- 不, 不是因為這個  - 那為甚麼是今晚?
- No, that's not it.   - Then why tonight?

660
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,914
我想...
Uh, I guess...

661
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,480
我...
I'm, uh...

662
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,912
我在試著解開心結
I'm trying to fix my mind.

663
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,870
你失去了孩子, Howard
You lost a child, Howard.

664
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,471
你的心結永遠都會在
It'll never be fixed.

665
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,951
我希望你會再來
I hope you come back.

666
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,480
嗨
Hey.

667
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,910
這是簽妥了的合約和保密協議
Signed contracts and confidentiality agreements.

668
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,355
- 太好了, 謝謝   - 所以他有說甚麼嗎?
- Oh, great. Thank you. - So, did he say something?

669
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,834
誰啊? Howard?
Who, Howard?

670
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,761
- 不幸的, 沒有   - 他信了
- No. Unfortunately, he didn't. - He believed it, I'm telling you.

671
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,616
- 那真是太好了  - 或許你該再派我去了
- Oh, that's good. - Maybe you should send me in again.

672
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,676
而不是Raffi, 他太急躁了
Not Raffi. Raffi's too impetuous.

673
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,671
還有Amy, 她太感情用事
And Amy, she's just so emotional.

674
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,512
除了我, 還有誰?
After me, what is there?

675
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,113
他共寫了三封信
Well, he did write three letters.

676
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,276
但死亡比時間重要多了
But Death is so much more vital than Time.

677
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,954
- 對   - 死亡給予時間意義
 - Right.   - Death gives Time all of its value.

678
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,879
或許全都該由我扮演
Maybe... Maybe I should play all the parts.

679
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,670
你知道現時人口統計中的新任父母的數字比以往高吧?
You know the highest margin demographic is new parents now?

680
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,320
他們製造出一條算法
Target actually invented an algorithm

681
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,576
去推算他們的女性客戶何時會懷孕
to predict when their female customers were gonna get pregnant.

682
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,875
你之前說過你不適
You said before that you weren't okay.

683
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,519
你患病了嗎?
Are you sick?

684
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,188
對
I'm sick.

685
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,712
你可以說我的病情非常嚴重
You could say, uh, I'm very sick.

686
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,199
你要死了嗎?
You're dying?

687
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,199
每個人都在死去
Everyone's dying.

688
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,196
對, 但你時日無多
Yeah, but you're doing it now.

689
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,075
Simon. Simon.
Simon. Simon.

690
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,872
來吧, 告訴我, 是甚麼病? 有甚麼不對勁了?
Come on, tell me. Tell me. What is it? What's wrong?

691
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,758
有甚麼不對勁?
What's wrong?

692
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,235
就是我病情惡化了
What's wrong is that I came out of remission

693
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,913
在我兒子出生前的兩週
two weeks before my son was born.

694
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,794
是我
What's wrong

695
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,520
每天都要裝作我還很健康
is that I'm running a marathon every day pretending to be healthy.

696
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,948
那就是不對勁的地方
That's what's wrong.

697
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,313
你有跟誰說過嗎?
Have you told anyone?

698
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,554
沒有?
You haven't?

699
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,793
沒有, 就一個我幾乎不認識卻又不斷質問我的女演員
No, just some pushy actress that I don't really know.

700
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,436
甚麼病?
What is it?

701
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,149
是多發性骨髓瘤
It's multiple myeloma.

702
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,710
我16歲時發病, 25歲又重發
I fought it when I was 16, and then again when I was 25.

703
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,195
它從沒離開過
It just never went away.

704
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,954
反而組織起來變得更強
Instead it regrouped and got stronger.

705
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,191
所以沒法醫治?
So, the war's over?

706
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,396
對
Yeah, war's over.

707
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,874
你的身後事處理好了嗎?
Are your affairs in order?

708
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,908
沒有
My affairs are not in order.

709
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,477
所以我聘請了你
That's why I hired you.

710
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,640
我要離開我的家人已經夠壞了
It's bad enough that I'm leaving my family.

711
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,751
我不會讓他們之後身無分文
I'm not gonna leave them penniless.

712
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,799
他信了我
He believed me.

713
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,675
Howard.
Howard.

714
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,149
他信了我
He believed me.

715
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,598
抱歉, 別碰
Hey. Excuse me. No, don't touch that.

716
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,313
我不明白骨牌
I don't understand dominoes.

717
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,836
沒有計分牌, 或者一個籃框
There's no board to play them on, or basket to throw them into.

718
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,353
對
Right. Um...

719
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,120
我想你去錯地方了
I think you might be in the wrong place.

720
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,991
不, 我沒去錯, Howard
No, I'm in the right place, Howard.

721
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,469
對吧
Mmm. Yeah.

722
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,556
致時間, 人們說你是一切傷害的良藥
"Time, they say you heal all wounds,

723
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,917
但他們不會說起你如何將一切美好化為腐朽
"but they don't talk about how you destroy
all that's good in the world.

724
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,592
如何將美麗的事物化作塵埃
"How you turn beauty into ash."

725
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,478
那真是一派胡言, Howard
Now that's some bullshit, Howard.

726
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,236
如果愛情是創造而死亡是破壞
If Love is creation and Death is destruction,

727
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,310
我就只是他們兩者之間
I'm just a terrain in between.

728
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,192
你不了解時間, 沒有人了解時間
You don't understand Time. No one understands Time.

729
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,158
愛因斯坦幾乎弄清, 他說我是幻想
I mean, Einstein came close when he said I was an illusion.

730
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,514
Howard? 嘿
Howard? Hey. Uh...

731
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,869
聽著, 我很肯定你會回答"不"
Listen, I'm sure it's a "no"

732
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,032
但Oneida Apparel服裝公司要求你在會議出現
but Oneida Apparel asked that you be in the media buy meeting.

733
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,918
很抱歉我阻礙了你
I'm sorry to just barge in.

734
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,793
問她
Ask her.

735
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,713
問她能不能看到我
Go ahead. Ask her if she can see me.

736
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,320
我不會在會議出現
I'm not gonna be in the meeting.

737
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,392
嗯哼
Mmm-hmm.

738
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,754
他們堅持要我問你
Well, they insisted I ask.

739
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,616
他們很可能會跟我們解約, 所以...
I mean, they're probably gonna fire us, so...

740
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,675
好吧
Okay.

741
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,989
- 太好了   - 我去
- Awesome.   - Yes.

742
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,195
好吧
Okay.

743
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,559
晚點見
See you later.

744
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,232
你可以拿回這個, Howard
You can have this back, Howard.

745
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,231
你到底為何寫信給我?
Why did you write me anyway?

746
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,913
是因為你需要我
You wrote me because you need me.

747
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,399
不
No. Um...

748
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,397
我不需要你, 明白嗎?
I don't need anything from you, okay?

749
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,636
你們都喜歡埋怨
You all like to bitch and complain.

750
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,631
不夠時間
"There isn't enough time."

751
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,677
人生苦短
"Life is short."

752
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,910
看, 白髮都出來了
"Oh, here, the gray hairs are coming in."

753
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,911
一天其實長得很
You know, a day is long as hell.

754
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,958
我非常充沛, 我是份禮物
I'm abundant. I'm a gift.

755
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,315
即使現在你站在這裡抱怨
Even while you're standing here talking shit,

756
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,914
也是份禮物, 而你浪費了
I'm gifting you, and you're wasting it.

757
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,120
用在甚麼上了?
On what?

758
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,952
這是甚麼?
I mean, what is this? Huh?

759
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,279
嘿!
Hey, hey!

760
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,635
你知道嗎You know,

761
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,268
我才應該寫信埋怨
I should be the one that's writing angry letters.

762
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,916
那是我做過最差勁的一件事
That was the worst thing I've ever done.

763
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,076
那是我做過最好的一件事
That was the best thing I've ever done.

764
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,073
你剛才說甚麼愛因斯坦?
What was that thing you said about Einstein in there?

765
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,630
愛因斯坦說時間是固執又堅持的幻像
Einstein called time a stubbornly persistent illusion.

766
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,239
那究竟是甚麼?
What's that even mean?

767
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,676
時間不是從一月走到十二月
Time doesn't go from January to December,

768
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,478
或從早到晚
or from noon to midnight.

769
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,915
那只是人類的觀點
You know, we all just make it that way in our heads.

770
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,793
荒謬至極
That's absurd.

771
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,758
你試著跟一個在婚禮上遲到的人說這個
Try telling that to a person who's an hour late to a wedding

772
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,708
或是跟一個剛被判20年監牢的人說
or was just sentenced to 20 years in jail.

773
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,360
或是一個快更年期的女人
Or someone fighting a baby clock.

774
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,988
我們其實不需要交心
We really don't need to have this conversation, ever.

775
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,317
無論如何
Anyway, just...

776
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,119
你今天做得很好
Yeah, wanted to say great job today.

777
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,150
只是個固執的幻像, Claire
Just a stubborn illusion, Claire.

778
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,992
你還有很多時間
You have all the time in the world.

779
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,959
你是九點
You're nine!

780
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,839
你是九點
"You're nine."

781
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,480
你好
Hi.

782
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,431
抱歉
I'm sorry.

783
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,755
很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

785
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,955
你一定在開玩笑吧
You gotta be friggin' kidding me.

786
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,473
我在用餐
I'm eating.

787
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,878
你說了再見, 而那...
You said goodbye, and that...

788
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,399
我們沒有選擇愛誰和被誰愛的權利
We don't get to choose who we love or who loves us back.

789
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,536
那代表你只要還在世就無法對我做甚麼
And that means you're powerless to me as long as you're alive

790
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,312
因為我是生命的基本
because I'm the fabric of life.

791
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,074
我在你當中, 我在萬物當中
I'm within you. I'm within everything.

792
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,835
Howard,
Howard,

793
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,232
如果你能接受, 那可能...
if you can accept that, then maybe...

794
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,109
我不知道, 但你可能可以重新過活
I don't know, but maybe you get to live again.

795
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,516
我失敗了
I completely screwed it up.

796
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,479
我太悲哀和充滿了歉意
I was weepy and apologetic.

797
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,480
我認為愛也可以是那樣
Well, I think love can be weepy and apologetic.

798
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,880
我想我最後還算可以
I think I was better at the end.

799
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,634
嘿, 我肯定你盡力了
Hey, hey. I'm sure you were great.

800
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,399
你真好
You're sweet.

801
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,600
我可以吻你嗎?
Can I kiss you?

802
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,398
你不需要將它性化
You don't have to sexualize it.

803
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,029
我可以不性化地吻你
I can kiss you without sexualizing it.

804
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,470
真的, 我試過沒有性愛的性
Seriously, I've had sex without sexualizing it.

805
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,437
你應該停在"好"的階段, Whit
You should take "sweet", Whit.

806
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,194
算是升職了
It's a promotion.

807
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,351
無法抗拒才算是升職
"Irresistible" would be a promotion.

808
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,320
他信了
He believes it.

809
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,833
你怎知道?
How could you tell?

810
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,758
我從他的眼中看到
I could tell by his eyes.

811
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,912
很好, 但除了你沒人看到
That's great, but no one else has seen it

812
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,040
而那終究是我們的目的
and that's ultimately what we need to have happen.

813
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,271
我們認為你們該再接觸他
We think if you would engage with him

814
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,273
- 在公眾場合   - 很好了
- one more time, um, in public.   - Great.

815
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,113
但這次試著...
But this time try to...

816
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,794
但你們需要挑釁讓他有很大的舉動
But you need to provoke a strong visible reaction.

817
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:04,960
為甚麼?
Why?

818
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,118
因為我們的私家偵探會錄影
Because our private investigator's gonna capture it on video.

819
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,456
並用來做證據
And we're gonna use it as evidence.

820
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,720
那就好像拍電影
It'll be like being in a movie.

821
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,200
除了會後期加工將你們除去
Except you'll be digitally removed.

822
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:14,920
不要
No.

823
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,320
甚麼?
Sorry?

824
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,629
太激烈了
This is too intense.

825
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,456
抱歉, 我不能繼續
Um, I'm sorry. I can't be a part of this.

826
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,313
Amy, 演戲裡沒有甚麼叫"激烈"
Amy, there is no "too intense" in acting.

827
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,552
你想被愛還是被記住?
Do you wanna be loved or do you wanna make an impact?

828
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,154
這不是Noël Coward [演員]
I mean, this isn't Noël Coward.

829
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,753
這是...Chekhov [短篇小說家]
This is... This is Chekhov.

830
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,148
這是荒謬!
This is horrible!

831
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,438
你知道的
The... You know,

832
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,791
你曾經跟他一起創辦那間機構吧, Whit?
you did start the agency with him, didn't you, Whit?

833
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,393
Claire, 他是你的導師
And, Claire, he was your mentor.

834
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,273
Simon, 他讓你成為持有人
And, Simon, he gave you part ownership in a business

835
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,072
而他完全沒有必要
when he absolutely didn't have to.

836
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,976
我跟她說過了點我們的事
I may have told her a few things...

837
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,200
我們...
when we were...


838
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,680
抱歉, 這不能接受
I'm sorry, this is horrible.

839
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,976
我不能...參與其中, 謝謝
I... I can't...No, I can't be a part of this. Thank you.

840
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,040
- 抱歉, 謝謝了   - Amy, 別走
- Sorry. Thanks.   - Amy, no.

841
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,195
Amy.
Amy.

842
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,360
Amy, 別走
Amy. No.

843
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,880
她太多心了
Oh, she's so passionate, you know.

844
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Amy!
Amy!

845
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,112
抱歉, 她會回來的
I'm so sorry. She will be back.

846
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,271
但如果她不回來
But if she isn't, um,

847
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,512
我會介入, 我很熟悉愛情
I'll step in. I do know all about love.

848
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,194
Amy!
Amy!

849
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,955
我錯過了甚麼?
What'd I miss?

850
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,550
人們都在為他們死去的孩子們哭
People crying because their kids died.

852
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,038
有種病叫喪失性幻覺
Uh, there's a thing called bereavement hallucinations.

853
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,360
對
Yes.

854
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,754
對
Right. Um. Okay.

855
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,349
所以...
So, uh...

856
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,118
我查了一下
I looked them up.

857
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,788
有點東西我明白, 我不睡覺的
And here's the thing. I don't sleep.

858
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
是的
Okay.

859
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,077
不太睡覺
Like, not a lot.

860
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,719
我會睡
I mean, I sleep.

862
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,712
但可能一星期只睡六, 七小時
But I get six or seven hours a week.

863
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,196
現在我回想起來, 那可能就是為甚麼...
Now that I think about it, that's probably why...

864
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,360
甚麼為甚麼?
Why what?

866
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,070
我在談話
I'm having conversations.

868
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,159
我指, 談話
I mean, conversations.

869
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,239
對
Okay.

870
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,838
沒關係了
It's okay. Never mind. Um...

871
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,270
- Howard?   - 是
- Howard?   - Yeah.

872
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,951
你想跟我談話嗎?
You wanna have a conversation with me?

873
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,039
是
Uh, yes.

874
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,592
所以我可以假設你是那79%之一?
So, I assume you're a part of the 79%?

875
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,955
嗯?
Mmm?

876
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,034
79%夫婦喪子後會離婚
Of couples who get divorced after losing a child.

877
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,992
對
Yeah.

879
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,793
對, 我也是
Yeah, me too.

880
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,959
你還愛她嗎?
Do you still love her?

881
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,108
我甚至已經不知道甚麼是愛
I don't even know what love is anymore.

882
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,112
你還愛他嗎?
Do you still love him?

883
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,038
我們從沒停止愛過對方
We never fell out of love.

884
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,155
至少, 我不認為, 只是...
At least, I don't think so. It's just...

885
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,429
我們可以...
We can...

886
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,637
我們辦妥了離婚手續的那天, 他給了我這個
The day our divorce was final, he sent me this.

887
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,913
如果我們可以重新相遇一次就好了
"If only we could be strangers again."

888
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,752
現在我們是
Now we are.

889
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,709
這是他做過最浪漫的舉動
The most romantic gesture he ever made.

890
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,230
所以, 回答你剛才的問題
So, to answer your question,

891
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,909
對
yes,

892
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,513
我還愛著他
I still love him.

893
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,758
你甚麼意思
What did you mean

894
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,616
當你說你在談話?
when you said you were having conversations?

895
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,640
對
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

896
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,756
跟誰談話?
Conversations with who?

897
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,953
不是誰
It's not "who."

898
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,348
那真是...
It's really... It's...

899
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,511
你會以為我瘋了
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

900
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,680
說一下
Try me.

901
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,996
我可以帶你去看嗎?
Um, can I show you?

902
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:03,349
不會分解的壞死組織
"Dead tissue that won't decompose."

903
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,471
他那時就坐在這裡
He was sitting right here.

904
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:11,037
就是個說話刻薄又驕傲的小流氓
Just a mean, little, arrogant thug.

905
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,672
他是第一個出現的吧?
And he was the first one that appeared, right?

906
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,031
不, 死亡先出現
Uh, no. Death came first.

907
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,953
她在寵物公園找到我
She met me in the dog park.

908
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,478
所以死亡是個女人?
Oh, so Death is a "her"?

909
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:27,118
對, 原來死亡是個白種婆婆
Uh, yeah. It turns out Death is an elderly white woman.

910
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,393
甚麼交易?
What was the trade?

911
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,754
你說死亡不跟你做交易
You said Death wouldn't make the trade.

912
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,240
甚麼意思?
What does that mean?

913
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,197
當我們意識到...
When we realized our...

914
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:41,839
我的女兒在死去, 我祈禱
My daughter was dying, I prayed, uh...

915
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:47,039
不是向上帝或者宇宙, 而是向死亡
Not to God or the universe, but to Death.

916
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,918
我提出一個交易
I offered a trade.

917
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,752
帶走我
Take me,

918
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,592
留下我的女兒
leave my daughter.

919
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:59,073
但死亡不想交易, 所以...
But she didn't wanna make the trade, so...

920
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,278
所以誰贏了那回合?
So, who won that round?

921
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,357
你還是瓷器?
You or the porcelain?

922
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,432
瓷器, 它從未輸過
Porcelain. Porcelain's undefeated.

923
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,754
抱歉, 我以為所有人都走了
I'm sorry about that, I thought everyone left.

924
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,115
對, 他們走了, 但我還沒
Yes, they did. But I'm here to close up.

925
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,315
很好
Good.

926
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,600
你需要我幫手帶你回家嗎?
You need help getting home?

927
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,473
不, 我沒事
No. I'm fine.

928
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,592
我很好
I'm... I'm good.

929
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,388
我搜尋了你
I Googled you.

930
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,600
- 你搜尋了?   - 對
- You did?   - Yeah.

931
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,760
天啊
Oh, God.

932
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,791
從一無所有
You came from nothing.

933
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,636
捱過杜克大學
You put yourself through Duke,

934
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,156
娶了個美麗的女人
you married a wonderful woman,

935
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,594
是個很有愛心的父親
you're a loving father.

936
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,990
你活得不錯, 你活過了
So, you lived well. You lived right.

937
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,468
但朋友, 你現在這樣是不對的
But, my friend, you're not dying right.

938
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,638
你打算告訴我如何死嗎?
Are you gonna tell me how to die?

939
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,353
你跟你的家人說過了嗎?
Have you told your family yet?

940
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,675
- 沒   - 你這不是在幫他們
- Mmm-mmm.   - You're not helping them.

941
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,753
你只是在否定他們得知真相的權利
You're just denying them what is rightfully theirs.

942
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,239
是嗎? 甚麼真相?
Yeah? And what's that?

943
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,914
痛苦? 萎縮? 疾病?
Pain? Atrophy? Disease?

944
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,513
對, 正是
Yes. Yes.

945
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,159
全部都是
All of it.

946
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,988
還有告別的機會
And the chance to say goodbye.

947
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,669
還是專注演出吧
Stick to acting.

948
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,753
好了
Okay.

949
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,633
我有件我從沒跟別人說過的事
I have something that I haven't told anyone.

950
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,676
不關於信或天使或者甚麼
It doesn't involve letters or angels or anything like that,

951
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,154
但它對我意義重大
but it means something to me.

952
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:56,233
他們當時在準備告別Olivia
They were preparing Olivia to say goodbye.

953
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:01,233
我的丈夫在停車場嘗試讓我母親冷靜下來
And my husband was trying to calm my mother in the parking lot

954
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,237
因為她完全不能接受
because she lost it.

955
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,837
所以我當時獨自一人
So I was alone

956
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,672
坐在
and I was sitting there 

957
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,796
布碌崙瑪摩利醫院的等候室
in the waiting room at Maimonides Hospital.

958
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,872
那裡有個女人坐在我旁邊
And there was this woman who sat next to me.

959
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,793
她問我我要失去誰了
And she asked me who I was about to lose.

960
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,752
我告訴了她
And I told her.

961
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,396
然後她看著我並說
And she looked at me and she said,

962
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,914
記著留意
"Just be sure to notice

963
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,230
附屬的美麗
"the collateral beauty."

964
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,035
她...
I mean, she...

965
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,074
她說得很隨口
She said it so casually.

966
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,992
一牆之隔
In the next room,

967
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,235
我的六歲女兒正在被拆下維持生命的機器
my six-year-old daughter was being taken off life support.

968
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,873
而那女人說附屬的美麗
And this woman says "collateral beauty."

969
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,514
人們都不知道那種時候該說甚麼
People don't know what to say in those moments.

970
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,433
不, 她知道
No, she did.

971
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,155
只是當時我沒有意會到
I just didn't get it at the time.

972
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,997
那不是因為同情我或者氣氛尷尬
See, it wasn't said out of sympathy or awkwardness.

973
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,515
那是經驗之談
It was from experience.

974
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,312
約一年後
About a year later,

975
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,949
有些事開始發生在我身上了
something started to happen to me, you know.

976
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,993
我會在街上或地下鐵走著
I would be walking or on the subway, whatever,

977
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,720
然後突然大哭起來
and I would just burst into tears.

978
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,598
但那不是為Olivia留下的淚
But these weren't Olivia tears.

979
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,718
那是因為有東西重生了而留
These were tears born from something else,

980
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,120
因為對一切深刻的連繫而留
from this kind of profound connection to everything.

981
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,513
然後我意識到了
And I realized

982
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,270
那就是附屬的美麗
it was the collateral beauty.

983
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,833
那真是...
I mean, there's...

984
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:58,151
世上沒有一種叫附屬的美麗
There's no such thing as collateral beauty.

985
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,958
有的, Howard
There is, Howard.

986
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,678
真的有
There really is.

987
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,670
雖然那不會讓她活過來
It'll never bring her back.

988
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:12,677
也不會讓我忘掉一切
And it will never ever make it okay.

989
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,919
但我保證你, 它真的存在
But I promise you, it's there.

990
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,033
好吧
Okay.

991
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,990
你需要跟他們說話, Howard
You need to talk to them, Howard.

992
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,354
聽著
Look, um...

993
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,320
很感謝你分享的故事
Appreciate your story,

994
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,358
但我沒有感覺到這附屬美麗
but I'm not really feeling the "collateral beauty" thing.

995
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,839
我不在乎
I don't care!

996
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,997
對他們呼喊, 跟他們說道理, 挑戰他們
Yell at them, reason with them, challenge them.

997
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,991
就試著接觸他們
Just engage!

998
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,870
我想這一切都是錯誤的
I think this was a mistake.

999
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,068
- 你好   - 你好
- Hi.   - Hi.

1000
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,117
你在這裡做甚麼?
What're you doing here?

1001
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,158
Brigitte告訴我在這裡可以找到你
Uh, Brigitte told me this is where I could find you.

1002
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,548
當然吧
Of course she did.

1003
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,592
我們可以走走, 聊聊天?
Could we just go and talk somewhere for 15 minutes by ourselves?

1004
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,880
我其實在工作, 我在排練
I'm... I'm actually working. I'm rehearsing right now.

1005
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,638
- 你在這裡也排練?   - 對
- You're rehearsing here, too?  - Yeah.

1006
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,720
你同時間在做多少工作?
How many projects are you doing at the same time?

1007
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,508
現時的話三件
I'm currently doing three.

1008
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,720
三件, 嘩
Three. Wow.

1009
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,040
- 對   - 一定很忙
- Yeah.   - That's really busy.

1010
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,720
那我們哪有時間去吃晚餐?
How are we gonna fit a dinner date in?

1011
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,760
Whit...
Whit...

1012
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,116
聽著, 真的
Listen, listen, listen. Seriously...

1013
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:47,195
我想讓你重新考慮你昨晚所說的
I have to ask you to reconsider what you said last night.

1014
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,154
我們需要你再一次的幫忙
We need you one more time.

1015
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,639
就一場戲
Just give us one more scene.

1016
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,478
我不會去的
I am out.

1017
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:54,640
Amy, 你想要...
Amy, what do you...

1018
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,280
等下, 我可以說甚麼? 你想要...
Wait, what can I say? What do you...

1019
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,150
事成我會給你$100,000, 不是20,000
I'll give you $100,000. Not 20, 100.

1020
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,912
你沒有$100,000
You don't have $100,000.

1021
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,520
對, 我跟我母親一起住
You're right. I live with my mother.

1022
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:05,360
但這會成事的, 而完成後, 我會有很多錢
But this is gonna work, and when it does, I'll have much, much more.

1023
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,640
我會給你一百萬
And I'll give you a million.

1024
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,400
- 我不想要你的錢   - 我真的會
- I don't want your money.   - I really will.

1025
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,480
我不想要你的錢
I do not want your money.

1026
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,640
你知道嗎, 我從不想要你的錢
Do you know, I've actually never wanted your money.

1027
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,718
我到底要說甚麼才能讓你回來?
What can I say to get you to do this?

1028
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,792
因為有太多緊急的事要處理, 你甚至不會想到
Because there's so much more at stake here, you have no idea.

1029
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,274
噢
Oh.

1030
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,592
你有個女兒吧?
You have a daughter, right?

1031
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:22,988
對
Yeah.

1032
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,519
我有說過嗎?
Did we talk about that?

1033
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:28,278
告訴我她出生的那天你的感受
Tell me what it was like the day that she was born.

1034
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,555
甚麼?
What?

1035
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,756
對你而言那是甚麼感受?
What it felt like for you.

1036
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,830
很可怕
Uh, it was scary.

1037
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,236
非常可怕, 我完全不知所措
It was very scary. I was terrified.

1038
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,277
但當他們讓我抱著她
But then they gave her to me

1039
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,433
我感覺到了前所未有的感覺
and I had the most amazing sensation run through me.

1040
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,713
那...我不能說...
It... I can't...

1041
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,109
甚麼? 說完它
What? Finish it.

1042
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,191
那聽起來很愚蠢
It sounds... It's goofy.

1043
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,628
不, 那聽起來不愚蠢
No, it doesn't sound goofy.

1044
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,696
這其實是我第一次感覺到
Do you know, actually, this is the first time that I felt

1045
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,312
我對你的事有興趣
any attraction towards you, whatsoever.

1046
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:01,913
- 真的嗎?   - 是
- Really?   - Yes.

1047
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,837
我看著她, 然後我...
I looked at her and I...

1048
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,709
我意識到我沒有感受到愛意
I realized that I wasn't feeling love.

1049
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,597
我成為了愛
I had become love.

1050
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,114
雖然她現在不再跟我說話
She doesn't talk to me now, though.

1051
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:22,875
她把離婚責怪於我, 她還在生我氣
She blames me for the divorce, and so she's angry at me.

1052
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,269
而...
And...

1053
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,469
這是我值得的下場
I deserve it.

1054
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,351
我跟你做個交易
I'm gonna make you a deal.

1055
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,672
如果你能將這些
If you can take all of this,

1056
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,630
坦白又積極的決心
frankly, aggressive determination

1057
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,749
還有非凡的開放態度
and extraordinary openness

1058
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,792
用在贏回你女兒的心上
and use it on winning your daughter back,

1059
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:48,880
那我就幫你們
then I'll do it.

1060
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,553
約定了
It's a deal.

1061
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,954
你沒感受到嗎?
See, you don't feel that?

1062
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,112
放開我
Oh, wow. Give me my hand back.

1063
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,716
你感受到的吧?
You feel that though, right? You feel it?

1064
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,136
- 那就是火花   - 再見, Whit
- That's sparks.   - Goodbye, Whit.

1065
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,160
那就是火花
That's what that is.

01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:22,870
[律師信]
[關於宏盟集團, 盡快聯絡]

1066
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,870
嗨, 怎樣了?
Hey! What's up?

1067
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,871
- 甚麼?   - 你有點話要說嗎?
- What?   - You got something to say?

1068
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,633
你有點想要說的話吧?
You got something you wanna say?

1069
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,856
對, 我有很多事想告訴你
Oh, yeah. I got a lot of things I'd like to say to you.

1070
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,996
說出來啊!
Well, say it. Say it!

1071
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,472
你就只會浪費時間
See, you just waste time.

1072
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,636
我給予了你這份禮物, 而你就白白浪費它
See, I give you a gift and you just waste it!

1073
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:22,120
我不在乎時間
I don't care about time.

1074
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,158
這是監禁
This is a prison sentence!

1075
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:26,715
我不想要你的所謂禮物
I don't want your gift!

1076
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,310
因為你拿走了她的時間
Because you took hers.

1077
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,879
噢, 又來了
Oh, come on.

1078
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,559
你是來帶我走的嗎?
Are you here to take me?

1079
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,558
不, Howard, 我來這裡跟你一起坐車
No, Howard. I'm here to ride the F train with you.

1080
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,040
好吧
Oh, okay.

1081
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:19,512
我說, 有對龍鳳胎在肚裡
So, there are these two twins in a womb, a boy and a girl.

1082
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:20,908
你在說笑話嗎?
You telling a joke?

1083
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,513
不, 這是個故事
No, no. It's a story.

1084
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,193
這對雙胞胎非常快樂
So, these twins are happy.

1085
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,595
有食物, 又溫暖, 他們感到很安全
They're fed, they're warm, they feel safe.

1086
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,751
但他們越來越大, 不夠位置
But they're outgrowing their space

1087
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,113
他們意識到這不是辦法
and they realize this can't go on forever.

1088
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,872
所以他們開始想
So they start thinking,

1089
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,431
接下來會怎樣?
"What comes next?

1090
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,239
如果變得又冷又寂寞呢?
"What if it's cold or lonely?

1091
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,594
如果我們不再在一起呢?
"What if we're not together?

1092
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,919
如果這根本甚麼都不是呢?
"What if there's nothing at all?"

1093
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,548
然後那女孩看著臍帶
So, then the girl looks at the cord.

1094
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,069
那條一直給他們養分的臍帶
This cord that has fed them, has nourished them,

1095
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,629
那條他們根本不可能猜透的臍帶
this cord that they can't possibly conceive

1096
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,109
很可能連繫在任何東西上
could be attached to anything else.

1097
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,759
然後她說
And she says,

1098
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,559
我們沒有證據
"Well, we have no proof.

1099
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,073
我們只有這個
"All we have is this."

1100
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,440
不
No.

1101
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,439
那真是深奧
Wow, that's deep.

1102
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:10,319
所以就是生命吧
So, it's like life after birth.

1103
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,234
充滿希望
Hopeful.

1104
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,313
你到底想要甚麼?
All right, what do you want?

1105
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,553
你為何來這裡?
Why are you here?

1106
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,631
你的陳詞濫調我都聽膩了
I've heard all of your platitudes.

1107
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,949
我都明白了
I got them, I know.

1108
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,473
她去了更好的地方
"She's in a better place."

1109
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,438
冥冥中自有主宰
And, "This is all a part of a master plan."

1110
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,749
也聽過了
Heard that one, too.

1111
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,109
接下來是我最喜歡的
Here's my favorite.

1112
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,750
上帝從天上看下來, 看見了一朵最美麗的玫瑰花
"God looked down and saw the most beautiful rose,

1113
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,797
太美麗了, 所以他摘下來
"so beautiful that he picked it

1114
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,679
放在天堂裡陪伴他
"to have it in Heaven all for Himself."

1115
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,116
然後就是關於科學, 生物中心主義
Then there's the science, biocentrism,

1116
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:42,636
我們在無數宇宙中誕生和死去
and we're all living and dying in infinite universes

1117
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,472
同時間
all at the same time.

1118
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:45,755
還有宗教
And then the religion,

1119
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,672
基督教和救贖
the Christians and their salvation,

1120
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:51,310
佛教及其輪迴之說, 還有印度教及其聖禮
and the Buddhists and their Samsara,
and the Hindus and their 41 st sacrament.

1121
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:52,959
特別忘不了那些詩句
And can't forget the poetry.

1122
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,519
噢, 那些詩句
Oh, the poetry.

1123
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,672
死並不像一般人所想像的
"To die is different from what anyone supposed

1124
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,034
而是更幸運
"and luckier."

1125
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,315
Whitman. [Walt Whitman - Song of Myself]

1126
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,630
怒斥吧
And, "Rage...

1127
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,597
怒斥光的消逝
"Rage against the dying of the light.

1128
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:08,275
年邁的智者深知黑暗必將來臨
"Though wise men at their end know dark is right."

1129
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,317
[Dylan Thomas - Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night]
Thomas. And then...

1130
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,029
划呀划, 划小船, 緩緩順流下
Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream

1131
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,997
開心呀, 開心呀, 開心呀, 開心吧
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

1132
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:20,676
人生不過一場夢
Life is but a dream

1133
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:21,989
我知道了
I got it.

1134
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,479
我全都明白了!
I got it!

1135
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:29,511
全都在說你是生命的必經的階段
It all basically says that you're a natural part of life,

1136
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,559
我們不該恨你和害怕你
we shouldn't hate you, we shouldn't fear you.

1137
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:36,473
我猜我們該坦然接受你對吧?
I guess we should just accept you, right?

1138
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,039
就這樣?
That's it?

1139
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,636
我明白了, 不過我想說
I get it. Here's the thing.

1140
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:45,318
這全都是讀書人的一派胡言而已
It's all a bunch of intellectual bullshit

1141
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:50,197
因為她此時此地不在
because she's not here holding my fucking hand.

1149
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,393
你好, Howard
Hi, Howard.

1150
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:31,919
你又要哭了嗎?
You gonna cry again?

1151
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:33,680
你不喜歡我傷心時的模樣?
You don't like it when I'm sad?

1152
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,035
- 你不是整天都傷心的嗎?   - 當然不是
- Ah, aren't you always sad?   - No.

1153
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,952
我可以有其他心情, 我可以是快樂
No, I can be other things. I can be happy.

1154
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:41,237
我可以是意想不到和不可預測的
I can be unexpected and unpredictable...


1155
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,755
還有性感, 溫馨, 神秘...
...and sexy and warm and mysterious and...

1156
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,758
和窩心
And home.

1157
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,150
我可以很窩心, Howard, 你記得嗎?
I can be home, Howard, you remember?

1158
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,909
你記得我嗎?
Do you remember me?

1159
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,920
聽著, 那些甚麼"生命的基本", 留給跟別人說吧
Listen. All the "fabric of life" bullshit,
save that for somebody else.

1160
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,075
那不是胡說的
It's not bullshit.

1161
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,880
我知道你不相信我, 但你要給我另一次機會
I know you don't believe me,
but you have to trust me.

1162
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,274
相信你?
Trust you?

1163
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,113
- 相信你?    - 對!
- Trust you?   - Yes!

1164
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,077
我相信過你啊!
I did trust you!

1165
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,552
然而你背叛了我!
And you betrayed me!

1166
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:10,590
我曾經每天都在她的雙眸中看到你
I saw you every day in her eyes,

1167
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:13,913
還有在她的笑聲中
and I heard you in her voice when she laughed,

1168
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:17,436
還有當她叫我爸爸時, 我感覺到你在我裡面
and I felt you inside of me when she called me "Daddy."

1169
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,239
然後你背叛了我!
And you betrayed me!

1170
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,396
你傷透了我的心
You broke my heart.

1171
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,754
不
No.

1172
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,951
我在萬物當中
I'm in all of it.

1173
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,360
我是黑暗同時也是曙光
I'm the darkness and the light,

1174
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,959
我是太陽般溫暖同時也是風暴般難以預測
I'm the sunshine and the storm.

1175
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,120
你說對了
Yes, you're right.

1176
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,952
我存在在她的笑聲中
I was there in her laugh,

1177
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:39,076
但我現在也在你的傷痛之中
but I'm also here now in your pain.

1178
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:43,197
我是萬物的起因
I'm the reason for everything.

1179
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,590
我是唯一的"原因"
I am the only "why."

1180
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,635
別以為沒了我可以生活, Howard
Don't try and live without me, Howard.

1181
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,239
拜託不要
Please don't.

1182
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:37,992
與宏盟集團的協議快要達成了
The deal with Omnicom's almost done.

1183
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:39,999
那Howard那邊呢?
What about Howard?

1184
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,536
他們也注意到現在的情況
Well, they're aware of the situation

1185
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:44,518
但我們仍然要證明Howard
but we still have to prove that Howard's ability to vote

1186
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,200
沒有投票的能力
is, uh, compromised.

1187
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,557
我難以相信變成了這個局面
I can't believe it's come down to this.

1188
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,153
對, 但還是得相信
Yeah, well, believe it.

1189
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:53,439
我們星期四有個跟委員會討論Howard能力的會議
We have a competency meeting with the board set for Thursday.

1190
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:03,991
我們來這裡是給你一個解釋的機會
We're here to give you a chance to explain this.

1191
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,230
Howard, 影片中你在做甚麼?
Howard, what are you doing in this video?

1192
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:12,597
我不在乎時間
I do not care about time.

1193
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,716
這是監禁
This is a prison sentence!

1194
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,270
我不想要你的所謂禮物!
I don't want your gift!

1195
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,000
你在做甚麼, Howard?
What are you doing, Howard?

1196
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,552
因為你拿走了她的時間
Because you took hers.

1197
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,794
Howard?
Howard?

1198
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,632
你又要哭嗎?
You gonna cry again?

1199
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,550
你不是整天都傷心的嗎?
Aren't you always sad?

1200
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:31,789
這段呢?
What about here?

1201
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,920
聽著, 那些甚麼"生命的基本"
Listen. All the "fabric of life" bullshit,

1202
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,518
留給跟別人說吧
save that for somebody else.

1203
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,594
相信你?
Trust you?

1204
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:43,879
相信你?
Trust you?

1205
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,154
我相信過你啊!
I did trust you!

1206
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,390
我把一切托付給你
I committed everything to you

1207
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,471
而你背叛了我!
and you betrayed me!

1208
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:56,597
我曾經每天都在她的雙眸中看到你
I saw you every day in her eyes,

1209
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,559
還有在她的笑聲中
and I heard you in her voice when she laughed.

1210
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,576
我感覺到你在我裡面
And I felt you inside of me...

1211
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,600
Howard?
Howard?

1212
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,233
當她叫我爸爸時
...when she called me "Daddy."

1213
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,400
Howard?
Howard?

1214
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:08,788
你傷透了我的心
You broke my heart.

1215
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:12,077
Howard, 我需要你的答覆, 你在跟誰說話?
Howard, I need you to answer me. Who are you shouting at here?

1216
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:14,536
你的陳詞濫調我都聽過了, 我全都明白了
I've heard all of your platitudes. I got them, I know.

1217
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,120
不是"誰"
Um, it's not "who."

1218
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,856
冥冥中自有主宰
And, "This is all a part of a master plan."

1219
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:19,995
抱歉, 甚麼?
I'm sorry, what?

1220
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,240
我明白了
I got it.

1221
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,749
Howard, 你說了甚麼?
Howard, did you say something?

1222
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,309
我不是在跟人說話
I'm not talking to people.

1223
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:30,109
很明顯, 那你在跟誰說話?
Well, that's obvious. Who are you talking to?

1224
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:35,680
Howard, 你在跟誰說話?
Howard, who are you talking to?

1225
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,030
夠了
That's enough. It's enough.

1226
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,872
謝謝
Thank you.

1227
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:41,959
我想, 你指出了重點
You made the point, I think.

1228
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,871
把它關閉吧
Just turn it off.

1229
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,110
你聘請人去跟蹤我?
You hired people to follow me?

1230
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,519
去錄影?
Make video?

1231
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,830
不, 那不是我們最初的打算
No, that wasn't the initial intention.

1232
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,638
對, 我們這樣做了
No, we did.

1233
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,360
對
Yeah, we did.

1234
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,600
我們除了那還做了很多, Howard
We did a lot more than that, Howard.

1235
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,198
Howard, 很抱歉
Howard, I'm so sorry.

1236
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:13,679
我們覺得...
We felt like...

1237
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,159
我們不知道還可以做甚麼
We didn't know what else to do.

1238
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,709
- Claire.   - 不, 我不能再這樣做了
- Claire.   - No. I can't do this anymore.

1239
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,310
我不能, Whit
I can't do this anymore, Whit.

1240
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,194
聽著, 我真的...
Listen, I really...

1241
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,191
我甚至沒想過那會行得通
I didn't even think that it was gonna work.

1242
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,320
- 真的, 坦白說, 我...   - Claire. Claire. Claire.
- Really, honestly, I...  - Claire. Claire. Claire.

1243
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,078
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

1244
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,600
- 好了好了   - Howard...
- All right, all right, all right.   - Howard...

1245
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:37,193
我很顯現地不在狀態
I'm obviously not in the right state of mind.

1246
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,670
可能我們所有人都不在狀態
Maybe none of us are.

1247
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,831
你以為我沒留意嗎?
You think I haven't noticed?

1248
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:49,832
Claire,
I mean, Claire,

1249
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,278
你奉獻了你整生給這公司
you dedicated your entire life to this agency.

1250
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,237
你讓我們成為一家人
You made us your family

1251
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,709
當你有能力出去闖一番事業的時候
when you could have been starting your own.

1252
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,389
還有, 你一直費盡心思
And, uh, you've been absolutely killing yourself,

1253
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,039
幫我掩飾
covering for me,

1254
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,953
很感謝你
and I appreciate that.

1255
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,954
謝謝
Thank you.

1256
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,551
還有你, Simon
And, Simon,

1257
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,911
你盡力不讓任何人知道
you've done your best to hide it from everyone,

1258
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,718
但我知道你的過去
but I know your history.

1259
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:22,270
我懷疑我在將一個無可挽救的局面
And I suspect I'm making an already impossible situation

1260
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,072
弄得更糟糕
even worse for you.

1261
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,199
我向你保證
I promise you,

1262
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,868
我一日還在
as long as I am here,

1263
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:34,793
你的家庭都會得到照料
your family will be cared for.

1264
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,153
謝謝
Thank you.

1265
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:42,754
Whit
Whit.

1266
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,070
我最好的朋友
Best friend I've ever had.

1267
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:50,554
但我對你很失望
But I'm disappointed in you, man.

1268
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,274
我不是指這個
I mean, not for... Not for this.

1269
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,793
不是這個
Not for this.

1270
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:03,278
你不需要她的允許才當她的父親
You don't need her permission to be her father.

1271
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:11,357
Allison是你生命中最美好的事
Allison's the best thing you got happening in this world,

1272
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,309
人生苦短, 及時行樂
and tomorrow's not promised.

1273
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:20,673
聽到了嗎?
Do you hear me?

1274
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,431
你們做了件正確的事
You guys did the right thing.

1275
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,594
我想我們的公司繼續運作
I want our agency to survive.

1276
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,392
總有些事要繼續吧
Something should.

1277
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,878
好了
All right, um...

1278
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,311
我會簽署的
I'll sign the papers now.

1279
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:45,639
你同意售賣股份
Your approval of the sale.

1280
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,631
另一份呢?
Uh, the other one?

1281
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,195
你給了六通電話都要讓我簽署的那份呢?
The one you called me six times to have me sign.

1282
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,396
我認為你會一同帶來
Um, I assume you have it here with you.

1283
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:08,553
抱歉, Howord
I am sorry, Howard.

1284
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,031
這是件正確的事
This is the right thing.

1285
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:32,439
我告訴你們, 這是件正確的事
I'm telling you, this is the right thing.

1286
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:46,194
抱歉
Excuse me.

1287
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,916
第二份文件是甚麼?
What was that second piece of paper?

1288
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:53,036
Howard把他的部份所有權放到他女兒名下的信托基金
Howard put some of his ownership into a trust in his daughter's name.

1289
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,391
那只是份法律證書表明她已經不在了
It's just a legal certificate saying she's no longer with us.

1290
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:04,596
我想我需要喝一杯
I think I need a drink.

1291
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,991
你還好嗎?
Are you okay?

1292
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:51,070
他們說天堂裡時間的流動
"They say that the time in Heaven

1293
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:56,349
跟我們世界比較起來
"is compared to the blink of an eye

1294
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,670
就是一眨眼的工夫
"for us on this Earth.

1295
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:07,069
有時候我會覺得Adam
"Sometimes I think of Adam 

1296
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:10,193
正在一遍長滿花草的美麗田園裡奔跑
"running through a beautiful field of wild flowers.

01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:14,193
[尋找你的精子捐贈者]

1297
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:23,548
他會是那麼快樂, 忘我地奔跑
"He's so happy, completely caught up in what he's doing.

1298
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,879
然後他會回過頭來
"But then he looks back

1299
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:34,195
像他平常跑在我前面時會做的
"like he used to do when he ran ahead of me

1300
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,874
在機場或市場, 哪裡都好
"in airports or malls or wherever.

1301
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,391
然後他會對著我笑
"And he smiles."

1302
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,080
天啊
Jesus.

1303
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:50,233
因為他的一眨眼已經是我的餘生了
"Because the blink of his eye was the rest of my life

1304
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:54,714
而我還在他背後
"and I'm right there behind him."

1305
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,110
無論如何, 這是我的第一次
Anyway, it's a first draft.

1306
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,593
很美麗的故事
It's beautiful.

1307
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,873
真的很美麗
Really beautiful.

1308
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,435
還有人想要分享嗎?
Does anybody else wanna say anything?

1309
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:16,037
那好吧, 我想今晚就到此為止了
Okay, I guess that's all for tonight.

1310
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,153
謝謝
Thank you.

1311
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,839
抱歉
Sorry, sorry.

1312
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:51,760
喲
Yo!

1313
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,080
簡直不能相信你讓我來到這街區
I can't believe you made me come into this neighborhood

1314
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,276
身上還帶著$20,000現金
carrying $20,000 in cash.

1315
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,313
你要用來做甚麼?
What are you gonna do with it?

1316
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,311
你應該為你的演藝學院儲起來
You should put it aside for acting school.

1317
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,674
你很有演技
You were really good.

1318
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,116
我要用來買狡詐家藥物
Mmm. I'm gonna use it to buy designer drugs.

1319
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,998
那也行
Or that, too.

1320
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,229
對
Yeah.

1321
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:13,309
嘿, 你將會是一個好媽媽
Hey, you gonna make a good mom one day.

1322
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:18,834
是嗎?
Yeah?

1323
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,998
是的, 那是宣傳單張裡沒說的
Yeah, well, that's pretty much not in the cards.

1324
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:24,390
我以前決定了反對科學
I decided against the science

1325
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:28,111
看來時間終於找上門了
and it seems time finally caught up with me.

1326
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:33,719
以前有個賣書套的人在187號街給了我一本叫美麗新世界的書
There was this dust dealer up on 187th who gave me Brave New World.

1327
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,429
那本書讀起來令人樂而忘返
That book turned hours into seconds.

1328
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,272
他是我的父親
He was my father.

1329
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:39,919
還有個無家可歸的女人
And there was this homeless woman

1330
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,150
在大學高地橋下生活
who lived under the University Heights bridge.

1331
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,469
她的名字是Flora
Her name was Flora.

1332
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:47,036
她精神失常, 但她說了最有趣的故事給我
She was batshit crazy, but she told me the greatest stories.

1333
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:48,440
她是我的母親
She was my mother.

1334
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,519
聽著, Claire
See, Claire,

1335
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,830
你的孩子們不一定要由你生出來
your children don't have to come from you.

1336
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,558
他們可以是讓你經過歷練
They go through you.

1337
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:02,670
所以我不會那麼快就考慮跟時間投降
So, I wouldn't consider the battle with time over just yet.

1338
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:05,559
我以為時間不是直線的
I thought time wasn't linear.

1339
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:07,119
我以為它是幻像
I thought it was an illusion.

1340
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:11,712
或者一切都只是廢話而已, Claire
Maybe that was just bullshit, Claire.

1341
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:15,831
或者那只是演戲
Maybe that was just acting.

1342
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:48,269
- 嗨, Allison   - 我們快走吧
- Hey, Allison.   - Come on, let's go.

1343
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:50,558
別這樣, Allison!
Oh. Come on. Allison!

1344
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,593
我晚點跟你們會面
I'll meet you guys there.

1345
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:57,116
你知道我不想跟你說話
I don't wanna talk to you. You know that.

1346
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,360
別煩我
Leave me alone.

1347
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,748
不, 我永遠不會留下你
No. I won't leave you alone.

1348
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,194
- 不會嗎?   - 不會
- No?   - No.

1349
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,755
我知道你在生我的氣, 那很正常
I know you're angry at me, and that's okay.

1350
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:04,960
我承受得到
I can take it.

1351
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:08,590
但我們需要好好談談, 因為那就是家人會做的事
But we gotta talk about it 
because that's what you do in a family.

1352
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,270
所以我每天都會來並在你的朋友面前讓你顯得尷尬
So I'm gonna come here every day
and embarrass you in front of your friends

1353
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:13,475
直到你跟我說話為止
until you talk to me.

1354
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,074
所以你打算跟蹤我?
So you're gonna stalk me?

1355
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,952
對, 基本上是
Well... Yes, basically.

1356
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,416
那如果我申請限制令呢?
Well, what if I get a restraining order?

1357
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,096
我不認為你有能力可以做到
Well, I don't think you're gonna be able to do that.

1358
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:21,473
我會讓媽媽替我付錢
Well, I'll get Mom to pay for it.

1359
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:23,471
跟你說下, 它們是免費的
Well, for your information, they're free.

1360
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:25,278
那我會讓你替我付錢
Well, then I'll get you to pay for it.

1361
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,394
我真的很愛你
I really love you.

1362
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,438
媽媽說你令那個字變質了
Mom says you butcher that word.

1363
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,398
不在我跟你說的時候
Not when I say it to you.

1364
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,353
聽著
Look...

1365
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,478
我沒能力帶著你飛到緬因州吃午餐
I can't fly you to Maine for lunch

1366
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,074
或者用駕著特斯拉來接你
or get you picked up in a Tesla

1367
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:44,470
或者讓你到Anna Wintour旗下實習 [時尚雜誌編輯]
and take you to your internship with Anna Wintour

1368
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,915
或者他們在這街區會做的事
or whatever the hell they do in this neighborhood.

1369
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,989
但我想我們可以坐在公園的長椅上
But I think that you and me can sit on a park bench

1370
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:54,071
說說笑, 享受一段美好時光
and tell jokes and have a pretty good time.

1371
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:58,510
我不能相信你會跟蹤我
I can't believe you're gonna stalk me.

1372
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,714
但...
But, um...

1373
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:06,995
只是說下, 明天只有半天課
Just so you know, tomorrow's a half-day.

1374
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,992
那我明天也會在這裡
Well, I'll be here then.

1375
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:30,989
嗨
Hey.

1376
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:35,553
你的
Here you are.

1377
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:41,239
我等了別人給我的肯定很久了
I've been waiting a long time for my moment for validation,

1378
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,549
這就是我要的
and this was it.

1379
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:46,269
一位在角落不起眼, 也不拍掌的觀眾
An audience of one, in secret, with no applause.

1380
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:56,760
我跟我的妻子說了
I told my wife.

1381
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:58,719
那她怎樣反應?
Oh, how did it go?

1382
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,314
她早就知道了
She knew.

1383
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,356
她在做準備了
She's getting ready for it.

1384
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:10,713
當我還年輕時, 我經常想
You know, when I was younger, I used to think,

1385
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,551
你真的想活到一百歲嗎?
you really wanna live to be 100 years old?

1386
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,071
像乾癟了的葡萄乾一樣
You know, like a shriveled up raisin.

1387
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,552
而我現在會給的答覆是
And the answer to that now

1388
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:22,799
對
is yes.

1389
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:26,351
因為我的兒子將會是70歲
Because my son would be 70,

1390
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:28,593
他的兒子會是40歲
his son would be 40,

1391
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:30,557
他的兒子會是10
and his son would be 10.

1392
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,390
而我就能成為那個人
And I would be the man, you know.

1393
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,319
老爸的角色
Pops.

1394
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:41,756
真想成為啊
Could get used to that, you know.

1395
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,510
再見, 老爸
See you around, Pops.

1396
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:50,276
我真想去看你的話劇
I wish I could be here to see the play.

1397
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,953
不, 那話劇經過是次早就沒了
Oh, no, no. The play is dead after all this.

1398
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,757
但誰知道呢
But you never know,

1399
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:00,037
沒甚麼是死的, 如果以正確的角度去看的話
nothing's ever really dead if you look at it right.

1400
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:46,708
嗨
Hey.

1401
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:48,315
嗨
Hey.

今晚是平安夜
Uh, it's Christmas Eve.

1404
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:55,197
而你只獨身一人
And you're alone.

1405
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:56,520
我自願的
By choice.

1406
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,996
我可以破壞你獨處的時間嗎?
Can I ruin that?

01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:47,992
[最好的媽媽]

1407
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:51,992
你剛才在哭
You've been crying.

1408
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:57,038
我剛才在看我為我女兒拍的影片
I was watching a video I took of my daughter.

1409
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,911
她在跟她的父親跳舞
She's dancing with her father in it.

1410
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,830
我能給你看嗎, Howard?

我女兒叫Olivia
My daughter's name was Olivia.

1412
