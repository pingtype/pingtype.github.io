字幕後期：HDSky

2
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:57,891
瑪格利特
Margaret.

3
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,252
我究竟該拿這個怎麼辦
What the hell am I supposed to do with this?

4
00:01:01,822 --> 00:01:03,781
這是醫囑哦 親愛的
Doctor's orders, honey.

5
00:01:03,822 --> 00:01:05,324
無飽和脂肪攝入
No saturated fat.

6
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:10,830
女士 那是個蹩腳破醫生
Ma'am, that doctor is a hack.

7
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,750
而且他很沒用
And he's pathetic.

8
00:01:14,142 --> 00:01:16,961
他甚至都不該拿到執業證
He shouldn't even have a license.

9
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,339
別再聽那個破醫生的啦
Stop listening to the doctor.

10
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,331
天哪
Jesus.

11
00:01:21,032 --> 00:01:22,867
你讓我吃麵包
You give me bread?

12
00:01:22,926 --> 00:01:24,510
第一 這不是烤的
First of all it's not toasted,

13
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:25,924
第二 這上頭抹的是
second of all it's peanut

14
00:01:25,987 --> 00:01:27,432
沒摻一丁點果醬的花生
butter without any jam.

15
00:01:27,486 --> 00:01:29,515
你想讓我怎麼吃 直接嚥下去
How do you expect me to swallow this or get it down?

16
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:33,034
天曉得 我得跟你說幾次啊
How many goddamn times do I have to tell you that?

17
00:01:33,323 --> 00:01:36,659
別再看那破烹飪書了 好好學學怎麼做
Get your nose out of a cookbook and learn to make

18
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:39,711
花生醬和果醬三明治
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

19
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:41,444
再這麼說下去
Keep talking like that

20
00:01:41,486 --> 00:01:43,696
你就自己去做你那三明治吧
and you'll be making your own sandwiches.

21
00:01:43,948 --> 00:01:45,281
你說什麼
What did you say?

22
00:01:45,745 --> 00:01:47,288
那是啥
What was that?

23
00:01:58,337 --> 00:02:03,618
譯名: 美國暴力
*

24
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:12,743
據全球健康教育協會稱
According to the Global Health Education Consortium,

25
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:15,728
造成暴力的社會原因有很多
there are numerous social causes for violence.

26
00:02:15,993 --> 00:02:16,938
貧窮 失業
Poverty, unemployment,

27
00:02:16,962 --> 00:02:19,732
吸毒以及酗酒 文化準則
illicit drug and alcohol abuse, cultural norms.

28
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:21,317
但這些外部影響
But these external influences

29
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:24,212
並不是造成暴力的根本原因
don't explain the root cause of violence.

30
00:02:30,134 --> 00:02:31,960
德克薩斯州起訴約翰遜
Texas versus Johnson.

31
00:02:31,995 --> 00:02:34,247
埃德·約翰遜在他的前女友
Ed Johnson was charged with first degree murder

32
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:35,915
和她所拜訪的男孩的死後
after the deaths of his ex-girlfriend

33
00:02:35,957 --> 00:02:37,750
被指控一級謀殺
and a boy she was seeing.

34
00:02:38,276 --> 00:02:40,315
由於此罪性質極其惡劣
Because of the heinousness of the crimes,

35
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:41,610
以及受害人的年齡
and the ages of the victims,

36
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:44,257
公訴人想要法官判處他死刑
the prosecutors wanted to push for the death penalty.

37
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:47,351
但因為埃德差幾個月不滿18週歲
But because Ed was a few months shy of turning 18,

38
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:49,029
法官將其駁回
the judge balked.

39
00:02:49,982 --> 00:02:52,526
在服刑僅僅五年後 他就因改過自新
He was released after sewing only five years,

40
00:02:52,763 --> 00:02:54,377
被釋放
for good behavior.

41
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:56,853
假釋後一周
One week after being paroled,

42
00:02:57,198 --> 00:03:00,322
埃德的車 在一次例行交通檢查中被攔停
Ed was pulled over for a routine traffic stop.

43
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,824
警方在他的後備箱裏發現了
And the police found the severed head

44
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:04,080
一個九歲小女孩被割下來的頭顱
of a nine year old little girl in his trunk.

45
00:03:04,454 --> 00:03:07,915
由於這個新發現 埃德被判處死刑
Because of this new discovery, Ed was sentenced to death.

46
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,916
如果州政府在他第一次行兇後
Had the state sentenced him after the first violent act

47
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,877
在那兩條無辜的生命逝去後 就判處他
where two innocent lives were lost,

48
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:15,955
那個小女孩也就能逃過一劫
that little girl would've been spared.

49
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,122
更有意思的是 據其所訴
The most interesting part, is according to his records,

50
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,807
他並沒有精神病
there was no history of mental illness

51
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:22,599
或神經病史
or neurological diseases.

52
00:03:22,618 --> 00:03:24,161
那麼他是天生暴力呢
So was he born violent?

53
00:03:24,398 --> 00:03:25,899
自問一下
Ask yourself that.

54
00:03:26,713 --> 00:03:29,477
現在 由於不清楚暴力產生的根源
Now, without understanding where violence originates,

55
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:31,820
幫助刑滿者 恢復正常生活就是不可能的
it's impossible to rehabilitate,

56
00:03:31,948 --> 00:03:34,252
更別說阻止將來暴力行為的發生
let alone prevent future violent acts.

57
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:37,057
那如果說暴力在我們社會
Well what if violence is

58
00:03:37,096 --> 00:03:38,418
我們美國文化中
so ingrained to our society,

59
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:40,363
-是如此根深蒂固 -抱歉先生
our American culture-- - Excuse me, sir.

60
00:03:40,404 --> 00:03:42,823
以至於暴力的爆發是不可避免的呢
That outbursts are inevitable?

61
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:44,471
這無法避免
There's no escaping it.

62
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:46,318
我不願相信我們遠離
I refuse to believe that we're far from stopping

63
00:03:46,353 --> 00:03:49,106
暴力在全國範圍席捲
the epidemic of violence sweeping through our country.

64
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:50,928
即使是在一個以殺人償命
Even with a system in place

65
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:52,670
的體系內
that just trades death for death?

66
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:59,131
好吧 那麼執行死刑也是暴力行為嗎
Okay, so are controlled executions an act of violence?

67
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:01,665
還是說是對愛著受害者的人 的仁慈行為
Or an act of mercy for the loved ones of the victims?

68
00:04:02,268 --> 00:04:04,145
殺戮不總是暴力的嗎
Isn't the act of killing always violent?

69
00:04:04,428 --> 00:04:05,493
難道是嗎
Is it?

70
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:12,934
我希望你們在接手案件時思考一下
I want you guys to think about that when you pick a case.

71
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:16,107
尋找隱藏的動機 以及遺漏的線索
Look for the hidden motives, and clues that were missed.

72
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:17,593
還有如果這些線索未被遺漏
And had they not been missed,

73
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,318
悲劇就能夠避免嗎
would the tragedy have been prevented?

74
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,028
記得要客觀公正
And remember to be objective.

75
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,822
那是對情況做出準確且
That is the key to get an accurate

76
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:26,367
公正的判斷的關鍵 好嗎
and impartial read on the situation, okay?

77
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,202
下課
Class dismissed.

78
00:04:32,331 --> 00:04:34,333
-您是 -本·伍茲
And you are? - Ben Woods.

79
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,295
地方助理檢察官
Assistant District Attorney.

80
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:43,380
我想 咨詢你一個案件
I'd like for you to consult on a case for me.

81
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:45,525
他名叫傑克·謝伊
His name is Jack Shea,

82
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:47,902
72小時後他將被處死
he's set for execution in 72 hours.

83
00:04:49,014 --> 00:04:50,349
由於今年是選舉年
With it being an election year,

84
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:51,726
政府頂著額外的壓力
the Governor's under extra pressure

85
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:54,770
要重新評估我州在死刑問題上的立場
to reevaluate the State's position on capital punishment.

86
00:04:54,812 --> 00:04:57,273
法律條文的細微差別並不是我的專長
Well the nuances of the law aren't exactly my specialty--

87
00:04:57,314 --> 00:04:59,539
我來此不是尋找法律意見的 小姐
I'm not here for legal advice, Miss--

88
00:04:59,614 --> 00:05:01,074
-博士 -博士 抱歉
- Doctor. - Doctor, pardon.

89
00:05:01,193 --> 00:05:02,461
現在你已看了新聞
Now you've watched the news,

90
00:05:02,491 --> 00:05:03,656
民眾都在抗議
national focus was on the protests,

91
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,322
這已把州長逼到了絕境
it's got the Governor backed into a corner.

92
00:05:05,364 --> 00:05:07,032
現在如果該判處繼續執行下去
Now if this execution goes forward,

93
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:08,859
按我們的時刻表 不摻雜官方評論
our schedule, without an official review,

94
00:05:09,062 --> 00:05:12,289
州長 將不會有新一輪執政的機會
the Governor won't stand a chance of serving another term.

95
00:05:13,168 --> 00:05:15,328
我只是想讓你跟他談談 好嗎
I just want you to talk to him, hmm?

96
00:05:15,585 --> 00:05:17,712
給他專業的意見
Give him your professional opinion.

97
00:05:17,816 --> 00:05:20,375
就當是盡你的公民義務了
Consider it your civic duty.

98
00:05:21,398 --> 00:05:24,341
或許 僅僅是或許 你將拯救一條生命
Maybe, just maybe, you'll save a life.

99
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:28,809
我的名片和電話號碼在那裏面
My card and my number's in there.

100
00:05:36,648 --> 00:05:39,610
嘿 快點動起來 格裏姆巴
Hey, quit monkeying around, Marimba.

101
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,358
或許是你該停止到處指揮了 利奧
Well maybe if you stopped lion around, Leo.

102
00:05:42,407 --> 00:05:45,937
起床啦 懶漢 探險時間到
Get up, lazy bones, it's time for adventuring.

103
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:51,619
媽咪
Mommy!

104
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,287
嗨 寶貝閨女
Hi, baby girl.

105
00:05:53,524 --> 00:05:55,247
你不該躺在床上
Shouldn't you be in bed?

106
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:59,084
外婆說 睡覺前我可以再看一個電視節目
Grandma said I could watch one more show on TV before bed.

107
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:01,086
她是說了 是吧
She did now, huh?

108
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:03,047
是啊 這個節目裏所有的動物
Yep, all the animals on this show

109
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:04,840
在動物園裏住在一起
live together at the zoo.

110
00:06:05,023 --> 00:06:05,815
噢
Aw.

111
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:09,261
我們能去動物園嗎 媽咪
Can we go to the zoo, Mommy?

112
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:13,474
我跟你說吧
Well I tell you what.

113
00:06:13,516 --> 00:06:15,726
你先上樓去刷牙
How about you go upstairs, brush your teeth,

114
00:06:15,768 --> 00:06:17,728
整個星期都跟外婆乖乖的
and you be a good girl for Grandma all week,

115
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,940
然後下個週末我就帶你去 好嗎
and then I will take you next weekend, okay?

116
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:23,150
上樓去刷牙吧 我會給你掖好被子的
Go on up, brush your teeth and I'll tuck you in.

117
00:06:23,192 --> 00:06:25,277
外婆能不能先給我講個故事
Can Grandma read me a story first?

118
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,154
求你啦 求你啦 求求你
Please, please please?

119
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,741
我想 我能應付過來
I think I can manage that.

120
00:06:30,783 --> 00:06:33,786
走吧 外婆 我們走嘍
Come on, Grandma, let's go.

121
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:38,958
-謝謝你媽媽 -沒問題
- Thanks, Mom. - No problem.

122
00:06:42,294 --> 00:06:44,964
哦我在廚灶裏給你留了晚飯
Oh, I left you some dinner by the stove.

123
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,669
謝謝
Thank you.

124
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:48,919
晚安 媽咪 我愛你
Good night, Mommy, I love you.

125
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,380
晚安 我也愛你
Good night, I love you.

126
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:46,579
我以為你三個月前就戒煙了
I thought you quit three months ago.

127
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:50,765
艾麗對你不做晚飯很是煩惱
Ally was bummed that you didn't make dinner.

128
00:07:50,863 --> 00:07:51,780
我知道啊
I know she was.

129
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,987
你懂的 我只是趕不過來
You know, I just couldn't get here.

130
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,848
但是謝謝你今天從學校接她回來
But thank you for picking her up from school today.

131
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,579
那不算什麼
It's no problem.

132
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,693
-過來 -謝謝你
Come here. - Thank you.

133
00:08:06,712 --> 00:08:08,505
-別熬太晚 孩子
Don't stay up too late, kiddo.

134
00:08:08,547 --> 00:08:09,381
不會的
I won't.

135
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:11,740
晚安 媽媽
Good night, Mom.

136
00:08:11,828 --> 00:08:13,913
晚安 甜心
Good night, sweetheart.

137
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,020
本·伍茲
Ben Woods.

138
00:09:05,062 --> 00:09:06,226
嘿 本 我是泰勒博士
Hey Ben, it's Dr. Tyler.

139
00:09:06,293 --> 00:09:07,615
泰勒博士 你好
Dr. Tyler.

140
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:08,966
我加入
I'm in.

141
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,026
我會去做的
I'll do it.

142
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:15,114
但我有幾個條件
I have a few conditions.

143
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:17,324
我們的會面必須是私下的
Our session needs to be private,

144
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:20,369
所以我不想待在一個標準的採訪室裏
so I don't wanna be in a standard interview room.

145
00:09:20,411 --> 00:09:23,372
我們應該在他覺得舒服的某處會面
We should be somewhere where he feels comfortable,

146
00:09:23,414 --> 00:09:25,749
在那裏他得至少能四處活動
where he can at least move around.

147
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,251
我是說 我們不會有任何進展
I mean we're not gonna get anywhere

148
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:29,461
如果我得不到他的信任
if I can't earn his trust.

149
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,488
-女士 -謝謝你
- Ma'am. - Thank you.

150
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:22,783
嘀嗒
Tick tock.

151
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,245
嘀嗒
Tick, tock.

152
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:31,740
你那要幫忙嗎 博士
You need a hand with that, Doc?

153
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:35,898
我更喜歡被稱作泰勒博士或阿曼達
I prefer to be addressed as Dr. Tyler or Amanda.

154
00:12:07,784 --> 00:12:09,430
請坐
Have a seat, please.

155
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,236
為便於記錄 請報上你的名字
State your name for the record.

156
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:21,175
傑克遜·邁克爾·謝伊
ackson Michael Shea.

157
00:12:22,624 --> 00:12:25,655
78011號囚犯
Inmate 78011.

158
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:28,358
這一切都是有意義的 對嗎 博士
There's a point to all this, right Doc?

159
00:12:28,494 --> 00:12:31,205
看著我人生計時沙漏中的沙子
Seeing as how the sand of my hourglass

160
00:12:31,255 --> 00:12:33,603
就快要漏光
has just about run out.

161
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:37,657
我不覺得這對我有多大好處
I don't see this benefiting me very much.

162
00:12:37,988 --> 00:12:39,948
我的計劃是找到
My plan is to get to the root cause

163
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,681
你過度暴力的根本原因
of your excessive violence.

164
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,346
你是說那些稱我為怪物的
You mean the newspaper and magazine stories

165
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:45,149
報紙雜誌吧
calling me a monster.

166
00:12:45,324 --> 00:12:47,326
-我讀過你的檔案了 -然後呢
- I've read your file. - And what?

167
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:49,126
你已經讀了一些文章
You've read some papers.

168
00:12:49,204 --> 00:12:50,745
其中一些認為那個監獄黑客
Some file a prison hack

169
00:12:50,756 --> 00:12:52,424
在給我看了一些墨水斑點後
too stupid to make it on the outside

170
00:12:52,456 --> 00:12:56,460
在監獄外寫我是非常愚蠢的
wrote about me after he showed me some inkblots.

171
00:13:01,185 --> 00:13:02,647
你看了那該死的東西
You read that shit

172
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,126
然後就以為你已攻入了我的大腦
and think you're inside my head?

173
00:13:10,849 --> 00:13:13,769
博士 你對我他媽的一無所知
Doc, you don't know a fucking thing about me.

174
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,145
你說得對 傑克
You're right, Jack.

175
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:17,022
我是特麼的對你一無所知
I don't know a fucking thing about you.

176
00:13:17,368 --> 00:13:18,604
而且如果我瞭解你
And if I did,

177
00:13:18,615 --> 00:13:21,549
就不會來這裏浪費我的時間或者你的
I wouldn't be here wasting my time, or yours.

178
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:25,030
你想讓我離開嗎
Would you like me to leave?

179
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:28,242
嘀 嗒
Tick, tock.

180
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:33,163
嘀 嗒 嘀 嗒
Tick, tock, tick, tick.

181
00:13:34,623 --> 00:13:39,419
像你這樣漂亮的小妞在這裏做什麼
So what's a pretty little thing like you doing here?

182
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:42,172
你抽到那根倒霉的簽了
You draw the short straw?

183
00:13:42,214 --> 00:13:43,799
是有關暴力的 傑克
It's about the violence, Jack.

184
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,218
如果我能準確還原時間 地點 起因
If I can pinpoint the time, the place, the cause,

185
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,681
那或許我至少能幫助停止這惡性循環
then maybe I can at least help stop the cycle.

186
00:13:50,722 --> 00:13:54,893
現在我們有很重要的決定要做 不是嗎
Now we have some very important decisions to make, don't we?

187
00:14:05,141 --> 00:14:08,063
-我們開始 -從我母親的母乳開始
Let's start-- - With my mother's tit milk.

188
00:14:08,344 --> 00:14:10,961
我在嬰兒時期是否得到了足夠的母乳
Did I get enough as an infant

189
00:14:11,071 --> 00:14:13,649
來合適地滋養我在這文明社會的人生呢
to properly nourish me for life in civilized society?

190
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:15,122
你得到了嗎
Did you?

191
00:14:17,004 --> 00:14:17,797
嘀
Tick.

192
00:14:29,922 --> 00:14:32,466
博士 你準備好聽一個故事了嗎
Doc, you ready to hear a story?

193
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:36,624
嘀 嗒
Tick, tock.

194
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:38,975
嘀 嗒
Tick, tock.

195
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,528
嘀 嗒
Tick, tock.

196
00:14:45,524 --> 00:14:48,110
那是1985年的夏天
It was the summer of '85.

197
00:14:48,183 --> 00:14:50,775
我們沒錢 所以我們不得不
We had no money, so we had to

198
00:14:50,837 --> 00:14:53,702
搬進我舅舅邁克的房子
move into my Uncle Mike's single wide.

199
00:14:54,515 --> 00:14:56,934
有時候 當我閉上眼睛
Sometimes, when I close my eyes,

200
00:14:57,454 --> 00:14:59,634
我仍然能聞到那股拖車的霉味
I can still smell that musty trailer.

201
00:14:59,739 --> 00:15:01,720
大熊想要裝作
Bigger bears try to pretend

202
00:15:01,962 --> 00:15:05,964
它們來這附近看望朋友
that they came 'round the corner to look for a friend.

203
00:15:10,563 --> 00:15:14,086
它們是來這附近看望朋友的
That they came 'round the corner to look for a frown.

204
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:15,640
等等
Hold on.

205
00:15:15,786 --> 00:15:19,790
它們想裝作沒人在意的樣子
And they try to pretend that nobody cares.

206
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:24,122
不管你走在線上 還是走在方塊上
Whether you walk on the lines, or on the squares.

207
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,334
你的電話 辛西婭
Phone for you, Cynthia.

208
00:15:28,102 --> 00:15:29,743
謝謝你 邁克
Thanks, Mike.

209
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:32,118
好了 現在 你邁克舅舅
Okay, well, your Uncle Mike's

210
00:15:32,212 --> 00:15:34,876
會幫你讀完 好嗎
gonna help you finish reading, okay book?

211
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,876
晚安 媽咪
Good night, Mommy.

212
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:53,720
嘿 小伙
. Hey buddy.

213
00:15:54,945 --> 00:15:56,780
嘿 邁克舅舅
Hey, hey Uncle Mike.

214
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:02,327
準備好聽你的 生日床頭故事了嗎
Ready for your birthday bedtime story?

215
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,153
人們總是談論上帝
People always talk about God.

216
00:16:28,398 --> 00:16:29,997
那當我舅舅在半夜
Where was God when my Uncle

217
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,665
偷偷溜進我的臥室
was sneaking into my bedroom late at night,

218
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:35,220
給我講床前故事是 上帝去哪裏了
telling me bedroom stories,

219
00:16:35,574 --> 00:16:37,242
我不想聽
I didn't wanna hear.

220
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:51,820
一切都會好起來的 孩子
Everything is gonna be okay, my son.

221
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:54,318
你現在是在上帝的面前
You are in the presence of the Lord now.

222
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:57,677
告訴我發生了什麼
Tell me what happened.

223
00:17:15,149 --> 00:17:17,651
你母親是什麼反應
How did your mother react to the news?

224
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,122
並非你想的那樣
Not the way you'd think.

225
00:17:20,202 --> 00:17:21,620
謝伊太太
Mrs. Shea, I'm,

226
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:25,263
真希望我是 因為別的原因而出現的
I really wish I were here under different circumstances,

227
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,438
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

228
00:17:27,983 --> 00:17:31,153
這是關於你弟弟和你兒子的
It involves your brother and your son.

229
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:34,038
發生了什麼
Well what is it?

230
00:17:34,271 --> 00:17:38,234
你兒子最近是不是行為很反常
Has, has your son been acting different lately?

231
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,444
他最近有沒有什麼奇怪的行為
Anything strange about his behavior?

232
00:17:41,573 --> 00:17:44,159
我 我兒子是個好孩子
My, my. my son is a good boy.

233
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:48,043
是的
Yes he is.

234
00:17:49,763 --> 00:17:52,721
知道該如何告訴你這件事 那我就直說吧
I don't know how to say this, so I'll just say it.

235
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:54,846
我們認為你的弟弟
We believe that your brother

236
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:57,229
涉嫌猥褻你兒子
has been inappropriately touching your son.

237
00:17:59,763 --> 00:18:03,638
猥褻我兒子
Inappropriately touching my son?

238
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:08,028
你弟弟一直在猥褻你的孩子 謝伊太太
Your brother's been molesting your son, Mrs. Shea.

239
00:18:09,168 --> 00:18:10,711
這不可能
That is not true.

240
00:18:12,752 --> 00:18:13,753
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

241
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:16,731
我不信
That is not true.

242
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:19,105
我不知道你從哪聽說的
I don't know where you got that, but,

243
00:18:19,577 --> 00:18:20,911
但這不是事實
that ain't true.

244
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:24,172
謝伊太太 是你兒子告訴我的
Mrs. Shea, your son told me.

245
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,868
對不起
I'm sorry.

246
00:18:34,422 --> 00:18:36,492
這說不通
That don't make no sense.

247
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,320
這並不是真的
That don't make no sense.

248
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:42,489
這是 這是個謊言
That's a, that's a lie.

249
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,895
這絕對不是真的
That is a goddamn lie.

250
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,078
你在造謠
You're making up stories.

251
00:18:48,196 --> 00:18:51,700
然後你帶著你的慌話 和你的假故事來到
And you come in here with your lies and your stories.

252
00:18:51,937 --> 00:18:53,439
現在你可以離開了
You need to go.

253
00:18:53,457 --> 00:18:55,208
趕快離開我的房子
You need to get the hell outta here.

254
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,445
趕緊走
You need to get the hell outta my house.

255
00:18:57,926 --> 00:18:59,785
滾出我的房子
I said get the hell outta my house.

256
00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:00,907
走 趕緊離開這
Get out, get outta here.

257
00:19:00,949 --> 00:19:02,949
這都是你編造的
And your lies, and your stories.

258
00:19:02,988 --> 00:19:04,613
我不知道你在說些什麼
I don't know what you're talking about.

259
00:19:04,715 --> 00:19:06,996
你到底對我的孩子做了什麼
What the hell did you do to my boy?

260
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:08,803
我是受害者
I was the victim.

261
00:19:08,876 --> 00:19:10,628
但我也可能是犯罪者
But I may as well have been the perpetrator

262
00:19:10,787 --> 00:19:12,872
以她的反應來看
from the way she reacted.

263
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,534
我說了滾出去
I said to get outta my house.

264
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:20,468
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

265
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,572
願上帝與你同在
May God be with you.

266
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,653
這是我家
This is my house!

267
00:19:23,711 --> 00:19:25,072
是我家
It's my house!

268
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:29,142
什麼你要到這裏 對我說這樣的事
Come in here, saying things like that to me.

269
00:19:48,681 --> 00:19:50,767
不久以後辛西婭·謝伊
Cynthia Shea drank herself to death

270
00:19:50,832 --> 00:19:52,334
醺酒致死
pretty soon after.

271
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,403
也許是他殺
Killed, maybe.

272
00:20:00,812 --> 00:20:02,314
你覺得呢
What do you think?

273
00:20:02,693 --> 00:20:06,363
我從小注定是個罪犯 還是
Destined from a tender age to be a criminal, or.

274
00:20:06,858 --> 00:20:08,401
目前來看
Well it's too soon in the process

275
00:20:08,412 --> 00:20:10,039
下結論還為時過早
for me to form an opinion on that.

276
00:20:10,072 --> 00:20:12,366
你的項目到底是什麼
What exactly is your process?

277
00:20:12,729 --> 00:20:14,929
我知道你對病理標誌制度很瞭解
I know that you're familiar with the flag system.

278
00:20:15,056 --> 00:20:17,266
所以我在尋找顯現出的信號
So I am looking for signs that stand out.

279
00:20:17,363 --> 00:20:19,407
並盡早識別出危險標誌
And recognizing the red flags early enough

280
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:22,468
這樣就可以把暴力扼殺在搖籃裏
so that the violence can be stopped.

281
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,662
所以 現在讓我們談談你的舅舅
So, let's talk about your uncle.

282
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,873
在17歲以前我一直和他住在一起
I lived with him until about the time I was 17.

283
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:51,664
當我長大以後 他就把注意力轉移到
After I got too old, Uncle Mike turned his attentions

284
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:55,097
他女朋友的孩子身上去了
to the kid of the girl he'd been seeing.

285
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,978
那個女人並未察覺
She didn't suspect a damn thing.

286
00:21:00,118 --> 00:21:03,330
看到他在那個小男孩身後追逐玩耍
Seeing him chase after that little boy,

287
00:21:04,437 --> 00:21:06,356
我的思維突然中斷
something just snapped.

288
00:21:29,611 --> 00:21:31,947
不 不要過來 求你了
No no, please, God.

289
00:21:41,115 --> 00:21:43,919
我得到了啟發和自由
I felt illuminated and free.

290
00:21:45,288 --> 00:21:46,646
自由
Free?

291
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:48,701
是的 這是我人生中第一次
Well it was the first time in my life

292
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,591
掌握了那些一直引導我的東西
I was ever in control of the events that guided me.

293
00:21:52,537 --> 00:21:55,306
沒有比這更自由的了
Nothing's more freeing than that.

294
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:57,554
你明明就可以阻止他
You know you could've stopped him

295
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:00,140
而非把他打成重傷住進醫院
without putting him in the hospital.

296
00:22:01,328 --> 00:22:03,748
但你選擇了憤怒
You chose to fly into a rage.

297
00:22:04,766 --> 00:22:06,768
你還沒明白嗎 醫生
Don't you get it, Doc?

298
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:10,480
我們都是被關在籠子裏的動物
We're all just caged animals.

299
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,208
有著動物一樣的天性
With animal instincts.

300
00:22:21,283 --> 00:22:24,828
時間到了 泰勒醫生
Time's up, Dr. Tyler.

301
00:22:50,022 --> 00:22:52,188
來自韋科市和其他城市的消防員稱
Firefighters from Waco and other cities

302
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,858
由於乾燥天氣和風況
report that due to dry weather and wind conditions,

303
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,050
火災仍是一個巨大的威脅
the fire is still very much an active threat

304
00:22:57,101 --> 00:22:58,361
對於當地群眾來說
to local communities,

305
00:22:58,403 --> 00:23:01,323
要時刻準備好緊急疏散
and that evacuation orders will remain in place.

306
00:23:01,655 --> 00:23:05,085
現今15%的火災已得到有效遏制
The fire is currently reported to be 15% contained.

307
00:23:05,138 --> 00:23:06,848
敬請期待 更多消息

308
00:23:06,953 --> 00:23:09,632
將會後續報道

309
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:11,364
親愛的 我很想你
God, I miss you.

310
00:23:11,405 --> 00:23:12,626
嚴肅法紀
Looking at law and order,

311
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:15,128
對德克薩斯州的犯人傑克遜·謝伊的處決
the impending execution of Texas inmate Jackson Shea

312
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,589
明確地表明了在德克薩斯州
shines a harsh light on capital punishment

313
00:23:17,631 --> 00:23:19,444
法律與秩序在政府處罰的作用
in the Lone Star State.

314
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:22,202
由於公眾輿論的兩面性
Due to vocal public opinion on both sides of the issue,

315
00:23:22,351 --> 00:23:24,974
州長宣佈對於是否處決謝伊先生
the Governor has announced a final review of the possibility

316
00:23:25,023 --> 00:23:27,609
即將進行最後的審判
for a stay of execution in Mr. Shea's case

317
00:23:27,682 --> 00:23:29,882
基於阿曼達·泰勒醫生的權威
under the authority of Dr. Amanda Tyler,

318
00:23:29,983 --> 00:23:31,936
一位著名的犯罪心理學家
a noted criminal psychologist.

319
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:34,105
州長公佈了泰勒醫生的發現
The Governor has stated that Dr. Tyler's findings

320
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:35,741
這些發現將會成為
will likely be a key factor

321
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:38,335
決定德州法制部門如何判決
in determining what action

322
00:23:38,624 --> 00:23:40,869
的關鍵因素
the Texas Department of Criminal Justice will take.

323
00:23:43,432 --> 00:23:45,726
準備好了嗎 傑克
You ready to start, Jack?

324
00:23:47,077 --> 00:23:49,084
法官讓我自己選擇
The judge gave me a choice.

325
00:23:49,185 --> 00:23:52,756
是去軍事學校還是少教所
Either go to military school, or go to juvie.

326
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,934
我輕鬆完成了基礎訓練
I breeze through basic training,

327
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:58,074
被狙擊手學校選中 因為我視力良好
get selected for sniper school because I have 20/10 vision,

328
00:23:58,171 --> 00:24:00,173
並且出色完成射擊
and I aced marksmanship.

329
00:24:01,084 --> 00:24:02,686
但是你的檔案上說你其實
Well your file says that you actually

330
00:24:02,748 --> 00:24:04,647
被軍事學校開除了
got kicked out of military school.

331
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:07,639
給了你18個月的假釋
That resulted in parole left 18 months.

332
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:11,993
我們的行為都是有後果的 傑克
There's consequences for our actions, Jack.

333
00:24:16,272 --> 00:24:17,553
行動
Action.

334
00:24:18,692 --> 00:24:19,904
後果
Reaction.

335
00:24:20,581 --> 00:24:23,417
行動 你把你的舅舅打進了醫院

336
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,857
後果 你被監禁18個月

337
00:24:25,902 --> 00:24:27,779
18個月 服役12個月
18 months, served 12.

338
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:29,661
所以這代表著什麼
So this is, what?

339
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:32,330
制度的失敗
An example of the system failing?

340
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:33,832
你認為你凌駕於法律之上
You think you're above the law?

341
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:36,626
你欺騙過保險公司嗎 醫生
You ever cheat the insurance companies, Doc?

342
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:38,263
給一位病人開了現金賬單
Bill a patient for cash and put in a claim for it.

343
00:24:38,287 --> 00:24:40,108
同時也開出醫療保險賬單
Us in the know call t

344
00:24:40,296 --> 00:24:44,175
我們都知道這叫雙倍計費
hat double back billing.

345
00:24:44,217 --> 00:24:45,301
第一道防線
First line of defense

346
00:24:45,343 --> 00:24:46,845
抵抗千年蟲
against the Y2K buzz,

347
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:48,555
檢查了每個計算機確保
checking each machine to make sure

348
00:24:48,596 --> 00:24:51,641
它在2000年能正常工作
it works properly in the year 2000.

349
00:24:51,683 --> 00:24:53,881
米婭 能給我來點猛的嗎
Mia, could you give us two fingers of the good stuff?

350
00:24:53,914 --> 00:24:54,662
好的 馬蒂
Yes, Marty.

351
00:24:54,689 --> 00:24:56,357
我在監獄裏認識了馬蒂
I met Marty in prison.

352
00:24:56,508 --> 00:24:59,969
他在圈內很有名
Let's just say he was someone in the know.

353
00:24:59,995 --> 00:25:02,539
我出獄後 他給了我一份工作
Once I got out, he offered me a job,

354
00:25:02,652 --> 00:25:07,031
面對現實吧 誰還會雇一個囚犯呢
'cause let's face it, who else is gonna hire a con?

355
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:08,742
聽我說 孩子
Listen to me, kid.

356
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:14,078
我說的是 醫生 律師 牙醫
I'm talking about doctors, lawyers, dentists.

357
00:25:14,205 --> 00:25:18,741
他們擁有大量現金用來逃稅
Large amounts of cash that don't get reported to the IRS.

358
00:25:18,897 --> 00:25:20,692
所以當這些錢丟了的時候
Won't be reported to the cops

359
00:25:20,711 --> 00:25:22,015
他們也不會報警
if it comes up missing.

360
00:25:22,046 --> 00:25:25,425
他們把錢藏在辦公室的衣櫃裏
They hide their money in a coat closet in their office,

361
00:25:25,467 --> 00:25:27,051
或是床底的鞋盒裏
or in a shoe box under the bed.

362
00:25:27,093 --> 00:25:28,219
曾有一位律師
There was this one lawyer,

363
00:25:28,389 --> 00:25:31,055
他竟然在咖啡罐裏藏了兩萬五千美元
he hid 25,000 fucking dollars in a coffee can

364
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:33,808
然後他把咖啡罐藏在了微波爐裏
that he stuck in a microwave.

365
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,935
這才是關鍵 對吧
There's a point somewhere here, right?

366
00:25:35,977 --> 00:25:37,234
對的 是關鍵
Yeah, this is the point.

367
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:39,501
我的那個白癡保釋官
That dickhead parole officer I have?

368
00:25:39,725 --> 00:25:43,260
他給我一份清理辦公室的夜間工作
He got me a night job cleaning office buildings.

369
00:25:44,277 --> 00:25:45,737
你好
HEY

370
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,601
這個夥計 他是新來的
This guy, he's gotta replace

371
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:48,823
二樓清潔工
the ShopVac on the second floor.

372
00:25:48,865 --> 00:25:50,003
我關心這個嗎
The hell I care for?

373
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,145
簽個名就可以了
Just sign the damn board.

374
00:26:08,343 --> 00:26:11,262
這裏面有個婦科專家
Now in one of these buildings is a gynecologist,

375
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:13,681
他會給那些付現金的女人打折
who gives a discount to women who pay cash,

376
00:26:13,723 --> 00:26:17,227
然後他給她們的保險公司開賬單
and then he bills their insurance company.

377
00:26:31,783 --> 00:26:33,056
找到了
There it is.

378
00:26:41,613 --> 00:26:43,472
他的保險箱在櫃子裏
He's got a safe in his closet

379
00:26:43,511 --> 00:26:45,527
而且保險箱還有縫隙
that is bursting out the fucking seams.

380
00:26:45,672 --> 00:26:47,503
我們會得到多少錢
How much money are we talking about?

381
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,592
誰也不知道 除非我們打開了它
We won't know 'til we open it.

382
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,664
這個醫生肯定是個白癡
This doctor must be some kinda idiot.

383
00:26:51,752 --> 00:26:52,962
他買的鑲嵌式保險櫃
He buys himself a wall safe,

384
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:55,056
卻把它放衣櫃裏了
but he doesn't put it in a wall.

385
00:26:55,067 --> 00:26:56,121
錘子呢
You got the hammer, kid?

386
00:26:56,191 --> 00:26:59,128
快拿出錘子來 快點
What're you doing, get the chisel, come on, man, come on.

387
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:03,493
快
Come on.

388
00:27:04,336 --> 00:27:07,339
就沿著它的邊 很好砸的 快
Now just go down the sides, it's soft there, come on.

389
00:27:14,346 --> 00:27:15,361
太好了
Yes.

390
00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:17,893
我們打開前不知道多少錢 但我告訴你
We won't know until we open it, but I can tell you this.

391
00:27:17,932 --> 00:27:20,123
如果有人覺得很必要
If someone finds it necessary

392
00:27:20,164 --> 00:27:22,953
在他們的辦公室裏藏一個無線保險箱
to hide an unwired safe in their office,

393
00:27:23,132 --> 00:27:26,796
一般來說 他都有一個很恰當的理由
generally speaking, it's for a very good reason.

394
00:27:29,966 --> 00:27:30,758
天啊
Damn.

395
00:27:32,135 --> 00:27:35,013
就像在擠奶
Just like milking a tit, kid.

396
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:37,014
快 把這些裝好後就溜
Come on, pack it up, get the fuck outta here

397
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:39,061
早飯時在我那接頭
and meet me back at my place for breakfast.

398
00:27:50,153 --> 00:27:51,571
你聽我的
You listen to me.

399
00:27:51,613 --> 00:27:53,781
按我說的做 然後我們兩個
You do what I say, and both of us

400
00:27:53,823 --> 00:27:56,159
都可以偷溜掉
could make our Mike bend it.

401
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,767
等一下
. Hey

402
00:28:02,582 --> 00:28:04,628
你忘了簽名
You forgot to sign out.

403
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:06,544
抱歉
Sorry.

404
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:21,345
我小時候非常窮 但是現在
I grew up poor, but there I was,

405
00:28:21,688 --> 00:28:25,355
我眼前的的錢 比我母親一年的工資都高
staring at more money than my Mama made in a year.

406
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:32,140
一萬六千四百美元
' 65400

407
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:37,215
拿吧 你拿一半
Go ahead, take your half.

408
00:28:38,451 --> 00:28:39,708
一半
Half?

409
00:28:40,078 --> 00:28:42,080
當然了 我們可是合作夥伴
Yeah, we're partners.

410
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:42,944
分你一半
Take half,

411
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:45,421
合作夥伴就是這樣分的 一人一半
that's what partners do, right down the middle.

412
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:50,088
快 拿著它
Come on, take it, take it, take it.

413
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:52,966
只要你遵循規則 我們就會成為富豪
So long as you follow the rules, we're golden.

414
00:28:53,007 --> 00:28:54,342
第一天規則
Number one rule.

415
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,012
你要保持一副完全無害的樣子
You gotta stay innocuous.

416
00:28:58,054 --> 00:28:59,847
不要讓他們注意到你
Don't let them see you coming.

417
00:28:59,889 --> 00:29:02,642
你知道 警察在調查搶劫案時
You know the cops in robbery,

418
00:29:02,684 --> 00:29:03,723
他們通常都會找那些
they're looking for the asshole

419
00:29:03,738 --> 00:29:04,686
走在大街上
who's walking down the street

420
00:29:04,727 --> 00:29:05,789
在搶劫案發生後
with a shiny new

421
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,074
還帶著嶄新的勞力士手錶的蠢貨
Rolex the day after a big heist.

422
00:29:08,106 --> 00:29:10,692
一旦你被他們盯上 那你就完了
And once you're pegged, you're pegged.

423
00:29:10,703 --> 00:29:12,404
我的意思是 夥計 你可以給自己
I mean, kid you could buy yourself

424
00:29:12,436 --> 00:29:14,278
時不時的買雙新鞋
a new pair of shoes once in a while,

425
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,615
但你穿著手工西裝去百老匯街上晃悠
but you go walking down Broadway in a silk Italian suit?

426
00:29:17,657 --> 00:29:21,869
那你佘生就只能在號子裏度過了
You'll be in a lineup for the rest of your life.

427
00:29:21,911 --> 00:29:24,497
我們是一條繩上的螞蚱 對嗎
We on the same train here, kid?

428
00:29:25,456 --> 00:29:27,041
是的
Yeah.

429
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:30,086
而且這輛車早已離站
I'd say that train left the station.

430
00:29:34,757 --> 00:29:36,467
你不應該再喝咖啡了
You gotta stop drinking coffee.

431
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:37,593
打開它
Open that up.

432
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:40,888
它會造成胃穿孔
It's gonna put a hole in your stomach.

433
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,306
咖啡對你最有害了
It's the worst thing for you, coffee.

434
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:44,183
對你的神經也不好
It's bad for your nerves.

435
00:29:44,225 --> 00:29:45,727
喝酒比喝咖啡好一點兒
This'll make it a little better,

436
00:29:45,768 --> 00:29:48,062
但還是不喝的好
but you really should stop that.

437
00:29:48,104 --> 00:29:49,981
我們是朋友 你懂我的意思麼
I'm your friend, you know what I mean?

438
00:29:50,023 --> 00:29:51,774
你的前路一片光明
You got a big future.

439
00:29:53,616 --> 00:29:54,951
為一起犯罪而乾杯
Here's to crime.

440
00:29:55,778 --> 00:29:59,949
誰說犯罪一無所成
Who says crime doesn't pay?

441
00:30:02,243 --> 00:30:03,619
為健康乾杯
Salud.

442
00:30:03,661 --> 00:30:06,372
我是馬丁的徒弟 馬丁是我的導師
I was a student, Marty the teacher.

443
00:30:06,414 --> 00:30:07,874
我們一起犯了三次案之後
After our third job together,

444
00:30:07,915 --> 00:30:10,168
馬蒂開始檢驗我的犯罪技巧
Marty put me to the test.

445
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:12,086
找到我自己獨特的犯罪方式
Find a mark of my own.

446
00:30:12,128 --> 00:30:14,422
所以我去看了些當地的牙醫
So I checked out a few local dentists.

447
00:30:14,464 --> 00:30:15,965
醫生 我沒有醫保卡
Hey Doc, I don't have an insurance card,

448
00:30:16,007 --> 00:30:17,717
付現金可以打折麼
do you give discounts for cash?

449
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:18,885
恐怕不行
'Fraid not.

450
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:21,846
只能是醫保卡
Insurance and cards only.

451
00:30:23,514 --> 00:30:27,977
嘴張大點兒 你好像長了顆蛀牙
Open wide, seems like you've got a bad cavity.

452
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:29,187
到了第三個牙醫的時候
By the third dentist,

453
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:32,482
我的牙齦腫脹的好像
my gums were so swollen that my teeth felt like

454
00:30:32,523 --> 00:30:34,692
我的牙都要掉下來似的
they were ready to fall out.

455
00:30:34,734 --> 00:30:37,487
但是 我的牙確實是乾淨的很了
But, I had the cleanest mouth in the city.

456
00:30:37,856 --> 00:30:40,645
我都沒想到你這麼笨
I can't believe you'd be so stupid.

457
00:30:40,863 --> 00:30:44,994
你一天洗了幾次牙
How many times can you get your teeth cleaned in one day?

458
00:30:45,036 --> 00:30:46,037
我們一起找個辦法
Here we are.

459
00:30:47,955 --> 00:30:48,790
牙醫
Dentists.

460
00:30:56,881 --> 00:30:57,998
下午好
Good afternoon,

461
00:30:58,046 --> 00:30:59,287
感謝致電陽光牙科醫院
thank you for calling Sunshine Dental.

462
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,092
你好 請問你們提供
Hello, do you offer

464
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:04,514
哦 先生 我們提供
Oh, yes sir, we do.

00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:07,100
你們提供現金優惠啊
You do offer discounts for cash.

467
00:31:07,141 --> 00:31:08,351
對的 我們提供
Too right, we do.

468
00:31:08,392 --> 00:31:09,602
很好
Well that's fantastic.

469
00:31:09,644 --> 00:31:10,812
非常感謝
Thank you very much.

470
00:31:10,853 --> 00:31:11,604
您願意先預約
Well would you care to make an

471
00:31:14,941 --> 00:31:18,111
孩子 你今兒吸取了什麼教訓
What's the moral of your story, kid?

472
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:23,366
你用手指一行行劃過這些黃頁
Let your fingers do the walking through the Yellow Pages.

473
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:27,411
這是什麼
What's this?

474
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:29,956
聖誕禮物
That is a Christmas present.

475
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:35,169
所以這就是那種
So it's one of those,

476
00:31:35,211 --> 00:31:38,005
天上掉餡餅的事
too good to be true type of deals.

477
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:39,841
打開保險櫃之前
We don't know what's in the fucking safe

478
00:31:39,882 --> 00:31:41,092
我們都不知道裏面有什麼
until we open it, right?

479
00:31:41,134 --> 00:31:42,009
起來吧
Come on.

480
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:43,335
我不能坐在這兒
I can't sit here.

481
00:31:43,386 --> 00:31:44,320
我討厭這個沙發
I hate that couch,

482
00:31:44,331 --> 00:31:46,065
有一回我看見裏面有隻老鼠
you know I found a rat in there once.

483
00:31:46,097 --> 00:31:48,182
我坐之前你怎麼不說
Why didn't you tell me that before I sat on it?

484
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:52,395
至少在你睡在上面之前
Before you slept on it.

485
00:31:57,984 --> 00:32:00,945
利奧·弗蘭克 一個律師
Leo Frank, attorney at law.

486
00:32:00,987 --> 00:32:03,432
馬丁的一個老朋友提供的消息
The tip game from an old friend of Martin's

487
00:32:03,494 --> 00:32:06,367
這個朋友還在服刑 出來以後需要一筆錢
who was still doing time and needed a stake when he got out.

488
00:32:06,409 --> 00:32:09,996
馬丁答應給他兩成
Martin agreed to put away 20% for him.

489
00:32:18,296 --> 00:32:19,630
時機正好
Right on time.

490
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,886
好了 我們從樓那邊的
Alright, we gain access through the maintenance door

491
00:32:24,927 --> 00:32:26,721
維修門過去
on the side of the building.

492
00:32:26,762 --> 00:32:27,597
開始行動
Let's go.

493
00:32:41,235 --> 00:32:43,905
-保險櫃在哪兒 -在那兒吧檯後面
- Where's the safe? - There it is, behind the bar.

494
00:32:43,946 --> 00:32:45,448
正如他所說
Just like he said.

495
00:32:57,043 --> 00:32:58,628
既然你不想竊聽
Now why would you go through all the trouble

496
00:32:58,669 --> 00:33:01,088
為什麼在這個保險櫃上這麼折騰
with a safe like that if you're not gonna wire it?

497
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:06,385
你沒法竊聽不存在的東西
You don't hardwire something that doesn't exist.

498
00:33:06,427 --> 00:33:09,055
老前輩你確定這麼干沒問題麼
You sure about this, old man?

499
00:33:10,931 --> 00:33:12,634
-該死 -怎麼了
- Shit. - What?

500
00:33:13,976 --> 00:33:16,229
-電池沒電了 -你在逗我麼
- Battery's dead. - Are you kidding me?

501
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,855
你帶備用電池了沒
Do you have any extras?

502
00:33:17,897 --> 00:33:20,316
手電筒裏倒是有一個 能行麼
There's one in the flashlights, will those work?

503
00:33:20,358 --> 00:33:22,109
不行 這個要用3A型號的
No, this takes AAA.

504
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:39,085
我好像找到了點兒什麼
Think I found something.

505
00:33:39,126 --> 00:33:40,544
快把那個拿開 真噁心
Get out of here with that, it's disgusting.

506
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:41,796
拿好了
Hold on.

507
00:33:41,837 --> 00:33:43,130
你不知道這個以前在哪兒
You don't know where that's been.

508
00:33:43,172 --> 00:33:45,174
你不要臉皮了麼
Have you no decency?

509
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,385
去門口望望風
Just watch the door.

510
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:48,886
電池裝好了馬蒂
Wrap it up, Marty.

511
00:33:48,928 --> 00:33:50,763
好了
Okay, okay, alright.

512
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,275
好
Yes.

513
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,321
你知道證據開示
Did you know that motion for discovery

514
00:34:07,363 --> 00:34:08,906
是指原告和被告
means the prosecutor and the defendant

515
00:34:08,948 --> 00:34:10,908
必須交換與案件相關的
must exchange all evidence and information

516
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,618
所有證據和信息麼
pertinent to a case?

517
00:34:24,964 --> 00:34:28,509
66萬美元先減去兩成再對半分
$660,000, divided by two, minus 20%,

518
00:34:29,593 --> 00:34:32,346
今晚收穫頗豐 小伙子
is a great night's work, man.

519
00:34:32,388 --> 00:34:33,180
該死
Fuck.

520
00:34:35,391 --> 00:34:36,225
怎麼了
What?

521
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,144
怎麼了
What?

522
00:34:47,528 --> 00:34:49,447
我也不知道 馬蒂 只是
I don't know, Marty, it's just.

523
00:34:49,488 --> 00:34:53,242
我知道當天上掉餡餅的時候
I know when something is too good to be true.

524
00:34:54,702 --> 00:34:56,787
你什麼意思
What's your point?

525
00:34:56,829 --> 00:34:59,832
我的意思是沒有那麼多裝滿了
My point is that there's not that many safes lying around

526
00:34:59,874 --> 00:35:01,167
無用的現金的保險櫃
with this kinda cash in it

527
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:02,793
等著你去偷
that aren't for something special.

528
00:35:02,835 --> 00:35:04,211
你怎麼了
What's the matter with you?

529
00:35:04,253 --> 00:35:05,588
你瘋了麼 拜託
Are you mental? Come on.

530
00:35:05,629 --> 00:35:06,714
我是認真的
I'm serious.

531
00:35:06,756 --> 00:35:08,453
馬蒂如果你想要的話
Marty, I will take the money back for you,

532
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,384
我會把和今晚相同的錢帶回來給你
tonight, if you want.

533
00:35:10,664 --> 00:35:13,471
孩子 你在說些什麼
Kid, what're you talking about?

534
00:35:13,512 --> 00:35:14,889
我們不能把錢放回去
We can't put it back.

535
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:17,725
我們拿上錢 在沙灘上買個公寓
We take the money, and buy a condo on the beach somewhere,

536
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:19,727
和遲暮的太太們一起玩推圓盤遊戲
play shuffleboard with the old ladies.

537
00:35:19,769 --> 00:35:21,437
只是 我們要離開這個小鎮
Just, get outta town.

538
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:23,647
好 我答應你
Okay, okay, I'll make you a deal.

539
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:27,234
給我一周時間讓我收收尾
Give me one week to tie up some loose ends.

540
00:35:27,276 --> 00:35:28,903
然後我去德克薩斯找這個朋友
And then I've got this friend in Texas,

541
00:35:28,944 --> 00:35:30,863
我本想介紹你們認識
I was gonna introduce you to him.

542
00:35:30,905 --> 00:35:33,991
但是我們會拿上錢 會離開這兒
But we'll take the money, we'll leave town.

543
00:35:34,033 --> 00:35:35,409
只要一周
One week.

544
00:35:35,451 --> 00:35:36,702
這是我唯一的要求
It's all I ask.

545
00:35:38,287 --> 00:35:39,080
行麼
Okay?

-貝爾蒙特先生 -對
Mr. Belmont? - Yeah.

548
00:36:04,355 --> 00:36:08,984
這是威廉懷爾德隊長搶劫部門的
This is Captain William Wilder, robbery division.

549
00:36:09,026 --> 00:36:10,986
事實是這樣的 米基
The point is this, Micky?

550
00:36:11,028 --> 00:36:14,490
我都雇了很多警察了 不需要再來一個
I got plenty of cops on payroll, I don't need another one.

551
00:36:14,532 --> 00:36:18,702
隊長給你帶來了一個商業機密
The captain's got a business proposal for you.

552
00:36:22,665 --> 00:36:24,333
聽著 貝爾蒙特先生
Look, Mr. Belmont.

我妻子需要一個全新的廚房
My wife wants an entirely new kitchen.

554
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:31,966
我兒子需要在地下室裏打造一個娛樂室
My sons want an entertainment room in the basement.

555
00:36:32,007 --> 00:36:34,048
我需要一個獨立的浴室
And I want my own bathroom

556
00:36:34,088 --> 00:36:35,163
這樣我就不用看
so I don't have to look

557
00:36:35,174 --> 00:36:37,017
我妻子的那些該死的壁掛了
at my wife's shit hanging on the shower.

558
00:36:37,096 --> 00:36:40,933
我看起來像一個室內裝修設計師麼
Do I look like an interior decorator to you?

559
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:44,478
並不
No.

560
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,230
那我為什麼要聽你說你妻子
Then why do I give a fuck about your wife's shit

561
00:36:46,272 --> 00:36:48,274
在浴室裏放的該死的壁掛

563
00:36:51,277 --> 00:36:52,945
鮑勃聽他說完

00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:04,915
你得為我想要的東西買單 貝爾蒙特先生
You gonna pay for these things I want, Mr. Belmont.

565
00:37:04,957 --> 00:37:06,667
作為是誰偷了你保險櫃的情報來交換
Plus a little bonus in exchange

566
00:37:06,709 --> 00:37:09,462
還得給我一筆錢
for the man who robbed your safe.

567
00:37:13,674 --> 00:37:17,470
你還是小心點兒的好 警隊先生
You oughtta be very careful, Mr. Police Captain,

568
00:37:17,511 --> 00:37:21,515
否則某天你就會消失在你的警區
or you might find yourself missing in your own precinct.

569
00:37:21,557 --> 00:37:22,975
-羅伯特 -嗯
- Robert. - Yeah.

570
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:30,858
那個人是個手段老道的慣偷
The man is an old school thief.

571
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,736
膽子很大

572
00:37:35,029 --> 00:37:36,447
常常入室行竊

573
00:37:38,073 --> 00:37:40,408
你的保險櫃被偷以後利奧就來找我了
Leo comes to me after your safe was robbed

574
00:37:40,471 --> 00:37:42,565
我私下裏打聽了一下
and I do a little quiet poking around.

575
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,414
線人告訴我
My contacts tell me that he's living

576
00:37:45,456 --> 00:37:48,459
他住在一個百貨公司的地下室裏
in a basement of a department store.

577
00:37:52,338 --> 00:37:55,132
你想知道地址麼
You wanna know the address?

578
00:38:19,406 --> 00:38:22,868
你妻子喜歡什麼樣的廚房
What kinda kitchen does your wife like?

579
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,034
難纏的傢伙 你把我的錢弄哪兒去了
Where's my money, tough guy?

580
00:39:04,076 --> 00:39:05,327
我不知道
I don't know.

581
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:07,376
我發誓我真的不知道
I swear I don't know.

582
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,233
天啊
Jesus.

583
00:39:25,688 --> 00:39:27,231
搜查這地方
Search the place.

584
00:39:53,292 --> 00:39:56,045
你是個頑固的狗娘養
You're a stubborn son of a bitch.

585
00:41:12,705 --> 00:41:15,416
這是把你推進地獄的催化劑
The catalyst that launched you into hell.

586
00:41:15,457 --> 00:41:17,543
用地獄來形容未免太過了
Hell might be a bit extreme.

587
00:41:18,068 --> 00:41:20,671
那你覺得應該是什麼
Well what would you call it?

588
00:41:20,713 --> 00:41:22,881
-煉獄 -預言
Purgatory? - Anticipation.

589
00:41:23,966 --> 00:41:25,884
你知道 那種在陷入
You know, that intense feeling you get

590
00:41:25,926 --> 00:41:28,285
明知會改變你人生軌跡的東西之前的
right before you jump into something

591
00:41:28,339 --> 00:41:30,891
強烈的感覺
that you know will change your life forever.

592
00:41:30,973 --> 00:41:34,727
我覺得煉獄這個詞也不錯
I guess purgatory's as good a word as anyway.

593
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:47,197
雙手放在方向盤上

594

把自己銬在方向盤上

595
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:54,663
向前拉
Pull forward.

596
00:41:57,291 --> 00:42:01,044
你得告訴我是誰殺了馬丁·比格
You're gonna tell me who murdered Martin Bigg.

597
00:42:01,086 --> 00:42:02,546
告訴我那個人的名字
I need a name.

598
00:42:02,588 --> 00:42:03,630
我不能說
I can't.

599
00:42:03,672 --> 00:42:06,175
-告訴我名字 -我不能說他會殺了我
- I need a name. - I can't, he'll kill me.

600
00:42:06,216 --> 00:42:07,217
那你就不怕我嗎
What about me?

601
00:42:07,259 --> 00:42:09,386
你要是不告訴我他的名字
I will kill you right here, right now,

602
00:42:09,428 --> 00:42:12,055
我馬上就地殺了你
unless you give me a fucking name.

603
00:42:12,456 --> 00:42:13,916
羅伯特·貝爾蒙特
Robert Belmont.

604
00:42:15,142 --> 00:42:15,976
放開我
Let go.

605
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,563
他是關鍵人物
He's the key.

606
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:28,572
羅伯特 貝爾蒙特

607
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:32,636
頭號放高利貸者和商人
Big time loan shark and business man.

608
00:42:32,826 --> 00:42:35,329
他不難追蹤
He wasn't hard to track down.

609
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:38,081
我開始兼職司機
I started moonlighting as a chauffeur,

610
00:42:38,123 --> 00:42:40,584
載著這個狗娘養的
driving the son of a bitch.

611
00:42:40,626 --> 00:42:41,794
瞭解他的行程
Learned his routine.

612
00:42:41,835 --> 00:42:45,756
我甚至從他情婦的家裏接過他
I even picked him up from his mistress's place.

613
00:42:45,977 --> 00:42:48,673
我等他喝酒的時候
I always had a drink waiting for him.

614
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:53,055
有一天晚上 我在酒裏偷偷加了點料
And then one night, I slipped in a little something extra.

615
00:43:01,939 --> 00:43:03,690
你醒了
There he is.

616
00:43:03,732 --> 00:43:05,692
早上好 陽光明媚
Morning, sunshine.

617
00:43:05,734 --> 00:43:08,570
我還擔心我加料加多了呢
I was worried I put a little too much in your drink.

618
00:43:08,612 --> 00:43:11,114
放開我 你個慫包
Untie me, you piss ant fuck.

619
00:43:12,032 --> 00:43:14,451
再怎麼粗魯都沒用
There's no need to be rude.

620
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:18,330
好吧
Okay, alright.

621
00:43:20,415 --> 00:43:22,209
你說得沒錯
You proved your point.

622
00:43:28,006 --> 00:43:31,260
放開我 告訴我你想要什麼
Now untie me and tell me what you want.

623
00:43:39,351 --> 00:43:40,185

624
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,523
孩子 你膽量不錯
You got balls, kid.

625
00:43:45,649 --> 00:43:47,985
你想要的我可以給你
I'll give that to you.

626
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:49,778
你知道 你可能就是
You know, you may just be

627
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,698
我一直在找的那種人
the guy that I've been looking for.

628
00:43:55,284 --> 00:43:58,287
那種能把我的業務提升的人
The guy that's gonna take my business to the next level.

629
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:01,665
真是個冷笑話
I fail to see what's so funny.

630
00:44:01,707 --> 00:44:03,667
你被孤零零的綁在椅子上
You're alone, tied to a chair.

631
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:05,794
以你現在的狀況
What about this situation leads you to believe

632
00:44:05,836 --> 00:44:09,548
你怎麼會覺得還能和我討價還價
you're in a position suitable for bargaining?

633
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:12,384
好
. Okay

634
00:44:16,013 --> 00:44:18,015
放了我 你走吧
Untie me, and walk away.

635
00:44:20,601 --> 00:44:24,771
我們就當這事沒發生過
We'll just let this one go.

636
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,695
你還是沒搞清楚狀況 博比
You're not paying attention, Bobby.

637
00:44:31,737 --> 00:44:34,615
你之所以還活著
The only reason you're still alive,

638
00:44:35,949 --> 00:44:38,285
是因為我還沒殺你
is I haven't killed you yet.

639
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:41,955
你想要多少錢
How much?

640
00:44:52,507 --> 00:44:54,426
我會給你喝杯這個
I will give you this.

641
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:56,887
你對威士忌的品味還不賴
You have fine taste in whiskey.

642
00:44:56,929 --> 00:44:58,680
你到底要多少錢
How much?

643
00:45:00,557 --> 00:45:02,351
別動 博比
Stay with me, Bobby, boy.

644
00:45:02,392 --> 00:45:03,477
別動
Stay with me.

645
00:45:08,899 --> 00:45:10,067
一百萬
One million.

646
00:45:14,696 --> 00:45:17,157
你還記得這個吧 對吧
You remember this, don't you?

647
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:18,575
自大狂
You arrogant fuck.

648
00:45:18,617 --> 00:45:20,953
這是我搭檔的
This belonged to my partner.

649
00:45:22,788 --> 00:45:26,208
他不知道那是你的錢
He didn't know the money was yours.

650
00:45:26,249 --> 00:45:29,336
你本可以放過他一次的
You could've, let that one go.

651
00:45:29,378 --> 00:45:32,214
你兄弟就是個混蛋
Your partner was a degenerate fuck, alright?

652
00:45:32,255 --> 00:45:33,507
他從我這偷錢
He stole from me.

653
00:45:33,548 --> 00:45:37,177
我該怎麼做 像個兄弟似地拍拍他嗎
What am I supposed to do, just pat him on the back?

654
00:45:37,219 --> 00:45:38,011
去他媽的
Fuck that.

655
00:45:40,889 --> 00:45:42,557
噢 好吧 對不起
Okay, alright, I'm sorry.

656
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:43,600
200萬
Two million.

657
00:45:44,476 --> 00:45:46,561
你話太多了 鮑勃
You talk too much, Bob.

658
00:45:48,397 --> 00:45:51,149
我對你的錢沒興趣
I'm not interested in your money.

659
00:45:56,113 --> 00:45:57,990
你折磨我的兄弟
You tortured my friend.

660
00:46:01,743 --> 00:46:03,180
你折磨他
You tortured him,

661
00:46:04,133 --> 00:46:06,912
你讓他像被宰的豬一樣流血到死
and let him bleed to death like a pig.

662
00:46:12,629 --> 00:46:14,131
這是替馬蒂做的
This is for Marty.

663
00:46:27,185 --> 00:46:28,687
我只是讓那個雜種知道
I gave that bastard a preview

664
00:46:28,729 --> 00:46:32,232
在地獄等著他的是什麼
of what's waiting for him in hell.

665
00:46:32,274 --> 00:46:34,443
貝爾蒙特只是遭到了報應
Belmont got what he deserved,

666
00:46:34,484 --> 00:46:38,071
但是醫生 我想讓你知道
but I wanna make one thing real clear to you, Doc.

667
00:46:38,113 --> 00:46:40,032
那並不是謀殺
I didn't commit murder.

668
00:46:40,073 --> 00:46:42,159
我是在伸張正義
I performed an execution.

669
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:45,328
-這是有區別的 -胡說八道
There's a difference. Bullshit.

670
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:48,498
根本沒區別你也知道的
I don't believe that, and neither do you.

671
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:51,334
你說得挺多 但是你想表明的是什麼呢
You talk a lot, but what can you really speak for?

672
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:53,086
可以為我辯護嗎
Can you speak for me?

673
00:46:53,128 --> 00:46:55,505
-我想問你個問題 -別廢話了
- I wanna ask you a question. - Tick, tock.

674
00:46:55,547 --> 00:46:59,676
當我被處決的時候 你會在乎我嗎
When it's my time, will you care about me then?

675
00:46:59,718 --> 00:47:02,304
當第一根針慢慢
That moment when the needle, the very first one,

676
00:47:02,345 --> 00:47:05,348
刺入我的身體 我漸漸失去意識的時候
slips into my body and relaxes my nerves.

677
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:07,309
你會看著我嗎
Are you gonna watch me?

678
00:47:08,769 --> 00:47:11,772
會嗎 抑或轉頭看向別處呢
Are you gonna watch me, or are you gonna turn and look away?

679
00:47:11,813 --> 00:47:13,940
第二根針令我無法呼吸的時候
When the second needle freezes my lungs,

680
00:47:13,982 --> 00:47:15,484
你會驚恐地去扒那些
are you gonna scribble scrabble

681
00:47:15,525 --> 00:47:19,154
寫滿計劃的便條薄嗎
in your notepad for future reference?

682
00:47:19,196 --> 00:47:22,407
到第三根針時 我的心臟停止跳動
And when that third needle stops my heart,

683
00:47:22,449 --> 00:47:25,869
隨之他們宣佈我死亡
and they pronounce my body dead,

684
00:47:26,215 --> 00:47:29,218
你是為我的死亡感到悲痛呢
are you gonna anguish over my death?

685
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:32,779
還是會法律伸張了正義
Or are you gonna rejoice

686
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:34,836
而感到欣慰呢
that the law of your land was fulfilled?

687
00:47:37,005 --> 00:47:38,278
都不會
Neither.

688
00:47:40,759 --> 00:47:43,303
你見過死亡的過程嗎 醫生
You ever see anyone die, Doc?

689
00:47:44,763 --> 00:47:48,225
你見到過人們眼中的光
You ever watch as the light fades

690
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:51,186
漸漸黯淡最後熄滅
out of someone's eyes as they just,

691
00:47:52,854 --> 00:47:54,856
飄散得無影無蹤嗎
drift away into nothing?

692
00:47:59,236 --> 00:48:02,280
那不關你的事
It's none of your fucking business.

693
00:48:04,783 --> 00:48:05,909
這不是我的事
It's not about me.

694
00:48:07,661 --> 00:48:09,329
就是你的事
This is about you.

695
00:48:10,747 --> 00:48:14,417
所有的一切都是你的遊戲
This whole game has been about you.

696
00:48:14,459 --> 00:48:18,630
你那狗屁的狂妄態度對我不起用 醫生
Your bullshit cocky attitude isn't gonna work with me, Doc.

697
00:48:22,634 --> 00:48:23,718
跟我沒關係
It's not about me.

698
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,761
我不
I don't,

699
00:48:24,803 --> 00:48:27,097
他媽不在乎跟你有沒有關係
I don't fucking care if it's about you.

700
00:48:27,139 --> 00:48:29,641
去你的那些狗屁問題
Fuck your questions, fuck you.

701
00:48:30,976 --> 00:48:31,810
我不玩了
I'm done.

702
00:48:33,854 --> 00:48:37,482
我不會再陪你玩這狗屁遊戲
I'm not playing your fucking games anymore.

703
00:48:54,082 --> 00:48:57,711
我說結束的時候才是結束
You're done playing games when I tell you.

704
00:48:58,712 --> 00:48:59,546
懂嗎
Got it?

705
00:49:03,341 --> 00:49:06,428
所有證據應該都已經在火災中毀了
Any evidence should have been destroyed in the fire,

706
00:49:06,469 --> 00:49:09,806
所以我覺得是時候離開這了
so I figured it was time to leave the city.

707
00:49:26,865 --> 00:49:28,992
你知道這是誰的地盤嗎
You know who runs this place?

708
00:49:29,034 --> 00:49:31,411
查理羅斯先生
Mr. Charlie Rose.

709
00:49:31,453 --> 00:49:32,954
不用找了
Keep the change.

710
00:49:52,001 --> 00:49:54,033
我在馬蒂的德克薩斯州的旅行書上
I found an address in Marty's

711
00:49:54,088 --> 00:49:55,465
發現了一個地址
Texas travel book.

712
00:50:08,198 --> 00:50:10,075
然後她出現了
And then there she was.

713
00:50:11,493 --> 00:50:16,122
她是我見過最美的女人
She was the most beautiful woman I'd ever laid my eyes on.

714
00:50:16,164 --> 00:50:18,667
-晚上好啊 -嗨 貝利
- Good evening. - Hello, Billy.

715
00:50:19,584 --> 00:50:22,087
我們有位貴賓吧
I believe we have a guest.

716
00:50:22,128 --> 00:50:23,713
就在那
Right over there.

717
00:50:27,133 --> 00:50:29,094
你真是個寶寶
Aren't you a sweetie.

718
00:50:43,525 --> 00:50:45,402
打擾一下 我們見過嗎
I'm sorry, have we met?

719
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:47,195
沒有
Not exactly.

720
00:50:47,237 --> 00:50:48,071
奧利維亞
Olivia.

721
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:51,283
-傑克遜 -謝依我知道的
- Jackson. - Shea, yes.

722
00:50:59,666 --> 00:51:02,294
馬丁比格是我們共同的朋友
Martin Bigg was a mutual friend.

723
00:51:07,424 --> 00:51:09,926
放心我不是警察
Oh don't worry, I'm not a cop.

724
00:51:12,138 --> 00:51:15,598
不過你對貝爾蒙特做出的事 可夠勁兒的
But that was quite a job you did on Belmont.

725
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,517
你怎麼知道就是我幹的
Who says that was me?

726
00:51:18,643 --> 00:51:20,312
我自有方法
I have my sources.

727
00:51:22,105 --> 00:51:25,275
我不喜歡被別人跟著
I don't like being followed.

728
00:51:25,317 --> 00:51:26,151
看出來了
Noted.

729
00:51:32,824 --> 00:51:33,992
和我跳舞吧
Dance with me.

730
00:51:39,497 --> 00:51:43,084
你當不了警察一定是因為你大美了
And you're too pretty to be a cop.

731
00:51:53,762 --> 00:51:55,305
我不認識馬丁
I didn't know Martin.

732
00:51:55,347 --> 00:51:58,099
但我的父親跟他很熟
But my father, very close to him.

733
00:52:00,977 --> 00:52:03,229
你父親是誰
Who's your father?

734
00:52:04,647 --> 00:52:05,857
查理·羅斯
Charlie Rose.

735
00:52:08,693 --> 00:52:09,861
和你一樣
Just like you.

736
00:52:11,446 --> 00:52:13,114
他也是個商人
He's a business man.

737
00:52:14,657 --> 00:52:16,493
哪種商人
What kinda business?

738
00:52:19,621 --> 00:52:20,872
收購業
Acquisitions.

739
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:28,838
你怎麼知道在哪可以找到我的
How'd you know where to find me?

740
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,424
看看這周圍
You seen this place?

741
00:52:31,466 --> 00:52:35,303
只要有新人 我就會知道
Somebody new walks into town, I hear about it.

742
00:52:36,805 --> 00:52:40,975
另外 小貝利可是我的人
Besides, little Billy over there has a sweet spot for me.

743
00:52:55,448 --> 00:52:56,950
想那啥不
Wanna take a ride?

744
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:00,120
帶路
Lead the way.

745
00:53:45,957 --> 00:53:47,876
-嗨 姑娘們 -早上好
- Hi ladies. - Good morning.

746
00:53:47,917 --> 00:53:50,670
-嘿 爸爸 -我女兒醒了
- Hey Daddy. - Well, my daughter's awake.

747
00:53:50,712 --> 00:53:52,881
爸爸 這是傑克·謝依
Daddy, meet Jack Shea.

748
00:53:52,922 --> 00:53:54,507
傑克 這是查理
Jack, meet Charlie.

749
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,676
羅斯先生
Mr. Rose.

750
00:53:58,261 --> 00:54:01,431
馬蒂從來沒說過你是這樣的老手
Marty never said you were such a city slicker.

751
00:54:01,473 --> 00:54:03,933
有問題嗎
Is that gonna be a problem?

752
00:54:03,975 --> 00:54:08,771
不 沒問題 除非你不安分
No, not a problem, unless you make it that way.

753
00:54:08,813 --> 00:54:11,357
你們現在還沒在一起 對吧
You all didn't do nothing together, now, did you?

754
00:54:11,399 --> 00:54:12,400
噢 爸爸
Oh, Daddy.

755
00:54:13,526 --> 00:54:16,654
好了 我只是和你開玩笑
Oh, come on, I'm just playing with you.

756
00:54:16,696 --> 00:54:19,949
過來聊一會
Come on over here and chat for a while.

757
00:54:25,705 --> 00:54:30,543
姑娘們 你們為什麼不進屋涼快去呢
Ladies, why don't you go on inside and cool off a bit?

758
00:54:30,585 --> 00:54:32,045
哦 寶貝
Aw, baby.

759
00:54:32,086 --> 00:54:33,546
-哈爾 -是的 老闆
- Hal? - Yes sir.

760
00:54:33,588 --> 00:54:35,882
姑娘們 請離開游泳池 馬上
Ladies, outta the pool, now.

761
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:42,805
你知道我很喜歡年輕的活力
You know I like to harness the energy of youth.

762
00:54:42,847 --> 00:54:44,390
來瓶啤酒嗎
You want a beer?

763
00:54:44,432 --> 00:54:47,268
聽著 羅斯先生 我來這的原因是
Look, Mr. Rose, the only reason I'm here

764
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:49,646
馬蒂說他在德克薩斯州有個朋友
is because Marty said he had a friend in Texas,

765
00:54:49,687 --> 00:54:50,855
就是這樣
and that's it.

766
00:54:52,482 --> 00:54:55,485
馬蒂就是個爛好人
Marty, Marty was thick as a brick.

767
00:54:56,611 --> 00:55:00,406
但他對人的判斷很準
But he was a tremendous judge of character.

768
00:55:00,448 --> 00:55:04,285
表面來看 你是達標的
Now, from appearance, you look like you're up to the mark,

769
00:55:04,327 --> 00:55:07,705
但我關心的是內在
but it's what's underneath that concerns me.

770
00:55:07,747 --> 00:55:11,584
如果你只是有勇無謀
If you'll crack when the heat gets cranked up.

771
00:55:15,547 --> 00:55:18,091
你也不會有什麼出息
You gotta keep a low profile.

772
00:55:18,132 --> 00:55:19,676
我這一生
I've been my entire life,

773
00:55:19,717 --> 00:55:23,930
什麼都嘗試過
and I never got so much as a hockey ticket.

774
00:55:24,289 --> 00:55:26,349
除了賭馬和石油
I only do outside horses and oil,

775
00:55:26,391 --> 00:55:29,930
我不在住的地方拉屎 你要明白我的意圖
and I don't shit where I live, if you catch my drift.

776
00:55:30,228 --> 00:55:34,399
我花了一整年的時間 只做一件事
I spend a whole year, an entire year, on a single project.

777
00:55:35,567 --> 00:55:38,403
但是報酬一直可觀
But the payoff is always worthwhile.

778
00:55:40,697 --> 00:55:42,282
價值少於500萬
And I don't touching nothing,

779
00:55:42,323 --> 00:55:46,703
我不會動手
unless it'll fetch at least five million U.S.

780
00:55:46,744 --> 00:55:49,414
我有一個團隊 大家輪流做隊長
I use a crew, and I rotate who's in charge.

781
00:55:49,455 --> 00:55:52,709
當奧利維亞不製造混亂時
Olivia there sometimes acts as another guy,

782
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:55,169
她也會一樣的出任務
when she's not causing chaos.

783
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:04,679
要知道 我從不用來自德克薩斯以外的人
You know, I never hire a man unless they're a Texas man.

784
00:56:04,721 --> 00:56:06,180
我只是不信任他們
I just don't trust 'em.

785
00:56:06,222 --> 00:56:09,267
但是馬緹和我親如兄弟
But Marty was a brother to me.

786
00:56:09,309 --> 00:56:11,936
所以我不會把你丟出去
So I'm not gonna throw you out.

787
00:56:13,688 --> 00:56:16,899
但你必須證明你自己
But you're gonna have to prove yourself.

788
00:56:16,941 --> 00:56:19,861
你認為怎麼樣
What do you think there, blue eyes?

789
00:56:29,245 --> 00:56:31,289
我們什麼時候開始
When do we get started?

790
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:36,085
7千5百萬怎麼樣
How does 75 mil sound?

791
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:05,740
下午好 斯特伯諾維特茲先生 和太太
Good afternoon, Mr. and Ms. Stroblekowitz.

792
00:57:05,782 --> 00:57:07,784
-今天怎麼樣 -很好 謝謝
How're y'all doing today? - Very well, thank you.

793
00:57:07,825 --> 00:57:09,327
比克爾先生已經在等你們了
Mr. Beeker's ready for you.

794
00:57:09,369 --> 00:57:11,204
弗林會帶你們去樓上
Flynn'll be taking you upstairs.

795
00:57:11,245 --> 00:57:12,955
請跟我來
Please follow me.

796
00:57:12,997 --> 00:57:14,415
-謝謝你 -祝心情愉快
- Thank you. - Y'all have a great day.

797
00:57:14,457 --> 00:57:16,292
-謝謝 -謝謝
- Thank you. - Thank you.

798
00:57:16,334 --> 00:57:18,586
西蒙·貝克爾 你所聽說過的
Simon Beeker was the president of the largest bank

799
00:57:18,628 --> 00:57:21,130
最大銀行的總裁
nobody ever heard of.

800
00:57:21,172 --> 00:57:25,009
貝克爾掌握著跨洋的金融業務
Beeker handled overseas financial transactions,

801
00:57:25,051 --> 00:57:27,470
以及資金的流向
how the money flowed.

802
00:57:27,512 --> 00:57:30,431
貝克爾沒有獲得一點利益
Just none of it flowed to Beeker.

803
00:57:30,473 --> 00:57:34,477
貝克爾先生 你的客人到了
Mr. Beeker, your clients have arrived.

804
00:57:36,813 --> 00:57:37,647
嗨
Hi.

805
00:57:38,648 --> 00:57:39,565
下午好
Afternoon.

806
00:57:39,607 --> 00:57:42,443
-請坐 -謝謝
- Please, have a seat. - Thank you.

807
00:57:44,987 --> 00:57:46,489
有什麼可以幫你的
What can I do for you?

808
00:57:46,531 --> 00:57:49,534
我們代表羅斯先生
We represent Mr. Rose's interests.

809
00:57:53,871 --> 00:57:54,914
是的 貝克爾先生
Yes, Mr. Beeker.

810
00:57:54,956 --> 00:57:57,375
櫻桃 你能讓保羅進來嗎
Cherry, can you send Paul in, please?

811
00:57:57,417 --> 00:57:58,543
馬上
Right away.

812
00:58:00,878 --> 00:58:01,713
嗯
Um.

813
00:58:03,798 --> 00:58:04,424
我
I, uh,

814
00:58:05,758 --> 00:58:08,094
我沒想到你這麼快
I didn't expect you so soon.

815
00:58:11,222 --> 00:58:13,391
時間加快了
The timeline's moved up.

816
00:58:35,997 --> 00:58:37,498
好了 貝克爾先生
Now, Mr. Beeker.

817
00:58:39,792 --> 00:58:43,296
地下室的密碼每天都換
We know the Vault's codes change daily.

818
00:58:43,337 --> 00:58:45,298
你的人在晚上十一點出現
Now your man, they show up at 11:00 PM,

819
00:58:45,339 --> 00:58:47,633
非常準時
not a second sooner or later,

820
00:58:47,675 --> 00:58:49,385
輸入密碼 我們就能過上好日子
with the codes, and we're golden.

821
00:58:49,427 --> 00:58:53,556
之後 我們就可以頤養天年了
Anything after that, we're not gonna do business.

822
00:58:55,516 --> 00:58:56,809
貝克爾先生
Now, Mr. Beeker.

823
00:58:56,851 --> 00:59:01,230
地下室裏有價值7干5百萬的債券
We know that there's 75 million in bonds in that vault.

824
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:04,984
7干5百萬 聽起來太棒了
75 mil sounds good.

825
00:59:05,026 --> 00:59:06,903
這次 我要做領隊
But this time I'm the leading man.

826
00:59:06,944 --> 00:59:09,530
-噢 不女士 你不行 -先生 我行的
- No ma'am, you are not. - Oh yes sir, I am.

827
00:59:09,572 --> 00:59:11,991
希望你能原諒 但是你不行
I beg your pardon, missy, but you are not.

828
00:59:12,033 --> 00:59:12,867
爸爸
Daddy.

829
00:59:15,578 --> 00:59:16,412
好吧
. Okay

830
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:20,416
各退一步吧 小姑娘
You wanna wheel and deal, missy?

831
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:22,168
你帶上哈爾

835
00:59:33,429 --> 00:59:34,931
你真不帶
Do we have a deal?

836
00:59:36,098 --> 00:59:38,726
羅斯先生的分利是10%
Mr. Rose's cut is 10 cents on the dollar.

837
00:59:38,768 --> 00:59:40,645

I was happy.

843
01:00:13,344 --> 01:00:15,847
就像是 第一次
It seemed like, just for once,

844
01:00:17,014 --> 01:00:19,475
我得到了上帝的眷顧
God smiled down on me.

845
01:00:19,517 --> 01:00:22,144
你知道我多愛你嗎
You know how much I love you?

846

我有個活 需要一個司機
I got a job, I need a driver.

850
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:56,679
讓我來
Yeah, I can drive.

851
01:00:56,721 --> 01:00:57,430
我能得多少
How much?

852
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:59,515
正常水平
The usual amount.

853
01:00:59,557 --> 01:01:00,850
什麼時候開始
What time do y'all need me there?

854
01:01:00,892 --> 01:01:02,184
這幾天吧
Couple days.

855
01:01:02,226 --> 01:01:03,561
保持手機通暢
Keep your phone on.

856
01:01:03,603 --> 01:01:05,021
隨時聽候
I'll be in touch.

857
01:01:06,856 --> 01:01:07,690
好了
It's done.

858
01:01:12,904 --> 01:01:15,740
有時你得把韁繩抓在手裏
Sometimes you gotta keep the training wheels on,

859
01:01:15,781 --> 01:01:18,618
即使它們想自由
even though they wanna roll alone.

860
01:01:47,438 --> 01:01:49,231
我們包圍了這裏
We cased the place.

861
01:01:49,273 --> 01:01:51,359
我們有設計圖 守衛時間表
We had blueprints, guard schedules,

862
01:01:51,392 --> 01:01:54,243
查理甚至弄來了安全系統的備份
and Charlie even had a duplicate

863
01:01:54,314 --> 01:01:56,405
來給我練習
of the security system made for me to practice.

864
01:01:56,447 --> 01:01:59,241
一切準備就緒
We had all the bases covered.

865
01:01:59,283 --> 01:02:00,618
好的
Okay.

866
01:02:14,382 --> 01:02:16,149
我們穿的像去參加葬禮一樣
We look like we're dressed for a funeral.

867
01:02:16,454 --> 01:02:17,885
我看見你把兄弟們帶來了
I see you brought your boyfriends,

868
01:02:17,927 --> 01:02:18,719
密碼帶了嗎
did you bring the codes?

869
01:02:18,761 --> 01:02:20,554
這就是我們來這的原因 傑克
That's why we're here, Jack.

870
01:02:20,596 --> 01:02:22,682
那麼開始幹活吧
Then let's get to work.

871
01:02:23,891 --> 01:02:26,435
-嘿 -直盯著掃瞄器好嗎
Hey, keep an eye on the scanners, alright?

872
01:02:26,477 --> 01:02:29,397
確保無死角監控
Make sure all the edges are sealed.

873
01:02:53,671 --> 01:02:55,131
這是貝克爾的私人樓層
This is Beeker's private floor.

874
01:02:55,172 --> 01:02:57,174
沒有攝像頭
There's no cameras here.

875
01:02:59,176 --> 01:03:00,261
走這邊
There you go.

876
01:03:01,766 --> 01:03:03,254
貝克爾用攝像頭
Beeker put the security cameras

877
01:03:03,265 --> 01:03:06,027
把金庫全方位的監控起來了
in the vault on loop.

878
01:03:07,184 --> 01:03:08,019
幹得好
Nice.

879
01:03:11,105 --> 01:03:12,401
我們爭取了一小時
We got an hour,

880
01:03:12,412 --> 01:03:14,993
然後貝克爾來分他的那一份
then Beeker will be here to get his cut.

881
01:03:21,782 --> 01:03:22,616
密碼
Codes.

882
01:03:24,702 --> 01:03:25,578
給
Here.

883
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,473
如果其中一個數字是錯的
If even one of those numbers is wrong,

884
01:03:29,497 --> 01:03:31,333
我們就要被警察甕中捉鱉了
half the police department'll show up outside.

885
01:03:31,375 --> 01:03:32,793
聽著 小姐
Listen, little lady.

886
01:03:32,835 --> 01:03:34,639
這是貝克爾親口告訴我的
I got it from Beeker himself.

887
01:03:34,741 --> 01:03:36,797
我一字不差的寫下來的
Wrote the numbers down exactly the way he told me.

888
01:03:36,839 --> 01:03:38,591
壓力會讓人出錯的
Pressure changes things.

889
01:03:38,632 --> 01:03:42,178
讓一個人寫6而不是9
Makes a man write a six instead of a nine.

890
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:44,388
不是貝克爾 他很堅強
Not Beeker, the man's ice.

891
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:46,849
我說的是你
I was talking about you.

892
01:03:46,891 --> 01:03:49,477
你倆吵完了嗎
You two about done bickering?

893
01:03:54,774 --> 01:03:56,400
你老公是個弱雞
Your husband's a prick.

894
01:03:56,442 --> 01:03:58,778
你能夠得更好的
You could do so much better.

895
01:04:07,161 --> 01:04:09,205
呦 這是啥
Yo, what's it doing?

896
01:04:09,246 --> 01:04:10,956
校準報警器
It's synchronized the alarms,

897
01:04:10,998 --> 01:04:12,625
正在破譯階段
it's deciphering codes in stages.

898
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:15,419
每個階段的顏色不同
Each stage has a different color.

899
01:04:30,392 --> 01:04:33,896
我們在等什麼啊
What the hell are we waiting for?

900
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:40,611
等這個
That.

901
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:50,454
貝克爾在車裏
Beeker's in the van.

902
01:04:50,496 --> 01:04:52,748
我們會在那分錢
We'll split the bonds up there.

903
01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:54,917
你知道的 有件事一直困擾我
You know, something's been bothering me.

904
01:04:54,959 --> 01:04:57,002
貝克爾為什麼要來
Now why would Beeker show up here in person

905
01:04:57,044 --> 01:04:59,004
讓自己陷入危險
and put himself at risk?

906
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:08,764
該死
Fuck.

907
01:05:14,603 --> 01:05:16,856
奧利維亞 趴下
Olivia, stay down.

908
01:05:37,126 --> 01:05:39,253
奧利維亞 我們必須立刻離開
Olivia, we gotta get the fuck out now.

909
01:05:39,295 --> 01:05:40,379
我不會丟下傑克
I'm not leaving Jack.

910
01:05:40,421 --> 01:05:42,214
不用管我 跟他走
Don't worry about me, go with him.

911
01:05:42,256 --> 01:05:43,591
快走
Get out of here.

912
01:05:50,806 --> 01:05:51,932
把門打開
Unlock this door.

913
01:05:51,974 --> 01:05:54,059
聽著 我幫不了傑克 我只能幫你
Look, I can't help Jack, I can only help you.

914
01:05:56,020 --> 01:06:00,649
你不能丟下傑克
You are not leaving Jack.

915
01:06:00,691 --> 01:06:02,943
我特麼就是幹這個的 混蛋
I'm getting paid, motherfucker.

916
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:14,330
傑克 傑克 你在麼 小夥伴
Jack, oh Jack, you out there, son?

917
01:06:15,414 --> 01:06:18,209
聽著我有話要澄清 哥們
Listen I got a confession to make, pal.

918
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:19,835
你妻子在我耳邊悄悄說
Your wife whispered in my ear

919
01:06:19,877 --> 01:06:22,588
她想和我共度良宵
that she wants to suck my dick.

920
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:23,756
你喜歡嗎
You like that?

921
01:06:25,925 --> 01:06:27,718
我和你做個交易
I'll make you a deal.

922
01:06:29,386 --> 01:06:33,057
你把屬於我的東西給我 我就放過你
You give me what's mine and I'll let you go.

923
01:06:34,558 --> 01:06:36,310
不應該是這樣的 傑克
It wasn't supposed to be like this, Jack.

924
01:06:36,352 --> 01:06:37,102
是嗎
Oh yeah?

925
01:06:37,144 --> 01:06:38,520
應該是怎樣的
How was it supposed to be?

926
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:40,356
你殺了我們然後拿走債券
You kill us and take the bonds?

927
01:06:40,397 --> 01:06:43,776
你說對了
You got it.

928
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,656
嘿 出去把他幹掉
Hey, get the fuck out there.

929
01:06:55,913 --> 01:06:57,248
幹得漂亮 傑克
Nice shot, Jack.

930
01:06:58,666 --> 01:07:00,125
可惜不是我
Too bad it wasn't me.

931
01:07:00,167 --> 01:07:01,710
聽著 去他媽的貝克爾
Listen, fuck Beeker.

932
01:07:01,752 --> 01:07:03,879
憑什麼他應該拿錢
Why should he get the money?

933
01:07:03,921 --> 01:07:08,175
我和你 我們平分這筆錢
Me and you, we split the money, 50/50.

934
01:07:08,217 --> 01:07:09,718
聽起來怎麼樣
How's that sound?

935
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,303
聽起來完全是胡扯
Sounds like bullshit.

936
01:07:17,101 --> 01:07:18,018
傑克
Hey Jack.

937
01:07:19,478 --> 01:07:22,398
殺了你以後 我就上了你女人
After I kill you, I'm gonna fuck that little whore of yours.

938
01:07:22,439 --> 01:07:24,233
你現在可以不和我合作
You keep what's mine.

939
01:07:52,553 --> 01:07:53,345
該死
Oh shit.

940
01:07:57,808 --> 01:07:58,976
你聽到了嗎
You hear that?

941
01:08:00,477 --> 01:08:03,939
我們都會進監獄的
We're both gonna go to fucking prison.

942
01:08:09,236 --> 01:08:11,155
你不會
You wouldn't, uh,

943
01:08:11,196 --> 01:08:14,116
你不會在人背後開槍的 對吧
you wouldn't shoot a man in the back, would you?

944
01:08:17,661 --> 01:08:18,954
不 我會的
Yes, I would.

945
01:08:25,669 --> 01:08:28,839
槍 他有槍
Gun, he's got a gun.

946
01:08:30,341 --> 01:08:32,634
天哪 我們這有緊急情況

請求增援
Call for backup.

948
01:08:48,609 --> 01:08:51,028
瑪格麗特 再別提了
Margaret, don't bring it up again.

949
01:08:51,070 --> 01:08:55,324
告訴那些傢伙車庫有一個梯子
Just tell the guys there's a ladder in the garage,

950
01:08:55,366 --> 01:08:59,870
或者我們租他們的 因為他們收你租金
or we'll rent theirs, 'cause they'll charge you rent.

951
01:08:59,912 --> 01:09:02,373
讓他們爬到屋頂上
And have them climb up on the roof

952
01:09:02,414 --> 01:09:06,043
別告訴他們我們沒有保險
and don't tell 'em we don't have insurance.

953
01:09:08,504 --> 01:09:10,297
不 我現在不打算和你探討這個
No, I'm not gonna discuss it with you now,

954
01:09:10,339 --> 01:09:12,591
我回家後再說
I'll do it when I get home.

你的工作是成為蜘蛛俠
And your job is trying to be Spiderman

968
01:09:51,505 --> 01:09:55,592
爬上二樓做壞事
and climb up to second stories and do bad things.

969
01:09:57,428 --> 01:09:58,971
然後你就被抓了
And you got caught.

970

Very good, you'll do.

974
01:10:33,046 --> 01:10:34,660
你用不著遮遮掩掩的 夥計
You don't need to cover it, bud,

975
01:10:34,671 --> 01:10:37,475
不論你有什麼我們都不會驚訝的
we couldn't be shocked by anything you'd have.

976
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:45,934
-你好啊 小伙子 -先生
Hello son. Sir.

977
01:10:48,312 --> 01:10:50,272
-今天過得怎麼樣先生 -很好先生
- How're you today, sir? - Good, sir.

978
01:10:50,314 --> 01:10:51,398
好
Good.

979
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,524
你呢
How about you?

980
01:10:52,566 --> 01:10:53,596
準備好離開這了
About ready to get out of here.

981
01:10:53,643 --> 01:10:55,061
非常好 先生
Very good, sir.

982
01:11:00,157 --> 01:11:00,908
嘿
HEY

983
01:11:05,913 --> 01:11:07,789
好吧 不管用
Well, that didn't work.

984
01:11:07,831 --> 01:11:09,791
也許你只是沒禮貌
Maybe you're just rude.

985
01:11:12,252 --> 01:11:14,421
你不懂禮節
You don't have manners.

986
01:11:14,463 --> 01:11:18,634
當有比你年長者站在你牢門外的時候
When one of your betters is outside and front of the bars,

987
01:11:20,344 --> 01:11:21,929
你站起來 轉過身
you stand up, turn around,

988
01:11:21,970 --> 01:11:24,806
直視他的眼睛
and look him in the goddamned eye.

989
01:11:32,773 --> 01:11:35,025
差不多就是這樣
That's more like it.

990
01:11:35,067 --> 01:11:37,152
你知道我需要你幹什麼嗎
You know what I need from you?

991
01:11:37,194 --> 01:11:38,487
你的注意力
Your attention.

992
01:11:39,863 --> 01:11:42,269
並且是每一次我關注你的時候
And I'm gonna demand it

993
01:11:42,308 --> 01:11:44,368
你都要關注我
every time I look in your fucking eyes.

994
01:11:50,123 --> 01:11:53,293
我們的牢房還不錯吧
How're you enjoying our fine facility?

995
01:11:55,295 --> 01:11:58,048
我希望能達到你的標準
I hope it's up to your standards.

996
01:11:59,716 --> 01:12:01,385
你喜歡嗎
Is it to your liking?

997
01:12:03,387 --> 01:12:05,389
或者說你看到更好的了
Or have you seen better?

998
01:12:07,349 --> 01:12:11,061
又或者說你更喜歡在地下的洞裏
Or would you rather be in a hole underground?

999
01:12:12,229 --> 01:12:13,689
你聽見了嗎
Can you hear me?!

1000
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:19,194
因為你聽我說話很重要
Because it's important you hear me.

1001
01:12:19,236 --> 01:12:21,280
每次我看到你的臉
Every time I've ever looked in your face,

1002
01:12:21,321 --> 01:12:23,198
即使是在我的辦公室
even back in my office,

1003
01:12:26,243 --> 01:12:28,328
你從都是對我目不轉睛
you never took your eyes off me.

1004
01:12:28,370 --> 01:12:31,456
我可沒那麼大的魅力 小伙子
I'm not that fucking attractive, bud.

1005
01:12:36,712 --> 01:12:38,964
你經常給我這種黃金凝視
You always give me that gold stare,

1006
01:12:39,006 --> 01:12:42,634
這他媽根本不管用 你永遠都嚇不了我
it don't mean shit to me, you're not gonna scare me down.

1007
01:12:42,676 --> 01:12:44,595
你明白了嗎
You understand that, don't you?

1008
01:12:44,636 --> 01:12:48,473
我才不管你認為自己有多壞
I don't care how bad you think you are.

1009
01:12:48,515 --> 01:12:51,602
你不會和劊子手一樣壞
You're not as bad as the executioner.

1010
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:47,199
嘿 咸魚
Hey, fish.

1011
01:13:48,992 --> 01:13:50,202
能明白我的娛樂方式嗎
Got my jollies?

1012
01:13:51,995 --> 01:13:53,288
你知道這發生了什麼嗎
Do you know what's happening here?

1013
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:54,462
你知道發生什麼了嗎
You know what's happening?

1014
01:13:54,509 --> 01:13:56,291
-滾開 -撿肥皂呢 小子
- Fuck off. - Party, motherfucker.

1015
01:13:56,333 --> 01:13:58,020
一個盛大的派對
A big party.

1016
01:13:58,145 --> 01:13:59,336
到這裏來
Get over here.

1017
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,701
我要爆你菊花 漂亮的男孩
I'm gonna skullfuck you, pretty boy.

1018
01:15:08,321 --> 01:15:11,867
來自獄長的小禮物
A little present from the Warden.

1019
01:15:49,321 --> 01:15:50,989
棒極了 這就是贏定了
Hell yeah, that's what's up.

1020
01:15:51,031 --> 01:15:52,741
你這特麼的是什麼
What the fuck are you?

1021
01:16:12,636 --> 01:16:14,387
還記得我嗎 混球
Remember me, motherfucker?

1022
01:16:32,572 --> 01:16:36,159
你壞事做盡 小伙子
You've been up to a lot of bad shit, son.

1023
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:51,258
為什麼我要留下
Why do I stay?

1024
01:16:55,303 --> 01:16:58,306
我留下是因為我喜歡壞人
You know what I stay, 'cause I like bad guys.

1025
01:16:58,348 --> 01:17:01,810
因為他們不想成為壞人
Because they don't wanna be bad guys.

1026
01:17:01,852 --> 01:17:04,229
他們都認為我們是壞人
And a lot of 'em think we're the bad guys,

1027
01:17:04,271 --> 01:17:05,772
我是個壞人
and I'm a bad guy.

1028
01:17:07,524 --> 01:17:11,778
我喜歡罪犯 他們很敬業
And I like criminals, professionals at what they do.

1029
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:14,197
我尤其喜歡二樓的那個
I particularly like the second story man,

1030
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:17,075
因為他很健壯 動作敏捷
'cause he's gotta be athletic, he's gotta be agile.

1031
01:17:17,117 --> 01:17:18,952
他很有想法
He's gotta think.

1032
01:17:18,994 --> 01:17:20,745
你把這些足智多謀的人聚集在一起
You put all that ingenuity together,

1033
01:17:20,787 --> 01:17:23,915
你只是在想 我們為什麼不能好好相處呢
and you wonder, why can't we all just get along?

1034
01:17:23,957 --> 01:17:27,335
你想表達啥 獄長
What's your proposition, Warden?

1035
01:17:27,377 --> 01:17:31,131
你知道罪犯和執法者之間的
You know the difference between a criminal,

1036
01:17:32,674 --> 01:17:33,842
區別嗎
and a law man?

1037
01:17:37,971 --> 01:17:38,805
第一
One,

1038
01:17:42,559 --> 01:17:46,771
住所免費 免費三餐供應 免費住宿
lives rent free, three meals a day, a bed.

1039
01:17:46,813 --> 01:17:47,939
另一個呢
The other one,

1040
01:17:52,569 --> 01:17:54,571
連租金都付不起
can't even pay his rent.

1041
01:17:56,907 --> 01:18:00,744
我們那位東海岸的"叔叔"
And our uncle, who lives back there on the east coast,

1042
01:18:00,785 --> 01:18:03,455
不會給我這樣的人付錢
doesn't pay people like me shit.

1043
01:18:05,081 --> 01:18:07,893
現在我在考慮不久後的退休
Now I'm thinking of retiring soon.

1044
01:18:08,366 --> 01:18:10,535
我有三個女兒
And I got three daughters.

1045
01:18:12,255 --> 01:18:13,882
所以你掂量一下
So you do the math.

1046
01:18:15,383 --> 01:18:16,801
你知道騙子和執法者之間
You know what the real difference

1047
01:18:16,843 --> 01:18:19,888
真正的區別嗎獄長
is between crooks and law men is, Warden?

1048
01:18:19,930 --> 01:18:21,264
告訴我
Try me.

1049
01:18:21,306 --> 01:18:23,524
是在牢門的哪一邊
What side of the bars they're on.

1050
01:18:24,684 --> 01:18:26,298
很聰明
That's clever.

1051
01:18:27,103 --> 01:18:28,313
你這樣的覺悟
With a mind like that,

1052
01:18:28,355 --> 01:18:31,399
不應該被關在這樣的地方
you should be nowhere near an institution like this.

1053
01:18:31,441 --> 01:18:33,526
你願意餘生都在這裏渡過嗎
You wanna stay here the rest of your life?

1054
01:18:33,568 --> 01:18:35,403
還是你想出去
Or you wanna be out there?

1055
01:18:35,445 --> 01:18:37,538
你想讓你的妹子圍著
You want your girl running around,

1056
01:18:37,585 --> 01:18:40,366
監獄跑圈嗎 她是那樣的姑娘嗎
outside the walls of this prison, looking like she does?

1057
01:18:41,159 --> 01:18:42,827
沒有監管
Without supervision?

1058
01:18:43,954 --> 01:18:45,413
我認為不是
I don't think so.

1059
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:51,294
現在 你更想留在這裏還是出去
Now, in your own mind, are you better in or out?

1060
01:18:52,545 --> 01:18:54,943
因為這正是我們所討論的
Because that's what we're talking about.

1061
01:18:55,334 --> 01:18:58,555
我們做筆交易 然後你想去哪都可以
So let's make a deal, and you can take a hike,

1062
01:18:58,649 --> 01:19:01,429
我也不會再做那個討人厭的獄長
and I can quit being a fucking warden.

1063
01:19:03,994 --> 01:19:05,547
如果你打算和我做這個交易
If you're gonna make a deal with me,

1064
01:19:05,557 --> 01:19:07,519
你就和我握手
you're gonna shake my hand.

1065
01:19:13,108 --> 01:19:13,942
成交
Deal.

1066
01:19:24,494 --> 01:19:26,579
獄長的觀點很簡單
The Warden's proposition was simple.

1067
01:19:26,621 --> 01:19:28,206
一些告密者洩露的情報
Some snitch had let it slip

1068
01:19:28,248 --> 01:19:31,584
邊境地帶會有一次毒品交易
that a drug deal was going down by the border.

1069
01:19:31,626 --> 01:19:35,672
讓我去拿現金 他就是乾淨的
Having me get the cash kept his hands clean.

1070
01:19:35,714 --> 01:19:38,633
作為回報 我可以離開監獄
And in return, I got a get outta jail free card

1071
01:19:38,675 --> 01:19:43,304
一個新的身份 人生的第二次機會
with a new identity, and a second chance at life.

1072
01:19:43,346 --> 01:19:44,663
而且我很幸運
And lucky for me,

1073
01:19:44,854 --> 01:19:47,707
有個善良的女人在身後等我
there was a good hearted woman waiting.

1074
01:19:56,609 --> 01:19:57,527
你還好嗎
You okay?

1075
01:19:58,528 --> 01:20:01,114
你不必這麼做的
You don't have to do this.

1076
01:20:01,156 --> 01:20:03,491
我們可以離開這裏 重新開始
We can go away, start again.

1077
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:10,415
不管在哪我們都只能幹這行
We'll just have to do it someplace else.

1078
01:20:11,332 --> 01:20:12,333
-獄長 -說
- Warden. - Yeah.

1079
01:20:12,375 --> 01:20:15,170
我們到了 正在停車
Yeah, we're here, we're packing in.

1080
01:20:15,211 --> 01:20:18,173
交易結束前把他看住了
Just stay with him until the deal's done.

1081
01:20:18,214 --> 01:20:20,175
你明白了嗎
You understand that, right?

1082
01:20:20,216 --> 01:20:21,051
明白
Got it.

1083
01:20:36,357 --> 01:20:40,028
小子 你的槍法最好有你自己說的那麼好
You better be the shot you say you are, boy.

1084
01:21:03,051 --> 01:21:05,386
我什麼都看不到
I can't see a goddamn thing.

1085
01:21:18,358 --> 01:21:20,819
準備好擴音器
Get ready with the bullhorn.

1086
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:49,556
只要你們按我說的做
No one else needs to get hurt.

1087
01:21:49,597 --> 01:21:52,100
你們的命就可以保住
You just do exactly what I say.

1088
01:21:52,142 --> 01:21:56,688
放下槍 把鑰匙丟掉 然後走開
Drop your guns, throw your keys, and keep walking.

1089
01:21:56,729 --> 01:21:59,232
一直走 不要回頭
Walk away and don't look back.

1090
01:22:02,068 --> 01:22:04,904
你只殺了兩個 混賬東西
You only killed two, goddamn it.

1091
01:22:06,805 --> 01:22:08,634
沒必要殺剩下那兩個人
There's no need to kill the rest.

1092
01:22:08,697 --> 01:22:11,661
我來定生死 別忘記你只是個犯人
I'll say what is needed, convict.

1093
01:22:44,527 --> 01:22:47,155
約定裏沒說要把毒品帶回去
Drugs weren't part of the deal.

1094
01:22:47,197 --> 01:22:49,032
是你的約定 不是我們的
Your deal, not ours.

1095
01:23:23,566 --> 01:23:24,943
-幹嘛 -獄長
- Yeah. - Warden.

1096
01:23:24,984 --> 01:23:27,278
他們住進了 你讓他們去的汽車旅館
They checked into the motel you got 'em.

1097
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:28,488
很好
That's good.

1098
01:23:29,489 --> 01:23:31,366
你知道這事是怎樣的
You know what the story is.

1099
01:23:31,407 --> 01:23:32,951
是
Yeah.

1100
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:35,578
你知道你應該幹什麼吧
You know what you have to do.

1101
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:37,247
-明白了嗎 -明白
Got it? - Copy that.

1102
01:23:51,094 --> 01:23:52,595
獄長的人拿了那些毒品
Warden's man took the drugs,

1103
01:23:52,637 --> 01:23:55,556
但我手上拿著那些錢
but I held onto the money.

1104
01:23:55,598 --> 01:23:57,558
明早他會在旅館跟我見面
He'd meet me at the hotel in the morning,

1105
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,145
我會用這些錢換我的新生活
and I'd exchange his money for my new life.

1106
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:17,370
早上我們把這些錢給莫頓
In the morning we'll just give this money to Morton.

1107
01:24:17,412 --> 01:24:18,663
一切就結束了
And we're done.

1108
01:24:20,039 --> 01:24:21,833
我不確定
I don't know.

1109
01:24:21,874 --> 01:24:24,085
這事總感覺不對勁
This whole thing feels off.

1110
01:24:28,548 --> 01:24:31,301
你保證 這是最後一次了
Promise me, this is the last one.

1111
01:24:33,469 --> 01:24:34,887
我不能失去你
I can't lose you.

1112
01:24:43,855 --> 01:24:45,481
我答應 但有一個條件
On one condition.

1113
01:24:51,654 --> 01:24:55,408
你願意和我度過佘生嗎
Will you spend the rest of your life with me?

1114
01:24:55,450 --> 01:24:56,284
我願意
Yes.

1115
01:25:02,915 --> 01:25:03,916
戴上看看
Try it on.

1116
01:25:08,588 --> 01:25:09,422
很合適
It fits.

1117
01:25:10,381 --> 01:25:12,383
你覺得它怎麼樣
What do you think?

1118
01:25:12,425 --> 01:25:13,843
它很美
It's beautiful.

1119
01:25:19,557 --> 01:25:22,560
在光線下看起來怎麼樣
Tell me how it looks in the light.

1120
01:25:24,812 --> 01:25:25,980
閃閃發光
It sparkles.

1121
01:25:27,565 --> 01:25:29,984
像你的眼睛一樣閃閃發光
It sparkles like your eyes.

1122
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,322
-我很喜歡 -希望如此
- I love it. - I hope so.

1123
01:25:41,454 --> 01:25:42,830
你把我慣壞了
You spoiled me.

1124
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:46,751
這一切結束後 等我們有足夠的錢
When all this is done, we'll have enough money.

1125
01:25:46,793 --> 01:25:47,919
我們就重新開始
We'll start over again.

1126
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:52,465
有個家 生兩個兒子
We're gonna have a house, maybe two baby boys.

1127
01:25:52,507 --> 01:25:53,716
我真的會金盆洗手的
I'll even retire, you know,

1128
01:25:53,758 --> 01:25:58,346
去當個郵遞員 做做普通人的工作
be a postman like a regular old job or something.

1129
01:25:58,388 --> 01:26:02,558
只要能每天在你身邊醒來
Just to be able to wake up every morning next to you.

1130
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:05,853
你覺得怎樣 親愛的
What do you think about that, babe?

1131
01:26:05,895 --> 01:26:07,647
我好愛你
I love you so much.

1132
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:10,942
我也愛你
I'm glad you do.

1133
01:26:18,616 --> 01:26:21,327
謝謝你 寶貝
Thank you, baby.

1134
01:26:26,582 --> 01:26:27,917
寶貝 趴下
Baby, get down.

1135
01:26:36,634 --> 01:26:39,137
快 去抓他
Go on, get him.

1136
01:27:03,995 --> 01:27:05,204
寶貝
. Baby

1137
01:27:05,246 --> 01:27:06,080
沒事的
It's okay.

1138
01:27:09,959 --> 01:27:13,379
不不 寶貝 你不會有事的 沒事的
No no, babe, no you're okay, you're okay.

1139
01:27:15,965 --> 01:27:19,260
你沒事的 你會好起來的
You're okay, hey, you're gonna be okay.

1140
01:27:21,471 --> 01:27:22,305
奧利維亞
Olivia.

1141
01:27:23,473 --> 01:27:24,974
求求你 不要睡過去
Please stay awake.

1142
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:27,185
再堅持一會就好
Just a little longer,

1143
01:27:27,226 --> 01:27:30,646
我們馬上就有個家了 我答應過你的
we're gonna get that house I promised you.

1144
01:27:30,688 --> 01:27:31,522
好嗎
Okay.

1145
01:27:33,024 --> 01:27:35,026
我們還有很多事要做
We got a lot left to do.

1146
01:27:38,070 --> 01:27:39,655
我愛你 傑克
I love you, Jack.

1147
01:27:45,786 --> 01:27:46,621
奧利維亞
Olivia.

1148
01:27:54,337 --> 01:27:55,171
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1149
01:28:04,514 --> 01:28:05,348
奧利維亞
Olivia.

1150
01:28:07,099 --> 01:28:09,769
求你了
Please.

1151
01:28:36,504 --> 01:28:37,338
嘀
Tick.

1152
01:28:38,714 --> 01:28:39,549
嘀嗒
Tick tock.

1153
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:41,592
嘀嗒
Tick tock.

1154
01:28:43,052 --> 01:28:43,886
嘀嗒
Tick tock.

1155
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:46,472
嘀嗒
Tick tock.

1156
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:48,975
嘀嗒
Tick tock.

1157
01:28:51,185 --> 01:28:52,019
嘀嗒
Tick tock.

1158
01:28:53,813 --> 01:28:54,647
嘀
Tick.

1159
01:28:56,774 --> 01:28:57,608
嗒
Tock.

1160
01:29:00,570 --> 01:29:01,362
嘀
Tick.

1161
01:29:03,739 --> 01:29:04,574
嗒
Tock.

1162
01:29:09,203 --> 01:29:10,413
事情就是這樣
And so it goes.

1163
01:29:12,999 --> 01:29:15,042
這很好
This was good.

1164
01:29:15,084 --> 01:29:17,378
今天有進展
This was a lot of progress.

1165
01:29:18,254 --> 01:29:19,088
然後
And,

1166
01:29:20,923 --> 01:29:22,282
明天我們討論一下你潛在的
tomorrow we'll get to the underlying--

1167
01:29:22,352 --> 01:29:24,688
明天我要見一個真正的醫生
Tomorrow I have a date with a real doctor.

1168
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:33,269
你知道最糟糕的是什麼嗎
You know what the worst part is?

1169
01:29:35,730 --> 01:29:38,899
沒人會為我送別
Nobody's gonna be there to see me off.

1170
01:29:44,530 --> 01:29:45,323
無論如何
Anyway

1171
01:29:48,242 --> 01:29:51,287
跟你談話很愉快 阿曼達
It was nice talking with you, Amanda.

1172
01:29:53,372 --> 01:29:54,707
我也是 傑克
You too, Jack.

1173
01:31:58,372 --> 01:32:01,000
我告訴你 他就是個該死的混蛋
I am telling you, he's one nasty son of a bitch.

1174
01:32:01,041 --> 01:32:03,669
他僱用年輕人 比競爭者們付更多的錢
He hires young, he pays more than all his competitors,

1175
01:32:03,711 --> 01:32:06,297
等他把他們弄到手了 就不會放手
and when he gets his hooks in 'em, he doesn't let go.

1176
01:32:06,338 --> 01:32:07,339
監察他所有的分析師
Check all his analysts.

1177
01:32:07,381 --> 01:32:08,841
監視他戰壕裏的狐朋狗友們
Even his guys down there in the trenches,

1178
01:32:08,883 --> 01:32:10,039
他們肯定會有所動作的
they're bound to make a mistake.

1179
01:32:10,078 --> 01:32:11,719
當他們行動時 我們會等著
And when they do, we will be ready.

1180
01:32:11,761 --> 01:32:13,220
讓他們在自投羅網
We will be ready.

1181
01:32:13,262 --> 01:32:15,285
-幹得不錯 卡特賴特先生 -謝謝
Good work, Mr. Cartwright. - Thank you.

1182
01:32:15,586 --> 01:32:16,587
真的不錯
Good work.

1183
01:32:20,644 --> 01:32:22,563
吉爾 我得跟她聊聊
Jill, give us a minute.

1184
01:32:23,689 --> 01:32:26,692
-好的 沒問題 -謝謝
- Yeah sure, no problem. - Thank you.

1185
01:32:27,902 --> 01:32:28,903
泰勒醫生
Dr. Tyler.

1186
01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:37,787
-這是給你的 -這是什麼
- There you go. - What do you got for me?

1187
01:32:51,634 --> 01:32:54,595
-你在逗我 -我很認真
You can't be serious. - I'm serious.

1188
01:32:57,473 --> 01:32:59,391
德克薩斯對約翰遜
Texas versus Johnson.

1189
01:33:00,810 --> 01:33:01,644
好吧
Okay.

1190
01:33:03,687 --> 01:33:06,982
醫生 你說你想拯救人的性命
You claim you wanna save lives, Doctor.

1191
01:33:08,108 --> 01:33:10,611
你宣揚為了正義而奮鬥
You preach fighting the good fight.

1192
01:33:10,653 --> 01:33:12,988
你在講堂裏宣揚所謂的正義
You wave your flag of justice around your lecture hall

1193
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:15,157
就像復仇的天使一般
like some avenging angel.

1194
01:33:16,075 --> 01:33:16,909
但這個
But this?

1195
01:33:18,118 --> 01:33:20,788
這不是病例研究
This is not a case study.

1196
01:33:20,830 --> 01:33:23,749
這也不是著書立說 弘揚道理 粉飾太平
This is not about theorizing, glorifying, or grandstanding.

1197
01:33:23,791 --> 01:33:27,628
泰勒醫生 這是因果報應
Dr. Tyler, this is about paying a debt.

1198
01:33:27,670 --> 01:33:30,089
這不僅是欠受害者家人的債
It's not just a debt to the families of the victims,

1199
01:33:30,130 --> 01:33:32,216
也是欠給社會的債 這才是正義
but to society, righting a terrible wrong,

1200
01:33:32,258 --> 01:33:33,843
防止以後再犯這樣的錯
and preventing future wrongs.

1201
01:33:33,884 --> 01:33:35,010
是保護那些無辜者
Protecting the innocent.

1202
01:33:35,052 --> 01:33:36,887
在所有人之中 你應當是最能理解的
And you, of all people, should understand that

1203
01:33:36,929 --> 01:33:38,889
因為你的丈夫是被謀殺的
since your husband was murdered.

1204
01:33:38,931 --> 01:33:40,266
我說得對嗎
Am I correct?

1205
01:33:40,307 --> 01:33:41,392
你說得沒錯
Yeah, you're correct.

1206
01:33:41,433 --> 01:33:42,810
我的丈夫的確是被謀殺的
My husband was murdered.

1207
01:33:42,852 --> 01:33:44,144
那我現在問你一個問題
So let me ask you a question.

1208
01:33:44,186 --> 01:33:45,229
說
Shoot.

1209
01:33:45,271 --> 01:33:47,648
要是這一次 持續這個惡性循環
What if this time, perpetuating the cycle

1210
01:33:47,690 --> 01:33:49,650
繼續往錯的方向走
and continuing down the wrong path,

1211
01:33:49,692 --> 01:33:51,986
保護一個本就殘缺的體系
and protecting a broken system,

1212
01:33:52,027 --> 01:33:53,654
就是對社會最有效的幫助
isn't what's best for society?

1213
01:33:53,696 --> 01:33:56,031
我們的系統非常完整 醫生
System's far from broken, Doctor.

1214
01:33:56,073 --> 01:33:58,367
我們現在所延續的
We're traveling down a path humanity's been navigating

1215
01:33:58,409 --> 01:34:00,619
就是人類建立社會文明的根本
since the dawn of society.

1216
01:34:00,661 --> 01:34:01,829
法律和秩序
Law and order.

1217
01:34:01,871 --> 01:34:03,038
犯罪與懲罰
Crime and punishment.

1218
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:04,832
以牙還牙
Tit for tat.

1219
01:34:04,874 --> 01:34:07,126
沒了這個體系
Without this system in place, we will surely

1220
01:34:07,167 --> 01:34:10,504
所有都要時刻保持警惕
be living in a constant state of hypersensitivity.

1221
01:34:10,546 --> 01:34:11,881
難道不是嗎
Wouldn't you say?

1222
01:34:11,922 --> 01:34:14,101
並不是的 人類已經向更高的階段發展了
No, we've moved beyond that.

1223
01:34:14,156 --> 01:34:16,677
人類早就過了靠原始本能反應的階段了
We are past reacting off of just our primal instinct.

1224
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:19,179
我們現在處於更高等的階段了
We've moved beyond.

1225
01:34:19,221 --> 01:34:20,556
好吧 醫生 好吧
Okay, Doc. Okay.

1226
01:34:22,391 --> 01:34:25,060
看看你正在和誰說話
Look who you're talking to here.

1227
01:34:26,312 --> 01:34:28,397
那麼 你告訴我
You're gonna sit here and tell me this.

1228
01:34:28,439 --> 01:34:30,608
儘管他是個西裝革履受過良好教育的黑人
Even though an educated black man in a three piece suit

1229
01:34:30,649 --> 01:34:32,026
然而在德克薩斯
right here in the good state of Texas

1230
01:34:32,067 --> 01:34:34,301
依然沒法在不被人誤以為是罪犯的情況下
can't run down the street

1231
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:35,299
走在街上
without possibly being mistaken for a criminal

1232
01:34:35,326 --> 01:34:37,411
或者像隻狗一樣被一槍打死
and shot down like a dog?

1233
01:34:38,407 --> 01:34:40,618
這代表著人類的進化嗎
That we have evolved.

1234
01:34:40,659 --> 01:34:43,871
這點我不敢茍同
I'd have to argue against that, Doctor.

1235
01:34:47,641 --> 01:34:49,309
這是一種微妙的平衡
It's a delicate balance.

1236
01:34:49,460 --> 01:34:52,796
懲罰太過嚴厲 就有反抗
Punish too harshly, you have a revolt.

1237
01:34:52,838 --> 01:34:55,549
懲罰不夠 社會就會動盪
Don't punish enough, you have anarchy.

1238
01:34:55,591 --> 01:34:59,303
對暴力的恐懼才能制約暴力
See, the very fear of violence keeps violence at bay.

1239
01:34:59,345 --> 01:35:01,013
我們要做的不是以暴制暴
By not responding to violence with violence,

1240
01:35:01,055 --> 01:35:02,973
如果我們消除了對暴力的恐懼
we take away that fear,

1241
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:05,851
我們便毀了
and we take away the very thing

1242
01:35:05,893 --> 01:35:07,471
唯一能讓這個社會安定的因素
that keeps our system intact.

1243
01:35:07,572 --> 01:35:09,178
所以 醫生 我們的體系不是殘缺的
So no, Doctor, our system is not broken,

1244
01:35:09,189 --> 01:35:10,564
我們沒有走錯路
we are not headed down the wrong path.

1245
01:35:10,606 --> 01:35:13,025
我在為這個社會盡責
I'm doing my job for society.

1246
01:35:14,777 --> 01:35:17,988
而你卻不見得是在這麼做
Whether you are or not is yet to be seen.

1247
01:35:18,030 --> 01:35:20,950
那麼同情與憐憫呢
What about compassion and empathy?

1248
01:35:20,991 --> 01:35:22,368
仁慈呢
And mercy?

1249
01:35:22,409 --> 01:35:23,243
仁慈
Mercy.

1250
01:35:26,622 --> 01:35:29,124
我們都只是棋盤上的棋子 醫生
We're all just pieces on the board, Doctor.

1251
01:35:29,166 --> 01:35:31,752
我們都只是棋子
We're just pieces on the board.

1252
01:35:32,878 --> 01:35:34,463
是嗎 那棋局最後
Yeah, well, at the end of the game,

1253
01:35:34,505 --> 01:35:39,134
國王和小兵都會被放到同一個盒子裏
the king and the pawns go in the same damn box.

1254
01:35:39,176 --> 01:35:40,552
你不想幫我
You don't wanna help me?

1255
01:35:40,594 --> 01:35:43,597
那我就自己把這個送到州長那兒去
I'll take it to the Governor myself.

1256
01:35:59,159 --> 01:36:00,447
到時間了
Time to go.

1257
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:27,451
我經過 那幽溪山谷
Yea, though I walk through

1258
01:37:27,493 --> 01:37:29,453
死亡的影子鋪陳其上
the valley of the shadow of death,

1259
01:37:29,495 --> 01:37:32,873
我不畏魔鬼 因你在身旁
I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.

1260
01:37:32,915 --> 01:37:36,168
你的棍杖 來撫慰我的心
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me,

1261
01:37:36,210 --> 01:37:37,961
再難言 仁慈與善良
surely the goodness of mercy

1262
01:37:38,003 --> 01:37:40,964
它們追隨至我生命盡頭
shall follow me all the days of my life.

1263
01:37:41,006 --> 01:37:45,177
我將終日憩息在主的蔭蔽下
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

1264
01:38:19,128 --> 01:38:22,297
有什麼遺言嗎 謝伊
Any last words, Shea?

1265
01:38:55,312 --> 01:38:57,689
最糟糕的是
he worst part is,

1266
01:38:57,919 --> 01:39:01,005
沒人會來為我送行
nobody's gonna be there to see me off.

1267
01:39:06,991 --> 01:39:11,514
拒絕簽特赦令
*

1268
01:39:51,511 --> 01:39:52,554
我愛你
I love you.

1269
01:39:59,603 --> 01:40:01,104
你很快就和我在一起了
I'll see you soon.

1270
01:40:59,079 --> 01:40:59,955
暴力
Violence.

1271
01:41:00,956 --> 01:41:02,457
由什麼引起的
What is the cause?

1272
01:41:03,421 --> 01:41:05,502
要真正的瞭解暴力的本質
To truly understand the nature of violence,

1273
01:41:05,544 --> 01:41:08,004
我們要超越個體地去看待它
we need to look beyond the individual.

1274
01:41:08,714 --> 01:41:10,507
我們要去瞭解
We need to look at the culture of violence

1275
01:41:10,549 --> 01:41:12,342
滲透進我們社會的 暴力文化
that permeates our society.

1276
01:41:12,384 --> 01:41:13,593
我們同樣也需要瞭解
And we also need to look at the way

1277
01:41:13,635 --> 01:41:16,221
暴力的懲罰方式
that we punish those that commit acts of violence.

1278
01:41:16,263 --> 01:41:19,057
因為當我們以暴制暴
Because when we answer violence with violence

1279
01:41:19,099 --> 01:41:21,226
殺人償命的時候
and trade death for death,

1280
01:41:21,268 --> 01:41:25,689
我們只是在加重惡性循環
all we're doing is perpetuating a vicious cycle.

1281
01:41:25,731 --> 01:41:27,566
但假如你愛的人被謀殺了呢
But what if someone you love was murdered?

1282
01:41:27,607 --> 01:41:28,608
你會認為
Would you feel that answering

1283
01:41:28,650 --> 01:41:31,987
以暴制暴才是正確的事嗎
violence with violence is appropriate?

1284
01:41:42,372 --> 01:41:45,167
我相信在那一瞬間我會有這種想法
I believe I would feel that in the moment.

1285
01:41:45,208 --> 01:41:46,585
但我不希望他們的死
But I wouldn't want their deaths avenged

1286
01:41:46,626 --> 01:41:49,338
在一個殘忍而無常的體系裏 得到復仇
by a cruel and capricious system.
