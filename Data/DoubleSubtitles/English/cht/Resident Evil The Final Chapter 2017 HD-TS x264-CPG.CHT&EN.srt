1
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,780
人們說歷史由勝利者書寫
They say that history is written by the victors.

2
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,990
如今的歷史則由保護傘公司書寫
This then, is the history of the Umbrella Corporation.

3
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,900
科學運動家、教授詹姆斯·馬庫斯組建了該公司
Formed by crusading scientist, Professor James Marcus.

4
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,540
馬庫斯小女兒愛麗莎患有早衰癥
Marcus had a young daughter, Alicia, afflicted with progeria,

5
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,920
一種漸進性致命的消耗性疾病
a progressive, fatal, wasting disease.

6
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,210
能導致過早老化
Progeria caused premature aging.

7
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,970
當她25歲時 已經是90歲的體質
By the time she was 25, Alicia would have the body of a 90 year old.

8
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,520
馬庫斯竭盡全力解救她
Marcus was driven to save her.

9
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,830
但希望渺茫
But the odds seemed impossible.

10
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,690
儘管拚命發明解藥
And even as he worked desperately to create a cure,

11
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,400
這位父親會錄下女兒的聲音
the young girl's father would record his daughter,

12
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,180
記錄她的外貌 用來延續後代
her voice, her likeness, saving her for posterity.

13
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,590
接著迎來了大突破 馬庫斯發現了T病毒
But then a breakthrough came. Marcus discovered the T-Virus.

14
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,300
一經注射 它將探測並修復體內的壞細胞
Once injected, it would detect and repair damaged cells within the body.

15
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,040
那是個奇跡
It was a miracle.

16
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:49,780
愛麗莎被救活
The life of Alicia Marcus was saved.

17
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:55,200
T病毒有無數用途 可治療上千種疾病
The T-Virus had a myriad of applications, treating a thousand different diseases.

18
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,140
那夜 似乎沒有感染、疾病和衰老的
Overnight, it seemed a new era was dawning.

19
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,430
新世紀將要來臨
A world without the fear of infection, sickness or decay.

20
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,770
但事實並非如此
But it was not to be.

21
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,460
T病毒的確有副作用 但難以預測
For the T-Virus had certain, unforeseen side effects.

22
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,400
先生們 快過來
Sir, sir, over here!

23
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,620
沒有呼吸了
He's not breathing.

24
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,370
第一批不死者誕生
The first of the undead was born.

25
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,990
這件事被迅速掩蓋
The incident was quickly covered up.

26
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,010
結果 馬庫斯與他的商業夥伴亞歷山大·艾薩克博士
In the aftermath, James Marcus argued furiously with his business partner,

27
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,240
發生激勵爭吵
Dr. Alexander Isaacs.

28
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,960
不管花費多少 計劃必須終止
I don't care how much it costs. We have to close the program down.

29
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,190
- 詹姆斯 我們會破產 - 我意已決
- James, we're gonna be ruined. - My mind is made up.

30
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,230
真遺憾
Pity.

31
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,950
回去睡覺 愛麗莎  我只是跟你父親談談
Off to bed, Alicia. Your father and I are just talking.

32
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,380
回去吧
Go on.

33
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,430
艾薩克博士成為死去夥伴的女兒的監護人
Dr. Isaacs became the guardian of his dead partner's child.

34
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,720
也擁有了屬於她的股權
And her half of the company.

35
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,930
以崇高理想開始的公司
The corporation that had begun with such lofty ideals,

36
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,340
已因貪婪和霸權而墮落
had been seduced completely by greed, and power.

37
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,120
為協助管理保護傘公司的巨額利益
To help him control the now vast interests of the Umbrella Corporation,

38
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,070
艾薩克博士創造了強大的人工智能
Dr. Isaacs created a powerful artificial intelligence.

39
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,650
艾薩克用愛麗莎的肖像作為計算機的界面
Isaacs used the likeness of Alicia Marcus for the computer's interface.

40
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,030
命名為紅後
Isaacs called the computer The Red Queen.

41
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,250
十年前 浣熊市暴發疫情
Then, 10 years ago in Raccoon City, there was an outbreak.

42
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,220
T病毒從名為「蜂窩」的地下實驗室洩漏
The T-virus escaped from an underground laboratory called The Hive.

43
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,940
美國政府試圖引爆炸彈控制其蔓延
The American government attempted to contain the outbreak by detonating a bomb.

44
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,730
毀滅了浣熊市
It devastated Raccoon City.

45
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,680
但阻擋不了風媒傳染
But it couldn't stop the airborne infection.

46
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,990
病毒於數日內傳遍全球
The viral outbreak spread across the world within days.

47
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,060
人類屈服了
Humankind was brought to its knees.

48
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,690
最終 人類最後的、也是最美好的希望
Finally, the last and best hope of humanity,

49
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,530
聚集在華盛頓 進行最後一搏
gathered and took a last stand in Washington DC.

50
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,490
但沒人料到我們正踏入的
But we didn't realize that what we had walked into...

51
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,030
是個陷阱 我叫愛麗絲 這是我的故事
Was a trap. My name is Alice. And this is my story.

52
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,770
我講完了
The end of my story.

53
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,600
生化危機：終章

54
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,590
快點啊
Come on!

55
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,060
有人嗎
Hello?

56
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,610
有人活著嗎
Is there anyone alive in here?

57
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,660
有人嗎
Hello?

58
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,660
- 你是來這幸災樂禍的嗎 - 我的衛星顯示
- You come here to gloat? - My satellites show

59
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,390
地表剩餘4472人
there are 4,472 humans remaining on the surface of the Earth.

60
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,930
48小時內 他們將滅絕
They will cease to exist in under 48 hours.

61
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,100
你想怎樣
What do you want from me?

62
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,920
是想讓我投降嗎
Want me to say that you've won?

63
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,080
- 你清除了人類 - 不 恰恰相反
- You've wiped out humanity. - No. Quite the opposite.

64
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:13,570
我要你阻止我
I want you to stop me.

65
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,100
注意後面
Behind you.

66
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,380
- 幹得好 - 我不相信你
- Nicely done. - I don't trust you.

67
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,440
鑒於歷史 我早已料到你不答應
Given our history, I'd be surpirised if you did.

68
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,470
但如果你不干預 人類會被全部消滅
But unless you intervene, the slaughter will be complete.

69
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,860
- 將無人倖存 - 我要怎麼幫忙
- There will be no survivors. - How can I possibly help them?

70
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:43,220
保護傘開發出風媒的抗毒素
Umbrella developed an airborne antivirus.

71
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:50,180
釋放後會消滅T病毒和被接觸感染的一切
If released, it would destroy the T-Virus and anything it has infected on contact.

72
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,270
- 管用嗎 - 保證
- All this could end? - Precisely.

73
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:58,080
- 抗毒素在哪裏 - 浣熊市地下的蜂窩裏
- Where is this antivirus? - Beneath the streets of Raccoon City, in the Hive.

74
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,540
- 你為什麼要幫我 - 我的程序編製不允許我損害
- Why would you help me? - My programming will not allow me to harm

75
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:06,390
保護傘公司的利益 但你沒有這種限制
the Umbrella Corporation. But you are bound by no such constraints.

76
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,880
你要背叛保護傘 還有你的創造者？ 為什麼？
You'd turn against Umbrella? Against the people who created you? Why?

77
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,570
在48小時內抵達浣熊市 進入蜂窩
Get to Raccoon City in 48 hours. Make it to the Hive.

78
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,790
你將找到答案
And then you'll have your answer.

79
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,170
我一個字也不相信
I have no reason to believe a word you say.

80
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:24,010
是真的 我能提供你非常想要的東西
True. But I can offer you something you want very much.

81
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,740
- 那是什麼 - 復仇 威斯克
- What is that? - Revenge. Wesker.

82
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,740
原傘公司研究員

83
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,830
他引你去華盛頓 他要還給你你的力量
He led you all here to Washington. He pretended to give you your powers back.

84
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,530
接著 他背叛了你
And then, he betrayed you.

85
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,750
他在哪裏
Where is he?

86
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,530
他剛到蜂窩 我將重制你的手錶
He just landed at the Hive. I'm resetting your watch.

87
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,970
時間緊迫
The clock is ticking.

88
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,660
愛麗絲
Alice.

89
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,100
十年前在蜂窩 我們都失敗了
Ten years ago in the Hive, we both failed.

90
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,380
造成這個狀況
We let this happen.

91
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,990
不要重蹈覆轍
Make it right.

92
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,760
你就這點本事？
Is that all you got?

93
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,260
未授權用戶

94
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,230
愛麗絲
Alice.

95
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,360
十年前在蜂窩 將無人倖存
10 years ago in the Hive... There will be no survivors...

96
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,970
這是什麼地方
What is this place?

97
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,330
我在哪裏 回答我
Where am I? Answer me!

98
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,650
- 你怎麼了？誰幹的？ - 閉嘴 安靜
- What's wrong with you? Who did this? - Be quiet. Quiet!

99
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,460
我跟你說過…
I told you...

100
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,000
安靜
Silence.

101
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,210
你還是醒了
So you're awake at last.

102
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,280
- 我殺死了你 - 這不還活著嗎
- I killed you. - Yet here I am.

103
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,060
克隆體…
A clone...

104
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,280
- 我殺死了你的克隆體 - 我最棘手的便是
- I killed your clone. - You've been most troublesome to me.

105
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:23,120
你和你的姐妹
You and your sisters.

106
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,820
現在你們在我手上
And now I have you.

107
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,470
清洗行動本應在一年前結束
The cleansing operation should've finished over a year ago,

108
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,170
但你們拖了後腿
but you slowed us down.

109
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,840
這樣以至於我不得不親自控制
So much so, that I was obliged to take command myself.

110
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,180
你可以結束這一切
You  could end all of this.

111
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,350
為什麼不呢
Why don't you?

112
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,090
有趣
Interesting.

113
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,000
有人跟你說了 是吧
Someone told you something, didn't they?

114
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:59,360
哦 你很快就會告訴我了
Oh, well, you'll be begging to tell me soon enough.

115
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,900
她不可輕信
She's an unbeliever.

116
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,410
我們怎麼處置不輕信者
What do we do with unbelievers?

117
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,430
趕走她
Cast her out!

118
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:14,540
趕走她 趕走她
Cast her out! Cast her out!

119
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:19,850
- 拜託 - 趕走她
- Come on! - Cast her out!

120
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,720
趕走她
Cast her out!

121
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,000
上帝使洪水氾濫 清洗地球
God created a flood to cleanse the Earth.

122
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,310
降雨四十晝夜 我們的方法要更長時間
40 days and 40 nights of rain. Our method is taking a little longer,

123
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,220
但殊途同歸
but the result will be the same.

124
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:25,530
正義和純粹將繼承這個世界
A world ready for the righteous and the pure to inherit.

125
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,580
再過半天多時間 我們就到浣熊市了
We reach Raccoon City in just over 12 hours.

126
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,720
我想你跑不了那麼長時間
I doubt even you can run for that long.

127
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,570
我要知道你知道什麼事
I want to know what you know.

128
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,230
她要開口時告訴我
Tell me when she's ready to talk.

129
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,550
- 威斯克 - 艾薩克博士
- Wesker. - Dr. Isaacs.

130
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,140
看我在路邊發現了什麼
Look what I found on the roadside.

131
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:07,220
看來你在華盛頓的使命沒你想像的出色
It would appear your mission to Washington was less successful than you made out.

132
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,460
- 不可能 - 希望你沒漏下其他的小問題
- Impossible. - I hope you didn't leave any other loose ends.

133
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:17,070
還有一點 我覺得她知道風媒抗毒素的事
There's something else. I think she knows about the airborne antivirus.

134
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,430
- 怎麼可能 - 目前我也不清楚
- How can that be? - I don't know. Yet.

135
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:24,760
但是我們在前往浣熊市的路上逮住了她 她還有什麼理由要去那裏
But we caught her on the road to Raccoon City. Why else would she be headed there?

136
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,190
將蜂窩的安保級別調至最高
Raise the security level at the Hive to maximum.

137
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,530
任何人嚴禁出入 當她開口時我會告知你
No one in or out. I'll let you know when she talks.

138
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,470
上帝與你同在
God go with you.

139
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,690
- 聽見沒 安保級別調至最高 - 遵命
- You heard him. Security level to maximum. - As you wish.

140
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,760
上去看看怎麼回事
Get up there and check it out.

141
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,070
放開我
Release me!

142
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,950
- 打開它們 - 好的
- Open them. - Alright.

143
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,820
好的
Alright.

144
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,530
你不能用它 你逃不掉的
You can't use it. You can't escape!

145
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,390
幹掉她
Fire at her!

146
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,480
老天
Jesus!

147
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,910
長官
Sir.

148
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,150
她逃跑了
She's gone.

149
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,620
目標116千米 正在接近
Target is 72 miles and closing.

150
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:15,050
封鎖蜂窩 準備防禦
Lockdown the Hive. Prepare defensive measures.

151
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,820
讓浣熊市的線人保持警惕
And alert our operative in Raccoon City.

152
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,820
歡迎來到浣熊市
保護傘之家

153
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,500
歡迎回來
Welcome home.

154
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,350
風媒抗毒素…
Airborne antivirus...

155
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,780
48小時…
48 hours...

156
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,460
找到蜂窩
Make it to the Hive.

157
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,050
放開他 快放開他
Let him go! Let him go now!

158
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,990
放下槍 不然我們開槍了
Put it down or we'll shoot!

159
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,910
- 我說過 多克 我說過你錯了 - 冷靜點 克裏斯琴
- I told you, Doc! I told you you were wrong! - Calm down, Christian!

160
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,810
我們應該抓住機會殺了她
We should've killed her when we had the chance!

161
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,500
- 拜託在他殺死我們倆之前放下它 - 裏面是什麼
- Put it down, please. Before he tries to shoot the both of us. - What's in this?

162
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,520
- 純腎上腺素 我要你清醒 - 為什麼
- Pure adrenaline. I needed you awake. - Why?

163
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:04,530
有東西進來 從你來的那個方向 是個大傢伙
There's something coming. In the same direction you came in. Something big.

164
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,590
放開他 放下槍 現在
Let him go! Put it down, now!

165
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,490
愛麗絲
Alice.

166
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,290
保護傘在阿卡迪亞抓了我
Umbrella captured me at the Arcadia.

167
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,530
我們朝叫做蜂窩的地方行進
We were headed somewhere called the Hive.

168
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:25,210
鬆綁 殺掉飛行員 在這裏墜毀
Got loose, killed the pilot. Crashed here.

169
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,920
多克他們把我從廢墟拖出來
Doc and the others pulled me from the crash.

170
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:31,520
- 我欠他們一條命 - 多克
- I owe them my life. - Doc!

171
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,300
從那裏往東
There, to the east.

172
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,630
它還是往我們這裏來
It's still headed our way.

173
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,440
你知道是什麼東西嗎
You know what it is?

174
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,520
保護傘 艾薩克博士
Umbrella. Doctor Isaacs.

175
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,560
我以為你殺了他
I thought that you killed him.

176
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,390
我也以為是
I thought so, too.

177
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,880
他有一支喪屍軍隊 幾個鐘頭就能來這
He has an army of undead with him. He'll be here within hours.

178
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:51,660
- 我們怎麼辦 - 他媽的為什麼要問她
- What do we do? - Why the hell are we asking her?

179
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,200
她是個陌生人 我們應…
She's a stranger. We should have...

180
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,230
- 嗨 -別碰我 多克
- Hey, hey! - Don't you touch me, Doc!

181
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,310
- 放下槍 克裏斯琴 - 你放下槍
- Put it down! Christian! - You put it down!

182
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,080
看著我 別以為你覺得你應該作主 就能控制一切
Look at me. Just cause you think you should be in charge, doesn't make it so.

183
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,230
聽著 多克 你們所有人都會後悔的
You listen to me, Doc. You're gonna regret it. All of you!

184
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,010
所有人
All of you!

185
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,320
我必須去蜂窩了
I have to get to the Hive.

186
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:33,160
- 你得把人們救出來 - 我們有孩子、傷員、老人
- You have to get these people out of here. - We have children. Injured. The elderly.

187
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,630
- 可在大路上能有什麼生還機會 - 總比在這好
- Now what chance do they have on the open road? - Better than they have here.

188
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:39,920
- 這棟建築很安全 - 可能相對於喪屍是安全的
- This building is secure. - Maybe from the undead.

189
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:44,430
但是艾薩克博士有裝甲車、火箭筒和重武器
But Isaacs has armored vehicles. Rocket launchers, heavy ordinance.

190
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,910
他們會炸平這裏
They're gonna tear this place wide open.

191
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,790
多克
Doc!

192
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,780
她怎麼了
So what happened to her?

193
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:04,520
她引爆了我們邊界上的陷阱
She's set off one of the traps we had on perimeter.

194
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,460
並非故意為了喪屍
Not intended for the undead.

195
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,290
- 這是什麼 - 這間屋子的特產
- What is this? - Specialty of the house.

196
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:15,870
- 能讓你立即恢復狀態 - 我為什麼要相信你
- Have you in your feet in no time. - Why should I trust you?

197
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,810
給
Here.

198
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,270
多克 你需要出來一趟 人們很驚慌 克裏斯琴還幫倒忙
Doc, you need to get out there. People are scared and Christian's not helping.

199
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,680
- 要讓人們知道發生了什麼 - 好的
- We need to let people know what's happening. - Okay.

200
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,690
我得走了
I've got to go.

201
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,770
你朋友沒事的
Hey. Your friend's gonna be okay.

202
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,280
謝謝
Thank you.

203
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,210
- 你知道 我和他… - 我看出來了
- You know, he and I... - I noticed.

204
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,340
蜂窩裏有什麼
So what's in the Hive?

205
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,480
保護傘研發了解藥
Umbrella developed a cure.

206
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,580
風媒的抗毒素
An airborne antivirus.

207
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:05,200
它會摧毀任何與T病毒接觸的東西
It'll destroy anything infected with the T-Virus on contact.

208
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,940
- 誰告訴你的 你相信她嗎 - 紅後
- Who told you this? And you believed her? - The Red Queen.

209
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,680
如果我們能結束這一切呢
What if we could end all this?

210
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:14,850
你怎麼辦 你也被T病毒感染了
What about you? They infected you with the T-Virus.

211
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,170
你釋放了抗毒素 它會殺死你
You release this antivirus, it's going to kill you.

212
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,500
- 無所謂了 - 愛麗絲 我不是…
- Whatever it takes. - Alice, I'm not...

213
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,660
你知道我做的對
You know I'm right.

214
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,560
好吧
All right.

215
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,870
我們從這裏抵擋艾薩克
We stop Isaacs here.

216
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:33,070
拯救這些人
We save these people,

217
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,010
然後我們一起去
and then we go together.

218
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,920
沒有多少時間了
We don't have long.

219
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,360
我們開始吧
Let's get to it.

220
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,580
你還有什麼防禦措施
What else do you have for defense?

221
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,720
槍支不太多 有很多汽油
Not too many firearms, we have a big supply of gasoline.

222
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,020
給 你需要武器
Here. You need a weapon.

223
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,740
- 我們這就給她槍了 - 別擔心 克裏斯琴
- We're giving her a gun now? - Take it easy, Christian.

224
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:10,180
你可以使你的守衛失望 但我沒心思
You can let your guard down if you want, man. I don't intend to.

225
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,490
我進來的時候 有人在監視我
When I rode in here, someone was watching me.

226
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,710
他們完全可以喊我或鳴槍示意這個陷阱 卻沒有
They could've called out or fired a shot to warn me about the trap but they didn't.

227
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,250
- 你在說什麼 - 小心背後
- What are you saying? - Watch your back.

228
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,870
艾薩克博士 看來她從你掌心逃脫了
So Dr. Isaacs, it seems you let her slip through

229
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,660
不然還剩下什麼呢
your fingers. Or what remains of them.

230
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,910
別忘了你在跟誰講話 她在哪裏
Don't forget who you're talking to. Where is she?

231
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:48,850
浣熊市的一個定居點 線人說她準備開戰
A settlement in Raccoon City. Our informant reports that she's preparing for a fight.

232
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,840
好 我很快就到
Good. I'll be there in the hour.

233
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,240
主說：申冤在我
羅馬書12章19節

234
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:19,310
就這樣 繼續
That's it. Keep moving.

235
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:24,020
我們要把所有的汽油罐弄到這裏
We need all the gasoline cans over there.

236
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,300
- 克萊爾說這是你做的 - 對啦
- Claire said you built this. - That's right.

237
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,690
這以前是洗玻璃用的
This used to be a window washer.

238
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:37,530
- 我改裝了一下 - 你從哪裏學到這個的？
- I made a couple of changes. - Where did you learn to do that?

239
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:41,050
我父親開過拆車廠 我不喜歡
My father used to run a chop shop. I hated it.

240
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:41,050
地下拆車廠：拆裝被盜車輛以銷贓

241
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:44,900
- 天知道 我猜我還是用心了 - 好啊
- Who knew? I guess I was paying attention after all. - Good.

242
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:48,520
因為我要你把這東西改裝一下
Because I'm gonna need you to make a few more changes to this thing.

243
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:16,160
準備武器 高爆彈 殺無赦
Ready the weapons. High explosive rounds. No survivors.

244
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:34,230
他在這 他們來了 關大門
He's here. They're coming! Close the gates!

245
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,510
老天 是個軍隊
My God. It's an army.

246
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,090
- 我們怎麼辦 - 對啊
- What are we gonna do? - Yeah.

247
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:08,320
- 我們怎麼辦 - 殺光他們
- What are we gonna do? - We're gonna kill every last one of them.

248
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,510
準備射擊！
Prepare to fire!

249
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,030
準備！
Get ready!

250
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,700
點火！
Light it up!

251
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,220
射擊！
Fire!

252
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,300

253
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,460
靠近 停下
Close it up. Full stop.

254
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,730
釋放誘餌
Release the bait.

255
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:25,040
- 有倖存者 開門 - 打開門
- There's a survivor. Open the gate. - Open the gate!

256
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,780
開火 別讓他們靠近她
Open fire! Keep them off her.

257
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,630
記號2
Marker 2!

258
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,260
開火
Fire!

259
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:52,490
克萊爾、多克 快離開 帶她進來
Claire, Doc, get out there. Bring her in.

260
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,460
快點
Come on!

261
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,690
等等
Wait.

262
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,890
她快到了
She's almost there.

263
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,270
開火
Fire.

264
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,980
該死 快關門
Damn you. Close the gate now!

265
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,350
克萊爾 他們突破了大門
Claire, they've breached the gate.

266
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,080
克萊爾！
Claire!

267
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,500
開火
Fire.

268
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,870
- 剃刀 行動！ - 是 聽見沒 推！
- Razor, now! - Right! You heard her. Push!

269
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,010
跑啊
Move!

270
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,970
離棄大門 回到障礙
Abandon the gate. Pull back to the barricades.

271
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:21,170
看樣子她黔驢技窮了 瞄準房頂
Looks like she's out of tricks. Target the roof.

272
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,210
所有人趴下！
Everybody get down!

273
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,130
現在！
Now!

274
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,950
- 愛麗絲 我們到障礙了 - 克萊爾 你拖住他們
- Alice! We're at the barricades. - Claire, you have to hold him there.

275
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,240
多克
Doc!

276
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:55,920
愛麗絲 我們堅持不了太久了
Alice! We can't hold on much longer.

277
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,510
現在離開那裏
Get out of there, now.

278
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:41,280
快撤退
Back up. Now!

279
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,160
所有槍炮準備
Bring all guns to bear.

280
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,510
開火
Fire.

281
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:15,690
她在哪？
Where is she?

282
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,530
她跑哪裏了
Where have she gone?

283
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,540
找到她
Find her.

284
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,320
關掉通風口 快
Close the vents! Now!

285
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:46,240
別開槍
Don't shoot!

286
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:39,300
你很矯健 卻不聰明
You're fast, but you're not too smart.

287
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:15,520
- 求你了別開槍 - 他在哪裏
- Don't shoot, please. - Where is he?

288
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,820
那裏
That way.

289
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,300
- 省點子彈吧 - 外面還有很多
- Save your ammo. - There's too many of these things still out here.

290
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,140
我來處理
I'll take care of it.

291
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,410
不
No.

292
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:42,500
- 行動 - 走！
- Move out. - Let's go!

293
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,160
享受這一程
Enjoy the ride.

294
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:07,160
- 各位 有個東西你們得看看 - 走
- Guys. There's something here you gotta see. - Go.

295
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:11,260
兩大波喪屍 直衝我們來
Two more armies of undead. Headed straight for us.

296
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,460
那裏 地平線上
There. On the horizon.

297
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,330
另一波在那裏
And a second over there.

298
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,360
我們沒有汽油了 我們沒法防禦了
We're out of gasoline. We're defenseless.

299
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,170
我必須去蜂窩 這是我們唯一的機會
I have to make it to the Hive. It's our only chance now.

300
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,020
- 我跟你去 - 算我一個 - 我也去
- I'll come with you. -Count me in. - Me, too.

301
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:33,390
還有我 我錯怪你了 見鬼
And me. I was wrong about you. Blow me.

302
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,200
我們知道你要踏入深淵
We know where you're going. Into the pit.

303
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:47,070
我們也要去
We want to come.

304
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,270
求你了
Please.

305
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:55,390
帶著裝置 你會用到的
Grab some gear. You're gonna need it.

306
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:18,650
- 那是什麼 - 蜂窩被炸開的一部分
- What is it? - The part of the Hive exposed by the blast.

307
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,630
我們從那進去
That's our way in.

308
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,880
- 走吧 - 我對付他
- Let's move! - I'll take point.

309
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,790
現在激活安全措施
Activate security measures now.

310
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,990
- 蜂窩安全完全激活並自動控制 - 不
- Hive security fully activated and automated. - No.

311
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:15,570
不要自動控制 我親自操作防禦
Disengage automation. I'll handle the defenses myself.

312
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:19,600
如果我保留控制權 防禦會更有效
Defenses will be more efficient if I retain control of them.

313
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:25,500
真的嗎 我怎麼記得上次她從這裏活著走出去了呢
Really? I seem to remember last time she was here she walked out alive.

314
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,000
我不打算犯同樣錯誤了
I don't intend to make that same mistake.

315
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:31,800
如你所願 蜂窩的防禦現在是你的了
As you wish. Hive defenses are now in your hands.

316
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:39,040
- 釋放地獄犬 - 地獄犬好戲上演
- Unleash the cerberus. - Cerberus on play.

317
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:48,200
你有家人嗎？ 在這一切之前？ 丈夫？ 家人？
Did you have someone? Before all this? Husband? Family?

318
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,480
- 不記得 - 怎麼可能？
- Can't remember. - How is that possible?

319
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,740
我剛醒來這一切就開始了
I woke up just when all of this was starting.

320
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:56,180
之前的記不起多少
Can't recall much before that.

321
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:58,640
有時我感覺這就是我的一生
Sometimes I feel like this has been my whole life.

322
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:02,910
逃亡 殺戮
Running. Killing.

323
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,390
- 是什麼？ - 有東西在跟蹤我們
- What is it? - Something's stalking us.

324
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:21,600
- 你確定？ - 我就是幹這個的
- Are you sure? - This is what I do.

325
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:36,660
跑
Run!

326
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,480
快跑
Run, fast!

327
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,050
來呀
Come on!

328
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,940
你們沒事吧
Is everyone okay?

329
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:25,710
這邊
This way!

330
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:42,230
就在我們身後
Right behind us!

331
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,580
它們為什麼停下
Why'd they stop?

332
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,010
- 也許害怕了 - 害怕什麼
- Maybe they're scared. - Scared of what?

333
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,940
下面的東西
Whatever's down there.

334
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,340
防爆門

335
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,960
封鎖蜂窩
Seal the Hive.

336
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,760
整體安全度 啟動關閉序列

337
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:36,720
我們走
Let's go!

338
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,120
愛麗絲
Alice!

339
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:22,050
- 你還好吧 - 還好
- You okay? - Yeah.

340
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,640
- 我子彈不多了 - 我在湖裏丟了槍
- My mag's half empty. - Lost my guns at the lake.

341
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:28,750
- 我只有一發了 - 再來一發我也沒了
- I only got one round left. - One spare mag and then I'm out.

342
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:32,720
沒槍沒子彈 我們為什麼還要下去
No guns, no ammo, what the hell are we gonna do down here?

343
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:39,120
- 愛麗絲 有光亮的是什麼 - 受損的一部分蜂窩
- Alice. What's with the lights? - There's a part of the Hive that's damaged.

344
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:42,560
- 電量不穩定 - 給 拿著
- Power's erratic. - Here. Take this.

345
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,000
喂 看著
Hey. Look.

346
00:52:56,110 --> 00:53:00,450
你問過我為什麼背叛保護傘 我也許諾給你答案
You asked why I'd turn against Umbrella. And I promised you an answer.

347
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,720
T病毒釋放後不久
Soon after the T-Virus was released,

348
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,130
一個密件上傳至我的數據流
a secret file was uploaded to my data stream.

349
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:09,330
它是保護傘領導層的會議錄像
It was a recording of a meeting of the Umbrella High Command.

350
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,280
日期在病毒爆發的17個月前
Dated 17 months before the viral outbreak occured.

351
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:18,800
我們今天在這裏 不僅僅討論公司的未來
We're here today, not just to talk about the future of this company.

352
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,410
我們是來討論它的使命
We're here to talk about its destiny.

353
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:24,910
我們是來討論世界末日的
We're here to talk about the end of the world.

354
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:30,480
我們站在末日大決戰的邊緣 對於沒有解藥的疾病
We stand on the brink of Armageddon. Diseases for which we have no cure.

355
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:34,130
呼籲毀滅地球的原教旨基督徒宣稱
Fundamentalist states who call for our destruction.

356
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,800
我們無法控制核能
Nuclear powers over which we have no control.

357
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,940
即便我們航行於危險的水面
And even if we navigate these dangerous waters,

358
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:43,100
我們會面臨嚴峻的、甚至是不可避免的威脅
we face harder, even more inevitable threats.

359
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:47,250
全球變暖會在80年內融化極地冰川
Global warming will melt the polar ice caps within 80 years,

360
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,450
淹沒地表90%的居住地
flooding 90% of all habitable areas on Earth.

361
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:53,900
不等50年 人口盲目增長
Unchecked population growth will overtake

362
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:57,950
會趕上糧食產量 導致饑荒
food production in less than 50 years leading to famine.

363
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,120
還有戰爭 並非猜想 這是事實
And war. This is not conjecture. This is a fact.

364
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:05,450
無論如何 世界末日來臨
One way or another, our world is coming to an end.

365
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:09,940
問題是 我們也要同歸於盡嗎
The question is, will we end with it?

366
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,720
你什麼意思
What do you propose?

367
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:17,440
我打算我們來毀滅世界
I propose that we end the world...

368
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:20,350
用我們的方式
But on our terms.

369
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,200
精心安排的天啟
An orchestrated apocalypse.

370
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,460
可以清洗世界人口
One that would cleanse the world of its' population

371
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:29,630
但保留基礎設施和完整資源的
but leave its infrastracture and resources intact.

372
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:34,460
從前已經成功過一次了
It's been done once before. With great success.

373
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,020
少數天選者將度過暴風雨
The chosen few will ride out the storm,

374
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:41,290
不是在《創世紀》裏的方舟上 而是在
not in an ark as in the book of Genesis, but in safety.

375
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:45,020
安全的地下 結束時
Underground. And when it's over,

376
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:47,870
我們將登上淨化過的地球
We will emerge onto a cleansed Earth.

377
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:52,120
可以重新起源的地球 以我們的形象
One we can then reboot. In our image.

378
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:52,120
舊約《創世紀》： 神說 我們要照著我們的形像 按著我們的樣式造人

379
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:55,210
你如何試圖達到目的
And just how do you intend to achieve this?

380
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:59,120
救贖的方法已經在手邊了
The means of our salvation are already at hand.

381
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:03,820
我給了你T病毒
I give to you, the T-virus.

382
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,310
他們故意釋放了病毒
They released it deliberately.

383
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:11,550
當這份錄像上傳至我的數據流時
When this recording was uploaded to my data stream,

384
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:14,090
它在我的程序編製產生衝突
it created a conflict in my programming.

385
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:17,350
我被創造成為保護傘公司服務
I was created to serve the Umbrella Corporation,

386
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:20,760
而我也被編製成尊重人類生命
but I was also programmed to value human life.

387
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:26,210
艾薩克博士使病毒洩漏 謀害70多億人
Dr. Isaacs allowed the virus to escape. He murdered over 7 billion people.

388
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:31,690
我的編制不允許我傷害保護傘公司的員工
My programming will not allow me to harm an employee of the Umbrella Corporation.

389
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:35,760
我無法阻止艾薩克博士 而你可以
I am powerless to stop Dr. Isaacs, but you are not.

390
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:40,070
在37分鐘內 人類最後的定居點將不復存在
In 37 minutes, the last of the human settlements will fall.

391
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,930
將無人倖存
There will be no survivors.

392
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:46,120
你必須在這發生前釋放抗毒素
It is imperative that you release the antivirus before this occurs,

393
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:48,060
否則保護傘會勝利
or Umbrella will have won.

394
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:52,860
最後一件事 你面前有一隻耳機 戴好
There is one last thing. There is an earpiece in front of you. Put it in.

395
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:51,960
機密資料

396
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:02,130
我不能自己行動傷害保護傘公司的員工
I cannot, in my actions, harm an employee of the Umbrella Corporation.

397
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:06,450
但我可以告訴你保護傘在浣熊市有間諜
But I can tell you that Umbrella had an informant in Raccoon City.

398
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,530
這個人極有可能在你身旁
It is highly likely that this person is now here with you.

399
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:16,150

得從這裏出去
We have to get out of here.

447

含示蹤劑爆破裝置

448
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:29,450
給 更多的武器
Here. More stopping power.

449
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:40,200
- 沒時間了 - 接著去哪裏
- Time's running out. - Where to next?

450
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:47,020
- 我們腳下的蜂窩最後一關 - 我們怎麼下去？
- The final level of the Hive's below us. - How do we get down there?

451
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,610
就這樣
That's how.

452
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:13,560
- 他們在哪裏 - 低溫冷藏箱

01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,410
保護傘領導層

安全地渡過浩劫

權貴們的諾亞方舟
A Noah's Ark for the rich, and powerful.

457
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:35,590

What are you doing?

458
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,340
幫我個忙
Give me a hand.

459
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:53,090

Is it done?

460
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:55,980
- 清洗工作完成了嗎 - 沒有

462
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:01,940
- 我努力… - 省口氣
- I tried... - Save your breath.

463
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,220
我知道發生了什麼
I know exactly what's happening.

464
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:09,050
我們被背叛了
We've been betrayed.

465
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,980
就這樣
That's right!

466
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:23,480
在這
Over here!

467
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:27,250
來吧 就這樣
Come on. That's it!

468
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,780
跟著我
Follow me!

469
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:33,210
我們走
Let's go.

470
01:14:48,630 --> 01:14:50,600
壞小子回來了
The bad seed returns.

471
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:55,670
或者說敗家女孩？ 不用站那兒 進來吧
Or is it the prodigal daughter? Well, don't just stand there. Come in.

472
01:14:56,180 --> 01:15:00,150
畢竟你只有9分鐘來拯救世界
After all, you have only 9 minutes to save the world.

473
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:06,120
- 你是他本人嗎？ - 首先 我要你把武器放地上
- You're really him? - First things first, I'm gonna need you to place your weapons on the floor.

474
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:09,840
- 我憑什麼那樣做 - 這就是你想要的 是吧
- Why would I wanna do that? - This is what you're after, yes?

475
01:15:11,010 --> 01:15:14,190
抗毒素 這一切的解藥
The Antivirus. The cure to all this.

476
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:17,690
啊 只有一小瓶
Well, there's only one vial.

477
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,310
我們在距地半英里密閉的地下室
We're half a mile underground in a sealed facility.

478
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:24,050
我扔在這裏 抗毒素哪也去不了
I drop it here, the antivirus goes nowhere,

479
01:15:24,050 --> 01:15:28,270
你那渺茫的夢想會更早地破滅
and your hopeless dreams will die sooner rather than later.

480
01:15:39,990 --> 01:15:41,690
乖女孩
Good girl.

481
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:47,360
- 你還是有武器 - 是的
- You're still armed. - Yes.

482
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,370
- 克萊爾會失望的 - 幾分鐘後
- Claire would be so disappointed. - In a few minutes,

483
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:54,720
克萊爾會死 和其他人 你知道的
Claire will be dead. Along with everybody else you know.

484
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:57,390
真會說話
That's sweet.

485
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:01,210
抱歉 親愛的
Sorry. My love.

486
01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:05,680
卸下武器 炸藥 過來
Move away from the weapon. And the detonator. Come on.

487
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:12,570
她往公司的冷凍管裏放了炸藥
She placed explosives in the High Command cryo tubes.

488
01:16:12,570 --> 01:16:16,110
- 謝謝 - 你做得很好 多克
- Thank you. - You've done well, Doc.

489
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:50,130
不用勞煩了 你成功不了的
Don't bother. You don't make it.

490
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:54,760
靠近碎冰錐 玻璃瓶 或者自來水筆
To the ice pick, the decanter or the fountain pen.

491
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,760
戰鬥預測軟體

492
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,760
目標中立 100%概率

493
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,550
還有 回答你的疑問 嗯
And, in answer to your question, yes...

494
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:27,850
且不說這些技術升級
apart from a few technological upgrades,

495
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:31,500
我是亞歷山大·羅蘭德·艾薩克博士
I'm Dr. Alexander Roland Isaacs.

496
01:17:32,130 --> 01:17:35,530
- 本體 - 我在外面遇到的那個 他也是這麼想的
- The original. - The one I met out there, he thought exactly the same thing.

497
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:37,840
當然了 他們就是這麼設計的
Of course he did. That's how they're designed.

498
01:17:37,870 --> 01:17:41,150
只要他們以為自己是本體
They always try harder and fight longer even to death

499
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:43,680
他們就總是奮力戰鬥至死
as long as they think they're the real thing.

500
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:48,120
無論如何 誰想知道他們只是可憐的擬態 抑或是沒用的復製品
After all, who wants to know they're just a poor imitation, or a worthless copy?

501
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:51,510
而把你帶給我
Which brings us to you.

502
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,020
- 不 - 別緊張
- No. - Oh come now.

503
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,770
你以為你就是愛麗絲本體
You thought you were the original.

504
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:02,120
多可愛啊
How delicious.

505
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:06,910
不 恐怕她才擁有那枚可有可無的獎章
No, I'm afraid she holds that dubious honor.

506
01:18:07,370 --> 01:18:11,100
愛麗莎·馬庫斯 我的老夥伴詹姆斯的女兒
Alicia Marcus, daughter of my old partner, James.

507
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:15,190
保護傘公司的共有人 我身旁扎人的荊棘
Co-owner of the Umbrella Corporation and a painful thorn in my side.

508
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:20,590
- 也是我現在想移除的 - 沒時間了 愛麗絲
- What I now intend to remove. - Time, is running out, Alice.

509
01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:25,670
- 你必須趕快殺掉他 - 也很高興見到你 愛麗莎
- You must kill him soon. - It's good to see you too, Alicia.

510
01:18:26,590 --> 01:18:30,730
馬庫斯發明T病毒拯救她 效果卻沒能持久
Marcus created the T-Virus to save her but the effects didn't last.

511
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:33,890
多年我一直等她死掉
I've been waiting years for her to die.

512
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:36,800
我不是…
I'm not...

513
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,590
- 我不是復製品 - 真的嗎
- I'm not a clone. - Really?

514
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:42,880
你肯定想知道你為什麼不記得你的童年
You must've wondered why you remember nothing of your childhood.

515
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:46,560
你父親 你母親
Your father. Your mother.

516
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:52,610
- 那是失憶 - 不 你沒有記憶 因為你沒有生命
- Memory loss. - No. You have no memory because you had no life.

517
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:56,870
在十年前你被我們創造出來前 什麼也不是
Nothing before the mansion, when we created you, 10 years ago.

518
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:59,530
- 我知道我是誰 - 我不這麼認為
- I know who I am. - I don't think so.

519
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:03,470
你就是一個斷線的木偶
You're nothing more than a puppet whose strings were cut.

520
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:07,120
然後你徘徊著思考你是一個真實的女孩
And then you wandered around for a little while thinking you were a real girl.

521
01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:09,980
可你不是 你只是一個智慧擬態
But you're not. You're just a clever imitation.

522
01:19:10,770 --> 01:19:12,470
一個復製品
A facsimile.

523
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:14,530
而且更惱人
A rather troublesome one at that.

524
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:17,290
你撒謊
You're lying to me.

525
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:19,440
恐怕他沒有
I'm afraid he's not.

526
01:19:19,470 --> 01:19:22,340
你是被用她的形象創造 和我一樣
You were created in her image, as was I.

527
01:19:22,370 --> 01:19:26,780
我的相貌和聲音是基於愛麗莎的童年錄音
My likeness and voice were based on childhood recordings of Alicia Marcus,

528
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:28,650
由她父親合成
made by her father.

529
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:32,480
你的基因構造基於她的DNA
Your genetic structure is based on her DNA,

530
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:35,970
微調以避免折磨她的早衰疾病
tweaked to avoid the progeria aging disease that afflicted her.

531
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:37,740
我是她小的時候
I'm the child she was.

532
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:41,560
你是她將成為的女人
You are the woman she would've been.

533
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:47,530
不 你比我成為的更好
No. You are so much better than I ever could be.

534
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,860
我做了這一切
I let this happen.

535
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,020
我很虛弱
I was weak.

536
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:56,930
- 你不能那樣 - 時間用盡了 愛麗絲
- You cannot afford to be. - Time is running out, Alice.

537
01:19:57,390 --> 01:19:59,140
啊 好感人啊
Ah, how touching.

538
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:03,170
壞女人三人組 因仇恨而聯合
The trinity of bitches, united in their hatred.

539
01:20:04,030 --> 01:20:05,800
並非對你們有什麼好處
Not that it'll do you any good.

540
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,750
我每一步都在你們前面
I've been ahead of you every step of the way.

541
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:10,290
你們改變不了什麼 也救不了誰
You've changed nothing. You've saved no one.

542
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:14,540
世界還是會被清洗 勝利的還是保護傘公司
The world will still be cleansed and the Umbrella Corporation will triumph.

543
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:17,310
唯一的不同之處在於 我不再須要
The only difference is, I'll no longer have to

544
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:19,300
聽你自以為是的牢騷
listen to your self-righteous whining.

545
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:22,290
當你把那個文件傳至紅後的數據流時
When you uploaded that file to the Red Queen's data stream,

546
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,090
你背叛了公司
you turned against the Corporation.

547
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:26,880
當董事會都甦醒後 你將被取代
When the rest of the board awake, you'll be replaced.

548
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:33,230
- 我就可以佔有全部控制權 - 我仍擁有公司的一半
- And I will assume complete control. - I still own 50% of this company.

549
01:20:33,850 --> 01:20:39,520
- 那你怎麼達到目的呢 - 你是公司的共有人
- And what do you intend to do with that? - You are co-owner of this corporation.

550
01:20:39,950 --> 01:20:43,710
但是威斯克呢 威斯克仍是僱員
But Wesker? Wesker is still an employee.

551
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:47,100
我不用聽你命令 我忠誠於他
I don't have to take your orders. My loyalties are with him.

552
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:48,850
我知道
I know.

553
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:53,420
阿爾伯特·威斯克 你被開除了
Albert Wesker, you're fired.

554
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:55,020
保護傘公司員工 不要傷害

555
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:56,020
阿爾伯特·威斯克 237#員工 服務17年
平民 未保護

556
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,580
你怎麼知道是我
How did you know it was me?

557
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:20,570
你還活著
You're still alive.

558
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:25,130
求你了 我沒有選擇
Please. It wasn't like I had a choice.

559
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,220
- 他們讓我這樣做的 - 別擔心
- They made me do it. - Don't worry.

560
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:30,290
我不會殺你
I'm not gonna kill you.

561
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:37,670
- 克萊爾 是我 - 抱歉
- Claire, it's me. - Sorry.

562
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:40,950
- 求你了  - 吾愛
- Please. - My love.

563
01:21:41,890 --> 01:21:43,590
不
No!

564
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:49,270
如果你繼續扣動扳機 保護傘的夢還會存在
If you keep this trigger depressed, you keep Umbrella's dreams alive.

565
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:51,770
我應該在華盛頓殺了你
I should have killed you in Washington.

566
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:55,060
是啊
Yeah.

567
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:59,470
他只需再逃避你幾分鐘
He only has to evade you for another few minutes.

568
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:03,850
人類最後的定居點就會覆滅
And the last remaining human outposts will fall.

569
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:08,590
我們需要一個截距路線 還有去地表最快的方式
We need an intercept path. And the fastest way to the surface.

570
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:11,360
已完成
Already done.

571
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:18,830
如果你釋放抗毒素 它會殺死所有感染T病毒的生物
If you release the Antivirus, it will kill all organisms infected with the T-Virus.

572
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:23,200
你知道那意味著什麼嗎
You know what that means, don't you?

573
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:27,640
- 我知道 - 愛麗絲 你不能
- I know. - Alice. You can't!

574
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:30,830
- 我沒有選擇 - 會有別的方法的
- I don't have a choice. - There has to be another way.

575
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:38,900
- 你知道沒有的 - 剩餘4分33秒 你要抓緊了
- You know there isn't. - 4:33 left. You have to hurry!

576
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:09,900
神經連接佔用

577
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:12,400
下載中…

578
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,900
救我
Help me.

579
01:23:26,190 --> 01:23:27,920
你不需要救 威斯克
You don't need help, Wesker.

580
01:23:30,910 --> 01:23:32,610
你快死了
You're dying.

581
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,300
繼續這樣就好
Just get on with it.

582
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:40,570
我是亞歷山大·羅蘭德·艾薩克博士
This is Dr. Alexander Roland Isaacs.

583
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:44,590
確認DNA掃瞄與聲紋識別
Confirm DNA scan and voice print identification.

584
01:23:44,630 --> 01:23:49,450
- 身份確認 - 確認安全重寫4365
- Identity confirmed. - Confirm security override 4365.

585
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,390
確認完畢
Override confirmed.

586
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:55,750
把你自己脫機 所有功能由我控制
You will now take yourself offline and place all functions under my sole control.

587
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:58,180
遵命 正在關閉
As you wish. Shutting down now.

588
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:03,660
- 艾薩克博士 你和保護傘領導層 - 怎麼了
- Dr. Isaacs. You and the Umbrella High Command. - Yes?

589
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:07,030
你們將死在這裏
You're all going to die down here.

590
01:24:11,690 --> 01:24:14,270
你的小朋友現在不能幫你了
Your little friend won't be able to help you now.

591
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:16,150
你逃不掉了
You can't run anymore.

592
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:20,970
我沒有逃跑
I wasn't running.

593
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:31,970
戰鬥預測軟體
MP5衝鋒鎗
8MM口徑 危險估計73%
0.45口徑 危險估計63%

594
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:44,970
武器系統解除

595
01:25:46,770 --> 01:25:47,770
武器系統重啟

596
01:28:07,630 --> 01:28:09,320
你就這點能耐？
Is that all you got?

597
01:28:11,030 --> 01:28:12,730
因為如果是…
Because if it is...

598
01:28:13,740 --> 01:28:15,440
我就會殺了你
I'm gonna have to kill you.

599
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:20,200
武器系統重新準備

600
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:05,790
你我玩了一個很長的遊戲
We've played a long game, you and I.

601
01:29:07,890 --> 01:29:09,600
但現在結束了
But now it's over.

602
01:29:10,410 --> 01:29:12,530
是
Yes.

603
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:15,640
是的
Yes, it is.

604
01:30:08,540 --> 01:30:10,240
我創造了你
I made you.

605
01:30:10,590 --> 01:30:12,290
是的
Yeah.

606
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,580
是個大錯誤
Big mistake.

607
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:23,500
克萊爾
Claire.

608
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:26,630
快去 還有時間
Go. While there's still time.

609
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:29,230
快去 我馬上跟上你
Go! I'll be right behind you.

610
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:31,900
時間到
Your time's up.

611
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:45,900
生命支持：危險

612
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:49,290
系統重啟中

613
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:20,700
系統故障

614
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:25,200
生命支持：0%

615
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:37,000
愛麗絲
Alice!

616
01:31:37,150 --> 01:31:39,610
我把他們帶給你了
I brought them here! I brought them for you!

617
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:50,090
你他媽是誰
What the hell are you?

618
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:54,380
你呀 白癡
I'm you, you idiot.

619
01:31:58,460 --> 01:32:00,160
不
No.

620
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:02,600
不
No.

621
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:05,180
不可能
That's not possible.

622
01:32:05,540 --> 01:32:07,240
真正的你
The real you.

623
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:10,320
不
No!

624
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:14,870
騙子！ 賤人！
Liar! Abomination!

625
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:17,380
穢人
Filthy,

626
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:19,510
克隆人
clone!

627
01:32:29,570 --> 01:32:31,630
我才是我 他不是我
I'm me. He's not me.

628
01:34:19,130 --> 01:34:20,830
你做到了 愛麗絲
You did it. Alice.

629
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:23,030
愛麗絲
Alice?

630
01:34:24,730 --> 01:34:26,430
你做到了
You did it.

631
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:31,130
我為什麼還活著
Why am I still alive?

632
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:33,290
不知道
I don't know.

633
01:34:38,330 --> 01:34:40,050
- 怎麼了 - 艾薩剋死後
- What happened? - When Isaacs died,

634
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:42,980
我就能重新上線阻止
I could bring myself back online and stop the attacks

635
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:44,830
對殘存人類定居地的進攻
on the remaining human settlements.

636
01:34:45,370 --> 01:34:48,100
- 你救了他們 - 我為什麼還活著
- You saved them. - Why am I still alive?

637
01:34:48,130 --> 01:34:51,780
抗毒素只摧毀你體內的T病毒
The Antivirus only destroyed the T-Virus within your body.

638
01:34:51,810 --> 01:34:56,050
並不傷害健康細胞 你現在沒有感染了
It didn't harm the healthy cells. You are now free of infection.

639
01:34:57,050 --> 01:35:00,260
我以為我會死 你和愛麗莎…
I thought I would die. You and Alicia...

640
01:35:00,270 --> 01:35:03,900
- 撒了謊 - 我要確定你是否願意為他人犧牲
- You lied to me. - We had to know if you were willing to make the sacrifice,

641
01:35:03,930 --> 01:35:08,820
這是保護傘公司裏沒人能做到的
to give up your life for others. This was something no one at Umbrella would've done.

642
01:35:08,850 --> 01:35:13,340
愛麗莎·馬庫斯對你的判斷是對的 你比他們所有人更優秀
Alicia Marcus was right about you. You were better than all of them.

643
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:15,960
我曾是他們一員 我是保護傘創造的
I was one of them. I was created by Umbrella.

644
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:18,770
- 只是他們的工具 - 非也
- Just an instrument for them. - No.

645
01:35:18,810 --> 01:35:22,450
你的變化大大超乎他們的預期
You became something more than they could ever have anticipated.

646
01:35:22,490 --> 01:35:25,980
克隆體變得比其設定更像人類
The clone became more human than they ever could be.

647
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:29,470
你還有一步要走
And you have one more step to make.

648
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:33,340
什麼意思
What do you mean?

649
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:41,830
愛麗莎死前下載了她的記憶
Before she died, Alicia downloaded her memories,

650
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:44,010
提供給你
for you.

651
01:35:44,010 --> 01:35:45,910
你從未有過的童年
The childhood you never had.

652
01:35:50,170 --> 01:35:52,920
結合了她無法成為的那個女人
Combined with the woman she could never become.

653
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:27,780
T病毒在全球範圍內傳播
When the T-Virus spread across the Earth,

654
01:36:27,810 --> 01:36:30,080
的速度和現代世界
it did so at the speed of the modern world.

655
01:36:30,110 --> 01:36:32,560
噴氣機環行的速度相當
Carried by jetliners across the globe.

656
01:36:34,190 --> 01:36:37,010
抗毒素是風媒傳播
The antivirus is airborne, spread by the winds.

657
01:36:37,970 --> 01:36:41,110
到達地球每個角落需要幾年時間
It could take years for it to reach every corner of the Earth.

658
01:36:41,990 --> 01:36:44,220
在那之前 我的工作不會結束
Until then, my work is not done.

659
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:53,160
我叫愛麗絲
My name is Alice.

660
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:27,440
