那個法事只會讓你懊悔
That ritual will bring you only sorrow.

21
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,120
虛偽
Hypocrite!

22
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,350
挑戰關卡  比利
Challenge round, Billy.

23
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,580
拜托  比利  開玩笑呢
Come on, Billy. You've got to be messing with me.

24
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,670
沒有  醫生
No, doctor.

《如此美好》  恰克·曼吉歐尼  1977年
Feels So Good, Chuck Mangione, 1977.

26
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,110
真是的  比利  你還說這個會很難呢
Honestly, Billy, you said this one would be hard.

27
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,080
-是1978年  -不  比利
- It's 1978. - No, Billy,

28
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,410
《如此美好》雖然是1978年登上榜單的
while Feels So Good may have charted in 1978,

29
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,210
但專輯是1977年12月發行的
the album was released in December, 1977.

30
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,790
-不  維基上說是197...  -再看看
- No, no. Wikipedia says it's a 19... - Check again.

31
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,270
這些無用的信息你都儲存在哪啊
Where do you store all this useless information?

32
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,700
無用  他單靠粗管短號就能上前十熱曲榜
Useless? The man charted a top ten hit with a Flugelhorn.

33
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,490
-怎么樣  比利  -1977年
- Status, Billy? - 1977.

34
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,230
拜托  我恨你
Please. I hate you.

35
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,700
"如此美好"  是吧
"Feels so good", doesn't it?

36
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,010
我來吧  斯蒂芬
I... I've got this, Stephen.

37
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,210
你該做的做完了  去吧  我們來縫合
You've done your bit. Go ahead, we'll close up.

38
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,400
-怎么了  -槍傷
- What is it? - GSW.

39
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,430
你居然還能保住他的命
It's amazing you kept him alive.

40
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,910
呼吸暫停  腦干測試
Apneic, failed the brain stem test...

41
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,280
和呼吸暫停反射測試均無反應
and the apnea reflex test.

42
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,910
我好像發現問題所在了  帕爾默醫生
I think I found the problem, Dr. Palmer.

43
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,340
你把一顆子彈留在了他的腦子里
You left a bullet in his head.

44
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,180
謝謝  它撞到了髓質
Thanks. It's impinging on the medulla.

45
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,860
我需要專家意見  尼克已經判了腦死亡
I needed a specialist. Nic diagnose brain death.

46
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,950
但我就是覺得不對勁
Something about that doesn't feel right to me.

47
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,900
我們得跑了
We have to run.

48
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,480
韋斯特醫生  你在做什么
Dr. West! What are you doing?

49
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,340
器官采集  他是捐獻者
Organ harvest. He's a donor.

50
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,990
別急  我可沒同意
Slow down. I did not agree to that.

51
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,180
我不需要你同意  我們已經判定腦死亡了
I don't need you to. We've already called brain death.

52
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:22,850
話說早了
Prematurely.

53
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,710
得為他準備進行枕下開顱手術
We need to get him prepped for sub-occipital craniotomy.

54
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,390
我不會讓你給死人開刀的
Not gonna let you operate on a dead man.

55
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,260
你看到了什么
What do you see?

56
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,150
-一顆子彈  -一顆完好的子彈
- A bullet? - A perfect bullet.

57
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,940
子彈加固過
It's been hardened.

58
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,070
子彈加固是用鉛銻合金
You harden a bullet by alloying lead with antimony.

59
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,260
有毒金屬
A toxic metal.

60
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,030
而且子彈直接接觸腦脊液
And that's leeched directly into the cerebral spinal fluid.

61
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,090
立刻造成中樞神經系統停擺
Rapid-onset central nervous system shutdown.

62
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,680
我們得走了
We got to go.

63
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,850
病人沒死  但他要死了
The patient's not dead, but he's dying.

64
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,510
還要采集他的器官嗎
Still want to harvest his organs?

65
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,570
我來協助你
I'll assist you.

66
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,190
不用  帕爾默醫生會協助我的
No! Dr. Palmer will assist me.

67
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,440
謝謝
Thank you.

68
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,140
影像引導  立刻
Image guidance, stat.

69
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,910
沒那個時間了
We don't have time for that.

70
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,970
你不能直接用手做
You can't do it freehand.

71
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:17,910
我能  我就要這么做
I can and I will.

72
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,290
這不是炫耀的時候  斯特蘭奇
This isn't a time for showing off, Strange.

73
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,270
那十分鐘前
How about ten minutes ago,

74
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,200
你錯判了死亡時間時呢
when you called the wrong time of death?

75
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,250
顱神經未受損
Cranial nerves intact.

76
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,510
韋斯特醫生  蓋住你的表
Dr. West, cover your watch.

77
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,250
你沒必要當著眾人的面羞辱他的
You know, you didn't have to humiliate him in front of everyone.

78
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,330
我還沒必要救他的病人呢  但是嘛...
I didn't have to save his patient, either. But, you know, I

79
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,620
我有時候就是忍不住
sometimes just can't help myself.

80
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,110
-尼克是個好醫生  -你來找我了
- Nic is a great doctor. - You came to me.

81
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,690
我想聽聽別人的意見
Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion.

82
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,910
你已經聽到了
You had a second opinion.

83
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,470
你想聽到好的意見
What you needed was a competent one.

84
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,970
所以你更該當我的待命神經外科醫生了
Well, all the more reason why you should be my neurosurgeon on call.

85
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,290
你可以做出很大貢獻
You could make such a difference.

86
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,270
我不能在你的屠宰場工作
I can't work in your butcher shop.

87
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,080
我在做截斷脊髓熔合術
Look, I'm fusing transected spinal cords.

88
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,480
以及刺激中樞神經的神經發生
I'm stimulating neurogenesis in the central nervous system.

89
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,440
我的工作在今后的年月里能拯救上千人
The work I'm doing is gonna save thousands for years to come.

90
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,650
而在急診室  至多就是救拿槍的笨蛋醉鬼
In ER, you get to save one drunk idiot with a gun.

91
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,950
是啊  我們急診室的人不過就是在救命
Yeah, you're right. In ER, we're only saving lives.

92
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,470
撈不到名聲  沒有CNN來采訪
There's no fame, there's no CNN interviews...

93
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,650
那我只能繼續用尼克了
Well, I guess I'll have to stick with Nic.

94
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,250
等等  你們不是...你倆沒...
Oh, wait a minute. You're not... you guys aren't...

95
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,050
什么
What?

96
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,240
上床吧
Sleeping together.

97
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,250
抱歉  我以為我厭惡的口氣能暗示我的意思了
Sorry, I thought that was implicit in my disgust.

98
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,650
其實非常明顯
Explicit, actually.

99
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,410
沒有  我有絕對不能跟同事約會的規矩
And no, I have a very strict rule against dating colleagues.

100
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,250
-是嗎  -我稱之為"斯特蘭奇準則"
- Oh really? - I call it the Strange policy.

101
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,360
太棒了  很高興有東西是以我命名的
Oh, good! I'm glad something's named after me.

102
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,250
我發明了一種椎板切除術手術
You know, I invented a laminectomy procedure,

103
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:39,990
但不知為何
and yet, somehow,

104
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,270
似乎沒人愿意管它叫"斯特蘭奇術"
no one seems to want to call it the Strange technique.

105
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,010
是我們一起發明了那個術式
We invented that technique.

106
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,280
不管怎樣  你的準則讓我受寵若驚
You know, regardless, I'm very flattered by your policy.

107
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,230
我...
Look, I'm...

108
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,600
我今晚要去參加個神經病學協會的晚宴
I'm talking tonight at a Neurological Society dinner.

109
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,210
一起來吧
Come with me.

110
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,870
又是去演講  真浪漫
Another speaking engagement? So romantic.

111
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,360
你以前可喜歡跟我去參加這類活動了
You used to love coming to those things with me.

112
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,390
-我們很開心的  -不  是你很開心
- We had fun together. - No. You've had fun.

113
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,370
那不是以我們為主  是以你為主
They weren't about us, they were about you.

114
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,510
也不僅僅是我
Not only about me.

115
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,220
斯蒂芬  什么事都是以你為中心的
Stephen. Everything is about you.

116
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,690
或許可以用連字符
Maybe we could hyphenate.

117
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,230
斯特蘭奇-帕爾默術
Strange-Palmer technique.

118
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,630
帕爾默-斯特蘭奇術
Palmer-Strange.

119
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,910
比利  都有什么
Billy! What have you got for me?

120
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,880
35歲的空軍上校
I've got a 35-year-old Air Force colonel.

121
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,410
穿實驗性裝甲壓碎了下脊柱
Crushed his lower spine in some kind of experimental armor.

122
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,040
中胸廓爆裂骨折
Mid-thoracic burst fracture.

123
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,140
嗯  我是可以幫忙
Yeah, well, I could help,

124
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,810
但還有50個人也能幫他
but so could 50 other people.

125
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,700
給我找點值得做的
Find me something worth my time.

126
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,450
68歲女士  晚期腦干膠質細胞瘤
I have a 68-year-old female with an advanced brain stem glioma.

127
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,750
你是想讓我破壞我的完美記錄嗎
Yeah, you want me to screw up my perfect record?

128
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,260
絕對不要
Definitely not.

129
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,670
22歲女性  腦內有電子植入物
How about a 22-year-old female with an electronic implant in her brain

130
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,380
以控制精神分裂癥  卻被閃電擊中
to control schizophrenia struck by lightning?

131
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,030
這個聽上去是很有趣
That does sound interesting.

132
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,770
能不能發給我...
Can you send me the...

133
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,280
收到了
got it.

134
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,660
沒事的  不會有事的
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

135
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,940
他們做了什么
What did they do?

136
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,160
他們用直升機送你過來的
They rushed you in a chopper.

137
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,220
但找到你費了不少時間
But it took a little while to find you.

138
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,780
你在車里時  修復神經損傷的黃金時期就過去了
The golden hours for nerve damage went by while you were in the car.

139
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,850
他們做了什么
What did they do?!

140
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,740
11根不銹鋼針插入骨頭

給你的身體點時間愈合

149

150
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,990
我還要多久才能...
How long until I can tak...

151
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,880
斯特蘭奇醫生  你的組織還在愈合
Dr. Strange... those tissues are still healing.

152

是昂貴的實驗性療法  但有可能

And then one day stopped coming. I thought he was dead.

- Walked? - Yeah, walked.

173
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,810
扯淡  拿他的病例給我
Bullshit. Show me his file.

174
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,750
從檔案館里找到他的病例得要點時間
It'll take me a while to pull the files from the archive.

175
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,210
但如果能證明你個自大鬼錯了
But if it proves your arrogant ass wrong,

176
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,910

我看過了你所有的研究

讀了你發來的所有論文  這是行不通的
I read all the papers you've sent, it's no gonna work.

I... I don't think you realize how severe the damages are...

180
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,780
-是這樣的  -最優秀的醫生都沒能做到
- Look, here's the thing, I... - The best have tried and failed.

181
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,230
我理解  是這樣的
Look, I understand. Here's the thing. I...

182
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,040
你要我做的事根本不可能  斯蒂芬

不不  等等
No, no, wait!

188
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,750
他不肯做
He won't do it.

189
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,010
他是個庸醫
He's a hack.

190
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,230
東京有種新手術
There is a new procedure in Tokyo.

191
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,760
他們培養捐獻者的干細胞

192
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,250
進行采集  然后3D打印個支架
harvesting them and 3D-printing a scaffold.

193
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,930
如果我能借到錢
If I could get a loan together, just...

194
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,000
-斯蒂芬  斯蒂芬  -一小筆  20萬
- Stephen... Stephen. - A small loan, 200,000.

195
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,240
你一直是掙多少花多少
You've always spent money as fast as you could make it

196
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,730
但你現在是在花你沒有的錢
but now you're spending money you don't even have.

197
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,420
或許該考慮停止了
Maybe it's time to consider stopping.

198
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,820
不  現在才更不能停止
No. Now is exactly the time not to stop.

199
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,570
因為  我并沒有好轉
Because, you see, I'm not getting any better!

200
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,160
但這已經不是求醫了  這是發瘋
But this isn't medicine anymore. This is mania.

201
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,680
有些東西就是治不好
Some things just can't be fixed.

202
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:23,960
-沒有工作的生活  -也還是生活
- Life without my work... - Is still life.

203
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,190
這不是末路
This isn't the end.

204
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,970
還有其他事能讓你的生命富有意義
There are other things that can give your life meaning.

205
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,800
什么  你嗎
Like what? Like you?

206
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,590
你現在該道歉了
And this is the part where you apologize.

207
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,470
你現在該走了
This is the part where you leave.

208
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,340
好吧  我也看不下去你再這么折磨自己了
Fine. I can't watch you do this to yourself anymore.

209
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,790
-太艱難了  是嗎  -沒錯
- Too difficult for you, is it? - Yes.

210
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:43,980
是的
It is.

211
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,150
看到你這樣令我心碎
It breaks my heart to see you this way.

212
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,050
不  別可憐我
No. Don't pity me.

213
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,150
我不是在可憐你
I'm not pitying you.

214
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,380
是嗎  那你為什么來
Oh yeah? Then what are you doing here?

215
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,430
帶奶酪和酒來
Bringing cheese and wine

216
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,010
好像我們是去吃野餐的老朋友
like we're old friends going for a picnic?

217
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,580
我們不是朋友  克里斯汀
We are not friends, Christine.

218
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,920
我們連情人都算不上
We were barely lovers.

219
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,960
你就喜歡悲劇故事  是吧
But you just love a sob story, don't you?

220
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,150
你現在就這么看我了嗎
Is that what I am to you now?

221
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,810
可憐的斯蒂芬·斯特蘭奇  施舍對象
Poor Stephen Strange, charity case.

222
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:01,790
他終于需要我了
He finally needs me.

223
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,130
又一個你可以拯救的人性渣滓
Another dreg of humanity for you to work on.

224
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,380
把他包扎好  讓他重新回歸社會
Patch him up and send him back into the world,

225
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,910
心里簡直要唱起歌
hearts just humming...

226
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,560
你非常在乎  是吧
You care so much! Don't you?!

227
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,060
再見  斯蒂芬

我不認識你

我是斯蒂芬·斯特蘭奇

Actually, you know what, man? I do know you.

我曾經去過你辦公室  你拒絕見我
I came to your office once. You refused to see me.

241
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,800
我連你助理那關都沒過
I never got past your assistant.

242
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,830
你當時沒法醫治
You were untreatable.

243
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,920
治不好就得不到榮譽  是吧
No glory for you in that, right?

244
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,050
你從萬劫不復的病情中康復了
You came back from a place there's no way back from!

245
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,830
我也想找到我的康復之路

潘伯恩  你還打不打了
Pangborn, are you in or you out?

247
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,100
好吧
All right.

248
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,370
我本來都放棄我的身體了
I'd given up on my body.

249
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,070
我以為我只剩下思維了
I thought my mind's the only thing I had left.

250
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,010
至少也該努力提升它一下
I should at least try to elevate that.

251
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,360
所以我去見大師
So I sat with gurus,

252
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,130
還有圣女
and sacred women.

00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,440
還有更深奧的秘密等著我學習
And there were deeper secrets to learn there,

260
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,460
但我沒有體力去接受了
but I didn't have the strength to receive them.

261
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,700
我安于我的奇跡  回家來了
I chose to settle for my miracle, and I came back home.

- But the cost there is high. - How much?

264
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,890
我指的不是錢
I'm not talking about money.

Good luck.

Your watch.

277
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,400
不  求你們了
No, please.

278
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,620
-我只剩這個了  -你的手表
- It's all I have left. - Your watch.

279
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,930
好吧
All right.

280
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,030
你在找卡馬塔奇
You're looking for Kamar-Taj?

281
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,910
真的嗎
Really?

282
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,930
你確定找對地方了嗎
Sure you got the right place?

283
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,580
那里看起來更...
That one looks a little more...

284
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,950
卡馬塔奇一些
Kamar Taj-y.

285
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,420
我曾經和你一樣
I once stood in your place.

286
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,260
我也曾經...
And I, too, was...

287
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,560
很不敬
disrespectful.

288
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,580
我給你點建議
So might I offer you some advice?

289
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,810
忘掉你自以為知道的一切
Forget everything you think you know.

290
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,350
好吧
All right.

291
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,440
這圣殿屬于我們的導師
The sanctuary of our teacher.

292
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,610
古一法師
The Ancient One.

293
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,620
古一法師  他真名叫什么
The Ancient One? What's his real name?

294
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,980
對了  忘掉我自以為知道的一切  抱歉
Right. Forget everything I think I know. Sorry.

295
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,280
感謝你...
Thank you for...

296
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,730
好吧  這是...規矩嗎
Okay, that's, uh... a thing...

297
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,070
謝謝
Thank you for...

298
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,380
你好
Hello.

299
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,990
謝謝
Uh, thank you.

300
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,160
也謝謝你
And thank you.

301
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:20,350
感謝你  古一法師  愿意見我
Uh, thank you, Ancient One... for... seeing me...

302
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,950
不客氣
You're very welcome.

303
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,450
-古一法師  -謝謝  莫多法師
- The Ancient One. - Thank you, Master Mordo.

304
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,090
謝謝  哈密爾法師
Thank you, Master Hamir!

305
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,820
斯特蘭奇先生
Mr. Strange!

306
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,550
其實是博士
Doctor, actually.

307
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,210
肯定不再是了
Well, no. Not anymore, surely.

308
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,620
你不正是因此而來的嗎
Isn't that why you're here?

309
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,790
你做了許多次手術
You've undergone many procedures.

310
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,180
-七次  對吧  -對
- Seven, right? - Yeah...

311
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,270
-好茶  -是啊
- It's good tea. - Yes.

312
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:54,560
你是不是治好了一個叫潘伯恩的人  他癱瘓了
Did you heal a man named Pangborn? A paralyzed man.

313
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,620
算是吧
In a way.

314
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,540
你幫了他  他又能走了
You helped him to walk again.

315
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,010
對
Yes.

316
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,830
你是怎么治好C7-C8脊椎完全性損傷的
How did you correct a complete C7-C8 spinal cord injury?

317
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,270
不是治好了
I didn't correct it.

318
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,710
他不能走  我讓他相信他能
He couldn't walk; I convinced him that he could.

319
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,620
你不是指身心治療吧
You're not suggesting it was psychosomatic?

320
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,670
你把斷掉的神經接好后
When you reattach a severed nerve,

321
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,330
是你  還是身體讓它痊愈
is it you who heals it back together or the body?

322
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,730
-是細胞  -而細胞被設定好
- It's the cells. - And the cells are only programmed

323
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:19,240
以特定的方式來痊愈
to put themselves back together in very specific ways.

324
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,110
對
Right.

325
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,960
如果我告訴你  你可以說服身體相信
What if I told you that your own body could be convinced

326
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,470
它能以各種各樣的方式痊愈呢
to put itself back together in all sorts of ways?

327
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,960
你是說細胞再生
You're talking about cellular regeneration.

328
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,100
這種技術非常尖端
That's... bleeding-edge medical tech.

329
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,310
所以你才在這里工作嗎
Is that why you're working here,

330
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,660
脫離醫院董事會的監管
without a governing medical board? I mean...

331
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,850
你的治療方法實驗性多強
just how experimental is your treatment?

332
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,050
非常強
Quite.

333
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:47,140
所以  你有辦法讓神經細胞重組自愈嗎
So, you've figured out a way to reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?

334
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,950
不  斯特蘭奇先生
No, Mr. Strange.

335
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:54,400
我知道如何調整精神力量  使身體更好地愈合
I know how to reorient the spirit to better heal the body.

336
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,800
精神力量...愈合身體
The spirit... to heal the body.

337
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,820
沒錯
That's right.

338
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,060
好吧
No. Al... Al... All right.

339
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,380
我們要怎么做  從哪開始
How do we do that? Where do we start?

340
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,430
不喜歡那張圖嗎
Don't like that map?

341
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,950
不是的  它真的很不錯
Oh, no. It's... it's really good.

342
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,080
只是...我以前見過這個
It's just... you know, I've seen it before.

343
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,190
在禮品店里
In gift shops.

344
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,820
那這張呢
And what about this one?

345
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,650
-針灸  厲害  -是吧
- Acupuncture, great. - Yeah?

346
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,610
那張怎么樣
What about... that one?

347
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,910
你是在給我看核磁共振圖嗎  難以置信
Showing me an MRI scan? I do not believe this.

348
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:33,830
畫每張圖的人  都只能窺視局部
Each of those maps was drawn up by someone who could see in part,

349
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,030
而看不到全局
but not the whole.

350
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,820
我為來這兒  花了最后的一點錢
I spent my last dollar getting here

351
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,610
買了張單程票
one-way ticket,

352
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:41,050
你卻在跟我說信仰治療
and you're talking to me about healing through belief?

353
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,540
你是一個通過鑰匙孔窺視世界的人
You're a man looking at the world through a keyhole,

354
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:46,420
你這一生  都在試圖擴大那個鑰匙孔
you've spent your whole life trying to widen that keyhole.

355
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,410
想看到更多  知道更多
To see more, to know more.

356
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:51,320
而如今聽聞  這鑰匙孔可以擴大
And now, on hearing that it can be widen

357
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:54,790
是以你無法想象的方式  你卻抗拒這個可能性嗎
in ways you can't imagine, you reject the possibility?

358
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:57,480
不  我拒絕是因為我不信天方夜譚
No, I reject it because I do not believe in fairy tales

359
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,020
什么脈輪  能量  信仰的力量
about chakras, or energy, or the power of belief.

360
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,550
根本沒有精神力量這東西
There is no such thing as spirit!

361
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,110
我們都由物質構成  別無他物
We are made of matter, and nothing more.

362
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,910
你只是一粒小小的  轉瞬即逝的塵埃
You're just another tiny, momentary speck

363
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,730
漂浮在這冷漠的世界里
within an indifferent universe.

364
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,040
你太妄自菲薄了
You think too little of yourself.

365
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,200
你自以為能看穿我  是嗎
You think you see through me, do you?

366
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,340
你才不能呢
Well, you don't.

367
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,720
我倒是看穿你了
But I see through you!!

368
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,750
你剛對我做了什么
What did you just do to me?!

369
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,050
我將你的魂體打出了你的肉體
I pushed your astral form out of your physical form.

370
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,150
那杯茶里加了什么
What's in that tea?

371
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,610
裸頭草堿[迷幻藥]  還是迷幻劑
Psilocybin? LSD?

372
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,760
就是茶
It's just tea.

373
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,760
加了一點蜂蜜
With a little honey.

374
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,250
剛發生了什么
What just happened?

375
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,370
那一瞬間  你進入了精神次元
For a moment, you entered the astral dimension.

376
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:56,130
-什么  -魂魄與軀殼不共生的地方
- The what? - A place where the soul exists apart from the body.

377
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,930
你為什么要這樣對我
Why are you doing this to me?

378
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,470
為了讓你明白你有多無知
To show you just how much you don't know.

379
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,550
睜開你的眼睛
Open your eye.

380
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,190
該死
Shit!

381
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,990
上帝啊  上帝啊
Oh god! Oh god!

382
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,170
不不不不不
No. No. No. No. No. No.

383
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,270
怎么回事
What's happening?

384
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,260
這不是真的  不是真的
This isn't real. This isn't real.

385
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,810
不是真的  這是...
This isn't real. This is...

386
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,170
上帝啊
Oh god!

387
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,310
不不不不不
No. No. No. No. No. No.

388
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,200
他的心率太高  有點危險
His heart rate is getting dangerously high.

389
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,980
我看他挺好的
He looks all right to me.

390
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:42,740
你自以為明白這世界如何運轉
You think you know how the world works?

391
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,830
你以為這物質宇宙就是全部了嗎
You think that this material universe is all there is?

392
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,760
何為真實
What is real?

393
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:58,380
你感官無法觸及之處  還有怎樣的奧秘
What mysteries lie beyond the reach of your senses?

394
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:05,320
在萬物存在的根源處  思維與物質交合
At the root of existence, mind and matter meet.

395
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,800
思維塑造現實
Thoughts shape reality.

396
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:25,440
這個宇宙不過無數個宇宙之一
This universe is only one of an infinite number.

397
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,810
無盡的世界
Worlds without end.

398
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,400
有些世界充滿仁愛與生命
Some benevolent and life-giving;

399
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:39,650
有些則滿是惡念與饑荒
Others filled with malice and hunger.

400
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:47,800
還有黑暗之地  存在著比時間更古老的力量
Dark places, where powers older than time lie...

401
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,360
貪婪地
ravenous...

402
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,420
等待著
and waiting.

403
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:03,030
在浩瀚的多元宇宙間  你是誰
Who are you in this vast multiverse,

404
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,610
斯特蘭奇先生
Mr. Strange?

405
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,770
你在禮品店見過這個嗎
Have you seen that before in a gift shop?

406
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,600
教教我
Teach me!

407
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,490
不
No.

408
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,110
不...
No...

409
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,360
不要
No!

410
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,740
不不不不  不要
No, no, no, no no no no!

411
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:56,430
不要  開門  求你了
No! Open the door! Please!

412
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,880
謝謝  各位法師
Thank you, Masters.

413
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,940
你覺得我不該趕他走嗎
You think I was wrong to cast him out?

414
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,750
五小時了  他還在你門口
5 hours later, he's still on your doorstep.

415
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:13,400
他身上有股力量
There's a strength to him.

416
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:18,440
頑固  自負  野心...我都見過
Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition... I've seen it all before.

417
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,770
他讓你想起了卡西利亞斯嗎
He reminds you of Kaecilius?

418
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:24,120
我不能再教另一個天賦異稟的學生學會強大法術
I cannot lead another gifted student to power,

419
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,260
再看著他被黑暗吞噬
only to lose him to the darkness.

420
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,830
我就沒有那樣
You didn't lose me.

421
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,630
我想獲得力量  打敗敵人
I wanted the power to defeat my enemies.

422
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:36,210
你給了我力量打敗心魔
You gave me the power to defeat my demons.

423
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:39,560
并遵守自然法則
And to live within the natural law.

424
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,040
我們永遠不能擺脫心魔  莫多
We never lose our demons, Mordo.

425
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,240
我們只能學會抑制它們
We only learn to live above them.

426
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,130
被偷的幾頁書還在卡西利亞斯手上
Kaecilius still has the stolen pages.

427
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,780
如果他成功破解  就能毀滅我們所有人
If he deciphers them, he could bring ruin upon us all.

428
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,060
黑暗的日子可能就要到來
There may be dark days ahead.

429
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,580
卡馬塔奇或許用得上斯特蘭奇這樣的人
Perhaps Kamar-Taj could use a man like Strange.

430
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,350
別把我擋在外面
Don't shut me out.

431
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,640
我沒別的地方可去了
I haven't got anywhere else to go.

432
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,730
謝謝
Thank you.

433
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,980
洗澡
Bathe.

434
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,040
休息
Rest.

435
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,340
或是冥想
Meditate...

436
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,930
如果你可以的話
if you can.

437
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,750
古一法師會派人來找你的
The Ancient One will send for you.

438
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,940
這是什么  我的咒語嗎
What's this? My mantra?

439
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,980
是無線網密碼
The Wi-Fi password.

440
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,940
我們又不是野蠻人
We're not savages.

441
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:20,450
{\an8}{\pos(329,173)}時間會表明
我愛你多深
~
克里斯汀

442
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,450
魔法的語言和人類文明一樣古老
The language of the mystic arts is as old as civilization.

443
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,800
古代的法師
The sorcerers of antiquity

444
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,950
把這種語言的使用稱為"咒語"
called the use of this language "Spells".

445
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:39,520
但如果這個詞有違你的現代思維
But if that word offends your modern sensibilities,

446
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,850
你可以把它稱作"程序"
you can call it a "Program".

447
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:45,090
它是塑造了現實的源代碼
The source code that shapes reality.

448
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,700
我們汲取能量
We harness energy

449
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:52,360
來自多元宇宙其他次元的能量
drawn from other dimensions of the multiverse,

450
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,500
來施咒
to cast spells,

451
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,530
變出護盾
to conjure shields

452
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,380
和武器
and weapons

453
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,110
創造魔法
to make magic.

454
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,750
但是
But...

455
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,340
即使我的手指可以做到
even if my fingers could do that,

456
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:26,110
我的手也只是在胡亂揮舞而已
my hands would just be waving in the air. I mean,

457
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:28,320
我怎么才能達到你那種程度呢
how do I get from here to there?

458
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,010
那你是如何能連接斷裂的神經
How did you get to reattach severed nerves, and

459
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:34,840
一節一節地修復人的脊椎呢
put a human spine back together bone by bone?

460
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,320
多年的學習和練習
Study and practice. Years of it.

461
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,150
-斯特蘭奇先生  -叫我斯蒂芬就好
- Mr. Strange. - Stephen, please.

462
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:56,030
-那你是  -王
- And you are? - Wong.

463
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,980
王
Wong.

464
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,870
就單一個王嗎
Just Wong?

465
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,730
就像  阿黛爾
Like... Adele?

466
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,680
或者  亞里士多德
Or... Aristotle.

467
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,290
德雷克
Drake.

468
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:08,810
博諾
Bono.

469
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,350
阿姆
Eminem.

470
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,130
《幻日之書》
The Book of the Invisible Sun.

471
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,450
《新天文學》
Astronomia Nova.

472
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,700
《統御法典》
Codex Imperium.

473
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,480
《所羅門鑰匙》
Key of Solomon.

474
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,090
-你全都看完了嗎  -對
- You finished all of this? - Yup.

475
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,490
-跟我來  -好
- Come with me. - All right.

476
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,750
這個區域僅對法師開放
This section is for Masters only.

477
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,150
但如果有我的允許  其他人也可以看
But at my discretion, others may use it.

478
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,520
從《馬克西姆的啟蒙》開始看吧
We should start with Maxim's Primer.

479
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,470
你的梵文怎么樣
How's your Sanskrit?

480
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,700
我谷歌翻譯用得挺溜
I'm fluent in Google Translate.

481
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,100
吠陀  古典梵語
Vedic, classical Sanskrit.

482
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,480
那些是什么
What are those?

483
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,460
古一法師的私人收藏
The Ancient One's private collection.

484
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,370
所以禁止閱覽嗎
So they're forbidden?

485
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,010
卡馬塔奇沒有禁止閱覽的知識
No knowledge in Kamar-Taj is forbidden.

486
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,700
只有個別禁施的法術
Only certain practices.

487
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,450
除了至尊法師
Those books are far too advanced

488
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,000
那些書對其他人來說太過深奧
for anyone other than the Sorcerer Supreme.

489
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,930
這本書有缺頁
This one's got pages missing.

490
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:30,600
那是《卡里奧斯特羅之書》  是研究時間的
That's the Book of Cagliostro. A study of time.

491
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:34,370
一個前法師偷走了一個法事
One of the rituals was stolen by a former Master.

492
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:37,570
是個狂熱信徒  叫卡西利亞斯
The zealot, Kaecilius.

493
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,150
他還把前任圖書管理員吊了起來
Just after he strung up the former librarian,

494
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,360
并砍下了他的首級
and relieved him of his head.

495
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,250
現在我來守衛這些書
I am now the guardian of these books.

496
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:52,930
所以如果再有一本藏書被偷
So if a volume from this collection should be stolen again,

497
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,570
我都會知道
I'd know it.

498
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,140
你還不及離開這里就會沒命
And you'd be dead before you ever left the compound.

499
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,850
那如果只是逾期了呢
What if it's just overdue? You know?

500
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,840
會有什么逾期費嗎  打個傷殘什么的
Any... late fees I should know about? Maiming, perhaps.

501
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,800
知道嗎  以前大家都覺得我很幽默呢
You know, people used to think that I was funny.

502
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,130
他們是你的手下嗎
Did they work for you?

503
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:16,400
好吧  跟你談話真愉快
All right. Well, it's been lovely talking to you,

504
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,180
謝謝你給我找書  給我講恐怖故事
thank you for the books and for the horrifying story and

505
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,190
并對我進行人身威脅
for the threat upon my life.

506
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:57,380
現在我們將得到力量消滅背叛我們的人
We will now receive the power to destroy the one who betrayed us.

507
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,740
也是背叛世界的人
The one who betrays the world.

508
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,200
掌握懸戒是學習魔法必不可少的
Mastery of the sling ring is essential to the mystic arts.

509
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,610
懸戒讓我們可以在多元宇宙中穿行
They allow us to travel throughout the multiverse.

510
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,880
你所要做的就是集中精神
All you need to do is focus.

511
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,600
去想象
Visualize.

512
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,400
在腦海中勾勒出目的地
See the destination in your mind.

513
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,930
目光超越你面前的世界
Look beyond the world in front of you.

514
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,740
想象出每個細節
Imagine every detail.

515
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,280
畫面越清晰  召喚傳送門就會
The clearer the picture, the quicker, and easier,

516
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,600
越快  越容易
the gateway will come.

517
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,450
停下
And stop.

518
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:37,420
我想和斯特蘭奇先生單獨談談
I would like a moment alone with Mr. Strange.

519
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,290
沒問題
Of course.

520
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,840
-都怪我的手  -這和你的手無關
- My hands. - It's not about your hands.

521
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,050
這怎么會和我的手無關
How is this not about my hands?

522
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,450
哈密爾法師
Master Hamir.

523
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,460
有勞了  哈密爾法師
Thank you, Master Hamir.

524
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,920
你無法打得河流服從你
You cannot beat a river into submission.

525
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,810
你得順應它的流勢
You have to surrender to its current,

526
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,780
化其力量為己用
and use its power as your own.

527
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,520
我要放棄掌控  才能掌控它嗎
I... I control it by surrendering control?

528
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,660
那根本沒道理啊
That doesn't make any sense.

529
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:20,460
并非凡事都有道理  也并非都必須有道理
Not everything does. Not everything has to.

530
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,850
你的智力引領了你的人生
Your intellect has taken you far in life.

531
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,530
但它不會讓你更進一步了
But it will take you no further.

532
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:27,590
順從吧  斯蒂芬
Surrender, Stephen.

533
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,740
放下你的自負
Silence your ego

534
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,270
你的力量才會顯現
and your power will rise.

535
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,040
跟我來
Come with me.

536
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:42,680
-等等  這是不是...  -珠穆朗瑪峰
- Wait. Is this... - Everest.

537
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,930
-真美  -沒錯
- Beautiful. - Yeah, right.

538
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:50,510
很美  很冷  但...很美
Beautiful. Freezing, but... beautiful.

539
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:54,260
在這種溫度下  人只能存活30分鐘
At this temperature, a person can last for 30 minutes

540
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:57,770
-然后就會永久喪失身體機能  -太好了
- before suffering permanent loss of function. - Great.

541
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,860
但前兩分鐘內你大概就會休克
But you'll likely go into shock within the first 2.

542
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:02,670
什么
What?

543
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:06,330
-順從吧  斯蒂芬  -不不  不要
- Surrender, Stephen. - No, no!!! Don't!

544
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,990
-新來的怎么樣了  -即將見分曉
- How's our new recruit? - We shall see.

545
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,750
隨時了
Any second now.

546
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,240
不會吧  又來
No, not again.

547
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,690
或許我該...
Maybe I should...

548
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,910
-斯蒂芬  -王
- Stephen. - Wong.

549
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:49,680
-你要什么  斯特蘭奇  -魂體投射的書
- What do you want, Strange? - Books on astral projection.

550
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:53,940
-你還沒準備好  -放馬過來  碧昂斯
- You're not ready for that. - Try me, Beyonce.

551
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,330
得了  你聽說過她吧  她可是大腕啊
Come on. You've heard of her. She's a huge star, right?

552
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,070
你笑過嗎
Do you ever laugh?

553
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,820
得了  把書給我吧
Come on, just give me the book.

554
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,910
不行
No.

555
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,260
就在這個房間  你曾求我教你
Once, in this room, you begged me to let you learn.

556
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,280
如今我卻聽說  你質疑所有教導
Now I'm told you question every lesson,

557
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,960
而更喜歡自學
prefering to teach yourself.

558
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,120
就在這個房間  你曾要我睜開眼睛
Once, in this room, you told me to open my eyes.

559
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,870
如今我卻聽說  要盲目遵守毫無道理的規矩
Now I'm being told to blindly accept rules that make no sense.

560
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:54,050
比如不能在圖書館里開傳送門嗎
Like the rule against conjuring a gateway in the library?

561
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:55,250
王打我小報告
Wong told on me?

562
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,600
你的魔法法術進步很快
You're advancing quickly with your sorcery skills.

563
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:01,250
你需要一個安全的地方練習咒語
You need a safe space to practice your spells.

564
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:21,660
你現在處于鏡像次元中
You are now inside the Mirror Dimension.

565
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,780
永恒存在但不會被發覺
Ever present but undetected.

566
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,800
這里的事不會影響真實世界
The real world isn't affected by what happens here.

567
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:31,390
我們在鏡像次元中訓練  監視
We use the Mirror Dimension to train, surveil,

568
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:34,260
也會用它來控制威脅
and sometimes to contain threats.

569
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,040
千萬不要沒戴懸戒被困在這里
You don't wanna be stuck in here without your sling ring.

570
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,680
等等  抱歉  你剛說的威脅是什么意思
Hold on. Sorry, what do you mean, threats?

571
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,530
了解無窮的多元宇宙
Learning of an infinite multiverse

572
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:53,990
就也要了解無盡的危險
includes learning of infinite dangers.

573
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,900
如果我把所有你尚不知道的東西都告訴你
And if I told you everything else that you don't already know,

574
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,660
你只會倉皇逃跑
you'd run from here in terror.

575
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:07,140
話說  她究竟有多老
So, just how ancient is she?

576
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:11,990
沒人知道至尊法師的年齡
No one knows the age of the Sorcerer Supreme.

577
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:15,430
只知道她是凱爾特人  從不提起往事
Only that she is Celtic and never talks about her past.

578
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,570
你不了解她還追隨她
You follow her even though you don't know?

579
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:20,100
我知道她堅定不移  卻又高深莫測
I know that she's steadfast, but unpredictable.

580
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:22,250
無情  卻有仁愛之心
Merciless, yet kind.

581
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:24,820
是她成就了如今的我
She made me what I am.

582
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:28,310
相信你的導師
Trust your teacher.

583
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:30,810
切勿迷失方向
And don't lose your way.

584
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,870
-像卡西利亞斯那樣嗎  -對
- Like Kaecilius? - That's right.

585
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:39,490
你認識他
You knew him.

586
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,780
他剛來時  失去了所有摯愛之人
When he first came to us, he'd lost everyone he ever loved.

587
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,570
他悲痛欲絕
He was a grieving, broken man,

588
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:47,700
在魔法中尋找答案
searching for answers in the mystic arts.

589
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:51,360
他是個才華橫溢的學生  但自傲又頑固
A brilliant student, but he was proud, headstrong.

590
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:54,310
他質疑古一法師  排斥我們的教導
He questioned the Ancient One, rejected our teaching.

591
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:02,840
他離開了卡馬塔奇
He left Kamar-Taj.

592
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:05,690
他的門徒如羊群般跟隨
His disciples followed him like sheep

593
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,090
被偽教義迷惑
seduced by false doctrine.

594
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:11,580
-他偷了一個禁忌法事  對嗎  -對
- He stole the forbidden ritual, right? - Yes.

595
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:12,860
那是干什么的
What did it do?

596
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,520
別再問問題了
No more questions.

597
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,250
-那是什么  -這也是問題
- What's that? - That's a question.

598
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,330
這是個法器
This is a relic.

599
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:26,150
有些魔法太過強大  無法維持
Some magic is too powerful to sustain,

600
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:28,070
我們唯有將其注入物件之中
so we imbue objects with it.

601
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,890
讓它們去承受我們承受不了的負擔
Allowing them to take the strain we can not.

602
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:31,920
這
This

603
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:35,920
就是生命法庭權杖
is the Staff of the Living Tribunal.

604
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:40,790
有很多法器
There are many relics.

605
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:42,490
瓦圖姆魔杖
The Wand of Watoomb.

606
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:44,780
佛多之靴
The Vaulting Boots of Valtorr.

607
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:47,240
真是朗朗上口  對吧
Really just roll off the tongue, don't they?

608
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:49,150
我什么時候能有自己的法器
When do I get my relic?

609
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:51,210
-等你準備好  -我覺得我準備好了
- When you're ready. - I think I'm ready.

610
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:53,980
法器覺得你準備好了  你才算準備好了
You're ready when the relic decides you're ready.

611
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:55,760
現在
For now,

612
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:58,370
變出一個武器來吧
conjure a weapon.

613
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:00,500
好吧
All right.

614
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,250
戰斗
Fight!

615
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:11,250
就好像你命系于此
Fight like your life depended on it!

616
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:19,620
因為有一天  或許真會如此
Because one day, it may.

617
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:42,980
{\an8}{\pos(187,155)}克里斯汀

618
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:51,650
{\an8}{\pos(171,161)}我再給你發一次郵件

619
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:31,240
王
Wong?

620
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:44,940
好了
Okay.

621
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:48,940
首先  打開阿戈摩托之眼
First, open the Eye of Agamotto.

622
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,270
好吧
All right.

623
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:34,920
我的天
Oh my.

624
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,460
能不能...
What if...

625
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:14,040
多瑪姆
Dormammu.

626
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:17,210
黑暗次元
The Dark Dimension.

627
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:19,600
永生
Eternal life?

628
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,720
怎么...
What the...

629
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,050
停下
Stop!!!

630
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,140
干涉時空連續性是大忌
Tampering with continuum probabilitie is forbidden!

631
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:35,820
我只是...在照書上的指示操作
I... I wa... I was just doing exactly what it said in the book!

632
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:36,900
那進行法事的危險
And what did the book say

633
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:38,670
書上是怎么說的呢
about the dangers of performing that ritual?

634
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:40,440
我不知道  我還沒看到那兒
I don't know. I hadn't gotten to that part yet.

635
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,520
操縱時間會創建出時間分支
Temporal manipulations can create branches in time.

636
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,140
不穩定的次元開口
Unstable dimensional openings.

637
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,670
空間悖論  時間循環
Spatial paradoxes! Time loops!!!

638
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:52,100
你想被困在一遍遍重復的時間段里嗎
You wanna get stuck reliving the same moment over, and over, forever,

639
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:53,820
或是存在完全被抹去
or never having existed at all?

640
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:56,780
警告真的應該放在咒語前
Really should put the warnings before the spell.

641
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:59,120
你的好奇心可能會害死你
Your curiosity could have gotten you killed.

642
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,580
你不是在操縱時空連續性
You weren't manipulating the space-time continuum,

643
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,840
而是在破壞它
you were breaking it.

644
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:06,150
我們不打破自然法則
We do not tamper with natural law.

645
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,140
而是保衛它
We defend it.

646
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:08,650
你怎么做到的
How did you even do that?

647
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:11,980
你從哪學到的理解它所需要的
Where did you learn the litany of spells required

648
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,010
冗長的咒語
to even understand it?

649
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:14,310
我過目不忘
I've got a photographic memory.

650
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:16,420
所以才能同時拿到醫學和哲學博士學位
That's how I got my M.D. and Ph.D. at the same time.

651
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:17,600
你剛剛做到的
What you just did

652
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:20,540
需要的不僅是好記性
takes more than a good memory.

653
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,290
你就是為魔法而生的
You were born for the mystic arts.

654
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:26,050
-但我的手還在抖  -暫時還在抖
- And yet, my hands still shake. - For now, yes.

655
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:28,450
-不會永遠如此嗎  -我們不是先知
- Not forever? - We're not prophets.

656
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:30,430
你們什么時候才肯告訴我  我們是什么
When are you gonna start telling me what we are?

657
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:37,320
復仇者那樣的英雄
While heroes like the Avengers

658
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,740
保護世界免受實體傷害
protect the world from physical dangers,

659
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:43,670
而我們法師捍衛世界  抵御魔法威脅
we sorcerers safeguard it against more mystical threats.

660
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,540
古一法師是最新一位繼承了至尊法師頭銜的人
The Ancient One is the latest in a long line of Sorcerers Supreme.

661
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:52,150
他們可追溯至千百年前的魔法鼻祖
Going back thousands of years to the father of the mystic arts,

662
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,700
全能的阿戈摩托
the mighty Agamotto.

663
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,390
就是那個創造了被你魯莽借用的魔眼法器的法師
Same sorcerer who created the eye you so recklessly borrowed.

664
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,610
阿戈摩托在魔力強的地方造了三座圣殿
Agamotto built 3 Sanctums in places of power,

665
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:05,470
這些地方如今都是大城市
where great cities now stand.

666
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,210
那扇門通往香港圣殿
That door leads to the Hong Kong Sanctum,

667
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:10,700
那扇通往紐約圣殿
that door to the New York Sanctum.

668
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,380
那扇通往倫敦圣殿
That one, to the London Sanctum.

669
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:15,410
三座圣殿一起
Together, the Sanctums

670
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:18,520
生成了一面保護世界的盾牌
generate a protective shield around our world.

671
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,740
圣殿保護世界
The Sanctums protect the world,

672
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:24,130
我們法師保護圣殿
and we sorcerers protect the Sanctums.

673
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:25,830
抵御什么
From what?

674
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:29,230
其他次元里威脅我們宇宙的存在
Other-dimensional beings that threaten our universe.

675
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:30,770
比如多瑪姆
Like Dormammu?

676
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:33,800
你從哪知道的這個名字
Where did you learn that name?

677
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:37,500
我剛在《卡里奧斯特羅之書》里讀到的  怎么了
I just read it in the book of Cagliostro. Why?

678
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:45,090
多瑪姆存在于黑暗次元中
Dormammu dwells in the Dark Dimension.

679
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:47,540
超越時間
Beyond time.

680
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:52,650
他是宇宙征服者  世界摧毀者
He is the cosmic conquerer, the destroyer of worlds.

681
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:56,360
擁有無盡力量和無限渴望
A being of infinite power and endless hunger,

682
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:59,080
他想要侵略所有宇宙
on a quest to invade every universe

683
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:02,300
把所有世界都納入他的黑暗次元
and bring all worlds into his Dark Dimension.

684
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,220
他最渴望地球
And he hungers for Earth most of all.

685
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:08,710
卡西利亞斯偷的那幾頁
The pages that Kaecilius stole.

686
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,720
一種聯系多瑪姆
A ritual to contact Dormammu

687
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,170
并從黑暗次元中汲取能量的法事
and draw power from the Dark Dimension.

688
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:17,900
好吧
Okay.

689
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:19,370
好吧
Okay.

690
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:21,980
我退出  我...
I'm out. I...

691
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:25,070
我是來治手的
I came here to heal my hands,

692
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,000
不是來打什么魔法戰爭
not to fight in some mystical war.

693
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:32,520
倫敦
London.

694
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:37,730
卡西利亞斯
Kaecilius!

695
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:39,160
不
No!!!

696
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,350
王  莫多
Wong? Mordo?

697
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:25,420
{\an8}{\pos(197,72)}布里克街117A

698
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:39,250
有人嗎
Hello?

699
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,810
有人嗎
Hello?

700
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:49,470
丹尼爾
Daniel.

701
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,150
他們任命你為這座圣殿的法師了啊
I see they made you Master of this Sanctum.

702
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,420
你知道那意味著什么嗎
You know what that means?

703
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,290
你會為保護它而死
That you'll die protecting it.

704
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:14,700
住手
Stop!

705
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:28,510
你到卡馬塔奇多久了  你叫...
How long have you been at Kamar-Taj, Mister...?

706
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,620
是博士
Doctor.

707
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,290
-博士先生  -我姓斯特蘭奇[是挺怪]
- Mr Doctor? - It's Strange.

708
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:36,810
也許吧
Maybe.

709
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:38,650
這又不由我來說
Who am I to judge?

710
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:05,340
你不知道怎么用  是吧
You don't know how to use that, do you?

711
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:51,650
什么
What?

712
01:01:57,110 --> 01:01:57,920
別說了
Stop it.

713
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,550
叫你別說了
I said, stop it!

714
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:01,060
你阻止不了它的  博士先生
You cannot stop this, Mr. Doctor.

715
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:03,350
聽著  我都不知道"它"是什么
Why... look, I don't even know what "This" is.

716
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:06,510
它既是開始也是結束
It's the end and the beginning.

717
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:10,090
多數人變成少數人  變成唯一
The many becoming the few, becoming the One.

718
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:13,000
你要是不想說明白
Look, if you're not gonna start making sense,

719
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,830
我就再給你戴上它
I'm just gonna have to put this thing back on.

720
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:16,010
告訴我  博士先生
Tell me, Mr. Doctor.

721
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:19,630
聽著  我叫斯蒂芬·斯特蘭奇博士
All right, look. My name is Dr. Stephen Strange.

722
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:21,110
-你是博士  -對
- You are a doctor? - Yeah.

723
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:22,420
科學家
A scientist.

724
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,790
你懂自然規律
You understand the laws of nature.

725
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:27,710
一切事物都會變老死去
All things age. All things die.

726
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,690
最終  太陽將燃盡
In the end, our sun burns out,

727
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:32,170
我們的宇宙將變冷毀滅
our universe grows cold and perishes.

728
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:33,890
但黑暗次元
But the Dark Dimension...

729
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:36,600
那個地方超越了時間
it's a place beyond time.

730
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:38,540
夠了  我再給你戴上
That's it. I'm putting this thing back on.

731
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:40,270
這個世界不非得滅亡  博士
This world doesn't have to die, Doctor.

732
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:43,100
這個世界有權和其他很多世界一樣
This world can take its rightful place alongside so many others,

733
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:44,200
成為唯一的一部分
as part of the One.

734
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,290
偉大而美麗的唯一
The great and beautiful One.

735
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,880
我們都能永生
And we can all live forever.

736
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:50,370
是嘛
Really?

737
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:56,420
這個新時代烏托邦次元對你有什么好處
What do you have to gain out of this New Age dimensional utopia?

738
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,220
跟你  跟所有人一樣
The same as you. The same as everyone.

739
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:01,010
生命  永恒的生命
Life. Eternal life.

740
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,390
人們總是從善惡角度思考
People think in terms of good and evil,

741
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:05,720
但其實時間才是所有人真正的敵人
when really, time is the true enemy of us all.

742
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:07,490
時間會殺死一切
Time kills everything.

743
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:09,510
那你殺死的人呢
What about the people you killed?

744
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:11,870
那都只是微小  轉瞬即逝的塵埃
Tiny, momentary specks

745
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:13,410
漂浮在這冷漠的世界里
within an indifferent universe.

746
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:17,010
是的  你明白了吧
Yes. You see,

747
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,490
你明白我們在做什么了吧
you see what we're doing?

748
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:22,320
這世界不是它應該有的樣子
The world is not what it ought to be.

749
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,670
人類渴望永恒
Humanity longs for the eternal,

750
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:27,650
渴望超越時間的世界  因為時間奴役我們
for a world beyond time, because time is what enslaves us.

751
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:29,580
時間是一種侮辱
Time is an insult.

752
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,660
死亡是一種侮辱
Death is an insult.

753
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:34,130
博士
Doctor...

754
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,230
我們不求統治世界
We don't seek to rule this world.

755
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,480
我們求的是拯救它  把它交給多瑪姆
We seek to save it, to hand it over to Dormammu,

756
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,090
他才是一切進化的目的
who is the intent of all evolution,

757
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:45,860
才是一切生命存在的緣由
the Why of all existence.

758
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:49,570
至尊法師保衛生命
The Sorcerer Supreme defends existence.

759
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:53,330
是什么讓你前往卡馬塔奇  博士
What was it that brought you to Kamar-Taj, Doctor?

760
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:54,960
是教化
Was it enlightenment?

761
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:56,510
還是力量
Power?

762
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:01,320
你是想去被治愈  我們都是
You came to be healed, as did we all.

763
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:05,620
卡馬塔奇吸納了各種殘破的東西
Kamar-Taj is a place that collects broken things.

764
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:07,450
我們都是為治愈的希望而來
We all come with the promise of being healed,

765
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:10,530
但結果  古一只教我們些雕蟲小技
and instead, the Ancient One gives us parlor tricks.

766
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:13,850
真正的魔法被她據為己有
The real magic she keeps for herself.

767
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:17,320
你就沒想過她是怎么活得這么久的嗎
You ever wondered how she managed to live this long?

768
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:25,720
我在《卡里奧斯特羅之書》中看到了那些法事
I saw the rituals in the book of Cagliostro.

769
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:27,650
看來你知道
So, you know.

770
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:29,750
法事給了我
The ritual gives me the power

771
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:33,080
打倒古一  拆毀圣殿的力量
to overthrow the Ancient One and tear her Sanctums down,

772
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,560
好讓黑暗次元進來
to let the Dark Dimension in.

773
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:39,520
因為古一私藏的  多瑪姆會無私給予
Because what the Ancient One hoards, Dormammu gives freely.

774
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:42,360
生命  永生
Life, everlasting.

775
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:45,190
他不是世界的毀滅者  博士
He is not the destroyer of worlds, Doctor,

776
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:47,510
而是世界的拯救者
he is the savior of worlds.

777
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:50,970
不  拜托  看看你的臉
No. I mean, come on. Look at your face.

778
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:53,250
多瑪姆把你變成了兇手
Dormammu made you a murderer.

779
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,730
他的王國又能好到哪去
Just how good can his kingdom be?

780
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,560
你覺得這很有趣
You think that's funny?

781
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:01,540
不是因為那個
No. Not that.

782
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:04,660
有趣的是  你的懸戒丟了
What's funny is that you've lost your sling ring.

783
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:13,730
先生  要幫忙嗎
Sir, can I help you?

784
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:15,180
帕爾默醫生  她在哪
Dr. Palmer, where is she?

785
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,760
-先生  我們得...  -她在哪
- Sir, we need to get... - Where is she?

786
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:17,890
在護士站
The nurses station.

787
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:19,540
克里斯汀
Christine!

788
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:22,440
斯蒂芬
Stephen?

789
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:23,730
天啊  怎么
Oh my god. What...

790
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:26,300
你得馬上帶我找個手術室  就你一個人
You need to get me in an operating theater now. Just you.

791
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:27,970
快  我沒時間了
Now! I haven't any time!

792
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,210
-怎么了  -被刺了
- What happened? - I was stabbed.

793
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:31,990
心臟填塞
Cardiac tamponade.

794
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:34,770
你穿的是什么
What are you wearing?

795
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:42,250
胸腔沒問題
Chest cavity is clear.

796
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:46,460
不  血液  積在圍心囊
No, the blood... is in the pericardial sac.

797
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,840
不不不
No. No no no no no no no!

798
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:50,880
斯蒂芬  斯蒂芬
Stephen! Stephen!

799
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:53,120
撐住  撐住
Come on. Come on.

800
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:20,730
再往上一點
Just a little higher.

801
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:24,160
小心針頭
Please be careful with the needle.

802
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:26,960
斯蒂芬
Stephen?

803
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,580
-這是什么  -我的魂體
- What am I seeing? - My astral body.

804
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,100
你死了嗎
Are you dead?

805
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:37,210
不  克里斯汀  但我要死了
No, Christine, but I am dying.

806
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:39,910
對了
Right.

807
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:41,380
好吧
Right.

808
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:44,990
好  好吧
Yeah. All right. Okay.

809
01:07:55,210 --> 01:07:57,340
我從沒見過這樣的傷口
I've never seen a wound like this.

810
01:07:57,670 --> 01:07:58,980
你被什么刺傷了
What were you stabbed with?

811
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:00,450
我不知道
I don't know.

812
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:23,590
-我現在得消失了  -什么
- I'm gonna have to vanish now. - No, what?

813
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,100
別讓我死  好嗎
Keep me alive, will you?

814
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,200
好
Okay!

815
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:30,530
好
Okay.

816
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,040
糟了
Oh shit!

817
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:28,350
{\an8}{\pos(183,167)}充電至200焦

818
01:09:33,690 --> 01:09:34,810
醒醒  醒醒
Come on, come on.

819
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:41,000
斯蒂芬  醒醒
Stephen, come on.

820
01:09:43,770 --> 01:09:44,810
再電我一次
Hit me again!

821
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:47,060
別這樣
Stop doing that!

822
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:48,650
提高電壓  再電我一次
Up the voltage and hit me again.

823
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:50,600
-不  你的心臟跳了  -照做吧
- No, your heart is beating! - Just do it!

824
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:54,180
天啊
Oh my God.

825
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:00,300
{\an8}{\pos(193,177)}充電至360焦

826
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:00,750
{\an8}{\pos(188,167)}不要碰觸病人  按電擊鍵

827
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:24,730
天啊
Oh god! Oh god!

828
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:26,780
-你沒事吧  -嗯
- Are you ok? - Yeah.

829
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:28,890
好了
Okay.

830
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:38,650
過了這么久  你突然出現
After all this time, you just show up here,

831
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:42,190
魂體飛出身體
flying out of your body?

832
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:43,700
我知道
Yeah, I know.

833
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:46,270
我也想你
I missed you too, by the way.

834
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:50,790
我給你發了郵件  你從來不回
I wrote you emails, but you never responded.

835
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:51,690
為什么要回
Why would I?

836
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:55,430
克里斯汀  我太抱歉了
Christine, I am so, so sorry.

837
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:57,850
我為一切道歉  你說得對
For all of it. I mean, you were right,

838
01:10:57,850 --> 01:11:02,090
我是個徹頭徹尾的混蛋  我對你太不好了
I was a complete asshole. I treated you so horribly

839
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:04,340
你應得到更好的對待
and you deserved so much more.

840
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:06,940
別說了  你顯然是受驚了
Stop. You... you're clearly in shock.

841
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:09,960
到底怎么回事
I mean, what the hell is happening?

842
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:11,840
你去哪了
Where have you been?

843
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:15,730
西藥沒能治好我后
Well, after Western medicine failed me,

844
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:19,220
我去了東方  最終來到加德滿都
I headed East, and I ended up in Kathmandu.

845
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:20,860
-加德滿都  -對
- Kathmandu? - Yeah.

846
01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:23,760
鮑勃·西格歌里唱的那個
What, like the Bob Seger song?

847
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,330
1975年的《美麗失意者》A面
1975, Beautiful Loser, side A. Yeah.

848
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:28,490
然后我去了一個叫卡馬塔奇的地方
And then, I went to a place called Kamar-Taj

849
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:31,260
跟一位叫古一法師的人
and I talked to someone

850
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,790
聊了聊  然后
called the Ancient One, and...

851
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:36,560
-所以你加入了邪教  -不是
- So you joined a cult. - No, I didn't.

852
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,280
不算是
Not exactly. No. I mean,

853
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:40,010
他們確實教我挖掘
they did teach me to tap into powers

854
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:41,560
我之前聞所未聞的能量
that I never even knew existed.

855
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:44,000
-聽起來就像是邪教  -不是邪教
- Yeah, that sounds like a cult. - It's not a cult.

856
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,650
-邪教徒就會這么說  -不
- Well, that's what a cultist would say. - Oh, no.

857
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,630
等等  斯蒂芬
Wait, Stephen, wait.

858
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:50,070
你想做什么
What do you think you're doing?

859
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:51,440
邪教集會我要遲到了
I'm late for a cult meeting.

860
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:57,450
-簡直是瘋了  -是啊
- This is insane. - Yeah.

861
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,160
你要去哪
Where are you going?

862
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:01,870
你能跟我說實話嗎
Can you tell me the truth?

863
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:04,600
一位強大的魔法師
Well, a powerful sorcerer,

864
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,260
把自己獻給了一個遠古實體
who gave himself over to an ancient entity

865
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:07,630
他能打破物理法則
Can bend the very laws of physics,

866
01:12:07,630 --> 01:12:09,040
還拼命想殺了我
tried very hard to kill me,

867
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,800
但我把他銬在格林尼治村了
but I left him chained up in Greenwich Village,

868
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,070
回到那個地方最快的辦法是走傳送門
and the quickest way back there is through a dimensional gateway

869
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:14,490
我在清潔間開了一個
that I opened up in the mop closet.

870
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:16,310
好吧  不說算了
Okay. Don't tell me. Fine.

871
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:28,560
我真的得走了
Really do have to go.

872
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:17,560
斯特蘭奇
Strange!

873
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:21,390
你沒事
You're okay.

874
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:24,170
相對而言  是的  我沒事
A relative term, but yeah, I'm okay.

875
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:26,360
懸浮斗篷
The Cloak of Levitation.

876
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:28,800
它找上你了
It came to you.

877
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:31,100
了不起
No minor feat.

878
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:33,570
它可花心了
It's a fickle thing.

879
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:34,840
他逃走了
He's escaped.

880
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:36,490
-卡西利亞斯  -對
- Kaecilius? - Yeah.

881
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,990
他能隨意折疊空間和物質
He can fold space and matter at will.

882
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:43,340
他能在鏡像次元外折疊物質
He folds matter outside the mirror dimension?

883
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:45,480
-在真實世界中  -對
- In the real world? - Yeah.

884
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:47,670
-還有幾個  -兩個
- How many more? - Two.

885
01:13:48,830 --> 01:13:50,440
我把一個丟在了沙漠里
I stranded one in the desert.

886
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:53,290
-另一個呢  -他的尸體就在大廳里
- And the other? - His body's in the hall.

887
01:13:53,770 --> 01:13:55,430
多拉姆法師在門廳里
Master Drumm is in the foyer.

888
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,490
他被帶回卡馬塔奇了
He's been taken back to Kamar-Taj.

889
01:13:57,490 --> 01:13:59,120
倫敦圣殿淪陷了
The London Sanctum has fallen.

890
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,380
只剩下紐約和香港的
Only New York and Hong Kong remain now

891
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:03,390
來抵御黑暗次元
to shield us from the Dark Dimension.

892
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,100
你保衛了遭受襲擊的紐約圣殿
You defended the New York Sanctum from attack.

893
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,340
這里的法師走了  需要一位新的
With its Master gone, it needs another,

894
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:10,970
斯特蘭奇法師
Master Strange.

895
01:14:13,930 --> 01:14:14,770
不
No.

896
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:17,940
我是斯特蘭奇博士
It is Dr. Strange.

897
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:20,540
不是斯特蘭奇法師[碩士]或斯特蘭奇先生
Not Master Strange, not Mr. Strange,

898
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,450
是斯特蘭奇博士
Doctor Strange.

899
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,080
我成為醫生時  曾發誓不傷害他人
When I became a doctor, I swore an oath to do no harm.

900
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,900
而我剛剛就殺了一個人  我不會做第二次了
And I have just killed a man! I'm not doing that again.

901
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,920
我當醫生是為了救人而非殺人
I became a doctor to save lives, not take them.

902
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:36,640
你當醫生主要是為了救一條生命
You become a doctor to save one life above all others.

903
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:37,790
你自己的
Your own.

904
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:40,620
還是能看穿我  是吧
Still seeing through me, are you?

905
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:42,360
我看到的是我一直所見的
I see what I've always seen.

906
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:44,700
你過于膨脹的自我
Your overinflated ego.

907
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:48,180
你想回到之前  你能夠掌控一切的妄想
You want to go back to the delusion that you can control anything,

908
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:49,650
甚至掌控死亡
even death,

909
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:51,400
然而沒人能控制死亡
which no one can control.

910
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:54,410
偉大的斯蒂芬·斯特蘭奇博士也不行
Not even the great doctor Stephen Strange.

911
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:56,300
多瑪姆也不行
Not even Dormammu?

912
01:14:58,190 --> 01:14:59,760
他能讓人永生
He offers immortality.

913
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:02,500
正是我們對死亡的恐懼給了多瑪姆生命
It's our fear of death that gives Dormammu life.

914
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:05,370
-他以此為食  -正如你以他為食
- He feeds off it. - Like you feed on him?

915
01:15:06,390 --> 01:15:07,890
你跟我說掌控死亡
You talk to me about controlling death.

916
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:09,000
我知道你是怎么做的
Well, I know how you do it.

917
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,070
我看過了《卡里奧斯特羅之書》里缺失的法事
I've seen the missing rituals from the book of Cagliostro.

918
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:16,170
千萬當心你接下來要說的話  博士
Measure your next words very carefully, doctor.

919
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,320
因為你可能不喜歡聽嗎
Because you might not like them?

920
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:21,080
因為你可能不知道你在說什么
Because you may not know of what you speak.

921
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:24,270
-他在說什么  -我在說她的長命
- What is he talking about? - I'm talking about her long life.

922
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,990
她不死的緣由
The source of her immortality.

923
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:31,090
她從黑暗次元汲取能量來維持生命
She draws power from the Dark Dimension to stay alive.

924
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:34,560
那不是真的
That's not true.

925
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:36,940
我見過那些法事  想明白了
I've seen the rituals, worked them out.

926
01:15:37,890 --> 01:15:39,110
我知道你是怎么做的
I know how you do it.

927
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,950
等他們重組  狂熱信徒就會回來
Once they regroup, the zealots will be back.

928
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,230
你們會需要支援
You'll need reinforcements.

929
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:55,760
她不是你以為的那樣
She is not who you think she is.

930
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,380
你沒資格那么說
You don't have the right to say that.

931
01:15:58,010 --> 01:16:00,470
你不知道她肩上擔負的責任
You've no idea the responsibility that rests upon her shoulders.

932
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:02,310
對  我也不想知道
No, and I don't want to know.

933
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,250
-你是個懦夫  -因為我不是個殺手嗎
- You're a coward. - Because I'm not a killer?

934
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:07,120
狂熱信徒會把我們統統消滅
These zealots will snuff us all out,

935
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,720
而你卻不能振作起來  先消滅他們
and you can't muster the strength to snuff them first?

936
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:13,060
-你以為我剛剛做了什么  -你救了你自己
- What do you think I just did? - You saved your own life!

937
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:16,590
然后像只受傷的狗一樣不停抱怨
And then whined about it like a wounded dog.

938
01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:17,990
而你就能輕松做到嗎
You would have done it so easily?

939
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,310
你無法想象
You've no idea,

940
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:21,150
我做過的事
the things I've done...

941
01:16:22,610 --> 01:16:23,980
答案是沒錯
And the answer is yes.

942
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:28,020
-毫不猶豫  -即使還有別的辦法
- Without hesitation. - Even if there's another way?

943
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:31,430
-沒有別的辦法  -是你缺乏想象力
- There is no other way. - You lack imagination.

944
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:32,880
不  斯蒂芬
No, Stephen.

945
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:36,530
是你缺少骨氣
You lack a spine.

946
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:42,600
他們回來了
They're back.

947
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:50,700
我們得了結此事
We have to end this.

948
01:16:50,970 --> 01:16:51,700
快
Now!

949
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:00,140
斯特蘭奇  下來戰斗
Strange! Get down here and fight!

950
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:01,890
不要
No.

951
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:07,840
鏡像次元
The Mirror Dimension.

952
01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:10,430
你在這里無法影響真實世界
You can't affect the real world in here.

953
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:13,680
現在是誰得意呢  混蛋
Who's laughing now, asshole?

954
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:16,980
是我
I am.

955
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:32,830
我拿了他的懸戒  他們跑不了的  對吧
I've got his sling ring. I mean, they can't escape, right?

956
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:34,880
快跑
Run!

957
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,000
他們與黑暗次元的聯系
Their connection to the Dark Dimension

958
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,270
使他們在鏡像次元里更為強大
makes them more powerful in the Mirror Dimension.

959
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:58,620
他們不能影響真實世界  但還是能殺了我們
They can't affect the real world, but they can still kill us.

960
01:17:58,630 --> 01:17:59,950
這并不明智
This wasn't cleverness.

961
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:01,770
這是自殺
It was suicide!

962
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:20,170
真好笑
That is hilarious.

963
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:08,050
這是個錯誤
This was a mistake.

964
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:42,000
是真的
It's true.

965
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,970
她真的從黑暗次元汲取能量
She does draw power from the Dark Dimension.

966
01:20:49,770 --> 01:20:51,150
卡西利亞斯
Kaecilius.

967
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:54,960
我投奔你時
I came to you,

968
01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:56,690
心碎
broken,

969
01:20:56,690 --> 01:20:57,920
迷失
lost,

970
01:20:58,010 --> 01:20:58,890
需要幫助
in need.

971
01:20:58,890 --> 01:21:02,760
我信任你做我的導師  你卻滿口謊言
Trusted you to be my teacher, and you fed me lies.

972
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:04,370
我是想保護你
I tried to protect you.

973
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:06,640
-真相會傷害我嗎  -你自己會
- From the truth? - From yourself.

974
01:21:06,850 --> 01:21:08,370
如今我有新導師了
I have a new teacher now.

975
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:10,800
多瑪姆在欺騙你
Dormammu deceives you.

976
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:14,210
你不知道他的真面目
You have no idea what he truly is.

977
01:21:14,230 --> 01:21:18,130
他所謂的永生并非天堂  而是無盡的煎熬
His eternal life is not paradise, but torment.

978
01:21:18,130 --> 01:21:19,090
騙子
Liar.

979
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:16,660
克里斯汀
Christine!

980
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:18,370
開什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

981
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,440
我的天
Oh my god.

982
01:22:23,410 --> 01:22:25,550
不是心房顫動  她心肌頓抑
It's not fibrillation. She has a stunned myocardium.

983
01:22:25,550 --> 01:22:26,660
-神經性休克嗎  -對
- Neurogenic? - Yes.

984
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:33,370
拿棉簽
Someone get the swabs.

985
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:37,080
尼克
Nic?

986
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,750
我們得降低她的腦壓
We need to relieve the pressure on her brain.

987
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:45,970
她心率在下降
She's still dropping.

988
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:47,450
她快不行了
We're losing her!

989
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:48,720
得給她加氧
We need to increase her oxygen!

990
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:51,020
-急救車推過來  -她的瞳孔放大了
- I need a crash cart! - Her pupils have dilated!

991
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:54,330
無反射能力  也讀不到腦部活動了
No reflexes. We're not reading any brain activity.

992
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:07,300
你在做什么
What are you doing?

993
01:23:08,610 --> 01:23:09,920
別這樣  你快死了
Come on. You're dying!

994
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:21,520
你得馬上回到身體里  你沒時間了
You have to return to your body now. You don't have time.

995
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:25,620
時間是相對的  你的身體還沒倒地呢
Time is relative. Your body hasn't even hit the floor yet.

996
01:23:27,610 --> 01:23:31,200
我花了太多歲月窺視未來
I've spent so many years peering through time,

997
01:23:31,490 --> 01:23:33,690
看這一刻
looking at this exact moment.

998
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:35,430
卻看不到之后
But I can't see past it.

999
01:23:36,210 --> 01:23:39,410
我阻止了無數種可怕的未來
I've prevented countless terrible futures.

1000
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,990
一次接著一次  永無休止
And after each one, there's always another.

1001
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:44,160
都將我帶到這一刻
And they all lead here,

1002
01:23:44,990 --> 01:23:45,930
但也止于這一刻
but never further.

1003
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:47,840
你覺得自己死于這一刻
You think this is where you die.

1004
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:51,170
想知道我在你的未來看到什么嗎
You wonder what I see in your future?

1005
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:52,590
不想
No.

1006
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:55,650
想
Yes.

1007
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:59,650
我從未看到過你的未來  只能看到其可能性
I never saw your future. Only its possibilities.

1008
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:03,280
你有行大善的能力
You have such a capacity for goodness.

1009
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,110
你總是很出眾
You always excelled,

1010
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:07,150
但并非因為你渴望成功
but not because you crave success,

1011
01:24:07,890 --> 01:24:10,030
而是因為你害怕失敗
but because of your fear of failure.

1012
01:24:10,410 --> 01:24:12,180
正因此我才是一位優秀的醫生
That's what made me a great doctor.

1013
01:24:12,430 --> 01:24:15,120
正因此你無法成就偉業
It's precisely what kept you from greatness.

1014
01:24:16,110 --> 01:24:18,270
傲慢和恐懼仍絆著你
Arrogance and fear still keep you

1015
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:21,510
讓你無法學會最簡單也最重要的一課
from learning the simplest and most significant lesson of all.

1016
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:22,880
是什么
Which is?

1017
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:27,010
你并不重要
It's not about you.

1018
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:32,210
你第一次來找我時
When you first came to me,

1019
01:24:32,210 --> 01:24:35,700
問我是如何治愈了喬納森·潘伯恩
you asked me how I was able to heal Jonathan Pangborn.

1020
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:37,800
我沒有
I didn't.

1021
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:43,780
他將次元能量引入體內
He channels dimensional energy directly into his own body.

1022
01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:47,450
-他靠魔法行走  -時刻如此
- He uses magic to walk. - Constantly.

1023
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:49,670
他可以選擇
He had a choice,

1024
01:24:50,470 --> 01:24:52,540
是回到原來的生活
to return to his own life

1025
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,180
還是為比小我更偉大的事業做貢獻
or to serve something greater than himself.

1026
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:57,350
所以我的手能復原嗎
So, I could have my hands back again?

1027
01:24:58,120 --> 01:24:59,470
我能回到從前的生活嗎
My old life?

1028
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:01,400
可以
You could.

1029
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:05,340
而世界會因此變得更加危險
And the world would be all the lesser for it.

1030
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:09,840
我厭惡從黑暗次元汲取能量
I've hated drawing power from the Dark Dimension.

1031
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:11,370
但你知道
But as you well know,

1032
01:25:11,370 --> 01:25:13,870
人有時必須打破規則
sometimes one must break the rules

1033
01:25:13,870 --> 01:25:15,750
才能夠成就偉大的事業
in order to serve the greater good.

1034
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,480
莫多不會這么覺得
Mordo won't see it that way.

1035
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,520
莫多的靈魂剛強不屈
Mordo's soul is rigid and unmovable,

1036
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:23,000
那是他青春的火焰鍛造的品性
forged by the fires of his youth.

1037
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:26,990
他需要你的變通  就像你需要他的力量
He needs your flexibility, just as you need his strength.

1038
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:31,950
你們只有共同努力  才有希望阻止多瑪姆
Only together do you stand a chance of stopping Dormammu.

1039
01:25:32,230 --> 01:25:33,320
我還沒準備好
I'm not ready.

1040
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,310
沒人會準備好
No one ever is.

1041
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:40,960
時機由不得我們選
We don't get to choose our time.

1042
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:47,270
是死亡賦予了生命意義
Death is what gives life meaning.

1043
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:50,750
知道自己生命有限
To know your days are numbered,

1044
01:25:51,170 --> 01:25:52,900
人生苦短
your time is short.

1045
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:57,440
按說都這么久了  我應該準備好了
You'd think after all this time I'd be ready.

1046
01:25:58,420 --> 01:25:59,500
但你看看我
But look at me,

1047
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:03,000
無限延長片刻時間
stretching one moment out into a thousand,

1048
01:26:03,370 --> 01:26:05,640
就為了看雪景
just so that I can watch the snow.

1049
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:45,770
你還好嗎
Are you okay?

1050
01:26:53,810 --> 01:26:57,030
-我不明白是怎么回事  -我知道
- I don't understand what's happening. - I know.

1051
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:00,990
但我得走了
But I have to go away now.

1052
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:08,450
你曾說失去我的手未必是末路
You said that losing my hands didn't have to be the end,

1053
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:10,090
也可以是開端
that it could be a beginning.

1054
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:11,440
對
Yeah.

1055
01:27:13,170 --> 01:27:15,780
因為還有其他方式可以拯救生命
Because there are other ways to save lives.

1056
01:27:18,970 --> 01:27:20,350
更艱難的方式
A harder way.

1057
01:27:22,830 --> 01:27:24,470
更怪異的方式
A weirder way.

1058
01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:28,610
帕爾默醫生  請前往急診室
Dr. Palmer, to the ER, please. Dr. Palmer, to the ER.

1059
01:27:32,950 --> 01:27:34,600
我不希望你走
I don't want you to go.

1060
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:24,040
停下
Stop.

1061
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:32,610
{\an8}{\pos(192.5,159)}香港

1062
01:28:53,990 --> 01:28:55,460
好好選擇武器
Choose your weapon wisely.

1063
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:01,230
誰都別想闖進圣殿
No one steps foot in this Sanctum.

1064
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:04,730
誰都別想
No one.

1065
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:21,890
卡西利亞斯
Kaecilius.

1066
01:29:22,310 --> 01:29:24,510
你站錯了隊  王
You're on the wrong side of history, Wong.

1067
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:40,090
-她死了  -你是對的
- She's dead. - You were right.

1068
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:43,530
她并不是我以為的那樣
She wasn't who I thought she was.

1069
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:45,870
她很復雜
She was complicated.

1070
01:29:50,790 --> 01:29:52,120
復雜
Complicated?

1071
01:29:55,570 --> 01:29:57,540
黑暗次元不穩定
The Dark Dimension is volatile.

1072
01:29:57,910 --> 01:29:58,980
危險
Dangerous.

1073
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:01,570
如果她被控制了呢
What if it overtook her?

1074
01:30:03,230 --> 01:30:05,400
她教導我們那是禁忌
She taught us it was forbidden,

1075
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:10,160
她自己卻汲取其能量  來盜取數世紀的壽命
while she drew on its power to steal centuries of life.

1076
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:12,130
她做了她以為正確的事
She did what she thought was right.

1077
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:14,030
代價終究會來
The bill comes due.

1078
01:30:15,130 --> 01:30:16,240
你還不明白嗎
Don't you see?

1079
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:21,130
她的犯忌導致狂熱信徒投向多瑪姆
Her transgressions led the zealots to Dormammu.

1080
01:30:21,130 --> 01:30:22,520
卡西利亞斯
Kaecilius

1081
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,400
是她的錯
was her fault.

1082
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:29,330
而我們現在  就在面對她欺瞞的后果
And here we are, in the consequence of her deception.

1083
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:33,800
浴火的世界
A world on fire.

1084
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,850
莫多  倫敦圣殿已經淪陷
Mordo,London Sanctum has fallen.

1085
01:30:36,450 --> 01:30:38,360
紐約圣殿也兩次遭到襲擊
The New York one has been attacked. Twice.

1086
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:40,070
你清楚他們接下來要去哪
You know where they're going next.

1087
01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:41,740
香港
Hong Kong.

1088
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:44,190
你曾叫我戰斗  就好像我命系于此
You told me once to fight like my life depended on it,

1089
01:30:44,190 --> 01:30:45,360
因為有一天  或許真會如此
because one day, it might.

1090
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,880
那一天已經到來
Well, today is that day.

1091
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:49,620
我不能一個人打敗他們
I cannot defeat them alone.

1092
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,020
圣殿已經淪陷
The Sanctum's already fallen.

1093
01:31:16,850 --> 01:31:18,300
黑暗次元
The Dark Dimension.

1094
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:22,150
多瑪姆來了
Dormammu is coming.

1095
01:31:24,330 --> 01:31:25,690
太遲了
It's too late.

1096
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,420
沒有什么能阻止他了
Nothing can stop him.

1097
01:31:29,490 --> 01:31:30,890
未必
Not necessarily.

1098
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:36,130
不
No.

1099
01:32:17,730 --> 01:32:18,840
咒語起效了
The spell's working.

1100
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:22,300
我們有第二次機會
We've got a second chance.

1101
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:04,680
不
No!

1102
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:14,270
王
Wong!

1103
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:25,390
打破自然法則  我知道
Breaking the laws of nature, I know.

1104
01:34:27,310 --> 01:34:28,500
別現在停下
Well, don't stop now.

1105
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:31,800
等圣殿復原
When the Sanctum is restored,

1106
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,080
他們會再次發起攻擊  我們得守住
they'll attack it again. We've gotta defend it.

1107
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:34,970
走吧
Come on!

1108
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:06,350
起來  斯特蘭奇  起來戰斗
Get up, Strange. Get up and fight!

1109
01:35:07,170 --> 01:35:08,620
我們可以做個了結
We can finish this.

1110
01:35:09,700 --> 01:35:11,390
你無法抵抗不可避免之事
You can't fight the inevitable.

1111
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:16,390
多美啊
Isn't it beautiful?

1112
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:20,500
超越時間的世界
A world beyond time.

1113
01:35:23,370 --> 01:35:24,680
超越死亡
Beyond death.

1114
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:30,200
超越時間
Beyond time...

1115
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:31,630
斯特蘭奇
Strange!

1116
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:05,270
他走了
He's gone.

1117
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:09,850
就連斯特蘭奇也拋下你們  屈服于他的力量
Even Strange has left you and surrendered to his power.

1118
01:36:42,110 --> 01:36:44,770
多瑪姆  我來談條件
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

1119
01:36:44,770 --> 01:36:48,190
你是來受死的
You've come to die.

1120
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:52,460
你的世界現在是我的了
Your world is now my world,

1121
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:55,650
就像所有世界一樣
like all worlds.

1122
01:37:25,050 --> 01:37:28,180
多瑪姆  我來談條件
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

1123
01:37:28,580 --> 01:37:31,410
你是來受死的
You've come to die.

1124
01:37:31,810 --> 01:37:34,870
你的世界現在是我的了...
Your world is now my...

1125
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:37,250
這怎么回事
What is this?

1126
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,210
幻覺嗎
Illusion?

1127
01:37:39,330 --> 01:37:42,430
-不  是真的  -那就好
- No, this is real. - Good.

1128
01:37:52,530 --> 01:37:55,110
多瑪姆  我來談條件
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

1129
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:58,620
你...怎么回事
You've... what is happening?

1130
01:37:59,590 --> 01:38:02,350
就像你給卡西利亞斯你的次元的力量
Just as you gave Kaecilius powers from your dimension,

1131
01:38:02,350 --> 01:38:04,650
我也從我的世界帶來了一份力量
I brought a little power from mine.

1132
01:38:05,390 --> 01:38:07,660
這是時間
This is time.

1133
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:11,380
無盡循環的時間
Endless looped time.

1134
01:38:11,860 --> 01:38:14,430
你好大膽
You dare!

1135
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:16,040
該死...
Oh, fu...

1136
01:38:17,330 --> 01:38:19,330
多瑪姆  我來談條件
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

1137
01:38:20,450 --> 01:38:22,560
你不能永遠這么做
You cannot do this forever.

1138
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:24,340
其實  我能
Actually, I can.

1139
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,720
現在就這樣了
This is how things are now.

1140
01:38:27,410 --> 01:38:31,870
你和我  困在這一刻里  無窮無盡
You and me, trapped in this moment, endlessly.

1141
01:38:31,870 --> 01:38:35,430
那你就永生永世地死吧
Then you will spend eternity dying.

1142
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:39,270
是啊  但地球上的人都能得以存活
Yes. But everyone on Earth will live.

1143
01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:40,980
但你會受盡折磨
But you will suffer.

1144
01:38:41,820 --> 01:38:43,490
痛苦跟我很熟了
Pain's an old friend.

1145
01:38:46,190 --> 01:38:47,220
多瑪姆
Dormammu!

1146
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:50,540
-我來談條件  -停下
- I've come to bargain. - End this!

1147
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:51,330
多瑪姆
Dormammu!

1148
01:38:51,330 --> 01:38:52,110
多瑪姆
Dormammu!

1149
01:38:52,110 --> 01:38:53,210
多瑪姆
Dormammu!

1150
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:11,960
你永遠不會贏的
You will never win.

1151
01:39:13,570 --> 01:39:14,630
是啊
No...

1152
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:16,880
但我可以輸
But I can lose.

1153
01:39:17,710 --> 01:39:18,810
一遍
Again,

1154
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:20,400
又一遍
and again,

1155
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:22,380
無窮
and again,

1156
01:39:22,870 --> 01:39:24,600
無盡  直到永遠
and again, forever.

1157
01:39:26,470 --> 01:39:29,580
-那樣你就是我的囚徒  -不
- And that makes you my prisoner. - No.

1158
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:30,850
停下
Stop!

1159
01:39:31,110 --> 01:39:33,610
停下來
Make this stop!!!

1160
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:36,210
放了我
Set me free!

1161
01:39:36,930 --> 01:39:37,940
不
No.

1162
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:40,210
我來談條件
I've come to bargain.

1163
01:39:42,090 --> 01:39:44,420
你想要什么
What do you want?

1164
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:48,440
把你的狂熱信徒從地球上帶走
Take your zealots from the Earth.

1165
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,120
結束你對我的世界的襲擊
End your assault on my world.

1166
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:53,170
永遠別回來
Never come back.

1167
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:56,670
照做  我就結束循環
Do it, and I'll break the loop.

1168
01:40:06,850 --> 01:40:08,130
起來  斯特蘭奇
Get up, Strange.

1169
01:40:08,220 --> 01:40:09,540
起來戰斗
Get up and fight!

1170
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:11,610
我們可以做個了結
We can finish this.

1171
01:40:12,270 --> 01:40:13,640
多美啊
Isn't it beautiful?

1172
01:40:15,590 --> 01:40:17,670
超越時間的世界
A world beyond time.

1173
01:40:20,590 --> 01:40:21,840
超越死亡
Beyond death.

1174
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:36,760
-你做了什么  -我談妥了條件
- What have you done? - I made a bargain.

1175
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:41,400
這是怎么回事
What is this?

1176
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:42,990
這是
Well, it's,

1177
01:40:42,990 --> 01:40:44,750
你想要的一切
it's everything you've ever wanted.

1178
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:48,060
永生  成為唯一的一部分
Eternal life as part of the One.

1179
01:40:50,830 --> 01:40:52,810
你不會喜歡的
You're not gonna like it.

1180
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:14,670
你真該把整本書偷走的
You know, you really should have stolen the whole book,

1181
01:41:14,670 --> 01:41:16,200
因為警告
because the warnings...

1182
01:41:16,910 --> 01:41:19,420
警告是寫在咒語后面的
the warnings come after the spells.

1183
01:41:29,370 --> 01:41:30,650
真好笑
That's funny.

1184
01:41:57,840 --> 01:41:58,880
我們成功了
We did it.

1185
01:42:01,890 --> 01:42:03,000
是啊
Yes.

1186
01:42:03,790 --> 01:42:05,190
我們成功了
Yes, we did it.

1187
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:09,870
也是靠違反自然法則
By also violating the natural laws.

1188
01:42:10,670 --> 01:42:12,880
看看你周圍  都結束了
Look around you. It's over.

1189
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:16,410
你還是覺得不會產生后果嗎  斯特蘭奇
You still think there will be no consequences, Strange?

1190
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:19,300
不會有代價
No price to pay?

1191
01:42:19,940 --> 01:42:22,870
我們跟她一樣  打破了法則
We broke our rules, just like her.

1192
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:27,510
代價終究會來
The bill comes due.

1193
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:29,730
總會來的
Always.

1194
01:42:30,430 --> 01:42:31,630
總有清算的一天
A reckoning.

1195
01:42:34,730 --> 01:42:37,170
我不會再走這條路了
I will follow this path no longer.

1196
01:43:11,450 --> 01:43:12,920
好吧
Yeah, okay.

1197
01:43:22,210 --> 01:43:23,630
明智之舉
Wise choice.

1198
01:43:24,350 --> 01:43:26,320
你今后還會有機會戴阿戈摩托之眼
You'll wear the eye of Agamotto

1199
01:43:26,370 --> 01:43:28,310
等你掌握其法力之后
once you've mastered its powers.

1200
01:43:28,790 --> 01:43:29,930
在那之前
Until then,

1201
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,010
最好別戴著無限寶石滿街亂跑
best not to walk the streets wearing an infinity stone.

1202
01:43:34,010 --> 01:43:35,100
什么
A what?

1203
01:43:36,170 --> 01:43:38,010
你或許有魔法天賦
You might have a gift for the mystic arts,

1204
01:43:38,010 --> 01:43:40,130
但你還有很多要學
but you still have much to learn.

1205
01:43:41,610 --> 01:43:43,100
古一法師的死
Word of the Ancient One's death

1206
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:45,170
很快將在多元宇宙里傳開
will spread through the multiverse.

1207
01:43:45,450 --> 01:43:48,330
地球沒有至尊法師維護了
Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme to defend it.

1208
01:43:48,590 --> 01:43:50,600
-我們必須做好準備  -我們會的
- We must be ready. - We'll be ready.

1209
01:46:29,190 --> 01:46:32,440
{\an8}{\pos(192,175)}奇異博士

1210
01:46:32,230 --> 01:46:35,740
{\an8}奇異博士

1211
01:46:37,390 --> 01:46:40,690
地球上現在還有魔法師了
So, Earth has wizards now, huh?

1212
01:46:42,510 --> 01:46:43,520
喝茶嗎
Tea?

1213
01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:45,610
我不喝茶
I don't drink tea.

1214
01:46:45,610 --> 01:46:46,960
你喝什么
What do you drink?

1215
01:46:47,850 --> 01:46:49,100
不喝茶
Not tea.

1216
01:46:52,550 --> 01:46:55,600
我有一份關注名單  都是來自
So, I keep a watchlist of individuals and beings

1217
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:58,250
其他世界  可能對這個世界構成威脅的人
from other realms that may be a threat to this world.

1218
01:46:58,250 --> 01:47:01,940
你的領養弟弟  洛基  就是其中之一
Your adopted brother, Loki, is one of those beings.

1219
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,580
-的確該加上他  -嗯
- Worthy inclusion. - Yeah.

1220
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:11,580
為什么帶他來紐約
So, why bring him here to New York?

1221
01:47:11,580 --> 01:47:13,530
這說來話長
It's a bit of a long story.

1222
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:15,970
家庭鬧劇  之類的
Family drama, that kind of thing, but...

1223
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,500
我們在找我父親
we're looking for my father.

1224
01:47:18,290 --> 01:47:20,870
好吧  如果你們找到了奧丁
Oh, okay. So, if you found Odin,

1225
01:47:20,870 --> 01:47:24,740
你們都會馬上回阿斯加德嗎
you'd all return to Asgard, promptly?

1226
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:26,190
是的  馬上
Oh, yes. Promptly.

1227
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:27,570
太好了
Great.

1228
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,390
我來幫你吧
Allow me to help you.

1229
01:53:31,740 --> 01:53:32,820
有事嗎
Can I help you?

1230
01:53:34,090 --> 01:53:37,110
他們拿擔架把你抬去了卡馬塔奇
They carried you into Kamar-Taj on a strecher.

1231
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:40,840
瞧瞧你現在的樣子  潘伯恩
Look at you now. Pangborn.

1232
01:53:42,050 --> 01:53:43,070
莫多
Mordo.

1233
01:53:45,990 --> 01:53:47,700
我能為你做什么  哥們
So, what can I do for you, Man?

1234
01:53:47,820 --> 01:53:51,180
我離開了數月  想通了一件事
I've been away for many months now and I've had a revelation.

1235
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,780
魔法師的真正意圖
The true purpose of a sorcerer

1236
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:57,930
就是扭曲事物應有的形態
is to twist things out of there proper shape.

1237
01:53:58,950 --> 01:54:00,360
盜取能量
Stealing power,

1238
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:02,790
敗壞自然
perverting nature...

1239
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:04,550
就像你
like you.

1240
01:54:05,690 --> 01:54:08,120
我沒偷什么  這是我的力量
I've stolen nothing. This is my power.

1241
01:54:08,910 --> 01:54:09,780
我的
Mine.

1242
01:54:09,780 --> 01:54:10,790
力量
Power...

1243
01:54:12,060 --> 01:54:13,470
是有目的的
has a purpose.

1244
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:29,430
你為什么這么做
Why are you doing this?

1245
01:54:29,950 --> 01:54:33,470
因為我終于明白這世界的問題出在哪了
Because I see at long last what's wrong with the world.

1246
01:54:38,520 --> 01:54:40,430
有太多魔法師
