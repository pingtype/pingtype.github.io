紐約  1970年

11
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,940
什麼聲音
What the fuck is that?

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,800
吉米
Jimmy?

13
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,870
- 什麼事  - 我是不是撞到什麼了
- What's up? - Did I hit something?

14
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,710
到底是什麼
What the fuck is that?

15
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,380
是不是爆胎啦
Maybe you got a flat?

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,140
不是啦
No.

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,090
他媽的  最好停下來看看
What the fuck? You better pull over and see.

18
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,480
他還活著  你他媽的真是人渣
He's still alive. You fucking piece of shit!

19
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,490
去死吧  婊子養的  看著我
Die, you motherfucker! Look at me!

20
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,930
從我有記憶開始  我就想成為黑幫分子
As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster.

27
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,800
對我來說
To me,

28
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,100
成為黑幫分子比當選美國總統還好
being a gangster was better than being president of the United States.

29
00:02:53,576 --> 00:02:55,680
紐約東區  布魯克林  1955年

30
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,180
在我去計程車站找零工之前
Even before I first wandered into the cabstand for an after-school job...

31
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,450
我就知道我要成為他們的一份子
I knew I wanted to be a part of them.

32
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,030
我有種歸屬感
It was there that I knew I belonged.

33
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,690
對我來說是一種成就感  在一個充滿了無名小卒的環境中
To me, it meant being somebody in a neighborhood full of nobodies.

34
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,930
他們不像別人  他們能隨心所欲
They weren't like anybody else. They did whatever they wanted.

35
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,700
他們在消防栓前面停車而從來也不會被開罰單
They double-parked in front of a hydrant, nobody ever gave them a ticket.

36
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,200
夏天通宵賭撲克
In the summer, when they played cards all night...

37
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,500
也沒人敢叫警察
nobody ever called the cops.

38
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,550
東尼·史達斯  你好嗎
Tony Stacks. How are you?

39
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,350
杜迪·西席羅
Tuddy Cicero.

40
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,760
這就是加拿希小子嗎
Could this be the Canarsie Kid?

41
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,920
- 你好嗎  - 蠻好的
- How are you? - Good.

42
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,390
杜迪
Tuddy.

43
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,360
杜迪的大哥保利是整個社區的大老闆
Tuddy ran the cabstand and the Bella Vista Pizzeria...

44
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,170
他替他打理計程車站和貝拉維斯塔披薩屋等地點
and other places for his brother, Paul, who was the boss of the neighborhood.

45
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,080
保利看起來動作很慢
Paulie might have moved slow...

46
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,510
那是因為保利不需要為任何人做事
but it was only because Paulie didn't have to move for anybody.

47
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,790
- 都是你不好  - 是你先開始的
- It's your fault. - You started it.

48
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,990
我先開始的  是你不好
I started it? It's your fault.

49
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,600
起先我父母都很高興我在對街找到一份工作
At first my parents loved that I found a job across the street from the house.

50
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,470
我父親是愛爾蘭人  他十一歲就被送去工作了
My father, who was Irish, was sent to work at the age of 11.

51
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,570
他很高興我找到工作
He liked that I got myself a job.

52
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,270
他常說美國孩子都被慣壞了
He always used to say that American kids were spoiled lazy.

53
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,710
- 爸  再見  - 再見
- Bye, Dad. - Bye.

54
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,550
再見  米奇
See you, Mikey.

55
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,880
再見  亨利
Bye, Henry.

56
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,040
亨利  過馬路要小心呀
Henry! Watch how you cross!

57
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,620
記得帶牛奶回來
Bring back milk!

58
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,920
我媽媽也高興呀  當她知道西席羅家
My mother was happy after she found out that the Ciceros...

59
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,620
和她是從西西里同一個地區出來的  對我媽媽而言
came from the same part of Sicily as she did. To my mother...

60
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,600
就像她的禱告都應驗了
that was the answer to all her prayers.

61
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,500
我是世上最幸運的小孩
I was the luckiest kid in the world.

62
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,500
我可以到任何地方  做任何事
I could go anywhere, I could do anything.

63
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,340
我認識每一個人  大家也都認識我
I knew everybody, and everybody knew me.

64
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,580
兄弟們開車來  杜迪就讓我
Wiseguys would pull up and Tuddy would toss me their keys...

65
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,480
幫他們停凱迪拉克車
and let me park their Cadillacs.

66
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,210
那時候我還是個小鬼
Here I am, this little kid,

67
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,240
坐在方向盤後面  連路都看不見
I can't even see over the steering wheel...

68
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,580
就能停凱迪拉克了
and I'm parking Cadillacs.

69
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,880
可是  沒多久
But it wasn't too long...

70
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,960
我父母就反對我在計程車站的工作了
before my parents changed their minds about my job at the cabstand.

71
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,760
給你媽媽跟妹妹
For your mother and sister.

72
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,230
對他們來說  計程站的工作只是零工  對我
For them, the cabstand was supposed to be a part-time job. But for me...

73
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,370
卻是全天候
it was definitely full-time.

74
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,470
我唯一想做的事
That's all I wanted to do.

75
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,800
像我爸爸這種人永遠也不會瞭解  我是其中的一份子
People like my father could never understand, but I was a part of something.

76
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,780
我有所屬  他們以成人待我
I belonged. I was treated like a grown-up.

77
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,110
告訴他519
Tell him 519.

78
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,280
每天我都在學些有用的技巧
Every day I was learning to score.

79
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,940
這裏一塊錢  那裏一塊錢
A dollar here, a dollar there.

80
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,020
我好像活在夢幻裏
I was living in a fantasy.

81
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,080
今天在學校還順利嗎
Did you have a good day at school?

82
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,060
父親總是非常生氣
My father was always pissed off.

83
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,360
他氣自己賺錢太少
Pissed that he made such lousy money...

84
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,470
他氣弟弟米奇活在輪椅上
pissed that my kid brother Michael was in a wheelchair.

85
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,870
他氣我們一家七口擠在一間小房子裏
He was pissed that there were seven of us living in such a tiny house.

86
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,000
你跟我說說這個
Tell me about this.

87
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,430
是學校來的信
It's a letter from school.

88
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,780
信上說你已經幾個月沒上學了
It says you haven't been there in months.

89
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,380
幾個月了
In months!

90
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,640
你是個沒用的混球
You're a bum!

91
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,910
你長大想做個流浪漢嗎
Want to grow up to be a bum?

92
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,620
過了一陣子之後  他氣我整天泡在計程車站
After a while, he was mostly pissed because I hung around the cabstand.

93
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,690
他知道站裏有些什麼勾當
He knew what went on at that cabstand.

94
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,490
我經常挨揍  可是我已經不在乎了
Every once in a while, I'd have to take a beating. But by then, I didn't care.

95
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,530
就我看來
The way I saw it...

96
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,500
每個人都有挨揍的時候
everybody takes a beating sometime.

97
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,440
- 我不能再送貨了  - 什麼  你這樣會把所有事都搞砸
- I can't make any more deliveries. - What? You'll fuck everything up.

98
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,670
我老爸說他會殺了我  你看
My dad says he'll kill me. Look.

99
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,280
跟我來
Come on with me.

100
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,450
- 那是送信到你家的郵差嗎  - 不是
- Is that him, kid? - No.

101
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,850
- 那一個呢  - 也不是
- How about him? - No.

102
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,880
- 那個就是  - 去找他
- That's the guy. - Get him.

103
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,020
抱歉
Excuse me.

104
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,860
- 人渣  - 你這塊狗屎  給我過來
- Scumbag. - Come here, you piece of shit.

105
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,770
- 認識這個小鬼嗎  - 認得呀
- Know this kid? - Yeah.

106
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,500
- 你知道他住哪裏嗎  - 知道
- Know where he lives? - Yeah.

107
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,910
- 這家的信是由你送的嗎  - 是的
- You deliver mail to his house? - Yeah.

108
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,840
從現在起  任何從學校寄給他家的信都給我
From now on, any letter from that school to his house comes directly here.

109
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,210
- 你懂嗎  - 懂
- Understand? - Yeah.

110
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,940
假如再有一封學校的信送進那小鬼家裏的話
Another letter from that school goes to that kid's house...

111
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,610
你會被塞進烤披薩的爐子裏
in the fucking oven you'll go, head first.

112
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,120
就這樣  再也沒有缺課的來信  再也沒有學校的來信
That was it. No more letters from truant officers. No letters from school.

113
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,350
其實  任何信件都沒有了
In fact, no more letters from anybody.

114
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:36,330
最後  經過幾星期  我媽媽去郵局抱怨了
Finally after a few weeks, my mother went to the post office to complain.

115
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,330
從那以後  我怎麼能回到學校去發誓效忠國旗
How could I go to school after that...

116
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,370
我又怎能坐在那裏聽政府如何好的屁話呢
and pledge allegiance to the flag and sit through good government bullshit?

117
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,870
保利最恨電話了  他不肯在家裏裝電話
Paulie hated phones. He wouldn't have one in his house.

118
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,740
米奇打來了  要不要我回他電話
Mickey called. Want me to call him back?

119
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,710
好吧  打過去
All right, make the call.

120
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,480
他的電話都是由別人傳達給他
He got all his calls second hand. Then you'd have to call the people back...

121
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,680
然後手下再從公用電話回電
from an outside phone.

122
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,350
你有沒有五分錢  幫我打個電話給他
Got a nickel? Get him on the phone.

123
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:06,830
有幾個混混整天就是忙著幫保利接電話
There were guys, that's all they did all day, was take care of Paulie's calls.

124
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,770
對一個整天忙碌不停的人來說  他很少跟人說話
For a guy who moved all day long, Paulie didn't talk to six people.

125
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,940
假如工會有了問題或彩票上有爭議
If there was a union problem or, say, a beef in the numbers...

126
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,570
只有高級幹部可以跟保利商議
only the top guys could meet with Paulie to discuss the problem.

127
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,020
保利討厭開會  凡事都是一對一解決
Everything was one-on-one. Paulie hated conferences.

128
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,220
他不要別人聽到他說的話
He didn't want anybody hearing what he said...

129
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,690
或聽到別人說給他聽的話
and he didn't want anybody listening to what he was being told.

130
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,090
好幾百人以保利當靠山  他們所賺的都給保利一份
Hundreds of guys depended on Paulie, he got a piece of everything they made.

131
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:46,600
那就是保護費  就像在西西里  只不過這是美國
It was a tribute, like in the old country, except they were doing it in America.

132
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:51,230
保利也只不過保護他們不被別人欺侮詐騙
All they got from Paulie was protection from other guys looking to rip them off.

133
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,340
就是這樣  FBI始終搞不懂這一點
That's what it's all about. That's what the FBI could never understand.

134
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,940
保利所做的
What Paulie and the Organization does...

135
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,050
就是保護那些無法受警察保護的人
is offer protection for people who can't go to the cops. That's it.

136
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,750
保利就像是兄弟們的警察局長
That's all it is. They're like the police department for wiseguys.

137
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,660
別人看我的眼光都不一樣  因為我和大人物在一起
People looked at me differently, and they knew I was with somebody.

138
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,170
我連禮拜天買新鮮麵包都用不著排隊了
I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery on Sunday mornings for fresh bread.

139
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,710
老闆知道我跟誰在一起
The owner knew who I was with...

140
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,240
他會從櫃檯後面走出來  不管有多少人在等
and he'd come from around the counter. No matter how many were waiting...

141
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,400
他都會先招呼我
I was taken care of first.

142
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,980
鄰居再也不將車停在我們車道上了
Our neighbors didn't park in our driveway anymore...

143
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,780
雖然我們沒有車  我十三歲的時候
even though we didn't have a car. At 13...

144
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,820
我賺的錢已經比附近的大人還多
I was making more money than most of the grown-ups around.

145
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,120
我的錢多得花不完  要什麼有什麼
I had more money than I could spend. I had it all.

146
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:58,930
有一天  附近幾個孩子們還幫我媽把菜拎回家
One day, some neighborhood kids carried my mother's groceries all the way home.

147
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,540
知道為什麼嗎
You know why?

148
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,210
因為他們尊敬我
It was out of respect.

149
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,040
媽媽  你認為如何
Hi, Mom, what do you think?

150
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,350
- 你看我的鞋  很棒吧  - 老天呀
- Look at my shoes, aren't they great? - My God.

151
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,480
你看上去像個黑幫分子
You look like a gangster.

152
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,350
他們射中我了  救命
They shot me. Help!

153
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,690
亨利  把門關上
Henry, shut the door.

154
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,000
那是我第一次看到槍擊
That was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.

155
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,930
別在店裏搞這些  天吶
Can't have that in here. Jesus Christ!

156
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,040
我不准在這裏弄這種事
I can't have that in this joint.

157
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,900
我記得我為那個人感到難過
I remember feeling bad about the guy...

158
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,240
我也記得或許杜迪是對的
but I also remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.

159
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,140
我知道保利不要有任何人死在屋裏
I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.

160
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:41,110
你真是個大白癡  你糟蹋了八條圍裙
You're a real jerk. You wasted eight fucking aprons on this guy.

161
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,550
你他媽的到底怎麼了  我要讓這個小鬼長進一點
What the hell's wrong with you? I got to toughen this kid up.

162
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,140
那真是一段光彩的日子
It was a glorious time.

163
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,670
到處都是兄弟們
And wiseguys were all over the place.

164
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,580
那是在阿帕拉欽事件之前
It was before Apalachin and before Crazy Joe...

165
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,650
在瘋子周和老大開戰前
decided to take on a boss and start a war.

166
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,380
我就是那時候認清世界
It was when I met the world.

167
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,250
並認識吉米·康威
And it was when I first met Jimmy Conway.

168
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,890
他頂多不過二十八九歲
He couldn't have been more than 28 or 29 at the time...

169
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,960
但已經是個傳奇人物了
but he was already a legend.

170
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:33,130
他只要一走進來  廳裏所有的人就像發瘋一樣
He'd walk in the door and everybody who worked the room just went wild.

171
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,900
幫他開門  就給一百塊小費
He'd give the doorman $100 just for opening the door.

172
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,970
他常塞百元大鈔給那些發牌跟主持賭局的人
He'd give hundreds to the dealers and the guys who ran the games.

173
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,110
連酒保也有百元小費  只要冰塊夠冰的話
The bartender got $100 just for keeping the ice cubes cold.

174
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,340
讓愛爾蘭人來贏你們這些意大利人的錢了
The Irishman is here to take all you guineas' money.

175
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,320
- 你要不要喝一杯  - 給我一杯七喜加海馬七威士忌
- Want a drink? - Give me a 7 and 7.

176
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,830
- 來見見這個小子亨利  - 很高興認識你
- I'd like you to meet the kid Henry. - How you doing?

177
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,930
- 謝謝你  - 繼續上酒
- Thank you. - Keep them coming.

178
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,100
吉米是全城當時最令人敬畏的人之一
Jimmy was one of the most feared guys in the city.

179
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,870
他第一次被關起來時才十一歲
He was first locked up at 11...

180
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,140
十六歲就替他老闆殺人了
and he was doing hits for mob bosses when he was 16.

181
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:19,110
吉米一點也不在乎殺人  那是他的職業
See, hits never bothered Jimmy. It was business.

182
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,640
但是吉米真正的愛好
But what Jimmy really loved to do...

183
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,810
是偷東西
what he really loved to do was steal.

184
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,180
那對他來說是一種享受
He actually enjoyed it.

185
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,290
吉米就是那種支持電影裏的壞蛋的那種人
Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.

186
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,760
把你的錢包給我
Give me your wallet.

187
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,860
你也許知道我們是誰  我們可清楚的知道你的底細  懂嗎
You might know who we are, but we know who you are. Understand?

188
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,470
他是當時城裏最大的劫車犯之一
He was one of the city's biggest hijackers...

189
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,200
劫運酒車  運煙車  運蝦  刮鬍刀  龍蝦等等
of booze, cigarettes, razor blades, shrimp and lobsters.

190
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,280
蝦跟龍蝦是最好的貨  很快就銷出去了
Shrimp and lobsters were best. They went really fast.

191
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,350
幾乎所有的劫案都是不用暴力的
Almost all of them were gimmies. They just gave it up, no problem.

192
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,180
他們甚至稱他為紳士吉米
They called him Jimmy the Gent.

193
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,480
幫幫小姐
Help the lady.

194
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,680
開貨車的都喜歡他  有好貨的時候
Drivers loved him. They used to tip him off...

195
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,420
他們都會把消息告訴他  當然  每個人都得到好處
about the really good loads. Of course, everybody got a piece.

196
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,680
謝了  我等下再來拿剩下的煙
Thanks, I'll be back for the rest later.

197
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,290
好吧  一會兒見
Okay, see you later.

198
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,460
亨利  到這裏來
Henry, come here.

199
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,390
- 跟湯米打個招呼  - 你好嗎  亨利
- Say hello to Tommy. - How're you doing, Henry?

200
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,560
你們好好的一起工作  好嗎
You're gonna be working together, okay?

201
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,470
儘管幫他
Help him. Go ahead.

202
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,930
吉米  偷到什麼好東西了嗎
Jimmy, you got anything good?

203
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,340
警察曾經派出大軍來捉吉米  他怎麼做
And when the cops assigned a whole army to stop Jimmy, what did he do?

204
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,410
他把他們變成了同夥
He made them partners.

205
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,240
想抱怨也沒人會聽
I'd complain, but who'd listen?

206
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,140
- 一條帕爾瑪爾  - 來

- 你從哪裏弄來的香煙  - 把他弄走
- Where'd you get the cigarettes? - Get him out of here.

213
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,600

- What for? I got pinched. - Everyone does, but you did it right.

你什麼也沒說  他們也沒得到線索
You told them nothing, and they got nothing.

226
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,510

絕不背叛你的朋友

230

還有永不洩漏任何秘密

234
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:31,470
艾得偉機場  1963年

235
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:46,350
到我長大  每年從艾得偉機場
By the time I grew up, there was $30 billion a year in cargo...

236
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,250
進出的貨值300億
moving through Idlewild Airport...

237
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,520
你信不信  我們試圖把它偷光
and believe me, we tried to steal every bit of it.

238
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,450
我們是在機場旁邊混大的
See, you gotta understand, we grew up near the airport.

239
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,120
機場是屬於保利的
It belonged to Paulie.

240
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,960
我們有親戚朋友在各部門工作
We had friends and relatives who worked all over the place.

241
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,940
他們會告訴我們貨物進出的消息
They would tip us off about what was coming in and moving out.

242
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,200
假如有航空公司或是卡車司機找我們麻煩
If any truckers or airlines gave us trouble...

243
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,440
保利和他的工會人員就以罷工嚇他們  棒極了
Paulie had the union people scare them with a strike. It was beautiful.

244
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:14,410
這比彩票還賺  吉米就是管這檔事的
It was a bigger moneymaker than numbers and Jimmy was in charge of it all.

245
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,380
我們一需要錢就搶機場
Whenever we needed money, we'd rob the airport.

246
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,040
比搶花旗銀行還牛
To us, it was better than Citibank.

247
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,500
你有電話嗎  快呀
You got a phone? Come on!

248
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:37,400
兩個黑鬼偷了我的卡車  你相信這種事嗎
Two niggers just stole my truck. Can you believe that shit?

And his guys, Frankie the Wop.

256
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,430
還有沒鼻子佛萊迪
Freddy No Nose.

257
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,890
還有劊子手彼得  他是救世波爾的兄弟
And then there was Pete the Killer, who was Sally Balls'brother.

258
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,170
又有犀利眼尼基
Then you had Nickey Eyes...

259
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,170
還有米奇·法斯
and Mikey Franzese.

260
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,780
是呀  我想見他
That guy, I wanna see him.

261
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,580
還有由於什麼話都說兩遍而命名的二次奇米
Jimmy Two Times, who got that nickname because he said everything twice.

262
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,240
我要去拿報紙  拿報紙
I'm gonna go get the papers, get the papers.

263
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:40,170
這是什麼  大衣  亨利  我要西裝呀
What is this? Coats? Henry, I need suits, not coats.

264
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,160
西裝呀  禮拜四會到
Suits are coming Thursday.

265
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,210
可是現在是夏天  你叫我怎麼處理毛皮
But it's the middle of summer. What'll I do with fur coats?

266
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,500
你不要毛皮  那我把毛皮拿走
You don't want furs? I'll take them away.

267
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:52,050
不要拿走  我要用  我們把它們跟肉一起掛在冷凍庫裏
No, I want them. We'll hang them in the freezer with the meat. How's that?

268
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,880
要我們改變生活方式是不可能的
For us, to live any other way was nuts.

269
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,320
要我們跟那些老好人一樣找份爛工作  錢又少
To us, those goody-good people who worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks...

270
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,360
每天擠地下鐵上下班  帳單一大堆  不如死掉
and took the subway to work every day and worried about bills, were dead.

271
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,490
那些都是沒勇氣的弱者
They were suckers. They had no balls.

272
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,160
假如我們想要什麼  我們就拿
If we wanted something, we just took it.

273
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:13,790
任何人敢抱怨兩次以上  會被揍得不敢再抱怨第三次了
If anyone complained twice, they got hit so bad they never complained again.

274
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,460
一切都好像順理成章  根本不用多傷腦筋
It was just all routine. You didn't even think about it.

275
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,080
520和469有什麼關係
Frankie, what the fuck does 520 have to do with 469?

276
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,640
真不相信有這種人
I can't believe this guy.

277
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:28,770
520和469根本差太遠了
520 ain't even close to 469. What's that got to do with anything?

278
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,750
簡單得很  萬事俱備
Piece of cake. It's all there.

279
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,220
不用擔心警鈴  我在想辦法把鑰匙弄到手
Don't worry about the alarms. I just gotta find a way to get the key.

280
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,880
- 不會有問題吧  - 我會把事弄妥的
- No problem, right? - I'll take care of it.

281
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,830
- 把你告訴我的事告訴他  - 好得難以置信
- Tell him what you were telling me. - Too good to be true.

282
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,500
法國航空公司有大生意了  有一袋袋的錢要托運
Big score coming from Air France. Bags of money coming in.

283
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,200
美國的觀光客和軍人  他們把美金換成法郎
Tourists and American servicemen change their money...

284
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,280
美金又被運回來
into French money and send it back here.

285
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,510
- 冷靜一點  - 太美了
- Calm down. - It's beautiful.

286
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:07,180
完全無法追蹤
It's totally untraceable. Okay?

287
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,020
唯一的問題就是怎麼拿到鑰匙  但我已經想到辦法了
The only problem is getting a key, but I've got a plan.

288
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,560
- 我和法國佬和這個國民  - 這笨蛋很容易操縱的
- Me and Frenchy and this citizen. - Yeah, he's a piece of work.

289
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:17,600
假如我估計正確  那裏有50萬現金
If I'm right, there could be $500,000 coming in, all cash.

290
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,400
他說最好在週末下手  也許禮拜六晚上
The best time is probably over a weekend. So maybe Saturday night.

291
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,560
禮拜一是猶太教假日
There's a Jewish holiday on Monday.

292
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,070
要到禮拜二才會被發現  太美了
They won't find out until Tuesday. Beautiful.

293
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,070
警衛怎麼辦
What about the security?

294
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,470
警衛嗎
Security?

295
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,870
這位就是  笑死了  我就是午夜到早上八點的班
You're looking at it. It's a joke. I'm the midnight-to-eight man.

296
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,540
我就是總司令
I'm the commandant.

297
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,480
他就像來招領失物一樣就行了
He just comes in like he's picking up lost baggage.

298
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,180
- 太美了  - 不會出任何問題的
- It's beautiful. - It won't be a problem at all.

299
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,920
- 好  - 就這麼辦
- Good. - We're on.

300
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,550
最可笑的是在席考克斯搶銀行那一次
What's really funny is that fucking bank job in Secaucus.

301
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,820
我正躺在草裏
I'm in the middle of the weeds, lying down.

302
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,220
警察走過來問我  你在幹什麼
He says, "What are you doing?"

303
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,200
我說  我在休息呀
I said, "I'm resting."

304
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,160
這不是公園或海灘  我說  我在休息
"Here? This ain't no beach or park." I said, "I'm resting."

305
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,740
他們把我捉進去問東問西
He pulls me in, starts asking questions. You know, this and that.

306
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,850
你要告訴我們些什麼呢  我說  一如往常  零
"What are you going to tell us?" I said, "My usual. Nothing."

307
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:08,380
為什麼要告訴你  干  他說  今天你非說不可
"Why tell you?" The fuck. He says, "No, you'll tell me something today."

308
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,020
我說  那好  你去操你媽吧
I said, "Okay, go fuck your mother."

309
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:18,630
你看報紙了沒有  安東尼  我的頭腫得這麼大
You saw the paper, Anthony. My head was out like this.

310
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,800
當我醒過來
Now I'm coming around, and who do I see in front of me?

311
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:26,630
這死傢伙又站在我面前  你現在還有什麼話說
This prick again. He says, "What do you want to tell me now?"

312
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,760
你在這兒幹嘛  我不是叫你去操你媽嗎
I said, "What are you doing here? I told you to go fuck your mother."

313
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,900
我以為他會拉在褲子裏
I thought he was gonna shit.

314
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:39,040
我又被揍了一頓  那時候我真希望我是個大個子
The fuckers. I wish I was big just once.

315
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,380
真好玩  真滑稽
Funny. You're really funny.

316
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,560
你是什麼意思
What do you mean, I'm funny?

317
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,960
就是好玩  我是說你的故事很搞笑
It's funny, you know. It's a good story.

318
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,820
你很幽默
You're a funny guy.

319
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,060
你說我講話的樣子嗎
You mean the way I talk? What?

320
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,600
只是  你很有趣
It's just, you know. You're just funny.

321
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,040
你講事情經過的樣子  很有趣
You know, the way you tell the story and everything.

322
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,570
滑稽  好玩  有什麼好玩
Funny how? What's funny about it?

323
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,070
- 湯米  你誤會了  - 安東尼
- Tommy, you got it all wrong. - Anthony.

324
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,410
他又不是小孩子  讓他自己解釋  到底怎麼有趣法
He's a big boy. He knows what he said. What did you say?

325
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,880
只是  你就是很有趣嘛
Just, you know. You're funny.

326
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,220
讓我把事情弄清楚
Let me understand this.

327
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,450
也許我有點醉了
Maybe I'm a little fucked up.

328
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,960
但我是怎麼個有趣法  像小丑一樣嗎
But, I'm funny, how? Funny like a clown? I amuse you?

329
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,290
我是來逗你開心的嗎
I make you laugh? I'm here to fucking amuse you?

330
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,130
我到底是哪裏滑稽
What do you mean, funny? How am I funny?

331
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,900
你也知道嘛  就是你講故事的方式
You know, how you tell a story.

332
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,800
不  我不懂  是你說的
No, I don't know. You said it. How do I know? You said I'm funny.

333
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:46,380
我到底是哪裏滑稽
How the fuck am I funny? What the fuck is so funny about me?

334
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,050
我哪裏有趣  告訴我呀
Tell me what's funny.

335
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,990
你有完沒完呀  湯米
Get the fuck out of here, Tommy.

336
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,290
他媽的  他差點被我唬住了
Motherfucker! I almost had him!

337
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,400
你這個講話結巴的死傢伙  你
You stuttering prick, you!

338
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,500
法蘭基  他有沒有發抖
Frankie, was he shaking?

339
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:09,370
我真擔心你  亨利  你經不起拷問
I wonder about you sometimes, Henry. You may fold under questioning.

340
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,030
耶穌基督啊
Jesus Christ.

341
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,840
你在搞什麼呀  我還以為我被捕了
What the fuck is it with you? I thought I was getting pinched already.

342
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,350
他靠著我脖子  好像禿鷹一樣  你要什麼
He's hanging on my fucking neck like a vulture. What do you want?

343
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,750
夥計他說不敢把帳單拿過來給你
This guy didn't want to come and give you the check.

344
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,850
你能不能結一下帳
Could you take care of this?

345
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,820
沒問題  叫他記在我帳上
No problem. Tell him to put it on my tab. Of course.

346
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,890
我就是想跟你商量一下
That's what I want to talk to you about.

347
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,500
你的帳不只這些  你還欠我七千
It ain't just this one. It's seven big ones you owe me.

348
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,460
已經到七千塊了  不是小數目  我也不想失禮
$7,000, that ain't peanuts. I don't mean to be out of order...

349
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,660
你不想失禮
Don't mean to be out of order?

350
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,930
好在你不想失禮
It's good you don't mean to be out of order.

351
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:48,800
在我朋友面前說我賴帳
Embarrassing me in front of my friends, like I'm a deadbeat.

352
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,840
你知道嗎  桑尼  你真他媽的夠賤的
You know, Sonny, you're a fucking mutt.

353
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,980
我們在你這裏消費了多少
You know the money we spend in this fucking...

354
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,410
- 別這樣嘛  - 什麼別這樣
- Don't be like that. - What do you mean?

355
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:05,360
世界上真有這種人  你覺得這個有趣嗎
Do you believe this prick? You think this is funny?

356
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:12,030
你他媽的看什麼  你這個白癡
What the fuck are you looking at? You fucking moron!

357
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,770
你不願意拿帳單給我是不是
You don't want to bring the check?

358
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,430
真有這種人
Do you believe this prick?

359
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,010
你也應該對他們狠一點
You're supposed to be doing this stuff, too.

360
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,870
你真有意思
You're a funny guy.

361
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,910
- 這次你完了  亨利  - 不要這樣  坐下
- That's it, Henry. - No, go back.

362
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:34,750
你想笑嗎  這混蛋上禮拜還叫我給他兒子洗禮呢
You want to laugh? This prick last week asked me to christen his kid.

363
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,190
我就算他七千塊吧
I charged him $7,000.

364
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,720
你真笑死我了
You really are a funny guy.

365
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,490
我很擔心  我聽到些奇奇怪怪的事
I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of fucking bad things.

366
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,840
湯米對待我的方式就好像我是什麼怪物  同性戀似的
He's treating me like I'm a fucking fag.

367
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:55,530
我沒辦法逃避他
I got to go on the lam in order to get away from this guy.

368
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,700
他這樣是不對的  我沒地方好去
This ain't right. I can't go here, I can't go there.

369
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,210
不是只有你  我跟兄弟們說了很多次了  他們不聽
You think you're the only one? I talk to them, they don't listen.

370
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,320
假如你跟他說  他會聽的
If you tell him, he'll stop. I'll wind up being declared an MIA.

371
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,510
否則我會被發現死在後車廂或草叢裏
They'll find me in the back of a car somewhere in the weeds.

372
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,180
沒人比你更清楚湯米
You've known this Tommy all your life. Who knows better?

373
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,850
這傢伙是終極罪犯
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.

374
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:17,660
我每天出門的時候都擔心會遭暗算
When I leave my house, before I get to the car I look over both shoulders.

375
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,270
我沒法活下去了
This is no way to live. I'm no fence jumper.

376
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,730
我跟了你一輩子  你說我該怎麼辦
I'm around you all my life, tell me what I gotta do.

377
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,700
- 我必須怎麼做  就怎麼做  - 我能做什麼呢
- Whatever I got to do, I'm gonna do. - What could I do?

378
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:29,970
如果我能幫上忙  我一定會做的
If there was something I could do, I would. I would like to help you out.

379
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,800
桑尼  告訴他我們談的事
Sonny, tell him what we talked about.

380
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,170
- 你覺得妥當嗎  - 說吧
- You think it's all right? - Yeah.

381
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:41,580
我希望你成為我店裏的股東之一  那就好了
Maybe you could come in with me, take a piece of this joint. It'd be good.

382
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,730
你在說什麼  你是說餐廳
What are you talking about? You mean the restaurant?

383
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,620
那是個高級地方
It's a classy place. Look at the layout.

384
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,860
你去過很多次了
You've been in there a million times. You know how it looks.

385
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,760
如果湯米接去做  簡直像給豬戴絲帽一樣
Tommy taking over this joint is like putting a silk hat on a pig.

386
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,930
我不是看不起他  事實是如此
I don't mean no disrespect, but that's the way it is.

387
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,540
我還能說什麼  我是在求你
I know you're his friend. I'm begging you. What can I say?

388
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,180
我能做什麼
What am I gonna do? What do you want from me?

389
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:09,110
我對餐廳一竅不通
I don't know anything about the restaurant business. Nothing.

390
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,720
我只會點菜而已
All I know is to sit down and order a meal, not how to make a restaurant.

391
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,120
不是要你去管理  你只是多一個地方走動而已
Not for you. It's just a place to hang.

392
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:18,950
那裏的廚師很棒  表演也很好  漂亮小妞也多
The chef is great. The shows are good. There's a lot of whores coming in.

393
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:22,060
我真的很願意幫你  你要我怎麼做
I'd love to help you, but what do you want from me? What'll I do?

394
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,560
湯米是夠壞的  難道要我槍斃他
Tommy's a bad kid, a bad seed. What am I supposed to do? Shoot him?

395
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,700
這倒不是個壞主意
That wouldn't be a bad idea.

396
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:37,110
對不起  我不是真心的  只是他令我害怕
I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean it. I just mean that he's scaring me.

397
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,780
我需要你的幫忙  求求你
I just need help. Help me, please.

398
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,020
餐廳生意你懂嗎
You know anything about this restaurant business?

399
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,980
他什麼都懂  他從早到晚都在那裏
He knows everything. He's there 24 hours a day.

400
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,820
他就像那裏的椅子一樣
Another fucking few minutes, he could be a stool.

401
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,550
永遠都在裏面
That's how often he's in there.

402
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,460
你要我做你的股東  搞了半天就是要我做你的股東是嗎
You want me to be your partner? Is that what you're telling me?

403
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:58,190
你以為我在說什麼  好不好  保利
What the fuck you think I'm talking about? Paulie, please. Come on.

404
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,340
那太不公平了
It's not even fair.

405
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,030
別這麼說
You don't understand.

406
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,640
好吧  你管理  我來從旁協助
You run the joint. Maybe I'll try to help you, all right.

407
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:09,900
上帝保佑你  保利  我真的很感激你  你對我真好
God bless you, Paulie. I appreciate it. You've always been fair with me.

408
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,950
現在桑尼有保利撐腰了  發生任何問題他都找保利
Now the guy's got Paulie as a partner. Any problems, he goes to Paulie.

409
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,210
有人不付錢  他就找保利
Trouble with a bill, he can go to Paulie.

410
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,510
警察  送貨的  甚至湯米給他找麻煩
Trouble with the cops, deliveries, Tommy...

411
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,980
他都能去找保利
he can call Paulie.

412
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,950
可是現在他每星期得付保利保護費
Now the guy's gotta come up with Paulie's money every week...

413
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,180
無論狀況如何
no matter what.

414
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,420
生意不好嗎  去你的  付錢  店失火啦  去你的  付錢
"Business is bad? Fuck you, pay me. Had a fire? Fuck you, pay me.

415
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,400
店被雷擊中啦  去你的  付錢
"The place got hit by lightning? Fuck you, pay me."

416
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,730
電視機給我一台好不好
Can I get one of those TVs?

417
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,560
保利可以為所欲為
Also, Paulie could do anything.

418
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,760
特別是拿餐廳的信貸到處消費
Especially run up bills on the joint's credit. And why not?

419
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,910
反正不準備付錢的
Nobody's gonna pay for it anyway.

420
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,040
貨一旦從前門進
When deliveries are made at the front door...

421
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,910
就送出後門廉價拍賣
you move the stuff out the back and sell it at a discount.

422
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,350
二百塊的一箱酒一百塊賣出去
You take a $200 case of booze and sell it for $100.

423
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,080
也不要緊  反正都是淨賺
It doesn't matter. It's all profit.

424
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,360
到最後
Then finally, when there's nothing left...

425
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,510
真他媽夠可惜了
Fucking shame.

426
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:01,860
別人不再借錢給你  廠商也不再送貨了
...when you can't borrow another buck or buy another case of booze...

427
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:04,760
你只好點根火柴把店燒了  領保險金
you bust the joint out. You light a match.

428
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,420
有什麼夠不到的  需要我幫你嗎
Do you need help reaching anything?

429
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,930
你像在裝飾一顆聖誕樹一樣
You look like you're decorating a Christmas tree.

430
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,300
你根本什麼都不會
You don't know what you're doing.

431
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,070
她是從富人區來的
She's from the Five Towns.

432
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,840
誰呀
Who?

433
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,250
那個猶太馬子  戴安  我想跟她上床
The Jew broad, Diane, I was telling you I'm going to shag.

434
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,910
我已經試了一個月了
I've been trying to bang her for a fucking month now.

435
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,320
問題就是她從不肯跟我單獨約會
She won't go out with me alone.

436
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,520
- 不  - 什麼不
- No. - No, what?

437
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,790
不什麼  我又沒請你
No, what? Who the fuck asked you anything?

438
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,900
我又沒問你  至少聽我說完好不好
I didn't ask you. Hear what I'm going to say.

439
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,620
好啦  什麼啦
All right, what?

440
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:38,330
好啦  是這樣
Okay, what.

441
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:41,160
她不肯跟意大利人出去
She don't want to go out with Italians alone.

442
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,530
她對意大利人有偏見
She's prejudiced against Italians.

443
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,110
什麼時候了  還有這種事
You fucking believe that? In this day and age?

444
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,870
這是什麼世界啊
What the fuck is this world coming to?

445
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,780
難以相信  一個猶太馬子對意大利人有偏見
I can't believe this. A Jew broad, prejudiced against Italians.

446
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:57,080
除非和她的女朋友一起  她絕不單獨跟我約會
She won't go out with me alone unless her girlfriend comes with us.

447
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,220
所以我想你可以當她女朋友的伴
So you come along, go out with her girlfriend.

448
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,220
看吧  我就知道
See? I knew it.

449
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,690
你知道什麼  有什麼不好
You knew what? What the fuck is wrong with that?

450
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,880
- 什麼時候  - 明天晚上
- When is this? - Tomorrow night.

451
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,590
明晚不行  我要見杜迪
I can't, I gotta meet Tuddy.

452
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,490
你可以早點出來  事後再去見杜迪
You could meet Tuddy. You can come early and then still go.

453
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:13,000
- 你怎麼老是這樣  - 別找理由了
- Why do you always do this? - Don't give me that shit.

454
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,660
我是找你幫忙
What did I ask you for? I'm asking you for a favor.

455
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,600
我幫過你不少忙的
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.

456
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,640
我想搞那娘們  你懂不懂
I'm trying to bang this fucking broad. Help me out.

457
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,880
她真的很漂亮
I don't understand you. She's beautiful!

458
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,110
住在高級區  這些猶太女孩很有錢
Her fucking family lives in the Five Towns. These Jews got money.

459
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,650
說不定整條街都是她家的  你也許會中頭獎也不一定
Maybe the family owns the whole block. You may wind up with a big score.

460
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,850
光聽你講猶太女朋友好了
You with your fucking mouth.

461
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,700
我約了杜迪十一點見  現在我正在給湯米做搭檔
I had a meeting with Tuddy at 11:00, and here I am, a backup guy for Tommy.

462
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,430
你吃飽了嗎
How about it? Did you have enough to eat?

463
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,130
很好吃  我正在節食
It was delicious. I'm just watching my diet.

464
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,640
讓我替你注意身材就好了
Let me watch your figure.

465
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:53,330
我等不及離開
I couldn't wait to get away.

466
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:56,070
他們還在吃主菜  我就已經叫點心了
I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner.

467
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,740
他們還在喝咖啡  我就先結帳了
When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check.

468
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,070
我有事情
I had business.

469
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,740
喝點咖啡吧  會清醒一點
Have some coffee. It'll wake you up.

470
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,020
- 帳單給我  - 你急什麼呀
- Can we have the check? - What are you doing?

471
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,320
- 我得走了  - 我們才剛到
- I got to go. - We just got here.

472
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,480
我還有事  我要走了
I got that thing. I gotta go.

473
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,790
再等幾分鐘  我們一起離開好嗎
Wait a couple of minutes. We'll leave together.

474
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,760
這樣才不會像一群流浪漢  一個一個走
This way we don't go out like a bunch of hobos, one at a time.

475
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,160
我受不了他
I couldn't stand him.

476
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,660
我覺得他真的很倒胃口
I thought he was really obnoxious.

477
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,860
四肢一直擺弄著
He kept fidgeting around.

478
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:28,810
可不可以不要玩打火機  很煩
You don't mind, do you? That's very annoying.

479
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:35,580
也許甜酒比較適合你  但我喝就不像樣了
Good? You might prefer Manischewitz, but it'd look funny on my table.

480
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,890
- 可以走了吧  - 亨利  放鬆一點嘛
- Ready? - Henry, lighten up.

481
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,290
我們才剛到  別緊張  好不好
We just got here. What are you doing?

482
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:46,690
回家的時候還沒到  他就把我推進車門
Before it was time to go home, he was pushing me into the car...

483
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,200
又拉了出來  太荒唐了
then pulling me out. It was ridiculous.

484
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,060
戴安和湯米
Diane and Tommy made us promise...

485
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,140
又約我們星期五見
to meet them again on Friday night.

486
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,460
我們答應了
We agreed.

487
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,300
果不其然  星期五晚上亨利沒來
Of course, when Friday night came around, Henry stood me up.

488
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,270
真抱歉  我不知道他在哪
I feel terrible. I don't know where he is.

489
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,810
可是他真的很喜歡你  他一直不停地談她
He really liked you, too. All he did was talk about her.

490
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,470
那天約會之夜只有我們三個人
We were a trio instead of a double date that night.

491
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:12,450
他該來通電話  我真擔心  希望不是太嚴重
He would have called. I hope it's nothing serious.

492
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,320
我逼湯米帶我去找他
But I made Tommy take me looking for him.

493
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,420
湯米  你搞什麼
Tommy, what the fuck?

494
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,390
你真有種呀  跟我爽約
You got some nerve standing me up.

495
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:25,970
從來沒有人敢這樣對我
Nobody does that to me.

496
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:29,800
你以為你是誰  像法蘭奇·瓦利那樣的大歌星嗎
Who do you think you are, Frankie Valli or some kind of big shot?

497
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,830
慢著好不好  我忘了  我以為是下星期
Slow down, I forgot. I thought it was next week.

498
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:37,270
是這個星期五  你答應的  你這個騙子
It was this Friday and you agreed, so you're a liar!

499
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,210
別這樣  別這樣  我們好好談一下
We can talk about this. Take it easy.

500
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,820
有什麼好談的
Talk about it?

501
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,420
去你的吧  我們沒什麼好談的
Talk to you after what you just did to me? Forget it.

502
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:50,380
我以為你不會來的  你那天什麼也不說  一副無聊的樣子
I thought you would stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything.

503
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,690
再給我一次補償的機會吧
Let me make it up to you.

504
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,160
讓我考慮一下
I'll think about it.

505
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:59,860
我記得她在街上大喊大叫
I remember, she was screaming on the street, and I mean loud.

506
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,260
可是看起來真動人
But she looked good.

507
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,670
我會考慮考慮  不過有代價的  希爾
I'll think about it. But it'll cost you, Hill. A lot.

508
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,430
她的眼睛真美  就像伊莉莎白·泰勒（好萊塢女星）一樣
She had these great eyes just like Liz Taylor's.

509
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,670
至少我這麼覺得
At least that's what I thought.

510
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,170
哈羅  亨利
Hello, Henry.

511
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,680
- 你準備好了嗎  - 好了
- You're ready? - Yeah.

512
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:14,840
那走吧
Come on.

513
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,780
- 不  等一下  - 什麼
- No, wait a minute. - What?

514
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,780
快  把十字架蓋起來  我媽看到她會認為你是基督徒（猶太人不信基督教）
Quick, you have to cover that cross. My mother sees that...

515
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,180
凱倫
Karen.

516
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,780
媽
Mom.

517
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,260
- 這是我朋友亨利·希爾  - 你好嗎
- I'd like you to meet my friend, Henry Hill. - How do you do?

518
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:29,420
我女兒說你是半個猶太人
My daughter says that you're half Jewish.

519
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,470
好的一半是
It's just the good half.

520
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,230
- 謝謝  先生  - 謝謝
- Thank you, sir. - Bye, see you later, thanks.

521
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,630
你幹嘛把車停在這裏
What're you doing? You're leaving your car?

522
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,470
他會替我看著
He watches the car for me.

523
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,340
比停在停車場快多了
It's easier than leaving it at a garage and waiting.

524
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,380
這樣快多了  懂我意思嗎
It's a lot quicker that way, you know what I mean?

525
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:55,920
我喜歡從這裏走  比排隊好
I like going in this way. It's better than waiting in line.

526
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,990
你好  一切都好吧  這給你
How are you doing? What's up? Here you go.

527
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:13,140
- 你好嗎  - 你好
- How are you doing? - I'm doing all right.

528
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:21,610
我每次來  你們兩個都在這裏  不用工作嗎
Every time I come here, every time, you two. Don't you work?

529
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:14,730
你好嗎  嗨  你好嗎
Henry, nice to see you. Hi, how are you?

530
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,960
安東尼  擺在最前面
Anthony, right in the front.

531
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,400
如果需要什麼  告訴我就好了
Anything you need, just let me know.

532
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,420
東尼  真是謝了  我很感激
Tony, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

533
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,000
- 你給他們每人二十塊錢  - 沒關係的
- You gave them $20 each. - It's all right.

534
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,570
亨利  這是東尼先生送的
Henry, this is with Mr. Tony, over there.

535
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,040
- 在哪裏  - 就在這邊
- Where? - Over there.

536
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:57,180
謝了  東尼
Thanks a lot, Tony.

537
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,810
- 你靠什麼生活  - 什麼
- What do you do? - What?

538
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,540
- 你靠什麼生活  - 我在建築界
- What do you do? - I'm in construction.

539
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,860
這雙手不像做建築的
They don't feel like you're in construction.

540
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,790
我是工會代表
I'm a union delegate.

541
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,720
各位女士  先生
Now, ladies and gentlemen...

542
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:19,490
很榮幸為各位介紹單句笑話之王
the Copacabana is proud to present the king of one-liners...

543
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,600
亨利·洋曼
Henny Youngman.

544
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:31,510
各位好  我能在這裏表演感到驕傲  請把我太太帶走
How are you all? I'm glad to be here. Take my wife, please.

545
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,110
不論我把我太太丟在什麼地方  她總會回家
I take my wife everywhere but she finds her way home.

546
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,020
我問她要去哪裏慶祝結婚紀念
I said, "Where do you wanna go for our anniversary?"

547
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,050
她說要到一個她從來沒去過的地方
She said, "Somewhere I've never been before."

548
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,490
我說  那就去廚房好了
I said, "Try the kitchen."

549
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,790
韋士勒醫生在場
Dr. Wellsler is here.

550
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,990
給病人估計還能活六個月  時候到了卻繳不出來醫藥費
Gave a guy six months to live. Couldn't pay his bill.

551
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,260
他又告訴病人還能再活六個月
Gave him another six months.

552
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,140
我真喜歡你們
I love this crowd.

553
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,480
非工作人員止步

554
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,490
是法國航空讓我成功的
Air France made me.

555
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:17,420
連槍都沒有用就搶走了42萬
We walked out with $420,000 without using a gun.

556
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:21,150
當然也給了保利他應得的保護費
And we did the right thing. We gave Paulie his tribute.

557
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,360
6萬元
$60,000.

558
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,700
我們會過一個好夏天
It's going to be a good summer.

559
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:36,440
我為你驕傲  對你這個年紀  那是筆大數目
I'm proud of you. That is a lot of money for a kid like you.

560
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:40,570
任何人問起來  就說是在賭城贏的
Anybody asks you where you got it, you got it in Vegas playing craps, all right?

561
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,080
好的
All right.

562
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,120
先生  帳單
Check, sir.

563
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:50,050
別拿大票子  在這裏是用簽名的
No. You have to sign for it here.

564
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,390
要不要給他小費
Should I tip him?

565
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:04,060
- 你好嗎  - 很好  你呢
- How are you doing? - Okay. How are you?

566
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:08,210
亨利  這是布魯斯  布魯斯  這是亨利
Henry, this is Bruce. Bruce, this is Henry.

567
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,900
你好嗎
Good to meet you.

568
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,870
有機會再聚
I'll see you around later.

569
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,490
- 你認識他嗎  - 是呀
- Do you know him? - Yeah.

570
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,450
住我家對面
He lives across the street.

571
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:52,340
有一天晚上  巴比·雲頓送我們無比可口的香檳酒
One night, Bobby Vinton sent us champagne. There was nothing like it.

572
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:56,450
一個21歲的年輕人有這樣的關係
I didn't think there was anything strange in any of this.

573
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,590
我並不感到奇怪
A 21-year-old kid with such connections.

574
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,800
跟他在一起很刺激
He was an exciting guy.

575
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:08,430
他對我很好  把我介紹給他所有的朋友
He was really nice. He introduced me to everybody.

576
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,530
每個人都對他很好
Everybody wanted to be nice to him.

577
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,230
他也應對得很得體
He knew how to handle it.

578
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,550
不要買會掉下來的假髮
Don't buy wigs that come off at the wrong time.

579
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,350
摩裏的假髮不會掉下來
Morrie's wigs don't come off!

580
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,750
在水中也沒事
Even underwater.

581
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,340
在狂風中也安然無恙
And remember, Morrie's wigs are tested against hurricane winds.

582
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:37,090
別擔心價錢  價錢不是問題
Forget about money. You can afford a Morrie wig. Priced to fit every budget.

583
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,630
來電話
Call me now!

584
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,970
約時間試試看吧
Come in for a personalized fitting.

585
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,270
走呀  摩裏  吉米在等著  你欠的錢已經過期了
Come on, Morrie. Jimmy's waiting. You're past due.

586
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,940
你這個人不錯  我對你不錯  你對我也不錯
You're a good kid. We've been good to each other.

587
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,510
但有些事不合理
But there's something unreasonable going on here.

588
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,910
吉米太狠了
Jimmy's being a ball-breaker.

589
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:59,020
我賭克裏夫蘭隊  下注8:5
Give him 8-to-5 on Cleveland.

590
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:02,750
我沒法付那麼高的利息
I never had to pay the vigorish he demands. Am I something special?

591
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,590
你以為我是什麼  白癡呀
What am I, a schmuck on wheels?

592
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,190
你向吉米借了錢  你就該還給他
You know Jimmy. You borrowed his money. Pay him.

593
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,560
我沒同意高利之外又加三分
I didn't agree to three points above the vig.

594
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:12,330
你要怎麼樣嘛  你要對付吉米嗎
What are you going to do? Fight with Jimmy Conway?

595
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,700
他要他的錢  你付了錢  我好走路呀
He wants his money. Give him his money and we'll go.

596
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,860
去他的吧
Fuck him!

597
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,370
操他耳朵啦  操他另外一隻耳朵
Fuck him in the ear! Fuck him in the other ear!

598
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,270
我有沒有給他出過漏子
Did I ever bust his balls? Did I?

599
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,100
我只要一通電話給條子  我就什麼錢也不用付了
I could've dropped a dime a million times.

600
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,440
別發瘋了  好不好
You're talking crazy. Stop it now, will you?

601
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,810
你有錢去做電視廣告
You got money for that fucking commercial.

602
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,350
沒錢還給我是吧
You don't got my money?

603
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,390
吉米  他會還給你的
Jimmy, he's gonna pay you.

604
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,020
我要宰了你  你這個奴才  錢拿給我
I'll fucking kill you. Give me the money, cocksucker.

605
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,790
把錢還我
Pay me my money.

606
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,550
他會付
He'll pay.

607
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:46,430
摩裏假髮  是誰  他在這兒
Morrie's. Who's this? He's here.

608
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,460
- 對不起  吉米  - 你應該對不起
- Jimmy, I'm sorry. - You should be sorry.

609
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,830
把錢還我  再有一次你就完了
Don't do it again. Give me the fucking money!

610
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,980
你聽著  把錢還給我
You hear me? Give me the fucking money.

611
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:59,770
我會給  我會給
I'll give you. You've got it, kid. You've got it, believe me.

612
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,080
凱倫  慢慢講嘛
Karen, slow down.

613
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,410
哪裏  就在那裏  不要走開
Where? Stay there. Don't move.

614
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,650
- 發生了什麼事  - 是凱倫  吉米
- What happened? - It's Karen, Jimmy.

615
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,260
- 今天就付  - 我會付
- Money today. - I'll pay.

616
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,370
發生了什麼事
What happened?

617
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,730
- 你還好嗎  - 我沒事
- Are you all right? - Yeah.

618
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,340
是誰幹的
Who did it?

619
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:31,910
住在我家對面  我從小就認識的一個傢伙
This guy who lives across the street from me that I've known all my life.

620
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:39,990
他開始摸我  抓我
He started to touch me. He stared to grab me.

621
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,820
我叫他住手  他不聽
I told him to stop. He didn't stop.

622
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:46,830
我就打他  結果他發火了
I hit him back. And then he got really angry.

623
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:51,160
把我推出車外
He pushed me out of the car.

624
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,930
你確定你沒事嗎
You sure you're all right?

625
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:07,680
你進去吧  整理一下  梳洗乾淨
Why don't you go inside and get yourself together. Clean up.

626
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,200
你想幹什麼  敗類  你想要什麼嗎
What do you want, fucko? You want something?

627
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:41,910
以我母親的名義發誓  你再碰凱倫一下  你就死定了
I swear on my fucking mother, if you touch her again, you're dead.

628
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,050
不要開槍
Don't shoot.

629
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,200
- 把槍藏起來  你沒事吧  - 沒事
- Hide this. Are you all right? - Yeah.

630
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:15,180
我知道  一般女孩一定會和男朋友分手
I know there are women, like my best friends...

631
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,980
如果她男朋友拿一支槍
who would have gotten out the minute their boyfriend...

632
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:21,050
叫她拿去藏起來  但我沒有
gave them a gun to hide. But I didn't.

633
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,890
老實說  我覺得這很刺激
I've got to admit the truth. It turned me on.

634
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,630
恭喜
Mazel tov!

635
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:09,130
你為什麼不學亨利  他就有個好姑娘在身邊
Why don't you be like your friend Henry? He's got a nice girl.

636
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:12,430
他要安定了  妻子都娶了
He's settling down now. He's married.

637
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:14,910
不久就有個小家庭了
Pretty soon he'll have a nice family.

638
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,670
你老是一個接一個的換
And you're still bouncing around from girl to girl.

639
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,920
亨利好像有兩個家庭
It was like he had two families.

640
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:33,360
他把他們介紹給我時真是多到瘋掉
The first time I was introduced to all of them at once, it was crazy.

641
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:36,960
保利和他的兄弟們都有一大堆孩子
Paulie and his brothers had lots of sons and nephews.

642
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:40,270
幾乎都叫彼德或保羅
Almost all of them were named Peter or Paul.

643
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:43,230
簡直不敢相信
It was unbelievable.

644
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,770
這位是我侄兒小保利  然後這是彼迪
Meet Paulie Jr., my nephew. And this is Petey.

645
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:50,070
婚禮中起碼有兩打以上的彼德和保羅
There must have been two dozen Peters and Pauls at the wedding.

646
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,340
這是瑪莉
This is Marie.

647
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:54,350
他們的妻子也都叫瑪莉
Plus, they were all married to girls named Marie.

648
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,480
- 看起來像意大利人  - 沒錯  她就是意大利人
- She looks Italian. - She is Italian, you're right.

649
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:00,380
他們的女兒也都叫瑪莉
And they named all their daughters Marie.

650
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:04,990
這是彼德  不  是保利  我有時也會弄錯
And this is Pete. No, I mean Paulie. I get confused myself.

651
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:09,230
當我和每個人打過招呼後  我以為我醉了
By the time I finished meeting everybody, I thought I was drunk.

652
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:15,930
保利  你太客氣了
Paulie, you shouldn't have.

653
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,640
歡迎你成為家庭中的一份子
Welcome to the family.

654
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,130
星期日來我家晚餐
Sunday dinner?

655
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,970
真漂亮  我真想哭
So beautiful. I want to cry.

656
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:28,370
小小意思  可以幫你們建立一個家庭
Here's something to help you get started.

657
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:48,730
- 那個袋子  那個袋子呢  - 什麼袋子
- The bag. The bag. - What? What bag?

658
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,800
那個裝滿了信封和錢的袋子呀
The bag with the envelopes in it, all the money.

659
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:56,140
別擔心  沒人會偷的
Don't worry about that. Nobody's going to steal that here.

660
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:28,130
他連電話都沒打
He didn't call?

661
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:32,200
- 他和朋友在一起  - 他是什麼人  連電話都不打
- He's with his friends. - What kind of person doesn't call?

662
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:35,540
媽  他是成人  不需要每五分鐘來一個電話
He's a grown-up. He doesn't have to call every five minutes.

663
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,150
如果是成人  為什麼不搬出去住
If he was such a grown-up why doesn't he get you two an apartment?

664
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:42,750
媽  是你要我們住在這裏的
Don't start. Mom, you're the one who wanted us here.

665
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,490
聽著  你在這裏一個月了  我知道他經常不回家
You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all.

666
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,490
他們到底是什麼樣的人
What kind of people are these?

667
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,360
- 媽  你要我怎麼樣  - 你能怎麼樣
- What do you want me to do? - Do? What can you do?

668
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:55,930
他又不是猶太人  你瞭解他們嗎
He's not Jewish. Did you know how these people live?

669
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:59,260
你爸爸可不是整夜不歸  電話也不打
Your father never stayed out all night without calling.

670
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,890
整夜不歸  爸爸連門都不出  媽  你少管我們
Stay out? Daddy never went out at all, Ma! Keep out of it.

671
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:04,900
你不明白我的感覺
You don't know how I feel!

672
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:06,920
你有什麼感覺
How do you feel now?

673
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,030
既不知道他在哪裏  也不知道他和什麼人在一起
You don't know where he is or who he's with.

674
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,700
他和朋友在一起  爸爸
He's with his friends! Dad!

675
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,740
不要把你爸爸扯進來
Leave him out of this. He's suffered enough.

676
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,880
他已經有六星期消化不良了
He hasn't digested a decent meal in six weeks.

677
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,820
你去了些什麼地方  為什麼不打電話
Where were you? Why didn't you call?

678
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,660
我們擔心死了  已婚男人不該整夜不歸
We were worried to death. A married man does not stay out like this.

679
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:39,300
正常人沒有這種行為的
Normal people don't act like this!

680
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,540
你哪裏不對勁
What's wrong with you?

681
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:46,810
她沒說錯  你是不正常  你哪裏不對勁
You're not normal. She's right. What's wrong with you?

682
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:50,140
你有什麼毛病  你是什麼樣的人
What kind of person are you? What is the matter with you?

683
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,950
他們那些傢伙是哪種人
What kind of people are they?

684
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:58,320
我們嫁的不是上班族
We weren't married to nine-to-five guys.

685
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:01,260
讓我感到有多不同
But the first time I realized how different...

686
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,800
是在美琪的家庭聚會時
was when Mickey had a hostess party.

687
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:07,130
- 凱倫  你是哪裏人  - 勞倫斯
- Karen, where you from? - Lawrence.

688
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:11,570
在長島  不錯呀  我生在邁阿密  你去過嗎
On the Island. It's nice. I'm from Miami. You ever been there?

689
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:15,440
那裏還不錯  像個猶太天堂
It's okay, but it's like you died and woke up in Jew heaven.

690
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,340
不要老擠痘子嘛
Angie, stop picking at that thing.

691
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:19,880
我真想揍他的臉
I'd like to smack his face.

692
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:21,640
那個紅髮男人
The red-haired guy, looks like a farmer?

693
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,840
他都要動手動腳的
The guy's hands are all over me.

694
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:28,390
我說  不要對我動手  否則我把它切下來
So I told him, "Keep your fucking hands off me, or I'll cut them off."

695
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:31,390
她是認真的
She means it.

696
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,620
他不知道多走運  如果我告訴韋力
You don't know how lucky he is. I just mention this to Vinnie...

697
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,520
你怎麼能告訴韋力  他非殺了他不可
How can you mention it? Vinnie would kill him.

698
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,570
說出來  韋力殺了他  又得去坐一輩子牢
If I don't, he'll kill the miserable bastard, then Vinnie will be there for life.

699
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:45,370
你以為只有你有麻煩呀  珍妮的兒子更糟
You think you got problems. What about Jeannie's kid?

700
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:49,270
在一場只有10元輸贏的撲克中和人爭執起來  他拿出槍
He was in an argument. A $10 card game. He pulls out a gun.

701
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,240
槍走火  打死一個男孩  當他祖母聽到他在牢裏
The gun goes off. Some kid gets killed. When the grandmother hears it...

702
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:57,350
心臟病發作  當場就死了
and finds out he's jailed, she has a heart attack and drops dead right on the spot.

703
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,920
現在珍妮的老公和孩子在牢裏  媽媽在殯儀館
Now Jeannie has a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.

704
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,520
- 珍妮酗酒  - 也許她是心情不好
- Jeannie drinks. - Maybe she's depressed.

705
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:07,850
饒了我吧  她根本就是酗酒
Give me a break. She's drunk.

706
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:12,660
只要有點事發生  他們都成聖人了
As soon as something happens, you make them out to be saints.

707
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:17,770
她們皮膚粗糙  化妝太濃  氣色不好
They had bad skin and wore too much makeup. They didn't look very good.

708
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:20,730
她們看起來很憔悴  穿的衣服
They looked beat-up. And the stuff they wore...

709
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:22,770
也是不成套的廉價品
was thrown together and cheap.

710
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,610
都是些褲裝  針織品
A lot of pantsuits and double-knits.

711
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,240
她晝夜穿睡袍
She spends her life in a nightgown.

712
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,720
相信我  她不是什麼好東西
The woman is no angel, believe me.

713
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,380
她們談論著她們的孩子多壞
They talked about their rotten kids...

714
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,120
她們用掃把揍孩子  她們用皮鞭揍孩子
and about beating them with broom handles and belts.

715
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:40,230
但孩子們一點也不理會
And that the kids still didn't pay any attention.

716
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,290
當亨利來接我的時候  我整個頭都暈了
When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy.

717
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,130
我不知道我能不能適應這種生活
I don't know if I could live like that.

718
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:49,830
你要是進了監牢  我怎麼辦
God forbid, what would happen if you had to go to prison?

719
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,370
凱倫
Karen.

720
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,030
美琪談到了珍妮的丈夫
Mickey said that Jeannie's husband...

721
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:56,470
你知道怎麼回事嗎
Do you know why Jeannie's husband went to the can?

722
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,010
珍妮的丈夫是為了逃避珍妮才去坐牢的
Because of Jeannie. He wanted to get away from her.

723
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:04,910
你聽我說  坐牢的都是想坐牢的
Let me tell you something. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to.

724
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,190
都是甘願被捕的
Unless they make themselves get caught.

725
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:09,120
他們沒把事情安排好
They don't have things organized.

726
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:12,590
我都把事弄妥了
I know what I'm doing. I've got things organized with these guys.

727
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,000
你知道哪些人坐牢嗎
You know who goes to jail?

728
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,130
黑人搶劫犯  你知道他們為什麼會被捕嗎
Nigger stickup men. You know why they get caught?

729
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,990
因為他們在逃走用的車上睡著了
Because they fall asleep in the getaway car, Karen.

730
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,230
凱倫  不要瞎擔心了  甜心  過來吧
Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie. Come here.

731
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:33,430
漸漸地  一切都好像很正常了
After a while, it got to be all normal.

732
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,600
沒有一樣像犯罪
None of it seemed like crime.

733
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:39,070
亨利就像在經營企業
It was more like Henry was enterprising...

734
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,940
他和夥伴以詐騙為生而已
and that he and the guys made bucks hustling while other guys...

735
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:46,100
至少他們不坐著等別人來救濟
were sitting on their asses waiting for handouts.

736
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,870
我們的丈夫不是腦外科醫生  他們是靠努力賺錢的
Our husbands weren't brain surgeons, they were blue-collar guys.

737
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:55,620
他們只有多偷  多搶  才能多賺點錢
The only way they could make real extra money was to go out and cut corners.

738
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:58,650
錢箱在那裏  討人厭的東西
Where's the strong box, you varmint?

739
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:07,400
你他媽的別動
Don't fucking move! Don't move.

740
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,540
- 餐廳見了  - 我坐副駕駛座
- See you at the diner. - I'm riding shotgun.

741
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,380
你看他剛才立刻就服軟了
Did you see him give it right over?

742
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:25,210
走吧  回老巢去分錢吧
Back to the hideout to split up the loot.

743
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,460
我們非常親近
We were all so very close.

744
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:35,500
從來不跟外人來往  絕不
There were never any outsiders around. Absolutely never.

745
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:40,330
就因為這樣  一切好像更正常了
Being together all the time made everything seem all the more normal.

746
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,830
哈羅  希爾太太  警察
Hello, Mrs. Hill. Police.

747
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,300
我是迪西警探  他是席維思警探  我們有搜查令
I'm Detective Deacy. This is Detective Silvestri. We have a search warrant.

748
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,530
請看一下  然後簽名
Would you read and sign it?

749
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:50,180
- 哪裏都行嗎  - 是的
- Anywhere? - Yeah, anywhere.

750
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:52,910
要耽誤一點時間  我們每樣都要仔細查
This'll take a while, we have to go through everything.

751
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,140
- 你們要咖啡嗎  - 不用了  謝謝你
- You boys want some coffee? - No coffee now, thanks.

752
00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:00,310
- 請當心點  - 我們只是照常執行任務
- Be careful. - We'll just go about our business.

753
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:02,860
警察經常會找些小麻煩
There was always a little harassment.

754
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:05,820
他們要跟亨利談東談西
They wanted to talk to Henry about this or that.

755
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:09,230
他們帶著傳票和搜查令來叫我簽名
They'd make me sign their subpoenas or warrants.

756
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,760
不論他們搜到什麼
But mostly they just wanted a handout.

757
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:15,300
幾塊錢也就把他們打發了
A few bucks to keep things quiet no matter what they found.

758
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:25,510
我每次都問他們  要不要咖啡  有的太太  像美琪
I always asked if they wanted coffee. Some wives, like Mickey Conway...

759
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:28,550
她總是詛咒他們  還吐口水在地板上
used to curse at them and spit on the floor.

760
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,310
我永遠也不瞭解為什麼要吐在自己的地板上
She used to spit on her own floor. That never made any sense to me.

761
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:35,510
還是禮貌一點  然後打電話給律師比較好
It was better to be polite and call the lawyer.

762
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:49,130
我們總是在一起  總是同樣一群人
We always did everything together, and we always were in the same crowd.

763
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:53,260
紀念日  受洗等等  我們只到彼此的家去
Anniversaries, christenings. We only went to each other's houses.

764
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:56,740
女士們一起玩牌
The women played cards.

765
00:50:56,910 --> 00:51:00,970
凡有嬰兒誕生  美琪和吉米總是最先到醫院的
When kids were born, Mickey and Jimmy were the first at the hospital.

766
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:04,210
當我們去南海或賭城度假
When we went to the Islands or Vegas for vacation...

767
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:05,650
也都是一起的
we went together.

768
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:08,850
從來沒有外人  好像那才是正常的
No outsiders ever. It got to be normal.

769
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:12,050
我甚至對我丈夫的所作所為
It got to where I was proud that I had the kind of husband...

770
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:15,960
感到驕傲
who was willing to risk his neck just to get us the little extras.

771
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:20,060
我已經跟媽講好了  明晚來替我們看孩子
But I got Mom to watch the babies tomorrow night.

772
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,070
- 我沒辦法  凱倫  - 為什麼
- Can't do it, Karen. - Why not?

773
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,900
就是不行嘛  我已安排好別的事了
I just can't. I got something lined up.

774
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:28,540
但媽媽只有明晚可以替我們看孩子
But tomorrow's the only night she can do it.

775
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:32,270
- 拜託嘛  好不好  - 我真的不行  你要我怎麼辦
- Pretty please? - I can't. What do you want me to do?

776
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,840
- 我得走了  - 等一下
- I got to go. - Wait a minute.

777
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,320
我要去逛街  給我點錢好嗎
I wanted to go shopping. Can I get some money?

778
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:41,180
你需要多少
How much do you need?

779
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:44,860
- 多少  - 這麼多
- How much? - That much.

780
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,530
這麼多  親我一下
This much. Give me a kiss.

781
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:57,770
待會見
See you later.

782
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:04,070
好吧
All right.

783
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:20,750
紐約皇后區  1970年6月11日

784
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:38,150
歡迎你回來
Welcome home, Batts.

785
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,650
近來好嗎?
Hi, how are you?

786
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:45,450
坐下  喝一杯  給每個人一杯酒
Sit down. Have a drink. Give them all a drink.

787
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:48,580
那些愛爾蘭流氓  也給他們一杯
And give those Irish hoodlums a drink.

788
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,520
只有一個愛爾蘭人
There's only one Irishman here.

789
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:52,680
這是慶祝會  乾杯
It's a celebration, fellas.

790
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:55,990
- 祝你早安  - 從牢裏回來真好
- Top of the morning to you. - It's good to be home.

791
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,890
這是我朋友吉米
This is my friend Jimmy.

792
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:04,700
這裏是亨利的店  這是莉莎
Henry. It's his joint. This is Lisa.

793
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:07,700
湯米  這麼盛裝呀
Tommy. All dressed up.

794
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,850
已經是大人了  你看看
All grown up and doing the town. Look at this.

795
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:13,780
忘了你們在替他慶祝
Forgot you were having a party for this mug.

796
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,040
過來呀
Come here.

797
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:18,520
我過去打個招呼  比利  你好嗎
I'll say hello. Billy, how are you?

798
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:21,490
我已經六年沒見你了
Get over here. I haven't seen you in six years.

799
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:24,750
上帝  你看起來真神氣
Jesus Christ Almighty. You look terrific.

800
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:26,790
當心我的西裝
Watch the suit.

801
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:30,490
你這小混球  我認識你一輩子了
You little prick. I've known you all my life.

802
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,830
- 不要長得太大了  - 你不要找我麻煩就好了
- Don't get too big on me. - Just don't bust my balls.

803
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,030
如果我要找你麻煩  我會叫你回去拿擦鞋盒來
If I was gonna break your balls, I'd say, "Go get your shine box."

804
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,970
這小鬼以前鞋擦得真亮
This kid was great.

805
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:45,270
他外號叫  亮光湯米
They used to call him "Spitshine Tommy."

806
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:49,470
他媽的簡直像鏡子一樣  語氣稍粗了  抱歉
He'd make your shoes look like fucking mirrors. Excuse my language.

807
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:53,610
他真賺了不少錢
He was terrific. He was the best. He made a lot of money, too.

808
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,480
不要再提擦鞋了  比利
No more shines, Billy.

809
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,650
- 什麼  - 我說不要再提擦鞋了
- What? - I said no more shines.

810
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:01,560
你離開了很長一段時間  他們沒告訴你
You've been away a long time. They didn't tell you.

811
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:03,820
我不擦鞋了
I don't shine shoes anymore.

812
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:08,290
不要這麼認真好不好  只是好玩的  給你找點小麻煩而已
Relax. What's got into you? I'm breaking your balls a little, that's all.

813
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:09,770
我只是逗著你玩的
I'm only kidding with you.

814
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:13,270
有時你的語氣不像在玩  這裏有很多人  你知道嗎
Sometimes you don't sound like it. There's a lot of people around.

815
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,570
我只是跟你開玩笑  我們在慶祝
I'm only kidding. We're having a party.

816
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:19,480
我好久沒見你  只想逗逗你  你馬上就變臉了
I haven't seen you in a long time and you get fucking fresh.

817
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:21,580
對不起  我不是故意想惹你生氣
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

818
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:24,120
抱歉  沒事了  好了
I'm sorry, too. It's okay. No problem.

819
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,820
回去把你的擦鞋箱拿來
Now go home and get your fucking shine box.

820
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:32,520
你他媽的不是人養的
Motherfucking mutt!

821
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:35,090
你這攤大便
You fucking piece of shit!

822
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,560
來呀  來呀
Come on, come on!

823
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:41,430
誰不知道你用錢買到你在幫中的地位  假狠
He bought his fucking button! That fake old tough guy!

824
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,900
誰不知道你用錢買到你在幫中的地位
You bought your fucking button!

825
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:46,370
- 別緊張  - 你這個蓄生
- Don't get nervous. - You motherfucker!

826
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:49,310
把這王八蛋留在這裏
Keep that motherfucker here! Keep him here.

827
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:52,970
來呀  你以為你很強嗎
Come on, you fucking feel strong?

828
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:56,280
湯米喝太多了  他並沒惡意
Sorry. Tommy gets a little loaded. He doesn't mean any disrespect.

829
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:58,940
他沒有惡意  你瘋啦
He doesn't mean any disrespect? Are you nuts?

830
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:02,550
應該教這小子一點禮貌  對就是對
Teach this kid a little fucking manners. What's right is right.

831
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,160
- 你知道我的意思吧  - 沒關係
- You understand what I'm saying? - It's all right.

832
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:09,730
我是說那小子兩分鐘前還跟我行貼面禮  一轉臉就六親不認了
We're hugging and kissing over here and then he acts like a fucking jerk.

833
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:14,530
那是因為你諷刺他  你自己也有不對
You insulted him a little bit. You got a little out of order.

834
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,970
- 哪有  - 你有一點諷刺他
- I didn't. - You insulted him a little.

835
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:20,400
- 我沒諷刺任何人  給我們來酒  - 好的
- I didn't insult anybody. Give us a drink. - Okay.

836
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,070
我們都來一杯吧  我請客
Let's have some drinks. Drinks on the house.

837
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:25,300
不  由我來請
No, have the drink with me.

838
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,480
比利  酒免費
The drinks are on the house.

839
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:33,280
我在牢裏都強姦那種小子
I fucked kids like that in the can. In the ass.

840
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:35,610
他媽的  敢破壞我的慶祝會
Fucking break up my party.

841
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,630
時代變了  你離開六年了
You've been away for six years. It's different now.

842
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,130
我已經被懲罰過了
I did my fucking time, Jimmy.

843
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:53,130
我回來了  我要我該有的一份  我得養家餬口
I came home and I want what I got to get. I got mouths to feed.

844
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:55,970
- 你會得到的  - 你能瞭解吧
- You're gonna get it. - You understand?

845
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:00,440
關上門
Get the door!

846
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,700
讓我把子彈射進他的大爛嘴巴
Let me shoot him in his big, fucking mouth!

847
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:19,420
槍斃了他
Let's shoot him.

848
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:39,320
死傢伙把我鞋弄凹了
Fucking mutt dented my shoes.

849
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:42,080
他手下的人會到處找他的
His whole crew is going to be looking for him.

850
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:48,830
真糟糕  怎麼處理他  總不能把他丟在街上
This is bad. What do we do with him? We can't just dump him on the street.

851
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,590
我知道郊外有個地方  誰也找不到  再拿幾張桌布
I know a place upstate. They'll never find him. More tablecloths.

852
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:55,400
我本來不想把血濺在你地板上
I didn't want to get blood on your floor.

853
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:00,940
去把你的車廂打開
Go open your trunk.

854
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:07,040
到我媽媽家去拿一把鏟子
We'll get a shovel at my mother's house.

855
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:20,380
她有一把鏟子就放在附近  小聲一點  別把她吵醒
She has a shovel here somewhere. Quiet, I don't want to wake her up.

856
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,760
看誰來了
Look who's here.

857
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,940
你們剛才在做什麼  發生了什麼事
What did you do? What happened?

858
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,630
我在路上撞了一隻動物  吉米會告訴你
I hit something on the road. Jimmy will tell you.

859
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:33,000
發生什麼事了
What happened to him?

860
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:37,910
我好久沒看到你了  他怎麼啦
I haven't seen you in so long. What happened to him?

861
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,940
你好嗎
You, too. How are you?

862
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,340
你怎麼這麼晚還不睡
Why are you up so late?

863
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:45,820
他來了  你們都來了  我好高興看到他
He came in. You came in. I'm so happy to see him.

864
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:49,860
快進來吧  不要客氣  我給你們弄點吃的
Go inside. Make yourselves comfortable. I'll make you something to eat.

865
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:52,760
- 你去睡吧  - 我睡不著  我好久沒看到他了
- Go to sleep. We're leaving. - I can't. Not while he's home.

866
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:55,230
我好久沒看到他了  我想陪陪他
I haven't seen him in so long. I want to see him.

867
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,630
你們進去吧
You go inside.

868
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,100
你們進去吧
This stuff is like lead.

869
00:57:58,270 --> 00:58:01,360
告訴我  你去哪裏了  我都沒看見你
Tell me, where you been? I haven't seen you.

870
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:04,230
也不打個電話回來  你都去哪了
You haven't called. Where have you been?

871
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:07,310
- 我在上夜班  - 然後呢
- I been working nights. - And?

872
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,270
今晚我們開車到郊外溜達
And tonight we were out late.

873
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,880
撞上一隻鹿
We took a ride out to the country and hit a deer.

874
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:16,040
所以才有這些血  吉米不也告訴你了嗎
That's where all the blood is from. Jimmy told you.

875
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:19,850
對了  我要借這把刀用一下  好嗎
It reminds me, I need this knife. I'm taking this, okay?

876
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:21,890
- 用吧  - 我只需要用一下就好
- Okay. - Just for a while.

877
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:23,460
可憐的鹿
The poor thing.

878
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:27,390
我們撞到那隻鹿的  那個  那個叫什麼
We hit the deer and his paw... What do you call it?

879
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,150
前爪
The paw.

880
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:31,770
- 鹿蹄  - 他前蹄被卡住了
- The hoof. - Got caught in the grill.

881
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:33,760
我必須把它切下來
I got to hack it off.

882
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:36,200
如果不管它  那太不人道了
Ma, it's a sin to leave it there.

883
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:38,240
刀用完我就送回來
I'll bring the knife back.

884
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:40,570
- 真好吃  美味  - 謝謝你
- Delicious. - Thank you.

885
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:42,970
你為什麼不找個好姑娘
Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?

886
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,980
我每天晚上都找好姑娘
I do, almost every night.

887
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:47,670
我是說找個好女孩  能結婚安定下來
But get yourself a girl so you could settle down.

888
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:50,740
我每晚都安定下來  然後早上又自由了
I do, every night. Then I'm free.

889
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,720
我愛你  只想和你在一起
I love you, I want to be with you.

890
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:54,320
安定一下自己啦
Settle down.

891
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:57,820
亨利怎麼樣呀
How's your friend Henry?

892
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:00,360
怎麼了  你不怎麼講話
What's the matter? You don't talk much.

893
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:02,290
對啊  這麼安靜做什麼
Talk. What are you quiet for?

894
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,900
他吃得少  說話也少
You don't eat much, you don't talk much.

895
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:07,560
- 我聽著就好了  - 有什麼不對勁嗎
- I'm just listening. - Something wrong?

896
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:11,260
你讓我想起我們小的時候  從意大利來的人都很親近
When we were kids, the compares used to visit each other.

897
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:16,240
有一個人從來不說話  他整晚坐著一句話都不說
There was this man. He would never talk. He'd just sit there all night, not a word.

898
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:20,950
有人問他  你哪裏不對勁呀  你會不會說話
They say to him, "What's the matter? Don't you say anything?"

899
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:25,250
他說  你要我說什麼  說我老婆愛偷情
He says, "What am I going to say, that my wife two-times me?"

900
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:29,150
他老婆說  閉嘴  你話太多了
So she says, "Shut up! You're always talking."

901
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:33,520
不過這句話用意大利語說出來好聽多了
But in Italian, it sounds much nicer.

902
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,220
- 自得其樂  - 就是 滿於現況 的意思
- Cornuto contento. - That's it.

903
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,030
- 什麼意思呀  - 就是連那樣他都滿足
- What does that mean? - It means he's content to be a jerk.

904
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,130
別人怎麼想  他才不在乎
He doesn't care who knows it.

905
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,100
- 湯米有沒有告訴你們我畫畫  - 沒有
- Did Tommy tell you about my painting? - No.

906
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:47,600
看看這個
Look at this.

907
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:49,140
真漂亮
It's beautiful.

908
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:52,340
一隻狗臉朝這邊  另一隻臉朝那邊
I like it. One dog goes one way and the other goes the other.

909
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:54,910
一隻想到東部  一隻想到西部  又怎樣咧
One's facing east, the other west. So what?

910
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:58,520
這人在說  你要我怎麼樣  他那頭白髮挺漂亮的
He's saying, "What do you want from me?" The guy's got nice white hair.

911
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:00,850
漂亮  那隻狗  看起來差不多
Beautiful. The dog looks the same.

912
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:03,010
這個人有點像我們認識的一個人
Looks like somebody we know.

913
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,890
去掉鬍子不就是他嗎
Without the beard. It's him.

914
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:10,730
就是他
It's him.

915
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,570
媽的  什麼聲音啊
What the fuck is that?

916
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:24,340
對大部分兄弟來說  殺人是被接受的
For most of the guys, killings were accepted.

917
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:27,210
要令每個人服從  只有用處決來控制
Murder was the only way everybody stayed in line.

918
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:30,650
你如果越軌就會被除掉  規則大家都知道
You got out of line, you got whacked. Everybody knew the rules.

919
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:34,260
有時候沒越軌也會被除掉
Sometimes, even if people didn't get out of line, they got whacked.

920
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:38,860
有些兄弟已是殺人成性  動不動就挑釁
Hits became a habit. Guys would get into arguments over nothing.

921
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:41,220
時常  轉眼就死了一個人
Before you knew it, one was dead.

922
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,590
彼此常以槍相對
They were shooting each other all the time.

923
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:47,330
早已習以為常  不值得大驚小怪
Shooting people was a normal thing. It was no big deal.

924
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,770
我們跟比利·貝茲的事可不是件小事情
We had a serious problem with Billy Batts.

925
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:56,040
湯米殺的是個大人物  地位很高的
This was really a touchy thing. Tommy killed a made guy.

926
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:59,770
貝茲是坎必諾家族的一員  這種人是不能隨便殺的
Batts was part of the Gambino crew and was considered untouchable.

927
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:04,010
你得有充分的理由
Before you touched a made guy, you had to have a good reason.

928
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:06,920
你得有上面正式的許可
You had to have a sit-down and you'd better get an okay...

929
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:09,420
否則  被殺的人就是你
or you'd be the one who got whacked.

930
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,470
星期六是太太之夜
Saturday night was for wives...

931
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,800
禮拜五是女朋友之夜
but Friday night at the Copa was for the girlfriends.

932
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:30,870
上星期我們看了山米·戴維斯的秀
Last week, we saw Sammy Davis, Jr.

933
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:33,950
太值得看了  好會表演
You got to see this show. What a performer.

934
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:37,610
他會模仿別人  聽起來就跟真人一樣
He does these impersonations. You'd think it was the real people.

935
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:41,880
真令人難以相信  難怪白人女孩為他傾心
It's unbelievable. You could see how a white girl could fall for him.

936
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:43,320
什麼
What?

937
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:48,420
我不是說我  只是有的女孩  像那個瑞典女孩
Not me. But you could see how some girls could. Like that Swedish girl.

938
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:50,760
換句話說  你贊同那種黑白關係
So you condone that stuff.

939
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:52,260
別那麼認真
Take it easy.

940
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:56,840
我不要間接跟黑人接吻
I don't want to be kissing Nat King Cole over here.

941
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:58,670
我又不是在說我自己
No, I'm not talking about me.

942
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:02,240
他很有個性
But, you know, he's got personality.

943
01:02:02,410 --> 01:02:04,110
個性
Personality?

944
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:08,310
他非常有才氣  我完全明白
He's talented. I understand what you're saying.

945
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,850
不過你要注意你所說的話  別人很容易誤會
But watch what you say. People get the wrong impression.

946
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:14,420
我只是說他很有才氣  令人難以相信
I just said he was talented, you're unbelievable.

947
01:02:14,590 --> 01:02:17,080
你說夠了吧  你說的我都懂
Just leave it alone now, I understand what you said.

948
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:19,230
他很有才氣  就這樣子
He's talented. Leave it at that.

949
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:00,160
連給保利叔叔親一下都不行
No? Not even Uncle Paulie?

950
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:19,080
你有沒有聽到什麼消息
What did you hear about that thing?

951
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:22,770
- 布魯克林的事嗎  - 不是  城中那傢伙的事
- The Brooklyn thing? - No, the guy from downtown.

952
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:26,610
- 克莉絲家附近那傢伙嗎  - 不是
- The guy from where Christie lived? - No.

953
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,990
失蹤的那個傢伙  也就是曾經被警察逮捕定罪的那個傢伙
The guy who disappeared, the one they made the beef on.

954
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:33,660
- 你認得那個人嗎  - 是呀
- Know the guy I mean? - Yeah.

955
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:37,890
他叫貝茲  他手下的人像瘋了一樣到處找他
His name was Batts. His people are driving everyone crazy looking for him.

956
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:39,760
沒人知道他去哪裏了
Nobody knows what happened to him.

957
01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:44,000
有天晚上他到我店來過  他走之後就失蹤了
He came into the joint that night and then just disappeared. That was it.

958
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:49,970
好  眼睛放亮一點  他們一直來跟我囉嗦
All right. Keep your eyes open. They're busting my balls over it.

959
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,470
- 好嗎  - 我會的
- All right? - Yeah.

960
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:57,080
好吧  大家來吃吧
Okay, everybody, let's eat.

961
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,920
我要我的錢
I want my money.

962
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:07,390
他欠我
He owes it.

963
01:05:16,270 --> 01:05:19,070
還記得郊外那件事嗎
You know that thing we took care of upstate?

964
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:22,570
- 保利剛才還提到呢  - 我們得把他挖出來
- Paulie was talking about that. - Got to get it out of there.

965
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,840
那塊地就要開始建大廈了
They just sold the property to make condominiums.

966
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:29,680
- 已經六個月了呀  - 我們要馬上把他移走
- It's been six months. - We got to get it out of there right away.

967
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:46,530
亨利  快點好不好  我媽要給我們炸香腸吃
Henry, hurry up. My mother's making fried peppers and sausage for us.

968
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:52,330
- 這有隻手臂  - 很好笑呀
- Here's an arm. - Very funny, guys.

969
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:53,910
這兒有條腿
Here's a leg.

970
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,570
這兒有只翅膀
Here's a wing.

971
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:00,610
你喜歡什麼  大腿還是翅膀  心還是肺
What do you like, the leg or the wing? Or you still go for the hearts and lungs?

972
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,710
真臭死了
Oh, that's so bad.

973
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:12,390
車子怎麼了
What happened to the car?

974
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:14,520
我撞死了一隻臭鼬
I hit a skunk, all right?

975
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,430
跟媽媽走吧
Go with your mother.

976
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:19,300
真是噁心死了  亨利
It's disgusting, Henry.

977
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,330
我把珍麗絲安頓在離家不遠的公寓裏
I set up Janice in an apartment around the corner from The Suite.

978
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:29,140
那樣我每星期可以在她那兒過夜一兩次
That way I was able to stay over a couple of nights a week.

979
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:30,540
這是新買的古董檯燈
This is my new antique lamp.

980
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:33,770
凱倫從來不過問我的事  她只在家裏帶孩子
Karen was home with the kids. She never asked questions.

981
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:35,780
傢俱都是設計家摩瑞斯的作品
The furniture's all Maurice Valencia.

982
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,540
好像是羅馬的作品
Looks like Roma.

983
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:39,980
這些都是真絲的  從暹羅進口的
This is all silk. This is from Siam.

984
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:43,750
來看我的臥房
Come see my bedroom.

985
01:06:44,490 --> 01:06:48,330
- 湯米  你抱他一下好嗎  - 我今晚就把他吃掉
- Tommy, will you take him? - I'll eat this fucking dog tonight.

986
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,430
喜歡那個水晶球嗎
Love that crystal ball or what?

987
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:58,910
我們多數時間都是在這裏消磨的
This is where we spend most of our time.

988
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:03,010
那盆花插得真美
I love the floral arrangements.

989
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:06,040
法國貨呀
French.

990
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:10,120
珍麗絲只顧和我一起玩樂  工作上出軌了
Janice and I were having so much fun, she started screwing up at work.

991
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,780
我只好去給她老闆一點教訓
I had to straighten out her boss a little bit.

992
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:16,480
珍麗絲喜歡怎麼做  她就可以怎麼做  你懂嗎
Janice can do what she wants to do. Got it?

993
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:21,030
隨便你往哪裏跑  如果你再掛我的電話  你試試看
Just try to run. Hang up once more, and you'll deal with me.

994
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,830
好了啦  放開她
Come on, get off of her.

995
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,870
你真是個野獸
You're an animal.

996
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:47,580
小蜘蛛  過來帶杯酒給我
Spider, on your way over here, bring me a Cutty and water.

997
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:52,360
- 你們吃飯了沒有  - 我餓死了
- Did you guys eat? - I'm starving.

998
01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:56,090
- 打就打啦  - 那些你也能打
- I'll play these. - You'll play those?

999
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:58,320
我有口吃嗎  那些我都打
Do I stutter? I play those.

1000
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:04,100
我是什麼  我不存在呀
What am I? A mirage?

1001
01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:07,000
什麼  我的酒呢
Where's my fucking drink? I asked you for a drink.

1002
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:09,840
- 你有說要酒嗎  - 我剛才跟你說要酒呀
- You wanted a drink? - I asked you for one.

1003
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:12,910
我以為你是說  我不用了  小蜘蛛
I thought you said, "I'm all right, Spider."

1004
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:15,650
你把我例入不用理會的名單嗎
Am I on a pay-no-mind list?

1005
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:20,020
不是的  我聽到有人叫  小蜘蛛  小蜘蛛
No, I heard someone say "Spider, Spider."

1006
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:23,490
- 我以為是亨利在叫吧  - 你簡直是又笨又口吃的蠢貨
- I thought it was Henry. - You're a mumbling, stuttering little fuck.

1007
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:25,720
我以為你說  我不用了  小蜘蛛
I thought you said, "I'm all right, Spider."

1008
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:27,550
你麻煩大了
You ain't all right.

1009
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:29,890
我真的以為你說  沒事了
No, I thought you said you were all right.

1010
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:33,000
我是沒事  你就有事了
I am all right! You ain't, you prick.

1011
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:38,200
你說了一晚上了  小王八蛋
You've been doing this all fucking night to me, you motherfucker!

1012
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:40,530
你現在要不要酒  我去給你拿
He wants a drink now? I'll bring it.

1013
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:43,340
去給我倒酒  快點呀  你個小混球
Go get me a fucking drink! Move it, you little prick.

1014
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:46,070
你走路好像史帝芬·費區一樣慢
You walk like fucking Stepin Fetchit.

1015
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:48,110
為我跑快點行不行
For everybody else you run.

1016
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:51,910
一面跳舞一面抱酒拿過來!
Run for me, you prick! Dance, dance the fucking drink back here!

1017
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:53,920
像鮑嘉在什麼電影裏一樣
What's that movie that Bogart made?

1018
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:56,720
- 就是他扮牛仔那部  - 奧克拉荷馬小子
- Where he played a cowboy. - The Oklahoma Kid.

1019
01:08:56,890 --> 01:09:00,920
- 奧克拉荷馬小子  史恩  - 我就是奧克拉荷馬小子
- Shane? - Oklahoma Kid, that's me!

1020
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:03,690
你這沒用的東西  跳舞呀
You fucking varmint. Dance!

1021
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:05,830
你這混蛋
Yahoo, you motherfucker!

1022
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:08,500
把小孩和婦女藏妥
Round up those fucking wagons.

1023
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:16,240
現在他動作可快了
Now he's moving.

1024
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:19,810
- 亨利  怎麼樣了  - 你打中他的腳了  湯米
- Henry, what happened? - He shot him in the foot, Tommy.

1025
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:24,210
他沒事啦  腳被射中了又怎樣  算是件大事嗎  是不是
He's fucking fine. So he got shot in the foot. What is it? A big fucking deal?

1026
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:26,910
- 維多  拿條毛巾來  - 玩得好
- Get a towel. - Nice fucking game.

1027
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:30,290
帶他去看寶凱西醫生吧
Take him to Ben Casey, the little prick.

1028
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:33,160
讓他爬去  就像他拿酒的時候一樣慢慢爬
Let him crawl like he crawls for the drinks.

1029
01:09:33,690 --> 01:09:36,390
帶他去看街口那個醫生
Take him to the doctor down the street.

1030
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,530
我的腳骨頭全碎了
Bones are all shattered.

1031
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:40,500
不要再惹我生氣了
Don't get me upset, now.

1032
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:44,230
沒什麼大不了的  小蜘蛛  你這小混球
Don't make a big fucking thing out of it, Spider, you little prick.

1033
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:47,070
你們想要我為這件事抱歉嗎
You trying to make me think what the fuck I did here.

1034
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,110
那只是件意外而已
It was an accident.

1035
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,640
- 別演戲了  小子  - 我這手牌很不錯
- Little fucking actor. - I got a great hand here.

1036
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:53,210
- 這一手你跟不跟呀  - 跟了
- You in or out? - Yeah, I'm in.

1037
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:55,280
- 800元  - 800元
- $800. - $800?

1038
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:59,650
你已經兩星期沒回家了  今天晚上不准出去!
You haven't been home in two weeks. You're not going out tonight!

1039
01:10:00,150 --> 01:10:03,250
凱倫  別孩子氣好不好  我還是要出去的
Karen, will you grow up! Stop! I'm still gonna go out!

1040
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:05,320
車鑰匙不給你  你去呀
Not without your car keys, you're not.

1041
01:10:05,490 --> 01:10:07,480
你瘋啦  是不是
Are you nuts? What's your problem?

1042
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:09,860
是  我是瘋了  你在玩什麼花樣
Yes, I'm nuts. Something's going on.

1043
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:12,970
- 別說了  夠了  不要說了  - 不好
- Stop with that. Enough! Stop with that. - No!

1044
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:16,830
我告訴你  我看你的臉  就知道你在說謊
I'm telling you, I look in your face and I know that you're lying!

1045
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:21,270
- 滾出去  - 閉嘴
- Get out! Get out! - Shut up.

1046
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,570
滾出我的生活
Get out of my life!

1047
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:25,580
你昏頭了  一切都是你想像出來的
You're fucked in the head, Karen. This is all in your mind.

1048
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:28,210
- 你是個低級的混蛋  - 你腦子有問題
- You're a lousy bastard! - You got a problem.

1049
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:32,180
去呀  去找你的現成妓女呀  你只配找那種女人
Go ahead, go to your ready-made whores. That's all you're good for!

1050
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:35,880
滾出我的生活  我不能忍受你了
Get out of my life! I can't stand you!

1051
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:48,460
小蜘蛛  急什麼嘛
Spider, what's your rush?

1052
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,100
- 給你  - 謝謝你  小蜘蛛
- Here you go. - Thank you, Spider.

1053
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:57,470
小蜘蛛  你腳上的紗布包得比你的頭還大
Spider, that fucking bandage on your foot is bigger than your fucking head.

1054
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:03,250
下一次他就要用手杖來走路了
Next thing you know, he's gonna be coming in one of these fucking walkers.

1055
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:05,180
雖然你腳受傷了  你還是可以跳舞吧
Even though you got that, you can dance?

1056
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:09,920
給我們表演幾步  你這個裝模作樣的混球
Give us a couple of fucking steps, Spider. You fucking bullshitter, you.

1057
01:11:10,190 --> 01:11:12,390
說實話吧  你是希望大家同情你
Tell the truth. You're looking for sympathy?

1058
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,820
你去操你自己吧  湯米
Why don't you go fuck yourself, Tommy?

1059
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:22,030
我不相信我所聽到的
I didn't fucking hear right. Can't believe what I heard.

1060
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,690
小蜘蛛  這個給你  有種
Spider, here. This is for you. Attaboy.

1061
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:28,470
我看得起這小子  有勇氣
I got respect for this kid. He's got a lot of fucking balls.

1062
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:31,130
不吃任何人這一套
Good for you. Don't take no shit off nobody.

1063
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:35,110
他打中他的腳  他叫他去操自己
He shoots him in the foot, he tells him to go fuck himself.

1064
01:11:36,650 --> 01:11:39,980
你就讓這小混球這樣罵你
Are you gonna let this fucking punk get away with that?

1065
01:11:40,150 --> 01:11:42,750
你怎麼回事呀  這成什麼世界啦
What's the matter? What's the world coming to?

1066
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:49,420
就成這樣的世界  你認為如何
That's what the fucking world is coming to. How do you like that?

1067
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,860
- 行了吧  - 你發瘋啦你
- How's that, all right? - What's the fucking matter with you?

1068
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:54,970
你是笨蛋還是什麼
What are you, stupid or what?

1069
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:58,400
湯米  我是在跟你開玩笑  你是神經不正常了是不是
Tommy, I'm kidding with you. Are you a fucking sick maniac?

1070
01:11:58,570 --> 01:12:01,540
我怎麼知道你是開玩笑  你是在糗我
How do I know if you're kidding? You're breaking my fucking balls?

1071
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:04,200
我在開你的玩笑  你卻開槍
I'm fucking kidding with you, you fucking shoot the guy?

1072
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:05,570
他死了
He's dead.

1073
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:09,710
射得真準  你要我怎麼辦嘛  我就是准
Good shot. I'm a lucky man. Good shot.

1074
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,150
這種距離會射不準嗎
You can't miss at this distance.

1075
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,080
怎麼  你有什麼意見嗎
You got a problem with what I did, Anthony?

1076
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:14,280
沒有
No.

1077
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:18,190
反正是個爛人  他全家都是告密者
Fucking rat. His whole family's all rats. He would've grown up to be a rat.

1078
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,520
真是蠢到極點了  我真不敢相信你會做這種事
Stupid bastard! I can't fucking believe you.

1079
01:12:20,690 --> 01:12:24,560
你自己去挖坑吧  我沒法處理
Now you're going to dig the hole. I got no fucking lime.

1080
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:28,900
誰在乎  我自己會挖坑  這又不是我第一次挖坑
I'll dig the hole. I don't give a fuck. Is it the first hole I dug?

1081
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,970
我去挖就是了  鏟子在哪
I'll dig the fucking hole. Where are the shovels?

1082
01:12:33,010 --> 01:12:34,570
- 哈羅  - 哈羅
- Hello. - Hello?

1083
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:37,300
這是凱倫·希爾  我要跟你談談
This is Karen Hill. I wanna talk to you.

1084
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:41,180
哈羅  不要掛上
Hello? Don't hang up on me!

1085
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:43,180
我要和你說話
I want to talk to you!

1086
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:46,280
你離我丈夫遠一點  聽見沒有
You keep away from my husband, you hear me?

1087
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:50,010
哈羅  把門打開
Hello? Open the door!

1088
01:12:51,890 --> 01:12:53,330
回答我
Answer me!

1089
01:12:53,890 --> 01:12:56,260
我要告訴每一個走進大樓的人
I'm gonna tell everyone who walks in this building...

1090
01:12:56,430 --> 01:12:59,130
住在2R的羅茜是妓女
that in 2R, Rossi, you are nothing but a whore!

1091
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:00,930
是不是管理員
Is this the superintendent?

1092
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:03,470
我是要告訴你  有個妓女
Yes, I want you to know, sir, that you have a whore...

1093
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,160
住在你大廈的2R房間
living in 2R!

1094
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:08,470
羅茜  珍麗絲·羅茜  你聽見了嗎
Rossi, Janice Rossi. Do you hear me?

1095
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:10,430
他是我丈夫
He's my husband!

1096
01:13:10,610 --> 01:13:13,310
有本事自己找個男人
Get your own goddamn man!

1097
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:16,070
醒醒  亨利
Wake up, Henry.

1098
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:36,770
- 凱倫  你瘋啦  - 我是瘋了
- Karen, are you crazy? - I am crazy.

1099
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:40,670
瘋得足以殺掉你們
I'm crazy enough to kill both of you.

1100
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:45,340
凱倫  別動氣好不好
Karen, take it easy.

1101
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:50,820
- 好不好  - 你愛不愛她
- Okay? - Do you love her?

1102
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:53,580
愛不愛
Do you?

1103
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:56,680
- 愛不愛  - 凱倫
- Do you? - Karen...

1104
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,390
我愛你  你知道我愛你的
I love you. You know I love you.

1105
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,290
你不愛我
You don't.

1106
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:07,530
不  你不愛我
No, you don't.

1107
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:10,870
當心點  凱倫  求求你
Please, be careful. Baby, don't.

1108
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:14,970
我還是沒辦法傷害他
But still I couldn't hurt him. How could I hurt him?

1109
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:17,840
我連離開他的勇氣都沒有
I couldn't even bring myself to leave him.

1110
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:19,410
說實在的
The truth was...

1111
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,880
不管我再怎麼生氣
that no matter how bad I felt...

1112
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:25,110
他對我還是有吸引力
I was still very attracted to him.

1113
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:28,620
我為什麼要拱手把他讓給她呢
Why should I give him to someone else?

1114
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:30,620
誰說要她贏我輸
Why should she win?

1115
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:36,190
把槍放下來
Just put it down.

1116
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,800
你知道我是愛你的  不是嗎
You know I love you, don't you?

1117
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:42,090
我全心全意只要你
You're all I want, Karen.

1118
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:45,730
凱倫  請把槍放下來
Please put the gun down, Karen.

1119
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:49,270
拜託啦  寶貝
Baby, come on.

1120
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:05,660
你是瘋了是不是  凱倫
What are you, fucking crazy, Karen?

1121
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:09,830
外面的事就夠叫我提心吊膽的了
I got enough to worry about getting whacked on the street!

1122
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,660
我回來還要面對這個
I got to fucking come home for this?

1123
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,230
我真該殺了你
I should fucking kill you!

1124
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,340
這是什麼滋味
How does it feel?

1125
01:15:20,370 --> 01:15:22,340
這是什麼滋味  凱倫
How does it feel, Karen?

1126
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,890
我很抱歉
I'm sorry!

1127
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:49,870
吉米  你好嗎
Hi, Jimmy! How are you?

1128
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:53,730
- 看來挺好嘛  - 謝謝  很高興見到你
- Looking good. - Thank you. Good to see you.

1129
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:56,400
- 保利  - 甜心  你好吧
- Hi, Paulie! - Hi, honey. How are you?

1130
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:57,530
很好呀
Good.

1131
01:15:57,710 --> 01:16:00,370
- 你去幫我買包香煙好嗎  - 好
- Why don't you go get cigarettes, okay? - Sure.

1132
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:03,740
- 你們需要什麼嗎  - 不用
- Any of you need anything? - I'm all right.

1133
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,950
- 你們要喝什麼嗎  啤酒  - 不用
- Want anything to drink? A beer? - No.

1134
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,680
- 來點中國菜  - 不用  過來坐下
- Chinese food? - No, come on, sit down.

1135
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:18,430
凱倫來看我了
Karen came to the house.

1136
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:19,900
她很氣憤
She's very upset.

1137
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:22,600
這樣很不好  你要把你們的問題解決一下
This is no good. You gotta straighten this thing out.

1138
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:26,040
我們一定要冷靜  她什麼事都做得出來
We got to have calm now. We don't know what the hell she's gonna do.

1139
01:16:26,210 --> 01:16:28,440
她已經歇斯底里了  很容易興奮
She's getting all hysterical. She gets very excited.

1140
01:16:28,610 --> 01:16:32,510
她很激動  你就得慢慢來  別忘了還有孩子
She's wild. And you got to take it easy. You got children.

1141
01:16:33,450 --> 01:16:36,850
我不是說要你馬上回去  不過你還是非回去不可
I'm not saying you gotta back to her this minute, but you gotta go back.

1142
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:39,450
你別無選擇  你得注意自己的形象
It's the only way. You gotta keep up appearances.

1143
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:42,110
凱倫跟美琪每天到我家來訴苦
The two of them come over every day, commiserating.

1144
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:44,220
我受不了了
I can't have it.

1145
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:47,720
亨利  我不能那樣
I can't do it, Henry.

1146
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:50,960
沒人說你不能做你喜歡的
Nobody says that you can't do what you wanna do.

1147
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:53,760
我們知道是怎麼回事
We all know that. I mean, this is what it is.

1148
01:16:53,930 --> 01:16:56,700
可是你要面面俱到
We know what it is. You have to do the right thing.

1149
01:16:56,870 --> 01:16:59,200
你不能不顧到你的家庭  懂嗎
You have to go home to the family, you understand?

1150
01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:01,970
你就是得回家  知道嗎
You got to go home, okay? Look at me.

1151
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,510
你就是得回家  放聰明一點
You gotta go home. Smarten up.

1152
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:06,740
- 好嗎  - 好吧
- All right? - All right.

1153
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:08,440
我會跟凱倫講講
I'm gonna talk to Karen.

1154
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:12,140
我會把事擺平  我知道該對她說些什麼
I'll straighten this out. I know just what to say to her.

1155
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:14,640
我會說你願意回去
I'm gonna tell her you'll go back to her...

1156
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:17,720
一切跟以前一樣
and it'll be just the way it was when you were first married...

1157
01:17:17,890 --> 01:17:19,720
我會說得很動人  會很圓滿的
your romance, it's gonna be beautiful.

1158
01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:21,920
跟她談  我很有把握
I know how to talk to her, especially to her.

1159
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:24,590
吉米跟湯米要到天波城
Jimmy and Tommy are going down to Tampa this weekend...

1160
01:17:24,730 --> 01:17:25,860
去幫我拿東西
to pick up something for me.

1161
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:27,730
你代替湯米和吉米去好了
Instead, you go with Jimmy.

1162
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:29,130
你來和我一起去吧
You come with me, we'll go down.

1163
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:31,860
好好玩玩  讓自己輕鬆一下
Have a good time. Take some time for yourself. Relax.

1164
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:33,840
在太陽底下好好休息
Sit in the sun. Take a couple days off.

1165
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:35,870
- 我們會玩得很愉快的  - 好好玩
- We'll have a good time. - Enjoy yourselves.

1166
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,570
但當你回來時  你就要回到凱倫身邊
And when you come back, you go back to Karen.

1167
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:41,010
拜託你了  別無他法
Please, there's no other way.

1168
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:43,780
你不能離婚  我們不是禽獸
You're not gonna get a divorce. We're not animali.

1169
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:46,510
他們不會離婚  她永遠不會同意離婚
No divorce. She'll never divorce him.

1170
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:51,220
她會殺了他  但不會跟他離婚
She'll kill him, but she won't divorce him.

1171
01:17:55,530 --> 01:17:57,120
你到底付不付
You gonna pay us?

1172
01:17:57,300 --> 01:18:00,360
佛羅里達州天波市  兩天後

1173
01:18:03,570 --> 01:18:06,600
- 你付錢呀  - 快把錢給我們
- You gonna pay? - Give us the fucking money!

1174
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:09,170
我沒有  我真的沒有
I can't, I swear.

1175
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:12,010
我們走
Let's go.

1176
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:15,310
天波市立動物園

1177
01:18:20,590 --> 01:18:23,250
- 我們把這個雜種丟給獅子  - 不要呀
- We'll throw the bastard to the lions. - No!

1178
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:26,120
什麼獅子  我可不要進去  吉米
What fucking lions? I ain't going near any lions, Jimmy!

1179
01:18:26,290 --> 01:18:28,630
- 把他丟過分界溝就行了  - 那好
- Let's throw him over the moat. - All right.

1180
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,160
我一定把錢給你們
I'll get the money!

1181
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:32,960
一定要有人被喂獅子
They must really feed each other to the lions down there...

1182
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:34,860
那傢伙馬上就付錢了
because the guy gave the money right up.

1183
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,660
我對上帝發誓我會付錢
I swear to Christ, I'll get the money.

1184
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,960
我們在賽馬場度週末
We got to spend the rest of the weekend at the track.

1185
01:18:39,370 --> 01:18:40,700
他們不是開玩笑的
Yeah. They mean business.

1186
01:18:40,870 --> 01:18:43,500
接著發生的真的難以相信
Then, I couldn't believe what happened.

1187
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:46,440
當我們回到家的時候  我們已經是新聞人物了
When we got home, we were all over the newspaper.

1188
01:18:46,610 --> 01:18:49,810
最初  我根本不知道那邊會跟媒體有牽連
At first, I didn't even know why we got picked up.

1189
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:52,110
後來才知道被我們揍的人的姐姐
Then I found out that the guy we roughed up...

1190
01:18:52,290 --> 01:18:55,650
是FBI打字員
turned out to have a sister working as a typist for the FBI.

1191
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:58,590
誰會想到天下有那麼巧的事
Who could believe it? Of all the fucking people.

1192
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:02,060
她把吉米  我  甚至她弟弟全都抖出來了
She gave up everybody: Jimmy, me, even her brother.

1193
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:06,300
陪審團花了六小時  裁決我們有罪
It took the jury six hours to bring us in guilty.

1194
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:09,730
法官判我和吉米每人十年  好像在發糖果一樣
The judge gave Jimmy and me 10 years like he was giving away candy.

1195
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:12,570
判處你們在國立監獄服刑十年
...ten years in a federal penitentiary.

1196
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:16,870
現在交給檢察官
You will now be turned over to the U.S. Attorney General's office.

1197
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,810
來敬你一杯
Toast, guys.

1198
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:25,250
一路平安  祝福你們早日出來
Good trip, good life, get out soon.

1199
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:27,280
一切順利
Good trip, sweetheart.

1200
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:32,320
我們會替你照顧家的
We'll watch the home front.

1201
01:19:33,790 --> 01:19:36,290
替我問候那些口交的警衛
Say hello to those blow-job hacks.

1202
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:40,490
別忘了一有機會就佔他們的便宜
Yeah, motherfuck them every chance you get.

1203
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:48,870
有機會我會打電話給你
I'll call you when I get a chance.

1204
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:02,550
送我去監獄吧
Now take me to jail.

1205
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:10,030
在監獄裏  晚餐很重要
In prison, dinner was always a big thing.

1206
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:13,890
先來一道意大利面  接著或魚或肉
We had a pasta course, and then we had a meat or a fish.

1207
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:17,400
保利因藐視法庭被判了一年  他負責準備工作
Paulie did the prep work. He was doing a year for contempt...

1208
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:19,900
他有一套切大蒜的訣竅
and had this wonderful system for doing the garlic.

1209
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:23,100
用刀片切得很薄
He used a razor, and he used to slice it so thin...

1210
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,040
放在鍋裏  加上一點油就化了
that it used to liquefy in the pan with just a little oil.

1211
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:28,200
那方法很好
It was a very good system.

1212
01:20:28,450 --> 01:20:30,940
韋力掌管蕃茄汁
Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce.

1213
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,520
聞到了沒有
Get the smell?

1214
01:20:32,690 --> 01:20:35,420
這肉丸裏有三種肉
Three kinds of meat in the meatballs:

1215
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:37,610
有小牛肉  牛肉和豬肉
Veal, beef, and pork.

1216
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:40,080
那好  反正豬肉是一定要的
Good, but you gotta have the pork.

1217
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:41,780
那是主要的味道來源
That's the flavor.

1218
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:45,420
我覺得他洋蔥放多了  但味道還是很好
I felt he used too many onions, but it was still a very good sauce.

1219
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,360
韋力  不要放太多洋蔥
Vinnie, don't put too many onions in the sauce.

1220
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:51,130
我沒放太多
I didn't put too much onions in, Paul.

1221
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,200
只放了三個小的而已
Put three small onions, that's all I did.

1222
01:20:53,370 --> 01:20:55,930
三個洋蔥  那你放了幾罐蕃茄醬
Three onions? How many cans of tomatoes you put in there?

1223
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:58,840
- 兩大罐  - 你不需要放三個洋蔥
- I put two big cans. - You don't need three onions.

1224
01:20:59,010 --> 01:21:01,000
強尼煎牛排
Johnny Dio did the meat.

1225
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:03,780
因為沒有烤箱  強尼用平底鍋做菜
We had no broiler, so Johnny did everything in pans.

1226
01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:06,040
他每次都把屋子裏弄得烏煙瘴氣
It used to smell up the joint something awful...

1227
01:21:06,220 --> 01:21:09,190
警衛都被熏死了  但他的牛排還真是不錯
and the hacks used to die, but he still cooked a great steak.

1228
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,880
- 你的牛排要怎麼樣  - 半生的
- How do you like yours? - Medium rare.

1229
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:14,620
半生  貴族一個
Medium rare. An aristocrat.

1230
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:18,790
當你想到監獄  腦中就會出現像電影中那樣
You know, when you think of prison you get pictures in your mind...

1231
01:21:18,970 --> 01:21:22,600
一排排的人被關在鐵欄杆後面
of all those old movies with rows of guys behind bars.

1232
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:24,670
對兄弟來說不是那樣的
It wasn't like that for wiseguys.

1233
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:27,500
並不是那麼槽  除了我很想念吉米
It really wasn't that bad, excepting that I missed Jimmy...

1234
01:21:27,670 --> 01:21:29,070
他在亞特蘭大受刑
who was doing his time in Atlanta.

1235
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,680
順便給我兩塊牛排  好不好
Give me two steaks while you're in there, all right?

1236
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:37,550
在裏面的人都是嚴格地在受刑  混在一起像豬一樣
Everyone else in the joint was doing real time, mixed together, living like pigs.

1237
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:40,710
可是我們單獨生活  一切都由我們控制
But we lived alone. We owned the joint.

1238
01:21:40,890 --> 01:21:44,290
用球棒把那兩個狗娘養的臉打爛了  認都認不出來
We batted them sons of bitches. You couldn't recognize them.

1239
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:45,790
太好了  活該
Good, they deserved it.

1240
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:49,450
雖然有些警衛不受賄  但他們也不會告發我們
Even the hacks we couldn't bribe would never rat on the guys we did.

1241
01:21:49,630 --> 01:21:51,390
這樣才對  朋友鄰居間應該互相尊重
...had respect. People loved one another.

1242
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:52,590
夜不閉戶
They left their doors open.

1243
01:21:52,770 --> 01:21:53,760
抱歉  久等了
Sorry it took so long.

1244
01:21:53,930 --> 01:21:56,430
那個瘦子警衛越來越令人討厭了
The skinny guard's getting to be a real pain in the ass.

1245
01:21:56,570 --> 01:21:59,800
- 是該給那個雜種一點教訓了  - 我已經擺平了
- We're gonna have to do something. - I took care of him.

1246
01:21:59,970 --> 01:22:01,670
你帶了些什麼來
What'd you bring?

1247
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,330
- 麵包  - 好
- Bread. - Good.

1248
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:05,910
- 才烤出來的  - 韋力  你的辣椒和洋蔥有了
- Fresh. - Vinnie, I got your peppers and onions.

1249
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,380
香腸  火腿  還有很多奶酪
Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese.

1250
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:10,040
還有呢  還有什麼別的
Come on, what else?

1251
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:11,710
- 威士忌  - 好
- Scotch. - Nice.

1252

01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:16,750
- 我們可以吃了  - 我也拿了白葡萄酒
- Now we can eat. - I got some white, too.

1254
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,690
白葡萄酒也給我  太美了
Give me the white, too. Beautiful.

1255
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:21,850
來吧  夥計們  我們可以吃了  已經好了  韋力
Okay, boys, let's eat. Come on, it's ready, Vinnie.

1256
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:23,520
這裏還有些麵包
Some more bread.

1257
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:26,360
明天我們吃三明治  你該節食了  韋力
Tomorrow we eat sandwiches. You got to go on a diet, Vinnie.

1258
01:22:26,530 --> 01:22:28,590
- 你別開玩笑了  - 你最好聽我的
- You must be kidding. - Believe me.

1259
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,510
你在忙什麼
What are you doing?

1260
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:46,480
我也來一點
I'll take that.

1261
01:22:48,890 --> 01:22:51,380
- 好  晚一點見  - 對
- All right, I'll catch you guys later. - Yeah.

1262
01:22:51,530 --> 01:22:53,820
去公園散散步  是不是
You going for a walk in the park?

1263
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,490
- 好  下禮拜見  謝謝  - 好
- Okay, I'll catch you next week. Thanks. - Okay.

1264
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:03,900
- 還有沒有  - 沒了  全光了  週末愉快
- Is there any more? - No, that's it. Have a good weekend.

1265
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:05,060
- 謝啦  - 亨利  再見了
- Thanks. - You too, Henry.

1266
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:19,080
來
Come on.

1267
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:21,680
好好站在這兒
You girls stay right here.

1268
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:25,350
- 你們兩個牽著手  - 好了  一直走到前面去
- I want you to hold hands. - Okay, go right up to the front.

1269
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:27,590
- 走吧  - 你好嗎
- Let's go. - How you doing?

1270
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,200
- 還行  你呢  - 很好  謝謝你
- Good, how are you? - Very well, thank you.

1271
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:44,800
- 你講什麼呀  - 我在登記簿上看到她的名字了
- What you talking about? - I saw her name in the register.

1272
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:47,040
- 老天呀  - 你要她來看你嗎
- Jesus Christ. - You want her to visit you?

1273
01:23:47,210 --> 01:23:51,010
讓她為你哭整晚不睡  還寫信給假釋管理局
Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.

1274
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:54,150
你以為我在這兒做什麼  我在坐牢呀
What am I doing here? Where am I? I'm in jail.

1275
01:23:54,390 --> 01:23:56,580
我不能阻止別人來看我呀
I can't stop people from coming to see me.

1276
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:00,020
好呀  讓她每星期替你偷運這些東西進來
Good, let her sneak this stuff in for you every week.

1277
01:24:00,190 --> 01:24:04,820
- 讓她每星期來和那些雜種警衛打交道  - 你這是幹什麼
- Let her fight these bastards every week! - Look what you're doing! Stop it!

1278
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:07,530
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1279
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:10,530
讓她來替你把這些狗屎運進來
Let her sneak this shit in for you.

1280
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:13,400
你夠了沒有  凱倫
Will you stop it, Karen?

1281
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,400
- 讓她去做所有的事嘛  - 夠了
- Let her do it! - Stop it!

1282
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:27,950
我好孤獨  沒有人要幫我
Nobody's helping me. I'm all alone.

1283
01:24:28,890 --> 01:24:30,910
貝兒和摩裏都破產了
Belle and Morrie are broke.

1284
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:34,520
我向你的朋友利摩討他欠你的錢
I asked your friend Remo for the money that he owes you.

1285
01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:36,060
你知道他說什麼嗎
You know what he told me?

1286
01:24:36,230 --> 01:24:39,820
他叫我把孩子們帶到警察局去領救濟金
He told me to take my kids down to the police station and get on welfare.

1287
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,970
一切會過去的
It's gonna be okay.

1288
01:24:42,170 --> 01:24:46,270
就連保利  他出去後我也沒見到他  我都沒見到他們了
Even Paulie, since he got out, I've never seen him. I never see anybody anymore.

1289
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:49,200
只有我們兩個了
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away.

1290
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:53,370
我告訴過你  一旦進了牢就孤立了  忘掉所有的人  忘掉保利
I told you that we're on our own. Forget everybody else. Forget Paulie.

1291
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:58,370
他在保釋期間是不會幫任何人做任何事的
As long as he's on parole, he doesn't want anybody doing anything.

1292
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:03,190
- 我受不了了  - 你能夠忍受  聽我說
- I can't do it. - Yes, you can. Listen to me.

1293
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,850
你只要不斷把東西帶來
All I need is for you is to keep bringing me the stuff.

1294
01:25:06,030 --> 01:25:08,620
這裏有個從匹茲堡來的  他會幫我銷貨
I got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll help me move it.

1295
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,520
一個月後我們就安定了
In a month we're gonna be fine.

1296
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:13,050
- 我們不需要別人  - 我害怕
- We won't need anybody. - I'm afraid.

1297
01:25:13,170 --> 01:25:15,100
我怕萬一保利知道你私下在販毒
I'm afraid if Paulie finds out...

1298
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:16,720
我不是說了嗎  不要擔心保利
Don't worry about him.

1299
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:20,770
他並沒有幫我們呀  他有沒有供應食物給我們
He is not helping us out. Is he putting any food on the table?

1300
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:22,930
我們只有彼此幫助
We've gotta help each other.

1301
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:26,740
我們的行動一定要特別特別小心
We've just gotta be really careful while we do it.

1302
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:33,910
別讓我再聽到她的名字
I don't want to hear a word about her anymore.

1303
01:25:34,090 --> 01:25:35,110
永遠不會了
Never.

1304
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:40,720
四年後

1305
01:26:00,210 --> 01:26:01,870
爸爸
Daddy!

1306
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:05,750
- 我們好想念你  - 你會待下來嗎
- We missed you. - Are you here to stay?

1307
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:09,450
你看到我們的畫沒有  那張房子和彩虹是我畫的
Did you see our pictures? I did the one with the house and rainbow.

1308
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:11,110
太陽是我畫的
I did the sun.

1309
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:15,160
我的合唱團兩星期後有音樂會  你能來嗎
My chorus concert is in two weeks. Are you coming?

1310
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,860
喜歡我們的房子嗎
Do you like the house?

1311
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:21,160
凱倫  收拾行李  我們要搬家了
Karen, get packed. We're moving out of here.

1312
01:26:21,330 --> 01:26:22,390
怎麼搬
With what?

1313
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:25,700
不用擔心  去找新房子就好了
Don't worry, with what. Just start looking for a new house.

1314
01:26:25,870 --> 01:26:29,270
明早我要去匹茲堡  那邊有幾個人欠我一萬五千元
I got to go to Pittsburgh in the morning. Those guys there owe me $15,000.

1315
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,380
我們沒事了  我都安排好了
We'll be all right. I got things lined up.

1316
01:26:31,540 --> 01:26:34,210
匹茲堡  你明天要去向你的假釋官報到呀
Pittsburgh? You have to go see your parole officer tomorrow.

1317
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:37,280
凱倫  不要操心了  一切都會沒問題的
Don't worry about it. Everything's gonna be fine.

1318
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:40,350
- 誰要去保利伯伯家  - 我
- Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's? - Me!

1319
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:52,260
你要什麼
What do you want?

1320
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,520
甜心  讓媽媽好好吃飯
Sweetheart, let Mommy eat.

1321
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,870
氣色不錯  牢裏有吃得這麼好嗎
You look good. Did you eat this good in the joint?

1322
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:04,870
不要再搞那些勾當了
I don't want any more of that shit.

1323
01:27:05,050 --> 01:27:06,030
什麼勾當
What shit?

1324
01:27:06,210 --> 01:27:08,810
- 離那些垃圾遠一點  - 保利
- Just stay away from the garbage. - Look, Paulie...

1325
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:12,180
你在裏面做了我不管  你是身不由己
I'm not talking about what you did inside. You did what you had to do.

1326
01:27:12,350 --> 01:27:14,910
我指現在  從現在  從這裏開始
I'm talking about now. From now. Here and now.

1327
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:18,690
- 我怎麼會搞那些  - 不要把我當傻瓜
- Why would I get into that? - Don't make a jerk out of me.

1328
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:20,420
千萬不要
Just don't do it.

1329
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:27,130
現在  我要跟你談吉米  你要注意他
I want to talk to you about Jimmy. You gotta watch out for him.

1330
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:30,030
他很能賺錢  但他太狂了  太冒險了
He's a good earner, but he's wild, takes too many chances.

1331
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,690
我瞭解吉米  你想我會像他那樣冒險嗎
I know Jimmy. You think I would take chances like him?

1332
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,600
湯米也是個好孩子  但他太瘋了
Tommy's a good kid, but he's crazy.

1333
01:27:34,770 --> 01:27:36,500
他是個牛仔  他樣樣都想表現
He's a cowboy. He's got too much to prove.

1334
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,300
你不能不自己小心
You gotta watch out for kids like this.

1335
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:41,070
我太清楚他們的個性了  我只利用他們做些事
I know what they are. I only use them for certain things.

1336
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:43,770
我不要像蓋比那樣被人糟蹋  你明白嗎
I ain't gonna get fucked like Gribbs, you understand?

1337
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:48,280
蓋比已經70歲了  他將老死獄中  那不是我所要的
Gribbs is 70 years old. The fucking guy's gonna die in prison. I don't need that.

1338
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:52,490
所以我現在警告每一個人  連我兒子在內
So I'm warning everybody. Everybody. Could be my son, could be anybody.

1339
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:55,550
就因為蓋比手下的人
Gribbs got 20 years just for saying hello to some fuck...

1340
01:27:55,730 --> 01:27:57,820
在他背後販毒  他被判20年
who was sneaking behind his back, selling junk.

1341
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,430
我絕不容許這種事發生在我身上  你懂了嗎
I don't need that. That won't happen to me, understand?

1342
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:02,730
你能提早出來  是因為我給你找了份工作
You know you're out early because I got you a job.

1343
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:04,890
我不要整天被條子監視  明白嗎
I don't need this heat, you understand that?

1344
01:28:05,070 --> 01:28:08,970
如果你看到任何人在販毒  你一定要來告訴我
You see anybody fucking around with this shit you're gonna tell me, right?

1345
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:10,170
不管是誰
That means anybody.

1346
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:11,330
對不對
All right.

1347
01:28:11,510 --> 01:28:13,070
對  當然
Yeah. Of course.

1348
01:28:20,690 --> 01:28:24,620
我花了一個星期明查暗訪  才把那批匹茲堡貨賣掉
Took me about a week of sneaking around before I could unload the Pittsburgh stuff.

1349
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:27,280
不過我著實賺了一大筆
But when I did, it was a real score.

1350
01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:29,950
我開始利用珊蒂的家來混合毒品
I started using Sandy's place to mix the stuff.

1351
01:28:30,130 --> 01:28:32,560
雖然她吸的比她配的還多
And even with Sandy snorting more than she mixed...

1352
01:28:32,730 --> 01:28:35,360
但還是利潤極大的生意
I could see that this was a really good business.

1353
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:37,940
第二個禮拜我就賺了一萬兩千元
I made $12,000 in my second week.

1354
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:41,600
為我的房子付了頭期款  事情越來越順利了
I had a down payment on my house and things were really rolling.

1355
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:46,010
我只要偶爾告訴珊蒂我愛她就好了
All I had to do was every once in a while tell Sandy that I loved her.

1356
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:51,680
這種安排太完美了
But it was perfect, I'm telling you.

1357
01:28:51,850 --> 01:28:54,220
只要貨是從匹茲堡來的
As long as I kept getting the stuff from Pittsburgh...

1358
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:56,080
保利絕不可能發覺
I knew Paulie would never find out.

1359
01:28:56,260 --> 01:29:00,160
幾個禮拜之後生意做大了  我一個人處理不了
Within a couple of weeks, it got so big I needed some help.

1360
01:29:00,490 --> 01:29:03,290
就把吉米和湯米拉了進來
So I got Jimmy and Tommy to come in with me.

1361
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:05,220
真夠棒的
It's fucking great.

1362
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:06,630
康威先生
Mr. Conway.

1363
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:14,300
- 你薪水單帶來沒有  - 有
- Bring your pay slips? - Yeah.

1364
01:29:14,470 --> 01:29:17,170
保釋部

1365
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:19,900
興建工程花了四個半月
Four and a half months of dirt.

1366
01:29:20,950 --> 01:29:22,920
- 真好呀  - 撐過來了
- It's so good. - I did it.

1367
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,680
- 你喜歡嗎  - 真是太棒了
- Do you love it? - It's wonderful.

1368
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:30,890
這個訂做的  你坐坐看  貝兒
And this we just had to have made special. Go ahead, sit in it, Belle.

1369
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:33,580
有的坐下去真不舒服
The others you couldn't even sit in.

1370
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:35,280
好了  準備好
Okay, you ready?

1371
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:37,620
看著石壁
Watch the wall with the rock.

1372
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:48,070
電工特別設計的
The electricians did it special. Come on.

1373
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:51,010
來呀  來這邊
Come on. All right.

1374
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:54,770
這是進口貨  兩件組合起來的
This was imported. It came in two pieces. Do you believe what they can do?

1375
01:29:54,950 --> 01:29:56,280
不錯
It's nice, huh?

1376
01:29:56,450 --> 01:29:58,470
亨利  到這邊來  你跟吉米商量過了沒有
Henry, come over here. Did you and Jimmy talk?

1377
01:29:58,650 --> 01:30:01,140
我跟他說過了  他會仔細研究這件事的
I talked to him, and he's looking into everything.

1378
01:30:01,290 --> 01:30:04,480
這會讓上次法國航空的劫案看起來像兒童故事
This'll make the Air France haul look like goddamn peanuts.

1379
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:06,920
- 小聲點  - 你確定他會下手  對嗎
- Come on. - He's gonna do it, right?

1380
01:30:07,090 --> 01:30:09,190
我不是說了嗎  他要好好研究一下
I told you. He'll check everything out.

1381
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:11,770
然後再做決定  沒有任何承諾
He's looking into it. We'll see what happens. No promises.

1382
01:30:11,770 --> 01:30:16,130
我知道  你知道嗎  那兒有好幾百萬
I know. Do you understand? There's millions in there. And I've been...

1383
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:19,860
我想對這批貨下手想得都快吐血了  我栽培這個傢伙兩年了
bleeding for this caper, been cultivating this son of a bitch for two years.

1384
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:23,070
這傢伙欠我兩萬塊  一輩子就一次  我可以退休了
He owes me $20,000. Once in a lifetime. I could retire.

1385
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:27,480
不用再為錢操心  我的好夢就要成真了
No more nut every week. No more bullshit. My dream comes true.

1386
01:30:27,650 --> 01:30:29,310
來吧  我們來喝一杯吧
Morrie, let's get a drink.

1387
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:32,780
這就是吉米召集在一起
These are the guys that Jimmy put together for what turned out to be...

1388
01:30:32,950 --> 01:30:36,820
犯下美國歷史上最大劫案 德航劫案 的一批人
the biggest heist in American history: The Lufthansa heist.

1389
01:30:38,090 --> 01:30:40,790
湯米跟卡本負責抓住門口警衛
Tommy and Carbone were gonna grab the outside guard...

1390
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:43,450
逼他開大門
and make him get us in the front door.

1391
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:48,000
法國仔和周佛負責把工作人員集中在一起
Frenchy and Joe Buddha had to round up the workers.

1392
01:30:48,570 --> 01:30:52,700
強尼負責把貨綁起來  以免觸到警鈴
Johnny Roastbeef had to keep them all tied up and away from the alarms.

1393
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:55,530
就連史達克也被拉進來了
Even Stacks Edwards got in on it.

1394
01:30:55,710 --> 01:30:59,240
他常彈吉他  大家都喜歡他
He used to hang around the lounge and play guitar. Everybody loved Stacks.

1395
01:30:59,410 --> 01:31:01,850
他的任務是偷輛大卡車
What he was supposed to do was steal the panel truck...

1396
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:05,140
事後由紐澤西州朋友處理掉
and afterwards compact it by a friend of ours out in Jersey.

1397
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,680
只有摩裏真的煩死人了
Only Morrie was driving us nuts.

1398
01:31:07,850 --> 01:31:09,850
摩裏  喝一杯酒  然後閉嘴
Morrie, have a drink and shut up.

1399
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:13,080
因為這次的劫案是他從中拉線的
Just because he set this up, he felt he could bust Jimmy's balls...

1400
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:15,780
摩裏就以為他可以向吉米預支是理所當然的事
for an advance on the money we were going to steal.

1401
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:19,560
他並沒有什麼其他的意思  他就是這樣的人
He didn't mean anything by it. That's just the way he was.

1402
01:31:26,410 --> 01:31:30,540
我讓每個人都替我做事  就連以前的嬰兒保姆也在內
I had everybody working for me. Even our old baby-sitter, Lois Byrd.

1403
01:31:33,550 --> 01:31:35,040
飛機還穩吧
Did you have a good flight?

1404
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:37,710
我恨匹茲堡  你在哪裏找到那些爛人的
I hate Pittsburgh. Where did you find such creeps?

1405
01:31:37,850 --> 01:31:39,820
好啦  沒那麼糟啦
Come on, they're not that bad.

1406
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:43,050
跑這一趟是值得的  對嗎
And it's worth it, isn't it?

1407
01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:45,590
你上禮拜用的是不是這個嬰兒
Is this the same baby you used last week?

1408
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:48,820
不  上次是我姐姐的嬰兒  這次是狄娜的
No, that one was my sister's. This is Deirdra's.

1409
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:50,960
打哈欠了
Big yawn.

1410
01:31:51,130 --> 01:31:52,860
她長得好像你呀
She looks just like you.

1411
01:31:53,530 --> 01:31:55,870
空中小姐也這麼說
That's what the stewardess said.

1412
01:32:08,650 --> 01:32:10,450
別那麼狠好不好  珊蒂
Take it easy, Sandy.

1413
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:13,350
饒了我吧  我們這裏有的是呀
Come on, give me a break. You got enough here to go around.

1414
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:16,850
少吸一點  你還有一整天  一次太多就不夠用了
You got all day. Just make it last, all right? Take it easy.

1415
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:19,120
- 我得走了  - 你去哪裏
- I got to go. - Where are you going?

1416
01:32:19,290 --> 01:32:23,390
不要跟我爭  你知道我要去辦事  操  我的車鑰匙呢
Don't start. You know I gotta go do this thing. Fuck, where are my keys?

1417
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:26,060
就在那裏
Over there.

1418
01:32:26,230 --> 01:32:27,930
真夠亂的  像豬窩一樣
It's a mess. It's like a pig pen.

1419
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:30,130
洗碗機買來是做什麼的
What do you think I got you the dishwasher for?

1420
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:32,100
我討厭洗碗  弄壞我指甲
I hate doing the dishes. Fucks up my nails.

1421
01:32:32,270 --> 01:32:34,000
我不管你討不討厭洗碗  你要放聰明點
How could you hate it? You got to be smart.

1422
01:32:34,170 --> 01:32:37,300
就憑這些白粉  被抓到了我們就別想出來了
Look at all this powder around here. That could put us away forever.

1423
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:39,710
- 別這麼緊張嘛  - 你想幹什麼
- Loosen up. - What are you doing?

1424
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:44,350
- 我得走了  - 你哪兒也不用去
- You know, I gotta... - You don't have to go anywhere.

1425
01:32:45,450 --> 01:32:46,980
讓他們等
Make them wait.

1426
01:32:56,330 --> 01:32:59,890
今晨黎明前  肯尼迪機場的德國航空貨運站被劫
Nobody knows for sure just how much was taken in the daring pre-dawn raid...

1427
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:02,660
沒人能確定被劫的數目
at the Lufthansa cargo terminal at Kennedy Airport.

1428
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:06,570
FBI說是兩百萬  航空警察說四百萬
The FBI says $2 million, Port Authority Police say $4 million...

1429
01:33:09,910 --> 01:33:11,970
吉米
Jimmy!

1430
01:33:12,150 --> 01:33:13,980
你們這些狗娘養的
Those sons of bitches!

1431
01:33:14,150 --> 01:33:16,480
在肯尼迪機場被劫的現場轉播
...from the scene of the heist at JFK.

1432
01:33:16,650 --> 01:33:20,280
看起來也許是本市歷年來最大的一宗劫案
It looks like a big one. Maybe the biggest this town has ever seen.

1433
01:33:22,190 --> 01:33:24,350
過來  過來
Come here, you! Come here!

1434
01:33:25,430 --> 01:33:28,120
看看這個天才  這是個天才
Look at this genius. This genius!

1435
01:33:32,570 --> 01:33:34,500
聖誕快樂
Merry Christmas.

1436
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:41,710
- 哈羅  這是誰呀  - 這是我太太
- Hello, who's this? - That's my wife.

1437
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:45,640
你過來  給你看一樣東西
Come here. I want to show you something, Jimmy.

1438
01:33:48,350 --> 01:33:49,710
它美吧
Isn't she gorgeous?

1439
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:53,080
我買給我老婆的  是兩門的  我愛死它了
I bought it for my wife. It's a coupe. I love that car.

1440
01:33:55,890 --> 01:33:58,760
我怎麼跟你說的  我確實跟你說過的
What did I tell you? I talked to you before, didn't I?

1441
01:33:58,930 --> 01:34:00,220
你不瞭解情況嗎
Didn't I say what was going on?

1442
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:02,490
我沒告訴你暫時不要買東西嗎
Didn't I say not to go buy anything for a while?

1443
01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:05,650
- 竟然買輛新車  - 是我媽送的
- The fucking car? - It's a wedding gift from my mother.

1444
01:34:05,830 --> 01:34:07,960
車主也是她  我才剛結婚呀
It's under her name. I just got married.

1445
01:34:08,130 --> 01:34:10,930
- 我好愛那輛車  - 對不起  你等一下
- I love that car. - Excuse me, darling, for just a second.

1446
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:13,370
- 我剛結婚耶  - 你是不是瘋了
- I just got married. - Are you nuts?

1447
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:16,340
- 你這麼激動幹什麼  - 你是笨豬呀
- What are you getting excited for? - Are you stupid?

1448
01:34:16,510 --> 01:34:19,070
外面有成千上萬警察在注意我們
We got a million bulls out there. Everybody's watching us.

1449
01:34:19,250 --> 01:34:21,010
你居然弄了輛新車  還說我激動
And you get a fucking car. I'm excited?

1450
01:34:21,180 --> 01:34:23,050
那是我用我媽名字登記的  那是結婚禮物嘛
It's under my mother's name. It's a wedding gift.

1451
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:25,580
我不管是登記誰的名字  你是真笨還是假笨呀
I don't give a fuck. Are you stupid?

1452
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:27,740
你沒聽見我說的嗎  什麼都不要買
Didn't you hear what I said? Don't buy anything.

1453
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:31,550
特別是大東西  你沒聽見我這麼說的嗎
Don't get anything. Nothing big. What's the matter with you?

1454
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:33,060
你到底是怎麼搞的
What are you getting excited for?

1455
01:34:33,230 --> 01:34:36,590
因為你會連累我們被捕  你白癡啊
Because you're going to get us all fucking pinched. What are you, stupid?

1456
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:39,490
- 你是怎麼搞的  - 對不起
- What's the matter with you? - I apologize.

1457
01:34:40,970 --> 01:34:44,160
- 我道歉  - 你是怎麼搞的
- I'm sorry. - What the fuck is the matter with you?

1458
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:47,800
對不起
I'm sorry.

1459
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:53,940
對不起  吉米  在我媽名下
I'm sorry, Jimmy. It's under my mother's name.

1460
01:34:54,610 --> 01:34:57,310
說什麼  你在跟我爭辯嗎
What'd you say? You being a fucking wise guy with me?

1461
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:00,380
- 我錯了  我道歉  - 我是怎麼告訴你的
- I'm sorry. I apologize. - What did I tell you?

1462
01:35:00,790 --> 01:35:03,780
聽見沒有  什麼也不許買
What did I tell you? You don't buy anything, you hear me?

1463
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:05,580
什麼也不許買
Don't buy anything!

1464
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,350
對不起  吉米
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1465
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:13,030
那個死胖子  他該掛一個笨蛋的牌子
The fat fuck, he ought to wear a sign.

1466
01:35:20,470 --> 01:35:22,840
我真不敢相信有這種事  你是變笨了是不是
I can't believe this. Are you stupid or what?

1467
01:35:23,010 --> 01:35:24,310
抱歉
Excuse me.

1468
01:35:24,580 --> 01:35:26,160
- 你在做什麼  - 脫下來
- What's the matter? - Take it off.

1469
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:29,640
- 你在搞什麼名堂  - 脫下來
- Why? What's the matter? - Take it off!

1470
01:35:31,550 --> 01:35:35,080
難道我沒告訴你不要買名貴的東西  不要引人注意嗎
Didn't I tell you not to get anything big and not to attract attention?

1471
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:38,310
兩天之內  一個買凱迪拉克  一個買貂皮大衣
In two days, one guy gets a Caddy and one gets a $20,000 mink.

1472
01:35:38,490 --> 01:35:40,390
- 退回去  - 我會退回去
- Bring it fucking back. - I'll bring it back.

1473
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:44,050
不管怎樣  把東西退回去
I don't care what you do. Bring it where you got it before.

1474
01:35:44,230 --> 01:35:46,960
- 把它拿出去  - 好  我聽見了  快點走吧
- Get it out of here! - All right. Let's go, honey.

1475
01:35:56,380 --> 01:35:58,940
這種酒比性愛還爽
This drink here is better than sex, babe.

1476
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:05,210
我要去找史達克  不要東張西望  否則宰了你
I'm gonna go see Stacks. Don't you look at anybody or I'll fucking kill you.

1477
01:36:05,490 --> 01:36:09,320
他醋勁好大  我不能看別人一眼  他會殺了我
He's so jealous. If I even look at anyone else, he'll kill me.

1478
01:36:09,660 --> 01:36:11,090
不錯喔
That's great.

1479
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:14,350
我告訴他們不要引人注意
Tell them all to relax. Don't attract attention.

1480
01:36:17,430 --> 01:36:19,300
我一直在找你們
I've been looking all over for you.

1481
01:36:19,470 --> 01:36:21,260
聖誕快樂
How are you? Merry Christmas.

1482
01:36:21,430 --> 01:36:23,460
我需要錢
Listen, I need the money.

1483
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:27,090
- 輕鬆點  摩裏  好嗎  - 吉米  我需要錢呀
- Morrie, relax, okay? It's Christmas. - Jimmy, I need the money.

1484
01:36:27,270 --> 01:36:29,540
我是很輕鬆  但我需要錢
I'm relaxing. I need the money.

1485
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:32,900
- 該做的都做了  我要錢  - 今晚不行  摩裏
- I did what I had to do. I need the money. - Not tonight, Morrie.

1486
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:35,020
你聽著  我給你們計劃得好好的  他欠我那份
Listen, I did my caper. He owes me.

1487
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:36,710
大家都在炫耀新東西
Everybody's flashing their stuff.

1488
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:39,880
顯然他們都拿到錢了  我還在穿舊衣裳
Evidently, they got their money. I'm wearing the same shit.

1489
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:43,320
- 今晚不行  - 他們都穿在身上  我一定要跟他談
- Just not tonight. - They're wearing it. I gotta talk to him.

1490
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:48,120
他應該給我50萬
I got $500,000 coming to me.

1491
01:36:48,290 --> 01:36:50,730
他一輩子也沒弄到過這麼多錢
The biggest fucking bundle he ever made in his life.

1492
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:53,530
摩裏  我會跟他說  你去喝杯酒
Morrie, I'll go talk to him. Go have a drink, all right?

1493
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:55,790
- 我去找他談  - 我看這是惡毒
- I'll talk to him. - It's poison in my eyes.

1494
01:36:55,970 --> 01:36:58,870
- 摩裏寶貝  你沒事吧  - 我沒事
- Morris, baby, are you all right? - No, I'm not.

1495
01:36:59,070 --> 01:36:59,660
吉米
Jimmy

1496
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:08,420
聖誕快樂  你的一份  先嘗嘗味道
Christmas. Your share. Just a little taste.

1497
01:37:11,630 --> 01:37:12,960
我們做到了
We did it!

1498
01:37:15,670 --> 01:37:17,360
- 吉米  - 是
- Jimmy. - Yeah.

1499
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,940
- 誰呀  - 是我
- Yeah, who is it? - It's me.

1500
01:37:20,110 --> 01:37:21,700
彼特  等一下
Pete? One second.

1501
01:37:22,610 --> 01:37:25,870
不要學法蘭基和強尼  不要暴露
Don't do what Frankie and Johnny did. Don't be a moron with the money.

1502
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:27,640
- 明白嗎  - 當然
- Do what's right, you understand? - Yeah.

1503
01:37:28,350 --> 01:37:30,910
凱倫  茱迪  露絲  過來!
Karen, Judy, Ruth, come here!

1504
01:37:31,450 --> 01:37:34,180
我買了棵最貴的聖誕樹
I got the most expensive tree they had.

1505
01:37:35,620 --> 01:37:39,250
- 媽咪  你說哪一件好看  - 我每件都喜歡
- What do you think, Mommy? - I love them all.

1506
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:41,020
我喜歡金色那件
I love the gold outfit.

1507
01:37:41,190 --> 01:37:42,960
- 聖誕快樂  - 謝謝你
- Merry Christmas. - Thank you.

1508
01:37:43,130 --> 01:37:44,490
- 嗯  - 聖誕快樂
- What? - Merry Christmas.

1509
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:45,960
還有
And?

1510
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:47,890
快樂漠路卡節
Happy Hanukkah.

1511
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:52,030
- 好笑喔  - 買你喜歡的東西
- Very funny. - Go get yourself something nice, okay?

1512
01:38:00,350 --> 01:38:04,710
德航劫案價值六百萬  使我們一生不愁吃穿
Lufthansa should have been our ultimate score. The heist of a lifetime.

1513
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:08,550
每個人都得到一份可觀的數目  這樣其實就應該足夠了
$6 million in cash. More than enough to go around.

1514
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:19,980
史達克  開門呀
Yo, Stacks!

1515
01:38:20,350 --> 01:38:22,970
你在幹什麼呀
Open up! What's up? What're you doing?

1516
01:38:29,260 --> 01:38:33,160
你怎麼搞的  這傢伙還沒準備好
What's with you? He ain't ready. I knew you wouldn't be ready.

1517
01:38:33,330 --> 01:38:36,560
- 你沒帶咖啡來嗎  - 我又不是送外賣的
- You didn't bring any coffee? - What do I look like, a fucking caterer?

1518
01:38:36,730 --> 01:38:39,660
法蘭基  煮點咖啡吧  起來呀
Frankie will make coffee. Go ahead, Frankie, make coffee.

1519
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:44,830
我以為你會有個女人在
Thought you had one of your bitches in here.

1520
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,370
是有一個  到哪去了
Yeah, I did. Where the fuck is she?

1521
01:38:48,370 --> 01:38:51,370
總是少不了黃色書刊和女人
Always got these hot books around, or a bitch, or something.

1522
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:52,740
幾點了
What time is it?

1523
01:38:52,910 --> 01:38:56,870
- 11點半了  我們應該9點到的  - 馬上就好
- It's 11:30. We had to be there by 9:00. - I'll be ready in a minute.

1524
01:38:57,050 --> 01:39:00,920
你老是遲到  連你自己的葬禮也會遲到
You're always fucking late. You'd be late for your own fucking funeral.

1525
01:39:05,890 --> 01:39:09,830
有什麼好看的  把咖啡帶走吧
What the fuck you looking at? Make that coffee to go. Let's go.

1526
01:39:12,970 --> 01:39:14,870
我是開玩笑啦  操
What the fuck you doing? It's a joke.

1527
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:17,900
你還真要把咖啡帶走  放下來啦
Put the fucking pot down. You gonna take the coffee?

1528
01:39:37,690 --> 01:39:39,660
史達克總是瘋瘋癲癲的
Stacks was always crazy.

1529
01:39:39,990 --> 01:39:43,660
他沒有照計劃把卡車處理掉  反而吸大麻吸嗨了
Instead of getting rid of the truck as he was supposed to, he got stoned...

1530
01:39:43,830 --> 01:39:48,360
跑去女朋友家  當他醒來  警察已經找到了卡車
went to his girlfriend's, and by the time he woke up, the cops had found the truck.

1531
01:39:48,530 --> 01:39:50,630
電視上報告說
It was all over the television.

1532
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:53,800
已在車上找到指紋
They even said they came up with prints off the wheel.

1533
01:39:54,510 --> 01:39:57,970
不用多久  他們就會找到史達克的
It was just a matter of time before they got to Stacks.

1534
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:11,520
我必須和你談談
I gotta talk to you.

1535
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:14,350
- 來一杯吧  - 來呀  來一杯
- Have a drink. - Have a drink. Come on.

1536
01:40:14,860 --> 01:40:18,660
來一杯  好不容易聚在一起喝一杯
Have a drink. What you doing? It's an occasion. Have a drink.

1537
01:40:19,970 --> 01:40:22,030
我還是得跟你談談
I still gotta talk to you.

1538
01:40:22,370 --> 01:40:23,360
什麼事呀
What?

1539
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:26,330
- 史達克出了什麼事  - 不要擔心
- What happened with Stacks? - Don't worry about that.

1540
01:40:26,510 --> 01:40:30,270
- 到處都是FBI的人  - 那又怎樣  他們能找到什麼
- There's feds all over the place. - So what? Where are they gonna go?

1541
01:40:30,510 --> 01:40:33,030
- 報上登出來了  - 他很擔心
- It's in the papers. - He's worried.

1542
01:40:33,650 --> 01:40:34,670
你在擔心什麼
What are you worried about?

1543
01:40:34,850 --> 01:40:38,940
只是電視上  報上都有消息
The television and the newspapers. All the shit's out there.

1544
01:40:39,050 --> 01:40:42,280
- 你到底擔心什麼  - 你太多慮了
- What are you worried about? - You worry too much.

1545
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:45,210
一切美好  什麼都不用擔心
Everything is beautiful. There's nothing to worry about.

1546
01:40:45,390 --> 01:40:47,790
- 你告訴他了沒有  - 沒有  我還沒告訴他
- Didn't you tell him? - I didn't tell him yet.

1547
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:49,390
- 什麼事呀  - 猜猜看
- What? - Guess what?

1548
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,590
他們要正式讓湯米成為黑手黨一員
They're gonna make him.

1549
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:56,230
保利要引薦你嗎
Paulie's going to make you?

1550
01:40:57,140 --> 01:40:58,300
湯米
Tommy.

1551
01:40:58,470 --> 01:41:00,910
他們把名單打開了  保利得到批准把他正式加入名單
They opened up the books. Paulie got the okay.

1552
01:41:01,070 --> 01:41:03,770
你相信嗎  這個意大利雜種
You believe that? This little guinea bastard.

1553
01:41:04,710 --> 01:41:09,110
他要上正式名單了  這傢伙要成我們的上司了
He's gonna get made. We're gonna work for this guy one day. He's gonna be a boss.

1554
01:41:10,550 --> 01:41:12,110
我真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

1555
01:41:12,290 --> 01:41:14,380
我真為你高興  太好了  恭喜你
I'm really happy for you. Great. Congratulations.

1556
01:41:14,550 --> 01:41:16,520
我們現在佔上風了
Motherfuckers, we got them now.

1557
01:41:17,090 --> 01:41:21,360
吉米  我到處在找你  我能跟你說幾句話嗎
Jimmy, I've been looking all over for you. Can I talk to you a second?

1558
01:41:22,130 --> 01:41:24,460
我做的計劃  結果我什麼也沒得到
I mastermind the goddamn thing, I'm left with dick.

1559
01:41:24,630 --> 01:41:28,030
要不是我  他們就很辛苦  我要我的錢
They'd be up a creek if not for me. Fuck him! I want my money.

1560
01:41:28,370 --> 01:41:30,460
我受夠了  我要我的錢
I want my money! I've had it up to here!

1561
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:33,000
那個專門劫香煙的下流鬼
That cheap cigarette hijacker.

1562
01:41:33,410 --> 01:41:36,200
- 去他的  我要我的錢  - 去呀  去跟他講呀
- Fuck him! I want my money! - Good. Go tell him.

1563
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:41,480
你是不是還要嚷嚷
You're gonna keep your mouth shut, or what?

1564
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:44,980
你會拿到錢的
Morrie, you're gonna get your money.

1565
01:41:45,150 --> 01:41:47,640
但你不能老是這樣煩人家
You just got to stop busting balls.

1566
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:50,850
好  看著我  聽見了嗎  看著我
All right? Look at me. You hear me? Look at me, okay?

1567
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:53,250
一切不會有問題的
Everything's going to be fine.

1568
01:41:59,370 --> 01:42:00,390
亨利
Henry.

1569
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:09,470
好小子  半愛爾蘭  半意大利人是嗎  我拿意大利腔來唱
Sweetheart, half mick, half guinea? I'll sing with an Italian accent.

1570
01:42:51,850 --> 01:42:55,150
我頭一次看到吉米那麼緊張
I could see for the first time that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.

1571
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:58,480
他同時朝八個方向去想
His mind was going in eight different directions at once.

1572
01:43:00,790 --> 01:43:03,280
你想摩裏有沒有把什麼事都告訴他太太
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?

1573
01:43:03,530 --> 01:43:04,930
摩裏啊
Morrie? Him?

1574
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:08,370
那時候我就知道吉米要把摩裏幹掉
That's when I knew Jimmy was going to whack Morrie.

1575
01:43:08,530 --> 01:43:12,870
事情就是這樣  一個人在幾分鐘之內就被決定了要被幹掉
That's how it happens. That's how fast it takes for a guy to get whacked.

1576
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:15,940
你知道他就是那種大嘴巴
He's a nut job. He talks to everybody.

1577
01:43:16,110 --> 01:43:19,570
你看過他的電視廣告  像隻豬
Acts like a jerk in his commercials. Nobody listens to what he says.

1578
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:22,910
誰拿他的話當一回事  他整天說個不停
Nobody fucking cares what he says, he talks so much.

1579
01:43:23,150 --> 01:43:25,740
今天晚上把他帶來
Make sure you bring him here tonight.

1580
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:27,550
- 知道嗎  - 知道
- Okay? - All right.

1581
01:43:29,990 --> 01:43:32,860
就這樣開始  抱歉  我有沒有弄到你眼睛
Start like this. Sorry. Did I get you in the eye?

1582
01:43:33,030 --> 01:43:34,990
少惹我了好不好
Stop breaking my balls, all right?

1583
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:37,030
我只是在拖時間
I was just stalling for time.

1584
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:41,860
希望在9點以前能說服吉米
I knew I still had till 8:00 or 9:00 to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.

1585
01:43:42,070 --> 01:43:46,100
到現在為止  吉米還是認為我同意把摩裏幹掉
But meanwhile, as far as Jimmy knew, I was going along with the program.

1586
01:43:46,270 --> 01:43:50,040
我把他頭髮拔出來了  我咬了他  他昏迷了
I pulled his hair out of his fucking head. I bit him. He's out cold.

1587
01:43:52,140 --> 01:43:54,410
我氣死了  我要殺了他
I'm enraged. I wanted to kill this little fuck.

1588
01:43:54,580 --> 01:43:57,520
所以我先走開了  我們正要進去
I walk away. We start to go in the fucking joint.

1589
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:00,720
我不想轉身  吉米對我這樣
I don't want to turn around. Jimmy's going like this to me.

1590
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:03,420
我不想轉身
I don't want to fucking turn around.

1591
01:44:03,590 --> 01:44:07,750
我不想轉身  他媽的  他抬頭說
I don't want to turn around. He picks up his fucking head, he says...

1592
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:10,890
我說  不要講
I said, "Don't say it."

1593
01:44:15,230 --> 01:44:16,570
敗類
"Jerkoff!"

1594
01:44:19,310 --> 01:44:22,830
還能怎樣  我就向他撲過去
What are you going to do? What? I fucking fly at him.

1595
01:44:23,010 --> 01:44:25,980
我抓住他  開始捶他頭  臉
I got him and I'm banging his head, banging his fucking face.

1596
01:44:26,150 --> 01:44:27,870
拔他頭髮
I'm pulling his hair out of his head.

1597
01:44:28,050 --> 01:44:31,040
我把他打得稀巴爛
I beat him to a pulp. To a pulp I beat him.

1598
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:34,150
他躺著  渾身是血  我在喘氣
He's laying there full of fucking blood. I'm out of breath.

1599
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,910
今晚就算了  今晚算了
Forget about tonight. Forget about it.

1600
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:39,780
我心裏的負擔減輕了
It was a load off my mind.

1601
01:44:40,890 --> 01:44:42,160
那個傢伙
Poor bastard.

1602
01:44:42,330 --> 01:44:44,490
還不知道自己有多危險
He never knew how close he'd come to getting killed.

1603
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:47,600
就算我告訴他  他差點沒命  恐怕他也不會相信的
Even if I told him, he would have never believed me.

1604
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:53,290
- 吉米  現在我能跟你談談嗎  - 你這狗娘養的  你真夠煩人
- Jimmy, could I talk to you now? - You're a pisser. A real pisser.

1605
01:44:53,910 --> 01:44:57,140
你要現在談嗎  好吧  我們來做個了斷
Want to talk now? Okay, let's talk. Let's get it over with.

1606
01:44:57,310 --> 01:45:00,300
從來沒見過像你這麼難纏的人
I've never met a ball buster like you, my whole life.

1607
01:45:00,510 --> 01:45:02,480
誰比我還愛你
Who loves you more than I do?

1608
01:45:02,650 --> 01:45:05,980
- 我會為你做任何事  - 除了不肯少來煩我
- I'd do anything for you. - Except to stop busting my balls.

1609
01:45:06,890 --> 01:45:09,290
- 我們去喝咖啡吧  - 去餐廳還是別的地方
- Let's go have coffee. - Want to go to the diner?

1610
01:45:09,460 --> 01:45:11,720
我們去大道上的餐廳
We'll go to the diner on the boulevard.

1611
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:15,360
- 哪一間呢  - 洛克威大道  24小時營業
- Which diner? - Rockaway Boulevard. It's open 24 hours.

1612
01:45:15,530 --> 01:45:17,620
- 有沒有丹麥蛋糕  - 他們什麼都有
- They got Danishes? - They got everything.

1613
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:20,090
我要帶幾個回去給貝兒
Let's pick up some Danishes for Belle.

1614
01:45:20,730 --> 01:45:22,600
你有沒有聽到我們在波士頓安排籃球賽放水的事
Hear about the points we were shaving up in Boston?

1615
01:45:23,110 --> 01:45:24,900
那真是太棒了
It's terrific. Nunzio...

1616
01:45:33,150 --> 01:45:34,670
我以為他永遠也不會閉嘴
I thought he'd never shut up.

1617
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:36,540
沒人比他更令人討厭
What a pain in the ass.

1618
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:39,510
- 你要怎麼處理他  - 把他分屍  丟掉  把車也丟掉
- What'll we do with him? - Chop him up and get rid of the car.

1619
01:45:39,690 --> 01:45:41,620
然後打電話給我
Call me when you're through.

1620
01:45:41,790 --> 01:45:44,220
- 法蘭基  我們來把他大卸八塊吧  - 好吧
- Frank, let's chop him up. - All right.

1621
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:46,880
你要去哪裏  你昏頭啦
Where you going, you dizzy motherfucker, you?

1622
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:48,020
你不是說要把他解了嗎
You said chop him up.

1623
01:45:48,190 --> 01:45:51,630
不是在這裏  去查理那兒  在這裏怎麼切
At Charlie's, not here! Where are you gonna chop him here?

1624
01:45:52,630 --> 01:45:55,260
你在做什麼  快離開這裏
Come on, what are you doing? Get out of here.

1625
01:45:55,430 --> 01:45:57,730
還不如讓他開車
I got a better shot letting him drive.

1626
01:45:57,900 --> 01:45:59,430
車引擎是冷的
The car's cold.

1627
01:45:59,610 --> 01:46:03,170
熱什麼鬼車  快離開現場
Get the fuck out of here! What, warm it up? Get out of here!

1628
01:46:04,010 --> 01:46:06,500
- 是誰  - 是貝爾  開門
- Who is it? - It's Belle. Open up.

1629
01:46:06,650 --> 01:46:08,340
是貝爾  讓我進來
It's Belle. Let me in.

1630
01:46:09,220 --> 01:46:13,020
摩裏沒有回家  他失蹤了  我知道他一定出事了
Morris didn't come home. He's missing. I know something's happened.

1631
01:46:13,190 --> 01:46:14,520
冷靜一點
Calm down.

1632
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:17,250
他失蹤了  我知道出事了
He's missing! I know something happened.

1633
01:46:17,420 --> 01:46:19,620
他大概是喝醉了  倒在那裏睡著了
He's probably drunk and fell asleep somewhere.

1634
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:23,460
27年了  他從來沒有在外過夜  而不打電話給我的
In 27 years, he's never been away all night without calling.

1635
01:46:23,630 --> 01:46:26,390
肯定出事了  你們一定曉得
I know something's happened. I know you know.

1636
01:46:26,570 --> 01:46:30,190
我上樓去換衣服  先送你回家  然後去找他
Let me get changed. I'll take you home, then look for him.

1637
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:33,870
- 我是從家裏來的  我一直打電話  - 他在玩牌吧
- I've been home! I've been on the phone... - He's playing cards.

1638
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:39,570
- 你要我怎麼跟貝爾講  - 誰他媽在乎
- What'll I tell Belle? - Who gives a fuck?

1639
01:46:40,450 --> 01:46:43,880
就說他跟野女人私奔了  關你什麼事
Tell her he ran off with some broad. What do you care?

1640
01:46:44,050 --> 01:46:46,210
- 你看  - 不要跟他們作對
- Watch this. - Don't fuck with them.

1641
01:46:46,390 --> 01:46:48,410
就算坐一點牢  也總算搗了他們的蛋
I do it all the time. I'll bust their balls.

1642
01:46:48,590 --> 01:46:51,450
別給他們這個機會來得意了
Don't give them the satisfaction, the fucks.

1643
01:46:53,730 --> 01:46:56,060
走吧  我們去兜風
Come on, fuckos. Let's go for a ride.

1644
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:59,090
他們一夜沒睡了
Keep them up all night.

1645
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,590
待會兒見
I'll see you later.

1646
01:47:51,250 --> 01:47:54,410
吉米想把每一個能把他和劫案牽連在一起的人都除掉
Jimmy was cutting every link between himself and the robbery...

1647
01:47:54,590 --> 01:47:56,990
好在跟我一點關係都沒有
but it had nothing to do with me.

1648
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:10,800
我給吉米一些可劫對象的消息  他則給我錢
I gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me some Christmas money.

1649
01:48:12,570 --> 01:48:14,940
之後我沒再提大劫案的事
From then on, I kept my mouth shut.

1650
01:48:15,110 --> 01:48:18,980
我知道錢在吉米那裏
I knew Jimmy. He had the cash. It was his.

1651
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:22,480
他只拿一點錢孝敬保利而已
He kicked some money upstairs to Paulie, but that was it.

1652
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:27,040
要他把錢分給有功勞的人  那是不可能的事
It made him sick to turn the money over to the guys who stole it.

1653
01:48:27,220 --> 01:48:30,050
他寧願把他們殺了  反正關我什麼事
He'd rather whack them. Anyway, what did I care?

1654
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:32,050
我也不想向吉米要求什麼
I wasn't asking for anything.

1655
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:35,820
吉米倒從我的匹茲堡路線收穫不少
And Jimmy was making nice money through my Pittsburgh connections.

1656
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:40,460
大劫案之後幾個月  仍然到處發現死屍
Still, months after the robbery they were finding bodies all over.

1657
01:49:02,490 --> 01:49:05,220
當他們在冷凍車庫裏找到卡本的屍體
When they found Carbone in the meat truck...

1658
01:49:05,390 --> 01:49:07,020
他已經冷凍得
he was frozen so stiff...

1659
01:49:07,190 --> 01:49:10,320
要花兩天才能解凍  才能拿出來解剖
it took them two days to thaw him out for the autopsy.

1660
01:49:15,170 --> 01:49:17,290
我從沒見過吉米那麼高興
Still, I never saw Jimmy so happy.

1661
01:49:17,700 --> 01:49:21,300
他簡直像個孩子  匹茲堡給我們帶來錢財
He was like a kid. We had money coming in through my Pittsburgh people...

1662
01:49:21,470 --> 01:49:25,000
德航劫案的調查也漸漸冷卻下來
and even after a while, the Lufthansa thing began to calm down.

1663
01:49:25,180 --> 01:49:27,540
那天早上令吉米高興的原因
What made Jimmy so happy that morning...

1664
01:49:27,710 --> 01:49:30,610
是因為湯米要被引薦
was that this was the day that Tommy was being made.

1665
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:33,910
他興奮得好像他自己要被引薦似的
Jimmy was so excited, you'd think he was being made.

1666
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:37,150
他至少打了四次電話到湯米家
He must have made four calls to Tommy's house.

1667
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:41,290
引薦禮完成之後以信號表示
They had a signal set up, so he'd know the minute the ceremony was over.

1668
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:44,390
- 媽  你在哪兒  - 在這裏呀
- Ma, where are you? - Here I am.

1669
01:49:45,030 --> 01:49:47,590
- 你回來啦  - 回來  我正要出去呀
- You're home. - Home? I'm leaving.

1670
01:49:48,030 --> 01:49:50,630
- 不錯吧  - 你看起來帥極了
- You look lovely. - I look good, huh?

1671
01:49:50,740 --> 01:49:54,140
千萬小心  恭喜你了  祝你好運
You look wonderful. Be careful. Congratulations.

1672
01:49:54,810 --> 01:49:58,140
我愛你  別再畫宗教畫了  拜託你
I love you. Don't paint any more religious pictures, please.

1673
01:49:58,310 --> 01:49:59,900
- 上帝與你同在  - 再見  媽媽
- God be with you. - Bye, Ma.

1674
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:02,410
我們都以好兄弟互相稱呼
We always called each other goodfellas.

1675
01:50:02,580 --> 01:50:04,210
你對某人說
You'd say to somebody:

1676
01:50:04,380 --> 01:50:08,580
你會喜歡他  他是好兄弟  是我們一夥的
"You'll like this guy. He's all right. He's a goodfella, one of us."

1677
01:50:08,950 --> 01:50:10,320
你明白嗎
You understand?

1678
01:50:10,990 --> 01:50:13,320
我們都是好兄弟
We were goodfellas. Wiseguys.

1679
01:50:15,790 --> 01:50:19,160
吉米和我都因為有愛爾蘭血統  而不能被引薦
But Jimmy and I could never be made because we had Irish blood.

1680
01:50:19,330 --> 01:50:21,820
即便我母親是西西里人也沒有用
It didn't matter my mother was Sicilian.

1681
01:50:22,030 --> 01:50:25,970
你一定要百分之百意大利血統才能被正式引薦
To become a member of a crew, you've got to be 100% Italian...

1682
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:29,340
他們要能追蹤出你所有親戚的來歷
so they can trace your relatives back to the old country.

1683
01:50:36,580 --> 01:50:38,810
那是最高的榮譽
It's the highest honor they can give you.

1684
01:50:38,980 --> 01:50:41,480
象徵你已屬於一個家庭  一個團體
It means you belong to a family and a crew.

1685
01:50:41,850 --> 01:50:44,380
那意謂著再沒有人敢傷害你
It means nobody can fuck around with you.

1686
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:47,320
你卻可以任意欺侮
It also means you could fuck around with anybody...

1687
01:50:47,490 --> 01:50:49,930
那些不屬於任何家族的人
just as long as they aren't also a member.

1688
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:53,530
好像擁有偷劫的執照  做任何事的執照
It's like a license to steal. A license to do anything.

1689
01:50:55,700 --> 01:50:57,690
你被正式引薦有多少年了
How many years ago since you were made?

1690
01:50:57,870 --> 01:51:00,600
- 我是老人了  30年前  - 30年前呀
- I'm an old-timer. 30 years ago. - Thirty years?

1691
01:51:00,770 --> 01:51:02,510
是呀  有很多值得回憶的事呀
Brings back a lot of memories.

1692
01:51:02,510 --> 01:51:05,040
派克山當時也只不過一粒青春痘嘛
Pike's Peak was a pimple then, wasn't it?

1693
01:51:08,310 --> 01:51:11,280
對吉米來說  湯米被引薦
As far as Jimmy was concerned, with Tommy being made...

1694
01:51:11,450 --> 01:51:13,850
就像我們都被引薦了一樣
it was like we were all being made.

1695
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:17,250
我們之中有人當了會員了
We would now have one of our own as a member.

1696
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:34,870
- 是誰  - 是韋力
- Who's this? - This is Vinnie.

1697
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:37,840
怎麼回事  儀式完成了嗎
Vinnie. What happened? Did we get straightened out?

1698
01:51:38,010 --> 01:51:41,040
發生一點問題  我們盡力了
No, we had a problem. We tried to do everything we could.

1699
01:51:41,210 --> 01:51:42,200
你是什麼意思
What do you mean?

1700
01:51:42,380 --> 01:51:46,510
我是說他死了  我們也無能為力
You know what I mean. He's gone, and we couldn't do nothing about it.

1701
01:51:48,420 --> 01:51:50,290
- 就這樣  - 你是什麼意思
- That's it. - What do you mean?

1702
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:51,820
他死了
He's gone.

1703
01:51:53,790 --> 01:51:54,820
就這樣
That's it.

1704
01:51:59,730 --> 01:52:02,530
我早就知道會這樣  狗娘養的  我不能相信
I knew it! I can't fucking believe it.

1705
01:52:12,950 --> 01:52:14,070
發生什麼事啦
What happened?

1706
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:16,410
- 他們幹掉他了  - 操
- They fucking whacked him - Fuck.

1707
01:52:32,230 --> 01:52:33,890
你還好嗎
Are you all right?

1708
01:52:40,970 --> 01:52:43,460
那是替比利·貝茲報仇
It was revenge for Billy Batts...

1709
01:52:43,640 --> 01:52:45,540
還有一些舊的積怨
and a lot of other things.

1710
01:52:45,710 --> 01:52:46,700
就是這樣
And that's that.

1711
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:49,280
我們是一點辦法也沒有
There was nothing we could do about it.

1712
01:52:49,450 --> 01:52:52,040
貝茲是黑手黨的  湯米還不是
Batts was a made man and Tommy wasn't.

1713
01:52:52,650 --> 01:52:54,590
我們只是老老實實的逆來順受
We had to sit still and take it.

1714
01:52:54,750 --> 01:52:58,190
意大利人圈子就是這樣  一種毫無道理的規定
It was among the Italians. It was real greaseball shit.

1715
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:12,670
他們甚至打在湯米臉上
They even shot Tommy in the face...

1716
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:16,300
讓他媽媽不能給他開棺瞻仰
so his mother couldn't give him an open coffin at the funeral.

1717
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:29,910
1980年5月11日  星期日  上午6點55分

1718
01:54:03,790 --> 01:54:05,620
我本來預備好要忙一整天的
I was gonna be busy all day. I had to drop off some guns at Jimmy's...

1719
01:54:05,790 --> 01:54:09,060
我要拿槍去給吉米配消音器
to match some silencers he had.

1720
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:12,190
去醫院接我弟弟  帶他回家吃晚飯
I had to pick up my brother at the hospital and drive him home.

1721
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:14,860
然後去取匹茲堡來的貨
I had to pick up some new Pittsburgh stuff for Lois...

1722
01:54:15,030 --> 01:54:18,200
交給露易絲  讓她將貨空運給亞特蘭大附近的客人
to fly down to some customers I had near Atlanta.

1723
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:32,940
我馬上就知道他不會要那些槍  我知道我的錢泡湯了
Right away, I knew he didn't want them, and I'd be stuck for the money.

1724
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:36,820
因為他要我才買的  現在他又不要了
I only bought them because he wanted them, and now he didn't.

1725
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:41,010
這些有什麼鬼用  一個都配不上  你在搞什麼
What good are these? None of them fit. What's the matter with you?

1726
01:54:41,190 --> 01:54:42,520
我才不付錢呢
I'm not paying for it.

1727
01:54:42,690 --> 01:54:46,360
我一句話也沒講  吉米氣得連再見都沒說
I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed off, he didn't even say goodbye.

1728
01:54:46,530 --> 01:54:48,970
別再吸毒了  你的腦子都快不管用了
Stop the drugs. They're making your mind into mush!

1729
01:54:49,130 --> 01:54:50,930
- 聽見沒有  - 我把它們帶回去就是了
- You hear me? - I'll take them back.

1730
01:54:55,640 --> 01:54:58,910
上午8點05分

1731
01:55:03,950 --> 01:55:05,920
那些匹茲堡傢伙  總是在買槍
My Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.

1732
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:09,680
我下午反正要去見他們  去取貨
Since I would see them in the afternoon to pick up a delivery...

1733
01:55:09,860 --> 01:55:12,380
我蠻肯定我能賺回本的
I was pretty sure I'd get my money back.

1734
01:55:31,410 --> 01:55:32,400
我的老天呀
Oh, my God.

1735
01:55:32,850 --> 01:55:33,650
上午8點45分

1736
01:55:33,650 --> 01:55:38,340
當我終於到了醫院接麥可  醫生說我該住院了
When I finally got to the hospital, Michael's doctor wanted to put me in bed.

1737
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:40,610
上帝呀  你發生什麼事了
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?

1738
01:55:41,650 --> 01:55:44,020
剛才差點撞車
I almost got into an accident on the way here.

1739
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:47,090
我描述了車禍  又說昨夜狂歡沒睡
And I told him I was partying all night.

1740
01:55:47,260 --> 01:55:49,060
- 我沒事  - 好啦  到這邊來
- I'm fine. - Come on. Get over here.

1741
01:55:49,230 --> 01:55:51,320
- 醫師  我沒事  - 我給你做個檢查
- Doc, I'm fine. - Let me check you out.

1742
01:55:51,830 --> 01:55:52,990
好啦
Come on.

1743
01:55:56,030 --> 01:55:58,700
他很同情我  只給了我10毫克鎮靜劑
He took mercy on me, gave me 10 milligrams of Valium...

1744
01:55:58,870 --> 01:55:59,930
就讓我回去了
and sent me home.

1745
01:56:00,740 --> 01:56:04,470
我計劃把弟弟送回家  同時把凱倫接上
My plan was to drop off my brother at the house and pick up Karen.

1746
01:56:06,440 --> 01:56:09,680
你看見沒有  一架直升機
There it is. You see that helicopter right there?

1747
01:56:09,850 --> 01:56:13,250
就在我們前面  它跟了我一早上了
Right in front of us, there. I think it's been following me all morning.

1748
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:16,180
- 別瞎扯了  它跟蹤你幹什麼  - 我告訴你
- Get the fuck out. What are you, nuts? - I'm telling you.

1749
01:56:16,350 --> 01:56:17,550
我也不知道是怎麼回事
I don't know what's going on.

1750
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:20,750
這是我第三次看到它  我去醫院接你也看到了
It's the third time I've seen it. At the hospital I saw it.

1751
01:56:20,930 --> 01:56:23,450
中途停了兩次  每次都看到它
I had to make some stops. I've seen it every time.

1752
01:56:23,630 --> 01:56:26,030
我跑了好多地方  整天都看到它
I've been all over town and I've seen it all day.

1753
01:56:32,870 --> 01:56:34,600
那天由我做晚餐
I was cooking dinner that night.

1754
01:56:32,870 --> 01:56:34,870
{\an8}上午11點30分

1755
01:56:34,770 --> 01:56:39,270
我必須把肉汁熬出來做蕃茄配料
I had to start braising the beef and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.

1756
01:56:41,950 --> 01:56:45,180
是麥可最喜歡的菜  我做了肉醬
It was Michael's favorite. I was making ziti with meat gravy...

1757
01:56:45,350 --> 01:56:47,840
還打算烤辣椒
and I'm planning to roast some peppers over the flames...

1758
01:56:48,020 --> 01:56:51,960
橄欖油豆  大蒜等
put on some string beans with olive oil. I had some beautiful cutlets...

1759
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:53,180
我還有切得很好的小牛肉
that were cut just right...

1760
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:56,350
打算炸好了當開胃菜
that I was going to fry up as an appetizer.

1761
01:56:56,560 --> 01:56:58,500
我在家停留了約一小時
So, I was home for about an hour.

1762
01:56:58,730 --> 01:57:00,700
現在我計劃提早吃晚飯
My plan was to start the dinner early...

1763
01:57:00,870 --> 01:57:03,390
凱倫和我可以把槍推銷掉
so Karen and I could unload the guns Jimmy didn't want...

1764
01:57:03,570 --> 01:57:04,970
同時把貨取回來給露易絲
then get the package for Lois...

1765
01:57:05,140 --> 01:57:07,700
由她跑一趟亞特蘭大
to take to Atlanta for her trip later that night.

1766
01:57:08,570 --> 01:57:12,370
我不時從窗戶看出去  直升機已經不在了
I kept looking out the window, and I saw that the helicopter was gone.

1767
01:57:12,980 --> 01:57:16,470
麥可  注意蕃茄汁好嗎  你留在這裏陪麥可叔叔
Michael, keep an eye on the sauce. Stay here with your Uncle Michael.

1768
01:57:17,620 --> 01:57:21,380
我請麥可注意配料  我和凱倫就出去了
So I asked my brother to watch the sauce, and Karen and I started out.

1769
01:57:24,290 --> 01:57:26,350
天呀  我看見了
Oh, God. I see it.

1770
01:57:26,630 --> 01:57:29,120
- 我看見了  就在那兒  - 該死
- I see it. Look, it's right there. - Damn!

1771
01:57:30,330 --> 01:57:31,760
- 就是它  - 就在那邊
- That's it. - There it is.

1772
01:57:31,930 --> 01:57:33,560
我們去你媽媽家
We got to get to your mother's.

1773
01:57:34,170 --> 01:57:35,430
看見了吧  我告訴你了嘛
See, I told you.

1774
01:57:35,630 --> 01:57:37,000
是很奇怪
It's funny.

1775
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:40,240
- 但並不是世界末日  - 我們先去你媽媽家
- It's not the end of the world. - We're going to your mother's.

1776
01:58:08,930 --> 01:58:12,700
進去告訴你媽媽  外面的東西不要碰  好嗎
Go inside, tell your mother not to touch anything outside the house. Nothing.

1777
01:58:12,870 --> 01:58:15,530
為什麼不到你媽媽家去  非要到我媽家來
We couldn't go to your mother's house? You had to come here.

1778
01:58:21,110 --> 01:58:22,770
來  去購物吧
Let's go shopping.

1779
01:58:25,020 --> 01:58:27,760
沒有  我沒瘋  這死東西跟了我一早上
I'm not nuts, it's been following me all morning.

1780
01:58:25,900 --> 01:58:27,900
{\an8}中午12點30分

1781
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:29,280
我跟你講啦
I'm telling you.

1782
01:58:30,420 --> 01:58:33,690
好啦  好啦  他說我疑心病太重
Fine. Fine. He thinks I'm paranoid!

1783
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:38,160
我應該把直升機帶到他那  看我是不是疑心病
I should bring him the helicopter, then we'll see how paranoid I am.

1784
01:58:40,170 --> 01:58:42,030
我們進去吧
Come on, let's go inside.

1785
01:58:42,570 --> 01:58:45,970
下午1點30分

1786
01:58:46,140 --> 01:58:47,400
不見了
Yeah, it's gone.

1787
01:58:47,570 --> 01:58:50,100
-我聽不見聲音了  -來吧  回你媽媽家
- I don't hear anything. - Let's go back to your mother's.

1788
01:58:56,180 --> 01:58:59,780
下午3點30分

1789
01:59:03,420 --> 01:59:05,980
- 還可以嗎  - 太好了  太好了
- They all right? - Beautiful. They're great.

1790
01:59:06,830 --> 01:59:09,490
我不是說了  你是疑心病嗎  我告訴你  他是多心罷了
Didn't I tell you, you were paranoid? Didn't I tell him?

1791
01:59:09,660 --> 01:59:11,150
是呀  我需要吸一口
Yeah. I need a hit.

1792
01:59:11,730 --> 01:59:14,720
你要看直升機嗎  來  我給你看直升機
Want to see helicopters? Come on, I'll show you helicopters.

1793
01:59:15,370 --> 01:59:17,860
我今天看夠直升機了
I've seen enough helicopters for one day, thank you.

1794
01:59:18,870 --> 01:59:23,200
我計劃先回家  把包裹準備給露易絲帶上路
I had to get home and get the package ready for Lois to take on her trip.

1795
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:27,240
我還要去珊蒂家  讓她把奎寧注射進去
Also, I had to get to Sandy's to give the package a whack with quinine.

1796
01:59:27,580 --> 01:59:29,810
加上珊蒂一定會囉嗦我沒去陪她
Plus, I knew Sandy would get on my ass.

1797
01:59:29,980 --> 01:59:33,710
我還得做菜  還有幫助露易絲啟程
I had the cooking to finish, and I had to get Lois ready for her trip.

1798
01:59:33,890 --> 01:59:36,410
- 是珊蒂啦  這是怎樣啊  - 她煩得很啦
- It's Sandy. What is this? - She's a pain in the ass.

1799
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:39,850
- 你什麼時候過來  - 我一小時之內會去
- When are you coming over? - In an hour.

1800
01:59:40,030 --> 01:59:43,020
- 你今天在我這兒過夜吧  - 不行  我要照顧我弟弟
- You staying tonight, right? - I can't. I got my brother tonight.

1801
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:47,420
好了  別說了  再見
Come on, stop. We'll talk about it later, okay? Goodbye.

1802
01:59:55,070 --> 01:59:57,060
- 哈羅  - 你準備好了沒有
- Hello? - It's me. You ready?

1803
01:59:58,080 --> 02:00:00,910
叫麥可注意不要讓配料太濃  要不停攪拌
Tell Michael not to let the sauce stick. Keep stirring it.

1804
02:00:01,480 --> 02:00:05,310
- 亨利說不要讓配料太濃  - 我在攪拌
- Henry says don't let the sauce stick. - I'm stirring it.

1805
02:00:05,480 --> 02:00:07,310
- 你知道該怎麼做嗎  - 知道  知道
- Listen, you know what to do? - Yeah, yeah.

1806
02:00:07,490 --> 02:00:09,720
不要跟我來  知道  知道  這一套  這是很重要的事
Don't "yeah, yeah" me, Lois. This is important.

1807
02:00:09,890 --> 02:00:12,320
你到外面去再打電話
Make sure you leave the house when you make the call.

1808
02:00:12,490 --> 02:00:15,650
懂不懂  用公用電話  你聽見沒有  不是鬧著玩的
Understand me? Call from an outside line. I mean it.

1809
02:00:15,830 --> 02:00:19,490
上帝  你把我當呆子呀  少煩我  我知道該怎麼做
Jesus, you must think I'm dumb. Why are you bugging me? I know what to do.

1810
02:00:19,660 --> 02:00:22,260
沒常識  你最好別弄糟事情
You little hick, just make sure you do it.

1811
02:00:22,430 --> 02:00:23,420
你就是會讓人不舒服
You can be such a pain.

1812
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:27,700
- 你就照我的意思做  - 知道啦
- Hey! Just do it! - Okay.

1813
02:00:28,310 --> 02:00:32,830
真沒法相信  我生命中的每個女人都是這樣的
Un-fucking-believable. All of them. Every fucking girl in my life.

1814
02:00:34,180 --> 02:00:36,310
- 他說什麼  - 沒什麼
- What did he say? - Nothing.

1815
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:38,780
她掛上電話以後  你猜她做了什麼
What does she do after she hangs up with me?

1816
02:00:38,950 --> 02:00:42,440
雖然她說了一大堆  知道  知道  雖然我一再警告她
After everything I told her? After all her "yeah, yeah"bullshit?

1817
02:00:42,620 --> 02:00:45,250
她居然拿起電話就打
She picks up the phone and calls from the house.

1818
02:00:45,420 --> 02:00:47,720
假如被裝了竊聽器  那對方什麼都清楚了
If anybody was listening, they'd know everything.

1819
02:00:47,890 --> 02:00:49,830
一袋包裹將從我家送出
They'd know a package was leaving my house...

1820
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:53,230
甚至班機號碼及時間
and they'd even have the time and flight number, thanks to her.

1821
02:00:54,470 --> 02:00:56,630
As soon as I got home, I started cooking.
我一到家就開始做晚餐

1822
02:00:54,470 --> 02:00:56,630
{\an8}傍晚6點30分

1823
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:59,330
離露易絲起飛時間有幾小時
I had a few hours until Lois' flight.

1824
02:00:59,500 --> 02:01:01,600
我告訴弟弟注意爐子
I told my brother to watch the stove.

1825
02:01:01,770 --> 02:01:04,870
可憐的小子  一整天都在看蕃茄汁和直升機
All day long the guy's been watching helicopters and tomato sauce.

1826
02:01:06,340 --> 02:01:10,970
我得去珊蒂家把貨混好再回來做肉汁
I had to drive over to Sandy's, mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy.

1827
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:13,240
晚上8點30分

1828
02:01:22,160 --> 02:01:24,990
你以為可以隨便來  下了床  屁股一拍就走人嗎
Do you think you can come over here, fuck me, and leave?

1829
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:27,420
- 別這樣嘛  - 你還有更好的地方要去嗎
- Come on. - You got someplace better to go?

1830
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:30,090
別這樣講
Don't talk like that. Come on.

1831
02:01:30,470 --> 02:01:32,270
- 你沒事吧  - 沒事啦
- You all right? - Yeah, sure.

1832
02:01:32,440 --> 02:01:33,460
你相信我嗎
You believe me?

1833
02:01:34,870 --> 02:01:36,200
你相信我嗎
Do you believe me?

1834
02:01:36,570 --> 02:01:37,670
你相信我嗎
Do you believe me?

1835
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:41,500
- 那是最後一批了吧  - 是呀
- That the last one? - Yeah.

1836
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:53,320
你這狗娘養的騙子  我恨你
You lying son of a bitch. I hate you!

1837
02:01:53,930 --> 02:01:56,720
晚上10點45分

1838
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:04,200
不要在桌子上餵狗
Please stop feeding the dog from the table...

1839
02:02:04,370 --> 02:02:06,630
更不要用盤子餵他  不許這樣
from the plate on top of it. Stop it.

1840
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:09,170
- 我不喂不行  - 沒什麼不行的
- I have to. - You don't have to.

1841
02:02:14,110 --> 02:02:15,600
我得回家一趟
I got to go home.

1842
02:02:17,620 --> 02:02:19,550
什麼叫你得回家一趟
What do you mean, you got to go home?

1843
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:21,010
我帶著這些貨跑了一早上
I've been carrying this all day.

1844
02:02:21,190 --> 02:02:23,780
你該開始把它粘在大腿上  我們差不多該走了
We got to start taping it to your leg. We got to go soon.

1845
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:25,890
我要回去拿我的帽子
I got to go home and get my hat.

1846
02:02:26,790 --> 02:02:29,020
你在開我玩笑呀  什麼鬼帽子
Forget your fucking hat. Are you kidding me?

1847
02:02:29,590 --> 02:02:32,360
要我載你回去拿帽子
So I need a trip to Rockaway because you want your hat?

1848
02:02:32,530 --> 02:02:36,400
我需要它  那是我的幸運帽  沒有它我絕不上路
I need it, I got to have it. It's my lucky hat. I never fly without it.

1849
02:02:36,670 --> 02:02:40,660
露易絲  你知道我們所做的事有多嚴重嗎
Lois, do you understand what we are involved in here?

1850
02:02:41,140 --> 02:02:44,170
我管不了那麼多  沒有帽子  我就不上飛機
I don't care. I need my hat. I won't fly without it.

1851
02:02:49,110 --> 02:02:53,280
我能怎麼辦  她堅持要她的帽子
What could I do if she insisted I drive her home for her goddamn hat?

1852
02:02:53,450 --> 02:02:55,920
我把包裹藏在廚房  我只好帶她回去
I hid the package in the kitchen and went to take her home.

1853
02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:57,350
帽子
A hat?

1854
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:07,330
這是什麼情況
What the fuck is this?

1855
02:03:07,770 --> 02:03:10,290
警察  別動  不許動  你這人渣
Police! Freeze! Don't you move, you motherfucker...

1856
02:03:10,470 --> 02:03:13,490
否則我會把你腦漿打出來  慢慢熄火
or I'll blow your brains out. Shut the car off slowly.

1857
02:03:17,510 --> 02:03:19,670
剎那之間  我以為我已經死了
For a second, I thought I was dead.

1858
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:22,180
但當我聽到吵雜聲  我知道那些是警察
But when I heard all the noise, I knew they were cops.

1859
02:03:22,350 --> 02:03:23,910
只有條子  才用那種口氣說話
Only cops talk that way.

1860
02:03:24,250 --> 02:03:25,410
你他媽老實點
Don't fucking move.

1861
02:03:25,580 --> 02:03:29,040
如果是幫派兄弟  我會連一點聲音都聽不見
If they had been wiseguys, I wouldn't have heard a thing.

1862
02:03:29,950 --> 02:03:31,550
就被打死了
I would have been dead.

1863
02:03:32,590 --> 02:03:34,020
麥可  把門鎖上
Michael, lock the door!

1864
02:03:56,310 --> 02:03:58,410
餘波

1865
02:03:58,580 --> 02:04:01,210
你最後一次被捕是什麼時候
Talk to me. When was the last time you took a collar?

1866
02:04:01,650 --> 02:04:03,250
說呀
Fuckhead, I'm talking to you.

1867
02:04:03,420 --> 02:04:07,080
你一個字也不肯說  你什麼也不用說  我不在乎
You don't want to say a fucking word, don't. I don't really give a fuck.

1868
02:04:07,260 --> 02:04:11,350
等你要被關25年的時候  看你還能對你朋友多忠心
You'll do 25 years. See how much of a good guy you'll be then.

1869
02:04:11,530 --> 02:04:13,550
我一直以為直升機上的人
All day I thought the guys in the helicopter...

1870
02:04:13,730 --> 02:04:18,330
是為了德航劫案在跟蹤我  原來他們是緝毒組的
were local cops busting my balls over Lufthansa. They turned out to be narcs.

1871
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:19,490
把律師叫來就好了
Just get the lawyer.

1872
02:04:19,670 --> 02:04:23,230
他們盯了我一個月了  竊聽電話  跟蹤行程  全套都來
They'd been on me a month. Phone taps, surveillance, everything.

1873
02:04:23,410 --> 02:04:26,070
你認識這些夥計  你的搭檔都被抓了
You know the boys. All the pals are here.

1874
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:29,180
你要是不說  我會整晚像蒼蠅一樣叮咬你
You don't want to talk to me, you'll have a problem all night.

1875
02:04:30,010 --> 02:04:33,880
在紐約  這任何一項罪名都可以判你25年監禁
Each one of these counts holds 25-to-life in New York State.

1876
02:04:34,050 --> 02:04:38,610
25年呀  老兄  你身心都會受不了那種壓力的
Twenty-five fucking years, pal. I'll slap your fucking head inside out.

1877
02:04:39,390 --> 02:04:41,650
你們去哪兒  買雜貨呀
What, were you guys grocery shopping?

1878
02:04:43,060 --> 02:04:46,900
要做蛋糕呀  你也要做蛋糕呀
Are we going to make a cake? You going to make a fucking cake?

1879
02:04:47,130 --> 02:04:49,290
有沒有找到什麼好東西呀
You got anything good in there?

1880
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:52,060
是不是白粉呀
Is it good?

1881
02:04:57,180 --> 02:04:58,730
再見啦  鳥蛋
Bye-bye, dickhead.

1882
02:05:01,880 --> 02:05:03,610
阿迪卡監獄見啦
See you in Attica, dick.

1883
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:07,110
我跟吉米談過了  他願意給我一點錢
I spoke to Jimmy. He offered to give me some money.

1884
02:05:07,690 --> 02:05:10,920
他想知道發生什麼事了  他要跟你談談
He just wants to know what's happening. He just wants to talk to you.

1885
02:05:11,090 --> 02:05:12,520
去他的吉米  去他的錢
Fuck Jimmy and his money.

1886
02:05:12,690 --> 02:05:15,890
我一定得想辦法出去  把事情向保利擺平  否則我死定了
I got to straighten out everything with Paulie or I'm dead.

1887
02:05:16,790 --> 02:05:18,420
那也許你在裏面還安全點
Then you're better off staying in here.

1888
02:05:18,600 --> 02:05:22,160
他們在裏面一樣可以幹掉我  也許還更容易
They could whack me in here as easy as outside, maybe even easier.

1889
02:05:22,330 --> 02:05:23,960
他們都擔心我會把事情抖出來
They're afraid I'll rat them out.

1890
02:05:24,140 --> 02:05:26,240
他們已經在避我了  我在裏面遲早是死路一條
People are already walking away from me. I'm dead in here.

1891
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:27,970
你一定要把我弄出去
You got to get me out.

1892
02:05:28,570 --> 02:05:33,170
凱倫終於讓她媽媽拿房子抵押  保我出來
Karen finally got her mother to put her house up for my bail and I was out.

1893
02:05:33,340 --> 02:05:37,440
我有種感覺  我一出監牢就會被殺
I remember I had this feeling I would be killed right outside the jail.

1894
02:05:37,850 --> 02:05:41,050
我知道保利還在生我的氣  他那種死脾氣的人
I knew Paulie was still pissed at me, and he's such a hothead.

1895
02:05:41,220 --> 02:05:42,950
我也替吉米擔心
And I was worried about Jimmy.

1896
02:05:43,120 --> 02:05:47,420
吉米自己也很清楚狀況  如果保利知道他跟我在搞販毒
See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out he was into drug deals with me...

1897
02:05:48,130 --> 02:05:51,150
他會比我還先死
Paulie would have Jimmy whacked even before me.

1898
02:05:52,860 --> 02:05:54,490
情勢對我很不利
This is the bad time.

1899
02:05:55,370 --> 02:05:57,630
到家之後我才有點安全感
I didn't feel safe until I got home.

1900
02:05:59,470 --> 02:06:03,240
現在我要好好計劃保住性命  盡快把貨脫手
Now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope...

1901
02:06:03,410 --> 02:06:07,970
躲起來一陣子  讓我慢慢把所有事情擺平
the cops never found, then disappear until I can get things straightened out.

1902
02:06:09,610 --> 02:06:10,600
操
Fuck!

1903
02:06:10,780 --> 02:06:14,510
- 凱倫  我藏起來的那批貨呢  - 我衝下馬桶了
- Where's the stuff I left, Karen? - I flushed it down the toilet.

1904
02:06:16,250 --> 02:06:17,280
你幹了什麼
You what?

1905
02:06:17,890 --> 02:06:20,410
我該怎麼辦  到處都是條子
What was I supposed to do? They were all over the house.

1906
02:06:20,590 --> 02:06:24,650
那是我們的全部財產  價值6萬塊  我需要那些錢
That was worth $60,000! I need that money! That's all we got!

1907
02:06:24,830 --> 02:06:27,490
我能怎麼辦  他們有搜查令
What was I supposed to do? They had a search warrant!

1908
02:06:27,670 --> 02:06:32,100
你為什麼要這麼做  我們只有那些錢
That's all the money we had! I was depending on that! Why did you do that?

1909
02:06:32,640 --> 02:06:35,440
我沒辦法  他們一定會找到的
I had to. They were going to find it!

1910
02:06:35,610 --> 02:06:39,570
- 他們絕不會找到的  - 我敢發誓
- They would have never found it! - They would have, I swear to you!

1911
02:06:41,010 --> 02:06:42,670
他們一定會找到的
They would've found it!

1912
02:06:44,120 --> 02:06:45,550
你為什麼要這樣做
Why did you do that?

1913
02:06:45,720 --> 02:06:49,280
- 他們一定會找到的  - 你為什麼要這樣做
- They would have found it. - Why did you do that, Karen?

1914
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:52,460
我的天呀
Oh, my God!

1915
02:06:52,920 --> 02:06:55,860
- 我是迫不得已  - 我的天呀
- I had to do it. - Oh, my God.

1916
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,930
保利  我真的很抱歉
Paulie, I'm really sorry.

1917
02:07:36,600 --> 02:07:39,700
我不知道該說什麼才好  我知道我犯了嚴重的錯誤
I don't know what else to say. I know I fucked up.

1918
02:07:39,870 --> 02:07:41,360
你搞砸了
Yeah, you fucked up.

1919
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:46,780
但我現在沒事了
But I'm all right now.

1920
02:07:48,350 --> 02:07:52,720
你可以相信我  我拿我孩子做保證
I can be trusted now. I'm clean. On my kids, I'm clean.

1921
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:55,080
你睜著眼對我說謊
You looked in my eyes and lied to me.

1922
02:07:56,390 --> 02:07:58,510
把我當冤大頭
You treated me like a fucking jerk.

1923
02:07:59,120 --> 02:08:00,610
毫無份量
Like I was never nothing to you.

1924
02:08:00,790 --> 02:08:03,660
你警告過我們  所以我更不敢向你說實話了
After what you said, I couldn't come to you.

1925
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:07,160
我從那時起到現在
You know, I was ashamed.

1926
02:08:10,200 --> 02:08:12,170
都很慚愧
I'm ashamed now.

1927
02:08:15,510 --> 02:08:17,700
但是我已經走投無路了  保利
But I got nowhere else to go, Paulie.

1928
02:08:20,910 --> 02:08:25,210
我現在只有求你了  我真的需要你的幫助
You're all I've got. And I really need your help. I really do.

1929
02:08:31,420 --> 02:08:32,480
拿著
Take this.

1930
02:08:47,540 --> 02:08:49,670
從現在起我不認識你了
And now I've got to turn my back on you.

1931
02:09:00,080 --> 02:09:01,750
三千兩百塊
$3,200.

1932
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:06,310
一生替他做事  他就給了我三千兩百塊
That's what he gave me. $3,200 for a lifetime.

1933
02:09:07,220 --> 02:09:09,450
連買棺材都不夠
It wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.

1934
02:09:09,660 --> 02:09:11,690
- 我們得跑路了  - 我不想跑
- We got to get out. - I don't want to run.

1935
02:09:11,860 --> 02:09:16,230
難道你要我放棄一切  找地方躲起來嗎
I don't want to. Am I supposed to pick up and leave everything? Go hiding?

1936
02:09:16,670 --> 02:09:19,160
我不要  那就是你所要的生活嗎
I don't want to do that. Is that what you want?

1937
02:09:19,340 --> 02:09:21,500
我們留在這裏  我們就死定了
If we stay around here, we're dead.

1938
02:09:22,270 --> 02:09:24,100
死定了  懂不懂
You got it? We're dead.

1939
02:09:24,740 --> 02:09:25,730
他們說得沒錯
They're right.

1940
02:09:26,340 --> 02:09:29,310
你藥嗑太多了  你已經完全神經過敏了
You took too much of that stuff. You're totally paranoid.

1941
02:09:32,950 --> 02:09:34,710
他還好吧  有沒有找他麻煩
How's he doing? Busting his balls or what?

1942
02:09:34,890 --> 02:09:35,870
他還好
He's okay.

1943
02:09:37,090 --> 02:09:38,350
他把嗑藥的毛病改掉了
They sobered him up.

1944
02:09:38,860 --> 02:09:40,720
那就好
Good. Very good. Glad to hear it.

1945
02:09:44,930 --> 02:09:47,230
他有沒有告訴你  條子問了他一些什麼樣的問題
You know what kind of questions they're asking him?

1946
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:48,990
吉米  我不知道
Jimmy, I don't know.

1947
02:09:50,070 --> 02:09:53,590
我心情太亂了  我又沒有錢
I got my mind on so many other things. I got no money...

1948
02:09:54,170 --> 02:09:56,770
孩子們都已經會看報紙了
The girls are old enough to read the newspapers.

1949
02:09:56,940 --> 02:09:58,970
你回去叫他馬上給我打電話
Tell him he's got to call me. Okay?

1950
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:03,470
我們要好好處理這件事  這是非常重要的
As soon as you talk to him, he's got to call me. It's important.

1951
02:10:03,810 --> 02:10:07,410
他不知道我來找你  他現在不是很正常
He doesn't know I came here to see you. It's like he's crazy.

1952
02:10:07,590 --> 02:10:10,650
- 先拿去救急  有幾千塊錢  - 謝了  吉米
- Take this. It's a couple of thousands. - Thanks, Jimmy.

1953
02:10:10,890 --> 02:10:12,820
不要太擔心好嗎  一切都會過去的
Don't worry, everything will be all right.

1954
02:10:12,990 --> 02:10:16,290
我有一批很漂亮的迪奧女裙
I got some beautiful Dior dresses. You want to have them?

1955
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:18,430
去挑幾件喜歡的吧
Pick out a few for yourself.

1956
02:10:19,230 --> 02:10:20,890
- 挑給我媽媽  - 可以  沒問題  隨便挑
- For my mom. - Yeah, whatever.

1957
02:10:21,330 --> 02:10:23,990
不  不  是在轉角倉庫
No. It's over here. In the store on the corner.

1958
02:10:24,170 --> 02:10:26,570
因為是贓物  我放在角落
It's swag, so I got it down on the corner.

1959
02:10:32,540 --> 02:10:34,030
去吧  甜心  再見
Go ahead, sweetheart, I'll see you.

1960
02:10:34,480 --> 02:10:36,210
- 謝謝  吉米  - 不用擔心
- Thanks, Jimmy. - Don't worry.

1961
02:10:36,410 --> 02:10:39,010
- 我知道  - 不要忘了  打電話給我
- I'll try. - Don't forget, he's got to call me.

1962
02:10:41,620 --> 02:10:43,810
- 這邊嗎  - 一直走
- Over here? - Right down there.

1963
02:10:58,870 --> 02:11:00,530
一直走  在轉角
It's over there, on the corner.

1964
02:11:01,210 --> 02:11:02,470
就在那裏
Right there.

1965
02:11:36,670 --> 02:11:38,800
不是  去呀  就在裏面
No, go ahead. It's right in there.

1966
02:11:38,980 --> 02:11:41,070
不用了  吉米  我在趕時間
No, Jimmy. I'm in a hurry!

1967
02:11:41,410 --> 02:11:44,210
我媽在看孩子  我得回去
My mom's watching the kids! I got to get home!

1968
02:11:44,380 --> 02:11:45,870
以後再來拿
I'll come back later!

1969
02:12:08,340 --> 02:12:09,970
凱倫
Karen!

1970
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:15,500
發生什麼事了
What happened?

1971
02:12:16,910 --> 02:12:17,940
沒事
Nothing.

1972
02:12:18,550 --> 02:12:20,450
- 到底什麼事  - 我只是突然怕起來了
- What happened? - I just got scared.

1973
02:12:23,950 --> 02:12:25,080
車鑰匙拿了沒有
Got the keys?

1974
02:12:26,860 --> 02:12:30,490
- 到底什麼事  - 我只是害怕起來了
- What happened, Karen? - I just got scared. It's okay.

1975
02:12:30,660 --> 02:12:32,250
- 沒事吧  - 現在沒事了
- Are you all right? - Yeah.

1976
02:12:39,170 --> 02:12:43,730
如果你是黑手黨員  你永遠不會知道幾時會被殺
If you're part of a crew, nobody ever tells you they're going to kill you.

1977
02:12:44,280 --> 02:12:46,040
沒人會事先通知你的
It doesn't happen that way.

1978
02:12:46,210 --> 02:12:49,650
也不像電影裏先大吵大罵
There aren't any arguments or curses like in the movies.

1979
02:12:49,810 --> 02:12:53,880
來殺你的人面帶笑容  像是你很親近的朋友
Your murderers come with smiles. They come as your friends.

1980
02:12:54,050 --> 02:12:56,080
他們一直很關心你
People who cared for you all your life.

1981
02:12:56,250 --> 02:13:00,620
在你有困難時  他們總會來幫助你
They always seem to come when you're weakest and most in need of their help.

1982
02:13:00,990 --> 02:13:04,220
所以我跟吉米約好在人多的地方見面
So I met Jimmy in a crowded place we both knew.

1983
02:13:04,600 --> 02:13:08,590
我早到了15分鐘  可吉米已經比我先到了
I got there 15 minutes early, and Jimmy was already there.

1984
02:13:09,030 --> 02:13:13,440
他佔了靠窗的雅座  凡是來餐廳的人  他都看得見
He took the booth near the window so he could see everyone who drove up.

1985
02:13:13,770 --> 02:13:16,140
他要確認我沒有被跟蹤
He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.

1986
02:13:16,570 --> 02:13:19,440
他很緊張  什麼也沒吃
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing.

1987
02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:23,500
表面看來一點也沒事
On the surface, everything was supposed to be fine.

1988
02:13:23,680 --> 02:13:26,010
我們應該是要商量我的案子
We were supposed to be discussing my case.

1989
02:13:26,180 --> 02:13:31,120
但我可以感覺到吉米在試探我是否會為了救自己而出賣他
But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck.

1990
02:13:32,790 --> 02:13:36,520
我一直提醒你  不要在電話上談事情
I been telling you your whole life, don't talk on the phone.

1991
02:13:36,730 --> 02:13:38,520
現在你明白了
Now you understand?

1992
02:13:41,170 --> 02:13:44,500
我想你勝訴的機會很大  一切會沒問題的
It's going to be okay. You got a good chance to beat the case.

1993
02:13:47,670 --> 02:13:51,940
那個小子  你知道我是在說誰吧
You know that kid from the city we were talking about? You know?

1994
02:13:54,350 --> 02:13:58,580
那是個告密者  他一被捕就把所有的人都招供出來了
The kid turned out to be a rat. As soon as he got pinched, he ratted on everybody.

1995
02:14:01,350 --> 02:14:03,290
我知道他現在躲在哪裏
I know where he is. He's hiding now.

1996
02:14:05,220 --> 02:14:06,550
懂不懂我說的
Know what I'm saying?

1997
02:14:11,530 --> 02:14:14,690
你想你能和安東尼一方面度假  一方面把他解決掉嗎
Would you have a problem going with Anthony to take care of that?

1998
02:14:17,800 --> 02:14:18,860
沒問題
No, not at all.

1999
02:14:20,670 --> 02:14:22,260
這樣他們就沒證人了
That way they got nothing.

2000
02:14:31,120 --> 02:14:33,850
吉米從來沒有叫我替他除掉任何人
Jimmy had never asked me to whack somebody before.

2001
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:37,980
現在他叫我和安東尼一起到佛羅里達去為他殺人
But now he's asking me to go to Florida and do a hit with Anthony.

2002
02:14:45,530 --> 02:14:48,860
那時候我就知道  如果我去了佛州  我不會活著回來
That's when I knew I would never have come back from Florida alive.

2003
02:15:03,650 --> 02:15:06,550
不論你要把我們搬去哪裏  我說過
Whenever you move me, I asked once and I'll tell you again...

2004
02:15:06,720 --> 02:15:08,550
我不去寒冷的地方
I don't want to go any place cold.

2005
02:15:09,550 --> 02:15:11,710
你並沒有選擇餘地
You don't have a choice in that matter.

2006
02:15:12,120 --> 02:15:14,650
到底是誰管這個
Come on. Whoever fucking controls it...

2007
02:15:15,460 --> 02:15:18,090
幫個忙  只要不是寒冷地方就行
just no place cold. Do that for me. I'm trying to...

2008
02:15:18,260 --> 02:15:19,990
他有氣管炎
He's bronchial, that's why.

2009
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:22,720
如果檢查後他真有氣管炎  我們會列入考慮因素
If he's legitimately bronchial, we'll consider that.

2010
02:15:22,900 --> 02:15:25,100
我希望去不冷的地方
I'd like to go someplace not cold.

2011
02:15:25,270 --> 02:15:29,000
我能問一些問題嗎  我父母會怎麼樣
Can I ask you some questions? What about my parents?

2012
02:15:30,110 --> 02:15:31,100
他們怎麼啦
What about them?

2013
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:33,770
我能不能見他們  跟他們通消息
Am I going to see them? Am I going to talk to them?

2014
02:15:35,010 --> 02:15:37,410
怎麼跟他們聯絡
Don't I have some kind of contact with them?

2015
02:15:38,080 --> 02:15:39,110
不能
No.

2016
02:15:40,250 --> 02:15:43,580
等一等  你是說
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You mean to tell me that...

2017
02:15:43,950 --> 02:15:47,980
就算我父母生病了  我也不能去看他們嗎
God forbid something happens to my parents, they get sick, I can't see them?

2018
02:15:48,160 --> 02:15:51,150
也許可以特別安排  如果他們病了
Maybe something can be worked out if they're sick...

2019
02:15:51,630 --> 02:15:53,790
情形特殊的話
if there's extraordinary circumstances...

2020
02:15:53,960 --> 02:15:56,830
我不能這樣做  亨利
I can't do this. I can't do this, Henry.

2021
02:15:57,940 --> 02:15:59,700
我不能留下我父母不管
I can't leave my parents.

2022
02:16:00,940 --> 02:16:03,130
抱歉  凱倫  我跟你說了
Excuse me, Karen, I told you before.

2023
02:16:04,410 --> 02:16:07,400
除非你跟孩子們和我在一起  我不會同意這個證人保護行動
I'm not going to do this unless you and the kids come with me.

2024
02:16:09,750 --> 02:16:11,410
我沒有辦法一個人捱過這些
I can't do it without you.

2025
02:16:11,850 --> 02:16:15,910
你要怎麼做就怎麼做  可是  就這樣
So, you do whatever, but... that's it.

2026
02:16:17,450 --> 02:16:19,980
- 你們需要亨利  並不需要我  對不對  - 沒錯
- You need Henry, not me, right? - That's right.

2027
02:16:20,360 --> 02:16:22,790
老實說  我並不在乎你去不去
Frankly, I don't care whether you go or not.

2028
02:16:23,090 --> 02:16:26,360
如果能使他成為一個快樂而有用的證人  我希望你去
If it'll make him a better witness, I'd like you to be with him.

2029
02:16:26,530 --> 02:16:28,230
他們要的是亨利  不是我
They want Henry, not me.

2030
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:31,460
亨利會受到保護  他們動不了他
Henry'll be in the protection program. They can't get to him.

2031
02:16:32,400 --> 02:16:35,840
他們只能從你跟孩子身上動手來傷害亨利
They can only get to him by getting to you or your kids.

2032
02:16:36,010 --> 02:16:38,410
假如他參與這次行動  你的處境就很危險
If he goes into the program, you're in danger...

2033
02:16:38,580 --> 02:16:41,010
- 我什麼也不知道呀  - 不要給我
- I don't know anything. - Don't give me...

2034
02:16:41,180 --> 02:16:42,540
天真無邪那一套
the babe-in-the-woods routine.

2035
02:16:42,710 --> 02:16:47,280
我聽過那些電話錄音  你在電話中大談白粉
I've listened to those wiretaps, and I've heard you talk about cocaine.

2036
02:16:47,450 --> 02:16:50,650
你跟亨利一通電話接著一通
Conversation after conversation you talked to Henry on the phone.

2037
02:16:55,930 --> 02:16:57,950
不管他是進監牢
It doesn't matter. Whether he goes to jail...

2038
02:16:58,130 --> 02:17:01,430
還是勝訴了  他都一樣是沒命
or stays on the streets and beats the case, he's a dead man.

2039
02:17:02,170 --> 02:17:03,900
你們心裏都很清楚
He knows it and you know it.

2040
02:17:05,540 --> 02:17:07,160
我們的孩子怎麼辦  他們要上學呀
What about the kids and school?

2041
02:17:07,340 --> 02:17:09,600
總不能把他們留下
Will they get left back? I mean, what goes on?

2042
02:17:10,010 --> 02:17:12,500
你們為什麼不到華爾街去抓那些真正的壞人
Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.

2043
02:17:12,880 --> 02:17:15,440
賣西裝給你們的人  真有幽默感
Whoever sold you those suits had a sense of humor.

2044
02:17:15,610 --> 02:17:18,450
歸根結底  和我們配合才是唯一救你們的方法
What it comes down to is we're your only salvation.

2045
02:17:19,150 --> 02:17:22,590
我們會保障你們的生命  也會不讓他去坐牢
We'll save your life and his life, and we'll keep you out of jail.

2046
02:17:26,820 --> 02:17:29,660
今天早上你曾把你的背景向陪審團說明
This morning you told the jury about your background.

2047
02:17:29,830 --> 02:17:31,660
要從人群中消失並不是一件困難的事
It was easy for us to disappear.

2048
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,120
房子是岳母的名字
My house was in my mother-in-law's name.

2049
02:17:34,300 --> 02:17:36,270
車是我老婆的名字
My cars were registered to my wife.

2050
02:17:36,430 --> 02:17:39,870
社會福利卡以及駕照都是假的
My Social Security cards and driver's licenses were phonies.

2051
02:17:40,040 --> 02:17:42,400
沒投過票  沒繳過稅
I never voted or paid taxes.

2052
02:17:42,970 --> 02:17:47,430
唯一能表示有我這個人存在的是出生證明和犯罪記錄
My birth certificate and arrest sheet was all you'd ever have to know I was alive.

2053
02:17:47,610 --> 02:17:50,140
- 那個人在法庭內嗎  - 是的
- Do you see him here in this courtroom? - Yes.

2054
02:17:50,580 --> 02:17:52,880
你能為陪審團將他指證出來嗎
Will you please point him out for the jury?

2055
02:17:55,590 --> 02:18:00,180
法官大人  請記錄下來  希爾先生已正式指證了詹姆斯·康威
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill identified the defendant, James Conway.

2056
02:18:01,330 --> 02:18:04,420
你也認識一位叫保羅·西席羅的人
Do you also know a man named Paul Cicero?

2057
02:18:04,760 --> 02:18:06,750
- 那個人在這個法庭內嗎  - 是的
- Do you see him in the courtroom? - Yes.

2058
02:18:07,330 --> 02:18:09,230
你能為陪審團將他指證出來嗎
Can you point him out for the jury?

2059
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:15,330
法官大人  請記錄下希爾先生已指證了保羅·西席羅
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill identified the defendant, Paul Cicero.

2060
02:18:16,640 --> 02:18:18,340
法官大人  我這裏有一份文件
Your Honor, I have a document...

2061
02:18:18,510 --> 02:18:20,910
對我來說  最困難的就是從那種生活方式中走出來
The hardest thing was leaving the life.

2062
02:18:21,680 --> 02:18:23,200
我還是喜愛那種生活
I still love the life.

2063
02:18:23,610 --> 02:18:25,710
我們像電影明星一樣被禮遇
We were treated like movie stars with muscle.

2064
02:18:25,880 --> 02:18:27,940
只要開口  要什麼有什麼
We had it all, just for the asking.

2065
02:18:28,120 --> 02:18:31,450
老婆  母親  孩子  人人都能享受
Our wives, mothers, kids, everybody rode along.

2066
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:34,920
一包紙袋的珠寶藏在廚房
I had paper bags filled with jewelry stashed in the kitchen.

2067
02:18:35,090 --> 02:18:37,360
一缸白粉就放在床邊
I had a sugar bowl full of coke next to the bed.

2068
02:18:37,530 --> 02:18:41,330
稱為鼠輩  是因為老鼠為了求生存  什麼事都會做
People call them rats because rats do anything to survive. Isn't that right?

2069
02:18:41,500 --> 02:18:43,520
- 抗議  - 抗議成立
- Objection! - Objection sustained.

2070
02:18:43,700 --> 02:18:46,900
- 至於老鼠我就不知道了  - 你太瞭解了
- I know nothing about being a rat. - You know everything about it.

2071
02:18:49,110 --> 02:18:51,600
只要一通電話  什麼都有
Anything I wanted was a phone call away.

2072
02:18:51,780 --> 02:18:55,210
免費的汽車  城裏所有的黑幫分子玩樂的地方都能自由進出
Free cars. Keys to a dozen hideout flats all over the city.

2073
02:18:55,380 --> 02:18:57,870
一個週末可以下注兩三萬
I'd bet $20,000, $30,000 over a weekend...

2074
02:18:58,050 --> 02:19:02,210
也可以一周內把贏的錢全花光  有時候也借高利貸來還賭債
then blow the winnings in a week or go to the sharks to pay the bookies.

2075
02:19:02,390 --> 02:19:03,440
不過一點關係都沒有
It didn't matter.

2076
02:19:04,150 --> 02:19:09,020
錢花光了  我只要出去多搶一點就行了
It didn't mean anything. When I was broke I would go out and rob some more.

2077
02:19:09,430 --> 02:19:10,830
我們控制一切
We ran everything.

2078
02:19:11,360 --> 02:19:15,630
收買條子  收買律師  甚至收買法官
We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers. We paid off judges.

2079
02:19:15,900 --> 02:19:19,340
每個人都受賄  只要我們肯出錢
Everybody had their hands out. Everything was for the taking.

2080
02:19:21,440 --> 02:19:22,930
現在都結束了
And now it's all over.

2081
02:19:23,870 --> 02:19:25,310
難就難在這裏
That's the hardest part.

2082
02:19:26,340 --> 02:19:27,940
如今一切都不同了
Today everything is different.

2083
02:19:28,110 --> 02:19:32,280
我得像其他人一樣等排班
There's no action. I have to wait around like everyone else.

2084
02:19:32,680 --> 02:19:34,450
連像樣的菜都吃不到
Can't even get decent food.

2085
02:19:35,220 --> 02:19:38,350
我搬來以後曾點過意大利面  加意大利蕃茄配料
After I got here I ordered spaghetti with marinara sauce...

2086
02:19:38,520 --> 02:19:40,320
結果上的是雞蛋面加蕃茄醬
and I got egg noodles and ketchup.

2087
02:19:41,190 --> 02:19:42,680
我成為了無名小卒淡泊一生
I'm an average nobody.

2088
02:19:44,060 --> 02:19:46,830
下半輩子得過得像個可憐蟲
I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook.

2089
02:19:57,840 --> 02:20:06,100
亨利·希爾目前仍在接受證人保護行動
他於1987年在西雅圖以販毒罪名被捕
但得到緩刑五年  此後不曾再犯罪

2090
02:20:07,380 --> 02:20:13,060
1989年  亨利與凱倫在婚後25年正式離婚

2091
