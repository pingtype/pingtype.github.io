00:01:03,923 --> 00:01:05,134
喂
Hey.

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,759
不會有事的
It's going to be okay.

3
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,117
只要告訴我 我們做的是正確的事
Just tell me we're doing the right thing.

4
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,031
不 親愛的 我知道你想去修補
No, sweetheart, I know you want to fix this.

5
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,395
這是你的本行 可我們盡力了
It's what you do. But we've tried.

6
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,872
好嗎 我們盡力了 可看看結果是什麼
All right? We've been trying and look where it's gotten us.

7
00:01:22,603 --> 00:01:24,958
我覺得分開一段時間對他有好處
And I think the space is gonna be good for him.

8
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,230
對我們都好 而且 這是所好學校
For all of us. Besides, it's a good school.

9
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,656
等夏天一過他就回家了
He'll be home by the end of the summer.

10
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,829
是啊
Yeah.

11
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,031
我不會有事的 我保證
I'll be okay. I promise.

12
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,472
我保證
I promise.

13
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,189
我愛你
Love you.

14
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,633
我也愛你
Love you, too.

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,657
給我打電話
Call me.

我愛你
I love you.

18
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,595
哇
Wow.

19
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,840
好樣的 史蒂芬
Well done, Stephen.

20
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,752
太棒了
Amazing!

21
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,436
住手 媽媽
Oh, stop, Mom!

22
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,984
那是什麼 那是什麼
What's that? What's that?

23
00:03:09,008 --> 00:03:09,890
什麼
Huh? Oh!

24
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,033
一 二 三
One, two, three!

25
00:03:14,332 --> 00:03:15,072
漂亮
Nice.

26
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:15,821
耶
Yeah!

27
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:18,028
它基本死了
He's pretty dead.

28
00:03:18,127 --> 00:03:19,446
它死定了
He's very dead.

29
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,909
今天 我兒子成了大人
Today my son has become a man.

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,513
為此
Because of that...

31
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,976
我知道你覺得 我們這麼做是為了懲罰你
I know you think we're probably doing this to punish you,

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
可我們不是
but we're not.

33
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,195
好嗎
All right?

34
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,320
我和你媽是為你好
Your mother and I want the best for you.

35
00:03:44,372 --> 00:03:45,885
你根本不知道她想要什麼
You have no idea what she wants.

36
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,120
我不知道你為何這麼做
I don't know why you're doing this.

37
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,668
是你被學校開除的
I'm not the one that got expelled, pal.

38
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,400
她不想趕走我 是你想
Well, she doesn't want me gone. It's you.

39
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,595
不是的 史蒂芬
That's not true, Stephen.

40
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,856
就是的 你要把我送走
Yes, it is. You're sending me away.

41
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,915
不是的 史蒂芬
It's not true, Stephen.

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,752
我和你媽經過長時間的商量
Your mother and I had a long conversation...

43
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:06,378
商量什麼
About what?

44
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:07,428
我們需要緩一緩
We need a break, Stephen!

45
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,456
我不想緩一緩
I don't want a break! All right?

46
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,152
閉嘴 我恨你
Both of us, okay? Shut up! I hate you!

47
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:11,115
你冷靜
Just calm down. Calm down!

48
00:04:11,131 --> 00:04:12,201
不別碰我
No, don't touch me!

49
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,100
別碰我
Don't touch me!

50
00:04:13,115 --> 00:04:13,762
你冷靜
You just calm down!

51
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,437
別碰我
Don't touch me!

52
00:04:14,448 --> 00:04:15,084
冷靜
Calm down!

53
00:04:22,718 --> 00:04:27,562
譯名: 禁閉 / 冰鎮房嚇(港) / 育陰房(台)

54
00:05:33,955 --> 00:05:34,990
醒醒 醒醒
Wakey, wakey.

55
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,078
起床了
Rise and shine.

56
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,199
你準備好鍛煉了嗎
You ready for your workout?

57
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,232
張開嘴
Open.

58
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,511
很可能整個新英格蘭地區的暴雪
...significant snowfall likely across all of New England,

59
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,640
總之就是這樣
when all is said and done.

60
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,477
隨著暴風雪的臨近
So, as the storm approaches,

61
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,154
你要確定採取了必要的預防措施
you'll want to make sure you take the necessary precautions here

62
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,232
準備好你的所在地會有重大降雪
and plan on some very heavy snow in your area for much of...

63
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,152
輪到你了
It's your turn.

64
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,473
要不要試試看
How about a quick try?

65
00:08:34,103 --> 00:08:35,138
好樣的
Great job.

66
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,954
嗨
Hey.

67
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,513
我想繼續再給他治療幾周
So I'd like to continue working with him for another couple weeks.

68
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,117
這不是我的決定
It's not my decision.

69
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,509
他們要送他去波士頓
They're moving him to Boston.

70
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,225
一個聾啞兒童的福利院
Some group home for deaf kids.

71
00:09:24,354 --> 00:09:25,946
可我們在取得進步
But we're making progress.

72
00:09:25,957 --> 00:09:27,709
這些事需要時間
These things take time.

73
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,869
他是個好孩子 我們可以
He's a great kid, we can...

74
00:09:28,911 --> 00:09:32,360
他上周又打斷了一個孩子的胳膊
He broke another kid's arm last week.

75
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,958
他不能留在斯威策
He can't stay at Sweetser.

76
00:09:34,384 --> 00:09:36,136
我很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

77
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,989
我們要走了
We're leaving.

78
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,560
瓊
Joan!

79
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,192
等一下
Wait a second.

80
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,416
我覺得就像
I guess it was like a...

81
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,954
我覺得就像所有聰明人的證書
I guess it was like certificates for all the smart people,

82
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,160
所以我基本什麼都沒
so basically I have nothing.

83
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,873
我 我沒有
I... I did not...

84
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,040
我想送給你
I want you to have these.

85
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,551
別凍著 好嗎
Keep warm, okay?

86
00:11:18,289 --> 00:11:20,999
你不可能照顧緬因州所有的孩子瑪麗
Well, you can't take care of every kid in Maine, Mary.

87
00:11:24,062 --> 00:11:25,673
我知道
I know.

88
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
呃
Um...

89
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,349
沒人會因為你需要幫助而瞧不起你
No one would judge you for needing help.

90
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,639
謝謝
Thanks.

91
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,198
嗨 威爾森醫生
Hi, Dr. Wilson.

92
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,237
你怎麼樣 還好嗎
How are you? How's it all going?

93
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,072
漫長的一天
Long day.

94
00:12:09,241 --> 00:12:10,469
漫長的一周
Long week.

95
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,453
蒂芬一直讓你分不開身 是不是
Well, Stephen really keeps you on your toes, doesn't he?

96
00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:15,010
他還好嗎
How's he doing?

97
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,157
我收到了文件
I received the papers.

98
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,069
我要把他送到卡文頓
I'm moving him to Covington.

99
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,311
在身體上 我能照顧他
Physically, I can manage.

100
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,839
基本沒問題
Just about,

101
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,998
但這不是他
but it's not him.

102
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,072
只是個我餵飯 擦洗 穿衣的一具肉體
It's just a body that I feed, and wash, and clothe.

103
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,958
在我失去理查德的那一天 我也失去了他
I lost him that day I lost Richard in the car.

104
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,675
瑪麗 身為心理醫生 不等於就是好父母
Mary, being a psychologist doesn't make you a perfect parent.

105
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,028
沒這樣的事
There's no such thing.

106
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,509
你做了你認為是正確的
You did what you thought was right.

107
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,511
我把他送走了
I sent him away.

108
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,793
我把兒子送走了 現在他沒了
I sent my son away and now he's gone.

109
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,473
媽媽會給你買一隻模仿鳥
Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird

110
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,396
如果這只模仿鳥不唱歌
And if that mockingbird don't sing

111

117
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,910
我家裏好像進來了人
I think there is an intruder in my house.

118
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,718
好 別掛電話
Okay, stay on the line.

119

120
00:18:42,192 --> 00:18:43,192
能聽到我嗎
Can you hear me?

121
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,341
波特曼夫人你還在嗎
Mrs. Portman, are you still there?

122

I'm sorry, my mistake.

124
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,357
只是一隻浣熊
It's just a raccoon.

125
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,230
給 喝了能暖和

對不起 我知道現在很晚了
I'm sorry, I know it's late.

How did he even get here? It's 15 degrees out.

131
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,758

138

我願意承擔這個風險

You sure I can't get you another before you head back out, Joe?

147
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,152
謝謝你 瑪麗 我要抓緊時間
Thanks, Mary. I'm gonna press on,

148
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,310
開始挨家挨戶打聽
start going door to door.

149
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,517
這種低溫 一個小孩子在外面不會活很久
A young kid out alone won't survive long in these temperatures.

150
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,200
在他們的公司網站上
...though on their company website

151
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,068
銷售額和轉化率要高得多
have much higher sales numbers and conversion rates.

152
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,918
我感覺很無助
I just feel so helpless.

153
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,115
是啊 我
Yeah, I...

154
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,952
我一下午都在外面找他
I've been out all afternoon looking for him myself.

155
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,552
天啊 瓊
Oh, God, Joan.

156
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,913
不敢想像他一個人在外面會是什麼樣子
I can't stand to think of him out there on his own.

157
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,117
好 呃
Yeah, okay, um...

158
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,832
向我保證一有消息就給我打電話
Well, just promise me you'll call as soon as you hear anything.

159
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,029
好
Okay.

160
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,509
好的
Great.

161
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,113
好 再見
Okay. Bye.

162
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,794
湯姆
Tom!

163
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,229
瑪麗
Mary?

164
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,754
親愛的
Hon?

165
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,113
你沒聽到我嗎 我很擔心
Didn't you hear me? I was worried.

166
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,393
你在這兒幹什麼
What are you doing in here?

167
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,954
我 我剛才
I, uh... I was just...

168
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,751
我想收拾一下史蒂文的床 萬一
I thought I'd make up Stephen's bed in case...

169
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,152
萬一湯姆回來
In case Tom came back.

170
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,434
哦
Oh.

171
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,033
現在幾點了
What time is it?

172
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,547
很晚了
It's late.

173
00:25:50,706 --> 00:25:53,698
亞倫·哈特正在辦公室等你
Aaron Hart is waiting for you in the office.

174
00:25:54,148 --> 00:25:57,618
這孩子一直都在不停的
I mean, the kid's been bouncing around foster homes

175
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:01,211
換領養家庭 那時沒人關心
for, like, half his life, but no one gave a shit then.

176
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,876
現在全鎮人都
And now suddenly the whole town's

177
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,115
突然開始關心了
decided it's time to give a shit.

178
00:26:07,197 --> 00:26:09,028
你知道光是美國 每年就有
Do you know how many children run away

179
00:26:09,071 --> 00:26:12,620
多少孩子離家出走或失蹤嗎
or go missing every year in the United States alone?

180
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,113
我不知道
I don't know.

181
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,428
你看不出這有多荒唐嗎
Don't you see how fucked up that is?

182
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,310
而且 這孩子死了 人人都知道
Besides, the kid's dead. Everyone knows it.

183
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,274
好的 亞倫 今天就談到這裏吧
Okay, Aaron, that's about all we have time for today.

184
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,839
隨便 好的
Whatever, sure.

185
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,914
非常感謝
Thanks a lot.

186
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,193
你爸爸要來接你嗎
Is your dad coming to get you?

187
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,826
嗯
Uh-huh.

188
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,193
青少年啊
Teenagers, huh?

189
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:09,741
怎麼樣
How's it going?

190
00:27:09,803 --> 00:27:12,843
他今天恨我更多 還是恨世界更多
Does he hate me more or less than he hates the rest of the world today?

191
00:27:13,428 --> 00:27:18,443
沒有 他只是不適應你們的搬家和離婚
No, he's just having a rough time with the move and the divorce.

192
00:27:20,537 --> 00:27:22,725
有時我已經記不起他幾年前
Sometimes it's hard to remember he was just a cute little kid

193
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:24,350
還是個可愛的孩子
who liked to throw a ball

194
00:27:24,373 --> 00:27:26,276
喜歡和爸爸一起打棒球
around with his dad a few years ago.

195
00:27:26,556 --> 00:27:27,959
他現在一直很暴躁
He's so angry all the time.

196
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,474
他會過去的
He'll get through it.

197
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,516
只是個困難的年齡段
It's just a difficult age.

198
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,033
你聽過要來暴風雪了嗎
You hear about this storm coming in?

199
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,155
是的
Yeah.

200
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,376
如果演變成冰暴
If it turns into an ice storm,

201
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,536
可能會停電幾天
we could be without power for at least a couple of days.

202
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,595
嗯
Mmm.

203
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,659
你不能獨自在這裏
You probably shouldn't be up here all alone.

204
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,277
我和亞倫打算去鎮上的旅館
Aaron and I are thinking of moving into

205
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,277
住幾天等暴風雪過去
one of the hotels in town to ride it out.

206
00:27:48,907 --> 00:27:49,688
呃
Uh...

207
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,666
如果你也去 也許我可以請你吃個飯
If we do, maybe I could take you for dinner.

208
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:54,629
我不會有事的 我們不會有事的
I'll be fine. We'll be fine.

209
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,757
我兒子病了 我不能帶他走動
My son, he's sick, so I can't really move him.

210
00:27:58,146 --> 00:27:59,864
哦 我很遺憾
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

211
00:27:59,962 --> 00:28:02,237
我還不知道你有個兒子 他多大了
I didn't even know you had a son. How old is he?

212
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:04,376
他18歲 史蒂文18歲
He's 18. Stephen's 18.

213
00:28:04,622 --> 00:28:06,260
他是我的繼子
He's my stepson.

214
00:28:06,366 --> 00:28:07,845
我還不知道
I didn't know that...

215
00:28:08,073 --> 00:28:10,029
我丈夫過世了
My husband passed away, actually,

216
00:28:10,094 --> 00:28:12,005
所以現在只有我和史蒂芬
so it's just Stephen and me now.

217
00:28:12,614 --> 00:28:14,730
也許我們四人哪天可以一起吃個飯
Well, maybe the four of us can get dinner one day.

218
00:28:14,741 --> 00:28:16,538
我們和兩個暴躁的青少年
You know, you, me and our angry teenagers.

219
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:18,351
這不合適
Look, it's not really appropriate.

220
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,389
亞倫是我的病人
Aaron's my patient, so...

221
00:28:20,434 --> 00:28:22,789
而且他還在車上等你
And he's waiting for you in the car.

222
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:23,985
好的
Sure, okay.

223
00:28:24,304 --> 00:28:25,373
呃
Uh, um...

224
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,357
聽著 謝謝你
Well, listen, thanks.

225
00:28:28,471 --> 00:28:29,665
對不起 我
Sorry, I just...

226
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,559
希望你兒子能好轉
I hope your son feels better.

227
00:28:32,687 --> 00:28:34,166
謝謝
Thanks.

228
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,478
天
Shit.

229
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,316
該死
Oh, shit.

230
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,919
沒事的
It's okay.

231
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,750
我感覺我要瘋了
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

232
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,989
瑪麗 冷靜
Mary, calm down.

233
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,991
聽聽你的話
Look, listen to what you're saying.

234
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,236
我當時在 是真實的
I was there. It was real.

235
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,435
你是個理性 的成年人
You're a rational adult.

236
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,316
世上並沒有鬼你是知道的
There's no such things as ghosts, and you know that.

237
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,873
天啊
Oh, God.

238
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,079
我覺得你經歷的是深眠狀態
I think that you experienced something known as parasomnia.

239
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,873
一種能引發夜驚的睡眠失調
A sleep disorder that can trigger night terrors.

240
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,715
可我看到了他 我看到了湯姆
I... But I saw him. I saw Tom.

241
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,589
人人都說他死了
Everybody's been saying he's dead,

242
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,195
我一直希望這不是真的 但這肯定是真的
and I kept wanting it not to be true, but it must be.

243
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,114
我覺得考慮到你受到的壓力
I think that with the amount of stress you're under

244
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,312
以及你已經有的睡眠失調
and the existence of disturbed sleep already,

245
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,674
這完全說得通
it makes complete sense.

246
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,149
說實話
And frankly,

247
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,635
你看到出走的孩子也能解釋
you know, the fact that you saw the runaway boy also tracks.

248
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,234
你一直在找他
You know, you've been looking for him,

249
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,918
你擔心他
you're worried about him.

250
00:32:33,204 --> 00:32:34,782
這不意味著他死了
Does not mean he's dead,

251
00:32:34,949 --> 00:32:36,615
更不用說變成鬼糾纏你
let alone haunting you.

252
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,430
你覺得你夢裏那孩子的腳步聲
Do you think that the sound of the child's footsteps

253
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,909
是不是因為你想起
in your dream could be a reminder of the child that

254
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,637
你失去的兒子
you might think you've actually lost?

255
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,315
讓你想起以前
You know, of the son that

256
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,078
你兒子害怕時就來你房裏
used to come into your room at night when he was scared.

257
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,634
你覺得你夢裏
Do you think that that voiceless child

258
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,230
那個不說話的孩子 既可能是湯姆
in your dream could be Stephen...

259
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,755
也可能是湯姆
...as much as it's Tom?

260
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,788
在車禍之前很長時間
Long before the accident,

261
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,606
我記得你就跟我說過
I remember you telling me that

262
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,312
你感覺在失去史蒂芬
you were feeling like you were losing Stephen.

263
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,998
在失去你的兒子
That you were losing your little boy.

264
00:33:15,635 --> 00:33:16,909
你還記得嗎
Do you remember that?

265
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,028
嗯
Mmm-hmm.

266
00:33:18,601 --> 00:33:20,512
我經歷了很多不幸
I had been through so much.

267
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,438
是啊 跟我說說那個史蒂芬
Yeah. Well, tell me about that Stephen.

268
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,196
車禍之前的史蒂芬
You know, Stephen before the accident.

269
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,874
甚至是他出現行為問題之前
Before the behavioral problems even.

270
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,633
有件事我從沒告訴你 那天早上
I never told you this, but that morning,

271
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,788
他求我別把他送走
he begged me not to send him away.

272
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:44,133
繼續
Go on.

273
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,274
史蒂芬一直怪在理查德身上
Stephen always blamed Richard.

274
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,033
不過是我找到了那所學校
But I was the one who found the school.

275
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,183
我不知道
I just didn't know

276
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,872
怎麼同時兼任他的心理醫生和母親
how to be his therapist and his mother.

277
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,639
瑪麗
Mary?

278
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,635
瑪麗
Mary?

279
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,798
關於湯姆的噩夢
Look, the nightmare about Tom

280
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,388
可能是關於史蒂文的
may be about Stephen,

281
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,756
但這是因為一切都是關於史蒂
but that's because everything's about Stephen.

282
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,816
我想跟你談談
Look, I'd like to talk to you about prescribing

283
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,239
開點藥來調和你的睡眠
something to regulate your sleep, okay?

284
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,799
所以我要做個血液檢查
So I'm gonna need some blood work.

285
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,112
在此期間 你照顧好自己
In the meantime, take care of yourself.

286
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,519
謝謝
Thanks.

287
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,151
開始襲擊人類
...starts to attack humans

288
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,316
即使我們不是它們的天然獵物
when we're not their natural prey.

289
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,797
科學家們能找出辦法防止這樣的悲劇嗎
And can scientists find a way to prevent these tragic events?

290
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,550
嗨 對不起 我剛才 請進
Hi. Sorry, I was, uh... Come in.

291
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,795
這種鯊魚是海洋中最非凡的魚類
This shark is the most charismatic fish in the ocean.

292
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,633
大白鯊體重可以超過4-5000磅
White sharks can weigh in excess of 4 or 5,000 pounds.

293
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,118
體長超過20英尺
Get in excess of 20 feet long.

294
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:20,032
所以 這是一種很大的魚
So, that's a very big fish.

295
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,910
我們知道 這些鯊魚可以活到
We know that these sharks can live...

296
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,271
今天要為這位年輕人做什麼
So, what are we doing for this young man today, then?

297
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,193
不是為我
Actually, it's for me.

298
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,510
我要做個血液檢查
I just need some blood work done.

299
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,229
生什麼病了
What's wrong with you?

300
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,753
沒什麼 我沒事
Nothing, I'm fine.

301
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,559
那你為什麼沒去醫生那裏檢查
Then why haven't you taken yourself to the doctor?

302
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,995
我不想留下他一個人
I don't like to leave him alone.

303
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,798
我盡量少離開家
I try not to leave the house too much.

304
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,038
帥氣的男孩
Handsome boy.

305
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,423
他的眼睛像你
He's got your eyes.

306
00:35:53,513 --> 00:35:55,590
他不
He's not...

307
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,908
謝謝
Thank you.

308
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,511
你一個人照顧他
You take care of him on your own?

309
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,238
嗯
Mmm-hmm. Hmm.

310
00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:08,496
他看起來很好強壯
He looks good. Strong.

311
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:11,715
你肯定照顧得很好
You must be doing something right.

312
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,833
你這個年齡的女人 血壓不該這麼高
Blood pressure is too high for a woman your age.

313
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,232
我們能不能只是
Could we just, um...

314
00:36:28,495 --> 00:36:29,894
是我多管閒事了
None of my beeswax.

315
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,091
我來
I get it.

316
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,512
你等著就是了
You just wait.

317
00:36:34,874 --> 00:36:36,477
醫生拿到血檢結果之後
The doctor will tell you the same thing

318
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:37,852
也會對你這麼說的
when he gets the results.

319
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,874
你什麼時候送史蒂芬去
So, when are you taking Stephen in?

320
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,474
月底
End of the month.

321
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,991
威爾森醫生說我該開始練習離家了
Dr. Wilson says I need to start practicing leaving the nest.

322
00:36:51,229 --> 00:36:53,379
這不算離家吧
I'm not really sure this counts.

323
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,072
昨天我在鎮上看到道格·哈特了
I saw Doug Hart in town yesterday.

324
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,310
天啊 我那天對他很不客氣
Oh, my God, I was so rude to him.

325
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,633
有意思
Funny.

326
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,153
他還覺得惹你生氣了
He thought he'd offended you.

327
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,236
你該給他打電話
You should call him.

328
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,634
跟他約會
Ask him out.

329
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,199
也許我只是打電話跟他道個歉
Maybe I should call him just to apologize.

330
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,515
是啊 道歉
Yeah, to apologize.

331
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,035
那天我很不應該
I felt like such an ass the other day.

332
00:37:22,215 --> 00:37:23,853
我不知情
I had no idea.

333
00:37:23,995 --> 00:37:25,840
露西把情況都跟我說了
Lucy explained everything to me.

334
00:37:25,851 --> 00:37:27,523
她肯定的
Oh, of course she did.

335
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,033
你一個人照顧他肯定很艱難
That must have been hard, taking care of him by yourself.

336
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,632
這也是她跟你說的
She told you about that, too?

337
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,312
是的 史蒂芬
And yes, Stephen...

338
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,390
我要把他送到一個護理中心
I'm moving him to a care home.

339
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,468
對不起 我不知道 她沒告訴我這個
Oh, I'm sorry, I had no idea. She didn't tell me that.

340
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,994
我以為
I thought...

341
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,274
對不起 我
I'm sorry. I...

342
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,236
我都不會說話了
You know, I... This is hard. I haven't...

343
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,189
很久沒跟男人一起吃飯了
I haven't done this in a while.

344
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,640
車禍之前你們很親近
Were you guys close before the accident?

345
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,874
非常親近
Very.

346
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,799
我和理查德結婚時他五歲
He was five when Richard and I got married.

347
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,878
他對我比對他爸爸更親近
He was closer to me than his dad.

348
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,951
但後來他到了青春期
But then he hit puberty,

349
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,435
就像家裏有了個陌生人
and it was like I had a stranger in the house.

350
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,471
我家的亞倫也是
Yeah, Aaron, too. I'm just like,

351
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,517
就像完全換了個人
he's a completely different species.

352
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,149
亞倫是個好孩子
Aaron is a good kid.

353
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,117
他的老師們不這麼認為
Well, his teachers disagree.

354
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,034
我上周去見了校長
I had a meeting with the principal last week.

355
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,759
黑斯廷斯校長 他很差勁
Principal Hastings? He's the worst!

356
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,679
史蒂文也在那裏上過學
So, Stephen went there, too.

357
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,318
但後來被開除了
Until he was expelled.

358
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,078
不會吧 為什麼
No! What for?

359
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,396
是學校小題大做了
Mmm, the whole thing was totally blown out of proportion.

360
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,753
幾個學生在游泳池裏打鬧
There were some kids, and they were messing around in the pool.

361
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,475
他們可能只是戲弄史蒂文
And I guess they were just teasing Stephen.

362
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,273
有一天他報復了但沒傷到任何人
One day he retaliated, but no one got hurt.

363
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,916
他生母去世後 他經歷了很多痛苦
After his mom died, he was dealing with a lot of grief.

364
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,948
等他進入青春期 幾乎不跟任何人說話
And by the time he was a teenager, he barely spoke to anyone

365
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,640
只除了我 後來就出了
except me, and then it was, you know...

366
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,986
我感覺亞倫跟任何人都說話 只除了我
I feel like Aaron talks to everyone but me.

367
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:08,275
對我完全不理不睬
He just completely shuts me out.

368
00:39:10,605 --> 00:39:11,605
嗯
Hmm.

369
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:18,435
我想我就不打擾你們休息了
Well, I guess I should let you two get to bed.

370
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,153
不早了
It's getting late.

371
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,634
史蒂芬
Stephen?

372
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,628
史蒂芬
Stephen?

373
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,919
史蒂芬
Stephen?

374
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,604
我說過了 肯定發生了什麼
I told you, something's going on,

375
00:43:36,661 --> 00:43:38,361
不只是我的幻覺
and it's not just in my head.

376
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,393
瑪麗 深呼吸
Mary, take a deep breath

377
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,144
然後想想你說的話
and think about what you're saying.

378
00:43:43,214 --> 00:43:44,871
請聽我說
Please just listen to me.

379
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,496
我以為是個夢 但不是
I thought it was a dream, but it wasn't.

380
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,431
我當時醒著
I was awake and...

381
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,934
是深眠狀態
Well, sleep parasomnia...

382
00:43:50,025 --> 00:43:52,858
不是什麼深眠狀態 好嗎
It's not fucking sleep parasomnia, okay?

383
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,915
拜託 你一定要相信我
Please, you have to believe me.

384
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,037
聽聽你的話 你在談鬼
And listen to what you're saying. You're talking about ghosts!

385
00:44:01,323 --> 00:44:02,392
這不是你
This isn't you.

386
00:44:02,483 --> 00:44:05,202
真是的 難道我不知道這聽起來很荒唐嗎
For God's sake, don't you think I know how this sounds?

387
00:44:06,164 --> 00:44:08,632
肯定發生了什麼  我能證明
Something is happening. I can prove it.

388
00:44:08,684 --> 00:44:12,518
史蒂文的臉上有抓痕
Stephen, he has scratches on his face.

389
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:14,243
你睡眠不足
You are sleep deprived.

390
00:44:14,307 --> 00:44:16,190
頭腦不清
You're confused.

391
00:44:16,288 --> 00:44:17,932
你想搞明白一切
You're struggling to make sense of everything

392
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:20,611
然後得出了一些荒謬的解釋
and latching onto irrational explanations.

393
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:23,727
聽著 也許是你不小心抓了他的臉
Look, maybe you scratched him yourself by accident.

394
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,352
什麼
What?

395
00:44:26,432 --> 00:44:28,229
天啊
Oh, God.

396
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,713
我不知道哪個更糟
I don't know what's worse.

397
00:44:29,752 --> 00:44:33,639
要麼這些都是真事 要麼是我瘋了
Either this really is happening, or I'm losing my mind.

398
00:44:33,735 --> 00:44:35,851
我經常聽到牆裏
I keep hearing these weird noises

399
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,275
和地板下有奇怪的聲音
in the walls and under the floor.

400
00:44:38,367 --> 00:44:41,006
瑪麗 我是來幫你的
Mary, I am here to help.

401
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,469
我會催促他們盡快完成你的血檢
Listen, I'm gonna rush the lab for your blood work,

402
00:44:43,568 --> 00:44:46,721
然後就可以 給你開些抗抑鬱藥
and then I think we should get you straight onto an anti-depressant.

403
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,823
幾小時後我們再聊 好嗎
I'll talk to you in a few hours, okay?

404
00:44:49,059 --> 00:44:50,094
好
Okay.

405
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,160
現在是即時新聞
Now, to some breaking news

406
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,949
關於兒童福利機構幾天前報告的
concerning the young deaf boy reported missing several days ago

407
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,871
失蹤聾啞兒童
by Social Services.

408
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,188
不到一小時前
Within the past hour,

409
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,989
有人在佛羅里達州哈索恩的一個公園
a boy fitting the description of 9-year-old Tom Patterson

410
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,392
看到了和9歲的
has been spotted

411
00:45:15,408 --> 00:45:17,605
湯姆·帕特森特徵相符的男孩
in a park in Hawthorne, Florida.

412
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,989
接到一個當地居民的報警之後
Acting on a call from a local resident,

413
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:24,437
哈索恩警方正在這一地區進行大規模搜索
Hawthorne police are now conducting a wide search of the area.

414
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:28,035
他們懷疑他可能是乘坐長途汽車來這裏
They speculate he may have traveled by Greyhound bus,

415
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,912
但現在還不知道 他具體在哪兒
but as yet are still to determine his exact whereabouts.

416
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,599
稍後是即將到來的 暴風雪的報道
We'll be back after the break with more on the winter storm heading our way.

417
00:45:42,136 --> 00:45:43,566
只有我
Only me!

418
00:45:43,683 --> 00:45:44,648
嗨
Hey!

419
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,190
我知道你說過什麼都不需要 不過
Okay, I know you said that you didn't need anything, but...

420
00:45:50,087 --> 00:45:52,123
我也不是第一次了 露西
It's hardly my first rodeo, Luce.

421
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,600
你今晚真的不和我們一起嗎
Um... Sure you don't want to stay with us tonight?

422
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,238
不 我們沒事
No, we're fine.

423
00:45:58,367 --> 00:46:00,164
我剛才還以為
For a moment there, I thought I was...

424
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,753
你沒事吧
Are you okay?

425
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:06,995
是的 沒什麼
Yeah, it's nothing.

426
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,310
我只是一直沒睡好
I just haven't been sleeping that well.

427
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,709
你真的什麼都不缺了嗎
Um, sure you have everything?

428
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,677
燈籠 毛毯
Lanterns? Blankets?

429
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,954
足夠的木柴
Enough wood?

430
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,354
是的 謝謝你
Yes, thank you.

431
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,919
好 你保重
Okay, take care, all right?

432
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,149
好的 你也是
Yeah, you, too.

433
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,309
好 再見
Yeah. Bye.

434
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,879
再見
Bye.

435
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,593
燈籠
Lanterns...

436
00:48:14,201 --> 00:48:14,975
天啊
Oh, God...

437
00:48:14,986 --> 00:48:15,733
是我
It's just me.

438
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,760
你嚇了我一跳
You scared me.

439
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,798
對不起闖了進來 我敲過門 但沒人應答
Sorry to barge in. I tried knocking, but no one answered.

440
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,711
我沒聽到你的車
I didn't hear your car.

441
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,680
有一輛鏟雪車 擋住了你家的車道
Yeah, that plow just came. Your drive's blocked.

442
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,751
我只能把車停在路邊走了過來
I had to park down the road and walk in.

443
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,435
哦 好的
Oh. Okay.

444
00:48:27,644 --> 00:48:29,184
我來是為了感謝
I just came to say thank you

445
00:48:29,207 --> 00:48:31,365
昨晚的款待 也來看看你還好嗎
for last night and see if you're okay.

446
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,675
我和亞倫在"假日旅館"訂了個房間
Aaron and I did end up getting a suite down at the Holiday Inn,

447
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,456
你們真的不跟我們一起去嗎
so, you're sure you guys don't want to come with us?

448
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,471
不 你太客氣了
No, that's kind of you.

449
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,028
我們經歷過更糟的天氣
We've weathered worse.

450
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,958
我昨晚很開心
I had a great time last night.

451
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,519
我也是
Me, too.

452
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,679
呃
Um...

453
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,435
他們找到了湯姆 我真是無比的欣慰
I can't tell you what a relief it is they found Tom.

454
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,474
那個離家出走的孩子
You know, the runaway kid.

455
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,993
是啊 是啊 佛羅里達州
Yeah, yeah, Florida.

456
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,911
但後來發現不是他
That turned out to be a false alarm.

457
00:49:07,265 --> 00:49:08,664
你沒聽說嗎
You didn't hear?

458
00:49:10,068 --> 00:49:11,387
沒有
No.

459
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,517
相信他會出現的
I mean, I'm sure he's gonna turn up.

460
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,591
可能會在附近的某個鎮上發現他
They'll probably find him two towns over.

461
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,720
越向北就越
...a little bit as you head further up to the north.

462
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,916
不管你怎麼看
No matter how you look at it though,

463
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,036
這都是一次嚴重的冬季風暴
we're talking about a major winter storm...

464
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,235
你不要緊吧
You okay?

465
00:49:28,479 --> 00:49:29,594
呃
Uh...

466
00:49:29,652 --> 00:49:31,292
我還有很多事要做
I have a lot to do.

467
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,319
我就不送你了
You don't mind letting yourself out.

468
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,259
好的
Sure.

469
00:49:46,473 --> 00:49:48,065
道格 我
Doug! I'm...

470
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,869
你好 威爾森醫生 抱歉 我剛才在樓下
Hi, Dr. Wilson. Sorry, I was downstairs.

471
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:52,733
瑪麗
Mary?

472
00:50:52,765 --> 00:50:53,355
是的
Yeah.

473
00:50:53,366 --> 00:50:55,136
我剛拿到了你的血檢結果
I have just gotten your blood work back from the lab.

474
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,160
好
Okay.

475
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,958
說實話 我有些失望
Frankly, I'm a little disappointed.

476
00:50:58,005 --> 00:50:58,666
什麼
What?

477
00:50:58,677 --> 00:51:00,274
如果你告訴我你在自行用藥
If you'd have told me you were self-medicating,

478
00:51:00,285 --> 00:51:02,241
我們就能避免很多誤會了
we could have avoided a lot of confusion here.

479
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,080
鑒於你吃了那麼多藥
It's no wonder you're having so many problems,

480
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,526
難怪你出了那麼多問題
given the amount of pills you're taking.

481
00:51:06,551 --> 00:51:08,269
你什麼意思
What are you talking about?

482
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,193
瑪麗 苯二氮平類藥物不是能隨便吃的
Mary, benzodiazepines are not a class of drugs we mess around with.

483
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,110
我什麼都沒吃
I'm not taking anything.

484
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,431
除了混合用藥有可能會致命之外
Aside from the fact that mixing prescription drugs can be lethal...

485
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,520
混合
Mixing?

486
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:23,354
我只能估計你在吃史蒂芬的藥
I can only assume that you are taking medication from Stephen,

487
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,351
這不光威脅到你的健康
which not only puts your health at risk,

488
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,440
還有他的健康
but his also.

489
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:29,239
我沒聽我說 我不懂你什麼意思
You're not listening to me. I don't know what you're talking about.

490
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,197
我什麼藥都沒吃
I haven't taken anything.

491
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,776
我本來很願意給你開些有助於睡眠的藥
I would have happily prescribed you something to help you sleep.

492
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,936
雖然藥效會溫和一些
It would have been less potent,

493
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,143
但我肯定會的
but of course I would have done it.

494
00:51:36,198 --> 00:51:38,156
你搞錯了 這不是我的血檢結果
You've made a mistake, those are not my results.

495
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,958
對不起 我現在不方便
I'm sorry, I really can't talk right now.

496
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,743
我回頭再聯繫你
I'm gonna have to call you back.

497
00:51:41,821 --> 00:51:43,198
瑪麗
Mary.

498
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,389
瑪麗
Mary!

499
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,651
瑪麗 瑪麗
Mary? Mary?

500
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,039
你撥打的電話無法接通
The number you are trying to call is not reachable.

501
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,235
史蒂芬 史蒂芬
Stephen. Stephen...

502
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,315
不 住手
No! Stop!

503
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,720
安靜 小寶貝
Hush little baby

504
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,673
別說話
Don't say a word

505
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:37,115
媽媽會給你買一隻模仿鳥
Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird

506
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:41,869
如果這只模仿鳥
And if that mockingbird

507
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,590
媽媽會給你買個
Mama's gonna buy you a...

508
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:51,589
別怕 別怕 別怕
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

509
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,274
別怕 我在
Hey. It's okay. I'm here.

510
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,191
不 不 不
No, no, no, no, no, no! No!

511
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,669
別怕 對不起 對不起
It's okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

512
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:02,673
看著我 我是你兒子 史蒂芬
Look. Look at me. It's your son, Stephen.

513
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,310
別怕 我要把它揭下來
It's okay. I'm gonna take this off.

514
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,069
好
Okay.

515
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,074
對不起 好
I'm sorry. Okay.

516
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,959
安靜 不 噓
Hush, no! Shh!

517
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,189
別喊
Don't scream!

518
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:28,276
別怕 喂 喂
It's okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

519
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:31,960
別怕
It's okay.

520
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,838
這是怎麼回事 拜託
What's happening? Please.

521
00:54:35,733 --> 00:54:37,166
我在照顧你
I'm taking care of you,

522
00:54:38,762 --> 00:54:40,718
就像你照顧我
just like you take care of me.

523
00:54:43,139 --> 00:54:44,538
我在做夢嗎
Am I dreaming?

524
00:54:46,694 --> 00:54:48,310
不是
No.

525
00:54:49,084 --> 00:54:50,312
不再是了
Not anymore.

526
00:54:50,357 --> 00:54:52,674
我不明白
I don't understand.

527
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,631
這
Is... And...

528
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,834
車禍一周後
When I woke up in the hospital,

529
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:59,963
當我在醫院醒來
a week after the accident,

530
00:55:00,235 --> 00:55:01,588
你在我身邊
you were by my side,

531
00:55:02,404 --> 00:55:03,996
伺候我的一切
waiting on my every need.

532
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,353
可你不動 你不說話
But you didn't move. You didn't speak.

533
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,873
是的
No.

534
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,997
你們都以為我不能
And you all assumed I couldn't.

535
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,314
我只是不希望這一切結束
I just didn't want it to end.

536
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:24,149
我越是什麼都不干 這事就越輕鬆
And the longer I did nothing, the easier it got.

537
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,995
醫生一直對你說
The doctors kept telling you

538
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,031
現代醫學對大腦的瞭解有多麼少
how little is known about the brain.

539
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,951
我那時不明白
I couldn't understand.

540
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,076
你的大腦掃瞄一直在改善
Your scans kept improving.

541
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,673
你的反射也正常
Your reflexes were normal.

542
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,189
你只是看到了你想看到的
You saw what you wanted to see.

543
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,352
這幾個月我們在一起那麼幸福
These last few months, we've been so happy together.

544
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,158
只有你和我
Just you and me,

545
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,472
直到他來了
until he came here.

546
00:55:48,847 --> 00:55:50,075
湯姆
Tom.

547
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,628
我不能放他走
I couldn't let him go.

548
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,233
他看到了我
He'd seen me.

549
00:55:55,555 --> 00:55:56,474
你殺了他
You killed him.

550
00:55:56,485 --> 00:55:57,771
我是你兒子
I'm your son!

551
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,038
我是你兒子
I'm your son.

552
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,799
你為什麼總是更關心他們
Why did you always pick them over me?

553
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,518
我比不上他們了
I won't compete anymore.

554
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,076
不 沒事的 噓
Hey, no, no. It's okay. Shh.

555
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:14,000
聽著 喂 喂
Hey, look, hey, hey, hey, hey.

556
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,274
沒事的
It's okay.

557
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,553
他不是鬼
He's not a ghost.

558
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,474
他就在樓下
He's downstairs.

559
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,999
我本打算殺了他 可他爬進了管道間裏
I was gonna deal with him, but he climbed into the crawlspace.

560
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,909
到我房間的就是他
That was him in my room.

561
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,155
嗯
Uh-huh.

562
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,672
我以為都過去了
Yeah, I thought it was all over.

563
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,439
但我低估了這藥
But I underestimated these.

564
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,268
他還活著
He's alive.

565
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,079
我把他堵在裏面
I blocked him in.

566
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,554
等著他餓死
I was waiting for him to starve.

567
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,914
他的那個聲音
That sound of him.

568
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,429
他在黑暗中刮擦的聲音
That sound of him scratching around in the dark.

569
00:56:59,484 --> 00:57:01,007
以前在你的茶裏放一粒
You know, one in your tea used

570
00:57:01,027 --> 00:57:02,792
就能讓你安睡一整夜
to put you down all night.

571
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,794
自從他來了之後 我不得不加大了劑量
I had to up the dosage since he's been here.

572
00:57:06,392 --> 00:57:08,781
喂 過來 過來
Hey, come here, come here.

578
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,639

Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

579
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,359
嚥下去
Swallow.

580
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,594
嚥下去
Swallow.

581
00:57:35,425 --> 00:57:36,494
乖
Good girl.

582
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:49,793
等你醒來時 他就不在了
When you wake up, he'll be gone.

583
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,590
我們就能回到正常
We can go back to normal.

584
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,433
只有你和我 我保證
Just you and me. I promise.

585
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,193
喂
Hello?

586
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,350
不別再讓我等
No! No, do not put me on hold again.

587
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:21,792
我需要你們派人去找瑪麗·波特曼
I need you to send someone out to see Mary Portman.

588
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,997
在德爾福路28號
At 28 Delphi Lane.

589
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,348
不 她
No. She...

590
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,590
不 她沒出事故
No, she has not been in an accident.

591
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,989
我覺得她被下藥了
I think she's being drugged.

592
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,791
你已到達目的地
You have reached your destination.

593
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,029
什麼
What?

594
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,953
該死
Shit.

595
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,478
天啊
Oh, God...

596
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,679
安靜
Shut up!

597
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,673
安靜
Shut up!

598
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,878
我以為你會開心
I thought you'd be happy.

599
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,469
現在你不必把我送走了
Now you don't have to send me away.

600
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,195
我只想幫你 史蒂芬

你出了嚴重的車禍
You were in a terrible accident.

602
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:23,754
身體不好
You're not well.

603
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,991
我聽見你說了
I heard you

604
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,828
在昨晚
last night.

605
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,989
你又要把我送走
You're trying to send me away again.

606
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,069
因為他
Because of him!

607
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:41,514
不 不是因為他
No, no, it's not because of him.

608
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,830
你把我的房間給了他
You gave him my room.

609
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,117
你要替換我
You're replacing me!

610
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,192
沒人能取代你
No one could ever replace you.

611
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,554
我保證
I promise.

612
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,669
拜託 把斧子放下
Please, just put the ax down,

613
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,472
我們可以談談

614
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,357
我能解決此事
I can fix this.

615
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,396
我們可以回到以前的樣子
We can go back to how it was.

616
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,440
我還可以請人幫你
And I can get you some help, okay?

617
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,190
拜託 把斧子放下
Please, just put the ax down.

618
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,077
槍裏沒有子彈
It's not loaded.

619
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,394
我這是為了我們
I'm doing this for us!

620
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,348
你沒事吧
Are you okay?

621
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,472

I'm gonna get you out of here.

622
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:38,629
不
No!

623
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,148
快跑
Run!

624
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:53,512
史蒂芬 拜託 住手
Stephen, please, stop!

625
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:57,155
別說了 你要毀了一切
Stop it! Stop it! You're ruining everything.

626
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,320
冷靜
Calm down.

627
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,958
我是在幫你收拾殘局
I am trying to fix your mess.

628
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,991
史蒂芬 這不是你
Stephen, this isn't you.

629
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,118
閉嘴 你閉嘴 你不瞭解我
Shut up. Just shut up. You don't know me.

630
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:08,853
你是個好孩子史蒂芬
You're a good boy, Stephen.

631
01:05:08,864 --> 01:05:09,586
不
No.

632
01:05:09,609 --> 01:05:11,077
只是因為車禍
It was just the accident.

633
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,230
那不是意外車禍
It wasn't an accident!

634
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:17,552
我不在乎自己的死活 只要能撞死他
I didn't care if I died as long as he did.

635
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,320
你是我的一切
You're what I... You...

636
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,711
你要把我送走
You were sending me away.

637
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,829
我必須阻止他

不能讓他帶我離開你
I couldn't let him take me away from you.

我寧願死 也不想離開你
I would rather die than be away from you.

641
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,559
噓
Shh...

642
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,315
我們不需要別人
We don't need anyone else.

643
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,315
天啊 湯姆

650
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,752
安靜 小寶貝
Hush little baby

651
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:18,713
別說話
Don't say a word

652
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:23,356
媽媽會給你買一隻模仿鳥
Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird

653
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:28,791
如果這只模仿年不唱歌

你們都好吧
Everybody okay?

660
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,152
我覺得
I just thought we'd, uh,

661
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,753
在警察來之前我們該聊聊
have a little chat before the police get here.

662
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,239
天啊
Oh, God.

663
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:35,196
我覺得我們沒時間
I don't really think that we have time for...

664
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,958

For games right now, do we?

665

你勸她送走我
You told her to get rid of me.

668
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:03,678
可她愛我
But she loves me.

669
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,634
沒人能分開我們
And no one is gonna keep us apart.

670
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,396
湯姆 沒事 他走了

快 跟我來
Quick, come with me.

679
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,149
等等
Wait...

680
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,437
在這兒等著 等等
Wait here. Wait.

681
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:44,831

Dr. Wilson...

682
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:47,473

He was here...

685
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:58,031
一直都在
The whole time.

686
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,519
真對不起
I'm so sorry.

687
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:02,268
在史蒂芬的腦子裏

不要去反駁他的錯覺
Don't challenge his delusions.

689

You understand?

01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,237
別讓他看到那孩子
Don't let him see the boy.

691

他要的是你 只有你

進入他的錯覺中

You were right, okay?

707
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:36,980
我專注於我的病人
I was focused on my patients,

708
01:17:37,002 --> 01:17:38,535
沒能考慮到你
when I should have been thinking about you.

709
01:17:38,613 --> 01:17:39,967
不已經太晚了
No! No, too late!

712
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:47,829
不明白你這麼做是為了我們
I didn't understand that you were doing it for us.

713
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,069
我不知道
I didn't know.

714
