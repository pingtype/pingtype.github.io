1
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:15,910
從前
Once upon a time.

2
00:01:16,093 --> 00:01:17,344
很久以前
A very long time ago,

3
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:19,263
第一波吸血鬼出現的時候
back when the first vamp showed up,

4
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,598
有一個男人
there was a man.

5
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:21,932
先生
Mister!

6
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:23,642
是的 先生
-Yeah, Mister.

7
00:01:23,809 --> 00:01:27,021
先生是有史以來最強的獵人
Well, Mister was the best hunter that there ever was.

8
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:30,482
他途經刑柱之地 消滅吸血鬼
And he traveled the Stakelands killing vamps.

9
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:34,486
然後有一天 他碰到了一個男孩
And then one day he came upon this boy.

10
00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:36,030
當時那個男孩處境非常危險
He was in real trouble.

11
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:37,715
一隻龐大的壞蛋吸血鬼
You see, there was this big bad vamp

12
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:39,241
就要把他給吃了
that was gonna eat him up!

13
00:01:39,408 --> 00:01:40,159
不要
No.

14
00:01:40,326 --> 00:01:41,493
是啊
Yeah.

15
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,037
但是先生出現了
But Mister showed up

16
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:45,539
他用尖木棍直插 吸血鬼的心臟
and he staked that vamp right through his heart.

17
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,791
耶
Yay!

18
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,293
在那之後
And after that,

19
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,714
他們來到北方他們遇到了一個女孩
they came up north and they met a girl.

20
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,299
是媽咪
' Mommy!

21
00:01:55,466 --> 00:01:57,468
是的 是你媽咪
Yeah, it was mommy.

22
00:01:57,635 --> 00:02:00,804
那個男孩和女孩相愛了
And the boy and this girl they fell in love.

23
00:02:00,971 --> 00:02:04,642
然後你就出現了
And then you came along.

24
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,817
先生後來怎麼樣了
What happened to Mister?

25
00:02:15,277 --> 00:02:18,155
我不知道寶貝
I don't know, baby.

26
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:22,034
有一天 我醒來後 他已經離開了
One day I woke up and he was gone.

27
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:26,121
我發現這條項鏈掛在一輛車的側邊
I found this necklace hanging on the side of a car.

28
00:02:26,288 --> 00:02:28,999
他留下它 這樣我總是能記起他
He left it so that I would always remember him.

29
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,133
他們都死了
They're dead.

30
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,808
你還活著
You're alive.

31
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:47,601
像個活著的樣兒
Act like it.

32
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,561
我馬上回來 寶貝
I'll be right back, baby.

33
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:14,670
要我跟你一起去嗎
Do you want me to go with you?

34
00:03:14,837 --> 00:03:15,963
不這次不行
No, not this time.

35
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,510
你要留在她身邊
I want you to stay with her.

36
00:03:17,641 --> 00:03:18,475
好吧
Okay.

37
00:03:18,518 --> 00:03:19,213
好的
Okay,

38
00:03:19,252 --> 00:03:19,799
再見
bye.

39
00:03:19,854 --> 00:03:20,877
再見
bye.

40
00:03:23,029 --> 00:03:24,063
他們帶了狂暴者來
They got berserkers!

41
00:03:24,082 --> 00:03:25,632
他們會殺死我們所有人的
They're gonna kill us all!

42
00:03:25,662 --> 00:03:26,454
除了我
Not me.

43
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:28,160
所以你跟在我身邊明白嗎
So you stay close, you understand?

44
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:48,954
我想留在這兒
I wanna stay.

45
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:50,914
安靜寶貝 保持安靜
Hush, baby, you just stay quiet.

46
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,002
馬丁
Martin?

47
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:01,216
馬丁
Martin?

48
00:04:50,015 --> 00:04:52,307
放下吧 男孩
Put it away, boy.

49
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:54,353
我們無法改變過去
We don't do history.

50
00:05:07,926 --> 00:05:17,755
譯名: 刑柱之地2/末日血慌(台)

51
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,218
這個世界不是在一聲巨響中死去的
The world didn't die with a bang.

52
00:05:27,803 --> 00:05:29,930
它是在一聲尖叫中死去
It died with a scream.

53
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,808
大量的尖叫聲
Lots of them.

54
00:05:34,852 --> 00:05:36,770
我都聽到了
And I heard 'em all.

55
00:05:41,358 --> 00:05:43,485
什麼也沒剩下
There's nothing left,

56
00:05:44,027 --> 00:05:46,029
一片垂死的景象
but a dying landscape.

57
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,242
很久前 人們就已經停止了重建
People stopped trying to rebuild a long time ago.

58
00:05:51,827 --> 00:05:53,912
我們任其土崩瓦解
We let it all fall apart.

59
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:57,666
現在到處一片死寂
And now everything's quiet.

60
00:05:58,167 --> 00:05:59,877
空蕩
Empty-

61
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:04,298
你在數周內都可能遇不到一個活人
You can go for weeks without finding a soul.

62
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:08,886
日夜更替
The days come and night falls.

63
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:13,015
我們要麼活下來 要麼死去
And we survive or we die.

64
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,060
我們所擁有的只剩回憶
All you really got are your memories

65
00:06:17,227 --> 00:06:20,814
還有明天 前提是你夠幸運
and tomorrow, if you're lucky.

66
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,402
新伊甸是我僅存的家園
New Eden was the only home I had left.

67
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:27,946
而她
And she...

68
00:06:28,113 --> 00:06:29,907
她從我手裏奪走了它
she took it from me.

69
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:33,410
兄弟會稱她為"母親"
The Brotherhood called her "The Mother".

70
00:06:34,453 --> 00:06:36,133
那些吸血鬼崇拜者們
Those vamp worshipers

71
00:06:36,144 --> 00:06:38,383
終於找到了他們的彌賽亞
finally found their Messiah.

72
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,877
那個被派來掃清世界上罪惡的人
The one sent to wipe the earth clean of sin.

73
00:06:43,712 --> 00:06:48,425
（我們都是她的孩子↑）
我向南進入刑柱之地
I was heading south into the Stakelands.

74
00:06:50,219 --> 00:06:52,262
如果他還活著
If he was still alive,

75
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:54,431
那就是我能找到他的地方
that's where I'd find him...

76
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:00,979
先生
Mister,

77
00:07:03,774 --> 00:07:06,818
那個最接近家人的人
closest thing to family I had.

78
00:07:10,989 --> 00:07:13,242
人們都知道他
People knew of him.

79
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:15,452
還有他單槍匹馬和
Of his one-man war against the Brotherhood

80
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:17,371
兄弟會吸血鬼們戰鬥的故
and the vamps.

81
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,248
他是個傳奇
He was a legend.

82
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,960
他是最後一個獵人
He was the last hunter.

83
00:07:25,796 --> 00:07:28,131
如果我想找到那個女吸血鬼
If I wanted to get to her,

84
00:07:28,298 --> 00:07:30,509
我就需要他的幫助
I was gonna need his help.

85
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:22,880
美國邊界線 10公里

86
00:12:47,826 --> 00:12:49,786
放下 箭孩子
Drop it, son.

87
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,251
他們出來的時間早了點
They've been coming out earlier.

88
00:12:56,418 --> 00:12:58,837
冒著見光的風險
Chancing the light...

89
00:12:59,004 --> 00:13:00,797
鋌而走險
getting desperate.

90
00:13:01,423 --> 00:13:03,675
你從哪裏來的
Where are you coming from?

91
00:13:03,842 --> 00:13:07,012
北方 新伊甸來的
Up north. New Eden.

92
00:13:07,178 --> 00:13:09,723
那你現在離家很遠了
You're a long way from home.

93
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,683
你在這裏做什麼
What are you doing here?

94
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,894
我在找人
I'm looking for someone.

95
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,395
都叫他先生
He's called Mister.

96
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,814
是的 聽說過他
Yeah, heard of him...

97
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:20,025
還以為他死了
thought he was dead.

98
00:13:20,442 --> 00:13:22,819
這個可憐的男孩看起來餓了
The poor boy looks hungry.

99
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:24,488
敢不老實的話 孩子
You try anything, son,

100
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:25,916
我會把你切成兩半
I'll cut you in half.

101
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,490
噢 別說了 卡爾
Oh, shush, Karl,

102
00:13:27,657 --> 00:13:30,702
你看不出他是個好男孩嗎
can't you see he's a nice boy?

103
00:13:30,869 --> 00:13:32,120
來吧
Come on.

104
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,247
她不讓你吃飽了是不會罷休的
She won't be satisfied 'till you're fed.

105
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,207
天很快就黑了
Be dark soon anyway.

106
00:13:36,374 --> 00:13:38,585
最好到裏面去
Best get inside.

107
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,112
味道很好 夫人 謝謝您
It's good, ma'am, thank you.

108
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,406
抱歉沒有肉吃
Sorry there's no meat.

109
00:14:08,573 --> 00:14:11,076
現有條件下 我們只能這樣勉強應付了
We gotta make do with what we have.

110
00:14:11,242 --> 00:14:14,537
你們不吃嗎
You uh... you're not eating?

111
00:14:14,704 --> 00:14:16,748
我們吃過了
We ate already.

112
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,505
我們的兒子沃爾特去了加拿大
Our boy Walter went to Canada,

113
00:14:23,672 --> 00:14:26,007
在那裏已經有孩子了
had a child up there,

114
00:14:26,174 --> 00:14:28,843
他從沒回來過
never came back.

115
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,512
也許你知道他
Maybe you know of him?

116
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:32,722
沃爾特·阿姆斯特朗
Walter Armstrong?

117
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:34,391
別這樣 吉恩
Come on, Jean.

118
00:14:34,557 --> 00:14:35,892
都多少年了
It's been years.

119
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:39,104
沃爾特就算沒死也差不多了
Walter is dead or as good as.

120
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:39,938
放棄了希望
Give up hope,

121
00:14:40,105 --> 00:14:42,732
就和坐著等死沒什麼兩樣
you might as well lay down and die.

122
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:44,505
這個男孩在滿目瘡痍的世界中走失了
The boy is lost and alone in a world

123
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,121
孤獨無依
of woe.

124
00:14:46,277 --> 00:14:49,072
但是他正在尋找自己的目標
And yet here he is looking for something.

125
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:51,908
這就是希望
That's hope.

126
00:14:52,075 --> 00:14:54,869
在這種時刻
Times like these...

127
00:14:55,036 --> 00:14:57,914
希望是我們繼續前進的唯一動力
it's all we got to keep us going.

128
00:14:59,874 --> 00:15:02,627
去把沃爾特的床鋪好 卡爾
Make up Walter's bed for him, Karl.

129
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:10,051
謝謝你 夫人
Thank you, ma'am.

130
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,765
壞事發生在好人身上
Bad things happen to good people.

131
00:15:15,932 --> 00:15:18,393
這世界並不公平
World ain't fair.

132
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,271
永遠也不會公平
Never will be.

133
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:25,150
但仍有好的東西可以去尋找
There's good to be found.

134
00:15:32,952 --> 00:15:35,431
157人死於襲擊

135
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:43,478
南部松樹林的襲擊事件

136
00:15:51,843 --> 00:15:54,471
不時有人穿過這裏
People pass through now and again.

137
00:15:54,637 --> 00:15:56,389
我從他們那裏打聽新聞
I get what news they have,

138
00:15:56,556 --> 00:16:00,810
更新我的地圖 寫下他們的故事
update my maps, write down their stories.

139
00:16:00,977 --> 00:16:03,146
什麼
Why?

140
00:16:03,313 --> 00:16:05,440
愛好而已
Just a hobby.

141
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:08,276
誰知道呢 如果這場災難有結束的一天
Who knows, this thing ever ends

142
00:16:08,443 --> 00:16:10,904
也許人們會想知道曾經發生過什麼
people might wanna know what happened.

143
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:20,663
我們活在一個奇怪的時代
Yeah, it's strange times we're living in.

144
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,833
這是新黑暗時代 現在就是這樣
It's the new dark ages, that's what this is.

145
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,463
你沒事吧 孩子
You okay, son?

146
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,215
沒事我只是
Yeah, I just got a...

147

我們按照她的願景建造這個世界

00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:55,610
你們不必再生病 飢餓 勞累
You need not be sick, hungry, tired--

175
00:18:57,487 --> 00:18:59,447
嘿
Hey there.

176
00:18:59,614 --> 00:19:01,908
媽的 哥們 你嚇了我一跳
Shit, man, you scared me.

177
00:19:02,951 --> 00:19:04,661
你從哪裏來的
Where are you coming from?

178
00:19:04,827 --> 00:19:06,579
加拿大
Canada.

179
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,957
鳴額
Hmm.

180
00:19:11,459 --> 00:19:13,294

How's things here?

181
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,675
靜悄悄
Quiet.

182
00:19:22,637 --> 00:19:24,555
你要交易什麼
What you got for trade?

183
00:19:24,722 --> 00:19:27,642
不交易 我只是來找人的
You keep that, I'm just looking for somebody.

184
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:29,310
這裏除了我沒別人
Well, nobody here but me.

185
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:43,574
你在找那個獵人
You you looking for the hunter.

186
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:49,163
你 還有兄弟會那幫人也在找
You and them Brotherhood boys,

187
00:19:50,707 --> 00:19:52,792
哦 他們可不太喜歡他
they don't like him much.

188
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,711
不 先生
No, sir.

189
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:56,963
你呢 你看見他了嗎
What about you? You seen him?

190
00:19:59,882 --> 00:20:02,719
是的 是的
Yeah, yeah, I...

191
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:04,012
是我見過他
Yeah, I seen him.

192
00:20:04,178 --> 00:20:05,638
在哪裏
When?

193
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:11,686
幾個月前
Few months back.

194
00:20:13,938 --> 00:20:15,565
他往哪裏去了
Where was he headed?

195
00:20:15,732 --> 00:20:17,358
封鎖區
Lockdown.

196
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,987
往西走了
West...

197
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:23,364
朝唐納希維爾去了
towards Donnersville.

198
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:25,950
唐納希維爾 在哪裏 我怎麼去那兒
Donnersville, where is that? How do I get there?

199
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:29,329
最快得走71號公路
Quickest way up is 71.

200
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:31,372
經過那個老磚廠
Past the old brick plant.

201
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:33,458
沒問題的
Good folk.

202
00:20:33,624 --> 00:20:36,711
那裏是這附近唯一安全的地方
That's the only safe place around these parts.

203
00:20:36,878 --> 00:20:39,464
好的 明白 非常感謝您的幫助
Alright, well, thank you very much for your help.

204
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,133
後會有期 加拿大
See you around, Canada.

205
00:21:32,576 --> 00:21:33,660
嗨
Hi.

206
00:21:35,686 --> 00:21:37,939
別害怕 寶貝 我不會傷害你
Don't worry, sweetheart, I'm not gonna hurt you.

207
00:21:39,146 --> 00:21:42,358
我叫馬丁 你叫什麼名字
I'm Martin. What's your name?

208
00:21:57,452 --> 00:22:00,705
世界上大部分的善都消失了
Most of the good in the world is gone.

209
00:22:06,936 --> 00:22:08,521
仇恨
Hate...

210
00:22:10,727 --> 00:22:14,314
仇恨似乎是唯一在生長的東西
hate seems to be the only thing that grows anymore.

211
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:23,651
想成為惡魔並不需要尖牙
You don't need fangs to be a monster.

212
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,310
他們比吸血鬼更壞
They're worse than the vamps.

213
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,731
是他們自己選擇了這樣
They chose this.

214
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:24,987
女士們 先生們
Ladies and Gentlemen,

215
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:28,282
盡情欣賞那隻野獸吧
feast your eyes on the Behemoth!

216
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:36,707
但首先 咱們先來個廝殺開胃菜
But first, an appetizer of mayhem.

217
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:41,712
一場沒有規則的死亡之戰
A mano a mano, no-rules death match!

218
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:45,842
現在 有請狂暴者的剋星
And now, The Bane of Berserkers,

219
00:23:46,108 --> 00:23:49,570
暴力總督
The Viceroy of Violence,

220
00:23:49,737 --> 00:23:54,200
無法擊敗的刑柱之主
The undefeated... The Stakelander!

221
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:17,223
先生
Mister?!

222
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,683
先生
Mister.

223
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:21,060
先生 是我
Mister, it's me.

224
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:45,251
是我啊 白癡
Mister, it's me, you fucking idiot!

225
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,604
馬丁
Martin?

226
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,731
是
Yes.

227
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:21,078
不打就得死
Fight or die!

228
00:26:00,357 --> 00:26:01,988
我們走吧
Let's go!

229
00:26:32,295 --> 00:26:32,967
怎麼了
What?

230
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:33,887
退後
Back up.

231
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,743
這是個防範措施
It's a precaution.

232
00:27:07,935 --> 00:27:10,354
是兄弟會幹的嗎
Was it Brotherhood?

233
00:27:18,154 --> 00:27:20,281
是一個女吸血鬼幹的
It was the she-vamp.

234
00:27:27,955 --> 00:27:29,999
她和兄弟會合作
She was working with The Brotherhood.

235
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:32,501
他們伏擊了我們
They ambushed us.

236
00:27:33,461 --> 00:27:35,148
不知從哪兒突然冒出來的
Came out of nowhere.

237
00:27:37,101 --> 00:27:38,478
她和其它的吸血鬼一起
She had other vamps with her...

238
00:27:38,538 --> 00:27:40,118
還有那些狂暴者
Berserkers.

239
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:42,595
他們的組織
And they were organized,

240
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:44,722
像一支軍隊
like an army.

241
00:27:47,808 --> 00:27:50,519
她似乎能控制它們
Like she had some kind of control over them.

242
00:27:51,687 --> 00:27:54,106
我從來沒有見過那樣的事
I've never seen anything like it.

243
00:27:57,485 --> 00:28:00,362
我試圖救她們 但
I tried to save them but...

244
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:21,091
我們能殺她嗎
Can we kill her?

245
00:28:24,053 --> 00:28:26,055
你一生都在面對死亡 孩子
You got your whole life to die, kid,

246
00:28:26,222 --> 00:28:28,057
沒必要趕著去送死
no point in rushing it.

247
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,352
放手吧
Let it go.

248
00:28:32,394 --> 00:28:34,563
我不能
I can't.

249
00:28:34,939 --> 00:28:38,275
男人把生命都用在報仇上
A man who spends his life on revenge...

250
00:28:38,442 --> 00:28:41,070
他可能同時也給自己挖了兩個墳墓
He might as well dig two graves.

251
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:44,448
我確實這樣
I did.

252
00:28:47,034 --> 00:28:49,411
我們給女兒起名貝爾
We named our daughter Belle.

253
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:53,374
你還記得貝爾嗎
Do you remember Belle?

254
00:28:55,042 --> 00:28:57,294
每個人我都記得 孩子
I remember everybody, kid.

255
00:28:58,796 --> 00:29:01,006
他們大多死了
And most of them are dead.

256
00:29:38,712 --> 00:29:39,915
嘿
HEY-

257
00:29:40,548 --> 00:29:43,992
我想一小時後上那條路
I wanna be on the road in about an hour.

258
00:29:44,675 --> 00:29:46,927
我不知道你急什麼 孩子
I don't know what the hurry is, kid.

259
00:29:49,513 --> 00:29:50,639
她怎麼了
What is with her?

260
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:53,767
她是個野孩子
She's feral,

261
00:29:53,934 --> 00:29:56,478
可能是在野外自己長大的
probably raised herself up in the wilds.

262
00:29:56,645 --> 00:29:58,564
我以前見過這樣的
I seen it before.

263
00:30:05,654 --> 00:30:07,364
嘿
Hey.

264
00:30:11,294 --> 00:30:14,630
過來 過來 沒事的
Come here, come here, it's okay.

265
00:30:15,325 --> 00:30:17,285
就是這樣現在
That's it now.

266
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,686
可以了
There you go.

267
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,643
這是音樂 好聽
It's music. It's good.

268
00:30:41,657 --> 00:30:45,161
就是這樣
That's it, yeah.

269
00:30:51,664 --> 00:30:53,499
馬丁 移桌子
Martin, move the table!

270
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,370
進去嗎
In there?!

271
00:31:00,414 --> 00:31:00,983
是的
Yeah.

272
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:02,534
還有武器
Your weapons!

273
00:31:02,553 --> 00:31:03,637
不 進洞去
No, in the hole!

274
00:31:03,804 --> 00:31:05,389
女孩 快快過來
Girl, come on, come on. Move!

275
00:31:05,556 --> 00:31:07,892
下去 下去
Attagirl, down in there! Down in there.

276
00:31:11,562 --> 00:31:13,439
馬丁 給
Martin, here!

277
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,524
不 不 等等
No, no, wait!

278
00:31:15,691 --> 00:31:17,443
等等 你在幹什麼
Wait, what are you doing?

279
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:19,835
他在這裏
He's in here! Get that mother fucker!

280
00:31:26,457 --> 00:31:28,770
兄弟們 姐妹們
Brothers and sisters,

281
00:31:30,898 --> 00:31:33,025
該死的
Goddamn it!

282
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:37,604
不 不 不
No, no. No,no,no.

283
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,273
別擔心先生沒那麼容易死
Don't worry. Mister ain't easy to kill

284
00:31:39,284 --> 00:31:40,526
而且他們沒看到我們
and they haven't see us.

285
00:31:40,576 --> 00:31:42,099
我們會救他回來的
We'll get him back.

286
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,051
走吧
Come on.

287
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,684
噢 糟糕
Oh shit.

288
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,908
你媽個
You motherfucker.

289
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,499
我討厭吸血鬼
I hate vampires.

290
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:07,932
還有其它的嗎
Are there any more?

291
00:35:08,415 --> 00:35:10,417
但願沒有
I hope not.

292
00:35:10,584 --> 00:35:12,294
射得好 孩子
Nice shot, kid.

293
00:35:12,461 --> 00:35:14,880
她把一個尖爪插進我肚子裏了
Ah, she put a claw in me.

294
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,633
我們得把它取出來
Alright, we've got to get it out.

295
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:19,968
不
No, leave it.

296
00:35:20,135 --> 00:35:21,887
它插出了一個洞
It's pluggin' the hole.

297
00:35:22,054 --> 00:35:24,348
是的 但你這樣會流血身亡的
Yeah, but you're gonna bleed to death.

298
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,850
你得幫我燒灼它
You're gonna have to cauterize it.

299
00:35:29,102 --> 00:35:32,272
這兒的北邊有個封鎖區
There's a lockdown north of here.

300
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:34,191
那兒有一個醫生
They got a doc there...

301
00:35:41,615 --> 00:35:44,201
別哭了
Oh, stop your crying,

302
00:35:44,368 --> 00:35:46,662
我還沒死 女人
I ain't dead yet, woman.

303
00:35:48,664 --> 00:35:50,249
我準備好了 孩子
I'm ready, kid.

304
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:52,626
使勁貼上去
Slap iron to it.

305
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,134
去找到他
Find him!

306
00:36:42,884 --> 00:36:45,220
把那個婊子養的異族人帶回來
Bring that heathen son of a bitch back.

307
00:36:45,387 --> 00:36:46,346
是頭兒
Yes, sir.

308
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:50,934
頭兒
Sir!

309
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,921
對不起 母親
I'm sorry, Mother,

310
00:37:21,298 --> 00:37:22,883
他逃跑了
he escaped.

311
00:37:26,618 --> 00:37:28,620
不知道是怎麼回事
I don't know how.

312
00:37:29,489 --> 00:37:31,110
他
He...

313
00:37:31,928 --> 00:37:33,303
有人幫他
he had help.

314
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:39,800
也不會跑遠的
He won't get far.

315
00:37:41,191 --> 00:37:43,902
我 我已經派人去追他了
I've sent men after him...

316
00:37:50,552 --> 00:37:54,014
請接受我最卑微的道歉族母
My humblest apologies, Mother of Our Blood.

317
00:37:56,057 --> 00:37:57,517
請原諒我
Please forgive me.

318
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:22,918
你別管我了 孩子
Go on and leave me here, kid.

319
00:38:23,084 --> 00:38:24,669
我會拖累你的
I'm slowing you down.

320
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:26,379
夠了 閉嘴
Alright, shut up.

321
00:38:26,546 --> 00:38:29,424
我要保護你 爸爸 我哪也不去
I got your back, pappy. I ain't going nowhere.

322
00:38:29,591 --> 00:38:32,552
你爸已經死了
I got your pappy swingin'.

323
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:34,679
我剛在後面不遠處看到一棵柳樹
I saw a willow tree a little ways back.

324
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:35,721
我去砍些樹皮來
I'll try to cut some bark.

325
00:38:35,779 --> 00:38:38,099
那也許會幫你減輕痛苦
Maybe it'll help with your pain. Okay?

326
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:44,689
嘿 女孩
Hey, girl.

327
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:55,492
我叫先生
I'm Mister,

328
00:38:55,659 --> 00:38:57,786
先生
Mister.

329
00:38:57,906 --> 00:39:01,493
你的名字是女士
Your name is Lady.

330
00:39:01,612 --> 00:39:03,197
先生
Mister...

331
00:39:03,872 --> 00:39:05,832
女士
Lady.

332
00:39:07,337 --> 00:39:09,673
你明白嗎
You understand?

333
00:39:16,972 --> 00:39:19,516
這豈不是大走運了
Well, now, isn't this sweet?

334
00:39:19,683 --> 00:39:22,269
敢動一下你就死定了 獵人
You move and you die, Hunter.

335
00:39:22,435 --> 00:39:24,563
你給自己找了個小老婆
I see you got yourself a squaw doggie.

336
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,697
他對你來說有點老了 不是嗎
She's a little old for you, no?

337
00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:34,614
嗚 我還從來沒抓到過小野人
Whoo! I never had a feral brat before!

338
00:39:34,781 --> 00:39:36,491
我賭她會咬人
I bet you she bites.

339
00:39:39,703 --> 00:39:41,162
你個小婊子
You little bitch!

340
00:39:43,357 --> 00:39:45,901
現在你得付出代價
Oh, now you're gonna pay.

341
00:39:54,509 --> 00:39:55,719
把槍放下
Drop it!

342
00:39:57,957 --> 00:40:00,126
我讓你把槍放下 不然讓你見上帝去
I said, drop it or meet Jesus.

343
00:40:06,936 --> 00:40:08,022
請 不要
No, please

344
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:09,117
馬丁

345
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:11,234
別
No!

346
00:40:11,401 --> 00:40:13,486
他還只是個孩子
He's just a boy.

347
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:19,993
你過來
You! Come here.

348
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,912
停下
That's enough.

349
00:40:24,523 --> 00:40:26,233
你後面還有多少人
How many behind you?

350
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:29,361
只有我們幾個
It's just us.

351
00:40:29,528 --> 00:40:32,447
我 還有你殺了的這些
Me and the men you killed.

352
00:40:32,614 --> 00:40:34,241
我不是和他們一夥兒的
I'm not one of them,

353
00:40:34,407 --> 00:40:37,285
我沒想做這些壞事
I don't wanna do any of this.

354
00:40:37,452 --> 00:40:38,703
我 我真的不是
I'm really not...

355
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:41,540
可你穿著長袍
You're wearing the fucking robe.

356
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:43,124
他們逼我穿的
They made me.

357
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:45,418
他們威脅要把我喂吸血鬼
They said they'd feed me to the vamps.

358
00:40:45,585 --> 00:40:47,295
我發誓
I swear.

359
00:40:47,306 --> 00:40:49,015
要我做什麼都可以 求求你
I'll do anything. Please...

360
00:40:49,172 --> 00:40:51,299
我真的不想死
I just don't wanna die.

361
00:40:51,466 --> 00:40:54,094
你最好沒在撒謊 孩子
You better not be lying, boy,

362
00:40:54,261 --> 00:40:57,347
我今天殺氣正盛
because I'm in a dick shooting mood today.

363
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,267
知道了 先生
Yes, sir.

364
00:41:09,276 --> 00:41:11,987
放在十年前你已經殺了他
Ten years ago you would've shot him already.

365
00:41:12,153 --> 00:41:13,655
我不喜歡這樣
I don't like it.

366
00:41:13,822 --> 00:41:16,449
你不必喜歡
You don't have to like it.

367
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:29,296
在那邊加把勁
Over there, come on.

368
00:41:29,462 --> 00:41:30,714
我想讓他再靠近些
I want him closer.

369
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,725
好的 放這裏 這兒
OK, here. Here, here.

370
00:41:43,893 --> 00:41:45,437

371
00:41:46,187 --> 00:41:48,440
嘿 嘿 看著他

372
00:42:17,965 --> 00:42:19,967
喔 喔 嘿
Whoa, whoa, hey.

373
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,682
你真要這麼做嗎 孩子
You sure about that, boy?

374
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:24,643
這取決於你怎麼做
That's up to you.

375
00:42:29,629 --> 00:42:31,887
你們在哪找到一個聖滾者的
{\fs15}*五旬節教派基督教徒 常有受聖靈感召而滿地打滾 或說話時舌頭失控
Where did you find the Holy Roller?

376
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:33,196
我們殺了其中兩個
We killed two of them,

377
00:42:33,207 --> 00:42:34,903
他投降了
he surrendered.

378
00:42:36,363 --> 00:42:38,615
他為什麼還活著
Why is he still alive?

379
00:42:38,782 --> 00:42:41,451
因為他不讓我殺了他
Because he wouldn't let me kill him.

380
00:42:41,618 --> 00:42:43,328
他怎麼了
What's With him?

381
00:42:43,495 --> 00:42:44,901
他肚子上插著一個吸血鬼的爪
Got a vamp in his lung,

382
00:42:44,963 --> 00:42:47,123
現在你們要射我們還是幫我們
now are you gonna shoot us or are you gonna help us?

383
00:42:48,124 --> 00:42:50,126
他叫什麼
What's his name?

384
00:42:50,585 --> 00:42:52,545
大家都叫他 先生
They call him Mister.

385
00:43:11,314 --> 00:43:12,941
我是巴特
It's Bat.

386
00:43:14,818 --> 00:43:16,736
你個婊子養的
You son of a bitch,

387
00:43:18,697 --> 00:43:20,657
我以為你死了
I thought you were dead.

388
00:43:20,824 --> 00:43:22,534
看起來像死了嗎
I look dead to you?

389
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:25,745
是 你看起來有點像死了

390
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:29,666
你最近怎麼樣 老頭
How you doing, old timer?

391
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:31,000
再叫我老頭
You call me old timer again,

392
00:43:31,167 --> 00:43:33,169
我會給你長長見識

別擔心 我們會治好你的
Don't worry, we'll get you fixed up.

396
00:43:58,486 --> 00:44:01,614
現在殘餘的封鎖區不多
There aren't a lot of lockdowns left

397
00:44:01,781 --> 00:44:04,159
而附近的那些個
and the ones that are still around

398
00:44:04,325 --> 00:44:06,911
也不是你想要去的地方
ain't places you wanna be.

399
00:44:09,789 --> 00:44:12,625
外面仍然有好的東西存在
There's still good out there.

400
00:44:12,792 --> 00:44:15,044
我相信這點
I believe that.

401
00:44:18,757 --> 00:44:21,342
但你遇到它的時候總是太晚
But it always finds you too late.

402
00:44:27,307 --> 00:44:30,059
他們有防護牆 武器
They had walls, weapons...

403
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:33,480
我本應該滿懷希望的
I should have been hopeful.

404
00:44:35,447 --> 00:44:37,190
長久以來第一次
That was the first time in a long time

405
00:44:37,268 --> 00:44:39,152
我感覺到有安全感
that somewhere felt safe,

406
00:44:39,778 --> 00:44:41,863
但我不能休息
but I couldn't rest.

407
00:44:43,031 --> 00:44:45,283
因為她仍然還活著
Not while she was still out there.

408
00:45:44,759 --> 00:45:45,969
我們給你帶了點吃的
I brought you something to eat.

409
00:45:51,177 --> 00:45:53,304
吃完後 盤子放到外面來

嗯 他傷勢仍然比較嚴重
Well, he's mostly mean and ugly,

426
00:46:59,042 --> 00:47:00,418
但我想他會挺過來的
but I think he'll make it.

427
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:03,171
他應該在幾天內能夠站起來
He should be up on his feet in a couple of days.

428
00:47:04,839 --> 00:47:05,882
你是醫生嗎

429
00:47:05,955 --> 00:47:06,900
是的 我是
Yeah, that I am.

430
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:08,174
嗯 我之前是一個獸醫
Well, I was a veterinarian,

431
00:47:08,301 --> 00:47:11,387
但自從秋天以來 我基本在醫人
but since the fall I fix people up mostly.

432
00:47:11,554 --> 00:47:15,808
肉 血 骨 道理都差不多
Flesh, blood, bone... it's all the same shit.

433
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:19,387
先生說你以前給他療過傷
Mister said that you'd that you'd patched him up before?

434
00:47:19,402 --> 00:47:20,313
沒錯
That I did.

435
00:47:20,355 --> 00:47:21,856
巴特和我們以前在墨西哥待過
Bat and I were with him in Mexico,

436
00:47:22,023 --> 00:47:23,900
災難剛開始的時候

440
00:50:36,843 --> 00:50:38,469
尤達

441
00:50:39,887 --> 00:50:42,723
他們不會讓我出去
They ain't gonna let me out...

442
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:44,642
他們會
They're gonna...

443
00:50:44,653 --> 00:50:46,404
他們會殺了我嗎
they're gonna kill me!

444
00:50:49,772 --> 00:50:51,732
嘿 別這樣
Hey, come on.

445
00:50:58,698 --> 00:51:00,491
嘿
Hey.

446
00:51:01,534 --> 00:51:03,077
嗨
Hi.

447
00:51:03,499 --> 00:51:05,459
你不會有事的
You're gonna be okay,

448
00:51:05,634 --> 00:51:07,803
過些時間他們的態度就會軟化的
just gotta give them some time to soften up.

449
00:51:07,915 --> 00:51:11,544
你不能 你不能放我出去嗎
Can't you... cant you just let me out?

450
00:51:11,836 --> 00:51:14,422
我意思是 我不會惹事的
I mean, I don't want any trouble.

451
00:51:14,589 --> 00:51:17,717
我只想逃走 求求你
I'll just run off. Please!

452
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,613
我不能
I can't.

453
00:51:22,562 --> 00:51:25,315
求求你 比利 別走
Please, Billie, don't go.

454
00:51:27,343 --> 00:51:29,846
這是一個老修道院
It's an old convent.

455
00:51:29,858 --> 00:51:31,139
兄弟會把它從修女手裏奪走
The Brotherhood took it from the nuns

456
00:51:31,156 --> 00:51:32,883
我們把它從兄弟會手裏奪過來
and we took it from the Brotherhood.

457
00:51:33,107 --> 00:51:34,930
那是很久以前的事了
That was a ways back

458
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:37,455
那時還沒有組織得這麼井井有條
before they got so fucking organized.

459
00:51:37,612 --> 00:51:39,488
每個人都各盡所能
Everybody pulls their weight here.

460
00:51:39,655 --> 00:51:41,282
我們有老師
You got teachers,

461
00:51:41,449 --> 00:51:43,284
我們有幾個木匠
we got a couple of carpenters,

462
00:51:43,586 --> 00:51:46,162
我們還有退伍軍人
we got ex-military men...

463
00:51:46,329 --> 00:51:48,080
他們都是好人
they're all good people.

464
00:51:48,247 --> 00:51:50,499
四周有帶刺鐵絲網環繞
There's a barbed-wire fence that runs the perimeter,

465
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:52,668
這地方雖然看起來不咋地 但是通電
doesn't look like much but it's electrified

466
00:51:52,733 --> 00:51:54,944
所以生活也更有趣
so that makes it fun.

467
00:51:55,213 --> 00:51:58,174
是啊 我們在新伊甸有一些太陽能電池
Yeah, we had a couple of solar cells in New Eden but

468
00:51:58,341 --> 00:51:59,759
但從來沒有產出這麼大的電力
never could have drawn this much power.

469
00:51:59,926 --> 00:52:02,303
是我的兩個雙胞胎妹子在提供這些
Yeah, I got my twin girls for that.

470
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:04,305
看到那兩台發電機了嗎
See these two gennies?

471
00:52:04,472 --> 00:52:07,016
他們為這整個地方提供電力
They power the whole damn fandango.

472
00:52:07,183 --> 00:52:10,311
但你從來沒見過我最喜歡的部分
But you ain't even seen my favorite part.

473
00:52:27,114 --> 00:52:28,704
可以淋浴了
The shower's free.

474
00:52:28,871 --> 00:52:30,248
好的 女士 輪到你了
Alright, Lady, it's your turn.

475
00:52:30,414 --> 00:52:31,207

476
00:52:31,769 --> 00:52:32,364
走
Come on!

477
00:52:32,429 --> 00:52:34,723

Here you go.

478
00:52:37,129 --> 00:52:39,507
給你準備了些乾淨的衣服
There's some clean clothes there for you.

479
00:52:58,526 --> 00:53:00,447

481
00:53:05,283 --> 00:53:08,494

Alright, alright! Take it easy, goddamn it.

482
00:53:08,661 --> 00:53:10,496
你怎麼樣 老夥計
How are you feeling, old buddy?

483
00:53:10,663 --> 00:53:12,999
噢 感覺就像一桶狗屎
Oh, like a bucket of shit.

484
00:53:13,666 --> 00:53:15,835
我想喝一杯 你帶了嗎
I could use a drink. You carrying?

485
00:53:16,002 --> 00:53:17,420
有點早了吧 不是嗎
It's a little early, ain't it?

486
00:53:17,586 --> 00:53:18,671
這不在中國
Not in China.

487
00:53:18,838 --> 00:53:21,632
對 你太瞭解我了
Yep, you know me too well.

00:53:24,635 --> 00:53:25,386
墨西哥酒

00:53:25,553 --> 00:53:27,513
墨西哥
Mexico.

491
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:32,852
我要在這裏躺多久
How long do I have to lay here?

492
00:53:33,019 --> 00:53:36,490
噢 大約一兩天
Oh, I'd say just about a day or two.

493
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,349
把它給我
Gimme that.

494
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:37,922
為什麼
What?

495
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:40,535
這只能藥用
This is for medicinal purposes only.

496
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,240
給孩子嘗嘗拿著
Here, kid, you try it.

497
00:53:46,407 --> 00:53:47,658
給 嘗嘗
Go ahead.

498
00:53:47,832 --> 00:53:50,460
巴特自己釀的
Bat makes this stuff himself.

499
00:53:50,619 --> 00:53:52,038
讓你雙蛋充滿活力
Make your balls bounce.

500
00:53:52,204 --> 00:53:54,290
哦 是的 下流的東西
Oh yeah, that stuff is nasty.

501
00:53:54,457 --> 00:53:56,625
下流 骯髒
Nasty, nasty.

502
00:53:56,792 --> 00:53:58,252
讓他休息一下
Let's let the man rest a bit.

503
00:53:58,419 --> 00:53:59,620
對
Yeah.

504
00:54:00,796 --> 00:54:01,922
很高興再次見到你
Real good to see you again.

505
00:54:02,089 --> 00:54:03,924
很高興見到你巴特
Good to see you, Bat.

506
00:54:06,594 --> 00:54:07,678
你也走小女孩
Come on, you too, little girl.

507
00:54:07,845 --> 00:54:08,929
別管她
Nah, leave her.

508
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:10,330
謝謝你醫生
Thanks, Doc.

509
00:54:10,396 --> 00:54:11,275
好的
Yeah.

510
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:13,684
傷口痛的時候你就叫我來
Let me know if you need anything for the pain.

511
00:54:13,851 --> 00:54:15,186
好的
Yeah.

512
00:54:35,289 --> 00:54:36,499
尤達
Juda?

513
00:54:37,917 --> 00:54:39,752
你還好嗎
You feelin' alright?

514
00:54:41,337 --> 00:54:42,880
尤達
Juda?

515
00:54:47,385 --> 00:54:48,844
哦 上帝啊 尤達
Oh my God! Juda!

516
00:55:08,948 --> 00:55:11,409
當墨西哥被吸血鬼佔領後
When, uh, Mexico went vamp shit,

517
00:55:11,575 --> 00:55:13,494
我們撤出了我們朝北走
we pulled out, we headed north.

518
00:55:15,955 --> 00:55:18,290
先生在邊境區
Mister had a wife

519
00:55:18,457 --> 00:55:21,502
娶了個老婆 生了個孩子
and a child across the border.

520
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,966
當時南方情況不好
It wasn't pretty down south.

521
00:55:27,133 --> 00:55:29,009
很糟
It was bad.

522
00:55:29,176 --> 00:55:30,970
簡直糟透了
Bad as it gets.

523
00:55:32,471 --> 00:55:36,684
糟糕到他內心難以忍受
So bad that something snapped inside that man.

524
00:55:36,851 --> 00:55:38,582
這就像一個
It was like a...

525
00:55:38,811 --> 00:55:40,540
像一個開關
like a switch.

526
00:55:42,106 --> 00:55:44,692
他當時腦子裏想的全是殺
All he wanted to do was kill.

527
00:55:45,734 --> 00:55:47,820
他從來沒有抓到殺了他全家的那個
Well, he never got the one that killed his family,

528
00:55:47,987 --> 00:55:52,199
所以我想 如果他殺不了那一個
so the way I figured it, if he couldn't get the one,

529
00:55:52,366 --> 00:55:53,826
那他就會殺光它們所有
he'd get 'em all.

530
00:55:55,953 --> 00:55:58,497
是啊 我們一起待了不久
But we stayed together for a while.

531
00:55:58,664 --> 00:56:00,458
然後就分開了
And then we split.

532
00:56:23,105 --> 00:56:25,024
他想到馬裏蘭去找他的夥伴
He wanted to check on his folks up in Maryland

533
00:56:25,191 --> 00:56:28,110
巴特和我朝北走
and Bat and I we headed north.

534
00:56:28,277 --> 00:56:29,820
是的
That's right.

535
00:56:29,987 --> 00:56:32,990
和其它逃跑的人一起走
With everybody else who was running away.

536
00:56:33,157 --> 00:56:36,076
是的 然後美國開始出現吸血鬼疫情
Yeah and then the shit hit the fan in the States.

537
00:56:36,243 --> 00:56:39,163
一切美好的事物都破碎了
Whole fuckin' enchilada fell apart.

538
00:56:40,915 --> 00:56:42,958
關於這一點
And on that note...

539
00:56:44,793 --> 00:56:47,004
再喝一杯怎麼樣嗎
How about we get another drink?

540
00:56:47,546 --> 00:56:50,216
哥們我十點鐘得去巡視指揮
And I got ten o'clock watch. I gotta head out.

541
00:56:50,382 --> 00:56:53,427
你替我和他喝兩杯吧 小伙子
Now, you knock back a couple for me, young buck.

542
00:56:56,847 --> 00:56:58,265
好的
Yeah.

543
00:57:14,949 --> 00:57:16,158
嗨
Hi.

544
00:57:16,325 --> 00:57:18,077

謝謝
Thanks.

546
00:57:21,288 --> 00:57:23,123
咱們走 親愛的 走吧
Come on, honey. Come on.

547
00:57:42,184 --> 00:57:43,978
小子
Boy!

548
00:57:52,653 --> 00:57:54,280
婊子養的
Son of a bitch!

549
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:08,635
赫利俄準備好了嗎
{\fs15}*古希臘神話中的太陽神
ls Helios ready?!

550
00:58:08,667 --> 00:58:09,712
差不多
Almost.

551
00:58:09,808 --> 00:58:10,957
赫利俄斯是誰
Who's Helios?

552
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:13,299
夜晚的陽光寶貝兒
Sunshine in the nighttime, baby.

553
00:58:13,799 --> 00:58:15,551
他們要衝破大門了
They're gonna ram the fucking gate!

554
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:27,104
快點 快
Coming up quick. Coming up quick.

555
00:58:27,271 --> 00:58:28,230
來個人掩護我
Somebody cover me.

556
00:58:28,397 --> 00:58:30,190
赫利俄斯開始
Helios now!

557
00:58:38,282 --> 00:58:40,242
這就是送給你們這些混蛋的太陽神
That's Helios for your ass!

558
00:58:42,703 --> 00:58:44,913
離窗戶遠點
Get away from the goddamn window!

559
00:58:45,956 --> 00:58:47,458
媽的
Shit!

560
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:49,001
你留在這裏 不要動
You stay here and don't you move,

561
00:58:49,168 --> 00:58:50,628
你聽到了嗎
you hear me?

562
00:58:50,878 --> 00:58:51,962
我們得撤退
We gotta move!

563
00:59:07,102 --> 00:59:08,562
操
Fuck...

564
00:59:34,713 --> 00:59:36,298
這就對了滾回去
Oh yeah, take your asses home.

565
00:59:39,134 --> 00:59:40,886
放開我 放開我
Let me go! Let me go!

566
00:59:41,053 --> 00:59:42,680
這不值得 孩子 她會殺了你的
Not worth it, kid, she'll kill you.

567
00:59:42,846 --> 00:59:44,473
我不在乎
I don't care.

568
00:59:46,308 --> 00:59:48,060
我在乎
I do.

569
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,991
赫利俄斯擋住了它們
Helios held them back,

570
01:00:17,069 --> 01:00:18,987
但我們還是犧牲了六個
but we still lost six.

571
01:00:21,385 --> 01:00:23,303
嘿 看看我們抓到誰了
Hey, look who we found.

572
01:00:30,035 --> 01:00:31,972
把他放地下室去
Put him in the basement!

573
01:00:32,113 --> 01:00:35,629
別擔心 我們要慢慢地壓榨他
Don't worry, we're gonna squeeze him,

574
01:00:37,539 --> 01:00:41,035
你是對的 我們早該殺了那個聖滾者
You were right. We should of killed that Holy Roller

575
01:00:41,774 --> 01:00:43,278
阿門
Amen.

576
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:53,984
外面還有多少你這種上帝的敗類
How many Jesus junkies are out there?

577
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:55,486
非常多
There's plenty more.

578
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:57,571
多得你數不過來
More than you could count.

579
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:02,034
你們在哪兒宿營
Where ya campin'?

580
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:04,036
你們沒時間了
You're out of time...

581
01:01:05,037 --> 01:01:06,521
問這有什麼用
what does it matter?

582
01:01:06,662 --> 01:01:08,130
聽著 尤達
Well, Juda,

583
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:10,127
你不快速配合就得慢慢受折磨
we can do this fast, or we can do this slow.

584
01:01:10,209 --> 01:01:12,336
這完全取決於你
It's totally up to you.

585
01:01:12,731 --> 01:01:15,547
你們每個都會死
Every one of you is gonna die...

586
01:01:15,745 --> 01:01:17,914
你們贏不了的
and you cant win,

587
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:20,636
因為上帝站在我們這一邊
not while we got God on our side.

588
01:01:20,803 --> 01:01:21,845
你也知道
You know,

589
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:25,074
小神經最疼了
It's it's the small nerves that hurt the most.

590
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:26,488
知道我在說什麼嗎
You know what I'm saying?

591
01:01:26,603 --> 01:01:28,761
你知道自己的
And do you realize just how many small nerves

592
01:01:29,011 --> 01:01:31,035
指尖有多少的小神經嗎
you got in your finger tips?

593
01:01:33,265 --> 01:01:35,017
相當多
You got lots.

594
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,910
是上帝派它們來的
God has sent them.

595
01:01:45,077 --> 01:01:46,203
上帝是偉大的
God is great.

596
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:48,789
上帝在我體內
God is in me.

597
01:01:48,956 --> 01:01:52,292
而她是他的劍
And She is his sword.

598
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:54,802
現在 現在 現在 現在
Now, now, now, now...

599
01:01:54,932 --> 01:01:56,183
那個長尖牙的是誰
Who is this fang twat

600
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,324
她找我們幹嘛
and what does she want with us anyway?

601
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:04,138
她是來找我的
She's after me.

602
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,602
我昨天晚上猶豫著沒說
I wasn't sure 'till last night.

603
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:12,813
她是種新型吸血鬼
She's something new.

604
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:14,773
會繁殖後代的
A breeder.

605
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:18,485
不久前前我殺了她孩子
I killed her squirt a while back,

606
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:20,738
刺瞎了她一隻眼睛
I took her eye out...

607
01:02:22,573 --> 01:02:24,950
她利用你來找到我
She used you to find me.

608
01:02:28,036 --> 01:02:30,831
對不起 孩子
I'm sorry, kid.

609
01:02:30,998 --> 01:02:33,125
這不值得 對嗎
That ain't worth shit, is it?

610
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:05,532
讓你回憶起某人了嗎
Remind you of someone?

611
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:10,204
你最好在它們來之前
You better get your people up the mountain

612
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:12,289
把你的人都轉移到山上
before they get here.

613
01:03:21,799 --> 01:03:23,884
一號急令 一號急令
Code one. Code one.

614
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:27,805
所有人員都將在19時撤走
All personnel will evacuate at 19:00 hours.

615
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:30,265
只把必要的物品打包帶上
Pack only what is necessary.

616
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:32,935
到院子裏集合等候進一步的指示
Meet in the courtyard for further instructions.

617
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:35,020
這是一次疏散
This is evac...

618
01:03:54,081 --> 01:03:55,916
你有計劃嗎
You got a plan?

619
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:57,626
有
YUP

620
01:03:57,793 --> 01:03:59,044
等到那個婊子現身
I'm gonna wait till that bitch shows up

621
01:03:59,211 --> 01:04:01,213
然後給她一刀
and I'm gonna take it to her.

622
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:05,676
送死可不是個好計劃孩子
Dying ain't much of a plan, boy.

623
01:04:05,843 --> 01:04:07,970
我真的不在乎
I really don't give a shit.

624
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:09,513
死就死
Dead's dead,

625
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,640
帶上她陪葬
as long as I take her with me.

626
01:04:18,814 --> 01:04:22,150
她想要我以眼還眼
She wants to hurt me like I hurt her.

627
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:24,361
是的 你會離開這兒的
Yep, and you're leavin'.

628
01:04:35,581 --> 01:04:37,374
是啊 也許沒法離開
Yeah, maybe not.

629
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:40,961
如果我留下來
If I stay,

630
01:04:41,128 --> 01:04:43,297
殺不了她的話 那咱們就得死
we stake her ass or we die trying.

631
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:45,320
不管怎樣
Either way,

632
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,562
咱們等這些人上山再說
we buy these folks some time to make it up the mountain.

633
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,058
好
Okay-

634
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:57,394
好
Okay.

635
01:04:57,561 --> 01:04:59,313
你和我
You and me.

636
01:05:00,272 --> 01:05:03,817
不 不 不 你們兩個刑柱之主
No, no, no, no, you Stakelanders

637
01:05:03,984 --> 01:05:05,319
以為單憑兩個人就能殺了她
think you're gonna do this on your own?

638
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:06,820
獨享所有樂趣嗎
Just the two of you?

639
01:05:06,987 --> 01:05:09,156
你們又會到大麻煩的
Have all the fun? You got another thing coming.

640
01:05:09,323 --> 01:05:10,612
是的
Yeah,

641
01:05:11,732 --> 01:05:14,129
墨西哥起我們就一直逃跑
we been running ever since Mexico.

642
01:05:14,286 --> 01:05:16,330
個人來說 我有點累了
Personally, I'm a little tired of it.

643
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:18,457
這不是你的戰鬥 醫生
This ain't your fight, Doc.

644
01:05:18,624 --> 01:05:20,667
我們四個人都可能死掉
Odds are all four of us are gonna die.

645
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:24,129
是的 我聽說過 不管怎樣結局都是死
Yeah well, I hear that's gonna happen anyway.

646
01:05:24,296 --> 01:05:26,256
所以為什麼我們不積極面對了
So why don't we make it count.

647
01:05:29,176 --> 01:05:31,970
振作起來
Cheer up!

648
01:06:06,703 --> 01:06:09,437
放鬆 放鬆
Easy, Easy

649
01:06:10,156 --> 01:06:12,761
好的 對不起
Okay, I'm sorry.

650
01:06:36,702 --> 01:06:39,705
都準備好了可以走了
We got it all wired up, it's good to go.

651
01:06:41,373 --> 01:06:43,875
那些吸血鬼 不知道自己會被什麼擊中
Fuckin' blood bags won't know what hit 'em.

652
01:06:44,418 --> 01:06:46,920
誰在戰鬥結束後存活下來
Now, if anybody is left when it's over,

653
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:49,047
就往山上去
head for the mountains.

654
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:50,757
好的
Yeah.

655
01:06:51,717 --> 01:06:54,344
讓我們殺死那些該死的吸血鬼 嗯
Let's kill some goddamn blood suckers, eh?

656
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:56,998
小心身後
Watch your back.

657
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:59,890
只把必要的物品打包帶上

658
01:07:00,406 --> 01:07:03,225
到院子裏集合等候進一步的指示

659
01:07:03,634 --> 01:07:06,978
這是一次疏散

660
01:07:07,298 --> 01:07:09,673
一號急令

661
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:14,345
我重複一遍這是一次疏散

662
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:16,491
她會有事嗎
She's gonna be alright.

663
01:07:22,998 --> 01:07:25,709
我女兒的名字叫 羅斯
My daughter's name was Rose.

664
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:12,005
你這樣還能瞄的准嗎
Are you sure you're gonna be able to shoot straight?

665
01:08:13,799 --> 01:08:15,801
不喝才瞄不準
Couldn't shoot straight without it.

666
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:20,680
搞什麼鬼
What the hell?

667
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:22,612
他們從後面來了
Comin' from the back!

668
01:08:22,643 --> 01:08:24,020
噢 天啊 它在從這兒經
Oh, jeez!  There's movement here

669
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:24,926
快快 快移動
Come on. Come on. Come on, move it!

670
01:08:25,048 --> 01:08:26,758
你留在這兒 看著車子
Stay here. Watch the camp.

671
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,127
好
Qkay...

672
01:08:54,673 --> 01:08:56,633
她要對我們使詐
She's trying to pull a fast one on us.

673
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,260
是的 沒錯
Yeah, well,

674
01:08:58,426 --> 01:09:00,887
它們可以採取任何方式
they can come and get it any way they want.

675
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:09,357
咱們等他們靠近再說
Let's wait 'till they're close,

676
01:09:09,448 --> 01:09:11,325
我們不想浪費彈藥
we don't wanna waste ammo.

677
01:09:40,135 --> 01:09:41,761
他們在做什麼
What the hell are they doing?

678
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:43,722
他們為什麼停下
Why are they stopping?

679
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:49,519
管它為什麼
I don't need this shit.

680
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:51,146
咱們開火吧
Let's light 'em up!

681
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:53,356
這跑來個人
We got a runner!

682
01:09:53,732 --> 01:09:55,650
就在前面 嘿
Up front! Hey!

683
01:09:57,402 --> 01:09:58,831
他正朝著發電機方向跑去
He's heading for the genny!

684
01:10:00,197 --> 01:10:01,281
嘿
Hey!

685
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:03,992
快離開那個
Get your asses--

686
01:10:10,999 --> 01:10:13,126

Back up front, back up front!

688
01:10:40,487 --> 01:10:41,363
嘿
Hey!

689
01:10:46,534 --> 01:10:48,995
快 快 進去 把它們往這邊引
Come on, Bat. Lead 'em this way.

690
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:00,966
來呀 你個婊子
Come on, you bitch!

691
01:11:03,718 --> 01:11:06,471
你想抓我 過來試試
You want me? Come and get some!

692
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:44,843
繼續跑 這條路
Keep going! This way!

693
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:06,698
你沒打中她心臟他媽的
You missed the heart, goddammit!

694
01:12:42,465 --> 01:12:43,299
媽的
Shit!

695
01:12:43,310 --> 01:12:44,143
該死的
Damn!

696
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,568
我們被壓制住了
We're pinned down, man.

697
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:48,919
如果我們出去
We're not getting out.

698
01:12:50,129 --> 01:12:51,356
我們不能出去
We're not getting out of this one!

699
01:12:51,414 --> 01:12:52,581
不 我們不能
No, we ain't.

700
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:54,454
你得這麼做
You gotta do it!

701
01:12:54,621 --> 01:12:55,714
我得這麼做
We gotta do it.

702
01:12:55,755 --> 01:12:56,941
你必須這樣做
You got to do it!

703
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:18,311
我在這裏 婊子
I'm over here, bitch!

704
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:45,463
結果她 孩子
Finish her, kid.

705
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:07,652
感覺好點了嗎
You feel better?

706
01:14:11,906 --> 01:14:14,075
沒有
No...

707
01:14:14,242 --> 01:14:16,453
只是沒覺得更糟
but I don't feel worse.

708
01:14:18,291 --> 01:14:20,209
我現在感覺跟狗屎一樣
I feel like shit.

709
01:14:21,082 --> 01:14:22,959
你看上去跟狗屎一樣
You look like shit.

710
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:38,766
這是一次偉大的旅程 巴特
It's been a great ride, Bat.

711
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:40,518
這是一次偉大的旅程
It's been a great ride.

712

我愛你

01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:44,814
我愛你
I love you.

714
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:49,652
現在讓我們送這些吸血鬼下地獄去吧
Now, let's take these bloodsuckers to Hell.

715
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:02,665
走 老頭 我們走吧
Come on, old man.

716
01:15:53,007 --> 01:15:54,676
她死了
She's gone.

717
01:15:54,842 --> 01:15:55,850
她死了
She's gone.

是我 他是先生
It's me... It's Mister.

721

先生
Mister...

727
01:18:40,037 --> 01:18:42,247
我沒法再堅持了 孩子
I can't do this anymore, kid.

728
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:47,390
千萬不要這麼想
Don't even think about it.

729
01:18:51,314 --> 01:18:53,149
我會盡可能久的給你拖住它們
I'll buy you as much time as I can.

730
01:18:53,232 --> 01:18:54,286
不
No.

731
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:57,308
不 我要留下咱們一起戰鬥
No, I'm gonna stay and we'll fight.

732
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:10,287
一個男人總是希望 他的兒子比他更出色
A man wants his son to be better than he is.

733
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:27,638
記住
Git.

734
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:41,486
我不知道後來他怎麼樣了
I don't know what happened to him.

735
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:46,407
我想這不重要
Guess it doesn't matter.

736
01:19:49,786 --> 01:19:51,996
但我知道我會再見到他
But I know I'll see him again.

737
01:19:55,249 --> 01:19:57,043
不是在這個地獄就是在下一個地獄
In this Hell or the next.
