{\an8}一條狗的使命

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,990
生命的意義是什么
What is the meaning of life?

21
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,940
我們是因為什么原因而生的嗎
Are we here for a reason?

22
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,670
我們為什么要活著
Is there a point to any of this?

23
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,960
起初  我也不知道是怎么回事
First, I had no idea what was going on.

24
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,090
我什么都看不見
I... I couldn't see a thing.

25
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,770
很溫暖
It was warm.

26
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,680
這是我的媽媽
There was my mother.

27
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,710
每一天  我都過得很愉快
Every day, I had fun.

28
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,890
過得愉快就是生命的意義嗎
Was having fun the point?

29
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,200
全部的意義
The whole point?

30
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,420
不對  肯定不會這么簡單的
No, it couldn't be that simple.

31
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,100
這有一只
Here's one.

32
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,790
然后一切都結束了
And then it was over.

33
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,060
你就這樣了
That's it for you.

{\an8}捕狗隊

35
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,720
不能再玩鬧了
No more fun.

36
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,760
好像這一生過得太短了
It seemed like such a short life.

37
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,380
我做過什么事情嗎
I mean, what exactly did I do?

38
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,650
只是一直玩耍
There was some playing.

39
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,810
吃東西
There was some eating.

40
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,910
還在泥里打滾
I dug in the dirt.

41
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,610
但是當我真正思考起來之后
But when I really thought about it,

42
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,990
我真的沒做什么事
it didn't add up to much.

43
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,880
我回來了
I was back.

44
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,560
我又變成一條小狗了
And I was a puppy again.

45
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,980
我還活著  準備好思考生命的大問題
Alive and ready to ask the big questions.

46
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,480
去刨根問底
To dig for answers.

47
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,450
先讓我進去
Just let me in there.

48
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,880
我在哪呢
Where am I?

49
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,270
你這里還有什么狗
So what else do you have?

50
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,420
還有這一只
Uh, this one here.

51
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,870
-這是什么品種  -這是紅毛獵犬
- What is it? - It's a red retriever.

52
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,340
好狗狗
Nice dog.

53
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,530
不挑食  而且容易訓練
Good breed. Easy to train.

54
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,790
你這里有沒有小一點的品種
You got something smaller?

55
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,390
我還有幾只小約克夏犬
I got some cute yorkies over here.

56
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,030
還有日本狆

57
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:47,950
貴賓犬
Uh, poodle.

58
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,840
這邊是柯基
Corgi over here.

59
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,060
還有博美
Got a pomeranian.

60
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,530
看看這些好東西
Look at all this great stuff.

61
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,530
一定是有人知道我要來
Somebody knew I was coming.

62
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,910
好棒呀
Oh, yeah.

63
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,880
你快看
Hey, look at this.

64
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,060
看看我們找到了什么
What do we have here?

65
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,100
看看這個小家伙
Look at this little guy.

66
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,240
肯定能值幾個錢
Bet it's worth a couple bucks.

67
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,100
第二輪就輸了
Yeah, it was a knockout in the second round.

68
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,570
錢都輸光了  這在等著
I lost everything. Hang tight, guy.

69
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,370
這次該你請客了吧
Now, you're buying this time.

70
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,990
今天不行  伙計
Not today, buddy.

71
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,290
我思考著我的生活
I thought about my life.

72
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,440
我還有好多問題沒有解決
I still had so many questions.

73
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,420
但是我現在只有一個問題
But I kept coming back to the same one:

74
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,340
我要怎么才能喝上水
How do I get a drink of water?

75
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,430
你想要一個冰淇淋嗎
Do you want to get an ice cream?

76
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,300
好呀
Sure.

77
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,940
要什么口味的
What flavor?

78
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,900
媽媽  我聽到里面有聲音
Mom, I hear something in there.

79
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,230
寶貝

它看起來渴極了
It looks so thirsty.

84
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,130
車里面太熱了
It's too hot in there.

85
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,770
我們要把它救出來
I think we need to get him out.

86
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,160
這個門打不開
I can't open the door.

87
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,850
等等  門被鎖上了
Wait, it's locked.

88
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,950
求你了  媽媽

91
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,130
可憐的小東西
You poor, poor thing.

92
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,410
你還好嗎  伙計
How are you, boy?

93
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,930
-沒事吧  -這是什么情況

-媽媽  -一個小男孩

- Are you okay? - I-I never knew there might be

97
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,380
-世上還有小男孩這樣的存在  -是不是累壞了
- such a thing as a boy. - Tired, huh?

98
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,600
我覺得這小家伙會撐過去的
I think this little guy is gonna make it.

99
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,610
-我們能養他嗎  媽媽  -我不知道
- Can we keep him, mom? - I don't know.

100
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,410
我覺得你爸爸可能不會...
I think your father might not...

101
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,830
我當時就決定了
I decided right then and there

102
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,590
我一定要養這個小男孩
I am definitely keeping this boy.

103
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,030
爸爸  我們能養他嗎
Yeah! Dad, can we keep him?

104
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,430
誰來喂他
Well, who's gonna feed him?

105
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,070
-我來  -誰來給他洗澡
- I will. - Who's gonna clean him?

106
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,500
這些都交給我吧  爸爸
I'll do everything, dad.

107
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,560
-你覺得你已經準備好了嗎  -是的
- You think you're ready to do it? - Yeah.

108

-我不知道  兒子  -他是個好孩子
- Oh, I don't know, son. - He's a good boy.

是個乖寶寶
He's a good boy.

110
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,550
求你了

00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,100
它是只獵犬  爸爸
He's a retriever, dad.

112
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,420
他會幫你拿拖鞋的
He'll fetch your slippers.

113
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,130
下雨天還會幫你拿報紙
And the paper when it rains.

114
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,720
你讓他拿什么都可以

115
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,930
他都能做到
He can do it.

116
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,220
看  過來
Look. Hey, come here!

117
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,250
你在干什么
What are you doing?

118
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,450
伊森和我覺得
So, Ethan and I discussed that the dog

119
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,910
-他可以照顧好這條狗  -過來  乖孩子
- would be his responsibility. - Come here! Yeah. Good boy.

120
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,320
求你了  爸爸
Please, dad?

121
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,220
他需要朋友
Come on. He needs a pal.

122
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,080
聽著  你和你媽媽一起說服我  
All right, this thing that you two are doing,

123
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,900
這不公平
it's dirty pool, okay?

124
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,610
把他帶出去
Take him away.

125
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,000
我要和你媽媽單獨談談
I want to talk to your mother alone.

126
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,930
好的
Okay.

127
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,020
我們可以留它到明天
We'll keep it till tomorrow...

128
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,200
你緊張嗎  伙計  別緊張
You nervous, boy? Don't be.

129
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,510
不會有事的
It'll be okay. Yeah.

130
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,840
我們沒有多少選擇
We don't have much choice.

131
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
狗很麻煩的
They make a mess.

132
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,180
-你還要給它洗澡  -拜托
- You gotta clean 'em. - Oh, come on.

133
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,350
-過不了多久他就煩了  -別這樣  吉姆
- He's gonna be bored with it. - Oh, come on, Jim.

134
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,030
你知道的  你知道他三分鐘熱度
You know it. You know how he is.

135
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,070
如果他不同意的話  
If he says no,

136
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,030
我們可以離家出走  去找新家
we can run off and go find another family.

137
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,500
伊森

138
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,470
什么
Yeah?

139
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,910
你能養狗了
You have a dog.

140
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,840
太棒了  太好了
Yes! Oh, my gosh, yes!

141
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,020
天吶  謝謝

B-a-I-l-e-y, I-I would think.

145
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,610
我是伊森
And I'm Ethan.

146
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,470
我是他的主人
I'm the owner.

147
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,790
他知道我名字怎么寫嗎
Do you think he knows how to spell my name?

148
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,650
應該知道  親愛的
I would think so, honey.

149
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,110
那就好
Here you go.

00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,350
{\an8}貝利

153
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,620
真好
Here you go.

154
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,270
準備好了嗎
Ready?

155
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,690
來吧  貝利
Come on, Bailey.

156
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,660
貝利  坐下
Bailey, sit.

157
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,380
坐下
Sit.

158
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,770
打個滾  打個滾
Roll over. Roll over.

159
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,990
快把那個吐出來
Get that out of your mouth!

160
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,410
快把那個吐出來
Get that out of your mouth.

161
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,650
好了  來這邊
Okay. Come here.

162
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,710
握個手  握個手
Shake your paw. Shake your paw.

163
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,590
來吧  好孩子
Come on. Yeah, good boy!

164
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,960
轉個身  轉個身
Turn around. Turn around.

165
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,720
-來吧  -他在說些什么
- Come on. - What's he saying?

166
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,430
-字數太多了  -來吧  來吧
- It's too many words. - Come on. Okay.

167
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,090
-我還是干這個吧  -過來
- I'm gonna do this now. - Come here.

168
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:28,920
干得好  干得好
Good job. Good job.

169
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,190
但相比之下  有個詞重復了很多次
But one word got said more than any other.

170
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,130
貝利  貝利  貝利  貝利  貝利
Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.

171
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,070
過了一會兒
After a while,

172
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,570
我開始明白這個詞的重要性
I came to understand the words that mattered.

173
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,350
我養了個男孩  他叫伊森
I had a boy, and his name was Ethan.

174
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,770
我也有名字
I got a name.

175
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,500
我叫貝利  貝利  貝利  貝利  貝利
My name was Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.

176
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,330
親愛的  真希望知道你和韋斯之間...
Oh, gee, honey, I wish I'd have known that you and Wes were...

177
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,780
我知道了自己在家的地位
I learned my place in the pack.

178
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,630
媽媽喜歡我
Mom liked me.

179
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,700
爸爸喜歡我
Dad liked me.

180
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,890
-是的  是的我知道  -超級喜歡
- Yes. Yes, no, I understand. - A lot.

181
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,890
不好意思  稍等一下
Oh, excuse me. Hold on. Come on.

182
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,410
一邊兒去
Get down a bit.

183
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,870
真替貓感到悲哀
I was sad for the cat.

184
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,110
很明顯他也想當一只狗
Obviously, he wanted to be a dog.

185
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,810
當不成又不是我的錯
Wasn't my fault he couldn't be a dog.

186
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,010
伊森  該睡覺啦
Ethan, it's time to go to bed.

187
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,700
該關燈了好嗎
Time to turn out the light, okay?

188
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,470
好的
Okay.

189
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,100
好了  來吧  來吧
Okay, come on. Come on.

190
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,800
來吧  來吧
Come on. Come on.

191
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,260
"別  別這么做  隊長"
"Don't! Don't do it, cap.

192
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,510
"給他吧  巴基"
"Let him have it, bucky.

193
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,820
"我們得給他點顏色看看"
"We'll pound some sense into this character.

194
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,810
"砰  泰山壓頂"
"Pow! Stomp!

195
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,180
"它沖著我們來了"
"It's coming right at us.

196
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,430
"快跳下去逃生"
Jump for your lives!"

197
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,410
伊森總能想出這樣有趣的游戲
Ethan always came up with such great games.

198
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,790
躲在毯子下說話  真是個天才
Making noise under a blanket. Genius.

199
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,590
每晚睡著之后
Every night as I fell asleep,

200
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,920
我都會覺得養一只伊森真開心
I thought about how happy I was that I had an Ethan.

201
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,250
也慶幸自己不是貓
And that I wasn't a cat.

202
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,470
貝利  到車里來
Bailey, get in the car.

203
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,400
來吧  孩子
Come on, boy.

204
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,120
我們走
Come on!

205
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,900
當家人想讓我出去透透氣時
Whenever the family wanted me to get some fresh smells,

206
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,830
我們都會開車兜兜風
we all got in the car for a ride.

207
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,660
青草  綠樹  蟾蜍  青苔  臭鼬
Grass, tree, toad, moss, skunk,

208
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,700
死臭鼬  池塘
dead skunk, pond,

209
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,450
泥土  山羊
mud, goat.

210
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,760
山羊
Goat!

211
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,880
人們每天都在思索同一個問題
Everyone was asking themself the same question

212
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,120
"為什么不是所有的東西都有山羊味"
"Why can't everything smell like goat?"

213
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,270
臭死了
Ooh, it stinks!

214
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,720
看看是誰來了
Oh, look who's here!

215
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,870
猜猜我們還帶了誰
Guess what we got.

216
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,250
帶了誰
What have you got?

217
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,900
你們帶了誰
What'd you get?

218
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,040
下來吧  貝利
Come on, Bailey.

219
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,870
-我的天  看看它  -一只小狗狗
- Oh, my. Look at this. - Oh! A puppy! -Oh, my gosh.

220
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,230
孩子  看這里
Here, boy. Here.

221
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,560
它要去哪兒
Where's he going?

222
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,780
我常常覺得
Sometimes I thought

223
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,130
生活中東想西想很浪費時間
that trying to make sense out of life could be a waste of time.

224
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,870
直接享受生活  順其自然
Maybe it was better to just really enjoy life

225
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,490
會不會更好呢
and leave it at that.

226
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,140
咦  大家去哪里了
Hey, where'd everybody go?

227
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,150
小雞們呢
Where's all the chickens?

228
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,520
貝利  貝利  貝利
Bailey! Bailey, Bailey!

229
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,370
伊森  伊森  伊森  伊森  伊森
Ethan, Ethan, Ethan, Ethan, Ethan!

230
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,780
老天爺  看看誰來啦
Oh, my goodness! Look who's here!

231
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,660
不知道為什么
For some reason,

232
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,520
他們不愿意和我一起玩這個球
they wouldn't share this ball with me.

233
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,140
跑吧  伊森  快跑
Yes! Run, Ethan, run!

234
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,850
眾所周知
Everybody knows

235
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,450
在球類運動歷史上
there's never been a game in the history of balls

236
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,830
還沒有過狗狗參賽的先例
that can't be improved by having a dog in it.

237
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,430
但這個球長得有點奇怪
But there was something weird about this ball.

238
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,810
寶藏
Treasure.

239
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,970
這才叫生活
Ah, this is the life.

240
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,940
誰還要嗎  吉姆  你的咖啡
Anyone else? Jim, your coffee?

241
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,980
-謝謝  -給你
- Oh, thank you. - Here you go.

242
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,480
大家都到齊了
Here we all are.

243
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,310
對呀  好好吃吧
Yeah. Enjoy your meal.

244
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,820
我喜歡老年人
I liked the old humans.

245
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,070
他們懂我
They got me.

246
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,230
可以不要喂狗吃東西了嗎
Would you please stop feeding the dog?

247
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,950
我們在試著訓練它
We're trying to train him.

248
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,110
我告訴過你了
I told you.

249
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,020
被抓現行了  不好意思
You caught me. I'm sorry.

250
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,140
可以把果醬遞給我嗎
Could you pass me the jam, please?

251
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,370
當我注意力不在吃上時  我就會亂想
When I wasn't thinking about food, my mind wandered.

252
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,090
我為什么會在這里
Why am I here?

253
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,460
有什么目的嗎
What's the purpose?

254
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,380
真爽  接著揉
Oh, yeah. Keep rubbing.

255
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,580
會有更多的培根嗎
And... Might there be more bacon?

256
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,870
看他的盤子里
Oh, look at his plate.

257
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,110
要知道  照這么吃下去
You know, the way you eat,

258
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,210
等你長大了之后  我們幾個加起來
you're gonna grow up to be bigger

259
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,760
都不夠你的塊頭大
than all of us put together.

260
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,990
前提是得有個和平年代
If there's a world to grow up in.

261
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,230
俄國人在古巴布置了導彈
These Russians are putting missiles in Cuba.

262
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,550
我們非得現在說這個嗎
Do we have to talk about that now?

263
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,600
-沒有啊  -對了  吉姆
- No. - So, um, Jim,

264
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,530
聽說你換了份辦公室工作
I hear you're up for a new office job.

265
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,720
不如跟我們講講這個吧
Why don't you tell us about that?

266
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,220
并沒有談成
That didn't work out.

267
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,770
他們想讓他出外勤
Well, they want him in the field.

268
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,760
頂級銷售員年年都有他名字
He's one of the top sellers every year.

269
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,860
我干的活是個燙手山芋
I got the job nobody wants.

270
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,440
吉姆  你非要這樣嗎
Jim, do you have to?

271
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,420
核打擊已經近在咫尺了
We're three seconds away from nuclear annihilation.

272
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,630
我和貝利能離桌了嗎
Uh, can me and Bailey be excused?

273
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:22,990
當然
Sure.

274
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,900
伊森很難過
Ethan was sad.

275
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,850
我不知道為什么
I didn't know why.

276
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,630
嗨  貝利
Hey, Bailey.

277
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,580
還記得美國隊長嗎
Captain America, remember?

278
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,110
他可以一瞬間就拆掉炸彈
He could take out that bomb in a second.

279
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,620
啪
Pow!

280
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,660
咻
Zap!

281
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,470
看來你挺喜歡呀
Oh, you like it, don't you?

282
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,470
來呀  來呀
Come on. Come on.

283
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,350
就是這樣
Yeah, boy.

284
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,870
貝利  準備好了
Okay, Bailey.

285
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,310
去撿回來
Get it, boy!

286
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,230
加油呀
Come on!

287
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,590
就是這樣伙計
Yeah, boy! Come on.

288
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,200
來  去哪兒了
Come on. Oh, where'd it go?

289
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,040
去哪兒了
Where'd it go?

290
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,550
在這呢  你看那是什么
Come on, boy! Oh! What is that?

291
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:27,860
把它撿回來
Get it, boy!

You know, I-I was thinking, with the numbers so high,

405
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,230
也許是時候讓我不再出差

他想讓我干什么
What does he want from me?

433
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,250
快拉  快拉
Come on. Come on.

434
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,060
我真想知道他在說什么
I really wish I knew what he was saying.

435
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,760
拉啊  拉啊  快
Go! Go! Come on!

436
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,020
你怎么回事  快拉啊
What's your problem? Come on!

437
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,740
我不知道他為什么不開心  但這讓我很著急
I don't know why he was so upset, but it made me anxious.

438
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,010
而我著急的時候  腸胃蠕動就非常快
And when I'm anxious, things kind of move super fast.

439
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,180
這還是第一次
This was a first.

440
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,200
從來沒見過他這么高興地清理我的糞便
I'd never seen him so happy to clean up after me.

441
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,540
太棒了  找到了
Yes! Found it!

442
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,690
這個甜點的關鍵是不能做得太甜了
It's important it shouldn't be too sweet.

443
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,250
-不  很好吃  -看到了嗎
- No, it's nice. Mmm. - See this?

444
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,730
接下來
Now, this...

445
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,480
你們將
That's something

446
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,810
-迎來一場視覺的盛宴  -不
- for your eyes to feast on. - No!

447
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,100
怎么了
What?

448
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,050
有老鼠
There's a rat.

449
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,450
-什么  什么  -就在那
- What? What? - Right there!

450
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,190
-在哪  不  我討厭老鼠  -在哪
- Where? No, I don't like rats. - Where?

451
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,770
-在哪  -沒事
- Where is it? - It's okay.

452
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:16,720
桌子下面
Under the table.

453
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,570
-我愛老鼠  -對  捉住它  貝利
- I love rats. - Yeah, go get it, Bailey.

454
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:20,960
-我什么也沒有看見 -在哪
- I don't see anything. - Where?

455
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,530
-跑到那了  -等等
- It's running over there. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait!

456
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,360
抓住狗  抓住狗
Get that dog! Get the dog.

457
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,630
-抓住狗  -貝利
- Get the dog. Get the... - Bailey!

458
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,440
-我什么都沒看到  -給我過來
- I don't see anything. - Come here.

459
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,770
-就在那里  -也許你看到的是小灰
- It's right there. - Maybe you saw Smokey.

460
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,900
-絕對不是小灰  -不  不是小灰
- Definitely not Smokey. - No, it wasn't Smokey.

461
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,340
我真的怕老鼠  我討厭老鼠
I really don't like rats. I don't like rats.

462
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,510
比起你怕它們  是老鼠更怕你吧
It's more scared of you than you are of him.

463
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:36,630
給我過來  貝利
Come here. Come here, Bailey.

464
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,450
-過來  -你能抓到他嗎  抓住他
- Come here! Come here. - Can you grab him? Grab him.

465
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,140
-吉姆  -貝利  過來
- Jim. - Bailey! Bailey, come here!

466
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,080
過來
Come here!

467
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:41,940
停下  別跑  貝利
Wait. Please, Bailey.

468
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,650
-你能抓到他嗎  吉姆  -我什么都沒看到
- Can you grab him, Jim? - I don't see anything.

469
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,580
貝利
Bailey!

470
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,390
貝利  過來
Bailey, come here.

471
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,300
我覺得老鼠已經跑了
I think it's gone now.

472
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,160
我好討厭老鼠
Oh, I don't like rats!

473
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,840
貝利
Bailey!

474
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,380
什么情況
What was that?

475
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,260
赫爾曼
Herman!

476
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,480
貝利  過來
Bailey, come here!

477
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,030
快來  快點
Come here! Come on!

478
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,940
你抓到他了嗎  吉姆  抓到沒
You got him, Jim? You got him?

479
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,900
升職什么的再也不用想了
Any chances I had of a promotion, forget it.

480
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,560
爸爸  別這樣
Dad! Dad, stop!

481
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,660
-這不是它的錯  -你讓我們跟傻子一樣
- It's not his fault. It's... - You made us look like fools!

482
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,180
爸爸散發這個味道的時候說話總是很大聲
Dad always talked so loud when he smelled this way.

483
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:16,720
別懲罰他  都是我的錯
Don't punish him! My fault!

484
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,020
吉姆  你要不要先冷靜一下
Jim, why don't we take a moment before you...

485
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,550
不必了  從現在起  狗待在這里
No, from now on, he stays out here.

486
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,260
它什么也沒做
He didn't do anything!

487
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,780
我不想看到他
I do not want to see him.

488
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,420
別讓我在屋子里再見到他
I do not want to see him in the house.

489
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,330
可是外面冷
But it's cold outside.

490
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,190
他有毛的
Well, he's got fur for that.

491
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,130
我們至少得給他鋪個毯子吧
We should at least set out a blanket.

492
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,760
它只是條狗
It's a dog!

493
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,830
伊森
Ethan?

494
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,180
狗狗  你還好嗎
Hey, boy. Good?

495
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,020
真抱歉
I'm so sorry.

496
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,520
都是我的錯
It's all my fault.

497
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,400
盡管我看不到他
Even though I couldn't see him,

498
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,210
我知道伊森那晚很難過
I knew Ethan was very sad that night.

499
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,610
乖狗狗
Hey, boy.

500
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,240
外面太冷了  是吧
It's cold out there, isn't it?

501
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,750
我知道他需要我
I knew he needed me.

502
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,890
我也需要他
And I needed him, too.

503
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,750
真是條乖狗狗
You're a good boy.

504
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,580
準備好了嗎
Ready, boy?

505
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,060

00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,170
快來  貝利
Come on, Bailey.

508
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,730
好的  準備好了嗎
Okay, boy. Ready?

509
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,240

Three, two...

512
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,990
完美
Yeah, boy.

513
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,330
-別這樣  -我們再來一次
- Oh, come on. - Let's do it again.

514
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:11,220
-太棒了  -好
- Yes! - Yeah!

515
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,950
好球  伊森  傳得漂亮
Nice throw, Ethan. Nice throw.

516
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,000
打得好
Nice play.

517
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,710
伊森  傳得漂亮
Great pass, Ethan.

518
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,140
真厲害  棒極了
Got 'em now. Right on.

519
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,180
你  你每次都把球傳到他那個位置
You-you get it to him every time.

520
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,130
確實
Yeah, exactly.

521
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,310
因為每次我們用那種戰術的時候
'Cause every time we run that play...

522
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:28,500
所有人都想走在老大旁邊
Everybody wanted to walk next to the Alpha male.

523
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,540
是啊  我就是這個意思
Yeah, that's what I mean.

524
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,740
幾乎所有人
Almost everybody.

525
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,080
-因為每次他都正好在那個位置  -是的
- 'Cause he's right there every single time. - Yep.

526
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,740
-伊森  為什么你總是帶著這條狗  -什么
- Ethan, why do you always have this dog with you? - Hmm?

527
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,640
是用來替代女朋友的還是干嗎的
What? It's like a girlfriend replacement or something?

528
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,610
說得好  托德
Yeah, good one, Todd.

529
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,180
親一個
Give a little kiss? Huh?

530
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,310
我只是問問
I'm just asking.

531
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,840
不好意思
Excuse me.

532
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,810
我很抱歉  托德
Oh, I'm sorry, Todd.

533
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,780
剛才  是不是我的替補女朋友絆倒了你
Did my, uh, girlfriend replacement just trip you?

534
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,110
很好笑
Very funny.

535
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,840
放輕松  伙計  我就是開個玩笑
Relax, man. I'm kidding.

536
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,690
那只狗都在笑你
The dog's laughing at you.

537
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:56,490
-狗不會笑  你個白癡  -貝利  過來
- Dogs don't laugh, you moron. - Bailey, come here.

538
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,350
好好笑
That's funny.

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,500
-都拿好了嗎  -拿好了
- Got everything? - Yeah.

540
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,470
一開始盧傳那腳球的時候
When Lou dropped that pass at the start,

541
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,020
-我還以為我們死定了  -我就知道
- I thought we were done, man. - I know!

542

貝利  過來
Bailey, come here.

544
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,460
爸爸
Hey, dad.

545
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,250
-你餓了嗎  -餓死了
- You hungry? - I'm starving.

546
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,190
-微波爐里有一盆砂鍋菜  -這樣嗎
- I got a casserole in the oven. - Yeah?

547
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,270
非洲是成千上萬動物的家
Africa is home to hundreds of thousands of animals.

548
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,690
有些看起來很滑稽
Some look comical,

549
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,790
有些  有些讓人望而生畏
some... Some forbidding,

550
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,260
還有些使人著迷到
and some so entrancing that we'd like

551
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,130
讓人想伸開手  觸碰它們
to reach out and touch them...

552
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,280
教練今天讓我打四分衛了
So, uh, coach made me starting quarterback today.

553
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,600
孩子  真不錯
That's great, kid.

554
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,900
爸爸  你下次一定要來看我的比賽
You gotta come to my next game, dad.

555
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,720
我是認真的  我現在打得更好了
I'm serious. I'm better now.

556
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,310
你已經很久沒來看過了
It's been a long time.

557
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,970
好
Okay.

558
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,390
爸爸真可憐
Poor dad.

559
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,790
這地方太棒了
This place is great.

560
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,930
這兒有這么多好聞的
Oh, there's so much to smell here.

561
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,220
還有好吃的

562
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,960
到處都是
Oh, it's everywhere.

563
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,490
喂我  喂我
Feed me. Feed me.

564
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,140
你也想玩這個嗎
You want to go next?

565
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,460
伊森身上的味道突然不一樣了
Ethan had a different smell all of a sudden.

566
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,780
一股汗味
A sweaty smell.

567
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,510
有人想坐那個過山車嗎
Who wants to go on that roller coaster?

568
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:38,480
不知道這跟那個女孩兒有沒有關系
Hmm. I wonder if that girl had anything to do with it.

569
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:41,680
貝利貝利貝利貝利
Oh! Hey, hey, hey! Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey!

剛剛是那只狗  不是我

573
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,600
我不會做那種事的
I wouldn't do that.

574
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,050
或許
Okay, well, maybe

575
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,120
你該教狗懂點禮貌

是嗎
Really?

578
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,640
你聽到他剛剛說你什么了嗎
Wow. Did you hear what he said about you?

579
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,640
我看你長得挺聰明的

00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,290
我屁股有點癢
My butt itches.

583
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,100
帥哥  你叫什么
What's your name, handsome?

584
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,500

590
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,600
別讓他夠著那個
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Keep that away from him.

591
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,380
-好好好  -你真的很擅長這個
- Okay, okay, okay. - You're really good at that.

592
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,650
謝謝
Thanks.

593
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,940
-確實很好  -真的嗎
- Like, really good. - Yeah?

594
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,720
我剛剛在那邊看你來著
I was watching you over there.

595
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,560
不是那樣的
Not like that.

596
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,810
我是說
I mean... yeah.

597
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,680
再見
See ya.

598
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,210
如果我們以后不會再見面的話
Hey, uh, if we never speak again,

599
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,020
我想收回我之前的那句話
I just want to take back what I said before

600
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,950
我剛剛說我的狗不聰明
about my dog not being smart.

601
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,630
但他其實很聰明
He's actually really smart.

602
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,140
絕對比我聰明
Definitely smarter than me.

603
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,080
現在他們倆身上都有那種汗味了
Now they both had a sweaty smell.

604
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,890
你想去  你想去買個熱狗之類的嗎
You want to, uh... you want to get a hot dog or something?

605
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,300
爆米花呢
Popcorn?

606
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,010

00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:16,890
我想去救他們  但我不知道怎么救
I wanted to save them, but I didn't know how.

611
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,420

615
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,420
伊森有麻煩了
Uh-oh, Ethan's in trouble.

616

謝謝你  謝謝你們倆送我回來
Thank you. Thank you both for the ride.

625
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,490
我剛剛為什么要吃這么多熱狗
Why did I eat so many meat logs?

626
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,220
我們應該一起做些什么

629
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,790
是的
It was.

630
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,200
除了要買下28個熱狗  都很好
Except for having to pay for 28 hot dogs.

631
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,120
不好意思

634
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,430
從那時起
From that moment on,

635
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:29,020
這個女孩兒就成了我們的一員
the girl was a member of our pack.

636
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,400
我喜歡她
I liked her.

637
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,940
而且她聞起來像餅干的味道
Plus she smelled like biscuits.

638
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,040
去  去  貝利

- Come on. - Oh, good boy!

649
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:57,440
-真棒  真棒  -是啊  真棒
- Good boy. Good boy. - Yeah, good boy.

650
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,360
小心頭
Watch your head.

651
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,850
真棒
Good boy.

652
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,300
-不  這不可以  -不
- No, it's not okay. - No.

653
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,630
反正我也要走了
Besides, I'm going.

654
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,250
-為什么  -因為你從不聽我說話
- Why?  - You don't listen!

655
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,430
每次我問你那些東西去哪了的時候...
Every time I ask you where something comes from...

656
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,410
你告訴我  你告訴我那些東西去哪了
You tell me! You tell me where it's going!

657
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,970
因為是我掙來的  我掙來的  我掙來的
Cause I earn it! I earn it! I earn it!

658
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:19,190
要不我們去城里吧
You, uh... you want to go to town instead?

659
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,670
好的
Yeah.

660
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,440
-貝利  -走吧  貝利
- Bailey. - Come on, Bailey!

661
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,970
我們一起嚎叫
We howled together.

662
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,030
有時候我們就坐在車里
And sometimes we would sit in the car

663
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,150
哪里都不去
not even going anywhere.

664
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:58,270
伊森和漢娜會纏在一起舔對方
Ethan and Hannah would wrestle and lick each other.

665
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,180
他們是在搶食物嗎
Are they fighting over food?

666
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:06,450
也許漢娜在她嘴里藏了點什么
Maybe Hannah's hiding something in her mouth.

667
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,390
沒  什么也沒有
Nope. Nothing in there.

668
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,420
我的天...  你是怎么了
Oh, my... What's going on with you?

669
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,060
它喜歡你
Man, he loves you.

670
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,520
但是不管他
But no matter how much

671
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,560
多努力在那里找食物  他從沒找到過什么
he looked for food in there, he never found anything.

672
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,080
而且他
And he looked.

673
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,780
找了很多遍
A lot.

674
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,510
你能感覺的到
You can feel it.

675
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,920
夏天要結束了
Summer's ending.

676
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,320
是最好的夏天了
Best summer ever.

677
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,700
是的
Yeah.

678
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,800
我不想回學校
I don't want to go back to school.

679
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,020
你想的
Yes, you do.

680
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,540
我想
I do?

681
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,140
是的
Yes.

682
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,700
你會在一個好學校
You are gonna get a big football scholarship

683
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,240
得到一大筆橄欖球獎學金
at a good school.

684
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,610
我會申請那個學校
And then I'm gonna apply to that school

685
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,230
然后得到一筆學術獎學金
and get an academic scholarship.

686
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,080
我們都會上大學
And then we'll both be at college,

687
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,890
然后永遠不會分開
and we'll never be apart.

688
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,890
你把一切都計劃好了啊
You've got it all planned out, huh?

689
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,470
的確是的
Yes, indeed.

690
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,340
這是個好計劃
That's a good plan.

691
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,650
對吧  貝利
Right, Bailey?

692
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:15,140
什么  你說了什么
What? What did you say?

693
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,430

明天見
See you tomorrow.

696
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,690
真乖
Good boy.

697
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,460
我得走了
I gotta go.

698
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,310
你要去哪
Where are you going?

699
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,270
我要去喝點啤酒
I'm getting some beer.

700
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,670
我只是想讓你聲音放小一點
All I ask is for you to lower your voice.

701
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,430
-我就這點...  -別說了  別說了
- That's all I... - Stop, stop. Just stop!

702
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,700
你能小聲一點嗎
Will you please just keep it down?

703
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,140
我的父母就在樓下  吉姆  你別鬧了
My parents are upstairs, Jim. You need to stop.

704
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,830
好吧  對不起  你是對的
Oh, I'm sorry. You know, you're right.

705
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,650
好吧  那我就不鬧了
Fine. I will stop doing it, then.

706
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,370
我走行吧  我就直接走
I'll just go! I'll just leave.

707
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,050
你覺得這樣好嗎
Does that sound good to you?

708
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,120
-出來吧  -你覺得這樣好嗎
- Come on, boy. - Does it sound good to you?

709

媽媽  他得走了

他不能待在這了

743
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:18,480
媽媽  你沒事吧

伊森變成我們的頭了
Ethan was the leader of our pack.

750
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,980
當我們回家后  情況和之前不一樣了

那只貓躲了我好久
That cat had been hiding from me for a while.

753
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,720
現在我找到他了

754
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,560

761
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,630
猛虎隊奪得首攻

762
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,850
外接手接到傳球
Pass caught by wide receiver...

763
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,700

00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,500
我的天吶  真的嗎
Oh, my gosh! Really?

774
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:11,860

You wait here. I'll get you something to eat, okay?

778
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,980
知道啦
I just said okay.

779
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,430
乖狗狗
Good boy.

780
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,020
來吧  寶貝兒  燒起來
Come on, baby! Let it burn!

781
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,730
燒  燒  燒  好耶
Go, go, go, go, go! Yes!

782
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,560

- Ye... - What?

783
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,020
哈  跳梁小丑

他怎么來了
What was he doing here?

789
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,580
而且和往常一樣  心情很差
And in one of his bad moods, too.

790
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,180
我聞得出來
I could smell it.

791
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,620
走啦  快點
Come on, let's go.

792
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,120

是啊  但我還是沒拿到獎學金
Yeah, I didn't get a scholarship, though.

794
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,150
爸爸
Hey, dad.

795
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,950
兒子

799
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,170
是啊
Yeah.

800
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,780
投球投得不錯
You got a good arm.

801
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,240
順利被錄取了吧
So everything's going good, huh?

802
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,540
-這小子厲害吧  -爸爸

都為這小子歡呼吧
Let's cheer for this guy!

806
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:22,830
你能不能別這樣  爸爸
You don't have to do this right now, dad.

807
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,280
來吧  來吧
Come on! Come on, huh?

808
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,080
別這樣好嗎
Would you stop this?

809
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:29,730
好吧
Hey. All right.

810
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,370
好了  走吧
Come on, let's go.

811
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,740
給你漢堡
Want your burger?

812
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,160
是貝利的
For Bailey?

813
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,530
狗老大  真乖
Hey, boss dog. Good boy.

814
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,300
原來伊森的世界也并非十全十美啊
So it's not all perfect in Ethan land, huh?

815
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,280
難怪你要逃到密歇根去了
Now I know why you're going to Michigan, man.

816
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,880
想離你的酒鬼老爸遠點兒嗎
Get away from that alchy father of yours.

817
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,070
-你最好閉嘴  托德  -是嗎
- You should shut up, Todd. - Oh, yeah?

818
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,050
你  你不想讓所有人都知道
You-you don't want everyone here knowing

819
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,280
你老爸是個酒鬼嗎
that your father's a drunk?

820
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,930
伊森  我還得趕公交  走吧
Ethan, I have to catch my bus. Please.

821
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,190
顯然大家都知道了
It's pretty obvious.

822
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,570
-我們走吧  -好  一會兒就走
- Can we go? - Yeah, we're going soon.

823
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,770
他女朋友也開始心疼他了
Oh, oh, and his girlfriend's fighting his battles, too.

824
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,930
如果密歇根州大知道這樣的你...
If Michigan state knew the real Ethan...

825
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,070
天吶
Whoa!

826
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,570
我說過讓你閉嘴  托德
I told you to shut up, Todd.

827
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,010
我不喜歡這個味道
I don't like that smell.

828
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,880
我們上車吧
Please get in the car.

829
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,190
貝利  快點
Bailey, come on!

830
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,290
貝利  快過來  上車
Bailey, let's go. Get in the car.

831
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,440
什么聲音
What was that?

832
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,410
是松鼠嗎
Could that be that squirrel?

833
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,790
完美
Perfect.

834
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,600
托德闖進了我們的地盤
Todd was on our territory.

835
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,310
我真想咬他
Oh, I wanted to bite him.

836
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,180
但是伊森不讓我咬人
But I remembered Ethan telling me no biting.

837
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,230
不管了
Then I forgot.

838
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,880
停下  停下  別咬
No, no, no, no, no!

839
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,290
伊森
Ethan.

840
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,020
貝利
Bailey.

841
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,960
貝利  別吵
Bailey, shut up.

842
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,830
媽媽
Mom!

843
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,650
媽媽  媽媽
Mom, mom, mom!

844
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:25,660
快起來  醒醒
Get up, get up, get up.

845
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,290
快點  快點  起來
Quick, quick. Come on, quick!

846
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,580
-我們得出去  -不行  出不去了

911
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,260
我一整天都在烤東西
I've been baking all day.

912
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,040
你的房間都整理妥當了  伊森
Got your room all set up for you, Ethan.

913
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,690
你們來住這里真好
It's so good to have you here.

914
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,270
伊森再也不想玩了
Ethan never wanted to play anymore.

915
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,710
貝利
Oh, Bailey.

916
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:57,130
抱歉
I'm so sorry.

917
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,000
盡管他走到哪兒
Even though he carried

918
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,090
都帶著那根漂亮的新棍子
a great new stick everywhere he went.

919
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,630
貝利  不要
Bailey, come on. Hey!

別咬  別咬
Come on. Come on.

922
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,140
我再也請不動他和我玩了
I couldn't make him play with me.

923
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,970
他只想睡覺
All he wanted to do was sleep.

924
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:21,100
現在我的自由時間充裕  所以交了個新朋友
I had a lot of free time now, so I made a new friend.

925
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,240
它像只小馬
It was like a small horse.

926
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,810
或巨狗
Or a giant dog.

927
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,220
它身上有種獨特的氣味
With its own special smell

928
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,010
十分美妙又特別惡心
that was so wonderful and disgusting.

929
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:33,410
真希望我能進去打滾
Oh, I wished I could roll in it.

930
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:40,810
我們玩得超開心
Oh, we had fun.

931
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,550
直到它不高興了
Until we didn't.

932
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,540
至少漢娜仍會來玩
At least Hannah still came around.

933
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,800
貝利

00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,940
好狗狗  好狗狗
Good boy. Good boy.

937
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,120
真是一只好狗狗
Ah, you're such a good boy.

938
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,990
來  來
Come on. Come on!

939
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,930
你  你想去池塘那邊嗎
You, um... do you want to go to the pond?

940
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:13,000
我做了些三明治
I made some sandwiches.

941
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:14,990
好啊
Yeah.

942
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,160
我是說
I mean...

943
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,490
如果你想的話
Yeah, if you want.

944
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,820
我只是  想著如果我們離開屋子
I just... I thought it'd be nice

945
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:23,380
讓你出去轉轉  挺好的
if we could get out of the house, get you out.

946
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:32,650
怎么了
What?

947
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:35,100
漢娜  我知道你是好心
Look, Hannah, it's nice for you to try,

948
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,250
但是你不用  不用這樣做
but you don't have to... You don't have to do this.

949
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,390
你不用幫我
You don't have to help me.

950
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:43,280
我不是為了你
I'm not doing it for you.

951
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,560
是為了我們  我想
I'm doing it for us. I want...

952
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,690
不  你就是為了我才這么做的
No, you're doing this for me.

953
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:50,510
三周后你就去上大學了
You leave for college in three weeks.

954
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,550
但我隨時會回來的
But I'll be back all the time.

955
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:55,850
對  但我會待在這里
Uh-huh, and I'll be here.

956
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,240
拖著這條廢腿
With that.

957
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:02,030
你不能再自怨自艾了
You have to stop feeling sorry for yourself.

958
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,350
你不能為我這么做  漢娜
You can't do this for me, Hannah.

959
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,120
我愿意為你做任何事
I'd do anything for you.

960
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,010
我不認為我們應該繼續在一起了  漢娜
I don't think we should be with each other anymore, Hannah.

961
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,720
我們不該繼續在一起了
We shouldn't be with each other anymore.

962
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,260
不會有結果的
It's not gonna work.

963
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,210
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

964
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:28,310
你為什么要這樣
Why are you doing this?

965
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,630

伊森也想念他
Ethan missed her, too.

976
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,080
我能感覺到
I could tell.

977
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:41,400
伊森  我做了三明治
Ethan, I made you a sandwich.

978
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,190
放在后座上  好嗎

別悶悶不樂的  女士們
Don't look so glum, women.

984
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:54,540

988
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,610
走  過來
All right, go on. Come on.

989
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:02,970
最好牽住它
Better grab him.

990
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:04,070
它理解不了的
He's not gonna understand.

991
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:05,990
來這里
Come here.

992
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:07,270
-好狗狗  好狗狗  -你牽好狗了嗎
- Good boy. Good boy. - Have you got the dog?

993
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,360
我們到這里來
Let's come here.

994
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,780
-站住  貝利  站住  -過來  狗狗
- Stay, Bailey, stay. - Come on, boy.

995
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:14,950
天氣真好  是吧
Great day, huh?

996
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:19,940
它都長這么大了
He's so grown-up.

997
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:22,800
它在干嗎
What's he doing?

998
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:29,370
我的天
Oh, my goodness.

999
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:30,910
好狗狗  貝利
Good boy, Bailey.

1000
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:32,500
幫我保存它  好嗎  貝利
You keep that for me, okay, Bailey?

1001
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,310
-接住了  -是啊
- Caught it. - Yeah.

1002
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:37,190
再見  伊森
Bye, Ethan.

1003
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,200
一路順風
Drive safe.

1004
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:40,710
拜拜  伊森
See you, Ethan!

1005
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,730
不要  貝利
No, Bailey.

1006
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:50,050
-站住  -你牽住它  親愛的
- Stay. - You got him, honey?

1007
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:52,230
站住  我們玩接球呢
Stay? We're playing fetch.

1008
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:53,210
貝利
Bailey!

1009
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:55,960
我們已經很久沒一起玩了
It's been so long since we've played.

1010
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,020
貝利
Bailey.

1011
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,740
我喜歡這個新版本的接球游戲
I like this new version of fetch.

1012
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:41,540
你是不是瘋了  狗老大
You're crazy, you know that, boss dog?

1013
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,120
只是下次能不能...別開這么遠
Maybe not... Drive so far next time.

1014
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,190
幫我照看好這里的一切  好嗎
Take care of things around here for me, okay, boy?

1015
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:54,750
我很快就回來
I'll be back soon.

1016
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:56,330
答應我
Promise.

1017
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:03,680
好了  去吧  回家
Come on. Go on. Go home.

1018
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:12,920
人類很復雜
Humans are complicated.

1019
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:15,520
他們總做些狗狗不懂的事情
They do things dogs can't understand.

1020
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:17,350
比如離別
Like leave.

1021
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:22,020
伊森和我注定要在一起
Ethan and I were meant to be together.

1022
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:23,910
但如果伊森不在了
But if there was no Ethan,

1023
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:26,320
我活著還有什么意義
what was the point of my being here?

1024
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,360
也許意義就在于不要尋找意義
Maybe the point was not to look for a point.

1025
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:33,970
好了  等一下
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

1026
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:37,870
我很快回來  貝利
I'll be right back, Bailey.

1027
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,250
現在  一切都以緩慢的步調流逝
Everything moved at a slower pace now.

1028
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:43,940
沒關系
Which was okay,

1029
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:46,380
反正我也不想再跑了
because I never felt like running anymore.

1030
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:50,660
我經常覺得累
I was tired all the time.

1031
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:56,230
不再想著玩兒
I didn't feel like playing anymore.

1032
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:00,000
哪怕是跟小馬狗
Not even with horse-dog.

1033
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,890
貝利
Hey, Bailey.

1034
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:11,480
你還好嗎  孩子
Are you okay, boy?

1035
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,000
比爾
Bill?

1036
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:20,270
-小心點  當心... -好的
- Careful. Keep a... - Okay.

1037
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,110
它怎么了
Okay, let's see what we have here.

1038
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:25,830
它的眼睛看起來不大對勁
His eyes just didn't look right.

1039
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:28,260
有...有很多眼屎
They just, uh... they were... They were kind of rheumy.

1040
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,270
而且它...老是喘氣
And he... and he was panting, he was, uh...

1041
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:31,910
呼吸很沉重
His breathing was labored.

1042
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,650
它身上還起了個小腫塊
He's-he's also got this little lump in his, uh...

1043
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:36,470
對  它有沒有
Oh, yeah. Has he been drinking

1044
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:38,250
-大量喝水和尿尿  -沒有
- a lot of water and peeing? - No.

1045
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:40,440
昏昏欲睡  它...不太想出去散步了
Lethargic, so he... he doesn't want to go for walks anymore?

1046
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,470
我都不得不把它抱進車里
I had to carry him into the car.

1047
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:45,520
醫生  你覺得  我們能為它做點什么
What can we do for him, doctor? What do you think?

1048
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,100
我們...我們可以做個檢查
Well, we-we... We could do testing,

1049
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:52,050
但恐怕還是一樣的結果
but I'm afraid that it would probably be the same results.

1050
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,970
它的...它的腎功能在衰退
His... his kidneys are shutting down.

1051
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:56,010
我們能不能...
Can we just...

1052
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,520
大家都很難過
Everyone was so sad,

1053
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:00,480
但是我已經沒力氣去逗他們開心了
but I was too tired to cheer them up.

1054
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,000
喬伊斯醫生  我能不能借用下你電話
Dr. Joyce, can I, uh... Can I use your phone?

1055
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,020
當然可以
Yes. Oh, absolutely.

1056
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:06,360
醫生  醫生  如果這是個人
Doctor, doctor, uh, if this was a person,

1057
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,300
如果它是個人  你是獸醫
if this was a person... you're the veterinarian...

1058
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,730
如果它是個人  是不是意味著...
if this was a person, would you say that...

1059
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:18,490
你好
Uh, hello.

1060
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:20,650
我想找伊森
Yeah, uh, I'm looking for Ethan.

1061
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,180
我是他外公  比爾
It's his grandpa, Bill.

1062
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,880
伊森  我是外公
Ethan, it's grandpa.

1063
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,010
伊森
Ethan.

1064
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,080
你來了嗎
Are you here?

1065
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:31,960
我聞不到你
I can't smell you.

1066
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,690
你在哪兒
Where are you?

1067
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,190
貝利
Hey, Bailey.

1068
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,410
他來了
There he was.

1069
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,770
我知道他很難過
I could tell he was still sad.

1070
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,740
我不想讓他難過
I didn't want him to be sad.

1071
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,310
小笨狗
Doodle dog.

1072
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,010
狗老大
Boss dog, huh?

1073
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,490
我知道我來到這世上是為了愛伊森
I knew I was here to love Ethan

1074
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,280
讓他快樂
and make him happy.

1075
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,350
貝利  貝利  貝利  貝利
Oh, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.

1076
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:11,510
我不想就這樣離開他
I didn't want to leave him like this.

1077
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:16,330
乖孩子
Good boy.

1078
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,390
乖孩子  貝利
Good boy, Bailey.

1079
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:20,830
別擔心
Don't worry.

1080
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:23,840
他只會感覺到脖子上一丁點...小刺痛
He'll just feel a little... A little prick in his neck,

1081
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:26,670
然后就可以安息了
and then the pain will go away.

1082
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:42,210
一切又重新開始了
And then it happened again.

1083
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,380
媽媽  乳汁
The mother, the milk,

1084
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:46,520
舌頭  溫暖
the tongue, the warmth.

1085
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:47,930
我回來了
I was back.

1086
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,120
但為什么
But why?

1087
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,310
伊森去哪兒了
Where was Ethan?

1088
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:53,560
有些東西也不見了
Other things were missing, too.

1089
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,490
我怎么沒有...
I didn't have a...

1090
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,530
什么  我是個女孩
What? I'm a girl?

1091
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,240
過來  過來
Come on, come on!

1092
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,480
乖孩子  乖孩子
Good girl, good girl.

1093
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,870
我的主人很嚴肅
My man was very serious.

1094
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:04,750
注意
Look.

1095
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:08,050
-過  過  -我們工作很辛苦
- Over. Over. Good girl! - We worked hard.

1096
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:11,230
就算是玩  也被他搞得像在工作
Even when we played, he made it feel like work.

1097
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:13,410
放松  下  下
Easy. Down, down.

1098
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:15,950
找到沃利  搜尋開始
Find Wally. Search! Go!

1099
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:23,780
沃利真是讓人頭疼
Wally was a disaster,

1100
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,760
老在掉東西
always losing pieces of clothing.

1101
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:29,940
你找到他了
You found him.

1102
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,960
真棒
Good job. Okay.

1103
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:36,880
{\an8}埃莉  芝加哥警犬

1104
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:42,500
難道這就是我的使命
So this is my purpose?

1105
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,900
跟玩樂無關
It's not about fun.

1106
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,980
-跟伊森無關  -來  乖孩子
- It's not about Ethan. - Come on. Good girl.

1107
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,480
我的工作就是搜尋  查找
My job is to seek, find

1108
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,000
和展示
and show.

1109
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,760
真棒  乖孩子
Good job. Good job.

1110
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:03,030
但即使我做得很棒
But even when I did a good job,

1111
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,050
我的主人也還是不開心
my man was still sad.

1112
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,810
他很孤單
He was lonely.

1113
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:13,290
我知道曾經有人也住在這里
I could smell someone else used to live here,

1114
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:14,950
但他們的氣味很微弱
but their scent was faint.

1115
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:17,590
他們已經很久沒出現在這屋子里了
They hadn't been around in a long time.

1116
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,430
這時我開始意識到
That's when I realized

1117
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:24,890
世上最糟糕的事  莫過于孤單
being alone might be the worst thing that could happen to you.

1118
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:30,700
我知道想念一個人是什么感覺
I knew how it felt to miss someone.

1119
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,460
他也在想念某個人嗎
Did he miss someone, too?

1120
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:45,480
不可以
Stop that.

1121
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:48,880
怎么了
What?

1122
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,180
睡你自己的床  快去
Dog bed-- now.

1123
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:55,560
埃莉...
Ellie...

1124
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,320
睡自己的床  去
Dog bed-- now.

1125
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:03,660
為什么我要聽他的
Why did I listen to him?

1126
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,010
我不想走
I didn't want to go.

1127
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:09,170
而且我知道  他也不希望我走
And I could tell he didn't want me to go, either.

1128
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:14,140
天啊
Oh, gosh.

1129
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:19,220
能不能讓我省點心
Would you give me a break?

1130
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,850
不許發牢騷
No whining.

1131
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,330
這是槍
Gun.

1132
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:50,940
槍聞起來有股刺鼻的味道
Gun had a smell that stung my nose.

1133
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:52,860
乖乖的
Steady.

1134
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,230
坐好
Stay.

1135
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,520
放松

1136

習慣了就好了
Get used to it.

要堅強

1138
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:09,780
乖狗狗
Good girl.

1139
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:21,770

1140

那個我也會
I could do that, too.

1142
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:50,590
我找不到拒絕的理由
You know, I don't see why not.

1143
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,900
上來  上來
Come on. Come on.

1144

這是她昨天穿的毛衣
That's the sweater that she was wearing yesterday.

1145
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,280

1147

1148
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,000
我們接到了這里傭人的報案

1153
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,490
這是她在被綁架前一天穿過的衣服
This is the last item of clothing she was wearing.

1154
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:23,580

走吧  我們走
Come on. Come on.

1156
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:35,930
一位目擊者打電話稱
Got a partial plate called in

1157
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:38,250
有一輛藍色豐田正向東開向水庫

1191
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:06,070
這里是警犬K27
This is canine unit k-27.

1192
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:07,740
我需要立刻...

1193
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,280
支援

1194
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:12,390
我的狗中槍了
My dog's been shot.

1195
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:16,120
重復  警犬中槍
I repeat, canine shot.

1196
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,890
我一直討厭中槍
I always hated getting shots.

1197
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:24,460
這絕對是我受過的最重的槍傷

1198
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:25,460
埃莉
Ellie.

1199
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:27,560
你會沒事的
You're gonna be okay.

1200
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,750
你會沒事的
You're gonna be okay.

1201
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:36,570
你是條很棒的狗
You're a good dog.

1202
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:39,080
從卡洛斯的語氣中我能聽出
I could tell from Carlos's voice

1203
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,050
我干得不錯
I'd done a good job.

1204
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:46,440
你是條很棒的狗
You're a good dog.

1205
01:00:55,450 --> 01:00:57,100
我需要休息一下
I need to rest.

1206
01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:00,480
我能就在你的床上睡覺嗎
Can I just sleep in your bed?

1207
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,210
那是一種不同的生活
That was a different life.

1208
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:19,200
沒什么樂趣可言  真的
Not so much fun, really.

1209
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:22,210
但是我做得不錯
But I did good work.

1210
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:25,600
開始了
Here we go.

1211
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,560
現在我很小并且注意力集中
Now I'm tiny and all ears.

1212
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,370
你好啊  小可愛
Hi, you.

1213
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:35,850
你是這世界上最可愛的小狗狗嗎
Are you the cutest little puppy in the world?

1214
01:01:35,850 --> 01:01:37,210
她聞起來真香
She smelled good,

1215
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:38,920
像陽光和椒鹽卷餅的味道
like sunshine and pretzels.

1216
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,320
我覺得你是
I think you are.

1217
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:43,560
是嗎  你想和我一起回家  對嗎
Oh, yeah. You want to come home with me, huh?

1218
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:47,660
好了  你得和我一起回家
Okay, you gotta come home with me.

1219
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:49,650
你和我一起回家  好嗎
You gotta come home with me, huh?

1220
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:55,690
你想幫我嗎
Are you gonna help me with this?

1221
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,070
怎么了
What's happening?

1222
01:01:58,070 --> 01:01:59,860
你要去哪  過來
Where are you going? Come here.

1223
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:00,970
怎么了
What's going on?

1224
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:02,280
怎么了
What's going on, huh?

1225
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,790
我看得出來她很傷心
I could tell she was sad.

1226
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,300
我得哄她開心
I needed to cheer her up.

1227
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:21,990
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1228
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:23,460
我的尾巴呢
Where's my tail?

1229
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:25,390
咦  我的尾巴去哪了
Hello? Where's my tail?

1230
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:28,890
好了  狗狗  好了
Okay, boy. All right.

1231
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:30,810
快  快  咱們走
Come on. Come on, let's go.

1232
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:34,180
瑪雅去哪都帶著我
Everywhere she went, Maya brought me along.

1233
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,520
真是太棒了
Which was great.

1234
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,210
根據美國哲學家
According to the American philosopher

1235
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:38,990
查爾斯·桑德斯·皮爾士
Charles Sanders Peirce,

1236
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,560
人類只用符號思考
human beings think only in signs.

1237
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,760
她總是給我帶吃的
She always brought me something to eat.

1238
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,030
我都快忘了餓肚子的感覺了
I almost forgot what it was like to be hungry.

1239
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,290
幾乎
Well, almost.

1240
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:51,640
-你好  -你好

1241
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:54,570
-好可愛的狗  -謝謝
- Cute dog. - Uh-huh. Thanks.

1242
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:57,270
我們中的幾個
Um, listen, uh, a few of us

1243
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:59,060
準備組成一個學習小組

1244
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:00,650
我們準備在伍德福德自習室一起討論學習
We're meeting at the Woodford common room.

1245
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:02,590
我們希望你能加入
We'd love for you to join us.

1246
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:07,460
我很想去  但是我已經有安排了  所以...
Um, I would, but I have plans, so...

1247
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:11,050
但是我還沒說我們什么時候討論學習
Oh... oh, but I didn't say when we was meeting.

1248
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:12,200
不
No.

1249
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:14,250
不  我只是...  我很忙  我...
No, I just... I'm busy. I...

1250
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:15,810
我知道我會很忙...
Like, I know I'm gonna be busy and, like...

1251
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:17,380
我還得照顧我的狗  所以我...
I got my dog, so I gotta...

1252
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:18,870
謝謝你  我得走了
Thank you. I gotta go.

1253
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:20,370
我很抱歉  我得去遛狗了  所以...
I'm sorry. I have to take my dog out, so...

1254
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:21,900
-好吧  -但還是謝謝你
- Okay. - But thank you.

1255
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:22,870
好吧
Okay.

1256
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:26,330
-也許下次有機會再約  -好
- Maybe next time. - Uh, yeah.

1257
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:28,100
我不知道我是怎么了  蒂諾
I don't know what's wrong with me, Tino.

1258
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:31,370
或許多認識些人挺好的  但是...
Like, yeah, maybe it would be nice to meet people, but...

1259
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,230
不  我也該一個人學習因為...
No, also I should just study alone 'cause...

1260
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:35,000
慢著點  慢著點
Slow down. Slow down.

1261
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,050
我只有小短腿
My legs are barely even legs.

1262
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:38,430
我覺得自己真蠢
Ugh! I feel like such an idiot.

1263
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:41,290
我很快明白了  雖然瑪雅總是在說話
I learned quickly that even though Maya talked all the time,

1264
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:43,460
她很像卡洛斯
she was a lot like Carlos.

1265
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:45,430
我們的小團體里沒有別人了
There was no one else in our pack.

1266
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,050
只有瑪雅和我
Just Maya and me.

1267
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,780
但我開始懂她了
But I'm starting to get her.

1268
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,990
事實上  我能讀她的心
Actually, I can read her mind.

1269
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:53,360
你知道我在想什么嗎
You know what I'm thinking?

1270
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:56,410
-薯條  -薯條
- Chips. - Chips.

1271
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:02,020
你知道我在想什么嗎
You know what I'm thinking?

1272
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:04,680
-披薩  -披薩
- Pizza. - Pizza.

1273
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,750
一定要是披薩啊
Please. Pizza.

1274
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,360
-嗨  克里斯  -嗨
- Hey, Chris. - Hi.

1275
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:11,920
-給你 謝謝  -拜拜
- Here you go. - Thank you. Bye.

1276
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:14,630
-你準備好了嗎  -我準備好了
- You ready? - I am ready.

1277
01:04:16,850 --> 01:04:18,080
你知道我在想什么嗎
You know what I'm thinking?

1278
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,110
冰淇淋
Ice cream.

1279
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:20,940
這可能有些可笑  但有時
It's ridiculous, but sometimes

1280
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,760
我真的覺得你知道我在想什么
I actually think you know what I'm thinking.

1281
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,500
冰淇淋  冰淇淋  冰淇淋
Ice cream, ice cream, ice cream.

1282
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:27,120
你知道嗎  我一個人待的時間太長了
Ugh. Do you know, I'm spending way too much time alone.

1283
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,250
你想吃點冰淇淋嗎
You want to go get some ice cream?

1284
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,060
你懂我
You read my mind.

1285
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:35,500
我覺得可能就這樣了  蒂諾
I think this is it, Tino.

1286
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,440
我覺得我們只能相依為命了
I think it's just gonna be you and me.

1287
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:43,390
我不知道  這也挺好的  對嗎
I-I don't know. It's fine, right?

1288
01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:47,230
因為我愛你  你也愛我
Because I love you and you love me, and...

1289
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,500
唯一重要的就是愛
Love is all that matters.

1290
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:53,630
從哪兒得到的愛并不重要
It's not like it matters where you get your love.

1291
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:57,280
只要有東西愛你  對嗎
As long as something loves you, right?

1292
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,670
我能再來點嗎
Can I have some more?

1293
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,850
你真貼心
Oh, you're so sweet.

1294
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,990
你真可愛
You're so cute.

1295
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:12,280
我愛你
Hi. I love you.

1296
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:15,300
你為什么就不能是我男友呢
Why can't you be my boyfriend, huh?

1297
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,230
你為什么就不能再給我點冰淇淋呢
Why can't you give me more ice cream?

1298
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,110
還剩一針
--Okay, one more to go.

1299
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:22,460
這些穿白大褂的人類
What's with these white-coat people

1300
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,090
干嗎總是用尖東西扎我
sticking me with sharp things?

1301
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:25,950
你按時喂他嗎
Now, do you feed him at regular times?

1302
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:27,840
挺有規律的
Pretty regular.

1303
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:29,520
你都給他吃什么
What do you give him?

1304
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:30,960
吃的
Food.

1305
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:32,270
狗糧  怎么了
Dog food. What?

1306
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,940
或許你應該讓他多鍛煉些
Maybe give him more exercise.

1307
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:36,640
多遛遛
Go on more walks.

1308
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,470
沒問題
Sure.

1309
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:40,650
扎針  我討厭扎針
Shots. I hate those shots.

1310
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,510
好了  蒂諾
Okay, Tino.

1311
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:43,250
我們來做運動吧
Let's do this, huh?

1312
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:44,810
這是醫囑  過來吧
Doctor's orders. Come here.

1313
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:46,710
好了  撿球去
All right, get the ball.

1314
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,690
走了那么久  現在我又得撿球去
A long walk, and now I have to chase a ball?

1315
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:51,280
把球撿回來  快點
Get the ball. Come on.

1316
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:53,010
我為什么被這般懲罰
Why was I being punished like this?

1317
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:53,870
蒂諾  快點  你是只狗
Tino, come on. You're a dog.

1318
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:55,670
追球去  快去追
Get... chase the ball. Chase it.

1319
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:57,960
-快點  蒂諾  -幸運兒
- Come on, Tino. - Lucky.

1320
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,240
蒂諾  這真是太丟人了  好嗎
Tino, this is embarrassing, okay?

1321
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,180
-快去吧  -對不起  今天不行
- Just, come on. - Sorry, not today.

1322
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:03,940
-撿球去  -我沒那心情
- Get the ball. - I'm not in the mood.

1323
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,920
之后我看見了她
And then I saw her.

1324
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,630
一切都變了
And everything changed.

1325
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:12,800
我的心激動起來
My heart was aflutter.

1326
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:21,230
抓得真棒
What a catch.

1327
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:30,080
蒂諾  把它帶回給我
Tino, bring it back to me.

1328
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:37,020
你也與我感同身受嗎
Are you feeling what I'm feeling?

1329
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:38,550
對不起
Hey, I'm sorry.

1330
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,350
我的狗今天怪怪的
My dog's acting so weird today.

1331
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:42,130
-不  沒事的  -我們走吧
- No, it's okay. - Come on, boy. Let's go.

1332
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:43,820
快點  你想追這個嗎
Come on, are you gonna chase this?

1333
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,560
-等一下  -你好
- Wait a minute. - Oh. Hey.

1334
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:49,420
你和我都上肯特教授的課
You and I both have, uh, Professor Kenter.

1335
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:50,870
是啊
Right. Yeah.

1336
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:54,910
我叫艾爾
I'm-I'm Al.

1337
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:56,170
好的  我叫瑪雅
Oh. Okay, I'm Maya.

1338
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,890
-很高興認識你  -我很抱歉
- Nice to meet you. - I'm sorry...

1339
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:00,540
瑪雅在說著話  但我不在聽
Maya was talking, but I didn't listen.

1340
01:07:00,590 --> 01:07:02,460
我腦子里都是她
All I could think of was her.

1341
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:03,590
沒事的  我理解的
It's cool. I... No, I, understand.

1342
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:05,400
它一遇到你的狗就像瘋了似的
So he's, like, acting crazy around your dog.

1343
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:09,810
干嗎不肯呢
Why fight it?

1344
01:07:09,970 --> 01:07:11,770
我們聞起來好配
We smell great together.

1345
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:19,530
我們開始天天都能見到羅西
We started seeing Roxy all the time.

1346
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:22,800
不知為什么  艾爾也總是會來
For some reason, Al always came, too.

1347
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:25,800
沒過多久
It wasn't long before...

1348
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,340
我們就睡在一起了
We slept together.

1349
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,710
我真的開始懂了
I'm really starting to get it now.

1350
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:38,610
如果活著有意義  羅西就是那個意義
If there's a point, Roxy is the point.

1351
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,790
慢著  出什么事了
Wait. What's going on?

1352
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:45,970
瑪雅
Um, Maya?

1353
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:48,310
我心里有些話
There's been something on my mind

1354
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:50,200
一直想告訴你
that I've been wanting to talk to you about.

1355
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:53,200
我記得那個汗濕的氣味
Oh, I recognize that sweaty smell.

1356
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,470
我們已經在一起一段時間了
We've been together for a while now.

1357
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:04,640
瑪雅  我想讓你成為我的妻子
--Maya, I want you to be my wife.

1358
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,850
-艾爾  我的天哪  -事情不太對勁
- Al! Oh, my god! - Something's wrong here.

1359
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:07,740
-我愿意  -瑪雅有危險
- Yes! - Maya's in trouble.

1360
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:09,990
我愿意  過來
Yes! Yay! Come here!

1361
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:12,300
-親愛的  我愿意  -太棒了
- Oh, honey, yes! - Yeah.

1362
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:14,710
這兒有危險  躲到我身后  羅西
There is danger. Get behind me, Roxy.

1363
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,360
我會保護大家的
I'll protect us all!

1364
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:18,640
艾爾
Al!

1365
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:20,760
我牽住蒂諾了
Okay. I got Tino. I got Tino. I got Tino.

1366
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,550
等一下等一下
Okay, wait, wait. Hold on!

1367
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,450
不  羅西  別這樣
No, Roxy. Stop it!

1368
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:29,630
媽媽  拿一下這些花
Okay. Mom, hold the... Hold these.

1369
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:31,840
好了  過來吧
Okay, come here. Come on.

1370
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:34,330
-我覺得我們準備好了  -我們開始吧  
- I think we're ready. - Okay, let's do this.

1371
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:35,410
完美
Okay, perfect.

1372
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:37,150
準備好
Ready.

1373
01:08:38,970 --> 01:08:41,150
你很嫉妒因為法倫有了孩子
You're jealous because Fallon's had her baby,

1374
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:43,340
這使得你更偏執多疑了
and that's made you even more paranoid.

1375
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:45,660
亞歷克西斯會被揍的
Alexis gonna get her butt whupped

1376
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:47,140
-要是她還這么口無遮攔  -是吧
- she keep running off the mouth like that. - Right?

1377
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:49,180
因為克里斯塔爾再也受不了這事了
'Cause Krystle's not gonna take much more of this.

1378
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:51,770
-我沒有  -這太瘋狂了
- I haven't. - This is crazy.

1379
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:53,290
我給你說了吧  我給你說了吧
I told you. I told you.

1380
01:08:53,290 --> 01:08:55,190
我的天啊
Oh, my gosh.

1381
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,850
-什么  -打她  克里斯塔爾
- What? - Oh, get her, Krystle.

1382
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,710
我的天啊
Oh, my gosh.

1383
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:01,220
她的肚子里是什么聲音
What's all that noise in her stomach?

1384
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:03,650
是她吃的東西的聲音嗎
Was it something she ate?

1385
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:06,870
她們要殺了對方啊
Yo, they're trying to kill each other.

1386
01:09:08,070 --> 01:09:09,190
什么
What?

1387
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:11,800
不
Oh, no.

1388
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:16,040
-這是一個寶寶  -她在呼吸嗎
- It was a baby. - Is she breathing?

1389
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:17,020
你要放松點  親愛的
You gotta relax, honey.

1390
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:18,910
她在呼吸呢  好吧
She's breathing, okay?

1391
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:20,980
也許我們應該叫醒她來確認一下
Uh, maybe we should wake her up just to be sure.

1392
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:23,510
我不明白為什么他們要生個寶寶
I didn't understand why they got a baby.

1393
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,270
這把他們的注意力都轉移走了
It took all their attention.

1394
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,420
幸好羅西和我有所需的一切
Good thing roxy and I already had everything we needed.

1395
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:30,420
我們彼此
Each other.

1396
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:31,910
小寶寶
Hey, baby.

1397
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:33,920
后來他們生了更多的寶寶
Then they went and got more babies.

1398
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:36,220
看上去像是我的錯
Seemed like a mistake to me.

1399
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:39,480
不久  我必須過著逃跑的生活了
Soon, I had to live my life on the run.

1400
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:41,260
找到他了
Found him!

1401
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,040
無處可逃
There was no escape.

1402
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:48,130
我允許他們對我為所欲為
I let them do what they wanted to me.

1403
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:53,050
我愿意做任何事情以便羅西可以安全
I'd do anything so that roxy could be safe.

1404
01:09:54,030 --> 01:09:57,340
那是我的使命  隨時保護她
That was my mission: To protect her at all times.

1405
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:03,890
我想  說實話
I guess, if I was really honest,

1406
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,700
我喜歡得到所有的關注
I liked all the attention.

1407
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:16,910
隨著羅西和我漸漸變老
As roxy and I got older,

1408
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,290
我們的關系更加穩固了
our connection grew stronger.

1409
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:23,520
她也一直如我們初見時
And she never lost the spark

1410
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,020
耀眼迷人
that drew me to her in the first place.

1411
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:30,620
有一天  羅西去看獸醫了
One day, roxy went to the vet.

1412
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:33,970
她就再也沒有回來過
And she never came back.

1413
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,410
看我  看我
Look at me! Look at me!

1414
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:41,160
每個人對我都很好
Everyone was good to me.

1415
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,170
但隨著歲月的流逝  我很想念羅西
But as the years went by, I missed Roxy.

1416
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:49,230
沒有她一切都不一樣了
It just wasn't the same without her.

1417
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:02,640
蒂諾
Hey, tino.

1418
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:11,400
蒂諾
Hey, Tino.

1419
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:14,700
你知道我在想什么嗎
You know what I'm thinking?

1420
01:11:14,990 --> 01:11:15,960
是的
Yes.

1421
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,740
我知道你在想什么
I know what you're thinking.

1422
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:19,040
披薩
Pizza.

1423
01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:23,740
不是嗎
No?

1424
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:26,940
不是披薩嗎
No pizza?

1425
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:28,790
我不餓
I'm not hungry.

1426
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:31,660
好吧
Okay.

1427
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:35,220
蒂諾...
Tino...

1428
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,270
你在想什么呢
What are you thinking?

1429
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:49,780
你在想什么呢
What are you thinking?

1430
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,770
蒂諾  你在想什么呢
Tino, what are you thinking?

1431
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:56,610
我在想我準備好了
I'm thinking I'm ready.

1432
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,190
這真的是我最美好的生活之一
One of my best lives, really.

1433
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:14,250
我回來了
I'm back.

1434
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:15,310
又一次
Again.

1435
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:17,590
但是為什么呢
But why?

1436
01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:24,850
-小狗想要只小狗嗎  -你好啊  小朋友
- Puppies! Want a puppy? - Hey there, little fella.

1437
01:12:24,850 --> 01:12:26,530
-賣小狗了  -想買一只嗎
- Puppies for sale! - Want to buy one?

1438
01:12:26,530 --> 01:12:28,450
有想買小狗的嗎
Who wants a puppy?

1439
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:30,140
你好啊
Hi!

1440
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:34,350
我們又開始新生活了
Here we go again.

1441
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:35,930
看看我抱的是什么
Look what I got. Huh?

1442
01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:37,450
我看到了
Yeah, I am looking.

1443
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:38,930
看他多可愛啊
Look how cute he is.

1444
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:40,180
你太不理智了
You know, it's-it's crazy.

1445
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:41,860
誰來照顧他
Who's gonna take care of him?

1446
01:12:42,130 --> 01:12:43,390
我會的
I will.

1447
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:45,570
好了  我給他取名華夫餅
Come on. I named him waffles.

1448
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:46,870
不準進屋
Not inside.

1449
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:06,880
吃吧
Come on.

1450
01:13:11,570 --> 01:13:14,190
我一直告訴她你會越長越大
I kept telling her you were going to get bigger.

1451
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,650
所以她現在不太喜歡你了  對吧
Not so into you now, is she?

1452
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,510
我哪里都沒有去過
I never went anywhere.

1453
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:21,940
我從未玩耍過
I never played.

1454
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:25,820
感覺就像沒有我日子也會一天天過去
It was like the days went on and on without me.

1455
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:29,210
你有三十天的時間來處理掉這個
You have 30 days to deal with this.

1456
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:30,430
當警察來的時候
When the officer came,

1457
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:33,260
我以為又是要領我去參加找東西表演
I thought it was to take me to do find-and-show.

1458
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:35,390
但她自己走了
But she left without me.

1459
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:36,810
他很臟  我們要把他趕走
He's dirty. We're getting rid of him.

1460
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:38,540
我們不能把狗趕走
We are not going to get rid of that dog.

1461
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:40,160
夠了  我們要把他趕走
That's enough! We're getting rid of him.

1462
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:43,020
我把他帶回來的  我們要照顧好他
I took him in here, and we're gonna take care of him.

1463
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:55,950
你保證可以給他找個好家庭  是嗎
You'll make sure he finds a nice home, right?

1464
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,590
一個負責任的人
Somebody responsible?

1465
01:13:57,850 --> 01:13:58,680
是的
Yeah.

1466
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:10,170
快來  出來
Come on. Out.

1467
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:11,320
動起來
Move it.

1468
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:13,010
我們走  快來
Let's go. Come on.

1469
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,290
動起來
Move.

1470
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:23,340
再見  小狗
So long, doggie.

1471
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:35,940
現在我應該走回家嗎
Now I'm supposed to walk home?

1472
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:38,300
這似乎太不公平了
That didn't seem very fair.

1473
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,720
但當我好好考慮后
But when I thought about it,

1474
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,820
我不想回到那個家了
I didn't want to go back to that home.

1475
01:14:51,710 --> 01:14:53,040
快來  來這里
Come on. Over here.

1476
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,320
看  媽媽
Look, mom.

1477
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,030
看起來很有趣
That looks like fun.

1478
01:14:57,030 --> 01:14:59,290
坐  坐  你喜歡那個嗎
Sit. Sit. You like that?

1479
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,820
已經很久沒有開心玩耍了
It's been so long since I've had fun.

1480
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:04,580
她要去哪里
Where is she going?

1481
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,290
我認識你嗎
Do I know you?

1482
01:15:11,150 --> 01:15:13,320
你身上有些東西
There's something about you.

1483
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:16,690
是...你的味道
It's... your smell.

1484
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,030
你有點臟臟的
You're a scruffy one.

1485
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:20,940
你迷路了嗎
Are you lost?

1486
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:22,650
你從哪里來的
Where are you from?

1487
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:26,000
你有頸圈嗎
You got a collar?

1488
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:28,740
我知道那個味道
I know that smell.

1489
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,380
別害怕
Don't be afraid.

1490
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:34,500
那是...在很久以前
It's... from a long time ago.

1491
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:07,600
我之前來過這里嗎
Had I been here before?

1492
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:11,540
真開心我能離開城市
I was so happy to leave the town behind.

1493
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,550
我鼻子充滿了清新的味道
My nose was full of fresh new smells.

1494
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:23,350
這里有個味道你永不會忘記
And then there are the smells you never forget.

1495
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:26,640
火車  苔蘚
Train. Moss.

1496
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:29,450
樹木  馬  垃圾
Trees. Horse. Garbage.

1497
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,180
是小馬狗
It was horse-dog!

1498
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:00,520
會是一樣的嗎
Could it be the same?

1499
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:04,080
是一樣的耶
Ah, it was the same.

1500
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:06,940
那是不是意味著伊森也曾在這
Could it mean Ethan was here, too?

1501
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:10,610
那應該夠我們撐到月底
That ought to cover us to the end of the month.

1502
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:11,660
伊森
Ethan?

1503
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:14,870
不可能是他
That can't be him.

1504
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:17,800
告訴弗雷德我會去鎮里
Tell Fred that I will be in town...

1505
01:17:17,890 --> 01:17:18,830
是他嗎
Is that him?

1506
01:17:18,830 --> 01:17:20,380
明日去結賬好嗎
...tomorrow to settle up, okay?

1507
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:21,210
會跟他說的
Will do.

1508
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:23,080
是他
It is him!

1509
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:25,510
是他  太棒了
It's him! Yes!

1510
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:27,060
太棒了  是他
Yes, it's him!

1511
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:34,310
是我啊
It's me!

1512
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:36,610
狗老大  貝利貝利貝利
Boss dog! Bailey, Bailey, Bailey

1513
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:37,550
你的傻狗狗
doodle dog!

1514
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:39,410
你從哪來的
Where'd you come from?

1515
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:42,900
經過了這么世  我真的找到你了
After all these lives, I'd actually found him.

1516
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:44,300
我找到了伊森
I found Ethan.

1517
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:48,930
我敢打賭你餓了
I'm gonna make a bet you're hungry.

1518
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:52,020
吃吧
Here you go.

1519
01:17:56,690 --> 01:17:57,640
看來是真餓壞了
You must be.

1520
01:17:58,020 --> 01:17:59,420
沒有人喜歡我煮的東西
Nobody likes my cooking.

1521
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:10,920
不要這樣看著我
Don't look at me like that.

1522
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:14,400
你不能留在這
You can't stay here.

1523
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:16,640
你得回家去
You gotta go home.

1524
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:17,720
你有主人
You belong to somebody.

1525
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:19,860
家  對啊
Home. Yes.

1526
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:20,780
對  我回家了
Yes, I'm home.

1527
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:23,490
回家吧  狗狗
Go home, dog.

1528
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:29,560
回家吧
Go home.

1529
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:46,890
你是一條固執的狗狗  是嗎
You're a stubborn one, aren't you?

1530
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:55,590
然后  周二晚間
Then, Tuesday night,

1531
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:57,610
降雨量為76毫米
we got three tenths of an inch of rain.

1532
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:11,370
確保它能找個好家
Be sure he gets a good home.

1533
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:12,870
它是一條好狗
He's a good dog.

1534
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:14,300
當然
Sure.

1535
01:19:15,170 --> 01:19:16,840
不不不  不要把我留在這
No. No, don't leave me here.

1536
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:19,260
這里是收容站
This is a white-coat place.

1537
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:20,840
我是你的
I belong with you.

1538
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:24,920
再見  狗狗
So long, dog.

1539
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:14,330
你想要離開這嗎
You want to get out of here?

1540
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:18,880
你想走嗎
Do you want to go?

1541
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:20,270
來吧  我們走
Come on, let's go.

1542
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,910
我又坐回了前排
I was back in the front seat.

1543
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:26,370
小家伙
Okay, buddy.

1544
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,260
看來我們倆要相依為命了
Guess it's gonna be you and me.

1545
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,410
還有那頭驢
And the donkey.

1546
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:33,730
驢是什么
What's a donkey?

1547
01:20:36,230 --> 01:20:38,400
你上一次洗澡是什么時候
Now, when was the last time you got a bath?

1548
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:40,740
真是條乖狗
That's a good boy.

1549
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:44,230
洗好了
There you go. All right.

1550
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:46,010
爬出去  我們走
Just step out. Out. Let's go!

1551
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:48,920
干的好
There you go.

1552
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:56,410
{\an8}巴蒂

1553
01:20:58,010 --> 01:20:59,390
你會得到一個新的項圈
You're getting a new collar.

1554
01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:03,520
看起來它可沒有少吃
Doesn't look like he's missed too many meals.

1555
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,760
-它體型很好  -嗯  是條好狗
- He's in good shape. - Yeah, he's a good boy.

1556
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:06,750
是不是啊
Aren't you, huh?

1557
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:14,640
但伊森似乎還是很傷心
But Ethan still seemed sad.

1558
01:21:16,190 --> 01:21:18,400
也許是因為他一個人睡
Maybe it was because he slept alone.

1559
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:22,740
我想要幫他  可我不知道如何幫
I wanted to help him, but I didn't know how.

1560
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,480
等等  等等
Wait. Wait.

1561
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:28,300
等一下
Hold that thought.

1562
01:21:32,350 --> 01:21:34,310
貝利  就這么辦
Okay, Bailey, let's do this.

1563
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:35,370
快點
Hurry.

1564
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:36,680
快快快快快
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

1565
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:38,850
就是這兒了
This is the place.

1566
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:41,210
我在找...
I'm looking for...

1567
01:21:45,130 --> 01:21:46,770
快  卡莉  到這來  寶貝
Come on, Carly. Come here, girl.

1568
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:48,810
-過來  卡莉  -過來吧  卡莉
- Come on, Carly. - Come on, Carly.

1569
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:50,190
快來  卡莉
Come here, Carly.

1570
01:21:51,650 --> 01:21:52,660
能幫我開下門嗎
Can you get the gate for me?

1571
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:54,790
-好的  媽媽  -謝謝
- Yes, mommy. - Thank you.

1572
01:21:55,670 --> 01:21:56,720
乖狗狗
Good girl.

1573
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:05,690
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

1574
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:08,210
瑞秋
Rach.

1575
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:11,640
快看  威爾
Oh, hey. Look, Will.

1576
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:12,710
-外婆來了  -外婆
- Grandma's here. - Hi, grandma.

1577
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:14,000
那又有那種氣味了
There's that smell again.

1578
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
-最近感覺怎么樣  -挺好的
- How are you feeling? - I'm pretty good.

1579
01:22:16,810 --> 01:22:18,110
真是個驚喜
This is a surprise.

1580
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:20,460
現在更濃了
It's stronger now.

1581
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:22,320
我覺得我該給你們準備些吃的了
I thought I'd bring you some groceries.

1582
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,080
-是漢娜  -謝謝
- It's Hannah! - Aw. Hmm, thanks.

1583
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:25,700
你還在這
You're still here?

1584
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:27,820
雖然你看起來不一樣了
Oh, you look different.

1585
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:30,770
但聞起來還像餅干一樣
But you still smell like biscuits.

1586
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:36,080
這是誰的狗
Who is this?

1587
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:39,520
公園里的流浪狗
It's the, uh, stray from the park.

1588
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:42,400
流浪狗  真的嗎
A stray? Really?

1589
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:46,730
你好哇
Well, hello there.

1590
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:49,060
多好一條狗啊
What a good dog.

1591
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:51,550
它肯定不是流浪狗
Well, he's certainly not a stray,

1592
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:53,610
因為它有項圈
'cause he's got a collar.

1593
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:54,430
讓我看看
Let's see.

1594
01:22:55,450 --> 01:22:56,690
它的名字是巴蒂
His name is Buddy.

1595
01:22:57,570 --> 01:22:59,120
看看  它的主人是
Let's see. He belongs to...

1596
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:02,450
{\an8}伊森·蒙哥馬利

1597
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:08,510
出來啊  伊森
Come on, Ethan.

1598
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,400
我能聞出來你在里面
I can smell you in there.

1599
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:13,370
我不想把你留在這
I don't want to leave you here.

1600
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:16,220
但我想他應該不在家
But I guess he's not home.

1601
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:36,790
嗨  伊森
Hi, Ethan.

1602
01:24:39,570 --> 01:24:40,400
嗨  漢娜
Hi, Hannah.

1603
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,350
我把你的狗帶回來了
I brought your dog home.

1604
01:24:56,370 --> 01:24:57,450
你一定過的很辛苦吧
Must have been tough on you,

1605
01:24:57,970 --> 01:24:59,860
多年前就失去了丈夫
losing your husband after all those years.

1606
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:03,050
嗯  所以我格外想念我的女兒
Yeah, it made me miss my daughter a lot.

1607
01:25:05,030 --> 01:25:06,180
然后  隨著孫子的出生
And then, with the new baby coming,

1608
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:10,570
我覺得瑞秋和米格爾真的很需要幫手
I thought Rachel and Miguel could really use the help.

1609
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:11,610
嗯
Yeah.

1610
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:13,760
你要在這待多久啊
How long you get to stay for?

1611
01:25:16,230 --> 01:25:18,150
我不是來探親的  伊森
Uh, well, I'm... I'm not visiting, Ethan.

1612
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:20,230
大概一個月前我就搬回來住了
I moved back about a month ago.

1613
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:22,240
你搬了嗎
Y-you did?

1614
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:24,470
歡迎回家
Welcome home.

1615
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:26,880
謝謝
Thanks.

1616
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:33,480
這個地方還跟以前一樣
Well, this place is still the same.

1617
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:34,770
對啊
Yeah.

1618
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:35,890
加油啊
Oh, come on.

1619
01:25:37,450 --> 01:25:38,490
那你呢
So, what about you?

1620
01:25:38,490 --> 01:25:41,250
你  你就再沒遇上某個人或
You... you never met anyone or...

1621
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:43,090
找不到對的人
Never found the right fit.

1622
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:47,570
我真的很固執
I'm really stubborn.

1623
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:48,880
這點我知道
I know that.

1624
01:25:49,630 --> 01:25:51,820
當你把心思投入到一件事中  就是那樣
When you put your mind to something, that was that.

1625
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:53,690
是的
Yeah.

1626
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:55,950
這樣有助于把事情搞定
That's good for getting things done.

1627
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:57,910
但是不利于發展感情
It's not so good for relationships.

1628
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:01,830
好吧
Okay, well...

1629
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:05,060
好吧  就這樣
Okay, here we go.

1630
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:06,740
它們會互相舔臉
They're gonna lick faces.

1631
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:09,720
這樣非常好
Well, look, this was really nice.

1632
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:10,960
我得走了
I gotta go.

1633
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:12,800
謝謝你  伊森
Thank you, Ethan.

1634
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:14,560
等一下  什么
Wait, what?

1635
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:16,280
拜托
Oh, come on!

1636
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:18,260
謝謝你把我的狗帶回來
Hey, thanks for bringing back my dog.

1637
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:20,510
不客氣  再見
You're welcome. Bye.

1638
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:24,680
漢娜
Hey, Hannah.

1639
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:29,960
我...
I, uh...

1640
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:33,800
我欠你一句道歉
I owe you an apology.

1641
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:36,280
為我們之間發生的事情道歉
For what happened to us.

1642
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:38,050
以前的事
Back then.

1643
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:40,500
別擔心
Well, don't worry.

1644
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,510
那是很久很久以前了
It was a long, long time ago.

1645
01:26:42,510 --> 01:26:43,240
不
No.

1646
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:44,200
我把你推開了
I pushed you away.

1647
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:47,850
而且我那時對這個世界真的很憤怒
And I was... I was really mad at the world.

1648
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:50,510
我只是想讓你知道
And I just want you to know that not a day goes by

1649
01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:55,750
我每一天都在為那樣做后悔
that I don't kick myself for doing that.

1650
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:58,560
這就是那種流汗的味道
There's that sweaty smell.

1651
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:01,060
你覺得
You think, uh,

1652
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:04,330
如果我們一起做點什么
it'd be crazy if...

1653
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:09,750
是件瘋狂的事嗎
we did something together?

1654
01:27:11,710 --> 01:27:13,520
你是想跟我約會嗎
Are you asking me out on a date?

1655
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:18,130
我只是覺得如果我就看著你開車走了
Well, I just think that I'd be an all-time fool

1656
01:27:18,130 --> 01:27:21,280
那我就是個大大的白癡
if I just watched you drive away.

1657
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:25,130
別說話了  快用鼻子吧
Enough talking. Use your nose.

1658
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:26,020
不要
Then don't.

1659
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:41,320
好的  現在你們做對了
Okay, now you're getting it.

1660
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:49,140
好的  太棒了
Yes! Yes!

1661
01:27:53,230 --> 01:27:54,030
離這兒遠點
Get out of here.

1662
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:54,970
給他們點空間
Give 'em some space.

1663
01:28:03,450 --> 01:28:05,060
那邊有一點  這就是為什么...
Few right there, that's why...

1664
01:28:05,070 --> 01:28:06,780
你好啊  小可愛
Hi, you little cutie pie.

1665
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:09,590
我的水里有薄荷
Ew. My water has mint in it.

1666
01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:12,680
你開心嗎
You have a good time?

1667
01:28:15,330 --> 01:28:17,240
它們一旦開始互相舔臉
Once they started licking faces,

1668
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:18,560
就沒人能阻止了
no one could stop them.

1669
01:28:19,450 --> 01:28:21,410
伊森終于得到他需要的了
Ethan finally had what he needed.

1670
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:22,870
他很開心
He was happy.

1671
01:28:24,570 --> 01:28:25,820
我也很開心
I was happy, too.

1672
01:28:27,570 --> 01:28:28,640
不好意思  大家
Excuse me, everybody.

1673
01:28:29,150 --> 01:28:32,890
我想感謝你們今天能夠來到這里
I-I would like to thank you all for coming here today.

1674
01:28:33,870 --> 01:28:36,110
-這對漢娜和我很重要  -干杯
- It means a lot to Hannah and I. - Cheers.

1675
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:37,710
我一直想要有個大家庭
I've always wanted a big family.

1676
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:39,780
在一天之內  我就擁有了一個
All in one day, I've got one.

1677
01:28:39,790 --> 01:28:41,330
你沒說它有多大
You didn't tell me how big it was.

1678
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:45,260
我只想說說我有多感恩
I just would like to say how grateful I am

1679
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:47,630
我美麗的女孩
that my beautiful girl

1680
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,330
重新回到了我的生命中
walked back into my life.

1681
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:51,850
謝謝你
Thank you.

1682
01:28:52,850 --> 01:28:53,920
生命就是個謎
Life's a mystery.

1683
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:55,400
干杯
Cheers.

1684
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:01,920
我還想要做一件事
There was one thing I still wanted.

1685
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:04,020
我想要他知道那是我
I wanted him to know it was me.
