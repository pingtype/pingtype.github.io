哈勃博士  開始直播之前
Dr. Harber, before we're live,

20
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,850
我只想說  感謝你挑選了我
I just wanted to say thank you for choosing me.

21
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:33,720
吃葡萄不吐葡萄皮兒
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

22
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,700
你跟其他記者之間有不少嫌隙...
The rich history you have with other journalists...

23
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,900
我特地選了你  就因為我們過往沒有恩怨
I chose you precisely because we don't have a history.

24
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,640
所以別搞砸了
Now, don't fuck it up.

25
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,200
15秒倒計時開始
Fifteen seconds.

26
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,600
人們很信任你  幾十年來  一直很重視你
People trust you... for decades have valued you.

27
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,080
我覺得那是因為人們重視真相
I think that's because people value the truth.

28
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,340
好吧  但你不覺得你將這個「發現」...
Right, but don't you think your discovery was just...

29
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,880
分享給世人是一件很危險的事嗎
too dangerous to share with the world?

30
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,840
聽著  這是我投入了四十年心血研究出的成果
Look, this has been my life's work for over 40 years.

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,690
不是隨便得出的結論
There's nothing willy-nilly here.

32
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,610
經過一系列的探討與爭論
After much discussion, much debate,

33
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,110
我們都得出了同樣的結論
we all came to the same conclusion.

34
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,250
-結論是  -就是人們探索完全部的科學可能性之后
- Which is? - Which is, once you explore all scientific possibilities,

35
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,390
大家達成了共識
and you come to a consensus,

36
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,650
這項重大發現攸關人類生死存亡  
how can you keep a discovery so vital

37
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,440
怎可不公諸于世
to our existence a secret?

38
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,500
而這個「發現」就是...
And that discovery...

39
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,170
你證明了「來世」的存在
You proved the existence of an afterlife.

40
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,490
我更愿意稱之為「另一個次元世界」
I prefer to call it a new plane of existence.

41
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,150
我不會用「靈魂」  「天堂」  「來世」這種詞來解釋
I can't comment on terminology like "Soul" and "Heaven" and "Afterlife,"

42
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,340
但我可以說  科學證實了
but what I can say with scientific certainty is

43
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,280
身體死亡之后
that once the body dies,

44
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,050
我們的一部分潛意識就會脫離身體
some part of our consciousness leaves us

45
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,410
進入「另一個次元世界」
and travels to a new plane.

46
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,090
你發明的機器能夠捕捉到人死后
Your machine was able to capture brain wavelengths

47
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:53,280
離開人體的次原子層次腦電波
on a subatomic level, leaving the body after death.

48
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,940
-是這樣...  -沒錯
- Is that...? - That's correct.

49
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,120
那這些腦電波都去了哪里呢
Where do those wavelengths go?

50
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,270
我的重點是  確實存在「另一個次元世界」
My point is, a new plane of existence is out there.

51
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,780
這已無可爭議
Yes, that is no longer in dispute.

52
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,880
但你也無法告訴我們具體是什么
But you can't tell us what that is exactly.

53
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,400
你看到一輛火車離站時
When you see a train leave the station...

54
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,490
你需要通過了解車行駛的目的地
do you need to know where it's going to

55
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,630
而知道車要離開了嗎
understand that you saw it leave?

56
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,980
這種解釋讓人難以接受
It's a tough pill to swallow.

57
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,430
人們以前還不愿接受地球是圓的呢
At one point, so was the Earth being round.

58
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,960
但是  哈勃博士
But, Dr. Harber,

59
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,480
你為何等了六個月才向世人公布
why did it take you six months to address us?

60
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,060
你之前都去哪了
Where have you been?

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,150
好像是我邀請你到我家來的吧
It seems to me that I invited you here, to my home.

62
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,320
是  沒錯  謝謝你
Yes, you did. Thank you.

63
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,650
但自殺人數劇增到百萬人之后
But... we only received that invitation

64
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,160
你才邀請我們過來
after the suicide toll had rapidly reached a million.

65
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,760
而在此期間  很多名人  運動員
And during that time, celebrities, athletes,

66
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,870
甚至包括一個你關系親密的同事  
even a close colleague of yours,

67
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,930
都結束了自己的生命
all ended their lives.

68
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,650
所以我才同意跟你接受訪問  
Which is why I agreed to sit with you

69
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,780
試圖讓人們冷靜下來
and try to calm the waters.

70
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,920
好吧
Okay.

71
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,490
我想問你一個問題
I wanna ask you the question

72
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,750
估計電視機前的觀眾都很想知道
that everybody watching right now is probably wondering.

73
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,290
你覺得這么多人自殺是你的責任嗎
Do you feel responsible for all those people killing themselves?

74
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,850
不是
No.

75
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,620
-就這樣嗎  -就這樣
- That's it? - That's it.

76
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,760
謝謝你  哈勃博士  讓我可以去「來世」重生
Thank you, Dr. Harber... for my fresh start.

77
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,400
安迪  不要
Andy, no!

78
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,700
安迪
Andy!

79
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,630
-安迪  -不
- Andy! - No.

80
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,540
天吶
God!

81
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,710
-你為什么想不開啊  -快叫救護車
- Why would you do that? - Somebody call 911.

82
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,450
快來幫忙
Help! Some....

83
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,740
叫救護車
Call help, please.

84
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,850
趕緊去  叫人來
Right now. Get someone here.

85
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,920
天吶
My God!

86
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,230
你為什么要這么做
Why would you do that?

87
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,190
天吶
God.

88
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,830
關掉攝像機
Turn those cameras off.

89
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,000
{\an8}發現

90
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,100
歡迎繼續收看 「重大發現」兩周年紀念特輯
Welcome back to our coverage of the two-year anniversary of the Discovery.

91
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,400
我們要重溫過去兩年間的「試金石時刻」
We'll be revisiting the touchstone moments of the past two years,

92
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,110
我們將用一周時間來回顧
with retrospectives all weekend long.

93
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,380
托馬斯·哈勃公布「重大發現」之后
Hard to believe that it's been a year and a half

94
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,550
首次接受了獨家專訪時  有人在節目中自殺
since Thomas Harber's first and only post-Discovery interview

95
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,400
此事竟然已經過去一年半了
ended suddenly with an on-air suicide.

96
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,150
自此之后  全世界的自殺人數
Since then, the worldwide suicide toll

97
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,000
暴增到了令人驚愕的程度
has skyrocketed to staggering levels.

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,850
超過四百萬人已經選擇了自殺
Over four million people have taken their lives,

99
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,240
想去往「來世」
attempting to "Get there."

100
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,570
而托馬斯·哈勃博士  自從那次不堪回首的訪談之后
As for Dr. Thomas Harber, he has not made a public appearance

101
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,580
他就再也沒有公開露面
since that infamous post-Discovery interview.

102
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,150
完全隱居了
Completely off the grid--

103
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,290
我正聽著呢
I was listening to that.

104
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,040
我正聽著呢
I was listening to that.

105
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,350
抱歉  我以為船上就我一個人
I'm sorry, I thought-- I thought that I was alone.

106
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,090
現在是淡季
It's off-season.

107
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,550
你去這個荒涼的小島干什么
Why the fuck are you going to this dreary island?

108
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,420
你不也去嗎
Well, you're going there.

109
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,240
你是電影院里那種
Are you one of those lunatics who just sits

110
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,900
會跑到一個陌生人旁邊坐下來的神經病嗎
next to a complete stranger in an empty movie theater?

111
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,970
你看起來好眼熟
You look so familiar to me.

112
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,270
我們有可能見過
It's possible we've met,

113
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,800
但你的長相太普通  讓人記不住啊
but you don't have a memorable face.

114
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,730
好吧
Okay.

115
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,850
抱歉  我不知道我怎么說這種話
I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that.

116
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,550
我不是那個意思  我就是...
I didn't mean that. I just...

117
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,550
水的關系  我有點暈船
The water. I'm just a little seasick.

118
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,400
真是怪了  你很走運啊
That's weird. It's your lucky day.

119
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,290
我出門一般不帶著這玩意
I don't normally carry these around.

120
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,710
-頭暈藥  -我不暈
- Vertigo. - I'm not dizzy.

121
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,130
頭暈治不好  藥只是能緩解惡心的癥狀
You can't treat vertigo, just the effects. That's for nausea.

122
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,110
我看起來像是那種
Do I look like the kind of girl

123
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,970
隨便接受陌生人藥物的女孩嗎
who's just gonna take a pill from some strange guy?

124
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,390
說得倒也是
Fair enough.

125
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,510
艾拉  我叫艾拉
Isla. My name's Isla.

126
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,290
{\an8}愛爾蘭語  名字意為「島嶼」

127
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,290
盡管我看起來不像「艾拉」
I don't look like an Isla, though.

128
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,720
三歲之前
Your first three years,

129
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,310
人的長相和名字都很搭
you look like whatever name you're given,

130
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,640
到了4歲  你要么變得人如其名要么就...
then by four, you either settle into your name or you just...

131
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,260
-你呢  -什么
- What about you? - What?

132
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,460
你叫什么
What's your name?

133
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,810
威爾·史蒂文森
Will Stevenson.

134
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,100
威爾
Will.

135
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,480
怎么了
What?

136
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,820
我就是在想你的長相跟名字搭不搭
I'm just trying to see if you look like your name.

137
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,560
-你的結論是  -說不好
- What's the verdict there? - I don't know.

138
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,180
現在還言之過早
It's too early to tell.

139
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,570
「威爾」是個很隨意的名字
You know, Will is just such a, like, "Will" Name.

140
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,110
你真挺與眾不同啊
You're really something.

141
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,780
「重大發現」兩周年快樂  威爾
Happy second Discovery anniversary, Will.

142
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,040
{\an8}自殺不是良策

143
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,040
{\an8}堅守此生

144
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,040
{\an8}#別再自殺了  #發現生活

145
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,820
新聞上說據預測
They said on the news

146
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,570
今天又會有大批人自殺
they're expecting like a whole slew of suicides today.

147
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,050
大家想去「來世」慶祝周年紀念
People trying to get there for the anniversary.

148
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,910
這我也聽說了
I heard something about that.

149
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,740
你看過那個視頻嗎  就一群白癡拉拉隊員
Did you see that video of those dumb cheerleaders

150
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,070
在球場上吞藥的那個
taking pills on the 50-yard line?

151
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,530
我真無法理解這種自殺組織的概念
I just can't get behind the concept of suicide groups.

152
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,290
這太虛偽了  
It's so... disingenuous, you know?

153
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,540
我就是感覺太軟弱了
It just feels so weak.

154
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,660
你不相信「重大發現」嗎
You don't believe in the Discovery?

155
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,280
不  我不信的是自殺組織
No, I don't believe in suicide groups.

156
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,670
「重大發現」是  事實勝于雄辯
The Discovery is-- I mean, the proof is overwhelming.

157
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,410
「事實勝于雄辯」還不夠  要拿出確鑿證據
Proof shouldn't be overwhelming. Proof should be definitive.

158
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,870
所以你并不信
So, you don't believe.

159
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,270
我是不相信別人信的那一套
I don't believe the way everybody else does.

160
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,410
對  我不信
No, I don't.

161
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,350
-此話怎講  -我是個神經科醫生
- And how's that? - I'm a neurologist.

162
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,090
三個月前  我診治了一個病人  她很年輕
Three months ago, I had a patient, really young,

163
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,360
診斷下來她有腦癌  我很遺憾
found out that she had brain cancer. Very sad.

164
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,260
而她對此卻表現得
She reacted to that diagnosis

165
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,300
像是我遞給了她一張中了獎的彩票
as though I'd handed her a fucking winning lottery ticket.

166
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,050
并不是因為她希望
It wasn't because she hoped

167
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,750
或許她死后能上天堂
that maybe she was going someplace better.

168
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,730
而是因為「重大發現」
It was because the Discovery

169
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,850
讓她堅信一定會去更好的地方
made her think that it was guaranteed.

170
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,770
是啊  我們以前對待死亡只能聽天由命
Well, yeah. Death used to be something we just had to live with,

171
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,310
而如今死亡只是逃避痛苦的便捷手段
and now it's a convenient way to escape pain.

172
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,550
-這沒什么  -沒什么
- That's okay. - That's okay?

173
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,470
「另一個次元世界」  大概存在吧
Another plane of existence, maybe.

174
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,650
誰知道呢  
Who knows?

175
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,350
但我環顧四周
But I look around,

176
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,040
只看見一幫人跳下飛機
I see a lot of people jumping out of planes

177
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,050
希望自己會長出翅膀
hoping they're gonna grow wings.

178
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,020
現實和幻想是相斥的
Reality and fantasy are mutually exclusive.

179
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,360
他們是無法共存的
They don't exist in the same space.

180
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,400
你想說什么
What?

181
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,950
我5歲的時候  出過一次事故
When I was five, I had an accident,

182
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,960
「死」了一分鐘左右
and I died for about a minute.

183
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,520
我被救醒后 我跟父母說我看見了一些東西
When I was resuscitated, I told my parents that I saw something.

184
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,000
閃光  一個小男孩
Flashes. A little boy.

185
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,990
可能是我  或者我弟弟
Me, maybe, or my brother.

186
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,750
我感覺被困住了
I felt stranded...

187
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,020
困在哪兒了
Stranded where?

188
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,180
空蕩的海灘  這不重要  那只是個夢
This empty beach. It doesn't matter. It was a dream.

189
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,700
是個我醒來后  自己添油加醋過的夢
It was a dream that I embellished after I woke up.

190
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,070
你為什么要編這個故事出來
Why would you make all that up?

191
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,420
我覺得追尋意義是我們的本能
I think it's our instinct to search for meaning,

192
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,310
而一旦遍尋不著  我們就會本能地制造意義
and when there is none, it's our instinct to create meaning

193
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:56,740
我們會直接撒謊  自欺欺人
and we just... lie. We lie to ourselves.

194
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,230
你真煩人啊  有人這么對你說過嗎
You are so annoying. Has anyone ever told you that?

195
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,610
嗯  有的
Yeah, they have.

196
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,120
還好再等一分鐘我搭上車后
Thank God we only have a minute left together

197
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,950
我們就分道揚鑣了
before we're strangers again.

198
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,120
你覺得這個時節等一分鐘就能等到嗎  你瘋了啊
You think it's gonna be a minute this time of year? You're crazy.

199
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,270
是瘋  但我沒說錯
Crazy, but right.

200
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,510
你是個美女  我沒把這點計算在內
That's the attractive-girl component and I didn't factor that in.

201
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,300
你的數學有待提高啊
You'd better work on your math.

202
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,380
不管怎樣  我覺得你確實很像「艾拉」
For whatever it's worth, I think you do look like an Isla.

203
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,380
你見過多少個「艾拉」
How many of us have you met?

204
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,990
-我來吧  -不  我來  兄弟
- I got it. - No, I got it, man.

205
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,030
我可不想死在半路上  托比
Well, I don't want to die before we get there, Toby.

206
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,400
-這里發生什么了  -埃迪
- What's going on over here? - Eddie.

207
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,100
等下  埃迪·埃厄戴斯  埃迪死了
Wait, Eddie Iodice? Eddie died?

208
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,940
嗯  就為了去往「來世」
Yeah, just to get there.

209
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,290
去往該死的「來世」
Just to fucking get there.

210
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,620
他學瑪麗蓮·夢露
Guy pulled a Marilyn Monroe,

211
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,660
在臥室里吞了一整瓶藥
downed a whole bottle of pills right there in his bedroom.

212
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,140
那哥們人挺好的
Good dude, too.

213
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,270
-真的很遺憾  -你不想去參加葬禮嗎
- Real pity. - You didn't wanna go to the service?

214
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,710
去參加
Go to the...?

215
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:00,960
我寧愿把小雞雞插木材切片機里
I would rather stick my dick in a wood chipper

216
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,540
-也不想再參加一場該死的葬禮了  -懂了
- than go to another fucking funeral. - Got it.

217
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,420
我沒有你想象中那么傻
You know, I'm not as stupid as you might think.

218
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,110
那天你打電話來  我對你說
When you called the other day and I told you

219
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,120
爸又造了個新玩意兒...
that Dad had built something new...

220
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,760
那次通話后
after that conversation...

221
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,950
你突然就想回家了
suddenly you wanted to come home.

222
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,750
你這話說得像是跟他一樣多疑
You're sounding just as paranoid as him.

223
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,730
爸說他得換個地方
Dad said he needed to change things up.

224
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,390
暴露我們的地址太危險了
People knowing our address was too dangerous.

225
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,170
我很抱歉我不能在電話里告訴你
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you on the phone,

226
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:51,290
我們現在已經不信任電話了
but we don't trust phones now.

227
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,850
我們到了
Here we are.

228
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,960
去見「大魔法師」吧
Off to see the wizard.

229
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,860
這是什么鬼地方
What the fuck is this place?

230
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:37,770
這里本來是「問題少年」的夏令營營地
It used to be a summer camp for "Troubled youths."

231
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,010
我一直不明白
Which I never really understood,

232
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,220
如果他們都是壞孩子了
because if they're bad kids,

233
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,110
哪還有資格過有趣的暑假呢  你說呢
why would they deserve a fun summer? You know?

234
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,830
后來夏令營關了  被爸買下了
But then it shut down and Dad bought it.

235
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,860
你覺得如何
What do you think?

236
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,840
我覺得這簡直荒唐至極
I think it's completely insane.

237
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:56,870
事實上
Well, the truth is

238
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:01,750
我們需要更多收容空間
we just needed a lot more space to house things.

239
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,160
收容什么
House what things?

240
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,390
這些人都受到「重大發現」的影響
These people were all affected by the Discovery.

241
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,980
他們中有些人
Some of them arrived here

242
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,420
經過兩三次自殺未遂后來到這里
after two or three failed suicide attempts.

243
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,080
我們為其提供住所
We gave them a home,

244
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:20,470
提供活下去的動力  積極貢獻的理由
something to live for in this life, a reason to contribute.

245
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,790
有點小事
Real quick.

246
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:41,000
提醒下  類似聯邦局標準  禁止攜帶手機
Just FYI, FBI-type thing, protocol is no cell phones.

247
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,090
-好  行  我們走吧  -好
- Yeah, okay. Let's go. - Yeah.

248
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,420
別擔心
Hey, don't worry.

249
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,440
這真令人興奮
This is truly thrilling.

250
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,700
唯一能與其媲美的就是
I can only compare it to the model train set

251
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,960
我生日時  你讓我自己組裝的火車模型
you let me assemble by myself on my birthday.

252
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,550
時間有點太緊了
Cutting it a little close.

253
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,430
你了解我
Well, you know me.

254
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,860
坐如針氈  緊張不安
Pins and needles, needles and pins.

255
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,380
這些破爛機器
These goddamn machines.

256
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:25,610
-他是誰  -他的另一個兒子剛回來了
- Who the hell's that? - His other son just returned.

257
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,970
沒想到比我想象中要高一些
Surprisingly taller than I remember.

258
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,790
很高興我們又見面了  庫珀 
Good to see you again, Cooper.

259
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,400
威爾  這是萊西  萊西...
Will, Lacey. Lacey...

260
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,360
「挺順利的開場」
That went well.

261
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,590
老爸在哪
Where's Dad?

262
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,360
-他死了嗎  -沒  當然沒有
- Is he dead? - No, of course not.

263
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,690
他現在死了
He is now.

264
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,070
-15秒  -老爸
- Fifteen seconds. - Dad?

265
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,750
別激動  他們只是做些測試而已
Take it easy. They're just running some tests.

266
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,960
-都是些常規試驗  -10秒
- It's all routine. - Ten seconds.

267
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,960
除顫儀已充電...  準備就緒
Paddles charged... and ready.

268
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:13,410
他們通過電擊身體來重啟大腦
See, they're recharging the body to reboot the brain.

269
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,700
他最長一次試驗記錄  大概有60秒
The longest he's ever officially under is, like, 60 seconds.

270
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,420
這么說  老爸是先自殺  然后再被電活
So, Dad is now killing himself and electroshocking back to life.

271
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,840
不是
No.

272
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,910
差不多
Kind of.

273
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,620
但是你...  不是你想象中那樣
But you're... You're looking at this all wrong.

274
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,310
你總站在那個什么的對立面...
You're wearing whatever the opposite of...

275
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,950
什么來著  樂觀態度
What is it? Rose-colored glasses.

276
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,190
你就是那種態度
That's what you're wearing.

277
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,910
太悲觀
Shit-colored glasses.

278
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,670
總之  你不用擔心
Anyway, you shouldn't worry,

279
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:11,770
因為一切都受到嚴密監視  都在掌控之內
because all of this is being closely monitored and controlled.

280
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,380
而且我們都知道
And we both know

281
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,760
你對什么事都抱著懷疑的態度
you've always been slightly skeptical of everything.

282
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,390
老爸成立了個邪教
Dad started a cult.

283
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,140
-沒有  -你看不出來嗎  這就是個邪教
- No. - Can you not see that? This is a cult.

284
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,390
到處都是穿著不同顏色連體褲的信徒
All the way down to these followers in different-colored jumpsuits.

285
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:28,210
不  不  這里沒有階級  威爾
No, no, no. There's no hierarchy here, Will.

286
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:32,270
老爸管這叫做...  許可級別差異
Dad calls it... distinctions in clearance.

287
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:32,860
只是這樣  這不是邪教
That's all. It's not a cult.

288
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,170
應該換個「約束服」
It should be different. Straitjackets.

289
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,980
不管出于什么原因
You're the one that wanted to come back here

290
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,560
是你自己主動回來的  記得吧
if you remember for whatever reason. Right?

291
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,820
這個就是最有價值的問題了
Now, that, right there, is the million-dollar question.

292
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,830
歡迎回來  威爾
Welcome back, Will.

293
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,520
你有什么想對我說的嗎
You mind telling me something?

294
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,140
你回來有什么事
What are you doing back here?

295
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,440
我回來是想讓你叫停這一切
I'm here because I want you to stop it.

296
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:12,500
我想讓你結束這一切
I'm asking you just to put an end to all this.

297
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,620
我要怎么做
How would I do that?

298
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,940
承認你自己錯了
Say that you were wrong.

299
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:18,990
收回說過的話
Take it all back.

300
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,830
我不能收回  因為這是事實
I can't take it back, Will, because it's the truth.

301
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:22,850
沒人比你更清楚這點
Who knows better than you?

302
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,420
你可是這一切的靈感來源
You were the inspiration for this.

303
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,760
難道你不好奇嗎
Aren't you curious?

304
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,300
千萬別這么說  那不是...
Please, don't say that. That's not...

305
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,900
-我不是  -但就是你
- I wasn't. - But you were.

306
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,240
等一下
Hang on.

307
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:41,080
「因此  我相信
"Therefore, it is my belief

308
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,560
意識應該被視為是另一種物質狀態」
consciousness should be considered as another state of matter."

309
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,370
-別念了  -別急
- Please don't. - Hang on.

310
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:48,310
我還想念下這段  這段寫得更好
I'd like to get to this other part. It gets good.

311
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,650
「意識之屬性始于
"Properties of consciousness arise

312
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,170
支配我們宇宙的物理定律」
from the physical laws that govern our universe."

313
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,530
-我錯了  -你才不信自己錯了
- I was wrong. - You don't believe that.

314
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,390
我們錯了  老爸
We were wrong, Dad.

315
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,340
我們錯了  因為好多人都死了
We were wrong because a lot of people died.

316
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,350
還有更多的人在走上自殺之路...
And a whole lot more people are gonna kill themselves...

317
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,430
而你卻在這座荒謬的城堡里進行實驗
while you experiment here in this ridiculous fortress.

318
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:16,360
你要就讓我四十年的研究就付之東流嗎
So, just slamming on the brakes of 40 years' work?

319
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,580
那我將難辭其咎
I'd be saying I'm responsible.

320
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,020
或許你確實是
Maybe you are.

321
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,990
所以  你覺得我太過火了嗎
So, you think I've gone too far?

322
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,610
我不覺得我做得還不夠徹底
Well, I don't think I've gone far enough.

323
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,060
我們敞開門接收這些人  威爾
We opened the door for these people, Will.

324
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,300
他們知道「來世」存在
They know it's there.

325
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,380
我們得向他們展示其背后的真面目
Now we have to show them what's behind it.

326
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,130
艾拉
Isla!

327
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,070
艾拉
Isla!

328
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,730
艾拉
Isla!

329
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,660
艾拉
Isla!

330
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,840
該死
Fuck!

331
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,670
-你干什么啊  -你有毛病啊
- What are you doing? - What's your problem?

332
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,960
快  站起來  起來
Come on. Stand up. Get up.

333
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,870
你為什么要這么做
Why are you doing this?

334
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,770
不關你的事
None of your fucking business.

335
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,500
你坐在那艘該死的渡輪上
You sat there on that fucking ferry

336
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,330
和我交談了一番
and had a conversation with me,

337
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,070
其實已經鐵了心要這么做了
knowing you were gonna do this the whole time.

338
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:09,030
你本該是我生前最后交談的人
You were supposed to be the last person I ever spoke to.

339
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,830
你不能隨便就改變這一切
You don't get to just change that!

340
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,960
你連面對死亡都不帶感情
You're not even emotional about dying.

341
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,730
我對一切都沒有感情
I'm not emotional about anything.

342
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,520
我只是擔心...
I'm just concerned...

343
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,760
有人會曲解這件事
that this will all be perceived unfavorably by some.

344
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,030
她會得肺炎  托比
She was going to catch pneumonia, Toby.

345
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,490
我還是不懂  你想讓我怎么幫她
I still don't know what you want me to do with her.

346
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,120
你告訴我  你們接納需要幫助的人
You told me that you take in people who need help.

347
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,760
她需要幫助
She needs help.

348
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,990
她不能就這樣留下
She still can't just stay here.

349
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,050
我們有規定
We have rules.

350
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:02,330
那就不能為她破例一次嗎  求你了
Then can we make an exception... in her case, please?

351
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,370
這可關系到一條人命啊
We're talking about somebody's life.

352
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:08,280
我們都不知道她會不會再企圖...
We have no idea if she will attempt or try to...

353
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,040
再次自殺
Kill myself again?

354
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,790
你明說就好  
You can say it.

355
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,500
我清楚事情的始末
I know what happened.

356
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,360
我眼睜睜看著你毀掉了我的自殺計劃
I was there when you ruined it.

357
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,220
她和我相處得很愉快
She and I have been getting along great.

358
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,850
但我們還是有規定
We still have rules.

359
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,220
她得和老爸談談  
She has to talk to Dad,

360
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,570
也得完成問卷
and she has to take the questionnaire.

361
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,900
什么問卷
What's the questionnaire?

362
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,300
我們能...
Can we be...?

363
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,380
威爾  你有客人啊
Will, you have a visitor.

364
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,140
你父親是托馬斯·哈勃
Your dad is Thomas Harber?

365
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,670
除了問卷調查員  也就是我
So, nobody but the conductor, which is me,

366
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,540
沒人會知道你的回答
is gonna know your answers.

367
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,420
這里每件事都完全保密
Everything is completely discreet here.

368
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,480
萊西會出去  這里將只有你我二人
And now Lacey will be giving us some privacy.

369
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,850
以前  人們關注全球探索
It used to be about global exploration,

370
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,200
發現新大陸
you know, discovering new land,

371
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,790
后來又將目光轉向太空旅行了
and then it was space travel.

372
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,890
揭開宇宙黑暗一角的真面目
Shining a light on the dark corners of the universe.

373
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:05,080
如今的關注點在于探索「來世」
And now it's exploring what comes after this life.

374
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,860
探求「來世」的模樣
Seeing what's next.

375
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:08,900
你多大了
How old are you?

376
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,880
你們都是相同事物的一份子
You are all part of the same thing.

377
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,670
肌體的細胞
Cells in a body.

378
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,680
大海的波浪
Waves in the ocean.

379
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,530
靈魂無關年齡
The soul isn't young or old.

380
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,610
不是我們能夠提高的
It isn't ours to improve.

381
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:23,620
你認可這一事實嗎
Do you accept the fact that

382
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,040
時間是人為制造的非線性錯覺
time is a nonlinear illusion created by man?

383
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,890
下一題  我不懂這題什么意思
Pass. I don't know what that means.

384
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:32,620
這份問卷沒有標準答案
There are no right or wrong answers to this questionnaire.

385
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,500
那你為什么要問呢
Then why do you bother giving it?

386
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,260
問得好
That's a good response.

387
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,630
好  請說出你長處及弱點所在
Okay, greatest ability... and most disappointing weakness.

388
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,620
我擅長發現別人的行事意圖
I guess I'm good at seeing what makes somebody tick.

389
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,760
了解他們真實的自我
Understanding who they really are.

390
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,540
弱點呢
Weakness?

391
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,820
我能理解他們
I'm able to understand them,

392
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,620
但無法感同身受
but I'm not able to care about them.

393
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,100
如果有人對你提起了「潛意識」一詞
If somebody mentions "subconscious" to you,

394
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,190
你會想到什么
what do you think?

395
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,640
-記憶  -再往深處想一下
- Memory. - Dig deeper.

396
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,520
潛藏的記憶
Hidden memory.

397
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:03,040
你會壓抑情感嗎
Would you say that you suppress emotions?

398
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,810
我真的不太喜歡以這種方式談論自己
I don't really like talking about myself like this.

399
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:06,700
你不必喜歡這種方式
You don't have to like it.

400
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,890
我們每天都在審視自己
We think about ourselves every day.

401
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,880
我們對事物的認知來源于自身的觀點
Everything is from our own perspective.

402
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,870
所以  即使你不愿沉浸于
So, as much as you may not want to indulge yourself

403
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,340
審視內心深處的想法中
in looking at your most inner thoughts,

404
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:15,940
也無法否認其存在
they're there.

405
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,030
毫無疑問  思想真實存在
Make no mistake. They are there.

406
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,580
你相信靈魂的存在嗎
Do you believe in a soul?

407
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,700
如果不相信  就閉上眼睛
If not, close your eyes.

408
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,090
很好  假設靈魂真實存在
Great. Let's just say a soul does exist.

409
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,020
你覺得會位于身體的哪個部位呢
Where in the body do you think it'd be?

410
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,980
如果靈魂真實存在  應該會大腦中吧
I think if there's a soul, it would belong in the brain.

411
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,160
有點意思
Now, that's interesting.

412
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,960
多數人認為在腸胃中
Most people say the stomach.

413
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,500
但我很欣賞你的回答
But I like that you didn't.

414
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,260
你有過突然失去所愛之人的經歷嗎
Have you ever experienced sudden loss?

415
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,700
有
Yes.

416
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:04,800
那么  痛失所愛后恢復正常的過程中
And what aspect of regaining normalcy after losing someone...

417
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,110
最艱難的一點是什么
was the most difficult?

418
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,050
大概是冷冰冰的物體吧
Inanimate objects, maybe?

419
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:17,070
比如...  我的咖啡桌  
Like... my coffee table.

420
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,510
陪伴了我很多年
I've had it for years

421
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,960
而且  我大概注視過無數遍了
and I've probably looked at it a million times,

422
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,830
但自從他...
but after he--

423
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,660
熟悉的事物變得扭曲而陌生
Familiar objects just became distorted and unfamiliar.

424
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:32,280
我開始厭棄我的吊扇  麥片碗  茶壺
I started to hate my ceiling fan, my cereal bowl, my tea kettle.

425
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,420
好  最后一個問題
Okay, last question.

426
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,710
你真有自殺傾向嗎
Are you legitimately suicidal?

427
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:48,580
如果你知道「來世」的模樣
If you knew what came after... this life...

428
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,430
你覺得那會影響你做出的決定
do you think it would affect your decision-making

429
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,620
亦或甚至使你改變想法嗎
or maybe even make you change your mind?

430
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,560
可能會  已知會改變很多事情
Maybe. Knowing could change things.

431
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,210
你怎么知道自己會住這一間
How'd you know this is where you'd be staying?

432
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,860
我認出了我們以前的床
I found our old bed.

433
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,080
嗯  確實是
Yeah, I see that.

434
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,470
這么說來  你該感謝我
And you should thank me... by the way,

435
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:20,010
因為我費了好大勁才將這里保持原狀
because I fought long and hard to keep old faithful here.

436
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,450
艾拉怎么樣了
How's Isla?

437
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,440
我正是為這事而來  
That's actually why I'm here.

438
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,890
威爾  她死了
Will, she's dead.

439
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,020
不  她沒死  她沒死  
No, she's not. She's not dead.

440
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,630
就是說個冷笑話
That was a bad joke.

441
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,290
但問卷已經做完了
But the questionnaire is all wrapped up.

442
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,370
她可以留下
She can stay.

443
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,140
嗯  很好  她需要有人照顧
Yeah, good. She needs to be looked after.

444
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,410
她有可能再次自殺
She could try again.

445
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:49,290
我覺得那不太可能  威爾
I don't think that's going to happen, Will.

446
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,230
因為今晚...
Because tonight...

447
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,570
一切都將改變
everything changes.

448
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:07,520
我們終于揭開了「它」的面紗
We finally unveil it.

449
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,510
「它」是什么  托比
What is "It," Toby?

450
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,430
爸希望我邀請你參加今晚一個小集會
Dad wanted me to invite you to a little gathering tonight,

451
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,560
只有被選中的人才能參會
just a select group.

452
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,450
天  我們以前在家可完全不是這樣
Boy, this is nothing like our old house.

453
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,730
在我看來  你很贊同謀殺
It sounds to me a lot like you're advocating murder.

454
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,530
我不贊同謀殺
I'm not advocating murder.

455
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,710
我只是想說
I'm just pointing out that

456
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,120
多數人認為  終結他人的生命
most people don't look at ending somebody else's life

457
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,450
與終結自己的生命有所不同
the way they do their own.

458
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,730
他在哪里
Where is he?

459
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,280
就快要開始了
It's about to happen.

460
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,540
我搞不清你是不是在對我說話
I can't tell when you're talking to me or that.

461
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,730
真讓人惱火
It's really annoying.

462
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,420
總之  我想說的是
Anyways, what I'm saying is,

463
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,640
人們在通過自殺去往「來世」
people are killing themselves to get there.

464
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,230
到某個階段
At a certain point,

465
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,900
他們會用同樣的邏輯殺死別人
they'll use the same logic to kill somebody else,

466
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,620
因為他們只是把「死者」送往別的世界了  是吧
'cause they're just sending them somewhere else, right?

467
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,590
他終于來了
Finally, he's here.

468
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,980
他沒穿我留給他的臨時連體服
And he is not wearing the temp jumpsuit I had left for him.

469
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,100
大腦在處理經歷與體驗時
We're programmed to process our experiences

470
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,630
總是按照開始與結束處理
as having a beginning and an end,

471
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:24,770
而這在現實中是不存在的
when, in reality... doesn't exist.

472
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,360
存在的只有冗長乏味的中間過程
It's just one long, drawn-out middle.

473
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,020
你們中有些人比其他人來得晚
Some of you are newer than others,

474
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,680
但我想挑選些人成立一個小組
but I wanted to create a select group

475
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,280
來看看我的創造成果
that could see what it is that I built.

476
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:39,640
但這么做之前  我想花點時間
But before we do that, I'd like to take a moment

477
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,360
請你們和我一起
and have you join me in...

478
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,790
感恩祈禱
bowing our heads...

479
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:55,510
讓潛意識帶領你們去往他處
And let your subconscious... take you somewhere else.

480
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,240
我有些驚訝  你這么輕易就融入了這里
I'm sort of amazed that you get swept up in this, this easily.

481
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,640
你看起來不是那種動不動就祈禱的人
You don't strike me as a say-your-prayers type.

482
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,760
不信仰上帝
Just because somebody doesn't believe in God

483
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,440
并不意味著不能祈禱
doesn't mean they can't pray.

484
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,860
哪種無神論者會同上帝對話
What kind of an atheist talks to God?

485
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,370
你為什么跟我瞎說了你的姓
Why did you give me a phony, bullshit last name?

486
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:27,310
不是瞎說  是我母親的娘家姓
It wasn't phony. It was my mother's maiden name.

487
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,990
她人呢
Where is she?

488
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,920
她死了
She's dead.

489
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,250
怎么死的
How did she die?

490
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,330
是因為我父親
Because of my dad.

491
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,730
讓我們回到當下
Let us come back into this moment.

492
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,820
現在我要給大家一個機會
I now offer you the opportunity...

493
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,430
看看「來世」的樣子
to see the afterlife.

494
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,690
我能記錄到我們會去哪里了
I can now record where we go.

495
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:24,010
請盡快簽完字
Please... get these back to us

496
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,260
把文件還給我們
at your earliest convenience.

497
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:30,570
再次申明  這些住宿舍是暫時的
And again, these living quarters are just temporary

498
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:33,690
我們會為你找到更適宜的房間
until we can find you a more suitable room.

499
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,800
我剛搬來的時候  睡在廚房的小床上
When I first moved here, I slept on a cot in the kitchen.

500
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,650
「很豪華」
Glamorous.

501
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,040
我本該沉入海底的
I'm supposed to be at the bottom of the ocean,

502
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,600
所以這樣就很不錯了
so this should be fine.

503
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,460
能借我支筆嗎
Can I have a pen?

504
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,460
保密協議
Nondisclosure agreement.

505
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,420
考慮到敏感性
Well, considering the sensitivity,

506
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:55,970
這樣的標準性文件很必要
it's a fairly standard document.

507
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,380
你能出去一下嗎
Could we have the room for a second, please?

508
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,460
還記得那糟糕的一周嗎
You remember that awful week

509
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,110
我們睡在冰箱旁的折疊床上
when we slept on the cot by the fridge?

510
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,680
我的背痛得至今記憶猶新
My back sure hasn't forgotten.

511
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:15,310
我知道那個裝置非常引人入勝
So... I know that that device is very compelling.

512
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,170
我們能聊一下嗎
Can we talk about it for a second?

513
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,450
我不能聊這些
I'm not allowed to talk about it,

514
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:21,050
因為我剛簽了保密協議
'cause I just signed a nondisclosure agreement.

515
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,630
你父親是有些詭異  可又如何
So, your dad's a little weird. Who cares?

516
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,880
這不代表他說錯了
It doesn't make him wrong.

517
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:30,200
坡和他表妹上床了
I mean, Poe fucked his cousin.

518
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:32,140
{\an8}埃德加·愛倫·坡  美國詩人  浪漫主義思潮時期的重要成員

519
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,140
但這沒影響他在文學界的地位
It didn't make him any less a writer.

520
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,880
我想看看那個機器是不是真像他描述得那么厲害
I wanna see if that machine does what he thinks it does.

521
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,480
如果確實是呢
Well, what if it did?

522
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,080
那會有什么改變呢
How would that change things?

523
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:43,150
旅游度假前  總要先看宣傳冊吧
You don't go on vacation without looking at the brochure first.

524
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,560
抱歉  你睡了嗎
I'm sorry. Were you sleeping?

525
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,900
我站著呢
I'm standing.

526
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:58,250
也是
Well, yeah.

527
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,790
但總要這樣問一句吧
That's just something you're supposed to say, I guess.

528
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,340
既然你還沒睡
Since you're up,

529
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,290
能否下樓來  幫我看個東西呢
mind coming downstairs and taking a look at something for me?

530
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,330
當然
Yeah, sure.

531
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:16,110
我們失去的  其實并未失去...
Those that we have lost are not lost at all...

532
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,150
你們去哪里
Where are you guys going?

533
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,000
沒事  你別操心
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

534
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,550
其實是我們迷失了
...then it's us who are lost.

535
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,280
當他心跳停止時  
When he flatlines,

536
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,390
你可以想象成是關掉了一盞燈
think of it as a light bulb turned off by a switch.

537
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,460
把開關扳上  又扳下
Flip it on, flip it off.

538
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,150
但失去意識  連上新的儀器
But going under, hooked up to the new device,

539
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,490
可就不止是扳動電燈開關了
you're not just flipping a light switch.

540
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:40,230
基本上等同于拆開整個燈泡
You're essentially detaching the entire bulb.

541
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,120
因此我得說  如果你再次失去意識
So, I'd say that if you go under again...

542
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,400
蘇醒后  將會幾乎失去大腦功能
you're coming back with next to no brain functionality.

543
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:48,710
我很驚訝這居然還沒發生
I'm sort of surprised it hasn't happened already.

544
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,180
我知道你想第一個嘗試
I know you wanted to be first,

545
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,350
但如果你回不來  這又有什么意義呢
but if you don't come back, what's the point?

546
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:58,160
我們還是從頭再開始吧
We just go back to the drawing board. Right?

547
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:03,200
還是能行得通  只是得找個新的辦法...
I mean, it could still work, we just need to find a new way to...

548
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,530
我們需要一具尸體
We need a cadaver.

549
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,360
好吧  抱歉打斷你們
Okay. I'm sorry to interrupt.

550
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,040
你們打算去哪里找尸體
Where do you guys plan on getting a corpse?

551
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,980
我有個辦法
I have a corpse idea.

552
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,530
我很失禮嗎 
Am I being rude?

553
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,650
-我很失禮嗎  -不啊
- Am I being rude? -No.

554
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:43,200
-想聽聽音樂嗎  -好啊
- Care to... listen? - Sure.

555
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:48,700
寧靜的夜  歡快帶感的節奏
Crunchy groovy grooves. Serene nights.

556
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,170
能問你一件事嗎
Can I ask you something?

557
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:03,350
威爾之前談起你母親的事
Will mentioned what happened to your mom earlier.

558
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,200
她自殺的事嗎
That she killed herself?

559
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,920
沒這么說
Not exactly.

560
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,340
她是想去「來世」嗎
So, she was trying to get there?

561
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:15,470
不  那是發生在「重大發現」好多年之前的事了
No, that was a good couple years before the Discovery.

562
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,700
{\an8}自殺不是良策  堅守此生

563
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,480
進來吧
Yeah.

564
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,470
你好嗎
How you doing?

565
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:47,310
活著呢  身處亡者之中
In the midst of life, I am in death.

566
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,140
太詭異了
That was weird.

567
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,560
不知道你能不能幫我個忙
I was just wondering if you could help me out.

568
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,490
我的表哥  比利
My, cousin, Billy...

569
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,020
失蹤了
he's gone missing.

570
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:01,690
剛好是「重大發現」兩周年紀念日
And it being the two-year anniversary of the Discovery,

571
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:04,530
我們都有點擔心
we're all just a little worried.

572
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,760
很擔心
Really worried.

573
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,800
我們這周收到三具無名男尸
We got three John Does in this week.

574
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,220
他失蹤多久了
How long has he been missing?

575
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,930
不是  不是  比利不在這里
Nope. No. No Billy here.

576
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:16,900
真糟
Bummer.

577
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:19,260
如果是  我就能輕松不少了
Would have made my life a hell of a lot easier.

578
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,510
對不起  沒有考慮到你的感受
Sorry, that was insensitive.

579
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,180
只是尸體泛濫成災  我都快瘋了
They just got me running rampant here.

580
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,310
我一個人做著五個人的工作量
I'm doing the job of five people.

581
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,800
淡季裁員之類的  我明白
Off-season cutbacks and whatnot? Yeah.

582
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:35,150
我能給你描述一下比利長什么樣子嗎
Can I give you a description... of Billy?

583
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:38,420
這樣如果他真被送到這里
That way if he does... come in,

584
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,300
麻煩幫我留意一下
you can keep an eye out for him.

585
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:41,890
當然可以
Of course.

586
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,330
去我辦公室說吧
Let's go to my office.

587
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:57,990
{\an8}小心地滑

588
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,580
我只是有點好奇
Hey, so, just curious...

589
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:11,560
我想說的是  
I'd like to point out you're

590
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,610
你想在這么多尸體中找到符合條件的目標太難了
reading off a laundry list of corpse requirements.

591
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,070
這位得了腦動脈瘤  不行
Aneurysm, that won't work.

592
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,690
既然我們都已經入室盜竊了
It'd be nice if you could help me,

593
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,690
你就幫幫忙好不好
seeing as we're breaking and entering.

594
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:27,710
他長得就是一副氣鼓鼓的樣子
Like a real, like, pouty-type face.

595
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,500
還有就是...
And then...

596
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,970
他有塊胎記  長在...
he's got a birthmark on...

597
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:40,510
我想想  右邊胳膊肘的位置
Let's see. On his right elbow.

598
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,390
我說的特征  你一個都沒記下來
You're not writing any of this down.

599
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,410
我覺得你說得已經很詳細  不用再說了
Well, I think I've got more than I need to go on here, so...

600
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:50,020
但是我還沒有描述他下半身的特征呢
But we... We haven't even gotten to the lower half of his body.

601
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:51,610
你不覺得很不可思議嗎
Don't you think it's weird

602
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,680
幾個小時之前這些人還活著
how these people were alive a few hours ago?

603
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,490
他們有恐懼  有欲望  還會焦慮
They had fears and desires, they could exercise?

604
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:02,130
我不覺得不可思議  我覺得真可悲
I don't think it's weird. I think it's fucking sad.

605
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,880
或許他們去了一個更好的世界呢
Maybe they went someplace better.

606
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,350
或許他們去了一個更差的世界
Maybe they went someplace worse.

607
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,280
或許他們去的地方
Maybe they went someplace that

608
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,110
我們完全不能理解  毫無頭緒
we can't even begin to comprehend.

609
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,790
那就更應該看看你爸的機器能顯示什么
All the more reason to see what your dad's machine shows us.

610
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,050
該死
Shit.

611
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:18,840
怎么了
What?

612
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,850
「五十二歲  心肌梗死」
"Fifty-two, massive coronary."

613
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:27,590
威爾
Will...

614
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,380
來認識一下帕特·菲利普斯
meet Pat Phillips.

615
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:37,780
帕特·菲利普斯  這位是威爾
Pat Phillips, this is Will.

616
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,730
我不喜歡庫珀給我安排的嚇人房間
I don't like that creepy room Cooper put me in.

617
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,570
今晚我就睡你屋里了
I'm gonna sleep in your room tonight.

618
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:03,990
你睡上鋪還是下鋪
Top or bottom?

619
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,510
我們可以聊聊天
We could talk, you know.

620
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,620
我緊張的時候  要么話很多要么不說話
When I'm nervous, I talk too much or not at all.

621
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,260
這里講話很安全
Well, you're safe here.

622
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:29,300
上下鋪說過的話  都不會傳出去
I mean... nothing leaves the bunk beds.

623
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,420
我剛來時  他們給了我那件連體服
When I first got here and they gave me that jumpsuit,

624
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,730
上面繡著一個字母「V」
it had a V etched on it.

625
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:39,480
我想知道那是什么意思
I wonder what that stood for.

626
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,400
可能是「訪客」的意思
"Visitor," Maybe?

627
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,910
你是猜的嗎
Is that a guess?

628
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,150
猜得很有道理
That was a pretty good guess.

629
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,080
就像有的答案很明顯
It's like one of those really obvious answers

630
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,540
但是只有知道答案之后  才會恍悟
that only seems obvious after you find out about it.

631
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:55,510
你小時候是不是很聰明  你肯定是吧
Were you really smart growing up? I bet you were.

632
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,790
他們說我很早就顯示出
I was told that I demonstrated an early ability

633
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,390
識別空間格局的能力
to recognize spatial patterns,

634
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,850
不知道那是什么意思
whatever that means.

635
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,820
我一直覺得那就是老師對家長的一套說辭
I always took it as one of those things a teacher tells to

636
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,800
他們孩子表現差  這樣說讓他們好受些
a parent to make them feel better about their shitty kid.

637
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,870
比如說「戈登非常擅長畫圓圈
Like, "Gordon is very good at drawing circles.

638
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,130
戈登畫的圓圈
Gordon draws circles at a

639
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:14,630
比其他孩子畫得都高級」
more advanced level than the other children."

640
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,490
上下鋪真不錯
These bunk beds really worked out well,

641
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,730
一點都不尷尬  不用和你說
'cause they spared me the awkwardness of

642
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,850
我不想跟你上床
having to tell you I'm not gonna fuck you.

643
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,890
不好意思  我只聽到
Sorry, all I heard was

644
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,350
你說什么圓圈  還有不想和我上床
something about circles and not fucking me.

645
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,230
我不想自己一個人在上鋪煩心  威爾
I don't wanna be the only fucked up person on this bunk bed, Will.

646
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:35,790
要不然  你跟我說說你媽的事吧
Maybe... tell me about your mom now.

647
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,640
沒什么好說的  她自殺了
There's not much to tell. She killed herself.

648
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,480
在結婚紀念日當天自殺的
On their anniversary.

649
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,060
她是怎么自殺的
How did she do it?

650
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,390
她準備了二人晚餐
She made them dinner,

651
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:02,670
而我爸都沒出辦公室
and... my dad didn't even come out of his office.

652
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,470
如果當時他就是表示一下他還在乎她
If he'd even just hinted that he gave a shit,

653
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,990
誰知道結局會不會不同呢
I mean, who knows?

654
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:14,050
但是誰都不能打擾他  媽媽就上樓...
But he couldn't be bothered. So, she went upstairs...

655
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,710
去泡澡了
took a bath instead and,

656
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:22,000
第二天早上  我發現她死在浴缸里
Yeah, the next morning I found her in the tub.

657
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,670
所以你就離家出走了
And so, you left?

658
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,000
是的  沒辦法  我知道沒法留在家里
Yeah, I had to. I couldn't be around it. I knew.

659
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,680
就好像以前熟悉的一切
It's like everything that was recognizable

660
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,660
突然變得陌生起來
sort of instantly became unrecognizable.

661
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,450
有時候我覺得自己占了其他人的位置
Sometimes I feel like I'm taking someone else's spot

662
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:48,910
我感覺很悲哀
and then I feel sad.

663
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:51,790
這話什么意思
How do you mean?

664
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,980
就是  浪費生命的感覺
Like, being here alive is a waste

665
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,610
因為我不喜歡活著
because... I don't enjoy it,

666
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,110
我不幸福  也不去感恩
I'm not happy or grateful...

667
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:02,680
我覺得我活著占了其他人的位置
and I'm taking a spot away from someone who

668
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,910
如果是別人  可能會把人生過得更有意義
maybe would've gotten something more out of it.

669
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,560
好吧
Yeah.

670
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:09,390
生命的規則應該不是這樣吧
I guess I don't think it works that way.

671
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,160
我從來沒聽別人討論過一個問題
Here's something I haven't heard anyone talk about.

672
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,910
動物有「來世」嗎
Do animals have an afterlife?

673
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:23,650
兔子  貓咪  小豬  猴子之類的
Bunnies, kittens, pigs, monkeys.

674
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,520
它們死后會怎么樣
What happens to them after they die?

675
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:29,350
我真心覺得動物們值得擁有「來世」
I mean, I feel like they really deserve an afterlife.

676
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,700
動物有不同于人類的「來世」嗎
Do they have their own animal afterlife?

677
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:35,570
如果有  是按照物種劃分的嗎
And if they do, is it subdivided by species?

678
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,010
我覺得像「來世」這么意義深刻的事
Because it feels like something as profound as an afterlife

679
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:40,090
不應該區別對待
shouldn't practice segregation.

680
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,660
孩子們又會怎樣呢
And what happens to a child?

681
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,130
我們牽著手睡吧
Hold hands till we fall asleep?

682
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:20,450
這聽起來好像不太公平
This doesn't seem entirely fair.

683
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:25,030
好吧
Yeah, okay.

684
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,050
萊西
Lacey?

685
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:19,510
好  托比
Okay, Toby?

686
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,260
你按了嗎  再來一次
Did you hit? Hit it again.

687
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:36,960
再來
Again.

688
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,300
-再來  -我按了
- Hit it again. - I'm hitting it.

689
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,290
再按一次
Hit it again.

690
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,290
-你會把尸體電焦的  -托比  再來
- You're gonna fry the body. - Toby, hit it again.

691
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:50,700
再來
Again.

692
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:53,330
再電一次
Hit it again.

693
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,240
再來  再按一次
Again. Hit it again.

694
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:23,150
這是失敗了還是只是瓶頸
Is this just a setback or...?

695
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,810
我真的不知道
I'm really not sure.

696
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:23,000
你要見他嗎
Are you gonna see him?

697
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,240
還是想繼續視而不見
Or are you just gonna continue to ignore it?

698
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:30,500
抱歉...  我做不到
I'm sorry... I can't.

699
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,480
你當然做不到  你這輩子就這么窩囊
Of course you can't. Story of your fucking life.

700
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:37,450
只會逃避  把爛攤子丟給我
Just run away and leave me to deal with the mess.

701
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,690
你在對我的尸體做什么
What are you doing with my body?

702
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:52,800
你的尸體要在中午火化  我在做準備
Your body, is to be cremated at noon, so, I'm getting it ready.

703
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:55,560
我們還有點時間重來一遍
We do still have a little time to prep a redo.

704
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:59,270
重來  別逗了  你差點把尸體電焦
Redo? Guys, come on. You almost fried the body.

705
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:02,250
重來一遍是讓他早點火化嗎
You do this redo, you're gonna cremate him early. All right?

706
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,030
托比  找輛面包車  威爾說得對
Toby, rustle up a van. Will's right.

707
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:17,430
真好
It's good.

708
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:21,270
又能在實驗室見到你了  真好
Seeing you back in the labs again, it's good.

709
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:23,560
這才是你該待的地方
It's where you belong.

710
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:56,250
托比  馬上替我找具新的尸體
Toby, I want you to locate me a new corpse, immediately.

711
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:14,800
-我能問你個問題嗎  -問吧
- Hey. Can I ask you something? - Okay.

712
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:18,060
-你怎么到這兒來了  -怎么這么問
- How'd you end up here? - Why?

713
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:25,610
我回到家   發現我爸和我姐在客廳上吊了
I came home and found my dad and my sister hanging in my living room.

714
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:27,920
為了去往「來世」
To get there.

715
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:30,880
我很遺憾
I'm sorry.

716
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,970
沒事  他們不想帶上我
It's okay. They didn't want me to come.

717
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:45,090
你會感到被拋棄嗎
Can you imagine feeling abandoned

718
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:47,650
如果你爸沒讓你加入「全家自殺計劃」
'cause your dad left you out of the family suicide?

719
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,090
你怎么了
What's wrong with you?

720
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:55,270
沒  我在想事情
Nothing, I'm just... I'm processing.

721
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,950
你是不是活在自己的世界里出不來了
I mean, do you ever get out of your head even for one minute?

722
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:05,500
我們做個實驗  看著我
Let's do an experiment. Look at me.

723
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,870
看著我  說說你最先想到的念頭是什么
Look at me and tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.

724
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:08,670
我在開車
I'm driving.

725
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:11,950
好吧
Okay.

726
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,530
我不太了解你
I don't know you very well.

727
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,780
我覺得你很美  很活潑
I think you're beautiful, and alive,

728
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:20,760
你要是自殺
and if you killed yourself,

729
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,280
不僅是可惜  簡直是個悲劇
it wouldn't just be sad, it would be a tragedy.

730
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:26,890
少貧嘴了
Shut up.

731
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:37,770
-你抬頭還是腳  -頭
- You want the head or the feet? - Head.

732
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:39,280
好
Okay.

733
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:47,350
「艾拉  你最近忙什么」
"Hey, Isla. What are you up to?"

734
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:49,550
「沒什么  吉姆」
"Nothing much, Jim.

735
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:54,550
「只不過是把尸體拖過停車場」
I'm just... lugging a corpse through a parking lot."

736
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:56,510
為什么是「吉姆」
Why'd you go with "Jim"?

737
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:58,880
一個瞎編的人  你還吃醋
Don't be jealous of hypothetical Jim.

738
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,910
說真的  要是吉姆能讓你放棄自殺
Believe me, if hypothetical Jim makes you not wanna kill yourself,

739
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:04,470
我可以支持你們
I can be supportive.

740
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:05,710
就把尸體丟在這里嗎
Do we just leave it here?

741
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,790
你可能不信  這是我第一次還尸體
Believe it or not, it's my first time returning a corpse, so...

742
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:11,470
我只能即興發揮
I'm improvising.

743
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:18,880
你好  說來奇怪  我開車路過你們停車場
Hi, yeah, I was just driving by and this is kind of weird,

744
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,620
你們那似乎
but there seems to be, like,

745
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,610
躺著一具死尸
a dead body laying in your parking lot.

746
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:27,040
-厲害  -閉嘴  下車
- That was pretty good. - Shut up. Get out.

747
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,410
我在夸你做得不錯  -閉嘴
I'm saying you're doing a good job. - Stop it.

748
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:28,920
好吧  
Fine.

749
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,970
抱歉  是  島上信號不太好
Sorry. Yeah, no, bad... Bad reception on the island.

750
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:35,710
看上去尸體像被扔在這兒的  說不好
Yeah, the body seems to be abandoned, and... I don't know.

751
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:36,590
當然了  除非
Unless, of course,

752
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:39,050
你們在玩什么扯淡的「尋寶游戲」
you guys are playing some sort of fucked-up scavenger hunt.

753
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:44,790
好的  謝謝  再見
Okay. Yes, thank you. Bye.

754
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:56,080
-怎么樣  -很順利
- How'd that go? - It went really well.

755
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,160
你竟然對這種事出奇得在行
Okay. You're, like, weirdly good at that.

756
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:02,360
他們過來了
Here they are.

757
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,890
他們也挺困惑
They're pretty confused.

758
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:07,790
你覺得他們在想什么
What do you think they're thinking?

759
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:11,810
不知道  但我覺得帕特·菲利普斯
I don't know, but I think Pat Phillips

760
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:13,720
過去幾天吃了不少苦頭
has had a really tough few days.

761
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:16,330
我們都會下地獄的
We're both going to hell.

762
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:19,750
是啊  誰知道「來世」什么樣
Yeah. Whatever the afterlife is, I guess.

763
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,460
太蠢了
Just stupid.

764
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:12,840
你要見他嗎
Are you gonna see him?

765
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:17,060
還是想繼續視而不見
Or are you just gonna continue to ignore it?

766
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:20,460
抱歉...  我做不到
I'm sorry... I can't.

767
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:24,360
你當然做不到  你這輩子就這么窩囊
Of course you can't. Story of your fucking life.

768
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:27,330
只會逃避  把爛攤子丟給我
Just run away and leave me to deal with the mess.

769
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:45,260
{\an8}附近的醫院

770
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:19,530
如果這一世只是一場夢呢
What if this life is just a dream?

771
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:20,450
卡車借我一用
Can I borrow your truck?

772
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:23,090
我得...  去取點東西
Just for... I have to go get some stuff.

773
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:16,400
{\an8}自殺不是良策  堅守此生

774
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,250
據我們的記錄顯示
As far as our records indicate,

775
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:19,430
醫院接受過的病人里  叫菲利普斯的有23個
we've had 23 patients with the name Phillips on file.

776
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:25,330
-你們的記錄有多準確  -很準確
- How accurate are your records? - Accurate.

777
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,410
我想看看名單
I would love to see that list.

778
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,940
我想也是
I'm sure you would.

779
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,880
{\an8}自殺不是良策  堅守此生

780
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,560
搞什么
What the fuck?

781
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:32,310
你在找什么嗎
Are you looking for something?

782
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,700
也許你能幫我
Maybe you can help me.

783
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,480
-這里以前是個走廊嗎  -以前是
- Did there used to be a hallway here? - Used to.

784
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:42,830
院方改建了一下
They did a little remodeling.

785
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,980
還花了不少時間
Took their sweet-ass time with it, too.

786
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:50,560
抱歉  改建是多久之前的事
I'm sorry, how long ago was that remodel?

787
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,240
大約十年前吧
About a decade ago.

788
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,810
你去哪兒了
Where have you been?

789
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:37,080
發現了一件有意思的事
This is... This is interesting.

790
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:46,990
好了  謝謝你  托比
Okay, thank you, Toby.

791
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:48,780
謝謝你  孩子
Thank you, my boy.

792
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:53,160
大家好
Well, hello to you all.

793
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:56,100
一如既往  很榮幸發表講話
As always, it's a pleasure.

794
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,110
你們剛到這里時  你們...
When you all first got here, you...

795
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:03,530
你們都用過這臺設備
You used this, uh, piece of equipment.

796
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:05,800
填過調查問卷
The questionnaire.

797
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,890
你們的回答令你們得以留在此處
And your answers are what allowed you to stay here,

798
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:12,520
基本上  信任自此建起
so, basically... a trust was built.

799
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:15,690
但最近我在想
But lately, I'm beginning to wonder

800
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:18,590
我們這里是不是太安逸了
if perhaps we're getting just a little too comfortable here.

801
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,260
無稽之談甚囂塵上
There's a lot of loose talk going on.

802
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:23,230
不禁讓我反思
And it makes me think

803
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:26,060
也許是對你們太放松了
that we just might be losing a little focus.

804
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,200
萊西  能上來一下嗎
Lacey, would you join me, please?

805
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:42,050
-怎么了  -沒事  放輕松
- What's going on? - It's okay. Relax.

806
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:45,100
告訴大家  你來這里多久了
Would you like to tell us how long you've been here?

807
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,620
一年多
just over a year.

808
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:52,350
一年多  你是頭一批來的
Just over a year. You were one of the first.

809
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:54,100
你在此待遇如何
How have you been treated?

810
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,030
過得好嗎
Have you been treated well?

811
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:58,110
-我對你好嗎  -你對我很好
- Have I been good to you? - You've been wonderful.

812
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:01,760
-為什么這樣說  -對你很好
- Why are you talking to me like this? - I've been wonderful.

813
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:03,620
既然我對你很好
If I've been wonderful,

814
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:06,600
為什么你要把機器的事告訴同伴了
then why are you telling your peers about the device,

815
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:10,340
特別是...  為什么你說機器失敗了
and particularly... why are you saying it failed?

816
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,230
說話
Speak up.

817
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:21,540
沒關系
It's okay.

818
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:24,420
我只告訴了一個人
I just told one person.

819
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,550
新來的女孩受邀了  我跟人提起時
It slipped out when I had mentioned

820
00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:29,310
不小心說漏了嘴
how the new girl was invited.

821
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:31,650
你是說艾拉
You mean Isla.

822
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,330
我邀請她  你不開心了是嗎
You were displeased when I invited her here, weren't you?

823
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:40,030
只是覺得有些在這待得更久  卻沒受到邀請
It's just that some people who have been here much longer weren't asked.

824
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:42,280
告訴大家我在哪里找到的你
Tell everyone where I found you.

825
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:45,420
托馬斯
Thomas.

826
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:46,970
沒關系的
It's okay.

827
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,440
你可以講
This is a safe place.

828
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:57,610
在樹林里
In the woods.

829
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:01,980
繼續
Go on.

830
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:09,130
我拿著槍
I had a gun.

831
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,190
你的槍對準了哪里
And where was that gun aimed?

832
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:17,750
我的胸膛
At my chest.

833
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:20,640
就在你心臟邊上
Right next to your heart.

834
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:23,760
通常想自殺的人會對準頭部
Usually, it's the head...

835
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:25,720
或是把槍管放進嘴里
or the barrel goes into the mouth.

836
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,780
我之前可沒見過像你這樣自殺的人
I don't know that I've ever seen it done that way before.

837
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:32,000
對不起
I'm sorry.

838
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,160
求你不要對我失去信任
Please don't lose faith in me.

839
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,220
「信任」
"Faith."

840
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:43,400
天啊  我真是瞧不起這個詞
Oh, God. I have such contempt for that word.

841
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,740
但凡有人依靠信任
Show me someone who relies on faith

842
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,650
就會有人過度信任
and I'll show you someone who's given up control

843
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:49,440
最后結局一發不可收拾
over whatever it is they believe.

844
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,300
抱歉  我沒什么能幫到你了  萊西
Sorry, there's nothing more I can do for you, Lacey

845
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,580
托馬斯  求你了
Thomas, please.

846
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:53,840
收拾好行李
Pack up your belongings.

847
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:55,080
跟大家說再見吧
Say your goodbyes.

848
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:21,220
剛才真是一出好戲啊
That was a hell of a show out there.

849
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:24,550
得了吧  威爾
Come on, Will.

850
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:28,040
你以為我不知道這里很多都是胡扯嗎
You think I don't know a lot of this is bullshit?

851
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:31,470
你給生無可戀的人提供了活下去的意義
You give meaning to people who think they have no more reason to live.

852
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:34,850
連身衣  管理系統  夸張的表演
The jumpsuit, the chain of command, the theatrics.

853
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:38,610
他們靠這些活下去  我關心他們
It gives them purpose. And I care about them.

854
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:41,280
是啊  這些話該說給萊西聽
Yeah. Someone should tell that to Lacey.

855
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:49,000
你可以繼續假裝你離開的原因是
You... You can pretend all you want that the reason you left was

856
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,140
你不再贊同我的成果
because you stopped approving of my work.

857
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:53,250
但別忘了  這是我倆一起的成果
Work, by the way, that we did together.

858
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:54,810
但我們都知道
But I think we both know

859
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:57,480
對你來說  一直都不是因為「重大發現」
this was never about the Discovery for you.

860
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,770
而是因為你的母親
It was always about your mother.

861
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:00,880
是  當然是因為我媽
Yes, of course it was about Mom for me.

862
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:11,190
你想假裝媽媽的事沒發生
Just because you wanna pretend like Mom did not happen...

863
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,650
不代表我也得這樣
doesn't mean that I'm going to.

864
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:32,480
-我能給你看些東西嗎  -什么
- Can I show you something? - What?

865
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,090
-跟我來就好  來吧  -抱歉
- Just come with me. Please. - Sorry.

866
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:40,990
等等
Wait.

867
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:44,040
-這是什么  -我也想弄明白
- What is this? - That's what I'm trying to figure out.

868
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:47,490
你之前打算一直瞞著我嗎
You were gonna keep this from me?

869
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:50,000
沒  我這不是給你看了
No, I'm... I'm showing you now.

870
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,830
我怕你可能還想自殺
And I was afraid of what you might do.

871
01:02:57,930 --> 01:02:59,230
好吧  所以  「來世」...
All right, so, the afterlife...

872
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:00,000
這就是「來世」嗎
This is the afterlife?

873
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,200
這怎么可能是「來世」呢
How can it be the afterlife

874
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,110
我們就在上面顯示的這個停車場里
if we're sitting in the same parking lot in that recording?

875
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:05,660
那這是什么
Then what is it?

876
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:06,380
我的推論是
My theory is that

877
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:09,320
我父親發明出了某種記錄記憶的機器
my father invented something that records memory.

878
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:12,710
你聽他不停地念叨過潛意識
You've heard him go on and on about the subconscious.

879
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:16,950
我知道你希望是其它結果
I understand that you wanted this to be something different.

880
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:21,170
但事實勝于雄辯  這是帕特·菲利普斯的記憶
The proof is overwhelming that that's a Pat Phillips memory.

881
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,180
「事實勝于雄辯」還不夠  要拿出確鑿證據
Proof shouldn't be overwhelming. It should be definitive.

882
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:39,470
我們到底要去哪里啊
Where the fuck are we going?

883
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,810
如果視頻中的事真實發生過
If what we're seeing on that video happened in real life,

884
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:44,530
我要查出何時發生的
I'm gonna find out exactly when.

885
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:46,160
這家醫院自開辦以來
Since this hospital opened,

886
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,560
一共收過23個叫菲利普斯的患者
there have been 23 patients named Phillips.

887
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:50,730
但根據他的貨車型號
But based on the model of his truck,

888
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:54,420
我可以排除2000年之前入院的菲利普斯
I can eliminate any Phillips from before the year 2000.

889
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:57,650
但就算是2000年之后  也還是有好多人吧
Yeah, but even after 2000, doesn't that leave a lot of names?

890
01:03:57,650 --> 01:03:59,320
那間病房不存在了
That hospital room doesn't exist anymore,

891
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,900
所以我們可以交叉比對過去十年
so, we can also cross off any Phillips

892
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,480
入過院的菲利普斯
from the past decade.

893
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:10,180
那就只有這一個了
That leaves us with one.

894
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:19,210
「康納·菲利普斯」
"Connor Phillips"?

895
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:21,140
就是他
That's him.

896
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:23,870
這是帕特·菲利普斯的父親
That's Pat Phillips' dad.

897
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,570
他十三年前死在這里
He died here 13 years ago.

898
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,430
這么說  機器只是錄下記憶嗎
So, it does just record a memory?

899
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:40,300
今天的事真是太操蛋了  對吧
It's pretty fucked up what happened today, huh?

900
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:41,270
萊西的事
With Lacey?

901
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:43,300
她說錯話了
She spoke out of turn.

902
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:45,830
她知道規矩
And she knew the rules.

903
01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:48,030
她有份參與訂下這些規矩
She basically helped write them.

904
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,730
這里就咱倆說話呢
It's just you and me talking.

905
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,000
你不是真信這些吧
You don't believe that.

906
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:54,480
別跟我說我該信什么  威爾
Stop telling me what I believe, Will.

907
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:02,490
證明「來世」的存在  毀了爸的一生
Proving the existence of an afterlife destroyed Dad's own life.

908
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:04,130
這才是我相信的
That's what I believe.

909
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:07,810
還毀了別人的人生
Yeah... everybody else's, too.

910
01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:09,490
爸沒打算
Dad has no intention...

911
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:12,920
將機器記錄的一切公之于眾
of showing anything the machine records with the outside world.

912
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:17,780
所以萊西告訴別人時  他才失控了
That's why he lost it when Lacey told people.

913
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:21,050
如果他沒打算將這臺機器的作用公之于眾
If he has no intention of showing what it does to anybody,

914
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:23,930
那還研究什么  還有什么意義
why is he doing it, huh? What's the point?

915
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:25,940
「他還研究什么」
"Why is he doing it?"

916
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:30,360
「他還研究什么」
"Why is he doing it?"

917
01:05:31,310 --> 01:05:32,320
想想看吧
Let's see.

918
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:41,020
他會跟你說說  死去的上百萬人
he'll tell you about the millions of people who died,

919
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,810
他會告訴你  完成這項研究是為了紀念那些人
and he'll tell you about finishing his work to honor them.

920
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:46,560
我昨天聽過了
I heard that yesterday.

921
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:49,460
而我都聽了兩年了
I've been hearing that for the past two years now.

922
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:57,630
我就微笑  點頭  贊同...
And I just... smile and nod and agree...

923
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:02,470
像個低智商的兒子  但我心里跟明鏡一樣
like the idiot son, but I do understand things.

924
01:06:05,770 --> 01:06:07,670
我知道媽死了...
I know Mom died...

925
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,680
不是死了  是自殺
Not died. She killed herself.

926
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:14,690
她自殺了
She killed herself.

927
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:18,850
你看看...
And when you look...

928
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:23,070
爸畢生的研究
at what Dad spent his life working on,

929
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:27,870
再看看媽自殺的方式
and when you look at the way Mom killed herself,

930
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:29,240
她是如何自殺的
how she did it...

931
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:35,750
爸內疚的同時
how would Dad not feel a little anger

932
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:37,910
怎么可能會不憤怒呢
on top of his guilt?

933
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:46,590
爸必須得弄明白
Dad does need... to know.

934
01:06:48,110 --> 01:06:50,430
他需要知道她去到「來世」了
He needs to know that she made it somewhere.

935
01:06:54,990 --> 01:06:56,770
他反應過激了而已
He overreacted, that's all.

936
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:03,160
他會醒悟過來  萊西明天就會回來
He'll come to his senses, and, Lacey will be back by tomorrow.

937
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:10,580
爸總是能醒悟過來
Dad always comes to his senses.

938
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:22,940
那不是記憶  威爾
It's not a memory, Will.

939
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,100
什么
What?

940
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:28,990
他左手臂上的同一位置  紋身圖案不同
On his left arm in that exact spot, there was a different tattoo.

941
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:31,910
-這怎么可能  -不知道  但我在實驗室見過
- How is that possible? - I don't know, but in the lab, I saw it.

942
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:34,220
不是燈塔  他手臂上的圖案是波浪
It wasn't a lighthouse. It was waves on his arm.

943
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:36,410
-你確定嗎  -我確定
- Are you sure? - Yes. I'm sure.

944
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:38,730
威爾  這不是記憶  而是其它解釋
Will. It's not a memory. This is something else.

945
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:41,720
如果不是記憶  那是什么呢
If it's not a memory, then what is it?

946
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:46,750
我們見到的一切都不存在了
Everything we've seen doesn't exist anymore.

947
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:50,760
那間病房不在了  帕特·菲利普斯顯然也不在了
I mean, the hospital room's gone, Pat Phillips, obviously gone.

948
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:55,320
我們得找出視頻中還存在于現實的事物
We need to find something in this video that still exists.

949
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,770
那個女人  有一個...
The... the woman. There's a...

950
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:04,650
她
Her.

951
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:09,190
康納·菲利普斯的死亡證明書上有家里地址
We have Connor Phillips' address on his death certificate.

952
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:12,460
不如我們明天過去瞧瞧
So, I say that we go down there tomorrow...

953
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:15,550
看看有沒有人能幫我們找到她
and we see if somebody can help us track her down.

954
01:08:30,430 --> 01:08:32,020
威爾  我們怎么回到這里了
Will, why are we back here?

955
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:35,400
我不知道我們去那間房子會查到什么...
I don't know what's waiting for us at that house, and I...

956
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:42,360
你記得我和你說過  我小時候發生的意外嗎
Do you remember I told you about my accident when I was a kid?

957
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:45,380
記得  你騙你媽說看到一些東西
Yeah, when you lied to your mom about what you saw.

958
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:46,670
我沒騙她
I didn't lie.

959
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,290
我沒騙她
I didn't lie.

960
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:54,660
我就是在這里看到的...
This is where I saw whatever...

961
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:58,180
不管我看到的景象是什么  就在這個海灘上
Whatever it is that I saw. This is the beach.

962
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,620
我小時候經常來這里  就像...
I used to come here when I was a kid, like...

963
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:06,210
這里有種魔力吸引我
I was drawn to it.

964
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:09,630
或者說這里讓我感覺好受點
Or it made me feel better.

965
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:12,630
總之
Anyway...

966
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:19,210
所以那天我看見你走進水里...
when I saw you walking into the water the other day, that's...

967
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:20,740
所以我才出現了
That's why I was here.

968
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:26,910
怎么了
What?

969
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:07,330
我之前有個兒子
I had a son...

970
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:13,740
他當時五歲
and he was five years old.

971
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:19,000
我睡著了
And I fell asleep...

972
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,390
就一小會兒
just for a second.

973
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:28,120
我醒來時  他不見了
And when I woke up, he was gone.

974
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:06,950
我一開始感覺  我不該與你相識...
At first I thought I wasn't supposed to meet you...

975
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:09,270
不該有什么感覺
or feel anything.

976
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:15,030
但也許我想錯了
But maybe I was wrong.

977
01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:52,040
你好  這里是菲利普斯的家嗎
Hi. Is this the Phillips residence?

978
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:54,760
康納  你認識康納·菲利普斯嗎
Connor... Did you know Connor Phillips?

979
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:58,160
帕特·菲利普斯呢  你會說英語嗎
Pat Phillips? Can you speak English?

980
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:02,020
好吧
Okay.

981
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:04,710
顯然她不是視頻中的那個女人
Okay, well, that's clearly not the woman from the video.

982
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:08,270
也許他們搬走了吧
Maybe they moved or something.

983
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:10,220
要不看看他們有沒有遷新地址
Should we see if they have the new address?

984
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:12,690
不知道  不知道
I don't know. I don't know.

985
01:12:15,730 --> 01:12:16,860
有什么事嗎
Can I help you?

986
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:23,510
我已經很多年沒見過我哥了
I haven't seen my brother in years.

987
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,430
比起我  更失落的是她吧
I'd call it more of a loss for her than for me.

988
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:29,390
阿茲海默癥「老年癡呆」Alzheimer's.

989
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,990
父親死后  她的病情就開始惡化
She deteriorated after Dad died.

990
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:34,180
-康納嗎  -你認識我父親嗎
- Connor? - You knew my father, too?

991
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:36,590
其實是聽帕特提過
You know, actually, Pat mentioned him.

992
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:39,020
他說他在父親死前  去看望過他
That he went to see him before he died.

993
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:41,690
總之  父親死后
Well, anyway, Dad died and...

994
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:45,810
母親的身體狀況就急轉直下
Mom, she started going downhill real fast after that.

995
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,950
這幢房子現歸我和我丈夫所有
My husband and I, we own the house now.

996
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:52,460
你們會給帕特安排什么追悼會嗎
Is there gonna be a service or anything, um, for Pat?

997
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,130
我不知道
I wouldn't know.

998
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,300
抱歉  恕我直言
I'm sorry, if you don't mind me saying,

999
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:00,290
但感覺你對你哥的死并不難過
you just ,you don't seem that upset about your brother's death.

1000
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:02,510
是這樣
Look...

1001
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:04,860
看來你們好像挺喜歡這個人
it seems as though you liked him.

1002
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:06,460
你們看到了他的某些特質
You found something in him...

1003
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,380
但是我很抱歉
so, I'm sorry.

1004
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:13,640
對于我們來說  他就是個人渣
But to the rest of us... he was a piece of shit

1005
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:16,330
留他妹妹一人照顧罹患癌癥的父親
who left his sister with a cancer-ridden father

1006
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:19,530
還有神志不清的母親
and a mother who lost every marble she ever had.

1007
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:25,340
抱歉  那么你最后一次見帕特
I'm sorry. So... is the last time that you saw Pat

1008
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:27,690
就是他去醫院看你們父親
when he went to visit your Dad in the hospital?

1009
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:30,730
我不知道他跟你們都瞎說了些什么
I don't know what bullshit he hauled your way,

1010
01:13:30,730 --> 01:13:33,290
但他從沒去醫院看過父親
but he never visited my father in the hospital.

1011
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,050
如果他說去了  那就是說謊
If he told you that, it's a lie.

1012
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:40,920
他打過電話說要來看他  但從未露面
He called and said he was gonna visit him, but he never showed up.

1013
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:45,170
這么問也許有點怪  帕特有紋身嗎
This is gonna sound really strange, but did Pat have a tattoo?

1014
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:46,830
他告訴你的嗎
He told you about that?

1015
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:56,730
他十八歲的時候  我們一起紋了一對波浪
When he turned 18, we got matching waves.

1016
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,330
我們當時關系很好
We were really close then.

1017
01:14:10,150 --> 01:14:11,840
看來機器記錄那段的不是記憶
So, the machine doesn't record a memory.

1018
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,370
你爸的結論沒錯
It wasn't a bad theory.

1019
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:17,940
人們會一直繼續自殺
People are just gonna keep killing themselves.

1020
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:21,390
你遲早都得原諒你父親  威爾
You know, sooner or later, you're gonna have to forgive your dad, Will.

1021
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:26,360
我一直在思考  事物的本身和其意義
I've been thinking a lot about the difference between...

1022
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:29,790
究竟有什么不同
what something is and what something means.

1023
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:32,960
我不知道這段記錄到底是什么
And I don't know what any of this is...

1024
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:37,350
但我知道  如果這背后真有某種意義
but I do think if there's a meaning to any of it,

1025
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:40,690
應該是無論生活如何艱辛
it has something to do with not pressing the reset button,

1026
01:14:40,690 --> 01:14:42,760
都不該選擇自殺重活
even if things get really rough.

1027
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:57,920
人們兜兜轉轉
We're a bunch of people running around,

1028
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,730
一次又一次重復過去的錯誤
making the same mistakes over and over.

1029
01:15:01,890 --> 01:15:05,040
為什么會覺得換了個地方  就會有所不同
And I don't know why we think it'll be different somewhere else...

1030
01:15:06,650 --> 01:15:09,160
除非這一世  我們已經學到應有的教訓
unless we learn what we're supposed to learn while we're here.

1031
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,780
你兒子叫什么名字
What was your son's name?

1032
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:34,900
奧利弗
Oliver.

1033
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:41,140
我在做夢
I was dreaming.

1034
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:45,340
他掉進海里的時候  我在做夢
When he was in the water, I was dreaming.

1035
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:48,320
什么夢
What about?

1036
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:51,670
說不清
I don't know.

1037
01:15:53,310 --> 01:15:54,350
我不記得了
I can't remember.

1038
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:59,510
就是你知道自己在做夢
It was one of those times where you know for sure you're dreaming,

1039
01:15:59,510 --> 01:16:00,680
但是不知道...
but you just don't...

1040
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:03,530
夢境的內容
don't know what about.

1041
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:08,490
我要是知道就好了
I wish I knew.

1042
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:20,740
如果很難受  你可以不用一個人承擔
You don't have to do this alone anymore if you don't want to.

1043
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:04,420
威爾
Will!

1044
01:17:06,570 --> 01:17:08,030
媽的  威爾
Fuck! Fuck, Will!

1045
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:11,850
快起來  爸出事了  你干什么呢
Get up. It's Dad. What the fuck are you doing?

1046
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:12,830
爸怎么了
What about Dad?

1047
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:16,160
-爸出事了  趕緊起來  -好  我來了
- It's dad. Get the fuck up. - Okay. All right. I'm coming.

1048
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:20,580
我不懂  所以我沒辦法阻止
I didn't know, so, I couldn't stop it.

1049
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:22,970
冷靜點  告訴我到底怎么了
Slow down and tell me exactly what happened.

1050
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:24,500
他把自己連上了機器
He hooked himself up to the device.

1051
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,810
他想證明機器沒問題
He wanted to prove that it works.

1052
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:28,320
-爸連上機器了嗎  -對
- Dad's hooked up right now? - Yes.

1053
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,550
我們得告訴他  機器有用
We need to tell him that it works.

1054
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:31,710
什么
What?

1055
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:33,700
什么有用
What works?

1056
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:36,380
-你們搞什么  -他要求的
- What are you doing? - He demanded.

1057
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:39,630
-為什么不弄醒他  -太遲了
- Why aren't you bringing him back? - He's too far along.

1058
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:41,500
我們已經知道機器能記錄一些東西
We already know that it records something.

1059
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:42,410
庫珀
Cooper...

1060
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:44,380
機器有用
it works, okay?

1061
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,160
爸
Dad?

1062
01:17:47,890 --> 01:17:48,840
爸
Dad?

1063
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,440
你該停下了
Time to pull yourself away.

1064
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:55,690
回歸現實  回家吧
Come back to reality. Come home.

1065
01:17:57,660 --> 01:17:59,930
-是媽嗎  -是她
- Is that Mom? - It's Mom.

1066
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:02,640
我的研究就是現實
What I'm doing is reality.

1067
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,760
我得完成  這很重要  你明白嗎
I need to finish. It's important. Do you understand?

1068
01:18:08,530 --> 01:18:10,940
-他們的結婚紀念日  -對
- Their anniversary. - Yeah.

1069
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:14,110
我要上樓了
I'm going upstairs.

1070
01:18:19,470 --> 01:18:20,610
別鬧情緒好嗎
Now, don't be dramatic.

1071
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:23,490
我馬上就完成  我們可以一起用晚餐
I'll be done soon. And we can have dinner.

1072
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:42,730
親愛的  等一下
Honey, wait.

1073
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:47,890
也許工作可以先放一放
Maybe work can wait.

1074
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:50,870
一起用晚餐怎么樣
So, what do you say we have some dinner?

1075
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,310
她沒去泡澡
She's not taking the bath.

1076
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:06,130
-當時不是這樣的  -我知道
- That's not what happened. - I know.

1077
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:08,640
我們可以讓他醒過來了
We can bring him back.

1078
01:19:08,670 --> 01:19:11,370
庫珀  等一下  我們得看看發生了什么
Cooper, just... wait. We have to see what happens.

1079
01:19:11,370 --> 01:19:14,000
必須現在動手  否則就太遲了
We've got to do it now, or it'll be too late.

1080
01:19:14,610 --> 01:19:16,340
威爾  快點
Will, come on.

1081
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,630
托比  抱歉  庫珀  趕快
Toby, I'm sorry. Cooper, now!

1082
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,680
爸  爸  聽我說
Dad? Dad, listen to me.

1083
01:19:25,710 --> 01:19:27,780
爸  拜托  聽聽我的聲音
Dad, please. Listen to my voice.

1084
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:29,020
他是不是要腦...
Is he gonna be brain...?

1085
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:30,130
我不知道  我不知道
I don't know. I don't know.

1086
01:19:30,130 --> 01:19:31,540
庫珀  再來一次
Cooper, hit it again!

1087
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:34,690
爸
Dad?

1088
01:19:39,430 --> 01:19:40,400
怎么了
What happened?

1089
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:55,810
我知道我看到她了
I knew I saw her.

1090
01:19:58,310 --> 01:20:01,440
就像一個記不起來的夢
Like a dream that you can't remember.

1091
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:04,660
我不知道這是怎么回事  爸
I can't figure out what this is, Dad.

1092
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:07,000
我之前從沒離開過書房
I never left my study.

1093
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,830
從沒阻止她上樓
Never stopped her on the stairs.

1094
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:14,220
-然后她就去泡澡了  -我知道
- And she drew a bath. - I know.

1095
01:20:14,490 --> 01:20:15,910
帕特·菲利普斯的記錄里 
And in the Pat Phillips recording,

1096
01:20:15,910 --> 01:20:17,980
他胳膊上有個不一樣的紋身
he has a different tattoo on his arm.

1097
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:21,930
我常說「來世」就是「另一個次元世界」
I always said the afterlife was a different plane of existence.

1098
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:24,240
但是...
But...

1099
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:30,870
萬一是這個世界的另一個次元呢
what if it's a different plane... of this existence?

1100
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,620
現實世界的另一個版本
Alternate realities?

1101
01:20:34,850 --> 01:20:39,130
不  就是我們的世界  不過略有差別
No, our reality... with differences and variations.

1102
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:44,210
走下卡車  看望垂死的病人
Stepping out of a truck... to visit a dying parent.

1103
01:20:44,770 --> 01:20:48,060
存在隨機性  就像那個不同的紋身
Random, like different tattoos.

1104
01:20:49,190 --> 01:20:53,240
阻止別人上樓結束自己的生命
Stopping someone from going upstairs to end their life.

1105
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:58,730
當我們死了
When we die,

1106
01:20:58,730 --> 01:21:03,080
萬一我們是去另一個版本的今生呢
what if we travel to an alternate version of our own life?

1107
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:04,490
第二次機會
A second chance?

1108
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:09,880
那我們就不必面對自己最深的悔恨了
Then we wouldn't... just have to accept our biggest regret.

1109
01:21:10,890 --> 01:21:12,700
我們可以在「來世」改變這一切
In the afterlife, we could change it.

1110
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:20,300
這不就顯然說明自殺...
At the risk of stating the super fucking obvious...

1111
01:21:21,070 --> 01:21:24,030
如果你們是對的  消息傳了出去...
If you are right and word of this got out--

1112
01:21:24,030 --> 01:21:25,850
我們得銷毀這臺機器
We have to destroy the machine.

1113
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:39,860
托馬斯
Thomas.

1114
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:43,280
大家都想知道怎么回事
Everyone wants to know what's going on.

1115
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:51,340
歡迎各位  很高興你們都能過來
Welcome, everybody. Nice to have you all here.

1116
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,680
我今天叫你們過來
I asked you to gather here today

1117
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:57,040
因為我覺得我們該坦誠相待
because I thought that we should be honest.

1118
01:21:57,170 --> 01:21:58,920
坦誠于自己
Honest with ourselves,

1119
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:00,470
坦誠于彼此
honest with each other.

1120
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:00,990
你能再次見到你媽媽了
You got to see your mom again.

1121
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:02,210
我視你們為家人...
I see you as family...

1122
01:22:02,210 --> 01:22:04,400
相信你們也視我為家人
and I think you see me in the same way.

1123
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,620
作為家人...
And as family...

1124
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:10,410
我覺得有時候我們太過執著于
I think sometimes we get so absorbed with...

1125
01:22:10,730 --> 01:22:12,050
我們自己的事
what we're doing individually,

1126
01:22:12,050 --> 01:22:13,770
我們沿著自己的軌道一路向前
we go off on our own track and so forth,

1127
01:22:13,770 --> 01:22:17,670
卻忘記了家人有多么重要
we lose the fact that how important family is.

1128
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:23,130
萊西
Lacey?

1129
01:22:25,730 --> 01:22:26,700
萊西
Lacey.

1130
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:30,610
萊西  沒關系的  把槍放下
Lacey, it's okay. Put the... put the gun down.

1131
01:22:30,610 --> 01:22:34,260
萊西  是我錯了  你不必這么做
Lacey, I was wrong. You do not need to do this.

1132
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:35,870
我沒有殺她
I didn't kill her.

1133
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:41,370
我只是送她去到了別處
I just relocated her.

1134
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:45,450
艾拉
Isla?

1135
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:48,560
艾拉
Isla?

1136
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:50,350
艾拉  沒事的
Isla. Oh, it's okay.

1137
01:22:50,350 --> 01:22:53,360
艾拉  爸  天吶
Isla? Dad! God.

1138
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:55,200
爸  拜托  來幫幫我
Dad, please! I need your help!

1139
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:57,030
誰去叫救援來
Somebody go get help.

1140
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,700
我只是想要回自己的位置
I just wanted my spot back.

1141
01:23:04,970 --> 01:23:06,750
艾拉  爸爸  求你救救她
Isla. Dad, please help her.

1142
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,450
別說話  保持呼吸
Don't talk. Just breathe.

1143
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:12,160
我不再想死了
I don't wanna die anymore.

1144
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,340
你不會有事的  千萬別睡過去
You're okay. I just need you to stay with me.

1145
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:42,640
艾拉
Isla?

1146
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:44,650
艾拉
Isla?

1147
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:45,240
警方問
They were asking, the cops,

1148
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:47,750
艾拉的聯系人是誰
who to contact for Isla.

1149
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:49,190
她的親屬
Next-of-kin deal.

1150
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:51,660
-我會讓庫珀去查一下  -好
- I'll have Cooper look into it. - Okay.

1151
01:24:53,310 --> 01:24:56,840
現在別去問他太多問題了
I don't wanna overwhelm him with questions right now, okay?

1152
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:58,880
你說得對
That's probably a good idea.

1153
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:01,880
我該進去看看他吧
Maybe I should go in and check on him...

1154
01:25:01,890 --> 01:25:04,250
不不不  別去
No, no, no. Don't.

1155
01:25:05,130 --> 01:25:06,370
他需要休息
He needs rest.

1156
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,820
他需要點時間消化
He needs to process, okay?

1157
01:25:09,410 --> 01:25:11,200
晚飯后  你可以去看他
You can check on him after dinner.

1158
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:15,210
然后我們今晚就把這機器拆了
And then we'll finish breaking down the machine tonight.

1159
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,020
但是...
But...

1160
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:23,130
我們還沒能...
we haven't come close...

1161
01:25:23,490 --> 01:25:27,420
弄清楚這一切及其背后的意義
to figuring this all out yet, or what it all means.

1162
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:31,910
如果那真是我們今生的另一個版本
Like, if it really is another version of our own life,

1163
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:35,750
那么在那個「今生」中死去會怎樣呢
then what happens when we die again?

1164
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:36,630
托比
Toby.

1165
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:38,740
-托比  -怎么了
- Toby. - What?

1166
01:25:39,210 --> 01:25:41,360
我們必須得收手一陣子了
We've got to let it go for a while.

1167
01:25:42,650 --> 01:25:43,720
我們必須得這么做
We've just got to.

1168
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:04,030
全拆了
Completely dismantled.

1169
01:26:04,030 --> 01:26:05,450
所有痕跡都要銷毀
All traces need to be gone.

1170
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:06,870
托馬斯  我懂了
Thomas, I hear you.

1171
01:26:28,130 --> 01:26:29,320
威廉
William?

1172
01:26:30,170 --> 01:26:32,150
讓我們進來  別這么做
Let us in, don't do this.

1173
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:34,040
威廉
William.

1174
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,570
他在來這里的船上
He's on the ferry headed here?

1175
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:45,280
-不是同一個「這里」  -什么
- Not the same here. - What?

1176
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:48,830
我不明白
I don't understand.

1177
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:52,390
如果他沒死  我們為什么能看到這些畫面
How are we watching this right now if he's not dead?

1178
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:54,870
托馬斯·哈勃公布「重大發現」之后
...since Thomas Harber's first and only

1179
01:27:54,870 --> 01:27:56,300
首次接受了獨家專訪時
post-Discovery interview

1180
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:59,320
有人突然在節目中自殺
ended suddenly with an on-air suicide.

1181
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:03,160
自此之后  全世界的自殺人數暴增到...
Since then, the worldwide suicide toll has sky--

1182
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:06,960
我正在看呢
I was watching that.

1183
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:11,580
艾拉
Isla?

1184
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:14,120
-艾拉  -現在是淡季
- Isla? - It's off-season.

1185
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:16,320
你去這個荒涼的小島干什么
Why are you going to this dreary island?

1186
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,380
艾拉
Isla?

1187
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:23,800
-我要阻止你被槍擊中  艾拉  -坐下
- I have to stop your shooting, Isla. - Sit down.

1188
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,650
我要你現在就和我一起走
I need you to come with me right now.

1189
01:28:25,650 --> 01:28:27,530
坐下  威爾  這只是記憶而已
Sit down, Will. This is just your memory.

1190
01:28:27,530 --> 01:28:29,230
我是你意識中的一部分  坐下
I'm a part of you. Sit down.

1191
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:32,700
我們怎么又回到這條船上了
What are we doing back on this ferry?

1192
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:34,560
這到底是怎么回事
What the fuck is going on?

1193
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:38,920
只有「這一世」  你才阻止了我自殺
You were never able to stop me from killing myself until this life.

1194
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:41,440
「這一世」  你說什...
"This life"? What do you...?

1195
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,130
「這一世」是什么意思
What do you mean, "this life"?

1196
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,590
你總是從回到渡輪上
You always start back on the ferry.

1197
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:49,770
現實和幻想相互獨立
Reality and fantasy are mutually exclusive.

1198
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:51,810
兩者無法共存
They don't exist in the same space.

1199
01:28:51,810 --> 01:28:53,180
看來我們到了
Well, it looks like we're here.

1200
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:56,940
我改主意了
You know what? I changed my mind.

1201
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:58,930
我不知道我之前怎么想的
I don't know what I was thinking.

1202
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:02,490
第一次  你沒下船
The first time, you never got off the ferry.

1203
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:03,830
第二天  你看到新聞
Then the next day you read that

1204
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:06,540
一個叫艾拉的女人投海自盡了
a woman named Isla had drowned herself.

1205
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,410
你繼續過著自己的生活
You went on and lived your life,

1206
01:29:08,410 --> 01:29:11,080
但本來能幫上忙的想法一直揮之不去
but the thought that you could've done something never left.

1207
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:12,750
一直縈繞著你
It was always there.

1208
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:34,560
有一天  就像其他人一樣
And then one day, just like everybody else...

1209
01:29:40,470 --> 01:29:41,490
我死了
I died.

1210
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:43,480
然后你就回到這里
And then you came back here.

1211
01:29:46,010 --> 01:29:49,030
我困在這個循環里多久了
How long have I been stuck living in this loop?

1212
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:52,710
我們在渡輪上遇見多少次了
How many times have we met on this ferry?

1213
01:29:54,910 --> 01:29:56,760
你一死就會回到這里
Your death brings you back here.

1214
01:29:56,760 --> 01:30:01,370
你一遍又一遍地回到這個原點
You keep coming back over and over again and again.

1215
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:03,860
我一點都不記得
I don't remember any of it.

1216
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:05,920
我不記得其他「幾世」
I don't remember these other lives.

1217
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:08,050
沒人能直接想起來
Nobody can remember them directly.

1218
01:30:09,130 --> 01:30:12,650
但有時  記憶能通過某些方式留在腦海里
But sometimes certain memories do have a way of sticking out.

1219
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:15,640
我覺得你好眼熟  我覺得你好眼熟
You look so familiar to me. You look so familiar to me.

1220
01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:17,880
你很走運啊  我出門一般不帶這玩意
It's your lucky day. I don't normally carry these around.

1221
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:21,030
不管我看到的景象是什么  就在這個海灘上
This is where I saw whatever... This is the beach.

1222
01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:23,310
你怎么知道自己會住這一間
How'd you know this is where you were gonna be staying?

1223
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:24,910
我們這群人兜兜轉轉
We're a bunch of people running around

1224
01:30:24,910 --> 01:30:27,230
一次又一次重復過去的錯誤
making the same mistakes over and over.

1225
01:30:27,230 --> 01:30:31,340
為什么會覺得換了個地方  就會有所不同
And I don't know why we think it'll be different somewhere else...

1226
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,800
我應該改變什么
What am I supposed to change?

1227
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:34,990
你已經改變了
You already changed it.

1228
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,310
你不斷地回來  直到救了我
You kept coming back until you saved me.

1229
01:30:37,310 --> 01:30:39,150
我沒救你  你死了
I didn't save you, you died.

1230
01:30:39,150 --> 01:30:41,670
救人不止有一種方法  威爾
There's more than one way to save somebody, Will.

1231
01:30:42,010 --> 01:30:45,940
庫珀  準備好  我們得讓他蘇醒
Cooper, ready on our end. We need to bring him back.

1232
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:49,510
我怎么能聽到我爸的聲音  他又不在這里
How can I hear my dad? He's in a different place.

1233
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:51,550
兩個次元的同一處地方
Two separate parts in the same place.

1234
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:53,630
好了  爸  除顫器充好電了
Okay, Dad, defibrillator's charged.

1235
01:30:53,630 --> 01:30:55,770
不不不  我還沒準備好回去
No, no, no. I'm not ready to go back yet.

1236
01:30:55,770 --> 01:30:57,350
我要多跟你待一會兒
I need more time with you.

1237
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:59,650
托比  等等  先別這樣做
Toby, please wait! Not yet!

1238
01:30:59,650 --> 01:31:01,360
他的生命體征很危險
His vitals are concerning me.

1239
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,250
要是現在把他拉回來  可能會失去他
If we pull him now, we might lose him.

1240
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:04,580
艾拉  艾拉  求你了
Isla. Isla, please.

1241
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:06,270
我還沒準備好離開你
I'm not ready to leave you.

1242
01:31:06,350 --> 01:31:08,800
-我怎么了  -你快死了
- What's happening to me? - You're about to die.

1243
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,460
他心臟停跳了  托馬斯
His heart's stopped, Thomas.

1244
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:11,730
器官逐漸衰竭
Organs are shutting down.

1245
01:31:11,740 --> 01:31:13,230
他們想把你救回去
They're trying to bring you back.

1246
01:31:13,230 --> 01:31:13,790
沒關系
That's okay.

1247
01:31:13,790 --> 01:31:16,280
我要是死了  就會直接回到你身邊吧
Because If I die, I'll just come back here to you, right?

1248
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:18,220
不  這次不是
No, not this time.

1249
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:20,370
你不用再回來了
You don't have to come back anymore.

1250
01:31:20,370 --> 01:31:22,310
你幫去了我該去的地方
You helped me get to where I needed to be

1251
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:24,240
現在你該去往「別處」了
and now you'll go someplace else.

1252
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:27,430
等我去了「別處」  我還能記得你嗎
When I get there, will I be able to remember you?

1253
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:29,380
希望能
I hope so.

1254
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:32,180
爸  各項器官都衰歇了
Dad, everything is shutting down.

1255
01:31:32,180 --> 01:31:33,970
他的大腦活動幾乎停止了
His brain's showing barely any activity.

1256
01:31:33,970 --> 01:31:35,660
你現在就走  到此為止了
You're leaving now. This is it.

1257
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:38,940
不救回我兒子  我不會離開這間屋子
I'm not leaving this room until we revive my son.

1258
01:31:38,990 --> 01:31:43,170
等我去了「別處」  我會記得你
When I get there... I'm going to remember you.

1259
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:45,170
我們得把他拉回來
We've gotta pull him out right now.

1260
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:49,120
一  二  三
One... two... three.

1261
01:33:20,390 --> 01:33:22,790
你還好嗎
Look. You okay?

1262
01:33:23,970 --> 01:33:25,110
-嗯  -過來
- Yeah. - Come here.

1263
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:28,670
我來幫你一把  過來  過來
Let me help you. Come here, come here.

1264
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:30,640
我抓到你了
I got you.

1265
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:35,750
你還好嗎
You okay?

1266
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:38,060
-天啊  -把桶給我
- Holy cow. - Give me that pail.

1267
01:33:38,180 --> 01:33:40,660
-你摔得不輕啊  -是啊
- You went down pretty good, huh? - Yeah.

1268
01:33:40,660 --> 01:33:44,010
你還好嗎  我抱著你呢
Yep. You okay? I got you.

1269
01:33:46,710 --> 01:33:48,080
你的爸爸媽媽呢
Where's your mom and dad?

1270
01:33:48,350 --> 01:33:49,300
奧利弗
Oliver!

1271
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:51,330
奧利弗
Oliver!

1272
01:33:56,450 --> 01:33:58,700
沒事的  他沒事  只是...
It's okay. He's all right. He just...

1273
01:33:58,850 --> 01:34:00,900
-好了  -我告訴過你  你不能...
- Okay. - I told you, you can't--

1274
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:04,650
你不能那樣亂跑  明白嗎  我說過的
You can't just run off on me like that, okay? I've told you.

1275
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:08,020
他只是...  他沒事的
He was... he was just... He's all right.

1276
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:09,980
他在水里有點掙扎
He was struggling a little bit in the water.

1277
01:34:10,340 --> 01:34:11,970
我想確保讓他回到你身邊
I wanted to make sure he got back to you.

1278
01:34:13,210 --> 01:34:14,710
-你沒事吧  -嗯
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

1279
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:17,830
-謝謝  -沒事
- Thank you. - Yeah.

1280
01:34:19,230 --> 01:34:20,120
他是個好孩子
He's a good kid.

1281
01:34:20,310 --> 01:34:21,720
-你還好  -謝謝
- You're okay. - Thanks.

1282
01:34:24,970 --> 01:34:28,540
你可別再那么干了  你嚇到我了  好嗎
You can't do that. You scared me. Okay?

1283
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:29,900
你能下來自己走嗎
Can you walk a little bit?
