- 要多少  - 不知道

It's gonna be 40 below in five minutes.

好了 來吧 Dillon先生

51
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,920
主啊 賜予我們力量來忍受
Give us strength, O Lord, to endure.

52
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,530
我們只是上帝手中
We recognize that we are

53
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,210
卑微的罪人
poor sinners in the hands of an angry God.

54
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,840
但願循環不被破壞
Let the circle be unbroken...

55
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,010
直到末日降臨
until the day.

56
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,020
- 阿門  - 阿門
- Amen. - Amen.

57
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,980
多謝各位 下面開始闢謠
Thank you, gentlemen. This is rumor control.

58
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,610
情況如下
Here are the facts.

59
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,200
你們也知道
As some of you know,

60
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,660
有一艘337型號緊急逃生艇
a 337 model E.E.V....

61
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,950
於早上6點
crash-landed here at 0600...

62
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,620
墜落在我們這兒
on the morning watch.

63
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,250
艇上僅一人生還
There was one survivor,

64
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,710
另外有兩名死者和一個報廢的生化人
two dead and a droid that was hopelessly smashed beyond repair.

65
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,380
生還者為女性
The survivor is a woman.

66
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,050
我所瞭解的就是這樣
That's what I saw.

67
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,680
我已經宣誓要獨身禁慾了
I just want to say that I've taken a vow of celibacy.

68
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,060
- 我們都宣誓了  - 包括女人在內
- So have we all. - That also includes women.

69
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,270
- 是  - 我們已經宣誓了
- Yes. - We've all taken the vow!

70
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,020
- 閉上臭嘴 Morse  - 我還是想說 首先
- Shut your gob, Morse. - I'd like to say that I, for one,

71
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,610
我不喜歡公司允許她在這裏
do not appreciate company policy allowing her to freely...

72
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,820
與囚犯和獄卒混在一起生活
intermingle with inmates and the rest of the staff.

73
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,700
這位兄弟想說的是
What brother means to say

74
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,570
我們認為任何外人出現
is we view the presence of any outsider,

75
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,290
尤其是女人 都會破壞這裏的和諧
especially a woman, as a violation of the harmony,

76
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,290
有可能破壞我們的聖神團體
a potential break in the spiritual unity.

77
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,000
我們很清楚大家的想法
We are well aware of your feelings in this matter.

78
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,710
所以 我已經請求了救援小組到來
You will be pleased to know that I have requested a rescue team.

79
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,380
希望他們一周之內就能趕到
Hopefully, they will be here inside of a week

80
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:24,550
- 哦 拜託  - 盡快將她帶走
- Oh, come on! - And evacuate her A.S.A.P.

81
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,550
別這樣玩我們
Don't give us that!

82
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,520
她身體狀況如何
What's her medical status?

83
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,520
她傷勢不重
She doesn't seem too badly damaged.

84
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,620
目前昏迷不醒
She's unconscious.

85
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,440
還沒有進一步的詳細診斷
Can't give you a more specific diagnosis at the moment.

86
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,900
- 她能活下來嗎  - 應該可以
- Will she live? - I would think so.

87
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,650
聽著 所有人都不希望
Look. It's in everybody's interest...

88
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,060
那個女人
the woman doesn't come out

89
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,450
在救援小組到達之前從醫務室出來
of the infirmary until the rescue team arrives.

90
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,700
- 更不希望沒人護送 明白嗎  - 是
- And certainly not without an escort, right? - Sir.

91
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,290
各位 我們繼續回到日常狀態
Gentlemen, we should all stick to our set routine...

92
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,540
不要過分焦慮
and not get unduly agitated.

93
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,130
- 是  - 可以嗎
- Right. - Correct?

94
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:02,090
很好 謝謝各位
All right. Thank you, gentlemen.

95
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,390
好了
All right.

96
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,180
快點去吧 不然就沒多少剩了
Better get here soon or there ain't gonna be much left.

97
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,060
這是什麼
What's that?

98
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:56,350
我自己調的一點雞尾酒 保證沒見過
It's just a little cocktail of my own mix. Sort of eye-opener.

99
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,860
你是醫生
You a doctor?

100
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,480
我叫Clemens 我是這兒的醫務主管
My name is Clemens. I'm the chief medical officer here.

101
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,610
- 這兒  - 復仇161星
- Here?  - Fury 161.

102
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,070
這是Weyland-Yutani的窮鄉僻壤的苦役監獄
It's one of Weyland-Yutani's backwater work prisons,

103
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,080
說起來就讓我悲傷
it grieves me to say.

104
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,080
不介意吧
Do you mind?

105
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,790
這東西是鎮靜劑
This is basically a stabilizer.

106
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,790
我要把你頭髮給剃了
I really ought to shave your head.

107
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,380
裏面有很多虱子
We have a big problem with lice here.

108
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,970
你感覺好點後 我給你拿個剪刀
And when you're feeling better, I'll give you some clippers,

109
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,570
你自己剪掉你的
and you can tend to your

110
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,100
- 陰毛  - 我怎麼來這兒的
- private parts yourself. - How'd I get here?

111
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,230
你的逃生艇墜落了
You crash-landed in an E.E.V.

112
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,490
明顯是進入大氣層之前
Evidently separated from

113
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,810
就已經脫離母艦了
your mother ship before you hit our atmosphere.

114
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,230
你知道你處於深度休眠多久了嗎
You have any idea how long you were in hypersleep?

115
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,300
你這麼突然甦醒
'Cause coming out the way

116
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,940
肯定會讓身體系統受到影響
you did can be quite a jolt to the system.

117
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,530
- 我會病幾個星期  - 沒錯
- Yeah, I'll be sick for a couple of weeks. - Indeed.

118
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,370
- 其他人呢  - 他們沒能生還
- Where are the others? - They didn't make it.

119
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,540
- 什麼  - 他們都死了
- What? - They didn't survive.

120
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,630
我得去飛船看看
I have to get to the ship.

121
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,800
- 我要去看看  - 你現在的狀況還不能去
- Have to get to the ship. - You're in no condition for that.

122
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,760
你要給我穿點衣服呢 還是就讓我這麼出去
You want to get me some clothes, or should I just go like this?

123
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,430
考慮到本地群眾的性情
Given the nature of our indigenous population,

124
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,680
我建議你穿點衣服
I would suggest clothes.

125
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,650
他們很多年沒見過女人了
None of them have seen a woman in years.

126
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,610
其實 我也不例外
Neither have I, for that matter.

127
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,320
這裏曾關著5000名囚犯
This used to be a 5,000 convict facility,

128
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:36,040
現在只剩下25名
but it's been reduced to a custodial staff of 25.

129
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,080
為什麼
Why?

130
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,160
- 保持引導燈正常運轉  - 引導燈幹什麼的
- Keep the pilot light on. - The pilot light for what?

131
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,840
高爐鼓風 天然沼氣
Blast furnace. Natural methane.

132
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,550
我們有個鑄造廠 Ripley中尉
We have a foundry, Lieutenant Ripley.

133
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:52,010
囚犯鑄造鉛板 用來裝有毒廢料
The inmates forge lead sheets for toxic waste containers.

134
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,850
你怎麼知道我的名字
How do you know my name?

135
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,720
印在你短褲背面了
It's stenciled on the back of your shorts.

136
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,280
鬆開鐵纜
Release the cable!

137
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,880
- 屍體在哪兒  - 在停屍房
- Where are the bodies? - We have a morgue.

138
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,350
我們放在那兒了
We put them there until the

139
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,930
等調查小組一周後過來再說
investigative team arrives in about a week, I think.

140
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,270
- 還有個生化人呢  - 斷電了
- There was a droid. - Disconnected.

141
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,850
他七零八碎的
There were bits and pieces of him all over the place.

142
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,020
都丟到垃圾堆頂上了
We put what was left on the rubbish tip.

143
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,480
那個下士被安全架刺穿了
The corporal was impaled by that safety support.

144
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,530
死得不明不白
He never knew what hit him.

145
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,990
那個女孩呢
And the girl?

146
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,410
她 溺死在低溫艙內了
She drowned in her cryo-tube.

147
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,910
我估計她死的時候也沒有甦醒
I don't think she was conscious when it happened.

148
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,160
很抱歉
Um, I'm sorry.

149
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,770
怎麼了
What's the matter?

150
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,270
- 她在哪兒  - 在停屍房
- Where is she? - In the morgue.

151
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,270
我要看看她
I have to see her.

152
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,610
我要看看她的遺體
I have to see what's left of her.

153
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:42,660
你這麼急迫有什麼理由嗎
Is there any particular reason that you're so insistent?

154
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,870
有 我要確定她的死因
Yes. I have to be sure how she died.

155
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,040
我實在不想囉嗦這個事情了
I hate to be repetitious about such a sensitive subject,

156
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:54,260
但她確實是溺水而死的
but it is perfectly clear that she drowned.

157
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,560
她是你女兒嗎
Was she your daughter?

158
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,940
不是
No. She wasn't.

159
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,310
讓 讓我獨處一下好嗎
C-Could I have a moment alone, please?

160
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,360
當然可以
Yes, of course.

161
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,560
原諒我
Forgive me.

162
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,380
她在幹嘛
What's she doing?

163
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,890
好了嗎
Okay?

164
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,190
沒有
No.

165
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,150
我們需要驗屍
We have to do an autopsy.

166
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,980
- 什麼  - 我說了
- What? - I told you,

167
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,320
我們得查清楚她的死因
we have to make sure how she died.

168
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,030
我也說過 她是溺死的
And I told you, she drowned.

169
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,660
我認為不是 我要看看她體內
I'm not so sure. I-I have to see inside of her.

170
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,160
你精神恍惚 你一半的身體機能
You're disorientated. Half your system's still in—

171
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,250
我這麼做理由很充分
I have a very, very good reason.

172
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,420
那就請你告訴我
Well, perhaps you'd like to share that reason.

173
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,550
她可能受到感染
Possible contagion.

174
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,510
哪種感染
What kind exactly?

175
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,600
- 霍亂  - 霍亂
- Cholera. - Cholera?

176
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,230
已經有200年沒出現過霍亂病例了
There hasn't been a case of cholera reported for 200 years.

177
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,820
求你了
Please.

178
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,320
一切正常
Everything's in place.

179
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,780
沒有感染跡象
There's no sign of infection.

180
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,570
- 也沒有病癥  - 胸腔呢
- No indication of disease. - Chest.

181
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,620
打開胸腔
Open the chest.

182
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,130
小心
Careful.

183
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,830
肺部
Lungs.

184
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,210
充滿液體
Flooded with fluid.

185
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,340
因此 她是溺死的
Ergo, she drowned.

186
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:53,310
好了 我不是個傻子
Now, since I'm not a complete idiot,

187
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:57,230
你能告訴我到底在找什麼嗎
would you like to tell me what we're really looking for?

188
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,490
Clemens先生
Mr. Clemens.

189
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,490
獄長
Superintendent.

190
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,580
你還沒見過Ripley中尉吧
I don't believe you've met Lieutenant Ripley.

191
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,660
Clemens先生 發生什麼了
What's going on, Mr. Clemens?

192
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,870
是的 發生什麼了 Clemens先生
That's right, sir. What's going on, Mr. Clemens？

193
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,250
首先
Well, first—

194
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:28,170
好消息是 中尉現在狀況好多了
the lieutenant is feeling much better, I'm happy to say.

195
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,720
其次 為了大家的健康考慮
Second, in the interest of public health,

196
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,510
- 我在驗屍  - 未經批准
- I am performing an autopsy. - Without my authority.

197
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,020
來不及向您請示
Well, there didn't seem to be time.

198
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,980
但結果一切無礙
But it's turned out all right.

199
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,520
- 死者體內沒有感染痕跡  - 很好
- There's no sign of contagion in the body. - Good.

200
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,940
而且最好讓Ripley中尉
But it might be helpful if Lt. Ripley

201
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:44,360
不要在囚犯面前走動
didn't parade around in front of the prisoners,

202
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,570
我聽說她剛剛就這麼做了
as I am told she did in the last hour.

203
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,570
同時 我還認為你應該
It might also be helpful...

204
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,700
及時告訴我她身體狀況的任何變化
if you kept me informed as to any change in her physical status.

205
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,160
這要求過分嗎
Or would that be asking too much?

206
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,600
- 屍體必須火化  - 胡說
- We have to cremate the bodies. - Nonsense.

207
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:59,660
遺體必須冷凍著 等救援小組來了再說
We'll keep the bodies on ice till the rescue team arrives.

208
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:04,130
- 冷凍  - 這會影響公眾健康
- On ice. - There is the public health issue.

209
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,100
中尉認為依舊
The lieutenant feels that there

210
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,220
有疾病傳播感染的可能
is still a possibility of a communicable infection.

211
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,550
你不是說沒有疾病跡像嗎
I thought you said there was no sign of disease.

212
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,760
看起來孩子是溺死的
It would appear that the child drowned.

213
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,390
但是未經過化驗室檢測
But without the benefit of proper laboratory tests,

214
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,390
我也不能十分肯定
it's impossible to be absolutely certain.

215
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,730
我認為冒著被感染的可能性
I would consider it unwise to tolerate even

216
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,570
是不太明智的
the possibility of an unwelcome virus.

217
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:31,110
要是霍亂暴發 您的任職報告一定不會好看
An outbreak of cholera would look extremely bad on a report.

218
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,530
不是嗎 先生
Would it not, sir?

219
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,620
我們有25名囚犯
We've 25 prisoners in this facility.

220
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,790
全是雙Y染色體
All double-y-chromos.

221
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:44,080
小偷 強姦犯 殺人犯 兒童猥褻犯 全是人渣
All thieves, rapists, murderers, child molesters. All scum.

222
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,010
他們信教
Just because they've taken on religion

223
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,920
並不代表他們不危險
doesn't make them any less dangerous.

224
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,420
我不想挑戰他們的信仰
I try not to offend their convictions.

225
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,010
也不想擾亂這裏的秩序
I don't want to upset the order.

226
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,600
我不想引發風波
I don't want ripples in the water.

227
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,690
我也不想有女人勾起他們的邪念
And I don't want a woman walking around giving them ideas.

228
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:06,810
懂了 為了我的安全
I see. For my own personal safety.

229
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,940
正是
Exactly.

230
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:14,660
火化的任務交給你了 Clemens先生
I will leave the details of the cremation to you, Mr. Clemens.

231
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,400
他們可以用熔爐
They may use the furnace,

232
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,080
不過晚上10點以前要回牢房
but I want everyone back in lockup by 2200 hours.

233
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,210
遵命 先生
You called it, sir.

234
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,740
- 聖誕節提早到來了 Murph  - 什麼意思
- Ah, Christmas has come early, Murph. - What do you mean?

235
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,820
- 死了的牛才是好牛  - 太對了
- Any dead ox is a good ox. - You're bloody right.

236
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,160
滿身跳蚤的臭東西
Smelly bastards, all covered in lice.

237
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,690
還剩7只臭東西要處理
There's only seven of the friggin' things left,

238
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,250
然後就完事兒了
and then we're done with them.

239
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,620
最討厭沖洗這臭東西了
God, I hates hosin' these bastards down.

240
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,170
每次弄得我的鞋子上都是屎
I always get shite all over me boots.

241
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:11,420
- 說到沖洗  - 怎麼了
- Talkin' of hosing things down, Frank  - Yeah?

242
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,090
如果你有機會 你會對她說什麼
You had the chance, what would you say to her?

243
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,380
- 什麼意思 有機會  - 你懂的
- What do you mean, if I got the chance? - You know.

244
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,300
- 如果有機會  - 偶然的
- If you got the chance. - You mean, casual like?

245
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,060
對 你會對她說什麼
Yeah. I mean, how would you put it to her

246
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,640
如果在食堂或者哪裏遇到
if you bumped into her in the mess hall or somewhere?

247
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,600
沒問題
No problem!

248
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,770
我對女人很有辦法的
I've never had any problem with the ladies.

249
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,780
我會說 "親愛的 你好嗎
I'd say to her, "Good day, my dear. How's it goin'?

250
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,440
有什麼可以幫你的嗎"
Anything I can do to be of service?"

251
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:38,530
然後給她那種眼神 從上看到下
Then I'd give her the look, you know up and down.

252
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,950
然後眨眼睛 色迷迷的笑
And I'd give her the wink, the dirty smile.

253
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,540
- 她就會明白  - 沒錯
- She'd soon get the picture. - Yeah, right.

254
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:48,290
她就會說 "來親我的屁股吧 老色鬼"
And then she'd say, "Kiss my ass, you horny old fucker!"

255
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,040
我很樂意親她的屁股
I'd be happy to kiss her ass.

256
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:54,090
親遍她想要的每個地方
I'd be happy to kiss her anywhere she wants.

257
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,700
對 男人不壞 女人不愛
Yeah, but treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen.

258
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,010
- 對吧 Frank  - 跟你說了 Murph
- Right, Frank? - Told you before, Murph.

259
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,850
像婊子一樣操她 像女王一樣寵她
Treat a queen like a whore and a whore like a queen.

260
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,770
錯不了
Can't go wrong.

261
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:09,520
那女孩怎麼死的
What do you think killed Babe?

262
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,190
鬼知道 反正翹辮子了
Beats me. She just keeled over.

263
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,860
- 她多大了  - 登記的11歲
- How old was she?  - The charts say 1 1 .

264
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,990
正值青春 算了
In her prime. Never mind.

265
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,910
- 等一下就切碎 丟爐裏了  - 對
- We'll chop her up later and throw her in the stew. - Right.

266
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,080
嘿 Frank
Hey，Frank.

267
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,670
這是什麼
What's this?

268
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,150
"我們將這孩子和這男人
"We commit this child...

269
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:39,820
"托付給您 上帝
"And this man to your keeping, O Lord.

270
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,070
"他們的肉體
"Their bodies...

271
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:48,200
"已遠離黑暗
"Have been taken from the shadow of our nights.

272
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:53,750
"他們獲得了解脫
"They have been released...

273
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,960
遠離黑暗與痛苦"
from all darkness and pain."

274
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:05,300
"這孩子和這男人
"The child and the man...

275
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:09,970
"已離開我們的世界
"Have gone beyond our world.

276
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:13,850
"他們已達到永恆
"They are forever eternal...

277
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,150
"永垂不朽
"And everlasting.

278
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,830
塵歸塵 土歸土"
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."

279
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,660
為什麼
Why?

280
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,460
為何無辜者受到懲罰
Why are the innocent punished?

281
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,970
為何必須犧牲
Why the sacrifice?

282
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,350
為何要有痛苦
Why the pain?

283
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,020
世間原無希望
There aren't any promises.

284
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:59,230
世事無常
Nothing's certain.

285
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,440
少數能蒙主寵召 得到拯救
Only that some get called, some get saved.

286
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:09,320
她不會瞭解我們留在人世
She won't ever know the hardship and grief...

287
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,160
必須面對的困苦和傷痛
for those of us left behind.

288
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,790
我們將遺體交託於虛無
We commit these bodies to the void...

289
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:18,330
並滿心歡喜
with a glad heart.

290
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,260
因為每一顆種子裏
For within each seed,

291
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,810
必將長出花朵
there is a promise of a flower.

292
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:39,860
每次死亡
And within each death,

293
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:44,190
無論多麼微不足道
no matter how small,

294
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,530
總伴隨著新生
there's always a new life.

295
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:53,240
新的開始
A new beginning.

296
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,000
阿門
Amen.

297
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:04,210
阿門
Amen.

298
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,120
我跟你說 這太他媽奇怪了
I'll tell you, it's fucking weird.

299
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,870
唯一的生還者居然是個女人
The only one to survive that crash is a woman.

300
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,080
她能帶來什麼麻煩
What trouble can she cause?

301
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,090
她帶來了太多改變了
She's already changed everything.

302
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,930
我們他媽能怎麼辦
What the fuck are we supposed to do—

303
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:58,020
首先
I, for one—

304
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,650
我認真的
I mean it!

305
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,230
好了
Okay.

306
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,230
最近很多流言啊
There's a lot of talking going

307
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:47,270
說我們不和諧
around that we've got some disharmony here?

308
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,110
可以告訴我是什麼問題嗎
Any you guys want to tell me what the problem is?

309
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,660
說呀 兄弟們
Come on. Speak to me, brothers.

310
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,500
好吧 我說
All right. I'll tell ya.

311
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:05,040
黑暗無所謂 有蟲子無所謂
I don't mind the dark. I don't mind the bugs.

312
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,300
每周要去一趟那個
I don't mind wanderin' around in some cold,

313
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,210
又濕又冷的隧道也無所謂
wet, damp tunnel for a week at a time.

314
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,970
我一點意見都沒有 但我討厭Golic
I don't mind anything. But I mind Golic.

315
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,300
你也是這麼想的嗎
That the way you feel about it?

316
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:18,470
對 他瘋瘋癲癲 渾身惡臭
Yeah. The guy's crazy and he smells bad.

317
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:23,140
我不想和他一起出去了
I ain't going out with him anymore.

318
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,860
你還要說什麼嗎
You got anything to say for yourself?

319
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,320
你們還是得跟他一起
WelI, he's going with you.

320
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,610
Golic就是個可憐的
Golic is just another poor, miserable,

321
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:41,330
倒霉蛋 跟我們一樣
suffering son of a bitch, just like you and me.

322
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,620
- 除了他很臭  - 還瘋瘋癲癲
- 'Cept he smells worse. - And he's crazy.

323
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,170
給我閉嘴
Knock off the shit!

324
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:50,300
你們有任務在身
You got a job to do.

325
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:54,010
我不想再聽到任何有關Golic的事
I don't want to hear another word about Golic.

326
00:32:55,890 --> 00:33:00,850
明白嗎
Okay?

327
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,450
你好啊
Well, hello.

328
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:01,830
我就知道會這樣 Aaron先生
As I thought, Mr. Aaron.

329
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:05,120
- 我就知道  - 你說對了
- As I thought. - You called it, sir.

330
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,740
我想感謝一下
I just wanted to, uh, say thanks

331
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,840
你在葬禮上說的話 我
for what you said at the funeral. It was, uh—

332
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,590
我的朋友會很感激的
My friends would have appreciated it.

333
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,470
你不會想認識我的 這位女士
Yeah, well, you don't wanna know me, lady.

334
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:27,640
我是專殺女人的強姦犯
I'm a murderer and rapist of women.

335
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,770
真的嗎
Really?

336
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,320
我猜我一定讓你很緊張
Well, I guess I must make you nervous.

337
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:56,420
- 妹子 你有信仰嗎  - 談不上
- Do you have any faith, sister? - Not much.

338
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:01,380
我們有很深的信仰 甚至足夠讓你加入
Well, we've got a lot of faith here. Enough even for you.

339
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,100
我以為女人不能加入
I thought women weren't allowed.

340
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,100
的確 以前這裏沒有女人
Well, we've never had any before,

341
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:10,440
但我們包容所有人
but we tolerate anybody.

342
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,150
- 甚至令人無法容忍的人  - 謝謝
- Even the intolerable. - Thank you.

343
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:19,900
只是說原則 不是針對你
That's just a statement of principle. Nothing personal.

344
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:23,320
我們一直在這裏好好地等待
You see, we've got a good place to wait here.

345
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:27,040
以前沒遇到過什麼誘惑
And until now, no temptation.

346
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,500
你們在等什麼
What are you waiting for?

347
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,510
我們在等上帝過來
We're waiting for God to return...

348
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,430
救贖我們這些僕人
and raise his servants to redemption.

349
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,530
Dillon和剩下的奇人異士
Dillon and the rest of the alternative people...

350
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:03,150
五年前接受了宗教信仰
embraced religion, as it were, about five years ago.

351
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,370
- 擦點碘酒  - 我服藥了
- Tincture? - I'm on medication.

352
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:08,950
- 不太像  - 哪種宗教
- Hardly. - What kind of religion?

353
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,060
某種啟示論的
Some sort of apocalyptic,

354
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:14,460
相信千年至福的 基督基礎教派
millenarian, Christian fundamentalist, uh—

355
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,920
- 對  - 正是
- Right. - Exactly.

356
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,840
重點是 公司想關閉監獄
Point is, when the company wanted to close the facility down,

357
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,590
Dillon和其他人希望留下
Dillon and the rest of the converts wanted to stay.

358
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,800
他們獲准以守衛身份留下
And they were allowed to remain as custodians...

359
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:30,810
加上兩名管理員和
with two minders...

360
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:33,560
一名醫務主管
and a medical officer.

361
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,730
這就是我們了
And here we are.

362
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:38,110
你怎麼得到這麼棒的差事的
How did you get this wonderful assignment?

363
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,320
你喜歡這新髮型嗎
How do you like your new haircut?

364
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,160
還行
It's okay.

365
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,970
我為你得罪了Andrews
Now that I've gone out on a limb for you with Andrews,

366
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:08,910
進一步破壞了
damaged my already

367
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,310
我和那大好人的關係
less-than-perfect relationship with that good man,

368
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,810
也跟你說了
and briefed you...

369
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:17,730
復仇161星的無聊歷史
on the humdrum history of Fury 161,

370
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:20,190
你就不能告訴我 你在女孩體內找什麼嗎
can you not tell me what you were looking for in the girl?

371
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:23,320
你覺得我有吸引力嗎
You attracted to me?

372
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,490
哪方面
In what way?

373
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,660
那方面
In that way.

374
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:34,000
你很直接
Very direct.

375
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,370
我出門在外很久了
I've been out here a long time.

376
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,960
我也是
So have I.

377
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,260
呃
Yech!

378
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:44,570
嘿 Spike Spike
Hey, Spike. Spike? Spikey!

379
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:52,950
你在下面嗎 做什麼呢
Are you down there? What are you doing?

380
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:40,040
我很感謝你對我的喜愛
I really appreciate your affections,

381
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,960
但我清楚這迴避了我的問題
but I am aware that they... deflected my question.

382
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,880
當然 你的方法很巧妙
In the nicest possible way, of course.

383
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,800
你真掃興
You're spoiling the mood.

384
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:59,720
我得盡職責
I have a job to do.

385
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:02,190
我想知道為什麼要焚燒了屍體
I just want to know why we had to cremate the bodies.

386
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:05,650
現在我在你床上
And now that I'm in your cot,

387
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:08,110
我就要告訴你答案嗎
you think I owe you an answer.

388
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,900
你是得告訴我理由
I think you owe me an answer.

389
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:13,200
在不在我床上你都得說
Being in my bed's got nothing to do with it.

390
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:21,540
我在深睡眠中做了噩夢
I had a terrible dream in hypersleep.

391
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,370
我得知道是什麼害死她
And I had to be sure what killed her.

392
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,710
總之 我錯了
Anyway, I made a mistake.

393
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:29,590
有可能
Possibly.

394
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:33,720
現在我又犯了個錯
And now I've made another mistake.

395
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,720
真的 什麼錯
Really? What's that?

396
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,430
和囚犯發展關係
Fraternizing with a prisoner.

397
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:42,680
肉體接觸 這不合規矩 不是嗎
Physical contact. It's against the rules, isn't it?

398
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:46,900
當然 幾時發生的
Definitely. When was this?

399
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,570
你應該知道
I think you know.

400
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,910
我又不是囚犯
I'm not a prisoner.

401
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:02,040
你後腦勺有一個條形碼
You have a bar code on the back of your head.

402
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,000
的確該解釋一下這個
That does deserve an explanation.

403
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,010
但現在不是時候
But I don't think now is the moment.

404
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:20,220
對不起 我們都挺掃興的 不是嗎
Sorry. We are rather spoiling things, aren't we?

405
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,430
Clemens先生
Mr. Clemens.

406
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:29,650
- Aaron先生  - 獄長Andrews 要你馬上
- Mr. Aaron. - Superintendent Andrews would like you to report...

407
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:33,440
到22號通風孔 馬上
to vent shaft 22 on the second quadrant— now.

408
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,610
- 發生意外了  - 嚴重嗎
- We've had an accident. - Something serious?

409
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:41,030
可以這麼說 有一名囚犯 被切碎了
You could call it that. One of our prisoners has been... diced.

410
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,870
抱歉 得走了
Sorry. I have to go.

411
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,250
職務在身
Official duties.

412
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:21,120
- 誰死了  - Murphy
- Who was it? - Murphy.

413
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,200
你怎麼知道
How do you know?

414
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,790
那是他的鞋
That's his boot.

415
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:30,250
我派他來的 他是個傻帽
I gave him the assignment, sir. He was a wanker.

416
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:32,750
Aaron先生 沒必要道歉 不是你的錯
No apologies, Mr. Aaron. It wasn't your fault.

417
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,720
沒什麼好說的 是吧
Well, not much to say, is there?

418
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:49,850
- 他當場死亡  - 屁話
- Death was instantaneous. - No shit.

419
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,310
我猜他被吸入風扇了
I take it he was pulled into the fan.

420
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,360
突然的強風 說不定 不過
Sudden rush of air, I'd imagine, except—

421
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,530
對 有次我也差點這樣
Right. Almost happened to me once.

422
00:42:56,610 --> 00:43:00,990
跟他說多少遍了 "離風扇遠點"
I've told him so many times, "Stay away from the fans."

423
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:02,990
他媽就是沒人聽
Nobody bloody listens.

424
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,200
不過風扇是在吹風
Except the fan was blowing.

425
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:15,250
- 那是什麼  - 不知道
- What's that? - I don't know.

426
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:18,260
半小時後 請來我房間
I want to see you in my quarters in 30 minutes,

427
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:20,130
Clemens先生
if you'll please, Mr. Clemens.

428
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,520
你有什麼推測嗎
Have you got any ideas?

429
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,150
原來你在這兒 這麼一個人到處亂走
Here you are. You know, wandering around without an escort...

430
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:21,070
會氣死Andrews獄長的
is really gonna piss Superintendent Andrews off.

431
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:23,490
那意外是怎麼回事
Will you tell me about your accident?

432
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:27,200
一名囚犯死了
One of the prisoners has been killed.

433
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:29,660
真的 怎麼死的
Really? How?

434
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,290
在通風孔
In the air shaft.

435
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,870
可憐的傢伙 掉進9尺長的風扇
Poor soul backed into a nine-foot fan.

436
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,380
我發現一樣東西
I found something at the accident site,

437
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,880
就在離現場不遠
just a bit away from where it happened.

438
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:45,550
一個印痕 燒過的痕跡
A mark. A burn.

439
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:49,930
就像你在那女孩的低溫艙 所發現的
Rather like the one you found on the girl's cryo-tube.

440
00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:00,230
聽著 我跟你同一陣線
Look. I'm on your side.

441
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,820
我想幫你 但我要知道這是怎麼回事
I want to help, but I need to know what's going on...

442
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,280
或者你覺得這是怎麼回事
or what you think is going on.

443
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:10,910
若你真的想幫我
If you really wanna help,

444
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:13,160
就幫我找一台有語音功能的電腦
find me a computer with audio capabilities...

445
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,370
讓我解讀飛行記錄器
so I can access this flight recorder.

446
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,580
這裏沒有那種設備
We don't have anything like that here.

447
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:19,880
- 那主教呢  - 主教
- Well, what about Bishop? - Bishop?

448
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,460
跟我一起墜機的生化人
The droid that crashed with me.

449
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:24,920
我能告訴你在哪兒
I can point you in the right direction.

450
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,010
不能陪你去
I can't join you.

451
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:30,300
我已經有安排了
I have a previous engagement.

452
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:35,730
馬上加滿了 Golic 別亂動
This'll top you up. Golic, don't fidget.

453
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:40,690
怎麼會這樣 根本沒有包好
What's all this shit? It's not properly wrapped.

454
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,900
- 他有什麼事能做好的嗎  - 吃啊
- What the hell does he ever do right? - Eat.

455
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:45,320
- 腦滿肥腸  - Golic
- He's got that down pretty good. - Golic!

456
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,490
- 你給Murphy點蠟燭  - 我給他點1000支
- You light a candle for Murphy. - I'll light a thousand.

457
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:54,500
他以前很特別
He was special.

458
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:57,870
從沒抱怨過我
Never complained about me once.

459
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,000
我喜歡他
I loved him.

460
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,920
他們說的是真的嗎
Is it true what they say?

461
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:08,340
他頭被絞得稀巴爛
His head split into a million pieces?

462
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:11,180
好了 誰有火柴
Okay. Who's got the matches?

463
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:18,020
- 請坐 Clemens先生  - 謝謝
- Sit down, Mr. Clemens. - Thank you.

464
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,820
- 糖  - 不必了
- Sugar? - Uh, no thanks.

465
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,440
- 奶  - 一點點 謝謝
- Milk? - Just a little, please.

466
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,240
謝謝 Aaron先生
Thank you, Mr. Aaron.

467
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,250
聽著 你這坨屎
Listen to me, you piece of shit.

468
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:46,210
如果你再耍我 小心我把你劈開
You screw with me one more time, I'll cut you in half.

469
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:49,510
對不起 我不明白你的話
I'm sorry. I don't think l understand.

470
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:52,640
7點時 我通過網絡收到公司通知
At 0700 hours, l received word from the network.

471
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,560
以我所知 這是這款設備
I may point out this is the first high-level communication...

472
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:59,770
接收過的最高級別通信
this installation has ever received, to my knowledge.

473
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,730
他們要我們好好伺候這個女人
They want this woman looked after.

474
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,570
- 他們把她列為最高優先級  - 為什麼
- They consider her to be very high priority. - Why?

475
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:06,940
我也不知道
I have no idea.

476
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:10,320
你為何讓她離開醫療室
But why did you let her out of the infirmary?

477
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,570
Murphy的意外這類事故
This accident with Murphy is what happens...

478
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:13,630
還會發生
when one of these dumb

479
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,660
一旦哪個混蛋勃起時亂逛的話
sons of bitches walks around with a hard-on.

480
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,450
我是醫生 你才是獄卒
I'm a doctor. You're the jailer.

481
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:23,830
誰不知道你的身份啊
We both know exactly what you are.

482
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,090
- 坐下  - 我想我最好還是出去
- Sit down. - I think it might be better if I left.

483
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:30,880
我待在你身邊就不愉快
I find you... unpleasant to be around.

484
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:34,350
是嗎 這不好嗎 仔細想想 Clemens先生
You do? Isn't that lovely? Consider this, Mr. Clemens.

485
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:37,520
你覺得我把你的齷齪歷史
How would you like me to explain your sordid history...

486
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,850
告訴你的新朋友怎麼樣
to your newfound friend?

487
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,730
當然 是給她以啟迪
For her personal edification, of course.

488
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:46,440
給我馬上坐下
Now sit the hell down.

489
00:47:56,990 --> 00:48:00,160
我不喜歡你 你毫無規矩
I don't like you. You're unpredictable.

490
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:03,040
傲慢無禮 或許很危險
Insolent. Possibly dangerous.

491
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,000
你對什麼都懷疑
You question everything!

492
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:08,550
如果不是我需要醫務主管
If I didn't need a medical officer,

493
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:10,880
你在這兒根本待不了幾年
I wouldn't let you within light years of this operation.

494
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:14,180
- 我永遠感激  - 少說風涼話
- I'm eternally grateful. - Keep your sarcasms to yourself.

495
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:18,260
現在 有什麼要告訴我的嗎
Now, is there anything I should know?

496
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:22,100
- 想知道什麼  - 那個女人的事
- About what? - About the woman.

497
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,760
別玩我 Clemens
Don't play with me, Mr. Clemens.

498
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,730
你們基本每時每刻都在一起
You spend every second you can with her.

499
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:27,010
鬼才相信
And I have my suspicions

500
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,320
你這麼做全是為了治療
not all of your concerns with her are medical.

501
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,420
她跟你說過什麼
Has she said anything to you-

502
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,580
她從哪裏來 有什麼任務
anything about where she's from, what her mission is?

503
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,830
為什麼會在逃生艇內
What the hell she was doing in an E.E.V.?

504
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:43,710
她說他們戰隊遭遇不測
She told me she was part of a combat unit that came to grief.

505
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:46,290
其他的我想都是機密
Beyond that, I assume it's all classified.

506
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,710
我沒強求她說出來
I haven't pressed her for more.

507
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,800
- 就沒了  - 沒了
- That's all? - That's all.

508
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,970
- 你確定  - 確定
- You're sure? - Yes.

509
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:57,180
- 沒了 - 沒了
- Nothing more? - No.

510
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:02,890
滾出去
Get out of here.

511
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:54,040
閉嘴 他媽的騷貨
Shut up, you fuckin' bitch!

512
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:56,510
- 進去  - 閉嘴 騷婊子
- Get in there! - Shut up, you bitch!

513
00:50:56,590 --> 00:51:00,760
- 喊破喉嚨也沒人  - 混蛋 放手
- Nobody's gonna hear you. - Goddamn it, let go of me!

514
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,430
操 不
Fuck you! No!

515
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,560
別動 噓
Hold still! Shh! Shh!

516
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,390
不 見鬼
No! Goddamn it!

517
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,320
沒事吧
You okay?

518
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:22,620
你個王八蛋
No! Son of a bitch!

519
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:32,370
你走吧 我要教育教育這幾位兄弟
Take off. I gotta reeducate some of the brothers.

520
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:35,290
和他們談談精神問題
We've gotta discuss some matters of the spirit.

521
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:48,810
煙
Cigarettes!

522
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,740
我們走吧
So let's do it.

523
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:16,590
這裏有十街區這麼大
This is like 10 city blocks.

524
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:25,090
- 有多少  - 這是第176個
- How many? - This makes 176.

525
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:27,760
吃東西小聲點
Can't you chew a little quieter?

526
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:30,020
我正在算這區段有多大
I'm trying to figure out how big this compartment is.

527
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,890
你這麼吵我他媽無法思考
I can't think with all this goddamn noise you're making.

528
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:35,850
- 別說髒話  - 抱歉
- You're not supposed to swear. - I'm sorry.

529
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:40,360
- 我們已經走過一圈了  - 嘿
- Now, we've encircled this entire compartment once. - Hey.

530
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,900
什麼
What?

531
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:48,830
那他媽是怎麼回事
What the shit is doing that?

532
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:50,660
又罵 閉嘴
Swearing. Shut up.

533
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,250
我罵他媽的沒關係 又不是罵上帝
It's all right to say "Shit." It ain't against God.

534
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:55,710
蠟燭怎麼就滅了
What the hell is going on with the candles?

535
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:03,010
一定是附近通風孔
Must be the wind from one of the vent shafts.

536
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:05,880
吹來的逆風
Backwash from the closest circulating unit.

537
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:07,260
要是蠟燭都被吹熄
But if all the candles go out,

538
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,970
我們怎麼知道自己的位置
how the hell we gonna know where we are?

539
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,350
只好派人回去 重新點亮
Somebody will just have to go back and relight them.

540
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:15,230
我看我去吧
I guess I'm nominated.

541
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,570
當心點 兄弟
Watch your step, brother.

542
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:40,460
好了 誰在開玩笑
Okay, who are the comedians?

543
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:28,430
等等 等等
Wait, wait, wait!

544
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:30,680
- 快 往這走  - 救命
- Quick, grab it. Here. - Help me! Help me!

545
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:35,520
快 他媽快走
Go! Fuckin' go!

546
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,900
走 快點
Go, go, go! Quick! Run!

547
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,120
拿來
Gimme that!

548
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:34,450
把這雞巴玩意兒拿開
Get this fucking thing off me!

549
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:36,740
哦 操
Oh, fuck!

550
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:38,790
放開我
Let me go!

551
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:38,890
嘿
Hey.

552
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:42,480
啊 Ripley
Ah, Ripley.

553
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:46,190
主教 你好 感覺怎麼樣
Hi, Bishop. How you feeling?

554
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:48,230
腿疼
My legs hurt.

555
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,530
聽著 很抱歉
Uh, listen, I'm sorry.

556
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:53,200
沒事 我只是個至尊版的烤麵包機
It's okay. I'm just a glorified toaster.

557
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,280
你好嗎
How are you?

558
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,910
我喜歡你的新髮型
I like your new haircut.

559
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:01,250
主教 你能查飛行記錄嗎
Bishop, can you access data on the flight recorder?

560
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:02,000
沒問題
No problem.

561
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:31,320
Golic
Golic?

562
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:39,320
- 好了  - Sulaco號發生了什麼事
- I'm home. - What happened on the Sulaco?

563
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:42,040
低溫艙為何彈射出來
Why were our cryo-tubes ejected?

564
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,660
靜態平衡受干擾
Stasis interrupted.

565
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:48,630
低溫艙起火
Fire in cryogenic compartment.

566
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:52,210
- 重覆 低溫艙  - 發生了什麼
- Repeat. Fire in cryogenic... - What happened?

567
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,840
是什麼起火了 主教
What started the fire, Bishop?

568
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,930
能聽到我嗎
Can you hear me?

569
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:00,220
電路起火
The fire was electrical.

570
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,560
就在地板下面
It was in the subflooring.

571
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,000
脫離母艦前
Did the sensors pick up anything

572
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,230
傳感器有檢測到什麼東西在艦上嗎
moving around on the ship prior to separation?

573
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:10,770
這兒好暗 Ripley 我的視力大不如前
It's very dark here, Ripley. I'm not what I used to be.

574
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:15,240
告訴我 記錄儀有什麼顯示
Just tell me. Does the recorder indicate anything?

575
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,780
船上有異形嗎
Was there an alien on board?

576
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,070
有的
Yes.

577
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:28,540
它還在蘇拉可號 還是和我們一起墜機
Is it on the Sulaco or did it come with us on the E.E.V.?

578
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:31,920
它一直都和我們一起
It was with us all the way.

579
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,230
公司知道嗎
Does the company know?

580
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:53,520
公司知道艦上的所有事
The company knows everything that happened on the ship.

581
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:57,990
一切都輸入電腦 傳回總公司
It all goes into the computer and gets sent back to network.

582
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:00,030
他們還是要異形
And they want it.

583
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:05,410
痛啊 幫個忙 切斷電源
I hurt. Do me a favor. Disconnect me.

584
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:09,580
即使修好 也回不到以前了
I could be reworked, but I'll never be top of the line again.

585
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:12,330
我寧願變廢物
I'd rather be nothing.

586
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,920
你確定嗎
You're sure?

587
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:19,300
就當為我好 Ripley
Do it for me, Ripley.

588
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:37,320
不是我 不是我幹的
It wasn't me! I didn't do it!

589
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,530
那是 那是一條龍
It was— It was the dragon.

590
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:43,780
它吃人的腦袋
Feeds on minds. It was—

591
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:46,240
- 無法阻擋  - Boggs和Rains呢
- Nobody can stop it. - What about Boggs and Rains?

592
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:48,660
他們全像豬一樣被宰啦 不是我幹的
They got s-slaughtered like pigs. It wasn't me!

593
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:53,500
- 不是我  - 明顯整個一瘋子
- It wasn't me! - Stark raving mad.

594
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:54,960
我沒說這是誰的錯
I'm not saying it was anyone's fault,

595
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,250
但該把他鎖起來
but he should have been chained up.

596
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:59,670
說得是 他媽真瘋了
You called it, sir. Mad as a fucking hatter.

597
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,650
把他隔離
Keep him separated from the rest.

598
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:03,550
別引起恐慌
I don't want him causing a panic.

599
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,800
Clemens 讓這白癡鎮靜下來
Clemens, sedate this poor idiot.

600
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:08,310
我們得先弄清楚兄弟的下落
Not until we know about the brothers.

601
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:12,230
冷靜一點 告訴我
Now, now. Pull yourself together. Talk to me now.

602
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:15,230
- Boggs和Rains在哪裏  - 不是我幹的
- Now, where are Boggs and Rains? - It wasn't me!

603
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:17,190
沒用的 問不出來什麼
Hopeless. You're not gonna get anything out of him.

604
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:20,150
- 不是我  - 我們要派出一支搜尋隊
- It wasn't me. - We'll have to send out a search team.

605
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,570
恐怕我們得做好他們全被
I'm afraid we'll have to assume there's a very good chance...

606
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,990
這個畜生殺了的打算
this simple bastard has murdered them.

607
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:29,240
這你並不清楚
Now, you don't know that.

608
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:33,000
他從不騙我
He's never lied to me.

609
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:36,330
他瘋瘋癲癲 他是傻子 但是他不騙我
He's crazy, he's a fool, but he's not a liar.

610
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:40,710
他說的是真的
He's telling the truth.

611
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,930
我想跟他談談這條龍
I'd like to talk to him about this— this dragon.

612
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:46,970
- 就是一條龍  - 中尉 你不能跟人交談
- It was a dragon. - You're not talking to anyone, Lieutenant.

613
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:49,930
我不想聽你的觀點
I'm not interested in your opinion,

614
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:52,140
因為你根本沒搞清楚狀況
because you are not in full possession of the facts.

615
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:54,110
這個人是連環殺手
This man is a convicted multiple murderer,

616
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:55,770
手段極其殘忍
known for particularly brutal crimes.

617
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,520
對嗎 Dillon先生
Isn't that right, Mr. Dillon?

618
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:01,400
對 這倒沒錯
Yeah. That part's right.

619
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:06,320
那我跟你說 很重要
Then I'll talk to you. It's important.

620
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:08,830
我完成職務後
When I have finished with my official duties,

621
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:12,040
很樂意和你談 行嗎
I will be quite pleased to have a little chat, yes?

622
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:19,260
讓我先弄清楚 中尉
Let me see if I have this correct, Lieutenant.

623
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:21,800
這怪物有8英尺高
It's an eight-foot creature of some kind,

624
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:26,130
血液是強酸 坐你的太空船到達此地
with acid for blood, and it arrived on your spaceship.

625
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:29,720
它見人就殺 性情不太友善
It kills on sight and is generally unpleasant.

626
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:32,350
當然 你期望我相信你的這些話
And, of course, you expect me to accept all this on your word.

627
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:34,810
不 我什麼都不期望
No, I don't expect anything.

628
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:39,730
- 故事很精彩 Aaron先生 - 對 很精彩
- Quite a story, Mr. Aaron. - Right, sir. It's a beauty.

629
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:42,780
- 從沒聽說過這種事  - 可不是嗎
- Never heard anything quite like it, sir. - Expect not.

630
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:44,950
告訴我 中尉 你建議我們怎麼做
Tell me, Lieutenant, what would you suggest we do?

631
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,740
你們有哪些武器
Well, what kind of weapons have you got?

632
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:51,830
這是監獄
This is a prison.

633
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:54,370
不能讓囚犯碰武器
It's not a good idea to allow prisoners access to firearms.

634
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:56,250
那他們怎麼不殺了你
What keeps them from killing you?

635
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:59,290
恐懼 也根本逃不出去
Fear. There's no way to escape.

636
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:01,570
下一班補給船到達時
With the arrival of the next supply ship,

637
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:03,340
公司會派人消滅他們
the company would eliminate them.

638
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:07,300
這是最高安全級別的監獄
This is a maximum security prison,

639
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:12,510
你們卻什麼武器都沒有
and you have no weapons of any kind?

640
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:17,130
屠宰場有幾把菜刀
We have some carving knives in the abattoir.

641
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:18,600
飯堂也有
A few more in the mess hall.

642
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:20,720
還有一些分散的消防斧
Some fire axes scattered about the place.

643
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,110
沒有大威力殺傷武器
Nothing terribly formidable.

644
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:23,480
就沒了
That's all?

645
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:25,320
我們實施榮譽機制
We're on the honor system.

646
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:35,540
- 我們死定了  - 不 你死定了
- Then we're fucked. - No, you're fucked.

647
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:39,000
你將監禁在醫療室 隔離起來
Confined to the infirmary. Quarantined.

648
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,790
Aaron先生會護送你去
Mr. Aaron will escort you.

649
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,020
你在那兒最安全
I think you'll be safe from any large,

650
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:46,170
遠離野獸 不是嗎
nasty beast while you're there, right?

651
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:51,340
對 這才乖
Yes, that's a good girl.

652
01:02:54,350 --> 01:02:58,020
全體到飯堂報道
Let's all report to the mess hall.

653
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:00,360
獄長Andrews召開會議
Superintendent Andrews wants a meeting.

654
01:03:00,370 --> 01:03:02,110
各位 馬上來飯堂
Mess hall, right away, people.

655
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:06,280
有沒有逃離辦法 從這兒出去
Isn't there any way off of this place? Some way to escape?

656
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:10,110
沒 補給船每隔6個月才來
No. Supply ship comes every six months.

657
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,200
- 只有這樣  - 沒錯
- And that's it? - Mm-hmm.

658
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:15,120
可惡
Fuck.

659
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:19,460
很快就會有人來接你 據我所知
They are sending somebody to pick you up quite soon, I gather.

660
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:22,330
真的 很快是多快
Really. What's "Soon"?

661
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:27,090
不知道 以前沒有人急著來這裏
I don't know. Nobody's ever been in a hurry to get here before.

662
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,680
你願意說說 安德魯和你談了些什麼嗎
Do you want to tell me what you and Andrews talked about?

663
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,010
不
No.

664
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:39,140
你會認為我瘋了
You'll just say I'm crazy.

665
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:45,190
那有點太過分了
That's a bit uncharitable.

666
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,320
感覺怎麼樣
How are you feeIing?

667
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,530
不太好
Not so hot.

668
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:56,530
喉嚨痛
Sore throat.

669
01:03:56,620 --> 01:04:00,540
胃不舒服 而且還有慪氣
Sick to my stomach. Pissed off.

670
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:04,500
在這種情況下我能理解
Well, that's understandable given the circumstances.

671
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:08,050
也許我 該給你打一劑特別的藥
Perhaps I should give you one of my special cocktails.

672
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:10,970
為什麼大家都喜歡互相指責
I don't know why everybody blames everybody for everything.

673
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:13,470
沒人是完美的 都是人啊
Nobody's perfect, only human.

674
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,970
世間不存在完人
There's no such thing as a perfect human.

675
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:21,140
在荒唐的世界裏
In an insane world,

676
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:23,690
一個正常人
a sane man...

677
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:28,230
必須 表現得 不正常
must... appear... insane.

678
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:31,900
很有深度 Golic 謝謝
That's very profound, Golic. Thank you.

679
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:40,540
結婚了嗎
You married?

680
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:43,210
- 我  - 你早該結婚了 生幾個孩子
- Me? - You should get married, have kids.

681
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:48,500
你這麼漂亮 我以前認識很多漂亮女孩
Pretty girl. I used to know lots of 'em back home.

682
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:51,460
她們都喜歡我
They used to like me.

683
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:55,930
很快就變心了
For a while.

684
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,930
你也會死的
You're gonna die too.

685
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:14,700
- 你有沒有  - 什麼
- Are you? - What?

686
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:17,030
結婚啊
Married.

687
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,530
怎麼了
Why?

688
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:22,870
- 好奇罷了  - 沒
- Just curious. - No.

689
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:31,050
- 你不跟我坦白嗎  - 坦白什麼
- How about leveling with me? - Could you be more specific?

690
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:34,760
我問你怎麼派到這兒來了 你沒回答
When I asked how you got assigned here, you avoided the question.

691
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,630
然後問你的監獄條形碼
And then when l asked about the prison I.D.

692
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,050
紋在你後腦勺的那個
Tattooed on the back of your head,

693
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:40,010
你又閃爍其詞
you ducked me again.

694
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:45,190
說來話長 令人傷心
It's a long, sad story...

695
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,730
不是一般的戲劇性
and more than a little melodramatic.

696
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:51,190
說來聽聽
Try me.

697
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:55,700
如你所願
If you insist.

698
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:02,740
學生時代結束以後
After my student years,

699
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:06,830
雖然我已經
despite the fact that I had become...

700
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,330
偷偷對嗎啡上癮
secretly addicted to morphine,

701
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:11,670
我仍被當做最有希望
I was considered to be most promising,

702
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:14,210
最具前程的男人
a man with a future.

703
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:21,510
我第一次住院實習時 我在急診室加班了36個小時
And during my first residency, I did a 36-hour stretch on an E.R.

704
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:26,310
所以出來後 我喝得酩酊大醉
So, I went out and I got more than a little drunk.

705
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:28,560
接著又被召回醫院
Then I got called back.

706
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:30,810
因為燃料廠的蒸汽爐爆炸
Boiler had blown on a fuel plant,

707
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,980
30名傷患
and there were 30 casualties.

708
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:36,400
其中11個死了
And 11 of them died.

709
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:38,660
倒不是因為意外
Not as a result of the accident...

710
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:41,200
而是因為我止痛藥計量用錯了
but because I prescribed the wrong dosage of painkiller.

711
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:47,330
我被判7年 執照降為3C
I got seven years in prison and my license reduced to a 3-C.

712
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:52,630
至少我擺脫嗎啡了
At least I got off the morphine.

713
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:54,880
抱歉
I'm sorry.

714
01:06:56,630 --> 01:06:58,800
我覺得自己判輕了
I think I was let off lightly.

715
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,800
你在這兒服刑嗎
Did you serve your time here?

716
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:06,890
我和這群烏合之眾很熟
I got to know this motley crew quite well.

717
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:10,850
所以他們不願意走時 我也留了下來
So when they stayed, I stayed.

718
01:07:12,270 --> 01:07:14,610
沒別的人願意雇我
Nobody eIse would employ me.

719
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:21,780
你還相信手裏有針的我嗎
So, do you still trust me with a needle?

720
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:53,370
太壯觀了
Magnificent.

721
01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:00,420
主啊 給我們力量來堅守
Give us strength, O Lord, to endure.

722
01:09:00,510 --> 01:09:02,160
我們只是上帝手中
We recognize that we are

723
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:05,050
卑微的罪人
poor sinners in the hands of an angry God.

724
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:09,470
但願循環不被破壞 直到末日降臨
Let the circle be unbroken until the day. Amen.

725
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,060
- 阿門  - 這裏他媽怎麼回事
- Amen. - What the fuck is happening here?

726
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:17,900
怎麼他媽能出這麼多鬼事
What the fuck is this bullshit that's comin' down?

727
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:20,980
有人死了 有人強暴 有兄弟身陷困境
We got murder. We got rape. We got brothers in trouble.

728
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:25,450
我不想看到再發生什麼鬼事了
I don't want no more bullshit around here!

729
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:30,240
有問題 我們一起面對
Now, we got problems, we stand together.

730
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:33,160
謝謝 Dillon先生 好了
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Dillon. All right.

731
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:36,370
再一次 下面開始闢謠
Once again, this is rumor control.

732
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:39,000
情況如下
Here are the facts.

733
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:41,750
8時 囚犯Murphy
At 0800 hours, prisoner Murphy,

734
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:44,670
由於一時疏忽
through carelessness on his part,

735
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,590
在17號通風孔喪生
was found dead in vent shaft 17.

736
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:50,220
他似乎是被吸到通風風扇的
He seems to have been sucked into a ventilator fan.

737
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:56,440
大約21時
At about 2100 hours,

738
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:00,650
囚犯Golic又一次精神錯亂
prisoner Golic reappeared in a deranged state.

739
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:03,030
囚犯Boggs和Rains失蹤
Prisoners Boggs and Rains are missing.

740
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:04,780
他們倆很可能
There seems to be a good

741
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:07,780
已經遇害身亡
chance that they have met with foul play...

742
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:11,120
嫌犯為Golic
at the hands of prisoner Golic.

743
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,910
我們要組織一個搜救分隊
We need to organize and send out a search party.

744
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:20,630
歡迎各位踴躍報名
Volunteers will be appreciated.

745
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:27,380
這座監獄一直相安無事
I think it's fair to say that our smoothly running facility...

746
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:30,300
現在突然出現了一些問題
has suddenly developed a few problems.

747
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:32,560
只能希望我們
I can only hope we are able

748
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:36,270
接下來能振作起來
to all pull together over the next few days...

749
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:39,560
一起等待Ripley中尉的救援隊到來
until the rescue team arrives for Lieutenant Ripley.

750
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:41,610
它來了 它抓走了Clemens
It's here! It got Clemens!

751
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:43,230
別在這胡言亂語
Stop this raving at once! Stop it!

752
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:45,400
我跟你說它來了
I'm telling you, it's here!

753
01:10:45,490 --> 01:10:48,400
Aaron 把這個瘋女人鎖到醫務室去
Aaron, get that foolish woman back to the infirmary!

754
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:53,660
快跑
Move it!

755
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,330
讓開
Out of my way!

756
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:01,960
操
Fuck!

757
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:11,760
主啊 我們感謝你
We give you thanks, O Lord.

758
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:16,850
您的憤怒已顯示 我們知道審判將至
Your wrath has come, and the time is near for us to be judged.

759
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:21,900
世界末日馬上來了
The apocalypse is upon us.

760
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:27,610
希望我們能準備好 希望您公正
Let us be ready. Let your mercy be just.

761
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:29,320
- 它太大了  - 阿門
- It was massive. - Amen!

762
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:31,990
- 還很敏捷  - 我知道 我看到了
- And fast. - I was there. I saw it.

763
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:36,410
現在他媽該怎麼辦 誰來管事
What the fuck do we do now? Who's in fucking charge?

764
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:42,920
我們得組織起來 對吧
Organize. We gotta organize, right?

765
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,710
對 我想我就是候補人員了
Right. Well, I guess I'm next in line.

766
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,460
讓85管事 天吶
85's gonna be in charge. Jesus,

767
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:49,380
- 別逗了  - 別這麼叫我
- give us a break! - Don't call me that.

768
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:51,840
聽著 我不能替代Andrews
Okay, look. There's no way I can replace Andrews.

769
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:54,640
他是個好人 我知道你們不喜歡他
He was a good man. I know you guys didn't appreciate him.

770
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,890
Aaron 我們現在不想聽屁話
Aaron, we don't want to hear that shit now.

771
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:01,020
你呢 妹子 你是個軍官
Hey, sister, what about you? You're an officer.

772
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:03,020
給我們展示一點領導才能吧
How about showing us a little leadership?

773
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:05,060
別管她 你管事吧
Forget fucking Shirley Temple. You take charge.

774
01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:07,400
- 對  - 反正現在也是你負責
- Right. - You run things here anyway.

775
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:12,490
不可能 我不是當官的料
No fuckin' way. I'm not the officer type.

776
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:15,740
我只能管好自己
I just take care of my own.

777
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:19,040
這臭怪物想要什麼
Well, what does this fucking beast want?

778
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,080
這個老娘到底願不願意指揮
Is this mother gonna try for us all?

779
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:29,050
- 好吧  - 這太好了
- Yeah. - Well, ain't that sweet?

780
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:31,920
我們怎麼阻止它
So how are we gonna stop it?

781
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:38,260
- 我們沒有武器 是吧  - 對
- We have no weapons. Is that correct? - Right.

782
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:42,060
我看到過的和這只有點不一樣
I haven't seen one exactly like this before.

783
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:44,600
移動方式不一樣
Moves differently.

784
01:12:46,690 --> 01:12:49,190
但其他的都怕火
But the others were afraid of fire—

785
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,280
別的就不怕了
not much else.

786
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:55,740
- 我們能封鎖這地方嗎  - 不可能
- Can we seal off this area? - No chance.

787
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:57,990
這監獄10平方英里
The installation's 10 miles square.

788
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:00,370
- 有600個通風管道  - 監控呢
- There's 600 air ducts running to the surface. - What about video?

789
01:13:00,450 --> 01:13:02,630
我看到處都有閉路監控
I see these closed-circuit monitors everywhere.

790
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,170
我們能通過這個找到它
We could try to find it that way.

791
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:08,380
監控壞了很多年了 這裏的東西全是壞的
The video system hasn't worked in years. Nothing much works here.

792
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:10,670
很多高科技設備 全用不了
We got a lot of technology, no way to fix it.

793
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:13,170
- 85想說的是  - 別這麼叫我
- What 85 is trying to tell you is... - Don't call me that!

794
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:16,340
我們沒有娛樂中心 沒有氣候控制
we ain't got no entertainment center, no climate control,

795
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:19,010
沒有視頻系統 沒有監控
no video system, no surveillance,

796
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:22,600
沒冰箱 他媽連冰淇淋都沒有
no freezers, no fucking ice cream,

797
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:25,480
沒避孕套 沒女人 沒槍
no rubbers, no women, no guns.

798
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,650
只有他媽一堆屎
All we got here is shit!

799
01:13:27,730 --> 01:13:30,440
跟她說這些有個屁用
Oh, what the hell are we even talking to her for?

800
01:13:30,530 --> 01:13:33,950
那雞巴玩意兒可是她帶過來的
She's the one that brought the fucker.

801
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:35,450
為什麼我們不抓著她的頭
Why don't we just get her

802
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:37,910
塞進那雞巴牆壁裏呢
head and shove it through the fucking wall?

803
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:40,240
聽起來不錯哦
That sounds good to me.

804
01:13:40,330 --> 01:13:42,330
嘿 Morse
Hey, Morse.

805
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:48,380
閉上你的鳥嘴
Why don't you shut the fuck up?

806
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:56,340
沒錯
Right.

807
01:13:57,340 --> 01:14:00,390
沒錯 我們該怎麼做
Right. What are we going to do?

808
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:17,280
這是哪裏
What's this? Um,

809
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:20,450
這從飯堂通到醫療室
that leads from the mess hall to the infirmary.

810
01:14:20,530 --> 01:14:22,540
是通風口
It's a ventilation shaft.

811
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:25,960
我們從這裏進去 把它逼出來
Then we go in there, flush it out.

812
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:30,040
嘿 這隧道有好幾英里長呢
Hey. Hey, look, there's miles and miles of tunnel through there.

813
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,050
它不會走遠的
It won't go far.

814
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:36,380
它肯定就在這片築巢
It'll nest in this area.

815
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:38,470
就在這附近
Right around here.

816
01:14:39,470 --> 01:14:42,970
你怎麼知道
How do you know that?

817
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:46,770
它就像獅子
It's like a lion.

818
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:49,060
緊跟著斑馬
It sticks close to the zebras.

819
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:51,560
斑馬 哦對
Zebras? Oh, right.

820
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:54,320
這麼暗跑來跑去 你開玩笑嗎
But, look. Running around down here in the dark, are you kidding?

821
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,780
出了主通風孔就沒電燈的
Once you get out of this main shaft, there's no overheads.

822
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,100
不是有手電筒嗎
Don't we have flashlights?

823
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:00,030
是有上千個 但沒電池啊
We got thousands of 'em, but no batteries.

824
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,950
- 我說了 都壞了  - 火把呢
- I told you, nothing works. - Torches?

825
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:06,040
我們能生火吧
Do we have the capacity to make fire?

826
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:09,420
人類從石器時代起就有這能力
Most humans have enjoyed that privilege since the Stone Age.

827
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,750
沒必要這麼帶刺
No need to be sarcastic.

828
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,000
從沒用過 他們本來
Never been used. They were

829
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,420
打算扔一些廢棄核原料
gonna dump a lot of nuclear crap in there.

830
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:21,640
一直沒空 裏面空無一物
Never got around to it. It's clean as a whistle inside.

831
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,180
只有這一個進出口
This the only way in or out?

832
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:28,020
是的 牆壁6尺多厚 實心鋼造的
That's right. Walls are six feet thick, solid steel.

833
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:30,520
建造得真是到位
Really knew how to build these babies.

834
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,520
你是說我們把異形關裏面
You're saying we get something in there,

835
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:36,070
它就不可能出得來了
there's no way it can get out?

836
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:39,400
對 絕不可能
That's right. No fucking way.

837
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:48,750
原來放這兒了 這東西叫啥來著
This is where we keep it. I forget what the stuff's called.

838
01:15:48,830 --> 01:15:52,330
- 圭乃特利西特林  - 我知道
- Quinitricetyline. - I knew that.

839
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:53,660
好吧 我得和Dillon一起
Right. I've got to get these

840
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:58,380
把這髹漆的工作分配好
section arrangements organized with Dillon for the paintbrush.

841
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:00,840
- 那麼 呃  - David
- So, um. - David.

842
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:05,010
- 是的 你把這些油桶準備好  - 好的 85
- Yeah. You can get these drums organized. - Right, 85.

843
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:08,470
還有 別這麼叫我
And, uh, don't call me that.

844
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:14,900
85是什麼意思
What's this "85" Thing?

845
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:16,050
他剛來的時候
Couple of us sneaked a

846
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:18,280
我們有人偷看了他的檔案
look at his personnel file the day he arrived.

847
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:20,360
這是他智商
It's his I.Q.

848
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:29,620
我以前看到過這個
I saw a drum of this stuff...

849
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:31,870
掉在灘頭的碉堡
fall into a beachhead bunker once.

850
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:35,420
炸得碼頭三個多月沒有魚群
The blast put a tug in dry dock for 17 weeks.

851
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:36,290
好東西啊
Great stuff!

852
01:16:42,050 --> 01:16:45,090
讓我搞清楚
All right. Let me get this straight.

853
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:48,600
你想用火逼它出通風管
You want to burn it down and out of the pipes,

854
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,850
逃到這兒 把門鎖上
force it in here, slam the door...

855
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:53,560
- 然後把它困住  - 對
- and trap its ass? - Right.

856
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:57,480
你要我們 這些天生罪犯幫忙
And you want help from us y-chromo boys, huh?

857
01:16:57,570 --> 01:16:59,440
你們還有其他好主意嗎
You got something better to do?

858
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:02,320
為什麼我們要冒險替你拚命呢
Why should we put our ass on the line for you?

859
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,570
你們已經命懸一線了
Your ass is already on the line.

860
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:06,280
唯一的問題就是
The only question is...

861
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:08,780
你們該怎麼最後一搏
what are you gonna do about it?

862
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:23,590
你看看
Look at this.

863
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:26,140
兩千個電池 只有一個能用
There's only one of these fucking batteries in 2,000 that works.

864
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:28,470
還不算最糟嘛
Hey, it could have been a lot worse.

865
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:33,100
油刷說不定還不能用呢
We might have got the paintbrush detail.

866
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:38,860
天 這玩意兒太臭了
Man, this stuff stinks.

867
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:56,330
- 這玩意臭死人了  - 那就別他媽吸氣
- This shit smells awful. - Then don't breathe the fucking fumes.

868
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:59,380
我他媽就在這個管子裏 你讓我怎麼不吸氣
I'm in a fucking pipe with it. How can I keep from breathing it!

869
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:02,710
不要深呼吸嘛
I mean, don't breathe too hard.

870
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:06,260
- 你會吸嗨的  - 那敢情好
- You'll get high. - That's good for me.

871
01:18:14,770 --> 01:18:17,020
你想念醫生 是吧
So you miss Doc, right?

872
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:22,230
憑什麼這麼說呢
What makes you say that?

873
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,650
我猜你們親近過了
I thought you two got real close.

874
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:30,160
我猜你很喜歡偷窺
l guess you've been looking through some keyholes.

875
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:34,910
我就說
That's what l thought.

876
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:43,130
- 你還好嗎  - 沒事
- You okay? - Yeah. I'm fine.

877
01:18:43,210 --> 01:18:47,800
隨你怎麼說 我看你可沒那麼好 姐妹
Whatever you say, but, uh, you don't look okay to me, sister.

878
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:51,470
真沒事
I'm fine.

879
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:57,480
我恨這地方 我恨這地方
I hate this place. I hate this place.

880
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:05,650
很明顯這裏有個什麼東西
There's definitely something in here with us.

881
01:19:07,950 --> 01:19:10,740
我沒給信號 不許點火
Okay. Don't light the fire until I give the signal.

882
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:13,410
信號是這樣
This is the signal.

883
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:16,830
知道了嗎 記得住吧
Got it? Can you remember that?

884
01:19:21,210 --> 01:19:23,000
該死
Shit!

885
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:25,860
他媽的怎麼不等信號
Wait for the fucking signaI!

886
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:36,120
趴下
Get down!

887
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:43,290
快點 我們得找到灑水器
Come on, come on! We gotta find the sprinklers!

888
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,540
快 我們得救救他們
Come on! We gotta help these guys!

889
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:56,100
快 來 來
Come on! Move! Move!

890
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:00,310
去廢料處理場 別開門
Go to the waste dump. Don't open the doors!

891
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:05,040
- 天啊  - 沒事的
- Oh, God! - It's all right.

892
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:08,500
沒事 你會沒事的 有我們在
It's all right. You're gonna be all right. We got you.

893
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:12,670
火滅了
Fire's out.

894
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:25,140
Junior Junior 去灑水器那兒 把它打開
Junior! Junior! Get those sprinklers and turn them on.

895
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:28,690
我們帶他出去
We gotta get him out of here.

896
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:37,700
來 我們帶你出去
Come on. We're walking you out.

897
01:22:44,910 --> 01:22:48,210
Junior 你後面
Junior! Behind you!

898
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:52,000
開門啊
Open the door!

899
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:55,380
來 來
Come on! Come on!

900
01:23:03,010 --> 01:23:05,890
來啊 來
Come on! Come on!

901
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,520
來抓我啊 畜生
Come and get me, fucker!

902
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:44,490
即使是對那些逝去的人們
Even for those who have fallen,

903
01:24:44,570 --> 01:24:48,410
現在也是慶祝的時刻
this is a time of rejoicing.

904
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:54,040
向他們的勇氣致敬
We salute their courage.

905
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:57,790
他們永垂不朽
They will live forever.

906
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:04,720
死亡並不是結束
Those that are dead are not dead.

907
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,600
他們啟程了
They have moved up.

908
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:11,350
他們升至天國
They have moved to a higher place.

909
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:14,140
瘋子
Crazy bastards.

910
01:25:14,230 --> 01:25:16,660
Andrews稱他們為Dillon的神兵
Andrews used to call them Dillon's God Squad.

911
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:18,070
庇護他們免受傷害
Keeps 'em out of mischief.

912
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:22,610
- 你不信教嗎  - 我
- You're not the religious type. - Me?

913
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:25,360
鬼才信 我有正當工作
Shit, no. I've got a job.

914
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:28,990
聽著
Look, uh-

915
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:32,040
救援隊應該四五天後就到了
Figure the rescue team gets here in four, five days—

916
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:34,250
最多6天
six, tops.

917
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:39,340
他們一開門 拿出機關鎗轟死它
They open the door, go in there with smart guns and kill it.

918
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:45,720
- 有收到他們消息嗎  - 沒有
- What have you heard from them? - Nothing much.

919
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,300
只說收到訊息
We got a message received.

920
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:51,350
後來 又說你是最高優先級別
Later, we got something that said you were top priority.

921
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:55,350
他們沒給機會讓我們問話
They don't cut us in on much.

922
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:58,650
我們他媽是圖騰柱的最末端
We're the ass end of the totem pole out here.

923
01:25:58,730 --> 01:26:00,940
要是他們不想殺怪物呢
What if they don't want to kill it?

924
01:26:03,070 --> 01:26:06,200
- 帶回去嗎  - 對
- Take it back? - Yeah.

925
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:10,530
他們又不是瘋子 一定得殺了它
They're not lunatics, you know? Gotta kill it.

926
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:12,740
對吧
Right?

927
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:22,550
Morse 拜託 鬆開我
Morse, please, cut me loose.

928
01:26:22,630 --> 01:26:24,380
不可能
No fucking way.

929
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:26,130
來啊 很痛的
Come on, man. It hurts.

930
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:28,220
對不起了
Oh, sorry.

931
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:31,470
求求你了 我什麼都沒做啊
Come on. I haven't done nothing.

932
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:36,140
- 別吵我  - 求你了 我做了什麼
- Just don't talk to me. - Please, what did I do? Please.

933
01:26:36,230 --> 01:26:37,830
告訴你我會怎麼做
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

934
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:40,770
我就坐在這兒靜靜地看著你這個傻逼
I'm gonna sit here and guard your ass like I'm supposed to.

935
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:43,480
我他媽可不想Dillon怪我
I don't need any fucking trouble with Dillon.

936
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:45,730
我就是告訴他們
All I did was tell 'em about the dragon,

937
01:26:45,730 --> 01:26:47,400
那條龍殺了Boggs和Rains
what it did to Boggs and Rains.

938
01:26:47,490 --> 01:26:51,120
你也看到了 我沒瞎說
I didn't lie. You saw it.

939
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,080
操 我看到了
Fuckin' "A" I saw it.

940
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:55,580
拜託
Oh, please.

941
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:58,670
它一進來我就死定了 我跑不了啊
If this gets in here, I'm dead. I can't run.

942
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:00,790
它進不來的 它被關起來了
It's not going to get in here. We got it trapped.

943
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:07,590
沒事的 來啊 鬆綁啊 兄弟
So what's the big deal? Come on. Let me loose, man.

944
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:14,180
- 我每次都先給你煙  - 對
- Don't I always give you cigarettes first? - Yeah.

945
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:17,270
我不是你朋友嗎
Aren't I your friend?

罷了罷了
Why not?

948
01:27:30,820 --> 01:27:33,330
規矩點 別亂跑
But behave yourself. No fucking around...

949
01:27:33,410 --> 01:27:35,870
不然我就死定了
or I'll get nothing but shit.

950
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:47,510
- 怪物在哪兒  - 廢料室
- So where they got it? - In the waste tank.

951
01:27:47,630 --> 01:27:52,300
我們把它牢牢釘住了 不 關住了
We got that sucker nailed. I mean, tight.

952
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:54,930
我想再看看
Gotta see it again.

953
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:56,890
你瞎雞巴說什麼
What the fuck you talking about?

954
01:27:59,890 --> 01:28:02,770
不給你煙了
No more cigarettes for you.

955
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:14,570
第一步完成了 你要說什麼
Right. We got the first part. Now what do we say?

956
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:18,040
說我們困住它了
Tell them we trapped it.

957
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:22,290
- 它叫什麼  - 異形怪物
- What do we call it? - A xenomorph.

958
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:24,380
對
Right.

959
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:28,460
怎麼拼的
How do you spell it?

960
01:28:45,610 --> 01:28:47,230
等等 我們殺不掉啊
Hey, wait a minute. We can't kill it.

961
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,030
- 我們又沒有武器 不是嗎  - 沒錯
- We don't have any weapons, right? - Right.

962
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:57,240
看 這就是回答 屁都沒有
See? That's all they ever tell us. Treat us like shit.

963
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:26,560
- 時好時壞  - 你他媽說啥
- Off and on me now? - What the hell you talking about?

964
01:29:26,650 --> 01:29:29,230
告訴我那怪獸的事
Talk to me, the beast.

965
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:31,710
你不能進去 傻逼
You can't go in there, dickhead.

966
01:29:31,710 --> 01:29:34,700
那個怪物會吃掉你這傻逼的
The big motherfucker will eat you alive.

967
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,670
抱歉
Sorry.

968
01:29:46,750 --> 01:29:49,790
對不起 對不起 對不起 對不起
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

969
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:17,030
告訴我接下來怎麼做
Tell me what to do next.

970
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:48,980
你是說 他們要活捉這個怪物
So, you're telling me they're coming to take this thing away?

971
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:52,360
是 他們會想盡辦法 他們不會殺它的
Yeah, they're gonna try. They don't wanna kill it.

972
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:54,940
我們得在他們來之前殺了它
We gotta figure out a way to do it before they come here.

973
01:30:55,030 --> 01:30:56,570
為什麼需要我們來殺它
Why do we have to kill it?

974
01:30:56,570 --> 01:30:59,070
你說公司會過來處理的
You just said the company's coming for it.

975
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:02,200
是 他們要把它帶回去
That's right. They wanna take it back.

976
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:05,080
- 用作研究武器  - 這有何不妥嗎
- Some sort of weapon. - Yeah, what's wrong with that?

977
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:05,950
他們操控不了它
They can't control it.

978
01:31:05,950 --> 01:31:07,500
他們不理解危險性 它會大肆殺戮的
They don't understand. It'll kill them all.

979
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:10,670
我說了 有什麼不妥嗎
Like I said, what's wrong with that?

980
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:12,510
沒什麼不妥
Nothing's wrong with that...

981
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:15,090
只是很多無辜的人會死而已
except a lot of innocent people will die.

982
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:21,850
我以為你有宗教信仰
I thought you were a religious man.

983
01:31:21,930 --> 01:31:24,560
你不明白 是吧
You don't understand, do you?

984
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:30,600
外面的世界對我們來說就如同不存在
That world out there doesn't exist for us anymore.

985
01:31:31,730 --> 01:31:34,480
我們有自己的小世界
We've got our own little world out here.

986
01:31:34,570 --> 01:31:38,240
不大 但只屬於我們
It ain't much, but it's ours.

987
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:42,120
其他人都滾蛋是嗎
So fuck everybody else.

988
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:45,910
是 滾蛋吧
No. Fuck them.

989
01:31:48,410 --> 01:31:50,500
- Dillon  - 嗯
- Hey, Dillon? - Yeah?

990
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:57,590
有個小小的問題
Uh, Dillon, we got a teeny-weeny problem.

991
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:16,320
太棒了
Fucking great!

992
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:20,030
他媽傻逼才給他鬆綁啊
Miserable, crazy son of a bitch let him loose.

993
01:32:20,110 --> 01:32:21,780
自作自受
Got what he fucking deserved.

994
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:26,030
那現在該怎麼辦
Well, now what are we gonna do?

995
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:30,330
Andrews說對了 那個豬頭就該銬起來
Andrews was right. Should've kept the shithead chained up.

996
01:32:30,410 --> 01:32:34,750
你還好嗎
You okay?

997
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:35,960
去她的 那怪物
Piss on her. The fucking

998
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:38,050
現在逍遙自在 我們怎麼辦
thing's loose out there. What are we gonna do?

999
01:32:38,130 --> 01:32:40,760
我剛說過了
I just said that.

1000
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:43,400
就是你這傻屌讓Golic逃走的
And you're the dumb prick that let Golic out.

1001
01:32:43,410 --> 01:32:44,890
你這坨討嫌的大便
You miserable little shit!

1002
01:32:44,970 --> 01:32:46,680
得了 別吵了
Come on. Cut that shit out.

1003
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:51,020
讓你那傻子好自為之
Tell your fucking bozo to shape up!

1004
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:53,390
你 你覺得呢
Wh-Wh-What do you think?

1005
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:55,650
我要到逃生艇去
l think I have to get to the E.E.V.

1006
01:32:55,730 --> 01:32:59,860
- 怎麼了  - 我得用用神經掃瞄儀
- Why? What's up? - I just have to use the neuroscanner.

1007
01:33:01,490 --> 01:33:03,610
- 你看起來很糟  - 管她媽看起來咋樣
- You don't look so good. - Who gives a shit how she looks?

1008
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:04,920
現在該做什麼啊
What are we gonna do?

1009
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:07,410
你嘴巴欠揍嗎 廢物
Want a smack in the mouth, you stupid wanker?

1010
01:33:07,490 --> 01:33:09,410
別吵了 別讓大家慌張
Shut the fuck up and stop causing panic!

1011
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:10,810
慌張 你太他媽蠢了
Panic- You're so fucking stupid,

1012
01:33:10,810 --> 01:33:12,960
你字都不會寫 別跟我談慌張
you couldn't spell it. Don't talk to me about panic.

1013
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:15,460
我們就該慌張 玩雞巴蛋了 這他媽誰的錯
We ought to panic! We're fucking screwed! Whose fault is that?

1014
01:33:15,540 --> 01:33:17,500
好了 都閉嘴
All right. Now shut up, both of you!

1015
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:21,670
閉嘴
Shut up!

1016
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:41,150
- 我想不出該怎麼辦  - 早料到了
- Well, I'm out of ideas! - Oh, surprise me.

1017
01:33:43,530 --> 01:33:46,030
- 出去怎麼樣  - 好主意
- What about outside? - Great idea.

1018
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:48,450
太陽兩天後才出來 現在外面零下40度
Sun don't come up for another two days. It's 40 below zero.

1019
01:33:48,530 --> 01:33:51,160
救援隊還有10個小時才到 所以這辦法好極了
The rescue team's 10 hours away. So that makes a lot of sense!

1020
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:52,540
太好了 你就想讓我們
Wonderful. You just want us to

1021
01:33:52,550 --> 01:33:54,580
待在這兒 等著那怪物來吃了我們嗎
stay here and let this thing have us for lunch!

1022
01:33:54,670 --> 01:33:58,290
把所有的人都聚集起來
I want you to get everybody that's still left together.

1023
01:33:58,380 --> 01:34:02,630
到大禮堂集合
Get 'em into the assembly hall.

1024
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,880
好吧
Okay.

1025
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:10,010
她去哪兒了
Where'd she go?

1026
01:34:36,790 --> 01:34:40,670
需要幫忙嗎
Need any help?

1027
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:44,670
我沒想嚇你
I don't mean to scare you.

1028
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:47,090
你真不該單獨亂走
You shouldn't be wandering around alone.

1029
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:50,350
幫我個忙 按下按鍵 好嗎
Do me a favor and run this keyboard, will you?

1030
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:53,850
好的
Okay.

1031
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,530
- 我按哪個  - B或者C
- What do I do? - Hit "B" Or "C."

1032
01:35:06,610 --> 01:35:08,280
C是什麼
What's "C"?

1033
01:35:08,410 --> 01:35:10,070
- 顯示生命機能  - 就是它
- "Display biofunctions." - That's it.

1034
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:16,580
好了 開始了 接下來呢
Okay, we're hot. Now what?

1035
01:35:16,660 --> 01:35:19,250
讓它跑一圈
Let it run a cycle.

1036
01:35:19,330 --> 01:35:21,460
很模糊啊
It's real fuzzy.

1037
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:24,630
按"增強"鍵
Hit "Enhancement."

1038
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:44,980
接著找
Keep looking.

1039
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:54,200
我不知道怎麼看
I don't know how to read this stuff.

1040
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:57,790
大出血就會有暗色塊
Hemorrhaging will show as a dark patch.

1041
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:06,050
找找
Look for...

1042
01:36:06,130 --> 01:36:08,970
在頭骨根部有沒有細微裂痕
hairline fractures through the base of the skull.

1043
01:36:09,090 --> 01:36:11,220
窄窄的白線
Little white lines.

1044
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:21,390
那是什麼
What is it?

1045
01:36:23,190 --> 01:36:24,980
好像你體內有一個
I think you've got one inside of you.

1046
01:36:27,030 --> 01:36:29,860
不可能吧
That's not possible.

1047
01:36:32,610 --> 01:36:35,030
看起來什麼樣子
What does it look like?

1048
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:43,580
- 太嚇人了  - 我得看看
- Horrible. - I have to see it.

1049
01:36:46,130 --> 01:36:48,050
- 凍結畫面  - 你最好別看
- Freeze it. - You don't want to look at it.

1050
01:36:48,130 --> 01:36:50,050
凍結畫面
Freeze it!

1051
01:37:15,530 --> 01:37:17,700
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1052
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:25,830
好了 那怪物就在外面遊蕩
All right. The fucking thing is loose. It's out there.

1053
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:29,300
救援隊帶著武器快到了
A rescue team is on its way with guns and shit.

1054
01:37:29,380 --> 01:37:31,880
眼下沒有哪個地方是安全的
Right now there isn't any place that's real safe.

1055
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:35,260
我們待在這個大廳
But we stay here, in the assembly hall.

1056
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:38,430
這兒沒有空調
This place never had any fucking air conditioning.

1057
01:37:38,510 --> 01:37:40,720
怪物要來 肯定是走大門
If it comes in, it's gotta be through one of these doors.

1058
01:37:40,810 --> 01:37:43,680
那我們就派人守衛 及時通報情況
Now we post a guard to let us know if it's coming.

1059
01:37:43,770 --> 01:37:49,020
同時 大家先躲好 時刻準備著
In the meantime, you lay low, be ready and stay right...

1060
01:37:49,110 --> 01:37:51,440
死期隨時可能到來
in case your time comes.

1061
01:37:51,530 --> 01:37:56,700
別編瞎話了 Dillon
Don't you start bullshitting, Dillon.

1062
01:37:56,780 --> 01:37:58,780
我們會像耗子一樣困在這兒
We're gonna be trapped in here like rats.

1063
01:37:58,870 --> 01:38:00,500
你有武器嗎 有刀嗎
You got a weapon? You got a blade?

1064
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,620
有他媽就拿出來用啊
Then you take it out and you fucking use it!

1065
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:04,340
對 所以你認為
Oh, right. So you think

1066
01:38:04,340 --> 01:38:07,460
我們用小刀就能捅死那雞巴怪物
we're gonna stab this motherfucker to death?

1067
01:38:07,540 --> 01:38:10,210
我認為個鬼 或許
No, I don't think shit! Maybe.

1068
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:13,210
或許在它殺死你之前你能傷到它
Maybe you'll hurt it before it takes you out, huh?

1069
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:16,680
這樣不行嗎 你們誰還有更好的主意
Isn't that something? Any of you got any better ideas?

1070
01:38:22,060 --> 01:38:26,480
告訴你們 在救援隊來之前 我們就等死吧
And I'll tell you, until the rescue team gets here, we're fucked!

1071
01:38:28,150 --> 01:38:31,150
所以你們最好準備好
So you better get prepared.

1072
01:38:38,490 --> 01:38:40,950
我才不留在這兒
Well, I ain't staying here.

1073
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:45,330
很好 隨你便
Well, then, suit yourself.

1074
01:38:51,670 --> 01:38:53,500
火
Fire.

1075
01:38:57,970 --> 01:39:02,810
- 熔爐  - 對 把它搞到熔爐裏
- Furnace. - Yeah. Let's make it to the furnace.

1076
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:07,980
我的天
Holy shit.

1077
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:11,900
很好
Well, all right.

1078
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:14,070
真他媽對
Fuckin' "A."

1079
01:39:14,150 --> 01:39:17,490
- 真他媽對  - 真他媽太對了
- Fuckin' "A." - Too fuckin' right it's right.

1080
01:39:35,550 --> 01:39:39,130
設定好了 你想說什麼
It's up. What do you want to say?

1081
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:42,550
告訴他們這裏毒素蔓延了
Tell them the whole place has gone toxic.

1082
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:45,350
開玩笑吧
Are you kidding?

1083
01:39:45,430 --> 01:39:47,890
這有他們就不會來了 救援隊就返回了啊
Then they won't come here. The rescue team will turn back.

1084
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:50,560
- 是的 我知道  - 你在說什麼啊
- Yeah. I know. - What are you talking about?

1085
01:39:50,650 --> 01:39:54,480
我們唯一的希望就是他們來把它殺了
Our only hope is that they kill this fucker.

1086
01:39:54,570 --> 01:39:56,570
並且也能給你想想辦法
And maybe they can do something for you.

1087
01:39:56,570 --> 01:39:57,820
冷凍起來 或許
I don't know, freeze you-

1088
01:39:57,900 --> 01:40:00,240
他們能給你做手術 他們有技術啊
They can do an operation. They've got the technology.

1089
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:04,120
如果異形從這兒逃走 它會毀滅一切
If this organism gets off the planet, it'll kill everything.

1090
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:06,490
公司不在乎這些
The company doesn't care about that.

1091
01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:09,540
他們只想拿去生化武器部門 好嗎
They just want it for their bioweapons division, okay?

1092
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:13,330
我們不能讓他們來
So we can't let them come here.

1093
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:15,500
去你的
Fuck you.

1094
01:40:15,590 --> 01:40:16,920
我很遺憾你體內
Look, I'm sorry you've got

1095
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:19,340
有個這東西 但是我想活命啊
this thing inside you, but I'm getting rescued.

1096
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:20,820
我不是在乎這些蠢囚犯
I don't give a shit about these

1097
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:22,840
我有老婆 孩子啊
stupid prisoners, but I've got a wife, I've got a kid.

1098
01:40:22,930 --> 01:40:25,930
- 下一班就輪到我回家了啊  - 我知道 這很難
- I'll go home on the next rotation! - I know. This is hard.

1099
01:40:26,010 --> 01:40:29,680
我要這麼發訊息 你他媽給我密碼
I'm gonna send this message. I need that fucking code.

1100
01:40:29,770 --> 01:40:32,770
抱歉 寶貝 這是機密
I'm sorry, babe. It's classified.

1101
01:40:32,850 --> 01:40:35,650
聽著 你個傻逼 必須這麼辦 知道嗎
Listen, you stupid little shit! This has got to be done, okay?

1102
01:40:35,770 --> 01:40:38,190
- 沒有其他辦法了  - 沒門兒
- There are no alternatives! - No way!

1103
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:41,360
別想知道密碼 不可能
You're not getting it! No fucking way!

1104
01:40:47,870 --> 01:40:50,040
聽著 我跟你無冤無仇
Look, it's nothing personal.

1105
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:52,620
明白嗎
Understand?

1106
01:40:52,710 --> 01:40:54,790
你會沒事的
I think you're okay.

1107
01:41:00,130 --> 01:41:01,630
謝謝
Thanks.

1108
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:13,520
你有什麼主意嗎
Have you got any ideas?

1109
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:18,230
它不會殺我的
It won't kill me.

1110
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,740
我懷著皇后
I'm carrying the new queen.

1111
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:23,990
它不會扼殺自己的未來
It won't kill its future.

1112
01:41:24,110 --> 01:41:28,910
你真認為怪物這麼聰明
You really wanna bet this thing's that smart?

1113
01:41:28,990 --> 01:41:33,500
我會去找它 看它到底有多聰明
Maybe I'll go find it. See how smart it is.

1114
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:36,920
- 你要去找它  - 對
- You're gonna go and look for it? - Yeah.

1115
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,590
我大概知道它在哪兒
I have a pretty good idea of where it is.

1116
01:41:40,670 --> 01:41:45,630
它就在下面 在地下室
It's just down there... in the basement.

1117
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:49,310
這整個地方就是地下室
This whole place is a basement.

1118
01:41:49,390 --> 01:41:54,060
這是比喻 你來嗎
It's a metaphor. Wanna come?

1119
01:41:56,860 --> 01:42:01,980
操
Fuck me.

1120
01:43:22,610 --> 01:43:24,440
我需要你的時候你在哪裏
Where are you when I need you?

1121
01:43:57,140 --> 01:43:59,390
別害怕
Don't be afraid.

1122
01:44:01,610 --> 01:44:03,610
我也是家族成員啊
I'm part of the family.

1123
01:45:10,630 --> 01:45:13,680
你闖入我生活這麼久
You've been in my life so long,

1124
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:16,300
我都不記得其他事了
I can't remember anything else.

1125
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:20,680
現在幫個忙吧
Now do something for me.

1126
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:24,480
很簡單
It's easy.

1127
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:27,360
只要
Just-

1128
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:30,280
只要順從你的天性
Just do what you do.

1129
01:46:14,530 --> 01:46:16,870
- 它不殺我  - 你在這兒幹什麼
- It won't kill me. - What are you doing out here?

1130
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:18,410
你應該躺著休息
You're supposed to be laying low.

1131
01:46:18,490 --> 01:46:22,080
我體內也有一隻
I have one inside of me.

1132
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:23,790
大的那只不願意殺死同類
Big one won't kill its own.

1133
01:46:23,910 --> 01:46:27,040
- 你在說什麼  - 我剛遇見它了
- What are you talking about? - I just saw it,

1134
01:46:27,130 --> 01:46:29,790
一小時前
an hour ago.

1135
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:32,250
我就站在它旁邊
I stood right next to it.

1136
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:36,340
本來我就是午飯 但它就是不碰我
I could've been lunch, but it wouldn't touch me.

1137
01:46:36,430 --> 01:46:38,970
它跑了
It ran away.

1138
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:42,350
它知道我懷著種族的未來
It knows I'm carrying its future.

1139
01:46:42,430 --> 01:46:45,600
胡扯 你怎麼知道你體內也有
Aw, bullshit. How do you know that thing's inside you?

1140
01:46:45,690 --> 01:46:49,270
我看到了 在斷層掃瞄圖上
I saw it... on the CAT scan.

1141
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:54,440
是個皇后 專門產卵的
It's a queen- an egg layer.

1142
01:46:54,530 --> 01:46:56,530
它會生出上千個這種怪物的
It can make thousands more like the one we've got here.

1143
01:46:56,610 --> 01:47:00,320
聽起來還是胡說八道
Still sounds like bullshit to me.

1144
01:47:00,410 --> 01:47:03,290
如果在你體內 它是怎麼進去的
If that thing's inside you, how'd it get there?

1145
01:47:03,370 --> 01:47:07,580
不知道
I don't know.

1146
01:47:07,670 --> 01:47:10,080
在我深度睡眠的時候吧
When I was in hypersleep, l guess.

1147
01:47:10,170 --> 01:47:12,380
我被侵犯了
I was violated.

1148
01:47:14,130 --> 01:47:16,800
現在我成了准媽媽
Now I get to be the mother.

1149
01:47:20,260 --> 01:47:23,930
我沒有多少時間了
I don't have much time,

1150
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:27,350
也沒法做該做的事
and I can't do what I should.

1151
01:47:29,810 --> 01:47:31,810
我需要你幫助我
I need you to help me.

1152
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:38,400
我要你殺了我
I need you to kill me.

1153
01:47:38,490 --> 01:47:42,120
- 你他媽在說什麼  - 反正我也死定了
- What the fuck are you talking about? - I'm dead anyway.

1154
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:45,790
我活不了的
I can't survive it.

1155
01:47:45,870 --> 01:47:48,870
但我體內的怪物能繁殖上千個後代
But the one inside of me can generate thousands more,

1156
01:47:50,630 --> 01:47:53,420
整個宇宙都難逃浩劫
can wipe out the whole universe.

1157
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:56,000
它必須死
It has to die.

1158
01:47:56,090 --> 01:47:58,550
所以必須殺了我
So somebody's gotta kill me.

1159
01:48:01,140 --> 01:48:03,180
你辦得到嗎
Are you up to it?

1160
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:07,220
這你不用擔心
You don't have to worry about that.

1161
01:48:24,740 --> 01:48:26,790
不用說悼詞
No speeches.

1162
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,250
也不用祈禱
No prayers.

1163
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:06,200
- 怎麼了  - 我不喜歡認輸
- What's going on? - I don't like losing a fight.

1164
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:08,490
對任何人或任何東西
Not to nobody, not to nothing.

1165
01:49:08,620 --> 01:49:13,080
操 那個該死的怪物殺了我一半兄弟
Fuck. That damn thing out there has already killed half my men,

1166
01:49:13,170 --> 01:49:15,000
另一半也嚇得屁滾尿流
got the other half scared shitless.

1167
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:16,510
只要它還活著 姐妹
As long as it's alive, sister,

1168
01:49:16,510 --> 01:49:18,170
你就救不了全宇宙
you're not gonna save any universe.

1169
01:49:18,250 --> 01:49:19,880
你答應了要殺我的
You said you were gonna kill me.

1170
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:24,130
- 你他媽膽小鬼  - 我要捉住那個怪物
- You fucking coward! - I want that thing!

1171
01:49:24,220 --> 01:49:27,720
我要你幫我逮住它
I want to get this thing, and I need you to do it.

1172
01:49:27,810 --> 01:49:31,980
如果它不殺你 那說不定對我們有利
And if it won't kill you, then maybe that helps us fight it.

1173
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:35,980
否則 操你媽的
Otherwise, fuck you!

1174
01:49:36,110 --> 01:49:39,110
自己動手吧
Go kill yourself.

1175
01:49:43,110 --> 01:49:45,490
Dillon
Dillon.

1176
01:49:46,870 --> 01:49:48,700
我們先處理了那怪物
We waste this thing,

1177
01:49:50,540 --> 01:49:52,660
- 然後你要除掉我  - 沒問題
- then you take care of me. - No problem.

1178
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,670
你會死得毫無知覺
Quick, easy and painless.

1179
01:50:02,260 --> 01:50:04,590
由你們自己決定
This is the choice.

1180
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:08,600
是在這坐以待斃還是奮戰到死
You die sitting here on your ass, or you die out there.

1181
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:12,270
至少我們該試試 讓它好看
At least we take a shot. We owe it one.

1182
01:50:12,350 --> 01:50:16,770
它把我們害死了 應該來個以牙還牙
It's fucked us up. Maybe we can get even for the others.

1183
01:50:18,060 --> 01:50:20,770
- 你們想怎麼做  - 你在胡扯什麼
- Now how do you want it? - What the fuck are you talking about?

1184
01:50:20,860 --> 01:50:23,490
我說殺了那個傻逼怪物
I'm talkin' about killing that big motherfucker.

1185
01:50:23,570 --> 01:50:26,820
別急 別急 救援隊就要來了
Hold it, hold it. The rescue team's on its way.

1186
01:50:26,910 --> 01:50:30,160
我們只要等著就好
We could just sit this out.

1187
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:33,040
- 救援隊來幹嘛  - 救我們啊
- Rescue team for whom? - For us.

1188
01:50:34,910 --> 01:50:38,000
他們只想要怪物 你知道的
They just want the beast. You know that.

1189
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,750
我才不管他們要什麼
I don't give a damn what they want.

1190
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:42,000
他們又不會把我們一個個幹掉的
They're not gonna pick us off one by one, are they?

1191
01:50:42,090 --> 01:50:43,760
那可不一定
I wouldn't be so sure.

1192
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:46,090
拜託 他們就是來接我們回去的
Come on. They're gonna take us home.

1193
01:50:46,180 --> 01:50:47,470
他們不會帶我們回去的
They're not gonna take us home.

1194
01:50:47,550 --> 01:50:49,470
但我們也不必出去拚命啊
Still doesn't mean we should go out and fight it.

1195
01:50:49,550 --> 01:50:51,380
天吶 都消停會兒好嗎
Jesus Christ! Give us a break!

1196
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:53,600
你們他媽全瘋了
You guys have got to be fucking nuts!

1197
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:54,960
我有老婆 有孩子啊
Look, I've got a wife and a kid.

1198
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:56,310
沒人鳥你 85
Nobody gives a shit about you, 85.

1199
01:50:56,390 --> 01:50:58,900
你不是我們成員 你不信教
You're not one of us. You're not a believer.

1200
01:50:58,980 --> 01:51:01,650
- 你他媽是個公司走狗  - 好吧
- You're a fucking company man! - Yeah, okay.

1201
01:51:01,730 --> 01:51:04,530
好 我是公司員工 我他媽又不是囚犯
Okay, I'm a company man and not a fucking criminal.

1202
01:51:04,610 --> 01:51:07,110
你們一直嘲笑我智商
You keep telling me how dumb I am.

1203
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:09,410
起碼我比你們聰明 你們一輩子關在這裏
Well, I'm smart enough not to have a life sentence on this rock!

1204
01:51:09,490 --> 01:51:11,280
- 操你媽  - 滾蛋去 85
- Fuck you! - Piss off, 85!

1205
01:51:11,410 --> 01:51:13,320
起碼我比你們聰明
Yeah, and l'm smart enough to wait for

1206
01:51:13,330 --> 01:51:16,000
知道等著武器來了再投入戰鬥
some firepower to show up before we fight this thing!

1207
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:17,750
對吧 Morse
Right, Morse?

1208
01:51:17,830 --> 01:51:20,540
對 好了 你就乖乖坐在這兒 沒問題
Right. Okay. Just sit here on your asses. Fine.

1209
01:51:20,630 --> 01:51:23,420
我也乖乖坐在這兒怎麼樣
How about if I sit here on my ass?

1210
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:26,970
沒問題 哦 我忘了
No problem. Oh, I forgot.

1211
01:51:27,050 --> 01:51:29,010
你和上帝商量過
You're the guy that's made a deal with God...

1212
01:51:29,090 --> 01:51:31,720
你要獲得永生是吧
to live forever, huh?

1213
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:36,100
你們其餘這群慫貨也坐著吧
And all the rest of you pussies can sit it out too.

1214
01:51:36,180 --> 01:51:39,270
我和她會負責戰鬥
Me and her'll do all the fighting.

1215
01:51:39,350 --> 01:51:42,360
好吧 我也想殺死它
Okay. But I want the same thing as you.

1216
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:45,480
我想看著它死 我也恨它 它也殺了我兄弟
I want to see it dead. I hate the fucker! It killed my mates too!

1217
01:51:45,570 --> 01:51:47,190
但他媽為什麼不等到
Why the fuck can't we wait

1218
01:51:47,190 --> 01:51:50,110
公司的人來了再拿著槍去幹它呢
for the company and have some guns on our side?

1219
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:53,780
- 怎麼他媽就非得急著去送死呢  - 對
- Why do we have to go on some fucking suicide run? - Right.

1220
01:51:53,870 --> 01:51:55,450
因為公司不會殺它的
Because they won't kill it.

1221
01:51:55,540 --> 01:51:57,640
他們可能會殺了你們封鎖消息
They might kill you just for having seen it.

1222
01:51:57,640 --> 01:51:59,080
但絕不會殺它
But they're not gonna kill it.

1223
01:51:59,170 --> 01:52:03,460
太扯了 簡直是滿嘴狗屎 他們不可能會殺我們啊
That is crazy! That is horseshit! They will not kill us!

1224
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:09,010
當他們一聽到異形
When they first heard about this thing,

1225
01:52:09,090 --> 01:52:11,390
就說 必要時可犧牲船員
it was "Crew expendable."

1226
01:52:11,470 --> 01:52:16,180
接下來派去的海軍陸戰隊 也說可以犧牲
The next time they sent in marines. They were expendable too.

1227
01:52:16,270 --> 01:52:17,450
憑什麼你就覺得
What makes you think

1228
01:52:17,450 --> 01:52:20,100
他們會在乎你們這幫
they're gonna care about a bunch of lifers...

1229
01:52:20,190 --> 01:52:24,110
在外太空尋求上帝的囚犯呢
who found God at the ass end of space?

1230
01:52:24,190 --> 01:52:26,530
難道你們天真以為
You really think they're going to let you...

1231
01:52:26,610 --> 01:52:28,860
他們會讓你們打亂他們的計劃
interfere with their plans for this thing?

1232
01:52:30,030 --> 01:52:32,610
他們認為我們是敗類啊
They think we're- we're crud.

1233
01:52:32,700 --> 01:52:36,030
他們也壓根不會在乎你們朋友的
And they don't give a fuck about one friend of yours...

1234
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:38,330
死活
that's- that's died.

1235
01:52:38,410 --> 01:52:40,160
你們全都一樣
Not one.

1236
01:52:44,250 --> 01:52:46,290
你有什麼計劃呢
Have you got some sort of plan?

1237
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:49,170
這是個鑄鉛場 是吧
This is a lead works, isn't it?

1238
01:52:49,260 --> 01:52:53,300
我們只要把那傻逼怪物引到模子裏
All we got to do is lure the fucking beast into the mold,

1239
01:52:53,390 --> 01:52:55,600
再用鉛水澆它
drown it in hot lead.

1240
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:58,810
好吧 怎麼才能做到啊
All right. So how do we do that?

1241
01:52:58,890 --> 01:53:02,190
我們用什麼引誘它呢
Yeah. What are we gonna use for bait?

1242
01:53:08,530 --> 01:53:13,320
- 哦 操  - 我們早晚得死
- Oh, fuck! - We're all gonna die.

1243
01:53:13,410 --> 01:53:16,320
問題是什麼時候罷了
The only question is when.

1244
01:53:16,410 --> 01:53:20,040
這兒也和其他地方一樣好
This is as good a place as any...

1245
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:23,290
是你們走向天堂的第一步
to take your first steps to heaven.

1246
01:53:23,370 --> 01:53:26,210
問題只是怎麼死罷了
Only question is how you check out.

1247
01:53:28,050 --> 01:53:31,010
你想站著死呢
Do you want it on your feet...

1248
01:53:31,090 --> 01:53:34,890
還是他媽跪著哀求著死去
or on your fucking knees, begging?

1249
01:53:34,970 --> 01:53:37,470
我可不會哀求
I ain't much for begging.

1250
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:40,390
從沒有人施捨過我什麼
Nobody ever gave me nothin'.

1251
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:43,770
所以我要干翻它 跟他拚命
So I say fuck that thing! Let's fight it!

1252
01:53:49,230 --> 01:53:52,240
操 干他去吧
Fuck it! Let's go for it!

1253
01:53:55,740 --> 01:53:59,490
- 搞死它  - 它如果衝過來怎麼辦
- Let's kick its fucking ass. - What if it runs at us?

1254
01:53:59,580 --> 01:54:02,080
這主意太棒了
That's a fucking good idea.

1255
01:54:05,670 --> 01:54:09,670
A隧道 1號門打開
Channel "A," Door 1 open.

1256
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:12,010
這裏上次使用是什麼時候
When was the last time you used this place?

1257
01:54:12,090 --> 01:54:14,340
五六年前開過
We fired it up five, six years ago.

1258
01:54:14,430 --> 01:54:16,050
你確保活塞能用嗎
You sure the piston's gonna work?

1259
01:54:16,140 --> 01:54:18,430
這鬼地方什麼都不能確保
There's nothing for sure in this place.

1260
01:54:23,230 --> 01:54:26,650
我們把它困在這兒 你拉把手 開啟活塞
We trap it here first, then you pull the lever, start the piston.

1261
01:54:26,730 --> 01:54:27,610
然後活塞會把它
Then the piston's gonna

1262
01:54:27,620 --> 01:54:29,230
一直推到模子裏
push the motherfucker right into the mold.

1263
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:31,470
然後再澆鉛水就好
Then one of the guys will pour the lead.

1264
01:54:31,470 --> 01:54:33,030
它就死了 遊戲結束
End of his ass. End of story.

1265
01:54:33,110 --> 01:54:34,440
萬一有人掉鏈子了呢
What if somebody screws it up?

1266
01:54:34,450 --> 01:54:35,900
那就完蛋了 只有一次機會
We're fucked. You got one chance.

1267
01:54:35,990 --> 01:54:38,780
只許成功 不許失敗
One shot at it. That's all.

1268
01:54:38,870 --> 01:54:40,990
沒時間重新再來
We'll never have time to reset it.

1269
01:54:40,990 --> 01:54:43,370
記住 你拉把手時
Now remember, when you pull the lever,

1270
01:54:43,450 --> 01:54:45,200
會有那麼幾秒鐘
for a few seconds you're gonna

1271
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:47,710
你和那雞巴怪物都困在這兒
be trapped in here with that fuckin' thing.

1272
01:54:47,790 --> 01:54:50,040
你們不出岔子 我也不會
If you guys don't drop the ball, I won't.

1273
01:54:50,130 --> 01:54:53,050
它最好真的不會殺你
Well, you just better be right about that thing not wanting you.

1274
01:54:53,130 --> 01:54:56,090
因為它要出去 就只有那一條路
Because if it wants out, that's how it's gonna go.

1275
01:54:56,180 --> 01:54:58,840
通過凹室 通過你
Through that alcove, through you.

1276
01:54:58,970 --> 01:55:01,470
- 那你在哪兒  - 我在附近
- Where are you gonna be? - I'll be around.

1277
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:05,230
- 其他人呢 他們在哪兒  - 禱告
- What about the others? Where are they? - Praying.

1278
01:55:10,310 --> 01:55:15,110
- 你相信天堂這套嗎  - 不知道
- You believe in this heaven shit? Eh? - I don't know.

1279
01:55:15,190 --> 01:55:17,530
我也是
Me neither.

1280
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:24,040
操 但是還有什麼其他能信呢
Fuck it, though. What else have we got to believe in?

1281
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:27,290
說得太他媽對了
Say that for fucking sure.

1282
01:55:33,130 --> 01:55:36,460
搞雞毛啊 是吧
What the fuck, right?

1283
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:56,860
安靜 我聽不到
Silence! I can't hear-

1284
01:56:00,870 --> 01:56:04,370
啟動吧
Let's launch this thing!

1285
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:16,710
B隧道 7號門
Channel "B," Door 7.

1286
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:21,050
這他媽怎麼回事
I don't know about this shit.

1287
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:26,810
- 嘿 各位 我的門壞了  - 他他媽說啥
- Hey, guys! My door ain't working! - What the fuck's he saying?

1288
01:56:26,890 --> 01:56:29,940
我們應該再計劃計劃
I think we'd better rethink this thing!

1289
01:56:34,820 --> 01:56:38,150
有人聽到什麼異常嗎
Did anybody hear anything?

1290
01:56:48,910 --> 01:56:52,080
來啊 來追我啊 你個畜生
Come on! Come and get me, you fucker!

1291
01:56:53,500 --> 01:56:55,460
它在追我
It's behind me!

1292
01:56:56,090 --> 01:57:00,170
- 開始了  - 還在追
- It's starting. - Still behind me!

1293
01:57:00,260 --> 01:57:02,880

1294
01:57:02,970 --> 01:57:06,470
還在追 快關門
Still coming! Shut the doors!

1295
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:09,100
一定朝A隧道去了
Must be heading over to Channel "A"!

1296
01:57:14,020 --> 01:57:16,650
這怪物被完全激怒了
This thing is really pissed off!

1297
01:57:16,730 --> 01:57:19,150
- 你剛說B嗎  - 不 E
- Did you say "B"? - No, "E"!

1298
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:21,440
- 但你讓我們待著  - 快他媽跑
- But you said we should stay here! - Move your fucking ass!

1299
01:57:22,780 --> 01:57:24,450

1305
01:58:03,490 --> 01:58:05,160
A隧道 七號門關閉
A-7 closed.

1306
01:58:10,040 --> 01:58:14,660
打開東翼 B7號門安全

How did I get here?

1311
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:48,280
他們他媽是去哪兒 怎麼不按計劃
Where the hell are they going? What about the plan?

1312
01:58:48,370 --> 01:58:50,700
- 你免疫了 他們沒有  - 那該怎麼辦
- Look, you're immune, they're not. - So what are we doing?

1313
01:58:53,450 --> 01:58:55,910
- 隨機應變  - 我們隨機應變
- Improvising! - We're improvising.

1314
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,670
太好了
Great.

待在這兒
Stay here.

1337
02:00:47,490 --> 02:00:49,990

Where the hell is it?

1338
