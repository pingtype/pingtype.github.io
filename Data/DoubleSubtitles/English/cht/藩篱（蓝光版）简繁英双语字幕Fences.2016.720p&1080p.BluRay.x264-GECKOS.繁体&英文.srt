1
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,860
Troy, 你別再說謊了
Troy, you ought to stop that lying.

2
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,560
我沒有說謊
I ain't lying.

3
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,430
那個黑人藏著個這麼大的西瓜
Nigger had a watermelon this big,

4
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,370
還說: 什麼西瓜, Mr. Rand?
talking about, "what watermelon, Mr. Rand?"

5
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,100
我真想上前跟他對質, 還"什麼西瓜, Mr. Rand?"
I'd like to fell out. "What watermelon, Mr. Rand?"

6
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,810
那個西瓜就大大的放在那
And it sitting there, big as life.

7
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,910
- 那Mr. Rand說了什麼?   - 他沒說什麼
- What Mr. Rand say?   - He ain't said nothing.

8
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,580
他知道, 如果這個黑人那麼愚蠢
He figure, if the nigger was too dumb

9
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,740
不知道自己在藏著一個西瓜
to know he's carrying a watermelon,

10
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,680
他也不能跟他說道理
he wasn't going to get much sense out of him.

11
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,580
他把那大西瓜藏在他的外衣下
Trying to hide that great, big, old watermelon under his coat.

12
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,390
害怕讓那些白人看到他偷回家
Afraid to let the white man see him carry it home.

13
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,720
我像你一樣, 我沒有時間跟這種蠢人相處
I'm like you. I ain't got no time for them kinda people.

14
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,460
告訴我, 為何那個人看起來那麼生氣
Now, what he look like getting mad

15
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,490
在他看到從工會來的人跟Mr. Rand說話之後?
'cause he seen the man from the union talking to Mr. Rand?

16
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,890
他上前跟我說
He come up to me, talking about

17
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,730
Troy Maxson早晚會讓我們失去工作的
"Troy Maxson gonna get us fired."

18
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,900
我跟他說:別跟我說這個
I told him, "get away from me with that."

19
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,630
他一邊走一邊說你是專門製造麻煩的人
He walked away from me calling you a troublemaker.

20
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,630
Mr. Rand怎樣說?
What Mr. Rand say?

21
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,470
他沒說什麼, 只叫我
He ain't said nothing. Told me to go down

22
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,410
下星期五到理事長的辦公室, 停下!
to the commissioner's office next Friday. Whoa!

23
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,870
他們叫我去那裏會面
They called me down there to see them.

24
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,440
你一天還在投訴當中
Well, as long as you got your complaint filed,

25
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,410
他們就不能辭退你
they can't fire you.

26
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,810
那是一個白人跟我說的
That's what one of them white fellas tell me.

27
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,150
我才不擔心他們會辭退我
I ain't worried about them firing me.

28
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,620
就因為我問了個問題, 他們就要辭退我?
What, they gonna fire me 'cause I asked a question?

29
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,720
我只問了個問題
That's all I did.

30
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,790
我問Mr. Rand
I went to Mr. Rand and I asked him.

31
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,060
我問他: 為何?
I asked him, "why?

32
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,190
為何你讓所有白人負責駕駛, 而有色人種就去搬運?
Why you got all the white mens driving, and the colored lifting?"

33
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,190
跟他說:什麼事了? 我不重要嗎?
Told him, "what's the matter? Don't I count?

34
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,460
你以為只有白人才夠聰明去駕駛嗎?
Think only white fellows got sense enough to drive a truck?"

35
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,660
該死的, 那又不是寫文件, 任何人都懂駕駛
"Hell, that ain't no paper job. Anybody can drive a truck.

36
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,930
你為何讓所有白人駕駛, 而有色人種去搬運?
"How come you got all the whites driving and the colored lifting?"

37
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,900
他回答我: 去跟工會說吧
He told me, "take it to the union."

38
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,470
該死的, 我就去投訴
Well, hell, that's what I done.

39
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,640
而現在他們就想說一堆謊話隱瞞過去
Now they want to come up with this pack of lies.

40
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,970
我跟Brownie說了, 如果那些人向他查詢
I told Brownie if the man come and ask him any questions,

41
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,580
就即管告訴事實
just tell the truth.

42
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,480
這只不過是因為你投訴了
Ain't nothing but somebody trumped it up on you

43
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,610
所以有人要誣蔑你
'cause you filed a complaint on.

44
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,850
Brownie沒那麼聰明
Brownie ain't got that much sense.

45
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,180
他什麼事也不去想
Man wasn't thinking about nothing.

46
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,950
我只想他們改正職位描述
All I want them to do is change the job description,

47
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,520
給所有人一個機會去駕駛, 開車
give everybody a chance to drive the truck. Oi!

48
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,590
Brownie沒想過這, 他不是很聰明
Brownie can't see that. He ain't got that much sense.

49
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,910
你怎麼知道他一直在跟
How you figure he be making out

50
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,580
Taylor的酒吧裏那個女子調情?
with that gal, be up in Taylors' all the time?

51
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,250
- 那個叫Alberta的女子   - 誰?
- That Alberta gal?   - Who?

52
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,220
Brownie.
Brownie.

53
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,020
我跟他經常在一起, 就像我們一樣,
Same as you and me, getting about as much as we is.

54
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,760
- 心照不宣吧   - 是嗎?
- Which is to say nothing.   - It is, huh?

55
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,490
我想你比我更猜得透他吧
Well, I figure you doing a little better than me.

56
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,890
我不會跟你說我在猜什麼
And I ain't saying what I'm doing!

57
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,860
朋友, 聽著, 我太瞭解你
Nigger, look here. I know you.

58
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,900
難怕你只接近了她一點
If you had gotten anywhere near that gal,

59
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,270
二十分鐘後你就想跟誰說了
20 minutes later, you'd be looking to tell somebody.

60
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,770
而你第一個想要分享的對象
And the first one you gonna want to tell,

61
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,800
想要吹噓的對象就是我
that you gonna want to brag to is going to be me.

62
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,270
我不會這樣做
Oh, I ain't saying that.

63
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,570
我看到你在偷看她
I see where you be eyeing her.

64
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,840
我所有女人都看, 我不會錯過任何女人
I eye all the women. I don't miss nothing.

65
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,150
別聽別人說...
Don't never let nobody tell you

66
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,180
Troy Maxson不看女人
Troy Maxson don't eye the women.

67
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,650
你顗覦她呢
Hey, you been doing more than eyeing her.

68
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,920
你請她喝酒了
You done bought her a drink or two.

69
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,250
天啊, 我是請過她, 那又如何?
Hell, yeah, I bought her a drink. What that mean?

70
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,620
我也請過你喝酒
I bought you one, too.

71
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,250
那算什麼, 就因為我請她喝了一杯?
What that mean, 'cause I buy her a drink?

72
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,550
我只是出於禮貌
I'm just being polite.

73
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,760
你請她喝一杯完全可以
It's all right to buy her one drink.

74
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,620
那就是出於禮貌
That's what you call being polite.

75
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,290
但當你繼續請她喝酒
But when you want to be buying two or three,

76
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,830
那就是顗覦
that's what you call eyeing her.

77
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,660
聽著, 你認識我這樣久了
Look here. As long as you've known me,

78
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,630
你有聽過我去追求女人嗎?
you ever known me to chase after women?

79
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,870
當然有, 一直認識你以來你都有
Hell, yeah! Long as I've known you.

80
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,300
你忘了我認識你多久了
You're forgetting, I knew you when.

81
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,570
我在說在我跟Rose結婚後
I'm talking about since I been married to Rose.

82
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,740
噢...那倒沒有
Oh... not since you been married to Rose.

83
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,270
我可以說, 那倒是真的
That's the truth, though. I can say that.

84
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,910
明白了吧, 沒什麼可說
All right then. Case closed.

85
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,280
我在Alberta的房子外看見過你
I see you be walking up around Alberta's house.

86
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,750
那種時候你應該在Taylor的酒吧才對
You supposed to be at Taylors',

87
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,050
而你卻在那裏出現了
and you be walking up around there.

88
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,320
你為何在意我去哪?
What you watching where I'm walking for?

89
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,490
我也沒在意你去哪
I don't be watching after you.

90
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,650
不, 我看見你在那裏不只一次
No, I seen you walking around there more than once.

91
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,130
當然, 我們經常在一起
Hell, you liable to see me walking anywhere.

92
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,990
你看到我在那裏不代表什麼
That don't mean nothing 'cause you seen me walking around there.

93
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,320
她從哪來的?
Where'd she come from, anyway?

94
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,760
她就好像突然出現一樣
She just kinda showed up one day.

95
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,060
塔拉哈西, 你看到她
Tallahassee. You can look at that

96
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,030
就知道她是來自佛羅里達州 [塔拉哈西是其首都]
and tell she one of them Florida gals.

97
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,570
那裏的女人都亭亭玉立
They got some big, healthy women down there.

98
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,300
就像樹一樣高大
Grow them right up out of the ground.

99
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,940
她有印度人的血統
She got a little bit of Indian in her.

100
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,900
很多在佛羅里達州的黑人都有印度人血統
Most of them niggers in Florida got some Indian in them.

101
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,970
我不知道她是不是混血兒
Yeah, I don't know about that Indian part,

102
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,010
但她真的很高大
but she damn sure big and healthy.

103
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,080
要是讓她穿上長襪
Woman wears some big stockings.

104
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,620
再張開她那雙誘人的腿, 真棒
Got them crazy big legs, and hips wide as the Mississippi river.

105
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,950
雙腿並不重要
Legs don't mean nothing.

106
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,790
它們只會在做愛時阻礙你
You don't do nothing but push 'em out of the way.

107
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,350
但是臀部可重要了
But them hips,

108
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,790
它們坐在你上面時軟呼呼的
they cushion the ride.

109
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,590
Troy, 不能這樣算
Troy, you ain't got no sense!

110
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,660
那是真的, 像你年輕做愛時一樣
It's the truth. Like you riding on goodyears!

111
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,700
你們在這裏都在聊什麼了?
What you all out here getting into?

112
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,930
女人, 你為何在意我們在聊什麼?
What you worried about what we getting into for, woman?

113
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,010
這是男人之間的討論
This is men talk.

114
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,640
我又怎麼會在意呢?
What I care what you all are talking about?

115
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,940
Bono, 你要留下來吃晚餐嗎?
Bono, you gonna stay for supper?

116
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,340
不了, 謝謝, Rose
No, thank you, Rose,

117
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,770
Lucille說她今晚要煮豬腳
but Lucille say she cooking up a pot of pigfeet.

118
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,840
豬腳? 那我也跟你回去了
Pigfeet? Hell, I'm going home with you.

119
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,110
要是你家煮豬腳, 我甚至會在你那睡一晚
I might even stay the night, you got some pigfeet.

120
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,050
Rose, 你裏面有煮什麼比豬腳還棒的嗎?
You got something in there to top them pigfeet, Rose?

121
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,620
我在煮雞肉, 今晚吃雞肉和羽衣甘藍葉
I'm cooking up some chicken. I got some chicken and collard greens.

122
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,820
那你先進去繼續烹調
Well, you go on back in the house.

123
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,050
讓Bono和我繼續剛才的話題
Let me and Bono finish what we talking about.

124
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,920
這是男人之間的討論, 我待會也有些事要跟你討論
This is men talk. I got some talk for you later.

125
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,960
你也知道我要說什麼的
And you know what kind of talk I mean, too.

126
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,690
你先進去準備下 [指做愛]
You go on in there and powder it up.

127
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:34,990
Troy, 夠了!
Troy, stop it!

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,030
噢, 來吧, 女人
Oh, woman, come here.

129
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,400
Bono, 聽著
Oh! Look here, Bono.

130
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,940
我第一次看到這女人時
When I first met this woman,

131
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,840
我就行動了
I got out that place there.

132
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,840
我準備好我的馬匹
Hitch up my pony, saddle up my mare

133
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,640
因為那裏有個女人在等著我
there's a woman out there for me somewhere

134
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,380
我到處找尋她的蹤影
I looked at here, looked at there,

135
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,710
然後看到Rose時我就徹底被她迷住了
saw Rose, and I latched on to her.

136
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,680
我想也沒想就上前跟她說...
I latched on to her and I told her...

137
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,050
我來告訴你當時到底發生了什麼事
Now, I'm gonna tell you the truth.

138
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,720
我跟她說: 寶貝, 我不想要結婚
I latched on to her and told her, "baby, I don't want to marry.

139
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,190
我只想成為你的男人
"I just want to be your man."

140
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,890
Rose回答我... 你來告訴他, Ro
Rose told me... Tell him what you told me, Ro.

141
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,860
我跟他說如果他不打算長相廝守
I told him if he wasn't the marrying kind,

142
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,030
那就滾開, 別擋著那些想的人前來
then move out of the way, so the marrying kind could find me.

143
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,730
她真這麼說了: 朋友, 你在擋著我
That's what she told me, "nigger, you in my way.

144
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,000
你在阻擋我的視線
"You blocking the view.

145
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
滾開, 讓我找我的愛人
"Move out the way, so I can find me a husband."

146
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,740
- 我想了幾天    - 你才沒有
- I thought it over 2-3 days.   - Two-three days, nothing.

147
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,070
你那晚就回來了
You was back the same night.

148
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,410
我回來並跟她說: 好吧, 寶貝
I come back, told her, "okay, baby,

149
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,150
但我要買一隻矮腳公雞 [比正常公雞小, 但好鬥]
"but I'm gonna buy me a banty rooster

150
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,980
把它放在後院裏
"and put him out there in the backyard.

151
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,690
當它看到陌生人
"And when he see a stranger come,

152
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,420
它就會到處跑跟大聲啼叫
"he gonna flap his wings and crow."

153
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,290
Bono, 看這裏, 我看著前門就夠煩了
Look here, Bono. I done watched that front door by myself.

154
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,990
我擔心的是[她的]後庭
It was that back door I was worried about.

155
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,820
Troy, 別說了, 你在撒謊
Don't talk like that! Troy, you're not but telling a lie.

156
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,190
但是我們結婚後才發現
Only thing was, we first got married,

157
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,930
忘了那公雞吧, 因為我們根本負擔不起後院
forget the rooster. We ain't had no yard.

158
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
我也明白
I hear you tell it.

159
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,770
Lucille和我以前住在Logan街 [美國, 丹佛]
Me and Lucille was staying down there on Logan street.

160
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,100
我們有兩間房子, 還有個廁所在後院裏
Had two rooms with the outhouse in the back.

161
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,900
我平常都不介意的
I ain't mind the outhouse none.

162
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,440
但當冬天時有陣該死的冷鋒吹過
But when that goddamn wind blew through there in the winter,

163
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,170
我就恨死它了! [以前家裏沒有水管]
that's what I'm talking about!

164
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,940
直至今天, 我還在想
To this day, I wonder why the hell

165
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,450
為何我會住在那裏六年之久
I ever stayed down there for six long years.

166
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,010
我當時也不知道可以怎辦
But, see, I didn't know I could do no better.

167
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,880
我以為只有白人才配有室內廁所什麼的
I thought only white folks had inside toilets and things.

168
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,060
很多人也像這樣
A lot of folks don't think

169
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,820
安於現狀
they can do no better than they're doing now.

170
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,020
那是些要改變的想法
Just something you gotta learn.

171
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,960
就像很多人還去Bella的店買東西
A lot of folks still shop at Bella's.

172
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,760
Bella賣的東西沒問題啊, 她賣的食物也很新鮮
Ain't nothing wrong with Bella's. She got fresh food.

173
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,490
我不是在說她賣的食物有沒有問題
I ain't said nothing about if she got fresh food.

174
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,960
我在說她賣的價錢
I'm talking about what she charge.

175
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,930
同樣的貨品她比A&P賣貴十美分
She charges 10 cents more than the A&P.

176
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,500
A&P沒為我做過什麼
A&P ain't never done nothing for me.

177
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,470
我會選擇消費在我認為對的地方
I spend my money where I'm treated right.

178
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,740
我到Bella的店裏說
I go down to Bella, say,

179
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,240
我要買一條麵包, 星期五付錢, 她就給我了
"i need a loaf of bread, I'll pay you Friday," she gives it to me.

180
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,210
如果我還在
What sense that make when I got money

181
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,810
其他地方消費
to spend it somewhere else

182
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,240
把這個賣人情給我的人忘掉, 我還算什麼?
and ignore the person who done right by me?

183
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,450
聖經裏沒教人忘恩負義
That ain't in the Bible.

184
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,180
我們不是在談論聖經
We ain't talking about what's in the Bible.

185
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,080
明知道她賣貴了, 還在那買東西, 這樣理智嗎?
What sense it make to shop there when she overcharges?

186
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,920
那你去你想去的地方買
Well, you do your shopping where you want to,

187
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,790
我去賣過人情給我的地方買
I do my shopping where people been good to me.

188
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,250
噢, 我只是不認同她賣貴了而已
Oh, I don't think it's right for her to overcharge, that's all.

189
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,790
聽著, 我該走了
Look here, I got to be getting on.

190
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,120
Lucille都要發怒了
Lucille gonna be raising all kind of hell.

191
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,890
朋友, 你要去哪, 我們還沒喝完這瓶呢
Where you going, nigger? We ain't finished this pint.

192
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,160
先喝完吧
Come here finish this pint.

193
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,060
我會留下啊, 如果你請我喝的話
Well, hell, I am, if you ever turn the bottle loose.

194
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,030
我唯一要感謝A&P的地方
Only thing I'll say about the A&P is,

195
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,330
就是他們讓Cory在那工作
I'm glad Cory got that job down there.

196
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,830
幫補一下他的開支
Help him with his school clothes and things.

197
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,870
Gabe搬走了, 我們有點捉襟見肘
Gabe done moved out, things getting tight around here.

198
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,110
他有份工作
He got that job,

199
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,840
至少可以照顧下自己
he can start to look out for himself.

200
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,080
Cory被一間大學的美式足球隊錄取了
Cory done got recruited by a college football team.

201
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,210
我跟他說過大學的美式足球隊到底是怎麼一回事
I told that boy about that college football stuff.

202
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,120
那些白人不會讓他碰美式足球的
The white man ain't gonna let him get nowhere with that football.

203
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,190
他第一次來我就跟他解釋過了
I told him when he first come to me with it.

204
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,990
現在你告訴我他更著迷了
Now, you come telling me he done got more tied up in it.

205
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,090
他該去車行工作
He ought to get recruited in how to fix cars,

206
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,760
還是做點能令他過活的事
or some way he can make a living.

207
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,960
他不是想成為職業美式足球員
He ain't talking about making no living playing football.

208
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,000
那只是他的興趣而已
It's just something the boys in school do.

209
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,520
他們會派負責人員來
They're gonna send a recruiter by

210
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,070
跟你商討, 他會跟你說
to talk to you. He'll tell you.

211
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,200
他不是想成為職業美式足球員
He ain't talking about making no living playing football.

212
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,940
被錄取是個榮譽
It's an honor to be recruited.

213
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,300
他不會走得遠的, Bono就懂
It ain't gonna get him nowhere, Bono'll tell you that.

214
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,870
如果他跟你一樣那麼有運動細胞, 他會成為偉大的球員
If he be like you in sports, he gonna be all right.

215
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,240
這麼久以來只有兩個人打棒球比你好
Ain't but two men ever played baseball good as you.

216
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,310
就是Babe Ruth和Josh Gibson [皆為著名棒球員]
That's Babe Ruth and Josh Gibson.

217
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,850
他們就是唯一比你有更多全壘打的人
Them the only two men ever hit more home runs than you.

218
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,080
打棒球給了我什麼? 我沒有地方上廁所
And what it ever get me? I ain't got a pot to piss in,

219
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,360
又或者靠此買過一間房子
or a window to throw it out of.

220
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,220
時代不同了, Troy
Times have changed since you were playing baseball, Troy.

221
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,290
你打棒球都是戰爭之前了, 很多事情都改變了
That was before the war. Times have changed a lot since then.

222
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,560
有什麼改變了?
How the hell they done changed?

223
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,160
現在很多有色人種都在球隊裏
They got a lot of colored boys playing ball now.

224
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,590
棒球也好, 美式足球也好
Baseball and football.

225
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,900
Ro, 你說對了, 時代不同了, Troy
You right about that, Ro. Times have changed, Troy.

226
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,270
你只是生不逢時而已
You just come along too early.

227
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,000
世上沒有所謂"生不逢時"
There ought not never have been no time called "too early."

228
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,840
以他為例...
Now you take that fellow...

229
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,370
那個以前在洋基隊
What's that fellow they had playing

230
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,640
當右外野手的叫什麼?
right field back then for the Yankees?

231
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,580
Bono, 你該記得的
You remember who I'm talking about, Bono,

232
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,930
在洋基隊當右外野手的那個
played right field for the Yankees.

233
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,310
- Selkirk?    對, 就是他 [George Selkirk]
- Selkirk?   - Yeah, Selkirk, that's it!

234
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,920
他的職業生涯打擊率是.269, 你看得出了嗎?
Man's batting 269, you understand? 269!

235
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,590
那合理嗎? 我的打擊率是.432, 有37個是全壘打
What sense that make? I'm batting 432 with 37 home runs!

236
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,860
他的打擊率才.269, 卻在洋基隊裏當右外野手!
He's batting 269, playing right field for the Yankees!

237
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,990
我昨天看到Josh Gibson的女兒
I saw Josh Gibson's daughter yesterday.

238
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,630
她穿著破爛的鞋到處跑
She's running around with raggedy shoes on her feet.

239
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,230
我敢打賭Selkirk的女兒
I bet you Selkirk's daughter ain't running around

240
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,160
可不是穿著什麼破爛的到處走
with no raggedy shoes on her feet. I bet you that.

241
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,100
現在很多職業棒球員都是有色人種了
They got a lot of colored baseball players now.

242
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,240
Jackie Robinson是第一個
Jackie Robinson was the first.

243
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,270
Jackie Robinson都是名星了
Folks had to wait for Jackie Robinson.

244
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,170
我看過無數比Jackie Robinson還會打棒球的黑人
I done seen 100 niggers play baseball better than Jackie Robinson.

245
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,180
我甚至看過Jackie Robinson都進不了的球隊
Hell, I seen some teams Jackie Robinson couldn't even make!

246
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,410
還說什麼Jackie Robinson?
What you talking about, Jackie Robinson?

247
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,250
Jackie Robinson只是個無名小卒而已!
Jackie Robinson wasn't nobody!

248
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,910
我要說的是如果你會打球
I'm talking about if you could play ball,

249
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,180
他們就該給你機會
then they ought to let you play.

250
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,350
而不是在意你的膚色人種
Don't matter what color you are.

251
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,180
還說我生不逢時
Come telling me I come along too early.

252
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,390
如果你會打球, 他們就該給你機會
If you can play, then they ought to let you play.

253
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,020
你再繼續這麼喝會死的
You gonna drink yourself to death.

254
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,060
不用喝那麼多吧
You don't need to be drinking like that.

255
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,290
噢, 死神而已, 我都見過了
Oh! Death ain't nothing. I done seen him,

256
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,330
還跟他搏鬥過, 不用你來跟我說
I done wrestled with him. You can't tell me nothing about death.

257
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,930
死神不過是個外角的快速球
Death ain't nothing but a fastball on the outside corner,

258
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,900
而你知道我有什麼能耐
and you know what I do with that.

259
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,670
Bono, 看這裏, 我有在說謊嗎?
Look here, Bono, am I lying?

260
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,640
你扔個到腰水平高度的快速球
You get one of them fastballs about waist high

261
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,240
從外角扔過來
on the outside corner of the plate

262
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,110
那簡直易如反掌
where you can get the meat of the bat on it,

263
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,350
老天啊, 我會把它打到出場外
and, good god, you could kiss it good-bye.

264
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,420
- 我在吹噓嗎?    - 不, 你在說事實
- Am I lying?   - No, you telling the truth.

265
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,590
我親眼看見過
I seen you do it.

266
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,090
如果我在吹牛, 那會是天大的謊話
If I'm lying, that's 450 feet worth of lying.

267
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,260
死神來我來說就是這麼回事
That's all death is to me.

268
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,930
一個從外角扔來的快速球
A fastball on the outside corner.

269
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,190
我不知道你為何說起死亡了?
I don't know why you want to get on talking about death?

270
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,430
說說又沒有問題
Ain't nothing wrong with talking about death.

271
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,330
那是生命的一部分啊, 每個人都必經
That's a part of life! Everybody gonna die.

272
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,930
你會死, 我會死
You gonna die. I'm gonna die.

273
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,670
Bono會死, 天啊, 所有人都會死
Bono gonna die. Hell, we all gonna die.

274
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,000
但你也沒必要繼續說吧
But you ain't got to talk about it.

275
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,140
我不喜歡說這種事
I don't like talking about it.

276
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,300
那是你提起的
Well, you the one brought it up.

277
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,110
Bono和我剛才在說棒球
Me and Bono talking about baseball.

278
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,140
你突然說我會喝死
You come telling me I'm gonna drink myself to death.

279
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,110
不是嗎, Bono?
Ain't that right, Bono?

280
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,710
你知道我一周只有一晚去喝酒
Now you know I drink just but one night out the week,

281
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,680
那是星期五晚
that's Friday night.

282
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,950
我不會喝多
I drink just enough to where I can handle it.

283
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,920
然後我就會離開, 不碰它了
Then I leaves it alone. I cuts it loose.

284
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,420
所以你不必擔心我會喝死
So, you ain't got to worry about me drinking myself to death

285
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,190
因為我不害怕死亡
'cause I ain't worrying about death.

286
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,020
我見過他, 跟他搏鬥過
I done seen him, done wrestled with him.

287
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,190
跟你說, Bono
Look here, Bono.

288
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,430
我有天看到死神舉軍衝向我
I look up one day, and death is marching straight at me,

289
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,700
像是閱兵時的士軍隊一樣
like soldiers on parade.

290
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,200
當時死神大軍在衝向我
The army of death was marching straight at me.

291
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,470
當時是1941年7月中
It was the middle of July, 1941.

292
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,040
然而卻像冬天一般冷
And it got real cold, just like it be winter.

293
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,470
那時候死神他啊
And it seemed like death, himself,

294
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,710
好像舉手碰了我肩膀一下
reached out and touched me on the shoulder.

295
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:26,180
他像我現在碰你一樣, 我感受到那寒意
He touched me like I touch you now. I got cold as ice.

296
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,380
死神就站在那裏, 對我露出不友善的笑容
Death standing there, grinning at me.

297
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,250
Troy, 別說了
Troy, why don't you hush that talk.

298
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,480
我說: 死神先生, 你想要什麼? 要帶走我嗎?
I said, "what you want, Mr. death? You be wanting me?

299
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,450
你不再派你的小卒來了嗎?
"You done sent your army to be getting me?"

300
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,240
我直直的看著他
I looked him dead in the eye.

301
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,460
我什麼都不怕
I wasn't fearing nothing.

302
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,460
我準備跟他鬥個你死我活, 直至現在我都是!
I was ready to tangle, just like I'm ready to tangle now!

303
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,760
聖經說要經常警惕
Bible says be ever vigilant.

304
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,200
所以我不會喝醉, 我還要耳聽八方
So, I don't get but so drunk. I got to keep watch.

305
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,000
Troy當時進了慈善醫院
Troy was right down there at mercy hospital.

306
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:46,970
你記得他那次得了肺炎
You remember he had that pneumonia,

307
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,300
還有發燒, 躺在床上還說些有的沒的
laying there with a fever, talking plumb out his head.

308
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,540
當時死神站在那盯著我
And death standing there, staring at me,

309
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,200
手握著鐮刀
carrying that sickle in his hand.

310
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:58,110
終於, 他說: 你想再活多一年嗎?
Finally, he say, "you want to be bound over for another year?"

311
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,280
他這樣說
Just like that. He say,

312
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,220
你想再活多一年嗎?
"you want to be bound over for another year?"

313
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,250
我說: 去你的, 我們現在就說清楚
I said, "bound over, hell! We can settle this right now."

314
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,290
他聽了後退後了點
He kinda fell back when I said that.

315
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,760
我即時龍精虎猛
And all the cold went out of me.

316
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,090
我伸手搶去他的鐮刀
I reached down, I grabbed that sickle.

317
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,560
我用盡力氣扔走它
I threw it as far as I could throw it,

318
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,400
然後我們開始埋身肉搏
and me and him commenced to wrestling.

319
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,130
我們打了...六...三天三夜
We wrestled for... Carry the six... Three days and three nights!

320
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,400
我不知道從哪兒來的力量
Now, I don't know where I got the strength from,

321
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,270
因為他處於優勢時
'cause every time he tried to get the best of me,

322
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:28,070
我重新振作
I reached way deep down inside myself,

323
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,410
並又得到對抗他的力量
found the strength to do him one better.

324
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,210
Troy每次說起這事
Every time Troy tells that story,

325
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,410
都有不同的版本
he find different ways to tell it,

326
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,110
不同的謊話
different things to make up.

327
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,450
我沒有胡說, 女人
I ain't making up nothing, woman.

328
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,220
我在說實話
I'm telling you the facts of what happened.

329
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,450
我跟死神搏鬥了三天三夜
I wrestled with death for three days and three nights,

330
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,190
而現在還能站著跟你說話
and I'm standing here to tell you about it.

331
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,320
繼續, 在最後
All right. At the end of the third night,

332
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,430
我們都脆弱得站不起來了
we done weakened each other to where we can't even hardly move.

333
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,400
死神突然站起來
Death stood up.

334
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,800
他披上那連帽的白色袍子
He threw on that robe, had a white robe with a hood on it.

335
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,270
他披上後便去尋找他的鐮刀
He throwed on that robe and ent off to look for that sickle.

336
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:00,140
他說: 我會回來的, 像這樣
He said, "I'll be back." Just like that. "I'll be back."

337
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,280
我說: 是嗎? 那你得好好找我
I said, "yeah? Well, you gonna have to find me!"

338
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,410
我又不是傻子
I wasn't no fool.

339
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,410
我不會自找麻煩的
I wasn't going looking for him.

340
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,850
我知道死亡不是拿來開玩笑的事, 他早晚會找上我
I know death ain't nothing to play
with. And I know he's gonna get me.

341
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,150
我知道我早晚要加入他的大軍
I know I got to join his army, his camp followers.

342
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,150
但我一天還有力氣
But as long as I keep up my strength and see him coming,

343
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,420
還能保持警覺
as long as I keep up my vigilance,

344
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,120
他就得打上一場硬仗
he gonna have to fight to get me.

345
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,360
我不會輕易讓他帶走我
I ain't going easy.

346
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,400
那你看, 既然你要保持警覺
Well, look here, since you got to keep up your vigilance,

347
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
讓我替你拿著那酒瓶
let me have the bottle.

348
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,870
該死的, 我不應該告訴你那部分
Hell, I shouldn't have told you that part.

349
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,320
我應該刪掉那部分
I should have left out that part.

350
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,210
Troy一直都說這些話
Troy be talking all that stuff.

351
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,240
然而有一半時候他根本不知道自己在說什麼
Half the time, he don't even know what he be talking about!

352
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,270
- Bono會瞭解的   - 對, 我很瞭解你
- Yeah, Bono know me better than that.
- That's right, I know you.

353
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,440
我知道你就像Uncle Remus一樣 [說故事的人]
I know you got some Uncle Remus in your blood.

354
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,850
你有的故事比魔鬼擁有的罪人還多
You got more stories than the devil got sinners.

355
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,480
天啊, 我也跟他說過話
Oh, hell, I done seen him, too. Done talked to the devil.

356
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,520
沒人想知道
Nobody wants to be hearing that stuff!

357
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,320
嗨, 爸
Hey, pop.

358
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,890
你來這裏做什麼?
What you come "hey, poppin'" me for?

359
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,190
你好嗎, Rose?
How you doing, Rose?

360
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,560
Bono先生, 你好嗎?
Mr. Bono, how you doing?

361
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,430
嗨, Lyons, 你呢?
Hey, Lyons, how you been?

362
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,870
他一定過得很好
He must've been doing all right.

363
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,100
他整周都沒來找過我
I ain't seen him around here last week.

364
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,900
Troy, 放過你的兒子吧, 他特地來看你
Troy, leave your boy alone. He come by to see you

365
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,470
而你卻又想胡說
and you want to start all that nonsense.

366
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,900
我沒有說Lyons什麼, 來喝口
I ain't bothering Lyons. Here, get you a drink.

367
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,880
我們知道原因
Me and him got an understanding.

368
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,610
我知道他為何來, 而他也知道
I know why he come by to see me, and he know I know.

369
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,580
爸, 別這樣說, 我只是來見你一下
Come on, pop. I just stopped by to say hi,

370
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,550
看看你過得怎樣了
see how you was doing.

371
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,910
- 但你昨天沒來啊   - Lyons, 你留下來吃晚飯嗎?
- You ain't stopped by yesterday.
- You staying for supper, Lyons?

372
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:15,890
我在煮雞肉
I got some chicken cooking in the oven.

373
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,220
不了, Rose, 謝謝, 我剛巧經過這裏而已
No, Rose, thanks. I just was in the neighborhood

374
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,550
想著進來看你們一下
and thought I'd stop by for a minute.

375
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,220
得了吧, 你剛巧經過這
Yeah, you was in the neighborhood all right.

376
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,190
老兄, 你還真會說話
Nigger, you telling the truth there.

377
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,360
你剛巧經過這因為我今天發薪
You was in the neighborhood 'cause it's my payday.

378
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,660
既然你提到了, 給我$10
Well, hell, since you mentioned it, let me have $10.

379
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,500
該死的, 我寧願下地獄
I'll be damned. I'll die and go to hell

380
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,230
和魔鬼玩牌也不會給你
and play Blackjack with the devil before I give you $10.

381
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:36,200
我想知道你看見過的魔鬼
That's what I want to know about, that devil you done seen.

382
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,370
爸看見過魔鬼? 真會吹牛
Pop done seen the devil? You too much, pop.

383
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,540
- 對, 我見過   - 他才沒有
- Yeah, I done seen him. - He ain't seen no devil.

384
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,670
我跟他說過那男人不是魔鬼
I told him that man ain't had nothing to do with the devil.

385
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,940
他把任何他不明白的事, 都稱呼為魔鬼
Anything he can't understand, he want to call it the devil.

386
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,350
看這, Bono, 我去Hertzberger的店買些傢俱
Look here, Bono. I go by Hertzberger's to get some furniture.

387
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,250
收音機說三房寓所只售$298
You got three rooms for $298. That what it say on the radio.

388
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,520
三房寓所只售$298, 他還為此創作了首歌
"Three rooms, $298." He made up a little song about it.

389
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,590
我去到那, 他說我不能貸款
I get down there, man tell me I can't get no credit.

390
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,960
我每天都工作, 還不能貸款
I'm working every day, can't get no credit.

391
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,930
那怎辦?
What to do?

392
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,960
我只有些破爛的傢俱
I got an empty house with some raggedy furniture.

393
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,930
Cory沒有床
Cory ain't got no bed.

394
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,400
他在地上鋪點破布就睡了
He's sleeping on a pile of rags on the floor.

395
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,500
每天都工作, 卻不能貸款
Working every day, can't get no credit.

396
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,970
我回來後, Rose也看到的
I come back here, Rose'll tell you,

397
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,770
我非常憤怒, 想著有什麼能做
madder than hell, trying to figure out what to do.

398
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,270
有人來敲門
Come a knock on the door.

399
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,540
我才住在這裏三天, 有誰知道我在這?
I ain't been living but three days, who know I'm here?

400
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,680
我去應門, 原來是魔鬼
I open the door. Devil standing there.

401
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,650
一個大個子
Bigger than life.

402
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,710
一個白人, 穿著得體
White fella, got on good clothes and everything.

403
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,250
手裏拿著塊剪貼板
Standing there with a clipboard in his hand.

404
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,240
我還沒說什麼
Now, I ain't got to say nothing.

405
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,450
他就說了:
First words come out of his mouth,

406
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,750
我知道你需要點傢俱而你不能貸款
I understand you need some furniture and can't get no credit.

407
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,490
我都要暈倒了, 他說: 我會讓你貸款
I liked to fell over.
He said, "I'll give you all the credit you want,

408
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,530
但你需要付利息
"but you gonna have to pay the interest on it."

409
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,260
我跟他說要是他給我那間寓所
Now, I told him, he give me them three rooms,

410
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,600
多少都行
he can charge whatever he want.

411
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,430
有輛貨車第二天來了
Next day, a truck pull up here,

412
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,230
兩個男人給那三間房間佈置了傢俱
two men unload them three rooms.

413
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,430
駕車的那位給了我本書
Man what drove the truck give me a book.

414
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,970
跟我說每月初, 寄$10到書上這個地址
Said first of the month, send $10 to the address in the book,

415
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,240
那就可以了
everything'll be fine.

416
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,270
說如果你沒付
Said if you miss a payment,

417
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,440
魔鬼會來找你, 而你需要付上更多
the devil was coming back, and there'll be hell to pay.

418
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,010
那是15年前的事
That was 15 years ago.

419
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,620
直至今天, 每月初, 我都寄$10
To this day, first day of every month, I send my $10,

420
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,280
非常準時, Rose可以擔保
just like clockwork. Rose'll tell you.

421
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,520
Troy在說謊
Troy lying.

422
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,250
我從此沒再見過那人
I ain't never seen that man since.

423
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,990
你說如果他不是魔鬼會是誰?
Now, you tell me, who else that gonna be but the devil?

424
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,320
而我沒有賣掉靈魂什麼的
And I ain't sold my soul or nothing like that.

425
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,790
我不會跟坐著貨車來的魔鬼交易
No, I wouldn't have, truck with the devil over nothing like that.

426
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:11,600
但我卻換來所有傢俱, 所以我準時寄我的十塊
But I got my furniture. And I send my $10, just like clockwork.

427
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,570
你都付多久了?
How long you say you been paying this $10 a month?

428
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,540
15年
15 years.

429
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,500
天啊, 那你不是一早付清了嗎?
Hell, ain't you finished paying for it yet?

430
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,500
那人要你付多少?
How much the man done charge you?

431
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,040
是啊, 我一早付清了
Oh, hell, I done paid for it.

432
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,710
早就付清了
I done paid for it 10 times over.

433
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,310
事實是, 我怕我不繼續付要承擔後果
Fact is, I'm scared to stop paying.

434
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,650
別聽Troy說的, 傢俱是在Glickman先生的店買的
Troy lying. We got that furniture from Mr. Glickman.

435
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,510
他沒有每月給誰十塊
He ain't paying no $10 a month to nobody.

436
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,750
天啊, 女人, Bono知道我不是傻的
Hell, woman, Bono know I ain't that big a fool.

437
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,350
我還想說
I was just getting ready to say,

438
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,520
我知道有個橋下賣便宜的傢俱
I know where there's a bridge for sale.

439
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,490
我告訴你
I'll tell you this.

440
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,520
那人是不是魔鬼不重要
It don't matter to me if it was the devil.

441
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,790
他有沒有給我貸款也不重要
It don't matter if the devil give credit.

442
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,790
- 總有人要給我吧    - 那很重要
- Somebody got to give it.   - It ought to matter.

443
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,360
你到處說你跟魔鬼交易了
You walking around here saying you gonna make truck with the devil,

444
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,700
你將來得跟上帝解釋清楚
god's the one you're gonna have to answer to.

445
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,500
祂會作出審判
He's the one gonna be at the judgment.

446
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
聽著, 爸, 給我十塊
Yeah, well, look here, pop, let me have that $10.

447
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,600
我會還你的
I'll give it back to you.

448
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,300
Bonnie在醫院找到工作了
Bonnie got a job working at the hospital.

449
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,270
Bono, 我怎跟你說的?
Bono, what did I tell you?

450
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,040
只有這老兄有事相求時我才會見到他
Only time I see this nigger is when he want something.

451
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,310
只有那種時候
That's the only time I see him.

452
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,780
別說這, 爸, Bono先生不想聽這個
Come on, pop, Mr. Bono don't want to hear all that.

453
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,380
給我十塊, 我說過Bonnie找到工作了吧
Let me have the $10. I told you, Bonnie's working!

454
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,150
她找到工作又如何了?
What that mean to me if Bonnie's working?

455
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,750
我不在乎, 要是她在工作, 你就去問她拿十塊
I don't care if she working. Go ask her for $10 if she's working.

456
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,620
還說她在工作, 那你為何不工作?
Talking about Bonnie working. Why ain't you working?

457
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,850
爸, 你知道我不能找到正當工作
Ah, pop, you know I can't find no decent job.

458
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,320
我去哪找? 你知道我的過去
Where am I gonna get a job at? You know I can't get no job.

459
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,530
我說過, 我認識一些人
I told you, I know some people down there.

460
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,490
如果你想, 我可以讓你來清理垃圾
I can get you on the rubbish if you want to work.

461
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,400
你上次有事相求時我就跟你說了
I told you that last time you come back here asking for something.

462
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,630
不了, 爸, 謝謝, 那不適合我
No, pop, thanks, that ain't for me.

463
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,400
我不想替人清理垃圾
I don't want to be carrying nobody's rubbish.

464
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,100
我不想做這些千篇一律的工作
I don't want to be punching nobody's time clock.

465
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,400
怎麼了? 清理垃圾配不起你嗎?
What's the matter? You too good to carry people's rubbish?

466
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,340
你以為那十塊是哪裏來的?
Where you think that $10 you talking about comes from?

467
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,070
我就要去清理垃圾, 然後我賺的就給你
I'm just supposed to haul people's rubbish

468
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,840
就因為你太懶惰?
and give my money to you 'cause you too lazy to work?

469
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,340
你不去工作
You're too lazy to work

470
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,810
然後想知道你為何沒錢
and want to know why you ain't got what I got.

471
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,610
Bonnie在哪間醫院工作? 慈善醫院?
What hospital Bonnie working at, Mercy?

472
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,520
她在Passavant醫院裏的洗衣房工作 [匹茲堡醫療中心大學]
She down at Passavant, working in the laundry.

473
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,420
我不能給你, 我給了你十塊
I ain't got nothing as it is. I give you $10,

474
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,750
那我接下來一星期都吃豆嗎?
I got to eat beans the rest of the week?

475
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,420
不, 你不會拿到那十塊
No, you ain't getting no $10 over here.

476
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,820
不至於吃豆吧
You ain't got to be eating no beans.

477
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,360
真不知道你為何能說出這?
I don't know why you want to say that?

478
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,960
我沒有多餘的錢!
I ain't got no extra money!

479
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,830
Gabe搬走了
Gabe done moved out,

480
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,660
錢都替Pearl小姐交房租了
giving his money over there to Miss Pearl, paying her rent.

481
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,640
我們都捉襟見肘了
Things done got tight around here.

482
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,570
我再也不能承擔每次發薪金也給你
I can't afford to be giving you every payday.

483
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,770
我不是想你給我
I ain't asked you to give me nothing.

484
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,140
我是想你借給我
I asked you to loan me $10.

485
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,440
我知道你有十塊的
I know you got $10.

486
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,610
我是有啊, 你知道為何嗎?
Yeah, I got it. You know why I got it?

487
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,840
因為我到處亂花錢
'Cause I don't throw my money away on them streets.

488
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,880
你想過得快活, 當個音樂家
You want to live the fast life, being a musician,

489
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,710
有錢在俱樂部流連
running around in them clubs and things,

490
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,450
那就學懂照顧自己
then learn to take care of yourself.

491
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,580
你不會看到我請求別人幫忙
You ain't gone find me asking nobody for nothing!

492
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,820
這麼都年來都沒有
I spent too many years without.

493
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,850
你和我不同
Hey, you and me is two different people.

494
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,720
我吸取了教訓, 知道該做什麼
I done learned my mistake and I learned to do what's right by it.

495
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,590
你還想不勞而獲
You still trying to get something for nothing.

496
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,560
沒人欠你什麼
Life don't owe you nothing.

497
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,500
是你欠自己的, 問問Bono, 他也懂
You owe it to yourself. Ask Bono. He'll tell you I'm right.

498
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,870
我們有各自生活的方式
You got your way of dealing with the world, I got mine.

499
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,800
我唯一在乎的是音樂
Only thing that matters to me is the music.

500
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,400
看得出來, 你吃什麼不重要
Yeah, I can see that. Don't matter how you gonna eat,

501
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,700
哪來錢也不重要
don't matter where your next dollar coming from.

502
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,410
你說得真對
Yeah, you telling the truth there.

503
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,640
我知道我要吃飯, 但我也要生活
I know I got to eat. But I got to live, too.

504
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,810
我需要點什麼讓我每天有動力
I need something that's gonna help me get out of bed in the morning,

505
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,610
讓我感覺到我還存在
make me feel like I belong in the world.

506
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,490
我不打擾誰
I don't bother nobody.

507
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,390
我只是玩音樂而已
I just stay with my music

508
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,720
因為那是我生存於世的理由
'cause that's the only way I can find to live in the world.

509
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,520
不給就算了, 別跟我說要做什麼
Otherwise, ain't no telling what I might do.

510
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,620
我不是來批評你和你的生活方式
I don't come by criticizing you and how you live.

511
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,560
是讓你借十塊給我
I just come by to ask you for $10.

512
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,630
我不想聽你說教
I don't want to hear all that about how I live.

513
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,160
天啊, 你母親把你養得真好
Boy, your mama did a hell of a job raising you.

514
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,870
爸, 你改變不了我的, 我已經34歲了
You can't change me, pop. I'm 34 years old.

515
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,130
如果你想改變我
If you wanted to change me,

516
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,770
或許你該在我成長時陪伴左右
you should have been there when I was growing up.

517
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,640
我來看你, 向你借十塊
I come by to see you, ask you for $10,

518
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,540
而你卻跟我說我是如何被養育成人?
and you want to talk about how I was raised?

519
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,950
你根本不知道是怎麼一回事
You don't know nothing about how I was raised.

520
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,920
給他十塊吧, Troy
Let the boy have $10, Troy.

521
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,230
你在看什麼? 你知道我沒有錢的
Hell you looking at? You know I ain't got no money.

522
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,200
你知道我把錢放在哪
You know what I do with my money.

523
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,000
給他吧, 如果你想的話
Go on, give him $10 if you want him to have it.

524
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,600
我會, 當你交給我的時候
I will, soon as you turn it loose.

525
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,470
這裏
There it is.

526
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,610
$76.22
Seventy six dollars and twenty-two cents.

527
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,810
看到了嗎, Bono? 我只能拿回$6
You see this, Bono? I ain't gonna get but six of that back.

528
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,980
夠了吧, 拿著, Lyons
He ought to stop telling that lie. Here, Lyons.

529
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,520
謝謝, Rose
Thanks, Rose.

530
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,990
我要走了, 下次見
Look, I got to run. I'll see you all later.

531
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,490
等下, 你會說"謝謝, Rose"
Wait a minute. You gonna say, "thanks, Rose,"

532
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,260
但你不感謝付出的那個
but you ain't gonna look to see where she got that money from.

533
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,560
你看到他們怎對待我嗎, Bono?
You see how they do me, Bono?

534
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,560
我知道是你的錢, 爸
I know she got it from you, pop.

535
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,120
謝謝, 我會還的
Thanks. I'll give it back to you.

536
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,100
看, 又撒謊了
There you go, telling another lie.

537
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,230
你還我$10時, 你還欠著$30呢
Time I see that $10, you'll be owing me $30 more.

538
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,070
- 再見, Bono先生   - 保重, Lyons
- See you, Mr. Bono.    - Take care, Lyons.

539
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,770
爸, 謝謝, 下次見
Thanks, pop. I'll see you again.

540
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,810
真不知道為何他不去工作
I don't know why that boy don't go and get him a decent job

541
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,780
然後照顧他的女人
and take care of that woman he got.

542
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,850
他會找的, Troy, 那孩子還小
He'll be all right, Troy. The boy is still young!

543
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,690
那孩子34歲了
The boy is 34 years old.

544
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,720
別又開始說了
Let's not get off into all that.

545
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,720
我要走了, Lucille在等著我
Look here, I got to go. I got to be going. Lucille gonna be waiting.

546
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,020
看到這女人了嗎, Bono?
See this woman, Bono?

547
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,860
我愛她
I love this woman.

548
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,530
我愛得都有點痛了
I love her so much, it hurts.

549
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:41,600
我太愛她, 我都找不到方式表達了
I love her so much, I done run out of ways of loving her,

550
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,900
所以我要用回最簡單的
so, I got to get back to basics.

551
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,740
你星期一早上別來
Don't you come by my house Monday morning,

552
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:46,710
跟我說要上班了
talking about time to go to work.

553
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,040
- 因為我還撫摸她   - 夠了, Troy
- 'Cause I'm gonna still be stroking.   - Troy, stop!

554
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,880
我也不在意, Rose
I ain't paying him no mind, Rose.

555
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,640
他只是醉了
That ain't nothing but gin talk.

556
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,750
即管吧, Troy! 星期一見
Go on, Troy! I'll see you Monday.

557
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,020
你別來, 朋友
老Don't you come by my house, nigger!

558
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,920
我跟你說過我到時候在做什麼
I done told you what I'm gonna be doing!

559
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,560
星期二才來
Come back on Tuesday!

560
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,930
早安
Good morning.

561
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,970
我可以給你煮早餐, 你要吃嗎?
You ready for breakfast? I can fix you some

562
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,370
在我掛起衣服後
soon as I finish hanging up these clothes.

563
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,340
我喝咖啡就行了
I got the coffee on. That's all right.

564
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,010
來點這個就行了
I just have some of that this morning.

565
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,680
昨天的彩票有結果了
That 651 hit yesterday.

566
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,620
Pearl小姐今個月第二次中了$1
That's the second time this month Miss Pearl hit for a dollar.

567
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,880
看來那些不需要的人總得到更多
Seems like those that need the least always get lucky.

568
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,440
貧窮的人反倒什麼也沒有
Poor folks can't get nothing.

569
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,020
數字又不認人的
Them numbers don't know nobody.

570
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,820
我不知道為你和Lyons都玩這個
I don't know why you fool with 'em, you and Lyons both.

571
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,360
用來消閒
Oh, it's something to do.

572
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,830
你只不過在輸錢而已
You ain't doing nothing but throwing your money away.

573
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,360
Troy, 你知道我能控制自己
Troy, you know I don't play foolishly.

574
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,000
我就這裏五分, 那裏五分的玩
I just play a nickel here and a nickel there.

575
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,730
那你就花了一毛了
That's two nickels you done throwed away.

576
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:22,370
不全是, 我有時候會贏, 那就扯平了
Nah, I hit sometimes. That makes up for it.

577
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,140
贏了的話, 早晚會用到
Always comes in handy when I do hit.

578
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,940
贏的時候也不聽見你抱怨
I don't hear you complaining then.

579
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,110
我不是在抱怨, 我只是說這很愚蠢
I ain't complaining now. I just say it's foolish,

580
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,840
試著在六百種組合中
trying to guess out of 600 ways

581
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,410
猜出正確號碼
which way the number gonna come.

582
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,040
如果我拿到這些黑人的...
If I had all the money these niggers...

583
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:39,750
非藉美國人一周放在上面的錢
You negroes throw away on numbers in one week,

584
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,720
只一星期, 我就會很有錢
just one week, I'd be a rich man.

585
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,060
你在這裏說如果和認為是件蠢事
You wishing and calling it foolish

586
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,860
那些人也不會停下不玩
ain't gonna stop folks from playing the numbers.

587
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,960
我肯定
That's one thing for sure.

588
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,100
再者, 玩彩票也有好處的
Besides, some good things come from playing numbers.

589
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,400
看看Pope玩彩票
Look where Pope done bought him

590
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,130
讓他賺了一間餐廳
that restaurant off of numbers.

591
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,800
我不能接受這種人
I can't stand niggers like that.

592
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,970
以前他沒多少錢
Man ain't had two dimes to rub together.

593
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,810
穿著那雙破鞋漫目無的地走
He running around with his shoes all run-over,

594
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,880
到處問人拿香煙
bumming money for cigarettes.

595
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,880
好了, 中獎了
All right. Got lucky there, hit the numbers...

596
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,180
Troy, 我也知道
Troy, I know all about it.

597
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,750
我會說他很有理智
Had good sense. I'll say that for him.

598
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,720
沒把錢花光
Man ain't throw his money away.

599
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:15,020
我看過有人四天內用掉$2000
I done see niggers go through $2,000 in four days.

600
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,760
他建了間餐廳
Man built him that restaurant down there.

601
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,120
看上去棒極了
Fix it up real nice, too.

602
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,090
然後他不讓有些人進去
Then he won't let nobody come in it.

603
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,730
他們不服務黑人
Negro go in there, can't get no kind of service.

604
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:26,960
看到有個白人進去點了燉肉湯
Seen a white fella go in there, he orders a bowl of stew.

605
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,200
Pope從大鍋裏為他放了很多肉
Pope pick all the meat out of the pot for him.

606
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
那白人的燉肉湯都是肉
Man ain't had nothing but a bowl of meat!

607
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,900
黑人進去點同樣的
Negro go in there behind him,

608
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,940
只會換來馬鈴薯和蘿蔔
he ain't got nothing but the potatoes and the carrots.

609
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,080
還說玩彩票能得到什麼
Talking about what numbers do for people.

610
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,480
你舉了個壞的例子
You picked the wrong example there.

611
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,780
那只讓他成為一個更傻的傻子
Ain't done nothing but made a worser fool out of him

612
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,710
比以前傻得多了
than he already was before.

613
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,780
Troy.
Troy.

614
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,050
你別再擔心
You ought to stop worrying about

615
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,990
昨天工作時發生的事了
what happened at work yesterday.

616
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,720
我沒在擔心
I ain't worried.

617
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,160
他們只是叫我到理事長的辦公室裏
Just called me down there, the commissioner's office,

618
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,030
所有人都覺得我要被炒了
everybody's worried about them firing me.

619
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,970
我不擔心
I ain't worrying about them firing me.

620
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,170
你也別擔心了
You ain't got to worry about that.

621
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,340
Cory在家嗎?
Where's Cory? Cory in the house?

622
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:12,040
- Cory!    - 他出去了
- Cory!   - He gone out.

623
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,950
出去了是吧? 他出去
Out, huh? Yeah, he going out

624
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,950
是因為知道我想他築起那藩籬
'cause he know I want him to work on this fence.

625
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,950
我知道他害怕工作
I know how he is. That boy is scared of working.

626
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,150
他這輩子都沒工作過
He ain't done a lick of work in his life.

627
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,850
他要去練習美式足球
He had to go to football practice.

628
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,960
教練想在賽季開始前
Coach wanted them to get in a little extra practice

629
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,160
多加練習
before the season start.

630
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,990
是啊, 我知道他在做怎樣
Oh, yeah, I got his practice all right.

631
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,260
還沒完成家務就出去
Running out of here before he gets his chores done.

632
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,060
Troy, 你怎麼了?
Troy, what is wrong with you this morning?

633
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,030
什麼事不合你意
Don't nothing set right with you.

634
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,800
回去睡足夠才起來
Go on back in there, go to bed, and get up on the other side.

635
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,410
怎麼是我有問題?
Why something got
to be wrong with me?

636
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,240
我沒說我有什麼問題
I ain't said nothing wrong with me.

637
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,290
你對每件事都有意見
Well, you got something to say about everything.

638
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,540
首先是彩票, 然後是那男人
First, it's the numbers, then it's the way the man

639
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,510
如何運作他的餐廳, 然後是Cory的事
run his restaurant, then you done got on Cory.

640
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,110
下一樣會是什麼?
What's it gonna be next?

641
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,240
抬頭看看天氣合不合你意
Take a look up there, see if the weather suit you.

642
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,180
又或者抱怨你要在這
Or is it gonna be how you gonna put up this fence

643
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,250
掛滿衣服的院子裏築起藩籬?
with the clothes hanging in the yard?

644
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,020
你說對了
You hit the nail on the head then.

645
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,120
當然, 我這麼瞭解你
I know you like I know the back of my hand.

646
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,090
進來再喝杯咖啡
Come on in here and get you some more coffee,

647
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,850
看看能不能讓你正常點
see if that don't straighten you up.

648
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,360
因為你今早很不對勁
'Cause you ain't right this morning.

649
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:49,010
是Troy, 嗨
There's Troy. Hey, Troy.

650
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,210
嗨, Gabe
Hey, Gabe.

651
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,050
- 嗨, Rose   - 嗨, Gabe
- Hey, Rose.   - Hey, Gabe.

652
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,580
你拿著什麼?
What you got there?

653
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:02,350
你想知道嗎, Rose? 我有水果和蔬菜
You know what I got, Rose? I got fruits and vegetables.

654
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,290
你答應過給我的李子呢?
Where them plums you talking about?

655
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:08,090
我今天沒有李子, 我剛才正唱著關於那個
I ain't got no plums today. I was just singing that.

656
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:11,930
我明天會帶來, 我訂了很多李子
I'll have some tomorrow. I put me in a big order for plums.

657
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:17,100
多到夠分給聖彼得和所有人
I'll have enough plums tomorrow for Saint Peter and everybody!

658
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,270
Troy在生我的氣
Troy mad at me.

659
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,070
Gabe, 我沒有, 為何我要生氣?
I ain't mad at you, Gabe. What I got to be mad at you about?

660
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,050
你又沒對我做什麼
You ain't done nothing to me.

661
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,650
我只是搬到了Pearl小姐那裏
I just move over to Miss Pearl's to keep out from in your way.

662
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,080
我沒什麼打算
I ain't mean no harm by it.

663
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,620
誰說你有?
Who said anything about that?

664
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,220
我可沒有說什麼
I ain't said nothing about that.

665
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,120
你不生我的氣嗎?
You ain't mad at me, is you?

666
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,920
我沒有, 如果我有, 你會知道的
I ain't made at you, Gabe.
If I was mad at you, I'd tell you about it.

667
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:42,260
進來吧
Come on, get on out of the street. Come on.

668
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,030
我在地下室裏有兩間房, 我擁有自己的門
I got me two rooms in the basement. I got my own door, too.

669
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,440
你想看我的鑰匙嗎?
You want to seemy key?

670
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:57,910
那是我的鑰匙, 沒有人有同一樣的
That's my own key. Ain't nobody else got a key like that.

671
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,640
那就是我兩間房間的鑰匙
That's my key for my two rooms.

672
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,680
很好, 你有一把屬於你的鑰匙
That's good, Gabe. Got your own key, that's good.

673
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,650
你餓嗎?
You hungry, Gabe?

674
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,680
我剛在給Troy煮早餐
I was just fixing to cook Troy some breakfast.

675
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,050
我吃點餅乾就好了
I'll take some biscuits.

676
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,390
你有餅幹嗎?
Ooh, you got some biscuits?

677
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,260
你知道我在天堂時
Did you know, when I was in heaven,

678
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,260
我和聖彼得每早
every morning, me and Saint Peter

679
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,230
都會坐在門口, 吃點餅幹嗎?
would sit down by the gate and eat some big, fat biscuits?

680
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,330
那時候真棒
Oh, yeah, we had us a good time.

681
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,700
我們就坐著, 然後吃回餅乾
We'd sit there and eat us them biscuits.

682
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,340
然後聖彼得會去睡一會
And then Saint Peter would go off to sleep,

683
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,140
叫我到審判的時候
and tell me to wake him up

684
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,340
叫醒他
when it's time to open the gates for the judgment.

685
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:33,080
進來吧, 我會一大堆餅乾給你
Well, come on, I'll make you a big batch of biscuits.

686
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,080
Troy, 我看到聖彼得的名冊上有你的名字
Hey, Troy. Saint Peter got your name in his book. I seen it.

687
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,180
寫著Troy Maxson
It say, "Troy Maxson."

688
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,150
我跟他說: 我認識他
I say, "i know him.

689
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:44,420
我們有同樣的姓 [Maxson]
He got the same name like what I got.

690
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,490
那是我的兄長
"That's my brother."

691
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,290
你要跟我說多少次這故事?
How many times you gonna tell me that, Gabe?

692
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,360
名冊上沒有我的名字, 不會有的
Ain't got my name in the book. Don't have to have my name.

693
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,730
我死過了, 也到過天堂
I done died and went to heaven.

694
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,970
但他有你的名字
But he got your name, though.

695
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:02,270
一天早上, 聖彼得在看他的名冊
One morning, Saint Peter was looking at his book,

696
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,080
他在準備審判的到來
and he was marking it up for the judgment,

697
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,180
他讓我看了你的名字
and he let me see your name.

698
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,110
在M的那一類別下
He got it in there under "M."

699
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,150
也有Rose的名字
He got Rose's name.

700
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:15,420
我沒有親眼看到, 但我知道的
I ain't seen it like I seen yours, but I know it's in there.

701
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,190
他有本很大的名冊
He got a great big book! Whoo!

702
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,060
上面有所有存在過的人的名字
He got everybody's name what was ever been born.

703
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,290
他親口告訴我的
That's what he told me.

704
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:27,230
但我親眼看到你的名字
But I seen your name. I seen it with my own eye.

705
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,200
進去吧
Come in the house.

706
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,770
Rose會煮點什麼給你吃
Rose gonna fix you something to eat now.

707
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:32,300
我不餓, 我吃了早餐了
I ain't hungry. I done had breakfast

708
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,340
和Jemima姨姨吃

709
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,480
她過來, 為我煮了很多烙餅
She come by, cook me up a whole mess of flapjacks!

710
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,340
好了, 進去吧, Rose會...
All right. Come on, let's go in the house. Rose fix us...

711
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,050
還記得我們以前怎麼吃烙餅嗎?
Remember how we used to eat them flapjacks?

712
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,210
記得, 進來吧
Yes, I remember. Come on now.

713
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,350
- 我要走了   - Gabe!
- I got to go!   - Gabe!

714
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,120
- 我要走了   - Gabe, 進來吧
- I got to go!   - Gabe, come on now!

715
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,050
我要去賣李子
I got to go sell my plums!

716
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,090
我賣了點蕃茄
I done sold some tomatoes.

717
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,060
賺了五角, 想看嗎?
Got me two quarters. Want to see?

718
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,560
我要儲起來買個新喇叭
I'm gonna save 'em and buy me a new horn,

719
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:00,500
好讓到審判時, 聖彼得能聽到
so Saint Peter can hear me when it's time to open the gate.

720
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,200
你聽到嗎?
You hear that?

721
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,270
是地獄之犬
You hear that? That's the hellhound.

722
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,110
我要把它們趕走
I'm gonna chase them out of here.

723
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:13,140
走啊! 別來這!
Go on! Get out of here! Get out! Get out!

724
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,140
[詩歌]

725
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:13,100
Gabe在哪?
Where's Gabe?

726
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,110
他又到處跑了
He's gone off somewhere.

727
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,240
他沒有好好吃飯
He ain't eating right.

728
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,610
Pearl小姐說他不肯吃
Miss Pearl say she can't get him to eat nothing.

729
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,180
你想我怎樣?
What you want me to do about it, Rose?

730
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,880
我為他做了我能做的事
I did everything I could for the man.

731
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,550
我不能讓他康復
I can't make him get well.

732
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:28,850
打仗時他被傷及腦袋了, 你想他怎樣?
Man got half his head blown off, what you expect?

733
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,590
有些事還是能為他做的
Seems like something ought to be done to help him.

734
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,190
他也不打擾誰
The man don't bother nobody.

735
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,460
因為他的腦袋裏有塊金屬碎片
He just mixed up 'cause of that metal plate

736
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,330
所以他才瘋瘋癲癲, 沒理由...
he got in his head. Ain't no sense in...

737
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,430
謝謝, 沒理由讓他住在醫院
Thank you. Ain't no sense in sending him to the hospital.

738
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,630
至少他會吃點什麼
At least he'd be eating right.

739
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,330
他們會照顧他
They could help him take care of himself.

740
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,900
沒有人想被鎖起來
Don't nobody want to be locked up, Rose.

741
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,900
你為何想鎖起他?
What you want to lock the man up for?

742
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,540
他上戰場
Man going down there,

743
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:52,910
跟日本人打仗
over there and fight that war, messing with them japs,

744
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,580
炸傷了腦袋
getting half his head blown off.

745
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,450
他們隨便賠了三千塊, 我都接受了
They give him a lousy $3,000. I got to swoop down on that.

746
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,880
你又要說這個了嗎?
Is you fixing to get into that again?

747
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,150
他的腦袋裏有塊金屬碎片
He got a metal plate in his head.

748
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,220
而那就是我得到這間房子的原因
That's the only reason I got a roof over my head

749
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,660
就因為那金屬碎片
is 'cause of that metal plate.

750
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,590
你沒理由自責的
Ain't no sense in you blaming yourself for nothing.

751
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,930
他不能管理好那筆錢
Gabe was in no condition to manage that money.

752
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,900
你為他做了正確的事
You done what was right by him.

753
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,330
沒人能說你不是
Can't nobody say you ain't done what was right by him.

754
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,300
看看你照顧他多久了
Look how long you took care of him.

755
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:17,470
一直至到他想要有自己的地方, 才搬去Pearl小姐那
Till he wanted his own place
and moved over there with Miss Pearl.

756
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:20,200
女人, 那不是我想說的, 我只是...
That ain't what I'm saying, woman. I'm just...

757
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,210
我只是在說事實
I'm just stating the facts.

758
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,310
要是我的弟弟沒有受傷
If my brother didn't have a metal plate in his head,

759
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,650
我就不會有上廁所的地方
I wouldn't have a pot to piss in

760
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,310
不會有個後院
or a window to throw it out of.

761
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,220
我都53歲了...
And I'm 53...

762
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,530
你要去哪?
Where you going off to?

763
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,400
你近期每個星期六都出去
You been running out of here every Saturday for weeks.

764
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,330
我以為你會築起那藩籬
I thought you were gonna work on this fence.

765
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:50,200
我去Taylor的酒吧裏
I'm gonna go down to Taylors' and, uh...

766
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,720
媽媽?
Mama?

767
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,290
Cory, 你爸爸對你今早還沒完成家務
Oh, Cory. Your daddy like to have a fit with you

768
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:47,020
就跑出去非常憤怒
running out of here this morning without doing your chores.

769
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,000
你還好嗎?
You all right?

770
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,730
他說你本該幫忙築起藩籬
He say you supposed to be helping him with the fence.

771
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,400
我說過要去練習啊
I told you I had to go to practice.

772
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,430
他過去幾個星期六都這樣說
And he's been saying that the last four or five Saturdays,

773
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:58,540
然後就跑到Taylor的酒吧
and then don't ever do nothing but go down to Taylors'.

774
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,010
你有跟他說錄取的事嗎?
You told him about the recruiter?

775
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,570
有
Yeah, I told him.

776
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,740
- 那他怎麼說? - 他沒說什麼
- Well, what'd he say? - He didn't say nothing too much.

777
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,580
在他回來前快完成家務
Go on and get started on your chores before he gets back here.

778
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,350
在他回來又要抱怨前
Go on and scrub down them steps

779
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:13,350
快去刷刷地板
before he come back here hollering and carrying on!

780
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,320
現在啊, 小子
Go! Boy, go!

781
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:41,050
繼續吧, Troy, 你早晚會把我嚇死的
Go on, Troy. You liked to scare me to death.

782
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,220
比賽怎麼了?
What was the score of the game?

783
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,380
Lucille在電話說過, 但我沒留意
Lucille had me on the phone. I couldn't keep up with it.

784
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,780
我為何在意比賽了? 來吧, 女人
What do I care about the game? Come here, woman.

785
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,250
我以為你去Taylor那裏
I thought you went down to Taylors'

786
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,790
就是為了看比賽, 讓我走
to listen to the game. Go on, Troy.

787
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,720
我以為你要築起那藩籬
I thought you're supposed to be putting up the fence.

788
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,320
我會去的, 在我處理好...
I'll put it up when I finish with what...

789
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,530
我手上的事
Is at hand.

790
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:57,700
快去吧, 真不懂你的
Go on, Troy. I ain't studying you!

791
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,730
但我懂你, 我會好好的弄清楚你
I'm studying you. I'm finna do my homework.

792
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,600
夠了
Troy, you better leave me alone!

793
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,740
Cory回來了嗎?
Where Cory? That boy brought his butt home yet?

794
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,410
他在上面做家務
He's upstairs doing his chores.

795
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:09,640
Cory, 快下來...
Cory, get your butt...

796
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,410
- 你去哪?   - 很快會來
- Where you going?   - I'll be right back.

797
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:15,880
- 何時?   - 就街口那
- When?   - I'm just going right down the street.

798
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:19,820
去哪? 跟誰?
Where? Who?

799
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,320
Troy, 進去吧
Troy, go in the house.

800
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,150
你到現在才回來嗎?
You just now coming here from leaving this morning?

801
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,750
- 對, 我要去練習   - 對什麼?
- Yeah, I had to go to football practice... - Yeah, what?

802
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,730
對, 先生
Yes, sir.

803
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,520
我才不看你一會
I ain't but two seconds off you, no way.

804
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,160
那垃圾箱都要滿了
That garbage sitting in there, overflowing.

805
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,560
你沒做過家務
You ain't done none of your chores.

806
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,590
現在也沒禮貌
Now you come in here, talking about, "yeah."

807
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,460
我剛想做, 爸
I was just getting ready to do my chores now, pop.

808
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,700
你的首要是星期六幫我築起藩籬
Your first chore is to help me with this fence on Saturday.

809
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,470
所有事都放在那之後
Everything else come after that.

810
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,770
去拿木鋸, 我們要鋸開這些木板
Now, get that saw, we gonna cut these boards.

811
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,870
嘿, 爸
Hey, pop.

812
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,780
你為何不買電視?
Why don't you buy a TV?

813
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,480
我要來做什麼?
What I want with a TV? What I want one of them for?

814
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,450
現在每人家裏都有一台
Everybody got one. Earl, Ba Bra, Jesse.

815
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,620
我不是在問誰有電視, 我是問要來做什麼?
I ain't asked who had one, I said what I want with one?

816
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,950
所以你可以看啊, 現在有很多不同的節目
So, you can watch it. They got lots of things on TV.

817
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,520
- 棒球也有   - 是嗎?
- Baseball and everything.   - Yeah?

818
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,750
我們可以看世界大賽
We could watch the world series.

819
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,820
- 那買電視要多少錢?    - 我不清楚
- Yeah, how much this TV cost?   - I don't know.

820
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,630
我看見過優惠價二百塊
They got 'em on sale for about $200.

821
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,460
- 二百塊?   - 那不算貴, 爸
- $200?   - That ain't that much, pop.

822
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,860
是啊, 才二百塊而已
No, that's just $200.

823
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,000
你有留意那屋頂嗎?
You see that roof you got sitting over your head at night?

824
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,470
我來告訴你那屋頂的事
Let me tell you something about that roof.

825
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:49,440
那屋頂已經十年沒塗上焦油了
It's been 10 years since that roof was last tarred.

826
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,910
然後到了冬天下雪時
See, now snow come this winter,

827
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,580
雪積聚在屋頂上
sit up on that roof like it is,

828
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,610
然後一點點的慢慢地滲透到裏面
it's gonna seep inside, just gonna be a little bit,

829
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,750
你甚至不會注意到
you ain't gonna hardly notice it,

830
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,820
然後當你發現時
then next thing you know,

831
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,580
早已滲透到各處
it's gonna be leaking all over the house.

832
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,650
然後因為積水, 木材會腐蝕
Then the wood rot from all that water,

833
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,650
到時候你就需要把整個屋頂換掉
and you gonna need a whole new roof.

834
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,790
你猜要多少才能修好?
Now how much you think it cost to get that roof fixed?

835
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,990
- 我不知道   - $264現金, 明白了嗎?
- I don't know.   - $264 cash money. See?

836
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,860
當你在想買電視
While you be thinking about a TV,

837
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,600
我就得擔心頭上的屋頂
I got to be thinking about the roof

838
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,200
又或是要修理的東西
or whatever else go wrong around here.

839
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,200
如果你有二百塊, 你會怎做?
Now if you had $200, what would you do?

840
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,670
修理屋頂還是買電視?
Fix the roof, or buy a TV?

841
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,010
買電視, 當屋頂開始滲水時
I'd buy a TV. And when the roof started to leak,

842
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,610
我才修理它
if it needed fixing, I'd fix it.

843
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,910
你哪來的錢?
Where you gonna get your money from?

844
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:25,680
你都花在買電視上了
You done spent it on a TV.

845
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,480
到時候你在裏面
You gonna sit up in there,

846
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,810
看著漏水滴到你的新電視上嗎?
let that water run all over your brand-new TV?

847
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,580
爸, 我知道你有錢的
Pop, you got the money. I know you do.

848
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,250
- 在哪?    - 銀行裏
- Where I got it at, huh?   - In the bank.

849
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,520
你想看我的存摺嗎?
You want to see my bank book?

850
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:37,620
你想看我那$73.22的存款嗎?
You want to see that $73.22 I got sitting up in there?

851
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,260
你不需要一次付清
You don't have to pay for it all at one time.

852
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,230
可以先給首期, 之後分期付款
You can put a down payment on it, and carry it on with you.

853
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,930
除非情況緊急, 我才不會讓自己欠別人東西
Not me. I ain't owing nobody nothing if I can help it.

854
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:46,700
遲了付款, 他們就會來帶走它
Miss a payment, they come and snatch it right out of your house.

855
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,800
那你就白付了, 明白了嗎?
Then what you got, huh? See?

856
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,540
如果我有整整$200塊, 我會選擇買電視
Now, when I get $200 clear, I'll buy me a TV.

857
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,840
要是我手上有$264塊, 我就會選擇修理屋頂
Right now, when I get $264, I'm gonna get that roof fixed.

858
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,910
爸...
Oh, pop...

859
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,510
如果你想買電視
You go get you $200

860
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,740
就自己賺$200塊
and buy you a TV if you want to.

861
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,550
我的錢要花在更實用的地方
I got better things to do with my money.

862
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,780
我賺不到$200, 我甚至沒見過$200
I can't get $200. I ain't never seen $200.

863
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,520
好吧, 我跟你說
All right, I'll tell you what.

864
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,720
我們各人付$100
You get $100, I'll put the other $100 with it.

865
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:10,990
好吧, 等著我
All right, I'm gonna show you.

866
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,660
現在給我看你如何切開這些木板
Yeah, show me how you can cut these boards right now.

867
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,790
拿著, 那值$200塊
There you go. That's $200 worth.

868
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,370
- 匹茲堡海盜隊今天贏了   - 是嗎?
- The Pirates won today.   - Yeah?

869
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,040
連續贏五場了
That makes five in a row.

870
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,870
我沒在意海盜隊, 他們都只有白人球員
I ain't thinking about no Pirates. They got an all-white team.

871
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:29,740
他們有個波多黎各的球員, Clemente是吧?
Got that boy, though, that Puerto Rican boy, Clemente?

872
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,870
也不讓他出出場
Don't even half play him.

873
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,780
如果給那孩子機會, 他會是位偉大的球員
That boy could be something if they'd give him a chance.

874
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:35,280
讓他上一天場, 隔天又坐板凳了
Play him one day, sit him on the bench the next.

875
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,850
他也常上場啊
He gets lots of chances to play.

876
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,620
我在說每天都上場, 當正選
I'm talking about playing every day, playing regular,

877
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,280
這才能學到更多啊
so you can get your timing, that's what I'm talking about.

878
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,590
他們隊裏也有些白人不是每天都能上場
They got some white guys on the team that don't play every day.

879
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,960
你總不能讓全部人上場
You can't play everybody at the same time.

880
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,760
如果有個白人球員是當後備的
If they got a white fellow sitting on the bench,

881
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,330
你可以肯定他根本不會打棒球
you can bet your last dollar he can't play.

882
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,630
有色人種要出色兩倍才能當正選
Colored guy got to be twice as good to get on the team.

883
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:53,330
那就是我不想你進球隊的原因
That's why I don't want you getting all tied up in them sports.

884
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,630
進去了又如何?
Man on the team, what it get him?

885
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,630
球隊的有色人種不被重用
Got colored on the team, don't even use him.

886
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,340
如同沒有他們一樣, 所有球隊都是這樣的
Same as not having them. All them teams the same.

887
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,770
亞特蘭大勇士隊也有Hank Aaron和Wes Covington
The Braves got Hank Aaron and Wes Covington.

888
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,880
Hank Aaron已經有43個全壘打了, 算上今天兩個的話
Hank Aaron hit two home runs today. That makes 43.

889
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,880
Aaron不算什麼, 那是你該做的
Aaron ain't nobody. That's what you supposed to do.

890
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,780
你該全力以赴
That's how the game's supposed to be played.

891
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,080
沒別的, 不過是
Ain't nothing to it. It's a matter of getting

892
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,680
抓準時機然後揮棒
your timing and follow through.

893
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,820
我現在也可以打43個全壘打
Hell, I can hit 43 home runs right now.

894
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,350
你不能在美國職業棒球大聯盟裏打得出來
Not off no Major-League pitcher, you couldn't.

895
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,950
我們在黑人聯盟裏有更強的投手
We had better pitching in the negro leagues.

896
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,890
我在Satchel Paige身上打過七次全壘打
I hit seven home runs off of Satchel Paige.

897
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,260
你不會找到比他更好的球員
You can't get no better than that.

898
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,930
Sandy Koufax, 他是聯盟裏三振次數最多的
Sandy Koufax, he leading the league in strikeouts.

899
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,660
我不是在想Sandy Koufax的事
I ain't thinking about no Sandy Koufax.

900
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,330
還有Warren Spahn和Lew Burdette, 我猜你...
You got Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette. I bet you...

901
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,760
我不想再說了
I'm through with it now.

902
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,170
去鋸木板吧
Go and cut them boards.

903
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,810
你媽媽跟我說你被大學美式足球隊錄取了
Your mama told me you got recruited by a college football team.

904
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,110
真有此事嗎?
Is that right?

905
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,680
對, Zellman教練說
Yeah, coach Zellman say

906
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,680
晚點會有負責人跟你商討
the recruiter gonna be coming by to talk to you.

907
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,780
讓你簽同意書
Get you to sign the permission papers.

908
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,350
我以為你會在A&P裏工作
I thought you was supposed to be working down the A&P.

909
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,020
你放學後不是應該到那裏工作嗎?
Ain't you supposed to be working down there after school?

910
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,920
Stawicki先生說他會替我留著位子
Mr. Stawicki say he gonna hold my job for me

911
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,690
直到賽季結束
until after the football season.

912
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:55,030
他說下周起, 我可以只上週末的班
He said starting next week, I can work weekends.

913
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:58,030
小子, 我以為我們說好了
Boy, I thought we had an understanding about this football stuff.

914
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,900
你應該繼續完成家務
You supposed to keep up with your chores,

915
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,830
繼續在A&P工作
hold your job down there at the A&P.

916
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:04,000
你今天大半天不在
You ain't been around here all day on a Saturday,

917
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,370
也沒完成家務
ain't none of your chores done.

918
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:07,100
現在你說你辭職了?
Now you come telling me you done quit your job?

919
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,170
- 我週末也會上班啊   - 當然了
- I'm gonna be working weekends. - You damn right you are!

920
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,110
那負責人也不必到來
And ain't no need for nobody to be coming around here,

921
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,640
跟我說籤署的事
talking to me about signing nothing.

922
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,720
爸, 你不能這樣做
Pop, you can't do that.

923
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:14,980
他大老遠從北卡羅萊納州來
He's coming all the way from north Carolina.

924
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,950
我才不在乎
I don't care where he coming from!

925
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,120
聽著, 小子
Look, boy,

926
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,820
那些白人無論如何也不會讓你
the white man ain't gonna let you

927
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,750
碰美式足球的
get nowhere with no football no way.

928
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,120
你繼續你的學業, 所以你可以...
Now you get your book-learning, so you can, uh,

929
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,130
在A&P有進升的機會, 還有學習維修車子
work your way up at the A&P
and learn how to fix cars,

930
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,990
或者建築, 讓自己有一技傍身
or build houses, get you a trade.

931
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,730
那樣你才有競爭力
This way, you got something can't nobody take away from you.

932
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:35,070
你的雙手
You go in and learn how to put your hands to good use

933
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:37,030
該做比清理垃圾更好的工作
besides hauling other people's garbage.

934
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,210
我的成績很好, 爸
I get good grades, pop.

935
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,770
那就是他們會跟你商討的原因
That's why the recruiter want to talk with you.

936
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,200
你的成績也要好才能被錄取的
You got to keep up your grades to get recruited.

937
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:43,140
這樣我就有機會上大學
This way, I'll be going to college, I'll get a chance.

938
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,880
首先, 你去A&P那拿回你的工作
First, you get your butt down there and get your job back.

939
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,180
Stawicki先生已經聘請了其他人
Mr. Stawicki done already hired somebody else

940
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,910
因為我跟他說我要打美式足球
'cause I told him I was playing football.

941
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,180
我比我想像中還蠢
You a bigger fool than I thought.

942
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,420
你竟然讓別人代替了你的位置
You gonna let somebody take away your job,

943
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,890
好讓你能打什麼美式足球
so you can play some football.

944
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,760
你上哪賺錢
Where you gonna get your money

945
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,090
照顧你的女友什麼的?
to take care of your girlfriend and whatnot?

946
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:01,760
到底有多蠢
What kind of foolishness is that

947
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,060
才會讓別人代替了自己?
to let somebody take away your job?

948
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,460
我週末還是會去工作的
I'm still gonna be working weekends.

949
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,760
不, 你去找另一份工作
No. You getting out of here and finding you another job.

950
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,940
別這樣, 爸, 我還得練習呢
Come on, pop. I gotta practice.

951
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,900
我不能同時工作和練習
I can't work after school and play football, too.

952
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,440
Zellman教練說球隊需要我
The team needs me, that's what Coach Zellman say.

953
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,770
我才不介意他說什麼, 我說了算, 明白了嗎?
I don't care what nobody say. I'm the boss. You understand?

954
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:17,010
我是你的父親, 我說的才算
I'm the boss around here. I do the only saying what counts.

955
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,480
- 別這樣...    - 我問你: 你明白了嗎?
- Come on...  - I asked you, "do you understand?"

956
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,480
- 明白   - 什麼?
- Yeah.   - What?

957
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,820
- 明白, 先生    - 好了
- Yes, sir.   - All right.

958
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:29,060
你去A&P看看能不能取回你的工作
You get on down there to that A&P and see if you can get your job back.

959
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,490
如果只能二選其一, 那就放棄進球隊吧
If you can't do both, then you quit the football team.

960
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:33,790
人生不如意事十常八九
You got to take the crookeds with the straights.

961
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:34,990
明白, 先生
Yes, sir.

962
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,030
我可以問你點事嗎?
Can I ask you a question?

963
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,800
你又要問什麼?
What the hell you got to ask me?

964
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,510
你該問Stawicki先生工作的事
Mr. Stawicki the one you got the questions for.

965
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,110
你為何從不喜歡我?
How come you ain't never liked me?

966
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:55,750
喜歡你? 誰說我一定要喜歡你?
Like you? Who the hell said I got to like you?

967
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:59,150
有什麼規定要我一定要喜歡你?
What law is there say I got to like you?

968
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,520
既然站在我面前
You want to stand up in front of my face

969
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,250
問這蠢極了的問題
and ask a damn fool-ass question like that.

970
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,820
還扯什麼喜歡誰
Talk about liking somebody.

971
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,120
說話時站近點, 小子
Come here, boy, when I talk to you.

972
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:12,000
該死的, 站好, 我問你
Straighten up, god damn it! I asked you a question.

973
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,030
- 有什麼規定要我一定要喜歡你?   - 沒有
- What law is there say I got to like you?   - None.

974
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:17,100
正是, 你三餐溫飽嗎?
All right, then. Don't you eat every day?

975
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,970
我問你問題時, 你就得回答我
Answer me when I talk to you.

976
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,040
- 你三餐溫飽嗎?   - 對
- Don't you eat every day?   - Yeah.

977
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,910
小子, 你一天在我的地方
Nigger, as long as you in my house,

978
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,980
你就得加在句子最後加上"先生"
you put a "Sir" on the end of it when you talk to me.

979
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,280
- 是, 先生   - 你每天都有飯吃?
- Yes, sir.   - You eat every day?

980
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,880
- 是, 先生    - 有地方住?
- Yes, sir.   - Got a roof over your head?

981
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,050
- 是, 先生   - 有衣服穿?
- Yes, sir.   - Got clothes on your back?

982
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,850
- 是, 先生   - 原因呢?
- Yes, sir.   - Why you think that is?

983
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:32,980
- 全因為你   - 我當然知道是因為我
- 'Cause of you.   - Hell, I know it's 'cause of me.

984
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,250
但你認為是因為什麼?
But why do you think that is?

985
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,290
因為你喜歡我?
'Cause you like me?

986
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,290
"喜歡"你
"Like" you.

987
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,260
我每天一大清早出去工作
I go out of here every morning,

988
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,860
還得時時刻刻忍受那些白人 [crackers帶侮辱之意]
I bust my butt putting up with them crackers every day

989
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,530
才算得上"喜歡"你
'cause I "like" you.

990
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:50,830
你簡直是我見過最愚蠢的人, 那是我的職責
You about the biggest fool I ever saw. It's my job.

991
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,570
我的責任
It's my responsibility.

992
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:55,570
一個男人就該照顧他的家庭
A man is supposed to take care of his family.

993
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:58,540
你住在我的房子裏, 吃我買回來的食物
You live in my house, fill your belly with my food,

994
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:02,180
我照顧你是因為你是我的兒子啊
put your behind on my bed because you're my son.

995
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:05,120
而不是我喜歡你, 照顧你是我的職責
Not 'cause I like you. 'Cause it's my duty to take care of you.

996
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,880
我得承擔起這個責任
I owe a responsibility to you.

997
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,890
現在我就說清楚
Now, let's get this straight right here and now,

998
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,290
以免你將來又說同樣的話
before it go along any further.

999
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,990
我不需要喜歡你
I ain't got to like you.

1000
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:16,130
Rand先生每星期發薪給我不是因為他喜歡我
Mr. Rand don't give me my money come payday 'cause he like me.

1001
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:19,230
是因為他欠我的
He give it to me 'cause he owe me.

1002
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,300
現在我已給了所有我該給你的
Now I done give you everything I got to give you.

1003
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,870
我把你帶到這個世界上啊!
I give you your life!

1004
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,800
你媽媽和我都商討好各自的職責
Me and your mama worked that out between us,

1005
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,610
而喜歡你不是我的工作之一
and liking your black ass wasn't part of the bargain.

1006
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,780
你從今起別再
Now don't you go through life

1007
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:32,310
擔心別人是否喜歡你
worrying about whether somebody like you, or not.

1008
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:35,580
你該想他們沒有負了你
You best be making sure they're doing right by you.

1009
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:36,950
- 明白了嗎?   - 明白, 先生
- You understand what I'm saying?   - Yes, sir.

1010
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:40,980
那現在滾開, 去A&P拿回你的工作
Then get the hell out of my face and get on down to that A&P!

1011
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,640
你為何就不讓那孩子打美式足球呢, Troy?
Why don't you go ahead and let the boy play football, Troy?

1012
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,650
他只想像你一樣在運動有點成就
He just want to be like you with the sports.

1013
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,950
我不想他重蹈覆轍
I don't want him to be like me.

1014
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,380
我想他走條和我完全不同的路
I want him to get as far away from my life

1015
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:13,550
越不同越好
as he possibly can get.

1016
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,020
你是我生命中唯一遇過的好事, Rose
You the only decent thing ever happened to me, Rose.

1017
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:17,990
我希望他找個像你一樣好的女人
And I wish him that.

1018
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:21,420
除此之外我不希望他像我一樣
But I don't wish him nothing else from my life.

1019
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,030
我在他出生的那天就決定
I decided 17 years ago,

1020
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:26,400
那孩子不要參與什麼運動
that boy wasn't gonna get involved in no sports.

1021
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,200
在我明白運動裏的不公之後
Not after what they did to me in the sports.

1022
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,400
你為何就不承認你當時不能進職業聯盟是因為年紀?
Why don't you just admit you were too old for the Major Leagues?

1023
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,200
就承認一次?
For once, why don't you just admit that?

1024
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,040
別跟我來年紀這套
Don't you come tellin' me I was too old.

1025
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,270
是因為我是有色人種而已, 我現在都53歲了
I just wasn't the right color. Hell, I'm 53 years old,

1026
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,380
但我肯定我能打出比S的.269更好的成績
I can do better than Selkirk's .269 right now.

1027
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,010
過了40歲還怎樣打棒球?
How were you gonna play ball when you were over 40?

1028
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,650
有時候你說的話真不合邏輯
Sometimes, I can't get no sense out of you.

1029
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,820
我很清醒, 女人
I got good sense, woman.

1030
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:49,190
我清楚知道別讓運動傷了他的身心
I got sense enough not to let that boy get hurt playing no sports.

1031
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:50,950
你太疼愛他了
You mothering the boy too much.

1032
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,120
讓他老是擔心別人是否喜歡自己
Worrying about whether people "like" him or not.

1033
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:56,290
那孩子做的所有事, 都是為了給你看
Everything that boy do, he do for you.

1034
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,100
他想你稱讚他, 僅此而已
He wants you to say, "good job, son." That's all.

1035
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,430
Rose, 我沒時間做這些事, 他好好的活著
I ain't got time for that, Rose. He's alive, he's healthy.

1036
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:06,100
就得自己找出路, 我也得繼續自己的生活
He's got to make his own way. I made mine.

1037
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,270
他將來出社會後
Ain't nobody gonna hold his hand

1038
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,670
沒有人會時常照顧他的
when he get out there in the world.

1039
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:11,140
Troy, 時代不同了
Times have changed, Troy.

1040
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,240
人會變的
People change.

1041
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,480
世界在變, 而你根本不知道
The world changing, and you can't even see it.

1042
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,020
女人, 我盡我所能地工作
Woman, I do the best I can do.

1043
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,290
每星期五我帶著
I come in here every Friday,

1044
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:29,230
一袋馬鈴薯和一桶豬油回來
I carry a sack of potatoes and a bucket of lard.

1045
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:33,030
你們才得以不用工作
You all line up at the door with your hands out.

1046
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:34,730
我連最後的錢都用在你們身上
I give you the lint from my pockets.

1047
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:36,470
我付出了我的血汗
I give you my sweat and my blood.

1048
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:39,270
我無法給你們同情, 早已用光了
I ain't got no tears. I done spent them.

1049
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:42,070
我們晚上到樓上做愛
We go upstairs in that room at night, I fall down on you

1050
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:45,440
在你裏面給了我唯一所剩的
and try to blast a hole into forever.

1051
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,040
星期一早上起來, 帶著桌上煮好的午餐
I get up Monday morning, find my lunch on the table,

1052
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:49,310
出去繼續我的生活
go out and make my way.

1053
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:53,720
試著捱到星期五
Find my strength to get me through to next Friday.

1054
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,250
那就是我能給的, Rose
That's all I got, Rose.

1055
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:01,190
那已經是我能給你們的全部了
That's all I got to give.

1056
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,030
已經沒什麼可以再給你們了!
Can't give nothing else!

1057
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,160
Maxson先生?
Mr. Maxson?

1058
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,300
理事長想見你
Commissioner will see you now.

1059
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,410
Rose!
Rose!

1060
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:53,110
嘿, Ro!
Hey, Ro!

1061
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:57,410
我真想看到Rand先生當時的糗樣
I wish I could've seen Mr. Rand's face when he told you.

1062
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,350
他聽了判決後都說不出話來了
He couldn't get it out his mouth. Liked to bit his tongue.

1063
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:02,350
當他們叫我到理事長的辦公室時
When they called me down there to the commissioner's office,

1064
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:05,260
Rand像所有人一樣都以為他們要炒了我
he thought they was gonna fire me, like everybody else.

1065
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,090
我可沒有這樣想
Oh, I didn't think they was gonna fire you.

1066
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:09,430
我以為他們要給你警告信
I thought they's gonna put you on the warning paper.

1067
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:12,830
嘿, Rose! 對, Rand先生這下一定無話可說了
Hey, Rose! Yeah, Mr. Rand liked to bit his tongue.

1068
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:15,130
我看到你跑到Taylor的酒吧
I see you run right down there to Taylors'

1069
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:16,400
告訴那個叫Alberta的女子
and told that Alberta gal.

1070
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,470
嘿, Rose! 我跟所有人都會說的, 嘿, Ro!
Hey, Rose! I told everybody. Hey, Ro!

1071
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:21,500
我去那兌現支票 [花錢]
I went down there to cash my check.

1072
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:22,370
嘿!
Hey!

1073
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:25,380
別叫了, 我知道你回來了
Hush all that hollering. I know you out here.

1074
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,280
理事長怎說了?
What they say down at the commissioner's office?

1075
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,210
我叫你的時候你就該立刻回應我, 女人
You supposed to come when I call you, woman.

1076
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:30,380
Bono也懂
Bono will tell you that.

1077
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,120
你叫Lucille時她不也立刻回應嗎?
Don't Lucille come when you call her?

1078
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,650
閉嘴吧老兄, 我又不是狗
Man, hush your mouth. I ain't no dog.

1079
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,420
說什麼立刻回應你
Talk about come when you call me.

1080
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:36,290
Bono, 看到了嗎? 我以前有隻狗
You hear this, Bono? I used to have me an old dog

1081
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,460
也像這樣自以為高人一等
get uppity like that.

1082
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:40,160
你喊他來, 他也不理會
You say, "come here, Blue,"he just lay there, look at you.

1083
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,360
最後通常都是被追著打, 為了教訓他
End up getting a stick chasin' him away, trying to make him come.

1084
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,860
我不在意你和你的狗
I ain't studying you and your dog.

1085
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,600
我記得你總會唱起歌來
I remember you used to sing that old song.

1086
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:51,700
沒有人想聽啊
Nobody wants to hear that old song.

1087
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,370
他唱起來時, 總讓Cory到處跑
Used to have Cory runnin' around here singin' that song.

1088
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:58,170
我也記得那首歌
Hell, I remember that song myself.

1089
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,370
那是我爸爸的歌
That's my daddy's song.

1090
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,190
他創作的
My daddy made up that song.

1091
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,350
我才不在乎誰作的, 沒有人想聽你唱的
I don't care who made it up. Don't nobody want to hear you sing it.

1092
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:13,620
你這麼興奮回來, 我就猜到他們沒有炒了你
You come in here carrying on, I reckon they ain't fired you.

1093
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,630
理事長到底說了什麼?
What they say down there at
the commissioner's office?

1094
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:18,900
Rose, 聽著, Rand先生在理事長會見我後
Look here, Rose. Mr. Rand called me in his office

1095
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,460
叫我到他的辦公室
after I got back from talkin' to them people down there.

1096
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:24,130
他叫我進去並說
He called me in his office and told me...

1097
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,170
他們要讓我當司機!
They was making me a driver!

1098
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:30,510
- Troy, 你在說笑吧!   - 不信問Bono
- Troy, you kidding!   - No, I ain't. Ask Bono.

1099
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:31,640
那真好, Troy
That's great, Troy.

1100
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,340
那你再不用跟那些人糾纏了
Now you don't have to hassle them people no more.

1101
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,450
天啊, 沒想到今天你會來
Oh, hell. I didn't think I was gonna see you today.

1102
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,620
我以為你在監獄裏
I thought you was in jail.

1103
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:40,480
聽到消息說他們掃蕩Seefus的店
Got it all over the courier about them raiding Seefus' place

1104
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:43,220
那個你跟那些不倫不類的傢伙經常去的地方
where you be hanging out with all them thugs.

1105
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,890
嘿, 爸, 那跟我沒關係
Hey, pop, that ain't got nothing to do with me.

1106
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,060
我沒在那賭博
I don't go down there gambling.

1107
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:48,220
我只是去那跟樂隊交流
I just go down there to sit in with the band.

1108
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:50,360
那賭博跟我沾不上關係
I ain't got nothing to do with the gambling part.

1109
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,900
他們那裏有些很好的音樂人
They got some good music down there.

1110
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,630
那裏只有流氓而已
They got some rogues is what they got.

1111
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:55,670
Bono先生你還好嗎? 你好, Rose
How you been, Mr. Bono? Hi, Rose.

1112
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:58,540
我知道你今晚在Crawford Grill有演出 [爵士樂俱樂部]
I see where you playing down at the Crawford Grill tonight.

1113
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,240
你怎麼又不帶Bonnie來?
How come you ain't brought Bonnie like I told you?

1114
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,340
你該帶上她來
You shoulda brought Bonnie.

1115
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:02,570
她很久沒來過了
She ain't been by in a month of Sundays.

1116
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:03,910
我剛巧路過而已
I was just in the neighborhood.

1117
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:05,440
- 想著見你們一面   - 又來了
- Thought I'd stop by.   - Here it comes.

1118
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,640
你爸爸升職了
Your daddy got a promotion on the rubbish.

1119
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:10,250
他是第一個駕駛垃圾車的有色人種
He gonna be the first colored driver.

1120
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:11,480
什麼也不用做
Ain't got to do nothin' but sit up there

1121
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,180
像白人一樣坐著看報紙就行了
and read the paper, like them white fellas.

1122
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,690
爸, 如果你識字的話, 那會是件好事
Hey, pop, if you knew how to read, you'd be all right.

1123
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:18,420
不不, 你指如果這老兄懂得駕駛的話
Nah, nah. You mean if the nigger knew how to drive,

1124
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,560
那才是件好事
he'd be all right.

1125
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:22,090
一直跟那些人爭論駕車的問題
Been fighting with them people about driving

1126
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,330
然而連駕照也沒有
and ain't even got a license.

1127
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:24,960
Rand先生知道你沒有駕照的吧?
Mr. Rand know you ain't got no driver's license?

1128
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:26,130
駕車很容易
Driving ain't nothing.

1129
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,930
就是扭軑盤而已
All you do is point the truck where you want it to go.

1130
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,200
並不難
Driving ain't nothing.

1131
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:31,170
他們知道你沒有駕照嗎?
Do they know you ain't got no driver's license?

1132
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:32,470
那才是我問的
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1133
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,510
我不是問你駕駛是否容易
I ain't asked if driving was easy.

1134
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,670
我問你Rand先生是否知道你沒有駕照一事
I asked if Mr. Rand know you ain't got no driver's license.

1135
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:36,940
那人沒必要知道我的事
The man ain't got to know my business.

1136
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:39,280
待他發現時我已經有兩三個駕照了
Time he find out, I have two or three of them driver's license.

1137
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,280
- 聽著, 爸   - 我就知道你會這麼說
- Say, look here, pop.   - I knew it was coming.

1138
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,280
我知道你要說什麼
I knew what kinda "look here, pop" that was.

1139
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,650
那小子又要問我拿錢了
Nigger finna ask me for some money.

1140
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:46,520
今天是星期五, 又是我的發薪日
It's Friday night, it's my payday.

1141
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,290
那些沒被拘捕的流氓會在Avenue大道流連
All them rogues down on the Avenue, the ones that ain't in jail,

1142
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:52,960
Lyons趕著去跟他們會合
and Lyons is hopping in his shoes to get down there with them.

1143
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,030
聽著, 爸
Now, see, pop,

1144
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,590
如果你讓別人說完他要說的
if you gave somebody else a chance to talk sometime,

1145
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,400
你就會知道我要還你答應過的十塊
you'd see I was fixing to pay you back your $10 like I told you.

1146
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,530
拿著, 我說過待Bonnie發薪了我會還你的
Here. I told you I'd pay you when Bonnie got paid.

1147
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,740
不, 你自己留著那十塊, 存到銀行裏
No, you keep that $10. Put it in the bank.

1148
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,540
下次你覺得又要來這裏向我拿錢時
Next time you feel like you wanna come by here

1149
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,370
你就從銀行拿出這十塊
and ask me for somethin', you go down there and get that.

1150
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:11,310
拿著屬於你的十塊吧, 爸
Here you go your $10, pop.

1151
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:12,640
我說過我不想你給我
I told you, I don't want you to give me nothing.

1152
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:13,810
我只想借而已
I just wanted to borrow $10.

1153
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,710
不, 你留著下次用
No, you keep that for the next time you want to ask me.

1154
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,350
別這樣, 爸, 拿著吧
Come on, pop, here go your $10.

1155
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:21,480
Troy, 你為何不讓那孩子還錢?
Troy, why don't you let the boy pay you back?

1156
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,720
你替他拿吧, Rose, 如果你不拿
Here you go, Rose. If you don't take it,

1157
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,730
接下來六個月他又要不斷嘮叨此事了
I'm gonna hear about it for the next six months.

1158
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:30,560
你也可以順道給出你的那份薪金, Troy
You can hand yours over, too, Troy.

1159
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,330
Bono, 你看到他們怎對待我了嗎
You see this, Bono? You see how they do me?

1160
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:34,030
看到, Lucille也是這樣做
Yeah, Lucille do me the same way.

1161
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:45,340
嘿, 是Troy的兒子啊
Hey. Hey, there's Troy's boy!

1162
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,640
Gabe叔叔, 你最近好嗎?
How you doing, Uncle Gabe?

1163
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,410
Lyons!
Lyons!

1164
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:52,580
萬獸之王
The king of the jungle!

1165
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:55,750
嘿, Rose, 我有朵玫瑰花給你
Rose. Hey, Rose, I got a flower for you.

1166
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:58,450
我親自摘的, 就跟你名字一樣的玫瑰
I picked it myself. That's the same rose like you is.

1167
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,060
你真有心, Gabe
Aw, that's right nice of you, Gabe.

1168
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:01,660
Gabe叔叔, 你最近在做什麼?
What you been doing, Uncle Gabe?

1169
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:05,400
噢, 我一直在追趕地獄之犬
Oh, I been chasing hellhounds and waiting for the time

1170
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,360
並等著告訴聖彼得打開天堂的門
to tell Saint Peter to open the gates.

1171
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:08,800
你在追趕地獄之犬?
You been chasing hellhounds, huh?

1172
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,700
你做得很正確
Well, you doing the right thing, Uncle Gabe.

1173
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:13,770
- 總有人要去趕走他們   - 是的, 我也知道
- Somebody's got to chase 'em.   - Oh, yeah, I know it.

1174
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:16,740
魔鬼很強大, 不是那麼容易打敗
The devil's strong. The devil ain't no pushover.

1175
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:19,380
地獄之犬一直在尋找人類的氣息 [應為sniff, 非snip]
Hellhounds snipping at everybody's heels.

1176
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:22,050
但我已經準備好喇叭, 等待審判日的來臨
But I got my trumpet waiting on the judgment time.

1177
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:23,750
為了哈米吉多頓之戰作準備嗎? [聖經中世界末日最後一戰]
Waiting on the Battle of Armageddon, huh?

1178
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,820
噢, 那眨眼就會結束
Oh, ain't gonna be too much of a battle

1179
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:29,550
當上帝揮動審判之劍時
when god get to waving that judgment sword.

1180
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,650
如果天堂的門關上的話, 那時候人們就得費時
But the people's gonna have a hell of a time

1181
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:34,420
等待進入天堂了
trying to get into heaven if them gates ain't open.

1182
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:35,790
你聽到這嗎, 爸?
You hear this, pop?

1183
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:37,590
Gabe叔叔, 你人真好
Uncle Gabe, you all right.

1184
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,660
Lyons.
Lyons.

1185
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:42,870
萬獸之王
The king of the jungle!

1186
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:44,300
Gabe, 你留下來吃晚餐嗎?
You stayin' for supper, Gabe?

1187
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:45,370
你要我煮你的份嗎?
You want me to fix you a plate?

1188
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,500
我要份三明治就好了, 不用煮我的份
I'll just take a sandwich, Rose. I don't want no plate.

1189
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:50,610
我喜歡用雙手拿著來吃, 三明治好了
I want to eat with my hands. I'll take a sandwich.

1190
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:53,080
你呢Lyons? 留下嗎? 在煮牛小排呢
What about you, Lyons? You stayin'? Got some short ribs cooking.

1191
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:56,650
不了, 我通常在演出完結後才用餐的
Nah. I won't eat nothing till after we finish playing.

1192
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,420
你應該來看看我演出, 爸
You ought to come down, listen to me play, pop.

1193
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,650
噢, 我不喜歡那些像中國音樂一樣的嘈音
Oh, I don't like all that Chinese music, all that noise.

1194
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:05,120
去洗手吧, Gabe, 我現在弄三明治
Go in there and wash up, Gabe. I'll fix you a sandwich.

1195
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,820
Troy在生我的氣
Troy mad at me.

1196
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:09,430
你為何生他的氣?
What you mad at Uncle Gabe for?

1197
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:10,560
他以為Troy為了
He think Troy mad at him

1198
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,430
他搬到Pearl那裏而生氣
'cause he moved over there to Miss Pearl's.

1199
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:14,530
我才沒有生氣, 他可以住他想住的地方
I ain't mad at the man. He can live where he want to live at.

1200
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,700
他為何搬到那裏? Pearl小姐任何人都不喜歡
Well, what he move over there for? Miss Pearl don't like nobody.

1201
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,570
噢, 她不介意他在, 還對他頗好
Oh, she don't mind him none. She treat him real nice.

1202
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,740
她就不允許他唱歌而已
She just don't allow all that singing.

1203
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:22,670
她不介意他在為她付租金, 僅此而已
She don't mind that rent he be paying. That's what she don't mind.

1204
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:24,440
Troy, 我不想再跟你討論此事
Troy, I ain't goin' through that with you no more.

1205
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,140
他搬到那因為他想要有自己的地方
He moved over there 'cause he wanted his own place.

1206
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:27,310
他可以隨他所想的做
He can come and go as he please.

1207
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,580
他可以在這裏做他想做的, 我也不介意
He can come and go as he please here. I wasn't stoppin' him.

1208
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:30,780
我也沒規定他什麼
I wasn't putting no rules on the man.

1209
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,620
你明知道那是兩碼子的事
That ain't the same thing, and you know it.

1210
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:34,590
我不想再討論這話題
Now that's the last I wanna hear about that.

1211
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,450
我不想再聽到Gabe和Miss Pearl之間的事
I don't wanna hear nothin' else about Gabe and Miss Pearl.

1212
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:37,490
還有下周...
And next week...

1213
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:39,320
我準備好了, Rose
I'm ready for my sandwich, Rose.

1214
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,420
還有下周, 當從學校來的負責人到來
And next week, when that recruiter come from that school,

1215
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:43,890
我要你簽署讓Cory進美式足球隊
I want you to sign that paper and go on and let Cory play football.

1216
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,800
我不想再聽你說起此事
That'll be the last I have to hear about that.

1217
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:52,600
Cory被錄取了? 他要到哪所學校?
Cory got recruited? What school he goin' to?

1218
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,170
我不想再理會Cory的事
I ain't thinking about Cory nothing.

1219
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:56,570
那小子把這裏當成他的地方
Boy walking around here smelling his piss,

1220
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:57,910
以為可以為所欲為
thinking he gonna do what he want to do,

1221
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:00,480
不聽我的說話
irregardless of what I say.

1222
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,710
Bono, 聽著, 我離開理事長的辦公室後
Look here, Bono, I left the commissioner's office

1223
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:04,180
去了A&P那裏
and went down to the A&P.

1224
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:06,620
那小子根本沒在那工作, 他跟我說謊了
That boy ain't workin' down there, he lied to me.

1225
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:09,890
說他取回了工作, 週末得上班什麼的
Tellin' me he got his job back, tellin' me he workin' weekend,

1226
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:11,620
說他課後在上班
tellin' me he workin' after school.

1227
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,820
Stawicki說他根本沒來上班
Mr. Stawicki says he ain't working down there at all.

1228
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,000
Cory只是長大了而已
Cory just growing up.

1229
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:17,490
他有了自己的想法, 不能再聽你說的
He just bustin' at the seams, tryin' to fill out your shoes.

1230
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:18,670
我才不在意他想什麼
I don't care what he doing.

1231
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,760
當他到了反叛期
When he get to the place where he want to disobey me,

1232
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:23,900
那就是出外打拼的時候了, Bono也懂
then it's time for him to move on. Bono will tell you that.

1233
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,740
我肯定他不能違抗他父親後
I bet he ain't never disobeyed his daddy

1234
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,770
不用受罰
without paying the consequences.

1235
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,940
我根本沒機會違抗他
I ain't never had the chance.

1236
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:33,780
我父親到處走, 我根本沒看過他
My daddy came on through, but I ain't never knew him to see him.

1237
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:36,580
或者他在想什麼, 去哪了
Or what he had on his mind, or where he went.

1238
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:40,450
就四海為家, 尋找新大陸
Just moving on through. Searching out the new land.

1239
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,550
那就是以前的人用的
That's what the old folks used to call it.

1240
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,890
一個人要是到處搬, 不停換女人
See a fella moving around from place to place, woman to woman,

1241
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:49,560
他們叫這"尋找新大陸"
they call it "searching out the new land."

1242
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,030
我也不清楚他有沒有找到
I can't say if he ever found it.

1243
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,560
我來到這地方, 也不想有孩子
I come along, didn't want no kids.

1244
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,830
我也不知道我能否安定下來
I didn't know if I was gonna be in one place long enough

1245
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,900
當個爸爸
to fix on 'em right as their daddy.

1246
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,200
我想不如還是尋找新大陸算了
I figured I was going searching, too.

1247
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:03,570
沒想過我跟Lucille在一起的時間
As it turn out, I been hooked up with Lucille

1248
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,910
也幾乎有你爸爸和Rose在一起那麼久了
for near about as long as your daddy been with Rose.

1249
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:08,210
已經16年了
Going on 16 years.

1250
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:09,980
有時候我真希望自己不認識我的父親
Sometimes, I wish I'd never known my daddy.

1251
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:13,950
他不在意孩子過得怎樣, 對他來說毫不重要
He ain't cared nothing about no kids. A kid to him wasn't nothing.

1252
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:17,650
他只想你快點成人
All he wanted you to do was learn how to walk,

1253
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:18,830
好讓你能去工作賺錢給他
so he could start you to working.

1254
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:23,030
吃飯時, 他總先吃, 你只吃他剩下的
Come to eating, he ate first. Anything left over, that's what you got.

1255
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:26,500
他會吃掉所有東西, 而你只分到那麼一點
Man would sit down, eat two chickens, and give you the wing.

1256
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,700
爸, 別胡說了, 天下父母都會讓子女吃飽
You ought to stop that, pop. Everybody feed their kids.

1257
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,840
不管時勢有多艱難, 天下父母都疼愛子女
No matter how hard times is, everybody care about their kids.

1258
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,040
確保他們三餐溫飽
Make sure they have something to eat.

1259
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,940
我父親唯一在意的
Only thing my daddy cared about

1260
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,810
就是叫我們搬那一卷卷的棉花給Lubin先生
was getting them bales of cotton in to Mr. Lubin.

1261
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:39,910
那是他唯一在意的事
That's the only thing that mattered to him.

1262
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:42,250
以前我都在想他為何還活著
Sometimes, I used to wonder why he was still living,

1263
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,950
為何魔鬼還沒帶走他
why the devil hadn't come and got him.

1264
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:46,950
快把棉花搬到Lubin先生那
"Get them bales of cotton in to Mr. Lubin."

1265
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:48,580
後來才知道我父親欠Lubin錢
Find out he owe him money.

1266
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:49,720
當他知道此地不宜久留時
He should have just went on and left

1267
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,750
他就該跑路
when he saw he couldn't get nowhere.

1268
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:51,930
至少我會那樣做
That's what I would've done.

1269
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,860
他怎留下11個孩子就走? 還有走去哪?
How he gonna leave with 11 kids? And where he gonna go?

1270
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:57,990
他只懂耕作, 他根本無路可逃
He ain't knew nothing but how to farm. No, he was trapped.

1271
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,730
我想他也知道, 但我也會為他說一句...
I think he knew it, too. But I'll say this for him...

1272
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:03,630
他覺得他有責任照顧我們
He felt a responsibility toward us.

1273
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,700
雖然不像我預期一樣體貼
May not have treated us like I felt he should have,

1274
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,670
但他要是沒有良心
but without that responsibility,

1275
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:09,710
大可以留下我們, 自己跑路
he could have run off and left us,

1276
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:10,970
再另起爐灶
made his own way.

1277
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,610
很多人也這樣
A lot of them did.

1278
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:14,040
你說你父親的那一代嗎?
Back in those days, what you talkin' about?

1279
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,880
他們每天離開房子
They walk out their front door

1280
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,080
無論多日曬雨淋, 都在街上一直走
and take off down one road or
another and just keep on walkin'.

1281
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,080
對, 這才像話
There you go. That's what I'm talkin' about.

1282
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:24,720
一直走到他們遇到下一間房子
Just keep on walking till they come to something else.

1283
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,990
你沒聽過大遷徙嗎? [一戰時黑人從美國南部遷北]
Ain't you never heard of nobody having the walking blues?

1284
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:30,760
那就是你叫那些跑路的人
Now, that's what you call it when you just take off like that.

1285
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:34,660
我父親不是你說的那種
My daddy ain't had no walking blues. What you talking about?

1286
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:36,030
他留下來了
He stayed right there with his family,

1287
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,900
但他壞事做盡
but he was just as evil as he could be!

1288
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:44,740
我媽媽接受不了他和他的性格
My mama couldn't stand him. Couldn't stand that evilness.

1289
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,780
我8歲時她就離開了
She run off when I was about eight.

1290
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:50,910
她有一晚靜悄悄的走, 跟我說她會回來
She sneaked off one night, told me she was coming back for me.

1291
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,780
自那我就再沒有見過她
I ain't never seen her no more.

1292
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:56,950
他有過的女人終究都會離開他, 他不是個好人
All his women run off and left him. He wasn't good for nobody.

1293
00:54:57,590 --> 00:54:59,060
輪到我離家的時候
My turn come to head out.

1294
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,660
我當時14歲
I was 14,

1295
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:03,660
跟Joe Canewell的女兒打得火熱
got to sniffing around Joe Canewell's daughter.

1296
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:07,100
我們家有只老騾子叫Greyboy
We had this old mule called "Greyboy".

1297
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,630
我父親叫我出去耕作
My daddy sent me out to do some plowing.

1298
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:13,100
讓我有機會跟Joe Canewell的女兒談談情
I got to fooling around with Joe Canewell's daughter.

1299
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:16,670
我們找到了一個隱蔽的地方撫摸大家
Found us a nice spot, got real cozy with each other.

1300
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:19,840
她當時13歲, 所以我們都知道大家發育了
She was about 13, so we done figured we grown anyway.

1301
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,110
我們在溪河附近, 互相撫摸
So, we were down there by the creek, enjoying ourselves,

1302
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,810
把正事都放一邊
ain't thinking about nothing.

1303
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,080
怎料綁著Greyboy的繩子鬆開了
Didn't know Greyboy had gotten loose,

1304
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:29,750
它跑回家裏, 我父親就知道事有蹊蹺
wandered back to the house, and my daddy was lookin' for me.

1305
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:33,620
他找到我們時, 看到我們還在撫摸大家
So, we down there enjoying ourselves when he come up on us.

1306
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,730
我們不知所措
Surprised us.

1307
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:38,130
他拿著騾子身上的皮帶
Had them leather straps off that mule,

1308
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:41,360
開始不停地打我
commenced to whupping me like there was no tomorrow.

1309
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:44,030
我站起來, 當時心感侮辱又憤怒
I jump up. I'm mad, embarrassed.

1310
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,970
又很害怕他
I was scared of my daddy.

1311
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:49,010
他開始打我時
Now, when he commenced to whipping on me,

1312
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:50,870
很自然地我就逃跑吧
quite naturally, I run to get out of the way.

1313
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,710
我想他是因為我沒有完成工作而生氣
Now, I think he's mad 'cause I ain't done my work.

1314
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:56,150
但我看到他故意讓我落跑
But I see where he's chasing me off,

1315
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:58,180
然後想去獨佔這個女孩
so he can have the gal for himself.

1316
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:01,920
當我想透了
When I see what the matter of it was,

1317
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:06,990
我變得不再害怕他, 自那, 我成為了一個男人
I lost all fear of my daddy, and right there, I became a man.

1318
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:09,660
才14歲
Fourteen years of age.

1319
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,660
是時候輪到我作主了
Now, it's my turn to run him off.

1320
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,400
我拿起他剛才用的皮帶
I picked up them same reins he used on me.

1321
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,030
然後開始打起他來
I picked up them reins, I commenced to whupping on him.

1322
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,270
那女孩落荒而逃
Gal jump up, she run off.

1323
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,710
當他轉過來看著我時
When he turned to face me,

1324
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:26,680
我終於知道為何魔鬼沒有帶走他
I knew why the devil never come and get him

1325
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,840
因為他就是魔鬼
'cause he was the devil himself.

1326
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:32,750
我忘了之後發生什麼了
I don't know what happened.

1327
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:35,950
我醒過來, 躺在溪河旁
I woke up, laying there by the creek,

1328
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:39,790
我們養的老狗Blue, 他在舔我的臉
and Blue, this old dog we had, he was licking my face.

1329
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:42,890
我的雙眼腫極了
Both my eyes were swoll shut.

1330
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:44,830
我以為我瞎了, 什麼都看不到
I thought I was blind, I couldn't see nothing.

1331
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:48,700
就躺在那裏哭
I just laid there and cried.

1332
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,010
我也不知道該怎辦
And I didn't know what I was gonna do.

1333
00:56:57,010 --> 00:57:01,710
但我知道是時候離家出走了
But I knew the time had come for me to leave my daddy's house.

1334
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:05,110
突然間我感覺到世界之大
Suddenly, the world got big, and...

1335
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:12,120
費了我很多時間才弄清楚
It was a long time before I could cut it down to where I could handle it.

1336
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:16,790
弄清楚的期間, 我發現
Part of that cutting down was where I got to the place

1337
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:18,830
其實他在我心底下, 在怒吼著想出來
where I could feel him kicking in my blood,

1338
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:20,230
而我和他之所以不同
and I knew the only thing that separated us

1339
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:22,770
只是我們不是生於同一個時代而已
was a matter of a few years.

1340
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,000
Gabe叔叔, 你在吃什麼?
What you got there, Uncle Gabe?

1341
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:29,470
我在吃火腿三明治
I got me a ham sandwich.

1342
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:31,840
Rose給我弄了火腿三明治
Rose gave me a ham sandwich.

1343
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,250
除了Gabriel外, 我沒再聯繫家裏的人
I lost touch with everybody except Gabriel.

1344
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:42,250
但...
But...

1345
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,920
我希望他已經死了
I hope he's dead.

1346
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:54,860
我希望他能找到點安慰
I hope he found some peace.

1347
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:57,030
真是個沉重的故事, 爸
That's a heavy story, pop.

1348
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:02,100
我都不知道你14歲就離家了
I didn't know you left home when you was 14.

1349
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:04,170
14歲太早獨立了
Fourteen's kinda young to be on your own.

1350
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,180
要是我的話真不知道該怎辦
I don't know what I would've done.

1351
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:09,850
我在那溪河站了起來, 向莫比爾出發
Well, I got up from that creek, walked on down to Mobile.

1352
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:13,520
我不想再耕作了, 我想我在城市會找到更好的工作
I was through with farming.
I figured I'd do better in the cities.

1353
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,320
所以我徒步走了200英里到莫比爾
So, I walked the 200 miles to Mobile.

1354
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,990
等下, 你才沒有徒步走200英里, 爸
Wait a minute, you ain't walked no 200 miles, pop.

1355
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,190
沒有人想這樣做
Ain't nobody gonna walk no 200 miles.

1356
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:23,230
那是段很長的距離啊!
You talking about some walking there!

1357
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:26,100
以前唯一到其他地方的方法就是徒步
That's the only way you got anywhere back in them days.

1358
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:29,060
媽的, 我會選擇搭便車
Shit! Damn if I wouldn't have hitched a ride with somebody.

1359
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:30,870
哪來的便車?
Who you gonna hitch it with?

1360
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:32,840
那時候才沒有現在的車和科技
There ain't no cars and things like they got now.

1361
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,270
當時是1918年
We talking about 1918.

1362
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:36,070
你們在這裏聊什麼?
What you all out here gettin' into?

1363
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:38,240
我跟Lyons說他現時的生活比以前好多了
I'm telling Lyons how good he got it.

1364
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,840
他根本不知道我在說什麼
He don't know nothing about this I'm talking.

1365
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,140
Lyons, 剛才Bonnie打來了
Lyons, that was Bonnie on the phone.

1366
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:42,550
她說你約好了去接她下班
She says you supposed to pick her up.

1367
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:44,280
知道了, Rose
Yeah, okay, Rose.

1368
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:47,120
我到了莫比爾
I walked on down to Mobile,

1369
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,550
搭了駛向這邊來的人便車
hitched up with some fellows that was coming up this way.

1370
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,190
到了才發現
Got up here and found out,

1371
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:53,960
不但找不到工作
not only could you not get a job,

1372
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,360
也找不到住處
you couldn't find no place to live.

1373
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,290
我以為自己自由了
I thought I was in freedom.

1374
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,960
有色人種都住在裏弗班克 [加州城市]
Colored folks living down there on the Riverbanks

1375
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:03,170
隨便哪裏都好
in whatever kind of shelter they could find for themselves.

1376
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:05,900
有些在橋下睡
Right down there under the Brady Street Bridge.

1377
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:09,370
有些在自己用木條和瀝青紙搭建的帳篷睡
Living down there in shacks made out of sticks and tar paper.

1378
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:12,210
那時候我都要崩潰了
Messed around down there.

1379
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:14,940
無惡不作, 開始偷竊
Went from bad to worse. Started stealing.

1380
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:17,350
開始時是食物, 然後我想到偷錢
First, it was food. Then I figure I steal me some money,

1381
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:20,120
可以買食物, 鞋等
I can buy me some food, buy me some shoes, too.

1382
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:22,180
一樣接一樣, 最後遇見你的媽媽
One thing led to another. Met your mama.

1383
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:24,990
當時還小, 急著想成為個男人
I was young, anxious to be a man.

1384
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,960
我遇到你媽媽後有了你, 怎辦了?
I met your mama and had you. Why'd I do that for?

1385
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,260
我得多養兩人
Now, I got to worry about feeding you and her.

1386
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:32,030
得要偷更多才行
Got to steal three times as much.

1387
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:36,170
我有一天在外面, 想著對誰下手
I went out one day looking for somebody to rob.

1388
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:37,430
對, 我當時是個小偷
That's what I was, I was a robber.

1389
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:39,970
我不會隱瞞
I'mma tell you the truth.

1390
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:42,000
直至今天我還是心感慚愧, 但那是事實
I'm ashamed of it today, but it's the truth.

1391
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:44,940
我找到目標, 掏出了我的小刀
I went to rob this fella, I pull out my knife.

1392
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:47,080
他拿出了槍, 想也不想就射在我胸口上
He pulled out a gun, shot me in the chest.

1393
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,240
那感覺
It felt like somebody had taken

1394
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:50,280
就像有人拿著灼熱的鐵塊烙印在我身上
a hot branding iron and laid it on me.

1395
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,350
他射了我之後, 我跳上前以小刀還擊
Now, when he shot me, I jumped at him with my knife,

1396
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:57,220
他們說我殺了他
and they say I killed him.

1397
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:59,290
讓我坐了15年監牢
Locked me up, put me in the penitentiary for 15 years.

1398
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:00,960
我在裏面認識了Bono
That's where I met Bono.

1399
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:03,630
學會了打棒球
Where I learned how to play baseball.

1400
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:05,230
出來後才發現你媽媽帶走了你
Got out that place, and your mama had taken you,

1401
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:07,260
在一個沒有我的環境下繼續生活
went on to make a life without me.

1402
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,370
15年是段很長的時間
Fifteen years was a long time for her to wait.

1403
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:12,370
但那15年讓我改正了
But that 15 years cured me of that robbing stuff.

1404
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:13,000
Rose會告訴你
Rose'll tell you.

1405
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,240
我再遇到她時, 她問我
I first met her, she ask me if I had

1406
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,370
是否已經將那無知改掉了
gotten all that foolishness out of my system.

1407
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,310
我說: 寶目, 只剩你和棒球
I said, "baby, it's you and baseball,

1408
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:21,210
對我來說是重要的, 聽到嗎, Bono?
"all what count to me." You hear me, Bono?

1409
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:24,010
而我也真的那樣想, 她說: 哪樣較重要?
And I meant it, too. She said, "which one come first?"

1410
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:27,120
我說: 當然是棒球
I said, "well, ain't no doubt it's baseball.

1411
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:29,150
但要是你留下來和我白頭到老
"But you stick and get old with me,

1412
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:30,920
我們的愛會比對棒球的愛更長壽
"and we'll both outlive this baseball."

1413
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,060
我說對了嗎, Rose?
Am I right, Rose?

1414
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:35,690
那是真的
And it's true.

1415
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,320
老兄, 閉嘴吧, 你才沒有說過
Man, hush your mouth. You ain't say no such thing.

1416
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:39,700
你當時說"寶貝你知道你永遠都是最重要的"
Talkin' about, "baby, you know you'll always be number one with me."

1417
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:42,330
那才是你所說的
That's what you was talking.

1418
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:44,300
那就是為何我那麼愛這個女人
That's why I love this woman.

1419
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:45,670
Rose總會提醒你
Rose will keep you straight.

1420
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,200
如果你誤入歧途, 她總會提醒你
You get off the track, she'll straighten you up.

1421
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,870
Lyons, 你快點去接Bonnie
Lyons, you better get on up and get Bonnie.

1422
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:50,110
她在等你呢
She waiting on you.

1423
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,180
- 嘿, 爸   - 什麼?
- Hey, pop.   - Yeah?

1424
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:54,540
你應該來看看我表演
You ought to come down to the grill, hear me play.

1425
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,110
老兄, 我才不去
Oh, man, I ain't goin' down there.

1426
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:57,450
我太老了, 不適合到俱樂部
I'm too old to be hanging out in them clubs.

1427
01:00:57,450 --> 01:01:01,020
你得很出色才能在[酒吧和]烤肉店演出
You got to be good to play down at the grill.

1428
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:02,420
來吧, 爸
Come on, pop.

1429
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:03,950
我明天還得早起
I got to get up in the morning.

1430
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,320
你不用待到很晚
Well, you ain't gotta stay long.

1431
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:11,090
不了, 我打算吃了晚餐就去睡
No, I'm gonna eat my supper and go to bed.

1432
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:15,100
那我走了, 下次見
Well, I got to go. I'll see you later.

1433
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:20,970
你別在我的發薪日出現
Don't you come by my house on my payday!

1434
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:23,270
還有下次來先打電話, 讓別人知道
And pick up the phone, let somebody know you coming,

1435
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:25,310
也帶上Bonnie, 你知道我很想見她
and bring Bonnie, you know I'm always glad to see her.

1436
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:29,040
好的, Rose, 保重
I'll do that, Rose. You take care now.

1437
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:30,410
- 下次見, 爸   - 好吧
- See you, pop.    - All right.

1438
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:32,480
再見, Bono先生
See you, Mr. Bono.

1439
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,120
再見, Gabe叔叔
See you, Uncle Gabe!

1440
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,750
Lyons! 萬獸之王!
Lyons! King of the jungle!

1441
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,450
晚餐好了嗎, 女人?
Supper ready, woman?

1442
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:39,990
我們有點事要做
Me and you got some business to take care of.

1443
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:42,220
- 我會讓你爽翻天   - Troy, 我說過了
- I'mma tear it up, too.   - Troy, I done told you now!

1444
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:44,190
天啊, 女人, 是Bono而已, 他就像家人一樣
Oh, hell, woman, it's Bono. Bono like family.

1445
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,400
我已經認識這朋友...
I done know this nigger since...

1446
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,100
- 我認識你多久了?   - 很久了
- How long have I known you?  - It's been a long time.

1447
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,430
我自Skippy還是小朋友的時候就認識這朋友 [應為電影]
I done known this nigger since Skippy was a pup!

1448
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,370
經歷了不少日子
Me and him done been through some times!

1449
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:55,200
你說對了
You sure are right about that.

1450
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:57,270
我認識他甚至比認識你還長, Rose
Hell, I known him longer than I known you, Rose,

1451
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:59,210
至今我們還是好朋友
and we still standin' shoulder to shoulder.

1452
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:02,510
夫復何求啊Bono
Look here, Bono, a man can't ask for no more than that.

1453
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:04,080
我愛你, 朋友
I love you, nigger.

1454
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,080
天啊別來這套, 我也愛你
Oh, hell! I love you, too.

1455
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:09,150
但我得回去, 你在這裏能見你的女人
But I got to get home, see my woman. You got yours in hand.

1456
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:11,050
我得回去才能見到她
I got to go get mine.

1457
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:14,730
你為何這樣做, 爸?
What you do that for, pop?

1458
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:16,760
Cory, 什麼事了?
What's the matter? Cory, what's the matter?

1459
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,130
爸到學校跟Zellman教練說
Pop done went up to the school and told Coach Zellman

1460
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:19,290
我不能繼續打美式足球
I can't play football no more.

1461
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,060
也不讓我比賽和練習
Wouldn't even let me play the game.

1462
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,430
他告訴教練叫球隊負責人別來找他
Told him to tell the recruiter not to come.

1463
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:24,370
- Troy.   - 你叫我做什麼?
- Troy.   - What you Troying me for?

1464
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:26,100
對, 我的確做了, 那小子知道原因
Yeah, I did it. And the boy knows why I did it.

1465
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:28,100
你為何要這樣對我? 那是我唯一的機會啊!
Why you wanna do that to me? That was the one chance I had!

1466
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:29,470
讓Cory打美式足球又沒什麼問題, Troy
Ain't nothing wrong with Cory playing football, Troy.

1467
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:30,440
那小子欺騙了我
The boy lied to me.

1468
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:33,340
我跟那臭小子說過: 你想繼續打
I told the nigger, "you want to play football,

1469
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:34,310
就得繼續完成家務
"you keep up with your chores

1470
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:37,350
繼續在A&P工作, 那就是條件
"hold that job down at the A&P." That was the conditions.

1471
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,520
我去過Stawicki先生那裏...
I stopped down to see Mr. Stawicki...

1472
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:41,550
賽季期間我下課後不能去工作, 爸
I can't work after school during the football season, pop.

1473
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:44,090
我跟你說過Stawicki先生會為我留著位置
I tried to tell you Mr. Stawicki was holding my job for me.

1474
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:45,690
你從不聽別人說話
You don't never want to listen to nobody,

1475
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,530
然後就替我自作主張?
and then you wanna go and do this to me?

1476
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,460
我沒對你做什麼, 這全都是你自找的
I ain't done nothin' to you. You done it to yourself.

1477
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:50,130
就因為你以前沒有機會!
Just 'cause you didn't get a chance!

1478
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:52,230
你只是害怕我會比你有成就, 僅此而已!
You're just scared I'm gonna be better than you, that's all!

1479
01:02:57,830 --> 01:02:59,230
- 來這   - Troy
- Come here.   - Troy.

1480
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,070
Troy.
Troy

1481
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:09,210
撿起它
Pick it up.

1482
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:19,660
戴上它
Put it on.

1483
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,400
系隱
Strap it up.

1484
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:36,370
好了, 聽著
All right. See

1485
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,640
你犯了個錯誤
You done made a mistake.

1486
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:42,410
- 我什麼都沒做   - 我來告訴你
- I didn't even do nothing - I'll tell you what your mistake was.

1487
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:46,620
你揮棒了, 但你沒打中球
You swung at the ball and you didn't hit it.

1488
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:50,490
那是第一振, 你現在在打擊區
That's strike one. You in the batter's box now.

1489
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:53,620
你揮棒但沒打中, 明白了嗎?
You swung and you missed, see?

1490
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:56,290
那是第一振
That's strike one.

1491
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:02,260
你最別被三振
Don't you strike out.

1492
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:36,460
Cory, 你何不進來
Cory, why don't you come on in here,

1493
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:38,290
幫我清潔一下杯櫃?
help me clean out these cupboards?

1494
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:41,530
我不會退出球隊的, 我不在意爸爸說什麼
I ain't quitting the team. I don't care what papa says.

1495
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:43,700
他回來後我會跟他商討的
I'll talk to him when he get back.

1496
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:45,530
他得去看你叔叔Gabe
He had to go see about your Uncle Gabe.

1497
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:46,970
警察又拘捕了他
Police done arrested him again.

1498
01:05:46,970 --> 01:05:48,640
說他擾亂秩序
Said he was disturbing the peace.

1499
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,310
他很快回來
He'll be back directly.

1500
01:05:50,310 --> 01:05:52,710
進來幫我刷刷杯櫃
Come on in here and help me clean out these cupboards.

1501
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:54,310
來吧
Come on.

1502
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:06,460
Troy, 他們怎說了
Troy, what they say down there?

1503
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:09,730
沒說什麼, 我給了他們$50, 他們就讓他走了
They ain't said nothing. I give them $50, they let him go.

1504
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:11,690
晚點再跟你說
I'll talk to you about it.

1505
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:12,670
Cory在哪?
Where Cory?

1506
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:15,360
他在裏面幫我清潔杯櫃
He in the house, helping me clean out these cupboards.

1507
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:17,370
那去叫他出來這裏
All right, tell him to get his butt out here.

1508
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,670
他們只想要錢
All they want is the money.

1509
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:24,010
我去接他回來已經六七次了
This makes six, seven times, I done went down there and got him.

1510
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:26,380
他們大老遠看到我來, 就已經伸出手向我拿錢
See me coming, they stick out their hands.

1511
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:29,280
我明白, 他們只在意錢
Yeah, I know what you mean.
That's all they care about, that money.

1512
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,410
不在意對錯
They don't care about what's right.

1513
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:37,290
傻子, 你為何拿了硬木材回來?
Nigger, why you got to go and get some hardwood?

1514
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:39,520
你只不過是築個藩籬而已
You ain't doing nothin' but building a little old fence.

1515
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,560
去找些松木, 那才是你需要的
Get you some soft pinewood. That's all you need.

1516
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:43,360
我知道自己在做什麼, 這才是用在室外的木材
I know what I'm doing. This outside wood.

1517
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,560
松木是用在室內的
You put pinewood inside the house.

1518
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:48,630
松木是室內用的, 這些是室外的
Pinewood inside wood. This here the outside wood.

1519
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:50,800
告訴我, 籓籬要建在哪?
Now tell me, where the fence gonna be?

1520
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:54,270
你不需用上這種木材
You don't need this wood.

1521
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:56,300
你可以用松木建
You can put it up with pinewood,

1522
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:58,070
那籓籬會比你更長壽
and it'll stand as long as you gonna be here looking at it.

1523
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,610
你怎知道我何時死, 朋友?
How you know how long I'm gonna be here, nigger?

1524
01:06:59,610 --> 01:07:01,440
天啊, 我可能長生不老呢
Hell, I might live forever.

1525
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:04,080
我會比那老頭Horsely活得久
I'll live longer than old man Horsely.

1526
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,780
Magee以前也總是這樣說
That's what Magee used to say.

1527
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:08,380
Magee是個大傻子, 你告訴我誰會
Ah, Magee a damn fool. Now you tell me who you ever heard of

1528
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:11,520
用生銹的鉗子替自己拔牙?
gonna pull their own teeth with a pair of rusty pliers?

1529
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:12,490
他們是老一輩的人
They're old folks.

1530
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,620
我祖父以前也用鉗子拔牙
My granddaddy used to pull his teeth with pliers.

1531
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:16,760
以前沒有牙醫會為有色人種服務
They ain't had no dentists for colored folk back then.

1532
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,530
至少用清潔的鉗子吧, 懂嗎?
Well, get clean pliers. You understand? Clean pliers.

1533
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:21,930
先消毒, 再者, 今非昔比了
Sterilize them. Besides, we ain't living back then.

1534
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:25,430
他只需要到Goldblum牙醫就行了
All he had to do was go down to Doc Goldblum's.

1535
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,870
我看到你和那來自塔拉哈西的女孩, Alberta
I see where you and that Tallahassee gal, that Alberta,

1536
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:30,570
看到你們老在一起
see where you all done got tight.

1537
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:31,740
什麼意思?
What you mean, "got tight"?

1538
01:07:31,770 --> 01:07:34,080
我看到你經常和她打鬧
I see where you be laughing and joking with her all the time.

1539
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:36,780
我跟每個人也是這樣做, 你懂我的, Bono
I laugh and joke with 'em all. Bono, you know me.

1540
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:38,850
不是平常那種打鬧
Ain't the kind of laughing and joking I'm talking about.

1541
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:42,080
Bono先生, 你好嗎?
How you doing, Mr. Bono?

1542
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:43,790
Cory, 拿起Bono手中的木鋸開始工作
Cory, get that saw from Bono and cut some wood.

1543
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:46,460
他說木材太硬很難鋸斷
He talking about wood too hard to cut.

1544
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:48,490
退後點, Jim
Go on. Stand back there, Jim.

1545
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:49,490
讓那小子展示給你看
Let the young boy show you how it's done.

1546
01:07:49,890 --> 01:07:51,690
無任歡迎
He's sure welcome to it.

1547
01:07:55,670 --> 01:08:00,440
看他壯得像Joe Louis一樣 [職業拳擊手]
Look at that. Big, ol' strong boy, looks like Joe Louis.

1548
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:02,870
天啊, 我真的老了
Hell, I must be getting old

1549
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,910
看到他工作才感到歲月不饒人
the way I'm watching that boy whip through that wood.

1550
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:07,680
我真不懂為何媽媽想要在後院築起籓籬
I don't see why mama wants a fence around no yard no way.

1551
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:08,750
我也想知道
Damn if I know, either.

1552
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:10,850
我不知道她在提防什麼
I don't know what the hell she keeping out with it.

1553
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:12,910
她又沒什麼別人想要的東西
She ain't got nothing nobody wants.

1554
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:16,150
有些人建籓籬來提防外面的人
Some people build fences to keep people out,

1555
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:18,620
有些人則用來讓圍欄內的人留住
and other people build fences to keep people in.

1556
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:21,790
Rose想要留住你們, 她太愛你們了
Rose wants to hold on to you all. She loves you.

1557
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,590
朋友, 我不需要別人來提醒我我的妻子愛我
Hell, nigger, I don't need nobody to tell me my wife loves me.

1558
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,130
Cory, 進去找找看有沒有另一把木鋸
Cory, go in the house and see if you can find the other saw.

1559
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:30,800
在哪?
Where's it at?

1560
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,770
我說找找看, 看到你找到為止
I said find it. Look for it till you find it.

1561
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:39,880
把圍欄內的人留住是什麼意思?
What is that supposed to mean? Want to keep us in?

1562
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:55,690
Troy
Troy,

1563
01:08:55,690 --> 01:08:59,900
我幾乎大半輩子都認識你
I done known you seem like damn near my whole life.

1564
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:02,800
你和Rose兩個都是, 認識很久了
You and Rose both. I known both of you all for a long time.

1565
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,500
我還記得當初你遇見Rose的時候
I remember when you met Rose.

1566
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:09,570
以前你在公園打棒球時
When you was hitting them baseball out of the park.

1567
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:11,940
很多女孩都追求你
A lot of them old gals was after you then.

1568
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,940
你簡直是萬人迷
You had the pick of the litter.

1569
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:17,810
當你選了Rose, 我很替你高興
When you picked Rose, I was happy for you.

1570
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:21,950
那是第一次我覺得你有點理智
That's the first time I knew you had any sense.

1571
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:25,520
我想: 我的好朋友Troy知道他想要的
I said, "my man Troy knows what he's doing.

1572
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,660
我會跟著他, 他可能會帶我到前所未到過的地方
"I'm gonna follow this nigger, he might take me somewhere."

1573
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:30,930
而我真的跟著你了
I been following you, too.

1574
01:09:30,930 --> 01:09:34,730
我學到了一大堆關於因果的事
I done learned a whole heap of
things about life watching you.

1575
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:39,530
學到了哪些是屎
I done learned how to tell where the shit lies.

1576
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:41,770
哪些是苜蓿 [分辨是非]
How to tell it from the alfalfa.

1577
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:44,910
你教了我很多事
You done learned me a lot of things.

1578
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:47,740
教我不要重蹈覆轍
Showed me how to not make the same mistakes.

1579
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:49,880
不要一步登天
To take life as it come along,

1580
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:52,750
一步一步的來
keep putting one foot in front of the other.

1581
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,650
Rose是個好女人, Troy
Rose is a good woman, Troy.

1582
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:55,820
我知道
I know she a good woman.

1583
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:57,450
我跟她結婚18年了
I've been married to her for 18 years.

1584
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,920
你到底想說什麼, Bono?
What you got on your mind, Bono?

1585
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:01,490
我只是說她是個好女人, 沒別的
I just say she's a good woman, like I say anything.

1586
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:02,790
我不必暗示什麼
I ain't got to have nothing on my mind.

1587
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:04,130
你就拋出一句她是個好女人
You just say she a good woman and leave it

1588
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,500
然後沒有下文?
hanging out there like that?

1589
01:10:05,530 --> 01:10:06,850
你為何突然說她是個好女人?
Why are you telling me she a good woman?

1590
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,500
她愛你, Troy
She loves you, Troy. Rose loves you.

1591
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:10,570
你說我不配嗎?
You saying I don't measure up?

1592
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,670
我認為那就是你想說的
That's what you tryin' to say.

1593
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:13,800
我不配她因為我在和別的女人在外面
I don't measure up 'cause I'm seeing this other gal.

1594
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:14,940
我知道你暗示什麼
I know what you tryin' to say.

1595
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:17,270
我知道Rose對你來說有多大意義
I know what Rose means to you, Troy.

1596
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:20,510
我只是想說我不想看見你對她不忠
I'm just tryin' to say I don't want to see you mess up.

1597
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:23,610
我明白
Yeah.

1598
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:29,890
感謝你
Well, I appreciate that, Bono.

1599
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:33,560
如果你對Lucille不忠
If you was messing around on Lucille,

1600
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,690
我也會跟你說同一番話
I'd be telling you the same thing.

1601
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:37,060
那就是我要說的了
That's all I got to say.

1602
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:41,060
我會說是因為我愛你們兩個
I just say that 'cause I love you both.

1603
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:44,100
對
Oh. Yeah.

1604
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:47,640
你懂我的為人, 我沒在外面拈花惹草
You know me. I wasn't out there looking for nothing.

1605
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:50,010
我肯定你不會找到比Rose更好的女人
You can't find a better woman than Rose, I know that.

1606
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:54,070
但看來Alberta總黏著我
But it seems like this woman just stuck on to me

1607
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:54,610
我怎說她都不肯離開
where I can't shake her loose.

1608
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:56,040
我試過跟她吵架或者避開她
I done wrestled with it and tried to throw her off,

1609
01:10:56,050 --> 01:10:58,750
但她反倒更纏著我了
but now she stuck on tighter.

1610
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:00,980
而現在她打算這輩子跟定我了
And now she stuck on for good.

1611
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:03,890
你總是告訴我你有分寸
You's in control. That's what you tell me all the time.

1612
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:05,750
你會對你做過的事負責任
You responsible for what you do.

1613
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,660
我沒在逃避責任
I ain't ducking the responsibility of it.

1614
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:09,990
只要問心無愧就可以了
As long as it set right in my heart, then I'm okay.

1615
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:12,990
因為那是我的宗旨, 它會告訴我是非對錯
'Cause that's all I listen to. It tell me right and wrong every time.

1616
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,960
而我也沒說要對Rose不忠
And I ain't talking about doing Rose no bad turn.

1617
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:16,630
我愛她
I love Rose.

1618
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:18,030
她跟我這麼久了
She done carried me a long ways,

1619
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,670
我為此而愛她, 尊重她
and I love and respect her for that.

1620
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:20,640
我知道
I know you do.

1621
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:22,970
那就是為什麼我不想看到你傷害她
That's why I don't want to see you hurt her.

1622
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:25,640
但要是她發現了怎辦?
But what you gonna do when she finds out?

1623
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,980
你到時候會剩下什麼?
What you got then?

1624
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:29,640
你腳踏兩隻船
You try to juggle both of them,

1625
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:31,350
早晚也得二捨其一
sooner or later, you gonna drop one of them.

1626
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:33,720
- 那是常識   - 我明白, Bono
- That's common sense. - I know what you're saying, Bono.

1627
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,350
我一直在想辦法
I been trying to figure a way to work it out.

1628
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:39,650
盡快, Troy
Work it out right, Troy.

1629
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:42,120
我不是想對你們的家事指指點點
I ain't trying to get all up between you and Rose's business,

1630
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:44,660
但趁事情還沒轉壞前趕快解決
but work it, so it come out right.

1631
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:46,900
那我來介入你們的家事
Hell, I get all between you and Lucille's business.

1632
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:48,600
你打算何時買
And when you gonna buy that woman

1633
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,900
她一直想要的冰箱?
that refrigerator she be wanting?

1634
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:51,770
別告訴我你沒錢
And don't tell me you ain't got no money.

1635
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:52,840
我知道誰替你打理財務
I know who your banker is.

1636
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:55,700
錢該花在Lucille的冰箱上而不是放在梅隆銀行內
Mellon don't need that money as bad as Lucille wants that refrigerator.

1637
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:56,780
我很清楚
I know that.

1638
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:57,810
- 告訴你吧   - 什麼?
- Tell you what I'll do.   - What?

1639
01:11:57,810 --> 01:11:59,980
當你為Rose建成籓籬時
When you finish building this fence for Rose,

1640
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:01,810
我就給Lucille買冰箱
I'll buy Lucille that refrigerator.

1641
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:04,750
你會後悔的
You done stuck your foot in your mouth now.

1642
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:07,380
朋友, 你要去哪?
Hey, nigger, where you going?

1643
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:08,820
我得回家
I'm going home.

1644
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:10,720
你不是在想我會幫你吧
I know you don't expect me to help you now.

1645
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:12,090
我得保住我的錢
I'm protecting my money.

1646
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:15,690
我想看你一個人慢慢的建
I want to see you put that fence up by yourself.

1647
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:17,130
那就是我想看的
That's what I want to see.

1648
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:19,690
沒有我的幫忙, 六個月後你仍然毫無頭緒
You'll be here another six months without me.

1649
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:20,960
朋友, 那樣不對啊
Nigger, you ain't right.

1650
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,830
當談到我的錢
When it come to my money,

1651
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:25,930
我就像國慶日的煙火一樣對[好]
I'm right as fireworks on the Fourth of July.

1652
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:27,400
等著瞧
We gonna see.

1653
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,100
你準備去提款吧!
You better get out your bank book!

1654
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:23,160
他們在警局在說了什麼? Gabe怎了?
What they say down there? What's happening with Gabe?

1655
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:26,190
我過去接回他了, 花了我五十塊
I went down there and got him out. Cost me $50.

1656
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,900
說他在擾亂秩序
Said he was disturbing the peace.

1657
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,200
法官三周後審訊
Judge set up a hearing for him in three weeks

1658
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,000
他為何不被重新分配到醫院內
to show cause why he shouldn't be recommitted.

1659
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,870
那你怎說? 你怎跟法官說的
What'd you say? What'd you tell the judge?

1660
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,910
我跟他說我會照顧他
I told him I'd take care of him.

1661
01:13:36,910 --> 01:13:38,470
沒有理由又分配他住醫院
It didn't make no sense to recommit the man.

1662
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:39,970
他伸出他那貪婪的手
He stuck out his big greasy palm,

1663
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:42,780
跟我說交出$50然後帶他回家
told me to give him $50 and take him on home.

1664
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:44,780
那他現在在哪?
Where's he at now? Where'd he go off to?

1665
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:46,780
又到處亂跑了, 他不想別人拖著他的手
Gone about his business. He don't need nobody to hold his hand.

1666
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:49,020
我也不知道, 但那看來是最好的選擇
Well, I don't know, seem like that would be the best place for him.

1667
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:50,050
讓他住在醫院裏
To put him in a hospital.

1668
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,190
我知道你接下來要說什麼
I know what you say gonna say,

1669
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:52,820
但那正是我認為這樣做是對的原因
but that's what I think would be best.

1670
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:54,460
那他在打仗時失去的一切, 為了什麼?
Man had his life ruined fighting for what?

1671
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:55,890
現在他們想把他鎖起來?
Now, they want to take him and lock him up?

1672
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:58,190
該給他自由啊, 他又沒打擾誰
Let him be free. Man ain't bothering nobody.

1673
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:02,060
我想每個人都有不同的看法
Everybody got their own way of looking at it, I guess.

1674
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:03,470
來拿你的午餐吧
Come on, get your lunch.

1675
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:05,100
我這裏有些棉豆和玉米麵包
I got some lima beans and cornbread in the oven.

1676
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:06,270
快去, 你得吃點什麼
Come on, get somethin' to eat.

1677
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,040
在這裏煩惱Gabe的事也沒幫助
Ain't no sense in you fretting over Gabe.

1678
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,210
Rose, 我有點事要跟你說
Rose, I got something to tell you.

1679
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:12,210
- 待我把食物放好再說   - Rose...
- Wait till I put the food on the table. - Rose...

1680
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,010
我不知道該怎開口
Now, I don't know how to tell you this.

1681
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:21,950
但又不能瞞著你
And I can't explain it none.

1682
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:25,120
[好感]就那麼一點點的積聚啊
It just sort of grows on you.

1683
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:29,190
開始時就像小木灌
It started off like a little bush,

1684
01:14:29,190 --> 01:14:30,830
待你發現時已經是整片森林了
next thing you know, it's a whole forest.

1685
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:32,060
Troy, 你在說什麼?
Troy, what is you talking about?

1686
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:33,960
我在說話, 女人, 讓我把話說完
I'm talking, woman. Let me talk.

1687
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,930
我在跟你說
I'm trying to tell you,

1688
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:38,230
我在找個隱晦的方法跟你說...
find a way to tell you that...

1689
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:45,870
我要成為父親了
I'm gonna be a daddy.

1690
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:50,150
對, 我要成為別人的父親了
Yeah, I'm gonna be somebody's daddy.

1691
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:57,520
Troy, 不是真的吧? 你要成為什麼?
Troy, you ain't telling me this. You're gonna be what?

1692
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,990
- 你要成為別人的父親?   - Rose...
- You're gonna be somebody's daddy?   - Rose...

1693
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:00,090
你竟然跟你的妻子說這個?
You're telling your wife this?

1694
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:01,160
現在...
Now...

1695
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:03,530
嗨, Troy, 嗨, Rose
Hey, Troy! Hey, Rose!

1696
01:15:03,530 --> 01:15:06,160
我等了18年就為了聽你說這些事嗎?
I got to wait 18 years to hear something like this?

1697
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,800
嗨, Rose
Hey, Rose.

1698
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:11,930
我有朵花送給你
I got a flower for you.

1699
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:18,070
那是朵玫瑰花, 就像你的名字一樣
That's a rose. The same rose like you is.

1700
01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:24,310
謝了, Gabe
Thanks, Gabe.

1701
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:25,980
Troy, 你沒在生我的氣吧?
Troy, you ain't mad at me?

1702
01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:28,010
那些壞人抓了我回來
Them bad mens come and put me away.

1703
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:30,020
- 你沒在生我的氣吧?   - 沒, 我沒有生氣
- You ain't mad at me?   - No. No, I ain't mad at you.

1704
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:32,020
18年了, 你竟然做得出這種事?
Eighteen years, and you want to come with this?

1705
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:34,860
看我拿到了什麼? 一個全新的25美分
See what I got? Got a brand-new quarter.

1706
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:38,760
Rose, 只是...
Rose, it's just that...

1707
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:41,030
你沒什麼可以說, 也不用解釋
Ain't nothing you can say, Troy. Ain't no explaining it.

1708
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:43,900
給我這25美分的人還有一大堆
The fella that give me this quarter had a whole mess of 'em!

1709
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:46,230
我要留著它直到它暗啞無光
I'm gonna keep this quarter till it stops shining.

1710
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:49,040
Gabe, 出去前門等我, 我冰箱裏有西瓜
Gabe, go on up front now.
I got some watermelon in the frigidaire.

1711
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:50,210
快去, 我待會拿給你
Go on. I'll get you a piece.

1712
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:53,040
Rose, 聽我說, 我當時在追趕地獄之犬
Say, Rose, you know, I was chasing hellhounds,

1713
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:56,040
然後那些壞人把我抓回去鎖起來了
and them bad mens come and get me and take me away.

1714
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:58,110
Troy救了我, 他來了並跟他們說
Troy helped me. He come down there and told them

1715
01:15:58,110 --> 01:16:01,120
他們最好在他打跨他們之前放了我
they better let me go before he beat them up!

1716
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:02,290
他真的說了
Yeah, he did!

1717
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,920
出去吧, Gabe, 我待會給你西瓜
Go up front now, Gabe. I'll get you some watermelon.

1718
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:06,250
那些壞人都走了
Them bad men is gone now.

1719
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:08,920
好吧, Rose要給我西瓜
Okay. Rose gonna give me some watermelon,

1720
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:11,290
有條紋的那種
the kind with the stripes on it.

1721
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:18,230
為什麼, Troy?
Why, Troy?

1722
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:21,040
為什麼?
Why?

1723
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:26,940
過了那麼多年, 你現在跟我說這些?
After all these years, you come dragging this in to me now?

1724
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:29,110
你這年紀, 不應該會做的
It don't make no sense at your age.

1725
01:16:29,610 --> 01:16:33,650
我可以理解你十年或者十五年前這樣做, 但不是現在
I could've expected this 10, or 15 years ago, but not now.

1726
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:36,120
年齡與此沒有關係, Rose
Age ain't got nothing to do with it, Rose.

1727
01:16:40,090 --> 01:16:43,320
我做了一個妻子該做的
I done tried to be everything a wife should be.

1728
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:46,930
一個妻子可以做的所有事
Everything a wife could be.

1729
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,130
我結婚整整18年了
I've been married 18 years,

1730
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:50,630
而現在竟到了你說
and now, I got to live to see the day you tell me

1731
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:54,240
你和別的女人有了孩子的一天
you been seeing another woman and done fathered a child by her.

1732
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:11,350
你明知道我不喜歡同父異母什麼的
And you know I never wanted no half-nothing in my family!

1733
01:17:14,290 --> 01:17:15,660
我整個家庭都是這樣
My whole family is half.

1734
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:17,430
每個人都有不同的父母親
Everybody got different fathers and mothers

1735
01:17:17,430 --> 01:17:19,190
我的幾個兄弟姊妹都是這樣
and my two sisters and my brothers.

1736
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:21,000
你根本不知道誰是誰生的
You could hardly tell who's who.

1737
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,660
永遠不能好好談談父母的話題
Could never sit down and talk about papa and mama.

1738
01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:25,330
因為大家的父母都不一樣
It was always your papa, your mama, my papa, my mama.

1739
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:28,100
我從不想我的孩子們也是這樣
And I ain't never wanted that for none of my children!

1740
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:29,340
然而現在, 你竟然過來
And now, you want to drag your behind in here

1741
01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:30,510
跟我說這些事!
and tell me something like this!

1742
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:33,470
夠了, 你有權利知道的, 是時候了
Stop it now. You ought to know. It's time for you to know.

1743
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:34,380
我才不想知道, 媽的!
Well, I don't want to know, god damn it!

1744
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:55,300
Rose?
Rose?

1745
01:17:58,430 --> 01:18:02,100
我不能讓她墮胎, 米已成炊了
I just can't make it go away. It's done now.

1746
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:06,170
我沒法改變事情
I can't wish the circumstances of the thing away.

1747
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:08,740
你也不想改變
And you don't want to, either.

1748
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:10,510
或許你想我們兩母子離開
Maybe you want to wish me and my boy away.

1749
01:18:10,510 --> 01:18:12,180
也許那就是你想的
Maybe that's what you want.

1750
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:14,720
你不能這樣做
Well, you can't wish us away.

1751
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,750
我把我的18年放在你身上了
I got 18 years of my life invested in you.

1752
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:19,020
你該留在我們的床上而不是出去鬼混
You ought to have stayed upstairs in my bed where you belong.

1753
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:21,460
聽著, 我們可以處理好這事
Now, listen to me. We can get a handle on this thing.

1754
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:23,590
我們可以說清楚, 有共識
We can talk this out, come to an understanding.

1755
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:24,760
突然間此事就是關於"我們"
All of a sudden it's "we."

1756
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:26,190
當你在外面
Where was "we" at when
you were down there,

1757
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,760
跟那個可惡的女人鬼混時"我們"在哪裏?
rolling around with some godforsaken woman?

1758
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,000
"我們"該在你做傻事之前
"We" should've come to an understanding

1759
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,430
就要有共識!
before you started making a damn fool of yourself!

1760
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:32,100
當說到共識時
You're a day late and a dollar short

1761
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:33,400
你總是遲了
when it comes to an understanding with me.

1762
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:39,310
Rose, 只是因為她能給我完全不同的感覺
Rose, it's just that she...gives me a different idea.

1763
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:43,080
完全不同的自我理解
A different understanding about myself.

1764
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:46,450
讓我可以在這裏走出去時, 放下所有壓力
I can step out of this house and get away from the pressures

1765
01:18:46,450 --> 01:18:48,080
和問題, 變成一個完全不同的人
and the problems, be a different man.

1766
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,020
我不用擔心如何修好屋頂
I ain't got to worry about how I'll get the roof fixed,

1767
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:51,490
或者付錢, 或者...
or pay the bills, or...

1768
01:18:51,490 --> 01:18:53,120
我可以
I can just

1769
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:57,460
成為一個我前所未有過的自己
be a part of myself I ain't never been before.

1770
01:18:58,530 --> 01:19:01,060
我想知道的是...
What I want to know is...

1771
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:06,070
我想知道的是
What I want to know

1772
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:08,540
你是否打算繼續見她?
is do you plan to continue seeing her?

1773
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:11,170
那就是你可以說的
That's all you can say to me.

1774
01:19:12,270 --> 01:19:14,110
我在她的家裏能放鬆下來
I could sit up in her house and laugh.

1775
01:19:14,110 --> 01:19:16,380
你明白嗎?
You understand what I'm saying?

1776
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:19,180
我可以放聲笑, 而那感覺真好
I could laugh out loud, and it feels good.

1777
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:21,380
簡直好到了我心底裏
It reaches all the way down to the bottom of my shoes.

1778
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:22,580
Rose, 我...
Rose, I...

1779
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:28,090
我不想放棄那些
I can't give that up.

1780
01:19:33,530 --> 01:19:35,830
那或許你該繼續留在她那裏
Well, maybe you ought to go on and stay down there with her,

1781
01:19:35,830 --> 01:19:37,530
如果她真是比我更好的女人的話
if she's a better woman than me.

1782
01:19:37,530 --> 01:19:39,400
這不是關於誰是更好的女人的問題
It ain't about nobody being a better woman, or nothing.

1783
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:40,470
Rose, 你盡責了
Rose, you ain't to blame.

1784
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,270
做妻子的話你簡直是不二之選
A man couldn't ask for a better wife than you've been.

1785
01:19:43,270 --> 01:19:44,780
這事我得負起所有責任
I'm responsible for it.

1786
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,810
我每天重複做著同樣的事
I done locked myself into a pattern,

1787
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:48,480
照顧你們, 都讓我忘了自己了
trying to take care of you all, that I forgot about myself.

1788
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,280
我不是一直在你背後嗎?
Well, what the hell was I there for?

1789
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:51,850
那是我的工作, 不是他人的
That was my job, not somebody else's.

1790
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:55,150
Rose, 聽著, 我竭盡所能去過正當的生活
Rose, listen to me. I done tried all my life to live decent.

1791
01:19:55,150 --> 01:19:58,150
一個正當, 努力向上的生活
To live a clean, hard, useful life.

1792
01:19:58,150 --> 01:20:01,320
我盡了力去成為一個好丈夫
I try to be a good husband to you, in every way I know how.

1793
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:03,490
可能我一開始就錯了吧, 我不知道
Maybe I come into the world backwards, I don't know,

1794
01:20:03,490 --> 01:20:07,130
但你就像上場前已經被二振了一樣
but you're born with two strikes on you before you come to the plate.

1795
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,200
你得把任何事都看管好
You got to guard it closely,

1796
01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:10,870
老是擔心突發事情
always looking for the curveball on the inside corner.

1797
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:12,530
你不能讓任何事不受你控制
You can't afford a called strike.

1798
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:14,170
你不能讓任何事漏掉
You can't let nothing get past you.

1799
01:20:14,170 --> 01:20:16,300
要是你倒下了, 你還不死心
If you're going down, you're doing down swinging.

1800
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:19,210
所有事都像對著你干一樣
Everything lined up against you!

1801
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:22,310
你還想怎樣?
What you gonna do?

1802
01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:26,350
我贏了他們, Rose, 我短打了 [犧牲]
I fooled them, Rose. I bunted.

1803
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:30,520
當我有你和Cory和份有點像樣的工作, 我很安全
When I found you and Cory and a halfway decent job, I was safe.

1804
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:32,850
沒什麼可以拖累我了
Couldn't nothing touch me!

1805
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:34,420
我不會再被三振出局
I wasn't gonna strike out no more.

1806
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:35,860
不會再回去坐牢
I wasn't going back to the penitentiary.

1807
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:38,330
不會再喝醉, 睡在街上
I wasn't gonna lie in the street with a bottle of wine.

1808
01:20:38,330 --> 01:20:42,600
我安全了, 我有個家庭, 有份工作
I was safe. I had me a family, a job.

1809
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:46,500
我不會被三振的
I wasn't gonna get that last strike.

1810
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:51,270
我站在一壘
I was standing on first base,

1811
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:54,310
等著回到本壘
waiting for one of them boys to
knock me in, to bring me home.

1812
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:55,180
你該留在我們的床上, Troy
You should have stayed in my bed, Troy.

1813
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:57,210
然後我看到那女子, 她讓我膽大起來
Then I saw the gal, she firmed up my backbone.

1814
01:20:57,210 --> 01:20:59,580
我在想如果我努力點, 或許可以盜壘
I got to thinkin' that if I tried, maybe I could steal second.

1815
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:01,380
- 你明白嗎?   - 你該抱緊我
- You understand what I'm saying? - You should've held me tight.

1816
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:03,680
你該捉緊我的手
You should've grabbed me and held on.

1817
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:04,620
我站在一壘18年了
I stood on first base for 18 years,

1818
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:07,260
然後我想, 管他的, 豁出去
and I thought, well, god damn it, go on for it!

1819
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:09,590
我們不是在說棒球啊!
We ain't talking about baseball!

1820
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:12,190
我們在說你跟別的女人鬼混
We talking about you going off and laying up with another woman,

1821
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,230
然後把這事帶回家跟我說
then bringing it home to me.

1822
01:21:13,230 --> 01:21:14,360
那才是我們要討論的
That's what we're talking about.

1823
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:17,470
- 我們不是要談棒球!   - Rose, 你沒細心聽
- We're not talkin' about no baseball! - Rose, you're not listening to me.

1824
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,630
我在用我最擅長的東西去表達
I'm trying to explain it to you the best way I know how.

1825
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:22,800
對我來說很難去接受
It's not easy for me to admit

1826
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,670
我站在原地18年了這事實
that I've been standing in the same place for 18 years!

1827
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:28,410
我也跟你一起站在原地啊!
Well, I've been standing with you!

1828
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:32,480
我一直都跟你站在原地, Troy! 我也有我的人生
I've been right here with you, Troy! I got a life, too.

1829
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:36,680
我為此付出了我的18年啊
I gave 18 years of my life to stand in the same spot as you!

1830
01:21:36,690 --> 01:21:38,720
你沒想過我也想要做其他事?
Don't you think I ever wanted other things?

1831
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:41,220
沒想過我也有我的夢想和願望?
Don't you think I had dreams and hopes?

1832
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:43,660
那我的生命呢? 那我呢?
What about my life? What about me?

1833
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:45,260
你以為我沒有想過
Don't you think it ever crossed my mind

1834
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:46,430
去認識其他男人?
to want to know other men?

1835
01:21:46,430 --> 01:21:49,200
或者一走了之
That I wanted to lay up somewhere

1836
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,700
忘了我的職責?
and forget about my responsibilities?

1837
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:52,500
或者我想有過人讓我笑
That I wanted someone to make me laugh,

1838
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:54,570
讓我快樂?
so I could feel good?

1839
01:21:54,570 --> 01:21:56,670
你不是唯一一個有需求的人
You're not the only one who's got wants and needs.

1840
01:21:56,670 --> 01:21:58,670
但我留下來了, Troy
But I held on to you, Troy.

1841
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:03,210
我把我的所有情感, 需求和夢想
I took all my feelings, my wants and needs and dreams,

1842
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:04,950
埋藏在你的心底下
and I buried them inside you.

1843
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:07,380
我把種子埋藏好, 每天看著它, 祈望它成長
I planted a seed and watched and prayed over it.

1844
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:10,420
我把自己埋藏在你心內然後等待開花!
I planted myself inside you and waited to bloom!

1845
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:12,290
但那花了我18年時間
And it didn't take me no 18 years

1846
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:14,390
才知道那泥土原來如石頭般硬
to realize the soil was hard and rocky,

1847
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:16,490
還有它根本不會開花!
and it wasn't never gonna bloom!

1848
01:22:16,490 --> 01:22:19,490
但我仍然捉緊你, 我把你捉得更緊
But I held on to you, Troy. I held you tighter.

1849
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,560
你是我的丈夫
You was my husband.

1850
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:24,370
我該給你我的全部
I owed you everything I had.

1851
01:22:24,370 --> 01:22:27,240
我的每一部分
Every part of me I could find to give you.

1852
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:30,970
當晚上我在樓上的睡房時
And upstairs in that bedroom, with the darkness falling in on me,

1853
01:22:30,970 --> 01:22:35,310
我用盡力氣消除那個疑慮
I gave everything I had to try and erase the doubt

1854
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:37,780
那個其實你不是個好男人的疑慮
that you wasn't the finest man in the world.

1855
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:40,650
無論你打算去哪裏, 我都會跟著你
And wherever you was going, i was gonna be there with you,

1856
01:22:40,650 --> 01:22:43,380
因為你是我的丈夫
because you was my husband.

1857
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:47,660
因為這樣做我才能繼續做你的妻子
'Cause that's the only way I was gonna survive as your wife.

1858
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:51,330
你經常說給什麼
You always talking about what you give

1859
01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:52,630
還有你不能給什麼
and what you don't have to give.

1860
01:22:53,330 --> 01:22:55,000
但你也會拿取, Troy
But you take, too, Troy.

1861
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,670
你會拿取而且不在乎是誰付出的
You take and don't even know nobody's giving.

1862
01:22:57,670 --> 01:22:59,730
你說我好逸惡勞
You say I take and don't give.

1863
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:00,910
- Troy, 你弄痛我了   - 你說我好逸惡勞
- Troy, you're hurting me.   - You say I take and don't give.

1864
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:02,400
- Troy, 我的手很痛, 放手!   - 我給了我能給的
- Troy, you're hurting my arm, let go!
- I gave you everything I got.

1865
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:03,470
別說我沒有
Don't you tell that lie on me.

1866
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:04,770
- 媽媽!   - 別說我沒有
- Mama!   - Don't you tell that lie!

1867
01:23:04,770 --> 01:23:06,540
Troy, 我弄痛我了!
Troy, you're hurting me!

1868
01:23:07,010 --> 01:23:08,510
Troy! Troy!
Troy! Troy!

1869
01:23:08,710 --> 01:23:12,550
好了, 那是二振
All right. That's strike two.

1870
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:17,590
你別再惹我, 你最好別三振
You stay away from around me, boy. Don't you strike out.

1871
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:21,390
你滿球數了
You're living with a full count.

1872
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:26,630
你最好別三振!
Don't you strike out!

1873
01:26:46,930 --> 01:26:48,900
Troy, 我想跟你說點事
Troy, I want to talk to you.

1874
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,770
突然間?
All of a sudden?

1875
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:58,040
過了這麼久你想跟我說點事?
After all this time, you want to talk to me, huh?

1876
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,740
你數個月來沒跟我說過一句話
You ain't wanted to talk to me in months.

1877
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:02,010
昨晚也沒有
You ain't wanted to talk to me last night.

1878
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:03,740
你那時可不想理會我
You didn't want no parts of me then.

1879
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:06,510
現在你想來說什麼?
What you want to talk to me about now?

1880
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:11,590
明天是星期五
Tomorrow's Friday.

1881
01:27:11,590 --> 01:27:12,890
我知道
I know what day tomorrow is.

1882
01:27:12,890 --> 01:27:14,920
你以為我不知道嗎?
You think I don't know tomorrow's Friday?

1883
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:17,590
我的整生, 都在等星期五的來臨
My whole life, I ain't done nothing but look to see Friday coming,

1884
01:27:17,590 --> 01:27:18,260
你還來提醒我
and you got to tell me it's Friday.

1885
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:19,590
我想知道你會否回家
I want to know if you're coming home.

1886
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:22,600
我每天都回家, 你知道的
I always come home, Rose. You know that.

1887
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:23,860
沒有一晚我是沒回來的
Ain't never been a night I ain't come home.

1888
01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:25,800
你明知道那不是我的意思
That ain't what I mean, and you know it.

1889
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:29,270
我想知道你下班後會否直接回家
I wanna know if you're coming straight home after work.

1890
01:27:29,270 --> 01:27:32,310
我想我會兌換支票, 然後在Taylor的酒吧和他們喝點酒
I figured I'd cash my check,
hang out at Taylors' with the boys.

1891
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:33,580
或許玩一局[西洋]跳棋
Maybe play a game of checkers.

1892
01:27:33,610 --> 01:27:36,080
Troy, 我不能再繼續這樣, 我接受不了
Troy, I can't live like this. I won't live like this.

1893
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,750
自那之後你就人在心不在
You're living on borrowed time with me.

1894
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:39,780
六個月以來, 你都沒真正回來
Been going on six months now, you ain't been coming home.

1895
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:41,880
我每晚都回來, 一年來從沒間斷過
I come home every night. Every night of the year.

1896
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:44,620
那就整整365天
That's 365 days.

1897
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:48,690
我想你明天下班後直接回家
I want you to come home tomorrow after work.

1898
01:27:53,630 --> 01:27:57,100
Rose, 你知道我不會亂花錢
Rose, I don't mess up my pay. You know that.

1899
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:59,070
我收到工資後就全數交給你
I take my pay, i give it to you.

1900
01:27:59,070 --> 01:28:02,740
我只拿著你分配給我的部份
I don't have no money but what you give me back.

1901
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:05,910
我只想要一點私人時間而已
I just want a little time to myself.

1902
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:07,070
去享樂一下
A little time to enjoy life.

1903
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:09,040
那我呢? 何時才輪到我去享樂?
What about me? When's my time to enjoy life?

1904
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:11,310
我不知道還可以說什麼, 我已經盡力了
I don't know what to tell you, Rose. I'm doing the best I can.

1905
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:12,680
你下班回家後
You ain't been comin' home from work,

1906
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:13,880
只換件衣服又出去了
but time enough to change your clothes and run out.

1907
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:15,950
你叫那盡力嗎?
You wanna call that the best you can do?

1908
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:20,720
我晚點得去醫院看Alberta
I'm going over to the hospital to see Alberta.

1909
01:28:21,690 --> 01:28:23,360
她今天下午進了醫院
She went into the hospital this afternoon.

1910
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:26,890
看來是早產
Looks like she might have the baby early.

1911
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:29,600
我不會去太久
I won't be gone long.

1912
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:37,710
你該知道他們今天到了Pearl小姐那裏
Well, you ought to know. They went over to Miss Pearl's

1913
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:38,880
帶走了Gabe
and got Gabe today.

1914
01:28:38,910 --> 01:28:42,810
她說你叫他們鎖起他來
She said you told them to go ahead and lock him up.

1915
01:28:42,810 --> 01:28:46,850
我才沒有說過, 你被她騙了
I ain't said no such thing. Whoever told you that is telling a lie.

1916
01:28:46,850 --> 01:28:48,720
Pearl小姐撒了個很大的謊
Miss Pearl ain't doing nothing but telling a big, fat lie.

1917
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:50,680
她不用說出口, 我在文件上看到的
She ain't had to tell me. I read it on the papers.

1918
01:28:50,690 --> 01:28:52,820
- 那份文件說了什麼?   - 說你叫他們去帶走他
- What'd it say, huh?   - It said you told them to take him.

1919
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:54,340
那他們肯定弄錯了
Oh, well, then they screwed that up,

1920
01:28:54,370 --> 01:28:55,860
就像他們弄錯其他事一樣
just like they screw up everything.

1921
01:28:55,890 --> 01:28:56,920
我才不在意他們在文件上說了什麼
I ain't worried about what they got on that paper.

1922
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:58,390
說政府會把他的部分財產交給醫院作照顧費用
It say the government sends part of the check to the hospital,

1923
01:28:58,460 --> 01:28:59,560
另一部份交給你
the other part to you.

1924
01:28:59,590 --> 01:29:02,130
我跟此事毫無關係
I ain't got nothing to do with that, if that's the way it works.

1925
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:02,630
我也沒叫他們分給我
I don't make up the rules...

1926
01:29:02,630 --> 01:29:03,830
你對待Gabe就像你對待Cory一樣差勁
You did Gabe just like you did Cory.

1927
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:05,030
你不會替Cory簽署
You wouldn't sign the paper for Cory,

1928
01:29:05,030 --> 01:29:06,830
但你卻替Gabe簽了, 是你簽的!
but you signed for Gabe! You signed that paper!

1929
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,800
我說過我沒有簽署過什麼, 女人
I told you I ain't signed nothing, woman.

1930
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,370
天啊, 我只簽了份釋放同意書
Hell, the only thing I signed was the release form.

1931
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:11,840
我又不識字
Hell, I can't read,

1932
01:29:11,870 --> 01:29:12,910
天知道他們在同意書上寫了什麼
I don't know what they had on that paper.

1933
01:29:12,910 --> 01:29:14,840
我才沒簽過什麼送走Gabe的文件
I ain't signed nothing about sending Gabe away.

1934
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:17,040
我當時說送他到醫院, 你說要讓他自由
I said send him to the hospital, you said let him go free.

1935
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:18,220
現在你反過來
Then you went down there

1936
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:20,380
同意送他到醫院, 就為了他的錢
and you signed him to the hospital for half his money.

1937
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:20,950
這是自相矛盾, Troy
You went back on yourself, Troy.

1938
01:29:20,950 --> 01:29:22,980
你會有報應的
You're gonna have to answer for that.

1939
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:23,820
你才跟Pearl小姐說過話
You just been over there talking to Miss Pearl.

1940
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:25,120
她只是因為不能再
She just mad 'cause she ain't gettin'

1941
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,390
騙Gabe的錢而生氣, 所以胡說而已
Gabe's rent money, that's all it is.

1942
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:28,320
Troy, 我親眼看著你簽的!
Troy, I seen where you signed the paper!

1943
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:29,090
你才沒有!
You ain't seen nothing I signed!

1944
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:31,930
那她家裏為何又有我弟弟的文件?
And what she doing got papers on my brother for, anyway?

1945
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:35,730
Pearl小姐只是在撒謊
Miss Pearl ain't doing nothing but telling a big, fat lie,

1946
01:29:35,730 --> 01:29:37,700
我會去跟她對質!
and I'm gonna tell her about it, too!

1947
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:46,010
我沒有簽署過什麼!
You ain't seen nothing I signed!

1948
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:48,080
還說我...
Say...

1949
01:29:49,910 --> 01:29:52,080
我沒有簽署過什麼!
You ain't seen nothing I signed!

1950
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:50,260
Troy.
Troy.

1951
01:31:52,530 --> 01:31:54,130
Troy.
Troy.

1952
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:02,210
那是醫院打來說Alberta生下來了
That was the hospital. Alberta had the baby.

1953
01:32:03,550 --> 01:32:06,210
是嗎? 是男還是女的?
Yeah? What she have? What is it?

1954
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:08,950
是個女孩
It's a girl.

1955
01:32:11,550 --> 01:32:13,190
我...
I...

1956
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:18,360
我該去看她一下
I better get on down there to see her.

1957
01:32:20,190 --> 01:32:20,200
Troy.
Troy.

1958
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:24,260
- Troy   - 我總得去看她一下吧, Rose
- Troy. - I got to go see her now, Rose. That's only right.

1959
01:32:29,370 --> 01:32:33,010
怎麼了? 嬰兒什麼有問題嗎?
What's the matter? Baby all right, ain't it?

1960
01:32:36,110 --> 01:32:39,210
Alberta產後死去了
Alberta died having the baby.

1961
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:42,350
你說她死了?
She died? You say she's dead?

1962
01:32:45,390 --> 01:32:47,020
她死了?
Alberta dead?

1963
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:50,120
他們說盡了力, 他們...
They said they done all they could. They...

1964
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:53,060
他們對她無能為力
They couldn't do nothing for her.

1965
01:33:24,090 --> 01:33:27,060
那嬰兒呢? 她還好嗎?
Oh, what about the baby? Baby all right?

1966
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,060
他們說她很健康
They say it's healthy.

1967
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:34,900
我在想誰會替她辦身後事
I wonder who's gonna bury her.

1968
01:33:34,970 --> 01:33:36,070
她有家人的, Rose
She had a family, Rose.

1969
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:37,340
她不是無親無故
She wasn't living in the world by herself.

1970
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:39,940
我當然知道
I know she wasn't living in the world by herself.

1971
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:41,240
你下一樣想知道的就是她有沒有保險
Next thing you wanna know if she had any insurance.

1972
01:33:41,310 --> 01:33:42,510
你沒資格跟我這樣說話!
You ain't got to talk to me like that!

1973
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:44,980
你第一樣關心的就是: 誰會埋葬她?
First thing that jumped out your mouth. "Who's gonna bury her?"

1974
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:46,380
生怕我會付錢替她辦理
Like I'm finna take that task on for myself.

1975
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:48,450
我是你的妻子, 別推開我
I'm your wife. Don't push me away.

1976
01:33:48,450 --> 01:33:51,120
我沒有推開誰, 就給我點空間
I ain't pushing nobody away. Just give me some space.

1977
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:53,350
讓我靜一下
Just give me some room to breathe.

1978
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:25,550
好了, 死神先生
All right, Mr. Death.

1979
01:34:31,130 --> 01:34:34,030
我來告訴你接下來的事
I tell you what I'm gonna do.

1980
01:34:34,030 --> 01:34:36,430
我會繼續
I'm gonna take

1981
01:34:36,430 --> 01:34:40,500
在這後院築起籓籬, 知道嗎?
and build me a fence around this yard, see?

1982
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:45,710
我會築起籓籬保護屬於我的東西
I'm gonna build me a fence around what belongs to me.

1983
01:34:45,710 --> 01:34:49,040
然後我想你留在另一邊
And then I want you to stay on the other side.

1984
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:50,510
直至你準備好帶走我
You stay over there till you're ready for me,

1985
01:34:50,510 --> 01:34:52,310
到時候你就儘管來吧
then you come on.

1986
01:34:54,450 --> 01:34:58,250
帶上你的軍隊, 鐮刀, 披上你的袍子
Bring your army, bring your sickle, bring your wrestling clothes.

1987
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:00,420
這次我不會鬆懈
I ain't gonna fall down on my vigilance this time.

1988
01:35:00,420 --> 01:35:02,160
你不會...
You ain't gonna...

1989
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:07,390
你不會就有機可乘
You ain't gonna sneak up on me no more.

1990
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:11,330
當你準備好時
When you ready for me,

1991
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:13,730
當你手上的名單寫著Troy Maxson時
when the top of your list say Troy Maxson,

1992
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:16,070
到時候你就正面而來吧
then you come on up and knock on the front door.

1993
01:35:16,070 --> 01:35:18,070
其他人與此無關
Ain't nobody else got nothing to do with this.

1994
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:20,070
這是你我之間的事
This between you and me.

1995
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:24,410
男人之間!
Man to man!

1996
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:34,150
你在準備好帶走我之前留在籓籬的另一邊!
You stay on the other side of that fence till you ready for me!

1997
01:35:35,490 --> 01:35:38,230
然後隨時都可以
Then you come up and knock on that front door

1998
01:35:38,230 --> 01:35:42,100
與我正面對決!
anytime you want!

1999
01:35:54,110 --> 01:35:56,110
我拭目以待
I'll be ready for you.

2000
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,090
Rose?
Rose?

2001
01:36:49,230 --> 01:36:52,200
我在抱著我的女孩
I'm standing here with my daughter in my arms.

2002
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:54,270
聽著
Now,

2003
01:36:54,270 --> 01:36:57,340
她只不過是一個
she ain't but a wee,

2004
01:36:58,470 --> 01:36:59,870
初生的嬰兒而已
bitty little old thing.

2005
01:36:59,870 --> 01:37:02,310
她跟大人間的事沒有關係
She don't know nothing about grownfolk business.

2006
01:37:02,310 --> 01:37:03,710
她是無辜的
She innocent,

2007
01:37:05,850 --> 01:37:08,220
但她沒有母親
and she ain't got no mama.

2008
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:12,290
你為何告訴我這些, Troy?
What you telling me for, Troy?

2009
01:37:25,570 --> 01:37:27,400
那...
Well...

2010
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:31,440
我們在外面門廊好了
Guess we'll go sit out here on the porch.

2011
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:52,160
一個男人應該做他認為正確的事
A man's got to do what's right for him.

2012
01:37:55,530 --> 01:37:58,170
我毫不後悔我做過的事
I ain't sorry for nothing I done.

2013
01:37:59,530 --> 01:38:02,400
我內心感到那是對的事
It felt right in my heart.

2014
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:06,440
小寶寶在笑什麼?
What you smiling at?

2015
01:38:10,510 --> 01:38:13,310
你父親是個年紀老邁的好人
Your daddy's a great, big ol' man.

2016
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:20,620
無所畏懼, 但有時候也難免會害怕
Got these great big ol' hands, but sometimes he's scared.

2017
01:38:21,460 --> 01:38:24,790
而現在你父親正正在害怕
And right now, your daddy's scared 'cause we

2018
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:28,400
因為我們只能在這門廊坐著, 無家可歸
sitting out here on the porch and ain't got no home.

2019
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:30,460
我也試過居無定所
Oh, I've been homeless before.

2020
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:35,540
但我沒試過帶著嬰兒無家可歸
I ain't never had no baby with me, but I've been homeless.

2021
01:38:36,940 --> 01:38:40,340
就只是寂寞的在外面流連
You just be out there on the road by your lonesome

2022
01:38:42,310 --> 01:38:44,240
看著列車一架一架
and just see one of them trains coming by

2023
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:47,270
來了又走...
and just kinda go, say...

2024
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:18,610
她是我的女兒, Rose, 是我的...
She's my daughter, Rose, and my...

2025
01:39:20,450 --> 01:39:24,320
我的親生骨肉, 我不能遺棄她
My own flesh and blood. I can't deny her.

2026
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:27,520
就像我不能遺棄我的兒子們
No more than I can deny them boys.

2027
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:30,720
你們幾母子都是我的家人
You and them boys is my family.

2028
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:36,800
你們, 還有這孩子就是我唯一擁有的, 所以...
You, them, and this child is all I got in this world, so...

2029
01:39:39,470 --> 01:39:41,640
我想我要說的是
I guess what I'm saying is,

2030
01:39:46,570 --> 01:39:52,480
如果你能替我照顧她, 我會很感謝你
that I'd appreciate it if you was to help me take care of her.

2031
01:40:04,030 --> 01:40:05,590
好吧, Troy
Okay, Troy,

2032
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:09,400
你是對的
you're right.

2033
01:40:11,630 --> 01:40:13,870
我會替你照顧你的孩子
I'll take care of your baby for you.

2034
01:40:15,370 --> 01:40:17,340
因為如你所說
'Cause, like you say,

2035
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:21,310
她是無辜的
she innocent.

2036
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:26,310
總不能把父親的罪名降到孩子身上
You can't visit the sins of the father upon the child.

2037
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:32,450
況且單親孩子的日子會很艱難
Motherless child's got a hard time.

2038
01:40:54,110 --> 01:40:57,340
從今起, 這孩子有個母親了
From right now, this child's got a mother.

2039
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:05,890
但你是個寡夫
But you're a womanless man.

2040
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:17,920
大家都避開我
I'm coming in, everybody going out.

2041
01:42:17,930 --> 01:42:20,730
我得帶這蛋糕到教堂的蛋糕義賣
I'm taking this cake down to the church for the bake sale.

2042
01:42:20,730 --> 01:42:22,960
Lyons剛來過看你, 想要還你的二十塊
Lyons was by to see you. He stopped by to pay you your $20.

2043
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:24,630
錢就在桌上
It's laying right here on the table.

2044
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:25,700
拿著, 是我的工資
Well, here go this money.

2045
01:42:25,730 --> 01:42:27,670
放在桌上吧, Troy, 我晚點處理
Well, put it in there on the table, Troy. I'll get it.

2046
01:42:28,470 --> 01:42:29,500
你什麼時候回來?
What time you coming back?

2047
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:31,040
你在這裏問東問西也沒用
Ain't no use in you studyin' me.

2048
01:42:31,070 --> 01:42:32,610
我何時回來也沒關係
Don't matter what time I come back.

2049
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:33,840
我只是問一下而已, 女人, 現在都不給問了嗎?
I just asked you a question, woman. Can't I ask you a question?

2050
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:34,940
Troy, 我不想吵架
Troy, I don't want to get into it.

2051
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:36,610
你的餐在爐子裏
Now, your food is in there on the stove.

2052
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:37,780
翻熱一下就好了
All you got to do is heat it up.

2053
01:42:37,810 --> 01:42:40,650
還有別吃掉蛋糕
And don't be eating the rest of them cakes in there now.

2054
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:41,820
我還得用
I'm coming back for them.

2055
01:42:41,850 --> 01:42:44,020
明天下午也有蛋糕義賣
We're having a bake sale at the church tomorrow.

2056
01:42:58,850 --> 01:43:00,020
[工資]

2057
01:43:41,810 --> 01:43:42,980
嗨, Troy
Hey, Troy.

2058
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:44,840
怎了, Bono?
What's happening, Bono?

2059
01:43:44,850 --> 01:43:47,750
只是想來看看你
I just thought I'd stop by to see you.

2060
01:43:47,750 --> 01:43:49,620
你家裏沒人, 所以我猜...
Wasn't no one at the house, so I figured...

2061
01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:51,420
為什麼?
What you stop by to see me for?

2062
01:43:51,420 --> 01:43:53,820
你很久沒來看我了
You ain't stopped by in a month of Sundays.

2063
01:43:53,820 --> 01:43:55,760
天啊, 我肯定欠了你錢還是什麼的
Hell, I must owe you some money or somethin'.

2064
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:59,290
你還說, 自從你升職後我都快跟不上你了
Well, since you got your promotion, I can't keep up with you.

2065
01:43:59,290 --> 01:44:00,890
以前早晚都看到你
Used to see you every day.

2066
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:03,660
現在我甚至不知道你在哪工作
Now I don't even know what route you working.

2067
01:44:03,740 --> 01:44:04,840
他們老是調配我到不同地方工作
Keep switching me around.

2068
01:44:04,870 --> 01:44:09,000
現在我負責白人的街區
Got me out there in green tree now, hauling white folk garbage.

2069
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,870
- 白人街區嗎?   - 對
- Green tree, huh?   - Yeah.

2070
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:12,040
你真幸運
You lucky.

2071
01:44:12,070 --> 01:44:14,670
至少你不用搬垃圾
At least you ain't got to be lifting them barrels.

2072
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:16,840
該死的, 它們越來越重
Damn if they ain't getting heavier.

2073
01:44:16,850 --> 01:44:19,610
我再多工作兩年就退休了
I'm gonna put in my two years and call it quits.

2074
01:44:19,610 --> 01:44:21,680
對, 我也在想退休的事
Yeah, I'm thinking about retiring myself.

2075
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:23,950
你的工作輕鬆多了
Oh, you got it easy.

2076
01:44:23,950 --> 01:44:27,920
你可以再多駕駛五年啊
You could drive for another five years.

2077
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:29,090
那可不同, Bono
Ain't the same, Bono.

2078
01:44:29,590 --> 01:44:32,690
駕駛不像搬垃圾
It ain't like working the back of the truck.

2079
01:44:32,690 --> 01:44:36,700
只能獨自工作, 沒人聊天
You feel like you working by yourself. Ain't nobody to talk to.

2080
01:44:37,870 --> 01:44:40,770
不了, 還是退休吧, Lucille最近怎樣?
Naw, I'm thinking about retiring. How's Lucille?

2081
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:41,970
她很好
She all right.

2082
01:44:41,970 --> 01:44:45,040
她的關節炎有時候會復發
Her arthritis get to acting up on her sometimes.

2083
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:48,710
我過來時看到Rose, 她在教堂嗎?
Saw Rose on the way here. She going down to the church, huh?

2084
01:44:48,980 --> 01:44:50,780
對, 她過去了
Yeah, she took up going down there.

2085
01:44:50,780 --> 01:44:53,980
那些傳教士只想撈油水而已
All them preachers looking to fatten their pockets.

2086
01:44:53,980 --> 01:44:56,650
這裏有琴酒
Got some gin in here.

2087
01:44:56,650 --> 01:44:59,820
不了謝謝, 我只是來看看你
No, thanks. I just stopped in to say hello.

2088
01:44:59,820 --> 01:45:01,890
你也可以喝一杯啊朋友, 我從沒...
Well, you can take a drink, nigger. I ain't...

2089
01:45:01,890 --> 01:45:04,320
認識你以來從沒看過你不喝酒
I ain't never known you to say no to a drink.

2090
01:45:06,090 --> 01:45:07,330
你明天又不用上班
You ain't got to work tomorrow.

2091
01:45:07,330 --> 01:45:09,330
我只是來一下而已
I just stopped by.

2092
01:45:09,330 --> 01:45:11,360
我在想晚點到Skinner家裏
I'm thinkin' of going over to Skinner's.

2093
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:13,370
我們每星期五都會在他家裏玩多米諾骨牌
We got us a domino game going over his house every Friday.

2094
01:45:13,370 --> 01:45:15,030
朋友, 你才不會玩什麼多米諾骨牌
Nigger, you can't play no dominoes.

2095
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:17,970
我以前老是贏你
I used to whup you four games out of five.

2096
01:45:18,340 --> 01:45:22,710
我吸取了教訓, 我玩牌的技術在進步
Well, that learned me. I'm getting better.

2097
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:24,610
是嗎?
Yeah?

2098
01:45:31,350 --> 01:45:32,750
好吧
That's all right.

2099
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:37,660
我得走了
Look here, I got to be getting on.

2100
01:45:37,660 --> 01:45:38,930
有空來找我一下?
Stop by sometime, huh?

2101
01:45:38,930 --> 01:45:41,030
我會的, Bono
Yeah, I'll do that, Bono.

2102
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:47,870
Lucille跟Rose說你給她買了個新冰箱
Lucille told Rose you, uh, got her that new refrigerator.

2103
01:45:47,870 --> 01:45:52,370
對啊, Rose跟Lucille說你終於把籓籬建好了
Yeah. Rose told Lucille you had finally built your fence,

2104
01:45:52,370 --> 01:45:54,170
所以我想我們就扯平了
so, I figured we'd call it even.

2105
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:56,840
我就知道你信守承諾
I knew you would.

2106
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:57,910
是啊
Yeah.

2107
01:45:59,980 --> 01:46:01,180
好了
Okay.

2108

再見
I'll be talking to you.

2109
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:06,390
很高興看到你, Bono
Yeah, good to see you, Bono.

2110
01:46:06,390 --> 01:46:08,020
我有空會來找你的

2111
01:46:08,020 --> 01:46:10,020
好吧, Troy
Yeah. Okay, Troy.

[美國海軍陸戰隊招募署]

2113
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:39,510
我要進去
I got to get by.

2114
01:47:39,510 --> 01:47:40,910
你說什麼?
Say what? What you say?

2115
01:47:41,050 --> 01:47:43,320
你擋著我了, 我得進去

你得去哪?
You got to get by where?

2117
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:53,990
這是我付錢買的房子
This is my house. Bought and paid for.

2118
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,060
花了我15年之久, 如果你想進我的房子
Took me 15 years, and if you want to go in my house

2119
01:47:57,070 --> 01:47:59,030
而我坐在家門樓梯上的話, 你該說"請讓一下"
and I'm sitting on the steps, you say, "excuse me,"

2120
01:47:59,030 --> 01:48:00,300
就像你媽媽教你那樣
like your mama taught you.

2121
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:01,230
得了吧, 爸, 我得進去
Come on, pop, I gotta get by.

2122
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:02,540
你想就這樣無視我?
You just gonna walk over the top of me?

2123
01:48:02,540 --> 01:48:04,270
我也在這裏住的
I live here, too.

2124
01:48:04,270 --> 01:48:07,010
你想在我的地方無視我?
You just gonna walk over the top of me in my own house?

2125
01:48:07,010 --> 01:48:08,240
我不怕你
I ain't scared of you.

2126
01:48:08,540 --> 01:48:10,040
我沒在問你是否害怕我
I ain't asked you if you was scared of me.

2127
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:12,040
我是問你是否要在
I asked you was you finna walk over the top of me

2128
01:48:12,050 --> 01:48:13,780
我的地方無視我? 那才是我問的
in my own house? That was the question.

2129
01:48:13,780 --> 01:48:15,080
你不會說"請讓一下"
You ain't gonna say, "excuse me."

2130
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:16,250
你就這樣無視我
You just gonna walk over the top of me.

2131
01:48:16,250 --> 01:48:17,380
隨便你怎說
If you want to put it like that.

2132
01:48:17,390 --> 01:48:18,550
我怎說了?
How else am I gonna put it?

2133
01:48:18,550 --> 01:48:20,850
我是想繞過你進去
I was walking by you to go into the house,

2134
01:48:20,860 --> 01:48:22,520
因為你醉了, 在樓梯上唱歌
'cause you sitting on the steps drunk, singing to yourself.

- You can put it like that.   - Without saying, "excuse me"?

2136
01:48:29,860 --> 01:48:32,570
我問你了, 也不說"請讓一下"?
I asked you a question. Without saying, "excuse me"?

2137
01:48:32,570 --> 01:48:33,970
我不用對你客氣
I ain't got to say "excuse me" to you.

2138
01:48:33,970 --> 01:48:36,140
你在這個家裏不重要了
You don't count around here no more.

2139
01:48:38,540 --> 01:48:40,240
我懂了, 我在這裏不重要了
Oh, I see. I don't count around here no more.

2140
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:42,010
你也不用跟你的父親客氣了
You ain't got to say "excuse me" to your daddy.

2141
01:48:42,010 --> 01:48:44,840
突然間, 你就可以作主
All of a sudden, you done got so grown,

2142
01:48:44,850 --> 01:48:47,280
認為你父親在這裏不重要對吧?
where your daddy don't count around here no more, huh?

2143
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:49,050
在他辛勞工作才得以

買回來的地方嗎?

2145
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:53,950
突然間, 你就可以作主
All of a sudden, you done got so grown

2146
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:55,420
認為你父親在這裏毫無地位
that your daddy don't even count around here.

2147
01:48:55,420 --> 01:48:57,020
你要成為一家之主嗎?
What, you gonna take over?

2148
01:48:58,360 --> 01:49:01,360
你要接管我的屋子嗎? 你要拿走我的東西嗎?
You gonna take over my house? You gonna wear my pants?

2149
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:03,400
你要睡在我的床上嗎?
You gonna go in there and stretch out on my bed?

2150
01:49:05,170 --> 01:49:07,000
你認為你不用再對你父親客氣
You ain't got to say, "excuse me,"

2151
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,040
因為他在這裏毫無地位
because your daddy don't count around here no more.

2152
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:11,170
- 對嗎?   - 正是
- Is that right?   - That's right.

2153
01:49:11,170 --> 01:49:12,910
你老是說這種蠢事
You always talking this dumb stuff.

2154
01:49:12,910 --> 01:49:14,040
為何不放過我一下?
Now why don't you just get out my way?

2155
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:16,880
我猜你有自己的房子了
I guess you got some place to sleep.

2156
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:20,980
也能夠養活自己, 你能嗎?
Something to put in your belly. You got that?

2157
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:26,250
因為那就是你需要做到的, 你能嗎?
'Cause that's what you need. You got that?

2158
01:49:27,450 --> 01:49:29,990
你不知道我有什麼能耐! 你也沒有權利過問!
You don't know what I got! You ain't got to worry about what I got!

2159
01:49:30,190 --> 01:49:32,060
你說得對
You right.

2160
01:49:32,060 --> 01:49:33,860
完全正確
You 100% right.

2161
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:37,400
十七年來我一直都照顧你, 擔心你
I done spent the last 17 years worrying about what you got.

2162
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:39,270
所以現在輪到你作主了嗎?
Now, it's your turn, see?

2163
01:49:39,270 --> 01:49:41,400
我跟你說清楚現在的情況
I tell you what we do.

2164
01:49:42,940 --> 01:49:45,400
你長大了, 我們都知道吧
You grown. We done established that.

2165
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:48,640
你說你是成人, 現在就看看你到底是不是
You a man. Now, let's see you act like one.

2166
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:50,410
你現在轉身離開這裏
Turn your behind around and walk out this yard.

2167
01:49:50,410 --> 01:49:52,140
當你走出巷子時
And when you get out there in the alley,

2168
01:49:52,150 --> 01:49:53,650
你把這間屋子拋諸腦後
you can forget about this house, see.

2169
01:49:53,650 --> 01:49:55,110
因為這是我的房子
'Cause this is my house.

2170
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:57,950
你出去, 成為你所謂的大人, 然後找個地方住
You go on and be a man and get your own house.

2171
01:49:57,950 --> 01:50:00,220
你可以把這一切忘掉, 因為這都是我的
You can forget about this, 'cause this is mine.

2172
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:02,920
你出去過你的生活, 因為我已經不想再為你做什麼了
You go on and get yours, 'cause I'm through doing for you.

2173
01:50:03,090 --> 01:50:05,060
還扯為我做的事, 你給過我什麼?
What you done for me. What you ever give me?

2174
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:08,390
你的身體, 那個還在跳動的心臟, 臭小子
Them feet. Them bones. That pumping heart, nigger!

2175
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:11,330
我比任何人給過你的都多
Give you more than anybody else ever gonna give you.

2176
01:50:11,330 --> 01:50:13,670
你才沒有給過我什麼!
You ain't never gave me nothing!

2177
01:50:13,670 --> 01:50:15,300
你只會拖累我
You ain't never done nothing but hold me back,

2178
01:50:15,300 --> 01:50:17,970
害怕我會比你有成就!
afraid I was gonna be better than you!

2179
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:21,410
你做過的所有只是想讓我害怕你
All you ever did was try and make me scared of you.

2180
01:50:21,410 --> 01:50:23,440
以前你每一次叫我的時候, 我都在顫抖
I used to tremble every time you called my name.

2181
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:26,310
每一次我在屋裏聽到你的腳步聲也是
Every time I heard your footsteps in this house.

2182
01:50:26,310 --> 01:50:28,250
總是在想: 如果我這樣做, 爸怎樣反應?
Wondering all the time, "what's pop gonna say if I do this?

2183
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:29,520
他又會怎樣說?
"What's he gonna say if I do that?

2184
01:50:29,550 --> 01:50:31,650
如果我打開收音機他又會怎說?
"What's pop gonna say if I turn on the radio?"

2185
01:50:31,650 --> 01:50:34,170
媽媽也是! 她試著不去害怕你, 但終究也沒用
And mom, too! She tries, but she's scared of you.

2186
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:35,120
你媽媽與此無關, 她...
Leave your mama out of
this. Your mama ain't got...

2187
01:50:35,150 --> 01:50:37,260
真不懂為何你這樣對她後, 她還能接受你
I don't know how she stands you after what you did to her!

2188
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:38,690
我說過, 別把你媽媽混進這事
I told you, leave your mama outta this.

2189
01:50:38,690 --> 01:50:39,390
你要怎樣做? 打我嗎?
What are you gonna do? Give me a whupping?

2190
01:50:39,390 --> 01:50:41,430
你不能再打我了! 你太老了
You can't whup me no more! You're too old!

2191
01:50:41,430 --> 01:50:42,930
你只是個老頭而已
You're just an old man.

2192
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:44,160
臭小子!
Nigger!

2193
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:46,230
你就是這樣, 只是個...
That's what you are. You're just...

2194
01:50:48,270 --> 01:50:51,270
對我來說你只是個街上的流氓而已
You're just another nigger on the street to me.

2195
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:52,340
你瘋了! 你知道嗎?
You're crazy! You know that?

2196
01:50:52,340 --> 01:50:53,710
對, 去吧
Yeah, go on.

2197
01:50:53,710 --> 01:50:56,140
就這樣無視我, 你骨子裏頭是個惡人
Get on away from around me. You got the devil in you.

2198
01:50:56,140 --> 01:50:58,310
你只是個瘋老頭! 還說我是惡人
You are just a crazy old man! Talkin' about I got the "devil" in me!

2199
01:50:58,310 --> 01:50:59,410
對, 我瘋了
Yeah. I am crazy.

2200
01:50:59,410 --> 01:51:01,380
如果你不滾出我的院子
If you don't get the hell out of my yard,

2201
01:51:01,380 --> 01:51:03,450
我會讓你看看我有多瘋
I'm gonna show you how crazy I am.

2202
01:51:03,450 --> 01:51:05,180
快滾出我的院子!
Now, go on, get the hell out of my yard!

2203
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:06,260
這不是你的院子!
This ain't your yard!

2204
01:51:06,290 --> 01:51:08,150
你拿了Gabe叔叔打仗後的賠償
You took Uncle Gabe's money he got from the army

2205
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:09,690
去買這間房子, 然後趕走他了
to buy this house, when you put him out!

2206
01:51:09,690 --> 01:51:12,290
快滾出我的院子
Get your black ass out of my yard!

2207
01:51:12,290 --> 01:51:13,690
我哪都不去!
I ain't going nowhere!

2208
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:15,390
來啊, 趕走我啊, 我才不怕你
Come on, put me out, i ain't scared of you.

2209
01:51:17,300 --> 01:51:19,170
- 那是我的球棒   - 來啊
- That's my bat.   - Come on.

2210
01:51:19,170 --> 01:51:21,030
- 放下我的球棒   - 來啊, 趕走我!
- Put my bat down.   - Come on, put me out!

2211
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,200
怎麼了? 你要是那麼棒, 趕走我啊!
What's the matter? You so bad. Put me out!

2212
01:51:24,370 --> 01:51:26,340
你要有用它的打算
You're gonna have to use it.

2213
01:51:28,210 --> 01:51:31,110
你敢對著我拿起球棒, 就要有用它的打算
You want to draw that bat back on me, you're gonna have to use it.

2214
01:51:31,110 --> 01:51:32,180
來啊!
Come on!

2215
01:51:33,250 --> 01:51:34,710
來啊!
Come on!

2216
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:37,120
你要有打死我的打算
You're gonna have to kill me.

2217
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:40,290
要是你敢對著我拿起球棒
You want to draw that bat back on me,

2218
01:51:41,460 --> 01:51:43,260
你就要有打死我的打算
you're gonna have to kill me.

2219
01:51:44,730 --> 01:51:46,060
來啊
Come on.

2220
01:51:52,770 --> 01:51:56,140
你過來, 我教你
Come on. Then I'll show you.

2221
01:51:56,770 --> 01:51:58,100
來啊!
Come on!

2222
01:52:37,180 --> 01:52:39,310
走吧, 別再在我的房子出現
Go on, get away from around my house.

2223
01:52:49,090 --> 01:52:50,160
走啊
Go on.

2224
01:52:50,790 --> 01:52:52,790
跟媽媽說我會回來收拾細軟
Tell mama I'll be back for my things.

2225
01:52:52,790 --> 01:52:55,660
你的東西會被扔出這藩籬外!
They'll be on the other side of that fence!

2226
01:53:08,140 --> 01:53:09,640
感受不到
Can't taste nothing.

2227
01:53:20,290 --> 01:53:22,460
我什麼都感受不到
I can't taste nothing.

2228
01:53:25,390 --> 01:53:29,300
哈利路亞
Hallelujah!

2229
01:53:32,170 --> 01:53:33,570
哈利路亞
Hallelujah.

2230
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:45,510
哈利路亞
Hallelujah.

2231
01:53:48,180 --> 01:53:50,480
我什麼都感受不到了
I can't taste nothing no more.

2232
01:53:58,330 --> 01:53:59,590
來吧
Come on.

2233
01:54:00,530 --> 01:54:02,660
你和我作個了斷吧
It's between you and me now.

2234
01:54:04,200 --> 01:54:07,700
來吧, 隨時都行
Come on. Anytime you want.

2235
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:12,400
來吧, 我準備好了
Come on. I be ready for you.

2236
01:54:14,170 --> 01:54:16,710
但你別想能全身而退
But I ain't gonna be easy.

2237
01:54:29,220 --> 01:54:30,220
Raynell?
Raynell?

2238
01:54:30,220 --> 01:54:32,390
- 夫人?   - 你在做什麼?
- Ma'am?   - What you doing?

2239
01:54:32,460 --> 01:54:33,460
沒什麼
Nothing.

2240
01:54:33,490 --> 01:54:36,300
進來換衣服吧, 你在做什麼?
Get in here and get dressed. What are you doing?

2241
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:38,230
看看它們有沒有長大
See if my garden growed.

2242
01:54:38,230 --> 01:54:39,570
我說過它們不會一晚就長大
I told you it ain't gonna grow overnight.

2243
01:54:39,570 --> 01:54:40,730
你得耐心點
You got to wait.

2244
01:54:40,740 --> 01:54:43,700
對, 但那看起好像永遠不會長大, 該死的!
Yeah, but it look like it ain't never gonna grow, mama. Dag!

2245
01:54:44,370 --> 01:54:46,910
我說過, 心急水不沸
I told you, a watched pot never boils.

2246
01:54:46,910 --> 01:54:48,680
那可不同, 媽媽
This ain't even no pot, mama.

2247
01:54:48,710 --> 01:54:49,480
進來換衣服
Get in here and get dressed.

2248
01:54:49,510 --> 01:54:51,510
這不是出外玩的時候, 聽到了嗎?
This ain't no morning to be playing around, you hear me?

2249
01:54:52,210 --> 01:54:53,480
明白, 夫人
Yes, ma'am.

2250
01:54:56,180 --> 01:54:58,280
再見, 小田園
Bye, garden.

2251
01:55:19,510 --> 01:55:22,740
你好, 你想必就是Raynell吧
Hi. I bet your name is Raynell.

2252
01:55:25,410 --> 01:55:26,680
你媽媽在家嗎?
Is your mama home?

2253
01:55:28,420 --> 01:55:30,480
媽媽, 有個男人找你!
Mama, there's a man down here!

2254
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:32,380
媽媽
Mama!

2255
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:34,420
Cory?
Cory?

2256
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:37,790
Cory.
Cory.

2257
01:55:38,630 --> 01:55:40,490
Cory, Cory!
Cory. Cory!

2258
01:55:40,730 --> 01:55:44,660
- 噢, 我主慈悲!   - Cory
- Oh! Lord have mercy!   - Cory.

2259
01:55:48,770 --> 01:55:50,400
你們看看誰來了
Lookee here, y'all.

2260
01:55:52,240 --> 01:55:54,470
看他啊
Aww, looka here.

2261
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:57,310
都長大了
Done got all grown up.

2262
01:55:57,310 --> 01:55:58,740
別哭, 媽媽, 為何要哭呢?
Don't cry, mama. What you crying about?

2263
01:55:58,750 --> 01:56:01,480
只是因為你出現了
I'm just so glad you made it.

2264
01:56:01,480 --> 01:56:03,580
嗨, Lyons, 你最近怎了, Bono先生?
Hey, Lyons. How you doing, Mr. Bono?

2265
01:56:03,580 --> 01:56:05,650
看看你啊, 老兄
Look at you, man, look at you.

2266
01:56:05,650 --> 01:56:08,590
他看上去很威風凜凜吧, Rose? 都是下士了
Don't he look good, Rose? Got on them corporal stripes.

2267
01:56:08,590 --> 01:56:10,260
為何現在才來?
What took you so long?

2268
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:11,290
你知道軍隊怎操作的吧, 媽媽
You know how the marines are, mama.

2269
01:56:11,290 --> 01:56:12,590
他們得把所有文件檢查清楚
They got to get all their paperwork straight

2270
01:56:12,590 --> 01:56:13,990
才讓你做任何事
before they let you do anything.

2271
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,430
怎樣都好, 我很高興你趕來了, 他們讓Lyons來
Well, I'm sure glad you made it. They let Lyons come.

2272
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:18,600
你的叔叔Gabe還在醫院內
Your Uncle Gabe's still in the hospital.

2273
01:56:18,630 --> 01:56:20,700
他們不知道該否讓他出來
They don't know if they're gonna let him out or not.

2274
01:56:20,700 --> 01:56:22,400
我剛跟他們說過話
I talked to them a little while ago.

2275
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:24,740
美國海軍陸戰隊的下士
A corporal in the United States marines.

2276
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:27,010
你爸爸早知道你是軍人的材料
Your daddy knew you had it in you.

2277
01:56:27,010 --> 01:56:29,010
他以前總是這樣告訴我
He used to tell me all the time.

2278
01:56:29,010 --> 01:56:31,010
他看上去很不錯吧, Bono先生?
Hey, don't he look good, Mr. Bono?

2279
01:56:31,010 --> 01:56:34,680
對, 他讓我記起我第一次見到的Troy
Yeah, he reminds me of Troy when I first met him.

2280
01:56:35,620 --> 01:56:37,350
我說, Rose
Ah, say, Rose,

2281
01:56:37,350 --> 01:56:39,620
Lucille現在在教堂和唱詩班一起
Lucille's down at the church with the choir.

2282
01:56:39,620 --> 01:56:41,620
我先去跟那些護柩者說一下
I'm gonna go get the pallbearers lined up.

2283
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:42,820
晚點回來
I'll be back to get you all.

2284
01:56:43,060 --> 01:56:44,490
謝謝, Jim
Thanks, Jim.

2285
01:56:44,490 --> 01:56:45,560
晚點見, Bono先生
See you, Mr. Bono.

2286
01:56:49,530 --> 01:56:52,630
Cory, 看看Raynell
Cory, look at Raynell.

2287
01:56:52,630 --> 01:56:53,730
不是很美嗎?
Ain't she precious?

2288
01:56:53,730 --> 01:56:55,400
她將來定是個大美人
She's gonna break a whole lot of hearts.

2289
01:56:55,540 --> 01:56:57,070
跟你的哥哥打招呼, 這是你的哥哥Cory
Say hello to your brother. This your brother, Cory.

2290
01:56:57,070 --> 01:56:58,440
你記得Cory嗎?
You remember Cory?

2291
01:56:58,440 --> 01:56:59,510
不記得, 夫人
No, ma'am.

2292
01:56:59,510 --> 01:57:01,540
她怎可能記得我, 媽媽
Naw, she don't remember me, mama.

2293
01:57:01,540 --> 01:57:03,440
我們有時候會說起你, 她也在的
Oh, well, we talk about you. She heard us talk about you.

2294
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:06,510
這是你的哥哥Cory, 快打招呼
This is your brother, Cory. Say hello.

2295
01:57:06,510 --> 01:57:07,780
- 你好   - 你好
- Hi.   - Hi.

2296
01:57:07,780 --> 01:57:09,380
所以你就是Raynell吧
So, you're Raynell.

2297
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:12,720
媽媽說了很多關於你的事給我
Mama's told me a lot about you.

2298
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:15,050
讓我煮點早餐給你吃, 別餓壞
Come on, let me fix you some breakfast. Keep up your strength.

2299
01:57:15,130 --> 01:57:16,230
我不餓, 媽媽
I ain't hungry, mama.

2300
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:19,360
你可以煮點什麼給我, 我待會進去找你
You can fix me something, Rose. I'll be in there in a minute.

2301
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:20,660
你確定不吃點什麼嗎, Cory?
You sure you don't want nothing, Cory?

2302
01:57:20,660 --> 01:57:22,460
我知道他們沒什麼好吃的給你
I know they ain't feeding you right.

2303
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:23,760
不了, 媽媽, 謝謝, 我現在不想吃
No, mama, thanks. I don't feel like eating.

2304
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:24,860
晚點吧
I'll get something later.

2305
01:57:24,870 --> 01:57:28,830
Raynell, get up there and get
that dress on like I told you.

2306
01:57:40,110 --> 01:57:43,450
我早就知道你能成就大事
I always knew you was gonna make something out of yourself.

2307
01:57:44,850 --> 01:57:47,620
你永遠朝著正確的方向走
Your head was always in the right direction.

2308
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:51,660
所以
So,

2309
01:57:53,390 --> 01:57:54,890
你打算繼續服役嗎?
you gonna stay in?

2310
01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:57,500
讓它成為你的事業? 為軍隊付出20年?
Make it a career? Put in your 20 years?

2311
01:57:57,700 --> 01:58:01,500
我不知道, 已經服役六年了, 我想已經足夠了
I don't know. I got six already. I think that's enough.

2312
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:05,100
為美國效力然後早早退休
Stick with Uncle Sam and retire early.

2313
01:58:05,110 --> 01:58:06,910
這裏沒有什麼
Ain't nothing out here.

2314
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:11,510
我想Rose跟你說過我發生什麼事了吧
I guess Rose told you about what happened with me.

2315
01:58:13,780 --> 01:58:16,650
他們現在讓我在囚犯工廠工作
They got me down at the workhouse.

2316
01:58:16,650 --> 01:58:19,520
我自以為偷偷的兌現他人支票很聰明
I thought I was being slick cashing other people's checks.

2317
01:58:20,690 --> 01:58:22,590
被判多少年了?
How much time you doing?

2318
01:58:23,420 --> 01:58:25,790
三年
They give me three years.

2319
01:58:25,790 --> 01:58:28,960
我接受了, 現在只剩九個月
I got that beat now. I ain't got but nine more months.

2320
01:58:34,470 --> 01:58:36,800
那也不是件壞事
It ain't so bad.

2321
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:39,840
你能學會如何面對它, 像面對其他事一樣
You learn to deal with it like anything else.

2322
01:58:42,140 --> 01:58:44,140
人生不如意事十常八九
"You got to take the crookeds with the straights,"

2323
01:58:44,150 --> 01:58:47,550
那就是爸爸的座右銘
that's what papa used to say.

2324
01:58:47,550 --> 01:58:51,150
他以前被三振後老是這樣說
He used to say that when he struck out.

2325
01:58:51,150 --> 01:58:53,520
我看見過他被連續三次三振
I seen him strike out three times in a row,

2326
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:57,720
再上場時, 他把球打到看台上
and the next time up, he hit the ball over the grandstand.

2327
01:58:57,730 --> 01:59:00,760
在霍姆斯特德的棒球場上 [佛羅里達州]
Right out there in Homestead field.

2328
01:59:01,460 --> 01:59:03,430
他打到看台上還不滿意
He wasn't satisfied hitting in the seats.

2329
01:59:03,430 --> 01:59:05,430
他想打出球場外
He wanted to hit it over everything.

2330
01:59:06,670 --> 01:59:08,530
比賽完結後
Then after the game,

2331
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:14,570
有200位觀眾等著與他握手
he had 200 people standing around, waiting to shake his hand.

2332
01:59:17,780 --> 01:59:20,580
人生不如意事十常八九
You got to take the crookeds with the straights.

2333
01:59:23,950 --> 01:59:25,850
他真與眾不同
Papa was something else.

2334
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:29,220
你還在玩音樂嗎?
You still playing?

2335
01:59:29,220 --> 01:59:30,920
Cory, 你知道我不會放棄音樂的
Cory, you know I'm gonna do that.

2336
01:59:31,790 --> 01:59:34,190
我跟那裏幾個志同道合的人, 組成了樂隊
We got some fellas down there. We got us a band.

2337
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:37,230
出獄後我們打算繼續一起表演, 但...
We gonna try to stay together when we get out, but...

2338
01:59:37,230 --> 01:59:38,560
對
Yeah.

2339
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:41,930
我還在玩音樂
I'm still playing.

2340
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:44,000
它仍然是我有動力活下去的原因
Still helps me get out of bed in the morning.

2341
01:59:44,070 --> 01:59:45,170
只要它一天是
As long as it do that,

2342
01:59:45,200 --> 01:59:48,870
我就不會放棄它, 更認真對待它
I'm gonna stick with it, try to make some sense out of it.

2343
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:51,610
Lyons, 我煮了蛋給你
Lyons, I got these eggs in a pan.

2344
01:59:53,710 --> 01:59:55,880
讓我進去吃點什麼, 老兄
Let me get in here and get these eggs, man.

2345
01:59:55,880 --> 01:59:57,950
然後準備讓爸爸入土
Get ready to go bury papa.

2346
02:00:03,890 --> 02:00:05,520
你過得怎樣了?
How you doing?

2347
02:00:06,890 --> 02:00:08,590
你還好嗎?
You doing all right?

2348
02:00:26,250 --> 02:00:28,980
你好
Hi.

2349
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:31,650
你以前睡在我的房間嗎?
You used to sleep in my room?

2350
02:00:32,790 --> 02:00:34,850
對, 那以前是我的房間
Yeah, that used to be my room.

2351
02:00:35,290 --> 02:00:38,520
那就是爸爸說的, Cory的房間
That's what papa callit. "Cory's room."

2352
02:00:40,660 --> 02:00:42,730
你的美式足球還在櫃裏
Got your football in the closet.

2353
02:00:42,730 --> 02:00:45,830
Raynell, 快換衣服, 也穿上新的鞋子
Raynell. Get up there, get dressed, and put them good shoes on.

2354
02:00:45,830 --> 02:00:48,030
媽媽, 我就不能穿這雙嗎? 那雙新鞋子弄痛我的腳
Mama, can I just wear these? Them others hurt my feet!

2355
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:50,300
那也只會弄痛一會兒而已
Well, they're just gonna have to hurt your feet for a while.

2356
02:00:50,300 --> 02:00:51,270
你買的時候
You ain't said they hurt your feet

2357
02:00:51,270 --> 02:00:52,740
也沒說它們會弄痛你
when you went down to the store and got 'em.

2358
02:00:52,740 --> 02:00:54,870
那時候不痛, 現在我的雙腳都長大了
They didn't hurt then. My feet done got bigger.

2359
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:56,680
別給我頂嘴!
Don't give me no back talk!

2360
02:00:56,680 --> 02:00:59,650
快換衣服, 穿上新鞋子
Get up there, get dressed, and put them good shoes on.

2361
02:02:07,010 --> 02:02:09,950
這裏沒什麼大改變
Ain't too much changed.

2362
02:02:09,950 --> 02:02:12,820
那棒球還吊在樹上
He still got that rag tied to the tree.

2363
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:17,990
他當時在這裏揮棒
He was out here swinging that bat.

2364
02:02:19,660 --> 02:02:22,630
我剛想回去屋子內
I was just getting ready to go back in the house.

2365
02:02:23,700 --> 02:02:26,630
他一揮, 然後整個人就倒下了
He swung that bat and just fell over.

2366
02:02:28,870 --> 02:02:32,840
當他揮棒時, 他看起來好像在笑
Seem like, when he swung it, he stood there with this grin on his face.

2367
02:02:38,710 --> 02:02:40,210
下一秒就倒下了
Then he just fell over.

2368
02:02:43,050 --> 02:02:44,850
他們來把他送到醫院
They carried him down there to the hospital,

2369
02:02:44,850 --> 02:02:46,950
但我知道已經沒有需要了
but I knew there wasn't no need.

2370
02:02:49,420 --> 02:02:50,420
不如跟我進去再說?
Why don't you come on in the house?

2371
02:02:50,420 --> 02:02:53,060
媽媽, 我有點事要告訴你
Mama, I got something to tell you.

2372
02:02:54,390 --> 02:02:57,730
我不知道該怎開口, 但我得告訴你
I don't know how to tell you this, but I got to tell you.

2373
02:02:57,730 --> 02:02:59,800
我不會出席爸爸的葬禮
I'm not going to papa's funeral.

2374
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,900
小子, 閉嘴
Boy, hush your mouth.

2375
02:03:05,910 --> 02:03:08,070
那是你的爸爸!
That's your daddy you talking about!

2376
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:10,140
我不想在這種時候聽到你說這個
I don't want to hear that kind of talk this morning.

2377
02:03:10,140 --> 02:03:11,780
我這麼辛苦把你養成這樣的嗎?
I done raised you to come to this?

2378
02:03:11,780 --> 02:03:13,510
你健健康康的
You standing there all healthy and grown,

2379
02:03:13,510 --> 02:03:14,980
怎麼說你不出席爸爸的葬禮了?
talking about you ain't going to your daddy's funeral?

2380
02:03:14,980 --> 02:03:17,150
- 媽媽, 聽著   - 我不想聽, Cory!
- Mama, listen... - I don't want to hear it, Cory!

2381
02:03:17,220 --> 02:03:18,420
別再改樣想了
Just get that thought out of your head.

2382
02:03:18,450 --> 02:03:21,220
我得向他說不, 就一次, 我得說不
I've got to say no to him. One time in my life, I got to say no.

2383
02:03:21,220 --> 02:03:22,990
我不想聽這些!
I don't got to listen to that!

2384
02:03:22,990 --> 02:03:24,760
我知道你和你爸爸不和
Now, I know you and your daddy ain't seen eye to eye,

2385
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:28,090
但我不想在這種時候聽到你說出這種話
but I don't have to listen to that kind of talk this morning.

2386
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:30,900
不尊重父親不是作為一個男人該做的事, Cory
Disrespecting your daddy ain't gonna make you a man, Cory.

2387
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:32,760
你得找個方法讓自己接受
You gotta find some way to come to that on your own.

2388
02:03:32,770 --> 02:03:35,130
不出席你爸爸的葬禮不會讓你成人的
Not going to your daddy's funeral ain't gonna make you a man.

2389
02:03:38,100 --> 02:03:41,110
我以前在這裏的日子
The whole time I was growing up, living in his house,

2390
02:03:41,110 --> 02:03:44,110
爸爸就像一道永遠跟著你的黑影
papa was like a shadow that followed you everywhere.

2391
02:03:44,910 --> 02:03:48,110
它就像個重擔, 它會侵蝕到你體內
It weighed on you, and it sunk into your flesh.

2392
02:03:48,850 --> 02:03:50,880
它會把你緊緊的包著, 不讓你走
It would wrap around you and lay there

2393
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:53,220
直到你分不清哪個才是真正的自己
until you couldn't tell which one was you anymore.

2394
02:03:53,220 --> 02:03:57,760
那黑影就一點點的侵蝕到你皮下
That shadow just diggin' into your flesh!

2395
02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:00,030
試著佔據你的心, 然後控制你
Trying to crawl in. Trying to live through you.

2396
02:04:00,930 --> 02:04:05,760
哪裏都是Troy Maxson的蹤影
Everywhere I looked, I saw Troy Maxson staring right back at me.

2397
02:04:05,770 --> 02:04:08,930
在你床下, 又或是在衣櫃內
Hiding under the bed, in the closet.

2398
02:04:08,940 --> 02:04:10,470
我只是想說我得找個方法
I'm just saying I got to find a way

2399
02:04:10,470 --> 02:04:11,970
去擺脫那個黑影, 媽媽
to get rid of that shadow, mama.

2400
02:04:11,970 --> 02:04:14,210
你就像他, 他早已佔據你的心了
You just like him. You got him in you good.

2401
02:04:14,210 --> 02:04:15,510
別說我是他, 媽媽
Don't tell me that, mama.

2402
02:04:15,510 --> 02:04:16,810
你簡直就是Troy Maxson
You Troy Maxson all over again.

2403
02:04:16,810 --> 02:04:19,210
我不想成為Troy Maxson!
I don't want to be Troy Maxson!

2404
02:04:20,510 --> 02:04:22,150
我只想做我自己
I just want to be me.

2405
02:04:22,150 --> 02:04:25,150
你永遠都會是你自己啊, Cory
You can't be nobody but who you are, Cory.

2406
02:04:25,150 --> 02:04:28,490
那黑影只不過是你自己製造出來的
That shadow wasn't nothing but you growing into yourself.

2407
02:04:28,490 --> 02:04:30,490
你要麼早晚成為它, 要麼就只接受它的部份
You either got to grow into it, or cut it down to fit you,

2408
02:04:30,490 --> 02:04:32,960
但你要生活就得這樣做
but that's all you got to make a life with.

2409
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:37,030
那就是唯一你要跟外面的人比較的東西
That's all you got to measure yourself against the world out there.

2410
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:40,970
你爸爸想你成為和他完全不一樣的人
Your daddy wanted you to be everything he wasn't,

2411
02:04:40,970 --> 02:04:42,500
同時間
and at the same time,

2412
02:04:42,500 --> 02:04:45,240
他也想你成為他啊
he wanted you to be everything he was.

2413
02:04:45,540 --> 02:04:47,240
我不評論他是對還是錯
Now, I don't know if he was right or wrong,

2414
02:04:47,240 --> 02:04:48,540
但我知道
but I do know

2415
02:04:48,540 --> 02:04:51,810
他本意是想做好事而非傷害你
he meant to do more good than he meant to do harm.

2416
02:04:53,550 --> 02:04:56,350
有時候他想碰觸他人, 自己也會受傷
Sometimes, when he touched, he bruised,

2417
02:04:57,120 --> 02:05:00,390
有時候他想做好事, 卻成了壞事
and sometimes, when he took me in his arms, he cut.

2418
02:05:07,190 --> 02:05:09,360
我最初遇見你爸爸時
When I first met your daddy,

2419
02:05:10,260 --> 02:05:12,030
我在想
I thought,

2420
02:05:12,030 --> 02:05:15,170
那是個我可以付託終身的人
"here is a man I can lay down with and make a baby."

2421
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:21,840
那就是我對他的第一個想法
That's the first thing I thought when I seen him.

2422
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:24,110
我當時想: Rose Lee
I thought, "Rose Lee,

2423
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:26,980
那是個你可以真誠相對的人
"here's a man you can open yourself up to

2424
02:05:26,980 --> 02:05:29,150
然後被他的愛填得滿滿的
"and be filled to bursting!

2425
02:05:30,580 --> 02:05:35,320
那是個可以把你心裏空白的位置
"Here's a man that can fill up all them empty spaces

2426
02:05:35,320 --> 02:05:38,160
全都補上的人
"you been tipping around the edges of."

2427
02:05:43,300 --> 02:05:46,330
當你爸爸進門時
When your daddy walked through the house,

2428
02:05:46,330 --> 02:05:48,200
他是...
he was just

2429
02:05:49,240 --> 02:05:51,870
那麼的大啊 [形容他獨力承擔起家庭]
so big.

2430
02:05:53,310 --> 02:05:55,140
他心裏全都佔滿了 [工作]
He filled it up!

2431
02:05:57,580 --> 02:06:00,350
那是我犯下的第一個錯誤
That was my first mistake.

2432
02:06:00,350 --> 02:06:02,980
沒讓他在心裏留點位置給我
Not to make him leave some room for me.

2433
02:06:03,250 --> 02:06:05,180
但
But

2434
02:06:07,320 --> 02:06:10,060
我想要個快樂的家
I wanted a house I could sing in.

2435
02:06:11,260 --> 02:06:14,630
你爸爸也給我了
And that's what your daddy gave me.

2436
02:06:14,630 --> 02:06:16,260
我不知道該怎樣跟上他的步伐
I didn't know to keep up his strength,

2437
02:06:16,260 --> 02:06:18,960
我得犧牲自己
I had to give up little pieces of mine.

2438
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:24,070
我把他的生活當做是我的生活
I took on his life as mine and mixed up the pieces,

2439
02:06:24,070 --> 02:06:27,140
以致難以分辨到底那是我的, 還是他的生活 [成全他]
so you couldn't hardly tell which was which.

2440
02:06:29,940 --> 02:06:33,110
那是我的選擇, 放棄我的人生
It was my choice. My life.

2441
02:06:33,110 --> 02:06:36,180
而我根本不用那樣屈就自己啊
And I didn't have to live it like that,

2442
02:06:38,180 --> 02:06:40,250
但那是我作為女人得做的
but that's what life offered me in the way of being a woman,

2443
02:06:40,250 --> 02:06:41,450
而我也接受了
and I took it.

2444
02:06:43,660 --> 02:06:46,630
我全然接受了
I grabbed it with both hands.

2445
02:06:46,630 --> 02:06:49,930
當Raynell來到我們家裏時
And by the time Raynell came into the house...

2446
02:06:54,670 --> 02:06:59,170
我不想從別人的不幸上得到快樂
I didn't want to make my blessings off of nobody's misfortune,

2447
02:07:00,970 --> 02:07:04,110
但我依然把Raynell當作
but I took on to Raynell like she was

2448
02:07:04,110 --> 02:07:07,280
我想要但卻從沒有過的孩子
all them babies I wanted and never had.

2449
02:07:09,380 --> 02:07:12,450
就像我可以取回我原本的人生, 即使那麼一點也好
Like I'd been blessed to relive a part of my life.

2450
02:07:15,190 --> 02:07:18,960
如果上帝認為有需要的話
And if the lord see fit to keep up my strength,

2451
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:25,030
我會像你爸爸對你那樣對待她
I'm gonna do her exactly how your daddy did you.

2452
02:07:28,330 --> 02:07:31,240
我會把我最好的都給她
I'm gonna give her the best of what's in me.

2453
02:07:41,180 --> 02:07:42,280
媽媽!
Mama!

2454
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:44,420
Tolliver牧師打來了
Reverend Tolliver on the phone.

2455
02:08:02,200 --> 02:08:03,270
你好
Hi.

2456
02:08:05,710 --> 02:08:06,970
你好
Hi.

2457
02:08:07,270 --> 02:08:09,440
你在軍隊還是陸戰隊?
You in the army or the marines?

2458
02:08:09,440 --> 02:08:11,110
陸戰隊
Marines.

2459
02:08:12,180 --> 02:08:15,380
爸爸說你在軍隊, 你認識Blue嗎?
Papa said it was army. You know Blue?

2460
02:08:15,750 --> 02:08:17,250
Blue? 誰是Blue?
Blue? Who's blue?

2461
02:08:17,380 --> 02:08:19,520
爸爸以前養的狗, 說起他時總會唱起歌來
Papa's dog, what he sing about all the time.

2462
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:24,520
Here, Ring. Yeah, Ring Here

2463
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:29,120
I had an old dog whose name was Blue

2464
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:31,820
You know that Blue was mighty true

2465
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:34,820
You know Blue was a good old dog

2466
02:08:37,300 --> 02:08:38,520
Blue treed a 'possum in a hollow log

2467
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:41,520
From that you know Blue's a good old dog

2468
02:08:41,700 --> 02:08:43,520
Here, Ring. Yeah, Ring Here

2469
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:46,520
Blue treed a 'possum out on a limb

2470
02:08:47,500 --> 02:08:49,120
Blue looked at me and I looked at him

2471
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:52,120
Grabbed that 'possum and put him in a sack

2472
02:08:53,200 --> 02:08:54,520
Do fer me, Blue, 'til I get back

2473
02:08:54,900 --> 02:08:57,120
Old Blue's feet was big and round

2474
02:08:57,500 --> 02:08:59,120
Never 'lowed a 'possum to tech the ground

2475
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:01,820
Old Blue died and I dug his grave

2476
02:09:02,900 --> 02:09:04,820
I dug his grave with a silver spade

2477
02:09:05,700 --> 02:09:07,020
I let him down with a golden chain

2478
02:09:07,500 --> 02:09:09,420
And every link I called his name

2479
02:09:10,500 --> 02:09:11,820
Go on Blue you good dog you

2480
02:09:12,070 --> 02:09:13,100
一起唱
Come on.

2481
02:09:13,770 --> 02:09:15,100
Go on Blue you good dog you

2482
02:09:15,770 --> 02:09:17,400
Blue laid down and died like a man

2483
02:09:18,770 --> 02:09:20,300
Blue laid down and died...

2484
02:09:21,870 --> 02:09:24,800
Blue laid down and died like a man

2485
02:09:26,770 --> 02:09:28,400
Now he's treein' 'possums in the promised land

2486
02:09:30,370 --> 02:09:32,300
I'm goin' to tell you this jes' to let you know

2487
02:09:33,370 --> 02:09:35,300
Old Blue's gone where the good dogs go

2488
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:46,370
Cory, 我們得準備起行了
Cory, we're getting ready to leave now!

2489
02:09:53,380 --> 02:09:56,380
聽媽媽的話, 上去換好鞋子
Go upstairs and put your shoes on like mama told you,

2490
02:09:56,380 --> 02:09:59,350
然後去爸爸的葬禮
so we can get ready to go to papa's funeral.

2491
02:10:00,290 --> 02:10:02,450
好的, 一會見
Okay. I'll be back.

2492
02:10:12,870 --> 02:10:14,130
Rose!
Rose!

2493
02:10:16,500 --> 02:10:18,140
嘿, Rose!
Hey, Rose!

2494
02:10:18,300 --> 02:10:20,440

2495
02:10:20,440 --> 02:10:22,440
嘿, Rose, 我來了!
Hey, Rose, I'm here!

2496
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:24,240
- Lyons, 看看是誰!   - 看, Rose?
- Lyons, lookit here!    - See, Rose?

2497
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:26,180
我就知道, 我說過他們會讓他來
I told you. I told you they'd let him come.

2498
02:10:26,180 --> 02:10:28,250
- 你好嗎, Gabe叔叔?   - 你好嗎, Gabe叔叔?
- How you doing, Uncle Gabe? - How you doing, Uncle Gabe?

2499
02:10:28,250 --> 02:10:30,420
嘿, Rose, 是時候了!
Hey! Hey, Rose, it's time!

2500
02:10:30,420 --> 02:10:33,690
是時候叫聖彼得打開天堂之門了
It's time to tell Saint Peter to open the gates.

2501
02:10:37,190 --> 02:10:40,530
你準備好了嗎, Troy?
You ready, Troy? Troy, you ready?

2502
02:10:40,530 --> 02:10:43,530
我要叫聖彼得打開門了
I'm gonna tell Saint Peter to open the gates.

2503
02:10:43,530 --> 02:10:46,130
你快準備好
You get ready now.

2504
02:11:16,360 --> 02:11:17,560
Troy!
Troy!

2505
02:11:18,230 --> 02:11:19,560
Troy.
Troy.

2506
02:12:15,650 --> 02:12:18,490
這就對了
That's the way that go.
