需要全程參與
involved every step of the way,

420

他們也應該受到重視
and they need to be taken seriously.

421
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,030
然後

424
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:04,980
薩羅

I want to run hotels, so I put all the profits into my pocket.

426
00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:12,570
先說說你來自哪裡吧  好嗎
Well, let's start with where you are from? Shall we?

427
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:13,910
你出生在澳大利亞嗎

00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:19,960
我有家人在加爾各答  我的表親們特別糟糕
I've got family in Calcutta. My cousins are quite bad.

431
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:20,990
哪個地區
Which part?

432
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:24,720
我是被領養的  我不算是印度人
I'm adopted. I'm not really Indian.

433
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,400
但是你喜歡板球  對吧
But you like cricket though, right?

434
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:32,690
你喜歡板球啊
Ah, you like cricket...

435
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:35,540
你支持澳洲隊還是印度隊
You go for the Aussies or the Indians?

436
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:36,580
只支持澳洲隊
Only the Aussies, mate!

437
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:40,010
只支持澳洲隊
Only the Aussies, mate!

438
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,890
這就有意思了
This is going to be interesting.

439
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:43,450
好了  薩羅
Okay, Saroo...

440
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,680
你為什麼選這門課
Why did you choose this course?

441
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:47,710
你還希望從中獲得什麼
What else do you want to get out of it?

442
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,630
-你好  -你好
- Hi. - Hey!

443
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:36,300

00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:44,280
嗨  你好嗎
Hi, how are you?

447
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:46,770
你們喜歡吃印度菜嗎
Do you guys like Indian food?

448
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,760
只準備了印度菜  只有這些
That's all we have. That's all we have.

449
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:54,020
-聞起來好香啊  -我試著學別人...
- It smells so great. - I tried to copy someone...

450
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:58,250
你有沒有跳過寶萊塢舞蹈
You've ever done Bollywood dance?

451
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:00,370
-只動一條腿這樣  -對  一條腿
- Oh, just like, one leg. - Yeah, one leg...

452
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,300

- Lampo de poche. - Flashlight is er...

455
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:14,710
你們怎麼叫
What do you say?

456
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:15,780
電筒
Torch.

457
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,230
如果你想用手抓著吃
If you want to eat with your hands,

458
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:20,220
就要用饢盛著  像勺子一樣
you need to use the naan, like a spoon.

459
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,150
-用叉子吧  -不  讓他用饢
- Use a fork. - No, let him use the naan.

460
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:24,150
你們怎麼說的士

461
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:25,890
-的士  -的士
- Taxi. - Taxi.

462
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,040
這個詞在所有語言裡都一樣
It is the same in every language.

463
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,380
你想用叉子嗎  薩羅
Do you want a fork, Saroo?

464
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,400
好啊
Yeah!

465
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,370
他像我父親一樣

466
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,020
-你要不要再來一瓶啤酒  -要  謝謝
- You want another beer? - Yes please, thank you.

467
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:03,650
古度  我想吃糖耳朵
Guddu, I want some jalebi.

468
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,160
你好啊
Hello...

469
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,150
你沒事吧
You okay?

470
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:42,860
薩羅
Saroo?

471
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,040
我並不是來自加爾各答
I'm not from Calcutta.

472
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:55,290
我迷路了
I'm lost.

473
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:59,430
豪拉火車站很大  你當時一定嚇壞了
Howrah station is enormous, you must have been freaking out.

474
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:02,030
有一次我去布裡朝聖  經過那裡
I once went through there on a pilgrimage to Puri,

475
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:03,980
結果我兩次沒趕上火車
and I missed my connection twice.

476
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:06,110
你那時候不會說孟加拉語嗎
And you didn't speak Bengali?

477
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:08,560
我當時連那種語言叫什麼都不知道
I didn't even know it was called that.

478
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:12,060
-你在火車上待了多長時間  -好幾天吧
- How long were you on the train? - A couple of days.

479
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,510
好幾天嗎
A couple of days?

480
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:16,520
薩羅  你的家鄉在哪裡來著
Saroo, what was your hometown again?

481
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,560
甘尼斯塔萊
Ganestlay.

482
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,850
我一定是記錯了  因為沒有這個地方
I must have had it wrong because it doesn't exist.

483
01:02:22,850 --> 01:02:25,160
但你一定還記得別的線索吧
But there must be something else that you do remember.

484
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:30,200
那個月臺
The platform...

485
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,940
我睡著的地方  有一個很大的雨水收集箱
I fell asleep on, there's a big rain tank.

486
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:36,530
那裡離甘尼斯塔萊只有幾站路
It was only a few stops from Ganestlay.

487
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:40,230
成千上萬的火車站都有雨水收集箱
There are thousands of stations with rain tanks.

488
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:41,860
好吧  這是很久以前的事了
Okay, it was a long time ago.

489
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:43,960
你有沒有聽說過一個新項目  叫穀歌地球
Have you heard of this new program, Google Earth?

490
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:47,130
它很神奇  可以幫你找到世界上任何一個地方
It's incredible, you can find any place from anywhere.

491
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:48,650
聽我說  我們可以查出
Listen to me, we can find

492
01:02:48,650 --> 01:02:51,380
當時客運列車的時速是多少
out how fast passenger trains went back then.

493
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:52,860
我們用那個時速
We take that speed,

494
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,320
乘以你坐火車的小時數
multiply by the hours that you were on the train.

495
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:56,440
就成了
That's it!

496
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,320
我們能得出搜索半徑
We create a search radius.

497
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:01,090
然後在這範圍內  找出那個有雨水收集箱的車站
And inside there, you will find the station with the rain tank.

498
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,300
沒錯  可是搜索印度
Yeah, but it will take a

499
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:04,520
所有的火車站  要花上一輩子的時間
lifetime to search all the stations in India.

500
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:06,730
我有說所有的火車站嗎
Did I say all the stations?

501
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:07,920
好吧  哪怕只找一半
Ok, even half the stations.

502
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:09,960
各位  我真的不想談論這件事
Really guys, I don't want to talk about this.

503
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:13,930
你的父母有找過你嗎
Did your parents try to find you?

504
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:15,960
-怎麼了  -他們當然找過他
- What? - They tried to find him.

505
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,220
不  我的意思是
No I just mean like,

506
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:20,260
如果他們找過你  可能會留下書面線索
if they tried to find him, maybe they left like a paper trail.

507
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:21,500
什麼書面線索
What paper trail?

508
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,990
-他連自己姓什麼都不知道  -我媽不識字
- He didn't know his surname. - My mum couldn't read or write.

509
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:26,460
她做什麼工作的
What does she do?

510
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,690
勞工  她抬石塊的
A labourer, she carried rocks.

511
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:29,740
你媽媽嗎
Your mum?

512
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:39,330
我媽大約四年前去世了
My mom died about four years ago now.

513
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:41,100
我很遺憾
I'm sorry.

514
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:44,370
我爸爸還是很生她的氣
My dad is still so angry at her.

515
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,070
當然不是因為她病了
Not for getting sick, obviously...

516
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:48,950
而是因為她不肯做化療
but just for refusing chemo.

517
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:54,710
但她很瞭解自己  清楚自己想要的生活方式
But she just knew herself, you know? She knew what her terms were

518
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:57,050
以及如何度過餘下的時間  所以...
and she knew how she wanted to live, so...

519
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:01,170
大概就是無法接受吧
Just couldn't accept that, I guess.

520
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,410
那你又是什麼感覺
And how do you feel?

521
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:09,240
我很想她
I just miss her.

522
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,310
你覺得巴拉特關於搜索半徑那個提議怎麼樣
And what do you think of Bharat's search radius idea?

523
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,480
那是什麼意思
What was that?

524
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:31,280
這是你的舞步嗎  你是這樣跳舞的嗎
Is that your dance? Is that how you dance?

525
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:32,850
天啊
Oh, God!

526
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:07,430
{\an8}客運列車速度

527

528
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:39,320
你不能再這樣下去了
You can't keep going on like this.

529
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:43,350
讓我來幫你
Let me help you.

530
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,670
我們去跑步吧
Let's go for a run.

531
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:53,820
什麼
What?

532
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:01,100

533
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:10,030
過來
Come here.

534
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:12,760
等一下
Hold on.

535
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,000
抽筋了
Got a cramp.

536
01:08:16,530 --> 01:08:18,870
你騙我  你作弊
You lied! You cheat.

537
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:25,670
我從來沒給別人看過這個
I never show anybody this.

538
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,670
為什麼  很美啊
Why? They're beautiful.

539
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:32,080
我真的很喜歡畫畫  這是我的小愛好
I do enjoy it. My little hobby.

540
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:35,740
看看曼塔希啊
Oh wow, look at Mantosh!

541
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,160
他今晚會來  我真的很高興
I'm so glad he's coming tonight.

542
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:40,890
狂妄無禮的小東西
Cheeky little thing.

543
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:42,190
精力十足
Pure energy.

544
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:45,390
但是很了不起
But incredible.

545
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:47,700
真有愛
So sweet!

546
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:50,630
他一向難以控制  可是
He's been hard to control, but...

547
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:54,560
卻非常聰明
very, very smart... and very...

548
01:09:55,130 --> 01:09:59,000
只要他能學會控制自己  他做什麼都能成功
I mean, he could do anything if he just learned to control that energy.

549
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:00,540
他任何事情都能做到
He could do it, and do it all.

550
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,640
薩羅對他的保護欲很強
Saroo is very protective of him.

551
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:09,550
我很幸運
I've been blessed.

552
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:15,420
非常幸運
Very blessed.

553
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:20,190
你媽媽給我看了你以前那些獎盃
Your mom showed me all your old little trophies.

554
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,320
媽媽  你不是吧
Mum, you didn't.

555
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:26,260
我都不知道你以前那麼喜歡運動
I didn't know you were so athletic.

556
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,970
那些只是一半而已  還有很多在車庫裡
That's only half of them. There's plenty more in the garage.

557
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:31,030
你去哪兒  夥計
Hey, where you going, mate?

558
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:33,070
把煙抽完
Finishing my smoke.

559
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:34,980
現在我想讓他離開沙發
I can barely get him off...

560
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,940
-都很難  -露西
- ...the couch these days. - Lucy!

561
01:10:42,610 --> 01:10:43,720
你為什麼就不能告訴他們
Why can't you just tell them...

562
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,170
-你最近在幹什麼  -不要說
- what you've been up to? - Don't!

563
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:48,220
告訴我們
Tell us.

564
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:50,850
他們會理解和支持你
They will understand and they will support you.

565
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:53,190
什麼事  快說吧
What? Come on.

566
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:55,160
嘿  吃晚餐了
Hey, um, dinner!

567
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:57,790
趕快趁熱吃吧
Better eat it, while it's hot.

568
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,960
-你餓了嗎  -是的
- You hungry? - Yeah.

569
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:05,770
怎麼了
What?

570
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:09,160
我錯過了什麼
What have I missed?

571
01:11:09,370 --> 01:11:10,370
沒什麼
Nothing.

572
01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:13,110
-她看起來不高興  -她沒有不高興
- She looks upset. - She's not upset!

573
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:14,410
你又不知道我的感受
You don't know how I feel.

574
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,490
薩羅無所不知
Saroo knows everything.

575
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:21,380
他可是專家
He's an expert.

576
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:23,620
他是個經理
He's a manager.

577
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:26,580
你為什麼來這裡
Why are you here?

578
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,040
因為他是你的兄弟
He's here because he's your brother.

579
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:31,380
不  他不是
No, he's not.

580
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,270
-我們不一樣  -住口  薩羅
- We're different. - Hey, now now, Saroo!

581
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:42,440
薩羅
Saroo...

582
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:50,810
好了
All right.

583
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:56,620
沒事的
It's all right.

584
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:00,390
別這樣
Hey hey, no no...

585
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:06,830
沒事了  沒事了  停下
It's all right, It's all right... Stop!

586
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:09,380
不要動
Don't move.

587
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,140
沒事了
It's okay.

588
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:14,300
幹得好啊
Nice one, mate.

589
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:21,430
沒事了  沒事了  深呼吸  深呼吸
It's okay mate, It's okay, just breathe, mate. Just breathe...

590
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:31,420
我恨他對你造成的傷害
I hate what he's done to you.

591
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:06,620
對不起
I'm sorry.

592
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:25,940
薩羅
Saroo!

593
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:28,780
薩羅
Saroo.

594
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:32,080
薩羅
Saroo!

595
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:42,790
吻我
Kiss me.

596
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,380
別這樣  求你了
Stop, please.

597
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:51,270
看著我
Look at me.

598
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:55,380
看著我
Look at me!

599
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:57,300
-晚點再談  行嗎  -你魂不守舍的
- Can this wait? - Where are you?

600
01:14:57,470 --> 01:14:59,500
能不能等我們回家再談
Can this wait 'til we get home?

601
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:01,450
-行嗎  -家
- Yah? - Home?

602
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:04,840
什麼家
What home?

603
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:06,680
你是指我獨自待在一個房間
You mean, where I'm alone

604
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:08,680
你獨自待在另一個房間的那個地方嗎
in one room and you're alone in another room?

605
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:09,880
來啊
Come on.

606
01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:12,310
別這樣  露西
Stop, Luce. Stop it.

607
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:14,650
來啊
Come on.

608
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:16,220
求你了
Please.

609
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:20,420
薩羅
Saroo!

610
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,760
你必須面對現實
You need to face reality!

611
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,980
你說的現實是什麼意思
What do you mean? Reality?

612
01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:31,950
你能想像我的心情嗎  知道自己親哥哥
You have any idea what it's like knowing my real brother...

613
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:35,390
和母親每一天都在找我
and mother spend everyday of their lives looking for me?

614
01:15:37,890 --> 01:15:40,690
我的親哥哥每天怎樣呼喊著我的名字
How every day my real brother screams my name!

615
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:44,010
你能想像
Can you imagine the pain

616
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:46,700
他們不知道我的下落的痛苦嗎
they must be in for not knowing where I am?

617
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:50,220
25年  露西  25年了
25 years, Luce. 25!

618
01:15:51,810 --> 01:15:54,170
你為什麼不告訴我這些心結
Why didn't you tell me that's was happening for you?

619
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:58,210
我們在優越的生活中  放縱享受著
And we swung about in our privileged lives.

620
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:02,250
那讓我覺得噁心
It makes me sick.

621
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:04,680
我必須找到家
I have to find home.

622
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:06,950
他們必須知道  好嗎
They need to know, okay?

623
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:08,960
我從未阻攔過你
I've never stopped you.

624
01:16:09,490 --> 01:16:10,660
我想幫忙
I want to help.

625
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:12,230
我不能再這樣下去了
I can't do this anymore.

626
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:14,460
你值得更好的
You deserve more.

627
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:16,360
別這樣
Don't you do that!

628
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:22,000
你不能這樣  這都是你錯  可不怪我
Don't you dare do that! This is on you, not on me.

629
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,700
薩羅  你在嗎  夥計
Saroo, you there, mate?

630
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,730
明天是單日國際板球賽
It's One Day International tomorrow.

631
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:33,200
你想來的話就來吧
You can come over if you like?

632
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:37,330
我是想告訴你  我修好了船柄
I meant to tell you, I fixed the tiller.

633
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:41,040
我們為什麼不帶它出去  我們可以開去海岸
Why don't we take her out? We can head up the coast?

634
01:19:45,370 --> 01:19:46,510
嘿  薩羅
Hey, Saroo...

635
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:49,140
夥計  你媽媽她不...
Mate, your mum's not, um,

636
01:19:50,710 --> 01:19:53,280
聽著  我們找不到曼塔希  他又失蹤了
look, we've lost track of Mantosh, he's missing again.

637
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,050
你知道她有多擔心
You know how worried she gets.

638
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:06,630
我們知道你辭了工作  夥計
We know you quit your job, mate.

639
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:09,560
我們很擔心你  兒子
Just worried about you, son.

640
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,240
我最近時不時就去看看它
I've been visiting her.

641
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:58,820
每天晚上我順著那些街道走回家
Every night I walk those streets home.

642
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:01,480
從壩上走回家
Home from the dam.

643
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:03,750
從車站走回家
Home from the station.

644
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:06,850
我現在知道了...
I know now...

645
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,920
路上走的每一步
...every single step of the way.

646
01:21:12,830 --> 01:21:14,030
我想像著...
And I imagine that I'm...

647
01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:18,060
我在它耳旁輕語
...whispering in her ear...

648
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:20,770
我在這  沒事了
I'm here, it's alright.

649
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:24,700
她是什麼樣的
What was she like?

650
01:21:26,910 --> 01:21:27,910
很美
Beautiful.

651
01:21:33,710 --> 01:21:34,710
紐約怎麼樣
How was New York?

652
01:21:35,450 --> 01:21:36,450
都一樣
It's the same.

653
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:39,850
所以  你為什麼回來了
So, what brings you back?

654
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:43,120
我拿到經費了
My funding came through.

655
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:45,420
太棒了
It's great!

656
01:21:45,730 --> 01:21:46,730
看吧
See...

657
01:21:47,430 --> 01:21:48,730
他們知道你有多棒
They know how good you are.

658
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:02,840
我很想你
I miss you.

659
01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:06,810
我見到你媽媽了
I saw your mom.

660
01:22:08,350 --> 01:22:10,380
她不是很好
She's not doing very well.

661
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:14,510
我擔心  如果我告訴她我在找家她會崩潰的
I'm worried, it would kill her if she knew I was searching.

662
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:16,720
你低估她了
You underestimate her.

663
01:22:17,690 --> 01:22:18,690
她需要你
She needs you.

664
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:33,320
不  給我5盧比  我把這些都搬走
No, give me five rupees then I'll carry them all

665
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:37,410
好吧  你贏了  拿著吧
Okay, you win, take this

666
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,630
他當時搬著西瓜  沒看到車過來
He was carrying a watermelon and didn't see it coming

667
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:10,710
怎麼了
What?

668
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:15,750
如果你找到了家  他們卻都不在了怎麼辦
What if you do find home and they're not even there?

669
01:23:19,090 --> 01:23:21,350
你還會不停地去搜尋嗎
And you never stop and keep searching?

670
01:23:23,690 --> 01:23:25,680
你不知道過了這麼久發生了什麼
And you don't know what happens over time,

671
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:29,800
世事變遷  整個世界都在變
things change, and entire worlds change.

672
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:32,500
我別無選擇
I don't have a choice.

673
01:23:47,550 --> 01:23:48,580
留下來
Stay.

674
01:23:53,850 --> 01:23:55,350
我不能
I can't.

675
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:18,850
站在那別過來
Stay right there

676
01:24:20,270 --> 01:24:22,160
你不是應該照顧好他的嗎
Weren't you supposed to look after him?

677
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:24,610
你去哪了
Where were you?

678
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:26,450
你不愛他了嗎
Don't you love him?

679
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:53,290
約翰和曼塔希乘船出去了
John heard Mantosh is out on the boats.

680
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:00,590
去抓龍蝦了
Doing a lobster run.

681
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:09,340
他明天回來
He's due back tomorrow.

682
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:16,640
所以他會賺很多的現金  又要整天喝酒了
So he'll be flushed with cash, back on the hard stuff.

683
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:24,290
我很抱歉你不能有自己的孩子
I'm sorry you couldn't have your own kids.

684
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:28,820
你說什麼
What are you saying?

685
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:29,890
我們
We...

686
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:31,820
我們
We...

687
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:35,830
並不是白紙一張
weren't blank pages, were we?

688
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:38,270
像你親生的孩子那樣
Like your own would have been.

689
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,570
你領養的不只是我們  也領回了我們的過去
You weren't just adopting us but our past as well.

690
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:49,910
-我感覺我們在害死你  -我可以生孩子的
- I feel like, we're killing you. - I could have had kids.

691
01:25:53,110 --> 01:25:54,110
什麼
What?

692
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:55,650
我們選擇不生孩子
We chose not to have kids.

693
01:25:58,220 --> 01:25:59,790
我們想要你們兩個
We wanted the two of you.

694
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:02,730
那才是我們想要的
That's what we wanted.

695
01:26:03,690 --> 01:26:07,310
我們想要你們兩個出現在我們的生活裡
We wanted the two of you in our lives.

696
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:08,970
那是我們的選擇
That's what we chose.

697
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:19,920
那也是我愛上你爸爸的原因之一
That's one of the reasons, I fell in love with your dad.

698
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:22,980
因為我們都覺得
Because we both felt, as if...

699
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,680
這世界上的人已經夠多了
... the world has enough people in it.

700
01:26:30,550 --> 01:26:33,490
生個孩子  並不保證任何事會變得更美好
Have a child, couldn't guarantee it will make anything better.

701
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,670
但是接受一個像你們這樣處於困境的孩子
But to take a child that's suffering like you boys were.

702
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:41,130
給你們一個機會
Give you a chance in the world.

703
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:44,730
那意義非凡
That's something.

704
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:47,730
我猜你們從來沒想過會有這麼困難
I bet you never imagined it being this hard.

705
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:49,800
這並不是困難的問題
It's not a matter of hard.

706
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:51,610
這不是...
It's not a mat...

707
01:26:56,410 --> 01:26:58,280
我只有這一條路可以走
There's only one path for me.

708
01:26:59,150 --> 01:27:00,380
我是這麼想的
And, that's how I think.

709
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:04,020
之所以會這樣是因為...
That's how this happened because...

710
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:08,860
在我歲12的時候
When I was 12,

711
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:10,860
我看到過一個幻象
I had a vision.

712
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:22,140
有些人會說那是精神崩潰  但是...
Some people would say, it was a breakdown. But it...

713
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,710
我父親是個酒鬼  你知道的  就好像
My dad was an alcoholic. You know that, and he was like

714
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:30,930
他不是一個好人
he wasn't a good man.

715
01:27:30,930 --> 01:27:34,680
他那時失去了理智
He was out of control when I was...

716
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:39,100
而我當時站在屋後
I was standing at the back of the house.

717
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:40,890
我眺望著田野
I was looking out across this field.

718
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:46,430
希望這世界將我吞沒
And I just wanted the earth to swallow me up.

719
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:49,630
我...
And I...

720
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:59,370
我感受到一股電流  像是被電了一下
I felt an electric current, it was like a shock,

721
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:01,510
好像我渾身上下都在震顫
like a jolt through my whole body.

722
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:03,810
後來我看見...
And then I saw...

723
01:28:04,210 --> 01:28:05,710
一個棕色皮膚的孩子
a brown skinned child

724
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:07,680
穿過田野
across that field.

725
01:28:13,290 --> 01:28:15,160
他站在我的身邊
And he was standing beside me.

726
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:20,050
就在那裡  我很強烈地感覺到了
And it was right there and I could feel it so strongly.

727
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:26,500
我人生中第一次感受到了美好的東西
And for the first time in my life I felt something good...

728
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:29,880
我感覺很愉快
I felt good.

729
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:34,680
我知道那是在指引我
And I knew it was guiding me.

730
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:37,710
我知道我會沒事的
And I knew that I was going to be fine.

731
01:28:40,710 --> 01:28:45,280
那一刻我仿佛看到了我的未來  就在眼前
It was, as if, that moment I could see my future, right there!

732
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:50,690
因為我一直以為我可以把這個家聚在一起
Because I always thought that I could keep this family together.

733
01:28:51,730 --> 01:28:52,730
現在...
And now...

734
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:55,130
現在我也不知道了
Now I don't know.
