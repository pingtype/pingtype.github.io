00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,190
和那天公交車上的不一樣
It looks different from the bus.

137
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,900
- 很漂亮 - 謝謝
- It's nice. - Thank you.

138
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,430
你不用感到緊張
Yeah. You shouldn't feel insecure about it

139
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,900
或者不好意思  它..
or self conscious, it's--

140
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,600
是個很美的髮型
is a good haircut.

141
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,970
呃 你先看看菜單
Uh. Why don't you take a look at the menu

142
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,740
我去拿水來
and I will go grab your water.

143
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,050
好的 派
Yeah. Pie.

144
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,650
蘋果派
Apple pie.

145
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,910
您吃的怎麼樣？
How's it going over here?

146
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,510
- 賽斯 - 什麼？
- Seth. - What's that?

147
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,150
賽斯 我的名字叫賽斯
Seth. My name is Seth.

148
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,110
食物怎麼樣 賽斯？
How's the food, Seth?

149
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,620
很美味 很不錯
It's good. It's quality.

150
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,590
實際上 我有個問題想問你
Actually, I had a question for you.

151
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,150
你喜歡Ben folds嗎？
Do you like Ben folds?

152
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,920
我有兩張他本周音樂會的票
'Cause I have a couple of tickets to his concert this week

153
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,190
本來要和我去的那女孩
and the girl i was gonna go with--

154
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,490
不是我女朋友
not a girlfriend or anything--

155
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,930
她有事 沒法去了
she can't make it, she has a thing.

156
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,530
我在想  如果你想去的話...
I was wondering if maybe you'd wanna...

157
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,100
抱歉 我去不了
- Go? - I'm sorry, I can't.

158
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,770
我不喜歡自己一個人去看表演
I don't like going to shows by myself,

159
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,840
那樣感覺有點奇怪 你懂的 所以也許...
it feels kind of strange, you know, so maybe...

160
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,640
這不是什麼大事兒  不需太多顧慮
Not a big deal, no pressure.

161
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,210
咱們只是去看看  不是約會什麼的
We could just go. It wouldn't have to be a date or anything.

162
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,680
關鍵是 我已經有男朋友了 所以...
The thing is, I already sort of have a boyfriend, so...

163
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,980
不 你沒有
No, you don't.

164
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,950
我把賬單擱這兒了
I'm just gonna leave this here.

165
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,120
感謝光臨
Thanks for coming in.

166
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,960
稍等...一下
Hang on a second.

167
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,100
嘿
Hey.

168
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,100
- 外面有個男的 - 哦 性感嗎？
- There's a guy out there. - Ooh, is he hot?

169
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,000
我說真的  克萊爾
I'm serious, Claire.

170
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,740
別疑神疑鬼的 霍莉
Don't get paranoid on me, hol.

171
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,640
疑神疑鬼的時候就沒意思了
You're no fun when you're paranoid.

172
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,040
罷了
Never mind.

173
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,250
賭十塊錢是他掛的
Ten bucks says it's him.

174
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,680
- 喂  埃裏克 - 嘿 寶貝
- Yes, Eric. - Eric: Hey, babe.

175
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,220
- 你想怎樣？ - 天啊 這什麼態度
- Holly: What do you want? - Eric: Jesus, what's with the attitude?

176
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,820
我只想和你說說話  我一直都在想你
I just wanted to talk. I've been thinking about you.

177
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,390
他是不是又喝醉了 多愁善感的？
Is he drunk and weepy again?

178
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,260
一點點
A little bit.

179
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,060
你在和誰說話？和誰在一起是嗎？
Eric: Who are you talking to? You with someone?

180
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,100
別疑神疑鬼的  埃裏克
Don't get paranoid on me, Eric.

181
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,830
疑神疑鬼的時候就沒意思了
You're no fun when you're paranoid.

182
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,040
要再去陪埃裏克一晚嗎？
Claire: So the other night with Eric?

183
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,850
真的嗎？我們還能回到過去嗎？
Really? Are we gonna go there again?

184
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,720
好兩年了 你別跟我說他不重要
He was two years, you can't convince me he never mattered.

185
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,290
我是認真的 霍莉
I'm serious, though, hol.

186
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,960
孤獨可不好受
Being alone is just kinda shitty.

187
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,890
那還能怎樣  要我把他做過的一切都忘了嗎？
So, what, I'm just supposed to forget everything he did?

188
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:11,200
是的 忘記 原諒 向前看
Yes. Forget, forgive. Move the fuck on already.

189
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,830
回到原來的樣子
Just go back to the way things were.

190
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,870
你知道 我做不到
You know i can't do that.

191
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,280
敬我們
To us.

192
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,020
嘿 薩姆
Hey, Sam.

193
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,090
- 有人很受歡迎喲 - 什麼？
- Someone's popular. - What?

194
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,060
我們把它放在休息室裏了
We put it in the break room.

195
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,400
好的...
Okay...

196
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:08,390
走運了 婊子 老實交代 他是誰？
Lucky, bitch. Spill. Who's the guy?

197
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,100
- 嘿 - 嘿
- Hey. - Hey.

198
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,440
聽 我很抱歉那天晚上醉酒後給你打電話
Listen, I'm so sorry for the drunk dial the other night.

199
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,140
我意思是 你知道怎麼回事
I mean, you know how it is.

200
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,780
是啊 我知道
Yeah, I do.

201
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,080
來瓶啤酒還是其它喝的？
Listen, can I get you a beer or something?

202
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,320
埃裏克 你必須停止做這樣的事情
Eric, you have to stop doing stuff like this.

203
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,250
什麼樣的事情？
Stuff like... What now?

204
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,360
別裝了 那些玫瑰？你知道我最喜歡的
Come on. Roses? You know they're my favorite.

205
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,290
我懵了
I didn't know that.

206
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:52,400
好吧 算我傻
Okay. Well, now I just feel stupid.

207
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,530
- 就喝一瓶 - 我該走了
- Well-- just one beer. - I should go.

208
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:01,210
也沒那麼不堪回首對嗎？我們有過一些好時光
It wasn't all bad, right? We had some good times.

209
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,210
是的
Yep.

210
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,980
所以為什麼不再給一次機會呢？
So why don't we give it another shot?

211
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,350
你真的要我說出她的名字嗎？
Are you really gonna make me say her name?

212
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,790
太蠢了
Eric: This is so fucking stupid.

213
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,160
我意思是 咱曾經確實有過不快
I mean, we had something.

214
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,230
曾經
Had.

215
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,800
埃裏克 都是過去的事了
Eric, past tense.

216
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,340
我出去呼吸一下新鮮空氣
I'm gonna get some air.

217
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,060
夜色不錯
Seth: Nice night.

218
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,100
- 是的 - 是的
- Yeah. - Yep.

219
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,570
- 不吸煙嗎？- 我？不吸
- Not a smoker? - Me? No.

220
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,140
那很好
That's good.

221
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,980
永遠別嘗試  這是個壞習慣
Don't ever start, it's a terrible habit.

222
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,010
好的 我不會的
Okay, I won't.

223
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,320
謝謝
Thanks.

224
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,600
- 今宵愉快 - 你喜歡那些花嗎？
- Have a nice night. - You like the flowers?

225
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,640
你看起來像喜歡紅白玫瑰的那種女孩
You seemed like a red and white roses kind of girl.

226
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,240
我只是猜猜而已
It was just a guess.

227
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,340
哦 天哪 你是那天來餐廳的那個男的
Oh, my god. You're that guy from the restaurant.

228
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,980
我叫賽斯
Seth.

229
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,310
你在幹什麼 跟蹤我嗎？
What are you, like, following me or something?

230
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,010
什麼？不是..只是..
What? No. Just...

231
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,250
聽著 我不是變態 明白嗎？
Look, I'm not some psycho, okay?

232
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,890
你知道我 我們在同一所學校上過學
You know me. We went to school together.

233
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,250
你想幹什麼？
What do you want?

234
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,520
我什麼也不要  只想和你聊聊天
I don't want anything. I just want to talk to you.

235
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,560
當我那天在公交車上看到你的時候
When I saw you on the bus the other day,

236
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,960
經過這麼多年後  我對你產生了感覺
after all these years, i felt something.

237
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,230
我知道你也有
I know you did.

238
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,030
我無法擺脫那種感覺
I can't just walk away from that.

239
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,940
- 我根本不瞭解你 - 但你會瞭解
- I don't even know you. - But you will.

240
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,170
- 你可以走 我只是...我能和你聊聊嗎？- 不行
- You can go, I just-- can I just talk to you? - No.

00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,410
- 嘿 等等 - 不要  不要碰我
- Hey, hang on. - Don't! Don't touch me.

242
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,610
滾開！你在跟我開玩笑嗎？
Move! Are you kidding me?

243
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:17,610
我只想和你聊聊
Seth: Just let me talk to you.

244
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,180
去你媽的！

245
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,580
- 請聽我解釋 - 他媽的..
- Just let me explain. - Eric: What the fuck?

246
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,010
- 他想佔我便宜 - 什麼？我沒有

247
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,920
嘿 那不是真的 哥們
Hey, that is not true at all, man.

248
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,650
滾出去
Fuck off.

249
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,220
- 他傷到你嗎？- 我沒事
- Did he hurt you? - I'm fine.

250
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,360
你覺得這很好玩嗎
You think this is funny?

251
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,930
埃裏克 停下 停下來
Eric, stop. Stop it.

252
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,700
- 停下 - 算你走運 混蛋

我來搞定
Let me handle this.

254
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,570
離她遠點
Get the fuck away from her.

255
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,270
別讓我在這裏再看到你
Don't you ever come back here.

256
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,530
也許該原路折返找找
Maybe if you retrace your steps.

257
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,300
不 它應該在這兒某個地方的
No. It's gotta be here somewhere.

258
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,500
上面有你的名字嗎？
Well, was your name in it?

259
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,530
或是聯繫方式之類的？
Or like any contact information?

260
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,300
你覺得呢？
What do you think?

261
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:35,300
翻譯：SystemNT-ch@subhd.com

262
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,020
臭婊子！
You fucking bitch!

263
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,810
克萊爾？你在嗎？
Claire? You here?

00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,270
噓
Shh.

265
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:55,070
我給你注射的叫巴夫龍
What I just put in you is called pancuronium bromide.

266
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,380
一種麻醉劑 有點疼
It's a paralyzing agent. It stings a little.

267
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:03,210
不要擔心 無害的 我在自己身上試驗過
Don't worry, it's safe. I tested it on myself.

268
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,090
你來這裏幹什麼？
What you doing here?

269
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,960
哦 老闆娘半夜打電話

gotta make a delivery.

271
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,160
別急 哥們
Not so fast, man.

272
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,830
先簽個名
Sign in.

273
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,870
好的
Right.

274
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,090
- 不好意思 - 那是什麼？
- Excuse me. - The hell's that?

275
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:17,460
我想是滅虱粉
I think it's delousing powder.

276
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,190
好了 回頭見
All right, see you later.

277
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,730
- 你聽到了嗎？- 什麼？
- You hear that? - What?

278
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,440
- 有什麼不對勁嗎？- 噓
- Something wrong? - Shh.

279
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,190
- 你聽到什麼了嗎？- 安靜 哥們
- You hear something? - Quiet, man.

280
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,320
你也聽到了對嗎？
You heard that, right?

281
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,730
那個「呃」的聲音
That "uh" sound.

282
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:57,930
我啥也沒有聽到 是什麼？
I don't hear anything. What is it?

283
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:12,380
他媽的 是空調響
Fucking, ac, man.

284
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,440
總是出問題
Shit's always going out.

285
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:16,810
哦 可以了 可以了
Oh, I got it. I got it.

286
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,350
- 它壞了嗎？- 經常壞
- It's broken? - It's always broken.

287
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,890
- 這整個地方都很爛 - 好的
- This whole place sucks. - All right.

288
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,020
閉嘴
Shut up.

289
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:54,310
我是賽斯
So, I'm Seth.

290
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:56,010
怕你忘記了
In case you forgot.

291
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,280
去你媽的
Fuck you.

292
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,020
你自己選擇
Your choice.

293
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,520
- 去你媽的！- 我這樣做是為你好
- Fuck you! - I'm doing this for your own good.

294
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,230
我們明天再試試看
We'll try this again tomorrow.

295
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,630
去你媽的！
Fuck you!

296
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,150
去你媽的！
Fuck you!

297
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:02,600
嗨
Seth: Hi.

298
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,210
我給你帶了些水
I brought you some water.

299
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,280
給
Here.

300
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,450
喝
Drink this.

301
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,760
呼吸 呼吸 呼吸 坐起來
Breathe, breathe, breathe. Sit up.

302
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,630
抱歉
Sorry.

303
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:30,560
放輕鬆 沒事的
Take it easy. It's okay.

304
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,800
我也帶了些食物來
I brought food as well.

305
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,200
怕你餓了
In case you feel up for it.

306
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,400
水 食物
Water, food.

307
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,510
放輕鬆點 沒事的
Just take it easy, all right.

308
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,210
這些是你今天所有的食物
That's all you're getting today.

309
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,580
等等  請不要離開我
Wait! Please don't leave me.

310
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,790
我知道這很艱難
I know this is hard.

311
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,260
我也不好受
It's hard for me too.

312
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,530
但重要的是明確咱們之間的關係
But it's important to define our relationship.

313
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,100
設立一些界限
Establish some boundaries.

314
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,200
你這樣不管用的
This. This doesn't work.

315
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:16,310
這就對了
That's right.

316
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,410
我明天回來  到時我們再開始
I'll come back tomorrow. And we'll get started.

317
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,240
他會殺了你的
He's gonna kill you.

318
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,840
但你也知道
But you know that.

319
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,380
可能他會害怕起來
Maybe he'll lose his nerve, huh?

320
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,920
臨陣退縮
Chicken out.

321
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,290
或者某天他厭倦了
Or maybe he'll just get bored.

322
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,350
你說這些無濟於事
You're not helping.

323
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:37,660
他根本不需要槍  霍莉
He won't even need a gun, Holly.

324
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:40,260
他只需要離開這兒 你就死定了
All he has to do is walk away.

325
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,690
閉嘴
Shut up.

326
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,430
看看你
Claire: Look at you.

327
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,230
你要坐等他來抽你嗎？
You're letting him beat you?

328
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:51,900
等那個傻逼來抽你嗎？
That pathetic little shit?

329
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,500
如果你這麼容易屈服的話
If that's all it takes,

330
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,440
那麼也許你該被關在這裏
then maybe you deserve to be in there.

331
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,340
閉嘴！
Shut up!

332
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:16,450
你會強姦我嗎？
Are you gonna rape me?

333
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,720
不會
Seth: No.

334
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:22,530
殺了我？
Kill me?

335
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:23,830
我希望不會
I hope not.

336
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:29,800
你希望不會？
You hope not?

337
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,540
可能到時候我別無選擇
Might not have a choice.

338
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:37,070
為什麼？
And why's that?

339
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,980
我可能沒法救你
I might not be able to save you.

340
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:46,980
這是什麼意思 和宗教相關的原因嗎？
What is this, some kind of fucking religious thing?

341
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:50,050
是上帝讓你來懲罰所有的妓女之類的說辭嗎？
Did god tell you to punish all the whores, something like that?

342
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:54,790
這是一種不同類型的拯救
It's a different kind of saving.

343
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:57,280
- 不是宗教原因 - 所以呢 你只是個死變態而已
- And, no. - So what, you're just a sick fuck?

344
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,530
這是你取樂的方式？
This is how you get your kicks?

345
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:00,400
我這樣做不是為了我自己
I'm not doing this for me.

346
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,440
而是為了你
I'm doing this for you.

347
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,000
因為你很特別
Because you're special.

348
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:10,610
特別？
Special?

349
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:12,380
這是真的
It's true.

350
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:18,650
遇見你之前 我只是漂浮在人海中生活
Before I met you, i was just floating through life.

351
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:21,590
任何時候都可能迷失
Like any minute, i could just drift off.

352
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:24,990
沒有人會在意
No one would even notice.

353
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:27,890
然後你出現了
Then you came along.

354
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:31,730
關鍵是...
And the thing--

355
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:34,500
讓事情變得如此艱難的關鍵是..
the thing that made it so hard is,

356
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,900
我覺得你與眾不同
is I thought you were different.

357
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,740
你聰明 風趣
You're smart. Funny.

358
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:43,810
當你跟我說話時 你在看著我
When you talked to me, you saw me,

359
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:46,710
你真的看著我
you really saw me.

360
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:50,910
那只是你想讓我看到的一面 對嗎？
That's just what you wanted me to see, huh?

361
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:56,120
大家看得到的那個版本的霍莉
The version of Holly you are when everyone's watching.

362
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,890
但我們都知道那不是真的 不是嗎？
But we both know that's a lie, don't we?

363
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,830
去死吧
Go to hell.

364
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:05,730
這是問題所在
That's the question.

365
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:07,600
哪一個才是真正的霍莉？
Which one's the real Holly?

366
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,600
表面的霍莉還是另一個霍莉
The Holly on the outside or the other Holly.

367
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,810
因為如果有機會我可以救你
Because if there's even a chance I can save you,

368
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:16,410
我必須抓住它
I have to take it.

369
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,910
但如果你繼續頑固下去  沒什麼值得救的
But if that's it, if there's nothing left to save,

370
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,650
那麼你永遠不可能離開這個房間
then you're never leaving this room.

371
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:36,860
你在這裏幹什麼？
Nate: What you doing here?

372
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,860
哥們 如果讓他們抓到你在裏面搞事怎麼辦
Man, if they catch you fucking around them tunnels.

373
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:42,430
他們抓不到我  我不會進去的
They won't catch me, I'm not going in there.

374
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,970
去拿個拖把
Just grab a mop.

375
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:45,840
外面臭的跟狗屎一樣
We got that place smellin' like dog shit out there.

376
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,170
媽的
Shit.

377
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,060
那個傻子真可笑
This fuckin' dude is a joke.

378
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,630
那麼...
Claire: So...

379
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:15,600
你現在打算怎麼辦？
What are you gonna do now?

380
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,070
等..
I'm gonna wait.

381
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:22,070
好女孩
Claire: Good girl.

382
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:43,930
這真是一本讓人癡迷的書
Seth: It's a real page-Turner.

383
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:50,730
你真是一個作家 你知道嗎？
You're a hell of a writer, you know that?

384
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,240
你是個小偷
You're a thief.

385
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,040
現在要怎麼樣？
And now what?

386
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,240
突然間 你就琢磨透我了
Suddenly, you got me all figured out.

387
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,550
我希望如此  但沒有
I wish. No.

388
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,720
我主要是為你感到可憐
Mostly I just felt sorry for you.

389
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:11,220
你？你可憐我？
You? Felt sorry for me?

390
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:14,690
是啊 就是你談論愛情的那一部分
Yeah, it's the part where you talk about love.

391
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:17,090
「愛只是我們生理必然性的
"Love is just a label

392
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,900
一個標籤而已」
for our biological imperatives."

393
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,300
我不明白  我覺得這很愚蠢
I don't know. Felt ignorant to me.

394
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,770
你真的要給我講解愛情嗎 賽斯？
Are you really gonna lecture me on love, Seth?

395
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:27,770
你現在正把一個女孩關在籠子裏
You're keeping a girl in a cage.

396
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:32,880
我想我終於想清楚了
I think I finally figured it out.

397
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,850
所有那些把愛情比作
All these people who talk about love

398
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:38,750
天空閃電的人
like it's this lightning bolt from the sky.

399
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:41,220
這種不可抗力的
This irresistible force.

400
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:44,320
我可從來沒有那麼認為
So you think, well, I've never felt that.

401
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,820
那些人是錯誤的
But those people are wrong.

402
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:49,830
愛不是一道閃電
Love is not a lightning bolt.

403
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:53,130
愛是...真愛
Love is, real love,

404
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:56,070
需要努力付出
takes work.

405
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:58,000
需要犧牲
Sacrifice.

406
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,940
真愛就是為對方付出你的所有
Real love is giving everything you have to someone else.

407
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:05,710
- 那才是愛 - 他媽的開玩笑嗎？
- That's love. - Fucking kidding me?

408
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:07,210
你不這樣認為嗎？
You don't think?

409
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:09,350
「愛是犧牲」？
"Love is sacrifice"?

410
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:13,880
你知道誰相信這話嗎？那些討厭自己的人
You know who believes that? People who hate themselves.

411
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:17,620
那些和你一樣孤獨壓抑的人
Who are alone, depressed. Just like you.

412
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,790
- 你認為我討厭我自己？ - 我知道你是這樣的
- You think I have myself? - I know you do.

413
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:21,760
你如此厭惡自己  你甚至不敢想像
You hate yourself so much, you can't even imagine

414
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,090
什麼樣的鳥人才會接受你的愛
how fucked up someone would have to be to love you back.

415
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,330
所以你說服自己愛是一個可以買到的東西
So you convince yourself that love is this thing that you can buy.

416
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:30,800
你要做的就是不斷地給予
That all you have to do is keep giving.

417
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,270
就像我說的  我是在為你感到可憐
Well, like I said, i just feel sorry for you.

418
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:34,740
別他媽把可憐用到我身上
Spare me the fucking pity,

419
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:37,140
我不是這裏孤獨的那一個人
I'm not the one who's alone here.

420
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,710
噢  我想也不是
Oh, I guess not.

421
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:49,790
克萊爾這些天怎麼樣？
And how is Claire these days?

422
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,090
你在說什麼？
What are you talking about?

423
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,400
有時我打開那扇門之前
You know, sometimes before I open that door,

424
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,260
我聽到你在這裏面說話
I can heard you talking in here

425
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:03,800
和克萊爾說話
to Claire.

426
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,640
你能發出兩種聲音
The way you do two voices

427
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,170
一開始的時候把我給嚇壞了
scared the hell out of me at first.

428
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:10,940
你在胡說八道
You don't know what you're talking about.

429
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,710
我知道的比你想像的更多
I know more than you think.

430
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:15,950
她在這裏嗎 現在？
Is she here, right now?

431
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,950
沒有
No.

432
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:24,190
她不是真的
She's not real.

433
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:25,960
你覺得我不知道嗎？
You don't think i know that?

434
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,390
我想你已經開始忘記了
I think you're starting to forget

435
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:30,260
別疑神疑鬼的 埃裏克
don't get paranoid on me, Eric.

436
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:34,130
疑神疑鬼的時候就沒意思了
You're no fun when you're paranoid.

437
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:36,330
你病了  霍莉
Seth: You're sick, Holly.

438
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:39,370
你通過不斷地吃來麻痹
Feeding that sickness until all it does is eat.

439
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:46,740
你都琢磨透了 對嗎？
You just have it all figured out, don't you?

440
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,150
幾乎
Almost.

441
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:53,750
有一件事我還不明白
One thing i still don't understand.

442
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:54,750
日記
The journal.

443
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:59,320
首先 我瞭解到你和埃裏克要訂婚了
First, I get it. You and Eric getting engaged.

444
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,190
吧啦 吧啦...
Blah, blah, blah.

445
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:03,960
但你最好的朋友出現了 克萊爾 真克萊爾
But here comes your best friend, Claire. The real Claire.

446
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:08,070
霍莉吃不下 霍莉睡不著
Holly can't eat. Holly can't sleep.

447
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:09,930
霍莉想要面對他們  但她太害怕了
Holly wants to confront them but Holly's too scared.

448
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,200
去你媽的
Fuck you.

449
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:19,380
然後到這裏 事情開始變得十分有趣
Then here. Here's where it gets really interesting.

450
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:22,780
（克萊爾）：我回到家後...
Claire: I get home and there's like

451
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,280
看到德懷恩發來的大概20個訊息
20 messages from Dwayne, right?

452
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,780
比如「你在哪裏？」
He's like, "where are you?

453
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,150
為什麼還沒來接我？「
Why haven't you picked me up yet?"

454
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,490
其實是他自己說過
Even though, he's the one who said

455
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:29,990
星期六會來接我的
that he was coming to get me on Saturday.

456
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:31,190
你知道 莫名其妙地
You know, somehow of course

457
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,920
它就變成了是我的錯
it's just magically my fault.

458
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:37,290
你會告訴我嗎？
Were you going to tell me?

459
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,760
告訴你什麼？
Tell you what?

460
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,270
別這樣 克萊爾 你懂的
Come on, Claire. You know.

461
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:46,040
嗯 不太懂
Um, not really.

462
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,840
埃裏克
Eric.

463
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,850
你怎麼發現的？
How'd you find out?

464
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:57,450
他的郵箱 他不知道我有密碼
His email. He doesn't know i have the password.

465
00:50:57,450 --> 00:51:00,120
- 糟糕 - 是的
- Shit - yeah.

466
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,490
霍莉 你讓我怎麼說？
Holly, what do you want me to say?

467
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:04,250
對不起
You know, I'm sorry.

468
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,990
我們喝的太醉了 可這並不意味著什麼
We were so drunk. And it didn't mean anything.

469
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:08,460
哦  既然這並不意味著什麼的話
Oh, well, as long as it didn't mean anything.

470
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,830
好了 霍莉 請減速
Okay, Holly, please slow the car down.

471
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:12,330
你讓我難以置信
You're unbelievable.

472
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,370
- 你知道嗎？- 對不起
- Do you know that? - I'm sorry.

473
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:18,100
你不知道我對那件事有多後悔
You have no idea how shitty I feel about this whole thing.

474
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,440
如果...該死的  請慢下來好嗎？
And if it-- damn it, please slow the car down, okay?

475
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,110
你本是我最好的朋友
You're supposed to be my best fucking friend.

476
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:24,210
霍莉 別這樣 天啊
Holly, come on. Jesus.

477
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,450
霍莉！該死的 你這樣會害死我們的
Holly! God damn it, you're gonna kill us.

478
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:04,510
哦 天哪  哦 我的天啊
Oh, my god. Oh, my fucking god.

479
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:10,920
我們沒事的 我沒事
We're okay. I'm all right.

480
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,590
我們會沒事的 霍莉
We're gonna be okay, Holly.

481
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,430
我們會沒事的 霍莉
We're okay, Holly.

482
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:20,330
我們會沒事的
We're gonna be fine.

483
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,000
我們會沒事的
We're gonna be okay.

484
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,500
我會沒事的
I'm gonna be fine.

485
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:52,900
你當那是什麼？
And you think that's what?

486
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:56,000
口供嗎？我是一個作家 賽斯
A confession? I'm a writer, Seth.

487
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,630
虛構是我的工作
Fiction's kind of what I do.

488
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:04,110
這就是為什麼我沒有直接報警的原因
Seth: That's why I didn't go straight to the police.

489
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:07,980
我必須確定一下
I had to be sure.

490
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,550
我跟蹤了你幾天
I thought I'd follow you around for a few days,

491
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:11,450
但你可沒有讓我久等
but you didn't make me wait long.

492
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,360
這麼做是有風險的
Seth: It was a risky move.

493
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,630
- （流浪漢）：不！- 即使你自己也是有危險的
- Homeless man: No! - Seth: Even for you.

494
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,580
這樣的事兒太多了
Seth: There were so many.

495
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:43,280
知道我怎麼想的嗎？
You want to know what I think?

496
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,950
我想你是希望自己被抓住
I think you wanted to get caught.

497
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:48,450
這就是為什麼你寫日記的原因
That's why you kept the journal.

498
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:51,250
您想要受到懲罰
You wanted to get punished.

499
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:53,420
所以我幸運地碰到了你
Lucky you came along .

500
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,600
你還不明白對嗎？
You don't get it, do you?

501
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,200
這不是懲罰
This isn't punishment.

502
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,970
我在試著拯救你
I'm trying to save you.

503
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,340
那就開始吧
Then do it.

504
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:10,540
拯救我
Save me.

505
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:17,280
我會的
I will.

506
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,980
我會的
I will.

507
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,640
我說到做到了
I meant what I said.

508
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:28,690
我會阻止你再去傷害他人
I'm gonna stop you hurting other people.

509
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:30,590
不管用什麼方法
One way or the other.

510
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:55,490
獲得奧斯卡獎的是...
And the Oscar goes to...

511
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:58,660
他想拯救我
He wants to save me.

512
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:01,390
我必須讓他相信有這樣的機會
I have to let him think there's a chance.

513
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:03,990
所以一切都是表演給他看嗎？
So that was all an act?

514
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,500
你剛只是在順水推舟？
You were just humoring him?

515
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,740
- 忽悠他... - 有話直說...
- Playing along... - If you've got something to say...

516
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:16,440
我只是想確定你是否還在繼續這場遊戲
I'm just making sure your head's still in the game.

517
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:21,610
我不需要多一次這樣無用的鼓勵 克萊爾
I don't need another useless pep talk, Claire.

518
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,610
我也不需要你
And I don't need you.

519
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,610
怎麼了？
Yes?

520
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:54,540
什麼？沒 沒什麼
What? No. Nothing.

521
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,720
只是好奇
Just was curious.

522
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,720
你為什麼要這樣做
Why you did it.

523
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:03,550
我想 當我看到埃裏克的電子郵件裏
I guess, when I saw Eric's email,

524
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,220
克萊爾發的那些消息
all those messages from Claire--

525
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,820
不 不是克萊爾的問題 我明白
no, not Claire. I understand that.

526
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:11,590
那是一種衝動型犯罪
It's a crime of passion or whatever.

527
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,130
我想知道為什麼你沒有就此停手
I wanna know why you didn't stop there.

528
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:16,200
為什麼要殺其他人
Why you killed the others.

529
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,470
因為你對克萊爾感到內疚
'Cause you feel guilty for what you did to Claire,

530
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:20,200
為了擺脫這種感覺而去做那些事兒
for getting away with it.

531
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,410
你想被抓住 不是嗎？
You wanted to get caught, didn't you?

532
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:25,510
不  因為我可以擺脫
No, because I could.

533
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:29,250
我不信
Yeah, I don't believe that.

534
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:31,650
我不在乎你信不信
Well, I don't care what you believe.

535
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:33,550
因為 聽著 事實是這樣的 賽斯
'Cause see, here's the thing, Seth.

536
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:35,690
當有人死在你面前 像克萊爾死的那樣
When someone dies in front of you, the way Claire died,

537
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:39,460
感覺世界瞬間清晰了
it's like you're whole world just snaps into focus.

538
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,360
求救嗎？
Cry for help?

539
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,590
這是一種打發時間的方式
It was a way to pass the time.

540
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,660
別裝作你很瞭解我
Don't pretend you know what I am.

541
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:47,360
你錯了 我的確瞭解你
You're wrong, i do know you.

542
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,300
我通過它瞭解你
I know you from this.

543
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:52,200
那個寫這些的女孩  她有夢想
And the girl who wrote this, you had dreams.

544
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,700
她關心其他人
She cared about people.

545
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:55,640
她害怕孤獨
Who's scared to be alone.

546
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,310
這才是真正的你
This is the real you.

547
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:00,440
不是..
Not...

548
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:08,490
賽斯有點愛上我了
Seth's got a little crush.

549
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,160
這不是關於我們的事兒
This isn't about us.

550
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,760
如果你愛某種東西 就給它自由
If you love something, set it free.

551
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,560
事情不就是這樣的嗎？
Isn't that how that goes?

552
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:20,630
你知道 我不能這樣做
You know I can't do that.

553
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:24,670
你知道把一頭大白鯊
Do you know what happens to a great white shark

554
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:28,470
扔到水族館裏會怎麼樣嗎？
when you put him inside an aquarium?

555
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:31,310
它會用自己的腦袋猛擊玻璃
It bashes its brains against the glass.

556
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:33,310
每次都會
Every time.

557
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:34,510
來吧
Come on.

558
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:37,180
停下 霍莉 停下！
Stop, Holly, stop!

559
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:38,880
停下 霍莉！
Stop, Holly!

560
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,620
你明天下來的時候會怎麼做
What are you gonna do when you come down here tomorrow

561
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:45,820
看到我直挺挺地死在這兒的時候
and I'm belly up in the tank, huh?

562
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,520
因為你沒法棄之不顧
'Cause you can't just walk away.

563
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:51,860
這裏到處都是你的指紋
Not with your finger prints all over the place.

564
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:56,500
我自殺了 你也會沒命
I kill myself, your life ends too.

565
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:06,210
所以把這作為咱們關係的界限如何
So how's that for the boundaries of our fucking relationship?

566
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:48,420
- 賽斯？- 嗯？
- Seth? - Hmm?

567
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:50,420
工作做完後到我辦公室來
Finish this up and come see me in my office.

568
00:58:56,930 --> 00:58:58,700
有什麼問題嗎？
Something wrong?

569
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:01,300
「有什麼問題嗎？」這正是我要問你的
"Is something wrong?" That's the question, isn't it?

570
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,340
我不太明白你說的
I'm not following you.

571
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,740
那些狗捨現在都髒兮兮的
The kennels are filthy.

572
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:08,340
我們儲藏室裏現在都有臭蟲了
We've got bugs up in the stock room.

573
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:11,670
但賽斯去哪兒了？他肯定沒來上過班
And where's Seth? He's not here, that's for sure.

574
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,680
內特說你兩天都沒來上班了
Nate says you haven't been here in two days.

575
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,980
甘迪夫人 內特幾乎不..
Mrs. gundy, Nate is hardly--

576
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:18,650
內特的工作做的很好
Nate does his job.

577
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:21,820
你也該做好你自己的工作
You should've done yours.

578
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:23,490
你要解雇我嗎？
You're firing me?

579
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:25,590
這次給你警示
Disciplinary notice.

580
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:26,960
並且記錄在永久檔案中
This goes in your permanent record.

581
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,330
再犯一次 立馬走人 明白嗎？
One more strike and you're gone. Understand?

582
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:30,560
明白  謝謝
Understood. Thank you.

583
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,500
你不知道這工作對我有多重要
You don't know how much this means to me.

584
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:41,300
這是將要發生在你身上的事情
This, this is what's gonna happen to you

585
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:42,740
當你認為自己在掌控之中
when you think you're in control.

586
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:45,940
你認為你在掌控之中 霍莉
You think you're in control, Holly.

587
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:50,480
好 這是將要發生的事情 當你認為你在..
Well, this is what'll happen when you think you're in--

588
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,880
我掌控著情況
-  I control the situation.

589
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,760
我來做一些維護工作
There's the man. Just doing some maintenance.

590
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,790
沒要求你來
Didn't ask.

591
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:10,700
嘿  賽斯 我這有你的工資單
Hey, Seth. I got your paycheck.

592
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:27,980
還健在 嗯？
Still here, huh?

593
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:33,860
其餘在哪裏？
Where's the rest?

594
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:39,030
沒有其餘的
There is no rest.

595
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:42,070
當你開始掌控自己的時候 事情就變這樣了
This is what happens when you start acting like you're in control.

596
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:43,830
這可不夠
That's not enough.

597
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,000
這不是由你決定的
You don't get to decide that.

598
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,900
去你的
Fuck you.

599
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:50,110
去我的？我為你操碎了心
Fuck me? I go through hell for you

600
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:52,080
而你在幹什麼  威脅我？
and what do you do, threaten me?

601
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,740
你再說這種話
You ever pull that shit again,

602
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,050
我要讓你體會一下真正的絕食是什麼感覺
I'll show you what a real hunger strike feels like.

603
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:58,650
去你的
Fuck you.

604
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:07,890
我昨晚做了個夢  夢中有你
I had a dream last night and you were in it.

605
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:11,490
只有咱們倆
It was just the two of us.

606
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:15,000
我們在水下的一個房子裏
And we were in this house down by the water.

607
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,630
我想 我們已經生活在那很長時間了
And I think we'd been living there a long time

608
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:18,030
因為那裏牆上掛著一些照片
'cause there were these pictures on the walls.

609
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,540
我們倆的照片
Pictures of us.

610
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:22,810
看著很奇怪
It was weird looking at them,

611
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:27,380
因為看著感覺挺好
because something about it felt right.

612
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:29,480
就像這裏 這整個世界就是一個夢
Like this, this whole world is a dream

613
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:33,520
而海灘上的那座房子是真的
and that house on the beach, that's reality.

614
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:37,690
事情原本應該是這樣的
That's how things are supposed to be.

615
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,500
也許我可以到自動售貨機
Seth: Maybe I can get you some snacks

616
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,770
給你買些點心
from the vending machine.

617
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:51,600
謝謝你 賽斯
Thanks, Seth.

618
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,820
我的老天啊
Holy shit.

619
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:23,260
牆上有個燈
There's a light on the wall.

620
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,830
嘿 你叫什麼名字？
Hey, what's your name?

621
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,270
嗯 我叫內特
Um, I'm Nate.

622
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:35,040
聽我說 內特
Listen to me, Nate.

623
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,170
你得找工具斷這鎖
You have to find something to break open this lock.

624
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,910
你能做到嗎？
Can you do that?

625
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:42,180
這亂糟糟的是怎麼...
What kind of fucked up...

626
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:44,850
- 是賽斯干的嗎？- 內特 現在沒時間想這些
- Did Seth do this? - Nate, there's no time for that right now.

627
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:08,840
好的 選好角度猛擊它
Okay, go at it hard, at an angle.

628
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,970
我們得打電話叫人  警察或什麼的
We gotta call somebody, the cops or whatever.

629
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,540
你得馬上把我放出去
You have to get me out of here right now.

630
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:30,730
繼續 試試
Holly: Keep going, try now.

631
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:32,160
我就是在這麼干
Nate: That's what I'm doing.

632
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:35,100
再使點勁
Harder.

633
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:37,330
這亂七八糟的
Nate: This is all fucked up.

634
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:40,270
好的 很棒
Okay, that's great.

635
01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:42,870
我數三下
Nate: Okay, on three. All right?

636
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:45,710
一 二 三
One, two, three.

637
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:52,010
等等
Hold on.

638
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,850
你知道什麼是真愛嗎 內特？
Do you know what real love is, Nate?

639
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:57,220
- 什麼？- 真愛
- What? - Holly: You know, real love.

640
01:04:57,220 --> 01:05:00,360
如果你愛過某人  但她生病了
Say you loved somebody. But she got sick.

641
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,160
然後某一天來了個人
And then someone came along one day

642
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,690
把她身上的管子拔掉
to pull the plug on her

643
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,760
從你身邊永遠帶走了她
to take her away from you forever.

644
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,930
你會怎麼做？
What would you do?

645
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:09,130
我不知道 我只是想把你放出來
Nate: I don't know, I just wanna get you outta here.

646
01:05:09,130 --> 01:05:10,330
你會採取一切辦法
Holly: You would do anything

647
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,300
阻止它發生
to stop that from happening.

648
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:14,140
任何方法 不計代價
Anything at all, no matter what the cost

649
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:17,770
因為那就是愛的本質
because that's what love is.

650
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:21,910
愛是犧牲
Love is sacrifice.

651
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:28,250
臥槽你？
What the fuck?

652
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:32,150
你完蛋了
You die.

653
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,720
噢
Oh.

654
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:36,390
你在刺我嗎？
Are you stabbing me?

655
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,930
混蛋
Motherfucker!

656
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:48,400
那塊磚 賽斯 用那塊水泥磚
The block, Seth. Use the cinder block.

657
01:05:48,410 --> 01:05:50,170
他還在動 快呀 搬起來
He's moving. Come on, use it.

658
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:52,380
- 我不能 - 你必須
- I can't. - You have to.

659
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:54,810
賽斯  我不能失去你
Seth, I can't lose you.

660
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:57,050
- 求求你？- 噢 操
- Please? - Nate: Oh, fuck.

661
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:03,720
我的腿沒知覺了
I can feel my leg.

662
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:07,920
他媽的
What the fuck?

663
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,800
救命啊
Somebody help me.

664
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:23,370
來 再來一遍
come on, do it again.

665
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,780
再來一次
One more time.

666
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:39,960
對不起 對不起 對不起
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

667
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:43,260
賽斯 你得聽我的 懂嗎？
Seth. You have to listen to me, okay?

668
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:45,390
你必須完全按我說的做
You have to do exactly what I say.

669
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,960
你在聽嗎？
Are you listening?

670
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,470
第一步：處理掉屍體
Okay, step one is disposing of the body.

671
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:51,070
越快越好
The sooner, the better.

672
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:53,270
燒了 埋了 沉水裏 怎麼都行
Okay, burn it, bury it, sink it, whatever.

673
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:54,740
只要把它弄出這裏就行
Just get it out of here.

674
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:56,210
但是在銷毀可能的線索前
But you can't do that

675
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:57,840
你不能這麼做
before you get rid of the identifiers.

676
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:00,310
牙齒 紋身 指紋
Teeth, tattoos, fingerprints.

677
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:03,210
指紋簡單 用角豆處理就行
The fingerprints are easy, you can use a carob for that.

678
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:05,250
牙齒要分散開來
After the teeth, you need to scatter them.

679
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:07,150
扔垃圾袋 或扔水中 怎樣都行
Dumpsters, in water, whatever.

680
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:09,820
只要不把全部扔在同一個地方就行
Just not all in the same place.

681
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:11,320
所以要考慮的只剩軀體了
And then there's just the body to worry about.

682
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:17,230
他這樣塞不進焚化爐
Seth: He's not gonna fit in the incinerator.

683
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:19,260
嗯  不可能
Holly: Well, not like that.

684
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,860
你要和我練習一下怎麼說嗎？
Holly: Do you want to practice with me what to say?

685
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,340
嗨 甘迪夫人 我是賽斯
Seth: Hey, Mrs. gundy, it's Seth.

686
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,410
抱歉這麼晚了給你打電話
Sorry to call you so late.

687
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:39,810
嗯 是的 內特叫我在前台看著
Um, yeah, Nate asked me to watch the front

688
01:08:39,810 --> 01:08:42,480
他出去辦點事 到現在還沒有回來
while he ran some errands and he's still not back yet.

689
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,050
我不知道他去哪兒了
I don't know where he went.

690
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:48,050
好的  晚安
Oh... Okay, good night.

691
01:08:48,050 --> 01:08:50,050
抱歉
Sorry.

692
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,370
你感覺怎麼樣？
How do you feel?

693
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:42,240
我不知道 感覺有點分裂
I don't know. Disconnected.

694
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,070
就像是發生在別人身上似的 你明白嗎？
Like it happened to someone else, you know?

695
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:47,110
第一次總是最糟糕的
The first time's always the worst.

696
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:49,510
不是什麼第一次 剛只是一個意外
There is no first time. It was an accident.

697
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:53,280
- 我告訴過你的 - 你知道是什麼促使我不斷這麼做嗎？
- I told you. - You know what always got to me?

698
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:55,120
問題就在這兒
It was the questions.

699
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,620
我記得一開始的時候
I remember in the beginning

700
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:59,990
我所想的都是如果她有個寵物怎麼辦？
all I could think about was what if she had a pet?

701
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:03,890
一隻可憐的小狗坐在門口
It's poor little doggie just sitting by the door

702
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:06,360
正等著她回家
waiting for her to come home.

703
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,900
但所有這一切都消失了
But all that goes away.

704
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:10,370
你想的越多
The more you think about it

705
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:13,240
越是會記起你喜歡的那些
the more you remember the parts that you liked.

706
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:15,000
當你掌控著自己的生活
How it made you feel.

707
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:16,670
那是一種什麼樣的感覺
Like you were in control of your life

708
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:19,310
第一次你感到什麼也傷害不了你
for the very first time, like nothing could hurt you.

709
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:20,540
不是那樣的
That's not how it was.

710
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:23,180
但唯一的問題是
But the only problem is

711
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:25,610
或早或晚 這一切又都恢復正常
that sooner or later it all goes back to normal.

712
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:31,390
突然間 你沒什麼特別的了 你只是你
All of a sudden you're nothing special, you're just you.

713
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:33,520
停下好嗎？
Stop, okay?

714
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,390
然後你就開始思考
Holly: And that's when you start to wonder.

715
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:39,090
要走多遠才能找回那種感覺
How far you'd have to go to get that feeling back.

716
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:40,530
這是不一樣的
It's not the same.

717
01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:44,700
接受自己真面目沒什麼可恥的 賽斯
There is no shame in accepting what you are, Seth.

718
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:46,200
我這麼做是為了我們的安全
I did it, to keep us safe.

719
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,440
我別無選擇
I had no choice.

720
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:50,440
你沒有想過為什麼...
Didn't you ever wonder why

721
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:54,380
世界上有這麼多女孩而你只喜歡我？
all the girls in the world but you get a hard on for me?

722
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:56,610
你會認為這是一個巧合嗎？
And you think that's, what, a coincidence?

723
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:01,650
你和我  咱們生來就是做這個的
You and me, we were born to do this.

724
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:04,050
別裝作你很瞭解我似的
Don't act like you know a goddamn thing about me.

725
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:06,990
我知道一個正常人發現他人的殺人自白書後
I know that a normal person finds a murder confession

726
01:11:06,990 --> 01:11:08,220
會去報警
and goes to the police.

727
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:09,430
而不是到寵物市場來
Not to petsmart.

728
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:11,560
哦 是的 我應該報警說「打擾一下 長官
Oh, yeah, "excuse me, officer.

729
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,730
你看到那女孩了嗎？那個女服務員？她就是少年漢尼拔
You see that girl over there, the waitress? She's Hannibal Lecter.

730
01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:16,330
我怎麼知道的？我闖進她家裏偷她東西發現的」
You know how I know? I broke into her apartment and stole her shit."

731
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:17,700
這能行嗎？
Think that'll work?

732
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:19,600
噢 那麼也可以說是綁架？
Oh, and so plan b is kidnapping?

733
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,440
「也可以說
'Cause the fucking alternative

734
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,540
我四處跟蹤你 坐著看你傷人」
was sitting around watching you hurt someone else.

735
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:26,480
嗯
Mm.

736
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,450
是啊  你沒有傷害過人
Good thing no one got hurt.

737
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:33,150
我告訴過你...我告訴過你
I told you... I told you.

738
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:34,220
這是一個意外
It's an accident.

739
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:36,750
面對它吧  賽斯
Face it, Seth.

740
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:40,490
這從來就不是拯救生命之類的事情 你會喜歡的
This was never about saving lives, you like this.

741
01:11:40,490 --> 01:11:43,160
你想要具備那種力量
You like having that kind of power.

742
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,730
決定誰生誰死
Deciding who lives, who dies.

743
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:49,370
霍莉 還不算太晚
Holly, it's not too late.

744
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:53,240
我可以拯救你的 拜託
I can save you, please.

745
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:57,210
拜託 我可以拯救你
Please. I can save you.

746
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:01,680
也許你不該拯救我
Maybe you're not supposed to save me.

747
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:09,320
也許是我該拯救你
Maybe I'm suppose to save you.

748
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:14,590
別 別
Don't, don't.

749
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:34,640
賽斯 請幫幫我 我很冷
Seth, please help me, I'm so cold.

750
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,310
來溫暖我
Please make me warm.

751
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:39,280
你可以幫我嗎 你能讓我溫暖嗎？
Can you help me, can you please make me warm?

752
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:47,690
我以為你愛我
I thought you love me.

753
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:51,590
我確實愛你
I do.

754
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:55,700
我真的愛你
I do love you.

755
01:12:58,070 --> 01:13:01,500
霍莉 霍莉
Holly. Holly.

756
01:13:05,810 --> 01:13:08,210
霍莉
Holly.

757
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:15,150
我會盡快回來的
I'll come back as soon as I can.

758
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:30,470
- 賽斯 - 哦
- Oh. - Seth.

759
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:32,370
這是偵探米拉
This is detective Mira.

760
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:34,600
有什麼事嗎？
Something wrong?

761
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:36,840
咱們找個地方聊聊吧？
Detective: Is there somewhere we can talk?

762
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:40,440
你和內特是同事對吧？
So, you work with Nathan, yeah?

763
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:41,840
是
Yes.

764
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:45,110
你最後一次見到他是什麼時候？
When's the last time you saw him?

765
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,220
週三 我想是 週三晚上
Wednesday, I think? Wednesday evening.

766
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:48,450
是的 他讓我來前台守著
Yeah, he asked me to cover the front

767
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:49,890
他要出去辦點事
while he ran some errands.

768
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:53,790
- 什麼樣的事？- 嗯 他沒有說
- What kind of errands? - Um, he didn't say.

769
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:56,630
嗯 那是大概...
Uh-huh. And this would be about...

770
01:13:56,630 --> 01:13:58,660
幾點？
What time?

771
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:00,660
九點 十點 差不多那段時間
9:00, 10:00. Something like that.

772
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:03,630
他是從前面離開的嗎？
He leave out through the front?

773
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:05,200
是
Yeah.

774
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,440
前門 你確定嗎？
The front door, you sure?

775
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,300
是的 怎麼了？
Yeah, why?

776
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:10,670
事情是這樣
Well, here's the thing.

777
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:14,710
前門是無鑰匙進出系統
The front door operates on a keyless entry system.

778
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:18,680
你也知道 每次進出都會有記錄
As you know, it records each instance in or out.

779
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:23,290
現在你猜最後一次有人開那門是什麼時候？
Now you wanna guess the last time someone opened that door?

780
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:26,190
四點 凌晨四點
4:00. That's 4:00 am.

781
01:14:26,190 --> 01:14:28,460
- 嗯 - 而你說是下午九點或十點？
- Huh. - And you said it was what, 9:00 or 10:00pm?

782
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:29,860
這有點奇怪 你不覺得嗎？
It's kind of weird, don't you think?

783
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:31,760
不 也許是我記錯了
No, maybe I'm remembering it wrong.

784
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:35,660
他可能是從側門走的 或倉庫走的
He could have left out the side door, or loading docks.

785
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:39,400
倉庫？哦 當然 是啊
Loading docks? Oh, sure. Yeah.

786
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:40,670
我應該去查一下的
I should check that out.

787
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:45,170
你和內特是朋友？
You and Nathan friends?

788
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:47,280
我們一起工作 他人挺好
Well, we worked together. He was a nice guy and all.

789
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,880
但他卻想讓上司解雇你..
Until he tried to get you fired.

790
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,250
什麼？事情不是這樣的
What? Oh. That is not what happened.

791
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:52,380
內特和我以前是朋友
Nate and i were friends.

792
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:54,280
哦 現在你們又是朋友了
Oh, now you're friends again.

793
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:56,790
或者你們以前是朋友 過去式
Or you were friends, past tense.

794
01:14:56,790 --> 01:14:59,290
這是你第二次這麼說
That's the second time you said that.

795
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:00,690
你知道有句俗話說
Well, you know what they say.

796
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:04,430
第一次是糊弄  第二次是招供
First time 's confusion, second time's confession.

797
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:05,590
這是幹什麼？
What's this about?

798
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,430
標準程序而已
Standard procedure.

799
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:09,600
所以他叫你替他看著
So now, he asked you to cover for him,

800
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,330
是星期三晚上 九點還是十點？
this is what Wednesday night, nine or ten?

801
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:13,700
他說過他要去哪裏嗎？
Did he say where he was going?

802
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:14,740
我想他是要去見某人
I think he had to meet someone.

803
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:16,840
他接了個電話
He got a phone call, something.

804
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:20,680
這很有趣 因為我們做的第一件事
It's funny, because the first thing we did

805
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:22,440
就是檢查電話記錄
was check the phone records.

806
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:25,950
最後一次和他通話的是他女友
And the last person he talked to was his girlfriend.

807
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:27,950
那天下午5:32
5:32 that afternoon.

808
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:30,980
嗨
Hi.

809
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:38,650
你得吃點東西
Gotta eat something.

810
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:46,960
霍利 別這樣
Holly, come on.

811
01:16:49,330 --> 01:16:52,830
快 快 不要這樣
Come on. Come on, don't do this.

812
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:24,070
現在我知道你在做什麼
Seth: Now I know what you're doing.

813
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:26,970
這沒用的
It's not gonna work.

814
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:31,740
求你和我說說話
Just talk to me, please.

815
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:40,450
結束了  賽斯
Holly: It's over, Seth.

816
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:45,350
我不明白
I don't understand.

817
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,590
因為如果你不能幫助我
Because if you can't help me

818
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:52,490
不能給我我需要的 那麼就沒人可以了
if you can't give me what I need, then no one can.

819
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:58,470
告訴我  告訴我你需要什麼
Tell me, tell me what you need.

820
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:03,570
你知道答案的
You know the answer.

821
01:18:03,570 --> 01:18:07,140
你把我放在一個籠子裏
You put me in a box.

822
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:10,010
這不是愛 這是佔有
That's not love, that's ownership.

823
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:16,550
你什麼也沒給
You didn't give me anything.

824
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:21,890
你所做的都是取
All you did was take.

825
01:18:21,890 --> 01:18:24,460
我不能讓你出去
I can't let you out.

826
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:28,400
- 你知道的 - 我沒有要求你放我出去
- You know that. - I didn't ask you to.

827
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,100
那麼你想要什麼？
Then what? What do you want?

828
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:37,540
一個證明
Proof.

829
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:41,680
證明？
Proof?

830
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:46,620
- 一根手指 - 什麼？
- A finger. - A what?

831
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:47,880
一根手指？
A finger?

832
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:52,750
我的手指？
My finger?

833
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:01,460
不
No.

834
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:05,430
不不不...
No. No. No. No.

835
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,570
這太扯了
This is fucked.

836
01:19:07,570 --> 01:19:09,670
你不明白嗎？
Can't you see that?

837
01:19:09,670 --> 01:19:13,040
這完全是在亂來
This is totally fucked.

838
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:16,580
不行  我正在努力拯救你
No. I'm trying to save you here.

839
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:18,110
我正在給你機會
And I'm trying to let you.

840
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,720
你不能要求我那麼做  霍莉
Well, you can't ask me for that, Holly.

841
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:22,180
我不會做的
And I'm not gonna do it.

842
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:29,160
我以前認為我是唯一的那個
I used to think i was the only one.

843
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:34,660
即使我是一個孩子時 我也知道
Even when I was a kid, i still knew.

844
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:35,930
如果他們發現了
That if they ever found out,

845
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:40,000
我的家人  我的朋友們...
my family, my friends...

846
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,000
如果他們知道我的真面目  他們會轉身就跑的
If they knew what I really was, they'd run the other way.

847
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:49,780
所以我學會了...
And so you learn to...

848
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:55,480
調和 偽裝
Blend in, to fake it.

849
01:19:58,090 --> 01:20:01,220
過不久..
After a while,

850
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:05,530
甚至不會注意到自己有多孤獨
you don't even notice how lonely you really are.

851
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:13,130
但是之後...
But then...

852
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:17,170
有人出現了
Someone comes along,

853
01:20:17,170 --> 01:20:18,640
像你這樣的人
someone like you.

854
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:25,980
即使他什麼都還不知道
Even if he just doesn't know it yet.

855
01:20:27,850 --> 01:20:29,890
突然間
And all of a sudden,

856
01:20:29,890 --> 01:20:33,760
你開始想..
you start thinking,

857
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,890
也許未必非要採取這種方式
maybe it doesn't have to be this way.

858
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:40,530
也許我未必非得孤獨
Maybe I don't have to be alone.

859
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:44,730
所以放開了手中的繩子
And so let go of the rope.

860
01:20:47,570 --> 01:20:50,540
因為這個人  他不會讓你跌倒
Because this person, he's not gonna let you fall.

861
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:53,040
他會抓住你 你知道會的
He's gonna catch you. You know it.

862
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:01,750
至少這就是你一直對自己說的
At least that's what you keep telling yourself.

863
01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:06,590
自始至終都是
The whole way down.

864
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:27,280
不要再回來
Don't come back.

865
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,010
如果我在你心中無足輕重
If that's all i am to you,

866
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:31,310
如果我只是一隻寵物
if I'm just a pet.

867
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:35,750
那麼不要再回來看我了
Then don't come back for me.

868
01:21:37,190 --> 01:21:39,650
不要再回來看我
Don't come back for me.

869
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:16,240
如果我為你這麼做
If I do this for you,

870
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:18,450
你就會相信我了嗎？
then you'll believe?

871
01:24:18,450 --> 01:24:19,950
是的
Yes.

872
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:35,760
這是不對的
This is wrong.

873
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:37,370
賽斯  你愛我
Seth, you love me.

874
01:24:37,370 --> 01:24:40,070
沒有比這兒更正確的
There is nothing more right than that.

875
01:24:55,450 --> 01:24:57,120
你就要成功了
You're almost there.

876
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:12,800
打開門
Open the door.

877
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,300
- 你在做什麼？- 快打開門
- What are you doing? - Open the fucking door.

878
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:16,810
你已經斷了一根指頭 賽斯
You're already down a finger, Seth.

879
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:18,270
你還準備再失去多少？
How much more are you ready to lose?

880
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:37,430
退後
Get back.

881
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:07,020
霍莉
Holly.

882
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:11,190
等等 你在做什麼？
Wait. What are you doing?

883
01:26:11,190 --> 01:26:13,360
噓
Shh.

884
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:24,540
我相信你
I believe you.

885
01:26:29,610 --> 01:26:31,650
是嗎？
You do?

886
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:37,190
你...
Do you...

887
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:44,460
你救了我  賽斯
You saved me, Seth.

888
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:48,960
當然我愛你
Of course i love you.

889
01:27:03,110 --> 01:27:05,280
但你知道那意味著什麼
But you know what that means.

890
01:27:15,390 --> 01:27:18,130
霍莉
Holly.

891
01:27:18,130 --> 01:27:21,130
不要離開我
Don't leave me.

892
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:39,610
哦 天啊
Oh, god.

893
01:28:02,510 --> 01:28:04,340
你為這些東西忙了多年
Eric: You've been working on these pieces for years.

894
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:06,510
我知道 我沒說我不興奮
Holly: I know, I'm not saying I'm not excited.

895
01:28:06,510 --> 01:28:08,580
能接到那個電話會開心死的
It's like great to get that call.

896
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:10,450
- 我只是 - 我以為你會更興奮的
- I just-- - I figured you'd be more psyched about this.

897
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:12,710
要出版了是件大事
It's a big deal, getting published.

898
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:15,580
這是一次自費出版 不是像《紐約客》那樣的
It's just a vanity press, it's not exactly "the new yorker."

899
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:18,090
除了這點  仍然感覺很棒
Screw that, it's still awesome.

900
01:28:18,090 --> 01:28:19,420
我為你感到驕傲
I'm proud of you.

901
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:21,460
我以為你不會喜歡我的小說
I thought you didn't even like my story.

902
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:23,060
我喜歡你
I like you.

903
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:29,230
- 嘿 寶貝 能把電話遞給我嗎？- 好的
- Hey, babe, can you grab my phone? - Yeah.

904
01:28:36,580 --> 01:28:38,700
嘿 種馬 整天都在想你 記得打電話給我 xoxo

905
01:29:10,110 --> 01:29:11,370
給
Here you go.

906
01:29:11,370 --> 01:29:12,640
謝謝 寶貝
Thank you, babe.

907
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:54,280
嗨
Hi.

908
01:29:57,820 --> 01:30:01,160
我今天和埃裏克又鬧得不太愉快
I had another bad day with Eric.

909
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:04,360
他仍在和其它女孩亂搞
He's still fooling around with other girls.

910
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:07,430
今天早上 我幾乎要傷他
This morning I almost hurt him.

911
01:30:10,370 --> 01:30:12,600
但我想起了你
But then I thought of you.

912
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:22,340
想起你有多愛我
And how much you love me.

913
01:30:24,850 --> 01:30:27,220
和你在為我做的事
And what you're doing for me.

914
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:32,250
然後我感覺好多了
Then I felt better.

915
01:30:36,870 --> 01:30:39,140
《寵物》
