00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,890
混沌初開之時
In the beginning...

19
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,490
世界只有一片汪洋
there was only ocean...

20
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,270
直到母親島
until the Mother Island emerged.

21
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,080
特菲提出現
Te Fiti.

22
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,540
特菲提之心擁有世上最強大的力量
Her heart held the greatest power ever known.

23
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,610
能夠創造生命
It could create life itself.

24
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,780
特菲提創造了世間一切生命
And Te Fiti shared it with the world.

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,870
可不久之后
But in time...

26
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,910
有些人開始尋找特菲提之心
some began to seek Te Fiti's heart.

27
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,160
他們堅信  得到它
They believed if they could possess it...

28
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,780
就能獲得創造一切的強大力量
the great power of creation would be theirs.

29
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,070
有一天
And one day...

30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,650
這些人中最大膽的一位
the most daring of them all...

31
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:41,180
跨越浩瀚的海洋去奪取特菲提之心
voyaged across the vast ocean to take it.

32
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,440
他是主宰風與海的半神
He was a demigod of the wind and sea.

33
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,500
他是一名勇士
He was a warrior.

34
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,040
一位魔術師
A trickster.

35
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,130
一個能用他神奇魚鉤的法力
A shapeshifter who could change form...

36
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,460
隨意變換形體的變形者
with the power of his magical fish hook.

37
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,210
他的名字叫作
And his name...

38
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,670
毛伊
was Maui.

39
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,400
但是失去了心之后  特菲提開始瓦解
But without her heart, Te Fiti began to crumble...

40
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,900
創造出了可怕的黑暗
giving birth to a terrible darkness.

41
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,030
毛伊試圖逃走
Maui tried to escape...

42
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,770
但碰上了另一個尋找特菲提之心的人
but was confronted by another who sought the heart.

43
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,630
特卡
Te Ka!

44
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,640
他是土與火的惡魔
A demon of earth and fire.

45
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,440
毛伊被從空中擊中
Maui was struck from the sky...

46
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,770
從此了無蹤跡
never to be seen again.

47
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,510
而他的魔法魚鉤和特菲提之心
And his magical fish hook and the heart of Te Fiti...

48
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,470
一起沉入了大海
were lost to the sea.

49
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,550
即使在一千年之后的今天
Where, even now 1,000 years later...

50
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,840
特卡和深海的惡魔
Te Ka and the demons of the deep

51
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,710
仍在尋找特菲提之心
still hunt for the heart.

52
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,030
他們隱藏在不斷蔓延的黑暗之中
Hiding in a darkness that will continue to spread...

53
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,300
趕跑我們的魚群
chasing away our fish...

54
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,960
侵占一座又一座島嶼
draining the life from island after island...

55
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,530
我們所有人都將
until every one of us is devoured...

56
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,280
被那嗜血的死亡魔爪
by the bloodthirsty jaws...

57
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,230
吞噬殆盡
of inescapable death!

58
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,990
但總有一天
But one day...

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,220
會有人找到特菲提之心
the heart will be found...

60
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,420
那個人將駛過環礁  揚帆遠航
by someone who will journey beyond our reef...

61
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,710
找到毛伊
find Maui...

62
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,210
帶他穿洋過海
deliver him across the great ocean...

63
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,580
歸還特菲提之心
to restore Te Fiti's heart...

64
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,660
拯救眾生
and save us all.

65
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,990
謝謝  母親  講到這兒就行了
Thank you, Mother. That's enough.

66
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,860
爸爸
Papa.

67
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,130
誰都不準越過環礁
No one goes outside the reef.

68
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,410
這里很安全  世上沒有黑暗勢力
We are safe here. There is no darkness.

69
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,280
也沒有什么怪獸
There are no monsters.

70
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,220
怪獸  怪獸
Monsters! Monsters!

71
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,590
-不不  沒有怪獸  -黑暗勢力來了
- There's no monsters, no monsters. - It's the darkness!

72
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,890
不  環礁外只有風暴和洶涌的大海
No, there is nothing beyond our reef, but storms and rough seas.

73
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,980
我要吐了
I'm gonna throw up.

74
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,780
只要我們大家都待在這座島上
As long as we stay on our very safe island...

75
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,820
就會很安全
we'll be fine.

76
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,290
傳說都是真的
The legends are true.

77
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,210
一定有人會揚帆遠航的
Someone will have to go.

78
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,120
母親  莫圖魯尼島就是天堂
Mother, Motunui is paradise.

79
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,490
誰還想去別的地方呢
Who would want to go anywhere else?

80
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,080
莫阿娜
Moana!

81
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,770
總算找到你了  莫阿娜
There you are, Moana.

82
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,400
你在做什么  嚇壞我了
What are you doing? You scared me.

83
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,920
干嘛  我想回去
What? I wanna's go back.

84
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,130
我知道  但你不能靠近海邊
I know, I know. But you don't go out there.

85
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,890
那里很危險
It's dangerous.

86
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,360
莫阿娜  走吧
Moana, come on.

87
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,710
我們回村子去
Let's go back to the village.

88
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,210
你是我們族人的下一任偉大的酋長
You are the next great chief of our people.

89
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,150
你會做許多了不起的事  我的小寶貝
And you will do wondrous things, my little minnow.

90
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,810
沒錯  但首先你要清楚自己的所屬之地
Oh, yes. But first, you must learn where you're meant to be.

爸爸
Dad!

139
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,370
我只是看看那些船  沒打算登船
I was only looking at the boats. I wasn't gonna get on 'em.

140
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,020
來吧  我給你看樣東西
Come on. There's something I need to show you.

141
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,680
從你出生起
I've wanted to bring you here

142
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,320
我就一直想帶你來這里

A place of chiefs.

總有一天
There will come a time...

146
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,730
你會站在這峰頂
when you will stand on this peak

147
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,900
給這座山添上一塊石頭
and place a stone on this mountain.

148
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,790
就像我  我的父親
Like I did. Like my father did.

149
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,420
他的父親  還有每一代酋長都這么做
And his father, and every chief that has ever been.

150
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,790
到那一天
And on that day...

151
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,350
等你把你的石頭放上去
when you add your stone...

152
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,710
你就會讓這座小島變得更高
you will raise this whole island higher.

153
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,990
你是我們族人的未來  莫阿娜
You are the future of our people, Moana.

154
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,940
他們并非遠在天邊
And they are not out there.

155
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,030
而是近在眼前
They are right here.

156
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,720
你是時候該成為他們需要的人了
It's time to be who they need you to be.

157
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,020
*纖維制成魚網*
*We make our nets from the fibers*

158
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,950
*椰汁清涼可口  樹葉生火*
*The water is sweet inside. We use the leaves to build fires*

159
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,870
*大伙一起歌唱*
*We sing these songs in our choirs*

160
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,060
*椰肉烹調  養活族人*
*To cook up the meat inside. We have mouths to feed inside*

161
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,070
*大家都信任我們  沒錯*
*The village believes in us. That's right*

162
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,980
*大家都信任*
*The village believes*

163
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,430
*小島給予我們所需*
*The island gives us what we need*

164
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,190
*無人離開*
*And no one leaves*

165
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,990
*所以我會留在這里*
*So here I'll stay*

166
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,000
*與我的家人族人一起*
*My home, my people beside me*

167
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,920
*當我展望未來之時*
*And when I think of tomorrow*

168
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,320
*我們相伴*
*There we are*

169
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,050
*我會帶領大家*
*I'll lead the way*

170
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,050
*也需要族人指引我*
*I'll have my people to guide me*

171
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,180
*我們會共筑未來*
*We'll build our future together*

172
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,400
*就在此地*
*Where we are*

173
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,290
*因為每條路都會帶你回到*
*'Cause every path leads ya back to*

174
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,320
*你的所屬之地*
*Where you are*

175
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,180
*你會發現幸福就在*
*You can find happiness right*

176
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,210
*你的所屬之地*
*Where you are*

177
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:58,080
*你的所屬之地*
*Where you are*

178
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,450
每次風暴過后
And every storm,

179
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,990
無論我鋪了多少樹葉  這屋頂還是漏水
this roof leaks, no matter how many fronds I add.

180
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,040
搞定  不是樹葉的問題
Fixed! Not the fronds.

181
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,040
是風把柱子吹偏了
Wind shifted the post.

182
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,050
這豬肉真好吃
That's good pork!

183
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,840
不是說你  我的意思是
I didn't mean... I wasn't...

184
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:22,850
什么  他們在叫我  那我先走了
What? They are calling me. So I gotta--. Bye!

185
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,070
你表現得很好
You're doing great.

186
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,540
好了嗎
Is it done yet?

187
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,320
就快了
So close.

188
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,750
我好奇為什么那只雞喜歡啄石頭
I'm curious about that chicken eating the rock.

189
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,040
它看起來好像
He seems to lack the basic intelligence

190
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,030
已經完全喪失理智了
required for pretty much everything.

191
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:58,090
我們能把它給煮了嗎
Should we maybe just cook him?

192
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,390
有時我們的優點隱藏在外表之下
Sometimes our strengths lie beneath the surface.

193
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,530
某些時候還藏得很深
Far beneath in some cases.

194
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:10,090
但憨憨一定有我們看不到的過人之處
But I'm sure there's more to Heihei than meets the eye.

195
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,270
這是今天摘的
It's the harvest.

196
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,430
今早  我在剝椰子時發現...
This morning, I was husking the coconuts and...

197
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,600
我們應該砍掉這些病樹
We should clear the diseased trees

198
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,380
然后重新種一片椰子林
and we will start a new grove.

199
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,470
就在那
There.

200
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,260
謝謝  莫阿娜
Thanks, Moana.

201
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,180
她做得真棒
She's doing great.

202
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,800
這活很適合你
This suits you.

203
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,650
酋長
Chief?

204
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,830
有些東西你得瞧瞧
There's something you need to see.

205
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,960
這是我們在東礁湖設的捕魚簍
Our traps in the east lagoon...

206
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,340
捕到的魚越來越少了
they're pulling up less and less fish.

207
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,300
那我們就換個地方捕魚
Then we'll rotate the fishing grounds.

208
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,450
我們試過了  還是沒有魚
We have. There's no fish.

209
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,850
那我們就去島的另一面捕魚
Then we'll fish the far side of the island.

210
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,910
也試過了
We tried.

211
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,380
迎風的那邊呢
The windward side.

212
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,160
還有背風的那邊  淺灘  海峽
And the leeward side, the shallows, the channel.

213
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,100
整個礁湖我們都試過了
We've tried the whole lagoon.

214
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,370
到處都沒有魚
They're just gone.

215
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,720
你試過用另一種魚餌嗎
Have you tried using a different bait?

216
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,410
我覺得不是魚餌的問題  完全沒有魚
I don't think it's the bait. There's no fish.

217
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,530
而且情況越來越糟
It seems like it's getting worse and worse.

218
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,300
當然  我理解你的擔心不無道理
Of course, I understand you have reason for concern.

219
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,120
我會和長老們商量  我確信...
I will talk to the council. I'm sure we...

220
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,970
如果我們去環礁之外捕魚呢
What if we fish beyond the reef?

221
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,610
誰都不準越過環礁
No one goes beyond the reef.

222
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,300
我明白  但如果礁湖里面沒有魚群
I know. But if there are no fish in the lagoon...

223
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,040
-莫阿娜  -而海洋那么大
- Moana. - And there's a whole ocean.

224
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,550
我們要遵守規矩
We have one rule.

225
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,280
那是有魚可捕時的舊規矩
An old rule, when there were fish.

226
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,280
-遵守規矩我們才安全  -可是  爸爸
- A rule that keeps us safe... - But Dad...

227
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,930
不準你為了能再次靠近大海
Instead of endangering our people

228
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,110
而使我們的族人身陷危險
so you can run right back to the water.

229
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,090
我還以為你早放棄了那個念頭...
Every time I think you're past this...

230
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,750
誰都不能越過環礁
No one goes beyond the reef!

231
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,930
你不該當著你爸的面說出來
Well, it's not like you said it in front of your dad.

232
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,540
還站在船上
Standing on a boat.

233
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,290
我又沒說"到環礁之外捕魚
I didn't say go beyond the reef,

234
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,510
因為我想在海上航行"
because I want to be on the ocean.

235
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,350
但你確實想去
But you still do.

236
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,400
-他對你嚴厲是因為  -因為他不懂我
- He's hard on you because... - Because he doesn't get me.

237
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,020
因為他曾經和你一樣
Because he was you.

238
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,820
被大海所吸引
Drawn to the ocean.

239
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,400
漫步在沙灘
Down by the shore.

240
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,260
他曾駕駛獨木舟  莫阿娜
He took a canoe, Moana.

241
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,140
他穿越環礁
He crossed the reef...

242
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,410
駛入了一片危險的海域
and found an unforgiving sea.

243
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,690
海浪如山一樣高
Waves like mountains.

244
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,340
他最好的朋友懇求他  出海時帶上他
His best friend begged to be on that boat.

245
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,770
你爸爸卻沒能救回他
Your dad couldn't save him.

246
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,180
他希望自己能夠救你
He's hoping he can save you.

247
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,710
有時候
Sometimes...

248
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:59,640
我們想要成為誰  想做什么事
who we wish we were, what we wish we could do...

249
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,220
并不一定能夠如愿
it's just not meant to be.

250
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,630
*從很久前我就喜歡眺望*
*I've been staring at the edge of the water*

251
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,740
*海平面的盡頭*
*Long as I can remember*

252
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,270
*卻從不明白原因*
*Never really knowing why*

253
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,700
*我希望能做個聽話的女兒*
*I wish I could be the perfect daughter*

254
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,730
*但無論我如何努力*
*But I come back to the water*

255
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,760
*都還是回到這海洋*
*No matter how hard I try*

256
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,030
*經過每個轉彎  走過每條小徑*
*Every turn I take, every trail I track*

257
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,200
*踏過每條小路  都引領我回到*
*Every path I make, every road leads back*

258
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,930
*那個我不能去*
*To the place I know where I cannot go*

259
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,800
*卻無比向往的地方*
*Where I long to be*

260
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,270
*看那海天相接*
*See the line where the sky meets the sea*

261
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,910
*它呼喚著我*
*It calls me*

262
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,790
*有誰知道*
*And no one knows*

263
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:04,310
*它延伸到多遠*
*How far it goes*

264
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:09,220
*如果海風助我  揚帆起航*
*If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me*

265
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,720
*我終會知道*
*One day I'll know*

266
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:16,570
*若我啟程  前途無限*
*If I go, there's just no telling how far I'll go*

267
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:20,050
*我知道這座島上的每個人*
*I know everybody on this island*

268
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:23,060
*似乎對島上生活快樂無憂*
*Seems so happy on this island*

269
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,650
*一切早已安排好*
*Everything is by design*

270
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:31,260
*我知道這座島上的每個人*
*I know everybody on this island*

271
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,380
*都有自己的在島上的職責*
*Has a role on this island*

272
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,200
*所以或許我也該坦然接受*
*So maybe I can roll with mine*

273
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,420
*我可以驕傲地領導  讓部族更強*
*I can lead with pride I can make us strong*

274
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,240
*若我遵循傳統  應該也會心滿意足*
*I'll be satisfied if I play along*

275
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,310
*但心里卻一直唱著另一首歌*
*But the voice inside sings a different song*

276
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,130
*我這是怎么了*
*What is wrong with me*

277
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,180
*看遠方海上陽光閃耀*
*See the light as it shines on the sea*

278
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,030
*令人目眩*
*It's blinding*

279
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,830
*有誰知道*
*But no one knows*

280
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,290
*它能照到多深*
*How deep it goes*

281
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,430
*似乎在呼喚我*
*And it seems like it's calling out to me*

282
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,360
*來找我吧*
*So come find me*

283
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,690
*我想知道*
*And let me know*

284
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,870
*海平線外面的世界  我能否穿過海平線*
*What's beyond that line will I cross that line*

285
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,210
*看那海天相接*
*The line where the sky meets the sea*

286
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,910
*它呼喚著我*
*It calls me*

287
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,740
*有誰知道*
*And no one knows*

288
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,070
*它延伸到多遠*
*How far it goes*

289
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:32,180
*如果海風助我  揚帆起航*
*If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me*

290
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,980
*我終會知道*
*One day I'll know*

291
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:41,840
*我將遠行何方*
*How far I'll go*

292
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,110
沒事  胖胖
We're okay, Pua.

293
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,760
我能搞定
I can do this.

294
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,290
環礁外肯定有更多魚
There's more fish beyond the reef.

295
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,000
肯定有的
There's more beyond the reef.

296
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,650
不算糟嘛
Not so bad.

297
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,090
胖胖
Pua!

298
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,840
不管剛剛發生了什么
Whatever just happened...

299
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,920
就說是這頭豬干的
blame it on the pig.

300
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,990
奶奶
Gramma.

301
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,500
你會告訴爸嗎
Are you gonna tell dad?

302
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,330
我是他媽  不用向他匯報
I'm his mom. I don't have to tell him anything.

303
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,860
他說得沒錯
He was right.

304
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,510
外面很危險
About going out there.

305
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,010
是時候把我的石頭放在山上了
It's time to put my stone on the mountain.

306
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,370
好啊  你回去吧
Okay. Well, then, head on back.

307
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,160
把石頭放上去吧
Put that stone up there.

308
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,690
你怎么不勸我
Why aren't you trying to talk me out of it?

309
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,050
你不是說那就是你想要的嗎
You said that's what you wanted.

310
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,410
沒錯
It is.

311
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,020
我死之后...
When I die...

312
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:08,040
我要作為它們中的一員回歸
I'm going to come back as one of these.

313
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,080
否則我這紋身就白紋了
Or I chose the wrong tattoo.

314
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,160
你怎么怪怪的
Why are you acting weird?

315
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,090
我是村里的怪奶奶呀  這就是我的工作
I'm the village crazy lady. That's my job.

316
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,400
如果你有什么想告訴我的  盡管直說
If there's something you want to tell me, just tell me!

317
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,250
你有什么想告訴我的嗎
Is there something you wanna tell me?

318
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,190
你有什么想聽的嗎
Is there something you want to hear?

319
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,920
我們族人所有的故事你都聽過了
You've been told all our people's stories...

320
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,420
這個除外
but one.

321
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,160
這是什么地方
What is this place?

322
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:45,170
你真以為我們的祖先一直待在環礁以內嗎
Do you really think our ancestors stayed within the reef?

323
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,120
里面是什么
What's in there?

324
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:03,140
是你一直以來想不通的問題的答案
The answer to the question you keep asking yourself.

325
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,320
你注定會成為誰
Who are you meant to be?

326
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,730
進去吧...
Go inside...

327
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,600
敲敲鼓...
bang the drum...

328
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,140
你就會知道
and find out.

329
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,290
對了  敲鼓
Bang the drum.

330
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,850
*我們辨風向  讀天相*
*We read the wind and the sky*

331
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,630
*日懸中天時*
*When the sun is high*

332
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:04,830
*乘風破浪走*
*We sail the length of the seas*

333
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,570
*穿洋過海行*
*On the ocean breeze*

334
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,710
*夜里指認每顆星星*
*At night we name every star*

335
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,950
*知道自己在何方*
*We know where we are*

336
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:16,710
*知道自己是誰  自己是誰*
*We know who we are who we are*

337
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,220
*我們啟航漫游*
*We set a course to find*

338
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:26,460
*尋找新的家園*
*A brand new island everywhere we roam*

339
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:31,120
*故土永在心中*
*We keep our island in our mind*

340
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,360
*故土永在心中  念時即能歸鄉*
*And when it's time to find home we know the way*

341
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,780
*我們是解讀一切的探險家*
*We are explorers reading every sign*

342
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:46,600
*我們的故事世代相傳  永不終結*
*We tell the stories of our elders in a never-ending chain*

343
00:25:53,130 --> 00:26:00,220
*我們認得回家的路*
*We know the way*

344
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,660
我們曾是航海者
We were voyagers.

345
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,190
我們曾是航海者
We were voyagers!

346
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,990
我們曾是航海者  我們曾是航海者
We were voyagers! We were voyagers!

347
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,450
我們曾是航海者
We were voyagers!

348
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,720
為什么不航海了
Why'd we stop?

349
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,240
是毛伊
Maui.

350
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:20,070
自從他從母親島偷走了特菲提之心
When he stole from the Mother Island,

351
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,770
黑暗降臨
darkness fell.

352
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,910
特卡蘇醒了
Te Ka awoke.

353
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:27,880
四處怪物潛伏  吞沒船只
Monsters lurked and boats stopped coming back.

354
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:31,840
為了保護族人  歷代酋長都禁止出航
To protect our people, the ancient chiefs forbid voyaging...

355
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,790
現在我們已經忘了自己是航海者的后代了
and now we have forgotten who we are.

356
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:40,130
黑暗還在繼續蔓延...
And the darkness has continued to spread...

357
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,610
趕跑我們的魚群...
chasing away our fish...

358
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:48,370
吸干一座又一座島嶼上的生命
draining the life...from island after island.

359
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,080
我們的小島
Our island.

360
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,680
但是  總有一天...
But, one day...

361
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:00,000
有人會越過我們的環礁  找到毛伊
someone will journey beyond our reef, find Maui...

362
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,550
帶他穿洋過海
deliver him across the great ocean...

363
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:08,360
歸還特菲提之心
to restore the heart of Te Fiti.

364
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,300
那天的事我看到了
I was there that day.

365
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,320
大海選擇了你
The ocean chose you.

366
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,780
我還以為那是個夢
I thought it was a dream.

367
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,690
不
Nope!

368
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,760
我們的祖先相信毛伊就在那里...
Our ancestors believed Maui lies there...

369
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,700
在他的魚鉤下面
at the bottom of his hook.

370
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,820
跟著魚鉤狀星座  你就會找到他
Follow it, and you will find him.

371
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:47,260
可為什么它選擇的是我
But why would it choose me?

372
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,700
我甚至不知道怎么駕船駛過環礁
I don't even know how to make it past the reef.

373
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,370
不過我知道誰能
But I know who does!

374
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,530
-莊稼變黑了  -魚呢
- The crops are turning black. - What about the fish?

375
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,040
整個島都這樣
This is happening all over the island.

376
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,700
-各位  請先冷靜  -你要怎么做
- Please, please settle down. - What are you going to do?

377
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,640
我們開墾新土地  總會找到辦法...
We will dig new fields. We will find a way to...

378
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,870
我們可以阻止黑暗  拯救我們的小島
We can stop the darkness! Save our island!

379
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,470
我發現一個停滿了船的洞穴
There's a cavern of boats.

380
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,090
巨大的獨木舟
Huge canoes.

381
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,110
我們可以乘這些船  找到毛伊
We can take them, find Maui,

382
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,850
讓他歸還特菲提之心
make him restore the heart.

383
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,280
我們曾是航海者  我們可以再次出海
We were voyagers. We can voyage again!

384
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,420
是你告訴我要幫助族人
You told me to help our people.

385
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,720
只有這樣才能幫助他們
This is how we help our people.

386
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,140
爸爸
Dad?

387
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,310
你要干嗎
What are you doing?

388
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,890
我早就該一把火燒了那些船
I should've burned those boats a long time ago!

389
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:37,010
不  不要
No! Don't!

390
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,470
我們必須找到毛伊
We have to find Maui.

391
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,700
我們必須歸還特菲提之心
We have to restore the heart!

392
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,270
沒有什么心
There is no heart!

393
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,580
這就是塊破石頭
This is just a rock!

394
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,560
不要
No!

395
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,120
酋長  您母親出事了
Chief! It's your mother!

396
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,130
母親...
Mother...

397
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,860
我們可以做什么
What can be done?

398
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,410
快去
Go-

399
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,850
奶奶
Gramma.

400
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,060
快去
Go-

401
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,140
現在不行
Not now. I can't.

402
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,740
你必須去
You must!

403
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:50,010
大海選擇了你
The ocean chose you.

404
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,420
跟著魚鉤狀星座走
Follow the fish hook.

405
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,410
奶奶...
Gramma...

406
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:55,070
等你找到了毛伊...
And when you find Maui...

407
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:59,370
你就揪著他的耳朵說...
you grab him by the ear. You say...

408
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,740
"我是莫圖魯尼島的莫阿娜
"I am Moana of Motunui.

409
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,370
"你必須跟我上船
"You will board my boat...

410
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,650
"穿過大海
"Sail across the sea...

411
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,650
"歸還特菲提之心"
"And restore the heart of Te Fiti."

412
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,310
我不要離開你
I can't leave you.

413
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:21,740
無論你去哪里  我都陪在你身邊
There is nowhere you could go that I won't be with you.

414
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,860
快去
Go!

415
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,850
*看那海天相接*
*There's a line where the sky meets the sea*

416
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:53,070
*它呼喚著我*
*And it calls me*

417
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,930
*有誰知道*
*But no one knows*

418
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:59,400
*它延伸到多遠*
*How far it goes*

419
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:04,710
*所屬之地  困惑不再*
*All that time wondering where I need to be is behind me*

420
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:07,690
*全靠我自己*
*I'm on my own*

421
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:11,170
*去向未知天地*
*To worlds unknown*

422
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:14,050
*經過每個轉彎  走過每條小徑*
*Every turn I take every trail I track*

423
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,330
*都是我的選擇*
*Is a choice I make*

424
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,430
*現在我無法回頭  直面浩渺未知*
*Now I can't turn back from the great unknown*

425
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:23,370
*獨自前往  心之所向*
*Where I go alone where I long to be*

426
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,370
*看她照亮夜之海*
*See her light up the night in the sea*

427
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:37,200
*她在呼喚我*
*She calls me*

428
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,960
*是的  我知道*
*And yes, I know*

429
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:43,340
*我可以揚帆遠航*
*That I can go*

430
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:48,650
*明月懸空  我迎著海風*
*There's a moon in the sky and the wind is behind me*

431
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:51,280
*很快就會知道*
*Soon I'll know*

432
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:58,470
*我將遠行何方*
*How far I'll go*

433
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:16,870
我是莫圖魯尼島的莫阿娜
I am Moana of Motunui.

434
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,280
你必須跟我上船
You will board my boat...

435
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,160
穿過大海  歸還特菲提之心
sail across the sea and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

436
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,990
我是莫圖魯尼島的...
I am Moana...

437
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,010
莫阿...

438
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,330
...娜

439
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,390
憨憨
Heihei?

440
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,790
別怕  沒事的
It's okay. You're all right.

441
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,210
你看
See?

442
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,830
是吧  多友好的海水
There we go. Nice water.

443
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,580
大海是我的朋友
The ocean is a friend of mine.

444
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,470
憨憨
Heihei?

445
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:20,860
憨憨
Heihei!

446
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,000
別動
Stay.

447
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:46,490
好了  下一站  毛伊
Okay. Next stop, Maui.

448
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:57,070
我是莫圖魯尼島的莫阿娜
I am Moana of Motunui.

449
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,860
你必須跟我上船...
You will board my boat...

450
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:03,940
穿...過大海...
sail... across the sea...

451
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:06,520
歸還特菲提之心
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

452
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:11,210
我是莫圖魯尼島的莫...
I am Moana of Motu...

453
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,680
跟我上船
Board my boat!

454
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,500
不
Oh, no...

455
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,310
不不不
No, no, no!

456
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,140
大海...
Ocean...

457
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:42,490
能不能幫幫我
can I get a little help?

458
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,890
不不
No, no.

459
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,860
拜托  快點
Please. Come on!

460
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:04,860
幫幫我  求你了
Help me! Please!

461
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,080
怎么回事
What?

462
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,280
我說幫幫我
I said help me!

463
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,800
你卻毀了我的船
And wrecking my boat?

464
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,710
幫倒忙
Not helping!

465
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:02,080
活該魚群天天在你里面尿尿
Fish pee in you all day!

466
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,200
那
So...

467
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,750
毛伊
Maui?

468
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,750
毛伊
Maui!

469
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,790
毛伊  主宰風與海的半神...
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea...

470
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,830
我是莫圖魯尼島的莫阿娜
I am Moana of Motunui.

471
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,350
你跟我上船
You will board my boat.

472
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:38,610
不  你必須跟我上船
No. You will board my boat.

473
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,520
對  我是莫圖魯尼島的莫阿娜
Yeah. I am Moana of Motunui.

474
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,290
你必須...
You will board my...

475
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,570
船  一艘船
Boat! A boat!

476
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:49,520
諸神賜給我一艘...
The gods have given me a...

477
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,630
毛伊  變形者...
Maui, shapeshifter...

478
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,770
主宰風與海的半神...
demigod of the wind and sea...

479
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:10,370
-我是莫圖魯尼島的  -人類的英雄
- I am Moana of... - Hero of men.

480
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:10,950
什么
What?

481
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,460
全稱是  毛伊  變形者
It's actually, Maui, shapeshifter,

482
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:15,350
主宰風與海的半神  人類的英雄
demigod of the wind and sea...hero of men.

483
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,200
我打斷你了  你從頭再來
I interrupted. From the top.

484
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,760
加上人類的英雄  說吧
Hero of men. Go.

485
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,380
我是...
I am...

486
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,930
抱歉  抱歉  抱歉
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

487
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:25,230
還有女人  是男人和女人的英雄
And women. Men and women.

488
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:28,130
對兩種性別都是  對所有人都是  不論男女
Both. All. Not a guy, girl thing.

489
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:30,180
畢竟毛伊是所有人的英雄
You know, Maui is a hero to all.

490
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,320
你說得不錯
You're doing great.

491
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,350
什么  不  我來這是...
What? No! I'm here to...

492
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,680
當然  當然
Of course. Of course.

493
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,010
對對對
Yes, yes, yes.

494
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,930
毛伊對粉絲永遠有耐心
Maui always has time for his fans.

495
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,230
如果你用一只鳥來寫字...
When you use a bird to write with...

496
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,570
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}tweet既可指發推特也可指鳥吱吱叫

497
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,570
就叫發推
it's called tweeting.

498
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:51,350
我知道  英雄不是隨隨便便就能見到的
I know, not every day you get a chance to meet your hero.

499
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:54,150
你不是我的英雄
You are not my hero.

500
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,900
我來這不是讓你在我槳上簽名的
And I'm not here so you can sign my oar!

501
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,420
我來這是因為你偷了特菲提之心
I'm here 'cause you stole the heart of Te Fiti!

502
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,790
你必須跟我上船
And you will board my boat...

503
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:05,290
穿過大海  把它還回去
and sail across the sea and put it back!

504
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,440
聽起簡直就像你不喜歡我...
Yeah, it almost sounded like you don't like me...

505
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,790
不過這不可能...
which is impossible because...

506
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,170
我被困在這里一千年
I got stuck here for 1,000 years...

507
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:15,680
就是為了把這顆心當禮物送給你們凡人
trying to get the heart as a gift for you mortals.

508
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,400
你們就能擁有創造生命的力量
So you could have the power to create life itself.

509
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,430
所以我相信你想說的應該是
Yeah. So, what I believe you were trying to say...

510
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,000
"謝謝"
is "Thank you."

511
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,560
-"謝謝"  -不客氣
- "Thank you?" - You're welcome.

512
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,610
什么  不不不
What? No, no, no!

513
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,350
我不是  不是
I didn't... I wasn't...

514
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,230
為什么我要說謝謝
Why would I ever say that? I mean.

515
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,750
好啦好啦
Okay, okay.

516
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,770
*我知道是什么情況了*
*I see what's happening yeah*

517
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:37,300
*你面對我這種偉大  感覺很怪*
*You're face to face with greatness and it's strange*

518
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,790
*你不明白自己什么感受*
*You don't even know how you feel*

519
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,130
*真是傻得可愛*
*It's adorable*

520
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:44,470
*人類沒什么變化真是太好了*
*Well it's nice to see that humans never change*

521
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:48,010
*睜大你的眼睛  開始吧*
*Open your eyes let's begin*

522
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,130
*沒錯就是我*
*Yes, it's really me*

523
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,880
*保持冷靜  正是我毛伊*
*It's Maui breathe it in*

524
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,970
*我知道這是重大驚喜*
*I know it's a lot*

525
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:55,310
*我的秀發  健體*
*The hair the bod*

526
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:58,210
*當你正看著一位半神*
*When you're staring at a demigod*

527
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:01,000
*我只能說*
*What can I say except*

528
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,510
*別客氣*
*You're welcome*

529
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:05,750
*不需為了潮汐  太陽和天空感謝我*
*For the tides, the sun, the sky*

530
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:09,590
*小事一樁  別客氣*
*Hey, it's okay, it's okay you're welcome*

531
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,840
*我只是個平凡的半神*
*I'm just an ordinary demiguy*

532
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,240
*是誰用雙手撐起天空*
*What has two thumbs and pulled up the sky*

533
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,130
*當你還蹣跚學步*
*When you were waddling yay high?*

534
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,390
*正是在下*
*This guy*

535
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:24,260
*當夜晚寒冷  誰為你偷來火焰*
*When the nights got cold who stole you fire from down below?*

536
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,690
*正是你看著的在下*
*You're looking at him*

537
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,570
*我還套住了太陽*
*Also I lassoed the sun*

538
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,400
*別客氣*
*You're welcome*

539
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,970
*只是為了延長白天  給你們帶來歡樂*
*To stretch your days and bring you fun*

540
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:37,650
*我還利用海風*
*Also I harnessed the breeze*

541
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:38,560
*別客氣*
You're welcome

542
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,160
*推動帆船  搖晃樹木*
*To fill your sails and shake your trees*

543
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:45,190
*除了別客氣我還能說什么*
*So what can I say except you're welcome*

544
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:48,270
*不需因為我升起島嶼而謝我*
*For the islands I pulled from the sea*

545
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:50,710
*不需向我頂禮膜拜*
*There's no need to pray it's okay*

546
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,270
*別客氣*
*You're welcome*

547
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,520
*我就是這么一個助人為樂的好心人*
*I guess it's just my way of being me*

548
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,660
*別客氣*
*You're welcome*

549
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,460
*別客氣*
*You're welcome*

550
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,860
*其實想一想*
*Well come to think of it*

551
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,340
*孩子  我能滔滔不絕地說下去*
*Kid, honestly I could go on and on*

552
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,660
*我可以解釋所有的自然現象*
*I could explain every natural phenomenon*

553
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,130
*潮汐  草地  土地*
*The tide, the grass the ground*

554
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,910
*只是毛伊隨手做的小貢獻*
*That was Maui just messing around*

555
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,660
*我殺了條鰻魚  埋下它的內臟*
*I killed an eel I buried its guts*

556
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,420

*Sprouted a tree now you got coconuts*

557
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,240
*什么是教訓  什么是代價*
*What's the lesson? What is the take away?*

558
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,210
*毛伊一出手  千萬別惹他*
*Don't mess with Maui when he's on a breakaway*

559
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:17,900
*我身上的紋身*

560
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,630
*就是我勝利的地圖*

*Look where I've been I make everything happen*

562
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,960
*看這只小小毛伊踢踏起舞*
*Look at that Mean Mini-Maui just tickety tappin'*

563
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,740
*讓我說  別客氣*
*Well anyway let me say you're welcome*

564
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,380
*別客氣*
*You're welcome*

565
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,550
*不需為了花花世界謝我*
*For the wonderful world you know*

566
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,860
*小事一樁  別客氣*
*Hey, it's okay, it's okay you're welcome*

567
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,810
*別客氣*
*You're welcome*

568
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:41,690
*轉念一想  我得走了*
*Well come to think of it I gotta go*

569
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,010
*今天輪到你說別客氣*
*Hey it's your day to say you're welcome*

570
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,060
*別客氣*
*You're welcome*

571
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,740
*因為我得用你的那條船*
*'Cause I'm gonna need that boat*

572
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,090
*我要啟航  別客氣*
*I'm sailing away away you're welcome*

573
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:52,900
*別客氣*
*You're welcome*

574
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,670
*毛伊除了水上漂  什么都能做到*
*'Cause Maui can do everything but float*

575
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,450
*別客氣  別客氣*
*You're welcome you're welcome*

576
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,610
*別客氣  別客氣*
*You're welcome you're welcome*

577
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,410
謝謝你
And thank you!

578
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:08,640
讓我出去  你這個滿嘴謊言的大騙...
Let me out! You lying, slimy son of a...

579
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,930
別客氣
You're welcome.

580
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,180
真的別客氣
You're so welcome.

581
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,990
不  我才不會和一個孩子去特菲提
No. I'm not going to Te Fiti with some kid.

582
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,970
我要去拿我的魚鉤
I'm going to get my hook.

583
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:26,410
你的魚鉤還在  我沒有魚鉤就不是毛伊了
You have yours and I'm not Maui without mine.

584
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,810
好了  去后面吧
Okay, talk to the back.

585
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,260
船上零食
Boat snack.

586
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,670
再見了  這一堆臭石頭
Good riddance, you filthy pile of pebbles.

587
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:08,830
不不不  別這樣看著我
Oh, no, no, no. Don't look at me like that.

588
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:11,330
那是個漂亮的山洞  她會喜歡的
It's a beautiful cave. She's gonna love it.

589
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:15,580
我會在我的肚子里好好疼愛你的
And I'm going to love you in ma belly.

590
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:17,720
現在先把你養肥一點吧  小雞腿
Now, let's fatten you up, drumstick.

591
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,170
剛才那一幕我能循環看一天
I could watch that all day.

592
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,300
好了  好好享受這座島吧
Okay. Enjoy the island.

593
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:46,650
毛伊走也
Maui, out.

594
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,240
不  停下
No! Stop!

595
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:51,220
你得把心石放回去
You have to put back the heart!

596
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:08,840
還真是出乎意料
Did not see that coming.

597
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:13,820
我是莫圖魯尼島的莫阿娜
I am Moana of Motunui.

598
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,350
這是我的獨木舟
This is my canoe...

599
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,200
你將和我一起
and you will journey to...

600
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:22,270
好  忘了她吧  我們得走了
All right, get over it. We gotta move.

601
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,380
然后她又回來了
And she's back.

602
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:28,360
我是莫圖魯尼島的莫阿娜
I am Moana of Motunui...

603
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,830
你叫莫阿娜  對吧
It was Moana, right?

604
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:35,710
是的
Yes.

605
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,430
你得去歸還心石
And you will restore the heart!

606
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,680
好吧  我退出
All right. I'm out.

607
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:57,170
拜托
Oh, come on!

608
00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:59,950
你怎么了
What is your problem?

609
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:03,390
你很害怕它嗎
Are you afraid of it?

610
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,130
不  不
No! No.

611
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:06,760
我不害怕
I'm not afraid.

612
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:12,580
別摻和  不然我就讓你睡在我的腋窩里
Stay out of it or you're sleeping in my armpit.

613
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:13,490
你別鬧了
You, stop it.

614
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:16,280
這不是一顆心  這是詛咒
That is not a heart. It is a curse.

615
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,860
我一拿到它  就被炸飛到九霄云外
The second I took it, I got blasted outta the sky...

616
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,990
還丟了我的魚鉤
and I lost my hook.

617
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,820
把它拿走
Get it away from me.

618
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,810
把這個拿走嗎
Get this away?

619
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,500
我可是個半神好嗎
I'm a demigod, okay?

620
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,320
停下  我會懲罰你的
Stop that. I will smite you!

621
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,160
你想被乘法嗎
You wanna get smote?

622
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,120
還是承乏
Smotten?

623
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:33,870
聽著  這東西才不會給你創造生命的力量
Listen, that thing doesn't give you power to create life...

624
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,860
它會招致死亡
it's a homing beacon of death.

625
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:38,420
如果你不扔掉它  壞事會找上門的
If you don't put it away, bad things are gonna come for it.

626
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,790
因為這個嗎  心石
Come for this? The heart?

627
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,350
{\an8}你是指這里的這塊心石嗎
You mean this heart right here?

628
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:42,630
別  你不要這樣大聲說話
Don't, you can't raise your voice like that!

629
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:44,160
快來拿吧
Come and get it!

630
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,870
你會害死我們的
You are gonna get us killed!

631
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:49,460
不  我會讓我們安全到達特菲提讓你歸還心石
No, I'm gonna get us to Te Fiti, so you can put it back.

632
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:50,310
謝謝你
Thank you.

633
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:51,840
別客氣
You're welcome.

634
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:58,000
卡卡莫拉
Kakamora.

635
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,190
卡卡什么
Kaka-what?

636
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:01,090
兇殘的小海盜
Murdering little pirates.

637
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,370
真想不通他們為什么而來
Wonder what they're here for.

638
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:11,690
他們有點可愛啊
They're kinda cute.

639
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:30,020
大海
Ocean!

640
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:32,140
快幫幫我們
Do something! Help us!

641
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,400
海洋不會幫你  你得自救
The ocean doesn't help you, you help yourself!

642
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,570
拉緊吊索  捆好側支索
Tighten the halyard. Bind the stays!

643
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,330
你不會駕船
You can't sail?

644
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,370
我
I...

645
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:42,690
我是自學成才的
I am self-taught.

646
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:56,180
你不是能變形什么的嗎
Can't you shapeshift or something?

647
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:57,300
你看見我的魚鉤了嗎
Do you see my hook?

648
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,620
沒有魔法魚鉤  我就沒有魔法
No magic hook, no magic powers!

649
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:27,280
他們一條船分成了好幾條
Their boat is turning into more boats!

650
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,940
沒錯  我做到了
Yep, I just did that.

651
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,090
不不
No, no!

652
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:57,960
憨憨
Heihei!

653
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,000
毛伊
Maui!

654
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,680
他們拿走了心石
They took the heart!

655
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:17,780
那是只雞
That's a chicken.

656
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:19,220
心石就在那只雞的
The heart is in the...

657
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:21,920
我們得把雞救回來
We have to get him back!

658
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,670
毛伊
Maui!

659
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,100
那兒  就在那兒
There! Right there!

660
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,520
你要掉頭
You're turning?

661
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:46,690
你在做什么
What are you doing?

662
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,150
逃跑啊
Escaping!

663
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:49,340
心石[心形]
The heart!

664
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,290
算了吧  你拿不回來的
Forget it! You'll never get it back!

665
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,270
再說了 你有一顆更好的
Besides, you got a better one.

666
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:56,200
我要用什么控制船
What am I gonna steer with?

667
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,630
他們會殺了你的
They're just gonna kill ya!

668
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,860
小椰子
Coconuts.

669
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,510
拿到了
Got it!

670
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,950
我們做到了
We did it!

671
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:15,340
恭喜你沒死  小姑娘
Congratulations on not being dead, girlie.

672
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:16,500
你真讓我吃驚
You surprise me.

673
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:19,520
但我還是不會把那玩意還回去的
But I'm still not taking that thing back.

674
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,470
你要去特菲提
You wanna get to Te Fiti

675
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:23,950
得穿過整個兇險的海洋
you gotta go through a whole ocean of bad.

676
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:25,610
更別說特卡的阻擋了
Not to mention Te Ka.

677
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:28,100
巖漿怪
Lava monster?

678
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:30,420
你打敗過巖漿怪嗎
Ever defeat a lava monster?

679
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:33,440
沒有  你呢
No. Have you?

680
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:44,230
我才不會和一個凡人去送死
I'm not going on a suicide mission with some mortal.

681
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,130
你沒我可歸還不了心石
You can't restore the heart without me...

682
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:49,010
而我是拒絕的
and me says no.

683
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:51,240
我要去拿回魚鉤
I'm getting my hook.

684
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:53,940
討論到此為止
End of discussion.

685
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:02,670
你會成為一位英雄的
You'd be a hero.

686
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,990
那是你人生的意義  不是嗎
That's what you're all about, right?

687
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:10,100
小姑娘  我已經是英雄了
Little girl, I am a hero.

688
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,590
也許你曾經是
Maybe you were.

689
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,770
但現在
But now...

690
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:15,870
現在你只是偷了特菲提之心的那個家伙
now you're just the guy who stole the heart of Te Fiti.

691
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:17,990
那個毀了世界的家伙
The guy who cursed the world.

692
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:21,530
沒人覺得你是英雄
You're no one's hero.

693
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:22,880
沒人
No one?

694
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:33,450
但是呢
But...

695
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:35,370
把這個還回去
put this back...

696
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:37,440
拯救世界
save the world...

697
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:39,840
你就會成為所有人的英雄
you'd be everyone's hero.

698
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:47,560
毛伊  毛伊  毛伊
Maui! Maui! Maui!

699
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:49,940
你真了不起
You're so amazing!

700
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,070
沒有我的魚鉤做不到  過不了特卡那關
We'd never make it without my hook. Not past Te Ka.

701
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:54,380
那我們就去拿你的魚鉤
Then we get your hook.

702
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:57,720
拿回你的魚鉤  打倒特卡  歸還心石
We get your hook, take out Te Ka, restore the heart.

703
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:00,690
除非你不想成為
Unless you don't wanna be...

704
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:04,340
毛伊  主宰風與海的半神
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea.

705
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,000
全民
Hero to...

706
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:07,360
英雄
all.

707
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:12,850
首先  我們去拿回魚鉤
First, we get my hook.

708
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,530
然后拯救世界
Then save the world.

709
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:15,760
說好了
Deal?

710
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:16,870
說好了
Deal.

711
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:22,400
試試總沒錯嘛
Worth a shot.

712
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:25,420
好  我們往東走
Okay, we go east.

713
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,470
去螃蟹怪的老巢
To the lair of Tamatoa.

714
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,720
一定是那個珠子眼吃泥蟲拿了我的魚鉤
If anyone has my hook, it's that beady-eyed bottom-feeder.

715
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:46,580
教我駕船吧
Teach me to sail.

716
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:52,570
我的使命是帶毛伊穿洋過海
My job is to deliver Maui across the great ocean.

717
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:53,740
應該
I should...

718
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,710
應該我來駕船
I should be sailing.

719
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:59,510
這叫規劃導航  小公主
It's called wayfinding, princess.

720
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,680
可不止是駕船和打結
And it's not just sails and knots...

721
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:04,600
而是在腦海中清晰看見你在往哪走
it's seeing where you're going in your mind.

722
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,090
用你曾經的位置
Knowing where you are...

723
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:08,430
推斷出你現在在哪
by knowing where you've been.

724
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,300
首先  我不是公主
Okay, first, I'm not a princess.

725
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,560
我是酋長的女兒
I am the daughter of the chief.

726
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:13,750
-沒差  -不是
- Same difference. - No.

727
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:16,760
你穿著裙子  還有個動物伙伴
If you wear a dress, and you have an animal sidekick...

728
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,000
你就是個公主
you're a princess.

729
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:19,480
你可不是個規劃導航家
You are not a wayfinder.

730
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,670
也永遠不可能成為一個規劃導航家  永遠不
You will never be a wayfinder, you will never be a...

731
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,780
不是吧  往我的屁股蛋上插飛鏢
Really? Blow dart in my butt cheek?

732
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:38,780
你是個壞人
You are a bad person.

733
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,620
你能說話  就能教我
If you can talk, you can teach.

734
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,670
規劃導航
Wayfinding.

735
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,920
第一課  開始吧
Lesson one. Hit it.

736
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,590
把船帆拉起來
Pull the sheet.

737
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,420
不是那個
Not the sheet.

738
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:51,770
不是
No.

739
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:52,870
不是
Nope.

740
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:55,130
不是  不是
Nope.No.

741
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,690
那個已經試過了
Tried that one already.

742
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:05,250
你是要測量星辰  不是跟天空擊掌
You're measuring the stars, not giving the sky a high-five.

743
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:09,300
如果海流是溫的  你就走對路了
If the current's warm, you're going the right way.

744
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:12,370
是涼的
It's cold.

745
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:14,930
等下  現在變暖了
Wait, it's getting warmer.

746
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:19,890
太惡心了  你有什么毛病
That is disgusting! What is wrong with you?

747
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:37,640
我們到了
We're here?

748
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:41,030
看  告訴過你我能做到的
See, told you I could do it!

749
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:50,740
莫圖魯尼島
Motunui?

750
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:53,090
我這是回家了嗎
I'm home?

751
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,960
-莫阿娜  -爸爸
- Moana! - Dad?

752
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:01,140
莫阿娜
Moana!

753
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:02,330
媽媽
Mom?

754
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,070
救救我們
Help!

755
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:07,940
不
No!

756
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:09,580
莫阿娜
Moana!

757
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,970
美容覺睡得還滿意嗎
Enjoy your beauty rest?

758
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:17,130
要知道一個真的規劃導航家從不休息
You know, a real wayfinder never sleeps...

759
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:19,770
這樣他們才能到達目的地
so they actually get where they need to go.

760
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,000
活動一下吧  寶貝
Muscle up, buttercup.

761
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:23,630
我們到了
We're here.

762
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:27,860
你確定魚鉤在他那里嗎
You're sure this guy's gonna have your hook?

763
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,400
螃蟹怪  他會有的
Tamatoa? Oh, he'll have it.

764
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:31,720
他喜歡撿破爛
He's a scavenger.

765
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,100
覺得收集東西能讓他顯得很酷
Collects stuff. Thinks it makes him look cool.

766
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,930
所以對于螃蟹怪來說  相信我
And for Tamatoa, trust me...

767
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:40,900
我的魚鉤一定是最酷的收藏品
my hook is the coolest collectible.

768
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,480
他住在這上面嗎
And he lives up there?

769
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:46,900
不  不  不
No, no, no.

770
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,500
這只是個入口
That's just the entrance...

771
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,020
去拉羅泰
to Lalotai.

772
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,190
拉羅泰
Lalotai?

773
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:53,870
怪物王國
Realm of monsters?

774
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:56,880
我們這是要去怪物王國嗎
We're going to the realm of monsters?

775
00:54:57,050 --> 00:54:59,390
我們  不  只有我
We? No. Me.

776
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:02,100
你和另外一只雞就待在這里
You are gonna stay here with the other chicken.

777
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,690
我就是這個意思  來擊個掌
That's what I'm talking about. Gimme some.

778
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:10,050
這不挺好笑的嘛  你怎么不懂我的梗呢
Come on. That was a good one. How do you not get it?

779
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:12,510
我叫她弱雞  正好船上還有只真的雞
I called her a chicken, there's a chicken on the boat.

780
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:14,310
我知道她是人類  但這不是重...
I know she's human, but that's not the...

781
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,600
算了  算了
You know what? Forget it. Forget it!

782
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,220
不跟你解釋了
I'm not explaining it to you.

783
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:19,100
說穿了就不好玩了
'Cause then it's not funny.

784
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:35,010
那么  酋長女兒
So, daughter of the chief...

785
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:36,860
我還以為你會安心待在村莊里
I thought you stayed in the village.

786
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,910
安撫小屁孩之類的
You know, kissing babies and things.

787
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,610
我只是想試著理解
Hey, I'm just trying to understand...

788
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:43,960
為什么你的族人會派...
why your people decided to send...

789
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:46,350
怎么說呢  你
How do I phrase this? You.

790
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,540
不是我的族人派我來的
My people didn't send me.

791
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,100
大海選擇了我
The ocean did.

792
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:52,230
大海
The ocean?

793
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:53,540
真說得通
Makes sense.

794
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:55,500
你才八歲  還不會駕船
You're what, eight? Can't sail.

795
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:56,770
好一個不二人選
Obvious choice.

796
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:00,530
選我總有它自己的理由
It chose me for a reason.

797
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:02,250
假如大海真這么聰明
If the ocean's so smart...

798
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:05,000
為什么不自己動手把心石送回特菲提
why didn't it just take the heart back to Te Fiti itself?

799
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:06,940
把魚鉤還給我也行啊
Or bring me my hook?

800
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:10,080
這大海的名堂還真多
The ocean's straight up kooky-docks.

801
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:12,810
但選你肯定是沒錯的
But I'm sure it's not wrong about you.

802
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:15,180
你可是被選中的人
You're the Chosen One!

803
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:33,900
海洋選你自有它的理由
The ocean chose you for a reason.

804
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,170
你要是唱歌的話  我會吐的
If you start singing, I'm gonna throw up.

805
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:40,380
我沒看到有入口啊
So, not seeing an entrance.

806
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,620
那當然  入口要出現的話
Yes, because it only appears...

807
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,890
必須得用人祭祀
after a human sacrifice.

808
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:47,400
開玩笑啦
Kidding.

809
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:49,470
你也太當真了
So serious.

810
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:13,840
別擔心
Don't worry...

811
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:16,320
這比看上去還要深得多
it's a lot farther down than it looks.

812
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,900
我還在往下掉
I am still falling!

813
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:28,860
你能做到的
You can do this.

814
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:30,610
來吧
Go!

815
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:54,680
滿分著陸
And he sticks the landing.

816
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,280
什么  傻了吧你  她都沒在好吧
What? Bum-Gum, she's not even here.

817
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,040
沒有凡人會跳進這個怪物...
No mortal's gonna jump into the realm of...

818
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,130
她死了
Well, she's dead.

819
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,900
走吧  去拿回我的魚鉤
Okay, let's get my hook.

820
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,170
毛伊的魚鉤
Maui's fishhook!

821
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:16,300
對呀
Yeah!

822
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,230
對不起
Sorry!

823
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,410
我還以為你是個怪物
I thought you were a monster...

824
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:20,880
不過我找到了你的魚鉤
But I found your hook.

825
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,410
你說得對  螃蟹怪真的視財如命
And, you're right, this Tamatoa guy really likes his treasure.

826
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:24,240
待著
Stay.

827
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,390
什么  我才是那個發現了...
What? No. I'm the one who found...

828
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:28,370
聽著  一千年來
Listen. For a thousand years...

829
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:31,030
我只思考怎么讓頭發保持柔順
I've only been thinking of keeping this hair silky...

830
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:31,990
怎么拿回魚鉤
getting my hook...

831
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:33,800
以及怎么東山再起
and being awesome again.

832
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,290
我是絕不會讓一個凡人搞砸的
And it's not getting screwed up by a mortal...

833
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:40,080
更何況她對怪物洞穴一無所知  除非
who has no business inside of a monster cave, except...

834
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:43,450
除非...
except...

835
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,950
她當個誘餌
maybe as bait.

836
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:50,040
金光閃閃的洞穴啊
The shiny, glittery cave.

837
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,740
正好和我一樣
And just like me...

838
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:54,390
被耀眼的珍寶重重包裹著
it is covered in sparkly treasure.

839
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:56,770
一閃一閃  亮晶晶
Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle.

840
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:58,040
你這樣沒人信的
You're not selling it!

841
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,220
這蠢到家了  不如我直接走上去拿下來
This is stupid! I'm just gonna walk up and get it!

842
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:03,500
你上去的話他會殺了你的  照原計劃來
You go up there, he will kill you. Just stick to the plan.

843
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,310
他現身之后  一直吸引他注意力
When he shows up, keep him distracted.

844
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:09,010
讓他說說他自己
Make him talk about himself.

845
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:11,200
他特別喜歡臭顯擺
He loves bragging about how great he is.

846
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,100
那你倆應該很合得來了
You two must get along swell.

847
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:15,250
是啊  直到我扯斷了他的一條腿
No, not since I ripped off his leg.

848
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,000
你扯斷了他的...
You ripped off his...

849
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,730
毛伊
Maui?

850
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:30,080
看我找到了什么
What have we here?

851
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:34,820
一個金光閃閃的...  等等
It's a sparkly, shiny... Wait a minute.

852
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,550
一個人類
It's a human!

853
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:41,300
你下來這里干什么  在這個怪物...
What are you doing down here, in the realm of the...

854
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:42,560
隨便選一只眼睛盯吧
Just pick an eye, babe.

855
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,300
你這樣晃得我沒法集中注意力說話
I can't concentrate on what I'm saying if you keep...

856
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:47,140
隨便選個  選一個
Yeah, pick one, pick one!

857
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,990
你這小家伙看上去可真奇怪
You're a funny-looking little thing, aren't you?

858
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:51,480
別碰  那是我奶奶的
Don't! That's my gramma's!

859
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,620
"那是我奶奶的"
"That's my gramma's!"

860
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:54,010
我奶奶被我吃了
I ate my gramma!

861
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:56,830
我足足吃了一周  因為她太大了
And it took a week, 'cause she was absolutely humongous.

862
01:00:56,830 --> 01:00:58,160
你來這里干什么
Why are you here?

863
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:00,690
因為你太不可思議了
'Cause you're amazing!

864
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:03,410
我們凡人曾聽說過你的故事
And we mortals have heard

865
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:06,760
一只了不起的螃蟹成了傳奇
of the tale of the crab who became a legend!

866
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,650
我只是想知道
And I just had to know...

867
01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:11,910
您是怎么變得這么
how you became so...

868
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:15,000
蚌極了的
crabulous?

869
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:20,020
你是想讓我談談我自己嗎
Are you just trying to get me to talk about myself?

870
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:22,510
假如是的話
Because if you are...

871
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:24,890
那我太樂意了
I will gladly do so.

872
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,350
讓我唱給你聽
In song form!

873
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:33,050
*螃蟹怪之前并非如此魅力四射*
*Well, Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam*

874
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:35,820
*我也曾是無名小蟹*
*I was a drab little crab once*

875
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:39,570
*而如今的我笑容燦爛*
*Now I know I can be happy as a clam*

876
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,290
*只因我美麗又動人*
*Because I'm beautiful, baby*

877
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:44,310
*你奶奶是否曾說*
*And did your granny say*

878
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:46,180
*聆聽自己的心聲*
*Listen to your heart*

879
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:49,020
*勇敢做心中的自己*
*Be who you are on the inside*

880
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,650
*我用三個詞就能推翻她*
*I need three words to tear her argument apart*

881
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:54,020
*你  奶奶  騙人*
*Your granny lied*

882
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:56,230
*我寧可絢麗奪目*
*I'd rather be shiny*

883
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:59,260
*如同那海盜的沉船寶藏*
*Like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck*

884
01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:02,730
*把甲板洗刷得閃閃發亮吧*
*Scrub the deck and make it look shiny*

885
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:05,820
*我會像貴婦的項鏈一般閃耀*
*I will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck*

886
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:08,510
*只需一秒  你難道不知道嗎*
*Just a sec don't ya know*

887
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:12,450
*魚兒們蠢  蠢  蠢  追逐一切發光體*
*Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb they chase anything that glitters*

888
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:14,130
*太幼稚*
*Beginners*

889
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:16,770
*現在他們向我沖  沖  沖*
*And here they come, come, come*

890
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:19,380
*只因我是最奪目的光源*
*To the brightest thing that glitters*

891
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:20,340
*魚肉晚餐*
*Fish dinners*

892
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,890
*我就是喜歡送上門來的*
*I just love free food*

893
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:26,140
*你看上去也像海鮮大餐*
*And you look like seafood*

894
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:27,490
不
No!

895
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:29,280
蟹肉餅
Hey,  crab cake!

896
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,540
我回來了
I'm back.

897
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:38,040
輪到毛伊上場了
It's Maui Time!

898
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,170
變什么好呢  小家伙
What do you say, little buddy?

899
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,950
巨鷹嗎  那就來吧
Giant hawk? Coming up!

900
01:02:56,790 --> 01:02:58,500
哎呦呦
Well, well, well.

901
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:01,860
*小毛伊的變形術不聽使喚啦*
*Little Maui's having trouble with his look*

902
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:04,540
*你這個小半神*
*Ya little semi-demi-mini-god*

903
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:07,060
*表現可真糟糕*
*What a terrible performance*

904
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:08,610
*拿到魚鉤又怎樣*
*Get the hook get it?*

905
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:11,860
*你早已不復當年了  老兄*
*You don't swing it like you used to, man*

906
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:15,010
*但謝謝你成就了現在的我*
*Yet I have to give you credit for my start*

907
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:17,990
*還有你身上的紋身*
*And your tattoos on the outside*

908
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:21,690
*我也學著你把自己裝飾成藝術品*
*For just like you I made myself a work of art*

909
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:23,450
*我不會躲藏  也藏不住*
*I'll never hide I can't*

910
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:25,060
*我是如此閃耀*
*I'm too shiny*

911
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:28,150
*像璞玉一般耀眼奪目*
*Watch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough*

912
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:31,720
*誰讓它們如此金光閃閃*
*Strut my stuff my stuff is so shiny*

913
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,610
*你盡管出招  都是螳臂當車而已*
*Send your armies but they'll never be enough*

914
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:37,370
*我的外殼是如此堅硬  毛伊*
*My Shell's too tough Maui, man*

915
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:41,450
*你盡管來呀  來呀  來呀  但別指望一個半神*
*You can try, try, try but you can't expect a demigod*

916
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:43,890
*打敗一個多足怪  走著瞧*
*To beat a decapod look it up*

917
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:45,730
*你馬上就死啦  死啦  死啦*
*You will die, die, die*

918
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:48,360
*讓我來粉碎*
*Now it's time for me to take apart*

919
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,020
*你那脆弱的小心靈吧*
*Your achin' heart*

920
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:55,110
*遠離那些曾拋棄你的人*
*Far from the ones who abandoned you*

921
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:59,680
*追求著人類的愛*
*Chasing the love of these humans*

922
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,950
*讓你自己覺得被需要*
*Who made you feel wanted*

923
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:05,770
*你也曾試著堅強*
*You tried to be tough*

924
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:09,730
*只可惜你的外殼不如我堅硬*
*But your armor's just not hard enough*

925
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:14,490
*毛伊  該換我踢你屁股了*
*Maui Now it's time to kick your heinie*

926
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:17,710
*從沒見過這么耀眼的我吧*
*Ever seen someone so shiny*

927
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:20,620
*死之前再好好看吧*
*Soak it in 'cause it's the last you'll ever see*

928
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,720
*這就是人生  我的朋友*
*C'est la vie mon ami*

929
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,310
*我如此閃耀*
*I'm so shiny*

930
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:27,550
*盤中餐快寫好遺愿吧*
*Now I eat you so prepare your final plea*

931
01:04:27,550 --> 01:04:29,130
*只能求我*
*Just for me*

932
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:32,800
*你永遠不會這么閃亮*
*You'll never be quite as shiny*

933
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:38,990
*你會希望你也能閃亮又美麗的*
*You wish you were nice and shiny*

934
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,270
我有個閃亮的東西給你
I got something shiny for ya!

935
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,460
特菲提之心
The heart of Te Fiti.

936
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:49,880
你逃不出我的手掌的
You can't run from me!

937
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:52,780
好吧你跑了  還真是一直給我驚喜啊
Oh, you can. You keep surprising me.

938
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:57,660
你的兩條小短腿只能跑到這里了
There's only so far you can get on those two little legs.

939
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:03,620
創造一切的力量
The power of creation...

940
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:05,350
歸屬于身披甲殼的我啦
for a crustacean.

941
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:07,420
去哪兒了  去哪兒了
Where is it? Where is it?

942
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,950
快走
We gotta go!

943
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:10,890
那顆心怎么辦
What about the heart?

944
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:13,680
就讓他拿著吧  我有顆更好的
He can have it. I've got a better one.

945
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:16,580
太好了  我得到了
Yes, I have the...

946
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:17,560
等一下
Wait a minute.

947
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,690
我懂了  她把藤壺
I see, she's taken a barnacle

948
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:23,860
涂滿發光藻  來糊弄我
and she's covered it in bioluminescent algae as a diversion.

949
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:27,580
給我回來
Come back here!

950
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:37,570
那首歌你們還喜歡嗎
Did you like the song?

951
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,480
我們還活著
We're alive!

952
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:48,340
我們還活著
We're alive!

953
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:50,870
聽著
Listen...

954
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:53,930
我很感謝你在下面所做的一切
I appreciate what you did down there.

955
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,180
那需要很大的勇氣
Took guts.

956
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:56,540
不過呢
But...

957
01:05:56,670 --> 01:05:57,510
不好意思
I'm sorry.

958
01:05:57,510 --> 01:05:59,240
我難得這么認真地講心里話
I'm trying to be sincere for once,

959
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,210
但你似乎總是注意力不集中
and it feels like you're distracted.

960
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:03,320
沒有  才沒有  不會啦
No, no. No way!

961
01:06:03,330 --> 01:06:05,790
是嗎  可你看我的眼神就好像我長了個...
Really? Because you're looking at me like I have a...

962
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:09,750
鯊魚頭
shark head.

963
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:12,910
什么  你有個鯊魚頭嗎
What? Do you have a shark head?

964
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,990
聽著  重點是
Look, the point is...

965
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:18,040
對于一個小女孩  小屁孩  之類的
for a little girl, child, thing, whatever...

966
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,500
之前根本沒下去過
who had no business being down there...

967
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:22,490
你幫了我一個大忙
you did me a solid.

968
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:24,750
但你也差點死掉
But you also almost died.

969
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:27,040
我也差點輸給那只蠢螃蟹
And I couldn't even beat that dumb crab.

970
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,260
至于打敗特卡的勝算
So, chances of beating Te Ka?

971
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:30,740
約等于零
Bupkis.

972
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:32,660
我們永遠到不了特菲提
We're never making it to Te Fiti.

973
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:34,110
這一次任務被詛咒了
This mission is cursed.

974
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:36,070
沒有被詛咒
It's not cursed.

975
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,180
鯊魚頭
Shark head.

976
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:40,240
這并不是詛咒
It is not cursed.

977
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:55,340
被詛咒了
Cursed.

978
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:01,780
*我能說的只有一句*
*What can I say except*

979
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:03,660
*我們快死啦*
*We're dead soon*

980
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:05,790
*我們快死啦*
*We're dead soon*

981
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:08,520
你就不能試試嗎
Can you at least try?

982
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:12,880
巨鷹
Giant hawk.

983
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:18,300
*沒關系  沒關系  反正也快死了*
*Hey, it's okay, it's okay we're dead soon*

984
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,550
好了  休息時間結束
All right, break time's over.

985
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:21,420
起來
Get up.

986
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:24,080
怎么  你要灌我心靈雞湯嗎
Why? Are you gonna give me a speech?

987
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:28,310
告訴我我能打敗特卡  就因為我是"毛伊"
Tell me I can beat Te Ka 'cause I'm "Maui?"

988
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:31,080
哪涼快那歇著去  小不點
Take a hike, Tiny.

989
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:39,610
你的紋身是怎么來的
How do you get your tattoos?

990
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:42,270
我完成一件壯舉  他們便會自己出現
They show up. When I earn them.

991
01:07:42,770 --> 01:07:45,570
那這個又是怎么來的呢
How'd you earn that one? What's that for?

992
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:49,340
是因為發現"不你事"
That's man's discovery of Nunya.

993
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:50,480
"不你事"是什么
What's Nunya?

994
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,820
不關你的事兒
Nunya business.

995
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:55,090
那我只好繼續問了
I'll just keep asking.

996
01:07:57,410 --> 01:07:58,450
這個是怎么來的
What's it for?

997
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,650
別鬧了
You need to stop doing that.

998
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,190
-滾開  -告訴我這是怎么來的嘛
- Back off. - Just tell me what it is.

999
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:09,030
我說了滾開
I said back off.

1000
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:10,810
所以你的魚鉤才不起作用嗎
Is it why your hook's not working?

1001
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:29,700
你不想開口  就別開口了
You don't wanna talk, don't talk.

1002
01:08:30,070 --> 01:08:32,360
你想把我扔下船
You wanna throw me off the boat...

1003
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,870
就扔我下去吧
throw me off.

1004
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:37,320
你想告訴我  我不知道自己在做什么
You wanna tell me I don't know what I'm doing...

1005
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:39,510
我的確不知道
I know I don't.

1006
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,830
我完全不知道為什么大海選擇了我
I have no idea why the ocean chose me.

1007
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,220
你是對的
You're right.

1008
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:50,190
但我的島嶼正在消亡
But my island is dying...

1009
01:08:51,150 --> 01:08:53,720
所以我來到了這兒
so I am here.

1010
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,090
這里只有我和你
It's just me and you.

1011
01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:59,640
我想幫你
And I want to help...

1012
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:04,590
但你若拒絕幫助  我也無能為力
but I can't if you don't let me.

1013
01:09:09,910 --> 01:09:12,700
我并非生來就是半神
I wasn't born a demigod.

1014
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,740
我的父母都是人類
I had human parents.

1015
01:09:15,950 --> 01:09:16,940
他們
They uh...

1016
01:09:17,530 --> 01:09:21,060
他們看了我一眼
They took one look and decided...

1017
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,660
然后決定遺棄我
they did not want me.

1018
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:26,500
他們把我扔進了海里
They threw me into the sea...

1019
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:30,030
好像我無關緊要
like I was nothing.

1020
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:35,000
機緣巧合下  我被眾神發現了
Somehow, I was found by the gods.

1021
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:36,970
眾神給了我魚鉤
They gave me the hook.

1022
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:39,120
眾神讓我成為了
They made me...

1023
01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:40,680
毛伊
Maui.

1024
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:44,750
我回到了人類世界中
And back to the humans I went.

1025
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:48,810
我為人類帶來島嶼  火和椰子
I gave them islands, fire, coconuts.

1026
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:51,880
他們想要的所有東西
Anything they could ever want.

1027
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,000
你是為他們才偷走心石的
You took the heart for them.

1028
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:59,000
你所做的一切都是為了他們
You did everything for them.

1029
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,300
為了他們能愛戴你
So they'd love you.

1030
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:05,190
而他們永不滿足
It was never enough.

1031
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:16,700
也許眾神發現你是有原因的
Maybe the gods found you for a reason.

1032
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,880
也許是大海把你帶給了他們
Maybe the ocean brought you to them...

1033
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:24,120
因為它認為你值得救
because it saw someone who was worthy of being saved.

1034
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:28,990
但并不是眾神讓你成為了毛伊
But the gods aren't the ones who make you Maui.

1035
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:31,180
你才是
You are.

1036
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:42,570
好啦好啦
Okay, okay.

1037
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:45,470
我也愛你  兄弟
I love you, too, buddy.

1038
01:12:17,450 --> 01:12:19,690
下一站  特菲提
Next stop, Te Fiti.

1039
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:07,700
怎么
What?

1040
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:09,010
我想明白了
I figured it out.

1041
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:14,030
大海曾經很喜歡我從海面升起島嶼
You know, the ocean used to love when I pulled up islands...

1042
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:18,050
這樣你的祖先們就能駛過海洋去找了
'cause your ancestors would sail her seas and find 'em.

1043
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:21,840
所有那些新的土地  新的村莊
All those new lands, new villages.

1044
01:13:22,270 --> 01:13:24,450
是海水讓他們連接起來
It was the water that connected 'em all.

1045
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,670
如果我是海洋
And if I were the ocean...

1046
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:31,310
我想我也會找一個卷發的非公主
I think I'd be looking for a curly-haired non-princess...

1047
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:33,230
讓這一切重新來過
to start that again.

1048
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:38,540
這真的是你對我講過的最友好的話
That is literally the nicest thing you've ever said to me.

1049
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,750
也許該留到我們到了特菲提再說
Probably should have saved it for Te Fiti.

1050
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:43,930
到了
I did.

1051
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:49,000
莫圖魯尼島的莫阿娜
Moana of Motunui...

1052
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:50,620
我相信
I believe you have

1053
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:54,780
你已真正帶毛伊穿洋過海
officially delivered Maui across the great sea.

1054
01:13:56,130 --> 01:13:58,940
莫阿娜  莫阿娜  莫阿娜
Moana! Moana! Moana!

1055
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:00,760
你真了不起
You're so amazing!

1056
01:14:02,590 --> 01:14:03,710
是時候了
It's time.

1057
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:23,530
去拯救世界吧
Go save the world.

1058
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:47,910
毛伊
Maui!

1059
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:23,990
你要干什么
What are you doing?

1060
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,850
幫你找到一條更好的路
Finding you a better way in!

1061
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:29,550
-不會成功的  -會的
- We won't make it! - Yes, we will!

1062
01:15:29,550 --> 01:15:30,730
-掉頭  -不
- Turn around! - No!

1063
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:31,820
莫阿娜  停下
Moana, stop!

1064
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:32,680
不
No!

1065
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,770
你還好嗎
Are you okay?

1066
01:16:04,590 --> 01:16:05,520
毛伊
Maui?

1067
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:14,930
我告訴過你  掉頭
I told you to turn back.

1068
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:19,220
我以為我們能成功
I thought we could make it.

1069
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:20,440
我們
We?

1070
01:16:21,990 --> 01:16:24,160
我以為我能成功
I thought I could make it.

1071
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,260
我們能修好它
We can fix it.

1072
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:29,370
這是眾神做的
It was made by the gods.

1073
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,300
修不了
You can't fix it!

1074
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:33,630
下一次我們會更小心的
Next time we'll be more careful.

1075
01:16:34,330 --> 01:16:36,360
特卡被困在礁島上
Te Ka was stuck on the barrier islands.

1076
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,820
它是熔巖  不能入水
It's lava, it can't go in the water.

1077
01:16:38,890 --> 01:16:40,310
我們能找條路繞過去
We can find a way around.

1078
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:42,250
我不會回去的
I'm not going back.

1079
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,910
我們還是得歸還心石
We still have to restore the heart.

1080
01:16:46,110 --> 01:16:47,410
我的魚鉤裂了
My hook is cracked.

1081
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:49,280
再撞一次  就完了
One more hit, and it's over.

1082
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,500
毛伊  你必須歸還心石
Maui, you have to restore the heart.

1083
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,680
沒有魚鉤  我就什么也不是了
Without my hook, I am nothing.

1084
01:16:53,690 --> 01:16:54,910
這不是真的
That's not true!

1085
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:57,290
沒有魚鉤  我就什么也不是了
Without my hook, I am nothing!

1086
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:08,410
我們會在這兒
We are only here...

1087
01:17:08,410 --> 01:17:11,280
都是因為你當初偷了這塊心石
because you stole the heart in the first place.

1088
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:15,640
不  我們在這兒是因為大海說你是特別的
No, we're here because the ocean told you you're special...

1089
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:16,830
而且你相信了
and you believed it.

1090
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:21,470
我是莫圖魯尼島的莫阿娜
I am Moana of Motunui.

1091
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,660
-你要跟我上船  -再見  莫阿娜
- You will board my boat... - Goodbye, Moana.

1092
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:24,890
穿過大海
...sail across the sea...

1093
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:26,190
我不想自取滅亡
I'm not killing myself...

1094
01:17:26,190 --> 01:17:27,350
就為了讓你證明你并不是的虛妄
so you can prove you're something you're not!

1095
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:29,450
歸還特菲提之心
...and restore the heart of Te Fiti!

1096
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:31,720
大海選擇了我
The ocean chose me!

1097
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:34,210
它選錯了
It chose wrong.

1098
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:45,890
毛伊
Maui!

1099
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:02,400
為什么你把我帶到這兒
Why did you bring me here?

1100
01:18:07,870 --> 01:18:10,010
我不是正確人選
I'm not the right person.

1101
01:18:12,330 --> 01:18:15,100
你必須選擇別人了
You have to choose someone else.

1102
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:20,190
選擇別人吧
Choose someone else.

1103
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:22,400
拜托了
Please.

1104
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,660
不
No.

1105
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:01,680
你現在可離環礁遠遠的了
You're a long ways past the reef.

1106
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:03,270
奶奶
Gramma?

1107
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:08,320
我真是選對了紋身
Guess I chose the right tattoo.

1108
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:10,280
奶奶
Gramma!

1109
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:17,170
我試過了  奶奶
I tried, Gramma.

1110
01:19:17,690 --> 01:19:21,410
我做不到
I...I couldn't do it.

1111
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:23,890
這不是你的錯
It's not your fault.

1112
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:28,210
我不該給你這樣沉重的壓力
I never should have put so much on your shoulders.

1113
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:31,330
如果你想回家
If you are ready to go home...

1114
01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:35,230
我會陪你一起
I will be with you.

1115
01:19:51,290 --> 01:19:53,000
你為什么猶豫了呢
Why do you hesitate?

1116
01:19:54,190 --> 01:19:55,290
我不知道
I don't know.

1117
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:02,340
*我認識一個小島上的女孩*
*I know a girl from an island*

1118
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:05,610
*她與眾不同*
*She stands apart from the crowd*

1119
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:09,000

*有時世界像是故意為難*
*Sometimes the world seems against you*

1122
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:19,040
*旅程讓人受傷*
*The journey may leave a scar*

1123
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:22,190
*但是傷痕愈合  并提醒你*
*But scars can heal and reveal just*

1124
01:20:22,190 --> 01:20:24,920
*你身處何方*
*Where you are*

1125
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:28,770
*你因愛的人改變*
*The people you love will change you*

1126
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:31,940
*學到的將為你指路*

1127
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:35,440
*但一切都不能平息*

1128
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:38,870
*你心底的那個聲音*

1129
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:42,080
*當那個聲音開始悄聲訴說*

1130
01:20:42,490 --> 01:20:45,390
*莫阿娜  你都走到這一步了*

1131
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:47,690
*莫阿娜  聽啊*

1132
01:20:47,930 --> 01:20:53,190
*你知道你是誰嗎*
*Do you know who you are?*

1133
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:55,880
我是誰
Who am I?

1134
01:20:58,290 --> 01:21:01,890
*我是深愛我的小島的女孩*

1135
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:04,930
*我也深愛著大海*

1136
01:21:06,170 --> 01:21:09,110
*它呼喚著我*

1137
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:14,190
*我是酋長的女兒*

1138
01:21:14,610 --> 01:21:17,910
*我們是航海者的后裔*

1139
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:20,590
*他們穿越海洋  尋找方向*
*Who found their way across the world*

1140
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:23,500
*他們呼喚著我*
*They call me*

1141
01:21:24,530 --> 01:21:27,190
*我帶我們跋涉至此*

1142
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:30,150
*我去過遠方*

1143
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:33,260
*我不僅是我所學的一切*

1144
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:36,770
*有聲音在呼喚我*
*Still it calls me*

1145
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,650
*這聲音不是來自外部*
*And the call isn't out there at all*

1146
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:43,040
*而是在我心底*
*It's inside me*

1147
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,340
*如潮水般*
*It's like the tide*

1148
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:49,930
*漲漲落落*
*Always falling and rising*

1149
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,370
*我將把你珍藏心底*
*I will carry you here in my heart*

1150
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:55,850
*時刻提醒著我*

1151
01:21:55,850 --> 01:21:58,910

1152
01:21:58,910 --> 01:22:02,090

1153
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:06,970
*我是莫阿娜*
*I am Moana*

1154
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:44,020
我是莫圖魯尼島的莫阿娜
I am Moana of Motunui.

1155
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,400
跟我上船
Aboard my boat...

1156
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,660
我將穿過大海
I will sail across the sea...

1157
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:51,730
歸還特菲提之心
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

1158
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:30,170
特卡不能隨我們入水
Te Ka can't follow us into the water.

1159
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:32,560
要是我們能駛過礁島
We make it past the barrier islands...

1160
01:23:33,030 --> 01:23:34,600
我們就能到達特菲提
we make it to Te Fiti.

1161
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:36,520
你一點都不明白我在說什么
None of which you understand...

1162
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:38,300
因為你是只雞
because you are a chicken.

1163
01:24:44,990 --> 01:24:46,090
不
No!

1164
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:49,880
憨憨  不不不
Heihei! No, no, no!

1165
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,070
干得好
Nice work!

1166
01:25:01,990 --> 01:25:03,140
特菲提
Te Fiti.

1167
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:29,380

你回來了
You came back.

1169
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:39,910
但你的魚鉤
But your hook.

1170
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,280
再撞一次它就...
One more hit and...

1171
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,480
特卡得先抓住我才行
Te Ka's gotta catch me first.

1172
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:48,890
我掩護你  被選中的人
I got your back, Chosen One.

1173
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:50,900
去拯救世界吧
Go save the world.

1174
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:52,130

1176
01:25:54,630 --> 01:25:55,790
別客氣
You're welcome.

1177
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:18,880
燙燙燙  好燙好燙
Hot-hot-hot, hot-hot-hot!

1178
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:30,870
特卡
Hey, Te Ka!

1179
01:26:32,070 --> 01:26:33,370
鯊魚頭
Shark head!

1180
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:46,960
莫阿娜
Moana!

1181
01:26:56,770 --> 01:26:58,820
把心石放入螺旋中
Get the heart to the spiral!

1182
01:27:37,230 --> 01:27:38,270
特菲提
Te Fiti...

1183
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:40,630
消失了
it's gone.

1184
01:27:53,410 --> 01:27:54,680
特卡
Te Ka!

1185
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,380
讓她走向我
Let her come to me.

1186
01:28:55,550 --> 01:28:59,650
*我穿越海平線來找你*
*I have crossed the horizon to find you*

1187
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:09,150
*我知道你的名字*
*I know your name*

1188
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:17,550
*他們偷了你的心*
*They have stolen the heart from inside you*

1189
01:29:20,990 --> 01:29:24,300
*但這不能定義你*
*But this does not define you*

1190
01:29:27,580 --> 01:29:32,210
*這不是真正的你*
*This is not who you are*

1191
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:39,280
*你知道你是誰*
*You know who you are*

1192
01:29:45,490 --> 01:29:47,910
*真正的你*
*Who you truly are*

1193
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:12,820
特菲提
Te Fiti!

1194
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,420
這只雞活下來了
The chicken lives.

1195
01:30:56,150 --> 01:30:58,320
你的魚鉤  我很遺憾
I'm sorry about your hook.

1196
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:01,410
有沒有魚鉤
Well, hook, no hook...

1197
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:03,400
我都是毛伊
I'm Maui.

1198
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:23,990
特菲提
Te Fiti!

1199
01:31:25,250 --> 01:31:27,940
你過得好嗎
Hey, I mean, how you been?

1200
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:32,880
我所做過的事
Look, what I did was...

1201
01:31:33,310 --> 01:31:34,260
是錯的
wrong.

1202
01:31:34,930 --> 01:31:36,430
沒有借口
I have no excuse.

1203
01:31:37,540 --> 01:31:38,570
對不起
I'm sorry.

1204
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:50,800
不接受女神的禮物可是不禮貌的哦
You know, it'd be rude to refuse a gift from a goddess.

1205
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:57,110
謝謝你
Thank you.

1206
01:31:57,110 --> 01:31:59,920
我非常感激你的好意
Your kind gesture is deeply appreciated.

1207
01:32:49,650 --> 01:32:51,130
我會想你的  小雞腿
Gonna miss you, drumstick.

1208
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:52,740
你可以和我們一起走
You could come with us, you know.

1209
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:56,870
我的族人需要一位規劃導航大師
My people are going to need a master wayfinder.

1210
01:32:58,310 --> 01:32:59,750
他們已經有一位了
They already have one.

1211
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:20,040
再會了  毛伊
See you out there, Maui.

1212
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:22,920
再會了  莫阿娜
See you out there, Moana.

1213
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,790
媽媽  爸爸
Mom! Dad!

1214
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:19,280
莫阿娜
Moana!

1215
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:31,990
我可能稍微有點越過環礁了
I may have gone a little ways past the reef.

1216
01:34:33,030 --> 01:34:34,420
這才是你
It suits you.

1217
01:34:34,770 --> 01:34:36,410
她回來了
She's back!

1218
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:38,160

1219
01:34:43,410 --> 01:34:44,860
歡迎回家
Welcome home!

1220
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:36,960
*我們啟航漫游*
*We set a course to find*

1221
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:41,810
*尋找新的家園*
*A brand new island everywhere we roam*

1222
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:46,540
*故土永在心中*

1223
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:51,770
*念時即能歸鄉*
*And when it's time to find home we know the way*

1224
01:35:52,690 --> 01:35:55,990
*我們是解讀一切的探險家*
*We are explorers reading every sign*

1225
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:01,540
*我們的故事世代相傳  永不終結*
*We tell the stories of our elders in a never-ending chain*

1226
01:36:07,930 --> 01:36:11,090
*我們認得回家的路*
*We know the way*

1227
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:18,910
{\an8}海洋奇緣

1228
01:36:21,110 --> 01:36:24,960
*從很久前我就喜歡眺望*
*I've been staring at the edge of the water*

1229
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,900
*海平面的盡頭*
*Long as I can remember*

1230
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:30,950
*卻從不明白原因*
*Never really knowing why*

1231
01:36:32,210 --> 01:36:36,280
*我希望能做個聽話的女兒*
*I wish I could be the perfect daughter*

1232
01:36:36,340 --> 01:36:39,000
*但無論我如何努力*
*But I come back to the water*

1233
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,890
*都還是回到這海洋*
*No matter how hard I try*

1234
01:36:42,970 --> 01:36:45,730
*經過每個轉彎  走過每條小徑*
*Every turn I take, every trail I track*

1235
01:36:45,730 --> 01:36:48,600
*踏過每條小路  都引領我回到*
*Every path I make, every road leads back*

1236
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:51,300
*那個我不能去*
*To the place I know where I cannot go*

1237
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:54,490
*卻無比向往的地方*
*Where I long to be*

1238
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:59,040
*看那海天相接*
*See the line where the sky meets the sea*

1239
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:01,370
*它呼喚著我*
*It calls me*

1240
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:04,180
*有誰知道*
*And no one knows*

1241
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:06,890
*它延伸到多遠*
*How far it goes*

1242
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:12,090
*如果海風助我  揚帆起航*
*If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me*

1243
01:37:12,270 --> 01:37:15,080
*我終會知道*
*One day I'll know*

1244
01:37:15,510 --> 01:37:19,420
*若我啟程  前途無限*
*If I go, there's just no telling how far I'll go*

1245
01:37:29,180 --> 01:37:32,740
*我知道這座島上的每個人*
*I know everybody on this island*

1246
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:35,660
*似乎對島上生活快樂無憂*
*Seems so happy on this island*

1247
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:38,950
*一切早已安排好*

1248
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:43,330
*我知道這座島上的每個人*

1249
01:37:43,330 --> 01:37:46,190
*都有自己的在島上的職責*
*Has a role on this island*

1250
01:37:46,190 --> 01:37:49,470
*所以或許我也該坦然接受*
*So maybe I can roll with mine*

1251
01:37:49,770 --> 01:37:52,610
*我可以驕傲地領導  讓部族更強*
*I can lead with pride I can make us strong*

1252
01:37:52,610 --> 01:37:55,270
*若我遵循傳統  應該也會心滿意足*
*I'll be satisfied if I play along*

1253
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,930
*但心里卻一直唱著另一首歌*
*But the voice inside sings a different song*

1254
01:37:57,930 --> 01:38:02,330
*我這是怎么了*
*What is wrong with me*

1255
01:38:02,330 --> 01:38:05,240
*看遠方海上陽光閃耀*
*See the light as it shines on the sea*

1256
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:07,690
*令人目眩*
*It's blinding*

1257
01:38:07,790 --> 01:38:10,430
*有誰知道*
*But no one knows*

1258
01:38:10,430 --> 01:38:13,370
*它能照到多深*
