1
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,400
兩千年前  戰國時期  中國共分為七個國家
{\an8}Two thousand years ago... during the Warring States period, China was divided into seven Kingdoms.

2
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,500
多年來  七國之間為了爭權奪霸  戰亂連連  各國百姓苦不堪言
{\an8}For years they battled for supremacy while the people suffered.

3
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,600
而在征伐諸國  試圖一統天下的七國君王中  秦王是最暴虐無情的一個
{\an8}The King of Qin was the most ruthless in his efforts to conquer the land and unify all under heaven.

4
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,700
他被其他六國視為共同的威脅
{\an8}He was regarded as a common threat by the other six Kingdoms.

5
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,800
中國歷代編年史中記載了許多刺殺君王的史實
{\an8}The annals of Chinese history are abound with tales of the assassins sent to kill the great King.

6
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,000
這是其中的一個傳奇故事
{\an8}This is one of those legends...

7
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,830
我  自幼便為孤兒
I was orphaned at an early age.

8
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,700
也沒有名字  人稱無名
I had no name, so people called me Nameless.

9
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,040
人若無名  便可專心練劍
Being a nobody, I studied swordsmanship.

10
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,350
我花十年
After 10 years of practice,

11
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,490
練成一種獨特劍法
I acquired a unique skill.

12
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,320
秦王緊急召見我
The King of Qin has summoned me.

13
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,120
是因為我已辦成一件驚動秦國的大事
My deeds have astonished the Kingdom.

14
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,910
臣奉我王之命
By order of his Majesty,

15
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,210
接壯士星夜兼程趕回  拜見丞相
we have brought the mighty warrior.

16
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,840
長空  飛雪  殘劍
Sky, Flying Snow and Broken Sword,

17
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,810
這三名趙國刺客
the three assassins from Zhao

18
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,610
十年來謀刺我王
have sought his Majesty's life. For 10 years

19
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,120
令我王一日不得安睡
his Majesty has known no peace.

20
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,990
怎料今日
To the astonishment of all

21
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,930
卻被我大秦壯士一舉擊破
a mighty warrior of Qin has smashed them.

22
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,210
從此我王可以高枕無憂了
His Majesty can finally sleep at night!

23
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,140
臣等恭賀我王
We rejoice for our King!

24
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,940
天降壯士
This warrior sent from heaven

25
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,150
剪除刺客
has exterminated the assassins.

26
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,180
大王令  召壯士
Summon the warrior!

27
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,660
上殿拜見大王  需在百步之外
Remain 100 paces from his Majesty.

28
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,360
否則格殺勿論  壯士切記
Or you will be executed. Never forget that.

29
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,980
十年來  從未有人上殿近寡人百步
No one is allowed within 100 paces of me.

30
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,320
可知為何
Do you know why?

31
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,190
刺客猖獗
To guard against assassins.

32
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,970
不錯  刺客一日不除  我難解甲冑
Yes. That's why I am confined in this armor.

33
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:05,100
如今你替寡人除此大害
You have removed a great peril for me.

34
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,470
要何封賞
How should I reward you?

35
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,240
為秦殺賊  不求封賞
My service was for Qin, not for a reward.

36
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,510
大秦治下  必有封賞
Achievements must be rewarded.

37
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,650
長空銀槍
Sky's silver spear...

38
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,990
曾傷我大秦多少壯士
wounded many of my brave warriors.

39
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,730
宣我法令
Announce my edict!

40
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,130
大王法令
By order of his Majesty,

41
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,640
有破刺客長空者  賞千金  封千戶侯
he who kills Sky will receive gold and land

42
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,140
上殿二十步
and be allowed to drink

43
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,780
與王對飲
within 20 paces of his Majesty.

44
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,840
據寡人接報  你是我秦國人
I am informed you're a citizen of Qin.

45
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,510
臣  狼孟縣亭長無名
I am a Prefect from Leng Meng County.

46
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,710
區區亭長  轄區不過十里
A County Prefect over 10 square miles!

47
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,080
是我大秦國最小的官吏
Surely the lowest-ranking official in Qin

48
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,450
有何本事  能破趙國的三大刺客
how did you defeat such opponents?

49
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,060
各個擊破
I took them on one by one.

50
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,230
仔細講來
Tell me the details.

51
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,760
大王可知
Does Your Majesty know

52
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,300
殘劍  飛雪為一對情侶
Flying Snow and Broken Sword were lovers?

53
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,010
寡人知道
Yes, I do.

54
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,110
大王可曾聽說  他們三年無話
And that they hadn't spoken for three years?

55
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,810
三年無話  為何
For three years? Why?

56
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,950
皆因飛雪與長空曾有一夜之情
Flying Snow had an affair with Sky.

57
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,750
使殘劍耿耿於懷
Broken Sword never forgave her.

58
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,460
寡人怎麼未曾聽說呀
Why haven't I heard this before?

59
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,130
臣想方設法  才獲此秘情
I went to great lengths to uncover it.

60
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,770
所以分化殘劍飛雪
To divide Flying Snow and Broken Sword.

61
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,730
必先取長空
I first needed to eliminate Sky.

62
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,010
你的做法  寡人猜到一二了
I have an idea of what you planned.

63
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,680
大王賢明
Your Majesty is wise.

64
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,310
對長空  你以何為戰
What did you use to defeat Sky?

65
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,680
劍
The sword.

66
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,820
在狼孟縣  臣掌管緝捕盜賊
I must arrest criminals in my county.

67
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,120
六月初五
On the fifth day of the sixth month.

68
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,860
長空在一家棋館內現身
Sky attended a chess house.

69
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,330
臣打聽到
I had learnt he enjoyed playing chess

70
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,370
他常來此地下棋聽琴
and listening to music there.

71
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,590
秦宮七大高手
So, the seven masters of Qin Palace.

72
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,330
跟你多日  拿你歸案
We are here to arrest you!

73
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,240
亮出銀槍  驗明正身
Identify yourself by showing your spear.

74
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,190
慢
Halt!

75
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,830
小小亭長  有何貴幹
What can a minor official do?

76
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,010
此地歸我轄管
This is my territory.

77
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,480
如何
So?

78
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,640
你乃大王通緝的要犯
You are on the King's most wanted list.

79
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,410
我當拿你歸案
I am placing you under arrest.

80
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,400
老先生  請再撫一曲
Old man, please play one more tune.

81
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,810
武功琴韻雖不相同
Martial arts and music are different,

82
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,750
但原理相通
but they share the same principle.

83
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,010
都講求大音希聲之境界
Both stress attaining a supreme state.

84
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,360
臣和長空面對面站著  有半個時辰
Sky and I faced each other for a long time.

85
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,460
雖然誰也沒動
Neither of us moved.

86
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,360
但決鬥已經在彼此的意念中繼續展開
We fought the battle in our minds.

87
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,190
好快的劍
How swift thy sword!

88
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:18,490
寡人自恃對秦國的一草一木瞭如指掌
I thought I knew everything about my Kingdom.

89
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,360
卻不知狼孟縣內
I didn't know that Leng Meng County

90
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,840
居然有你這樣的人才
held a talent like yours.

91
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,970
殘劍
Broken Sword.

92
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,820
飛雪
Flying Snow.

93
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,460
大王法令
By order of his Majesty!

94
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,320
刺客殘劍  刺客飛雪
Flying Snow and Broken Sword

95
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,120
素來聯手行刺
have teamed up for assassination,

96
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,860
有誅殺二人中任何一人者
he who kills either of them

97
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,730
賞萬金  封五千戶侯
will receive gold and land

98
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,030
上殿十步
and be allowed to drink

99
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,870
與王對飲
within 10 paces of his Majesty.

100
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:09,570
三年前
Three years ago, Flying Snow

101
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,200
雙劍聯手攻入宮中
stormed the palace with Broken Sword.

102
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:16,070
三千鐵甲竟不能擋
3000 elite troops couldn't stop them.

103
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:21,280
從此寡人將這大殿清掃一空
I've since emptied the palace,

104
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,980
使刺客無法藏身
so assassins cannot hide.

105
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,550
你的劍竟能快過此二人
Was your sword swifter than theirs combined?

106
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:28,750
不能
No.

107
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,700
那你如何取勝
How did you do it, then?

108
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,020
臣喬裝成趙人
Disguised as a citizen of Zhao.

109
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,650
去趙國尋找殘劍飛雪
I sought them in the Kingdom of Zhao.

110
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,410
臣探聽到
I learned they were hiding.

111
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,220
兩人化名高山  流水
In a calligraphy school.

112
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,320
藏身於趙國陘城一家書館
Under the names Highcliff and Springbrook.

113
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,660
那天風聞
Rumor had it

114
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,800
大王大軍將要攻趙
the Qin army would attack that day.

115
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,370
陘城中百姓已逃散一空
Most of the townspeople had fled.

116
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,570
只餘下書館弟子
Only the school's students remained.

117
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,910
客人為何此時前來
Why have you come at such a time?

118
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,140
你是何人
Who are you?

119
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,350
在下趙國易縣人
I'm from Yi County in the Kingdom of Zhao.

120
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,880
先父臨終留下遺願
My father's dying wish

121
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,020
求貴館一副墨寶
was for one of your scrolls.

122
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,660
今日  我書館已是最後一日了
I fear this may be our school's last day.

123
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,730
客人求何人之字
Which calligrapher do you seek?

124
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,660
求高山先生
I respectfully request Master Highcliff.

125
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,300
高山先生  便是殘劍
Highcliff was Broken Sword

126
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,130
傳說他由書法中悟出
Legend said his skill as a swordsman

127
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,640
一套劍法  威力無比
was rooted in his calligraphy.

128
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,840
臣對此頗有顧慮
So I had my concerns.

129
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,380
所以臣想先看殘劍的書法
I needed to find out if it was true.

130
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,280
求何字
What do you want written?

131
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,650
劍
"Sword."

132
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,720
客人是愛劍之人
You are fond of the sword?

133
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,240
在下只是完成先父的遺願
It was my father's dying wish.

134
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,650
幾尺
What size scroll?

135
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,810
八尺
Eight feet.

136
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:14,030
八尺劍字  需要硃砂
For that size I will need red ink.

137
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,590
有客人求字
My master has asked me

138
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,070
主人特向小姐借硃砂一用
to borrow some red ink.

139
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,800
主人向小姐借硃砂
My master wants to borrow some red ink.

140
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,350
不知小姐聽清了沒有
Did you hear me, Master Springbrook?

141
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,250
主人向小姐借硃砂
Master Highcliff wants to borrow red ink.

142
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,830
叫他自己過來
Tell him to come himself.

143
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,480
弟子來借硃砂
Could I have some red ink?

144
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,950
臣求的劍字  還沒有寫成
The character "sword" was still being written

145
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,790
大王攻趙的軍隊
when Your Majesty's troops

146
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,020
此時已到陘城城外了
arrived at the city gates.

147
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,890
射
Draw!

148
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,030
大王軍隊  之所以百戰百勝
Your Majesty's army is invincible,

149
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,670
除能征善戰外
not only because it is brave,

150
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,780
便在於弓強箭快
but also because of its archery

151
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,880
六國的箭都不及秦箭射得遠
with a greater range than any other army.

152
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,880
大王軍隊每到一處  必例行放箭
The Qin archers are like artillery

153
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,530
試探敵情  威懾四方
intimidating the enemy.

154
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,810
風  風  風
Hail! hail! hail!

155
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,200
你們記住
Please remember

156
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,260
秦國的箭再強
their arrows might destroy our town

157
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:44,240
可以破我們的城  滅我們的國
and topple our Kingdom,

158
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,150
可亡不了趙國的字
but they can never obliterate our culture.

159
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,850
今日
Today,

160
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,560
你們要學到趙國文字的精義
you will learn the essence of our culture.

161
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,870
風  風  風
Hail! hail! hail!

162
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,360
那些趙人  當真不動
Those Zhao people didn't flee?

163
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,560
趙國書法  剛烈過人
They drew strength from their calligraphy.

164
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,390
你所求劍字  有何難寫
What was so difficult about "sword"?

165
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:55,230
劍的寫法  通常有一十九種
There are 19 different ways to write it.

166
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,910
臣向殘劍所求
I asked Broken Sword

167
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,010
是除去十九種變化的第二十種
for a 20th way.

168
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,270
書法劍術
Both calligraphy and swordplay

169
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,850
都靠手腕之力與胸中之氣
rely on one's strength and spirit.

170
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,070
這第二十種
The 20th style would reveal

171
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,350
便有他劍術的精妙藏於字中
the essence of his swordsmanship.

172
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,560
一個字  竟有十九種寫法
How odd to write it in 19 ways.

173
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,490
又互不相認
It makes the written language

174
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,290
極為不便
impossible to comprehend.

175
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,070
等寡人滅了六國之後
Once I've conquered the six Kingdoms

176
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,740
再滅其它諸國
and all the northern tribes,

177
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,470
必將這些雜七雜八的文字
I will eradicate this problem,

178
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,800
統統廢掉
by mandating one style of writing.

179
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,450
只留一種  豈不痛快
Wouldn't that be ideal?

180
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,740
大王不是只滅六國嗎
Your Majesty won't stop at the six Kingdoms?

181
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,750
六國算什麼
The six Kingdoms are nothing!

182
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,650
寡人要率大秦的鐵騎
I will lead my army to conquer vast lands

183
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,790
打下一個大大的疆土
and establish a great empire.

184
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:44,370
風  風  風
Hail! hail! hail!

185
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,280
是流水先生
Master Springbrook.

186
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:26,880
為何離開
Why are you going outside?

187
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,520
我去擋箭
To fend off the arrows.

188
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,920
不用你去  退下
You aren't needed. Stay inside.

189
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,430
秦軍箭陣  聞名天下
The Qin archers are powerful.

190
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,600
流水先生未必能擋
You alone may not stop them.

191
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:11,950
風  風  風
Hail! hail! hail!

192
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,160
好身手
You are good.

193
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,100
流水先生更是好身手
You are even better.

194
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,040
你不為求字而來
You didn't come here for calligraphy.

195
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,810
你是誰
Who are you?

196
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:18,710
在下特地送一件東西請先生過目
I've travelled here to deliver an item.

197
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,650
子夜藏書閣
Please meet me in the library at midnight.

198
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,320
好字
Great calligraphy.

199
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,820
好劍法
Great swordplay.

200
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,360
先生並未看我出劍
You didn't even see my swordplay.

201
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,300
若無你的劍  也無此字
I couldn't have written without it.

202
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,700
今夜子時
At midnight

203
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,070
請先生去藏書閣看一件東西
meet me in the library.

204
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,450
大王幾十萬大軍
Several hundred thousand Qin troops

205
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,210
當晚在山下安營紮寨準備攻趙
were readying for the next onslaught.

206
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,730
臣則連夜悟字
I studied the character all night,

207
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,730
想找出殘劍劍法之走勢
trying to unlock the secret of his skills.

208
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,470
你說這字中有劍法
It would reveal his swordsmanship?

209
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,420
可在寡人看來  這只是普通之字
But it's just an ordinary word.

210
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,620
書法劍術  境界相通
Calligraphy and swordplay are similar

211
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,660
奧妙全靠領悟
One must comprehend their true essence.

212
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,860
你領悟到了
Did you discover it?

213
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,430
尚未悟透
It eluded me.

214
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:30,640
悟不透  你如何挑戰他們
So how did you challenge them?

215
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,710
臣探之  殘劍與飛雪雖三年無話
Although they hadn't spoken in three years They spied on each other.

216
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,400
但每晚子時
At midnight

217
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,880
殘劍都會窺看飛雪
Broken Sword would peek into Flying Snow's room.

218
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,130
而到了丑時
At 2 o'clock in the morning,

219
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:49,560
飛雪同樣悄悄窺視殘劍
she would spy on Broken Sword.

220
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,400
二人行為如此怪異
What strange behaviour.

221
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:03,150
是  臣也驚訝二人關係如此奇怪
I was surprised too.

222
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:07,120
特地送去銀槍  以求利用
So I used Sky's silver spear to get to them.

223
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,130
長空是敗在你的劍下
Sky died by your sword?

224
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,340
是
Yes.

225
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,070
你是何人  為何來此
Who are you? Why are you here?

226
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,950
在下實為秦人
I'm from the Kingdom of Qin.

227
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,950
替長空帶來一句話
I have a message from Sky.

228
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,320
講
Go on.

229
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,480
長空說
he said he had lived a life

230
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,520
他此生縱橫江湖  無牽無掛
without responsibilities or commitments,

231
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,660
唯有一人常留心中
he cared for only one person.

232
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:38,860
誰
Who?

233
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,290
飛雪
Flying Snow.

234
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,550
長空說  飛雪定會替他報仇
Sky was certain she'd avenge his death.

235
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,300
若要同在下一戰  明日秦軍大營
To fight, meet me at the Qin camp.

236
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:31,480
你走
You can leave now.

237
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,190
走吧
Go!

238
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,240
我知道你看見了
I know you saw us!

239
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,810
我告訴你
Let me tell you,

240
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,320
我跟她這樣已經三年了
we've been together for three years.

241
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,930
我故意讓你看見的
I let you see us on purpose!

242
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,600
我心裏根本沒有你
I no longer care about you at all!

243
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,670
你我都很蠢
We were both very foolish.

244
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,720
我只是要你對我好一點
I just wanted you to care about me.

245
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,710
我不跟你動手
I'm not going to fight you.

246
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:42,910
走
Go away!

247
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:51,460
我要殺了你  為主人報仇
I will kill you in honor of my master!

248
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,040
你既然找死  我成全你
You ask to die. I will help you.

249
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:26,880
你笑什麼
Why do you laugh?

250
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:31,350
我笑你昨晚做了蠢事
What you did last night was stupid.

251
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:17,810
飛雪與臣決戰時
My plan proved successful.

252
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:20,040
因臣的計謀已然奏效
When Flying Snow was fighting me,

253
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:23,180
所以她氣血攻心  方寸大亂
she was disturbed and disoriented.

254
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,520
臣嬴得絲毫不費力氣
I defeated her easily.

255
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,610
想不到殘劍飛雪
I never imagined supreme warriors

256
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,580
竟如此怪異
like Broken Sword and Flying Snow

257
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,580
也會被情所困
allowing their emotions to be a liability.

258
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:07,010
寡人聽來  此戰你嬴在二人不和上
It sounds as if you did divide them.

259
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:08,140
是
Yes.

260
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,680
之所以不和
In that case, they must have been

261
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,850
二人必是心胸狹小之輩
petty and narrow-minded.

262
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,010
是
True.

263
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:16,950
你講的故事倒也合情合理
Your story sounds logical.

264
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,220
可寡人看來
But,

265
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:21,330
你把一個人想簡單了
you have underestimated one person.

266
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:23,560
誰
Who?

267
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:25,500
我
Me.

268
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:29,870
你想不想知  寡人對他們印象如何
Would you like my impression of them?

269
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,440
三年前  寡人曾與他們有過一戰
Three years ago they stormed the palace.

270
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:35,710
在寡人看來
I was impressed

271
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,310
這二人光明磊落氣度不凡
by their valor and dignity.

272
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,320
絕非小人之輩
Their character could not be petty.

273
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:43,590
所以  一夜之情是假
So Flying Snow's affair with Sky is a lie.

274
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,390
反目成仇是假
Their betrayal of one another is a lie.

275
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:48,570
你所講故事更是假
The story you just told is a lie!

276
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:55,040
只有一件事是真
Except for one thing,

277
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:59,980
長空認識你們其中一人
Sky did know one of you.

278
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:01,170
誰
Who?

279
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:03,680
你
You.

280
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:07,750
寡人猜測  你與長空早就相識
I surmise you two were old friends.

281
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:12,330
長空敗給你  只有一個理由
And Sky's defeat has only one explanation.

282
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:13,520
什麼理由
What's that?

283
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,030
故意求敗
He permitted it.

284
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,940
你與長空為行刺寡人  暗自串通
To kill me, the two of you formed a pact,

285
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,050
引我秦宮高手在一旁觀看作證
using my men as witnesses.

286
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,310
布此圈套  並不困難
That was not hard to arrange.

287
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,790
難在長空竟能將莫大信任
The hardest part was to persuade Sky

288
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,290
托付給你
to put his life in your hands.

289
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:39,290
你的劍雖快  未必能勝得了長空
You were not fast enough to defeat Sky,

290
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,230
但長空卻自願倒在你的劍下
he died willingly under your sword.

291
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,800
如此胸懷  令人嘆服
Such devotion deserves true respect.

292
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:46,570
所以長空是你的
He was the first to sacrifice himself

293
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,640
第一位捐助者
for your mission.

294
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,540
寡人在想  長空心高氣傲
Sky was proud,

295
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:55,450
自認天下無敵
he saw himself as an unrivalled fighter.

296
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:58,350
他何以認定  他做不到的事情
What convinced him you could succeed

297
00:46:58,530 --> 00:46:59,990
唯你能成功
where he had failed?

298
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:05,160
莫非你專為行刺  而十年練劍
You have trained, perhaps for 10 years

299
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,600
你的劍術中藏有一式
with one goal, my assassination.

300
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,400
威力巨大  無人能比
You have a great skill that few can counter.

301
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:24,420
得到長空  你已能上殿二十步
Killing Sky got you within 20 paces of me.

302
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:27,390
為何還尋找殘劍  飛雪
So why seek out Broken Sword and Flying Snow?

303
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:30,830
寡人猜想  你所練行刺劍法
I surmise that your skill

304
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,970
一定以十步為距
requires you to come within 10 paces.

305
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:37,030
所以  你還需利用寡人的懸賞令
You needed a second sacrifice

306
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:38,900
尋找第二名捐助者
to claim another reward

307
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,640
再進十步
to bring you within 10 paces.

308
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,050
寡人以為  殘劍飛雪
Although Broken Sword and Flying Snow

309
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:47,120
雖與長空素昧平生
had never met Sky,

310
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:48,380
但立即明白了
they instantly understood

311
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:51,030
長空故意求敗的理由
the reason for his defeat.

312
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,340
此處距書簡幾步
How far am I from the bookshelves?

313
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,040
大約十步
About 10 paces.

314
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:11,320
好  就是十步
10 paces is fine.

315
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:57,680
在下只需一人相助
I need one of you to help me.

316
00:48:58,050 --> 00:48:59,510
兩位請自行決定
Please decide between yourselves.

317
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,380
明晨  秦軍大營
Meet me at the Qin camp tomorrow morning.

318
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,500
好快的劍
How swift thy sword!

319
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:19,240
是
True.

320
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:21,140
長空是當今大俠
Sky was a superior warrior,

321
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,210
竟能將性命交與此人
he willingly gave his life to this man,

322
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,280
所以他能夠刺秦
he can kill the King.

323
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:32,980
我們要去
We must proceed.

324
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:36,830
去  就是死
That means we will die.

325
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,170
死就一起死
Then we die together.

326
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:02,170
我比你晚了一步
You were one step ahead of me.

327
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:25,070
我怕把你傷得太重了
Did I hurt you too much?

328
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:27,800
應該是我去
I should be the one who fights him.

329
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,810
我要你活下去
I want you to live.

330
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,880
你死了  我怎麼活
If you died, how could I live?

331
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:41,880
你答應我  要好好的活
You will live on, promise me.

332
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,370
你說啊
Say it!

333
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:04,450
好
All right.

334
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,230
如月快要到了
Moon is on her way,

335
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:20,740
我先走了
I had better go.

336
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,270
在下狼孟縣亭長無名
I am Nameless, Prefect of Leng Meng County.

337
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:08,070
捉拿趙國刺客到此  懇請單獨一戰
Please allow me to fight this assassin.

338
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,250
此人是大王通緝的要犯
She is on his Majesty's most wanted list.

339
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:13,290
既在此地現身  我當就地擒拿
Now she's here, I will arrest her.

340
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,580
在下與刺客曾有言在先
The assassin and I have an agreement

341
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:17,490
要單獨決一勝負
to fight one on one.

342
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,730
如在下不能取勝
Should I be unable to defeat her,

343
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,230
再有勞將軍援手相助
please apprehend her.

344
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:23,100
望將軍恩准
Your permission is sought.

345
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,690
出你的劍
Draw your sword!

346
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:51,140
風  風  風
Hail! hail! hail!

347
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:53,210
快動手
Make your move!

348
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,990
風  風  風
Hail! hail! hail!

349
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:01,620
為刺秦我死而無憾
I die willingly.

350
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,120
請動手吧
Make your move.

351
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:10,430
大風  大風  大風
Hail! hail! hail!

352
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,070
大風  大風  大風
Hail! hail! hail!

353
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:20,570
大風  大風  大風
Hail! hail! hail!

354
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:32,160
大風  大風  大風
Hail! hail! hail!

355
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,600
好快的劍
How swift thy sword!

356
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:37,840
你已拿了飛雪劍  為何還來
What are you here for?

357
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:41,010
你曾說過一句話
For what you once said.

358
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:45,450
是  誰傷飛雪  我必出劍
"I will fight the one who harms Flying Snow."

359
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:48,350
請出劍
Please draw your sword.

360
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,000
多謝
Thank you.

361
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,140
寡人以為  你與殘劍之間也曾有一戰
I believe you and Broken Sword also fought,

362
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,600
你們二人的交手絕非生死之戰
but rather it was.

363
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:15,100
而是以此種方式祭奠飛雪
A fight to honor Flying Snow.

364
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:28,310
主人交你此劍
My master wishes you to have his sword.

365
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,300
為何交劍
Why?

366
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,540
殘劍飛雪  生死相守
He and she are bound in life and death.

367
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:41,950
人不離人  劍不離劍
They will never part, nor will their swords.

368
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:53,900
主人給你此劍
It is his dying wish

369
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:55,740
助你一同刺秦
that you take his sword for your mission.

370
01:04:32,590 --> 01:04:34,060
長空  飛雪  殘劍
Sky, Flying Snow and Broken Sword

371
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:36,690
分別以不同方式捐出自己
sacrificed themselves,

372
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:39,330
助你上殿十步來刺寡人
so you can be within 10 paces of me.

373
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:42,050
此三人能把生命托付給你
All three gave you their lives.

374
01:04:42,270 --> 01:04:45,330
人生知己  也莫過於此了
The best of friends could not give more.

375
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,270
所以  你才是
Therefore you are

376
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,910
最危險的刺客
the most dangerous assassin of all.

377
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:03,760
大王何以識破
How did you uncover my plan?

378
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,030
寡人面前的燭火
The flames of these candles

379
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,400
感到了你的殺氣
are disturbed by your murderous intent.

380
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,840
他們三人  還有你
All of you

381
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:20,350
捨身取義
are willing to die for a cause.

382
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:24,580
寡人自愧不如
I'm ashamed to say I am not that committed.

383
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:26,780
大王畢竟識破了
Your Majesty has seen through our plan.

384
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:31,290
寡人也是剛剛識破
If I had realised this sooner,

385
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:36,130
否則怎會容你近我十步
I wouldn't have allowed you so close

386
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:39,700
秦人不會刺我
A citizen of Qin would not do this.

387
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:41,030
你到底是誰
Who are you?

388
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,870
臣實為趙人
A man of Zhao.

389
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:46,740
臣家人被秦軍所殺
Your Qin soldiers killed my family,

390
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,320
自幼流落在秦
I wandered into Qin

391
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:49,980
被秦人收養
and was adopted.

392
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:51,850
十年前知道身世
I discovered my real identity 10 years ago

393
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:54,160
便決心行刺
and set my heart on this plan.

394
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,460
為趙而來
You've come to avenge Zhao.

395
01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:01,060
寡人明白了
I see.

396
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:03,570
寡人想知道
I would like to know

397
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:06,140
你練的快劍名稱
if your special skill has a name.

398
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:07,770
如大王所猜
As Your Majesty guessed,

399
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:09,610
藏有一式
there is only one crucial move.

400
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:10,850
哪一式
What is that?

401
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:12,850
十步一殺
"Death within 10 Paces."

402
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:16,210
十步一殺  好名字
"Death within 10 Paces." A good name!

403
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,050
寡人的衛士
All my guards are 100 paces away

404
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:20,520
均在殿外的百步之遙
outside the palace.

405
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:22,860
而你近寡人已十步
You are within 10 paces.

406
01:06:23,930 --> 01:06:24,920
看來
It would seem

407
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:29,030
寡人今日是難逃此劫
that today I am doomed.

408
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,380
你的殺氣在亂
But I sense your hesitation.

409
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,440
大王見識過人
Your Majesty is perceptive.

410
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:43,260
可是
However,

411
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:46,660
大王也把一個人想簡單了
you too have underestimated someone.

412
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:48,560
誰
Who?

413
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,160
殘劍
Broken Sword.

414
01:06:57,610 --> 01:06:59,080
臣要向他們證明
I needed to prove to them

415
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,610
臣的劍不僅快  且精準無誤
that my sword was fast and accurate.

416
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,040
在下所練快劍
Within 10 paces,

417
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:52,310
十步之內  絕無偏差
my sword strikes with surgical precision.

418
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,950
若從膈腧穴入  步廊穴出
If it enters at precise pressure points,

419
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:58,140
便能不傷臟器  令人傷而不死
it will not cause any fatal injury.

420
01:07:58,790 --> 01:08:00,550
只求兩位中任何一位
If one of you would take a blow

421
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:04,320
能當眾受我一劍  騙過秦王耳目
before witnesses, we can fool the King.

422
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:09,400
當眾受你一劍  豈是兒戲
Such a blow is hardly child's play.

423
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,470
長空現在如何
How is Sky now?

424
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:13,130
現已無妨
Fully recovered.

425
01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:15,740
難得他對你的劍法如此信任
His trust in your sword was extraordinary.

426
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,270
秦王防範嚴密  無法接近
The King's security is impenetrable.

427
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:20,210
只能如此
There was no other way.

428
01:08:20,650 --> 01:08:23,050
那些秦宮衛士  不值一提
His lmperial Guards were useless.

429
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:26,990
其實三年前秦王就該死了
He should have died three years ago.

430
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:28,230
何以失手
What went wrong?

431
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,560
是我放棄了
I abandoned the plan.

432
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,340
秦王不能殺
The King must not be killed.

433
01:08:39,810 --> 01:08:41,240
殘劍這樣講
He said that?

434
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:42,000
是
Yes.

435
01:08:42,210 --> 01:08:43,200
為何
Why?

436
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:44,810
臣也這樣問他
I also asked him.

437
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:46,170
他如何作答
What did he say?

438
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:48,410
當日殘劍不願細說
He would not explain that day.

439
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:52,420
長空  飛雪  殘劍
Broken Sword is the strongest of the three,

440
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:56,890
三人中唯有殘劍的劍法與臣不相上下
he and I are probably equal in skills.

441
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:02,260
因此殘劍後來對臣說的話
What he told me later

442
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,010
使臣頗有顧慮
greatly unsettled me.

443
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:07,540
有我在
While I'm alive,

444
01:09:08,050 --> 01:09:09,640
便要阻止你刺秦
I'll stop you assassinating the King.

445
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:13,950
我願助你
I will help you.

446
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:18,860
三年前  有人錯失良機
He let the opportunity go by.

447
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:22,200
這次  一定要成功
This time, we must succeed.

448
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:24,760
明早  秦軍大營見
See you tomorrow at the Qin camp.

449
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:32,970
你幫我一件事
Please do me a favor.

450
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:35,910
出劍助我
Help me fight Broken Sword!

451
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:48,490
主人
Master!

452
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:56,170
還不出劍
What are you waiting for?

453
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,240
臣雖答應飛雪出劍相助
Although I had agreed to help her

454
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:03,340
但總以為有失正大光明
attack from behind is dishonorable,

455
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:05,180
故遲遲不能出手
so I couldn't draw my sword.

456
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:07,880
然而臣與飛雪都明白
But we both knew

457
01:10:08,190 --> 01:10:09,780
如不阻擋殘劍
if we did not stop Broken Sword,

458
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,390
便絕無成功可能
we would never succeed.

459
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:05,160
如月住手
Moon, don't!

460
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:09,440
你不是他對手  住手吧
You're no match for him. Stop.

461
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:35,260
我知道你會這樣做
I knew this would happen.

462
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:39,000
這樣你就不能攔我了
You can't stop me now.

463
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:42,070
就算傷我  我還會阻攔
Even wounded, I will still stop you.

464
01:12:44,050 --> 01:12:45,480
那我會殺了你
Then I will kill you!

465
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,180
我怕把他傷得太重了
Did I hurt him too much?

466
01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:57,440
有小姐的創傷藥
Your special medicine

467
01:12:57,950 --> 01:13:00,440
一日後應無大礙
should heal his wounds in a day.

468
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:02,620
藥送了嗎
have you delivered it?

469
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:05,700
是我親手替先生敷上的
I tended to the wound myself.

470
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:09,200
今天戰後  你捧飛雪劍
After the battle, take my sword

471
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,870
跟來人進秦宮
and follow Nameless to see the King.

472
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:12,240
是
Yes.

473
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:14,740
秦國不會為難你這個下人
They won't treat a servant harshly.

474
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,510
如刺秦成功
If the assassination succeeds,

475
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:19,880
打紅旗回來
wave a red flag on your return.

476
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,880
失敗了  黃旗
If it fails, a yellow one.

477
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:25,350
小姐此戰若有不幸
If something happens to you,

478
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,080
報信何用
any message will be useless.

479
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:31,960
那我在天之靈
I will smile from heaven

480
01:13:32,330 --> 01:13:34,270
見紅旗也會含笑
if I see a red flag.

481
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:40,110
飛雪如何
How is Flying Snow?

482
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:41,710
正在養息
She is resting.

483
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:47,860
我是背著她而來
She doesn't know I've come.

484
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:50,860
你曾說過  有你在便會阻擋
You said you'd stop me.

485
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:52,900
請你放棄刺秦
Please abandon the mission.

486
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:54,600
你可知我是趙人
You know I am a man of Zhao.

487
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:55,940
我也是
So am I.

488
01:14:56,370 --> 01:14:57,840
秦國是否要滅趙
Doesn't Qin want to conquer Zhao?

489
01:14:58,280 --> 01:14:59,240
是
Yes.

490
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:01,310
秦王是否趙國的敵人
Isn't the King the enemy of Zhao?

491
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:02,650
是
Yes.

492
01:15:03,450 --> 01:15:04,780
那你在替誰說話
Who are you trying to defend?

493
01:15:05,150 --> 01:15:06,480
你如何配做趙人
You call yourself a man of Zhao?

494
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:14,690
你的話  飛雪也曾經這樣問我
Flying Snow has asked me that too.

495
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:19,410
那年我浪跡江湖
When we first met,

496
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,140
碰到飛雪
I was living a carefree life.

497
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:30,890
那一戰  使我愛上飛雪
I fell in love with her after our first fight.

498
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:34,060
飛雪是趙國大將趙震之女
She's the daughter of a Zhao general

499
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,800
秦趙之戰中  趙震身亡
who died in battle against Qin.

500
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,830
傳下飛雪劍給她
She inherited his sword.

501
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:41,570
我知道飛雪立志刺秦
I knew she would avenge her father.

502
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:44,540
為父報仇  便有心幫她
I promised to help her.

503
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:48,950
書法劍術  同源同理
Calligraphy and swordplay

504
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,550
我和飛雪每日習字
share the same principles.

505
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,120
想從書法中悟出一套劍法
We did calligraphy to inspire our swordplay

506
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:55,390
增進功力
and to heighten our powers.

507
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:59,690
飛雪知道  我從小浪跡江湖
She knew I'd drifted since childhood,

508
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:02,770
四海為家  便常對我說
calling no place home.

509
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,300
等完成刺秦心願
Once we'd killed the King, she said

510
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:07,530
就帶我回她的家  她說
she would take me to her home.

511
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:10,570
那裏沒有劍  也沒有劍客
There'd be no more swordsmen,

512
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:12,170
只有一個男人
only a man

513
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:13,440
和一個女人
and a woman.

514
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:44,320
書法之真諦  在於意境
The essence of calligraphy is from the soul.

515
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:46,020
劍法也如此
Swordsmanship is the same.

516
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,920
講求返樸歸真之境界
Both aspire to truth and simplicity.

517
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:51,560
於是我慢慢領悟了
Gradually I recognised a greater cause.

518
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:00,640
三年前  劍法練成
Three years ago we perfected our skills.

519
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:02,940
飛雪執意要去刺秦
Flying Snow insisted on going ahead.

520
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:05,910
我便隨飛雪一同殺入秦宮
Together, we stormed the palace.

521
01:21:44,050 --> 01:21:46,850
飛雪問我  為何不殺秦王
She asked why I had abandoned the mission.

522
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,910
我告訴她  秦王不能殺
I told her the King must not be killed.

523
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:53,290
這是我從書法的境界中悟出的道理
That is what calligraphy taught me.

524
01:21:54,730 --> 01:21:55,990
我沒有殺秦王
I didn't kill the King.

525
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,490
飛雪從此不再理我
After that she refused to talk to me.

526
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:06,270
請你放棄
Please abandon your plan.

527
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:07,440
不
No.

528
01:22:07,650 --> 01:22:10,010
你的劍莫非只為仇恨而練
Was your sword forged in hatred?

529
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:11,370
不錯
Yes.

530
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:13,710
我的劍
For 10 years, it has never tired.

531
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:17,450
十年來不敢有一刻倦怠
I can't stop now.

532
01:22:17,690 --> 01:22:19,250
你如何才肯聽
How can I dissuade you?

533
01:22:19,790 --> 01:22:21,090
除非你殺了我
Only by killing me.

534
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:22,920
你一定要去
Are you that determined?

535
01:22:23,670 --> 01:22:24,630
是
Yes.

536
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:27,730
那好
Allow me to convey my conviction

537
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:30,700
我送你兩個字
in three words.

538
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,360
字同我心
These words express my mind.

539
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:18,800
望你三思
Please consider.

540
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:30,900
如月  把劍交給無名大俠
Moon, give my sword to Master Nameless.

541
01:23:31,290 --> 01:23:33,190
我跟飛雪人不離人
Flying Snow and I will never part

542
01:23:33,290 --> 01:23:34,700
劍不離劍
nor will our swords.

543
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:50,700
無名大俠
Master Nameless,

544
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
如月雖身份卑微
although I am just a humble servant,

545
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,520
也願為主人一勸
allow me to say a few words.

546
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:59,420
如月身為丫環  八歲跟了主人
I've been with my master since I was eight,

547
01:23:59,890 --> 01:24:01,660
隨主人研習武藝
he taught me martial arts,

548
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:03,860
更懂得做人的道理
and how to be a decent person.

549
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,300
主人做的事
Whatever my master does

550
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:07,800
一定不會錯
is for a good reason.

551
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:10,900
主人給你寫的字
The words he has given you

552
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:13,400
一定有道理
carry a deep meaning.

553
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:21,350
如月只能為主人做最後一件事了
This will be the last thing I can do for my master.

554
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:26,900
無名大俠  請你記住主人這兩個字
Master Nameless, please take his advice.

555
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:41,000
為何如此
Why did you want to do that?

556
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:43,010
我聽主人講過一個故事
I wanted to follow the example of my master,

557
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:45,910
如月願效仿古人  以死相勸
and to persuade you with my life.

558
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:48,550
你還小  生命可貴
You're still young. Life is precious.

559
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:51,450
死  要死得其所
If you must die you should die for a greater cause.

560
01:24:56,330 --> 01:24:57,490
你去吧
Be on your way.

561
01:24:57,730 --> 01:25:00,260
該記住的  我會記住
I will remember what should be remembered.

562
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:20,880
殘劍給你寫了哪兩個字
What were the words he wrote?

563
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:22,560
天下
"All under heaven."

564
01:25:22,730 --> 01:25:24,600
天下
All under heaven...

565
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:25,960
殘劍說
Broken Sword said,

566
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:29,670
七國連年混戰  百姓受苦
"The people have suffered years of warfare.

567
01:25:29,970 --> 01:25:32,270
唯有大王才能停止戰亂
"Only the King of Qin can stop the chaos

568
01:25:32,610 --> 01:25:34,580
一統天下
"by uniting all under heaven."

569
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:39,020
殘劍希望我  為了天下
He asked me to abandon the assassination

570
01:25:39,850 --> 01:25:41,510
放棄刺殺大王
for the greater good of all.

571
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:44,580
他跟我說  一個人的痛苦
He said, one person's suffering is nothing

572
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:48,090
與天下人比  便不再是痛苦
compared to the suffering of many.

573
01:25:49,170 --> 01:25:50,890
趙國與秦國的仇恨
The rivalry of Zhao and Qin is trivial

574
01:25:51,330 --> 01:25:54,830
放到天下  也不再是仇恨
compared to the greater cause.

575
01:25:59,410 --> 01:26:01,380
沒想到最瞭解寡人的
The person who really understands me

576
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:04,180
竟是寡人通緝的刺客
is my most feared enemy.

577
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:11,450
寡人孤獨一人
Alone, I have endured so much criticism.

578
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:15,360
忍受多少責難  多少暗算
So many attempts on my life.

579
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:18,000
無人能懂寡人之心
No one understands my intentions.

580
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:20,570
就連秦國的滿朝文武
Even my court officials

581
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:24,280
也視寡人為暴君
see me as a tyrant.

582
01:26:26,910 --> 01:26:29,880
想不到殘劍
But I never imagined

583
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:32,180
與寡人素昧平生
that Broken Sword, my arch-enemy

584
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:34,890
才真正懂得寡人
would truly understand,

585
01:26:36,290 --> 01:26:39,260
與寡人心意相通
and appreciate my real motives.

586
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:52,540
寡人想知道
I would like to know,

587
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:56,320
你手無寸鐵  如何刺我
how you mean to kill me without your sword?

588
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:58,090
奪劍
By capturing yours!

589
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:13,950
此劍隨寡人征戰南北
This sword has protected me

590
01:27:14,150 --> 01:27:15,580
也有十年了
through all my battles.

591
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:19,580
寡人能有殘劍大俠這樣的知己
Having found a true confidant in Broken Sword,

592
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:22,620
便是死  也足矣
if I die, I am content with my life.

593
01:27:24,430 --> 01:27:26,020
你就為天下
Let "All under heaven"

594
01:27:27,530 --> 01:27:29,560
決定這一劍吧
guide your decision.

595
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:36,900
寡人悟到了
It's just dawned on me!

596
01:29:37,450 --> 01:29:38,650
殘劍的這幅字
This scroll of Broken Sword's

597
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:40,900
根本就不含劍法招式
isn't about sword technique,

598
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,600
寫的是劍法的最高境界
but about swordsmanship's ultimate ideal.

599
01:29:43,940 --> 01:29:47,100
劍法  其第一層境界
Swordsmanship's first achievement

600
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:48,700
講求人劍合一
is the unity of man and sword.

601
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,900
劍就是人  人就是劍
Once this unity is attained

602
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,500
手中寸草  也是利器
even a blade of grass can be a weapon.

603
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:55,090
其第二層境界
The second achievement is when

604
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:59,200
講求手中無劍  劍在心中
the sword exists in one's heart

605
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:01,900
雖赤手空拳  卻能以劍氣
when absent from one's hand One can strike an enemy at 100 paces,

606
01:30:01,970 --> 01:30:04,300
殺敵於百步之外
even with bare hands.

607
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:07,000
而劍法的最高境界
Swordsmanship's ultimate achievement

608
01:30:07,310 --> 01:30:11,410
則是手中無劍  心中也無劍
is the absence of the sword in both hand and heart.

609
01:30:11,610 --> 01:30:12,880
是以大胸懷
The swordsman is at peace

610
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:14,360
包容一切
with the rest of the world,

611
01:30:15,850 --> 01:30:17,650
那便是不殺
he vows not to kill

612
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:20,000
便是和平
and to bring peace to mankind.

613
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:50,730
大王  這一劍臣必須刺
Your Majesty, your visions have convinced me

614
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:55,240
刺了這一劍
that you are committed to the highest ideal

615
01:30:56,220 --> 01:30:57,680
很多人都會死
of ultimate swordsmanship.

616
01:30:59,590 --> 01:31:01,210
而大王會活著
Therefore I cannot kill you.

617
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:07,190
死去的人  請大王記住
Remember those who gave their lives

618
01:31:08,430 --> 01:31:10,360
那最高的境界
for the highest ideal: peace.

619
01:33:49,050 --> 01:33:50,720
無名已近秦王十步
No more killing Nameless went within 10 paces of the King,

620
01:33:51,990 --> 01:33:54,120
他的劍是不會失手的
he could not have missed.

621
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,790
所以  只有一個解釋
There is only one explanation,

622
01:33:58,170 --> 01:33:59,790
是他自己願意放棄
he must have abandoned the mission.

623
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,340
你到底跟他說了什麼
What did you say to him?

624
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:05,340
我只寫了兩個字
I wrote three words.

625
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:07,130
哪兩個字
What words?

626
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:09,410
天下
"All under heaven."

627
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:14,080
你心裏只有天下
That is all you care about!

628
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:15,180
還有你
And you.

629
01:34:17,430 --> 01:34:18,360
我不信
I don't believe you.

630
01:34:18,630 --> 01:34:19,890
如何讓你信
How can I convince you?

631
01:34:28,610 --> 01:34:29,570
拔劍
Draw your sword.

632
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:33,340
你害了無名
You've misled Nameless.

633
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:36,370
害了長空  害了趙國
You've ruined Sky and the Kingdom of Zhao.

634
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:37,780
拔劍
Draw!

635
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:43,550
當初我們相識的時候
When we first met...

636
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:46,960
你也要我拔劍
I had to prove myself to convince you.

637
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:51,630
你如何才信
What can I do this time?

638
01:34:52,070 --> 01:34:53,660
我只要你拔劍
Just draw your sword!

639
01:36:20,790 --> 01:36:22,310
你為什麼不擋我的劍
Why didn't you fend off my sword?

640
01:36:23,790 --> 01:36:25,260
這樣你就信了
So that you'd believe me.

641
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,460
我一直都想跟你回家
I always wanted to go home with you.

642
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:42,550
可惜不能去了
Sadly, it won't happen now.

643
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:49,240
你一個人好好保重
Take good care of yourself.

644
01:37:03,410 --> 01:37:04,970
你為什麼不擋我的劍
Why didn't you defend yourself?

645
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:15,550
為什麼不擋
Why didn't you defend yourself?

646
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:28,270
為什麼不擋
Why didn't you?

647
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:42,540
我們再不會浪跡江湖了
No more drifting, no more roaming.

648
01:38:49,130 --> 01:38:51,090
我現在就帶你回家
I'm taking you home now.

649
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:55,200
回我們的家
Our home.

650
01:40:10,180 --> 01:40:11,740
大王  殺不殺
Your Majesty, permission to execute?

651
01:40:11,950 --> 01:40:15,010
大王  殺不殺  殺不殺
Permission to execute?

652
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:17,450
大王  殺不殺
Your Majesty, permission to execute?

653
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:20,920
大王  殺不殺  殺不殺
Permission to execute?

654
01:40:40,790 --> 01:40:43,780
居心叵測  大膽行刺
He conspired to assassinate Your Majesty.

655
01:40:43,990 --> 01:40:45,320
殺無赦
Show no mercy!

656
01:40:45,490 --> 01:40:49,060
這是大王制定的秦國大法
This is the law of Qin!

657
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:53,800
大王要得天下
To conquer all under heaven,

658
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,060
一定要令行禁止
the law must be enforced.

659
01:40:56,310 --> 01:40:58,870
給世人一個榜樣
Set an example for the world!

660
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:03,440
大王  殺  大王  殺
Execute him! Execute him!

661
01:41:03,650 --> 01:41:05,050
大王  殺
Execute him!

662
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:10,760
大王  殺  大王  殺
Execute him! Execute him!

663
01:41:10,930 --> 01:41:12,420
大王  殺
Execute him!

664
01:41:22,070 --> 01:41:23,040
殺
Execute him!

665
01:42:44,550 --> 01:42:48,450
大風  大風  大風
Hail! hail! hail!

666
01:42:51,890 --> 01:43:03,270
大風  大風  大風
Hail! hail! hail!

667
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:50,700
公元前二二一年  秦王終於征服所有六國  統一中國
{\an8}In 221 B.C., the King of Qin conquered all six kingdoms and unified China.

668
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:56,800
他停止了征伐  並修建萬里長城  用以保護本國臣民免受北方族裔侵擾
{\an8}He ceased all expeditions and built the Great Wall to protect his subjects from the Northern Tribes.

669
01:43:56,900 --> 01:44:01,900
秦王朝成為了中國第一個王朝
{\an8}The Qin Empire became the first dynasty of China...

670
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:07,000
秦始皇則是中國歷史上第一位皇帝
{\an8}And Qin Shihuang... the First Emperor.
