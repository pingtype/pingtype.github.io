432
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,240
推動這件事  幫他們發聲

433
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:54,480
薩羅

I want to run hotels, so I put all the profits into my pocket.

435
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:02,070
先說說你來自哪里吧  好嗎 
Well, let's start with where you are from? Shall we?

436
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:03,410
你出生在澳大利亞嗎

加爾各答

00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:09,460
我有家人在加爾各答  我的表親們特別糟糕
I've got family in Calcutta. My cousins are quite bad.

440
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:10,490

441
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:14,220
我是被領養的  我不算是印度人
I'm adopted. I'm not really Indian.

442
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,900
但是你喜歡板球  對吧
But you like cricket though, right?

443
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:22,190
你喜歡板球啊
Ah, you like cricket...

444
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:25,040
你支持澳洲隊還是印度隊
You go for the Aussies or the Indians?

445
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,080
只支持澳洲隊
Only the Aussies, mate!

446
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:29,510
只支持澳洲隊
Only the Aussies, mate!

447
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,390
這就有意思了
This is going to be interesting.

448
00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:32,950
好了  薩羅
Okay, Saroo...

449
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,180
你為什么選這門課
Why did you choose this course?

450
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:37,210
你還希望從中獲得什么
What else do you want to get out of it?

451
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:25,130
-你好  -你好

452
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:25,800

00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:33,780
嗨  你好嗎
Hi, how are you?

456
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:36,270
你們喜歡吃印度菜嗎
Do you guys like Indian food?

457
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,260
只準備了印度菜  只有這些
That's all we have. That's all we have.

458
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:43,520
-聞起來好香啊  -我試著學別人...
- It smells so great. - I tried to copy someone...

459
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:47,750
你有沒有跳過寶萊塢舞蹈

- Lampo de poche. - Flashlight is er...

464
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:04,210
你們怎么叫
What do you say?

465
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:05,280
電筒
Torch.

466
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,730
如果你想用手抓著吃
If you want to eat with your hands,

467
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:09,720
就要用馕盛著  像勺子一樣
you need to use the naan, like a spoon.

01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:11,650
-用叉子吧  -不  讓他用馕
- Use a fork. - No, let him use the naan.

470
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,390
-的士  -的士
- Taxi. - Taxi.

471
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,540
這個詞在所有語言里都一樣
It is the same in every language.

472
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:18,880
你想用叉子嗎  薩羅
Do you want a fork, Saroo?

473
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,900
好啊
Yeah!

474
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:22,870
他像我父親一樣

01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,520
-你要不要再來一瓶啤酒  -要  謝謝

476
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:53,150

你好啊
Hello...

478
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,650
你沒事吧
You okay?

479
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:32,360
薩羅
Saroo?

480
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,540
我并不是來自加爾各答
I'm not from Calcutta.

481
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:44,790
我迷路了
I'm lost.

482
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:48,930
豪拉火車站很大  你當時一定嚇壞了
Howrah station is enormous, you must have been freaking out.

483
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:51,530
有一次我去布里朝圣  經過那里
I once went through there on a pilgrimage to Puri,

484
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,480
結果我兩次沒趕上火車
and I missed my connection twice.

485
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:55,610
你那時候不會說孟加拉語嗎
And you didn't speak Bengali?

486
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:58,060
我當時連那種語言叫什么都不知道
I didn't even know it was called that.

487
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:01,560
-你在火車上待了多長時間  -好幾天吧
- How long were you on the train? - A couple of days.

488
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:03,010
好幾天嗎
A couple of days?

489
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,020
薩羅  你的家鄉在哪里來著
Saroo, what was your hometown again?

490
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,060
甘尼斯塔萊
Ganestlay.

491
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,350
我一定是記錯了  因為沒有這個地方
I must have had it wrong because it doesn't exist.

492
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:14,660
但你一定還記得別的線索吧
But there must be something else that you do remember.

493
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:19,700
那個站臺
The platform...

494
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:23,440
我睡著的地方  有一個很大的雨水收集箱
I fell asleep on, there's a big rain tank.

495
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:26,030
那里離甘尼斯塔萊只有幾站路
It was only a few stops from Ganestlay.

496
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,730
成千上萬的火車站都有雨水收集箱
There are thousands of stations with rain tanks.

497
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:31,360
好吧  這是很久以前的事了
Okay, it was a long time ago.

498
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,460
你有沒有聽說過一個新項目  叫谷歌地球
Have you heard of this new program, Google Earth?

499
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:36,630
它很神奇  可以幫你找到世界上任何一個地方
It's incredible, you can find any place from anywhere.

500
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:38,150
聽我說  我們可以查出
Listen to me, we can find

501
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:40,880
當時客運列車的時速是多少
out how fast passenger trains went back then.

502
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:42,360
我們用那個時速
We take that speed,

503
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,820
乘以你坐火車的小時數
multiply by the hours that you were on the train.

504
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:45,940
就成了
That's it!

505
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:47,820
我們能得出搜索半徑
We create a search radius.

506
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:50,590
然后在這范圍內  找出那個有雨水收集箱的車站
And inside there, you will find the station with the rain tank.

507
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:51,800
沒錯  可是搜索印度
Yeah, but it will take a

508
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,020
所有的火車站  要花上一輩子的時間
lifetime to search all the stations in India.

509
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:56,230
我有說所有的火車站嗎
Did I say all the stations?

510
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:57,420
好吧  哪怕只找一半
Ok, even half the stations.

511
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,460
各位  我真的不想談論這件事
Really guys, I don't want to talk about this.

512
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:03,430
你的父母有找過你嗎
Did your parents try to find you?

513
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:05,460
-怎么了  -他們當然找過他
- What? - They tried to find him.

514
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:06,720
不  我的意思是
No I just mean like,

515
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:09,760
如果他們找過你  可能會留下書面線索
if they tried to find him, maybe they left like a paper trail.

516
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,000
什么書面線索
What paper trail?

517
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:13,490
-他連自己姓什么都不知道  -我媽不識字
- He didn't know his surname. - My mum couldn't read or write.

518
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:15,960
她做什么工作的
What does she do?

519
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,190
勞工  她抬石塊的
A labourer, she carried rocks.

520
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,240
你媽媽嗎
Your mum?

521
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:28,830
我媽大約四年前去世了
My mom died about four years ago now.

522
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:30,600
我很遺憾
I'm sorry.

523
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:33,870
我爸爸還是很生她的氣
My dad is still so angry at her.

524
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,570
當然不是因為她病了
Not for getting sick, obviously...

525
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:38,450
而是因為她不肯做化療
but just for refusing chemo.

526
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:44,210
但她很了解自己  清楚自己想要的生活方式
But she just knew herself, you know? She knew what her terms were

527
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:46,550
以及如何度過余下的時間  所以...
and she knew how she wanted to live, so...

528
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:50,670
大概就是無法接受吧
Just couldn't accept that, I guess.

529
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:55,910
那你又是什么感覺
And how do you feel?

530
01:03:57,150 --> 01:03:58,740
我很想她
I just miss her.

531
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,810
你覺得巴拉特關于搜索半徑那個提議怎么樣
And what do you think of Bharat's search radius idea?

532
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:14,980
那是什么意思
What was that?

533
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:20,780
這是你的舞步嗎  你是這樣跳舞的嗎
Is that your dance? Is that how you dance?

534
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:22,350
天啊
Oh, God!

535
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,930
{\an8}客運列車速度

536
01:06:55,780 --> 01:07:00,870

537
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:28,820
你不能再這樣下去了
You can't keep going on like this.

538
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:32,850
讓我來幫你
Let me help you.

539
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,170
我們去跑步吧
Let's go for a run.

540
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,320
什么
What?

541
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:50,600

等一下
Hold on.

544
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:03,500
抽筋了
Got a cramp.

545
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:08,370
你騙我  你作弊
You lied! You cheat.

546
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:15,170
我從來沒給別人看過這個
I never show anybody this.

547
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:17,170
為什么  很美啊
Why? They're beautiful.

548
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:21,580
我真的很喜歡畫畫  這是我的小愛好
I do enjoy it. My little hobby.

549
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:25,240
看看曼塔希啊
Oh wow, look at Mantosh!

550
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:27,660
他今晚會來  我真的很高興
I'm so glad he's coming tonight.

551
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,390
狂妄無禮的小東西
Cheeky little thing.

552
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:31,690
精力十足
Pure energy.

553
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:34,890
但是很了不起
But incredible.

554
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,200
真有愛
So sweet!

555
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:40,130
他一向難以控制  可是
He's been hard to control, but...

556
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:44,060
卻非常聰明
very, very smart... and very...

557
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:48,500
只要他能學會控制自己  他做什么都能成功
I mean, he could do anything if he just learned to control that energy.

558
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:50,040
他任何事情都能做到
He could do it, and do it all.

559
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:53,140
薩羅對他的保護欲很強
Saroo is very protective of him.

560
01:09:57,940 --> 01:09:59,050
我很幸運
I've been blessed.

561
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:04,920
非常幸運
Very blessed.

562
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:09,690
你媽媽給我看了你以前那些獎杯
Your mom showed me all your old little trophies.

563
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:11,820
媽媽  你不是吧
Mum, you didn't.

564
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:15,760
我都不知道你以前那么喜歡運動
I didn't know you were so athletic.

565
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:18,470
那些只是一半而已  還有很多在車庫里
That's only half of them. There's plenty more in the garage.

566
01:10:19,170 --> 01:10:20,530
你去哪兒  伙計
Hey, where you going, mate?

567
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:22,570
把煙抽完
Finishing my smoke.

568
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:24,480
現在我想讓他離開沙發
I can barely get him off...

569
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,440
-都很難  -露西
- ...the couch these days. - Lucy!

570
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:33,220
你為什么就不能告訴他們
Why can't you just tell them...

571
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:35,670
-你最近在干什么  -不要說
- what you've been up to? - Don't!

572
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:37,720
告訴我們
Tell us.

573
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:40,350
他們會理解和支持你
They will understand and they will support you.

574
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:42,690
什么事  快說吧
What? Come on.

575
01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:44,660
嘿  吃晚餐了
Hey, um, dinner!

576
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,290
趕快趁熱吃吧
Better eat it, while it's hot.

577
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,460
-你餓了嗎  -是的
- You hungry? - Yeah.

578
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:55,270
怎么了
What?

579
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:58,660
我錯過了什么
What have I missed?

580
01:10:58,870 --> 01:10:59,870
沒什么
Nothing.

581
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:02,610
-她看起來不高興  -她沒有不高興
- She looks upset. - She's not upset!

582
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:03,910
你又不知道我的感受
You don't know how I feel.

583
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:07,990
薩羅無所不知
Saroo knows everything.

584
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,880
他可是專家
He's an expert.

585
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,120
他是個經理
He's a manager.

586
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:16,080
你為什么來這里
Why are you here?

587
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:19,540
因為他是你的兄弟
He's here because he's your brother.

588
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:20,880
不  他不是
No, he's not.

589
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,770
-我們不一樣  -住口  薩羅
- We're different. - Hey, now now, Saroo!

590
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:31,940
薩羅
Saroo...

591
01:11:39,310 --> 01:11:40,310
好了
All right.

592
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,120
沒事的
It's all right.

593
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:49,890
別這樣
Hey hey, no no...

594
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:56,330
沒事了  沒事了  停下
It's all right, It's all right... Stop!

595
01:11:57,630 --> 01:11:58,880
不要動
Don't move.

596
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,640
沒事了
It's okay.

597
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:03,800
干得好啊
Nice one, mate.

598
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:10,930
沒事了  沒事了  深呼吸  深呼吸
It's okay mate, It's okay, just breathe, mate. Just breathe...

599
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:20,920
我恨他對你造成的傷害
I hate what he's done to you.

600
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,120
對不起
I'm sorry.

601
01:13:14,110 --> 01:13:15,440
薩羅
Saroo!

602
01:13:17,210 --> 01:13:18,280
薩羅
Saroo.

603
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:21,580
薩羅
Saroo!

604
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:32,290
吻我
Kiss me.

605
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:38,880
別這樣  求你了
Stop, please.

606
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:40,770
看著我
Look at me.

607
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:44,880
看著我
Look at me!

608
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:46,800
-晚點再談  行嗎  -你魂不守舍的
- Can this wait? - Where are you?

609
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:49,000
能不能等我們回家再談
Can this wait 'til we get home?

610
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:50,950
-行嗎  -家
- Yah? - Home?

611
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,340
什么家
What home?

612
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:56,180
你是指我獨自待在一個房間
You mean, where I'm alone

613
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:58,180
你獨自待在另一個房間的那個地方嗎
in one room and you're alone in another room?

614
01:14:58,380 --> 01:14:59,380
來啊
Come on.

615
01:15:00,210 --> 01:15:01,810
別這樣  露西
Stop, Luce. Stop it.

616
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:04,150
來啊
Come on.

617
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:05,720
求你了
Please.

618
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:09,920
薩羅
Saroo!

619
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:12,260
你必須面對現實
You need to face reality!

620
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:15,480
你說的現實是什么意思
What do you mean? Reality?

621
01:15:17,130 --> 01:15:21,450
你能想象我的心情嗎  知道自己親哥哥
You have any idea what it's like knowing my real brother...

622
01:15:21,690 --> 01:15:24,890
和母親每一天都在找我
and mother spend everyday of their lives looking for me?

623
01:15:27,390 --> 01:15:30,190
我的親哥哥每天怎樣呼喊著我的名字
How every day my real brother screams my name!

624
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:33,510
你能想象
Can you imagine the pain

625
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:36,200
他們不知道我的下落的痛苦嗎
they must be in for not knowing where I am?

626
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:39,720
25年  露西  25年了
25 years, Luce. 25!

627
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:43,670
你為什么不告訴我這些心結
Why didn't you tell me that's was happening for you?

628
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:47,710
我們在優越的生活中  放縱享受著
And we swung about in our privileged lives.

629
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:51,750
那讓我覺得惡心
It makes me sick.

630
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,180
我必須找到家
I have to find home.

631
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,450
他們必須知道  好嗎
They need to know, okay?

632
01:15:56,950 --> 01:15:58,460
我從未阻攔過你
I've never stopped you.

633
01:15:58,990 --> 01:16:00,160
我想幫忙
I want to help.

634
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:01,730
我不能再這樣下去了
I can't do this anymore.

635
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:03,960
你值得更好的
You deserve more.

636
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:05,860
別這樣
Don't you do that!

637
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,500
你不能這樣  這都是你錯  可不怪我
Don't you dare do that! This is on you, not on me.

638
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:17,200
薩羅  你在嗎  伙計
Saroo, you there, mate?

639
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:21,230
明天是單日國際板球賽
It's One Day International tomorrow.

640
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:22,700
你想來的話就來吧
You can come over if you like?

641
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,830
我是想告訴你  我修好了船柄
I meant to tell you, I fixed the tiller.

642
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:30,540
我們為什么不帶它出去  我們可以開去海岸
Why don't we take her out? We can head up the coast?

643
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:36,010
嘿  薩羅
Hey, Saroo...

644
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:38,640
伙計  你媽媽她不...
Mate, your mum's not, um,

645
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:42,780
聽著  我們找不到曼塔希  他又失蹤了
look, we've lost track of Mantosh, he's missing again.

646
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:45,550
你知道她有多擔心
You know how worried she gets.

647
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:56,130
我們知道你辭了工作  伙計
We know you quit your job, mate.

648
01:19:57,590 --> 01:19:59,060
我們很擔心你  兒子
Just worried about you, son.

649
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:42,740
我最近時不時就去看看它
I've been visiting her.

650
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:48,320
每天晚上我順著那些街道走回家
Every night I walk those streets home.

651
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:50,980
從壩上走回家
Home from the dam.

652
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,250
從車站走回家
Home from the station.

653
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:56,350
我現在知道了...
I know now...

654
01:20:57,860 --> 01:20:59,420
路上走的每一步
...every single step of the way.

655
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:03,530
我想象著...
And I imagine that I'm...

656
01:21:06,030 --> 01:21:07,560
我在它耳旁輕語
...whispering in her ear...

657
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,270
我在這  沒事了
I'm here, it's alright.

658
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,200
她是什么樣的
What was she like?

659
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:17,410
很美
Beautiful.

660
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:24,210
紐約怎么樣
How was New York?

661
01:21:24,950 --> 01:21:25,950
都一樣
It's the same.

662
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:29,350
所以  你為什么回來了
So, what brings you back?

663
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:32,620
我拿到經費了
My funding came through.

664
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:34,920
太棒了
It's great!

665
01:21:35,230 --> 01:21:36,230
看吧
See...

666
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:38,230
他們知道你有多棒
They know how good you are.

667
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:52,340
我很想你
I miss you.

668
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:56,310
我見到你媽媽了
I saw your mom.

669
01:21:57,850 --> 01:21:59,880
她不是很好
She's not doing very well.

670
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:04,010
我擔心  如果我告訴她我在找家她會崩潰的
I'm worried, it would kill her if she knew I was searching.

671
01:22:04,890 --> 01:22:06,220
你低估她了
You underestimate her.

672
01:22:07,190 --> 01:22:08,190
她需要你
She needs you.

673
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:22,820
不  給我5盧比  我把這些都搬走
No, give me five rupees then I'll carry them all

674
01:22:22,870 --> 01:22:26,910
好吧  你贏了  拿著吧
Okay, you win, take this

675
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:38,130
他當時搬著西瓜  沒看到車過來
He was carrying a watermelon and didn't see it coming

676
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:00,210
怎么了
What?

677
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:05,250
如果你找到了家  他們卻都不在了怎么辦
What if you do find home and they're not even there?

678
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:10,850
你還會不停地去搜尋嗎
And you never stop and keep searching?

679
01:23:13,190 --> 01:23:15,180
你不知道過了這么久發生了什么
And you don't know what happens over time,

680
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:19,300
世事變遷  整個世界都在變
things change, and entire worlds change.

681
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:22,000
我別無選擇
I don't have a choice.

682
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:38,080
留下來
Stay.

683
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:44,850
我不能
I can't.

684
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,350
站在那別過來
Stay right there

685
01:24:09,770 --> 01:24:11,660
你不是應該照顧好他的嗎
Weren't you supposed to look after him?

686
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,110
你去哪了
Where were you?

687
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:15,950
你不愛他了嗎
Don't you love him?

688
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:42,790
約翰和曼塔希乘船出去了
John heard Mantosh is out on the boats.

689
01:24:48,630 --> 01:24:50,090
去抓龍蝦了
Doing a lobster run.

690
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:58,840
他明天回來
He's due back tomorrow.

691
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:06,140
所以他會賺很多的現金  又要整天喝酒了
So he'll be flushed with cash, back on the hard stuff.

692
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:13,790
我很抱歉你不能有自己的孩子
I'm sorry you couldn't have your own kids.

693
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:18,320
你說什么
What are you saying?

694
01:25:18,390 --> 01:25:19,390
我們
We...

695
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,320
我們
We...

696
01:25:23,530 --> 01:25:25,330
并不是白紙一張
weren't blank pages, were we?

697
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,770
像你親生的孩子那樣
Like your own would have been.

698
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:33,070
你領養的不只是我們  也領回了我們的過去
You weren't just adopting us but our past as well.

699
01:25:35,810 --> 01:25:39,410
-我感覺我們在害死你  -我可以生孩子的
- I feel like, we're killing you. - I could have had kids.

700
01:25:42,610 --> 01:25:43,610
什么
What?

701
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:45,150
我們選擇不生孩子
We chose not to have kids.

702
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,290
我們想要你們兩個
We wanted the two of you.

703
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:52,230
那才是我們想要的
That's what we wanted.

704
01:25:53,190 --> 01:25:56,810
我們想要你們兩個出現在我們的生活里
We wanted the two of you in our lives.

705
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:58,470
那是我們的選擇
That's what we chose.

706
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:09,420
那也是我愛上你爸爸的原因之一
That's one of the reasons, I fell in love with your dad.

707
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:12,480
因為我們都覺得
Because we both felt, as if...

708
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:16,180
這世界上的人已經夠多了
... the world has enough people in it.

709
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:22,990
生個孩子  并不保證任何事會變得更美好
Have a child, couldn't guarantee it will make anything better.

710
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:26,170
但是接受一個像你們這樣處于困境的孩子
But to take a child that's suffering like you boys were.

711
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:30,630
給你們一個機會
Give you a chance in the world.

712
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:34,230
那意義非凡
That's something.

713
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:37,230
我猜你們從來沒想過會有這么困難
I bet you never imagined it being this hard.

714
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,300
這并不是困難的問題
It's not a matter of hard.

715
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:41,110
這不是...
It's not a mat...

716
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:47,780
我只有這一條路可以走
There's only one path for me.

717
01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:49,880
我是這么想的
And, that's how I think.

718
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:53,520
之所以會這樣是因為...
That's how this happened because...

719
01:26:56,850 --> 01:26:58,360
在我歲12的時候
When I was 12,

720
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,360
我看到過一個幻象
I had a vision.

721
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:11,640
有些人會說那是精神崩潰  但是...
Some people would say, it was a breakdown. But it...

722
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:18,210
我父親是個酒鬼  你知道的  就好像
My dad was an alcoholic. You know that, and he was like

723
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:20,430
他不是一個好人
he wasn't a good man.

724
01:27:20,430 --> 01:27:24,180
他那時失去了理智
He was out of control when I was...

725
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:28,600
而我當時站在屋后
I was standing at the back of the house.

726
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,390
我眺望著田野
I was looking out across this field.

727
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,930
希望這世界將我吞沒
And I just wanted the earth to swallow me up.

728
01:27:38,030 --> 01:27:39,130
我...
And I...

729
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:48,870
我感受到一股電流  像是被電了一下
I felt an electric current, it was like a shock,

730
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,010
好像我渾身上下都在震顫
like a jolt through my whole body.

731
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:53,310
后來我看見...
And then I saw...

732
01:27:53,710 --> 01:27:55,210
一個棕色皮膚的孩子
a brown skinned child

733
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:57,180
穿過田野
across that field.

734
01:28:02,790 --> 01:28:04,660
他站在我的身邊
And he was standing beside me.

735
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:09,550
就在那里  我很強烈地感覺到了
And it was right there and I could feel it so strongly.

736
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:16,000
我人生中第一次感受到了美好的東西
And for the first time in my life I felt something good...

737
01:28:16,470 --> 01:28:19,380
我感覺很愉快
I felt good.

738
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:24,180
我知道那是在指引我
And I knew it was guiding me.

739
01:28:24,310 --> 01:28:27,210
我知道我會沒事的
And I knew that I was going to be fine.

740
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:34,780
那一刻我仿佛看到了我的未來  就在眼前
It was, as if, that moment I could see my future, right there!

741
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:40,190
因為我一直以為我可以把這個家聚在一起
Because I always thought that I could keep this family together.

742
01:28:41,230 --> 01:28:42,230
現在...
And now...

743
01:28:43,330 --> 01:28:44,630
現在我也不知道了
Now I don't know.

Where...

745
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:49,730
-媽媽  -這是怎么回事  我不明白
- Mum... - What's happening? I don't understand.

746
01:28:54,910 --> 01:28:57,010
你再也不跟我談心了
You don't talk to me any more.
