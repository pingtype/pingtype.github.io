1
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,150
在很長一段時間里 大家都知道
For as long as can be remembered, storks delivered babies

2
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,150
寶寶都是送子鳥送來的
from their perch on Stork Mountain.

3
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,190
這曾經是一種榮耀的象征
It was an honor and a privilege to serve.

4
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,980
這是我們的職責 我們核心的信仰
It was our duty, our core belief,

5
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,910
是我們血液中流淌的血脈
the driving force of our very lifeblood.

7
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,630
并不是總是一帆風順的
It wasn't always easy.

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,760
這是我們的挑戰
This was our challenge.

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,750
這是我們神圣的職責
This was our sacred duty.

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,150
無論多么的艱難或不可能
No matter how tough or impossible

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,550
或殘酷 嚴厲 不人道和野蠻
or brutal or harsh or inhumane or savage,

13
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,990
我們都將戰勝逆境
we would triumph over adversity.

15
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,550
抓到你了！
Gotcha!

18
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,810
- 在你的右邊   - 左邊
- On your right.  - Left.

19
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,840
自行車車道
Bike lane.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,510
謝天謝地 我們不用再也做那個了
Thank goodness we don't do that anymore.

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,380
那里！ 就在那里！
There! Right there!

22
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,350
問題是
The problem was,

23
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,910
我們在遞送不同的東西
we had the wrong cargo.

24
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,350
我們的新手機！
Our new phones!

25
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,590
幸運的是 現在 送子鳥們在給角落商店公司送包裹
Luckily, now, storks deliver packages for Cornerstore. com!

26
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,870
我的伙計 
My dude!

27
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,870
凱文! 看起來不錯啊 朋友！
Yo, Kevron! Lookin' good, my man!

28
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,880
天啊  我超喜歡這家伙！
Oh, I love this guy!

29
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,190
完美著陸 進行檢查
Perfect landing. Chiggy-check.

30
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,400
你是那個人！
You're the man!

31
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,400
什么？ 第一百萬份包裹？ 不可能
What? Millionth package? Not possible.

32
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,190
我想我才20歲
I thought I was only at 20.

33
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,840
朱尼爾 你要去慶祝一下嗎？
Hey, Junior, are you gonna celebrate?

34
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,220
你知道什么？ 你是對的 我的確要慶祝一下
You know what? You're right. I should celebrate.

35
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,690
你們這個周末都要什么？
What are you guys doing this weekend?

36
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,720
你們有空嗎？
Are you guys free?

37
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,910
我和我的妻子都在慶祝另一個紀念日
The wife and I are celebrating another anniversary.

38
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,710
給我的孩子取名
Got my kid's game this weekend.

39
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,510
家庭團聚 我們全家都會來
Family reunion. The whole family's coming.

40
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,950
噢 我只是想確認一下
Oh. Just wanted to confirm.

41
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,160
那么你們都很忙啊
That you were all busy.

42
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,920
我以為你們都很忙 還有你也是
I assumed you were all busy and you are.

43
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,330
那么 如果有要改變主意的 請讓我知道
So, if anything changes, let me know.

44
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,490
我可能要出門工作
I maybe could get out of work.

45
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,090
可能不可以 但是如果你可以的話請讓我知道
Probably can't, but let me know if you can.

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,270
那里的工作真不錯  大兄弟
Great job out there, brah!

47
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,990
謝謝  馬屁鴿
Thanks, Pigeon Toady.

48
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,000
看看我的女朋友
Check out my girlfriend.

49
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,600
- 她在加拿大  - 是啊 呵呵
- She's in Canada.  - Yeah-huh.

50
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
她移民了
She migrated.

51
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,430
- 她可不是編的  - 好吧
- She's not made up.  Okay.

52
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,390
快看她！ 快看她！
Look at her! Look at her!

53
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,630
- 她是真實的  - 太好了！
- She exists, brah! - That's great.

54
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,070
你們聽說過羅杰嗎？
Hey, did you guys hear about Roger?

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,910
天吶 你還好嗎？
Oh, my goodness. Are you okay?

57
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,310
什么？  我說...什么？ 好吧
What? Hey, brah. I say... What? Okay.

58
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,110
我可以和你說說我的女朋友嗎？
I tell you about my girlfriend?

59
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,590
老板想要見你
Hey, boss wants to see you.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,710
亨特想要見我？
Hunter wants to see me?

62
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,670
好了 認真點 朱尼爾
All right. Head in the game, Junior.

63
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,670
所以 你是亨特 你在這里做什么？
So, you're Hunter. What do you do around here?

64
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,040
不 我討厭那樣
No, I hate that.

65
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,790
亨特 很高興 見到 你
Hunter. Nice. To. Meet. You.

66
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,990
不 那太呆了
No, that's too robot.

67
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,160
正常說話 正常說話 讓我們開始吧
Just say it normal. Just say it normal. Here we go.

68
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,380
很高興見到你！
Nice to meet you!

69
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,240
我是怎么了？
What is wrong with me?

70
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
朱尼爾
Junior.

71
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,230
亨特
Hunter.

72
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,920
你知道為什么我完全用玻璃打造我的辦公室
You know why I built my office entirely out of glass

73
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,630
即使鳥兒是看不到玻璃嗎？
even though birds can't see glass?

74
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,430
我不知道
I do not.

75
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,910
那我告訴你吧
Power move.

76
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,830
18年以前 為了拯救所以送子鳥 我宣布了
Eighteen years ago, I saved all storks by getting out of babies

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,230
取消了遞送寶寶的業務
and into package delivery.

78
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,470
現在 這個星期一，在大會上
Now, this Monday at Storkcon,

79
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,870
董事會宣布把我升職
the board will announce they're kicking me upstairs.

80
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,280
我將要準備任命做主席
I'm going to be named Chairman.

81
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,990
而這就意味你將被任命
Which means you are going to be named

82
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,390
老板
boss.

83
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,790
老板！
Boss!

84
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,410
酷 酷 酷！ 非常酷 非常酷
Cool, cool, cool. Very cool, very cool.

85
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,190
現在 睜大眼睛看看你的周圍
Now, look upon your domain with your eyes wide open.

86
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,240
很大
Wider.

87
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,350
我太喜歡了 這感覺很棒
I love it. Feels good.

88
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,870
如果你不能看見它 你是怎么當上老板的
How can you be boss if you can't look at it?

89
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,230
如果我瞎了 這就不值得了
If I go blind, it was worth it.

90
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,090
你知道作為一個老板最艱難的事是什么嗎？
You know the hardest thing about bein' boss?

91
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,180
凝望太陽？
Staring at the sun?

92
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
不 這很簡單
No, this is easy.

93
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,800
是否做一個像朋友的老板 或冷漠的老板 再或是古怪的老板
Whether to be like a friend boss or a distant, weird boss?

94
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,970
總是板著一副冷漠古怪的臉 你怎么了？
Always be distant and weird. What's the matter with you?

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
對不起
Sorry.

96
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,230
不 是 處理她
No, it's dealing with that.

97
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,710
那個孤兒小郁？
The orphan Tulip?

98
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,020
我不明白
I don't understand.

99
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,150
你知道為什么我們要停止遞送嬰兒嗎？
Do you know why we stopped delivering babies?

100
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,520
因為有很多其他得到寶寶的方式？
Because there are so many other ways of getting babies?

101
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,830
是的 但這不是全部
Yes. But that's not the whole story.

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,990
18年前 當我們仍在遞送人類嬰兒時
Eighteen years ago, when we still delivered human infants,

103
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,220
一個名叫賈斯伯的送子鳥發瘋地嘗試養一個嬰兒
a stork named Jasper went crazy and tried to keep a baby.

104
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,710
小郁的定位器破裂了
Tulip's beacon broke.

105
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,550
她的地址被摧毀了 所以我們無法再遞送她
Her address was destroyed, so we could no longer deliver her.

106
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,510
我的寶貝！
My baby!

107
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,070
這就是之后我意識到遞送寶寶是沒有前途的
It was then I realized that there was no future in baby delivery.

108
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,310
現在 那個孤兒小郁剛到18歲 這意味我們可以解放她了
Now, the orphan Tulip has just turned 18, which means we can finally liberate her

109
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,270
讓她回到人類生活的世界
and return her to the human world.

110
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,550
但是她并不是個麻煩
But she's no trouble.

111
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,310
她不是 
Oh, she isn't, is she?

112
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,350
這是我們的利潤表
Here's our profit chart.

113
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,120
- 我喜歡有一個很好的利潤表  - 我也是
- I love a good profit chart.  - Me, too.

114
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
耶！
Yeah!

115
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,630
小郁在山上度假時睡著后得流感了
The peaks are when Tulip is on vacation, asleep or out with the flu.

116
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,510
那些山谷就是她試圖去幫助的對象
The valleys are when she tries to help.

117
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,870
我會讓她走的
Cool. I will liberate her. Consider her liberated.

118
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,190
如果她不想走呢
And if she doesn't want to be liberated?

119
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,920
解雇她 我是在說解雇她
Fire her. I'm talking about firing her.

120
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,990
真的？
Really?

121
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,010
你唯一需要去做的事是 等著在星期一升職為老板
The only thing you need to do to be named boss on Monday

122
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,230
但在此之前你要讓小郁走人
is liberate the orphan Tulip.

123
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,970
我可能沒有講清楚 我的意思是開除她！
If I'm not being clear, I mean fire her!

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,110
是 我現在就去做
Yes, sir. I am on it.

125
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,430
我查過有關你的所有信息
I have read between the lines and heard you overtly.

127
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,670
打擾一下！ 孤兒小郁？
Excuse me! Orphan Tulip?

128
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
朱尼爾？
Junior?

129
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,940
你在和我說話？
You're talkin' to me?

130
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,230
是的 孤兒小郁！
Yes, Orphan Tulip!

131
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,270
不 你不是從來都不和我說話的嗎
No, it's just that you never talk to me.

132
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,610
從今天不是了 孤兒小郁
Well, yeah, that's changing starting today, Orphan Tulip.

133
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,600
“小郁”就好了 “孤兒”太傷我心了
Oh, "Tulip" is just fine. "Orphan" hurts my heart.

134
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,390
我有好多問題要問你！
I have so many questions to ask you!

135
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,630
為什么你不下來和我一起聊聊？
Why don't you come down and we can talk all day?

136
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,550
好吧 我會下來的
Okay. I will be down.

137
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,940
和我的朋友一起
As will my friends.

138
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,460
我們準備飛下來
We are going to fly right down.

139
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
什么？不 不
What? No, no.

140
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,210
那是一只鵪鶉 一只鴯鹋 還有一只雞
That's a quail, an emu, there's a chicken.

141
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,240
它們都不會飛
They cannot fly.

142
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,670
但是 直到現在會飛了
Yeah. Until now.

143
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,130
她幫我們實現了夢想
She's helping us achieve our dreams.

144
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,750
- 對啊 道蘭  - 你知道的
- That's right, Dougland. - You know it.

145
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,520
如果你用那個桶的話那我沒話說
It is still a personal victory if you use the bucket.

146
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,110
那我們就不應那個
Okay, we'll all not use the bucket!

147
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,340
等一下 什么？
Wait, what?

148
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,590
哈哈！ 小郁還不適應
Ha-ha! Tulip doesn't fit in.

149
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,990
我們都是一樣的 唯有她是個怪人
We're all the same and she's a weirdo.

150
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,730
感覺不太好 她...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not nice. She's...

151
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,270
她有著一個艱難的人生
She's had a hard life.

152
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,670
好吧
Okay.

成功了！ 我們都在飛！
It's working! We're flying!

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,190

162
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,710

壞道蘭！ 不！
Bad Dougland! No!

169
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,190
怎么可能我的夢想發展到如此可怕的地步？

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,060

我不適合在任何我想去做的事情上
I don't fit in anywhere and all I want to do is help!

180
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,430

你被釋放了
You have been liberated.

191
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,630
什么意思？
What does that mean?

192
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,990
意思就是你被開除了
Well, it means that you are
fired.

193
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,790
- 什么？  - 你...

198
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,670
因為我剛剛炸毀了工廠
Because I just blew up most of the factory.

199
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,030

201
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,150
這意味...
Well, it means...

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,350
我要把你安排到其他適合你的崗位去
I'm putting you in charge of your very own department.

204
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,060
你是信件收發室的這個崗位的老大了
You are the new head of Letter Sorting.

I always thought it was
something more like "Strength"!

214
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,870
- “決心” - 不 開玩笑的
- "Determination"! - Nope. That's way off.

215
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,990
第一條規定是 絕不能離開這里
Number-one rule, never leave this room.

216

285
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,670
媽媽 爸爸 我已經決定我想要一個小弟弟了
Mom, Dad, I've decided I want a baby brother.

286
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,600
親愛的 你可以...  - 你可以等一下嗎？
- Oh, honey, can you...  - Can you hold one second?

288
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,580
我覺得一家三口挺不錯的
I think we're fine as a family of three.

289
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,760
為什么我不能有一個小弟弟？
Why can't I have one?

290
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,910
簡單點來說吧 你們從哪里得到我的？
Let's make this easy.  Where do you get one?

291
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,470
為什么你們一直在笑又不回答我的問題？
Why are you laughing and not answering me?

292
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,670
你們是從哪兒得到我的？
Where did you get me?

293
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
你們在笑什么？
What is the joke?

294
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,330
這是一個完全不同于我們現在正在進行的項目
Is there a different subject?

295
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,590
好吧 這輛車上現在有著超級怪異的氣氛
Okay, so there's a super weird vibe in this car right now.

296
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,910
寶貝 這太甜蜜了
Oh, honey, this is very sweet.

297
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,710
但是我們有了你
But we have you.

298
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,390
就是我們的所有
And that's all we need.

299
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,590
對
That's right.

300
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,090

Guys, thank you so much! Oh, my gosh.

320
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,170
你不覺得朱尼爾把你安置在這是為了把你逼上絕路嗎？
Don't you think Junior put you down here to get you out of the way?

321
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,250
謝莉爾 那太不公平了 你為什么那么說？
Cheryl, that's not fair. Why would you say that?

322
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,290
什么？ 我忍不住就這么說了 因為我是你直言不違的朋友啊
What? I can't help it. I'm your outspoken friend.

323
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,450
我從來沒那么做過
I've never done this before,

324
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,040
但是我勸你快離開這里

“H.I.部門”

327
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,070
沒聽說過啊
Don't know that one.

328
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,510
他說這里等我第一條規定是“不能離開這里”
He said the number-one rule is "Don't leave."

329
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,750
但是如果我不去送信 我將一事無成
But if I don't deliver the letter, I won't be doing my job.

330
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,170

除非有一大堆亂七八糟的事情
Barring any monumental screw-up.

337
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,710
你知道當你是個老板的時候我們要做什么嗎？
Do you know what we'll do when you're boss?

338

You'll never be alone because Cornerstore is your family.

344
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,690

怎么把這東西給關掉？
How do you turn this thing off?

351
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,750
打短柄墻球還有釣魚
...and racquetball and fishing...

352
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,190
為什么會有這么多屏幕？
Why are there so many screens?

353
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,670
關掉 關掉 關掉！
Turn off, turn off, turn off!

354

你將得到一切你想要的
You're about to get everything you ever wanted.

355

我就應該開除她！為什么我當時不開除她？
I should have just fired her! Why didn't I just fire her?

358
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,630

360
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,170
你在房間外面干什么？
Hey, what are you doing out of the room?

361
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,330
我不是告訴過你不準離開那間房間嗎！
I told you not to leave the room!

362
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,850
此言差矣 我在幫助我自己打掩護
Nah, it's cool. I'm covering for myself.

363
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,880
什么？
What?

364
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,350
好吧 我們得離開這里了
Okay, we need to get outta here.

365
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,110
快點 我們現在必須得走了
Come on. We have to go now.

366
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,710
朱尼爾 你告訴過我去做好這件事 我不會令你失望的！
Junior, you asked me to do a thing,
and I will not fail you!

367
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,510
用生命遞送！
Always deliver!

368
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,910
等一下！ 不！
Wait! No!

369
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,670
這是嬰兒工廠！
This is the Baby Factory!

370
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,630
這是嬰兒工廠？

Why did you do that?

374
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,390
觸地得分 小郁！

別在那慶祝了！
Stop celebrating!

376
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,230
我想這應該到那邊去的
I think it was supposed to go over there.

378
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,070
你是對的 那是個錯誤
You're right. That was wrong.

379
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,750
不要啊！
Oh, come on!

380
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,790
為什么我們不在幾年前摧毀它？
Why didn't we destroy this place years ago?

381
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,330
我的天！
Oh, my gosh!

382
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,440
我不敢相信我都看到了什么！
I can't believe what I'm seeing!

383
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,670
你看到所有的一切了嗎？
Do you see all this?

384
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,630
朱尼爾！ 那太驚奇了！
Junior! This is amazing!

385
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,780
為什么把按鈕安置在那？ 
Why put the button there? Uh...

386
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,580
來吧！
Come on!

388
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,940
這是停了嗎？
Is it off?

389
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,390
我想是的
Uh, I believe so.

390
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,630
你還好嗎？
Are you okay?

391
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,260
你的翅膀看起來有點錯位
Your wing looks a little mangled.

392
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,990
我的翅膀很好 一點事都沒有
My wing is fine. It's A-O-great.

393
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,630

Yeah, that seems bad.

394
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,020
走吧
Let's go.

395
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,070
此地不宜久留
This place is dangerous.

396
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,670
那是什么？
Huh. What is that?

397
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,590

Cool beans.

398

399
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,920
- 發生什么事了？  - 媽媽 爸爸
- What's happening? - Mom, Dad.

400
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,460
送子鳥正在給我帶來一個弟弟！
The storks are bringing me a baby brother!

401
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,750
這聽起來像是個美好的夢 伙計
That sounds like a nice dream, buddy.

402
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,990
快回去睡覺吧 親愛的

這是我有生以來最糟糕的一天了！
This is the worst day of my life!

405
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,230
亨特會殺了我的！
Hunter's gonna kill me!

406
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,490
- 為什么我們不告訴任何一個人？  -你瘋了嗎？
- Why don't we just tell someone?  - Are you insane?

407
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,360
如果有人發現這里 我就死定了
If anyone finds out about this,
I am dead meat.

408
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,190
我的老板夢也就破裂了
My hopes of becoming boss destroyed.

409

414
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,430
新品種包裹？里面是什么？
New kind of package? What's in it?

415
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,270
- 糖果盒 - 有一些氣體 
- Candy canes. - Some gas.

416
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,790
酷斃了 老兄 你昨晚看比賽了？

And yet then with a little time left, we pulled it out...

421
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
- 是啊！  - 耶！
- Totally! - Yeah.

422
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,590
只是在最后一秒再次失球
...only to lose it again in the last second.

423
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,550
- 這太令人失望了  - 這真是失落啊
- Such a disappointment. - It was a comedown.

424
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,480
- 只不過球又回來了 - 真是我生命中最棒的一天！
- Only to get it back. - Best day of my life!

425
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,130
- 然后又丟球了 ！  - 真是我生命中最糟糕的一天！
- Only to lose it! - Worst day of my life!

426
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,270
然后球又回來了
Only to get it back.

427
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,520
看來這是一個過山車比賽！
A roller-coaster of a game!

428
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,630
然后又再次失球了
Only to lose it again.

429
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,360
多么贊的比賽啊！ 我們走了  再見
What a game! Here we go, see you later.

430
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
再見！
Bye!

431
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,670
沒什么大不了的
Cool. No big deal.

432
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,710
等...等一下
Wait... Wait a second.

433
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,710
昨晚沒有比賽
There was no game last night.

434
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,230
什么...
What the...

435
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,230
來 去我的工作室
Come on. Let's get to my workshop.

436
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,950
我們在那兒會安全的
We'll be safe there.

437
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,790
好吧 好了 好了 好了
All right, okay, all right, all right.

438
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,630
這一切都不會有問題的
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

439
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,390
我們要低調  好嗎？
We just need to keep a low-pro here. Okay?

440
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,350
如果有人看到一個帶著孩子的送子鳥
If one person sees a stork with a baby,

441
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,750
我被任命做老板的機會就毀了 所以...
my chances of being named boss are ruined. So...

442
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,920
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

443
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,450
- 我想看看那個孩子！  - 不 不 不
- I wanna see the baby! - No, no, no.

444
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,520
我們不能打開那個東西
We do not open that thing.

445
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,940
只是一個露面就可以可愛到你生活不能自理
Just a brief exposure to baby cuteness can ruin your life.

446
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,120
還記得賈斯伯嗎？
Remember Jasper?

447
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,370
我正在試著把我的手指放上去那 我想不起來誰...
Hmm. I'm trying to put my finger on it. I can't think of who...

448
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,610
你正在遭受諷刺因為他改變了你的人生歷程
You're being sarcastic because he changed the course of your life.

449
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,640
- 是啊  - 對啊
- That's right. - Yeah.

450
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,440
嗯 這個怎么樣？
Huh. How about this?

451
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,030
嗯 好吧 送子鳥大會是在下個星期一 今天是星期五
Huh. All right, Storkcon is on Monday. Today is Friday.

452
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,950
如果我們把這個孩子送到她家 我仍能做上老板
If I can just deliver this thing by then, I can still be named boss.

453
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,630
加德納家 我來啦！
Gardner family, here I come!

454
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,910
但是你的翅膀折斷了 你不能...
But your wing's broken. You can't...

455
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,270
設定一個計劃！ 死守計劃！
Make a plan! Stick to the plan!

456
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,910
用生命遞送！
Always deliver!

457
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,710
我不能再飛了！
I'll never fly again!

458
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,560
那是什么？
What's that?

459
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
你說的什么是什么？
Hmm? What's what?

460
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,350
那個 就在那
That. Right there.

461
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,270
那個？ 不可以
Uh... Oh, that? No.

462
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,470
那沒什么
That's nothing.

463
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,640
看起來像架飛機
Looks like an airplane.

464
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,790
好吧 我猜應該是和飛機一類的
Well, it kind of is an airplane, I guess.

465
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,220
太好了 我來駕駛它
Great! I'll use it.

466
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,870
好吧 這要花費我很長時間去弄它
Oh, well, it kind of took me a long time to make,

467
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,070
像要幾年時間...
like years and years...

468
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,920
好了 見證奇跡的時刻到了
Great. All leading to this moment.

469
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,400
我修復它是為了其他事情
I'm saving it for something else.

470
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,520
- 為了什么？ 
- For what?

471
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,960
你打算用它做什么？
What were you gonna use it for?

472
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,630
為角落商店公司遞送包裹是我的夢想
Uh, it's my dream to deliver packages for Cornerstore.com.

473
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,150
好了 那個 孩子
Oh, well, hey there, kid.

474
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,430
現在是你的機會了
Now's your chance.

475
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,790
- 呃 我不知道  - 好吧
- Uh, I don't know.  - Yeah.

476
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,990
我甚至不知道他是否能飛
I don't even know if it flies.

478
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,150
你知道嗎？
You know what?

479
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,550
你可以使用它了 讓我們一起遞送嬰兒吧
Yeah, you can use it. Let's deliver this baby.

480
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,830
你確定嗎？
Are you sure though?

481
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,390
- 好吧 開始大干一場吧！
- All right, let's do it!

482
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,440
好吧 太棒了 讓我來教你這個怎么用
Okay, great. Let me show you how to fly this.

483
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,150
你好？ 我是一只鳥
Um, hello? I'm a bird.

484
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,870
我很確定我知道如何...
I'm pretty sure I know how to...

485
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,830
我錯了！ 我完全錯了！
I was wrong! I was immediately wrong!

486
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,310
當然 那個自動飛行按鈕讓你飛得更完美
Of course, the autopilot button. That makes perfect sense.

487
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,920
我知道 我在測試你
I knew that. I was testing you.

488
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,690
你測試了一個讓我成功做到了的事
Oh, you were testing me on a thing that I made.

489
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,450
- 那當然  - 你的座位濕嗎？
- That's correct. - Is your seat wet?

490
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,610
是的 那是我的尿
Yep. That's my urine.

491
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,430
我在下降的時候拉了點尿在座位上
I peed in the seat when we were falling.

492
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,550
你還想說些其他的什么嗎？
Whoo. What else do you want to talk about?

493
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,310
我的孩子
My baby.

494
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,350
現在 我真的覺得你會喜歡上這間房子貝基
Now, I really think you're gonna love this one, Becky.

495
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,800
我們都覺得你這次找到了 適合你的房子
I think we found you a good one.

496
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
是啊 當你看到這個房子
Yeah, when we saw this,

497
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,070
我們當時選房子的時候 就是“哇”  就是這間 的這種感覺
we looked at each other and we were like, "Wow."

498
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,550
當然我在說你們的房子
"This is theirs." Yeah.

499
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,210
- 只不過可能要裝修一下  -  是啊
- And it's a fixer-upper... - Yeah. It is.

500
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,690
我知道裝修不是你們要的
...which I know we weren't looking for.

501
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,750
但是至少它不是破爛不堪
But at least it's not a fixer-downer.

502
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,960
親愛的 你能不能...
Oh, honey, can you just...

503
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,330
- 你可不可以等一下？  - 是的 你可以嗎？
- Can you hold one second? - Yeah, can you?

504
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,370
- 你去看看  - 什么？ 不 還沒輪到我
- You're up. You're up.  - What? No, it's not my turn.

505
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,700
- 你去 馬上   - 不行啊
- You're up, now. You're up. - It can't be.

506
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,880
所以你是想我們的家被毀 對嗎
So you want a panic room, okay.

508
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,350
內特？
Nate?

509
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,920
干嘛？
What?

510
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,300
內特？
Nate?

511
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,990
在這 伙計
Hey there, buddy.

512
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,190
你在干什么？
Whatcha doin' here?

513
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,430
我正在準備
I'm preparing.

514
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,990
很好 你正在準備
Right, you're preparing.

515
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,590
準備什么？
For what?

516
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,750
迎接送子鳥送來的我的弟弟
To get my baby brother from the storks.

517
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,110
好吧
Right.

518
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,550
我喜歡你校鼓勵超越現實的想象力
Hey, I love your school encourages imagination over actual learning,

519
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,710
- 但是送子鳥已經不能再遞送寶寶了  - 我知道
- but the storks don't deliver anymore.  - I know.

520
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,210
它們從來就沒有遞送過寶寶  就像是 永遠都沒有
They haven't done that in, like, forever.

521
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,760
爸爸 你根本不需要幫助我
Dad, you don't have to help me at all.

522
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,590
我就是要讓覺得回去工作會內疚
This is a guilt-free pass for you to go back inside and work.

523
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
你走就可以了
Just go.

524
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,340
- 走 走吧 爸爸 - 什么？
- Go. Shoo, shoo, Dad. Go. - What?

525
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,990
好吧 那我走了
Okay, all right. Fine.

526
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,550
你眨眨眼我就進大學了
You blink and I'll be in college.

527
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,860
你說什么
What was that?

528
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,670
我只是一直走 一直工作
Hmm? No, I'm just walking, working.

529
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,950
- 我什么都沒說 你只需要...  - 好吧
- I didn't say anything. You should just... - Okay.

530
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,090
還記得還當我是個嬰兒的時候嗎？ 這就像一分鐘之前？
Remember when I was a baby? It felt like one minute ago?

531
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,350
- 什么？  - 什么？
- What? - What?

532
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,040
好
Fine.

533
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,090
爸爸 你就是我的偶像 不過最多兩年 以后我就不會這么覺得了
Dad, you'll be my idol for, like, two more years.

534
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,430
好吧 我聽到了
Okay, I heard that one.

535
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,310
這樣吧  聽著
Okay. All right, look.

536
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,670
五分鐘 我就只有五分鐘 然后我們就停止
Five minutes. That's all the time I have is five minutes, and then we stop.

537
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,840
好 五分鐘
Yeah, five minutes.

538
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,040
五分鐘 然后...
Five minutes, and then...

539
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,200
我們就停下來
We stop.

540
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,590
五分鐘之后我們就停止
Five minutes and then we stop.

541
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,950
什么？
What?

542
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,910
粉末？
Powder?

543
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,630
嬰兒粉
Baby powder.

544
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,110
我鴿子的味覺又回來了
Homing pigeon powers activate!

546
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,270
寶貝 我們要怎么叫你呢 寶貝？
Baby, what are we gonna call you, baby?

547
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,990
這太瘋狂了 我們正在遞送一個嬰兒！
This is crazy. We are delivering a baby!

548
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,790
不 我們正在遞送一個包裹
No, we are delivering a package.

549
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,320
可能我們應該給它取個名字而不是叫它“包裹”
Maybe we should name it instead of calling it "the package."

550
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,070
我們不給包裹起名字 好嗎？
We do not name the package, okay?

551
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,240
這很簡單
It's very simple.

552
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,430
我們制定一個計劃 就要死守計劃
We make a plan. Stick to the plan.

553
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,190
用生命遞送
Always deliver.

554
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,430
然后我們就回去 董事會就會任命我為老板了
And then we get back to Storkcon so the board can name me boss.

555
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,660
這太刺激了
Oh, it's so exciting.

556
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,830
我們可以從老板朱尼爾那得到什么期望嗎？
What can we expect from boss Junior?

557
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,330
你知道那是最高機密
Oh, you know that's top secret.

558
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,240
- 你可以告訴我的 來嘛  - 我要做的事情太大了
- You can tell me. Come on. - It's gonna be big!

559
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,330
比如說 到底有多大 你到底要干什么？
Like what? Like, what, how big? Like, what are you gonna do?

560
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,350
現在最好不再討論這件事了
I prefer not to talk about it right now.

561
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,620
- 你不知道嗎？  - 什么？
- Do you not know? - What?

562
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,970
-天吶 你不知道  - 我知道
- Oh, my gosh. You don't know.  - I know.

563
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,730
如果你不知道 那為什么你要成為一個老板？
If you don't know, then why do you wanna be boss?

564
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,790
- 我知道  - 你不知道
- I know. - You don't.

565
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,520
我覺得你笑得好假
Oh, man, you laugh when you're uncomfortable.

566
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,680
不
No.

567
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,320
- 是我按到了什么開關了嗎？  - 不是
- Am I pushing your buttons?  - Uh, no.

568
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,750
- 是的  - 不是
- Yes, I am. - Nah. No.

569
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,410
- 嗶 嗶 嗶 嗶  - 不 那些都不是我的按鈕
- Beep, beep, boop, boop... - No, those aren't even where my buttons

570
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,750
如果我有按鈕
would be if I had buttons.

571
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,250
- 嗶 嗶 咘 咘...  - 不錯的嘗試
- Beep, beep, boop, boop... - So, nice try.

572
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,770
我正在編程你要告訴我為什么你想當一個老板
I am programming you to tell me why you want to be boss.

573
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,910
我喜歡機器 所以這很有趣
I love robots, so this is fun.

574
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,370
我們有共同擁有一個美好時光
We're having a good time together.

575
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,050
你為什么想要成為一個老板？
Why do you wanna be boss? Why do you wanna be boss?

576
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,470
別說了！
Back off!

577
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,720
天啊！ 不！
Oh, God! No!

578
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,230
不
No, no, no!

579
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,830
哇！  這很有趣
Wow! Well, that was funny.

580
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,400
你差點就死了
You almost died.

581
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,030
我猜今天我們上的那堂課是別問為什么我想要成為一個老板 對嗎？
I guess the lesson we learned today is don't ask me why I want to be boss, right?

582
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,740
是啊 很好的一節課
Okay, good talk.

583
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,480
很好的一節課
Good talk.

584
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,510
那聽起來不是很高興
That didn't sound happy.

585
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,430
其實 我們很快就到了
Yeah, well, the package will be delivered soon enough.

587
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,930
我真的在想我們應該好好檢查一下那個東西 你知道
I really think that we should check that out, you know.

588
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
只要放輕松就好了
Ah, just relax.

589
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,790
好吧 你是對的
Okay. Yeah, you're right.

590
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,310
你看 包裹在自己哭著輕輕入睡
Ah, you see, the package has cried itself gently to sleep.

591
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,790
我不能接受！
I can't take it!

592
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,950
我控制不了我的身體！ 必須去打開那個包裹！
Can't help body movements! Must open pod!

593
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,230
等一下！ 不！
Wait! No!

594
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,790
包裹！ 一定要打開包裹！
The pod! Gotta open the pod!

595
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,880
別  快回來！ 回來！
Oh, no! No, no, no! Come back! Come back!

596
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,810
- 快到駕駛座那里  - 把飛機拉起來
- Be there in a jiff!  - Pull yourself together!

597
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,360
- 快回來就是飛機   -我要去打開這個包裹！
- Fly this plane!  - Gotta open the pod!

598
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,030
我們要死啦！
We're gonna die!

599
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,640
好吧 至少孩子安靜下來了
Well, at least the baby's quiet.

600
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,980
你是失去理智了嗎？
Are you out of your mind?

601
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,910
因為孩子哭你就撞毀一架飛機？
A baby cries and you crash a plane?

602
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,990
我在忙著這個包裹的事情！
Hey, hey, hey! I was busy with the pod!

603
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,990
為什么你不開啟自動駕駛？
Why didn't you turn on the autopilot?

604
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,640
我當時慌了！ 聽我說 小郁
I was panicking! Listen to me, Tulip.

605
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,050
- 你撞毀了飛機一架飛機 聽到我說的了嗎？  - 但是孩子安靜下來了
- You crashed a plane, did you hear me?  - The baby is quiet.

606
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,790
- 你撞毀了一架飛機！  - 孩子安靜了啊！
- You crashed a plane!  - The baby is quiet!

607
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,250
- 那孩子安靜了嗎？  - 是的 她安靜了！
- The baby is quiet?  - The baby is quiet!

608
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,910
- 為什么你什么不早說？  - 不！
- Why didn't you say anything? - Oh, no!

609
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,220
為什么那么安靜？
Why is it quiet?

610
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,030
打開們 打開門
Open the pod! Open the pod! Open the pod! Open the pod!

611
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,400
要怎么打開這個？ 快點！
How do you open this thing? How do you open it? Come on!

613
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,760
天吶 你知道我剛才想到了什么嗎？
Oh, my gosh. You know what I just realized?

614
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,430
這個孩子和我是同一天生日
This baby and I have the same birthday.

615
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,230
不 我才不在乎呢
Oh, yeah. I don't care.

616
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,320
你撞毀了這架飛機 我再也不需要你了
You crashed the plane. I don't need you anymore.

617
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,950
我要自己去遞送這個孩子了 再見
I'm going to deliver the package myself. Goodbye.

618
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,550
什么？ 你要叛離這個團隊嗎？
What? You're breaking up the team?

619
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,190
“團隊”？ 你有病吧？
"Team"? What is wrong with you?

620
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,270
我和你從來就不是一個團隊 我們之間你什么都沒有
You and I are not a team. We are nothing.

621
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,990
這里沒有“我們”
There is no "we."

622
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,350
這全都是你的錯 這個
This is all your fault. This.

623
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,870
這個 還有這個！
This. This!

624
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,190
全是你的錯
All of this.

625
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,950
祝你好運 孤兒小郁
A good day to you, Orphan Tulip.

626
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,390
祝你好運
A good day.

627
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,150
好吧 和往常一樣 我會很好的
Well, just so you know, I'll be fine.

628
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,870
我是信件整理部門最受歡迎的人
I'm the most popular person in the entire Letter Sorting department.

629
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,760
- 我聽不清你說的！  - 我說...
- I can't hear you! - I said that...

630
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,530
這聽起來就像口吃
Yeah, it just sounds
like "Blah, blah, blah,"

631
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,780
還混雜著哭聲
but mixed with crying.

632
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,650
但是那不是我...朱尼爾 快來這里
But that's not what I'm... Junior, come here.

633
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,050
我聽不清你在說什么 不過我知道你肯定是在狡辯
I can't hear what you're saying, but I assume it's lame.

634
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,560
我說我是最受歡迎的人...
I said I'm the most popular person...

635
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,390
別說了！
Lame!

636
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,230
小郁是個傻瓜
Tulip's dumb.

637
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,350
我有一個你不適合這份工作的原因
There's a reason she doesn't fit in.

638
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,230
如果你有建造一架飛機的本領 那么干嘛會摧毀它？
If you're smart enough to build a plane, then who wrecks one?

639
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,240
我要去遞送這個孩子 然后立刻回到山上
I'm gonna deliver this package and be back at Stork Mountain in no time.

640
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,390
太好了 我被狼群包圍了！
Oh, great. Now I'm surrounded by wolves!

641
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,120
你們準備干什么 敲暈我？
What are you gonna do, knock me unconscious?

642
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,340
完美！
Perfect!

643
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,230
這在逗我嗎？
Oh, seriously?

644
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,430
我不是在和你說話 我在生你的氣！
I'm not talking to you. I'm mad at you!

645
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,450
真的嗎？ 那我要做什么？
Oh, no. Really? What am I gonna do?

646
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,930
我們沒話聊了！ 聊天結束
We are done! This conversation is over.

647
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,960
最后一句話是我說的！
Last word, me!

648
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
- 最后一句話  - 是我說的
- Last word. - Me.

649
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,830
- 最后一句話   - 我說的 
- Last word. Last word. - Me. Me. Me.

650
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,470
聽著 我是首領
Listen, I'm the alpha.

651
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,770
我要第一個吃這個寶貝
I'm gonna eat this thing first.

652
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,150
我要做新首領
I'm gonna be the new alpha.

653
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,950
不 這里... 不需要新首領
No. There is no... There's no need for a new alpha.

654
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,160
我是首領！
I'm the alpha!

655
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,640
- 你...  - 你甚至連老二的都排不上
- You...  - You're not even a beta.

656
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,800
我是首領！
I'm the alpha!

657
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,710
不 你不是首領！
No, you're not the alpha!

659
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,680
剛剛發生什么了？
What just happened?

660
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,990
- 那是什么？  - 你剛剛做了什么？
- What was that? - What did that thing just do?

661
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,230
- 等一下  我們在干嘛  
- I'm sorry. Where were we?

662
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,110
我要吞沒這家伙
I'm gonna devour this thing.

663
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,580
我要把她的手臂咬下來
I'm gonna bite her arm clean off.

664
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,130
你沒有把她的手臂咬下來
You didn't bite her arm clean off.

665
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,630
那嘗起來像花一樣
This tastes like flowers.

666
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,230
好吧 站一邊去
Okay, stand aside.

667
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,490
看看你 看看你都干了什么
Look at you. Look what you did.

668
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,430
你做了和你一樣的事
I did the same thing you did.

669
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,640
- 你愛上她了嗎  - 我愛上她了
- Are you in love? - I am in love.

670
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,010
- 你也愛上她了  - 我也愛上她了
- Are you in love?  - I'm in love, too.

671
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,290
我同意
I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree.

672
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,710
伙計們！
Hey, guys!

673
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,110
這個小東西現在是我們狼群的新成員
This tiny thing is now a wolf, everybody.

674
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,010
- 你說什么？  - 什么？ 發生什么事了？
- What did he say?  - What? What's happening?

675
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,290
- 大聲點 我們聽不見！  - 她是我們的人了！
- Louder. We're in the back!  - We're keeping it!

676
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,520
- 在后面的 她是我們的人！  - 好 謝謝
- Back of the pack, we're keeping it! - Okay, thank you.

677
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,920
看那個
Aw, look at that.

678
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,210
這個遞送任務現在完成了
The delivery is now complete.

679
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,410
現在 我只要找到路離開這里
Now, I just need to find a way out of here.

680
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,680
等一下 你不是在遞送她到她父母那嗎？
Wait, you're not gonna deliver her to her actual parents?

681
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,220
嬰兒不知道有什么不同 因為嬰兒是傻子
Baby doesn't know the difference because babies are dumb.

682
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,550
嬰兒不是傻子
Oh, babies are not dumb.

683
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,720
他們超傻的
They are super dumb.

684
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,690
嬰兒能解決甚至我們都不理解的問題
Babies have a higher level of intelligence than we will ever understand.

685
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,330
你應該像一個嬰兒一樣學習如何說話
You sound like a baby that learned how to talk.

686
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,810
我是個嬰兒要學說話！
I am a baby that learned how to talk!

687
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,990
嘿 我想教她走一個圓
Hey, I want to teach it to walk around in circles

688
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,720
- 在她躺下之前  - 好啊 
- before it lays down.  - Yes. Yes. Yes.

689
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,890
那是我最愛教的事
That's my favorite thing to teach.

690
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,210
別靠太近 你嚇著她了！
Don't get too close, you're gonna scare it!

691
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,240
我不是...
I'm not... Ow!

693
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,860
- 嗯 這個寶寶 她在笑！  - 是啊 笑笑比較容易被接納
- Huh. The baby, it's laughing!  - Yeah. Good for it.

694
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,070
不
No.

695
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,510
好吧 我對我將要做的事感到抱歉
Okay, I apologize for what I'm about to do.

696
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,660
- 對不起
- Sorry.

698
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,230
- 停下！  - 對不起
- Stop it!  - Sorry.

699
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,350
對不起
Sorry.

700
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,110
- 那是我的臉！  - 對不起！
- That's my face!  - Sorry!

701
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,790
- 你為什么還不停下？  - 快點！
- Why did you stop?  - Come on!

702
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,990
好吧 我有一個計劃 我可以假裝
Okay, I get the plan. I can fake it. I can fake it!

703
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,630
好  那就假裝！
Okay, okay. Fake it!

705
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,170
等一下！等一下 好嗎？ 等一下
Wait! Hold on a second, okay? Wait.

706
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,750
好了 我有一個主意
All right, I have an idea.

707
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,070
你們可以想像得到 如果你把我們放下來他會用多大的力來打我
Imagine how much harder she could hit me if you cut us down.

708
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,510
太好了！ 我真的可以為這家伙痛哭
Oh, yeah! I could really wail on this guy.

709
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,100
我的意思是 你并不需要做到那樣 但是...
I mean, you don't have to go that hard, but...

710
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,110
- 我想我會的  - 好吧...
- Oh, I think I do.  - Well...

711
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,750
我還在生你的氣
Oh, I'm still mad at you.

712
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,960
切斷它！
Cut 'em down!

713
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,420
抓住一根棒子或其它也行！
Grab a stick or something!

714
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,790
等一下 什么？
Wait, what?

716
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,470
你要想更多嗎？
Do you want more?

717
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,070
是的！
Yeah!

718
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,950
這根小樹枝足夠嗎？
Will this tiny twig be enough?

719
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,830
- 是的！  - 不！ 不！
- Yes!  - No! No!

720
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
要更大的！
Bigger!

721
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,520
你可以找到最大的樹干！
Get the biggest twig you can find!

722
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,150
對不起了 朱尼爾 我只能給予它們想要的東西了
Sorry, Junior. Gotta give the people what they want.

723
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,910
抓住那個孩子！ 快！
Grab the baby! Let's go!

724
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,510
群狼聽令 抓住他們！
Wolf pack, chase!

725
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,690
抓住他們 
Chase, chase, chase.

726
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,970
為什么你不停止打我？
Why wouldn't you stop hitting me?

727
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,200
我在讓它們分心啊
I was distracting them.

728
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,350
好吧 我們快走吧
Okay, here we go.

729
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,450
我們應該砍斷這索橋！
Oh! Oh! We should untie the bridge!

730
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,160
是的 我知道 不然你以為我要干嘛？
Yeah, I know. What do you think I'm doing?

731
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,470
抓住他們
Chase, chase, chase.

732
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,510
唔啊
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

733
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,590
滾吧 臭狼們！
Suck it, wolves!

734
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,310
群狼聽令！ 開啟過橋模式！
Wolf pack! Form of wolf bridge!

736
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,710
發生什么事了？
What is happening?

737
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,840
那群浪在搭建一個懸浮橋
The wolves are forming a suspension bridge.

738
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,520
- 這怎么可能？  - 我也不知道
- How is that possible? - I don't know.

739
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,870
好吧 我們走！
All right, let's go!

740
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,750
一座橋！
A bridge!

741
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,870
我們有可能會死啊！
We're probably gonna die!

742
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,180
抓住他們
Chase, chase, chase!

743
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,880
快走！
Let's go!

744
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,170
- 那扇門掉了！  - 別管它了！
- The door!  - Leave it!

745
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,120
快要抓到了
Almost gotcha, almost gotcha, almost gotcha!

746
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,320
我的天吶 我們可以用那東西充當一個東西！
Oh, my gosh! We can use that thing as a thing!

747
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,870
對！ 充當一個東西
Right! To thing to the thing!

748
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,590
快走！
Let's go!

749
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,170
- 你聽起來像一個猴子  - 你聽起來才像一個猴子！
- You sound like a monkey. - You sound like a monkey!

750
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,900
群狼聽令 開啟船艇模式！
Wolf pack, form of wolf boat!

751
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,470
船艇模式！
Boat!

752
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,860
你們在開玩笑嗎？
Are you kidding me?

753
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,350
那太荒謬了！
That is so unpredictable!

754
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,520
哈哈！
Ha-ha!

755
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,190
群狼聽令！ 開啟潛艇模式！
Wolf pack! Form of submarine!

756
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,580
潛艇模式！
Submarine!

757
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,360
我不知道原來狼群可以變成一艘潛艇！
I didn't know wolves could form a submarine!

758
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,390
我以前都沒有見到過這樣的事情
I've never seen that before on nature shows.

759
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,230
好 快點 快到那架飛機那！
Okay, quick, get to the plane!

760
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,650
什么？ 我以為它已經壞掉了
What? I thought it was broken.

761
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,910
不 我之前修理了幾個部分了
No, I fixed it with some spare parts.

762
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,470
我們快到了 我們快到了
We're gonna get ya. We're gonna get ya.

763
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,200
好 快走！
All right, let's go!

764
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,390
朱尼爾！
Junior!

765
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,280
顯而易見的 我沒辦法按下這個按鈕
Obviously, I'm not gonna push it.

766
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,670
等一下！
Wait!

767
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,990
或許我可以輕輕的按下它
Oh, I could push it so easily.

768
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,670
這會用到那么稍微小小的武力
It would take such a little amount of force.

769
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,270
別那樣看著我
Don't look at me like that.

770
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,390
如果你不給我們那個小家伙 我們會吃掉你的
If you don't give us Tiny Thing, we're gonna eat you.

771
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,950
我們無論如何都會吃掉你的！
We're gonna eat you anyway!

772
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,310
你別那么說
You don't say it.

773
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,550
你得先做個交易 然后你再吃掉他們
You make the deal and then you eat them anyway.

774
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,720
知道了
Gotcha!

775
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,990
我們不打算吃掉你！
We're not going to eat you!

776
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,470
現在說這句太晚了！
Well, now it's too late!

777
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,470
不！ 不！
Oh, no! No!

778
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,270
- 朱尼爾！  - 快走！
- Junior!  - Let's go!

779
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,140
好了 開始飛吧！
All right, let's fly!

780
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,320
這還是不能飛啊
It doesn't fly.

781
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,110
- 什么？  - 它要掉下去了！
- What? - It falls!

782
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,310
為什么我要救你？
Why did I save you?

784
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,550
群狼聽令！ 開啟飛機模式！
Wolf pack! Form of wolf plane!

785
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,110
- 快點！ 快點！  - 我們走吧！
- Come on! Come on!  - Let's go!

786
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,470
小家伙 快回來！
Tiny Thing, come back!

787
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,510
回來 小家伙 我們需要你！
Oh, come back, Tiny Thing. We need you!

788
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,750
我的孩子
My baby.

790
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,720
什么鬼？
What?

791
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,470
再多五分鐘 然后我們就停止
Five more minutes and then we stop

792
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,640
你們在干嘛？
What?

793
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,990
- 再多5分鐘...  - 不！
- Five more minutes... - No!

794
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,880
那是我們的煙囪！
That's our chimney!

795
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,480
你們準備摧毀整個屋頂啊？
You're gonna destroy the whole roof?

796
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,710
媽媽 我們不得不把這個煙囪換成一個滑滑梯了
Mom, we have to replace the chimney with a slide

797
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,870
為了送子鳥給我遞送來的小弟弟
for when the storks deliver my baby brother.

798
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,040
他說什么
What he said.

799
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,540
不！ 別瘋了 你不可能做到的
No! Don't be crazy. You cannot do the chimney.

800
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,390
來嘛 別讓我讓我做個吝嗇的媽媽
Come on, don't make me the mean mom.

801
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,550
- 爸爸很有趣 媽媽很吝嗇  - 我聽到了！
- Dads are fun, moms are mean. - I heard that!

802
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,390
- 父母會議  - 集合！
- Parent conference. - Pinching!

803
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,710
海倫 人們可能覺得我們可能瘋了
Henry, people are gonna think we're crazy.

804
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,980
我們需要告訴他
We need to tell him.

805
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,160
告訴他什么？
Tell him what?

806
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,670
什么？ 給他看多點電視？
What, to go watch more TV?

807
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,550
在我的人生中 我陪伴他的這段時間是我人生中最好的時光
This is the best time I've had with Nate in my life.

808
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,080
我真正地再一次感受到了當爸爸的感覺
I actually feel like a dad again.

809
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,350
然后我們再告訴他小弟弟出現？
And when no baby brother shows up?

810
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,590
是啊 然后我們就告訴他
Well, then we tell him.

811
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,760
我們可以換得一個新的煙囪
We can get a new chimney,

812
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,050
但是我再也不可能有這樣的時間陪伴內特了
but we'll never be able to replace this time with Nate.

813
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,790
如果我們繼續帶著頭上的耳機
And if we put those headsets back on,

814
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,230
我們在內特多少歲時候才取下來？
how old will Nate be when we take them off again?

815
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,660
我已經不是一個小孩子了
I'm not a jerky teen yet.

816
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,190
飛逝的時光 寶貴的記憶
Fleeting moments, precious memories.

817
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,270
媽媽也很有趣
Moms are fun, too.

818
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,590
哇！ 這看起來只是一個豆腐渣工程
Wow! That's... That's not a well-made chimney.

819
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,560
我...我并不是個女漢子
I'm... I'm a small woman and that just came...

820
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,030
是啊！ 這太對了！
Yeah, that came right down!

821
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,470
好了 接下來該做什么？
Okay, so, uh, what's next?

822
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,110
好 現在是周六的晚上
Okay, it's Saturday night.

823
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,590
只要我們明天送到 我們仍然可以去參加大會
As long as we deliver by tomorrow, we can still make it for Storkcon Monday.

824
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,910
感謝你為了就我 而折回去
Thanks for waiting for me back there.

825
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,130
我不知道你在說什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

826
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,970
“我付有男子的氣概地承認所有的任何事”
Oh, okay, "I'm too manly to admit anything at all about anything."

827
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,040
那應該是我嗎？
Is that supposed to be me?

828
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,550
不好意思 “這是個更準確的陳述”
Oh, sorry, "This is a more accurate representation."

829
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,310
你太對了 那就是我想聽到的
Oh, you're so right. That is what I sound like.

830
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,270
讓我們就像這樣聊
Let's both talk like this.

831
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,030
寶寶現在很激動
Baby's fussing.

832
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,150
她很無聊呢 我們必須使她分心
She's bored. We have to distract her.

833
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,460
讓我來試試
Oh, let's see. Oh!

834
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,020
你是個寶寶 你是個寶寶
You are a baby You are a baby

835
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,200
小手   小腳丫
Little hands, little feet

836
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,090
- 看看你 你真的好可愛啊  - 停下！ 停下！ 停下！
- Look at you, you're so sweet
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

837
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,150
你太可愛了 以致使我要...
You're so cute I wanna...

838
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,610
我們一起到處走走吧 好嗎？
Let's just step aside, all right?

839
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,410
- 讓我來  - 你想給她唱首歌？
- And let me do it. - You want to sing to her?

840
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,660
是的 是不是很驚訝呢？
Yeah. Is that so surprising?

841
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,350
事實上 我是個優秀的歌手
I'm a pretty good singer, actually.

842
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,910
好了！ 唱吧
Okay, fine! Sing to her.

843
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,480
當你想要一些東西
When you need a little something

844
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,700
但有太多的事情要做
And there's too much to do

845
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,440
只要用你的小手輕輕點擊一下 我們就會給你運送快遞
Just click your little finger And we'll ship it for you

846
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,830
角落商店 角落商店公司
Cornerstore, Cornerstore. com

847
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,970
阿拉斯加和夏威夷不接受免費運送
Free shipping does not apply in Alaska and Hawaii.

848
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,670
等一下 這是歌嗎？
Wait, wait, wait, is that a song?

849
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,120
那不是歌 那是廣告
That's not a song, that's an ad.

850
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,390
- 好 為了生活拼命工作吧 小郁  - 好吧
- Well, strap in for this one then, Tulip. - Okay.

851
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,150
角落商店
Cornerstore

852
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,350
我喜歡這故事的發展
I like how this is going.

853
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,030
讓你的包裹落在我的身上
Let your packages rain down on me

854
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,750
這看起來像是一個可供晚上休息的地方
Uh, this looks like a good place to rest for the night.

855
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,370
朱尼爾 你在說什么？ 為什么你在自言自語...
Junior, what are talking about? Why are you acting...

856
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,570
我聽不到你在說什么
I can't hear what you're saying.

857
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,590
- 朱尼爾？  - 我聽不到！
- Junior?  - I can't hear you!

858
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,620
朱尼爾！
Junior!

860
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,550
你有沒有看到過一個紅色頭的女士和一只鳥？
Hey! Have you seen a red-headed lady and a stork?

861
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,750
一只鳥和一位女士？
A bird and a lady?

862
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,490
我不知道你在說什么
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

863
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,710
前幾天 我看見有兩個有著符合你描述的人！
I saw two that fit that description the other day!

864
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,910
不 我不會成為你的朋友
No, man, I will not be your friend.

865
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,350
對不起 我想我要離開了
Sorry, thought we were vibing.

866
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,190
為什么你變得那么可怕？
Why you being so creepy?

867
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,750
你知道嗎？ 就...這 這
You know what? Just get... Here. Here.

868
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,070
我只想把這東西放這兒
I'm just gonna put this right here.

870
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,790
這里發生什么了？
What happened back there?

871
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,310
什么？ 你什么意思？
What? What do you mean?

872
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,830
你刺破了那艘船？ 怎么看都說不通啊
Uh, you stabbed the raft? For literally no reason!

873
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,300
這不是沒有理由的 只不過是個私人的理由
It was not for no reason. It was for personal reasons.

874
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,670
不管怎樣 那個海岸上有一個港口
Anyways, there's a port right there on the coast.

875
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,330
我們早上要做的第一件事就是離開這里
We'll just leave first thing in the morning

876
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,790
然后繼續遞送包裹
and deliver the package.

877
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,750
請叫它“寶寶”
Just call it "the baby."

878
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,470
為什么你對嬰兒感到如此害怕？
Why are you so afraid of babies?

879
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,810
因為這個包裹
Because this one single package

880
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,220
會毀滅關聯著我整個人生的工作！
could ruin everything I've worked towards my entire life!

881
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,530
- 為什么你又想著當老板？  - 不是又
- Why do you wanna be boss again? - Not this again.

882
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,630
不 真的 為什么你總想做角落商店的老板呢？
No, really. Why do you wanna be boss of Cornerstore?

883
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,470
我不知道 好了嗎？ 我是說...
I don't know, okay? I mean...

884
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,070
為什么每個人都想做老板？
Why does anyone want to be boss?

885
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,240
這是規定好的 這就是原因
It rules. That's why.

886
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,310
是啊 但是你又會做什么？
Yeah, but what would you do?

887
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,310
- 我不知道 你會做什么？  - 我很高興你提出的問題！
- I don't know. What would you do? - I'm glad you asked!

888
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,430
好 第一 我會雇用一堆做運送的鳥和其他動物
Well, for one, I would employ a more diverse variety of birds and animals.

889
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,630
第二 我會除去角落商店的不良安置
Two, I would get rid of the Cornerstore warehouse

890
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,310
因為那個建筑就是個失敗品
because that building is a bummer.

891
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,550
第三 我會再次開始遞送寶寶
And three, I would start delivering babies again.

892
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,320
好了 你對這個問題做了很多準備呀
Okay, you were very prepared for that question.

893
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,600
我感覺我離你太近了
Man, I feel so close to you.

894
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,770
就像我們是閨蜜一樣
Like we're girlfriends already.

895
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,130
好吧 我知道我說完那句話后
All right, I knew as I was saying it

896
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,650
就應該閉上嘴
that I should just keep my mouth shut.

897
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,470
我想立即給你的羽毛編編發！
Aw, I want to braid
your feathers immediately!

898
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,630
看
Look, uh...

899
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,060
耶？
Yeah?

900
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,510
現在真正的坦誠相待時 我告訴你為什么我建造了那架飛機
While we're being real honest right now, I'll tell you why I built my plane.

901
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,590
那不是用來為角落商店遞送包裹的
It's not to deliver packages for Cornerstore.com.

902
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,830
我建造它就是為了能找到我的父母
I built my plane to find my parents.

903
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,550
但是我想你不知道你的父母在哪里
But I thought you didn't know where your parents lived.

904
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,510
當賈斯伯摧毀了我的定位器時 我失去了所有的碎片
When Jasper destroyed my homing beacon, I lost all the pieces.

905
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,030
除了這一片
Except one.

906
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:01,390
我就在想 運氣好的話也許能夠找到我的父母
And I thought this, plus some luck might be enough to find my parents.

907
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,870
所以說 你是為了這個孩子而犧牲飛機的嗎
So, you sacrificed your plane for this baby?

908
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,710
- 是啊  - 為什么？
- Yeah.  - Why?

909
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,870
我不知道 我猜如果這個孩子找到了她的家庭
Oh, I don't know. I guess if this baby finds her family,

910
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,790
我的意思是 這很值
I mean, it's worth it.

911
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,510
是吧？
Right?

912
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,070
好吧 你可以給她起名字了
Fine. You can name her.

913
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,750
- 真的嗎？  - 是的 來吧
- Really?  - Yeah, go ahead.

914
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,030
小石頭
Diamond Destiny.

915
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,530
好吧 我改變主意了 你不能給她起名字
Okay, I changed my mind. You can't name her.

916
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,130
太遲了！ 她的名字就是小石頭  就是這個！
Too late! Her name is Diamond Destiny.  Yes, it is!

917
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,770
我說這要是個 像個 真實的名字
I thought it was gonna be, like, an actual name.

918
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,450
這就是啊 小石頭就是她的名字！
It is a name. Diamond Destiny is her name!

919
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,390
有什么不對的嗎 小石頭？
Isn't that right, Diamond Destiny?

920
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:34,230
我們要幫你找到你的父母咯 一切都會很順利的
We're gonna find your parents, and everything is gonna be just perfect.

921
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,150
你會找到你的家
You'll find your family.

922
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,630
你想嗎？
You think?

923
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,020
當然
For sure.

924
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,550
晚安
Good night.

925
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,740
晚安！
Good night!

927
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,550
發生什么了？ 我起床了
What is it? I'm up.

928
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,590
你覺得她是不是餓了？
Do you think she's hungry?

929
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,030
我不知道
Yeah. I don't know.

930
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,230
可能她需要搖一搖
Uh, maybe she just needs to be rocked.

931
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,920
好吧
Okay.

932
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,440
天吶
Oh, my gosh.

933
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,990
她的眼睛不能再打開了
Her eyes could not be more open.

934
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,670
好吧 抓住那頭
Okay, grab that end.

935
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,230
這就像我們是一家人
It's like we're a family.

936
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,500
我們不像一家人
We are not like a family.

937
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,830
我們就是兩個正在哄寶寶睡覺的兩個人
We're just a guy and a girl trying to put our baby to sleep.

938
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,550
就讓他在這里睡吧
Let's just put her to sleep.

939
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,310
快點 快合上
Come on, close, close, close.

940
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,310
好了 合上 合上 合上 合上
Okay, close. Close, close, close.

941
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,450
這太棒了 對吧？ 她合上雙眼了嗎？
That's good, right? Is that closed enough?

942
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,160
不！ 看 我還能看見她的眼球
No! Look, I can still see eyeball.

943
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,590
我們能用手來讓她的眼睛閉上嗎？ 這里
Can we manually close them? Here.

944
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,630
不！ 別那樣做！ 你在干什么？
No! Don't do that! What are you doing?

945
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,770
我只是想...等一下！ 給我眼睛粘合劑
I'm gonna... Wait! Okay, give me the eye glue.

946
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,610
- 什么？  - 你知道 就是為了讓眼睛合起來那種
- What? - You know, for gluing eyes shut.

947
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,190
不 我們沒有這東西
No, we don't have any.

948
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,510
要粘上了
It's gonna stick.

949
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,150
如果她絕不睡覺怎么辦？
What if she never goes to sleep?

950
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,650
你知道嗎？ 我搞定她了
All right, you know what? I got her.

951
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,370
你去睡覺吧 你去睡覺 這沒問題
You just go to bed. You go to bed. It's fine.

952
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,150
不 在你起床之前 我不會去睡覺 我不是很好
No, I don't wanna go to bed if you're gonna be up. I'll feel bad.

953
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,400
我知道 但是如果我去睡覺了
I know. But if I go to bed,

954
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,970
我會感覺很愧疚的  所以我不能睡覺
then I'm gonna feel guilty. And I just can't.

955
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,330
不 按我說的去做 聽我的
No, that's what I'm saying. Listen to me.

956
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,740
不 所以這就是你去睡覺的原因 而讓我來照顧她
No, so that's why you go to bed, and I'll take care of her.

957
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,230
好吧 我要睡了
All right. I'll go to bed.

958
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,120
我不能相信你真的睡了！
I can't believe you went to bed!

959
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,130
什么？你剛剛說了讓我安心去睡的啊！
What? You just said it was okay for me to go bed!

960
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,160
好吧 你知道什么？
Okay, you know what?

961
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,830
我們可以把她放在手臂上搖晃嗎？
Can we just rock her in our arms?

962
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,830
不 不能 這個沒有愛的小寶寶
No. We do not. No loving the baby.

963
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,190
你說剛剛說了“寶寶”
You said "baby."

964
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,750
好吧 我才不在乎 我一點都不在乎
Fine. I don't care. I don't care.

965
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,350
你喜歡她
You love it.

966
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,470
再見 大兄弟！
Goodbye, brah!

967
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,480
現在喜歡我了么？
How you like me now? Huh!

968
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,190
“現在喜歡我了么？”
"How you like me now"?

969
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,190
現在喜歡我了么？
How you like me now?

970
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,790
現在喜歡我了么？
How do you like me now!

971
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,070
曾經有一段時間
Now there was a time

972
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,110
那時 你那么喜歡我
When you loved me so

973
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,060
我并沒有做錯
I could do no wrong

974
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,710
現在你要知道的
And now you need to know

975
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,910
停止舞蹈
Dance break!

976
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,590
現在喜歡我了么？
How you like me now? How you like me now?

977
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,110
你確定你都看到了？
And you're sure you saw this?

978
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,740
是的 我確定我都看到了
Yes, I'm sure I saw this.

979
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,830
好吧 我們保持低調
All right. Let's keep this quiet.

980
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,270
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

981
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,310
感謝你的忠誠 
Thank you for your loyalty, Pigeon Toady.

982
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,910
或者應該叫你老板
Or should I say boss.

983
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,150
酷
Cool, cool, cool.

984
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,950
蒸汽房在電梯里 真的不可思議！
Whoa! Steam room in an elevator. Mind blown!

985
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,120
閉嘴！ 我在計劃中
Shut up! I'm planning.

986
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,320
那太酷了
Oh, that's cool.

987
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,590
好了 現在 聽著
All right. Now, listen.

988
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,270
首先 我們必須阻止那個遞送
First, we have to stop that delivery.

989
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,860
但是我們不知道他們要去哪
But we don't know where they're headed.

990
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,460
事實上 我們不會跟著他們
Indeed. We won't go to them.

991
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,750
我會讓他們...
We'll make them...

992
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,020
跟著我們
Come to us.

993
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,870
對！
Yes!

994
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,910
好 我走了
Well, I'm off.

995
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,910
你怎么突然就穿上衣服了
You're in a suit suddenly.

996
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,190
走吧
Let's go.

997
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,070
我的毛巾被吹走了
My towel blew away.

998
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,630
朱尼爾
Junior.

999
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,130
快醒醒 我們得走了
Wake up. We gotta go.

1000
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,190
我還在睡夢中啊
I'm still asleep.

1001
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,610
我知道 但是我們必須得趕路了
I know, we gotta go, we gotta go.

1002
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,130
再讓我睡一小會兒
Just let me sleep a little longer.

1003
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,540
寶寶已經醒了 船要開了 快起來
Junior. Baby's awake. Ship's leaving. Let's go!

1004
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,830
你去就好啦 反正寶寶在你的手上
You do it. You get the baby.

1005
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,630
我也很累好不好 不是只有你累
Junior, I'm tired, too!

1006
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,990
寶寶是你自己弄出來的 這不能怪我啊
You made it, you get it.

1009
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,300
我真棒
Yes!

1010
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,930
鉆石啊 快到我這里來 
Diamond Destiny, you come back here right now.

1011
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,960
我不想再到處跑了
I'm not fooling around.

1012
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,570
好啦 我們要坐船走了
All right, let's go. We got a boat to catch.

1013
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,250
好耶 我們要去坐船了
We got a boat to catch, oh!

1014
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,320
我們走吧
Here we go. On it.

1015
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,550
回家咯！
Home stretch!

1016
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,150
我們必要要保持絕對的安靜
We have to be absolutely silent.

1017
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,990
要是有一個人看見我們帶著小孩我們就完了
One human sees a stork with a baby and we'll get reported.

1018
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,350
好了 這是最后一個了 趕快搬上去吧
All right, last one. Let's pack it up.

1019
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,540
那是什么
What was that?

1020
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:06,780
聽起來像一個寶寶
Sounds like a baby.

1021
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,630
那里看起來不是很對勁
That's very suspicious.

1022
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,990
- 他到底在干嘛？  - 我不知道啊
- Why is she doing that?
- I don't know.

1023
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,630
拉尿？
Diaper?

1024
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
不是
Check.

1025
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,160
餓了？
Food?

1026
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,800
不是
Check.

1027
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:18,960
她可能是困了
Maybe she needs a nap.

1028
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,650
睡吧 睡吧 我親愛的寶貝
Rock-a-bye baby, on the treetop

1029
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,590
不是  她到底想要什么啊？
Nope. What is it? What does she want?

1030
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,880
聲音好像是從那里來的
It's coming from over there!

1031
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,290
我不確定 他好像要你抱抱
I don't know. She's reaching for you.

1032
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,320
可能她只是想要你
Maybe she just wants you.

1033
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,910
不 這不可能
No. That doesn't make sense.

1034
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,920
講道理 他現在應該很開心才對啊
Technically, she should be perfectly happy.

1035
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,850
我們要怎么辦？
What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?

1036
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,270
我完全沒有頭緒
I have no idea.

1037
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,520
不
Oh, no!

1038
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,920
別
Oh, no.

1039
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,830
她就要哭出來了！
She's gonna blow! She's gonna blow!

1040
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,040
我們到底要那她怎么辦
What do I do with her?

1041
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,560
抱他 快點！
Take her, take her. Just take her!

1042
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,870
噢 看
Ah, look at that.

1043
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,680
事實上看起來不錯啊
Actually seems to be working pretty well.

1044
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,190
她真好聞
Ha! She smells so nice!

1045
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,550
誰有你這么漂亮的眼睛啊 你有啊
Who's got the little  eyes? You do.

1046
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,230
你有啊
You do.

1047
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,430
不 那船要離岸了
Oh, no! The boat's leaving!

1048
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,190
不 不  快走 
No, no, no! Come on!

1049
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,910
群狼聽令  開啟貨車模式！
Wolf pack. Form of wolf minivan!

1050
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,140
貨車模式
Minivan!

1052
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,240
給我！
Give me a break!

1054
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,140
我的寶寶
My baby!

1055
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,690
耶 我們拿到了這個小東西
Ah! We got the Tiny Thing!

1056
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,480
這樣對寶寶來說不安全
This is not a safe way to transport the baby.

1057
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,910
- 我們現在是父母了  - 開慢點
- We're parents now.   - Just go slower.

1058
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,310
- 你說的對   - 慢點
- You're right, you're right, you're right. - Slower.

1059
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:00,870
很好
Okay, good.

1060
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,110
小東西 你覺得好嗎？
Is that good, Tiny Thing?

1061
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,990
小東西？
Hmm? Tiny Thing?

1062
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,790
我們又弄丟她了
We lost her again!

1063
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,310
快點 我們穿過這里還是可以趕得上船的
Quick! We can get to the boat through here.

1065
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,200
等等 你怎么跑得這么奇怪
Wait. Why are you running so weird?

1066
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,190
有什么是我不知道的？
What don't I know?

1067
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,590
我的老對手
My old nemesis.

1068
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,590
玻璃
"Glass."

1069
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,470
鳥兒們是看不到玻璃的
Birds can't see glass!

1070
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,520
把那個小東西給我們
Give us Tiny Thing.

1071
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,710
快走 小郁 我已經來不及了
Just go, Tulip. It's too late for me.

1072
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,840
你現在必須一個人去送她回家了
You've got the baby. you can deliver her yourself.

1073
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,950
什么？ 不 我才不要把你丟下
What? No, I'm not leaving you behind!

1074
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,950
我們可以戰勝困難的  只要我們一起
We can do this. Together!

1075
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,990
那個小東西在哪里？
Where's the Tiny Thing?

1076
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,610
- 好吧 小郁 你贏了   - 小東西！ 小東西！
- All right. Tulip, you got this! - Tiny Thing! Tiny Thing!

1077
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,810
- 好的 左  右 直走   - 那個小東西在哪里？
- Okay, left. Right. Straight. - Where's the Tiny Thing?

1078
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,870
直走 然后 左  右
Straight! Left! Right!

1079
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,070
噢 不 我慌了
Oh, no! I'm panicking!

1080
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,430
還是右 不 我的意思是左
Uh, right again! Left, I mean. Left!

1081
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,910
右 我是說右
Right! Right, I mean.

1082
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,950
左 左 右 右
Left! Left! Right! Right!

1083
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,630
左 左 左 沒錯就是這樣
Left! Left! Left! Right!

1084
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,150
左右  不  我的意思是 右左
Rolft! I mean, ralft!

1085
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,390
右  左  我說話已經不經大腦了
Right! Left! I'm just shouting words!

1086
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,230
這根本沒有用啊
This is not working!

1087
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,110
我們做到啦！
Oh-oh! We did that together!

1088
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,850
我幾乎每一次都撞到了玻璃
I ran into every piece of glass.

1089
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,150
有的時候還不止一次
Some, more than once.

1090
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,420
噢  天啊
Oh, jeez.

1092
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,650
要是有機會
What are the chances of that?

1093
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,280
我希望在玻璃工廠里狂歡
I guess, pretty high in a glass factory.

1094
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,390
- 小東西！   - 快走 
- Tiny Thing! Tiny Thing! - Come on!

1095
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,390
首先 我們先帶走那個小東西
First, we're gonna take Tiny Thing

1096
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,020
然后再養大她讓她變強 獨立的女人
and raise her to be a strong, independent woman.

1097
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,760
然后 我們就會吃了你
And then, we're gonna eat you.

1098
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,910
我們合作的很好
We made a great team.

1099
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,870
我的孩子
My baby.

1100
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,310
那是我的孩子
That's my baby!

1101
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,990
是賈斯柏
It's Jasper!

1102
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,190
我的孩子
My baby!

1103
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,190
- 不不不     - 我的孩子！
- No, no, no!    - My baby! My baby! My baby!

1104
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,390
放開！
Let go!

1105
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,230
放開我們
Let go of us!

1106
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,390
群狼聽令  啟動...
Wolf pack, form of...

1107
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,030
心碎模式
Broken heart!

1109
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,820
離我們遠點
Get away from us!

1110
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,200
- 遠點！   - 別動！
- Get away!   - Stay back!

1111
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,240
- 快滾回家   - 別過來了
- Go home!   - Come on!

1112
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,400
別逼我打你
Don't make me hit you!

1113
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:17,350
-  這件事我可以解釋  - 你想都不要想
- Hey, hey, hey! Let me explain! - I don't wanna hear it!

1114
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,010
但當你令我變成孤兒的時候 你竟然說這糟透了
When you orphaned me, you said "whoops!"

1115
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,680
糟透了！誰能說出這種話啊
Whoops! You said "whoops!" Who does that?

1116
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,390
你就不能讓我解釋么
Will you please let me explain?

1117
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,710
他根本就不想聽你的解釋　明白嗎？
Hey! She doesn't wanna hear your explanation, guy!

1118
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:25,950
給我退后
Back off!

1119
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,110
其實我當時已經愛上你了
I fell in love with you.

1120
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,480
那你繼續講下去
Okay, fine.

1121
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,390
講道理　我非常八卦　讓我們聽下去
Honestly, I am very curious.　Let's hear it.

1122
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,670
他們說做一名送子鳥是很不容易的
Look, they tell you being a stork isn't gonna be easy.

1123
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,950
應生命遞送！
Always deliver.

1124
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,070
但是我辜負了這個職業
I failed to do that.

1125
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,150
你的定位器碎了 碎片掉落在了世界各地
Your beacon broke. The pieces scattered.

1126
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,870
我畢生都在尋找
I spent my entire life

1127
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:50,670
尋找那些丟失了的碎片 讓我的孩子可以回家
searching for the missing pieces so that I could deliver my baby.

1128
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,510
那么多年拿過去了 我仍然那沒找齊 還差一塊
And yet, after all these years, I'm still missing one piece.

1129
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,690
- 但是我過誓了  - 我的天啊  等等
- But, I have pledged...  - Oh, my gosh! Wait.

1130
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,470
要成為你的父母 小郁
...to be the parent I took from you, Tulip.

1131
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,350
而我會傾盡我的生命
And I will lay down my life.

1132
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,190
那個碎片在我身上
I have the missing piece!

1133
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,870
等等  你說什么？
Excuse me, what?

1134
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,110
那個碎片在我身上
I have the missing piece.

1135
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,430
我的家
My home!

1136
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,260
我要回家了
I'm going home!

1137
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,470
我終于可以見到我的真正的家人了
I'm gonna finally meet my real family.

1138
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,110
天啊！
Oh, my gosh!

1139
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,150
這太瘋狂了  你能相信嗎？ 朱尼爾
This is crazy! Junior, can you believe it?

1140
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,870
是啊  這真的太棒了
No, that's so... That's so great.

1141
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,630
你是該走了
Yeah, yeah, you should go.

1142
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,190
是啊 當我們送完這個寶寶之后
Oh, yeah, well, after we deliver the baby. But, yeah!

1143
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,350
不 不 不  我能照顧好這個寶寶
No, no, no. I can take care of the baby.

1144
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,630
不應該走了
You should go now.

1145
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,850
不行 我們還沒有完成我們的任務
No, no, no. We have to finish the delivery.

1146
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:42,940
我恨抱歉打擾你們
I'm sorry to cut you off.

1147
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,070
你知道嗎？ 搞笑的的 當你說出 真正的家人的時后
You know what's so funny is just then when you said "real family",

1148
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,640
我的心如刀割啊
it, like, weirdly hurt my feelings.

1149
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,950
但是我意識到我怎么能如此愚蠢
But I realized how stupid that is.

1150
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,350
我的意思是 我只是一只鳥 而你是一個人啊
I mean, I'm a bird and you're, like, a sloppy human

1151
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,030
而且 這也不是我們的寶寶  只是一個寶寶
and that's not our baby. It's just some baby.

1152
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,270
這么說吧  我們的確不像一個家庭 但是我們就像一家人一樣
Well, I mean, we're not, like, a "family", but we are like a family.

1153
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,980
這就像 我們不僅是我們 還是這間公司
Well, it's like we are except instead we're more like employees

1154
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,810
正在遞送這個寶寶的員工
who are delivering a package, and that's all.

1155
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,150
你知道我什么意思嗎？
Do you know what I mean?

1156
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,610
你應該要回到那個屬于你的地方了
And you should go to where you belong.

1157
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,830
現在 你知道我的意思了嗎
Now. Do you know what I mean?

1158
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,710
不 我們是一個團隊 明白嗎 朱尼爾
No! Junior, we are a team, okay?

1159
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,080
我們要遞送這個寶寶
We're gonna deliver this baby,

1160
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,330
而且要一起去見我們父母
then we're gonna meet my parents,

1161
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,670
- 然后我們在帶他們去送房子鳥山上參觀   - 我當時真的就應該直接開除你的
- then I'm gonna show them Stork Mountain. - I was supposed to fire you.

1162
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,900
知道嗎
Okay?

1163
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,670
我原本要被開除？
You were supposed to fire me?

1164
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,190
是啊
Yeah.

1165
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,030
應該說是“解放” “自由”  好吧 是開除
Well, "liberate". "Free". Yes, fire.

1166
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,810
而我并沒有這么做 沒有讓這些成為現實
And then I didn't, and then this all happened.

1167
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,240
聽著 松子鳥山上沒有什么值的你回去的
Look, there's nothing waiting for you back at Stork Mountain.

1168
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,350
沒有人在乎
Who cares though?

1169
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,330
現在是時候去和你真正的家人重逢
It's time for you to go and meet your real family!

1170
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,270
這很凌然激動 不是嗎？
That's exciting, right?

1171
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,400
聽著 我...
Look, I...

1172
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,030
我只是覺得這樣對你最好 明白嗎？
I just think this is for the best, you know?

1173
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,230
這正是你一直所希望的 不是嗎
It's what you've always wanted.

1174
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,720
是啊 我渴望見到我的家人
Yeah, I wanna go meet my family.

1175
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,510
所以我覺得我最好現在就走
So, yeah, I better go now, I guess.

1176
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,910
沒關系 我會照顧好這個寶寶的
It's gonna be fine. I'll take good care of her.

1177
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,390
好的  我應該走了
- Okay, okay. - Fine.

1178
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,710
再見了 孩子
Goodbye, little girl.

1179
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,870
希望你旅途愉快
Have a good trip back home.

1180
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,430
你自己小心
You take care...

1181
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,870
安全
And be safe.

1182
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,430
我害怕
I'm scared.

1183
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,630
他們是你的家人 他們會喜歡你的
They're your family. They're going to love you.

1184
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,710
我就在這里等你
I'll be right here.

1185
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,430
噢 給你的手機
Oh, oh! Give me your camera.

1186
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,950
我超愛抓拍這些溫馨的時刻
I'd love to capture this family moment.

1187
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,550
好了 我已經在拍了
Okay, camera rolling and action.

1188
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,670
你可以的
Yup. Okay.

1189
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,470
按門鈴吧
Ring the doorbell.

1190
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,950
我沒有聽到門鈴呢
I don't hear a doorbell ringing.

1191
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,550
你是對的 讓我們一起見證這個時刻吧
You're right. Let's take our time.

1192
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,950
這個時刻我等了一輩子啊
I've only waited my whole life for this!

1193
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,280
小郁
Tulip?

1195
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,510
是送子鳥
The storks!

1196
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,400
噢 天啊！
Oh, boy!

1197
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,250
- 我們來了  - 我的天啊！
- Here we go! - Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

1198
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,730
- 記得微笑   - 我現在甚至有點點緊張
- Okay. Big smile! - I'm a little nervous. Okay.

1199
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,190
大家冷靜一點
Everyone, calm down!

1200
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,790
這些不符合規定
This is not to code.

1201
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,550
- 什么？  這個都要撤下來
- What? - This all has to come down.

1202
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,320
亨特？
Hunter?

1203
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,310
你被開除了  - 但是 但是...
- You're fired! - But, but, but...

1204
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,290
但是什么但是  你真是太愚蠢了
"But, but, but..." You are so idiotic!

1205
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,540
你怎么就沒發現呢？
How were you not suspicious?

1206
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,760
我以為這只是一個高檔社區
I thought it was a gentrifying neighborhood.

1207
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,870
沒想到在這里也能見到你啊
Didn't expect to see you here, brah!

1208
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,710
沒錯 這是我干的
Oh, yes, I did. I set it up.

1209
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,100
把那個東西拿走
Seize the thing!

1210
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,750
不 別拿那個寶寶
Wait, no! Not the baby!

1211
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,430
別擔心 我們會好好照顧她的
Don't worry. She's gonna be fine.

1212
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,700
她會和企鵝在一起的
She's with penguins.

1213
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,640
有關于他們作為一個保姆是多么偉大的記錄
They have whole documentaries about how great they are at babysitting.

1214
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,090
而且她會是一個優秀的游泳健將
And she'll be an excellent swimmer.

1215
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,870
等到她老了我們會送她回到人類的世界的
And then when she's old enough, we'll return her to the human world.

1216
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,390
你簡直是瘋了 你應該把她送回家
That's insane! You need to deliver her!

1217
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,830
我們不能讓一個新上任的老板頭簍子
We can't let it get out that the new boss accidentally made a baby!

1218
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,950
我們的股票會跌停的 我們所建造的一切
Our stock would plummet, everything we've built.

1219
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,390
我的整個公司都會倒閉的
My entire company will fall apart!

1220
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,230
那些父母是不會發現這一切的
Those parents can never find out.

1221
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,110
好了 我們可以走了
Okay, we're ready to go.

1222
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,710
現在誰才是寶寶呢
Who's the baby now?

1223
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,190
做得好
Good enough.

1224
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,110
- 違章建造？   - 為什么
- "Cease and desist"?  - Why?

1225
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,910
這不符合我們的規定 確切的說 是很危險
This is not up to code, and quite frankly, it looks dangerous.

1226
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,080
我們不能把那些拆掉
We can't tear it down.

1227
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,320
因為這樣送子鳥就不會把握弟弟送過來了
'Cause then the storks won't deliver my baby brother.

1228
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,630
警察說的對 內特
The policeman's right, Nate.

1229
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,790
他們不遞送寶寶了  再也不遞送了
They don't deliver babies. Not anymore.

1230
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,750
那我們做這一切的意義在哪里
Then why did we do all this stuff?

1231
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:37,430
因為我們很享受和你在一起
Because we were having such fun playing with you.

1232
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,510
親愛的 我們一起度過了這段愉快是時光
Oh, honey. We spent time together.

1233
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,430
而這正是意義所在
And that's what matters.

1234
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,950
所以這是違法了還是說只是一個警告？
So is this like a ticket thing or a warning thing?

1235
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,400
這感覺像是一個警告 對吧
It feels like a warning, right?

1236
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,480
是啊 我們已經收到警告了 已經知道自己錯哪了
Yeah, we are warned. We are properly warned.

1237
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,070
我能理解你的心情
Oh, buddy.

1238
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,870
走吧
Come on.

1239
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,430
什么鬼
What?

1240
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,560
我的天啊 你還好嗎
Oh, my gosh! Are you okay?

1241
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,960
發生什么事了 孩子在哪里
What happened? Where's the baby?

1242
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,310
他們綁了我 然后帶走了他
They tied me up and took her.

1243
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,810
為什么會覺得這是她的家
Why would you think this was her house?

1244
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,610
這附近可都是倉庫啊
It's surrounded by a bunch of scary warehouses!

1245
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:52,640
可是很高檔啊
Gentrification!

1246
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,810
他們怎么就帶走她了 你的責任心呢？
How could they just take her? She was your responsibility!

1247
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,010
這不是我的錯 好嗎
It wasn't my fault, okay?

1248
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,930
我沒有在怪你 我只是在擔心那個寶寶
I'm not blaming you. I'm just worried about the baby!

1249
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,910
我也很擔心啊 我就是為什么我在壕叫
Well, I'm also worried, which is why I'm yelling!

1250
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,680
我們在嚎叫是因為我們在浪費時間
We're yelling 'cause we're wasting time!

1251
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,630
我們要怎么回到角落商店呢
How can we get back to Cornerstore?

1252
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:06,790
你在干嘛？ 購物嗎？
You're shopping? What are you doing?

1253
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,250
我明白了  這樣我們就可以躲在箱子里
Oh, I see. You did that so we could hide in the box

1254
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,570
快速的回到角落商店了
and get back to Cornerstore real quick.

1255
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:14,710
- 沒錯   - 你真聰明 
- That's right.  - Yeah.

1256
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,580
等會兒  這里發生什么事了 朱尼爾
Wait a minute. Junior, what is going on?

1257
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,510
這是什么鬼
What the heck is this?

1258
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,310
這是送子鳥大會
This is Storkcon.

1259
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:26,390
每年 松子鳥們只為這一件事情而相聚到一起
Once a year, storks come together for one thing.

1260
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:27,560
這就是 送子鳥大會
Storkcon!

1261
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,500
這是地球上送子鳥們最廣泛的習俗   那里的鳥兒們...
The biggest stork convention on the planet Earth, where birds and...

1262
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:32,870
朱尼爾？  干嘛？
- Uh, Junior? - What?

1263
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,800
你在干嗎啊  我們還要去救那個寶寶啊
What are you doing? We have to save the baby.

1264
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,670
我可是大會的超級粉絲啊
I'm just a huge fan of Storkcon.

1265
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,060
因為這真的是太酷了
'Cause it's so cool.

1266
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,590
那里 看！
There. Look, look, look!

1267
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:41,710
他們往樓頂去了
They're headed towards the flight deck.

1268
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,550
別大驚小怪 這能讓我冷靜
What? It calms me.

1269
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:49,750
改變世界的第一個球就是
Presenting the world's first round box

1270
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,230
我們公司的商標
Sphericus!

1271
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,950
圓圈能圈住你的夢想
Circles can hold dreams!

1272
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,670
我們要怎么從擁擠的人潮中穿過去
How are we gonna get through this crowd?

1273
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,150
你們好
Hello.

1274
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,830
我充滿著夢想
I'm full of dreams!

1275
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,910
你們不應該回到這里的
Hey, you guys aren't supposed to be back here.

1276
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,600
對不起了 讓一讓
Pardon me, big guy.

1277
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:11,920
我充滿了夢想
I'm full of dreams!

1278
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,200
聽我講 小郁
Listen to me, Tulip.

1279
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,910
即使我們拿到了寶寶 我們也沒有辦法從這出去
Even if we get the baby, we have no way to get out of here.

1280
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,310
這里太大了
Storkcon is huge

1281
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,240
因為這里有來自世界各地的送子鳥
for storks come from all across the world...

1282
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:20,570
朱尼爾 我們能不聊這話個大會了嗎
Junior, stop talking about Storkcon!

1283
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:21,810
對不起 我錯了
All right, I'm sorry.

1284
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,440
因為這讓人無法自拔啊 
It's just really impressive. Here we go.

1285
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,590
放開那個寶寶 讓我來
Put down that baby!

1287
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,160
分析之后我們可以知道 銷售額一直在增長
Growth analytics suggest increased bandwidth

1288
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,950
使我們能創建我們公司的企業文化
enabling us to silo creative core components.

1289
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,120
我收到了你的短信
I got your text.

1290
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,890
對不起 我們只找到一個飛行器
Sorry, but we could only find one jet pack.

1291
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,330
好吧 給我飛行器 我要帶她離開這里
All right, give me the pack. I'm taking her.

1292
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,800
不行 讓我來帶她離開  - 門都沒有
- What? No, I'm taking her. - No way.

1293
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,050
你上次帶著她走的時候 你弄丟了她
When you had her last, you lost her.

1294
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,070
那是因為你離開了我   - 因你炒了我
- After you left us.  - After you fired me!

1295
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,520
因為你總會壞事
'Cause you're bad at everything.

1296
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,850
我希望我從來就不認識你
- I wish I'd never met you.

1297
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,210
我才希望從來就不認識你呢
well, you know what? I wish I'd never met you.

1298
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,970
只有一件事情能讓我們結束這一切
The only good thing to come out of all of this

1299
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,130
就是我帶著她離開
is this baby, and I am taking her.

1300
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,850
我覺得你會太喜歡這個寶寶而舍不得離開  所以我要帶她離開
This baby is far too precious and perfect for you. I'm taking her!

1301
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,050
- 我要帶她離開   - 我要帶她離開
- I'm taking her.  - I'm taking her!

1302
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,910
- 我要帶她離開   - 我要帶她離開
- I'm taking her!   - I'm taking her!

1303
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:53,030
那是什么？
What is that?

1304
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,630
不  我的下半球掉了
My pants fell down. Oh, no!

1305
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,150
- 我們到底要走哪邊   - 不知道啊
- Where are we going?  - I don't know!

1306
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:15,030
好吧 不是這邊
Oh, okay. Not that way.

1307
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,280
也不是這邊
Not that way either.

1308
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,440
你們好啊
Hey, guys.

1309
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,910
我們被包圍了
This is very overwhelming.

1310
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,000
把那個東西搶走
Hand over that thing!

1311
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:27,950
你們只要再靠近一步
Come one step closer,

1312
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,310
我就放手
and I will drop this.

1314
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:38,310
朱尼爾 把寶寶給我 然后我們之間就一筆勾銷
Junior, look, hand over the baby, and we'll let bygones be bygones.

1315
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:39,510
甚至...
More than that.

1316
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,710
你仍然可以成為
You can still be...

1317
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,060
為什么這不管用了
Why isn't it working?

1318
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,040
怎么可能只有一個寶寶
One baby?

1319
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,910
要不再來一百萬個？
How about a million!

1320
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,110
別！
Wait, no!

1321
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,670
危險
Danger. Danger.

1322
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:05,270
我以前想都不干想
I did not think that through.

1323
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,190
不
No!

1324
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,380
快關掉
- Turn it off! Turn it off!

1325
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,750
不馬上給我停下來
You stop it this instant!

1326
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,710
關掉這個！
Shut it down! Shut it down!

1327
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,670
我來幫你了
This is my moment!

1330
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:04,110
不
Oh, no!

1333
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,790
- 我們上！   - 快！
- Let's go!  - Come on!

1334
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,950
快抓住他們
Go, go, go! Grab it!

1335
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,250
- 這里 給我就好   - 抓住
- Over here. I got this one.  - Catch it!

1336
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,070
抓到了
Got it! Whoo!

1337
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,630
別擋道
Out of my way! Out of my way!

1338
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,950
不
Oh, no!

1339
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:56,470
一百萬個萌寶
One million babies!

1340
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,760
你們好 又見面了
Oh, hi.

1341
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:04,950
- 不  - 不
- Oh, no!   - No!

1342
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,150
狂歡吧
Come on!

1343
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,550
現在就讓我結束早該結束的吧
Now it's time to do what I should've done so long ago.

1344
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:13,390
摧毀萌寶工廠
Destroy the Baby Factory!

1345
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,590
不 你不可以
No, you can't.

1346
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,010
- 不  我可以   - 不  你不可以
- Yes, I can.   - No, you can't!

1347
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:17,510
- 不  我可以   - 不  你不可以
- Yes, I can.   - No, you can't!

1348
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,010
我們或許可以這樣對峙一天  但是我拒絕
We could go on like this all day. I'm just gonna go on

1349
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,710
我現在就要摧毀萌寶工廠
and destroy the Baby Factory.

1350
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,190
再見了 萌寶機器
Goodbye, baby-making machine.

1351
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,470
什么鬼？
What the heck?

1352
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,590
我早就告訴你寶寶是很聰明的
Told you babies were smart.

1353
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,030
寶寶是很蠢的 超級蠢
Babies are dumb. Babies are super-duper dumb.

1354
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,330
- 不 不 不 -  不 等等
- No, no, no. - No, no. Wait, no.

1355
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,920
- 小石頭 把這給我   - 你快停下來！
- Diamond, give it back! - You stop it, this instant! Stop! Stop!

1356
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:44,900
快
Come on!

1357
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,150
什么鬼？
What?

1358
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:48,590
不！
No!

1360
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,820
你們現在別來煩我 快滾開
Now get over here and get me out of here.

1362
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:32,430
好吧 你還是不要動比較好
All right. Don't move.

1364
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,670
什么鬼？
What?

1365
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:48,800
不
Oh, no.

1366
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,480
不~~~
No!

1367
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:51,590
用生命遞送！
Always deliver!

1368
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:55,440
你做到了
Whoo! You did it!

1369
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,110
我聽到我骨頭的聲音
I can hear my bones.

1370
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,430
好了 我們應該降落了 因為我真的很痛
Yeah, we should land because this hurts so much.

1371
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,200
我們做到了  就像我們是一家人一樣
We did it! We did it! We're a family!

1372
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:06,270
是啊  我們是一...
Yes! We're a...

1373
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,550
對不起 我好像毀了這個時刻
Sorry, I kinda ruined the moment there.

1374
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,550
我只是有點內出血
I just have so much internal bleeding.

1375
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,310
我們是一家人
We're a family!

1376
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:17,660
看看這些
Look at that.

1377
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,180
什么？  都我以為已經斷了
Uh, what? What? I thought it was broken.

1378
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:21,600
我覺得剛剛只是脫臼了
I guess it was just dislocated.

1379
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,360
我們剛剛落地那一刻 我可能把它接回去了
It must've popped back in when we landed.

1380
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,070
我竟無言以對
Oh, yep. What a twist.

1381
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:42,460
不
Oh, no.

1382
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,100
好多萌寶啊
So many of them.

1383
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,400
他們在扯我的羽毛
They're pulling my feathers!

1384
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,350
我們應該怎么辦
What are we going to do?

1385
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,520
所有人 聽我講一講
All right, everybody. Gather around. Gather around.

1386
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:55,070
有個煩人精問過我 為什么我想做一個老板
An annoying person asked me once why I wanna be boss.

1387
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,540
以之前一直不知道為什么
Well, I never knew why until today.

1388
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,590
我們送子鳥的名字因為遞送萌寶而得名
Baby delivery is our true calling.

1389
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:03,190
這不是只是一堆金屬和玻璃
This is not just a bunch of metal and glass

1390
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:06,510
或者是任何巨大的魔力水晶制造出來的
and whatever that giant magical crystal-looking thing is made of.

1391
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:10,150
這正是為什么我們送子鳥在地球上的原因
This is the heart of what storks were put on this Earth to do.

1392
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,430
這是我們的使命
This is our mission.

1393
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,670
我們因服務人們而自豪
We pride ourselves on customer service.

1394
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,790
這是一個從未得到過孩子的家庭告訴我的
Well, this is a family that never got the baby they asked for.

1395
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,260
制定一個計劃
Make a plan.

1396
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,070
堅持實行所制定的計劃
Stick to the plan.

1397
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:21,550
用生命遞送
Always deliver.

1398
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,630
說的是不錯 但是我們沒有多余的盒子了
That's great. This is great. But we don't have any pods.

1399
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,150
等等 大家都別慌 你們能等等嗎
Wait! Everyone, stop. Would you stop?

1400
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:32,320
我有一個注意
Hey!

1401
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,270
- 這個怎么樣   -  可以
- What about these? - Yes!

1402
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,470
謝謝你 賈斯柏
Thank you, Jasper!

1403
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,750
我同意
I agree.

1404
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:40,550
萌寶遞送是我們送出生就開始做的事情
Baby delivery is what we're born to do.

1405
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,430
我們應該怎么對他
Should we do anything about him?

1406
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:46,670
這...
It's...

1407
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:47,950
這沒關系
It's fine.

1408
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,630
他們來了 我的天啊
They're here! Oh, my gosh.

1409
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,120
我簡直不敢相信 他們就在我的面前
I can't believe it! They're here!

1410
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:50,460
真的是他們
They're here!

1412
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:15,630
在這里簽名
Sign here.

1413
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:16,830
還有這里
And sign here.

1414
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,390
這里
Initial here.

1415
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,510
最后是這里
Initial here, here, and...

1416
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,310
我愛你 我的女士
I love you, my little lady.

1417
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,630
而我們會一直愛你下去
And we always will.

1418
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:49,950
再見
Bye.

1419
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,300
看來你們是送到門口的
Oh, so you deliver to the front door.

1420
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,470
所以我們根本就沒有必要拆掉我們的房子
So we didn't have to destroy our entire house.

1421
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:56,640
是啊
Yeah.

1422
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,030
嘿 我要的是男孩兒
Yo, Stork! I ordered a brother!

1423
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,670
男孩啊
I ordered a brother!

1424
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,870
你想要親自喂她奶嗎
You wanna feed her her bottle?

1425
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,790
忍者的技能！
Ninja skills.

1426
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:18,590
你還好嗎
You okay?

1427
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,470
當然 我什么事都沒有
Of course. I'm fine.

1428
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,670
這的確很不好受
Oh, this does not feel good.

1429
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,630
每次遞送都會想這樣嗎？
Is every delivery gonna be like this?

1430
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,430
所以我說啊 這是一件苦差事
What can I say? It's a terrible business.

1431
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:31,110
我一直一來都感到不開心
I feel so sad all the time.

1432
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:33,390
不 事實上我現在很好
No. I'm actually fine now.

1433
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,570
是啊 你看起來裝的的確很像啊
Yeah, it looks like you're handling stuff real well.

1434
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,630
是啊 我真的沒事
Yeah. Look good, feel good.

1435
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,790
是啊 你真棒
Yeah, pretty cool, man.

1436
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,630
我只是在享受著美好的時刻
Just enjoying it.

1437
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,470
你知道的 你可以對我 傾訴任何事
You know, I'm here if you wanna talk about anything.

1438
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:45,760
- 我正在這里聽你講  - 不 我沒有想說的
- I'm here to listen. - Nope.

1439
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,970
好吧  你是真的裝的很像啊
Okay, well, it seems like you're handling it pretty well.

1440
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
是啊  我的確
Yeah, I am.

1441
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,690
- 你在發抖   - 你才在發抖！
- You're shaking.  - You're shaking!

1442
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,490
朱尼爾  你要只要把你的感想釋放出來就好了
Junior, it's okay to let your feelings out.

1443
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,520
我沒有任何感想
I'm not feeling.

1444
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,600
- 說出來對你比較好  - 我沒有任何感想
- It's healthy.  - I have no feelings!

1445
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:56,900
相信我 說出來會好很多
Come on, let it out.

1446
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,030

這是誰？ 爸爸
Who is it, Dad?

1451
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,110
媽媽和爸爸？
Mom and Dad?

1452
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,830
看來這就是她的家了
All right, guys.

1453
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,430
我們已經送她到家了
We delivered her.

1454
01:20:58,600 --> 01:20:59,600
我們走吧
Let's go.
