If it would be a bigger story, I could not help.

235
00:27:10,624 --> 00:27:12,444
武器是很危險的東西

236
00:27:12,546 --> 00:27:15,522
尤其是在憤怒的人手裏

237
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:22,249
錢的問題不太好解決

241

你姐姐就能自由了

242
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:45,374
我們得迅速 在案件審理之前

243
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:48,541
我拿到錢就告訴你

244
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:31,416
我們要是用這個的話很可能會死
This shows that we may die material.

245
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:35,499
你不會

246
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:39,666
-你的血對它沒有排斥 -這真的
Your blood does not reject material. -Tuuria indeed...

00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:47,166
-還有什麼我需要知道的 -實質效應
Do I need to know more? -Aineen effects.

248
00:28:47,249 --> 00:28:49,475
延遲癥狀比較明顯
Withdrawal symptoms are intense.

249
00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:53,343
比賽之後你可能會昏迷一段時間
You will lose consciousness after the match.

250
00:28:53,416 --> 00:28:56,916
你的心臟有可能受不了這些癥狀
Your heart will take either withdrawal symptoms or not.

251
00:28:56,999 --> 00:29:00,916
但這個我們現在也不能肯定
We can not know it in advance.

252
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:05,541
所以如果我打贏對手了 也可能被藥弄死
So if my opponent does not kill me, kill agent.

253
00:29:05,624 --> 00:29:09,416
我們只能說這是有風險的
We will tell only that this is risky.

254
00:29:14,374 --> 00:29:17,333
什麼計劃

00:29:18,374 --> 00:29:21,291
我介紹你去歐洲錦標賽資格賽

你得打敗三個對手
You have to be overcome in three installments.

257
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:31,083
我給你下注 你輸了 我也慘了
Have given the bet for you. You suck, so I told sucks.

258
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:36,208
但是我們最多能贏回6倍的錢
We can win up to six times the money back.

259
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:37,861
我有什麼好處
What is my contribution?

260
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:42,134
如果你能撐過3輪 你就能拿到12萬
120 000, if you can bear three rounds.

261
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:45,541
然後還有10萬
In addition, you will get 100 000 immediately to hand.

265
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:23,833
視頻會在基佬網上播放
