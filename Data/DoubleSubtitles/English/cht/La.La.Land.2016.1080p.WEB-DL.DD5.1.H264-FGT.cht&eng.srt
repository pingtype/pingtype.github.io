When else are you gonna get to see

140
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,430
這麼多好萊塢人員同時聚在一起
a very Hollywood cliche crammed into the same room?

141
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,630
我們會玩的很開心的
We'll make fun of it together!

142
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:54,080
萊克斯 我對你很失望 這沒什麼好玩的
"I'm disappointed in you, Lex. " There's nothing to make fun of.

143
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,150

This party is gonna be like... humanity at its finest.

#你要去追尋

人潮中的某人

182
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,020
不
No.

183
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,440
別這樣 搞什麼
Oh come on! What?

184
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,640
請你別再偷偷摸摸溜進我家了
Please stop sneaking into my home.

185
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,570
你覺得爸媽能管這地方叫家麼
Do you think Mom and Dad would call this a "Home"?

186
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,590
你幹嘛呢
What are you doing?

187
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,880
別這樣 別坐這上面
Please don't do that. Please don't sit on that.

188
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,540
真的麼
Are you kidding?

189
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,070
別坐在這上面
Please don't sit on that.

190
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,540
別在這坐著
Don't sit on that.

191
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,490
- 這是豪吉 卡邁克坐過的凳子 – 我的天啊
- Hoagy Carmichael sat on that. - Oh my god!

192
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,990
- 那個烤西紅柿我已經扔了 – 我真不知道你發什麼神經
- The Baked Potato just threw it away. - I can't imagine why.

193
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,630
- 現在你坐了上去 – 我給你拿了個地毯
- And now you're just sitting on it. - I got you a throw rug.

194
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,640
我不需要
I don't need that.

195
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,940
我要是說 邁爾斯 戴維斯在上面尿尿了呢
What if I said Miles Davis pissed on it?

196
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,710
簡直是侮辱人
It's almost insulting.

197
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,710
不是真的吧
Is it true?

198
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,880
你打算什麼時候收拾這些箱子
When are you going to unpack these boxes?

199
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,280
當我有自己的酒吧的時候
When I unpack them in my own club.

200
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,190
塞巴斯蒂安
Oh, Sebastian!

201
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,860
現在就好像有個女生跟你分手了 你還一直跟蹤人家
It's like a girl broke up with you and you're stalking her.

202
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,480
你沒再回去看了吧
You're not still going by there, are you?

203
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,040
這個
That's...

204
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,620
我不能接受他們把它改造成了個什麼桑巴西班牙參觀
I can't believe they turned it into a samba-tapas place.

205
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,350
- 我的天啊 塞巴斯蒂安 – 又桑巴 又西班牙餅
- Oh my god, Sebastian! - Samba. Tapas.

206
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,830
他們要麼就只選一個 把那一個做好
Pick one, you know. Do one right.

207
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,460
我想讓你見個人
I have someone I want you to meet.

208
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,230
我誰都不想見
I don't want to meet anyone.

209
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,920
不要 我誰都不想見
N- no, I don't want to meet anyone.

210
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:25,670
- 爸爸給你的嗎 – 是的
- Dad gave you this? - Yes.

211
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,760
你會喜歡她的
You'll like her.

212
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,550
我不覺得我會喜歡她
I don't think I'm gonna like her.

213
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,650
- 她喜歡爵士嗎 – 估計不喜歡
- Does she like jazz? - Probably not.

214
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,900
那我們能聊點什麼
- Then what are we gonna talk about?

215
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,820
我不知道 反正也沒關係
- I dont know! It doesn't matter.

216
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:33,670
好嗎
Okay?

217
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,480
你生活得跟個隱士一樣
Because you're living like a hermit.

218
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,960
你的車都沒有上保險
You're driving without insurance!

219
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,430
- 有關係嗎 – 是的 有關係
- Doesn't matter? - Yes. Doesn't matter.

220
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,520
- 好吧 – 你得認真一點
- Okay. - You need to get serious.

221
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,450
我還認識一個臉上有紋身的人 你該去見見
Well then I know a guy with a face tattoo you should see.

222
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,590
- 好吧 你真卑鄙 - 我真心的
- Okay, low blow. - With a heart of gold.

223
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,580
- 認真點 – 認真點嗎 勞拉
- Get serious! - Get serious? Laura...

224
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,740
我對我的未來曾經有一個非常認真的計劃
I... I had a very serious plan for my future.

225
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,420
我知道
I know.

226
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,520
這不是我的錯 我被騙了
It's not my fault I got Shanghaied.

227
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,580
你沒被騙 你是被宰了
You didn't get Shanghaied. You got ripped off.

228
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,000
有區別嗎
What's the difference?

229
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,230
我不知道 真相可沒那麼浪漫
I don't know. It's not as romantic as that.

230
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,320
別坐
Don't sit...

231
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,780
所有人都知道那人名聲不好 除了你
Everybody knew that guy was shady, except for you.

232
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,320
你為什麼把浪漫
Why do you say "Romantic"...

233
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,810
說得像髒話似的
like it's a dirty word?

234
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,180
沒付清的賬單可不浪漫 給她打電話
Unpaid bills are not romantic. Call her.

235
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,820
我才不打呢
I'm not going to call her.

236
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,150
事實是 你覺得
The thing is... You're acting like life's...

237
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,510
生活快把我打倒了
got me on the ropes.

238
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,620
但這就是我想要的
I want to be on the ropes.

239
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,890
好嗎 我只是
Okay? I'm just - I'm letting life

240
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,180
讓生活狠狠地打擊我 直到它慫了
hit me until it gets tired.

241
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,670
然後我就反擊 這是經典的以逸待勞
And then I'm gonna hit back. It's a classic "Rope-a-dope".

242
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:30,480
行了 阿里 我愛你 快收拾你箱子
Okay, Ali. I love you. Unpack your boxes.

243
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,160
- 我會把鎖換了的 – 你換不起
- I'm gonna change the locks. - You can't afford it.

244
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,190
我是涅槃的鳳凰
I am a phoenix rising from the ashes.

245
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,430
- 嗨 - 嗨 比爾 謝謝你讓我回來
- Hey. - Hey Bill, thanks for letting me back.

246
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,170
不客氣
You're welcome.

247
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,640
我想說 我跟以前不一樣了
I want you to know that you're looking at a new man.

248
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,110
好樣的
Good.

249
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,780
- 我現在是一個非常樂意在這裏的人 – 棒極了
- A man that's happy to be here. - Excellent.

250
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,470
- 我現在特別好相處 – 你會按著演出曲目表演對吧
- Very easy to work with. - And you're gonna play the setlist?

251
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
非常樂意
Happy to.

252
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,910
雖然沒有人在意我彈什麼
Even though I don't think anybody cares what I play.

253
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:39,520
但是 好的
But yeah.

254
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,650
如果 沒有人 指的是
Well, if by "Anyone" You mean...

255
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,520
除我之外的人的話 那就對了
anyone other than me, that would be correct.

256
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,300
我在意你彈了什麼 而且我不想聽到自由爵士樂
I care, and I don't wanna hear the free jazz.

257
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,250
行 好的
Right. Okay.

258
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,460
儘管 我
Although I

259
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,960
我以為在這個鎮子上
I thought that in this town worked

260
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,920
是大家互相聽取意見的
on a sort of "One for you, one for me" Type system.

261
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,480
那你意見更重要一點怎麼樣
How about two for you, one for me?

262
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,960
那都聽你的怎麼樣
How about all for you and none for me?

263
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,260
- 棒極了 – 行吧
- That's perfect! Yes. - Great.

264
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,640
-好的 - 好的 共同決定
- Okay. - Okay. Mutual decision.

265
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,390
是的 我決定的
Right. Made made by me.

266
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,680
是的 然後我同意了
Right. And I signed off on it so...

267
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,610
隨便 你怎麼說都好
Whatever. Tell yourself what you wanna know.

268

歡迎回來
Hello. Welcome back.

269
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,920
這表達方式真好啊 凱倫
There's a nice way to say that, Karen.

270
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,320
塞巴
Seb.

271
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,810
我是聽到你怎麼說了
I do- I do- I hear what you're saying.

272
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,080
但我覺得你說的不是心裏所想的
But I don't think you're saying what you mean.

273
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,020
是嗎 我覺得你沒聽我說的話 你被炒了
Yeah, I don't think you hear what I'm saying. You're fired.

274
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,220
我覺得你嘴上說的
That's what you're saying

275
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,830
不是你心裏想的 你的意思是
but that's not what you mean. You mean is..

276
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
滾蛋吧
You're fired.

277
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,930
按演出曲目表演
...play the setlist.

278
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,830
- 不 我說的是 太晚了 - 這是一個警告
- No. What I'm saying is "Too late". - It is a warning.

279
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,450
你到底 你到底來自哪個星球啊
What - what planet are you from?

280
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,050
- 別趕我走 別趕我走 - 很遺憾地通知你 塞巴 你被解雇了
- Don't fire me. Don't fire me. - You're done. I'm sorry, Seb.

281
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,990
可是今天是聖誕節
It's Christmas.

Yeah, I see the decorations. Good luck in the New Year.

283
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,630
我剛聽到你的演奏了 我想
I just heard you play, and I wanted to...

284
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,850
我不喜歡多軸運動控制器上面那些裂痕
I don't like the fissure on the GT scan.

285
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,430
你做過色盲檢查了嗎
Did you test for achromatopsia?

286
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,130
23日 受害者送達醫院時已死亡 犯罪嫌疑人笑著離開了警察局
D.O.A. On 23rd, perp laughing his face off at the P.D.

這是我的課堂
This is my classroom.

289
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,000
要是你不喜歡的話 出門左轉不送
You don't like it, the door is to my left.

290
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,490
女士 你為什麼一直犯那樣的錯誤

You be tripping?

293
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,320

前排的這位女生
The girl in the front!

310
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,240
- 逃跑 - 逃跑 這個建議不錯
- 'I Ran'. - 'I Ran'. A fantastic suggestion!

311
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,760
好的 鋼琴手 彈起來 讓我們唱起來
All right, piano man, tickle those ivories. Let's hit it.

312
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,910
一二三四
One two three four!

313
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,320
就是這個感覺
That's right!

314
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,800
#我獨自一人走在這條街上
#I walk alone the avenue

315
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:56,640
#從未預料可以邂逅如你這般的女孩
#I never thought I'd meet a girl like you

316
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,190
#邂逅如你這般的女孩 我
#Meet a girl like you... - Me?

317
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:04,790
#棕髮褐眼
#With auburn hair and tawny eyes

318
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,600
#你的那種眼神讓我如此著迷
#The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through

319
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,950
#徹底地使我沉醉其中
#That hypnotize me through

320
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:19,410
#我開始逃跑 我已經跑了如此之遠
#And I ran, I ran so far away

321
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,780
#然而我始終無法抽身離開
#I couldn't get away

322
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,270
好吧 我想起你了
All right. I remember you.

323
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,900
我承認那天晚上我有些無禮
And I would admit I was a little curt that night.

324
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,600
無禮
"Curt"?

325
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:55,550
- 好吧 我是個混蛋 我承認 - 對
- Okay, I was an asshole. I can admit that. - Okay.

326
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,810
但是要求一個嚴肅的音樂家
But requesting 'I Ran' from

327
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,470
演奏逃跑這種歌 太過分了
a serious musician is just... it's too far.

328
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,790
天啊 你剛剛是說一個嚴肅的音樂家嗎
My Lord! Did you just say "A serious musician"?

329
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:03,890
是啊
I don't think so.

330
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,700
- 我能借你的外套嗎 - 為什麼
- Can I borrow what you're wearing? - Why?

331
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,090
因為我下周有個試鏡
Because I have an audition next week.

332
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,050
我將出演一個嚴肅的消防員
I'm playing a serious firefighter.

333
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,260
所以你是個演員
So you're an actress. I thought

334
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,070
你看起來很眼熟 我在哪個節目上見過你嗎
you look familiar. Have I seen you on anything?

335
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:17,120
華納公司的咖啡店裏 經典一幕
A coffee shop on the Warner Bros. Lot. That's classic.

336
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,160
- 噢 我想起來了 - 對
- Oh, I see. - Yeah.

337
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,270
你是個咖啡師
You're a barista.

338
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,530
現在我知道
And I can see how you could

339
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,360
原來您居於如此高位 怪不得看不起我
then look down on me from all the way up there.

340
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,920
下一首
Next set.

341
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,860
他不 我不
He doesn't... I don't...

342
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,100
他從不告訴我要幹什麼
He doesn't tell me what to do.

343
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,900
- 他剛剛才告訴你 - 我知道 我讓他告訴我的
- He just told you what to... - I know. I let him.

344
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,730
- 你叫什麼名字 - 米婭 - 米婭
- What is your name? - Mia. - Mia.

345
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,320
我猜某天會在電影裏看到你
I guess I'll see you in the movies.

346
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,090
- 你知道約瑟夫 坎貝爾嗎 - 知道
- You know Joseph Campbell? - Yes.

347
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,130
我有這麼一個想法
I have this idea that you were

348
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,640
你可以從熊的角度
reimagining "Goldilocks and the Three Bears"...

349
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,090
來重新塑造金鳳花姑娘和三隻熊這個故事
from the perspective of the bears.

350
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,440
- 這會很驚悚吧 - 說不定還可以得到什麼特權
- You know it's thrilling. - It could be a franchise.

351
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:49,930
是的
Right.

352
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,800
我們不知道
So well we don't know if

353
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,140
他們有沒有被關在上面 我們不知道
they were cooped up up there. We don't know.

354
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,270
喬治 邁克爾
George Michael!

355
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,200
你好
Hello.

356
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,110
不好意思 我認識那個人
Sorry. It's - I know that guy.

357
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,920
你拿了你車鑰匙了嗎
Did you get your keys?

358
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,870
- 拿了 - 你能幫忙取一下我的嗎
- Yes. - Can you grab mine?

359
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,420
什麼
Sorry what?

360
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,940
你能幫忙取一下 我的鑰匙嗎
Will you be able to grab my... my keys?

361
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,010
我聽不清
I can't hear you.

362
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,870
- 不好意思 你能取一下我鑰匙嗎 - 噢
- Sorry, can you grab my keys? - Oh.

363
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,290
- 拜託 - 好的吧
- Please. - Oh, there we go.

364
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,710
- 謝謝 - 不用謝
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

365
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,020
- 哪種車 - 普銳斯
- What kind? - It's a Prius.

366
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,490
- 有好多普銳斯 - 有綠帶子的那個
- That does't help me. - With a green ribbon.

367
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,510
好了
All right.

368
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,560
鞋子看起來 額 很舒服
Those look, uh, comfortable.

369
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,200
是的
They are.

370
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,500
謝謝你讓我脫離了這無聊的派對
Thank you for saving the day back there.

371
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,580
你其實沒有給我太多選擇
Well, you didn't really give me much of a choice.

372
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,300
很奇怪我們一直遇見對方
It's pretty strange that we keep running into each other.

373
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,180
是有點奇怪
It is strange.

374
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,040
或許這意味著些什麼
Maybe it means something.

375
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,320
- 是嗎 - 是啊 或許是的
- I doubt it. - Yeah. I don't think so.

376
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,560
我車呢
Where's my car?!

377
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,320
把那個放在你下巴那
Put that thing to your chin.

378
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,890
- 這個 - 是的
- This? - Yeah.

379
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,730
它把你的頭變成了個天線
It makes your head into an antenna.

380
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,560
這會使你患上癌癥 但你能快點找到你的車
I think it gives you cancer but you find your car faster.

381
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,230
什麼
What?

382
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,690
我是說你活得不會太久
I mean you don't get to live as long but you get

383
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,240
但這樣你就會更快到達目的地 所以影響就相互抵消了
where you're going quicker so it all evens out.

384
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,810
- 這話太難聽了 - 只是一個建議
- That sounds terrible. - Just a suggestion.

385
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,220
你真是一個
You're a real...

386
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,770
- 我想說什麼來著 - 身穿閃亮盔甲的騎士
- What's the word am I looking for? - Knight in shining armor.

387
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,280
- 怪人 想說的就是這個 - 好吧
- Weirdo. That was the word. - Okay.

388
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,230
沒什麼可看的 是吧
Not much to look at, huh?

389
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,360
我見過更美的地方
I've seen better.

390
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,700
#暮色西沉
#The sun is nearly gone

391
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,980
#華燈未上
#The lights are turning on

392
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:55,410
#海天相接處銀光閃閃
#A silver shine that stretches to the sea

393
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,500
#我們在這般景色下偶遇
#We stumbled on a view.

394
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,000
#像是上天的精心安排
#That's tailor made for two

395
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,300
#但結果卻讓人難過
#What a shame

396
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,900
#無論對你 還是我
#to our, you and me

397
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:17,590
#換做別的俊男靚女
#Some other girl and guy

398
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,850
#肯定會享受這片別緻的天空
#Would love this swirling sky

399
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,250
#但現在卻只有你我兩人
#But there's only you and I

400
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:28,740
#彼此沒有那種心動的感覺
#And we've got no shot

401
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,420
#沒有一見鍾情
#This could never be

402
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,220
- #你也不是我中意的類型 - 是嗎
- #You're not the type for me - Really?

403
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:38,890
#此情此景 卻沒有半點火花
#And there's not a spark in sight

404
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:44,150
#如此良辰 真煞風景
#What a waste of a lovely night

405
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,900
#你說對我沒感覺
#You say there's nothing here?

406
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,730
#好 我先把話說清楚
#Well, let's make something clear

407
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,370
#要說也是我先說
#I think I'll be the one to make that call

408
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,220
#你要說什麼
#What's you call?

409
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,500
#儘管你英俊又瀟灑
#And though you look so cute

410
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,530
- #西裝革履 - 這是羊毛的
- #in your polyester suit - It's wool.

411
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,210
#但你說得對 我才不會愛上你
#You're right, I'd never fall for you at all

412
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,300
#也許你能迷倒
#And maybe this appeals

413
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:06,040
#那些不諳世事的女孩
#To someone not in heels

414
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,500
#或是那些
#Or to any girl who feels

415
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:12,800
#對你情迷意亂的女孩
#there's some chance for romance

416
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:17,690
- #但說真的 我對你沒有多少感覺 - #一點都沒有嗎
- #But I'm frankly feeling nothing - #Is that so?

417
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,490
#甚至一點點都沒有
#Or it could be less than nothing

418
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:22,480
#這麼說你也同意咯
#Good to know so you agree?

419
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,620
#沒錯
#That's right

420
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:27,160
#如此良辰 真煞風景
#What a waste of a lovely night

421
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,540

424
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,500
- 車就在這 - 就在這
- It's just right there. - Just right here.

425
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,740
要我載你去找車麼
Do you want a ride to your car?

426
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,010
不用 我的車就在旁邊
No, I'm just right up here.

427
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,350
晚安
Good night.

428
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,080
晚安
Good night.

429
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,150
打擾一下 這是無谷蛋白的 是吧
Excuse me. This is gluten free, right?

430
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,030
- 不是 - 什麼
- No - What?

431
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,360
我要退掉
I'd like a refund.

432
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,730
好的 我去看一下
Okay. Let me check it out.

433
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:58,110
米婭 週五你不上班
Mia, you're closing Friday.

434
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,660
週五我得上班 我有個試鏡 還記得嗎
I can't close on Friday. I have an audition, remember?

435
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,800
你覺得我在意你的試鏡嗎 我們說好了的
Do I look like I care? We schedule it.

436
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,280
還有 明天我們要開個小會
Oh and we need to have a little talk tomorrow, okay?

437
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:10,020
- 把你圍裙弄弄好 - 好的
- Fix your apron, please. - Okay.

438
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,330
又是你
You again!

439
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,840
你在這裏幹什麼
What are you doing here?

440
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,020
就是開個會啊 見個工作室老大啊什麼的
You know, just meetings and studio heads..

441
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,520
你是怎麼進片場的
How did you get on the lot?

442
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,690
我基本上是從安檢門衝進來的
I basically just run past the guard gates.

443
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,080
我覺得還要二十分鐘 他們才能發現我
I think I have 20 minutes until they find me.

444
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,560
- 一會兒你就休息了 是吧 - 我十分鐘後下班
- You have a break coming up, do you? - I'm off in ten minutes.

445
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,440
我能去洗手間躲躲嗎
Can I hide in the bathroom?

446
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:38,770
- 好的 - 好的
- Yes. - Okay.

447
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:41,930
抱歉
Sorry.

448
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,220
我還是要去看一下 抱歉
I actually do have to check. I'm sorry.

449
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:52,000
亨弗萊 鮑嘉和英格麗 褒曼在卡薩布蘭卡裏
That's the window that Humphrey Bogart

450
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,170
就是通過這扇窗戶向下看的
and Ingrid Bergman looked out of in Casablanca.

451
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,220
- 哇哦 - 是吧
- Wow. - Yeah.

452
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,620
真不敢相信你就在這對面上班
I can't believe you work right across the street from there.

453
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,870
- 是吧 - 太神奇了
- Yeah. - That's amazing.

454
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,130
你的 白馬王子 叫什麼來著
What was you're, uh, you're Bogart's name?

455
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,980
他叫什麼名字 是格雷格嗎
What's his name? Is it Greg?

456
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,120
是的 格雷格
Yeah, Greg.

457
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,280
好吧 你們交往多久了
Right. How long have you been...?

458
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,160
我們在一起大約一個月了
We've been seeing each other for about a month.

459
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,290
不錯啊
That's great.

460
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:15,840
他呀 他人很好 反正 我喜歡住在這附近
He's... uh... He's sweet. Anyway, I love being around this stuff.

461
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:16,520
你懂嗎
You know?

462
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:19,140
我知道你的意思 我到五英里外的地方買咖啡
I know what you mean. I get coffee 5 miles out of the way...

463
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,500
- 就是為了能靠近一家爵士樂俱樂部 - 真的嗎
- just so I can be near a jazz club. - Really?

464
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,180
是啊 貝克先鋒俱樂部 知道這家嗎
Yeah, the Van Beek. Do you know it?

465
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,490
大牌的搖擺樂團都在那裏演出過
All the big swing bands used to play there.

466
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,600
考特 貝茜 奇克 韋伯
Count Basie, Chick Webb.

467
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,690
不過 現在它現在變成了桑巴西班牙餐館
Anyway, it's a samba-tapas place now...

468
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:31,780
所以
So...

469
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,290
桑巴西班牙餐館是什麼
What's a samba-tapas place?

470
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,660
就是一個賣西班牙餅的桑巴舞廳
You know, it's like a samba place where they serve tapas.

471
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:39,030
- 哦 - 是啊 時間是把 殺豬刀
- Oh. - Yeah. So the joke's on... history?

472
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,810
我也說不好 這就是洛杉磯
I dont know. That's L.A.

473
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,790
他們
They just

474
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,930
他們追求一切 又不懂珍惜
They worship everything and they value nothing.

475
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,430
我們要開拍了 請止步
We're about to roll. Stop please guys.

476
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,990
- 你們要開拍了 - 是啊
- You're rolling? - Yeah.

477
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,690
他們天天在我家邊上拍電影 我們不會礙事的
They shoot movies on my street all the time so no problem.

478
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,410
- 來這邊 - 好的
- Come this way. - Right.

479
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,440
要清場
It's a lockdown.

480
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,440
- 我喜歡她 - 準備開始
- I love her! - And here we go.

481
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,650
米婭 你是怎麼進來的
Hey, Mia. How did you get into this?

482
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,990
- 準備 拍攝 - 進哪啊
- And... roll! - Get into what?

483
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,090
- 就是 電影啊 表演啊 - 開拍
- You know, movies, acting. - Action!

484
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,750
- 我姑媽是一名演員 - 哦 這樣
- My aunt was an actress. - Oh, okay.

485
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:11,370
她在旅行劇團工作
She was in a traveling theatre company.

486
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,710
我在內華達州的博爾德市長大
I grew up in Boulder City, Nevada.

487
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,780
我家對面
So across the street from my house,

488
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,000
有一家小圖書館
there was this little library..

489
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,600
裏面有一個老電影區
that had an old movies section.

490
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,840
所以她 她帶我去那裏
So she - she took me and spent an entire day

491
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:23,330
一整天都在看那些老電影
watching all these old movies...

492
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:27,870
像是 美人計 育嬰奇譚 卡薩布蘭卡 還有
like "Notorious", "Bringing Up Baby," "Casablanca" And...

493
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:30,080
這裏停一下 卡 看一下錄像帶
Cut it there! Cut! Check the tapes.

494
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,960
- 我們現在能說話了 - 聽起來她很了不起
- We can talk now. - She sounds incredible.

495
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,110
她是真的很了不起 我會
She was incredible. And I

496
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,160
把所有的劇本放在我的臥室
would put on all these plays in my bedroom...

497
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,320
然後基本上就是我和她
and it would basically just she and I...

498
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:40,440
重現電影裏的橋段
reenacting the scenes from the movies.

499
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,530
- 然後我寫了一部自己劇本 - 哇哦 - 是的
- And then I wrote my own plays. - Wow. - Yeah

500
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,210
我喜歡這裏
I love it.

501
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:13,780
總而言之 大學畢業兩年後我來到了這裏
So anyway, I left college after two years to come here.

502
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,670
還有 我上一次的試鏡是一個青少年肥皂劇
And my last audition was for a teen soap...

503
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,910
是把 危險遊戲 和 橘子郡男孩 糅在一起的類型
pitched as Dangerous Minds meets The OC.

504
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,520
所以說 唉 當初該去做律師的
So yeah, should've been a lawyer.

505
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,090
因為這個社會需要更多的律師
'Cause the world needs more lawyers.

506
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,630
不需要更多的女演員
Doesn't need more actresses.

507
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,990
你不止是個演員
You're not just an actress.

508
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,610
不止是個演員 是什麼意思
What do you mean "Just an actress"?

509
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,120
你自己也說了 你是個劇作家神童
You said it yourself. You were a child prodigy playwright.

510
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,580
我可沒這麼說
That is not what I said.

511
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:37,790
你只是太謙虛了 但事實確實如此
Well, you're too modest to say it but it's true.

512
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,900
所以你完全可以為你自己寫劇本嘛 比如
So you could just write your own roles, you know.

513
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,990
寫些和你一樣有趣的角色
Write something that's as interesting as you are...

514
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:44,740
你根本就沒必要去試鏡嘛
and you don't have to audition for this pishi kaka.

515
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:45,990
是哈
Yeah.

516
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,420
你看路易斯 阿姆斯特郎
Look at Louis Armstrong, you know.

517
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:48,440
他本可以只演奏
He could have just played

518
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,140
那些別人給他的行進曲的樂譜
the marching band charts that he was given.

519
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:52,940
- 但是他沒有那麼做 他做了什麼呢 - 他做了什麼
- But he didn't do it. What did he do? - What did he do?

520
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:54,490
他創造了歷史 不是嗎
He made history, didn't he?

521
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:56,280
你是說要我不要去試鏡了
Well, I'm gonna stop

522
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,290
而是應該去創造歷史
auditioning and I'm gonna make history instead.

523
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,590
嗯哼 我只能幫你到這了
Well, my work is done here.

524
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,960
我想是時候跟你坦白了
I should probably tell you something now.

525
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,500
說實話
To get it out the way.

526
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,010
我討厭爵士樂
I hate jazz.

527
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,560
你還好嗎
You okay?

528
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,120
你說你討厭爵士樂是什麼意思
What do you mean you hate jazz?

529
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,770
就是我聽爵士樂的時候 不覺得喜歡的意思啊
It just means that when I listen to it, I don't like it.

530
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:18,330
嗯 但這只是你不喜歡爵士樂的籠統說法罷了
Yeah but it's just a blanket statement that you don't like jazz.

531
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:20,340
你接下來有事嗎
What are you doing right now?

532
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:22,820
沒事
Nothing.

533
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:42,080
我在想啊 當人們在說
You know, I just think that when people say that,

534
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:44,920
你知道的 討厭爵士樂時
you know, hate jazz..

535
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,100
他們只是不懂而已
They just don't have context.

536
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,010
不知道它從何而來
They don't know where it comes from.

537
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:51,110
知道嗎
You know?

538
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,780
爵士樂誕生於新奧爾良的一小間低級住所
Jazz was born in a little flophouse in New Orleans...

539
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,930
就因為那裏擠滿了各地的人
and just because people were crammed in there,

540
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:58,540
說著五種不同的語言
they spoke five different languages.

541
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,620
他們沒法交流
They couldn't talk to each other.

542
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:03,040
他們能交流的唯一媒介便是爵士樂
The only way that they could communicate was with jazz.

543
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:04,760
那肯尼 基呢
You know, what about Kenny G?

544
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,030
什麼
What?

545
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:09,930
肯尼 基呢 我是說電梯裏的輕音樂呢
What about Kenny G? I mean, what about elevator music?

546
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,670
也就是我所瞭解的爵士樂
You know, jazz music that I know.

547
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,470
- 電梯音樂怎麼了 - 我生活中接觸到的
- What about it? - From my life.

548
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,170
我只是 我想說它讓人感到放鬆
I just - I mean find it relaxing.

549
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,580
它並不放鬆 並不是
It's not relaxing. It's not.

550
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,270
並不是
It's not!

551
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:21,020
西德尼 貝謝打了人
Sidney Bechet shot somebody...

552
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,670
就是因為那人說他吹錯了個音
because he told him he played a wrong note.

553
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:24,150
這可不叫放鬆
That's hardly relaxing.

554
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:27,520
我成長的地方 有個叫KJAZZ 103的電台
Where I grew up, there was this station called KJAZZ 103.

555
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:29,380
當人們開雞尾酒會的時候
And people would just put on

556
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,350
就會播放那個電台
that station when they had a cocktail party...

557
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,520
然後呢
Right.

558
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:34,730
接著每個人就只是聊天 並沒人聽
And everyone would just kind of talk over it.

559
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,090
- 我懂 - 對啊 這就
- I know. - Yes. It was..

560
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,620
對 我懂 所以我就覺得那 那是
Okay, okay. So I think that that's...

561
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:40,460
一部分問題就是你聽不到它 這樣
part of the problem is that you can't hear it, you know.

562
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,850
你就得去看 得去發現一些已經岌岌可危的東西
You have to see it, you have to see what's at stake.

563
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:46,250
我是說 看看這些人 看看那個正在吹薩克斯的人
I mean, look at these fellas. Look at the saxophonist right now.

564
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,440
他完全掌控了這首曲子 其中有他自己的成分
He just hijacked the song. He's on his own trail.

565
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:50,320
這些人都在作曲
Everyone of these guys are composing,

566
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,860
在自我編排 他們這是在創作
rearranging, they're writing...

567
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,840
在演奏旋律 他們就是
and they're playing the melody. They're just...

568
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:56,650
現在你看 那個小號手 他有自己的思路
And now look, the trumpet player. He's got his own idea.

569
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,320
這是衝突與融合的過程 這就是
It's conflict and it's compromise, and it's just...

570
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,250
每一次都是新的 每晚都是完全不同的
It's new every time. It's brand new every night.

571
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:06,170
非常 非常地激動人心
It's very, very exciting.

572
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:14,660
然而它卻瀕臨滅亡
And it's dying.

573
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:18,440
它在滅亡啊 米婭 它正在一點一滴地消亡
It's dying, Mia. It's dying on the vine.

574
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,420
人們卻說 讓它去吧 它已經過了它的黃金時段
And the world says, "Let it die. It had its time".

575
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:23,200
但在我眼皮底下休想
Well, not on my watch.

576
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,020
那你打算怎麼辦
What are you gonna do?

577
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,730
我會創建我自己的俱樂部
I'll have my own club.

578
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,980
- 真的嗎 - 真的
- Really? - Yes.

579
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:33,110
那樣我們想演奏什麼就演奏什麼 想什麼時候演奏就什麼時候演奏
We're gonna play whatever we want, whenever we want...

580
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:37,220
想怎樣演奏就怎樣演奏 只要是純粹的爵士樂
however we want, as long as it's pure jazz.

581
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:39,890
你好 我是米婭 多蘭
Hi, this is Mia Dolan.

582
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:41,970

Yeah, I just missed a call.

583

585
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:57,450

For a TV show. The one I was telling you about.

586
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:59,130

- Congratulations! That's incredible! - It's really exciting.

588
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,900
我之前好像還說它壞話來著
I feel like I said negative stuff about if before.

589
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:03,850
說什麼了
What?

590
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:05,700
像 莫名其妙的叛逆 之類的
It's like "Rebel Without a Cause" Sort of.

591
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:08,140
我可是有子彈的人 這樣嗎
"I got the bullets!"

592
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:10,130
對的

593
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,320
- 你沒看過吧 - 沒看過
- You've never seen it! - I've never seen it.

594
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,860
天哪 你知不知道麗都街都在放這個
Oh my. You know it's playing in the Rialto.

595
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,210
- 真的嗎 - 對啊
- Really? - Yes.

596
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:20,920

You should go. I mean, I - I can take you.

597

For research.

603
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:20,400
#星光之城啊 你是否只為我閃耀
#City of stars are you shining just for me?

604
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:30,130
#星光之城啊 世間有太多不可明瞭
#City of stars there's so much that I can't see

605
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:35,150
#誰又能明瞭
#Who knows?

606
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:41,490
#這究竟是一切美好開始的預兆
#Is this the start of something wonderful and new?

607
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:50,870
#還是又是黃粱一夢呢
#Or one more dream that I cannot make true?

608
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:20,210
- 請站在那 - 好的 很高興見到你

聽我的 或者是聽我的 明白了嗎
You either follow my rules, or follow my rules. Capisce?

617

620
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:54,310
嘿 寶貝 訂到前排位置了
Hey babe. Got a space out front.

621
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,670
- 太棒啦 - 我們得出發了
- Great! - We should get going.

622
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,250
我哥哥的飛機提前著陸了
My brother landed really early.

623
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,280
你忘了嗎
Did you forget?

624
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:03,620
- 該死的 - 你忘了
- Shit. - You forgot.

625
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,450
是今晚啊
That's tonight.

626
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:08,330
- 沒關係 - 好吧 - 你忘了 - 啊 好吧
- That's okay. - Yeah. - You forgot. - Yeah. Okay. All right.

627
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:09,910
那我就換衣服
So then I'll just get changed.

628
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:11,650
- 好勒 - 好 - 真棒 - 棒
- Okay. - Okay. - Great. - Great.

629
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,160
嗯 是他打電話來了 嗨 喬西 對
Yeah, that's him. Hey, Josh. Yeah.

630
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:19,970
就接一下米婭 到那大概
Just picking up Mia. We'll be there in like...

631
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:24,280
但是現在我們有了立體音響
But now we got this surround sound setup.

632
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:26,330
噢 就像是在電影院一樣
Oh, it's like being in a movie theater.

633
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,470
嗯 好過電影院音效 真的
Well, better than being in a theater, really.

634
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:30,470
- 真是拭目以待 - 你知道現在的劇院
- I can't wait. - You know theaters these days.

635
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:32,180
- 是的 - 環境很糟糕
- Yeah. - They're so dirty.

636
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:33,970
是的 我知道 烏煙瘴氣的
Yeah, I know. They smell bad.

637
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,530
- 要麼太熱要麼就太冷
- And they're either too hot or too cold.

638
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:37,090
- 我明白 音質真是一落千丈
- I know, the quality has gone far and off.

639
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:39,390
噢 真的很糟糕 總有人在說話
Oh, it's terrible and there's always people talking.

640
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:41,950
- 很多人 - 噢 這
- Many people. - Oh it's...

641
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:44,090
- 抱歉  - 稍等一下
- I'm sorry. Just - hold on a second.

642
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,500
- 你好  - 可能是工作
- Hello? - It's probably work.

643
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,730
抱歉 所以你知道 我們很喜歡
Sorry. So you know, we love it.

644
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:57,780
- 很好 - 你們一定得來
- It's so nice. - Well you have to come.

645
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,820
你真應該過來
You should come by.

646
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:21,310
我還有一個地方要介紹給你 印度尼西亞
I have one more for you man: Indonesia.

647
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:23,210
我不知道 我從沒聽別人說過
I don't know. I never heard anyone say that.

648
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,430
我知道 你知道我都記不清了
I know, you know I can't even keep

649
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:26,250
但是老實說 那真是改變了我的人生
track of it but honestly, it was just life changing.

650
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:27,310
- 真的 - 是的
- Really. - Yeah.

651
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:30,500
很奇妙
Is it amazing?

652
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:33,290
- 是的 - 一個五星級叢林生態度假勝地
- Yes. - A five-star jungle-eco resort.

653
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:35,210
- 你可能不相信 - 棒極了
- Well, you would not believe. - Amazing.

654
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,920
我們本來打算去尼加拉瓜
We were thinking about going to Nicaragua.

655
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:38,750
我覺得尼加拉瓜還不夠發達
I think Nicaragua is less developed.

656
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:40,200
- 甚至有點落後 - 是的
- It's a bit underdeveloped. - Right.

657
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,030
是有一點
It's a little more.

658
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:44,560
我只是 我不知道 我不知道那裏是否安全
I just- I don't know- I don't know if it's safe there.

659
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:47,550
- 是的 是的  - 我不知道是否安全
- Yeah. Yeah. - I don't know if it's safe.

660
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:19,050
對不起
I'm sorry!

661
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:49,520
我有個主意
I have an idea.

662
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,860
那是什麼 劇本嗎
What is that? Is that a script?

663
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:28,920
- 是一個戲劇 - 一個戲劇
- It's a play. - A play?

664
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,200
你最好給我們所有角色
You better give us all roles!

665
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:32,960
事實上 是一個女人的獨角戲
Actually, it's a one woman show.

666
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,880
所以我不能
So I can't.

667
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:42,410
哇 每次都要這樣嗎
Wow. Is that gonna happen everytime?

668
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:44,070
我覺得是
I think so.

669
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,120
等一下 這是單行道
Wait! It's one way.

670
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:39,960
塞巴斯蒂安
Sebastian!

671
01:02:43,810 --> 01:02:46,420
- 凱斯 - 過來 夥計
- Keith. - Come here, man.

672
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:49,950
- 最近怎麼樣 - 很好 夥計
- How are you? - Very good, man.

673
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:52,080
這是米婭 米婭 這是凱斯
This is Mia. Mia, Keith.

674
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:54,160
- 嗨 米婭 很高興見到你 - 很高興見到你
- Hi Mia. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

675
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:55,440
我以前經常和這個傢伙一起演奏
I used to play with this guy.

676
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:57,150
我們以前一起上學
We went to school together.

677
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,320
- 你近來怎麼樣 兄弟 - 很好
- So how you been brother? - Great.

678
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,860
從來都沒這麼好 你呢
Never been better. How about you?

679
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,540
我也非常好 一直很忙
I've been really good. Been very busy.

680
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,220
- 我組建了一個小型樂團 - 很好
- I got a new combo. - Okay.

681
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:05,440
不錯
Cool.

682
01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:06,790
我們在找鍵盤手
We're looking for keys.

683
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:10,070
- 你開玩笑吧 - 不 我是認真的
- Are you kidding me? - No, I'm not kidding.

684
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:12,910
- 算了 我不去了 - 你確定 是付費的哦
- No, I'm good. - You sure? It pays.

685
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,040
我不去了
I'm good.

686
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:16,940
我去拿點喝的
Let's just grab a drink then.

687
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:17,720
真是太長時間不見了
It's been too long.

688
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:20,210
- 好的 很高興見到你米婭 - 很高興見到你
- Okay. Nice to meet you Mia. - Nice to meet you.

689
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:31,850
劇終
The end.

690
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:35,360
這
It's...

691
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,800
太有才了
Genius!

692
01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:40,400
- 真的嗎 - 是的
- Really? - Yes.

693
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:42,000
我感覺這劇真的很懷舊
It feels really nostalgic to me.

694
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:43,180
- 這就是重點 - 是不是太懷舊了
- That's the point. - Is it too nostalgic?

695
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:44,710
- 那是 - 觀眾會喜歡嗎
- That's... - Are people gonna like it?

696
01:03:45,770 --> 01:03:46,770
去他的觀眾
Fuck 'em!

697
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,390
- 你總是這麼說 - 我真的相信
- You always say that. - Well, I truly believe that.

698
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,940
- 我給你做了個東西 - 幹什麼用的
- I made you something. - For what?

699
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:54,920
給你的俱樂部
For your club.

700
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:58,500
為什麼叫seb『s
Why does it say "Seb's"?

701
01:03:58,530 --> 01:03:59,920
因為我覺得應該叫seb『s
Cause I think you should call it "Seb's".

702
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:00,430
什麼
What?

703
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:02,430
因為沒人會願意去雞肉串俱樂部
'Cause no one's gonna come to "Chicken on a Stick".

704
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:04,810
- 這是音符嗎 是單引號嗎 - 是的
- Is that a music note? Is it an apostrophe? - Yes.

705
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:07,230
真的很酷 應該叫做雞肉串
That's pretty cool. It's gotta be "Chicken on a Stick".

706
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:10,390
因為查利 帕克就有個外號
Because Charlie Parker got his nickname...

707
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:11,800
我知道 因為他喜歡雞肉
I know because he loves chicken.

708
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:14,770
這就是為什麼他們叫他大鳥
That's why they call him "Bird".

709
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:18,530
所以我要有雞肉 啤酒 爵士 雞肉串
So I'm gonna have chicken, beer, jazz. "Chicken on a Stick"

710
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:20,200
我知道 我覺得你應該放棄雞肉
I know. I think you should drop the chicken,

711
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:21,480
只要酒水和爵士樂 還有
and just have drinks and jazz, and...

712
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:23,110
- 還可以有  - 我不想放棄雞肉的
- also there could be... - I'm not dropping the chicken.

713
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,800
你也許可以在其他地方做
You could maybe do it somewhere else.

714
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:26,680
比如找一個新地方
Find a new spot?

715
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,850
- 必須是貝克先鋒俱樂部
- It's gotta be the Van Beek.

716
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:29,290
- 不一定非得是貝克先鋒
- It doesn't have to be the Van Beek.

717
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:31,460
我不能讓他們在原來的爵士聖地上盡情的跳桑巴
I can't let them samba all over its history.

718
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:33,190
我不能這麼做
I can't do it.

719
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:37,400
- 他們可以跳的 只是你自己不想讓他們跳罷了 - 你戲劇寫得真好
- You can let them but you refuse to. - Your play's incredible.

720
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:41,830
你知道嗎 整個世界都在你的臥室
You know? The whole world from your bedroom.

721
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:46,210
他們還想要什麼 有誰這麼做了
What else do they want? Who's doing that?

722
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,620
- 我 - 對就是你
- I'm doing that. - You're doing that.

723
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:51,810
燈塔酒吧裏的傢伙是誰
Who was that guy in The Lighthouse?

724
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:55,130
- 給你演出機會的那個人 - 凱斯
- The guy that offered you the gig? - Keith.

725
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,650
是的 你們倆為什麼那麼彆扭呢
Yeah. Why was it so weird between you two?

726
01:04:57,690 --> 01:04:59,900
我跟在一起他一直都這麼彆扭
It's - it's just always weird with him.

727
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:01,270
真的嗎 - 是的
- Really? - Yeah.

728
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:04,660
但是他看起來人還不錯 還給你提供工作
But he seemed kinda nice because he did offer you a job.

729
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:06,770
你會給他打電話嗎
Are you gonna call him?

730
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,780
- 不 不 - 好吧
- No. No. - All right.

731
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,380
所以
So...

732
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:16,100
- 我們達成共識 - 嗯
- Here's what we know. - Yeah.

733
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:19,170
一定得叫 雞肉串
It's definitely "Chicken on a Stick"...

734
01:05:20,670 --> 01:05:22,590
你的表演一定會成功的
and your play's gonna be a triumph.

735
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,310
是一個女人的獨角戲
It's a one woman show.

736
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,280
所以只有我一個
So it's just me.

737
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:30,160
不 我的意思是我會出演
No, I mean I'm acting in it.

738
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:35,990
不是 媽媽 沒有報酬 我要出錢來做
No, Mom, I'm not getting paid. I'm paying to do it.

739
01:05:38,130 --> 01:05:40,590
他很好 他準備開自己的爵士俱樂部
He's great. He's gonna open his own jazz club.

740
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:42,240
是的 一定會很棒
Yeah, it's gonna be incredible.

741
01:05:45,330 --> 01:05:47,890
呃 不 他 他還沒成名 他需要
Uh no. He's - he's nobody yet. He needs um..

742
01:05:52,310 --> 01:05:53,920
他在存錢 我覺得
He's saving up, I think.

743
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:02,060
不 他還沒有固定的演出
No but he doesn't have a steady gig.

744
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:03,200
但是他會搞定的
But he's figuring it out.

745
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:05,020
最近有點亂
It's just been a little too gilly lately.

746
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,650
媽媽 他會想辦法把俱樂部開起來的 你一定會喜歡的
Mom, he's gonna find a way to open it and you're gonna love it.

747
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:12,430
好嗎
Okay?

748
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:13,470
爸爸怎麼樣了
How's Dad?

749
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:24,580
塞巴斯蒂安 進來 夥計
Sebastian. Come on in, man.

750
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:28,030
- 感謝你能來 - 謝謝你邀請我
- Thanks for coming. - Thanks for having me.

751
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:29,550
沒想到今天能見到你
I wasn't sure I'd see you today.

752
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:32,580
計劃是這樣的 好
- So here's the deal. - Okay.

753
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:35,440
我們和環球有發行合作 會有自己的專輯
We got distribution with Universal. We got our own imprint.

754
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:37,010
也會有路演
We're about to go on the road.

755
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:39,210
我們會付你周薪一千美金
We can pay you a thousand bucks a week...

756
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:43,120
加上門票和專輯銷售分紅 聽起來怎麼樣
plus a cut of the ticket revenue and merchandising. Sound good?

757
01:06:46,590 --> 01:06:47,590
- 塞巴斯蒂安 - 嗯
- Sebastian? - Yup.

758
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:48,650
可以嗎
All right.

759
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:50,180
那我們開始吧 好的
- Let's play. - Okay.

760
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:49,890
我知道 這風格迥異
I know. It's different.

761
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:53,980
你說你想拯救爵士
But you say you want to save jazz.

762
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:56,950
如果沒人聽爵士你拿什麼來拯救它
How are you gonna save jazz if no one's listening?

763
01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:59,610
就是因為像你這樣的人才導致爵士樂的衰亡
Jazz is dying because of people like you.

764
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:03,490
你演奏的是燈塔酒吧裏那種老式90年代的腔調
You play into 90 year olds at The Lighthouse.

765
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,110
小孩子們呢 年輕人呢
Where are the kids? Where are the young people?

766
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:10,920
你對肯尼克 拉克和塞隆尼斯 蒙克如此著迷
You're so obsessed with Kenny Clarke and Thelonious Monk.

767
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:12,890
這些人都是革命者
These guys were revolutionaries.

768
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:15,150
如果你自己就是個保守派
How are you going to be a revolutionary,

769
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:16,710
你要怎麼成為革命者
if you're such a traditionalist?

770
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:20,860
你過於執著於往昔 而爵士是關於未來
You holding on to the past, but jazz is about the future.

771
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:30,580
我懂你 我還認識一個鍵盤手 他沒你優秀
I know. The other guy, he wasn't as good as you.

772
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:34,450
但你太糾結了 兄弟
But you're a pain in the ass, man.

773
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:21,350
#繁星之城 你是否唯我一人閃耀
#City of stars Are you shining just for me?

774
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:31,080
#繁星之城 如此之多迷亂我的眼眸
#City of stars There's so much that I can't see

775
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:35,590
#又有何人知曉
#Who knows?

776
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:42,180
#從我第一次與你相擁 就已感知這美好
#I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you

777
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:50,020
#如今我們美夢成真
#That now our dreams they've finally come true

778
01:09:53,470 --> 01:09:56,110
#繁星之城
#City of stars

779

#無數人所追逐的就是
#Just one thing everybody wants

780
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:05,080
#在燈紅酒綠之中
#There in the bars

781
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:06,800
#穿過擁擠餐廳
#And through the smokescreen

782
01:10:06,850 --> 01:10:10,630
#透過繚繞煙幕
#Of the crowded restaurants

783
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:13,860
#這就是愛
#It's love

784
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:19,960
#是啊 每個人都在尋求他人的愛意
#Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else

785
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:22,790
- #一次衝動 - #一個眼神
- #A rush - #A glance

786
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,710
- #一次觸碰 - #一曲舞蹈
- #A touch - #A dance

787
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,300
#一個眼神明了心意
#A look in somebody's eyes

788
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:30,390
#點亮星空
#To light up the skies

789
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,630
#展開世界的畫捲滾動在你眼前
#To open the world and send it reeling

790
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:39,270
#一個聲音說道 你我相會再此
#A voice that says, "I'll be here and you'll be alright

791
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:47,560
#我不在意我將會去往何方
#I don't care if I know just where I will go

792
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:50,780
#因為此刻我只需擁有這美妙的感覺
#'Cause all that I need's this crazy feeling

793
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,490
#蠢蠢欲動的心
#The rat-tat-tat on my heart

794
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:58,120
#我只希望此刻永駐
#I think I want it to stay

795
01:12:48,810 --> 01:12:55,710
#繁星之城 你是否為我一人閃耀
#City of stars Are you shining just for me?

796
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,450
#繁星之城
#City of stars

797
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:09,460
#你從未如此閃耀

798
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:42,390
#我不知道為何舞動身姿

01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:52,680
#我不知道是否是節奏或許只是瘋魔
#I don』t know if there`s a beat, or somethinga`s taking over me

804
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,350
#佔據思緒的是

#我想嘗試的事情
#I wanna try

806
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:18,950
#不知你為何到來 但我瞭解我心中所想

807
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:20,240

#你知道嗎 這感覺如此美好
#Don't you know I feel so good

819
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:05,290
情緒正酣 氣氛正濃

839
01:16:55,390 --> 01:16:56,500
嗨 是我
Hey, it's me.

840
01:16:57,370 --> 01:16:59,490
我不確定你現在在哪裏 可能在波士頓
I'm not sure where you are right now. I think Boston.

841
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:02,150
也可能是達拉斯 我不確定
Maybe Dallas, I don't know.

842
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,980
最近都沒怎麼聯繫了
I haven't heard from you in a little while...

843
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:10,250
我很想你
And I miss you.

844
01:17:12,410 --> 01:17:13,580
就這樣 拜
All right bye.

845
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,160
我以為
I thought...

846
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:53,800
驚喜
Surprise!

847
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,380
我明天要一大早離開 但我就是
I gotta leave first thing in the morning, but I just...

848
01:17:58,580 --> 01:17:59,800
想見到你
I had to see you.

849
01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:06,700
回家了真高興
It's so nice to be home.

850
01:18:09,770 --> 01:18:11,120
我也很高興你回來
I'm so glad you're home.

851
01:18:13,950 --> 01:18:15,020
演出怎麼樣
How's the play going?

852
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:17,840
我很緊張
I'm nervous.

853
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:19,420
怎麼會 為什麼
You are? Why?

854
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:22,780
- 因為 如果觀眾真的來現場  - 不要管他
- Because... what if people show up? - Pishi kaka.

855
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:25,190
你真的那麼在意觀眾的看法嗎
You're nervous about what they think?

856
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:27,440
我真的很緊張
I'm nervous to do it.

857
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:29,820
很緊張站在台上
I'm nervous to get up on that stage...

858
01:18:29,850 --> 01:18:30,660
為觀眾演出
and perform for people.

859
01:18:30,690 --> 01:18:32,010
我是說這些都不必要
I mean, I don't need to say that to you.

860
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:35,460
這場演出肯定驚艷四座 你不懂我很怕
- It's gonna be incredible. - You don't get it but I'm terrified.

861
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:39,300
能觀賞演出是他們的榮幸 我迫不及待了
They should be lucky to see it. I can't wait.

862
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:40,890
可我想等
I can.

863
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:44,800
你明天什麼時候離開 早上嗎
When do you leave? In the morning?

864
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:49,220
45分走 去博伊西（美國愛達荷州首府）
45. Boise.

865
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:51,660
- 要去博伊西 - 是的
- Boise? - Boise.

866
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:53,570
敬博伊西
To Boise!

867
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:57,920
你也應該來
You should come.

868
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:00,790
去博伊西
To Boise?

869
01:19:00,990 --> 01:19:02,700
這樣就完成了你又一項心願清單
Yeah. You can knock it off your bucket list.

870
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:06,310
哦 那相當不錯嘛 我也想去啊
Oh. That would be really exciting. I wish I could.

871
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:08,030
那之後你準備去哪兒
What are you doing after the tour?

872
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:10,450
你為什麼不來
Why can't you?

873
01:19:10,930 --> 01:19:12,170
- 去博伊西 - 沒錯
- Come to Boise? - Yeah.

874
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:13,280
因為我還要排練
'Cause I have to rehearse.

875
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:15,270
難道不可以去其他地方排練嗎
Yeah but can't you rehearse anywhere?

876
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:20,620
其他你在的地方
Anywhere you are?

877
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:23,570
我是說 - 沒錯
I mean - I guess.

878
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:27,550
好吧 我的道具什麼的都在這裏 而且只有兩星期了
Well, all my stuff is here and it's in two weeks.

879
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:29,440
所以我覺得這可能不是個
So I don't think really think that would be...

880
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:31,800
好吧
Okay.

881
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:34,570
- 最好的決定 不過 - 好吧
- the best idea right now, but... - Right.

882
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:36,480
我希望我能去
I wish I could.

883
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:39,430
現在我們必須努力然後見到對方
We're just gonna have to try and see each other,

884
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:40,680
你知道的 才能見到對方
you know, so that we see each other.

885
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:42,410
我知道 不過你什麼時候結束這個
I know but when are you done?

886
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:44,770
你什麼意思 我是說
What do you mean? I mean...

887
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:47,830
什麼時候結束巡迴演出
When you're finish with the whole tour?

888
01:19:48,490 --> 01:19:50,420
結束以後 我們會去錄音
After we finish, we're gonna go to recording

889
01:19:50,450 --> 01:19:51,930
接著我們再去巡迴演出
and then we'll go back on tour.

890
01:19:52,710 --> 01:19:54,340
你知道的 我們巡迴演出才能接著出唱片
You know, we tour so we can make the records...

891
01:19:54,430 --> 01:19:55,980
然後我們再去巡迴演出再出唱片
so we can go back to tour the record.

892
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:01,850
所以這就像持久戰
So it's like the long haul?

893
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:06,940
你說 持久戰 什麼意思
What do you mean the "Long haul"?

894
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:10,610
我說持久戰的意思是你得待在這個樂隊裏
I mean the long haul that you're gonna stay in this band...

895
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:11,840
一直巡迴演出
for a long time.

896
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:14,450
就像一場持久戰
On tour.

897
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:18,380
那你本以為我要做什麼
I mean, what did you think I was going to do?

898
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:19,730
我不
I don't...

899
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,250
我沒想過這件事
I hadn't really thought it through.

900
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:22,530
我不知道你們樂隊
I didn't know that the band...

901
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:25,820
- 你沒想過我們會火起來 - 有那麼重要
- You didn't think we would be successful. - would be important.

902
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:32,870
不 我不是那麼認為的 我只是覺得你
No, that's not really what I mean. I just mean that y-you...

903
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:36,120
我是說 你會巡迴演出多久 幾個月 幾年
I mean... You'll be on tour for what? Months now? Years?

904
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:38,280
我沒這麼說 我覺得
Yeah I don't mean - this is it...

905
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,150
我這麼做是可行的
I mean, this is- it could feasibly be- yeah for..

906
01:20:40,290 --> 01:20:42,050
我可以靠著這一張唱片
I could be on tour with this...

907
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:44,480
一直巡迴演出至少幾年
For a couple of years at least, just this record.

908
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,010
你喜歡你現在彈的音樂嗎
Do you like the music you're playing?

909
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:51,740
我不
I don't...

910
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:55,500
我不知道這 這有什麼關係
I don't know... what - what it matters.

911
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:57,720
有關係 因為這
Well, it matters because...

912
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:00,450
關係到你是不是已經放棄夢想了 我覺得
if you're going to give up your dream. I think it matters...

913
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,340
你會不會喜歡自己幾年內將會彈奏的音樂
that you like what you're playing

914
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:04,200
這件事很重要
on the road for years.

915
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:08,310
你喜歡我的音樂嗎
Do you like the music that I play?

916
01:21:08,350 --> 01:21:09,480
當然
Yeah.

917
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:12,460
我喜歡
I do.

918
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:14,180
我只是覺得你自己不喜歡
I just didn't think that you did.

919
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:15,410
好吧
Yeah well...

920
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,030
你知道的 你說過凱斯是最糟的
You know, you said Keith is the worst

921
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:18,260
但是現在你要
And now you're gonna be on

922
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:20,300
跟著他巡迴演出幾年 所以我不知道
tour with him for years, so I just didn't...

923
01:21:20,330 --> 01:21:21,350
- 我不清楚你現在是在做什麼
- I don't know what are you doing right now?

924
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:21,920
-你是不是真的開心
- know if you were happy.

925
01:21:21,950 --> 01:21:22,780
你為什麼這麼做
Why are you doing this?

926
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:24,010
我不 你為什麼這麼質疑我
I don't... What do you mean "Why are you doing this"?

927
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,130
我以為你想要我做這個
I thought you wanted me to do this

928
01:21:25,330 --> 01:21:26,820
但是現在聽起來你不是這樣想的
and it just sounds like now you don't want me to do it.

929
01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:29,030
什麼叫 我想讓你做的
What do you mean I wanted you to do this?

930
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:31,150
這就是你想讓我做的
This is what you wanted for me.

931
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,140
在這個樂隊裏
To be in this band?

932
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:35,690
在一個樂隊裏 有一份固定的工作 你知道的
To be in a band to have a steady job. You know.

933
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:38,270
能 能夠 你懂的
T- to be... you know.

934
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,450
當然了 我希望你有一份固定的工作
Of course, I wanted you to have a steady job...

935
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:42,620
這樣你可以照顧好自己
so that you can take care of

936
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:44,560
對生活負責 然後你可以開自己的俱樂部
yourself and your life and you could start your club.

937
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,650
對啊 我就是在這麼啊
Yes so I'm doing that so I don't

938
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:47,170
我不明白 我們難道不是在慶祝這個嗎
understand - I mean why aren't we celebrating?

939
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:48,730
為什麼你不開你的俱樂部了
Why aren't you starting your club?

940
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:51,560
你自己說過沒人想去那裏
You said yourself no one wants to go to that club.

941
01:21:51,860 --> 01:21:53,870
沒人想去什麼雞肉串俱樂部
No one wants to go to a club called "Chicken on a Stick".

942
01:21:53,890 --> 01:21:54,890
那換個名字啊
So change the name!

943
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:57,340
沒有人喜歡爵士樂 連你都不喜歡
Well, no one likes jazz! Not even you!

944
01:21:57,510 --> 01:21:59,140
我現在因為你喜歡爵士了
I do like jazz now because of you!

945
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:00,980
這就是我以為的你想讓我做的工作
And this is what I thought you wanted me to do!

946
01:22:01,770 --> 01:22:04,920
那我應該怎麼做呢 回去彈聖誕歌嗎
What am I supposed to do? Go back to playing Jingle Bells?

947
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,480
我不是這個意思 我是說為什麼你不帶著
I'm not saying that! I'm saying why don't you take...

948
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:07,800
一點點地攢著小錢
Scrutting pennies so I can...

949
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:08,600
- 你的成果然後開俱樂部呢
- what you've made and start the club!

950
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:09,390
- 開一個人人都不去的俱樂部嗎
- start a club that no one wants to go?

951
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:11,410
人們會想去的
People will wanna go to it...

952
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,040
因為你對它有熱情
because you're passionate about it...

953
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:15,490
而且人們喜歡看到別人付出激情的演出
and people love what other people are passionate about.

954
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:16,920
你能夠讓別人想到他們已經忘記的事情
You remind people of what they've forgotten.

955
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:18,120
我自己都不信
Not in my experience.

956
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:24,630
好吧 不管怎樣 現在是時候長大了
Well, whatever alright. It's - it's time to grow up, you know.

957
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:27,130
我有穩定的工作 這就是我要做的事
I have a steady job, this is what I'm doing.

958
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,180
現在你突然提出來這些問題
And now all of a sudden if you had these problems,

959
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:31,150
你應該在我簽完該死的名
I wish you would've said them earlier...

960
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:32,640
之前就把這些說出來
Before I signed on the goddamn dotted line!

961
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:33,890
我的重點是 你有一個
I'm pointing out that you had a

962
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:35,860
追逐過的夢想 你一直堅持的
dream that you followed, that you were sticking...

963
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:38,210
這就是我的夢想 這就是夢想
This is the dream! This is the dream!

964
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:39,930
- 這不是你的夢想 - 像我這樣的人
- This is not your dream! - Guys like me...

965
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:42,630
要付出一生的努力來變成別人稱讚的
work their whole lives to be in something that's successful,

966
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:44,630
成功人士 你懂嗎
that people like. You know?

967
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:48,970
我是說 我總算變成了別人欣賞的那 那 那種人
I mean, I'm finally in something th-th-th-th-that people enjoy.

968
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,490
從什麼時候你開始介意別人的喜好了
Since when do you care about being liked?

969
01:22:50,690 --> 01:22:52,170
如果只是我不喜歡做 那不重要
Just because I don't enjoy it, it doesn't matter.

970
01:22:52,210 --> 01:22:53,960
為什麼你會這麼在意別人喜不喜歡你
Why do you care so much you about being liked?

971
01:22:53,990 --> 01:22:56,290
你只是個演員 你憑什麼這麼說我
You are an actress! What are you talking about?

972
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:16,010
也許你只是喜歡我最不好的時候
Maybe you just liked me when I was on my ass...

973
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:18,120
因為那會讓你自我感覺良好
because it made you feel better about yourself.

974
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:24,570
- 你是在開玩笑嗎 - 不是
- Are you kidding? - No.

975
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:47,300
我也不懂
I don't know...

976
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:09,850
好吧夥計們 明天再見
Okay fellas. I'll - see you tomorrow.

977
01:25:09,870 --> 01:25:11,230

- Sebastian? - Yeah?

978
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:12,520
你今晚你可以來的吧
You're good for tonight, right?

979
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,760
- 你在說什麼呢 - 7點 雜誌社的

982
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:30,370
你可以嗎
Is that okay?

983
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,080
- 湯婭 給我另一隻相機 - 出什麼問題了嗎
- Tonya, give me the other camera! - What's wrong with that?

984
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:30,430
出什麼問題了嗎 我也不知道啊
"What's wrong with that"? Oh I don't know

985
01:26:30,630 --> 01:26:31,910
它不工作了 這就是問題
It does not bloody work! That's what's wrong with it!

986
01:26:32,610 --> 01:26:34,180
很好鼓手 這樣很棒
Alright trumpet, that's lovely!

987

很棒 很棒 就這樣

太棒啦 美極了
That is lovely! That's lovely.

992
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:52,130
好 看我 現在像這樣咬下嘴唇
Okay, now look. Now bite your lip like this...

993
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:54,140
就像在專注一件事的感覺
like you're concentrating on something,

994
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:56,160
我也不好說 比如專注於你的音樂吧
I don't know, like a piece of your music.

995
01:26:56,430 --> 01:26:58,680
- 咬什麼 - 你的嘴唇 咬嘴唇
- Bite my what? - Your lip. Bite your lip.

996

Beautiful.

998
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:08,280
好的 現在 把眼鏡往鼻子下面滑一點
Okay. Now, just move your glasses down on your nose.

999
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:10,600
再低點 就一點點
A little bit further. Just a little bit touch further.

1000
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:14,280
頭低著 但抬眼看我 帶點兒憂鬱氣質
Keep your head down, but look up at me. Look sort of moody.

1001
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:17,110
對 真是美極了 非常棒

1004
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:23,310
- 不 現在不用咬嘴唇了
- No. You don't have to bite your lip now.

1005
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:25,790
那個 你得彈點什麼出來
Well, you should play something.

1006
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:28,930
彈點東西 你懂的 什麼都行
Play something, you know. Anything.

1007
01:27:29,230 --> 01:27:30,900
你不是鋼琴家嘛 彈點什麼
You're pianist, aren't you? Play something.

That's great! That's beautiful. That's lovely. Oh, that's good.

別停 繼續彈
Now, don't stop. Keep playing.

1010
01:27:50,210 --> 01:27:52,730
來啊 繼續彈 非常棒
Come on, just keep playing. That was great!

1011
01:28:32,410 --> 01:28:33,950
一槍崩了我算了
Shoot myself in the head.

1012
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:39,010
她連一般都算不上 還有窗戶那出
She's not even good. And the window thing...

1014
01:28:40,850 --> 01:28:42,260
她把窗戶怎麼了
What did she do with the window?

1015
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:44,250
噢老天 千萬別把正經工作辭掉
Oh my God! Don't quit your day job.

1016
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:45,760

所有這些
All of this.

1029
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:55,540
我受夠一直讓自己難堪 我受夠了 受夠了
I'm done embarrassing myself. I'm done. I'm done.

1030
01:29:56,620 --> 01:29:57,960
- 根本沒人來 - 那又怎樣
- Nobody showed up. - So what?

1031
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:00,050
劇場的錢我都出不起 這實在是
I can't pay back the theater! This is so...

1032
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:03,560

- 這就是你的家啊 - 不 再也不是了
- This is home. - No, it's not anymore.

- You have to be quiet. - If you want me to be quiet..

1062
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:55,230
- 鄰居們要被你吵起來了 - 你得講點道理
- You're gonna wake up the neighbors. - you have to make sense.

1063
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:55,970
你要是想讓我小聲點
If you want me to be quiet,

你先給我他娘的說清楚是為什麼

他們會報警的
They're gonna call the police.

1066
01:33:58,540 --> 01:33:59,210
因為 因為
Because - because...

1067
01:33:59,270 --> 01:34:00,250
我去過了百八十萬個
I've been to a million of

1068
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:02,130
大大小小的試鏡可結果都是一個德性
auditions and the same thing happens every time!

1069
01:34:02,210 --> 01:34:04,920
人們打斷我就因為他們想吃個三明治
Where I get interrupted because someone wants to get a sandwich!

1070
01:34:04,950 --> 01:34:07,770
要不就是我哭的時候他們卻笑了
Or I'm crying and they start laughing!

1071
01:34:07,870 --> 01:34:09,780
再不就是等在接待室裏的那些人
Or there's people sitting in the waiting room...

1072
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:10,980
她們她們
and they're and they're...

1073
01:34:11,010 --> 01:34:12,820
像我 但比我更漂亮
like me but prettier...

1074
01:34:12,860 --> 01:34:15,510
也比我更 或許只是因為我不夠好
and better at the - because maybe I'm not good enough!

1075
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,400
- 不 你很好 - 不
- Yes, you are. - No.

1076
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:22,240
- 或許我不好 - 你很好
- Maybe I'm not. - You are.

1077
01:34:25,110 --> 01:34:29,000
或許我和那些一心想做一件事的人一樣
Maybe I'm one of those people who always wanted to do it...

1078
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:32,300
但對我來說這就像個白日夢 你懂嗎
but it's like a pipe dream for me, you know?

1079
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:36,380
你說過的 換個夢想人就長大了
You said it: You change your dreams and then you grow up.

1080
01:34:36,410 --> 01:34:38,920
或許這說的就是我 注定不是我
Maybe I'm one of those people and I'm not supposed to.

1081
01:34:38,990 --> 01:34:40,540
我可以回學校
And I can go back to school

1082
01:34:40,540 --> 01:34:43,310
換個別的注定該是我做的事
and find something else that I'm supposed to do.

1083
01:34:43,410 --> 01:34:46,060
因為我已經告別了所有這些東西
'Cause I left to do that...

1084
01:34:46,110 --> 01:34:48,790
六年了 我不想再做下去了
and it's been six years and I don't wanna do it anymore.

1085
01:34:52,550 --> 01:34:53,710
理由呢
Why?

1086
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:58,930
- 什麼理由 - 你不想再做下去的理由
- Why what? - Why don't you wanna do it anymore?

1087
01:35:01,150 --> 01:35:03,300
因為我覺得它傷我有點深
Because I think it hurts a little bit too much.

1088
01:35:05,930 --> 01:35:07,040
你就是個小孩
You're a baby.

1089
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:09,930
- 我不是小孩 我正在努力成長
- I'm not a baby. I'm trying to grow up.

1090
01:35:09,930 --> 01:35:11,190
- 你就是 你哭得像個小孩兒
- You are. You're crying like a baby.

1091
01:35:11,220 --> 01:35:11,960
噢老天
Oh my God!

1092
01:35:11,990 --> 01:35:14,040
你明天5:30試鏡
And you have an audition tomorrow at 5:30.

1093
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:16,780
我明早8:00到
I'll be out front at 8:00 am.

1094
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:19,940
至於你來不來 全在你
You'll be out front or not. I don't know.

1095
01:35:21,820 --> 01:35:23,150
你怎麼找到這兒來的
How did you find me here?

1096
01:35:24,530 --> 01:35:25,850
圖書館正對的這棟房
The house in front of the library.

1097
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:11,500
- 我買了咖啡 - 好 行
- I got coffee. - Okay, great.

1098
01:36:30,170 --> 01:36:31,170
米婭
Mia?

1099
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:39,500
嗨 米婭 我是艾米 這位是弗蘭克
Hi, Mia. I'm Amy and this is Frank.

1100
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,600
- 嗨 你好嗎 - 很高興見到你
- Hi, how are you? - Pleasure to meet you.

1101
01:36:41,740 --> 01:36:43,810
- 很高興找到了你 - 我也很高興
- I'm glad we found you. - Me too.

1102
01:36:45,730 --> 01:36:49,420
這部電影將在巴黎拍攝 而我們沒有劇本
The film shoots in Paris and we don't have a script.

1103
01:36:51,230 --> 01:36:52,330
拍這劇是個逐漸的過程
It's gonna be a process.

1104
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:54,690
我們會圍繞女主角創造角色
We're gonna build the character around the actress.

1105
01:36:54,710 --> 01:36:56,900
有三個月的預演和四個月的正式拍攝
It's a three-month rehearsal and a four-month shoot.

1106
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,440
好吧
Okay.

1107
01:37:01,460 --> 01:37:04,220
還有我們覺著你可以給我們講個故事
And we thought you could just tell us a story.

1108
01:37:04,990 --> 01:37:07,850
- 關於 - 關於什麼都行
- About? - Just tell us anything.

1109
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:09,960
什麼都行
Anything?

1110
01:37:09,970 --> 01:37:12,170
是的 講個故事 你不是很會講故事嗎
Yes. Tell us a story. You're a storyteller.

1111
01:37:18,070 --> 01:37:19,120
準備好就可以開始了
Whenever you're ready.

1112
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:31,850
我姑姑曾在巴黎住過
My aunt used to live in Paris.

1113
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:39,380
我記得 她曾回來給我們講一些故事
I remember, she used to come home and she would tell us...

1114
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:43,700
一些在國外生活的故事
These stories about being abroad and...

1115
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:51,240
我記得她說過 她有一次跳河了
I remember she told us that she jumped into the river once...

1116
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:54,720
光著雙腳
Barefoot.

1117
01:37:56,850 --> 01:37:58,100
面帶微笑
She smiled...

1118
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:01,060
#縱身一躍
#Leapt...

1119
01:38:01,930 --> 01:38:03,570
#毫不猶豫
#Without looking

1120
01:38:07,050 --> 01:38:11,770
#就跳進了
#And tumbled into...

1121
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:14,000
#塞納河
#The Seine

1122
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:20,610
#河水冰涼刺骨
#The water was freezing

1123
01:38:21,220 --> 01:38:24,610
#整月修養 噴嚏不斷
#She spent a month sneezing

1124
01:38:25,570 --> 01:38:30,410
#但是她還說 還會再次跳河
#But said she would do it again

1125
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:39,010
#那些身懷夢想的人們
#Here's to the ones who dream

1126
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:46,900
#也許看起來比較傻笨
#Foolish as they may seem

1127
01:38:48,690 --> 01:38:54,820
#這首歌獻給那些隱隱作痛的心
#Here's to the hearts that ache

1128
01:38:56,260 --> 01:39:02,120
#這首歌致敬那些我們製造的小混亂
#Here's to the mess we make

1129
01:39:04,030 --> 01:39:09,350
#她捕捉到一種情緒 在不被天花板遮擋住的天空下
#She captured a feeling Sky with no ceiling

1130
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:14,290
#像定格在油畫板上那樣美麗的夕陽
#The sunset inside a frame

1131
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:22,440
#她抿著最愛的小酒  彈指間生命消逝
#She lived in her liquor And died with a flicker

1132
01:39:22,970 --> 01:39:27,200
#但我將永遠銘記這火熱的光芒
#I'll always remember the flame

1133
01:39:29,390 --> 01:39:35,020
#那些身懷夢想的人們
#Here's to the ones who dream

1134
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:41,010
#也許看起來比較傻笨

1135
01:39:41,660 --> 01:39:47,070
#這首歌獻給那些隱隱作痛的心
#Here's to the hearts that ache

1136
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:51,960
#這首歌致敬那些我們製造的小混亂
#Here's to the mess we made

1137
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,730
#她告訴過我
#She told me...

1138
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:58,330
#一點點瘋狂 是為漫漫人生
#"A bit of madeness is key"

1139
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:03,000
#添姿加色的靈藥
#"To give us new colors to see"

1140
01:40:04,570 --> 01:40:08,920
#誰知前路何方
#"Who knows where it will lead us?"

1141
01:40:09,210 --> 01:40:13,190
#這就是為何世界需要我們

1142
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:17,050
#帶領著叛逆者們
#So bring on the rebels

1143
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:19,330
#遊樂在鵝卵石打出的小小漣漪中
#The ripples from pebbles

1144
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:23,750
#畫家 詩人還有演員

1145
01:40:24,090 --> 01:40:30,660
#這首歌獻給那些身懷夢想的傻瓜
#And here's to the fools who dream

1146
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:35,690
#儘管他們看起來特別瘋狂
#Crazy as they may seem

1147
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:40,920
#這首歌獻給那些易碎的心
#Here's to the hearts that break

1148
01:40:40,980 --> 01:40:46,860
#這首歌致敬那些我們製造的小混亂
#Here's to the mess we made

1149
01:40:50,590 --> 01:40:55,880
#我會追隨這些斑駁痕跡
#I trace it all back to then

1150
01:40:58,660 --> 01:41:03,640
#她 這雪 以及塞納河
#Her, and the snow, and the Seine

1151
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:11,330
#始終面帶微笑
#Smiling trough it

1152
01:41:12,170 --> 01:41:16,530
#她說還會再次
#She said she'd do it

1153
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:20,550
#跳河
#Again

1154
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:36,370
你什麼時候會收到結果
When do you find out?

1155
01:41:37,870 --> 01:41:39,410
他們說接下來幾天就會告訴我
They said the next couple of days.

1156
01:41:40,110 --> 01:41:42,820
但是我不想指望任何結果
But I'm not expecting to find anything out.

1157
01:41:42,860 --> 01:41:44,850
- 你會通過的 - 我很可能不會
- You're gonna get it. - I really might not.

1158
01:41:44,860 --> 01:41:46,430
- 你會通過的 - 我不想使希望變成失望
- Yes, you are. - I don't want to be disappointed.

1159
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:47,500
我瞭解
I know.

1160
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:50,400
我瞭解 我瞭解這些事情
I know. I know these things.

1161
01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:54,350
我們在哪裏
Where we are?

1162
01:41:58,070 --> 01:41:58,700
格裏菲斯公園
Griffith Park.

1163
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:01,430
- 我們之間怎麼辦 - 我知道
- Where are we? - I know.

1164
01:42:03,950 --> 01:42:05,020
我不知道
I don't know.

1165
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:09,350
我們要怎麼辦
What do we do?

1166
01:42:10,690 --> 01:42:14,980
我們現在什麼也做不了 因為當你得到這次機會時
I don't think we could do anything, because when you get this...

1167
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:17,280
- 如果我得到的話 - 當你得到時
- If I get this. - When you get this...

1168
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:21,300
你必須拋開一切 竭盡全力地努力
You gotta give it everything you got.

1169
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:26,110
竭盡全力 這是你的夢想
Everything. It's your dream.

1170
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:28,220
那你要做什麼呢
What are you gonna do?

1171
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,830
我會按照我自己計劃來 你知道嗎
I gotta follow my own plan. You know?

1172
01:42:30,910 --> 01:42:33,700
留下並努力做好一切
Stay here and get my own thing going.

1173
01:42:39,330 --> 01:42:42,280
你到時候會在巴黎 巴黎的爵士樂非常不錯
You'll be in Paris. Good jazz there.

1174
01:42:43,530 --> 01:42:44,890
現在你也喜歡爵士樂了
And you love jazz now.

1175
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:48,280
對吧
Right?

1176
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:51,010
是的
Yes.

1177
01:43:00,770 --> 01:43:03,010
我猜我們只能讓時間來見分曉了
I guess we're just gonna have to wait and see.

1178
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:13,630
我會一直愛著你
I'll always gonna love you.

1179
01:43:15,650 --> 01:43:17,270
我也會一直愛著你
I'll always gonna love you too.

1180
01:43:25,310 --> 01:43:26,470
看看這景色
Look at this view!

1181
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:29,820
我見過更好的
I've seen better.

1182
01:43:29,870 --> 01:43:30,920
- 這難看死了 - 是呀
- It's the worst. - Yeah.

1183
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:32,150
嗯
Yeah.

1184
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:37,450
我白天從來沒有來到這裏過
I've never been here during the day.

1185
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:32,940
- 你好 能給我兩杯冰咖啡嗎 謝謝 - 好的 當然
- Hi. Can I have two iced coffees, please. - Right. Of course.

1186
01:44:33,050 --> 01:44:36,260
- 我們請了 - 不用了 謝謝 我還是自己付吧
- On us. - Oh, no thank you. I insist.

1187
01:45:06,350 --> 01:45:09,430
音色聽起來不錯 哈里斯幹得不錯
Sounds good. Harris did a good job.

1188
01:45:10,530 --> 01:45:11,420
讓他花了好長時間
It took him long enough.

1189
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:13,960
他總是這樣 簽個字吧
He always does. Signature time.

1190
01:45:16,950 --> 01:45:18,340
你幹得還不錯 賽巴
It's not doing too bad, Seb.

1191
01:45:18,850 --> 01:45:20,140
還不錯就是很棒啦
"Not too bad" Is great.

1192
01:45:20,730 --> 01:45:22,650
- 晚上見 - 晚上見
- See you tonight. - See you tonight.

1193
01:45:43,740 --> 01:45:44,740
