- Happy Birthday! - Hey, birthday cake!

20
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,030
-我來了  -謝謝
- There I am. - Thank you.

21
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,090
真不錯
That's nice!

22
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,420
這張拍得不錯啊
That's actually a really good one.

23
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,870
有人想吃這個嗎
Wait, anybody wants this?

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,880
出于同情邀請人家過來  就會變成這樣
That's what happens when you do a mercy invite.

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,810
我覺得你是想邀請所有人
I believed you wanted to invite everyone.

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,320
爸  我不能請了藝術課上的每一個人
Dad, I can't invite everyone in my art class

27
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,490
卻不請那個幾乎不與其他人來往的人
except for one person without social networking evidence,

28
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,640
我并不想讓她更加痛苦
inflicting more pain on that person than was intended.

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,680
-我又不是什么怪物  -我真為你驕傲
- And I'm not a monster. - I'm proud of you, I think.

30
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,350
她常被留校反省  有時候還會沖老師吼
She gets detention a lot, and she yells at teachers sometimes.

31
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,200
之后有傳言說
Then there was that rumor that went around

32
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,300
她不斷地離家出走
that she just kept running away from home.

33
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,290
也許她可以叫個優步
Maybe she can Uber.

34
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,980
我真覺得我們現在該回家了
I seriously believe that we can go home now.

35
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,740
是我用詞不當讓你們覺得這是民主投票嗎
Did I mistakenly convey this was a democracy?

36
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,140
等有人來接她了  我們再走
We are not going till she gets picked up.

37
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,420
車拋錨了  我坐公交車回去
The car broke down. I'm just gonna take the bus.

38
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,370
你別坐公交車  我開車送你回去
You're not taking a bus, I'll drive you home.

39
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,190
克萊爾幾乎已經攢下了
Claire has almost saved her half of the money

40
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,450
買車需要的一半的錢了  不是嗎
she needs for her car. Isn't that right?

41
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,220
這是最后僅有的幾次
And this will be one of the few times left

42
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,970
我載你們一程的機會了
I can drive you guys around.

43
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:04,990
我...
I'm...

44
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,420
你之后就再聽不到我爸全程都說著
You won't be able to hear my dad tell jokes that only he thinks

45
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,440
只有他覺得好笑的笑話了  一起來吧
are funny for an entire car ride unless you come.

46
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,580
你不會想錯過的
You don't really wanna miss that.

47
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,230
我收到的禮物比我想得要多
I got more gifts than I thought I did.

48
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,000
我能把這個放這里嗎
Can I put this in here?

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,400
當然  我來  謝謝  瑪西亞
Yeah, I'll get it. Thank you, Marcia.

50
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,670
也許他只是喜歡...
Maybe he just is into...

51
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:34,520
也許他只是安于現狀而已
Maybe he's just content where he... where he is.

52
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:44,760
要幫忙嗎
Can I help you?

53
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,670
什么
What?

54
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,010
要是他的話  他非常...他真的很有意思
If this is the one, he's so... he's really funny.

55
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,610
-他每周都會錄這種視頻  -這簡直...
- He does these weekly videos. - This is...

56
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,520
-看見沒  -太隨性了  太詭異了
- See? - It's so random. It's so weird.

57
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,530
-你肯定是喜歡上他了  -暫停
- Yeah, you have a crush on him. - Pause it.

58
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,420
我不懂  倒回去
I don't get it. Yeah, go back.

59
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,480
-你怎么會不懂呢  -我就是不懂
- Why don't you get it? - I just don't get it.

60
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,710
他膚白貌美又金發  太可愛了
It's like, he's blond, and he's cute.

61
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,810
不  他的眉毛實在是...
No, his eyebrows are just like...

62
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,210
瞎說  他的眉毛
Shut up. His eyebrows?

63
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,710
-你欣賞不來他的眉毛  -沒錯
- That's the one thing you couldn't get? - Yeah!

64
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,370
但我就是被眉毛撩到了
I get turned on by eyebrows, though.

65
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,910
好吧  太逗了
Okay, that's funny, yeah.

66
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,400
-你看他干了什么  -他怎么能那么做
- You see what he does, though? - How does he even do that?

67
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,970
我給你看視頻就是為了這個
That's the whole point why I'm showing you.

68
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,900
-太贊了  -太厲害了
- It's so genius. - So bad.

69
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,320
抱歉  先生  我想你上錯車了
Pardon me, sir. I think you have the wrong car.

70
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,760
{\an8}分裂

71
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,380
我們醒來就在這了
We woke up in here.

72
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,800
發生了什么
What the hell is going on?

73
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,220
我們為什么在這里  我爸出什么事了
What are we doing here? What happened to my dad?

74
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,610
他在外面
He's out there.

75
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,480
你知道我爸出什么事了嗎
Do you know what happened to my dad?

76
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,360
我第一個選你
I choose you first.

77
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,050
只要一會兒就好
It's only gonna be a minute.

78
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,460
尿自己身上  尿自己身上
Pee on yourself. Pee on yourself.

79
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,790
不  不
No! No!

80
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,750
不
No!

81
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,780
不要
Don't!

82
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,470
不
No!

83
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,520
把門打開
Open the door!

84
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,650
你沒事吧
Are you okay?

85
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,810
他要我給他跳舞
He wanted me to dance for him.

86
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,000
外面的門鎖上了
The outside door is locked.

87
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,200
一切都沒事
Everything is okay.

88
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,640
我們沒事
We're okay.

89
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,020
我們沒事
We're okay.

90
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,040
我聽見水花輕輕濺起的聲音
I hear the tiniest little splash.

91
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,900
它過來了
And here it comes.

92
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,760
自然界中罕有  就像這樣
A freak of nature, like this.

93
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,640
他穿過小河  他是如此的高
So, he comes across the stream, and he's so tall,

94
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,260
水連他的肚子都淹不到
that the water doesn't even get to his belly.

95
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,320
接著他停下了
Then he stops.

96
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,660
我的心臟都要跳出來了
And my heart's coming out of my chest.

97
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,340
你第一次獵鹿所以緊張了
You got buck fever.

98
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,010
約翰叔叔緊張了
Uncle John's got buck fever.

99
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,580
才不是的  凱茜  你爸是個騙子
That's not true, Casey. Your daddy's a liar.

100
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,030
-那鹿角有多大  -巨大無比
- How big was the rack? - It was huge.

101
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,170
射擊的時候你應該看著哪里  凱茜
Where are you supposed to look when you shoot, Casey?

102
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,070
看著軀干
At the body.

103
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,510
那他為什么卻看著鹿角
Then why was he looking at the rack?

104
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,100
因為他第一次獵鹿緊張了
'Cause he had buck fever.

105
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,680
你說什么她就跟著學什么
She'll say anything you say.

106
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,310
等三年后
You gonna do that

107
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,950
你拿到狩獵許可證  你第一次獵鹿也會緊張嗎
when you get your mentored hunting license in three years?

108
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,260
不會  先生
No, sir.

109
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,810
吃完以后記得把手套戴上
Be sure you put your gloves on after you finish.

110
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,790
在外面手腳是最先挨凍的
Your feet and your hands get cold first out there.

111
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,800
{\an8}突發新聞  綁架

112
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,720
三名學生被綁架
Three students abducted.

113
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,950
一名學生的父親在普魯士國王商場
The father of one of the students

114
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,930
暈頭轉向地醒來  報道稱他被下了藥
woke up dazed in King of Prussia, reportedly drugged.

115
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,150
他發現孩子和車都已失蹤
He found the kids and the car missing.

116
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,670
{\an8}有任何線索  請聯系當地警察

117
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,180
鄰居們均表示懷疑
Neighbors are in disbelief.

118
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,100
平素安靜的社區因綁架案而震驚
A normally quiet community is reeling after this abduction.

119
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,560
如果你知道這些女孩的下落
If you any information concerning the whereabouts of these girls

120
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,130
請立即聯系警方
you are urged to contact the police.

121
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,530
{\an8}巴里
我要見你  急事

122
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,480
你打開那扇門也沒有用  克萊爾
It doesn't matter if you open that door, Claire.

123
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,190
外面還有一扇鎖著的門
There's a second locked door.

124
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,640
他隨時會再進來的
He's gonna come in here again any second,

125
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,030
我們不能再讓他帶走我們中的一個
and we're not letting him take one of us out again.

126
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,480
我們只是掙扎尖叫
We just... we just cried and screamed,

127
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,460
我們沒有傷害他是因為我們怕激怒他
and we didn't hurt him because we were afraid to get him upset.

128
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,100
天哪  都是受害者無能的表現
God, that's victim shit! Jesus!

129
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,800
我們應該跟他打
We should fight him.

130
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,170
我們要對他拳打腳踢
We should drop a crazy-ass bomb on him.

131
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,740
我看見他扛著你們其中一個
I saw him carry one of you and lay you on the bed

132
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,070
毫不費力地放在床上
like you weighed nothing.

133
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,900
他一拳就能把我們打昏
One punch from him would knock one of us out.

134
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,020
我上過六個月的美式空手道課
I took... I took six months of Kenpo karate class.

135
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,640
你弄疼攻擊者來分散他的注意力
And you distract the assailant with pain.

136
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,630
在你們眼中一切都這么容易
Everything is so easy for you guys.

137
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,690
你做一個動作  還能預測到接下來會發生什么
You do one thing, you can predict the next thing.

138
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,930
這種情況下  這辦法行不通的
It's not the way it's gonna be in this situation.

139
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,540
我們逃不出去的
We're not getting out of here!

140
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,510
你的意思是  你不打算全力一搏嗎
You're saying that you're not gonna fight with everything in you?

141
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,980
唯一的機會...
You know, the only chance...

142
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,070
我們唯一的機會
The only chance we have

143
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,510
就是我們三個一起和他拼了
is if all three of us go crazy on this guy.

144
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,010
我們得趕緊行動
We have to hurry.

145
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,770
我們需要你  凱茜
We need you, Casey.

146
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,850
克萊爾很聰明的  我們就聽她的吧
Claire is smart, let's listen to her.

147
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,670
假如你愿意動手  那我也加入
I'll do it if you're gonna do it, too.

148
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,820
-我們能拼得過他  -他會傷害我們
- We can win. - He'll hurt us.

149
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:47,830
不  你們兩個都閉嘴
No. Shut up, both of you.

150
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,640
你振作一點
You're gonna pick your miserable self up

151
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,280
幫我們逃出這里
and help us get out of here.

152
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,600
你算了吧
Blow me.

153
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,110
你在普魯士國王商場
And your six months of karate

154
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,360
上的六個月的空手道課也算了吧
at the King of Prussia Mall can blow me, too.

155
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,790
不不  你今天不能這樣
No. No, no, you-you can't do this today.

156
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,320
你現在不能這樣
You can't do this right now.

157
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,220
你為什么要這樣  你為什么這副德行
Why do you do this! Why do you act like this?

158
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,240
為什么你一副與你無關的樣子
Why do act like you're not one of us?

159
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,470
凱茜  在瞄準的時候...
When you aiming, Casey...

160
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,700
要把兩只眼睛都睜開
Always keep both eyes open.

161
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,640
用槍管指著你的獵物
Cover your target with the barrel,

162
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:24,170
然后槍跟著獵物走  掌握它的節奏
then move with it to get its pace.

163
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,660
提醒你  頭幾次會很挫敗
I'm warning you its gonna be frustrating the first times.

164
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,900
你會射不到它或者射太過
You're gonna shoot under it or behind it.

165
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,960
你要學會如何緊跟目標
You'll learn to stay with it.

166
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,460
雌性比雄性要聰明
Females are smarter than the males,

167
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,290
這點你是清楚的  因為就和人類一樣
but you know that, it's like humans.

168
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,270
雌性的嗅覺是保命的關鍵
Females use their nose to stay alive.

169
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,950
確保它們有掩護
They make sure they have cover.

170
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,960
她們總是牢記  自己要努力活下來
They always remember, they're trying to stay alive.

171
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,640
公鹿會發出聲響暴露位置
Bucks go off by themselves.

172
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,380
在交配季節公鹿會變傻
Bucks get dumb during mating season.

173
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,470
男孩子們總是太吵了
Boys make too much noise.

174
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,320
沒錯
Yes, they do.

175
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,350
我比男孩子厲害  是不是
I'm better than a boy, right?

176
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,370
沒錯
Yes, you are.

177
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,500
等你們說的話有意義時  我會出聲的
I'll let you know when I hear something that makes sense.

178
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,110
我們甚至都不清楚  目前這是什么情況
We don't even know what this is yet.

179
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,170
我有了靈感
I... I was inspired.

180
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,530
不不不  那張
N-n-n-no, that one.

181
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,650
粉色帶刺雙排扣長禮服之前那個
That one, before the pink frock coat with the thorns.

182
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,080
那個本來應該弄成...
That's supposed to be like a...

183
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,240
弄成貼身夾克那種
like a tailored jacket,

184
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,490
但我要用手給它印上報紙大字標題
but I'm gonna hand-print it with newspaper headlines.

185
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,990
我是個穿衣簡單的人
Well, I'm a simple blouse-and-skirt person,

186
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,510
但這些...
but these...

187
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,370
這些真是太藝術了  巴里
these are very artistic, Barry.

188
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,780
這正是那種
Just the kind of thing

189
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,220
漢普敦[富人區]的女士們會花一萬五千美元
Hamptons ladies would spend 15,000 dollars on

190
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,150
就為了在慈善晚宴上穿一次的衣服
to wear once at a charity ball.

191
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,180
別說啦
Shut up.

192
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,690
你知道的  我不能待太久
You know, I-I can't stay too long.

193
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,700
我就是來拜訪一下
This is... this is just a... just a visit.

194
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,040
告訴我發生什么事了
Well, tell me what's going on?

195
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,920
什么  你指那封郵件嗎
What? You mean the email?

196
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:11,970
沒什么特別的
It's just the usual things.

197
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,800
就是感覺有點不堪重負了
Just feelings of being overwhelmed.

198
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,250
你的郵件寫得太簡潔了
Well, the terseness of your email

199
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,100
讓我感覺事情挺緊迫的
made it sound specific and time-related.

200
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,100
你是在找什么嗎
Are... are you looking for something?

201
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,900
-沒有  我只是在...  -沒有嗎
- No. No, I'm just... - No?

202
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,810
只是在欣賞而已
Just admiring.

203
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,920
-我現在好多了  -工作如何
- I'm better now. - How's work?

204
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,030
-棒極了  -我上次和他們談的時候
- It's great! - Well, when I last spoke to them,

205
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,970
他們說你是個模范員工
they believed you were a model employee.

206
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,470
他們覺得你又細致又認真
They found you meticulous and conscientious.

207
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,440
-你知道的吧  -我知道
- You know this, right? - I do.

208
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,220
你已經管理了那地方10年了
You've managed there for ten years.

209
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,920
你盡忠職守  巴里
You're functioning very well, Barry.

210
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,820
對你而言  那里是個難得的好單位
And it's a rare and wonderful place for you to work.

211
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,080
的確如此
Yes, it is.

212
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,420
其他有你這種心理障礙的病人中
You know, of all my other clients with your disorder,

213
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,060
你是工作最穩定的一個
you've been the most consistent at your job.

214
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,660
發生什么事了嗎  巴里
Did something happen, Barry?

215
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,250
你多大年紀了
How old are you?

216
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,580
網上對于這問題的答案不太一致
Just the internet is inconsistent on this point.

217
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,460
你為什么想到問這個
Why is that on your mind?

218
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,590
你退休或者去世之后  誰來照顧我們
Who's gonna look after us when you retire or pass on?

219
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,790
我們將不得不自己照顧自己
You know, we're gonna have to take care of ourselves

220
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,250
別人甚至都不相信我們的存在
and nobody even believes that we exist.

221
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,600
假如我出事了
If ever something were to happen to me,

222
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,760
我安排了
I've made arrangements

223
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,220
巴爾的摩的一名同事接手
with a colleague from Baltimore to take over.

224
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,400
你...你是一個人住嗎
You... you live alone?

225
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,730
你知道的
You know this.

226
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,840
抱歉  我是想問你獨居多久了
I'm sorry, I just meant how long?

227
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,350
一直如此
Always.

228
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,470
那一定很孤獨吧
That must be so lonely.

229
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:44,300
你猜怎么著  我...我感覺好多了
You know what, I'm.... I'm doing much better.

230
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,710
我不該給你發郵件的
I-I shouldn't have emailed you.

231
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,830
我只是...瞧瞧我  我太沖動了
I'm-I’m just.. Look at me, I'm too impulsive.

232
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,940
順便一問  有人聽你的嗎
By the way, is anybody listening?

233
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,490
有人在乎我們嗎
Does anybody care about us?

234
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,430
有的  實際上巴黎大學
Yes, the University of Paris

235
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,730
還邀請我去做講座呢
has asked me to do a lecture, in fact.

236
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,780
我會用網絡視頻  在這里做講座
I'm going to be doing it via Skype from right here.

237
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,310
人們越來越相信了
People are believing more.

238
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,170
我們下周老時間見
Let's meet at our usual time next week.

239
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,530
我希望你先別走  巴里
I would rather you didn't leave, Barry.

240
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,420
發生什么事了嗎
Did something happen?

241
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,020
別擔心  我只是來看看你
Don't worry, this was just a visit.

242
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,280
我現在感覺好多了
I'm doing much better. I actually...

243
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,070
你的素描不要了嗎  巴里
Don't you want your sketches, Barry?

244
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,820
平時你對它們可是寶貝得很
You're usually very protective of them.

245
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,810
對哦  謝謝

246
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,970
我們下周老時間見
I'll see you next week at our usual time.

247
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,340
謝謝你為我們抗爭  弗萊徹醫生
Thanks for fighting for us, Dr. Fletcher.

248

- Thanks, Dr. Fletcher. - Welcome.

249
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,940
我覺得我會搞砸的
I just think I'm gonna blow it.

250
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,420
不會的  會順利的

-我們下周見  -好的  謝謝

我不明白你是怎么和這些人打交道的
I don't know how you work with those people.

253
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,900
-和哪些人  -你的病人們
- What people? - Your patients.

254
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,450
你不能用拇指去轉輪子  傻子
You can't use your thumbs to spin the wheel, dumbasses!

255
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,640
他們總是用拇指
They always use their thumbs.

256
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,740
我們將這些
W-well, we look at people

257
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,560
曾受過重大打擊  與眾不同的人視作有缺陷
who've been shattered and different as less than.

258
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:38,320
如果他們反而比我們更健全呢
What if... they are more than us?

259
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,260
什么
What?

260
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,260
你相信他們嗎  你的病人
You believe them? Your patients?

261
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,500
就我們兩個人私下說說

我相信
Yes, I do.

263
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,030
輕輕地撥  輕輕地撥
Flick it! Flick it!

264
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,660
-無意冒犯  我反正不信  -沒關系

275
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,630
可別告訴我
Don't tell me.

00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,030
我有點害怕了
I'm getting frightened.

277
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,020
我還以為你能控制局面
I thought that you had this under control.

278
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,680
-請告訴我為時未晚  -食物準備好了
- Please tell me it's not too late. - The food is waiting.

279
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,950
她在那間房里嗎
Is she in that room?

280
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,290
-我們在這兒  -救救我們
- We are here! - Help us!

281
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,430
我們在這里面
We are in here!

282
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,980
丹尼斯  這什么情況  有多少個人
Dennis, what is this? How many are there?

283
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,520
別別  別進去  別進去
N-n-no... don't go in there! Don't go in there!

284
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,570
別擔心
Don't worry.

285
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,620
我會和他談談
I'll talk to him.

286
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,020
他聽我的話
He listens to me.

287
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,140
他不太舒服
He's not well.

288
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,960
他知道你們來這里的意義
He knows what you're here for.

289
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,870
我不準他碰你們
He's not allowed to touch you.

290
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,330
他知道的
He knows that.

291
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,520
{\an8}病患編號600-650

292
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,510
-卡倫  -喬
- Karen. - Joe.

293
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,260
他們說你不能在全國學術會上
They said you can't have your own panel

294
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,980
主持研討小組
at the national conference.

295
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,600
不過他們還是妥協了
They conceded, however,

296
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,940
你可以參加情感障礙研討會
that you can be part of the mood disorder panel.

297
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,240
這不是一種情感障礙
It's not a mood disorder.

298
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,090
我知道你的觀念  卡倫
I'm aware your beliefs, Karen.

299
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,870
這次有了新的證據  他們能接受嗎
Well, were they open this time with the new evidence?

300
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,340
你竟然用狗做為證據之一
One of your arguments is a dog?

301
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,640
你竟然提交了一個視頻  其中一條狗
You submitted video of a dog acting differently

302
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,440
在不同的時間對你的一名病人作出不同的反應
to one of your patients at different time?

303
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,650
比那還要更激動人心
It is more dramatic than that.

304
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,430
他們成為了自己認為的人
They are what they believe they are.

305
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,300
他們的大腦學會了自我保護
The brain has learned to defend itself.

306
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,720
你每次提起他們  都把他們說得神乎其神
You speak of them like they're supernaturally gifted.

307
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,960
好像他們擁有超能力之類的
Like... like they have powers or something.

308
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,500
卡倫  他們都是病人  遭受過創傷
Karen, these are patients. They have been through trauma.

309
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,840
或許現在他們能夠做到我們做不到的事情
And perhaps now they're capable of something we're not.

310
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,480
我們現在有腦部掃描技術
We have brain scans now.

311
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,040
分離性身份識別障礙[多重人格]患者
DID patients have changed

312
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:05,130
利用思想改變了自己的人體化學機能
their body chemistry with their thoughts.

313
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,480
他只是想嚇嚇我們而已
He's just trying to scare us.

314
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,070
他完全可以和自己交流
He was having a full conversation with himself.

315
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:17,390
"食物準備好了"那句話是什么意思
What was that line about "the food is waiting"?

316
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,060
你們知道的吧  這越來越累人了
Does everyone get how whacked this is

317
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,910
我們得馬上逃出去
and that we need to get out of here now?

318
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,300
你們...  不
You... no.

319
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,520
請保持衛生
Please keep your area neat.

320
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,470
這個衛生間慘不忍睹
The bathroom is unacceptable.

321
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,280
為了便于你們區分
To make it easy,

322
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,420
我用顏色標記了  藍瓶用來擦地板
I-I've color-coded this. Use the blue bottle for the floor.

323
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,440
粉瓶用來擦瓷磚
And the pink bottle for ceramic surfaces.

324
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,660
帕特里夏提醒了我
Patricia has reminded me that...

325
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,650
我被派去抓你們是有原因的
I was sent to get you for a reason.

326
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,760
你們是圣食
That you are sacred food.

327
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,930
我保證不會再打擾你們了
And I promise not to bother you again.

328
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,140
或許他養了條狗之類的
Maybe he has a dog or something.

329
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,930
他會把我們喂給狗吃
Think he's gonna feed us to his dogs?

330
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:53,770
{\an8}病患編號617
帕特里夏  11/23

331
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:56,680

黑德維希  9/23

333
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,250
凱茜
Casey.

334
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,300
凱茜
Casey!

335
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,020
我叫黑德維希  我有紅襪子
My name is Hedwig. I have red socks.

336
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,770
他在行動
He's on the move.

337
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,930
什么
What?

338
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,220
他  在
He's... on...

339
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:02,930
行  動
the... move.

340
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,420
-誰  -有人要來找你們了
- Who? - Someone's coming for you.

341
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,720
你們可不會樂意他來的
And you're not gonna like it.

342
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,240
你們在睡覺的時候有點吵
You guys make noises in your sleep.

343
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,710
-告訴我們  -我不應該說
- Tell us. - I'm not supposed to say.

344
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:22,070
但是  他對人們做了一些可怕的事情
But he's done awful things to people.

345
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,970
他也會同樣這么對你們
And he'll do awful things to you.

346
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,780
-我還有藍襪子  -我們是他的食物嗎
- I have blue socks, too. - We're his food?

347
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:35,040
-你幾歲了  -九歲
- How old are you? - Nine.

348
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,450
所以你不是劫持我們的那個家伙
So you're not the guy that took us?

349
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:47,240
-不是  -你也不是那位女士
- No. - You're not the lady?

350
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,810
你是瞎了嗎
What are you, blind?

351
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,870
你不知道他們是如何思考的
You don't know how they think?

352
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,960
不知道  他們...他們只告訴我一點點
No, they don't, they don't tell me much.

353
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,260
我剛吃了個熱狗
I just ate a hotdog.

354
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,460
你能幫幫我們嗎  黑德維希
Could you help us, Hedwig?

355
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,510
不能  我...我都不應該出現在這里
No. I'm.... I'm not even supposed to be here.

356
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,240
我把表現機會從丹尼斯先生那兒偷過來
I stole a light from Mr. Dennis,

357
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,860
但他馬上就要回來了
but he'll be back real soon, and...

358
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,280
我不能把表現機會搶過去太久
I can't steal a light for too long

359
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,650
否則他發現了就會生氣之類的
or he'll know and get angry, etc.

360
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,240
-再見啦  -等等
- See ya! - Wait!

361
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,500
我們聽到了些事情
We heard something.

362
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,510
我們之前不明白  
We didn't understand it,

363
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,210
但現在知道了
but... now we do.

364
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:36,990
你知道我們聽到什么了嗎
Do you know what we heard?

365
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,050
你們聽到什么了
What did you hear?

366
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:41,730
過來
Come here.

367
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,970
我悄悄告訴你
I'll whisper it to you.

368
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,640
那好吧
Okay.

369
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,210
這個人...
This guy...

370
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,840
是沖著你來的
is coming for you.

371
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,230
-你個大騙子  -我從不說謊  黑德維希
- You're a big fibber. - I never lie, Hedwig.

372
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,900
但是  丹尼斯先生...
But -- but Mr. Dennis..

373
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,170
他說他跟蹤了那兩個女孩四天
He said that he followed those two girls for four days

374
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:29,110
他知道  他要找的就是她們倆
and that he knew that they were the ones that he would want.

375
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,010
你不在的時候
When you're not around,

376
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,710
丹尼斯和那位女士說過了
Dennis and the lady talked about it.

377
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:38,930
他們說這次他很想找個男孩
They talk about how he wants a boy this time.

378
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,750
他們會把你給他
They're going to give him you.

379
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,900
不  帕特里夏女士  她說...
No, Ms. Patricia, she said...

380
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,790
她說  她不再生我的氣了
She said she's not mad at me anymore.

381
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,720
她有時候還會唱歌給我聽
She sings to me sometimes.

382
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,710
我覺得帕特里夏女士還是有點生你的氣
I think Ms. Patricia's still a little mad at you.

383
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,030
帕特里夏女士覺得我...覺得我很笨
Ms. Patricia thinks I'm... She thinks I'm stupid.

384
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,660
她覺得我會犯一些愚蠢的錯誤
She thinks I make silly mistakes.

385
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,490
看著我
Look at me,

386
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,310
我們就像是你的保姆
we're like your babysitters.

387
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,340
我會讓你看電視  給你做飯
I'll let you watch TV and make you a fun dinner.

388
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,770
我們都得離開這里
We all need to get out of here.

389
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,370
你可以帶我們出去
You could show us the way out.

390
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,160
有人回來之前  我們就已經出去了
We could be gone before anybody gets back, but...

391
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,530
但是我們得快點  黑德維希
we have to hurry, Hedwig.

392
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,120
我們得快點離開這里
We have to hurry and get out of here.

393
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,380
等...等一下
Wait, wait a minute.

394
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,270
在不讓在這工作的麻煩精發現的情況下
It took forever to get this place safe

395
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,270
把這個地方改造得很安全花了很長時間
without the nosey bodies that work here finding out.

396
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,160
你們不能出去
You can't get out of here!

397
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,420
-我得去擤鼻涕了  -不  拜托不要走
- I have to blow my nose. - No, no, wait, please don't go!

398
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,260
誰來了
Who's coming?

399
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,750
-這真的很嚇人  -沒人來
- This is seriously scary. - No one is coming.

400
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,190
他說了點什么
He said something.

401
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,320
他說了什么關于讓這個房間安全的事
He said something about making the room safe.

402
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,440
這都是全新的石膏板
This is all new drywall.

403
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,350
不安全的是什么
What was unsafe?

404
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,970
等一下  確定要這么做嗎
Wait, are we sure about this?

405
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,950
凱茜  你說得對
Casey, you're right.

406
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,510
這里的確有點什么
There's something in here.

407
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,780
他是在掩蓋出去的路
He was covering up a way out.

408
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,770
看到他就告訴我
Tell me if you see him.

409
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,620
凱茜  告訴我們你看到了什么
Casey, tell us what you see!

410
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,940
他來了
He's here.

411
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,720
不能讓他進來
You can't let him in!

412
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,800
別讓他進來  這是我們唯一的機會了
You can't let him in! This is our one chance.

413
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,480
-我們成功不了的  -能成功的
- We're not gonna make it. - Yes, we are!

414
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:49,110
什么  你們在做什么
What... Hey, what are you guys doing?

415
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:57,190
好了  
Okay, okay, quit it.

416
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,510
別鬧了
Okay, guys?

417
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,560
讓我進去  
Let me... can you let me in?

418
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,880
等一下  我們在換衣服
Give us a second, we are changing.

419
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,130
你們在干什么
What are you guys doing?

420
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:07,940
讓我進去
Let me in!

421
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,340
這一點也不好笑
Guys, you're not being funny.

422
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:25,680
你們現在的行為太賤了  我要抽你們耳光
You're being bithes. Now, I'm gonna slap you!

423
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,250
我要抽你們...
I'm gonna slap you in your face and your...

424
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,690
求你們幫我拖住他
Just give me as much time as you can.

425
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,530
你們會讓我惹上麻煩的
You're gonna get me into trouble.

426
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:36,970
伙計們
Guys!

427
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,450
瑪西亞
Marcia.

428
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,030
我還以為我弄丟你了
I thought I lost you.

429
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:37,200
請你出來  好嗎
Would you... would you step outside, please?

430
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,330
你喜歡嘲笑我們
You like to make fun of us,

431
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,740
但是我們比你想的要強大
but we're more powerful than you think.

432
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,610
出來
Step outside.

433
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:54,680
請
Please.

434
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,520
你不應該騙小孩
You shouldn't trick children.

435
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,340
那顯示出你是什么樣的人
That shows who you are.

436
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,210
看看你的毛衣  太破了  太臟了
Look at your sweater. It's- it's ruined, it's dirty.

437
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:21,770
脫下來
Remove it.

438
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,860
我在努力做個好人
I'm trying to be good.

439
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,370
你們不會再看到你們的朋友了
You'll not see your friend again.

440
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,360
她被單獨關起來了
She'll be kept separate.

441
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:23,260
現在把你們的裙子和上衣脫下來
Now, take off your skirt and take off your shirt.

442
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,940
你們的衣服都沾了灰塵弄臟了
Your clothes, you got all dirty from the dust.

443
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:53,170
一個分離性身份識別障礙患者的
One identity in an individual

444
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,290
其中一重人格
with dissociative identity disorder

445
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,500
可能有高膽固醇  就那一重人格
can have high cholesterol. One.

446
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,080
有過這樣的案例
There are been cases where one identity

447
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,030
有一重人格對蜂螫過敏
is allergic to bee stings.

448
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,160
其他的人格卻不
The others are not.

449
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,210
存不存在某些時刻
Are there moments where two identities

450
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,350
兩種人格共存
can co-exist at the same time?

451
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,040
的確有時候  兩種人格
There are times when two identities

452
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,540
可以同時獲得表現機會[光]can take the light or the spot,

453
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,040
或稱聚焦  或稱意識
or consciousness at the same time.

454
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,290
這在我研究的一名學生身上出現過
This happened with a student that I was working with.

455
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:24,260
她的左右手同時
And her left and right hands were taking notes

456
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,870
用不同的筆跡
in different hand-writings

457
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:28,960
對不同的事情記筆記
about separate things at the same time.

458
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:33,130
人格之間的差別可能是很大的
The differences in the identities can be dramatic.

459
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:36,650
就像你我之間
As much as the difference between you and me

460
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:40,060
會堂里每個人的差別一樣大
and every person in that auditorium.

461
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,960
不同的人格有不同的智商
The identities have different IQs.

462
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,910
有不同的體力
They have different physical strengths.

463
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:48,410
一種人格是個俄羅斯舉重運動員
One personality is a Russian weightlifter,

464
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,710
能舉起是他自身體重三倍的東西
and can lift three times his body weight.

465
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,880
他們高度集中的能力
Their ability to hyper-focus

466
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,570
和他們不同的經歷令人震驚
and have different experiences is astounding.

467
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:05,050
這些人是因為他們的苦難
Have these individuals through their suffering

468
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,400
激發了大腦的潛力嗎
unlocked the potential of the brain?

469
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,540
這是通往
Is this the ultimate doorway

470
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:18,280
所有我們稱之為未知的終極之門嗎
to all things we called unknown?

471
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:25,050
這是我們超自然意識的來源嗎
Is this where our sense of the supernatural comes from?

472
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,490
是關于色彩濃度
It's about depth and...

473
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,390
和曲線的  你看到那個了嗎
and curves. And, hey, you see that one?

474
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:48,160
有點像雪尼爾紗針織連衣裙
It's kinda like a chenille sweater-dress.

475
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,410
你是誰
Who are you?

476
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,820
巴里
Barry.

477
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,200
我覺得你不是巴里
I don't think you are.

478
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,540
我開發出了一種"嗅覺"
I've developed a nose for sensing

479
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:10,140
能夠判斷我在和誰說話  沒有和誰說話
whom I'm talking to and whom I'm not.

480
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,560
是我做了什么嗎
Have I done something?

481
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,350
你已經連續兩天發郵件進行臨時預約了
You've emailed for an unscheduled appointment two days in a row.

482
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:22,410
我們只是覺得不堪重負  我有一堆問題
We're just feeling overwhelmed, I... garden-variety of issues.

483
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:26,550
我認為是奧威爾  杰德  
I think Orwell, or Jade,

484
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,350
塞繆爾或海因里奇
or Samuel or Heinrich

485
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,910
短暫得到了表現機會并給我發了郵件
had the light for a moment and emailed me.

486
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,010
你卻來這兒告訴我一切都好
And you're here to tell me everything is okay.

487
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,460
是我給你發的郵件
I emailed you.

488
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,770
我能和他們之一談一談嗎
May I talk to one of them, please?

489
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,750
不能
That can't happen.

490
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,910
我告訴他們
I told them

491
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,700
今天我想單獨與你進行心理診療
that I wanna spend the session with you today.

492
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,800
我再問一遍
I'm gonna ask again.

493
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,460
現在和我交談的是誰
To whom am I speaking with now?

494
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,800
弗萊徹醫生  我是巴里
Dr. Fletcher, it's Barry.

495
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:08,660
并不像巴里  巴里是外向的領導者
It doesn't seem like Barry. Barry is an extroverted leader.

496
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,550
我就是啊
Of course, I am.

497
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,550
我從專業角度猜一下
I'm gonna take a professional guess

498
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,520
根據我從巴里口中得知的
based on the description of all 23 identities

499
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,790
在凱文體內的全部23種人格的描述
that live in Kevin's body that I've gotten from Barry.

500
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,030
我猜你是丹尼斯
I think I'm talking to Dennis.

501
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:36,520
不過由于某些原因  他被禁止出現
But he's been banned from the light because, among other reasons,

502
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:40,620
他喜歡看年輕姑娘裸體跳舞
He has a proclivity to watch young girls dance naked,

503
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,150
他自己也知道這樣不對
which he himself knows it's wrong

504
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,540
他自己也做過抗爭  但沒什么成效
and he's fought against it with little success.

505
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,570
我很高興我們終于能見面
I'm encouraged we can finally meet.

506
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,000
我之所以這么猜
And I've guessed this

507
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,950
是因為你進來之后
because you've adjusted the chocolate dish twice

508
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:56,090
動了兩次巧克力碟子  我知道你有強迫癥
since you came in here and I understand you have OCD.

509
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,460
我知道了  我知道了  聰明
Now I see, now I see. That's clever.

510
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,700
聰明  但我不是丹尼斯
That's clever. But I'm not Dennis.

511
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,170
你和帕特里夏
And you and Patricia

512
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:06,610
已經有很長一段時間被禁止出現了
have been banned from the light for quite a while now.

513
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:09,570
最主要的原因應該是你們的信仰
Primarily, shall we say, because of your beliefs.

514
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,010
帕特里夏和丹尼斯很不穩定  我不是丹尼斯
Patricia and Dennis are very unstable. I'm not Dennis.

515
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,020
你們倆現在都是主導嗎
Have you both take in charge now?

516
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,890
請相信我  我是巴里
Please believe me, I'm Barry.

517
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,990
請原諒我  我的職責就是質疑你
You must forgive me, my job is to challenge you.

518
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:33,630
你現在肯定也知道了  我已經知道了
And as you must know by now, I have plenty of opinions

519
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,110
你們每個人格是如何生活的
about how everyone should live their lives.

520
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,620
問我關于時尚的事  我可以證明的
Ask me something about fashion, I'll prove it.

521
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,760
或者...  你看你看  瑞士蓮巧克力
Or... or I'll... Look, look, look. Lindt.

522
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,910
你看看
Yeah, you look.

523
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,400
你看  我不是丹尼斯
You see, I'm not Dennis.

524
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,310
還要我做別的事嗎
You want me to do something else?

525
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,870
你有冰淇淋嗎  反正這衣服是混棉的
You got ice cream? This shirt is cotton blend anyway,

526
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,710
這領子是三個流行季以前的樣式
and the collar is from three seasons ago.

527
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,310
圍脖領  別逗了
Snood? I mean, come on.

528
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:24,050
杰  你從哪家"健康"的快餐店
Jai, what health-conscious fast food purveyor

529
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:26,520
買來這些雞翅
did you originally solicit to buy these chicken wings

530
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,780
還以一種輕微自殺姿態又熱了一遍
you've so lovingly reheated in a minor suicidal gesture?

531
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,340
貓頭鷹餐廳
Hooters.

532
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,970
總不能把它們扔了吧  弗萊徹醫生
And you can't just threw them out, Dr. Fletcher.

533
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:34,080
這簡直大錯特錯
This is wrong on so many levels.

534
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:37,370
3點15分的已經看完了  看看3點18分左右的
We finished about 3:15, so look around 3:18.

535
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,680
你肚子上長了肉  杰
You're getting a little soft on the middle, Jai.

536
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:45,270
快餐店創始人利用我們對脂肪無窮無盡的需求
The authors of Hooters play on our incessant need for fat

537
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,940
還利用了男人總想接近隆過胸的女人的需求
and man's incessant need to be in the proximity of augmented breasts.

538
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:52,790
這就像亨利五世開了家快餐店一樣
It's like Henry V ran a fast food franchise.

539
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:55,460
-那家店挺不錯的  弗萊徹醫生  -好吧
- It's a good place, Dr. Fletcher. - Right.

540
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,920
你怎么知道垃圾會灑一地
How'd you know the trash would be spilled?

541
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,300
怎么說呢  杰
How can I say this, Jai.

542
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,460
可能是因為你不夠細心吧
You're not the most meticulous of people.

543
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,780
這人不太不講究啊
This guys isn't very neat, is he?

544
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,480
就這樣穿過了垃圾堆
He walked right through the trash.

545
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:25,830
的確  任何一個正常人都會繞著走
No, Jai. Any normal person would've walked around it.

546
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:28,220
這是裝出來的
That was an act.

547
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,280
你想干什么  丹尼斯
What are your up to, Dennis?

548
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,390
還是說做主的是帕特里夏
Or is it Patricia who's deciding things?

549
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,260
我們不會死的
We're not gonna die.

550
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:43,130
雖然壞事常發生
Bad things happen.

551
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:46,150
但不會像這樣
But not like this.

552
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:48,530
凱茜
Casey.

553
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,070
跟我說說話
Talk to me.

554
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:57,630
我們得找到窗戶或者門什么的嗎
We need to get to a window or a door or something.

555
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:58,740
不是嗎
Don't you think?

556
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:17,000
刺激  凱茜  在于你能不能做到
The thrill, Casey, is about whether you can

557
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:20,170
比這動物更聰明
or can't outsmart this animal.

558
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:25,500
你之前都不喜歡來這里
See, you didn't used to like to come out here.

559
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:28,220
這像是我們的家庭傳統一樣  對吧
This is like our family tradition, right?

560
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,190
-這一槍真漂亮  兄弟  -謝謝  約翰
- Good shot, big brother. - Thank you, John.

561
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,100
我給你送飯來了  貪睡鬼
I have your meal, sleepyhead.

562
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:49,320
吃吧
Eat.

563
00:43:56,730 --> 00:44:00,670
好吃嗎  里面放了辣椒
It's good? It's got paprika in it.

564
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:05,860
抱歉
I'm sorry.

565
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:12,230
我要把一支很漂亮的花戴在你頭上
I think I'll put a pretty flower in your hair.

566
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:16,090
好了
Here we are.

567
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:25,590
這是為了表示你們很重要
That's to show how important you are.

568
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,280
跟我來  我們好好吃一頓飯
Come along. And we'll have a proper meal.

569
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:37,450
我明白你們對這一切很不滿意
I understand, these must all seem so unsatisfactory for you.

570
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:40,170
不過我們已經盡力了
But we are doing the best we can.

571
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,770
好吃嗎
Good?

572
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,680
克萊爾能來跟我們一起吃嗎
Can Claire come eat with us?

573
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,370
恐怕不行
No, no, I'm afraid that can't happen.

574
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,770
她差點毀了我們隆重的招待會
She almost ruined our big reception.

575
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,740
我聽說亞洲音樂有助于消化
I've heard that Asian people's music aids digestion.

576
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:31,570
我再給你們做一個三明治
I'll make you a second sandwich.

577
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:36,830
你們知不知道
Do you know...

578
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:42,760
獅子一家一天能吃15千克食物
a family of lions can eat 35 pounds a day?

579
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,510
一頭雄鹿會在繁殖期
A buck can loose 30% of its weight

580
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,320
因為追逐母鹿  體重降低30%
during mating season chasing does round.

581
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:53,440
它們是晨昏性動物
They're crepuscular, right?

582
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,820
意味著它們在黃昏或破曉間活動  你真聰明
Means they travel around during dusk and dawn. Good for you.

583
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:16,820
切歪了
It's crooked.

584
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,330
抱歉
I... Forgive me.

585
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:30,260
我不知道你們知不知道
I don't know if you know,

586
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:34,760
老虎只有三十顆牙齒
but tigers have only 30 teeth.

587
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,890
比狗還少十二顆
That's 12 less than a dog.

588
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,770
我覺得這很有趣
I thought that was a fun fact.

589
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:12,590
不
No.

590
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,160
回房間  關上門  快去
Go to your room, shut the door. Do it now.

591
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:57,950
"日光之下  終現熱忱"
"In the sun, we'll find our passion."

592
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:04,320
"日光之下  終尋本心"
"In the sun, we will find our purpose."

593
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:14,200
你一直被悉心保護著  從未真正受過苦
You've always been protected. You've never truly suffered.

594
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,230
這就是我們選擇你的原因  
And that's why we chose you.

595
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:19,530
你一直在熟睡
You've always been asleep.

596
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,050
你從未有過機會
You never had a chance.

597
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:32,030
你從未有過機會
You never had a chance.

598
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:36,430
那個黑發女孩會被關在另一個
The dark-haired girl, she's gonna be kept in another closet

599
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:38,900
我...  你可能也知道
I... you might as well know at this point.

600
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:40,460
野獸...
The beast...

601
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:44,640
就要來抓你們了  來抓你們三個人
He's coming for you. All three of you,

602
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,580
你們會被分開關著
you're gonna be kept separate.

603
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:52,360
你衣服上沾了一顆面包屑
You've got... you've got a crumb on your shirt.

604
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,030
請你脫下來
Please take it off.

605
00:48:56,090 --> 00:49:00,930
脫下來吧
Just.. just take it off.

606
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:54,840
你說了帕特里夏女士的壞話
It wasn't nice what you said about Ms. Patricia.

607
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:56,710
你撒謊
You lied.

608
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:03,610
我很抱歉  黑德維希
I'm sorry about that, Hedwig.

609
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:08,830
你們騙我  讓我害怕之類的
You guys lied to me, made me scare, etc.

610
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:15,190
丹尼斯先生說你穿了很多衣服
Mr. Dennis, he says you wear a lot of shirts.

611
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:16,830
我喜歡這件
I like this shirt.

612
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:18,760
謝謝
Thank you.

613
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:21,740
你知道丹尼斯和帕特里夏女士是什么人嗎
Do you know who Dennis and Ms. Patricia are?

614
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:22,890
不知道
No.

615
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:29,080
你看  我們所有人都要坐在椅子上等待
See, everyone of us has to wait in a chair.

616
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,820
而巴里來決定誰能表現出來
And Barry, he decides who stand in the light.

617
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:36,990
但是他因為我喪失了這種權力
But Barry lost that power because of me.

618
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:41,420
我想什么時候表現  就什么時候表現
I can wish myself in the light anytime I want.

619
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:45,240
這是我的特殊能力
It's a... it's a special power.

620
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:50,000
只要我想  巴里就不得不在椅子上坐著
Barry just has to keep sitting in his chair, if I want him to.

621
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:52,740
所以丹尼斯和帕特里夏女士
That's why Dennis and Ms. Patricia

622
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,500
說我可以跟他們一起待著
said I could be with them.

623
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,110
丹尼斯和帕特里夏女士
Dennis and Ms. Patricia,

624
00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:01,300
他們相信野獸的存在  也相信它的能力
they believe in the beast and what he can do.

625
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:05,440
你見過他嗎
Have you seen him?

626
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:09,630
野獸
The.. beast?

627
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,150
沒有  我能吻你嗎
No. Can I kiss you?

628
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,160
我想去吻那個黑頭發的女孩子
I wanted to kiss the other girl with the dark hair,

629
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,000
但是她現在有麻煩了
but she's in trouble.

630
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:22,960
你想嗎
So you want to?

631
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,190
雖然我也不是很擅長親吻
I mean, I don't know much about kissing, though.

632
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:26,110
好的
Yeah.

633
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:30,930
太好了
Okay.

634
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,080
好的  開始了
Okay, here we go.

635
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:40,040
我好緊張
I'm so nervous.

636
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,810
一  二  三
One, two, three.

637
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:59,100
你現在可能已經懷孕了
You might be pregnant now.

638
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:05,230
-我的吻技好嗎  -挺好的
- Am I a good kisser? - Yeah.

639
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:08,050
我喜歡跳舞  你喜歡跳舞嗎
I love dancing. You like dancing?

640
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:12,770
我喜歡在房間里聽著CD機的音樂跳舞
I like dancing to my CD player in my room.

641
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:14,910
我最喜歡聽坎耶·維斯特的歌
Kanye West is my main man.

642
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:18,500
我們在我的房間里放了CD機
We got my CD player set up in my room,

643
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,810
就放在窗戶旁邊
right next to my window.

644
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:22,540
我就像這樣
I'm like...

645
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:31,250
"晃動身軀"
"We got the moves!"

646
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:36,760
或許我可以看著你跳舞
Maybe I could watch you dance

647
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,290
跟你一起聽音樂
and listen to music with you.

648
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:45,610
-不行  音樂都在我的房間里  -那好吧
- No, my music is in my room. - Oh, right.

649
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:51,600
你可以偷偷帶我過去
Maybe you could sneak me there.

650
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,090
你是在耍我之類的嗎
Are you trying to trick me, etc?

651
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,550
我會告發你的
I'll tell on you.

652
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,840
-我會告發你的  -我告訴你一些事情
- I'm telling on you! - I'll tell you something.

653
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,810
你可以判斷我是不是在說謊  好嗎
And you can tell me if I'm lying or not, okay?

654
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:07,970
就像是測試一樣
Like a test, okay?

655
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:18,220
我故意在學校惹麻煩
I get into trouble at school on purpose.

656
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:25,380
這樣就可以被留校反省
So I can get sent to detention.

657
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,500
這樣我就能遠離所有人
To get away from everyone.

658
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:41,540
我就能一個人呆著
So that I can be alone.

659
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,940
好吧  我帶你去看我房間里的東西
Okay, I'll show you something cool in my room.

660
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,160
好的
Okay.

661
00:53:58,840 --> 00:53:59,900
但是要等丹尼斯先生
But after Mr. Dennis

662
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,320
完成典禮的準備工作之后
has finished to getting-ready ritual.

663
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,450
我要走了  他還有個預約
I have to go. He's got an appointment.

664
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,750
我睡著的時候
When I fall sleeping,

665
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:07,730
他們中總有人想要
one of the others keep trying

666
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:09,860
去向女醫生告發我們
to reach the doctor lady to tell on us.

667
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:12,140
{\an8}卡倫·弗萊徹  心理學碩士

668
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,910
那條褲子  里襯是紅色的
That pant, it's got a red lining.

669
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:15,500
從褲子側邊的開口就能看出來
You can see it in the long slit down the side.

670
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:20,480
我們已經談了二十分鐘的絲綢和羊毛混紡了
We've been talking about silk and wool blend for 20 minutes.

671
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,860
我猜  你大半夜給我發郵件
Well, can I guess that you emailed me in the middle of the night,

672
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:25,920
要求緊急診療
for an emergency session,

673
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:30,080
應該是有形形色色的問題
due to garden-variety issues?

674
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:34,460
我不開心  就給你發郵件咯
I was down, and I emailed you.

675
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:36,670
但是等我醒來的時候  我就好多了
And I woke up and I feel better.

676
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:38,880
我感覺好多了
I.. I feel better.

677
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,130
我有個想法
I had a thought.

678
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,850
我想談談工作中發生的事
I want to talk about the incident at work.

679
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:49,390
沒事的  巴里  你很安全
It's okay, Barry. You're safe.

680
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:52,240
我只是想幫你回憶起一些細節
I just want to bring the details back.

681
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,630
我們只來說說一些細節就好了
We're just talk about the details.

682
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,770
新澤西州卡姆登市的一所高中
A high school from Camden, New Jersey

683
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:01,450
在你工作的地方舉辦了一次實習考察
was on a field trip at your place of work.

684
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:04,630
兩個年輕的女生向你走過來
And two young ladies came up to you.

685
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:09,610
其中一個抓住你的手  放進襯衫里她的胸上
And one took your hand and put it under her shirt on her breast.

686
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:10,870
另一個也這么做
And the second did the same.

687
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:14,110
之后她們就跑開了  向她們的朋友們大笑
And then they just run off, laughing to their friends.

688
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:16,890
你以為她們在玩大冒險的游戲
You surmised that it might be on a dare.

689
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:19,460
你說過她們大概十七八歲左右
You said they were 17 or 18.

690
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:21,470
你說因為這件事  你這幾天都很失落
You said it upset you for days.

691
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:24,800
只是個青少年惡作劇罷了  我現在明白了
It was just a teenage prank. I get that now.

692
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,300
你看  這是我的錯
And see, that's my mistake.

693
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:33,300
我覺得這件事我處理得太含糊了
I believe that I went over this incident with you too fast.

694
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:36,180
雖然你說過你沒事
Although you said, you were fine.

695
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:40,450
而且我見到的其他人格也都說沒事
And the other identities I met with said, it was fine.

696
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:42,960
但是我相信...
I believe that this...

697
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:47,560
這件事讓你想起了童年時受虐的回憶
brought up issues from when you were a child and abused.

698
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:50,190
有時候  另一個虐待事件
Sometimes another incident of abuse

699
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:53,770
會使被壓抑的人格表現出來
can cause suppressed personalities to take the light.

700
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:56,710
丹尼斯  如果是你的話
Dennis, if this is you..

701
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,300
我完全理解
I completely understand..

702
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:03,630
你為什么想掌控身體  保護其他人格
why you felt the need to take over and protect the others.

703
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:06,440
得了  醫生  你又來了
Please. Doctor, not this again.

704
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,360
其他人告訴我  你和帕特里夏
The others told me that you and Patricia

705
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:11,990
把野獸的事情告訴了大家
told the group about this beast.

706
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:13,390
而我告訴他們
And I told them that

707
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:15,400
這些只是丹尼斯和帕特里夏
these are just scary stories

708
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:19,810
講給他們聽的恐怖故事  是為了嚇唬他們
that Dennis and Patricia tell the others, to scare them.

709
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:22,430
這野獸是如何在墻上爬行
How this beast can crawl on walls,

710
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:24,550
就像最頂尖的攀巖者
like the best rock climbers

711
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:27,000
利用最微弱的摩擦力和不平整的地方
using this slightest friction and imperfections,

712
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,860
使身體緊貼幾乎垂直的墻面
to hold his body close to seemingly sheer surfaces.

713
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:37,090
他的皮膚是多么堅硬厚實  就像犀牛的皮
How his skin is thick and tough like the hide of a rhinoceros.

714
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:43,680
你真的相信這些關于野獸的事嗎
Do you really believe the stories about the beast?

715
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:48,170
如果你是丹尼斯的話
If this is you, Dennis,

716
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:52,320
我明白為什么凱文需要你了
I understand why Kevin needs you.

717
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:58,110
你很強壯  又很自律  一絲不茍
You are strong and disciplined. You are precise.

718
00:56:58,110 --> 00:57:01,120
而且你不會讓別人利用你
And you will not be taken advantage of.

719
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:04,670
你可以相信我
You can trust me.

720
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:10,870
比如說  我完全可以利用凱文的全名
For example, I do have the ability to use Kevin's full name

721
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:14,070
把他叫出來  就像之前那樣
and bring him forward, as he has in the past.

722
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,520
但是我不會這么做
But I wouldn't do that.

723
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:21,180
我知道那會讓你們全亂套的
I know that, that would be chaos for all of you.

724
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:23,180
大家都會想出現
Everyone would grab the light.

725
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:26,060
我不想那樣傷害你們
I don't want to hurt any of you that way.

726
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:29,270
你不需要躲藏
You don't have to hide.

727
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:33,980
我知道你是在意凱文的
I know you are someone who cares for Kevin.

728
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:39,720
我并不覺得你邪惡
You are not evil to me.

729
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:44,770
你是不可或缺的一部分
You were necessary.

730
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:51,160
丹尼斯  是你嗎
Dennis, is that you?

731
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:07,860
他們一直把我們大家稱為"群"
They keep calling us "the horde".

732
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:11,750
就是其他的人格
The others, you know.

733
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:17,260
帕特里夏女士和我  我們被人嘲笑
Ms. Patricia and I, we're ridiculed.

734
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,400
我們的確不完美
Now, we're not perfect.

735
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:23,320
但也不該被嘲笑
But we don't deserve to be ridiculed.

736
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:27,570
我們都在抗爭  他們必須承認這一點
We're all struggling. They have to admit that.

737
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:35,820
我很高興見到你  丹尼斯
I am pleased to meet you, Dennis.

738
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:38,810
我也是
You, too.

739
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:45,970
你好像不知道是誰給我發了緊急診療的郵件
I assume you don't know who emailed me for the emergency session.

740
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:48,020
肯定是其他某個人格
One of the others.

741
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,690
-現在是你主導嗎  -對  是我們了
- Are you in charge? - Yeah, we've taken charge.

742
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:55,230
只有我們能保護凱文
We're the only ones who can protect Kevin.

743
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:57,650
我們都是為了保護凱文
We're all here to protect Kevin.

744
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,100
他太軟弱
He's very weak.

745
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:05,060
他不知道我們能有多強大
He doesn't know how powerful we can be.

746
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:09,050
你能告訴我  你什么時候第一次出現
Would you mind telling me when you first came into existence?

747
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,010
還有你和帕特里夏
And how you and Patricia,

748
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:17,840
那另一個不受歡迎的人格  是如何結盟的
the other undesirable identity, became aligned?

749
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:25,240
不說也沒關系  你還有堅定的信念嗎
That's okay. Do you still have strong beliefs?

750
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:30,640
-要看情況  -這個關于野獸的故事
- That depends on what. - This story of the beast.

751
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:40,460
丹尼斯  有件事也許能讓你不那么迷茫
One thing, Dennis, that may comfort you if you are confused,

752
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:44,140
你見過其他的人格
is that you've met the other alters.

753
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,440
你們都坐在房間里的椅子上  對嗎
You're all in a room in chairs, right?

754
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:48,950
沒錯
Yeah.

755
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:51,410
但你從沒見過野獸
But you never met the beast?

756
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:54,050
因為他不和你們住在一起嗎
Because he doesn't reside with the rest of you?

757
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:55,900
因為他住在鐵路場院里
Because he resides in the train yard,

758
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,180
就像故事里說的那樣
as the story goes.

759
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,660
因為凱文的父親是坐火車離開的
Because Kevin's dad left on the train.

760
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:01,600
但事實是  
But the fact is,

761
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:05,200
你和帕特里夏從沒見過野獸
you and Patricia have never met the beast.

762
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:08,740
-對吧  -沒有
- Have you? - No.

763
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:12,120
那是因為他不是一個人格  
That's because he's not an alter.

764
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:15,690
不是第24個
He's not the 24th identity.

765
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,940
他只是你們的幻想
He is a fantasy.

766
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:40,310
快點  跟我走
Hurry up! Let's go!

767
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,730
過來  是時候了
Come on, it's time!

768
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:11,680
我知道
I know.

769
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:16,560
-那是你的CD機  -沒錯
- This is your CD player? - Yeah.

770
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:23,350
你不喜歡嗎  它有年頭了
You don't like it? It's not new.

771
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:26,760
不  不  我只是...
No, no, I'm just a..

772
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:32,380
我不明白  你說它放在窗戶旁邊
I'm confused. You said it was near a window.

773
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:33,880
在這里
Oh, that's here!

774
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:37,020
看
Watch.

775
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:38,810
現在是關上的
Now, it's closed.

776
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:41,300
打開了
Now, it's open.

777
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:44,270
關上了
Now, it's closed.

778
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,690
打開了
Now, it's open.

779
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:57,790
你以為是一扇真的窗戶嗎
Did you think it was a real window?

780
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:04,530
然后你就能逃走之類的
So you could leave, etc?

781
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,360
幫我逃出去  黑德維希
Help me get out of here, Hedwig.

782
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:15,070
只要把鑰匙給我就好  讓我出門
Just give me the keys and let me out the door.

783
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:16,890
求你了
Please.

784
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:18,010
帕特里夏女士說
Ms. Patricia says that

785
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:21,480
等野獸來了  就沒人會再嘲笑我了
nobody will make fun of me anymore when the beast comes.

786
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,730
她說所有人都會看到我有多棒
She said that everyone must see how amazing I am.

787
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:27,180
沒有人會在意我那些愚蠢的錯誤了
And then all of my silly mistakes, they won't matter anymore.

788
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:28,810
我覺得你應該回你的房間
I think you should go back to your room.

789
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:30,420
不  等等  求你了
No, wait! Please!

790
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:32,290
我想聽你的坎耶·韋斯特的專輯
I wanna hear your Kanye West albums!

791
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,160
帶我去你的房間
Show me your room!

792
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,830
就待在這里吧  抱歉我剛才要離開
Let's stay here, I'm sorry I asked to leave.

793
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:37,030
我不能
I can't.

794
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,770
你說你要給我看一些酷酷的東西  對嗎
You said you wanna show me something cool, right?

795
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:41,410
-給我看  -我不想
- Show me something! - I don't want to!

796
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:42,440
求你
Please!

797
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:46,790
這個
This!

798
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:00,260
-這很棒  -這不是個玩具
- It's nice. - It's not a toy.

799
01:04:06,110 --> 01:04:08,690
-這是真的嗎  -是的
- This this real? - Yes.

800
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:12,500
是丹尼斯先生的
It's Mr. Dennis'.

801
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:16,160
他根本不知道我偷了這個
He doesn't even know I stole it.

802
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:19,290
很酷吧
Pretty cool, right?

803
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:22,870
你可以聽到別人說話
You can listen people talking

804
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,990
而他們根本不知道你在偷聽
and they don't even know you're listening.

805
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,260
-用這個可以和誰通話  -別碰那里
- Who does this talk to? - Don't touch that.

806
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:33,470
我只想看看它能不能用
I just want to see if it works.

807
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:36,990
你在干什么
What are you doing?

808
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:38,480
別按那個按鈕  我們會被發現的
Don't touch the buttons. You're gonna get us found out.

809
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,280
這里是東門  什么事
Yeah, east gate here. What up?

810
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:46,890
別說話
Do not talk.

811
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:48,940
怎么了
Whaddup?

812
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:53,740
-你好  -不要
- Hello? - Don't!

813
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:54,850
我會打你的
I'm gonna slap you!

814
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:56,000
你是誰
Who is this?

815
01:04:58,550 --> 01:05:01,010
有人在嗎  我叫凱茜·庫克
Hello? Hello, my name is Casey Cooke!

816
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:01,960
我被關在了一間地下室里
I'm being held in a basement!

817
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:04,140
我和其他兩個女孩被綁架了
I've been abducted with two other girls!

818
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:07,900
什么玩意
Who the hell is this?

819
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:17,210
有人嗎
Hello?

820
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:22,750
凱茜·庫克  我被綁架了  你得找到我
Casey Cooke! I've been abducted! You need to find me!

821
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:26,110
貝蒂  是你嗎  這不好玩
Betty, is that you? This isn't fun.

822
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:28,510
快報警  我肯定離你不遠
Call the police! I must be near you.

823
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:31,390
我被關在一間像地下室的房間里
I'm being held in a basement or something.

824
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:34,770
行了  貝蒂  幫我向拉里和魚兒們問好
Okay, Betty, listen. Tell Larry and fish I said hi.

825
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:37,350
告訴他  他的耳機還在我這兒呢
Tell him I still got his orange earphones and...

826
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:41,230
我不知道我在哪  這里有個男人
I don't know where I am. There is a man here.

827
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:44,180
他綁架了我們  他要殺我
He abducted us and he's going to kill me.

828
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:56,090
我只剩下幾個小時了
I only have a few hours left.

829
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:01,370
求你
Please.

830
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:08,070
求你了  來人救救我們
I'm begging you. Somebody save us.

831
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:12,480
等等  你是誰  怎么得到我們的對講機的
Wait, who is this? And how did you get one of our walkies?

832
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:23,250
雙手合十  擺成懺悔禮
Put your hands together in contrition.

833
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:29,590
"日光之下  終現熱忱"
"In the sun, we will find our passion."

834
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:38,670
"日光之下  終尋本心"
"In the sun, we will find our purpose."

835
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:52,280
我在超市的慰問卡上看過這些話
I read that on a sympathy card in the supermarket.

836
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:56,030
是葬禮用的  但我覺得它很好看
It was for funerals, but I saw it was beautiful.

837
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:05,240
丹尼斯會向你說明今晚的意義
Dennis will explain the meaning of this evening.

838
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:43,010
野獸是嗅覺靈敏的生物
The beast is a scenting creature,

839
01:07:43,170 --> 01:07:47,010
代表著人類進化的最高形態
who represents the highest form of human's evolution.

840
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:50,920
他認為普通人類的時代結束了
He believes the time of ordinary humanity is over.

841
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:54,940
希望這能讓你感到平靜
I hope this makes you feel calm.

842
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:01,760
你將見到更偉大的存在
You will be in the presents of something greater.

843
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:06,320
我本來要讓你脫下最后一件上衣  但不會了
I was gonna ask for your last shirt, but I won't.

844
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,050
因為今晚是神圣的
Because tonight is a sacred night.

845
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:12,280
快結束了
It's almost over.

846
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:22,680
凱茜  快點
Casey, come on!

847
01:08:23,470 --> 01:08:25,330
我們再來玩動物扮演游戲吧
Let's pretend we're animals again!

848
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:26,860
快點
Come on!

849
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:31,790
凱茜  快  這是我們的游戲
Casey, come on! This is our game!

850
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,930
否則我就告訴你爸  說你不乖
Or I'll tell your dad you're not being nice.

851
01:08:56,950 --> 01:08:58,460
快  把衣服脫光
Come on! Take off your stuff.

852
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:01,000
動物是不穿衣服的
Animals don't wear clothes.

853
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:02,770
快點
Come on!

854
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:05,510
快
Come on!

855
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:32,310
凱茜寶貝
Casey-bear.

856
01:09:35,530 --> 01:09:36,760
這不好玩
This isn't funny.

857
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:42,570
上膛了嗎
Is it loaded?

858
01:09:45,870 --> 01:09:46,830
凱茜
Casey?

859
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:50,450
我是你叔叔
I'm your uncle.

860
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:55,030
停下  凱茜
Stop it, Casey!

861
01:09:56,370 --> 01:09:57,860
把槍放下
Put that gun down!

862
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,050
我要生氣了
I'm getting upset!

863
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,280
我要發火了
I'm about to get very angry!

864
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:03,450
把槍給我
Give me the gun!

865
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:12,010
你差點殺了我
You could've killed me.

866
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:47,120
{\an8}收件箱  20封未讀
巴里  我們需要你

867
01:11:20,290 --> 01:11:22,220
-這地方關門了  -沒事的
- This place is closed. - No, it's okay.

868
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:23,850
-你進不去的  -沒事
- You can't get in. - No, it's okay.

869
01:11:30,550 --> 01:11:31,740
你好  丹尼斯
Hello, Dennis.

870
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:36,540
你們中的一位剛給我發了郵件
One of the others emailed me just now.

871
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:39,490
-沒事吧  -我們沒事
- Is everything okay? - We're fine.

872
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:43,910
丹尼斯  有你是凱文的福氣
Dennis, Kevin is really lucky to have you.

873
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:48,810
你們很特別  我只是不想你們受傷
You are quite extraordinary. I just don't want you guys get hurt.

874
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:57,070
你認為我們很特別嗎
You think we're extraordinary?

875
01:11:58,490 --> 01:12:02,870
我喜歡你  丹尼斯  我能進去嗎
I like you, Dennis. May I come in?

876
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:04,570
我們可以談談嗎
And can we talk?

877
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:08,680
我知道你想告訴我一些事
I know you want to tell me something.

878
01:12:10,450 --> 01:12:12,500
為什么不告訴我呢
Why don't you just tell me?

879
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:30,100
我們倆很像
We're very similar, you and I.

880
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:32,310
都是局外旁觀者
Both on the outside looking in.

881
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:34,260
請坐
Please, sit.

882
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:39,200
很少有人來我家做客  我去給你倒點水
I don't get many visitors. I'll get you some water.

883
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:43,160
他們在南邊那棟樓里給我留了個好地方
They got a proper quarters for me in a building on the south side

884
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:45,190
但我們都已經搬到這兒了
but we're already here.

885
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:47,180
他們升我為維修部的主管時
When they promoted me to head of maintenance,

886
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:48,450
說這里就歸我了
they said I could have it.

887
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:51,660
你要去見誰
Who are you going to meet?

888
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,800
我想談談
I want to talk about...

889
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:03,250
凱文
Kevin and...

890
01:13:04,210 --> 01:13:06,410
還有他母親對他做的事
what his mother did to him.

891
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,450
我全記得
I remember it all.

892
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:13,220
我很高興你突然這么坦白
I'm happy you're suddenly so open.

893
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:15,630
凱文的媽媽有很多種惡毒的方法
Kevin's mother had rather malevolent ways

894
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:17,870
來懲罰這個三歲的孩子
of punishing this 3-year-old.

895
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:20,590
你就是在那時候出現的嗎
Is that when you arrived in the light?

896
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:21,560
是的
Yeah.

897
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:25,350
避開她注意的一種方式
The one way to avoid her attention

898
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:29,620
就是讓一切保持完美無瑕
was to keep everything spotless, everything perfect.

899
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:34,200
我知道你的出現是好心  丹尼斯
I know you're coming from good intentions, Dennis,

900
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,640
但現在還有其它方式幫助凱文
but there are other ways to help Kevin now.

901
01:13:37,310 --> 01:13:41,140
我的很多病人進了精神病院
I've lost so many patients into the system.

902
01:13:42,370 --> 01:13:43,310
我想讓你知道  丹尼斯
I want you to know, Dennis.

903
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:45,730
我不會放棄為你們爭取的
I will never stop fighting for you.

904
01:13:46,450 --> 01:13:49,880
我的病人已經成了我的家人
My patients have become my family.

905
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:53,680
我選擇了他們  而不是更傳統的方式
They are what I've chosen instead of a more traditional path.

906
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:57,060
我希望你能對我坦白
I hope you feel you can be truly honest with me.

907
01:13:57,060 --> 01:13:59,760
其實我想對你坦白
I actually wanna be honest with you.

908
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,190
我之前撒謊了
I lied before.

909
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,820
你問我有沒有見過野獸的時候
When you asked, if I'd ever met the beast,

910
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:11,430
我說"沒見過"  那不是真的
I said "no". That really isn't true.

911
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:16,870
你寫過一個德國女人的事
You wrote about a woman in Germany,

912
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:19,360
她瞎了十年
who'd been blind for 10 years.

913
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:23,680
之后被診斷出患了分離性身份識別障礙
And then it was discovered that she had DID.

914
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:27,620
后來她的三個人格產生了視覺
Then three of her identities developed sight.

915
01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:32,340
你推斷  她的視神經再生
You speculated that her optical nerves regenerated

916
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:34,740
是因為她的信念
because of her beliefs.

917
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:36,960
你想說什么
What are you trying to say?

918
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:39,100
弗萊徹醫生  有些事情
There are things, Dr. Fletcher,

919
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,590
我們都覺得很難相信
that all of us would find hard to believe.

920
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:45,130
你是想說  還存在第24個人格嗎
Are you trying to tell me there is a 24th identity?

921
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:46,930
你保護有問題的人
You protect the broken.

922
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:51,280
你說你認為這個情況很特別時
When you said you saw this situation was extraordinary,

923
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:55,300
-我就知道  也許你能理解  -理解什么
- I knew you can maybe understand. - Understand what?

924
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:56,850
野獸
The beast..

925
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:59,870
是真的
is real.

926
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:05,530
他剛出現  你說中了一切
He's just emerged. You were right about everything.

927
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:07,520
他長什么樣
What does he look like?

928
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:11,590
他的塊頭比我大得多
He is much bigger than I am.

929
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,320
而我是我們中塊頭最大的
And I'm the biggest of all of us.

930
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:18,890
他很高  很強壯
He's tall, he's very muscular.

931
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:21,780
他長著長長的鬃毛
He's got a long mane of hair

932
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:26,380
他的手指是我們的兩倍長
and his fingers are... are twice the length of ours.

933
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:29,830
他相信我們很特別
He believes we're extraordinary.

934
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:35,370
相信我們并非錯誤的存在  相信我們的潛能
That we don't represent a mistake, but our potential.

935
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:40,430
你也是這么說的
You say the same things.

936
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:45,070
他在行動
He's on the move.

937
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:46,700
這是什么意思
What does that mean?

938
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,600
我不明白  他不可能是真的
I don't understand. He can't be real.

939
01:15:54,110 --> 01:15:58,120
人類的潛能肯定有其極限
There must be limits to what a human being can become.

940
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:02,710
這個故事還有另一面  對嗎
And there's another whole part of the story, isn't there?

941
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,800
以不潔年輕人為食
About the eating of the impure young?

942
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,980
"不潔"到底是什么意思
What does "impure" even mean?

943
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,700
我們應該討論這個  你才能完全理解
We should discuss that, so that you can understand fully.

944
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:18,080
-理解什么  -有時候
- Understand what? - Sometimes...

945
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,200
沒有別的辦法
there's just no other way.

946
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:26,730
你要去見誰
Who are you going to meet?

947
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:30,090
他
Him.

948
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:39,470
你知道嗎  我想把這些都記下來
You know what, I would love to take notes on all of this.

949
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:44,240
我們應該在明天診療時談談這事
We should probably discuss this in a proper session tomorrow.

950
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:47,340
真的嗎  你能接受這事
Really? You're okay with this?

951
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:50,900
這真是太好了  你非常坦誠
This has been so wonderful, you're being so open.

952
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:53,110
我可以感受到
I can see that you feel very empowered

953
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,810
野獸的理念讓你覺得更強大了
by the philosophies of the beast.

954
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:56,840
-我... -我現在得走了
- I... - I'm going to go now.

955
01:16:57,090 --> 01:16:59,700
我就知道你會理解的  再見
I knew you'd understand. I'll see ya.

956
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:14,960
你介意
Would you mind...

957
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:19,240
我借用一下你的洗手間嗎
if I used your bathroom?

958
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:22,500
不介意
No.

959
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:27,410
就在大廳下面  下樓左手邊
It's down the hall, near the stairs on your left.

960
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:36,190
-怎么樣了  -好的
- How we doing? - Okay.

961
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:16,990
你是真的嗎
Are you real?

962
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:23,940
你是誰  救救我
Who is it? Help me.

963
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,230
-救救我  -是有人來了嗎
- Help me. - Is someone there?

964
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:32,440
-我的天吶  -求你了  救救我
- Oh, my God. - Please, help me!

965
01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:37,430
他們永遠達不到自己的潛力
They will never reach their potential.

966
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:38,700
他們都不重要
They don't really matter.

967
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:40,690
聽我說  丹尼斯
Listen to me, Dennis.

968
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:43,780
我該更仔細地聆聽你的
I should've listened better.

969
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:47,070
我該知道你能做出什么事來
I should've understood what you're capable of,

970
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:48,820
你有多強大
how powerful you are.

971
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:51,320
帕特里夏說你方法行不通
Patricia says your way isn't working.

972
01:18:51,390 --> 01:18:54,300
-世人現在會理解的  -丹尼斯
- The world will understand now. - Dennis,

973
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:57,880
這真是大錯特錯
this is an egregious wrong.

974
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:02,900
這些女孩們正在受苦  這是犯罪
These young women are suffering. This is a crime.

975
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:05,210
我不能讓你把她們關在這兒
I can't let you keep them here.

976
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:09,410
我們得阻止這一切  這個人格很惡毒
We've got to stop this. This identity is monstrous.

977
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:11,410
你這樣覺得  我很抱歉
I'm really sad you feel this way.

978
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:12,730
你不明白嗎
Can't you see?

979
01:19:12,730 --> 01:19:16,450
就是因為你在這里待著  他才形成了
He is formed because of your time in this place.

980
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:44,730
剛剛有位女士
There's a lady.

981
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:47,180
有人來了
Someone's here!

982
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:51,320
我們得逃出去
We need to get out of these rooms!

983
01:19:53,650 --> 01:19:56,670
房間里有什么東西嗎  任何我們能用的東西
Is there anything in the room? Anything that we could use?

984
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,960
什么也沒有
There's nothing in here.

985
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,240
這兒有個鉤子
There is a hanger.

986
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:35,760
謝謝你  丹尼斯
Thank you, Dennis.

987
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:39,000
給您  先生
Here you go, sir.

988
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:59,440
剛才聽起來
It sounded like there were slide bolts

989
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,300
我們門外應該是滑閂
on the outside of our doors.

990
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:04,780
你試試看能不能通過門的縫隙把鎖打開
See if you can move the lock through the crack in the door.

991
01:22:01,770 --> 01:22:03,390
{\an8}網絡無法連接

992
01:22:14,050 --> 01:22:16,750
保持冷靜  我們能出去的
Stay calm. We're getting out of here.

993
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:18,330
我們能找到凱茜
We're gonna get Casey.

994
01:22:19,790 --> 01:22:21,470
你能做到  瑪西亞
You can do this, Marcia.

995
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:55,790
{\an8}1  巴里  2  杰德  3  奧威爾

996
01:22:55,790 --> 01:22:57,160
{\an8}3  奧威爾

997
01:22:57,160 --> 01:23:06,950
{\an8}印度歷史

998
01:22:57,460 --> 01:22:58,880
就像是卡哈馬那王朝[7世紀-12世紀]被打敗
It's regarded to Chahamana's defeat

999
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:03,630
以及古爾的穆罕默德從1192到1200年間的征服
and Muhammad of Ghor's conquests between 1192 and 1200.

1000
01:23:04,290 --> 01:23:07,840
我想把它比作穆罕穆德厚顏無恥的最后通牒
I would liken it to Muhammad's brazen ultimatum,

1001
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:11,520
普利維拉"要么放棄信仰要么戰斗"
that Prithviraj "either apostatize or fight".

1002
01:23:13,210 --> 01:23:16,210
就像普利維拉的反抗
Like Prithviraj's defiance...

1003
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:19,150
面對"群"的進攻  我們應該奮起反抗
we should stand up to the horde's advances.

1004
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:24,370
面對他們的恐嚇戰術  我們應該表現出
In the face of their scare tactics, we should show...

1005
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:24,130
{\an8}杰德

1006
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:27,110
我恨胰島素注射
I hate my insulin shots.

1007
01:23:27,950 --> 01:23:29,780
這里其他人都不需要注射胰島素
No one else around here has to take them.

1008
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:32,260
為什么就我有糖尿病
Why do I have to have diabetes?

1009
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,820
所有的醫生  包括弗萊徹醫生
All the doctors, besides Dr. Fletcher,

1010
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:40,690
都說我們就是一個人的不同人格
say that we're the same person, just personalities.

1011
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:43,690
那你怎么解釋只有我需要這破玩意兒
How do you explain I'm the only one that needs this?

1012
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:45,330
你個狗娘養的
You motherfu...

1013
01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:49,220
{\an8}巴里

1014
01:23:50,330 --> 01:23:52,630
我穿著九十年代的工裝褲
I'm wearing cargo pants from the 90s.

1015
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:54,780
還有條圍巾
And a scarf.

1016
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:57,620
如果不是里面穿著名設計師的T恤
If it wasn't for the Varvatos T-shirt underneath,

1017
01:23:57,620 --> 01:23:59,250
那我就丑死了
I'd be a mess.

1018
01:24:00,690 --> 01:24:02,470
我現在一點品味都沒有了
I got no taste for things right now.

1019
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:07,250
我很擔心
I'm worried sick.

1020
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:11,060
我有著失去時間的不祥預感
I have a very bad feeling that I'm losing time.

1021
01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:13,240
我能決定誰得到表現機會  不是嗎
I decide who gets the light, right?

1022
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:18,220
有人正趁我不注意  偷走我的表現機會
I think someone is stealing the light from me when I'm not aware.

1023
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:22,900
"群"一直執著于那些沒受過苦的人
The horde keeps obsessing about the ones who haven't suffered.

1024
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:25,340
我不知道他們這樣下去會怎樣
I don't know where they're going with this,

1025
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:27,160
但我感到很害怕
but it scares me.

1026
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,020
想象著再過幾個小時你就在家了
Picture yourself in a couple hours at home.

1027
01:25:31,810 --> 01:25:33,000
窩在沙發里
On the couch,

1028
01:25:34,210 --> 01:25:36,570
穿著你喜歡的那件丑汗衫
in that ugly-ass sweatshirt that you love.

1029
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:49,340
那是只動物
It's an animal.

1030
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:52,930
他叫得好像遇到了土狼之類的似的
He goes like this if there's a coyote or something.

1031
01:27:32,910 --> 01:27:35,690
凱文  凱文  凱文
Kev.. Kev.. Kev..

1032
01:27:36,510 --> 01:27:38,570
凱文
Kev..

1033
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:04,900
謝謝你
Thank you

1034
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:09,080
一直以來的幫助
for helping us till now.

1035
01:28:15,250 --> 01:28:17,160
凱文  凱文
Kev.. Kev..

1036
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:18,190
我想我該告訴弗萊徹醫生
I guess I should tell Dr. Fletcher about this, but...

1037
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:22,290
但她會擔心的  她是個大好人
She'll worry. She is such a sweet woman.

1038
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:27,720
我應該去好好散個步
I believe I will go for a nice walk

1039
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:32,110
系統地想想這件事
and think this through organizationally.

1040
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:38,850
這就是我周一的日記
Thus ends my journal for Monday.

1041
01:29:38,970 --> 01:29:40,110
再見
Ciao.

1042
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:02,310
克萊爾
Claire?

1043
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:06,710
瑪西亞
Marcia?

1044
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:32,920
克萊爾  克萊爾我們快走
Claire! Claire, let's go!

1045
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,050
凱文·溫德爾·克拉姆
Kevin Wendell Crumb?

1046
01:33:19,020 --> 01:33:20,290
凱文·溫德爾·克拉姆
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1047
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:24,980
凱文·溫德爾·克拉姆
Kevin Wendell Crumb!

1048
01:33:36,890 --> 01:33:38,680
凱文·溫德爾·克拉姆
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1049
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:42,750
凱文·溫德爾·克拉姆
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1050
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:44,860
你闖禍了
You made a mess.

1051
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:47,290
滾出來
Come out here.

1052
01:33:50,090 --> 01:33:53,860
凱文·溫德爾·克拉姆  你闖禍了
Kevin Wendell Crumb! You made a mess!

1053
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:55,570
滾出來
Get out there!

1054
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:25,310
你是誰  發生了什么
Who are you? Wha... what's happening?

1055
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:29,430
一些可怕的事情
Something horrible.

1056
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:32,600
我做了什么
What'd I do?

1057
01:34:34,810 --> 01:34:35,940
我傷害你了嗎
Did I hurt you?

1058
01:34:44,530 --> 01:34:47,770
弗萊徹醫生  弗萊徹醫生
Dr. Fletcher. Dr. Fletcher!

1059
01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:51,190
這是誰干的
Who did that?

1060
01:34:53,850 --> 01:34:54,850
你干的
You did.

1061
01:34:55,730 --> 01:34:57,810
我發誓  我正在公車上
I swear I was on a bus.

1062
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:01,090
之后什么事我都不記得了  我
I don't remember anything after that. I...

1063
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:05,670
現在還是2014年9月18號  是嗎
This is still September 18, 2014, right?

1064
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:18,410
我買了一支獵槍
There's a shotgun I bought.

1065
01:35:18,510 --> 01:35:22,410
就在一堆雜物后面最底下的柜子里
It's in the bottom cabinet, hidden behind things.

1066
01:35:22,710 --> 01:35:25,680
子彈在供電間里的我的制服柜里
The shells are in my uniform closet, out in the service wall.

1067
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:29,940
殺了我
Kill me.

1068
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:35,070
然后殺了我
Then kill me.

1069
01:35:41,370 --> 01:35:43,940
等一下等一下  不要這么做
Wait, wait, wait! No, no, don't do that!

1070
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:45,590
他無法面對現實
He can't handle reality.

1071
01:35:46,270 --> 01:35:47,210
我叫杰德
My name is Jade.

1072
01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:49,580
弗萊徹醫生收到我們的郵件了嗎
Has Dr. Fletcher been getting our emails?

1073
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:51,250
我們必須要這樣做  我們可以...
This is what we have to do. We can...

1074
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:54,070
在1008年
As in 1008,

1075
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:54,070
{\an8}喀布爾-夏希王朝歷史
該王朝位于現今阿富汗和巴基斯坦一帶

1076
01:35:54,070 --> 01:35:57,810
當安納達佩拉慘遭夏希王朝最毀滅性的戰敗
when Anandapala suffered the shahis' most crushing defeat

1077
01:35:57,810 --> 01:36:01,310
而馬哈茂德統治了整個旁遮普
and Mahmud overran the entirety of the Punjab Region,

1078
01:36:01,310 --> 01:36:04,100
占領了著名康格拉神廟的時候
taking the famed Temple of Kangra,

1079
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:07,140
我們被"群"錯怪了
we have been wronged by this alliance,

1080
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:10,350
帕特里夏  丹尼斯還有那個男孩
this horde of Patricia, Dennis and the boy.

1081
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:13,010
他們的行為不代表我們
Their actions do not represent us!

1082
01:36:13,010 --> 01:36:15,140
他們...
They... are every...

1083
01:36:15,810 --> 01:36:18,350
你們大家都冷靜一下
Everybody, just take a minute!

1084
01:36:19,530 --> 01:36:20,790
小姑娘...
Baby girl...

1085
01:36:21,410 --> 01:36:23,290
他們一直都從我手里偷走表現機會
They've been stealing control of the light from me,

1086
01:36:23,290 --> 01:36:26,130
但我們團隊會解決這個問題的
but the group are gonna work through this.

1087
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:28,630
親愛的  我叫巴里
Honey, my name is Barry.

1088
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:40,650
你不該用那個對講機的
You shouldn't have used the walkie-talkies.

1089
01:36:44,580 --> 01:36:46,250
他們差點就抓住我們了
They almost caught us.

1090
01:36:47,950 --> 01:36:49,550
別這樣  黑德維希
Stop it, Hedwig!

1091
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:51,100
他們說得對
They were right.

1092
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:54,810
看看你  你多害怕我們啊
Look at you! You're so frightened of us.

1093
01:36:56,180 --> 01:37:00,060
丹尼斯和帕特里夏女士是因為我才能得到控制權的
Dennis and Ms. Patricia are in charge because of me!

1094
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:02,470
我現在要把表現機會給他們了
I'm gonna give the light to them now.

1095
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:06,980
再沒有人能夠嘲笑我了
No one's allowed to make fun of me anymore!

1096
01:37:19,530 --> 01:37:20,760
謝謝你  黑德維希
Thank you, Hedwig.

1097
01:37:26,070 --> 01:37:27,700
現在沒事了
Everything's fine now.

1098
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:29,570
凱文·溫德爾·克拉姆
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1099
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:35,620
凱文睡著了  我們讓他在很遠處睡著了
Kevin is asleep. We've made him sleep far away.

1100
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:38,940
你想叫他就叫吧  親愛的  但...
You can call his name all you like, dear, but...

1101
01:37:38,940 --> 01:37:40,390
他聽不到你說話的
he's not going to hear you.

1102
01:37:41,620 --> 01:37:44,340
野獸給我們看了他的夢想
The beast has shared with us his dream

1103
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:47,890
想要有更多人來維持他的存在
of a larger group to sustain him.

1104
01:37:48,170 --> 01:37:49,130
不
No!

1105
01:37:49,370 --> 01:37:53,820
下一次就用十到二十個沒用的年輕人
Ten to twelve unworthy young next time.

1106
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:54,900
不  不  
No, no...

1107
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:59,520
這僅僅是開始
This is just the start!

1108
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:31,380
{\an8}克拉姆

1109
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:20,730
放開我
Let go!

1110
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:40,300
我的天哪
Oh, my God!

1111
01:39:55,660 --> 01:39:57,350
救命
Help!

1112
01:39:59,350 --> 01:40:02,510
救命  救命  救命
Help! Help! Help!

1113
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:08,980
不
No.

1114
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:25,600
這是家族遺傳的
It runs in our family.

1115
01:40:26,770 --> 01:40:28,500
我爸爸也去世了
My daddy died, too.

1116
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:32,310
也是這樣  心臟病發
Same way, heart attack.

1117
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,370
不過你不用擔心  我會好好照顧你的
But you don't need to worry. I'm going to take care of you.

1118
01:40:42,110 --> 01:40:46,780
你不會給我惹什么麻煩的  對吧
Now, you won't be giving me any trouble, will you?

1119
01:40:47,990 --> 01:40:49,600
我知道你不會的  寶貝
I know you won't, sweetie.

1120
01:41:11,380 --> 01:41:14,400
我們真是太美了
We are glorious!

1121
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:18,550
我們不再會害怕了
We will no longer be afraid!

1122
01:41:28,450 --> 01:41:31,580
只有通過痛苦
Only through pain...

1123
01:41:32,930 --> 01:41:35,900
你才能實現自身的偉大
can you achieve your greatness!

1124
01:41:51,860 --> 01:41:55,870
純潔者是未被染指
The impure are the untouched,

1125
01:41:56,020 --> 01:41:59,770
未受火侵  未被殺害的
the unburned, the unslain!

1126
01:42:02,940 --> 01:42:05,830
那些沒受過折磨的人
Those who have not been torn,

1127
01:42:05,970 --> 01:42:09,320
自身沒什么意義
have no value in themselves

1128
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:13,010
在這世上也無立足之地
and no place in this world!

1129
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:17,010
他們都睡著了
They are asleep!

1130
01:42:38,390 --> 01:42:42,270
你的槍傷不了我
Your gun cannot hurt me.

1131
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:46,840
你看不出來嗎  我不是人類
Can't you see? I am not human.

1132
01:42:48,470 --> 01:42:52,660
凱文是個人類  我比他強多了
Kevin is a man. I am much more.

1133
01:44:24,020 --> 01:44:28,080
你和其他人不一樣
You... you are different from the rest.

1134
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:41,770
你的心是純潔的
Your heart is pure.

1135
01:44:43,290 --> 01:44:46,800
太棒了
Rejoice!

1136
01:44:51,370 --> 01:44:55,820
受過傷的人才更高等
The broken are the more evolved!

1137
01:45:01,350 --> 01:45:04,310
太棒了
Rejoice!

1138
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:07,160
我的老天爺啊
What in the name of Mary Joseph!

1139
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:10,580
你在這里干什么
What are you doing in this area?

1140
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:55,270
繼續走  寶貝  它們不會傷害你的
Just keep walking, honey. They won't do nothing.

1141
01:47:31,390 --> 01:47:33,720
文斯  報警
Vince, call the police!

1142
01:47:34,290 --> 01:47:37,490
她說在下面維修區有人受傷了
She said some people got hurt in the area below maintenance.

1143
01:47:58,650 --> 01:47:59,550
好了
Okay.

1144
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:04,470
我給你檢查一下
Now, I'm just gonna check you.

1145
01:48:25,410 --> 01:48:27,590
{\an8}黑德維希

1146
01:48:45,780 --> 01:48:48,400
第三名死者為卡倫·弗萊徹醫生
Third deceased-- name of Dr. Karen Fletcher.

1147
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:50,320
我們還在聯系她的家人
Still trying to locate the family.

1148
01:49:08,090 --> 01:49:09,840
凱茜·庫克斯的監護人到了
Casey Cooke's guardian's here.

1149
01:49:20,730 --> 01:49:21,820
你叔叔來了
You uncle's here.

1150
01:49:24,130 --> 01:49:25,150
準備好走了嗎
You ready to go?

1151
01:50:15,380 --> 01:50:16,970
沒成功
It didn't go through.

1152
01:50:22,150 --> 01:50:25,850
我們相信自己是什么就是什么
We are what we believe we are.

1153
01:50:31,510 --> 01:50:36,760
天哪  這也太帥了
Holy shit! This is so cool!

1154
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:42,590
現在他們相信我們存在了吧
They're gonna believe we exist now, right?

1155
01:50:45,350 --> 01:50:46,800
他們必須得相信
They're gotta have to.

1156
01:50:49,660 --> 01:50:51,290
那我們現在該怎么辦
So what are we do now?

1157
01:50:55,250 --> 01:50:56,800
我們相信他  
We trust in him.

1158
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:00,690
他會保護我們的
He'll protect us.

1159
01:51:02,530 --> 01:51:05,800
看看他的能耐
Look at what he can do.

1160
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:11,520
讓他告訴這個世界看看我們能有多強大
Let him show the world how powerful we can be.

1161
01:51:16,060 --> 01:51:19,530
{\an8}分裂

1162
01:51:21,030 --> 01:51:23,530
嫌疑兇手  凱文·克拉姆  患有一種
The suspected murderer, Kevin Crumb,

1163
01:51:23,530 --> 01:51:27,750
富有爭議的心理疾病  分裂型人格障礙
suffers from the controversial psychological disorder, DID.

1164
01:51:27,750 --> 01:51:31,120
現場傳言簡直令人難以置信
The rumors coming out of the scene are almost unbelievable.

1165
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:34,810
人們對于嫌疑人近距離挨了兩槍以后
There are conflicting stories if the suspect is alive or dead

1166
01:51:34,810 --> 01:51:37,830
是生是死還不確定
after sustaining two point-blank gunshots.

1167
01:51:37,830 --> 01:51:40,730
報道甚至稱  他其中一個人格
Reports even indicate one of his personalities

1168
01:51:40,730 --> 01:51:42,880
是一系列動物的混合體
is an amalgam of various animals

1169
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:45,450
就是他工作過的費城動物園里的動物
in the Philadelphia Zoo, where he worked.

1170
01:51:45,450 --> 01:51:46,930
媒體已經開始用
The press is already referring

1171
01:51:46,930 --> 01:51:49,310
知情者透露的一個暗號
to the alleged attacker by a dark name,

1172
01:51:49,310 --> 01:51:51,870
來代指這位受指控的襲擊者
leaked by a source close to the case.

1173
01:51:51,870 --> 01:51:54,060
因為他的多重人格
Because of his many personalities,

1174
01:51:54,060 --> 01:51:56,470
他被稱為"群"
he is being called "the horde".

1175
01:51:57,850 --> 01:51:59,980
這就像那個15年前被關起來的那個奇怪的
This is like that crazy guy in the wheelchair

1176
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:02,100
坐輪椅的人一樣
that they put away 15 years ago.

1177
01:52:02,870 --> 01:52:05,500
他們給他也取了個奇怪的名字
And they gave him a funny name, too.

1178
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:07,380
叫什么來著
What was it?

1179
01:52:08,530 --> 01:52:11,040
-玻璃先生  -對
- Mr. Glass. - Oh, yeah.
