最后警告你一次  你這個小賊
For the last time, you pilfering pest...

138
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,160
不許碰那些不屬于你的東西

139
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,740
我對這一切深表歉意
I'm awfully sorry about all that.

140
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,390
那到底是什么玩意
What the hell was that?

141
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,190
與你無關
Nothing that need concern you.

142

00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,540
你那里面還裝了什么
What else have you got in there?

279
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,470
-是你  -你好啊
- You! - Hello.

280
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,420
悠著點  您是
Easy, Mr...

281
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,410
科瓦斯基  雅各布
Kowalski... Jacob.

282
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,100
你不能對他施一忘皆空
You can't obliviate him!

283
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:53,960
我們需要他當證人
We need him as a witness.

284
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,570
抱歉  但你剛剛還因為我
I'm sorry, you've just yelled at me the length

285
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,870
當時沒有對他施咒嘮叨了我半天啊
of New York for not doing it in the first place.

286
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,550
他受傷了  他看上去很不好
He's hurt! He looks ill!

287
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,180
他會沒事的
He'll be fine.

288
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,690
被莫特拉鼠咬了不嚴重的
Murtlap bites aren't serious.

289
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,740
我承認我還沒見過這么強烈的反應
I admit that is a slightly more severe reaction than I've seen,

290
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,160
但假如真的很嚴重  他會
but if it was really serious, he'd have...

291
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,230
怎樣
What?

292
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,050
首先的癥狀是從肛門噴出火花
Well, the first symptom would be flames out of his anus...

293
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,870
真是一團糟
This is balled up!

294
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,930
最多只會持續48小時
It'll last forty-eight hours at most!

295
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,750
-假如你愿意我可以帶著他  -帶著他
- I can keep him if you want me to. - Oh, keep him?

296
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,310
我們不能帶著他們
We don't keep them!

297
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:25,690
斯卡曼德先生
Mr. Scamander,

298
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:29,650
你對美國的巫師社群有任何的了解嗎
do you know anything about the wizarding community in America?

299
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,150
我確實略有耳聞
I do know a few things, actually.

300
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,780
我知道你們處理巫師和非魔法人士關系的
I know you have rather backwards laws

301
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,570
相關法律還比較落后
about relations with non-magic people.

302
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,980
你們不能和他們做朋友
That you're not meant to befriend them,

303
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,830
不能和他們結婚
that you can't marry them,

304
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,840
這在我看來有些可笑
which seems mildly absurd to me.

305
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,000
誰會愿意和他結婚啊
Who's going to marry him?

306
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,680
你倆都得跟我走
You're both coming with me.

307
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,630
我不明白為什么我也得跟著你
I don't see why I need to come with you.

308
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,680
-搭把手  -我是在做夢吧
- Help me! - I'm dreaming, right?

309
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,720
-拜托了  -沒錯  我累了
- Please. - Yeah, I'm tired,

310
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,190
我就沒去銀行
I never went to the bank.

311
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,490
這只是一場噩夢  對嗎
This is all just some big nightmare, right?

312
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,310
對我也是噩夢  科瓦斯基先生
For the both of us, Mr. Kowalski.

313
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:17,740
{\an8}{\pos(193,35)}神奇魔法

314
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,480
這里就是新聞室了  來吧
And so this is the newsroom. Let's go.

315
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:01,760
你們好  給巴爾博恩一家讓路
Hey, how are you? Make way for the Barebones!

316
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,960
報紙正在進行所謂的上版備印
Now, they're just putting the papers to bed, as they say.

317
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,470
先生  肖先生正在和參議員談話
Mr. Shaw, sir, he's with the senator.

318
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,910
行了  巴克  我要見我父親
Never mind that, Barker, I wanna see my father!

319
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,050
很抱歉  肖先生  但您兒子堅持要進來
I'm so sorry, Mr. Shaw, but your son insisted.

320
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,380
父親  您一定不會想錯過這個的
Father, you're going to want to hear this.

321
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,460
我找到了個大新聞
I've got something huge!

322
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,640
你哥哥和我正忙著呢  蘭登
Your brother and I are busy here, Langdon.

323
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,560
在忙他競選的事
Working on his election campaign.

324
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,130
我們沒時間聽這個
We don't have time for this.

325
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,970
這位是瑪麗·盧·巴爾博恩
This is Mary Lou Barebone

326
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,490
她來自新塞勒姆慈善社
from the New Salem Preservation Society,

327
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,150
她給您帶來了個大新聞
and she's got a big story for you!

328
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,320
可不是嘛
Oh, she has, has she?

329
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,820
全市各處都發生了奇怪的事情
There's strange things going on all over the city.

330
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,690
造成這一切的人  他們和你我不同
The people behind this, they are not like you and me.

331
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,790
這是巫術  您看不出來嗎
This is witchcraft, don't you see.

332
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,180
-蘭登  -她不要報酬
- Langdon. - She doesn't want any money.

333
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,700
那么不是她的故事是假的
Then either her story is worthless,

334
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,040
就是她不要報酬的話是假的
or she's lying about the cost.

335
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,120
沒人會給你免費的午餐  蘭登
Nobody gives away anything valuable for free, Langdon.

336
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,680
您說的沒錯  肖先生
You are right, Mr. Shaw.

337
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,930
我們渴求遠比金錢更寶貴的東西
What we desire is infinitely more valuable than money.

338
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,960
您的影響力
It's your influence.

339
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,110
上百萬人訂閱您發行的報紙
Millions of people read your newspapers

340
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,380
得有人讓他們意識到面前的危機
and they need to be made aware about this danger.

341
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:15,380
地鐵災難事件  您看看照片就知道了
The crazy disturbances in the subway, just look at the pictures!

342
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,550
請你和你的朋友們馬上離開
I'd like you and your friends to leave.

343
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,870
不  你怎么就不明白
No, you're missing a trick here.

344
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,690
-睜眼看看這些事實  -鬧夠了嗎
- Just look at the evidence. - Really.

345
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:25,770
蘭登  聽父親的話  走吧
Langdon, just listen to Father and go. And...

346
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,780
把這些怪胎也一起帶走
Take the freaks with you.

347
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,790
-這是父親的辦公室  不是你的  -好吧
- This is Father's office, not yours. - Okay.

348
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,210
我實在受夠了  每次我一進來
And I'm sick of this every time I walk in here...

349
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:35,340
夠了  麻煩你們離開
That's it. Thank you.

350
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,580
希望您會改變主意  肖先生
We hope you'll reconsider, Mr. Shaw.

351
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,590
我們隨時等候您的消息
We're not difficult to find.

352
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,940
您不來  我們也很感謝您今天見我們
Until then, we thank you for your time.

353
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,820
小子
Hey, boy.

354
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,940
你東西掉了
You dropped something.

355
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,260
拿著  怪胎  扔進垃圾桶吧
Here you go, freak.

356
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,490
那里才是你們該呆的地方
Why don't you put that in the trash where you all belong.

357
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,290
右轉
Take a right here.

358
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,700
進屋之前我得申明
Okay, before we go in...

359
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,170
理論上我不能帶男士回家
I'm not supposed to have men on the premises.

360
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,710
既然如此  科瓦斯基先生和我完全可以去別處休息
In that case, Mr. Kowalski and I can easily seek other accommodation.

361
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,150
不行
Oh no, you don't!

362
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,410
當心腳下
Watch your step.

363
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,010
是你嗎  蒂娜
That you, Tina?

364
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,310
-是  埃斯波西托太太  -一個人嗎
- Yes, Mrs. Esposito! - Are you alone?

365
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,960
一如既往一個人  埃斯波西托太太
I'm always alone, Mrs. Esposito!

366
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,700
蒂妮  你帶了男人回來
Teenie, you brought men home?

367
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:23,340
兩位  這位是我妹妹
Gentlemen, this is my sister.

368
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,560
-加件衣服吧  奎妮  -當然
- You want to put something on, Queenie? - Sure.

369
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:48,960
-他們是誰  -這位是斯卡曼德先生
- So, who are they? - That's Mr. Scamander.

370
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,970
他犯下嚴重罪行
He's committed a serious

371
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,500
違反了《巫師保密法》
infraction of the National Statute of Secrecy.

372
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,970
他是個罪犯嗎
He's a criminal?

373
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,080
這位是科瓦斯基先生  是個麻雞
And this is Mr. Kowalski, he's a No-Maj.

374
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,000
麻雞
A No-Maj?

375
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,100
蒂妮  你要做什么
Teen, what are you up to?

376
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,850
他受傷了  說來話長
He's sick, it's a long story.

377
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,770
斯卡曼德先生丟了東西  我要幫他找回來
Mr. Scamander has lost something, I'm going to help him find it.

378
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:13,300
你得坐下親愛的  他一整天沒吃東西了
You need to sit down, honey. Hey, he hasn't eaten all day.

379
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:19,050
真可憐  銀行沒批準他開點心店的貸款
That's rough, he didn't get the money he wanted for his bakery.

380
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,420
你會做點心呀  親愛的
You bake, honey?

381
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,810
-我可喜歡做飯了  -你是攝神取念者
- I love to cook. - You're a Legilimens?

382
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:29,080
對啊  但碰上你們英國人就有些麻煩
Uh-huh, yeah. But I always have trouble with your kind. Brits.

383
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,720
因為口音的緣故
It's the accent.

384
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,890
-你會讀心術  -別擔心  親愛的
- You know how to read minds? - Don't worry, honey.

385
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,350
男人們第一次見到我跟你想法都一樣
Most guys think what you was thinking, first time they see me.

386
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,960
先給你做吃的
Now, you need food.

387
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,630
-又吃熱狗  -別對我使讀心術
- Hot dog... again? - Don't read my mind!

388
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,600
這午餐不怎么樣哦
Not a very wholesome lunch.

389
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,880
斯卡曼德先生
Hey, Mr. Scamander,

390
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,900
喜歡蘋果餡餅還是薄酥卷餅
you prefer pie or strudel?

391
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,870
我沒什么講究
I really don't have a preference.

392
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,770
你喜歡薄酥卷餅對吧  親愛的
You prefer strudel, huh, honey?

393
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,300
那就做卷餅
Strudel it is.

394
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,060
坐下吧  斯卡曼德先生
Well, sit down, Mr. Scamander.

395
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,550
不會毒死你的
We're not going to poison you.

396
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:39,850
你很難過
You're upset.

397
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,080
你母親又打你了嗎
It's your mother again.

398
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,940
有人說了什么  說了什么  告訴我
Somebody's said something, what did they say? Tell me.

399
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,650
-你覺得我是個怪胎嗎  -不
- Do you think I'm a freak? - No,

400
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,790
我認為你是一位非常特別的年輕人
I think you're a very special young man

401
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:55,880
否則我也不會請你協助我  對嗎
or I wouldn't have asked you to help me, would I?

402
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,530
-有消息了嗎  -我還在找
- Have you any news? - I'm still looking.

403
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,220
格雷夫斯先生  如果能知道性別
Mr. Graves, if I knew whether it was a girl or boy...

404
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,830
我只看到那孩子有巨大的力量
My vision showed only the child's immense power.

405
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,510
性別未知  但肯定不過十歲
He or she is no older than ten,

406
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,830
和你母親很親近
and I saw this child in close proximity to your mother.

407
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,150
你母親我看的真切
She I saw so plainly.

408
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,870
-這樣的人有好幾百  -還有一件事
- That could be any one of hundreds. - There is something else.

409
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,290
之前沒告訴你
Something I haven't told you.

410
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:31,850
我看到你與我在紐約并肩而立
I saw you beside me in New York.

411
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,270
只有你能獲取那孩子的信任
You're the one that gains this child's trust.

412
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:39,180
你是關鍵  我看到了
You are the key, I saw this.

413
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:42,360
你渴望加入魔法師的世界
You want to join the wizarding world.

414
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:46,820
我也是  克雷登斯  我渴望你能加入
I want those things too, Credence. I want them for you.

415
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,950
找到那個孩子  找到了我們就自由了
So find the child. Find the child and we'll all be free.

416
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,030
我的工作沒啥稀奇
The job ain't that glamorous.

417
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,560
整天沖泡咖啡
I mean, I spend most days making coffee,

418
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,200
用用讀心術  蒂娜才是職業女性
unjinxing the john. Tina's the career girl.

419
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,340
不  我們是孤兒
Nah. We're orphans.

420
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,200
父母在我們小時候得龍痘過世了
Ma and Pa died of dragon pox when we were kids.

421
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:16,550
你真貼心  我們倆相依為命也很好
You're sweet. But we got each other!

422
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,350
你能別一直對我用讀心術嗎
Could you stop reading my mind for a second?

423
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,200
別誤會  我很喜歡
Don't get me wrong, I love it.

424
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:31,670
這頓晚餐實在美味無比  我也是廚師
This meal, it's insanely good! This is what I do, I'm a cook.

425
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:36,140
但這是我今生今世吃過最美味的東西
And this is, like, the greatest meal I have ever had in my life.

426
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:44,050
你真迷人  我還是第一次認真和麻雞聊天呢
Oh, you slay me! I ain't never really talked to a No-Maj before.

427
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:46,780
真的嗎
Really?

428
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,330
我沒有在調情
I am not flirting!

429
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,460
我只是提醒你  別陷太深
I'm just saying, don't go getting attached,

430
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,670
最終要給他施遺忘咒的
he's going to have to be obliviated!

431
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,400
這是規矩
It's nothing personal.

432
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,790
-你還好嗎  親愛的  -戈德斯坦恩小姐
- Hey, you okay, honey? - Miss Goldstein,

433
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,820
我想科瓦斯基先生應該早點休息
I think Mr. Kowalski could do with an early night.

434
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,790
而且你和我明天也得早起
And besides, you and I will need to be up early tomorrow morning

435
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,580
去找我的嗅嗅  所以
to find my Niffler, so...

436
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,480
-嗅嗅是什么  -別問了
- What's a Niffler? - Don't ask.

437
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,040
你倆就在這兒加張床睡吧
Okay, you guys can bunk in here.

438
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:44,350
不知道你們想不想喝點熱乎的
I thought you might like a hot drink?

439
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:00,400
斯卡曼德先生  熱可可哎
Hey, Mr. Scamander... Look, cocoa!

440
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:06,470
-廁所在走廊盡頭右拐  -謝謝
- The toilet's down the hall to the right. - Thanks...

441
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,770
非常感謝
Very much.

442
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,080
來啊
Come on.

443
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,400
真是服了
For the love of...

444
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,140
好像有一個jesus

445
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:11,830
-坐下吧  -好主意
- Will you sit down? - Good idea.

446
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,660
肯定是莫特拉鼠咬的了
That's definitely the Murtlap.

447
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,440
你一定是易感體質
You must be particularly susceptible.

448
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,600
因為你是麻瓜  我們體質有些許不同
See, you're a Muggle. So our physiologies are subtly different.

449
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:38,010
別動  這藥能止汗
Stay still. Now that should stop the sweating.

450
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,070
這可以緩解痙攣
And one of those should sort the twitch.

451
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,630
拿好
Take that.

452
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,830
再來點
Come on...

453
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:02,390
-你在弄什么  -當地人管它叫蜷翼魔
- What you got there? - This the locals call Swooping Evil?

454
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,990
名字挺可怕  小家伙很敏捷
Not the friendliest of names. It's quite an agile fellow.

455
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:13,470
我正在研究它  我確信它的毒液
I've been studying him. And I am pretty sure his venom

456
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,670
合理稀釋后其實很有用
could be quite useful if properly diluted.

457
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,470
能消除痛苦的記憶
Just to remove bad memories, you know.

458
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,100
不過還是別在屋里放開它了
Probably shouldn't let him loose in here, though.

459
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:31,630
來吧
Come on.

460
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:49,380
來吧  下來吧
Come on. Down you come.

461
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:56,410
來
Come on.

462
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,140
感謝帕拉塞爾蘇斯
Oh, thank Paracelsus.

463
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,140
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}帕拉塞爾蘇斯  巧克力蛙卡片上出現過的人物
中世紀瑞士醫生  煉金術師  精通毒理學

464
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,840
要是你也跑出去那就天下大亂了
If you'd have got out that could have been quite catastrophic.

465
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,680
我來美國的真正原因就是為了它
You see, he's the real reason I came to America.

466
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,710
我想把弗蘭克帶回故鄉
To bring Frank home.

467
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,900
抱歉  別靠太近  他對陌生人有些敏感
No, sorry, stay there, he's a wee bit sensitive to strangers.

468
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:30,570
乖  乖  它被非法販賣了
Here you are, here you are. He was trafficked, you see.

469
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,800
我在埃及發現的它  全身綁著鎖鏈
I found him in Egypt, he was all chained up.

470
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:37,490
不忍心丟下它不管  我得帶它回家
Couldn't leave him there, had to bring him back.

471
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:40,590
帶你回歸屬之地  對不對  弗蘭克
I'm going to put you back where you belong, aren't I, Frank?

472
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,500
回到亞利桑那大荒野
To the wilds of Arizona.

473
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,980
它們來了
Here they come.

474
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,920
-誰來了  -角駝獸
- Here who comes? - The Graphorns.

475
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,180
沒事  沒事的
You're all right. You're all right.

476
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:37,340
你好  你們好
Hello, hello!

477
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,370
這是現存最后一對能哺育后代的角駝獸
So they're the last breeding pair in existence.

478
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:45,030
如果我沒救回它們
If I hadn't managed to rescue them,

479
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:47,550
角駝獸恐怕就從此滅絕了
that could have been the end of Graphorns, forever.

480
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,810
好啦
All right.

481
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,670
-你專門救治這些動物嗎  -沒錯
- What, you rescue these creatures? - Yes, that's right.

482
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:04,200
救治  養育  保護它們
Rescue, nurture, and protect them,

483
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,800
并試著慢慢給魔法師們灌輸他們的知識
and I'm gently trying to educate my fellow wizards about them.

484
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,680
跟我來
Come on.

485
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,440
泰特斯  芬  波比  馬洛  湯姆
Titus? Finn? Poppy, Marlow, Tom?

486
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,730
他感冒了  需要溫暖的身體
He had a cold. He needed some body warmth.

487
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:32,790
好了  回去吧
Right, on you hop.

488
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,010
他有些粘人  去吧  皮克特
See, he has some attachment issues. Now, come on, Pickett.

489
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:47,030
皮克特  他們不會欺負你的  回去吧
Pickett. No, they're not going to bully you. Now, come on.

490
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,390
皮克特
Pickett!

491
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:55,010
好吧  也難怪他們說我偏心了
All right. But that is exactly why they accuse me of favoritism.

492
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,210
杜戈爾去哪兒了
I wonder where Dougal's gone.

493
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,500
我來了  我來了  媽媽來了
All right, I'm coming, I'm coming, Mum's here. Mum's here.

494
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:08,530
-讓我瞧瞧  -我見過這些小家伙
- Hello, you, let me take a look at you. - I know these guys.

495
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:15,900
-你的鳥蛇  -你說我的鳥蛇
- Your Occamy. - You mean my Occamy?

496
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,150
是的  你想不想
Yes, do you want to...

497
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,440
好啊  當然好
Yeah, sure. Okay.

498
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:33,460
-你好  -抱歉  不要摸
- Hey. - No, sorry, don't pet them.

499
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,840
他們一出生就學會自我保護
They learn to defend themselves early.

500
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,950
因為蛋殼是銀的  非常值錢
See, their shells are made of silver so they're incredibly valuable.

501
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:42,560
-是嗎  -他們的巢總是慘遭獵殺洗劫
- Okay. - Their nests tend to get ransacked by hunters.

502
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,690
謝謝
Thank you.

503
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,550
-斯卡曼德先生  -叫我紐特吧
- Mr. Scamander? - Call me Newt.

504
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,370
紐特  我覺得我不是在做夢
Newt, I don't think I'm dreaming.

505
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:55,870
-怎么看出來的  -我可沒這想象力
- What gave it away? - I ain't got the brains to make this up.

506
00:42:58,910 --> 00:42:59,720
不介意幫個忙吧
Actually, would you mind

507
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,360
把這些喂給那邊的月癡獸
throwing some of those pellets in with the Mooncalves over there?

508
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,370
-好的  -就在那邊
- Yeah, sure. - Just over there...

509
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:14,760
倒霉  嗅嗅跑了  就知道  搗蛋鬼
Bugger, Niffler's gone. Of course he has, little bugger.

510
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:17,510
不會放過任何閃亮亮的東西
Any chance to get his hands on something shiny.

511
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:56,500
今天干嘛了  雅各布
What did you do today, Jacob?

512
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,650
我去一個皮箱里玩了
I was inside a suitcase.

513
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:03,640
你們好  小家伙們  來吧  來吧
Hey. Hello, fellas. All right, all right.

514
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:06,840
慢慢吃  慢慢吃
Take it easy, take it easy.

515
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:18,270
真可愛  給你
Cutie. There it is.

516
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,400
-退后  -老天
- Step back. - Jeez...

517
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:09,950
-退后  -這是怎么回事
- Step back. - What's the matter with this?

518
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:12,300
-我說  退后  -知道了
- I said step away. - Yeah.

519
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:17,160
-這是什么鬼東西  -這是默默然
- What the hell is this thing? - It's an Obscurus.

520
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,600
我得出發了
I need to get going,

521
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,670
在跑掉的受傷前得趕緊找回來
find everyone who's escaped before they get hurt.

522
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:23,620
該擔心的真是他們嗎
Before they could get hurt?

523
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:27,130
沒錯  科瓦斯基先生  他們身處異鄉
Yes, Mr. Kowalski. They're currently in alien terrain,

524
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:28,050
四周圍繞著成千上萬
surrounded by millions

525
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,150
這個星球上最險惡的生物
of the most vicious creatures on the planet.

526
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:33,610
人類
Humans.

527
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,450
依你看來  一個中等體型
So where would you say that a medium-sized creature

528
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,740
喜歡開闊平原
that likes broad, open plains,

529
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:44,500
樹林和水坑的生物  她會去哪兒
trees, water holes, that kind of thing, where might she go?

530
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,730
在紐約市嗎
In New York City?

531
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,520
-對  -喜歡平原
- Yes. - Plains?

532
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:51,630
-中央公園  -在哪兒
- Central Park? - And where is that exactly?

533
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,240
你不知道中央公園在哪兒
Where is Central Park?

534
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:00,770
我是很樂意為你帶路
Well, look, I would come and show you,

535
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:03,020
但你不覺得有點對不起兩位女士嗎
but don't you think it's kind of a double cross?

536
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:06,070
人家收留我們  還給我們喝熱可可
The girls take us in, they make us hot cocoa.

537
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:07,810
你知道一旦你痊愈了
You do realize that when they see you've stopped sweating,

538
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:09,370
她們轉眼就會對你施遺忘咒對吧
they'll obliviate you in a heartbeat.

539
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:10,350
什么是遺忘咒
What does obliviate Mean?

540
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,510
就像夢醒  關于魔法的記憶消失不見
It'll be like you wake up and all memory of magic is gone.

541
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,880
-這一切我都會忘掉嗎  -沒錯
- I won't remember any of this? - No.

542
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:27,870
好吧  我幫你
All right, yeah, okay, I'll help you.

543
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:33,910
那走吧
Come on, then.

544
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:54,320
克雷登斯  你去哪兒了
Credence, where have you been?

545
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:59,310
我在找明天集會的場地
I was looking for a place for tomorrow's meeting.

546
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,180
32街上有塊地方我們可以
There's a corner on Thirty-Second Street that could...

547
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:16,220
對不起  媽媽  我沒注意到這么晚了
I'm sorry, Ma. I didn't realize it was so late.

548
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:12,520
-晚飯時我在觀察你  -然后呢
- I was watching you at dinner. - Yeah.

549
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:15,710
你很討人喜歡  對吧  科瓦斯基先生
People like you, don't they, Mr. Kowalski?

550
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:20,440
你肯定也很討人喜歡
Well, I'm sure people like you too.

551
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,190
不  我總是討人嫌
No, not really. I annoy people.

552
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,740
你為什么要做點心師呢
Why did you decide to be a baker?

553
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:32,790
因為我在罐頭廠呆的快要窒息了
Well, because I'm dying in that canning factory.

554
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:34,010
那的人都是行尸走肉
Everyone there's dying.

555
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:36,560
那里能活生生把你的意志榨干
It just crushes the life outta you.

556
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,690
-你喜歡罐頭食品嗎  -不喜歡
- You like canned food? - No.

557
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,020
我也不喜歡  所以我想做手工點心
Yeah. Me neither. That's why I want to make pastries, you know.

558
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,510
吃點心讓人開心  這邊走
It makes people happy. We're going this way.

559
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:46,410
那你拿到貸款了嗎
So did you get your loan?

560
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:50,700
沒  我沒東西作抵押
No, I ain't got no collateral.

561
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:53,100
或許是在部隊呆太久了  誰知道呢
Stayed in the army too long, apparently, I don't know.

562
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,450
-你打過仗嗎  -當然打過
- You fought in the war? - Of course I fought in the war,

563
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:57,860
人人都打過仗  你難道沒有嗎
everyone fought in the war. You didn't fight in the war?

564
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:01,070
我主要和龍打交道  烏克蘭鐵腹龍
I worked mostly with dragons, Ukrainian Ironbellies,

565
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,540
東線戰場
Eastern Front.

566
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:33,140
玻璃破碎
Finestra.

567
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:37,140
速速飛來
Accio!

568
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,930
這下高興了
All right? Happy?

569
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,930
找到一個  還剩倆
One down, two to go.

570
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:17,990
-犯人朝那跑了  警官  -舉起手來
- They went that way, Officer. - Hands up!

571
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:23,130
那是什么
What the hell is that?

572
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,040
獅子
Lion...

573
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:41,170
紐約比我想象中好玩多了
You know, New York is considerably more interesting than I'd expected.

574
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:58,650
戴上
Put this on.

575
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,320
我為什么需要戴這種東西
Why would I have to wear something like this?

576
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,580
因為你的腦袋
Because your skull is

577
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,780
在巨大沖擊之下很容易開花
susceptible to breakage under immense force.

578
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,490
但我們還給他們做了熱可可呢
But we made them cocoa.

579
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,340
好了
Right.

580
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:40,700
-不如把這也穿上吧  -好的
- Okay, if you just, pop this on. - Okay.

581
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,620
這下真的沒啥可擔心的了
Now, there's absolutely nothing for you to worry about.

582
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:45,180
你說不用擔心時
Tell me, has anyone ever

583
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,330
真的有人相信你過嗎
believed you when you told them not to worry?

584
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:50,650
我始終認為  擔心就是雙重遭罪
My philosophy is that worrying means you suffer twice.

585
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:59,740
季節到了  她需要交配
She's in season. She needs to mate.

586
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:07,450
毒角獸麝香  對她最有吸引力
Erumpent musk, she is mad for it.

587
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:17,350
好姑娘
Good girl...

588
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:21,360
來吧  到箱子里去
Come on, into the case.

589
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:32,650
討厭
Get...

590
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:39,900
糟糕
Oh, no.

591
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,550
修復如初
Repar...

592
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:14,100
梅林的胡子啊
Merlin's beard!

593
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:22,170
這兩根一模一樣
They're exactly the same.

594
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,910
-一模一樣  -紐特
- Same thing. - Newt!

595
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,580
別  別
No, no, no, don't!

596
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:34,800
非常抱歉
I'm so sorry.

597
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:34,610
干得漂亮  科瓦斯基先生
Good show, Mr. Kowalski!

598
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,140
叫我雅各布吧
Call me Jacob.

599
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,790
抓了倆  還剩一個
Two down, one to go.

600
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:56,740
你先進吧
In you hop.

601
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,620
女士們先生們
Ladies and gentlemen,

602
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:18,040
今晚的主要發言人
tonight's keynote speaker,

603
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:20,980
無需我過多介紹
needs no introduction from me.

604
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:25,040
{\an8}{\pos(193,35)}肖
美國的未來

605
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,570
他被譽為未來的總統
He's been mentioned as a future president.

606
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:27,140
不信的話
And if you don't believe me,

607
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:29,230
看看他父親的報紙就知道了
just read his daddy's newspapers.

608
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:33,810
女士們先生們
Ladies and gentlemen,

609
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:36,340
讓我隆重為你們介紹紐約的參議員
I'll give you the senator for New York,

610
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:38,570
亨利·肖
Henry Shaw!

611
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:44,970
謝謝您
Thank you.

612
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:47,530
謝謝大家
Thank you!

613
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:53,100
謝謝
Thank you.

614
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:21,650
某些方面我們的確取得了不小的進步
And it's true we have made some progress,

615
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:25,500
但游手好閑是不可能有回報的
but there is no reward for idleness.

616
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:29,870
當那些烏煙瘴氣的酒吧被取締之后
So just as the odious saloons have been banished...

617
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:29,870
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}此時為1926年
正處于美國禁酒令時期

618
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:37,670
出什么事了
What's going on?

619
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:47,580
至于那些釀酒廠
So now the pool halls,

620
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:49,940
和私人作坊
and these private parlors...

621
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:03,500
那是什么
What is that?

622
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,120
女巫
Witches!

623

我們的美國同僚

626
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:08,100
對有人違背了《保密法》視而不見
permitted a breach of the Statute of Secrecy,

627
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:11,220
使整個魔法世界面臨暴露的威脅
that threatens to expose us all.

628
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:13,220
我不想聽
I will not be lectured by the man

629
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:14,530
眼睜睜放走了蓋勒特·格林德沃的人
who let Gellert Grindelwald

630
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:15,520
來教訓我
slip through his fingers.

631
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,280
會長女士  很抱歉打擾您
Madam President, I'm so sorry to interrupt,

632
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,290
但這事十萬火急
but this is critical.

633
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:34,220
你這樣魯莽的擅自闖入
You'd better have an excellent

634

最好有個合理理由  戈德斯坦恩小姐
excuse for this intrusion, Miss Goldstein.

635
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:39,510
是的  我有
Yes, I do.

636
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:47,550
女士  昨天一個帶手提箱的巫師來了紐約
Madam. Yesterday a wizard entered New York with a case.

637
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:50,130
箱子里全是神奇生物
This case full of magical creatures,

638
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:52,380
很不幸的是  有一些逃脫了
and unfortunately, some have escaped.

639
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:54,270
他昨天到的嗎
He arrived yesterday?

640
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:57,950
你24小時前就知道
You have known for twenty-four hours

641
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:01,880
一個未登記的巫師在紐約放跑了魔法生物
that an unregistered wizard set magical beasts loose in New York.

642
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,040
卻等到有人遇害了才告訴我們嗎
and you see fit to tell us only when a man has been killed?

643
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:10,620
-誰被殺了  -他在哪
- Who has been killed? - Where is this man?

644
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:52,830
斯卡曼德
Scamander?

645
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,250
您好  部長大人
Hello, Minister.

646
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:59,000
忒修斯·斯卡曼德  那個一戰英雄
Theseus Scamander? The war hero?

647
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,510
不  這是他弟弟
No, this is his little brother.

648
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:03,860
你來紐約干什么
And what are you doing in New York?

649
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:06,850
-買阿帕魯薩蒲絨絨  先生  -我信了
- I came to buy an Appaloosa Puffskein, sir.- Right.

650
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,130
你來這里真正的目的是什么
What are you really doing here?

651
01:02:10,270 --> 01:02:13,000
戈德斯坦恩  這又是誰
Goldstein, and who is this?

652
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:15,440
他叫雅各布·科瓦斯基  會長女士
This is Jacob Kowalski, Madam President,

653
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:18,100
他是被斯卡曼德先生的動物咬了的麻雞
he's a No-Maj who got bitten by one of Mr. Scamander's creatures.

654
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:20,310
-麻雞  -施遺忘咒了嗎
- No-Maj? - Obliviated?

01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:21,690
抹掉他的記憶
Obliviate him!

656
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:27,160
梅林的胡子啊
Merlin's beard.

657
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,000
您知道您的哪只動物該為此負責嗎
You know which of your creatures was responsible,

658
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,280
斯卡曼德先生
Mr. Scamander?

659
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:38,150
這不是動物干的
No creature did this.

660
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:40,700
別裝了
Don't pretend!

661
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,940
你們知道那是什么  看傷痕就知道
You must know what that was, look at the marks...

662
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:49,890
這是默默然干的
That was an Obscurus.

663
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:55,130
滿口胡言  斯卡曼德先生
You go too far, Mr. Scamander.

664
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:58,620
在美國絕對沒有默默然
There is no Obscurial in America.

665
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:03,310
扣押他的箱子  格雷夫斯
Impound that case, Graves!

666
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:05,990
-等等  別  還給我  -逮捕他們
- Wait. No. Give that back. - Arrest them!

01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:12,530
別傷害那些動物
Don't hurt those creatures.

668
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:14,170
求您了  您不理解
Please, you don't understand,

669
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:16,400
他們都不危險的  都不危險
nothing in there is dangerous, nothing!

670
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,100
我們自會判斷  押他們去監獄
We'll be the judges of that! Take them to the cells!

671
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:24,120
別傷害這些動物  他們都不危險的
Don't hurt those creatures, nothing in there is dangerous!

They aren't dangerous! Please, they are not dangerous!

674
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,020
他們不會傷害人的
They are not dangerous!

675
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:41,680
關于你的動物我很抱歉  斯卡曼德先生
I am so sorry about your creatures, Mr. Scamander.

676
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:43,710
真的
I truly am.

677
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:46,550
誰能告訴我
Can someone please tell me

678
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:50,120
這個默然者還是默默然到底是什么
what this Obscurial or Obscurus thing is? Please?

679
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:54,640
幾百年都沒有出現過了
There hasn't been one for centuries.

680
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:58,450
三個月前我在蘇丹遇到了一個
I met one in Sudan three months ago.

681
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:03,430
雖然以前更多  但現在也還有
There used to be more of them but they still exist.

682
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:09,460
那時巫師們還未隱遁
Before wizards went underground,

683
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:12,960
我們還在被麻瓜們追殺
when we were still being hunted by Muggles,

684
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:15,590
有時為了逃脫厄運
young wizards and witches

685
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:19,760
年輕的巫師們會抑制自己的魔法力量
sometimes tried to suppress their magic to avoid persecution.

686
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:24,900
但他們并未學會駕馭和控制他們的力量
Instead of learning to harness or to control their powers,

687
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:28,940
反而衍生了所謂的默默然
they developed what was called an Obscurus.

688
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:34,290
這是種極不穩定  難以控制的黑魔法
It's an unstable, uncontrollable Dark force

689
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:36,380
會脫離宿主然后攻擊他人
that busts out and attacks...

690
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:41,170
之后便消失得無影無蹤
and then vanishes.

691
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:47,390
默然者活不久的  對吧
Obscurials can't survive long, can they?

692
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:48,830
沒有任何案例表明
There's no documented case

693
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:51,760
默然者能活過十歲
of any Obscurial surviving past the age of ten.

694
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:55,770
我在非洲遇到的小女孩當時才...
The one I met in Africa was eight when she...

695
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,970
她離世時才八歲
She was eight when she died.

696
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:07,470
所以你們的意思是
What are you telling me here,

697
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:11,010
參議員肖是被一個小孩殺死的
that Senator Shaw was killed by a kid?

698
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:19,650
我媽媽  你媽媽  騎著掃帚飛
My momma, your momma, flying on a switch.

699
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:23,440
我媽媽  你媽媽  女巫不哭呀
My momma, your momma, witches never cry.

700
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:27,310
我媽媽  你媽媽  女巫死光啦
My momma, your momma, witches gonna die!

701
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:31,020
第一個女巫  河水淹死她
Witch number one, drown in a river!

702
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,750
第二個女巫  繩子吊死她
Witch number two, gotta noose to give her!

703
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:36,550
-該發傳單了  -第三個女巫
- Hand out your leaflets! - Witch number three...

704
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:38,340
你們扔掉的話我會知道的
I'll know if you dump them.

705
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:41,790
看到可疑的東西記得告訴我
Tell me if you see anything suspicious.

706
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:13,760
能認識你很高興  雅各布
It was good to make your acquaintance,Jacob

707
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:16,080
希望你的點心屋能夠順利開張
and I hope you get your bakery.

708
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:29,240
您很有意思  斯卡曼德先生
You're an interesting man, Mr. Scamander.

709
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:30,550
格雷夫斯先生
Mr. Graves...

710
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:42,640
當年因威脅他人生命被霍格沃茨開除
You were thrown out of Hogwarts for endangering human life...

711
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:45,370
-那是個意外  -還是動物引起的吧
- That was an accident! - With a beast.

712
01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:49,370
然而你的一位老師強烈反對開除你
Yet one of your teachers argued strongly against your expulsion.

713
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:50,510
現在走到了這步田地
And now...

714
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:56,880
阿不思·鄧布利多為什么這么喜歡你
What makes Albus Dumbledore so fond of you?

715
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:56,880
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}鄧布利多曾擔任變形課教授

716
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:03,800
我真的不知道
I really couldn't say.

717
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:07,000
所以在這里放出一只危險的生物
So setting a pack of dangerous creatures loose here was...

718
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:13,150
也是一場意外  是嗎
Was just another accident, is that right?

719
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:15,160
我故意這么做能有什么好處
Why would I do it deliberately?

720
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:16,980
能曝光巫師世界
To expose wizardkind.

721
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:21,470
挑起魔法世界和人類世界的戰爭
To provoke war between the magical and non-magical worlds.

722
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,550
你的意思是以大屠殺來成全大局嗎
Mass slaughter for the greater good, you mean?

723
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,550
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}格林德沃信徒的口號

724
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:30,460
是的  就這個意思
Yes. Quite.

725
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,370
我不是格林德沃的信徒  格雷夫斯先生
I'm not one of Grindelwald's fanatics, Mr. Graves.

726
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:43,400
關于這個你有什么話說  斯卡曼德先生
I wonder what you can tell me about this, Mr. Scamander?

727
01:07:57,910 --> 01:08:01,240
這是只默默然  但不是你想的那樣
It's an Obscurus. But it's not what you think so.

728
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,190
救那個蘇丹女孩的時候
I managed to separate it from the Sudanese girl

729
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:04,650
我試著把它分離了出來
from the Sudanese girl as I tried to save her.

730
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:06,820
我只想帶回家做研究
Wanted to take it home, to study it.

731
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:08,270
但離開標本泡它是無法存活的
But it cannot survive outside that,

732
01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:10,290
它無法傷害任何人了  蒂娜
it could not hurt anyone, Tina!

733
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:12,110
所以離了宿主這東西就沒用了
So it's useless without the host?

734
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:17,290
"沒用了"  "沒用了"
"Useless?" "Useless?"

735
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:24,110
能致一個孩子于死地的寄生魔法力量
That is a parasitical magical force that killed a child.

736
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:26,000
你覺得它能有什么用
What on earth would you use it for?

737
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:34,650
你騙不了任何人  斯卡曼德先生
You fool nobody, Mr. Scamander.

738
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:36,080
你把默默然帶到紐約來
You brought this Obscurus into the

739
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,810
就是希望進行大規模屠殺
city of New York in the hope of causing mass disruption,

740
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:41,470
破壞《保密法》  曝光巫師世界
breaking the Statute of Secrecy and revealing the magical world.

741
01:08:41,470 --> 01:08:43,320
你知道它不能傷人的  你明明知道
You know that can't hurt anyone, you know that!

742
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:45,050
你將以背叛巫師同胞的罪名
You are therefore guilty of a treasonous betrayal

743
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:47,450
被處以死刑
of your fellow wizards and are sentenced to death.

744
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:49,740
戈德斯坦恩小姐作為煽動你的同黨
Miss Goldstein, who has aided and abetted you...

745
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:51,010
不  她什么都沒做
No, she's done nothing of the kind.

746
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:53,090
處以同等刑法
She receives the same sentence.

747
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:56,970
趕緊動手吧
Just do it immediately.

748
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:59,670
-我會親自通知皮奎里會長的  -蒂娜
- I will inform President Picquery myself. - Tina.

749
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:02,620
麻煩了
Please.

750
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:19,070
別這么做  貝娜黛特  求你了
Don't do this, Bernadette, please...

751
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:21,600
不會疼的
It don't hurt.

752
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:03,240
-蒂娜  -媽媽  -蒂娜
- Tina... - Momma... - Tina...

753
01:10:05,650 --> 01:10:09,880
來吧小南瓜  該睡覺啦  準備好了嗎
Come on, pumpkin, time for bed. Are you ready?

754
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:12,690
看上去是不是很美好
Don't that look good?

755
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,690
想進去吧
You wanna get in?

756
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:29,720
-山姆  -奎妮
- Hey, Sam! - Hey, Queenie.

757
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:31,090
他們叫你去樓下
They need you downstairs.

758
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:33,480
-我來施遺忘咒  -你無權執行
- I'll obliviate this guy. - You ain't qualified.

759
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:36,510
山姆
Hey, Sam.

760
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:39,170
西西里知道你在和露比幽會嗎
Does Cecily know you been seeing Ruby?

761
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:43,060
-你是怎么  -只要讓我施咒
- How'd you... - Let me obliviate this guy

762
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:44,730
我保證一個字也不會往外說
and she'll never hear about it from me.

763
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,020
你干什么
What are you doing?

764
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:52,800
蒂妮有麻煩了  我正在四處傾聽
Teen's in trouble, I'm trying to listen...

765
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,480
雅各布  紐特的手提箱在哪里
Jacob, where's Newt's case?

766
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,440
應該是那個格雷夫斯拿走了
I think that guy Graves took it.

767
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:58,520
好吧  跟我來
Okay, come on.

768
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:00,320
你不打算抹掉我的記憶嗎
What? You're not gonna obliviate me?

769
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:04,110
當然不會了  你跟我們是一伙兒的
Of course not, you're one of us now!

770
01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:33,390
沒事了
It's okay.

771
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:45,000
阿拉霍洞開
Alohomora.

772
01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:49,310
芝麻開門
Aberto...

773
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:52,640
他應該是用更高級的咒語鎖了門
He would know a fancy spell to lock his office.

774
01:11:55,790 --> 01:11:58,740
好了  現在來看看你的美好回憶吧
Okay, let's get the good stuff out of you.

775
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,490
女巫
Witch!

776
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:33,830
-它會吃掉我的  -別慌
- It's just gonna eat me! - Don't panic!

777
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:35,780
我不慌還能怎么辦
What do you suggest I do instead?

778
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:42,660
跳過來
Jump.

779
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:48,060
-瘋了嗎你  -跳到它背上
- Are you crazy? - Jump on him.

780
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:54,230
蒂娜  聽我說  我會接住你的
Tina, listen to me. I'll catch you.

781
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:56,990
蒂娜
Tina!

782
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:04,090
我會接住你的
I'll catch you.

783
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:08,570
有我在  蒂娜  跳
I've got you, Tina. Go!

784
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:15,380
快走
Come on!

785
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:24,750
馬上就來 
Coming through!

786
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:27,510
讓開
Move!

787
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,130
別吃他的腦子  快走吧
Leave his brains, come on!

788
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:37,650
快
Come on!

789
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,120
-那是什么  -蜷翼魔
- What is that thing? - Swooping Evil.

790
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:44,600
我愛死它了
Well, I love it!

791
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:00,860
進去吧
Get in.

792
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:12,690
奎妮
Queenie!

793
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:19,260
你這是要去哪
Where you going?

794
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:23,660
我生病了  阿伯內西先生
I'm sick, Mr. Abernathy.

795
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:27,000
又病了啊
Again?

796
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:30,490
你手里提的是什么
Well, what've you got there?

797
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:32,780
女士用品
Ladies things.

798
01:14:33,650 --> 01:14:35,620
你要看一下嗎  我不介意的
You wanna take a look? I don't mind.

799
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:38,040
噢老天  不用了  我
Good gravy, no! I...

800
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:44,030
-希望你早日康復  -謝謝你
- You get well now! - Thanks.

801
01:14:58,230 --> 01:14:59,760
克雷登斯  你找到那個孩子了嗎
Credence. Have you found the child?

802
01:15:02,150 --> 01:15:03,330
我做不到
I can't.

803
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:05,410
我看看
Show me.

804
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,370
我的孩子  我們越早找到這個孩子
My boy, the sooner we find this child,

805
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:21,360
你便能越快地脫離痛苦
the sooner you can put that pain in the past where it belongs.

806
01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:25,950
我想把這個送給你  克雷登斯
I want you to have this, Credence.

807
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:30,070
能讓我放心托付它的人不多
I would trust very few with it.

808
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:33,550
很少
Very few.

809
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,280
可是你
But you...

810
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:41,730
你跟別人不一樣
You're different.

811
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:44,780
只要找到了那個孩子
When you find the child,

812
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:47,370
碰一下這個標識我便知道  我會來找你
touch this symbol and I will know, and I will come to you.

813
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:55,160
事成之后   你將在巫師界
Do this and you will be honored among wizards.

814
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:57,260
名垂千古
Forever.

815
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:02,260
這孩子快不行了了  克雷登斯
The child is dying, Credence.

816
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,190
時間緊迫
Time is running out.

817
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:24,220
你祖父養鴿子啊  我祖父養貓頭鷹
Your grandfather kept pigeons? Mine bred owls.

818
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:27,590
我以前很喜歡給他們喂食來著
I used to love feeding them.

819
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,540
格雷夫斯一直說最近的混亂是動物引起的
Graves always insisted the disturbances were caused by a beast.

820
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:33,040
我們得盡早把你的動物找回來
We need to catch all your creatures

821
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:35,230
這樣他就不能拿它們當擋箭牌了
so he can't keep using them as a scapegoat.

822
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:36,920
還剩一只沒找到
There's only one still missing.

823
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:38,840
杜戈爾  我的隱形獸
Dougal, my Demiguise.

824
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:40,550
你還給它起了名字
Dougal?

825
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,930
稍微有點棘手的是
Slight problem is that...

826
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:44,950
它是隱形的
He's invisible.

827
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:51,720
-隱形的  -對  大部分時間里
- Invisible? - Yes, most of the time... He does...

828
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:57,340
-會隱形的東西還怎么抓  -難上加難
- How do you catch something that...? - With immense difficulty.

829
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:10,070
-納爾拉克  -你說什么
- Gnarlak! - Excuse me?

830
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:13,750
納爾拉克  我還是傲羅時他是我的線人
Gnarlak, he was an informant of mine when I was an Auror!

831
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:17,590
他曾暗地里進行魔法生物的買賣
He used to trade in magical creatures on the side.

832
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,240
他不會恰好對追蹤腳印感興趣吧
He wouldn't happen to have an interest in paw prints, would he?

833
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:26,000
一切能賣的東西他都感興趣
He's interested in anything he can sell.

834
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:04,970
*當巨龍擄走他心愛的女孩*
*When the dragon snapped up his best girl*

835
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:04,970

*比利威格蟲也忘記回旋*
*And the Billywig forgot to twirl*

*愛人離開  留他獨自寒心徹骨*
*When his sweetheart left him cold*

839
01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:19,030
*獨角獸也斷了長角*
*And the unicorn done lost his horn*

840
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:23,050
這酒吧要怎么點單啊
How do I get a drink in this joint?

841
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:27,210
干嘛  沒見過家養小精靈嗎
What? Ain't you ever seen a house-elf before?

842
01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:31,710
不  當然不是  我愛死家養小精靈了
No, no, of course I have. I love house-elves.

843
01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:31,710
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}家養小精靈為巫師家庭中地位最卑賤的物種
因此被巫師所厭惡

844
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:33,780
我的叔叔就是個家養小精靈
My uncle's a house-elf.

845
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:36,530
我看也是
Yeah...

846
01:18:39,570 --> 01:18:42,740
六小杯咯咯酒和一杯大腦沖擊波  謝謝
Six shots of gigglewater and a lobe blaster, please.

847
01:18:39,570 --> 01:18:42,740
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}1731年起風靡美國巫師界的一種雞尾酒

所有的麻雞都像你一樣嗎
Are all No-Majs like you?

849
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:55,570
不 只有我像我一樣
No, I'm the only one like me.

這里一半的人都被我抓過
I've arrested half of the people in here.

852
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:19,000
你可以說我多管閑事  但是
You can tell me to mind my own business, but...

853
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,480
但在死亡池里我看到了一些東西
I saw something in that death potion back there.

854
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:27,160
我看到你抱住了那個第二塞勒姆的男孩
I saw you hugging that Second Salem boy.

855
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:29,170
他叫克雷登斯
His name's Credence.

856
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:32,350
他媽媽虐待他
His mother beats him.

857
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:36,810
她鞭打她收養的所有小孩
She beats all those kids she adopted,

858
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:38,730
但似乎對他下手最重
but she seems to hit him the most.

859
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:42,870
她就是你攻擊的那個麻雞嗎
And she was the No-Maj you attacked?

860
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,270
我就是這樣失業的
That's how I lost my job.

861
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:50,660
我動手時正是她和信徒的集會
I went for her in front of a meeting of her crazy followers.

862
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:53,250
在場的人都必須被抹去記憶
They all had to be obliviated.

863
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:54,520
當時惹了很大的亂子
It was a big scandal.

864
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:55,990
他來了
It's him.

865
01:20:04,430 --> 01:20:05,390
所以...
So...

866
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,310
你就是那個提了一箱子神奇動物的人吧
You're the guy with the case full of monsters, huh?

867
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,270
消息傳得挺快嘛
News travels fast.

868
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:16,310
我希望您能告訴我
I was hoping you'd be able

869
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:18,840
有沒有什么奇異的事發生
to tell me if there have been any sightings.

870
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:21,750
或者蹤跡之類
Tracks. That sort of thing.

871
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:26,590
你的腦袋值不少錢呢  斯卡曼德先生
You've got a big price on your head, Mr. Scamander.

872
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:32,120
我為什么要幫你  不如把你交上去
Why should I help you instead of turning you in?

873
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:34,490
看來您的消息不免費啊
I take it I'll have to make it worth your while?

874
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,730
你就當是封口費吧
Let's consider it a cover charge.

875
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:46,140
魔法國會的懸賞可比這多多了
MACUSA's offering more than that.

876
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:50,990
望月鏡
Lunascope?

877
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:55,240
我有五個
I got five.

878
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:04,370
冰凍的火灰蛇蛋
Frozen Ashwinder egg.

879
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:05,990

You see, now we're...

01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:08,720

Wait a minute.

那是護...  那是護樹羅鍋吧
That's Bow... That's a Bowtruckle, right?

01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:17,400
不行
No.

883
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,540
得了吧  它們能開鎖對吧
Come on. They pick locks, am I right?

884
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:21,330
我不賣
You're not having him.

885
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:28,410
希望你能從魔法國會的
Good luck getting back alive, Mr. Scamander,

886
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,800
漫天抓捕中逃生  斯卡曼德先生
what with the whole of MACUSA on your back.

887
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:33,950

All right.

888
01:21:43,390 --> 01:21:44,300
皮克特...

有個隱形的家伙在第五大道搞破壞
Something invisible's been wreaking havoc around Fifth Avenue.

890
01:22:00,690 --> 01:22:03,420
你們可以去梅西百貨商場看看
You may wanna check out Macy's department store.

891
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:04,970
也許是你們要找的東西
Might help with what you're looking for.

892
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:05,880
杜戈爾

893
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:07,260
最后一件事

01:22:08,540 --> 01:22:11,160
魔法國會里有位格雷夫斯先生
There's a Mr. Graves who works at MACUSA.

895
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:14,050
不知道你了不了解他的背景
I was wondering what you knew of his background.

896
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:16,000
你問題可真多
You ask a lot of questions,

897
01:22:16,790 --> 01:22:17,840
斯卡曼德先生
Mr. Scamander.

好奇害死貓
That can get you killed.

899
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:26,370
魔法國會的人來了
MACUSA are coming!

903
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,570
看到他就讓我想起我的工頭
Reminds me of my foreman!

你在做什么  克雷登斯
What are you doin? Credence?

905
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:24,760
你在哪找到的這個
Where'd you get this?

906
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:27,750

What is this?

908
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:39,550
把它給我

-媽  -我不是你媽
- Ma... - I am not your Ma!

910
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:14,940
你媽是個邪惡的  不正常的女人
Your mother was a wicked, unnatural woman!

-那是我的  -莫德絲蒂

怎么回事
What is this?

913
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:29,610
盡管隱形獸平時性情溫和
So Demiguises are fundamentally peaceful,

914
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:32,870
但被惹怒了也是會咬人的
but they can give a nasty nip if provoked.

915
01:25:34,770 --> 01:25:37,300
你們倆  去那邊
You two, head that way.

916
01:25:37,910 --> 01:25:40,020
盡力隱藏自己的目的
And try very hard not to be predictable.

917
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,940
那是隱形獸嗎
Was that the Demiguise?

918
01:25:47,290 --> 01:25:51,020
不  但我覺得那是隱形獸來這兒的目的
No, I think it might be the reason that the Demiguise is here.

919
01:26:06,010 --> 01:26:08,260
它的視線能自動分析可能性
Its sight operates on probability,

920
01:26:08,470 --> 01:26:11,660
所以它能預測到很近的未來
so it can foresee the most likely immediate future.

921
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:17,730
-那它是做什么的  -照顧孩子
- So what's it doing? - It's babysitting.

-你說什么  -這是我的錯
- What did you just say? - This is my fault.

01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:24,830
我以為全找回來了
I thought I had them all,

924
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:27,860
可我數漏了一個
but I must have miscounted.

它是在照顧那玩意兒
It was babysitting that?

鳥蛇可以隨意改變體型
Occamies are choranaptyxic.

01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:53,220
可以變大到塞滿所在的整個空間
So they grow to fill available space.

媽媽來了
Mummy's here.

我們需要只昆蟲
We need an insect,

什么蟲子都行  還要一個茶壺
any kind of insect and a teapot!

01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:28,070
快找個茶壺來
Find a teapot!

01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:14,020
它們也可以縮身來適應空間
They also shrink to fit the available space.

937
01:29:19,910 --> 01:29:20,970
告訴我真相
Tell me the truth.

938
01:29:23,070 --> 01:29:23,760
現在逃掉的
Was that everything that

939
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:26,870
-真的都找到了嗎  -都找到了
- came out of the case? - That's everything.

940
01:29:28,810 --> 01:29:29,940
這句是真話
And that's the truth.

941
01:29:34,150 --> 01:29:37,620
-她來了  -回家高興嗎
- Here she comes. - Happy to be home?

942
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:39,950
我打賭你一定累了  伙計
Bet you're exhausted, buddy.

01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:43,880
來吧  就在這兒
Come on. There you go, that's right.

944
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:13,050
沒錯  我們是得談談
Right. I think we need to talk.

945
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:19,800
我不會讓真讓他帶走你的  皮克特
I wouldn't have let him keep you, Pickett.

946
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:22,930
皮克  我寧愿失去手也不會拋棄你的
Pick, I would rather chop off my hand than get rid of you.

947
01:30:22,930 --> 01:30:25,120
你為了付出了那么多  相信我吧
After everything you have done for me, now come on.

948
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:29,770
皮克  不是說好不生悶氣的嗎
Pick, we've talked about sulking before, haven't we?

949
01:30:30,630 --> 01:30:31,550
皮克特
Pickett...

950
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:35,260
求你了  給我個微笑
Come on, give me a smile.

951
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:36,890
皮克特  給我
Pickett, give me a...

952
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:42,200
好吧  你平時絕對沒這么小氣
All right. Now, that is beneath you.

953
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:51,260
紐特
Newt.

954
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:56,830
-她是誰  -誰也不是
- Who is she? - That's no one.

955
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:00,510
麗塔·萊斯特蘭奇
Leta Lestrange?

956
01:31:02,170 --> 01:31:03,620
我聽說過他們一家
I've heard of that family.

957
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,640
他們不都有點...你懂的
Aren't they kinda, you know?

958
01:31:07,730 --> 01:31:09,080
請別讀我的心
Please don't read my mind.

959
01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:22,830
對不起  我說過別讀了
Sorry, I asked you not to.

960
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:25,020
我知道  抱歉
I know, I'm sorry.

961
01:31:26,590 --> 01:31:27,650
我就是控制不住
I can't help it.

962
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:30,190
每當人們傷心時
People are easiest to

963
01:31:30,190 --> 01:31:32,520
-最容易被讀心  -我不傷心
- read when they're hurting. - I'm not hurting.

964
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:35,750
總之  事情已經過去很久了
Anyway, it was a long time ago.

965
01:31:45,140 --> 01:31:47,490
你們在學校的友誼真的很親密
That was a real close friendship you had at school.

966
01:31:50,530 --> 01:31:52,330
我們倆都不怎么適合學校生活
Neither of us really fitted in at school.

967
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:56,320
-所以我倆就變成了  -變成了摯友

那么多年
For years.

969
01:32:04,470 --> 01:32:09,330
她只會索取  你需要也能為你付出的人

970
01:32:10,410 --> 01:32:14,060
-你們在聊些什么  -沒什么
- What are you two talking about? - Nothing.

971
01:32:14,790 --> 01:32:16,760
-學校的事  -對  學校
- School. - School.

972
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:21,930
你們剛才說學校  這兒還有學校嗎
Did you say school? Is there a school?

973
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:25,570
巫師學校  就在美國
A wizardry school here? In America?

974
01:32:25,570 --> 01:32:27,870
那當然  伊法魔尼
Of course, Ilvermorny!

975

它可是全球最棒的魔法學校
It's only the best wizard school in the whole world!

976
01:32:30,620 --> 01:32:31,610
我想你會發現  世界上
I think you'll find the best

977
01:32:31,610 --> 01:32:34,100
最好的魔法學校是霍格沃茨
wizarding school in the world is Hogwarts!

978
01:32:35,230 --> 01:32:36,720
廢話多
Hogwash!

979
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:47,870
危險
Danger.

980
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:52,380
他能感覺到危險
He senses danger.

981
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:35,020
默然者來了
The Obscurial was here?

982
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:37,070
她去哪了
Where did she go?

983
01:33:39,390 --> 01:33:43,050
救救我  救救我
Help me. Help me.

984
01:33:45,980 --> 01:33:48,220
你不是說你還有個妹妹嗎
Didn't you tell me you had another sister?

985
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:51,710
求你救救我

986
01:33:52,510 --> 01:33:53,270
你妹妹在哪
Where's your other sister,

987
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:54,560
-克雷登斯 -求你救救我

你妹妹現在很危險

990

我們得找到她

991
01:34:16,070 --> 01:34:19,650
-這是哪  -媽媽在這里收養了她

992

她家里當時有十二個人
From a family of twelve.

993

她很想念他的兄弟姐妹

時常提起他們

995
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:29,290
她現在在哪
Where is she?

996
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:32,760
我不知道
I don't know.

997
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:36,270
你是個聰明人  克雷登斯
You're a Squib, Credence.

998
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:39,810
從我第一次遇見你  我就知道
I could smell it off you the minute I met you.

999
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:41,880
什么
What?

1000
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:45,710
你有魔法血統  可你無法施展
You have magical ancestry, but no power.

1001
01:34:47,090 --> 01:34:48,620
你說過你會教我
But you said you could teach me.

1002
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:49,860
這只能你自己琢磨
You're unteachable.

1003
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:53,500
你母親的死  就是對你的獎賞
Your mother's dead. That's your reward.

1004
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:56,190
我受夠你了
I'm done with you.

1005
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:06,300
莫德絲蒂
Modesty?

1006
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:19,610
莫德絲蒂
Modesty.

1007
01:35:21,310 --> 01:35:25,180
不必害怕

1008

1010
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:15,690
克雷登斯  我得向你道歉
Credence, I owe you an apology.

1011
01:36:16,830 --> 01:36:18,180
我信任了你
I trusted you.

1012
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:25,450
我以為你是我朋友  以為你不一樣
I thought you were my friend. That you were different.

1013
01:36:27,950 --> 01:36:31,490
你能控制住它  克雷登斯
You can control it, Credence.

1014
01:36:36,990 --> 01:36:39,090
可是我并不想  格雷夫斯先生
But I don't think I want to, Mr. Graves.

1015
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:07,170
天哪  是那個什么默然者嗎
Jeez. Is that the Obscuriathing?

1016
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:11,760
它比我聽說過的所有默然者都強悍
That's more powerful than any Obscurial I have ever heard of.

1017
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:19,440
如果我沒能回來  幫我照顧好它們
If I don't come back, look after my creatures.

1018
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:23,680
所有需要知道的都記錄在這了
Everything that you need to know is in there.

1019
01:37:24,610 --> 01:37:25,530
什么
What?

1020
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:27,250
他們殺不了他
They're not killing it.

1021
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:34,120
紐特  你聽到了  照顧好它們
Newt! You heard him, look after them!

1022
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:39,120
-親愛的  拿好了  -不不不
- Keep holda that, honey. - No, no, no!

1023
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:45,510
我不能帶上你  讓我走吧  雅各布
I can't take you. Please let go of me, Jacob!

1024
01:37:47,190 --> 01:37:49,160
你說過我們是一伙兒的
You're the one that said I was one of youse,

1025
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:52,120
-對吧  -這太危險了
- right? - It's too dangerous.

1026
01:38:22,850 --> 01:38:27,850
被它寄生你居然幸存到現在  克雷登斯
To survive so long, with this inside you, Credence,

1027
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:33,830
這就是奇跡  你就是個奇跡
is a miracle. You are a miracle.

1028
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:39,270
跟我走吧  想想我們倆聯手能做多少
Come with me, think of what we could achieve together.

1029
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:55,110
紐特
Newt!

1030
01:38:55,170 --> 01:38:56,370
是第二塞勒姆的那個男孩
It's the Second Salem boy.

1031
01:38:56,370 --> 01:38:57,770
他才是默然者
He's the Obscurial.

1032
01:38:58,020 --> 01:38:59,160
但他不是孩子了
He's not a child.

1033
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:01,380
肯定是他的魔力太強大
His power must be so strong,

1034
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:03,810
不知怎么幸存了下來
he's somehow managed to survive.

1035
01:39:08,190 --> 01:39:11,480
紐特  一定要救下他
Newt! Save him.

1036
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:20,300
格雷夫斯先生
Mr. Graves.

1037
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:35,700
蒂娜  你總是出現在最不該出現的地方
Tina. You're always turning up where you are least wanted.

1038
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:51,420
控制住他  否則我們一旦暴露
Contain this, or we are exposed

1039
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:52,890
便會爆發戰爭
and it will mean war.

1040
01:40:03,610 --> 01:40:04,610
克雷登斯 
Credence!

1041
01:40:05,770 --> 01:40:07,140
克雷登斯  我能幫你

1043
01:41:47,970 --> 01:41:49,450
不允許任何人進來
I don't want anyone else down there!

1044
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,250
克雷登斯
Credence...

1045
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:07,870
你叫克雷登斯  對吧
It's Credence, isn't it?

1046
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:13,520
我是來幫助你的  克雷登斯
I'm here to help you, Credence.

1047
01:42:14,730 --> 01:42:16,290
我不是來傷害你的
I'm not here to hurt you.

1048
01:42:36,530 --> 01:42:38,290
我見過和你一樣的人
I've met someone just like you,

1049
01:42:38,290 --> 01:42:39,150
克雷登斯
Credence.

1050
01:42:42,530 --> 01:42:43,450
一個女孩
A girl.

1051
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:47,920
一個被囚禁的小女孩
A young girl who'd been imprisoned,

1052
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:51,470
她因為有魔法
she had been locked away

1053
01:42:51,470 --> 01:42:53,960
被關了起來  還受到折磨
and she'd been punished for her magic.

1054
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:13,150
克雷登斯
Credence...

1055
01:43:16,630 --> 01:43:17,950
我能過你那兒去嗎
Can I come over to you?

1056
01:43:21,810 --> 01:43:22,870
我能過去嗎
Can I come over?

1057
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:56,600
那東西殺了我兒子  我要討個公道
That thing killed my son. I want justice!

1058
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:01,420
我要揭露你的真面目以及你的所作所為
I'll expose you for who you are and what you've done.

1059
01:44:25,170 --> 01:44:26,910
快看  拍  拍照
Look! Take... Take photos.

1060
01:44:54,820 --> 01:44:56,000
克雷登斯
Credence.

1061
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:36,590
克雷登斯  不要
Credence, no!

1062
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:45,810
別這樣做  求你了
Don't do this. Please.

1063
01:45:47,420 --> 01:45:48,910
接著說  蒂娜
Keep talking, Tina.

1064
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:54,460
繼續說話  他會聽你的  他在聽
Keep talking to him, he'll listen to you. He's listening.

1065

我知道那個女人對你做了些什么

我知道你備受煎熬

1067

你不能再這樣下去了
You need to stop this now.

1068
01:46:13,010 --> 01:46:15,180
我和紐特會保護你的
Newt and I will protect you.

1069
01:46:17,980 --> 01:46:22,030
這個男人  他在利用你
This man... He is using you.

1070
01:46:22,030 --> 01:46:23,640
別聽她的  克雷登斯
Don't listen to her, Credence.

1071
01:46:24,490 --> 01:46:26,200
我是想給你自由

Anyone harms him, they'll answer to me. Credence!

1075
01:46:47,890 --> 01:46:49,210
克雷登斯
Credence...

1076

-不  -不
- No. - No!

1077
01:47:28,140 --> 01:47:31,800
克雷登斯  你們這些傻子
Credence... You fools.

1078
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:35,840
知道你們做了什么嗎
Do you realize what you've done?

1079
01:47:36,210 --> 01:47:38,920
殺死默然者是我的命令
The Obscurial was killed on my orders,

1080
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:40,780
-格雷夫斯先生  -是啊
- Mr. Graves. - Yes.

1081
01:47:41,540 --> 01:47:44,650
這一點歷史不會忘記的  會長女士
And history will surely note that, Madam President.

1082
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:47,460
今晚在這里發生的事不公道
What was done here tonight was not right!

1083
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:50,120
是他殺死了那個麻雞
He was responsible for the death of a No-Maj.

1084
01:47:50,330 --> 01:47:52,390
他帶來了暴露我們的危險
He risked the exposure of our community.

1085
01:47:52,390 --> 01:47:54,260
他違反了我們最神圣的法律
He has broken one of our most sacred laws.

1086
01:47:54,260 --> 01:47:58,000
讓我們像水溝里的老鼠般躲藏的法律
A law that has us scuttling like rats in the gutter!

1087
01:47:58,070 --> 01:48:00,680
迫使我們壓抑本性的法律
A law that demands that we conceal our true nature!

1088
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:03,970
讓我們活在恐懼的陰影下的法律
A law that directs those under its dominion to cower in fear

1089
01:48:03,970 --> 01:48:05,820
唯恐我們被發現
lest we risk discovery!

1090
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:10,390
我問你  會長女士
I ask you, Madam President.

1091
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:13,450
我問你們所有人
I ask all of you...

1092
01:48:15,690 --> 01:48:17,450
這法律保護的是誰
Who does this law protect?

1093
01:48:19,870 --> 01:48:21,050
我們
Us?

1094
01:48:23,290 --> 01:48:24,650
還是他們
Or them?

1095
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:33,950
我拒絕繼續遵守這項法律
I refuse to bow down any longer.

1096
01:48:33,980 --> 01:48:35,220
傲羅們
Aurors,

1097
01:48:35,890 --> 01:48:38,360
收回格雷夫斯先生的魔杖
I'd like you to relieve Mr. Graves of his wand

1098
01:48:38,530 --> 01:48:40,320
并把他押解回來
and escort him back to...

1099
01:49:13,690 --> 01:49:14,850
速速飛來
Accio.

1100
01:49:24,700 --> 01:49:25,960
原形顯現
Revelio.

1101
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:53,170
你覺得你能困住我嗎
Do you think you can hold me?

1102
01:49:55,300 --> 01:49:56,780
我們會盡全力的
We'll do our best,

1103
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:58,710
格林德沃先生
Mr. Grindelwald.

1104
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:18,730
后會有期
Will we die, just a little?

1105
01:50:32,860 --> 01:50:35,840
我看這東西還需要某人照看
I figured somebody oughta keep an eye on this thing.

1106
01:50:40,940 --> 01:50:42,000
謝謝你
Thank you.

1107
01:50:42,010 --> 01:50:44,080
我們深表歉意  斯卡曼德先生
We owe you an apology, Mr. Scamander.

1108
01:50:45,300 --> 01:50:47,760
但是魔法社區被曝光了
But the magical community is exposed!

1109
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:51,320
我們不能抹掉整個城市的記憶
We cannot obliviate an entire city.

1110
01:50:56,600 --> 01:51:00,650
其實  我覺得可以
Actually, I think we can.

1111
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:29,640
我還打算帶你一起去亞利桑那州呢
I was intending to wait until we got to Arizona,

1112
01:51:32,910 --> 01:51:34,070
但現在看來
but it seems like now

1113
01:51:34,070 --> 01:51:35,480
你是我們唯一的希望了  弗蘭克
you are our only hope, Frank.

1114
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,290
我也會想你的
I'll miss you too.

1115
01:52:08,940 --> 01:52:10,360
你知道該怎么辦
You know what you've got to do.

1116
01:54:38,310 --> 01:54:39,800
他們會忘記所有的事情
They won't remember anything.

1117
01:54:41,010 --> 01:54:44,090
那個毒液有很強的失憶功能
That venom has incredibly powerful obliviative properties.

1118
01:54:46,860 --> 01:54:48,960
我們欠你一個大人情  斯卡曼德先生
We owe you a great debt, Mr. Scamander.

1119
01:54:52,220 --> 01:54:55,710
現在  趕緊把你的箱子弄出紐約
Now, get that case out of New York.

1120
01:54:56,340 --> 01:54:57,750
遵命  會長女士
Yes, Madam President.

1121
01:55:04,270 --> 01:55:06,370
那個麻雞還在這嗎
Is that No-Maj still here?

1122
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:14,620
一忘皆空  不能有特例
Obliviate him. There can be no exceptions.

1123
01:55:16,140 --> 01:55:19,020
對不起  就算只有一個人知道
I'm sorry, but even one witness.

1124
01:55:19,140 --> 01:55:20,480
你知道法律的
You know the law.

1125
01:55:24,530 --> 01:55:25,980
你們自己告別吧
I'll let you say good-bye.

1126
01:55:41,550 --> 01:55:42,950
這是最好的結局
This is for the best.

1127
01:55:43,740 --> 01:55:45,770
沒錯  我本來  
Yeah, I was,

1128
01:55:46,820 --> 01:55:49,020
本來就不該在這
I was never even supposed to be here.

1129
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:54,840
我本不該知道任何事情
I was never supposed to know any of this.

1130
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:01,400
大家都知道紐特把我留在他身邊
Everybody knows Newt only kept me around

1131
01:56:01,400 --> 01:56:02,750
只是因為
because...

1132
01:56:05,330 --> 01:56:08,050
紐特  話說你為什么把我留在身邊
Newt, why did you keep me around?

1133
01:56:09,610 --> 01:56:10,850
因為我喜歡你
Because I like you.

1134
01:56:13,530 --> 01:56:15,550
你是我的朋友
Because you're my friend

1135
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:17,950
我永遠都不會忘記
and I'll never forget

1136
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:19,530
你是如何幫助我的  雅各布
how you helped me, Jacob.

1137
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:25,280
我會跟著你的
I'll come with you.

1138
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:29,100
我們去別的地方  我們浪跡天涯
We'll go somewhere, we'll go anywhere.

1139
01:56:30,580 --> 01:56:34,520
我再也找不到像你一樣的人了
See, I ain't never gonna find anyone like you.

1140
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:39,050
很多人都像我一樣
There's loads like me.

1141
01:56:39,200 --> 01:56:41,710
不  不
No. No.

1142
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:44,840
只有你像你一樣
There's only one like you.

1143
01:56:51,130 --> 01:56:52,430
我得走了
I gotta go.

1144
01:56:57,500 --> 01:57:01,070
-雅各布  -沒事  沒事的
- Jacob! - It's okay. It's okay.

1145
01:57:04,010 --> 01:57:05,180
沒事
It's okay.

1146
01:57:10,090 --> 01:57:11,740
就像從夢中醒來一樣  對吧
It's just like waking up, right?

1147
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:16,780
很抱歉  對不起
So sorry, sorry!

1148
01:59:34,230 --> 01:59:35,770
親愛的科瓦斯基先生 
Dear Mr. Kowalski,

1149
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:38,270
您在罐頭廠實在是大材小用
you are wasted in a canning factory.

1150
01:59:41,450 --> 01:59:43,210
請把這些鳥蛇的蛋殼
Please take these Occamy eggshells

1151
01:59:43,220 --> 01:59:44,650
作為點心屋的擔保
as collateral for your bakery.

1152
01:59:45,110 --> 01:59:46,380
一位好心人
A well-wisher.

1153
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:12,560
-這幾天  -我也覺得
- It's been... - Hasn't it?

1154
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:21,120
聽著  紐特  我要感謝你
Listen, Newt, I wanted to thank you.

1155
02:00:21,780 --> 02:00:23,100
為什么感謝我
What on earth for?

1156
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:26,900
你知道的  要不是你
Well, you know, if you hadn't said

1157
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:28,990
替我跟皮奎里女士說好話
all those nice things to Madam Picquery about me,

1158
02:00:28,990 --> 02:00:31,320
我現在也不可能重新成為傲羅
I wouldn't be back on the investigative team now.

1159
02:00:32,910 --> 02:00:33,750
非要被調查的話
Well, I can't think of

1160
02:00:33,750 --> 02:00:36,010
被任何人都不如被你調查好
anyone that I'd rather have investigating me.

1161
02:00:39,150 --> 02:00:42,750
-最好還是盡量別被調查吧  -我會的
- Try not to need investigating for a bit. - I will.

1162
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:44,780
從今以后我想過安定的生活
Quiet life for me from now on.

1163
02:00:45,530 --> 02:00:47,240
回去之后
Back to the Ministry.

1164
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:50,210
-我會發表我的作品  -我很期待
- Deliver my manuscript. - I'll look out for it.

1165
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:53,230
《神奇動物在哪里》
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.

1166
02:00:59,570 --> 02:01:01,820
麗塔·萊斯特蘭奇喜歡讀書嗎
Does Leta Lestrange like to read?

1167
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:08,130
-誰  -你隨身攜帶的照片里的姑娘
- Who? - The girl whose picture you carry.

1168
02:01:10,710 --> 02:01:11,710
人是會變的
I don't really know

1169
02:01:11,710 --> 02:01:16,650
現在麗塔喜歡什么我也不知道
what Leta likes these days, because people change.

1170
02:01:17,550 --> 02:01:19,160
-沒錯  -我反正是變了
- Yes. - I've changed.

1171
02:01:21,130 --> 02:01:24,570
我想  或許一點點吧
I think. Maybe a little.

1172
02:01:34,830 --> 02:01:37,050
可以的話  能允許我送你一本新書嗎
I'll send you a copy of my book, if I may.

1173
02:01:38,020 --> 02:01:39,320
那太好了
I'd like that.

1174
02:01:58,220 --> 02:01:59,200
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

1175
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:02,470
如果是我親自送來給你呢
How would you feel if I gave you your copy in person?

1176
02:02:05,430 --> 02:02:06,760
那樣更好
I'd like that.

1177
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:11,360
我非常期待
Very much.

1178
02:03:29,050 --> 02:03:30,670
你的創意來自哪里啊
Where do you get your ideas from,

1179
02:03:30,670 --> 02:03:32,650
-科瓦斯基先生  -我也不知道
- Mr. Kowalski? - I don't know.

1180
02:03:32,670 --> 02:03:36,220
我也不明白  突發奇想吧
I don't know. They just come.

1181
02:03:37,120 --> 02:03:40,380
給  別忘了這個  好好享用吧
Here you go. Don't forget this. Enjoy.

1182
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:43,920
喂  亨利  儲藏室鑰匙
Hey, Henry, storage, all right?

1183
02:03:44,310 --> 02:03:45,580
謝啦  伙計
Thanks, pal.
