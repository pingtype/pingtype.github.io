{\an8}紐約市  一八七零年代

25
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,714
哇
Well...

26
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,611
無法想像明戈特的家眷會穿這種衣服
I didn't think the Mingotts would have tried it on.

27
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,072
在劇院裏如此炫耀地
Parading her at the opera like that,

28
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,116
還讓她坐在梅·韋蘭德身旁
sitting her next to May Welland.

29
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,784
真奇怪
It's all very odd.

30
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,412
但她的經歷也挺奇怪
Well, she's had such an odd life.

31
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,039
他們會帶她參加博弗特家的舞會嗎
Will they even bring her to the Beauforts' ball, do you suppose?

32
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,042
如果那樣  一定會引起軒然大波
If they do, the talk will be of little else.

33
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,317
晚上好  韋蘭德太太  晚上好  梅
Good evening, Mrs. Welland. Good evening, May.

34
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:22,237
紐倫德  我的外甥女奧蘭斯卡伯爵夫人
Newland. You know my niece Countess Olenska.

35
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,292
伯爵夫人
Countess.

36
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,888
希望你已經告訴過奧蘭斯卡夫人了
I hope you've told Madame Olenska.

37
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,139
告訴她什麼
What?

38
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,557
我們訂婚的事
That we're engaged.

39
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:54,144
我要全世界都知道
I want everybody to know.

40
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,105
我要在舞會中宣佈
Let me announce it this evening at the ball.

41
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,941
如果你能說服我媽的話
If you can persuade Mamma.

42
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,444
已決定的事何必提前
Why should we change what is already settled?

43
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,155
不過你可以告訴我表姐
But you can tell my cousin yourself.

44
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,907
她記得你
She remembers you.

45
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,619
我記得我們曾在一起玩
I remember we played together.

46
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,121
這一切勾起了我的回憶
How this brings it all back to me.

47
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,500
我記得大家兒時的模樣
I remember everybody here the same way,

48
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,835
穿著可笑的燈籠褲和長褲
in knickerbockers and pantalettes.

49
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:36,603
你是個討厭鬼  還在門後強吻過我
You were horrid. You kissed me once behind a door.

50
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:40,315
我喜歡的是你堂哥范迪  但他從不願瞧我一眼
But it was your cousin Vandie, the one who never looked at me, I was in love with.

51
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,739
你已經離開很久了
Yes, you have been away a very long time.

52
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,074
太久了
Centuries and centuries.

53
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:52,994
久得令我感覺自己已死  而這裏宛如天堂
So long, I'm sure I'm dead and buried, and this dear old place is heaven.

54
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,626
昔日的事情
It invariably happened,

55
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:45,922
每次都是千篇一律地發生
as everything happened in those days, in the same way.

56
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,342
一如往常  博弗特夫人在沒有丈夫的陪伴下
As usual, Mrs. Julius Beaufort appeared,

57
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,428
獨自前來
unaccompanied by her husband,

58
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,055
觀賞  珠寶之歌
just before The Jewel Song.

59
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:59,978
又照例在第三幕之後起身離去
And again, as usual, rose at the end of the third act and disappeared.

60
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:03,565
全城都知道這表示半小時後
New York then knew that a half hour later,

61
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:07,319
一年一度的博弗特歌劇舞會便要開始
the Beauforts' Annual Opera Ball would begin.

62
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,838
馬車早已恭候多時
Carriages waited at the kerb for the entire performance.

63
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,425
紐約人彼此都心照不宣
It was widely known in New York, but never acknowledged,

64
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,011
美國人急於離開娛樂
that Americans want to get away from amusement,

65
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:36,181
比到達還急切
even more quickly than they want to get to it.

66
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,946
紐約人家很少像博弗特家一樣
The Beauforts' house was one of the few in New York

67
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,365
有個舞廳
that possessed a ballroom.

68
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:58,703
這樣的房間  一年塵封三百六十四天
Such a room, shuttered in darkness 364 days of the year,

69
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,163
好似在
was felt to compensate

70
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:04,167
追悼博弗特家的任何壞事
for whatever was regrettable in the Beaufort past.

71
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,879
博弗特夫人瑞吉娜來自南卡世家
Regina Beaufort came from an old South Carolina family,

72
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:11,800
但其夫尤利斯  被認為是個英國後裔
but her husband Julius, who passed for an Englishman,

73
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,219
終日花天酒地
was known to have dissipated habits,

74
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:17,472
言談尖酸刻薄  而且身世不詳
a bitter tongue and mysterious antecedents.

75
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,226
攀附世族為他帶來社會地位
His marriage assured him a social position,

76
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,436
但卻未贏得尊敬
but not necessarily respect.

77
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,727
紐倫德·阿切爾並未像時下的年輕人一般
Newland Archer had not stopped at his club,

78
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,770
在俱樂部盤桓
as young men usually did,

79
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,231
他直接來到博弗特家豪宅參加舞會
but came directly to the Beauforts.

80
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,650
藉機宣佈婚訊
He wanted the announcement of his engagement

81
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,445
轉移眾人對伯爵夫人的閒言閒語
to divert gossip away from the Countess,

82
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:18,033
並表示對梅及其親族的支持
and show his most ardent support for May and her whole family.

83
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:28,585
博弗特家的豪宅規劃別出心裁
The Beaufort house had been boldly planned.

84
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,254
賓客無須擠進長廊
Instead of squeezing through a narrow passage

85
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,424
可由寬敞的客廳
to get to the ballroom, one marched solemnly

86
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,469
直趨宴會廳
down a vista of enfiladed drawing rooms.

87
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,012
晚上好
Good evening.

88
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:56,738
但穿過絳紅色的客廳時
But only by actually passing through the Crimson Drawing Room

89
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:00,158
你會看到  春神再臨
could one see The Return of Spring,

90
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,744
布格瑞這幅充滿爭議的裸體畫
the much-discussed nude by Bouguereau,

91
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:07,916
只有博弗特家敢公開展示
which Beaufort had had the audacity to hang in plain sight.

92
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,504
- 晚上好  - 晚上好  阿切爾先生
- Good evening. - Good evening, Mr. Archer.

93
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,635
阿切爾欣賞這種挑戰傳統的作風
Archer enjoyed such challenges to convention.

94
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,346
雖然他私下質疑墨守成規
He questioned conformity in private,

95
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,849
但在人前他卻不遺餘力的支持傳統
but in public he upheld family and tradition.

96
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:28,269
這個世界危危地保持平衡
This was a world balanced so precariously

97
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,523
只要一聲低語即可將它粉碎
that its harmony could be shattered by a whisper.

98
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,213
總之  身旁這班假道學之人
On the whole, Archer was amused

99
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,133
總令他覺得好玩
by the smooth hypocrisies of his peers.

100
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,677
甚至令他羨慕
He may even have envied them.

101
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,360
例如勞倫斯·萊弗茨
Lawrence Lefferts, for instance,

102
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,400
全紐約最講究儀表的人
was New York's foremost authority on form.

103
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,936
他那套細分各種鞋的規矩
And his opinion on pumps versus patent-leather oxfords

104
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,021
被奉為圭臬
had never been disputed.

105
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,858
他四處獵艷
On matters of surreptitious romance,

106
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,736
手腕令人嘆服
his skills went unquestioned.

107
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:41,134
西勒頓·傑克遜先生熟知各家譜系
Old Mr. Sillerton Jackson was as great an authority on family

108
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,928
其權威性可比勞倫斯·萊弗茨之精研儀表
as Lawrence Lefferts was on form.

109
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:48,933
奧蘭斯卡伯爵夫人遠嫁歐洲的慘痛經驗
The mean and melancholy history of Countess Olenska's European marriage

110
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,729
他極欲一探究竟
was a buried treasure he hastened to excavate.

111
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,773
他就像個八卦活百科
He carried, like a calling card,

112
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,443
任何醜聞秘辛都一清二楚
an entire register of the scandals and mysteries

113
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,279
在表面太平的社交圈裏
that had smouldered under the unruffled surface

114
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:05,200
悶燒了五十年的陳年往事
of society for the last 50 years.

115
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:17,170
尤利斯·博弗特的成功秘訣  在於他的處世之道
Julius Beaufort's secret was the way he carried things off.

116
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,672
他可以若無其事地
He could arrive casually at his own party,

117
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,341
光臨自家舞會
as if he were another guest,

118
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:24,344
也可以大方地提早告辭
and might also leave early for a more modest,

119
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:27,889
溜進比較平民化的小公館
but comforting address in the East 30s.

120
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,391
他在事業上勇往直前
Beaufort was intrepid in his business,

121
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:34,187
在私生活上卻更加積極進取
but in his personal affairs absolutely audacious.

122
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:43,321
阿切爾的未婚妻對此  還有其他很多都一無所知
Archer's fiancee was innocent to all of these intrigues and of much else.

123
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:48,493
梅·韋蘭德代表上流社會最美的一切
May Welland represented for Archer all that was best in their world,

124
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:52,163
也是阿切爾所崇尚的  她使他不脫離這些規範
all that he honoured, and she anchored him to it.

125
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,171
我依你的意思告訴大家了
You see, I've told all my friends, just as you've asked.

126
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,675
我等不及了  我可真不願在舞會宣佈
Yes, I couldn't wait. Only I wish it hadn't had to be at a ball.

127
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,176
即使人多  這裏也只有我倆
But even here, we're alone together.

128
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:10,098
最糟的是我想吻你  但卻不能
The worst of it is that I want to kiss you, and I can't.

129
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,809
紐倫德
Newland.

130
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,029
你告訴艾倫了嗎
Did you tell Ellen as I asked you to?

131
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,700
我找不到機會說
No, I didn't have the chance after all.

132
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:32,370
她是我表姐  如果不先告訴她
She's my cousin, Newland. If others know before she does...

133
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,331
她離開久了  會很敏感的
It's just that she's been away for so long. She's rather sensitive.

134
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,334
我會說的  只是還沒見到她
Of course I'll tell her, dearest, but I didn't see her yet.

135
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,504
她臨時決定不來
She decided not to come at the last minute.

136
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,089
臨時決定
At the last minute?

137
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,050
她怕她的衣服不夠美
She was afraid her dress wasn't smart enough.

138
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,594
我們都說好看
We all thought it was so lovely,

139
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,013
但她執意回家
but she asked my aunt to take her home.

140
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,599
噢  原來如此
Oh, well.

141
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,494
很漂亮  很新潮
Very handsome. Very liberal.

142
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
想當年
In my time,

143
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:18,499
浮雕寶石鑲珠就算闊了
a cameo set in pearls was thought to be sufficient.

144
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:22,503
戴上的手才最能炫耀戒指
But it's the hand that sets off the ring, isn't it, my dear, Mr. Archer?

145
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,298
新式鑲法讓寶石更加耀眼奪目
It's the new setting. It shows the stone beautifully.

146
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,259
但老古板人會嫌樣式過於簡單
But it looks a little bare to old-fashioned eyes.

147
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,595
不是指我吧
I hope you don't mean mine, my dear.

148
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,931
我喜歡新東西
I like all the novelties.

149
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,309
我請巴黎名家做過手部雕塑
My hands were modelled in Paris by the great Roche.

150
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,852
他該幫梅做一個
He should do May's.

151
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,104
讓我瞧瞧  乖
Show me, child.

152
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,857
手都弄粗了
Her hand is so tempered.

153
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,100
那些時髦運動弄得關節粗大
It's these modern sports that spread the joints.

154
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,900
幸好皮膚依然白皙
But the skin is white.

155
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,238
婚禮何時舉行
And when's the wedding to be?

156
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,159
就快了  如果您肯支持我  明戈特夫人
As soon as ever it can, if only you'll back me up, Mrs. Mingott.

157
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,081
我們該讓小倆口好好認識彼此
We must give them time to get to know each other a little better, Mamma.

158
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,207
認識彼此
Know each other?

159
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,126
紐約世家子弟誰不認識誰
Everybody in New York has always known everybody.

160
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,462
有花堪折直須折
Don't wait till the bubble's off the wine.

161
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,214
四月完婚吧
Marry them before Lent.

162
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:10,218
說不定哪一天我會死於肺炎  而我要為他們辦喜宴
I may catch pneumonia any winter now, and I want to give the wedding breakfast.

163
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,886
你真疼孩子
What a kind offer.

164
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,555
就算曼森·明戈特夫人不是梅的奶奶
Even if she had not been grandmother to May,

165
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,558
小倆口訂婚後
Mrs. Manson Mingott would still have been the first

166
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,020
也一定會先拜見她
to receive the required betrothal visit.

167
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,815
她不僅是上流社會的大家長
She was not only the matriarch of this world,

168
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,567
簡直可以呼風喚雨
she was nearly its dowager empress.

169
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,945
紐約名流大多與她有親戚關係
Much of New York was already related to her,

170
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:33,157
其餘不是婚後家屬便是慕名之交
and she knew the remainder by marriage or by reputation.

171
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,326
當時建築慣用黃石砌牆
Though brownstone was the norm,

172
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,830
而她的豪宅外牆
she lived magisterially within a large house

173
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:43,042
卻大膽採用乳白色系石材
of controversial pale cream-coloured stone

174
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:47,588
座落於中央公園附近的密林中
in an inaccessible wilderness near the Central Park.

175
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,925
她老早就胖得
The burden of her flesh had long since made it impossible

176
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,428
爬不動樓梯
for her to go up and down stairs.

177
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,930
因此她又如常地大膽
So with characteristic independence,

178
00:16:56,015 --> 00:17:00,476
搬到樓下生活
she had established herself on the ground floor of her house.

179
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:05,606
從會客室可以窺見她的臥房
From her sitting room, there was an unexpected vista of her bedroom.

180
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,192
那異國情調
Her visitors were startled and fascinated,

181
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,319
總令訪客驚嘆不已
by the foreignness of this arrangement,

182
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:14,490
總令人聯想起法國小說中
which recalled scenes in French fiction.

183
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:19,162
養著情夫的貴婦
This was how women with lovers lived in the wicked old societies.

184
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,748
其實她若願意
But if Mrs. Mingott had wanted a lover,

185
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:25,626
她大可養一個
the intrepid woman would have had him, too.

186
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,505
但她很滿足於現狀
For now she was content simply for life and passion

187
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,300
就讓別人把生活要聞報告給她
to flow northward to her door

188
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:36,262
她只期待紐倫德·阿切爾
and to anticipate eagerly the union of Newland Archer

189
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,389
早日迎娶孫女梅
with her granddaughter, May.

190
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,392
如此一來  紐約的兩大家族
In them, two of New York's best families

191
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,187
終能結為親家
would finally and momentously be joined.

192
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,898
- 再見  媽媽  - 再見
- Bye, Mamma. - Good-bye.

193
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:47,982
艾倫
Ellen!

194
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,234
- 女士們  阿切爾  -  泰莎姨母  梅
- Ladies. Archer. - Aunt Tessa, May.

195
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,322
博弗特  你是罕有的大方
Beaufort, this is a rare favour.

196
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,616
不需要這樣罕有
Unnecessarily rare, I'd say.

197
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,952
我遇見夫人
I met Countess Ellen in Madison Square,

198
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,662
她讓我陪她回家
and she was good enough to let me walk home with her.

199
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,165
有了她  這屋子將會歡樂許多
This house will be merrier now that she's here.

200
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,167
- 謝謝  - 搬凳子來  博弗特
- Thank you. - Beaufort, pull up that tuffet.

201
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,251
這個嗎
This one?

202
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,753
我要和你好好聊聊
I want a good gossip.

203
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,297
你知道我和梅訂婚了
Of course, you already know about May and me.

204
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:14,092
她老怪我沒告訴你
She scolded me for not telling you at the opera.

205
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,594
我早知道了  很開心
Of course I know, and I'm so glad.

206
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,889
這種喜事一定先得告訴親人嘛
One doesn't tell such news first in a crowd.

207
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,400
小心點
Careful there.

208
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,900
別把戒指纏進袖子裏
Don't let your ring catch on your sleeve.

209
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,729
- 再見  艾倫  - 再見  再見
- Good-bye, Ellen. - Good-bye. Good-bye.

210
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,023
再見
Good-bye.

211
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,860
有空來看我
Come and see me someday.

212
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,157
艾倫這麼粗心  公然和尤利斯一起
It's a mistake for Ellen to be seen parading up

213
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,284
走在最多人的第五大道
Fifth Avenue with Julius Beaufort,

214
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:44,247
而且就在她回國第一天
at the crowded hour, the very day after her arrival.

215
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,166
他生性風流
His behaviour is always so flagrant.

216
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,085
連他的太太都知道他有個情婦叫安妮·瑞茵
Even his wife must know about Annie Ring.

217
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,349
西勒頓·傑克遜喜歡頻頻光顧阿切爾的家
Sillerton Jackson enjoyed his frequent visits

218
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:07,228
而並不在乎那一頓晚餐
to the Archer home more than the actual dining.

219
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:11,274
紐倫德·阿切爾的母親和妹妹珍妮都怕生
Newland Archer's mother and his sister Janey were both shy women

220
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:16,154
不擅交際  卻又愛聽八卦
and shrank from society, but they like to be well-informed of its doings

221
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,114
所以全靠這位包打聽先生
and doted on their bachelor friend.

222
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,700
博弗特不懂細節
Certain nuances escape Beaufort.

223
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:24,036
當然啦  博弗特是個大老粗
Necessarily. Beaufort is a vulgar man.

224
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,372
但他有生意手腕
Nevertheless, no business nuances escape him.

225
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,666
很多人托他管理財產
Most of New York trusts him with its affairs.

226
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,502
我祖父常告誡我媽
My grandfather Newland always used to say to Mother,

227
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:35,715
千萬別讓博弗特認識我家的女孩子
"Don't let that fellow Beaufort be introduced to the girls."

228
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,720
至少他有認識君子的機會
At least he's had the advantage of association with gentlemen.

229
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,973
阿切爾家和明戈特家
The Archers and the Mingotts were two of the sturdiest branches

230
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,934
是紐約最顯赫的兩大家族
of New York's tangled family tree.

231
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,855
明戈特家喜愛梅的傳統嫻靜
Granny Mingott's family could embrace May's traditionalism

232
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:54,108
也能容忍艾倫的特立獨行
and tolerate Ellen's unconventionality.

233
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,862
但阿切爾家完全是老派作風
But Archer's family held fast to the old ways.

234
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:01,908
他的母親和妹妹凡事都得仰仗他
His mother and sister relied on him for every security.

235
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:05,369
他的母親對梅的母親說
He would always be, Mrs. Archer assured May's mother,

236
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,496
紐倫德是我們有力的臂膀
their "strong right hand."

237
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,499
我們新的親家表姐去參加舞會了嗎
And our new cousin, was she at the ball, too?

238
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:14,837
我欣賞明戈特家全為艾倫打氣  邀她一同觀賞歌劇
I appreciate the Mingotts wanting to support her, to have her at the opera.

239
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,548
也佩服他們家的向心力
I admire their esprit de corps.

240
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,218
但為何我兒子的喜訊
But why my son's engagement

241
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,346
要跟這女人的來去攪在一起
should be mixed up with this woman's comings and goings,

242
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,555
我真搞不懂
I don't see.

243
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,058
總之她沒去就是了
Well, in any case, she was not at the ball.

244
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,644
算她識趣
At least she had that decency.

245
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,271
先生
Sir?

246
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,648
噢  不
Oh, no.

247
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:37,109
下午她是戴闊邊帽還是軟帽
I wonder if she wears a round hat or a bonnet in the afternoon.

248
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,737
她看戲穿的那衣服好普通
The dress she wore to the opera was so plain and flat.

249
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,989
還是不去比較識趣
I'm sure it was in better taste not to go to the ball.

250
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,532
這與識趣無關  媽媽
It wasn't a question of taste, Mother.

251
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,244
梅說她嫌衣服不夠漂亮才沒去
May said the Countess decided her dress wasn't smart enough.

252
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,329
可憐的艾倫
Poor Ellen.

253
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,999
別忘了她從小的教養有問題
We must always remember the eccentric bringing-up she had.

254
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,584
一個會在成年舞會上
What can you expect of a girl

255
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,504
穿黑緞子的女人還有什麼指望
who was allowed to wear black satin at her coming out ball?

256
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,507
她嫁給伯爵後
It's odd she should've kept such an ugly name as Ellen

257
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,425
還是沒改掉艾倫這個俗氣的名字
when she married the Count.

258
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,344
換成是我  我就改成伊蓮
I should have changed it to Elaine.

259
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,513
為什麼
Why?

260
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,120
我也不知道
I don't know.

261
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,860
這樣聽起來
It sounds more

262
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,410
有波蘭味
Polish.

263
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,147
那反而會太特別
It certainly sounds more conspicuous,

264
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,024
她不會要的
and that can hardly be what she wishes.

265
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,236
如果她選擇特別  又有何不可
Why not? Why shouldn't she be conspicuous if she chooses?

266
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,781
她是嫁錯人  但用不著隱姓埋名
She made an awful marriage. But should she hide her head as if it's her fault?

267
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,701
難道她就該見不得人  好像讓自己丟了臉
Should she go slinking around as if she disgraced herself?

268
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:31,038
她遇人不淑就該遭人白眼
She's had an unhappy life. That doesn't make her an outcast.

269
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,709
我相信明戈特家的態度也跟他一樣
I'm sure that's the line the Mingotts mean to take.

270
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,797
別以為我非跟他們一樣不可
I don't have to wait for their cue if that's what you mean, sir.

271
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,217
聽說她在找房子
I'm told she's looking for a house.

272
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,927
準備長住
She intends to live here.

273
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,346
聽說她準備離婚
I hear she means to get a divorce.

274
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,975
希望如此
I hope she will.

275
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,480
這樁婚姻雖然使她飽受折磨
Understandably her marriage was intolerable.

276
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,984
但也有別的傳言
But there are the rumours, too.

277
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,403
我聽說了  伯爵的秘書
I've heard them. The secretary.

278
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,034
他協助她逃離夫家
He helped get her away from the husband.

279
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,331
聽說伯爵限制她的行動
They say the Count kept her practically a prisoner.

280
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,751
那伯爵的生活方式是很特別
Certainly the Count had his own way of life.

281
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,338
你認識他
You knew him?

282
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,298
我在法國尼斯聽過他的傳聞
I heard of him at Nice.

283
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,134
一表人才
Handsome, they say, but...

284
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,679
但睫毛過多
Eyes with a lot of lashes.

285
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:34,060
他不是玩女人  就是玩瓷器
When he wasn't with women, he was collecting china.

286
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,897
對這兩者都是一擲千金
Paying any price for both, I understand.

287
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,107
那麼為何要怪罪於她
Then where's the blame?

288
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,943
任何人都該像那秘書一樣
Anyone of us under the same circumstances would have helped the Countess,

289
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,820
幫助她
just as the secretary did.

290
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,032
一年後他仍幫著她
He was still helping her a year later then,

291
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:51,035
有人在瑞士洛桑看見他倆同居
because somebody met them living together at Lausanne.

292
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,622
同居
Living together?

293
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:59,001
有何不可  她有權過自己的生活
Well, why not? Who has the right to make her life over if she hasn't?

294
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,713
丈夫愛嫖  妻子就該守活寡嗎
Why should we bury a woman alive if her husband prefers to live with whores?

295
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,240
沒有人要她守寡啊
It's hardly a question of entombment.

296
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,440
她不是到這裏來了嗎
The Countess is here after all.

297
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,763
難道你贊成
Or do you believe

298
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,849
男女享有同等的自由嗎
a woman should share the same freedoms as men?

299
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,395
沒錯  我相信
I suppose I do. Yes, I do.

300
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:21,315
她的觀點顯然跟你一樣新潮
Well, apparently Count Olenski takes a similarly modern view.

301
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:25,736
我從未聽說伯爵試法使她回頭
I never heard of him lifting a finger to get his wife back.

302
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:32,076
三天後  發生了一件不可思議的事
Three days later, the unthinkable happened.

303
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,371
曼森·明戈特夫人發出請帖
Mrs. Manson Mingott sent out invitations

304
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:38,165
邀請大家前往餐敘
summoning everyone to a formal dinner.

305
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:42,461
如此隆重的晚宴絲毫馬虎不得
Such an occasion demanded the most careful consideration.

306
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,922
餐具全是上上之選
It required the appropriated plate.

307
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,299
桌旁須多添三名僕役
It called for three extra footmen,

308
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,176
每道菜都有兩盤外
two dishes for each course

309
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,137
還要檸檬甜酒
and a Roman punch in the middle.

310
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,559
請帖上寫著
The dinner, New York read on the invitation,

311
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,270
為歡迎奧蘭斯卡伯爵夫人而設宴
was "to meet the Countess Olenska."

312
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,484
紐約名門全都婉謝
And New York declined.

313
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,656
遺憾  恕難奉陪
"Regret unable to accept."

314
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,616
連我們自家人也不願賞臉
And from some of our own family.

315
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:17,955
根本沒有人為她著想  就這樣給她難堪
No one cares enough even to conceal their feelings about the Countess.

316
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,123
真是情何以堪
This is a disgrace.

317
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:22,585
他們活在一個充滿寓意的世界裏
They all lived in a kind of hieroglyphic world.

318
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:26,297
從不具體表達真實的感受
The real thing was never said or done or even thought,

319
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:30,426
只是以約定俗成的寓意表示
but only represented by a set of arbitrary signs.

320
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,804
紐倫德懂得這些寓意
Archer knew these signs.

321
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,849
他們根本懶得掩飾
They were not subtle and were not meant to be.

322
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:39,435
這不僅是代表不理不睬
They were more than a simple snubbing.

323
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,146
根本就是對她封殺
They were an eradication.

324
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,774
有個地方  他可以去陳情
There was a single court of appeal.

325
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:49,487
他要請馮·德·萊登老爺子主持公道
He would plead their case before the van der Luydens.

326
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:55,075
你認為此事是有人在暗中搞鬼
And all this, you think, is due to some intentional interference by...

327
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,244
我敢肯定是拉瑞·萊弗茨
Larry Lefferts. Yes, sir, I'm certain of it.

328
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,831
馮·德·萊登夫婦德高望重
The van der Luydens dwelled above the city's families

329
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:04,668
地位崇高得近乎神聖
in a kind of super-terrestrial twilight.

330
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:09,507
老爺子處事自有公斷
Archer appealed to their exquisitely refined sense of tribal order.

331
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,300
紐倫德也直言無諱
And he spoke plainly.

332
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,843
每當萊弗茨太太
Whenever poor Gertrude Lefferts begins

333
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,222
懷疑先生出軌時
to suspect her husband of something,

334
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:20,392
他就收斂一陣子來轉移注意力
Larry starts making some great diversionary fuss to show how moral he is.

335
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:23,938
我最不喜歡這事的原則
Well, it's the principle that I dislike.

336
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,816
如果一家名門的子弟
I mean to say, if a member of a well-known family

337
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,319
獲得另一家名門的支持
is backed by that family,

338
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,321
整件事應該就不必爭議了
it should be considered final.

339
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:37,284
大家冷落伯爵夫人一事  我相信應該來問問你們
We all felt this slight on the Countess should not pass without our consulting you.

340
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:42,164
我們要為侄兒聖·奧斯特利公爵洗塵
So, we are giving a little dinner for our cousin, the Duke of St Austrey,

341
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,833
他搭的俄羅號  下周會到
who arrives next week on the Russia.

342
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,087
相信內人路易莎會和我一樣開心
I'm sure Louisa will be as glad as I am,

343
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:52,800
如果奧蘭斯卡伯爵夫人前來參加晚宴
if Countess Olenska will let us include her among our guests.

344
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,974
當晚的場面極為隆重
The occasion was a solemn one,

345
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,935
但伯爵夫人姍姍來遲
but the Countess Olenska arrived rather late,

346
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:07,648
而她對自己的粗心仍毫不自覺
signalling a carelessness of which she was entirely unaware.

347
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,776
她大搖大擺  毫無愧容
She entered without haste or embarrassment.

348
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,822
走進坐滿了紐約達官貴人的客廳
The drawing room in which New York's most chosen company

349
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,825
可謂是冠蓋雲集
was somewhat awfully assembled.

350
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,035
奧蘭斯卡伯爵夫人
Countess Olenska.

351
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,622
晚上好
Good evening.

352
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,125
- 歡迎光臨  - 晚上好
- We're delighted you're here. - Good evening.

353
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,711
聖·奧斯特利公爵  這是奧蘭斯卡伯爵夫人
The Duke of St Austrey, may I present Countess Olenska.

354
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,673
他們動用了特瓦納·喬治二世時的餐具
The Trevenna George II plate was out.

355
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:36,427
還有來自東印度公司的馮·德·萊登·羅斯托夫細瓷
So was the van der Luyden Lowestoft from the East India Company.

356
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:39,430
以及達哥納王冠德比瓷器
And the Dagonet Crown Derby.

357
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:43,350
馮·德·萊登夫婦的這頓晚宴非同小可
Dining with the van der Luydens was at best no light matter.

358
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,562
能跟這位公爵親戚共進晚餐
Dining there with a duke who was their cousin

359
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:50,024
簡直猶如宗教儀式般隆重
was almost a religious solemnity.

360
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:54,320
馮·德·萊登家執行的教訓令人懾服
When the van der Luydens chose, they knew how to give a lesson.

361
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,611
失陪一下
Excuse me.

362
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:42,326
在紐約上流社會的社交場合中
It was not the custom in New York drawing rooms

363
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,579
女士起身離開一名男士
for a lady to get up and walk away from one gentleman

364
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,999
去跟另一名男士交談  於禮不合
in order to seek the company of another,

365
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,960
但伯爵夫人沒有守這規則
but the Countess did not observe this rule.

366
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,718
我想讓你跟我談談梅
I want you to talk to me about May.

367
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,430
你和公爵是舊識
You knew the Duke before?

368
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,600
在尼斯  每年冬天都會見到他
From Nice. We used to see him every winter.

369
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:11,355
他很喜歡賭博  常來我家玩大錢
He's very fond of gambling, and he used to come to our house a great deal.

370
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,732
他每晚都穿著同一件西服
He likes to wear the same suit every evening.

371
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,568
他認為它會帶來好運
He thinks it brings him luck.

372
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,029
我覺得他是世上最無趣的人
I think he's the dullest man I ever met.

373
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:23,033
但他在這兒卻被捧上天了
But he seems to be admired here.

374
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,538
知道我最心儀紐約的哪一點嗎
May I tell you what most interests me about New York?

375
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:32,751
不盲目遵循別人的傳統
Not all the blind obeying of tradition, somebody else's tradition.

376
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:36,714
把美國搞成外國的翻版就太可惜了
It seems stupid to have discovered America only to make it a copy of another country.

377
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,258
哥倫布會如此大費周章
Do you suppose Christopher Columbus would have taken all that trouble

378
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,427
只為和萊弗茨夫婦一同欣賞歌劇嗎
just to go to the opera with Larry Lefferts?

379
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,934
如果哥倫布知道拉瑞·萊弗茨在這兒
Well, I think if he'd suspected that Lefferts were here,

380
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:51,937
他就不會出航了
the Santa Maria might never have left port.

381
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,483
梅的看法也和你一樣嗎
And May, does she share these views?

382
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,819
就算一樣  她也不會說出口
If she does, she'd never say so.

383
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,072
你深愛著她嗎
Are you very much in love with her?

384
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,408
至死不渝
As much as a man can be.

385
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,368
這份愛可有極限
Do you think there's a limit?

386
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,957
就算有  我也還沒觸碰到
If there is, I haven't found it.

387
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,671
如此說來  這是真愛
It's really and truly a romance then,

388
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,424
而不是恭奉父母之命
not in the least arranged.

389
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:25,095
美國人的婚姻是不靠媒妁之言的
Have you forgotten? In our country we don't allow our marriages to be arranged.

390
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,266
對  我忘了  抱歉
Yes, I forgot. I'm sorry.

391
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,685
我總是犯這樣的錯誤
I sometimes make these mistakes.

392
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,981
我總忘了這裏樣樣都好
I don't always remember that everything here is good.

393
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:39,193
而那兒一無是處
That was bad where I came from.

394
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,823
抱歉
I'm so sorry.

395
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,116
不用
No.

396
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:52,956
這裏全都是你的朋友
But you know you are among friends here.

397
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,043
我知道  這就是我回來的原因
Yes, I know. That's why I came home.

398
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,090
晚上好  路易莎
Good evening, Louisa.

399
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,634
容我介紹梅·韋蘭德
May I present May Welland.

400
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,344
你一定想去陪梅
You'll want to be with May.

401
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,513
認識你十分榮幸
I'm so pleased to meet you.

402
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:10,265
她身旁已圍滿了我的情敵
She's already surrounded. I have so many rivals.

403
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,600
是啊
Yes.

404
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,895
那就再陪我多坐一會兒吧
Then stay with me a little longer.

405
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,190
好
Yes.

406
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:21,735
達哥納先生  容我介紹奧蘭斯卡伯爵夫人
Mr. Urban Dagonet, may I present the Countess Olenska.

407
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,362
幸會
How do you do, my dear?

408
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,655
幸會
How do you do?

409
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,658
明天下午五點  我等你
Tomorrow then, after 5:00 I'll expect you.

410
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,452
明天見
Tomorrow.

411
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,329
失陪一下
Excuse me.

412
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:44,132
你人真好
It was good of you to devote yourself to Madame Olenska

413
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,969
肯這樣為奧蘭斯卡夫人出力
so unselfishly, dear Newland.

414
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,763
是我請亨利去救你的
I told Henry he really must rescue you.

415
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,934
我從未見過梅如此美麗
I think I've never seen May looking lovelier.

416
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:58,564
公爵認她是這裏最出色的女子
The Duke thinks her the handsomest woman in the room.

417
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:04,296
這是我的榮幸
It was my pleasure.

418
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,342
阿切爾先生
Mr. Archer.

419
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:13,096
你對寒舍有何感覺
So how do you like this odd little house?

420
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,806
我自以為猶如天堂
To me, it's like heaven.

421
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:18,060
- 你佈置得很雅致  - 是啊
- You've arranged it delightfully. - Yes.

422
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,771
我設法帶了些東西回來
Some of the things I managed to bring with me.

423
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:23,815
婚變後的殘骸
Little pieces of wreckage.

424
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,945
至少不像馮·德·萊登家那麼陰森
At least it's less gloomy than the van der Luydens',

425
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,781
在這裏獨處也不會太煎熬
and not so difficult to be alone.

426
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:34,117
儘管很多人認為馮·德·萊登家很陰森
I am sure it's often thought the van der Luydens' is gloomy,

427
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,536
但我倒是第一次親耳聽見
though I've never heard it said before.

428
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,997
你真的喜歡獨處嗎
But tell me, do you really like to be alone?

429
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,709
有朋友作伴就不覺的寂寞
As long as my friends keep me from being lonely.

430
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:48,507
你已經決定喜歡那兒
I see you've already chosen your corner.

431
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,633
是的
Yes.

432
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,009
- 請坐  - 謝謝
- Please, sit. - Thank you.

433
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,724
這是我最喜歡的時刻
This is the hour I like best.

434
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:59,977
你呢
Don't you?

435
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,187
我還以你早已將時間遺忘
I was afraid you'd forgotten the hour.

436
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:05,107
大概博弗特有時也很有趣吧
I am sure Beaufort can be very intriguing.

437
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:11,738
他帶我看了幾處房子  大家都勸我一定要搬
He took me to see some houses. I'm told I must move.

438
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,075
儘管這裏是高級住宅區
Even though this street seems perfectly respectable.

439
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:18,286
- 沒錯 但不夠時髦  - 時髦
- Yes, but it's not fashionable. - Fashionable?

440
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,956
時髦與否真的那麼重要嗎
Is fashion such a serious consideration?

441
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,584
對那些沒有更重要的事可操心的人而言
Among people who have nothing more serious to consider.

442
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,715
或許是我太獨立了吧
Perhaps I've been too independent.

443
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:35,429
我只求有人給我關愛和安全感
All I really want is to feel cared for and safe.

444
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,686
馮·德·萊登夫婦可說是全力出動了
Thank you. The van der Luydens do nothing by halves.

445
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,814
昨晚紐約名流都來捧你的場
All New York laid itself out for you last night.

446
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:49,192
他們人真好  我玩得很開心
It was so kind. Such a nice party.

447
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,777
奶油還是檸檬
Cream or lemon?

448
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,364
檸檬  謝謝
Lemon, please.

449
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:58,660
馮·德·萊登家族在社會上最有影響力
The van der Luydens are the most powerful influence in New York society.

450
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:02,330
他們因路易莎的健康不佳而絕少宴客
They very seldom receive because of Cousin Louisa's health.

451
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,791
或許就是這個理由吧
Perhaps that's the reason then.

452
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,168
謝謝  理由
Thank you. "The reason"?

453
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:09,463
愈神秘愈有影響力
For their influence. They make themselves so rare.

454
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:13,091
但你一定得告訴我
But, of course, you must tell me.

455
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,761
不  你來告訴我
No, it's you telling me.

456
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:22,184
- 謝謝  - 我們可以互相幫助
- Thank you. - Then we can both help each other.

457
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,686
可是我更需要幫忙
But I need help so much more.

458
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:30,400
已經有許多人告訴你該怎麼做了
There are so many people all ready to tell you what to do.

459
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:37,407
我獨居  恐怕會使許多人不以為然
I think they're all a little angry with me for setting up for myself.

460
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:41,286
至少你的家人會指點你
Still your family can advise you, show you the way.

461
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,164
紐約真的是個大迷宮嗎
Is New York such a labyrinth?

462
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:48,627
我以為條條道路都如第五大道一般寬敞筆直
I thought it was all straight up and down, like Fifth Avenue.

463
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,160
每條街都有編號
All the cross streets numbered,

464
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,400
每件東西都貼有大標籤
and big, honest labels on everything.

465
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,968
每件東西都有標籤  除了人以外
Everything is labelled, but everybody is not.

466
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,849
我需要你的提醒
Then I must count on you for warnings, too.

467
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,811
年長的女士都喜歡你  他們樂意伸出援手
All the older women like and admire you. They want to help.

468
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:09,815
我知道  只要她們沒聽見什麼傳聞
I know. I know, as long as they don't hear anything unpleasant.

469
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:15,779
難道這裏沒人肯聽實話
Does no one here want to know the truth, Mr. Archer?

470
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,782
真正的寂寞是住在這種好人之中
The real loneliness is living among all these kind people

471
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:21,326
他們要你戴上假面具
who only ask you to pretend.

472
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,874
不  千萬別這麼做
No, no, you mustn't.

473
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,336
奧蘭斯卡夫人
Madame Olenska.

474
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,007
艾倫
Ellen.

475
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,971
難道這裏的人也都不哭嗎
Does no one cry here either?

476
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,682
大概是沒有哭的必要吧
I suppose there's no need to.

477
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,367
阿切爾先生  晚上好
Mr. Archer, good evening.

478
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,536
今早沒見到你
We didn't see you this morning

479
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,997
我們不知是否要送花給韋蘭德小姐
and we weren't sure whether to send Miss Welland the usual...

480
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:10,125
以後每天一束百合
Lilies-of-the-valley. Yes, I think we better make that a standing order.

481
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,751
好的  先生
Very good, sir.

482
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:20,343
還有那些黃玫瑰  我給你另一個地址
And those yellow roses. I'll give you another address.

483
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,428
好的
Very good.

484
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,099
喬治
George!

485
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,180
{\an8}奧蘭斯卡夫人  紐倫德·阿切爾先生

486
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,478
阿切爾先生  兩束花分送兩處
Mr. Archer, two separate orders.

487
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:36,860
馬上送出嗎
They'll go at once?

488
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:37,986
馬上  先生
At once, sir.

489
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,882
能聞著百合香醒來
It's wonderful to wake every morning

490
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,550
感覺真好
with lilies-of-the-valley in my room.

491
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,885
就像你在身旁
It's like being with you.

492
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:05,472
昨天花送遲了  我忘了時間
They came late yesterday, I know. Somehow the time got away from me.

493
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,724
但你總會記起來的
But still you always remember.

494
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:10,852
我也送了玫瑰給艾倫  可以嗎
I sent some roses to your Cousin Ellen, too. Was that right?

495
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,120
當然可以
Very right.

496
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,100
但今天午餐時她沒提起
She didn't mention it at lunch today though.

497
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:18,151
她說博弗特先生送給她漂亮的蘭花
She said she got some wonderful orchids from Mr. Beaufort,

498
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,821
亨利·馮·德萊登也送她一籃康乃馨
and a whole hamper of carnations from Cousin Henry van der Luyden.

499
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,241
她好開心
She was so very delighted.

500
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,327
難道歐洲人都不送花嗎
Don't people send flowers in Europe?

501
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,829
我知道你覺得訂婚期太長
I know you do consider it a long time.

502
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,956
沒錯
Very long.

503
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,208
可是奇弗斯夫婦訂婚一年半
But the Chiverses were engaged for a year and a half.

504
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,752
萊弗茨夫婦更長達兩年
Larry Lefferts and Gertrude were engaged for two.

505
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,255
媽媽希望我們能依照傳統
I'm sure Mamma expects something customary.

506
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,548
你從小就有主見
Ever since you were little, your parents let you have your way.

507
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,718
你也快二十二歲了  何妨跟你母親直說
You're almost 22. Just tell your mother what you want.

508
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:47,555
我不能拒絕她對我的最後要求
I couldn't refuse her the very last thing she'd ask of me as a little girl.

509
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,308
難道我們就不能任性一點嗎
Can't we just strike out for ourselves, May?

510
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,520
難道我們應該私奔
Shall we elope?

511
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,273
如果你願意  有何不可
Well, if you would, why not?

512
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,443
你是真心愛我  我好開心
You do love me, Newland. I'm so happy.

513
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,612
你可以更快樂的
Well, why not be happier?

514
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,156
無法更快樂了  親愛的
I couldn't be happier, dearest.

515
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,409
我拿戒指給艾倫看
Did I tell you I showed Ellen the ring?

516
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:10,036
她說沒見過比這更漂亮的
She thought it was the most beautiful setting she ever saw.

517
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,707
連巴黎的款式也比不上
She said there was nothing like it in the Rue de la Paix.

518
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,502
我好愛你  紐倫德
I do love you, Newland.

519
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,921
你做的每件事都好特別
Everything you do is so special.

520
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:25,427
這案子很棘手  我得借重你的長才
I want to call on your legal skills for a rather delicate matter.

521
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:28,305
奧蘭斯卡伯爵夫人想離婚
Countess Olenska wants to sue her husband for divorce.

522
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:32,559
有人說她想再婚  儘管她矢口否認
It's been suggested she means to marry again, although she denies it.

523
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,812
請恕我因訂婚之故
Because of... I beg your pardon, sir, but because of my engagement,

524
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:39,649
你可否另請高明
perhaps one of the other members of the firm could consider this matter.

525
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,444
正因為你與她將有親屬關係
But precisely because of your prospective alliance,

526
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:46,114
她的家人也指明要你
and considering that several members of the family have already asked for you,

527
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,490
希望你能考慮接下
I'd like you to consider the case.

528
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:51,995
這是家務事  自家人出面協調比較妥當
It's a family matter. Perhaps it's best settled by the family.

529
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,663
他們的態度相當明確
Their position is clear.

530
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:57,917
他們堅決反對離婚
They're entirely and rightly against a divorce.

531
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:02,130
但奧蘭斯卡伯爵夫人堅持要請教律師
But Countess Olenska still insists on a legal opinion.

532
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:05,050
但說真格的  何必要離婚
But really, what's the use of a divorce?

533
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,927
她在美國  他在英國
She's here. He's there.

534
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,638
中間隔著大西洋
The whole Atlantic's between them.

535
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:14,517
伯爵最近很慷慨
As things go, Olenski's acted generously.

536
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:18,271
他主動歸還一部分錢
He's already returned some of the money without being asked.

537
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,690
但也不會再多給了
She'll never get a dollar more than that.

538
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,944
當然啦  她並不在乎錢
Although I understand she attaches no importance to the money.

539
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:29,991
所以最好還是依她家人的意願
Considering all that, the wisest thing really, is to do as the family say.

540
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,828
就讓事情這樣子吧
Just let well enough alone.

541
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,126
我認為此事應由她決定
I think that's for her to decide.

542
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,884
你是否仔細想過
Have you considered the consequences

543
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,053
離婚會有什麼影響嗎
if the Countess decides for divorce?

544
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,971
對她的影響嗎
The consequences for the Countess?

545
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,390
對每個人的影響
For everyone.

546
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:58,144
伯爵對她只是做出大概的控訴
I don't think the Count's accusations amount to anything more than vague charges.

547
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,397
但總會惹來閒言閒語
It will make for some talk.

548
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,441
我聽說過伯爵夫人和那秘書
Well, I have heard talk about the Countess and the secretary.

549
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,527
沒看見文件前就聽說了
I heard it even before I read the legal papers.

550
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,904
這終究不是一件令人舒服的事
It's certain to be unpleasant.

551
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:09,989
不令人舒服
Unpleasant?

552
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:13,993
離婚總是令人不舒服吧
Divorce is always unpleasant. Don't you agree?

553
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,288
當然
Naturally.

554
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,873
那麼我就拜託你了
Then I can count on you?

555
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,000
她全家都拜託你了
The family can count on you.

556
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,461
你會勸她打消此意吧
You will use your influence against a divorce?

557
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:27,799
我先和她談談再說吧
I can't promise that, not until I've talked to the Countess.

558
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,760
我真搞不懂你
I don't understand you, Mr. Archer.

559
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,637
為何不讓你的親家
You want to marry into a family

560
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,223
免掉離婚官司呢
with a scandalous divorce suit hanging over it?

561
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:40,186
這跟我的婚約是兩回事
I don't think that has anything to do with the case.

562
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:43,857
可否派人將這個送給伯爵夫人
Can someone take this for me to the Countess, please?

563
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,100
{\an8}重要

564
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,200
{\an8}我必須見你

565
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,864
謝謝
Thank you.

566
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:55,368
敢不去你就死定了
You refuse such an invitation on threat of death.

567
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,786
真有這麼可怕
Is it so bad?

568
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,164
不然就等著大家慢慢折磨你吧
Not if you have a taste for slow agony.

569
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,082
我禁不起折磨的
That's something I've neglected to cultivate.

570
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,501
在馮·德·萊登家住三天
Three days at Skuytercliff with the van der Luydens.

571
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,462
帶著皮裘大衣和熱水瓶去吧
I think you better take your fur and a hot water bottle.

572
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,880
那房裏有那麼冷嗎
Is the house that cold?

573
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,173
不  但路易莎令人不寒而慄
No, but Louisa is.

574
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,632
阿切爾先生
Mr. Archer.

575
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,051
星期天到狄摩尼餐廳來吧
Join me at Delmonico's on Sunday instead.

576
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,138
我請你吃生蠔
I'm having a nice oyster supper in your honour.

577
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:18,516
包廂  風雅人士作陪
Private room, congenial company. Artists and so on.

578
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,895
真令人心動  我回來後還沒見過藝術家
That's very tempting. I haven't met a single artist since I've been here.

579
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:25,273
我可以介紹一些畫家給你認識
I know one or two painters I could bring to see you if you'd allow me.

580
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,735
畫家  紐約還有畫家嗎
Painters? Are there any painters in New York?

581
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,447
謝謝  但我想認識的是歌星
Thank you, but I was really thinking of singers,

582
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:35,241
演員  和音樂家等演藝人員
actors, musicians, dramatic artists.

583
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,412
我夫家常有許多音樂家來
There were always so many at my husband's house.

584
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,623
明天再告訴你決定吧
May I write tomorrow and let you know?

585
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,875
現在太晚了
It's too late to decide this evening.

586
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,377
- 現在叫晚嗎  - 是的
- Is this late? - Yes.

587
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,923
因為我還有要事和阿切爾先生談
Because I still have to talk business with Mr. Archer.

588
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,640
當然啦  紐倫德
Of course, Newland,

589
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:59,800
如果你能讓她改變心意
if you can persuade the Countess to change her mind about Sunday,

590
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,620
歡迎你來作陪
you can join us, too.

591
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,773
你認識畫家  經常來往嗎
You know painters then? You live in their milieu?

592
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,274
那倒沒有
Not exactly.

593
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,026
你喜歡畫作
But you care about such things?

594
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:13,905
當然  我在歐洲從不錯過畫展
Immensely. When I'm in Paris or London, I never miss an exhibition.

595
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,698
我很留意畫壇動態
I try to keep up.

596
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,367
以前我也熱愛繪畫
I used to care immensely, too.

597
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,911
我的生活總充滿了藝術氣息
My life was full of such things,

598
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:25,375
但我要忘掉過去  完全美國化
but now I want to cast off all my old life to become a complete American

599
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,460
就像其他人一樣
and try to be like everybody else.

600
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,506
你永遠都不會和其他人一樣
I don't think you'll ever quite be like everybody else.

601
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,799
別這麼說
Don't say that to me, please.

602
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,009
我想忘掉過去
I just want to put all the old things behind me.

603
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,135
我知道
I know.

604
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,930
萊特布賴爾先生告訴過我
Mr. Letterblair told me.

605
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,558
萊特布賴爾先生
Mr. Letterblair?

606
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:45,687
對  是他要我來的  我們在同一家事務所
Yes, I've come because he asked me to. I'm in the firm.

607
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:50,358
這麼說是你負責我的案子
You mean it'll be you who'll manage everything for me?

608
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,068
我可以和你談  那太好了
I can talk to you. That's so much easier.

609
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,195
對  我就是為此而來的
Yes, I'm here to talk about it.

610
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,489
所有文件我都看過了
I've read all the legal papers.

611
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:00,743
還有伯爵寄來的信件
And the letter from the Count.

612
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,458
寫得很惡毒
It was vile.

613
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:10,336
可是如果決定打官司
But if he chooses to fight the case,

614
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,964
他可能說一些  呃
he can say things that might be...

615
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,387
對你很不利的話
That might be disagreeable to you.

616
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,000
並鬧得滿城風雨
And say them publicly,

617
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:24,240
那些話是毀滅性的  即使
so that they could be damaging even if...

618
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:26,352
即使什麼
If?

619
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,274
即使毫無根據
Even if they were unfounded.

620
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:37,030
我在這兒  他怎麼中傷我
What harm could accusations like that do me here?

621
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,867
此地的流言殺傷力極強
Perhaps more harm than anywhere else.

622
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:44,787
儘管法律允許離婚  但民情不容
Our legislation favours divorce, but our social customs don't.

623
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,166
沒有例外嗎
Never?

624
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,418
尤其是如果女方
Well, not if the woman

625
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:55,173
起碼表面上  無論怎樣輕微也好
has appearances in the least degree against her,

626
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:59,719
以任何非傳統方法也好
has exposed herself by any unconventional behaviour,

627
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:05,099
有難堪的緋聞
to offensive insinuations and...

628
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,770
我的家人也是這麼說的
Yes, so my family tell me.

629
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:15,276
我們的家人  你將成為我的表妹夫
Our family. You'll be my cousin soon.

630
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:20,740
你也同意他們的說法
And you agree with them?

631
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:34,087
什麼事讓你冒險離婚
What could you possibly gain that would make up for the scandal?

632
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:37,965
自由
My freedom.

633
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,053
你不是已經自由了嗎
But aren't you free already?

634
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,016
職責所在  我得讓你知道
It's my business to help you see these things just the way

635
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:51,604
那些關愛你的人對離婚的看法
the people who are fondest of you see them, all your friends and relations.

636
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:54,816
如果我沒告訴你
If I didn't show you honestly how they judge such matters,

637
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,609
就是沒盡到責任
it wouldn't be fair of me, would it?

638
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,823
沒錯
No, it wouldn't be fair.

639
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,499
好吧
Very well. I'll...

640
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,502
我依你就是了
Do as you wish.

641
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:18,756
我
I...

642
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,676
我真的很想幫你
I do want to help you.

643
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:23,845
你的確幫了我
You do help me.

644
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,309
晚安  表妹夫
Good night, cousin.

645
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,453
求求你  別哭得那麼凄慘
For mercy's sake, don't cry so bitterly.

646
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,037
忘掉我所做的一切
Forget what I've done.

647
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,622
除非你答應我
On one condition.

648
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,876
不管是什麼條件我都答應
I accept it, whatever it may be.

649
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:59,046
別再說你愛我
Never speak a word of love to me again!

650
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,298
永遠不會
Never!

651
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:07,472
我發誓
On my honour.

652
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,286
上天保佑你
Heaven bless you.

653
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,222
永別了
Farewell.

654
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,200
精彩極了
It's fascinating.

655
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,500
每年這戲中一幕
Every season, the same play, the same scene,

656
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,344
總是令觀眾感動不已
the same effect on the audience.

657
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:30,346
很精彩吧  紐倫德
Remarkable, isn't it, Newland?

658
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,849
比我在倫敦看的還精彩
I'm enjoying it even more than the London production.

659
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,852
你出國還看呀
You see this play even when you travel?

660
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,354
- 我出國就是為了不想看這戲  - 那天是晚宴
- I travel to get away from it. - So was it a dinner?

661
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:40,731
斯特拉瑟斯太太作東
It was a reception at Mrs. Struthers'

662
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,860
雖訂在禮拜天
given on the Lord's Day but with champagne

663
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,028
但不僅有香檳和在桌上歌唱
and singing from the table tops.

664
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,114
聽說還有舞會
People say there was dancing.

665
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,116
這麼說是法國式的禮拜天
It was a real French Sunday then?

666
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,453
墮落的早期可真令人興奮
Well, dissipation can be wonderfully energising in the early stages...

667
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:03,296
你認為她的情人明天會送黃玫瑰嗎
Do you think her lover will send her a box of yellow roses tomorrow morning?

668
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,055
我
I...

669
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,433
我也在想這個問題
I was thinking about that, too.

670
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,146
告別的那一幕
The farewell scene.

671
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,900
我知道
Yes, I know.

672
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,694
我也深受感動
It touches me as well.

673
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:31,490
散場時我總是盡快離去  以免那一幕的情景揮之不去
I usually leave the theatre after that scene to take the picture away with me.

674
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:40,124
我收到梅從聖奧斯汀捎來的信
I had a letter from May from St Augustine.

675
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,293
他們總是南下避寒
They always spend the winter there,

676
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:44,837
因為她母親有支氣管炎
on account of her mother's bronchitis.

677
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,926
梅不在時你都做些什麼
And what do you do while May is away?

678
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,515
工作
I do my work.

679
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:11,697
我要告訴你  你的建議很對
I do want you to know what you advised me was right.

680
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:18,204
世事總令人飽受煎熬  我很感激你
Things can be so difficult sometimes, and I'm so grateful.

681
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,972
隔天  紐倫德·阿切爾為了尋找黃玫瑰
The next day Newland Archer searched the city in vain

682
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,890
走遍全紐約卻依然沒找到
for yellow roses.

683
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:40,685
他寫了一封信給奧蘭斯卡夫人
From his office, he sent a note to Madame Olenska

684
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,895
表示當天想去看她
asking to call that afternoon,

685
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,315
並要信差等她的答覆
and requesting reply by messenger.

686
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,777
但她卻毫無表示  次日亦然
There was no reply that day or the next.

687
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:55,500
當黃玫瑰再度出現時  紐倫德卻匆匆走過
And when yellow roses were again available, Archer passed them by.

688
00:49:56,785 --> 00:50:00,454
第三天他才接到她的信
It was only on the third day that he heard from her by post,

689
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:03,040
是從馮·德·萊登的別墅寄出的
from the van der Luydens' country home.

690
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:08,254
紐倫德  那天在劇院看見你後  我便趕緊逃離
"Newland, I ran away the day after I saw you at the play,

691
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,631
好心的路登夫婦收留了我
"and these kind friends have taken me in.

692
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:14,343
我想靜靜地思考
"I wanted to be quiet and think things over.

693
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:18,347
這裏很安全  真希望你也在這裏
"I feel so safe here. I wish that you were with us.

694
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,141
謹此
"Yours sincerely."

695
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:27,900
萊弗茨邀他去哈德遜河度週末
He had received an invitation from the Lefferts for a weekend on the Hudson,

696
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,943
他連忙答應
and he hoped it was not too late to reply.

697
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:34,321
因為那兒離馮·德·萊登的別墅不遠
Their house was not far from the van der Luydens'.

698
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,171
我來瞭解你到底在逃避什麼
I came to see what you were running away from.

699
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,008
我知道你會來的
I knew you'd come.

700
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,551
那表示你想見我
That shows you wanted me to.

701
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:57,887
梅在信上說要我照顧你
Cousin May wrote. She asked you to take care of me.

702
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:00,222
- 其實不用她吩咐  - 為什麼
- I didn't need to be asked. - Why?

703
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:03,017
我就這麼孤苦無依嗎
Does that mean I'm so helpless and defenceless?

704
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:06,103
還是這兒的女人都太有福氣  什麼都不缺
Or that women here are so blessed, they never feel need?

705
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,605
缺什麼
What sort of need?

706
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,065
噢  拜託  別考我
Ohh. Please don't ask me.

707
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,317
我們說的不是同一門語言
I don't speak your language.

708
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:18,491
亨利把祖傳老宅借給我住  我帶你去看
Henry left the old Patroon house open for me. I want you to see it.

709
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:30,461
信中的你並不開心
When you wrote me, you were unhappy.

710
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:34,548
對  但有你在身旁就不同了
Yes, but I can't feel unhappy when you're here.

711
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,934
我不能久留
I shan't be here long.

712
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,268
我知道
I know.

713
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:49,855
如果你真的希望我來
Ellen, if you really wanted me to come,

714
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:54,777
如果真要我的幫助
if I'm really to help you,

715
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,325
你必須老實說你究竟在躲什麼
you must tell me what you're running from.

716
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,835
你是在躲避他嗎
Is he what you were running from?

717
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:56,463
還是在等他
Or what you expected?

718
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:57,631
我不知道他也來了
I didn't know he was here.

719
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:04,263
你好  博弗特  這邊請
Hello, Beaufort. This way.

720
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,682
奧蘭斯卡夫人正在等你
Madame Olenska was expecting you.

721
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:07,808
你好
Hello.

722
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:11,103
你讓我找得好苦
Well, you've certainly led me on a bit of a chase.

723
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:16,984
我大老遠來  只想告訴你  房子找到了
All this way just to tell you I'd found the perfect little house for you.

724
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:22,156
還沒公開出售  要買就得趁現在
It's not on the market yet, so you must take it at once.

725
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:26,118
阿切爾  你也來隱居嗎
Well, Archer, rusticating?

726
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:36,837
那一夜  他訂的書從倫敦寄來
That night he did not take the customary comfort

727
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:40,090
卻無法令他像往日一般開懷
in his monthly shipment of books from London.

728
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:44,386
單調的日子使他倍感無趣
The taste of the usual was like cinders in his mouth.

729
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:45,930
有時他甚至覺得
And there were moments when he felt

730
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:49,225
他快被往後的日子活埋
as if he were being buried alive under his future.

731
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:55,606
紐倫德  明天晚點來  我得向你解釋
"Newland, come late tomorrow. I must explain to you.

732
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:56,941
艾倫
"Ellen."

733
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:24,093
發生了什麼事嗎
Newland. Has anything happened?

734
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:26,762
對  我非見你不可
Yes. I found I had to see you.

735
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:34,645
- 怎麼啦  - 沒什麼
- What is it? - Nothing.

736
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:39,608
你每天做些什麼事
So tell me what you do all day?

737
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:44,238
有些人從費城和巴爾的摩而來
Well, there are a few very pleasant people

738
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:48,367
他們在旅館舉行野宴
from Philadelphia and Baltimore who are picnicking at the inn,

739
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,453
莫家弄了個草地網球場
and the Merrys are setting up a lawn tennis court,

740
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:54,999
可是沒有人會打
but nobody here's really heard of the game yet.

741
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,400
只有我和凱特帶了球拍
I have my racket, of course, and so does Kate Merry,

742
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,879
可她有嚴重的支氣管炎
but she's had this terrible case of bronchitis.

743
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,882
她還沒完全康復
She's still not quite got over it yet, so...

744
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:10,431
我來這裏
But I thought... I came here because I thought

745
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:14,018
就是希望你能避開那些社交
I could persuade you to break away from all that,

746
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,145
盡快跟我結婚
to advance our engagement.

747
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:21,442
你知道我有多麼想娶你嗎
Don't you understand how much I want to marry you?

748
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:23,986
我們何必再浪費一年呢
Why should we dream away another year?

749
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,280
我就是不明白
I'm not sure I do understand, Newland.

750
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:33,120
你對我是否變了心
Is it because you're not certain of feeling the same way about me?

751
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:35,914
你在胡說些什麼
What on earth do you mean?

752
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,168
是不是有第三者
Is there someone else?

753
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,754
第三者
Someone else?

754
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,381
你我之間
Between you and me?

755
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:49,011
我們把話談開來吧
Let's talk frankly, Newland.

756
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:52,139
我覺得你變了  特別是在我們訂婚之後
I've felt a difference in you, especially since our engagement.

757
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:53,223
什麼
Since our engagement?

758
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:55,392
如果沒有  談談也無妨
If it's untrue, then it won't hurt to talk about it.

759
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,811
如果有  我們更需要談談
And if it is true, then why shouldn't we talk about it now?

760
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:59,980
或許你找錯了對象
I mean, you might have made a mistake.

761
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:02,399
如果你不是我的理想對像
If I'd made some sort of a mistake, would I be down here,

762
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,318
我會催你盡快與我結婚嗎
asking you to hurry our marriage?

763
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:07,112
或許吧
I don't know. You might.

764
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,615
使自己沒有選擇的餘地
It would be one way to settle the question.

765
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:16,246
兩年前在新港
In Newport, two years ago,

766
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:19,041
我們訂婚之前
before we were promised,

767
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,543
大家都說你另有所愛
everyone said there was someone else for you.

768
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,379
我看過你們在舞會時
I even saw you with her once,

769
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,672
一起坐在陽台上
sitting together on a veranda at a dance.

770
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:29,343
她進門時神情落寞
When she came into the house, her face looked so sad.

771
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:33,180
我真為她難過  訂婚之後
I felt sorry for her, and even after, when we were engaged,

772
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:35,265
我仍忘不掉她的神情
I could still see how she looked and...

773
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:39,019
你就是在擔心這個
Is that... Is that all you've been concerned about?

774
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,023
那早就過去了
It's long passed.

775
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,237
那麼是其他事嗎
Then is there something else?

776
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:51,240
沒有  當然沒有
No. Of course not.

777
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,720
無論如何  紐倫德
Whatever it may have been, Newland,

778
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,914
我不能將快樂建築在別人的痛苦上
I can't have my happiness made out of a wrong to somebody else.

779
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:02,709
假如你對別人許下誓言
If promises were made, or if you feel in some way pledged to this person,

780
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,837
即使對方得因此而離婚
even if it means her getting a divorce,

781
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,506
也別為我而捨棄她
then, Newland, don't give her up because of me.

782
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,007
這根本就是子虛烏有
There are no pledges.

783
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,844
我沒對別人許下誓言
There are no promises that matter.

784
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:14,555
我一直想對你說
That's all I've been trying to say.

785
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:18,267
我們之間沒有第三者
There is no one between us. There is nothing between us, May.

786
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:24,356
所以我才催你
Which is precisely my argument for getting married.

787
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:26,692
盡快與我結婚
Quickly.

788
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:38,620
他覺得她又變回了純真的小女孩
He could feel her dropping back to inexpressive girlishness.

789
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:41,790
她總算釋懷了
Her conscience had been eased of its burden.

790
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:45,752
他心想  真美妙  如此的深情
It was wonderful, he thought, how such depths of feeling

791
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:49,590
卻和如此缺乏想像力共聚一身
could coexist with such an absence of imagination.

792
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:54,720
- 成功了嗎  - 沒有
- And did you succeed? - No.

793
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:58,140
還是希望您能幫我在四月完婚
No, I'd still like to be married in April, with your help.

794
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:00,476
你總算見識了明戈特家的厲害
Now you're seeing the Mingott way.

795
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,144
他們果真如此頑固不靈
Is this really so difficult?

796
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:04,646
這個家族一向如此
The entire family is difficult.

797
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,565
個個是老古板
Not one of them wants to be different.

798
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:09,610
不然就像艾倫的父母一樣
When they are different, they end up like Ellen's parents.

799
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:12,446
簡直是歐陸的遊牧民族
Nomads, continental wanderers.

800
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,573
帶著艾倫到處去
Dragging Ellen about,

801
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:18,243
為她花了大錢受教育  但總是斷斷續續
lavishing on her an expensive, but incoherent education.

802
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,829
在所有孫輩中
Out of all of them, I don't believe there's one

803
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:24,500
就屬艾倫最像我了
that takes after me but my little Ellen.

804
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,335
你很有眼光
You've got a quick eye.

805
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:29,087
為何沒娶她
Why in the world didn't you marry her?

806
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,760
她不在國內  我無緣娶她
Well, for one thing, she wasn't there to be married.

807
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,346
說得也是
No, to be sure.

808
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:41,391
現在還是娶不成  伯爵  你知道
And she's still not. The Count, you know.

809
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,685
寫信給萊特布賴爾先生
He's written to Mr. Letterblair.

810
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:48,774
要她回心轉意  條件隨她開
He wants her back, on her own terms.

811
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:53,529
伯爵倒沒為自己強辯
The Count doesn't defend himself, I will say that.

812
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:57,533
如果她執意不回去  那將會是她的損失
And Ellen will be losing a great deal if she stayed here.

813
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,243
那裏有她熟悉的生活
There's her old life,

814
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:03,956
尼斯的花園  珠寶  音樂和清談
gardens at Nice, jewels, of course, music and conversation.

815
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:07,125
她說她在歐洲默默無聞
She says she goes unnoticed in Europe,

816
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,671
但我知道  光是她的肖像畫就有九幅
but I know her portrait's been painted nine times.

817
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:15,717
此外  還有一個有心賠罪的丈夫
All this, and the remorse of a guilty husband.

818
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,803
我寧可她死
I'd rather see her dead.

819
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,389
真的嗎
Would you really?

820
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:25,727
你必須記得婚姻就是婚姻  艾倫已為人妻
We should remember marriage is marriage, and Ellen is still a wife.

821
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,648
艾倫  瞧瞧誰來了
Ellen! See who's here!

822
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,276
我知道
Yes, I know.

823
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,654
我去問你媽你去哪兒了
I went to see your mother to ask where you've gone.

824
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:41,326
你老是不給回信  我還擔心你病了
Since you never answered my note, I was afraid you might be ill.

825
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,996
因為他正忙著結婚
Well, he was in such a rush to get married, that's why.

826
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,998
他一下火車就往我這兒跑
Fresh off the train, and straight here.

827
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:50,502
求我為他說情  讓他早點把心上人娶進門
He wants me to use all my influence just to marry his sweetheart sooner.

828
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:55,716
這個嘛
Well, surely, Granny, between us,

829
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,343
我們都能勸說韋蘭德家照他的意思去辦
we can persuade the Wellands to do as he wishes.

830
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:01,722
紐倫德  聽見沒  一針見血  就像我一樣
There, Newland, you see? Right to the quick of the problem, like me.

831
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:04,224
我才跟他說他應該娶你的
I told him he should have married you.

832
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:07,728
他怎麼說
And what did he say?

833
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:09,229
噢  乖孫女啊
Oh, my darling,

834
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:11,315
自己去找答案吧
I leave you to find that out.

835
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:19,948
可惜我不能久留
I wish I didn't have to leave.

836
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,950
我會盡快來看你的
I shall see you very soon, I hope.

837
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,201
好
Fine.

838
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,371
我送你
I'll see you out.

839
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,875
何時可去找你
When can I see you?

840
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:52,105
斯特拉瑟斯家會在七點派車來接我
The Struthers are sending the carriage at 7:00.

841
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:57,903
晚上好
Good evening.

842
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:01,740
誰發神經送花給我
Who's ridiculous enough to send me a bouquet?

843
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,618
我沒要去舞會  也沒訂婚
I'm not going to a ball, and I'm not engaged.

844
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:05,900
納斯塔西婭
Nastasia!

845
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,900
{\an8}尤利斯·博弗特先生  謹獻

846
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
就是有人這麼神經
Some people are always ridiculous.

847
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:10,749
把這些花送給街尾那戶人家
Take these to that nice family down the street.

848
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:20,509
嗯  她說的話有些真實
Well, I'll tell you, in almost everything she says,

849
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:23,762
也有虛假的成分
there's something true and something untrue.

850
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,500
為什麼
Why?

851
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,800
奶奶跟你說了些什麼
What has Granny been telling you?

852
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:31,895
她認為你會回到丈夫身旁
I think she believes you might go back to your husband.

853
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:37,734
她相信你至少會考慮一下
I think she believes you might at least consider it.

854
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:40,862
很多人相信我會做好些東西
A lot of things have been believed of me.

855
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,949
如果她相信我會考慮
But if she thinks I would consider it,

856
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,910
那表示她在代我考慮
that also means she would consider it for me,

857
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:51,123
也同時在考慮讓你提早結婚
as Granny is weighing your idea of advancing the marriage.

858
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:04,469
我和梅在佛州已經把話談開了
May and I had a frank talk in Florida.

859
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:08,974
那或許是我們的第一次
It's probably our first.

860
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,645
她想晚一點結婚  給我多一點時間
She wants a long engagement, to give me time.

861
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:17,858
多一點時間幹嘛
Time for what?

862
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:22,320
她認為我急著與她結婚
She thinks I want to marry her at once...

863
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:27,993
是為了逃避某人
To get away from someone that I care for

864
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,244
一個我用情更深的人
more.

865
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:37,210
讓你有時間為別的女人放棄她
Time to give her up for another woman?

866
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,505
如果我夠絕情的話
If I want to.

867
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,176
她簡直是個聖人
That's very noble.

868
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,343
沒錯
Yes.

869
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:48,180
真是荒謬至極
But it's ridiculous.

870
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:50,849
怎麼說
Why?

871
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:54,603
因為根本沒有第三者
Because there is no other woman?

872
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:55,771
是因為
No.

873
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:58,690
因為我非她莫娶
Because I don't mean to marry anyone else.

874
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:09,618
那個第三者也深愛著你嗎
This other woman, does she love you too?

875
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:13,872
根本沒有第三者  梅所懷疑的人根本就
There is no other woman! The person May was thinking of was never...

876
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:23,673
一定是接你的馬車來了
That must be your carriage.

877
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,050
對
Yes, I...

878
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,471
我該走了
I suppose I should be leaving soon.

879
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:34,768
到斯特拉瑟斯家去嗎
To Mrs. Struthers'?

880
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:41,650
對  人家邀我去  我就赴約  一個人太寂寞了
Yes. I must go where I'm invited, or I should be too lonely.

881
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:49,074
為何不同我一起去呢
Why not come with me?

882
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:15,100
其實梅猜得沒錯
May guessed the truth.

883
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:20,230
的確有第三者
There is another woman.

884
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,736
但不是她擔心的那一個
Only, not the one she thinks.

885
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,035
別對我調情  太多人對我調情
Don't make love to me, too many people have done that.

886
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,328
我是真心的
I've never made love to you.

887
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:36,705
如果可以
But you are the woman I would've married

888
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:38,081
我要娶你
if it had been possible for either of us.

889
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:40,208
是你讓它成為不可能的
You can say that when you're the one who's made it impossible?

890
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:43,253
- 我  - 你叫我別離婚
- I've made it? - Isn't it you who made me give up divorcing?

891
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:45,500
你在這屋裏勸我要犧牲
Didn't you talk to me here, in this house,

892
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,600
免得遭人議論
about sacrifice and sparing scandal?

893
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:51,303
為了成全你們  我乖乖聽你的話
And for May's sake, and for yours, I did what you asked me!

894
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,305
你丈夫在信裏說你
There were things in your husband's letter...

895
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:56,182
那封信唬不了我的
I had nothing to fear from that letter, absolutely nothing.

896
01:04:56,642 --> 01:05:00,353
我只擔心你和梅  還有我的家人
I was just afraid of scandal for the family and you and May.

897
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:06,985
艾倫
Ellen.

898
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:10,447
艾倫
Ellen.

899
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,533
沒有什麼
Nothing's...

900
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:16,828
沒有什麼是無法挽回的
Nothing's done that can't be undone.

901
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:19,164
我仍單身
I'm still free.

902
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:23,668
你也可以
You can be, too.

903
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:27,088
求你告訴我
Please, Ellen.

904
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:10,674
現在我還能娶梅嗎  你願意看見我娶她嗎
Lord, can I marry May now? Do you see me marrying May now?

905
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:13,176
你認為你可以問她這個嗎
I don't see you putting that question to May, do you?

906
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,636
事已至此
But I have to.

907
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,054
我別無選擇
It's too late to do anything else.

908
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:18,723
這不是真的
You say that because it's the easiest thing to say at this moment,

909
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,350
你只是在逃避
not because it's true.

910
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:22,060
我真搞不懂你
I don't understand you.

911
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,854
因為你不知道
You don't understand because you don't yet realise

912
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:27,482
你已改變了我
how you've changed things for me.

913
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:29,693
你對你所做的事渾然不知
You don't know all that you've done.

914
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:30,819
我做的事
All I've done?

915
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:35,115
你暗中為我做的事
All the good things you've done for me, Newland, that I never knew.

916
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:38,952
你去找馮·德·萊登  只因大家都不理我
Going to the van der Luydens' because people refused to meet me.

917
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:41,496
在舞會上宣佈婚訊
Announcing your engagement at the ball so there would be

918
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:44,916
如此一來多了一個家族支持我
two families standing behind me instead of one.

919
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:48,753
從前我並不知道別人是如此地鄙視我
I never understood how dreadful people thought I was.

920
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,339
直到外婆有一天不小心說溜了嘴
Granny blurted it out one day.

921
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:53,883
我好傻
I was stupid. I never thought...

922
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:56,469
我總以為到了紐約我就自由了
New York meant freedom to me.

923
01:06:56,554 --> 01:07:00,432
每個人都那麼好  那麼樂於見到我
Everyone seemed so kind, and glad to see me.

924
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:06,021
他們怎會知道禁慾的痛苦
But they never knew what it meant to be tempted,

925
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:08,231
但你全都瞭解
but you did, you understood.

926
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,568
這些我從不知道
I'd never known that before.

927
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:15,697
而且比我所知的一切都還可貴
And it's better than anything I've known.

928
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:25,415
若你狠心  你也不會快樂
Newland, you couldn't be happy if it meant being cruel.

929
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,251
我怎能要你變心
If we act any other way,

930
01:07:28,335 --> 01:07:31,796
我就是因你的人品而愛你
I'll be making you act against what I love in you most.

931
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:36,051
我再也無法任性而為
And I can't go back to that way of thinking.

932
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:41,139
難道你不懂嗎  除非放棄你  否則我無法愛你
Don't you see? I can't love you, unless I give you up.

933
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:25,767
艾倫  奶奶果然不同凡響
"Ellen, Granny's telegram was successful.

934
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:29,771
我媽媽已決定讓我們在四月結婚  只剩一個月了
"Grandma and Mamma agreed to marriage after Easter, only a month.

935
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:33,733
我會通知紐倫德  無法形容我內心的喜悅
"I will telegraph Newland. I'm too happy for words, and love you dearly.

936
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:35,944
感激你的梅
"Your grateful cousin, May."

937
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:58,480
{\an8}導演客串出演攝影師一角

938
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:58,967
婚禮之前盛傳
There had been wild rumours right up to the wedding day

939
01:08:59,051 --> 01:09:02,428
明戈特老夫人要親自觀禮
that Mrs. Mingott would actually attend the ceremony.

940
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:06,808
她甚至請木匠去量教堂的長椅
It was known that she had sent a carpenter to measure the front pew,

941
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:09,978
瞭解是否需要加大
in case it might be altered to accommodate her.

942
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:14,524
不過最後她還是作罷
But this idea, like the great lady herself, proved to be unwieldy,

943
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:17,777
只決定在上午宴請大家
and she settled for giving the wedding-breakfast.

944
01:09:19,363 --> 01:09:22,115
奧蘭斯卡伯爵夫人表示
The Countess Olenska sent her regrets.

945
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:24,450
將有遠行而無法出席
She was travelling with an aunt.

946
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:29,289
但她送了一匹蕾絲賀喜
But gave the bride and groom an exquisite piece of old lace.

947
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:33,751
兩位姨媽提供了蜜月小套房
Two elderly aunts in Rhinebeck offered a honeymoon cottage.

948
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:38,882
當時英國貴族也流行這樣
And, since it was thought very English to have a country house on loan,

949
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:41,676
小倆口欣然接受
their offer was accepted.

950
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:45,638
不過後來發現小屋不能住
When the house proved suddenly uninhabitable, however,

951
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:49,142
但亨利·馮·德萊登慷慨借出
Henry van der Luyden stepped in to offer an old cottage

952
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:52,478
他住家附近的別墅
on his property nearby.

953
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:56,107
梅接受了  好讓紐倫德驚喜
May accepted the offer as a surprise for her husband.

954
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,984
她沒見過這房子
She'd never seen the house,

955
01:09:58,068 --> 01:10:00,695
只聽艾倫提起過
but her cousin, Ellen, had mentioned it once.

956
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:03,907
她說全美國只有這裏
She had said it was the only house in America

957
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:06,993
讓她覺得幸福可期
where she could imagine being perfectly happy.

958
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:13,833
他們到了上流社會蜜月必經之地  梅從未去過
They travelled to the expected places, which May had never seen.

959
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:16,711
紐倫德在倫敦訂做新衣
In London, Archer ordered his clothes.

960
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:20,173
兩人同游國家畫廊  一起欣賞歌劇
And they went to the National Gallery, and sometimes to the theatre.

961
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:22,342
希望這套衣服不會太俗氣
I hope I don't look ridiculous.

962
01:10:22,426 --> 01:10:25,178
我沒在倫敦參加過晚宴
I've never dined out in London.

963
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:28,514
英國婦女的晚禮服和其他人一樣
English women dress just like everybody else in the evening, don't they?

964
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:30,767
可是她們在劇院裏
How can you say that when they're always at the theatre

965
01:10:30,851 --> 01:10:33,728
都穿著舊禮服
in old ball dresses and bare heads?

966
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:37,232
或許把新衣留在家裏穿吧
Well, maybe they save their new dresses for home.

967
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:38,524
這麼說我不該穿這一件
Then I shouldn't have worn this.

968
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:40,985
你這樣很好看
No, you look very fine.

969
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:44,656
真的很好看
Really quite beautiful.

970
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:53,706
她在巴黎添購了許多新衣
In Paris, she ordered her clothes.

971
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:56,584
出自御用裁縫之手  買了幾大箱
There were trunks of dresses from Worth.

972
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,753
他們還逛了圖勒花園
They visited the Tuileries.

973
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:10,932
梅的雙手也被製成了大理石雕像
May's hands were modelled in marble at Roche's studio.

974
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:13,434
他們偶爾應邀作客
And occasionally, they dined out.

975
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:21,484
莫泊桑真的教你寫作嗎
But tell me. You were saying that you were actually advised here by Maupassant?

976
01:11:21,568 --> 01:11:25,697
對  不幸的是他勸我就此封筆
Yes. Unfortunately, I was advised not to write.

977
01:11:29,326 --> 01:11:31,244
阿切爾沉浸在新婚的喜悅中
Archer embraced his new marriage,

978
01:11:31,328 --> 01:11:35,707
甚至恢復了對婚姻的看法
even as he reverted to his old inherited ideas about matrimony.

979
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:39,877
畢竟依照傳統總是比較省事
It was less trouble to conform with tradition.

980
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,547
解放給梅也是徒然
There was no use trying to emancipate a wife

981
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:45,425
她絲毫不覺得自己受到束縛
who hadn't the dimmest notion that she was not free.

982
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:46,509
我們在倫敦時
When we were in London,

983
01:11:46,593 --> 01:11:48,845
只在國家畫廊待了一天
we could only manage one day at the National.

984
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:52,223
我們還去了卡太太和哈太太家
We were taken up by a Mrs. Carfry and Mrs. Harle...

985
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:56,060
我們相談甚歡  他很有意思
We had an awfully good talk. He's an interesting fellow.

986
01:11:56,186 --> 01:11:59,355
我們聊了書本等等的事
We talked about books, and many different things.

987
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:02,984
我想邀他共進晚餐
I thought I'd invite him to dinner.

988
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:05,028
- 那個法國人  - 對
- The Frenchman? - Yes.

989
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:07,113
我和他談話的機會不多
I didn't have much chance to talk to him,

990
01:12:07,197 --> 01:12:09,991
他不是很粗俗嗎
but wasn't he a little common?

991
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:11,242
粗俗
Common?

992
01:12:12,619 --> 01:12:15,204
我認為他很聰明
I thought he was clever.

993
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:18,499
我倒沒發現到這一點
I suppose I shouldn't have known if he was clever.

994
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:24,714
我不邀他就是了
Then, I won't ask him to dine.

995
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:30,928
他突然感到一陣涼意
With a chill, he knew that in future,

996
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:35,099
以後有很多問題  將會如此為他先行解決
many problems would be solved for him in this same way.

997
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:42,023
人們說新婚後半年最難相處
The first six months of marriage were usually said to be the hardest.

998
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:44,108
之後
And after that, he thought they would have

999
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:48,112
雙方的棱角都被磨平了
pretty nearly finished polishing down all the rough edges.

1000
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:50,907
但梅施的壓力  把他最想保持的棱角
But May's pressure was already wearing down

1001
01:12:50,991 --> 01:12:54,660
都快要磨平了
the very roughness he most wanted to keep.

1002
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:57,246
對於奧蘭斯卡夫人的渴望
As for the madness with Madame Olenska,

1003
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:59,499
他強迫自己
Archer trained himself to remember it

1004
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:03,378
將它當成婚前最後一次考驗
as the last of his discarded experiments.

1005
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:07,507
她是他記憶之中最令他悲傷
She remained in his memory simply as the most plaintive,

1006
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:10,802
哀痛的  一絲幽魂
and poignant of a line of ghosts.

1007
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,600
{\an8}新港射箭俱樂部  八月

1008
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:46,963
她真是厲害
She's very deft.

1009
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:50,675
她在其他場合才不懂一矢中的
Yes, well, that's the only kind of target she'll ever hit.

1010
01:13:57,224 --> 01:14:00,268
沒人會嫉妒梅的勝利
No one could ever be jealous of May's triumphs.

1011
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:02,937
她好像不論輸贏
She managed to give the feeling that she would have been

1012
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:05,148
也永遠如此嫻靜
just as serene without them.

1013
01:14:08,318 --> 01:14:11,946
但在她那平和甜美的簾幕之後
But what if all her calm, her niceness,

1014
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:13,865
是否
were just a negation,

1015
01:14:14,366 --> 01:14:17,702
只是一片空白呢
a curtain dropped in front of an emptiness?

1016
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:21,372
紐倫德感覺自己從未將簾幕掀起
Archer felt he had never yet lifted that curtain.

1017
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:25,877
好漂亮
Quite stunning, isn't it?

1018
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:30,506
這獎品是博弗特提供的嗎
It's Julius Beaufort who donates the club's prizes, isn't it?

1019
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:32,800
標準的博弗特作風
This looks like him, of course.

1020
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:35,011
留著當傳家之寶吧
It will make quite an heirloom, my dear.

1021
01:14:35,095 --> 01:14:38,389
將來送給你的長女吧
You should leave it to your eldest daughter.

1022
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:42,018
怎麼了  難道你不生女兒  只生兒子
What's the matter? Aren't there going to be any daughters? Only sons?

1023
01:14:42,102 --> 01:14:43,769
我說錯了嗎
What, can't I say that either?

1024
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:45,396
瞧她害臊的
Look at her blushing.

1025
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:48,983
艾倫  艾倫  你在樓上嗎
Ellen! Ellen, are you upstairs?

1026
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:51,944
她剛從樸茨茅斯來
She's over from Portsmouth, spending the day with me.

1027
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:55,323
真討厭  她不想住在這裏
It's such a nuisance. She just won't stay in Newport.

1028
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:59,577
非要呆在那破地方  叫什麼來著  布朗克斯
Insists on putting up with those... What's their names? Blenkers.

1029
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:04,081
我老早就懶得跟年輕人辯了
But I gave up arguing with young people 50 years ago. Ellen!

1030
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:05,249
抱歉  夫人
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1031
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:07,627
艾倫小姐出去了
Miss Ellen's not in the house.

1032
01:15:07,711 --> 01:15:08,878
她走了
She's left?

1033
01:15:08,962 --> 01:15:11,506
我看見她去海邊了
I saw her going down the shore path.

1034
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:16,677
乖  去把她找回來
Run down and fetch her like a good grandson.

1035
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:19,388
我要跟梅聊聊博弗特的八卦
May and I will have a gossip about Julius Beaufort.

1036
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:22,308
快去  她也想見見你們
Go ahead. I know she'll want to see you both.

1037
01:15:22,976 --> 01:15:26,437
博弗特真的給了情婦安妮·瑞茵鑽石手鐲嗎
Is it true Beaufort has given Annie Ring a diamond bracelet?

1038
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:29,524
聽說他打算要帶她來
I hear he even plans to bring her to Newport.

1039
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,450
暌違一年半
He had heard her name often enough

1040
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:42,578
他還是經常聽見她的名字
during the year and a half since they had last met.

1041
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:46,707
他對她的動態時有所聞
He was even familiar with the main incidents of her life.

1042
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:50,419
但這並未激起任何漣漪
But he heard all these accounts with detachment,

1043
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:54,590
只像是聽見一個死人的陳年往事
as if listening to reminiscences of someone long-dead.

1044
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:59,178
但過去卻突然鮮活起來
But the past had come again into the present,

1045
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:02,640
好像是最近出土的原始洞穴
as in those newly-discovered caverns in Tuscany,

1046
01:16:02,766 --> 01:16:05,726
孩子們帶著火把闖入
where children had lit bunches of straw,

1047
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:09,730
卻看見早已作古之人  在牆上盯著你看
and seen old images staring from the wall.

1048
01:16:20,617 --> 01:16:23,244
他決定給自己一個機會
He gave himself a single chance.

1049
01:16:23,328 --> 01:16:27,415
帆船駛過燈塔前  她若轉身
She must turn before the sailboat crosses the lime rock light.

1050
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:30,668
他就走向她
Then, he would go to her.

1051
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:23,971
真遺憾你沒找到她  聽說她變了
I'm sorry you didn't find her, but I've heard she's so changed.

1052
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:25,139
變了
Changed?

1053
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:27,141
都不理會老朋友了
So indifferent to her old friends,

1054
01:17:27,225 --> 01:17:30,978
還獨自去樸茨茅斯避暑  她搬到華盛頓
summering in Portsmouth, moving to Washington.

1055
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:33,606
或許是嫌我們乏味無趣
Sometimes, I think we've always bored her.

1056
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:36,817
或許回到丈夫身旁會使她快活些
I wonder if she wouldn't be happier with her husband after all.

1057
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:39,445
我從不知道你如此殘忍
I don't think I've ever heard you be cruel before.

1058
01:17:39,529 --> 01:17:40,821
殘忍
Cruel?

1059
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:44,825
即使是魔鬼也不會覺得人在地獄會快樂
Even demons don't think people are happier in Hell.

1060
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:47,703
當初她就不該遠嫁海外
Then she shouldn't have married abroad.

1061
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:50,122
讓我來  走  駕
Here, let me. Go on. Walk on.

1062
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:53,918
布朗克斯母女  邀布朗克斯母女吃飯
The Blenkers? A party for the Blenkers?

1063
01:17:54,878 --> 01:17:56,379
誰啊
Who are they?

1064
01:17:56,963 --> 01:18:00,633
她們住樸茨茅斯  艾倫住在她們家避暑
The Portsmouth people, I think. The ones Countess Olenska is staying with.

1065
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:04,887
西勒頓夫婦敬邀週三下午三點
"Professor and Mrs. Emerson Sillerton request the pleasure Wednesday afternoon,

1066
01:18:04,971 --> 01:18:09,183
歡迎布朗克母女們蒞臨
"At 3:00 o'clock, punctually to meet Mrs. and the Misses Blenker.

1067
01:18:09,267 --> 01:18:11,477
紅色院牆  凱瑟琳街
"Red gables, Catherine Street."

1068
01:18:11,561 --> 01:18:13,771
我們不好意思不去
I don't think we can decline.

1069
01:18:14,606 --> 01:18:18,150
何必去呢  他是個考古學家
I don't see why, really. He's an archaeologist.

1070
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:21,112
他可是西勒頓·傑克遜的表兄
And he's Sillerton Jackson's cousin.

1071
01:18:22,155 --> 01:18:23,364
好吧
Of course.

1072
01:18:23,448 --> 01:18:25,116
一定要有人去才行
Some of us will have to go.

1073
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:28,285
我去  珍妮  陪我去吧
I'll go over. And, Janey, why don't you come with me?

1074
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:32,623
艾倫一定會去的  你可以見到她的
I'm sure Cousin Ellen will be there. It will give you a chance to see her.

1075
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:37,086
紐倫德  你一個人可以打發時間吧
Newland, you can find a way to spend your afternoon, can't you?

1076
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:41,090
我想我會好好利用時間
I think for a change, I'll just save it instead of spending it.

1077
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:46,887
也許我會開車去農場  看看布魯厄姆的新馬
Maybe I'll drive to the farm to see about a new horse for the brougham.

1078
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:52,268
至少傑克遜家沒有選擇杯賽日來舉辦他們的宴會
Well, at least the Jacksons didn't choose the day of the Cup Race for their party.

1079
01:18:52,352 --> 01:18:54,562
當然啦  如果真是那樣我也不感到奇怪
Of course, I shouldn't be surprised if they had.

1080
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:08,677
你好
Hello?

1081
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:15,935
抱歉  是你按鈴嗎  我正在吊床上睡覺
I'm sorry. Did you ring? I've been asleep in the hammock.

1082
01:20:19,105 --> 01:20:21,398
把你吵醒了  抱歉
Well, I didn't mean to disturb you.

1083
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:24,193
布朗克小姐嗎  我叫紐倫德·阿切爾
Are you Miss Blenker? I'm Newland Archer.

1084
01:20:24,569 --> 01:20:26,695
久仰大名
Yes. I've heard so much about you.

1085
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:29,323
我想來這兒買匹新馬
I came to the island to look for a new horse.

1086
01:20:29,407 --> 01:20:31,659
本想登門拜訪  但沒人在家
I thought I'd call, but the house seems to be empty.

1087
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:33,744
對  大夥兒都去赴宴去了
It is empty. They're all at the party.

1088
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:38,457
只有發燒的我和奧蘭斯卡伯爵夫人沒去
Everyone's there, but me with my fever, and Countess Olenska.

1089
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:41,252
噢  你找到我的傘了
Oh, you found my parasol.

1090
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:46,423
這是我最愛的一把傘  喀麥隆制的
It's my best one. It's from the Cameroons.

1091
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:49,134
真漂亮
Well, it's very pretty.

1092
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:50,886
伯爵夫人不在嗎
The Countess was called away?

1093
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:53,430
對  她接到來自波士頓的電報
Yes. A telegram came from Boston.

1094
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:56,058
她說她得去兩天
She said she might be gone for two days.

1095
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:59,311
我好喜歡她的髮型  你呢
I do love the way she does her hair, don't you?

1096
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:01,814
好像是小說中的女主角
It reminds me of Sir Walter Scott.

1097
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:07,444
你不知道  我明天也要去波士頓一趟
You don't know... I'm sorry, but I have to be in Boston tomorrow.

1098
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:10,489
你知道她住在哪兒嗎
You wouldn't happen to know where she was staying?

1099
01:21:43,523 --> 01:21:44,732
艾倫
Ellen.

1100
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:48,068
我是來出差的  剛到
I'm here on business. I just got here, actually.

1101
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:00,581
你的髮型變了
You're doing your hair differently.

1102
01:22:00,665 --> 01:22:02,583
女傭沒來
Only because my maid's not with me.

1103
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:07,338
她留在樸茨茅斯了  我只來兩天  所以沒帶她來
She stayed back in Portsmouth. I'm here only for two days. It didn't seem worthwhile.

1104
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,506
你一個人來的
You are travelling alone?

1105
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:11,592
對
Yes.

1106
01:22:11,676 --> 01:22:15,012
你認為太危險嗎
Why? Do you think it's a little dangerous?

1107
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:17,222
只是不太符合傳統
Well, it's unconventional.

1108
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:18,515
大概是吧
Yes, I suppose it is.

1109
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:22,019
我剛做了更有違傳統的事
I've just done something so much more unconventional.

1110
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:25,189
我拒絕拿回屬於自己的錢
I refused to take back money that belonged to me.

1111
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:29,360
有人找你談了嗎
Someone came with an offer?

1112
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:34,531
什麼條件
What were the conditions?

1113
01:22:35,825 --> 01:22:37,368
我回絕了
I refused.

1114
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:39,954
- 告訴我是什麼條件  - 也沒什麼
- Tell me the conditions. - Nothing unbearable, really.

1115
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:43,374
只是偶爾扮演女主人
Just to sit at the head of his table now and then.

1116
01:22:45,877 --> 01:22:48,379
他不計代價要你回去嗎
And he wants you back at any price?

1117
01:22:49,255 --> 01:22:51,840
很高的代價
Well, it's a considerable price.

1118
01:22:53,176 --> 01:22:55,678
至少對我而言
At least, it's considerable for me.

1119
01:22:57,305 --> 01:22:58,806
你是來見他的嗎
So, you came to see him?

1120
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:02,643
在這兒見我丈夫  怎麼可能
My husband? Here? No, of course not.

1121
01:23:02,727 --> 01:23:04,520
他托人來傳話
No. He sent someone.

1122
01:23:06,314 --> 01:23:07,648
他的秘書
His secretary?

1123
01:23:09,943 --> 01:23:11,276
對
Yes.

1124
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:14,947
他還沒離開
He's still here, in fact.

1125
01:23:15,031 --> 01:23:19,118
他堅持留下  等待我改變心意
He insisted on waiting, in case I changed my mind.

1126
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:27,334
紐倫德  你一點都沒變
You haven't changed, Newland.

1127
01:23:31,297 --> 01:23:33,841
我變了  見到你後才又變回樣
I had changed until I saw you again.

1128
01:23:35,093 --> 01:23:36,176
求求你別再說了
Please don't.

1129
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:38,637
讓我陪你一天吧  我不會說任何煩心的話
Just give me the day. I'll say anything you like, or nothing.

1130
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:41,849
你允許我才開口說話
I won't speak unless you tell me to.

1131
01:23:41,933 --> 01:23:44,309
我只想陪陪你
All I want is some time with you.

1132
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,896
他會去旅館找你嗎
I want to get you away from that man. Is he coming to hotel?

1133
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:50,315
- 十一點會來  - 我們該走了
- At 11:00... - Well, let's go now.

1134
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:57,948
我得留個紙條
I'll have to leave a note at the hotel.

1135
01:23:58,033 --> 01:23:59,533
寫在這上面吧  我有紙
Write on this. I have the paper.

1136
01:23:59,617 --> 01:24:02,745
瞧  這都是命運的安排
You see how everything is predestined?

1137
01:24:02,829 --> 01:24:06,540
看見沒  這是新式自來水筆
And these? Have you seen these? The new stylographic pen.

1138
01:24:06,624 --> 01:24:07,708
就像
It's just like...

1139
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:12,171
就像甩溫度計裏的水銀
It's like jerking down the mercury in a thermometer. Now.

1140
01:24:12,922 --> 01:24:14,173
試試看
Try that.

1141
01:24:15,675 --> 01:24:17,301
沒法寫
It's not working.

1142
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:20,429
應該沒問題了
That should do it.

1143
01:24:21,973 --> 01:24:24,850
- 要我拿進去嗎  - 等我一下
- Shall I take it in? - I'll be only a moment.

1144
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:11,105
那天你怎麼沒去海邊找我
Why didn't you come down to the beach to get me the day I was at Granny's?

1145
01:25:11,189 --> 01:25:13,774
因為你沒回頭
Because you didn't turn around. I swore...

1146
01:25:15,819 --> 01:25:19,029
我發誓你回頭我才叫你
I swore I wouldn't call you unless you turned around.

1147
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:22,241
我是故意不轉身的
But I didn't look around on purpose.

1148
01:25:23,868 --> 01:25:25,327
你知道
You knew?

1149
01:25:25,411 --> 01:25:28,080
你看見你的馬車
I recognised the carriage when you drove in.

1150
01:25:29,249 --> 01:25:31,416
所以我才去海邊
So, I went to the beach.

1151
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:34,378
躲我躲得遠遠的
To get as far away from me as you could.

1152
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:35,879
對  盡我所能
As I could, yes.

1153
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:38,507
我們還是得面對現實
Well, you see, it's no use. It's better if we face each other.

1154
01:25:38,591 --> 01:25:40,467
我只想對你坦白
I only want to be honest with you.

1155
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:43,428
所以你欣賞博弗特
Honest? Isn't that why you always admired Julius Beaufort?

1156
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:47,141
他比我們任何人都坦白
He was more honest than the rest of us, wasn't he? We've no character.

1157
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:49,476
我們全是假道學
No colour, no variety.

1158
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:54,314
你為何不回歐洲
I don't know why you don't just go back to Europe.

1159
01:25:55,275 --> 01:25:58,068
- 我想是為了你吧  - 我
- I believe that's because of you. - Me?

1160
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:01,530
我聽了一個女人的話  娶了另一個女人
I'm the man who married one woman because another one told him to.

1161
01:26:04,868 --> 01:26:07,619
你答應過今天不談這些事的
You promised not to say such things today.

1162
01:26:07,954 --> 01:26:10,205
我沒有辦法不提
I can't keep that promise.

1163
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:13,500
梅呢  梅的感受呢
What about May? What about how May feels?

1164
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:16,670
如果你把我的婚姻當成是某種勝利
If you're using my marriage as some victory of ours,

1165
01:26:16,754 --> 01:26:20,424
你就沒有不回去的理由
then there's really no reason on earth why you shouldn't go back.

1166
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:24,595
你讓我首度見識到現實
You gave me my first glimpse of a real life.

1167
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:27,890
又要我虛偽度日
And then you told me to carry on with a false one.

1168
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:32,436
沒有人能承受這種苦
No one can endure that.

1169
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:37,482
我正在承受
I'm enduring it.

1170
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:49,203
我知道你會回去的
What's the use? I know you'll go back.

1171
01:26:49,287 --> 01:26:51,830
我不會的
I won't. Not yet.

1172
01:26:53,291 --> 01:26:55,000
只要你我還熬得下去  我不會的
Not as long as we both can stand it.

1173
01:26:55,084 --> 01:26:56,543
你不該過這種日子
This is not a life for you.

1174
01:26:57,378 --> 01:27:00,255
我心甘情願  只要它是你生活的一部分
It is, as long as it's part of yours.

1175
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,897
你不會回去吧
You won't go back?

1176
01:27:18,524 --> 01:27:20,150
我不會回去
I won't go back.

1177
01:27:26,991 --> 01:27:29,201
他將再次遇見她
He would see her again.

1178
01:27:29,285 --> 01:27:31,995
在劇院或在宴會上
At the theatre, or a reception.

1179
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:35,040
或許就坐在她身旁
Perhaps he might be seated next to her.

1180
01:27:35,124 --> 01:27:39,002
或許他們還有獨處的機會
Perhaps they might have another time alone, somewhere.

1181
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:42,381
但他不能沒有她的日子
But he could not live without seeing her.

♫ You loved me still the same ♫

1187
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:08,650
♫ 你愛著我 ♫
♫ That you loved me ♫

1188
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:22,210
♫ 你愛我依然 ♫
♫ You loved me still the same ♫

1189
01:28:26,092 --> 01:28:27,718
您就是阿切爾先生
Mr. Archer, I think.

1190
01:28:28,344 --> 01:28:29,386
正是
Yes.

1191
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:31,972
我姓裏維埃
My name is Riviere.

1192
01:28:32,056 --> 01:28:33,974
去年我們在巴黎曾一起吃飯
I dined with you in Paris last year.

1193
01:28:34,058 --> 01:28:36,727
對  抱歉  我一時沒想起來
Yes. I'm sorry. I didn't quite recall.

1194
01:28:36,811 --> 01:28:41,606
我昨天在波士頓看見你  所以一眼就認出你來
Quite all right. I had the advantage. I saw you in Boston yesterday.

1195
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:47,696
我奉奧蘭斯卡伯爵之命前來
I came here on Count Olenski's behalf.

1196
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:52,367
我相信她該回到丈夫身邊
Because I believed in all good faith that she should return to him.

1197
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:54,619
抱歉
Forgive me.

1198
01:28:54,704 --> 01:28:57,456
抱歉  先生
Forgive me, monsieur,

1199
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:01,001
我真的不明白
but I really don't understand your purpose

1200
01:29:01,085 --> 01:29:02,836
你為何來找我
in coming to see me.

1201
01:29:04,505 --> 01:29:06,465
她變了
She's changed, monsieur.

1202
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:09,384
您跟她是舊識嗎
You knew her before?

1203
01:29:10,136 --> 01:29:12,679
我常在伯爵家中見到她
I used to see her at her husband's house, yes.

1204
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:15,349
伯爵不會將此事托給陌生人
Well, the count would not have entrusted my mission to a stranger.

1205
01:29:15,433 --> 01:29:19,227
你提到她變了
This change that you mentioned.

1206
01:29:19,312 --> 01:29:23,440
這是我頭一遭見到她真情流露
It may only have been my seeing her for the first time,

1207
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:26,777
美國式的真情流露
as she is, as an American.

1208
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:29,404
她本有心做個賢妻良母
She made her marriage in good faith.

1209
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:33,533
但伯爵卻無法體會
It was a faith the Count could not share,

1210
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:35,410
難以理解
could not understand.

1211
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:39,206
所以  她的信念
So, her faith was...

1212
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:40,624
粉碎了
Detruit?

1213
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:44,211
- 破裂了  毀滅了  - 毀滅了
- Broken. Destroyed. - Destroyed.

1214
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:50,801
她回歐洲雖可過優裕的生活
Returning to Europe would mean a life of some comfort,

1215
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:54,513
但犧牲太大
and considerable sacrifice.

1216
01:29:54,597 --> 01:29:56,723
而且難以再續前緣
And, I would think, no hope.

1217
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:02,396
當然了  我會依約
I will, of course, fulfil my obligation to the Count,

1218
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,563
拜訪她的家人
and meet with the family.

1219
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:08,235
並轉達伯爵的意願
I will tell them everything that he suggests, and wishes for the Countess.

1220
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:12,155
但也希望你能動用你的影響力
But I would ask you to use your influence with them.

1221
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:17,452
求你叫她千萬別回頭
I beg you, monsieur. Do not let her go back.

1222
01:30:20,456 --> 01:30:23,083
巴克斯特·潘尼羅夫人死後
When old Mrs. Baxter Pennilow died,

1223
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:24,751
家人才發現
they found her standing order,

1224
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:28,922
她有四十八套大師做的女裝  仍原封不動
48 Worth dresses, still wrapped in tissue paper.

1225
01:30:29,006 --> 01:30:31,758
她的女兒守完孝之後
When her daughters left off their mourning,

1226
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:34,553
竟穿那些衣服去聽音樂會
they wore the first lot to the symphony

1227
01:30:34,637 --> 01:30:37,848
毫不在意流行的趨勢
without looking in advance of the fashion.

1228
01:30:38,641 --> 01:30:42,102
他曾在華盛頓寫信給她
He had written to her once in Washington,

1229
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:45,689
只是問她何時能再見面
just a few lines asking when they would meet again.

1230
01:30:47,024 --> 01:30:50,026
她回答  時機未到
And she wrote back, "Not yet."

1231
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:53,780
儘管風格已經改變
And even that had the front panel changed.

1232
01:30:53,865 --> 01:30:57,117
博弗特帶動了新流行
No, I think it was Julius Beaufort who started the new fashion.

1233
01:30:57,201 --> 01:31:01,121
回國時他讓太太穿新衣亮相
By making his wife clap her new clothes on her back as soon as they arrived.

1234
01:31:01,205 --> 01:31:05,459
幸好她身世顯赫  否則就像
I must say, it takes all Regina's distinction not to look like...

1235
01:31:05,543 --> 01:31:07,169
他在外面養的女人
Her rivals?

1236
01:31:07,253 --> 01:31:08,712
他的情婦安妮·瑞茵
Like that Annie Ring.

1237
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,422
留點口德
Careful, dear.

1238
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:12,257
這已經是公開的秘密
Everybody knows.

1239
01:31:12,341 --> 01:31:13,633
的確
Indeed.

1240
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:15,886
他總是亂投資
Beaufort always put his business around.

1241
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:19,347
現在生意垮了  他必須給大家一個交代
And now that his business is gone, there are bound to be disclosures.

1242
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:21,433
垮了  有那麼糟嗎
Gone? Is it really that bad?

1243
01:31:21,517 --> 01:31:24,102
簡直是一塌糊塗
As bad as anything I ever heard of.

1244
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:27,606
每個我們認識的人都會受到影響
Most everybody we know will be hit one way or another.

1245
01:31:32,111 --> 01:31:35,989
他太太當然是最大的受害者
Very difficult for Regina, of course. And, it's a pity.

1246
01:31:36,073 --> 01:31:39,910
奧蘭斯卡伯爵夫人回絕伯爵也是不智之舉
It's certainly a pity that Countess Olenska refused her husband's offer.

1247
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:42,496
何以見得
Why, for God's sake?

1248
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:44,164
以最基本的角度來看
Well, to put it on the lowest ground,

1249
01:31:44,248 --> 01:31:46,374
- 她現在靠什麼生活  - 生活
- what's she going to live on now? - Live on?

1250
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:47,918
如今博弗特
I mean, now that Beaufort...

1251
01:31:48,252 --> 01:31:50,712
你這是什麼意思
What the hell does that mean, sir?

1252
01:31:55,092 --> 01:31:58,220
她大部分的錢都交由博弗特投資
Most of her money's invested with Beaufort.

1253
01:31:58,304 --> 01:32:01,681
而且她娘家也不再資助她
And the allowance she's been getting from the family is so cut back.

1254
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:02,849
她應該還有錢
I'm sure she has something.

1255
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:04,351
一點錢
I would think a little.

1256
01:32:04,644 --> 01:32:07,604
還債之後也所剩無多了
Whatever remains after sustaining more debt.

1257
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:11,608
她娘家很在意裏維埃的話
I know the family paid close attention to Monsieur Riviere,

1258
01:32:11,692 --> 01:32:14,110
而且非常審慎地評估了伯爵的條件
and considered the Count's offer very carefully.

1259
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:16,196
如果大家都希望她成為博弗特的情婦
If everyone had rather she be Beaufort's mistress

1260
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:19,115
那麼你做得一點都沒錯
than some decent fellow's wife, you've all gone about it perfectly.

1261
01:32:21,619 --> 01:32:23,245
她是不會回去的
She won't go back.

1262
01:32:25,623 --> 01:32:27,624
那只是你個人的想法
That's your opinion, eh?

1263
01:32:28,918 --> 01:32:31,002
沒錯
Well, no doubt you know.

1264
01:32:33,589 --> 01:32:36,091
我想她大可求明戈特夫人
I suppose she might still soften Catherine Mingott,

1265
01:32:36,175 --> 01:32:38,301
給她一些生活費
who could give her any allowance she chooses,

1266
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:41,846
但其他家人都希望她回歐洲
but the rest of the family have no particular interest in keeping her here.

1267
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:44,391
他們會由她
They'll simply let her...

1268
01:32:44,475 --> 01:32:46,226
自生自滅
Find her own level.

1269
01:32:53,859 --> 01:32:55,318
晚上好  先生
Evening, sir.

1270
01:32:59,156 --> 01:33:00,824
謝謝  馬丁
Thank you, Martin.

1271
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:10,166
這盞燈又在冒煙  找傭人來修
That lamp is smoking again. The servant should see to it.

1272
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:11,585
對不起
I'm sorry.

1273
01:33:19,677 --> 01:33:22,554
我得去華盛頓幾天
I may have to go to Washington for a few days.

1274
01:33:22,638 --> 01:33:24,514
什麼時候
When?

1275
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:27,684
明天  抱歉  我早該訴你的
Tomorrow. I'm sorry. I should have said it before.

1276
01:33:28,603 --> 01:33:29,936
出差
On business?

1277
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:32,022
有一件專利案
On business, of course. There's a patent case

1278
01:33:32,106 --> 01:33:33,898
在最高法院開庭
coming up before the Supreme Court.

1279
01:33:33,983 --> 01:33:36,109
萊特布賴爾剛把此案交給我
I just got the papers from Letterblair.

1280
01:33:36,193 --> 01:33:37,277
看來他是有意
It seems that he intended...

1281
01:33:37,361 --> 01:33:40,155
算了  太複雜了
Never mind. It sounds too complicated.

1282
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:42,198
這盞燈就夠我煩的了
I have enough trouble managing this lamp.

1283
01:33:42,283 --> 01:33:44,451
讓我試試
Let me try that.

1284
01:33:44,535 --> 01:33:47,287
去別處走走也好
But the change will do you good.

1285
01:33:47,371 --> 01:33:50,206
你一定要去看看艾倫
And you must be sure to go and see Ellen.

1286
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:59,257
抱歉打擾  夫人  你的信
Excuse me, ma'am, but this came for you while you were out.

1287
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:03,136
你能拿去修一下嗎  愛麗絲
Do something about this, will you, Alice?

1288
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:04,721
遵命  先生
Certainly, sir.

1289
01:34:07,725 --> 01:34:09,601
奶奶中風了
Granny's had a stroke.

1290
01:34:12,063 --> 01:34:14,064
中風
A stroke?

1291
01:34:14,148 --> 01:34:16,066
豈有此理
Ridiculous.

1292
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:19,944
不過是感恩節多吃了點罷了
I told them all, it was just an excessive Thanksgiving.

1293
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:27,410
那個醫生不僅小題大作  還唯恐天下不知
Dr Bencomb acted most concerned and insisted on notifying everyone.

1294
01:34:27,495 --> 01:34:30,705
好像要大家來聽我的遺囑
As if it were the last reading of my will and testament.

1295
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:32,123
你們真乖  會來關心我
You're very dear to come.

1296
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:36,419
但或許只是來分遺產的
But perhaps you only wanted to see what I'd left you.

1297
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:38,088
奶奶  你真是胡言亂語
Granny, that's shocking!

1298
01:34:38,172 --> 01:34:40,799
是胡言亂語令我中風的
It was shock that did this to me.

1299
01:34:40,883 --> 01:34:44,219
不  謝了  這都要怪瑞吉娜·博弗特太太
No. Thank you. It's all due to Regina Beaufort.

1300
01:34:45,596 --> 01:34:49,432
她昨晚來找我  求我
She came here last night, and she asked me...

1301
01:34:50,309 --> 01:34:54,729
求我  虧她說得出口
She asked me... She had the effrontery

1302
01:34:54,814 --> 01:34:58,316
要我幫助博弗特
to ask me to back Julius.

1303
01:34:58,401 --> 01:35:01,361
她要我別見死不救
Not to desert him, she said.

1304
01:35:01,445 --> 01:35:05,824
幫他們湯森德家族度過難關
To stand behind our common lineage in the Townsend family.

1305
01:35:06,617 --> 01:35:10,453
幫助博弗特  就等於幫助他們全家族
If you back Julius, you can see the family through.

1306
01:35:11,747 --> 01:35:13,707
如果你見死不救
If you don't,

1307
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:15,917
我們就都會
we will all,

1308
01:35:16,001 --> 01:35:18,712
永遠抬不起頭來
every one of us, fall into dishonour.

1309
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:20,964
我告訴她
I said to her...

1310
01:35:21,048 --> 01:35:23,883
咱們明戈特家
Honour's always been honour.

1311
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:27,387
做事一向光明磊落
And honesty's always been honesty in Manson Mingott's house.

1312
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:31,516
只要我一息尚存  絕不做違背良心之事
And will be, till I'm carried out feet-first.

1313
01:35:32,643 --> 01:35:37,397
她回答說  如果你敢相信她所說的  但我的名譽怎麼辦  姑姑
And then she said, if you can believe this, "But my name, Auntie."

1314
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:39,941
我的名譽怎麼辦
But my name, Auntie.

1315
01:35:40,025 --> 01:35:42,235
我叫瑞吉娜·湯森德
My name's Regina Townsend.

1316
01:35:42,319 --> 01:35:43,403
於是我對她說
And I said to her...

1317
01:35:43,487 --> 01:35:47,073
你在博弗特娶你入門時  就已冠上夫姓
Your name was Beaufort when he covered you with jewels,

1318
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:51,327
既使現今他已使你蒙羞  你仍姓博弗特
and it's got to stay Beaufort, now that he's covered you with shame.

1319
01:35:53,914 --> 01:35:55,665
然後我就崩潰了
And then I gave out,

1320
01:35:57,168 --> 01:35:59,544
就這麼崩潰了
simply gave out.

1321
01:35:59,628 --> 01:36:02,589
現在大伙全等著參加我的葬禮
And now family is arriving from all over,

1322
01:36:02,673 --> 01:36:06,217
然後他們又需要有人招待
expecting a funeral, and they'll have to be entertained.

1323
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:09,012
真不知大夫通知了多少人
I don't know how many notes Bencomb sent out.

1324
01:36:09,096 --> 01:36:13,641
- 希望我們能幫得上忙  - 艾倫就快來了
- If there's anything we can do to help out... - Well, my Ellen is coming.

1325
01:36:13,726 --> 01:36:16,019
我指名要她來
I expressly asked for her.

1326
01:36:16,103 --> 01:36:19,230
她的火車今天到  如果你肯去接她的話
She arrives this afternoon on the train. If you could fetch her...

1327
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:23,026
當然  如果梅要用四輪馬車的話  我去乘輪渡
Of course. If May will send the brougham, I'll take the ferry.

1328
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:25,695
好  謝謝
Fine. Fine. Thank you.

1329
01:36:27,156 --> 01:36:30,158
瞧  這不就成了
There? You see, Granny? Everyone will be settled.

1330
01:36:30,367 --> 01:36:33,369
謝謝你  乖孫  願上天保佑你
Thank you, dear. Bless you.

1331
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:35,955
我不想讓奶奶操心
I didn't want to worry Granny,

1332
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:38,291
可是你今天要去華盛頓
but how can you meet Ellen and bring her back here

1333
01:36:38,375 --> 01:36:41,127
怎麼去接艾倫呢
if you have to go to Washington yourself this afternoon?

1334
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:44,047
我不去了  早上萊特布賴爾告訴我
I'm not going. The case is off, postponed.

1335
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:46,049
開庭延期了
I heard from Letterblair this morning.

1336
01:36:46,133 --> 01:36:48,384
延期  這怎麼可能
Postponed? How odd.

1337
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:51,513
早上我媽也收到他的通知
Mama had a note from him this morning as well.

1338
01:36:51,597 --> 01:36:55,141
他也很關心奶奶  但無法前來
He was concerned about Granny, but had to be away.

1339
01:36:55,226 --> 01:36:58,311
他正在最高法院打一場專利官司
He was arguing a big patent case before the Supreme Court.

1340
01:36:58,395 --> 01:37:00,230
一場專利的官司
You did say it was a patent case, didn't you?

1341
01:37:00,314 --> 01:37:02,023
大家都無法出庭
Well, that's it. The whole office can't go.

1342
01:37:02,107 --> 01:37:04,317
萊特布賴爾只好自己去了
Letterblair decided to go himself.

1343
01:37:04,401 --> 01:37:07,195
這不叫延期
So then, it's not postponed?

1344
01:37:07,279 --> 01:37:09,239
對  可是我出庭的日期是延了
No, but my going is.

1345
01:37:18,499 --> 01:37:20,667
他計算過搭車和乘船
He knew it was two hours by ferry

1346
01:37:20,751 --> 01:37:25,672
從紐澤西市賓州車站到明戈特奶奶家
and carriage from the Pennsylvania terminus in Jersey City back to Mrs. Mingott's.

1347
01:37:28,342 --> 01:37:30,385
需要兩小時
All of two hours.

1348
01:37:30,469 --> 01:37:32,428
或許多一點
And maybe a little more.

1349
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:38,101
- 沒想到我會來吧  - 對
- You didn't expect me today. - No.

1350
01:37:38,185 --> 01:37:41,646
我差點去華盛頓找你  我們差點見不到面
I nearly came to Washington to see you. We would have missed each other.

1351
01:37:41,730 --> 01:37:45,108
明戈特奶奶要我來接你  她好多了
It was Granny Mingott who sent me. She's much better.

1352
01:37:56,662 --> 01:37:59,205
我幾乎把你給忘了
You know, I hardly remembered you.

1353
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:00,373
幾乎把我給忘了
Hardly remembered?

1354
01:38:00,457 --> 01:38:03,835
每次都是如此
I mean... I mean, each time is the same.

1355
01:38:05,629 --> 01:38:07,964
每回你都給帶我全新的感受
You happen to me all over again.

1356
01:38:09,216 --> 01:38:11,050
我知道
Yes, I know.

1357
01:38:11,135 --> 01:38:12,677
我也有相同的感受
For me, too.

1358
01:39:05,564 --> 01:39:08,399
我們不能再這樣耗下去了
Ellen, we can't stay like this. It can't last.

1359
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:11,945
我們必須面對現實
I think we should look at reality, not dreams.

1360
01:39:12,029 --> 01:39:13,738
我要跟你長相廝守
I just want us to be together.

1361
01:39:13,822 --> 01:39:15,156
我不可能嫁給你的
I can't be your wife, Newland.

1362
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:17,575
難道要我當你情婦嗎
Is it your idea I should live with you as your mistress?

1363
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:19,035
我想
I want...

1364
01:39:19,703 --> 01:39:22,330
我想要帶你遠走高飛
Somehow I want to get away with you,

1365
01:39:22,414 --> 01:39:25,041
到一個沒有妻妾之分的地方
and find a world where words like that don't exist.

1366
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:26,834
噢  親愛的
Oh, my dear.

1367
01:39:29,213 --> 01:39:32,298
什麼地方  你去過嗎
Where is that country? Have you ever been there?

1368
01:39:34,218 --> 01:39:37,971
到哪兒可以逃過良心的譴責呢
Is there anywhere we can be happy behind the backs of people who trust us?

1369
01:39:38,055 --> 01:39:39,430
我不在乎
I'm beyond caring about that.

1370
01:39:39,515 --> 01:39:41,766
你不是這種人
No, you're not.

1371
01:39:41,850 --> 01:39:44,060
你從未離經叛道過
You've never been beyond that.

1372
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:46,229
而我卻是過來人
I have.

1373
01:39:48,148 --> 01:39:51,317
我瞭解那種感受  我們是不可能結合的
I know what it looks like. It's no place for us.

1374
01:40:03,372 --> 01:40:07,041
為何停車  奶奶不住這裏
Why are... Why are we stopping? This isn't Granny's.

1375
01:40:07,126 --> 01:40:09,002
我要在這兒下車
No. I'll get out here.

1376
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:17,051
你說得對  我不該來的
You were right. I shouldn't have come today.

1377
01:40:58,385 --> 01:40:59,969
你在看什麼
What are you reading?

1378
01:41:02,806 --> 01:41:04,766
一本有關日本的書
It's a book about Japan.

1379
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:07,602
為何讀它
Why?

1380
01:41:09,354 --> 01:41:11,647
我也不知道
I don't know.

1381
01:41:11,732 --> 01:41:14,150
因為那是不同的國家
Because it's a different country.

1382
01:41:15,319 --> 01:41:17,528
你不是愛讀詩嗎
You used to read poetry.

1383
01:41:17,613 --> 01:41:20,239
我喜歡你念詩給我聽
It was so nice when you read it to me.

1384
01:41:33,045 --> 01:41:34,337
紐倫德
Newland.

1385
01:41:34,588 --> 01:41:36,339
你會感冒的
You'll catch your death.

1386
01:41:42,846 --> 01:41:44,180
當然
Of course.

1387
01:41:45,682 --> 01:41:48,559
他發現他已有如行屍走肉
But then he realised, "I am dead.

1388
01:41:49,061 --> 01:41:52,438
死了好幾個月
"I've been dead for months and months."

1389
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:55,358
他突然想到她可以死掉
Then it occurred to him that she might die.

1390
01:41:56,193 --> 01:41:59,612
世事難料  健康的年輕人也可能遭遇不測
People did. Young people, healthy people did.

1391
01:42:00,364 --> 01:42:03,407
也許她會死  讓他恢復自由
She might die and set him free.

1392
01:42:09,081 --> 01:42:10,289
紐倫德
Newland?

1393
01:42:25,472 --> 01:42:27,431
艾倫  我非見你不可
Ellen, I have to see you.

1394
01:42:29,601 --> 01:42:31,602
你何時離開
I didn't know when you were leaving again.

1395
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:32,979
我不走了
I'm... I'm not leaving.

1396
01:42:33,063 --> 01:42:35,439
奶奶要我留下來照顧她
Granny's asked me to stay and take care of her.

1397
01:42:35,524 --> 01:42:37,316
那麼我們得好好談談
Then we have to talk now.

1398
01:42:37,401 --> 01:42:40,444
我得到瑞吉娜家去  坐奶奶的車去
I'm due at Regina Beaufort's. Granny lent me her carriage.

1399
01:42:40,529 --> 01:42:43,030
奶奶說博弗特是個無賴  我先生也一樣
I know Granny says Julius Beaufort is a scoundrel,

1400
01:42:43,115 --> 01:42:46,659
而全家族的人卻都要我回到他身旁
but so is my husband, and the family still want me to go back to him.

1401
01:42:46,743 --> 01:42:51,164
只有奶奶是個明理之人  她甚至時常接濟我
Only Granny understands. She's even seen to my allowance.

1402
01:42:51,623 --> 01:42:53,708
我必須找個地方和你獨處
I have to see you, somewhere we can be alone.

1403
01:42:53,792 --> 01:42:56,252
- 在紐約嗎  - 只要是能獨處的地方
- In New York? - Alone. Somewhere we can be alone.

1404
01:42:56,336 --> 01:42:59,338
明天下午兩點半美術館見
The art museum in the park, 2:30 tomorrow.

1405
01:42:59,423 --> 01:43:01,215
我在門口等你
I'll be at the door.

1406
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:06,200
{\an8}用途不詳

1407
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:13,519
你到紐約來只因你怕
You came to New York because you were afraid.

1408
01:43:13,604 --> 01:43:15,688
- 怕什麼  - 怕我去華盛頓找你
- Afraid? - Of my coming to Washington.

1409
01:43:15,772 --> 01:43:17,982
我以為在紐約會比較安全
I thought I would be safer.

1410
01:43:18,066 --> 01:43:19,567
怕我打擾你
Safer from me?

1411
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:24,947
艾倫
Ellen?

1412
01:43:28,785 --> 01:43:29,785
怕
S...

1413
01:43:31,830 --> 01:43:33,748
怕自己陷得太深嗎
Safer from loving me?

1414
01:43:41,423 --> 01:43:44,300
可以給你一次然後回家去嗎
Shall I come to you once and then go home?

1415
01:43:55,354 --> 01:43:57,146
給我一次吧
Come to me once then.

1416
01:44:02,986 --> 01:44:04,070
什麼時候
When?

1417
01:44:07,741 --> 01:44:09,075
明天
Tomorrow.

1418
01:44:16,166 --> 01:44:17,667
後天吧
The day after.

1419
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:28,100
{\an8}奧蘭斯卡夫人  第五大道  八零九號

1420
01:44:48,949 --> 01:44:52,868
抱歉  我回來晚了  沒讓你操心吧
I'm sorry I'm late. You weren't worried, were you?

1421
01:44:53,787 --> 01:44:55,162
現在很晚嗎
Is it late?

1422
01:44:55,247 --> 01:44:56,789
已經七點多了
It's past 7:00.

1423
01:44:56,873 --> 01:44:59,834
我和艾倫在奶奶家聊
I stayed at Granny's because Cousin Ellen came in.

1424
01:44:59,918 --> 01:45:04,714
她非常友好  我們聊得很開心  就像是從前的她
We had a wonderful talk. She was so dear, just like the old Ellen.

1425
01:45:04,798 --> 01:45:07,591
奶奶好喜歡她
Granny was so charmed by her.

1426
01:45:07,676 --> 01:45:11,012
不過她有時真讓人反感
But you can see, though, how the family's been annoyed with her at times.

1427
01:45:11,138 --> 01:45:14,056
例如坐奶奶的車去看博弗特太太
Going to see Regina Beaufort in Granny's carriage and...

1428
01:45:14,141 --> 01:45:16,183
今晚要出去吃嗎
Are we dining out tonight?

1429
01:45:20,355 --> 01:45:22,481
你今天還沒親我
You haven't kissed me today.

1430
01:45:38,540 --> 01:45:41,208
當時紐約人的習慣
It was the custom in old New York

1431
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:43,794
新婚的前幾年
for brides to appear in their wedding dress

1432
01:45:43,879 --> 01:45:46,922
新嫁娘都穿著結婚禮服出門
during the first year or two of marriage.

1433
01:45:47,007 --> 01:45:49,342
但梅從歐洲回來後
But May, since returning from Europe,

1434
01:45:49,426 --> 01:45:52,678
今晚是她第一次穿上結婚禮服
had not worn her bridal satin until this evening.

1435
01:46:35,889 --> 01:46:38,808
抱歉  梅  我的頭好痛
May, I'm sorry. My head's bursting.

1436
01:46:38,892 --> 01:46:41,977
別告訴任何人  我們回家吧
Please don't tell anyone. Come home with me now.

1437
01:46:55,075 --> 01:46:56,826
你不是該休息
Shouldn't you rest?

1438
01:46:58,245 --> 01:47:01,080
我的頭好多了
My head's not as bad as that.

1439
01:47:01,164 --> 01:47:05,167
有件事我得告訴你
And there's something important I have to say to you right away.

1440
01:47:26,815 --> 01:47:30,025
我得和你談談
May, there is something that I've got to tell you.

1441
01:47:31,695 --> 01:47:33,362
關於我自己
About myself.

1442
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,535
奧蘭斯卡夫人
Madame Olenska...

1443
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:42,204
為何要在今晚談她
Why should we talk about Ellen tonight?

1444
01:47:44,708 --> 01:47:47,209
因為我早就該說了
Because I should have spoken before and...

1445
01:47:47,294 --> 01:47:48,919
真有那麼重要嗎
Is it really worthwhile, dear?

1446
01:47:49,337 --> 01:47:52,131
我知道有時我對她過於冷淡
I know I've been unfair to her at times.

1447
01:47:52,215 --> 01:47:54,300
或許你也一樣
Perhaps we all have.

1448
01:47:54,384 --> 01:47:56,719
你是最瞭解她的人
You've understood her better than any of us, I suppose,

1449
01:47:56,803 --> 01:47:59,722
但現已經事過境遷了
but does it really matter now that it's all over?

1450
01:48:01,766 --> 01:48:03,476
事過境遷  什麼意思
How do you mean, "over"?

1451
01:48:04,352 --> 01:48:07,563
她馬上就要回歐洲了
Why, since she's going back to Europe so soon.

1452
01:48:08,356 --> 01:48:10,483
儘管奶奶很失望  但她能體諒
Granny's approved, and understands.

1453
01:48:10,567 --> 01:48:11,901
她願意給她一筆錢
She's disappointed, of course,

1454
01:48:11,985 --> 01:48:16,238
讓她不用再仰賴伯爵
but she's arranged to make Ellen financially independent of the Count.

1455
01:48:16,323 --> 01:48:19,617
我以為你今天在辦公室聽說了
I... I thought you would have heard today at your offices.

1456
01:48:33,215 --> 01:48:35,674
- 不可能  - 不可能
- It's impossible. - Impossible?

1457
01:48:35,759 --> 01:48:38,385
她本可以住在紐約
Certainly she could have stayed here with Granny's extra money,

1458
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:41,263
只是她不要
but I guess she's given us up, after all.

1459
01:48:42,432 --> 01:48:44,225
你怎麼會知道
How do you know that?

1460
01:48:45,685 --> 01:48:49,647
艾倫親口說的  我說過我昨天在奶奶家遇見她
From Ellen. I told you, I saw her at Granny's yesterday.

1461
01:48:49,731 --> 01:48:51,941
她昨天告訴你的
And she told you that, yesterday?

1462
01:48:53,902 --> 01:48:57,446
不是  今天下午我收到她的來信
No. She sent me a note this afternoon.

1463
01:49:02,452 --> 01:49:04,286
想看嗎
Do you want to see it?

1464
01:49:13,672 --> 01:49:14,964
我以為你已經知道了
I thought you knew.

1465
01:49:30,021 --> 01:49:33,732
親愛的梅  我終於讓奶奶瞭解
"May, dear, I have at last made Granny understand

1466
01:49:33,817 --> 01:49:37,403
我這次來  只是想看看她
"that my visit to her could be no more than a visit,

1467
01:49:37,487 --> 01:49:39,780
這一回她和以前一樣疼我
"and she has been as kind and generous as ever."

1468
01:49:39,864 --> 01:49:43,284
這一回她和以前一樣疼我
"And she has been as kind and generous as ever.

1469
01:49:43,368 --> 01:49:47,705
她知道我回歐洲後  必須自食其力
"She sees now that if I return to Europe, I must live by myself.

1470
01:49:47,789 --> 01:49:52,418
我急於回華盛頓打包  下周就搭船回歐洲
"I am hurrying back to Washington to pack up, and I sail next week.

1471
01:49:52,502 --> 01:49:55,504
我不在時要好好照顧她
"You be must very good to Granny when I'm gone,

1472
01:49:55,589 --> 01:49:58,173
就像你待我那樣
"as good as you've always been to me.

1473
01:49:59,259 --> 01:50:02,011
萬一有人想說服我留下來
"If any of my friends wish to urge me to change my mind,

1474
01:50:02,095 --> 01:50:03,887
請他們別白費唇舌
"please tell them it would be utterly useless."

1475
01:50:03,972 --> 01:50:06,849
請他們別白費唇舌
"... tell them it would be utterly useless."

1476
01:50:17,736 --> 01:50:19,653
她為何寫這封信給你
Why did she write this?

1477
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:24,908
大概是我們昨天聊了很多吧
I suppose because we talked things over yesterday.

1478
01:50:25,952 --> 01:50:27,453
聊什麼
What things?

1479
01:50:27,537 --> 01:50:31,957
我說我怕自己待她不夠好
I told her that I was afraid I hadn't always been fair to her,

1480
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:36,795
因為我不瞭解她所受的苦
that I hadn't always understood how hard it must have been for her here.

1481
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,000
我知道她很信任你
I knew you'd be the one friend she could always count on,

1482
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:43,469
我要她知道  我跟你一樣支持她
and I wanted her to know that you and I were the same in all of our feelings.

1483
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:48,766
她瞭解我為何說這一番話
She understood why I wanted to tell her this.

1484
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:51,352
她是個善解人意的人
I think she understands everything.

1485
01:51:02,614 --> 01:51:04,281
我的頭也好痛
My head aches too.

1486
01:51:07,410 --> 01:51:09,620
- 晚安  親愛的  - 晚安
- Good night, dear. - Good night.

1487
01:51:28,014 --> 01:51:30,849
誠如阿切爾的母親所說
It was, as Mrs. Archer said to Mrs. Welland,

1488
01:51:30,934 --> 01:51:34,061
新婚夫婦首次請客是件大事
a great event for a young couple to give their first dinner,

1489
01:51:34,145 --> 01:51:37,189
必須做到盡善盡美
and it was not to be undertaken lightly.

1490
01:51:37,273 --> 01:51:38,691
要請個大廚
There was a hired chef,

1491
01:51:38,775 --> 01:51:41,860
兩個上菜的  用最上等的玫瑰
two borrowed footmen, roses from Henderson's,

1492
01:51:41,945 --> 01:51:45,906
檸檬汁甜酒  鑲金邊的菜單
Roman punch and menus on gilt-edged cards.

1493
01:51:45,990 --> 01:51:49,660
馮·德·萊登夫婦不僅出席了
It was considered a particular triumph that the van der Luydens,

1494
01:51:49,744 --> 01:51:53,330
還因梅之邀  留在紐約
at May's request, stayed in the city to be present

1495
01:51:53,415 --> 01:51:57,543
參加奧蘭斯卡伯爵夫人的送別會
at her farewell dinner for the Countess Olenska.

1496
01:51:57,627 --> 01:52:00,713
受辱後你必須離開紐約
You have to leave New York after the disgrace...

1497
01:52:00,797 --> 01:52:03,799
阿切爾將一桌慈面善目的人
Archer saw all the harmless-looking people

1498
01:52:03,883 --> 01:52:07,261
視為一群沉默的共謀者
at the table as a band of quiet conspirators,

1499
01:52:08,138 --> 01:52:11,598
破壞著他和艾倫的好事
with himself and Ellen the centre of their conspiracy.

1500
01:52:13,727 --> 01:52:16,353
他猜想著這幾個月來
He guessed himself to have been for months the centre

1501
01:52:16,438 --> 01:52:19,565
大家都默默盯著
of countless silently observing eyes

1502
01:52:19,649 --> 01:52:22,151
豎起耳朵靜靜地聽
and patiently listening ears.

1503
01:52:24,404 --> 01:52:27,781
他體會到他們成功地
He understood that somehow the separation

1504
01:52:27,866 --> 01:52:31,785
把他和他情人分開了
between himself and the partner of his guilt had been achieved.

1505
01:52:33,204 --> 01:52:37,666
他也瞭解到大夥兒都站在梅那一邊
And he knew that now the whole tribe had rallied around his wife.

1506
01:52:39,669 --> 01:52:43,589
他成了眾矢之的
He was a prisoner in the centre of an armed camp.

1507
01:52:44,382 --> 01:52:46,216
我在想他們是否會回來
I wonder if they'll ever get it back.

1508
01:52:46,301 --> 01:52:47,676
博弗特太太病了
Regina's not well at all,

1509
01:52:47,761 --> 01:52:50,512
但博弗特仍然
but that doesn't stop Beaufort from devoting as much time

1510
01:52:50,597 --> 01:52:52,264
常和安妮·瑞茵廝混
to Annie Ring as he can manage.

1511
01:52:52,348 --> 01:52:53,807
老實說
The best thing Beaufort could do

1512
01:52:53,892 --> 01:52:57,770
博弗特應該去北卡找她
would be to go and stay at Regina's little place in North Carolina.

1513
01:52:57,854 --> 01:52:59,855
他可以在那兒養馬
He could breed trotters...

1514
01:52:59,939 --> 01:53:01,607
他寄給艾倫的鑰匙
And the key to his release

1515
01:53:01,691 --> 01:53:04,568
當天即被返還
had been returned the day before.

1516
01:53:04,652 --> 01:53:07,070
被原封不動寄了回來
By mail. Unopened.

1517
01:53:08,865 --> 01:53:12,659
博弗特根本不擔心婚外情曝光
He may stay here as a deliberate challenge to the outrage he's created.

1518
01:53:12,744 --> 01:53:14,828
說不定他還會競選總統呢
Perhaps he'll run for public office.

1519
01:53:14,913 --> 01:53:18,081
安妮·瑞茵會成為他的第一夫人嗎
Then will Annie Ring be his first lady?

1520
01:53:20,794 --> 01:53:22,961
從華盛頓回來累嗎
Was your trip from Washington very tiring?

1521
01:53:25,256 --> 01:53:28,050
火車上悶得要命
The heat on the train was dreadful.

1522
01:53:29,552 --> 01:53:31,845
出遠門總是辛苦的
But all travel has its hardships.

1523
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:35,766
能換個環境就值得了
Well, whatever they may be, they're worth it just to get away.

1524
01:53:36,935 --> 01:53:39,394
我也打算出遠門
I mean to do a lot of travelling myself soon.

1525
01:53:45,401 --> 01:53:47,986
菲利普  一起去冒險吧
What about you, Philip? What about a little adventure?

1526
01:53:48,071 --> 01:53:51,698
雅典或是伊斯麥  或是君士坦丁堡
Athens and Smyrna, maybe even Constantinople.

1527
01:53:51,783 --> 01:53:52,991
或許吧  或許吧
Possibly. Possibly.

1528
01:53:53,076 --> 01:53:54,993
千萬別去拿坡裏
But not Naples.

1529
01:53:55,078 --> 01:53:57,496
大夫說那兒有流行病
Dr Bencomb says there's a fever.

1530
01:53:58,373 --> 01:54:01,083
噢  真的嗎  拿坡裏有流行病
Oh, really? A fever in Naples.

1531
01:54:02,752 --> 01:54:04,503
那麼我就去印度吧
Well, there's always India, of course.

1532
01:54:04,587 --> 01:54:06,338
在印度至少得待三周才夠
You must have three weeks to do India properly.

1533
01:54:06,422 --> 01:54:07,798
沒錯
Absolutely.

1534
01:54:10,593 --> 01:54:13,011
博弗特雖然未受邀
Beaufort may not receive invitations any more,

1535
01:54:13,096 --> 01:54:15,848
但仍然保持高姿態
but it's clear he still maintains a certain position.

1536
01:54:15,932 --> 01:54:17,391
聽說是平躺在床上的姿態
Horizontal from all I've heard.

1537
01:54:17,475 --> 01:54:19,935
如果他再胡搞下去
If things go on like this, we'll be seeing our children

1538
01:54:20,019 --> 01:54:24,523
恐怕我們的後代會跟他的私生子結婚
fighting for invitations to swindlers' houses and marrying Beaufort's bastards.

1539
01:54:24,607 --> 01:54:26,149
他在外面生了幾個
Has he got any?

1540
01:54:26,234 --> 01:54:29,653
各位  留點口德
Be careful there, gentlemen. Draw it mild. Draw it mild.

1541
01:54:29,737 --> 01:54:34,032
社會對蕩婦總能容忍
Society has a history of tolerating vulgar women after all.

1542
01:54:34,117 --> 01:54:35,826
在某種程度上
Up to a point.

1543
01:54:35,910 --> 01:54:37,369
容忍那種人的唯一原因
But once it tolerates a man of that kind,

1544
01:54:37,453 --> 01:54:40,497
- 只能是為了繼承權  - 你是否注意到了
- the only prospect is total disinheritance... - Have you ever noticed

1545
01:54:40,582 --> 01:54:43,750
廚子最差的人家
it's the people with the worst cooks who are always yelling

1546
01:54:43,835 --> 01:54:47,546
總是嫌別人家的菜難吃
about being poisoned when they dine out?

1547
01:54:47,630 --> 01:54:51,675
我以為萊弗茨是精於此項
Lefferts used to be a little more adept, I thought.

1548
01:54:51,759 --> 01:54:55,178
但只要懂得步法
But then grace is not always required

1549
01:54:55,263 --> 01:54:57,556
這一門是不需美態的
as long as one knows the steps.

1550
01:55:05,857 --> 01:55:09,276
真不知萊弗茨這傢伙
I've never heard Lefferts so abound in the sentiments

1551
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:11,445
幾時成了衛道人士
that adorn Christian manhood.

1552
01:55:11,529 --> 01:55:13,614
憤怒和恐懼所爆發出的威力一樣傷人
Indignation lends a scathing eloquence.

1553
01:55:13,698 --> 01:55:18,535
家裏的壓力無窮無盡
It's almost as effective as fear. The pressure at home must be unrelenting.

1554
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:21,163
我從未聽過如此讚美家庭的話
I never expected to hear such a paean to the sanctity...

1555
01:55:21,247 --> 01:55:25,751
我母親想把她那尊維納斯銅像送給我們
My mother had a bronze reduction of the Venus De Milo she wanted to give us...

1556
01:55:25,835 --> 01:55:27,794
他們不動聲色地
The silent organisation

1557
01:55:27,879 --> 01:55:33,342
團結起來  決定痛懲不守規範的人
which held this whole small world together was determined to put itself on record.

1558
01:55:34,844 --> 01:55:39,681
從未有人質疑  奧蘭斯卡夫人的行為有違禮教
It had never for a moment questioned the propriety of Madame Olenska's conduct.

1559
01:55:40,475 --> 01:55:43,477
也從未有人質疑紐倫德的忠誠
It had never questioned Archer's fidelity.

1560
01:55:45,396 --> 01:55:49,942
從未有人聽說  懷疑  或甚至相信
And it had never heard of, suspected or even conceived possible

1561
01:55:50,026 --> 01:55:51,944
他們有任何不軌
anything at all to the contrary.

1562
01:55:52,028 --> 01:55:53,195
艾倫
Ellen.

1563
01:55:54,989 --> 01:55:57,908
從這一頓完美演出的飯局
From the seamless performance of this ritual,

1564
01:55:57,992 --> 01:56:02,412
阿切爾知道  紐約全城都認定他和奧蘭斯卡夫人是情人
Archer knew that New York believed him to be Madame Olenska's lover.

1565
01:56:02,497 --> 01:56:04,706
我們在聊舞會的事
We were discussing the Martha Washington ball.

1566
01:56:04,791 --> 01:56:07,960
我們想在復活節當周辦個愛盲舞會
Yes, we have it during Easter week to benefit the blind society.

1567
01:56:08,044 --> 01:56:09,169
他們做的工作棒極了
They do excellent work.

1568
01:56:09,253 --> 01:56:11,630
勞倫斯
Lawrence. Lawrence...

1569
01:56:11,714 --> 01:56:14,549
他第一次瞭解到
And he understood for the first time

1570
01:56:14,634 --> 01:56:16,969
自己的太太也這麼認為
that his wife shared the belief.

1571
01:56:26,938 --> 01:56:29,231
你一定要來歐洲看我
You must come visit me when you do.

1572
01:56:29,315 --> 01:56:33,110
等一切安頓好  我會寫信回來的
I'll write you as soon as I'm settled and let you know where I am.

1573
01:56:33,194 --> 01:56:34,987
那太好了
Yes, that would be lovely.

1574
01:56:35,071 --> 01:56:36,905
我送你上馬車
Shall I see you to your carriage?

1575
01:56:38,199 --> 01:56:40,283
我們正要送她回家
We are driving dear Ellen home.

1576
01:56:42,036 --> 01:56:43,245
再見
Good-bye.

1577
01:56:44,372 --> 01:56:47,499
再見  巴黎見了
Good-bye. And I'll see you very soon in Paris.

1578
01:56:47,959 --> 01:56:50,585
噢  希望你和梅能來
Oh, if you and May could come.

1579
01:56:52,088 --> 01:56:55,173
可以走了嗎
Shall we make our way to the carriage, my dear?

1580
01:57:06,769 --> 01:57:08,311
今晚真開心
Delightful evening, Newland.

1581
01:57:08,396 --> 01:57:09,980
晚安  紐倫德
Good night, Newland.

1582
01:57:10,064 --> 01:57:12,858
晚安  西勒頓  拉瑞
Good night, Sillerton. Good night, Larry.

1583
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:39,676
今夜的晚宴很棒吧
It did go off beautifully, didn't it?

1584
01:57:39,761 --> 01:57:40,969
噢  對
Oh, yes.

1585
01:57:43,306 --> 01:57:44,973
我能進來聊聊嗎
May I come in and talk it over?

1586
01:57:45,308 --> 01:57:48,685
當然  可是你一定很想睡了
Of course. But you must be very sleepy.

1587
01:57:48,770 --> 01:57:51,938
- 不  我想和你聊聊  - 好
- No, I'm not. I'd like to be with you a little. - Fine.

1588
01:58:11,167 --> 01:58:13,251
如果你願意
If you feel up to it, May,

1589
01:58:14,837 --> 01:58:18,298
我想告訴你一件事
there is something that I've been wanting to talk to you about.

1590
01:58:18,382 --> 01:58:21,593
那一夜就想告訴你的那件事
And I tried to talk to you the other evening.

1591
01:58:22,470 --> 01:58:24,096
是的  有關你自己的事
Yes, dear. Something about yourself.

1592
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:25,847
對  有關我自己的事
About myself, yes.

1593
01:58:27,350 --> 01:58:30,936
真不知該從何說起
It's so difficult to find the right words.

1594
01:58:31,020 --> 01:58:35,440
我覺得好累
But it's just that I feel so terribly tired at the moment.

1595
01:58:37,610 --> 01:58:39,111
我想
And I think...

1596
01:58:40,196 --> 01:58:42,197
而且每況愈下
Each day a little more so.

1597
01:58:43,741 --> 01:58:48,036
我想如果我休息一陣子  或許對大家都有好處
And I think it would be better for everyone if I were to make a break.

1598
01:58:49,872 --> 01:58:51,915
你是指辭職
You mean give up the law?

1599
01:58:55,336 --> 01:58:59,965
辭職當然也是一部分
Well, certainly that would be a part of it. And also just to...

1600
01:59:00,049 --> 01:59:01,299
然後出國
Just to get away.

1601
01:59:01,384 --> 01:59:03,802
我想出去旅行
I... I'd like to do some travelling.

1602
01:59:08,558 --> 01:59:10,058
歐洲
To Europe or...

1603
01:59:11,811 --> 01:59:13,603
或是更遠的地方
Perhaps even farther.

1604
01:59:16,023 --> 01:59:17,232
多遠
How far?

1605
01:59:18,234 --> 01:59:20,277
我也不知道
I don't know. I thought...

1606
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:22,988
印度或是日本吧
India or Japan.

1607
01:59:26,951 --> 01:59:28,493
像那麼遠的地方
As far as that?

1608
01:59:34,417 --> 01:59:35,625
這個嘛
Well...

1609
01:59:39,797 --> 01:59:41,923
恐怕你不能去  親愛的
I'm afraid you can't, dear.

1610
01:59:44,051 --> 01:59:46,386
除非你帶我去
Not unless you take me with you.

1611
01:59:50,141 --> 01:59:54,227
只怕醫生不會同意
That is, if the doctors will let me go, and I'm afraid they won't.

1612
01:59:58,024 --> 02:00:02,569
紐倫德  早上才確定的
Newland, I've been sure of something since this morning,

1613
02:00:02,653 --> 02:00:05,113
我一直想找機會告訴你
and I've been longing to tell you.

1614
02:00:20,379 --> 02:00:21,796
噢  親愛的
Oh, my dear.

1615
02:00:21,881 --> 02:00:23,506
意外吧
You didn't guess?

1616
02:00:25,092 --> 02:00:28,762
對  我希望  但
No. I mean, of course, I... I hoped, but...

1617
02:00:39,607 --> 02:00:41,650
你還告訴了誰
Have you told anyone else?

1618
02:00:43,653 --> 02:00:46,655
只有我媽媽和你母親
Only Mamma and your mother...

1619
02:00:46,739 --> 02:00:48,073
還有艾倫
And Ellen.

1620
02:00:51,619 --> 02:00:56,206
我說過我們聊了很久  而且她人很好
I told you we had a long talk one afternoon and how wonderful she was to me.

1621
02:01:04,882 --> 02:01:07,509
你不想讓她知道嗎
Did you mind my telling her, Newland?

1622
02:01:08,928 --> 02:01:11,054
怎麼會呢
Mind? Why should I?

1623
02:01:11,138 --> 02:01:13,807
那已經是兩星期前的事了吧
But that was two weeks ago, wasn't it?

1624
02:01:16,102 --> 02:01:19,396
你不是今天才確定的嗎
I thought you just said you weren't sure till today?

1625
02:01:21,274 --> 02:01:24,234
當時我是不確定
No, I... I wasn't sure then,

1626
02:01:24,318 --> 02:01:26,736
但我還是告訴她了
but I told her I was.

1627
02:01:30,533 --> 02:01:34,202
而且呢  我猜對了
And you see, I was right.

1628
02:01:52,638 --> 02:01:54,973
就在這書房
It was the room

1629
02:01:55,057 --> 02:01:59,728
他生命中最真實的事發生了
in which most of the real things of his life had happened.

1630
02:02:09,447 --> 02:02:11,573
他們的長子西奧多
Their eldest boy, Theodore,

1631
02:02:11,657 --> 02:02:15,160
無法在隆冬抱出門
too delicate to be taken to church in midwinter,

1632
02:02:15,244 --> 02:02:17,162
因此就在這兒受洗
had been christened there.

1633
02:02:17,246 --> 02:02:21,583
我以聖父
I baptise thee in the name of the Father,

1634
02:02:21,667 --> 02:02:23,668
聖子
and of the son,

1635
02:02:23,753 --> 02:02:25,545
以及聖靈的名義  為你施洗禮
and of the holy spirit.

1636
02:02:35,806 --> 02:02:38,641
泰德就在這裏學走路
It was here that Ted took his first steps.

1637
02:02:40,144 --> 02:02:43,563
紐倫德夫婦也常在此
And it was here that Archer and his wife always discussed

1638
02:02:43,647 --> 02:02:46,107
討論子女的未來
the future of all their children.

1639
02:02:46,650 --> 02:02:49,277
比爾對考古有興趣
Bill's interest in archaeology,

1640
02:02:49,362 --> 02:02:53,281
瑪麗喜歡體育和慈善活動
Mary's passion for sports and philanthropy,

1641
02:02:53,366 --> 02:02:58,495
熱愛藝術的泰德想當建築師
Ted's inclination toward art that led to a job with an architect,

1642
02:02:58,579 --> 02:03:01,456
和從事室內裝潢的工作
as well as some considerable redecoration.

1643
02:03:03,793 --> 02:03:07,379
瑪麗在這裏宣佈喜訊
It was in this room that Mary had announced her engagement...

1644
02:03:07,463 --> 02:03:09,214
我真為你開心
I'm so happy for you.

1645
02:03:09,298 --> 02:03:13,968
她嫁給了拉瑞·萊弗茨的兒子
To the dullest and most reliable of Larry Lefferts' many sons.

1646
02:03:21,644 --> 02:03:24,813
紐倫德也在這裏親吻了她
And it was in this room, too, that her father had kissed her

1647
02:03:24,897 --> 02:03:29,025
然後坐車陪她上教堂結婚
through her wedding veil before they motored to Grace Church.

1648
02:03:38,035 --> 02:03:41,746
紐倫德是個賢夫慈父
He was a dutiful and loving father, and a faithful husband.

1649
02:03:43,499 --> 02:03:48,336
當梅因照顧比爾而感染肺炎過世
When May died of infectious pneumonia after nursing Bill safely through,

1650
02:03:48,421 --> 02:03:50,880
他深深哀悼
he had honestly mourned her.

1651
02:03:50,965 --> 02:03:53,550
世界在她的歲月中粉碎瓦解
The world of her youth had fallen into pieces

1652
02:03:53,634 --> 02:03:57,512
然後形成一個新世界  而她並未察覺
and rebuilt itself without her ever noticing.

1653
02:03:58,097 --> 02:04:01,266
純真無邪的她
This hard, bright blindness,

1654
02:04:01,350 --> 02:04:04,436
似乎很難意識到週遭的變動
her incapacity to recognise change,

1655
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:09,107
因此兒女就像阿切爾一樣  不願對她透露內心的看法
made her children conceal their views from her, just as Archer concealed his.

1656
02:04:10,609 --> 02:04:14,112
她死時仍然覺得這世界是一片樂土
She died thinking the world a good place,

1657
02:04:14,196 --> 02:04:17,740
充滿愛與和諧  就像她的家庭一樣
full of loving and harmonious households like her own.

1658
02:04:19,326 --> 02:04:22,662
紐倫德·阿切爾在五十七歲時
Newland Archer, in his 57th year,

1659
02:04:22,746 --> 02:04:25,582
追憶過去  感慨萬千
mourned his past and honoured it.

1660
02:04:29,587 --> 02:04:31,713
喂
Yes, hello? Hello?

1661
02:04:31,797 --> 02:04:33,465
芝哥加電話
Chicago wants you.

1662
02:04:33,549 --> 02:04:34,799
喂
Hello?

1663
02:04:34,884 --> 02:04:36,676
- 爸  - 泰德  是你嗎
- Dad? - Is that you, Ted?

1664
02:04:36,760 --> 02:04:38,470
爸  我剛完工
Dad, I'm just about finished out here,

1665
02:04:38,554 --> 02:04:41,473
但客戶要求我去看幾座花園  再著手設計
but my client wants me to look at some gardens before I start designing.

1666
02:04:41,557 --> 02:04:42,974
不錯嘛  在哪兒
That sounds fine. Where?

1667
02:04:43,058 --> 02:04:44,684
- 歐洲  - 天啊
- Europe. - Gracious.

1668
02:04:44,768 --> 02:04:47,604
我下週三搭船過去
I'll have to sail next Wednesday on the Mauretania.

1669
02:04:47,688 --> 02:04:49,939
什麼  要錯過自己的婚禮嗎
What, and miss the wedding?

1670
02:04:50,024 --> 02:04:51,316
我想安妮會等我的
I think Annie will wait for me.

1671
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:53,735
我一號就回來了  趕得上五號的婚禮
I'll be back on the 1st, and our wedding's not till the 5th.

1672
02:04:53,819 --> 02:04:55,445
沒想到你還記得日期
I'm surprised you remember the date.

1673
02:04:55,529 --> 02:04:59,240
- 希望你能和我一起去  - 什麼
- Well... Dad, I was hoping you'd join me. - What?

1674
02:04:59,325 --> 02:05:01,826
我需要你提醒我孰重孰輕
I'll need you to remind me of what's important.

1675
02:05:01,911 --> 02:05:04,287
結婚前的最後一次父子同游
What do you say? It will be our last father-and-son trip.

1676
02:05:04,371 --> 02:05:06,831
- 感謝你的邀請  - 太好了
- Well, Ted, I do appreciate the invitation... - Wonderful!

1677
02:05:06,916 --> 02:05:08,875
明天記得訂船票
Can you call the Cunard office first thing tomorrow?

1678
02:05:08,959 --> 02:05:11,628
但我得取消
But it would take me till next Wednesday just to cancel my...

1679
02:05:11,712 --> 02:05:15,215
我不想聽  大西洋正在召喚我們
I won't hear it, Dad. The Atlantic is calling us.

1680
02:05:15,299 --> 02:05:17,675
週一我就到紐約
I'll be in New York on Monday, and I'll contact you then.

1681
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:19,385
- 什麼時候  - 星期一
- You'll be in New... - On Monday.

1682
02:05:19,470 --> 02:05:20,678
我盡力就是了
I'll see what I can do.

1683
02:05:20,763 --> 02:05:21,930
訂購船票  爸
Settle the tickets, Dad.

1684
02:05:22,014 --> 02:05:25,308
我不能拍胸脯保證  我盡力就是了
I can't promise anything, Ted. I'll see what I can do. All right.

1685
02:05:25,392 --> 02:05:26,643
- 再見  - 再見
- Bye-bye. - Bye.

1686
02:05:45,496 --> 02:05:48,414
我要和透娜去凡爾賽宮  你去不去
I'm going out to Versailles with Tourneur. Will you join us?

1687
02:05:48,499 --> 02:05:51,209
我想去羅浮宮
I thought I'd go to the Louvre.

1688
02:05:51,293 --> 02:05:53,002
那麼我去找你
I'll meet you there later then.

1689
02:05:53,087 --> 02:05:55,880
我跟奧蘭斯卡伯爵夫人約在五點半見
Countess Olenska's expecting us at 5:30.

1690
02:05:56,507 --> 02:05:58,299
什麼
What?

1691
02:05:58,384 --> 02:05:59,509
我沒告訴你嗎
Didn't I tell you?

1692
02:06:00,302 --> 02:06:03,388
安妮要我在巴黎為她做三件事
Annie made me swear to do three things in Paris.

1693
02:06:03,472 --> 02:06:05,848
幫她買套德彪西的最新曲譜合輯
Get her the score of the last Debussy songs,

1694
02:06:05,933 --> 02:06:09,394
去大木偶劇院  以及去看奧蘭斯卡夫人
go to the Grand Guignol, and see Madame Olenska.

1695
02:06:09,478 --> 02:06:10,680
博弗特送安妮來索邦大學讀書時
You know, she was awfully good to Annie

1696
02:06:10,720 --> 02:06:13,565
她待她好極了
when Mr. Beaufort sent her over to the Sorbonne.

1697
02:06:13,649 --> 02:06:16,568
伯爵夫人跟博弗特的前妻關係不太好  對嗎
Wasn't the Countess friendly with Mr. Beaufort's first wife or something?

1698
02:06:16,652 --> 02:06:19,320
博弗特先生是這麼說的
I think Mrs. Beaufort said that she was.

1699
02:06:19,405 --> 02:06:22,490
總之  早上我打了電話給伯爵夫人
In any case, I called the Countess first thing this morning,

1700
02:06:22,575 --> 02:06:24,784
告訴她我是她的外甥
introduced myself as her cousin.

1701
02:06:24,868 --> 02:06:27,412
你提到過我也來了嗎
Did you tell her I was here, Ted?

1702
02:06:27,496 --> 02:06:30,290
當然  有何不可
Of course. Why not?

1703
02:06:30,374 --> 02:06:32,792
她聽起來很可愛  她一向如此嗎
She sounds lovely. Was she?

1704
02:06:37,214 --> 02:06:38,423
可愛
Lovely?

1705
02:06:41,510 --> 02:06:44,220
我不知道  她變了
I don't know. She was different.

1706
02:06:57,693 --> 02:07:00,987
每當憶起艾倫·奧蘭斯卡
Whenever he thought of Ellen Olenska,

1707
02:07:01,071 --> 02:07:04,073
他總感覺虛幻寧靜
it had been abstractly, serenely,

1708
02:07:04,158 --> 02:07:07,535
宛如畫中的仕女
like an imaginary loved one in a book or picture.

1709
02:07:12,374 --> 02:07:16,169
她象徵他所錯失的一切
She had become the complete vision of all that he had missed.

1710
02:07:21,133 --> 02:07:23,009
我才五十七歲啊
I'm only 57.

1711
02:07:28,515 --> 02:07:30,516
博弗特再婚時
Did Mr. Beaufort really have such a bad time of it

1712
02:07:30,601 --> 02:07:32,185
阻力真有這麼大嗎
when he wanted to remarry?

1713
02:07:32,269 --> 02:07:34,437
大家都不謙讓他一分
No one wanted to give him an inch?

1714
02:07:34,521 --> 02:07:37,398
或許是以前謙讓過太多
Perhaps because he'd already taken so much.

1715
02:07:38,651 --> 02:07:41,569
但現在誰還記得  誰還在乎呢
As if anyone remembers any more, or cares.

1716
02:07:42,738 --> 02:07:47,158
安妮·瑞茵為他生了個寶貝女兒  你真幸運
Well, Annie Ring and he did have a lovely daughter. You're very lucky.

1717
02:07:48,077 --> 02:07:50,244
你是指我們都很幸運
We're very lucky, you mean.

1718
02:07:50,788 --> 02:07:52,997
當然
Yes, of course that's what I mean.

1719
02:07:53,082 --> 02:07:56,668
人生至此  早已事過境遷
So considering how that all turned out, and all the time that's gone by,

1720
02:07:56,752 --> 02:07:59,003
你怎麼還要抗拒呢
I don't see how you can resist.

1721
02:07:59,088 --> 02:08:02,340
你們結婚  我一開始也無法接受
I did have some resistance at first to your marriage, as I told you...

1722
02:08:02,424 --> 02:08:06,803
我是指你拒絕見一個你差點為她犧牲一切的女人
No. I mean resist seeing the woman you almost threw everything over for.

1723
02:08:07,971 --> 02:08:09,639
只是你懸崖勒馬了
Only you didn't.

1724
02:08:10,474 --> 02:08:11,766
我懸崖勒馬
I didn't?

1725
02:08:12,935 --> 02:08:14,102
沒錯
No.

1726
02:08:15,270 --> 02:08:16,550
但母親說
But Mother said that she knew

1727
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:19,000
- 我們都會安然無恙的  - 你母親
- we would be safe with you. - Your mother?

1728
02:08:19,316 --> 02:08:23,319
還記得她臨終的前一天  要單獨跟我談嗎
Yes. The day before she died she asked to see me alone. Remember?

1729
02:08:24,738 --> 02:08:26,948
她說她放心把這個家交給你
She said she knew we were safe with you,

1730
02:08:27,032 --> 02:08:29,117
一直如此安心
and always would be,

1731
02:08:29,201 --> 02:08:32,286
因為你曾答應她
because once, when she asked you to,

1732
02:08:33,539 --> 02:08:36,374
放棄你的最愛
you gave up the thing that you wanted most.

1733
02:08:49,138 --> 02:08:50,722
她從未提起此事
She never asked.

1734
02:08:53,892 --> 02:08:55,810
她從未要求過我
She never asked me.

1735
02:09:03,318 --> 02:09:07,321
一會兒之後  他對泰德的直率不再感到懊惱
After a little while he did not regret Ted's indiscretion.

1736
02:09:08,365 --> 02:09:12,160
他的心結終於鬆綁
It seemed to take an iron band from his heart to know that,

1737
02:09:12,244 --> 02:09:16,164
畢竟  終究有人猜到而且憐憫過他
after all, someone had guessed and pitied,

1738
02:09:17,040 --> 02:09:22,003
而那個人居然是自己的太太  這更叫他感動莫名
and that it should have been his wife moved him inexpressibly.

1739
02:09:40,606 --> 02:09:43,191
門童說她住在三樓
The porter says it's the third floor.

1740
02:09:45,527 --> 02:09:47,945
一定是有兩篷的那一戶
Must be the one with the awnings.

1741
02:09:50,908 --> 02:09:52,533
快六點了
It's nearly 6:00.

1742
02:09:55,037 --> 02:09:57,497
我想坐一會兒
I think I'll just sit for a while.

1743
02:10:00,834 --> 02:10:02,919
你不想上去嗎
Do you mean you won't come?

1744
02:10:05,714 --> 02:10:08,633
- 真的不上去嗎  - 我也不知道
- You really won't come at all? - I don't know.

1745
02:10:10,636 --> 02:10:12,428
她不會理解的
She won't understand.

1746
02:10:13,806 --> 02:10:16,224
去吧  泰德  也許我隨後就到
Go on, Ted. Maybe I'll follow you.

1747
02:10:20,312 --> 02:10:21,562
我該怎麼告訴她
What will I tell her?

1748
02:10:22,731 --> 02:10:25,399
你不是最能言善道了嗎
Don't you always have something to say?

1749
02:10:28,570 --> 02:10:30,112
我說你很老派
I'll tell her you're old-fashioned,

1750
02:10:30,197 --> 02:10:34,700
堅持走樓梯  而不願意去乘電梯
and you insist on walking up three flights instead of taking the elevator.

1751
02:10:42,709 --> 02:10:44,836
就說我很老派
Just say I'm old-fashioned.

1752
02:10:46,088 --> 02:10:48,589
這足夠了  去吧
That should be enough. Go on.

1753
02:10:50,759 --> 02:10:51,926
去吧
Go on.

1754
02:13:09,450 --> 02:13:19,600
