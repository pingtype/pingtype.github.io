{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}你們好  這群我生命中的過客
Hello, birds I won't get to know well.

225
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,990
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}顯然有人沒看到備忘錄
Hey, apparently somebody

226
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,510
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}我們一般準時開始上課
didn't get the memo that we like to start on time

227
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,760
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}而你們大概遲到了兩分鐘
because you're about two minutes late.

228
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,630
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}下不為例
Don't let it happen again.

229
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,450
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}我叫查克
Hi, my name is Chuck.

230
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,660
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}很抱歉你剛來就讓你難堪
I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.

231
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,970
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}我很喜歡你  我確定
I like you a lot. I can tell.

232
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,440
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}好吧
Okay.

233
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,480
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}大紅  你想和我們分享下你的故事嗎
Now, Red, would you like to share your story with us?

234
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,670
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}不是很想
No, not really.

235
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,900
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}法院提到在一個孩子的生日派對上
Well, the court mentioned something about a rage episode

236
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,250
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}出現了很狂暴的行為
at a child's birthday party.

237
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,910
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}這課我要上多久
How long is this class, anyway?

238
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,530
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}只要你做到就結束了
As long as you make it.

239
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,230
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}真的嗎  好吧
Really? Oh, okay.

240
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,370
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}先生們  很高興見到并差點認識你們
Uh, gentlemen, very nice to see you, and to almost meet you.

241
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,200
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}也許不結識你們才是最好的結果
Probably the nicest part of it is not getting to meet you,

242
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:57,960
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}雖然這理由有些奇怪
you know, in some weird way.

243
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,410
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}那么  我就準備
All right, so I'm gonna go ahead

244
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,770
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}轉身經過哪些詭異的雕像  然后...
and scoot on back out past those creepy statues and, uh...

245
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,070
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}坐下吧你
Back you go.

246
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,090
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}好吧  我坐下好了
Sure. No, I can take a seat.

247
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,380
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}說得更明白點
So, in another sense,

248
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,370
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}你要在這里呆到我通知法院
you are here until I notify the court

249
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,520
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}你憤怒的毛病治好了
that your anger issues have been resolved.

250
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,590
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}不是吧
Oh, boy.

251
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,390
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}查克
Chuck!

252
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,190
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}來和大紅說說你的故事
Share your story with Red.

253
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,310
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}我  我才是最不該來這的人
Me? I am the last guy who should be here.

254
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,750
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}只是收到了超速罰單
Simple speeding ticket.

255
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,070
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}法官說我跑太快了
Judge tells me I was going too fast,

256
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,680
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}于是我說  "法官大人  我的確超速了
so I say, "Your Honor, to be honest, I was.

257
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,470
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}"我認罪"
"You caught me."

258
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,890
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}我沒有憤怒  我是誠實
I'm not angry. I'm honest.

259
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,380
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}所以我該被訓練不說實話才對
So, shouldn't I be in honesty management class?

260
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,910
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}因為我們不要總說實話
'Cause we gotta manage my honesty.

261
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:41,910
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}我有個問題  這和你上次說的故事不一樣
My one problem, that's a different story than you told last time.

{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}如果你們想留下  你們為什么不直說呢
If you are staying, why don't you just say so?

768
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,100
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}你們為什么要離開家
And why'd you leave your home?

769
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,240
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}我們怎么知道你們不是逃犯
How do we know you're not fugitives of the law?

770
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,960
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}你讓我們的客人不舒服了
You are making our guests feel unwelcome!

771
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,990
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}你卻連基本的問題都不問
And you're not asking basic questions.

772
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,720
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}可能我沒說清楚
Maybe I wasn't clear enough.

773
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,760
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}我們不需要你的意見
Your opinion is not needed!

774
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,930
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}為什么我們要意見一致呢
Why do we have to agree?

775
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,550
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}我們不一樣又怎么了
Why does it matter that we're not the same?

776
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,470
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}憤怒并不能解決所有問題
Anger is not always the answer!

777
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,300
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}觀光繼續
Continue the tour.

778
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,210

Surf's up, you guys.

- So, get ready to hang loose. - That went well,

Dummy.

We could really use you right about now.

Wait, actually...

{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}查克媽媽你好
Hey, Chuck's mom.

787

{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}你兒子能出來玩嗎
Can your son come out to play?

788
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,430
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}天生麗質也是需要保養的
All of this does not just happen on its own.

789
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:54,710
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}爆爆窩

790
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:56,880
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}剛在洗澡
Just taking a shower.

791
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,890
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}爆爆  不用解釋這么多的
Bomb, buddy, TMI.

792
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:02,220
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}說真的  我篤定這些豬動機不純
Now, I'm telling you, something isn't kosher with these pigs.

793
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:05,190
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}-正中靶心  -我們應該把這事兒弄清楚
- Bull's-eye! - And it's up to us to figure it out.

794
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,880
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}到底弄清楚什么
Figure what out, exactly?

795
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,750
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}不知道  也許他們只是比較有創意
I don't know, maybe they're just being innovative.

796
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:09,560
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}繼續
Go ahead.

797
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,750
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}都上來
All aboard!

798
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,660
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}但確實有點奇怪
Does seem a little odd, though.

799
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,810
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}-搞定  -完美
- Nailed it! - Flawless.

800
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:22,990
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}拜托  這對你們來說一點都不奇怪嗎
Come on, does none of this seem wrong to you guys?

801
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,830
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}我跟你說  能參透這些豬的動機人...
I'll tell you this, if anyone knows what these pigs are up to...

802
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,530
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}非無敵神鷹莫屬了
it's Mighty Eagle.

803
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,550
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}無敵神鷹
Mighty Eagle!

804
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,230
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}沒錯
Oh, yeah!

805
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,350
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}嘗嘗我的厲害
Take that, tree!

806

Tasty!

808
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,230
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}無敵神鷹
Mighty Eagle!

809
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:04,020
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}你們好  小鳥島的子民們
Hello, Bird Island!

810
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:11,590
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}無敵神鷹

811
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,070
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}不謝
You're welcome.

812
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:14,510
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}無敵神鷹還活著嗎
Does Mighty Eagle still live?

813
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:15,390
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}他活過嗎
Did he ever live?

814
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,000
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}如果他確實活過  他住哪兒
And if he did live, where would he live?

815
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,790
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}住在上古之樹上的智慧之湖邊
By the Lake of Wisdom in the Ancient Tree.

816
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:20,970
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}那是童話故事
That's a fairy tale.

817
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,180
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}這個島所有地方我都去過了
I've run all over this island.

818
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,760
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}根本沒有那地方
Where could that possibly be?

819
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,500
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}在高處
Way up high.

820
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,990
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}在那高高的山巔
It's a long way up that mountain,

821
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,620
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}并且實話說了吧
and if I'm being honest,

822
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,970
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}我的意思是  你們去也能幫幫手
well, I mean, you know, I could kind of use your help.

823
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:35,840
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}什么  你想說什么
What's that? What are you trying to say?

824
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,020
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}沒什么  我只是想說
Nothing. I was just saying that I,

825
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,600
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}你們去說不定能幫上忙
you know, I could use your help.

826
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:40,890
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}抱歉  你的自尊把你話音都蓋住了
I'm sorry, I couldn't quite hear you over your ego.

827
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:42,940
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}你能把最后那個詞說清楚嗎
Could you enunciate that last word a little bit?

828
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,350
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}我需要你們幫助
I need your help!

829
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:47,190
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}你為什么不直說呢
Why didn't you say so?

830
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:47,880
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}爆爆
Bomb?

831
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,800
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}那我們就出發吧
Let's do it!

832
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,460
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}如果無敵神鷹真的存在
If there is a Mighty Eagle,

833
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:59,020
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}為什么我們從來沒聽見過他的戰吼
well, how come we don't ever hear his battle cry?

834
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,030
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}我不知道
I don't know.

835
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,330
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}也許我們聽過
Maybe we have.

836
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,970
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}無敵神鷹的戰吼會是什么樣子呢
What would a Mighty Eagle battle cry sound like?

837
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,160
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}我知道了
You know what? I think I got an idea.

838
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,650
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}也許就像...
Maybe something like ...

839
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,320
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}不  我猜應該是...
No, I bet it's more like...

840
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,990
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}理論上更像這樣  科學地說
That's theoretically what it's more like, scientifically.

841
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:15,940
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}我知道了
I got one.

842
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,460
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}不賴  這是個好主意
Not bad. It's a good impression.

843
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,330
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}但在我想象當中
But in my head,

844
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:25,550
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}我更覺得應該是這樣...
I'm kind of imagining it's something more like a...

845
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:34,320
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}這樣才像那么回事
That sounds about right.

846
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,570
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}現在我覺得可能更精妙一些
Now I'm thinking maybe it's a little bit more subtle.

847
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:38,860
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}應該會氣勢磅礴一些...
Like a little bit just more majestic, like...

848
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,510
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}"你好  世界"
"Hello, world"

849
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:56,250
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}"我在為你吶喊"
"I am calling for you"

850
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,750
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}別再學無敵神鷹的喊叫了
Stop making Mighty Eagle noises!

851
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,460
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}像開托兒所一樣
It's like running a nursery.

852
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:02,080
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}就是倆熊孩子
Absolute child care.

853
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,410
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}某些人的暴脾氣又犯了
Someone has anger issues.

854
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:14,130
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}我們...  爬錯山了
This, uh... This is the wrong mountain.

855
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:18,040
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}我的腿都要疼死了
My calves are killing me.

856
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,600
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}簡直跟做夢似的
That is simply unreal.

857
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,320
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}智慧之湖
The Lake of Wisdom.

858
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,250
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}你們還在等什么
What are you guys waiting for?

859
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,710
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}兄弟們  快來
Guys, hurry up!

860
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:04,440
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}這就是媽媽曾經告訴我的
This is what Mama talked about!

861
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,700
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}跟我說實話  我聽起來更聰明了嗎
Be honest, do I sound any wiser?

862
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,570
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}聰明多了
Oh, way wiser.

863
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:18,840
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}你之前有點笨  終于可以說出口了
You were kind of dumb before. I can say that now.

864
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,540
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}這水真不是開玩笑
That water is no joke.

865
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:24,680
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}我真的能感覺到聰明智慧
I can literally taste the intelligence and wisdom circulating

866

{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}-正在我體內流轉  -伙計們
- through my body now. - Guys,

867

{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}這里沒人  這地方荒廢多年了
nobody's here. I mean, nobody's used this place in years.

868
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:32,010
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}你們在做什么
What are you doing?

869
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:34,580
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}快出來
Get out of there.

870
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:46,750
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}別吐到他嘴里
Don't spit in his mouth.

871
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,700
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}別又吐回去啊
No, don't spit it back!

872
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,830
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}千萬不要吞下去
Oh, don't swallow it.

873
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,570
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}惡心
Yuck!

874
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:07,410
{\pos(287,280)\fscx50}出來  走了  快點
Get out. Let's go. Come on.

Come. Take your time, will you?

Me? I am the last guy who should be here.

{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}只是收到了超速罰單
Simple speeding ticket.

1932

So, shouldn't I be in honesty management class?

1937
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,910
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}因為我們不要總說實話
'Cause we gotta manage my honesty.

Can I just say I never understand a single thing

If you are staying, why don't you just say so?

Why do we have to agree?

2452

{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}我們不一樣又怎么了
Why does it matter that we're not the same?

2453
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,470
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}憤怒并不能解決所有問題
Anger is not always the answer!

All of this does not just happen on its own.

Now, I'm telling you, something isn't kosher with these pigs.

2470

{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}-正中靶心  -我們應該把這事兒弄清楚
- Bull's-eye! - And it's up to us to figure it out.

2471
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,880
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}到底弄清楚什么
Figure what out, exactly?

2472
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,750
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}不知道  也許他們只是比較有創意
I don't know, maybe they're just being innovative.

2473
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:09,560
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}繼續
Go ahead.

Come on, does none of this seem wrong to you guys?

2478

{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}我跟你說  能參透這些豬的動機人...
I'll tell you this, if anyone knows what these pigs are up to...

Did he ever live?

2491

And if he did live, where would he live?

2492

{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}住在上古之樹上的智慧之湖邊
By the Lake of Wisdom in the Ancient Tree.

2493

{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}那是童話故事
That's a fairy tale.

2500
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:35,840
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}什么  你想說什么
What's that? What are you trying to say?

2501
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,020
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}沒什么  我只是想說
Nothing. I was just saying that I,

2502
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,600
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}你們去說不定能幫上忙
you know, I could use your help.

2503
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:40,890
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}抱歉  你的自尊把你話音都蓋住了
I'm sorry, I couldn't quite hear you over your ego.

2504
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:42,940
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}你能把最后那個詞說清楚嗎
Could you enunciate that last word a little bit?

2505
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,350
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}我需要你們幫助
I need your help!

2506
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:47,190
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}你為什么不直說呢
Why didn't you say so?

2507
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:47,880
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}爆爆
Bomb?

2508
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,800
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}那我們就出發吧
Let's do it!

2509
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,460
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}如果無敵神鷹真的存在
If there is a Mighty Eagle,

2510
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:59,020
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}為什么我們從來沒聽見過他的戰吼
well, how come we don't ever hear his battle cry?

2511
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,030
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}我不知道
I don't know.

2512
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,330
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}也許我們聽過
Maybe we have.

2513
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,970
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}無敵神鷹的戰吼會是什么樣子呢
What would a Mighty Eagle battle cry sound like?

2514
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,160
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}我知道了
You know what? I think I got an idea.

2515
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,650
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}也許就像...
Maybe something like ...

2516
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,320
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}不  我猜應該是...
No, I bet it's more like...

2517
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,990
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}理論上更像這樣  科學地說
That's theoretically what it's more like, scientifically.

2518
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:15,940
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}我知道了
I got one.

2519
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,460
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}不賴  這是個好主意
Not bad. It's a good impression.

2520
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,330
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}但在我想象當中
But in my head,

2521
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:25,550
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}我更覺得應該是這樣...
I'm kind of imagining it's something more like a...

2522
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:34,320
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}這樣才像那么回事
That sounds about right.

2523
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,570
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}現在我覺得可能更精妙一些
Now I'm thinking maybe it's a little bit more subtle.

2524
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:38,860
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}應該會氣勢磅礴一些...
Like a little bit just more majestic, like...

2525
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,510
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}"你好  世界"
"Hello, world"

2526
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:56,250
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}"我在為你吶喊"
"I am calling for you"

2527
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,750
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}別再學無敵神鷹的喊叫了
Stop making Mighty Eagle noises!

2528
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,460
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}像開托兒所一樣
It's like running a nursery.

2529
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:02,080
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}就是倆熊孩子
Absolute child care.

2530
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,410
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}某些人的暴脾氣又犯了
Someone has anger issues.

2531
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:14,130
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}我們...  爬錯山了
This, uh... This is the wrong mountain.

2532
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:18,040
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}我的腿都要疼死了
My calves are killing me.

2533
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,600
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}簡直跟做夢似的
That is simply unreal.

2534
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,320
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}智慧之湖
The Lake of Wisdom.

2535
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,250
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}你們還在等什么
What are you guys waiting for?

2536
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,710
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}兄弟們  快來
Guys, hurry up!

2537
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:04,440
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}這就是媽媽曾經告訴我的
This is what Mama talked about!

2538
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,700
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}跟我說實話  我聽起來更聰明了嗎
Be honest, do I sound any wiser?

2539
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,570
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}聰明多了
Oh, way wiser.

2540
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:18,840
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}你之前有點笨  終于可以說出口了
You were kind of dumb before. I can say that now.

2541
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,540
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}這水真不是開玩笑
That water is no joke.

2542
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:24,680
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}我真的能感覺到聰明智慧
I can literally taste the intelligence and wisdom circulating

2543
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,040
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}-正在我體內流轉  -伙計們
- through my body now. - Guys,

2544
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,150
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}這里沒人  這地方荒廢多年了
nobody's here. I mean, nobody's used this place in years.

2545
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:32,010
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}你們在做什么
What are you doing?

2546
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:34,580

Get out of there.

Don't spit in his mouth.

2548
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,700
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}別又吐回去啊
No, don't spit it back!

2549
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,830
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}千萬不要吞下去
Oh, don't swallow it.

2550
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,570
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}惡心
Yuck!

Come. Take your time, will you?

2553

Horrible turn of events. Horrible.

2559
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,980
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}好吧  與其說是智慧湖
Well, not so much the Lake of Wisdom,

2560
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,700
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}不如說是噓噓湖
it's more like the Lake of Whiz.

2561
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,940
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}你們只是來瞻仰一下我
Did you just come here to look at me?

2562
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:46,060
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}還是有什么要對我說
Or did you have something to say?

2563
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,490
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}我覺得他看到我們了
I think he saw us.

2564
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:49,750
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}還用你說
Oh, you think so?

{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}你們已經通過了第一道測試
You have passed the first test!

What are your names?

2573

If you know all, why don't you know who we are?

Can we have some?

{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}智慧不是別人賦予的
Wisdom is not something that is given.

2578

{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}別走  別走  我能幫你們獲得智慧嗎
No, no, no, no. Will I help you attain wisdom?

{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}當然  不在話下
Yes. That I will do.

{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}好吧  我們爬山是因為
Right. So, the reason we've climbed the mountain

2583
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:45,580
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}我們想知道...
is that we want to know...

You might want to shield your eyes

2592
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:07,290
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}免得被獎杯的光芒閃瞎
from the sparkle of those trophies.

2593

Wow, this is way nicer than my Hall of Wimpiness.

2596
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:16,150
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}約嗎  辣妹
Bring it home, mamacita.

2597

Get outta town.

{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}怎么回事...
What the...

Those are some old-school moves there.

2600

{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}好吧  他算是個怪人
So, he's kind of a wackadoodle.

2604
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,110
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}并不代表他沒有智慧
You know, that doesn't mean he's not wise.

2605
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:55,430
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}厭倦了用笨重的空氣充氣球了嗎
Hey, are you tired of filling your balloons with heavy old air?

2606
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,530
{\pos(97,280)\fscx50}終于有更好的方法了
Finally, there's a better way.

It's a gas.

2609
