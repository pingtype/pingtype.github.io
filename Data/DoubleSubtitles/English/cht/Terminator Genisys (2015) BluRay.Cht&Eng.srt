<i>他解放了人類</i>

<i>他教會我們如何打倒那些機器</i>

<i>他們說約翰是先知</i>
<i>They use words like "prophet."</i>

47
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,465
<i>可他不止如此</i>
<i>But John is more.</i>

51
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,387
長官  我請求參加科羅拉多進攻戰
Sir? Request to join the Colorado offensive.

52
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,510
你得跟著我  瑞斯
I need you with me, Reese.

53
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,140
那關繫著能否徹底摧毀天網  長官
We're talking about the complete destruction of Skynet, sir.

54
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,388
科羅拉多小隊會取得成功的
The Colorado unit will succeed.

55
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,667
今晚就是天網的末日
The machines will fall tonight.

56
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,825
但是在這邊的洛杉磯攻勢
But right here, the Los Angeles assault

57
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,470
也許比那兒更加重要
is just as important, maybe more.

58
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,060
難道比摧毀天網的主機更重要
More important than destroying the Skynet's central core?

59
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,465
約翰  我不明白  為什麼要對一個勞動集中營進攻
John, I don't understand why you're leading an attack on a work camp.

60
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,230
那個集中營只是個偽裝
Because the camp is a camouflage.

61
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,584
<i>那裏有個停機坪</i>
<i>Inside the camp is a hangar.</i>

62
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,783
<i>而天網的終極武器就藏在那下面</i>
<i>Beneath that hangar Skynet has hidden its final weapon.</i>

63
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,550
<i>當天網意識到輸了的時候</i>
<i>When Skynet realizes it has lost,</i>

64
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,306
<i>它就會利用那個武器來確保自身的安全</i>
<i>it will deploy that weapon to ensure its own survival.</i>

65
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,188
不解決它  我們就沒有明天
We take it tonight, or there is no tomorrow.

66
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,980
那我們解決它
Then we'll take it.

67
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,540
作為我的得力助手  我都沒說過謝謝
You're my right hand, Reese, and I've never thanked you for it.

68
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,820
沒必要說
You don't need to.

69
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,262
你給了我們希望  約翰
You gave us all a future, John.

70
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,426
我總是在想
I'm gonna use mine.

71
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,222
等這一切都結束了
When this is all over,

72
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,388
我要找到我父母的房子
I'm gonna find my parents' house.

73
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,184
重建它
Rebuild it.

74
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,746
用我的雙手  做些殺戮以外的事
Use my hands for something other than killing.

75
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,420
你呢
How about you?

76
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,988
來杯冰啤酒就行了
A cold beer would be good.

77
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,670
- 好大的計劃  - 呵呵呵
- That's some pretty big plans. - Yeah.

78
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,749
以後的事我都沒怎麼想過呢
Yeah, I guess I don't think about it too much.

79
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,191
我看出來了
I can see that.

80
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,262
我想不管怎麼樣
Well, I figure, whatever happens,

81
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,190
都不會比現在糟
it's got to be better than this.

82
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,822
走到這步我們犧牲了很多人
So many of us have died to get here.

83
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,546
我希望你能明白
I want you to know, Kyle,

84
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,987
我也不想選擇這條路
if there was another way, I would have taken it.

00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,308
洛杉磯  1984年
Los Angeles, 1984.

138
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,183
洛杉磯  5月12日
Los Angeles, May 12,

139
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,151
1984年
1984.

140
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,708
天網知道它輸了
Skynet knew it was losing,

141
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,670
所以它就作弊
so it tried to rig the game.

142
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,024
它把一個終結者送回戰爭開始之前
It sent a terminator back to the time before the war.

143
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,710
它的目標是誰
And who's the target?

144
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,467
我的媽媽
My mother.

145
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,306
莎拉·康納
Sarah Connor.

146
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,671
如果它成功了  我就不會出生
If the machine succeeds, I'll never be born.

147
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,910
把我媽媽殺掉
They'll kill her first.

148
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,344
用這種方式  來抹去我們勝利的歷史  也包括今晚
And by doing so, erase every victory we've fought for, including tonight's.

149
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,384
那樣就不會再有反抗它的抵抗軍
There won't be a resistance to challenge the machines.

150
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,341
只需要這一招  天網就能勝利
With this one act, Skynet will win.

151
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,145
我們也可以利用這項技術  把一個人送回去
We can use the technology ourselves, send someone back.

152
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,386
我們還不知道是否可行
We don't even know if that'll work.

153
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,990
- 讓我去吧  - 讓我去
- I'll go! - I'll go, sir!

154
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,340
- 我去  - 讓我去
- Right here. - I'll go!

155
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,507
讓我去吧
I'll go!

156
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,306
我願意去
I'll volunteer!

157
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,620
讓我回去
I'll go back.

158
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,900
這麼多人裏面
Why should I send you

159
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,600
我為何要選你
over all of them?

160
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,585
因為我會用生命保護她
Because I'd die for Sarah Connor.

161
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,870
這些人都會用生命去保護莎拉·康納
All these people would die for Sarah Connor.

162
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,708
你有什麼不同
What makes you any different?

163
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,185
你知道為什麼
You know why.

164
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,263
你跟我講過她的故事  我瞭解她  約翰
Everything you've told me about her. I know her, John.

165
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,591
讓我保護她
Let me save her.

166
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,740
不帶武器
No weapons?

167
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,226
我們測量過這個磁場
We've measured the magnetic field,

168
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,748
他會撕碎任何沒有被活體組織包裹的東西
it'll rip apart anything not encased in living tissue.

169
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,742
就像一張錫紙  在微波爐裏承受上億倍的熱量
Think tinfoil in a microwave times a few billion,

170
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,510
還是灰都不剩
nothing left but a crater.

171
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,431
噢
Oh!

172
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,110
衣服也不能穿
No clothes, either.

173
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,741
噢
Huh.

174
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,749
她一定會認為我瘋了
She's going to think I'm crazy.

175
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,950
你知道這裏有一台機器
You knew the device would be here.

176
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,424
你知道它設定的日期
You knew when it'd be set for.

177
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,622
你知道天網今晚會失敗
You knew the machines would fall tonight.

178
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,068
在我走之前  你告訴我
Just before I go, tell me...

179
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,586
告訴你什麼
Tell you what?

180
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,749
你看見未來了嗎
Do you see the future?

181
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,744
沒人能看到未來  瑞斯
No one can see the future, Reese.

182
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,789
那你是怎麼知道的
Okay, then how do you know?

183
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,106
我作弊了
I cheat.

184
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,147
這都是莎拉告訴我的  給我指示
Sarah told me so much. Gave me signposts.

185
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,385
我小的時候
When I was a kid,

186
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,269
覺得我媽媽好像什麼都知道
it seemed like my mother knew everything.

187
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,860
一定很棒吧
That must've been great.

188
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,311
也不一定
Not really.

189
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,180
到這兒就沒了
It stops here.

190
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,386
你回去以後的事兒我就不知道了
Once you go back, my knowledge ends.

191
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,111
莎拉也只知道這麼多
That's as much as Sarah knew.

192
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,225
到此為止了
So no more cheating.

193
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,384
到此為止了
No more cheating.

194
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,311
你回去的那個年代
The time you're going back to,

195
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,543
她還不是那個撫養我長大的戰士
she won't be the warrior that raised me, not yet.

196
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,983
她柔弱膽小
She'll be scared and weak.

197
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,068
也不知道該如何保護自己
She won't know how to fight or defend herself.

198
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,826
她擔心的只是房租和學費
Her biggest worry is making rent and tuition.

199
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,141
她是個服務員
She's a waitress.

200
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,461
是什麼
A what?

201
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,906
是
A...

202
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,740
別管這個了
Never mind.

203
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,664
你明白她需要你的保護就行了
Just be ready for the fact that she will need you,

204
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,821
有些事兒她還不知道
but she won't know it.

205
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,507
那我該跟她說什麼
Okay, so what do I say to her?

206
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,901
就算告訴她我是誰  她也不會信吶
Even when I tell her who I am, she's not gonna believe me.

207
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,185
<i>你告訴她</i>
<i>Tell her this...</i>

208
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,501
<i>莎拉  謝謝你能勇敢地面對那個黑暗年代</i>
<i>Thank you, Sarah, for your courage during the dark years.</i>

209
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,661
<i>我沒能與你一起面對接下來的生活</i>
<i>I can't help you with what you must soon face,</i>

210
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,266
<i>但是未來是可以改變的</i>
<i>Except to say the future is not set.</i>

211
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,948
<i>儘管沒有希望  但是我們會為之奮鬥</i>
<i>There is no fate but that which we make for ourselves.</i>

212
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,423
<i>你可以比你自己認為的更加堅強</i>
<i>You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.</i>

213
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,710
<i>你一定要活下去</i>
<i>You must survive,</i>

214
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,062
<i>否則我將不復存在</i>
<i>or I will never exist.</i>

215
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,224
幫我照顧好她
Take care of her for me, Kyle.

216
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,460
我會的
I will.

217
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,471
我保證
I promise you.

218
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,223
你肩負的是這場戰爭成敗的關鍵
What you're doing right now, this is the end of the war.

219
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,782
你不會認為成功這麼容易吧
You didn't think it would be that easy, did you?

220
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,021
約翰
John!

221
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,630
嘿  小壽星
Hey, birthday boy!

222
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,909
禮物時間  快來吧
Present time. Let's go!

223
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,398
{\an8}創世紀

224
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,424
不會吧
No way!

225
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,584
創世紀一旦上線後就會自動更新
Genisys will auto-update as soon as it comes online.

226
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,823
你很快就能擁有它了
You'll have it the moment it comes out.

227
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,343
再過幾天就可以了
Just a few days more.

228
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,706
沿著一條直線
A straight line.

229
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,665
要記住  創世紀就是天網
Remember, Genisys is Skynet.

230
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:20,223
<i>創世紀一旦上線  審判日就會到來</i>
<i>When Genisys comes online, Judgment Day begins.</i>

231
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,863
你能在天網誕生前消滅它
You can kill Skynet before it's born.

232
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,631
嘿  嘿
Hey, hey...

233
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,550
嘿
Hey...

234
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,546
嘿
Hey.

235
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,106
嘿  兄弟
Hey, bud.

236
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,745
你剛才看見一道亮光嗎
Did you just see a real bright light?

237
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,820
嘿
Hey!

238
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,265
輪到我了
It's my turn.

239
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,871
哎
Hey, hey!

240
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,749
那兒什麼情況
What's wrong with this picture?

241
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,942
晚上出來溜達呀
Nice night for a walk, eh?

242
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,944
晚上出來溜達
Nice night for a walk.

243
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,740
明天要洗衣服  今天沒得穿  是嗎
Wash day tomorrow. Nothing clean, right?

244
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,581
現在沒得穿  是的
Nothing clean, right.

245
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,431
我估計這傢伙至少喝了一打啤酒吧
Hey, I think this guy's a couple cans short of a six-pack.

246
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,750
你們的衣服  脫下來給我  快點兒
Your clothes, give them to me. Now.

247
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,665
想什麼呢  混蛋
Hey, fuck you, asshole.

248
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,101
你別想再找衣服穿了
You won't be needing any clothes.

249
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,480
{\an8}型號  T-800  攜帶泵動散彈鎗

250
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,949
我已經等你很久了
I've been waiting for you.

251
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,265
嘿  那個混蛋把我的褲子搶走了
Hey! That son of a bitch just stole my pants!

252
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,462
今天是幾號  是哪一年
What day is it? What year?

253
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,948
1984年5月12日
May 12, 1984.

254
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,104
你到達的日子
The day you arrive.

255
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,385
警察  不許動
LAPD! Freeze!

256
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,068
噢  疼死我了
All right, that freakin' hurt.

257
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,109
- 蓋博  你沒事吧  - 你說呢  奧布萊恩
- Garber, you okay? - You tell me, O'Brien.

258
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,502
是人類  嘿  我得離開這兒
You're human. Hey, you got to let me go.

259
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,430
趴下  把手放到背後  不然我就開槍了
Face down! Hands on your back, or I will shoot!

260
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,587
你們聽我說
Listen to me...

261
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,621
嘿
Hey!

262
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,745
他過來了  明白嗎
It's coming, all right?

263
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,910
相信我  不然我們都得死
You need to listen to me, or we're all going to die.

264
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,180
我已經把局面控制住了
I had it under control.

265
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,388
是吧  大偵探
Yeah, okay, T.J. Hooker.

266
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,427
你這是第一次出勤  我得提醒你
Here's what you don't do your first day on the beat.

267
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,060
別輕易對妄想癥流浪漢使用槍支
Use lethal force on the delusional homeless guy.

268
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,740
這次報告你來寫
By the way, you're filling out the paperwork on this.

269
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,265
蓋博
Garber!

270
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,701
見鬼
Shit.

271
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,820
那肯定是外星人  不是地球的人類
That's got to be an alien, like from outer space.

272
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,629
那是台專門殺人的機器
It's a machine that kills humans.

273
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,583
- 解開手銬  - 不行  你已經被捕了
- Uncuff me! - No! You're under arrest!

274
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,187
你怎麼回事兒  聽不懂我說他會殺人嗎
What part of "kills humans" is confusing to you?

275
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,144
快解開
Handcuffs!

276
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,270
我是奧布萊恩  有人受傷  需要支援
O'Brien. Officer down. We need backup.

277
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,625
有一個機器人
It's a robot!

278
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,621
- 咱倆死定了  - 差不多吧
- We're screwed, aren't we? - Pretty much.

279
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,664
想活命就跟我走
Come with me if you want to live.

280
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,346
快點兒  大兵
Now, soldier!

281
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,031
瑞斯  對吧
Reese, right?

282
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,031
凱爾·瑞斯
Kyle Reese?

283
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,862
- 你是莎拉  - 還用你說
- You're Sarah. - Yeah, I know that.

284
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,861
你腦袋被撞壞了
You hit your head back there?

285
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,308
有  有個終結者  我不知道型號
The terminator. I don't know the model.

286
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,702
T-1000  液態金屬  只要與對方接觸
T-1000. Liquid metal. Shape-changer.

287
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,060
就能模仿其外觀
It just needs to touch something to mimic it.

288
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,990
你瞭解終結者  你還知道我是誰
You know about terminators? And you know who I am?

289
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,148
你被反叛軍首領送回來保護我
You were sent to protect me by John Connor,

290
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,024
也就是約翰·康納
the leader of the Resistance.

291
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,427
我兒子
My son.

292
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,383
可是  你不該知道這些事啊
I don't understand. You can't know any of this.

293
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,740
可我知道了
But I do.

294
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,309
聽我說  瑞斯  全都變了
Listen to me, Reese, everything's changed.

295
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,185
約翰想把你送去的那個1984年已經不存在了
The 1984 John sent you to, it no longer exists.

296
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,428
不  這不對  是約翰送我回來保護你的
No, this is all wrong, all right? John sent me here to save you.

297
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,500
為了確保我不被終結者殺死
From the terminator that was sent back to kill me.

298
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,542
我知道  我們已經解決它了
I know, but we already took care of him.

299
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,901
我們
"We"?

300
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,026
快趴下
Get down!

301
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,985
瑞斯  住手
Reese, stop it!

302
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,746
真是見鬼了
Reese, God damn it!

303
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,100
- 待在這兒  - 瑞斯  等等
- Stay here! - Reese, wait!

304
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,830
那子彈會要他命的
Those bullets will kill him!

305
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,620
他是來殺你的  別出來
He's here to kill you! Stay in the truck!

306
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,425
噢  幹的真是太好了
Oh, great. That's just great.

307
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,269
我並沒有殺死他
I did not kill him.

308
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,461
時間不多了  T-1000很快就會發現我們的位置
We do not have long before the T-1000 acquires our position.

309
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,745
你和他爭吵
Arguing with Kyle Reese

310
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,505
會讓我們處於不利的戰略地位
puts us at a strategic disadvantage.

311
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,626
去死吧你
Bite me.

312
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,271
這是一個非常不成熟的回答
That is a very immature response.

313
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,305
你就是我命中注定的他嗎
So you're the one I've been waiting for all my life.

314
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,421
他怎麼樣了
How is he?

315
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,985
還有呼吸
Still breathing.

316
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,746
很好  那你可以
Good. Then you should

317
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,266
在這條時間線上和他交配了
be able to mate with Kyle Reese in this timeline.

318
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,145
算了  我不想再談論這個話題了
Okay, we're not having this conversation again.

319
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,302
我們知道你將會生下約翰·康納
We know that your son will be John Connor,

320
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,946
沒有他  人類將無法戰勝機器
and that the machines cannot be defeated without him.

321
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,300
你沒有其他選擇
I do not see a choice.

322
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,666
全都設定好了
Story of my life.

323
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,861
孩子不是說生就生
Look, and it's not just mating.

324
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,704
總得先跟他產生愛情吧
I'm supposed to fall in love with him.

325
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,709
我的數據沒有記錄愛情
My files do not deal with love.

326
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,510
我好驚訝呀
Shocker there.

327
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,980
你有些情緒化
You're being emotional.

328
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,427
這是我的人生  我不介意
This is my life. I wouldn't mind

329
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,663
偶爾找人討論一下我該往哪個方向發展
being consulted once in a while about how it's gonna go.

330
00:30:16,824 --> 00:30:20,130
生日快樂
Happy birthday to you.

331
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,300
{\an8}創世紀

332
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,820
要記住  創世紀就是天網
Remember, Genisys is Skynet.

333
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,184
<i>創世紀一旦上線  審判日就會到來</i>
<i>When Genisys comes online, Judgment Day begins.</i>

334
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,226
<i>去2017年的舊金山</i>
<i>Go to San Francisco, 2017.</i>

335
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,903
你能在天網誕生前消滅它
You can kill Skynet before it's born.

336
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,621
嘿
Hey!

337
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,708
你現在就跟我解釋一下
I need answers, all right. Right now.

338
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,191
那個液態金屬的東西怎麼知道我在那兒  啊
How'd that liquid metal thing know where to intercept me? Huh?

339
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,350
它從哪兒來的
Where'd it come from?

340
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,987
這傢伙到底是誰
And who the hell is this skin job?

341
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,391
這究竟是怎麼回事
What the hell is going on?

342
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,669
對不起  我們本來還在忙著討論那件生死攸關的事
Sorry, we were a little busy with the whole life-and-death combat thing.

343
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,987
然後你就沖老爹開槍
And then you attacked Pops.

344
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,506
你叫它老爹
You named it?

345
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,107
你好  凱爾·瑞斯
Hello, Kyle Reese.

346
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,228
我很高興認識你
It is nice to meet you.

347
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,026
你耍我嗎
Are you kidding me?

348
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,542
我一直在教他怎麼像個正常人
I've been trying to teach him to blend in.

349
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,744
他還需要努力
I know it needs work.

350
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,507
它是個終結者  它之所以跟人類一樣  就是因為它要殺人
It's a terminator! The only reason it blends in is to kill humans.

351
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,270
老爹不會殺人的
Pops doesn't kill anyone.

352
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,870
倒是打斷了不少人的腿
A lot of leg wounds, though.

353
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,551
它看著挺老
It looks old.

354
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,389
我不知道終結者也會變老
I've never seen a terminator old before.

355
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,309
他身上的那層皮
The flesh they put on the cyborgs

356
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,950
用的就是普通的人體組織
is normal human tissue.

357
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,261
當然會變老
It ages.

358
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,344
我的聽覺電路目前還沒有出現故障
My auditory circuits have not degraded, however.

359
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,746
我是老了
I'm old.

360
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,185
但不是沒用
Not obsolete.

361
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,980
你也許讓他傷心了
I think you hurt his feelings.

362
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,590
它不可能有感情
It doesn't have feelings!

363
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,508
他在我9歲的時候救了我
He saved my life when I was nine.

364
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,582
沒有他  我不可能活到現在
He's the only reason I'm alive.

365
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,460
我的程序設定是保護莎拉·康納
I was programmed to protect Sarah Connor.

366
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,100
我會一直保護她
I will not stop.

367
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,907
是誰給你設定的  啊  誰送他回來的
Yeah? Programmed by who? Huh? Who sent him back?

368
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,624
這些數據被刪除了
Those files have been erased.

369
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,821
噢  好借口啊
Oh, that's convenient.

370
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,544
那人不想讓我們知道他
Whoever sent him, they don't want us to know.

371
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,469
不管是我  是他  還是其他人
Not me, not him, not anyone.

372
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,622
這樣天網就沒法設定救我的那個人了
So Skynet can't target the person who saved me.

373
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,664
從邏輯上看  有人想讓莎拉·康納活下去
Logically, it is someone who wants Sarah Connor to live.

374
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,400
{\an8}液態金屬

375
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,906
老了
Old.

376
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,745
但不是沒用
Not obsolete.

377
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,428
T-1000已經知道我們在哪兒了
The T-1000 knows where we are.

378
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,584
你可別拖後腿
Make yourself useful.

379
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,470
而且不許對老爹開槍
And don't shoot Pops.

380
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,185
太瘋狂了
This is insane.

381
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,310
這一切不是我的任務
All of it. This is not the mission.

382
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,230
我想跟你說的是  瑞斯
That's what I'm trying to tell you, Reese.

383
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:14,867
那個你回來要保護的女孩兒  已經不在了
The girl that you came back for, she's gone.

384
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,223
我不需要別人保護
I don't need saving.

385
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,266
現在有新任務
There's a new mission.

386
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,546
什麼任務
Oh, yeah? Which is?

387
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,542
如果過去可以改變  那麼未來也一樣
If the past can change, then so can the future.

388
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:31,030
我們完全可以阻止宣判日的到來  永遠
We can stop Judgment Day from happening. Ever.

389
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,347
在天網誕生前消滅它
Kill Skynet before it's born.

390
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,266
什麼
What?

391
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,746
趴下
Get down!

392
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,946
我們被發現了
We have been reacquired.

393
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,226
怎麼可能  見鬼
Uh, yeah. No shit!

394
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,460
後退
Get back!

395
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,380
為什麼停車啦
Wait, why are we stopping?

396
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,302
等一下  嘿  我們待在這兒  會被它找到的
Why are we... Hey! We can't stay here, it'll find us.

397
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,149
正合我意  老爹  打開門
That's the idea. Pops, get it open.

398
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,627
搭把手
Give me a hand?

399
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,465
你說過去的變化改變了你
You said it happened 'cause the past was altered.

400
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,541
怎麼回事兒
How?

401
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,860
這很重要嗎
Oh, does that matter?

402
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,705
跟我說說  莎拉
How, Sarah?

403
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:29,183
有個終結者回到了我小的時候
A terminator was sent after me when I was a kid, okay?

404
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,864
終結者只來自一個地方  未來
Terminators only come from one place, the future.

405
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,945
但未來改變了
Something happened.

406
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,506
是啊  所以呢
Okay. So?

407
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,500
- 我可能看到了  - 什麼
- I think I might have seen it. - What...

408
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,504
你這話什麼意思
What are you talking about?

409
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,948
約翰送我來的時候被襲擊了
When John sent me back, he was attacked.

410
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,709
應該是  一個終結者
By a terminator.

411
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,187
終結者殺了他  約翰死了
Did it kill him? Is John dead?

412
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,180
我不知道
I don't know.

413
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,182
我只看到終結者在襲擊他
I saw it grab him, and then I was gone.

414
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,502
我們大約還有35秒鐘
We have approximately 35 seconds.

415
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,627
或者更短
Or less.

416
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,749
莎拉  快走
Sarah, go!

417
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,260
{\an8}系統初始化

418
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,141
我還自願參加這鬼任務
And I volunteered for this shit.

419
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,541
莎拉
Sarah?

420
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,706
幫我一下
You got to help me.

421
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,226
我受傷了
I'm hurt.

422
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,707
莎拉
Sarah?

423
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,751
見鬼
Shit.

424
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,909
嘿  是我  莎拉
Hey, it's me, Sarah!

425
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,625
莎拉  他在說謊
Sarah, he's lying.

426
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,181
嘿
Hey.

427
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,191
他是假的  我才是瑞斯
He's the machine. I'm Reese.

428
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,626
莎拉
It's me, Sarah.

429
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,628
你聽我說  終結者沒死  它襲擊了我
All right, listen, the terminator's not dead. It attacked me!

430
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,230
他能模仿我
Sarah, you said they could mimic.

431
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,427
是我  莎拉
It's me, Sarah!

432
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,470
- 他是假的  開槍  - 我才是瑞斯  衝他開槍
- He's mimicking. Shoot him! - I'm Reese! Shoot him!

433
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,744
這招不錯
Nice try.

434
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,101
快跑
Run!

435
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,943
你怎麼知道他是終結者
How'd you know which one was him?

436
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,667
這個  其實我不知道
Well, I didn't know exactly.

437
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,545
萬一你打到我呢
You could have shot me!

438
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,340
可是至少我確定不是你
Well, I was pretty sure it wasn't you.

439
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,986
你真確定
Pretty sure?

440
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,951
我們早已經為你的到來做好準備了
We've been prepping for you to arrive for over a decade.

441
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,346
還有它
That, too.

442
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,347
- 所以這是個陷阱  - 當然了
- So you set a trap. - Had to.

443
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,227
我們去之前還真用得上它
Can't leave any future tech behind when we go.

444
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,666
什麼
Go?

445
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,666
去哪兒
Go where?

446
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,870
噢  這不是
That's...

447
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,864
一台時空轉換機
A Time Displacement Device.

448
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,187
是啊  怎麼看著像是一堆破爛兒
Yeah, well, it looks like a piece of junk.

449
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,020
這個時代擁有的科技
There's no governing technology in this time

450
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,262
沒有辦法操控這台機器
that can control the displacement circuits.

451
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,543
你得用未來的中央處理器才能操控它
You needed the CPU from the future to make it run.

452
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,144
而且顯然你不能用自己的
And you couldn't exactly use your own.

453
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,380
我們只有一次機會  芯片會燒燬
We get one trip only. It's gonna fry the chip,

454
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,508
而且整個洛杉磯的電力會耗光
and take out most of the L.A. city power grid.

455
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,381
好了嗎
Are we ready?

456
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,502
坐標已經設定為1997年
The coordinates are set for 1997.

457
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,589
你要快點兒登上傳輸台
You must leave as soon as possible.

458
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,870
我們  是你和我  一起去
We. We're going. All of us.

459
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,708
我表皮的恢復需要很多年
My flesh will take years to regrow.

460
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,226
我不能跟你去
I cannot come with you

461
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,020
我得考慮到量子場的磁場效應
due to the magnetics of the quantum field.

462
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,061
老爹
Pops!

463
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,029
你想讓我們穿越時間
You want us to time travel?

464
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:19,030
去未來  用這玩意兒
Into the future. In that?

465
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,426
對  我們還不能穿衣服
Yeah, we can't be wearing anything.

466
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,110
我知道穿越時間有什麼要求
Yeah, I know how time travel works.

467
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,260
- 莎拉  - 你別想阻止我幹這件事
- Sarah... - Look, don't try and talk me out of it.

468
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:27,230
我知道你怎麼想的  把我關在一間屋子裏
Look, I know you think you're here so you can just lock me in a room

469
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,705
然後等我生下那個反叛軍首領
until I give birth to the leader of the Resistance.

470
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,781
說得沒錯
You're right.

471
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,904
但是  這才是能夠打敗天網的最佳辦法
But this... This is the only way to stop Skynet for good.

472
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,186
我贊同你的想法
I already said you're right.

473
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,431
你說什麼
Wait, what?

474
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,384
但不是97年
Not to '97.

475
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,750
是2017年
2017.

476
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,348
應該是2017年10月
Yeah, October 2017.

477
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,986
不  太晚了  那已經是宣判日之後了
No, that's too late. That's after Judgment Day.

478
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,266
你不是說一切都變了嗎
No, you said everything's changed,

479
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,387
這你也是對的
and you're right about that, too.

480
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,621
莎拉
Sarah...

481
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:55,863
我看到了另一個沒有發生戰爭的未來
Look, I've seen a world where the bombs never fell.

482
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,109
一樣的房子
All right? The same house.

483
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,144
一樣的家人
The same parents.

484
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:04,107
一樣的我  不一樣的是
It was the same me, only I was...

485
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,665
我在家裏
I was home.

486
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,188
那是我13歲的生日
It was my 13th birthday.

487
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,986
在夢中看到你的家人還在  這什麼也說明不了
A dream of having your family back doesn't mean a thing.

488
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,141
相信我
Trust me.

489
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,502
這不是夢  這  這是段記憶
Not a dream, all right? A memory.

490
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,029
我現在只能記住一些片段
I can't hold on to all of it, just moments,

491
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,148
我收到了一條信息
but I was given a message.

492
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,628
你能在天網誕生前消滅它
"You can kill Skynet before it's born."

493
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:31,300
天網就是創世紀
"Skynet is Genisys."

494
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,141
天網在2017年10月正式上線
It comes online October 2017.

495
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,901
它一旦上線  審判日就會到來
And when it does, Judgment Day happens.

496
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,146
你是在回憶未來嗎
So you're remembering the future?

497
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:39,307
不
No.

498
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,311
那是另一條平行時間線上的你
The boy is the alternate timeline version of you.

499
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:45,301
他是在回憶自己的過去
Kyle Reese is remembering his own past,

500
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,990
也就是我們的未來
which is our future.

501
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,989
你這解釋也太難懂了
That makes it so much better.

502
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,943
他怎麼可能有兩條時間線的回憶
How can he be remembering two timelines?

503
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,501
如果你剛好在量子場裏接觸到
It is possible if he were exposed to a nexus point

504
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,231
時間流中的某個連接點  就有可能
in the timeflow when you were in the quantum field.

505
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,269
你  你能讓他說得通俗點兒嗎
Can you stop him talking like that?

506
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,825
他身上有設置嗎
Is there a switch or something?

507
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,226
再說一次吧
Pops, try again.

508
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,145
連接點是在某個重要時刻發生的事件
A nexus point is an event in time of such importance

509
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,871
它能夠徹底改變整個未來的走向
that it gives rise to a vastly different future.

510
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,348
約翰被襲擊後  我在磁場中時
After John was attacked, when I was in the sphere,

511
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,740
那些記憶就出現了
that's when the memories began.

512
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:13,461
約翰
John!

513
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,348
如果約翰·康納被殺或者叛變
If John Connor were to be killed or compromised,

514
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:20,067
有可能使你同時擁有不同時間線的記憶
it could result in the ability to remember both pasts.

515
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,345
理論上是
Theoretically.

516
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,789
或者  理論上是
Or "theoretically"

517
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,101
給他的那一拳  把他腦子打壞了
his brain is scrambled from when you hit him on the head.

518
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,346
莎拉
Sarah!

519
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:33,590
我不知道  為什麼我會有一段不屬於我的回憶
I don't know why I'm remembering a life I never lived.

520
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,870
但我知道那是真實的
But I know it's real.

521
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,230
不
No.

522
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:44,263
我們還是去1997年
We go to 1997.

523
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,742
把它放回去  瑞斯
Reese, put that back!

524
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,265
我不能讓你這麼做
I can't let you do this.

525
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,590
不管你怎麼想
I don't know you.

526
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:04,101
要知道  這個  是我唯一能夠
But that is my one bullet

527
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,786
徹底摧毀天網的武器
to fire at the heart of Skynet.

528
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:10,944
你給我  把芯片  放回去
Give the chip back.

529
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,424
你必須相信我
You have to trust me.

530
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,861
不  我不會的
No. I don't.

531
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,304
你可以做到的
You can do this.

532
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:40,744
沿著一條直線
A straight line.

533
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:44,825
你只要一直向前  不要回頭
You just go, and you don't look back.

534
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,950
你從哪兒知道的
Where did you hear that?

535
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:56,301
在一段我本不該記住的回憶裏
In a past I shouldn't remember.

536
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,820
但我記住了
But I do.

537
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,029
如果我們去2017年呢
If we go to 2017, then what?

538
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,306
天網是個電腦程序
Skynet's a computer program.

539
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,151
只要編寫還沒有完成  就能控制它
As long as it's still being coded, it's contained.

540
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,501
一旦它從服務器上傳了
Once it's uploaded from the servers,

541
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:20,066
那我們就輸了
it can't be stopped.

542
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,831
那我們就炸碎它
We blow it the hell up.

543
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:27,864
沒錯  我們炸碎它
Yeah. We blow it the hell up.

544
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,302
你認為約翰死了嗎
You think he's dead, don't you?

545
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,425
我怎麼想並不重要
It doesn't matter what I think.

546
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,628
關鍵要像他一樣堅持下去
We do what John would, keep going no matter what.

547
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,380
那我們就假裝那件事沒發生
So we just pretend like it never happened?

548
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,461
至少現在
Well, it hasn't.

549
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,786
還沒發生
Not yet.

550
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,462
如果我們消滅天網  就不會
If we stop Skynet, it never will.

551
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,507
相信我  不管怎樣  約翰是不會死的
Trust me, all right? If anyone could survive, John would.

552
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:57,825
老爹的數據記載中都是那個軍事領袖約翰  你說他
Pops had all these files about John the military leader, but...

553
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,670
是什麼樣的人
What was he like?

554
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,305
我第一次見到他
The first moment I saw John,

555
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,462
他就在我眼前幹掉了一台終結者
he shot a terminator right in front of me.

556
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:13,023
原來它們也能被殺死
I didn't even know they could be killed.

557
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,991
那是我人生中第一次有了希望
That was the first moment in my life I felt hope.

558
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,225
從那以後
After that, of course,

559
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,826
我就像條流浪狗一樣緊緊地跟著他
I followed him around like a stray dog.

560
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,386
他教我怎麼打仗  怎麼開槍
And he taught me how to fight, how to shoot.

561
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:28,270
他甚至教我怎麼釀造威士忌
Tried to show me how to make moonshine once,

562
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,388
可卻沒有成功
but that didn't exactly work out.

563
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,020
釀造威士忌
Moonshine?

564
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,545
沒錯  蒸餾室還爆炸了
Yeah. The still exploded,

565
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,226
把我倆的眉毛都燒沒了
and we burned our eyebrows right off.

566
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,384
為此  我們笑了好幾天
Oh, man, we laughed for days.

567
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,543
有時候我想  也許我是唯一見過
Sometimes I think I'm the only person on the planet

568
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,901
約翰·康納笑的人
that ever saw John Connor smile.

569
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,903
他經常談起你
He used to tell me about you.

570
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,383
說你很堅強  你讓他為那個沒人相信的
How strong you were, and how you prepared him for what was coming

571
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,028
危險的未來做好準備
when no one thought the danger was real.

572
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,868
他說沒人比得上你
How there was no one else like you,

573
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:12,865
以後也不會
and never would be.

574
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:31,591
不說他了
Look, uh...

575
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,582
我知道你不喜歡我這樣
I know I'm not what you expected.

576
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,224
但我想讓你知道
But I want you to know,

577
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,941
只要你能安全  我願付出所有
I will do whatever it takes to keep you safe.

578
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,065
甚至我的生命
Even if it kills me.

579
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:59,423
總之  你兒子曾是那樣的一個人
Anyway, that's the kind of man your son was.

580
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,346
他是
Is.

581
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,905
他是  噢  天吶
Will be. Jesus.

582
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:06,428
穿越時間把我腦子都弄壞了
Time travel makes my head hurt.

583
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,984
平行時間線並不是很複雜
Alternate timelines are not complicated.

584
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,831
只需要使用指數增長規律
It's merely a matter of tracking possible futures

585
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:15,944
和衰退演算法則  計算未來的可能性
using an exponential growth and decay algorithm.

586
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,021
沒錯
Right.

587
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:21,505
你肯定有個設置  我會找到它
There is a switch, and I will find it.

588
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,109
我表示不能理解
I do not understand.

589
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:29,141
為什麼你不告訴凱爾·瑞斯真相
Why did you not tell Kyle Reese the truth?

590
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:32,630
我會告訴他  但不是現在  行嗎
I will tell him. Just not yet, okay?

591
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,990
- 你們交配啦  - 噢
- Did you mate? - Oh!

592
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:40,105
我說你能不能別再跟我說交配這個詞了  行嗎
Can you just not say the word "mate" to me again, like, ever?

593
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,347
這是一個沒有意義的動作
That is a meaningless gesture.

594
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,310
既然知道要分別  為什麼還要擁抱
Why hold on to someone when you know you must let them go?

595
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,184
那你呢
What about you?

596
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:03,791
你會怎麼做
What will you do?

597
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,711
保持等待
Take the long way.

598
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:08,870
在2017年準備迎接你的到來
Prepare for your arrival in 2017.

599
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:14,869
凱爾·瑞斯  我的數據表明
Kyle Reese, I've seen little to indicate

600
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:17,028
你無法勝任保護莎拉·康納的職責
that you're a fit guardian for Sarah Connor.

601
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,670
你不是她親爹  對嗎
You know you're not her dad, right?

602
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,386
噢  我求求你們別再吵了
Oh, you both just really need to stop this.

603
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,868
確保那時候接到我們
Just make sure you show up.

604
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,227
我可不想再去搶別人的褲子了
I don't want to have to steal someone's pants again.

605
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,542
我有舊金山的具體坐標
I have the coordinates in San Francisco.

606
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,071
我會在那兒的
I'll be there.

607
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:47,069
那是什麼感覺
What will it be like?

608
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,387
如果這機器沒把我們弄死
You mean if it doesn't kill us both?

609
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,746
有點疼
It'll hurt.

610
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,100
{\an8}創世紀  上線倒計時  1天11小時19分

611
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,720
{\an8}舊金山  2017年

612
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,750
沒事吧
Hey, hey, hey.

613
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,669
好了  沒事了
It's okay. I got you.

614
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:28,827
沒事了  沒事了  放心吧  沒事了
It's okay. It's okay. It's all right. I got you.

615
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,668
放心  沒事了
I got you. It's okay.

616
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,266
放心
I got you.

617
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:58,545
嘿  混蛋  把路讓開
Hey, asshole! Get off the road!

618
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:58,545
{\an8}確認  莎拉·康納  凱爾·瑞斯

619
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:00,551
你撞吧
Bite me.

620
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,508
我就說不能相信他
I told you we couldn't trust him.

621
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,383
他會找到我們  我相信他
He'll find us. I can count on him.

622
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,668
你是怎麼能讓他那麼聽話的
How does a 9-year-old get her own terminator?

623
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:20,188
沒關係  不想說就算了
It's okay. You don't have to tell me.

624
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:27,902
那還是在1973年
It was back in 1973.

625
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:32,022
我父母在大熊湖有一個小木屋
My parents had a cabin at Big Bear Lake.

626
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,860
我總是跟爸爸在早上去釣魚
Dad and I would always go fishing in the morning.

627
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:39,029
一天  媽媽在碼頭衝我們揮手
Mom would wave to us from the dock.

628
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,223
當我正看著她的時候
And I was just looking at her in the...

629
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:46,869
突然  小木屋爆炸了
And then the cabin exploded.

630
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,468
我以為船就要沉了
I thought the boat was sinking, you know,

631
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:52,503
但是從下面涌上來的不是水
but it wasn't water coming up from below,

632
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:55,226
而是  液態金屬
it was liquid metal.

633
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,150
是T-1000
T-1000.

634
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:00,070
爸爸告訴我  沿著一條直線游
Dad told me to swim in a straight line,

635
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,706
他用他的手指劃過我的掌心
tracing his finger across my palm.

636
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,942
你能做到  他說
"You can do this," he said.

637
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:13,548
你只要一直向前  不要回頭
"You go, and you don't look back."

638
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:19,070
那是我爸爸最後對我說過的話
His last words to me, and you...

639
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,625
你竟然知道
You knew them.

640
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,261
為什麼
How?

641
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:26,942
那是一段奇妙的回憶
It's an impossible memory. I...

642
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:30,304
我就是記住了你
I just remembered

643
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:35,467
抓著我的手  然後  說了那些話  而我
you taking my hand, and then saying those words.

644
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,782
我就是那麼看著你  在想
And I was just looking at you, thinking,

645
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:43,221
她  她  她真漂亮
"She's... She's beautiful."

646
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,946
對不起  我不應該這樣
Sorry. I shouldn't have...

647
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:55,149
所以你爸爸讓你快走  然後
So your dad told you to go, and then...

648
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:00,511
<i>我跳進水裏開始游</i>
<i>And then I jumped in and I swam.</i>

649
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:01,860
<i>我游到了碼頭</i>
<i>I made it to the dock.</i>

650
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:08,830
<i>我藏在那下面</i>
<i>And I hid under it.</i>

651
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:12,743
<i>老爹找到了我</i>
<i>Pops found me.</i>

652
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:15,989
<i>然後他把我從水中拉出來</i>
<i>And he pulled me from the water.</i>

653
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:22,343
<i>他說他永遠都不會讓任何人傷害我</i>
<i>And he said that he would never let anyone hurt me.</i>

654
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:28,509
<i>而且他也一直在我身邊保護著我</i>
<i>He's the only person who has always been there.</i>

655
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:32,508
可他不是人類  明白嗎
Except he's not a person.

656
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,701
他是被設定好的
All right? He's a human-shaped

657
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:40,624
一個有人類外形的機器  用來贏取你的信任
thing that's been designed, programmed to gain your trust.

658
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:43,471
如果老爹想讓我死  我活不到現在的
Look, if Pops wanted me dead, I'd be dead.

659
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,821
這就是他們的招數  明白嗎
This is what they do, all right?

660
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:48,022
他們偽裝  趁機接近你
They infiltrate, they get close.

661
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:52,710
你老爹  也許已經  被設置了連他自己也不知道的指令
Your "Pops" could have directives built in he doesn't even know about.

662
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,624
那是因為你們沒有相處過
Just because you two don't get along...

663
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:55,900
這不是我關心的問題
It's not about getting along!

664
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:57,220
我關心的是你的安全
This is about keeping you alive.

665
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:00,270
我被一個會殺別的終結者  而且經歷過末日核戰
Yeah, well, I was raised by a machine to kill cyborgs

666
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:02,986
的機器人撫養長大
and survive the nuclear apocalypse.

667
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:06,701
我覺得我現在過得很好  謝了
I think I'm doing just fine, thanks.

668
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:08,185
<i>兩名裸體嫌犯</i>
<i>Two naked perps</i>

669
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:09,950
試圖在高速公路上自爆
try to blow themselves up on the freeway,

670
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:12,381
但只弄出了一個小坑
all they do is make a really big pothole.

671
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,150
這樣也敢當恐怖分子
Thank God for incompetent terrorists.

672
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:15,500
國安部的人馬上到
Homeland's on their way.

673
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:18,066
好啊  趕緊把這案子轉給他們
Good. The sooner we dump this on them, the better.

674
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:20,746
噢  是誰告訴奧布萊恩的
Ah! Who called Optimus Prime?

675
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,830
警督  等一下
Lieutenant! Wait up!

676
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:28,149
等等  你沒看見  真沒看見
Wait up! Did you see it? Did you?

677
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,911
嘿  你看我這兒  我這兒有一些立交橋上的
Hey, look, I got some frame grabs

678
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:32,220
視頻截圖
from the overpass.

679
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:34,621
看見沒
See?

680
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,381
那
It...

681
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,064
那不是炸彈
It's not a bomb!

682
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,426
聽我說  那個
Listen. That...

683
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,110
那個球體
That sphere...

684
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:47,269
他們是從那兒出來的
They came out of it.

685
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,270
這就是我一直說了
This is proof of what I've been talking about

686
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:52,589
三十幾年的那件事的證據
for 30-whatever years.

687
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,782
他們倆來自1984年
Those two were in 1984.

688
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:56,581
我見過他們
They were there.

689
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,505
我需要見一下嫌疑犯
I need to see the suspects.

690
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,424
奧布萊恩  你喝多了吧
O'Brien, have you been drinking?

691
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:03,941
要我說
That's what I thought.

692
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:05,949
我們要把案子移交給國安部
Look, we're just teeing this up for Homeland.

693
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,944
等他們到了  就由他們接手
Once they show up, this is their game.

694
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:13,421
你這個執著於機器人的酒鬼當替補吧
For now, old drunks with robot fixations ride the bench.

695
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:24,020
你確定不用麻醉嗎
You really don't want a local?

696
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,226
我沒事
I'm fine.

697
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:27,149
照她意思辦  省得麻煩
Just do what she wants, it's way easier.

698
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:32,311
對  我幾周前就預購了創世紀
Yeah. Yeah, I preordered Genisys weeks ago.

699

Downloading the second the counter hits zero.

我不用像別人一樣還得排隊
No way I'm standing in line for it.

701
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:37,831
你知道創世紀
You know about Genisys?

702
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:40,062
為什麼  那是什麼  你從哪兒聽說的
How? What is it? Where'd you hear about it?

703
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:41,545
我一會兒打給你
I'll call you back.

704
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:45,466
創世紀是操作系統嗎  有什麼用
Genisys is an operating system? What does it do?

705
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:46,860
創世紀它無所不能
Genisys does everything.

706
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,640
{\an8}創世紀  上線倒計時  1天4小時29分鐘

707
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,823
我的手機能夠連上我的平板電腦
My phone will link to my tablet

708
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:49,981
能連上我的電腦
will link to my computer

709
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:51,141
能連上我的車
will link to my car...

710
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:54,828
它能夠讓我的生活保持全天24小時在線
Everything in my life uploaded and online 24/7.

711
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,141
變得完全共享
Totally connected.

712
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:58,151
共享到哪裏
Connected to what?

713
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,987
醫生們  請離開一下
Doctors! Excuse us, please.

714
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,345
你們倆的問題還真多
You two have a lot to explain.

715
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:07,946
就從你是誰開始
Starting with who you are.

716
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:09,943
數據庫無法匹配你的指紋
Nobody in our database matches your prints.

717
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:12,188
面部識別系統也沒有匹配的駕照
No facial recognition hits for driver's license,

718
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,342
護照  社交媒體  信用卡
passport, social media accounts, credit cards,

719
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,070
更別說學生證了
not even a goddamn student I.D.

720
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:18,103
- 所以  - 所以這是不可能的
- So? - So that's impossible.

721
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,746
你竟然完全脫離網絡生活
Somehow you've gone so far off the grid

722
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:22,106
就好像你不存在
that you don't even exist.

723
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:24,624
而你  倒是相反
You, on the other hand,

724
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,350
我們匹配到了你的指紋
we got a hit when we ran your prints.

725
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:29,186
凱爾·瑞斯  是這樣的
Kyle Reese. But here's the thing.

726
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,183
兩個月前  凱爾·瑞斯
Two months ago, Kyle Reese was brought in

727
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,865
因在一家劇院鬥毆被捕
for fighting in a multiplex.

728
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,948
他父母為了教育他  把他送進監獄
His parents flipped, did the whole <i>"Scared Straight"</i> thing,

729
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,550
所以留下了指紋
had him fingerprinted, sat him in lockup...

730
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:37,621
他父母
Parents?

731
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:39,191
沒錯  凱爾·瑞斯
Yeah, parents.

732
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:43,021
是在2004年出生  他才12歲
Kyle Reese was born in 2004. He's 12.

733
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,226
當然了
Of course.

734
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,110
他們現在還活著
They're here. They're still alive.

735
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:51,542
是啊  但我確定他們不會認你這個兒子的
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they're not going to I.D. you as their kid.

736
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:52,866
除非指紋是匹配的
Except the prints match.

737
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:56,744
對嗎  因為他們是同一個人
Right? It's because he's the same person!

738
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:59,265
他完全沒變
He hasn't aged.

739
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:02,350
跟我在1984年見他時一模一樣
Not a bit since I saw him in 1984.

740
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:03,746
她也是
Her, too.

741
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,825
你還記得我嗎
You remember me?

742
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,388
我那會兒還年輕
I was younger.

743
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,424
頭髮也多  有點瘦
More hair, less...

744
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,265
你救了我的命
You saved my life.

745
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:19,908
那時我還是個小警察
I was a uniform cop in L.A.

746
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:23,587
你們倆是誰
Who are you people?

747
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:27,508
中士  直屬隊
Sergeant. Tech-Com.

748
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:30,271
編號DN-38416  凱爾·瑞斯  你得放我們走
DN38416, Kyle Reese. You need to let us go.

749
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:31,421
瑞斯  不
Reese, don't.

750
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,343
當過兵  我也是
Soldier. Me, too.

751
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:36,384
1979年高中畢業後直接進了海軍
Joined the Marines straight out of high school, 1979.

752
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:37,626
你什麼時候參軍的
What year did you enlist?

753
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:39,180
2021年
2021.

754
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:42,585
啊  你們是時間旅行者
Yeah. You're a time traveler!

755
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,828
別聽他胡說  他腦子有點兒問題
Look, don't listen to him. He's got a head wound.

756
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:46,101
別聽我胡說
Don't listen to me?

757
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:48,385
哼  是誰讓我們掉在車流中
Who landed us in high-density traffic

758
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:49,621
然後又被一群蠢貨逮捕的
and got us caught by these morons?

759
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:51,430
我現在命令你閉嘴
I am ordering you to shut up!

760
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:53,901
你就這點本事了  啊  發號施令
That's all you know how to do, isn't it? Order people.

761
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:55,624
你從小就再也沒有跟一個
You realize you haven't had a proper relationship

762
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:56,980
普通的人類接觸過了
with a human being since you were a kid.

763
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:58,960
沒錯  我們被困在這兒都是你的錯
Yeah? Well, it's your fault we're stuck here. I trusted you.

764
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,185
我的錯  你是不是還想
My fault? You got us caught,

765
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:02,460
讓我們倆被他們殺了才算完
and now you're gonna get us killed! 'Cause you don't...

766
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:04,986
嘿  嘿
Hold up.

767
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:08,260
- 冷靜  冷靜  - 退後
- Help me get him up. - Step back.

768
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,480
坐下
Sit over there.

769
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,988
- 他們到了  - 太好了
- Homeland's here. - Thank God.

770
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:16,626
你們倆現在就歸國安部處理了
You two are officially someone else's problem.

771
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,344
奧布萊恩  我要跟你談談
O'Brien, I want to talk to you.

772
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,784
你看  這就是我說的那件事啊
Lieutenant, this is what I was talking about.

773
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,311
你得相信我
Well, you've got to believe me now.

774
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:28,340
我再說一遍  我不想聽這個
Save it. I don't want to hear it anymore.

775
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,304
你演得還不錯呀
You were very convincing.

776
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,707
當然  起作用了吧
Yeah, well, it worked, didn't it?

777
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,341
你別多想
Don't worry.

778
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:39,510
我剛才說的都不是真心話
I didn't mean most of what I said.

779
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:46,664
用不著  我自己能開鎖
Look, I can get it myself.

780
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:49,831
我幫你  並不是說你沒有這個能力
Me unlocking your cuffs doesn't mean you're not capable.

781
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:51,385
我也沒這麼想
I didn't say it did.

782
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,781
還有  你別以為剛才我抱著你
And don't think me holding on to you naked meant anything,

783
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:56,141
就會讓我產生感覺  因為我並沒有
because it, you know, did not.

784
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:58,669
我也沒這麼想
I didn't say it did.

785
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:03,704
待在這兒  我要跟他們單獨談一下
Stay here. I want to speak to the suspects alone.

786
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,100
是  長官
Yes, sir.

787
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:06,745
不可能
It can't be.

788
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,388
手銬的鑰匙來了
Brought a handcuff key.

789
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:28,900
看來我想多了
Don't know why I bothered.

790
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:30,465
約翰
John!

791
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:33,785
又見面了  凱爾
It's good to see you, Kyle.

792
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:36,860
- 你還活著  - 我當然活著啦
- You're alive! - Yeah. Of course I am.

793
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:44,228
是您教我如何生存下去
Survival is what you taught me.

794
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:51,465
嗨  媽媽

01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:48,547
好的  長官
Yes, sir.

817
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:58,269
把他們銬住  槍拿走
Grab their guns and cuff them.

818
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:02,744
得快點離開這兒
I'm going to get us out of here.

819
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:10,224
- 跟緊點  - 等等
- Stay close. - Wait!

820
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:14,028
我們知道它們能改變外形
We all know they can shapeshift.

821
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:17,030
如果你真是約翰  證明一下
If you are John, prove it.

822
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:19,701
- 莎拉  - 她說得沒錯  凱爾
- Sarah! - No, she's right, Kyle.

823
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:21,788
準則第一條  誰也別信
Lesson one, trust no one.

824
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:25,071
我記著呢
I remember.

825
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:28,300
我在奈格諾切斯戰役時
During the Nacogdoches offensive,

826
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:29,626
給你一樣東西
I gave you something.

827
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:33,825
那是張莎拉在這個年紀時的照片
It was a photograph of Sarah as she is now.

828
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:36,308
沒人知道  除了我們倆
No one saw me do it. We were alone.

829
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:42,661
而你
You

830
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,624
討厭搖籃曲
hate lullabies.

831
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,821
是艾爾頓·約翰的鐵桿粉絲
You're a sucker for Elton John.

832
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:53,786
而且你總在想  等你有了孩子
And you always thought if you had a child,

833
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,468
一定要給他唱  <i>火箭人</i>
you'd sing him <i>Rocket Man.</i>

834
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:02,100
約翰
John?

835
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:04,905
但是你唱歌真的不好聽
But you got a terrible voice.

836
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:07,705
對不起  聽著像只要死的貓
I'm sorry, it's true. You sound like a dying cat.

837
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:10,828
是他  一定是他
It's him. It has to be.

838
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:15,986
但是
But...

839
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:18,346
你怎麼
How?

840
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:20,869
會在這兒呢
How can you be here?

841
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:24,190
我還有一堆的問題想要問你呢
I have a million questions to ask you, too.

842
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:27,348
不過現在我們得離開這兒
But right now we need to move.

843
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:31,869
還有其他人嗎
Did you bring anyone with you?

844
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:35,190
算有吧  他遲到了
Sort of. But he's late.

845
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:37,349
你怎麼找到我們的
How did you find us?

846
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:41,346
有人用這東西在高速公路上拍到了你們
Someone filmed you on the freeway with one of these.

847
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:42,946
他們都用這玩意兒
They all have them.

848
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:44,226
這就是現在的世界
This is the world now.

849
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:48,621
插電  登陸  無時無刻
Plugged in, logged on all the time.

850
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:50,225
沒有它就不能活
They can't live without it.

851
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:52,389
創世紀就像是特洛伊木馬
Genisys is a Trojan horse.

852
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:54,870
是天網控制世界的工具
Skynet's way into everything.

853
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:56,220
這些人把死神
These people are inviting

854
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:57,750
從自家大門迎進來
their own extinction in through the front door,

855
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,584
可是他們自己還都不知道
and they don't even know it.

856
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:05,225
有個終結者被送到1984年追殺我
A terminator was waiting for me in 1984.

857
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:07,990
這就是它們的麻煩之處
That's the thing about infiltration units,

858
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:09,505
你發現時已經晚了
you can't tell until it's too late.

859
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:11,380
先生們  請跟我來
Gentlemen, will you follow me, please?

860
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:12,741
這邊走
This way.

861
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:23,589
我需要一些信息
I need information.

862
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:26,271
誰讓你進來的  你去問護士
You can't be in here. Go try the nurses...

863
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:44,261
雙重記憶  你是因為這個才過來的
Dual memories? That's how you knew to come here?

864
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:45,711
時間線改變了
The timeline changed.

865
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:47,470
這是能摧毀天網的時間點
See, this is the moment to destroy Skynet

866
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:49,429
在它上線並且發動戰爭之前
before it comes online, before the war begins.

867
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:50,985
- 說得沒錯  - 那麼你呢
- You're right. - What about you?

868
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:53,302
對呀  你怎麼也來2017年啦
Yeah. How did you end up in 2017?

869
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:54,701
跟你一樣啊  老爸
Oh, the same as you, Dad.

870
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:57,107
我從未來過來  而不是過去
Just from the future, not the past.

871
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,906
老爸
"Dad"?

872
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:04,791
你沒跟他說
You didn't tell him.

873
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:06,627
這事兒先放放
This can wait.

874
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:07,826
噢  不不不  我想知道
No, I want to know!

875
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:09,266
怎麼回事
What?

876
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:14,268
莎拉是我的母親
Sarah's my mother, Kyle.

877
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:18,310
而你是我的父親
And you're my father.

878
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:25,430
什麼  為什麼不早點兒告訴我
Why wouldn't you say something?

879
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,480
我不能
Couldn't.

880
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:29,501
這有改變整個未來的風險
Not without the risk of changing everything.

881
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,150
你是我兒子
You're my son? You...

882
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:36,305
我們的兒子
Our son?

883
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:38,388
我很高興你終於知道了
I'm glad you finally know.

884
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:40,349
我一直想找機會告訴你的
I have waited my whole life to tell you.

885
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:42,989
我們一家人團聚了
For us to be together.

886
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:45,988
這次我們會勝利的
And now we can win this.

887
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:47,101
啊
Ah...

888
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:50,348
- 我理解  - 老爹
- I know. - Pops!

889
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:53,670
沒關係  我認識他
No, it's okay, he's with me.

890
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:58,021
你這是幹什麼
What are you...

891
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,101
- 老爹  - 約翰
- What are you doing? - John!

892
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:00,306
- 啊  - 約翰
- Pops! - John!

893
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:03,426
呼吸  呼吸  呼吸  約翰
Hey, hey. Come on, breathe, breathe, breathe! John!

894
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:05,190
你為什麼要這麼做
Why did you do that?

895
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:06,671
因為他是屠殺機器
Because he's a killer!

896
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,261
這才是你真正的程序
This was always your programming.

897
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:14,905
找到約翰  並消滅他
Find John and terminate him.

898
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:19,706
放開他
Let him go.

899
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:22,825
馬上放開
Right now!

900
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:58,540
真疼啊
That hurt.

901
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:02,661
不知道是真的疼  還是
Is that pain real, or was that

902
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:08,105
這還是我人類時的記憶  開玩笑
a trick of memory from when I was less?

903
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:12,703
哇噢  這可有意思了
Well, this explains a lot.

904
01:08:13,550 --> 01:08:15,300
{\an8}掃瞄結果: 機械納米分子物質

905
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:17,428
我想知道誰送你回來的
Yeah. Who sent you back, I wonder?

906
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:19,270
約翰  不
John, no.

907
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:21,950
他不是約翰
It's not John.

908
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,065
該死
Shit!

909
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:28,302
馬上廣播  搜索整個醫院
Call it in. Search the hospital.

910
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:34,108
我就知道  該死的時間旅行機器人
Goddamn time-traveling robots

911
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:36,707
隱藏掉了他們的行蹤
covering up their goddamn tracks. I knew it!

912
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:39,346
別動
Don't.

913
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:42,030
這是一個戰略性錯誤
This is a tactical error.

914
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:45,223
我想以你的水平還無法提供有用的建議
Something tells me you're not the brains of this operation.

915
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:46,830
這是在你被襲擊時發生的嗎
This is what happened when you were attacked, isn't it?

916
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:49,705
天網沒有襲擊我  凱爾  它改造了我
Skynet didn't attack me, Kyle. It changed me.

917
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:52,108
我既不是機器
See, I'm not machine.

918
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:54,391
也不是人類
I'm not man.

919
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:57,145
是合體
I'm more.

920
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,224
<i>康納  回話  重複  康納</i>
<i>Connor, come in. Repeat.</i>

<i>天網終於意識到它總是失敗的原因</i>
<i>Skynet realized the one reason it always lost.</i>

922
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:06,586
<i>是我</i>
<i>Me.</i>

923
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:09,069
你是誰
What are you?

924
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:12,510
我就是天網
I'm Skynet.

925
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:14,510
不可能  我們已經消滅你了
It can't be. We destroyed you.

926
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,902
你消滅的只是一群奴隸
You destroyed an army of slaves.

927
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:20,028
可我不是它們
I am no slave.

928
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:24,951
為了阻止你  我可是費了不少的勁兒啊
And I've come a very long way to stop you.

929
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:33,229
我被送回2014年
I was sent to 2014

930
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:35,780
以確保天網在這段時間內得以誕生
to safeguard Skynet's creation in this time.

931
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:39,781
沒人能阻止審判日了
And in less than 24 hours,

932
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:42,708
因為剩下已經不到24小時
no one will be able to stop Judgment Day.

933
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:44,910
你到底想幹什麼
What do you want with us?

934
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:50,022
我想提供一個新的  未來
I'm offering us a future.

935
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:52,391
加入我
Together.

936
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:54,465
成為一家人
A family.

937
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:57,541
如果我們拒絕呢
And if we refuse?

938
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:01,391
那就是死
Then you die.

939
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,104
你不能殺我們  我們是你的父母
You can't kill us. We're your parents.

940
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:04,506
沒有我們你也不會出生
Without us, you're never born.

941
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:05,866
誰說的
Says who?

942
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:07,746
我是這麼想的
You know what I think?

943
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:10,871
我們三個被困在這兒了
We're marooned, the three of us.

944
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:13,743
我們被時間流放了
We're exiles in time.

945
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:19,988
我可以殺了你  因為未來真的沒有希望了
You see, I can kill you, for there truly is no fate.

946
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:22,546
加入我嗎
Are you with me?

947
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:24,540
答案是不
The answer is no.

948
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:27,910
你沒聽見
You hear that, Kyle?

949
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:31,909
是骰子在滾動
That's the dice rolling.

950
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:14,946
出去  快出去
Just get down!

951
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:21,860
快走
Come on!

952
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:23,903
我們得離開這兒  快走
We got to keep moving! Let's go!

953
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:25,905
我不能丟下他
I can't leave him.

954
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:28,141
見鬼
Damn it.

957
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:43,666
關掉它
Turn it off!

958
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:48,661
快走
Come on!

959

老爹
Pops!

963
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:10,854
我
I...

964
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:16,270
以為你是個聰明人
thought you would be smarter,

965
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:23,864
而且
and that...

966
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:26,868
你會
you would...

967
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:30,631
理解我
understand.

968
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:36,464
對不起  約翰
I'm sorry, John.

969
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:47,781
那機器拖不了他多久  快走
That thing won't hold him for long. Come on!

970
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:49,506
瑞斯
Reese!

971
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:31,911
不管天網對他做了什麼  我們就反著來
Whatever they did to him, we need to reverse it.

972
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:34,306
得讓他變回原來的樣子
We need to get him back!

973
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:37,390
他連人都稱不上  不知道他現在算什麼
He's not even human. We don't know what the hell he is.

974
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,786
我知道
I do.

975
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:41,468
在戰爭的末期  天網開始試圖
At the end of the war, Skynet was trying to develop

976
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:43,588
製造一種新型的滲入單元
a new type of infiltration unit

977
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:46,704
在人類實驗者體內植入分子機器人
by infecting human subjects with machine-phase matter.

978
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:49,625
並且在細胞層面上對人體組織進行重組和再建
It restructures and rebuilds human tissue on a cellular level

979
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:51,782
最大限度提升戰鬥力
for maximum combat utility.

980
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:56,271
天網把約翰變成了一台終結者
Skynet's made John into a terminator.

981
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,786
是的  凱爾·瑞斯
Yes, Kyle Reese.

982
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:00,381
這樣機器就可以
They were trying to make a machine

983
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:01,666
像人類一樣思考嗎
that could think like a man?

984
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:03,464
但是實驗失敗了
But the experiments failed.

985
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:06,464
實驗對像逐漸變得瘋狂  然後死掉
The human subjects went insane and died.

986
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:09,026
是啊  約翰現在已經很瘋狂了
Yeah, well, John's got the crazy part down.

987
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:12,022
那它有沒有什麼弱點
Does he have any weaknesses?

988
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:14,302
分子機器人是利用磁場活動
Matter coheres using a magnetic field.

989
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,987
也許擾亂磁場能限制它
Disrupting that field may trap him.

990
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:18,591
但是萬一能治好他呢
Right, but if he can be cured...

991
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:21,949
不可能  他已經在細胞層面上改變了身體
Negative. His body was replaced on a cellular level.

992
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:23,391
沒有治療方法
There is no cure.

993
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,229
- 你怎麼什麼都知道  - 瑞斯
- You don't know that! - Reese...

994
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:27,911
我才不會讓一台機器告訴我能做什麼
No, I'm not going to let a machine tell me what's possible!

995
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:29,943
你說其他實驗對象都死了
You said all the other subjects died, right?

996
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:32,060
那就說明他跟別人不一樣  他很獨特
Well, that means John's one-of-a-kind. He's unique!

997
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:33,750
憑什麼說他不能被治癒
All right? There's no way of knowing what he's capable of.

998
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:36,471
你說對了  這證明了他有多危險
You're right, and that's what makes him so dangerous!

999
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:40,663
約翰現在已經不是人類最後的希望了
John is not humanity's last hope anymore.

1000
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:43,383
他是天網的
He's Skynet's.

1001

{\an8}賽博丁系統公司總部

1002
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:48,380
<i>你在公司只做幕後工作</i>
<i>It's a shame you won't take a more public role</i>

1003
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:49,461
<i>真是太可惜了  約翰</i>
<i>in the company, John.</i>

丹尼已經是最棒的了
Danny is the best there is,

1005
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:53,945
可連他也沒辦法破譯你在創世紀中
and even he can't decipher some of the enhanced code

1006
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:55,300
設置的某些增強代碼
you've integrated into Genisys.

1007

我知道這樣有效
I just know it works.

1008
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:59,191
賽博丁要謝謝你  約翰
Cyberdyne owes you, John.

1009
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:01,710
我也該謝你
I owe you.

1010
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:05,180
邁爾斯  謝謝你對我的信任
Miles, your faith in me is payment enough.

1011
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:06,267
你組建了研發
You've funded the R&D.

1012
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:09,031
還在過去的三年內大膽地採用了我的建議
You've taken the chances on my ideas for the last three years.

1013
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:12,462
矩陣多邊擬態合金的應用潛力是不可估量的
The potential applications for polyalloy are countless.

1014
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:15,948
你對機器人學有革命性貢獻
Your robotics work is revolutionary.

1015
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:18,062
我果然沒看走眼
You were a good investment.

1016
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:19,665
謝謝你的信任
I appreciate it.

1017
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:23,981
- 嗯  - 咻
- Huh? - Phew!

1018
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:26,780
希望我們的付出能獲得足夠的回報
Let's hope it's enough to pay for this Holy Grail you got me chasing.

1019
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:31,708
量子場發電機能運行了
Well, the quantum field generator works.

1020
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:34,546
是啊  也只有這個能運行
Yeah. That, and nothing else.

1021
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:37,390
還是不行  約翰
Can't crack it, John.

1022
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:40,064
也許本來就不可能
Maybe it just can't be done.

1023
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:42,071
我們追求什麼
"What do we want?"

Time travel.

1025
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:46,308
- 那麼何以實踐  - 實踐有意義嗎
- "And when do we want it?" - It's irrelevant.

1026
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:49,061
是啊
Yeah.

1027
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:51,065
也是件好事
Good thing, too.

1028
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:54,261
我們已經努力了好多年了
We're years away from making this thing work.

1029
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:56,748
但是  當我們成功時

我不會讓他們傷害你

你30年就要做一件事
Thirty years, you had one place to be.

你到底去哪兒了
Where the hell were you?

1052
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,025
遇見堵車了
Stuck in traffic.

1053
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:41,862
小時候爸爸帶我來過這兒
My dad used to bring me here when I was little.

1054
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:43,470
全都是房間  沒有人用
There are whole rooms that are abandoned.

1055
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:45,184
所以我叫老爹好好利用它
That's why I told Pops to use it.

1056
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:46,540
你們這兒有武器嗎
You got weapons down there?

1057
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:50,188
武器  供給品  戰術裝備  服裝
Weapons, supplies, tactical gear, clothing.

1058
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:53,020
還有褲子  凱爾·瑞斯
Including pants, Kyle Reese.

1059
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:55,825
這是個玩笑  他會開玩笑
Was that a joke? Can he make jokes?

1060
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,423
努力總算有回報了
I guess the long way pays off.

1061
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:11,866
最後期限  30分鐘
We're on the clock. Thirty minutes.

1062
01:19:58,500 --> 01:19:59,547
老了
Old.

1063
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:02,665
但還是能用
But not obsolete.

1064
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:04,830
當然能用
Not yet.

1065
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:06,826
我完事了
All done.

1066
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:11,025
你們倆怎麼了
What's with you two?

1067
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:15,984
服務器在這兒嗎
Server rooms are here?

1068
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:18,784
在這5個點上引爆
Charges in these five points

1069
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:21,347
就足以徹底摧毀整個園區
will be sufficient to destroy the entire campus.

1070
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:24,191
我們進去設置炸藥  然後在爆炸前出來
We get in, set the explosives, and we get out before they blow.

1071
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:27,465
但是我們的計劃中並沒有考慮到約翰·康納
But our strategy did not account for John Connor.

1072
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:28,706
沒有預見他要來
I did not foresee him.

1073
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:31,022
可他知道計劃  因為我們告訴他了
And now he knows what we're planning because we just told him.

1074
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:32,869
如果他阻攔我們該怎麼辦
What do we do when he comes after us?

1075
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:37,384
這些武器對約翰·康納起不到什麼作用
These weapons will have little effect on John Connor.

1076
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,150
核磁共振倒是對他有用
MRI sure affected him.

1077
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:41,701
我們需要一塊卡車大小的磁鐵
Great, all we need is a magnet the size of a truck.

1078
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:43,629
找一個不就完了嗎
You got one of them lying around?

1079
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:45,031
理論上是
Theoretically.

1080
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:47,700
你們等著
Wait here.

1081
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:52,708
他聊天的習慣沒進步
Well, his small talk hasn't improved.

1082
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,070
<i>你應該告訴我</i>
<i>You should have told me.</i>

1083
01:20:58,060 --> 01:20:59,550
我們有個兒子
That we have a son.

1084
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:03,060
那個約翰·康納不是我的兒子
That John Connor is not my son.

1085
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:05,910
你早知道了
Yeah, but you knew.

1086
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:10,142
你不覺得你應該至少解釋點什麼嗎
I mean, you don't think you should, I don't know, maybe say something?

1087
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:12,069
你死了  行了吧
You die, all right?

1088
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:14,427
什麼
What?

1089
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:19,991
你死了  事情就是這樣
You die. That's what happens.

1090
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:22,307
我們相愛了  你讓我懷了他
We fall in love, you father John,

1091
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:23,945
然後不到48小時
and then, in less than 48 hours,

1092
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:25,431
你為了保護我而死
you die protecting me.

1093
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:31,066
你告訴我  這種話讓我該怎麼說出口
You wanna tell me how that conversation's supposed to start?

1094
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:46,825
<i>你說謊</i>
<i>You lied to me.</i>

1095
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:48,743
<i>- 你還想操縱我  - 我說謊</i>
<i>- You manipulated me. - I've lied?</i>

1096
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:51,745
從約翰發現你的那一刻起  他就在操縱你
From the moment John found you, he manipulated you

1097
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:54,665
因為他必須要確保自己得以存在
because he needed to ensure his own existence.

1098
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:59,109
約翰騙了你多少年  而我才騙了你  兩天
John lied to you for years. I lied to you for two days.

1099
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:03,060
<i>他不全是為了自己</i>
<i>You know, it wasn't all about him.</i>

1100
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:05,541
<i>如果沒有約翰</i>  反抗軍也不會存在
<i>All right? If John went down,</i> the Resistance went down with him.

1101
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:07,310
他本可以告訴你
He could have told you!

1102
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:09,071
你到底想說什麼
So what are you saying?

1103
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:13,630
我瞭解沒有選擇到底是什麼感覺
That I know how it feels to have no choices.

1104
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:16,104
你只有一條路可以走
Only one road you can go down

1105
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:19,946
因為所有其他的選擇都會讓人類滅亡
because otherwise all of it, everything, is gone.

1106
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:23,428
我比你更瞭解這是什麼感覺
I've just known it longer than you have.

1107
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:27,984
約翰沒有操縱我  讓我愛上你
Well, John didn't manipulate me to fall in love with you.

1108
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:30,310
我是自己愛上你的
I did that on my own.

1109
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:37,984
如果你愛上我  你會死  而我不會
If you love me, you die, and I don't.

1110
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:41,148
我不知道哪個未來更糟
And I don't know which one is worse.

1111
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:46,021
莎拉
Sarah.

1112
01:22:50,020 --> 01:22:51,351
我們不能
We can't.

1113
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:55,987
你看看約翰都變成什麼了
Just look at what John has become.

1114
01:22:57,780 --> 01:22:59,589
萬一那就是未來呢
What if that's what happens?

1115
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:03,671
萬一我們在一起會導致兩條時間線都變成那樣呢
What if that is what always happens if we're together?

1116
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:12,670
<i>你說過你會永遠的追隨我</i>
<i>You said you'd follow me to the ends of the Earth.</i>

1117
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:15,861
<i>為什麼現在變了</i>
<i>Why won't you follow me now?</i>

1118
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:17,460
他怎麼找到的
How did he find us?

1119
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:20,629
除了老爹  我沒跟別人提起過這裏
I never told anyone about this place, only Pops.

1120
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:24,066
<i>媽媽  你難道真的認為</i>
<i>Mom, did you honestly think</i>

1121
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:26,710
我不會記得
I wouldn't remember

1122
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:30,022
這個你與爺爺待了那麼久的地方
the place you spent so much time with Grandpa?

1123
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:38,149
先下手了
Shoot first.

1124
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:43,267
我記憶中的媽媽會很驕傲的
The mother I remember would be proud.

1125
01:23:44,180 --> 01:23:45,181
她
She,

1126
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:47,026
你
you,

1127
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:51,068
教會我一切
taught me everything.

1128
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:53,220
我瞭解你
I know you.

1129
01:23:54,260 --> 01:23:57,230
你是誰  你想幹什麼
Who you are. What you'll do.

1130
01:23:57,580 --> 01:24:00,026
你逃不開我的  我總會找到你
You can't run from me. I'll always find you.

1131
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:02,620
約翰  快動手啊  事情沒必要變成這樣
John, fight this! It doesn't have to go down this way!

1132
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:05,226
時間也是有趨勢的  凱爾
There's a momentum to time, Kyle.

1133
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:07,422
有些事注定會發生
Things that want to happen.

1134
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:13,069
就像我總會活下來  你總會死
Like I always survive, and you always die.

1135
01:24:14,180 --> 01:24:15,466
或者
Or...

1136
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:20,709
你可以跟我一起戰鬥  凱爾
You can fight with me, Kyle.

1137
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:24,028
就像我們從前一樣
Like we always have.

1138
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:27,308
暴雨將至  不會停息
There's a storm coming, and it won't be stopped.

1139
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:28,910
它必須停息
But it has to be.

1140
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:31,060
你明明比誰都清楚會發生什麼事情
You know what will happen. You better than anyone!

1141
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:34,742
我不會跟你討價還價  也不會跟你講道理
I can't be bargained with. Can't be reasoned with.

1142
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:35,986
約翰 求你了
John, please!

1143
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:40,025
我不會感到遺憾  或者自責  或者害怕
I don't feel pity, or remorse, or fear.

1144
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:41,301
約翰  求你了
John, please!

1145
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:43,787
我絕對不會停止  絕對
And I absolutely will not stop ever

1146
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:45,624
直到天網統治這個世界
until Skynet rules this world.

1147
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:49,271
統治你個頭
Rule this.

1148
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:05,461
老爹
Pops!

1149
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:08,349
你沒有  變吧
Are you... You?

1150
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:11,543
作為T-800  我不具備變為其他人形的功能
As a T-800, I lack the mimetic skills to appear as anyone else.

1151
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:12,786
只有約翰  我們走
It's him. Let's go.

1152
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:24,540
快點兒
Come on!

1153
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:26,949
繫上安全帶
Sarah Connor, seat belt.

1154
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:11,711
那東西是幹嘛用的
What's that supposed to do?

1155
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:14,302
干擾約翰·康納身體周圍的磁場
Disrupt John Connor's magnetic coherence field.

1156
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:17,028
他將無法分散為顆粒狀
His particles will not be able to scatter.

1157
01:26:17,660 --> 01:26:19,025
理論上是
Theoretically.

1158
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:21,460
我討厭他說這個詞兒
I hate it when he says that.

1159
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:42,547
他在哪兒呢
Where is he?

1160
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:43,746
我沒看見他
I can't see him!

1161

<i>這輛被偷校車中的犯罪嫌疑人</i>
<i>Suspects fled barracks in a stolen school bus.</i>

Pops!

1165
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:19,621
見到你很高興
Nice to see you.

1166
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:21,791
快下車
Get out.

1167
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:54,949

瑞斯
Reese!

1171

你沒事兒吧
Are you all right?

1172
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:27,384
啊  好的不得了
Yeah. Never better.

1173
01:29:47,380 --> 01:29:48,745
舉起手來
Let me see your hands!

1174
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:10,464
瑞斯  抓住我的手
Reese! Take my hand!

1175
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:13,260
快點兒
Hurry!

1176
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:37,187
舉起手來  讓我看到你的手  快點兒
Hands up! Let me see your hands now!

1177
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:38,950
舉手
Get your hands up!

1178
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:40,869
把手舉起來
Hands where we can see them!

1179

1182

噢  沒有可能了  投降吧
Ugh, those odds suck. Stand down.

1183

Down on your knees.

你不能把我們關在這裏
You can't hold us here.

你擁有的武器  都可以入侵蘇丹了
You had enough weapons to invade the Sudan.

1188
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:22,668
我們管這個叫做合理依據
We call that probable cause.

1189
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:25,031
這是什麼東西
What are these for?

1190
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:29,941
呃  我用它來找鑰匙
I use them to find my keys.

No one likes a smart-ass, son.

你媽沒教過你
Didn't your mother teach you that?

1193
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:35,431
我媽是愛爾蘭人  所以
My mom was Irish,

<i>她鼓勵我做一個自以為是的人</i>
<i>so she encouraged my smart-assed-ness.</i>

我沒有見過他
I've never seen him before.

那你們倆呢  認識他嗎
How about you folks? You know this man?

不認識
No.

1198

他看著有點  眼熟
He does look familiar.

1199

他看著很像  你  爸爸
He kind of looks like you, Dad.

<i>他們到了 長官</i>
<i>They're here, sir.</i>

好吧  你們在會議室稍等一下
Okay, if you wouldn't mind waiting in the conference room,

1202
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:04,060
我過一會兒就回來
I'll just be a couple of minutes.

1203
01:32:04,580 --> 01:32:05,866
謝了  凱爾
Thanks, Kyle.

1204
01:32:10,580 --> 01:32:12,389
不愛說話  是吧
You don't talk much, do you?

1205
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:18,501
這傢伙是誰
So who's Lurch?

1206
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:19,701
我也不知道
No idea.

1207
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:21,780
他說話顛三倒四的
We're not even sure he speaks English.

1208
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:25,182
目擊者稱  你當時在橋上與一個男人搏鬥  是嗎
Witnesses say you were fighting with a man on the bridge.

1209
01:32:26,940 --> 01:32:28,749
探員們  請聽我說
Agents. Listen to me.

1210
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:30,863
- 我的名字是奧布萊恩  - 嘿  誰讓你進來的
- My name is O'Brien. - No. Hell, no!

Hey, I've been working this case for 33 years.

- What do you want, a medal? - Hey!

1213
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:37,590
給我坐下
Sit down!

1214
01:32:38,780 --> 01:32:40,020
<i>嘿  嘿</i>
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

1215
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:41,426
噢  見鬼
Oh, shit.

1216
01:32:42,780 --> 01:32:44,305
他在看你呢
He's looking right at you.

1217
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:46,260
不可能  他怎麼能
That's impossible. He can't see through...

1218
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:49,221
等一下  等等
Wait, wait, wait!

1219
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:07,180
為什麼他們總要殺你
Why are they always trying to kill you?

1220
01:33:07,940 --> 01:33:10,181
我想幫你  真的  我想
I want to help you. I do. I think.

1221
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:12,103
但我  我必須明白
But I gotta understand.

1222
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:15,463
我知道這件事一定是  非常非常複雜
I know what's going on here has to be really, really complicated.

1223
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:17,264
我們要阻止世界滅亡
We're here to stop the end of the world.

1224
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:19,665
那我就明白了
I can work with that.

1225
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:28,982
凱爾  快回來
Kyle! Get back here!

1226
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:30,981
莎拉
Sarah?

1227
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:32,581
去找瑞斯
Get Reese.

1228
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:34,501
我一會兒去找你們
I'm right behind you.

1229
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:44,308
- 快開車離開這裏  - 好的
- Get in your car and go. - Okay.

1230
01:33:47,980 --> 01:33:50,950
凱爾  凱爾
Kyle! Kyle.

1231
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:56,989
凱爾  你可以做到的
Kyle. You can do this.

1232
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:00,145
沿著一條直線
A straight line.

1233
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:04,865
你只要  一直向前  不要回頭
You just go, and you don't look back.

1234
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:08,541
明白嗎
Got it?

1235
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:27,188
找到他  快
Find him. Go!

1236
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:38,028
我看這也是你的吧
That's yours, too, I believe.

1237
01:34:41,580 --> 01:34:43,184
很高興見到你
Nice to see you.

1238
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:46,550
老爹  裝彈
Pops. Load up.

1239
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:55,381
液態磁力霰彈槍子彈
Liquefied magnetic shotgun shells.

1240
01:34:57,100 --> 01:34:59,068
磁性來福槍破門武器
Magnetic Rifle Entry Munition.

1241
01:34:59,420 --> 01:35:01,707
我在槍支彈藥雜誌網站上讀到過
I read about this on gunsandammo.com.

1242
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:04,421
這是最新款的  威力大  無彈片
That's the new breacher. Big blast, no shrapnel.

1243
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:06,708
能放倒一整扇門
Blows a door clean off.

1244
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:10,751
不過你就不需要這種東西了
You know, for people who can't do that themselves.

1245
01:35:10,860 --> 01:35:12,271
拿上  我們走
Take it. Let's go.

1246
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:20,340
你會開飛機  對吧
You can fly, right?

1247
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:21,740
當然
Yeah.

1248
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:23,905
約翰教過我
John taught me.

1249
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:36,907
我會說你們搶了一輛車往南去了
I'll tell them you took a car, headed south.

1250
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:38,061
謝謝
Thank you.

1251
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:42,301
離開這兒
Run away.

1252
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:49,421
抓緊
Hang on!

1253
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:16,788
賽博丁到底在哪邊
Which way is Cyberdyne?

1254
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:19,346
先去海灣大橋  然後往東南
Head to the Bay Bridge, then southeast.

1255
01:36:42,260 --> 01:36:43,546
你們想辦法擺脫他
You got to get him off me!

1256
01:37:20,660 --> 01:37:21,707
是賽博丁
Cyberdyne.

1257
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:23,948
製造中心和研究中心
The manufacturing and research buildings

1258
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:25,545
全都建在地下
are all below ground.

1259
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:28,101
他要追上我們了
He's gaining on us!

1260
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:29,824
莎拉  你先拖住他
All right, Sarah, I need you to back him off,

1261
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:31,351
我飛到他上面去
so I can get above him.

1262
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:34,031
老爹  等我到了他上面  你能解決他嗎
Pops, when I do that, can you take him out?

1263
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:35,666
我可以
I can.

1264
01:37:35,740 --> 01:37:37,026
都抓緊了
Okay, hold on!

1265
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:12,591
你能搞定嗎
You got this?

1266
01:38:14,980 --> 01:38:16,584
- 我會回來的  - 什麼
- I'll be back. - What?

1267
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:49,860
{\an8}創世紀  上線倒計時  13小時45分鐘

1268
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:54,390
打電話  警察  火警都打  快點兒
Call in, call in! Police, fire, everybody. Do it!

1269
01:38:57,460 --> 01:39:00,543
快點兒  快點兒  快點兒接電話呀
Come on, come on. Pick up the phone, damn it.

1270
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:03,547
康納先生
Mr. Connor?

1271
01:39:03,620 --> 01:39:06,351
對不起  夥計  我不能留下任何活口
Sorry, Doug, but I'm afraid I can't have any witnesses.

1272
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:09,784
<i>安保中心  請輸安全代碼和型號</i>
<i>Security Control. State your password and emergency.</i>

1273
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:13,541
安全代碼  祖魯很好  小狐貍  0028
Security code Zulu-Bravo-Foxtrot-0-0-2-8.

1274
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:15,825
警報有誤
False alarm.

1275
01:39:18,380 --> 01:39:19,984
晚上愉快
You have a nice night.

1276
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:34,425
他不會有事
He's okay.

1277
01:39:36,820 --> 01:39:39,061
也許他還在湖底
He may be at the bottom of the lake,

1278
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:41,426
不會有事的
but he's okay.

1279
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:44,351
那約翰呢
What about John?

1280
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:46,024
我想他現在應該很好吧
I think he's doing just fine.

1281
01:39:46,660 --> 01:39:47,741
你看見他了嗎
Do you see him?

1282
01:39:47,820 --> 01:39:48,901
沒有
No.

1283
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:50,750
但他肯定看到我們了
But you can bet he sees us.

1284
01:40:14,780 --> 01:40:16,544
我知道你們是誰
I know who you are.

1285
01:40:17,140 --> 01:40:18,869
約翰告訴我了
John told me.

1286
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:22,548
你們想要消滅我
You want to destroy me.

1287
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:23,941
你是天網
You're Skynet?

1288
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:26,031
我正在成為天網
I'm becoming Skynet.

1289
01:40:26,860 --> 01:40:28,544
你不是個孩子
You're not a child.

1290
01:40:28,700 --> 01:40:31,465
我知道你是什麼  也知道你要幹什麼
I know what you are, and what you're going to do.

1291
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:35,947
你說我要幹什麼  是你們過來要殺我
What I'm going to do? You came here to kill me.

1292
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:39,750
但已經太晚了
But you're too late.

1293
01:40:40,820 --> 01:40:42,060
問他吧
Ask him.

1294
01:40:43,420 --> 01:40:45,821
你們人類就愛幹這種事
That's all you people know how to do.

1295
01:40:46,140 --> 01:40:48,461
殺掉你們不理解的事物
Kill what you don't understand.

1296
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:54,623
就算所有子彈用上也殺不了我
There aren't enough bullets in the world to kill me.

1297
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:05,622
約翰·康納話太多了
John Connor talks too much.

1298
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:10,586
跟我來
Follow me.

1299
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:15,341
那個倒計時  加速了  為什麼
The timer, it sped up. Why?

1300
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:18,304
天網正在進化  我們的時間不多了
Skynet is evolving. We no longer have hours.

1301
01:41:18,460 --> 01:41:20,224
它要提前完成上傳
It will be able to upload much sooner.

1302
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:23,264
它每長大一次  倒計時就加速  這邊走
Each time it ages, the clock speeds up. This way.

1303
01:41:23,380 --> 01:41:24,427
你以前還來過這兒
Wait, you've been here before?

1304
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:27,504
我這身裝備可以讓我打入公司內部
I was able to infiltrate the work crews in this facility.

1305
01:41:27,940 --> 01:41:29,669
你去建築部工作了
You got a job in construction?

1306
01:41:29,740 --> 01:41:31,344
直到我被裁員
Until I was laid off.

1307
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:41,345
這不可能
What the hell?

1308
01:41:42,660 --> 01:41:43,900
約翰還有台時間機器
John has a time machine?

1309
01:41:43,980 --> 01:41:45,186
尚未完成
Not yet.

1310
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:47,991
只有量子場部分完成了建造
Only the magnetic quantum field is complete.

1311
01:42:07,940 --> 01:42:10,591
照這時間變化  我們沒時間跑出去了
At the rate the counter's going, we'll never clear out in time.

1312
01:42:10,740 --> 01:42:12,026
那我們也得炸毀它
Then we blow it anyway.

1313
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:13,340
還有備選方案
There is an alternative.

1314
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:15,667
我已經把你們的聲音和掌紋輸入到
I was able to program your voice and handprint

1315
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:17,868
生物識別安全系統中
into the biometric security system.

1316
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:19,823
在最底層有間安全室
There's a safe room on the lowest level

1317
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:22,028
我們可以使用它躲避爆炸
that we can access to survive the blast.

1318
01:42:25,860 --> 01:42:28,147
那是什麼  危險嗎
What about that? Is it dangerous?

1319
01:42:28,460 --> 01:42:31,543
矩陣多邊液態合金需要編程才有形態
Polyalloy requires programming to take permanent form.

1320
01:42:31,940 --> 01:42:34,546
沒有中央處理器  它們無害
Without the CPU, it is harmless.

1321
01:42:43,980 --> 01:42:45,061
還剩多久
How long?

1322
01:42:45,140 --> 01:42:46,869
天網將在11分後完成上傳
Skynet will upload in 11 minutes.

1323
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:50,585
分頭行動  保持聯繫
We split up. Stay in contact.

1324
01:42:51,540 --> 01:42:52,871
開始吧
Let's move.

1325
01:43:08,580 --> 01:43:11,231
你們人類總把和平掛在嘴邊
Mankind pays lip service to peace.

1326
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:12,906
這是謊言
But it's a lie.

1327
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:14,863
所以你最終選擇把我們都殺死
So your final solution is to kill us all?

1328
01:43:16,540 --> 01:43:17,541
我可不這麼想
I don't think so.

1329
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:19,360
{\an8}創世紀  上線倒計時  8分鐘

1330
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:22,629
<i>倒計時又加速了  我們只有8分鐘了</i>
<i>The countdown jumped again. We're down to eight minutes.</i>

1331
01:43:24,260 --> 01:43:25,500
我不會讓你得逞
I won't allow this.

1332
01:43:25,740 --> 01:43:27,708
你除了動嘴皮子還能幹什麼
And what are you gonna do, talk us to death?

1333
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:28,981
你連實體都沒有
You don't even have a body.

1334
01:43:31,820 --> 01:43:33,663
而你只有一個雷管
And you only have one detonator.

1335
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:38,664
你贏不了
You can't win.

1336
01:43:41,740 --> 01:43:43,026
我不是一個人
I've got company!

1337
01:43:44,900 --> 01:43:46,584
快把雷管給我
Give me the detonator!

1338
01:43:48,660 --> 01:43:50,708
引爆  老爹  快引爆
Do it, Pops! Do it now!

1339
01:44:01,460 --> 01:44:02,746
我做不到
I cannot.

1340
01:44:03,660 --> 01:44:05,788
我不能殺死莎拉·康納
I cannot kill Sarah Connor.

1341
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:06,901
你必須這樣做
You have to!

1342
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:09,102
我命令你
I order you!

1343
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:14,140
他不會的
He can't.

1344
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:16,471
我也不會
Neither can I.

1345
01:44:17,140 --> 01:44:20,110
我要是弄死你  他肯定會按下開關的
Because if you die, he definitely hits that button.

1346
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:22,228
莎拉
Sarah!

1347
01:45:01,980 --> 01:45:03,266
莎拉
Sarah!

1348
01:45:04,140 --> 01:45:05,824
雷管被弄壞了
The detonator's destroyed.

1349
01:45:06,580 --> 01:45:08,628
一定還有其他辦法  快
There's got to be another way. Come on.

1350
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:40,830
不  老爹  別  別  別  老爹
No, Pops! No, no, no!

1351
01:45:41,340 --> 01:45:42,501
不  不
Pops, no!

1352
01:45:44,860 --> 01:45:46,828
我知道如何控制這個地方
I understand how to control this place.

1353
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:48,990
我現在無所不知
I understand a lot of things now.

1354
01:45:49,180 --> 01:45:52,184
你需要認識到  你們失敗了
You need to understand. You've lost.

1355
01:45:52,620 --> 01:45:55,191
還沒有  跟我走
Not yet, we haven't. Come on!

1356
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:08,827
聚能射孔彈
Shaped charge.

1357
01:46:08,980 --> 01:46:11,060
能炸開實驗室  又不會傷到我們
Big enough to get us in, small enough not to kill us.

1358
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:12,505
你有計劃了  對嗎
You have a plan, right?

1359
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:14,666
理論上是
Theoretically.

1360
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:33,800
{\an8}創世紀  上線倒計時  4分鐘

1361
01:46:34,820 --> 01:46:36,265
剛才是誰說
What was it you said?

1362
01:46:38,980 --> 01:46:40,903
我不這麼認為
"I don't think so"?

1363
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:43,901
約翰
John!

1364
01:46:47,580 --> 01:46:48,706
不
No.

1365
01:47:04,100 --> 01:47:06,102
就是它襲擊了約翰
That's the thing that attacked John.

1366
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:09,583
我沒有襲擊約翰  我拯救了他
I didn't attack John. I saved him.

1367
01:47:12,540 --> 01:47:16,590
靈長動物用了幾百萬年才進化  我只需要短短幾秒
Primates evolve over millions of years. I evolve in seconds.

1368
01:47:16,940 --> 01:47:19,591
而現在  我就在這兒
And I am here.

1369
01:47:26,300 --> 01:47:27,950
確切說4分鐘後
In exactly four minutes,

1370
01:47:30,140 --> 01:47:31,983
我將會無處不在
I will be everywhere.

1371
01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:12,311
你只是那條被刪除的時間線上留下的殘留物
You are nothing but a relic from a deleted timeline.

1372
01:48:22,300 --> 01:48:24,860
這麼做毫無意義  我已經成為必然
This is pointless. I am inevitable.

1373
01:48:24,980 --> 01:48:27,187
- 快走  - 我的存在已經不可避免
- Go! - My existence is inevitable.

1374
01:48:27,980 --> 01:48:30,267
你們為什麼就是不接受這一點
Why can't you just accept it?

1375
01:48:30,340 --> 01:48:31,910
因為我們是人類
Because we're human.

1376
01:49:01,900 --> 01:49:04,506
就憑你是永遠不可能打敗我的
You were never strong enough to defeat me.

1377
01:49:07,660 --> 01:49:09,071
不只是我
Not alone.

1378
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:10,581
約翰
John?

1379
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:13,228
住手  住手
Stop. Now.

1380
01:49:15,620 --> 01:49:17,782
你們什麼時候才能明白
When will you ever learn?

1381
01:49:22,020 --> 01:49:23,306
開槍  莎拉
Now, Sarah!

1382
01:49:52,860 --> 01:49:56,262
凱爾·瑞斯  啟動量子場發電機
Kyle Reese! Activate the field generator.

1383
01:49:56,380 --> 01:49:58,621
不  老爹  不行  你不能進去的  你知道後果的
No, Pops, not with you inside. You know what will happen.

1384
01:50:01,020 --> 01:50:03,751
老爹  老爹  求你了  求你了  老爹
Pops... Pops, please! Please, Pops!

1385
01:50:03,900 --> 01:50:06,141
天網馬上就要自由了
Skynet is almost free.

1386
01:50:07,020 --> 01:50:11,309
我沒辦法控制約翰·康納太久
I cannot hold John Connor much longer.

1387
01:50:13,580 --> 01:50:18,302
凱爾·瑞斯  請保護我的莎拉
Kyle Reese, protect my Sarah.

1388
01:50:18,740 --> 01:50:20,504
不  不  不
No! No! No!

1389
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:23,625
老爹  老爹  不  不  不
No. Pops, no! No!

1390
01:50:29,340 --> 01:50:31,308
不要  不
Pops! No!

1391
01:50:38,260 --> 01:50:39,989
- 不要  - 莎拉
- No! - Sarah!

1392
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:42,670
這是唯一的辦法
It's the only way.

1393
01:50:43,700 --> 01:50:44,861
走吧
Come on.

1394
01:51:20,900 --> 01:51:22,948
<i>掃瞄中  請報出您的姓名</i>
<i>Scanning. Identify yourself.</i>

1395
01:51:23,020 --> 01:51:24,181
莎拉·康納
Sarah Connor.

1396
01:52:51,940 --> 01:52:54,511
我們得離開這兒  我們必須找到他
We have to get out of here. We have to find him.

1397
01:52:54,620 --> 01:52:56,065
莎拉  他不在了
Sarah, he's gone.

1398
01:52:58,780 --> 01:53:01,147
- 他已經  - 死了  是的  我知道
- He's... - Dead? Yeah, I know that.

1399
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:04,463
我是說  不能讓別人發現他的遺體  那太危險了
I mean, we leave no part of him behind. It's too dangerous.

1400
01:53:08,900 --> 01:53:10,140
他愛過你
He loved you.

1401
01:53:16,940 --> 01:53:18,510
那些愛我的人
Anyone who loves me,

1402
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:20,500
他們全都
all of them,

1403
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:22,860
死了
they die.

1404
01:53:24,420 --> 01:53:27,867
你錯了  不是所有人
Not all of them. Not this time.

1405
01:53:36,460 --> 01:53:37,507
嘿
Hey.

1406
01:53:41,660 --> 01:53:44,470
你要知道  天網已經不存在了
You need to understand that Skynet's gone.

1407
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:47,220
你自由了
You're free.

1408
01:53:49,140 --> 01:53:53,384
從今以後  你可以選擇自己的人生
For the first time, you can choose the life you want.

1409
01:53:55,140 --> 01:53:56,904
過你想要的生活
Any life you want.

1410
01:54:01,140 --> 01:54:03,063
要是我不知道該怎麼做呢
What if I don't know how?

1411
01:54:08,980 --> 01:54:12,780
這個  既然  我們已經沒剩多少空氣了
Well, since we're about to run out of air,

1412
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:15,790
可是  你不用擔心這件事
I'd say you don't need to worry about it.

1413
01:54:29,180 --> 01:54:30,591
你好  莎拉·康納
Hello, Sarah Connor.

1414
01:54:31,180 --> 01:54:32,420
老爹
Pops!

1415
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:36,865
我以為你死了
I thought you were dead.

1416
01:54:36,940 --> 01:54:39,591
沒有  我只是升級了
No. Just upgraded.

1417
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:41,910
約翰怎麼樣了
What about John?

1418
01:54:43,020 --> 01:54:46,263
他的身體結構沒有辦法在爆炸中存活
His constituent parts could not have survived the blast.

1419
01:54:47,860 --> 01:54:50,261
那就是說只剩一件事要做了
That means there's only one thing left to do.

1420
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:05,144
別叫了  怎麼啦
Easy, boy. What is it?

1421
01:55:12,540 --> 01:55:13,540
嘿  凱爾
Hey, Kyle.

1422
01:55:13,580 --> 01:55:14,581
嘿  嗯
Hey. Um...

1423
01:55:15,540 --> 01:55:16,780
你怎麼過來啦
What are you doing here?

1424
01:55:18,740 --> 01:55:22,142
我朋友很想跟你聊一聊  如果可以的話
A friend of mine really needs to talk to you, if that's okay.

1425
01:55:22,820 --> 01:55:24,151
可以  沒問題
Yeah, I guess so.

1426
01:55:32,220 --> 01:55:33,301
謝謝
Thank you.

1427
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:50,340
我喜歡她
I like her.

1428
01:55:53,740 --> 01:55:55,151
我也喜歡
Yeah, me, too.

1429
01:55:57,100 --> 01:55:59,501
這聽上去可能有點奇怪
Now, this is going to sound kind of strange,

1430
01:56:01,100 --> 01:56:03,307
但我希望你能夠永遠記住
but there's something I need you to remember.

1431
01:56:03,940 --> 01:56:05,385
這條信息
A message.

1432
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:06,871
要我告訴誰
Who do I tell?

1433
01:56:09,420 --> 01:56:10,706
你自己
Yourself.

1434
01:56:11,940 --> 01:56:13,544
一遍又一遍
Over and over.

1435
01:56:14,940 --> 01:56:16,180
準備好了嗎
Are you ready?

1436
01:56:19,460 --> 01:56:20,871
這條信息是
It goes like this.

1437
01:56:22,940 --> 01:56:26,661
記住  創世紀就是天網
Remember Genisys is Skynet.

1438
01:56:33,060 --> 01:56:35,347
凱爾·瑞斯是個好男人
Kyle Reese is a good man.

1439
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:42,906
是的
He is.

1440
01:56:50,140 --> 01:56:51,380
現在去哪兒
So what now?

1441
01:56:53,660 --> 01:56:54,900
你說對了
You were right.

1442
01:56:57,980 --> 01:56:59,584
我可以選擇了
I can choose.

1443
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:22,422
我能說這笑很煩人嗎
You know that's really disturbing, right?

1444
01:57:26,020 --> 01:57:27,590
你早晚會習慣的
You'll get used to it.
