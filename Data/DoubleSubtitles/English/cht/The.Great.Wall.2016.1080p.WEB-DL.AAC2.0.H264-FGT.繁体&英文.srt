00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,050
長城名列人類文明的壯舉之一
<i>THE GREAT WALL HAS STOOD FOR CENTURIES</i>

3
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,260
千年來 屹立不倒
<i>AS ONE OF MANKIND'S MOST ENDURING WONDERS.</i>

4
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,860
它綿延五千五百英里
<i>IT SPANS OVER 5500 MILES</i>

5
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,610
歷經一千七百多年修建完成
<i>AND TOOK MORE THAN 1700 YEARS TO BUILD.</i>

6
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,780
它防御著形形色色的敵人 有真實的故事 也有傳說
<i>IT PROTECTED FROM MANY DANGERS. SOME ARE KNOWN. SOME ARE LEGEND.</i>

7
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,560
這就是其中的一則傳說
<i>THIS IS ONE OF THE LEGENDS.</i>

8
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,530
長   城
<i>THE GREAT WALL</i>

9
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,040
納吉 把馬放開！
Najid, cut the horses loose!

10
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,340
我們得調頭回去
We have to turn back.

11
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,600
都走了六個月了
We have been riding for six months.

12
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,580
- 我們死了20幾個人了 - 還沒死光呢
- And we've lost twenty men. - But we survived.

13
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,680
對 快死光了
Yes. By chance.

14
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,700
下一個死的 就該輪到我們了
Any one of us could have met that same fate.

15
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,220
我們幾個是最棒的 記住我們來的目地
We were the strongest. Remember why you're here.

16
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,420
要照以前 你敢這么說  我早把你給殺死了
In the West, we would be enemies, and I wouldd have to kill you.

17
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,700
好在我們的目標一致
At least here we have a common goal.

18
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,500
對 黑火藥
Oh, yes. This black powder.

19
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,400
它能把空氣變成火焰 一次就能干掉十幾個人…
It turns air into fire. And kills a dozen men at one time.

20
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,260
- 這是我夢寐以求的武器 - 那要只是一個傳說呢？
- It is a weapon of our dreams. - What if it's just a myth?

21
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,780
有人發誓說 千真萬確
Men have sent word that it's real.

22
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,320
那些人 都死了
And those men are dead.

23
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,140
現在該輪到我們了
And we are next.

24
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,900
沒有地圖
We have no maps,

25
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,260
沒有藥品
no medicines,

26
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,400
沒有吃的
and no food.

27
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,380
不行 誰都不能回去
No one is going back.

28
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,940
我們先清點一下剩下的東西
We take inventory of what we have left

29
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,260
干完這一票再說
and finish what we started.

30
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,260
沒什么可用的
There's not much here.

31
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,900
月色很好 等馬吃飽了 我們就走
The moon is strong. When the horse are fresh, we move.

32
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,120
- 去哪里？ - 往北
- To where? - North.

33
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,620
契丹人如果追上來  就在山里干掉他們
If they keep after us, we'll kill them in the mountains.

34
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,080
一塊磁石
The magnet.

35
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,160
太重了
Too heavy.

36
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,400
- 沒什么用 - 留著
- Useless. - I'll have it.

37
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,680
你自己拿著
It's all yours.

38
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,860
伙計 你要背塊石頭過沙漠啊？
Amigo, only you would carry a stupid magnet through the desert.

39
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,500
我能用它做個指南針
I can use it to make a compass.

40
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,160
里澤蒂不行了
Rizzeti won't make it.

41
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,100
他傷得太重
The wound is festering.

42
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,660
- 我們現在等于是拖著一具尸體在走 - 我聽見了！
- We'll be dragging a corpse. - I heard that.

43
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,480
死在那里 是他的選擇
He's earned the right to die where he wants.

44
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,140
我也被人扔下過兩次
I've been left for dead twice.

45
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,260
- 都倒霉了 - 誰倒霉了？
- It was bad luck. - For who?

46
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,680
那些扔下我的人
The people who left me.

47
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,140
他們去哪里了？
Where are they?

48
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,160
是契丹人？
Hill tribes?

49
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,180
不是人類
It's no man.

50
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,940
那是什么？
Then what is it?

51
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,000
不管是什么…
Whatever it is...

52
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,520
牠在捕食
it's hunting.

53
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,740
- 什么東西？ - 不知道
- What was that? - I don't know.

54
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,840
我砍了牠的爪子
I took its hand.

55
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,160
那…那我們現在…
We need to move.

56
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,340
趕快走
Agreed.

57
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,940
得帶著這個
I'll take the hands with us.

58
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,240
帶牠干嘛？
What the hell for?

59
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,860
得弄清楚 牠是什么東西
So someone can tell me what I just killed.

60
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,820
這幫王八蛋  還真是鍥而不舍啊？
Persistent bastards, aren't they?

61
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,880
我們上山去 居高臨下打
We'll take the rise, make a stand there.

62
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,980
人要死了 還得兜個風
What a long shitting way to go to die.

63
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,180
這下完了
Mother of God.

64
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,380
放箭！
Fire!

65
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,420
這樣回去 也是死
I have no need to go down fighting.

66
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,080
沒錯
Agreed.

67
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,260
和前面的紳士們 碰碰運氣吧
I say we take our chanches with the gents in front of us.

68
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,700
我可很久沒有投降過了
I haven't surrendered in a while, eh.

69
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,580
那就再來一次
It'll come back to you.

70
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,060
只要你聽我的 平安無事
Follow my lead. We'll be fine.

71
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,020
當然得聽你的
Of course, my friend.

72
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,660
我們是朋友嘛
Where you go, I follow.

73
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,220
都這樣了 還能平安無事？
You're doing such a great job already.

74
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,580
傳鹿軍 鄭將軍！
All commanders to the great hall!

75
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,580
傳鶴軍 林將軍！
All commanders report to the General!

76
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,660
閃開！
Make way!

77
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,820
閃開！
Make way!

78
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,740
急傳鶴軍 林將軍！
All commanders to the large hall!

79
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,740
閃開！
Make way!

80
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,740
傳鹿軍 鄭將軍！
Commander Lin is needed immediately!

81
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,220
急傳鶴軍 林將軍！
Calling Commander Lin!

82
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,640
紹殿帥 急傳林將軍！
Commander Lin is needed immediately!

83
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,880
他們對那個感興趣
They know what it is.

84
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,940
而且表情十分凝重
And they don't look so happy to see it.

85
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,320
必須得找個機會殺出去
All the more reason to get the hell out of here.

86
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,560
我們的兵器在桌上
Our weapons are on that table.

87
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,600
你確定 你沒瘋？
Have you lost your mind?

88
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,420
我只要拿到弓箭 就能干掉那些士兵
I can take the guards on the perimeter with my bow.

89
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,680
你去干掉那幾個當官的
You cut the legs out from under the officers.

90
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,000
你真具有非凡的想象力
I must confess this is not my favorite plan.

91
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,880
哪里撿的？
Where was this found?

92
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,720
是問我嗎？
You speak English.

93
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,740
審完了就殺
Fantastic.

94
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,540
我問你在哪里撿的？
Where was this found?

95
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,000
不是撿的
It wasn't found.

96
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,000
是我砍的
It was taken.

97
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,740
之前 牠殺了我們三個人
That thing killed three men before we took it down.

98
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,740
在哪里？
Where?

99
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,900
騎馬往北 兩天
Two days ride.

100
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,040
山里
North, in the mountains.

101
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,460
他說在北山 距此兩日行程
He says two days ride north, in the mountains.

102
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,260
- 他自稱 曾斬殺一頭饕餮 - 兩日？
- They claim to have killed it. - Two days?

103
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,220
比我們預計的時間提前了
Earlier than we expected.

104
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,820
王軍師！
Strategist Wang!

105
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,300
殿帥 我在聽
I'm listening, General.

106
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,500
是他們殺的？
The two of them killed it?

107
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,460
- 你們兩個 一起殺的？ - 那個…我們…
- Two of you, you did this? - Well...

108
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,280
- 我殺的 - 你一個人？
- I killed it. - Alone?

109
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,400
- 他說 是他一個人殺的 - 他一個人？
- He claims to have killed it alone. - By himself?

110
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,160
怎么可能？
Impossible.

111
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,320
你是怎么殺的？
Tell me how.

112
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,020
就那么一砍一劈
A swing of the sword.

113
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,900
牠爪子斷了
The hand came away clean.

114
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,140
身體向后一倒 掉進山谷里了
The beast fell back into a chasm.

115
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,660
- 你們來這里干什么？ - 我們是商人
- Why are you here? - We came to trade.

116
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,700
遇上了埋伏
We were ambushed.

117
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,580
來人！
Guards!

118
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,460
你們是軍人
You are soldiers.

119
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,720
林將軍
Commander Lin.

120
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,860
不可
Wait.

121
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,080
殿帥
General.

122
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,980
他們謊稱 是遭遇契丹人伏擊的商人
They claim to be traders who were ambushed.

123
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,120
這蠻夷 真能吹牛
These barbarians are liars.

124
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,720
未必
Perhaps not.

125
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,480
有饕餮斷掌為證
They brought the claw here.

126
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,620
刀劍切口 一目了然
The wound is fresh.

127
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,820
在他們的劍和衣服上 都有綠血
There is green blood on his sword.

128
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,700
完全有那個可能
Those prove his story.

129
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,840
末將以為 無論巧合與否  應立即處死二人
To protect our secret, we must kill them.

130
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,180
- 以防后患 - 林將軍說的是
- Eliminate the possibility of trouble. - I agree.

131
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,840
砍了算了！
We should kill them!

132
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,100
殿帥
General.

133
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,120
他們來歷 尚未查明
Until we find the truth,

134
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,440
- 我看 還是多留幾天吧 - 報！
- I advise we keep them alive. - Alert!

135
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,420
啟稟殿帥大人 烽火臺 狼煙四起！
General, signals from the smoke towers!

136
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,360
有敵來犯！
We are under attack!

137
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,540
先將俘虜 押至北樓
Take them to the stockade.

138
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,200
- 傳令 全體將士 準備迎敵！ - 是！準備迎敵！
- All stations on full alert! - Yes! All stations on full alert!

139
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,600
小娘子 妳真要處決我們嗎？
Are you killing us, Sister?

140
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,820
我們兩只可憐的迷途羔羊？
Two lost travelers?

141
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,620
這到底怎么回事啊？
What's happening here?

142
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,020
你不是保證平安無事的嗎？
Is this bitch going to kill us?

143
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,740
先別這么緊張
I think she'd like that.

144
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,540
真要殺我們啊 親愛的
If it is death, my dear,

145
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,680
你下得了手嗎
we need time to pray.

146
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,900
我得跟她套套交情
I'm trying here.

147
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,560
小娘子 我知道 你們被圍攻了
Sister, I know a siege when I see one.

148
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,300
可是你們城墻這么高 不用耽心的
What comes at you so hard you need a wall like this?

149
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,240
- 我砍的 到底是什么東西？ - 饕餮
- What the hell did we kill out there? - Tao Tei.

150
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,100
你殺了一只饕餮偵查兵
You killed a Tao Tei scout.

151
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,280
就憑你一個人
You killed it alone.

152
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,560
和我們預想的一樣 大戰將至
You are correct. We are under siege.

153
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,180
只是他們的攻擊 提前了九天
But we did not expect the attack for another nine days.

154
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,140
攻擊？
Attack?

155
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,480
- 饕餮？ - 饕餮是什么東西？
- Tao Tei? - What the hell is a Tao Tei?

156
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,340
我還有問題 要問你們
Many things about your story have importance.

157
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,020
所以 讓你們先活著
You are not to die today.

158
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,720
快！
Hurry!

159
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,880
啟稟軍師 鑰匙找不著了
I'm sorry, sir. I can not find the key.

160
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,620
算了！
Forget it!

161
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,500
帶他們上城 交熊軍 臨時看押！
Bring them to the wall. Keep an eye on them!

162
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,900
殿帥
General.

163
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,560
終于來了
It's finally happening.

164
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,440
是啊
Yes.

165
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,660
這一仗 等了六十年
60 years preparing for this moment.

166
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,160
站住！站住！
Stop! Stop!

167
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,820
進去 進去！
Go. Go!

168
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,200
進籠！
Inside!

169
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,400
站住！
Stand still!

170
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,200
坐下！坐下！
Get down! Get down!

171
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,500
黑色的 應該是步兵
The black are the foot soldiers.

172
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,680
- 紅的呢？ - 紅的是弓弩手
- And the red? - Those are the archers.

173
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,420
- 這藍色的是？ - 都是女人
- And the blue? - They're all women.

174
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,230
女人來搞什么？
What the hell do they do?

175
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,760
裝備精良啊
Look at this army.

176
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,220
- 你見過這樣的軍隊嗎？ - 真厲害
- Have you ever seen anything like this? - Incredible.

177
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,120
接槍！
Catch it!

178
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,980
你說城墻這么高
They look nervous.

179
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,860
他們到底緊張什么啊？
It's a big wall to be so nervous.

180
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,800
怎么聽著不對勁啊？
Do you hear it?

181
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,640
- 遠攻！ - 是！戰鼓隊傳令 遠攻！
- Long distance weapons! - Yes! Drums signal long distance weapons!

182
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,860
扶好！
Grab it!

183
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,560
點火！
Light it!

184
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,380
- 對準腋下之目！ - 對準腋下之目！
Aim for the eyes! Aim for the eyes!

185
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,260
飛索攻擊！
Crane Corps attack!

186
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,420
威廉 你看那里
William, over there.

187
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,600
他怎么沒被綁著？
Why isn't he tied up?

188
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,360
我們有機會了
There's our escape.

189
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,380
殿帥 那應該是獸王 牠在指揮
General. There's the queen. She commands them.

190
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,140
攻擊獸王！
Attack the queen!

191
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,160
- 近戰！ - 是！近戰！
- Close combat! - Yes! Close combat!

192
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,960
戰鼓隊傳令 近戰！
Drums signal close combat.

193
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,040
我們得離開！ 要不然 我們就死定了！
We need to move! We need to move or we die!

194
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,360
上 上！
Go, go!

195
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,800
上去打牠！
Go and fight!

196
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,480
快幫我解開！
Cut me loose!

197
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,700
- 打還是逃？ - 往哪里逃啊？
- Fight or run? - Run where?

198
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,600
射牠們的眼睛！
Aim for the eyes!

199
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,140
威廉！
William!

200
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,560
畜生！來啊！
Hey! Bitch!

201
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,140
- 威廉 - 引狼入室
- William. - I need a shot.

202
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,240
什么神 造出了這些怪物？
What god made those things?

203
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,260
反正不是我們的神
None that we know.

204
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,180
- 他們還會處死我們嗎？ - 哪倒省事了
- Think they'll hang us now? - I could use the rest.

205
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,980
- 聽說 今天打得不錯 - 我們殿帥 在夸獎你們
- You fought well today. - You've earned General Shao's praise.

206
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,840
- 牠們會回來嗎？ - 會的
- Will they come back? - Yes.

207
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,540
我們得隨時準備好
All we can do is prepare.

208
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,460
帶他們回營房
Take them to the barracks.

209
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,780
- 給他們準備一個房間 - 是！
- They need rest. - Yes!

210
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,620
感謝救命之恩
Thank you for saving my life.

211
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,940
林將軍
Commander Lin.

212
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,520
你從小 在禁軍中長大
You grew up in the Nameless Order.

213
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,360
我也教會了妳很多東西
I've taught you many things,

214
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,000
妳也在不斷的學習
and you have been learning,

215
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,840
但是牠們也在學習
but they have been learning also.

216
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,300
王軍師說過 牠們在變化
Strategist Wang warned they are evolving.

217
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,120
我們沒有認真聽
No one listened.

218
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,020
我們今天 面對的對手
The enemies we're facing today

219
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,400
已經不是六十年前的敵人了
are more intelligent than 60 years ago.

220
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,060
盯緊那兩個外邦
Watch the foreigners closely.

221
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,760
姑且好生款待
They can never leave.

222
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,600
- 一旦查明實情 立即處死 - 遵命！
- We must protect the secrets of the Wall. - Yes sir!

223
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,660
你是誰啊？
Who are you?

224
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,100
Easy.

225
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,400
等一下

226
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,860
我叫巴拉德
I'm Ballard.

227
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,020
我叫威廉
William.

228
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,500
他是托瓦爾
This is Tovar.

229
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,240
你們來干嘛？
What are you doing here?

230
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,320
- 當然是為了黑火藥了 - 果然不出我所料
- We came looking for black powder. - I bet you did.

231
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,560
25年前 我隨一隊雇傭兵來到這里
I came with merceneries for the same thing,

232
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,600
25 years ago.

233
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,360
也是為了這個？
And did you find it?

234
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,980
- 你找到了嗎？ - 找到了和活著帶出去 可是兩回事
Finding it and leaving with it alive are two different things.

235
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,600
不過 你們參加了戰斗 就等于是先下了步好棋
You saved the west turret. That was extremely diplomatic.

236
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,520
殺死怪獸 不是下棋
We weren't being diplomatic.

237
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,440
是為了保命
We were trying to stay alive.

238
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,040
- 你們身上的味道 像牲口 - 多謝
- You smell like animals. - Thank you.

239
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:22,980
洗干凈 會給你們飯吃
Clean up and they'll feed you.

240
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,080
他知道 黑火藥在哪里
He knows where the powder is.

241
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,940
那他怎么還在這里？
Then why is he still here?

242
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,260
他需要我們當幫手？
He needs help getting out?

243
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,100
可能
Right.

244
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,200
那就將計就計
We play our part,

245
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,900
拿了火藥 就回家
take the powder and go home.

246
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,380
- 你好像漏了一件大事？ - 什么大事？
- I didn't sign up for this. - Which part?

247
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,140
怪獸啊 白天那事 還不夠大啊
Well... All of it. But mostly the monsters.

248
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,080
的確是不小
There's a lot of them.

249
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,860
我們真的很臭
We really do smell.

250
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,420
歡迎貴客光臨
General Shao welcomes you as honored guests

251
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,380
我們邵殿帥
of the Nameless Order,

252
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,600
感謝你們參加戰斗 并贊賞你們勇氣可嘉
and thanks you for your skill and courage.

253
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:42,020
我們榮幸的榮幸
We are honored to be honored.

254
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,320
話都不會說了？
Is that the best you've got?

255
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,740
殿帥
General.

256
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,580
我們見過他的兵器
I couldn't help wondering,

257
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,320
想不通 像他這樣一位神箭手
why would such an accomplished archer

258
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,160
為何 會用這樣一張破弓？
used such a primitive bow.

259
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:06,180
陳將軍認為 你的弓 跟你身手不相配
Commander Chen thinks your bow is not worthy of your skill.

260
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,620
告訴他 這張弓 無與倫比
Tell him there's no better weapon here.

261
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,640
他說 這張弓 全城 獨一無二
He claims his weapon is second to none.

262
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,020
讓他給我們展示一下 讓將士們開開眼！
Let him show us. Give him some space!

263
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,980
- 大家想領教一下 - 在這里？
- They wish to see you shoot. - In here?

264
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:33,920
眾目睽睽 要是為難 就算了
Unless he's afraid. It's a large audience.

265
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,060
- 什么意思？ - 他說 當著這么多人
- What was that? - He thinks you have fear.

266
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,320
你怕出丑
Too many people.

267
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,640
- 你拿一只碗來 - 真練啊？
- Get one of the cups. - Now?

268
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,780
- 去拿一只碗來 - 我都快餓死了
- Get one of the cups. - I want to eat.

269
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,180
照老樣子？上次 你可演砸了
You remember how to do this? Last Time didn't go so good.

270
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,520
- 那是喝醉了 - 多醉？
- We were drunk. - How high?

271
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,720
十碼 向右 六掌
10 yards. Six hands to the right.

272
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,740
- 行不行啊 - 沒事 就這么來
- Turn around. - No. I'll do it this way.

273
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,840
- 聽我口令 - 我說 伙計…
- On my count. - Amigo...

274
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,700
一
One.

275
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,600
二
Two.

276
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,660
三
Three.

277
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,660
扔
Pull.

278
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,020
臭美夠了吧 我可得開始吃了
Good luck with that. I want food.

279
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,880
- 這里還有外國人？ - 你說巴拉德？
- Who taught you English? - Sir Ballard.

280
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,940
他來了很久了
English and Latin.

281
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,180
聽說 都已經25年了
Heard he's been here for twenty five years.

282
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,900
你們一直扣留他
You won't let him leave.

283
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,530
他必須留下
He must stay here.

284
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,420
那我們呢？
What about us?

285
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,480
輕松一點吃 一頓都少不了你的
Pace yourself. The meals are regular here.

286
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,880
我可沒想 像你待那么久
I hope not to stay that long.

287
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,580
這么想就對了
I like your thinking,

288
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,560
我勸你 還是別讓人看出來 你想干嘛
but I suggest you keep your plans private.

289
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,260
你們不是唯一 為了黑火藥而來的西方人
You aren't the first Westerners to come here looking for black powder.

290
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,280
今晚來我的房間 商量一下
We'll discuss it tonight. Bring your partner.

291
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,500
- 你在這里多久了？ - 一直都在
- How long have you been here? - Always.

292
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,520
我不到五歲的時候 就來這里了
I was not five years old when I came here.

293
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,560
我從小 就沒有家
I have no other family.

294
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,960
那我們是同類人
We're the same.

295
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,420
我也是被軍隊收養的 在我記事之前
I was given to an army before I can remember.

296
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,600
- 當了士兵？ - 不是 一名打掃
- As a soldier? - Worse. As a gleaner.

297
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,720
就是一群孩子  在戰斗結束之后 負責打掃戰場
Packs of children, we'd clean the battlefields.

298
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,580
后來成了侍衛
After, when the fighting's over, I became a page.

299
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:59,140
- 一名長茅兵 - 為了你的國家？
- a pikeman's boy. - For Your country?

300
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,120
不 為了填飽肚子
No. I fought for food.

301
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,500
為了生存
You fight to eat.

302
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,620
也是為了錢而戰
You live long enough, you fight for money.

303
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,800
你可以為任何國家賣命？
How many flag do you fight for?

304
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,260
我不確定
I don't know.

305
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,200
我幫哈羅德 打丹麥人
I fought for Harold against the Danes.

306
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,560
救了公爵的命 他死之前 我一直替他打戰
I saved a Duke's life. I fought for him until he died.

307
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,520
我幫西班牙人 打法蘭克人
Fought for Spain against the Franks.

308
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,120
又幫法蘭克人 打布倫人
Fought for Franks against Boulogne.

309
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,680
還為教皇打過仗
I fought for the Pope.

310
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,120
很多國家
Many flags.

311
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,760
我們并不是同類人
We are not the same.

312
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,280
來城墻上找我 讓你見識一下
Meet me on the Wall. I have something to show you.

313
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,880
這個女人 你得防著一點
He should be careful with her.

314
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,520
她可不是省油的燈
She's very powerful here.

315
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,800
正好 我們也不省油
Then it is a fair contest.

316
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,560
上來
Come.

317
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,080
敢不敢試試？
You wish to try?

318
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,420
男人那么重 拉得上來嗎？
Men are too heavy. Do you think we can pull him up?

319
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,130
她說 男人可以做很好的示范
She says men have so much to teach us.

320
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,440
我覺得 她說的 不是這個意思
I don't think that's what she said.

321
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,040
我看出來了？
You know what I think?

322
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,860
你是怕出丑了
I think you're afraid.

323
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,480
射箭前 妳也這么說
You said that this morning.

324
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,500
我這不是…
And yet,

325
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,960
來了嗎？
here I am.

326
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:56,920
好啊
Yes.

327
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,600
那來吧
Here you are.

328
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,160
你是跳？還是不跳？
Will you jump? Or not?

329
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,960
- 他們靠得住嗎？ - 這你不用操心
- These men know what they're doing? - Wrong question.

330
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:32,780
你該操心的是  你身上的繩子 綁好了沒有
Whether or not the cable is attached, that is the question.

331
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,580
- 關鍵是？ - 信任
- And the answer? - Xin ren.

332
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,160
信任？
Xin ren?

333
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,280
信任 彼此之間 相信
Xin ren means trust. To have faith.

334
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:52,720
我們這支軍隊  不為錢和食物而戰
Here, in this army, we fight for more than food or money.

335
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,290
我們的犧牲 更有意義
We give our lives to something more.

336
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:02,260
我們以信任為旗幟 彼此支持 相互信任
Xin ren is our flag. Trust in each other.

337
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,400
不論何時 不論何地
In all ways, at all times.

338
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,200
妳說的有道理 但我還是不跳
Well, that's all well and good, but I'm not jumping.

339
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,090
我能活到今天 就因為 只信自己
I'm alive today because I trust no one.

340
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,640
其實 你信任別人 就是相信自己
A man must learn to trust, before he can be trusted.

341
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,860
妳說的對
Then you were right.

342
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,960
我們不是同類人
We're not the same.

343
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,500
快！下次襲擊 隨時開始！
Stay vigilant! The next attack is coming!

344
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,200
我的天！
My god!

345
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,420
讓你們先開開眼
A taste, a glimpse,

346
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,260
這點黑火藥
a few pilfered grains

347
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,340
還是我從王軍師哪里 偷偷弄來的 很珍貴
from Strategist Wang's supply of black powder.

348
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,720
王軍師這個人 對黑火藥 可是很有研究
He's mastered the transmutation of these elements.

349
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,400
據說有種火藥武器
People speak of a weapon.

350
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,200
這里的武器 五花八門
There are many weapons here.

351
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,580
我怎么沒見到啊？
Why have we not seen them?

352
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,400
你沒見過的東西多著呢
There are many things you have not seen.

353
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,380
你應該禱告
And many things you should pray

354
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,440
打仗的時候 千萬別碰到牠 否則 你就玩完了
will not be needed before the siege is through.

355
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,680
饕餮還會回來的
The Tao Tei will return.

356
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,360
當戰鼓響起的時候
When the drums call to battle,

357
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,840
全體將士 上城墻 各就各位
the guards leave their post and take their positions on the Wall.

358
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,760
那就是我們逃跑的機會
That is our moment.

359
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,600
只要他們一打起來… 我們就開溜
We want to be riding away as the battle rages.

360
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,420
那火藥倉庫的門呢？
And the armory doors?

361
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,000
- 你有鑰匙？ - 黑火藥 我這里還有
- You have keys? - I have black powder,

362
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,300
夠炸開好幾道門的
enough for several doors.

363
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,240
我們互相協作 各取所需 離開這里
He brings us in. We get us out.

364
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,360
王軍師有請諸位
Strategist Wang request your presence.

365
00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:00,020
你搏斗時  這塊石頭 到底在哪里？
As you fought, where was this stone?

366
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,080
在我包里
In my bag.

367
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,520
真是無形的力量
Its unseen force is powerfull.

368
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,620
看來 得好好研究一下這塊石頭
I believe this strange stone could help us.

369
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,840
玄機何在
We try everything.

370
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,460
- 饕餮現在在哪里？ - 鉤吾山 準備攻擊
- Where are the Tao Tei now? - The mountains, regrouping.

371
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,010
牠們從哪里來的？
Where do they come from?

372
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,280
在2000多年前
About 20 centuries ago,

373
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:30,240
有一位皇帝 貪婪無度 令民不聊生
There was an emperor whose greed brought deep suffering to all of China.

374
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,820
激怒上蒼 天降隕石 擊中鉤吾山
The heaven sent a meteor that struck Gouwu Mountain

375
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:36,640
綠光中 釋放出饕餮
turning it green and releasing Tao Tei.

376
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,420
從此 中國北方的土地上  六十年 一個輪回
From that day on, the Tao Tei rise every sixty years,

377
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,700
幾經饕餮的肆虐
to scourge the north of China.

378
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:49,220
以此告誡世人 貪婪的后果
They come to remind us of what happens when greed is unchecked.

379
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,280
饕餮兵獸 見人就吃 無論生死
They eat anything, alive or dead,

380
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:59,160
只是為了去填飽獸王的肚皮
and take food to their queen. She depends on her soldiers to feed her.

381
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:04,100
饕餮獸王不捕食 全靠兵獸喂養牠 獸王吃飽了 就會大量的繁殖
Only with the food they provide is she able to multiply.

382
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,960
離長城八百里以外的汴梁
The capital and its 2 million people,

383
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,100
那里有兩百萬的人口
is only 800 li away.

384
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,460
如果這兩百萬的人口 變成他們充足的食物
If the Tao Tei ever had that much nourisment

385
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,620
那么天下 將永無寧日
no corner of the world would be safe.

386
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,100
- 為什么不去殺了牠們？ - 當然試過 他們去了
- You cann't hunt them? - Men try. They disappear.

387
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:26,140
一個也沒回來
We never find their bones.

388
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:31,720
紹殿帥 緊急巡查西箭樓！
Troops unaccounted for at the West Tower!

389
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,840
牠們為何丟下尸體？
Why did they leave the bodies?

390
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,040
下馬！
Dismount!

391
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,180
建陣！
Formation!

392
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,280
前進！
Advance!

393
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,840
停一下
Stop.

394
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,780
林將軍
Commander Lin.

395
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,460
殿帥…
General...

396
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,220
牠們又進步了
They led us into a trap.

397
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,840
懂得偷襲我們的要害了
We underestimated their intelligence.

398
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,000
禁軍…
The Nameless Order...

399
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,520
- 就交給妳了 - 殿帥…
- is yours to command. - General...

400
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,480
眾將軍 聽令…
Commanders, this is my final order...

401
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,840
從今天起
from this day forward,

402
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:22,240
林將軍 就是你們的殿帥
Commander Lin will lead you.

403
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:28,300
禁軍全體將士 愿接受林將軍的率領
The soldiers of the Nameless Order will stand firm.

404
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,320
保家衛國！誓滅饕餮！
The wall must not fall! We will defeat the Tao Tei!

405
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:37,420
- 請殿帥放心！ - 請殿帥放心！
- Rest in peace. - Rest in peace!

406
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:31,220

樞密院特使 沈大人
This is envoy Shen from the palace.

411
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,920
他特地從汴梁帶來史料 協助我們對付饕餮
He has brought important records to help with the coming battle.

412
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:27,360
- 據九百多年前史料記載 - 九百年前的史料上寫道
- This is a 900 years old batte report. - A 900 years old battle report.

413
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:33,160
當年在寒沙門  有三只饕餮 爬上了城樓
At the Hans Gate, three beasts mounted the wall.

414
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,580
越過城樓 沿途殺了很多人
They killed many men as they went forward.

415
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:41,220
但是 也許是天上神的力量
Then, by the grace of the ancient gods,

416
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,120
饕餮 突然停了下來
the beasts stopped

417
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,910
靜止不動了  士兵上前 將其斬殺
and sat peacefully, as we slaughtered them.

418
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:53,240
當時現場有一塊磁石 跟這一塊一樣
There was a magnet on site just like this one.

419
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,020
當年在寒沙門  也有一塊 像這樣的磁石
At the Hans Gate, was a magnet just like this one.

420
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:02,580
他說 是因為你身上的這塊磁石
I believe that magnet was the reason the two of you Westerners

421
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,940
你才能輕而易舉地 把那只饕餮殺死了
killed the Tao Tei so easily.

422
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:09,600
他覺得是磁石 讓饕餮的耳朵聾了
I believe the magnet makes the Tao Tei deaf.

423
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,060
饕餮聽不到獸王的指令  就靜止了
Without instruction, they fall still.

424
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,540
- 此事如何驗證？ - 確實難以驗證
- How to prove that? - How can we be sure?

425
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,020
試試就行？
Why not try it?

426
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,960
只要抓一只饕餮 測試一下
Capture a Tao Tei. See if it works.

427
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:28,600
- 他說他要嘗試一下 就得抓一只 - 怎么抓？
- He wants to try. He wants to catch one. - How?

428
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,760
根本沒有那么結實的網
No net is strong enough.

429
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:34,860
直接抓 就像捕鯨 你知道我在說什么
Hunt them. Like a whale. You know what that is.

430
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,800
是一種水中的巨獸 可比饕餮大百十倍
A water beast. A hundred times the size of a Tao Tei.

431
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,860
用帶勾的叉 勾住牠 鉤住骨頭
A spear that grabs. Hook the bone.

432
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:44,100
然后 把牠拉上來
Pulled them up.

433
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,960
用有鉤的魚叉  直接就可以把牠抓住
Use a spear, hook them. So we can catch them.

434
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,640
我在西班牙見過
I've seen it done in Spain.

435
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:53,560
他說 他在西班牙見過
He claims to have seen it done in Spain.

436
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,280
你跟著瞎攪合什么啊？
What the hell are you doing?

437
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,500
只要他們一打起來 我們就得逃
We need to be free when the attack comes.

438
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,380
這可是唯一的機會？
How many chances do you think we will get?

439
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,900
裝受傷 玩失蹤 做個膽小鬼 行嗎？
Be injured. Be missing. Be a coward.

440
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,980
別再瞎摻和了
Get out of this.

441
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,840
我們夠意思了
We did enough.

442
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,520
你們要調稠一點 才能麻醉牠
The mixture must be strong to put the creature to sleep.

443
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,300
- 把麻藥涂勻了 - 是！
- Spread it on evenly. - Yes, Commander!

444
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,900
楞什么？
Snap out of it!

445
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:30,300
給我滾到伙房去 不要再上來！
Useless idiot! report to the kitchen where you belong!

446
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,280
- 遵命 - 滾！
- Yes, Commander. - Go!

447
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,380
- 他會來的 - 什么時候？等打完仗？
- He'll be here. - When? When it was over?

448
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:11,180
- 那我們邊干邊等 - 邊干邊等？
- We will start and he will find us. - Start?

449
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,120
開弓沒有回頭箭 我把一切都準備好了
We're jumping off a cliff here. I have everything.

450
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,410
火藥 工具 地圖
Powder, tools, maps.

451
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,260
都藏在逃跑的沿途
It's all hidden and arranged along the route.

452
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,300
一旦動手 根本沒時間等他
Once we start, there's no going back.

453
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,500
- 敢死隊 上！ - 是！敢死隊上！
- Death Squad ready! - Yes! Death Squad go!

454
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,560
大刀準備！
Blades ready!

455
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:27,960
大刀起！
Blades forward!

456
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,360
- 攻擊！ - 上！
- Attack! - Go!

457
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:38,260
- 左！左！ - 右！右！
Left! Right!

458
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,280
- 我去找他 - 甭管他了
- I'll find him. - Forget him.

459
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:12,340
他現在 一心只想著討好那個女殿帥
He'd rather die trying to impress the new general

460
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:16,860
你說 等拿到火藥 有了錢 什么妞不能玩啊？
than grab the key to every counting room and brothel in the world.

461
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:21,340
- 不能再等了 現在就得行動 - 不能扔下他
Good God, man. The time is now. I can't go without him.

462
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:24,640
- 少一個人分錢 不是更好！ - 我們需要他的弓！
- More the spoils for us! - We need his bow!

463
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:29,620
魚叉箭！
Harpoons!

464
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,900
- 魚叉箭 放！ - 是！魚叉箭 放！
- Harpoons, Now! - Yes! Harpoons, fire!

465
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,000
齊放！
Fire!

466
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:19,720
去！
There!

467
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,940
- 讓開！ - 最后一根了！
- Move! - It's the last one!

468
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,480
- 再拉！ - 不 不 不 停！
- Pull! - No, no, no. Stop!

469
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:50,930
停一下！
Hold!

470
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,940
你們拉得太緊！ 鏈子會斷的
There's too much tension! Chain will break.

471
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,700
- 先松一下 先松一下 - 慢點！慢點！
- That way. That way. - Let him run!

472
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:04,820
停！停！我們得等一下 等麻藥起作用了
Stop! Stop! We need longer for the sleeping potion to work.

473
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,180
拉 拉起來
That way. That way.

474
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:15,140
得想辦法 擋開其他饕餮
We need to isolate it. Sparate it from the others.

475
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:18,100
- 火球保護！ - 是！火球保護！
- Ring of Fire! - Yes! Ring of Fire!

476
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:38,380
- 鐵鏈要斷了！ - 不好啦！
- The chain won't hold much longer! - We're losing him!

477
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:49,900
- 威廉 等等 響箭！ - 是！響箭！
- William, wait. Screaming arrows! - Yes! Screaming arrows!

478
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:53,760
中了響箭的饕餮 一跑就會響
These arrows will scream as the Tao Tei run.

479
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,100
瞄準聲音射箭
Aim for the sound.

480
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,900
火球圈內 響箭覆蓋！
Aim inside the circle. Blanket the whole area.

481
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:17,420
放！
Fire!

482
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:59,640
收！
Pull!

483
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:24,780
救你一命 是因為 我想親手宰了你
I'm only saving you so I can kill you myself.

484
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,300
撿把斧頭 盲打
Grab the axe, we're fighting blind.

485
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,700
- 可能現在做不是… - 你少廢話！
- Not yet! - I know what to do!

486
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:13,560
- 火焰擋不住牠們了 - 那就永別吧 兄弟
- The fire is not holding them back here. - Die well, brother.

487
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,140
- 你在干嘛？ - 給她發信號！
- What the hell are you doing? - She's listening.

488
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:29,580
- 火藥箭 霹靂彈準備！ - 是 火藥箭 霹靂彈準備！
- Prepare black powder weapon! - Prepare black powder weapon!

489
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,740
佩戴火繩！
Prepare to light the fuses!

490
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:39,380
是！佩戴火繩！
Yes! Prepare to light the fuses!

491
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,460
- 成功了？ - 是的
- Did it work? - Yes.

492
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,400
抓了只活的
The beast was captured.

493
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:12,900
- 那我朋友呢？ - 放心 他沒事
- My friend... - He was unharmed.

494
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,600
你為什么要跳下去？
Why did you go over the Wall?

495
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:36,000
信任 我說的 對嗎？
Xin ren. Did I say that right?

496
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,160
謝謝你
Thank you.

497
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,260
我們的黑火藥
Black powder.

498
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,960
是一種可怕的武器
It is a terrible weapon.

499
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,980
我真希望你 不曾見過這一切
It would be better if you had never see it.

500
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,420
我對外面的世界 了解的并不是很多
I know very little of the outside world.

501
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:11,280
在我看來  人類與饕餮的貪婪 并無區別
But it seems to me, the greed of men is not that different than the Tao Tei.

502
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,380
我說的 對嗎？
Is that true?

503
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,840
全都是弱肉強食
The strong take what they want.

504
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:30,400
忘掉你所看到的一切
Forget what you have seen.

505
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:23,320
好！即刻押送汴梁
Excellent! Send it to the capital immediately.

506
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:25,880
不可！需就地研究
No! We need to study it here.

507
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:28,880
饕餮若能活捉 皇上必須先睹
If a Tao Tei is captured alive, it must be sent to the emperor.

508
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,440
下官特地為此事而來 這可是皇上的旨意
This is an Imperial Order.

509
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:57,340
你會成為一個勇敢的士兵
You're much braver than they think.

510
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:27,440
沒受傷吧？
You're wounded?

511
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,880
剛才我在找你
I was looking for you.

512
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,700
是想跟你說 謝謝你
To say thank you.

513
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,560
感覺特別好吧？ 想不想唱兩句啊？
You feel good, huh? Maybe you sing a little song, eh?

514
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:47,500
要不 一起唱
I will join you.

515
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:51,280
歌頌一個偉大的英雄 拯救了中國人
We can sing together how you saved the gratefull Chinos.

516
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:53,780
干嘛這么說  一切你都看到了？
You saw what happened out there, and that's what you say?

517
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,140
我看到了黑火藥
I see black powder.

518
01:00:56,540 --> 01:01:00,680
- 也看到 你忘了朋友 - 放心吧 黑火藥又不會跑
- I see a man forget his friends. - The black powder's not going anywhere.

519
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,760
我看 不會跑的是你
What goes nowhere is you.

520
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:08,640
你永遠都得不到你想要的
You'll never get what you want from this.

521
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,300
你以為 他們能把你當大英雄啊？
You think they see you as some kind of hero?

522
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:16,660
想當救世主？你蒙得了他們
A man of virtue? Maybe you can fool them,

523
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,440
但是你蒙不了我
but I know what you are.

524
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:23,200
你心里 應該也很清楚
You know what you are.

525
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:27,400
你就是個賊 是個混混
A thief, a liar,

526
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,220
是個殺手
and a killer.

527
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:36,000
想放下屠刀 立地成佛？
You can never undo things you've done.

528
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:38,720
狗改不了吃屎
and you will never be anything.

529
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,500
這才像是我哥們
Good to see you again, amigo.

530
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:03,220
發現饕餮！發現饕餮！發現饕餮！
Tao Tei movement!

531
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:07,180
全體上城！全體上城！
All troops to the Wall!

532
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,480
- 人呢？ - 不管他了
- Nothing? - No.

533
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:13,620
- 你確定 他不會出賣我們？ - 不會的
- How do you know he won't betray us? - I don't.

534
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,200
他們會殺了他 不管怎么樣都會
They'll kill him. They'll kill him no matter what.

535
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:17,820
他們殺他的時候
The time they spend killing him,

536
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,020
我們已經帶著東西跑遠了
is time they are not chasing us.

537
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:06,160
小心一點 這可有黑火藥
Careful with that. There's powder here.

538
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,460
托瓦爾
Tovar.

539
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,280
殿帥 打通了！ 饕餮已突破長城！
General, it goes all the way through. Tao Tei have breached the wall.

540
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,180
牠們居然如此狡猾
They're smarter than we thought.

541
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,220
- 傳令所有將軍 立即來此！ - 遵命！
- Summon my commanders immediately! - Yes, General!

542
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:22,100
去看看 是不是滅了
Have a look. See if it's gone out.

543
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:25,300
- 安全嗎？ - 安全啊
- Is it safe? - Of course it is.

544
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:56,940
醒醒 開工了
Shake it off, man. To work.

545
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:01,880
安全？差點要了我的命
I thought you said it was safe?

546
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,620
結果 還是不錯的
We're in, didn't we?

547
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:20,520
- 你來了 - 終于醒悟了啊？
- You're here. - We've come to our senses, eh?

548
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:23,600
他的計劃很周密 逃出去 并不難
Ballard has planned well. Getting out is easy.

549
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:28,080
從這里往西 走二十英里后出長城
There's a gate. 20 miles west. We dodge the hill tribes.

550
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:32,800
- 只要我們避開契丹人 - 那就大功告成了
- We can make it. - They need us here.

551
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:34,180
這里需要我們
They need more than us.

552
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:38,100
需要的人多了
- These people are doomed. - Don't be a fool.

553
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:39,520
- 留下來 就是個死 - 別傻了
I've been a fool.

554
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:40,900
我過去才傻 現在不會了
I'm done with it.

555
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,080
哥們 求你了
Brother, please.

556
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,060
過去的戰斗 毫無意義
We've been fighting for nothing.

557
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,480
只是貪婪
For greed.

558
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:54,680
聽我說 哥們  我們歷盡千辛萬苦 百般磨難
Amigo, after all the blood, the cold, and pain,

559
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:58,660
好不容易有了黑火藥  目的達到了
with this black powder in our saddle bags, we win.

560
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:01,260
跟我們一起走吧
You come with me.

561
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:04,980
我不能這么做
I can't do that now.

562
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:09,960
- 留下來 跟我一起戰斗 - 威廉…
- Stay and fight. - William...

563
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,980
- 他死了嗎？ - 沒那么容易死
- Think he's dead? - It'd take a lot more than that.

564
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:26,240
沒想到 牠們前兩次 都是佯攻  我們都上當了
All of the attacks have been a diversion, while they dug this tunnel.

565
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,100
過了長城
They have breached the wall.

566
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,600
汴梁有牠們無窮無盡的食物  后果不堪設想
Once they reach the capital, nothing in the world can stop them.

567
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:37,820
我的騎兵 就算是快馬加鞭  也得兩天 才能到汴梁
At a full gallop, it's two days to the capital.

568
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:42,140
- 牠們肯定比我們快 - 現在風很強
- There's no way we can catch them. - The wind is strong now.

569
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:47,440
明天一整天吹北風 我們必須啟用新發明
It blows from the north all day tomorrow. We have to use the balloons.

570
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:51,660
- 到汴梁要多久？ - 順風約三個時辰
- If it works, how long to Bianliang? - Six hours if the wind hold.

571
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:53,200
如果能活著的話
If we make it alive.

572
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:57,300
殿帥 這些東西 從沒試過
General, none of the tests have worked.

573
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:00,440
準備出發！
Get ready!

574
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,880
走！
Come on!

575
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:27,570
首都  汴梁
THE CAPITAL BIANLIANG

576
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:04,580
- 怎么抓的？ - 啟稟皇上！
- How did you capture it? - Your Excellency!

577
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:09,800
皇上  是那塊磁石 能制住這畜生
Your Excellency, It's the magnet. It keeps the beast under control.

578
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:14,540
自饕餮成禍以來 此發現 最為重大
This is the most important discovery in the history of the Tao Tei.

579
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:18,920
- 樞密院將立即展開研究 - 把他拉下來！
- We will investigate immediately. - Bring him here!

580
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,080
- 我試著… - 你還敢在此狡辯？
- I tried to stop... - You dare to speak to me?

581
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:45,140
- 這事不是我干的 - 是啊 你說 你是個商人
- I didn't do this. - And you came here to trade.

582
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,500
你并不是為了黑火藥而來
And you knew nothing of black powder.

583
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:52,200
你一定覺得 我是個傻子 是吧
What a fool you must think I am.

584
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:56,220
如果我們是一伙的  我還會在這里嗎？我是要阻止他們
If I was with them, why would I be here? I tried to stop them.

585
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,400
騙子！
Liar!

586
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,080
你是個騙子
You lie.

587
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,320
- 你心里知道 不是這樣的 - 如果我不是殿帥
- Some part of you knows that's not true. - If I were not the General,

588
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,740
我會親手殺了你
I would kill you myself.

589
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:11,980
殿帥！
General!

590
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:19,780
- 啟稟殿帥 - 大聲點！
- General. - Speak up.

591
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:26,100
事發時 小人正在翰淵閣 小人親眼看見 他阻攔那兩個人
I was there when it happened. I saw him try to stop them.

592
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,380
你確定嗎？
Are you sure?

593
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,840
你敢說半句假話 我先鍘了你！
If you're lying, I'll have your head!

594
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:45,400
小人以無影禁軍的名譽起誓 所說 絕無半句虛言！
I swear on my vow to the Nameless Order!

595
01:09:59,710 --> 01:10:00,720
嚴加看管
Lock him up.

596
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:03,090
派騎兵隊 把那兩個盜賊抓回來！
Send the cavalry. Go after the two that got away.

597
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:03,900
遵命！
Yes, General.

598
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:29,720
往左 還是往右？
Which way, left or right?

599
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,980
得去高處看一下才知道
Go up and take a look from the high ground.

600
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,280
不！

601
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,440
不！混蛋！
No! Bastard!

602
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,720
- 把牢方向！ - 是 把牢方向！
- Keep it steady! - Yes, General!

603
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:39,200
- 小心火藥！ - 是 小心火藥！
- Watch the powder! - Yes, General!

604
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:14,960
出什么事了？
What happened?

605
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,680
- 怎么了 軍師？ - 我們失敗了
What happened? We have failed.

606
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:23,520
饕餮已經越過長城
The Tao Tei are in the kingdom.

607
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:27,820
你自由了 想要什么 就拿上走吧
You are free to leave. Take what you wish and go.

608
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:31,460
- 這是殿帥最后的命令 - 她在哪里？
- This was the General's final order. - Where is she?

609
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,440
她去干什么？戰斗？
To do what? To fight?

610
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:41,340
- 能打勝嗎？ - 只有一種可能
- Is there a chance? - There's only one.

611
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:46,720
殺死獸王 獸王不死 我們都會死
Kill the Queen. Kill the Queen, or we all die.

612
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:51,300
回家吧 把你所看到的一切
Leave. Tell the world what you have seen,

613
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,940
告訴世人 大難將至
and tell them what is coming.

614
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,360
我的弓在哪里？
I'll need my bow.

615
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:24,420
我要和你們一起 參加戰斗
If I'm to join you, I'll need my bow.

616
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:35,380
啟稟軍師！帶上我
Strategist Wang! Please take me with you.

617
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:38,240
他想和我們一起去
He wishes to join us.

618
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:02,180
距離不同
The distance is the key.

619
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:05,240
這畜生的反應也不同
The magnet is only effective when close to the beast.

620
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:10,260
所以 磁石的遠近
Therefore, the effect weakens as it gets further away.

621
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,260
才是研究的重點
You see I have it under complete control.

622
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,380
記下了 九尺
Write down nine feet.

623
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:10,120
- 往后飛 后殿！ - 是！后殿！
- Steer to the rear of the palace. - Yes! To the rear of the palace!

624
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:11,960
上面！
Above you!

625
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:22,980
- 霹靂彈！ - 是 霹靂彈！
- Light a grenade! - Yes, sir!

626
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:27,380
快接著！
Behind you!

627
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,840
我讓你回家的
I set you free.

628
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:44,140
我還是來了
And here I am.

629
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,100
獸王在那里！
There's the queen!

630
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,300
牠們在進食 不會進攻
They will not attack while the queen is feeding.

631
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:58,120
這是我們的機會！抓住！
We have a chance! Hold on!

632
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:13,320
來者何人？
State your purpose!

633
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,900
無影禁軍 殿帥 林梅 參見皇上！
General Lin Mae from Nameless Order. At your service!

634
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:40,980
你們怎么回事？
What took you so long?

635
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,380
饕餮都沖到朕的門口了！
The Tao Tei overrun the city!

636
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:47,180
朕的幾千御林軍 還有無數的黎民百姓
Thousands of soldiers and innocent are dead.

637
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,200
一眨眼 全都沒了！
You're too late!

638
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:51,420
被捕獲的那個饕餮 現在在哪？
Where is the captured Tao Tei?

639
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,360
- 關地牢了！ - 要利用牠殺死獸王
- In the dungeon! - We need it to kill the queen.

640
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,400
獸王死了 信號就斷了
Once she is dead, The Tao Tei can not function.

641
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:59,320
成千上萬的饕餮 就會僵住無用
Without her signal, their whole army will freeze.

642
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,500
這里有一條地下通道
There is an underground canal here.

643
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:22,820
沒有饕餮嗎？
Has it been breached?

644
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:25,440
現在 應該都在地上
The Tao Tei should all be above ground.

645
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:27,060
這是我們抓的那只？
And the one we captured?

646
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:28,540
帶上牠
We load it up.

647
01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:32,660
喂飽了以后 牠會回去找獸王
We feed him. And it will return to its queen.

648
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:34,120
好主意
Good.

649
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:44,820
你會留下一個傷疤 但是很酷
You'll have one hell of a scar,

650
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:48,020
- but you'll live.
- He says you will live.

651
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:48,020
他說 你會活著

652
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:50,000
回頭再救他
We'll come back for him.

653
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:09,990
牠們攻進來了！
They've broken through!

654
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:35,030
威廉 別放箭
Patience, William.

655
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:54,660
牠吃飽了之后 會去找獸王？
And it will go to the Queen when it's done?

656
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:56,710
應該會
It should.

657
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:00,260
我確定
It will.

658
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:13,620
放牠進去
Let it in.

659
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:38,480
我能從上面 把箭射進去
I can get a shot from above.

660
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:45,770
上去！我擋住牠們
Go! I'll hold them back.

661
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:10,670
快 牠接近獸王了
Wait. Not yet.

662
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:19,700
中
Hit.

663
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:31,510
再上 牠們護不住頭頂
Go higher. I'll get a better shot.

664
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:47,350
殿帥！全靠你們了！
General! It's up to you now!

665
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:43,300
只剩一件火藥武器了 把火藥槍給我
We have one black powder weapon left. Give me the spear.

666
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:47,200
我苦練一生 只為此戰
I've trained for this my whole life.

667
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,030
信任
Trust.

668
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:55,830
我們相互信任
I'll get you the shot.

669
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:42,580
抓緊我！
I've got you.

670
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:02,960
怎么樣 有沒有想我啊？
So, how's life without me?

671
01:28:03,990 --> 01:28:04,980
有一點無聊
A little slow.

672
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:11,830
- 聽說 你是大英雄了 - 那是必須的
- You're a hero after all. - Oh, it looks that way.

673
01:28:12,030 --> 01:28:13,790
瞧你得意的樣子
You seem pleased with yourself..

674
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:16,300
拯救世界的大英雄 有什么獎勵？
And what are they giving you for all your troubles?

675
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:18,600
一袋金子？
A bag of gold?

676
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:21,280
還是在長城上 為你嘉喜慶典？
A victory parade along the top of the Wall?

677
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,150
黑火藥 我隨便拿
All the black powder I can carry.

678
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:26,470
而且派騎兵 保護我回家
And a cavalry escort to get me home safely.

679
01:28:27,910 --> 01:28:29,680
- 那恭喜你了 - 謝謝
- Well, congratulations. - Thank you.

680
01:28:31,230 --> 01:28:32,390
所以 你就？
So what is this?

681
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:35,920
- 跟我這顯擺？ - 那當然啦？
- You're here to rub my nose in it? - Well, would you blame me?

682
01:28:36,350 --> 01:28:38,470
你上次 把我一個人扔下來等死
The last time I saw you, you left me for dead.

683
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:40,360
再上次 我還救你一條命呢
And the time before, I saved your life.

684
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:41,580
倒也是
True.

685
01:28:44,230 --> 01:28:46,350
其實 皇上給我兩個選擇
You know, the Emperor gave me a choice.

686
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:50,470
帶走黑火藥…或著帶走你
I could take the black powder or I could take you.

687
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:55,390
那你可千萬別選我
Please tell me you chose the powder.

688
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:04,350
你讓我很失望啊
I don't even know you anymore.

689
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:10,420
馬已經備好了 日落前 我們就可以出發
The horses are saddled and waiting. Best we ride before nightfall.

690
01:29:16,710 --> 01:29:17,740
我回避
I'll be inside.

691
01:29:18,350 --> 01:29:19,600
走時 可記得叫我啊
Don't leave without me.

692
01:29:30,790 --> 01:29:32,240
我是來道別的
I came to say goodbye.

693
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:37,110
聽說妳 榮升驃騎大將軍了
I understand congratulations are in order.

694
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,950
我真的 很為妳感到高興
General of the northwest territory.

695
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:42,140
應該祝賀妳
Quite an honor.

696
01:29:44,550 --> 01:29:46,280
看來 你已經選擇好了
Seems you've made your choice.

697
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:50,840
他啊？說實話  我真的想用這小子換黑火藥
Oh, him? Believe me, I'm already think about trading him back for the powder.

698
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:52,580
我可聽著呢
I heard that.

699
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:00,780
也許 我們都說得不對
Perhaps we were both wrong.

700
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:04,350
其實 我們就是一類人
We are more similar than I thought.

701
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:11,830
謝謝大將軍
Thank you General.

702
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:42,200
- 你不想留下來陪她？ - 當然想啊
- Are you sure you don't want to go back? - Of course I do.

703
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:45,280
但我怕你一個人 回不了家
I just don't trust you to make it out of here alone.
