傾 城 佳 話

7
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:36,512
從前在紐約  有個警察叫查理
Once upon a time in New York, there was a cop named Charlie.

8
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,517
他是個正派人  他的搭檔鮑也是
He was a very decent guy, as was his partner, Bo.

9
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:45,229
他是個很好的傾訴對像
He was a good listener.

10
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,110
他喜歡小孩
He loved kids.

11
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,708
他有耐心  也明辨事理
He had patience and common sense.

12
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,058
還很聰明
He was resourceful.

13
00:02:27,186 --> 00:02:30,188
來吧  小心看路  來吧來吧  別停下
Come on, let's go. Watch your step. Come on, keep it moving.

14
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:33,650
好了夥計們  大家動起來  來吧  讓我過去
Okay, people, let's go. Let's go. Come on, let me get through.

15
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:36,280
讓我過去  讓一讓  好了  抓緊點走啊
Let me get through now. Make way, come on. Step lively now, come on.

16
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,083
他是個不錯的警察
He was just a good cop.

17
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:56,909
查理在皇后區土生土長  每天都過得很快樂
Charlie lived happily in Queens, where he was born and had lived all of his life.

18
00:02:56,927 --> 00:03:00,137
- 嗨  查理  - 嗨  蘇 你好啊
- Yo, Charlie. - Jesu. How are you?

19
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,557
- 今天幹掉誰了  - 連根毫毛都沒傷害
- Kill anybody today? - Didn't even wound anybody.

20
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,267
最近沒什麼大事
Been really slow.

21
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:09,105
- 不想去看看你老婆嗎  - 她不喜歡在工作的時候被打擾
- You're not gonna see your wife? - No, she doesn't like me to surprise her at work.

22
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:14,151
查理和穆麗兒結了婚  她討厭皇后區
Charlie was married to Muriel. She hated Queens.

23
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,363
我不明白  如果他是探長或是臥底警察
I don't know. If he was a detective or an undercover cop...

24
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,282
起碼能穿得體面些
...at least he'd have decent clothes.

25
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,653
知道嗎  不過就算有了他也不會穿  他就愛穿制服
You know? But that's not for him. He's gotta wear the uniform.

26
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,987
我能理解  親愛的  你也不能對他要求太苛刻
I feel for you, honey. Because you got driving ambition.

27
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,792
我知道  我從來不給他太大壓力
I know. I never pushed him enough.

28
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,796
如果哪天他受賄了  我倒會說  好啊  有進步
If he was on the take, at least I'd say, "Okay. He has initiative."

29
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:37,967
我妹妹嫁給警察十年了  也沒見個好
My sister was married to a cop for 10 years. It's a no-win situation.

30
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:42,138
要麼他是老實的窮光蛋  要麼是徹夜不歸的騙子
Either they're honest and you're broke, or they're crooks and they never come home.

31
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,557
那你妹妹是怎麼想的呢
So your sister, what did she do?

32
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:48,352
她和他離了婚  嫁了一個電氣工程師  這才叫生財有道
She left the cop and married an electrician. That's your real money.

33
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:55,484
我都快沒耐心了  告訴你  我就是那種拜金女
I'm running out of patience. I tell you, I'm a person who needs money.

34
00:03:56,194 --> 00:04:01,490
再來看看這位叫伊芳的女招待  她馬上就要得到壞消息了
And then there was Yvonne, a waitress, who's about to get some terrible news.

35
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:07,663
比亞西小姐  萬事達信用卡的記錄顯示  你已經欠款一萬兩千美元
Miss Biasi, according to your records here, you owe $12,000 on your MasterCard.

36
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,875
法官大人  這些錢都是我前夫花的
Your Honor, those charges were incurred by my ex-husband...

37
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,586
艾迪·比亞西是個演員  那時候我已經趕他走了
...Eddie Biasi, the actor, after I threw him out.

38
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,297
但是銀行並不知道你們離婚
The bank is not aware of your divorce.

39
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:20,509
我們還沒有辦離婚  但我告訴過他  必須把債務還清
Because we're not divorced yet. But I told him, "You have to tear up the credit cards."

40
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,719
他保證過
And he promised--

41
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:26,849
如果你們還沒有離婚  你就有償還債務的連帶義務
If you're not divorced yet, you're still liable for any and all debts your husband has incurred.

42
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:30,686
我已經拿定主意離婚了  您明白我的意思嗎  應該得到認可的
But I am divorced in my heart. You know? I mean, and that's what counts.

43
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,521
這在法律上得不到認可
Legally, that's not what counts.

44
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:39,695
您知道離婚要花多少錢嗎  我是說您離過婚嗎
But do you know how much it costs to get divorced? Have you ever been divorced?

45
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,617
大概沒有  當然沒有  自然不會有的事兒
Probably not. Probably not. Probably you haven't.

46
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,953
好人自然有上帝保佑平安
Probably you've had good luck your entire life.

47
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,956
而這點  我是正好相反
Which is great. Which is the opposite of me.

48
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:56,754
比亞西小姐  如果萬事達信用卡是以你的名義辦的  你就要負責
Miss Biasi, if the MasterCard is in your name, it's still your responsibility.

49
00:04:56,922 --> 00:05:02,885
拜託拜託  我五年前從匹茲堡來紐約  夢想當個演員
Listen, please. I came to New York from Pittsburgh five years ago, to be an actress.

50
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,595
大學裏我演過『我們的小鎮』
I had done "Our Town" in college.

51
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,890
我告訴您  我主演的愛米麗  觀眾都被感動得嚎啕大哭了
Let me tell you something. Played Emily. People were crying buckets.

52
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:12,436
- 我確信他們會這樣  - 還需要別的什麼嗎
- I'm sure they were. - Will there be anything else?

53
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:16,315
因此我來到紐約  後來我遇到了艾迪
So I come to New York, and I meet Eddie.

54
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:22,446
告訴你什麼叫倒霉吧  法官大人  開始的時候  他令我十分感動
Talk about the worst luck of all. Your Honor, he swept me off my feet.

55
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:27,451
他送我鮮花  帶我兜風  請我去高檔餐館吃飯
He bought me flowers, he took me on taxi rides, and real restaurants.

56
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,912
有亞麻桌布  美酒和漂亮的燈飾  您能想像嗎
With linen and wine and good lighting, you know?

57
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,584
一切都很完美  直到他變成一個病態的騙子
Everything was so perfect, except he turned out to be this pathological liar.

58
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,045
我居然相信了他說的每句話
And I believed every word he said...

59
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:42,800
或許就是因為我太輕信別人了  您明白嗎
...because I used to have all this faith in people. You know?

60
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:52,518
所以  所以  怎麼說呢  簡而言之
So.... So, like, in short...

61
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,520
我還能有什麼選擇啊
...what are my options here?

62
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,100
「破產」

63
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,798
查理  穆麗兒  伊芳生活在同一座城市裏
Charlie, Muriel and Yvonne all lived in a city...

64
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:26,677
這裏的人們每天都盼望出現奇跡
...where people prayed for miracles every day.

65
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,972
比方說  買中六千四百萬美元的彩票
Like winning the $64 million lottery.

66
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,974
我是安吉爾
My name is Angel.

67
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:38,188
下面你將要看到的故事  絕大部分是真實的
The story you're about to see, well, it's pretty much all true.

68
00:06:45,998 --> 00:06:47,531
我昨晚做夢了
I had a dream last night.

69
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:52,161
夢見玩老虎機  轉到三個櫻桃  然後  它們又不是櫻桃了
I was playing a slot machine, and I got three cherries, but they wasn't cherries.

70
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:56,665
它們變成了我死去的爸爸的笑臉  這是徵兆
They were my father's face, the face of my dead father. It's a sign.

71
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,001
你不是討厭你老爸麼
But you hated your father.

72
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,338
沒錯  我是討厭他  但徵兆就是徵兆
Makes no difference I hated him. A sign is a sign.

73
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:05,508
我知道你認為我在扯淡  但我告訴你我們會中彩
I know you think I'm nuts, but I tell you, we're gonna win.

74
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,510
我沒說你在扯淡
I didn't say you were nuts.

75
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,888
我只是說中彩的幾率那是相當小
I just said the odds of us winning the lottery are not overwhelming.

76
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,516
你又不是不知道  挺簡單的事
And you know what? It's okay.

77
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,646
在皇后區  單居室的住房可不是我的目標
One bedroom in Queens is not my idea of living.

78
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,689
在皇后區  單居室已經挺好了
One bedroom in Queens is fine.

79
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:25,694
如果我們有孩子  孩子  那就另當別論了
If we had kids.... If we had kids, it would be another story.

80
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:30,533
- 我們沒錢養孩子  - 我們當然有錢養孩子
- We don't have the money to have kids. - Of course we have the money to have kids.

81
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,036
警察能養孩子  消防員也能養孩子
Cops have kids. Firemen have kids.

82
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:37,081
如果只許有錢人養孩子  那還要公立學校幹嘛
If only rich people had kids, there wouldn't be public schools.

83
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,987
查理  你把彩票給我買了就行了  拜託
Charlie, just get the ticket this morning, please.

84
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,128
她還當真了  你應該明確告訴她
She gotta get real. You gotta tell her:

85
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:46,948
作為老公  每天早出晚歸辛苦工作  就為賺錢養家
"I'm the man. I'm out here every day, getting it done...

86
00:07:46,956 --> 00:07:50,678
男人就那麼好當嗎  要讓你老婆懂得這點
...getting paid, bringing it home." You know what I'm saying? She gotta listen to you.

87
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:56,684
- 你開玩笑吧  - 就等我兩分鐘
- You can't be serious. - It takes two minutes.

88
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,396
我都快餓死了  夥計
I'm starving, man.

89
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:03,274
- 哎  各位  警察辦案  大家靠邊站  - 別  別這樣
- Hey, people, this is police business, step aside. - Bo, Bo.

90
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,986
- 只耽誤兩分鐘  - 對不起  對不起
- It'll take two minutes. - Sorry. Sorry.

91
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:11,407
我們得永遠呆在這兒啦  要吃巨無霸漢堡還得走五個街區
This is gonna take forever. Then the Burger King's another five blocks.

92
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:17,955
- 那就去馬路對面那家餐廳  我們沒去過那  - 什麼  那地方  噢  不
- So we'll eat across the street. We never went there. - What, that place? Oh, no.

93
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,257
- 你去什麼鬼地方了  - 昨天告訴你了  薩爾
- Where the hell were you? - I told you yesterday, Sal.

94
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:31,260
說過五次了  個人私事  非去不可  嗨  卡洛爾
Five times. A personal matter, I couldn't help it. Hi, Carol.

95
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,762
你遲到兩小時  得從你工資裏扣
You are two hours late. It comes off your paycheck.

96
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,515
什麼  你知道我還有多少天病假嗎
What? Do you know how many sick days I have coming?

97
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:40,603
如果你想請病假  就生病去  如果沒病  你就得幹活
You want a sick day, get sick. If you're healthy, you work.

98
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,106
給我拿杯咖啡來
Get me some coffee.

99
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:50,696
- 在你頭上  小可愛  - 謝謝
- On your head, sweetie pie. - Thanks.

100
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:57,161
- 那傢伙嘴皮挺會翻的  啊  - 是啊  像個魔鬼教官
- That guy sets a nice tone here, huh? - Yeah, like a drill sergeant.

101
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,040
咖啡來了
Here we go.

102
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,922
- 你們倆要咖啡嗎  - 是的
- You guys want some coffee? - Please.

103
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,423
咖啡
Please.

104
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:15,512
- 你們想要點什麼  - 奶酪漢堡  越橘汁鬆餅
- You guys know what you want? - Cheeseburger deluxe, medium.

105
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,806
這會兒我想來份藍莓鬆餅
And while I'm waiting, a blueberry muffin.

106
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,934
好的
All right.

107
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,438
你呢  警官
And you, officer?

108
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:29,151
你要推薦龍蝦大拼盤嗎
You recommend the lobster thermidor?

109
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,826
這真有趣  我是說  我都快笑死了
That's really funny. I mean, I think I'm just gonna die laughing.

110
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,705
我一整天都沒好事  這是我今天最好的享受了
The kind of day I've had so far. I can't even tell you what a treat this is.

111
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,041
你今天過得很糟糕嗎
You've had a bad day?

112
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,172
- 想好了就叫我  - 一份肉丸三明治
- Call me when you're ready. - A meatball sandwich.

113
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,008
是的  我就來這個
Really. That's what I want.

114
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,720
- 肉丸子  - 肉丸子
- Meatball? - Meatball.

115
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,350
你還真敢吃這個啊  警官
You are very brave, officer.

116
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,023
她喜歡你  真的
She likes you. Yeah, she really likes you.

117
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,776
我只是想讓她高興起來
I was trying to cheer her up.

118
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,480
剛收到報告  有個裸體男人從商店跑到了街上
We got a store alarm on Spring Street and a naked man in traffic on Sullivan.

119
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,115
好吧  我飽了
Well, I'm full.

120
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,867
見鬼  我都快餓死了
Shit, I'm gonna starve to death.

121
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,457
- 這次你付賬  - 行
- Your turn for the check. - Okay.

122
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:33,382
- 小姐  我們得走了  要出去檢查  - 辦完所有事情才能吃飯嗎
- Miss, we gotta run, so we'll just take a check. - After that whole routine?

123
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,721
- 指揮電台不再發佈消息就行  - 哪兒  在哪兒  我放哪兒了
- When those radios go off.... - Where, where? Where did I--?

124
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,058
謝謝
Thank you.

125
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:46,897
好吧  兩杯咖啡加稅  雙人份額
All right, so that's two coffees plus taxes. Two even.

126
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:58,015
噢  天吶  怎麼沒錢了
Oh, jeez. I'm short.

127
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,661
- 算了  警官  不記帳了  - 不行  我有付賬的錢
- Fine, officer. No charge. - No, I have the check.

128
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,455
就是不夠付小費的
I just don't have enough for a tip.

129
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,666
- 我能活下去  - 我可不能不給小費
- I'll live. - I can't not leave a tip.

130
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,294
那就給吧
So leave a tip.

131
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,090
彩票如何
A lottery ticket?

132
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:21,131
就我這運氣  別開玩笑了  趕緊走吧  去把樹上的貓救下來吧  該幹嘛幹嘛去吧
With my luck? Be serious. No. Go, get the cat out of the tree or whatever it is that you do.

133
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,599
不  那是消防員的工作
No, that would be the Fire Department.

134
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,645
- 快點 查理 走啦  - 就一會兒
- Come on, Charlie, let's go. - In a second.

135
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,482
聽著  我有個主意  你叫什麼
Listen, I got an idea. What's your name?

136
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,821
伊芳  伊芳  我是查理·蘭  我們現在是合夥人了
Yvonne? Yvonne, I'm Charlie Lang, and we're partners.

137
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:41,116
如果我中彩了  我就回來分你一半的錢
If this ticket wins, I'll come back tomorrow and split the proceeds.

138
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:45,162
如果沒中彩  我還是會回來補給你小費  你認為如何
If it doesn't, I'll still come back and leave you a tip. What do you think?

139
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,457
- 我想我不會再見到你了  - 你明天會見到我的
- I think I'm never gonna see you again. - You'll see me tomorrow.

140
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,460
- 好啊  我就在這  - 說定了
- Well, I'll be here. - You've got a deal.

141
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,313
好了  再玩五分鐘
All right, five more minutes.

142
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,523
- 查理  - 怎麼啦
- Charlie. - Yeah.

143
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,982
我叫了中餐  上來
I ordered Chinese. Come up.

144
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,860
- 一分鐘  - 你要挨老婆打了嗎
- In a minute. - What, are you whipped?

145
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:21,782
不  才不會  我只是盡盡成年人的責任而已 下一個擊球手
No, I'm not whipped. I've got adult responsibilities. Next batter.

146
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,660
嗨  擊球  擊球  擊球
Hey, batter, batter, batter.

147
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,374
漂亮  我出局了  球在哪兒
That's it. I'm out of here. Where's the ball?

148
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:32,804
蘇
Jesu!

149
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,840
我來了  媽
I'm coming, Mom.

150
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,510
- 你要挨打了嗎  蘇  - 她是我老媽  沒得商量
- Are you whipped, Jesu? - It's my mother, there's no comparison.

151
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,347
- 明天見  小子  - 晚安  查理
- See you tomorrow, kiddo. - Yeah. Night, Charlie.

152
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,725
昨天晚上你去做手術了嗎
Did you, by any chance, have surgery last night?

153
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:54,731
你說這個嗎  不  這只是個隱型胸罩
You mean these? No. No, this is just a prosthetic bra....

154
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,360
查理  求你別在我面前幹這個  噁心死了
Charlie, come on. Don't do that next to me. That's disgusting.

155
00:13:00,371 --> 00:13:03,115
- 我只是泡泡腳  - 不行
- I'm just soaking my feet. - Please.

156
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,200
不敢相信這真是你
I just can't believe it's you.

157
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:08,662
是這樣  不是因為你  而是它的功效
Well, it's not. But it's gonna be.

158
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:13,834
- 什麼時候這也惹著你了  - 從現在開始  行嗎
- Since when did this bother you? - Since now, okay?

159
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,880
噢  上帝  你把水弄得到處都是
Oh, God! Charlie, now you're spilling water all over the place.

160
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:23,343
我想我該叫紅十字會  告訴他們  我們這兒是災區
Maybe I should call the Red Cross. I'll tell them we're a federal disaster area. God!

161
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:28,557
我有一些更大的  下班後我就戴它們
As a matter of fact, I have some a couple of sizes larger that I'll change into after work.

162
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,017
- 查理  - 什麼
- Charlie. - What?

163
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:31,935
你覺得我把胸部弄一下怎麼樣
You think I should get my boobs done?

164
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,189
- 弄什麼  - 沒錯  你懂的  隆胸
- Done? - Yeah, you know, enlarged.

165
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,567
感覺要好些
So I could be like that.

166
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:46,909
什麼  你瘋了  這也太誇張了吧
What, are you nuts? It seems so extreme.

167
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,828
- 就當我沒說  - 我只是不懂你在想什麼
- Forget it. - I just don't think you need it.

168
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,247
行啦
Forget it.

169
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:01,840
瞧  問題是我已經破產
Look, the problem is that I had to declare bankruptcy.

170
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:07,679
我的信用卡被拿走了  什麼時候才能拿回來
My MasterCard got taken away. What I wanna know is when I'm gonna be able to get it back.

171
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,354
我有什麼選擇呢
What are my chances?

172
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:23,779
- 一年一萬五千美元以下  信用卡  - 要我和他們說嗎  好吧
- Under 15,000 a year? MasterCard. - Shall I speak to them? Love to.

173
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,114
嗯  是嗎
Yeah? Well....

174
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,451
等等  喔
Wait. I see.

175
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,167
好  謝謝你  我也這麼認為
Well, thank you. That's what I thought.

176
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:42,464
- 他們怎麼說  - 基本沒可能  我是沒機會了
- What did they say? - Slim to none. Those are my chances.

177
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:46,468
樂透的頭獎已經滾動到了六千四百萬美元
Well, the lotto jackpot has grown to over $64 million.

178
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,804
廣告後我們再公佈中獎號碼
We'll check the winning numbers when we return.

179
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:58,313
- 你選錯號碼了  - 錯了嗎
- You got the numbers wrong. - Wrong?

180
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:05,237
- 我們的結婚紀念日是27號  不是26號 - 那為什麼我們總是在26號慶祝呀
- Our anniversary is on the 27th, not on the 26th. - We always celebrate on the 26th.

181
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:10,993
我們是26號辦的手續  27號辦的喜酒
We got the license on the 26th. We got married on the 27th.

182
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,164
- 那我們為什麼不在26號辦喜酒  - 我不知道  也許因為什麼風俗
- So why do we go out on the 26th? - I don't know, maybe it's custom.

183
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:20,335
你看  事實上  我特別告訴了你準確的週年紀念日
Look, the fact is that I specifically told you our anniversary.

184
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:25,382
任何人都會記得他們結婚的日子
To anybody with any sense in their heads, that means the day they got married.

185
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,969
- 對不起  親愛的  - 26  64  84
- I am sorry, darling. - 26, 64, 84.

186
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,887
他說26了嗎
Did he say 26?

187
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,849
重複一下中獎號碼
Those numbers, again, are...

188
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:39,938
6  12  16  26  64  84
...6, 12, 16, 26, 64, 84.

189
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:44,776
- 什麼  - 我們中了  我們中了頭獎
- What? - We won. We got the jackpot.

190
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:51,783
- 令人難以相信 - 我們有錢了  有錢了  有錢了
- That's unbelievable. - We're rich. We're rich. We're rich.

191
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:57,539
- 頭獎嗎  - 我們有錢了  有錢了  有錢了
- The jackpot? - We're rich, rich, rich.

192
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:02,252
- 我們有了什麼  寶貝兒  - 奇跡隨著烤火雞降臨
- What are we having, honey? - BLT down with turkey bacon.

193
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,255
- 奇跡突然從天而降  - 當然是奇跡突然從天而降
- Any Miracle Whip? - Of course I have Miracle Whip.

194
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:09,217
不論生活怎麼變化  也只是某些事情  某些標準
No matter how broke I am, there's just certain things, certain standards.

195
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:13,680
你生命裏必須擁有一些不變的東西  永遠不變
You have to have things in your life that are stable, that are permanent, eternal.

196
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:17,517
- 夾心餅  脆餅  - 沒錯
- Oreos. Smuckers. - Exactly.

197
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,064
- 謝謝  - 還想要點什麼嗎
- Thank you. - Will there be anything else?

198
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,237
還會有什麼呢
Will there be anything else?

199
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:34,034
不會再有什麼了
There'll never be anything else.

200
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:38,497
天啊  我討厭這樣  我心都涼了
God, I hate this. I feel bankrupt.

201
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,666
什麼
What?

202
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:46,004
噢  上帝  奧爾巴尼保齡球隊是同樣的號碼
Oh, God. A bowling team from Albany had the same numbers.

203
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:50,759
- 他們分走了九百萬  - 為什麼我並不感到驚訝呢
- They get 9 million. - Why am I not surprised?

204
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:56,264
- 這個球隊有多少人啊  - 我不清楚  大概有十二個人吧
- Well, how many are there on the team? - I don't know. Twelve guys is the average league.

205
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:01,019
好  他們是一人一份  還是整個球隊算一份
Okay, well, do each of these guys get a piece, or do you consider them all as one?

206
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:05,941
穆麗兒  穆麗兒  青筋  從你脖子上暴出來了
Muriel, Muriel. The veins, they're bulging out of your neck.

207
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,151
你看起來像是個瘋婆子
You look like a psycho.

208
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,781
什麼  那好  是嗎
What? All right. Yeah.

209
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:19,496
噢  我的上帝  那些球員  謝天謝地  他們只算一份
Oh, my God. Okay, the bowlers, thank God, they only count as one.

210
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:24,793
這還是有十六個人選了同樣的號碼  上帝呀
But that's 16 people that picked these numbers. Oh, God.

211
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,878
我們只有十六分之一
That only leaves us with...

212
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,798
才四百萬
...four million.

213
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:32,884
夠我們生活了  對吧
We could live on that, right?

214
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,470
噢  是啊  是啊
Oh, yeah, yeah.

215
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,974
再少一點也足夠了
We could live on less, even.

216
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:43,937
讓我們祈禱別再有人摻合進來  這樣就沒人分我們的錢了
Let's just pray to God that nobody else calls in, so we don't have to split it with them.

217
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,318
怎麼啦
What?

218
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,321
幹嘛
What?

219
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,284
怎麼啦  你讓我渾身不自在
What, Charlie? You're making me nervous. What?

220
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,708
親愛的
Honey...

221
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,174
我有句話要對你說
...I've got something to tell you.

222
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,390
- 一個完全陌生的人  查理  - 我欠她小費
- A complete stranger? Charlie. - I owed her a tip.

223
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,853
小費  兩百萬美元的小費  得了吧
A tip? Two million dollars? Come on.

224
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:28,356
我從來沒想過我們會中彩  親愛的
I never thought we'd win, darling. I never thought we'd win.

225
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,401
但我們確實中彩了  就像我說的
But we did win, just like I told you we were going to.

226
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:34,196
但按你選的號碼  我們根本就中不了
But if we'd used your numbers, we wouldn't have won.

227
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:38,366
別這樣  別這樣  查理  你我都知道
Don't do that. Don't do that, Charlie. Because you know and I know...

228
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:42,245
我死去的父親托夢給我了  通過老虎機  暗示我我會贏
...that in my dream, my dead father came to me through the slot machine.

229
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:45,749
在他眼裏有美元符號和4
And in his eyes there were dollar signs and a "4" in place of the pupil.

230
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:48,418
好了  查理  你想褻瀆我對父親的懷念嗎
Come on, Charlie. You wanna blemish his sacred memory?

231
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:53,548
太荒唐了  你爸是個怪人  他向雞禱告
That's ridiculous. He was a nut job, your father, he prayed to chickens.

232
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,718
他希望我們能有四百萬
He wants us to have the 4 million.

233
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,596
哎  你想想  如果他認為我們只該拿一半
My God, do you think if he intended us to have half...

234
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:03,517
那應該是2  不會是4
...wouldn't there be a "2" instead of a "4" inside the eyeballs?

235
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,731
那樣做不對
It's not the right thing.

236
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:16,655
不對  查理  你在說什麼鬼話
The right thing? Charlie, what the hell is that?

237
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:20,367
你一直在為別人做正確的事情
You've been doing the right thing your whole entire life for everybody else.

238
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:24,120
只要這一次  也為我們倆做一次正確的事情
Just this once, please, do the right thing for us.

239
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,583
我答應她了
I gave her my word.

240
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,961
查理
Charlie....

241
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:36,091
- 老公  你愛我嗎  - 我當然愛你
- Honey, do you love me? - Of course I love you.

242
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:44,682
回絕她  回絕她  她不會察覺  就當是為我
Then stiff her. Stiff her and smell the flowers. For me.

243
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:51,648
- 如果是你會怎麼做  - 買下尼克斯球隊
- What would you do? - I'd buy the Knicks.

244
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,276
我說的是那個姑娘
I mean, about the girl.

245
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,612
我會帶她去公園  讓她看我打球
I'd take her to the Garden so she could watch me play.

246
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:02,617
我會小心翼翼  然後轉彎抹角給她建議
I'd start myself as a very small, round forward.

247
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:06,621
這麼說你同意穆麗兒的看法  分她一半的錢就是傻子
So you agree with Muriel, right? Giving her half is crazy?

248
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:10,125
要是買不成球隊  我也要買整個賽季的球票
If I can't have the Knicks, I want those season tickets...

249
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:15,832
你就可以欣賞傑克·尼克爾森和斯派克·李  而服務生給你送上零食
...where you sit on the floor with Jack Nicholson and Spike Lee. And the waiters bring you food.

250
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,842
- 說話得算數   - 是啊  弄套音響系統
- A promise is a promise. - And one of those stereo systems...

251
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,303
你在家中房子裏隨便哪個角落都能聽
...that you can hear in every room in your house.

252
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,682
你瞧  這樣你就用不著提著唱片機到處跑了
You see, that way you don't have to be carrying around that boom box with you.

253
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,386
我可以告訴她  我只中了五千塊  我能做到這點
I could tell her I just won 5,000. I could do that.

254
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,061
是啊  是啊  你當然可以啦
Yeah, yeah, you could.

255
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:35,934
這樣如何  賽季套票  音響系統  馬自達GL6
So, what's that? Season tickets, stereo system, Mazda GL6?

256
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:41,823
- 我不能那樣做  不應該說謊  - 遊艇  我從沒上過遊艇
- I couldn't do that. I couldn't just lie like that. - A boat. I've never even been in a boat.

257
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:46,995
- 你在聽嗎  - 我瞭解你  你會做你該做的事情
- Come on, are you listening to me? - I know you, man. You'll do the appropriate thing.

258
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:51,499
- 什麼意思  - 我不知道  這是你的事兒
- Which is? - I don't know. That's your field.

259
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:04,596
來了  一條金槍魚  嫩炒蛋  法式麵包  檸檬茶
Okay. So we have tuna on whole wheat, one scrambled soft, toast crisp, tea with lemon.

260
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,222
- 糖罐在你桌上  - 謝謝
- Sugar's at your table. - Thanks.

261
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,184
- 都還好嗎  - 是啊  謝謝
- Everything okay here? Good, good. - Yeah, thanks.

262
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,355
早上好
Morning.

263
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:17,150
- 你還真來了  - 我說過我會回來
- You're back. - I said I'd be back.

264
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,946
- 咖啡  - 不用  謝謝  其實我來只是想
- Coffee? - No, thanks. Actually, I just wanted to--

265
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,858
我真的想為昨天的事道歉  我太粗魯了
I really wanna apologize for yesterday. I was so rude.

266
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:27,869
但昨天我確實過得很糟糕  從早到晚
It's just that it was pretty much the worst day of my life, from start to finish.

267
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:30,789
- 伊芳  快點  上菜  - 嘮叨個沒完
- Yvonne, let's go, wake up. - Impossible today.

268
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:35,418
- 我嘮叨  伊芳還指望這兒呢  - 別說閒話
- I'm impossible? Yvonne's dreaming here. - Quit the socializing.

269
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,964
別急著走  我得向你道歉
Don't go anywhere, I want to apologize to you in detail.

270
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,175
好了  你的套餐來了  沃爾特
Okay. Western for you, Walter.

271
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:45,971
給你一些像你老媽做的麥片
And for Timothy, some nice oatmeal like Mom used to make.

272
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:51,893
我老媽從來不做麥片  她這輩子都沒做過飯
My mother never made oatmeal in her life. My mother never made food in her life.

273
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:55,230
血色瑪麗雞尾酒她倒是做過  還有白俄羅斯
Bloody Marys, she made. White Russians....

274
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:59,234
- 但她挺有個性的  - 伊梅爾達·馬科斯也一樣
- But she had a great personality. - So did Imelda Marcos.

275
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:05,490
- 嗯  她生了個好兒子  不是嗎  - 你很好  你知道吧
- Well, she produced a nice son, right? - You're okay, you know that?

276
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,409
慢用
Eat.

277
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:16,626
- 他得了艾滋 對嗎  - 是啊  好幾年了  一周來兩次
- He's got it, huh? - Yeah, a couple of years. Come in twice a week.

278
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:22,298
他的情況越來越糟了  你知道嗎  從醫院出來
He's really starting to go downhill, though, you know? In and out of the hospital....

279
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,301
什麼世道啊  真是的
What a world, huh? Really.

280
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:30,098
我們每時每刻都要慶幸自己還活著  而不是抱怨
Makes you wanna appreciate every moment, you know, not be petty or spiteful.

281
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:33,685
- 我能理解你  - 伊芳
- I know just what you mean. - Yvonne.

282
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,647
說到這兒
Speaking of which....

283
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:46,990
我這有張九塊五毛三的賬單  但錢櫃裏卻沒有這九塊五毛三
What I have here is a check for $9.53. What I do not have is the $9.53.

284
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,492
他說他到車裏拿錢包去了
He went to get his wallet out of the car. He said--

285
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,828
絕不能讓他們出門
Never let them out the door.

286
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:55,790
- 你以為我是搞慈善的嗎  - 對不起  我錯了
- What am I running here, a soup kitchen? - I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

287
00:22:55,958 --> 00:23:02,464
當然是你的錯  這九塊五毛三從你工資裏扣  給我拿杯咖啡來
You sure did, gorgeous. And the $9.53, it gets deducted from your check. Bring me some coffee.

288
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,441
讓我來
Let me.

289
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,533
慢用
Enjoy.

290
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,626
這才叫咖啡呢
Now, that's coffee.

291
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:40,666
嗯  我們剛才說到哪兒了
So, what'll it be?

292
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:44,839
- 他們確實  他們真的  - 真的很難得
- They're actually.... They're right.... - Amazing, but true.

293
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:48,343
我們現在有哈密瓜  還有柚子  那麼
We are all out of cantaloupe, and the grapefruit's all dried out, so....

294
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:50,678
不  我不餓
No, I'm not hungry.

295
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:54,015
我想說的是  想給你一樣東西
The thing is, I got something for you.

296
00:23:56,685 --> 00:24:01,022
- 給我的  - 這只是個小東西
- For me? - It's just, you know, a trifle.

297
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,362
可以嗎
May I?

298
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:12,117
把這個小鏈子繫在你的眼鏡腿上
It's one of those little strings that you connect to your glasses...

299
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,537
然後把眼鏡掛在脖子上
...so that they hang around your neck.

300
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:20,959
這樣你隨時就會知道它們在哪兒了
And that way you'll know where they are. At all times.

301
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:32,887
這簡直是我收到的最好的禮物
This is the nicest thing anyone's ever gotten me.

302
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:38,810
- 我都希望不是  - 差不多是
- I certainly hope not. - It's close.

303
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:43,164
你確定不吃點什麼嗎  咖啡要麼
You sure that I can't get you anything? Like a coffee or tea?

304
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:47,710
來杯不含咖啡因的吧  其實今天我心跳得太快了
Decaf, please. I've reached my target heart rate for the day.

305
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:48,945
不含咖啡因的
Decaf it is.

306
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:57,912
- 呃  你運氣不好嗎  - 說出來你都不信
- So, you've had bad luck? - Unbelievable.

307
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,542
十一歲的時候  我養的小狗死於毒癥
When I was 11, my dog died of parvo.

308
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:06,838
至今我仍然不知道那到底是什麼毒癥
I still don't even know, to this day, what parvo is.

309
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:11,209
我嫁錯了人  我的意思是這個人毛病真多 我運氣真不好
I married the wrong man. I mean the wrong, by a lot, man.

310
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:13,428
你能想像嗎
You know?

311
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:17,682
現在  我負擔不起離婚的費用  直到昨天
Now I can't afford to get divorced. I mean, except for yesterday....

312
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,136
知道嗎  我已經習慣走霉運了
You know, I'm used to my luck.

313
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:26,733
但昨天  我來上班前  剛被法院宣佈破產
But yesterday, I actually went bankrupt before I came into work, which was....

314
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,527
這就是為什麼我對你態度不好
That's why I was so rude to you.

315
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,776
- 你破產了  - 是啊
- You went bankrupt? - Yep.

316
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,820
- 看  警官送的  - 真體貼  親愛的
- Look. From the officer. - That's sweet, honey.

317
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:40,288
- 等等  - 什麼
- Wait. - What?

318
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:41,831
說一下我們的協議吧
About our little agreement.

319
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,338
雙倍小費  或是彩票獎金的一半
Double the tip, or half of what I won in the lottery.

320
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:56,621
- 那個協議  - 由你任選一項
- That agreement. - How about we make it your choice.

321
00:25:56,639 --> 00:26:01,576
選項一  雙倍小費  選項二  彩票獎金的一半
Door one, double the tip. Door two, half of what I won in the lottery.

322
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:04,771
讓我選  好吧
My choice? Okay.

323
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:11,986
管它了  我選二  我要一半獎金  要現錢
Whatever. I'll take door number two. I'll take half of the lottery. Pay up.

324
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:16,857
- 你確定  - 那當然
- You're sure? - Positive.

325
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:29,654
- 我也希望你選這個  - 我想也是  下次好運  彩票沒中  對吧
- I was hoping you'd say that. - I'll bet you were. Better luck next time, right?

326
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:33,588
其實  我們  我們這次運氣就很好
Actually, we were.... We were pretty lucky.

327
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:37,011
- 真的嗎  你中了多少錢  - 我們中了多少錢
- Really? Did you win something? - We won something.

328
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:41,975
好吧  我們中了多少錢
All right. We won something? What did we win?

329
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,185
四百萬美元
Four million dollars.

330
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,027
- 你幹嘛這樣  - 怎麼了
- Why are you doing this? - What?

331
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,856
開這種可惡的玩笑
This sick joke.

332
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,525
- 不 這不是玩笑  - 這不是開玩笑嗎
- No, it's not a joke. - This is not a joke?

333
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:00,528
- 不是  - 不是嗎  你剛才說什麼來著
- No. - No? What you're telling me....

334
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,738
你對我說什麼  你真的
What you're saying to me.... You really....

335
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,241
- 怎麼  你以為我想拿你尋開心嗎  - 是的  我是那麼想的
- What, you think I'd make this up? - Yes, yes, I do.

336
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,749
我沒有  我們中獎了
I'm not. We won.

337
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,580
彩票  紐約州的  樂透彩票
The lottery? The New York State--? The "lottery" lottery?

338
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,322
真的是紐約樂透彩票  四百萬美元
The actual New York State lottery? Four million dollars?

339
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:17,048
是的  分到四百萬  昨天晚上開的獎  原本可能更多
Yes, 4 million is our share. It happened last night. It would've been more...

340
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,589
但奧爾巴尼保齡球隊也中彩了
...except a bowling team from Albany called in...

341
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,383
他們從獎池裏分了九百萬獎金  不管怎麼說  我們還是中彩了
...they took about 9 million out of the pot, but we won.

342
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:27,228
你是說  你真要和我平分獎金
And you're telling me that you're actually going to split it with me?

343
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,899
說話得算數
A promise is a promise.

344
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,989
噢  我的上帝呀
Oh, my God.

345
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:45,246
- 你沒事吧  - 噢  我的上帝呀
- You all right? - Oh, my God.

346
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:50,126
噢  我的上帝  噢  我的上帝  噢  我的上帝呀
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

347
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:58,134
我簡直不敢相信
I can't believe it.

348
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:02,156
現在我知道為什麼我要經歷那麼多糟糕的事情了  現在我知道為什麼了
Now I know why all these bad things happened. I know why now.

349
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:07,140
這真是太不可思議了  令人難以置信的事情怎麼可能發生在我身上
It's so this stupendous, phenomenal, unbelievably great thing could happen to me.

350
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:11,015
因為我承受過如此多的晦氣  太可怕了  這又算得了什麼呢
Because I had such bad, horrible, horrible luck before, no one would even mind.

351
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,104
誰要奶油冰淇淋
Who wants ice cream on their pie?

352
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,860
- 我要  - 誰要餡餅
- I do! - Who wants pie?

353
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,321
謝謝你
Thank you.

354
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:39,675
等一等  我不能接受這個  我不能
Wait a minute. I can't accept this, can I? I mean....

355
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:46,307
我不能接受這個  我是說  我想  我非常期待  但是
I can't accept this. I mean, I want to, so desperately I want to, but....

356
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:49,644
但是在我看來  在我看來
But there's this part of me, this neurotic part of me--

357
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:51,020
接受吧

你應該被送到精神病院關上一輩子  再也不讓出來
You should be committed to an insane asylum for the rest of your natural life.

362
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:20,091
他們應該給你穿上拘束病服
They should put you in a straitjacket and take you to the loony bin...

363
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:24,345
然後把你送到被曝光的斯塔登島瘋人院去
...on Staten Island that Geraldo Rivera is always exposing.

364
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:28,850

Now, look, sweetheart, you weren't there. Okay?

- She's got a boss from hell. - Why did you stop at half?

367
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,985
你為什麼不全都給她
Why didn't you just give her all the money?

368
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,697
- 你別踩我的腳  - 你瞧  我們做的是正確的事情
- Would you get off my foot? - Look, we're doing the right thing.

369

你知道嗎  整個城市都會欽佩你  大家都會認識你  你就成名人啦
You know what? The whole city will admire you. Everybody will know you. You'll be a celebrity.

370
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:53,284
好吧  也許我能因此成為某些商品的代言人
Well, maybe I could get some commercial endorsements out of this.

So you promised Miss Biasi if your ticket came in, you'd split it?

對  就當是小費
That's right. As a tip.

作為小費  我們採訪到一位警察給了女招待兩百萬美元的小費
As a tip? Hey. We got a cop that gave a waitress a $2 million tip.

...Muriel Lang, the woman with the heart of gold.

394
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,808

我覺得她看上去挺樸素的
I thought she looked just fine.

說他拿槍頂著腦袋
...says he's holding a Luger to his head...

452
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:40,341

...unless you give him $1,000 he's pulling the trigger.

- It's just weird. - I feel bad for you, baby.

457
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,400
我沒說中獎不好  我只是說有點煩  暫時不適應
I'm not badmouthing it, all right? I'm just saying, it's an adjustment.

Oh, man, that bitch would work if she was dead.

471
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:12,850
- 然後  他給了我咖啡卻沒有收錢  - 見鬼  他被打劫了  我們怎麼辦
- Then he gives me coffee for free. - Shit. He is getting robbed. How do we play it?

472
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:16,120
站得遠點  讓他們可以看到你  我從地下室進去
Stay out front so they can see you. I'll go through the basement.

473
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:19,355
- 別逞能  - 放心  請求增援
- Don't be a hero. - Don't worry. Call for some back-up.

474
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:21,692
快點
Faster.

475
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,111
快點
Faster!

476
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,030
- 都站著別動  - 快拿過來
- Nobody moves. - Come on!

477
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:29,466
拿盒維吉尼亞香煙來
A carton of Virginia Slims.

478
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,806
那個警察就在外面
That cop's just sitting out there.

479
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:55,309
別管那警察
Don't worry about the cop.

480
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,563
什麼聲音
What was that?

481
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:03,152
到這兒來  注意警察
Come here. Watch him.

482
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:11,241
走吧  該走了  快點  夥計  走啊
Come on, let's go. Come on, pal. Move.

483
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,917
- 後面是什麼聲音  - 沒什麼  沒入口
- What's back through there? - Nothing. No entrance.

484
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:24,505
- 那門怎麼回事兒  - 是空的  是地下室  只有老鼠
- What about that door? - Empty. Basement. Just rats.

485
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,007
- 老鼠  - 大老鼠
- Rats? -Big ones.

486
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:32,512
我最討厭老鼠   為什麼不清理乾淨
I hate rats. Don't you keep this place clean?

487
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:40,354
誰都別動  不許動
Nobody move. Nobody!

488
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:45,025
那警察在幹嘛
What's with this cop?

489
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:49,071
他什麼都不會  只會開罰單
He's got nothing better to do than write tickets?

490
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,532
哪管得了紐約這麼多犯罪
With all the crime in this city?

491
00:40:53,368 --> 00:41:00,290
- 我們怎麼辦  - 等到他離開
- What do we do? - Wait till he leaves.

492
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:06,547
- 如果他不走的話  又怎麼辦  - 他會走的  閉嘴
- What if he doesn't leave, then what? - He'll leave. Just shut up.

493
00:41:14,107 --> 00:41:16,900
老婆  老婆  你怎麼啦
Honey, you all right?

494
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:21,644
- 她怎麼回事  - 她大概是犯心臟病了
- What's the matter with her? - I think she's having a heart attack.

495
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,901
- 閉嘴  - 快叫醫生
- Shut up. - Call a doctor.

496
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,487
在這兒我就是醫生
I'm the doctor here, honey.

497
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,498
見鬼
Shit.

498
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:52,801
起來  起來  查理  起來  老兄你沒事吧
Come on. Get up, Charlie. Get up, man. You all right?

499
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:55,429
進去  裏面  還有個傢伙在裏面
Get inside, inside, there's another one inside.

500
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:57,931
進去  還有個傢伙在裏面
Get in. There's another one inside.

501
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,934
起來  查理  起來  老兄  你還行嗎  老兄
Come on, Charlie, get up, man. You all right, man?

502
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:07,274
- 你幹嘛不對這個混蛋開槍啊  - 店裏面人太多了
- Why didn't you just shoot this asshole? - Too many customers.

503
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:11,445
- 你還好嗎  老兄  - 我還好
- You all right, man? - Yeah, I'm great.

504
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:21,455
噢  老兄  你中槍了
Oh, man, you got shot.

505
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,050
「彩票警察勇鬥劫犯」

506
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:29,421
他英勇地行為挽救了生命  並且防止更多無辜人員受傷  除了他自己
His heroism saved lives and prevented injuries, though not to himself.

507
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:32,841
他堅決的制止了犯罪份子
And certainly not to the criminals he stopped.

508
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:38,555
所以  我現在授予查理·蘭警官英勇獎章
So I give to Officer Charles Lang this citation for bravery...

509
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:41,975
並且祝他盡快康復  警官
...and wish him a quick recovery. Officer.

510
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,646
非常感謝
Thank you very much.

511
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:52,653
我想這顆子彈告訴我  可以放鬆一段時間了  這是命運
I guess this bullet was fate telling me to take it easy for a while.

512
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,529
這是我太太說的
At least, that's what my wife says.

513
00:42:56,658 --> 00:43:00,661
我喜歡做警察  不論怎樣
I love being a cop, lottery or no lottery.

514
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:03,997
我認為這是世上最重要的工作
I think it's the most important job in the world.

515
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:07,869
所以我決定給警察遺屬撫恤基金會
So I'd like to announce that I'll be donating $10,000...

516
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:10,996
捐贈一萬美元
...to the Policemen's Widows' Fund.

517
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,007
非常感謝
Thanks a lot.

518
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:22,199
查理  你很年輕  可不能像老頭兒一樣  賴在這兒閒逛
Charlie, you're too young to be hanging around here like an old man.

519
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:25,867
喂  我受傷了  你沒看報紙嗎  關於英雄警察的
Hey, I'm injured. Don't you read the papers? Hero cop?

520
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:30,482
- 像你這樣的英雄  一隻手也能玩球  - 如果可以的話  我也想試試
- If you're such a hero, play ball with one hand. - If I could, I would.

521
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:34,511
- 再見  - 嗯  一會兒見
- See you. - Yeah, see you later.

522
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:57,259
- 下午好  先生  - 下午好
- Good afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon.

523
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,641
- 這兒看起來像貝魯特似的  - 不錯吧
- This looks like Beirut. - Isn't it great?

524
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:06,393
噢  老公
Oh, honey.

525
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:11,230
這裏明年就要開發了  到時候我們將有六個房間的公寓賣出去
The building's going co-op next year, then we'll have a six-room apartment to sell.

526
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:13,226
- 帕特爾先生告訴我的  - 誰
- Mr. Patel told me. - Who?

527
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:16,396
帕特爾先生  我是你的會計師  你好  很高興見到你
Mr. Patel. Hi, I'm your accountant. Hello, pleased to meet you.

528
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,900
順便說說  正常情況下你們的未來前景非常好
By the way, all the very best on your new fortune.

529
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,741
謝謝
Thank you.

530
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:25,238
他說  這套公寓我們可能淨賺十萬美元
He says that we can make $100,000, pure profit, on this apartment.

531
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:26,413
保守估計
Minimum.

532
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:30,577
如果我們一年內搬到新澤西  那就連稅務都免了
And then we'll beat the state and city taxes if we move to Jersey within the year.

533
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:37,299
- 等等  我不想去新澤西  我想待在這裏  - 留下來幹嘛  打棒球啊
- But I don't wanna live in Jersey. I wanna stay here. - And do what? Play stickball?

534
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:42,429
建築師打來的  抱歉
It's the architect. Excuse me.

535
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:45,807
- 我的椅子在哪兒  - 我把它捐了
- Where's my chair? - I gave it to Goodwill.

536
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:50,437
你知道我很喜歡它  連問都不問我
But you know I love that chair. You could have asked me.

537
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:57,610
為什麼要問  反正你喜歡到處施捨
Why should I? You're the one that loves to give everything away.

538
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:03,985
女人  誰能和她們一起生活  誰又能沒有她們
Women. Who can live with them? And without them?

539
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,860
什麼
What?

540
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:17,005
- 格雷的古董店又被盜了 - 又被盜了嗎
- Gray's Antiques had another break-in. - Again?

541
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:22,135
是啊  倆兄弟溜進去偷了一件比德邁盔甲
Yeah. Two brothers walked off with a Biedermeier chest.

542
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:26,014
格雷說  黑人怎麼可能瞭解它的價值呢
Then Gray says to me, "How could some black guys know how much this is worth?"

543
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:29,344
- 不會吧  他這樣說的嗎  - 是啊  當著我的面說的
- Oh, come on. He said that? - Yeah. To me.

544
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:30,394
那你怎麼說的
What did you say?

545
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:36,149
我說  我想他們大概會向美國非洲古董協會咨詢
I said, "I guess they subscribe to the African-American Antiques Newsletter."

546
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:39,143
他很生我的氣
He pissed me off.

547
00:45:41,823 --> 00:45:45,659
- 我挺想你的  夥計  - 我現在腦子一片空白
- I miss you, man. - I'm going out of my mind.

548
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:47,988
這生活就像地獄似的
This is like hell.

549
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,740
我的房子在裝修  沒我什麼事
My house is a wreck, and I got nothing to do....

550
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,983
其實  這就是退休生活
Well, that's retirement.

551
00:45:55,503 --> 00:46:00,424
- 噢  伊芳餐館  - 她幾個星期前買下的
- Well. "Yvonne's." - She bought it a couple of weeks ago.

552
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,377
對她來說不錯
Good for her.

553
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:05,130
- 還需要些什麼  - 茶  謝謝

- How's the soup? - Not enough basil.

557
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:22,195
你開玩笑吧  我看看能做些什麼
You're kidding me. I'll see what I can do.

558
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:27,988
- 進去吧  打個招呼  - 算了  她挺忙的
- Go in. Say hello. - Forget it, she's busy.

559
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:32,897
得了  夥計  我知道你想進去
Come on, man. I know you're dying to go in there.

560
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:37,989
不  我得回家  對了  我給你帶了樣東西
No, I've got to get home. By the way, I got you something.

561
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:41,289
- 紐約尼克斯隊的賽季套票  - 噢  天吶
- Season tickets to the Knicks. - Oh, shit!

562
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:45,510
- 不是最前排的  - 尼克斯隊的  老兄  給我的嗎
- They're not on the floor-- - Knicks tickets, man? For me?

563
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:48,381
你得是大人物才能坐在前排
You gotta be really somebody to get them on the floor.

564
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:51,259
沒關係  擁抱一下
Don't worry about that, give me some.

565
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:52,969
- 我該回家了  - 尼克斯隊的票

- Man, oh, man. Seat 7. - I'm glad she's doing well.

567
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:10,654
我不懂你為什麼要帶大衣來  晚上挺暖和的
I don't know why you had to bring this coat. It's a warm night.

568
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,830
也許過一會兒我會冷  拿好吧
Maybe I'll get a chill later. Just hold it.

569
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:28,512
- 這裏人真多啊  - 不錯吧
- There certainly are a lot of people here. - Isn't it great?

570
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:32,092
感覺就像參加奧斯卡頒獎典禮
I feel like we're at the Academy Awards.

571
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,184
- 謝謝  - 我去轉一轉
- Thank you. - I'm going to go circulate.

572

- 這是你的唇膏  - 噢  謝謝
- Here's your lipstick. - Oh, thanks.

574
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:57,891
我賺了五千五百萬美元  並且讓我的淨資產增加了百分之四十
I won $55 million, and increased my net worth by 40 percent...

575
00:47:57,959 --> 00:48:00,987
因為我選對了共有基金
...through a variety of well-chosen mutual funds.

576
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:05,590
- 百分之四十  - 幾乎沒有風險
- Forty percent? - At virtually no risk.

577
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:11,304
S & L基金  生物工程基金  黃金基金  它們都是垃圾
S & L funds, Biotech funds. Gold funds, they were a disaster.

578
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:12,966
離這些遠一點
Stay away from those.

579
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:16,568
噢  我會的  你認為國庫券怎麼樣
Oh, I will. What do you think about Treasury Bills?

580
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:22,148
呃  它們是給小老太太玩的  你顯然不是
Well, they're for little old ladies. Which you certainly are not.

581
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,974
你可真是頭猛獸
Aren't you a tiger.

582
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,895
為什麼你不能找開二十美元
How can you not have change for 20 dollars?

583
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:54,215
不可能啊  你整天都在開車
It's just not possible. You drive all day.

584
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:57,642
- 我們去找人換零錢  - 不  我們不能去找人換零錢
- We go get change. - No, we cannot go get change.

585
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,227
那你得換開
You have to break this.

586
00:48:59,395 --> 00:49:01,021
嗨
Hi.

587
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:07,027
噢  你好  你好  你能找開二十塊零錢嗎
Well, hi. Hi. Can you break a 20?

588
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:16,202
你應該說  零錢不用找了
Repeat after me: "Keep the change."

589
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:20,206
- 零錢不用找了  - 謝謝
- "Keep the change." - Thank you.

590
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:23,043
謝謝
Thank you.

591
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:30,050
- 噢  我的上帝  船開了 - 噢  不  等等
- Oh my God, the boat. - Oh, no. Wait.

592
00:49:31,052 --> 00:49:33,136
等等
Wait!

593
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:47,232
我想你太太是在
I suppose your wife is....

594
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:52,906
她跟她那一夥人在一起  股票經紀人  會計師  她喜歡和這些人在一起
She's in her element. Stockbrokers, CPAs, she'll probably have the time of her life.

595
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:56,643
- 你怎麼辦呢  - 我不喜歡船
- What about you? - I hate boats.

596
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:59,895
其實  這下正好  我可以不去了
You wanna know the truth? I'm relieved.

597
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:04,668
- 我想這是條鱘魚  - 顯然不是
- I think this is sturgeon. - This is definitely not sturgeon.

598
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:10,131
- 這就像天鵝絨  - 蘇格蘭三文魚  上等貨色
- It's just like velvet. - Scottish salmon. The very best.

599
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:12,217
再來點香檳
More champagne?

600
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:16,321
- 產自自命不凡的加利福尼亞  不錯哦  - 你不是開玩笑吧  加利福尼亞
- For pretentious California, it's not half bad. - You're not kidding. California?

601
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:18,264
愚弄我吧
Could have fooled me.

602
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:23,645
- 噢  上帝  這才是生活  - 這才剛剛開始
- Oh, God. This is living. - And it's just beginning.

603
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:27,899
- 你能再說一遍嗎  - 這才剛剛開始
- You can say that again. - And it's just beginning.

604
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,609
感覺真好
Very good.

605
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:38,618
謝謝你
Thank you.

606
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:49,212
為您服務非常榮幸  要雞尾酒  還是香檳  或者
It's a pleasure to have you here. Can I get you a cocktail? Or some champagne, perhaps?

607
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,549
- 香檳好嗎  香檳  - 很好
- Champagne? Champagne. - Very good.

608
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:54,968
- 謝謝  - 謝謝
- Thank you. - Thank you.

609
00:50:55,136 --> 00:51:01,641
- 所以你決定不再做女演員了  - 是啊  我決定做女招待
- You decided not to become an actress? - Yeah. I decided to become a waitress.

610
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:04,352
我選擇了正確的女性職業
I had the "tress" part right.

611
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:09,441
- 我是個相當好的女招待 - 是啊  你做得很好
- And I was a great waitress. - The "tress" part.

612
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:11,317
我看到你買了那個地方
I saw you bought the place.

613
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,027
你看到了
You saw?

614
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:17,991
- 有一天我從門口經過  - 那你怎麼不進來
- I passed by the other day. - And you didn't come in?

615
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:23,698
呃  我  我不知道  我只是  我想你肯定很忙
Well, I.... I don't know, I just.... I figured you were busy.

616
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:28,276
你呀  你真應該進來  看看我怎麼做的
Please, you have to come in, you have to. You have to see what I did.

617
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:32,498
我還弄了一張以你的名字命名的飯桌  免費招待那些沒有錢的人
I established a table with your name on it, for people who couldn't afford a meal.

618
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,466
是嗎
No.

619
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:37,976
當然  在你做了那些事情之後  當然是的
Of course. After what you did. Of course.

620
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:43,116
我做什麼了  我只是履行了諾言  我一直都這樣
What I did? I made a promise and I kept it, period.

621
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:45,987
大多數人都會這樣做
Most people would've done the same.

622
00:51:45,989 --> 00:51:48,537
沒有人會這樣做
Nobody would've done the same.

623
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:54,360
你開玩笑呢  你所做的就像是一個童話
Are you kidding? What you did was like a fairy tale.

624
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:02,309
然後每個人都幸福快樂地生活著
And everyone gets to live happily ever after?

625
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:23,239
- 噢  這真是幸福的一對  - 你這麼看嗎
- Well, that's a hopeful sight. - You think?

626
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:25,259
我不知道
I don't know.

627
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:28,202
我總是想知道  他們準備好了嗎
I always wonder, what's in store for them?

628
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,371
他們會得到幸福嗎
Are they gonna be happy?

629
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:36,384
我的意思是  假如她胖上五十磅  他還會愛她嗎
I mean, if she puts on 50 pounds or something, will he love her anyway?

630
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:42,575
- 你結婚幾年了  - 三年了
- How long were you married? - Three years.

631
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:47,321
嫁了一個叫艾迪的演員
To an actor named Eddie.

632
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:52,919
他還提議如果我們有了孩子  就取名叫艾爾·帕西諾
Who suggested that if we had a child, we name him Al Pacino.

633
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:59,092
- 艾爾·帕西諾·比亞西  - 別逗了
- Al Pacino Biasi. - Come on.

634
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,094
我也這麼想
That's what I said.

635
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:22,448
穆麗兒和我是在高中的時候認識的  在一堂烹飪課上
Muriel and I met in high school, in one of those cooking classes...

636
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:25,176
在那所有人都穿得像廚子
...where all the guys dress up like Chef Boyardee.

637
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:28,114
每分鐘  都像是消防演習
And you figure any minute, there's gonna be a fire drill.

638
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:29,873
然後你就穿著圍裙逃到外面啦
And you're all outside in your aprons?

639
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:34,794
沒錯  直到現在  想起來都會打哆嗦
Exactly. Even now, thinking about it, I get chills.

640
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:38,975
總之  後來我們開始約會  而且
Anyhow, we started dating, and....

641
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,472
穆麗兒是我的初戀
Muriel was the first girl I ever....

642
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:51,685
- 真的嗎  - 真的
- Really? - Yeah.

643
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:57,358
- 噢  真甜蜜  - 我想是的
- Well, that's sweet. - I guess.

644
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:04,324
然後我們就一起去了婚姻許可登記處  那裏還有其它情侶
We went down to the marriage-license bureau, and I remember, there was this other couple there.

645
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:07,153
他們是東正教猶太人  還是包辦婚姻
They were Orthodox Jews. It was an arranged marriage.

646
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:08,988
包辦婚姻
An arranged marriage?

647
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:12,765
之前夫妻雙方都不准見面  他們都被親人圍著
They weren't allowed to see each other. They were surrounded by their families.

648
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:15,043
連互相瞥一眼都不可能
They couldn't get a glimpse of each other.

649
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:20,815
我就想  我的上帝  他們甚至不知道自己是否吸引對方
And I remember thinking, "My God. They don't even know if they're attracted to each other.

650
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:25,385
他們甚至不知道是否有共同的話題
They don't even know if they've got anything to talk about with each other."

651
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:32,358
然後  十年過去了  我敢打賭  他們現在有六個可愛的小孩  幸福地生活在一起
And here it is, ten years later, and I bet they're happily married with six cute little kids.

652
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:38,399
但是穆麗兒和我  現在沒話可說了  我不知道怎麼了
But Muriel and I have nothing to say to one another. I don't know what happened.

653
00:54:39,068 --> 00:54:44,983
就像我們是兩個不同的頻道  我是CNN新聞頻道  她是家庭購物頻道
It's like we're on two different channels now. I'm CNN, she's the Home Shopping Network.

654
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:11,891
我們跳一曲  怎麼樣
How would you feel about dancing?

655
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:18,898
噢  我很樂意
Oh, I'd be in favor of it.

656
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:43,149
我還是個新手的時候常值夜班  那時候  我感覺像在探險
When I was a rookie, I had the night shift, and I felt like an explorer.

657
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:47,878
整個紐約  是座不夜城
Because there's this whole other city that goes on all night long.

658
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:52,033
- 我是不是有點兒嘮叨  - 是啊
- Am I talking incessantly? - Yes.

659
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:55,286
但我喜歡  我自己就比較嘮叨
But I like it. I myself am a talker.

660
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:57,163
所以  沒什麼
So, I don't know.

661
00:56:57,331 --> 00:57:03,802
我喜歡跟那些談得來的人一起聊聊天散散步
It's nice to meet somebody who you can just talk with, you know, and hang with.

662
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:09,509
你瞧  這剛好  我現在基本上每天都閒著
Look, here's the thing. I'm free all the time, basically.

663
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,637
所以  如果你想做點什麼或是想聊天的話
So if there's anything you ever wanna do during the day...

664
00:57:12,805 --> 00:57:15,348
- 或是你獨自一人什麼也不想幹的時候  - 真的嗎
- ...or you're alone and you don't wanna be.... - Really?

665
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:19,268
- 當然  - 明天怎麼樣
- Sure. - How about tomorrow?

666
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,853
明天
Tomorrow?

667
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:23,856
- 太快了嗎  - 不  一點也不
- Too soon? - No, not at all.

668
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:29,195
好  太棒了  好吧  我讓卡洛兒看著店
Okay, great. Okay. So, I'll have Carol watch the register...

669
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:33,074
中午你就來接我  行嗎
...and you could come by, pick me up at noon?

670
00:57:33,242 --> 00:57:34,700
我會來的
I'll be there.

671
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,203
- 好啊  - 那就說定了
- Okay. - All right.

672
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:39,038
謝謝
Thank you.

673
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:43,668
- 晚安  - 晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

674
00:57:55,889 --> 00:58:01,227
嗨  不可思議  我以為錢包掉在外面了
Hi. Weirdest thing happened. I thought I'd dropped my wallet outside.

675
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:05,857
不可思議  我覺得有點暈船就到外面來了
Weirdest thing happened. I came outside because I was feeling a little seasick.

676
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,405
真是不可思議
Weirdest thing happened.

677
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,031
我有一些好點子
I have some wonderful ideas.

678
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,075
- 如果你真想  - 嗨
- Specifically with you in mind. - Hi.

679
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:18,035
真是奇怪了
Weirdest thing happened.

680
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:20,663
牛肉怎麼樣
Wasn't the veal fabulous?

681
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:26,294
好極了  真奇怪  我不怎麼喜歡牛肉  我更喜歡雞肉
Fabulous. That was what was so weird. I didn't expect veal. I expected chicken.

682
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:30,206
我本來是要找你的  但格羅斯先生在這裏
I would have come sit with you, but Mr. Gross here....

683
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:32,084
- 傑克·格羅斯  - 很高興認識你
- Jack Gross. - My pleasure.

684
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:33,919
很高興認識你  警官
Pleased to meet you, officer.

685
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:37,987
查理  他說要幫我們賺錢
Charlie, he's going to help us develop an economic strategy.

686
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:43,644
- 好主意  - 是你太太提出的  警官  她很聰明
- What a great idea. - You have some girl here, officer. Smart.

687
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:48,774
而且漂亮  她知道自己想要的東西
Beautiful. And she knows what she wants.

688
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,986
- 看到了吧  - 我同意
- See? - I agree.

689
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:56,382
非常感謝你  今晚你令我大開眼界  格羅斯先生
Thank you very much for a very stimulating evening, Mr. Gross.

690
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:58,321
這是我的榮幸
My pleasure.

691
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:02,955
- 如果你需要什麼建議  無論你  - 我會打給你的
- If you ever need any advice, either of you.... - I will be calling.

692
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:07,710
- 好嗎  - 當然
- Well, ready? - Sure.

693
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:10,129
走吧  我們上樓去拿我的大衣
Come on, let's get upstairs. I gotta get my coat.

694
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:12,798
- 再見  - 再見
- Bye-bye. - Bye-bye.

695
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,649
噢  不行
Oh, no.

696
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:33,986
- 你做得不錯  - 我從來掌握不好平衡
- You're doing great. - I never had great balance.

697
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:38,441
我試過滑雪  結果從皮特兔子斜坡上摔了下來
I tried skiing once. They threw me off the Peter Rabbit slope.

698
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:43,079
- 注意彎曲膝蓋  問題就在這兒  - 這只是其中一個毛病
- You gotta bend your knees. That's your problem. - That's one of them.

699
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:49,710
小心  這裏有個小坡  你要注意  別
So now, there's a little bit of a hill here, so you might want to watch it, so don't--

700
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:52,838
- 減速  - 我慢不下來
- Slow down. - I can't slow down.

701
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:56,342
- 你行的  - 我行的  我不行
- Sure you can. - Sure I can-- I can't.

702
01:00:00,889 --> 01:00:04,341
- 查理  轉彎  - 我知道
- Charlie, turn. - Okay.

703
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:14,360
- 你還好吧  - 很好
- Are you okay? - Fine.

704
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:19,799
我也許會因為浸水而得上麻風病  不過  此外就沒事了
I mean, I'll probably catch leprosy from the water, but otherwise I'm okay.

705
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:25,329
我想你是再也不想溜旱冰了
So I guess this is it for you and rollerblading?

706
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:27,081
我剛想說來著
I would have to say yes.

707
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:34,880
好了  輪到你了  下面你打算幹嘛
Okay, your turn. What next? What do you want to do?

708
01:00:42,264 --> 01:00:46,934
女士們先生們  我是查理·蘭  我買彩票中了獎
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Charlie Lang, and I've just won the lottery.

709
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:51,439
今晚乘車  由我和伊芳·比亞西小姐  為大家買票
Tonight's ride home is on me and Miss Yvonne Biasi.

710
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:02,491
- 出什麼事了  - 警察和女招待請大家免費乘車
- What's going on? - The cop and the waitress are treating everybody.

711
01:01:14,755 --> 01:01:18,007
- 沒有比這更好的事了  - 我能想到更好的
-This is going to be hard to top. - I'll top it.

Not Officer Krupke, the saintly cop?

737
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:39,334
我和他之間什麼也沒有發生  而且他也不是什麼聖人
There's nothing going on between me and Charlie Lang. And he's not a saint...

738
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:44,223
他只是一個普通的體面人  你這種人一輩子也不可能做到

- 你跟這個姑娘在搞婚外情嗎  - 沒有  當然沒有  我們只是一起出去
- Are you having an affair with this girl? - No, of course not. We just hang out together.

741
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:58,030
你真應該聽聽樓下那個俄羅斯婆子說的  你丈夫和女招待如何如何
You should've heard that Russian bitch downstairs, "Oh, your husband and that waitress."

742
01:05:58,038 --> 01:06:00,038
但是  好了  我們到底在這爭論什麼
But, okay, what's the real issue here?

743
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:03,984
我們之間是怎麼回事  樓下那些傻瓜鄰居又與我們何干
What's happening between us, or what some idiot neighbor thinks?

744
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:08,105
這裏就像冷戰似的  每當我想跟你談談  你總是
It's been like a cold war here. And every time I've tried to talk about it, you--

745
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:13,402
- 我所做的只是想讓你開心  - 不  你根本沒有那樣做
- All I have done is tried to make you happy. - No, that's not all you've tried to do.

746
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:17,172
以前我晚上回來  你總是跑過來擁抱我
I used to come home at night, and you'd throw your arms around me.

747
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:21,470
你吻我  還問我今天過得怎樣  你上次這樣做是什麼時候？
You'd kiss me and say, "How was your day?" When's the last time that happened?

748
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,018
五年前嗎
Five years ago?

749
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:26,225
- 我想不起來了  這不重要  - 不  這很重要
- I have no idea. It's not important. - No, but it is important.

750
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,434
已經成為歷史了
It's history.

751
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:31,870
- 你現在圍著那個女孩轉  - 我沒有和她搞婚外情
- You go around with this girl. - I'm not having an affair.

752
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:36,874
你跟那個警察的事  坦率地說我並不關心
This thing between you and the cop, frankly, it's none of my business.

753
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:41,543
但是有一件非常重要的事情  那就是
But there is one thing that's very important, and it's this.

754
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:43,248
別害怕
Don't be afraid.

You want money. Of course you want money.

757
01:06:57,514 --> 01:07:00,592
僅僅只要五萬塊  然後我們就互不相干
Just 50 grand in seed money. And then we're off and running.

758
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,762
好吧  寶貝兒  看  在這兒  簽字吧
Okay, honey, look. Picture this, picture this. Please, please.

759
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:09,059
當然沒有  你沒有  聖人先生沒有  你太神聖了  不會發生婚外情
Of course not. Not you, not Mr. Saintly. You're too good to have an affair.

760
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:13,355
噢  上帝  查理  我受夠了你所謂的正派禮儀
Oh, God, Charlie. I'm just so sick of it. Your niceness and your decency.

761
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:14,863
但是你知道你是什麼嗎
But you wanna know what?

762
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:20,160
你什麼都不是  你只是個會打工的笨蛋  一輩子都是藍領
You're nothing. You're a working-class stiff. You are blue collar all the way.

763
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,169
我不想改變  穆麗兒
I'm not gonna change, Muriel.

- So I want a divorce. - You want a divorce?

766
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:45,686
越快越好
As soon as possible.

767
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:49,898
我的翅膀硬了  查理  我要單飛
I have wings, Charlie. I want to fly.

768

As they say in Hollywood, let's cut to the chase.

834
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,874
彩票獎金  我們認為不應該分
It is our contention that there be no division of the lottery money.

835
01:15:30,902 --> 01:15:32,604
因為這是蘭太太的彩票
This was Mrs. Lang's ticket.

836
01:15:32,612 --> 01:15:36,281
- 這是完全不能接受的  - 我接受
- That's completely unacceptable. - It's all right.

837
01:15:37,325 --> 01:15:40,317
- 她可以拿走我的那一半  - 什麼
- She can have my half. - What?

838
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:43,954
過來
Come here.

839
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:50,170
你是傻子嗎  你為什麼不爭取就放棄
Are you nuts? Why are you giving this away without a fight?

840
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:53,965
她拿走我那一半好了  就這樣吧  我不想再討論這個問題
She can have my half, period. I don't wanna discuss it.

841
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:56,801
不想討論這個問題  你所說的是一百萬美元啊
Don't wanna discuss it? You're talking a million dollars.

842
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:58,637
沃爾特  行了
Walter, please.

843
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:01,014
你在跟我開玩笑吧
You gotta be kidding me.

844
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:07,812
- 在這一點上我們讓步  - 這是非常成熟慎重的態度
- We concede the point. - That's a very mature attitude.

845
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:10,649
這肯定會讓問題盡快正確解決
It'll certainly help speed things right along.

846
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:15,070
那麼  現在  關於他們中彩前的財產
Well, now, as to their pre-lottery holdings...

847
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:18,657
這裏有份銀行賬戶清單
...we have a bank account here totaling...

848
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:26,957
一共有三千六百一十一美元  我建議對半分
...$3611. I insist we split this 50-50.

849
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:30,752
傻瓜開竅了啊
Chump change.

850
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:38,760
好  基本就是這樣  還有一些傢俱 一些亞麻布被單
Well, that's basically it. There's furnishings, some good linens.

851
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:42,013
這些不太重要  查庫圖先生
Not quite accurate, Mr. Zakuto.

852
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:49,187
我們要討論一下  蘭先生分給比亞西小姐的款項
We are also attaching the monies given by Mr. Lang to Miss Biasi.

853
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:52,190
- 什麼  不行  - 這太過分了
- What? No. - That is out of bounds.

854
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:56,100
蘭先生未經妻子同意
Mr. Lang volunteered his wife's earnings from the lottery...

855
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:58,405
擅自處理蘭太太的彩票所得
...without her consent or previous knowledge.

856
01:16:58,698 --> 01:17:03,535
這太過分了  穆麗兒  看在上帝的份上  想想你在做什麼
That's horrible, Muriel. For God's sake. Please, think about what you're doing.

857
01:17:03,703 --> 01:17:06,489
我們有理由相信  他和比亞西小姐
We have every reason to believe that he and Miss Biasi...

858
01:17:06,497 --> 01:17:08,331
有著長期的情人關係
...have had a long-standing relationship...

859
01:17:08,499 --> 01:17:12,000
然後他故意欺騙了他的妻子
...that he deliberately deceived his wife about.

860
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:13,211
為此
And toward that end...

861
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:16,781
- 我們已經起草了針對比亞西小姐的訴訟單  - 卑鄙
- ...we have drafted this letter to Miss Biasi... - Come on!

862
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:18,950
要求她歸還這筆錢
...demanding that she return the money...

863
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:22,654
立即全部歸還  否則將面臨巨額賠償和罰款
...immediately and in full, or face substantial penalties and damages.

864
01:17:22,722 --> 01:17:27,825
- 簡直難以置信  - 我無法再忍受他大叫大鬧了
- I can't believe this. - I can't listen to this screaming.

865
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:30,889
- 我們的婚姻一直這樣  - 事實並不是這樣
- Our whole marriage was like this. - It was not like this!

866
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:32,515
你為什麼要這樣做
Why are you doing this?

867
01:17:32,523 --> 01:17:35,600
你想從伊芳那裏得到什麼  她沒做錯任何事
Just to get even with Yvonne? She didn't do anything wrong.

868
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:40,947
我已經對你的虐待感到麻木了  你們看見了嗎
I am tired of this physical abuse from you. Did you see that?

869
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:48,329
如果你們要一輛出租車  我的秘書會幫你們
If you fellows need a cab, my secretary will call one.

870
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:53,828
我應該怎麼和伊芳說呢  我該怎麼告訴她呢
How am I going to say this to Yvonne? How am I gonna tell her?

871
01:17:53,836 --> 01:18:00,091
查理  這樣不行  這段時間你必須停止和她見面
Charlie, you're not gonna like this, but you're gonna have to stop seeing her for a while.

872
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:06,846
嗨  我是伊芳·比亞西  現在不在家
Hi. This is Yvonne Biasi. I'm not at home right now.

873
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:10,101
請在嗶聲後留言  非常感謝
Please leave a message after the beep. Thanks so much.

874
01:18:11,771 --> 01:18:15,315
伊芳  我只想說我很擔心你
Yvonne, I just wanted to say I'm thinking about you.

875
01:18:15,483 --> 01:18:20,445
我們會贏的  因為我們是對的  別認為這是你的錯  根本不是
And we're gonna win this thing, because it's right. Don't think any of this is your fault. It isn't.

876
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:26,576
我在鮑的家裏  有事就打555-3840  看來我只能在法庭上再見到你了
If you need me, I'll be at Bo's, 555-3840. I guess I'll see you in court.

877
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:30,263
希望你不介意睡在地板上
Well, I hope you don't mind sleeping on the floor.

878
01:18:30,331 --> 01:18:31,783
噢  當然不會  謝謝
Oh, no, thank you.

879
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:34,058
冰箱裏有啤酒  電視機在那裏
There's beer in the fridge, and the TV's there.

880
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:37,187
特蕾西  謝謝你讓我用你的毛毯
Sure is nice of you to let me use your Barney blanket, Tracey.

881
01:18:37,254 --> 01:18:39,363
這沒關係
That's okay.

882
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:42,984
- 晚安  - 晚安  蓋爾  我很抱歉
- Good night. - Good night, Gail. I'm sorry.

883
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:45,261
別擔心  哥們
Don't worry about it, man.

884
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:48,264
謝謝
Thanks.

885
01:19:02,822 --> 01:19:06,150
這個轟動全城的訴訟
"The trial, which has attracted citywide interest...

886
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:09,862
將於今天上午九點半在民事法庭開庭審理
...begins in civil court this morning at 9:30."

887
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:12,740
- 整件事情都太離奇了  - 我相信錢會歸伊芳
- This whole thing is unbelievable. - My money's on Yvonne.

888
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:15,766
上帝  我也希望如此
God, I hope so.

889
01:19:15,835 --> 01:19:19,963
蘭太太  請問你的生日是哪天
Now, Mrs. Lang, what are the numbers for your birthday?

890
01:19:20,131 --> 01:19:22,006
64年12月16日

01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:26,845
64年12月16日
Twelve, 16, 64.

892
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:32,851
那麼結婚紀念日呢  親愛的
And the numbers for your anniversary, my dear?

893

84年6月26日
Six, 26, 84.

894
01:19:39,358 --> 01:19:42,026
6月26日
Six, 26....

895
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,864
我聽到的是26嗎
Did I hear 26?

896
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,193
二十六嗎
Twenty-six?

897
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:53,830
而事實上  蘭太太  你不是27號結婚的嗎
As a matter of fact, Mrs. Lang, weren't you married on the 27th?

898
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:59,878
- 是的  - 所以  是你丈夫自己選擇的26
- Yes. - So your husband picked the 26 on his own?

899
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:05,258
- 反對  這問題有什麼意義  - 關鍵在於  辯護律師
- Objection. What's the point? - The point is, counselor...

900
01:20:05,426 --> 01:20:08,970
重點是  法官大人  我將證明
...the point is, Your Honor, I am demonstrating...

901
01:20:09,138 --> 01:20:14,642
是因為蘭先生的選擇  彩票才中了獎
...that Mr. Lang is responsible for the winning ticket.

902
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:16,394
反對無效
Overruled.

903
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:24,944
那麼  蘭太太  是你的丈夫自己選擇了屬於他的26號  對嗎
So, Mrs. Lang, your husband picked the 26th on his own, correct?

904
01:20:25,112 --> 01:20:28,156
- 不對  - 不對嗎
- No. - No?

905
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:33,745
蘭太太  當時你和你丈夫在一起
Mrs. Lang, there was you, there was your husband.

906
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:38,583
你可以告訴我們  那天早上還有誰和你們在一起嗎
Could you kindly tell us who else was there that morning?

907
01:20:44,757 --> 01:20:47,358
我死去的父親
My dead father.

908
01:20:51,347 --> 01:20:56,518
- 抱歉 能說清楚些嗎  - 我死去的父親  上帝寬恕他的靈魂
- Excuse me? - My dead father, God rest his soul.

909
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:57,936
請肅靜
Quiet, please.

910
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:03,775
他進入我的夢裏  他邊說邊飄上窗口  寶貝兒
He came to me in a dream. "Baby," he says, as he was floating out the window.

911
01:21:03,943 --> 01:21:06,986
他有一雙大翅膀  你知道  像天使一樣的翅膀
You know, he had these big wings, you know, like angel wings.

912
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:10,882
噢  我的上帝啊  穿著完美的白色長袍
Oh, my God. They were the perfect color of white leather.

913
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:13,952
他說  寶貝兒  該去教堂了
Anyway, he says, "Baby, it's time to go to the church.

914
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:16,614
你得快點  否則你就要遲到了
You gotta hurry up or you're gonna be late."

915
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:22,210
太讓我震驚了  那時我正穿著婚紗站在那兒
To my shock and surprise, I'm standing there in my wedding gown.

916
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:25,321
所以我跑過了皇后大街  穿過弗拉特布什大街
So I was running down Queen's Boulevard, through Flatbush.

917
01:21:25,339 --> 01:21:28,608
跑過皇后大街  穿過了弗拉特布什大街之後
Even though Queen's Boulevard doesn't run through Flatbush.

918
01:21:28,676 --> 01:21:33,304
我來到教堂  好來樂透的聖凱瑟琳教堂
I came to the church: St. Catherine's of the Holy Lotto.

919
01:21:34,098 --> 01:21:39,644
我不但沒有遲到  還早到了整整一天
And then I realized I wasn't late, I was a whole day early.

920
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,647
天啊  我真該死
God, I wanted to die.

921
01:21:42,815 --> 01:21:47,151
他在那裏  知道嗎  我父親就站在我邊上
Then my father, you know, he was there, he was standing right next to me.

922
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:51,030
他說  孩子  別哭
And he says, "Little girl, don't cry.

923
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:58,037
對我來說  你的結婚紀念日就是26號
Because to me, your anniversary will always be on the 26th."

你為你太太買過指甲油嗎
Have you ever purchased nail-polish remover for your wife?

927
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:19,642
肅靜
Quiet, please.

928
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:25,889
洗甲水呢
Nail-polish remover?

929
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:29,353
- 我想有幾次吧  - 你付錢買的嗎
- A couple of times, I guess. - And you paid for it?

930
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:33,896
- 當然  - 因此你就認為它們就是屬於你的啦
- Sure. - Did you therefore consider it yours?

931
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:38,368
不  我不這麼想
No, I guess I didn't.

Isn't it true that you forced your wife to split the ticket with Miss Biasi?

933
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:46,978
我只是說  我們應該做正確的事
I only said we should do the right thing.

934
01:22:47,046 --> 01:22:52,425

- Mr. Lang, were you wearing a gun at the time? - No. Of course not.

935
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:57,321
- 你打她了  是嗎  蘭先生  - 我沒有  從來沒有
- You hit her, didn't you, Mr. Lang? - I never, ever--

936
01:22:57,389 --> 01:23:00,974
你可是宣過誓的  蘭先生
You are under oath, Mr. Lang.

937
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:07,231
- 好吧  有一次我抓住她的胳膊  - 沒有其它問題了
- Okay, once I grabbed her arm-- - No further questions.

...before Mr. Lang was kind enough to offer you half his wife's winning ticket?

理論上來說  是的  但我從來沒有透支過
Technically, yes. But that's not because I had overspent.

是的  不過  那只是巧合
Yes. But that was just fate.

949
01:24:00,828 --> 01:24:05,039
- 是啊  巧合  - 是的  真的
- Right, fate. - Yes. Really.

01:24:15,843 --> 01:24:18,636
是真的
Yes, really.

954
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:22,724
描述一下現在你和蘭先生的關係
Describe your relationship with Mr. Lang today.

955
01:24:27,771 --> 01:24:31,189
我愛他  勝過世間的一切
I love him more than anything in the world.

956
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:34,752
所以那天你去酒店和他會面
Which is why you went running off to the Plaza with him...

957
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:36,982
這也是他離開他太太的原因
...on the day he separated from his wife.

958
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:40,992
- 反對  這有什麼關係  - 動機
- Objection. What is the relevancy of this? - Motivation.

959
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,870
什麼動機
What motivation?

960
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:48,207
蘭太太把他趕出家門  婚姻走到盡頭了
Mrs. Lang had thrown Mr. Lang out of the house, the marriage was in complete disarray.

961
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:50,703
- 反對無效  - 如果你是暗示我是個
- Overruled. - If you're implying what I think--

962
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:51,954
比亞西小姐
Miss Biasi.

963
01:24:51,962 --> 01:24:54,992
他們企圖把我說成是一個騙子  他  還有媒體
They're trying to make me into a gold digger. Him, the media.

964
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:57,543
比亞西小姐  請控制一下情緒
Miss Biasi. Control yourself, please.

965
01:24:57,551 --> 01:25:02,513
我一直都在努力工作  終於意外地迎來異常奇妙的一刻
I've worked my whole life. And finally something wonderful happened to me.

966
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:07,658
我遇到了一個聰明  善良而且充滿愛心的男人
I met a man who was intelligent and kind and full of compassion.

967
01:25:07,686 --> 01:25:11,515
認識他已經改變了我的生活  這絕不是錢的問題
Just the experience of knowing him has changed my life. It's not the money.

968
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:16,187
這是因為他使我  再次從根本上相信  人性依然是善良的
It's because he made me believe again people were fundamentally decent.

969
01:25:16,195 --> 01:25:20,521
我不想讓什麼律師  歪曲我們的關係  醜化這份感情
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let some lawyer make our relationship look ugly.

970
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:22,200
你離婚了嗎
Are you divorced?

971
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:25,870
沒有
No.

972
01:25:26,038 --> 01:25:29,240
就是說你和一個人結婚了  卻又愛上另一個
You're married to one man, and you're in love with another.

973
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:34,462
- 這只是因為我付不起離婚費用  - 好啊 這理由方便
- It's only because I couldn't afford to get divorced. - Well, that's convenient.

974
01:25:36,465 --> 01:25:42,153
在戲劇性的證詞裏  伊芳·比亞西被穆麗兒的律師描述成
In dramatic testimony, Yvonne Biasi was depicted by Muriel Lang's attorney...

975
01:25:42,221 --> 01:25:48,391
一個淫蕩的金錢詐騙犯  本案預計今天晚上作出裁決
...as a gold-digger and nymphomaniac. A verdict was expected by this evening.

976
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:53,773
- 陪審團作出裁決了嗎  - 是的  法官大人
- Has the jury reached a verdict? - We have, Your Honor.

977
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:11,582
宣讀吧
What say you?

978
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:17,088
我們一致認為  原告穆麗兒·蘭太太勝訴
We rule in favor of the plaintiff, Mrs. Muriel Lang, on all counts.

979
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:22,510
法庭對陪審團在這困難的情況下所作的努力表示感謝
The court would like to thank the jury for its service in this difficult case.

980
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:25,429
退庭
Court is dismissed.

981
01:26:47,953 --> 01:26:51,289
- 關於你和伊芳的通姦  - 別再侮辱她
- About the reports of Yvonne's adultery-- - Shut up about her.

982
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:53,207
她在下面
She's down there.

983
01:26:55,502 --> 01:26:57,628
伊芳
Yvonne!

984
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:08,306
伊芳
Yvonne!

985
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:13,686
- 蘭太太  你對裁決有什麼看法  - 非常公正
- Mrs. Lang? Your reaction to the verdict? - Justice was done.

986
01:27:13,854 --> 01:27:16,522
難道你不認為你丈夫所做的是好事嗎
Don't you believe that the good deeds of your husband--?

987
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:20,526
這不是記者招待會  法庭的裁決很公正  我們很高興  就這樣
This is not a press conference. The verdict is in. We're happy, that's all.

988
01:27:20,694 --> 01:27:21,736
非常滿意
Very happy.

989
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:31,800
「警察與女招待敗訴」

990
01:29:16,476 --> 01:29:18,853
我都不知道她在哪裏
I don't even know where she is.

991
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:26,027
瞧  你還可以回來做警察  這是你喜歡的事
Look, you'll be a cop again. It's what you love.

992
01:29:27,446 --> 01:29:29,280
我會沒事的
I'll be all right.

993
01:29:30,866 --> 01:29:32,742
我會沒事的
I'll be all right.

994
01:30:10,489 --> 01:30:12,448
有人嗎
Hello?

995
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:17,161
有人在嗎
Is anyone here?

996
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:20,664
走吧
Go away.

997
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:23,167
伊芳
Yvonne.

998
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:27,838
- 不  你不會想再和我在一起的  - 你說什麼呢
- No. You don't wanna be with me. - What are you talking about?

999
01:30:31,009 --> 01:30:35,596
- 我愛你  - 不  你還不明白嗎
- I love you. - No. Don't you get it?

1000
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:37,181
我毀了你的生活
I've ruined your life.

1001
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:42,853
你瘋了嗎  沒有你在的這些日子  我感覺自己像丟了魂似的
Are you crazy? These past couple of days, I felt like half of me was missing.

1002
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:49,693
你中了四百萬美元啊  你知道這是多麼驚人的一份厚禮嗎
You won $4 million in the lottery. Do you know what an amazing gift that is?

1003
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:53,030
而現在  因為我  你什麼都沒有了
And because of me you have nothing.

1004
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:57,952
正是因為你  我愛你  難道你還不明白嗎
Because of you, I have you. Why can't you understand that?

1005
01:30:59,788 --> 01:31:01,914
如果你不想要我  這是另一回事
If you don't want me, that's different.

1006
01:31:02,082 --> 01:31:06,377
如果你不要我  我會走出這道門  你永遠都不會再見到我
If you don't want me, I'll walk right out that door, and you'll never see me again.

1007
01:31:06,545 --> 01:31:12,550
但是別再說什麼錢  錢對我沒有任何意義
But please stop talking about the money. It means nothing to me.

1008
01:31:19,975 --> 01:31:21,100
你希望我走嗎
Do you want me to go?

1009
01:31:27,274 --> 01:31:29,024
不
No.

1010
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:34,238
永遠不
Never.

1011
01:31:37,075 --> 01:31:38,576
永遠別走  永遠
Never, never.

1012
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:47,626
有些時候你該原諒我  因為
You have to excuse me sometimes, it's just...

1013
01:31:48,336 --> 01:31:51,380
從來沒有人這樣愛過我
...nobody ever loved me before.

1014
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:30,044
- 我想他可能想找點吃的  - 我們讓他進來吧
- I guess he wants some food. - Shall we invite him in?

1015
01:32:32,005 --> 01:32:33,339
為什麼不呢
Why not?

1016
01:32:56,154 --> 01:32:58,530
我們應該離開紐約
We should leave New York.

1017
01:33:01,034 --> 01:33:03,535
我的意思是  我們在這裏都成怪物了
I mean, we're like freaks here.

1018
01:33:06,873 --> 01:33:10,960
我有個遠親住在水牛城
I've got a cousin that lives in Buffalo.

1019
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:13,504
他一直叫我過去
He keeps asking me to visit.

1020
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:17,132
也許我們可以在那兒呆上一陣子
Maybe we can stay there for a while.

1021
01:33:17,968 --> 01:33:20,594
我可以在水牛城當警察
I could join the Buffalo force.

1022
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:26,976
我可以在水牛城做女招待
I could be a Buffalo waitress.

1023

Even in their darkest hour, the stalwart Officer Lang and the good-hearted Miss Biasi...

1028
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:08,851
仍然讓我享受了一碗美味的熱湯
...shared a bowl of soup with me.

1029
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:14,148
臨走時  這位好心人還從他口袋裏掏錢給我
When I left, this Good Samaritan gave me money from his own pocket...

1030
01:34:14,357 --> 01:34:16,984
還希望我別嫌少
...wishing it could be more.

1031

- 請寄往摩爾北街  伊芳咖啡館  - 這是一個好主意
- "Mail it to Yvonne's Coffee Shop." - It's a good idea.

It's a great idea.

1033

- I knew this was a bad idea. - No, I just wanted to see it again.

It took Charlie and Yvonne three days to open all their mail.
