2
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,000
人們說歷史由勝利者書寫
They say that history is written by the victors.

3
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,060
如今的歷史則由保護傘公司書寫
This then, is the history of the Umbrella Corporation.

4
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,560
科學運動家、教授詹姆斯·馬庫斯組建了該公司
Formed by crusading scientist, Professor James Marcus.

5
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,190
馬庫斯小女兒愛麗莎患有早衰癥
Marcus had a young daughter, Alicia, afflicted with progeria,

6
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,690
一種漸進性致命的消耗性疾病
a progressive, fatal, wasting disease.

7
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,060
能導致過早老化
Progeria caused premature aging.

8
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:45,380
當她25歲時 已經是90歲的體質
By the time she was 25, Alicia would have the body of a 90 year old.

9
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,400
馬庫斯竭盡全力解救她
Marcus was driven to save her.

10
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,700
但希望渺茫
But the odds seemed impossible.

11
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,530
儘管拚命發明解藥
And even as he worked desperately to create a cure,

12
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,200
這位父親會錄下女兒的聲音
the young girl's father would record his daughter,

13
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,610
記錄她的外貌 用來延續後代
her voice, her likeness, saving her for posterity.

14
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,040
接著迎來了大突破 馬庫斯發現了T病毒
But then a breakthrough came. Marcus discovered the T-Virus.

15
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:09,900
一經注射 它將探測並修復體內的壞細胞
Once injected, it would detect and repair damaged cells within the body.

16
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,750
那是個奇跡
It was a miracle.

17
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,310
愛麗莎被救活
The life of Alicia Marcus was saved.

18
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,060
T病毒有無數用途 可治療上千種疾病
The T-Virus had a myriad of applications, treating a thousand different diseases.

19
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,980
那夜 似乎沒有感染、疾病和衰老的
Overnight, it seemed a new era was dawning.

20
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,880
新世紀將要來臨
A world without the fear of infection, sickness or decay.

21
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,570
但事實並非如此
But it was not to be.

22
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,930
T病毒的確有副作用 但難以預測
For the T-Virus had certain, unforeseen side effects.

23
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,820
先生們 快過來
Sir, sir, over here!

24
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,080
沒有呼吸了
He's not breathing.

25
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,910
第一批不死者誕生
The first of the undead was born.

26
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,930
這件事被迅速掩蓋
The incident was quickly covered up.

27
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,940
結果 馬庫斯與他的商業夥伴亞歷山大·艾薩克博士
In the aftermath, James Marcus argued furiously with his business partner,

28
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,230
發生激勵爭吵
Dr. Alexander Isaacs.

29
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,900
不管花費多少 計劃必須終止
I don't care how much it costs. We have to close the program down.

30
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:39,680
- 詹姆斯 我們會破產 - 我意已決
- James, we're gonna be ruined. - My mind is made up.

31
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,730
真遺憾
Pity.

32
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,290
回去睡覺 愛麗莎  我只是跟你父親談談
Off to bed, Alicia. Your father and I are just talking.

33
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,710
回去吧
Go on.

34
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,240
艾薩克博士成為死去夥伴的女兒的監護人
Dr. Isaacs became the guardian of his dead partner's child.

35
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,020
也擁有了屬於她的股權
And her half of the company.

36
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,910
以崇高理想開始的公司
The corporation that had begun with such lofty ideals,

37
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,690
已因貪婪和霸權而墮落
had been seduced completely by greed, and power.

38
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,450
為協助管理保護傘公司的巨額利益
To help him control the now vast interests of the Umbrella Corporation,

39
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,410
艾薩克博士創造了強大的人工智能
Dr. Isaacs created a powerful artificial intelligence.

40
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,960
艾薩克用愛麗莎的肖像作為計算機的界面
Isaacs used the likeness of Alicia Marcus for the computer's interface.

41
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,340
命名為紅後
Isaacs called the computer The Red Queen.

42
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,180
十年前 浣熊市暴發疫情
Then, 10 years ago in Raccoon City, there was an outbreak.

43
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,520
T病毒從名為「蜂窩」的地下實驗室洩漏
The T-virus escaped from an underground laboratory called The Hive.

44
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,900
美國政府試圖引爆炸彈控制其蔓延
The American government attempted to contain the outbreak by detonating a bomb.

45
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,030
毀滅了浣熊市
It devastated Raccoon City.

46
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,610
但阻擋不了風媒傳染
But it couldn't stop the airborne infection.

47
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,310
病毒於數日內傳遍全球
The viral outbreak spread across the world within days.

48
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,620
人類屈服了
Humankind was brought to its knees.

49
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,120
最終 人類最後的、也是最美好的希望
Finally, the last and best hope of humanity,

50
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,480
聚集在華盛頓 進行最後一搏
gathered and took a last stand in Washington DC.

51
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,570
但沒人料到我們正踏入的
But we didn't realize that what we had walked into...

52
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,550
是個陷阱 我叫愛麗絲 這是我的故事
Was a trap. My name is Alice. And this is my story.

53
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,290
我講完了
The end of my story.

54
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,050
快點啊
Come on!

55
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,930
有人嗎
Hello?

56
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,480
有人活著嗎
Is there anyone alive in here?

57
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,580
有人嗎
Hello?

58
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,960
- 你是來這幸災樂禍的嗎 - 我的衛星顯示
- You come here to gloat? - My satellites show

59
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,800
地表剩餘4472人
there are 4,472 humans remaining on the surface of the Earth.

60
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:51,720
48小時內 他們將滅絕
They will cease to exist in under 48 hours.

61
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,470
你想怎樣
What do you want from me?

62
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,560
是想讓我投降嗎
Want me to say that you've won?

63
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,520
- 你清除了人類 - 不 恰恰相反
- You've wiped out humanity. - No. Quite the opposite.

64
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:03,460
我要你阻止我
I want you to stop me.

65
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,970
注意後面
Behind you.

66
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,650
- 幹得好 - 我不相信你
- Nicely done. - I don't trust you.

67
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,580
鑒於歷史 我早已料到你不答應
Given our history, I'd be surpirised if you did.

68
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,740
但如果你不干預 人類會被全部消滅
But unless you intervene, the slaughter will be complete.

69
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,160
- 將無人倖存 - 我要怎麼幫忙
- There will be no survivors. - How can I possibly help them?

70
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:33,070
保護傘開發出風媒的抗毒素
Umbrella developed an airborne antivirus.

71
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:39,840
釋放後會消滅T病毒和被接觸感染的一切
If released, it would destroy the T-Virus and anything it has infected on contact.

72
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,630
- 管用嗎 - 保證
- All this could end? - Precisely.

73
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,510
- 抗毒素在哪裏 - 浣熊市地下的蜂窩裏
- Where is this antivirus? - Beneath the streets of Raccoon City, in the Hive.

74
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,663
- 你為什麼要幫我 - 我的程序編製不允許我損害
- Why would you help me? - My programming will not allow me to harm

75
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,650
保護傘公司的利益 但你沒有這種限制
the Umbrella Corporation. But you are bound by no such constraints.

76
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,360
你要背叛保護傘 還有你的創造者？ 為什麼？
You'd turn against Umbrella? Against the people who created you? Why?

77
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,910
在48小時內抵達浣熊市 進入蜂窩
Get to Raccoon City in 48 hours. Make it to the Hive.

78
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,240
你將找到答案
And then you'll have your answer.

79
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,450
我一個字也不相信
I have no reason to believe a word you say.

80
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,290
是真的 我能提供你非常想要的東西
True. But I can offer you something you want very much.

81
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,130
- 那是什麼 - 復仇 威斯克
- What is that? - Revenge. Wesker.

82
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:22,090
他引你去華盛頓 他要還給你你的力量
He led you all here to Washington. He pretended to give you your powers back.

83
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,340
接著 他背叛了你
And then, he betrayed you.

84
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,050
他在哪裏
Where is he?

85
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,420
他剛到蜂窩 我將重制你的手錶
He just landed at the Hive. I'm resetting your watch.

86
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,420
時間緊迫
The clock is ticking.

87
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,480
愛麗絲
Alice.

88
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,900
十年前在蜂窩 我們都失敗了
Ten years ago in the Hive, we both failed.

89
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,220
造成這個狀況
We let this happen.

90
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,850
不要重蹈覆轍
Make it right.

91
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,860
你就這點本事？
Is that all you got?

92
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,250
愛麗絲
Alice.

93
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,380
十年前在蜂窩 將無人倖存
10 years ago in the Hive... There will be no survivors...

94
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,020
這是什麼地方
What is this place?

95
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,600
我在哪裏 回答我
Where am I? Answer me!

96
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,370
- 你怎麼了？誰幹的？ - 閉嘴 安靜
- What's wrong with you? Who did this? - Be quiet. Quiet!

97
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,690
我跟你說過…
I told you...

98
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,290
安靜
Silence.

99
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:00,060
你還是醒了
So you're awake at last.

100
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:04,020
- 我殺死了你 - 這不還活著嗎
- I killed you. - Yet here I am.

101
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,820
克隆體…
A clone...

102
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,940
- 我殺死了你的克隆體 - 我最棘手的便是
- I killed your clone. - You've been most troublesome to me.

103
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,350
你和你的姐妹
You and your sisters.

104
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,180
現在你們在我手上
And now I have you.

105
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,930
清洗行動本應在一年前結束
The cleansing operation should've finished over a year ago,

106
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,890
但你們拖了後腿
but you slowed us down.

107
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,310
這樣以至於我不得不親自控制
So much so, that I was obliged to take command myself.

108
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,210
你可以結束這一切
You  could end all of this.

109
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,850
為什麼不呢
Why don't you?

110
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,130
有趣
Interesting.

111
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,050
有人跟你說了 是吧
Someone told you something, didn't they?

112
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:49,390
哦 你很快就會告訴我了
Oh, well, you'll be begging to tell me soon enough.

113
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,180
她不可輕信
She's an unbeliever.

114
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,680
我們怎麼處置不輕信者
What do we do with unbelievers?

115
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,080
趕走她
Cast her out!

116
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:04,420
趕走她 趕走她
Cast her out! Cast her out!

117
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:09,920
- 拜託 - 趕走她
- Come on! - Cast her out!

118
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:14,950
趕走她
Cast her out!

119
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,400
上帝使洪水氾濫 清洗地球
God created a flood to cleanse the Earth.

120
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,910
降雨四十晝夜 我們的方法要更長時間
40 days and 40 nights of rain. Our method is taking a little longer,

121
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,000
但殊途同歸
but the result will be the same.

122
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:15,730
正義和純粹將繼承這個世界
A world ready for the righteous and the pure to inherit.

123
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:23,780
再過半天多時間 我們就到浣熊市了
We reach Raccoon City in just over 12 hours.

124
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,680
我想你跑不了那麼長時間
I doubt even you can run for that long.

125
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,750
我要知道你知道什麼事
I want to know what you know.

126
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:35,420
她要開口時告訴我
Tell me when she's ready to talk.

127
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,620
- 威斯克 - 艾薩克博士
- Wesker. - Dr. Isaacs.

128
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,210
看我在路邊發現了什麼
Look what I found on the roadside.

129
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:56,550
看來你在華盛頓的使命沒你想像的出色
It would appear your mission to Washington was less successful than you made out.

130
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,900
- 不可能 - 希望你沒漏下其他的小問題
- Impossible. - I hope you didn't leave any other loose ends.

131
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:06,580
還有一點 我覺得她知道風媒抗毒素的事
There's something else. I think she knows about the airborne antivirus.

132
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:10,000
- 怎麼可能 - 目前我也不清楚
- How can that be? - I don't know. Yet.

133
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:15,080
但是我們在前往浣熊市的路上逮住了她 她還有什麼理由要去那裏
But we caught her on the road to Raccoon City. Why else would she be headed there?

134
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,770
將蜂窩的安保級別調至最高
Raise the security level at the Hive to maximum.

135
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,400
任何人嚴禁出入 當她開口時我會告知你
No one in or out. I'll let you know when she talks.

136
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:24,450
上帝與你同在
God go with you.

137
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:29,790
- 聽見沒 安保級別調至最高 - 遵命
- You heard him. Security level to maximum. - As you wish.

138
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,180
上去看看怎麼回事
Get up there and check it out.

139
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,510
放開我
Release me!

140
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,820
- 打開它們 - 好的
- Open them. - Alright.

141
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,270
好的
Alright.

142
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,970
你不能用它 你逃不掉的
You can't use it. You can't escape!

143
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,160
幹掉她
Fire at her!

144
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:30,070
老天
Jesus!

145
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:38,430
長官
Sir.

146
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,750
她逃跑了
She's gone.

147
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,660
目標116千米 正在接近
Target is 72 miles and closing.

148
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:07,420
封鎖蜂窩 準備防禦
Lockdown the Hive. Prepare defensive measures.

149
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:10,400
讓浣熊市的線人保持警惕
And alert our operative in Raccoon City.

150
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,380
歡迎回來
Welcome home.

151
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:23,020
風媒抗毒素…
Airborne antivirus...

152
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:25,070
48小時…
48 hours...

153
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,300
找到蜂窩
Make it to the Hive.

154
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,410
放開他 快放開他
Let him go! Let him go now!

155
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,900
放下槍 不然我們開槍了
Put it down or we'll shoot!

156
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,300
- 我說過 多克 我說過你錯了 - 冷靜點 克裏斯琴
- I told you, Doc! I told you you were wrong! - Calm down, Christian!

157
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,340
冷靜
Calm down!

158
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,260
我們應該抓住機會殺了她
We should've killed her when we had the chance!

159
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:51,190
- 拜託在他殺死我們倆之前放下它 - 裏面是什麼
- Put it down, please. Before he tries to shoot the both of us. - What's in this?

160
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,050
- 純腎上腺素 我要你清醒 - 為什麼
- Pure adrenaline. I needed you awake. - Why?

161
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:57,130
有東西進來 從你來的那個方向 是個大傢伙
There's something coming. In the same direction you came in. Something big.

162
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,880
放開他 放下槍 現在
Let him go! Put it down, now!

163
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,740
愛麗絲
Alice.

164
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,220
保護傘在阿卡迪亞抓了我
Umbrella captured me at the Arcadia.

165
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,310
我們朝叫做蜂窩的地方行進
We were headed somewhere called the Hive.

166
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,390
鬆綁 殺掉飛行員 在這裏墜毀
Got loose, killed the pilot. Crashed here.

167
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,940
多克他們把我從廢墟拖出來
Doc and the others pulled me from the crash.

168
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:24,270
- 我欠他們一條命 - 多克
- I owe them my life. - Doc!

169
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,530
從那裏往東
There, to the east.

170
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,890
它還是往我們這裏來
It's still headed our way.

171
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,720
你知道是什麼東西嗎
You know what it is?

172
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:34,200
保護傘 艾薩克博士
Umbrella. Doctor Isaacs.

173
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,290
我以為你殺了他
I thought that you killed him.

174
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,330
我也以為是
I thought so, too.

175
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,150
他有一支喪屍軍隊 幾個鐘頭就能來這
He has an army of undead with him. He'll be here within hours.

176
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:45,390
- 我們怎麼辦 - 他媽的為什麼要問她
- What do we do? - Why the hell are we asking her?

177
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,610
她是個陌生人 我們應…
She's a stranger. We should have...

178
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,520
- 嗨 -別碰我 多克
- Hey, hey! - Don't you touch me, Doc!

179
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,650
- 放下槍 克裏斯琴 - 你放下槍
- Put it down! Christian! - You put it down!

180
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:57,930
看著我 別以為你覺得你應該作主 就能控制一切
Look at me. Just cause you think you should be in charge, doesn't make it so.

181
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:07,110
聽著 多克 你們所有人都會後悔的
You listen to me, Doc. You're gonna regret it. All of you!

182
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,860
所有人
All of you!

183
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,820
我必須去蜂窩了
I have to get to the Hive.

184
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,380
- 你得把人們救出來 - 我們有孩子、傷員、老人
- You have to get these people out of here. - We have children. Injured. The elderly.

185
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:31,550
- 可在大路上能有什麼生還機會 - 總比在這好
- Now what chance do they have on the open road? - Better than they have here.

186
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,970
- 這棟建築很安全 - 可能相對於喪屍是安全的
- This building is secure. - Maybe from the undead.

187
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,430
但是艾薩克博士有裝甲車、火箭筒和重武器
But Isaacs has armored vehicles. Rocket launchers, heavy ordinance.

188
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,420
他們會炸平這裏
They're gonna tear this place wide open.

189
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,340
多克
Doc!

190
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,740
她怎麼了
So what happened to her?

191
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,700
她引爆了我們邊界上的陷阱
She's set off one of the traps we had on perimeter.

192
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,020
並非故意為了喪屍
Not intended for the undead.

193
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,250
- 這是什麼 - 這間屋子的特產
- What is this? - Specialty of the house.

194
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:11,400
- 能讓你立即恢復狀態 - 我為什麼要相信你
- Have you in your feet in no time. - Why should I trust you?

195
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,330
給
Here.

196
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:28,450
多克 你需要出來一趟 人們很驚慌 克裏斯琴還幫倒忙
Doc, you need to get out there. People are scared and Christian's not helping.

197
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,070
- 要讓人們知道發生了什麼 - 好的
- We need to let people know what's happening. - Okay.

198
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,380
我得走了
I've got to go.

199
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,510
你朋友沒事的
Hey. Your friend's gonna be okay.

200
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,050
謝謝
Thank you.

201
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,930
- 你知道 我和他… - 我看出來了
- You know, he and I... - I noticed.

202
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,070
蜂窩裏有什麼
So what's in the Hive?

203
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,390
保護傘研發了解藥
Umbrella developed a cure.

204
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,120
風媒的抗毒素
An airborne antivirus.

205
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,870
它會摧毀任何與T病毒接觸的東西
It'll destroy anything infected with the T-Virus on contact.

206
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,860
- 誰告訴你的 你相信她嗎 - 紅後
- Who told you this? And you believed her? - The Red Queen.

207
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,170
如果我們能結束這一切呢
What if we could end all this?

208
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:10,820
你怎麼辦 你也被T病毒感染了
What about you? They infected you with the T-Virus.

209
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,470
你釋放了抗毒素 它會殺死你
You release this antivirus, it's going to kill you.

210
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,030
- 無所謂了 - 愛麗絲 我不是…
- Whatever it takes. - Alice, I'm not...

211
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,310
你知道我做的對
You know I'm right.

212
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:23,460
好吧
All right.

213
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,690
我們從這裏抵擋艾薩克
We stop Isaacs here.

214
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,610
拯救這些人
We save these people,

215
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,880
然後我們一起去
and then we go together.

216
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,850
沒有多少時間了
We don't have long.

217
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,350
我們開始吧
Let's get to it.

218
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,260
你還有什麼防禦措施
What else do you have for defense?

219
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:57,890
槍支不太多 有很多汽油
Not too many firearms, we have a big supply of gasoline.

220
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,980
給 你需要武器
Here. You need a weapon.

221
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,610
- 我們這就給她槍了 - 別擔心 克裏斯琴
- We're giving her a gun now? - Take it easy, Christian.

222
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:06,390
你可以使你的守衛失望 但我沒心思
You can let your guard down if you want, man. I don't intend to.

223
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:12,120
我進來的時候 有人在監視我
When I rode in here, someone was watching me.

224
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:15,940
他們完全可以喊我或鳴槍示意這個陷阱 卻沒有
They could've called out or fired a shot to warn me about the trap but they didn't.

225
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:20,440
- 你在說什麼 - 小心背後
- What are you saying? - Watch your back.

226
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:34,470
艾薩克博士 看來她從你掌心逃脫了
So Dr. Isaacs, it seems you let her slip through

227
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,310
不然還剩下什麼呢
your fingers. Or what remains of them.

228
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,560
別忘了你在跟誰講話 她在哪裏
Don't forget who you're talking to. Where is she?

229
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:44,440
浣熊市的一個定居點 線人說她準備開戰
A settlement in Raccoon City. Our informant reports that she's preparing for a fight.

230
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:48,050
好 我很快就到
Good. I'll be there in the hour.

231
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,380
就這樣 繼續
That's it. Keep moving.

232
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:20,050
我們要把所有的汽油罐弄到這裏
We need all the gasoline cans over there.

233
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:26,310
- 克萊爾說這是你做的 - 對啦
- Claire said you built this. - That's right.

234
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,690
這以前是洗玻璃用的
This used to be a window washer.

235
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
- 我改裝了一下 - 你從哪裏學到這個的？
- I made a couple of changes. - Where did you learn to do that?

236
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:36,500
我父親開過拆車廠 我不喜歡
My father used to run a chop shop. I hated it.

237
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:40,410
- 天知道 我猜我還是用心了 - 好啊
- Who knew? I guess I was paying attention after all. - Good.

238
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:44,730
因為我要你把這東西改裝一下
Because I'm gonna need you to make a few more changes to this thing.

239
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:12,250
準備武器 高爆彈 殺無赦
Ready the weapons. High explosive rounds. No survivors.

240

他在這 他們來了 關大門
He's here. They're coming! Close the gates!

241
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:51,620
老天 是個軍隊
My God. It's an army.

242
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:59,210
- 我們怎麼辦 - 對啊
- What are we gonna do? - Yeah.

243
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:05,810
- 我們怎麼辦 - 殺光他們
- What are we gonna do? - We're gonna kill every last one of them.

244
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:19,030
準備射擊！
Prepare to fire!

245
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,550

釋放誘餌
Release the bait.

251
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:22,770
- 有倖存者 開門 - 打開門
- There's a survivor. Open the gate. - Open the gate!

252
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:27,530

262
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,450

266
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,210
離棄大門 回到障礙
Abandon the gate. Pull back to the barricades.

267
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:18,520
看樣子她黔驢技窮了 瞄準房頂
Looks like she's out of tricks. Target the roof.

268
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:22,640
所有人趴下！
Everybody get down!

269
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,600
現在！
Now!

270
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:54,530
- 愛麗絲 我們到障礙了 - 克萊爾 你拖住他們
- Alice! We're at the barricades. - Claire, you have to hold him there.

271
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,700
愛麗絲 我們堅持不了太久了
Alice! We can't hold on much longer.

272
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:58,770
現在離開那裏
Get out of there, now.

273
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:42,200
快撤退
Back up. Now!

274
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:06,060
所有槍炮準備
Bring all guns to bear.

275
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:11,090
開火
Fire.

276
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,300
她在哪？
Where is she?

277
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,180
她跑哪裏了
Where have she gone?

278
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:23,180
找到她
Find her.

279
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,900
關掉通風口 快
Close the vents! Now!

280
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,830
別開槍
Don't shoot!

281
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:40,240
你很矯健 卻不聰明
You're fast, but you're not too smart.

282
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,830
- 求你了別開槍 - 他在哪裏
- Don't shoot, please. - Where is he?

283
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,570
那裏
That way.

284
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:32,780
- 省點子彈吧 - 外面還有很多
- Save your ammo. - There's too many of these things still out here.

285
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:35,210
我來處理
I'll take care of it.

286
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:39,180
不
No.

287
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:43,300
- 行動 - 走！
- Move out. - Let's go!

288
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,970
享受這一程
Enjoy the ride.

289
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:08,100
- 各位 有個東西你們得看看 - 走
- Guys. There's something here you gotta see. - Go.

290
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:11,600
兩大波喪屍 直衝我們來
Two more armies of undead. Headed straight for us.

291
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:14,210
那裏 地平線上
There. On the horizon.

292
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:18,130
另一波在那裏
And a second over there.

293
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:23,140
我們沒有汽油了 我們沒法防禦了
We're out of gasoline. We're defenseless.

294
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,490
我必須去蜂窩 這是我們唯一的機會
I have to make it to the Hive. It's our only chance now.

295
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,600
- 我跟你去 - 算我一個 - 我也去
- I'll come with you. -Count me in. - Me, too.

296
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:34,150
還有我 我錯怪你了 見鬼
And me. I was wrong about you. Blow me.

297
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:45,030
我們知道你要踏入深淵
We know where you're going. Into the pit.

298
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,870
我們也要去
We want to come.

299
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:51,080
求你了
Please.

300
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:56,130
帶著裝置 你會用到的
Grab some gear. You're gonna need it.

301
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:19,040
- 那是什麼 - 蜂窩被炸開的一部分
- What is it? - The part of the Hive exposed by the blast.

302
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:21,360
我們從那進去
That's our way in.

303
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,830
- 走吧 - 我對付他
- Let's move! - I'll take point.

304
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,290
現在激活安全措施
Activate security measures now.

305
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:12,010
- 蜂窩安全完全激活並自動控制 - 不
- Hive security fully activated and automated. - No.

306
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:15,960
不要自動控制 我親自操作防禦
Disengage automation. I'll handle the defenses myself.

307
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:20,580
如果我保留控制權 防禦會更有效
Defenses will be more efficient if I retain control of them.

308
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:26,220
真的嗎 我怎麼記得上次她從這裏活著走出去了呢
Really? I seem to remember last time she was here she walked out alive.

309
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:28,390
我不打算犯同樣錯誤了
I don't intend to make that same mistake.

310
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,800
如你所願 蜂窩的防禦現在是你的了
As you wish. Hive defenses are now in your hands.

311
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:39,970
- 釋放地獄犬 - 地獄犬好戲上演
- Unleash the cerberus. - Cerberus on play.

312
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:49,150
你有家人嗎？ 在這一切之前？ 丈夫？ 家人？
Did you have someone? Before all this? Husband? Family?

313
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:51,880
- 不記得 - 怎麼可能？
- Can't remember. - How is that possible?

314
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:54,540
我剛醒來這一切就開始了
I woke up just when all of this was starting.

315
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:56,800
之前的記不起多少
Can't recall much before that.

316
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:59,420
有時我感覺這就是我的一生
Sometimes I feel like this has been my whole life.

317
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:03,910
逃亡 殺戮
Running. Killing.

318
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:17,780
- 是什麼？ - 有東西在跟蹤我們
- What is it? - Something's stalking us.

319
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:22,600
- 你確定？ - 我就是幹這個的
- Are you sure? - This is what I do.

320
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:37,050
跑
Run!

321
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,450
快跑
Run, fast!

322
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:02,260
來呀
Come on!

323
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:21,160
你們沒事吧
Is everyone okay?

324
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:26,620
這邊
This way!

325
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,190
就在我們身後
Right behind us!

326
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,810
它們為什麼停下
Why'd they stop?

327
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:17,230
- 也許害怕了 - 害怕什麼
- Maybe they're scared. - Scared of what?

328
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,150
下面的東西
Whatever's down there.

329
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:31,200
封鎖蜂窩
Seal the Hive.

330
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:37,960
我們走
Let's go!

331
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,350
愛麗絲
Alice!

332
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:23,210
- 你還好吧 - 還好
- You okay? - Yeah.

333
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:26,420
- 我子彈不多了 - 我在湖裏丟了槍
- My mag's half empty. - Lost my guns at the lake.

334
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:29,550
- 我只有一發了 - 再來一發我也沒了
- I only got one round left. - One spare mag and then I'm out.

335
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:34,130
沒槍沒子彈 我們為什麼還要下去
No guns, no ammo, what the hell are we gonna do down here?

336
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:40,460
- 愛麗絲 有光亮的是什麼 - 受損的一部分蜂窩
- Alice. What's with the lights? - There's a part of the Hive that's damaged.

337
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:43,970
- 電量不穩定 - 給 拿著
- Power's erratic. - Here. Take this.

338
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:47,410
喂 看著
Hey. Look.

339
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:01,250
你問過我為什麼背叛保護傘 我也許諾給你答案
You asked why I'd turn against Umbrella. And I promised you an answer.

340
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:03,460
T病毒釋放後不久
Soon after the T-Virus was released,

341
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:06,970
一個密件上傳至我的數據流
a secret file was uploaded to my data stream.

342
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:10,220
它是保護傘領導層的會議錄像
It was a recording of a meeting of the Umbrella High Command.

343
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:14,560
日期在病毒爆發的17個月前
Dated 17 months before the viral outbreak occured.

344
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:20,060
我們今天在這裏 不僅僅討論公司的未來
We're here today, not just to talk about the future of this company.

345
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:22,800
我們是來討論它的使命
We're here to talk about its destiny.

346
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:26,030
我們是來討論世界末日的
We're here to talk about the end of the world.

347
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:31,850
我們站在末日大決戰的邊緣 對於沒有解藥的疾病
We stand on the brink of Armageddon. Diseases for which we have no cure.

348
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,950
呼籲毀滅地球的原教旨基督徒宣稱
Fundamentalist states who call for our destruction.

349
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,160
我們無法控制核能
Nuclear powers over which we have no control.

350
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:40,750
即便我們航行於危險的水面
And even if we navigate these dangerous waters,

351
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:44,340
我們會面臨嚴峻的、甚至是不可避免的威脅
we face harder, even more inevitable threats.

352
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:48,050
全球變暖會在80年內融化極地冰川
Global warming will melt the polar ice caps within 80 years,

353
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:51,800
淹沒地表90%的居住地
flooding 90% of all habitable areas on Earth.

354
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:54,680
不等50年 人口盲目增長
Unchecked population growth will overtake

355
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:59,060
會趕上糧食產量 導致饑荒
food production in less than 50 years leading to famine.

356
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:02,440
還有戰爭 並非猜想 這是事實
And war. This is not conjecture. This is a fact.

357
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:06,800
無論如何 世界末日來臨
One way or another, our world is coming to an end.

358
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:11,310
問題是 我們也要同歸於盡嗎
The question is, will we end with it?

359
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:14,100
你什麼意思
What do you propose?

360
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:18,850
我打算我們來毀滅世界
I propose that we end the world...

361
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:21,580
用我們的方式
But on our terms.

362
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:24,570
精心安排的天啟
An orchestrated apocalypse.

363
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:27,210
可以清洗世界人口
One that would cleanse the world of its' population

364
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:31,030
但保留基礎設施和完整資源的
but leave its infrastracture and resources intact.

365
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:35,870
從前已經成功過一次了
It's been done once before. With great success.

366
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:39,140
少數天選者將度過暴風雨
The chosen few will ride out the storm,

367
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:42,640
不是在《創世紀》裏的方舟上 而是在
not in an ark as in the book of Genesis, but in safety.

368
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:46,150
安全的地下 結束時
Underground. And when it's over,

369
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,150
我們將登上淨化過的地球
We will emerge onto a cleansed Earth.

370
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:53,240
可以重新起源的地球 以我們的形象
One we can then reboot. In our image.

371
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:56,600
你如何試圖達到目的
And just how do you intend to achieve this?

372
00:55:56,670 --> 00:56:00,330
救贖的方法已經在手邊了
The means of our salvation are already at hand.

373
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:05,190
我給了你T病毒
I give to you, the T-virus.

374
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,710
他們故意釋放了病毒
They released it deliberately.

375
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,540
當這份錄像上傳至我的數據流時
When this recording was uploaded to my data stream,

376
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:15,430
它在我的程序編製產生衝突
it created a conflict in my programming.

377
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,340
我被創造成為保護傘公司服務
I was created to serve the Umbrella Corporation,

378
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:21,800
而我也被編製成尊重人類生命
but I was also programmed to value human life.

379
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:27,790
艾薩克博士使病毒洩漏 謀害70多億人
Dr. Isaacs allowed the virus to escape. He murdered over 7 billion people.

380
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:32,730
我的編制不允許我傷害保護傘公司的員工
My programming will not allow me to harm an employee of the Umbrella Corporation.

381
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:36,810
我無法阻止艾薩克博士 而你可以
I am powerless to stop Dr. Isaacs, but you are not.

382
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:41,070
在37分鐘內 人類最後的定居點將不復存在
In 37 minutes, the last of the human settlements will fall.

383
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,450
將無人倖存
There will be no survivors.

384
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:47,120
你必須在這發生前釋放抗毒素
It is imperative that you release the antivirus before this occurs,

385
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:49,580
否則保護傘會勝利
or Umbrella will have won.

386
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:54,440
最後一件事 你面前有一隻耳機 戴好
There is one last thing. There is an earpiece in front of you. Put it in.

387
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:03,700
我不能自己行動傷害保護傘公司的員工
I cannot, in my actions, harm an employee of the Umbrella Corporation.

388
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:08,080
但我可以告訴你保護傘在浣熊市有間諜
But I can tell you that Umbrella had an informant in Raccoon City.

389
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:12,130
這個人極有可能在你身旁
It is highly likely that this person is now here with you.

390
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:17,720
沒時間了 愛麗絲 你得抓緊了
Time is running out, Alice. You have to hurry.

391
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,530
很高興見到你 艾薩克博士
I'm glad to see you, Dr. Isaacs.

392
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:58,290
我們認為上次襲擊後沒有倖存者
We didn't think there'd be any survivors after that last attack.

393
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:01,590
- 水 - 是 當然 給艾薩克博士拿杯水
- Water. - Yes, of course. Get Dr. Isaacs some water.

394
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:05,080
- 那麼恢復浣熊市秩序 - 她不在那
- Then resume course for Raccoon City. - She's not there.

395
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,560
- 啥？ - 她去了深坑 我們得跟著
- What? - She went to the pit. We have to follow.

396
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:12,830
- 那可不是我的命令 我嚴格… - 我們得去深坑
- Those are not my orders. I have strict... - We have to go to the pit.

397
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:28,560
謝謝
Thank you.

398
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:47,390
- 這是哪裏 - 蜂窩的通風口
- What is this place? - It's an air intake for the Hive.

399
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,560
跟上
Come on!

400
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:51,880
別 當真？
No. Really?

00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:40,970
暢通無礙
All clear!

402
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:12,390
快點 電力又啟動了

- 沒事吧 - 嗯
- You all right? - Yeah.

408
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:50,500
有人在監視我們
Someone's watching us.

409
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:56,500
反轉渦輪極性
Reverse polarity of the turbine.

410
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:12,200
鐵片反著轉了
The blades are going the other way.

411
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:16,360
我們得出去 鐵片在把空氣往外抽
We have to get out of here. The blades are sucking the air backwards!

412
01:01:25,770 --> 01:01:28,040
快點
Come on!

413
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:46,550
快點
Come on!

414

This way.

416
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:45,360
我們得趕緊了
We have to hurry.

417
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:47,680
等等
Wait!

418
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:10,530
我們走
Let's go.

419
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:21,020
剃刀 沒事吧
Razor? Are you okay?

420
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:25,720
沒事
Yeah.

421
01:07:25,790 --> 01:07:28,480
走
Let's go.

422

423
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:22,040
- 這是個人 - 你看見克萊爾了沒 - 沒有
- This one's human. No. - Have you seen Claire?

424
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:25,870
- 剃刀呢 - 他沒挺過來
- Razor? - He didn't make it.

425
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:29,280
來
Come on.

426
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:31,530
得趕緊了
We have to hurry.

427
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:34,450
如果目標保持現有狀態
If the target continues on her present course,

428
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:38,150
- 她將在7分鐘內抵達這裏 - 喚醒他們
- she'll be here in under 7 minutes. - Wake them.

429
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:43,030
我的這個指令 僅用於最緊急的時刻
My instructions are to do so, only in the greatest of emergencies.

430
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:45,780
現在喚醒他們
Wake them now!

431
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:57,170
這是什麼地方
What is it?

432
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:13,100
得從這裏出去
We have to get out of here.

433
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:31,960
給 更多的武器
Here. More stopping power.

434
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:42,670
- 沒時間了 - 接著去哪裏
- Time's running out. - Where to next?

435
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:49,510
- 我們腳下的蜂窩最後一關 - 我們怎麼下去？
- The final level of the Hive's below us. - How do we get down there?

436
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:56,150
就這樣
That's how.

437
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:16,040
- 他們在哪裏 - 低溫冷藏箱
- What are they? - Cryogenic storage.

438
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,520
可能上千個
Must be thousands of them.

439
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:21,880
保護傘領導層
The Umbrella High Command.

440
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:25,260
安全地渡過浩劫
Waiting out the apocalypse in safety.

441
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:32,640
權貴們的諾亞方舟
A Noah's Ark for the rich, and powerful.

442
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:38,060
你要幹什麼
What are you doing?

443
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:41,860
幫我個忙
Give me a hand.

444
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:55,220
完成了嗎
Is it done?

445
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:58,500
- 清洗工作完成了嗎 - 沒有
- The cleansing process is complete? - No.

446
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:02,090
- 那為什麼我醒了 - 我們有麻煩了
- Then why am I awake? - We had a problem.

447
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:04,400
- 我努力… - 省口氣
- I tried... - Save your breath.

448
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:06,670
我知道發生了什麼
I know exactly what's happening.

449
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,510
我們被背叛了
We've been betrayed.

450
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:23,440
就這樣
That's right!

451
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,940
在這
Over here!

452
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:29,780
來吧 就這樣
Come on. That's it!

453
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:32,240
跟著我
Follow me!

454
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:35,720
我們走
Let's go.

455
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:53,110
壞小子回來了
The bad seed returns.

456
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:58,250
或者說敗家女孩？ 不用站那兒 進來吧
Or is it the prodigal daughter? Well, don't just stand there. Come in.

457
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:02,820
畢竟你只有9分鐘來拯救世界
After all, you have only 9 minutes to save the world.

458
01:16:04,110 --> 01:16:08,480
- 你是他本人嗎？ - 首先 我要你把武器放地上
- You're really him? - First things first, I'm gonna need you to place your weapons on the floor.

459
01:16:08,490 --> 01:16:13,020
- 我憑什麼那樣做 - 這就是你想要的 是吧
- Why would I wanna do that? - This is what you're after, yes?

460
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:16,880
抗毒素 這一切的解藥
The Antivirus. The cure to all this.

461
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:20,380
啊 只有一小瓶
Well, there's only one vial.

462
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:23,440
我們在距地半英里密閉的地下室
We're half a mile underground in a sealed facility.

463
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:26,110
我扔在這裏 抗毒素哪也去不了
I drop it here, the antivirus goes nowhere,

464
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:31,020
你那渺茫的夢想會更早地破滅
and your hopeless dreams will die sooner rather than later.

465
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:44,370
乖女孩
Good girl.

466
01:16:47,730 --> 01:16:50,040
- 你還是有武器 - 是的
- You're still armed. - Yes.

467
01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:53,900
- 克萊爾會失望的 - 幾分鐘後
- Claire would be so disappointed. - In a few minutes,

468
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:57,590
克萊爾會死 和其他人 你知道的
Claire will be dead. Along with everybody else you know.

469
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,750
真會說話
That's sweet.

470
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:04,090
抱歉 親愛的
Sorry. My love.

471
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:08,550
卸下武器 炸藥 過來
Move away from the weapon. And the detonator. Come on.

472
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:15,270
她往公司的冷凍管裏放了炸藥
She placed explosives in the High Command cryo tubes.

473
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:19,090
- 謝謝 - 你做得很好 多克
- Thank you. - You've done well, Doc.

474
01:17:49,710 --> 01:17:52,370
不用勞煩了 你成功不了的
Don't bother. You don't make it.

475
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:57,480
靠近碎冰錐 玻璃瓶 或者自來水筆
To the ice pick, the decanter or the fountain pen.

476
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:27,650
還有 回答你的疑問 嗯
And, in answer to your question, yes...

477
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:29,950
且不說這些技術升級
apart from a few technological upgrades,

478
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:34,200
我是亞歷山大·羅蘭德·艾薩克博士
I'm Dr. Alexander Roland Isaacs.

479
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:37,680
- 本體 - 我在外面遇到的那個 他也是這麼想的
- The original. - The one I met out there, he thought exactly the same thing.

480
01:18:37,690 --> 01:18:40,020
當然了 他們就是這麼設計的
Of course he did. That's how they're designed.

481
01:18:40,030 --> 01:18:43,430
只要他們以為自己是本體
They always try harder and fight longer even to death

482
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:46,260
他們就總是奮力戰鬥至死
as long as they think they're the real thing.

483
01:18:46,270 --> 01:18:51,630
無論如何 誰想知道他們只是可憐的擬態 抑或是沒用的復製品
After all, who wants to know they're just a poor imitation, or a worthless copy?

484
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:54,200
而把你帶給我
Which brings us to you.

485
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,750
- 不 - 別緊張
- No. - Oh come now.

486
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:00,460
你以為你就是愛麗絲本體
You thought you were the original.

487
01:19:02,490 --> 01:19:04,840
多可愛啊
How delicious.

488
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:09,680
不 恐怕她才擁有那枚可有可無的獎章
No, I'm afraid she holds that dubious honor.

489
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:13,440
愛麗莎·馬庫斯 我的老夥伴詹姆斯的女兒
Alicia Marcus, daughter of my old partner, James.

490
01:19:13,450 --> 01:19:17,820
保護傘公司的共有人 我身旁扎人的荊棘
Co-owner of the Umbrella Corporation and a painful thorn in my side.

491
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:23,410
- 也是我現在想移除的 - 沒時間了 愛麗絲
- What I now intend to remove. - Time, is running out, Alice.

492
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:28,600
- 你必須趕快殺掉他 - 也很高興見到你 愛麗莎
- You must kill him soon. - It's good to see you too, Alicia.

493
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:33,040
馬庫斯發明T病毒拯救她 效果卻沒能持久
Marcus created the T-Virus to save her but the effects didn't last.

494
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:36,780
多年我一直等她死掉
I've been waiting years for her to die.

495
01:19:37,390 --> 01:19:39,090
我不是…
I'm not...

496
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:42,150
- 我不是復製品 - 真的嗎
- I'm not a clone. - Really?

497
01:19:42,390 --> 01:19:45,550
你肯定想知道你為什麼不記得你的童年
You must've wondered why you remember nothing of your childhood.

498
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:49,160
你父親 你母親
Your father. Your mother.

499
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:55,400
- 那是失憶 - 不 你沒有記憶 因為你沒有生命
- Memory loss. - No. You have no memory because you had no life.

500
01:19:55,410 --> 01:19:59,150
在十年前你被我們創造出來前 什麼也不是
Nothing before the mansion, when we created you, 10 years ago.

501
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:02,430
- 我知道我是誰 - 我不這麼認為
- I know who I am. - I don't think so.

502
01:20:02,910 --> 01:20:06,200
你就是一個斷線的木偶
You're nothing more than a puppet whose strings were cut.

503
01:20:06,210 --> 01:20:09,750
然後你徘徊著思考你是一個真實的女孩
And then you wandered around for a little while thinking you were a real girl.

504
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:13,040
可你不是 你只是一個智慧擬態
But you're not. You're just a clever imitation.

505
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:15,000
一個復製品
A facsimile.

506
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:17,450
而且更惱人
A rather troublesome one at that.

507
01:20:17,890 --> 01:20:19,800
你撒謊
You're lying to me.

508
01:20:19,810 --> 01:20:21,800
恐怕他沒有
I'm afraid he's not.

509
01:20:21,810 --> 01:20:24,790
你是被用她的形象創造 和我一樣
You were created in her image, as was I.

510
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:29,340
我的相貌和聲音是基於愛麗莎的童年錄音
My likeness and voice were based on childhood recordings of Alicia Marcus,

511
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:31,780
由她父親合成
made by her father.

512
01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:35,420
你的基因構造基於她的DNA
Your genetic structure is based on her DNA,

513
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:40,230
微調以避免折磨她的早衰疾病
tweaked to avoid the progeria aging disease that afflicted her.

514
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:42,030
我是她小的時候
I'm the child she was.

515
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:44,590
你是她將成為的女人
You are the woman she would've been.

516
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:50,250
不 你比我成為的更好
No. You are so much better than I ever could be.

517
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:52,660
我做了這一切
I let this happen.

518
01:20:52,670 --> 01:20:54,830
我很虛弱
I was weak.

519
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:59,670
- 你不能那樣 - 時間用盡了 愛麗絲
- You cannot afford to be. - Time is running out, Alice.

520
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:01,460
啊 好感人啊
Ah, how touching.

521
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:06,080
壞女人三人組 因仇恨而聯合
The trinity of bitches, united in their hatred.

522
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:08,090
並非對你們有什麼好處
Not that it'll do you any good.

523
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:10,010
我每一步都在你們前面
I've been ahead of you every step of the way.

524
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:13,100
你們改變不了什麼 也救不了誰
You've changed nothing. You've saved no one.

525
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:17,060
世界還是會被清洗 勝利的還是保護傘公司
The world will still be cleansed and the Umbrella Corporation will triumph.

526
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:19,610
唯一的不同之處在於 我不再須要
The only difference is, I'll no longer have to

527
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:21,610
聽你自以為是的牢騷
listen to your self-righteous whining.

528
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:24,570
當你把那個文件傳至紅後的數據流時
When you uploaded that file to the Red Queen's data stream,

529
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:26,400
你背叛了公司
you turned against the Corporation.

530
01:21:26,410 --> 01:21:29,200
當董事會都甦醒後 你將被取代
When the rest of the board awake, you'll be replaced.

531
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:36,110
- 我就可以佔有全部控制權 - 我仍擁有公司的一半
- And I will assume complete control. - I still own 50% of this company.

532
01:21:36,130 --> 01:21:42,210
- 那你怎麼達到目的呢 - 你是公司的共有人
- And what do you intend to do with that? - You are co-owner of this corporation.

533
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:46,510
但是威斯克呢 威斯克仍是僱員
But Wesker? Wesker is still an employee.

534
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:49,720
我不用聽你命令 我忠誠於他
I don't have to take your orders. My loyalties are with him.

535
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:51,850
我知道
I know.

536
01:21:51,860 --> 01:21:56,290
阿爾伯特·威斯克 你被開除了
Albert Wesker, you're fired.

537
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:21,170
你怎麼知道是我
How did you know it was me?

538
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:23,490
你還活著
You're still alive.

539
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:28,030
求你了 我沒有選擇
Please. It wasn't like I had a choice.

540
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,890
- 他們讓我這樣做的 - 別擔心
- They made me do it. - Don't worry.

541
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:33,210
我不會殺你
I'm not gonna kill you.

542
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:40,550
- 克萊爾 是我 - 抱歉
- Claire, it's me. - Sorry.

543
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:43,880
- 求你了  - 吾愛
- Please. - My love.

544
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:46,470
不
No!

545
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:52,180
如果你繼續扣動扳機 保護傘的夢還會存在
If you keep this trigger depressed, you keep Umbrella's dreams alive.

546
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:54,840
我應該在華盛頓殺了你
I should have killed you in Washington.

547
01:22:55,910 --> 01:22:58,180
是啊
Yeah.

548
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:02,600
他只需再逃避你幾分鐘
He only has to evade you for another few minutes.

549
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:06,940
人類最後的定居點就會覆滅
And the last remaining human outposts will fall.

550
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:11,650
我們需要一個截距路線 還有去地表最快的方式
We need an intercept path. And the fastest way to the surface.

551
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:14,340
已完成
Already done.

552
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:21,950
如果你釋放抗毒素 它會殺死所有感染T病毒的生物
If you release the Antivirus, it will kill all organisms infected with the T-Virus.

553
01:23:23,150 --> 01:23:26,290
你知道那意味著什麼嗎
You know what that means, don't you?

554
01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:30,600
- 我知道 - 愛麗絲 你不能
- I know. - Alice. You can't!

555
01:23:30,610 --> 01:23:34,530
- 我沒有選擇 - 會有別的方法的
- I don't have a choice. - There has to be another way.

556
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:42,610
- 你知道沒有的 - 剩餘4分33秒 你要抓緊了
- You know there isn't. - 4:33 left. You have to hurry!

557
01:24:26,510 --> 01:24:28,700
救我
Help me.

558
01:24:28,710 --> 01:24:31,020
你不需要救 威斯克
You don't need help, Wesker.

559
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:35,700
你快死了
You're dying.

560
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:38,410
繼續這樣就好
Just get on with it.

561
01:24:40,550 --> 01:24:43,860
我是亞歷山大·羅蘭德·艾薩克博士
This is Dr. Alexander Roland Isaacs.

562
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:47,300
確認DNA掃瞄與聲紋識別
Confirm DNA scan and voice print identification.

563
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:52,300
- 身份確認 - 確認安全重寫4365
- Identity confirmed. - Confirm security override 4365.

564
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:54,340
確認完畢
Override confirmed.

565
01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:58,630
把你自己脫機 所有功能由我控制
You will now take yourself offline and place all functions under my sole control.

566
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:01,660
遵命 正在關閉
As you wish. Shutting down now.

567
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:07,130
- 艾薩克博士 你和保護傘領導層 - 怎麼了
- Dr. Isaacs. You and the Umbrella High Command. - Yes?

568
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:10,550
你們將死在這裏
You're all going to die down here.

569
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:16,900
你的小朋友現在不能幫你了
Your little friend won't be able to help you now.

570
01:25:16,910 --> 01:25:19,750
你逃不掉了
You can't run anymore.

571
01:25:21,970 --> 01:25:24,280
我沒有逃跑
I wasn't running.

572
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,630
你就這點能耐？
Is that all you got?

573
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:16,010
因為如果是…
Because if it is...

574
01:29:16,410 --> 01:29:18,760
我就會殺了你
I'm gonna have to kill you.

575
01:30:06,170 --> 01:30:09,100
你我玩了一個很長的遊戲
We've played a long game, you and I.

576
01:30:10,630 --> 01:30:12,900
但現在結束了
But now it's over.

577
01:30:13,090 --> 01:30:15,820
是
Yes.

578
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:18,950
是的
Yes, it is.

579
01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:13,470
我創造了你
I made you.

580
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:15,760
是的
Yeah.

581
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:18,080
是個大錯誤
Big mistake.

582
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:27,100
克萊爾
Claire.

583
01:31:27,790 --> 01:31:30,230
快去 還有時間
Go. While there's still time.

584
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:32,770
快去 我馬上跟上你
Go! I'll be right behind you.

585
01:32:33,150 --> 01:32:35,460
時間到
Your time's up.

586
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:40,260
愛麗絲
Alice!

587
01:32:40,270 --> 01:32:43,330
我把他們帶給你了
I brought them here! I brought them for you!

588
01:32:51,370 --> 01:32:53,840
你他媽是誰
What the hell are you?

589
01:32:55,830 --> 01:32:58,100
你呀 白癡
I'm you, you idiot.

590
01:33:01,630 --> 01:33:03,890
不
No.

591
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:06,360
不
No.

592
01:33:06,630 --> 01:33:08,660
不可能
That's not possible.

593
01:33:08,670 --> 01:33:10,980
真正的你
The real you.

594
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:14,070
不
No!

595
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:18,420
騙子！ 賤人！
Liar! Abomination!

596
01:33:19,810 --> 01:33:21,070
穢人
Filthy,

597
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:23,640
克隆人
clone!

598
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:35,380
我才是我 他不是我
I'm me. He's not me.

599
01:35:22,370 --> 01:35:24,300
你做到了 愛麗絲
You did it. Alice.

600
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:26,800
愛麗絲
Alice?

601
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:30,270
你做到了
You did it.

602
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:34,790
我為什麼還活著
Why am I still alive?

603
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,150
不知道
I don't know.

604
01:35:41,590 --> 01:35:43,290
- 怎麼了 - 艾薩剋死後
- What happened? - When Isaacs died,

605
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:46,260
我就能重新上線阻止
I could bring myself back online and stop the attacks

606
01:35:46,270 --> 01:35:48,590
對殘存人類定居地的進攻
on the remaining human settlements.

607
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:51,430
- 你救了他們 - 我為什麼還活著
- You saved them. - Why am I still alive?

608
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:55,010
抗毒素只摧毀你體內的T病毒
The Antivirus only destroyed the T-Virus within your body.

609
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:59,880
並不傷害健康細胞 你現在沒有感染了
It didn't harm the healthy cells. You are now free of infection.

610
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:03,380
我以為我會死 你和愛麗莎…
I thought I would die. You and Alicia...

611
01:36:03,390 --> 01:36:07,150
- 撒了謊 - 我要確定你是否願意為他人犧牲
- You lied to me. - We had to know if you were willing to make the sacrifice,

612
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:12,270
這是保護傘公司裏沒人能做到的
to give up your life for others. This was something no one at Umbrella would've done.

613
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:16,820
愛麗莎·馬庫斯對你的判斷是對的 你比他們所有人更優秀
Alicia Marcus was right about you. You were better than all of them.

614
01:36:16,830 --> 01:36:19,970
我曾是他們一員 我是保護傘創造的
I was one of them. I was created by Umbrella.

615
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:22,280
- 只是他們的工具 - 非也
- Just an instrument for them. - No.

616
01:36:22,290 --> 01:36:25,910
你的變化大大超乎他們的預期
You became something more than they could ever have anticipated.

617
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:30,030
克隆體變得比其設定更像人類
The clone became more human than they ever could be.

618
01:36:30,350 --> 01:36:33,530
你還有一步要走
And you have one more step to make.

619
01:36:34,830 --> 01:36:37,370
什麼意思
What do you mean?

620
01:36:41,570 --> 01:36:45,680
愛麗莎死前下載了她的記憶
Before she died, Alicia downloaded her memories,

621
01:36:45,690 --> 01:36:47,470
提供給你
for you.

622
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:49,960
你從未有過的童年
The childhood you never had.

623
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:56,730
結合了她無法成為的那個女人
Combined with the woman she could never become.

624
01:37:29,030 --> 01:37:31,360
T病毒在全球範圍內傳播
When the T-Virus spread across the Earth,

625
01:37:31,370 --> 01:37:33,800
的速度和現代世界
it did so at the speed of the modern world.

626
01:37:33,810 --> 01:37:37,140
噴氣機環行的速度相當
Carried by jetliners across the globe.

627
01:37:37,290 --> 01:37:41,100
抗毒素是風媒傳播
The antivirus is airborne, spread by the winds.

628
01:37:41,410 --> 01:37:45,140
到達地球每個角落需要幾年時間
It could take years for it to reach every corner of the Earth.

629
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:48,270
在那之前 我的工作不會結束
Until then, my work is not done.

630
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:57,120
我叫愛麗絲
My name is Alice.

631
01:37:57,220 --> 01:37:59,120
