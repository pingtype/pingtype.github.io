如果蘋果落入他們手中

我們的生死無關緊要
Our lives are nothing.

17
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,210
蘋果才是重中之重

18
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,880
雄鷹的靈魂 將守望未來

19
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,190
當其他人盲目的追尋真相和真實的時候
Where other men blindly follow the truth,

20
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,610
記住 萬物皆虛

我們是刺客

118
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,430
交出最后一塊異教徒的避難所

只有圣殿騎士會最終統治西班牙

呆在記憶里 卡爾

128
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,390
回看過去 世界歷史
Looking back it's clear that a history

129
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,730
顯然就是一部暴力史
of the world is history a violence.

130
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,940
去年反社會行為對經濟的影響

00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:49,530
我們認為 人們現今都壓抑著暴力行為
We believe that man today experiences

133
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:54,750
又難以找到合適的宣泄方式
a measure of aggression which he finds no acceptable outlets.

134
00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:01,170
現在想象一下 如果這些損失都能被用到別的地方
Now imagine if all these costs could be channeled elsewhere...

135
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,340
回溯進行的好嗎

And the artifact?

143
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,820
伊甸蘋果已經觸之可及了
The Apple. It's within our grasp.

144
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,160
里面究竟發生了什么 你為什么要拉他
What happened in there? Why did you pull him?

145
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:33,410
我必須這樣做 我們需要保證他的健康與安全
I had to. We have to keep him healthy.

146
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,040
讓他有自信 我相信他不會讓我們失望的
Earn his confidence. And I know he'll lead us to it.

147
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,250
推他下去
Push him.

148
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:42,250
阿尼姆斯不是這么用的
That's not how the Animus works.

149
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,890
好了
Here you go.

150
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,230
謝謝
Thank you.

151
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,810
1917年 盧瑟福分裂了原子

152
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,280
1953年 沃森和克里克發現雙了螺旋結構
1953 Watson and Crick find a double helix.

153
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,070
2016年
2016 my daughter

154
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,950
我的女兒發現了治療暴力的方法
finds the cure for violence.

155
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,130
你總是比我做得更好
You've always been brighter than me.

156
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,510
我要遲到了
I'm late.

157
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,840
我要去向長老們匯報情況
I have to report to the Elders.

158
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:59,660
1492年 弗朗西斯科 里齊的作品 大審判
Francisco Rizi's Grand Inquisition. 1492.

159
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,540
戰爭 宗教迫害
War, religious prosecution,

160
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,000
神父托克馬達或是圣殿騎士中的一個人
and the closest that Father Torquemada or any of our Order

161
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,880
也在此時發現了伊甸蘋果
came to a finding the Apple of Eden.

162
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,470
你好嗎 我的朋友
How are you, my friend?

163
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:11,970
很好
Well.

164
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,930
閣下
Your Excellency.

165
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,300
下周長老院會面之時
Next week when the Elders meet,

166
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:20,430
我們應投票決定是否暫停阿布斯泰戈項目
we shall vote to discontinue your Abstergo project.

167
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,440
我們認為每年授予你的三十億美元
We feel that giving you 3 billion annually,

168
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,730
用在別處是個更好的選擇
could be better spent elsewhere.

169
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,070
三十億完全沒辦法和我的
Three billion is nothing compared to...

170
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,860
我們已經贏了
We've won.

171
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,150
人們已經不再關心他們的公民自由了
People are no longer care about their civil liberties,

172
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,860
他們關心的是生活水平
they care about their standard of life.

173
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,830
現代世界已經容不下自由這種概念了
The modern world has outgrown notions like freedom.

174
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,830
他們愿意跟隨我們
They are content to follow.

175
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,500
威脅仍會停留 自由也會存在
The threat remains while free will exists.

176
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,920
我們已經在宗教 政治和現在的消費主義上
For centuries we try with religion,

177
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,050
投入了幾個世紀的時間
with politics and now consumerism

178
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,880
就為了消除異教思想
to eliminate dissent.

179
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:57,090
難道我們現在不應該給科學讓路了嗎
Isn't it the time we gave a science a try?

180
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,260
我的女兒對此了解的比我們都要深刻
My daughter is closer than we've ever been.

181
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,270
你美麗漂亮的女兒還好嗎
How is your beautiful daughter?

182
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,730
她正在追蹤蘋果的守護者
She has traced protectors of the Apple.

183
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,860
在哪
Where?

184
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,700
后裔呢
The descendents?

185
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,570
幾乎所有的后人都死了
All the blood lines have died out.

186
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,280
但還剩一個
But one.

187
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:25,410
我們在五百年前找到了他 在刺客兄弟會
We've traced his back 500 years, to the Assassin's Brotherhood.

188
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,280
通常錯覺就是我們通常說的出血效應
Hallucinations are what we call the "Bleeding effect."

189
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,160
試想你的回溯
Images of your regression,

190
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,830
可以感受到你現在的視角
laying themselves over your present day field of vision.

191
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,880
如果你允許的話 我可以教你怎樣控制他們
If you allow me, I can teach you how to control them.

192
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,010
退后 我能解決的
Stand down. I have this.

193
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,470
聽她的
Let it be.

194
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,590
那是什么 那個機器
What is it? The machine?

195
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,180
這是基因記憶
It's genetic memory.

196
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,220
通過阿尼姆斯
By using the Animus,

197
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:15,810
可以重現我們祖先的生活
we can relive lives of those who made us who we are.

198
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:32,410
我在那里看到的 感覺很真實
What I saw in there, it felt real.

199
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,910
就是真的
It was.

200
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:37,620
某種程度來說
In a way.

201
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,540
別跟我扯淡
Don't mess with me!

202
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,380
我現在感覺自己不一樣了
I feel different now.

203
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,340
為什么這么激動
Why the aggression?

204
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,300
我性格就這樣
I'm an aggressive person.

205
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,890
這個監獄是干什么的
What kind of prison is this?

206
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,350
這里不是監獄 卡爾
It's not a prison, Cal.

207
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,940
你配合
You'll learn more if you cooperate.

208
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,690
放開我
Let me go.

209
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,240
我餓了
I'm hungry.

210
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,960
跟我來
Come with me.

211
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,320
這是什么
What is this?

212
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,950
我對你了如指掌 卡爾
I know everything about you, Cal.

213
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:56,450
你的醫療記錄 心理檔案
Your medical data, your psychological profile,

214
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,370
以及你的MAO-A基因突變
the mutations in your MAO-A gene.

215
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,790
我知道你寄養家庭的事情
I know about the foster homes.

216
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,550
還有你在少管所的事情
The juvenile homes.

217
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:09,170
你就是遺傳型犯罪活生生的例子
You are a living proof of the link between heredity and crime.

218
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,930
你怎么找到的我
How did you find me?

219
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,970
我們發現了阿圭拉
We found Aguilar.

220
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,720
當你被捕的時候 你的DNA和他的匹配
When you were arrested, your DNA matched his.

221
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,980
- 阿圭拉是誰 - 你的祖先
- Who is Aguilar? - Your ancestor.

222
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,900
他的家族曾經是刺客
His family were Assassins.

223
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,940
他們被圣殿騎士 托爾克馬達
They were burnt at the stake by the Templars,

224
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,900
和你看到的暗黑騎士奧赫達燒死在了火刑柱上
Torquemada and the black knight you saw, Ojeda.

225
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,700
阿圭拉接過了刺客教團的使命
Aguilar took up the Assassins' cause.

226
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,290
你經常出去嗎
Do you go out much?

227
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,500
比你多
More than you.

228
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:48,800
那這里的其他人呢 也都是小白鼠嗎
And the others in here? Are they the lab rats too?

229
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,880
他們是刺客 像他們祖先一樣的殺人犯
They are Assassins, murderers like their ancestors.

230
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,600
像你一樣 卡爾
Like you, Cal.

231
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:58,270
生來就帶有暴力傾向
All born with predisposition to violence.

232
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,860
殺人犯
Murderer?

233
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,990
- 你殺了那個人 - 一個皮條客
- You killed the man. - A pimp.

234
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,990
你還會再殺人嗎
Would you kill again?

235
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,080
幸福的家庭
Happy families.

236
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,090
她一定很為你自豪
She must be very proud.

237
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,750
我無法得知她的想法了
I wouldn't know.

238
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,260
她被一個刺客所殺
She was killed by an Assassin.

239
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,930
就像你母親一樣
Like your mother.

240
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,100
抱歉
Sorry.

241
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,520
我老爸殺了我媽媽
My old man killed my mother.

242
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,360
你對此是什么感覺
And how does that make you feel?

243
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,860
我想殺了他
Like killing him.

244
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:59,120
我們要么讓它影響我們一生
Either we let it to effect us for the rest of our lives,

245
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,370
要么會為之改變
or we just do something about it.

246
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,460
你變得暴力 我投身科學
You turn to violence, I turn to science.

247
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,920
這是伊甸蘋果 卡爾
It's the Apple of Eden, Cal.

248
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,260
我相信它真實存在
I believe it exists.

249
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,620
圣經告訴我們
The Bible tells us it

250
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,300
它包含了人類第一次反叛的根源
contained the seed of man's first disobedience.

251
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,970
而我們相信
But there are those of us who believe that

252
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:26,480
神或者其它遠古文明
God or some ancient civilization

253
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:30,980
給我們留下了理解人類為何會有暴力的指路圖
have left us a road map to understand why people are violent.

254
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,010
阿圭拉是所知的最后一個
Aguilar was the last

255
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:36,570
擁有這個蘋果的人
person known to have had it in his possession.

256
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,740
我們需要你來找出他把它藏在了哪里
We need you to find out where he hid it.

257
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,290
我還以為我來這里是接受治療的
I thought I was here to be cured.

258
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,870
暴力是一種病
Violence is a disease.

259
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,080
像癌癥一樣
Like cancer.

260
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:52,460
就像癌癥那樣 有朝一日我們希望能夠控制它
And like cancer, we hope to control it one day.

261
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,220
暴力支撐著我活到現在
Violence is what kept me alive.

262
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,970
嚴格意義上來說 你已經死了
Well technically, you're dead.

263
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:04,020
我餓了
I'm hungry.

264
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,940
我能得到什么好處
What's in it for me?

265
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,390
一旦我的研究完成
Once my research is complete,

266
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,190
你就沒必要待在這里了
there is no reason to keep you here.

267
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,610
我能拿回我的人生嗎
I get my life back?

268
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,910
比這更好 全新的生活
Better. A new one.

269
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,790
你餓了
You are hungry.

270
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,980
你不了解他是誰 他是怎么樣一個人
You don't know who he is, what he is.

271
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,770
他是個危險的男人
He is a dangerous man.

272
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,610
再給他點時間 埃米爾
Give him little more time, Emir.

273
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,980
要給人機會去證明他還留存這高貴的血液
Man may prove that has some noble blood in him yet.

274
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,280
坐這里怎么樣 先生
How about here, sir?

275
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:09,500
想點什么都可以 不過我們推薦雞肉
It's an open menu, but we do recommend a chicken.

276
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:19,590
您想吃點什么嗎 林奇先生 點什么都可以
What can I get you, Mr. Lynch? It's an open menu,

277
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,340
但我們推薦雞肉
but we do recommend a chicken.

278
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,470
我要牛排
I'll have steak.

279
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,560
給先驅者上牛排
Steak for the pioneer.

280
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,150
你是誰
Who are you?

281
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:39,360
大家叫我穆薩
They call me Moussa.

282
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:45,240
但我的名字是巴蒂斯特 我已經死了200年了
But my name is Baptiste. I'm dead 200 years now.

283
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:48,120
巫毒師
Voodoo poisoner.

284
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,080
我是人畜無害的
I'm harmless.

285
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,800
他們在觀察你
Ah  They're watching you.

286
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,010
等著看看你到底是誰 先驅者
Waiting to see who you are, pioneer.

287
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,640
你見過他了嗎
Have you met him yet?

288
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,230
你見過他了嗎
Have you met him yet?

289
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:18,570
我們是蘋果的最后保護者 朋友
We are the last to protect the Apple, my friend.

290
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:24,280
選錯了 你將讓我們全都萬劫不復
Pick the wrong choice, you'll send us all to infinity.

291
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,950
這個
This...

292
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:34,540
是屬于你的
belongs to you.

293
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,600
你會直接帶領他們找到伊甸蘋果嗎
You're going to lead them right to it.

294
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,520
不 我要吃了它
Ne, I'm going to eat it.

295
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,950
到底怎么回事
What the fuck is going on?

296
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,480
他必須再次進入阿尼姆斯
He has to go back in the Animus.

297
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,530
就現在
Now.

298
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,780
再次進去前他還需要更多時間
He needs more time before he goes in again.

299
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,740
我們沒時間了
We don't have time.

300
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,370
為什么
Why?

301
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,880
我不會拿他的命冒險
I won't risk his life.

302
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:04,090
那我只能吩咐別人去做了
Then I'll have to find someone else to do it.

303
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,960
- 你睡醒啦 重拳手 - 我瘋了
- You're up, slugger. - I'm crazy.

304
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,130
我瘋了
I'm crazy.

305
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:30,510
孤獨使我瘋狂
Crazy for feeling so lonely.

306
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,770
他們把他又抓回去了
They're getting him back in again.

307
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,320
我們要在他背叛我們之前采取行動
We should stop him before he betrays us.

308
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,110
把日期調到6號
Set the date for the six.

309
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:51,820
如果他的情況出現惡化 那就停止實驗
If his condition deteriorates, pull him out.

310
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,780
- 可是你的父親 - 我不在乎他說了什么
- You father... - I don't care what my father said.

311
00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:00,620
#何負於天下#
What in the world did I do?

312
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,960
- 卡爾聽我說 - #強至不能 戰至感己#
- Cal, listen to me. - I'm crazy for trying...

313
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,840
聽我說 你一定要跟阿圭拉保持同步
Listen to me. You have to stay with Aguilar.

314
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,300
#淚決堤#
Crazy for crying...

315
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,800
如果你停留在同步真空里 將會非常危險
Staying in synch-void could be dangerous.

316
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:15,970
#且為你癡狂#
And I'm crazy for loving you...

317
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:56,100
很快他們就會向格蘭納達進發
Soon they will march on Granada.

318
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:00,680
穆罕默德蘇丹的實力很弱
Sultan Muhammad is weak.

319
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,270
他不僅會交出伊甸蘋果
He'll surrender the Apple

320
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:09,440
還會為了救王子而背叛信條
and betray the Creed to save the prince.

321
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:14,660
情欲使吾儕軟弱
The love makes us weak.

322
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:24,920
幸然已鞠躬盡瘁
Gladly I'll sacrifice my flesh and blood,

323
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:27,630
只為信條永存
for survival of the Creed.

324
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:47,810
如果我死了 不要為我哭泣
When I die today, don't waste your tears for me.

325
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:37,820
耶和華訓示我們
The Lord spoke.

326
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:41,660
主說
And he said:

327
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:45,290
那不常跟我連結的人要被扔掉
"If a man abide not in me

328
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,870
像枯干的枝子 讓人撿去投在火里焚燒
he is cast into the fire

329
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:51,210
他將被焚燒
and he is burned!"

330
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,130
數十年來
For decades,

331
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:02,100
因為異教徒 我們活在支離破碎的
you have lived in the world torn apart

332
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:04,930
悲慘世界里
by religious discord.

333
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,270
但現在 多虧了主的榮恩
But soon, thanks to God

334
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,730
和宗教審判
and Inquisition

335
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:18,070
我們終將清除惡疾
we will purge this disease!

336
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:28,960
現在站在你們面前的罪人
The sinners before you,

337
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:33,380
曾試圖保護格拉納達的異教徒王子
sought to defend the heretic prince of Granada,

338
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,010
格拉納達是我們圣戰中
the last heathen stronghold

339
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:40,800
最后一個異教徒據點
in our holy war.

340
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:43,300
今天
So today,

341
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,430
在我們國王和王后的見證下
before our king and queen

342
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:50,640
我發誓我們將要在主賜的圣火中
I swear we shall wash ourselves clean,

343
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,060
洗濯污穢
in the holy fire of God!

344
00:47:58,190 --> 00:47:59,860
親眼目睹
Behold...

345
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:03,160
主的旨意
God's will!

346
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,600
你們要看著你們的導師先被燒死
You will watch your mentor

347
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:10,960
然后你們再慢慢被折磨至死
burn and then you will die the slowest.

348
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,430
為了明日榮耀
Give glory to the future.

349
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,770
愿犧牲自己
Not to us.

350
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,310
他同步了
He is synchronizing.

351
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,530
可惡的異教徒
Damned heretics!

352
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,340
別讓他們跑了
Don't let them escape!

353
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:22,140
快跳
Jump.

354
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,950
斷開同步完成
Complete desynch.

355
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,410
把他放下來
Get him down!

356
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:45,370
叫醫護人員過來
Call the medics!

357
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:55,630
沒事的 別出事 卡爾
Okay. It's okay. Cal, stay with me. Cal.

358
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,050
別 沒事的 快點啊
Stay... It's okay. Hurry up!

359
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:02,180
好了 看看我
Okay. Okay. Look at me.

360
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,190
看著我
Look at me.

361
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,760
我的腳沒有知覺了
I can't feel my legs.

362
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,340
暫時的麻痹而已
Paralysis is temporal.

363
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,970
那壞消息是什么
What's the bad news?

364
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:49,270
它導致你的系統神經斷裂 但這次我們會幫你
It caused a neurological split but we got you through it.

365
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:51,890
渡過難關
This time.

366
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,190
我遲早會死在這兒的 對吧
I'm gonna die in here, aren't I?

367
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,990
不會
No.

368
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:04,200
如果你能主動進去同步 你就不會死
Not if you go in there on your own free will.

369
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:09,540
我做不到
I can't do this.

370
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,330
不 你能做到的
Yes, you can.

371
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:16,250
伊甸蘋果 你是唯一一個能找到它的人
The Apple. You're the only one left who can find it.

372
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:21,130
我們可以了結這一切痛苦 卡爾
We can put an end to pain, Cal.

373
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:24,260
為了全人類
For everyone.

374
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:53,330
你從哪里找到的
Where did you get this?

375
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:56,130
我父親在你母親死的時候找到的
My father recovered it from the scene of your mother's murder.

376
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,880
然后把它帶到這里妥善保管
And brought it here for safekeeping.

377
00:57:58,920 --> 00:57:59,840
妥善保管
Safekeeping?

378
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:03,380
明明就是你把它偷走了
You stole it.

379
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:06,640
這是你母親的項鏈 我希望能物歸原主
It's your mother's necklace. I wanted you to have it.

380
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:09,760
他當時為什么會在那里
Why was he there?

381
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:11,770
- 為了救她 - 誰要殺她
- To save her. - From whom?

382
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:14,440
- 她自己人 - 那和你們有什么關系
- Her own people. - What's that got to do with you?

383
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:18,730
刺客與圣殿騎士之間的爭斗已經持續了數世紀
Assassins and Templars have been at war for centuries.

384
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,440
我的目標是改變這個局面
I aim to change that.

385
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:23,490
說的真好聽 我差點都忘了
That's right, I forgot.

386
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:25,820
我們的目的是戰勝暴力
We're here to combat aggression.

387
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:30,530
我想我可能不太吃你這一套
I don't think I like your methods.

388
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,410
我是個科學家
I am a scientist.

389
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,870
我在這兒是為了治愈暴力傾向
I'm here to be cured of violence.

390
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:40,920
那又有誰會來治愈你
Who's gonna cure you?

391
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,010
我們這是養虎為患
We're feeding the beast.

392
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:33,180
我們讓他越來越強大了
We're making him stronger.

393
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:48,450
我是里金醫生
I am Dr Rikkin.

394
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:52,450
叫我艾倫就好
Alan.

395
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:56,160
我在這兒管理阿布斯泰戈工業公司
I look after things here in Abstergo.

396
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
家族式企業 是嗎
You like to keep the things in the family, huh?

397
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:02,460
是的
Yes.

398
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:07,210
如果我們讓你覺得不適 我先道個歉
I'm sorry if we caused you any discomfort.

399
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:09,680
我有什么能夠幫得上忙嗎
Is there anything I can do?

400
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,340
那就放我出去吧
How about you let me out of here?

401
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:23,900
這個請求超出我的管理范圍
That's something I can't manage.

402
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:28,900
我是來跟你做個交易的
I'm here to make a deal.

403
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,610
我們需要伊甸蘋果
We need the Apple.

404
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:36,540
并且需要你幫我們拿到
And we need you to get it for us.

405
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:41,500
你在阿尼姆斯中已斷開同步連接
You've been desynching in the Animus.

406
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:45,040
我們需要你恢復同步
We need you not to do that.

407
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,210
要把我送回機器里嗎
Sending me back to the machine?

408
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:51,800
不必 你展現給我們的已經足夠了
No, you've already shown us what we needed to see.

409
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,590
那你會放我們自由嗎
Will you let us free then?

410
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:05,270
你究竟想從新來的那里獲取什么
What do you hope to gain from the newcomer?

411
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:10,150
對我們所有人都有好處的東西
Something that'll benefit us all.

412
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:14,620
你呢 穆薩
You too, Moussa.

413
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,430
你對他們做了什么
What have you done to them?

414
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,530
這就是依靠自己的意志力
It's what happens if you

415
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:47,650
進入回溯失敗的結果
don't enter in regression on your own volition.

416
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:56,660
還認得它嗎
Do you recognize this?

417
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,490
這是袖劍
It's Assassin's blade.

418
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,670
這就是當時
This is the actual one...

419
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,840
你父親奪取你母親性命的兇器
your father used to take your mother's life.

420
01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:14,760
他在這里 你知道嗎
He's here, you know?

421
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:23,730
母親的死亡
Mother's death, Cal.

422
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:27,770
這不是一個孩子應當面對的場景
Not something a boy should ever be made to see.

423
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:19,240
你不該那樣
This is wrong.

424
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:21,280
我別無他選
You left me no choice.

425
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:23,830
你說過 他必須靠自己的意志進入
He has to go in on his own free will, you said that.

426
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:27,290
- 我必須進行交涉 - 你是說操縱吧
- I had to negotiate. - You mean manipulate?

427
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:33,050
我向長老院保證我們會把伊甸蘋果帶到倫敦
I assured the Elders we would have the Apple for London.

428
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:38,840
只剩兩天時間了
That's in two days.

429
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:44,140
他不愿了解自己的過去或者親生父親
He doesn't want to know his past, or his father.

430
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,980
他只想將兩者并皆摧毀
He wants to destroy them, both.

431
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:50,940
我們可不是要干創造怪物的勾當
We're not in the business of creating monsters.

432
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,820
我們既不創造他們也不毀滅他們
We neither created them nor destroyed them.

433
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:56,820
我們只是放任他們于不可抵抗的信仰之中
We merely abandoned them to their own inexorable faith.

434
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:15,630
- 你是你母親所生 - 這說明什么
- You're your mother's son. - What does that mean?

435
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:21,550
你身體里流淌的血液并非只屬于你自己
Blood that flows through you is not your own.

436
01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:24,510
它屬于信條
Belongs to the Creed.

437
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:27,180
你母親早就知曉
Your mother knew that.

438
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,310
因她的死亡 信條才得以存活
She died so the Creed may live.

439
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:35,230
講清楚
Remind me how, exactly!

440
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,610
如你所見 是我所為
What you saw, I did.

441
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,830
你殺了她
You murdered her.

442
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:52,580
我寧可親自動手也不愿她被那個機器奪去生命
I took her life rather than have it stolen by that machine.

443
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:58,300
男人經歷考驗才能成長
Man grows with the greatness of his task.

444
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:02,300
我本該殺了你
I ought to have killed you.

445
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:06,850
但下不了手
I couldn't.

446
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:10,140
那就現在
Well, here.

447
01:05:11,390 --> 01:05:13,100
殺了我
Take it.

448
01:05:13,270 --> 01:05:15,440
完成你30年前該做的事
Do what you couldn't do 30 years ago.

449
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:17,520
袖劍現在在你的手里了 卡爾
It's in your hands now, Cal.

450
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:20,610
這是他們想要見到的
This is what they want.

451
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:23,200
讓我血濺當場
Spill my blood.

452
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:27,080
但是別回阿尼姆斯
But do not go back in the Animus.

453
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,700
為什么
Why?

454
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:34,540
伊甸蘋果蘊藏著自由意志的基因密碼
The Apple contains the genetic code for free will.

455
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:37,290
他們將利用這點消滅我們
They will use it to destroy us.

456
01:05:39,630 --> 01:05:41,340
我會找到伊甸蘋果
I'm gonna find it.

457
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:47,430
親眼見證他們毀滅你和你的信條
And watch them destroy you and your Creed.

458
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:50,770
你不可能消滅信條
You can not kill the Creed.

459
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,310
信條已融于你的血液之中
It's in your blood.

460
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:55,690
伊甸蘋果就是一切
The Apple is everything.

461
01:05:56,690 --> 01:05:58,400
你母親為了保護它而死
Your mother died to protect it.

462
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:03,740
她別無選擇
She had no choice.

463
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:14,580
我有
I do.

464
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,670
你要去毀滅信條
You're gonna kill the Creed!

465
01:07:10,850 --> 01:07:12,560
帶我去阿尼姆斯
Take me to the Animus.

466
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:22,730
讓我進入
Put me in.

467
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:24,860
機器準備
Prepare the Animus.

468
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:26,570
自愿回溯
Voluntary regression.

469
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:32,030
你知道刺客名字的由來嗎
Do you know how the Assassins came to be named?

470
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:36,710
它來源于阿拉伯文字 Hashashin
From an Arabic word "Hashashin".

471
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:39,330
他們屬于社會的異類
They were society's outcasts.

472
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:43,170
偷盜之人 死于非命之人
Those who stole, who murdered in cold blood.

473
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:49,340
遭唾棄之人 反叛者 愚蠢者 癮君子
People ridiculed them... Rebels, fools, drug addicts.

474
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,510
但他們又是睿智之人
But they were wise.

475
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:56,390
他們利用這點來掩藏
They used this reputation to hide the dedication to principles

476
01:07:56,730 --> 01:07:59,350
超越他們最強勁敵的信仰法則
beyond those of even their strongest enemies.

477
01:08:00,270 --> 01:08:04,780
為此我敬重他們
And for that I admire them.

478
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:10,610
但你不是他們其中一員
But you're not one of those men.

479
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:13,780
是嗎
Are you?

480
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:16,500
我們走著看
Let's find out.

481
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:26,050
啟動回溯
Commencing regression.

482
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:34,350
這是我的畢生之作
This is my life's work.

483
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:38,180
這是我的人生
It's my life.

484
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,110
為了信條
For the Creed.

485
01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:33,700
我們自己的人生
Our own lives...

486
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:37,240
重要的是我們曾留下的
What matters is what we leave behind.

487
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:56,180
蘇丹
Sultan...

488
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:58,810
交出伊甸蘋果
Surrender the Apple.

489
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:00,980
你的刺客護衛已死
Your Assassin protectors are gone.

490
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:04,940
信條已亡
The Creed is finished.

491
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:47,770
我的孩子
My son.

492
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:28,520
人類首次反抗和
Here lies the seed

493
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,400
自由意志的根源
of man's first disobedience,

494
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:35,400
就在于此
of free will itself.

495
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,170
多虧伊甸蘋果
Thanks to the Apple of Eden,

496
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,830
這已知世界
the known world

497
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:54,170
將迎來新紀元
shall be ushered into a new age.

498
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:57,300
新和平
One of peace,

499
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:01,550
那里所有征戰的人類
in which all the warring populations of mankind

500
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:04,600
都將絕對服從于
shall bow in perfect obedience

501
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:08,190
圣殿騎士的統治
to our one templar rule.

502
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,670
伊甸蘋果
The Apple.

503
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:18,420
交給他
Give it to him.

504
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:21,340
立刻
Now.

505
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:25,850
為了信條
For the Creed.

506
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:28,970
快
Go!

507
01:16:30,410 --> 01:16:32,120
原諒我
Forgive me.

508
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:11,220
都結束了
It's over!

509
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:18,430
刺客
Assassin!

510
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:49,130
信仰之躍
A leap of faith.

511
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:14,450
這是在哪兒
Where are we?

512
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:17,660
這里看起來像軍事港口
It looks like a military port.

513
01:19:30,290 --> 01:19:32,500
維爾瓦省 防空識別區
Kadiz, Palos de la Frontera.

514
01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:12,130
刺客們為它犧牲性命
The Assassins died for it.

515
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:15,300
你要用生命守護好它
Protect it with your life.

516
01:20:17,050 --> 01:20:18,800
我是刺客集團的友軍
I am a friend of the Creed.

517
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:28,020
把它帶進你墳墓里
Take it to your grave.

518
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:30,940
我發誓
I swear.

519
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,750
他說了什么 翻譯出來
What is it? Translation.

520
01:20:57,380 --> 01:20:59,160
追隨太陽之光芒
Following the light of the sun,

521
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:01,220
我將棄舊世于身后
I shall leave this old world behind.

522
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:04,350
他是克里斯托弗 哥倫布
It's Christopher Columbus.

523
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:06,770
他埋在哪了
Where is he buried?

524
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,890
他的遺體被遷回西班牙
His remains were returned to Spain.

525
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,940
墳墓在塞維利亞大教堂
His tomb is in Seville Cathedral.

526
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:17,740
我們找到了
We found it.

527
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,690
帥哥們 過來下
Hey All Stars, come here.

528
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:01,610
選一個
Pick one.

529
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:04,530
隨便哪個
Anyone.

530
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:15,210
- 公共休息室遭攻破 - 封鎖阿尼姆斯
- Breach in common room. - Seal the Animus.

531
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,230
這是記憶嗎
Is it a memory?

532
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,190
不是
No.

533
01:23:36,830 --> 01:23:38,540
來吧
Come on!

534
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,970
- 直升機呢 - 待命中
- Transport? - Standing by.

535
01:23:55,810 --> 01:23:58,480
保護阿尼姆斯 處理掉其他人
Protect the Animus. Purge the facility.

536
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:01,690
我得先把你護送出去
I need to get you out of here first.

537
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:11,200
- 不行 - 我們必須得走 索菲亞
- No! - We have to leave, Sophia.

538
01:24:54,290 --> 01:24:55,950
不
No!

539
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:58,500
不要
No!

540
01:25:10,430 --> 01:25:12,140
繼續戰斗
Pick it up!

541
01:25:25,270 --> 01:25:26,980
你不是孤單一人 卡爾
You are not alone, Cal.

542
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:30,450
從來不是
You never were.

543
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:46,460
- 開門 - 快點
- Open... - Come on.

544
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:03,850
當其他人盲目的追尋真相和真實的時候
Where other men blindly follow the truth,

545
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,400
- 記住 - 萬物皆虛
- remember... - Nothing is true.

546
01:26:08,610 --> 01:26:12,030
當其他人受到法律和道德的束縛的時候
Where other men are limited by morality or law,

547
01:26:13,950 --> 01:26:17,200
- 記住 - 萬事皆允
- remember... - Everything is permitted.

548
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:21,910
我們穿行于黑暗 追尋于光明
We work in the darkness to serve the light.

549
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,830
我們是刺客
We are Assassins.

550
01:26:55,030 --> 01:26:56,740
現在怎么做 先驅者
What now, pioneer?

551
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:03,290
戰斗
We fight.

552
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,310
閣下
Your Excellency.

553
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:00,900
榮耀屬于你父親
The glory will go to your father.

554
01:31:03,070 --> 01:31:04,780
但我們都清楚是誰找到了伊甸蘋果
But we both know who found it.

555
01:31:08,950 --> 01:31:10,620
你的時代即將來臨 我的孩子
Your time will come, my child.

556
01:32:09,140 --> 01:32:11,350
他們會給你的成就頒諾貝爾和平獎
They'll give you a Nobel peace prize for this.

557
01:32:11,890 --> 01:32:13,600
你最好開始寫獲獎致辭了
You better start writing your speech.

558
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:18,520
- 我讀了你的演講稿 - 怎么
- I've read yours. - And?

559
01:32:22,730 --> 01:32:25,900
如果根除自由意志 我們就能鏟除刺客
If we eradicate free will, we eradicate the Assassins.

560
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:29,320
這些瘡害社會數百年的毒瘤
A cancer that has menaced society for centuries.

561
01:32:30,990 --> 01:32:35,080
這篇不是我最出色的稿子 但扼住了要點
It's not my best work, but it gets the point across.

562
01:32:36,910 --> 01:32:39,000
我們一直在尋找出路
We've been looking for solutions.

563
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:43,050
你解決了這個問題
You've eliminated the problem.

564
01:32:57,270 --> 01:32:58,980
所以說 我的項目
So my program...

565
01:32:59,230 --> 01:33:01,860
第一次為社會帶來了秩序
Has brought order to society for the first time.

566
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:07,030
我對這件事負責
I'm accountable for this.

567
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:09,030
早有人為你的行為負責
You've already been accounted for.

568
01:33:09,110 --> 01:33:11,030
我們做的一切都屬于長老院
Our work belongs to the Elders.

569
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:13,030
現在是他們的決勝時刻
This is their finest hour.

570
01:33:16,870 --> 01:33:18,620
你騙了我
You lied to me.

571
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:20,330
我一直都知道
I've always known

572
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:24,550
在你心底 科學第一 圣殿騎士第二
that in your heart you're a scientist first, templar second.

573
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:27,920
你近期的成就令人震撼
Your recent work has impressed as much

574
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:31,760
但也證實了我們的信條
but it has confirmed our belief that mankind

575
01:33:32,510 --> 01:33:34,180
人類無法被救贖
cannot be redeemed.

576
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:35,970
你一切都算計清楚了
You've thought of everything.

577
01:33:37,810 --> 01:33:39,360
也不盡然
Not quite. My speech.

578
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:42,770
我的演講需要你簡練大方的開場白
It could do with one of your elegant openings.

579
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:47,480
如今我成了死神
Now I've become death,

580
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:50,650
世界的毀滅者
the destroyer of worlds.

581
01:33:52,910 --> 01:33:54,620
這話似乎上不了臺面
Not sure that I could make that work.

582
01:34:11,930 --> 01:34:15,260
今晚我無比榮幸在此介紹
It is with great pleasure tonight that I introduce

583
01:34:15,390 --> 01:34:18,970
我們遵從古訓之未來的締造者
the architect of our ancient order's future.

584
01:34:21,310 --> 01:34:25,360
讓我們歡迎阿布斯泰戈公司的首席執行官
Please welcome the CEO of Abstergo Foundation,

585
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:27,190
艾倫 里金博士
Dr. Alan Rikkin.

586
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:44,960
重獲伊甸蘋果之后
With the recovery of the Apple,

587
01:34:45,580 --> 01:34:47,420
我們現已掌握
we are now in possession

588
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:50,210
決定人類天性與本能的
of the complete genetic road map

589
01:34:50,630 --> 01:34:52,680
完整基因譜圖
to humanity's instincts.

590
01:34:54,010 --> 01:34:56,890
任何對于獨立
Any impulse towards independence,

591
01:34:57,430 --> 01:34:59,350
抵抗和反叛的沖動
resistance or rebellion

592
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:01,850
都將被瓦解
will be crushed.

593
01:35:02,850 --> 01:35:06,400
任何可能阻礙我們時代前進步伐的傾向
Any predisposition that might oppose our march of progress

594
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:10,400
現可被根除
can now be eradicated.

595
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,910
我只想大呼
All I have to do is shout.

596
01:35:20,370 --> 01:35:22,080
我是來幫你的
I'm here to help you.

597
01:35:23,620 --> 01:35:25,330
而你也要幫我
And you're here to help me.

598
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:29,090
我無法再幫你了
I can't help you anymore.

599
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:32,340
那些宏偉的計劃呢
What about all those great plans?

600
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:37,550
治療暴力 戰勝侵略性
Cure violence, combat aggression.

601
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:42,470
這些都不可能發生了
That's not going to happen.

602
01:35:49,820 --> 01:35:52,530
此事因你而起 蘇菲亞 別想一走了之
You've started this, Sophie. You don't get to walk away.

603
01:35:54,700 --> 01:35:56,410
我們都知道接下來會變成怎樣
We both know what happens next.

604
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:04,460
不是所有人都有資格活在世上
Not everything deserves to live.

605
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:09,460
我不能這么做
I can't do this.

606
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:17,470
你可以的
Yes, you can.

607
01:36:29,650 --> 01:36:31,860
但這不是為了我們自己
But it is not to ourselves,

608
01:36:32,650 --> 01:36:35,610
而是我們必須給予榮耀于未來
but to the future, that we must give glory.

609
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:39,990
迎接一個徹底清除刺客集團的未來
A future purged of the Assassin's Creed!

610
01:36:57,510 --> 01:36:59,220
女士們 先生們

伊甸蘋果
the Apple of Eden.

612
01:38:27,890 --> 01:38:29,600
這是我造成的
I did this.

613
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,490
我會為長者會奪回伊甸蘋果
I will retrieve the artifact for the Elders.

614
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:48,910
我要為自己拿回來
Lynch I want for me.

615
01:39:06,470 --> 01:39:07,720
這不是為了我們自己
It is not to ourselves,

616
01:39:07,810 --> 01:39:10,060
而是為了未來 我們必須給予榮耀

幾個世紀來 圣殿騎士團一直在

尋找著神秘的伊甸蘋果

627
00:00:54,970 --> 00:01:07,060
他們堅信里面不僅包含人類第一次反抗的根源

628
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:08,330
還有自由意志的關鍵

629
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:11,410
如果他們找到遺物并解開其中的秘密

630
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:13,490
他們就擁有了控制所有自由意志的能力

631
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:16,100
只有刺客兄弟會在阻止他們
