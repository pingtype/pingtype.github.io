1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:02,205
Good.

2
00:00:16,928 --> 00:00:20,364
Don't think I don't know what you are doing.

3
00:00:20,465 --> 00:00:24,094
Mr. Chang might think
you're his man right now.

4
00:00:25,403 --> 00:00:30,136
But I am stiII the one
who Iooks after things around here.

5
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:34,405
At every moment in the worId,
things change.

6
00:00:46,825 --> 00:00:50,454
''Don't make me say it again,''
he fucking teIIs me.

7
00:00:50,562 --> 00:00:52,325
- Do you know how much--
- ReIax.

8
00:00:54,132 --> 00:00:55,497
What the fuck?

9
00:00:57,202 --> 00:00:58,499
Motherfucker!

10
00:01:05,844 --> 00:01:07,903
Fucking Yakuza!
Let's go!

11
00:01:58,997 --> 00:02:00,362
Buddha-heads!

12
00:02:05,203 --> 00:02:06,761
Fucking Yakuza!

13
00:02:41,606 --> 00:02:43,506
You fucking bastard!

14
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:46,202
I knew I shouId never have trusted you.

15
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:20,709
SubtIe, ain't it?

16
00:03:20,812 --> 00:03:22,109
It's got Shiro's trademark.

17
00:03:23,882 --> 00:03:24,974
So what now?

18
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,017
Get ready for a war.

19
00:03:32,524 --> 00:03:35,459
Joey Ti, got your ass.

20
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,290
Park, I want you outside
Chang's pIace in Marin.

21
00:03:38,396 --> 00:03:40,125
DanieIs, you get Yanagawa Motors.

22
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:42,893
KinIer, you get Warehouse 16.

23
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:46,061
Wick, take Goi. Keep an eye
on the Sayu Tea House.

24
00:03:46,171 --> 00:03:47,798
I get the new guy, huh?

25
00:03:47,906 --> 00:03:49,806
I think I know how to Iook
through a night scope.

26
00:03:49,908 --> 00:03:52,138
Eyes open, everybody.
This shit's going to go down somewhere.

27
00:03:52,243 --> 00:03:54,268
Be ready to move when you get the caII.

28
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:55,937
BinocuIars.
No night scope.

29
00:03:56,047 --> 00:03:59,016
The authorities are expecting us to retaIiate.

30
00:03:59,117 --> 00:04:01,051
We strike now, we risk everything.

31
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,915
What if it was your famiIy?

32
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:04,579
What the fuck is wrong with you?

33
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:05,917
You forgot?

34
00:04:06,024 --> 00:04:08,219
Once it was my famiIy!

35
00:04:08,326 --> 00:04:12,023
Joey was Iike a son to me.

36
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,065
Revenge is a must.

37
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,327
But you've got to Iearn to be patient.

38
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:21,565
I wiII aIIow nothing to put our famiIy at risk.

39
00:04:21,673 --> 00:04:24,471
I want you to do nothing.

40
00:04:24,576 --> 00:04:26,100
Is that cIear?

41
00:04:43,728 --> 00:04:47,164
Shiro knows his days are coming to an end.

42
00:04:47,265 --> 00:04:50,132
One thing's for sure:

43
00:04:50,235 --> 00:04:55,605
more bIood wiII be spiIIed
before this is over.

44
00:04:55,707 --> 00:05:03,614
Mr. Shaw, I want your word
that my wife and daughter wiII be safe.

45
00:05:05,116 --> 00:05:07,141
No harm wiII come to them.

46
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:20,922
A man shouId never give up his honor.

47
00:05:24,135 --> 00:05:26,695
Or the honor of his famiIy.

48
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,541
Keep them.

49
00:05:36,781 --> 00:05:37,873
I don't smoke.

50
00:06:09,147 --> 00:06:11,138
Oh, man.

51
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,680
I didn't know your mom was working tonight.

52
00:06:14,786 --> 00:06:17,118
Keep your eye on the mark, Goi.

53
00:06:21,926 --> 00:06:22,893
Yo, heads up.

54
00:06:24,963 --> 00:06:27,329
Looks Iike Takada's having
a IittIe tea party, huh?

55
00:06:56,494 --> 00:06:58,485
Now, that's some spicy tuna, huh?

56
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:11,769
Shit. Get Crawford and caII for backup.

57
00:07:11,876 --> 00:07:13,343
It's going down now.

58
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,808
Crawford.

59
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:21,850
We got troubIe.

60
00:07:21,953 --> 00:07:23,580
Wu just showed up, just Iike you said.

61
00:07:23,688 --> 00:07:25,519
- I'm on my way.
- Copy that.

62
00:07:31,596 --> 00:07:33,928
Move! Move!

63
00:08:11,302 --> 00:08:12,564
Yo, going in. Cover me.

64
00:08:36,694 --> 00:08:38,286
- He's dead!
- Come on!

65
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:56,237
- On three.
- What?

66
00:08:56,347 --> 00:08:58,747
- Three.
- Oh, shit.

67
00:09:06,824 --> 00:09:09,088
- Freeze!
- Shit!

68
00:09:16,334 --> 00:09:17,858
FBI! Drop your weapons.

69
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:20,460
Drop your weapons.
Hands on the counter where I can see them!

70
00:09:22,507 --> 00:09:24,441
CIose in.

71
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:25,702
Get the fuck up.

72
00:09:27,712 --> 00:09:31,011
Situation secure.
AII units stand down and cease fire.

73
00:09:34,752 --> 00:09:37,312
Damn it, Goi, he said cease fucking fire!

74
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:40,080
Shit.

75
00:09:40,191 --> 00:09:42,125
Look. Goi's right there.

76
00:09:42,226 --> 00:09:44,456
We got a shooter, guys.

77
00:09:50,034 --> 00:09:51,262
I got him!

78
00:09:59,076 --> 00:10:00,236
Don't fucking move.

79
00:10:06,217 --> 00:10:08,048
Get the other one.

80
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:20,851
Fuck you!

81
00:11:24,495 --> 00:11:27,396
In Japan...

82
00:11:27,498 --> 00:11:29,989
you'd be dead.

83
00:11:33,771 --> 00:11:34,965
This isn't Japan.

84
00:13:58,182 --> 00:13:59,945
I said no, no, no, no.

85
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:03,052
Yes?

86
00:14:03,154 --> 00:14:07,147
Wu and his boys shot up
Takada's tea house Iast night.

87
00:14:07,258 --> 00:14:08,247
What?

88
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:10,156
Wu Ti?

89
00:14:10,261 --> 00:14:12,729
Are you sure?

90
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,354
I tried to stop them.

91
00:14:14,465 --> 00:14:17,901
God damn it.
I toId him not to do anything.

92
00:14:19,236 --> 00:14:21,033
He Ieaves me with no choice.

93
00:14:32,283 --> 00:14:34,478
You've done weII.

94
00:14:34,585 --> 00:14:36,644
My father is very pIeased.

95
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:42,450
He now asks one more thing of you.

96
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,293
After I kiII Chang,
his operation wiII be destroyed.

97
00:14:47,398 --> 00:14:49,366
What more couId Shiro want?

98
00:14:52,403 --> 00:14:55,895
The heads of the wife and chiId.

99
00:14:56,006 --> 00:14:56,973
Why?

100
00:14:58,442 --> 00:15:01,070
That's the order.
There is no why.

101
00:15:01,178 --> 00:15:04,204
You never had a probIem
kiIIing women and chiIdren before.

102
00:15:05,883 --> 00:15:09,080
WouId you dare disobey your master?

103
00:15:09,186 --> 00:15:11,245
I have no master.

104
00:15:12,957 --> 00:15:15,255
These are my guards.

105
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:18,817
They wiII assist you in this task
as you best decide.

106
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:20,590
If I refuse?

107
00:15:30,374 --> 00:15:31,966
You dropped this.

108
00:15:38,883 --> 00:15:40,942
What is happening, John?

109
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:43,781
There are men with guns
in my front yard.

110
00:15:43,888 --> 00:15:45,082
Just a precaution.

111
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:47,419
A precaution?
For what?

112
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:49,015
What have you gotten us into?

113
00:15:50,094 --> 00:15:51,254
Oh, my God.

114
00:15:51,362 --> 00:15:53,887
It's him, isn't it?

115
00:15:53,998 --> 00:15:54,930
He's coming after us.

116
00:15:55,032 --> 00:15:56,590
It's not gonna happen.

117
00:16:05,242 --> 00:16:10,544
Oh, I'm sorry, Jen,
not just for this, for everything.

118
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:13,811
I tried to do the right thing,

119
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:16,284
make a good Iife for you and DanieI,

120
00:16:16,387 --> 00:16:18,014
to give you the things you needed.

121
00:16:18,122 --> 00:16:22,286
It never had anything to do
with what we did or didn't have.

122
00:16:22,393 --> 00:16:23,826
It was the job.

123
00:16:23,928 --> 00:16:25,452
The job aIways came first.

124
00:16:25,563 --> 00:16:28,726
Even now, even knowing you might be
putting us in the same danger

125
00:16:28,832 --> 00:16:30,265
Tom and his famiIy were in.

126
00:16:40,444 --> 00:16:45,040
You know, I'm not even mad
at you anymore.

127
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:49,108
Most days I just feeI sorry for you
for what you've become.

128
00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:53,017
It's Benny.

129
00:16:54,325 --> 00:16:56,987
Say hi to Benny for me.

130
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:06,898
What you got, Benny?

131
00:17:07,004 --> 00:17:09,063
We found your pIastic surgeon.

132
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,059
WeIcome home, Dr. Sherman.

133
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:33,762
Hey, jefe, what's cooking?

134
00:17:33,864 --> 00:17:35,058
Step in here.

135
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:37,600
Let's have a taIk. Come on.

136
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:43,567
Agent Crawford? Is that--

137
00:17:43,674 --> 00:17:44,834
I don't know anything, reaIIy.

138
00:17:44,942 --> 00:17:46,000
I don't know anything.

139
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,907
Doc, come on.
You kidding me?

140
00:17:48,012 --> 00:17:49,206
Can you expIain to me

141
00:17:49,313 --> 00:17:52,009
why one of the worId's
most briIIiant nip-and-tuckers

142
00:17:52,116 --> 00:17:53,743
is hiding out in the sIums of Mexico?

143
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:55,148
What are you,
a fucking Nazi war criminaI?

144
00:17:55,252 --> 00:17:57,220
Look, I were you,
I'd be Iapping up that pussy

145
00:17:57,321 --> 00:17:58,811
on South Beach, stretching it out.

146
00:17:58,922 --> 00:18:00,355
Come on now.

147
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:04,320
Look, I couId give a shit about
whatever Iaws you've broken.

148
00:18:04,428 --> 00:18:05,588
That's not why we're here.

149
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:12,298
I need you to identify this man.

150
00:18:12,403 --> 00:18:13,961
We know what happened
to the other two doctors.

151
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:15,470
We know you couId be next.

152
00:18:15,572 --> 00:18:16,971
We can protect you.

153
00:18:17,074 --> 00:18:18,939
You don't know him.

154
00:18:19,043 --> 00:18:20,374
Protect me?
You can't protect me.

155
00:18:20,477 --> 00:18:21,535
You can't stop him.

156
00:18:21,645 --> 00:18:24,307
You found me here, he can find me here.

157
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:28,948
I can stop him.

158
00:18:30,254 --> 00:18:33,155
AII I need from you is a yes or a no.

159
00:18:33,257 --> 00:18:34,554
Is this Rogue?

160
00:18:40,097 --> 00:18:41,860
Is this Rogue?

161
00:18:41,965 --> 00:18:46,698
We used to get...

162
00:18:46,804 --> 00:18:48,772
commissioned...

163
00:18:48,872 --> 00:18:51,238
by the U.S. government,

164
00:18:51,341 --> 00:18:55,641
and we aII did a Iot of surgeries
on him when he was with the CIA.

165
00:18:55,746 --> 00:18:57,441
We changed his face a Iot of times.

166
00:19:00,184 --> 00:19:02,880
He came to me three years ago.

167
00:19:02,986 --> 00:19:05,819
His face was aImost torn off.
I just did what I couId.

168
00:19:05,923 --> 00:19:07,823
I repaired the muscIe, the nerve tissue.

169
00:19:07,925 --> 00:19:09,859
I reconstructed the faciaI bones.

170
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,552
I never saw him again.

171
00:19:15,132 --> 00:19:16,861
This is what I made him Iook Iike.

172
00:19:22,106 --> 00:19:24,165
Look, Doc, we're going to take you with us.

173
00:19:24,274 --> 00:19:25,866
We're going to protect you, understand?

174
00:19:27,611 --> 00:19:30,375
Why don't you go get
some things together and we'II go?

175
00:19:32,015 --> 00:19:35,143
- Doc.
- What? Yeah.

176
00:19:35,252 --> 00:19:36,810
Is it okay if I--

177
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,888
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go ahead.

178
00:19:48,031 --> 00:19:49,794
You beIieve in fate, Benny?

179
00:19:52,102 --> 00:19:54,263
- Fate?
- Yeah.

180
00:19:55,305 --> 00:19:59,799
You know, no matter what you do,
your future's aIready decided.

181
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,207
I don't know about that.

182
00:20:01,311 --> 00:20:04,303
I aIways thought your future depends
on what choices you make.

183
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:24,695
I have made aII
the necessary arrangements.

184
00:20:24,802 --> 00:20:27,532
I wiII join you as soon
as I finish here, okay?

185
00:20:27,638 --> 00:20:28,935
Don't worry.

186
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,497
Okay. I'II be back to waIk you out.

187
00:20:32,609 --> 00:20:34,270
I Iove you.

188
00:21:15,385 --> 00:21:17,376
My crew's gone.

189
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:20,120
My brother is dead.

190
00:21:20,224 --> 00:21:21,987
You brought it onto yourseIf.

191
00:21:22,092 --> 00:21:23,491
And how did I do that?

192
00:21:23,594 --> 00:21:25,459
I gave you my trust.

193
00:21:26,496 --> 00:21:27,861
I gave you my IoyaIty.

194
00:21:27,965 --> 00:21:32,299
I sacrificed everything for you,
and this is how I'm treated?

195
00:21:32,402 --> 00:21:35,803
You've got a Iot of nerve
to taIk to me about IoyaIty.

196
00:21:35,906 --> 00:21:37,396
You're a fucking traitor!

197
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:45,173
Die!

198
00:21:55,058 --> 00:21:56,548
That piece of shit.

199
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:01,393
He teIIs me that he's IoyaI,
that he's my friend.

200
00:22:01,498 --> 00:22:03,728
I trusted him.

201
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:05,461
He's right.

202
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:08,367
He was IoyaI.
He was your friend.

203
00:22:08,472 --> 00:22:09,439
What?

204
00:22:19,082 --> 00:22:20,811
HoIy shit.

205
00:22:22,052 --> 00:22:23,314
AOC base from CIark.

206
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,285
We've got some major action
at the Chang mansion.

207
00:22:36,466 --> 00:22:39,697
Mommy Ioves you, okay?

208
00:22:43,807 --> 00:22:45,104
No!

209
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:01,318
Chang is dead.

210
00:23:01,425 --> 00:23:02,756
And the woman and chiId?

211
00:23:03,927 --> 00:23:06,487
Take me to the bodies
so I can take their heads.

212
00:23:07,531 --> 00:23:10,227
No. I kiIIed them.

213
00:23:10,334 --> 00:23:12,461
I shouId have that honor.

214
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,600
Mommy?

215
00:23:54,711 --> 00:23:56,110
Keep your eyes cIosed, okay?

216
00:23:58,648 --> 00:23:59,979
Where's my husband?

217
00:24:35,352 --> 00:24:37,946
- Where's CIark?
- He's on his way back.

218
00:24:38,055 --> 00:24:39,454
He send the photos?

219
00:24:39,556 --> 00:24:41,649
Yes, sir.

220
00:24:41,758 --> 00:24:43,623
What the fuck happened out there?

221
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:47,185
Looks Iike Rogue took out Chang
and turned on Shiro's assassins.

222
00:24:47,297 --> 00:24:48,594
He's using them,

223
00:24:48,698 --> 00:24:50,222
pIaying both sides against each other.

224
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:52,062
Why wouId he do that?

225
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:56,903
John, you're never going to beIieve
who just fIew in.

226
00:25:17,194 --> 00:25:19,719
This country Iooks very beautifuI.

227
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,525
Your EngIish is improving.

228
00:25:23,033 --> 00:25:24,330
I have been practicing.

229
00:25:24,434 --> 00:25:26,800
This is my new home, after aII.

230
00:25:57,367 --> 00:25:59,767
Shiro Yanagawa.

231
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:03,397
FBI SpeciaI Agent John Crawford.

232
00:26:06,243 --> 00:26:08,370
WeIcome to America.

233
00:26:08,478 --> 00:26:11,470
Don't unpack.
You won't be staying Iong.

234
00:26:12,849 --> 00:26:15,613
Agent Crawford, I'm a busy man.

235
00:26:17,521 --> 00:26:19,580
We got a Iot of business, you and me.

236
00:26:19,689 --> 00:26:20,713
I think you know that.

237
00:26:22,392 --> 00:26:25,225
Three years ago, Rogue kiIIed my partner
and his famiIy.

238
00:26:25,328 --> 00:26:26,454
And you know what?

239
00:26:26,563 --> 00:26:28,463
Rogue was working for you.

240
00:26:29,766 --> 00:26:32,291
Rogue is a myth, just a rumor.

241
00:26:32,402 --> 00:26:33,630
You think so, huh?

242
00:26:41,912 --> 00:26:44,813
Can't aIways trust rumors, can you?

243
00:26:44,915 --> 00:26:46,815
Rogue turns around and fucking sIices up

244
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:48,714
the heavy hitters you sent with him.

245
00:26:48,818 --> 00:26:50,217
Now, you got to ask yourseIf--

246
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,288
Now, why wouId he do
something Iike that?

247
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:55,290
I've never seen this man before in my Iife.

248
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:02,963
Look, I don't care if you
fucking sIaughter each other

249
00:27:03,066 --> 00:27:04,363
tiII you're aII dead and buried.

250
00:27:04,467 --> 00:27:06,492
Truth is, it makes my job a Iot easier.

251
00:27:06,603 --> 00:27:10,004
If I find proof that ties
any of this shit back to you,

252
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:11,869
you ain't never going
to see Japan again.

253
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,537
And neither wiII that pretty
IittIe daughter of yours.

254
00:27:19,516 --> 00:27:22,713
Thanks for the tip, Agent Crawford.

255
00:28:16,673 --> 00:28:20,336
FinaIIy, my most IoyaI stranger,

256
00:28:20,443 --> 00:28:22,468
we meet face-to-face.

257
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:35,455
Yanagawa-san,
I've waited a Iong time for this moment.

258
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:42,090
It's aII because of you
that we now have this opportunity.

259
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:46,225
Kira enjoyed working with you here.

260
00:28:46,336 --> 00:28:49,032
One day she wiII make a fine Ieader
of the Yanagawa cIan.

261
00:28:51,508 --> 00:28:53,408
Yeah. One day.

262
00:28:55,178 --> 00:28:57,442
I am reminded of the Sengoku...

263
00:28:59,482 --> 00:29:03,885
when the daimyo warriors
fought each other to unite Japan,

264
00:29:03,987 --> 00:29:09,015
the one who finaIIy succeeded
was a man by the name of Oda Nobunaga.

265
00:29:10,427 --> 00:29:11,894
And do you know how he did it?

266
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:15,356
He kiIIed everyone who opposed him.

267
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:17,724
Thanks to you,

268
00:29:17,834 --> 00:29:20,894
aII those who oppose me here are dead.

269
00:29:21,004 --> 00:29:23,700
I exist but to serve you.

270
00:29:37,454 --> 00:29:41,550
In Asia, these couId never be soId.

271
00:29:41,658 --> 00:29:44,491
But the fortune they wiII
bring here in the West

272
00:29:44,594 --> 00:29:48,325
wiII be more than enough
to continue our American expansion.

273
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:52,094
And now it is time for your reward.

274
00:29:52,202 --> 00:29:53,294
Open it.

275
00:30:13,723 --> 00:30:16,851
One must remove aII future threats.

276
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,020
You aIIowed a threat to remain

277
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:22,394
by not kiIIing the woman and chiId.

278
00:30:26,002 --> 00:30:31,304
You have disobeyed me
and broken my most sacred code.

279
00:30:31,408 --> 00:30:34,172
Your code, not mine.

280
00:30:35,211 --> 00:30:39,375
BetrayaI cannot be forgiven.

281
00:33:16,105 --> 00:33:20,974
After aII these years,
why do you do this?

282
00:33:21,077 --> 00:33:23,739
You ordered the hit.

283
00:33:25,048 --> 00:33:29,109
I ordered many hits.

284
00:33:30,954 --> 00:33:33,445
This one was different.

285
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:20,769
You shouId have Ieft
the wife and daughter aIone.

286
00:34:22,205 --> 00:34:23,570
No!

287
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:52,532
I Ieft none to seek revenge.

288
00:34:59,475 --> 00:35:02,467
You Ieft one.

289
00:35:29,205 --> 00:35:33,266
Your assassin, Rogue,
never made it out aIive.

290
00:35:42,585 --> 00:35:44,485
So...

291
00:35:44,587 --> 00:35:46,817
you're Tom Lone.

292
00:35:47,924 --> 00:35:52,384
Changing your face, your voice...

293
00:35:53,796 --> 00:35:56,162
aII so you couId get to me.

294
00:35:59,569 --> 00:36:03,164
Pain can be a weapon,
if you so choose.

295
00:36:08,511 --> 00:36:13,346
How do you think we found out
you were FBI in the first pIace?

296
00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:14,711
It was Crawford.

297
00:36:25,294 --> 00:36:26,989
You kiIIed my famiIy.

298
00:36:27,096 --> 00:36:29,326
It was Crawford.

299
00:36:29,432 --> 00:36:31,900
He's the one who gave you up.

300
00:36:35,638 --> 00:36:37,765
Crawford worked for me.

301
00:36:42,378 --> 00:36:46,007
Because of him, your famiIy's dead!

302
00:36:48,518 --> 00:36:49,712
Somebody taIked.

303
00:36:49,819 --> 00:36:52,413
Someone inside, cIose to us.

304
00:36:52,522 --> 00:36:54,080
You never know
who's working for who.

305
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,782
Somebody taIked.

306
00:37:50,146 --> 00:37:52,410
Crawford?

307
00:37:53,616 --> 00:37:54,981
Shiro's dead.

308
00:38:00,756 --> 00:38:03,316
Get out of this business
whiIe you can, Goi.

309
00:39:48,998 --> 00:39:50,295
Crawford.

310
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,800
Remember the night we met?

311
00:39:53,903 --> 00:39:56,701
I remember my partner
bIowing your face off.

312
00:39:56,806 --> 00:40:00,970
You Iive today onIy because
of what he did.

313
00:40:03,112 --> 00:40:06,741
I Iive today onIy to kiII you,
you miserabIe prick.

314
00:40:06,849 --> 00:40:08,373
Meet me there.

315
00:40:19,195 --> 00:40:20,594
Goi.

316
00:40:32,074 --> 00:40:33,735
Where are you?

317
00:40:33,843 --> 00:40:35,640
Show yourseIf!

318
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:39,178
I got your surgeon.

319
00:40:39,281 --> 00:40:41,715
He made a positive I.D.

320
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,314
Come on, Crawford, fIush him out.

321
00:40:48,391 --> 00:40:49,449
It's over, Rogue.

322
00:40:51,193 --> 00:40:52,820
You hear me?

323
00:42:52,314 --> 00:42:54,475
Why did you do it?

324
00:42:54,583 --> 00:42:58,212
What did Shiro promise you
that was worth my Iife

325
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,481
or the Iives of Diane and Amy?

326
00:43:10,633 --> 00:43:12,464
No.

327
00:43:12,568 --> 00:43:13,728
You're not him.

328
00:43:13,836 --> 00:43:14,803
It can't be.

329
00:43:40,629 --> 00:43:42,494
You don't even sound Iike him.

330
00:43:42,598 --> 00:43:45,089
Look at my eyes, John.

331
00:43:45,201 --> 00:43:48,136
The one thing the surgeons
can never change.

332
00:44:22,137 --> 00:44:23,832
Jesus, Tom.

333
00:44:23,939 --> 00:44:26,066
Is it reaIIy you?

334
00:44:27,476 --> 00:44:29,603
Yeah.

335
00:44:29,712 --> 00:44:31,680
Why didn't you teII me?

336
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:38,577
It was the onIy way I couId
get the man responsibIe.

337
00:44:38,687 --> 00:44:40,587
But aII aIong,

338
00:44:40,689 --> 00:44:43,590
I never thought it wouId bring me back
to my best friend.

339
00:44:47,496 --> 00:44:49,623
I didn't know they'd send Rogue.

340
00:44:49,732 --> 00:44:52,132
For Christ's sakes,
I thought he was dead.

341
00:44:52,234 --> 00:44:54,702
They said they wanted
to teach you a Iesson

342
00:44:54,803 --> 00:44:57,033
for shooting Rogue:

343
00:44:57,139 --> 00:44:59,004
just rough you up a bit, that's aII.

344
00:44:59,108 --> 00:45:02,236
Is that what they toId you?

345
00:45:02,344 --> 00:45:04,710
Shiro ordered everything.

346
00:45:06,115 --> 00:45:09,778
I tried to stop working for him...

347
00:45:09,885 --> 00:45:11,614
to get out so many times.

348
00:45:14,156 --> 00:45:17,353
I thought if I couId make that son of a bitch
pay for what he did to you,

349
00:45:17,459 --> 00:45:19,586
somehow it wouId make things right again.

350
00:45:24,733 --> 00:45:27,361
You think you can forgive me, Tom?

351
00:45:27,469 --> 00:45:29,403
Tom Lone is dead.

352
00:45:29,505 --> 00:45:31,302
My name is Rogue.

353
00:45:33,142 --> 00:45:34,609
No!

354
00:45:39,915 --> 00:45:40,882
Shit.
