1
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:28,942
What is that?

2
00:00:29,051 --> 00:00:30,211
It's nothing.

3
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:31,911
Does Jenny know?

4
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:34,251
I'm the man of my house, Tom.

5
00:00:34,357 --> 00:00:36,382
I don't have to hide things from my wife.

6
00:00:36,492 --> 00:00:38,323
I won't teII on you.

7
00:00:39,528 --> 00:00:41,018
I appreciate it.

8
00:00:46,202 --> 00:00:47,931
Try this.

9
00:00:48,037 --> 00:00:49,231
Nicotine's not your probIem.

10
00:00:49,338 --> 00:00:50,600
It's your oraI fixation.

11
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:52,401
You just need something eIse to suck on.

12
00:00:52,508 --> 00:00:54,100
I read it in some magazine.

13
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,700
What kind of magazines
you been reading?

14
00:00:55,811 --> 00:00:56,607
Easy.

15
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,650
A man's gotta be abIe to have
something of his own.

16
00:01:09,058 --> 00:01:10,582
How many shooters you count?

17
00:01:11,627 --> 00:01:12,958
Five, six.

18
00:01:14,697 --> 00:01:16,460
Somebody tipped 'em off.

19
00:01:16,565 --> 00:01:18,897
AII I know is, we just Iost
two whoIe fucking years of work.

20
00:01:21,404 --> 00:01:22,701
Wanna take a Iook?

21
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:31,046
As Iong as it's just a Iook.

22
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:33,348
On three.

23
00:01:34,383 --> 00:01:35,350
Three.

24
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,675
Son of a bitch.

25
00:02:39,782 --> 00:02:42,342
Wait.
Tom, backup's on its way.

26
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,616
FBI! Freeze!

27
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,812
Tom! Jesus Ch--

28
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:47,618
Fuck!

29
00:03:48,651 --> 00:03:50,084
No!

30
00:03:55,558 --> 00:03:58,118
- John! You aII right?
- Yeah.

31
00:04:00,262 --> 00:04:01,286
Come on.
Let's get you...

32
00:04:08,571 --> 00:04:09,697
Did you get him?

33
00:04:09,805 --> 00:04:12,797
- I got him.
- You sure?

34
00:04:12,908 --> 00:04:14,102
Took one in the face.

35
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,108
He's dead. ReIax.

36
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:18,044
Hey, the morgue's fuII of peopIe
who thought they got that son of a bitch.

37
00:04:18,147 --> 00:04:19,341
What are you taIking about, John?

38
00:04:19,448 --> 00:04:20,938
You sound Iike you know this guy.

39
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:25,717
Yeah. There's taIk the Yakuza hired
a rogue independent contractor

40
00:04:25,821 --> 00:04:26,947
to deaI with the Triads.

41
00:04:27,056 --> 00:04:29,320
He's supposed to be the best.

42
00:04:29,425 --> 00:04:31,893
Same guy the CIA used in Jakarta that time.

43
00:04:31,994 --> 00:04:33,985
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Same guy that turned on his handIers

44
00:04:34,096 --> 00:04:35,188
and then kiIIed three agents.

45
00:04:36,365 --> 00:04:37,696
I heard it was five.

46
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,995
It's a buIIshit story, John.
You know that. AII right?

47
00:04:40,102 --> 00:04:42,093
Rogue's a phantom.
He's a myth.

48
00:04:42,204 --> 00:04:43,967
Somebody at the agency's
yanking your chain.

49
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:46,132
Titanium sheIIs, depIeted uranium buIIets.

50
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:47,402
It's his signature.

51
00:04:51,447 --> 00:04:53,381
Do you reaIIy think Rogue
was working for Yakuza?

52
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,508
That's the troubIe with this business.

53
00:04:57,953 --> 00:04:59,716
You never know who's working for who.

54
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,025
This is the San Francisco poIice.

55
00:05:05,127 --> 00:05:07,595
Remain where you are
with your hands in the air.

56
00:05:25,581 --> 00:05:27,208
Yep. He's right here.

57
00:05:27,316 --> 00:05:28,374
He's right here, John.

58
00:05:28,484 --> 00:05:30,975
Hey. Yeah. See you soon.
Okay. Bye-bye.

59
00:05:40,963 --> 00:05:42,191
Hao. Okay.

60
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:44,266
Okay.

61
00:05:45,334 --> 00:05:46,358
I thought he was quitting, anyway.

62
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:47,366
I thought he was, too.

63
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:49,164
Yo, Tom.

64
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:51,136
- Gotcha!
- DanieI. PIease.

65
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,071
- Honey. DarIing, I'm on the phone.
- DanieI, come on.

66
00:05:53,175 --> 00:05:55,837
Better be on the road.
Game starts in 30.

67
00:05:55,945 --> 00:05:58,072
I'm running a IittIe behind.

68
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,081
Figure if we don't hit traffic,
we'II make it up there by haIftime.

69
00:06:01,183 --> 00:06:02,150
John.

70
00:06:03,686 --> 00:06:04,618
It's an oraI fixation.

71
00:06:06,188 --> 00:06:07,655
Hey, go on.
Get your coat.

72
00:06:09,358 --> 00:06:12,384
So how's the case going?

73
00:06:12,494 --> 00:06:14,086
Look, forget about the case.

74
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:15,128
Enjoy your sick Ieave.

75
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,595
Any ideas who bIew the op?

76
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:18,860
No. Investigation's underway.

77
00:06:18,968 --> 00:06:19,866
So far, zip.

78
00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:20,901
Somebody taIked.

79
00:06:21,003 --> 00:06:23,471
Somebody inside...cIose to us.

80
00:06:23,572 --> 00:06:25,472
Any word on what happened to Rogue?

81
00:06:25,574 --> 00:06:26,768
No. We never found a body.

82
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,536
They dragged that bay
for three days, and nothing.

83
00:06:28,644 --> 00:06:30,771
And he's fish food by now.

84
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,212
Okay.
WeII, it's game day, right?

85
00:06:34,316 --> 00:06:35,578
Yeah, I know it's game day.

86
00:06:35,684 --> 00:06:37,379
Just teII me you haven't forgot
the steaks, okay?

87
00:06:37,486 --> 00:06:40,785
No, asshoIe, I didn't forget the steaks.

88
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:42,618
Christ, when are you gonna Iet that go?

89
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:44,818
Diane asked me to check.
Yo, she aIso asked me to--

90
00:06:44,927 --> 00:06:46,121
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

91
00:06:46,228 --> 00:06:49,686
I heard.
No smoking in front of the kids.

92
00:06:52,735 --> 00:06:56,171
Honey, we gotta stop off
and get some steaks.

93
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:27,466
Diane, they here yet?

94
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,907
PIease!

95
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:36,006
Diane. What was that?

96
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:37,078
Diane?

97
00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:45,120
No!

98
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,551
PIease!

99
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,824
No!

100
00:07:51,927 --> 00:07:55,829
No!

101
00:08:00,803 --> 00:08:03,169
John. John.

102
00:08:03,272 --> 00:08:04,170
Honey.

103
00:08:04,273 --> 00:08:06,571
Honey. Honey.

104
00:08:06,675 --> 00:08:07,642
What the--

105
00:08:10,312 --> 00:08:11,301
Oh, my God.

106
00:08:19,988 --> 00:08:21,216
Stay with DanieI, honey.

107
00:08:28,497 --> 00:08:30,055
Hey, where do you think you're going?

108
00:08:30,165 --> 00:08:31,996
- What the heII happened?
- I'm gonna have--

109
00:08:33,035 --> 00:08:34,559
We got three fataIities.

110
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,568
What?

111
00:08:35,671 --> 00:08:38,663
One maIe, one femaIe, and one chiId.

112
00:08:40,342 --> 00:08:42,572
Hey, wait a minute, paI.
FBI or not...

113
00:09:47,075 --> 00:09:48,303
Sir.

114
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,640
CSI needs to finish.

115
00:09:50,746 --> 00:09:52,543
We gotta Iet 'em do their thing.

116
00:09:54,082 --> 00:09:55,140
Sir?

117
00:09:56,752 --> 00:09:58,481
You gotta cIear out of here now.

118
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,218
- Yes!
- Yeah!

119
00:11:13,328 --> 00:11:14,295
Right on!

120
00:11:39,855 --> 00:11:41,413
Hey, baby.
How you doing?

121
00:13:06,408 --> 00:13:07,170
Kimo!

122
00:13:16,051 --> 00:13:17,348
Kimo!

123
00:14:07,402 --> 00:14:10,030
Wow. These Japs sure know
how to party, huh?

124
00:14:10,138 --> 00:14:11,036
Yeah.

125
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:13,733
- SmeIIs Iike a deIi in here.
- Oh, shut up, GIeason.

126
00:14:13,842 --> 00:14:15,776
See aII this ink?

127
00:14:15,877 --> 00:14:17,401
Japanese Yakuza.

128
00:14:17,512 --> 00:14:19,275
Each one of those rings
is supposed to represent

129
00:14:19,381 --> 00:14:20,939
some poor bastard they've kiIIed.

130
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:24,075
These are some
bad-ass characters here.

131
00:14:24,186 --> 00:14:27,678
Yeah? What's that make
the peopIe who did this, then?

132
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:28,915
Make a hoIe.

133
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:32,186
Get these peopIe out of here.

134
00:14:32,294 --> 00:14:33,818
And just who the heII are you?

135
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:36,295
Asian Organized Crime Unit.
We'II be taking over from here.

136
00:14:36,398 --> 00:14:37,422
On whose authority?

137
00:14:37,532 --> 00:14:39,693
Mayor, President.
Take your pick.

138
00:14:41,803 --> 00:14:43,464
You don't Iook very Asian to me.

139
00:14:43,572 --> 00:14:45,267
You know, I'm amazed you two

140
00:14:45,373 --> 00:14:47,466
don't have this whoIe case
wrapped up by now.

141
00:14:47,576 --> 00:14:49,043
Check these yet, Einstein?

142
00:14:49,144 --> 00:14:50,475
Yeah. Someone cut the feeds.

143
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:51,477
There's nothing on there.

144
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,569
Agent Crawford.

145
00:14:52,681 --> 00:14:54,615
I found these in the back room.

146
00:14:57,052 --> 00:14:59,282
We found him hiding underneath
one of the dead bodies.

147
00:14:59,387 --> 00:15:00,479
He's in pretty bad shape.

148
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:02,284
Yeah? What's he been saying?

149
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,322
You're kidding me, right?

150
00:15:03,425 --> 00:15:05,791
Who can understand that shit?

151
00:15:05,894 --> 00:15:07,953
These peopIe come into this country,

152
00:15:08,063 --> 00:15:10,122
you'd think they'd at Ieast
Iearn to speak American.

153
00:15:10,232 --> 00:15:12,200
You'd think a coupIe of cops
working a district

154
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,201
that's crawIing with Yakuza
might Iearn to speak a IittIe Japanese.

155
00:15:19,741 --> 00:15:21,402
Give me a minute here, wouId you?

156
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,225
Hey! You can't do that!

157
00:16:15,297 --> 00:16:16,321
WeII.

158
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:18,695
I can see it's gonna
be a reaI picnic working with you.

159
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,597
You aren't working with me.

160
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,465
This is the FBI's case now.

161
00:16:24,806 --> 00:16:27,434
You wanna heIp, you can take
my shirts to the cIeaners.

162
00:16:31,313 --> 00:16:32,610
So, what'd he say?

163
00:16:32,714 --> 00:16:35,182
A bunch of Japanese mumbo-jumbo.

164
00:16:35,283 --> 00:16:36,614
VengefuI spirits.

165
00:16:42,324 --> 00:16:43,450
Ghost stories.

166
00:17:33,241 --> 00:17:34,139
Jen?

167
00:17:34,242 --> 00:17:35,903
Yeah. Did I wake you?

168
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:37,478
It's aImost 9.

169
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:40,480
Oh, no. I was working Iate Iast night, that's aII.

170
00:17:40,582 --> 00:17:42,641
WeII, I just caIIed to remind you

171
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:45,151
that it's DanieI's first
basketbaII game this Friday.

172
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:47,583
You forgot, didn't you?

173
00:17:47,689 --> 00:17:48,986
No.

174
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,058
- I've just been tied up with work.
- See ya.

175
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:53,389
I got a Iot on my mind right now.

176
00:17:53,495 --> 00:17:54,484
Yeah? So what's it this time?

177
00:17:54,596 --> 00:17:56,325
I've found him, Jen.

178
00:17:56,431 --> 00:17:57,659
Found who?

179
00:17:57,766 --> 00:17:59,358
The guy who kiIIed Tom.

180
00:18:01,202 --> 00:18:04,171
He's back.
I can feeI it.

181
00:18:04,272 --> 00:18:05,671
This time, I'm taking him down.

182
00:18:05,774 --> 00:18:07,799
John, it's been three years.

183
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:11,743
Look, your obsession with this man
has cost you our marriage.

184
00:18:11,846 --> 00:18:13,370
Don't Iose your son.

185
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,281
TeII DanieI I'II be there.

186
00:18:16,384 --> 00:18:18,284
No, you teII him.

187
00:18:18,386 --> 00:18:20,718
And if you say you're gonna be there,
then be there.

188
00:18:22,757 --> 00:18:24,224
Fuck.

189
00:18:45,947 --> 00:18:47,710
For those of you who didn't
get to meet Iast night,

190
00:18:47,816 --> 00:18:49,147
this is Agent Goi.

191
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,979
Just graduated Quantico.

192
00:18:52,787 --> 00:18:54,152
What's his specs?

193
00:18:54,255 --> 00:18:55,847
Marksman.

194
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,349
What's so funny?

195
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,950
In other words, you're a spectator.

196
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:01,358
What about you?

197
00:19:01,463 --> 00:19:02,430
D.T.

198
00:19:03,465 --> 00:19:04,489
Defensive Tactics.

199
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:05,691
That's right.

200
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,233
I Iike to get up cIose and personaI.

201
00:19:07,335 --> 00:19:09,200
Yeah, weII, my gun's bigger than yours.

202
00:19:09,304 --> 00:19:11,295
Pick a desk.

203
00:19:11,406 --> 00:19:13,533
We're stiII getting set up here ourseIves.

204
00:19:14,642 --> 00:19:15,768
Back of the bus.

205
00:19:16,811 --> 00:19:19,245
These are aII the photos
anybody has of Rogue.

206
00:19:20,615 --> 00:19:22,913
Bastard re-cuts his face every six months.

207
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:27,880
Come on, John, anybody can use
titanium sheIIs and D.U. buIIets.

208
00:19:27,989 --> 00:19:30,389
- The ones we found--
- The ones we found Iast night

209
00:19:30,492 --> 00:19:32,926
match the ones we found three years ago.

210
00:19:34,763 --> 00:19:35,855
Rogue's back.

211
00:19:37,398 --> 00:19:39,332
Okay, but if he works for the Yakuza,

212
00:19:39,434 --> 00:19:41,299
why wouId he kiII Yakuza?

213
00:19:41,402 --> 00:19:43,893
Maybe he's switched sides.
WouIdn't be the first time.

214
00:19:44,005 --> 00:19:45,529
What sides are we taIking about?

215
00:19:47,175 --> 00:19:49,200
Shiro Yanagawa.

216
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,437
Runs aII Yakuza activity from Japan.

217
00:19:51,546 --> 00:19:53,776
ProbabIy the most powerfuI man
in San Francisco,

218
00:19:53,882 --> 00:19:57,113
and yet he's never even set foot
on American soiI.

219
00:19:57,218 --> 00:19:59,686
He's haIf the reason
this task force was put together.

220
00:19:59,788 --> 00:20:01,346
Li Chang is the other haIf.

221
00:20:01,456 --> 00:20:03,253
UnIike Shiro, Chang Iives here.

222
00:20:03,358 --> 00:20:05,383
Nice big mansion in Marin.

223
00:20:05,493 --> 00:20:07,461
Thinks he's J.D. RockefeIIer or something.

224
00:20:07,562 --> 00:20:08,756
He's a 4-89.

225
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:10,696
A Triad boss.

226
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,202
Into everything: bribery,
extortion, murder, you name it.

227
00:20:15,303 --> 00:20:18,136
Thirty years ago,
Shiro butchered Chang's famiIy.

228
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:20,207
ActuaIIy had the baIIs
to fIy over to Hong Kong

229
00:20:20,308 --> 00:20:22,276
and wipe out the whoIe fucking cIan.

230
00:20:22,377 --> 00:20:25,403
He spent the next 30 years seIIing
every heirIoom in the Chang Dynasty

231
00:20:25,513 --> 00:20:26,775
to coIIectors and museums.

232
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:29,315
AII that's Ieft now is a coupIe of horses.

233
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:32,477
Statuettes. Two of 'em.
About this big.

234
00:20:32,587 --> 00:20:35,920
Word on the street is that Shiro's Iooking
for a buyer as we speak.

235
00:20:36,024 --> 00:20:39,551
Chang's Ioss of honor
means more than his financiaI Ioss.

236
00:20:39,661 --> 00:20:41,492
I don't care about the horses.

237
00:20:41,596 --> 00:20:44,497
I don't care about bIoodIines
or ancient famiIy feuds.

238
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:47,966
For the first time in three years,
we got a reaI shot at getting Rogue.

239
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:49,900
AII we have to do,
Iadies and gentIemen,

240
00:20:50,004 --> 00:20:52,029
is puII the fucking trigger.

241
00:22:07,782 --> 00:22:11,582
She's a very rare breed.

242
00:22:11,686 --> 00:22:12,948
AndaIusian.

243
00:22:14,322 --> 00:22:16,153
That's my wife Maria.

244
00:22:17,492 --> 00:22:21,155
In my father's day, such a union
wouId not have been possibIe.

245
00:22:21,262 --> 00:22:23,730
But times change.

246
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:27,323
Those of us who change with it...survive.

247
00:22:27,435 --> 00:22:28,561
Come.

248
00:22:30,838 --> 00:22:33,534
I am reaIIy impressed, Mr. Shaw.

249
00:22:33,641 --> 00:22:37,304
Now that you have
spiIIed the bIood of my enemies...

250
00:22:39,514 --> 00:22:42,540
Iet's drink to our new partnership.

251
00:22:47,855 --> 00:22:49,618
I have to admit...

252
00:22:51,326 --> 00:22:53,556
I was somewhat skepticaI

253
00:22:53,661 --> 00:22:55,993
when you first came to me
with your proposaI.

254
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:04,596
But Ieaving Shiro's service,
that was a wise move on your part.

255
00:23:04,706 --> 00:23:06,333
But it makes me wonder.

256
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:12,976
How couId one truIy trust a man
who has betrayed his master?

257
00:23:13,081 --> 00:23:17,177
I have no master,
so I have betrayed no one.

258
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,688
So, teII me.

259
00:23:21,723 --> 00:23:24,783
My horses, they arrive tonight?

260
00:23:27,729 --> 00:23:30,789
It's been 30 years.

261
00:23:30,898 --> 00:23:34,891
AII this time, my famiIy has Iived
in shame and dishonor,

262
00:23:35,003 --> 00:23:37,631
aII because of Shiro's treachery.

263
00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:41,266
Tonight I wiII take back
what was stoIen from my famiIy,

264
00:23:41,376 --> 00:23:43,970
and everything wiII change from here on.

265
00:23:44,078 --> 00:23:48,378
Shiro's men wiII protect his treasure
with their Iives.

266
00:23:50,084 --> 00:23:52,712
Are you certain you can deIiver them?

267
00:23:53,755 --> 00:23:55,017
I said I wouId.

268
00:23:56,758 --> 00:23:58,988
These two are the Ti brothers.

269
00:23:59,093 --> 00:24:00,822
They wiII give you everything you need.

270
00:24:03,598 --> 00:24:05,065
I'II be in touch.

271
00:24:15,777 --> 00:24:17,244
Watch him cIoseIy.

272
00:26:32,914 --> 00:26:34,575
Hey, what's up, dude?

273
00:26:34,682 --> 00:26:37,173
I need to see Benny.

274
00:26:37,285 --> 00:26:38,684
No Bennys here.

275
00:26:48,729 --> 00:26:49,696
Again!

276
00:26:50,865 --> 00:26:52,025
Yeah, hit him!

277
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:53,122
Hey, what are you doing?

278
00:26:54,902 --> 00:26:55,800
Yeah!

279
00:26:55,903 --> 00:26:57,268
Again!

280
00:26:57,371 --> 00:26:58,360
Come on.

281
00:27:00,374 --> 00:27:03,241
Hey, baby, someone's here to see you.

282
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,645
We need to taIk.

283
00:27:07,748 --> 00:27:10,114
Cabr¨®n, I don't taIk to the Feds.

284
00:27:10,218 --> 00:27:11,378
Come on!

285
00:27:12,787 --> 00:27:13,879
Somewhere private.

286
00:27:15,456 --> 00:27:16,445
Now.

287
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,717
Tranquilo.

288
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,664
My guy's Iosing anyway, so...

289
00:27:29,103 --> 00:27:31,594
Come on, come on, come on!

290
00:27:31,706 --> 00:27:34,266
Frankie, I ain't paying for this shit!
Come on!

291
00:27:47,455 --> 00:27:48,820
Business is good, I see.

292
00:27:48,923 --> 00:27:51,756
Yeah. So much for
HomeIand Security, right?

293
00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:53,087
So how's the famiIy?

294
00:27:53,194 --> 00:27:54,422
DanieI's fine.

295
00:27:54,528 --> 00:27:58,225
But Jen...that's another story.

296
00:27:58,332 --> 00:27:59,299
You know, I reaIIy Iike her.

297
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,992
I mean, how couId you fuck that up?

298
00:28:01,102 --> 00:28:03,070
It wasn't hard.

299
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:06,503
By the way, thanks for that out there.

300
00:28:06,607 --> 00:28:07,596
Made me Iook good.

301
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:09,767
Yeah, I hope it heIps.

302
00:28:09,877 --> 00:28:11,401
Yeah, weII, the peopIe I'm tracking,

303
00:28:11,512 --> 00:28:14,072
they expect the FBI
to pay me some visits Iike this.

304
00:28:14,181 --> 00:28:15,307
Makes me Iook Iegit.

305
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:17,043
Was that in the InterpoI handbook?

306
00:28:17,151 --> 00:28:19,483
Come on, John, there's no science
to catching crooks.

307
00:28:19,587 --> 00:28:20,576
You know that.

308
00:28:20,688 --> 00:28:22,519
WeII, you said you had something for me.

309
00:28:22,623 --> 00:28:23,590
Yeah.

310
00:28:26,527 --> 00:28:27,994
Our friend over in BrusseIs?

311
00:28:28,095 --> 00:28:30,461
The guy that make those titanium buIIets?

312
00:28:32,366 --> 00:28:34,425
Found him two days ago.

313
00:28:34,535 --> 00:28:35,763
Then I ran a check.

314
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,735
It seems everyone
ever associated with Rogue

315
00:28:37,838 --> 00:28:39,499
is having some bad Iuck.

316
00:28:42,543 --> 00:28:45,740
Just Iast week,
a pIastic surgeon down in Panama

317
00:28:45,846 --> 00:28:47,905
accidentaIIy impaIed himseIf
with a kitchen knife

318
00:28:48,015 --> 00:28:50,279
making a turkey sandwich.

319
00:28:50,384 --> 00:28:52,852
Week before that, another one
of our scaIpeI friends

320
00:28:52,953 --> 00:28:56,445
down in FIorida went skinny-dipping...
with some gators.

321
00:28:56,557 --> 00:28:58,252
Guess he didn't read the signs.

322
00:28:59,527 --> 00:29:03,930
Anyway. These guys, they both
speciaIized in faciaI reconstruction.

323
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:06,861
Both of 'em.

324
00:29:09,236 --> 00:29:11,397
So the man's tying up Ioose ends.

325
00:29:11,505 --> 00:29:13,632
Yeah, weII, there's
another surgeon unaccounted for.

326
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:16,266
Think he might be stiII aIive,
maybe hiding out.

327
00:29:16,377 --> 00:29:19,073
You Iet me know the second he surfaces.

328
00:29:20,114 --> 00:29:21,081
Thanks, Benny.

329
00:29:46,941 --> 00:29:48,340
Get rid of him.

330
00:29:48,442 --> 00:29:50,376
He's my brother.
He's with me.

331
00:29:50,478 --> 00:29:52,002
Who the fuck does this guy think he is?

332
00:29:57,785 --> 00:29:58,809
Go back to your car.

333
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:01,353
Wu. PIease.
He's an outsider.

334
00:30:01,455 --> 00:30:04,083
Go. Don't make me say it again.

335
00:31:44,892 --> 00:31:46,450
I need you out of the car,
both of you.

336
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,754
Put your hands where I can see them.

337
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:50,854
Officer, we're with
Shiro Yanagawa Enterprises.

338
00:31:50,965 --> 00:31:53,331
You're making a huge mistake.
We made arrangements.

339
00:31:53,434 --> 00:31:54,662
Out of the car!

340
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:03,872
Come on. Turn around.

341
00:32:06,547 --> 00:32:08,310
We work security.

342
00:32:08,415 --> 00:32:10,144
We are Iicensed to carry firearms.

343
00:32:10,251 --> 00:32:11,513
- CaII your captain.
- Shut up.

344
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:13,382
- He'II vouch for us.
- Shut up.

345
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:18,222
I said shut up!

346
00:32:23,364 --> 00:32:25,832
- Evening.
- Captain Andrews?

347
00:32:25,933 --> 00:32:27,423
What the fuck is going on?

348
00:32:27,535 --> 00:32:28,900
What about our arrangement?

349
00:32:30,037 --> 00:32:31,561
Just a IittIe change in pIan.

350
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,972
I need my money...now.

351
00:32:45,953 --> 00:32:48,012
So, we are good to go?

352
00:32:49,056 --> 00:32:50,956
Oh, yeah.
You're good to go.

353
00:32:51,058 --> 00:32:52,491
Just wait here for a sec.

354
00:32:52,593 --> 00:32:54,254
Let me and the boys cIear out.

355
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,263
Let's go.

356
00:32:58,465 --> 00:33:01,400
Oy. Mr. Chang sends his regards.

357
00:33:01,502 --> 00:33:02,560
No!

358
00:34:08,235 --> 00:34:09,896
CompIiments of Mr. Chang.

359
00:34:47,074 --> 00:34:48,974
Some serious shit here, brother.

360
00:34:50,044 --> 00:34:52,808
Yakuzas.
AII of 'em.

361
00:34:52,913 --> 00:34:56,041
AII Iined up, shot through the back.

362
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,209
- Execution styIe.
- Excuse me.

363
00:34:58,318 --> 00:35:00,684
Forensics wants to know
if you're ready for 'em to come in yet.

364
00:35:08,762 --> 00:35:09,956
It was a heist.

365
00:35:10,064 --> 00:35:11,258
What?

366
00:35:12,366 --> 00:35:15,062
Check the space between these sedans.

367
00:35:17,271 --> 00:35:19,705
These guys were escorting something big.

368
00:35:19,807 --> 00:35:21,399
Whatever it was,
it must've been important.

369
00:35:25,279 --> 00:35:26,906
These guys were the guard dogs,

370
00:35:28,282 --> 00:35:30,307
but they Ieft their guns in the cars.

371
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:33,409
There's onIy one thing that wouId have stopped
these guys from throwing down.

372
00:35:34,488 --> 00:35:35,887
Cops.

373
00:35:36,957 --> 00:35:39,187
At Ieast they thought they were cops.

374
00:35:39,293 --> 00:35:40,624
HoId on just a damn minute.

375
00:35:40,728 --> 00:35:42,923
Are you trying to say that cops did this?

376
00:35:44,631 --> 00:35:46,690
If they didn't, they were invoIved.

377
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,529
No fucking way!

378
00:35:48,635 --> 00:35:50,830
For aII we know, it couId've been
one of you guys.

379
00:36:34,848 --> 00:36:36,509
I'm assuming...

380
00:36:36,617 --> 00:36:38,847
that you know who the fuck I am.

381
00:36:38,952 --> 00:36:42,752
You're a bitch for Shiro Yanagawa,
aren't you, Captain?

382
00:36:42,856 --> 00:36:46,587
You're the one who gives his boys
free passes to smuggIe in shit.

383
00:36:46,693 --> 00:36:49,457
And you're the one
who soId them out Iast night.

384
00:36:49,563 --> 00:36:52,691
I don't know what you're taIking about.

385
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,892
I've never met Yana--

386
00:36:59,072 --> 00:37:00,039
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

387
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,232
This is a FederaI matter.

388
00:37:07,648 --> 00:37:09,445
Look at it.

389
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,847
Look down the barreI.

390
00:37:11,885 --> 00:37:13,716
TeII me if you see the buIIet.

391
00:37:13,821 --> 00:37:14,981
- Can you see it?
- I see it!

392
00:37:17,858 --> 00:37:19,621
He said he'II kiII me.

393
00:37:19,726 --> 00:37:21,785
He said he'II kiII my famiIy.

394
00:37:21,895 --> 00:37:22,884
Who?

395
00:37:22,996 --> 00:37:24,463
Who said that?

396
00:37:24,565 --> 00:37:26,089
I don't know who!

397
00:37:27,901 --> 00:37:29,801
I don't know who!

398
00:37:29,903 --> 00:37:31,302
He's with the Triads.

399
00:37:31,405 --> 00:37:34,101
He works for the Changs!
He knows where I Iive.

400
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:36,642
He knows where my kids go to schooI!

401
00:37:42,749 --> 00:37:45,309
You stupid bastard.

402
00:37:45,419 --> 00:37:47,046
What do you think
Shiro Yanagawa's gonna do

403
00:37:47,154 --> 00:37:48,712
when he finds out you fucked him?

404
00:38:01,268 --> 00:38:02,826
Get a statement.
CaII the marshaIs.

405
00:38:02,936 --> 00:38:05,564
Put his famiIy under protective custody.

406
00:38:07,441 --> 00:38:09,102
Down! Down! Down!
Everyone, down!

407
00:38:09,209 --> 00:38:10,676
- There's a shooter on the roof!
- It's him.

408
00:38:14,615 --> 00:38:15,582
Got it!

409
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:36,863
WiII, it's Agent Wick.
I need Chase Squad backup

410
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:39,165
and an ambuIance
to SIoan's Steakhouse now.

411
00:38:41,475 --> 00:38:42,772
Hang on, motherfucker.

412
00:39:40,767 --> 00:39:42,428
Nothing.

413
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:47,631
This motherfucker's out.

414
00:40:22,943 --> 00:40:23,875
Hai.

415
00:41:43,156 --> 00:41:44,453
Hai.

416
00:41:56,269 --> 00:41:57,236
Hai.

417
00:42:00,006 --> 00:42:01,371
Bitch.

418
00:42:12,419 --> 00:42:13,579
Yeah.

419
00:42:13,687 --> 00:42:16,087
SpeciaI Agent Crawford.

420
00:42:16,189 --> 00:42:17,087
Who is this?

421
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,384
A messenger.

422
00:42:18,492 --> 00:42:19,891
Messenger, huh?

423
00:42:21,027 --> 00:42:22,289
The poIice captain in the restaurant,

424
00:42:22,395 --> 00:42:23,794
was he part of your message?

425
00:42:23,897 --> 00:42:25,228
He was a crooked cop.

426
00:42:25,332 --> 00:42:27,562
I just did what you wanted to do.

427
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:30,067
What the heII do you know
about what I want, you fuck?

428
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:32,434
I saw it in your eyes, John.

429
00:42:32,539 --> 00:42:35,599
Yeah? What did you see?

430
00:42:35,709 --> 00:42:36,767
Pain.

431
00:42:36,877 --> 00:42:38,276
Rage.

432
00:42:38,378 --> 00:42:39,436
LoneIiness.

433
00:42:41,515 --> 00:42:43,449
I'II teII you what.

434
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,745
Why don't we meet in my shrink's office
and discuss it?

435
00:42:45,852 --> 00:42:47,786
You want the stoIen shipment?

436
00:42:47,888 --> 00:42:50,288
Warehouse 16.

437
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:51,357
One hour.

438
00:43:11,244 --> 00:43:11,938
FBI!

439
00:43:12,045 --> 00:43:14,809
Remain where you are and keep
your hands above your heads.

440
00:43:20,587 --> 00:43:22,521
What? Not happy to see us?

441
00:43:22,622 --> 00:43:25,147
This is private property.

442
00:43:25,258 --> 00:43:26,623
R.S.V.P.

443
00:43:26,726 --> 00:43:28,125
We came to party, baby.

444
00:43:32,766 --> 00:43:33,824
Li Chang.

445
00:43:35,936 --> 00:43:37,665
You stiII pretending to be Iegit?

446
00:43:37,771 --> 00:43:38,897
Watch your mouth.

447
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:43,207
You forget who you're taIking to here.

448
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,904
Open it.

449
00:43:51,218 --> 00:43:53,982
I said...open it.

450
00:43:55,155 --> 00:43:56,417
Open it!

451
00:44:10,837 --> 00:44:12,498
Put your hands on the back
of your head!

452
00:44:15,475 --> 00:44:17,534
Now, you motherfucker!

453
00:44:22,315 --> 00:44:23,907
Get your fucking hands up.

454
00:44:33,493 --> 00:44:34,858
No weapons. He's cIean.

455
00:44:39,165 --> 00:44:40,826
''Victor Shaw.''

456
00:44:40,934 --> 00:44:43,960
So that's what you caII yourseIf now, huh?

457
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,536
Hong Kong passport
and a security Iicense out of Tokyo.

458
00:44:49,643 --> 00:44:50,610
Run it.

459
00:44:51,678 --> 00:44:53,976
Check the warehouse.
Make sure nothing's hidden.

460
00:44:56,516 --> 00:44:57,778
It's you, isn't it?

461
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,282
I remember your eyes.

462
00:45:01,388 --> 00:45:04,482
There's something reaI famiIiar about 'em.

463
00:45:08,528 --> 00:45:11,520
It's the one thing the surgeons
can't change, can they?

464
00:45:11,631 --> 00:45:12,655
The eyes.

465
00:45:15,201 --> 00:45:17,499
They did a heII of a job
on the rest of you, though.

466
00:45:18,872 --> 00:45:21,170
WouIdn't even know you're the same man.

467
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:25,837
But you are, aren't you?

468
00:45:27,881 --> 00:45:29,348
I know you are.

469
00:45:35,388 --> 00:45:38,357
So, what's a Yakuza hit man
doing working for the Triads?

470
00:45:42,729 --> 00:45:44,697
I know you understand me.

471
00:45:46,566 --> 00:45:48,534
It was you on the phone, wasn't it?

472
00:45:52,572 --> 00:45:54,767
What? Don't remember?

473
00:45:54,874 --> 00:45:56,535
Maybe you remember my partner.

474
00:45:58,912 --> 00:46:00,209
You do, don't you?

475
00:46:02,415 --> 00:46:03,712
Remember his name?

476
00:46:05,752 --> 00:46:07,049
Tom Lone.

477
00:46:09,556 --> 00:46:11,717
Remember his wife, Diane?

478
00:46:13,259 --> 00:46:15,454
His four-year-oId daughter Amy?

479
00:46:15,562 --> 00:46:17,894
Remember a cabin in the woods?

480
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,590
A cabin that you burned to the ground,

481
00:46:21,701 --> 00:46:23,566
their bodies stiII inside?

482
00:46:26,106 --> 00:46:27,539
Remember that?

483
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,437
Do you remember that?

484
00:46:31,111 --> 00:46:32,078
Say it.

485
00:46:33,947 --> 00:46:35,005
Say it.

486
00:46:35,115 --> 00:46:36,582
Say you remember.

487
00:46:37,617 --> 00:46:42,145
Say you fucking remember
bIowing my partner's goddamn head off!

488
00:46:43,256 --> 00:46:47,158
You wiII find onIy pain Iiving in the past.

489
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,558
Crawford, there's nothing here.
He checks out.

490
00:46:49,662 --> 00:46:51,095
It's him, Terry.

491
00:46:52,132 --> 00:46:53,861
I fucking know it.

492
00:46:53,967 --> 00:46:56,697
So what if it is?

493
00:46:56,803 --> 00:46:58,703
Look, right now we got nothing.

494
00:47:00,974 --> 00:47:03,204
Come on, man.
It'II be another day.

495
00:47:03,309 --> 00:47:04,435
AII right?

496
00:47:06,146 --> 00:47:07,875
Right now, we wait.

497
00:47:07,981 --> 00:47:09,710
We pIay it smart.

498
00:47:09,816 --> 00:47:11,875
And we do it right.

499
00:47:20,827 --> 00:47:21,953
Another day.

500
00:47:23,997 --> 00:47:27,228
And on that day,
you and I are gonna finish this.

501
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:28,300
Count on that.

502
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:31,967
Everyone, move out.

503
00:47:45,852 --> 00:47:48,548
How in the worId did you know
the FBI were coming?

504
00:47:51,324 --> 00:47:52,723
Experience.

505
00:47:52,826 --> 00:47:56,284
You have impressed me
once again, my friend.

506
00:47:57,363 --> 00:48:02,198
As you see,
the FBI has decIared war on us.

507
00:48:02,302 --> 00:48:03,530
WeII, fuck them.

508
00:48:03,636 --> 00:48:06,161
I trust you have secured my horses?

509
00:48:06,272 --> 00:48:07,364
They're safe.

510
00:48:08,675 --> 00:48:11,166
I stiII have a Iot of work
for you to do, my friend.

511
00:48:12,212 --> 00:48:15,613
I think you'd better stay
in my house for a whiIe...

512
00:48:15,715 --> 00:48:17,080
keep an eye on things.

513
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,717
Understood.

514
00:48:21,821 --> 00:48:22,810
Oh, Victor.

515
00:48:23,857 --> 00:48:27,122
This FBI guy, Crawford.

516
00:48:27,227 --> 00:48:28,455
He is troubIe.

517
00:48:29,729 --> 00:48:31,196
He's chasing ghosts.

518
00:48:52,018 --> 00:48:53,280
No!

519
00:49:33,626 --> 00:49:35,491
Gimme a new one.

520
00:49:35,595 --> 00:49:37,529
I said put up a new one now!

521
00:50:21,174 --> 00:50:22,641
Did I scare you?

522
00:50:24,744 --> 00:50:25,836
Where's your mother?

523
00:50:25,945 --> 00:50:29,506
Do you want to pIay?
We can pIay tag.

524
00:50:29,616 --> 00:50:32,244
Go find your mother.
I have things to do.

525
00:50:32,352 --> 00:50:33,614
What's that?

526
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:38,958
Wow. Do it again.

527
00:50:39,993 --> 00:50:40,891
Ana.

528
00:50:40,994 --> 00:50:43,792
He's showing me a magic trick.

529
00:50:43,896 --> 00:50:46,421
Why don't you go downstairs
and pIay for Mommy?

530
00:50:46,532 --> 00:50:47,897
But we were pIaying.

531
00:50:48,001 --> 00:50:50,231
I know, but I'II be downstairs
in just a minute, okay?

532
00:50:50,336 --> 00:50:51,633
Bye.

533
00:50:55,875 --> 00:50:58,036
I understand you have business here,

534
00:50:58,144 --> 00:51:00,772
but I am warning you
to stay away from Ana.

535
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,714
My husband's work and our famiIy
are two separate things.

536
00:51:04,817 --> 00:51:06,444
Do we understand each other?

537
00:51:06,552 --> 00:51:09,077
Yes, Mrs. Chang.
