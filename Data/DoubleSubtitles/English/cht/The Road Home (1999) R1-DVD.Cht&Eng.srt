1
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:50,540
我 的 父 親 母 親
本片改編自鮑十所著小說「紀念」

2
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,660
父親突然去世了
My father died suddenly.

3
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,160
我是昨天晚上知道的
I only found out last night.

4
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,660
村長給我打了一個長途電話
The mayor called to tell me.

5
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,680
當時我真不敢相信
I couldn't believe it.

6
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,170
我的家在山區  一個不大的村子
My hometown is in the mountains...

7
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,170
叫三合屯
a village called Sanhetun.

8
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,680
我很早就離開家鄉出來工作了
I left to work in the city.

9
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,180
因為忙  幾年都回不了一次家
I'm so busy I haven't been home in years.

10
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,680
父親是村裏的小學老師
My father was the village schoolteacher.

11
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,190
在當地教了一輩子書
He taught there all his life.

12
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,690
我是父母唯一的孩子
I am an only child.

13
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,690
也是村裏唯一念過大學的
The only one from our village who went to college.

14
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,700
我現在最擔心的就是母親  怕她一下子受不了
I am very worried about my mother.

15
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,240
師傅  進屋喝口水歇會兒吧
Come in and rest a while.

16
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,240
不了  我還要趕緊回去呢
I've got to get back.

17
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,240
那回去跟你們老總說  回頭我當面謝他
Thank your boss again for me.

18
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,240
- 不客氣    - 謝謝啊
- Thank you.    - Goodbye.

19
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,760
媽
Mother?

20
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,760
媽
Mother?

21
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,760
生子
Yusheng.

22
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,770
村長  夏大叔
Mayor, Uncle Xia.

23
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,770
在外頭看見車  才知道你回來了
I saw the car and knew you were back.

24
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,770
那進屋吧
Come in.

25
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,770
屋裏暖和
It's warmer inside.

26
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,360
你也坐  坐吧
Please. Sit down.

27
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,290
給你去個電話  說情況也沒說清楚
I couldn't tell you much over the phone.

28
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,360
這次你回來呀  給你說一說
Now you're here, I can explain everything.

29
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,290
咱村裏這個學校啊
It's the schoolhouse.

30
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,300
你爸是早就要求要翻蓋  多少年了吧
For many years your father has wanted to rebuild it,

31
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,300
因為村裏困難  也沒答應
but there were always reasons we couldn't.

32
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,800
現在你爸又張羅要翻蓋學校
He brought it up again recently,

33
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,800
村裏這回就決定要翻蓋學校
and the village agreed.

34
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,810
可是木料都預備夠了  還缺錢
We have the materials we need but not enough money.

35
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,810
沒錢他就急了
Your father's mind was set.

36
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,850
他著急啊  他就趕著出去借
He was determined to find the money.

37
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,810
關於你爸借錢  可跑了多少趟
He began traveling around, trying to borrow the money.

38
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,820
這兒  那兒  凡是他不錯的
He went all over the county.

39
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,830
有詞兒的人
If he thought there was a chance,

40
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,320
他都張羅去借去
he'd go after it.

41
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,330
結果呢  這趟回來
On the last trip, on his way home...

42
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,830
在路中就給趕上了風雪  特別大
he ran into a snowstorm, a big blizzard.

43
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,830
就給激了  激病了
He was stuck in the storm, and he got sick.

44
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,830
這兩天白毛風
He was too sick to be moved.

45
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
激病了
That made him more anxious.

46
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,340
激病了回來一看不行了
He was in bad shape when he got back,

47
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,840
這就送到縣城醫院經過了看
so we took him to the hospital.

48
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,840
這一看啊  是心臟病
They examined him, said he had a heart problem.

49
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,850
咱們你說老哥在這兒多少年
We've known your dad all these years.

50
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,850
不知道他有心臟病  結果呢  是心臟病
Who knew he had a heart condition?

51
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,850
治療了  看了不行
They tried treating him, but it was no use.

52
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,360
這就結果呢  你爸也就不頂了
He fought, but he didn't make it.

53
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,360
我爸在哪兒呢
Where is my father now?

54
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,860
現在在縣醫院呢  在太平房
At the provincial hospital, in the morgue.

55
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,860
這不就等著你回來
That's why we wanted you to return.

56
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,380
跟你商量
To tell you all this.

57
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,870
上次通電話的時候還挺好  咋整的呢
Last time I spoke with him, he seemed fine.

58
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,380
就是年紀大了  再趕上風雪
It was a bad storm.

59
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,380
人上歲數  再趕上這大雪天  大白毛風
At his age, it was too much for him.

60
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,880
這一激  受不了啦
It would have been

61
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,390
人是不頂了
hard on anyone.

62
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,190
我們村的意思呢  是打算明天待一天
The village wants to arrange a car

63
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,890
後天咱們用車給他接回來
to bring your father back.

64
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,900
- 已經三天了    - 在咱們村給他安葬就得了
- It's been three days.    - Bring him back here to bury him.

65
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,400
大概就這個意思
That's what we planned.

66
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,400
那就按村長的意思辦吧  我沒啥意見
That's fine. Go ahead.

67
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,910
沒啥意見  還有一個問題
But there is a problem.

68
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:14,410
這問題就是你媽不同意拿車拉
Your mother doesn't want to use a car.

69
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,420
她要求是抬回來
She wants your father to be carried back.

70
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,920
抬是啥意思啊
What do you mean?

71
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:24,420
抬就是  按老迷信說就是  再返回來走走老路
She wants the coffin brought back on foot...

72
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,930
回來看看這個老路  就是別忘這個老路吧
so your father won't forget his way home.

73
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,430
- 這是老一套迷信    - 那我媽是這麼想的嗎
- It's an old tradition, a superstition.    - I see.

74
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,930
她還想陪著也走回來跟著
And she wants to walk with us.

75
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,930
那就抬
So let's do it.

76
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,440
抬呢  咱們村裏也同意
We want to.

77
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,440
在這教了多少年學了  要說抬  也沒問題
He was our village teacher. Everyone respects him.

78
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,940
實際上咱們村子裏  現在是年輕人都走光了
But our young people have all left for the city.

79
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,940
都在外面做活
They've gone away to work.

80
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,950
盡剩些老的老小的小
Only old people and children are left.

81
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:53,450
村裏的意思是想用拖拉機
We thought of using a tractor.

82
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,950
半天也就拉回來了
We could make the trip in half a day.

83
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,460
這回讓你回來做做你媽的工作
You must help your mother decide.

84
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,960
行  大爺  你們別為難
I appreciate your concern.

85
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,240
這事兒我跟我媽說說  勸勸她
I will talk it over with her.

86
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,960
- 對    - 唉  我媽呢
- Good.    - Where is she?

87
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:12,640
你爸死了她就上那學校坐著
Probably at the schoolhouse.

88
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,470
一到學校就發呆坐著  誰勸也不行
She's there every day since he died.

89
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,480
- 誰勸也不回來    - 她這一坐就是半天
- She won't listen to anyone.    - She just sits there.

90
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,480
- 沒啥事兒吧    - 沒啥事兒
- Is she okay?    - I think so.

91
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,480
就怕她也
I am only afraid--

92
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,980
是不是以前那學校啊
The old schoolhouse?

93
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,480
就是以前的學校
Yes.

94
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,000
那我過去看看
I'll go to her.

95
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,020
- 媽    - 生兒
- Mother.    - Yusheng.

96
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,020
天這麼冷  咱們回家去吧
It's so cold. Let's go home, okay?

97
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
你爸不在了
Your father is dead.

98
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,540
走  咱們回家  媽
Let's go home.

99
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,040
再也看不著你爸了
You will never see him again.

100
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,560
媽  上炕暖和暖和吧
Get on the bed where it's warm.

101
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,500
生子  你跟我搬織布機去
Yusheng. Bring me my loom.

102
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,570
織布機  搬它幹啥  媽
What for?

103
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,580
我要織布
I want to weave something.

104
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,580
織啥布
Weave what?

105
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,080
我要給你爸織塊擋棺布
A cloth for your father's coffin.

106
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,590
媽  你看這樣行不行
Don't trouble yourself.

107
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,590
咱們別織了  我上供銷社給你買一塊
Why don't we go buy one instead?

108
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,590
買的我不要
I don't want to buy one.

109
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,090
織布機都幾十年了
That loom is so old.

110
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,100
早都壞了  再說現在誰還自己織布呢
It's been broken for years.

111
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,600
壞了  叫你夏大叔修修嘛
Why can't we fix it?

112
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,300
我看  媽
You need rest, Mother.

113
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,610
這兩天你這身體也是太累了
You must be so tired.

114
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,960
那我也得親手給他織一塊擋棺
I have to make this cloth.

115
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,120
我現在就給您買去  行嗎
Can't I just buy one?

116
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,620
買的我不要  我叫你搬你就搬
No, just bring me the loom.

117
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,150
咱們村子裏  根本就沒有織布機了
The only loom left in the village...

118
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,160
你媽呀  還留這麼一個
his this one of your mother's.

119
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
當寶貝似的留著
She's guarded it like a treasure.

120
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,660
看起來呀  你媽要織布  修的這個織布機要織布
Looks like she's determined to use it.

121
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,170
那就是要抬了
Just like the funeral procession.

122
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:33,170
抬的意思也就是過去那麼個老習慣
Carrying the dead is an old custom.

123
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,170
什麼過個山了
Over the mountains...

124
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,180
過個溝了  過個路口了
across the river, past the crossroads.

125
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,180
這就喊著點
And we shout at him along the way.

126
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,680
就喊點什麼呢  什麼意思呢
What do we say?

127
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,680
就是走這兒  叫他記住這個道兒
We tell him this is the road home.

128
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,690
大伙在這喊著點
Everyone yells at him,

129
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,190
叫他記住這個道兒
so that he remembers his way home.

130
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,190
就這麼個意思
It's an old tradition.

131
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,190
夏大叔  我想問問
Is it really so difficult

132
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:58,200
要是非抬不可的話  咱村裏確實有困難  真抬不了
to do as my mother wishes?

133
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,700
咱們村裏確實有困難
It is a problem, yes.

134
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,700
這個沒有勞力
We don't have the manpower.

135
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,710
勞力都出去了  加了就是老的老小的小了
All our young people have left.

136
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,710
抬回來  那都是文化大革命以前的事兒了
No one has followed this custom...

137
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,210
現在誰抬你  確實在沒有人
since the Cultural Revolution.

138
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,730
我真不想讓母親織這塊布
I don't want her to work like this...

139
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,730
可我不知道怎樣勸她
but I don't know how to stop her.

140
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,730
把父親抬回來
The funeral procession...

141
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,740
似乎是母親現在唯一的想法
seems all that matters to her now.

142
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,750
媽  聽老村長說  您想把爸抬回來
Mother, I know about your wishes for the funeral.

143
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,260
是的
Yes.

144
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,760
我是想  挺麻煩的  要不然就再想個辦法
Is there some other way to arrange it?

145
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,260
你別替他們操心麻煩
I know it won't be easy.

146
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,280
你看你爸到這村四十多年
But your father lived here for 40 years.

147
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:16,770
為這個學校  給他們培養出多少左一代右一代的學生
He taught many generations of kids.

148
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,990
起早睡晚的  心都操碎了
He worked very hard. Long, long hours.

149
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,280
咱們就這麼點事兒  他們給咱們講出這麼些困難
The town should give him something back.

150
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,290
那村長倒是沒有別的意思
The mayor agrees with you.

151
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,290
他就說了個困難
How about this?

152
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,790
我是覺得吧  媽  你說拿人抬回來
We can walk alongside...

153
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,290
和拖拉機拉回來  不是都一樣嗎
with the coffin pulled by a tractor.

154
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,800
不都是接我爸回來
We'd still be with him, right?

155
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,300
這個就不一樣
It's not the same.

156
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,300
怎麼也得找人去
I want your father carried back...

157
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,320
把你爸一塊兒接回來
by the men.

158
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,810
再不成  他們有困難  咱們想辦法
If they won't help...

159
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,830
咱們去人  一塊兒把你爸接回來
we'll get someone who will.

160
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,330
你今天晚上就別織了  行嗎
Please don't work anymore.

161
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:15,330
這塊布  我非得一定要把它織完了
I have to. I have to finish it.

162
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:19,340
你累好幾天了  你休息休息吧  行嗎
You are tired. Get some rest, okay?

163
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,640
你上你爸上課那屋睡覺吧
You sleep in your father's study.

164
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,340
我今天還非得把它織出來
I have to finish this.

165
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,480
這張照片  還是父親和母親結婚那年照的
This picture was taken the year my parents married.

166
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,410
父親原本不是我們三合屯的人
My father was not from the village.

167
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,410
他是後來才來的
He came here to teach.

168
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,920
當年父親和母親談戀愛的事兒
The story of my parents' courtship...

169
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,420
曾經轟動一時
is well-known in the village.

170
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,920
村裏人說來說去的  聽起來都像個故事
Practically everyone here has heard about it.

171
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,930
那年母親剛滿十八歲
My mother had just turned 18.

172
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,430
父親也只有二十歲
My father was 20.

173
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,930
聽母親說
My mother told me

174
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:57,940
是一輛馬車把父親拉到了三合屯
my father arrived by horse cart.

175
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,450
駕
Yah!

176
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:15,950
駕
Yah!

177
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,480
這就是來咱們三合屯教書的先生
This is our new teacher, Mr. Luo.

178
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,480
- 姓駱  叫駱長余    - 別叫先生  叫老師就行了
- His name is Luo, Luo Changyu.    - Just call me Luo.

179
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,530
是娣兒呀
Is that Di?

180
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,040
慌慌張張的幹啥呢
What's all the racket for?

181
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,540
沒幹啥
Nothing.

182
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:47,040
今兒一大早鬧鬧轟轟的  都說是去看先生  先生來了嗎
Has the teacher arrived?

183
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,550
來了
Yes.

184
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,550
這多好  咱們三合屯  總算也有了先生了
It's about time we got our own teacher.

185
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,550
那先生是啥樣啊
What does he look like?

186
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,550
是個小伙子
He's a young man.

187
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,560
小伙子  小伙子就當先生了
A young teacher?

188
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,060
這小伙子倒真能耐
He must be talented.

189
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,560
那他住哪兒呀
Where is he staying?

190
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,560
村政府吧
At the village council office.

191
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,070
村政府倒也行
That's good.

192
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:12,570
那東屋有鋪炕  吃飯呢
Where will he eat?

193
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:16,070
吃派飯  一家一天輪著吃
He'll eat with a different family each day.

194
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,570
那也該派到咱家
When it's our turn,

195
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,590
到時候啊  可得給先生吃飽嘍
we'll have to make a good meal.

196
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,080
娣兒  你在幹啥呢
What are you doing?

197
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,090
沒幹啥
Nothing.

198
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:32,590
看先生就看先生
Seeing a teacher

199
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,590
還換什麼新衣裳
has you changing clothes?

200
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,100
姥姥的眼睛那時候已經瞎了
My grandmother was already blind by then.

201
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,360
聽母親說  是姥爺死的時候
Mother says when Grandfather died...

202
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,240
姥姥天天哭  把眼睛給哭壞了
Grandmother cried until she went blind.

203
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,110
姥爺死後
After Grandfather died,

204
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:56,610
家裏就沒有其他人了  就母親陪著姥姥
there was only Mother to look after Grandmother.

205
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,120
姥姥一門心思
Grandmother's only wish

206
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,620
想給母親找個好婆家
was to find a good husband for Mother.

207
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,120
提親的人倒是很多
She had many proposals...

208
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,620
母親一個都沒看上
but my mother didn't like any of them.

209
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,130
父親已經來了
The schoolhouse was not yet built

210
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,130
村裏的學校還沒有蓋好
when my father arrived.

211
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:18,360
那幾天  村長正領著鄉親們趕著蓋
The mayor enlisted all the men's help.

212
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,140
照我們當地的習俗
According to our village custom...

213
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,640
新房蓋好的時候
a red cloth must be hung in a new building.

214
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,640
都要在樑上裹一塊紅布  圖個吉利
It's hung on the ceiling beam for good luck.

215
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,600
這塊布就叫紅
The cloth is called the lucky red banner.

216
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,300
通常是由
It must be woven

217
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,150
村裏最漂亮的姑娘來織
by the village's most beautiful maiden.

218
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:37,150
這次織紅的事兒  自然又落在了我母親的身上
This task, of course, fell to my mother.

219
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,660
也許是因為心裏有了父親的原因吧
Perhaps she was already a little in love...

220
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,660
這塊紅  母親織得格外仔細
because the cloth she made was especially fine.

221
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:56,670
當年村裏有兩口井
The village had two wells back then.

222
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,680
以前的井叫前井
The old well was called the "front well."

223
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,680
後來新打的那口井叫後井
The newer well was called the "back well."

224
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,680
後井近
The new well was nearer the village,

225
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,180
人們通常都在後井打水
so more people used that one.

226
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,690
自從父親來了以後
After my father arrived...

227
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,190
母親就改在前井打水了
Mother started to use the old well.

228
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,690
因為這樣會路過學校
She had to pass the schoolhouse to get to it.

229
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,250
照那時候的規矩
The village had another custom.

230
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,250
凡是蓋房這類大事兒
When putting up a new building,

231
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,750
家家戶戶都要往工地上送飯  給幹活兒的男人吃
each family prepared a dish for the workers' lunch.

232
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,760
這叫送公飯
Everyone contributed.

233
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,260
那幾天  母親盡挑好吃的做
Mother prepared all her best dishes,

234
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,760
她總希望父親能吃上她親手做的飯
hoping Father would eat what she made.

235
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:51,290
聽母親說  以前有挺多事兒  女人都不能上前
Back then when something was built...

236
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:55,290
比方說蓋房子  還有打井這種大事兒
women were not allowed to participate.

237
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,300
說怕沾上邪氣兒
Superstition said they would bring bad luck.

238
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,300
所以現在蓋學校
When they put up the school,

239
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,300
村裏的婦女們就只能離得遠遠的
the village women could only watch

240
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,300
在一邊看
from a distance.

241
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,330
大姐  今天你送的什麼飯呀
What did you make today?

242
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,330
饅頭和烙餅
Steamed bread.

243
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,800
招娣  你送的什麼飯
What about you, Di?

244
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,300
我送蔥油餅
I made onion cakes.

245
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,350
你送蔥油餅  我送苞米碴干飯
I brought rice steamed in lotus leaves.

246
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,300
苞米碴干飯可沒有蔥油餅好吃
Onion cakes are better.

247
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,800
你留什麼好吃的  晚上偷著給你男人吃呢
Did you save some for your boyfriend?

248
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,840
你胡說
Shut up!

249
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,350
你沒看見嗎
Look at them.

250
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,350
他們都是亂吃
They just pick up the first dish they see.

251
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,850
誰也不知道誰吃的誰家的
They don't know who made what.

252
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,350
我送的包子不知道誰吃了
I don't know who's eating mine.

253
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,850
讓你男人吃了
Must be your husband!

254
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,360
放著吧
Put them here.

255
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,920
招娣  你把紅給送來了
You're already done with the banner?

256
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,850
我還正要到你家去取呢
I was going to come get it from you.

257
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,420
給我  給我啊
Give it to me.

258
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,430
行  行  給你
Okay.

259
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,430
還省得我給你去送呢
You'll save me a further trip.

260
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,430
招娣  你這紅織得可真好
This is a beautiful banner.

261
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,930
過兩天一上梁  學校蓋好了  就能上課了
The school is almost finished.

262
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,450
先生說  第一天上語文
Chinese study will be the first lesson.

263
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,440
那先生這兩天吃得好不好
Is the teacher happy with the food?

264
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,940
好啊
Yes.

265
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,450
他也跟著吃公飯
Does he eat what we make?

266
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,450
是啊
Yes.

267
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,450
那他也搶著吃
He eats together with you?

268
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,450
哪能吶  人家是城裏來的文化人
No. He's a city gentleman.

269
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,450
不能和咱們一塊搶著吃
It's not proper for him to eat with us.

270
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,460
那他咋吃的
So how does it work?

271
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,960
每次都是緊著先生端頭一份兒
We give him first pick of the dishes.

272
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,050
人生在世  念
"In life--" Follow me.

273
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,510
人生在世
"In life--"

274
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,560
要有志氣  念
"You must make goals."

275
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,610
要有志氣
"You must make goals."

276
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,240
好  咱們再讀第二遍
Start from the beginning.

277
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:30,070
讀書識字  多長見識  念
"One must learn to write." Follow me.

278
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,070
讀書識字  多長見識
"One must learn to write."

279
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,570
能寫會算  是件好事  念
"One must learn arithmetic."

280
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,580
能寫會算  是件好事
"One must learn arithmetic."

281
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,980
大事小情  提筆就記  念
"Keep a journal faithfully."

282
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,590
大事小情  提筆就記
"Keep a journal faithfully."

283
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:54,590
知今知古  知天知地  念
"Know the present, know the past."

284
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:58,090
知今知古  知天知地
"Know the present, know the past."

285
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,600
小時候聽母親說起過
When I was young, my mother told me

286
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,600
父親唸書的聲音特別好聽
my father had a beautiful voice.

287
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,100
母親不識字
My mother never learned to write,

288
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,600
有的課文她也聽不懂
was never interested in school.

289
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,110
但是她覺得父親的聲音是天底下最好聽的聲音
But she couldn't resist the sound of my father's voice.

290
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:16,110
從這一天開始  母親就天天去聽
She went by the school every day after that.

291
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,300
後來村裏人習慣了  就沒人再去聽了
For most, the novelty of the new school wore off after a while...

292
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,620
可是母親還是去聽
but not for my mother.

293
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,620
她一聽就聽了四十多年
For 40 years, she came to listen...

294
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,620
這已經成了她生活中的一部分
and it became part of her life.

295
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:33,130
長幼尊卑  敬重有序  念
"Know respect for your elders."

296
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:37,130
長幼尊卑  敬重有序
"Know respect for your elders."

297
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:55,150
母親聽說每天放學的時候
Each day after school...

298
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:58,150
父親都要送幾個路遠的孩子回家
my father walked some of his students home.

299
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,950
她就動了心思  想在那條路上碰見父親
Knowing this, my mother waited along the way.

300
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:36,600
太陽光  金亮亮  雄雞唱三唱
♪ The birds sing with the beautiful sun ♪

301
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:42,000
花兒醒來了  鳥兒忙梳妝
♪ Their songs wake the beautiful flowers ♪

302
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,160
嘿
Hey!

303
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,170
她是誰呀
Who is she?

304
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,170
她是老田家的招娣
That's Zhao Di.

305
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,680
那她是咱三合屯的人嗎
Is she from Sanhetun?

306
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,680
住在後街那兒
Yes.

307
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,120
招娣姐  我們老師問你呢
Di, the teacher is asking about you!

308
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,290
先生  挑水去
You need water?

309
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,290
唉
Yes.

310
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,290
來來來  我幫你挑
Let me get it for you.

311
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,300
不用  我自己來
No, that's okay.

312
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,300
我來我來
Let me do it.

313
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,800
不  不  不  沒事兒  沒事兒
I can do it. Thanks.

314
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,800
你客氣什麼嘛  這活兒我們都幹慣了
No, let me. Let me help you!

315
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,800
您是教書的  您怎麼能幹這活呢
You're the teacher. You shouldn't bother.

316
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,310
我來  我來
Let me do it.

317
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,310
不用  我自己來就行
No, no.

318
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,310
不行  不行
Come on.

319
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,480
我行
Let me do it.

320
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,100
招娣  你咋跑前井打水來啦
Di, you're fetching water as well?

321
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,340
明天該輪到我家吃飯了
Tomorrow it's our turn to have you over.

322
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,840
我知道
I know.

323
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,920
父親對我說過
My father told me...

324
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,930
他第一次到母親家吃派飯的時候
the first time he went to my mother's house,

325
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:05,930
母親站在門口迎他
she stood in the doorway.

326
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,930
他記得母親扶著門框  站在門口的樣子
Leaning against the door frame...

327
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:11,430
就像一幅畫
she looked like a figure in a painting...

328
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,450
他說很多年他都忘不了這幅畫
an image he would never forget.

329
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:23,950
娣兒  是先生來了吧
Is the teacher here?

330
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:24,950
來了
Yes.

331
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,950
我就說嘛  這腳步聲這麼重
Your heavy footsteps gave you away.

332
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:30,950
快到屋裏來  我看看
Come in. Come here.

333
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,460
我娘的眼睛壞了
My mother's eyesight is not good.

334
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,960
噢
Oh.

335
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,460
這先生這麼高啊
This teacher is very tall.

336
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,780
坐下  坐下
Sit down.

337
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,500
上炕吧
Please!

338
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:29,510
家裏多少年沒有男人吃飯了
Can't think when we last had a man home for dinner.

339
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:32,010
聽聽  吃得真香啊
The food must taste good to you.

340
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,530
嚼得多有勁啊
You sound like you're enjoying it.

341
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,020
先生來咱們三合屯有一個月了吧
How long have you been here?

342
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,020
一個多月了
About a month.

343
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,530
還待得慣嗎
Have you gotten used to it?

344
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,030
待得慣
It's okay.

345
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:46,030
待得慣就好
That's good.

346
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,030
先生家在縣上住
You're from the city?

347
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,030
縣上東關
Yes, from East Gate.

348
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:52,030
那咋來三合屯呢
How did you choose Sanhetun?

349
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,040
學校畢業  在家沒事兒
After graduation, I couldn't find work.

350
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,040
在縣上亂逛  看見敲鑼打鼓的  喊人報名
One day in the street, a man was signing people up.

351
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,540
也不知道幹啥的  沒仔細問  我就報了一個
I didn't know what for, but I signed up anyway.

352
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,040
這不就來了
And I ended up here.

353
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,050
那不後悔
Do you regret it?

354
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,550
不後悔
No.

355
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,550
為啥
Why?

356
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,550
我喜歡
I like it here.

357
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:12,560
先生還沒成家
Are you married?

358
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,060
沒呢
No.

359
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,560
也沒定親
Are you engaged?

360
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,060
沒呢
No.

361
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:27,070
你別管  讓招娣收拾  坐著  歇會兒
Di will do it. Sit for a while.

362
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,590
你認得我家的碗嗎
Do you remember this bowl?

363
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,590
就這青花的
This design?

364
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,090
我不認得
No, I don't remember.

365
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,090
你吃沒吃公飯
Did you eat the food brought to the site?

366
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,600
吃了
Yes.

367
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,600
這可真是瞎了招娣的一片心了
Looks like Di's hard work was wasted.

368
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:01,600
別看都不說  我可都知道  蓋學堂  吃公飯
You know when you were building the school,

369
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,610
她是調著樣兒做好的
she made all her best dishes.

370
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:06,110
回回都拿這青花碗送過去
She always used that bowl,

371
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,610
就指盼著先生能吃上一口
hoping you would choose her dish.

372
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:11,110
連我都不讓動上一筷子
Even I wasn't allowed to help.

373
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,780
噢  吃公飯啊  這碗我還真使過
I remember now.

374
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,620
你使過
You do?

375
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,120
我說嘛  有點眼熟  使過
The bowl and your cooking are familiar.

376
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,620
碗裏的飯你也吃了
So you ate from it before?

377
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,630
吃了
Yes.

378
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,130
你說  都吃啥了
You did? What did you eat?

379
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,130
呃
Uh...

380
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,640
我跟你說  我頭一天送的是蔥花油餅
On the first day, I made onion cakes.

381
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,140
第二天  送的是小米飯  蔥花炒雞蛋
On the second, scrambled eggs and onions on rice.

382
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,640
第三天  送的是蘑菇餡蒸餃
On the third day, mushroom dumplings.

383
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,640
真可惜啦  這麼好吃的三頓飯
What a shame. Three delicious meals.

384
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:44,150
蘑菇餡蒸餃我最愛吃了
And I love mushroom dumplings.

385
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:46,150
那你後晌來  我給你做
I'll make you some this afternoon.

386
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,200
太麻煩了
That is too much to ask.

387
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,200
不麻煩
No.

388
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,300
這剛吃了前晌
You've hardly finished lunch,

389
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,660
就惦著後晌了
and you're planning the next meal.

390
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:56,160
招娣  送先生走  先生還忙著呢
Di, show the teacher out. He must be very busy.

391
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,160
對  我該走了
Yes, I should go.

392
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,180
你穿那件紅衣裳真好看
That red jacket of yours is pretty on you.

393
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,180
來的頭一天我就看見了
I remember it from the day I arrived.

394
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,680
- 後晌你一定要來吃餃子    - 唉
- Don't forget to come back for dumplings.    - Okay.

395
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,700
我說  就別包那餃子了
You shouldn't make the dumplings.

396
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,200
為啥不包
Why not?

397
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,800
免得後悔
You may regret it.

398
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,200
我悔啥
Why?

399
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,200
悔啥你自己知道
You don't understand.

400
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:44,210
那先生  好是好
This teacher is a nice man,

401
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:47,210
他跟咱不是一路人  這事兒不成
but he's out of our class.

402
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,710
有啥成不成的  不就吃頓餃子嗎
What are you talking about? It's only dumplings.

403
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:52,210
你別給我裝糊塗
Don't play dumb.

404
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,720
我把話給你撂下
I'm just being honest.

405
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,220
你就死了這心吧
You'd best forget about him.

406
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,750
我不回去就是不回去
I will not go back!

407
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:26,250
你別無選擇
You've got no choice!

408
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:09,350
我來跟你說一聲  我要走了
I came to say goodbye.

409
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:11,850
走  走哪兒啊
Where are you going?

410
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:12,860
我回縣裏面
Back to the city.

411
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,360
啥事兒這麼急
What's happened?

412
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,360
沒啥事兒
Nothing.

413
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,860
我在井台上看到他跟你吵架了
I saw you argue with someone.

414
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,860
是他叫你回去的
Was that what it was about?

415
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:24,370
他是誰呀  你回去幹啥
Who was he? Why do you have to go back?

416
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:25,370
真沒啥事兒
It's no big deal.

417
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,370
他們是有事兒問我  問完就完了唄
They just want to ask me some questions. That's all.

418
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:29,370
那在這兒不能問
Can't they ask you questions here?

419
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:30,870
他做不了主
He says it's not up to him.

420
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,380
那你還回來嗎
Will you come back?

421
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:40,880
回來  我一定回來  學生們等我上課呢
Of course. I have classes to teach.

422
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,540
那你啥時候回來
When will you be back?

423
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,480
最晚  臘月初八我一定回來
By the 27th at the latest.

424
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,360
臘月初九  學生放假
On the 28th, the school holiday starts.

425
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,360
我得在放假前回來
I have to be back before that.

426
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,400
進屋吃餃子吧
Come in and eat something.

427
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,900
餃子恐怕吃不了了
I can't.

428
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,900
還有事兒呢  你和你娘就別等了
I have things to do before I go.

429
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:04,410
真還有事兒呢  他等著我呢
I really do. That man is waiting for me.

430
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:06,410
那你招呼他一塊兒來吃吧
Tell him to come too.

431
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,640
啥要緊事兒也得先吃飯吶
You have to eat in any case.

432
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,420
行  我來吃
Okay, I'll be back.

433
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,420
那我等著你
I'll wait for you.

434
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,930
這個是我給你買的
This is for you.

435
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:25,430
配你那件紅衣裳  好看
To go with your red jacket.

436
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,440
那我等著你啊
I'll be waiting.

437
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,940
唉
Okay.

438
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,400
到底咋回事兒啊  這不正上課著嗎
What is going on? No more class?

439
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,900
說是要讓他當個右派
He's in some political trouble.

440
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:56,240
啥派
Political trouble?

441
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,960
我也整不明白  反正沒啥大事兒
I don't understand it either. But maybe it's nothing.

442
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,960
說不定過兩天就回來了
Said he might be back in a day or two.

443
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:24,500
先生走了
The teacher's left.

444
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,500
先生走了嗎
The teacher's left?

445
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,500
走了
Yes.

446
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,500
他走了
Just left?

447
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,000
剛剛村長他們把他送走
Just left with the mayor.

448
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:13,280
母親一連好幾天早出晚歸
My mother retraced her steps every day...

449
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,280
她把那幾十里山路都跑遍了
searching back and forth.

450
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,860
她想找到父親留給她的那支髮夾
She had to find the clip my father had given her.

451
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,720
修碗  修盆
Pottery repairs!

452
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:11,230
鋦碗的
Pottery repairs!

453
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:13,730
鋦碗的  進來
Please come in.

454
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:48,820
我是照釘收錢的
I charge for the nails I use.

455
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:51,330
這比買一個新碗可貴多了
This will cost you more than buying a new bowl.

456
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:55,330
該多少錢給多少錢  分文不短你的
Just tell me how much, and I'll pay you.

457
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:57,330
是祖上傳下來的嗎
Is it a family heirloom?

458
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:59,330
倒也不是
No.

459
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:01,840
那就是有人使過
It belonged to someone special?

460
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,340
算你說對了  有人使過
You could say that.

461
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,840
誰使過
Who?

462
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:10,850
不瞞你說  我這是替閨女鋦的
It's for my daughter.

463
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:14,850
使碗的人走了  把閨女的心也帶走了
The man who used it left

464
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:18,350
把這碗鋦好了  也給閨女留個念
and took my daughter's heart with him.

465
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:23,860
我給你把它鋦得滴水不漏
I've put it back together again.

466
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,360
保準給你閨女一個好念想
I hope she'll be happy.

467
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:38,370
修碗  修盆
Pottery repairs!

468
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,900
娣兒  你幹啥呢
Di, what are you doing?

469
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,410
沒幹啥  我舀口水喝
Nothing. Just getting a drink of water.

470
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:00,960
一八得八
1 times 8 equals 8.

471
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,960
一九得九
1 times 9 equals 9.

472
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,960
二二得四
2 times 2 equals 4.

473
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,960
二三得六
2 times 3 equals 6.

474
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:12,470
二四得八
2 times 4 equals 8.

475
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:14,470
二五一十
2 times 5 equals 10.

476
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:17,470
二六一十二
2 times 6 equals 12.

477
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:20,480
二七一十四
2 times 7 equals 14.

478
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,480
二八一十六
2 times 8 equals 16.

479
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,980
二九一十八
2 times 9 equals 18.

480
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:26,960
好
Good.

481
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,990
三三得九
3 times 3 equals 9.

482
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:34,490
三四一十二
3 times 4 equals 12.

483
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:37,490
三五一十五
3 times 5 equals 15.

484
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:39,990
三六一十八
3 times 6 equals 18.

485
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
三七二十一
3 times 7 equals 21.

486
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
三八二十四
3 times 8 equals 24.

487
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
三九二十七
3 times 9 equals 27.

488
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,560
父親對母親說過
My father told my mother

489
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,560
他給學生上課的時候
when he was teaching the kids,

490
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,070
一抬眼就能看見樑上那塊紅
he could always look up and see the red banner.

491
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:53,070
一看見那紅
When he saw that banner

492
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:56,570
就想起母親穿紅棉襖的樣子
it reminded him of Mother and her red jacket.

493
00:57:56,570 --> 00:57:58,570
後來村長說過好幾次
The mayor kept insisting

494
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:00,580
要給教室吊個頂棚
that the ceiling needed proper insulation,

495
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:03,080
都被父親謝絕了
but my father never let him.

496
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:07,580
所以我們村的這個小學校  幾十年來就一直沒有頂棚
That's why the school ceiling was never completed.

497
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:08,620
那天母親在教室裏一直坐到很晚
Mother sat in the classroom for hours that day.

498
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:12,120
教室門開著  被村長看見了
The door was open, and the mayor saw her there.

499
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:15,530
村長這才明白了母親的心思
He understood what that meant.

500
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:17,630
村長知道了
Once he knew,

501
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:20,130
村裏人很快也都知道了
the news got around the village, quickly.

502
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:22,130
在當年
Back then, arranged matches were the rule.

503
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:25,040
自由戀愛還是一件很新鮮的事兒
The freedom of falling in love was unfamiliar.

504
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:27,640
母親給三合屯開了個頭
This was a first for our village.

505
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,900
到了父親答應回來的日子
On the day my father promised to return...

506
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:45,410
母親一大早就站在那條路上等
my mother was waiting from first light.

507
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:47,910
她記著父親說過的那句話
She remembered his promise:

508
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:50,410
臘月初八一定回來
that he would return on the 27th.

509
01:00:50,410 --> 01:00:53,410
因為臘月初九學校就放假了
School vacation began on the 28th.

510
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:56,380
父親得在放假前趕回來
He had to be back before that.

511
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:20,300
看這身寒氣  幹啥去了  一天不著家
It's so cold out. Where have you been?

512
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,640
快上炕躺會兒
Gone all day. Get warm on the bed.

513
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:35,490
這麼燙  娣兒  你病了
You're burning up!

514
01:04:08,530 --> 01:04:11,030
我知道你昨天迎先生去了
I know you went to wait for the teacher.

515
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:14,640
村裏的人都說  先生犯了錯誤  回不來了
Everyone says he's in trouble and won't be back.

516
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,540
你就別操這份心了
You've got to let go.

517
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:21,540
我到縣上找他去
I'm going to the city to find him.

518
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:25,040
你瘋了  你還病著呢  你上縣上咋找
Are you crazy?! You're ill!

519
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:29,060
娣兒  你回來  回來
Di! Come back!

520
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:12,090
那天母親沒走到縣城
My mother didn't make it to the city.

521
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:14,590
卻暈倒在半路上
She fainted by the road.

522
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:18,600
有過路人看見  給村裏捎了信兒
Someone saw her, and they got word to the mayor.

523
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:23,600
村長和夏大叔他們套上馬車  連夜把母親拉了回來
The mayor and my uncle brought her home on a cart.

524
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:26,200
我記得村長後來跟我說過一次
The mayor said that day,

525
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,900
說那天母親的兩手冰涼冰涼的
my mother's hands were like ice.

526
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:31,110
在馬車上
While on the cart,

527
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:33,110
他用皮襖暖了一路
they wrapped her in a heavy blanket,

528
01:05:33,110 --> 01:05:35,110
都沒暖過來
but they couldn't get her hands warm.

529
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,120
不要緊  凍著了
I don't think it's too serious.

530
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:47,420
虛火上升  氣血淤滯  歇兩天就好了
It's a bad chill, but she is strong.

531
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:55,130
村長  你說說  這先生到底還能不能回來
Mayor, is the teacher coming back?

532
01:05:57,140 --> 01:06:00,540
這城裏人的事兒  我也整不清楚
I don't know the answer.

533
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:03,480
照理說  他也該早回來了
He should have been back by now.

534
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,650
你們有誰方便啊  就給先生捎個信
Maybe someone can write to him.

535
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:11,250
他不回來  招娣咋辦  我也攔不住她呀
I don't know how to help her...

536
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:15,860
就讓先生回來呀  看上她一眼也好啊
if he doesn't come back.

537
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:29,030
春天來了
"Spring is here."

538
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:31,540
春天來了
"Spring is here."

539
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:33,520
春風吹化了冰雪
"It melts the snow."

540
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,010
春風吹化了冰雪
"It melts the snow."

541
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:38,510
吹綠了草地
"The grass turns green."

542
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:41,010
吹綠了草地
"The grass turns green."

543
01:06:41,010 --> 01:06:43,510
農民在種莊稼
"The farmers sow."

544
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,020
農民在種莊稼
"The farmers sow."

545
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:47,520
牛在耕田
"The ox plow the field."

546
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,520
牛在耕田
"The ox plow the field."

547
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,520
大雁回來了
"The wild geese return."

548
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:54,030
大雁回來了
"The wild geese return."

549
01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:56,530
青蛙結束了冬眠
"The frogs begin to hop."

550
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:58,030
青蛙結束了冬眠
"The frogs begin to hop."

551
01:06:58,030 --> 01:06:59,530
娣兒  你醒了
Di, you're awake.

552
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:01,530
你都睡了兩天了
You've been sleeping for two days.

553
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:03,230
你還不知道呢
Di, the teacher is back.

554
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:05,960
先生回來了
The teacher is back.

555
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:09,040
先生昨晚就回來了
He came back yesterday.

556
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:11,040
一回來就上咱們家來了
He came straight here.

557
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:13,540
就在這兒守了你半宿
He sat with you for a long time.

558
01:07:13,550 --> 01:07:18,000
娣兒  這下可好了  先生回來了
Isn't it good news?

559
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:20,050
他這是為你回來的呀
He came back for you.

560
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:24,060
充滿勃勃的生機
"Full of energy."

561
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:27,560
我們的心情也跟萬物一樣
"Our spirit comes alive."

562
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:32,060
我們的心情也跟萬物一樣
"Our spirit comes alive."

563
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:34,070
充滿新的希望
"It carries our wishes."

564
01:07:34,070 --> 01:07:36,570
充滿新的希望
"It carries our wishes."

565
01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:39,070
充滿新的理想
"Full of hope."

566
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:42,570
充滿新的理想
"Full of hope."

567
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:44,090
春天來了
"Spring is here."

568
01:07:44,090 --> 01:07:46,080
春天來了
"Spring is here."

569
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,580
春風吹化了冰雪
"It melts the snow."

570
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:51,580
春風吹化了冰雪
"It melts the snow."

571
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:53,580
吹綠了草地
"The grass turns green."

572
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:55,590
吹綠了草地
"The grass turns green."

573
01:07:55,590 --> 01:07:58,090
農民在種莊稼
"The farmers sow."

574
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:00,090
農民在種莊稼
"The farmers sow."

575
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:02,090
牛在耕田
"The ox plow the field."

576
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:04,600
牛在耕田
"The ox plow the field."

577
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,100
大雁飛來了
"The wild geese return."

578
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:08,600
大雁飛來了
"The wild geese return."

579
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,100
青蛙結束了冬眠
"The frogs begin to hop."

580
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:14,610
青蛙結束了冬眠
"The frogs begin to hop."

581
01:08:14,610 --> 01:08:18,110
小燕子在欣喜地喳喳叫
"Swallows start to sing."

582
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:22,610
小燕子在欣喜地喳喳叫
"Swallows start to sing."

583
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:25,130
春天是播種的季節
"Spring is the season to sow."

584
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:28,120
春天是播種的季節
"Spring is the season to sow."

585
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,620
萬物都在生長
"All starts to grow again."

586
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:33,620
萬物都在生長
"All starts to grow again."

587
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:35,140
充滿勃勃的生機
"The world is full of life again."

588
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:36,630
充滿勃勃的生機
"The world is full of life again."

589
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:38,630
駱先生
Mr. Luo!

590
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:41,130
駱先生  招娣來看你了
Mr. Luo, Di is here to see you!

591
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,650
先生  先生
Sir!

592
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:47,140
招娣來了
Di is here!

593
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:55,150
天黑前  剛剛回來的父親就又被叫走了
That evening, my father had to leave again.

594
01:08:55,150 --> 01:08:58,150
因為他是偷著跑回來的
When he heard about my mother, he left the city...

595
01:08:58,150 --> 01:09:00,150
他是聽說了母親的情況後
without permission.

596
01:09:00,150 --> 01:09:02,150
實在忍不住
He couldn't stand it any longer,

597
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:04,660
就私自跑回來了
so he sneaked back.

598
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:07,160
由於父親的這次行為
For this disobedience,

599
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:11,160
使他和母親最後見面的日子又推遲了好幾年
my parents were kept apart for another two years.

600
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:15,170
後來  我聽鄉親們說
Someone told me,

601
01:09:15,170 --> 01:09:19,170
當父親真正和母親相聚的那一天到來時
that on the day my father finally returned,

602
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:21,670
母親又特意穿上了那件
my mother put on her red jacket,

603
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:23,170
父親喜愛的紅棉襖
my father's favorite,

604
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:25,680
站在路邊等著父親
and stood by the road to wait for him.

605
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:30,180
從那天起  父親就再沒離開過母親一步
From that day on, my father never left my mother again.

606
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:51,200
這就是父親和母親的故事
This is the story of my father and my mother.

607
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:54,710
他們相識  相愛的過程  都和這條路有關
This road is part of their love story...

608
01:09:56,210 --> 01:10:00,710
這是我們村通往縣城的一條普通的山路
this road that leads from the city to our village.

609
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:03,710
也許就因為母親曾經那麼殷切
Maybe because of the hope it held for her

610
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:07,720
那麼長久地在這條路上等待過父親
as she waited for my father to return,

611
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:11,220
所以她還想陪著父親  再從這條路上走回來
she wants to walk this way with him one last time.

612
01:10:12,730 --> 01:10:13,730
村長
Mr. Mayor?

613
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:16,730
村長
Mr. Mayor?

614
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:17,730
誰呀
Who is it?

615
01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:19,230
我  生子
It's me, Yusheng.

616
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:28,240
- 生子  有事兒嗎    - 有事兒
- You need to see me?    - Yes.

617
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:31,740
有事兒快進屋說  來  天挺冷的
Come in, come in. It's cold out there.

618
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:33,740
有什麼事兒啊
How can I help you?

619
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:37,750
我媽的心思啊  我想明白了
I've thought it through.

620
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,250
咱們還是抬吧
I want to do as my mother wishes.

621
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:41,250
你也要抬
To carry him back?

622
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:43,750
可是咱們村還有點困難
It's still a problem, though.

623
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,760
不就是人手不夠嗎
The problem is not enough men, right?

624
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,260
你看這樣行不行  村長
How about this:

625
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:50,760
咱們到鄰村雇點人來
We'll hire men from the next village.

626
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,860
僱人  鄰村倒是好雇
That's a good idea.

627
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:56,270
現在就這錢
But how do we pay them?

628
01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:59,270
那沒關係  您幫我算算得多少人
Just tell me how many men we need.

629
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:04,280
人嘛  要是近點  有十幾多個人就夠
For a short distance, only 10,

630
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,280
因為咱們這兒離縣城太遠
but this is a long trip.

631
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:09,780
這個你必須得十六個人的杠子
I think we need about 16.

632
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:12,780
得兩班  兩班就得三十二個
We will need two shifts. That's 32 men.

633
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:17,100
三十二個呢  再有幾個閒人  拿凳子放在路中
And we'll need others to carry chairs,

634
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:20,290
有的人累了  可以擱上歇歇
so people can rest along the way.

635
01:11:20,290 --> 01:11:24,300
這總共得個三十五六個人吧
That comes to about 35, 36 men.

636
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,800
那一個人得多少錢呢
How much per person?

637
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:31,300
一個人  現在咱就給他一百塊錢
One hundred yuan each should do.

638
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,800
就可以了
That will do.

639
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:34,310
三十五六個人
Thirty-five, 36 people.

640
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:37,310
那你給算算總共得多少錢
How much in total?

641
01:11:37,310 --> 01:11:41,810
人嘛  三十五六個人  三千五六百塊錢
That's 3500 or 3600 yuan.

642
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:45,820
下來呀  有抽煙的  咱們還要給他買點煙
We need to buy cigarettes.

643
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:50,820
有喝酒的  這酒我也得買點  因為天太冷
And wine too, gotta ward off the cold.

644
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:54,830
要有點什麼事兒  都得用點錢
We'll also want a little extra for emergency use.

645
01:11:54,830 --> 01:12:00,480
可能有四千多塊錢  就差不多了
Altogether, around 4000 yuan.

646
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:11,340
村長  這是五千塊錢  夠不夠
Here's 5000 yuan. Is that enough?

647
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:13,340
足夠了  用不了
It's more than enough.

648
01:12:59,390 --> 01:13:02,890
老嫂子  去看看駱先生吧
Mrs. Luo, come and see Mr. Luo.

649
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,900
去看的時候可別哭
Please don't cry.

650
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:07,400
別讓眼淚掉在駱先生身上  不好的
Don't let tears fall on him.

651
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:21,910
駱先生  咱們現在回村了  要走好
Mr. Luo, we are going back to the village.

652
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:26,920
那天抬棺來了一百多個人
That day over 100 people came to the ceremony.

653
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:30,420
聽村長說  他們都是父親的學生
The mayor told me they were my father's students.

654
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:35,430
他們知道了這件事情  就都趕來了
They heard about his death, and they all came back.

655
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:38,930
有很多人都是從外地趕回來的
Many came from other towns.

656
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:41,930
也有從市裏坐著小車來的
Some drove from the city.

657
01:13:41,930 --> 01:13:46,440
村長說  最遠的有從廣州趕過來的
The mayor said some came from as far as Guangzhou.

658
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:49,440
還有幾個人被風雪誤在了半路上
Some tried, but didn't make it in time,

659
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,940
沒有來得及
because of the snowstorm.

660
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:54,450
來得人大部分我都不認識
I didn't recognize many of them.

661
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:56,950
有的人比我大得多
Many were older than me.

662
01:13:56,950 --> 01:13:59,950
我不知道他們都是父親哪一年的學生
I don't know when my father taught them.

663
01:13:59,950 --> 01:14:02,950
也不知道該怎樣稱呼他們
I didn't know how to address them.

664
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,460
村長說
Anyway, as the mayor said,

665
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:07,460
反正都是駱先生的學生嘛
they are all my father's students.

666
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,460
生子  這些錢還給你吧
Take this money back.

667
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:14,970
咋能都不要呢  不是說好了的嗎
Why? Didn't you pay the men?

668
01:14:14,970 --> 01:14:18,470
來的人都不要  就連拿錢雇的人也不要
They won't take it, not even the ones we hired.

669
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:20,470
就一分錢也不要
No one wants the money.

670
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:22,470
你還是收起來吧
Take it back.

671
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:04,640
按著母親的意思
At my mother's request,

672
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:08,140
父親就安葬在前井旁邊
my father was buried next to the old well.

673
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:11,640
村裏有了自來水  井就荒了
The village has running water now, so no one needs a well.

674
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:14,140
早就沒人再挑水了
No one draws water from it now.

675
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:16,150
母親說  在這兒
My mother says from this hill,

676
01:17:16,150 --> 01:17:19,150
父親可以天天看見學校
my father can look down on the school.

677
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:23,650
母親還說  將來她也要跟父親埋在一起
She asks to be buried next to him when the time comes.

678
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:34,670
辦完父親的後事
After my father's funeral,

679
01:17:34,670 --> 01:17:38,170
村長特意來說起了蓋學校的事兒
the mayor came to talk about rebuilding the school.

680
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:40,780
他說縣裏撥了款
The city has granted funds,

681
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:43,670
村裏家家戶戶也都捐了錢
and the village families have donated money.

682
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:47,480
說鄉親們無論如何也要完成父親的心願
He says we must fulfill my father's wishes.

683
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:51,180
生子  你帶回來的錢呢  給媽吧
Your money, give it to me.

684
01:17:57,690 --> 01:18:02,720
村長  你看  這些錢都是我這幾十年積攢的
Mayor, we've saved over the years.

685
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:06,600
你把它收起來蓋學校吧
Take it to rebuild the school.

686
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:11,000
這咋好意思呢  你說  長余不在了
I can't take it.

687
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,200
這錢你一定得收下
With my husband gone, you have to take it.

688
01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:17,220
那好  那我把這些錢先拿上
All right, I'll take it then.

689
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:20,710
咱們村  你們母子倆算第一份
You are the first, but surely not the last, to help.

690
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:24,210
明天我就要走了
I am leaving tomorrow.

691
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:27,220
母親讓我陪她再去一趟學校
Mother has asked me to go to the schoolhouse one last time.

692
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:31,220
母親說  等下次我再回來時
My mother says the next time I come back,

693
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:34,220
這所小學校就看不到了
the school we know will be gone.

694
01:18:35,730 --> 01:18:39,730
生子  你看這學校都幾十年了
Your father helped build this school.

695
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:45,240
你爸就在這學校教書
He taught here so many years.

696
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:49,240
在這裏比在家待得時間還長
Spent as much time here as at home.

697
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:54,360
長余  你都聽到了嗎
Changyu, can you hear me?

698
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:59,250
村長說了  要蓋新學校
The mayor will rebuild the school.

699
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:05,760
按你的心願去蓋  蓋一個高大  漂漂亮亮的
They'll build a tall

700
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:10,800
一個好學校
and wonderful school...

701
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:17,830
為了完成你的心願  按你的意思去蓋
just as you wished.

702
01:19:18,270 --> 01:19:21,360
明年開春就動工了
They will start building next spring.

703
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:25,780
這回你放心了吧
You won't have to worry anymore.

704
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:28,780
新學校蓋好了
When the school is completed,

705
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:32,780
我親手織一塊紅掛上去
I will hang a lucky red banner there.

706
01:19:39,290 --> 01:19:41,790
你就放心吧
You can rest easy now.

707
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:53,750
你看看你爸  實心實意
You know, your father was a sincere man.

708
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:58,760
整天跟我說  想叫你教書
He always wanted you to become a teacher,

709
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:01,760
接他的班
to take over for him.

710
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:06,770
把你送到師範學校念了
You went to the teachers' college,

711
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:08,770
一天書你也沒教上
but you never taught a day of class.

712
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:13,770
哪怕你上一天課  教一天書
If you could teach for one day,

713
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:19,780
也是你爸爸這一片心都沒有實現了
I think it would make him happy.

714
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:26,280
你就幹別的工作去了
Then you can go back to your life.

715
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:33,290
你看  學校連上課的人都沒有了
Look, there's no teacher now.

716
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:39,300
聽不到孩子們唸書的聲音了
No sound of children reciting their lessons.

717
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:43,800
聽村長說  過兩天縣上可能還會派個新老師來
The mayor said a new teacher was on the way.

718
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:49,310
新老師來
Not many teachers,

719
01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:54,960
再上課也沒有你爸爸聲音好聽啊  特別的響亮
would sound as good as your father.

720
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,320
四十多年我都沒聽夠
After 40 years, I still love that voice.

721
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:03,960
好聽呀  你爸讀書
I can still hear it.

722
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:10,330
媽  我考慮好了
Mother, I've been thinking.

723
01:21:10,330 --> 01:21:13,240
這次你跟我回城裏  咱們一塊兒住
Why don't you come to the city with me?

724
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:16,840
我不去
No, thank you.

725
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:20,340
有你爸在這兒  哪兒我也不去
I won't leave your father.

726
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:24,340
把你自己留在這兒  讓我咋放心呢
How can I leave you here alone?

727
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:28,350
別為我擔心
Don't worry about me.

728
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:30,850
我自己會照顧我自己的
I can take care of myself.

729
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:34,350
你在城裏工作都好吧
Are you doing all right in the city?

730
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:35,360
好  媽
Yes.

731
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,860
特別好  你放心吧
Don't worry about me.

732
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:39,860
有女朋友嗎
Do you have a girlfriend?

733
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:43,860
到時候再說吧
Let's not talk about it.

734
01:21:43,870 --> 01:21:47,370
你看  你都那麼大歲數了
You're not young anymore.

735
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:49,370
別挑剔了啊
Don't be so picky.

736
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:53,370
你聽媽告訴你
Listen to me.

737
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:57,380
有合適的  自己找一個
Find yourself a nice girl

738
01:21:57,380 --> 01:22:00,380
找一個領回來  讓媽看看
and bring her home to meet me.

739
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:09,890
可是  你爸不在了
Your father's gone.

740
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:13,390
你爸呀  就為你這事擔心
He used to worry about you.

741
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:20,900
兒女大了  拴不住了
Our children must leave home.

742
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:27,400
離爹娘遠了  就看不到了
We can't keep you here forever.

743
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:33,910
做父母的
As parents...

744
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:39,430
兒女出了門  父母都擔心吶  你看
we let you go, but we never stopped worrying.

745
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:44,920
你爸  一直
Your father...

746
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:50,430
都掛念你  記著你
...missed you so.

747
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:55,960
- 別哭了  媽    - 你看他
- Please don't cry.    - Your father...

748
01:22:56,070 --> 01:22:58,360
你老哭老哭  你看你這身體都壞了
Mother, please don't cry.

749
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:02,440
你看他去了  把咱們母子留下  孤孤單單的
With your father gone, it's hard not to feel lonely.

750
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:09,450
好了
I know.

751
01:23:13,450 --> 01:23:15,960
你呀
You...

752
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:19,960
在外面好好工作啊
...must work hard and make a good life.

753
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:03,000
能寫會算  是件好事  念

知今知古  知天知地
"Know the present, know the past."

759
01:24:24,030 --> 01:24:28,530
春夏秋冬  一年四季  念

我一大早就讓村長把學生們集合起來
I gathered the students early that morning.

766
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:55,560
我說我要給學生們上一節課
I told them I would teach them for one day.

767
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,560
村長問我為什麼
The mayor asked me why.

768
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:01,560
我說我是為了母親  也為了父親
I said it was for my mother and for my father too.

769
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,560
我就站在父親常站的那個地方
I stood in my father's place,

770
01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:07,570
父親在這兒站了一輩子
where he stood for so many years.

771
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:11,070
我想  此時此刻  父親一定能聽見
I felt sure he could hear my voice,

772
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:12,960
我和孩子們唸書的聲音吧
and those of the students.

773
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:19,080
我念的就是當年父親在開學第一天念的那篇課文
The book I am using is the same one he used that first day.

774
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,580
其實這不是正式的課文
It is not a textbook.

775
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:24,580
這是父親自己編的一段識字歌兒
