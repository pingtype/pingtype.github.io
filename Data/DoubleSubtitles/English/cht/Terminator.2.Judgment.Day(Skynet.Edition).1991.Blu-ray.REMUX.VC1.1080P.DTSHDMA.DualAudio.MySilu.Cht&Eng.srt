I don't like to see the patients disrupting their rooms like this.

100
00:15:28,297 --> 00:15:29,910

Withdraw 300 bucks.

138
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:15,422
來吧  寶貝
Come on, baby. Come on!

139
00:18:15,506 --> 00:18:17,758
- 好  - 成功了
- Yes! - Hey, it worked.

140
00:18:17,841 --> 00:18:21,512
好  賺到了  走
All right. Easy money. Come on!

141
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:26,141
輕而易舉
Yes! Piece of cake.

142
00:18:31,397 --> 00:18:34,525
- 她就是你媽?  - 是的
- Is that her? - Yes.

143
00:18:34,608 --> 00:18:36,443
她似乎很酷嘛
She's pretty cool, huh?

144
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:38,779
不  她是個神精病
No, she's a complete psycho.

145
00:18:38,862 --> 00:18:42,250
所以才被人關在精神病院
That's why she's at Pescadero. It's a mental institute.

146
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,810
她企圖炸毀一間電腦工廠
She tried to blow up a computer factory,

147
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,410
結果遭擊傷被捕
but got shot and arrested.

148
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,539
真糟
No shit.

149
00:18:49,248 --> 00:18:51,625
她是徹底的失敗者
She's a total loser.

150
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:54,461
走  咱們去花點錢
Come on. Let's go spend some money.

151
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,610
莎拉
Sarah.

152
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,451
莎拉  醒醒
Sarah, wake up.

153
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,251
凱爾
Kyle.

154
00:19:37,004 --> 00:19:38,297
你不是死了嗎?
You're dead.

155
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,424
我們的孩子呢?
Where's our son, Sarah?

156
00:19:41,425 --> 00:19:43,677
被他們帶走了
They took him away from me.

157
00:19:43,761 --> 00:19:46,972
- 他處在危險之中  - 我知道
- He's the target now. - I know.

158
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:49,099
他孤立無援  你要去保護他
He's all alone. You have to protect him.

159
00:19:49,183 --> 00:19:51,510
我知道
I know.

160
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,110
你教我怎麼辦
You tell me how I'm supposed to do that.

161
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,523
他對我沒有信心
He doesn't even believe me anymore.

162
00:19:56,607 --> 00:20:00,510
- 我已經失去他了  - 你有能力
- I've lost him. - You're strong, Sarah.

163
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,155
比你認為的更有力量
Stronger than you ever thought you could be.

164
00:20:04,198 --> 00:20:05,730
起來抗爭  戰士
On your feet, soldier!

165
00:20:07,743 --> 00:20:10,537
我愛你  莎拉  永遠愛你
I love you, Sarah. I always will.

166
00:20:12,831 --> 00:20:15,751
- 我需要你  - 我永遠在你左右
- I need you. - I'll always be with you.

167
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:22,610
還記得我的話嗎?
Remember the message?

168
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,210
一切尚未成為定局
The future is not set.

169
00:20:26,178 --> 00:20:29,765
未來仍可以自己去開創
There is no fate but what we make for ourselves.

170
00:20:49,743 --> 00:20:51,662
別離開我
Stay with me.

171
00:20:52,621 --> 00:20:55,499
留給世界的時間所剩無幾
There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.

172
00:21:02,673 --> 00:21:04,510
凱爾  別走
Kyle, don't go!

173
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,810
凱爾
Kyle.

174
00:22:30,469 --> 00:22:34,431
<i>我的眼睛</i>
<i>It's like a giant strobe light...</i>

175
00:22:34,514 --> 00:22:36,850
<i>感到一陣灼熱感</i>
<i>burning right through my eyes.</i>

176
00:22:40,854 --> 00:22:43,357
<i>但我似乎仍能看見</i>
<i>Somehow I can still see.</i>

177
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:51,156
<i>老天</i>
<i>Oh, God.</i>

178
00:22:54,493 --> 00:22:57,955
<i>你們知道我的夢境每晚都一樣</i>
<i>We know the dream's the same every night.</i>

179
00:22:58,038 --> 00:23:01,458
<i>- 何必要...  - 請繼續</i>
<i>- Why do I have to... - Please continue.</i>

180
00:23:05,128 --> 00:23:07,881
<i>孩子們像紙一樣的燃燒</i>
<i>Children look like burnt paper.</i>

181
00:23:09,508 --> 00:23:11,635
<i>一片漆黑</i>
<i>Black.</i>

182
00:23:11,718 --> 00:23:13,637
<i>無人倖免</i>
<i>Not moving.</i>

183
00:23:15,472 --> 00:23:17,891
<i>一切東西都被燒得面目全非</i>
<i>And then the blast wave hits them.</i>

184
00:23:27,192 --> 00:23:29,903
<i>像樹葉般四處散落</i>
<i>And they fly apart like leaves.</i>

185
00:23:31,655 --> 00:23:35,033
<i>你的夢把世界末日</i>
<i>Dreams of cataclysm, the end of the world...</i>

186
00:23:35,117 --> 00:23:37,035
<i>描述地很好</i>
<i>are very common.</i>

187
00:23:38,745 --> 00:23:43,000
<i>這不是夢  這場核戰是真的</i>
<i>It's not a dream, you moron. It's real.</i>

188
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:47,004
<i>- 我知道這一切將要發生  - 你的夢很有真實感</i>
<i>- I know the date it happens. - I'm sure it feels real to you.</i>

189
00:23:47,087 --> 00:23:49,589
<i>1997年8月29日那天</i>
<i>On August 29, 1997...</i>

190
00:23:49,673 --> 00:23:53,176
<i>你也會有完全一樣的感受</i>
<i>it's gonna feel pretty fuckin' real to you too!</i>

191
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,930
<i>沒有擦幾萬層防曬油的人都會很慘的</i>
<i>Anybody not wearing two-million sunblock is gonna have a real bad day.</i>

192
00:23:57,014 --> 00:23:58,932
<i>- 懂嗎?  - 別激動</i>
<i>- Get it? - Stop.</i>

193
00:23:59,016 --> 00:24:01,893
<i>你們無能為力</i>
<i>God, you think you're safe and alive.</i>

194
00:24:01,977 --> 00:24:04,271
<i>你們都會死掉</i>
<i>You're already dead. Everybody!</i>

00:24:04,354 --> 00:24:06,857
<i>聽好  你們都會死掉</i>

<i>這兒的一切將消失無蹤</i>
<i>This whole place, everything you see is gone!</i>

<i>You're the one living in the dream, 'cause I know it happens!</i>

198

<i>就"美夢"成真了</i>
<i>It happens!</i>

199
00:24:27,002 --> 00:24:30,005
我現在好多了  
I feel much better now.

200
00:24:30,088 --> 00:24:31,965
清醒了
Clearer.

201
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:34,843
沒錯  你最近的態度
Yes, your attitude has been...

202
00:24:34,926 --> 00:24:37,220
的確改善不少
much improved lately.

203
00:24:46,563 --> 00:24:49,066
你說我的生活應該有個目標
It's helped me to have a goal...

204
00:24:49,149 --> 00:24:52,319
找件我很希望做的事
something to look forward to.

205
00:24:52,402 --> 00:24:53,570
什麼事?
What is that?

206
00:24:53,653 --> 00:24:55,989
你說過
Well, you said...

207
00:24:56,073 --> 00:24:59,910
我的病情若有改善
that if I showed improvement after six months...

208
00:24:59,993 --> 00:25:02,662
你會送我到管理較松的醫院
you would transfer me to the minimum security wing...

209
00:25:02,746 --> 00:25:05,499
而且可以讓我會客
and I could have visitors.

210
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:11,171
現在已經過去六個月了
Well, it's been six months and...

211
00:25:12,297 --> 00:25:14,591
我很想見見我兒子
I was looking forward to seeing my son.

212
00:25:15,634 --> 00:25:17,094
我明白了
I see.

213
00:25:20,347 --> 00:25:24,518
咱們再談談你提到的終結者機器
Let's go back to what you were saying about those Terminator machines.

214
00:25:25,685 --> 00:25:29,064
你現在認為它們不存在了?
Now you think they don't exist?

215
00:25:29,147 --> 00:25:33,276
它們不存在  我現在知道了
They don't exist. I know that now.

216
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,530
你反覆提及砸爛過一個終結者
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one...

217
00:25:36,613 --> 00:25:38,698
那又怎麼解釋
in a hydraulic press.

218
00:25:40,075 --> 00:25:43,203
我若做過這事  應該會有證據留下
If I had, there would have been some evidence.

219
00:25:43,286 --> 00:25:45,705
他們應該會在那工廠找到殘骸
They would have found something at the factory.

220
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:47,874
我懂了
I see.

221
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:51,378
<i>你不認為電腦公司掩飾了一切?</i>
<i>So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?</i>

222
00:25:53,672 --> 00:25:56,550
<i>不  它們為何要如此?</i>
<i>No. Why would they?</i>

223
00:25:56,758 --> 00:25:59,886
- 換個位置  - 好
- Let's try a new position right there. - Okay.

224
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:04,437
所有感應系統運作正常

225
00:26:04,499 --> 00:26:06,495
對  這是新的零件

226
00:26:07,516 --> 00:26:09,489
線路有點故障

227
00:26:09,813 --> 00:26:11,314
戴森先生
Mr. Dyson?

228
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:15,819
材料小組準備要...
The materials team is running another...

229
00:26:15,902 --> 00:26:17,571
- 戴森先生  - 怎麼啦?
- Mr. Dyson. - Yes?

230
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:20,615
材料小組下午要做實驗
The materials team is running another series this afternoon.

231
00:26:20,699 --> 00:26:23,660
你得簽字同意
You have to sign for the... it.

232
00:26:23,743 --> 00:26:26,580
- 把"它"拿出來  - 好的  我懂了
- You have to sign it out. - Okay. I'll get it.

233
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,441
戴森先生
Listen, Mr. Dyson,

234
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:30,810
我知道我剛進公司
I know I haven't been here long,

235
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,590
但你是否可以告訴我...
but I was wondering if you know...

236
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,045
告訴你什麼?
Know what?

237
00:26:34,129 --> 00:26:36,760
你知不知道"它"是哪兒來的?
If you know where "it" came from.

238
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,610
我也問過這個問題  
I asked them the same question once.

239
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,210
他們的回答是
You know what they told me?

240
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,110
"別問"
Don't ask.

241
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,010
你好  戴森先生
Good morning, Mr. Dyson.

242
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,060
- 還好嗎?  - 還好
- How's it going? - Okay.

243
00:26:51,354 --> 00:26:54,274
插入鑰匙  左向  三
Insert key. Left on three.

244
00:26:54,357 --> 00:26:56,693
二  一  轉
Two, one, turn.

245
00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:01,510
- 你老婆孩子還好吧  - 很好  謝謝
- How are the wife and kids? - Great. Thanks.

246
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,310
好了
Here you go.

247
00:27:30,227 --> 00:27:33,271
你覺得如何  大夫?
So what do you think, Doctor?

248
00:27:34,147 --> 00:27:36,107
我有進步  是吧?
Haven't I shown improvement?

249
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:40,153
莎拉  問題是
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

250
00:27:41,238 --> 00:27:43,657
我知道你有多聰明
I know how smart you are.

251
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,784
你是挑我愛聽的講
You're just telling me what I want to hear.

252
00:27:46,826 --> 00:27:49,871
我認為你根本言不由衷
I don't think you really believe what you're telling me today.

253
00:27:49,955 --> 00:27:53,875
你想調到管理寬鬆的醫院  只是想逃
If I put you in minimum security, you'll just try to escape again.

254
00:27:58,713 --> 00:28:01,007
你得讓我看看我兒子
You have to let me see my son.

255
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:03,843
求求你
Please.

256
00:28:05,498 --> 00:28:06,488
求求你
Please.

257
00:28:07,806 --> 00:28:11,017
他有生命危險  他需要我幫助
He's in great danger. He's naked without me.

258
00:28:12,435 --> 00:28:13,895
讓我打個電話也行
If I could make a phone call...

259
00:28:13,979 --> 00:28:16,439
不行  一會兒也不行
I'm afraid not. Not for a while.

260
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:21,111
我別無選擇
I don't see any choice but to recommend to the review board...

261
00:28:21,194 --> 00:28:23,780
只好再關你半年
that you stay here for another six months.

262
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:30,245
我要殺了你  混蛋
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

263
00:28:31,288 --> 00:28:34,490
- 你這禽獸  - 抓住她
- You son of a bitch! - Get her off!

264
00:28:34,749 --> 00:28:37,510
給她打鎮靜劑
Ten CCs of sodium amobarbital, stat!

265
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,810
你們這些混蛋
You don't know what you're doing!

266
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,510
快拿藥來
Get some restraints in here now!

267
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:47,137
死到臨頭了還不覺悟
You don't know what you're doing!

268
00:28:50,974 --> 00:28:53,268
<i>真是個模範公民</i>
<i>Model citizen.</i>

269
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,790
"目標確認"

270
00:29:32,307 --> 00:29:35,018
你剛好錯過  15分鐘前他們剛走
You just missed him. He was here 15 minutes ago.

271
00:29:35,101 --> 00:29:38,270
- 他們好像要去加利瑞購物中心  - 對
- He was going to the galleria. - Yeah.

272
00:29:38,355 --> 00:29:39,910
加利瑞?
The galleria?

273
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,571
- 我去換些銅板  馬上回來  - 好
- I'm gonna get some quarters. I'll be back, all right? - Cool.

274
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:46,370
- 噢  不  - 小姑娘  你們認識約翰·康納嗎?
- Oh, no! - Girls, do you know John Connor?

275
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:47,490
不認識
No.

276
00:30:50,051 --> 00:30:52,804
嘿  你認識這個孩子嗎?
Hey, do you know this kid?

277
00:30:52,887 --> 00:30:55,056
不  我不認識他
Nah, I don't know him.

278
00:31:00,395 --> 00:31:02,772
- 約翰  - 現在不行
- John. - Not now.

279
00:31:02,856 --> 00:31:06,109
有個條子在找你  快瞧
There's this cop scoping for you. Check it out.

280
00:31:08,653 --> 00:31:10,572
- 他就在那邊  - 快溜
- He's right over there. - Split, man.

281
00:31:10,655 --> 00:31:13,116
- 快走  - 好
- Just go. - Yeah.

282
00:31:17,829 --> 00:31:19,080
你在找的人好像往那兒...
I saw that kid...

283
00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:36,347
嘿  你不能跑到這裏來
Hey! You're not supposed to be in here!

284
00:32:02,081 --> 00:32:03,010
趴下
Get down.

285
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,239
先生  你沒事吧?
Mister, are you all right?

286
00:33:17,407 --> 00:33:18,575
你沒事吧?
You all right?

287
00:33:33,881 --> 00:33:35,091
快啊
Come on!

288
00:34:14,964 --> 00:34:16,424
該死
Goddamn!

289
00:38:55,536 --> 00:38:58,247
靠到路邊  停車
Okay, time-out. Stop the bike.

290
00:38:58,331 --> 00:39:00,917
停下來
Time-out. Come on, stop the bike.

291
00:39:14,013 --> 00:39:16,724
天啊  別會錯意了
Holy shit. Now, don't take this the wrong way.

292
00:39:16,807 --> 00:39:19,185
- 你是終結者  對吧?  - 對
- You are a Terminator, right? - Yes.

293
00:39:19,268 --> 00:39:22,210
生化機械  模型101
Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.

294
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,490
不可能吧
No.

295
00:39:33,699 --> 00:39:35,618
好傢伙
Holy shit.

296
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,705
你真像真的人
You're really real.

297
00:39:39,789 --> 00:39:41,749
我是說
I mean...

298
00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:47,213
你骨子裏是機器人  對吧?
You're like a machine underneath, right?

299
00:39:47,296 --> 00:39:48,798
可外表是人形
But alive outside?

300
00:39:48,881 --> 00:39:50,800
內部是機械骨架
I'm a cybernetic organism.

301
00:39:50,883 --> 00:39:53,594
外部是真皮
Living tissue over metal endoskeleton.

302
00:40:08,401 --> 00:40:10,569
真帥
This is intense.

303
00:40:10,653 --> 00:40:13,447
約翰  清醒一下
Get a grip, John. Okay.

304
00:40:16,033 --> 00:40:18,160
你不是來殺我的
You're not here to kill me.

305
00:40:18,244 --> 00:40:22,206
這一點我知道  那你到底要怎樣?
I figured that part out for myself. So what's the deal?

306
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:24,370
我的任務是要保護你
My mission is to protect you.

307
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:28,010
是嗎?  誰派你來的?
Yeah? Who sent you?

308
00:40:28,921 --> 00:40:31,048
是你  35年後的你
You did. Thirty-five years from now...

309
00:40:31,132 --> 00:40:35,136
派我來保護現在的你
you reprogrammed me to be your protector here in this time.

310
00:40:35,219 --> 00:40:37,972
真深奧
Oh, this is deep.

311
00:41:00,411 --> 00:41:03,110
那傢伙跟你一樣是終結者?
So this other guy, he's a Terminator like you, right?

312
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:07,370
跟我不同  它是T-1000  是更先進的模型
Not like me. A T-1000, advanced prototype.

313
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:10,629
你是說它比你更先進?
Your mean more advanced than you are?

314
00:41:10,713 --> 00:41:15,217
- 對  它是特種合金製造  - 那是什麼意思?
- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy. - What the hell does that mean?

315
00:41:15,301 --> 00:41:19,555
- 液態金屬  - 我們去哪兒?
- Liquid metal. - Where are we going?

316
00:41:19,638 --> 00:41:22,975
你得立刻離開這座城市  這樣才能逃避它的追殺
We have to get out of the city immediately and avoid the authorities.

317
00:41:23,058 --> 00:41:26,150
我想回家去  收拾些東西再走
I gotta stop by my house. I wanna pick up some stuff.

318
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:30,649
否決  T-1000它一定會在那等你的
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely try to reacquire you there.

319
00:41:30,733 --> 00:41:33,486
- 你確定?  - 我確定
- You sure? - I would.

320
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,790
陶德和吉納會有危險
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

321
00:41:49,043 --> 00:41:50,503
我至少得警告他們
but I gotta warn 'em.

322
00:41:50,586 --> 00:41:52,963
可惡  你有銅板嗎?
Shit. You got a quarter?

323
00:42:01,722 --> 00:42:04,725
- 喂  <i>- 吉納  是我</i>
- Hello. <i>- Janelle, it's me.</i>

324
00:42:04,809 --> 00:42:07,186
- 約翰?  <i>- 一切都好嗎?</i>
- John? <i>- Is everything all right?</i>

325
00:42:07,269 --> 00:42:09,688
- 你們都沒事吧?  <i>- 當然  甜心  一切都很好</i>
- Are you guys okay? <i>- Sure, honey, everything's okay.</i>

326
00:42:09,772 --> 00:42:12,858
- 你沒事吧?  <i>- 我很好</i>
- Are you all right? <i>- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

327
00:42:12,942 --> 00:42:16,529
約翰  天晚了  我很擔心你
John, it's late. I was beginning to worry about you.

328
00:42:16,612 --> 00:42:19,323
你趕快回來  我們一起吃晚餐
If you hurry home, we can sit down and have dinner together.

329
00:42:19,406 --> 00:42:20,950
我正在煮牛肉呢
I'm making beef stew.

330
00:42:21,033 --> 00:42:23,290
不對勁  她對我從沒這麼好過
Somethings wrong. She's never this nice.

331
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:25,830
約翰  你在哪兒?
John? Where are you?

332
00:42:25,913 --> 00:42:28,791
那隻狗在鬼叫什麼勁?
What the hell is the goddamn dog barking at?

333
00:42:28,874 --> 00:42:32,127
閉嘴  你這一文不值的廢物
Hey, shut up, you worthless piece of shit!

334
00:42:32,211 --> 00:42:33,671
狗在吠叫
The dog's really barking.

335
00:42:33,754 --> 00:42:36,130
叫那小鬼把那雜種狗丟掉
You were gonna tell the kid to get rid of that mutt.

336
00:42:39,885 --> 00:42:42,638
約翰  天晚了  別害我擔心
John, it's late. Please don't make me worry.

337
00:42:42,721 --> 00:42:44,431
他已經在那裏了嗎?
Could he already be there?

338
00:42:45,558 --> 00:42:46,851
甜心  你沒事吧
Honey, are you okay?

339
00:42:46,934 --> 00:42:50,938
- 我在這兒  我沒事  <i>- 真的嗎?</i>
- I'm right here. I'm fine. <i>- Are you sure you're all right?</i>

340
00:42:51,021 --> 00:42:54,110
- 狗叫什麼名字?  - 麥克斯
- What's the dog's name? - Max.

341
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:56,777
吉納  伍飛怎麼了?
Hey, Janelle. What's wrong with Wolfie?

342
00:42:56,861 --> 00:42:59,446
我聽見它在叫  它沒事吧?
I can hear him barking. Is he okay?

343
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:03,250
伍飛很好  甜心  它很好
Wolfie's fine, honey. Wolfie's just fine.

344
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:04,810
你在哪兒?
Where are you?

345
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,310
你的養父母都死了
Your foster parents are dead.

346
00:43:45,701 --> 00:43:47,703
說清楚點
I need a minute here.

347
00:43:47,786 --> 00:43:52,124
你說這機器能模仿一切事物?
You're telling me that this thing can imitate anything it touches?

348
00:43:52,207 --> 00:43:55,127
只要它能接觸到的都行
Anything it samples by physical contact.

349
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:56,629
厲害
Get real.

350
00:43:56,712 --> 00:44:00,466
那它也能變成一包香煙?
It could disguise itself as a pack of cigarettes?

351
00:44:00,549 --> 00:44:02,510
不行  只能變成類似它大小的物體
No, only an object of equal size.

352
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:05,130
那為何不變成顆炸彈來殺我?
Why not just become a bomb or something to get me?

353
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:07,222
它無法變成很複雜的機器
It can't form complex machines.

354
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:09,490
像槍枝  炸藥  化學品等
Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.

355
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:13,103
但它可以變出一個固態金屬形狀
It doesn't work that way. But it can form solid metal shapes.

356
00:44:13,187 --> 00:44:16,231
- 像是什麼?  - 像刀  能刺的武器
- Like what? - Knives and stabbing weapons.

357
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:44,110
"麥克斯"

358
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,500
來自媽媽的信息
Messages from Mom.

359
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,732
這些是電視監視器照的
These were taken by a video surveillance camera...

360
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:19,319
1984年  在西城警局
at the West Highland Police Station in 1984.

361
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,879
那晚他殺了17名警察
He killed 17 police officers that night.

362
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:27,160
都是有家室的人
Men with families...

363
00:46:28,745 --> 00:46:30,163
有子女
children.

364
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,167
這是今天在一個購物中心照的
These were taken at a mall in Reseda...

365
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,461
就在今天
today.

366
00:46:37,629 --> 00:46:40,840
康納小姐  我們知道你認得此人
Miss Connor, we know you know who this guy is.

367
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,014
我還要告訴你  令郎也失蹤了
I just sat here and told you that your son is missing...

368
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:50,934
他的養父母雙雙遇害
that the foster parents have been murdered.

369
00:46:50,999 --> 00:46:53,059
我們知道此人涉有重嫌
We know this guy's involved.

370
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:57,148
此事你一點也不關心?  你關心嗎?
Doesn't that mean anything to you? Don't you care?

371
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:05,519
我們是在浪費時間  咱們走
We're wasting our time. Let's go.

372
00:47:05,779 --> 00:47:07,879
抱歉各位
Sorry, guys.

373
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:12,705
她越來越與現實生活脫節了
She's grown more disconnected from reality as time goes on.

374
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:14,999
恐怕她幫不了你們的忙
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

375
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:18,294
也許等她神智清醒時就可以了  我會通知你們的
If she clears at all and can give us anything, I'll call you.

376
00:47:18,378 --> 00:47:20,004
好吧
Sure.

377
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:23,095
道格  請帶她回房去
Douglas, take her back to her room, please.

378
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:24,300
是
Yes, sir.

379
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,971
我們走
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

380
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:30,098
好長一段時間
You see...

381
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:33,393
我們曾在尼加拉瓜或其他的地方待過
we spent a lot of time in Nicaragua and places like that.

382
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:38,982
她有陣子跟退役的綠色貝雷帽士兵混
For a while there, she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy...

383
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:40,441
弄了不少槍
running guns.

384
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:43,444
然後又找了些人
Then there were some other guys.

385
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:45,530
她向任何可以學習的人吸取經驗
She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from...

386
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:48,866
以便將我造就成偉大的軍事領袖
so she could teach me how to be this great military leader.

387
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:52,620
後來她被捕了
Then she gets busted.

388
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:56,332
我媽瘋狂的舉動把我也弄糊塗了
It's like, "Sorry, kid, your mom's a psycho. Didn't you know?"

389
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:02,463
好像她教我相信的一切是狗屎
Like everything I've been brought up to believe is all made-up bullshit.

390
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:04,519
我痛恨這一點
I hated her for that.

391
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:11,097
但她說的一切都是真的
But everything she said was true.

392
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,350
她知道的
She knew...

393
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:18,605
但沒人肯相信她
and nobody believed her...

394
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:22,275
連我在內
not even me.

395
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:26,112
我們得把她弄出醫院
Listen. We gotta get her out of there.

396
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:29,574
否決  T-1000精明狡猾
Negative. The T-1000's highest probability for success now...

397
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:32,702
現在可能已經變成莎拉·康納  等你去自投羅網
will be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.

398
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:34,871
那她會怎樣?
Great. What happens to her?

399
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:37,832
模仿的對象必須消滅
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.

400
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,169
糟了  你怎麼不早說?  我們得馬上走
Shit! Why didn't you tell me? We gotta go right now!

401
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:43,338
否決  這不是我任務的重點
Negative. It's not a mission priority.

402
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:45,590
但這是我的重點
Fuck you! She's a priority to me!

403
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:51,429
混蛋  你是怎麼回事?  救命
Goddamn it! What's your problem? Help!

404
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:53,306
這對我們的任務毫無用處
This does not help our mission.

405
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:55,850
救命  把這瘋子趕走
Get this psycho off of me! Help!

406
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,978
救命  救命呀  他要綁架我  把這瘋子趕走
I'm being kidnapped! Get this psycho off of me!

407
00:48:59,062 --> 00:49:00,104
放手
Let me go!

408
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:06,444
你為何那樣做?
Why did you do that?

409
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:08,446
因為你命令我"放手"
Because you told me to.

410
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,700
什麼?
What?

411
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:19,707
你得照我的話去做  對吧?
You have to do what I say?

412
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:22,001
那是我任務的一個最高原則
That's one of my mission parameters.

413
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:26,619
證明呀  用一隻腳站立
Prove it. Stand on one foot.

414
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,343
好
Yes!

415
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:36,140
真酷  只聽我命令的終結者
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

416
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:38,893
你沒事吧  孩子?
You okay, kid?

417
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,353
滾開  別煩我
Take a hike, bozo.

418
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:43,022
我們別插手啦
Let's get outta here, man.

419
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:45,059
去你的  混球
Fuck you, you little dipshit!

420
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:47,193
混球?
Dipshit?

421
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:51,489
把腳放下
Put your leg down.

422
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:56,411
- 你敢叫<i>我</i>混球  - 只是想幫忙
- Did you call <i>moi</i> a dipshit? - Just trying to help this punk.

423
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,830
給這小子點顏色瞧瞧
Grab this guy.

424
00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:01,669
放開我
Get him off of me!

425
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:03,793
現在誰是混球?
Now who's the dipshit...

426
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:05,670
- 你個草包  - 放手
- you jock douche bag? - Get off!

427
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,959
不
No.

428
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:17,223
把槍放下  快
Put the gun down now!

429
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:20,518
- 離開這兒  - 兄弟  咱們快走
- Get outta here! - Come on. Let's split!

430
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:29,402
天呀  你會把那人給殺了
You were gonna kill that guy!

431
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:31,654
當然  我是終結者
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

432
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:36,492
仔細聽我說  好嗎?
Listen to me very carefully, okay?

433
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:39,912
你現在不再是終結者  好嗎?
You're not a Terminator anymore, all right?

434
00:50:39,996 --> 00:50:42,415
聽懂了嗎?
You got that?

435
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:44,751
你就是不能隨便到處殺人
You just can't go around killing people.

436
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:45,877
為什麼?
Why?

437
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:49,005
什麼意思?  反正就是不行
What do you mean, why? 'Cause you can't.

438
00:50:49,059 --> 00:50:49,999
為什麼?
Why?

439
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:53,059
因為你就是不能  好嗎?  這件事你得信任我
Because you just can't, okay? Trust me on this.

440
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:02,393
我要去救我媽
Look. I'm gonna go get my mom.

441
00:51:02,477 --> 00:51:05,313
我命令你要協助我
I order you to help me.

442
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:35,296
莎拉·康納在這裏嗎?
You have a Sarah Connor here?

443
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:37,048
你來遲了  是嗎?
You're runnin' kind of late.

444
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,508
他們已經來了一個多小時
They've been in there for an hour.

445
00:53:39,592 --> 00:53:42,011
等一下  我替你通知
Hold on a second. I'll buzz you in.

446
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:47,725
你的朋友來了
Oh, here come your friends now.

447
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:52,873
- 葛蘭  要咖啡嗎?  - 不  謝了
- Gwen, you want some coffee? - No, thanks.

448
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:56,002

- How 'bout a beer? - Yeah, right.

449
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:23,239
- 我中獎了  - 那可真棒
- Hey, I got a full house. - That's good, Louis.

450
00:55:23,349 --> 00:55:25,448
我走運了
Must be my lucky day.

451
00:57:48,299 --> 00:57:50,759
你說得沒錯
You're right about number 24.

452
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:53,846
給24號病房增加藥劑量吧
Increase the medication to 250 milligrams.

453
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:56,239
- 還用同一種藥嗎?  - 對
- Same kind? - Mm-hmm.

454
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,949
你
You!

455
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:18,370
你弄斷我的手臂了
You broke my arm.

456
00:58:18,454 --> 00:58:21,248
人體內有215塊骨頭
There are 215 bones in the human body.

457
00:58:21,332 --> 00:58:23,918
不過是斷一根而已  不准動
That's one. Now, don't move.

458
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:29,016
"排水管洗潔劑  有毒"

459
00:58:29,879 --> 00:58:31,419
你想幹什麼?
What are you going to do?

460
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:37,181
我們停下來幹什麼?
Why do we stop now?

461
00:58:38,474 --> 00:58:42,269
你得保證絕不殺人  好嗎?
You gotta promise me you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

462
00:58:42,353 --> 00:58:44,939
- 好  - 你發誓
- Right. - Swear?

463
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:46,523
什麼?
What?

464
00:58:46,607 --> 00:58:49,693
舉手說  "我絕不殺人"
Just put up your hand and say, "I swear I won't kill anyone."

465
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:53,614
我發誓我不殺任何人
I swear I will not kill anyone.

466
00:58:53,999 --> 00:58:55,239
好  咱們走
All right. Let's go.

你在幹什麼?
What are you doing?

470
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:13,842
王八蛋  你開槍打我
You son of a bitch! You shot me!

471
00:59:15,636 --> 00:59:16,929
瘋子
Crazy bastard!

472
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:23,519
別再開槍了  別殺我
Don't shoot me again. Don't kill me.

473
00:59:27,019 --> 00:59:28,619
他死不了的
He'll live.

474
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:45,019
婊子養的
Son of a bitch!

475

大家別激動

There's no way, Connor. Let him go.

- Open the door. - It ain't gonna happen.

479
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:57,094
別緊張
Take it easy, Sarah.

480
00:59:57,177 --> 01:00:00,306
行不通的  我知道你不是殺手
It won't work. You're no killer. I don't believe you can do it.

481
01:00:00,389 --> 01:00:03,350
反正你們都得死  索大夫  你知道我很認真
You're already dead. Everybody dies. You know I believe it.

482
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:05,477
別跟我耍花招

趴下
Get down.

516
01:04:46,419 --> 01:04:47,319

Ready!

526
01:06:53,969 --> 01:06:54,919
約翰
John.

527
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:03,879
你來開
You, drive.

528
01:07:57,032 --> 01:07:59,242
甩掉他了  後面沒人
He's not back there. There's nobody behind us.

529
01:07:59,326 --> 01:08:01,319
- 你沒事吧?  - 沒事
- Are you all right? - Yeah.

530
01:08:03,719 --> 01:08:05,239
你看的到路?
Can you see anything?

531
01:08:06,019 --> 01:08:07,419
我看的一清二楚
I see everything.

532
01:08:07,969 --> 01:08:10,059
"路況能見度提升"

533
01:08:10,295 --> 01:08:11,719
酷
Cool.

534
01:08:15,509 --> 01:08:17,119
過來
Come here.

535
01:08:23,183 --> 01:08:24,935
我說過我沒事
I said I was okay.

536
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:28,897
約翰  你來找我真是愚蠢
John, it was stupid of you to go there.

537
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:32,108
你該有自知之明的
You have to be smarter than that.

538
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:33,819
你差點連命都送掉
You were almost killed.

539
01:08:34,919 --> 01:08:36,919
你到底在想什麼?
What were you thinking?

540
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:40,299
你不該冒險  為我也不行
You cannot risk yourself, even for me.

541
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:43,495
你的命太重要了
Do you understand? You're too important.

542
01:08:43,578 --> 01:08:46,248
你懂嗎?
Do you understand?

543
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,252
可是...
But...

544
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:55,632
我必須把你從那兒就出來  對不起
I had to get you out of that place. I'm sorry.

545
01:08:56,883 --> 01:08:59,261
我不需要你協助  我自有辦法
I didn't need your help. I can take care of myself.

546
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:08,103
你的眼睛怎麼了?
What's wrong with your eyes?

547
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:11,481
沒什麼
Nothing.

548
01:09:21,408 --> 01:09:23,869
你又是什麼來頭?
So, what's your story?

549
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:35,505
你沒事?
You okay?

550
01:09:35,589 --> 01:09:37,007
很好
Fine.

551
01:09:38,842 --> 01:09:42,178
這機車真不錯
Say, that's a nice bike.

552
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:06,369
輕點行嗎?  老粗
Watch it, lug nuts.

553
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:17,297
你知道自己在幹什麼嗎?
Listen, do you know what you're doing?

554
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:20,175
我對人體構造非常瞭解
I have detailed files on human anatomy.

555
01:10:21,092 --> 01:10:23,053
我想也是
I bet.

556
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:26,139
那使你更容易殺人  是吧?
Makes you a more efficient killer, right?

557
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:27,349
沒錯
Correct.

558
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:35,398
你被擊中時會痛嗎?
Does it hurt when you get shot?

559
01:10:36,441 --> 01:10:39,903
我感到受損  亦可稱為"疼痛"
I sense injuries. The data could be called "pain."

560
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,157
約翰  幫我調整燈光
John, help me with the light.

561
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,534
- 會痊瘉嗎?  - 會的
- Will these heal up? - Yes.

562
01:10:46,618 --> 01:10:50,519
那就好  你若不像人  對我們就沒用
Good. If you can't pass for human, you're not much good to us.

563
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:53,625
你能活多久?
How long do you live? I mean, last. Whatever.

564
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:57,003
我的電池可維持120年
A hundred and twenty years with my existing power cell.

565
01:10:57,087 --> 01:11:00,006
你能學習你電腦中還未輸入過的事嗎?
Can you learn stuff that you haven't been programmed with...

566
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:01,508
使你能夠
so you can be...

567
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:05,470
更像人類?
you know, more human...

568
01:11:05,553 --> 01:11:07,999
這樣你才不會像個傻蛋
and not such a dork all the time?

569
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:14,980
我的中央處理器是神經元處理器  也是學習型電腦
My CPU is a neural net processor, a learning computer.

570
01:11:15,063 --> 01:11:19,119
我們外出時天網會將開關設置為"只可讀取"
But Skynet presets the switch to read-only when we're sent out alone.

571
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:23,196
它不想讓你有其他思想?
Doesn't want you to do too much thinking, huh?

572
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,614
不可以
No.

573
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:28,451
能重新設定嗎?
Can we reset the switch?

574
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:50,932
把轉子逆時針轉動
Rotate the two locking cylinders counterclockwise.

575
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:58,314
動手
Do it.

576
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:08,950
把蓋子扭開
Now open the port cover.

577
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:14,039
用力拔出來
Pull to break the seal.

578
01:12:17,167 --> 01:12:21,171
現在把芯片取出來
Good, now remove the shock-damping assembly.

579
01:12:24,716 --> 01:12:27,886
可以看到中央處理器了
You can now access the CPU.

580
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:30,346
- 看見了嗎?  - 看見了
- Do you see it? - Yes.

581
01:12:30,419 --> 01:12:32,619
鉗住處理器突起部分
Hold the CPU by its base tab.

582
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:34,219
"槽口打開"

583
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:35,852
拔出來
Pull.

584
01:13:13,223 --> 01:13:14,933
看見開關了嗎?
Do you see the pin switch?

585
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:16,893
不要
No! No!

586
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:20,522
- 與你無關  - 別毀滅他
- Out of my way, John. - Don't kill him.

587
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:23,900
是"它"  不是"他"  "它"
It, John, not him. It.

588
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:27,445
好的  是"它"  但我們需要"它"
Okay, it. But we need it.

589
01:13:27,529 --> 01:13:30,156
好好聽我說
Listen to me. You listen.

590
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,367
依靠自己的力量比較好
We're better off on our own.

591
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:34,244
可他是證據
But he's the only proof we have...

592
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:36,830
是戰爭以及未來之事的唯一證據
of the future and the war and all that.

593
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:38,289
也許
Maybe.

594
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:42,961
可我始終信不過它
I don't trust it.

595
01:13:43,044 --> 01:13:44,754
他是我的朋友  對吧?
But he's my friend, all right?

596
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:48,341
你根本不知道"它"到底要殺誰
You don't know what it's like to try to kill one of these things...

597
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:52,011
為了以防萬一  這是最後機會  動手吧
and if something goes wrong this could be our last chance, so move!

598
01:13:52,095 --> 01:13:54,180
如果我真是未來領袖
If I'm ever supposed to be this great military leader...

599
01:13:54,264 --> 01:13:58,101
那你總該聽一次領袖的意見吧?
maybe you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.

600
01:14:00,639 --> 01:14:02,639
如果親生母親都不聽我的話
Because if my own mother won't,

601
01:14:02,919 --> 01:14:05,319
那又怎能指望別人?
how do you expect anyone else to?

602
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:23,001
好吧  聽你的吧
All right, play it your way.

603
01:14:27,419 --> 01:14:28,919
"系統中斷"

604
01:14:29,019 --> 01:14:30,319
"診斷"

605
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,510
有問題嗎?
Was there a problem?

606
01:14:32,594 --> 01:14:34,095
沒問題
No problem.

607
01:14:35,719 --> 01:14:37,239
即便有  我也擺平了
None whatsoever.

608
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:12,592
現在開始學習吧
Are we learning yet?

609
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:27,982
我們得盡量遠離這座城市
We have to get as far away from the city as possible.

610
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:33,321
往南走
Just head south.

611
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,665
時速別超過65英里
Keep it under 65.

612
01:15:43,748 --> 01:15:46,751
- 否則會被交警攔下  - 確認
- We don't want to be pulled over. - Affirmative.

613
01:15:47,519 --> 01:15:48,819
不  不不
No, no, no.

614
01:15:49,963 --> 01:15:52,465
你得學人類說話的方式
You gotta listen to the way people talk.

615
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:56,052
你不能說"確認"那種鳥話
You don't say "affirmative" or some shit like that.

616
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:58,471
你要說  <i>"沒問題"</i>
You say, <i>"No problemo."</i>

617
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:02,475
如果有人找碴  你就說  "有種試試看"
If someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say, "Eat me."

618
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:06,854
如果要解決掉他們  就說<i>"拜拜了  寶貝"</i>
And if you want to shine them on, it's <i>"Hasta la vista, baby."</i>

619
01:16:07,419 --> 01:16:09,519
拜拜了  寶貝
Hasta la vista, baby.

620
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:12,193
對  或者說  "去死吧  精蟲"
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."

621
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:15,321
有人生氣  你就說  "冷靜點"
If someone gets upset, you say, "Chill out."

622
01:16:15,405 --> 01:16:16,781
或者你也可以自由發揮
Or you can do combinations.

623
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:19,867
冷靜點  精蟲
Chill out, dick-wad.

624
01:16:20,702 --> 01:16:22,704
對  看  你真的會了
That's great. See? You're getting it.

625
01:16:23,013 --> 01:16:23,989
沒問題
No problemo.

626
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:36,801
你身上帶錢了嗎?
You got any cash?

627
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:40,430
有幾百塊  分你一半
I got a couple hundred bucks. I'll give you half.

628
01:16:40,479 --> 01:16:41,519
媽
Mom!

629
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:45,239
我去買點吃的
Get some food.

630
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:49,772
一點幽默感都沒有
No sense of humor.

631
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:58,781
還有件事  你要放鬆點
That's another thing. You can lighten up a bit yourself.

632
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:01,868
一本正經已經很老土了
This severe routine is getting old, okay.

633
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:03,786
你得這學著風趣一點
I mean, you're acting like such a geek.

634
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:05,872
時常微笑一下
Smile once in a while.

635
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:07,290
微笑
Smile?

636
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:11,294
對  微笑  看著
Yeah, you know, smile. Watch.

637
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:16,007
嗨  真是個好地方  生意不錯吧?
Hi. Nice place you got here. How's business?

638
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:18,801
別搗亂
Give me a break.

639
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:21,721
演砸了
Okay, bad example.

640
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:24,515
看見那個小伙子了嗎?
See that guy over there?

641
01:17:24,599 --> 01:17:26,476
那就是微笑
That's a smile.

642
01:17:28,819 --> 01:17:30,019
"動作選擇"

643
01:17:30,269 --> 01:17:35,969
"分析"

644
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:47,288
不錯
That's good.

645
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:50,333
找個鏡子多練習一下吧
Maybe you could practice in front of a mirror or something.

646
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:59,509
要吃點薯條嗎?
Want some of my fries?

647
01:18:09,519 --> 01:18:11,979
- 你需要幫忙嗎?  - 不用
- Need any help? - No.

648
01:18:12,699 --> 01:18:14,519
- 我殺死你了  - 不  你沒有
- I got you! - No, you didn't!

649
01:18:14,619 --> 01:18:16,759
- 你死了  - 才沒有呢
- I got you! - No, you didn't!

650
01:18:21,519 --> 01:18:23,019
去你的  混球
I got you!

651
01:18:23,491 --> 01:18:26,494
我們撐不過去  對吧
We're not gonna make it, are we?

652
01:18:28,538 --> 01:18:29,747
我是指人類
People, I mean.

653
01:18:32,917 --> 01:18:34,999
你們天性便有自我毀滅傾向
It's in your nature to destroy yourselves.

654
01:18:35,837 --> 01:18:38,756
對  真無聊  是吧?
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

655
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:42,093
快住手  要不掐斷你們脖子
Break it up before I wring both of your necks.

656
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:46,973
我要知道"天網"系統的起源
I need to know how Skynet gets built.

657
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:48,307
是誰研究出來的?
Who's responsible?

658
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:51,936
直接負責的人是莫斯·戴森
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennett Dyson.

659
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:53,729
誰呀?
Who is that?

660
01:18:53,813 --> 01:18:57,733
塞柏電腦公司特別企劃室主任
He's the director of special projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

661
01:19:00,528 --> 01:19:02,280
為何是他?
Why him?

662
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:05,879
數月內他會研製出新型微電腦
In a few months, he creates a revolutionary type of microprocessor.

663
01:19:06,784 --> 01:19:08,419
然後呢?
Go on. Then what?

664
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:12,165
三年內塞柏會成為軍方電腦來源
In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier...

665
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:13,999
負責高階研發
of military computer systems.

666
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:17,628
所有轟炸機都會裝載塞柏的電腦系統
All Stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers...

667
01:19:17,712 --> 01:19:19,172
成為無人操作機型
becoming fully unmanned.

668
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:22,300
然後它創造了完美的運作記錄
Afterwards they fly with a perfect operational record.

669
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:25,011
天網計劃法案正式通過
The Skynet funding bill is passed.

670
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:28,389
1997年8月4日  電腦系統上線
The system goes on-line on August 4, 1997.

671
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:31,642
它迅速掌握戰略防衛系統
Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.

672
01:19:31,726 --> 01:19:34,437
天網電腦以極快速度吸取經驗
Skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate.

673
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:39,319
它產生自我意識  時間為8月29日上午2時14分
It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29.

674
01:19:39,901 --> 01:19:42,486
人類驚慌失措  準備應變
In a panic, they try to pull the plug.

675
01:19:43,613 --> 01:19:45,865
- 但天網卻先發制人  - 是的
- Skynet fights back. - Yes.

676
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:48,701
它向俄羅斯境內目標發射飛彈
It launches its missiles against the targets in Russia.

677
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:51,829
為何攻擊俄國?  他們現在不是我們的朋友嗎?
Why attack Russia? Aren't they our friends now?

678
01:19:51,913 --> 01:19:56,419
天網知道俄方反擊便可消滅美國
Skynet knows the Russian counterattack will eliminate its enemies over here.

679
01:19:56,519 --> 01:19:57,999
天啦
Jesus.

680
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:02,879
你對戴森瞭解多少?
How much do you know about Dyson?

681
01:20:04,717 --> 01:20:06,636
我有他的詳細資料
I have detailed files.

682
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:09,805
我要知道一切
I want to know everything.

683
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:15,102
他的長相  住址  一切
What he looks like, where he lives, everything.

684
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:28,157
莫斯
Miles.

685
01:20:30,576 --> 01:20:32,536
<i>莫斯</i>
<i>Miles.</i>

686
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:52,181
你打算工作一整天嗎?
Are you going to work all day?

687
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:56,143
對不起  這玩意兒很傷腦筋
I'm sorry, baby. But this thing is just kicking my ass.

688
01:20:56,227 --> 01:20:57,520
今天是禮拜天
Miles, it's Sunday.

689
01:20:57,603 --> 01:21:00,356
你答應帶孩子去水上樂園的
You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.

690
01:21:01,941 --> 01:21:03,442
不行吧
I can't...

691
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:05,820
我忙死了
I'm on a roll.

692
01:21:18,666 --> 01:21:20,876
親愛的  這東西面世後會轟動全球的
Baby, this is going to blow them all away.

693
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:24,046
- 神經元處理器  - 你說過的
- It's a neural net processor. - I know. You told me.

694
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:27,319
這是神經元處理器  可以像人類一樣思考
It's a neural net processor. It thinks and learns like we do.

695
01:21:27,369 --> 01:21:30,052
是常溫條件下的超導體
It's superconducting at room temperature.

696
01:21:30,136 --> 01:21:34,390
其他電腦就像計算器一樣弱智
Other computers are just pocket calculators by comparison.

697
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:38,561
真的這麼重要嗎?
But why is that so goddamn important, Miles?

698
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:39,979
我真的想知道
I really need to know...

699
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:43,149
有時候我真的要瘋了
because sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy here.

700
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:46,819
親愛的  我快成功了
Baby, I am this close.

701
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:48,946
過來
Come here.

702
01:21:51,574 --> 01:21:54,076
想像一下  一架噴氣機
Imagine a jet airliner...

703
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:56,829
上面的機師永不疲倦  永不出錯
with a pilot that never gets tired, never makes mistakes...

704
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:58,999
不會像個醉貓跑來上班
never shows up to work with a hangover.

705
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:03,586
來見過這位機師
Meet the pilot.

706
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:06,756
我們為什麼要結婚?  為什麼要生孩子?
Why did we get married, Miles? Why did we have these children?

707
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:07,882
你根本不需要我們
You don't need us.

708
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:11,385
你的身心全在這裏
Your heart and your mind are in here.

709
01:22:11,469 --> 01:22:14,479
可這東西不會像我們一樣愛你
But it doesn't love you like we do.

710
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:25,149
我很抱歉  真的
I'm sorry. Really.

711
01:22:25,232 --> 01:22:29,487
帶孩子們出去玩吧
How about spending some time with your other babies?

712
01:22:32,156 --> 01:22:33,991
<i>水上樂園</i>
<i>Raging Waters!</i>

713
01:23:03,646 --> 01:23:05,419
在車上等著
Wait in the car.

714
01:23:43,811 --> 01:23:45,879
你真性急  康納
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

715
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:49,029
你也是
You too.

716
01:24:06,417 --> 01:24:08,169
約翰
Hey, big John.

717
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:09,920
你好
What's up?

718
01:24:10,019 --> 01:24:11,419
他是誰?
Who is this guy?

719
01:24:11,519 --> 01:24:13,507
他沒問題  他跟我來的
He's cool, Enrique. He's with me.

720
01:24:13,591 --> 01:24:16,760
他是  包伯叔
He's... Uncle Bob.

721
01:24:16,844 --> 01:24:19,054
包伯叔  這是恩裏克
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

722
01:24:19,138 --> 01:24:20,890
包伯叔?
Uncle Bob, huh?

723
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:23,999
好吧  自己人
Okay.

724
01:24:30,219 --> 01:24:31,419
要喝嗎?
Drink?

725
01:24:36,614 --> 01:24:38,032
包伯叔?
"Uncle Bob"?

726
01:24:40,034 --> 01:24:42,828
你們很有名  都上了電視
You're pretty famous, all over the goddamn TV.

727
01:24:42,912 --> 01:24:45,581
條子就像瘋狗似的
Pictures of you, John, your big friend here.

728
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:47,625
想揪你們出來呢
Cops are going nuts looking for you.

729
01:24:51,545 --> 01:24:55,507
我需要衣物  食物  和一輛卡車
I just came for my stuff. I need clothes, food and a truck.

730
01:24:55,519 --> 01:24:57,819
要不要我連假牙都一起給你?
How about the fillings in my teeth?

731
01:24:57,919 --> 01:25:00,019
現在就要
Now, Enrique.

732
01:25:01,222 --> 01:25:03,699
你們也去  去拿武器
You two, you're on weapons detail.

733
01:25:04,095 --> 01:25:05,184
走吧
Come on, let's go.

734
01:25:25,788 --> 01:25:27,706
我媽有個特點
One thing about my mom...

735
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,961
她總是未雨綢繆
she always plans ahead.

736
01:25:42,619 --> 01:25:43,847
好極了
Excellent.

737
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:58,153
這是最好的車  但缺起動馬達
This is my best truck, but the starter motor's gone.

738
01:25:58,237 --> 01:26:00,155
你有時間等它裝好嗎?
You got time to change it out?

739
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:03,575
- 可以  我要等午夜之後再越過邊境  - 那好
- Yeah. I'm gonna wait till dark to cross the border. - Okay.

740
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:05,160
恩裏克
Enrique.

741
01:26:05,244 --> 01:26:08,999
這裏很危險  今晚你也得離開
It's dangerous for you here. You get out tonight too, okay?

742
01:26:09,059 --> 01:26:10,759
好的
Sure.

743
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:15,296
我早把生死置之度外
Just drop by anytime and totally fuck up my life, all right?

744
01:26:19,717 --> 01:26:23,178
我在這種地方長大
See, I grew up in places like this...

745
01:26:23,262 --> 01:26:25,681
我還以為人就是這樣過活
so I just thought that's how people lived...

746
01:26:27,016 --> 01:26:29,727
駕駛著直升機
riding around in helicopters...

747
01:26:30,811 --> 01:26:33,022
學習如何炸東西
learning how to blow shit up.

748
01:26:34,523 --> 01:26:37,192
我媽媽被捕後
But then when my mom got busted...

749
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:39,653
我被送進學校
I got put into a regular school.

750
01:26:40,321 --> 01:26:43,073
發現其他孩子都在玩任天堂
All the other kids were into Nintendo.

751
01:26:57,338 --> 01:26:59,465
你害怕過嗎?
Are you ever afraid?

752
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:00,841
沒有
No.

753
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,513
也沒怕過死?
Not even of dying?

754
01:27:07,056 --> 01:27:08,519
沒有
No.

755
01:27:13,354 --> 01:27:17,419
你對死亡從來都無動於衷?
You don't feel any emotion about it, one way or another?

756
01:27:17,619 --> 01:27:21,719
是的  任務完成前  我得保持機體穩定運行
No. I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.

757
01:27:26,658 --> 01:27:29,787
所以死不足懼
Then it doesn't matter.

758
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:33,582
我也得保持穩定  "我太重要了"
I have to stay functional too. "I'm too important."

759
01:27:49,848 --> 01:27:51,725
很適合你
That's definitely you.

760
01:28:02,479 --> 01:28:05,879
與我媽來往的男人都是怪人
Most of the guys my mom hung around with were geeks...

761
01:28:06,115 --> 01:28:09,618
但有個傢伙倒很酷
but there was this one guy, he was kinda cool.

762
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:11,620
他教我玩這些
He taught me engines.

763
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:13,872
撐住這兒
Hold here.

764
01:28:13,956 --> 01:28:16,375
後來他們還是分手了
Mom screwed it up, of course.

765
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:18,877
她總是在談審判日等等之類的話題
She'd always tell 'em about Judgment Day...

766
01:28:18,961 --> 01:28:21,755
也許直到今天
and me being this world leader.

767
01:28:21,839 --> 01:28:23,799
她腦裏仍只想這一件事
That'd be all she wrote.

768
01:28:25,134 --> 01:28:26,519
請把鉗子給我
Torque wrench, please.

769
01:28:28,419 --> 01:28:29,419
拿去
Here.

770
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:32,919
真希望能見到我生父
I wish I could've met my real dad.

771
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:34,759
你會的
You will.

772
01:28:34,935 --> 01:28:37,104
對
Yeah, I guess.

773
01:28:37,187 --> 01:28:40,519
那時我已經45歲了
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

774
01:28:41,108 --> 01:28:44,820
我會派他回到1984年
They sent him back through time to 1984.

775
01:28:44,903 --> 01:28:46,321
天啦
Man.

776
01:28:47,865 --> 01:28:50,325
他現在還沒出生呢
He hasn't even been born yet.

777
01:28:52,119 --> 01:28:54,037
真不可思議
It messes with your head.

778
01:28:56,790 --> 01:28:59,710
- 把螺絲帽給我  - 給
- The other bolt. - Oh. Here.

779
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:09,595
她只和他共處了一個晚上
Mom and him were only together for one night.

780
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:12,139
我想她仍愛著他
She still loves him, I guess.

781
01:29:12,222 --> 01:29:15,100
有時我看見她在哭
I see her crying sometimes.

782
01:29:15,184 --> 01:29:19,188
當然啦  她完全否認  她說那是有異物吹進眼裏
She denies it totally, of course, like she got something stuck in her eye.

783
01:29:24,151 --> 01:29:25,569
你們為何哭泣?
Why do you cry?

784
01:29:26,778 --> 01:29:28,280
- 你是說人類?  - 對
- You mean people? - Yeah.

785
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:29,740
我不知道
I don't know.

786
01:29:29,823 --> 01:29:31,909
他們就是會哭
We just cry...

787
01:29:31,992 --> 01:29:34,536
尤其是"傷心"的時候
you know, when it hurts.

788
01:29:40,626 --> 01:29:42,377
是"傷"造成的?
Pain causes it?

789
01:29:43,462 --> 01:29:45,589
不  那不一樣
No. It's different.

790
01:29:45,672 --> 01:29:48,967
雖然你沒事  但傷心時就會哭
It's when there's nothing wrong with you, but you hurt anyway.

791
01:29:49,051 --> 01:29:50,636
- 懂嗎?  - 不懂
- You get it? - No.

792
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:53,597
那才像話
All right, my man!

793
01:29:54,019 --> 01:29:55,119
沒問題
No problemo.

794
01:29:55,432 --> 01:29:57,059
擊掌慶祝
Give me five.

795
01:29:59,102 --> 01:30:01,319
像這樣撐開手掌  來
Just put out your hand like this, come on.

796
01:30:02,564 --> 01:30:06,902
很好  拍打我的手  該你了  你來擊掌
All right! Now hit me. Give me five. Do the same thing.

797
01:30:06,992 --> 01:30:07,968
很好
All right!

798
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:14,076
好  很好  來個高的
Okay, that's good. Up high.

799
01:30:15,019 --> 01:30:16,019
低的
Five low.

800
01:30:16,879 --> 01:30:18,159
你慢了
Too slow.

801
01:30:21,083 --> 01:30:23,335
我是在開玩笑  再來一次
I'm just kidding. One more time.

802
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:25,629
很好  接著來
Good. Now try it.

803
01:30:25,712 --> 01:30:27,673
來  打我一掌
Now do me. Give me five.

804

- She'll meet you tomorrow. - Mom!

821
01:34:46,806 --> 01:34:47,974
媽等等
Mom, wait!

822
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:04,699
"不是命運"
"No fate."

823
01:35:05,909 --> 01:35:08,370
命運是要自己開創的
No fate but what we make.

824
01:35:10,497 --> 01:35:12,499
我的父親告訴她的
My father told her this.

825
01:35:15,043 --> 01:35:19,339
是未來的我讓我父親告訴她的
I made him memorize it in the future as a message to her.

826
01:35:21,007 --> 01:35:22,926
算了
Never mind.

827
01:35:23,009 --> 01:35:26,346
整件事就是這樣
Okay, the whole thing goes...

828
01:35:26,429 --> 01:35:29,140
一切尚未成為定局
The future's not set.

829
01:35:29,224 --> 01:35:32,727
未來仍可以自己去開創
There's no fate but what we make for ourselves.

830
01:35:32,811 --> 01:35:35,814
她想改變未來?
She intends to change the future.

831
01:35:35,897 --> 01:35:37,357
對  我猜也是
Yeah, I guess.

832
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,735
糟了
Oh, shit!

833
01:35:40,819 --> 01:35:42,737
- 戴森  - 對
- Dyson. - Yeah.

834
01:35:42,821 --> 01:35:46,324
一定是的  莫斯·戴森
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

835
01:35:46,408 --> 01:35:48,410
她想要殺了戴森
She's gonna blow him away.

836
01:35:48,493 --> 01:35:50,579
來  咱們走
Come on! Let's go!

837
01:35:50,967 --> 01:35:51,950
快啊
Come on!

838
01:36:02,966 --> 01:36:05,010
事實上  這樣做非常危險
This is tactically dangerous.

839
01:36:05,093 --> 01:36:06,219
開快點
Drive faster.

840
01:36:06,303 --> 01:36:08,805
T-1000跟我一樣瞭解情況
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.

841
01:36:08,888 --> 01:36:12,309
它知道我知道的一切  它還能預測敵人的行動
It knows what I know. It might anticipate this move.

842
01:36:12,392 --> 01:36:14,519
我不管  咱們得阻止她
I don't care. We gotta stop her.

843
01:36:14,978 --> 01:36:17,059
殺死戴森的確有可能阻止戰爭
Killing Dyson might prevent the war.

844
01:36:17,159 --> 01:36:20,919
我不管  你還沒學通嗎?
I don't care! Haven't you learned anything yet?

845
01:36:20,999 --> 01:36:23,719
你還不明白為何不能亂殺人嗎?
Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?

846
01:36:26,531 --> 01:36:29,034
聽著  也許你不在乎生死
Look, maybe you don't care if you live or die...

847
01:36:29,117 --> 01:36:31,286
可並非所有人都這樣
but everybody's not like that.

848
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:34,956
人類有感情  會受到傷害  會感到恐懼
We have feelings. We hurt. We're afraid.

849
01:36:37,459 --> 01:36:41,059
這種東西你要理解  我不是開玩笑  真的很重要
You got to learn this stuff. I'm not kidding. It's important.

850
01:37:18,792 --> 01:37:21,419
丹尼  叫你去睡覺  我說真的
Danny, I told you to go to bed, like your sister.

851
01:37:21,519 --> 01:37:24,239
再玩一會兒就好  媽
Just a couple of minutes, Mom!

852
01:37:41,022 --> 01:37:43,358
丹尼  睡覺時間到了
Danny, your time is up!

853
01:37:43,441 --> 01:37:46,361
快刷牙上床
Come brush your teeth and get to bed.

854
01:38:15,019 --> 01:38:16,019
丹尼
Danny.

855
01:38:28,095 --> 01:38:29,159
爸
Daddy!

856
01:38:29,571 --> 01:38:32,073
這不是遊戲  快逃
Danny, go! Go!

857
01:38:33,819 --> 01:38:34,819
莫斯
Miles.

858
01:38:40,039 --> 01:38:42,459
- 特瑞莎  跑  - 我的天啊
- Tarissa, run! - Oh, my God!

859
01:38:49,549 --> 01:38:51,593
快帶丹尼走  快逃
Just take Danny and run!

860
01:38:51,676 --> 01:38:52,927
快逃
Run!

861
01:38:53,011 --> 01:38:54,763
我的天呀
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

862
01:39:13,656 --> 01:39:14,657
爹地
Daddy!

863
01:39:14,819 --> 01:39:15,819
丹尼
Danny.

864
01:39:16,367 --> 01:39:17,827
誰都不許動
Nobody fucking move!

865
01:39:18,661 --> 01:39:19,913
別傷害我爸
Don't hurt my daddy!

866
01:39:19,996 --> 01:39:21,539
趴到地上
On the floor, bitch.

867
01:39:21,623 --> 01:39:23,519
趴下
Get down now!

868
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:25,752
讓開
Get out of the way!

869
01:39:25,835 --> 01:39:27,295
別傷害他
Don't hurt him!

870
01:39:28,797 --> 01:39:30,799
讓開  否則我開槍
Get on the floor now!

871
01:39:33,843 --> 01:39:35,553
饒了孩子吧
Just let the boy go.

872
01:39:35,637 --> 01:39:37,222
你閉嘴
Shut up. Shut up.

873
01:39:37,305 --> 01:39:38,598
閉嘴
Shut up!

874
01:39:38,681 --> 01:39:41,267
都是你的錯  混蛋
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

875
01:39:41,351 --> 01:39:43,603
- 都是你的錯  - 什麼?
- It's all your fault! - What?

876
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:45,814
我不會讓你得逞的
I'm not gonna let you do it.

877
01:40:37,824 --> 01:40:39,909
糟了  太遲了
Shit! We're too late!

878
01:40:44,414 --> 01:40:45,540
看看他們
Check them.

879
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:51,212
看著我  媽
Look at me, Mom.

880
01:40:51,296 --> 01:40:53,506
你受傷了?
Are you hurt?

881
01:40:53,976 --> 01:40:54,955
看著我
Look at me.

882
01:40:57,135 --> 01:40:59,220
我幾乎
I almost...

883
01:40:59,819 --> 01:41:01,019
我下不了手
I almost...

884
01:41:10,857 --> 01:41:13,192
放心吧
It'll be okay.

885
01:41:13,276 --> 01:41:15,236
一定還有辦法的  真的
We'll figure something out. Okay?

886
01:41:16,821 --> 01:41:18,448
相信我吧
I promise.

887
01:41:21,743 --> 01:41:24,704
你是來阻止我的?
You came here to stop me.

888
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:27,540
對
Yeah, I did.

889
01:41:30,418 --> 01:41:32,420
我愛你  約翰
I love you, John.

890
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:35,673
我一直愛著你
I always have.

891
01:41:37,592 --> 01:41:39,010
我知道
I know.

892
01:41:46,017 --> 01:41:48,227
子彈貫穿
Deep penetration.

893
01:41:49,812 --> 01:41:51,731
沒有擊碎骨頭
No shattered bone.

894
01:41:51,814 --> 01:41:54,776
把傷口壓著就能止住血了
Hold here. The pressure should stop the bleeding.

895
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:06,955
你們是誰?
Who are you people?

896
01:42:07,914 --> 01:42:09,332
告訴他
Show him.

897
01:42:12,001 --> 01:42:16,172
丹尼  你跟我走好嗎?  帶我看看你房間
Danny, I want you to come with me right now. Show me your room.

898
01:42:56,671 --> 01:42:57,880
我的天呀
Oh, my God.

899
01:42:57,964 --> 01:43:00,633
仔細聽我說
Now listen to me very carefully.

900
01:43:06,514 --> 01:43:10,643
<i>戴森聽著終結者的解說</i>
<i>Dyson listened while the Terminator laid it all down.</i>

01:43:10,727 --> 01:43:14,605
<i>天網  審判日</i>
<i>Skynet. Judgment Day.</i>

<i>The history of things to come.</i>

01:43:18,401 --> 01:43:21,154
<i>知道自己的研發成果最終將會</i>
<i>It's not every day that you find out you're responsible...</i>

904
01:43:21,237 --> 01:43:24,073

<i>He took it pretty well.</i>

我想我要嘔吐了
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

You're judging me...

我還未做的事懲罰我?
on things I haven't even done yet.

909
01:43:45,428 --> 01:43:47,555
我怎會知道?
How were we supposed to know?

910
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:51,699
對
Yeah.

911
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:53,879
沒錯
Right.

912
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,647
你怎會知道?
How were you supposed to know?

913
01:43:57,690 --> 01:44:01,402
氫彈就是你這種人發明的
Fucking men like you built the hydrogen bomb.

01:44:01,486 --> 01:44:04,072
也是你這種人
Men like you...

引爆它的
thought it up.

916
01:44:09,452 --> 01:44:11,412
你以為你很有創造力
You think you're so creative.

917
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:15,917
你根本就不知道創造的意義
You don't know what it's like to really create something...

918
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,127
創造生命
to create a life...

919
01:44:18,211 --> 01:44:19,754
是感覺它在體內成長
to feel it growing inside you.

920
01:44:19,837 --> 01:44:22,757
你只會創造死亡和毀滅
All you know how to create is death and destruction.

921
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:24,509
媽
Mom!

922
01:44:24,592 --> 01:44:28,346
你得說些有建設性的話  好嗎?
We need to be a little more constructive here. Okay?

923
01:44:28,429 --> 01:44:30,879
我們仍要阻止戰爭的  對吧?
We still have to stop this from happening, don't we?

924
01:44:30,999 --> 01:44:33,434
但我以為
But I thought...

925
01:44:33,518 --> 01:44:37,522
我們是要通過改變現在的事  從而改變未來的事嗎?
Aren't we changing things right now, changing the way it goes?

926
01:44:37,605 --> 01:44:38,719
沒錯
That's right.

927
01:44:39,199 --> 01:44:42,059
本來就快做出超級新電腦
There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor. Not now.

928
01:44:42,485 --> 01:44:45,947
現在一切免談  我不幹了  我明天就辭職
Forget it. I'm out of it. I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.

929
01:44:46,030 --> 01:44:47,907
那還不夠好
That's not good enough.

930
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:49,951
不能讓別人繼續完成你的工作
No one must follow your work.

931
01:44:50,019 --> 01:44:51,519
好吧
Right.

932
01:44:51,953 --> 01:44:56,290
那得摧毀實驗室的一切裝備
All right, then we have to destroy all the stuff at the lab...

933

- Do you know about the chip? - What chip?

939
01:45:09,387 --> 01:45:12,159
他們把它鎖在金庫裏  是跟你一樣的機器人身上的
It's at Cyberdyne. It's from the other one like you.

940
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:14,600
第一代終結者的記憶體
The CPU from the first Terminator.

941
01:45:14,684 --> 01:45:17,061
混蛋  我就知道
Son of a bitch! I knew it!

942
01:45:17,145 --> 01:45:19,856
他們不准我們問晶片是哪兒來的
They told us not to ask where they got it.

943
01:45:19,939 --> 01:45:22,275
真聰明的混蛋
Those lying motherfuckers.

944
01:45:22,358 --> 01:45:24,152
它很可怕  但非常先進
It's scary stuff. Radically advanced.

945
01:45:24,235 --> 01:45:25,361
它被砸爛了
It was smashed.

946
01:45:25,444 --> 01:45:29,073
無法運作  但它給了我許多不可思議的靈感
It didn't work, but it gave us ideas, took us in new directions.

947
01:45:29,157 --> 01:45:31,159
前所未有
Things we would've never...

948
01:45:33,327 --> 01:45:35,413
我的工作全是以它為基礎
All my work was based on it.

949
01:45:35,496 --> 01:45:37,331
必須摧毀它
It must be destroyed.

你能帶我們通過警衛嗎?
Can you get us in? Past security?

I think so, yeah. When?

01:46:53,759 --> 01:46:56,994
戴森先生  你也知道規定  帶客人進實驗室時
Mr. Dyson, you know the rules concerning visitors in the lab.

962
01:46:57,078 --> 01:46:59,247
我需要書面許可
I need written authorization...

963
01:47:00,289 --> 01:47:02,291
我堅持
I insist.

964
01:47:02,375 --> 01:47:04,126
你休想妄動
Don't even think about it.

965
01:47:15,096 --> 01:47:16,555
行了
It's okay.

966
01:47:17,974 --> 01:47:21,129
開金庫要兩把鑰匙  而且得同時插入旋轉
It takes two keys, turned simultaneously, to open the vault.

967
01:47:21,185 --> 01:47:24,105
另一支在警衛室裏
The other one is in a locker at the security station.

968

Gibbons?

969
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:31,779
吉文  老兄
Gibbons! Come on, man!

970
01:47:31,862 --> 01:47:34,949
你不能擅離崗位的
You can't leave the desk like that!

971
01:47:37,019 --> 01:47:38,019
吉文
Gibbons!

972
01:47:39,787 --> 01:47:41,289
糟糕
Oh, shit.

973
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:00,850
我的卡片應該可以開啟它
My card should access this.

974
01:48:04,479 --> 01:48:05,379
什麼?
What?

975
01:48:05,521 --> 01:48:07,940
- 怎麼回事?  - 可惡
- What is it? - Damn it.

976
01:48:08,024 --> 01:48:09,984
警報器已經啟動
The silent alarm's been tripped.

977
01:48:16,157 --> 01:48:18,909
它使所有啟動密碼都失效了
It's neutralized all the codes in the entire building.

978
01:48:18,993 --> 01:48:20,911
現在到處都不通了
Nothing will open anywhere now.

979
01:48:21,996 --> 01:48:23,831
我們得放棄此事
We have to abort.

980
01:48:24,004 --> 01:48:25,000
不
No.

981
01:48:27,043 --> 01:48:30,463
我們幹到底
We go all the way. Okay?

982
01:48:32,590 --> 01:48:36,385
你們在實驗室開始行動  我能打開這個
You guys get started on the lab. I can open this.

983
01:48:36,469 --> 01:48:38,929
- 是大鬧商場的傢伙  - 是那傢伙
- I think it's that guy from the mall. - It is.

984
01:48:39,013 --> 01:48:40,931
對  是他和那女人
Yeah. It's him and the woman.

985
01:48:42,516 --> 01:48:45,686
立即總動員到這裏來
Just send everything you got in the area right now.

986
01:48:47,897 --> 01:48:51,359
我的私人密碼可能還能通
I have a personal entry code for the lab. It may still work.

987
01:48:55,863 --> 01:48:56,906
沒有用
It's no good.

988
01:48:56,989 --> 01:48:58,532
試試我的法子
Let me try mine.

989
01:49:03,496 --> 01:49:05,581
約翰  小心
John, fire in the hole!

990
01:49:17,635 --> 01:49:22,431
且慢  現在不能進去  火焰啟動了"海龍消防系統"
Wait! You can't go in there. The fire set off the Halon system.

991
01:49:29,605 --> 01:49:32,066
等幾分鐘  要讓毒氣消散
You have to wait until the gas clears.

992
01:49:34,568 --> 01:49:35,861
戴防毒面具
Put this on.

993
01:49:49,834 --> 01:49:52,336
