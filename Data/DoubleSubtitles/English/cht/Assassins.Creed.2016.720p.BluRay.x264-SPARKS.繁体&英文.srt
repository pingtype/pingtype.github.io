00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,960
跟著記憶走  卡爾
Stay with the memory, Cal.

150
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:07,620
阿圭拉  那孩子  阿圭拉  孩子
Aguilar! The boy, Aguilar! The boy!

151
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,890
阿圭拉  孩子
Aguilar, the boy!

152
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,430
把他拉回來
Pull him!

153
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,530
啟動復原
Commence rehabilitation.

154
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,530
進行系統檢查  記錄他的情況
Run a system's check, and log his condition.

155
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,230
你做得很好  卡爾
You did well, Cal.

156
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,710
回顧歷史  很明確的一點就是
Looking back it's clear that

157
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:35,390
世界歷史就是一部暴力史
a history of the world is history a violence.

158
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,930
去年的反社會行為
Last year the economic impact of

159
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,600
對經濟造成的損失高達9萬億美元
antisocial behavior was 9 trillion dollars.

160
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:50,090
我們認為現代人總會有一些暴力沖動
We believe that man today experiences a measure of aggression

161
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:54,280
但卻找不到合適的宣泄方式
for which he finds no acceptable outlets.

162
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,550
想象一下
Now imagine

163
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:00,350
如果這些代價  可以在別的地方得到管控...
if all these costs could be channeled elsewhere...

164
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,080
回溯進行得順利嗎
So regression went well?

165
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,650
就是林奇
Lynch is the one.

166
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,420
他是阿圭拉的直系后裔
Direct descendent of Aguilar.

167
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,890
一切都清晰了起來  這可是第一次
Everything was clear in there, for the first time.

168
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,220
我們共同的夢想是什么
What do we all dream of?

169
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,000
就是一個更和平的世界
A more peaceful world.

170
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,970
你又盜用我的演講辭
I see you stole my lines again.

171
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,000
我只盜用最出色的人
I only steal from the best.

172
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,000
那件寶物呢
And the artifact?

173
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,060
伊甸蘋果  唾手可得
The Apple. It's within our grasp.

174
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,320
在里面發生了什么
What happened in there?

175
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,550
你為什么將他拉回來了
Why did you pull him?

176
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:30,700
我必須如此
I had to.

177
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,840
我們要保護他的安全
We have to keep him healthy.

178
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,330
贏得他的信任
Earn his confidence.

179
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,710
我確信他能帶領我們找到寶物
And I know that will lead us to it.

180
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,710
對他狠點
Push him.

181
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,650
阿尼姆斯的運作方式不是這樣的
That's not how the Animus works.

182
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,030
好了
Here you go.

183
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,800
謝謝
Thank you.

184
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,970
1917年  盧瑟福分裂開了原子
1917 Rutherford splits the atom.

185
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:06,670
1953年  沃森和克里克發現雙螺旋
1953 Watson and Crick find a double helix.

186
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:11,780
2016年  我的女兒
2016 my daughter,

187
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,150
找到了根除暴力的方法
finds the cure for violence.

188
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,090
你向來都比我聰明
You've always been brighter than me.

189
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,230
我要遲到了
I'm late.

190
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,130
我還得向長老會匯報
I have to report to the Elders.

191
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,450
弗朗西斯科·利茲的《宗教裁判所大法官》
Francisco Rizi's Grand Inquisition.

192
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,860
1492年
1492.

193
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,050
戰爭  宗教迫害
War, religious prosecution,

194
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,930
也是托爾克馬達法官及騎士團成員
and the closest Father Torquemada or any of our Order

195
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,320
尋找伊甸蘋果最接近成功的一次了
came to a finding the Apple of Eden.

196
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,560
你還好嗎  朋友
How are you, my friend?

197
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,830
很好
Well.

198
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,030
大人
Your Excellency.

199
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,950
下周  等長老們會面
Next week when the Elders meet,

200
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:20,480
我們會就是否中斷你的阿布斯泰戈項目進行投票
we shall vote to discontinue your Abstergo project.

201
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,980
我們覺得  每年給你的三十億資金
We feel that giving you 3 billion annually,

202
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,620
花在別處會有更大的用途
could be better spent elsewhere.

203
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,690
三十億相比...
Tri billion is nothing compared to...

204
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,950
我們勝利了
We've won.

205
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,260
人們已經不在乎他們的公民自由了
People are no longer care about their civil liberties,

206
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,390
他們只在乎自己的生活水平
they care about their standard of life.

207
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:38,680
現代世界已經拋棄自由這種理念了
The modern world has outgrown notions like freedom.

208
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,060
他們樂于盲從
They are content to follow.

209
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:46,350
只要自由意志尚存  威脅就依然存在
The threat remains while free will exists.

210
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:49,230
數個世紀以來  我們試圖通過宗教
For centuries we try with religion,

211
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:53,590
政治  以及現在的消費主義  來鏟除異議
with politics and now consumerism to eliminate dissent.

212
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,410
現在難道不是時候嘗試科學辦法了嗎
Isn't it the time we gave a science a try?

213
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,800
我女兒比我們所有人都要更接近成功了
My daughter is closer than we've ever been.

214
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,120
你美麗的女兒怎么樣了
How is your beautiful daughter?

215
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:06,580
她追蹤到了伊甸蘋果的守護者
She has traced protectors of the Apple.

216
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,470
在哪兒
Where?

217
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,100
安達盧西亞  1492年
Andalucia, 1492.

218
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,980
他們的后人呢
The descendents?

219
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,430
所有的后人都死光了
All the blood lines have died out.

220
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,220
只剩下一個
But one.

221
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,920
我們追蹤他的血脈到500年前 
We've traced his back 500 years,

222
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,270
定位到刺客兄弟會身上
to the Assassin's Brotherhood.

223
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,900
幻覺  就是我們所謂的"血緣效應"
Hallucinations are what we call the "Bleeding effect."

224
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,630
回溯后的畫面
Images of your regression,

225
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,560
潛藏在你現在的視界里
laying themselves over your present day field of vision.

226
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:56,250
如果你允許的話  我可以教你怎么控制它們
If you allow me, I can teach you how to control them.

227
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,740
退下  我可以搞定
Stand down. I have this.

228
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,690
隨她去吧
Let her be.

229
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,170
那臺機器  到底是什么東西
What is it? The machine?

230
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,510
那是基因記憶機器
It's genetic memory.

231
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,250
通過使用阿尼姆斯
By using the Animus,

232
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:15,370
我們可以獲取祖先的記憶
we can relive lives of those who made us who we are.

233
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:32,250
我看到的情形  感覺很真實
What I saw in there, it felt real.

234
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,640
的確如此
It was.

235
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:36,820
在某種程度上是
In a way.

236
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,930
別跟我耍花招
Don't mess with me!

237
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,740
我現在感覺不一樣了
I feel different now.

238
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,540
為什么這么有攻擊性
Why the aggression?

239
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,560
我本就是個有攻擊性的人
I'm an aggressive person.

240
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,350
這是什么監獄
What kind of prison is this?

241
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,650
這里不是監獄  卡爾
It's not a prison, Cal.

242
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,660
只要你乖乖合作  就會了解到更多東西
You'll learn more if you cooperate.

243
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,390
放開我
Let me go.

244
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,790
我餓了
I'm hungry.

245
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,730
跟我來
Come with me.

246
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:44,060
{\an8}林奇
1979年-現在

247
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,140
{\an8}對卡勒姆·林奇的擔憂加深

248
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,940
{\an8}黑幫突襲當地辦事處
林奇必死無疑

249
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,160
這是什么東西
What is this?

250
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,220
我知道關于你的一切  卡爾
I know everything about you, Cal.

251
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:55,960
你的醫療數據  你的心理檔案
Your medical data, your psychological profile,

252
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:59,240
以及你MAO-A基因的變異
the mutations in your MAO-A gene.

253
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,950
我知道你在寄養家庭的事
I know about the foster homes.

254
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,830
在少管所的事
The juvenile homes.

255
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,330
你是遺傳和犯罪存在關聯的活生生的證據
You are a living proof of the link between heredity and crime.

256
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,830
你們是怎么找到我的
How did you find me?

257
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,950
我們先找到了阿圭拉
We found Aguilar.

258
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,450
你被逮捕時  你的DNA被發現與他的相匹配
When you were arrested, your DNA matched his.

259
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,440
-阿圭拉是誰  -你的祖先
- Who is Aguilar? - Your ancestor.

260
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,180
他的家族祖上都是刺客
His family were Assassins.

261
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,060
他們被圣殿騎士團  托爾克馬達  和你看到的
They were burnt at the stake by the Templars,

262
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:29,630
那個黑衣騎士奧哈達綁在柱子上燒死了
Torquemada and the black knight you saw, Ojeda.

263
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:33,150
阿圭拉繼承了刺客大業
Aguilar took up the Assassins' cause.

264
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,210
你經常外出嗎
Do you go out much?

265
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,620
比你外出的時候多
More than you.

266
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,700
這里的其他人呢  也都是實驗室里的小白鼠嗎
And the others in here? Are they the lab rats too?

267
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,610
他們也是刺客  跟他們的祖先一樣都是殺手
They are Assassins, murderers like their ancestors.

268
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,700
跟你一樣  卡爾
Like you, Cal.

269
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:57,990
天生就具有暴力傾向
All born with predisposition to violence.

270
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,620
殺手
Murderer?

271
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:09,560
-你殺了那個人  -他是個皮條客
- You killed the man. - A pimp.

272
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,150
你會再次殺人嗎
Would you kill again?

273
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,340
幸福的一家人
Happy families.

274
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,570
她一定為你感到很驕傲
She must be very proud.

275
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,390
我不知道
I wouldn't know.

276
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,820
她被一名刺客殺死了
She was killed by an Assassin.

277
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,950
跟你母親的遭遇一樣
Like your mother.

278
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,800
抱歉
Sorry.

279
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,510
我父親殺了我母親
My old man killed my mother.

280
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,790
那讓你是什么感覺
And how does that make you feel?

281
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,030
我想殺了他
Like killing him.

282
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,400
要么我們讓這事影響我們一輩子
Either we let it to effect us for the rest of our lives,

283
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,500
要么采取點措施
or we just do something about it.

284
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,830
你選擇了暴力  我選擇了科學
You turn to violence, I turn to science.

285
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,020
那是伊甸蘋果  卡爾
It's the Apple of Eden, Cal.

286
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,850
我相信它真的存在
I believe it exists.

287
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,520
《圣經》告訴我們
The Bible tells us

288
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,830
其中蘊含了人類第一次違抗命令的種子
it contained the seed of man's first disobedience.

289
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,460
但也有些人認為
But there are those of us who believe that

290
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,730
上帝  或某種古文明
God or some ancient civilization

291
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,720
給我們留下了一張指示圖
have left us a road map

292
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,530
幫助我們了解人為什么會有暴力性
to understand why people are violent.

293
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:36,030
據稱伊甸蘋果最后一次出現是在阿圭拉手上
Aguilar was the last person known to have had it in his possession.

294
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:39,330
我們需要你查出他把那東西藏在哪兒了
We need you to find out where he hid it.

295
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,290
我以為我是來接受治療的
I thought I was here to be cured.

296
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,490
暴力就是一種疾病
Violence is a disease.

297
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:47,370
跟癌癥一樣
Like cancer.

298
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:52,160
并且如同癌癥  我們希望有一天能控制住它
And like cancer, we hope to control it one day.

299
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,890
正是暴力讓我活到了今天
Violence is what kept me alive.

300
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,700
嚴格來說  你已經死了
Well technically, you're dead.

301
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,970
我餓了
I'm hungry.

302
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,550
我能得到什么好處
What's in it for me?

303
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,090
一旦我的研究完成了
Once my research is complete,

304
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,180
就沒必要把你關在這里了
there is no reason to keep you here.

305
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,880
我能過上以前的生活
I get my life back?

306
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:18,510
更好  你能擁有全新的生活
Better. A new one.

307
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,670
你不是餓了嗎
You are hungry.

308
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:45,450
你不知道他是什么人  也不清楚他的本性
You don't know who he is, what he is.

309
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,050
他是個危險人物
He is a dangerous man.

310
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:51,330
再給他點時間  埃米爾
Give him little more time, Emir.

311
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:54,710
那家伙可能會證明  他身上有高貴的血統
Man may prove that has some noble blood in him yet.

312
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,310
不如坐這里吧  先生
How about here, sir?

313
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:08,760
菜單上有很多可選項  但我們推薦雞肉
It's an open menu, but we do recommend a chicken.

314
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,300
你需要什么  林奇先生  菜單上有很多可選項
What can I get you, Mr. Lynch? It's an open menu,

315
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,160
但我們推薦雞肉
but we do recommend a chicken.

316
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,430
我要牛排
I'll steak.

317
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,990
給這位先驅來份牛排
Steak for the pioneer.

318
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,920
你是誰
Who are you?

319
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:38,450
他們都叫我穆薩
They call me Moussa.

320
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,970
但我的真名叫巴普蒂斯特  我已經死了200年了
But my name is Baptiste. I'm dead 200 years now.

321
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,270
巫毒大師
Voodoo poisoner.

322
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,840
我是無害的
I'm harmless.

323
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,200
他們都在觀察你
They're watching you.

324
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:02,300
等著看你是什么樣的人  先驅
Waiting to see who you are, pioneer.

325
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,680
你見過他了嗎
Have you met him yet?

326
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,700
你見過他了嗎
Have you met him yet?

327
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:17,900
我們是伊甸蘋果最后的守護者  朋友
We are the last to protect the Apple, my friend.

328
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,980
你一旦做出錯誤的選擇 
Pick the wrong choice,

329
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,880
就會把我們全部打入無限時空
you'll send us all to infinity.

330
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,610
這個
This...

331
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,810
屬于你
belongs to you.

332
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,890
你要帶領他們找到伊甸蘋果
You're going to lead them right to it.

333
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,180
不  我會把蘋果吃掉
No, I'm going to eat it.

334
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,550
到底怎么回事
What the fuck is going on?

335
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,080
他必須再次進入阿尼姆斯
He has to go back in the Animus.

336
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:42,270
馬上
Now.

337
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,710
他需要休息一段時間  才能再次進入
He needs more time before he goes in again.

338
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:48,420
我們沒時間了
We don't have time.

339
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,450
為什么
Why?

340
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,380
我不會拿他的生命冒險
I won't risk his life.

341
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,330
那我只好找其他人代勞了
I'll have to find someone else to do it.

342
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:15,520
到你了  猛男
You're up, slugger.

343
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:17,290
我瘋了
I'm crazy.

344
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:25,250
我瘋了
I'm crazy.

345
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:30,280
瘋狂想感覺如此孤寂
Crazy for feeling so lonely.

346
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,940
他們打算把他再次送進阿尼姆斯
They're getting him back in again.

347
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:44,850
我們應該在他背叛我們之前阻止他
We should stop him before he betrays us.

348
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,350
設置好中斷日期
Set the date for the six.

349
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:51,310
如果他的情況惡化  就把他拉出來
If his condition deteriorates, pull him out.

350
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:54,190
-你父親說...  -我不管他說過什么
- You father... - I don't care what my father said.

351
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:59,480
我到底做錯了什么
What in the world did I do?

352
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,360
-卡爾  聽我說  -我瘋狂嘗試...
- Cal, listen to me. - I'm crazy for trying...

353
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,070
聽我說  你必須跟阿圭拉保持合體狀態
Listen to me. You have to stay with Aguilar.

354
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:06,450
瘋狂想哭泣...
Crazy for crying...

355
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:08,920
脫離同步狀態可能會有危險
Staying in synch-void could be dangerous.

356
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:15,150
我瘋狂地愛著你...
And I'm crazy for loving you...

357
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,860
很快他們將進軍格拉納達
Soon they will march on Granada.

358
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:00,280
默罕默德蘇丹王很軟弱
Sultan Muhammad is weak.

359
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:05,040
他為了救王子
He'll surrender the Apple

360
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:09,210
肯定會交出蘋果  背叛信條
and betray the Creed to save the prince.

361
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:14,180
愛讓我們軟弱
The love makes us weak.

362
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:24,570
我愿意犧牲自己的親骨肉
Gladly I'll sacrifice my flesh and blood,

363
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:27,390
換取信條永存
for survival of the Creed.

364
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:46,470
我今日若死  你無需為我落淚
When I die today, don't waste your tears for me.

365
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,020
主已給出指示
The Lord spoke.

366
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:40,610
他說
And he said:

367
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:45,050
"一個人若不住在我里面
"If a man abide not in me

368
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,640
他就會被丟進火里
he is cast into the fire

369
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:50,980
被焚燒殆盡"
and he is burned!"

370
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,450
數十年以來
For decades,

371
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,580
你們都活在因宗教紛爭
you have lived in the world torn apart

372
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:04,700
而分崩離析的世界
by religious discord.

373
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,030
但不久之后  多虧上帝
But soon, thanks to God

374
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,500
和宗教裁判所
and Inquisition

375
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:17,460
我們將徹底清除這種疾病
we will purge this disease!

376
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:28,420
在你們面前的罪人
The sinners before you,

377
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:32,870
企圖保護格拉納達的異教王子
sought to defend the heretic prince of Granada,

378
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:40,160
那里是圣戰要攻下的最后一個異教徒據點
the last heathen stronghold in our holy war.

379
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,550
所以今天
So today,

380
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:47,110
在國王和王后的見證下
before our king and queen

381
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:50,170
我發誓  我們都將在上帝的圣火中
I swear we shall wash ourselves clean,

382
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:53,740
洗凈污穢
in the holy fire of God!

383
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:58,670
看啊
Behold...

384
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,830
上帝的旨意
God's will!

385
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,460
你將眼睜睜看著你的師父被燒死
You will watch your mentor burn

386
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:10,360
然后你也將受盡折磨而死
and then you will die the slowest.

387
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,690
將榮耀歸于未來
Give glory to the future.

388
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:31,450
而不是我們
Not to us.

389
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,150
他正在同步
He is synchronizing.

390
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:26,670
該死的異教徒
Damned heretics!

391
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,490
別讓他們跑了
Don't let them escape!

392
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:20,730
跳啊
Jump.

393
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,000
解除同步完成
Complete desynch.

394
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,160
放他下來
Get him down!

395
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:44,510
快叫醫護人員來
Call the medics!

396
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:55,020
沒事了  卡爾  堅持住  卡爾
Okay. It's okay. Cal, stay with me. Cal.

397
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,690
堅持住  沒事了  快點
Stay... It's okay. Hurry up!

398
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,500
沒事了  看著我
Okay. Okay. Look at me.

399
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:11,210
看著我
Look at me.

400
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,880
我的腿失去知覺了
I can't feel my legs.

401
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,890
身體麻痹只是暫時的
Paralysis is temporal.

402
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:45,330
壞消息是什么
What's the bad news?

403
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:48,940
它引起了神經分裂  但我們把你治好了
It caused a neurological split but we got you through it.

404
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:50,940
這一次僥幸而已
This time.

405
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:53,860
我會死在這里的  對吧
I'm gonna die in here, aren't I?

406
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:58,680
不
No.

407
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,870
如果你憑借你的自由意志進去  就不會死
Not if you go in there on your own free will.

408
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:08,810
我做不到
I can't do this.

409
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,460
你可以的
Yes, you can.

410
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:15,930
能找到伊甸蘋果的人只剩下你了
The Apple. You're the only one left who can find it.

411
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:20,880
我們能結束痛苦  卡爾
We can put an end to pain, Cal.

412
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:23,430
幫助所有人
For everyone.

413
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,510
你從哪里找到的
Where did you get this?

414
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:55,650
我父親在你母親的兇殺現場找到的
My father recovered it from the scene of your mother's murder.

415
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:57,430
然后帶到這里來保管
And brought it here for safekeeping.

416
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:59,390
保管
Safekeeping?

417
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:02,950
你們這是偷竊
You stole it.

418
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,020
這是你母親的項鏈  我想交給你
It's your mother's necklace. I wanted you to have it.

419
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:08,850
他為什么會去那里
Why was he there?

420
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:11,030
-去救她  -誰要害她
- To save her. - From whom?

421
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:14,150
-她的同僚  -那跟你有什么關系
- Her own people. - What's that got to do with you?

422
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:18,410
刺客和圣殿騎士已經交戰了數個世紀
Assassins and Templars have been at war for centuries.

423
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,810
我希望能改變這局面
I aim to change that.

424
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:23,080
對哦  我忘了
That's right, I forgot.

425
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,160
我們的目的是根除暴力
We're here to combat aggression.

426
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:30,210
我不喜歡你的方式
I don't think I like your methods.

427
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:33,770
我是一個科學家
I am a scientist.

428
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:36,670
我來這里是為了治好我暴力的一面
I'm here to be cured of violence.

429
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,720
但有誰能治好你呢
Who's gonna cure you?

430
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:29,450
我們是在喂養一頭野獸
We're feeding the beast.

431
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,530
我們在使他變得愈發強大
We're making him stronger.

432
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,760
我是萊肯博士
I am Dr Rikkin.

433
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:51,500
叫我亞倫吧
Alan.

434
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,900
我負責管理阿布斯泰戈
I look after things here in Abstergo.

435
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:00,860
你不喜歡讓外人插手  對吧
You like to keep things in the family, huh?

436
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,270
沒錯
Yes.

437
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:07,010
如果我們給你造成不適  很抱歉
I'm sorry if we caused you any discomfort.

438
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:08,940
有什么需要我幫忙的嗎
Is there anything I can do?

439
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:10,780
讓我離開這里怎么樣
How about you let me out of here?

440
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,690
這件事我辦不到
That's something I can't manage.

441
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:28,260
我是來跟你做一筆交易的
I'm here to make a deal.

442
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:31,900
我們需要伊甸蘋果
We need the Apple.

443
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,030
也需要你幫我們找到它
And we need you to get it for us.

444
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:41,290
你在阿尼姆斯里一直在解除同步
You've been desynching in the Animus.

445
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,730
請你不要再那樣做
We need you not to do that.

446
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:47,010
又要把我送進那臺機器里了嗎
Sending me back to the machine?

447
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:51,070
不  你已經讓我們看到我們需要看到的情形了
No, you've already shown us what we needed to see.

448
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:52,810
那你會釋放我們嗎
Will you let us free then?

449
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:04,770
你希望從那個新人身上得到什么
What do you hope to gain from the newcomer?

450
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,660
能讓所有人都受益的東西
Something that'll benefit us all.

451
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:13,850
包括你  穆薩
You too, Moussa.

452
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:40,520
你對他們做了什么
What have you done to them?

453
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,100
如果你用自己的意志
It's what happens

454
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:47,440
進行時空回溯  就會產生這種后果
if you don't enter in regression on your own volition.

455
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:55,480
你認識這個嗎
Do you recognize this?

456
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:58,840
這是刺客之刃
It's Assassin's blade.

457
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:04,460
你父親正是用這把刀
This is the actual one...

458
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:09,630
奪去了你母親的生命
your father used to take your mother's life.

459
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,950
他也在這里  你知道嗎
He's here, you know?

460
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,360
一個母親的死亡  卡爾
Mother's death, Cal.

461
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:27,570
永遠不該讓她兒子看到
Not something a boy should ever be made to see.

462
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,270
這樣做不對
This is wrong.

463
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,510
是你讓我別無選擇
You left me no choice.

464
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:23,550
他一定要靠自己的自由意志進去  是你說的
He has to go in on his own free will, you said that.

465
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:26,910
-我只能去協商  -你是指操縱吧
- I had to negotiate. - You mean manipulate?

466
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:32,840
我向長老們承諾了我們會把伊甸蘋果送到倫敦
I assured the Elders we would have the Apple for London.

467
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,980
只剩下兩天時間了
That's in two days.

468
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:43,830
他不想知道自己的過去  也不想認識自己的父親
He doesn't want to know his past, or his father.

469
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:46,770
他想毀掉這兩樣東西
He wants to destroy them, both.

470
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,620
我們不是在制造怪物
We're not in the business of creating monsters.

471
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:52,400
我們沒有制造它們  也沒有毀掉它們
We neither created them nor destroyed them.

472
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,620
我們不過是將它們拋向自己必然的信念
We merely abandoned them to their own inexorable faith.

473
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:15,430
-你是你母親的孩子  -什么意思
- You're your mother's son. - What does that mean?

474
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:21,350
你體內的血液不屬于你自己
Blood that flows through you is not your own.

475
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:24,020
而屬于信條
Belongs to the Creed.

476
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,240
你母親深知這一點
Your mother knew that.

477
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:30,110
她用死換來信條的傳承
She died so the Creed may live.

478
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,030
告訴我到底是怎么回事
Remind me how, exactly!

479
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:40,530
你看到的事  是我干的
What you saw, I did.

480
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,980
你殺了她
You murdered her.

481
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:52,260
我殺了她  總比讓那臺機器弄死她要好
I took her life rather than have it stolen by that machine.

482
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:58,090
人因其崇高的使命而成長
Man grows with the greatness of his task.

483
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:01,570
我應該把你也殺了
I ought to have killed you.

484
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,770
我下不了手
I couldn't.

485
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:09,090
給你
Well, here.

486
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:11,820
拿著
Take it.

487
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:15,000
完成你30年前沒能做到的事
Do what you couldn't do 30 years ago.

488
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,320
如今刺客之刃已在你手中  卡爾
It's in your hands now, Cal.

489
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:19,730
這正是他們想要的結果
This is what they want.

490
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:22,700
殺了我
Spill my blood.

491
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:26,870
但千萬不要再進入阿尼姆斯
But do not go back in the Animus.

492
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:28,480
為什么
Why?

493
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:34,420
伊甸蘋果當中蘊含著自由意志的基因密碼
The Apple contains the genetic code for free will.

494
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:36,970
他們會用來毀滅我們
They will use it to destroy us.

495
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:40,390
我一定會找到的
I'm gonna find it.

496
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:47,280
然后看著他們  毀掉你和你的信條
And watch them destroy you and your Creed.

497
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,470
信條是殺不死的
You can not kill the Creed.

498
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:52,380
它根植于你的血液中
It's in your blood.

499
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,400
伊甸蘋果就是一切
The Apple is everything.

500
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:58,110
你母親為了保護它犧牲了生命
Your mother died to protect it.

501
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:03,450
她當年別無選擇
She had no choice.

502
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:13,460
但我有
I do.

503
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:01,960
你要殺了信條
You're gonna kill the Creed!

504
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:11,660
帶我去阿尼姆斯
Take me to the Animus.

505
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,420
把我放進去
Put me in.

506
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:24,030
準備阿尼姆斯
Prepare the Animus.

507
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,750
自愿回溯
Voluntary regression.

508
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,740
你知道殺手的名字是怎么得來的
Do you know how the Assassins came to be named?

509
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:36,320
是根據阿拉伯詞語"哈薩辛"演變來的
From an Arabic word "Hashashin".

510
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,790
他們曾是社會的棄徒
They were society's outcasts.

511
01:07:38,790 --> 01:07:42,880
他們會偷盜  冷血地殺人
Those who stole, who murdered in cold blood.

512
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:48,940
人們都嘲弄他們  叛黨  白癡  癮君子
People ridiculed them... Rebels, fools, drug addicts.

513
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:51,220
但其實他們很明智
But they were wise.

514
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:55,900
他們利用這種罵名  來隱藏自身對信條的忠貞
They used this reputation to hide the dedication to principles

515
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:58,930
甚至瞞過了最強大的敵人
beyond those of even their strongest enemies.

516
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:04,330
為此  我很欽佩他們
And for that I admire them.

517
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,220
但你不是其中的一員
But you're not one of those men.

518
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,640
對吧
Are you?

519
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:15,410
那就試試看吧
Let's find out.

520
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,180
開始回溯
Commencing regression.

521
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:33,690
這是我畢生的事業
This is my life's work.

522
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:37,290
這是我的生命
It's my life.

523
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,130
為了信條
For the Creed.

524
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:33,290
我們自身的生命
Our own lives...

525
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:36,950
重要的是  我們為后世留下什么
What matters is what we leave behind.

526
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:55,030
蘇丹
Sultan...

527
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:57,830
把伊甸蘋果交出來
Surrender the Apple.

528
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,680
那些保護你的刺客都已經走了
Your Assassin protectors are gone.

529
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:04,650
信條已經完了
The Creed is finished.

530
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,670
我兒
My son.

531
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:31,110
這里面是人類第一次違抗命令的種子
Here lies the seed of man's first disobedience,

532
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:34,920
是自由意志
of free will itself.

533
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:47,870
多虧了伊甸蘋果
Thanks to the Apple of Eden,

534
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,540
這已知的世界
the known world

535
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:53,880
將會被引入新紀元
shall be ushered into a new age.

536
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:57,010
一個和平的新紀元
One of peace,

537
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:01,030
在那里  所有彼此敵對的人類
in which all the warring populations of mankind

538
01:12:01,030 --> 01:12:07,890
將完全服從圣殿的統治
shall bow in perfect obedience to our one templar rule.

539
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:15,100
伊甸蘋果
The Apple.

540
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:17,280
交給他
Give it to him.

541
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:20,080
立刻
Now.

542
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:24,850
為了信條
For the Creed.

543
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,440
快走
Go!

544
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,890
原諒我
Forgive me.

545
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:09,990
已經結束了
It's over!

546
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:17,880
有刺客
Assassin!

547
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,470
信仰之躍
A leap of faith.

548
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:13,120
現在在哪兒
Where are we?

549
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:17,130
似乎是個軍事港口
It looks like a military port.

550
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:32,210
位于加的斯  帕洛斯德拉夫龍特拉
Kadiz, Palos de la Frontera.

551
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:11,830
刺客為此而死
The Assassins died for it.

552
01:20:12,690 --> 01:20:15,010
用你的生命去保護它
Protect it with your life.

553
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:18,510
我是信條的朋友
I am a friend of the Creed.

554
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:27,730
帶入你的墳墓
Take it to your grave.

555
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:29,740
我發誓
I swear.

556
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:50,460
他們在說什么  翻譯一下
What is it? Translation.

557
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,210
追尋著太陽的光芒
Following the light of the sun,

558
01:20:58,210 --> 01:21:00,930
我將拋下這個舊世界
I shall leave this old world behind.

559
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:04,000
是克里斯托弗·哥倫布
It's Christopher Columbus.

560
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,780
他的墳墓在哪里
Where is he buried?

561
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:09,090
他的遺體被轉送回了西班牙
His remains were returned to Spain.

562
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:12,530
他的墳墓在塞維利亞大教堂里
His tomb is in Seville Cathedral.

563
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,720
我們找到了
We found it.

564
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:51,390
全明星們  過來
Hey All Stars, come here.

565
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,240
挑一個
Pick one.

566
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,490
隨便選一個
Anyone.

567
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:14,080
-休息大廳發生襲擊事件  -封鎖阿尼姆斯
- Breach in common room. - Seal the Animus.

568
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:36,090
那是記憶嗎
Is it a memory?

569
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:38,610
不是
No.

570
01:23:35,930 --> 01:23:37,150
快啊
Come on!

571
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,680
-傳輸裝置如何了  -準備就緒
- Transport? - Standing by.

572
01:23:54,910 --> 01:23:58,120
保護好阿尼姆斯  肅清整個機構
Protect the Animus. Purge the facility.

573
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,240
我需要先把你救出去
I need to get you out of here first.

574
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:10,910
-不行  -我們必須走了  索菲婭
- No! - We have to leave, Sophia.

575
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:54,470
不
No!

576
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:57,070
不要
No!

577
01:25:24,370 --> 01:25:26,320
你不是一個人  卡爾
You are not alone, Cal.

578
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:29,490
你從來都不是
You never were.

579
01:25:43,850 --> 01:25:46,170
-開門  -快
- Open... - Come on.

580
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:03,590
所有人都盲目追尋著真相時
Where other men blindly follow the truth,

581
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:07,110
-記住  -一切皆虛
- remember... - Nothing is true.

582
01:26:07,710 --> 01:26:11,740
所有人都被道德或法律束縛時
Where other men are limited by morality or law,

583
01:26:13,050 --> 01:26:16,910
-記住  -無事不允
- remember... - Everything is permitted.

584
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:21,620
我們在黑暗中侍奉光明
We work in the darkness to serve the light.

585
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:25,540
我們是刺客
We are Assassins.

586
01:26:54,130 --> 01:26:56,330
現在要怎樣  先驅
What now, pioneer?

587
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:02,100
我們要戰斗
We fight.

588
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:56,020
大人
Your Excellency.

589
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:00,510
榮譽將屬于你父親
The glory will go to your father.

590
01:31:02,170 --> 01:31:04,490
但我們都知道是誰找到的
But we both know who found it.

591
01:31:08,050 --> 01:31:10,330
屬于你的光輝時刻會到來的  孩子
Your time will come, my child.

592
01:31:48,390 --> 01:31:51,770
{\an8}{\pos(192,213.21)}倫敦  圣殿大廳

593
01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:10,990
他們會為此把諾貝爾和平獎頒給你
They'll give you a Nobel peace prize for this.

594
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:13,310
你最好開始寫演講辭了
You better start writing your speech.

595
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:18,230
*-我看過你的演講辭了  -然后呢
- I've read yours. - And?

596
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:25,460
如果我們鏟除了自由意志  就將刺客兄弟會消滅了
If we eradicate free will, we eradicate the Assassins.

597
01:32:25,460 --> 01:32:29,030
他們就像是荼毒社會長達數個世紀的癌癥
A cancer that has menaced society for centuries.

598
01:32:30,090 --> 01:32:34,790
那不是我的最佳作品  但意思都表達清楚了
It's not my best work, but it gets the point across.

599
01:32:36,010 --> 01:32:38,710
我們一直在尋找解決辦法
We've been looking for solutions.

600
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:42,750
你解決了這個問題
You've eliminated the problem.

601
01:32:56,370 --> 01:32:58,330
所以我的項目...
So my program...

602
01:32:58,330 --> 01:33:01,560
第一次為這個社會帶來了秩序
Has brought order to society for the first time.

603
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:06,460
這一切都是我的功勞
I'm accountable for this.

604
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:08,210
已經算上你的功勞了
You've already been accounted for.

605
01:33:08,210 --> 01:33:10,420
我們的成果都屬于長老會
Our work belongs to the Elders.

606
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:12,710
現在是他們最光榮的時刻
This is their finest hour.

607
01:33:15,970 --> 01:33:17,720
你對我撒謊了
You lied to me.

608
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:19,680
我一直都知道
I've always known

609
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:24,250
在你心里  科學排第一位  圣殿騎士團排第二
that in your heart you're a scientist first, templar second.

610
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:27,630
你最近的工作實在太令人嘆為觀止了
Your recent work has impressed as much

611
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:29,970
但那恰恰證實了我們的信仰 
but it has confirmed our belief

612
01:33:29,970 --> 01:33:33,360
也就是人類是無法獲得救贖的
that mankind cannot be redeemed.

613
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,680
所以你早就盤算好了一切
So you've thought of everything.

614
01:33:36,910 --> 01:33:39,100
也不算吧  我的演講辭就沒想好
Not quite. My speech.

615
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:42,480
如果能加上你出色的開場白就更好了
It could do with one of your elegant openings.

616
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:47,190
現在我成了死神
Now I've become death,

617
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:50,360
世界的毀滅者
the destroyer of worlds.

618
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,330
不太確定我能否讓這一切實現
Not sure that I could make that work.

619
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:14,480
今晚  我很榮幸地向大家介紹
It is with great pleasure tonight that I introduce

620
01:34:14,490 --> 01:34:18,680
我們古老騎士團的未來的構建者
the architect of our ancient order's future.

621
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:24,580
有請阿布斯泰戈基金會的總裁
Please welcome the CEO of Abstergo Foundation,

622
01:34:24,580 --> 01:34:26,410
亞倫·萊肯博士
Dr. Alan Rikkin.

623
01:34:42,350 --> 01:34:44,670
隨著伊甸蘋果被重新尋回
With the recovery of the Apple,

624
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:46,850
我們現在擁有了
we are now in possession

625
01:34:46,850 --> 01:34:52,210
關于人類本能的完整基因地圖
of the complete genetic road map to humanity's instincts.

626
01:34:53,110 --> 01:34:56,480
任何能導致獨立
Any impulse towards independence,

627
01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:00,740
抗拒或反叛的沖動  都將被清除
resistance or rebellion will be crushed.

628
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:06,110
任何違背人類進步的體征
Any predisposition that might oppose our march of progress

629
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:10,110
現在都能被根除
can now be eradicated.

630
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:16,620
我只需大喊一聲  你就會沒命
All I have to do is shout.

631
01:35:19,470 --> 01:35:21,210
我是來幫助你的
I'm here to help you.

632
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:25,000
你也是來幫助我的
And you're here to help me.

633
01:35:26,470 --> 01:35:28,790
我幫不了你了
I can't help you anymore.

634
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:32,050
那么那些偉大的計劃呢
What about all those great plans?

635
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:37,260
治愈暴力  攻擊性行為
Cure violence, combat aggression.

636
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:42,180
那是不可能的了
That's not going to happen.

637
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:52,230
是你開啟的這一切  索菲  你不能轉身離開
You've started this, Sophie. You don't get to walk away.

638
01:35:53,790 --> 01:35:56,110
我們都知道接下來會怎樣
We both know what happens next.

639
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:04,160
并非所有東西都有資格活著
Not everything deserves to live.

640
01:36:06,850 --> 01:36:09,170
我做不到
I can't do this.

641
01:36:14,860 --> 01:36:17,180
不  你可以的
Yes, you can.

642
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:31,570
但我們不該將榮耀
But it is not to ourselves,

643
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:35,320
獻給自己  而是應該獻給未來
but to the future, that we must give glory.

644
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:39,700
一個沒有刺客信條的未來
A future purged of the Assassin's Creed!

645
01:36:56,610 --> 01:36:58,430
女士們先生們
Ladies and gentlemen,

646
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,050
這就是伊甸蘋果
the Apple of Eden.

647
01:38:26,990 --> 01:38:28,750
是我干的
I did this.

648
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:41,200
我會替長老會尋回寶物
I will retrieve the artifact for the Elders.

649
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:48,620
但我想把林奇留給自己
Lynch I want for me.

650
01:39:05,570 --> 01:39:06,900
但我們不該將榮耀
It is not to ourselves,

651
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:09,770
獻給自己  而是應該獻給未來
but to the future, that we must give glory.
