I don't like to see the patients disrupting their rooms like this.

100
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:29,900
要確定她有服用鎮定劑
See she takes her Thorazine.

101

她企圖炸毀一間電腦工廠
She tried to blow up a computer factory,

138
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,080
結果遭擊傷被捕
but got shot and arrested.

139
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,209
真糟
No shit.

140
00:17:48,918 --> 00:17:51,295
她是徹底的失敗者
She's a total loser.

141
00:17:51,379 --> 00:17:54,131
走  咱們去花點錢
Come on. Let's go spend some money.

142
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:13,009
<i>我的眼睛</i>
<i>It's like a giant strobe light...</i>

143
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,428
<i>感到一陣灼熱感</i>
<i>burning right through my eyes.</i>

144
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,935
<i>但我似乎仍能看見</i>
<i>Somehow I can still see.</i>

145
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,734
<i>老天</i>
<i>Oh, God.</i>

146
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:36,533
<i>你們知道我的夢境每晚都一樣</i>
<i>We know the dream's the same every night.</i>

147
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:40,036
<i>- 何必要...  - 請繼續</i>
<i>- Why do I have to... - Please continue.</i>

148
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,459
<i>孩子們像紙一樣的燃燒</i>
<i>Children look like burnt paper.</i>

149
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,213
<i>一片漆黑</i>
<i>Black.</i>

150
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,215
<i>無人倖免</i>
<i>Not moving.</i>

151
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,469
<i>一切東西都被燒得面目全非</i>
<i>And then the blast wave hits them.</i>

152
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,481
<i>像樹葉般四處散落</i>
<i>And they fly apart like leaves.</i>

153
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:13,611
<i>你的夢把世界末日</i>
<i>Dreams of cataclysm, the end of the world...</i>

154
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:15,613
<i>描述地很好</i>
<i>are very common.</i>

155
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:21,578
<i>這不是夢  這場核戰是真的</i>
<i>It's not a dream, you moron. It's real.</i>

156
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:25,582
<i>- 我知道這一切將要發生  - 你的夢很有真實感</i>
<i>- I know the date it happens. - I'm sure it feels real to you.</i>

157
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,167
<i>1997年8月29日那天</i>
<i>On August 29, 1997...</i>

158
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:31,754
<i>你也會有完全一樣的感受</i>
<i>it's gonna feel pretty fuckin' real to you too!</i>

159
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:35,508
<i>沒有擦幾萬層防曬油的人都會很慘的</i>
<i>Anybody not wearing two-million sunblock is gonna have a real bad day.</i>

160
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,510
<i>- 懂嗎?  - 別激動</i>
<i>- Get it? - Stop.</i>

161
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:40,471
<i>你們無能為力</i>
<i>God, you think you're safe and alive.</i>

162
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:42,849
<i>你們都會死掉</i>
<i>You're already dead. Everybody!</i>

163
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,435
<i>聽好  你們都會死掉</i>
<i>Him. You. You're dead already.</i>

164
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,396
<i>這兒的一切將消失無蹤</i>
<i>This whole place, everything you see is gone!</i>

165
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:52,567
<i>做夢的人是你們  我保證  你們若再不清醒</i>
<i>You're the one living in the dream, 'cause I know it happens!</i>

166
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,611
<i>就"美夢"成真了</i>
<i>It happens!</i>

167
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,583
我現在好多了
I feel much better now.

168
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,543
清醒了
Clearer.

169
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,421
沒錯  你最近的態度
Yes, your attitude has been...

170
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,798
的確改善不少
much improved lately.

171
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,644
你說我的生活應該有個目標
It's helped me to have a goal...

172
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,897
找件我很希望做的事
something to look forward to.

173
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,148
什麼事?
What is that?

174
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,567
你說過
Well, you said...

175
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:38,488
我的病情若有改善
that if I showed improvement after six months...

176
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,240
你會送我到管理較松的醫院
you would transfer me to the minimum security wing...

177
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:44,077
而且可以讓我會客
and I could have visitors.

178
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:49,749
現在已經過去六個月了
Well, it's been six months and...

179
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,169
我很想見見我兒子
I was looking forward to seeing my son.

180
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:55,672
我明白了
I see.

181
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:03,096
咱們再談談你提到的終結者機器
Let's go back to what you were saying about those Terminator machines.

182
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,642
你現在認為它們不存在了?
Now you think they don't exist?

183
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:11,854
它們不存在  我現在知道了
They don't exist. I know that now.

184
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:15,108
你反覆提及砸爛過一個終結者
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one...

185
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,276
那又怎麼解釋
in a hydraulic press.

186
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:21,781
我若做過這事  應該會有證據留下
If I had, there would have been some evidence.

187
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,283
他們應該會在那工廠找到殘骸
They would have found something at the factory.

188
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,452
我懂了
I see.

189
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:29,956
<i>你不認為電腦公司掩飾了一切?</i>
<i>So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?</i>

190
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,128
<i>不  它們為何要如此?</i>
<i>No. Why would they?</i>

191
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:38,464
- 換個位置  - 好
- Let's try a new position right there. - Okay.

192
00:21:39,037 --> 00:21:43,015
所有感應系統運作正常

193
00:21:43,077 --> 00:21:45,073
對  這是新的零件

194
00:21:46,094 --> 00:21:48,067
線路有點故障

195
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:49,892
戴森先生
Mr. Dyson?

196
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,397
材料小組準備要...
The materials team is running another...

197
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,149
- 戴森先生  - 怎麼啦?
- Mr. Dyson. - Yes?

198
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:59,193
材料小組下午要做實驗
The materials team is running another series this afternoon.

199
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:02,238
你得簽字同意
You have to sign for the... it.

200
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,158
- 把"它"拿出來  - 好的  我懂了
- You have to sign it out. - Okay. I'll get it.

201
00:22:06,988 --> 00:22:08,019
戴森先生
Listen, Mr. Dyson,

202
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,388
我知道我剛進公司
I know I haven't been here long,

203
00:22:09,388 --> 00:22:11,168
但你是否可以告訴我...
but I was wondering if you know...

204
00:22:11,228 --> 00:22:12,623
告訴你什麼?
Know what?

205
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:15,338
你知不知道"它"是哪兒來的?
If you know where "it" came from.

206
00:22:15,388 --> 00:22:17,188
我也問過這個問題  
I asked them the same question once.

207
00:22:17,188 --> 00:22:18,788
他們的回答是
You know what they told me?

208
00:22:18,788 --> 00:22:20,688
"別問"
Don't ask.

209
00:22:26,688 --> 00:22:27,588
你好  戴森先生
Good morning, Mr. Dyson.

210
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,638
- 還好嗎?  - 還好
- How's it going? - Okay.

211
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,852
插入鑰匙  左向  三
Insert key. Left on three.

212
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,271
二  一  轉
Two, one, turn.

213
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,088
- 你老婆孩子還好吧  - 很好  謝謝
- How are the wife and kids? - Great. Thanks.

214
00:22:40,088 --> 00:22:40,888
好了
Here you go.

215
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,849
你覺得如何  大夫?
So what do you think, Doctor?

216
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,685
我有進步  是吧?
Haven't I shown improvement?

217
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:18,731
莎拉  問題是
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

218
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:22,235
我知道你有多聰明
I know how smart you are.

219
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,362
你是挑我愛聽的講
You're just telling me what I want to hear.

220
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,449
我認為你根本言不由衷
I don't think you really believe what you're telling me today.

221
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:32,453
你想調到管理寬鬆的醫院  只是想逃
If I put you in minimum security, you'll just try to escape again.

222
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,585
你得讓我看看我兒子
You have to let me see my son.

223
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:42,421
求求你
Please.

224
00:23:44,076 --> 00:23:45,066
求求你
Please.

225
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:49,595
他有生命危險  他需要我幫助
He's in great danger. He's naked without me.

226
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,473
讓我打個電話也行
If I could make a phone call...

227
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:55,017
不行  一會兒也不行
I'm afraid not. Not for a while.

228
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:59,689
我別無選擇
I don't see any choice but to recommend to the review board...

229
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,358
只好再關你半年
that you stay here for another six months.

230
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:08,823
我要殺了你  混蛋
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

231
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:13,068
- 你這禽獸  - 抓住她
- You son of a bitch! - Get her off!

232
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:16,088
給她打鎮靜劑
Ten CCs of sodium amobarbital, stat!

233
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:18,388
你們這些混蛋
You don't know what you're doing!

234
00:24:18,488 --> 00:24:20,088
快拿藥來
Get some restraints in here now!

235
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:25,715
死到臨頭了還不覺悟
You don't know what you're doing!

236
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:31,846
<i>真是個模範公民</i>
<i>Model citizen.</i>

237
00:24:53,068 --> 00:24:54,368
"目標確認"

238
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:13,596
你剛好錯過  15分鐘前他們剛走
You just missed him. He was here 15 minutes ago.

239
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,848
- 他們好像要去加利瑞購物中心  - 對
- He was going to the galleria. - Yeah.

240
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,488
加利瑞?
The galleria?

241
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:07,149
- 我去換些銅板  馬上回來  - 好
- I'm gonna get some quarters. I'll be back, all right? - Cool.

242
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,948
- 噢  不  - 小姑娘  你們認識約翰·康納嗎?
- Oh, no! - Girls, do you know John Connor?

243
00:26:25,068 --> 00:26:26,068
不認識
No.

244
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,382
嘿  你認識這個孩子嗎?
Hey, do you know this kid?

245
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,634
不  我不認識他
Nah, I don't know him.

246
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:41,350
- 約翰  - 現在不行
- John. - Not now.

247
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:44,687
有個條子在找你  快瞧
There's this cop scoping for you. Check it out.

248
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,150
- 他就在那邊  - 快溜
- He's right over there. - Split, man.

249
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:51,694
- 快走  - 好
- Just go. - Yeah.

250
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:57,658
你在找的人好像往那兒...
I saw that kid...

251
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:14,925
嘿  你不能跑到這裏來
Hey! You're not supposed to be in here!

252
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,588
趴下
Get down.

253
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,817
先生  你沒事吧?
Mister, are you all right?

254
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:57,153
你沒事吧?
You all right?

255
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,669
快啊
Come on!

256
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,002
該死
Goddamn!

257
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:36,825
靠到路邊  停車
Okay, time-out. Stop the bike.

258
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,495
停下來
Time-out. Come on, stop the bike.

259
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:55,302
天啊  別會錯意了
Holy shit. Now, don't take this the wrong way.

260
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:57,763
- 你是終結者  對吧?  - 對
- You are a Terminator, right? - Yes.

261
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:00,788
生化機械  模型101
Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.

262
00:35:00,888 --> 00:35:02,068
不可能吧
No.

263
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,196
好傢伙
Holy shit.

264
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:18,283
你真像真的人
You're really real.

265
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:20,327
我是說
I mean...

266
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,791
你骨子裏是機器人  對吧?
You're like a machine underneath, right?

267
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,376
可外表是人形
But alive outside?

268
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,378
內部是機械骨架
I'm a cybernetic organism.

269
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:32,172
外部是真皮
Living tissue over metal endoskeleton.

270
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:49,147
真帥
This is intense.

271
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:52,025
約翰  清醒一下
Get a grip, John. Okay.

272
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:56,738
你不是來殺我的
You're not here to kill me.

273
00:35:56,822 --> 00:36:00,784
這一點我知道  那你到底要怎樣?
I figured that part out for myself. So what's the deal?

274
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,948
我的任務是要保護你
My mission is to protect you.

275
00:36:03,768 --> 00:36:06,588
是嗎?  誰派你來的?
Yeah? Who sent you?

276
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,626
是你  35年後的你
You did. Thirty-five years from now...

277
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:13,714
派我來保護現在的你
you reprogrammed me to be your protector here in this time.

278
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:16,550
真深奧
Oh, this is deep.

279
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,418
那傢伙跟你一樣是終結者?
So this other guy, he's a Terminator like you, right?

280
00:36:21,518 --> 00:36:25,678
跟我不同  它是T-1000  是更先進的模型
Not like me. A T-1000, advanced prototype.

281
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,937
你是說它比你更先進?
Your mean more advanced than you are?

282
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:33,525
- 對  它是特種合金製造  - 那是什麼意思?
- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy. - What the hell does that mean?

283
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:37,863
- 液態金屬  - 我們去哪兒?
- Liquid metal. - Where are we going?

284
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:41,283
你得立刻離開這座城市  這樣才能逃避它的追殺
We have to get out of the city immediately and avoid the authorities.

285
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:44,458
我想回家去  收拾些東西再走
I gotta stop by my house. I wanna pick up some stuff.

286
00:36:44,558 --> 00:36:48,957
否決  T-1000它一定會在那等你的
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely try to reacquire you there.

287
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:51,794
- 你確定?  - 我確定
- You sure? - I would.

288
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:05,098
陶德和吉納會有危險
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

289
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:08,811
我至少得警告他們
but I gotta warn 'em.

290
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,271
可惡  你有銅板嗎?
Shit. You got a quarter?

291
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:23,033
- 喂  <i>- 吉納  是我</i>
- Hello. <i>- Janelle, it's me.</i>

292
00:37:23,117 --> 00:37:25,494
- 約翰?  <i>- 一切都好嗎?</i>
- John? <i>- Is everything all right?</i>

293
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,996
- 你們都沒事吧?  <i>- 當然  甜心  一切都很好</i>
- Are you guys okay? <i>- Sure, honey, everything's okay.</i>

294
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,166
- 你沒事吧?  <i>- 我很好</i>
- Are you all right? <i>- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

295
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,837
約翰  天晚了  我很擔心你
John, it's late. I was beginning to worry about you.

296
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,631
你趕快回來  我們一起吃晚餐
If you hurry home, we can sit down and have dinner together.

297
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,258
我正在煮牛肉呢
I'm making beef stew.

298
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:41,598
不對勁  她對我從沒這麼好過
Somethings wrong. She's never this nice.

299
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:44,138
約翰  你在哪兒?
John? Where are you?

300
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:47,099
那隻狗在鬼叫什麼勁?
What the hell is the goddamn dog barking at?

301
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:50,435
閉嘴  你這一文不值的廢物
Hey, shut up, you worthless piece of shit!

302
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:51,979
狗在吠叫
The dog's really barking.

303
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:54,438
叫那小鬼把那雜種狗丟掉
You were gonna tell the kid to get rid of that mutt.

304
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,946
約翰  天晚了  別害我擔心
John, it's late. Please don't make me worry.

305
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,739
他已經在那裏了嗎?
Could he already be there?

306
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:05,159
甜心  你沒事吧
Honey, are you okay?

307
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:09,246
- 我在這兒  我沒事  <i>- 真的嗎?</i>
- I'm right here. I'm fine. <i>- Are you sure you're all right?</i>

308
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:12,418
- 狗叫什麼名字?  - 麥克斯
- What's the dog's name? - Max.

309
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,085
吉納  伍飛怎麼了?
Hey, Janelle. What's wrong with Wolfie?

310
00:38:15,169 --> 00:38:17,754
我聽見它在叫  它沒事吧?
I can hear him barking. Is he okay?

311
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:21,558
伍飛很好  甜心  它很好
Wolfie's fine, honey. Wolfie's just fine.

312
00:38:21,798 --> 00:38:23,118
你在哪兒?
Where are you?

313
00:38:25,018 --> 00:38:26,618
你的養父母都死了
Your foster parents are dead.

314
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:06,011
說清楚點
I need a minute here.

315
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:10,432
你說這機器能模仿一切事物?
You're telling me that this thing can imitate anything it touches?

316
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:13,435
只要它能接觸到的都行
Anything it samples by physical contact.

317
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:14,937
厲害
Get real.

318
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,774
那它也能變成一包香煙?
It could disguise itself as a pack of cigarettes?

319
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,818
不行  只能變成類似它大小的物體
No, only an object of equal size.

320
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,438
那為何不變成顆炸彈來殺我?
Why not just become a bomb or something to get me?

321
00:39:23,538 --> 00:39:25,530
它無法變成很複雜的機器
It can't form complex machines.

322
00:39:25,598 --> 00:39:27,798
像槍枝  炸藥  化學品等
Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.

323
00:39:27,848 --> 00:39:31,411
但它可以變出一個固態金屬形狀
It doesn't work that way. But it can form solid metal shapes.

324
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:34,539
- 像是什麼?  - 像刀  能刺的武器
- Like what? - Knives and stabbing weapons.

325
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:38,294
這些是電視監視器照的
These were taken by a video surveillance camera...

326
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:41,881
1984年  在西城警局
at the West Highland Police Station in 1984.

327
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:44,856
那晚他殺了17名警察
He killed 17 police officers that night.

328
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,137
都是有家室的人
Men with families...

329
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,140
有子女
children.

330
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,144
這是今天在一個購物中心照的
These were taken at a mall in Reseda...

331
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,438
就在今天
today.

332
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:02,817
康納小姐  我們知道你認得此人
Miss Connor, we know you know who this guy is.

333
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,991
我還要告訴你  令郎也失蹤了
I just sat here and told you that your son is missing...

334
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,911
他的養父母雙雙遇害
that the foster parents have been murdered.

335
00:40:12,976 --> 00:40:15,036
我們知道此人涉有重嫌
We know this guy's involved.

336
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:19,125
此事你一點也不關心?  你關心嗎?
Doesn't that mean anything to you? Don't you care?

337
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:27,496
我們是在浪費時間  咱們走
We're wasting our time. Let's go.

338
00:40:27,756 --> 00:40:29,856
抱歉各位
Sorry, guys.

339
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:34,682
她越來越與現實生活脫節了
She's grown more disconnected from reality as time goes on.

340
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,976
恐怕她幫不了你們的忙
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

341
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,271
也許等她神智清醒時就可以了  我會通知你們的
If she clears at all and can give us anything, I'll call you.

342
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:41,981
好吧
Sure.

343
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:45,072
道格  請帶她回房去
Douglas, take her back to her room, please.

344
00:40:45,136 --> 00:40:46,277
是
Yes, sir.

345
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,948
我們走
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

346
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,075
好長一段時間
You see...

347
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,370
我們曾在尼加拉瓜或其他的地方待過
we spent a lot of time in Nicaragua and places like that.

348
00:40:56,621 --> 00:41:00,959
她有陣子跟退役的綠色貝雷帽士兵混
For a while there, she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy...

349
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:02,418
弄了不少槍
running guns.

350
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:05,421
然後又找了些人
Then there were some other guys.

351
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:07,507
她向任何可以學習的人吸取經驗
She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from...

352
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,843
以便將我造就成偉大的軍事領袖
so she could teach me how to be this great military leader.

353
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,597
後來她被捕了
Then she gets busted.

354
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:18,309
我媽瘋狂的舉動把我也弄糊塗了
It's like, "Sorry, kid, your mom's a psycho. Didn't you know?"

355
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,440
好像她教我相信的一切是狗屎
Like everything I've been brought up to believe is all made-up bullshit.

356
00:41:24,496 --> 00:41:26,496
我痛恨這一點
I hated her for that.

357
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,074
但她說的一切都是真的
But everything she said was true.

358
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:36,327
她知道的
She knew...

359
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,582
但沒人肯相信她
and nobody believed her...

360
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,252
連我在內
not even me.

361
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,089
我們得把她弄出醫院
Listen. We gotta get her out of there.

362
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,551
否決  T-1000精明狡猾
Negative. The T-1000's highest probability for success now...

363
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:54,679
現在可能已經變成莎拉·康納  等你去自投羅網
will be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.

364
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,848
那她會怎樣?
Great. What happens to her?

365
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,809
模仿的對象必須消滅
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.

366
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:03,146
糟了  你怎麼不早說?  我們得馬上走
Shit! Why didn't you tell me? We gotta go right now!

367
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,315
否決  這不是我任務的重點
Negative. It's not a mission priority.

368
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:07,567
但這是我的重點
Fuck you! She's a priority to me!

369
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:13,406
混蛋  你是怎麼回事?  救命
Goddamn it! What's your problem? Help!

370
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,283
這對我們的任務毫無用處
This does not help our mission.

371
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,827
救命  把這瘋子趕走
Get this psycho off of me! Help!

372
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,955
救命  救命呀  他要綁架我  把這瘋子趕走
I'm being kidnapped! Get this psycho off of me!

373
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,081
放手
Let me go!

374
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:28,421
你為何那樣做?
Why did you do that?

375
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,423
因為你命令我"放手"
Because you told me to.

376
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,677
什麼?
What?

377
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,684
你得照我的話去做  對吧?
You have to do what I say?

378
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:43,978
那是我任務的一個最高原則
That's one of my mission parameters.

379
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:48,596
證明呀  用一隻腳站立
Prove it. Stand on one foot.

380
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,320
好
Yes!

381
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:58,117
真酷  只聽我命令的終結者
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

382
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:00,870
你沒事吧  孩子?
You okay, kid?

383
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,330
滾開  別煩我
Take a hike, bozo.

384
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,999
我們別插手啦
Let's get outta here, man.

385
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,036
去你的  混球
Fuck you, you little dipshit!

386
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,170
混球?
Dipshit?

387
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,466
把腳放下
Put your leg down.

388
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:18,388
- 你敢叫<i>我</i>混球  - 只是想幫忙
- Did you call <i>moi</i> a dipshit? - Just trying to help this punk.

389
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,807
給這小子點顏色瞧瞧
Grab this guy.

390
00:43:22,446 --> 00:43:23,646
放開我
Get him off of me!

391
00:43:23,696 --> 00:43:25,770
現在誰是混球?
Now who's the dipshit...

392
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,647
- 你個草包  - 放手
- you jock douche bag? - Get off!

393
00:43:34,937 --> 00:43:35,936
不
No.

394
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,200
把槍放下  快
Put the gun down now!

395
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:42,495
- 離開這兒  - 兄弟  咱們快走
- Get outta here! - Come on. Let's split!

396
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,379
天呀  你會把那人給殺了
You were gonna kill that guy!

397
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,631
當然  我是終結者
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

398
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:58,469
仔細聽我說  好嗎?
Listen to me very carefully, okay?

399
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:01,889
你現在不再是終結者  好嗎?
You're not a Terminator anymore, all right?

400
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,392
聽懂了嗎?
You got that?

401
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,728
你就是不能隨便到處殺人
You just can't go around killing people.

402
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:07,854
為什麼?
Why?

403
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,982
什麼意思?  反正就是不行
What do you mean, why? 'Cause you can't.

404
00:44:11,036 --> 00:44:11,976
為什麼?
Why?

405
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:15,036
因為你就是不能  好嗎?  這件事你得信任我
Because you just can't, okay? Trust me on this.

406

我要去救我媽

他們已經來了一個多小時

That's one. Now, don't move.

你想幹什麼?
What are you going to do?

426
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:59,158
我們停下來幹什麼?
Why do we stop now?

427
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:04,246
你得保證絕不殺人  好嗎?
You gotta promise me you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

428
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:06,916
- 好  - 你發誓
- Right. - Swear?

429
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:08,500
什麼?
What?

430
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:11,670
舉手說  "我絕不殺人"
Just put up your hand and say, "I swear I won't kill anyone."

00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,819
王八蛋  你開槍打我
You son of a bitch! You shot me!

瘋子
Crazy bastard!

別再開槍了  別殺我
Don't shoot me again. Don't kill me.

大家別激動

- Open the door. - It ain't gonna happen.

445

別緊張
Take it easy, Sarah.

446
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:22,283
行不通的  我知道你不是殺手
It won't work. You're no killer. I don't believe you can do it.

447
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:25,327
反正你們都得死  索大夫  你知道我很認真
You're already dead. Everybody dies. You know I believe it.

448
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:27,454

退回去
Get back!

453

我會讓他死翹翹  我保證
I'll pump him full of this shit. I swear!

454
00:53:40,996 --> 00:53:42,296
退後
Back!

455
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,496

Don't move!

456
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:46,974
丟掉木棍
Drop the shit!

抓住她
Get her!

463

Hurry up! Open the door! The door's locked!

464
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:52,623
快
Let's go! Open it!

465
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:57,044
- 鎖被弄壞了  - 想辦法打開
- She broke it off. - Open it!

466
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:04,802
往那邊  快追
Let's go around! Come on! Move it!

467
00:55:29,976 --> 00:55:30,978

469
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,043
媽  等等
Mom, wait!

470
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:45,884
休想逃走
Come back here!

471
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,973
不
No.

472
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:52,141
- 救她呀  - 你別來

473
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:54,810
- 快幫忙  - 他會把我們都殺死的

474
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:57,354

475
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,065
他會殺死我們的
He'll kill us all!

476
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:24,590
媽  你沒事吧  媽
Mom, are you okay? Mom!

477
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,472
想活命就跟我走
Come with me if you want to live.

478
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:34,099
不要緊  媽  他是來幫忙的
It's okay, Mom. He's here to help.

479
00:56:58,790 --> 00:56:59,833
快走
Go.

480
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:34,701
它是什麼東西?  這到底是怎麼回事?
What the fuck is it? What the fuck is going on?

481
00:57:49,496 --> 00:57:50,496
趴下
Get down.

482
00:58:08,396 --> 00:58:09,296
媽
Mon.

483
00:58:27,296 --> 00:58:28,839
下車
Out of the car!

484
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,383
立刻下車
Right now!

485
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:56,908
走
Go!

486
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:09,379
子彈沒了
I'm out.

487
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:18,096
- 快點  - 給

00:59:31,652 --> 00:59:33,612
最後一個
Last one!

490
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,096
抓牢
Hang on.

491
01:00:08,796 --> 01:00:09,896
好了
Ready!

492
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:16,896
約翰
John.

493
01:00:24,136 --> 01:00:25,856
你來開
You, drive.

494
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:21,219
甩掉他了  後面沒人
He's not back there. There's nobody behind us.

495
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:23,296
- 你沒事吧?  - 沒事
- Are you all right? - Yeah.

496
01:01:25,696 --> 01:01:27,216
你看的到路?
Can you see anything?

497
01:01:27,996 --> 01:01:29,396
我看的一清二楚
I see everything.

498
01:01:29,946 --> 01:01:32,036
"路況能見度提升"

499
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:33,696
酷
Cool.

500
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:39,096
過來
Come here.

501
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,912
我說過我沒事
I said I was okay.

502
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,874
約翰  你來找我真是愚蠢
John, it was stupid of you to go there.

503
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:54,085
你該有自知之明的
You have to be smarter than that.

504
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:55,796
你差點連命都送掉
You were almost killed.

505
01:01:56,896 --> 01:01:58,896
你到底在想什麼?
What were you thinking?

506
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:02,276
你不該冒險  為我也不行
You cannot risk yourself, even for me.

507
01:02:02,296 --> 01:02:05,472
你的命太重要了
Do you understand? You're too important.

508
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:08,225
你懂嗎?
Do you understand?

509
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:12,229
可是...
But...

510
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:17,609
我必須把你從那兒就出來  對不起
I had to get you out of that place. I'm sorry.

511
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:21,238
我不需要你協助  我自有辦法
I didn't need your help. I can take care of myself.

512
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:30,080
你的眼睛怎麼了?
What's wrong with your eyes?

513
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,458
沒什麼
Nothing.

514
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:45,846
你又是什麼來頭?
So, what's your story?

515
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:57,482
你沒事?
You okay?

516
01:02:57,566 --> 01:02:58,984
很好
Fine.

517
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:04,155
這機車真不錯
Say, that's a nice bike.

518
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,346
輕點行嗎?  老粗
Watch it, lug nuts.

519
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:39,274
你知道自己在幹什麼嗎?
Listen, do you know what you're doing?

520
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:42,152
我對人體構造非常瞭解
I have detailed files on human anatomy.

521
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:45,030
我想也是
I bet.

522
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:48,116
那使你更容易殺人  是吧?
Makes you a more efficient killer, right?

523
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:49,326
沒錯
Correct.

524
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:57,375
你被擊中時會痛嗎?
Does it hurt when you get shot?

525
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:01,880
我感到受損  亦可稱為"疼痛"
I sense injuries. The data could be called "pain."

526
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:06,134
約翰  幫我調整燈光
John, help me with the light.

527
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,511
- 會痊瘉嗎?  - 會的
- Will these heal up? - Yes.

528
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:12,496
那就好  你若不像人  對我們就沒用
Good. If you can't pass for human, you're not much good to us.

529
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:15,602
你能活多久?
How long do you live? I mean, last. Whatever.

530
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:18,980
我的電池可維持120年
A hundred and twenty years with my existing power cell.

531
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:21,983
你能學習你電腦中還未輸入過的事嗎?
Can you learn stuff that you haven't been programmed with...

532
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:23,485
使你能夠
so you can be...

533
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:27,447
更像人類?
you know, more human...

534
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,976
這樣你才不會像個傻蛋
and not such a dork all the time?

535
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:35,186
我的中央處理器是神經元處理器  也是學習型電腦
My CPU is a neural net processor, a learning computer.

536
01:04:35,269 --> 01:04:39,325
我們外出時天網會將開關設置為"只可讀取"
But Skynet presets the switch to read-only when we're sent out alone.

537
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,000
酷
Cool.

538
01:05:12,784 --> 01:05:14,703
現在開始學習吧
Are we learning yet?

539
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:30,093
我們得盡量遠離這座城市
We have to get as far away from the city as possible.

540
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:35,432
往南走
Just head south.

541
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,776
時速別超過65英里
Keep it under 65.

542
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:48,862
- 否則會被交警攔下  - 確認
- We don't want to be pulled over. - Affirmative.

543
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:50,930
不  不不
No, no, no.

544
01:05:52,074 --> 01:05:54,576
你得學人類說話的方式
You gotta listen to the way people talk.

545
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:58,163
你不能說"確認"那種鳥話
You don't say "affirmative" or some shit like that.

546
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:00,582
你要說  <i>"沒問題"</i>
You say, <i>"No problemo."</i>

547
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:04,586
如果有人找碴  你就說  "有種試試看"
If someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say, "Eat me."

548
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:08,965
如果要解決掉他們  就說<i>"拜拜了  寶貝"</i>
And if you want to shine them on, it's <i>"Hasta la vista, baby."</i>

549
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:11,630
拜拜了  寶貝
Hasta la vista, baby.

550
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:14,304
對  或者說  "去死吧  精蟲"
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."

551
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:17,432
有人生氣  你就說  "冷靜點"
If someone gets upset, you say, "Chill out."

552
01:06:17,516 --> 01:06:18,892
或者你也可以自由發揮
Or you can do combinations.

553
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:21,978
冷靜點  精蟲
Chill out, dick-wad.

554
01:06:22,813 --> 01:06:24,815
對  看  你真的會了
That's great. See? You're getting it.

555
01:06:25,124 --> 01:06:26,100
沒問題
No problemo.

556
01:06:41,576 --> 01:06:43,495
要吃點薯條嗎?
Want some of my fries?

557
01:06:53,505 --> 01:06:55,965
- 你需要幫忙嗎?  - 不用
- Need any help? - No.

558
01:06:56,685 --> 01:06:58,505
- 我殺死你了  - 不  你沒有
- I got you! - No, you didn't!

559
01:06:58,605 --> 01:07:00,745
- 你死了  - 才沒有呢
- I got you! - No, you didn't!

560
01:07:05,505 --> 01:07:07,005
去你的  混球
I got you!

561
01:07:07,477 --> 01:07:10,480
我們撐不過去  對吧
We're not gonna make it, are we?

562
01:07:12,524 --> 01:07:13,733
我是指人類
People, I mean.

563
01:07:16,903 --> 01:07:18,985
你們天性便有自我毀滅傾向
It's in your nature to destroy yourselves.

564
01:07:19,823 --> 01:07:22,742
對  真無聊  是吧?
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

565
01:07:22,826 --> 01:07:26,079
快住手  要不掐斷你們脖子
Break it up before I wring both of your necks.

566
01:07:27,872 --> 01:07:30,959
我要知道"天網"系統的起源
I need to know how Skynet gets built.

567
01:07:31,042 --> 01:07:32,293
是誰研究出來的?
Who's responsible?

568
01:07:32,377 --> 01:07:35,922
直接負責的人是莫斯·戴森
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennett Dyson.

569
01:07:36,005 --> 01:07:37,715
誰呀?
Who is that?

570
01:07:37,799 --> 01:07:41,719
塞柏電腦公司特別企劃室主任
He's the director of special projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

571
01:07:44,514 --> 01:07:46,266
為何是他?
Why him?

572
01:07:46,349 --> 01:07:49,865
數月內他會研製出新型微電腦
In a few months, he creates a revolutionary type of microprocessor.

573
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:52,405
然後呢?
Go on. Then what?

574
01:07:53,231 --> 01:07:56,151
三年內塞柏會成為軍方電腦來源
In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier...

575
01:07:56,225 --> 01:07:57,985
負責高階研發
of military computer systems.

576
01:07:58,695 --> 01:08:01,614
所有轟炸機都會裝載塞柏的電腦系統
All Stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers...

577
01:08:01,698 --> 01:08:03,158
成為無人操作機型
becoming fully unmanned.

578
01:08:03,241 --> 01:08:06,286
然後它創造了完美的運作記錄
Afterwards they fly with a perfect operational record.

579
01:08:06,369 --> 01:08:08,997
天網計劃法案正式通過
The Skynet funding bill is passed.

580
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:12,375
1997年8月4日  電腦系統上線
The system goes on-line on August 4, 1997.

581
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:15,628
它迅速掌握戰略防衛系統
Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.

582
01:08:15,712 --> 01:08:18,423
天網電腦以極快速度吸取經驗
Skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate.

583
01:08:18,506 --> 01:08:23,305
它產生自我意識  時間為8月29日上午2時14分
It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29.

584
01:08:23,887 --> 01:08:26,472
人類驚慌失措  準備應變
In a panic, they try to pull the plug.

585
01:08:27,599 --> 01:08:29,851
- 但天網卻先發制人  - 是的
- Skynet fights back. - Yes.

586
01:08:29,934 --> 01:08:32,687
它向俄羅斯境內目標發射飛彈
It launches its missiles against the targets in Russia.

587
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:35,815
為何攻擊俄國?  他們現在不是我們的朋友嗎?
Why attack Russia? Aren't they our friends now?

588
01:08:35,899 --> 01:08:40,405
天網知道俄方反擊便可消滅美國
Skynet knows the Russian counterattack will eliminate its enemies over here.

589
01:08:40,505 --> 01:08:41,985
天啦
Jesus.

590
01:08:44,616 --> 01:08:46,865
你對戴森瞭解多少?
How much do you know about Dyson?

591
01:08:48,703 --> 01:08:50,622
我有他的詳細資料
I have detailed files.

592
01:08:51,831 --> 01:08:53,791
我要知道一切
I want to know everything.

593
01:08:55,001 --> 01:08:59,088
他的長相  住址  一切
What he looks like, where he lives, everything.

594
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,936
在車上等著
Wait in the car.

595
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:09,396
你真性急  康納
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

596
01:10:10,547 --> 01:10:12,546
你也是
You too.

597
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:31,686
約翰
Hey, big John.

598
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:33,437
你好
What's up?

599
01:10:33,536 --> 01:10:34,936
他是誰?
Who is this guy?

600
01:10:35,036 --> 01:10:37,024
他沒問題  他跟我來的
He's cool, Enrique. He's with me.

601
01:10:37,108 --> 01:10:40,277
他是  包伯叔
He's... Uncle Bob.

602
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:42,571
包伯叔  這是恩裏克
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

603
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:44,407
包伯叔?
Uncle Bob, huh?

604
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:47,516
好吧  自己人
Okay.

605
01:10:53,736 --> 01:10:54,936
要喝嗎?
Drink?

606
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:01,549
包伯叔?
"Uncle Bob"?

607
01:11:03,551 --> 01:11:06,345
你們很有名  都上了電視
You're pretty famous, all over the goddamn TV.

608
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:09,098
條子就像瘋狗似的
Pictures of you, John, your big friend here.

609
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:11,142
想揪你們出來呢
Cops are going nuts looking for you.

610
01:11:15,062 --> 01:11:19,024
我需要衣物  食物  和一輛卡車
I just came for my stuff. I need clothes, food and a truck.

611
01:11:19,036 --> 01:11:21,336
要不要我連假牙都一起給你?
How about the fillings in my teeth?

612
01:11:21,436 --> 01:11:23,536
現在就要
Now, Enrique.

613
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:27,216
你們也去  去拿武器
You two, you're on weapons detail.

614
01:11:27,612 --> 01:11:28,701
走吧
Come on, let's go.

615
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,223
我媽有個特點
One thing about my mom...

616
01:11:53,517 --> 01:11:55,478
她總是未雨綢繆
she always plans ahead.

617
01:12:06,136 --> 01:12:07,364
好極了
Excellent.

618
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,670
這是最好的車  但缺起動馬達
This is my best truck, but the starter motor's gone.

619
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:23,672
你有時間等它裝好嗎?
You got time to change it out?

620
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:27,092
- 可以  我要等午夜之後再越過邊境  - 那好
- Yeah. I'm gonna wait till dark to cross the border. - Okay.

621
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,500
我在這種地方長大
See, I grew up in places like this...

622
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:34,180
我還以為人就是這樣過活
so I just thought that's how people lived...

623
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:36,436
駕駛著直升機
riding around in helicopters...

624
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:38,605
學習如何炸東西
learning how to blow shit up.

625
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:45,028
很適合你
That's definitely you.

626
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:59,260
與我媽來往的男人都是怪人
Most of the guys my mom hung around with were geeks...

627
01:12:59,496 --> 01:13:02,999
但有個傢伙倒很酷
but there was this one guy, he was kinda cool.

628
01:13:03,082 --> 01:13:05,001
他教我玩這些
He taught me engines.

629
01:13:05,084 --> 01:13:07,253
撐住這兒
Hold here.

630
01:13:07,337 --> 01:13:09,756
後來他們還是分手了
Mom screwed it up, of course.

631
01:13:09,839 --> 01:13:12,258
她總是在談審判日等等之類的話題
She'd always tell 'em about Judgment Day...

632
01:13:12,342 --> 01:13:15,136
也許直到今天
and me being this world leader.

633
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:17,180
她腦裏仍只想這一件事
That'd be all she wrote.

634
01:13:18,515 --> 01:13:19,900
請把鉗子給我
Torque wrench, please.

635
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:22,800
拿去
Here.

636
01:13:23,186 --> 01:13:26,300
真希望能見到我生父
I wish I could've met my real dad.

637
01:13:26,481 --> 01:13:28,140
你會的
You will.

638
01:13:28,316 --> 01:13:30,485
對
Yeah, I guess.

639
01:13:30,568 --> 01:13:33,900
那時我已經45歲了
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

640
01:13:34,489 --> 01:13:38,201
我會派他回到1984年
They sent him back through time to 1984.

641
01:13:38,284 --> 01:13:39,702
天啦
Man.

642
01:13:41,246 --> 01:13:43,706
他現在還沒出生呢
He hasn't even been born yet.

643
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,418
真不可思議
It messes with your head.

644
01:13:50,171 --> 01:13:53,091
- 把螺絲帽給我  - 給
- The other bolt. - Oh. Here.

645
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:02,976
她只和他共處了一個晚上
Mom and him were only together for one night.

646
01:14:03,059 --> 01:14:05,520
我想她仍愛著他
She still loves him, I guess.

647
01:14:05,603 --> 01:14:08,481
有時我看見她在哭
I see her crying sometimes.

648
01:14:08,565 --> 01:14:12,569
當然啦  她完全否認  她說那是有異物吹進眼裏
She denies it totally, of course, like she got something stuck in her eye.

649
01:14:17,532 --> 01:14:18,950
你們為何哭泣?
Why do you cry?

650
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:21,661
- 你是說人類?  - 對
- You mean people? - Yeah.

651
01:14:21,744 --> 01:14:23,121
我不知道
I don't know.

652
01:14:23,204 --> 01:14:25,290
他們就是會哭
We just cry...

653
01:14:25,373 --> 01:14:27,917
尤其是"傷心"的時候
you know, when it hurts.

654
01:14:34,007 --> 01:14:35,758
是"傷"造成的?
Pain causes it?

655
01:14:36,843 --> 01:14:38,970
不  那不一樣
No. It's different.

656
01:14:39,053 --> 01:14:42,348
雖然你沒事  但傷心時就會哭
It's when there's nothing wrong with you, but you hurt anyway.

657
01:14:42,432 --> 01:14:44,017
- 懂嗎?  - 不懂
- You get it? - No.

658
01:14:45,268 --> 01:14:46,978
那才像話
All right, my man!

659
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,500
沒問題
No problemo.

660
01:14:48,813 --> 01:14:50,440
擊掌慶祝
Give me five.

661
01:14:52,483 --> 01:14:54,700
像這樣撐開手掌  來
Just put out your hand like this, come on.

662
01:14:55,945 --> 01:15:00,283
很好  拍打我的手  該你了  你來擊掌
All right! Now hit me. Give me five. Do the same thing.

663
01:15:00,373 --> 01:15:01,349
很好
All right!

664
01:15:04,996 --> 01:15:07,457
好  很好  來個高的
Okay, that's good. Up high.

665
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,400
低的
Five low.

666
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:11,540
你慢了
Too slow.

667
01:15:14,464 --> 01:15:16,716
我是在開玩笑  再來一次
I'm just kidding. One more time.

668
01:15:16,799 --> 01:15:19,010
很好  接著來
Good. Now try it.

669
01:15:19,093 --> 01:15:21,054
來  打我一掌
Now do me. Give me five.

670
01:15:22,513 --> 01:15:27,060
<i>看到約翰和機器人在一起  突然真相大白了</i>
<i>Watching John with the machine, it was suddenly so clear.</i>

671

<i>It would never leave him, never hurt him...</i>

<i>在這瘋狂世界裏</i>
<i>In an insane world...</i>

681
01:15:58,007 --> 01:15:59,967
<i>這是最佳選擇</i>
<i>it was the sanest choice.</i>

682
01:17:37,732 --> 01:17:39,692
我們來玩玩這個
Hey, let's try this one.

683
01:17:45,323 --> 01:17:47,492
來吧
There we go.

684
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:14,000
"不是命運"

685
01:19:33,598 --> 01:19:36,100
她叫你們按原計劃向南走
She said go south with him like you planned.

686
01:19:36,183 --> 01:19:38,394
- 她明天會趕上你們  - 媽
- She'll meet you tomorrow. - Mom!

687
01:19:40,187 --> 01:19:41,355
媽等等
Mom, wait!

688
01:19:56,621 --> 01:19:58,080
"不是命運"
"No fate."

689
01:19:59,290 --> 01:20:01,751
命運是要自己開創的
No fate but what we make.

690
01:20:03,878 --> 01:20:05,880
我的父親告訴她的
My father told her this.

691
01:20:08,424 --> 01:20:12,720
是未來的我讓我父親告訴她的
I made him memorize it in the future as a message to her.

692
01:20:14,388 --> 01:20:16,307
算了
Never mind.

693
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:19,727
整件事就是這樣
Okay, the whole thing goes...

694
01:20:19,810 --> 01:20:22,521
一切尚未成為定局
The future's not set.

695
01:20:22,605 --> 01:20:26,108
未來仍可以自己去開創
There's no fate but what we make for ourselves.

696
01:20:26,192 --> 01:20:29,195
她想改變未來?
She intends to change the future.

697
01:20:29,278 --> 01:20:30,738
對  我猜也是
Yeah, I guess.

698
01:20:32,281 --> 01:20:34,116
糟了
Oh, shit!

699
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:36,118
- 戴森  - 對
- Dyson. - Yeah.

700
01:20:36,202 --> 01:20:39,705
一定是的  莫斯·戴森
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

701
01:20:39,789 --> 01:20:41,791
她想要殺了戴森
She's gonna blow him away.

702
01:20:41,874 --> 01:20:43,960
來  咱們走
Come on! Let's go!

703
01:20:44,348 --> 01:20:45,331
快啊
Come on!

704
01:20:56,347 --> 01:20:58,391
事實上  這樣做非常危險
This is tactically dangerous.

705
01:20:58,474 --> 01:20:59,600
開快點
Drive faster.

706
01:20:59,684 --> 01:21:02,186
T-1000跟我一樣瞭解情況
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.

707
01:21:02,269 --> 01:21:05,690
它知道我知道的一切  它還能預測敵人的行動
It knows what I know. It might anticipate this move.

708
01:21:05,773 --> 01:21:07,900
我不管  咱們得阻止她
I don't care. We gotta stop her.

709
01:21:08,359 --> 01:21:10,440
殺死戴森的確有可能阻止戰爭
Killing Dyson might prevent the war.

710
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:14,300
我不管  你還沒學通嗎?
I don't care! Haven't you learned anything yet?

711
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:17,100
你還不明白為何不能亂殺人嗎?
Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?

712
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:26,107
丹尼  叫你去睡覺  我說真的
Danny, I told you to go to bed, I'm not kidding.

713
01:21:26,207 --> 01:21:28,927
再玩一會兒就好  媽
Just a couple of minutes, Mom!

714
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:39,812
丹尼  睡覺時間到了
Danny, your time is up!

715
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,815
快刷牙上床
Come brush your teeth and get to bed.

716
01:22:11,473 --> 01:22:12,473
丹尼
Danny.

Daddy!

718

這不是遊戲  快逃
Danny, go! Go!

719
01:22:30,273 --> 01:22:31,273
莫斯
Miles.

720
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:38,913
- 特瑞莎  跑  - 我的天啊
- Tarissa, run! - Oh, my God!

721
01:22:46,003 --> 01:22:48,047
快帶丹尼走  快逃
Just take Danny and run!

722
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:49,381
快逃
Run!

723
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:51,217
我的天呀
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

724
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:11,111
爹地
Daddy!

725
01:23:11,273 --> 01:23:12,273
丹尼
Danny.

726
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,281
誰都不許動
Nobody fucking move!

727
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:16,367
別傷害我爸
Don't hurt my daddy!

728
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:17,993
趴到地上
On the floor, bitch.

729
01:23:18,077 --> 01:23:19,973
趴下
Get down now!

730
01:23:21,121 --> 01:23:22,206
讓開
Get out of the way!

731
01:23:22,289 --> 01:23:23,749
別傷害他
Don't hurt him!

732
01:23:25,251 --> 01:23:27,253
讓開  否則我開槍
Get on the floor now!

733
01:23:30,297 --> 01:23:32,007
饒了孩子吧
Just let the boy go.

734
01:23:32,091 --> 01:23:33,676
你閉嘴
Shut up. Shut up.

735
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:35,052
閉嘴
Shut up!

736
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:37,721
都是你的錯  混蛋
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

737
01:23:37,805 --> 01:23:40,057
- 都是你的錯  - 什麼?
- It's all your fault! - What?

738
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,268
我不會讓你得逞的
I'm not gonna let you do it.

739
01:24:34,278 --> 01:24:36,363
糟了  太遲了
Shit! We're too late!

740
01:24:40,868 --> 01:24:41,994
看看他們
Check them.

741
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:47,666
看著我  媽
Look at me, Mom.

742
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:49,960
你受傷了?
Are you hurt?

743
01:24:50,430 --> 01:24:51,409
看著我
Look at me.

744
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:55,674
我幾乎
I almost...

745
01:24:56,273 --> 01:24:57,473
我下不了手
I almost...

746
01:25:07,311 --> 01:25:09,646
放心吧
It'll be okay.

747
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:11,690
一定還有辦法的  真的
We'll figure something out. Okay?

748
01:25:13,275 --> 01:25:14,902
相信我吧
I promise.

749
01:25:18,197 --> 01:25:21,158
你是來阻止我的?
You came here to stop me.

750
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:23,994
對
Yeah, I did.

751
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:28,874
我愛你  約翰
I love you, John.

752
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:32,127
我一直愛著你
I always have.

753
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:35,464
我知道
I know.

754
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:44,681
子彈貫穿
Deep penetration.

755
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:48,185
沒有擊碎骨頭
No shattered bone.

756
01:25:48,268 --> 01:25:51,230
把傷口壓著就能止住血了
Hold here. The pressure should stop the bleeding.

757
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:03,409
你們是誰?
Who are you people?

758
01:26:04,368 --> 01:26:05,786
告訴他
Show him.

759
01:26:08,455 --> 01:26:12,626
丹尼  你跟我走好嗎?  帶我看看你房間
Danny, I want you to come with me right now. Show me your room.

760
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:54,334
我的天呀
Oh, my God.

761
01:26:54,418 --> 01:26:57,087
仔細聽我說
Now listen to me very carefully.

762
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:07,097
<i>戴森聽著終結者的解說</i>
<i>Dyson listened while the Terminator laid it all down.</i>

<i>天網  審判日</i>
<i>Skynet. Judgment Day.</i>

<i>The history of things to come.</i>

<i>知道自己的研發成果最終將會</i>
<i>It's not every day that you find out you're responsible...</i>

我想我要嘔吐了
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

你是為了
You're judging me...

我還未做的事懲罰我?
on things I haven't even done yet.

771
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:44,009
我怎會知道?
How were we supposed to know?

772
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:48,153
對
Yeah.

773
01:27:48,514 --> 01:27:50,333
沒錯
Right.

774
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:53,101
你怎會知道?
How were you supposed to know?

氫彈就是你這種人發明的
Fucking men like you built the hydrogen bomb.

也是你這種人
Men like you...

778
01:28:05,906 --> 01:28:07,866
你以為你很有創造力
You think you're so creative.

779
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:12,371
你根本就不知道創造的意義
You don't know what it's like to really create something...

780
01:28:12,454 --> 01:28:14,581
創造生命
to create a life...

781
01:28:14,665 --> 01:28:16,208
是感覺它在體內成長
to feel it growing inside you.

782
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:19,211
你只會創造死亡和毀滅
All you know how to create is death and destruction.

783
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:20,963
媽
Mom!

784
01:28:21,046 --> 01:28:24,800
你得說些有建設性的話  好嗎?
We need to be a little more constructive here. Okay?

785
01:28:24,883 --> 01:28:27,333
我們仍要阻止戰爭的  對吧?
We still have to stop this from happening, don't we?

786
01:28:27,453 --> 01:28:29,888
但我以為
But I thought...

787
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:33,976
我們是要通過改變現在的事  從而改變未來的事嗎?
Aren't we changing things right now, changing the way it goes?

788
01:28:34,059 --> 01:28:35,173
沒錯
That's right.

789
01:28:35,653 --> 01:28:38,513
本來就快做出超級新電腦
There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor. Not now.

790
01:28:38,939 --> 01:28:42,401
現在一切免談  我不幹了  我明天就辭職
Forget it. I'm out of it. I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.

791
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:44,361
那還不夠好
That's not good enough.

792
01:28:44,444 --> 01:28:46,405
不能讓別人繼續完成你的工作
No one must follow your work.

793
01:28:46,473 --> 01:28:47,973
好吧
Right.

794
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:52,744
那得摧毀實驗室的一切裝備
All right, then we have to destroy all the stuff at the lab...

- Do you know about the chip? - What chip?

801
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:08,613
他們把它鎖在金庫裏  是跟你一樣的機器人身上的
It's at Cyberdyne. It's from the other one like you.

802
01:29:08,693 --> 01:29:11,054
第一代終結者的記憶體
The CPU from the first Terminator.

803
01:29:11,138 --> 01:29:13,515
混蛋  我就知道
Son of a bitch! I knew it!

804
01:29:13,599 --> 01:29:16,310
他們不准我們問晶片是哪兒來的
They told us not to ask where they got it.

805
01:29:16,393 --> 01:29:18,729
真聰明的混蛋
Those lying motherfuckers.

806
01:29:18,812 --> 01:29:20,606
它很可怕  但非常先進
It's scary stuff. Radically advanced.

807
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:21,815
它被砸爛了
It was smashed.

808
01:29:21,898 --> 01:29:25,527
無法運作  但它給了我許多不可思議的靈感
It didn't work, but it gave us ideas, took us in new directions.

809
01:29:25,611 --> 01:29:27,613
前所未有
Things we would've never...

810

我的工作全是以它為基礎
All my work was based on it.

811
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:33,785
必須摧毀它
It must be destroyed.

你能帶我們通過警衛嗎?
Can you get us in? Past security?

I think so, yeah. When?

01:30:48,068 --> 01:30:50,153
我只想帶他們上樓四處瞧瞧
take 'em upstairs and show 'em around.

823
01:30:50,213 --> 01:30:53,448
戴森先生  你也知道規定  帶客人進實驗室時
Mr. Dyson, you know the rules concerning visitors in the lab.

824
01:30:53,532 --> 01:30:55,701
我需要書面許可
I need written authorization...

825
01:30:56,743 --> 01:30:58,745
我堅持
I insist.

826
01:30:58,829 --> 01:31:00,580
你休想妄動
Don't even think about it.

827
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:13,009
行了
It's okay.

828
01:31:14,428 --> 01:31:17,583
開金庫要兩把鑰匙  而且得同時插入旋轉
It takes two keys, turned simultaneously, to open the vault.

829
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:20,559
另一支在警衛室裏
The other one is in a locker at the security station.

你不能擅離崗位的
You can't leave the desk like that!

我的卡片應該可以開啟它
My card should access this.

836

01:32:01,975 --> 01:32:04,394
- 怎麼回事?  - 可惡
- What is it? - Damn it.

838
01:32:04,478 --> 01:32:06,438
警報器已經啟動
The silent alarm's been tripped.

839
01:32:12,611 --> 01:32:15,363
它使所有啟動密碼都失效了
It's neutralized all the codes in the entire building.

840
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:17,365
現在到處都不通了
Nothing will open anywhere now.

841
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:20,285
我們得放棄此事
We have to abort.

842

不
No.

843
01:32:23,497 --> 01:32:26,917
我們幹到底
We go all the way. Okay?

844
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:32,839
你們在實驗室開始行動  我能打開這個
You guys get started on the lab. I can open this.

845
01:32:32,923 --> 01:32:35,383
- 是大鬧商場的傢伙  - 是那傢伙
- I think it's that guy from the mall. - It is.

846
01:32:35,467 --> 01:32:37,385
對  是他和那女人
Yeah. It's him and the woman.

立即總動員到這裏來
Just send everything you got in the area right now.

848
01:32:44,351 --> 01:32:47,813
我的私人密碼可能還能通
I have a personal entry code for the lab. It may still work.

849
01:32:52,317 --> 01:32:53,360
沒有用
It's no good.

850
01:32:53,443 --> 01:32:54,986
試試我的法子
Let me try mine.

851

約翰  小心
John, fire in the hole!

852
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:18,885

Wait! You can't go in there. The fire set off the Halon system.

853
01:33:26,059 --> 01:33:28,520
等幾分鐘  要讓毒氣消散
You have to wait until the gas clears.

854
01:33:31,022 --> 01:33:32,315
戴防毒面具
Put this on.
