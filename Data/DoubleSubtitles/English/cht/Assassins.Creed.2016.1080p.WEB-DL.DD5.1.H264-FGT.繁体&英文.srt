We believe that man today experiences

143
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:51,550
就會采取一定的暴力
a measure of aggression which he finds no acceptable outlets.

144
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:57,970
現在想象一下如果將 這些花費引導到其他地方
Now imagine if all these costs could be channeled elsewhere...

145
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,140
回歸進行得好嗎?
So the regression went well?

146
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,470
就是林奇
Lynch is the one.

147
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,770
阿吉拉爾的直系后裔
Direct descendent of Aguilar.

148
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,230
一切都非常清晰 這還是頭一次
Everything was clear in there, for the first time.

149
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,690
我們都夢寐以求的是什么? 一個更和平的世界
What do we all dream of? A more peaceful world.

150
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,690
你又搶了我的臺詞
I see you stole my lines again.

151
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,570
我只搶最好的
I only steal from the best.

152
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,740
神器呢?
And the artifact?

153
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,620
伊甸蘋果 它就在我們掌控之中
The Apple. It's within our grasp.

154
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,960
發生了什么? 為什么把他拉出來?
What happened in there? Why did you pull him?

155
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,210
我必須這樣 我們必須保持他的健康
I had to. We have to keep him healthy.

156
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,840
獲得他的信任 我知道他會把我們引向神器的
Earn his confidence. And I know he'll lead us to it.

157
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,050
逼他一把
Push him.

158
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,050
Animus這不是這樣工作的
That's not how the Animus works.

159
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,690
搞定了
Here you go.

160
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,030
謝謝
Thank you.

161
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,610
1917年盧瑟福分裂了原子

162
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,080
1953年沃森和克里克 發現了DNA雙螺旋
1953 Watson and Crick find a double helix.

163
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,870
2016年我的女兒
2016 my daughter

164
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,750
找到了治療暴力的方法
finds the cure for violence.

165
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,930
你總比我更聰明
You've always been brighter than me.

166
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,310
我遲到了
I'm late.

167
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,640
我要向長老匯報
I have to report to the Elders.

168
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:56,460
弗朗西斯科·利茲的 《偉大宗教法庭》1492年
Francisco Rizi's Grand Inquisition. 1492.

169
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,340
戰爭 宗教的控告
War, religious prosecution,

170
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,800
托爾克馬達神父或 任何我們組織的人
and the closest that Father Torquemada or any of our Order

171
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,680
最接近找到伊甸蘋果的一次
came to a finding the Apple of Eden.

172
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,270
你最近怎么樣我的朋友?
How are you, my friend?

173
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:08,770
還好
Well.

174
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,730
閣下
Your Excellency.

175
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,100
下周長老見面時
Next week when the Elders meet,

176
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:17,230
我們將投票結束你的 阿布斯泰戈計劃
we shall vote to discontinue your Abstergo project.

177
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,240
我們覺得每年給你的300萬
We feel that giving you 3 billion annually,

178
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,530
能花在更好的地方
could be better spent elsewhere.

179
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,870
3百萬算不了什么
Tri billion is nothing compared to...

180
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:26,660
我們贏了
We've won.

181
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,950
人們不再關注他們的公民自由
People are no longer care about their civil liberties,

182
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,660
他們在乎自己的生活標準
they care about their standard of life.

183
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:35,630
現代世界已經不再需要自由之類的觀念
The modern world has outgrown notions like freedom.

184
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,630
他們滿足于遵守
They are content to follow.

185
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,300
只要自由意志存在 威脅就存在
The threat remains while free will exists.

186
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:48,850
幾個世紀以來我們嘗試用 宗教、政治和現在的消費主義
For centuries we try with religion, with politics and now consumerism

187
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,680
來消除異議
to eliminate dissent.

188
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,890
難道不是時候來試一下科學嗎?
Isn't it the time we gave a science a try?

189
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,060
我的女兒比我們以往更接近目標
My daughter is closer than we've ever been.

190
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,070
你漂亮的女兒怎么樣了?
How is your beautiful daughter?

191
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,530
她追蹤到了伊甸蘋果的保護者
She has traced protectors of the Apple.

192
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,660
在哪兒?
Where?

193
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:11,080
安達盧西亞1492年
Andalucía, 1492.

194
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,500
后裔呢?
The descendents?

195
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,370
所有血脈都消亡了
All the blood lines have died out.

196
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,080
除了一個
But one.

197
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,210
我們已經追蹤了他過去的的五百年 追蹤到了刺客兄弟會
We've traced his back 500 years, to the Assassin's Brotherhood.

198
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,080
你的幻覺我們稱之為“出血效應”
Hallucinations are what we call the "bleeding effect."

199
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,960
你過去的影像
Images of your regression,

200
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,630
出現在你現在的視野里
laying themselves over your present day field of vision.

201
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,680
如果你允許 我能教你怎么控制它們
If you allow me, I can teach you how to control them.

202
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,810
退下都早我掌握中
Stand down. I have this.

203
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,270
別管他們
Let it be.

204
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:03,390
這到底是什么? 那個機器是干什么的?
What is it? The machine?

205
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,980
這是基因記憶
It's genetic memory.

206
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,020
通過Animus
By using the Animus,

207
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,610
我們能再歷那些造就我們的人的生活
we can relive lives of those who made us who we are.

208
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:29,210
我在那里見到的 感覺像真的
What I saw in there, it felt real.

209
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,710
就是真的
It was.

210
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,420
從某方面來說
In a way.

211
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,340
別惹我!
Don't mess with me!

212
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,180
我感覺不一樣了
I feel different now.

213
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,140
干嘛這么激動?
Why the aggression?

214
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,100
我就是個沖動的人
I'm an aggressive person.

215
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,690
這到底是什么監獄?
What kind of prison is this?

216
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,150
這不是監獄卡爾
It's not a prison, Cal.

217
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,740
如果你合作的話你能學到更多
You'll learn more if you cooperate.

218
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,490
放開我
Let me go.

219
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,040
我餓了
I'm hungry.

220
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,760
跟我來
Come with me.

221
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:42,030
林奇 1979年-現在
LYNCH 1979-present

222
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,120
這是什么?
What is this?

223
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,750
我知道你的一切卡爾
I know everything about you, Cal.

224
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:53,250
你的醫療記錄 你的心理檔案
Your medical data, your psychological profile,

225
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,170
你MAO-A基因里的變異

我知道你的寄養家庭

227
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,350
你的青少年收容所
The juvenile homes.

228
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:05,970
你是遺傳和暴力之間關聯的活例子
You are a living proof of the link between heredity and crime.

229
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,730
你怎么找到我的?
How did you find me?

230
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,770
我們找到了阿吉拉爾
We found Aguilar.

231
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,520
你被捕時你的DNA和他匹配
When you were arrested, your DNA matched his.

232
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,780
- 阿吉拉爾是誰? - 你的祖先
- Who is Aguilar? - Your ancestor.

233
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,700
他的家族都是刺客
His family were Assassins.

234
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,740
他們被圣殿騎士、托爾克馬達
They were burnt at the stake by the Templars,

235
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,700
和你看到的那個黑騎士 奧赫達燒死在刑柱上
Torquemada and the black night you saw, Ojeda.

236
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,500
阿吉拉爾扛起了刺客的大旗
Aguilar took up the Assassins' cause.

237
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,090
你經常外出嗎?
Do you go out much?

238
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,300
比你勤
More than you.

239
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:45,600
這里的其他人呢? 他們都是小白鼠嗎?
And the others in here? Are they the lab rats too?

240
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,680
他們都是刺客、殺人犯  像他們的祖先一樣
They are Assassins, murderers like their ancestors.

241
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,400
像你一樣卡爾
Like you, Cal.

242
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,070
都生來帶有暴力傾向
All born with predisposition to violence.

243
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,660
殺人犯?
Murderer?

244
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,790
- 你殺了人了 - 一個皮條客
- You killed the man. - A pimp.

245
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,790
你還會殺人么?
Would you kill again?

246
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,880
快樂的一家
Happy families.

247
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,890
她一定非常自豪
She must be very proud.

248
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,550
我怎么知道
I wouldn't know.

249
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,060
她死于刺客之手
She was killed by an Assassin.

250
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,730
像你母親一樣
Like your mother.

251
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,900
抱歉
Sorry.

252
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,320
我老爹殺了我母親
My old man killed my mother.

253
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,160
你對此有何感受?
And how does that make you feel?

254
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,660
感覺和殺死他一樣
Like killing him.

255
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,920
要么我們任其影響我們的余生
Either we let it to effect us for the rest of our lives,

256
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,170
要么我們做點什么
or we just do something about it.

257
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,260
你投向了暴力 我投向了科學
You turn to violence, I turn to science.

258
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,720
這是伊甸蘋果卡爾
It's the Apple of Eden, Cal.

259
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,060
我相信它存在
I believe it exists.

260
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:14,100
圣經告訴我們它包含著 人類第一次反抗的種子
The Bible tells us it contained the seed of man's first disobedience.

261
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,770
但我們中部分人相信
But there are those of us who believe that

262
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,280
神或某種古代文明
God or some ancient civilization

263
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:27,780
留給了我們一個路線圖來 了解為什么人類如此暴力
have left us a road map to understand why people are violent.

264
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,370
阿吉拉爾是我們所知的 最后一個擁有伊甸蘋果的人
Aguilar was the last person known to have had it in his possession.

265
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,540
我們需要你找出他把它藏在哪里了
We need you to find out where he hid it.

266
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,090
我以為我是來接受治療的
I thought I was here to be cured.

267
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,670
暴力就是種疾病
Violence is a disease.

268
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,880
像癌癥一樣
Like cancer.

269
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:49,260
并且像癌癥一樣 我們希望有一天能治愈它
And like cancer, we hope to control it one day.

270
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,020
是暴力讓我還活著
Violence is what kept me alive.

271
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,770
好吧 嚴格地說你死了
Well technically, you're dead.

272
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,820
我餓了
I'm hungry.

273
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,740
我有什么好處?
What's in it for me?

274
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,990
一旦我的研究完成 這里就不需要你了
Once my research is complete, there is no reason to keep you here.

275
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,410
我能回到自己的生活?
I get my life back?

276
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,710
比那更好你將有個新生活
Better. A new one.

277
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,590
你不是餓了么
You are hungry.

278
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,780
你不知道他是誰 他是干什么的
You don't know who he is, what he is.

279
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,570
他是個危險人物
He is a dangerous man.

280
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,410
多給他點時間埃米爾
Give him little more time, Emir.

281
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,780
他或許能證明他的骨子里流著高貴的血
Man may prove that has some noble blood in him yet.

282
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,080
坐這里怎么樣先生?

給開拓者一份牛排
Steak for the pioneer.

288
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,950
你是誰?
Who are you?

289

他們叫我穆薩

但我的名字是巴普蒂斯特 我已經死了200年了
But my name is Baptiste. I'm dead 200 years now.

291
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,920
伏都毒師
Voodoo poisoner.

292
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,880
我不會傷害任何人
I'm harmless.

293
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,600
他們在盯著你
They're watching you.

294
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,810
等著發現你是誰開拓者

295
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,440
你見過他了么?
Have you met him yet?

296
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,030
你有沒有見過他?
Have you met him yet?

297
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,370
我們都是最后保護伊甸蘋果的人我的朋友
We are the last to protect the Apple, my friend.

298
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:21,080
做錯一個選擇 你將把我們都送入無底深淵
Pick the wrong choice, you'll send us all to infinity.

299
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,750
這個
This...

300
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,340
是你的
belongs to you.

301
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,400
你將把他們直接引向它
You're going to lead them right to it.

302
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,320
不我打算吃了它
Ne, I'm going to eat it.

303
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,750
什么鬼?
What the fuck is going on?

304
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,280
他必須回到Animus
He has to go back in the Animus.

305
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,330
現在
Now.

306
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:43,580
在再次進入之前他還需要點時間
He needs more time before he goes in again.

307
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,540
我們沒時間了

308
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,170
為什么?

309
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,680
我不會拿他的命冒險

310
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,890
那么我就找其他人來做
Then I'll have to find someone else to do it.

311
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,760
- 該你上了高手 - 我已經瘋了
- You're up, slugger. - I'm crazy.

312
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,930
我已經瘋了

313
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:27,310
因感到寂寞而瘋
Crazy for feeling so lonely.

314
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,570
他們又讓他進去了
They're getting him back in again.

315
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:42,120
我們必須在他背叛我們之前阻止他
We should stop him before he betrays us.

316
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:45,910
日期調到6
Set the date for the six.

317
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,620
如果他狀態惡化 就拉他出來
If his condition deteriorates, pull him out.

318
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,580
- 你父親 - 我不管我爸說了什么
- You father... - I don't care what my father said.

319
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:57,420
我在世上到底做了什么?
What in the world did I do?

320
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,760
- 卡爾聽我說 - 我為嘗試瘋狂
- Cal, listen to me. - I'm crazy for trying...

321
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,640
聽我說 你必須緊盯著阿吉拉爾
Listen to me. You have to stay with Aguilar.

322
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,100
為哭泣瘋狂
Crazy for crying...

323
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,600
呆在同步空白處很危險
Staying in synch-void could be dangerous.

324
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:12,770
我為愛你而瘋狂
And I'm crazy for loving you...

325
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:52,900
很快他們將進軍格拉納德
Soon they will march on Granada.

326
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,480
蘇丹穆罕穆德已經虛弱了
Sultan Muhammad is weak.

327
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,070
他將交出伊甸蘋果
He'll surrender the Apple

328
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:06,240
并且為了救王子背叛信條
and betray the Creed to save the prince.

329
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:11,460
愛讓我們變弱
The love makes us weak.

330
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,720
值得高興的是我將犧牲我的血肉
Gladly I'll sacrifice my flesh and blood,

331
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,430
讓信條得以幸存
for survival of the Creed.

332
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:44,610
當我今天死去時 別為我浪費眼淚
When I die today, don't waste your tears for me.

333
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:34,620
主發話了
The Lord spoke.

334
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:38,460
他說:
And he said:

335
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:42,090
"如果一個人不遵從我
"If a man abide not in me

336
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,670
他就會被投入火中
he is cast into the fire

337
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:48,010
并且被燒死!"
and he is burned!"

338
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,930
數十年來
For decades,

339
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:58,900
你們因宗教不同
you have lived in the world torn apart

340
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:01,730
生活在四分五裂的世界
by religious discord.

341
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:06,070
但很快感謝上帝
But soon, thanks to God

342
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,530
和宗教法庭
and Inquisition

343
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:14,870
我們將清洗這一疾病!
we will purge this disease!

344
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:25,760
你們面前的這些罪人
The sinners before you,

345
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:30,180
在這場圣戰中致力于保護
sought to defend the heretic prince of Granada,

346
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,810
野蠻人最后的據點格拉納德
the last heathen stronghold

347
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:37,600
的異教徒的王子
in our holy war.

348
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:40,100
所以今天
So today,

349
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:44,230
在我們的國王及皇后面前
before our king and queen

350
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,440
我發誓我將在上帝的圣火中
I swear we shall wash ourselves clean,

351
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,860
凈化我們自己!
in the holy fire of God!

352
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:56,660
看啊
Behold...

353
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,960
上帝的意志!
God's will!

354
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,760
你將看著你們的導師被燒死 然后以最慢的方式死去
You will watch your mentor burn and then you will die the slowest.

355
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:25,230
給未來帶來榮耀
Give glory to the future.

356
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,570
而不是給我們
Not to us.

357
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,110
他正在同步
He is synchronizing.

358
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,330
該死的異教徒!
Damned heretics!

00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,140
別讓他們跑了!
Don't let them escape!

00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:18,940
跳
Jump.

361
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,750
同步消除完畢

362
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,210
放他下來!
Get him down!

363
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,170
叫醫生!
Call the medics!

364
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:52,430
沒事了沒事了 卡爾醒醒卡爾
Okay. It's okay. Cal, stay with me. Cal.

365

367
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,990
看著我
Look at me.

368
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,560
我的腿沒知覺了
I can't feel my legs.

369
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:38,140
癱瘓是暫時的
Paralysis is temporal.

370
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:42,770
壞消息呢?
What's the bad news?

371
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:46,070
它造成了神經分裂  但是我們帶你挺過來了
It caused a neurological split but we got you through it.

372
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,690
這一次
This time.

373
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,990
我會死在這兒對吧?
I'm gonna die in here, aren't I?

374
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,790
不會
No.

375
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,000
只要你自愿進入那里就不會死
Not if you go in there on your own free will.

376
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,340
我辦不到
I can't do this.

377
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:09,130
不你行的
Yes, you can.

378
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:13,050
那個伊甸蘋果你是僅存的能找到它的人
The Apple. You're the only one left who can find it.

379

我們能結束這些痛苦卡爾

為所有人
For everyone.

381
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:50,130
你從哪兒得到它的?
Where did you get this?

And brought it here for safekeeping.

384
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,640
保管?
Safekeeping?

385
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:00,180
你偷了它

386
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:03,440
這是你母親的項鏈 我希望你拿著它
It's your mother's necklace. I wanted you to have it.

387
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:06,560
他為什么在這?
Why was he there?

388
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,570
- 為了救她 - 從誰手里?

389
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:11,240
- 她自己的人 - 和你有什么關系?

390
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:15,530
刺客和圣殿騎士的戰爭 持續了幾個世紀了
Assassins and Templars have been at war for centuries.

391
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:18,240
我想改變它
I aim to change that.

392
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:20,290
哦對我忘了

我們在喂養野獸

407

放了我怎么樣?
How about you let me out of here?

408
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:20,700
這我辦不到
That's something I can't manage.

409
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:25,700
我是來做交易的

420
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,230
你對他們做了什么?
What have you done to them?

421
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:44,450
當你不是自愿回到過去時就會這樣
It's what happens if you don't enter in regression on your own volition.

422
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,460
你認出這個了嗎?
Do you recognize this?

423
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:56,290
這是刺客的袖劍
It's Assassin's blade.

424
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,470
這就是那把
This is the actual one...

425
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,640
你父親用來殺死你母親的刀
your father used to take your mother's life.

426
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:11,560
他也在這你知道嗎?
He's here, you know?

427
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:20,530
母親的死卡爾
Mother's death, Cal.

428
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:24,570
可不是什么應該讓孩子看到的東西
Not something a boy should ever be made to see.

429
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:16,040
這是錯的
This is wrong.

430
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:18,080
你逼我的
You left me no choice.

431
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:20,630
他必須以自己的意志進入你說的
He has to go in on his own free will, you said that.

432
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:24,090
- 我必須協商 - 你是說操控?
- I had to negotiate. - You mean manipulate?

433
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:29,850
我向長老保證我們會為倫敦獲得伊甸蘋果
I assured the Elders we would have the Apple for London.

434
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:35,640
在兩天內
That's in two days.

435
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:40,940
他不想知道他的過去 或他父親的
He doesn't want to know his past, or his father.

436
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,780
他想摧毀他們全部
He wants to destroy them, both.

437
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:47,740
我們不是來制造怪物的
We're not in the business of creating monsters.

438
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,620
我們既不會制造他們也不會毀滅他們
We neither created them nor destroyed them.

439
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:53,620
我們只不過任他們沉溺于 自己不可動搖的信仰
We merely abandoned them to their own inexorable faith.

440
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:12,430
- 你是你母親的兒子 - 什么意思?
- You're your mother's son. - What does that mean?

441
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:18,350
你體內流動的血不只是你自己的
Blood that flows through you is not your own.

442
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:21,310
還屬于信條
Belongs to the Creed.

443
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:23,980
你母親知道的
Your mother knew that.

444
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,110
她死了信條才得以存活
She died so the Creed may live.

445
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:32,030
告訴我為什么會這樣!
Remind me how, exactly!

446
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:37,410
你看到的確實是我做的
What you saw, I did.

447
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,630
你謀殺了她
You murdered her.

448
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:49,380
我寧可奪去她的生命也不想它讓機器偷取
I took her life rather than have it stolen by that machine.

449
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:55,100
使命讓人偉大
Man grows with the greatness of his task.

450
01:04:57,390 --> 01:04:59,100
我本應殺了你
I ought to have killed you.

451
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,650
我下不了手
I couldn't.

452
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:06,940
那么現在
Well, here.

453
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:09,900
殺了我
Take it.

454
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:12,240
做你30年前做不了的事
Do what you couldn't do 30 years ago.

455
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:14,320
刀在你手里卡爾
It's in your hands now, Cal.

456
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:17,410
這就是他們想要的
This is what they want.

457
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:20,000
讓我留血
Spill my blood.

458
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:23,880
但是別再回機器里了
But do not go back in the Animus.

459
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,500
為什么?
Why?

460
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:31,340
伊甸蘋果包含了自由意志的基因編碼
The Apple contains the genetic code for free will.

461
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:34,090
他們會用它毀了我們
They will use it to destroy us.

462
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:38,140
我要找到它
I'm gonna find it.

463
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:44,230
然后看著他們摧毀你和你的信條
And watch them destroy you and your Creed.

464
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,570
你毀不掉信條
You can not kill the Creed.

465
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,110
它在你的血液里
It's in your blood.

466
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,490
伊甸蘋果就是一切
The Apple is everything.

467
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:55,200
你母親為保護它而死
Your mother died to protect it.

468
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:00,540
她沒得選
She had no choice.

469
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:11,380
我有
I do.

470
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,470
你會毀了信條!
You're gonna kill the Creed!

471
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:09,360
帶我去Animus
Take me to the Animus.

472
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:19,530
把我放進去
Put me in.

473
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:21,660
準備好Animus
Prepare the Animus.

474
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:23,370
自愿回歸
Voluntary regression.

475
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:28,830
你知道刺客名字的由來嗎?
Do you know how the Assassins came to be named?

476
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:33,510
來自阿拉伯語 "Hashashin"
From an Arabic word "Hashashin".

477
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:36,130
他們是被社會排斥的人
They were society's outcasts.

478
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:39,970
那些冷血偷竊、謀殺的人
Those who stole, who murdered in cold blood.

479
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:46,140
人們嘲笑他們 叛逆者愚蠢的人癮君子
People ridiculed them... Rebels, fools, drug addicts.

480
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,310
但他們是智慧的
But they were wise.

481
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:53,190
他們利用這個名聲來向那些甚至最強的敵人
They used this reputation to hide the dedication to principles

482
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:56,150
隱藏自己所獻身原則的
beyond those of even their strongest enemies.

483
01:07:57,070 --> 01:08:01,580
我為此敬佩他們
And for that I admire them.

484
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:07,410
但你不是其中之一
But you're not one of those men.

485
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:10,580
那你是嗎?
Are you?

486
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:13,300
走著瞧吧
Let's find out.

487
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,850
啟動回歸
Commencing regression.

488
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:31,150
這是我一生的工作
This is my life's work.

489
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:34,980
這是我的生活
It's my life.

490
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,910
為了信條
For the Creed.

491
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:30,500
我們的生命
Our own lives...

492
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:34,040
我們所留下的才是重要的
What matters is what we leave behind.

493
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:52,980
蘇丹
Sultan...

494
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:55,610
交出伊甸蘋果
Surrender the Apple.

495
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:57,780
你的刺客保護者都沒了
Your Assassin protectors are gone.

496
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:01,740
信條完了
The Creed is finished.

497
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:44,570
我的孩子
My son.

498
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:25,320
這里埋藏著
Here lies the seed

499
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:28,200
人類第一次反抗的種子
of man's first disobedience,

500
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:32,200
自由意志的種子
of free will itself.

501
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,970
多虧了伊甸蘋果
Thanks to the Apple of Eden,

502
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,630
我們所知的世界
the known world

503
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:50,970
將被領入新時代
shall be ushered into a new age.

504
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:54,100
一個和平時代
One of peace,

505
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:58,350
所有戰爭中的人
in which all the warring populations of mankind

506
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:01,400
將完全只服從于
shall bow in perfect obedience

507
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:04,990
我們圣殿騎士的統治
to our one templar rule.

508
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,470
伊甸蘋果
The Apple.

509
01:13:13,510 --> 01:13:15,220
給他
Give it to him.

510
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:18,140
現在
Now.

511
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:22,650
為了信條
For the Creed.

512
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:25,770
上!
Go!

513
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:28,920
原諒我
Forgive me.

514
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:08,020
結束了!
It's over!

515
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,230
刺客!
Assassin!

516
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:45,930
信仰之躍
A leap of faith.

517
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:11,250
我們在哪兒?
Where are we?

518
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:14,460
看起來像軍港
It looks like a military port.

519
01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:29,300
卡的斯帕洛斯-德拉弗龍特拉
Kadiz, Palos de la Frontera.

520
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:08,930
刺客為它而死
The Assassins died for it.

521
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:12,100
用你的生命保護它
Protect it with your life.

522
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:15,600
我是信條的朋友
I am a friend of the Creed.

523
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:24,820
把它帶入你的墳墓
Take it to your grave.

524
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:27,740
我發誓
I swear.

525
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,550
這是什么? 翻譯
What is it? Translation.

526
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:58,020
循著陽光 我將拋下這舊世界
Following the light of the sun, I shall leave this old world behind.

527
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,150
是克里斯托弗·哥倫布
It's Christopher Columbus.

528
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:03,570
他被埋在哪兒?
Where is he buried?

529
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,690
他的遺體回到了西班牙
His remains were returned to Spain.

530
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,740
他的陵墓在塞維利亞大教堂
His tomb is in Seville Cathedral.

531
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:14,540
我們找到它了
We found it.

532
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,490
嘿全明星過來
Hey All Stars, come here.

533
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:58,410
挑一個
Pick one.

534
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:01,330
隨便哪個
Anyone.

535
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:12,010
- 公共休息室被突破 - 封鎖Animus
- Breach in common room. - Seal the Animus.

536
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,030
這是記憶么?
Is it a memory?

537
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:36,990
不是
No.

538
01:23:33,630 --> 01:23:35,340
來吧!
Come on!

539
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,770
- 轉運? - 準備就緒了
- Transport? - Standing by.

540
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:55,280
保護Animus 清理整個設施
Protect the Animus. Purge the facility.

541
01:23:56,820 --> 01:23:58,490
我要先帶你離開這兒
I need to get you out of here first.

542
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:08,000
- 不! - 我們必須離開索菲亞
- No! - We have to leave, Sophia.

543
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:52,750
不!
No!

544
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:55,300
不!
No!

545
01:25:07,230 --> 01:25:08,940
把它撿起來!
Pick it up!

546
01:25:22,070 --> 01:25:23,780
你不是孤軍奮戰卡爾
You are not alone, Cal.

547
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:27,250
你從來不是
You never were.

548
01:25:41,550 --> 01:25:43,260
- 打開 - 來吧
- Open... - Come on.

549
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:00,650
其他人盲目 追尋真理的時候
Where other men blindly follow the truth,

550
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:04,200
- 記住 - 萬事皆虛
- remember... - Nothing is true.

551
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:08,830
當其他人被 道德法律束縛時
Where other men are limited by morality or law,

552
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:14,000
- 記住 - 事事皆允
- remember... - Everything is permitted.

553
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:18,710
我們在黑暗中為光明服務
We work in the darkness to serve the light.

554
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:22,630
我們是刺客
We are Assassins.

555
01:26:51,830 --> 01:26:53,540
現在怎么辦 開拓者?
What now, pioneer?

556
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:00,090
我們打
We fight.

557
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:53,110
閣下
Your Excellency.

558
01:30:55,820 --> 01:30:57,700
榮耀屬于你父親
The glory will go to your father.

559
01:30:59,870 --> 01:31:01,580
但我們都知道是誰發現了它
But we both know who found it.

560
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:07,420
屬于你的時刻回來的孩子
Your time will come, my child.

561
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:50,420
圣殿騎士圣堂 倫敦
GREAT TEMPLAR LODGE, LONDON P s a g m e n o .com

562
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:08,150
他們會因此給你個諾貝爾和平獎
They'll give you a Nobel peace prize for this.

563
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:10,400
你最好開始寫演講稿

- 我讀了你的 - 然后呢?

如果我們消滅了自由意志 我們就消滅了刺客

一個威脅了世界幾個世紀的癌癥

你已經盡責了

我們的成果屬于長老

這是他們最美好的時光

576

你對我撒謊了

577

我一直知道

01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:21,350
在你心里你永遠首先是個科學家 然后才是圣殿騎士
that in your heart you're a scientist first, templar second.

579

你最近的成果令人刮目相看

580

一切都被你料到了

“現在我成了世界的

這好像不行

600
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,710
我所需做的就是大叫
All I have to do is shout.

601
