<i>而我有了人生中第一輛自行車</i>

00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:31,480

皮諾  你覺得這螞蟻知道自己要死了嗎
Pino, think this ant knows he's dead meat?

34
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:49,674
誰知道呢
Who knows?

35
00:02:49,892 --> 00:02:52,675
如果他跟你一樣  那肯定是什麼都不知道了
If he's like you, he doesn't know shit.

36

她來了
She's coming!

51
00:04:12,174 --> 00:04:13,523
怎麼了
What's going on?

52
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:18,611
想加入我們的話  就閉嘴看
If you wanna be one of us, just shut up and watch.

53
00:05:10,146 --> 00:05:13,016

瑪蓮娜  克斯特庫托村裏的第一美臀

59
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:40,517
太陽比月亮要大

60
00:06:44,476 --> 00:06:48,000
拉丁語念作  太陽比月亮要大
Or "Sol maior est quam lunam."

61
00:06:48,693 --> 00:06:51,043
我能搞你女兒嗎  你這個老聾子
Can I screw your daughter, you deaf old fart?

62
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,782
好吧  你快點
Yes, but hurry.

63
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:57,740
比起錢財我更愛誠實
I love honesty more than wealth.

64
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:03,006
"Magis diligo onestatem quam divitias."

65
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:07,636
Or "Magis diligo onestatem divitiis."

66
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,621
- 七個大拇指長  - 七個半
- Seven thumbs long! - Seven and a half thumbs!

67
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,839
- 我的簡直就是火箭筒  - 八個
- Mine's a bazooka! - I got eight!

68
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:48,883
八個也沒什麼的  只能給女人撓癢癢
Eight is nothing! That's just tickling a woman.

69
00:07:48,884 --> 00:07:52,536
一  二  三加二是五  加二得七  再加二得九
One, two... three and two is five, two is seven and two is nine.

70
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:54,102
魚雷
Torpedo!

71
00:07:54,277 --> 00:07:57,320
我的武器會把瑪蓮娜炸翻的
My submarine will rip Malena in half!

72
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:01,495
有一次我翹了課  路過瑪蓮娜的房子
Once I skipped school and went by Malena's house.

73
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:05,714
她在窗邊  喊我過去
She was at the window, and she called out to me.

74
00:08:05,888 --> 00:08:09,889
我以為她要讓我幫忙買煙
I thought she wanted me to get her some cigarettes.

75
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,890
我去拿錢  結果她的睡袍散了
I went up for the money, and her robe fell open.

76
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:17,500
就那樣  赤身裸體的站在那裏
And there she was... naked as the day she was born.

77
00:08:17,586 --> 00:08:19,500
我的天  她一定是故意誘惑我的
Holy shit! She did it on purpose to excite me.

78
00:08:19,674 --> 00:08:24,414
我太傻了  早知道有機會就上了
I was an idiot. I should have jumped at the chance.

79
00:08:24,415 --> 00:08:27,850
再給我一次機會  我肯定操翻她
If it happens again, I'll bang her brains out.

80
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:31,677
首先  她會戒煙的  她已經知道你沒色膽了
She'd quit smoking first. She knows you've got no balls.

81
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:35,939
你個小崽子  你都在這兩小時了
You little runt, you've been here for two hours...

82
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:37,984
還不量量自己的尺寸
and you still haven't measured yourself.

83
00:08:38,287 --> 00:08:40,288
快量
Measure it!

84
00:08:41,593 --> 00:08:43,203
一  二
One, two,

85
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,551
三  四  五
three, four, five...

86
00:08:46,681 --> 00:08:48,029
只數到六
Only six!

87
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,900
你知道怎麼形容穿短褲的小孩嗎
You know what they say about a kid in short pants?

88
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,857
褲子很短  雞巴更短
Short pants: Short dick!

89
00:08:55,205 --> 00:08:56,814
去你的  我的大拇指有你兩倍大
Fuck off. My thumbs are twice as big as yours!

90
00:08:56,815 --> 00:08:58,032
扯淡
Bullshit!

91
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,643
- 混蛋  你說誰的雞巴最大  哼  - 你的
- Who's got the biggest dick now, runt? - You do!

92
00:09:04,903 --> 00:09:06,861
我是元首  沒人比我更大
No, I am II Duce! Nobody's bigger than me!

93
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:15,732
- 喔  雷納多翹課了  - 噓
- Ooh. Renato's skipping school. - Shh!

94
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,053
你  過來  幫我買盒煙
You, come here! I need some cigarettes.

95
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:27,186
你想要什麼煙
What cigarettes do you want?

96
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,274
馬其頓  上品
Macedonia Extra.

97
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,889
我記得這條褲子很合身  是你爸的
I remember this suit very well. It's your father's.

98
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:56,977
是我二十年前做的  現在看起來還是嶄新的
I sewed it 20 years ago, and it still looks brand-new.

99
00:10:57,107 --> 00:11:01,021
他只在結婚的時候穿過  他想留著葬禮穿
He only wore it to his wedding. He wants to keep it for his funeral.

100
00:11:01,108 --> 00:11:05,588
如果他穿著這個下葬  那就直接進天堂了
If he's buried in this suit, he'll go straight to heaven!

101
00:11:05,674 --> 00:11:07,022
我爸還年輕
My father's still young.

102
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,414
而你也太年輕了  不能穿長褲
And you're too young for long pants.

103
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:12,720
我沒問你的意見  先生
I didn't ask for your opinion, sir.

104
00:11:12,937 --> 00:11:15,198
- 他知道嗎  - 他當然知道
- Does he know about this? - Of course he does!

105
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:18,852
你個小壞蛋  這是怎麼搞的
You little scoundrel, what the hell is this?

106
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:23,939
給我過來  你竟然還翹課
Come here, mister. So you want to skip school?

107
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,419
當然了  這個年紀誰不逃學
Fine. Who didn't at your age?

108
00:11:27,723 --> 00:11:29,420
- 別打他  - 我自有分寸
- Leave him alone! - I know what I'm doing.

109
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:35,552
你還讓你朋友打了一頓
And you let your friends beat you up.

110
00:11:35,682 --> 00:11:40,162
我當年像你這麼大的時候  只有我揍別人的份
Even though when I was your age, I'd beat my friends up!

111
00:11:40,597 --> 00:11:44,772
但你竟敢從你爸這裏偷褲子
But stealing trousers from your father...

112
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:49,165
還拿去改了自己穿  這就大錯特錯了
and getting them altered for yourself is just plain wrong.

113
00:11:49,295 --> 00:11:50,643
可是爸爸  你不明白
But, Papa, you don't understand!

114
00:11:51,034 --> 00:11:53,774
不明白  誰讓你說話了
Understand? Who said you could speak?

115
00:11:54,122 --> 00:11:56,297
我現在還穿短褲  很丟臉
I'm ashamed to wear short pants!

116
00:11:56,427 --> 00:11:58,515
燈籠褲呢  那基本算是長褲了
What about knickers? They're almost long pants!

117
00:11:58,645 --> 00:12:00,428
夠了  他還小啊
Enough! He's still a child!

118
00:12:00,558 --> 00:12:05,256
我要去告訴黨支部書記  你不讓我參加法西斯訓練
I'll tell our party secretary you won't let me go to the Fascist exercises!

119
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:13,040
我們定個約
Let's make a deal.

120
00:12:14,127 --> 00:12:18,432
哪天有人把咱偉大的領袖打爆頭
The day someone cracks the skull of "Our Great Leader,"

121
00:12:19,868 --> 00:12:22,477
你就能穿長褲了
then you'll get long pants.

122
00:12:22,695 --> 00:12:23,869
你發誓
Swear it.

123
00:15:00,476 --> 00:15:04,259
這麼年輕漂亮的女人獨身一人  真是罪過
A beautiful young woman all alone here. It's a crime.

124
00:15:05,477 --> 00:15:08,391
- 他說誰呢  - 瑪蓮娜·斯克迪亞  尼諾的性感老婆
- Who's he talking about? - Malena Scordia, Nino's sexy new wife.

125
00:15:08,477 --> 00:15:11,478
她枕邊一定有別人  肯定的
She must have somebody on the side... it's inevitable!

126
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:13,610
- 十五號  - 我
- Number fifteen! - Me.

127
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:17,306
尼諾從她鎮裏把她和她那耳朵不好使的爸爸一起接來
Right. Nino brings her from her village with her ailing father.

128
00:15:17,393 --> 00:15:21,437
結果一個月之後  砰  尼諾上戰場了
And then a month later... boom... Nino's called to the war.

129
00:15:21,525 --> 00:15:24,134
誰敢打賭她不跟別人睡
Who here wants to bet she's sleeping all alone?

130
00:15:24,264 --> 00:15:26,135
我才不打呢
Not me!

131
00:15:29,353 --> 00:15:31,396
為什麼我不能跟他們坐一起
Why don't you let me sit with the others?

132
00:15:31,484 --> 00:15:35,528
你還太小  不能坐大人的椅子
You're too young to sit in the adult chair.

But, son, if you don't know the title, how can I help you?

152
00:18:55,146 --> 00:18:57,364
就是曲調優美  非常浪漫
It's that pretty, romantic one...

153
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:04,191
但是愛不會  你怎麼不早說
Ma L'Amore No. Why didn't you say so?

154
00:19:07,715 --> 00:19:09,410
十塊錢  去收銀台付錢吧
Ten lire. Pay at the cashier's.

155
00:19:09,584 --> 00:19:10,932
- 你不試聽一下嗎  - 為什麼
- Don't you test it? - What for?

156
00:19:11,063 --> 00:19:14,107
- 也許壞了呢  - 這是全新的
- It might be defective. - It's brand-new!

157
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,972
<i>瑪蓮娜小姐  我這顆燃燒的心  為你寫了無數封信</i>
<i>Miss Malena, this heart of mine, on fire, has written so many letters,</i>

158
00:21:41,102 --> 00:21:45,408
<i>但我卻無法鼓起勇氣寄給你</i>
<i>and if I didn't have the courage to send them to you,</i>

159
00:21:45,582 --> 00:21:48,322
<i>只是因為不想傷害你</i>
<i>it was only because I didn't want to do you harm.</i>

160
00:21:49,018 --> 00:21:52,541
<i>如果我寄出了這一封  請見諒</i>
<i>So forgive me if I dare to send you this one.</i>

161
00:21:52,584 --> 00:21:55,715
<i>鎮上有很多流言蜚語</i>
<i>I want you to know that this town has many gossips...</i>

162
00:21:55,803 --> 00:22:00,498
<i>惡意中傷你  說你有個情夫</i>
<i>who say bad things about you... that you have a secret lover.</i>

163
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:03,978
<i>我知道這不是真的  你沒有任何人</i>
<i>I know it's not true. You don't have anyone.</i>

164
00:22:04,065 --> 00:22:08,023
<i>你丈夫走後  你心中唯一的男人  只有我</i>
<i>After your husband, the only man in your life is me.</i>

165
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,640
我得走了  明天學校見
I have to go. I'll see you at school tomorrow.

166
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,860
再見
So long!

167
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,860
別迷路了
Don't get lost!

168
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,640
律師大人  你把報紙拿反了
Mr. Lawyer! Your newspaper's upside down!

169
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,000
多管閒事
Mind your own fucking business!

170
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:36,627
早上好  瑪蓮娜夫人  你還好嗎  令尊可好
Good morning, Signora Malena. Are you well? How is your father?

171
00:25:08,462 --> 00:25:12,593
看夠了吧  演出結束  她走了
The show's over! She's gone now!

172
00:26:08,304 --> 00:26:09,608
我忘帶鑰匙了
I forgot the key.

173
00:26:25,874 --> 00:26:28,831
看來大家說的是真的了
So it's true what people say!

174
00:26:28,961 --> 00:26:31,092
你怎麼了  你看起來好奇怪
What's the matter with you? You look so strange.

175
00:26:31,267 --> 00:26:32,483
你用謊言困住了我
You've poisoned me with your lies.

176
00:26:32,614 --> 00:26:35,745
什麼謊言  我都沒跟你說過話
What lies? I've never spoken to you.

177
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:41,312
我早就知道  你是個放蕩的女人
I knew it from the start... you're a loose woman.

178
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:44,487
可是我沒做錯任何事啊
But I've never done anything wrong.

179
00:26:44,661 --> 00:26:47,618
騙子  我一直騎車跟蹤你
Liar! I've been following you on my bicycle!

180
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:50,010
- 我知道你去了哪兒  我什麼都知道  - 不
- I know where you went. I know everything! - No!

181
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,358
- 律師 還有牙醫  - 不  雷納多  我只愛你
- The lawyer, the dentist! - No, Renato, I love only you!

182
00:26:53,576 --> 00:26:55,011
騙子
Liar!

183
00:26:59,795 --> 00:27:01,666
- 阿莫羅索  - 到
- Amoroso. - Here!

184
00:27:01,796 --> 00:27:02,796
- 卡裏  - 到
- Cali. - Here!

185
00:27:03,449 --> 00:27:04,579
- 科斯坦薩  - 到
- Costanza. - Here!

186
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,624
教授  我能把雞巴塞到瑪蓮娜的奶子中間嗎
Professor, can I put my dick between Malena's tits?

187
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:11,059
我能塞進她嘴裏嗎
Can I put mine in her mouth?

188
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,190
我能塞到她大腿深處嗎
Can I put mine between her legs?

189
00:27:14,103 --> 00:27:15,974
好吧  但只能一個一個來
Okay, but one at a time!

190
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,520
你給鏈條上過油嗎
Do you spit instead of oiling it?

191
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:31,149
沒有  我上的食用油
No. I use cooking oil.

192
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:32,651
如果你來這兒  我會給你一些油
If you come, I will give it to you.

193
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,904
得用機械油  傻瓜  或是潤滑油  那更好
Used machine needs oil, fool. Or grease, which is better.

194
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,782
你知道潤滑油嗎  它能讓鏈條保持順溜
Do you know grease? Keep over the chain slippery!

195
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:52,592
她為什麼不嫁個她們鎮上的人
Why didn't she marry someone from her own village?

196
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:54,244
肯定是沒人要她
I'm sure no one wanted her.

197
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:02,159
聽說她是個裁縫
They say she's a seamstress.

198
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,334
但是她也太粗野了
But she's so vulgar.

199
00:28:13,597 --> 00:28:15,468
我兒子說她看起來好假
My son says she looks fake.

200
00:28:15,642 --> 00:28:17,468
我丈夫說  就算有三米長的桿子  他都不會碰她
My husband says he wouldn't touch her with a ten-foot pole.

201
00:28:17,555 --> 00:28:22,209
波塔男爵的情婦就好得多
The Baron Bonta's mistress is much nicer.

202
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,686
至少吉娜不遮遮掩掩的
At least Gina does everything in the open.

203
00:28:24,687 --> 00:28:28,471
男爵一周來睡她一次  然後就回巴勒莫(西西里首府)
The baron screws her once a week and then goes back to Palermo.

204
00:28:28,862 --> 00:28:32,428
瑪蓮娜裝得這麼清高  以為我們不知道她都幹了什麼
Malena acts so superior. Like we don't know what she's up to.

205
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,472
等著瞧吧  她會有報應的
Wait and see. She'll get hers.

206
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,791
軍隊總部發出聲明
The headquarters of the armed forces communicates...

207
00:29:27,921 --> 00:29:30,487
我們勇敢無敵的戰士們帶領著
Our brave and invincible Fighting men have delivered a powerful blow...

208
00:29:30,618 --> 00:29:34,619
盟軍殺人不見血的武器
to the faceless war machine unleashed by the Allies.

209
00:29:34,793 --> 00:29:38,968
為了確保戰場上
In order to ensure the continued strength and vitality...

210
00:29:39,142 --> 00:29:44,187
人力物力的供給
of our forces at the front,

211
00:29:44,361 --> 00:29:49,884
所有市民的工資  將再次被延遲發放
all payment of civic pensions... will again be postponed...

212
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,886
- 好了  - 謝謝
- It's ready. - Thank you.

213
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:15,957
你會變瞎的
You will go blind!

214
00:31:24,561 --> 00:31:25,561
瑪蓮娜
Malena.

215
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:27,909
右列  向前看
Right rank! Eyes front!

216
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:31,171
舉起手臂來  重複
Arms out, arms high, in quick succession!

217
00:31:31,345 --> 00:31:34,606
一  二  一  二
One, two! One, two!

218
00:31:34,824 --> 00:31:39,348
聽說了嗎  瑪蓮娜的丈夫死了
Have you heard? Malena's husband was killed.

219
00:31:39,478 --> 00:31:41,435
可以追瑪蓮娜了
Malena is available!

220
00:32:11,356 --> 00:32:13,748
克斯特庫托村的同胞們
Comrades of Castelcuto,

221
00:32:13,922 --> 00:32:16,399
今日我們聚集於此
we are gathered here today...

222
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,749
為這可歌可泣的噩耗
to share in the tragic but honorable mourning...

223
00:32:20,923 --> 00:32:23,272
表示沉重地哀悼
which has struck our town.

224
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,837
哀悼尼諾·斯克迪亞上尉
To express our deepest condolences...

225
00:32:26,838 --> 00:32:29,578
並致以我們最深沉的弔唁
for the loss of Lt. Nino Scordia...

226
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:34,579
他英雄般的死在  北非的戰場上
heroically killed in action... in Northern Africa...

227
00:32:35,797 --> 00:32:37,928
也對他的遺孀瑪蓮娜表示慰問
and to his bride Maddalena,

228
00:32:38,145 --> 00:32:42,493
可惜她太過傷心  無法出席
who, stricken with grief, unfortunately isn't here with us.

229
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:47,148
- 她已經開始勾搭別人了  - 找別人暖床
- She's already out looking! - She'll need a warm bed now!

230
00:32:47,452 --> 00:32:51,541
但我們的心和她在一起  因為西西里的女人
But she is with us in spirit, because Sicilian women...

231
00:32:51,932 --> 00:32:54,672
守得住艱辛  做得出犧牲
with their hardships, with their sacrifices,

232
00:32:54,845 --> 00:32:57,064
誓死與戰士們共前進
march shoulder to shoulder with Fighting men!

233
00:33:02,674 --> 00:33:06,761
在座的市民們為了保衛祖國所付出的一切不會被忘記
Of our fellow citizen in defense of his country was not a useless

234
00:33:07,023 --> 00:33:09,632
凱迪上尉好帥
Lt. Cadei is so handsome.

235
00:33:11,981 --> 00:33:14,111
誰釣到他就幸運了
A lucky girl will catch him!

236
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:17,634
帶領我們走向法西斯帝國的最終勝利
That will carry us to the final victory of the Fascist Empire!

237
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,898
勝利萬歲
For Victory!

238
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:29,941
元首萬歲
Long live II Duce!

239
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:58,400
從現在起  我會一直在你身邊
From now on I'll be at your side.

240
00:34:58,486 --> 00:35:01,183
直到永遠  我保證
Forever. I promise.

241
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:03,531
只要給我些時間讓我長大
Just give me time to grow up.

242
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:00,372
現在她要找情人了吧
Now she'll take a lover for sure.

243
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,503
一旦上了床  可就沒回頭路了
Once in the sack, there's no looking back!

244
00:36:03,591 --> 00:36:06,504
她肯定懂  她都二十七歲了
She knows that. She's 27 years old.

245
00:36:06,678 --> 00:36:08,636
她的技術一定很好
She knows her way around the block!

246
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,506
牙醫庫西馬諾都為她瘋狂了
Cusimano, the dentist, has gone crazy for her.

247
00:36:11,593 --> 00:36:13,724
有一天  她路過  他看得呆了
One day he was distracted as he walked by...

248
00:36:13,898 --> 00:36:17,855
結果拔錯了一顆好牙
and pulled a healthy tooth instead of the rotten one!

249
00:36:18,769 --> 00:36:22,074
不管那牙醫了  為什麼最近都沒見到她
Dentist or not, why haven't we seen her lately?

250
00:36:22,204 --> 00:36:25,336
她太忙了唄
Guess she's too busy!

251
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,423
聽說她跟卡塔尼亞的一個
They say she's fooling around with a shopkeeper in Catania...

252
00:36:31,424 --> 00:36:32,946
反動的老闆鬼混
with subversive tendencies.

253
00:36:33,033 --> 00:36:36,338
也有人說是牙醫庫西馬諾
Some say Cusimano, the dentist.

254
00:36:36,469 --> 00:36:40,862
- 有家室的人  太丟臉了  - 生下來就是個婊子
- A family man. It's disgraceful! - When you're a born whore...

255
00:36:40,992 --> 00:36:45,820
聽說牧師收到各種匿名信
I hear the priest has received anonymous letters...

256
00:36:45,993 --> 00:36:48,385
說她情人是誰是誰
saying her lover is this man, that man.

257
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:50,255
人民的聲音就是上帝的聲音
The voice of the people is the voice of God!

258
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,742
我沒法跟別人傾訴我的困擾
I can't talk to anyone about my personal problems.

259
00:37:26,743 --> 00:37:28,744
太私密了
They're too intimate.

260
00:37:28,787 --> 00:37:31,962
你看起來人很好  我就對你說吧
But you seem nice. I'd like to confide in you.

261
00:37:32,092 --> 00:37:33,919
每天我都來給你點一支蠟燭
Every day, I'll light a candle for you.

262
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:45,574
週日我也會來做彌撒
I'll even come to Mass on Sunday.

263
00:37:45,704 --> 00:37:49,880
但你必須保護鎮上的瑪蓮娜·斯克迪亞
But you must protect Malena Scordia from the town.

264
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:53,663
對  就是那個寡婦  至少先照應幾年  然後我就會保護她
Yes, the widow... at least for a few years. Then I'll take over.

265
00:38:45,894 --> 00:38:50,026
隨時為您效勞
I am always at your service.

266
00:38:50,243 --> 00:38:52,244
- 再次慰問  瑪蓮娜  - 節哀
- Renewed condolences, Malena. - Condolences.

267
00:39:01,638 --> 00:39:03,899
好一個美臀
What a piece of ass!

268
00:39:05,857 --> 00:39:06,900
混小子
Son of a bitch!

269
00:39:10,118 --> 00:39:11,206
小混蛋  給我回來
You little runt! Come back here!

270
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:34,255
- 你不能唱意大利語的歌曲嗎  - 你不能說德語嗎
- Can't you sing in Italian? - Can't you speak German?

271
00:42:04,381 --> 00:42:06,468
雷納多  很晚了
Renato, It's late.

272
00:42:06,643 --> 00:42:08,818
雷納多  起床
Renato, get up.

273
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:18,646
惡魔啊
Monster!

274
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,908
你是個戀物癖
You're a fetishist,

275
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,343
受虐狂  簡直是個變態
a sadomasochist, or even worse, a pervert!

276
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,301
- 那是什麼  - 法式的帽子  媽
- What is that? - It's just a French hat, Ma!

277
00:42:31,345 --> 00:42:32,389
恥辱啊
Shame on you!

278
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,860
- 我能留著嗎  - 你這個不要臉的
- Can I keep them? - You shameless girl.

279
00:42:38,912 --> 00:42:43,174
你看什麼看  走開
What are you looking at? Get out of here!

280
00:42:43,304 --> 00:42:45,001
給我過來  混蛋
Come here, you little pig!

281
00:42:46,435 --> 00:42:48,350
- 你個變態  - 我做什麼了
- Goddamn pervert! - What did I do?

282
00:42:50,263 --> 00:42:54,873
以後不許跟我們坐一桌吃飯  聽見了嗎
You're not permitted to sit at the table with us, understand?

283
00:42:55,352 --> 00:42:57,569
- 回答我  - 好吧
- Answer me! - Okay!

284
00:43:00,918 --> 00:43:04,702
以後不許再跟你妹妹說話  聽見了嗎
You no longer have the right to speak to your sisters, understand?

285
00:43:04,788 --> 00:43:08,398
把我鎖起來啊  你有本事來啊
Lock me up! I'll show you!

286
00:43:09,311 --> 00:43:12,529
我沒改變主意前  你不准出屋子
You're not to leave this room until further notice!

287
00:43:13,269 --> 00:43:17,357
兒子  好歹也喝點湯啊  對你有好處
Son, at least have some soup. It will do you good.

288
00:43:17,748 --> 00:43:20,532
皮耶羅  他三天沒吃飯了
Pietro, he hasn't eaten for three days.

289
00:43:20,662 --> 00:43:24,446
蘇聯人民從來不吃飯
In the Soviet Union, they never eat.

290
00:43:25,533 --> 00:43:26,664
我說  這是什麼玩意
Still... What is this shit?

291
00:43:26,795 --> 00:43:30,926
法西斯給的  至少看起來像咖啡
The Fascists gave it to us. At least it looks like coffee.

292
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,883
是啊  我看起來還像大導演維托裏奧·德·西卡呢
Sure, and I look like Vittorio De Sica.

293
00:43:33,057 --> 00:43:35,883
他們給的東西都不好
Everything they give us is terrible!

294
00:43:35,884 --> 00:43:39,059
看這些口袋  總是漏
Look at these pockets. They're always ripping open!

295
00:43:39,232 --> 00:43:41,624
這些便宜的線根本就封不住口
This cheap thread doesn't hold the stitches!

296
00:43:41,754 --> 00:43:43,669
不是線的問題
The thread isn't the problem!

297
00:43:43,711 --> 00:43:46,973
我們的兒子背詩的時候  手也沒閒著
While our son recites poetry, his hands go to work in his pockets!

298
00:43:47,017 --> 00:43:49,931
什麼意思
What does that mean?

299
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:52,628
現在明白了嗎
Do you get it now?

300
00:43:53,105 --> 00:43:55,759
別補了  直接給封上吧
Just as well! Don't fix them. Sew the pockets closed!

301
00:43:55,932 --> 00:43:58,845
那他就沒口袋了
But he'll have no pockets.

302
00:43:58,846 --> 00:44:01,455
他會找到別的法子的  這是為了他好
He'll work it out. It will be good for his health!

303
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:05,848
關燈
Lights out!

304
00:44:06,327 --> 00:44:11,502
疲憊的靈魂再也無法停泊在安逸的港灣
That the weary spirit may never repose in more restful harbor...

305
00:44:11,676 --> 00:44:14,763
- 他發瘋了嗎  - 我看他是擼瞎了
- Has he gone crazy? - I think he's gone blind.

306
00:44:20,852 --> 00:44:23,780
在女人前  你不安地坐著
While upon womens work you sat intent,

307
00:44:23,896 --> 00:44:27,000
腦海中滿是迷茫的未來
content with the vague future you held in mind...

308
00:44:27,114 --> 00:44:31,600
那五月的香氣  供你度過每一天
was the scented May, and thus you used to spend your days.

309
00:44:31,898 --> 00:44:34,420
他需要透透氣
This child needs air.

310
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,638
- 透氣  - 對
- Air? - Air.

311
00:45:05,733 --> 00:45:07,169
早上好  教授
Good morning, Professor.

312
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,347
這封信是給你的
This letter is for you.

313
00:45:23,608 --> 00:45:25,869
說是急件
It says "urgent."

314
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:40,000
你丟盡了臉  你女兒瑪蓮娜把鎮上的男人睡了個遍
You're dishonored. Your daughter Malena is sleeping with the whole town.

315
00:45:59,531 --> 00:46:01,574
是個匿名信  不過我看到了
It was an anonymous letter, but I read it!

316
00:46:01,661 --> 00:46:04,357
說瑪蓮娜把鎮上的男人睡遍了
It says Malena is a whore with everyone in town!

317
00:46:04,531 --> 00:46:06,793
那我們也有戲了
So there's hope for us too!

318
00:46:08,794 --> 00:46:10,446
你收回那句話
Take it back!

319
00:46:10,533 --> 00:46:14,143
信不信我打死你  短褲小子
I'll bust your ass, Mr. Short Pants!

320
00:46:56,024 --> 00:46:57,589
今晚真美好
Tonight was wonderful.

321
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:03,069
- 我也覺得  - 我知道只過了十個月
- For me too. - I know it's been only ten months since.

322
00:47:03,242 --> 00:47:07,026
- 但我能再見到你嗎  - 好吧  你贏了
- But maybe I can see you again. - All right. You win.

323
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:10,462
- 明天吧  - 好  只要我不用值班
- Tomorrow. - Okay, as long as I'm not on duty.

324
00:47:10,636 --> 00:47:12,201
- 謝謝你的花  - 不客氣
- Thanks for the flowers. - You're welcome.

325
00:47:25,118 --> 00:47:26,858
自己多保重
Take care of yourself.

326
00:47:34,208 --> 00:47:37,642
那明天見
So see you tomorrow?

327
00:47:37,643 --> 00:47:38,774
好
Yes.

328
00:47:40,426 --> 00:47:42,514
- 再見  - 晚安  利昂
- Until then. - Good night, Leone.

329
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,907
明天幾點
What time?

330
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:51,777
- 晚上好  先生  - 晚上好個頭
- Good evening, sir. - Good evening, my ass!

331
00:47:51,908 --> 00:47:56,169
你怎麼敢纏著我未婚妻
How dare you pester my fiancee!

332
00:47:56,301 --> 00:47:59,432
一定是誤會  我是被邀請的
There must be a misunderstanding. I was invited.

333
00:47:59,562 --> 00:48:01,606
你這個騙子  混蛋
You're a liar and a bastard!

334
00:48:02,259 --> 00:48:05,128
我穿著制服  不能反擊  先生
Because I'm in uniform, I can not retaliate, sir.

335
00:48:05,259 --> 00:48:08,391
- 但你最好乖乖的  - 去你的
- But you will answer to me. - Anytime.

336
00:48:09,782 --> 00:48:14,609
- 懦夫  無賴  - 給我起來
- Coward, scoundrel! - Get up.

337
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,783
過來啊  看我不把你撕成兩半
Come here! I'll tear you apart, you coward!

338
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:20,045
撕成兩半
I'll break you in two!

339
00:48:21,351 --> 00:48:24,351
放我走  要不我就不客氣了
Let me go! Or I'll have to get tough with you!

340
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:30,831
- 姦夫在這裏  - 老婆
- Here's the adulterer! - My wife!

341
00:48:30,917 --> 00:48:34,180
- 長官  你看  他出軌了  - 跟一個男人
- Officer, look! He's cheating on me! - With a man?

342
00:48:34,397 --> 00:48:37,572
跟一個叛徒
With a traitor!

343
00:48:37,616 --> 00:48:40,225
你說就算有三米長的桿子也不碰她的
You said you wouldn't touch her with a ten-foot pole!

344
00:48:40,399 --> 00:48:41,355
是牙醫
It's the dentist.

345
00:48:44,443 --> 00:48:47,052
混蛋  我監視你很久了
I've been spying on you a long time, you bastard!

346
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:49,444
至於你
And as for you,

347
00:48:49,575 --> 00:48:53,010
滾回你的鎮上去搶別人老公吧  婊子
go steal husbands from your own village, you whore!

348
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,884
我們知道她有情人  不過竟然有兩個
We knew she had one lover, but two?

349
00:49:07,058 --> 00:49:10,059
牙醫是怎麼擠進去的
But where does the dentist fit in?

350
00:49:10,145 --> 00:49:11,537
擠進她的腿咯
He fits in between her legs!

351
00:49:11,625 --> 00:49:15,626
太丟臉了  她爸都辭掉了老師的工作
Her father was forced to quit the school in disgrace.

352
00:49:15,756 --> 00:49:18,627
他再也不想見他女兒瑪蓮娜了
He never wants to see his daughter Malena again.

353
00:49:18,757 --> 00:49:21,975
牙醫的老婆也把他踢出了家門
And the dentist's wife kicked him out of his house.

354
00:49:22,062 --> 00:49:27,627
妻子一怒之下肯定會把他告上法庭
That dragon of a wife will drag him into court!

355
00:49:27,628 --> 00:49:30,934
牙醫又有什麼錯呢  可憐的傢伙
What's the dentist got to do with it, poor guy?

356
00:49:31,064 --> 00:49:34,283
是瑪蓮娜那個婊子  她才該被抓起來
Malena's the whore! She should be taken to court!

357
00:49:34,456 --> 00:49:37,283
凱迪上尉看起來那麼正派
That Lt. Cadei seemed like such a gentleman.

358
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:39,632
怎麼摻合進來的
How could he get mixed up in this?

359
00:49:39,762 --> 00:49:43,154
大家都知道她就是個小三
Everyone knows she's a home wrecker.

360
00:49:43,285 --> 00:49:45,460
上尉自找的
The lieutenant was asking for it!

361
00:49:45,546 --> 00:49:48,677
- 她都不是這兒的人  忘記了自己的地位  - 他們會上法庭嗎
- She's not from here. She forgets where she is. - Will they go to court?

362
00:49:48,808 --> 00:49:54,765
當然了  她也許會坐牢的  他可是有婦之夫
Of course, she could go to jail. He's a married man!

363
00:49:54,766 --> 00:49:59,333
牙醫頭上要縫三針呢
The dentist needed three stitches in his head.

364
00:49:59,506 --> 00:50:02,899
但是牙醫先罵的上尉啊
But the dentist swore at the soldier first.

365
00:50:02,986 --> 00:50:05,029
冒犯了長官
That's insulting an officer.

366
00:50:05,291 --> 00:50:07,421
法庭會帶給我們答案的
We'll all end up in court!

367
00:50:07,813 --> 00:50:10,509
當我們還在遠處看著她的時候
While we were watching her caboose,

368
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:13,858
中尉和牙醫已經跟她搞上了
the lieutenant and the dentist were riding the train!

369
00:51:25,225 --> 00:51:27,008
她還去過律師跟公證人那兒
She's either going to the lawyer's or the notary's.

370
00:51:27,138 --> 00:51:30,009
沒錯  但那兩個男人那麼老  她能幹嘛
Sure, but what will she do with two old men like them?

371
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,966
- 不好意思  - 請進
- Excuse me. - Come in.

372
00:51:35,663 --> 00:51:36,923
需要幫助嗎
Can I help you?

373
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:39,707
我能和山托比律師談談嗎
May I speak to Lawyer Centorbi?

374
00:51:40,185 --> 00:51:41,621
請坐
Please have a seat.

375
00:51:44,664 --> 00:51:46,970
先生  寡婦斯克迪亞來了
Sir, it's the widow Scordia!

376
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:51,014
真的嗎  聖母啊
Can it be true? Beautiful Madonna!

377
00:52:02,191 --> 00:52:03,539
讓她進來
Have her come in.

378
00:52:04,191 --> 00:52:05,627
- 進去吧  - 謝謝
- Go in. - Thank you.

379
00:52:06,627 --> 00:52:08,628
請坐
Please sit down.

380
00:52:09,019 --> 00:52:10,584
真令人著迷
Charmed.

381
00:52:16,021 --> 00:52:19,846
我們繼續聽瑪蓮娜·波西格諾的證詞
We now continue with the testimony of Maddalena Bonsignore,

382
00:52:19,847 --> 00:52:23,153
寡婦斯克迪亞  又名瑪蓮娜
the widow Scordia called Malena.

383
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:26,589
她有可能會坐兩年牢
She could get two years in prison.

384
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:31,024
一切都會沒事的  相信我
Everything will be fine, trust me.

385
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:39,288
坐下
Sit down.

386
00:52:47,638 --> 00:52:51,552
你被指控和牙醫加西帕·庫西馬諾
You're accused of involving Dr. Gaspare Cusimano...

387
00:52:51,682 --> 00:52:55,466
保持地下戀人關係
in a secret and amorous relationship...

388
00:52:55,553 --> 00:52:57,771
以達到破壞其家庭的目的
aimed at the breaking up of his family.

389
00:52:57,945 --> 00:53:00,815
你認識牙醫庫西馬諾嗎
Do you know Dr. Cusimano?

390
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:02,989
是的
Yes.

391
00:53:03,164 --> 00:53:07,991
你現在  或者之前  做過他的未婚妻嗎
Are you or have you ever... been his fiancee?

392
00:53:08,295 --> 00:53:10,556
絕對不可能
Absolutely not.

393
00:53:10,731 --> 00:53:13,210
我怎麼會跟有家室的男人訂婚呢
How could I be engaged to a married man?

394
00:53:13,297 --> 00:53:17,037
為什麼庫西馬諾在那麼晚的時候
Why was Cusimano, at that unusual hour...

395
00:53:17,123 --> 00:53:19,168
要去你家裏呢
on his way to your house?

396
00:53:19,255 --> 00:53:20,385
我不知道
I don't know.

397
00:53:20,603 --> 00:53:24,691
你們以前發生過夜晚共處的情況嗎
Had he been in your company on previous evenings?

398
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:42,566
是的  一次
Yes, once.

399
00:53:47,871 --> 00:53:50,219
- 哪裏  - 在我家
- Where? - At my house.

400
00:53:57,439 --> 00:54:00,091
他跳進來  看起來很蠢  但是
Jumped right in, the dentist did. He looks stupid, but...

401
00:54:00,266 --> 00:54:05,745
- 他待了多久  - 不久
- How long did he stay? - Not long.

402
00:54:05,919 --> 00:54:06,919
你們做了什麼
What did you do?

403
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,486
他給我帶了我父親的藥
He brought me some medicine for my father.

404
00:54:13,616 --> 00:54:17,400
如果是你父親的藥  他為什麼要帶給你
If it was for your father, why did he bring it to you?

405
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:18,835
我不知道
I don't know.

406
00:54:20,183 --> 00:54:24,098
他給你藥之後呢  你們又做了什麼
What did you do after he gave you the medicine?

407
00:54:24,228 --> 00:54:26,403
他說了聲再見就走了
He said good-bye and left.

408
00:54:30,752 --> 00:54:34,753
那為什麼庫西馬諾  這位曾經
Then why has Cusimano, are put able professional,

409
00:54:34,927 --> 00:54:36,752
在五年前
who, five years ago...

410
00:54:36,753 --> 00:54:40,798
給領袖拔過牙的資深牙科專家
had the honor of extracting one of II Duce's teeth...

411
00:54:40,928 --> 00:54:43,103
在公眾場合聲稱他是你的未婚夫
publicly declare that he is your fiance?

412
00:54:43,277 --> 00:54:47,669
他胡扯的  我跟這一點關係都沒有
He made that up. I had nothing to do with it.

413
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:49,583
你丈夫真膽大
Your husband's crazy.

414
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:54,627
你和凱迪中尉是什麼關係
What kind of relationship did you have with Lt. Cadei?

415
00:54:57,455 --> 00:55:02,717
我是個寡婦  我和凱迪中尉的關係
I'm a widow. My business and that of Lt. Cadei...

416
00:55:02,847 --> 00:55:05,022
跟法律無關
are no concern of the law.

417
00:55:07,022 --> 00:55:10,719
好吧  你知道嗎
All right. Did you know that,

418
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:14,763
因為這些事情  凱迪中尉被發配到阿爾巴尼亞了
as a result of these affairs, Lt. Cadei was transferred to Albania?

419
00:55:14,851 --> 00:55:15,502
幹掉了一個
One down.

420
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,417
在他離開之前  也接受了法庭的訊問
And before his departure, he was questioned in judicial inquiry.

421
00:55:19,895 --> 00:55:20,678
讀給她聽
Clerk.

422
00:55:20,852 --> 00:55:23,287
他聲稱他以前只在寡婦斯克迪亞家
He declared to have encountered

423
00:55:23,417 --> 00:55:27,810
見過她兩次
the widow Scordia only twice... in her home,

424
00:55:27,897 --> 00:55:32,290
並且沒有發生非正當關係
and to have had no amorous relationship...

425
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:36,813
他認為他們的關係  僅僅是普通朋友
considering their relationship "just a casual friendship."

426
00:55:40,596 --> 00:55:41,814
賤人
Son of a bitch.

427
00:55:41,944 --> 00:55:45,989
凱迪中尉收到了我的委託人的信件
Lt. Cadei was received by my client...

428
00:55:46,119 --> 00:55:50,686
她毫不隱瞞她對中尉的
and she makes no secret about having had for him...

429
00:55:50,859 --> 00:55:53,382
特殊感覺
certain feelings.

430
00:55:53,469 --> 00:55:56,992
但不像已婚的庫西馬諾
But unlike the married Cusimano,

431
00:55:57,384 --> 00:56:02,124
看看他吧  我就直說了
who was, let's face it, guilty...

432
00:56:02,341 --> 00:56:04,994
看看這張因為縱慾過度而導致早衰
of a pre-senile dimming of the senses...

433
00:56:05,734 --> 00:56:08,038
且寫滿罪惡的臉
of an intoxicating kaleidoscope of desires...

434
00:56:08,082 --> 00:56:13,649
不像有家室的庫西馬諾
Unlike the family man Cusimano, But...

435
00:56:13,735 --> 00:56:15,867
凱迪現在是
Cadei is...

436
00:56:16,084 --> 00:56:20,085
以前也是
and was...

437
00:56:20,346 --> 00:56:21,564
單身漢  一個單身漢
a bachelor... a bachelor!

438
00:56:21,737 --> 00:56:23,738
聰明啊  那個律師
Clever, that lawyer.

439
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:25,782
他本身就是單身漢
He's a bachelor himself.

440
00:56:26,347 --> 00:56:31,131
仔細調查就會發現事實真相  因此
Careful investigation of the facts tell us, therefore...

441
00:56:31,393 --> 00:56:34,567
斯克迪亞沒有罪過
that the Scordia woman committed no other crime...

442
00:56:34,697 --> 00:56:37,307
只有悲慘的命運
than that of being ill-fated,

443
00:56:37,568 --> 00:56:41,221
孤獨又美麗
alone and beautiful.

444
00:56:41,568 --> 00:56:44,900
她唯一的罪過便是  她的美麗
Here is her crime: Her beauty!

445
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,800
正因為如此  嫉妒
And from here, the envy,

446
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,000
謊言  恥辱
the lies, the disgrace,

447
00:56:48,093 --> 00:56:51,223
使她一無所有  甚至剝奪了她父親的信任
that have deprived her even of a father's trust!

448
00:56:51,224 --> 00:56:55,877
可是  她仍處在無聲的痛苦裏
And yet, she herself is still in silent agony...

449
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:59,747
向那遠在東非的戰死沙場之人的
mourning over that unmarked war grave...

450
00:57:00,704 --> 00:57:06,097
無名墓冢哀悼
in faraway East Africa.

451
00:57:07,141 --> 00:57:10,489
我們辯論的中心內容
In the beating heart of our argument...

452
00:57:10,663 --> 00:57:15,273
是一個如此大膽卻又合情合理的觀點
is an audacious, but nonetheless valid, thesis...

453
00:57:15,577 --> 00:57:17,490
我想請問
which asks just one question:

454
00:57:17,491 --> 00:57:19,666
一個這樣的少婦
Can a young woman...

455
00:57:19,753 --> 00:57:24,623
在愛的國度裏寡居了這麼久之後
after the odyssey of a widowhood endured for the love of country...

456
00:57:24,624 --> 00:57:29,886
在新生活中尋求庇護有錯嗎
hope for protection in the shelter of a new life?

457
00:57:30,016 --> 00:57:33,365
她難道沒有權利去追求  去譜寫
Does she have the right to yearn for, and to write...

458
00:57:33,539 --> 00:57:36,627
一個屬於她的  全新的愛情故事嗎
a new ending to her own love story?

459
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,411
法官大人
Your Honor,

460
00:57:39,584 --> 00:57:41,802
卡斯特庫托的居民們都回答  是的
the citizens of Castelcuto reply: "Yes!"

461
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,502
庫西馬諾不會再來煩我了吧
Will Cusimano leave me alone now?

462
00:57:55,675 --> 00:58:00,416
當然不會  他被送進精神病院了
Of course. He's been put into a psychiatric clinic.

463
00:58:00,633 --> 00:58:03,634
他要志願參加東非作戰
He wants to volunteer for the Forces in East Africa.

464
00:58:04,287 --> 00:58:08,592
他還沒意識到我們幾年前就失去非洲了
He doesn't realize we lost Africa ages ago!

465
00:58:08,679 --> 00:58:12,637
讓我們忘了庫西馬諾和凱迪中尉吧
But let's forget Cusimano and the fickle Lt. Cadei.

466
00:58:12,941 --> 00:58:15,029
這兒只有我們
Let's get to us!

467
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:21,117
我知道這不多
I know it's not much.

468
00:58:21,204 --> 00:58:24,857
但我只有這麼多了  他們剋扣了我的撫恤金
But it's all I have. They've cut my pension.

469
00:58:25,248 --> 00:58:27,292
你不明白嗎
Don't you understand?

470
00:58:27,466 --> 00:58:30,076
錢是小事
That's peanuts!

471
00:58:30,685 --> 00:58:32,947
我的律師費遠不止這些
My fee is much more than that.

472
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:36,904
你永遠都付不起的
You'll never have enough money!

473
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:40,035
那我怎麼償還你
But how will I ever repay you?

474
00:58:40,121 --> 00:58:43,036
很簡單  我的甜心
It's very easy, my sweet.

475
00:58:43,122 --> 00:58:47,471
- 你說什麼  - 和我在一起  親愛的
- What are you saying? - Be with me, my love!

476
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:49,385
我好愛你啊
I'm in love with you!

477
00:58:54,691 --> 00:58:56,735
在這艱難的年頭  一個女人不應該單身獨處
A woman shouldn't be alone during these hard times.

478
00:58:57,518 --> 00:59:00,127
我有的是錢  你找不到更好的人了
I am a wealthy man. You won't find better.

479
00:59:02,823 --> 00:59:05,085
我可以照顧你父親  你再也不用擔心了
I'll take care of your father. You'll never have to worry again.

480
00:59:29,352 --> 00:59:33,831
我原諒她  她是為了付律師費
I forgive her. She did it to pay her lawyer's fees

481
00:59:33,919 --> 00:59:35,528
但只此一次  下不為例
only once and never again.

482
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:37,832
但你沒有遵守我們的契約
But you didn't keep our agreement.

483
00:59:39,789 --> 00:59:41,530
現在我們兩不相欠
Now we're even.

484
01:01:52,477 --> 01:01:55,434
<i>瑪蓮娜夫人  一個比我更有能力的人</i>
<i>Signora Malena, a more capable person than me...</i>

485
01:01:55,609 --> 01:01:59,392
<i>寫過這樣一句話  真愛是不求回報的</i>
<i>wrote that the only truelove is unrequited love.</i>

486

<i>It's been so long since you last came out of your house.</i>

<i>But the longer we are apart, the stronger my love becomes.</i>

<i>They say you're about to marry Centorbi, the lawyer.</i>

<i>市場上的婆娘不賣食物給你</i>
<i>how the women in the market won't sell you any good food...</i>

<i>and no man would hire you for fear of his wife.</i>

<i>But how will you manage to live with a fat, old man...</i>

494
01:02:25,746 --> 01:02:28,835
<i>他醜到沒有一個姑娘願意和他在一起</i>
<i>so ugly that no girl ever wanted him?</i>

<i>他們說他從來不洗澡  渾身散發惡臭</i>
<i>They say he never washes and stinks like a goat.</i>

496

你們真的要結婚了嗎
Is it true you're getting married?

500
01:03:12,368 --> 01:03:14,760
你在寫什麼
What are you writing?

501
01:03:14,846 --> 01:03:17,891
給我  給我看看
Give me that! Let me see!

502
01:03:18,456 --> 01:03:20,021
滾出去
Get out!

503
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:44,941
站直了
Stand up straight.

504
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:47,116
有點長啊  普拉西多先生
A little longer, Don Placido.

505

Will they be ready tomorrow?

507
01:03:52,552 --> 01:03:56,336
儘管我生意沒戰前好了  但也還是要時間的
The war has ruined my business, but it still takes time.

508
01:03:56,553 --> 01:03:58,728
同盟國繼續轟炸
As Allied bombings continue.

509

等我一下
Wait for me.

510
01:04:10,035 --> 01:04:12,992
天啊  求你幫幫我母親  求你了
Lord, help me with my mother, I beg you.

511

傻瓜  蠢貨
Moron! Idiot!

512
01:04:21,604 --> 01:04:22,734
笨蛋
Idiot!

你不能再把我當小孩了  我長大了
You can't treat me like a child. I'm a grown man!

絕不
Never!

518
01:05:02,222 --> 01:05:04,136
律師算是擱一邊了
The lawyer was left high and dry!

519
01:05:04,223 --> 01:05:07,702
他媽媽每週六還給他洗澡
His mother still bathes him every Saturday!

520
01:05:08,224 --> 01:05:11,137
總是有人阻礙瑪蓮娜的工作
Malena always has someone throwing a wrench in the works!

521
01:05:11,269 --> 01:05:14,921
找個男人取代律師又不難
It won't be hard finding someone to replace the lawyer!

522
01:05:15,226 --> 01:05:20,663

I'm sure we can find a way to make you some money.

530
01:08:16,099 --> 01:08:18,622

Hurry, there's someone else over here!

531

It's Professor Bonsignore.

532
01:08:43,585 --> 01:08:45,629
瑪蓮娜的爸爸
Malena's father.

533
01:09:51,429 --> 01:09:53,126
我是為你才來這兒
I'm here for you.

534
01:09:56,126 --> 01:09:57,822
請節哀  斯克迪亞夫人
Condolences, Signora Scordia.

535
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:02,084
請節哀

536
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:08,737
讓開  小屁孩
Step aside, kid.

537
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:11,434
夫人  我們能些什麼呢  聽天由命吧
Signora, what can we do? We're in the Lord's hands.

538
01:10:11,435 --> 01:10:12,478
考慮一下我的建議
Don't forget my offer.

我給你帶了些吃的
I brought you some more food.

542
01:13:07,306 --> 01:13:08,524
進來吧
Come in.

543
01:13:23,137 --> 01:13:25,486
- 你的秀髮美極了  - 你喜歡嗎
- Your hair looks terrific. - Do you like it?

544
01:13:25,616 --> 01:13:29,487

只要你帶食物過來
As long as you bring the food.

547
01:14:21,761 --> 01:14:25,545
在我們的歷史上從來沒有想過聯合在一起
Never before in our history have we been called upon to band together.

548
01:14:25,632 --> 01:14:28,546
幾年前元首還保證
Just a few years ago, II Duce promised

549
01:14:28,676 --> 01:14:32,285
納粹絕對不會侵佔西西里
that the Nazis would never occupy Sicily.

550
01:14:32,286 --> 01:14:34,156
你現在看  德國人到處都是
Look! The Germans are everywhere!

551
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:37,331
看那是誰
Look who's here.

552
01:15:00,075 --> 01:15:01,511
她現在染了紅髮
She's a redhead now.

553
01:15:02,293 --> 01:15:04,381
看她那騷樣
Look how she's put together.

554
01:15:04,555 --> 01:15:06,816
真想把那頭髮剪了
I'd like to cut off that hair.

555
01:15:18,689 --> 01:15:20,167
真噁心
How disgusting!

556
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:14,677
她現在竟然跟德國人搞了
Now she's even screwing the Germans.

557

- 那是誰  - 瑪蓮娜·斯克迪亞  婊子
- Who's that? - Malena Scordia, the slut.

558
01:17:18,764 --> 01:17:21,983
她跟另一個妓女吉娜聯手了
She's teamed up with that other whore, Gina.

559
01:17:22,156 --> 01:17:24,896
和德國人嗎
But with the Germans?

560
01:17:25,114 --> 01:17:28,506
看來她們在邁得諾酒店裏做健身運動啊
Seems there are gymnastics at the Moderno Hotel.

561
01:17:29,071 --> 01:17:31,811
兩個妓女從一間房跑到另一間房
The two whores run from room to room...

562
01:17:32,333 --> 01:17:35,682
一次接一打德國軍官
servicing a dozen officers at a time.

563
01:17:35,856 --> 01:17:37,639
爛貨
Holy shit!

564
01:18:09,082 --> 01:18:12,300
大姐  這個小孩被魔鬼附身了
My good woman, this child is possessed by the devil!

565
01:18:13,518 --> 01:18:14,648
耶穌  瑪利  約瑟保佑
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

566
01:18:23,911 --> 01:18:24,651
羅莎
Rosa!

567
01:18:28,086 --> 01:18:29,565
走吧
Come here!

568
01:18:31,087 --> 01:18:32,784
夠了
That's enough!

569
01:18:33,132 --> 01:18:36,089
你看起來就像米開朗基羅畫的聖母憐子圖
It looks like you're posing for Michelangelo's Pieta of the poor!

570
01:18:36,698 --> 01:18:37,437
不
No.

571
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:41,308
吾以耶穌基督之御名告知汝   不管汝欲藏於此身之何處  其形終現
Evil eye on blood is fed. Hold on fast till death is past.

572
01:18:41,482 --> 01:18:44,744
當盡早脫離此身為宜  逃往他處
Exorcise the devil from this child.

573
01:18:44,918 --> 01:18:46,657
不管汝藏於何處  盡早離開
Goat red, on wood fed, hold on fast.

574
01:18:46,787 --> 01:18:49,354
以仁慈的聖靈之御名宣告
Head and tail, evil eye release this child.

575
01:18:49,745 --> 01:18:51,876
神聖之體汝將永不得靠近  惡靈退散
Cast the devil into the wild.

576
01:18:53,137 --> 01:18:54,572
真丟臉
Shameful!

577
01:18:54,703 --> 01:18:58,269
可恥
Disgraceful!

578
01:18:58,355 --> 01:19:03,357
他們用這法子把我叔叔治好了  他可得過霍亂
They cured my uncle this way... and he had cholera!

579
01:19:03,444 --> 01:19:06,228
你兒子沒有病  他就快成為男人啦
Your son's not sick! He's becoming a man!

580
01:19:06,314 --> 01:19:09,532
雞雞都這麼大了  他需要性生活
With a dick this big, he needs to fuck!

581
01:19:18,839 --> 01:19:19,970
雷納多
Renato!

582
01:19:26,494 --> 01:19:28,407
雷納多  在這等我
Renato, wait here for me.

583
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:38,714
過來  快點  把門關上
Come here. Come on. Close the door.

584
01:19:38,889 --> 01:19:41,280
- 我爸爸呢  - 他來了
- My father? - He's coming.

585
01:19:41,888 --> 01:19:44,106

01:20:59,562 --> 01:21:01,866
洛佩塔  帶他上去吧

594
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:23,959
今晚我們不是被炸死就是進牢房
Tonight we either die in a bombing or end up in jail.

595
01:21:28,657 --> 01:21:29,831

Go ahead.

596
01:23:14,553 --> 01:23:17,163
- 這是你的第一次嗎  - 不是
- Is it your first time? - No.

597
01:23:18,946 --> 01:23:20,903
我在腦海裏做過無數次了
I've imagined it many times.

598
01:24:42,490 --> 01:24:46,056
走  去給那個婊子一點教訓
Let's go give that shameless whore what she deserves.

599
01:24:51,275 --> 01:24:54,058
退後  這是女人的事
Stay back. This is between the women.

600
01:26:22,995 --> 01:26:26,126
你現在知道勾引我們的男人
Now you'll see what happens when you steal our men...

601
01:26:36,563 --> 01:26:38,738
以及和猥瑣的德國人睡覺是什麼下場了吧
and sleep with the filthy Germans.

602
01:26:41,478 --> 01:26:43,391
你今天賣春賣到頭了  婊子
It's the end of spreading your legs, whore!

603
01:27:00,744 --> 01:27:02,439
現在來看看當婊子的下場
Now let's see what men make of you!

604
01:27:08,746 --> 01:27:11,138
這個女人活該
The madame is served.

605

607
01:32:19,045 --> 01:32:21,871
- 我認識那個人  - 誰啊

608
01:32:24,698 --> 01:32:27,047
尼諾·斯克迪亞  瑪蓮娜的丈夫
Nino Scordia, Malena's husband.

609
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:30,439
瑪蓮娜  那個和德國人搞的
Malena, the one who did it with the Germans.

610
01:32:36,658 --> 01:32:40,616
可憐的傢伙  他死了更好
Poor guy. He was better off dead.

611
01:32:47,095 --> 01:32:48,748
那不是瑪蓮娜的丈夫嗎
Isn't that Malena's husband?

612
01:33:15,842 --> 01:33:19,147
嘿  喬瓦尼  來了個生人
Hey, Giovanni, there's a strange guy.

613
01:33:28,498 --> 01:33:30,107
你認識瑪蓮娜·斯克迪亞嗎
Do you know Malena Scordia?

614
01:33:30,933 --> 01:33:32,064
她是誰
Who's she?

615
01:33:32,237 --> 01:33:34,672
你是誰  這是我家的房子
Who are you? This is my family's house!

616
01:33:34,673 --> 01:33:36,587
我們什麼都不知道
We don't know anything.

617
01:33:36,761 --> 01:33:39,413
我們來的時候  這裏已經沒人住了
When we came, no one was living here.

618
01:33:39,545 --> 01:33:41,066
一個人都沒有嗎
No one?

619
01:33:56,506 --> 01:33:59,202
可憐的傢伙  沒人會把事實告訴他的
Poor guy. No one will tell him the truth.

620
01:33:59,288 --> 01:34:03,203
你怎麼說  我聽說你老婆做妓女了
What would you say, "I hear your wife is a prostitute"?

621
01:34:03,289 --> 01:34:06,986
聽說她屁股還是很翹
I hear she's still a great piece of ass.

622
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:10,553
我斷了個胳膊  我又沒死
I lost an arm. I wasn't dead!

623
01:34:10,683 --> 01:34:15,075
然後我被俘虜到印度並且得了瘧疾  告訴他
Then I was taken prisoner in India and I contracted malaria. Tell him.

624
01:34:15,249 --> 01:34:17,728
先生  他丟了條胳膊
Sir, he lost his arm...

625
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:20,164
嘿  哪裏的孩子  在這幹嘛  快走
Hey, kid, what are you doing here? Go away.

626
01:34:20,772 --> 01:34:22,034
我是服務生  咖啡

628
01:34:26,078 --> 01:34:27,253
好的  好的
Okay, alright.

629
01:34:28,297 --> 01:34:31,297
我家人世世代代生活在鎮上
My family has lived in this town for generations.

630
01:34:31,471 --> 01:34:33,602
現在沒人願意跟我說話
Now no one will talk to me.

631
01:34:33,689 --> 01:34:35,168
家也成了難民營  老婆也不見了
My house is a refugee camp, and my wife has disappeared.

632
01:34:35,255 --> 01:34:38,256
鎮上沒人知道她在哪裏
No one in town knows where she is.

633
01:34:39,690 --> 01:34:42,256
他老婆就是那個女人
His wife was the woman

634
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:44,997
就是我們來這裏的時候看到被打的那個
we saw beaten up on the day we arrived here.

635
01:34:45,170 --> 01:34:47,954
人人都說她是妓院裏的妓女
Everybody says she's a prostitute in a whorehouse.

636

Excuse me. Don't you remember me? I'm Nino Scordia.

- 你認錯人了  - 能借個火嗎
- You mistake me for someone else. - Could I have a light?

639
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:26,573
你是法西斯的秘書  你是他的代理人
You were the Fascist secretary, and you were his deputy.

640
01:35:27,268 --> 01:35:28,530
幫我個忙  知不知道我老婆到底怎麼了
You can help me. Do you know what happened to my wife?

641
01:35:28,704 --> 01:35:31,008
她沒有加入共產黨嗎
Didn't she join the Communist Party?

642
01:35:32,617 --> 01:35:36,749
她有張摟著共產黨頭目的照片
She was photographed with her arms around the Commie leader.

643
01:35:39,445 --> 01:35:42,011
你們一家都是英雄
You're a family of heroes!

644
01:35:44,056 --> 01:35:45,708
沒錯
You're right.

645
01:35:46,230 --> 01:35:50,318
那些為你們這些混蛋戰鬥的人不是英雄
Those who fought the war for you bastards aren't heroes.

646
01:35:51,709 --> 01:35:54,798
去西西里的妓院逛逛吧
Go take a walk through the brothels of Sicily.

647
01:35:54,971 --> 01:35:58,537
說不定能找到你老婆
You may find your wife there!

648
01:36:59,118 --> 01:37:03,033
等等  回來
Wait a minute. Come back!

<i>原諒我沒有勇氣面對面告訴你</i>
<i>forgive me if I don't have the courage to speak man to man.</i>

653
01:37:23,517 --> 01:37:27,778

<i>but back then, you had been dead along time.</i>

01:37:42,609 --> 01:37:47,349
<i>我最後一次見到她的時候  她在去墨西拿的火車上</i>
<i>The last time I saw her, she was on a train for Messina.</i>

659
01:37:47,653 --> 01:37:51,828
<i>我本應該像所有的匿名信一樣  署名  一個朋友</i>
<i>I should sign "a friend," like all anonymous letters,</i>

660
01:37:52,002 --> 01:37:53,872
<i>但我叫雷納多</i>

664
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:43,103
把它吃光  小甜心
Eat up, my sweet pea.

665
01:38:56,585 --> 01:38:58,585
- 我操  - 看誰來了
- Sons of bitches! - Look who's here!

666
01:38:59,542 --> 01:39:01,499
喬治奧  看誰來了
Giorgio, look who's here!

667
01:40:03,255 --> 01:40:06,038
你們為什麼都看那個女人
Why are you all looking at that woman?

668
01:40:06,168 --> 01:40:07,646
沒什麼
It's nothing.

669
01:40:35,828 --> 01:40:38,655
我在廣場上看到他們了  挽著胳膊走的
I saw them in the square. They were walking arm in arm.

670
01:40:38,742 --> 01:40:40,786
安靜點  她在這

我聽說了  但我不信
I heard it, but I didn't believe it.

674
01:40:52,049 --> 01:40:54,964
- 他們非得看些什麼  - 他們應該隨她一個人去
- What have they got to look at? - They should leave her in peace.

675
01:40:57,921 --> 01:41:00,443
她眼角多了些皺紋
She's got some wrinkles around her eyes.

676

697
01:44:00,795 --> 01:44:05,100
<i>問我是不是會記得她們</i>
<i>and asked if I will remember them,</i>

698
01:44:05,101 --> 01:44:10,406
<i>我會說  是的  我會記得你</i>
<i>I've said, "Yes, I will remember you."</i>

699
01:44:10,580 --> 01:44:14,451
