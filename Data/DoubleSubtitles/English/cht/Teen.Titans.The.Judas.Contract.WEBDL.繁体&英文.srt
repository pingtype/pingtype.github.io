My sister, Komand'r, staged a coup and took the throne.

64
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,370
我不得不逃走
I had to flee.

65
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,600
但我很快就會回去
But I will soon return.

66
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,900
好吧 你可以跟我們呆在一起 直到你想出解決辦法來
Well, you can stay with us until you figure it out.

67
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,270
好嗎
Okay?

68
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,470
好的 請麻煩你
Yes, please.

69
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,040
我尋求兩到三天的庇護
I will ask sanctuary for two or three days.

70
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,580
最長一周
A week at the longest.

71
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,450
讓我來為你介紹我的朋友們
Let me introduce you to my friends.

72
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,250
哦對了 我能說點西班牙語
Oh, by the way, I speak some Spanish,

73
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,450
倘若你想學的話...
if you wanna learn that.

74
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,060
還有法語
Second year high school French.

75
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,430
歡迎來到少年泰坦
Welcome to the Teen Titans.

76
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,780
小心點你個蠢貨
Careful, you fool.

77
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,520
這設備比你的命都值錢
This equipment is worth more than your lives.

78
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,290
什麼
What?

79
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,790
少年泰坦在不到一分鐘的時間裏就會找過來
The Titans will be there in less than a minute.

80
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,830
我怎麼沒看出來
I see no signs of that.

81
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,730
信 或者不信 你的選擇
Believe, don't believe, your choice.

82
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,420
他們有防備
They're ready.

83
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,890
可惜太慢了
They're slow.

84
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,890
我還沒有回貼
I hardly had time to answer a post.

85
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,430
爬上去太明顯了 而且還有月光
It's a tough climb, especially in this moonlight.

86
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,470
夜翼
Nightwing.

87
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,730
它們會發現我們的
They're bound to spot us.

88
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,570
夜翼
Nightwing.

89
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,900
如果我們等那些雲
If we wait for those clouds...

90
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,970
迪克
Dick!

91
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,040
幹嘛
What?

92
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,810
土石女會把我們帶上去的
Terra is taking us up there.

93
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:20,970
是嗎
She is?

94
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,580
是 這兒所有髒活都是我的
Yeah, I do all the dirty work around here.

95
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,120
往上
Going up.

96
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,460
你離開太久了 牛仔
You've been gone a long time, cowboy.

97
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,430
行動
Let's move.

98
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,210
安靜
Quiet down.

99
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,440
聖甲蟲在害怕
The bug is nervous.

100
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,580
我也沒多少信心
I'm not feeling too good about this myself.

101
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,780
你怎麼能這麼冷靜
How come you're so calm?

102
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,720
因為你從沒當過地鼠
You have never been a gopher.

103
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,090
聖甲蟲 停下來
Scarab, stop.

104
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,220
你最好控制住那東西 甲殼蟲
Control that thing, Beetle,

105
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,030
要麼我就替你動手了
or I'll control it for you.

106
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,690
你打算在這地方舞刀弄槍
You're going to have a sword fight in here?

107
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,630
要不給你換個更像樣點的地方  比如掃帚間
How about some place roomier like a broom closet?

108
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,270
所有人 冷靜下來
Everyone, calm down.

109
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,700
敵人就在我們上面
The enemy is above us.

110
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,570
任務是一切
You have to channel all your thoughts to that.

111
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,100
記住 這些不是一般的敵人
Remember, these opponents are different.

112
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,140
呃 就像柯莉告訴你們的那樣
Uh, as Kori will tell you.

113
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,970
不不 沒關係請繼續講
No, keep going.

114
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,240
自從我離開泰坦 我一直在研究這些敵人
I've been studying them since I left the Titans.

115
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,250
他們是極端狂熱份子
They're zealots, extremists.

116
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,080
為了打倒你 他們可以不眨眼睛就犧牲掉自己
They'll sacrifice themselves without hesitation to get to you.

117
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,450
所以 我們得盡快打敗他們 越快越好
So, the quicker we take them down, the better.

118
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,550
這樣差不多了
That about cover it?

119
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,620
講的非常好
Very well said.

120
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,620
土石女 你還能堅持住嗎
Terra, can you do this?

121
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,530
當然 倘若你們都閉嘴的話
Yes, if you'd all shut up.

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,440
現在距離地板只有六英尺
We're six inches under the floor.

123
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,670
誰想敲敲門
Who wants to knock?

124
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,620
泰坦 出擊
Titans, go!

125
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,130
謝謝帶我們潛入了這個壓根沒法潛入的蜂巢基地 土石女
Thanks for getting us into the impenetrable H.I.V.E base, Terra.

126
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,700
是啊 你是最棒的
Yeah, you're the best.

127
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,740
這個壞蛋是你的 老媽
This bad guy is yours, mama.

128
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,180
土石女 跟緊我們
Terra, stay with us.

129
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,850
說得好像我一沒你們就不行了
Like I couldn't take out all these jokers by myself.

130
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,690
我們這裏已經暴露了
We've been compromised.

131
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,260
遺棄基地
Abandon the base.

132
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,970
他們準備得還不錯
They prepared well.

133
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,570
反應也迅速
Their reaction time is much better.

134
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,800
羅賓 別再恭維這些壞蛋了
Robin, stop complementing the bad guys.

135
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,140
至少有一點他說對了 時刻準備著
But he's right. Be ready for anything.

136
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,780
這些傢伙的裝備肯定是批發的
These dudes must buy their bad guy stuff in bulk.

137
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,280
要不我們試試你上週末教我的那個怎麼樣
How about we do that move you taught me last weekend?

138
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,850
在這地方
Now?

139
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,020
我無所謂 但他們就不知道了
I admire your boldness, but what will the team think?

140
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,160
等等 不是這意思
What? No, not...

141
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,360
好吧 我怕了你
Okay, you got me.

142
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,060
是說我們訓練的那一招 請
The training move, please.

143
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,190
上卡車
Get in the truck.

144
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,870
你們的義務已盡
Your service has come to an end.

145
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,670
再見
Bless you all.

146
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,800
小心點 哥們兒 那些可是我的朋友
Watch it, dude. Those are my friends.

147
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,240
別搞得在像在管束你舍友一樣 甲殼
At least act like you're trying to keep your parasite in line, Beetle.

148
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,750
膽子真小
That was unbearable.

149
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,980
你說呢
Get it?

150
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,750
無聊
Seriously?

151
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,530
你能別把自己暴露給敵人嗎
Could you not leave yourself open like that?

152
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,830
我擔心
I worry.

153
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,290
對不起寶貝
I'm sorry, babe.

154
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,800
我最近想了很多
I've been doing a lot of thinking lately.

155
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,130
關於什麼的
About what?

156
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,280
我覺得我們的關係應該進展到下一步
I think we should take the next step in our relationship.

157
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,280
下次再說
To be continued.

158
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,160
說茄子
Say cheese,

159
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,960
發送
and post.

160
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,230
晚上一起看電影怎麼樣
Hey, how about a movie tonight?

161
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,900
繼續走你的 馬蓋拉
Keep moving, Magilla.

162
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,840
基地是我們的了
The base is ours.

163
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,710
剛才我們被打斷前 你打算說什麼來著
So, what were you saying before we were interrupted?

164
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,480
我
I...

165
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,690
好吧 哪都一樣
Okay, good a place as any.

166
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,460
我在城裏有一所公寓
I got an apartment in the city.

167
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,400
也許我們能分享一下
I hoped, maybe, we could share, you know,

168
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,470
你知道 住一起
together.

169
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,730
哦 好吧
Oh, snap!

170
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,670
裏面竟然不是一顆石頭
No rock?

171
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,940
這可真夠差勁的
That's so lame.

172
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,780
在塔瑪拉 我們其實很隨便的
On Tamaran, everyone would gossip.

173
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,510
所以我們可以住在一起
So it's a good thing we live here.

174
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,950
我覺得他們不太傳統
What I'm getting is that they're too good to hang with us.

175
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,760
是嗎 你在嫉妒嗎
Yeah, that's the takeaway.

176
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,330
粉絲過百萬了
Hey, I'm over a million followers!

177
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,560
我贏了
Call me Jefe.

178
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,990
你得把注意力放在遊戲上
You need to get your head in the game, gar.

179
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,130
或者你的心思在另一種遊戲上
Or, maybe your head is in a different game.

180
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,070
我這麼棒 竟然沒人約我
Who wouldn't want to date me? I'm awesome.

181
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,240
可我不管做什麼 都沒用
But everything I do pisses her off.

182
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,570
想聽聽我的建議
Want my advice?

183
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,140
別再變成猩猩然後去偷吻了
Quit turning into a chimp and stealing monkey kisses.

184
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,040
可人們覺得那樣可愛啊
People think that's adorable.

185
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,980
不 沒人那麼想
Nope, no one thinks that.

186
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,350
好了
Time out.

187
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,080
我得去打通電話
Gotta make a call.

188
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,350
土石女
Terra.

189
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,020
陪我過幾招
Would you like to join me?

190
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,950
這東西能幫我沉下心來
The staff helps clear the mind.

191
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,290
不 謝謝
No thanks.

192
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,820
我只想離那綠豆子遠一點
I'm just trying to avoid green bean for a while.

193
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,390
我從來都不關心動物園發生了什麼
I never cared much for the zoo.

194
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,530
如果他騷擾你..
If he's bothering you...

195
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,900
他只是個混蛋
He's just a jerk.

196
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,440
關於她的流言是真的嗎
Is it true what they say about her,

197
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,470
她父親被她困在了她額間的寶石裏
that she has her father trapped in that Jewel on her head?

198
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,080
是的 他的名字叫鬼父
Yes, his name is Trigon.

199
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,650
他是一個惡魔
He's a demon.

200
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,980
他們之間有間隙
They have issues.

201
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,550
好吧 起碼她知道去哪能找到她的父親
Well, she knows where she can find him.

202
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,020
你該多和她談談
You should talk to her more.

203
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,050
你就會發現渡鴉非常
You'll find that Raven can be quite

204
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,360
有趣
interesting.

205
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,930
不 謝謝了 我有點怕她
No thanks. Too creepy for me.

206
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,470
米拉格羅 聽起來不錯
Sounds like a good time, Milagro.

207
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,100
你拿到我的禮物了嗎
Did you get my gift?

208
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:15,510
當然 永遠的十七歲的禮品卡 我的最愛
Sure did. Gift card to the seventeen forever. My favorite.

209
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,980
媽媽和爹地想跟你說話 愛你
Mom and dad wanna say hi. Love you.

210
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,850
瞧我的寶貝兒子
There's my baby boy!

211
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,520
你能吃飽飯嗎
Are you getting enough to eat?

212
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,490
是啊 你過得怎麼樣
Yeah, how's it goin'?

213
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,090
還是不太喜歡我 哼
Still doesn't like me, huh?

214
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,490
他在改變
It's getting better.

215
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,860
別提那東西了
Let's not talk about that thing.

216
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,630
轉眼兩年過去了
It's been two years.

217
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,000
我正在努力 爸爸
I'm working on it, dad.

218
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,700
但這很難 你知道
But it's hard, you know.

219
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,000
他有自己的想法
It's got a mind of its own.

220
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,700
還有自己的脾氣 奧多
- And a temper. - Aldo.

221
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,410
他和一群超級英雄在一起
For god's sake. He's with a bunch of super heroes.

222
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,740
超人或是誰能把那東西弄下來
You think superman or someone could take that thing off him.

223
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,380
你應該冷靜一點
You're supposed to calm down.

224
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,880
我們不能把每次通電話都這樣結束
We can't have every call end this way, Aldo.

225
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,620
海梅不想我們討論這個問題
Jaime won't wanna talk to us.

226
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,250
為什麼是蛋糕
Why is the cake

227
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,550
出去嗎 這不是時候
coming out? It's not time!

228
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,160
啊 你的姨媽 慷蘇拉 簡直神經了
Ah, your aunt, Consuela, esta loca.

229
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,460
去吧 媽媽 我們可以之後再聊
Go, mom, we can talk later.

230
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,230
我愛你 海梅
I love you, Jaime.

231
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,290
保重
Be good.

232
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,060
慷蘇拉 把蛋糕給我
Consuela, give me that cake!

233
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,170
我最好也走了
I better go too.

234
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,170
真抱歉 只是
I'm sorry. It's just...

235
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,710
我想我的兒子
I miss my son.

236
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,060
正在打開最近的 血兄弟 片段
Accessing most recent footage on brother blood.

237
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:45,900
一派胡言
Lies.

238
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,670
我的教堂是神聖的地方
My church is a holy place

239
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,870
我們唯一的使命是做正確的事
and we strive only to do good.

240
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,570
拜託  血兄弟
Come now, brother blood.

241
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,010
你的教堂難道不是另一個光榮化的邪教嗎
Isn't your church just a glorified cult?

242
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,910
不像你 布賴斯 我堅信著美國
Unlike you, Bryce, I believe in an America

243
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,310
所有信仰都應被給予應有的尊重
where all beliefs should be treated with respect.

244
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,450
可恥的事媒體認為並非如此
It's a shame the press doesn't.

245
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:08,220
恐怕這是我們能從血會得到的所有消息了
I'm afraid that's all we're going to get from brother blood.

246
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,690
我是彼得森 布賴斯
I'm Bryce Peterson.

247
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,460
晚安
-Have a good night.

248
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,330
祖父一定會為血兄弟
Grandfather would have been impressed with blood,

249
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:16,060
經營著像蜂巢一樣一個世界範圍的邪教而驕傲
running a worldwide cult as well as H.I.V.E.

250
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,460
他們本為一體
They're the same thing.

251
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,370
只是讓他們看起來是分開的而已
He just makes them look separate.

252
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,940
你從來都不脫掉那制服嗎
Do you ever get out of that uniform?

253
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,540
只有洗澡時候才脫
Only when I bathe.

254
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,610
也許是時候了
Might be time.

255
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,180
沒味道
I'm good.

256
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,150
我出去了
Goin' out.

257
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,780
我聽說你總是出去
I hear you're gone a lot.

258
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,550
你去哪
Where do you go?

259
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:41,320
你知道我是不需要大人管小孩
You realize I'm not a child who needs permission to go outside.

260
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,760
對吧
Correct?

261
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,590
達米安 我不是在審問
Damien, I wasn't interrogating.

262
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,790
只是感興趣而已
Just taking an interest.

263
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
我出去巡邏
I go out on patrol.

264
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,500
對了  恭喜你有了新歡 格雷森
By the way, I should offer congratulations on your cohabitation, Grayson.

265
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,170
星火證明她是一個夠格的領袖
Starfire has proven herself to be a decent leader.

266
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,140
我同意
I approve.

267
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,510
謝謝你
Thank you.

268
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,310
你在蜂巢文件裏找到什麼了嗎
Have you found anything in the H.I.V.E. Files?

269
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,010
沒什麼  但我仍在查
Nothing Earth-shaking, but I'm still checking.

270
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,250
聽起來你什麼都沒查到
Sounds like you got squat.

271
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,280
我至少還能享受下正常生活
I love endangering my life for nothing.

272
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,020
上次突襲拿到的新的文件
Which is why I've added the newest files to the ones

273
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,350
已經損毀的無法閱讀了
too damaged to read, from the previous raids.

274
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,220
希望電腦能為我們找到其中的關聯
I'm hoping the computer will find a connection we missed.

275
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,930
程序得花一到兩天處理這些信息
It may take the program a day or two.

276
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,490
至少還有希望
Not your worst idea.

277
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,700
幹嘛
What?

278
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,640
呃
Ugh!

279
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,940
嘿 你們誰見傑米了
Hey, anyone seen Jaime?

280
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,140
他就在那兒
Yeah, he's right there.

281
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,850
有點不對勁
Something is wrong.

282
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,780
是啊 他輸掉球賽了
Yeah, there is. He's about to be crushed at Foosball.

283
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,980
你想來瞧瞧嘛
You wanna come see?

284
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,050
起開
Buzz off.

285
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,560
也許你應該去
Maybe you should go.

286
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,790
也許你們兩個都去是個好主意
Might be good to have two of you down there.

287
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,470
如我所說 不服從的人
And I say to you. Those who deny the chosen,

288
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,070
在即將建立的樂園中沒有棲腳的地方
have no place in the Eden that shall be built.

289
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,010
罪人和褻瀆者 那些與我們價值觀念不同的人
Sinners and blasphemers who do not share our values

290
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,140
將被拋棄
need not apply,

291
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,980
兄弟姊妹們
brothers and sisters.

292
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,680
全能的 兄弟血會
Hail, brother blood!

293
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,050
萬歲 萬歲 萬歲
Hail, hail, hail.

294
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,720
全能的 血色兄弟
Hail, brother blood.

295
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,890
萬歲 萬歲 萬歲
Hail, hail, hail...

296
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,090
啊 你在這兒 邁赫姆
Ah, there you are, mayhem.

297
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,230
你為何
Punctual as always.

298
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,640
這麼冷靜的
How can you be so calm?

299
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,240
這是第三個被少年泰坦摧毀的基地
That was the third base the Titans have destroyed.

300
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,840
我的計劃歷經九百年的風雨
My plan is nine centuries in the making.

301
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,440
每個年代都有人反抗
In every age, there are always those who oppose me.

302
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,850
但如你所見
But as you can see,

303
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,720
我總是贏家
I am always victorious.

304
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,820
這是那個記者嗎
Is that the reporter?

305
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,060
是他
Yes.

306
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,790
我們的朋友再也不會問出那些粗魯的問題了
Our friend won't be asking impertinent questions anymore.

307
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,400
他的質疑遠不及少年泰坦帶來的威脅
His heresy does not compare to the titan's threat.

308
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,670
我們幾乎無法逃脫他們
We barely escaped them.

309
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,000
但你做到了
But you did,

310
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,400
因為他警告過你
because he warned you.

311
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,540
我們的守護天使
Our guardian angel.

312
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,970
別做無謂的擔心了
Oh, stop your fretting, mayhem.

313
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,310
他會保證泰坦不搗亂
He'll keep the Titans at bay.

314
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,280
我已預見
I've foreseen it.

315
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,620
再加上 我付那混蛋足夠的錢
Plus, I pay the bastard enough.

316
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,500
你能慢點嗎 傑米
Could you slow down, Jaime?

317
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,300
那你回塔上吧
Go back to the tower then.

318
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,700
沒人請你來
Nobody asked you to come.

319
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,970
噢 別這樣 我們可是挺你的
Oh, come on. We're here to support you.

320
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,240
我可不是
I'm not.

321
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:52,850
我的意思是 我尊重傑米的意見
What I mean is, I respect Jaime not wanting to talk.

322
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,350
事實上 有些人應該好好學學怎麼閉上他的嘴巴
In fact, more people should learn to shut their mouths.

323
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,780
好吧 那可真沒意思
Well, that's no fun.

324
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,060
呃 好吧 我閉嘴
Uh, okay, I give up.

325
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,330
瞧
The center.

326
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:10,330


327
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,000
我的父母在鄉下也做義工
My parents volunteer for the one in my town.

328
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,070
所以....
And...

329
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,840
也許我也該做義工
Maybe I should volunteer.

330
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,570
是的 沒錯兒
Yeah, right.

331
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,310
我們是泰坦
We're Titans.

332
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,740
我們不是給人舀湯的
We don't serve soup.

333
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,210
你不需要非得移動座山
You don't have to move a mountain

334
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,340
才算幫助別人 泰拉
to help people, Terra.

335
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,280
況且 我得想個辦法
Besides, I gotta find a way to make the bug

336
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
讓蟲子在人類附近覺得更加舒服
more comfortable around humans.

337
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,020
我能幫你什麼嗎
Can I help you?

338
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,090
是的 呃
Yes, um,

339
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,730
崔西
Traci.

340
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,430
我想知道如果我想做義務勞動應該找誰
I was wondering who I can speak to about volunteering?

341
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,760
找我就對了
That would be me.

342
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,570
這下好了
And there it is.

343
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,930
僅僅因為我們的超能力
Just because we have powers

344
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,000
並不意味著我們就不能 你知道
doesn't mean we can't, you know,

345
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,440
建立關係
have relationships.

346
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,710
你不覺得嗎
Don't you think?

347
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,410
嘿 享受生活沒錯兒 對嗎
Hey, there's nothing wrong with having a life, right?

348
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,710
殺了她
Kill her!

349
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,250
殺了這個惡魔
Kill the demon!

350
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,050
怎麼了
What's the matter?

351
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,260
沒什麼
Nothing.

352
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,930
真是差勁 我要離開
This is lame. I'm out.

353
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:24,800
在這千年裏  我在敵人的血中沐浴
For nearly a millennium, I have bathed in my enemy's blood,

354
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,770
這麼做
and for some mysterious reason,

355
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,240
可以使我永生
it has provided me immortality.

356
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,110
我總是好奇為什麼
I have often wondered why?

357
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,350
為什麼是我
Why me?

358
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,880
但現在我知道了
But now I know.

359
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,220
這是 天意讓我
It was meant to bring me to this age,

360
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,350
在此地 在此時
this place, this moment,

361
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:46,490
借助科技的力量
where technology can at last be made to serve my greatness.

362
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,730
運行
Proceed.

363
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,080
你做的非常好
You've done well.

364
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,920
開始準備 邁赫姆 時機已到
Advance the preparations, mayhem. The time has come

365
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,620
讓我們永生之榮耀
for us to move from immortality to glory.

366
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,560
多謝你的付出
Your service has come to an end.

367
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,530
祝福你 我的孩子
Bless you, my son.

368
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,440
作為宇宙公主
For a space Princess,

369
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,010
你的東西還真不少
you sure have a lot of stuff.

370
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,650
我還是小女孩的時候就有這個了
I've had this since I was a little girl.

371
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,820
這是我唯一有時間拿走的東西
It was the only thing I had time to take.

372
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,230
又來
Not again.

373
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,830
泰拉 你還好嗎
Terra, are you okay?

374
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,540
她就快要把整個樓都弄到了
She's going to bring the building down.

375
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,970
我能幫助她
I can help.

376
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,980
你在幹嗎
What are you doing?

377
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,080
滾開
Get off me!

378
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,380
你在發動你的能力  土石女
You were shaking everything, Terra.

379
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,680
我們來看你
We came to check on you.

380
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,750
你還好嗎
Are you all right?

381
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,420
只是個該死的噩夢罷了
It's a freaking nightmare.

382
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,120
你們快走吧 讓我一個人靜一靜
Just leave me alone.

383
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:57,020
我很好 所以 走吧
I'm okay, so, get going.

384
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,960
你們聽見我說的樂 走啊
You heard me. Get going.

385
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,130
還有你 綠豆芽
You too, greeny.

386
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,770
這種事發生得多嗎
Does that happen a lot?

387
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,140
足夠多
It happens enough.

388
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,510
你看到什麼了 什麼都沒看到
- What did you see? - Nothing.

389
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,310
而且就算我看到任何東西也跟你沒關係
And if I did see anything, it wouldn't be your business.

390
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:21,680
塔裏發生的一切都跟我有關係
Everything that goes on in the tower is my business.

391
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,980
不管是誰
Just like it should be for all of you.

392
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,990
據我所知 達米安 柯莉安才是頭 而不是你
The last I checked, Damien, Kori was in charge, not you.

393
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:38,200
很高興再次見到你 我的朋友
So good to see you again, my friends.

394
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,970
已經過去太長的時間
It's been too long.

395
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:44,100
太長了
Too long.

396
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,010
別把這搞得神經兮兮 布拉德
Don't make this weirder than it already is, blood.

397
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,640
你是說裝束
Are you referring to the setting?

398
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,880
我自己從中獲取力量
I myself take strength from it.

399
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,650
墓地不是一個該被畏懼的地方
The cemetery isn't a place to be feared.

400
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,280
而是重生的地方
It's a place of renewal.

401
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,350
對你我見面的地方我沒有任何意見
I have no problem meeting anywhere you want,

402
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:02,820
但我擔心我的僱主是個神經病
but I get concerned when my employer talks to himself.

403
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:05,560
我在跟死者說話
I talk to the dead,

404
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:11,200
無論屍體如何腐爛 總是有一線生氣存留
for no matter how rotted the corpse, there's always a tiny wisp of life left.

405
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,930
有時候足夠把它們帶回來
Sometimes enough life to bring them back.

406
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,270
你們都該明白
You of all people should know that.

407
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,310
你想要什麼 布拉德
What do you want, blood?

408
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,840
我想在一周內得到進展
I want to move everything up by a week.

409
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,740
我已經等待了足夠久的時間 喪鐘
I've waited long enough, Deathstroke.

410
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,210
這不是我們約好的
That wasn't the deal.

411
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,420
我會付你雙倍的酬金
I'll double your price.

412
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,550
這可以接受嗎
Is that acceptable?

413
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,990
就像之前 我要所有的泰坦
As before, I want all the Titans.

414
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,090
你能做到嗎
Can you do it?

415
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,660
時刻準備著
To be ready for anything,

416
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,930
你們必須為一切情況而訓練
you must train for everything.

417
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,840
這是歐喀拉的軍閥教我的
That was the most important lesson

418
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,670
最 刻骨銘心的教訓
instilled in me by the warlords of Okaara.

419
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,140
又是他們
Dude... Them again?

420
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,540
老兄
Dude...

421
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:59,310
這同樣應該在你們的心中銘記
And so it shall be instilled in you.

422
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,580
讓我們對練
Let's pair off.

423
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,080
那些不在戰鬥中的 就觀察學習
Those not fighting, watch and learn.

424
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,220
夜翼
Nightwing.

425
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,790
讓我們起舞 先生
Shall we dance, good sir?

426
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,660
當然 我的女士
But of course, my lady.

427
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,380
看來我們知道是孰強孰弱了
Guess we know who's taking out the garbage at the new place.

428
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:41,650
這對你沒一點好處
That was not a confidence booster.

429
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,890
你做的非常好
You did very well.

430
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:45,320
你這次堅持的時間遠遠要比以前久
You lasted far longer this time.

431
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,590
我當然指的是訓練
I meant in training, of course.

432
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,200
當我們... 他可是非常熟練
He's very proficient when we have...

433
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,260
柯莉
Kori!

434
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,430
藍甲蟲 渡鴉
Blue Beetle, Raven.

435
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,790
抱歉 渡鴉 蟲子不想輸
Sorry, Raven, the bug doesn't wanna lose.

436
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,420
難道你想
And you do?

437
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,830
真對不起 你還好嗎
Dios mio! I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

438
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,900
你在做什麼
What the hell are you doing?

439
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,010
阿 我沒事
Ah, I'm fine.

440
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,240
父親覺得我讓自己蒙羞
But dad feels I've disgraced myself.

441
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,310
所以就很好
So that's nice.

442
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,450
野獸小子 土石女 你們準備好了嗎
Beast Boy, Terra, you ready?

443
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,260
抱歉
Right. Sorry.

444
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,930
我會讓著土石女的
I'll take it easy on Terra.

445
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,060
我可很享受讓你閉嘴
I'm gonna enjoy shutting you up.

446
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,330
除非你能抓到我 老媽
Only if you catch me, mama.

447
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,760
親愛的 就讓我給你一個大擁抱
Mon Cherie, let Garfield give you a big hug.

448
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,820
嗯 好軟
Mmm, so soft.

449
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,290
親下你再放你走
I let you go for a little kiss.

450
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,140
殺了她
Kill her!

451
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:51,520
女巫 你罪有應得
Now, witch, you get what's coming to you!

452
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,020
你管誰叫女巫
Who you calling a witch?

453
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,160
土石女
Terra!

454
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,400
她打算殺了他
She's going to kill him!

455
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,140
啊
Argh!

456
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,110
土石女 控制你自己
Terra, control yourself!

457
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,380
什麼
What?

458
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,010
怎麼回事
What's going on?

459
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,850
抱歉 這不是我的錯
I'm sorry, it's not my fault.

460
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,690
讓我平靜下你的心 不
- Let me calm your mind. - No!

461
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:32,490
別碰我 沒關係的 土石女 我們理解
- Don't touch me. -It's okay Terra, we understand.

462
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,830
放鬆
Take a breath.

463
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,390
我們在這裏是為了你
We're here for you.

464
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,030
是啊 我知道你並不想傷害我 只是我做的太過了
Yeah. I know you didn't mean to hurt me. I took it too far.

465
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,340
你們這些人是怎麼回事兒
What's wrong with you people?

466
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:09,860
我知道你打算說什麼 土石女需要更多的訓練
I know what you're going to say. Terra needs more training.

467
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,930
不 是別的事兒
No, it's something else.

468
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,470
她知道一些
She knows.

469
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,470
自從我們談過之後 我已經感受到了關於土石女的一些東西
Since we talked, I have sensed something off about Terra.

470
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,470
格雷森 我們要多注意她
She needs to be watched, Grayson.

471
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,740
她需要理解而不是監視
She needs understanding not surveillance.

472
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:28,650
土石女 她雖然不是完人  但科裏認為她是值得的
Terra, has her rough edges. But Corey thinks she's worth it.

473
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,320
我同意他的
And I agree.

474
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,950
你的仁慈 遲早會出事
Making decisions with your heart will get people killed.

475
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:05,250
不能有人和我
It's not like I can't sense the vibrations of someone following me.

476
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,290
即使他們在屋頂上
Even if they are on a roof.

477
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:10,690
我知道你不喜歡這個
I know what it's like not to fit in with the group.

478
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,930
什麼錯
What's wrong?

479
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:18,000
猴子男孩 渡鴉
Aside from monkey boy making me melt down, or Raven staring all the time,

480
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,230
還有夜翼 像個老媽媽 海梅還有他的甲蟲
Nightwing, acting like a den mother, Jaime and his freako bug,

481
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,940
嗯 還有你 我的又一個暗戀者
miss smiles-a-lot, and you, my new stalker,

482
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,470
你沒什麼要說吧
huh, nothing I guess.

483
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,440
你需要我們的幫助
If you need to talk

484
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,410
就告訴我們
let us help you.

485
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:38,320
多麼貼心的男孩
Such an observant, considerate boy.

486
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,650
你不會是真心的吧
You would think he truly cares.

487
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:45,020
斯萊德 你還沒死啊
Slade? Look what hell just spit up.

488
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,390
退後
Stay back.

489
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:54,670
讓我猜猜 他們不要你嗎
Let me guess, they got you to a Lazarus pit, just in time.

490
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:58,300
先讓你過過嘴癮
Yes, I've been bathing in it quite a bit, lately.

491
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,440
待會就
You might say, it's addictive.

492
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,040
要你哭
Improves muscle tone too.

493
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,930
你的鋒芒沒了
Losing your edge.

494
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:25,200
你的朋友讓你變的軟弱
Your friends have made you soft.

495
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,380
就像我說的
Like I said, soft.

496
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,750
怎麼這麼久
Took you long enough.

497
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:58,400
你背叛了我們 為什麼
You betrayed us, why?

498
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,800
背叛
Betrayed?

499
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,240
我從來就不是你們這邊的
That assumes I was ever on your side in the first place.

500
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,290
給你 費爾南德斯先生
There you go, Mr. Fernandez.

501
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:24,590
- 很高興有你的幫忙  謝謝你 不
- Great to have your help. Thanks. - No.

502
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,960
應該是我說謝謝
Thank you.

503
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,960
這裏
I kinda needed this.

504
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,230
讓我想起了家
This just reminds me of home.

505
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:34,100
高溫 小心
- Ow! Huh, hot. - Careful.

506
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,400
你可不想被燒傷吧
You don't wanna get burned.

507
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,370
你有聽到什麼嗎
Do you hear that?

508
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,780
好像在那
- I heard it before. - Uh...

509
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,280
我希望他們命夠長
I hope there's not a short.

510
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,450
我想我知道它們在哪裏
I think I heard it move over there.

511
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,020
我知道我心跳的很厲害
I know my pulse is racing.

512
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,890
但我沒有危險 沒有
But I'm in no danger. None.

513
00:34:54,890 --> 00:35:00,790
不需要防禦措施   我 怎麼解釋
Defensive measures are not needed. Oh, boy, how do I explain this?

514
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:04,430
稱為性吸引力
There's something humans call sexual attraction.

515
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,170
唉 命啊
Aye, my life.

516
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,540
嗯 海梅
Uh, Jaime?

517
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,450
你在做什麼
What are you doing?

518
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:29,290
我以為這會讓你更舒服
I thought I'd get more comfortable.

519
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:31,960
不要
Don't.

520
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,490
你不能這麼做
You can't run over here at the first sign of trouble.

521
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,860
我以為我失敗了
I was losing it. I had to see you.

522
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,130
幸運的是羅賓自投羅網
Luckily taking Robin out works.

523
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,970
只是一個人而已
Grabs a handful.

524
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:43,270
想個辦法把他也弄出來
Best to get him out of the way.

525
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,240
他總是很多疑
He was suspicious.

526
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,810
永遠是
Always is.

527
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,210
他很聰明
Didn't say he was stupid.

528
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:53,280
損壞了相機鏡頭
He damaged the camera lens.

529
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,750
格林妮做的
Greenie was asking for it.

530
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,650
需要很多時間才能打敗泰坦
It's taken a year to get the information I need to defeat theTitans.

531
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,890
別動
Could've ruined everything. Stay still.

532
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,900
- 殺了她  - 殺死女巫
- Kill her! - Kill the witch!

533
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,210
殺死女巫 她是個惡魔
Kill the witch! She's a demon!

534
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,710
殺了她
Kill her now!

535
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:44,400
離開或死亡
Leave or die. Your choice.

536
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,340
馬拉姆 泰拉
Terra Markov?

537
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:57,240
我聽說你是一個特別的女孩
I heard you're a special girl.

538
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,880
這是真的嗎
Is that true?

539
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,550
我的名字是斯萊德
My name is Slade.

540
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,580
看來我找到了
Looks like I got it.

541
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,390
不 你沒有
Not yet, you haven't.

542
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,860
但你可以
But you could.

543
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:14,460
- 我們討論過這個 - 我不是一個孩子
- We discussed this. - I'm not a kid.

544
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,500
- 你說我們會在一起- 還沒 到時候
- You said we'd be together. - Not yet.

545
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,660
任務要緊
The contract is everything.

546
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,600
我們需要先處理眼前的事
We need total concentration for it.

547
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,670
你知道還有很多工作要做
You know it's taken a lot of work to get here.

548
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:27,810
- 尤其是你  - 我不想回去
- Especially by you. - I don't wanna go back.

549
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:30,840
泰坦表現的好像他們在關心我
The Titans are always acting like they care so much.

550
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,880
這讓我不知所措
It messes with my head.

551
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,610
馬上就好 泰拉
Just a little longer, Terra.

552
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:39,150
有了血會的錢 我們將有自己的刺客聯盟
With the money from blood we'll form our own league of assassins.

553
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,690
你和我
You and I.

554
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,590
將浪跡天涯
Together in every way.

555
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,070
我還沒看到過這麼多武器
I didn't see you bringing quite so many weapons to our new place.

556
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:04,780
如果你不喜歡 不不不 我喜歡
- If you don't like them... - No, no. They're great.

557
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,980
有事嗎
Is something up?

558
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,220
在訓練場的事件之後
After the incident at the training field

559
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,690
我覺得你不需要我也可以統領他們
you met with members of the team without me.

560
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:20,860
是 這不一樣
Yeah, we talked. But it wasn't a meeting.

561
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,230
柯莉 你知道我永遠不會破壞你 對吧
Kori, you know I'd never undermine you, right?

562
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,760
他們需要你
They went to you.

563
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:28,300
你是...是一個偉大的領導者
You were... Are a great leader.

564
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,540
所以 他們盼著你回來了
So, they instinctively look to you, now that you're back.

565
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,710
畢竟 我不是你們這個世界的人
After all, I'm not even from your world.

566
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,780
不要這樣
Hey. Stop.

567
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,580
泰坦們選擇你來領導他們
You were chosen by the team to lead them.

568
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:47,490
而且我不能沒有你
And have I told you how glad I am that you've chosen to move in with me?

569
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:50,090
我至少還有你
At least I was your first choice for that.

570
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:53,890
沒錯 你至少可以住我這
Yeah. Well, gar's got his house and Jaime couldn't afford the rent.

571
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,930
你這個傢伙
You brat.

572
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,130
達米安 當然
Damian! Of course.

573
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,640
真會挑時間
Perfect timing.

574
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,840
- 什麼事 - 他在做某事
- Solo? - He's working on something.

575
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,880
待會再管
Have I mentioned he approves of us?

576
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,350
復議
So do I.

577
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,620
幹嘛
Yeah? Problem?

578
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,560
沒啥事
Not yet.

579
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,560
那就再見
Nice visit.

580
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,160
我知道我們之間有矛盾
I know I'm not easy to get close to.

581
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,970
我們要談談
We have that in common, I think.

582
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:36,840
而且我也有辦法緩解你的精神問題
But I could teach you some meditation techniques.

583
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,640
讓你更好的控制自己
It might help you stay in control.

584
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,870
那 那也許
Maybe. Maybe so.

585
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,850
還有 我們要舉行聚餐活動
The other reason I'm here is to tell you the team's assembling in the common room.

586
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:50,580
你先走 我待會就來
I need a minute. You go on ahead.

587
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,260
他們知道了
They know about Robin.

588
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,460
他們不知道
They don't.

589
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,330
掠奪者 沒問題嗎
Raven, being nice?

590
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,330
我怎麼不知道有聚餐這一回事
And there's nothing scheduled.

591
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,800
除非他們知道我和你在合作
They know I'm working with you.

592
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,100
如果他們知道 就不會讓她一個人過來
If they knew, she wouldn't have come alone.

593
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,200
除非他們想讓我放下戒備
Unless they wanted to get my guard down.

594
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,470
我不知道我能不能成功
I don't think I can take them all if they're ready.

595
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,580
冷靜  他們沒有懷疑你
Calm yourself. The fools trust you.

596
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,040
放輕鬆
Use that.

597
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:38,430
驚喜
Surprise!

598
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:43,800
該死
Shit.

599
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,870
你們嚇到我了
You guys scared me.

600
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,610
你們幹什麼
We can see that.

601
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:48,600


602
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,880
- 為了我嗎 - 是的
- Are those for me? - They sure are.

603
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,650
作為你的一週年泰坦紀念日
For your one year anniversary as a member of the Titans.

604
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:56,680
- 渡鴉想出來的主意  - 我...
- It was all Raven's idea. - I...

605
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,220
從沒有人為我這麼做過這樣的事情
No one has ever done anything like this for me.

606
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,650
謝謝
Thanks.

607
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,820
非常感謝
Thanks a lot.

608
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:11,200
抹乾眼淚 開始嗨皮吧
Dry those tears and let's get this party started, mama!

609
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,930
電腦處理完了
The computer's done.

610
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:45,460
- 血會的文件  - 讓我們看看
- The one with blood's files. - Let's take a look.

611
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:48,870
文件重構和集成完成
File reconstruction and integration complete.

612
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,890


613
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:55,610
這個科學家曾經為蜂巢工作
That scientist used to work for H.I.V.E.

614
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,580
沒有找到屍體
Body never recovered.

615
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:00,550
似乎他的個人實驗室仍在為
Seems his personal lab is still being paid for

616
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:03,580
血會的子公司服務
by one of blood's holding companies.

617
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,880
泰坦們應該來看下
The Titans should look into this.

618
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,890
看來你要錯過為
Beast Boy's sending you pictures of Terra』s party.

619
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,360
泰拉舉辦的聚會了
Shame you're missing it.

620
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,030
你就這麼點本事嗎
You should go. Playing with teenagers is about your speed.

621
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:23,640
小子 激將法對我無用
I'm not gonna let you bait me, kid.

622
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,800
哦 可惜
Oh, what the hell.

623
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,540
切
Big man.

624
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,950
你不讓我離開這裏
Why not get me out of here so I can defend myself properly?

625
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:40,750
- 是不是你在害怕 - 真的嗎
- Unless, you're afraid. - Really?

626
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:45,590
把你放了 然後再打一架
You're down to hoping I'm gonna act like the biggest stooge in a b-movie?

627
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:48,090
你不這麼想嗎
Your outfit said give it a shot.

628
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:53,100
你以為你是誰
Grandson of the demon's head, you are not.

629
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:55,570
你只是一個小屁孩
You're an entitled brat.

630
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:59,900
當我崛起時你還不知在哪
I Rose from nothing while you had everything handed to you.

631
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,610
你只是一個跳樑小丑
You cost me my rightful place.

632
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:05,640
和你背叛的家庭
And the family you betrayed.

633
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:08,880
他們選擇了你
They turned on me by choosing you.

634
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,320
達米安 刺客聯盟沒了
You took my old family, Damian.

635
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:15,450
不過我會再創造一個新的
So I'll take your new one.

636
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,930
我先離開會
I should reply.

637
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:24,900
我們走的瞧
I am well and will see you soon.

638
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:30,070
你更像另一個迪克
You're more of a dick.

639
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:35,670
臥底 別打擾我
Undercover. Don't bother me.

640
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,280
我不會花很多時間
Shame I don't have more time to break you down.

641
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,350
只要一個月 我就會讓你跪地求饒
Inside a month, I'd have you bringing me my pipe and calling me papa.

642
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:47,920
斯勒德 待會再說
Slade? Get your head out of your ass.

643
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,960
- 聽到嗎 - 如果我們找到科學家
- You seeing this? -And if we do find the scientist,

644
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,590
我們要活捉他
we want him alive at all cost.

645
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,330
五分鐘後行動
We leave in five minutes.

646
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,770
乖乖呆著
Be a good boy.

647
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:31,260
小心
Careful. Watch your spacing.

648
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,280


649
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:52,750
有有沒有主意
Any idea what that gizmo is?

650
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:54,690
沒有
Nothing good.

651
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,590
待會再吵
He's deleting. I vote we stop that.

652
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,130
讓我們兩個
That makes two of us.

653
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:08,000
好吧 三個
Okay, three.

654
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:13,770
遠離電腦 就完事大吉
Step away from the computer. You won't be hurt.

655
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:52,810
你先去 我隨後到
Go after him. I'll cover you.

656
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,860
我們應該留在聚會上
We should have stayed at the party.

657
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,460
沒什麼好抱怨
Quit complaining.

658
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,810
那我就奉陪到底
Oh, you wanna play?

659
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,820
差勁
That's it? Lame.

660
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,840
你想先問他什麼
What do you want to ask him first?

661
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,950
倒霉
Bad luck for him.

662
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,890
至少不是一無所獲
At least it wasn't one of us.

663
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:14,430
話沒錯
Yes, bad luck.

664
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:17,230
就是不能和他細談了
That we couldn't speak with him about these.

665
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,370
也許他是個粉絲
Maybe he was a fan?

666
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:31,380
他們竟然在研究我們
Is it really a surprise they would study us?

667
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,280
我們幾個月前就再與他們作戰
We've been defeating them for months.

668
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,750
這裏面竟然有你
And you were after them even before that.

669
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:38,180
他們調查的如此深入
But this stuff is so in-depth.

670
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,850
在調查我們的基因構造
Things on genetic makeup.

671
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:41,720
渡鴉與野獸男孩的
Theories on Raven's power.

672
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,520
力量來源
Beast Boy's too.

673
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,260
還有藍甲蟲
And Beetle's suit.

674
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,160
但為什麼
What's it for?

675
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,090
把羅賓召回來
We need to get Robin back here.

676
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,960
你知道他這人又多不守紀
You know how stubborn he can be.

677
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,100
他是我們的成員
He's a titan. He needs to be here.

678
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:59,470
都怪蜂巢打擾了我們的聚會
Nothing like laser-spewing H.I.V.E drones to take you out of a party mood.

679
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:03,670
我決定明天中飯在中心區吃
I'm beat and I'm making lunch at the center tomorrow.

680
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,440
真會潑冷水
In more exciting news,

681
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:10,210
我明天也受邀參加凱文·史密斯的播客聚會
I've been invited to be on Kevin Smith's podcast at Metrocon tomorrow.

682
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,650
等下 星火有事宣佈
Hold up, Starfire's got something to say.

683
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:15,990
由於今天晚上的發現
With what we discovered tonight,

684
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:18,190
我們將要提高警惕
we all need to be extra vigilant

685
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:21,130
不要疏忽大意
and not take any chances.

686
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:23,430
不是吧 那可是凱文·史密斯
Are you kidding me? It's Kevin Smith.

687
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:27,200
我沒有說禁止你們自由行動
I didn't say don't do what you have planned.

688
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:31,200
提高警惕 還有保持通訊暢通
But keep your eyes and comm lines open at all times.

689
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,640
我覺得兄弟血會要有所行動了
I have a feeling whatever blood is planning tonight is just a prelude.

690
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,630
抱歉你的聚會以這種方式結束
Sorry your party was interrupted.

691
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:04,100
這也沒辦法
That's the way it goes.

692
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,840
別又跟以前一樣
Don't let all that talk back there shake you up.

693
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,110
你知道我是你這邊的
You know I got your back.

694
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,680
其他的事
It's other stuff.

695
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,680
什麼
Like what?

696
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,720
我洗耳恭聽
I'm all ears.

697
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,550
你笑起來更好看
You've a pretty smile.

698
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,630
你知道我怎麼變成孤兒的嗎
Do you know how I became an orphan?

699
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,700
嗯 你的父母去世了
Uh, your parents died?

700
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,260
不是
No.

701
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:36,400
因為我的能力 他們嚇壞了
After I got powers, they freaked.

702
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,600
他們是我為異人
Thought I was possessed or something.

703
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:42,110
對不起
I'm sorry.

704
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,010
不要這樣
Don't be.

705
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:46,580
我不需要你的憐憫
I don't need your pity.

706
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:52,350
我只是想拉近我們的關係
It can be a bond, you know?

707
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:54,490
團隊裏的每個人都有一個不幸過去
Everyone on the team's had it rough.

708
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:56,320
是啊
Yeah.

709
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,560
一個公主 穿著閃閃發光的丁字褲從垃圾桶找食物
I can tell Princess sparkle thong knows all about eating from a dumpster.

710
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:03,330
柯莉被她妹妹奪了權
Kori is a refugee being stalked by her homicidal sister.

711
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:05,360
傑米有一個愛他的家庭
Jaime has a family that loves him.

712
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:09,370
由於那個甲蟲 他不能和他的家人生活在一起
And, because of the bug, odds are he's never seeing them face-to-face again.

713
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:15,870
每個英雄都有苦處
I think pain is what makes a hero.

714
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:20,140
金無足赤,人無完人
It's like a pressure that either forms a diamond or grinds you into dust.

715
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:25,550
開心果 你呢
But what about you, chuckles?

716
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:29,020
你又沒有什麼苦處
Aside from an unhealthy online presence, you're normal.

717
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:34,090
是啊 你是綠色的
Yeah, you're green.

718
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:35,960
你不會去改變它的
You wouldn't change it if you could.

719
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,760
你喜歡引人注目
You like the attention.

720
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,100
除此在外
Besides

721
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,630
你一切正常
it looks okay on you.

722
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,260
你沒殺我
You didn't kill me.

723
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,530
這一次
This time.

724
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:13,530
說明不了什麼 笨蛋
Don't get used to it, jerk.

725
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:19,140
高興 開心
Yes! Yeah!

726
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,470
我最牛 哈哈
Whoo-hew! Yeah, baby! Ha-ha!

727
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,750
我最強
Oh, yeah, baby!

728
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:31,580
我們走吧
Let's go!

729
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:38,420
開心
Nice play.

730
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,590
一切就緒
Almost bought it myself.

731
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:43,430
我們明天行動
We move tomorrow.

732
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,400
我有點累了 加油
I'm tired, gar.

733
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:57,270
是的 當然 好的
Yeah, sure, totally get it.

734
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,780
明天見還有後天
See you tomorrow. And the next day.

735
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:31,540
我會搞的
Yeah, I got them all in.

736
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:34,450
我知道我是蠢貨但我搞的定
Hey, I know I'm a noob but I got this.

737
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,350
再見
See you when you get here, .

738
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:50,730
這裏一定有很多人
The guest of honor with one million followers is...

739
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:52,230
是這沒錯吧
Uh, here?

740
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:57,540
有人嗎
Hello?

741
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:01,140
凱文或者其他人
Kevin? Other guy?

742
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:22,260
今天下午我們應該再好好把文件再複查一遍
I think we should look over the files again, this afternoon.

743
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,560
確保我們沒有遺落什麼
Make sure we didn't miss anything.

744
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,770
遵命
Sure thing.

745
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:32,740
一切安排聽從組織
And per your orders, I'll check on Jaime and gar.

746
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:35,740
你不必這樣做 但謝謝
You don't have to do that, but thanks.

747
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:37,410
還有
By the way...

748
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:43,210
我想我搞不定這個
The warlords of Okaara didn't teach me much about cooking.

749
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,120
看來要定外賣了
I think you should pick something up on the way back.

750
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:46,110


751
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,620
回見
See you soon, babe.

752
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:22,920
怎麼了
What's going on?

753
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,220
早應該開門了
Not sure. It should be open.

754
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,590
也許他忘了
We got a new guy.

755
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,400
傑米
Jaime?

756
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:46,740
傑米
Jaime?

757
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,950
泰坦藍甲蟲被抓走了
Titans, Blue Beetle has been taken.

758
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:25,250
在塔上集合
Gather at the tower.

759
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,250
這裏是柯莉和迪克 我們不在家
This is Kori and dick. We're not home now.

760
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,920
請留言
So leave a message.

761
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:36,130
星火接電話 我要去接野獸小子
Starfire, pick up if you're there. I'm going to get Beast Boy.

762
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:38,060
在塔樓匯合
Get to the tower now.

763
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,760
不是吧
Oh, come on, gar.

764
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:15,930
柯莉 你在嗎
Kori, you here?

765
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:24,070
柯莉
Kori.

766
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:31,480
喪鐘已敲響
Bad day, Nightwing?

767
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,220
末日來臨
It's about to get worse.

768
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,890
你對其他人做了什麼
What have you done with Kori and the others?

769
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,090
別擔心
Don't fret.

770
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:41,020
你馬上就回和他們見面了
I'm here to take you to them.

771
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:45,660
混蛋 休想
Bring it, asshole.

772
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:54,070
就這麼點
Akido needs work.

773
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:55,740
你就這麼點水平
Your spacing's for shit.

774
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,750
你太嫩了
You're overrated, kid.

775
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:12,490
該死
Damn it.

776
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,530
夠了
Enough.

777
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:51,860
該結束了
Screw this.

778
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:07,780
格雷森 你逃了又如何
You could have died by the Blade with honor, Grayson.

779
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,150
手下敗將
Loser.

780
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:16,750
任務完成了嗎
Is it done?

781
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,160
是 搞定了
Yeah, we're good.

782
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,330
他在騙你
He's lying to you.

783
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:30,160
所有的都是謊言
About everything.

784
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,560
他以此為生
He had you pegged from the start.

785
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:34,700
他為了達到目的
That's how he does it.

786
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,570
不惜手段
Mixing truth with lies.

787
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:38,470
你就繼續扯吧
You're so freaking annoying.

788
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:40,300
你知道什麼
You don't know anything about him.

789
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,110
他救了我的命
He saved me.

790
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:45,640
讓我猜猜 他讓你只
Let me guess, he kept you isolated.

791
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,210
依賴他
Dependent.

792
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:49,680
敵視所有人
Told you everyone was your enemy.

793
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,520
然後訓練你
Trained you, ruthlessly.

794
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,320
向你許下承諾
And promised you exactly what you wanted.

795
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:59,620
我知道他所有的套路
Believe me, I know.

796
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:09,070
我一直很討厭你
I've always hated you.

797
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:11,540
還有其他人
You and all the others.

798
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:14,400
泰坦對待你像家人
The Titans treated you like family.

799
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,840
而你卻背叛了我們
And you threw it all away.

800
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:20,740
閉嘴
Stop...

801
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:25,820
你先離開一會
Can't I leave you for two minutes?

802
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:31,660
我明白你為什麼要殺了他了
I can see why you want him dead.

803
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:54,010
怎麼了
What's wrong?

804
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:56,950
再過幾個小時 我們就離開這裏
In a few hours, we're gone.

805
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:58,720
任務完成了
It's as good as done.

806
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:00,950
很高興終於結束了
Just glad this is over.

807
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,820
你已經臥底了一年了
You've been in deep cover for a year.

808
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:10,330
對他們有感情是完全正常的
It's perfectly normal to have feelings for them.

809
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:12,760
以後就只有我們兩個了
But after this we can be together.

810
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:14,330
這不正是你所希望的嗎
Just like you wanted.

811
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:16,870
別讓他影響你
Concentrate on that.

812
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:44,900
電腦 跟蹤泰拉馬爾可夫的手機
Computer, track Terra Markov's phone.

813
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,130
已發現 主體正在移動
Discovered, subject is moving.

814
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,300
我想也是
I'll bet she is.

815
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,770
兄弟姐妹 我一再強調
Brothers and sisters, I have spoken many times

816
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:57,710
所謂的神
about false gods.

817
01:01:57,710 --> 01:02:02,250
只不過是
These so-called heroes with no allegiance to our cause,

818
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:06,350
那些所謂的超級英雄
are nothing but secular idols and must be ended.

819
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:12,190
世間 只有我才是真正的神
This is the true house of faith and I am the one true god.

820
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:16,290
血兄弟萬歲 萬歲
Hail brother blood. Hail, hail!

821
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:20,100
現在聖光
Today, I am claiming their powers for us all.

822
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:23,870
已降臨到我們身上
For we are the seeds of the next generation.

823
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:26,770
我們蜂巢的身上
We are the hive of humanity.

824
01:02:26,770 --> 01:02:29,570
再也不會有人來阻止
And nothing will stand in our way.

825
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,640
我降下聖光
Raise me this holy day.

826
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,840
我們將主宰世界
The day of blood.

827
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:36,110
兄弟血會萬歲 萬歲
Hail brother blood. Hail...

828
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,420
這個地方讓我毛骨悚然
Place gives me the creeps.

829
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:39,780
我聽到了
I hear you.

830
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:46,490
夥計們 渡鴉有點不對勁
Huh? Guys, Raven's not moving.

831
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:49,790
這裏有東西抑制了我的能力
Something's keeping me from using my powers to morph.

832
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,900
是的 機器就是這麼設計的
Yeah, the machine's doing that.

833
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,960
是我把你們放了進去
But, I'm the one who put you here.

834
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,300
喪鐘
Deathstroke.

835
01:02:58,070 --> 01:02:59,500
你對羅賓做了什麼
What have you done to Robin?

836
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:02,410
他嘴巴太臭了
I beat the crap out of him for being mouthy.

837
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:06,580
你們也想試試嗎
Come on, you've all had the urge.

838
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:10,110
一旦我出來 我會揍你一頓
Once I get out, I'm gonna break you into little bits.

839
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,120
有理想
It's good to have goals, ese.

840
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:17,020
在你們死後我會好好的享受會的
Me, I'm having waffles, after you're dead.

841
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:22,730
順便 向你們介紹一下我的助手
By the way, can I introduce you to my assistant?

842
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:24,290
我想你們已經見過了
I think you've met.

843
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,130
隊友們 你們好啊
Hey, team, how's things?

844
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:31,970
泰拉 他對你做了什麼
Terra, what did he do to you?

845
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:35,310
沒什麼我已經問了很多次
Nothing. And I've asked a bunch of times.

846
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:38,340
泰拉是我安插在你們隊伍裏
Terra was a key part of my plan.

847
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:40,340
的間諜
A natural double agent.

848
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:41,980
這不可能是真的
That can't be true.

849
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,010
就像我說的
What can I tell you, Goldilocks.

850
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,280
有得必有失去
You win some, you lose some.

851
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:47,350
我們視你為隊友
We took you in.

852
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:48,620
誠心誠意幫助你
Helped you.

853
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:50,450
那就謝謝了
Yeah, well, thanks.

854
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,020
你們就等死吧
Now you're gonna die.

855
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,960
我還真有點不忍心啊
Geez, not a lot of gray area there, huh.

856
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:04,030
泰拉
Terra...

857
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:45,080
這地方讓我想起了我父母的教會
Place reminds me of my parents' church.

858
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,580
一堆瘋子
Bunch of crazies.

859
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:48,080
不知天高地厚的螻蟻
Insolent trash.

860
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,180
你管誰叫螻蟻
Who you calling trash?

861
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,380
冷靜
Keep it together.

862
01:04:54,350 --> 01:04:57,950
對我們的客人禮貌點
Let's be civil to our guests.

863
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,920
契約還沒有完成
Our business is not yet complete.

864
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:02,930
沒有完成
Sure it is.

865
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:05,860
你想要泰坦 我把他們帶來
You wanted the Titans, and here they are.

866
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,700
不是全部
Not all of them.

867
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:09,770
少了夜翼
Not Nightwing.

868
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:12,540
這破壞了機器的平衡
It ruins the machine's symmetry.

869
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:15,840
死亡是不可避免的
We agreed some deaths might be unavoidable.

870
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,040
你要明白
Things happen.

871
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,740
我知道
I accept that.

872
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:22,250
而我也告訴過你
But I told you even in death there is life to be drawn.

873
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:25,950
屍體同樣有用
Where is the body? Unless you have a body, you're one short.

874
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:31,660
所以我們的合同還不完整
Therefore, our contract is not complete.

875
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:36,330
幸運的是 我們還有備胎
Happily there is still a path to the salvation of our deal.

876
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:37,530
不是嗎
Don't you agree?

877
01:05:41,830 --> 01:05:43,330
很好
Excellent.

878
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:44,570
動手
Mayhem.

879
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:50,540
泰拉
Terra!

880
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:03,620
我要索要更多的報酬
I should have charged more.

881
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:06,290
有了她的力量 你猶如虎添翼
With her powers, you're getting an upgrade.

882
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:15,900
阿門
Amen.

883
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:19,170
現在 我們的契約已經完成
Now, our business is complete.

884
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:27,010
斯萊德 救我
Slade, help me.

885
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:35,020
對不起 孩子 生意就是生意
Sorry, kid. But a contract is a contract.

886
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:37,320
你會付出代價
You'll pay for this.

887
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:40,060
哦 甜心我也捨不得你
Oh, it's a shame you have to go, sweet cheeks.

888
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:42,460
我們相愛彼此
We would have been fantastic lovers.

889
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:45,360
我們對彼此一見鍾情
You know, since we're both newly single.

890
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:56,340
開始
Let it begin!

891
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:26,740
你認為你是神嗎 血兄弟
You think yourself a holy man, blood?

892
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:28,000
你只是個小人
You're filth.

893
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:29,840
緘口 罪人
Take heart, sinner.

894
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:33,340
你們將名垂青史
You are about to become part of the greater good.

895
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:35,810
要我們教你怎麼成名嗎
We're gonna show you the greater good.

896
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:37,750
就是踢你的屁股
By kicking your ass.

897
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:48,390
喪鐘 上帝不會饒恕你的
No god is going to save you, Deathstroke.

898
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:52,300
血兄弟
Word to the wise, blood,

899
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:55,270
你要對他們做什麼 快點做
whatever you're gonna do to them, do it quickly.

900
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:19,860
感覺不舒服
Not feeling so good.

901
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:24,460
他們罪有應得
I consider their pain a retribution for their sins against me.

902
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:26,360
對
Right.

903
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,630
你高興就好
Have a nice day.

904
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:34,340
先別急著走 等這個環節過了再說
Oh, don't leave now, brother. Everyone stays for this part.

905
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:37,340
什麼環節 血兄弟
What part is that, brother?

906
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:45,010
當他們的力量助我成神時
When their powers are transferred and I ascend to god state.

907
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:51,350
血弟兄們 聖光即將降臨
Hail me, brethren, for the moment of ascendency has arrived.

908
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:54,520
萬歲 血兄弟 萬歲 萬歲
Hail, brother blood. Hail, hail.

909
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:57,790
萬歲 萬歲萬歲
Hail, brother blood. Hail, hail.

910
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,400
兄弟血會萬歲 萬歲
Hail, brother blood. Hail...

911
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:04,900
沒錯我的子民們  你們將見證我...
Yes, my children, this vessel shall now transform me...

912
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:08,640
成神之...
And you are witness.

913
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:11,170
血兄弟 萬歲 萬歲 萬歲
Hail, brother blood. Hail, hail.

914
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,610
我感到
I feel it.

915
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:17,150
爽
Yes!

916
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:20,920
我即將成神
My godhood is nearly complete.

917
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,250
讚美他
Praise him.

918
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:27,020
血兄弟萬歲
All hail brother blood.

919
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:28,730
萬歲 萬歲
Hail, hail.

920
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,370
爽....
Yes...

921
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:22,710
我知道你會來的
I knew you'd come.

922
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:59,680
嗨 老大爺 這是你的
Hey, papa, here's your pipe.

923
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:08,390
不要感謝我
Save some for me.

924
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:08,340
你們就不明白我是天命之子嗎
Don't you know, I am the chosen?

925
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:11,980
你們不知道 我是神...
Don't you know, I am divine...

926
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:26,430
我會殺了你
I'm gonna kill you.

927
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:35,040
你在利用我 不是嗎
I was being studied, like all the rest, wasn't I?

928
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:38,110
你從一開始就計劃這個權利
You planned this right from the start.

929
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:39,480
冷靜下來
Calm down.

930
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:42,080
我的愛 不是你想的這樣
This is all a big misunderstanding, love.

931
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,510
泰拉 不
Terra, no.

932
01:13:57,490 --> 01:13:59,100
哦哦 該死
Oh, shit.

933
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:05,540
你這個異教徒
You heathen brats.

934
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:08,040
你毀了我的聖殿
You've destroyed my holy temple.

935
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:16,980
你奪走了我的神力
You've robbed me of my destiny.

936
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:18,610
我要殺了你
You will die.

937
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:23,120
你不會傷害...
You cannot harm...

938
01:14:32,530 --> 01:14:35,830
不 滾開
No, you stay away from me.

939
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,330
你們這些惡魔
You demon filth.

940
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:39,770
他們不是惡魔
They're not demons.

941
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:41,200
我才是
Let me show you one.

942
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:49,080
什麼鬼
What the hell?

943
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,310
我準備了這麼久
I planned so long.

944
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:29,090
我是神 你們不明白嗎
I was destined, can't you see?

945
01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:32,120
我懇求你
Please, I beseech you.

946
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:34,960
以血兄弟的名義
I am blood.

947
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,160
我...
I...

948
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,200
我是...
I am...

949
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:45,740
原諒我
Saved.

950
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:49,910
我不會讓他們抓住你的 我的愛
I won't let them cage you, my love.

951
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:52,280
快走
Come on.

952
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,190
孩子 再見
So long, kid.

953
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:57,310
泰拉..
Terra...

954
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:01,280
對不起
I'm sorry.

955
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:04,610
不 泰拉...
No, Terra...

956
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:29,640
- 不要... - 我們必須離開這裏
- No... -We have to go. The place is gonna collapse.

957
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:30,970
泰拉
Terra!

958
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:56,300
可以問你個問題嗎 你怎麼會成為一個泰坦呢
So, let me ask you this, man, how do you become a titan exactly?

959
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:59,270
我的意思是 有沒有試鏡什麼的
I mean, is there an audition? Do you look at videos?

960
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:01,940
我能不能成為一個泰坦
'Cause I've been working out, you know, I want in.

961
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:05,210
凱文 對我泰坦們泰坦來說
Well, Kev, I guess the most important thing to being a titan,

962
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:07,840
家庭最重要
is to have a strong sense of family.

963
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:14,420
有時我們也會因為性格不合
Some of us don't have our own, so, we support the ones that do.

964
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:40,410
而傷害彼此
Of course, an outgoing personality does hurt but, you know,

965
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:41,640
但你有超能力誒
you gotta have a power.

966
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,610
是挺帥的
Something cool.

967
01:18:43,610 --> 01:18:47,250
帥 夥計你可以變身為動物 這也太酷炫了
Something cool? Listen, you turn into animals, man, that's beyond cool.

968
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:47,250
謝謝
Thanks.

969
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:50,920
這個能力不是來耍酷的
But, it's not just about the cool super powers,

970
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:53,820
穿上制服我們不能為所欲為
snazzy uniforms and daring adventures.

971
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:56,990
它使我們變得
It's about us helping each other grow.

972
01:18:56,990 --> 01:18:58,790
更好
Be better people.

973
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:10,710
我知道你不想談論隊伍裏的人 但我還是忍不住
Listen, I know you're not supposed to talk about this, but I just gotta ask.

974
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:13,140
想問問那個女孩
There's a new girl, right?

975
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:16,780
她對我們來說意義非凡
All I can say is that she's a wonderful addition to the team.

976
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:20,120
繼續說 星火會殺了我的
- Come on, gar... - Starfire would kill me.

977
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:23,920
這事就你知我知
There's no way Starfire is listening to this, man, she's brushing her hair.

978
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:30,690
不要 沒門
Forget it. My lips are sealed.

979
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:34,060
他變成了只海豹
Whoa, man, he just turned into a seal, folks, I swear.

980
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:37,370
但是 加爾 她代替了土石女的位置嗎
But really, gar, is she gonna, like, replace Terra?

981
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,570
泰拉
Terra?

982
01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:42,470
是的 你應該知道很多關於她的故事
Yeah, you know, there are lots of stories about her.

983
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:44,140
我知道
I know.

984
01:19:45,310 --> 01:19:46,780
哦 太好了
Ooh, too soon?

985
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:49,750
是啊
Yeah.

986
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:51,280
我不是這個意思 如果你不想...
I mean, that's cool honestly, if you don't wanna...

987
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:53,780
但是 我想說..
But, I'd like to say something...

988
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:56,950
很多人幻想過一個完美的人生
There are a lot of people who've been handed a rough life.

989
01:19:57,790 --> 01:19:59,390
他們沒有什麼需求 但...
They never asked for it, but...

990
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:01,560
他們盡其所能
They do what they can.

991
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:06,000
他們害怕被傷害
Many of them can't rise above the hurt.

992
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,400
但這太難了
It's just too hard.

993
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:12,870
但是最後 一切轟然倒塌時
But in the end, when the chips were down,

994
01:20:14,470 --> 01:20:17,240
她找到了自我
and she finally showed her true self,

995
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:22,240
泰拉馬科夫是我見過的
Terra Markov was like a diamond.

996
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:08,090
後續彩蛋 勿走開

997
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:25,150
最偉大的人
Most beautiful thing that I'd ever seen.

998
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:52,090
就如我所說
I talk to the dead.

999
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:54,090
死亡不是終結
For no matter how rotted the corpse,

1000
01:23:54,090 --> 01:23:57,630
一切才剛剛開始
there's always a tiny wisp of life left.
