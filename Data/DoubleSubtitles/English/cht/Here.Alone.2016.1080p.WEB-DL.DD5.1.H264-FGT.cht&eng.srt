{\fs14}How to make a deadfall trap, you need a support stick, a weight stick, a bait stick. Okay?

50
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:37,021

53
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:46,297

{\fs14}Okay.

54
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,004

紅葉
{\fs14}Red leaves.

58
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,117

59
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,354
尤其是在春天
{\fs14}Especially during the spring.

60
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,863
你扣扳機太用力了
{\fs14}You're jerking the trigger.

61
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:19,998
我擊中了
{\fs14}And I hit it!

62
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
那是因為它沒動
{\fs14}That's 'cause it's not moving.

63
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:24,569
這是把獵槍所以想打死就得打頭或者心臟
{\fs14}It's a rabbit gun, you need to hit head or heart to kill

64
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:27,238
所以我要你控制呼吸輕輕地
{\fs14}so I need you to control your breathing and lightly--

65
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,440
扣扳機 別太用力 我知道
{\fs14}squeeze, not pull, I know.

66
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:32,110
我們得節省子彈
{\fs14}We should save our bullets.

67
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:36,147
你不會打槍再省也白搭
{\fs14}Well, they're of no use if you don't know how to shoot.

68
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,082
還剩多少
{\fs14}How many do we have?

夠多了
{\fs14}Enough.

00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,487
再來
{\fs14}Do it again.

71
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:06,477
光靠野果子我們撐不住的
{\fs14}We can't survive on a handful of berries.

72
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:10,381
我知道
{\fs14}I know.

00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:56,274
你好啊
{\fs14}Hi there, how are you?

86
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,678
可惡
{\fs14}Damn it!

87
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:40,431
操
{\fs14}Fuck!

88
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:32,783

{\fs14}No, don't touch me!

90
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:36,554
把東西裝車上去
{\fs14}Just get everything in the car.

91
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:38,022
怎麼了
{\fs14}What happened?

92
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,524
快他媽上車
{\fs14}Just get in the fucking car!

93
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,003
她退燒了嗎
{\fs14}Her fever break?

94
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:54,138
沒有
{\fs14}No.

95
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,539
傑森 怎麼了
{\fs14}Jason, what happened?

96
00:22:57,477 --> 00:22:59,477
那裏有幾箱子吃的
{\fs14}There were a few boxes of food.

97
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:01,479
但他們也在那裏
{\fs14}But they were there.

98
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:02,413
是
{\fs14}Yeah.

99
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,416
他們也在
{\fs14}They were there.

100
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:07,685
你避開過他們
{\fs14}But you've avoided them before.

101
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:08,919
這次為什麼突然進攻了
{\fs14}Why did they attack this time?

102
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,087
我不知道
{\fs14}I don't know.

103
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,021
不知道
{\fs14}I don't.

104
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:16,994
那裏有足夠的食物 足夠的屍體給他們吃
{\fs14}There was enough food to eat there, there was enough bodies.

105
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,767
我以為他們吃完就會走
{\fs14}I thought they would've moved on.

106
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,738
本來都好好的 直到我破開房門的時候
{\fs14}Everything was fine until i cut myself breaking

107
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,073
割傷了自己
{\fs14}into that house.

108
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:33,611
血流了出來 嚎叫聲就起來了
{\fs14}The blood started flowing and screams grew

109
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,415
他們就涌過來了
{\fs14}and they swarmed.

110
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,555
就好像他們知道
{\fs14}It was like they knew.

111
00:23:44,557 --> 00:23:46,690
他們知道我在流血
{\fs14}They knew I was bleeding.

112
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,661
他們能感覺到
{\fs14}They could sense it.

113
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,130
他們是什麼束西
{\fs14}What are they?

114
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,735
我不知道
{\fs14}I don't know.

115
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,008
但他們和人還有一個共同點
{\fs14}But some part of them is human.

116
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,810
怎麼說
{\fs14}Why is that?

117
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,114
因為他們會死
{\fs14}Because they can die.

118
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:29,693
拜託 拜託

133
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,007

134
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,960

00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:28,072
克裏斯和我媽媽在一起了 但...
{\fs14}Chris and my mom were, you know, together, but

139
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,075
他們沒有結婚
{\fs14}they never married.

140
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,746
他們本來計劃九月結的 但是…
{\fs14}They planned it for September, but...

141
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:47,858
你要是想睡車裏也可以
{\fs14}You can sleep in the car if you want.

142
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,926
沒關係的
{\fs14}No, it's fine.

143
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:51,061
我想睡在他旁邊
{\fs14}I want to sleep near him.

144
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:58,802
我們會離開的 等他好一點之後
{\fs14}We'll leave, when he's better, I mean.

145
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,439
我們不會賴著你的
{\fs14}We'll leave you alone.

146
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,944
你們為什麼有兩個營地
{\fs14}Why do you have two campsites?

147
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:16,980
以防我失去一個
{\fs14}In case I lose one or the other.

148
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:17,915
哦
{\fs14}Oh.

149
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:12,202
這些有助於掩蓋氣味 把那些扔了
{\fs14}Helps cover your scent, throws them off.

150
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:08,225
你們要去北邊
{\fs14}You headed north?

151
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:10,928
是的
{\fs14}Yeah.

152
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:15,399
你想聽嗎
{\fs14}You wanna hear it?

153
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,680
這就是北方的情況
{\fs14}That's what's up north?

154
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,350
是的
{\fs14}Mm-hmm.

155
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,387
你知道他們在說什麼嗎
{\fs14}Do you know what they're saying?

156
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:11,388
不知道
{\fs14}No.

157
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,263
所以就是這樣
{\fs14}So that's it.

158
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,634
那邊就是這樣
{\fs14}That's all there is.

159
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:47,157
克裏斯
{\fs14}Chris?

160
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,128
沒事 莉薇
{\fs14}It's alright, Liv.

161
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:53,797
沒事的
{\fs14}It's okay.

162
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:07,110
她說你們正向北方去
{\fs14}She says you're heading north.

163
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:10,213
是啊 好歹試一下
{\fs14}Yeah, trying to at least.

164
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,085
我們聽說那裏疫情已經被控制了
{\fs14}We hear it's in check up there.

165
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,188
誰特麼知道
{\fs14}Who the fuck knows, right?

166
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,497
你這設置的很好
{\fs14}You have a pretty nice setup here.

167
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:32,669
很多人拼了命都想擁有這些
{\fs14}Most people would kill for this stuff.

168
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:34,805
你有帳篷
{\fs14}You gotta tent.

169
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,641
食物 就我來看
{\fs14}Food, from what I can tell.

170
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:38,575
還有車
{\fs14}Car.

171
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:47,217
你的油箱是滿的嗎 -不是
{\fs14}You gotta full tank? - No.

172
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:53,690
只是個能躲雨的地方
{\fs14}Just a place to hide from the rain.

173
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,539
哦
{\fs14}Ugh.

174
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,413
謝謝
{\fs14}Thank you.

175
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,120
為了你為我倆所做的一切
{\fs14}For what you did, for both of us.

176
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:28,291
現在沒什麼人會這麼做了
{\fs14}Not a lot of people would do that nowadays.

177
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:36,566
我們明早就出發
{\fs14}We'll be gone in the morning.

178
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:37,501
好的
{\fs14}Okay.

179
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,706
起來了孩子 出發了
{\fs14}Get up, kiddo, let's go.

180
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:44,641
進帳篷裏去
{\fs14}Let's get in the tent.

181
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:28,585
快點進去
{\fs14}Come on, get in!

182
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,918
所以你們在外面呆多久了
{\fs14}So, how long you been out here?

183
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,621
自爆發開始的時候
{\fs14}Since it started.

184
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:07,991
嗯
{\fs14}Hmm.

185
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:14,631
你為什麼要來這人煙稀少的地方
{\fs14}Why you all the way out here in the middle of nowhere?

186
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:21,371
我丈夫自小在這樹林裏長大的
{\fs14}My husband grew up in these woods.

187
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:24,507
他住在從這往西一公里多的小鎮上
{\fs14}He lived in a town a mile or two west.

188
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:26,509
他把我們帶來這裏
{\fs14}He brought us out here.

189
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,946
他覺得這裏最安全
{\fs14}It's where he felt safest.

190
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:36,353
是他教你如何成為林中高手的嗎
{\fs14}Is that who taught you how to be woods woman-y?

191
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:43,326
他將畢生所學都教給了我
{\fs14}He taught me what he could.

192
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:45,795
怎麼了
{\fs14}What?

193
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,264
行了 莉薇
{\fs14}Come on, Liv.

194
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:43,814
我們一直聽到有流言
{\fs14}We kept hearing things, you know.

195
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,955
為什麼費城一天就淪陷 而一些窮鄉僻壤
{\fs14}How Philly went down in a day but some backwater,

196
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:50,527
像貝瑟爾一個月都沒受到攻擊
{\fs14}berg like bethel didn't get hit for a month.

197
00:38:50,529 --> 00:38:54,431
所以莉薇的母親蘇珊娜說"我們等著"
{\fs14}So Suzanne, Liv's mom, she said, "let's wait."

198
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,968
就他媽等著
{\fs14}Let's just fucking wait.

199
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:03,873
她甚至還覺得紅十字會
{\fs14}She even thought that the red cross was handing out

200
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,609
在急著去發放解藥
{\fs14}the cure in bottles over in trout run.

201
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:10,013
結果發現他們只發了熱巧克力
{\fs14}Turns out they were just handing out hot chocolate

202
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,948
和芝士三明治
{\fs14}and cheese sandwiches.

203
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:18,555
沒過多久蘇珊腹部出現小傷口
{\fs14}And then Suzy got some sores on her belly,

204
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:24,361
就像一個個小圓圈
{\fs14}they just looked like little circles.

205
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:25,095
你知道嗎
{\fs14}You know?

206
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:27,964
小跳蚤咬的
{\fs14}Little flea bites.

207
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:34,637
但情況開始惡化了
{\fs14}And then they started getting worse.

208
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:39,709
傷口開始流血化膿
{\fs14}Started bleeding and giving off some sort of white puss.

209
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:43,747
兩天之後 她攻擊了莉薇
{\fs14}Two days later, she, she attacked Liv.

210
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:55,492
她試圖徒手撕開她
{\fs14}She tried to rip her apart with her bare hands.

211
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:03,133
也就是那個時候我把她綁在床上
{\fs14}So that's when I tied her to the bed.

212
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:08,505
她就只會吼叫
{\fs14}And all she did was scream.

213
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,780
我們把她在那綁了幾天
{\fs14}We left her there for a few days.

214
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,787
就只是聽她一直叫
{\fs14}Just listening to her scream.

215
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,727
你就不管她了
{\fs14}You just left her?

216
00:40:30,729 --> 00:40:32,061
綁在床上
{\fs14}Tied to the bed?

217
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:43,506
某種程度上
{\fs14}In a way,

218
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:47,010
是的
{\fs14}yeah.

219
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,050
我從廚房拿了把刀
{\fs14}I took a kitchen knife and,

220
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,888
從她耳朵紮了進去
{\fs14}shoved it in her ear.

221
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:03,960
我一直推一直推
{\fs14}And I kept on pushing and pushing.

222
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,231
直到她不再吼叫
{\fs14}Until the screams stopped.

223
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:21,077
我覺得她會原諒我
{\fs14}I like to think that she forgave me, though.

224
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:25,148
她聽到我說對不起了而且信以為真
{\fs14}That she heard me say I'm sorry and believed it.

225
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,880
我的天哪 不要
{\fs14}Oh, my god, oh my god, no!

226
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:31,748
快跳下去
{\fs14}Come on, you're going in!

227
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:32,682
我們走
{\fs14}Here we go!

228
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:33,650
洗澡時間到
{\fs14}Bath time.

229
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:40,256
怎麼了 我還沒把你扔進去呢 我的天
{\fs14}What, I didn't even throw you in. Oh my god.

230
00:42:40,258 --> 00:42:42,892
這水都沒有那麼涼
{\fs14}These waters aren't even that cold.

231
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:46,095
-天哪 -看多棒
{\fs14}- Oh man. - See, it's nice.

232
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:48,298
看起來真糟糕
{\fs14}It looks awful.

233
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,668
我不放心你在我身後 你走遠點
{\fs14}I don't trust you behind me, get out of here.

234
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,336
我可以推你一把
{\fs14}Well, I can push you.

235
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:07,884
老天 這裏有魚嗎
{\fs14}God, are there even any fish here?

236
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:10,053
湖邊都這樣 莉薇
{\fs14}Law of the lake, Liv.

237
00:43:10,055 --> 00:43:13,923
有漁夫的地方就沒有魚了
{\fs14}Where there are fishermen, there are no fish.

238
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,694
對 但這是河啊
{\fs14}Yeah, but we're on a river.

239
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:21,130
一樣的道理
{\fs14}Rules still apply.

240
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,868
我和馬特·泰爾一起捕過魚
{\fs14}I went on this fishing trip once with Matt theil.

241
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,870
你還記得馬特嗎 莉薇
{\fs14}You remember Matt, Liv?

242
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,942
壯的像頭牛的那個
{\fs14}Guy was built like a fucking tank.

243
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:36,813
他能用牙齒起開啤酒瓶
{\fs14}He could open bottles of beer with his teeth.

244
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,016
整天宅著玩《使命召喚》
{\fs14}Use to play call of duty 24/7.

245
00:43:40,018 --> 00:43:42,752
反正 有一次馬特租了條船
{\fs14}Anyway, Matt rented a boat one time, well, it wasn't really

246
00:43:42,754 --> 00:43:44,654
好吧也稱不上是船 頂多就是艘小破艇
{\fs14}a boat, it was more of a skiff.

247
00:43:44,656 --> 00:43:47,757
小到甚至都包不住裏面的燈光
{\fs14}Tiny one at that, couldn't even fit a case of fucking natty light in it.

248
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:48,691
別說了
{\fs14}Stop.

249
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:51,995
你說哈
{\fs14}What?

250
00:43:51,997 --> 00:43:54,897
別說了
{\fs14}Just stop.

251
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:58,167
行吧
{\fs14}Okay.

252
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:20,023
前面在河邊你幹嘛不讓我說話了
{\fs14}Hey, why did you stop me earlier at the river?

253
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,829
我就是覺得有的時候
{\fs14}You know sometimes you,

254
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:30,299
你好像忘了現實是什麼慘樣
{\fs14}it feels like you forget what's out there.

255
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:33,670
反正就是前一秒你還在說
{\fs14}I don't know, one minute you're telling me about

256
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:36,139
你怎麼把你老婆殺了
{\fs14}how you killed your wife.

257
00:44:36,141 --> 00:44:38,708
下一秒你就讓我覺得
{\fs14}And the next, it's just like,

258
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:42,378
我們好像只是外出野營
{\fs14}we're on a weekend camping trip.

259
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,848
過了週末一切就恢復正常
{\fs14}We'll all return to normalcy on Monday.

260
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,452
你老婆身上長的那些小傷口
{\fs14}You know those rings your wife had?

261
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:56,259
我早在之前就已經見識過了
{\fs14}We saw them before anyone knew what was going on.

262
00:44:57,327 --> 00:45:01,464
我們給急診室的病人們擠膿血
{\fs14}We get patients in the er oozing puss and blood.

263
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:07,437
傷口就在不斷腐化周圍的皮膚
{\fs14}The rings just devouring the skin around it.

264
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:13,209
不斷地寄生擴散腐爛
{\fs14}Feeding on it like it knew what it was gonna become.

265
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:20,883
他們還能躺在床士的唯一原因
{\fs14}The only thing keeping them down there

266
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:24,921
就是傷口還沒有完全吞噬遍佈整個身子
{\fs14}is the fact that they haven't eaten all the bodies yet.

267
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:27,857
所有像你老婆那樣被感染的人
{\fs14}You know, all those people like your wife,

268
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:30,326
只能被綁在床上沒人再管
{\fs14}just left and tied to the bed.

269
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:34,030
我做不到
{\fs14}I can't.

270
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:38,835
我沒辦法忘記這些畫面
{\fs14}I can't just choose to forget that.

271
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,275
我沒有忘記
{\fs14}I didn't forget.

272
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:52,482
我只是挑了好的回憶然後適時地去回想
{\fs14}I just choose what to remember and when to remember it.

273
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:06,896
去睡覺吧
{\fs14}Get some sleep, alright?

274
00:46:13,037 --> 00:46:15,471
已經被掃蕩過了 我只能找到這麼點
{\fs14}They took two houses before I found the last amount.

275
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:22,011
得想辦法讓海莉退燒
{\fs14}Hailey needs something to bring her fever down.

276
00:46:22,013 --> 00:46:23,412
我們還得要食物
{\fs14}And we need food.

277
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:26,916
你不能就這麼走
{\fs14}You can't just quit.

278
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:34,290
你把我們救了出來 傑森
{\fs14}You brought us out here for a reason, Jason.

279
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:38,928
你可以選擇不救
{\fs14}This was your call.

280
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,297
我們得救了
{\fs14}And we survived.

281
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:45,168
我們活下來了
{\fs14}We've gotten by.

282
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:48,971
得過且過可不算
{\fs14}Getting by isn't life.

283
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:54,177
可我們現在只能得過且過了
{\fs14}Getting by is all we have left.

284
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:03,119
你得走了
{\fs14}You need to go.

285
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,394
嗯
{\fs14}Yeah.

286
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:20,603
泥巴有用嗎
{\fs14}Will this mud work?

287
00:47:20,605 --> 00:47:23,005
不知道
{\fs14}I don't know.

288
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:25,341
應該能擋掉點氣味
{\fs14}Should mask the scent.

289
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:26,909
好
{\fs14}Right.

290
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:27,577
天啊
{\fs14}Gosh.

291
00:47:29,214 --> 00:47:30,146
對不起
{\fs14}I'm sorry.

292
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:37,987
嘿 嘿
{\fs14}Hey, hey.

293
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:40,189
我們絕不只是得過且過
{\fs14}We're not just getting by.

294
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:45,361
我們還不到那麼絕望
{\fs14}We have more left than you think.

295
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:49,298
好
{\fs14}Okay.

296
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:33,636
你看到她了嗎
{\fs14}You seen her?

297
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:34,570
沒
{\fs14}Nah-uh.

298
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,712
我們什麼時候走
{\fs14}When are we leaving?

299
00:49:42,714 --> 00:49:43,646
過會兒
{\fs14}Soon.

300
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,652
你總是說我們要不斷前進
{\fs14}You always say we have to keep moving.

301
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:51,454
停下來的人只有死
{\fs14}Those who stay, die.

302
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:55,458
我們會走的 只是再等一會
{\fs14}We'll keep going, just not yet.

303
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,528
怎麼我們留在這是因為她
{\fs14}So what, we're staying because of her?

304
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,430
不是 我們留在這是因為她能弄到食物
{\fs14}No, we're staying because she has access to food

305
00:50:01,432 --> 00:50:02,365
和水
{\fs14}and water.

306
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:07,103
我們該感恩了 麗薇
{\fs14}We should be thankful, Liv.

307
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:11,173
為什麼我們離開會有影響
{\fs14}Why does it matter if we're leaving anyway?

308
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:13,275
確實有影響
{\fs14}Well, it does matter.

309
00:50:13,277 --> 00:50:14,610
這是她應得的
{\fs14}She deserves it.

310
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,047
-天知道她經歷了些什麼 -是 但我們也經歷了...
{\fs14}- Lord knows what she's been through. - Yeah but we've been through--

311
00:50:18,049 --> 00:50:22,385
是的 我們也一路坎坷 麗薇
{\fs14}we'll, we've all been through shit, Liv.

312
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:27,156
但至少我們有彼此
{\fs14}But at least you and i had each other.

313
00:50:27,158 --> 00:50:29,225
她孤苦伶仃
{\fs14}She didn't have anybody.

314
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:52,548
媽的
{\fs14}Shit.

315
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,350
給你
{\fs14}Here.

316
00:50:54,352 --> 00:50:55,156
沒事 沒事 我看看
{\fs14}I'm fine, I'm fine. Let me see.

317
00:50:55,181 --> 00:50:56,619
不用了
{\fs14}No, it's fine.

318
00:50:56,621 --> 00:50:58,354
讓我看看
{\fs14}Let me see.

319
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:10,533
你為什麼還戴著這個
{\fs14}Why do you still wear it?

320
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,202
大概是習慣了
{\fs14}Habit, I guess.

321
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,286
我以前很喜歡看這個節目
{\fs14}I use to love that show.

322
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:35,724
我女兒喜歡彩色的
{\fs14}My daughter loved the colorful ones.

323
00:51:35,726 --> 00:51:39,128
他們怎麼了
{\fs14}What happened to them?

324
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:40,729
我是說你的家人
{\fs14}Your family, I mean.

325
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:45,501
和大家的遭遇一樣
{\fs14}Same thing that happened to everyone elses.

326
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,394
你在分配食物
{\fs14}You're rationing.

327
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:46,328
是的
{\fs14}Yeah.

328
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,632
路上總是找不到吃的
{\fs14}Can't always find food on the road.

329
00:52:49,634 --> 00:52:50,766
你要走了
{\fs14}You're leaving, then.

330
00:52:50,768 --> 00:52:51,901
是的 馬上
{\fs14}Yeah, soon.

331
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:55,771
你可以多拿一點 如果…
{\fs14}You can take more if--

332
00:52:55,773 --> 00:52:57,573
不用了 真的不用了
{\fs14}nah, nah, please.

333
00:52:57,575 --> 00:53:00,276
我們帶走的食物越多 就越需要你到那裏去搞食物
{\fs14}The more food we take, the more you have to go down there and get some.

334
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:06,615
要不你和我們一起走吧
{\fs14}Hey, why don't you come with us?

335
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:08,417
為什麼不
{\fs14}Why not?

336
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:13,255
你怎麼知道離開這裏會比留在這兒好
{\fs14}How do you know if what's out there is any better than what's here?

337
00:53:13,257 --> 00:53:18,194
確實不知道 但是這個地方是能當暫時的避難天堂
{\fs14}Yes we don't really. But, I mean, this place can only be paradise for so long.

338
00:53:18,196 --> 00:53:19,929
這裏並不是天堂
{\fs14}It's not a paradise.

339
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:27,670
你有麗薇了 所以你得找個地方生存下來
{\fs14}You've got Liv so you need to find a place to survive.

340
00:53:27,672 --> 00:53:29,471
我覺得你應該向北去
{\fs14}For you, it's north.

341
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:32,341
而我應該留在這裏
{\fs14}For me, it's here.

342
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:48,784
如果我在這裏打中那顆樹你要給我什麼
{\fs14}Hey, what would you give me if I hit that tree right there?

343
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:53,322
怎麼你還是五歲小孩嗎 我十二歲 非常感謝
{\fs14}What are you, like five? I am 12, thank you very much.

344
00:54:53,324 --> 00:54:54,356
說真的你要給我什麼
{\fs14}Seriously, what are you gonna give me?

345
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:56,292
那邊的那稞樹
{\fs14}That tree right there.

346
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:58,794
呃
{\fs14}Um.

347
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,332
我給你做晚飯
{\fs14}I'll cook you dinner.

348
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,435
晚飯 有沒搞錯
{\fs14}Dinner, really?

349
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,571
每晚都是你為我們做晚飯
{\fs14}You cook us dinner every night.

350
00:55:09,573 --> 00:55:11,907
再說一句那稞樹可是在45米開外哦
{\fs14}Plus that tree's 50 yards away.

351
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:12,908
45米
{\fs14}50 yards?

352
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:14,310
最多27米
{\fs14}Uh 30, tops.

353
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:16,812
好吧 行
{\fs14}Alright, fine.

354
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:19,748
你要給我什麼
{\fs14}Still, what are you gonna give me?

355
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:27,423
好吧
{\fs14}Fine.

356
00:55:30,627 --> 00:55:31,960
我們不定量了
{\fs14}We won't ration.

357
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:34,663
天啊 你一定要打中
{\fs14}My god, you have to.

358
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:35,931
你一定要打中
{\fs14}You have to!

359
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:37,800
從這裏開始可以嗎
{\fs14}So from here, is this okay?

360
00:55:37,802 --> 00:55:40,836
是的 你必須特別准才行
{\fs14}Yeah and you have to make precisely that,

361
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:43,572
你看見那下面的洞了嗎
{\fs14}you see that little hole at the bottom there?

362
00:55:43,574 --> 00:55:44,606
中間的那個
{\fs14}The one right in the middle.

363
00:55:44,608 --> 00:55:45,541
是的
{\fs14}Yeah.

364
00:55:45,543 --> 00:55:46,875
那個
{\fs14}That.

365
00:55:46,877 --> 00:55:47,810
好吧
{\fs14}Alright.

366
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:52,348
你給我什麼
{\fs14}What are you gonna give me?

367
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,783
晚飯之類的
{\fs14}The dinner thing.

368
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:57,019
那不行 那是安的
{\fs14}You can't have that thing, that's Ann's thing.

369
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:59,555
但是我們除了四塊餅乾以外能吃 沒別的了
{\fs14}Yeah but we get to eat more than four fucking crackers.

370
00:55:59,557 --> 00:56:02,791
好吧 你給我什麼呢
{\fs14}Alright, fine then, but what are you gonna give me?

371
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:03,726
快說
{\fs14}Come on.

372
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:06,662
我們可以游泳
{\fs14}We can swim.

373
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:09,565
真的嗎
{\fs14}Really?

374
00:56:09,567 --> 00:56:10,899
真的
{\fs14}Yeah.

375
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,603
你討厭游泳的
{\fs14}You hate swimming.

376
00:56:14,605 --> 00:56:15,904
你竟然討厭游泳
{\fs14}You hate swimming?

377
00:56:15,906 --> 00:56:17,439
不喜歡在湖裏游而己
{\fs14}Just in lakes.

378
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,877
我不喜歡看不到底
{\fs14}I don't like not seeing the bottom.

379
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:22,811
好了
{\fs14}Alright.

380
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:27,516
就這個 就拿它當彈珠了
{\fs14}This right here, it's for all the marbles.

381
00:56:27,518 --> 00:56:28,650
行了 扔一個看看
{\fs14}Okay, come one.

382
00:56:28,652 --> 00:56:31,387
是大餐還是游泳
{\fs14}Big ol' dinner and swim time.

383
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:32,121
拭目以待
{\fs14}Alright? Here we go.

384
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:36,680
等等不不我手滑了
{\fs14}Oh wait, no, no, I slipped.

385
00:56:36,705 --> 00:56:37,659
不行不行 剛才是個錯誤的開始
{\fs14}Oh, nope, nope. That was a false start.

386
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:40,662
讓我再扔一次 再扔一次
{\fs14}Give me one more shot, i get a second shot.

387
00:56:40,664 --> 00:56:41,797
看著
{\fs14}Come on, now.

388
00:56:45,002 --> 00:56:49,405
天啊 有什麼束西碰我的腳了
{\fs14}Oh my god, something just touched my foot.

389
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:52,107
又碰了一下
{\fs14}Did it again.

390
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:54,877
幹嘛
{\fs14}What?

391
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:58,614
沒事
{\fs14}Nothing.

392
00:56:58,616 --> 00:57:00,749
沒什麼事
{\fs14}It's not nothing.

393
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:03,886
沒事
{\fs14}It's nothing.

394
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:09,858
就是沒事
{\fs14}Yeah, it's nothing.

395
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,567
哦喲 對不起
{\fs14}Oops, sorry.

396
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:24,006
一會兒見
{\fs14}See you later.

397
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:32,915
從沒想過我會懷念這個鬼東西
{\fs14}Mmm. Never thought I'd miss this shit.

398
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:44,860
想讓我給你做一個嗎
{\fs14}Oh, you want me to make you one?

399
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:46,662
我挺擅長的
{\fs14}I'm really good.

400
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,666
我試試
{\fs14}Let me try.

401
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:54,536
開始
{\fs14}There we go.

402
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,539
來點甜菜
{\fs14}Little beet.

403
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:00,943
來點橄欖
{\fs14}Little olive.

404
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:03,011
給你
{\fs14}There you go.

405
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,056
好吃吧
{\fs14}It's good, right?

406
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:16,492
要不要來點芝士
{\fs14}Need more cheese, though?

407
00:58:16,494 --> 00:58:18,694
給
{\fs14}Here.

408
00:58:18,696 --> 00:58:19,628
來呀
{\fs14}Come on.

409
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,200
來點芝士吧 莉薇
{\fs14}Want some cheese, Liv?

410
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:46,955
她看起來像媽媽
{\fs14}She looks like mom.

411
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:51,760
頭髮不太像
{\fs14}I mean, not the hair but.

412
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:57,132
她挺擅長野外生存的
{\fs14}She's good at this stuff, you know?

413
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:02,237
如果是我的話 我心裏也會啊的一聲
{\fs14}I mean, if it was me, i would just be like, ah!

414
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:10,846
那就是你想讓她跟我們一起走的原因嗎
{\fs14}Is that why you want her to come with us?

415
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:18,220
因為她很擅長這類事情嗎
{\fs14}I mean, 'cause she's good at this kind of thing?

416
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:23,659
如果那天她沒發現我們的話 我們會怎樣
{\fs14}Now, where would we be if she didn't find us that day?

417
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:27,696
我會死掉 你會孤身一人
{\fs14}I'd be dead and you'd be alone.

418
00:59:27,698 --> 00:59:29,565
沒有人該受這種罪
{\fs14}Nobody deserves that.

419
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:31,867
不應該是你 也不應該是她
{\fs14}Not you, not her.

420
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:40,008
我想讓她來是因為你
{\fs14}I want her to come because of you.

421
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:42,945
因為她能照顧好我們
{\fs14}Because she takes good care of us.

422
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:49,117
因為我也想照顧她
{\fs14}Because I wanna take care of her, too.

423
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,172
我能戴戴嗎
{\fs14}Can I try that on?

424
01:00:14,677 --> 01:00:15,811
可以
{\fs14}Sure.

425
01:00:24,088 --> 01:00:25,954
他怎麼向你求婚的
{\fs14}How did he ask you?

426
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:27,923
說來話長
{\fs14}Well.

427
01:00:32,863 --> 01:00:36,131
某個週五我發現自己懷孕了
{\fs14}I found out I was pregnant on a Friday.

428
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,701
告訴他時已經很晚了
{\fs14}It was late and I told him.

429
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:43,939
他看了我一眼就走了
{\fs14}And he just looked at me and he left.

430
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:53,415
午夜時他滿身酒氣地回來了
{\fs14}At midnight, he came back, smelling like liquor

431
01:00:53,417 --> 01:00:56,718
就坐在床沿上
{\fs14}and he just sat down at the edge of the bed

432
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,387
拿著枚戒指給我看
{\fs14}and showed me a ring.

433
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:03,325
他沒開口我就同意了
{\fs14}He didn't asked me, but I said yes.

434
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:07,095
然後我們就睡了
{\fs14}And then we went to bed.

435
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:13,035
戒指應該是從當鋪搞來的
{\fs14}I think it came from a pawnshop.

436
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:17,439
我並不是特別介意
{\fs14}Part of me didn't care.

437
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:22,878
我莫名覺得那是這一切發生的唯一途徑
{\fs14}Somehow I knew that was the only way it would happen.

438
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:29,251
克裏斯帶我媽去了毛伊島
{\fs14}Chris took my mom to Maui.

439
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:35,257
日落時他在沙灘上向她求了婚
{\fs14}He asked her on the beach during a sunset.

440
01:01:35,259 --> 01:01:38,860
她說那是她一生中最幸福的時刻
{\fs14}She said it was the best day of her life.

441
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:43,865
真好看
{\fs14}It's nice.

442
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:44,800
是的
{\fs14}It is.

443
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,372
想到你的束西以前是別人的
{\fs14}Sorta weird to think it was someone else's

444
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:52,174
多少會有點膈應
{\fs14}before it was yours.

445
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:13,248
就這樣
{\fs14}Yes.

446
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,216
好了
{\fs14}Okay.

447
01:04:14,218 --> 01:04:16,084
我去去就回
{\fs14}I'll be back.

448
01:04:16,086 --> 01:04:17,953
媽媽愛你 知道嗎
{\fs14}Mama loves you, okay?

449
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:23,959
好啦 你知道的 對嗎
{\fs14}Alright, you know that?

450
01:04:23,961 --> 01:04:26,361
你知道我多愛你 對嗎
{\fs14}You know how much I love you?

451
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,235
再見 寶貝閨女
{\fs14}Bye, baby girl.

452
01:04:33,237 --> 01:04:35,203
再見 甜心
{\fs14}Bye, sweetness.

453
01:04:38,008 --> 01:04:38,940
好了
{\fs14}Okay.

454
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:45,827
媽媽在這兒
{\fs14}Shh, mama's here.

455
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:49,197
丟下你真是對不起
{\fs14}I'm so sorry I left you.

456
01:07:50,434 --> 01:07:51,633
真對不起
{\fs14}I'm so sorry.

457
01:07:51,635 --> 01:07:53,268
對不起
{\fs14}I'm so sorry.

458
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:53,628
我一點也不瞭解你
{\fs14}Y'know, I don't know anything about you

459
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,497
除了你明顯很固執
{\fs14}other than the fact that you'restubborn.

460
01:08:55,499 --> 01:08:57,165
我不固執
{\fs14}I'm not stubborn. Aha!

461
01:08:57,167 --> 01:09:00,902
只有固執的人會立馬否認自己固執
{\fs14}Only stubborn people instantly deny being stubborn.

462
01:09:00,904 --> 01:09:02,370
你這叫套路
{\fs14}It's called entrapment.

463
01:09:02,372 --> 01:09:02,747
也許吧
{\fs14}Maybe.

464
01:09:03,874 --> 01:09:09,911
但是我們現在知道了你  毫無疑問 安 不管你到底姓什麼
{\fs14}But now we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that you, Ann, whatever the hell your last name is,

465
01:09:09,913 --> 01:09:11,179
都很固執
{\fs14}is stubborn.

466
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:14,816
你很精於此道
{\fs14}You're good at that.

467
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:16,284
精於什麼
{\fs14}What exactly?

468
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:20,488
讓我忘了自己為什麼在這兒
{\fs14}Making me forget why I'm here.

469
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:39,367
晚安 克裏斯
{\fs14}Goodnight, Chris.

470
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:43,771
晚安
{\fs14}Goodnight.

471
01:11:39,995 --> 01:11:41,529
跟我們走吧
{\fs14}Come with us.

472
01:11:41,531 --> 01:11:42,563
這事說過了
{\fs14}We've talked about this.

473
01:11:42,565 --> 01:11:45,900
一切皆可改變
{\fs14}Things can change.

474
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:48,890
安娜貝拉·羅斯·馬歇爾
{\fs14}Annabelle rose Marshall.

475
01:13:52,961 --> 01:13:54,028
器官捐獻者
{\fs14}Organ donor.

476
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:56,731
你真行
{\fs14}Good for you.

477
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:06,674
留下吧
{\fs14}Stay.

478
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:11,045
就留在這兒吧
{\fs14}Stay right here.

479
01:14:11,047 --> 01:14:11,979
別走了
{\fs14}Stay.

480
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:15,983
不 不行
{\fs14}No. We can't.

481
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:24,025
那些留在原處的 都死在這兒了
{\fs14}Those that stay put, die here.

482
01:14:24,027 --> 01:14:25,693
我還活著呢
{\fs14}Well, I'm alive.

483
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:31,499
話是沒錯 但看看你一家子的下場
{\fs14}Yeah, but look what happened to your family.

484
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:38,072
安 我不是故意的
{\fs14}Ann, I didn't mean it.

485
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:27,989
安 真的對不起 我不是…
{\fs14}Ann, I'm so sorry, I didn't--

486
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:30,224
她肯定吃掉了一些
{\fs14}she must've taken some.

487
01:15:30,226 --> 01:15:32,927
本來還有至少一盒子餅乾的
{\fs14}I mean, there was at least a box of crackers--

488
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:37,231
噢 操 奧莉維亞
{\fs14}Oh fuck! Olivia!

489
01:15:37,233 --> 01:15:38,199
克裏斯
{\fs14}Chris!

490
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:40,668
克裏斯 等等
{\fs14}Chris, wait!

491
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:42,603
奧莉維亞
{\fs14}Olivia!

492
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:49,810
莉薇 你在哪兒
{\fs14}Liv, where are you?

493
01:15:51,681 --> 01:15:52,613
奧莉維亞
{\fs14}Olivia!

494
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:08,956
你吃到嘴裏去了嗎
{\fs14}Did you get any in your mouth?

495
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:11,292
莉薇
{\fs14}Liv?

496
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:13,327
沒有
{\fs14}No.

497
01:17:13,329 --> 01:17:14,662
你呢
{\fs14}You?

498
01:17:14,664 --> 01:17:17,198
沒 應該沒有
{\fs14}No, I don't think so.

499
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,934
你本有可能會吃到的
{\fs14}You would've tasted it.

500
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:28,409
那個東西到這兒來了
{\fs14}That thing that came up here.

501
01:17:28,411 --> 01:17:30,044
沒有
{\fs14}They didn't.

502
01:17:30,046 --> 01:17:32,647
一定是食物太稀缺了
{\fs14}Food must be scarce.

503
01:17:32,649 --> 01:17:34,649
你還是想留下來嗎
{\fs14}You still wanna stay.

504
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:41,856
我們明天一早就出發
{\fs14}We're leaving in the morning.

505
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:46,260
你怎麼樣啊 小美人
{\fs14}How are you, pretty girl?

506
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:48,996
你看到什麼了啊
{\fs14}What do you see?

507
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:51,098
你看到什麼了
{\fs14}What do you see?

508
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:54,101
你喜歡和媽媽待在一起嗎
{\fs14}Yes, you like being with your mama?

509
01:18:01,943 --> 01:18:03,811
很好 很好 我們要走啦
{\fs14}Yes, yes, here we go.

510
01:18:17,259 --> 01:18:18,159
噢 海莉
{\fs14}Oh, Hailey.

511
01:18:18,161 --> 01:18:19,894
過來 寶寶
{\fs14}Come here, my love.

512
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:22,096
我們走了 我們走了
{\fs14}Here we go, here we go.

513
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:43,384
我很抱歉
{\fs14}I'm so sorry.

514
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:46,353
我真的很抱歉
{\fs14}I'm so sorry.

515
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:02,136
克裏斯
{\fs14}Chris.

516
01:19:02,138 --> 01:19:03,337
克裏斯 停下
{\fs14}Chris, stop.

517
01:19:03,339 --> 01:19:04,505
你為什麼不和我們一起
{\fs14}Why won't you come with us?

518
01:19:04,507 --> 01:19:05,840
因為
{\fs14}Because,

519
01:19:05,842 --> 01:19:07,174
我 我還沒有準備好
{\fs14}I'm, I'm not ready.

520
01:19:07,176 --> 01:19:09,376
你他媽的會死在這裏的
{\fs14}You're gonna fucking die here!

521
01:19:09,378 --> 01:19:12,780
也許我就他媽的應該死在這裏
{\fs14}Well, maybe I deserve to fucking die here.

522
01:19:12,782 --> 01:19:14,915
哦 原來是這麼回事
{\fs14}Oh, so that's what this is.

523
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:17,384
你把這當作是某種懲罰
{\fs14}This is some sorta punishment.

524
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:19,887
不管你曾做過些什麼 別管他媽的贖罪了
{\fs14}Fucking atone for whatever it is you did

525
01:19:19,889 --> 01:19:21,255
趕緊翻篇上路吧
{\fs14}and move on, already.

526
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:23,157
這個世界不是你說了饒恕了之後
{\fs14}This isn't a world where you can just forgive

527
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:24,225
就能向前看的
{\fs14}and move on.

528
01:19:26,227 --> 01:19:28,262
我們過去搞砸了事情之後會承認錯誤
{\fs14}We use to be able to fuck up and then say you're sorry

529
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:31,966
然而一旦自我感覺良好後又會重蹈覆轍
{\fs14}and feel better until the next time you fuck up.

530
01:19:31,968 --> 01:19:35,035
有了女兒之後我不會再犯下一次了
{\fs14}With my daughter, there was no next time.

531
01:19:35,037 --> 01:19:37,905
所以我能向誰道歉
{\fs14}So who can I apologize to?

532
01:19:37,907 --> 01:19:39,273
哈 克裏斯
{\fs14}Huh, Chris?

533
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:41,075
這裏已經沒有人了
{\fs14}There's no one here.

534
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:43,944
我的妻子
{\fs14}Yeah well, my wife,

535
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,514
她也不在這
{\fs14}she isn't here either.

536
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:51,318
我在她女兒面前親手把她媽殺了
{\fs14}I fucking killed her in front of her daughter.

537
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:54,321
她曾經是不是他們中的一員不重要
{\fs14}And it doesn't matter if she was one of them or not,

538
01:19:54,323 --> 01:19:55,856
我都面對過
{\fs14}I confronted it.

539
01:19:55,858 --> 01:20:01,128
我不怪自己 不怪她 都是他們的錯
{\fs14}And I don't blame me, I don't blame her, I blame them.

540
01:20:02,063 --> 01:20:06,267
那個不正常的世界 安 是你自己的
{\fs14}The only world that won't right itself, Ann, is your own.

541
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:12,973
不正常的原因也是因為你
{\fs14}And the reason for that is because of you.

542
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:17,144
跟這裏發生的一切無關 跟北邊也無關 只跟你有關
{\fs14}Not because of what happened here or what's north, you.

543
01:20:19,414 --> 01:20:23,217
你的家人他們都不在這裏了
{\fs14}Look, your family, they aren't here anymore,

544
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:26,887
但是你還在
{\fs14}but you are.

545
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:34,195
所以求你了 直面遺憾 接受現實
{\fs14}So please, just tell yourself you're sorry, accept it

546
01:20:34,197 --> 01:20:36,864
走出陰霾 繼續前行
{\fs14}and move the fuck on, already.

547
01:21:18,306 --> 01:21:20,908
我們需要更多的食物
{\fs14}We're gonna need more food.

548
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:25,379
我自己忙不過來
{\fs14}And I won't be able to get it by myself.

549
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:28,048
那你告訴我讓我干哈
{\fs14}You just tell me what to do.

550
01:21:29,484 --> 01:21:31,252
我也來
{\fs14}I'm coming, too.

551
01:21:31,254 --> 01:21:32,119
莉薇 你不用來
{\fs14}Liv, no your not.

552
01:21:32,121 --> 01:21:33,954
算我一個
{\fs14}I'm coming!

553
01:21:33,956 --> 01:21:38,626
我和安還有其他人一樣可以幫上忙
{\fs14}I'm just the same as Ann or anyone else, I can help.

554
01:21:38,628 --> 01:21:42,096
眾人拾柴火焰高
{\fs14}Three carrying food is better than two.

555
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:46,934
好吧
{\fs14}Fine.

556
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:50,404
克裏斯會引開它們
{\fs14}Chris will distract them.

557
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:54,108
我們要做的就是
{\fs14}All you and I will do is fill our packs

558
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:55,042
盡可能的裝滿行囊
{\fs14}with everything you can.

559
01:21:55,044 --> 01:21:57,111
只要食物 別的不要
{\fs14}Just food, nothing else.

560
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,414
然後撒腿就跑
{\fs14}And then we run.

561
01:22:01,283 --> 01:22:05,152
看到它們你就跑 不用管我
{\fs14}First sign of them, you run, don't worry about me.

562
01:22:05,154 --> 01:22:06,086
懂了嗎 莉薇
{\fs14}Okay, Liv?

563
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:12,326
莉薇 你還好嗎
{\fs14}Liv, you okay?

564
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:15,262
我還好
{\fs14}Yeah, I'm fine.

565
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:18,032
好的
{\fs14}Okay.

566
01:22:38,553 --> 01:22:39,486
嘿
{\fs14}Hey.

567
01:22:40,655 --> 01:22:42,690
我們都不會有事的
{\fs14}Look, we're all gonna be fine.

568
01:22:42,692 --> 01:22:44,959
克裏斯會沒事的
{\fs14}Chris, Chris is gonna be fine.

569
01:22:44,961 --> 01:22:45,693
我知道
{\fs14}I know.

570
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:49,296
我知道他不會有事的
{\fs14}I know he's gonna be fine.

571
01:23:26,568 --> 01:23:32,339
該我們了 走吧
{\fs14}That's us. Let's go.

572
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:19,620
有什麼食物就拿什麼
{\fs14}Grab any food you can find.

573
01:24:25,593 --> 01:24:28,328
莉薇 加快速度
{\fs14}Liv, we gotta be quick!

574
01:24:41,476 --> 01:24:43,744
有什麼拿什麼
{\fs14}Just grab any food you can.

575
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:04,264
奧利維亞 怎麼了
{\fs14}Olivia, what the hell?

576
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,266
我們要走了
{\fs14}We gotta go.

577
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:49,743
你們他媽
{\fs14}What are you...

578
01:25:50,745 --> 01:25:53,247
我們得...
{\fs14}We have to, we have to...

579
01:25:53,249 --> 01:25:54,314
我們得...
{\fs14}We have to--

580
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:58,852
我以為會出更多的血呢
{\fs14}Thought it would bleed more.

581
01:26:04,627 --> 01:26:05,759
不
{\fs14}No!

582
01:26:05,761 --> 01:28:44,818
別
{\fs14}Don't! Liv!

583
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:47,354
怎麼了 它們在追我
{\fs14}What's wrong? They're after me,

584
01:28:47,356 --> 01:28:48,021
安呢
{\fs14}where's Ann?

585
01:28:48,023 --> 01:28:48,889
它們沒有
{\fs14}No, they're not.

586
01:28:48,891 --> 01:28:49,756
我甩開了它們
{\fs14}I lost them.

587
01:28:49,758 --> 01:28:51,425
安呢
{\fs14}Where's Ann?

588
01:28:51,427 --> 01:28:52,092
她
{\fs14}She--

589
01:28:52,094 --> 01:28:53,560
安呢
{\fs14}where's Ann?
