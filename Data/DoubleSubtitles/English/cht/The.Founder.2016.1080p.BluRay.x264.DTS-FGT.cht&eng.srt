1
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:33,590
基於真實故事改編

2
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:33,590
Based on a true Story

3
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:41,380
大創業家

4
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,080
我知道你想說什麼

5
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,080
I know what you're thinkin'...

6
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,090
我為什麼需要5頭設備？

7
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,090
What the heck do I need a 5- spindle for...

8
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,760
3頭設備足夠我用了

9
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,760
when I barely sell enough milkshakes

10
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,910
我只需銷售足夠的奶昔 不是嗎？

11
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,910
to justify my 3- spindle. Right?

12
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:55,880
錯！

13
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:55,880
Wrong.

14
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,290
你是否聽說過先有雞還是先有蛋的經典問題？

15
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,290
Are you familiar with the notion of the chicken or the egg

16
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,870
格裏菲斯先生 我剛剛提到那樣會花錢

17
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,870
Mr. Griffith, I mentionedthat there'd be costs.

18
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,440
當然 我認為這裏也適用此理論

19
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,440
Well, I think it applies here.

20
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,200
你不需要多用途食物攪拌機

21
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,200
Do you not need the multimixer

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,350
因為... 真見鬼... 你沒有賣出足夠多的奶昔

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,350
because, well heck, you're not selling enough milkshakes.

24
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,000
或者說 你沒有銷售足夠的奶昔

25
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,000
Or are you not selling enough milkshakes

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,910
是因為你沒有多用途食物攪拌機

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,910
because you don't have a multimixer?

28
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,920
我更相信是後者

29
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,920
I firmly believe it's the latter.

30
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,880
因為你的客戶來到這裏

31
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,880
Because your customer comes in here and he

32
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,030
他知道如果他點了一杯你製作的奶昔

33
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,030
knows if he orders a shake from your establishment

34
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,070
卻需要一個超長的等待時間

35
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,070
that well, he's in for a terrific wait.

36
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,630
他告訴自己 上次我點這裏的奶昔

37
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,630
He's done it before and he thinks to himself

38
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,350
神吶

39
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,350
well by golly,

40
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,520
我不會再點了

41
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,520
I'm not gonna make that mistake again.

42
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,890
但是如果你有王子城堡牌

43
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,890
But if You had the Prince Castle

44
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,380
5頭飲料機 多用途食物攪拌機

45
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,380
5- spindle, multi- mixer

46
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,140

我們將會極大提高你的生產力

49
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,160

52
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,110
記住我的話

53
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,110
Mark my words.

54
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,380
甜甜圈和錢

55
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,380
Dollars and donuts

56
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,910
你將會賣掉更多的垃圾食品

57
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,910
you'll be sellin' more of those sons of bitches

58
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,500
繼續攪拌你的奶昔商業

59
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,500
then you can shake a stick at.

60
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,970
你增加供應量 需求量就隨之增長

61
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,970
You increase the supply,and the demand will follow

62
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,450
增加供應量 增長需求 循環往復

63
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,450
Increase supply, demand follows.

64
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,480
雞還是蛋先？你是否明白我的邏輯了？

65
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,480
Chicken, egg. Do you follow my logic?

66
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,890
我知道你明白了 因為你是個具有前瞻性眼光的聰明傢伙

67
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,890
I know you do because you're a bright, forward thinking guy who

68
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,740
當你聽到這條消息就知道這是個好主意

69
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,740
knows a good idea when he hears one.

70
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,870
所以...

71
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,870
So...

72
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,490
你怎麼看？

73
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,490
What do you say?

74
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,210
呵呵...

75
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,210
Nah.

76
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,900
非常感謝

77
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,900
But thanks anyways.

78
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,570

79
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,570
Order's up.

80
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,710
密蘇里州 聖路易斯

81
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,110
服務員？

82
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,110
Miss?

83
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,360
還要等多久？

84
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,360
How much longer?

85
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,230
再等幾分鐘

86
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,230
It shouldn't be a few more minutes.

87
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,630
20分鐘前你就說過了

88
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,630
You'v said that 20 minutes ago.

89
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,700
對不起 今天太忙了

90
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,700
I'm so sorry.We're really busy today.

91
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,250
貝爾維爾 27英里

92
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,250
Belleville,27 miles

93
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,150
看 這是唯一的原因

94
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,150
You see it's only sense.

95
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,520
您的預算會減少

96
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,520
The reason your budget will decrease

97
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,990
供需循環關係

98
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,990
supply, demand will follow.

99
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,920
雞和蛋誰先

100
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,920
Chicken and the egg

101
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,170
你明白我說什麼了？

102
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,170
Do you follow my logic?

103
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:42,900
你當然明白了

104
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:42,900
Of course you do.

105
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,420
你是個具有前瞻性眼光的聰明傢伙

106
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,420
You're a bright, foward- thinking guy

107
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,190
當你聽到這條消息就知道這是個好主意

108
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,190
who knows a good idea when he hears one.

109
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,750
所以... 你怎麼看？

110
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,750
So... What do you say?

111
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,190
嘿！

112
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,190
Hey.

113
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,480
- 這是...  - 請享用

114
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,480
- What is...  - Enjoy.

115
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,180
我要的是燒烤牛肉

116
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,180
I ordered the barbecue beef.

117
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,050
我說 我有很多好的潛在客戶

118
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,050
Here I said I got a lot of good leads.

119
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,440
非常非常棒的客戶

120
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,440
Real, real strong leads.

121
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,170
是的

122
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,170
Yup.

123
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,330
什麼？

124
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,330
What?

125
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,040
沒什麼

126
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,040
Nothing.

127
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,610
這很棒

128
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,610
That's wonderful.

129
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,120
喔

130
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,120
Wow.

131
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,030
我只是說他們非常感興趣

132
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,030
I mean it's just tremendous interest.

133
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,200
好吧 他們感興趣

134
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,200
Well I'm sure there is.

135
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,860
聽起來你不相信我

136
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,860
You sound like you don't believe me.

137
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,130
我當然相信你 為什麼不？

138
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,130
Of course I do. Why wouldn't

139
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:37,550
好吧

140
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:37,550
Alright

141
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,780
我還有非常多的文件工作需要完成 所以...

142
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,780
Well I got a lot of paperwork to do here so, uh...

143
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,850
明天 明天我將會在路上給你打電話

144
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,850
I'll, I'll call you from the road tomorrow.

145
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,500
好的

146
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,500
Okay.

147
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,910
好吧 好吧

148
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,910
Alright. Alright.

149
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:29,040
堅持 這世界沒什麼能夠替代堅持

150
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:29,040
Persistence. Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence.

151
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,610
天賦不能

152
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,610
Talent won't.

153
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,750
我們常見到失敗的天賦異稟者

154
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,750
Nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent.

155
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,010
天才不能

156
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,010
Genius won't.

157
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,220
無法實現目標的天才早已是陳詞濫調

158
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,220
Unrewarded genius is practically a cliche.

159
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,650
教育不能

160
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,650
Education won't.

161
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,690
這世界充斥著高學歷的傻瓜

162
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,690
The world is full of educated fools.

163
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,480
堅持和決心是所有的力量

164
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,480
Persistence and determination alone are all powerful.

165
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,210
表現出你不會被任何東西擊敗

166
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,210
Show that you don't have to be defeated by anything.

167
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,970
你內心平靜 身體強健

168
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,970
That you can have peace of mind, improved health

169
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,610
和用不完的力量

170
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,610
and a never- ceasing flow of energy.

171
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,880
如果你每天都嘗試做這些事情

172
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,880
If you attempt each and every day to achieve these things

173
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,710
結果會令你刮目相看

174
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,710
the results will make themselves obvious to you.

175
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,950
雖然這聽起來像是個神奇的概念

176
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,950
While it may sound like a magical notion

177
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,600
你需要創立你自己的未來

178
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,600
it is in you to create your own future.

179
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,040
我們這一代最重大的發現是

180
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,040
The greatest discovery of my generation is

181
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:28,020
心態能夠改變一個人的生活

182
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:28,020
that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitude of mind.

183
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,330
拉爾夫·瓦爾多·愛默生曾說過

184
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,330
Ralph Waldo Emerson declared...

185
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,530
"人會成為他每天都想要成為的那個人"

186
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,530
"A man is what he thinks about all day long."

王子城堡公司的銷售

from Prince Castle sales.

254
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,100
我打這個電話是因為有人給我下訂單

255
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,100
The reason I'm calling is someone placed an order

256
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,480
是的 是我訂的

257
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,480
Yes, yes. That was me.

How soon can you get them out here?

260
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,430
這就是我為什麼給迪克你打電話

261
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,430
Well that's actually why I'm phoning now Dick actually

262
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,950
我認為可能有某種誤解

263
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,950
I think there might have been some kind of miscommunication

264

272
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,260
是的 額... 你知道嗎？我認為定錯了

273
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,260
Youh, uh... you know what? I think that was a mistake.

274
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,380
我也是這麼認為的

275
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,380

00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:34,890
你確認嗎？

337
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:34,890
Are you sure?

338
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,650
不錯

339
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,650
Great.

340
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,580
哪裏有... 你懂的 餐具和托盤還有所有的配料

341
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,580
Where are the uh... you know, silverware and plates and everything.

342
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,390
都在袋子裏了 吃完後可以全部扔掉

343
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,390
You just eat it straight outta the wrapper, and then you throw it all out.

344
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,650
好吧

345
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,650
Alright.

346
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,240
行

347
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,240
Okay.

348
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,300
我在哪裏吃？

349
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,300
Where do I eat it?

350
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,490
在你車裏

351
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,490
In your car

352
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,280
在公園

353
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,280
At the park

354
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,870
在家裏

355
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,870
At home

356
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,890
想在哪裏都行

357
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,890
Wherever you'd like!

358
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,440
好的 好的... 謝謝！

359
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,440
Okay, okay... thanks.

360
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,250
我們能坐這裏嗎？

361
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,250
May we join you?

362
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,270
嗯？行 當然

363
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,270
Huh? Yeah.Sure.

364
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,700
謝謝你！

365
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,700
Thank you!

366
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,660
嗯 就扔在這裏 我來管後續的處理

367
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,660
Ah, just throw it right there, I'll take care of it.

368
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:01,980
這裏怎麼樣？

369
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:01,980
How is everything?

370
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,400
這也許是我此生吃過的最好的漢堡

371
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,400
This might be the best hamburger I've ever had in my life.

372
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,620
啊 非常榮幸

373
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,620
Ah  we'd pleased.

374
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,460
嗯... 我是麥當勞的麥克

375
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,460
Uh... Mac McDonald.

376
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,600
哦！

377
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,600
Oh!

378
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,140
好的 看這裏

379
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,140
Well, look at this.

380
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,780
雷·克羅克

381
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,780
Ray Kroc.

382
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,850
賣食品攪拌機的

383
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,850
The multimixer fella.

384
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,230
你曾和我兄弟迪克通過電話

385
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,230
You spoke with my brother Dick.

386
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,110
是我 就是我

387
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,110
I did, yeah.

388
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,670
你來這裏幹什麼？

389
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,670
What are you doing way out here?

390
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,110
我在洛杉磯 開個會

391
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,110
I'm in Los Angeles, business meeting

392
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,630
我想 這麼近 就順道過來看看 打個招呼

393
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,630
I thought, I'm in the neighborhood, I should just swing by and say hello.

394
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,130
非常榮幸你這麼做

395
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,130
Well, I'm sure glad you did.

396
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,230
做到這些 一定靠運營管理

397
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,230
This whole thing. This is some operation.

398
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,420
介意參觀一下嗎？

399
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,420
Care for a little tour?

400
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:32,980
你是說...

401
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:32,980
Of the...

402
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,520
是的

403
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,520
Yeah.

404
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,700
是的 我願意

405
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,700
Yeah, I would.

406
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,430
好的 先吃完這些 我來找你

407
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,430
Well, finish up, I'll come back for you.

408
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,360
沒問題！謝謝！

409
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,360
Alright thy! Thanks.

410
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,660
「速度」是這個遊戲的名字

411
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,660
Speed. That's the name of the game.

412
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,890
每個麥當勞漢堡的第一步就是烤肉

413
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,890
The first stop for every McDonald's hamburger is the grill

414
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:29,500
由兩位廚師負責 他們的核心工作就是確保這些牛肉烤制火候精準且漂亮

415
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:29,500
manned by 2 cooks whose soul job it is to grill those all beef beauties to perfection.

416
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,700
在做肉餅的同時

417
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,700
Meanwhile, as the patty cooks

418
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,760
幫廚會製作好小圓麵包

419
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,760
our dressers get the buns ready.

420
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,680
小心！

421
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,680
Watch out!

422
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:35,770
漢堡借道！

423
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:35,770
Burger crossing!

424
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,440
漢堡借道 漢堡借道

425
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,440
Burgers crossing. Burgers crossing.

426
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,020
每一個麥當勞的漢堡

427
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,020
Every McDonald's burger

428
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,710
有兩片醃黃瓜

429
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,710
has 2 pickles

430
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,570
一捏的洋蔥和精確擠壓出來的番茄醬與黃芥末醬

431
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,570
a pinch of onions and a precise shot of ketchup and mustard.

432
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,630
你從哪裏買到這些？

433
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,630
Now where'd you get those?

434
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,190
我們自己做的

435
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,190
We made them.

436
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:49,710
做的？

437
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:49,710
Made them?

438
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,770
是的 定制建造  整個廚房都是

439
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,770
Yeah, custom built. Whole kitchen is.

440
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,530
下一個！

441
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,530
Next!

442
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,060
這簡直...

443
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,060
That is...

444
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,020
最終組裝部門 我們把所有的原料組合

445
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,020
The finishing station where we put the whole thing together.

446
00:14:59,250 --> 00:14:59,600
並且

447
00:14:59,250 --> 00:14:59,600
And

448
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:03,740
Wow out!

449
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:03,740
哇 出貨！

450
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,030
新鮮美味的漢堡從烤制部到櫃檯只需30秒

451
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,030
A fresh delicious burger from grill to counter in 30 seconds.

452
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,920
你究竟怎麼想出這個的？

453
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,920
How the heck did you come up with this?

454
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,700
額 不是我  是我們  迪克·麥當勞 我兄弟

455
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,700
Oh I didn't. We did. Dick McDonald, my brother.

456
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,220
嘿 兄弟 我要告訴你  這簡直是...

457
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,220
Hi, boy I gotta tell you. This is the most

458
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:17,980
好吧 很高興見到你

459
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:17,980
well it's nice to meet you.

460
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:21,710
薯條

461
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:21,710
The fries

462
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:22,860
有什麼問題？

463
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:22,860
What about them?

464
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,590
脆度少了5%

465
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,590
They're 5 percent to crisp.

466
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,160
不 它們剛剛好

467
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,160
No, they're perfect.

468
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,220
我想 我們應該縮減為2分50秒

469
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,220
I think we should drop to 2 minutes, 50 seconds.

470
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,960
這不就是我們之前做的？

471
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,960
Wasn't that what we were at before?

472
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,650
400℉ 不是375℉

473
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,650
400℉, not 375℉

474
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,120
提高溫度 縮短烹飪時間

475
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,120
Higher temp, shorter cook.

476
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,720
我想他們都已精確製作

477
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,720
I think they're spot on.

478
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,120
夥計 我可否？

479
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,120
Fellas excuse me, may I?

480
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,420
無意打擾 但是我想說

481
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,420
None of my beeswax, but I'm with the big fella here

482
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,470
我喜歡表面焦黃內部白色鬆軟的感覺

483
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,470
I love them. Golden brown on the outside, fluffy white inside

484
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,740
它們不會太油膩 太咸 太易碎 太...

485
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,740
and they're not too oily, salty, crunchy, whatever

486
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,390
你是誰？

487
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,390
Who are you?

488
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,430
噢 是雷·克羅克你提到的多用途食物攪拌機商

489
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,430
Oh this is Ray Kroc, the multi- mixer fella you spoke to.

490
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,970
你認為何時我們能拿到貨？

491
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,970
So when do you figure we can expect them?

492
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,250
額 用藍標航空快遞...

493
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,250
Eh... sent them blue label air so...

494
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,060
好的 好的...

495
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,060
Good, good...

496
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,660
需要它們作為備機

497
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,660
Need them for backup.

498
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,030
嘿！等等、等等...

499
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,030
Hey, wait, wait...

500
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,280
等等、等下... 請等一下

501
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,280
Wait, wait... wait a minute.

502
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,710
我想請你共進晚餐

503
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,710
I'm wanna take you out to dinner.

504
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,150
你真不是我的菜

505
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,150
You're really not my type.

506
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,770
哈 放心 是你們兄弟倆

507
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,770
Ha You and your brother.

508
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:03,550
為什麼？

509
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:03,550
What for?

510
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,680
這是我在這個行業中這些年見過的最出眾的餐廳

511
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,680
This is the most remarkable food restaurant I've ever seen in all my years in this industry.

512
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,830
我在這裏全看過了

513
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,830
and I've seen it all.

514
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,870
我還想聽你們的故事

515
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,870
I wanna hear your story.

516
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,300
好的 當我們還年輕並且飢餓的時候

517
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,300
Well... we were young and hungry...

518
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,640
在新罕布什爾州我們找不到工作 所以

519
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,640
and there wasn't a job to be had in all of New Hampshire

520
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,830
我們決定收拾行李走西口

521
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,830
so we decided to pack our bags and head West.

522
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,800
去好萊塢

523
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,800
To Hollywood.

524
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,390
我想求職電影行業

525
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,390
I wanted to be in the movie business

526
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,850
而迪克 他只想找份工作

527
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,850
and well... Dick? He wanted to be employed.

528
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,730
我們在哥倫比亞影業開卡車

529
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,730
So we landed a job at Columbia Pictures driving trucks.

530
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,980
多年過後

531
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,980
Then after a few years

532
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,470
我們積蓄可以買一個小型演出商業

533
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,470
we had enough saved to buy our own little piece of show business

534
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,090
位於格倫多拉的一個漂亮的小型劇院

535
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,090
a beautiful little movie theater in Glendora

536
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,930
除了購買的時代 簡直是一流的

537
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,930
which would have been swell except for the timing.

538
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,820
那是9月29日

539
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,820
It was September of '29.

540
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,340
喔

541
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,340
Oh

542
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,690
我們正在放映百老匯的黃金挖掘者

543
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,690
One minute we're screening the Gold Diggers of Broadway

544
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,010
一分鐘內就有人問：兄弟你可否少收一毛錢

545
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,010
the next it's brother can you spare a dime.

546
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,680
我不能

547
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,680
I couldn't.

548
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,210
這座城市沒人能賺錢

549
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,210
Nobody in town was making any money

550
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,580
除了一個夥計 威利·裏德

551
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,580
except for one fella, Wiley Reed

552
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,420
他擁有一個熱狗和根啤銷售蓬

553
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,420
had a hotdog and rootbeer stand.

554
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,000
嘿 大家都要吃東西 對吧？

555
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,000
Hey, people still gotta eat, right?

556
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,290
所以我們決定開屬於自己的小店

557
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,290
So we decided to open up our own little stand

558
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,680
賣熱狗、橙汁...

559
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,680
Hotdogs and Orange Juice

560
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,710
在亞凱迪亞 做的還行

561
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,710
in Arcadia, and it went okay.

562
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,380
我想說 我們不是大幫派

563
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,380
I mean, we weren't going gang- busters

564
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,890
亞凱迪亞的客戶不夠

565
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,890
There just weren't enough people in Arcadia.

566
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,620
同時 隔一個城就是聖貝納迪諾

567
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,620
Meanwhile, one town over is San Bernardino

568
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,530
我們想搬家

569
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,530
and we wanna relocate

570
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,390
但是我們的錢不夠買新店面

571
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,390
but we've got no money for a new stand

572
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,060
這時 我的兄弟

573
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,060
and that's when my brother here

574
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,500
有一個絕妙的主意

575
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,500
comes up with one of his brilliant ideas

576
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,520
告訴他 迪克

577
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,520
Tell him Dick.

578
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,060
嗯...

579
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,060
Well...

580
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,710
他說：「為什麼不把我們現在的店舖搬過去?」

581
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,710
He says, "Why don't we move the stand we've got."

582
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:16,950
放到卡車上

583
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:16,950
Put it on a truck.

584
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:17,950
天才 不是嗎？

585
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:17,950
Genius, right?

586
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,270
只有一個小小的問題

587
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,270
Only there's one little problem.

588
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,620
兩個城市之間 有一座天橋

589
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,620
On the road between the two towns, there's an overpass

590
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,450
我們的店舖不能通過

591
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,450
and the building won't clear it.

592
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,160
我認為 因為這個 我們沒轍了...

593
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,160
Now I figure, that's it, we're done for...

594
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,460
但是迪克說：「為什麼不把我們的店鋸成兩半？」

595
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,460
but then Dick says, "Why don't we saw the building in half?"

596
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,310
把它鋸成兩半

597
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,310
Saw it in half.

598
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,370
真的假的

599
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,370
Come on.

600
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,100
我們讓餐館搬家 建立新店

601
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,100
So we've moved the restaurant, we're setting up shop

602
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,650
我們想做一些當年的流行的事情

603
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,650
but now we wanna do a few a few tweaks

604
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,340
因為那已經是1940年

605
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,340
because now it's 1940

606
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,740
到處都是汽車餐館

607
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,740
and drive- in's are all the rage,

608
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,020
我是說時當時最熱門的模式

609
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,020
I mean they are the hottest thing going

610
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,050
我說：「迪克 我們要做這個」

611
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,050
and I say, "Dick, we gotta get in on this"...

612
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:55,600
迪克說

613
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:55,600
and Dick says

614
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,130
「好的」

615
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,130
"Okay"

616
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,540
兩個月後 我們開業了

617
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,540
and 2 months later we open for business

618
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,400
麥當勞燒烤店

619
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,400
McDonald's Famous Barbecue.

620
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,810
有27道菜品

621
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,810
27 item menu

622
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,600
制服女侍將食品送到你的車裏

623
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,600
uniformed waitresses bring your food right to the car

624
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,900
開始做的不錯 我們即將大幹一場

625
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,900
and it goes gang- busters. We're going great guns!

626
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,650
但是... 銷量停滯不前

627
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,650
But then... sales start to level off.

628
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,910
我們發現汽車餐廳模式有本質的問題

629
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,910
The drive- in model as we've learned has a few built in problems.

630
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,670
親 告訴我

631
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,670
Tell me about it.

632
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,650
首先 客戶群定位有問題

633
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,650
For starters, there's the customer issue.

634
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,720
汽車餐廳模式往往會吸引到不太理想的客戶群

635
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,720
Drive- in's tend to attract, shall we say,a less than desirable clientele.

636
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,290
問題青少年

637
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,290
Teenagers

638
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,060
小混混、小流氓

639
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,060
Hot- rodders and hooligans and

640
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,020
和穿著藍色牛仔褲的少年犯

641
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,020
juvenile deliquents in blue jeans.

642
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,200
還有提供服務的問題

643
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,200
And then there's the service.

644
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,560
它永遠會花很長時間才能等到食物

645
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,560
It takes forever and a day for your food door to arrive

646
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,830
而且一旦送到

647
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,830
and when it finally does

648
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,640
通常會送錯餐點

649
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,640
It's usually wrong.

650
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,000
是啊

651
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,000
Yeah.

652
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,330
服務生太忙了

653
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,330
The car hops are too busy

654
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:36,080
很容易記錯你要的是奶油草莓汁而不是櫻桃汁

655
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:36,080
dodging gropes to remember that you wanted strawberry phosphate, not cherry.

656
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,640
即使她們記清楚了所有信息

657
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,640
Well that's if they remember it at all.

658
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,940
還有 運營費

659
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,940
And then there's the expenses.

660
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,660
大量的工資支付給大量的員工

661
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,660
The huge payroll due to the large staff required

662
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,700
餐具不停地被打碎或者偷走

663
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,700
and dishes constantly getting broken or stolen.

664
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,170
巨大的開銷

665
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,170
Tremendous overhead.

666
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,780
有一天 迪克發現

667
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,780
So one day Dick has a realization.

668
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,090
他發現我們銷量最好的只有三樣菜品

669
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,090
He sees that the bulk of our sales are in only 3 items.

670
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,140
漢堡、薯條和軟飲料

671
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,140
Hamburgers, french fries, soft- drinks.

672
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,420
占87%

673
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,420
87%.

674
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,000
因此我們告訴自己

675
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,000
So we say to ourselves

676
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,370
讓我們專注於我們真正能銷售出去的產品吧

677
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,370
let's focus on what sells and that's exactly what we do

678
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,320
停售雞胸肉和墨西哥玉米蒸卷

679
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,320
Brisket gone, tamales gone,

680
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,440
我們不僅限於此

681
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,440
but we don't stop there.

682
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,200
我們分析了所有的環節

683
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,200
We look at everything.

684
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,350
我們還不需要些什麼？

685
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,350
hat else don't we need?

686
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,540
發現很多

687
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,540
Turns out quite a lot.

688
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,090
車位送餐員

689
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,090
Car hops

690
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,360
自己走到窗口取你自己的食物

691
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,360
Walk up to a window, get your food yourself.

692
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:09,460
餐盤

693
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:09,460
Dishes.

694
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,430
全部是一次性紙質包裝

695
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,430
All paper packaging, disposable.

696
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,130
香煙販售機、自動點唱機

697
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,130
Cigarette machines, jukeboxes

698
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,160
不要底層人的設備

699
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,160
drive out the riff raff.

700
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,950
建立面向家庭的就餐環境

701
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,950
Creating a family friendly environment here.

702
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,460
但這還不夠

703
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,460
But that's not enough.

704
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:18,970
不錯

705
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:18,970
Alright.

706
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,190
看 我們的全部生活已經決定拋棄別人的想法

707
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,190
See, our whole lives we』d piggy- backed off of other people's ideas

708
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,070
我們想做一些不僅僅是與眾不同的事情

709
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,070
We wanted something that wasn't just different.

710
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,180
必須做的更好

711
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,180
It had to be better.

712
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,000
必須是我們想做的事情

713
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,000
It needed to be ours.

714
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,930
這讓我們做了個重要決定

715
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,930
And that's what brings us to the biggest cut of all.

716
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:31,800
決定是？

717
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:31,800
Which was?

718
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,670
候餐時間

719
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,670
The wait.

720
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,840
30秒完成訂單而非30分鐘

721
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,840
Orders ready in 30 seconds, not 30 minutes.

722
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,030
額滴神啊！

723
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,030
Mecca.

724
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,190
一天晚上 我們相互對視

725
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,190
We look at each other one night

726
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,530
你我想到一起了 對吧？

727
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,530
You thinking what I'm thinking?

728
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,110
我們拆分所有的細節 重新分配 重新建...

729
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,110
We're gonna have to tear down, rebuild, reconfi...

730
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,650
重新思考所有環節

731
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,650
rethink the whole dam thing.

732
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,110
我們說到要將當前不錯的業務關它幾個月

733
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,110
We're talking about shutting down a thriving business for months.

734
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,540
人們都認為我們瘋了

735
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,540
People are gonna think we're crazy.

736
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,700
我們那時確實瘋了

737
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,700
We were, crazy.

738
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,100
你將會愛上我們的做法

739
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,100
And you are gonna love how we did it.

740
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,660
迪克 你來告訴他

741
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,660
Dick, you gotta tell him.

742
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,500
網球場

743
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,500
Tennis court.

744
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,190
好吧 他把我帶到網球場

745
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,190
Okay, he brings me out to this tennis court

746
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,350
他精確地在場地上畫出我們的廚房

747
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,350
and he's drawn this line the exact dimenions of our kitchen

748
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,550
右側是水池 擠壓機在左側

749
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,550
Sink on the right, extruder on the left.

750
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,950
裝袋和打包

751
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,950
Bagging and hood.

752
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:07,980
好的 配菜...

753
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:07,980
Okay. Garnish...

754
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,910
這是... 額...

755
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,910
this is uh...

756
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,890
漢堡成品

757
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,890
burger finish.

758
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:10,410
收到

759
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:10,410
Got it.

760
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,200
這裏是漢堡滑軌

761
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,200
and then this is burger slide.

762
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,650
我們可以移動這些

763
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,650
We could just move those.

764
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:15,410
好的

765
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:15,410
Okay.

766
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,940
食物攪拌機 軟飲...

767
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,940
Multimixer, soft drinks...

768
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,530
好的

769
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,530
Ok

770
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,910
我把所有的員工帶到這裏

771
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,910
We bring out our whole staff

772
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,630
讓他們模擬工作時的操作

773
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,630
and we have them go through the motions

774
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,680
假裝做漢堡和薯條

775
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,680
making pretend burgers and fries.

776
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,020
好的 史蒂夫 你必須預料到...

777
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,020
Alright, Steve, you gotta anticipate that...

778
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,790
你需要保持托盤的高度

779
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,790
You gotta keep the tray level!

780
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,570
好的

781
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,570
OK

782
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,790
迪克就在這些設備預畫好的位置間遊走

783
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,790
Dick is running around with a stick marking where all the equipment should be.

784
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,450
捲起來

785
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,450
Tuck in.

786
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,770
托尼你是否在真實操作的時候會忽略酸黃瓜？

787
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,770
Tony are you going to skip the pickles when we're really doing it?

788
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,590
他們不斷重複

789
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,590
They do it over and over,

790
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,460
拆分步驟 就像在編排瘋狂漢堡芭蕾舞

791
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,460
hashing it out, choreographing it like some crazy burger ballet.

792
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,620
那裏發生什麼了？

793
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,620
What's going on over there?

794
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,840
正確

795
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,840
Yes.

796
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,810
不對！

797
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,810
No!

798
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,010
不對！

799
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,010
NO!

800
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,000
所有人停下！停下！

801
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,000
Everybody stop! Stop！

802
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,010
配菜 1號

803
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,010
Garnish #1.

804
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,330
配菜 2號

805
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,330
Garnish #2.

806
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,470
你負責醃黃瓜 你負責洋蔥

807
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,470
You've got pickles, you've got onions.

808
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,250
這就是該死的漢堡

809
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,250
It's a goddamn hamburger.

810
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,300
繼續 都離開

811
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,300
Come on, clear out.

812
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,550
讓我們徹底清場

813
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,550
Let's clear off.

814
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,960
這次用粉紅粉筆

815
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,960
It's time for the pink chalk.

816
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,540
這是根啤 橙汁區

817
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,540
and then rootbeer, orange.

818
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,810
看到這裏的開放空間了嗎？

819
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,810
See see all this open space here now?

820
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,300
我們重新擺放了油炸機

821
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,300
We've rearrange the fry situation

822
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,410
so now it's stage left, the fryer is stage right.

823
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,410
現在 它位於操作台左側 油炸機在它右側

824
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,380
再來

825
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,380
Again...

826
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:17,640
這樣很棒

827
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:17,640
That's great.

828
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:18,960
弟兄們上

829
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:18,960
Come on guys.

830
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,560
旋轉台部分比較緊張..

831
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,560
We're pretty tied up here with the Lazy Susan...

832
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,050
是的 注意它

833
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,050
Yeah, watch it.

834
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,390
如果用旋轉台會耗費時間...

835
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,390
this is the timing if the Lazy Susan...

836
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,860
這些是漢堡成品 你不能...

837
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,860
Those are finished burgers! You can't...

838
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,230
等等

839
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,230
hold it!

840
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,190
我始終認為這裏有其它解決方案

841
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,190
I still think there's a 3rd version.

842
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,260
你想移動什麼？

843
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,260
What you want to move?

844
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,200
我想移動全部

845
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,200
I want to move everything.

846
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,260
請到操作台左側

847
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,260
Back to stage left please.

848
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,840
所有的都畫出來

849
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,840
Got it all drawn.

850
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,520
這樣會好些

851
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,520
This is better.

852
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,150
是這樣嗎？

853
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,150
Is that alright?

854
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,500
應該是

855
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,500
Think so.

856
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:49,670
我想...

857
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:49,670
I guess.

858
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,870
我想... 讓我們假設這些工作台...

859
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,870
I guess... let's assume our battle stations...

860
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,510
好的 好的

861
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,510
Okay, okay.

862
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,570
終於 在這樣做了約六個小時之後

863
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,570
Finally after about 6 hours of this...

864
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,250
我們安排好了一切

865
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,250
we get it just right.

866
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,340
這是一場效率的交響樂 而非浪費時間

867
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,340
It's a symphony of efficiency, not a wasted motion.

868
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,010
做的好 賈思伯！

869
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,010
Good form Jasper!

870
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,080
感覺醃黃瓜做的不錯

871
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,080
Feel good about those pickles.

872
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:20,950
番茄醬

873
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:20,950
Ketchup

874
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,130
使用你的轉盤

875
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,130
Use your Lazy Susan.

876
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,490
埋頭干 塞斯！

877
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,490
Put your back into it Seth!

878
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,800
醃黃瓜、醃黃瓜 還有——黃芥末醬！

879
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,800
And pickles and pickle and... mustard!

880
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,990
我們把藍圖帶到建造商處

881
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,990
We take the layout to a builder

882
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,260
按照我們的要求定制化打造廚房

883
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,260
custom build the kitchen to our exact specs.

884
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,670
啊哈！高速系統誕生了

885
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,670
Ta dah! The speedy system is born.

886
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,700
迄今世界上第一條食品快速生產線

887
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,700
The world's first ever system to deliver food fast.

888
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,580
這絕對是場革命...

889
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,580
It is totally revolutionary...

890
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,050
也是場徹底的災難

891
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,050
and a complete disaster.

892
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:45,420
緣何？

893
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:45,420
Why?

894
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,700
開業首日 車輛都在停車位等待

895
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,700
Opening day, cars pull up onto the lot

896
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,160
他們開始按喇叭

897
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,160
and they start honking immediately

898
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,670
因為沒有服務員去車那裏

899
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,670
because no car- hop comes up.

900
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,400
你自己點菜

901
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,400
You place your order.

902
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,490
我給他們解釋 請走到窗口點餐

903
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,490
We try to explain to them to walkup window

904
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,590
但他們 呃...

905
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,590
and they are, uh...

906
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,070
很迷惑？

907
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,070
Bewildered?

908
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,350
不 是憤怒

909
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,350
No, they are furious.

910
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,350
「你什麼意思？讓我下車？」

911
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,350
"What do you mean I gotta get out of my car?"

912
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,020
大多數顧客只是叫我們出去再開車離開

913
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,020
Most of them just cuss us out and drive off...

914
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,590
留在這裏的幾個顧客也瘋狂

915
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,590
and the few that stay are mad as heck

916
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,040
因為 他們吃掉紙 而且他們需要自己倒垃圾

917
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,040
because they are eating off paper and they've gotta discard their own trash.

918
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,400
為何？

919
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,400
Why?

920
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,160
你做的很棒

921
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,160
You're doing great.

922
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,920
你做的很棒

923
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,920
You're doing great.

924
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,080
是的 我們不能出去送到你的車裏,但是你可以來我這裏

925
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,080
Yeah, we won't be coming out to the car but you can just come on up.

926
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,420
歡迎來到麥當勞

927
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,420
Welcome to McDonald's.

928
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,220
我們也許低估了學習曲線的難度

929
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,220
We may have underestimated the learning curve.

930
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,560
五點的時候 迪克開始計算如何回到傳統汽車餐館模式

931
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,560
So by 5 o'clock, Dick is calculating how much it's gonna cost to go back to drive- in...

932
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,750
但是我還沒打算放棄

933
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,750
but I am not ready to throw in the towel.

934
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,530
所以我回到以前在好萊塢工作的日子 我對自己說

935
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,530
So I go back to our old Hollywood days, I think to myself

936
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,890
我們必須做好這個

937
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,890
we gotta go big with this.

938
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,430
我們需要做些宣傳

939
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,430
We gotta put it on a show.

940
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,610
因此我說：「迪克 我想來個豪華重開業 」

941
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,610
So I say, "Dick, I wanna throw a grand re- opening"

942
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,740
一個首映式 讓路易·伯特·梅耶(米高梅創立者)都感到羞恥的首映式

943
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,740
a gala premeire that would put Louis B. Mayer to shame.

944
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,290
所以 我們租了一些射燈

945
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,290
So we rent a bunch of spotlights

946
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,750
在哥倫比亞片場工作時曾經用過這些

947
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,750
the ones we used to haul around in the Columbia days

948
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,640
我們有煙火 雜耍小子 這是個活動

949
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,640
we get sparklers, a juggler for the kiddies, it is an event...

950
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,770
人們開車來 然後...

951
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,770
people show up in droves, and then...

952
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,970
飛蟲

953
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,970
The flies.

954
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,890
他們一定是被燈光吸引來

955
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,890
They must have been drawn by all the lights.

956
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,830
數百萬 這就是一個《出埃及記》的場景

957
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,830
Millions of them. It was like a scene out of Exodus.

958
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,550
法老釋放了以色列人

959
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,550
The pharaoh would have released the Israelites

960
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,560
徹底的災難

961
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,560
Total disaster.

962
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,130
現在是時候放棄了

963
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,130
Now it is 'towel' time.

964
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,000
第二天 迪克和我碰面 討論如何回到舊日模式

965
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,000
The next day Dick and I meet up to discuss going back to the old format.

966
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,580
這時 有個傢伙在敲櫃檯窗戶

967
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,580
And as we're talking there's a knock at the service window...

968
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,490
我告訴他 我們關門了

969
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,490
I tell him we're closed.

970
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,380
We're closed.

971
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,380
我們關門了

972
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,570
but he's looked so cute.

973
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,570
但是他看起來太可愛了

974
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,960
等等 等等

975
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,960
Hang on, hang on...

976
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:07,860
孩子 你想要些什麼？

977
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:07,860
What would you like son?

978
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,970
我能從你這裏買袋漢堡包嗎？

979
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,970
Can I buy a bag of burgers from you?

980
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:14,260
我感覺很差 重新開爐

981
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:14,260
I feel bad so I fire up the grill and I make him a batch.

982
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,390
請拿好

983
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,390
There you are.

984
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,650
他離開櫃檯時 有車停下

985
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,650
And as he's walking away from the service window, a car pulls up.

986
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,610
又有車來了

987
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,610
And then another.

988
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,110
迪克

989
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,110
Dick...

990
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,470
又有車來了

991
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,470
And then another.

992
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,240
你好 歡迎來到麥當勞

993
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,240
Hello, welcome to McDonald's.

994
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,140
你好

995
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,140
Hello there.

996
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,350
很快 就排起了隊

997
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,350
Pretty soon there's a line around the block.

998
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,400
這個詞已經被傳播

999
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,400
The word has spread.

1000
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,690
轉為出餐競賽

1001
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,690
And it's off to the races.

1002
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,620
我們一夜之間感覺好像已經做了30年

1003
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,620
And we are an overnight sensation, 30 years in making.

1004
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:04,910
這就是我們的故事

1005
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:04,910
So that's our story.

1006
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,960
特許經營權

1007
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,960
Franchise.

1008
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,870
沒聽清

1009
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,870
Beg pardon?

1010
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:51,710
特許經營權

1011
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:51,710
Franchise.

1012
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,120
特許經營你的產品

1013
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,120
Franchise the damn thing.

1014
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,100
對一家店而言 這裏簡直太棒了

1015
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,100
It's too damn good for just one location.

1016
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,480
到處都應該有麥當勞

1017
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,480
There should be McDonald's everywhere.

1018
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,730
海岸線到海岸線 越洋到其它閃亮的地區

1019
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,730
Coast to coast, sea to shining sea.

1020
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,500
克羅克先生

1021
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,500
Mr. Kroc

1022
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,360
嘿 我想對你兩個懺悔

1023
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,360
Hey, I got a confession I wanna make to you boys

1024
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,260
我來加州不是為了開什麼商務會議

1025
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,260
I'm not out here in California for any kind of business meetings.

1026
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,740
我就是為你們而來

1027
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,740
I came out here for you.

1028
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,770
幾天前 我在密蘇里的聖路易斯

1029
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,770
A few days ago I got into St. Louis, Missouri

1030
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,370
正在做一些生意 我打開了地圖

1031
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,370
and I was doing some business and I broke out my map.

1032
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:17,670
跟隨我指點在一條高速路上的一根手指

1033
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:17,670
And I followed my finger on one single highway

1034
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:18,730
向西

1035
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:18,730
West.

1036
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,130
66號公路

1037
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,130
Route 66.

1038
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:20,740
有東西告訴我...

1039
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:20,740
And somethin' told me...

1040
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,040
克羅克先生...

1041
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,040
Mr. Kroc...

1042
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,420
有東西告訴我 開車順著高速路開

1043
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,420
Somethin' told me to get into my car and drive that highway

1044
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,490
知道把我帶到哪裏了嗎？

1045
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,490
and you know where it led me?

1046
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,450
就是這裏

1047
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,450
Right here.

1048
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,850
就是這個地點

1049
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,850
Right smack dam here.

1050
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,350
就是這個難以置信的公司

1051
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,350
Right to this unbelievable establishment

1052
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,780
當我看到這些指向你的運營模式的線條時

1053
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,780
and when I saw these lines to your home operation

1054
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,390
我品嚐了你的產品

1055
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,390
and I tasted your product

1056
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,450
我意識到這些必須發生

1057
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,450
I knew what needed to happen.

1058
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:40,580
特許經營權 特許經營權 特許經營權 特許經營權

1059
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:40,580
Franchising, franchise, franchise, franchise.

1060
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,680
特許經營權

1061
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,680
Franchise.

1062
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,700
我們已經試過了

1063
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,700
We already tried.

1064
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:55,100
五家店 三個在南加州 一個在三塊饅頭 一個在鳳凰城

1065
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:55,100
5. Three in Southern California one in Sacramento and one in Phoenix

1066
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,310
也只會有這些店

1067
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,310
And that's all there will ever be.

1068
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,450
為什麼？

1069
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,450
Why?

1070
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,750
兩個字

1071
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,750
Two words:

1072
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,660
品控

1073
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,660
Quality Control.

1074
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,110
那麼遠已經很難把控質量標準

1075
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,110
It's almost impossible to enforce standards from afar.

1076
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,300
店多了很糟糕

1077
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,300
Places were a mess.

1078
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,440
骯髒的廚房 不同的菜單

1079
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,440
Filthy kitchens, inconsistent menus

1080
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,320
三塊饅頭店就銷售玉米卷餅

1081
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,320
Sacramento was selling burritos.

1082
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:14,580
看到你的創造被如此濫用

1083
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:14,580
To watch your precious creation be mismanaged like that

1084
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,260
你的名字

1085
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,260
Your name.

1086
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,020
Mac字樣被放到了醫院

1087
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,020
Put Mac in the hospital.

1088
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,340
噢 那你可以找個監管員

1089
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,340
Well, so you put somebody in charge of supervising.

1090
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,410
試過了

1091
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,410
We did.

1092
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,390
那麼 發生什麼了？

1093
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,390
So, what happened?

1094
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,910
他做的非常差

1095
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,910
He obviously didn't do a great job.

1096
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,320
你再僱傭其他人啊 用更好的人

1097
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,320
So you hire somebody else, get somebody better.

1098
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:34,530
我們精力有限 讓這裏變得更好就已經很費勁了

1099
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:34,530
Our energies are better spent making this place the best it can possibly be.

1100
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:37,410
所以 擁有一家好店要強於五十幾家孬店

1101
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:37,410
It's better to have one great restaurant than 50 mediocre ones.

1102
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,550
當然、當然、當然

1103
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1104
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,130
我還是認為僱傭正確的員工...

1105
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,130
I still think you hire the right guy...

1106
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,640
雷 我們不感興趣

1107
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,640
Ray, we're not interested.

1108
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,670
額 我認為你們忽略了一些東西

1109
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,670
Look, I think you boys are missing something here that is...

1110
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,500
我告訴你 你應該...

1111
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,500
I tell You, You gotta...

1112
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,050
這些...

1113
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,050
something here...

1114
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,140
哇 那是什麼？

1115
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,140
Wuh... what is that?

1116
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,430
一個概念

1117
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,430
A concept.

1118
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,090
哦

1119
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,090
Huh.

1120
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,700
那些是什麼？

1121
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,700
What are those?

1122
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:57,600
噢 是當你開車路過時很顯眼的設計

1123
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:57,600
Oh, it's a way to make the place stand out when you're driving by.

1124
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,940
金色拱門

1125
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,940
The golden arches

1126
00:27:59,210 --> 00:27:59,890
我這樣命名

1127
00:27:59,210 --> 00:27:59,890
I call them.

1128
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,100
金色拱門

1129
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,100
The golden arches

1130
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,100
誰想到這個點子

1131
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,100
Who thought of that?

1132
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,730
那完全是迪克的一些魔幻想法

1133
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,730
Oh that's some pure Dick magic right there.

1134
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,120
你是否做過任何一家像這樣的店？

1135
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,120
Did You ever build one like that?

1136
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,250
只有一個

1137
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,250
Just one

1138
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,070
鳳凰城

1139
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,070
Phoenix

1140
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:48,810
17號公路 鳳凰城 南出口 亞利桑那州

1141
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,700
阿靈頓海茨 伊利諾伊州

1142
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,110
埃塞爾？

1143
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,110
Ethel?

1144
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,440
在這裏

1145
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,440
In here.

1146
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,820
親愛的 我看到了一家餐廳

1147
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,820
Oh boy I saw a restaurant.

1148
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,230
我此生從沒看到過這樣的餐廳

1149
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,230
I've never seen a restaurant like this in my life.

1150
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,870
他們有能全自動化的... 系統

1151
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,870
They got this fully automated... system.

1152
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,190
稱之為高速系統

1153
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,190
It's called the speedy system.

1154
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,120
嗯吶

1155
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,120
Mmm hmm.

1156
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:06,780
名字起的很好 因為真的很快速

1157
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:06,780
Which is a good name for it because man it is speedy.

1158
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:13,050
我告訴你 這就像是從 亨利·福特 或某種思想中跳出的事情

1159
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:13,050
I tell You, it's like something sprung from the mind of Henry Ford or something.

1160
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:14,850
這是革命嗎？

1161
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:14,850
It's revolutionary?

1162
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:15,590
這是革命

1163
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:15,590
It's revolutionary.

1164
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,720
恰如其分 這就是革命

1165
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,720
That's exactly what it is, it's revolutionary.

1166
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,530
你想投資？

1167
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,530
And you wanna invest in it?

1168
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,290
我不知道

1169
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,290
I don't know.

1170
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,820
我不知道 還不確認

1171
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,820
I don't know. I'm not sure yet.

1172
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,550
我只知道現在想參與進去

1173
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,550
I just know I want to be a part of it.

1174
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:25,740
親愛的

1175
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:25,740
Boy.

1176
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:26,950
我們開始吧

1177
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:26,950
So here we go.

1178
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,100
你這句話什麼意思？

1179
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,100
What do you mean by that?

1180
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,940
蠟杯子、折疊器、多用途攪拌機

1181
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,940
Wax cups, folding nooks, multimixers.

1182
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,320
又一個新的目標

1183
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,320
A new idea to chase.

1184
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,080
這些東西蓋起了我們的房子

1185
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,080
Those things put a roof over our heads.

1186
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,050
至少是我的

1187
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,050
At least over mine.

1188
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,310
為什麼是你的？

1189
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,310
What do you mean over yours?

1190
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,270
是蓋了我們的房子

1191
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,270
Over our heads...

1192
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,510
但這確實是個好房子

1193
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,510
It's a good roof Ray.

1194
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,310
是個好家

1195
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,310
It's a good house.

1196
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,930
是個好的生活方式 你不會太忙碌

1197
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,930
It's a good life if you weren't too busy to live it.

1198
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,430
我們一年至少能出去俱樂部兩次以上

1199
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,430
We could go to the club more than twice a year.

1200
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,050
天吶 它們就開在街角

1201
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,050
Christ, just take a walk around the block together.

1202
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,500
是時候享受一些生活 不再逆風飛揚了

1203
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,500
Isn't time to enjoy a little and stop chasing your tail?

1204
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,760
什麼時候你才能滿足你的要求？

1205
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,760
When's enough gonna be enough for you?

1206
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,000
真心話？

1207
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,000
Honestly?

1208
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,300
也許永遠不會

1209
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,300
Probably never.

1210
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,500
我為什麼不在其他人還沒做前 解決這個問題？

1211
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,500
Why should I settle when other men won't?

1212
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,540
我不知道 雷

1213
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,540
I don't know Ray.

1214
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,640
也許我有一個還有些願景的妻子

1215
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,640
Maybe if I had a wife that had an ounce a vision.

1216
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,880
給我一些支持

1217
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,880
Showed me an ounce of support.

1218
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,420
對不起 用錯詞了

1219
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,420
Sorry, wrong word.

1220
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,230
除了支持你 我其它什麼都沒做過

1221
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,230
I've done nothing but support you.

1222
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,910
額 很對不起

1223
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,910
Oh look, I'm sorry

1224
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,260
跑上跑下 減少儲蓄 幫你計劃...

1225
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,260
Ups, downs, dwindling savings, your schemes...

1226
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,150
你是對的

1227
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,150
You're right.

1228
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,980
約翰遜先生 你是否熟悉那個關於先有雞還是先有蛋的概念

1229
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,980
Are You familiar with the concept of the chicken and the egg Mr. Johnson

1230
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,270
因為我認為適用於這裏的情況

1231
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,270
because I think that's applicable here.

1232
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:55,930
嘿 迪克

1233
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:55,930
Hey Dick

1234
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,410
這傢伙究竟怎麼了？

1235
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,410
What is it with this guy?

1236
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,370
為了你的國家

1237
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,370
Do it for your country.

1238
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:03,740
什麼？

1239
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:03,740
What?

1240
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:10,810
如果你們兩個不想開放特許經營權 那麼無所謂

1241
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:10,810
If you boys don't want to franchise for yourselves, that's fine...

1242
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,930
為了你的國家

1243
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,930
Do it for your country.

1244
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,140
為了美國

1245
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,140
Do it for America.

1246
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,860
你知道嗎？我開過了很多城鎮

1247
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,860
You know what, I drove through a lot of towns.

1248
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,100
很多小鎮

1249
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,100
A lot of small towns.

1250
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,390
一般講 它們都有兩個東西

1251
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,390
And they all had two things in common

1252
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:29,250
他們有法院 他們有教堂

1253
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:29,250
They had a courthouse and they had a church.

1254
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,930
教堂的頂部有十字架

1255
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,930
On top of the church, got a cross

1256
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:35,160
而法院的頂部飄著旗子

1257
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:35,160
and on top of the courthouse they have a flag.

1258
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,620
旗子、十字架 十字架、旗子

1259
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,620
Flags, crosses, crosses flags.

1260
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,850
開過的時候我不能停止關於這家如此驚人的餐廳的思考

1261
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,850
Driving around I just cannot stop thinking about this tremendous restaurant.

1262
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,290
冒著褻瀆的風險

1263
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,290
Now at the risk of sounding blasphemous

1264
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,090
請原諒我

1265
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,090
forgive me.

1266
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:52,570
這些拱門與這些建築有很多共通之處

1267
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:52,570
Those arches have a lot in common with those buildings.

1268
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,960
建築頂端有十字架 什麼意思？

1269
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,960
A building with a cross on top, what is that?

1270
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:56,740
這是人們聚集的地方

1271
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:56,740
It's a gathering place

1272
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,310
體面和健康的人聚集在一起

1273
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,310
where decent wholesome people come together

1274
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:03,630
他們共同享受著美國國旗保護下的價值觀

1275
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:03,630
and they share values protected by that American flag.

1276
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:08,440
可以說 那些被美麗拱門所環繞的建築

1277
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:08,440
It could be said that that beautiful building flanked by those arches...

1278
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:12,080
或多或少表示了同樣的事情

1279
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:12,080
signifies more or less the same thing.

1280
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,540
我不是僅僅說：「裏面有漢堡美食」

1281
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,540
It doesn't just say, "Delicious hamburgers inside"

1282
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,190
它表示了家庭 它表示了社區

1283
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,190
They signify family. It signifies community.

1284
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:22,230
這是美國人聚在一起吃麵包的地方

1285
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:22,230
It's a place where Americans come together to break bread.

1286
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,560
我來告訴你

1287
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,560
I am telling you

1288
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,800
麥當勞將會成為

1289
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,800
McDonald's can be

1290
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,950
新一代的美國教堂

1291
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,950
the new American church.

1292
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,360
給人們的身體和靈魂供養

1293
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,360
Feeding bodies and feeding souls

1294
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,620
而且不僅僅是週日營業 朋友

1295
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,620
and it ain't just open on Sundays, boys.

1296
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,990
七天都營業

1297
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,990
It's open 7 days a week.

1298
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,640
十字架 旗幟

1299
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,640
Crosses Flags

1300
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,070
拱門

1301
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,070
Arches.

1302
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:02,610
給我們幾分鐘 雷

1303
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:02,610
Give us a minute Ray.

1304
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:04,470
當然

1305
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:04,470
Sure.

1306
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,200
我不知道

1307
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,200
I don't know.

1308
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,940
這是你的夢

1309
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,940
This is your dream.

1310
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,960
這比你的夢還要偉大

1311
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,960
It's bigger than your dream.

1312
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,070
拱門 你的拱門

1313
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,070
Arches. Your arches...

1314
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,420
橫跨美國

1315
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,420
coast to coast.

1316
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,180
我不能讓你再經歷一次

1317
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,180
I can't put you through that again.

1318
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,880
我知道你多想得到這個

1319
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,880
I know how bad you want this

1320
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,440
你也應該擁有這個

1321
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,440
and you should have it.

1322
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,750
你的糖尿病

1323
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,750
Your diabetes

1324
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:26,270
上次

1325
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:26,270
Last time...

1326
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,570
我們換種方法做事

1327
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,570
We'll do things differently.

1328
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:28,870
我們從錯誤中吸取經驗

1329
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:28,870
We'll learn from our mistakes.

1330
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,540
如何 怎樣？

1331
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,540
How so?

1332
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,860
更嚴格的管住所有事情

1333
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,860
Keep a tighter leash on everything.

1334
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:31,910
完全監督

1335
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:31,910
Complete oversight.

1336
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,080
所有的變化都要經由我們同意

1337
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,080
Every change goes through us.

1338
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,690
誰說他能聽進去？

1339
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,690
Who says he's gonna listen?

1340
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,540
我們讓他聽進去

1341
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,540
We'll make him listen.

1342
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,290
做好合同

1343
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,290
Draw up a contract.

1344
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,460
明晰一切 白紙黑字

1345
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,460
Clear as day. Black and white.

1346
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:58,980
好

1347
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:58,980
Fine.

1348
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,160
好

1349
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,160
Fine.

1350
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:08,680
好

1351
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:08,680
Fine.

1352
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,070
好

1353
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,070
Fine.

1354
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:20,830
好

1355
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:20,830
Fine.

1356
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,000
讓我們開始工作吧

1357
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,000
Let's get to work boys.

1358
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:41,950
第一步是什麼？

1359
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:41,950
What's the first step?

1360
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,600
交給我來辦

1361
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,600
Just leave that to me.

1362
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,080
我們是一個充滿活力的快速成長的公司

1363
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,080
We are a dynamic fast- growing company

1364
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,470
我們準備在全國各地主要道路經營

1365
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,470
and we're poised to make major in- roads nationally

1366
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,880
此外這裏是我們強大的立足點

1367
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,880
So in addition to giving us a real strong foothold

1368
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,470
就這裏 中西部

1369
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,470
right here in the Midwest

1370
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,400
這些標識了的地點和服務項目

1371
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,400
to display it's location with service

1372
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:58,080
是一種對其他特許經營者的誘惑 如果他們願意

1373
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:58,080
as a kind of a lure for other franchises if you will.

1374
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,350
這是什麼？

1375
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,350
What are those?

1376
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:01,900
什麼？

1377
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:01,900
What are?

1378
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,430
這裏

1379
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,430
Those.

1380
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:07,440
讓我看看

1381
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:07,440
Let me see

1382
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,610
噢 那些 是的

1383
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,610
oh those, yeah...

1384
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,310
那就是我們和其他人不同的小小區分方法

1385
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,310
That's just my little way of separating us from the rest of the pack.

1386
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,850
你喜歡嗎？

1387
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,850
You like them?

1388
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,260
我稱之為黃金拱門

1389
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,260
I call them The Golden Arches.

1390
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,090
你看起來眼熟

1391
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,090
You look familiar.

1392
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:18,960
我們之前見過嗎？

1393
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:18,960
Have we met before?

1394
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,250
我認為沒有... 沒見過

1395
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,250
I don't think so... no.

1396
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,530
我想我能回憶起

1397
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,530
I think I'd remember that.

1398
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:25,100
如果你不介意 請用心閱讀

1399
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:25,100
Peruse the inside of your if you don't mind.

1400
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,020
看這裏 嗯

1401
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,020
Take a look... yeah,

1402
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:26,860
讀這裏

1403
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:26,860
read that.

1404
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,690
折疊器

1405
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,690
The fold- a- nook.

1406
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,620
就像是在你廚房的折疊床

1407
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,620
It's like a Murphy bed for your kitchen.

1408
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:32,770
是嗎？

1409
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:32,770
Huh?

1410
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:40,200
還是看藍圖吧 這裏

1411
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:40,200
Take look at the blueprints, here we are.

1412
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:41,990
我們在這裏製作的

1413
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:41,990
We had those done locally.

1414
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,690
是的 我忘不了這張臉

1415
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,690
Yeah, I never forget a face.

1416
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:51,990
獨特、原創、全新創作

1417
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:51,990
Unique, original, totally innovative

1418
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,980
在整個食品行業中

1419
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,980
There's nothing like this. Nothing.

1420
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,820
沒有一家這樣做

1421
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,820
In the entire food service sector.

1422
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,640
漂亮的冊子

1423
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,640
Nice brochure

1424
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,140
專業製作

1425
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,140
professionally done.

1426
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:02,610
我們見過嗎？

1427
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:02,610
Have we met?

1428
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,840

00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,840
The paper cup guy.

1430
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,160
是的

1431
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,160
Yeah.

1432
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,710
那是很久以前了

1433
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,710
That was a long time ago.

1434
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,270
那真是很久以前了

1435
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,270
That was a long time ago...

1436
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:13,930
你怎麼看？

1437
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:13,930
What do you think?

1438
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,480
我不知道

1439
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,480
I don't know.

1440
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:19,420
這有些...

1441
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:19,420
There's...

1442
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:22,960
看...

1443
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:22,960
Look...

1444
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,300
我想和你權衡一下

1445
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,300
I'm gonna level with You

1446
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:28,830
額...

1447
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:28,830
uh...

1448
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,800
我需要這個

1449
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,800
I need this one.

1450
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,340
你是否認為...

1451
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,340
Do You think...

1452
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:36,350
有任何您能幫我脫困的點嗎？

1453
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:36,350
Is there anything you can do to help me out?

1454
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:36,880
我要告訴你

1455
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:36,880
I'll tell You what.

1456
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:38,690
把你介紹給我的一個同事

1457
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:38,690
Let me refer You to one of my colleagues.

1458
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,030
這個人也許正是你所需

1459
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,030
Somebody who may be better suited to meet your needs.

1460
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:43,910
謝謝你

1461
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:43,910
Thank you.

Alright.

當然 在我們放貸之前需要到你家進行評估

Of course we'll need an appraisal on your home before we can issue funds.

1484
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,080
做對事

1485

Be right.

1486
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,520
做對一次事

1487
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,520
Just be right one time.

1488
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:58,940
一次就行

1489

What about the fire department?

1496
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,720
你是否獲得了道路設計的許可證？

1497
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,720
Did you get the approval for the driveway design?

1498
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,560
昨天給他們留言了

1499
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,560
Left a message with them yesterday.

1500
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,730
挖掘許可證？

1501
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,730
Excavation permits?

1502
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,400
我今天將和他們碰面

1503
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,400
I'm meeting with them today.

1504
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:12,370
好的

1505
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:12,370
All right.

1506
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,530
嘿！聖貝納迪諾那邊怎麼樣了？

1507
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,530
Hey, what's going on with San Bernardino by the way?

1508
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,640
我剛和迪克交談 他說他們正在處理

1509
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,640
I just spoke to Dick, he said they're working on it.

1510
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:21,780
他們正在處理

1511
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:21,780
They're working on it...

1512
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,460
就是這麼答覆的

1513
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,460
That's what he said.

1514
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,490
是雷·克羅克

1515
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,490
Ray Kroc on the line.

1516
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:31,530
嗨！雷

1517
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:31,530
Hi Ray.

1518
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,360
你 你們倆快要殺了我

1519
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,360
Boy, you boys are killing me.

1520
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,540
到底怎麼了？

1521
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,540
What's the old up?

1522
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,200
我準備了2周的地面

1523
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,200
I break ground in 2 weeks.

1524
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:39,880
這些事情需要時間 你提出了很多變動

1525
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:39,880
These things take time and you're proposing substantial alterations.

1526
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,280
我增加了一個地下室和一個爐子

1527
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,280
I'm adding a basement and a furnace

1528
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:42,720
就這些

1529
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:42,720
that's all.

1530
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,280
我需要我的建築師審核它

1531
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,280
We need our architect to thoroughly review it

1532
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:47,510
確保一切安全 符合規定

1533
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:47,510
and make sure everything is safe and up to code.

1534
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:48,780
好的 那麼他看過了嗎？

1535
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:48,780
Fine, has he seen it yet?

1536
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,020
他究竟看過了沒有？

1537
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,020
Has he taken a look at it?

1538
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,170
誠實講 我不確認

1539
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,170
I'm not sure to be honest.

1540
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,640
23號 我將使用推土機

1541
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,640
I've got bulldozers rolling up on the 23rd.

1542
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,330
又不是我訂的計劃

1543
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,330
I'm not the one who scheduled that.

1544
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:58,580
雷 我需要你緩口氣

1545
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:58,580
Ray, I need you to take a breath.

1546
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,480
緩口氣

1547
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,480
Take a breath...

1548
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,970
你知道我要花費多少錢嗎？

1549
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,970
Do you realize what it's going to cost me if I have to push?

1550
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:04,080
希望不會到這一步

1551
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:04,080
Hopefully it won't come to that.

1552
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,010
中西部的每家餐廳都有地下室和爐子

1553
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,010
Every restaurant in the Midwest has a basement and a furnance.

1554
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,030
這是標配

1555
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,030
This is standard stuff.

1556
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:11,650
我明白 但是標在建築上的是我們的名字

1557
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:11,650
I understand, but it's our name on that building.

1558
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:15,290
上帝禁止樓層使人受傷或更慘

1559
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:15,290
God forbid the floor caves in and people get hurt or worse

1560
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,240
只是因為我們錯過了一些設計缺陷

1561
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,240
because of some design flaw we missed.

1562
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,770
讓我們緩幾分鐘

1563
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,770
Let's just slow down a minute

1564
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,500
確保做對事情

1565
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,500
and make sure it's done right.

1566
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,310
這就是你的高速系統啊？

1567
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,310
So much for the speedy system, huh?

1568
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,390
他剛掛了你的電話？

1569
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,390
Did he just hang up on you?

1570
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:29,790
是的

1571
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:29,790
Yes.

1572
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,060
除非是我們自己的電話系統壞了

1573
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,060
Unless we got violently disconnected.

1574
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:33,810
好吧

1575
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:33,810
Okay

1576
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,260
他會好的

1577
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,260
He'll be fine.

1578
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,510
哪裏是前部？讓我看看

1579
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,510
Where's the front of the uh... show me.

1580
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:45,610
好的

1581
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:45,610
Alright.

1582
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,040
請確保窗戶足夠大

1583
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,040
Just make sure the windows are big enough

1584
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,470
無論哪邊來的顧客都能夠看到餐廳裏面

1585
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,470
so that the customer can look in to the restaurant all the way to the kitchen.

1586
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:50,600
看起來不對

1587
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:50,600
Doesn't look right

1588
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:51,350
讓我們看看

1589
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:51,350
Let's see this

1590
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:51,680
雷

1591
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:51,680
Ray?

1592
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:52,100
什麼？

1593
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:52,100
What?

1594
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,000
我收到一封來自聖貝納迪諾的信件

1595
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,000
We got a letter from San Bernardino.

1596
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:55,240
讀給我

1597
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:55,240
Read it to me.

1598
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:01,400
親愛的雷 感謝你分享你與可口可樂打交道的想法

1599
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:01,400
Dear Ray, thank you for your letter sharing your idea to strike a deal with Coca- Cola

1600
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:04,590
贊助位於德斯普蘭斯的新店菜單牌

1601
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:04,590
to sponsor menu boards at the new Des Plaines location.

1602
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:07,120
確實是個有趣的概念

1603
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:07,120
An intriguing notion indeed.

1604
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,210
正如你所說的

1605
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,210
As you rightly point out

1606
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,280
這種佈置將提供穩定的到店收入源

1607
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,280
such an arrangement would provide a steady source

1608
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:14,120
而無需額外的人工成本

1609
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:14,120
of revenue to the store at no additional labor cost.

1610
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:15,330
然而

1611
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:15,330
However

1612
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:16,480
然而？

1613
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:16,480
However?

1614
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:17,730
然而些什麼？

1615
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:17,730
However what?

1616
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:21,990
然而 這些概念超出了我們的核心理念

1617
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:21,990
However this is a concept that goes beyond our core beliefs.

1618
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:23,080
麥當勞所創立時的理念

1619
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:23,080
McDonald's was founded with

1620
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:27,200
以家庭為主的理念 而不是絕對的商業運營

1621
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:27,200
the idea of families and not strict commerce.

1622
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:27,890
這幫混蛋

1623
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:27,890
Son of a bitch.

1624
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,120
他們不明白自己在說些什麼

1625
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,120
They don't know what they're talking about.

1626
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,990
以及其它理由

1627
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,990
And so on and so on

1628
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:34,180
先生們

1629
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:34,180
There You go gentlemen.

1630
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:35,680
回去工作

1631
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:35,680
Back to work.

1632
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:36,400
讓我來解釋

1633
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:36,400
Let me explain.

1634
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:39,000
簡單化 直接說底線

1635
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:39,000
Be real small, right alone the bottom.

1636
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:39,820
非常謹慎

1637
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:39,820
Very discreet.

1638
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,390
把菜單變成廣告

1639
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,390
We're just not comfortable with the notion

1640
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:43,980
這讓我們感覺非常不適

1641
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:43,980
of turning our menu into an advertisement.

1642
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,540
看清楚 這不是廣告

1643
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,540
See, it's not an ad,

1644
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,750
這是贊助商

1645
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,750
it's sponsorship.

1646
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,060
令人討厭

1647
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,060
It's distasteful.

1648
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:48,910
這是白來的錢

1649
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:48,910
It's free money!

1650
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:51,200
有很多種快速賺錢的方法

1651
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:51,200
There are plenty of things we could do to make a quick buck.

1652
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,210
但並不是說我們應該這樣做

1653
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,210
But that doesn't mean we should.

1654
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:53,600
很多餐館都這樣做

1655
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:53,600
Lots of restaurants do this.

1656
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,270
但我們不

1657
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,270
Well we don't.

1658
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:54,980
為何不？

1659
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:54,980
Why not?

1660
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,190
因為我對那種粗魯的商業主義

1661
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,190
Because I have no interest in indulging

1662
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:59,080
絲毫不感興趣

1663
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:59,080
in that sort of crass commercialism.

1664
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,210
這不是麥當勞

1665
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,210
It's not McDonald's.

1666
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:02,390
沒想到我是在和好鬥者合作

1667
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:02,390
I didn't realize I was parterning with a beatnik.

1668
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,940
你需要知道 我是共和黨的人

1669
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,940
I'll have you know I'm a card carrying Republican!

1670
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,340
是的 你可以欺騙我

1671
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,340
Yeah, well you coulda fooled me.

1672
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,010
他又掛了

1673
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,010
He hung up again.

1674
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:11,860
他只是有些興奮

1675
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:11,860
Well he's just a little excitable,

1676
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,170
就這樣

1677
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,170
that's all.

1678
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,490
這樣頭腦發熱

1679
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,490
A hothead like that,

1680
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,140
你不知道他適合幹些什麼

1681
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,140
you don't know what he's capable of.

1682
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,510
這都只是嚇唬 迪克

1683
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,510
It's all bluster Dick.

1684
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:22,720
他是刀子嘴 豆腐心

1685
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:22,720
His bark is worse than his bite.

1686
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,710
那是內維爾·張伯倫說的

1687
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,710
That's what Neville Chamberlain said.

1688
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,540
他會放下的

1689
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,540
He'll relax

1690
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:26,950
給他一些時間

1691
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:26,950
Give him some time.

1692
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,600
德斯普蘭斯 伊利諾伊州

1693
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,570
你在做什麼？幹活去！

1694
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,570
What are doing, come on!

1695
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:37,090
有時間休息就有時間做清潔

1696
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:37,090
There's time to lean, there's time to clean.

1697
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:37,740
開始

1698
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:37,740
Let's go.

1699
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,900
帽子戴正

1700
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,900
Put that hat on straight.

1701
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:46,340
四百度 對吧？

1702
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:46,340
400 degrees, right?

1703
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,310
好孩子 幹得好

1704
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,310
That a boy, way to work.

1705
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:48,940
不錯

1706
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:48,940
Nice.

1707
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:51,670
嘿、嘿、嘿這裏只有一片酸黃瓜

1708
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:51,670
Hey,hey,hey there's one pickle on there.

1709
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:52,760
所有的麵包都要有兩片

1710
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:52,760
2 pickles on all the buns.

1711
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,930
所有的麵包都要有兩片

1712
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,930
2 pickles on all of them.

1713
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:54,890
別 不要

1714
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:54,890
Don't... don't.

1715
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:56,100
看好了

1716
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:56,100
Look watch.

1717
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:57,210
這樣翻面

1718
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:57,210
Flip them like that.

1719
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:58,510
真的翻面並向下壓一次

1720
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:58,510
Really turn them over and then press them one time.

1721
00:44:58,510 --> 00:44:59,690
那個太生了

1722
00:44:58,510 --> 00:44:59,690
And that one's too pink.

1723
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,590
收到 好的

1724
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,590
There, all right.

1725
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,750
等一下 你 做的這些

1726
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,750
Wait... and you... get these...

1727
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:10,900
真太棒了

1728
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:10,900
Pretty damn good.

1729
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,140
你叫什麼？

1730
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,140
What's your name?

1731
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,740
弗雷德·特納 先生

1732
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,740
未來的麥當勞CEO

1733
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,740
Fred Turner sir.

1734
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:15,140
幹得好

1735
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:15,140
Nice work.

1736
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:16,350
弗雷德·特納

1737
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:16,350
Fred Turner.

1738
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:17,840
弗雷德·特納

1739
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:17,840
Fred Turner.

1740
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:04,760
對不起

1741
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:04,760
I'm sorry.

1742
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,430
我知道我一直忽視了你

1743
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,430
I know I've been neglecting you.

1744
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,520
明天怎麼樣？

1745
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,520
What do you say tomorrow

1746
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,850
我們一起去俱樂部晚餐

1747
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,850
we go to supper at the club?

1748
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,780
真的？

1749
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,780
Really?

1750
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:30,370
真的

1751
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:30,370
Really.

1752
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,930
大家看小貓帶什麼來了

1753
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,930
Well look what the cat dragged in.

1754
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:36,790
嗨 大家好

1755
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:36,790
Hey everybody.

1756
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,350
嗨 嗨

1757
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,350
Hi there. Hey.

1758
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:38,790
你好嗎？

1759
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:38,790
How are You?

1760
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:39,910
晚上好 陌生人

1761
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:39,910
Good evening stranger.

1762
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:46,000
這在第14個球道的左邊

1763
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:46,000
This is on the left side of the 14th fairway.

1764
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,030
我用了三號木球桿

1765
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,030
And I use a 3 wood.

1766
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:47,730
嗯

1767
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:47,730
Hmm.

1768
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:48,580
一擊完成

1769
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:48,580
Hit it clean.

1770
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,810
我聽說阿卡普爾科是聖地

1771
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,810
I hear Acapulco is divine.

1772
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:52,180
埃塞爾 你喜歡哪裏？

1773
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:52,180
Where do you like Ethel?

1774
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:54,370
哦... 西班牙

1775
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:54,370
Um... Spain.

1776
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:55,500
西班牙？

1777
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:55,500
Spain?

1778
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:57,690
太棒了 那裏怎麼樣？

1779
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:57,690
Wonderful. How was it?

1780
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,030
哦 我只是說我想去那裏

1781
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,030
Oh no, I mean I'm thinking about it.

1782
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:01,790
哦 你從來沒去過

1783
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:01,790
Oh you haven't been.

1784
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:03,780
我們正在夢想一個旅程

1785
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:03,780
Well we're dreaming up a trip.

1786
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:04,820
對嗎？

1787
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:04,820
Right?

1788
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:06,790
不錯

1789
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:06,790
Great

1790
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:07,600
是的

1791
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:07,600
Yeah.

1792
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:09,270
哈哈哈

1793
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:09,270
Ha ha ha

1794
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,080
雷 你玩的怎麼樣？近來？

1795
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,080
How's your game Ray? Lately?

1796
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:14,400
根本沒玩

1797
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:14,400
Non- existent.

1798
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:16,150
你知道 把控我自己

1799
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:16,150
I know, been holding myself.

1800
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:16,960
不開玩笑

1801
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:16,960
No kidding.

1802
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:18,510
哈哈 是的

1803
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:18,510
Ha ha, yeah.

1804
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:21,730
我近日確實曾打進洞

1805
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:21,730
I did hit a hole in one of a resort recently though.

1806
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:27,320
我正在做一個絕對、絕對有趣的商業項目

1807
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:27,320
I came across a really, really interesting business opportunity.

1808
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,380
絕對有趣

1809
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,380
Really interesting.

1810
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,480
你們絕對想分一杯羹

1811
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,480
You boys are gonna want a piece of this.

1812
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,550
你又來了

1813
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,550
Here we go again.

1814
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:32,580
這次幹什麼 雷？

1815
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:32,580
What is it this time Ray?

1816
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:33,190
餐館

1817
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:33,190
Restaurant.

1818
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,530
新類型餐館

1819
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,530
New kind of restaurant.

1820
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:36,950
多新？

1821
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:36,950
New how?

1822
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,480
充滿了奶昔和折疊器的餐館？

1823
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,480
Restaurant filled with milkshakes and fold- a- nooks?

1824
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:43,500
哈 哈 哈...

1825
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:43,500
Ha ha ha...

1826
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:44,370
折疊器

1827
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:44,370
Fold- a- nook

1828
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:49,800
雷 我只是和你開個玩笑

1829
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:49,800
I'm just jokin' with you Ray.

1830
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:50,820
等一下傑克

1831
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:50,820
Hold on Jack.

1832
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:52,260
你應該聽他說完

1833
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:52,260
You should hear him out.

1834
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,300
這次不同

1835
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,300
This one's different.

1836
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:02,390
好吧 給我們多說說

1837
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:02,390
Well... do tell us more.

1838
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,410
我會的

1839
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,410
I will.

1840
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,160
這件事是美妙的

1841
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,160
This is a thing of beauty.

1842
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,670
完全自動化的廚房

1843
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,670
Fully automated kitchen

1844
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:11,040
之前我從未見到過

1845
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:11,040
likes of which I've never seen

1846
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:11,910
這是一次革命

1847
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:11,910
It's revolutionary.

1848
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:13,310
我們稱之為高速系統

1849
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:13,310
It's called the speedy system.

1850
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,500
我喜歡它是因為有特許經營權

1851
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,500
The thing I like about this is it's franchiseable.

1852
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,090
第一家餐廳已經開始經營

1853
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,090
The first one's already up and running.

1854
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:17,910
來我這裏看看

1855
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:17,910
Come over and take a look.

1856
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,590
我也許能為你們賺些錢

1857
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,590
It might make you boys a few dollars.

1858
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,020
你什麼都不用擔心

1859
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,020
You don't have to worry about a thing

1860
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,850
我們管理所有的事情

1861
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,850
we're in charge of everything

1862
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:29,760
所有的特許經營權都是一樣的

1863
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:29,760
and all these franchises look exactly the same.

1864
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,570
我從沒想過它會工作

1865
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,570
I'd have never thought it would work

1866
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,870
易如反掌 你只需支付特許經營權費用

1867
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,870
Easy as pie. You just pay the franchise fee

1868
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:38,750
我們管理其餘所有的事

1869
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:38,750
we take care of everything else.

1870
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:43,730
足夠近了

1871
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:43,730
Close enough!

1872
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:44,240
撿起來 騎兵

1873
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:44,240
Pick it up troop.

1874
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:45,790
好的 我們來簽約

1875
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:45,790
Alright, let's do this.

1876
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:49,770
簽好了？

1877
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:49,770
Got it?

1878
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:50,740
好了

1879
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:50,740
Ok.

1880
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,980
在這裏真的很高興

1881
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,980
Gonna be real happy here.

1882
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,230
恭喜

1883
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,230
Congratulations.

1884
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:57,800
好的

1885
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:57,800
Right.

1886
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:07,800
上個月三家新加盟店

1887
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:07,800
3 new franchises in the last month.

1888
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:08,970
做的不錯

1889
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:08,970
Well that's great.

1890
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:10,850
什麼？

1891
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:10,850
What?

1892
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:12,280
我不知道

1893
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:12,280
I don't know

1894
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:14,650
什麼？

1895
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:14,650
What?

1896
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:16,630
根據我們的經驗

1897
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:16,630
Don't you think maybe given our experience

1898
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,900
你不覺得這些發生的太快了嗎？

1899
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,900
that this is all happening a little too quickly?

1900
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:21,830
一次做這麼多

1901
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:21,830
If they all pop up at once

1902
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:23,530
他們怎麼保證品質符合標準？

1903
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:23,530
how's he gonna maintain standards?

1904
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:34,870
紹姆堡 伊利諾伊州

1905
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,660
狗娘養的

1906
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,660
Son of a bitch.

1907
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:24,110
一擊進洞 傑克

1908
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:24,110
Give it a whack, Jack.

1909
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:27,960
嘿！

1910
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:27,960
Hey!

1911
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:28,760
發生什麼了？

1912
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:28,760
What's goin' on here?

1913
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:29,520
看這個

1914
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:29,520
Look at this.

1915
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,680
這是什麼？啊？

1916
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,680
What is this? Huh?

1917
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,060
那是什麼？

1918
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,060
What is that?

1919
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,510
看起來是個漢堡

1920
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,510
It appears to be a hamburger.

1921
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:34,600
不是麥當勞漢堡 絕不是

1922
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:34,600
Not a McDonald's burger it's not.

1923
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,830
看這些番茄醬

1924
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,830
Look at all that ketchup.

1925
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:36,870
裏面有三片醃黃瓜

1926
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:36,870
And you got 3 pickles on

1927
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:37,590
而不是兩片

1928
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:37,590
there instead of 2

1929
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,370
看看這些生菜

1930
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,370
and look at that lettuce.

1931
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:40,490
真糟 傑克

1932
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:40,490
Really Jack

1933
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:41,730
我們能擇日再聊這些嗎？

1934
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:41,730
Can we talk about this another time?

1935
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:43,590
看看這些肉餅

1936
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:43,590
Look at this paddy itself.

1937
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:44,790
它熟的太過分了

1938
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:44,790
It is tragically over- cooked.

1939
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:45,370
悲劇

1940
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:45,370
Tragically.

1941
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:47,080
我不知道 雷 但對我說這樣看起來不錯

1942
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:47,080
I don't know Ray, it looks good to me.

1943
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,610
你懂什麼質量？

1944
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,610
What the hell do you know about quality?

1945
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,330
我也今天路過了你的餐館

1946
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,330
I was by your restaurant today too.

1947
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:51,080
是嗎?如何？

1948
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:51,080
Yeah? What about it?

1949
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,180
你在銷售玉米棒子

1950
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,180
You'v got corn on the cob

1951
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:53,240
你也在銷售炸雞

1952
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:53,240
You'v got fried chicken

1953
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,740
人們愛炸雞！

1954
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,740
People love fried chicken!

1955
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:55,360
他們愛？

1956
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:55,360
Do they?

1957
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,490
那就讓他們去賣炸雞的地方

1958
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,490
Well let them go somewhere where they serve fried chicken.

1959
00:50:57,870 --> 00:50:59,230
你的廚房很骯髒

1960
00:50:57,870 --> 00:50:59,230
And your kitchen is filthy.

1961
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:00,930
你們究竟有什麼毛病？

1962
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:00,930
What the hell's the matter with you guys?

1963
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:02,470
我不知道你的狀況 雷 但是我退休了

1964
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:02,470
I don't know about you Ray, but I'm retired.

1965
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:05,070
你說過這是我們放錢的好地方

1966
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:05,070
You said this was a good place for us to park our money.

1967
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:05,920
這是投資

1968
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:05,920
It's an investment.

1969
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,260
如果我找工作 我會找個廚師的工作

1970
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,260
If I'd have wanted a job I would have applied for a cook position.

1971
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,660
你在我的任一餐館都找不到廚師的工作

1972
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,660
You couldn't get a job as a cook in one of my restaurants.

1973
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:11,890
嘿！

1974
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:11,890
Hey!

1975
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,380
他怎麼了？

1976
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,380
What's his problem?

1977
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:15,390
他什麼也不是 就是屁股疼

1978
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:15,390
He's a pain in the ass is what he is.

1979
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:17,600
回到這裏 雷！

1980
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:17,600
Right back at You Ray!

1981
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:18,500
埃塞爾？

1982
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:18,500
Ethel?

1983
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:19,740
在這裏

1984
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:19,740
In here.

1985
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:20,360
嗨！

1986
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:20,360
Hi!

1987
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,240
雷

1988
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,240
Ray

1989
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:22,500
快些換衣服

1990
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:22,500
Hurry and get changed.

1991
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,710
晚餐預定在七點

1992
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,710
Dinner's called for 7:00.

1993
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,770
額 今晚我不能去俱樂部了

1994
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,770
Yeah, we're not going to the club tonight.

1995
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:29,380
等等 你取消了我們的晚餐？

1996
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:29,380
Wait, you cancelled our dinner?

1997
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:32,280
我取消了我們的合作

1998
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:32,280
I... cancelled our membership.

1999
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:33,360
什麼？

2000
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:33,360
What?

2001
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,750
和這些錯誤的小綠人

2002
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,750
With the wrong green people.

2003
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:36,640
他們根本不是我的菜

2004
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:36,640
They're not really our kind.

2005
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:38,940
你在說些什麼？

2006
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:38,940
What are you talking about?

2007
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:42,650
我已經失去了對這些富裕閒人的興趣

2008
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:42,650
I've lost interest in hobnobbing with the idle rich.

2009
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:44,300
富裕閒人是

2010
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:44,300
The idle rich.

2011
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:47,300
他們打高爾夫 喝雞尾酒

2012
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:47,300
You know, their golf, and their Rob Roy's.

2013
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,880
他們是如此的自滿和空洞

2014
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,880
They're so complacent and content.

2015
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:53,570
雷 請告訴我你在開玩笑

2016
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:53,570
Ray... please tell me you're joking.

2017
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:55,100
他們是我們的朋友

2018
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:55,100
These are our friends.

2019
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:56,330
是 我懂 我懂

2020
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:56,330
Now, I know, I know.

2021
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:57,310
你知道麼？

2022
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:57,310
You know what?

2023
00:51:58,450 --> 00:51:59,120
你和我

2024
00:51:58,450 --> 00:51:59,120
You and I

2025
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,950
我們能夠結識很多新朋友

2026
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,950
We can make a lot of new friends.

2027
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,600
一切都好 結識新朋友

2028
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,600
It's alright. Make new friends.

2029
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:07,340
你懂的 那些更適合我們的朋友

2030
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:07,340
Friends that are more suitable for us.You know?

2031
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:09,240
你也這樣想吧？

2032
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:09,240
Don't You think?

2033
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:12,740
請給我幾秒

2034
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:12,740
You know what? Give me one second?

2035
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:13,970
車庫讓我瘋狂了

2036
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:13,970
Garage is driving me crazy.

2037
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:17,180
我就去整理和清潔一下 然後

2038
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:17,180
Can I just go sweep it out and clean it up and then...

2039
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:20,050
穿好衣服 我帶你出去找些個地方吃

2040
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:20,050
put a nice dress, I'll take you out for something to eat.

2041
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:57,410
看一眼這個漂亮的鑲嵌金邊

2042
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:57,410
Just take a gander at this handsome, gold inlay.

2043
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:01,500
你告訴我這麼優秀的工藝值不值八塊九角五分錢？

2044
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:01,500
You telling me such spectacular craftsmanship isn't worth $8.95?

2045
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:02,740
但是我好不感興趣

2046
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:02,740
But I'm not interested.

2047
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:04,930
不感興趣聖經

2048
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:04,930
Not interested in the bible

2049
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:07,420
你不想讓它成為你家庭圖書館的珍藏嗎？

2050
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:07,420
sure to be the pride of your family's home library?

2051

瓊 你一定知道嫉妒是七宗罪之一

2052
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:12,170
As you no doubt know June, envy is one of the 7 deadly sins.

2053
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:15,350
當你的朋友們看到你的書架上有這麼美麗的皮革書時

2054
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:15,350
And that is just what your friends are going to be guilty of

2055
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:17,270
這就是你朋友們要犯下的罪

2056
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:17,270
when they see this leather- bound beauty on your bookshelf.

2057
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:19,410
先生 這是商業私有空間

2058
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:19,410
Sir, this is a private place of business.

2059
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:21,780
恐怕我必須要求你離開了

2060
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:21,780
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask You to leave.

2061
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,040
謝謝你的時間

2062

What's a Jew doing sellin' Catholic bibles?

2089
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:51,930

01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:38,250
在芝加哥你甚至不能重新續杯

2326
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:38,250
You can't even top that in Chicago.

2327
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:40,040
好了 我們不要在這裏亂七八糟

2328
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:40,040
Well, we don't mess around up here.

2329
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,540
我向廚師致敬 這好極了

2330
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,540
Well, my compliments to the chef, that's wonderful.

2331
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:43,970
我能給你做更好的

2332
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:43,970
I can do You one better.

2333
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:44,800
想見業主嗎？

2334
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:44,800
How about the owner?

2335
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:46,150
當然 為什麼不

2336
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:46,150
Sure, why in the hell not.

2337
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,930
羅裏 羅裏

2338
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,930

很高興見到你 吉米

2340
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:52,670

2342
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:53,490
Rollie, how are You?

2343
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:54,510
呵 不錯

2344
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:54,510
Ah, wonderful.

2345
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:56,680
羅裏·史密斯 雷·克羅克

2346
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:56,680
Rollie Smith, Ray Kroc.

Oh boy, I will tell you, that

2351
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,850
這家餐館真棒

2352
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,850
you got a hell of a restaurant here.

2353
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:01,660
你說的讚美才是真的讚美

2354
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:01,660
Well coming from you that's quite a compliment.

2355
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:03,160
我的面子讓我這樣做

2356
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:03,160
My reputation proceeds me.

2357
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:05,720
我十分崇拜

2358
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:05,720
I'm a great admirer.

2359
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,110

2362
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:08,280
Well I don't wanna interrupt.

2363

Have a seat.

2365
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:11,470
好吧 就幾分鐘

2366
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:11,470
Well maybe just a minute.

2367
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,450
這位是佛瑞德·特納 我的同事

2368
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,450
This is Fred Turner, my associate.

Welcome.

2371
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:15,950
牛排做的還行吧？

2372
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:15,950
Steaks cooked okay?

2373
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:16,620
簡直完美

2374
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:16,620
Excellent, perfect.

2375
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:20,360
我們的目標是發展到中西部以外地區

2376
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:20,360
Well our intention is to ah expand pretty far beyond the midwest

2377
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,280
我們還不會做這裏

2378
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,280
We're not gonna settle here.

2379
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:22,780
我們還不會

2380
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:22,780
We're not gonna...

2381

我們要衝出中西部

2382
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,160
We're gonna expand far beyond the Midwest...

2383
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:29,590
顯然 你在明尼阿波利斯擁有了溫暖且有愛心的家

2384
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:29,590
Well you've clearly got a warm and loving home here in Minneapolis.

2385
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,200
是的 看起來是的

2386
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,200
Yeah, so it seems.

2387
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,730
是的 這個鎮子對麥當勞來說還太小了

2388
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,730
Yeah, this town just can't get enough of McDonald's.

2389
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:35,110
先生 您的

2390

2397
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:41,920
事實上 我有足夠的熱情去支持另一個

2398
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:41,920
In fact, I'd say there's sufficient enthusiam to support another.

2399
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,250
第二個地方

2400
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,250
Second location.

2401
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,190

01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:46,940
I know the perfect person to own and operate it.

2405
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:47,970
你不說

2406
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:47,970
You don't say.

2407
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,380
這個人知道需要用什麼去打造一家偉大的餐館

2408
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,380
Somebody who knows what it takes to build a great restaurant.

2409
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,960
這個人擁有20年的飲食行業經驗

2410
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,960
Someone with more than 20 years in the food service industry.

01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:56,780
Me.

2415
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:57,390
你？

2416
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:57,390
You?

2417
01:01:58,960 --> 01:01:59,470
哦！

2418
01:01:58,960 --> 01:01:59,470
Oh!

2419
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:00,800
這太令人震驚了

2420
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:00,800

你是否熟悉Hennipen大道？

2426
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:08,110
Are you familiar with Hennipen Avenue?

2427
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:13,040
這是雙城區最繁忙的商業動脈

2428
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:13,040
It's one of the busiest commerical arteries in the whole Twin cities.

2429
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,340
最近有一個黃金地盤可以成交

2430
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,340
There's a prime site that's recently become available

2431
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:17,600

01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:38,540
Huh?

2445
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,070
你會在這裏待多久？

2446
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,070
How long are you in town?

2447
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,000
還不確認

2448
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,000
Not sure yet.

2449
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:44,280
先生們如果能給我片刻 我將非常榮幸的帶領大家

2450
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:44,280

2455
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,010
他知道如何拿到那片地

2456
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,010
He knows how to pick them.

2457
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:50,210
我說那塊地

2458
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:50,210
I mean this place

2459
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:51,990
足夠開餐館了

2460
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:51,990
There's enough room for the restaurant

2461
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:54,600
停車場 也許小朋友的遊樂場

2490
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:22,640
Oh, Jim's here in Minneapolis.

2491
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:23,540

2492
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:23,540

2493
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:25,460
還有 嗯 俄亥俄的 代頓

2494
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:25,460
And uh, got one in Dayton, Ohio.

2495
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:26,460
很好

2496
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:26,460
That's right.

2497
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:30,930
你一定是個盲目積極的人 克羅克先生

2498
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:30,930
You must be positively dizzy Mr. Kroc.

2499
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:31,880
請叫我 雷

2500
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:31,880
Please, call me Ray.

2501

業務在增長

2504
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:36,230
That's some growth.

2505
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:37,090
是啊

2506
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:37,090

2510
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:39,380
Yes sir.

是啊 我們做的不錯

2512
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:40,890
Yeah we're doin' good.

2513
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:43,240
你何時開始的？

2514
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:43,240
When did you start it?

2515
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,590
額 什麼意思？

2516
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,590
Uh, hmm? Sorry?

2517
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,400
哪年開始的麥當勞生意

2518
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,400
What year did you start McDonald's?

2519
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:50,790
哪年？

2520
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:50,790
The year?

2521
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:54,500
始於1954年

2522
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:54,500
I started it in 1954.

2523
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,280
真不一般

2524
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,280
Remarkable.

2525
01:03:58,690 --> 01:03:59,190
是

2526
01:03:58,690 --> 01:03:59,190
Yup.

2527
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:03,750
我該回去了

2528
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:03,750
Well, I should get back.

2529
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:04,530
回去

2530
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:04,530
Back?

2531
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:06,180
回到鋼琴那裏

2532
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:06,180
Yeah, to my piano.

2533
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:07,060
哦 當然

2534
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:07,060
Oh, of course.

2535
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:10,890
你最喜歡哪首歌？

2536
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:10,890
What's your favorite song?

2537
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:12,770
一直都喜歡的

2538
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:12,770
All- time favorite.

2539
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:14,440
《意外之財》

2540
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:14,440
Pennies From Heaven.

2541
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:15,950
《意外之財》

2542
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:15,950
Pennies From Heaven.

2543
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:20,080
棒極的女孩

2544
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:20,080
Great gal.

2545
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:20,700
是

2546
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:20,700
Yup.

2547
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:37,860
我曾經賣過鋼琴

2548
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:37,860
I sold pianos for a while

2549
01:04:40,690 --> 01:04:43,350
每當下雨的時候

2550
01:04:40,690 --> 01:04:43,350
Every time it rains

2551
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:47,750
天降意外之財

2552
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:47,750
it rains... pennies from heaven

2553
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:55,870
你難道不知道每片雲朵都有

2554
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:55,870
Don't you know each cloud contains

2555
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,420
天降之財

2556
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,420
pennies from heaven.

2557
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:05,930
你會發現你的財富掉下來

2558
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:05,930
You'll find your fortune falling

2559
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:09,480
佈滿全鎮

2560
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:09,480
all over town.

2561
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:10,430
聽起來很棒

2562
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:10,430
Sounds pretty good.

2563
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:19,190
請務必將你的雨傘 反打

2564
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:19,190
Be sure that your umbrella, is upside down

2565
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,560
用它們換來一包

2566
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,560
Trade them for a package of

2567
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:28,700
陽光與花朵

2568
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:28,700
sunshine and flowers

2569
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:34,660
若要獲心愛之物

2570
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:34,660
If you want the things you love

2571
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:38,570
必先沐浴

2572
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:38,570
you must have showers

2573
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:44,380
當你聽聞雷聲

2574
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:44,380
So when you hear it thunder

2575
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:47,470
莫至樹下

2576
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:47,470
don't run under a tree

2577
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:51,170
天將降財

2578
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:51,170
There will be pennies from heaven

2579
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:55,900
賜予你我

2580
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:55,900
for you and me

2581
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:25,650
雷

在這裏

2584
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:26,850
Down here.

2585
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:32,090
我有些適合你的人

2586
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:32,090
Uh, I think I've got some people for you.

2587
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,090
我遇到這對年輕人

2588
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,090
I met this young couple...

2589
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:35,410
非常堅強

2590
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:35,410
very committed.

2591
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:36,870
來自格倫維尤

2592
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:36,870
They're from Glenview.

2593
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:37,950
中學甜心

2594
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:37,950
High school sweethearts.

2595
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:39,170
結婚五年

2596
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:39,170
Married for 5 years.

2597
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:39,680
嗯

2598
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:39,680
En

2599
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,250
他們想要一起做些事情

2600
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,250
And they're looking for a business they can operate together.

2601
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:41,500
嗯

2602
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:41,500
Uh

2603
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,020
他們很興奮

2604
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,020
And they seem very excited.

2605
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:45,160
好的 忘掉這些吧 有新的變化

2606
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:45,160
Yeah, forget that. Everything's changed.

2607
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:46,490
想喝些什麼？

2608
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:46,490
You want a drink?

2609
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:48,010
不 什麼變化？

2610
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:48,010
No, changed how?

2611
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:51,830
忘掉芝加哥郊外 想的大些

2612
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:51,830
Forget the Chicago suburbs, think bigger.

2613
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:52,980
大些

2614
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:52,980
Bigger

2615
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:54,510
我不用在跟在別人後面

2616
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:54,510
I'm not chasing them anymore.

2617
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:56,440
他們要跟隨我

2618
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:56,440
They're chasing me now.

2619
01:06:59,170 --> 01:06:59,710
出差

2620
01:06:59,170 --> 01:06:59,710
The trip.

2621
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:00,560
我剛剛的出差

2622
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:00,560
The trip I'v just done.

2623
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:01,260
出差

2624
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:01,260
The trip.

2625
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:01,910
怎麼樣？

2626
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:01,910
How was it?

2627
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:02,850
太成功了

2628
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:02,850
Triumphant.

2629
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:05,140
簡直紅旗招展

2630
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:05,140
They were rolling out the red carpet.

2631
01:07:05,870 --> 01:07:06,930
親吻這枚戒指

2632
01:07:05,870 --> 01:07:06,930
And kissing this ring.

2633
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,310
他們開始求我開麥當勞

2634
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,310
They're begging me for McDonald's now.

2635
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,180
快 來一杯

2636
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,180
Here, have a drink.

2637
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:15,240
似乎不錯

2638
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:15,240
That's nice.

2639
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,580
當然是的

2640
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,580
Yeah, sure is.

2641
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:19,350
我確信

2642
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:19,350
I'm sure.

2643
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:25,980
好吧 萬歲

2644
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:25,980
Well, then, all hail

2645
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:27,340
雷蒙德主教一世

2646
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:27,340
Pope Raymond the 1st

2647
01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:31,250
真他喵對

2648
01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:31,250
Damn right.

2649
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:35,430
真他喵對極

2650
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:35,430
God damn right.

2651
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:40,320
雷

2652
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:40,320
Ray.

2653
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:41,230
在

2654
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:41,230
Yeah.

2655
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:43,500
我們有個小麻煩

2656
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:43,500
We have a small problem.

2657
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:44,940
稍等片刻

2658
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:44,940
Wait a minute

2659
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,730
我們怎麼可能幾乎沒有資本了？

2660
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,730
How can we be almost out of capital?

2661
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:48,280
這是你的收益

2662
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:48,280
Well, your revenue

2663
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:50,000
店面月結

2664
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:50,000
the monthly cut of the store's

2665
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,530
1.4%的債務

2666
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,530
1.4% of debt.

2667
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:52,640
1.4？

2668
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:52,640
1.4?

2669
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:52,990
是的

2670
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:52,990
Yeah.

2671
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,880
1.9 減去 麥克和迪克的一半分成

2672
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,880
1.9 minus Dick and Mac's half percent.

2673
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:00,890
麥當勞先生 雷·克羅克找您

2674
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:00,890
Mr. McDonald, Ray Kroc's on the line.

2675
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:05,270
很高興見到你

2676
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:05,270
Good to see you.

2677
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:09,970
嗨！雷

2678
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:09,970
Hi Ray.

2679
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:10,880
我想重新談判

2680
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:10,880
I wanna renegotiate.

2681
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,250
重新談判什麼？

2682
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,250
Renegotiate what?

2683
01:08:12,350 --> 01:08:12,890
我的條款

2684
01:08:12,350 --> 01:08:12,890
My deal.

2685
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:13,820
我那糟糕的條款

2686
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:13,820
My lousy deal.

2687
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:17,590
1.4 不夠我的每月運營 跟別說擴張了

2688
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:17,590
1.4 doesn't cover my monthly nut let alone drive expansion.

2689
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:18,940
雷 那些是合約

2690
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:18,940
Ray, those are the terms.

2691
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:19,500
但這不好

2692
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:19,500
It's not good enough.

2693
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:21,070
那大約是我們所得的三倍了

2694
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:21,070
It's almost triple our cut.

2695
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:22,890
是說你應該分的更多

2696
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:22,890
Well, you should be getting more too then

2697
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:23,250
不是嗎？

2698
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:23,250
Shouldn't You.

2699
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:24,560
我們不貪婪

2700
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:24,560
We're not greedy men.

2701
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,840
貪婪不能解決問題

2702
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,840
Greed has nothing to do with it.

2703
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:26,990
如果我有更多的錢

2704
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:26,990
If I had more money to work with

2705
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:29,200
我至少能擴大兩倍生意

2706
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:29,200
I could be growing this thing at twice the pace.

2707
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,610
我們無法投資當前的擴張

2708
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,610
We have no beef with the current rate of expansion.

2709
01:08:30,610 --> 01:08:31,430
我什麼都沒有

2710
01:08:30,610 --> 01:08:31,430
I have nothing.

2711
01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:32,900
在賓夕法尼亞州我一家店都沒有

2712
01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:32,900
Not one location in Pennsylvania.

2713
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:34,030
紐約也沒有

2714
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:34,030
Nothing in New York.

2715
01:08:34,050 --> 01:08:34,890
已經不錯了

2716
01:08:34,050 --> 01:08:34,890
All in good time.

2717
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:35,700
德州也沒有

2718
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:35,700
Nothing in Texas.

2719
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:36,820
我毫不懷疑都會有

2720
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:36,820
I have no doubt it'll come.

2721
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:39,200
我勒緊脖子為你們工作

2722
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:39,200
You know, I'm out here breaking my neck for you guys

2723
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,610
你正在做爆炸性的發展

2724
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,610
And you're doing a bang up job.

2725
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:43,320
打破現在的均衡 我會做的更好

2726
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:43,320
Well then I should be doing a hell of a lot better than just breaking even.

2727
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,350
我不知道該說什麼

2728
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,350
I don't know what to say.

2729
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:45,360
說你同意開始談判

2730
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:45,360
Say you'll renegotiate.

2731
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:45,910
我不能

2732
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:45,910
I can't.

2733
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:46,580
不能還是不願意？

2734
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:46,580
Can't or won't?

2735
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,800
提升你的收益比 對特許經營權不公平

2736
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,800
Upping your cut, it would be unfair to the franchisees.

2737
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:52,250
特許經營權運行的很好

2738
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:52,250
The franchisees are doing just fine

2739
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,770
我只是被淹沒其中

2740
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,770
I'm the one that's drowning here.

2741
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:57,330
雷 是你自主自願的簽約的

2742
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:57,330
You freely and willingly agreed to the terms of your deal, Ray.

2743
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:58,940
沒人用槍指著你

2744
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:58,940
Nobody put a gun to your head.

2745
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:00,230
4%

2746
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:00,230
4%

2747
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:00,910
不

2748
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:00,910
No.

2749
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:02,780
3.5%

2750
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:02,780
3.5%

2751
01:09:02,970 --> 01:09:03,380
雷

2752
01:09:02,970 --> 01:09:03,380
Ray

2753
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:04,030
什麼？

2754
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:04,030
What?

2755
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:04,560
不

2756
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:04,560
No.

2757
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,170
該死的！

2758
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,170
Goddamn it!

2759
01:09:13,030 --> 01:09:13,480
迪克

2760
01:09:13,030 --> 01:09:13,480
Dick

2761
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:15,870
他那邊感到痛苦嗎？

2762
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:15,870
Is he a pain in the rear?

2763
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:16,120
是的

2764
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:16,120
Yes.

2765
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:17,670
他是否需要些什麼？

2766
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:17,670
Does he have a few screws loose？

2767
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:18,080
你說呢

2768
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:18,080
you bet

2769
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,960
但是並不是說他可以傷害我們

2770
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,960
but that doesn't mean he's gonna do us any harm.

2771
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,380
你還能忍受多久 麥克

2772
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,380
How long are you gonna keep this up Mac?

2773
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:21,990
忍受什麼？

2774
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:21,990
Keep up what?

2775
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:24,030
整體 這一切都像是在懲罰

2776
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:24,030
The whole, everything is a fined act.

2777
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:25,560
雞捨中有只惡狼

2778
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:25,560
There's a wolf in the hen house.

2779
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:26,750
是我們放進去的

2780
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:26,750
We let him in.

2781
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:28,350
我根本不該聽你的

2782
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:28,350
I never should have listened.

2783
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:30,800
我們有這些事情的合約 迪克

2784
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:30,800
We have a contract for just this sort of thing, Dick.

2785
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,110
本應該相信我的直覺

2786
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,110
Should have trusted my gut.

2787
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:34,980
這是我的錯了？

2788
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:34,980
So it's my fault, huh?

2789
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:38,030
就像之前的影院

2790
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:38,030
Just like the movie theater.

2791
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:39,110
好吧 真抱歉

2792
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:39,110
Well I'm sorry.

2793
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:40,670
我曾希望完成你的夢想

2794
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:40,670
I wanted you to have your dream.

2795
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:02,420
$94.00元

2796
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:02,420
$94.00

2797
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:08,820
真不敢相信運營費用這麼貴

2798
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:08,820
It's unbelievable what these suckers cost to run.

2799
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,970
你知道我的爸爸曾經擁有一家冰激凌店嗎？

2800
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,970
You know my papa used to own an ice cream parlor?

2801
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:15,350
他從冷藏成本中解脫

2802
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:15,350
He went belly up from the refridgeration costs.

2803
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,090
真的？

2804
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,090
Really?

2805
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:34,010
今天有個電話

2806
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:34,010
A man called today.

2807
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,610
伊利諾伊州第一銀行

2808
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,610
Illinois First Federal.

2809
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,280
他說他要什麼了嗎？

2810
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,280
Did he say what he wanted?

2811
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,510
你為什麼不告訴我？

2812
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,510
Why don't you tell me.

2813
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:50,550
他要什麼？

2814
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:50,550
What did he want?

2815
01:10:52,930 --> 01:10:53,760
雷

2816
01:10:52,930 --> 01:10:53,760
Ray

2817
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:55,120
什麼？

2818
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:55,120
What?

2819
01:10:58,350 --> 01:10:59,930
你是否抵押了我們的房子？

2820
01:10:58,350 --> 01:10:59,930
Did you mortgage our home?

2821
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:04,230
我們可能會一無所有

2822
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:04,230
We could lose everything.

2823
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,890
我特別說過聯繫我要使用工作電話

2824
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,890
I specifically said the office is the best place to reach me.

2825
01:11:35,890 --> 01:11:38,070
我打過好多次了 雷

2826
01:11:35,890 --> 01:11:38,070
I tried you there Mr. Kroc, numerous times.

2827
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:40,510
你不能給我家打電話

2828
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:40,510
You have no right to call me at my home.

2829
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:43,580
這簡直在公然侵犯我的隱私

2830
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:43,580
That's a blatant invasion of my privacy.

2831
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:44,420
先生

2832
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:44,420
With all due respect sir

2833
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:46,270
你已經欠款3個月

2834
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:46,270
when you're 3 months behind on your payments

2835
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:48,430
你不能選擇我們聯繫你的方式

2836
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:48,430
you don't get to pick and choose where we contact you.

2837
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:57,800
雷

2838
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:57,800
Ray.

2839
01:12:57,980 --> 01:12:58,920
驚喜檢查

2840
01:12:57,980 --> 01:12:58,920
Surprise inspection.

2841
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:01,350
你來作甚？

2842
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:01,350
What are you doing here?

2843
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,240
只是來看看怎麼樣了

2844
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,240
I just came up to see how thing's are going.

2845
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:12,660
$12,400.00元

2846
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:12,660
$12,400.00

2847
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:14,340
第一個月做的不錯

2848
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:14,340
That's a pretty good haul for month #1.

2849
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:15,070
還能更好

2850
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:15,070
Could be bigger.

2851
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:17,840
我不想公事私事混在一起

2852
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:17,840
I hate to mix business with pleasure

2853
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:18,390
我也不

2854
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:18,390
I don't.

2855
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:21,360
但是我的費用

2856
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:21,360
but, my expenses.

2857
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:22,520
願聞其詳

2858
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:22,520
What about them?

2859
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:24,490
高出預期數值

2860
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:24,490
Well they're a bit higher than I anticipated.

2861
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:27,070
特別是步道區

2862
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:27,070
One thing in particular the walk- in.

2863
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:29,370
費用很高

2864
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:29,370
That bill is a real whopper.

2865
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:31,650
我不知道 但這是個問題

2866
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:31,650
I don't know, it's a problem

2867
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:32,250
冰激凌

2868
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:32,250
all that ice cream...

2869
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:35,430
我不想跨越界限

2870
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:35,430
I don't wanna over step my bounds here,

2871
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:36,990
但是我們找到方法了

2872
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:36,990
but I may have found a solution.

2873
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:38,570
其實是瓊找到的

2874
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:38,570
Well Joan did, actually.

2875
01:13:41,870 --> 01:13:42,620
你沒說過

2876
01:13:41,870 --> 01:13:42,620
You don't say.

2877
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:45,610
如果我告訴你有種解決方法

2878
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:45,610
What if I told you there was a way,

2879
01:13:45,710 --> 01:13:47,410
所有你的運營夥伴都能夠

2880
01:13:45,710 --> 01:13:47,410
all of your owner operators could save

2881
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:50,350
每年在電費單上節省數百美元

2882
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:50,350
literally hundreds of dollars a year in electrical costs

2883
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:54,050
同時 製作奶昔的時間減半

2884
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:54,050
and reduce the time that it takes to make a milkshake, by half.

2885
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:56,290
我要

2886
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:56,290
I'll bite.

2887
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:08,770
奶昔粉

2888
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:08,770
It's a powdered milkshake.

2889
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,390
只是冰激凌的一點花費

2890
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,390
Costs a fraction of ice cream

2891
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:14,190
但卻無需冷藏

2892
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:14,190
and there's no refridgeration necessary.

2893
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:15,790
內含奶粉

2894
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:15,790
It contains powdered milk.

2895
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:19,410
增稠劑和乳化劑能夠模擬冰激凌的質地

2896
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:19,410
Thickening agents and emulsifiers simulate the texture of ice cream.

2897
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:21,080
口感一致

2898
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:21,080
Tastes just like the real thing.

2899
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:22,380
製作簡單

2900
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:22,380
It's easy as pie to make.

2901
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:25,120
玻璃杯裏放一包 攪拌它

2902
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:25,120
You put a packet into a glass of water and stir it.

2903
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:26,670
我這些可能褻瀆了

2904
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:26,670
I know it may be a tad blasphemous

2905
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:28,160
你曾經的奶製品行業背景

2906
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:28,160
what with your dairy background and all

2907
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:28,710
個人認為

2908
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:28,710
Personally,

2909
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:31,220
這是個好主意

2910
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:31,220
I think it's a marvelous idea.

2911
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:37,390
巧克力還是香草味？

2912
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:37,390
Chocolate or vanilla?

2913
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:39,140
香草

2914
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:39,140
Vanilla.

2915
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:03,200
美好會降臨到 那些願意等待的人們身上

2916
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:03,200
Good things come to those who wait.

2917
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:28,580
怎麼樣？

2918
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:28,580
What do you think?

2919
01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:31,800
我想我正在喝一杯極品奶昔

2920
01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:31,800
I think I'm drinking a delicious vanilla milkshake.

2921
01:15:34,670 --> 01:15:35,260
可以嗎？

2922
01:15:34,670 --> 01:15:35,260
May I?

2923
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:45,340
我不能拒絕

2924
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:45,340
I can't resist.

2925
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:47,500
你怎麼看？

2926
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:47,500
So what do you say?

2927
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:50,400
在我們的地盤試一下 如果做的好

2928
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:50,400
We try it out at our place and if it goes well

2929
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:51,630
我們就推廣到全國

2930
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:51,630
We roll it out nationally.

2931
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:54,030
我能這樣

2932
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:54,030
I could, yeah.

2933
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:55,060
讓我想想

2934
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:55,060
Let me think about it.

2935
01:15:58,830 --> 01:15:59,550
聽你的

2936
01:15:58,830 --> 01:15:59,550
You're the boss.

2937
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:09,700
麥當勞

2938
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:09,700
McDonald's.

2939
01:16:09,850 --> 01:16:10,940
剛剛找到一種方法

2940
01:16:09,850 --> 01:16:10,940
Just found a way to save

2941
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:12,680
能夠節省你、我及所有店舖的運營費用

2942
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:12,680
you me and all our owner operators

2943
01:16:12,690 --> 01:16:15,380
每年電費賬單降低數百元

2944
01:16:12,690 --> 01:16:15,380
literally hundreds of dollars a year in electrical costs.

2945
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:16,800
那是什麼？

2946
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:16,800
And what would that be?

2947
01:16:16,830 --> 01:16:18,290
三個字：奶昔粉

2948
01:16:16,830 --> 01:16:18,290
Two words: powerded milkshake.

2949
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:22,120
我找到一種instamix牌的產品很棒

2950
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:22,120
I'm tellin' you I came across a remarkable called instamix.

2951
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,140
正如我說 這是奶昔粉

2952
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,140
Like I say, it's a powdered milkshake,

2953
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:26,430
比冰激淋便宜很多

2954
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:26,430
it's a fraction of the cost of ice cream

2955
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,330
又不需要冷藏室

2956
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,330
and requires no refridgeration.

2957
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:28,720
雷

2958
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:28,720
Ray

2959
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:30,090
告訴我我已經親自試過

2960
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:30,090
I tell You I tried it myself,

2961
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:31,110
毫無差異

2962
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:31,110
it tastes just like the real thing.

2963
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:32,060
非常美味

2964
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:32,060
It's delicious!

2965
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:33,750
可選巧克力 香草味

2966
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:33,750
Comes in chocolate, comes in vanilla

2967
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:34,950
我 我愛香草

2968
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:34,950
me, I'm a vanilla man.

2969
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,710
雷 我們不感興趣那種沒有牛奶的奶昔

2970
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,710
Ray we have no interest in a milkshake that contains NO MILK.

2971
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:41,060
就像我們不會給漢堡加入鋸末一個意思

2972
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:41,060
Why don't we add sawdust to the hamburgers while we're at it.

2973
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:42,370
或冰凍炸薯條

2974
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:42,370
frozen french fries.

2975
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:43,780
你不想保存那些

2976
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:43,780
You don't want to save a bundle.

2977
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:44,590
不像那樣

2978
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:44,590
Not like that.

2979
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,520
我是在說味道一樣美妙

2980
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,520
We're talking about the same great taste

2981
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:49,030
一樣的味道 卻加速了生產

2982
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:49,030
same great taste, while boosting the bottom line.

2983
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:51,130
那叫做奶昔 雷

2984
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:51,130
It's called a milkshake Ray.

2985
01:16:51,210 --> 01:16:52,210
要有奶

2986
01:16:51,210 --> 01:16:52,210
Real milk.

2987
01:16:52,290 --> 01:16:53,520
永遠這樣

2988
01:16:52,290 --> 01:16:53,520
Now and forever!

2989
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:54,760
我懂...

2990
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:54,760
I understa...

2991
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:19,710
我只是請求你允許延期

2992
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:19,710
I'm just asking you to extend my line.

2993
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:23,300
除非你在你家裏建立更多股權 或償還貸款

2994
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:23,300
Until you build more equity in your home or pay down the loan

2995
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:24,320
其他我都不能提供

2996
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:24,320
there's nothing I can do.

2997
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,360
我的企業在爆炸式成長

2998
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,360
My business is booming.

2999
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,810
對不起 這不重要

3000
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,810
Unfortunately that's immaterial.

3001
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:28,990
我在九個州擁有13家店舖

3002
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:28,990
Well, I've got 13 locations in 9 states...

3003
01:17:29,670 --> 01:17:30,780
這是家庭房屋貸款

3004
01:17:29,670 --> 01:17:30,780
It's a home equity loan.

3005
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:31,910
那就給我做商業貸款啊

3006
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:31,910
Then give me a business loan.

3007
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:33,490
你是否擁有這13處商業資產

3008
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:33,490
These 13 locations, do you own them?

3009
01:17:33,490 --> 01:17:34,270
我個人？

3010
01:17:33,490 --> 01:17:34,270
Me personally?

3011
01:17:34,270 --> 01:17:35,440
是你的企業 對嗎？

3012
01:17:34,270 --> 01:17:35,440
It's your business, correct?

3013
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,070
你有產權

3014
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,070
You own it.

3015
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:37,490
我只是特許經營的總部

3016
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:37,490
I'm the head of franchising.

3017
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:40,880
這些增長是我幹的

3018
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:40,880
I'm the one behind this growth.

3019
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,390
這都不錯 但是你需要資產作為抵押

3020
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,390
That's all well and good but you need assets.

3021
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:46,220
你去過麥當勞嗎？

3022
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:46,220
Have you been to a McDonald's?

3023
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:48,430
芝加哥區域我已經有3家分店

3024
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:48,430
Because we've got 3 right here in the Chicagoland area

3025
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:49,930
你應該過來看看

3026
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:49,930
and you should come by and take a look.

3027
01:17:49,930 --> 01:17:51,420
我很樂意帶你餐館

3028
01:17:49,930 --> 01:17:51,420
I would love to give you a tour

3029
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:53,270
並讓你深入瞭解我所說的一切

3030
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:53,270
to give you a better sense of what I'm talking about.

3031
01:17:56,540 --> 01:17:57,120
克羅克先生

3032
01:17:56,540 --> 01:17:57,120
Mr. Kroc...

3033
01:17:58,690 --> 01:17:59,580
我能為你做些什麼？

3034
01:17:58,690 --> 01:17:59,580
May I help you?

3035
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:03,310
不 也許我能為你做些事情

3036
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:03,310
No, but... perhaps I can help you.

3037
01:18:03,810 --> 01:18:05,200
哈利·索恩本  很高興認識你

3038
01:18:03,810 --> 01:18:05,200
Harry Sonneborn, nice to meet you.

3039
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:07,260
不了 謝謝

3040
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:07,260
No, thanks.

3041
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:08,990
我對現在的供應商非常滿意

3042
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:08,990
We're very happy with our current supplier.

3043
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:11,010
我不是在這裏給你賣冰激凌的

3044
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:11,010
I'm not here to sell you ice cream.

3045
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:12,590
那你要什麼？

3046
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:12,590
What the hell do you want?

3047
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,510
我在那裏聽到了你的一些對話

3048
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,510
I caught a bit of your conversation back there,

3049
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:16,300
聽起來你遇到了財務問題

3050
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:16,300
sounds like you're having financial troubles.

3051
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:17,720
為什麼不管你自己的事情？

3052
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:17,720
Why don't you mind your own business?

3053
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:19,440
我非常仰慕你的成就

3054
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:19,440
I'm a great admirer of your establishment.

3055
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:21,680
謝謝

3056
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:21,680
Thank you.

3057
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:24,240
我每周兩次去你的沃基根分店

3058
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:24,240
I eat lunch at your Waukegan location at least twice a week.

3059
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:25,780
總是有夢幻般的人群

3060
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:25,780
Always a fantastic crowd.

3061
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:26,910
你想說的是？

3062
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:26,910
Your point being...

3063
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:30,610
克羅克先生 如果你沒有能管好錢

3064
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:30,610
Mr. Kroc, if you're not making money hand over fist

3065
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:32,380
一定有大問題

3066
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:32,380
something's terribly wrong.

3067
01:18:36,970 --> 01:18:38,490
瓊 能拿一下賬本嗎？

3068
01:18:36,970 --> 01:18:38,490
June, grab the ledger would You?

3069
01:18:39,530 --> 01:18:40,470
哈利 來辦公室

3070
01:18:39,530 --> 01:18:40,470
Come on in the office Harry.

3071
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:54,280
現在 簡單來說

3072
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:54,280
So, to summerize,

3073
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:56,780
你有一些收入流

3074
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:56,780
you have a miniscule revenue stream.

3075
01:18:57,090 --> 01:18:57,950
沒有現金保留

3076
01:18:57,090 --> 01:18:57,950
no cash reserves

3077
01:18:58,610 --> 01:19:00,070
沉重負擔的合約

3078
01:18:58,610 --> 01:19:00,070
and an albatross of a contract

3079
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:02,300
這需要你花費很長時間在內部手續上

3080
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:02,300
that requires you to go through a slow approval process

3081
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:04,360
批准後才能頒布政令

3082
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:04,360
to enact changes if they're approved at all.

3083
01:19:04,970 --> 01:19:05,920
看來從未被批准過

3084
01:19:04,970 --> 01:19:05,920
Which, they never are.

3085
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:08,470
還有什麼嗎？

3086
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:08,470
Am I missing anything?

3087
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:09,830
總結的差不多了

3088
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:09,830
That about sums it up.

3089
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:12,640
說說那片地

3090
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:12,640
Tell me about the land.

3091
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,190
那片地

3092
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,190
The... land.

3093
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:17,570
土地 建築物 他們都是如何協同運作的

3094
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:17,570
The land, the buildings, how that whole aspect of it works.

3095
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,290
哦 其實很簡單

3096
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,290
Oh, pretty simple really

3097
01:19:19,530 --> 01:19:21,970
加盟經營者找到他喜歡的位置

3098
01:19:19,530 --> 01:19:21,970
franchisee finds a piece of land he likes

3099
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:23,810
簽約 通常是20年

3100
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:23,810
gets a lease, usually 20 years...

3101
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:25,350
使用我們的建設貸款

3102
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:25,350
and takes our construction loan...

3103
01:19:26,570 --> 01:19:28,410
建立店面 開始營業

3104
01:19:26,570 --> 01:19:28,410
throws up a building and off he goes.

3105
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,320
你是說加盟者決定地點

3106
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,320
So the operator selects the site?

3107
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:33,300
是的

3108
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:33,300
Yeah.

3109
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:34,660
他們決定選址?

3110
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:34,660
He picks the property.

3111
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:35,300
對的

3112
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:35,300
Right.

3113
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:38,610
你負責培訓 設備 運營方法

3114
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:38,610
You provide the training, the system,the operational know how

3115
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:41,570
他們負責其它

3116
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:41,570
and he is responsible for the rest.

3117
01:19:42,610 --> 01:19:43,390
這也是問題？

3118
01:19:42,610 --> 01:19:43,390
Is there a problem?

3119
01:19:43,390 --> 01:19:44,000
最大的問題

3120
01:19:43,390 --> 01:19:44,000
A big one.

3121
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:46,590
似乎你還沒意識到你在做些什麼

3122
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:46,590
You don't seem to realize what business you're in.

3123
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:50,060
你不是在漢堡行業打拼

3124
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:50,060
You're not in the burger business,

3125
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,920
你是在地產行業打拼

3126
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,920
you're in the real estate business.

3127
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:56,530
你並不是建立一個帝國

3128
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:56,530
You don't build an empire

3129
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:01,140
而只從一毛五的漢堡裏獲取 1.4%的利潤

3130
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:01,140
off a 1.4% cut of a $0.15 hamburger.

3131
01:20:02,150 --> 01:20:04,430
用地產去獲取利潤

3132
01:20:02,150 --> 01:20:04,430
You build it by owning the land

3133
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:06,700
就是你漢堡店的地產

3134
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:06,700
upon which that burger is cooked.

3135
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:09,350
你應該買的是

3136
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:09,350
What you ought to be doing

3137
01:20:09,730 --> 01:20:11,300
買大量的土地

3138
01:20:09,730 --> 01:20:11,300
is buying up plots of land

3139
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:15,040
之後轉手租賃給那些加盟經營者

3140
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:15,040
then turning around and leasing said plots to franchisees.

3141
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:16,840
他們受到條款限制

3142
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:16,840
Who as a condition of their deal

3143
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:19,090
會從你這裏租賃

3144
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:19,090
should be permitted to lease from you,

3145
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:20,450
而且只有你可以出租

3146
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:20,450
and you alone.

3147
01:20:21,470 --> 01:20:23,010
這會帶給你兩個好處

3148
01:20:21,470 --> 01:20:23,010
一、穩定的前期收入流

3149
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:25,820
一、穩定的前期收入流

3150
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:25,820
1. A steady up front revenue stream

3151
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:28,320
在還沒有造出第一個漢堡時你就有收入了

3152
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:28,320
money flows in before the first stake is in the ground.

3153
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:31,610
二、更大的資本擴張

3154
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:31,610
2. Greater capital for expansion.

3155
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,400
這反過來又進一步刺激土地收購

3156
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,400
Which in turn fuels further land aquisition

3157
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,550
反過來又進一步刺激擴張

3158
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,550
which in turn fuels further expansion...

3159
01:20:36,890 --> 01:20:38,740
如此往復  往復

3160
01:20:36,890 --> 01:20:38,740
and so on, and so on.

3161
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:43,810
土地

3162
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:43,810
Land.

3163
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:48,070
這才是價值的創造

3164
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:48,070
That's where the money is.

3165
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:49,240
還需要有

3166
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:49,240
And more than that

3167
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:50,340
控制

3168
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:50,340
control

3169
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:54,080
完全控制加盟經營商

3170
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:54,080
Control over the franchisee.

3171
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:56,400
不能質量達標的

3172
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:56,400
Fail to uphold quality standards

3173
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:58,110
你停止租賃

3174
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:58,110
you cancel their lease.

3175
01:20:59,910 --> 01:21:02,730
架空麥克和迪克而進行控制

3176
01:20:59,910 --> 01:21:02,730
Control over Dick and Mac.

3177
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:05,710
最終結果 你就控制了銀行和加盟經營商

3178
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:05,710
End result, you'll have the banks and the

3179
01:21:05,710 --> 01:21:07,970
玩弄在股掌之中

3180
01:21:05,710 --> 01:21:07,970
franchisees in the palm of your hand.

3181
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:12,640
如果我這樣做了 那兄弟倆 他們會

3182
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:12,640
If I were to do this, the brothers, they uh...

3183
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,650
將會很有效

3184
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,650
effectively would be

3185
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:18,660
是的

3186
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:18,660
Yes.

3187
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:24,210
所以...

3188
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:24,210
So...

3189
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,300
你怎麼看？雷

3190
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,300
What do you say Ray?

3191
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:44,370
我們需要支持

3192
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:44,370
We'll need backing.

3193
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:47,770
我已經安排了與投資者和金融機構的會議

3194
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:47,770
I've arranged meetings with investors and financial institutions.

3195
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:50,890
城鎮中心已經過飽和了

3196
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:50,890
The center of town which is the only oversaturated aspect

3197
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,940
這裏有人聽說或吃過麥當勞嗎？

3198
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,940
Has anyone here ever eaten at McDonald's?

3199
01:21:55,940 --> 01:21:58,050
人口的增長可以讓我們不斷擴張...

3200
01:21:55,940 --> 01:21:58,050
This population growth is going to enable us to expand...

3201
01:21:58,050 --> 01:21:59,940
斐然赤色地產公司

3202
01:21:58,050 --> 01:21:59,940
Franchise Realty Corrporation

3203
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:01,910
這些數字看似誇張

3204
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:01,910
The figures are exaggerated

3205
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:04,030
但是全部有數據證明

3206
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:04,030
but they're fully supported by the numericals.

3207
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:06,130
實際上 我們錯誤的與這些警告在一邊

3208
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:06,130
In fact, we erred on the side of caution with these.

3209
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:07,000
他很保守

3210
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:07,000
He's being conservative.

3211
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,670
我 基於我的直覺

3212
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,670
Mine, based on gut

3213
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:10,660
我的直覺告訴我這些數字很少

3214
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:10,660
and my gut tells me those numbers are low.

3215
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:12,650
麥當勞的成長太快了

3216
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:12,650
McDonald's, growing quick as a hick.

3217
01:22:12,650 --> 01:22:13,710
我是 哈利·索恩本 這位是 雷·克羅克

3218
01:22:12,650 --> 01:22:13,710
I'm Harry Sonneborn, this is Ray Kroc.

3219
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:15,050
趕緊去麥當勞

3220
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:15,050
Hurry over to McDonald's.

3221
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:18,660
現在已經為全國的家庭和社區提供服務

3222
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:18,660
Now serving family communities from coast to coast.

3223
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:23,490
你也許和這家美國最受歡迎的餐廳只有幾步之遙

3224
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:23,490
You're probably only minutes away from America's favorite restaurant.

3225
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:27,690
麥當勞快速服務 是開聚會的好地方

3226
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:27,690
McDonald's fast service is the perfect answer for parties,

3227
01:22:27,730 --> 01:22:30,570
隨時享用生日午餐 家庭聚餐

3228
01:22:27,730 --> 01:22:30,570
birthday lunches, and family meals any time.

3229
01:22:31,490 --> 01:22:33,980
不用操心 也不用洗碗

3230
01:22:31,490 --> 01:22:33,980
With no fuss or dishes to do.

3231
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:37,000
這是最偉大超值的美國食物

3232
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:37,000
It's America's greatest food value.

3233
01:22:37,310 --> 01:22:39,980
難怪你會經常在那裏看到你的鄰居

3234
01:22:37,310 --> 01:22:39,980
No wonder you see so many of your neighbors there.

3235
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:42,060
如果你想感受家庭食物

3236
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:42,060
If you want home quality cooking

3237
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:44,650
又不想在家做 請嘗試麥當勞

3238
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:44,650
without the home work, try McDonald's.

3239
01:22:44,650 --> 01:22:46,960
找到麥當勞的黃金拱門

3240
01:22:44,650 --> 01:22:46,960
Look for the Golden Arches at McDonald's.

3241
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:49,750
離家最近的店舖

3242
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:49,750
The closest thing to home.

3243
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:03,290
你是否聽說過斐然赤色地產公司

3244
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:03,290
Have you heard of the Franchise Realty Corporation?

3245
01:23:03,570 --> 01:23:03,960
那是什麼？

3246
01:23:03,570 --> 01:23:03,960
What is it?

3247
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:08,960
我不知道 但是看起來 雷·克羅克 是董事會主席和首席執行官

3248
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:08,960
I have no clue. Apparently Ray Kroc is president and C.E.O.

3249
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:13,950
Hi 迪克 近來可好？

3250
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:13,950
Hi Dick, how You doin'?

3251
01:23:14,050 --> 01:23:16,320
如果你真想知道 其實我有些惱火

3252
01:23:14,050 --> 01:23:16,320
-  Well if you really wanna know, I'm a tad miffed.

3253
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:17,820
為什麼？是什麼問題？

3254
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:17,820
Why, what seems to be the problem?

3255
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:19,850
斐然赤色地產公司

3256
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:19,850
Franchise Realty Corporation.

3257
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:20,500
怎麼了？

3258
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:20,500
What about it?

3259
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:24,020
首先 可否告訴我那是什麼？

3260
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:24,020
For starters, would you mind telling me what it is?

3261
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:25,270
事實上沒什麼

3262
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:25,270
Oh nothing really.

3263
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:28,650
只是我建立的一家出租服務公司

3264
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:28,650
Just a little something I created to provide leasing services

3265
01:23:28,650 --> 01:23:31,320
給那些新加入的加盟經營店提供貸款服務

3266
01:23:28,650 --> 01:23:31,320
you know, lend support to our new franchisees.

3267
01:23:31,470 --> 01:23:35,390
你知道 在我們沒弄清楚前 你不能做這些

3268
01:23:31,470 --> 01:23:35,390
You know full well you can't do something like that without first clearing it.

3269
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:40,550
為什麼我要那樣做？

3270
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:40,550
Now, why would I need to do that?

3271
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:42,370
因為你的合約上寫明了

3272
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:42,370
Because as your deal states

3273
01:23:42,370 --> 01:23:45,100
任何形式的改變必須書面形式並獲得許可

3274
01:23:42,370 --> 01:23:45,100
any and all changes must be agreed to in writing.

3275
01:23:45,530 --> 01:23:46,920
除非這不是改變

3276
01:23:45,530 --> 01:23:46,920
Except it's not a change.

3277
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:48,100
什麼意思？

3278
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:48,100
Excuse me?

3279
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:49,830
這不是改變

3280
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:49,830
It's not a change.

3281
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:51,130
這是一家公司

3282
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:51,130
It's a company.

3283
01:23:53,310 --> 01:23:54,860
獨立運營的另一家公司

3284
01:23:53,310 --> 01:23:54,860
It's its own separate company,

3285
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:56,800
並不在你的管理範圍之下

3286
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:56,800
which puts it outside your purview.

3287
01:23:57,340 --> 01:24:00,570
跟麥當勞品牌相關的任何事情都在我們的管理權限內

3288
01:23:57,340 --> 01:24:00,570
Anything relating to McDonald's is within our purview.

3289
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:04,080
迪克讓我給你解釋一下

3290
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:04,080
Let me explain something to you Dick

3291
01:24:05,390 --> 01:24:09,770
你們明確的聲明在餐館之內的任何事情都有權

3292
01:24:05,390 --> 01:24:09,770
You boys have full say over what goes on inside the restaurants.

3293
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:12,880
但是餐館的外面，上面、下面

3294
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:12,880
But outside, above, below...

3295
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,750
你的權限界限就是門

3296
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,750
your authority stops at the door.

3297
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:18,310
和門內的地板

3298
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:18,310
And at the floor.

3299
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:20,950
對吧？

3300
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:20,950
Alright?

3301
01:24:30,410 --> 01:24:31,220
他說什麼？

3302
01:24:30,410 --> 01:24:31,220
What is he saying?

3303
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,220
他買了土地

3304
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,220
He's buying the land.

3305
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:35,480
我們店的土地？

3306
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:35,480
Our land?

3307
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:38,600
手指向地圖

3308
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:38,600
Get one of the map.

3309
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:41,690
做這些 我想拍下地圖上所有的大頭針

3310
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:41,690
Make sure to get this and we wanna get all the pins in there.

3311
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:45,910
你確認能看清這個？

3312
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:45,910
You sure you see this?

3313
01:24:48,430 --> 01:24:50,200
桌子那拍張怎麼樣？

3314
01:24:48,430 --> 01:24:50,200
How about one at the desk?

3315
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:02,040
請確認照片中出現這個

3316
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:02,040
Make sure you get that in focus.

3317
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:02,980
好的 微笑

3318
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:02,980
OK Smile.

3319
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:04,530
不錯 不錯 不錯 不錯

3320
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:04,530
Good, good, good, good.

3321
01:25:09,550 --> 01:25:10,240
快遞

3322
01:25:09,550 --> 01:25:10,240
Delivery!

3323
01:25:13,130 --> 01:25:13,970
你想放在哪裏？

3324
01:25:13,130 --> 01:25:13,970
Where do you want these?

3325
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:15,850
雷

3326
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:15,850
Ray

3327
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:18,900
我想了一遍

3328
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:18,900
I thought it over

3329
01:25:20,630 --> 01:25:21,240
同意了

3330
01:25:20,630 --> 01:25:21,240
Approved.

3331
01:25:24,090 --> 01:25:24,750
真的

3332
01:25:24,090 --> 01:25:24,750
Really?

3333
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:26,260
謝謝你

3334
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:26,260
Thank you.

3335
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:27,290
不 我要謝謝你

3336
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:27,290
No, thank you.

3337
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:29,000
魔法般的主意

3338
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:29,000
It's a wizz bang idea and

3339
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,060
是你想到這個主意的

3340
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,060
you're the one who thought of it.

3341
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:33,420
我們非常榮幸能成為你的測試廠

3342
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:33,420
Well we're deeply honored to serve as your test market.

3343
01:25:33,710 --> 01:25:34,650
瞎說什麼

3344
01:25:33,710 --> 01:25:34,650
The hell with that.

3345
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:36,580
我將把這個推廣到全國

3346
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:36,580
I'm gonna roll this out nationally.

3347
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:40,200
你是否看了最新的RBM雜誌

3348
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:40,200
You seen the latest copy of RBM?

3349
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:41,790
封面人物

3350
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:41,790
Hot off the press.

3351
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:46,160
雷 這對你很好

3352
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:46,160
Ray, good for you.

3353
01:25:56,190 --> 01:25:58,110
南部 大約距市中心10英里遠

3354
01:25:56,190 --> 01:25:58,110
It's about 10 miles south of downtown

3355
01:25:58,110 --> 01:26:00,210
他們正在建造一個全新的體育場

3356
01:25:58,110 --> 01:26:00,210
They're building a brand new sports stadium there.

3357
01:26:00,210 --> 01:26:01,280
是的 我聽說了

3358
01:26:00,210 --> 01:26:01,280
Yeah, I read about it.

3359
01:26:01,290 --> 01:26:03,430
有職業棒球和橄欖球隊

3360
01:26:01,290 --> 01:26:03,430
We're getting a profesional baseball and football team

3361
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:04,680
會將那裏作為主場

3362
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:04,680
they'll both be playing there.

3363
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:07,110
我想我知道你指的是哪裏

3364
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:07,110
I think I know where you're headed with this.

3365
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:10,560
擁有四萬個座位的體育場只有石頭嗎？

3366
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:10,560
A 40,000 seat stadium just a stone's throw away?

3367
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:11,820
想像那里的客流量

3368
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:11,820
Imagine the foot traffic.

3369
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:14,420
在比賽後飢餓的家庭想找東西吃

3370
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:14,420
Hungry families looking for a bite to eat after the game.

3371
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:16,250
或者比賽前？無所謂了

3372
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:16,250
Or before? Whenever.

3373
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:17,140
就是這樣

3374
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:17,140
Exactly.

3375
01:26:18,050 --> 01:26:19,360
是啊

3376
01:26:18,050 --> 01:26:19,360
Yeah.

3377
01:26:21,070 --> 01:26:22,410
瓊 你想的真遠大

3378
01:26:21,070 --> 01:26:22,410
You think big, don't you Joan?

3379
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:27,270
還有其它方法嗎？

3380
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:27,270
Is there any other way to?

3381
01:26:31,530 --> 01:26:33,000
你將會感到驚喜

3382
01:26:31,530 --> 01:26:33,000
Well, you'd be surprised.

3383
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:37,610
很多人害怕抓住機會

3384
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:37,610
A lot of people are afraid of taking a chance

3385
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:40,300
變得 變得偉大

3386
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:40,300
to you know, reach for greatness.

3387
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:43,740
那太悲傷了

3388
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:43,740
That's so sad.

3389
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:45,740
我同意

3390
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:45,740
I agree.

3391
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:47,330
雄心

3392
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:47,330
Ambition.

3393
01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:49,760
充斥著生活日常

3394
01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:49,760
That's the stuff in life.

3395
01:26:51,370 --> 01:26:52,820
那句話怎麼說的來著？

3396
01:26:51,370 --> 01:26:52,820
What was that saying?

3397
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:56,900
命運偏愛勇敢之人

3398
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:56,900
Fortune favors the bold.

3399
01:26:57,250 --> 01:26:58,200
絕對如此

3400
01:26:57,250 --> 01:26:58,200
Absolutely.

3401
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:04,930
就像你一樣

3402
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:04,930
Just look at you.

3403
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:11,650
你說我膽大 瓊？

3404
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:11,650
You calling me bold, Joan?

3405
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:14,390
若膽小如鼠

3406
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:14,390
You don't build a restaurant empire

3407
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:16,170
可建不起餐館帝國

3408
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:16,170
acting like a timid little mouse.

3409
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:43,730
這是個快速增長的領域

3410
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:43,730
That's a fast growing area.

3411
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:46,660
便宜 你正在說的是每英畝便宜15%

3412
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:46,660
And cheaper. You're talking a good 15% less per acre.

3413
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:49,000
我還是認為休斯頓是更好的地方

3414
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:49,000
I still think Houston's a better location.

3415
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:49,430
雷

3416
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:49,430
Ray?

3417
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:49,990
在

3418
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:49,990
Yeah.

3419
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:51,100
迪克在電話一號線

3420
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:51,100
Dick's on line 1.

3421
01:27:52,450 --> 01:27:52,850
好的

3422
01:27:52,450 --> 01:27:52,850
Well.

3423
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:01,910
嘿 迪克

3424
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:01,910
Hi Dick.

3425
01:28:01,970 --> 01:28:04,480
我剛接到一個令人非常不安的電話

3426
01:28:01,970 --> 01:28:04,480
I just received a very disconcerting call.

3427
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:05,250
哦？

3428
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:05,250
Oh?

3429
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:07,670
巴迪·傑普森打過來的

3430
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:07,670
From Buddy Jepson, our

3431
01:28:08,090 --> 01:28:09,780
三塊饅頭地區店的執行官

3432
01:28:08,090 --> 01:28:09,780
operator in Sacramento.

3433
01:28:10,090 --> 01:28:11,970
我清楚誰是巴迪·傑普森

3434
01:28:10,090 --> 01:28:11,970
I'm very aware of who Buddy Jepson is.

3435
01:28:11,970 --> 01:28:14,290
他告訴我 今早他收到供貨

3436
01:28:11,970 --> 01:28:14,290
He told me he received a shipment this morning.

3437
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:15,160
哦 送到了

3438
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:15,160
Oh, it arrived.

3439
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:17,150
你超出底線了 雷

3440
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:17,150
You are way out of line, Ray.

3441
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:20,590
嘿 週五早上之前我都沒想過會送到

3442
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:20,590
Hey I didn't expect that to get there until Friday at the earliest.

3443
01:28:20,590 --> 01:28:21,680
是否介意告訴我 你在做些什麼

3444
01:28:20,590 --> 01:28:21,680
Would you mind telling me what you are doing

3445
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:26,160
發送四箱Instamix奶昔粉給我們的分店？

3446
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:26,160
shipping 4 cases of Instamix to one of our operators?

3447
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:29,570
看 如果你不想賺錢

3448
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:29,570
Look, if you don't wanna

3449
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:31,360
那麼無所謂

3450
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:31,360
make a profit, that's fine.

3451
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,810
但是不要阻止我們賺錢

3452
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,810
But don't stop the rest of us.

3453
01:28:33,050 --> 01:28:33,680
我們？

3454
01:28:33,050 --> 01:28:33,680
Us?

3455
01:28:34,230 --> 01:28:36,680
我們 是指除了你之外的所有人

3456
01:28:34,230 --> 01:28:36,680
Us, as in everyone but you.

3457
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:37,940
你把貨都發給誰了？

3458
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:37,940
Who did you send them to?

3459
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:39,140
除了你的所有人

3460
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:39,140
Everyone but you.

3461
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:41,510
你沒有這個權利

3462
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:41,510
You have no right.

3463
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:44,240
你必須停止這個 你明白了嗎？

3464
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:44,240
You are to stop this instant, is that clear?

3465
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:46,650
也許不

3466
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:46,650
Nah.

3467
01:28:47,470 --> 01:28:48,900
「也許不」是什麼意思？

3468
01:28:47,470 --> 01:28:48,900
What the hell does that mean, nah?

3469
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:51,150
你必須遵守你的交易條款

3470
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:51,150
You will abide by the terms of your deal.

3471
01:28:53,860 --> 01:28:56,760
我完全聽從你的軍令

3472
01:28:53,860 --> 01:28:56,760
I am through taking marching orders from you

3473
01:28:56,910 --> 01:28:59,250
你和你那無盡的「不同意」

3474
01:28:56,910 --> 01:28:59,250
you and your endless parade of NO's.

3475
01:28:59,290 --> 01:29:02,190
面對進步 不斷地退縮

3476
01:28:59,290 --> 01:29:02,190
Constantly cowering in the face of progress.

3477
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:05,470
如果假奶的奶昔粉是你所說的進步

3478
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:05,470
If phony powdered milkshakes is your idea of progress

3479
01:29:05,690 --> 01:29:08,980
你完全曲解了什麼是「麥當勞」

3480
01:29:05,690 --> 01:29:08,980
you have a profound misunderstand of what McDonald's is about.

3481
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:12,930
我比你們兩個土老帽更瞭解什麼是「麥當勞」

3482
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:12,930
I have a far greater understanding of McDonald's than you two yokles.

3483
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:13,400
什麼？

3484
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:13,400
What?

3485
01:29:13,830 --> 01:29:15,900
你要按照我們說的去做

3486
01:29:13,830 --> 01:29:15,900
You will do as we say.

3487
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,290
也許不

3488
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,290
Nope.

3489
01:29:18,890 --> 01:29:20,310
我們有合同

3490
01:29:18,890 --> 01:29:20,310
You have a contract!

3491
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:30,030
你知道 合同就像是心臟

3492
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:30,030
You know, contracts are like hearts

3493
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:33,010
就是為了心碎那天而存在

3494
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:33,010
they're made to be broken.

3495
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:48,900
請給我遞一下鹽

3496
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:48,900
Could you please pass the salt?

3497
01:29:52,190 --> 01:29:52,980
謝謝

3498
01:29:52,190 --> 01:29:52,980
Thank you.

3499
01:30:06,940 --> 01:30:08,660
我想離婚

3500
01:30:06,940 --> 01:30:08,660
I want a divorce.

3501
01:30:34,910 --> 01:30:36,830
若想要低調的離婚

3502
01:30:34,910 --> 01:30:36,830
When trying to quietly settle a divorce

3503
01:30:37,210 --> 01:30:39,710
首先必須要明白她想要什麼？

3504
01:30:37,210 --> 01:30:39,710
the first thing to ask is, what will she want?

3505
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:42,320
並且 她的要求是否合理和公平？

3506
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:42,320
And, is her request reasonable and equitable?

3507
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,790
在婚姻財產方面 有房子

3508
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,790
In terms of marital property there's the house,

3509
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:47,100
汽車、儲蓄和支票

3510
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:47,100
and car, savings and checking accounts

3511
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:47,780
保險

3512
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:47,780
Insurance

3513
01:30:47,780 --> 01:30:48,580
都給她

3514
01:30:47,780 --> 01:30:48,580
Just give it to her.

3515
01:30:48,580 --> 01:30:49,610
房子、車、保險

3516
01:30:48,580 --> 01:30:49,610
House, car, insurance.

3517
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:53,900
那你的公司呢？

3518
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:53,900
What about the business?

3519
01:30:57,880 --> 01:30:58,470
也許不

3520
01:30:57,880 --> 01:30:58,470
Nope.

3521
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:01,800
雷 你必須明白

3522
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:01,800
Ray, You have to understand

3523
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:03,090
她也是...

3524
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:03,090
that she's the...

3525
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:03,430
K先生

3526
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:03,430
K.

3527
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:07,410
讓我來給你解釋一些

3528
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:07,410
Let me explain something to you.

3529
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:11,390
這絕不會發生

3530
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:11,390
It's never gonna happen.

3531
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:16,840
相比於給她一份麥當勞的股份

3532
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:16,840
I'd sooner die than give her

3533
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:19,660
我寧可立即死掉

3534
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:19,660
one single share of stock in McDonald's.

3535
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:28,280
這並不簡單 那兩個兄弟是你的合作夥伴

3536
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:28,280
It's not so simple. The brothers are your business partners.

3537
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,690
你也簽了合同

3538
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,690
You signed this contract.

3539
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:31,450
幹掉合同

3540
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:31,450
Make it go away.

3541
01:31:32,130 --> 01:31:33,560
我不關心要花多少

3542
01:31:32,130 --> 01:31:33,560
And I don't care what it takes.

3543
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:37,390
會花費不少的

3544
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:37,390
It's gonna cost You.

3545
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:06,420
「新口味 草莓味」

3546
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:06,420
'New Flavor, Strawberry'

3547
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:07,830
「你也許會喜歡這個 敬禮 雷」

3548
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:07,830
'Maybe you'll like this one, best, Ray'

3549
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:16,340
我看到你的信箋頭有麥當勞的字樣

3550
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:16,340
I'm looking at a letterhead with the name McDonald's on it.

3551
01:32:16,410 --> 01:32:17,660
能解釋一下嗎？

3552
01:32:16,410 --> 01:32:17,660
You care to explain?

3553
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:18,590
曾經很易混淆

3554
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:18,590
It was confusing.

3555
01:32:18,590 --> 01:32:21,080
人們根本不知道用麥當勞能做什麼

3556
01:32:18,590 --> 01:32:21,080
People didn't even know it had anything to do with McDonald's.

3557
01:32:21,190 --> 01:32:23,820
令人混亂的是你自己給自己起名

3558
01:32:21,190 --> 01:32:23,820
What's confusing is you calling yourself

3559
01:32:23,860 --> 01:32:25,480
「麥當勞公司」

3560
01:32:23,860 --> 01:32:25,480
'The McDonald's Corporation'.

3561
01:32:25,650 --> 01:32:27,320
人們會認為這就是整個公司

3562
01:32:25,650 --> 01:32:27,320
People will think it's the whole company,

3563
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:28,780
而不是你那個地產商

3564
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:28,780
not just the real estate arm...

3565
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:31,160
我們強烈懷疑這是你的希望

3566
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:31,160
which we strongly suspect is what you hope!

3567
01:32:31,930 --> 01:32:34,440
在你的信箋頭印上了迪克的黃金拱門？

3568
01:32:31,930 --> 01:32:34,440
You put Dick's arches on your letterhead?

3569
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:36,400
這不是你的公司 雷

3570
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:36,400
This is not your company, Ray.

3571
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:39,150
你明白嗎？

3572
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:39,150
Do you understand that!?!?

3573
01:32:39,170 --> 01:32:40,480
麥克 別心煩

3574
01:32:39,170 --> 01:32:40,480
Mac, don't get upset.

3575
01:32:41,070 --> 01:32:44,010
是我們開發的高速系統 不是你

3576
01:32:41,070 --> 01:32:44,010
We came up with the speedy system, not you.

3577
01:32:44,150 --> 01:32:44,660
是我們

3578
01:32:44,150 --> 01:32:44,660
Us.

3579
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:45,690
你貢獻了什麼？

3580
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:45,690
What have you ever come up with?

3581
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:46,780
能隨便列舉一二嗎？

3582
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:46,780
Can you name one thing?

3583
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:48,300
你不能 你從來沒做過任何貢獻

3584
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:48,300
You can't, and you never have

3585
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:48,990
你也不會再有機會

3586
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:48,990
and you never will...

3587
01:32:48,990 --> 01:32:50,230
雷 你就是吸血鬼

3588
01:32:48,990 --> 01:32:50,230
because you are a leech, Ray.

3589
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:51,780
你是職業吸血鬼

3590
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:51,780
You are a professional leech.

3591
01:32:51,890 --> 01:32:53,370
麥克 你知道我貢獻了什麼嗎？

3592
01:32:51,890 --> 01:32:53,370
You know what I came up with, Mac?

3593
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:54,570
一個概念

3594
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:54,570
A concept.

3595
01:32:54,710 --> 01:32:56,850
我貢獻了獲勝的概念

3596
01:32:54,710 --> 01:32:56,850
I came with the concept of winning.

3597
01:32:57,080 --> 01:32:57,480
讓我和他講

3598
01:32:57,080 --> 01:32:57,480
Let me talk to him.

3599
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:58,900
當你們哥倆選擇退縮

3600
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:58,900
While you two boys were content to sit back

3601
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:00,510
成為一對失敗者

3602
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:00,510
and become a couple of alsorans

3603
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:01,970
我要掌控未來

3604
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:01,970
I wanna take the future.

3605
01:33:02,170 --> 01:33:02,970
我要取勝

3606
01:33:02,170 --> 01:33:02,970
I wanna win.

3607
01:33:03,170 --> 01:33:04,280
而作為滿嘴胡說的傢伙

3608
01:33:03,170 --> 01:33:04,280
And you don't get there by being

3609
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:06,150
你們不會獲得成功

3610
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:06,150
some "aw shucks" guy sap.

3611
01:33:06,150 --> 01:33:08,180
商場沒有這樣人的空間

3612
01:33:06,150 --> 01:33:08,180
There's no place in business for people like that.

3613
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:09,560
商場如戰場

3614
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:09,560
Business is war.

3615
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:12,260
狗咬狗 人吃人

3616
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:12,260
It's dog eat dog, rat eat rat.

3617
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:14,210
如果我的競爭對手掉進水裏

3618
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:14,210
If my competitor were drowning

3619
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:17,350
我會走過去 再在他的嘴裏加根水管

3620
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:17,350
I'd walk over and put a hose right in his mouth.

3621
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:22,490
你們能做到嗎？

3622
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:22,490
Can you say the same?

3623
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:34,330
我不能

3624
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:34,330
I can't.

3625
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:36,410
也不是我想要的

3626
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:36,410
Nor would I want to.

3627
01:33:37,790 --> 01:33:39,120
這就是你為什麼只有一家店

3628
01:33:37,790 --> 01:33:39,120
Hence, your single location.

3629
01:33:40,810 --> 01:33:42,160
雷 我們要你離開這家公司

3630
01:33:40,810 --> 01:33:42,160
We want you out of this company, Ray.

3631
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:44,120
麥克 我們就這樣做 你能拿我怎麼樣？

3632
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:44,120
Mac, how do you propose we do that?

3633
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:44,960
我要告你

3634
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:44,960
We will sue you

3635
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:45,870
無論如何

3636
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:45,870
whatever it takes.

3637
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:47,200
也許你會贏

3638
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:47,200
And you'd probably win.

3639
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:48,560
但是你無法承擔訴訟我的費用

3640
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:48,560
But you can't afford to sue me.

3641
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:51,050
我會把你埋在法庭的費用裏

3642
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:51,050
I'd bury you in court costs alone.

3643
01:33:51,230 --> 01:33:53,060
麥克 我是大公司的董事會主席和首席執行官

3644
01:33:51,230 --> 01:33:53,060
Mac, I'm the president and C.E.O. of a

3645
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:56,910
而且擁有17個州的業務和地產

3646
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:56,910
major corporation with land holdings in 17 states...

3647
01:33:56,910 --> 01:33:58,810
你只有沙漠中的一個小漢堡店

3648
01:33:56,910 --> 01:33:58,810
You run a burger stand in the desert.

3649
01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:01,240
我是全國級

3650
01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:01,240
I'm national.

3651
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:04,000
你只是個破本地

3652
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:04,000
You're fucking local.

3653
01:34:13,070 --> 01:34:13,770
這簡直...

3654
01:34:13,070 --> 01:34:13,770
This

3655
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:15,280
麥克！

3656
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:15,280
Mac!

3657
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:22,870
你是否按計劃吃藥了？

3658
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:22,870
Are you following your eating plan?

3659
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:23,680
是的

3660
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:23,680
Yes.

3661
01:34:24,330 --> 01:34:25,540
你在測你的糖含量

3662
01:34:24,330 --> 01:34:25,540
And you're checking your glucose levels

3663
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:27,980
並且你正在按量持續服用你的藥物

3664
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:27,980
and you're taking your medication on a consistant basis

3665
01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:28,600
是的

3666
01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:28,600
Yes.

3667
01:34:29,310 --> 01:34:31,030
例行走動 每天20分鐘？

3668
01:34:29,310 --> 01:34:31,030
Regular walks, 20 minutes a day?

3669
01:34:31,030 --> 01:34:32,150
我全天都在走動

3670
01:34:31,030 --> 01:34:32,150
I'm on my feet all day.

3671
01:34:32,330 --> 01:34:32,940
有壓力嗎？

3672
01:34:32,330 --> 01:34:32,940
Any stress?

3673
01:34:38,530 --> 01:34:39,020
還好吧

3674
01:34:38,530 --> 01:34:39,020
Okay.

3675
01:34:39,650 --> 01:34:40,540
你需要關注這些

3676
01:34:39,650 --> 01:34:40,540
You need to watch that.

3677
01:34:40,540 --> 01:34:42,140
這是一個很重要的要素

3678
01:34:40,540 --> 01:34:42,140
That's a big contributing factor.

3679
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:44,490
正如我說的

3680
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:44,490
So as I said, your kidney

3681
01:34:44,490 --> 01:34:46,770
目前你的腎臟功能只有50%

3682
01:34:44,490 --> 01:34:46,770
function is currently at 50%.

3683
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:49,180
而18個月前有65%

3684
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:49,180
Now 18 months ago it was 65%.

3685
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:51,200
若再低你就會有

3686
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:51,200
Any lower and you're at serious

3687
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:53,050
嚴重的腎衰竭風險

3688
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:53,050
risk for kidney failure.

3689
01:34:54,870 --> 01:34:56,040
好的 我會再做檢查的

3690
01:34:54,870 --> 01:34:56,040
Okay, I'll check on you later.

3691
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:00,000
謝謝

3692
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:00,000
Thanks.

3693
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:00,610
謝謝你

3694
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:00,610
Thank you.

3695
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:12,560
威廉姆和裏維爾騎著...

3696
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:12,560
William who rode with Revere...

3697
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:14,340
一共幾個字母？

3698
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:14,340
How many letters?

3699
01:35:14,650 --> 01:35:16,300
五個 第四個是E

3700
01:35:14,650 --> 01:35:16,300
5, 4th letter 'E'.

3701
01:35:18,060 --> 01:35:18,950
是Dawes這個字

3702
01:35:18,060 --> 01:35:18,950
Dawes.

3703
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:22,400
請進

3704
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:22,400
Come in!

3705
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:26,810
小伙子們還好吧？

3706
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:26,810
How are you fellas?

3707
01:35:30,050 --> 01:35:31,190
聽起來你們在做拼字遊戲

3708
01:35:30,050 --> 01:35:31,190
Geez, sounded like something spilled

3709
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:32,200
聽著聲音我找到你們

3710
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:32,200
I followed it and I could found.

3711
01:35:33,710 --> 01:35:34,490
我聽說了那場 事故

3712
01:35:33,710 --> 01:35:34,490
I hear about the, accident.

3713
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:39,680
我把它放在這裏

3714
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:39,680
I'll set it right here.

3715
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:44,020
迪克

3716
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:44,020
Dick.

3717
01:35:45,210 --> 01:35:46,110
裏面有張卡

3718
01:35:45,210 --> 01:35:46,110
There's a card in there.

3719
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:50,650
繼續

3720
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:50,650
Go ahead.

3721
01:35:51,490 --> 01:35:52,060
是有個卡

3722
01:35:51,490 --> 01:35:52,060
That's okay.

3723
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:53,590
不 拿著 打開

3724
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:53,590
No, here. Just...

3725
01:35:54,590 --> 01:35:55,350
你會感到高興

3726
01:35:54,590 --> 01:35:55,350
You're gonna be happy.

3727
01:36:07,180 --> 01:36:07,780
這是什麼？

3728
01:36:07,180 --> 01:36:07,780
What's this?

3729
01:36:09,510 --> 01:36:10,080
你看它是什麼？

3730
01:36:09,510 --> 01:36:10,080
What's it look like?

3731
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:11,680
一張空白支票

3732
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:11,680
A blank check.

3733
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:16,250
對 那是... 嗯

3734
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:16,250
Then that's uh...

3735
01:36:17,370 --> 01:36:19,280
也許那就是支票

3736
01:36:17,370 --> 01:36:19,280
that's probably what it is.

3737
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:20,930
你要買什麼？

3738
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:20,930
What are you buying?

3739
01:36:29,210 --> 01:36:29,650
好了

3740
01:36:29,210 --> 01:36:29,650
Okay.

3741
01:36:31,330 --> 01:36:31,950
一旦你康復

3742
01:36:31,330 --> 01:36:31,950
You get better...

3743
01:36:32,730 --> 01:36:34,210
可以自己走動時

3744
01:36:32,730 --> 01:36:34,210
You get up on your feet in no time

3745
01:36:34,210 --> 01:36:38,170
我們再談 好吧？

3746
01:36:34,210 --> 01:36:38,170
and we'll talk. Alright?

3747
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:39,710
迪克

3748
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:39,710
Dick.

3749
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:12,800
我們永遠打不過

3750
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:12,800
We will never beat him.

3751
01:37:15,660 --> 01:37:17,200
也永遠甩不掉他

3752
01:37:15,660 --> 01:37:17,200
We will never be rid of him.

3753
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:30,200
迪克·麥當勞來電

3754
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:30,200
Dick McDonald's on the line.

3755
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:42,150
你好 迪克

3756
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:42,150
Hello Dick.

3757
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:44,530
270萬

3758
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:44,530
2.7 million.

3759
01:37:45,140 --> 01:37:47,450
那是稅後我們各自能得到1百萬的價格

3760
01:37:45,140 --> 01:37:47,450
That's a million for each of us after taxes.

3761
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:53,190
以及1%的公司利潤

3762
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:53,190
And, 1% of the company's

3763
01:37:53,190 --> 01:37:55,370
永久有效

3764
01:37:53,190 --> 01:37:55,370
profits in perpetuity.

3765
01:37:56,530 --> 01:37:57,340
這太不像話了

3766
01:37:56,530 --> 01:37:57,340
That's outrageous.

3767
01:37:57,410 --> 01:37:58,430
這簡直是勒索

3768
01:37:57,410 --> 01:37:58,430
That's borderline extortion.

3769
01:37:58,670 --> 01:38:00,020
這是一堆胡話

3770
01:37:58,670 --> 01:38:00,020
That's a bunch of bullshit.

3771
01:38:00,020 --> 01:38:00,420
胡話

3772
01:38:00,020 --> 01:38:00,420
BULLSHIT!

3773
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:01,510
我知道現在看起來很多錢

3774
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:01,510
I know it seems like a lot of money now.

3775
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:03,250
是呀 任何時候這都是很多錢

3776
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:03,250
Yeah, it seems like a lot of money any time.

3777
01:38:03,260 --> 01:38:04,830
他們還有其它要求

3778
01:38:03,260 --> 01:38:04,830
And they want one other thing.

3779
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:05,620
什麼？

3780
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:05,620
What?

3781
01:38:06,270 --> 01:38:06,900
聖貝納迪諾店

3782
01:38:06,270 --> 01:38:06,900
San Bernardino.

3783
01:38:06,950 --> 01:38:08,150
哈 沒門

3784
01:38:06,950 --> 01:38:08,150
Nah ah, No way.

3785
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,830
作為禮物 可以讓他們成為長期僱員

3786
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,830
To give to their long- time employees as a gift.

3787
01:38:11,070 --> 01:38:13,110
我要聖貝納迪諾的利潤

3788
01:38:11,070 --> 01:38:13,110
I need the profits from San Bernardino

3789
01:38:13,130 --> 01:38:14,670
用來償還購買貸款

3790
01:38:13,130 --> 01:38:14,670
in order to pay off the purchase loan.

3791
01:38:15,310 --> 01:38:17,090
我已經和他們的律師談了很長時間了

3792
01:38:15,310 --> 01:38:17,090
I've spoken about it at length with their lawyers

3793
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:19,200
很不幸 這點不可談判

3794
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:19,200
it's unfortunately, non- negotiable.

3795
01:38:21,470 --> 01:38:23,750
我的客戶完全同意你銷售的條件

3796
01:38:21,470 --> 01:38:23,750
Our client agrees fully with your conditions of sale

3797
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:24,960
但是有個特例

3798
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:24,960
with one exception

3799
01:38:25,550 --> 01:38:27,510
你未來企業盈利的1%分成

3800
01:38:25,550 --> 01:38:27,510
Your 1% cut of future corporate earnings

3801
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:29,910
必須雙方握手和解才能實施

3802
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:29,910
will have to be carried out on a handshake basis.

3803
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:33,810
這是我的投資

3804
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:33,810
It's my investor group.

3805
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:36,230
融資取決於...

3806
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:36,230
The financing is contigent on...

3807
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:38,250
把這些放到合同之外

3808
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:38,250
leaving that out of the contract

3809
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:40,130
不幸的是 這筆交易不會發生

3810
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:40,130
and unfortunately this deal just doesn't happen

3811
01:38:40,130 --> 01:38:42,380
除非你停止合約 否則不會得到資金

3812
01:38:40,130 --> 01:38:42,380
it doesn't get financed unless you leave it out of the contract.

3813
01:38:42,470 --> 01:38:43,940
因為不幸的是

3814
01:38:42,470 --> 01:38:43,940
because unfortunately that's

3815
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:45,660
這是他們的交易破碎者

3816
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:45,660
a deal breaker for them.

3817
01:38:51,330 --> 01:38:51,950
看 夥計們

3818
01:38:51,330 --> 01:38:51,950
Look fellas

3819
01:38:52,990 --> 01:38:55,100
你會得到所有版權費 對吧？

3820
01:38:52,990 --> 01:38:55,100
you'll get your full royalties, alright?

3821
01:38:59,790 --> 01:39:00,670
你有我的承諾

3822
01:38:59,790 --> 01:39:00,670
You got my word on that.

3823
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:02,320
迪克 麥克

3824
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:02,320
Dick, Mac...

3825
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:06,370
讓我們做個交易

3826
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:06,370
Let's make a deal.

3827
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:16,070
好

3828
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:16,070
Alright.

3829
01:39:17,390 --> 01:39:18,020
好吧 先生們

3830
01:39:17,390 --> 01:39:18,020
Alright gentlemen

3831
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:20,390
請翻到合約第四頁

3832
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:20,390
turn to page 4 of your contract and

3833
01:39:20,390 --> 01:39:22,630
這是第一組需要簽名的地方

3834
01:39:20,390 --> 01:39:22,630
that's the first set of signatures we need to go over.

3835
01:40:09,390 --> 01:40:11,180
我想問你一個問題

3836
01:40:09,390 --> 01:40:11,180
I just have to ask you one thing.

3837
01:40:11,490 --> 01:40:12,840
一件我一直不明白的事情

3838
01:40:11,490 --> 01:40:12,840
Something I've never understood.

3839
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:13,910
好的

3840
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:13,910
Alright.

3841
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:16,890
我們初遇那天

3842
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:16,890
That day we met

3843
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:18,600
我們帶你參觀了廚房

3844
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:18,600
when we gave you the tour

3845
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:20,580
嗯 那怎麼了？

3846
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:20,580
Uh huh. What about it?

3847
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:21,950
我們給你看了全部內容

3848
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:21,950
We showed you everything.

3849
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:24,960
完整的系統 我們全部的秘密

3850
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:24,960
The whole system, all of our secrets.

3851
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:25,980
我們是開放式的教學

3852
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:25,980
We were an open book.

3853
01:40:27,310 --> 01:40:28,740
而你為什麼不

3854
01:40:27,310 --> 01:40:28,740
So why didn't you just

3855
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:29,410
偷學它

3856
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:29,410
Steal it?

3857
01:40:29,470 --> 01:40:32,840
偷學你的方法自己運營

3858
01:40:29,470 --> 01:40:32,840
Just, grab your ideas and run off

3859
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:33,620
開始自己的生意

3860
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:33,620
start my own business

3861
01:40:33,620 --> 01:40:35,450
使用你們創造的方法

3862
01:40:33,620 --> 01:40:35,450
using all those ideas of yours.

3863
01:40:35,450 --> 01:40:36,090
我會失敗

3864
01:40:35,450 --> 01:40:36,090
It would have failed.

3865
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:36,860
你怎麼知道？

3866
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:36,860
How do you know?

3867
01:40:37,070 --> 01:40:39,350
我絕對不是唯一參觀過廚房的人

3868
01:40:37,070 --> 01:40:39,350
Am I the only one who got the kitchen tour?

3869
01:40:39,350 --> 01:40:40,480
你一定也邀請過其他人

3870
01:40:39,350 --> 01:40:40,480
You must have invited lots

3871
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:43,030
到廚房 對吧？

3872
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:43,030
of people back there, huh?

3873
01:40:43,310 --> 01:40:43,670
所以？

3874
01:40:43,310 --> 01:40:43,670
And?

3875
01:40:43,810 --> 01:40:45,140
他們有多少成功了？

3876
01:40:43,810 --> 01:40:45,140
How many of them succeeded?

3877
01:40:45,870 --> 01:40:47,450
很多人在做餐飲業

3878
01:40:45,870 --> 01:40:47,450
Lots of people started restaurants.

3879
01:40:47,530 --> 01:40:48,730
誰做到麥當勞了？

3880
01:40:47,530 --> 01:40:48,730
As big as McDonald's?

3881
01:40:48,970 --> 01:40:49,650
當然沒有

3882
01:40:48,970 --> 01:40:49,650
Of course not.

3883
01:40:50,410 --> 01:40:52,620
從沒有人做到過也不會再有人做到

3884
01:40:50,410 --> 01:40:52,620
No one ever has and no one ever will

3885
01:40:52,620 --> 01:40:55,680
因為他們都缺少一個東西

3886
01:40:52,620 --> 01:40:55,680
because they all lacked that one thing

3887
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:57,850
這個東西讓麥當勞與眾不同

3888
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:57,850
that makes McDonald's special.

3889
01:40:58,180 --> 01:40:58,830
是什麼？

3890
01:40:58,180 --> 01:40:58,830
Which is?

3891
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:03,430
即便你都不知道那是什麼

3892
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:03,430
Even you don't know what it is.

3893
01:41:03,430 --> 01:41:04,450
指引我

3894
01:41:03,430 --> 01:41:04,450
Enlighten me.

3895
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:08,210
不是快速系統 迪克

3896
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:08,210
It's not just the system, Dick.

3897
01:41:09,310 --> 01:41:09,950
而是這個名字

3898
01:41:09,310 --> 01:41:09,950
It's the name.

3899
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:12,450
這個榮耀的名字

3900
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:12,450
That glorious name,

3901
01:41:12,450 --> 01:41:13,160
麥當勞

3902
01:41:12,450 --> 01:41:13,160
McDonald's.

3903
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:17,720
它可以是你想要的任何東西

3904
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:17,720
It could be, anything you want it to be

3905
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:19,460
它是無限的 是開放的

3906
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:19,460
it's limitless, it's wide open...

3907
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:21,100
說出來 嗯

3908
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:21,100
it sounds, uh...

3909
01:41:22,310 --> 01:41:23,460
說出來就像

3910
01:41:22,310 --> 01:41:23,460
it sounds like...

3911
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:25,700
就像「美國」這個名字

3912
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:25,700
it sounds like America.

3913
01:41:27,150 --> 01:41:28,360
作為對比 克羅克 太繞嘴

3914
01:41:27,150 --> 01:41:28,360
let's compared to Kroc. What a crock.

3915
01:41:28,430 --> 01:41:30,090
克羅克太難發音

3916
01:41:28,430 --> 01:41:30,090
What a load of crock.

3917
01:41:30,090 --> 01:41:31,980
你願意在克羅克餐廳吃飯？

3918
01:41:30,090 --> 01:41:31,980
Would you eat at a place named Kroc's?

3919
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:35,420
克羅克是個生硬的斯拉夫發音

3920
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:35,420
Kroc's has that blunt, Slavic sound.

3921
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:36,160
克羅克

3922
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:36,160
Kroc's.

3923
01:41:36,540 --> 01:41:38,580
但是麥當勞 噢天吶

3924
01:41:36,540 --> 01:41:38,580
But McDonald's, oh boy.

3925
01:41:38,750 --> 01:41:39,620
太美好了

3926
01:41:38,750 --> 01:41:39,620
That's a beauty.

3927
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:41,670
是的

3928
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:41,670
Yeah...

3929
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:44,740
能叫做麥當勞的人

3930
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:44,740
A guy named McDonald

3931
01:41:46,690 --> 01:41:48,520
他從來不會為生活所迫

3932
01:41:46,690 --> 01:41:48,520
He's never gonna get pushed around in life.

3933
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:51,880
肯定不是我的生活

3934
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:51,880
That's clearly not the case.

3935
01:41:52,230 --> 01:41:54,560
難道你的口袋裏沒有

3936
01:41:52,230 --> 01:41:54,560
So, you don't have a check for

3937
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:57,720
一張135萬美元的支票嗎？

3938
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:57,720
1.35 million dollars in your pocket?

3939
01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:04,310
再見 迪克

3940
01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:04,310
Bye Dick.

3941
01:42:05,950 --> 01:42:08,040
如果你不能打敗他 那就買下他

3942
01:42:05,950 --> 01:42:08,040
So if you can't beat them, buy them.

3943
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:13,780
我記得第一次看到這個名字

3944
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:13,780
I remember the first time I saw that name

3945
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:15,940
當時就標識在你的店面之外

3946
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:15,940
stretched across your stand out there.

3947
01:42:17,450 --> 01:42:18,580
那是一見鍾情

3948
01:42:17,450 --> 01:42:18,580
It was love at first sight.

3949
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:20,510
就在那時那地 我意識到

3950
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:20,510
I knew right then and there...

3951
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:23,390
我要擁有它

3952
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:23,390
I had to have it.

3953
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:27,490
現在我有了

3954
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:27,490
And now I do.

3955
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:29,430
你沒有

3956
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:29,430
You don't, have it.

3957
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:34,100
你確定嗎？

3958
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:34,100
You sure about that?

3959
01:42:37,790 --> 01:42:38,310
再見 迪克

3960
01:42:37,790 --> 01:42:38,310
Bye Dick.

3961
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:49,290
作為您協議的條款

3962
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:49,290
As per the terms of your agreement, while you

3963
01:42:49,290 --> 01:42:51,520
你有權維護此位置的所有權

3964
01:42:49,290 --> 01:42:51,520
are entitled to maintain ownership of this location

3965
01:42:51,930 --> 01:42:53,800
但你不能再叫做 麥當勞

3966
01:42:51,930 --> 01:42:53,800
you no longer have the right to call it, McDonald's,

3967
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:55,990
麥當勞兄弟 或任何文字的變體

3968
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:55,990
McDonald, or any other such variations

3969
01:42:55,990 --> 01:42:57,620
避免以至混淆或者侵犯

3970
01:42:55,990 --> 01:42:57,620
so as to confuse or infringe

3971
01:42:57,870 --> 01:42:59,330
麥當勞 之註冊商標

3972
01:42:57,870 --> 01:42:59,330
upon the McDonald's trademark

3973
01:42:59,510 --> 01:43:01,280
現在 它已是雷蒙德·A.·克羅克先生的

3974
01:42:59,510 --> 01:43:01,280
which is now the exclusive intellectual

3975
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:02,900
專有知識產權

3976
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:02,900

Now, I know what you're thinking

3983
01:43:39,710 --> 01:43:41,970
一個52歲的傢伙

3984
01:43:39,710 --> 01:43:41,970
How the hell does a 52 year old

3985
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:44,920
一個過氣的奶昔機銷售員

3986
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:44,920
over- the- hill milkshake machine salesman

打造了一個擁有16,000家門店的速食帝國

3989
01:43:48,770 --> 01:43:51,570
遍佈50個州 5個國家

3990
01:43:48,770 --> 01:43:51,570
in 50 states, in 5 foreign countries

3991
01:43:51,650 --> 01:43:53,830
在這裏的年收入

3992
01:43:51,650 --> 01:43:53,830
wtih an annual revenue of in the

3993

有七億美元

3994
01:43:53,830 --> 01:43:56,390
neighborhood of $700,000,000.00...

3995
01:43:58,180 --> 01:43:58,980
一個詞

3996
01:43:58,180 --> 01:43:58,980
One word...

3997
01:44:00,590 --> 01:44:01,690
堅持

3998
01:44:00,590 --> 01:44:01,690
Persistence.

3999
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:10,790
這世界上沒什麼能代替堅持

4000
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:10,790
Nothing in this world can take the place of good old persistence.

4001
01:44:11,710 --> 01:44:12,610
天賦不能

4002
01:44:11,710 --> 01:44:12,610
Talent won't.

4003
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:16,970
我們常見到失敗的天賦異稟者

4004
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:16,970
Nothing's more common than unsuccessful men with talent.

4005
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:18,980
天才不能

4006
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:18,980
Genius won't.

4007
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:22,610
無法實現目標的天才早已是陳詞濫調

4008
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:22,610
Unrecognized genius is practically a cliche.

4009
01:44:22,990 --> 01:44:24,040
教育不能

4010
01:44:22,990 --> 01:44:24,040
Education won't.

4011
01:44:24,390 --> 01:44:27,110
這世界充斥著高學歷的傻瓜

4012
01:44:24,390 --> 01:44:27,110
Why the world is full of educated fools.

4013
01:44:27,510 --> 01:44:31,850
堅持和決心是所有的力量

4014
01:44:27,510 --> 01:44:31,850
Persistence and determination alone are all powerful.

4015
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:52,470
克洛克先生 我是比爾·戴維森

4020
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:55,840
pegged to the oppening of your 100th location.

4021
01:44:56,090 --> 01:44:57,200

4022
01:44:56,090 --> 01:44:57,200

當然 是

4024
01:44:58,450 --> 01:44:58,840
Sure thing.

4025
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:00,800
好吧

4026
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:00,800
Alright.

4027
01:45:02,510 --> 01:45:05,350
雷·克羅克 麥當勞創始人

4028
01:45:02,510 --> 01:45:05,350
Ray Kroc Founder

4029
01:45:11,690 --> 01:45:13,580
就是這些核心原則

4030
01:45:11,690 --> 01:45:13,580
It's these core principles

4031
01:45:13,580 --> 01:45:17,200
讓我不斷超越自己 走向人生巔峰

4032
01:45:13,580 --> 01:45:17,200
that enabled me to rise to the top of a heap at a point in life.

4033
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:20,400
而這時 其他人已經想著退休

4034
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:20,400
When most men would be thinking about retirement.

4035
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:22,500
貝弗利山 加州

4036
01:45:21,150 --> 01:45:23,560
我似乎和裏根州長有著相同點

4037
01:45:21,150 --> 01:45:23,560
Why, we appear to have that in common, governer Reagan.

4038
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:27,190
什麼點？你會55歲開始從政嗎？

4039
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:27,190
Why, you were what, 55 when you started in politics?

4040
01:45:28,140 --> 01:45:30,940
這就是為什麼我總是精力充沛

4041
01:45:28,140 --> 01:45:30,940
That's what you makes me look like a spring chicken.

4042
01:45:30,990 --> 01:45:32,300
笑 笑 笑

4043
01:45:30,990 --> 01:45:32,300
Laugh, laugh, laugh.

01:45:33,450 --> 01:45:34,180
Well, look at us.

Ah yes.

4060
01:45:50,810 --> 01:45:51,460
開頭

4061
01:45:50,810 --> 01:45:51,460
The beginning.

4062
01:45:52,670 --> 01:45:54,730
那時是1954年

4063
01:45:52,670 --> 01:45:54,730
The year was 1954.

4064

地點

4073
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:30,100
That's where it all started.

It was a typical, English American word.
