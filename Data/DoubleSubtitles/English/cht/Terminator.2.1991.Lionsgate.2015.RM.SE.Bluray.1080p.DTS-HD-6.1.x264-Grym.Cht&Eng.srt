I don't like to see the patients disrupting their rooms like this.

100
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:27,900

00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,412
來吧  寶貝
Come on, baby. Come on!

139
00:18:13,496 --> 00:18:15,748
- 好  - 成功了
- Yes! - Hey, it worked.

140
00:18:15,831 --> 00:18:19,502
好  賺到了  走
All right. Easy money. Come on!

141
00:18:22,004 --> 00:18:24,131
輕而易舉
Yes! Piece of cake.

142
00:18:29,387 --> 00:18:32,515
- 她就是你媽?  - 是的
- Is that her? - Yes.

143
00:18:32,598 --> 00:18:34,433
她似乎很酷嘛
She's pretty cool, huh?

144
00:18:34,517 --> 00:18:36,769
不  她是個神精病
No, she's a complete psycho.

145
00:18:36,852 --> 00:18:40,240
所以才被人關在精神病院
That's why she's at Pescadero. It's a mental institute.

146
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,800
她企圖炸毀一間電腦工廠
She tried to blow up a computer factory,

147
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,400
結果遭擊傷被捕
but got shot and arrested.

148
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,529
真糟
No shit.

149
00:18:47,238 --> 00:18:49,615
她是徹底的失敗者
She's a total loser.

150
00:18:49,699 --> 00:18:52,451
走  咱們去花點錢
Come on. Let's go spend some money.

151
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
莎拉
Sarah.

152
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,441
莎拉  醒醒
Sarah, wake up.

153
00:19:30,531 --> 00:19:32,241
凱爾
Kyle.

154
00:19:34,994 --> 00:19:36,287
你不是死了嗎?
You're dead.

155
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,414
我們的孩子呢?
Where's our son, Sarah?

156
00:19:39,415 --> 00:19:41,667
被他們帶走了
They took him away from me.

157
00:19:41,751 --> 00:19:44,962
- 他處在危險之中  - 我知道
- He's the target now. - I know.

158
00:19:45,046 --> 00:19:47,089
他孤立無援  你要去保護他
He's all alone. You have to protect him.

159
00:19:47,173 --> 00:19:49,500
我知道
I know.

160
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,100
你教我怎麼辦
You tell me how I'm supposed to do that.

161
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,513
他對我沒有信心
He doesn't even believe me anymore.

162
00:19:54,597 --> 00:19:58,500
- 我已經失去他了  - 你有能力
- I've lost him. - You're strong, Sarah.

163
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,145
比你認為的更有力量
Stronger than you ever thought you could be.

164
00:20:02,188 --> 00:20:03,720
起來抗爭  戰士
On your feet, soldier!

165
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:08,527
我愛你  莎拉  永遠愛你
I love you, Sarah. I always will.

166
00:20:10,821 --> 00:20:13,741
- 我需要你  - 我永遠在你左右
- I need you. - I'll always be with you.

167
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,600
還記得我的話嗎?
Remember the message?

168
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,200
一切尚未成為定局
The future is not set.

169
00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:27,755
未來仍可以自己去開創
There is no fate but what we make for ourselves.

170
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:49,652
別離開我
Stay with me.

171
00:20:50,611 --> 00:20:53,489
留給世界的時間所剩無幾
There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.

172
00:21:00,663 --> 00:21:02,500
凱爾  別走
Kyle, don't go!

173
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,800
凱爾
Kyle.

174
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:32,421
<i>我的眼睛</i>
<i>It's like a giant strobe light...</i>

175
00:22:32,504 --> 00:22:34,840
<i>感到一陣灼熱感</i>
<i>burning right through my eyes.</i>

176
00:22:38,844 --> 00:22:41,347
<i>但我似乎仍能看見</i>
<i>Somehow I can still see.</i>

177
00:22:47,228 --> 00:22:49,146
<i>老天</i>
<i>Oh, God.</i>

178
00:22:52,483 --> 00:22:55,945
<i>你們知道我的夢境每晚都一樣</i>
<i>We know the dream's the same every night.</i>

179
00:22:56,028 --> 00:22:59,448
<i>- 何必要...  - 請繼續</i>
<i>- Why do I have to... - Please continue.</i>

180
00:23:03,118 --> 00:23:05,871
<i>孩子們像紙一樣的燃燒</i>
<i>Children look like burnt paper.</i>

181
00:23:07,498 --> 00:23:09,625
<i>一片漆黑</i>
<i>Black.</i>

182
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,627
<i>無人倖免</i>
<i>Not moving.</i>

183
00:23:13,462 --> 00:23:15,881
<i>一切東西都被燒得面目全非</i>
<i>And then the blast wave hits them.</i>

184
00:23:25,182 --> 00:23:27,893
<i>像樹葉般四處散落</i>
<i>And they fly apart like leaves.</i>

185
00:23:29,645 --> 00:23:33,023
<i>你的夢把世界末日</i>
<i>Dreams of cataclysm, the end of the world...</i>

186
00:23:33,107 --> 00:23:35,025
<i>描述地很好</i>
<i>are very common.</i>

187
00:23:36,735 --> 00:23:40,990
<i>這不是夢  這場核戰是真的</i>
<i>It's not a dream, you moron. It's real.</i>

188
00:23:41,073 --> 00:23:44,994
<i>- 我知道這一切將要發生  - 你的夢很有真實感</i>
<i>- I know the date it happens. - I'm sure it feels real to you.</i>

189
00:23:45,077 --> 00:23:47,579
<i>1997年8月29日那天</i>
<i>On August 29, 1997...</i>

190
00:23:47,663 --> 00:23:51,166
<i>你也會有完全一樣的感受</i>
<i>it's gonna feel pretty fuckin' real to you too!</i>

191
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,920
<i>沒有擦幾萬層防曬油的人都會很慘的</i>
<i>Anybody not wearing two-million sunblock is gonna have a real bad day.</i>

192
00:23:55,004 --> 00:23:56,922
<i>- 懂嗎?  - 別激動</i>
<i>- Get it? - Stop.</i>

193
00:23:57,006 --> 00:23:59,883
<i>你們無能為力</i>
<i>God, you think you're safe and alive.</i>

194
00:23:59,967 --> 00:24:02,261
<i>你們都會死掉</i>
<i>You're already dead. Everybody!</i>

195
00:24:02,344 --> 00:24:04,847
<i>聽好  你們都會死掉</i>
<i>Him. You. You're dead already.</i>

196
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,808
<i>這兒的一切將消失無蹤</i>
<i>This whole place, everything you see is gone!</i>

197
00:24:07,891 --> 00:24:11,979
<i>做夢的人是你們  我保證  你們若再不清醒</i>
<i>You're the one living in the dream, 'cause I know it happens!</i>

198
00:24:12,062 --> 00:24:14,023
<i>就"美夢"成真了</i>
<i>It happens!</i>

199
00:24:24,992 --> 00:24:27,995
我現在好多了
I feel much better now.

200
00:24:28,078 --> 00:24:29,955
清醒了
Clearer.

201
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,833
沒錯  你最近的態度
Yes, your attitude has been...

202
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:35,210
的確改善不少
much improved lately.

203
00:24:44,553 --> 00:24:47,056
你說我的生活應該有個目標
It's helped me to have a goal...

204
00:24:47,139 --> 00:24:50,309
找件我很希望做的事
something to look forward to.

205
00:24:50,392 --> 00:24:51,560
什麼事?
What is that?

206
00:24:51,643 --> 00:24:53,979
你說過
Well, you said...

207
00:24:54,063 --> 00:24:57,900
我的病情若有改善
that if I showed improvement after six months...

208
00:24:57,983 --> 00:25:00,652
你會送我到管理較松的醫院
you would transfer me to the minimum security wing...

209
00:25:00,736 --> 00:25:03,489
而且可以讓我會客
and I could have visitors.

210
00:25:05,115 --> 00:25:09,161
現在已經過去六個月了
Well, it's been six months and...

211
00:25:10,287 --> 00:25:12,581
我很想見見我兒子
I was looking forward to seeing my son.

212
00:25:13,624 --> 00:25:15,084
我明白了
I see.

213
00:25:18,337 --> 00:25:22,508
咱們再談談你提到的終結者機器
Let's go back to what you were saying about those Terminator machines.

214
00:25:23,675 --> 00:25:27,054
你現在認為它們不存在了?
Now you think they don't exist?

215
00:25:27,137 --> 00:25:31,266
它們不存在  我現在知道了
They don't exist. I know that now.

216
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,520
你反覆提及砸爛過一個終結者
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one...

217
00:25:34,603 --> 00:25:36,688
那又怎麼解釋
in a hydraulic press.

218
00:25:38,065 --> 00:25:41,193
我若做過這事  應該會有證據留下
If I had, there would have been some evidence.

219
00:25:41,276 --> 00:25:43,695
他們應該會在那工廠找到殘骸
They would have found something at the factory.

220
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:45,864
我懂了
I see.

221
00:25:45,948 --> 00:25:49,368
<i>你不認為電腦公司掩飾了一切?</i>
<i>So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?</i>

222
00:25:51,662 --> 00:25:54,540
<i>不  它們為何要如此?</i>
<i>No. Why would they?</i>

223
00:25:54,748 --> 00:25:57,876
- 換個位置  - 好
- Let's try a new position right there. - Okay.

224
00:25:58,449 --> 00:26:02,427
所有感應系統運作正常

225
00:26:02,489 --> 00:26:04,485
對  這是新的零件

226
00:26:05,506 --> 00:26:07,479
線路有點故障

227
00:26:07,803 --> 00:26:09,304
戴森先生
Mr. Dyson?

228
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:13,809
材料小組準備要...
The materials team is running another...

229
00:26:13,892 --> 00:26:15,561
- 戴森先生  - 怎麼啦?
- Mr. Dyson. - Yes?

230
00:26:15,644 --> 00:26:18,605
材料小組下午要做實驗
The materials team is running another series this afternoon.

231
00:26:18,689 --> 00:26:21,650
你得簽字同意
You have to sign for the... it.

232
00:26:21,733 --> 00:26:24,570
- 把"它"拿出來  - 好的  我懂了
- You have to sign it out. - Okay. I'll get it.

233
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,431
戴森先生
Listen, Mr. Dyson,

234
00:26:27,531 --> 00:26:28,800
我知道我剛進公司
I know I haven't been here long,

235
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,580
但你是否可以告訴我...
but I was wondering if you know...

236
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,035
告訴你什麼?
Know what?

237
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:34,750
你知不知道"它"是哪兒來的?
If you know where "it" came from.

238
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,600
我也問過這個問題
I asked them the same question once.

239
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,200
他們的回答是
You know what they told me?

240
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,100
"別問"
Don't ask.

241
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,000
你好  戴森先生
Good morning, Mr. Dyson.

242
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,050
- 還好嗎?  - 還好
- How's it going? - Okay.

243
00:26:49,344 --> 00:26:52,264
插入鑰匙  左向  三
Insert key. Left on three.

244
00:26:52,347 --> 00:26:54,683
二  一  轉
Two, one, turn.

245
00:26:57,769 --> 00:26:59,500
- 你老婆孩子還好吧  - 很好  謝謝
- How are the wife and kids? - Great. Thanks.

246
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,300
好了
Here you go.

247
00:27:28,217 --> 00:27:31,261
你覺得如何  大夫?
So what do you think, Doctor?

248
00:27:32,137 --> 00:27:34,097
我有進步  是吧?
Haven't I shown improvement?

249
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:38,143
莎拉  問題是
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

250
00:27:39,228 --> 00:27:41,647
我知道你有多聰明
I know how smart you are.

251
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,774
你是挑我愛聽的講
You're just telling me what I want to hear.

252
00:27:44,816 --> 00:27:47,861
我認為你根本言不由衷
I don't think you really believe what you're telling me today.

253
00:27:47,945 --> 00:27:51,865
你想調到管理寬鬆的醫院  只是想逃
If I put you in minimum security, you'll just try to escape again.

254
00:27:56,703 --> 00:27:58,997
你得讓我看看我兒子
You have to let me see my son.

255
00:28:00,249 --> 00:28:01,833
求求你
Please.

256
00:28:03,488 --> 00:28:04,478
求求你
Please.

257
00:28:05,796 --> 00:28:09,007
他有生命危險  他需要我幫助
He's in great danger. He's naked without me.

258
00:28:10,425 --> 00:28:11,885
讓我打個電話也行
If I could make a phone call...

259
00:28:11,969 --> 00:28:14,429
不行  一會兒也不行
I'm afraid not. Not for a while.

260
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,101
我別無選擇
I don't see any choice but to recommend to the review board...

261
00:28:19,184 --> 00:28:21,770
只好再關你半年
that you stay here for another six months.

262
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:28,235
我要殺了你  混蛋
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

263
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:32,480
- 你這禽獸  - 抓住她
- You son of a bitch! - Get her off!

264
00:28:32,739 --> 00:28:35,500
給她打鎮靜劑
Ten CCs of sodium amobarbital, stat!

265
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,800
你們這些混蛋
You don't know what you're doing!

266
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,500
快拿藥來
Get some restraints in here now!

267
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:45,127
死到臨頭了還不覺悟
You don't know what you're doing!

268
00:28:48,964 --> 00:28:51,258
<i>真是個模範公民</i>
<i>Model citizen.</i>

269
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,780
"目標確認"

270
00:29:30,297 --> 00:29:33,008
你剛好錯過  15分鐘前他們剛走
You just missed him. He was here 15 minutes ago.

271
00:29:33,091 --> 00:29:36,260
- 他們好像要去加利瑞購物中心  - 對
- He was going to the galleria. - Yeah.

272
00:29:36,345 --> 00:29:37,900
加利瑞?
The galleria?

273
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,561
- 我去換些銅板  馬上回來  - 好
- I'm gonna get some quarters. I'll be back, all right? - Cool.

274
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,360
- 噢  不  - 小姑娘  你們認識約翰·康納嗎?
- Oh, no! - Girls, do you know John Connor?

275
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
不認識
No.

276
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:50,794
嘿  你認識這個孩子嗎?
Hey, do you know this kid?

277
00:30:50,877 --> 00:30:53,046
不  我不認識他
Nah, I don't know him.

278
00:30:58,385 --> 00:31:00,762
- 約翰  - 現在不行
- John. - Not now.

279
00:31:00,846 --> 00:31:04,099
有個條子在找你  快瞧
There's this cop scoping for you. Check it out.

280
00:31:06,643 --> 00:31:08,562
- 他就在那邊  - 快溜
- He's right over there. - Split, man.

281
00:31:08,645 --> 00:31:11,106
- 快走  - 好
- Just go. - Yeah.

282
00:31:15,819 --> 00:31:17,070
你在找的人好像往那兒...
I saw that kid...

283
00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:34,337
嘿  你不能跑到這裏來
Hey! You're not supposed to be in here!

284
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:01,000
趴下
Get down.

285
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,229
先生  你沒事吧?
Mister, are you all right?

286
00:33:15,397 --> 00:33:16,565
你沒事吧?
You all right?

287
00:33:31,871 --> 00:33:33,081
快啊
Come on!

288
00:34:12,954 --> 00:34:14,414
該死
Goddamn!

289
00:38:53,526 --> 00:38:56,237
靠到路邊  停車
Okay, time-out. Stop the bike.

290
00:38:56,321 --> 00:38:58,907
停下來
Time-out. Come on, stop the bike.

291
00:39:12,003 --> 00:39:14,714
天啊  別會錯意了
Holy shit. Now, don't take this the wrong way.

292
00:39:14,797 --> 00:39:17,175
- 你是終結者  對吧?  - 對
- You are a Terminator, right? - Yes.

293
00:39:17,258 --> 00:39:20,200
生化機械  模型101
Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.

294
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,480
不可能吧
No.

295
00:39:31,689 --> 00:39:33,608
好傢伙
Holy shit.

296
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:37,695
你真像真的人
You're really real.

297
00:39:37,779 --> 00:39:39,739
我是說
I mean...

298
00:39:42,241 --> 00:39:45,203
你骨子裏是機器人  對吧?
You're like a machine underneath, right?

299
00:39:45,286 --> 00:39:46,788
可外表是人形
But alive outside?

300
00:39:46,871 --> 00:39:48,790
內部是機械骨架
I'm a cybernetic organism.

301
00:39:48,873 --> 00:39:51,584
外部是真皮
Living tissue over metal endoskeleton.

302
00:40:06,391 --> 00:40:08,559
真帥
This is intense.

303
00:40:08,643 --> 00:40:11,437
約翰  清醒一下
Get a grip, John. Okay.

304
00:40:14,023 --> 00:40:16,150
你不是來殺我的
You're not here to kill me.

305
00:40:16,234 --> 00:40:20,196
這一點我知道  那你到底要怎樣?
I figured that part out for myself. So what's the deal?

306
00:40:20,279 --> 00:40:22,360
我的任務是要保護你
My mission is to protect you.

307
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,000
是嗎?  誰派你來的?
Yeah? Who sent you?

308
00:40:26,911 --> 00:40:29,038
是你  35年後的你
You did. Thirty-five years from now...

309
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:33,126
派我來保護現在的你
you reprogrammed me to be your protector here in this time.

310
00:40:33,209 --> 00:40:35,962
真深奧
Oh, this is deep.

311
00:40:58,401 --> 00:41:01,100
那傢伙跟你一樣是終結者?
So this other guy, he's a Terminator like you, right?

312
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,360
跟我不同  它是T-1000  是更先進的模型
Not like me. A T-1000, advanced prototype.

313
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,619
你是說它比你更先進?
Your mean more advanced than you are?

314
00:41:08,703 --> 00:41:13,207
- 對  它是特種合金製造  - 那是什麼意思?
- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy. - What the hell does that mean?

315
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:17,545
- 液態金屬  - 我們去哪兒?
- Liquid metal. - Where are we going?

316
00:41:17,628 --> 00:41:20,965
你得立刻離開這座城市  這樣才能逃避它的追殺
We have to get out of the city immediately and avoid the authorities.

317
00:41:21,048 --> 00:41:24,140
我想回家去  收拾些東西再走
I gotta stop by my house. I wanna pick up some stuff.

318
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,639
否決  T-1000它一定會在那等你的
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely try to reacquire you there.

319
00:41:28,723 --> 00:41:31,476
- 你確定?  - 我確定
- You sure? - I would.

320
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:44,780
陶德和吉納會有危險
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

321
00:41:47,033 --> 00:41:48,493
我至少得警告他們
but I gotta warn 'em.

322
00:41:48,576 --> 00:41:50,953
可惡  你有銅板嗎?
Shit. You got a quarter?

323
00:41:59,712 --> 00:42:02,715
- 喂  <i>- 吉納  是我</i>
- Hello. <i>- Janelle, it's me.</i>

324
00:42:02,799 --> 00:42:05,176
- 約翰?  <i>- 一切都好嗎?</i>
- John? <i>- Is everything all right?</i>

325
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:07,678
- 你們都沒事吧?  <i>- 當然  甜心  一切都很好</i>
- Are you guys okay? <i>- Sure, honey, everything's okay.</i>

326
00:42:07,762 --> 00:42:10,848
- 你沒事吧?  <i>- 我很好</i>
- Are you all right? <i>- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

327
00:42:10,932 --> 00:42:14,519
約翰  天晚了  我很擔心你
John, it's late. I was beginning to worry about you.

328
00:42:14,602 --> 00:42:17,313
你趕快回來  我們一起吃晚餐
If you hurry home, we can sit down and have dinner together.

329
00:42:17,396 --> 00:42:18,940
我正在煮牛肉呢
I'm making beef stew.

330
00:42:19,023 --> 00:42:21,280
不對勁  她對我從沒這麼好過
Somethings wrong. She's never this nice.

331
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,820
約翰  你在哪兒?
John? Where are you?

332
00:42:23,903 --> 00:42:26,781
那隻狗在鬼叫什麼勁?
What the hell is the goddamn dog barking at?

333
00:42:26,864 --> 00:42:30,117
閉嘴  你這一文不值的廢物
Hey, shut up, you worthless piece of shit!

334
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:31,661
狗在吠叫
The dog's really barking.

335
00:42:31,744 --> 00:42:34,120
叫那小鬼把那雜種狗丟掉
You were gonna tell the kid to get rid of that mutt.

336
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:40,628
約翰  天晚了  別害我擔心
John, it's late. Please don't make me worry.

337
00:42:40,711 --> 00:42:42,421
他已經在那裏了嗎?
Could he already be there?

338
00:42:43,548 --> 00:42:44,841
甜心  你沒事吧
Honey, are you okay?

339
00:42:44,924 --> 00:42:48,928
- 我在這兒  我沒事  <i>- 真的嗎?</i>
- I'm right here. I'm fine. <i>- Are you sure you're all right?</i>

340
00:42:49,011 --> 00:42:52,100
- 狗叫什麼名字?  - 麥克斯
- What's the dog's name? - Max.

341
00:42:52,431 --> 00:42:54,767
吉納  伍飛怎麼了?
Hey, Janelle. What's wrong with Wolfie?

342
00:42:54,851 --> 00:42:57,436
我聽見它在叫  它沒事吧?
I can hear him barking. Is he okay?

343
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,240
伍飛很好  甜心  它很好
Wolfie's fine, honey. Wolfie's just fine.

344
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,800
你在哪兒?
Where are you?

345
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,300
你的養父母都死了
Your foster parents are dead.

346
00:43:43,691 --> 00:43:45,693
說清楚點
I need a minute here.

347
00:43:45,776 --> 00:43:50,114
你說這機器能模仿一切事物?
You're telling me that this thing can imitate anything it touches?

348
00:43:50,197 --> 00:43:53,117
只要它能接觸到的都行
Anything it samples by physical contact.

349
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,619
厲害
Get real.

350
00:43:54,702 --> 00:43:58,456
那它也能變成一包香煙?
It could disguise itself as a pack of cigarettes?

351
00:43:58,539 --> 00:44:00,500
不行  只能變成類似它大小的物體
No, only an object of equal size.

352
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,120
那為何不變成顆炸彈來殺我?
Why not just become a bomb or something to get me?

353
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,212
它無法變成很複雜的機器
It can't form complex machines.

354
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,480
像槍枝  炸藥  化學品等
Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.

355
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:11,093
但它可以變出一個固態金屬形狀
It doesn't work that way. But it can form solid metal shapes.

356
00:44:11,177 --> 00:44:14,221
- 像是什麼?  - 像刀  能刺的武器
- Like what? - Knives and stabbing weapons.

357
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,100
"麥克斯"

358
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:47,213
這些是電視監視器照的
These were taken by a video surveillance camera...

359
00:44:47,296 --> 00:44:50,800
1984年  在西城警局
at the West Highland Police Station in 1984.

360
00:44:52,176 --> 00:44:54,360
那晚他殺了17名警察
He killed 17 police officers that night.

361
00:44:56,597 --> 00:44:58,641
都是有家室的人
Men with families...

362
00:45:00,226 --> 00:45:01,644
有子女
children.

363
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:05,648
這是今天在一個購物中心照的
These were taken at a mall in Reseda...

364
00:45:05,731 --> 00:45:07,942
就在今天
today.

365
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:12,321
康納小姐  我們知道你認得此人
Miss Connor, we know you know who this guy is.

366
00:45:15,741 --> 00:45:19,495
我還要告訴你  令郎也失蹤了
I just sat here and told you that your son is missing...

367
00:45:19,578 --> 00:45:22,415
他的養父母雙雙遇害
that the foster parents have been murdered.

368
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,540
我們知道此人涉有重嫌
We know this guy's involved.

369
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:28,629
此事你一點也不關心?  你關心嗎?
Doesn't that mean anything to you? Don't you care?

370
00:45:33,509 --> 00:45:37,000
我們是在浪費時間  咱們走
We're wasting our time. Let's go.

371
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,360
抱歉各位
Sorry, guys.

372
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:44,186
她越來越與現實生活脫節了
She's grown more disconnected from reality as time goes on.

373
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:46,480
恐怕她幫不了你們的忙
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

374
00:45:46,564 --> 00:45:49,775
也許等她神智清醒時就可以了  我會通知你們的
If she clears at all and can give us anything, I'll call you.

375
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:51,485
好吧
Sure.

376
00:45:51,569 --> 00:45:54,576
道格  請帶她回房去
Douglas, take her back to her room, please.

377
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,781
是
Yes, sir.

378
00:45:57,324 --> 00:45:59,452
我們走
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

379
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:01,579
好長一段時間
You see...

380
00:46:01,662 --> 00:46:04,874
我們曾在尼加拉瓜或其他的地方待過
we spent a lot of time in Nicaragua and places like that.

381
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:10,463
她有陣子跟退役的綠色貝雷帽士兵混
For a while there, she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy...

382
00:46:10,546 --> 00:46:11,922
弄了不少槍
running guns.

383
00:46:12,006 --> 00:46:14,925
然後又找了些人
Then there were some other guys.

384
00:46:15,009 --> 00:46:17,011
她向任何可以學習的人吸取經驗
She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from...

385
00:46:17,094 --> 00:46:20,347
以便將我造就成偉大的軍事領袖
so she could teach me how to be this great military leader.

386
00:46:22,099 --> 00:46:24,101
後來她被捕了
Then she gets busted.

387
00:46:24,185 --> 00:46:27,813
我媽瘋狂的舉動把我也弄糊塗了
It's like, "Sorry, kid, your mom's a psycho. Didn't you know?"

388
00:46:30,024 --> 00:46:33,944
好像她教我相信的一切是狗屎
Like everything I've been brought up to believe is all made-up bullshit.

389
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
我痛恨這一點
I hated her for that.

390
00:46:40,034 --> 00:46:42,578
但她說的一切都是真的
But everything she said was true.

391
00:46:43,871 --> 00:46:45,831
她知道的
She knew...

392
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,086
但沒人肯相信她
and nobody believed her...

393
00:46:51,837 --> 00:46:53,756
連我在內
not even me.

394
00:46:55,716 --> 00:46:57,593
我們得把她弄出醫院
Listen. We gotta get her out of there.

395
00:46:57,676 --> 00:47:01,055
否決  T-1000精明狡猾
Negative. The T-1000's highest probability for success now...

396
00:47:01,138 --> 00:47:04,183
現在可能已經變成莎拉·康納  等你去自投羅網
will be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.

397
00:47:04,266 --> 00:47:06,352
那她會怎樣?
Great. What happens to her?

398
00:47:06,435 --> 00:47:09,313
模仿的對象必須消滅
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.

399
00:47:09,396 --> 00:47:12,650
糟了  你怎麼不早說?  我們得馬上走
Shit! Why didn't you tell me? We gotta go right now!

400
00:47:12,733 --> 00:47:14,819
否決  這不是我任務的重點
Negative. It's not a mission priority.

401
00:47:14,902 --> 00:47:17,071
但這是我的重點
Fuck you! She's a priority to me!

402
00:47:18,906 --> 00:47:22,910
混蛋  你是怎麼回事?  救命
Goddamn it! What's your problem? Help!

403
00:47:22,993 --> 00:47:24,787
這對我們的任務毫無用處
This does not help our mission.

404
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:27,331
救命  把這瘋子趕走
Get this psycho off of me! Help!

405

I'm being kidnapped! Get this psycho off of me!

406
00:47:30,543 --> 00:47:31,585
放手
Let me go!

407
00:47:36,132 --> 00:47:37,925
你為何那樣做?
Why did you do that?

408
00:47:38,008 --> 00:47:39,927
因為你命令我"放手"
Because you told me to.

409
00:47:42,763 --> 00:47:44,181
什麼?
What?

410
00:47:49,228 --> 00:47:51,188
你得照我的話去做  對吧?
You have to do what I say?

411
00:47:51,272 --> 00:47:53,482
那是我任務的一個最高原則
That's one of my mission parameters.

412
00:47:54,775 --> 00:47:58,100
證明呀  用一隻腳站立
Prove it. Stand on one foot.

413
00:48:00,781 --> 00:48:01,824
好

真酷  只聽我命令的終結者
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

415

你沒事吧  孩子?
You okay, kid?

416
00:48:10,457 --> 00:48:11,834
滾開  別煩我
Take a hike, bozo.

417
00:48:11,917 --> 00:48:14,503
我們別插手啦
Let's get outta here, man.

418
00:48:14,587 --> 00:48:16,540
去你的  混球
Fuck you, you little dipshit!

419
00:48:17,256 --> 00:48:18,674
混球?
Dipshit?

420
00:48:20,843 --> 00:48:22,970
把腳放下
Put your leg down.

421
00:48:23,053 --> 00:48:27,892
- 你敢叫<i>我</i>混球  - 只是想幫忙
- Did you call <i>moi</i> a dipshit? - Just trying to help this punk.

422
00:48:27,975 --> 00:48:30,311
給這小子點顏色瞧瞧
Grab this guy.

423
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,150
放開我
Get him off of me!

424
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,274
現在誰是混球?
Now who's the dipshit...

425
00:48:35,357 --> 00:48:37,151
- 你個草包  - 放手
- you jock douche bag? - Get off!

426
00:48:44,441 --> 00:48:45,440
不
No.

427
00:48:46,243 --> 00:48:48,704
把槍放下  快
Put the gun down now!

428
00:48:48,787 --> 00:48:51,999
- 離開這兒  - 兄弟  咱們快走
- Get outta here! - Come on. Let's split!

429
00:48:58,964 --> 00:49:00,883
天呀  你會把那人給殺了
You were gonna kill that guy!

430
00:49:00,966 --> 00:49:03,135
當然  我是終結者
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

431
00:49:05,346 --> 00:49:07,973
仔細聽我說  好嗎?
Listen to me very carefully, okay?

432
00:49:08,057 --> 00:49:11,393
你現在不再是終結者  好嗎?
You're not a Terminator anymore, all right?

433
00:49:11,477 --> 00:49:13,896
聽懂了嗎?
You got that?

434
00:49:13,979 --> 00:49:16,232
你就是不能隨便到處殺人
You just can't go around killing people.

435
00:49:16,315 --> 00:49:17,358
為什麼?
Why?

436
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:20,486
什麼意思?  反正就是不行
What do you mean, why? 'Cause you can't.

437
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:21,480
為什麼?
Why?

438
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:24,540
因為你就是不能  好嗎?  這件事你得信任我
Because you just can't, okay? Trust me on this.

439
00:49:30,412 --> 00:49:33,874
我要去救我媽
Look. I'm gonna go get my mom.

440
00:49:33,958 --> 00:49:36,794
我命令你要協助我
I order you to help me.

441
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:06,777
莎拉·康納在這裏嗎?
You have a Sarah Connor here?

442
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,529
你來遲了  是嗎?
You're runnin' kind of late.

443
00:52:08,612 --> 00:52:10,989
他們已經來了一個多小時
They've been in there for an hour.

444
00:52:11,073 --> 00:52:13,492
等一下  我替你通知
Hold on a second. I'll buzz you in.

445
00:52:15,327 --> 00:52:19,206
你的朋友來了
Oh, here come your friends now.

446
00:53:20,934 --> 00:53:24,354
- 葛蘭  要咖啡嗎?  - 不  謝了

- Hey, I got a full house. - That's good, Louis.

449
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:56,929
我走運了
Must be my lucky day.

450
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:22,240
你說得沒錯
You're right about number 24.

451
00:56:22,324 --> 00:56:25,327
給24號病房增加藥劑量吧
Increase the medication to 250 milligrams.

452
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:27,720
- 還用同一種藥嗎?  - 對
- Same kind? - Mm-hmm.

453
00:56:43,011 --> 00:56:45,430
你
You!

454
00:56:47,933 --> 00:56:49,851
你弄斷我的手臂了
You broke my arm.

455
00:56:49,935 --> 00:56:52,729
人體內有215塊骨頭
There are 215 bones in the human body.

456
00:56:52,813 --> 00:56:55,399
不過是斷一根而已  不准動
That's one. Now, don't move.

457
00:56:56,524 --> 00:57:00,497
"排水管洗潔劑  有毒"

458
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,900
你想幹什麼?
What are you going to do?

459
00:57:06,576 --> 00:57:08,662
我們停下來幹什麼?
Why do we stop now?

460
00:57:09,955 --> 00:57:13,750
你得保證絕不殺人  好嗎?
You gotta promise me you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

461
00:57:13,834 --> 00:57:16,420
- 好  - 你發誓
- Right. - Swear?

462
00:57:16,503 --> 00:57:18,004
什麼?
What?

463
00:57:18,088 --> 00:57:21,174
舉手說  "我絕不殺人"
Just put up your hand and say, "I swear I won't kill anyone."

464
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:25,095
我發誓我不殺任何人
I swear I will not kill anyone.

465
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,720
好  咱們走

00:57:42,696 --> 00:57:45,323
王八蛋  你開槍打我
You son of a bitch! You shot me!

470
00:57:47,117 --> 00:57:48,410
瘋子
Crazy bastard!

別再開槍了  別殺我
Don't shoot me again. Don't kill me.

472

Son of a bitch!

別緊張
Take it easy, Sarah.

479
00:58:28,658 --> 00:58:31,787
行不通的  我知道你不是殺手
It won't work. You're no killer. I don't believe you can do it.

480
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:34,831
反正你們都得死  索大夫  你知道我很認真
You're already dead. Everybody dies. You know I believe it.

481
00:58:34,915 --> 00:58:36,958
別跟我耍花招

約翰
John.

你來開
You, drive.

527
01:06:28,513 --> 01:06:30,723
甩掉他了  後面沒人
He's not back there. There's nobody behind us.

528
01:06:30,807 --> 01:06:32,800
- 你沒事吧?  - 沒事
- Are you all right? - Yeah.

529
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,720
你看的到路?
Can you see anything?

530
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:38,900
我看的一清二楚
I see everything.

Come here.

534

我說過我沒事
I said I was okay.

535
01:06:57,208 --> 01:07:00,378
約翰  你來找我真是愚蠢
John, it was stupid of you to go there.

536
01:07:01,254 --> 01:07:03,589
你該有自知之明的
You have to be smarter than that.

537
01:07:03,673 --> 01:07:05,300
你差點連命都送掉
You were almost killed.

538
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,400
你到底在想什麼?
What were you thinking?

539
01:07:09,095 --> 01:07:11,780
你不該冒險  為我也不行
You cannot risk yourself, even for me.

540
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,976
你的命太重要了
Do you understand? You're too important.

541
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:17,729
你懂嗎?
Do you understand?

542
01:07:20,606 --> 01:07:21,733
可是...
But...

543
01:07:23,609 --> 01:07:27,113
我必須把你從那兒就出來  對不起
I had to get you out of that place. I'm sorry.

544
01:07:28,364 --> 01:07:30,742
我不需要你協助  我自有辦法
I didn't need your help. I can take care of myself.

545
01:07:37,957 --> 01:07:39,584
你的眼睛怎麼了?
What's wrong with your eyes?

546
01:07:41,544 --> 01:07:42,962
沒什麼
Nothing.

547
01:07:52,889 --> 01:07:55,350
你又是什麼來頭?
So, what's your story?

548
01:08:05,902 --> 01:08:06,986
你沒事?
You okay?

549
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:08,488
很好
Fine.

550
01:08:10,323 --> 01:08:13,659
這機車真不錯
Say, that's a nice bike.

551
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:37,850
輕點行嗎?  老粗
Watch it, lug nuts.

552
01:08:45,358 --> 01:08:48,778
你知道自己在幹什麼嗎?
Listen, do you know what you're doing?

553
01:08:48,861 --> 01:08:51,656
我對人體構造非常瞭解
I have detailed files on human anatomy.

554
01:08:52,573 --> 01:08:54,534
我想也是
I bet.

555
01:08:54,617 --> 01:08:57,620
那使你更容易殺人  是吧?
Makes you a more efficient killer, right?

556
01:08:57,703 --> 01:08:58,830
沒錯
Correct.

557
01:09:04,877 --> 01:09:06,879
你被擊中時會痛嗎?
Does it hurt when you get shot?

558
01:09:07,922 --> 01:09:11,384
我感到受損  亦可稱為"疼痛"
I sense injuries. The data could be called "pain."

559
01:09:13,719 --> 01:09:15,638
約翰  幫我調整燈光
John, help me with the light.

560
01:09:15,721 --> 01:09:18,015
- 會痊瘉嗎?  - 會的
- Will these heal up? - Yes.

561
01:09:18,099 --> 01:09:22,000
那就好  你若不像人  對我們就沒用
Good. If you can't pass for human, you're not much good to us.

562
01:09:22,395 --> 01:09:25,106
你能活多久?
How long do you live? I mean, last. Whatever.

563
01:09:25,189 --> 01:09:28,484
我的電池可維持120年
A hundred and twenty years with my existing power cell.

564
01:09:28,568 --> 01:09:31,487
你能學習你電腦中還未輸入過的事嗎?
Can you learn stuff that you haven't been programmed with...

565
01:09:31,571 --> 01:09:32,989
使你能夠
so you can be...

566
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,951
更像人類?
you know, more human...

567
01:09:37,034 --> 01:09:39,480
這樣你才不會像個傻蛋
and not such a dork all the time?

568
01:09:42,915 --> 01:09:46,461
我的中央處理器是神經元處理器  也是學習型電腦
My CPU is a neural net processor, a learning computer.

569
01:09:46,544 --> 01:09:50,600
我們外出時天網會將開關設置為"只可讀取"
But Skynet presets the switch to read-only when we're sent out alone.

570
01:09:52,258 --> 01:09:54,677
它不想讓你有其他思想?
Doesn't want you to do too much thinking, huh?

571
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,095
不可以
No.

572
01:09:57,638 --> 01:09:59,932
能重新設定嗎?
Can we reset the switch?

573
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:22,413
把轉子逆時針轉動
Rotate the two locking cylinders counterclockwise.

574
01:10:28,294 --> 01:10:29,795
動手
Do it.

575
01:10:38,095 --> 01:10:40,431
把蓋子扭開
Now open the port cover.

576
01:10:42,975 --> 01:10:45,520
用力拔出來
Pull to break the seal.

577
01:10:48,648 --> 01:10:52,652
現在把芯片取出來
Good, now remove the shock-damping assembly.

578
01:10:56,197 --> 01:10:59,367
可以看到中央處理器了
You can now access the CPU.

579
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:01,827
- 看見了嗎?  - 看見了
- Do you see it? - Yes.

580
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:04,100
鉗住處理器突起部分
Hold the CPU by its base tab.

581
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,700
"槽口打開"

582
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,333
拔出來
Pull.

583
01:11:44,704 --> 01:11:46,414
看見開關了嗎?
Do you see the pin switch?

584
01:11:46,497 --> 01:11:48,374
不要
No! No!

585
01:11:49,375 --> 01:11:52,003
- 與你無關  - 別毀滅他
- Out of my way, John. - Don't kill him.

586
01:11:52,086 --> 01:11:55,381
是"它"  不是"他"  "它"
It, John, not him. It.

587
01:11:55,464 --> 01:11:58,926
好的  是"它"  但我們需要"它"
Okay, it. But we need it.

588
01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:01,637
好好聽我說
Listen to me. You listen.

589
01:12:01,721 --> 01:12:03,848
依靠自己的力量比較好
We're better off on our own.

590
01:12:03,931 --> 01:12:05,725
可他是證據
But he's the only proof we have...

591
01:12:05,808 --> 01:12:08,311
是戰爭以及未來之事的唯一證據
of the future and the war and all that.

592
01:12:08,394 --> 01:12:09,770
也許
Maybe.

593
01:12:12,398 --> 01:12:14,442
可我始終信不過它
I don't trust it.

594
01:12:14,525 --> 01:12:16,235
他是我的朋友  對吧?
But he's my friend, all right?

595
01:12:17,069 --> 01:12:19,822
你根本不知道"它"到底要殺誰
You don't know what it's like to try to kill one of these things...

596
01:12:19,905 --> 01:12:23,492
為了以防萬一  這是最後機會  動手吧
and if something goes wrong this could be our last chance, so move!

597
01:12:23,576 --> 01:12:25,661
如果我真是未來領袖
If I'm ever supposed to be this great military leader...

598
01:12:25,745 --> 01:12:29,582
那你總該聽一次領袖的意見吧?
maybe you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.

599
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,120
如果親生母親都不聽我的話
Because if my own mother won't,

600
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,800
那又怎能指望別人?
how do you expect anyone else to?

601
01:12:51,437 --> 01:12:54,482
好吧  聽你的吧
All right, play it your way.

602
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:00,400
"系統中斷"

603
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:01,800
"診斷"

604
01:13:01,947 --> 01:13:03,991
有問題嗎?
Was there a problem?

605
01:13:04,075 --> 01:13:05,576
沒問題
No problem.

606
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,720
即便有  我也擺平了
None whatsoever.

607
01:13:42,154 --> 01:13:44,073
現在開始學習吧
Are we learning yet?

608
01:13:56,502 --> 01:13:59,463
我們得盡量遠離這座城市
We have to get as far away from the city as possible.

609
01:14:03,175 --> 01:14:04,802
往南走
Just head south.

610
01:14:13,561 --> 01:14:15,146
時速別超過65英里
Keep it under 65.

611
01:14:15,229 --> 01:14:18,232
- 否則會被交警攔下  - 確認
- We don't want to be pulled over. - Affirmative.

612
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,300
不  不不
No, no, no.

613
01:14:21,444 --> 01:14:23,946
你得學人類說話的方式
You gotta listen to the way people talk.

614
01:14:24,029 --> 01:14:27,533
你不能說"確認"那種鳥話
You don't say "affirmative" or some shit like that.

615
01:14:27,616 --> 01:14:29,952
你要說  <i>"沒問題"</i>
You say, <i>"No problemo."</i>

616
01:14:30,035 --> 01:14:33,956
如果有人找碴  你就說  "有種試試看"
If someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say, "Eat me."

617
01:14:34,039 --> 01:14:38,335
如果要解決掉他們  就說<i>"拜拜了  寶貝"</i>
And if you want to shine them on, it's <i>"Hasta la vista, baby."</i>

618
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:41,000
拜拜了  寶貝
Hasta la vista, baby.

619
01:14:41,547 --> 01:14:43,674
對  或者說  "去死吧  精蟲"
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."

620
01:14:43,757 --> 01:14:46,802
有人生氣  你就說  "冷靜點"
If someone gets upset, you say, "Chill out."

621
01:14:46,886 --> 01:14:48,262
或者你也可以自由發揮
Or you can do combinations.

622
01:14:49,054 --> 01:14:51,348
冷靜點  精蟲
Chill out, dick-wad.

623
01:14:52,183 --> 01:14:54,185
對  看  你真的會了
That's great. See? You're getting it.

624
01:14:54,494 --> 01:14:55,470
沒問題
No problemo.

625
01:15:06,405 --> 01:15:08,282
你身上帶錢了嗎?
You got any cash?

626
01:15:08,365 --> 01:15:11,911
有幾百塊  分你一半
I got a couple hundred bucks. I'll give you half.

627
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:13,000
媽
Mom!

628
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:16,720
我去買點吃的
Get some food.

629
01:15:18,834 --> 01:15:21,253
一點幽默感都沒有
No sense of humor.

630
01:15:26,675 --> 01:15:30,262
還有件事  你要放鬆點
That's another thing. You can lighten up a bit yourself.

631
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:33,349
一本正經已經很老土了
This severe routine is getting old, okay.

632
01:15:33,432 --> 01:15:35,267
你得這學著風趣一點
I mean, you're acting like such a geek.

633
01:15:35,351 --> 01:15:37,353
時常微笑一下
Smile once in a while.

634
01:15:37,436 --> 01:15:38,771
微笑
Smile?

635
01:15:38,854 --> 01:15:42,775
對  微笑  看著
Yeah, you know, smile. Watch.

636
01:15:43,776 --> 01:15:47,488
嗨  真是個好地方  生意不錯吧?
Hi. Nice place you got here. How's business?

637
01:15:48,447 --> 01:15:50,282
別搗亂
Give me a break.

638
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,202
演砸了
Okay, bad example.

639
01:15:54,328 --> 01:15:55,996
看見那個小伙子了嗎?
See that guy over there?

640
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,957
那就是微笑
That's a smile.

641
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:01,500
"動作選擇"

642
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:07,450
"分析"

643
01:16:17,309 --> 01:16:18,769
不錯
That's good.

644
01:16:18,852 --> 01:16:21,814
找個鏡子多練習一下吧
Maybe you could practice in front of a mirror or something.

645
01:16:29,071 --> 01:16:30,990
要吃點薯條嗎?
Want some of my fries?

646
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,460
- 你需要幫忙嗎?  - 不用
- Need any help? - No.

647
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:46,000
- 我殺死你了  - 不  你沒有
- I got you! - No, you didn't!

648
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:48,240
- 你死了  - 才沒有呢
- I got you! - No, you didn't!

649
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,500
去你的  混球
I got you!

650
01:16:54,972 --> 01:16:57,975
我們撐不過去  對吧
We're not gonna make it, are we?

651
01:17:00,019 --> 01:17:01,228
我是指人類
People, I mean.

652
01:17:04,398 --> 01:17:06,480
你們天性便有自我毀滅傾向
It's in your nature to destroy yourselves.

653
01:17:07,318 --> 01:17:10,237
對  真無聊  是吧?
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

654
01:17:10,321 --> 01:17:13,574
快住手  要不掐斷你們脖子
Break it up before I wring both of your necks.

655
01:17:15,367 --> 01:17:18,454
我要知道"天網"系統的起源
I need to know how Skynet gets built.

656
01:17:18,537 --> 01:17:19,788
是誰研究出來的?
Who's responsible?

657
01:17:19,872 --> 01:17:23,417
直接負責的人是莫斯·戴森
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennett Dyson.

658
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,210
誰呀?
Who is that?

659
01:17:25,294 --> 01:17:29,214
塞柏電腦公司特別企劃室主任
He's the director of special projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

660
01:17:32,009 --> 01:17:33,761
為何是他?
Why him?

661
01:17:33,844 --> 01:17:37,360
數月內他會研製出新型微電腦
In a few months, he creates a revolutionary type of microprocessor.

662
01:17:38,265 --> 01:17:39,900
然後呢?
Go on. Then what?

663
01:17:40,726 --> 01:17:43,646
三年內塞柏會成為軍方電腦來源
In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier...

664
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,480
負責高階研發
of military computer systems.

665
01:17:46,190 --> 01:17:49,109
所有轟炸機都會裝載塞柏的電腦系統
All Stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers...

666
01:17:49,193 --> 01:17:50,653
成為無人操作機型
becoming fully unmanned.

667
01:17:50,736 --> 01:17:53,781
然後它創造了完美的運作記錄
Afterwards they fly with a perfect operational record.

668
01:17:53,864 --> 01:17:56,492
天網計劃法案正式通過
The Skynet funding bill is passed.

669
01:17:56,575 --> 01:17:59,870
1997年8月4日  電腦系統上線
The system goes on-line on August 4, 1997.

670
01:17:59,953 --> 01:18:03,123
它迅速掌握戰略防衛系統
Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.

671
01:18:03,207 --> 01:18:05,918
天網電腦以極快速度吸取經驗
Skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate.

672
01:18:06,001 --> 01:18:10,800
它產生自我意識  時間為8月29日上午2時14分
It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29.

673
01:18:11,382 --> 01:18:13,967
人類驚慌失措  準備應變
In a panic, they try to pull the plug.

674
01:18:15,094 --> 01:18:17,346
- 但天網卻先發制人  - 是的
- Skynet fights back. - Yes.

675
01:18:17,429 --> 01:18:20,182
它向俄羅斯境內目標發射飛彈
It launches its missiles against the targets in Russia.

676
01:18:20,265 --> 01:18:23,310
為何攻擊俄國?  他們現在不是我們的朋友嗎?
Why attack Russia? Aren't they our friends now?

677
01:18:23,394 --> 01:18:27,900
天網知道俄方反擊便可消滅美國
Skynet knows the Russian counterattack will eliminate its enemies over here.

678
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,480
天啦
Jesus.

679
01:18:32,111 --> 01:18:34,360
你對戴森瞭解多少?
How much do you know about Dyson?

680
01:18:36,198 --> 01:18:38,117
我有他的詳細資料
I have detailed files.

681
01:18:39,326 --> 01:18:41,286
我要知道一切
I want to know everything.

682
01:18:42,496 --> 01:18:46,583
他的長相  住址  一切
What he looks like, where he lives, everything.

683
01:18:58,220 --> 01:18:59,638

<i>莫斯</i>
<i>Miles.</i>

685
01:19:21,910 --> 01:19:23,662
你打算工作一整天嗎?
Are you going to work all day?

686
01:19:23,745 --> 01:19:27,624
對不起  這玩意兒很傷腦筋
I'm sorry, baby. But this thing is just kicking my ass.

687
01:19:27,708 --> 01:19:29,001
今天是禮拜天
Miles, it's Sunday.

688
01:19:29,084 --> 01:19:31,837
你答應帶孩子去水上樂園的
You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.

689
01:19:33,422 --> 01:19:34,923
不行吧
I can't...

690
01:19:35,591 --> 01:19:37,301
我忙死了
I'm on a roll.

691
01:19:50,147 --> 01:19:52,357
親愛的  這東西面世後會轟動全球的
Baby, this is going to blow them all away.

692
01:19:52,441 --> 01:19:55,527
- 神經元處理器  - 你說過的
- It's a neural net processor. - I know. You told me.

693
01:19:55,611 --> 01:19:58,800
這是神經元處理器  可以像人類一樣思考
It's a neural net processor. It thinks and learns like we do.

694
01:19:58,850 --> 01:20:01,533
是常溫條件下的超導體
It's superconducting at room temperature.

695
01:20:01,617 --> 01:20:05,871
其他電腦就像計算器一樣弱智
Other computers are just pocket calculators by comparison.

696
01:20:07,789 --> 01:20:10,042
真的這麼重要嗎?
But why is that so goddamn important, Miles?

697
01:20:10,125 --> 01:20:11,460
我真的想知道
I really need to know...

698
01:20:11,543 --> 01:20:14,630
有時候我真的要瘋了
because sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy here.

699
01:20:16,298 --> 01:20:18,300
親愛的  我快成功了
Baby, I am this close.

700
01:20:19,384 --> 01:20:20,427
過來
Come here.

701
01:20:23,055 --> 01:20:25,557
想像一下  一架噴氣機
Imagine a jet airliner...

702
01:20:25,641 --> 01:20:28,310
上面的機師永不疲倦  永不出錯
with a pilot that never gets tired, never makes mistakes...

703
01:20:28,393 --> 01:20:30,480
不會像個醉貓跑來上班
never shows up to work with a hangover.

704
01:20:32,648 --> 01:20:35,067
來見過這位機師
Meet the pilot.

705
01:20:35,150 --> 01:20:38,237
我們為什麼要結婚?  為什麼要生孩子?
Why did we get married, Miles? Why did we have these children?

706
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,363
你根本不需要我們
You don't need us.

707
01:20:39,446 --> 01:20:42,866
你的身心全在這裏
Your heart and your mind are in here.

708
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:45,960
可這東西不會像我們一樣愛你
But it doesn't love you like we do.

709
01:20:54,002 --> 01:20:56,630
我很抱歉  真的
I'm sorry. Really.

710
01:20:56,713 --> 01:21:00,968
帶孩子們出去玩吧
How about spending some time with your other babies?

711
01:21:03,637 --> 01:21:05,472
<i>水上樂園</i>
<i>Raging Waters!</i>

712
01:21:35,127 --> 01:21:36,900
在車上等著
Wait in the car.

713
01:22:15,292 --> 01:22:17,360
你真性急  康納
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

714
01:22:18,511 --> 01:22:20,510
你也是
You too.

715
01:22:37,898 --> 01:22:39,650
約翰
Hey, big John.

716
01:22:40,275 --> 01:22:41,401
你好
What's up?

717
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:42,900
他是誰?
Who is this guy?

718
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,988
他沒問題  他跟我來的
He's cool, Enrique. He's with me.

719
01:22:45,072 --> 01:22:48,241
他是  包伯叔
He's... Uncle Bob.

720
01:22:48,325 --> 01:22:50,535
包伯叔  這是恩裏克
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

721
01:22:50,619 --> 01:22:52,371
包伯叔?
Uncle Bob, huh?

722
01:22:53,455 --> 01:22:55,480
好吧  自己人
Okay.

723
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:02,900
要喝嗎?
Drink?

724
01:23:08,095 --> 01:23:09,513
包伯叔?
"Uncle Bob"?

725
01:23:11,515 --> 01:23:14,309
你們很有名  都上了電視
You're pretty famous, all over the goddamn TV.

726
01:23:14,393 --> 01:23:17,062
條子就像瘋狗似的
Pictures of you, John, your big friend here.

727
01:23:17,145 --> 01:23:19,106
想揪你們出來呢
Cops are going nuts looking for you.

728
01:23:23,026 --> 01:23:26,988
我需要衣物  食物  和一輛卡車
I just came for my stuff. I need clothes, food and a truck.

729
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,300
要不要我連假牙都一起給你?
How about the fillings in my teeth?

730
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,500
現在就要
Now, Enrique.

731
01:23:32,703 --> 01:23:35,180
你們也去  去拿武器
You two, you're on weapons detail.

732
01:23:35,576 --> 01:23:36,665
走吧
Come on, let's go.

733
01:23:57,269 --> 01:23:59,187
我媽有個特點
One thing about my mom...

734
01:24:01,481 --> 01:24:03,442
她總是未雨綢繆
she always plans ahead.

735
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:15,328
好極了
Excellent.

736
01:24:25,964 --> 01:24:29,634
這是最好的車  但缺起動馬達
This is my best truck, but the starter motor's gone.

737
01:24:29,718 --> 01:24:31,636
你有時間等它裝好嗎?
You got time to change it out?

738
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:35,056
- 可以  我要等午夜之後再越過邊境  - 那好
- Yeah. I'm gonna wait till dark to cross the border. - Okay.

739
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:36,641
恩裏克
Enrique.

740
01:24:36,725 --> 01:24:40,480
這裏很危險  今晚你也得離開
It's dangerous for you here. You get out tonight too, okay?

741
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:42,240
好的
Sure.

742
01:24:42,981 --> 01:24:46,777
我早把生死置之度外
Just drop by anytime and totally fuck up my life, all right?

743
01:24:51,198 --> 01:24:54,659
我在這種地方長大
See, I grew up in places like this...

744
01:24:54,743 --> 01:24:57,162
我還以為人就是這樣過活
so I just thought that's how people lived...

745
01:24:58,497 --> 01:25:01,208
駕駛著直升機
riding around in helicopters...

746
01:25:02,292 --> 01:25:04,503
學習如何炸東西
learning how to blow shit up.

747
01:25:06,004 --> 01:25:08,673
我媽媽被捕後
But then when my mom got busted...

748
01:25:08,757 --> 01:25:11,134
我被送進學校
I got put into a regular school.

749
01:25:11,802 --> 01:25:14,554
發現其他孩子都在玩任天堂
All the other kids were into Nintendo.

750
01:25:28,819 --> 01:25:30,946
你害怕過嗎?
Are you ever afraid?

751
01:25:31,029 --> 01:25:32,322
沒有
No.

752
01:25:36,201 --> 01:25:37,994
也沒怕過死?
Not even of dying?

753
01:25:38,537 --> 01:25:40,000
沒有
No.

754
01:25:44,835 --> 01:25:48,900
你對死亡從來都無動於衷?
You don't feel any emotion about it, one way or another?

755
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:53,200
是的  任務完成前  我得保持機體穩定運行
No. I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.

756
01:25:58,139 --> 01:26:01,268
所以死不足懼
Then it doesn't matter.

757
01:26:01,351 --> 01:26:05,063
我也得保持穩定  "我太重要了"
I have to stay functional too. "I'm too important."

758
01:26:21,329 --> 01:26:23,206
很適合你
That's definitely you.

759
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:37,360
與我媽來往的男人都是怪人
Most of the guys my mom hung around with were geeks...

760
01:26:37,596 --> 01:26:41,099
但有個傢伙倒很酷
but there was this one guy, he was kinda cool.

761
01:26:41,182 --> 01:26:43,101
他教我玩這些
He taught me engines.

762
01:26:43,184 --> 01:26:45,353
撐住這兒
Hold here.

763
01:26:45,437 --> 01:26:47,856
後來他們還是分手了
Mom screwed it up, of course.

764
01:26:47,939 --> 01:26:50,358
她總是在談審判日等等之類的話題
She'd always tell 'em about Judgment Day...

765
01:26:50,442 --> 01:26:53,236
也許直到今天
and me being this world leader.

766
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:55,280
她腦裏仍只想這一件事
That'd be all she wrote.

767
01:26:56,615 --> 01:26:58,000
請把鉗子給我
Torque wrench, please.

768
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:00,900
拿去
Here.

769
01:27:01,286 --> 01:27:04,400
真希望能見到我生父
I wish I could've met my real dad.

770
01:27:04,581 --> 01:27:06,240
你會的
You will.

771
01:27:06,416 --> 01:27:08,585
對
Yeah, I guess.

772
01:27:08,668 --> 01:27:12,000
那時我已經45歲了
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

773
01:27:12,589 --> 01:27:16,301
我會派他回到1984年
They sent him back through time to 1984.

774
01:27:16,384 --> 01:27:17,802
天啦
Man.

775
01:27:19,346 --> 01:27:21,806
他現在還沒出生呢
He hasn't even been born yet.

776
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,518
真不可思議
It messes with your head.

777
01:27:28,271 --> 01:27:31,191
- 把螺絲帽給我  - 給
- The other bolt. - Oh. Here.

778
01:27:37,530 --> 01:27:41,076
她只和他共處了一個晚上
Mom and him were only together for one night.

779
01:27:41,159 --> 01:27:43,620
我想她仍愛著他
She still loves him, I guess.

780
01:27:43,703 --> 01:27:46,581
有時我看見她在哭
I see her crying sometimes.

781
01:27:46,665 --> 01:27:50,669
當然啦  她完全否認  她說那是有異物吹進眼裏
She denies it totally, of course, like she got something stuck in her eye.

782
01:27:55,632 --> 01:27:57,050
你們為何哭泣?
Why do you cry?

783
01:27:58,259 --> 01:27:59,761
- 你是說人類?  - 對
- You mean people? - Yeah.

784
01:27:59,844 --> 01:28:01,221
我不知道
I don't know.

785
01:28:01,304 --> 01:28:03,390
他們就是會哭
We just cry...

786
01:28:03,473 --> 01:28:06,017
尤其是"傷心"的時候
you know, when it hurts.

787
01:28:12,107 --> 01:28:13,858
是"傷"造成的?
Pain causes it?

788
01:28:14,943 --> 01:28:17,070
不  那不一樣
No. It's different.

789
01:28:17,153 --> 01:28:20,448
雖然你沒事  但傷心時就會哭
It's when there's nothing wrong with you, but you hurt anyway.

790
01:28:20,532 --> 01:28:22,117
- 懂嗎?  - 不懂
- You get it? - No.

791
01:28:23,368 --> 01:28:25,078
那才像話
All right, my man!

792
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:26,600
沒問題
No problemo.

793
01:28:26,913 --> 01:28:28,540
擊掌慶祝
Give me five.

794
01:28:30,583 --> 01:28:32,800
像這樣撐開手掌  來
Just put out your hand like this, come on.

795
01:28:34,045 --> 01:28:38,383
很好  拍打我的手  該你了  你來擊掌
All right! Now hit me. Give me five. Do the same thing.

796
01:28:38,473 --> 01:28:39,449
很好
All right!

797
01:28:43,096 --> 01:28:45,557
好  很好  來個高的
Okay, that's good. Up high.

798
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:47,500
低的
Five low.

799
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:49,640
你慢了
Too slow.

800
01:28:52,564 --> 01:28:54,816
我是在開玩笑  再來一次
I'm just kidding. One more time.

801
01:28:54,899 --> 01:28:57,110
很好  接著來
Good. Now try it.

802
01:28:57,193 --> 01:28:59,154
來  打我一掌
Now do me. Give me five.

803

命運是要自己開創的
No fate but what we make.

823
01:33:41,978 --> 01:33:43,980
我的父親告訴她的
My father told her this.

824
01:33:46,524 --> 01:33:50,820
是未來的我讓我父親告訴她的
I made him memorize it in the future as a message to her.

825
01:33:52,488 --> 01:33:54,407
算了
Never mind.

826
01:33:54,490 --> 01:33:57,827
整件事就是這樣
Okay, the whole thing goes...

827
01:33:57,910 --> 01:34:00,621
一切尚未成為定局
The future's not set.

828
01:34:00,705 --> 01:34:04,208
未來仍可以自己去開創
There's no fate but what we make for ourselves.

829
01:34:04,292 --> 01:34:07,295
她想改變未來?
She intends to change the future.

830
01:34:07,378 --> 01:34:08,838
對  我猜也是
Yeah, I guess.

831
01:34:10,381 --> 01:34:12,216
糟了
Oh, shit!

832
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:14,218
- 戴森  - 對
- Dyson. - Yeah.

833
01:34:14,302 --> 01:34:17,805
一定是的  莫斯·戴森
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

834
01:34:17,889 --> 01:34:19,891
她想要殺了戴森
She's gonna blow him away.

835
01:34:19,974 --> 01:34:22,060
來  咱們走
Come on! Let's go!

836
01:34:22,448 --> 01:34:23,431
快啊
Come on!

837
01:34:34,447 --> 01:34:36,491
事實上  這樣做非常危險
This is tactically dangerous.

838
01:34:36,574 --> 01:34:37,700
開快點
Drive faster.

839
01:34:37,784 --> 01:34:40,286
T-1000跟我一樣瞭解情況
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.

840
01:34:40,369 --> 01:34:43,790
它知道我知道的一切  它還能預測敵人的行動
It knows what I know. It might anticipate this move.

841
01:34:43,873 --> 01:34:46,000
我不管  咱們得阻止她
I don't care. We gotta stop her.

842
01:34:46,459 --> 01:34:48,540
殺死戴森的確有可能阻止戰爭
Killing Dyson might prevent the war.

843
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:52,400
我不管  你還沒學通嗎?
I don't care! Haven't you learned anything yet?

844
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:55,200
你還不明白為何不能亂殺人嗎?
Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?

845
01:34:58,012 --> 01:35:00,515
聽著  也許你不在乎生死
Look, maybe you don't care if you live or die...

846
01:35:00,598 --> 01:35:02,767
可並非所有人都這樣
but everybody's not like that.

847
01:35:02,850 --> 01:35:06,437
人類有感情  會受到傷害  會感到恐懼
We have feelings. We hurt. We're afraid.

848
01:35:08,940 --> 01:35:12,540
這種東西你要理解  我不是開玩笑  真的很重要
You got to learn this stuff. I'm not kidding. It's important.

849
01:35:50,273 --> 01:35:52,900
丹尼  叫你去睡覺  我說真的
Danny, I told you to go to bed, like your sister.

850
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,720
再玩一會兒就好  媽
Just a couple of minutes, Mom!

851
01:36:12,503 --> 01:36:14,839
丹尼  睡覺時間到了
Danny, your time is up!

852
01:36:14,922 --> 01:36:17,842
快刷牙上床
Come brush your teeth and get to bed.

853
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:47,500
丹尼
Danny.

854
01:36:59,576 --> 01:37:00,640
爸
Daddy!

855
01:37:01,052 --> 01:37:03,554
這不是遊戲  快逃
Danny, go! Go!

856
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:06,300
莫斯
Miles.

857
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:13,940
- 特瑞莎  跑  - 我的天啊
- Tarissa, run! - Oh, my God!

858
01:37:21,030 --> 01:37:23,074
快帶丹尼走  快逃
Just take Danny and run!

859
01:37:23,157 --> 01:37:24,408
快逃
Run!

860
01:37:24,492 --> 01:37:26,244
我的天呀
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

861
01:37:45,137 --> 01:37:46,138
爹地
Daddy!

862
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:47,300
丹尼
Danny.

863
01:37:47,848 --> 01:37:49,308
誰都不許動
Nobody fucking move!

864
01:37:50,142 --> 01:37:51,394
別傷害我爸
Don't hurt my daddy!

865
01:37:51,477 --> 01:37:53,020
趴到地上
On the floor, bitch.

866
01:37:53,104 --> 01:37:55,000
趴下
Get down now!

867
01:37:56,148 --> 01:37:57,233
讓開
Get out of the way!

868
01:37:57,316 --> 01:37:58,776
別傷害他
Don't hurt him!

869
01:38:00,278 --> 01:38:02,280
讓開  否則我開槍
Get on the floor now!

870
01:38:05,324 --> 01:38:07,034
饒了孩子吧
Just let the boy go.

871
01:38:07,118 --> 01:38:08,703
你閉嘴
Shut up. Shut up.

872
01:38:08,786 --> 01:38:10,079
閉嘴
Shut up!

873
01:38:10,162 --> 01:38:12,748
都是你的錯  混蛋
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

874
01:38:12,832 --> 01:38:15,084
- 都是你的錯  - 什麼?
- It's all your fault! - What?

875
01:38:15,167 --> 01:38:17,295
我不會讓你得逞的
I'm not gonna let you do it.

876
01:39:09,305 --> 01:39:11,390
糟了  太遲了
Shit! We're too late!

877
01:39:15,895 --> 01:39:17,021
看看他們
Check them.

878
01:39:20,691 --> 01:39:22,693
看著我  媽
Look at me, Mom.

879
01:39:22,777 --> 01:39:24,987
你受傷了?
Are you hurt?

880
01:39:25,457 --> 01:39:26,436
看著我
Look at me.

881
01:39:28,616 --> 01:39:30,701
我幾乎
I almost...

882
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:32,500
我下不了手
I almost...

883
01:39:42,338 --> 01:39:44,673
放心吧
It'll be okay.

884
01:39:44,757 --> 01:39:46,717
一定還有辦法的  真的
We'll figure something out. Okay?

885
01:39:48,302 --> 01:39:49,929
相信我吧
I promise.

886
01:39:53,224 --> 01:39:56,185
你是來阻止我的?
You came here to stop me.

887
01:39:57,061 --> 01:39:59,021
對
Yeah, I did.

888
01:40:01,899 --> 01:40:03,901
我愛你  約翰
I love you, John.

889
01:40:05,569 --> 01:40:07,154
我一直愛著你
I always have.

890
01:40:09,073 --> 01:40:10,491
我知道
I know.

891
01:40:17,498 --> 01:40:19,708
子彈貫穿
Deep penetration.

892
01:40:21,293 --> 01:40:23,212
沒有擊碎骨頭
No shattered bone.

893
01:40:23,295 --> 01:40:26,257
把傷口壓著就能止住血了
Hold here. The pressure should stop the bleeding.

894
01:40:37,017 --> 01:40:38,436
你們是誰?
Who are you people?

895
01:40:39,395 --> 01:40:40,813
告訴他
Show him.

896
01:40:43,482 --> 01:40:47,653
丹尼  你跟我走好嗎?  帶我看看你房間
Danny, I want you to come with me right now. Show me your room.

897
01:41:28,152 --> 01:41:29,361
我的天呀
Oh, my God.

898
01:41:29,445 --> 01:41:32,114
仔細聽我說
Now listen to me very carefully.

899
01:41:37,995 --> 01:41:42,124
<i>戴森聽著終結者的解說</i>
<i>Dyson listened while the Terminator laid it all down.</i>

on things I haven't even done yet.

我怎會知道?
How were we supposed to know?

909
01:42:21,497 --> 01:42:23,180
對
Yeah.

910
01:42:23,541 --> 01:42:25,360
沒錯
Right.

你怎會知道?
How were you supposed to know?

你以為你很有創造力
You think you're so creative.

916
01:42:44,311 --> 01:42:47,398
你根本就不知道創造的意義
You don't know what it's like to really create something...

917
01:42:47,481 --> 01:42:49,608
創造生命
to create a life...

01:42:49,692 --> 01:42:51,235
是感覺它在體內成長
to feel it growing inside you.

919
01:42:51,318 --> 01:42:54,238
你只會創造死亡和毀滅
All you know how to create is death and destruction.

媽
Mom!

921
01:42:56,073 --> 01:42:59,827

We need to be a little more constructive here. Okay?

922
01:42:59,910 --> 01:43:02,360
我們仍要阻止戰爭的  對吧?
We still have to stop this from happening, don't we?

923
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:04,915
但我以為
But I thought...

924
01:43:04,999 --> 01:43:09,003
我們是要通過改變現在的事  從而改變未來的事嗎?
Aren't we changing things right now, changing the way it goes?

925
01:43:09,086 --> 01:43:10,200
沒錯
That's right.

926
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:13,540
本來就快做出超級新電腦
There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor. Not now.

927
01:43:13,966 --> 01:43:17,428
現在一切免談  我不幹了  我明天就辭職
Forget it. I'm out of it. I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.

928
01:43:17,511 --> 01:43:19,388

That's not good enough.

不能讓別人繼續完成你的工作
No one must follow your work.

930
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:23,000
好吧
Right.

931
01:43:23,434 --> 01:43:27,771
那得摧毀實驗室的一切裝備
All right, then we have to destroy all the stuff at the lab...

- Do you know about the chip? - What chip?

938
01:43:40,868 --> 01:43:43,640
他們把它鎖在金庫裏  是跟你一樣的機器人身上的
It's at Cyberdyne. It's from the other one like you.

混蛋  我就知道
Son of a bitch! I knew it!

941
01:43:48,626 --> 01:43:51,337
他們不准我們問晶片是哪兒來的
They told us not to ask where they got it.

942
01:43:51,420 --> 01:43:53,756
真聰明的混蛋
Those lying motherfuckers.

It didn't work, but it gave us ideas, took us in new directions.

必須摧毀它
It must be destroyed.

01:45:33,856 --> 01:45:35,607
你休想妄動
Don't even think about it.

964
01:45:46,577 --> 01:45:48,036
行了
It's okay.

965
01:45:49,455 --> 01:45:52,610
開金庫要兩把鑰匙  而且得同時插入旋轉
It takes two keys, turned simultaneously, to open the vault.

966
01:45:52,666 --> 01:45:55,586
另一支在警衛室裏
The other one is in a locker at the security station.

969

你不能擅離崗位的
You can't leave the desk like that!

970

吉文
Gibbons!

971
01:46:11,268 --> 01:46:12,770

Oh, shit.

972
01:46:30,329 --> 01:46:32,331
我的卡片應該可以開啟它
My card should access this.

973
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:36,860
什麼?
What?

974
01:46:37,002 --> 01:46:39,421
- 怎麼回事?  - 可惡
- What is it? - Damn it.

975
01:46:39,505 --> 01:46:41,465
警報器已經啟動
The silent alarm's been tripped.

976
01:46:47,638 --> 01:46:50,390
它使所有啟動密碼都失效了
It's neutralized all the codes in the entire building.

977
01:46:50,474 --> 01:46:52,392
現在到處都不通了
Nothing will open anywhere now.

978
01:46:53,477 --> 01:46:55,312
我們得放棄此事
We have to abort.

979
01:46:55,485 --> 01:46:56,481
不
No.

980
01:46:58,524 --> 01:47:01,944
我們幹到底
We go all the way. Okay?

981
01:47:04,071 --> 01:47:07,866
你們在實驗室開始行動  我能打開這個
You guys get started on the lab. I can open this.

982
01:47:07,950 --> 01:47:10,410
- 是大鬧商場的傢伙  - 是那傢伙
- I think it's that guy from the mall. - It is.

983
01:47:10,494 --> 01:47:12,412
對  是他和那女人
Yeah. It's him and the woman.

984
01:47:13,997 --> 01:47:17,167
立即總動員到這裏來
Just send everything you got in the area right now.

985
01:47:19,378 --> 01:47:22,840
我的私人密碼可能還能通
I have a personal entry code for the lab. It may still work.

986
01:47:27,344 --> 01:47:28,387
沒有用
It's no good.

987
01:47:28,470 --> 01:47:30,013
試試我的法子
Let me try mine.

988

約翰  小心
John, fire in the hole!

989
01:47:49,116 --> 01:47:53,912
且慢  現在不能進去  火焰啟動了"海龍消防系統"
Wait! You can't go in there. The fire set off the Halon system.

990
01:48:01,086 --> 01:48:03,547
等幾分鐘  要讓毒氣消散
You have to wait until the gas clears.

991
01:48:06,049 --> 01:48:07,342
戴防毒面具
Put this on.

992
