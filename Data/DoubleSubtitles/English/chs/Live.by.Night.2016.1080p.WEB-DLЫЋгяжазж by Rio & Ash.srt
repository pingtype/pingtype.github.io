Nickel and diming with two dumb guineas.

They're your friends, but they're stupid

多切斯特人
Dorchester.

00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,512
不 我是问你到美国之前 很显然你是爱尔兰人
No, I meant before.
You're clearly Irish.

95
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,848
我妈妈的家庭来自柯克

- 你不知道吗
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

98
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:36,555
我妈妈很早就去世了 所以--
She died. She's dead, my mum, so...

99
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,061
那么 你是做什么的
So, what is it you do?

100
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:48,300
这里真是个虚荣和炫耀的地方 对吧
It's a real swank place, this, isn't it?

101
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,936
我知道我儿子靠什么生活
I'm aware of how my son earns a living.

102
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:53,805
所以我估计你跟我儿子的相识
I can only assume that if you've come into
contact with him

103
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,607
不是在犯罪现场
it was either during a crime

104
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:58,810
就是在某些残暴之人聚集的场合
or in an establishment
populated by rough characters.

105
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:04,216
我的问题让你不舒服了吗
Are my questions making you feel uncomfortable?

106
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:06,451
我不明白你想说什么
I don't know what you're on about.

107
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,820
但是实话讲 我一点不在乎
And to be honest, I don't really care.

108
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:12,691
我想说的是 你是那种会和犯罪分子勾搭在一起的人
I'm on about you being the type of Lassie
who consorts with criminals.

109
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:15,560
我不在乎我儿子是不是犯罪分子
The fact that the criminal is my son
isn't the issue.

110
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:18,330
我儿子始终是我儿子 这一点不会改变
It is that my son is still my son.

111
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,099
现在他却和你这种
And I have feelings that cause me

112
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,702
自愿伴随在犯罪分子和危险人物左右的人一起
to question the wisdom of consorting with
the type of woman

113
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:26,605
让我怀疑他的选择是否理智
who knowingly consorts with criminals.

114
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:29,774
- 你听懂了吗
- 好了 爸爸 说够了没有
- Did you follow all that?
- Enough, dad. Enough. Okay?

115
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:33,712
我叔叔提到过一个拿钱替他卖命的警察姓Coughlin
My uncle mentioned a copper on his payroll,
name of Coughlin.

116
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,580
那是你吧
Is that you?

117
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:41,386
你说的叔叔是不是叫Robert
This uncle would be your uncle Robert?

118
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:44,122
人们都叫他Bobo 对吗
Who everyone knows as Bobo?

119
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:48,793
你说的那个警察的名字是Elmore Conklin
No, the police officer you refer to
is Elmore Conklin.

120
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:50,996
他在萨文丘警局
He's stationed in Savin Hill.

121
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:55,000
他收取Bobo这种非法帮派的保护费
He collects shakedowns from illegal establishments
such as Bobo's.

122
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:57,135
虽然我基本上不会拜访多切斯特
I rarely get over to Dorchester.

123
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:58,503
但是作为总警督
Still, as deputy superintendent

124
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:01,373
我对打击Bobo这种非法帮派还是很有兴趣的
I'd be happy to take a greater interest in Bobo.

125
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,511
我要去补个妆
I need to powder.

126
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,488
有这个必要吗
Was that necessary?

127
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,523
又不是我挑起来的争端 Joseph
I didn't start the fight, Joseph.

128
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:21,092
所以别怪我说了什么话把它结束
So, don't criticize me for how I finished it.

129
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,963
我当警察已经37年了
I've been a police officer for 37 years.

130
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,899
我学到的最重要的一件事 你知道是什么吗
If I've learned one thing above all, do you know
what it is?

131
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,368
又是关于什么伟大国家的老故事吗
This gonna be another yarn from the old country?

132
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,937
不是
No.

133
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:34,806
不管你做什么事 它们一定会报应在你身上
What you put out in the world will always
come back to you.

134
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,410
但它们总会出其不意
But never how you predict.

135
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,312
那当然 爸爸
I'm sure it doesn't.

136
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:43,315
因为无知而产生的自信
Unearned confidence of that about which
one is ignorant

137
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:45,183
总会太闪耀 让你盲目
always has the brightest glow.

138
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,386
我相信我已经赚得足够的自信了
I think I've earned enough.

139
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,590
她长得很美
She's quite easy on the eyes.

140
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,459
是的 没错
Yeah, she is.

141
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,463
当然除了外表 我不太明白你看中她哪一点
Apart from that, I fail to grasp
what you see in her.

142
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,332
你否定她 是因为她来自多切斯特吗
Because she's from Dorchester?

143
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:03,568
虽然这一点也没什么帮助 她父亲是个皮条客 
叔叔杀了至少两个我认识的人
That doesn't help. Her father's a pimp.
Her uncle killed two men.

144
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,571
但我可以忽视那些 Joseph 如果她——
But I could overlook all that, Joseph,
if she wasn't--

145
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:09,307
她从来没有假装过跟自己出身不符的人
she just doesn't pretend to be something she's not.

146
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,310
也许真正的她还没醒过来呢
Maybe she's just asleep.

147
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,880
谢谢你来看我
Thanks for stopping by.

148
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,949
也许今天晚上你应该跟他睡一个被窝
Maybe you should climb under
his covers tonight.

149
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,117
什么
What?

150
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,686
他贬低我 好像我是垃圾一样
He looks at me like I'm trash.

151
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,221
好像我们家人都不是人一样
We're not people.

152
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,490
我们只是多切斯特的Gould家
We're just the Goulds from Dorchester.

153
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:28,026
我们只配给你家织窗帘上的蕾丝
We tat the lace for your fucking curtains.

154
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,094
上帝啊 不要这么说
Jesus! You know what--

155
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:31,029
别他妈碰我
don't fucking touch me.

156
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:33,498
我整个人生都在目睹你父亲这样的人
My whole life, I got the high hat
and the icy mitt...

157
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,367
他们的高礼帽和冰冷的手
From people like your father.

158
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,802
我们并不比你们差
We're not less than you.

159
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,237
我没有这么说过
I never said you were.

160
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,805
但是他这么说了
Oh, well, he did.

161
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,841
管他呢
Fuck him, okay?

162
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:44,376
我爱你
I love you.

163
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,480
你以为爱情就这么容易吗
You think love's so easy.

164
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,916
我们可以让它就这么容易
It can be.

165
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,788
哦 上帝
Oh, god.

166
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,492
- 过来
- 我不要
- Come here.
- I don't want to.

167
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,861
- 别碰我
- 我很抱歉
- Leave me alone!
- I'm sorry.

168
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,263
对不起
I'm sorry.

169
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,666
- 我想离开
- 好的
- I want to go.
- Okay.

170
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:09,868
好的
Okay.

171
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,376
您能赏点小钱吗
Can you spare two bits?

172
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,413
太感谢您了
Thanks a lot.

173
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,350
Joe Coughlin 有人让我来的
Joe Coughlin. I got an invitation.

174
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,285
把胳膊抬起来
Put your arms up there.

175
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,820
我得先检查一下
I gotta check you.

176
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,692
进去吧
Go ahead.

177
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,002
Joseph吗
Joseph?

178
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,704
是的 Joe Coughlin 
Joe Coughlin. Yeah.

179
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:47,706
幸会
Pleasure.

180
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,810
你知道我是谁吗
Do you know who I am?

181
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:54,579
知道 所以我才应你的要求来到这里
I know enough to show up here when I'm asked.

182
00:11:56,982 --> 00:12:00,719
我的名字叫Maso Pescatore
My name is Maso Pescatore.

183
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,723
我帮派的地盘是波士顿北端 
I run the North End

184
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,659
还有南边佛罗里达州运来的私酒
and liquor coming up from Florida.

185
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,929
我呢——
I'm a man, uh,

186
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:15,066
我手上握着很多人的生死大权
with the power of other men's lives
in my hands.

187
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,835
但事实上
But the truth is, uh,

188
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,272
我只是个顽固的意大利老头而已
I'm just a simple wop from the old country.

189
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,675
现在 我唯一的仇敌
Today, my only true rival

190
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:25,710
就是Albert White
is Albert White.

191
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,881
解决掉他这个麻烦 我们就能
When that is no longer the case

192
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:34,719
停止这座城市里的斗争 杀戮和绝望
we can see an end to the fighting that has
plagued this town.

193
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:37,856
好吧
Well

194
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,892
我对你没有什么意见
I got no beef with you.

195
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:43,361
我只是不愿跟黑帮扯上关系
But I don't truck with gangsters.

196
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,029
哪怕是你这样风度卓群的大族长
Not even a sheik like you.

197
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,601
你犯下那么多的抢劫和偷窃
You do soup jobs and stickups

198
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,703
但却不认为自己是黑帮
but you're not a gangster.

199
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:53,838
- 那你觉得自己是什么
- 我也不知道
- What does that make you?
- I don't know.

200
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,573
大概是法外之徒吧
An outlaw, I guess.

201
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,642
我只是不想过黑帮的生活
I just don't want any part of that life.

202
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:00,578
发生在这个世界上的任何好事 或者坏事
How many things, good or bad,
come to us

203
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,815
有哪一件是我们想让它发生 就发生的呢
whether we ask for them or not?

204
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,383
比如说
For example,

205
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,886
我的一个手下看到你和一位年轻女士在一起
one of my men saw you with a young lady.

206
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:11,222
也许不叫“女士”更合适一点 一个情妇吧
Well, not so much a lady, but a <i> puttana</i> moll

207
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,324
她的金主是Albert White
whose daddy's Albert White.

208
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,933
你想要的已经不再重要了
So, it no longer matters so much what you want.

209
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,271
你已经身处其中
You're in this life

210
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:28,840
你面前只有两条路
and it can only end two ways.

211
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:29,974
第一
One,

212
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,610
你抢在Albert White之前解决他
you get to Albert and put an end to him.

213
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:33,678
第二
Two,

214
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,080
我把我所知道的告诉White
I tell Albert about the girl.

215
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,617
让他为了他的情人解决掉你
And he gets to you first.

216
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,888
我已经说过了
Like I said,

217
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,624
我不是黑帮
I ain't a gangster.

218
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:50,028
我这辈子已经杀够人了
And I done enough killing in this life.

219
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,897
你想告诉White你听到的风言风语 随便
You wanna tell your enemy some rumor you heard? 
Go ahead.

220
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,134
如果我杀掉Albert White
If I kill Albert White

221
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:59,204
他的位置会被另一个和他一样的人所取代
somebody's just gonna jump up
and take his place.

222
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:03,374
我却要与Pescatore帮派纠缠一生
And I'd be married to the Pescatore mob
for the rest of my life.

223
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:08,413
很早以前 我就不再亲吻大佬手上的戒指了
I stopped kissing rings a long time ago.

224
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,950
午安
Good afternoon.

225
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,459
<i>你觉得他已经告诉Albert了吗
Do you think he told Albert?</i>

226
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:24,128
如果告诉了 我早就死了
Nah. I'd be dead already.

227
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,530
上帝啊
Christ.

228
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,566
我们可以一起离开
We could leave.

229
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,603
去哪儿
Where would we go?

230
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:33,071
暖和的地方
Somewhere warm.

231
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,675
我哥哥Danny在加利福尼亚州
My brother Danny lives in California.

232
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,510
加利福尼亚州哪里
Where?

233
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,379
不知道 我们已经十年没说过话了
I don't know. I haven't talked to him
in 10 years.

234
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,482
他给我寄过明信片 说在当演员替身
He sent back a bunch of postcards saying
he was doing stunts

235
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,484
想要做编剧什么的
trying to be a writer.

236
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,219
上帝啊 我们可以去加利福尼亚州
God, I'd go to California.

237
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,955
不过提前跟你说 我可不懂什么正直的工作
I don't know much about honest work,
I gotta tell ya.

238
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:53,224
- 谁说我们要靠正直的工作活下去了
- 好吧
- Who said anything about honest work?
- Good.

239
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,760
我们可以为所欲为
No, we do what we wanna do.

240
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:57,896
想去哪就去哪
We'll go where we wanna go.

241
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,165
睡过整个白天
Sleep by day.

242
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,773
周六我在劳伦斯还有一票活儿
I got a job in Lawrence on Saturday.

243
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,241
之后我就自由了
And then I'll be free.

244
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,643
可以走了吗
Free to leave?

245
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:13,111
对 可以走了
Yeah. Free to leave.

246
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,049
我周六得去见那个--你知道是谁
I have to see you-know-who on Saturday.

247
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,018
- 让他去死吧
- 对 我也是这么想
- Fuck you-know-who.
- That's the idea.

248
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,154
别这样 你说怎么办 我也没得选
Oh, come on. What's the alternative?

249
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:26,658
你想让我被扔进查尔斯顿监狱吗
You want me to end up in the Charles?

250
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,460
周六我会跟他在Startler酒店见面
I'm supposed to meet him
at the Statler on Saturday.

251
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,932
他觉得让我看他和老婆亲热 是一件很兴奋的事
Turns him on to see me when his wife's on his arm.

252
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,202
在这之后他会到底特律去一周
After that, he's going to Detroit
for a week.

253
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:43,274
你结束之后 收拾一下 七点钟来酒店找我
Can you clean yourself up and get to the Statler
by 7:00?

254
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,744
我结束之后 收拾一下 七点钟来酒店找你
I think I can clean myself up and get
to the Statler by 7:00.

255
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,746
闭嘴
Shut up!

256
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:57,322
<i>劳伦斯的这一票足以赚够我和Emma私奔去加州的路费
The Lawrence bank job would net us enough</i>
<i> to get to California on.</i>

257
00:15:57,324 --> 00:16:00,158
<i>当时的我 就是在想这件事
It's true that's what I was thinking about.</i>

258
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,732
我们走
Let's go.

259
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,536
你在干什么
What are you doing?

260
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,307
警察 警察来了
Copper. Copper!

261
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:26,951
噢 小心 小心
Whoa, look out! Look out!

262
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,893
操
Fuck!

263
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:47,605
让开路
Get out of the way!

264
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:48,806
啊
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

265
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,745
哦 操 妈的
Oh, fuck! Shit!

266
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:59,751
快点 他妈的让开路 快滚
Move! Get out of the fucking way!
Get out of the way!

267
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:04,088
警察
Cop!

268
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,650
好了 快下车 走走走 快点
All right, get out. Let's go.
Go, go, go!

269
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,923
快上车
Get in the car! Go!

270
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,696
妈的
Shit!

271
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:01,599
<i>我走了半英里 偷到一辆车往北雷丁开去
I walked half a mile, stole a car in North Reading</i>

272
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:04,602
<i>又换了一辆在萨默维尔发现的道奇汽车
and replaced it with a Dodge
I found in Somerville.</i>

273
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:08,806
<i>我回到童年的老房子里  考虑着自己接下来的选项
I came back to my childhood home and</i>
<i>considered my options.</i>

274
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,347
<i>最新的报纸头条上 到处都是刚刚发生的一切
The story was in all the late editions.</i>

275
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,282
<i>三名死去的警察中有一名州警
The third dead cop was a trooper</i>

276
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:21,485
<i>在州际森林附近追上了逃逸车辆
who pulled someone over near the state forest.</i>

277
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,957
<i>那一定是Dion了 
Had to be Dion.</i>

278
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,877
继续往前走 这边有一台运货电梯
Keep going. There's a service elevator
up here.

279
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:54,312
我真不敢相信你真的来了
I can't believe you came!

280
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,314
- 我不来还能去哪儿呢
- 逃命啊
- What was I gonna do?
- Run.

281
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,516
- 逃到哪儿去
- 我不知道 出了这种事 人们都会这么做的
- Where?
- I don't know. It's what people do.

282
00:21:58,518 --> 00:21:59,884
可我不会这么做
It's not what I do.

283
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:06,390
来吧
Come on.

284
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:09,860
妈的 该死
Shit! Shit! Shit!

285
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:25,609
你哭什么
Why are you crying?

286
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:28,679
因为我爱你
Because I love you.

287
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,648
那就笑一笑啊
Then smile.

288
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,516
我做不到
I can't.

289
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:34,785
不
No.

290
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,240
你如果死了
I'm sure as you die

291
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:32,009
肯定会告诉自己 你是因爱殉情
you'll tell yourself you did it for love.

292
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,879
不是的
No.

293
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:37,815
你只是对你自己所做的事心怀愧疚
You feel guilty about what you do

294
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:42,486
你这一生都在等人来惩罚你的罪恶
so you spend your life hoping someone will
punish you for your sins.

295
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:44,088
所以
Well,

296
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,558
我就来了
here I am.

297
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,692
Joe 真对不起
Joe, I'm so sorry.

298
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:51,896
她真抱歉
She's sorry.

299
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:53,931
我们都他妈觉得很抱歉呢
We're all fucking sorry.

300
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,099
把她带走吧
Take her out of here.

301
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,300
你答应我 你不会杀了他的
You said you wouldn't kill him.

302
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:57,735
Albert 我们说好了的
Albert, that was the deal.

303
00:23:57,737 --> 00:24:00,104
- 跟你没关系了
- Albert 我不会带他--
- Don't worry.
- I would never have brought him here--

304
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:08,112
你觉得我会当众被你这样一个妓女侮辱吗
You think I'm going to be humiliated
by a whore?

305
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,814
有人告诉我
Someone comes to me

306
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:14,185
我的婊子在外面 和别的男人瞎搞
says some arsehole is putting horns
on my fucking head.

307
00:24:14,187 --> 00:24:18,522
我没他妈把你的奶子切下来 再把你扔到垃圾堆里
算你幸运了
You're lucky I didn't cut your tits off and throw
you in the fucking dump.

308
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:24,328
- Donnie 带她上车去吧
- 不
- Take her to the car, Donnie.
- No!

309
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,897
Joe 对不起
Joe, I'm sorry!

310
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:28,499
Albert 不要杀她
Albert, don't kill her.

311
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:30,901
你还是担心接下来我要怎么收拾你吧
You should be more worried about what
I'm going to do to you.

312
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:32,570
Albert 不要杀她
Albert, don't kill her.

313
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:34,672
你何必关心她呢 她刚刚出卖了你
Fuck do you care? She just sold you
down the river.

314
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:36,073
求你
Please.

315
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:39,743
我对她说了谎
I wasn't honest.

316
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:42,646
我答应她如果她带你来见我
我就不会杀了你
I said if she delivered you to us,
I wouldn't kill you.

317
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,483
但我们都心知肚明 我必须要杀了你 Joe
But we both know I have to kill you,
don't we, Joe?

318
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:47,518
然后
And then,

319
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,321
我还要把她也杀掉
I'm going to kill her, too.

320
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,199
放开他
Leave him.

321
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:03,501
离开这里
Let's get out of here.

322
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,381
所以你现在杀警察了 对吗 Joseph
So you're a cop killer now, Joseph?

323
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:20,050
我没有杀人
I didn't kill anybody.

324
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:23,587
看起来 你的朋友准备带你走一趟死亡之旅
Looks like your friends were about to take you
on the dead man's drive.

325
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:27,525
爸爸 他们会杀了她的
Dad, they're gonna kill her.

326
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:30,494
我们不会杀你
Well, we won't kill you, Joseph.

327
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:32,997
只是我的同事想跟你聊聊
But some of my coworkers would like a word.

328
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:34,532
听着 求求你
Listen, please.

329
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:36,133
爸爸
Dad!

330
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:38,769
他们会杀了她了
They're gonna kill her.

331
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:41,505
她在Donnie Gishler的车上--
She's in the car with Donnie gishler.

332
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,623
我不知道这孩子的头是什么做的 
反正不可能是普通的骨头
I don't know what his skull's made of,
but it isn't bone.

333
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,225
昏迷两周
In a coma two weeks.

334
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:04,662
没有颅内出血 没有记忆遗失 也没有语言障碍 
No cranial bleeding. No loss of memory
or speech disability.

335
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:06,964
只是断了鼻梁和一半的肋骨
His nose and half his ribs are broken.

336
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:10,434
不过要到他不再排带血的小便 还得等一阵
进去吧
It'll be a long time before he doesn't see any blood
in the bowl. Go on in.

337
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,708
爸爸 她在哪儿
Dad, where is she?

338
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:20,044
找到她了吗
Did they find her?

339
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:22,546
我们跟踪了Donnie Gishler和她的车子
We followed her and Donnie Gishler.

340
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:26,784
他们在晚间九点二十分左右 掉进了海里
His car went off the road and into the ocean at 9:20.

341
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:30,988
贝弗利警局的一个警察潜水去找尸体
An officer from Beverly dove in looking for them.

342
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:34,191
什么也没找到 还因为体温过低住院一周
Ended up in the hospital for a week with hypothermia.

343
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:38,629
她是Albert White的情人
She was Albert white's girl.

344
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:40,264
她背叛了你
She betrayed you.

345
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,300
没错
She did.

346
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,336
然后呢
And?

347
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:47,671
我为她痴迷
I'm crazy about her.

348
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:49,773
痴迷并不是爱情
Crazy isn't love.

349
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:53,210
你自己十八年的婚姻都不是爱情
I saw your marriage for 18 years. It wasn't love.

350
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:55,879
对
No.

351
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,482
我知道那不是爱情
No, it wasn't.

352
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,552
无论如何 她已经死了
Either way, she's gone.

353
00:27:01,554 --> 00:27:04,355
像你妈妈一样 上帝让她安息吧
She's as dead as your mother. God rest her.

354
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:11,695
他们在美加国境线十英里的圣阿尔邦抓住了Paulo
They caught up with Paulo in St. Albans about
10 miles from the border.

355
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:14,665
一队警察对他实施了追捕
A number of officers gave chase.

356
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:18,002
参加追捕的警察用14颗子弹结束了他的生命
He was struck by at least 14 rounds.

357
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:19,903
对于一个杀警察的凶手 还不够解气
Low for a cop killer.

358
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,107
Dion呢
What about Dion?

359
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:25,576
他可能已经逃过国境线了
It's possible he made the border.

360
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:46,864
你本应该是改进我和你母亲关系 拉进我们之间距离的幼子
You were the child that was supposed to fix the distance
between me and your mother.

361
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:48,899
你知道这一点吗
Were you aware of that?

362
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,437
我知道你和母亲之间有距离
I was aware of the distance.

363
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:57,274
人与人之间的关系不会改进的
People don't fix each other.

364
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:02,680
他们永远都不会为彼此做出改变
And they never become anything
but what they've always been.

365
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:06,417
我们能活在这个世界上 是因为运气
All we get sometimes is a little luck.

366
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:12,890
不要把你的运气浪费在对已经死去的女人的渴望上
Don't waste yours pining for a dead girl.

367
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:14,792
你自己决定自己的运气
You make your own luck.

368
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:16,360
有时是这样
Sometimes.

369
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:18,629
有时候运气能决定你的命运
Sometimes it makes you.

370
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:29,039
如果他认罪的话 
If he pleads guilty

371
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,675
我能让他免于死刑 
I can take the death penalty off the table.

372
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:41,285
三年牢狱 二十年缓刑
Three years served, 20 probation.

373
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:43,220
三年怎么可能
Three years?

374
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,222
这是三个警察的命案啊
There are three dead police officers.

375
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,824
又不是他杀的人
And he didn't kill them.

376
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:53,897
虽然他是总警监的儿子
He may be the son of a deputy superintendent

377
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,432
但是 他一定
but he will long know the inside

378
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:57,267
要去查尔斯顿监狱服刑的
of the Charlestown prison, I promise you.

379
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:58,569
我只是个小督查
Chief inspector.

380
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:01,338
我昨天被贬职了
I was demoted yesterday.

381
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,476
那该说的我也不用说了 你也别做梦了
Then we can leave unsaid the notion I was going
to dispel for you.

382
00:29:05,478 --> 00:29:07,411
我没有做梦
I have no illusions.

383
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,580
我只不过是个实际的人
I'm a practical man.

384
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:15,152
照片上是后湾区的排房
The photograph is of a door
to a row house in back bay

385
00:29:15,154 --> 00:29:19,289
是你和那个墨西哥年轻男孩约会的地方
where you have been keeping time with a young man
of Mexican descent.

386
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:22,526
如果你胆敢更改你们的私通的地点
If you move the location of your liaisons

387
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:24,528
我一小时内就会知道
I will know within the hour.

388
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,705
我会想想办法
Let me see what I can do.

389
00:29:34,707 --> 00:29:37,541
我不管你想什么办法
Seeing what you can do is of little interest to me.

390
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:54,024
<i>我被法庭宣判持械抢劫罪名成立
I pled guilty to abetting armed robbery...</i>

391
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:57,861
<i>将在查尔斯顿监狱服刑三年零四个月
And was given three years and four months</i>
<i>in the Charlestown prison.</i>

392
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:32,796
<i>如果父亲能再坚持两周的生命
If my father had lived two more weeks</i>

393
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:36,600
<i>我就能来得及出狱跟他道别
I could have said goodbye.</i>

394
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:26,783
<i>我拥有这注定的命运
I got one guaranteed life</i>

395
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:29,987
<i>我决定要好好过下去
and I was gonna live it.</i>

396
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,392
<i>我要利用Maso和他与Albert的恩怨
I would use Maso and his hatred for Albert</i>

397
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,094
<i>作为开始的棋子
to get me started.</i>

398
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,063
事情变成这样 也挺有趣的
Funny how things change.

399
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:44,001
之前你在我面前侃侃而谈 说自己不做黑帮
What happened to all the talk
about not being a gangster?

400
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:47,037
而现在你又来找我 要求工作的机会
Now you come to me looking for a job.

401
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,206
我什么都没有了
I got nothing left.

402
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:51,808
我不愿做黑帮
I don't wanna be a gangster.

403
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:54,745
但是如果这个帮派能帮我扳倒Albert White
我愿意为其效力
But I'll work for one if I can get to Albert White.

404
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:56,747
从我在监狱听说的来看
From what I heard in prison

405
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:58,882
你还是想要Albert死的
you're still the man to see about that.

406
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:02,719
我们已经把他逐出了波士顿 你可能也听说了
We ran Albert White out of Boston, like you heard.

407
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:07,224
现在他正在佛罗里达州中部经营私酒生意
Now, he's making a run to our rum operation
in central Florida.

408
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:08,892
他想掌控坦帕市
He wants Tampa.

409
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:11,295
确实 我很需要人
It's true, I could use someone

410
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:14,031
需要一个想让他不再死灰复燃的手下
who is committed to putting an end to Mr. white.

411
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:16,033
我就是你要找的人
Then you've found your man right here.

412
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:17,901
你要永远把Pescatore家族放在第一
Your duty would always have to be

413
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:21,338
自己的事放在其次
to the Pescatore family first and yourself second.

414
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,873
你能接受吗
You live with that?

415
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:24,274
可以
Sounds fair.

416
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,576
我需要我的老帮手 Dion Bartolo
I just need one guy, Dion Bartolo
from my old crew

417
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:28,145
帮忙将一切打理妥当
to help me go down there and set up.

418
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:31,014
你能有个信得过的人 很不错
It's good to have someone you can trust.

419
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,720
佛罗里达的天气热得很
It's hot down there.

420
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:38,088
没关系 我不怕热
I don't mind hot.

421
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,390
你可从没经历过那种炎热
You ain't never felt hot like this hot.

422
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:43,961
我刚从查尔斯顿监狱出来 暖和一点挺好
I spent some winters in Charlestown.
I could use a change.

423
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:48,332
你到了坦帕市 要把我们的毒品生意建立起来
And get the narcotics running.
Starting in Tampa.

424
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:50,000
但是Frank Ormino现在管理着坦帕
Frank Ormino runs Tampa.

425
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:52,502
他决定不想面对这种令人头痛的局面了
He's gonna decide he doesn't need the headache.

426
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:54,104
什么时候决定的
When's he gonna decide that?

427
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:56,373
你到坦帕后十分钟 他就会决定了
10 minutes after you get there.

428
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,008
我明白了
I see.

429
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,410
- 如果我掌管了坦帕市 我们就是合作伙伴了吗
- 不
- Is that gonna make me and you equal partners?
- No.

430
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:02,446
Frank Ormino就是你同等的合作伙伴啊
Frank Ormino's an equal partner.

431
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:05,449
你看他又落得什么结果呢
But look what's gonna happen to him.

432
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:08,051
估计我是廉价劳动力吧
I guess I work cheap.

433
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:10,754
你不介意帮派里有爱尔兰人吗
Can you tolerate an Irishman in your crew?

434
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:13,924
在美国 我还见过更糟的呢
This is America. I've lived with worse.

435
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:34,177
<i>我意识到 打破规则是不够的
I realized it's not enough</i>
<i>to break the rules.</i>

436
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:37,247
<i>你需要足够强大 来自己立定规则
You have to be strong enough to make your own.</i>

437
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:51,828
嗨
Hi!

438
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,608
Joseph 啊
Joseph! Ah!

439
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:08,445
你好吗
How you doing?

440
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:09,946
- 看看你啊
- 看看你
- Look at you.
- Look at you!

441
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:12,049
关于你爸的事 很遗憾
Hey, sorry about your father.

442
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:13,650
你哥也是
Yeah, sorry about your brother.

443
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:15,419
谢谢 谢谢
Thank you. Hey, thank you.

444
00:34:15,421 --> 00:34:18,255
听着 当左撇子Downer在蒙特利尔找到我
Listen, when lefty Downer found me in Montreal

445
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:20,991
跟我说Pescatore让我跟他们干的时候
and told me the Pescatores wanted me to
come work for them

446
00:34:20,993 --> 00:34:23,560
我以为他们要骗我还是咋的
I thought it was a straight bamboozle.

447
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,228
然后我又一想
Then I thought

448
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,864
这世上能把Pescatore这个魔鬼打动的人
一定是我的老搭档你啦
if anyone could charm the devil,
it's my old partner.

449
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:29,900
- 看哦 快看这车
- 哇 牛逼 
- Look at this.
- Holy shit!

450
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:32,035
快看看
Would you look at this?

451
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:33,403
来 你先上
Here. After you.

452
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,704
别这么说啊
Get the fuck out of here.

453
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:37,874
我现在是你的马仔了 Joe Coughlin老板
I work for you now. Boss Joe coughlin.

454
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:40,977
去摸摸座位底下 有个好朋友等着你呢
Reach under the seat and you'll find a friend.

455
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:50,554
欢迎来到依伯城
这里是坦帕的有色人种聚居区
Welcome to Ybor, the Harlem of Tampa.

456
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:52,589
这座城市是建立在雪茄厂上的
Cigars built this place.

457
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,224
虽然现在你在空气中闻到的味道
What you're smelling now

458
00:34:54,226 --> 00:34:57,160
有可能是蛋糕 也有可能是馅饼味
is probably bolos or empanadas.

459
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:59,262
坦帕市的其他地方都不和我们玩的
The rest of Tampa leaves Ybor alone.

460
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:02,299
在他们看来 我们只是一群
来自意大利和西班牙的脏鬼
As far as they're concerned,we're a bunch
of dirty spics and wops

461
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:03,967
只要不惹他们
and we can fuck off and
do what we need to do

462
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:05,435
他们才懒得理我们干嘛
as long as we leave them alone.

463
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,604
你会以为 大家都相安无事
You'd think we all get along

464
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,340
不过 实际上并没有这么平静
but it don't work out that way.

465
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:13,577
意大利人和古巴人都是自己玩自己的
The Italians and the Cubans
keep to themselves.

466
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:15,612
但是古巴人不喜欢西班牙人
But the Cubans, they hate the spaniards

467
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,315
而西班牙人又认为古巴人是一群自大和忘恩负义的黑鬼 
and the spaniards look at all Cubans
like they're uppity coons

468
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:21,551
美国在一八九八年解放他们之后
尾巴都翘到天上去了
who forgot their place since America
freed them in '98.

469
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:25,055
不过古巴人和西班牙人都讨厌波多黎各人
The Cubans and the Spanish, they look down
on the puerto ricans

470
00:35:25,057 --> 00:35:27,991
这里所有的人 每一个人都鄙视多米尼加人
and everyone, I mean everyone,
shits on the Dominicans.

471
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:30,594
意大利人只对白人毕恭毕敬
The Italians only respect you
if you came off the boat.

472
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:32,429
你们好 女士们
How you doing, ladies?

473
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:35,265
而美国白人觉得自己放个屁都有人关心
And the white people think anyone gives a shit
what they think.

474
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:37,734
你真厉害哟
You're a fucking piece of work.

475
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,452
这里是坦帕港口
Port of Tampa.

476
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,493
是谁呀
Who is it?

477
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:04,995
壁炉
Fireplace.

478
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:17,374
谢谢 J.T. 干得不错
Thanks, J.T. Good work.

479
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:21,711
整个城市有这样整整一套地下通道网络
There's a whole network of tunnels like this
under the city.

480
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:25,715
- 这个地下仓库是谁的
- 曾经是Frank Ormino的
- Who owns this warehouse?
- Frank Ormino did.

481
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:27,317
曾经是什么意思
What do you mean Ormino "did"?

482
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:29,819
Ormino几天前被打成筛子了
Ormino sprung a few leaks the other day.

483
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,024
这么快
That was quick.

484
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:35,625
看这边
Look at this over here.

485
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:37,294
花钱能买到的最好的设备
Best money can buy!

486
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:40,931
这东西得看好了 温度保持在华氏一百八十六度
You gotta keep it at 186 fahrenheit.

487
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:43,700
这就对了 这宝贝从不骗人
Yeah, these babies never lie.

488
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:47,137
不能让买酒的人酒精中毒死了啊
Like to keep people from dying when they
drink your hooch.

489
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:48,772
虽然我只会在监狱便池里酿酒
We made a lot of toilet booze in prison.

490
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:51,208
但我也知道要酿酒 你还缺两样东西吧
Looks to me like you're missing
two key ingredients.

491
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,777
- 是什么
- 工人 糖浆
- Which are?
- People and molasses.

492
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:55,111
对 我们有麻烦了
Yeah, we got a problem.

493
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:57,047
- 怎么了
- 是我们的供应商
- What?
- Our distributor.

494
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:59,115
他没有拿到货
He's been coming up empty.

495
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:00,083
怎么回事
What is it?

496
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:01,284
运货出了沉船事故
Boats have been sinking.

497
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:03,820
- 这家伙叫什么
- Gary L. Smith
- What's his name?
- Gary L. Smith

498
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,822
- Gary Ellsmith吗
- 不对
- Gary Ellsmith.
- No.

499
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:08,959
是Gary L. Smith 中间是缩写的大写字母
Gary L. Smith. It's a middle initial.

500
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:11,695
我也不知道为什么 他喜欢别人这么叫他
南方人的习惯
I don't know. He wants people to use it.
It's a Southern thing.

501
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:13,463
啊 难道不是混蛋的习惯吗
Not just an asshole thing?

502
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:15,966
也是
Both.

503
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,470
谢谢你 Roe小姐
Thank you, Miss Roe.

504
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:22,639
你们一定是Maso新的手下吧
You must be Maso's new find.

505
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:25,242
差不多吧 算是
I guess something like that.

506
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:27,244
- 你们好吗
- 很好
- How you doing? 
- All right.

507
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:30,780
那么 你们来这里有什么事吗
So what brings you by?

508
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:33,383
我来是接管Frank Ormino的后事
I've been asked to take over
Frank Ormino's affairs.

509
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:35,552
我希望你们无需久留
I hope that's not permanent.

510
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:38,888
- 不好意思 我没有恶意
- 没什么 怎么了
- No offense.
- None taken. Why is that?

511
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,625
人们乐意和熟识的人做生意
Folks like dealing with who they know.

512
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:43,126
而不是像你们这样的生面孔
And nobody knows you.

513
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:46,196
哦 我明白了 那你说我们该跟谁做生意呢
I see. Well, uh, who would you suggest?

514
00:37:46,198 --> 00:37:48,665
我没有什么野心
I have no ambitions for it

515
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:52,535
不过我可以考虑 跟你们做生意试试看
but to keep continuity,I might consider
doing it for a term.

516
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:55,672
之前三次我们找你运货 船都沉了
We're mostly concerned with why the last three
supply runs were hit.

517
00:37:55,674 --> 00:37:57,007
是古巴人干的
That's the Cubans.

518
00:37:57,009 --> 00:37:58,608
那再找一个新的供货商不就得了
Why don't you justgo to a new supplier?

519
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,543
- 没那么简单
- 为什么
- Not that simple.
- Why not?

520
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,082
因为这里所有供货商都要向Suarez家族进贡的
Because they're all paying tribute to
the Suarez family.

521
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:08,151
就是那个第七大街上开俱乐部的古巴人吗
That's the Cubans who own that club
down on 7th, right?

522
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:09,886
我们也会找他谈的
We're gonna need to talk to them, too.

523
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:13,323
呃
Uh,

524
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:17,160
你可能不知道 在这里我们是怎么办事的
I'm afraid you don't understand how
things are done here.

525
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:19,763
我直接和Suarez先生
I deal with Mr. Suarez

526
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:21,197
还有他的姐姐交易
and his sister.

527
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:29,639
好吧 明天晚上九点我们在他的俱乐部见面
Okay, I'm sure we can arrange a table for tomorrow
night about 9:00.

528
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:30,774
好极了
Great.

529
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:32,075
现在 Gary L. 你实话告诉我
Now, Gary L., tell me this.

530
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:33,910
你是直接为Albert White工作的吗
Do you work directly for Albert White?

531
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:36,846
又或者还有我们不知道的其他中间人
Or is there some intermediary I should
know about, as well?

532
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:39,316
- 什么
- 我们给瓶子做了标记
- What?
- We marked your bottles.

533
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:42,452
- 你们什么
- 所有酿的酒 我们都有标记
- You what?
- If you distilled it, we marked it.

534
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:45,388
所有那些应该在海运中丢失的私酒
And all these runs that were supposedly
lost at sea

535
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:48,858
全丢到Albert White的酒吧里去了
somehow made their way
into Albert White's speakeasies.

536
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,994
这你怎么解释
Can you explain that?

537
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:53,129
我不明白你什么意思
No. I don't understand.

538
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:55,465
我们来的时候 Dion载我经过了你家
Dion drove me by your house on
the way over here.

539
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:57,100
你家很漂亮嘛
You got a lovely place.

540
00:38:57,102 --> 00:38:58,601
不过你得把这漂亮的家好好打包
You're gonna have to pack up all that shit

541
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:00,737
哪儿凉快滚哪儿去吧
and send it wherever it is you're going.

542
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:02,539
去哪儿
Where am I going?

543
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:03,940
你操过她吗
Are you fucking her?

544
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:05,675
什么 操谁啊
What? Who?

545
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,377
- 刚刚那位Roe小姐
- 你说什么
- Miss Roe.
- What?

546
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:09,145
- 肯定操过
- 毫无疑问了
- He's fucking her.
- Without question.

547
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:11,081
- 一定是操过了
- 拜托
- Definitely fucking her.
- Oh, come on.

548
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:13,216
下午在办公室细细品味她 早晨又--
Afternoon taste of Miss Roe--

549
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,554
算了 我不在乎你操谁
whatever. I don't care who you fuck.

550
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:18,955
这有几张车票
Here's some tickets.

551
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:21,091
晚上11点钟的车票
This is the 11:00 <i>seaboard</i> tonight.

552
00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:24,561
我不管你带着谁走 但今天晚上你得赶上这趟火车
I don't care who you take with you, but you gotta
be on that train.

553
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:29,532
等一下 先生们
Wait a minute, gentlemen.

554
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:31,668
等等 咱们讲讲道理吧
Come on a second here. We could go through
the whole thing.

555
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,703
我可以直接放到你 让你的脑袋像个保龄球一样
在地上滚来滚去
I can bounce your head off the floor like
a fucking bowling ball.

556
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,372
但我们还是把事情搞得简单点
But let's just make it easy.

557
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:38,508
不然你自己登上那列火车 Gary L.
Put yourself on that train, Gary L.

558
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,510
要不然你就等着我们把你扔在铁轨上
Or we're gonna have to put you under it.

559
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:42,512
听着 我们--能不能好好--
Listen, I think... Could we...

560
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:45,115
拜托你们了 先生--
Now, come on, fellas. Gentlemen, can we...

561
00:39:45,117 --> 00:39:47,016
大伙能不能坐下来谈谈--
Let's just sit and visit with each other.

562
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:50,387
Coughlin先生
Mr. Coughlin.

562
00:39:52,033 --> 00:39:56,043
Francis Ormino中枪身亡
警察正在寻找目击证人

563
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,463
Roe小姐
Miss Roe!

564
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:02,599
你什么时候标记的瓶子
When did you mark the bottles?

565
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,968
你他妈说啥呢
Fuck you talking about?

566
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,036
自从我来了这里 你和我寸步不离
You've been with me every second
since I've been here.

567
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:08,538
你哪只眼见我标记瓶子了
See me mark any bottles?

568
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,074
对啊 所以我才知道你在里面说的都是胡话
No! That's how come I knew it was bullshit.

569
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,135
本人Dion Bartolo
Dion Bartolo.

570
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:41,638
我知道 这边请 Esteban先生已经等候多时了
Yes, of course. This way, please.
Mr. Esteban is waiting.

571
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,925
Suarez先生 幸会了
Mr. Suarez, nice to see you.

572
00:41:01,927 --> 00:41:04,461
我给您介绍一下 这是Joe Coughlin
Let me introduce you to Joe Coughlin.

573
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:06,963
- 很高兴见到您 先生
- 我也是
- It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Pleasure.

574
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,599
来喝一杯吧
Have a drink.

575
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,602
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

576
00:41:12,604 --> 00:41:16,873
我从来就不认同古老的西班牙统治者所说的 私酒要越淡越好
I never agreed with the Spanish that the
lighter rums were superior.

577
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:18,708
但是我们古巴人还是照做了
Of course, we Cubans
went along

578
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,944
因为 古巴人认为无论什么都是越淡越好
because of our obsession that lighter is
greater in all things.

579
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,380
Dion Joesph  这是我的姐姐 Graciela
Dion, Joseph, my sister, Graciela.

580
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:26,683
- 很高兴见到你
- 我们已经见过了
- Nice to meet you.
- We've met.

581
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:28,852
抱歉是我记错了 当然 我们已经见过面了
My mistake. Of course, we have met.

582
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:30,220
是的
Yes, we have.

583
00:41:30,222 --> 00:41:31,454
你好吗
How you doing?

584
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:34,090
你好 很高兴见到你
Hi. How are you? Nice to meet you.

585
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,993
上帝 这酒真不错
God, this rum is incredible.

586
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,229
如果能卖到北边去 那就太好了
Be nice if we could sell it up north.

587
00:41:39,231 --> 00:41:41,231
等你们的国家把你们当成年人 让你们喝酒了再说吧
When your country treats you like adults.

588
00:41:41,233 --> 00:41:43,566
不急 如果那样 我们这种人会失业的
No hurry. We'd be out of a job.

589
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,369
照片都是Esteban拍的
Esteban took those.

590
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:49,105
- 都是一些迈阿密的工人
- 拍得真棒
- The working people of Miami.
- Very good.

591
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:50,440
只是爱好而已
It is a hobby.

592
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:52,609
有空的话我可以给你拍肖像 Coughlin先生
Perhaps I photograph you some day, Mr. Coughlin.

593
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:55,044
算了 我这种人 还是照片越少越好
I don't know about that.
Fewer pictures out there of me, the better.

594
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:57,814
我同意印第安人说的
I'm with the Indians on that one.

595
00:41:59,518 --> 00:42:01,818
说到摄魂——
Speaking of captured souls

596
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,954
我听说
I've been told

597
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:07,423
Gary L. Smith先生昨天晚上带着妻子登火车走了
that Mr. Gary L. Smith was seen boarding
the seaboard limited

598
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:08,791
带着妻子登火车走了
with his wife in one Pullman

599
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:11,261
还有他的所有家当
and he had that <i> puta maestra</i> in the other.

600
00:42:11,263 --> 00:42:12,729
这不好说
Oh, you never know.

601
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:15,398
有的时候换个环境对人很有好处的
Sometimes a change of scenery can do a man good.

602
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,400
所以你才来到依伯吗
Is that why you're here in Ybor?

603
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:19,135
想要换个环境吗
Little change of scenery?

604
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:22,005
我来依伯是为了酿制和贩卖私酒
I'm here in Ybor to distill and
distribute the demon rum.

605
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:25,909
但是现在因为你们不太正常的运货日程计划 
我们有了点麻烦
A task which is made more difficult by your
erratic import schedules.

606
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:27,310
我们又不能左右海洋
We don't control the tides.

607
00:42:27,312 --> 00:42:29,345
到迈阿密的船可是都不受海洋的影响呢
Tides have been fine from here to Miami.

608
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:31,347
迈阿密的事情我们可不知道
We know nothing of the boats to Miami.

609
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:34,684
Famosa先生知道 他告诉我们说
夏天这一带海域都是风平浪静
Senor Famosa assures me the tides have
been calm all summer.

610
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:40,356
既然你提到了Famosa先生的名字
And you say Senor Famosa's name

611
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:42,292
我们担心你会抢占我们的运输路线
so we worry you may overtake our supply routes.

612
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,193
不需要
No.

613
00:42:44,195 --> 00:42:46,696
不需要 我提到他的名字只是想要跟你们表明
I use Senor Famosa's name to reassure you

614
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:49,232
从今往后 你们和我可以直接交易
that from now on, you can work directly with me

615
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:51,434
甚至可以提高价钱
and that you can charge me
a higher price.

616
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:53,970
- 我们能得到什么回报呢
- 你们可以得到
- What do we get in return?
- You get access

617
00:42:53,972 --> 00:42:57,006
Ormino手下的警察和法官的保护 现在一切由我们控制
to Ormino's cops and judges, which we now control.

618
00:42:57,008 --> 00:43:00,443
其中大多数的人也不会跟你们做交易
因为你们是古巴人
And most of whom wouldn't  do business with you otherwise
because you're Cuban.

619
00:43:00,445 --> 00:43:02,645
你是想要我们糖浆的独家供货吗
And you would want exclusive
access to our molasses?

620
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:05,481
不需要 只要你切断Albert White的供货就可以了
Nope. You just can't sell to the White operation.

621
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:08,251
Albert White是一名让我们盈利的客户
Albert White is a paying customer.

622
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:10,219
他一直没给我们惹过麻烦
We've never had a problem with him.

623
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:12,121
我认识Albert White
I know Albert White.

624
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:13,756
我以为你们只愿意跟把你们当人看
I thought you might like to deal with someone

625
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,725
的客户做生意呢
who treated you like a human being.

626
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:18,194
这会引起流血事件吗
It is possible this will bring bloodshed.

627
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:21,331
当然会
This will definitely bring bloodshed.

628
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,202
我们提出的可是非常有利的条件
These are very favorable terms.

629
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,275
我们要只要Albert White
Albert White is what we get.

630
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:36,479
<i>地方警长要见我们
The local sheriff wanted to see us.</i>

631
00:43:36,481 --> 00:43:38,448
<i>这是种心照不宣的规矩
Apparently, it was a custom down there</i>

632
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:41,351
<i>在我们进行非法活动前
最好先跟他谈谈怎么违法比较好一些
to talk about how you were gonna break</i>
<i>the law before you did it.</i>

633
00:43:41,353 --> 00:43:43,252
警长人怎么样？
What kind of guy is the chief?

634
00:43:43,254 --> 00:43:45,755
他是个条子 所以挺混蛋的
He's a copper, so he's an asshole.

635
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:48,358
除了这点 其他还可以吧
Beyond that, he's okay.

636
00:43:52,897 --> 00:43:55,298
你干嘛 别乱动人家东西
What are you doing? Don't fuck with
the guy's stuff.

637
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:59,502
别让警长进门来看见个小混混动他文件
The sheriff's gonna come in to find some dago going
through his fucking papers.

638
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,907
看 Figgis警长长这样
Hey, this is Figgis right here.

639
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:12,515
请坐
Please, sit down.

640
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:23,526
我不想侮辱你们的智商
I won't insult you

641
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:26,929
所以就不问你们具体做什么生意了
by asking the nature of your business

642
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:30,667
你们也别撒谎来侮辱我的智商
so you won't have to insult me by lying.

643
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,469
可以吗
That fair?

644
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:36,039
我觉得可以
Sounds fair to me.

645
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:39,609
听说你是警监的儿子
It true you're a police captain's son?

646
00:44:39,611 --> 00:44:41,077
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

647
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:42,879
你在海外服过兵役吗
You serve overseas?

648
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:44,280
是的 在法国
France.

649
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:47,016
向军队致敬
Tell it to the marines.

650
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,351
好的
Yes, sir.

651
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:50,286
军队里面给我们讲过这个
They told it to us.

652
00:44:50,288 --> 00:44:54,190
我曾经也是一名士兵 然后又做了执法官
I was a soldier and then a U.S. marshal.

653
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:57,026
在我的人生中 我只杀过七个人
I've killed seven men in my lifetime.

654
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:58,327
实话说
Truth be told

655
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:01,431
直到今天 我还被关于他们的噩梦侵扰
their faces haunt me most nights.

656
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:12,041
把你们的生意范围控制在第二大街以北
You keep your business north of 2nd,

657
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,243
第二十七大街以南
south of 27th

658
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:17,447
内布拉斯加以东
and east of Nebraska,

659
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:20,950
你我之间就没什么分歧了
you and I will have little
in the way of discord.

660
00:45:20,952 --> 00:45:22,585
好的
Sounds good.

661
00:45:22,587 --> 00:45:25,988
我们生活在一个堕落的世界
I know we live in a fallen world,

662
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:28,658
虽然我呼吸着腐败的空气
but just because I breathe corrupt air

663
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,929
跟腐败的人们摩肩接踵
and rub elbows with corrupt men

664
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:37,066
但不要以为我也会随之变得腐败
never make the mistake of thinking

665
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,335
永远都不要幻想我会被你们腐蚀
that I am corruptible.

666
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,638
我不会犯这种错误的
I won't make that mistake.

667
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,475
好的
Right.

668
00:45:45,477 --> 00:45:48,478
哦 抱歉 父亲 我以为只有你一个人的
Oh, dear, I'm sorry. Thought you were alone.

669
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,481
Loretta 没关系 这些先生正要走呢
That's all right, Loretta.
These gentlemen were just leaving.

670
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,684
亲爱的 你的礼仪呢
Honey, your manners.

671
00:45:54,686 --> 00:45:55,952
哦 对 父亲
Oh, yes, father.

672
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:00,022
我是Loretta Figgis
Miss Loretta Figgis.

673
00:46:00,024 --> 00:46:02,391
幸会 我是Joe Coughlin
Pleased to meet you, miss.
I'm Joe Coughlin.

674
00:46:02,393 --> 00:46:03,926
我是Dion Bartolo
Dion Bartolo.

675
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:07,964
今天Loretta要坐火车踏上一段长长的旅程了
Loretta is taking the train
on a long journey today.

676
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:09,632
是要走了吗
It's going around.

677
00:46:09,634 --> 00:46:11,801
- 她要去加利福亚州了
- 是吗
- California.
- Is that right?

678
00:46:11,803 --> 00:46:14,437
她要去好莱坞 做电影明星了
She's gonna be a star in Hollywood.

679
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:17,373
只是一个试镜而已 爸爸
It's only a screen test, daddy.

680
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:19,442
一个银幕经纪人来了
A screen agent came here

681
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:21,644
挑中了几个姑娘
and picked out a few girls.

682
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:23,679
我哥哥就在那
My brother's out there.

683
00:46:23,681 --> 00:46:25,381
他在好莱坞吗
Your brother's in Hollywood?

684
00:46:25,383 --> 00:46:27,283
他说 他是个替身演员
He's a stuntman, I'm told.

685
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,986
就是那种从马上摔下来的人
Falling off horses.

686
00:46:29,988 --> 00:46:31,053
很高兴见到你 Figgis小姐
Pleased to meet you, miss.

687
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:33,055
警长 再见
Chief.

688
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:36,225
先生们 再见
Gentlemen.

689
00:46:36,227 --> 00:46:38,327
- 你吃香蕉不
- 不用了
- You're sure you don't want a banana?
- No, that's all right.

690
00:46:38,329 --> 00:46:41,664
- 在波士顿你可吃不到这种水果
- 我知道 看着挺好吃的
- You can't get fruit like this in Boston.
- No, I know. It looks good.

691
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,934
- 哦 她在那边
- 什么
- Uh-oh. Here she is.
- What?

692
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:46,969
- 好的
- 你看好了啊
- All right.
- Just watch this.

693
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,875
你好 午安
Hello. Good afternoon.

694
00:46:52,877 --> 00:46:55,144
- 你好吗
- 我很好 你呢
- How are you?
- I'm well. How are you?

695
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:57,013
我很好
Excellent.

696
00:46:57,015 --> 00:47:02,451
你和你哥哥决定好了吗 关于我们的交易
You, uh, have you and your brother come to
any decision on our...

697
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:05,054
还没 我们仍然在考虑呢 Coughlin先生
Not yet. We're still considering, Mr.Coughlin.

698
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:06,422
好吧
Okay.

699
00:47:06,424 --> 00:47:09,158
这对于我们来说将是非常重大的改变
Yes. It would be quite an upheaval for us.

700
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,726
当然了 我理解
I understand. Of course.

701
00:47:10,728 --> 00:47:12,895
要做出改变可不容易
We don't make changes easily.

702
00:47:12,897 --> 00:47:15,698
不过 一切都会改变的
Oh. There's all kind of change, you know.

703
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,434
我以前待的地方
Where I was recently staying

704
00:47:18,436 --> 00:47:20,903
我们经常下国际象棋
we used to play chess a lot

705
00:47:20,905 --> 00:47:23,072
每当你把你的卒子
and this is the kind of change where you
get your pawn

706
00:47:23,074 --> 00:47:24,207
走到棋盘另一端
to the end of the board

707
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:25,842
把它变成皇后的时候
and it changes into a queen.

708
00:47:25,844 --> 00:47:27,844
可不需要那么多深思熟虑
There's not a lot to think about here.

709
00:47:27,846 --> 00:47:30,780
- 我会下象棋
- 是吗
- Yes. I do play chess.
- You do?

710
00:47:30,782 --> 00:47:33,115
我父亲教过我
Yes. My father taught me.

711
00:47:33,117 --> 00:47:36,052
大概你也记得 不管是兵还是王
And what you might do well to remember is that
the pawn and the king

712
00:47:36,054 --> 00:47:38,588
最终都会回到同一个棋盒里
end up in the same box at the end of the game.

713
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:41,257
最终吗
The end?

714
00:47:41,259 --> 00:47:42,925
我们没在讨论结束的时候
It's not about the end.

715
00:47:42,927 --> 00:47:45,328
我们现在在讨论的是过程
It's about when you're playing the game.

716
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:48,464
结束的时候你可以把我吊起来 点火烧死
You could hang me upside down and light me
on fire at the end.

717
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:50,800
但是在下棋的过程中 我一定要赢
I wanna win while I'm playing.

718
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:56,806
我猜 大概你下过的棋 你都赢了吧
I have a feeling you win most
of the games you play.

719
00:47:57,741 --> 00:48:00,509
还没有 但我打算赢呢
Not yet. But I plan on it.

720
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:03,679
要跟我一起赢吗
Why don't you join me?

721
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:15,017
知道吗 有人说私酒只是副业
You know, some people say liquor is only
your side business.

722
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:16,252
是这样吗
Is that so?

723
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,454
事实上
In fact

724
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:21,090
我听说 你们把转来的钱都捐出去了
I heard rumors you give most of your
money away.

725
00:49:21,092 --> 00:49:22,758
都捐回古巴去了
A lot of it in Cuba.

726
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:25,895
你觉得这很蠢吗
And you think that's foolish?

727
00:49:25,897 --> 00:49:27,296
我没有说蠢
Not foolish.

728
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,732
只是 这不是我的使命而已
It's just not my cause, that's all.

729
00:49:29,734 --> 00:49:31,701
你的使命是什么
What is your cause?

730
00:49:31,703 --> 00:49:35,104
在这里做私酒生意
The distribution of demon rum.

731
00:49:35,106 --> 00:49:38,174
还有 一个人的生命不应该被他人左右
And that no man should rule
another man's life.

732
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:44,647
垄断了私酒市场 你就是国王了
If you corner the rum market, you will be a king.

733
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:46,782
还得对付Albert White
I'll still have to deal with Albert White.

734
00:49:46,784 --> 00:49:49,251
我想知道 你要怎么使用你得到的权力
But how will you hold the power once you have it?

735
00:49:49,253 --> 00:49:52,154
怎么 你觉得我不够强大吗
Why? You don't think I'm strong enough?

736
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:54,991
我觉得你不够残忍
I don't know if you're cruel enough.

737
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,527
而且 如果你很残忍的话
And if you are

738
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,796
我会很难过的
I will be very sad.

739
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:04,100
有权势的人不需要残忍
Powerful men don't have to be cruel.

740
00:50:04,102 --> 00:50:07,136
但是他们通常都很残忍
But they usually are.

741
00:50:07,138 --> 00:50:10,673
告诉我 你觉得高尚的人存在吗
Tell me something. Do you think there is
such a thing as a noble man?

742
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:12,875
我对高尚的人没有意见
I got nothing against noble men.

743
00:50:12,877 --> 00:50:15,077
但是他们一般都活不过四十岁
They just rarely live past 40.

744
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:19,782
我父亲为古巴解放而死
My father died for Cuba.

745
00:50:19,784 --> 00:50:22,218
母亲也因心碎死去了
My mother died of a broken heart.

746
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,621
他经常教导我和Esteban
He would often tell Esteban and I,

747
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:27,156
如果没有能够为之献出生命的信仰
"you cannot truly live

748
00:50:27,158 --> 00:50:29,925
就不能算真正活过
"unless there is something for which you would die."

749
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:33,329
他听上去像个好人
He sounds like a good man.

750
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:36,098
他确实是好人
He was.

751
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:33,155
我们永远不会成为爱人的
We will never be lovers.

752
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:35,024
不会吗
No?

753
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:39,361
为什么呢
Why is that?

754
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:43,866
我不会爱上你的
We will not be lovers.

755
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:52,434
<i>我们垄断了私酒市场 像国王一样享受生活
We cornered the rum market and lived like kings.</i>

756
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:56,772
知道吗 行了 快点的
You know what? Fine. Come on, hurry up.

757
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:02,511
<i>银行倒闭 工厂裁员
Banks collapsed.Jobs dried up.</i>

758
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,914
<i>但地下的罪恶
But vice, it seemed</i>

759
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:07,816
<i>对大萧条时代完全免疫
was depression-proof.</i>

760
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:17,927
<i>Suarez和Coughlin之间的合作关系
创造了难得的稳定收益
The Suarez-Coughlin partnership created a rare stability.</i>

761
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:38,948
<i>我们买通Albert在佛罗里达州中部的人
We paid off Albert's guys in central Florida</i>

762
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:42,218
<i>让他们停止武力抵抗
to put down their guns.</i>

763
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:46,422
<i>这样如果Albert White想要打击我们
他必须动用自己在迈阿密的人马
So when Albert wanted to hit us, he had</i>
<i>to use his Miami crews.</i>

764
00:53:50,194 --> 00:53:53,529
<i>他的人一出现 我们就对他们发起丛林伏击
And when they showed up, we bushwhacked them.</i>

765
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:15,117
<i>Albert在迈阿密过着流亡的生活
Albert was living on the run in Miami</i>

766
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:19,521
<i>我们也掌控了佛罗里达州中北部所有的酒吧
and there wasn't a speak in central or north Florida</i>
<i>we didn't sell to.</i>

767
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:55,291
找人来把火灭掉
Get something from in there and put this shit out.

768
00:54:55,293 --> 00:54:55,958
好的
All right.

769
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:00,362
都给我趴下
Get on the floor!

770
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:01,764

Get down, now!

Get on the floor. Get down!

772
00:55:04,502 --> 00:55:06,568
趴下
Get down! Get down!

773
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,173
天主教敢在我们的地盘卖私酒
This is what happens

774
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:13,909
就是这个下场
when catholics try to sell liquor down here.

775
00:55:13,911 --> 00:55:16,312
这家伙的名字叫RD Pruitt
The guy's name is RD Pruitt.

776
00:55:16,314 --> 00:55:18,981
好吧 那就去找到这人
Well, we'd better go find him.

777
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:20,549
他是三K党的人
He's in the Klan.

778
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:22,785
那又怎么样 全国有五百多万三K党
So what? So are 5 million other guys in this country.

779
00:55:22,787 --> 00:55:24,453
三K党都有病
The klan has a lot of fucking juice.

780
00:55:24,455 --> 00:55:26,689
不过是一群小学四年级就退学的杂种罢了
They're inbreds with fourth grade educations.

781
00:55:26,691 --> 00:55:28,457
他们肯定爱死你了
Oh, they're gonna love you.

782
00:55:28,459 --> 00:55:32,127
一个天主教徒 和有色人种工作 还和古巴女人同居
A catholic who works with coloreds and lives
with a Cuban.

783
00:55:32,129 --> 00:55:34,463

Bigger problem is RD's brother-in-law.

784

是谁
Who's he?

785
00:55:35,566 --> 00:55:37,066

我不跟天主教徒握手
Don't shake hands with papists.

788
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,255
无意冒犯
No offense.

789
00:56:00,257 --> 00:56:01,990
没事
None taken.

790
00:56:01,992 --> 00:56:04,660

却基本没去过教堂呢
Would it help if I told you I haven't been
to church in half my life?

791

好吧 是这样

RD,

793
00:56:11,502 --> 00:56:14,670
听说你在依伯惹了不少麻烦
word is you're causing trouble down in Ybor.

794
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,406
什么麻烦
How's that?

795
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:22,010
听说你总是袭击别人家的地方
Well, we hear you're sticking up places.

796
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:25,547
我可不知道怎么回事
I don't know a damn thing about that.

797
00:56:27,852 --> 00:56:30,886
我就是跟你们玩玩
I'm just playing with you.

798
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:32,654
你们知道的吧
You all know that.

799
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:36,558
RD
RD,

800
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:40,095
这是位生意人 来做生意的
this is a businessman
who's come here to do business.

801
00:56:40,097 --> 00:56:43,499
我建议你跟他做这笔生意
And I suggest that you do it with him.

802
00:56:43,501 --> 00:56:46,902
他是个私酒贩子
This man is a bootlegger

803
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,704
和黑鬼通奸的人
and a fornicator with niggers.

804
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:53,041
他需要为此受到惩罚
He needs to be tarred and feathered

805
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:55,411
还做什么生意
not done business with.

806
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:01,750
哈哈哈 我只是玩玩
I'm just playing.

807
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:03,118
你开得起玩笑吧
You can take a joke, right?

808
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,453
当然 你随便开我玩笑
Sure, I can take a joke.

809
00:57:04,455 --> 00:57:07,423
只要你不是别人的笑柄 对吧
Long as you don't become one, right?

810
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:13,929
听说你很喜欢我们的俱乐部Parisian 
So you like the Parisian, right?

811
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:15,631
如果我就是喜欢呢
And if I did?

812
00:57:15,633 --> 00:57:18,300
我可以让你分享俱乐部百分之十的收益
I might be able to cut you in on 10%
of the house take.

813
00:57:18,302 --> 00:57:20,335
- 可以吗
- 当然
- You'd do that?
- I would.

814
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:22,004
好吧
Well,

815
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:25,340
我觉得百分之十可不够
I ought to be worth more than 10%.

816
00:57:25,342 --> 00:57:26,909
那你说要多少
What were you thinking?

817
00:57:26,911 --> 00:57:28,610
百分之六十吧
I was thinking 60.

818
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:30,045
市里最大的一家俱乐部
60%?

819
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:31,680
百分之六十的利润吗
The biggest club in town?

820
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,515
对啊
That's right.

821
00:57:33,517 --> 00:57:35,484
凭什么
For what, exactly?

822
00:57:35,486 --> 00:57:38,086
这样的话 我的朋友看你的眼光
大概会善意那么一点点
My friends might look on you more kindly.

823
00:57:38,088 --> 00:57:40,322
- 什么朋友
- 我要百分之六十
- What friends?
- 60%.

824
00:57:40,324 --> 00:57:42,491
孩子 我不可能给你百分之六十
Son, I ain't giving you 60%.

825
00:57:42,493 --> 00:57:44,226
我不是你的孩子 
I ain't your son.

826
00:57:44,228 --> 00:57:46,094
我谁的孩子也不是
Ain't nobody's son.

827
00:57:46,096 --> 00:57:48,564
你爸爸可算是松了一口气 不用丢脸了
Save your father some embarrassment.

828
00:57:48,566 --> 00:57:50,599
- 你说什么
- 百分之十五
- What's that?
- 15%.

829
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:53,802
我打死你 你信吗
I will beat you to death.

830
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:55,070
你说什么
Excuse me?

831
00:57:56,105 --> 00:57:57,506
你猜怎么着
You know,

832
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:02,744
我觉得百分之十五挺公平的 真的不能给我百分之二十吗
that does sound like a fair arrangement.
You go to 20?

833
00:58:02,746 --> 00:58:06,482
我觉得对于一个不用出力工作的人 
百分之五十是很公平的
I think 15's pretty good for a job you don't have
to show up to work for.

834
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:10,352
好吧
Well,

835
00:58:11,187 --> 00:58:12,788
这个交易很公平
it's a fair deal

836
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:14,656
我很高兴能够达成这个协议
and I'm pleased to agree to it.

837
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,993
那么 我什么时候拿钱呢
How do I pick up my cut?

838
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:19,495
就在俱乐部里
Come by the Parisian.

839
00:58:19,497 --> 00:58:21,997
每个月的第二个周二 晚上7点钟
Second Tuesday, every month, 7:00.

840
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:23,765
好的 幸会 Coughlin先生
Pleasure, Mr. Coughlin.

841
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:25,734
Irv 再会
Irv.

842
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:34,843
这算是谈成了吧
Sounds like we have a deal.

843
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:40,215
这孩子像个脑子稀烂的蠢葡萄
Boy's dumb as a grape.

844
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:45,621
我搞不懂Maso想要做什么
I don't understand what Maso wants.

845
00:58:45,623 --> 00:58:49,224
失手被捕的几率降低了百分之七十
收入翻了三倍
Arrests are down 70%, revenue's up 300%.

846
00:58:49,226 --> 00:58:53,095
我不喜欢他现在派一个蠢孩子来给我当监工
I don't like getting some kid sent down here
like we need supervision.

847
00:58:53,097 --> 00:58:54,863
我们才不需要监工
No! We don't need supervision.

848
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:58,133
Digger只是来视察一下赌场的计划
和生意运行的情况
Digger wants to look at the casino option,
check progress, that's all.

849
00:58:58,135 --> 00:58:59,501
再回去跟老大报告一下
He's gonna report back to the old man.

850
00:58:59,503 --> 00:59:01,904
没什么 不要小题大做 Joe
It's a joke. Don't make a big thing of it.

851
00:59:01,906 --> 00:59:04,873
他儿子跟他汇报的事情 尤其是赌场 
Maso还是会听的吧
Maso's still gonna listen to what his son tells him
about starting a new casino.

852
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:06,375
别担心了
Don't worry about it.

853
00:59:06,377 --> 00:59:07,910
他怎么叫Digger这个名字
How did he get the name "Digger"?

854
00:59:07,912 --> 00:59:09,778
因为他就是个他妈的蠢货
Because he's a fucking dummy.

855
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:12,648
他在帮派里面就是给尸体挖坑的
All they let him do is dig ditches for
the bodies they bump off.

856
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,049
- 没骗人
- 没
- No shit?
- Yeah.

857
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,820
真好笑
That's great.

858
00:59:18,822 --> 00:59:21,290
<i>我提出一个投资赌场的计划
I'd come up with a plan to invest in a casino</i>

859
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:23,425
<i>就建在萨拉索塔
with stakeholders in Sarasota</i>

860
00:59:23,427 --> 00:59:26,328
<i>的丽兹酒店工程地上
at the new Ritz development site.</i>

861
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:28,063
丽兹酒店赌场
Ritz hotel and casino.

862
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:29,765
最高一层 A型的尖顶
Top shelf. A-one.

863
00:59:29,767 --> 00:59:31,033
就是我们的赌场
...right to the casino.

864
00:59:31,035 --> 00:59:32,768
最高级的娱乐场所
Absolute top-level resort.

865
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:35,704
不管你花不花钱赌博 都是非常好的度假体验
Extraordinary resort experience whether
you gamble or not.

866
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,544
<i>建赌场是非常巨大的工程
For such a violent business</i>

867
00:59:42,546 --> 00:59:44,846
<i>如果处理得当 我们将会为当地人提供数以百计的工作
it was populated with a surprising number of guys</i>

868
00:59:44,848 --> 00:59:47,449
<i>让他们维持生计
who were just putting food on the table.</i>

869
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:50,285
<i>这些人里 却不包括Digger
Digger wasn't one of those guys.</i>

870
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:54,356
就是这里
So this is it.

871
00:59:54,358 --> 00:59:56,592
禁酒法案不会永远存在 对吗
Volstead act won't last forever, right?

872
00:59:56,594 --> 00:59:59,528
私酒生意也不能永远做下去 禁酒结束了我们怎么办
What are we gonna do when prohibition ends?

873
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:01,096
当然是赌博
Gambling.

874
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:02,831
我们可以动用自己的人际关系 将赌博合法化
We use the connections we put together
to get it legalized.

875
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:05,100
然后这里就会成为唯一一家合法经营的赌场
And we're the only ones in place to run it.

876
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:06,468
就是这里吗
And this is it?

877
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,370
对 这里是丽兹酒店的地
It will be. Ritz longboat key.

878
01:00:08,372 --> 01:00:10,672
上周我刚和萨拉索塔的人谈过
I sat down with the owners in Sarasota last week.

879
01:00:10,674 --> 01:00:12,374
他们为什么要把这块地给我们
Why did they let us in?

880
01:00:12,376 --> 01:00:14,376
因为他们没有能力经营赌场 没法将赌博合法化
Because they can't get gambling legal, and they
can't run a casino.

881
01:00:14,378 --> 01:00:16,244
我们借他们的地 经营赌场
They own the property, we run the casino.

882
01:00:16,246 --> 01:00:18,180
然后利润五五分成
We chop the profits 50-50.

883
01:00:18,182 --> 01:00:19,781
等一等
Wait a minute.

884
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:22,951
我们有魔法棒吗 可以更改法律
Do we have a magic stick for changing laws?

885
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:24,453
我听说你已经把宾果赌博合法化了
I heard you got bingo legal.

886
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:28,156
是一步一步来的 首先得有先决条件——
It's a step. It's that prerequisite.
You gotta do one thing

887
01:00:28,158 --> 01:00:30,158
- 然后你——
- 我知道了 就是那个先决条件嘛
- and then you get--
- Yeah, I know. It was a prerequisite.

888
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,227
你奶奶可以来这里玩 可以在教堂里玩
Your grandmother can come down.
She'll play in the church.

889
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:34,930
宾果
Bingo!

890
01:00:34,932 --> 01:00:39,001
我们在塔拉哈西和萨拉索塔都有人筹集资金
Look, I got bagmen buying inspectors in
Tallahassee and Sarasota.

891
01:00:39,003 --> 01:00:42,371
甚至有人在州议会和国税局游说爱赌博的成员
I got guys going after senators and
IRS agents who gamble.

892
01:00:42,373 --> 01:00:43,972
如果我们能将赌博合法化
We get gambling legal

893
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,475
我们就能赚大钱了 还是合法的
we are rich. Legit.

894
01:00:46,477 --> 01:00:49,344
而且这是个长久生意
For the long fucking haul.

895
01:00:49,346 --> 01:00:51,480
这些我也会啊
I talk a good game, too.

896
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:53,682
不过我很喜欢你
But I like you.

897
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:58,520
这家伙可聪明了
He's a very smart boy.

898

<i>Maso对赌场的点子很狂热
Maso went crazy for the casino.</i>

<i>信的内容只有五个字

<i>同样的信 同样的内容
Same note. Same message.</i>

我们已经尽力了 这家伙有人罩着呢
We're doing everything we can, but he's protected.

905
01:02:20,337 --> 01:02:22,471
他在这里扎根太深
His roots here are too deep.

906
01:02:22,473 --> 01:02:25,440

Ain't too many people ever had much success doing that.

911
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:52,734
我们这不来让您试一试吗
We'd like you to try.

912
01:02:52,736 --> 01:02:54,603
为什么呢
And what would the reason be?

913
01:02:54,605 --> 01:02:56,037
为了他的个人安危
His self-preservation.

914
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:58,640
他需要停止袭击我的俱乐部

Clubs?

什么俱乐部 桥牌俱乐部吗
What kind of clubs? Bridge clubs?

917

01:03:24,535 --> 01:03:28,236
是因为让你们这群愚蠢的混蛋踩在我们头上吗
by letting some inbred shit pickers muscle us?

926
01:03:28,238 --> 01:03:33,074
如果你认为我们是愚蠢的混蛋的话 
那你可是犯下致命大错了 孩子
If that's who you think we are, you're making
a fatal miscalculation, son.

927
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:37,412
因为我们管着金钱和银行
'Cause we're clerks and bankers

928
01:03:37,414 --> 01:03:40,415
管着所有的警察
and police officers and deputies and...

929
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:42,417
甚至手下还有一名法官
Hell, we even got a judge.

930
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,388
如果你没有足够的能力对抗我们
And if you're dim enough to fight us

931
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:49,591
我们会将地狱之火降临到你
we're gonna rain bloody hellfire down on you

932
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:53,094
和你所爱的人身上
and all you love.

933
01:03:53,096 --> 01:03:56,631
这么说 你是用比你更有权势的人威胁我 对吗
So you're threatening me with people who are
more powerful than you?

934
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,100
没错
Exactly.

935
01:03:59,102 --> 01:04:00,702
那我还跟你说个屁啊
What the fuck am i talking to you for?

936
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:34,870
什么风把你吹来我家了
You've come to my home.

937
01:04:34,872 --> 01:04:37,072
省得你大动干戈地抓我过来了
Thought I'd save you the trouble of hauling me in.

938
01:04:37,074 --> 01:04:38,473
七十五名证人
75 witnesses.

939
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:41,142
没有一个愿站出来的
Not a one will come forward.

940
01:04:41,144 --> 01:04:43,411
来瓶啤酒吗
You want a beer?

941
01:04:43,413 --> 01:04:46,214
跟啤酒差不多 但也不差
It's near beer, but it ain't bad.

942
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:47,849
好啊 来一瓶
I'd love one.

943
01:04:58,361 --> 01:04:59,828
谢了
Thanks.

944
01:05:11,707 --> 01:05:13,775
警长 我需要和RD见面
I need RD, chief.

945
01:05:13,777 --> 01:05:16,478
我就知道你会这么说
I expect you'd feel that way.

946
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:20,448
你知道如果不帮我的话 会造成什么后果吗
You know what happens if you don't help me.

947
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:24,019
不 不知道
No. I don't.

948
01:05:24,021 --> 01:05:26,054
更多的尸体会堆积成山
More bodies are gonna pile up.

949
01:05:26,056 --> 01:05:29,791
今天雪茄城屠杀那样的事件会接连登上头条
More articles like "cigar city slaughter"
are gonna get written.

950
01:05:30,893 --> 01:05:33,495
你也会被清除掉
And the chief's gonna get pushed out.

951
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:36,364
你呢 也会
You, too.

952
01:05:36,366 --> 01:05:37,666
也许吧
Maybe.

953
01:05:37,668 --> 01:05:40,201
不同的是 当你被“肃清”时
Difference is, when you get pushed out

954
01:05:40,203 --> 01:05:44,673
会是被来自耳后的子弹打穿后脑
someone does it with a bullet to the back
of your ear.

955
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:51,246
我不会再出卖我的妻弟了
I'm not selling out my wife's brother.

956
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:56,885
我不想这么做
I don't wanna do this.

957
01:05:56,887 --> 01:05:58,053
做什么
Do what?

958
01:05:58,055 --> 01:05:59,754
不想做你逼我做的事情
I don't wanna do what you're making me do.

959
01:05:59,756 --> 01:06:02,090
我没有逼你啊
I'm not making you do anything.

960
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,225
你有
Yeah, you are.

961
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,130
怎么
What?

962
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:11,833
她没去成好莱坞
She didn't make it to Hollywood.

963
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:15,503
只是流落在洛杉矶而已
She just made it to Los Angeles.

964
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:38,793
这不是真的
That's not right.

965
01:06:38,795 --> 01:06:41,529
我们给她找了个专科的医生
We got her witha special doctor now.

966
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:43,131
她已经没事了
She's all right.

967
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:47,569
什么样的医生？
What kind of doctor?

968
01:06:47,571 --> 01:06:50,238
帮人们戒掉海洛因的医生 Irv
Kind that gets people off heroin, Irv.

969
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:55,877
永远不许直呼我的教名
You do not ever call me by my Christian name.

970
01:06:56,879 --> 01:06:59,280
我们谈话时 无论何年何月
You'll call me chief figgis

971
01:06:59,282 --> 01:07:03,018
你只能叫我Figgis警长
for whatever years or days remain in our acquaintance.

972
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:04,152
你明白了吗
Are we clear?

973
01:07:04,154 --> 01:07:05,353
她现在这样 不是我害的
I didn't do this to her.

974
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:07,155
请告诉我
You just name your price

975
01:07:07,157 --> 01:07:09,624
我要做什么 你才肯告诉我我女儿在哪
for telling me where my daughter is.

976
01:07:09,626 --> 01:07:11,393
她现在在一个干净又安全的戒毒中心
She's in a clean, safe facility

977
01:07:11,395 --> 01:07:14,162
我还不打算告诉你在哪 直到——
and I'm not gonna tell you where she
is until you...

978
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:17,899
直到什么
Until?

979
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:03,945
<i>RD 你得跟那小子见一面 
Rd, you are gonna meet with this boy again</i>

980
01:08:03,947 --> 01:08:07,682
<i>就谈这件事 这会是最后一次见面了
and there ain't another discussion to be</i>
<i>had on the matter.</i>

981
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:20,695
<i>对 就咱们俩
Yeah, it'll just be the two of us.</i>

982
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:25,500
<i>在丽兹酒店那块地
Longboat key by the ritz.</i>

984
01:08:25,502 --> 01:08:27,202
<i>今晚十点
Tonight at 10:00.</i>

985
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:37,712
我什么时候才能知道女儿的具体地址
When do I get her location?

986
01:08:37,714 --> 01:08:40,215
如果我跟RD见面后活着回来 就告诉你
Soon as I get out of this meeting alive.

987
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:43,318
请你亲自动手
You do it yourself.

988
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:45,687
什么
What's that?

989
01:08:45,689 --> 01:08:47,822
如果你要杀他的话
If you're gonna kill him

990
01:08:47,824 --> 01:08:50,058
拿出真男人的勇气来 亲自扣下扳机
be man enough to pull the trigger.

991
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:55,130
让你的手下杀人是耻辱 你太软弱 连扳机都不敢扣
Ain't no pride in having other people do what you're
too weak to do yourself.

992
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:57,532
好的
Okay.

993
01:08:57,534 --> 01:09:01,369
据我所知 扣下扳机没有那么难
In my experience, it doesn't take much
to pull a trigger.

994
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,601
你好 RD
Hey, rd.

995
01:09:33,603 --> 01:09:35,703
我姐夫呢
Where's my brother-in-law?

996
01:09:35,705 --> 01:09:37,505
他没跟来
He didn't come.

997
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:38,640
小子们
Boys,

998
01:09:38,642 --> 01:09:40,909
这位可很厉害的
this one here is rat tricky.

999
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,747
一枪就把你眼珠子打出来
Take your eyes off that peashooter

1000
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:48,349
我跟你保证 你绝对斗不过他
I promise it'll be in his hands.

1001
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:49,784
行吧
Not likely.

1002
01:09:55,057 --> 01:09:57,192
你说话算话吗
You a man of your word?

1003
01:09:57,194 --> 01:09:59,060
要看是对谁了
Depends on who i give it to.

1004
01:10:00,262 --> 01:10:02,797
那么你不是像我要求的那样一个人来的咯
So, you ain't come alone like I ordered?

1005
01:10:02,799 --> 01:10:05,433
妈的 倒被你看穿了 没意思
Shit, rd, that would spoil the fun.

1006
01:10:08,637 --> 01:10:10,705
人都在哪呢
Where they at?

1007
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:12,941
你知道吗 这可能是禁酒令结束后
You know, this could be the biggest casino
in the United States

1008
01:10:12,943 --> 01:10:14,676
整个美国最大的赌场
when they end prohibition?

1009
01:10:14,678 --> 01:10:16,878
如此虔诚的国家 禁酒是不会结束的
They ain't gonna end prohibition in
a god-fearing country.

1010
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,413
整个国家都要完蛋了
Country's in the tank.

1011
01:10:18,415 --> 01:10:20,782
银行和城市破产
Banks going under, cities are bankrupt.

1012
01:10:20,784 --> 01:10:22,917
因为我们选了个共产党当总统
Because we got a communist president.

1013
01:10:22,919 --> 01:10:24,886
因为我们没有了贩酒的税收
Because we're not taxing liquor.

1014
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:28,122
所以政府一定会立法将赌博合法化
And that's why the state's gonna change its laws
to legalize gambling.

1015
01:10:28,124 --> 01:10:29,524
说不定你能跟我们一起干
And you could be part of that.

1016
01:10:29,526 --> 01:10:32,193
我不想跟你一起干
I don't wanna be a part of nothing with you.

1017
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,468
他给你多少钱
How much is he paying you?

1018
01:10:41,036 --> 01:10:42,303
谁
Who?

1019
01:10:42,305 --> 01:10:43,571
Albert White
Albert white.

1020
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:46,040
他给你多少钱 让你袭击我的酒吧和俱乐部
How much is he paying you to shoot up my speaks?

1021
01:10:46,042 --> 01:10:48,376
你真是他的好狗腿
Because you're doing a hell of a job for him.

1022
01:10:50,713 --> 01:10:53,348
好吧 我是拿了他的臭钱
Yeah, I took his catholic money.

1023
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:56,251
你知道为什么吗
You know why?

1024
01:10:56,253 --> 01:10:58,052
不给钱我也给他做
Because I'd have done it for free.

1025
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:01,723
你是一条害虫
You are a pestilence.

1026
01:11:01,725 --> 01:11:04,058
你和你的黑鬼古巴妓女
You and your nigger whore girlfriend

1027
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:06,394
还有意大利流氓哥们儿
and your dirty dago friends.

1028
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:09,530
我要抢走你的俱乐部
I'mma take the Parisian.

1029
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:12,533
这次不要百分之六十
Not 60%.

1030
01:11:12,535 --> 01:11:14,802
我要百分之百
The whole thing.

1031
01:11:14,804 --> 01:11:17,138
我要把你所有的俱乐部都收了
I'mma take all your clubs.

1032
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:19,374
我要夺走你拥有的一切
I'mma take everything you got.

1033
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:23,745
大概还会顺便路过你家
Might even go by your house

1034
01:11:23,747 --> 01:11:27,649
操你那个黑鬼女人 再把她喉咙割开
tear off a piece of that nigger girl before
i cut her throat.

1035
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:31,586
你可能还不明白我说的话
You ain't got this yet

1036
01:11:31,588 --> 01:11:34,022
你要滚蛋了
but you leaving town, boy.

1037
01:11:34,024 --> 01:11:36,858
连行李都没来得及收拾
You just forgot to pack your bags.

1038
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:40,228
好吧
All right.

1039
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:41,963
上吧
Go ahead.

1040
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,008
操
Fuck.

1041
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:55,710
哦 糟糕
Oh, shit.

1042
01:11:55,712 --> 01:11:56,978
坏了
Shit.

1043
01:11:57,613 --> 01:11:59,314
把车开过来
Bring the car around.

1044
01:11:59,316 --> 01:12:00,448
好了
All right.

1045
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:02,317
- 我们马上带你去找医生
- 妈的 疼死了
- We'll get you to a doc.
- Fuck. It hurts.

1046
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:05,053
知道 没事 疼不死你
Yeah. It hurts, but it's not gonna kill you.

1047
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:08,823
哦 该死
Oh, shit.

1048
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:12,026
我不应该给他看那些照片的
Oh, fuck. We should have never shown him the pictures.

1049
01:12:12,028 --> 01:12:14,595
- 什么照片
- 给Figgis看的照片
- What pictures?
- Figgis.

1050
01:12:14,597 --> 01:12:17,398
为了把这混蛋解决掉 你没有别的选择
That's what we had to do
to put this fucking guy down.

1051
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,400
代价太高昂了
Price was too high.

1052
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:22,704
我怎么觉得是你开枪打伤我的
I think it was you who shot me.

1053
01:12:22,706 --> 01:12:24,806
- 啥
- RD还没来得及开枪就被我干掉了
- What?
- I got him before he got a shot off.

1054
01:12:24,808 --> 01:12:26,941
- 咋成了我了
- 那能是谁呢 不可能是别人
- It wasn't me who shot you.
I- t couldn't have been nobody else.

1055
01:12:26,943 --> 01:12:29,344
- Fasani在另一边呢
- 对啊 就是该死的Fasani打伤你的
- Fasani was back there.
- It was Fasani who fucking shot you.

1056
01:12:29,346 --> 01:12:31,379
不对 Fasani是从后面过来的
No, Fasani was coming from back there.

1057
01:12:31,381 --> 01:12:33,147
- Fasani在后面 他——
- 对啊 Fasani后边来的 向这里开枪
- Fasani came over here.
- Fasani was back there shooting this way.

1058
01:12:33,149 --> 01:12:34,916
他从这个角度打伤你 就是这里
He came on this angle like this. Right here.

1059
01:12:34,918 --> 01:12:36,217
我一直在这边呢
I was over here.

1060
01:12:36,219 --> 01:12:38,353
- 我干掉了这些个混蛋

01:22:06,555 --> 01:22:08,522
怎么会不想呢
Of course, you do.

1196
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:12,660
Figgis小姐 你是位漂亮的姑娘
Miss figgis, you're a lovely woman.

1197
01:22:12,662 --> 01:22:14,561
你的故事很精彩
And your story is amazing.

1198
01:22:14,563 --> 01:22:17,798
我丝毫不奇怪 你的听众会在这几天内翻三倍
I'm not surprised the flock's up threefold
since you started here.

1199
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,367
其实翻了五倍
More like five times.

1200
01:22:20,369 --> 01:22:23,871
在禁酒的十年里 人们消费的酒 比过去哪一年都多
More booze has been drunk in the last
10 years than ever before.

1201
01:22:23,873 --> 01:22:26,707
因为人们不想被强制禁酒
Because people don't wanna be told they can't do it.

1202
01:22:26,709 --> 01:22:30,010
通奸也是同样的道理
The same could be said of fornication.

1203
01:22:30,012 --> 01:22:31,445
人们都想通奸
People want it

1204
01:22:31,447 --> 01:22:33,747
但是不想被强制禁止
but don't want to be told they can't have it.

1205
01:22:33,749 --> 01:22:35,082
当然不想了
Well, nor should they.

1206
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:37,351
抱歉 你说什么
I'm sorry?

1207
01:22:37,353 --> 01:22:39,753
人们想要通奸 干嘛要阻止他们
If people want to fornicate, I see
no reason to stop them.

1208
01:22:39,755 --> 01:22:43,023
如果他们想与动物通奸呢
And if they wish to lie down with animals?

1209
01:22:43,025 --> 01:22:44,591
真的吗
Do they?

1210
01:22:44,593 --> 01:22:46,060
怎么
I'm sorry?

1211
01:22:46,062 --> 01:22:47,861
人们想和动物通奸吗
Do people wish to lie down with animals?

1212
01:22:47,863 --> 01:22:49,196
有些人想
Some do.

1213
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:51,532
如果都像你这样 他们的罪恶就会传染
And their sickness will spread if you have your way.

1214
01:22:51,534 --> 01:22:54,234
原谅我 我看不出兽交和禁酒有什么关系
Forgive me. I see no correlation between alcohol
and lying down with animals.

1215
01:22:54,236 --> 01:22:56,870
它们都是罪恶
There's a correlation across all sin.

1216
01:22:56,872 --> 01:22:59,573
都违抗了上帝的意愿
It is all against the wishes of god

1217
01:22:59,575 --> 01:23:02,977
因此都是不能被容忍的
therefore, all equally offensive.

1218
01:23:02,979 --> 01:23:07,114
容我道个歉 我可能说错了话
Let me apologize. I think we got off on the wrong foot here.

1219
01:23:07,116 --> 01:23:08,649
我只是想请求你
I'm just here to ask you

1220
01:23:08,651 --> 01:23:10,884
如果你愿意在你的布道中
if you would be amenable to omitting

1221
01:23:10,886 --> 01:23:13,620
略去赌博和赌场的部分
the casino issue from your sermons

1222
01:23:13,622 --> 01:23:15,489
为表感谢
and in exchange

1223
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:17,358
我们会带来广大的商业机会
we're gonna bring a business here.

1224
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:18,859
和无数的工作岗位
Business will create jobs

1225
01:23:18,861 --> 01:23:21,462
这大概能抵消这里随贫穷而来的罪恶
which will reduce the sinfulness

1226
01:23:21,464 --> 01:23:24,264
扶助贫困 分配闲散劳动力
that comes with poverty and idle hands.

1227
01:23:24,266 --> 01:23:26,400
我们也会支持教堂 
We'd be willing to contribute to the church.

1228
01:23:26,402 --> 01:23:29,536
甚至乐意帮您建造几座教堂
Hell, we'd be willing to build a few churches.

1229
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:39,546
如果上帝改写了圣经 将赌博写在罪恶之外
If god rewrites the Bible to cast gambling
as virtuous

1230
01:23:39,548 --> 01:23:42,750
我很乐意改写自己的布道内容
I will refrain from speaking against it.

1231
01:23:42,752 --> 01:23:45,185
但到目前为止
But until then

1232
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:49,023
我们并没有资格去决定什么是罪 Coughlin先生
we don't get to pick our sins, Mr. coughlin.

1233
01:23:54,262 --> 01:23:55,896
我做不到
I can't do it.

1234
01:23:56,431 --> 01:23:58,399
什么
What?

1235
01:23:58,401 --> 01:24:00,434
她会毁掉我们的整个计划  你却说你做不到
She's gonna fuck up the whole deal. What do you
mean you can't do it?

1236
01:24:00,436 --> 01:24:03,570
我知道 我只是伤害不了她
I know. No one touches her.

1237
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:07,174
这是个错误
That's a mistake.

1238
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:10,177
我知道
No shit.

1239
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:25,659
你们想喝点什么吗
Can we get you anything?

1240
01:24:25,661 --> 01:24:27,861
不用了 谢谢
Oh, we're okay. Thanks.

1241
01:24:27,863 --> 01:24:31,965
我知道你们都很忙 也不想浪费你们的时间
We know you men are busy and we don't want
to waste your time.

1242
01:24:31,967 --> 01:24:35,669
我们不会投资丽兹酒店的赌场了
We're not going to invest in the casino at the ritz.

1243
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:40,874
你确定吗
Are you sure about that?

1244
01:24:40,876 --> 01:24:43,977
恐怕我得说是了 公众反响太严重了
I'm afraid so. The publicity is too much.

1245
01:24:43,979 --> 01:24:46,046
就因为一个在他妈的帐篷里布道的女人吗
One woman preaching in a fucking tent?

1246
01:24:46,048 --> 01:24:50,784
是的 因为赌场占了我们百分之二的股份
Yes, because the casino would represent only 2%
of our total holdings.

1247
01:24:50,786 --> 01:24:56,356
你们是让虔诚的白人基督徒女孩染上毒瘾的爱尔兰人和意大利天主教徒
And we can't appear to be a company of Irish
and Italian catholics

1248
01:24:56,358 --> 01:25:00,260
我们不能让这种人代表我们的企业
turning white protestant girls into drug addicts.

1249
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:03,730
我的老板不会欣赏你的决定的
The people I work for are gonna be very upset about this.

1250
01:25:03,732 --> 01:25:06,266
我们不会被打倒 或者被欺骗
We aren't men to be muscled or conned.

1251
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:09,903
我们是事业机构 你不能贿赂或恐吓我
We're an institution. We can't be bribed or bullied

1252
01:25:09,905 --> 01:25:12,506
因为我代表的
because I simply represent the vested interest

1253
01:25:12,508 --> 01:25:14,108
是政府高官的投资意向
of a board of governors.

1254
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:17,277
我们是这个国家的白人地主贵族
We are the landed white gentry in this country

1255
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:22,149
并不想割让出一块
and we have no plans to carve off a strip
of this country

1256
01:25:22,151 --> 01:25:25,452
我们历尽艰辛 才夺下并殖民的土地
which we have gone to great pains
to break and colonize

1257
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:29,056
把她交给天主教徒 犹太佬  黑鬼 
and hand it over to catholics, Jews, darkies

1258
01:25:29,058 --> 01:25:32,126
或者意大利佬
or dagos.

1259
01:25:32,128 --> 01:25:34,928
这只不过是一场更大更吵的集会而已
It's just a bigger, better racket. That's all.

1260
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:38,665
钱在你我这样的人手中流来流去
Keeping the money in your hands and out of the
hands of people like us.

1261
01:25:41,736 --> 01:25:44,138
所有你提到过的那些人
All those people,

1262
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:45,706
那些黑鬼们 
the negro

1263
01:25:45,708 --> 01:25:49,543
你们踩着人家的脊背建立的国家
on whose back you went to great pains
to break this country

1264
01:25:49,545 --> 01:25:52,279
那些移民 一穷二白
and the immigrants who came over here with nothing

1265
01:25:52,281 --> 01:25:56,049
拼着命工作 真心相信着
and worked their fingers to the fucking bone,
all believed it

1266
01:25:56,051 --> 01:25:58,752
你们所说的 人人都可以功成名就的鬼话
when you told them they could get ahead.

1267
01:25:58,754 --> 01:26:00,020
我可能活不到那么久 
And one day, and I may not live to see it

1268
01:26:00,022 --> 01:26:02,422
但是他们总有一天会想明白的
they're gonna figure it out.

1269
01:26:02,424 --> 01:26:05,659
我告诉你 到那时候 
But I tell you what. I'd hate to fucking be you.

1270
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:08,395
我可不想像你一样 夹在这群人
Standing between those people

1271
01:26:08,397 --> 01:26:10,297
和他们应得的命运之间
and what they deserve.

1272
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:15,302
祝你好运 混蛋
Good luck to you. Prick!

1273
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:21,375
本来可以建个好赌场的
Would have been a hell of a casino.

1274
01:26:21,377 --> 01:26:23,810
没关系 你还有机会
You'll get another chance.

1275
01:26:23,812 --> 01:26:26,413
事情总会峰回路转的
Things swing back around.

1276
01:26:26,415 --> 01:26:28,582
并不是所有的事都会峰回路转
Not all things.

1277
01:26:28,584 --> 01:26:31,985
<i>我们回去的路上 听到了广播里的消息
They announced it on the radio just when</i>
<i>we got back.</i>

1278
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:37,791
<i>刚刚竞选成功的富兰克林·罗斯福总统
President-elect Roosevelt promised to sign</i>
<i>the Cullen-Harrison act</i>

1279
01:26:37,793 --> 01:26:39,626
<i>承诺签署库伦-哈里森法案
the minute he was elected,</i>

1280
01:26:39,628 --> 01:26:42,796
<i>全面开放禁酒
effectively ending prohibition.</i>

1281
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:22,903
- 你好 Figgis小姐
- 你好 Coughlin先生
- Hello, miss figgis.
- Mr. coughlin.

1282
01:27:22,905 --> 01:27:24,171
- 我能坐下吗
- 可以
- May I?
- Yes.

1283
01:27:24,173 --> 01:27:26,240
- 就坐一会 好吗
- 当然 请坐
- Just for a minute?
- Yeah. Please sit.

1284
01:27:28,109 --> 01:27:30,110
你看上去很不错
You're looking very well.

1285
01:27:31,379 --> 01:27:34,848
我看 你今天没穿白色衣服啊
I see, uh, you're not wearing white.

1286
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:37,451
这件和白色差不多
It's almost white.

1287
01:27:37,453 --> 01:27:39,186
您需要点餐吗
Would you like a menu?

1288
01:27:39,188 --> 01:27:40,287
谢谢 先给我一杯咖啡好吗
Thank you very much. Could I have a cup
of coffee, please?

1289
01:27:40,289 --> 01:27:41,355
好的
Sure.

1290
01:27:44,325 --> 01:27:45,392
谢谢
Thank you.

1291
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:55,269
为什么我父亲那么恨你
Why does my father hate you so much?

1292
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:01,008
我是个罪犯 他是警长
I'm a crook. He's the chief of police.

1293
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:02,776
他当然会讨厌我了
That's how it goes, I guess.

1294
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:05,145
不是的 他曾经很喜欢你
No. He liked you.

1295
01:28:05,147 --> 01:28:07,347
他说你是依伯市长
He said you were the mayor of ybor.

1296
01:28:07,349 --> 01:28:09,416
- 他真的这么说过吗
- 嗯
- Is that what he said?
- Mmm.

1297
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:15,422
你对他做了什么
What did you do?

1298
01:28:18,226 --> 01:28:20,027
对他吗
To him?

1299
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,908
我们有照片
We had photographs.

1300
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:41,515
你给他看了
And you showed them to him.

1301
01:28:41,517 --> 01:28:43,650
我给他看了两张
I showed him two.

1302
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:45,952
一共有多少张照片
How many did you have?

1303
01:28:46,587 --> 01:28:48,322
全部都有
All of them.

1304
01:28:53,528 --> 01:28:55,929
我们都要下地狱了
We're all going to hell.

1305
01:28:57,098 --> 01:28:59,533
我觉得 你不会下地狱的
I don't think you're going to hell.

1306
01:28:59,535 --> 01:29:04,071
从这段将灵魂投身于上帝的经历中 
You know what I learned as I've been

1308
01:29:04,073 --> 01:29:06,807
你知道我学到了什么吗 
thrusting my soul out to god?

1309
01:29:06,809 --> 01:29:08,208
什么
What?

1310
01:29:09,711 --> 01:29:12,079
这就是天堂
This is heaven.

1311
01:29:13,281 --> 01:29:14,648
就在这里
Right here.

1312
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:17,351
我们身在其中
We're in it now.

1313
01:29:17,353 --> 01:29:19,753
那为什么这一切都感觉像地狱呢
Then how come it looks like hell?

1314
01:29:19,755 --> 01:29:21,822
因为我们搞砸了一切
Because we fucked it all up.

1315
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:32,966
在我的审判结束后
After my trials,

1316
01:29:36,504 --> 01:29:39,373
我睡在自己童年的床上
I slept in the bed of my childhood.

1317
01:29:43,244 --> 01:29:45,545
那种脚踏实地的感觉又回来了
I felt certain again.

1318
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:48,982
我很怀念那种感觉
I missed that.

1319
01:29:54,255 --> 01:29:56,990
我不知道到底有没有上帝
I don't know if there is a god.

1320
01:30:00,628 --> 01:30:02,662
但我希望有
But I hope there is.

1321
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:08,168
而且我希望他是个善良的人
And I hope he's kind.

1322
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:13,039
那该多好
Wouldn't that be swell?

1323
01:30:16,778 --> 01:30:18,545
是啊 那该多好
Yes, it would be.

1324
01:30:25,287 --> 01:30:28,488
你看起来并不绝望 你有什么秘诀吗
You seem not to despair. Do you have a secret?

1325
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:30,424
哪有什么秘诀
No. No secrets.

1326
01:30:31,759 --> 01:30:33,460
大概是因为我有个好妻子
I have my wife.

1327
01:30:34,896 --> 01:30:36,930
这就够了
That's enough.

1328
01:30:36,932 --> 01:30:39,166
如果你失去她怎么办
But what if you lose her?

1329
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:45,705
你接下来想做些什么
What are you gonna do now?

1330
01:30:46,707 --> 01:30:48,375
你说什么
What do you mean?

1331
01:30:48,377 --> 01:30:51,311
01:30:48,005 --> 01:30:50,405
你成功地阻止了我 阻止了赌场的建立
You stopped me. Stopped the casino.

1332
01:30:51,313 --> 01:30:54,347
法律没有做到 人民没有做到
Law couldn't do it. The people couldn't do it.

1333
01:30:54,349 --> 01:30:56,783
三K党都无法做到的事
The klan couldn't do it.

1334
01:30:56,785 --> 01:30:57,918
你做到了
You did it.

1335
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,586
我并没有把酒精完全驱逐
I didn't get rid of alcohol.

1336
01:30:59,588 --> 01:31:01,388
那个目标太大了
No. That was too big.

1337
01:31:01,390 --> 01:31:04,958
但是你确实驱逐了赌博
在你没出现之前 我的赌场已经是板上钉钉的生意
But you've stopped gambling and before you came
along, that was a lock.

1338
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,927
我的确做到了 对吧
I did do that, didn't I?

1339
01:31:06,929 --> 01:31:08,995
是的 你做到了
Yes, you did.

1340
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:13,600
你父亲呢 打算做什么
What's your father gonna do?

1341
01:31:14,802 --> 01:31:17,070
坐在他的椅子上吧 大概
Sit in his chair, I guess.

1342
01:31:17,605 --> 01:31:20,607
被愤怒盲目了双眼
Blind with rage

1343
01:31:20,609 --> 01:31:23,710
因为竟有其他的男人 像他自己对待妻子一样对待他的女儿 
that men touched his daughter the way he used
to touch his wife.

1344
01:31:23,712 --> 01:31:25,412
甚至更可怕
And worse.

1345
01:31:31,085 --> 01:31:36,556
他在房间里踱步 一遍又一遍地低诉
He goes around the house whispering
one word over and over.

1346
01:31:36,558 --> 01:31:38,124
说什么
What word?

1347
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:40,560
忏悔 
Repent.

1348
01:31:43,965 --> 01:31:47,367
忏悔 忏悔
Repent, repent.

1349
01:31:49,570 --> 01:31:52,439
给他些时间 他会缓过来的
Give him some time. Maybe he'll come out of it.

1350
01:32:27,608 --> 01:32:30,610
波士顿的消息 所有三条运货车都正常到达
We heard from Boston. All three trucks made
it up there fine.

1351
01:32:30,612 --> 01:32:32,779
利润也没什么问题 一切正常
Same payoffs as last week, so it's no problem.

1352
01:32:32,781 --> 01:32:34,247
很好
Good. Good, good.

1353
01:32:34,249 --> 01:32:37,551
还有 Loretta Figgis昨天割喉自杀了
And Loretta figgis cut her own throat yesterday.

1354
01:32:38,653 --> 01:32:40,020
什么
What?

1355
01:32:40,022 --> 01:32:42,422
昨天她在家自杀的 据说就在她父亲的床上
Yeah, she did it at home in the chief's bed, they say.

1356
01:32:44,292 --> 01:32:45,559
我还挺佩服她的
Gotta give it to her.

1357
01:32:46,694 --> 01:32:50,096
她还挺有胆的 我可没法这样去死
She's got moxie. I couldn't do that.

1358
01:32:50,098 --> 01:32:52,832
有些事就是命中注定吧
I don't know, i guess some things are meant to be.

1359
01:32:52,834 --> 01:32:54,568
不过 如果她早三个月自杀
Hell, she could've done it three months earlier...

1360
01:32:54,570 --> 01:32:56,169
那可是帮了我们大忙了
And done us all a fucking favor.

1361
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:00,206
太迟了 唉
Too late.

1361
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:05,338
圣 母 玛 利 亚 之 死

1362
01:33:13,621 --> 01:33:16,323
不要责怪自己
You blame yourself?

1363
01:33:16,325 --> 01:33:19,659
她去了西部 就像很多往那面跑的姑娘一样
She went out west as so many other girls do.

1364
01:33:19,661 --> 01:33:21,661
她只是被当成猎物捕获了
And she was preyed upon.

1365
01:33:21,663 --> 01:33:22,929
当然 不是被你捕获的
Not by you.

1366
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:24,598
但她是被像我一样的人捕获的
By men like me.

1367
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:27,734
像我们一样 有酒 有女人
Men who get the booze, they get the girls...

1368
01:33:27,736 --> 01:33:29,402
有毒品
They get the drugs.

1369
01:33:29,404 --> 01:33:31,404
一只手洗白另一只手上的罪恶
One hand washes the other.

1370
01:33:35,209 --> 01:33:37,177
我们并不是别人的守护神
We are not our brother's keeper.

1371
01:33:37,179 --> 01:33:40,814
事实上 如果我们认为别人需要我们的守护 
这对他人也是一种侮辱
In fact, it is an insult to our brother
to believe we are.

1372
01:33:40,816 --> 01:33:42,482
看看这些人
Look at these people.

1373
01:33:43,384 --> 01:33:47,287
看这个人 如果他是个酒鬼 喝酒喝死了
If this man, say, dies of drunkenness

1374
01:33:47,289 --> 01:33:49,489
这也是我们的错吗
is it our fault?

1375
01:33:52,426 --> 01:33:54,628
这张照片什么时候拍的
When did you take this picture?

1376
01:33:55,763 --> 01:33:57,430
一个月前
A month ago.

1377
01:33:58,165 --> 01:33:59,799
你确定吗
Are you sure?

1378
01:34:01,535 --> 01:34:05,905
我自己拍的 一个月零三天前 
I took this picture myself a month and three days ago.

1379
01:34:05,907 --> 01:34:07,273
怎么了
Why?

1380
01:34:08,242 --> 01:34:10,844
因为照片上的女人 1927年就已经死了
Because that woman died in 1927.

1381
01:34:53,487 --> 01:34:56,856
我一生从没遇到过像你这样的女人
There has never been anyone like you in my life.

1382
01:34:58,592 --> 01:35:01,294
总有一天 我成为一个配得上你的好人
And one day, I'm gonna be good enough for you.

1383
01:35:03,497 --> 01:35:05,165
你确定这是她吗 
Are you sure it's her?

1384
01:35:05,167 --> 01:35:06,433
你说呢
You tell me.

1385
01:35:07,301 --> 01:35:08,568
你告诉Graciela了吗
You tell graciela?

1386
01:35:08,570 --> 01:35:09,903
当然告了 你信吗
Of course I told her.

1387
01:35:11,172 --> 01:35:13,440
上帝啊
Jesus Christ.

1388
01:35:13,442 --> 01:35:15,508
怎么 你难道会跟你的女人说这种话
What? You wouldn't tell your woman?

1389
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:17,177
当然不会
No.

1390
01:35:17,179 --> 01:35:19,179
我啥都不跟我的女人说 但你比我娘多了
No, I don't tell them shit. But you're more
of a Nance than me.

1391
01:35:19,181 --> 01:35:21,081
你要是告诉她 你该怎么说
What'd you say?

1392
01:35:21,083 --> 01:35:23,349
嘿 宝贝 抱歉 我之前为之心碎的那个女人 我以为她死了
"Look, sorry, hon, that girl I was bent out
of shape over for years

1393
01:35:23,351 --> 01:35:25,318
结果她没死 而且她就在迈阿密呢
"she's not dead. She's in Miami.

1394
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:27,854
没啥大不了的
"Don't make a big fucking thing out of it."

1395
01:35:35,062 --> 01:35:36,663
你什么时候走
When you going?

1396
01:35:36,665 --> 01:35:38,665
- 去哪儿
- 别装傻了
- Going where?
- What do you mean, where?

1397
01:35:38,667 --> 01:35:40,967
你发现你心爱的女人还活着 而且只在离你200英里远的地方
You found out this girl you used to be bugs for</i>
<i>is 200 miles away.</i>

1398
01:35:40,969 --> 01:35:42,602
你准备什么时候走
When you going?

1399
01:35:47,441 --> 01:35:49,642
等到和Maso这件事了结 我再做决定
Probably go after this thing with maso.

1400
01:35:49,644 --> 01:35:50,610
好的
Good.

1401
01:35:50,612 --> 01:35:52,946
能让你撑到活着做完这个了结
Give you something to live for.

1402
01:35:52,948 --> 01:35:54,781
你什么意思
What does that mean?

1403
01:35:54,783 --> 01:35:57,751
他和自己的手下塞了半列火车
Him and his guys are taking over half a train
to get down here.

1404
01:35:59,186 --> 01:36:01,788
这可是段声势浩大的旅程
That's a big fucking entourage.

1405
01:36:01,790 --> 01:36:04,491
该死 不用为这事担心
Ah, bullshit. I ain't worried about it.

1406
01:36:04,493 --> 01:36:06,926
他为什么要杀了我们 没道理
There's no percentage in killing us.

1407
01:36:06,928 --> 01:36:10,096
我们光是私酒生意就为他送上一千一百五十万美元
We do 11 and a half million dollars a year from rum alone

1408
01:36:10,098 --> 01:36:12,365
就在这么个小城市
in this fucking cow town.

1409
01:36:12,367 --> 01:36:14,367
他为什么要杀了我们
What's he want to kill us for?

1410
01:36:14,369 --> 01:36:17,203
我们天天给他往 纳罕特的别墅里面送钱
All we do is send him bags of money up to his
mansion in fucking nahant.

1411
01:36:17,205 --> 01:36:18,505
有不祥之兆啊
I don't like the signs.

1412
01:36:18,507 --> 01:36:20,373
- 什么不祥之兆
- 我们没盖成赌场
- What fucking signs?
- We lost the casino.

1413
01:36:20,375 --> 01:36:22,442
毒品生意也没有进展
We never moved on narcotics

1414
01:36:22,444 --> 01:36:24,611
你又是爱尔兰人 这就已经够弱势了
and you're Irish in a world where there ain't much
of a shortage in guineas.

1415
01:36:24,613 --> 01:36:28,248
他几乎包下了整个酒店 每个房间里都有他的人
Okay? You're walking into a building where he
bought up every room.

1416
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:29,783
我连件武器都藏不进去
I can't hide a weapon.Nothing.

1417
01:36:29,785 --> 01:36:32,085
你到时候跟瞎子一样就进去了 我们只能在外面干着急
You're going in blind and we'll be outside.

1418
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:36,790
这些征兆还不够吗
Is that enough signs for you?

1419
01:36:41,662 --> 01:36:44,197
你得帮我个忙
I need you to do something for me.

1420
01:36:44,199 --> 01:36:47,867
我需要你在迈阿密待一段时间
I need you to go stay in Miami for
just a little while.

1421
01:36:50,738 --> 01:36:52,705
一段时间是多长
How long is a little while?

1422
01:36:52,707 --> 01:36:55,375
我也不知道 不会太长
I don't know. Not too long.

1423
01:36:55,377 --> 01:36:58,611
我不能知道你的住处 你把地址交给Dion
I'm not gonna have your address. I want you
to give it to Dion.

1424
01:36:58,613 --> 01:37:00,947
风头过了 他会给我你的地址
When the time comes, he'll tell me where you are

1425
01:37:00,949 --> 01:37:02,415
我再去找你
and I'll come get you.

1426
01:37:04,985 --> 01:37:08,588
这样你就能发现自己到底够不够残忍吗
So you can find out if you are as cruel
as you need to be?

1427
01:37:09,957 --> 01:37:11,558
我猜是的
I guess so.

1428
01:37:13,093 --> 01:37:14,494
Joseph
Joseph.

1429
01:37:15,696 --> 01:37:17,964
就算你赢了今天这场战斗
Even if you win today's battle,

1430
01:37:17,966 --> 01:37:20,733
在你的黑帮江湖中仍然存在各种暴力
there's so much violence in what you do.

1431
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:30,443
过来
Come here.

1432
01:38:34,241 --> 01:38:35,975
Gino 你现在住哪儿
Gino, where you living now?

1433
01:38:35,977 --> 01:38:37,176
尼庞西特
Neponset.

1434
01:38:37,178 --> 01:38:38,778
安顿下来了吗
Oh. Settling down?

1435
01:38:38,780 --> 01:38:42,582
有两个孩子了 有个大家庭了
Two kids. Mugghiera, casa. Whole thing.

1436
01:38:42,584 --> 01:38:43,850
你呢
You got any?

1437
01:38:43,852 --> 01:38:45,652
我还没想过呢
None for me.

1438
01:38:45,654 --> 01:38:48,121
这种事 没有时机合不合适这么一说 
There's never a right time.

1439
01:39:11,545 --> 01:39:12,946
这边来
This way.

1440
01:39:29,563 --> 01:39:31,097
你好吗 我的孩子
How are you, my son?

1441
01:39:32,333 --> 01:39:34,000
很好
Fine.

1442
01:39:34,002 --> 01:39:35,969
Fausto 看看Dion需要点什么
Fausto, see if Dion needs anything.

1443
01:39:50,651 --> 01:39:52,585
你怎么样
So, how've you been?

1444
01:39:52,587 --> 01:39:54,320
挺好的 你呢
Good. You?

1445
01:39:54,322 --> 01:39:56,589
还行 好日子总比坏日子多
More good days than bad.

1446
01:39:56,591 --> 01:39:57,857
那好
Good.

1447
01:40:01,996 --> 01:40:05,131
这就是那个搞砸赌场计划的女人吗
This is the filly who fucked up the whole
casino thing?

1448
01:40:06,467 --> 01:40:08,468
是的 就是她
Yeah, that's her.

1449
01:40:08,470 --> 01:40:11,537
那为什么你没有动手杀了她
Why didn't you clip her then?

1450
01:40:11,539 --> 01:40:13,072
那样的话 引起的回火太大
Too much blowback.

1451
01:40:13,074 --> 01:40:14,640
不是这个原因
That's not it.

1452
01:40:15,609 --> 01:40:17,744
Joseph 你不是一个杀手
You're not a killer, Joseph.

1453
01:40:17,746 --> 01:40:19,812
你只是一个裹在西装里的强盗
You are a bandit in a suit.

1454
01:40:19,814 --> 01:40:21,748
这就是为什么你没有杀死这个——
That's why you didn't kill that

1455
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:23,549
疯婊子
<i> puttana pazza.</i>

1456
01:40:23,551 --> 01:40:25,952
你知道我给你的帮派赚了多少钱吗
You know how much money this place was doing
when I got here?

1457
01:40:25,954 --> 01:40:28,087
- 你知道现在这里是什么情况吗
- 那只是私酒赚的钱
- You know what it's doing now?
- But that's all rum.

1458
01:40:28,089 --> 01:40:30,556
你撒手不管这个女孩 还有毒品 又怎么说
You neglected the girls and the narcotics.

1459
01:40:30,558 --> 01:40:32,658
因为我知道私酒是利润最高的生意
I went after the rum 'cause it was the most profitable

1460
01:40:32,660 --> 01:40:34,560
自从我到这来 我们又新开了四家私酒酿厂
and I added four houses in my time here.

1461
01:40:34,562 --> 01:40:36,362
但是你本可以赚更多的钱的
Yeah, but you could have added more.

1462
01:40:36,364 --> 01:40:37,563
Maso 听着
Maso, look--

1463
01:40:37,565 --> 01:40:39,298
叫我Pescatore先生
Mr. pescatore!

1464
01:40:41,902 --> 01:40:46,239
现在依伯和坦帕都是我的地盘了
你有什么意见吗
I ran ybor. I ran tampa. Did you ever have a problem?

1465
01:40:46,241 --> 01:40:47,440
你的地盘还要更大
You did more than that.

1466
01:40:47,442 --> 01:40:49,442
整个海岸线都是你的了
You ran the whole coast.

1467
01:40:49,444 --> 01:40:54,080
你把Albert White打击到迈阿密某个角落里苟延残喘
You boxed out Albert. Put him in a little
piss corner of Miami.

1468
01:40:54,082 --> 01:40:56,549
我有看账本 知道是怎么回事
I've been through the books.

1469
01:40:56,551 --> 01:40:58,384
你在这里发展了一支不小的力量
You made us a force down here.

1470
01:40:58,386 --> 01:41:01,921
现在呢 既然你的帮派不招爱尔兰人了 我该去哪儿
But now what? "No Irish need apply?"
What can I be?

1471
01:41:01,923 --> 01:41:03,456
我让你去哪儿你就去哪儿 
What I fucking tell you to be.

1472
01:41:03,458 --> 01:41:06,793
不然我打烂你的嘴 蠢货爱尔兰佬
Before you get a fucking pop in the mouth, Mick.

1473
01:41:08,796 --> 01:41:11,864
你可以做参谋
You can be <i> consigliere.</i>

1474
01:41:11,866 --> 01:41:15,802
教Digger一些本领 带他认识认识朋友 
You teach digger the ropes. Meet people.

1475
01:41:15,804 --> 01:41:17,970
教他钓鱼什么的
Teach him to fish.

1476
01:41:17,972 --> 01:41:20,540
不过你该“理发”了
But you need to take a haircut.

1477
01:41:20,542 --> 01:41:22,675
“理发”是什么意思
What kind of a haircut?

1478
01:41:22,677 --> 01:41:24,277
理下来的“发” 你要交给让Digger掌管
Digger gets your take.

1479
01:41:28,415 --> 01:41:31,751
听着 Pescatore先生
Look, Mr. pescatore,

1480
01:41:31,753 --> 01:41:34,020
我觉得这是个很好的主意
I think it's a fabulous idea.

1481
01:41:34,022 --> 01:41:36,622
Digger来这里接管一切
Digger comes down here, takes over.

1482
01:41:36,624 --> 01:41:39,358
然后我们掌控整个佛罗里达 和那些古巴人
We'll run Florida, we'll take over Cuba.

1483
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:41,894
但是我的分成必须基本保持原状
But my take's gotta stay somewhere near where it is.

1484
01:41:41,896 --> 01:41:45,498
如果让我做帮派的小头目 我不可能有现在的权力了
And there's no power in being crew boss and
shaking down longshoremen.

1485
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:48,634
你难道就没看出来 我们就是这个目的吗 聪明佬
You ever think maybe that's the point, smart guy?

1486
01:41:48,636 --> 01:41:51,370
你需要我 我帮你建立了这座帝国
You need me. I built this.

1487
01:41:51,372 --> 01:41:52,705
我们要你还有用
We could use you.

1488
01:41:52,707 --> 01:41:55,108
但是我觉得你应该对我多点感激
But I'm sensing a lack of gratitude.

1489
01:41:55,110 --> 01:41:56,175
我也这么觉得
So am I.

1490
01:41:58,345 --> 01:41:59,912
你为我工作
You work for me.

1491
01:41:59,914 --> 01:42:03,282
并不为跟你整天混在一起的古巴黑人工作
Not the spics or the niggers you hang out with.

1492
01:42:03,284 --> 01:42:07,653
如果我让你帮我清理马桶里的屎 你猜猜 你该怎么做
If I tell you to clean the shit out of my toilet,
guess what you do?

1493
01:42:09,857 --> 01:42:11,891
我可以杀死你的贱货女友
I can kill your cunt girlfriend

1494
01:42:11,893 --> 01:42:15,261
把你的房子烧成灰烬 如果我兴致来了的话
and burn your house to embers if I feel like it.

1495
01:42:16,730 --> 01:42:21,167
所以 你是想做小头目
So, do you want to be crew boss

1496
01:42:21,169 --> 01:42:23,603
还是想帮我冲厕所
or clean the shit out of my toilet?

1497
01:42:23,605 --> 01:42:26,439
当然 如果你两个都想做 也可以
I'm accepting applications for both.

1498
01:42:33,614 --> 01:42:35,314
那就小头目吧
I guess it's crew boss.

1499
01:42:36,683 --> 01:42:38,151
这才是好孩子
That's my boy.

1500
01:42:42,456 --> 01:42:45,424
今天晚上一起吃晚餐吧 这边有几家不错的餐馆
You want dinner tonight? We have a few nice spots
set aside.

1501
01:42:45,426 --> 01:42:49,695
Joseph 你知道我喜欢Albert White什么吗
You know, Joseph, what I like about Albert white?

1502
01:42:50,130 --> 01:42:51,931
什么
What?

1503
01:42:51,933 --> 01:42:54,033
我喜欢他对坦帕也是一样了解
It's that he knows tampa too.

1504
01:42:54,035 --> 01:42:57,203
没人需要你了 傻逼
Which means nobody needs you, dumb fuck.

1505
01:43:11,952 --> 01:43:15,188
我的运气啊 变了很多
My fortunes have changed a little bit.

1506
01:43:16,924 --> 01:43:19,792
我和Maso谈妥了
Me and maso, we patched things up.

1507
01:43:19,794 --> 01:43:24,997
当你把赌场的生意搞砸之后 他来找我帮他儿子
Turns out when you blew the casino deal, he looked
to me to help his son.

1508
01:43:24,999 --> 01:43:27,833
这才是一切的开始啊
And that was just the start.

1509
01:43:29,336 --> 01:43:30,736
看见没
You see,

1510
01:43:34,808 --> 01:43:37,143
你得信任你的合作伙伴啊
you need to trust the people you work with.

1511
01:43:41,014 --> 01:43:44,684
我们加入这个游戏 并不是为了
We don't get into this game to place second.

1512
01:43:44,686 --> 01:43:46,285
当二把手 任人宰割的
To back the wrong horse.

1513
01:43:48,855 --> 01:43:50,122
就是这样
That's it.

1514
01:43:51,959 --> 01:43:56,095
你觉得自己明天能吃顿好饭 看看日落
You thought you'd be eating tomorrow, looking
at the fucking sun?

1515
01:43:58,732 --> 01:44:00,766
再仔细想想
Well, think again.

1516
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:03,703
好好看看周围的一切吧
因为你马上就要看不到了
Take your last look because you die now.

1517
01:44:03,705 --> 01:44:05,171
等等
Wait.

1518
01:44:05,173 --> 01:44:08,107
Albert 我有你想看的东西
Albert, I have something
you wanna see.

1519
01:44:08,109 --> 01:44:11,744
一件不看你会抱憾终身的东西
Something that if you don't see, you'd
regret your whole life.

1520
01:44:11,746 --> 01:44:14,313
让你永远不会原谅自己的东西
You'd never forgive yourself.

1521
01:44:21,488 --> 01:44:22,722
她已经死了
She's dead.

1522
01:44:22,724 --> 01:44:24,290
她看着像死了吗
She look dead to you?

1523
01:44:25,559 --> 01:44:26,826
她在哪儿
Where is she?

1524
01:44:26,828 --> 01:44:29,929
她就在这张他妈的照片上 Albert
She's in the fucking picture, Albert.

1525
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:36,135
- 她到底在哪儿
- 我愿意告诉你 
- Where is she?
I- 'd love to tell ya.

1526
01:44:36,137 --> 01:44:38,271
但是我更想活着走出这里
I'd love to walk outta here more.

1527
01:44:39,339 --> 01:44:40,840
这照片是旧的
That's an old one.

1528
01:44:40,842 --> 01:44:43,042
- 你用旧照片糊弄我
- 我刚开始也这么以为
- You just folded up an old one.
- That's what I thought, too.

1529
01:44:43,044 --> 01:44:45,645
你看 角落里这男人拿的报纸
But, look, that guy in the corner
with the newspaper.

1530
01:44:45,647 --> 01:44:46,912
日期是上个月的
That was last month.

1531
01:44:48,148 --> 01:44:52,018
你告诉我 不然我就把你送进地狱
You tell me, or I'll put you in the fucking ground.

1532
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:53,753
我也爱她 Albert
I loved her, too, Albert.

1533
01:44:53,755 --> 01:44:55,388
像你爱你现在那个女人一样吗
Like you love that woman?

1534
01:44:55,390 --> 01:44:56,689
是的
Yeah.

1535
01:44:56,691 --> 01:44:58,391
她是黑鬼 还是西班牙脏货呢
She a nigger or a spic?

1536
01:44:58,393 --> 01:45:00,092
都是
She's both.

1537
01:45:09,569 --> 01:45:11,103
不 不要
No! No!

1538
01:45:23,850 --> 01:45:25,217
你的人都他妈的是从哪冒出来的
Where the fuck are they?

1539
01:45:25,219 --> 01:45:28,654
去问Albert啊 他不是很了解坦帕吗
Why don't you ask Albert? He knows tampa.

1540
01:45:28,656 --> 01:45:31,857
Maso 你知道所有的私酒
You know why all the molasses and rum
that comes into Florida

1541
01:45:31,859 --> 01:45:33,926
是怎么从坦帕运出去的吗
comes through tampa, maso?

1542
01:45:34,528 --> 01:45:35,661
隧道
The tunnels.

1543
01:45:35,663 --> 01:45:37,096
什么隧道
What tunnels?

1544
01:45:37,098 --> 01:45:39,932
这里的街道下面全是隧道
The ones running underneath this neighborhood.

1545
01:45:39,934 --> 01:45:42,168
他们就是这样运输私酒的
That's how they get the booze in.

1546
01:45:42,170 --> 01:45:45,204
我的手下已经出动了
That's where my men are right now.

1547
01:45:45,206 --> 01:45:49,075
你的人守满了整个前门
Your guys are all standing around guarding the front door.

1548
01:45:49,077 --> 01:45:51,277
但我的人并不会从前门进来
But that ain't where we're coming.

1549
01:45:51,279 --> 01:45:53,346
我们已经冲着你来了
We're coming for you, maso.

1550
01:45:55,582 --> 01:45:58,751
但是我们走的是地下的路
But we're coming from below.

1551
01:47:57,437 --> 01:47:58,504
走啊
Go, go!

1552
01:48:04,978 --> 01:48:06,245
走
Go!

1553
01:48:13,086 --> 01:48:14,220
房间里都没人了吗
You cleared the room?

1554
01:48:14,222 --> 01:48:16,021
是的 整层楼都安全了
Everything. The whole floor.

1555
01:48:16,023 --> 01:48:18,157
Seppe 你再去检查一下
Seppe, give it another look.

1556
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:20,893
老大 有人看见Coughlin在楼下
Boss, they spotted coughlin downstairs.

1557
01:48:20,895 --> 01:48:22,828
他受伤了吗
He even get a scratch?

1558
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:24,497
头上破了一个口子
A cut on the head.

1559
01:48:24,499 --> 01:48:27,500
你们别等着他死 或者败血而亡了吧
I don't suppose you can wait for him to die
of blood poisoning?

1560
01:48:27,502 --> 01:48:30,503
等他死的话 我觉得时间来不及了吧
Well, I don't think we got that kinda time.

1561
01:48:32,305 --> 01:48:34,573
能有你这么蠢的儿子
It's a hard thing for a man

1562
01:48:34,575 --> 01:48:37,776
我活的也是太艰难了
to have a son this stupid.

1563
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:45,251
都安全了 老大
All clear, boss.

1564
01:48:45,253 --> 01:48:49,054
你们把大门守好了 
I want you to cover the door and the stairs

1565
01:48:49,056 --> 01:48:52,525
要牢得像罗马军队百夫长一样
like Roman fucking centurions.

1566
01:49:12,412 --> 01:49:14,280
给我倒一杯吧 好吗
Pour me one, will ya?

1567
01:49:26,660 --> 01:49:28,027
你躲到哪去了
Where were you hiding?

1568
01:49:28,029 --> 01:49:29,762
躲什么
Hiding?

1569
01:49:29,764 --> 01:49:31,764
Seppe检查房间的时候
When seppe cleared the room.

1570
01:49:31,766 --> 01:49:33,499
我就在这里坐着
Sitting right here.

1571
01:49:33,501 --> 01:49:37,636
我问他 愿不愿意为一个明天还能活着的老板工作
I asked him if he wanted to work for someone
who'd be alive tomorrow.

1572
01:49:37,638 --> 01:49:39,305
就这么个条件吗
That's all it took?

1573
01:49:39,307 --> 01:49:42,841
谁让你要把你儿子这样的蠢货带到坦帕来管事
That, and you wanted to put a fucking dunce
like digger in charge.

1574
01:49:42,843 --> 01:49:46,445
我们在这里有多好的生意啊 你只来了一天 就全毁了
We had a good thing going here and you fucked it
all up in one day.

1575
01:49:46,447 --> 01:49:52,651
你知道就因为你这套意大利纯血统的狗屎
让多少人在今天送了命吗
You know how many people died here 'cause of your
simple wop bullshit?

1576
01:49:52,653 --> 01:49:56,655
也许有一天 你也会有自己的儿子
那你就会了解我这么做的原因了
Maybe someday you'll have a son and you'll understand.

1577
01:49:56,657 --> 01:49:58,324
我能了解什么呢
What will I understand?

1578
01:50:00,193 --> 01:50:02,061
我儿子呢
How is my son?

1579
01:50:02,063 --> 01:50:04,396
他已经死了
Your son is dead now.

1580
01:50:59,686 --> 01:51:01,687
他们会要了我们所有人的命
They would have killed every last one of us.

1581
01:51:01,689 --> 01:51:03,3894
会把我们赶尽杀绝 你知道的
Hunted us down. You know that.

1582
01:51:06,126 --> 01:51:09,595
大概他们也没想老死吧
They didn't expect to see old age.

1583
01:51:10,997 --> 01:51:12,398
我也是 没打算活到老
Neither do I.

1584
01:51:16,803 --> 01:51:18,270
杀死Albert之前
I had this whole thing I was gonna say

1585
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:20,272
我准备跟他长篇大论一番的
to Albert before i killed him.

1586
01:51:26,846 --> 01:51:27,913
没来得及说
Too late.

1587
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:36,588
好了
All right.

1588
01:51:36,590 --> 01:51:39,558
今天我不想再看到任何人被杀了 
I don't wanna see anyone else get killed today.

1589
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:41,326
你们有人想死吗
Any of you guys wanna die?

1590
01:51:42,762 --> 01:51:43,829
没有 Coughlin先生
No, Mr. coughlin.

1591
01:51:43,831 --> 01:51:45,197
如果有人想回到波士顿继续过日子

如果有人想留在这里
But if any of you want to stay down here...

1594
01:51:50,237 --> 01:51:53,138
阳光充足女人又漂亮的坦帕

1595

但我不干了
But I'm finished.

1597
01:52:00,081 --> 01:52:02,448
想找老板的话 去找Dion
You want the boss? Go to him.

1598
01:52:02,450 --> 01:52:03,982
现在他掌管一切了
He runs things now.

1599

有什么不明白的地方吗

All right, let's go. Clean up this fucking mess.

1603
01:52:50,931 --> 01:52:53,632
<i>Dion掌管了坦帕的帮派 整整八年
Dion ran the crew for eight years.</i>

1604
01:52:54,367 --> 01:52:56,135
<i>他说得对
And he was right.</i>

1605
01:52:56,137 --> 01:52:58,003
<i>他最终没有活到老
He didn't see old age.</i>

1606
01:53:51,157 --> 01:53:53,292
有什么话赶紧说
Say what you have to say.

1607
01:53:53,294 --> 01:53:54,893
说什么
So, what?

1608
01:53:54,895 --> 01:53:57,563
你遭遇了车祸 然后你就想 我得借机逃走 对吗
You had the wreck, you thought you'd just
make the best of it?

1609
01:53:59,032 --> 01:54:00,098

No.

1610
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:01,466
那该说什么
Then, what?

1611
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:03,902
到底发生了什么事 Emma
What happened, Emma?

1612
01:54:10,643 --> 01:54:12,678
当警察开始追我们的时候
Well, once the coppers started chasing me...

1613
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:14,479
我跟司机说 
I said to the driver, the only way

1614
01:54:14,481 --> 01:54:17,015
逃脱的唯一方法 就是把车开下桥
to get away was to drive off the bridge.

1615
01:54:18,484 --> 01:54:20,085
但他不听我的
But he wouldn't listen.

1616
01:54:20,087 --> 01:54:21,854
所以呢
So?

1617
01:54:21,856 --> 01:54:23,388
所以我就开枪把他打死了
So I shot him.

1618
01:54:24,657 --> 01:54:26,992
我掉进水里 然后游到岸上
We went into the water. I swam out.

1619
01:54:26,994 --> 01:54:30,295
跑到最近的有人的房子里求助
Ran to the nearest house with a light on.

1620
01:54:30,297 --> 01:54:32,731
收留我的是个渔民
He was a fisherman.

1621
01:54:32,733 --> 01:54:35,567
他乐意把我留在身边
Oh, he was happy to take me in.

1622
01:54:35,569 --> 01:54:36,969
你就没想过要找我吗
You didn't wanna reach me?

1623
01:54:36,971 --> 01:54:39,938
如果我稍稍出头 我就会被杀死
If I put my head up, they would've killed me.

1624
01:54:41,007 --> 01:54:42,708
我又不欠你什么
I didn't owe you.

1625
01:54:42,710 --> 01:54:45,177
我为你悼念了这么多年
I mourned you for years.

1626
01:54:45,179 --> 01:54:49,081
你告诉我 我该怎么可怜你呢
Why don't you tell me how bad I'm supposed to feel for ya?

1627
01:54:49,083 --> 01:54:50,883
如果我有一个来自爱尔兰大城市的
Oh, maybe if I had a police chief father

1628
01:54:50,885 --> 01:54:52,451
警督父亲 我可能还能理解你
from a nice part of Ireland...

1629
01:54:52,453 --> 01:54:54,586
但我没有 所以我也没办法
But I just had to make do.

1630
01:54:54,588 --> 01:54:56,588
你有没有爱过我
Did you ever love me?

1631
01:54:57,290 --> 01:54:59,124
我们开心过 Joe
We had a laugh, Joe.

1632
01:55:00,493 --> 01:55:01,894
我们之间有些美好的瞬间
Sure, there were moments.

1633
01:55:01,896 --> 01:55:04,596
但你却要把我们之间的一切认为成我们从未有过的东西
But you had to make it something it wasn't.

1634
01:55:04,598 --> 01:55:06,164
是什么
Which was what?

1635
01:55:06,766 --> 01:55:08,567
谎言
A lie.

1636
01:55:09,769 --> 01:55:12,704
我们并不是上帝的宠儿 
You know we're not god's children.

1637
01:55:12,706 --> 01:55:16,675
也不是真爱童话故事里的主角
We're not fairy tale people in a true love book.

1638
01:55:16,677 --> 01:55:21,780
我们匆忙地舞蹈  这样才能阻止脚下的野草疯长
We dance like motherfuckers so the
grass can't grow underfoot.

1639
01:55:25,251 --> 01:55:29,821
我自由了 Joseph
I'm free, Joseph.

1640
01:55:29,823 --> 01:55:33,592
如果想拜访我的话  你已经得到了我的公开邀请
If you wanna come by now,
you got an open invitation.

1641
01:55:42,869 --> 01:55:45,704
我们总有一些欢乐时光的
We always had a lotta laughs.

1642
01:55:49,809 --> 01:55:51,877
我不想要自由
I don't wanna be free.

1643
01:55:52,345 --> 01:55:53,912
哦 拜托
Oh, come on.

1644
01:55:55,448 --> 01:55:58,050
自由 是我们一直都向往的
That's all we ever wanted.

1645
01:55:58,052 --> 01:55:59,685
那是你向往的
It's what you wanted.

1646
01:56:00,687 --> 01:56:02,120
现在你已经得到了
And now you got it.

1647
01:56:08,227 --> 01:56:09,895
再见 Emma
Goodbye, Emma.

1648
01:56:41,794 --> 01:56:43,695
