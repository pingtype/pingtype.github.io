《此时》
读者见面会
作者
杰西・华莱士

4
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,200
你认为这本书算自传式的吗？
Do you consider the book to be autobiographical?

5
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,700
这个…
Well, I mean...

6
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,710
…什么书不是自传式的呢？
...isn't everything autobiographical?

7
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,340
我们都是通过自己那小小的钥匙孔看外面的世界，对吧？
I mean, we all see the world through our own tiny keyhole, right?

8
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,450
我是说，我总想起汤玛斯・沃尔夫说的
I mean, I always think of Thomas Wolfe.

9
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,180
你看过《天使望故乡》那本书前面那短短一页的“致读者”吗？
Have you ever seen that little one-page " Note to Reader" in the front of Look Homeward, Angel?

10
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,220
你知道我在说什么吧？
Well, you know what I'm talking about?

11
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,930
总之，他说我们的生命就是由点点滴滴集合而成的
Anyway, he says that we are the sum of all the moments of our lives...

12
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,900
…而任何人坐下来，写出来的都不过是自己生命中的体验…
...and that anybody who sits down to write will use the clay of their own life...

13
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,590
…谁都无法回避
...that you can't avoid that.

14
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:37,670
所以当我审视我的人生，我必须得承认，我发现…
So when I look at my own life,you konw I have to admit, right, that I...

15
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,470
我从来没有经历过枪林弹雨或是暴力事件，起码没真正体验过
I've never been around a bunch of guns or violence, you know, not really.

16
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,610
没有什么政治阴谋，也没什么直升机失事
No political intrigue or a helicopter crash, right?

17
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,310
但是我的人生，从我个人观点来看仍然是富有戏剧性的
But my life, from my own point of view,has been full of drama, right?

18
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,420
于是我想也许我也能写本书…
And so I thought,if I could write a book...

19
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,030
…记录下我见到某人时的感觉
...that could capture what it's like to really meet somebody...

20
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,920
我是说，我经历过的最刺激的事情之一
One of the most exciting things that's happened to me...

21
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,400
…就是真正和某人见面，让两个人心灵相通
...is to meet somebody,make that connection.

22
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,630
而如果我能把它表现出来…你明白吗，抓住那一刻的感觉…
And if I could make that valuable,you know, to capture that...

23
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,600
…那就是我的写作意图了，亦或者…
...that would be the attempt, or....

24
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,630
你满意我的回答吗？
Did I answer your question?

25
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,650
我干脆就直说吧…
I'll try to be more specific.

26
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,810
我在火车上遇见一个年轻的法国女郎
Was there ever a French young woman on a train you met...

27
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,320
并和她共度良宵
...and spent an evening with?

28
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,130
这个，对我来说…我是说…
See, to me, that.... I mean...

29
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,730
- …这并不重要，你懂吗？ - 就是说的确有了？
- ...that's not important, you know?  - So that's a yes?

30
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,660
好吧，既然我人在法国，这又是我签名售书的最后一站，那就算有吧
All right, since I'm in France and this is the last stop of my book tour, yes.

31
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,300
谢谢
Thank you.

32
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,870
华莱士先生，这本书的结尾给我们留下了悬念
Mr. Wallace, the book ends on an ambiguous note.

33
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,370
我们不知道
We don't know.

34
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,170
你认为他们六个月之后会重聚吗？
Do you think they get back together in six months...

35
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,810
就像他们彼此承诺的那样？
...Iike they promise each other?

36
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,350
像他们保证的？
Like they promised?

37
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,650
我认为这个问题实际上是，是个…
I think how you answer that,you know, is....

38
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,760
是个很好的测试，看看你到底是喜欢浪漫还是对它嗤之以鼻
It's a good test, right,if you're a romantic or a cynic.

39
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,990
我是说，你认为他们会重聚的，对吧？
Right? I mean, you think they get back together, right?

40
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,690
- 显然你并不这么认为  - 是的
- You don't, for sure.  - No.

41
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,860
还是你希望他们会，不过你无法肯定
And you hope they do,but you're not sure.

42
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,730
- 所以你才问这个问题  - 你认为他们会重聚吗？
- That's why you're asking the question.  - Do you think they get back together?

43
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,070
我是说你们重聚了吗？在现实生活中？
I mean, did you in real life?

44
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,370
现实生活中…？
Did I in real...?

45
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,340
要用我祖父的话来说啊
Look, in the words of my grandfather, okay:

46
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,610
天晓得会不会
"To answer that would take the piss out of the whole thing."

47
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,010
我们的时间只够问最后一个问题了
We just have the time for one last question.

48
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,920
你下一本书将是什么？
What is your next book?

49
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,020
我不知道，老兄，我真的不知道…
I don't know, man. I don't know.

50
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,720
我一直…一直在考虑这个构思…
I've been...I've been thinking about this....

51
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,600
我总是想写本书…
Well, I always kind of wanted to write a book...

52
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,430
…一切都发生在一首流行歌曲那么长时间内
...that all took place within the space of a pop song.

53
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,770
总共大概三到四分钟吧
Like three or four minutes long,the whole thing.

54
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,500
整个故事大概是说有个男人…
The story, the idea,is that there's this guy, right...

55
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,410
…他非常的沮丧，因为…
...and he's totally depressed.

56
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,780
他最大的梦想就是拥有一段轰轰烈烈的爱情，一次冒险…
His great dream was to be a lover,an adventurer, you know...

57
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,720
…比如开着摩托周游南美
...riding motorcycles through South America.

58
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,650
但是事实上他只是坐在大理石桌前吃着龙虾
And instead he's sitting at a marble table eating lobster.

59
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,920
他有份不错的工作，妻子也很漂亮
He's got a good job and a beautiful wife, right, but that...

60
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,460
他应有尽有，但是这并不是他真正想要的…
Everything that he needs.But that doesn't matter...

61
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,640
…因为他真正想要的是为某种理想而战
...because what he wants is to fight for meaning.

62
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,130
你明白吗，快乐来自于过程
You know? Happiness is in the doing, right?

63
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,640
而不是因为你得到了你想要的东西
Not in the getting what you want.

64
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,330
总之，他坐在那里，突然间…
So he's sitting there,and just that second...

65
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,780
…他五岁的小女儿跳上了桌子
...his little 5-year-old daughter hops up on the table.

66
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,250
他知道她该下来，因为她可能会受伤
And he knows that she should get down, because she could get hurt.

67
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:42,150
但是她正穿着夏日的裙子随着那首歌翩翩起舞
But she's dancing to this pop song in a summer dress.

68
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,780
然后一晃眼
And he looks down...

69
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,490
…突然间，他回到了十六岁
...and all of a sudden, he's 16.

70
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:53,790
他的高中女友正送他回家
And his high-school sweetheart is dropping him off at home.

71
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,530
而他们刚刚度过了他们的初夜，她很爱他…
And they just lost their virginity,and she loves him...

72
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,670
…而汽车收音机里里播放着的是同样的一首曲子
...and the same song is playing on the car radio.

73
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,880
然后她爬上了车顶，开始在那里跳舞
And she climbs up and starts dancing on the roof of the car.

74
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,640
这一下，他开始很担心她！
And now he's worried about her.

75
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:11,120
她很美，表情也竟然和她女儿一模一样
And she's beautiful, with a facial expression just like his daughter's.

76
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,620
事实上，这可能就是他为什么会喜欢她的原因
In fact, maybe that's why he even likes her.

77
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,720
你懂吗，他知道他并不是身处回忆之中…
You see, he knows he's not remembering this dance...

78
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,660
…而是他就在那里，他同时出现在人生的两个场景之中
...he's there. He's there,in both moments, simultaneously.

79
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,300
就在这一瞬间，他全部的人生好像都交汇到了一起
And just for an instant,all his life is just folding in on itself.

80
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,200
对他来说，时间明显是个谎言
And it's obvious to him that time is a lie.

81
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,970
因为那一刻将一直延伸下去…
That it's all happening all the time...

82
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,700
…而且每个时刻之内都包含着另一个时刻…
...and inside every moment is another moment...

83
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,810
…一切的一切，都发生在同一瞬间
...all happening simultaneously.

84
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,110
总之，这就是我大概的想法，总之
Anyway, that's kind of the idea.Anyway.

85
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,820
我们的作者很快就得去机场了…
Our author has to be going to the airport soon...

86
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,920
…那么，谢谢各位今天下午光临
...so thank you all very much for coming over this afternoon.

87
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,390
尤其要感谢华莱士先生和我们共度了这么美好的一个下午
And a special thanks to Mr. Wallace for being with us.

88
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,030
谢谢，谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

89
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,890
希望你出下本书的时候我们还能在这见到你！
We hope to see you here again with your next book.

90
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,050
[法语]感谢大家光临
Merci a toutes et a tous qu'etre venus.

91
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,550
[法语]我们为大家准备了香槟和一些小点心
Comme vous voyez y a du champagne,y a des petites choses a gagnoter,

92
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,550
[法语]请尽情享受吧
donc servez vous.

93
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,870
谢谢各位，我必须在几点之前去机场？
Thank you all. How much longer before I have to go to the airport?

94
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,670
哦，你必须在七点半之前离开？
Oh, you should leave at 7:30...

95
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,440
- 最迟七点半！ - 好
- Seven-thirty at the very latest.  - Okay.

96
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,680
- 嗨  - 你好
- Hi.  - Hello.

97
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,020
- 你还好吗？ - 很好，你呢？
- How are you?  - Good, and you?

98
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,590
挺好，是的，我很好，我…
I'm good, yeah, I'm great. I'm....

99
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,730
你愿意…我是说…去喝杯咖啡什么的吗？
Do you wanna, maybe,get a cup of coffee?

100
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,940
他不是说你要赶飞机吗？
Didn't he just say you have a plane to catch?

101
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,910
是啊…不过时间还早
Yeah. But, I mean, I have a little time.

102
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,570
- 那好吧  - 好吗？好，那，让我…
- Okay.  - Yeah? All right, well, let me....

103
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,870
我在外面等你
I'll meet you outside. Okay.

104
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,980
我出去一下，喝杯咖啡
Excuse me. I'm just gonna go get a cup of coffee.

105
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,450
- 我七点一刻回来  - 这些书你都签了名吗？
- I'll be back at 7:15.  - Did you sign all these?

106
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,250
- 是的，我肯定签了  - 拿着你的司机菲利普的名片…
- Yeah, I sure did.  - Get your driver Philippe's card...

107
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,950
…这样你要是晚了，就用手机给他打电话
...so you can call his cell if you're running late.

108
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,750
我们会把你的包放在车里，这样你就不会晚了
We'll put your bags in the car so you're not late.

109
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,490
- 好的，谢谢你  - [法语]非常感谢
- All right, thanks for everything.  - Thank you.

110
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,800
谁是菲利普？
Which one's Philippe?

111
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,450
[法语]菲利普，把你的名片给他，上面有你的手机号码
Philippe, passe lui ta carte pour qu'il forme ta numero portable.

112
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,450
[法语]谢谢
Merci.

113
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,090
- 真难以置信你会在这里  - 我就住在巴黎
- I can't believe you're here.  - I live here in Paris.

114
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,820
你真的不用多呆几天吗？你不用再和谁谈什么了吗？
Are you sure you don't have to stay?You're not supposed to talk more?

115
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,090
不，他们都开始烦我了，我昨晚整夜都在这里
They're sick of me.I spent the night here.

116
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,630
- 哦，真的吗？ - 是啊，他们楼上有间阁楼
- You did?  - Yeah, they got a loft upstairs.

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,370
- 你怎么样？这感觉真奇怪  - 我很好
- How are you? This is so weird.  - I'm fine.

118
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,300
- 见到你真高兴！ - 见到你真高兴！
- It's good to see you.  - It's good to see you.

119
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,110
- 那你想去喝杯咖啡吗？ - 哦，当然
- So you want to go to a cafe?  - Yeah.

120
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,680
那好，那边不远有一家很不错
Okay. There's one a little further that I like.

121
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,750
我刚才见到你的时候我都快傻了
I thought I was gonna totally lose it in there when I first saw you.

122
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,680
你怎么会知道我会来这的呢？
How did you know I was gonna be here?

123
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:03,290
这是我在巴黎最喜欢的书店了，你可以坐在那里看一天书
It's my favorite bookstore in Paris.You can sit down for hours and read.

124
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,450
我很喜欢这样，那儿是有跳蚤，不过，你知道的…
I love it. There's fleas,but, you know....

125
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,990
我知道，我简直感觉昨晚有只猫睡在我头上
I know. I think a cat slept on my head last night.

126
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,790
我一个月前就书店日历上看到你的照片
I saw your picture on the calendar about a month ago...

127
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,830
知道你会来这里
...and that you were going to be here.

128
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,170
有意思的是，我读了你的书，一小段而已
It's funny, because I read an article on your book...

129
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:20,330
- 我有种朦朦胧胧的的亲切感  - 朦朦胧胧？是吗？
- ...and it sounded vaguely familiar.  - Vaguely? Yeah.

130
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,540
是的，只不过是在见到你的照片之后才有的，所以…
But I didn't put it all together until I saw your photo. So....

131
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,870
你看过那书了吗？
Did you have a chance to read it?

132
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,520
是的，我…
Yes, I....

133
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,150
你的书让我感到惊喜，你应该体会得到的
I was really, really surprised,as you can imagine.

134
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,980
我是说，我对它爱不释手
I mean, I had to read it twice, actually.

135
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,210
- 是吗？ - 是的
- Yeah?  - Yeah.

136
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,650
[法语]写得马马虎虎？
Comme ci comme ca?

137
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,250
不，我很喜欢，非常浪漫！
No, I liked it. It's very romantic.

138
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,090
我平时不爱看类似的书，但是你写的真好
I usually don't like that,but it's really well-written.

139
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:46,320
- 写的非常好，祝贺你！ - 好吧，谢谢
- It's well-written. Congratulations.  - All right. Thank you.

140
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,600
- 等等  - 怎么啦？
- Wait.  - What?

141
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,800
在我们出发前，我得问你…
Before we go anywhere,I have to ask you....

142
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,770
没问题，什么事？
Sure. What?

143
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,940
那年十二月，你去维也纳了吗？
Did you show up in Vienna that December?

144
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,180
- 呃，你去了吗？ - 没有，我没能去成，但是…你去了吗？
- Did you?  - No, I couldn't. But did you?

145
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,720
- 我必须要知道，这对我很重要！ - 为什么，既然你都没去？
- I need to know. It's important to me.  - Why, if you didn't?

146
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,080
那，你去了吗？
Well, did you?

147
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,750
没有
No.

148
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,890
哦，谢天谢地你没去！
Thank God you didn't.

149
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,890
- 哦，天啊  - 谢天谢地你没去
- Oh, my God.  - Thank God you didn't.

150
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,590
我是说，幸亏我没去，你也没去，要是我们两个只有一个人去了…
Thank God I didn't and you didn't.If one of us had showed up alone...

151
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,200
- …那简直是糟透了  - 我知道，我知道，我一直担心这个
- ...that would have sucked.  - I was so concerned.

152
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,240
我一直因为没去而内疚，但是我确实没法！我祖母那之前几天过世了
I felt horrible about not being there,but I couldn't. My grandma died...

153
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,710
那天是她下葬的日子，十二月十六日
...and she was buried that day,December 16th.

154
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,470
- 她过世了？就是布达佩斯的那一位？ - 是的，你还记得？
- The one in Budapest?  - Yes. You remember that?

155
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,480
- 当然，我什么都记得  - 噢，对了，你书中还提到了
- I remember everything.  - Of course, it was in your book.

156
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,950
总之，我的确想过去维也纳的
But anyway, I was about to fly to Vienna, you know...

157
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:43,220
但是噩耗突然传来，我只能去参加葬礼了
...and we heard the news about her,and of course I had to go to the funeral.

158
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,120
是啊，听到这个真让人难过
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.

159
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:49,060
我知道，反正你也没去…
I know. But you weren't there anyway.

160
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,760
等等，你为什么没去？
Wait. Why weren't you there?

161
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:55,300
我要是能去的话一定会去的，我定了计划，而且我…
I would have been there if I could have. I made plans....

162
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,730
你最好能找到个好一点的理由！
You better have a good reason.

163
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,270
怎么了？
What?

164
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,810
哦，不！
Oh, no.

165
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,500
你去那了，是吗？
No, you were there, weren't you?

166
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,410
哦，不，真糟糕！
Oh, no, that's terrible!

167
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,310
我知道，我笑了，不过我不是有意的！
I'm laughing, but I don't mean it.

168
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,350
你当时生我气了吧，一定是的
Did you hate me?You must've hated me.

169
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,790
- 你一直都在生我的气吧？一定是的  - 没有
- Have you been hating me all this time?You have.  - No.

170
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,290
- 有，你生我气了  - 没有
- Yes, you have.  - No.

171
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,320
但你现在不生气了，对吧？
But you can't hate me now, right?

172
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,660
- 我是说，我祖母…  - 我没生你的气，又不是什么大事
- I mean, my grandma...  - I don't hate you. It's no big deal.

173
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,420
我大老远飞过去，你却放我的鸽子
I flew all the way over there,you blew the thing off.

174
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,690
于是我的人生自此一蹶不振，不过，这又算什么呢
My life's been a big nosedive since,but it's not a problem.

175
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,770
- 我只是开玩笑，开玩笑  - 别这么说，我真无法相信
- No, I'm kidding.  - Don't say that. I can't believe it.

176
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,440
我一定是把你气疯了，我真抱歉
You must have been so angry with me. I'm so sorry.

177
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,130
我真的很想去的，没什么比这个更重要了！
I really wanted to be there,more than anything in the world.

178
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,040
- 不开玩笑了，我发誓…  - 你不能生气啊，我祖母…
- Honestly, I swear...  - You can't be angry, my grandmother...

179
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:42,880
我懂，我真的想到了，你大概就是被这种事情缠住了
I know. I honestly thought that something like that might have happened.

180
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,140
我确实是非常失望，不过…
I was definitely bummed, but....

181
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,020
我感到最遗憾的还是因为我们没有交换电话号码，或者任何其他个人信息
Mostly I was mad we hadn't exchanged any phone numbers or any information.

182
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,180
瞧瞧我们干的傻事，没法彼此联系
That was so stupid.No way to get in touch.

183
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,690
- 对啊，没法继续下去了  - 我甚至不知道你姓什么
- Nothing to go on.  - I didn't know your last name.

184
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,060
记得吗，我们都担心如果我们开始通信，打电话…
Remember, we were both afraid if we started writing and calling...

185
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,790
- …感觉会不会慢慢的就变淡了  - 是啊，而且肯定不会慢慢变淡
- ...that it would slowly fade out.  - lt definitely wasn't a slow fade.

186
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,200
肯定不会
No, it sure wasn't.

187
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,200
我们都怀念曾经拥有的感觉
We wanted to pick up where we left off.

188
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,740
如果这份感觉可以永存的话，那就再好不过了
Which would have been fine if it had worked. Oh, well.

189
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,640
那么…
So....

190
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,440
- 你在维也纳待了多久？ - 就几天
- How long were you in Vienna, then?  - Just a couple days.

191
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,150
你碰到其他女孩了吗？
Did you meet another girl?

192
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,550
啊，是啊，她叫格蕾岑，她棒极了
Yeah, her name was Gretchen and she was amazing.

193
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,650
- 真的？ - 是啊，事实上，那书是写你们两个的
- You did?  - The book's really a composite of the two of you.

194
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:27,850
- 真的吗？ - 没这回事，我只是开玩笑！你不会相信的，我甚至还回到火车站过
- Really?  - No, I'm kidding. You wouldn't believe... I even went back to the train station.

195
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,160
我支了个牌子，写了我旅馆的电话号码，以免你来晚了找不到
I put up signs of my number in the hotel in case you'd been delayed.

196
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,000
- 我真是个笨蛋  - 我们这边走，有人打电话给你吗？
- I was a total dork.  - Let's go this way. Did you get any calls?

197
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,400
有几个妓女，拉皮条的
Just a couple hookers looking for a gig.

198
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,170
哦，那真是糟，我是说，你指望让我说什么呢
No, it was awful, I mean,what do you want me to say?

199
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,740
哦，太让人伤心了，我真抱歉！
It's so sad. I'm so sorry.

200
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:46,040
我就那么转悠了几天，最后，就飞回去了
I walked around for a couple days.Eventually, I flew home.

201
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,510
还欠了我爸两千块
I owed my dad 2000 bucks...

202
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,710
他可是警告我不要碰法国鸡
...who had warned me about French chicks.

203
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,780
他怎么对你形容法国女人的？
What did he tell you about French women?

204
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,080
没什么，他，他从来没有遇见过法国女人
Nothing. He's never met any French women.

205
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,550
他从来没有去过比密西西比河更东的地方
He's never been east of the Mississippi.

206
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,960
那你干嘛不加上一句，“六个月过去了，那个法国婊子还是没出现”
Why didn't you put, "Six months later,the French bitch didn't show up"?

207
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,720
不，可是我差点这么做了
No, but I did, I did.

208
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,870
- 你真的想过？ - 是的，我是说，我让它看起来更有悬念
- You did?  - Yeah. No. I made it more hopeful.

209
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,590
我写了一段虚构的情节，说你最后出现了
I wrote this fictional version where you do show up.

210
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,270
- 哦，你怎么写的？ - 呃…
- Oh, what happens?  - Well....

211
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,200
怎么了？
What?

212
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,600
呃，我们整整做了十天爱，这还没完
We make love for about 10 days straight,that's one part of it.

213
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,580
- 哦，真有意思，一个法国荡妇…  - 没错
- Interesting. So the French slut, right?  - Yeah, exactly.

214
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,270
从那以后，他们开始了解对方
It's just then they get to know each other better...

215
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,440
然后他们意识到彼此并不合适
...and realize they don't get along at all.

216
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,950
- 我喜欢这样，看起来更真实  - 我的编辑可不这么想
- I like that. It's more real.  - My editor didn't think that way.

217
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,250
谁都想相信爱情，为了畅销嘛，对吧？
Everyone wants to believe in love.It sells.

218
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,420
是啊，就是如此，所以…
Yeah, exactly, so....

219
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,720
就是说你一切都好，对吧？
So things are going well for you,right? I mean....

220
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,130
- 我是说，你的书是美国畅销书…  - 只是本小小的畅销书
- Your book is a bestseller in the U.S.  - It's a tiny bestseller.

221
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,330
- 哦，别谦虚啦…  - 好吧，没错，理论上说，是的
- Oh, come on.  - All right. Officially, yes.

222
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,670
可大多数人连莫比・迪克的书都没读过，又怎么会来读我的？
Most people haven't read Moby Dick.Why should they read my book?

223
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,110
我也没读过莫比・迪克的书，可是我就喜欢你的书，所以…
I haven't read Moby Dick and I liked your book.

224
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,580
- 谢谢  - 即使…
- Thanks.  - Even though...

225
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,540
我觉得你把那一晚描绘得太完美了
...I thought you idealized the night of it.

226
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,450
嘿，我说，这可是小说
Come on, it's officially a fiction, right?

227
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,280
- 我本来就得…  - 我知道，我知道
- I'm supposed to...  - I know, I know.

228
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,680
你知道，有些时候，你让我看起来…
I know. I thought there were times where you made me....

229
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,290
呃，我是说她，不，还是我…算啦，管她是谁
Well, I mean, her, right?No, me. Okay, whatever.

230
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,560
- 总之有点神经质！ - 你确实有点啊，不是吗？
- A little bit neurotic.  - You are a bit like that, aren't you?

231
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:13,000
- 你认为我神经质？ - 没有，这是个玩笑而已！
- You think I'm neurotic?  - No, no, no. Come on, I'm kidding.

232
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:15,030
我哪那么写了，我才没有呢
Where did I do that? I didn't do that.

233
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,930
我这人就是这样的，你知道的…
Oh, maybe it's just me, you know....

234
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:21,130
读到一个故事，知道故事是根据自己来写的
Reading something, knowing the character is storied based on you...

235
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,010
这既让人受宠若惊，也让人心神不宁
...it's both flattering and disturbing at the same time.

236
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,700
怎么会让人心神不宁的？
How is it disturbing?

237
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:30,150
我不知道，只是…成为他人记忆中的一部分
I don't know. Just being part of someone else's memory.

238
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,950
透过你的眼看到我自己
Seeing myself through your eyes.

239
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,520
你写了多久？
How long did it take you to write it?

240
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,290
呃，三四年吧，时断时续的
Three or four years, on and off.

241
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,660
哇，你花了那么长时间就为了写一个晚上发生的事情？
Wow, that's a really long time to be writing about one night.

242
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,530
是啊，我知道，你说的没错
Yeah, I know. Tell you about it.

243
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,300
我总是认为你已经忘记我了
I always assumed you had forgotten me.

244
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,470
没有，我心目中你的印象非常清晰
No, I had a pretty clear picture of you in my mind.

245
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,070
- 我得告诉你件事情，我…  - 怎么了？
- I have to tell you something. I just....  - What?

246
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,620
这么久以来，我一直想和你聊天，你知道吗，而现在…
I've wanted to talk to you for so long that now...

247
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,620
- 是啊，我也是  - 现在梦想成真了
- Me,too.  - It's just surreal, you know?

248
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,550
我却觉得不知道该说什么了
I feel like everything should be...

249
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,620
我懂，我懂，我们还有多长时间？二十分钟又三十秒？
How long do we have?Twenty minutes and 30 seconds?

250
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,120
不，我们有的是时间，我想多和你聊聊
We got more than that.I wanna know about you.

251
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,910
告诉我你在做什么？
Tell me, what are you doing?What are you up to?

252
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,750
呃，从哪开始呢…我为绿十字会工作，那是个环保组织
Where to start? I work for Green Cross.It's an environmental organization.

253
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,330
他们是干嘛的？
What are they all about?

254
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,090
这个嘛，基本上来说，我们会关注一些环境问题
We basically work on different environment issues...

255
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,890
比如净化水质，或者销毁化学武器什么的
...from clean water to disarmament of chemical weapons.

256
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,540
你懂吗，涉及环境的国际法什么的
International laws that deal with the environment.

257
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,070
- 那，你为他们做什么？ - 我们走这边
- What do you do for them?  - We're going this way.

258
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,840
很多事了
Different things.

259
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,910
比如去年，我在印度待了一阵，在一间水处理工厂工作
Like, last year I was in lndia for quite a while,working on a water-treatment plant.

260
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:34,050
那里的棉纺工业是主要的污染源，所以…
Well, the cotton industry there is a major source of pollution, so....

261
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,150
我是说，听起来你的确做了一些有意义的事情
I mean, it sounds like you're actually doing something.

262
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,790
大多数人，也包括我，只是…你知道吗，无所事事
Most people, myself included,just sit around and bitch.

263
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,620
美国消耗了世界上大多数资源，箱式轿车尤其如此
You know, how America's consuming all the world's resources, SUVs suck...

264
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,190
全球也在变暖…
...global warming is real...

265
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,760
很高兴你不是那种狂妄自大的美国人
I'm relieved to hear you're not one of those "freedom fries" Americans.

266
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,370
不过，你是怎么会去做这个的呢？
Hey, you know...But how'd you get into that?

267
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,800
啊，我政治系毕了业，那时我希望为政府工作
I came out of political science,hoping to work for the government.

268
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,740
- 而我确实也替他们干了一阵，哎，太糟了！ - 不好吗？
- And I did for a little while. Terrible.  - Not good?

269
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,570
是的，不好，我们这边走，总之，我烦透了…
Yeah, no. anyway, I got really tired... Let's go this way.

270
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,080
…与朋友无休止的讨论…
Having this endless conversation with friends...

271
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,480
关于世界怎么会分裂成这样的问题
...about how the world was falling to pieces.

272
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,120
所以我意识到我真正想要做的
So I decided what I really wanted to do was...

273
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,690
就是找到一些可以做好的事情，然后努力做好它们
...to find things that could be fixed and try to fix them, you know?

274
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,620
我一直觉得你会做这种超酷的事情的
You know, I always thought you'd be doing something cool like that. I did.

275
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:23,760
谢谢！不过我真的很幸运，能找到份自己喜欢的工作
Thanks. I just feel really, really lucky to be doing a job I like, you know?

276
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,430
是啊
Yeah.

277
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,330
你知道吗，事实上我曾经非常彷徨，一会儿认为这个世界已经没救了…
I actually alternate in between thinking everything is irrevocably screwed up...

278
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,800
一会儿又认为很多时候还是有转机的
...and things might be getting better in ways.

279
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,440
转机？为什么要这么悲观呢？
Better? How could you possibly say that?

280
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,410
这个嘛，我只是说，你明白吗，比如…
Well, I just mean, you know, like....

281
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,240
我知道这听起来很奇怪，不过有些事情还是要从好的方面来看
I know it sounds weird, but there are things to be optimistic about.

282
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:46,150
好啦，我知道你的书畅销，这非常好，我为你感到高兴，不过…
Okay.... I know your book is selling,which is great, I'm very happy for you.

283
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,620
让我告诉你真实的世界，好吗？世界现在是一团糟！
But let me break the news to you:The world is a mess right now.

284
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,320
从西方世界的观点来看来说，世界的确在变好
From a Western view,things are getting a bit better.

285
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:56,120
我们正把工业重心转移到发展中国家，那里我们能获得便宜的劳动力…
We're moving industry to developing nations where we can get cheap labor...

286
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,600
…而不去管任何环保法律，军火工业蓬勃发展
...free of any environmental laws.The weapon industry is booming.

287
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,740
每年有五百万人因为水质污染而死去，而这些本来是可以避免的
Five million people die a year from preventable water disease.

288
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,930
告诉我，这样的世界还不够糟糕吗？我没有生气，我没有生气
How is the world getting better?I'm not angry, I'm not angry.

289
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,230
不过，说吧，我想知道，我很有兴趣！
But come on, I want to know.I'm interested.

290
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,940
好吧，我知道世界上有很多严重的问题
I realize that there are a lot of serious problems in the world.

291
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,380
- 太好了，谢谢你！ - 我的意思是说
- Okay. Thank you.  - I mean, I don't even have...

292
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,980
- 我在亚洲根本找不到出版商出我的书  - 好啦
- ...one publisher in the Asian market.  - Okay. All right.

293
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,620
- 说“住嘴”！ - 怎么啦？住嘴
- Say stop.  - What? Stop.

294
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,690
听我说，我想说的只是更多的人意识到这一点了，人们正在反击！
Look, all I'm saying is there's more awareness. People are gonna fight back.

295
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,850
世界还是有可能变得更好的，因为更多像你这样的人…
The world might be getting better because people like you...

296
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,660
…学会了说出自己的想法
...are educated and speaking out.

297
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,470
最起码的，那些环保问题
Even the very notion of conservation,environmental issues...

298
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:37,040
最近才出现在词典里
...weren't in the vocabulary till fairly recently.

299
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:41,300
而现在他们已经成了规范了，而最后他们都可能被实现
And they're becoming the norm and eventually might be what's expected.

300
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,480
我同意你的看法，但是同时，这也很危险！
I agree with what you're saying,but at the same time it's dangerous.

301
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,310
帝国主义国家会用你这种观点…
An imperialist country can use that kind of thinking...

302
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,640
…来为他们经济上的巧取豪夺找到依据
...to justify their economic greed.

303
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:55,150
你是在针对某一个帝国主义国家吧，法国佬？
Is there any particular imperialist country you have in mind, there, Frenchie?

304
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,520
- 没，没有  - 没有吗？
- No, not really.  - No?

305
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,960
- [法语]晚上好  - [法语]晚上好
- Bonsoir!  - Bonsoir!

306
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:06,420
- 你愿意坐那边吗？ - 当然，这真不错
- So you wanna sit over there?  - Yeah, this is perfect.

307
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,570
哦，哇，可能我想说的只是…
Oh, wow. Maybe what I'm saying is...

308
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,710
…世界的命运就像一个人的命运一样
...the world might be evolving the way a person evolves.

309
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,900
我是说，比如我，我在退步了吗？
Like, I mean, me, for example.Am I getting worse?

310
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,280
我在进步吗？我也不知道！当我更年轻的时候，我也更健康…
Am I improving? I don't know.When I was younger, I was healthier...

311
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,940
…但是我充满了危机感，你懂吗？
...but I was wracked with insecurity,you know?

312
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,680
现在，我变老了，遇到的问题也更复杂了
Now I'm older and my problems are deeper...

313
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,720
但是我也更知道怎么来处理它们了
...but I'm more equipped to handle them.

314
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,620
那么，你碰到什么问题了？
So, what are your problems?

315
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:36,690
现在？没事，我没事，我只是…
Right now I don't have any.I don't, you know? I'm just...

316
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,590
…我真他妈高兴能在这！
...damn happy to be here.

317
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,590
我也一样
Me too.

318
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,870
那，你在巴黎待了多久了？
So how long have you been in Paris?

319
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:49,480
我昨晚才来，十二天之内我跑了十个城市
I got in last night.I've done 10 cities in 12 days.

320
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,040
我累极了，所以我很高兴一切都结束了
I'm wrecked. I'm so glad it's over,you know?

321
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,710
我已经厌倦了这种推销
I'm tired of being a huckster.

322
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,170
- 嗨  - 你好
- Hi.  - Hello.

323
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:55,960
[法语]请问您想要点什么？
Qu'est que je vous sers?

324
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,470
你要点什么？
What do you want?

325
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,710
一杯咖啡…
A cup of coffee.

326
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:03,450
[法语]请给我来一杯咖啡和一片柠檬
Un cafe et un citron presse,s'il vous plait.

327
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,160
天，我爱死这家咖啡馆了，我真希望美国也有这样的地方
God, I love this cafe. I wish they had places like this in the U.S.

328
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,090
是啊，当我住那边的时候，我可想念咖啡馆了
Yeah, I missed cafes when I was living over there.

329
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,170
我是说，我是找到了一些我喜欢的地方，但是那…
I mean, I find a few places I really liked, but there was...

330
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,390
- 你…你在美国呆过？ - 是的，从…九六年到九九年
- You were living in the U.S.?  - Yes, from '96 to '99.

331
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,160
我那时在纽约州立大学上学
I was studying at NYU.

332
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,170
哦，天啊，真难以相信，塞琳！
Oh, God, don't tell me that, Celine.

333
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,440
- 怎么了？ - 没什么，只是…
- What?  - No, it's just...

334
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,340
- 没什么，我是说我…  - 怎么了
- Nothing, I mean, I...  - What?

335
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,920
我从九八年起就住在纽约了，你懂吗，我们那时都在那里！
I've been living in New York since '98.We were there at the same time.

336
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,640
- 纽约？ - 是的
- In New York?  - Yeah.

337
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:36,520
奇怪的是，事实上有几次我想到过可能会遇见你，
That's weird. It actually crossed my mind a few times that I might run into you...

338
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,020
…但是几率太低了，对吧？而且…
...but the odds are so slim, right? So....

339
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,530
我那时都不知道你住哪个城市
I didn't even know what city you were in.

340
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,190
- 你不是住德克萨斯吗？ - 是的，没错，正是如此，我只是…
- Weren't you somewhere in Texas?  - Yeah, yeah, definitely. I just...

341
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:48,930
我在那住了很久，我只是…你明白吗，到纽约换换环境
I was for a long time. I just,you know, wanted to try New York.

342
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,630
那你为什么回来了呢？
What brought you back here?

343
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,830
一是我读完了硕士
I had finished my master's, for one...

344
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,270
再来，我的签证到期了
...and no visa, no more visa.

345
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,850
而且，不算这些，我也开始有点妄想狂了，媒体上那么多的暴力事件
And I was starting to get paranoid.All the violence in the medias:

346
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,280
黑帮啦，谋杀啦…尤其是那连环杀手
Gang violence, murders,especially serial killers....

347
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,550
而最后决定性的原因是…
But the final straw was...

348
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,660
…有天晚上我听到外面消防通道上有些动静
...one night I heard some noise on my fire escape...

349
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,420
于是我打了九一一，最后警察终于来了
...so I called 911,and the cops came eventually.

350
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,120
- 大概三小时以后吧  - 是啊，那时候我已经被先奸后杀了
- Like three hours later.  - Yeah, after I had been raped and killed.

351
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,220
没有啦，来的只是一个男一女两个警察
No, but it was a man and a woman officer.

352
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,460
当那个女警到楼下挪警车的时候
I was explaining what I had heard...

353
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,970
我向他解释我听到的声音
...when the woman had to go move the police car.

354
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,840
那时只有那个男警察和我一起
I was left alone with the male cop.

355
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:32,470
而他立刻问我是不是有枪…我说没有，我当然没有了
Right away he asked me if I had a gun,and I said, "No, of course not."

356
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,550
然后他对我说：“是吗，你最好考虑去买一把”
And he told me, "Well, you better think about getting one.

357
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,080
“这里是美国，不是法国”
This is america, not France. Okay? "

358
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,380
然后我对他说，我完全不懂怎么开枪
And I said to him, "l have no idea how to shoot a gun...

359
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,080
而且，我对枪支也没有兴趣
...and I have no interest in firearms whatsoever."

360
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,090
于是他抽出他的枪，就像这样，然后他说：
And that's when he pulled out his gun,like this, and he went:

361
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:54,770
“总有一天，你会碰到这么个东西指着你的脸”
"Well, one day, you're gonna have something like this in your face...

362
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,370
“如果你想活的长久点”
...and if you wanna have a long life...

363
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,740
“你就必须决定是不是要干掉他们”
...you're gonna have to choose between you or them."

364
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,210
然后他们就走了，而第二天早上，我就打电话申请持有枪支
And then they left. And the next morning I called for an application to get a gun.

365
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,910
让我拿把枪！我是说，那可真可怕…
Me with a gun.I mean, that's really scary.

366
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,250
但是然后我意识到有些事不对劲
But then I realized something was wrong.

367
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:16,010
那警察拔枪的举动，还有其他的事…
The way that cop had pulled his gun out,and everything, right?

368
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,060
于是我取消了对枪的预订
So I canceled my demand for the gun...

369
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:21,350
然后我打电话给警察局，想要对那个警察的行为进行申诉，但是…
...and I called the police and tried to complain about that cop.

370
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,090
- 发生什么事了？ - 要填太多表了
- What happened with that?  - It was so much paperwork...

371
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:27,100
然后我就怕了，就凭我这种学生签证…
...and then I got scared,with my shitty student visa...

372
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,700
- 你认为你会被遣送出境  - 没错！于是我放弃了…
- Thought you'd get deported?  - Exactly. I gave up...

373
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,630
然后就忘记了整件事
...and forgot about the whole thing.

374
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:35,430
- 其实，我想我永远也不会忘记的  - 当然了
- Well, I guess I never forgot.  - Obviously.

375
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,200
但是，我真的还是喜欢在那里的日子
But still, you know,I really enjoyed being there.

376
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,540
- 我怀念美国的很多事  - 是吗，比如？
- There's lots of things I miss in the U.S.  - Yeah? Like what?

377
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,080
嗯…
Well....

378
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,780
那里的人们通常都有好心情
The overall good mood people have there.

379
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,080
比如，你知道的，即使有的时候胡乱问候
Like, even if it can be bullshit sometimes.

380
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,060
比如“你好吗？”“很好！”“你好吗？”“很好！”
Like, "How you doing? " "Great." "How you doing? " "Great!"

381
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,590
“祝你今天愉快！”
"Have a great day!"

382
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:59,630
我也不知道，巴黎人的脾气可不好，你发现了吗？
I don't know. Parisians can be so grumpy. Have you noticed?

383
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,460
没有啊，每个人在我看来都很高兴啊
No, everybody seems pretty happy to me.

384
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:06,110
- 他们总是不高兴…  - 他们总是不高兴？
- They're not happy. No.  - They're not happy?

385
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:09,640
不是，他们也高兴，我不知道，我说的只是法国男人，他们快把我逼疯了！
No, they are. I don't know. I just mean French men. They drive me nuts.

386
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,240
怎么回事？他们怎么了？
What is it? What about them?

387
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,570
嗯，他们很好，不深入接触的话非常好
Well, they're very nice.They're great, you know, to be around.

388
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,770
他们喜欢食物，酒，他们做东西很好吃…
They love food, wine,they're great cooks.

389
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,940
但是，不知道，可能我只是运气不好
But I've had really bad luck with them.

390
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,750
怎么这么说？什么意思？
Why? What do you mean?

391
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,580
- 我想他们不是那么…  - 怎么？
- Well, I guess they're not as...  - What?

392
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,350
怎么说呢
What's the word?

393
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,690
- 好色？他们不那么好色…  - 好色？
- Horny? They're not as horny.  - Horny?

394
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:35,200
等等，听我这么说怎样，对此，我以身为美国人而骄傲
Wait, listen to me on this one. In that regard, I am proud to be an american.

395
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,910
你确实应该如此，仅对此一点
And you should be.In that regard only.

396
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,450
[法语]谢谢
Merci.

397
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,460
你去过东欧吗？
Have you ever spent time in Eastern Europe?

398
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,430
东欧？没，没有…谢谢
Eastern... No, I don't.Thank you.

399
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,040
我记得当我十多岁的时候我去过华沙
I remember as a teenager I went to Warsaw...

400
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,780
那时它还是共产主义的那一套
...when it was still a strict communist regime.

401
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,350
- 对此我是一点也不支持  - 当然…
- Which I don't approve of at all.  - Sure you don't.

402
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,560
- 不是，我才没有…  - 好啦，我只是开玩笑！
- No, I don't.  - I'm just kidding.

403
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,660
但是，不管怎样，我发现待在那里是件很有意思的事
But anyway, something about being there was very interesting.

404
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:01,060
仅仅几个星期之后，我就有了改变
After a couple of weeks,something changed in me.

405
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:04,390
那座城市又阴郁又灰暗…
The city was quite gloomy and gray...

406
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,330
但是过了一阵以后，我头脑变的更清醒了
...but after a while,my brain seemed clearer.

407
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,160
我在日记上记录了更多的东西
I was writing more in my journal...

408
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:12,530
- 很多我以前从来没有过的想法  - 共产主义的想法？
- ...ideas I'd never thought of before...  - Communist ideas?

409
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,900
- 听着，我可不是…  - 对不起，我…
- Listen, I'm not...  - I'm sorry, I...

410
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,870
- 好吧  - 继续！
- Okay.  - Go on.

411
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:19,670
以后我要送你去俄国古拉格集中营
Okay. I'll send you to a gulag later.

412
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:23,310
只是，那花了我好一阵时间，才搞清楚为什么那里让人感觉那么不同
No. But it took me a while to figure out why I felt so different.

413
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:26,150
然后有一天，当我穿过一个犹太墓地的时候
One day, as I was walking through the Jewish cemetery...

414
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,220
我没想通为什么，但是我真的有所改变
...I don't know why,but it occurred to me there...

415
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:32,260
我意识到过去的两个星期中，我改掉了以前的大多数习惯
...I realized that I had spent the last two weeks away from most of my habits.

416
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,420
电视里说的是我听不懂的语言
TV was in a language I didn't understand...

417
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,360
没什么好买的，也没什么广告
...there was nothing to buy,no advertisements anywhere...

418
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,160
所以，我能做的只有…
...so all I'd been doing was...

419
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:44,070
到处逛，思考，然后写下来，我的大脑好像在休息
...walk around, think, and write.My brain felt like it was at rest...

420
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:47,870
没有了那种强烈的情绪，就好像是自然的高潮一样
...free from the consuming frenzy.It was almost like a natural high.

421
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,640
我感觉内心格外平和，没有什么奇怪的冲动要去什么地方
I felt so peaceful inside.No strange urge to be somewhere else...

422
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,180
购物什么的
...to shop....

423
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,510
一开始这样可能看起来很无聊
It could have seemed like boredom at first...

424
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,450
但是很快这就让人感到内心非常非常的充实
...but it became very, very soulful.

425
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,010
非常有意思，你知道吗？
It was interesting, you know?

426
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,520
你能相信我们上一次漫步在维也纳是九年前的事吗？
Can you believe it was nine years ago we were walking around Vienna?

427
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:08,720
- 九年？真难以想象  - 对我来说就好像是两个月之前的事
- Nine years? No, that's impossible.  - No, it was. It feels like two months.

428
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,860
但是那是九四年夏天了
But it was summer '94.

429
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,370
我看起来有什么不同吗？
Do I look any different?

430
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,670
有？
I do?

431
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,700
我得看你一丝不挂的样子才知道
I'd have to see you naked.

432
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,040
- 什么？ - 对不起…
- What?  - I know, I'm sorry.

433
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,610
你的发型变了，那时…
Your hair was different back then.It was like...

434
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,210
- 什么，一样的啊…  - 把头发放下来，让我看看！
- It's the same... Oh, down.  - Yeah, take it down.

435
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,110
放下来，好吧，放下来了
Down. Okay, it was down. Okay.

436
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,480
好了
Well? Voila.

437
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,240
怎么样？
So?

438
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:38,450
快点，告诉我
Okay, come on. Tell me.

439
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,320
瘦了，我觉得，苗条了
Skinnier, I think. A little thinner.

440
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,920
你觉得我以前很胖？
Did you think I was fat before?

441
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,070
- 不是  - 你肯定觉得我那时很胖
- No....  - Yeah, you thought I was a fatty.

442
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:54,300
没错，你觉得我很胖，你的书写的是个法国胖妞！
No, you thought I was a fatty. You wrote a book about a fat French girl.

443
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,410
- 哦，不要！ - 好啦，说真的
- No, listen.  - Oh, no.

444
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,740
你看起来漂亮极了！
Seriously, all right? You look beautiful.

445
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,940
那你觉得我有什么变化吗？
Do I look any different?

446
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,810
没有什么…哦，事实上你这多了道皱纹
No. Not at all.Actually, you have this line.

447
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,450
- 我知道  - 看起来好像疤
- I know.  - It's like a scar.

448
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:12,090
- 疤？看起来像被枪打得吧？ - 没有，没有，我挺喜欢的，对不起啦
- A scar? Like a gunshot wound?  - No, no, no. I like it. I'm sorry.

449
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:18,230
有天我做了个有趣的…呃，不，恐怖的梦
I had this funny... Well, horrible dream the other day.

450
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:23,290
我做恶梦，梦见我有三十二岁了
I was having this awful nightmare that I was 32.

451
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:26,670
然后当我醒来的时候，我才只有二十三！我就放心了…
And then I woke up,and I was 23. So relieved.

452
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:29,470
但是后来我真的从梦里醒来，发现我确实三十二了
And then I woke up for real,and I was 32.

453
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,150
- 好可怕！ - 是会有这种事的
- Shit, man. It happens.  - Scary.

454
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,010
时间越走越快，看上去，是因为…
Time goes faster and faster.Apparently, it's because...

455
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,640
从二十岁以后我们身体里的神经键就不再更新了，于是，从那以后我们就开始走下坡路了
...we don't renew synapses after our 20s, so it's downhill from then on.

456
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,810
我喜欢变老，你懂吗，会感觉生活更…
I like getting older, you know?Life feels....

457
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,650
我不知道，好像感觉更直接，好像我能欣赏更多东西了
I don't know, it feels more immediate. Like I can appreciate things more.

458
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:50,120
其实我也一样，我很喜欢
No, me too, actually. I really love it.

459
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,360
我曾经是…
I was once...

460
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,970
一个乐队里的鼓手
...a drummer in a band.

461
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,760
- 真的？ - 是啊，我们当时真的很棒
- You were?  - Yeah. We were pretty good, actually.

462
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:01,170
不过那个主唱，他整天就想着让我们能出唱片
But the lead-singer guy, he was just so obsessed with us getting a record deal.

463
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,310
我们整天谈的，想的，就是参加更大的演出
It's all we talked about, thought about,getting bigger shows.

464
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:08,000
每时每刻都是为了将来的发展，而现在…
Everything was just focused on the future all the time. And now...

465
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,050
…乐队却已经不存在了
...the band doesn't even exist anymore.

466
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,580
现在回顾那些我们参加了的表演
And looking back at the shows we did play...

467
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,690
甚至哪怕只是排练，都觉得那么有意思！
...even rehearsing, it was just so much fun.

468
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:20,060
现在我终于能享受那每一分钟了，我能抽一口吗？
I just... Now I'd enjoy every minute of it.Could I have a drag of that?

469
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,350
你的书出版了，这事不算小了
Well, your book has been published.That's a pretty big deal.

470
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,830
而且你巡回了整个欧洲来卖它，你觉得能享受其中的每一分钟吗？
You've been all around Europe.Are you enjoying every minute of it?

471
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,400
- 不太行…  - 不太行？
- Not really.  - Not really?

472
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,000
不行
No.

473
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,200
- 你还有烟吗？ - 当然有
- Do you have another one of those?  - Yes, of course.

474
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,840
给你
Here.

475
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,840
在我这行里，我见到很多人…哦，对不起…
In my field, I see these people that... Oh, sorry.

476
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,580
过于理想，好高骛远
Come into it with big,idealist visions...

477
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,520
想要成为新的领袖，来创建更美好的世界
...of becoming the new leader that will create a better world.

478
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,880
他们乐于见到目标被实现，却对过程没兴趣！
They enjoy the goal,but not the process.

479
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,960
- 是  - 但事实上…
- Right.  - But the reality of it is...

480
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:55,560
真正能改善世界的工作，是日复一日的点滴进步
...the true work of improving things is in the little achievements.

481
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,730
- 这才是应该享受的事  - 你具体指什么呢？
- That's what you need to enjoy.  - What do you mean, exactly?

482
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:02,530
比如，我为一个组织工作，这个组织在墨西哥帮助那里的村民
I was working for this organization that helped villages in Mexico.

483
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,700
他们关心的是怎么把铅笔
And their concerns was how to get the pencils...

484
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:08,270
送到那些乡村小学的孩子手中
...sent to the kid in those little country schools.

485
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,280
那不是什么重大的革命性的想法，仅仅是铅笔而已！
It was not about big,revolutionary ideas. It was about pencils.

486
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:16,110
我见到过那些做实事的人，很不幸的是…
I see the people that do the real work,and what's really sad is that...

487
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,040
…那些最慷慨的，最勤劳的…
...the people that are the most giving, hardworking...

488
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,420
…也是最能让这个世界变得更好的人…
...and capable of making this world better...

489
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,750
…往往没什么野心，不想成为什么领袖
...usually don't have the ego and ambition to be a leader.

490
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,590
他们对那些形式上的奖励没有兴趣
They don't see any interest in superficial rewards.

491
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,860
他们也不在乎自己的名字能不能上报纸
They don't care if their name ever appear in the press.

492
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,860
他们只是享受着帮助人的那种过程
They actually enjoy the process of helping others.

493
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,760
- 他们自得其乐  - 是啊，不过那很难啊！
- They're in the moment.  - Yeah, but that's so hard...

494
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,840
自得其乐，我是说，我感觉我好像…
...you know, to be in the moment.I mean, I feel like I'm...

495
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:44,000
是被设计成那种对什么都不很满意的类型…
...designed to be slightly dissatisfied with everything, you know?

496
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,670
你懂吗，我是说，好像永远都在试图改善自己的现状一样
It's like always trying to better my situation.

497
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:50,350
我满足了一种欲望，就会刺激另一种欲望，懂吗？
I satisfy one desire,and it just agitates another.

498
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,080
然后我就想：都去他妈的吧，欲望是生活的动力
And then I think, to hell with it, right?Desire's the fuel of life.

499
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,090
你认为这是真的吗？
You know? Do you think it's true...

500
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:00,190
如果我们没有欲望，我们就会永远快乐？
...that if we never wanted anything,we'd never be unhappy?

501
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:05,460
我不知道，没有欲望，这难道不是抑郁症的一种表现吗？
I don't know. Not wanting anything,isn't that a symptom of depression?

502
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:09,260
没错，就是的，对吧？我是说，有欲望是种健康的表现，对吧？
Yeah, that is, right?I mean, it's healthy to desire, right?

503
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:13,100
是啊，我不知道，不过那些佛教徒都那么说，对吧？
Yeah. I don't know. It's what all those Buddhist guys say, right?

504
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,670
从欲望中解脱出来，你就会发现…
Liberate yourself from desire,and you'll find...

505
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,040
- 你已经拥有你需要的一切  - 是啊，不过当我想要拥有…
- ...you already have everything you need.  - But I feel alive...

506
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,040
那些不算基本生存需要的东西的时候，我能感觉到自己是真实存活的
...when I want something more than basic survival needs.

507
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,050
我是说，不管哪种欲望，比如想和谁亲热
Wanting, whether it's intimacy with another person...

508
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,020
或是想要双新鞋，都很美…
...or a pair of shoes, is beautiful.

509
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,780
我喜欢我们拥有无止境的欲望
I like that we have those ever-renewing desires, you know?

510
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,690
也许那是一种有权享用的感觉
Maybe it's this sense of entitlement.

511
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:36,660
你懂吗，好像什么时候你觉得你配穿双新鞋
You know, like whenever you feel like you deserve that new pair of shoes?

512
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,730
欲望本身不是坏事，只要你不要太在意得失就好
It's okay to want things, as long as you aren't pissed off if you don't get them.

513
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,800
生活很辛苦，这也是顺理成章的事
Life's hard. It's supposed to be.

514
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
吃一堑，长一智，对吗？
If we didn't suffer, we wouldn't learn a thing, you know?

515
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,310
那，你是佛教徒吗？
So, what, are you Buddhist,or something?

516
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,010
- 不是  - 不是？为什么不是？
- No.  - No? Why not?

517
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:58,180
我不知道，出于同一原因，我不会让自己完全相信任何信仰
I don't know. The same reason I don't really consider myself anything, really.

518
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:01,990
很久前我就决定，我可以接受任何信念…
I decided a long time ago that I was gonna be open to everything...

519
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,680
但是不会执迷于一种信仰
...but not buy into any one and only belief system.

520
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,460
数年前，我曾经去过一所苦修派修道院
I went to this Trappist monastery a couple years ago.

521
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:13,900
- 苦修派？ - 是的，天主教西多教派的
- Trappist?  - Yeah, they're Catholic. Cistercian.

522
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:17,760
- 你为什么要去那  - 为什么？可能就是去读些书吧
- Why did you do that?  - Why? I'd been doing some reading.

523
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:21,840
我觉得那很酷，你曾经和修士和修女生活在一起过吗？
Thought it'd be cool. Have you ever spent any time with monks or nuns?

524
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,510
- 没有，我可不想那样  - 没有？
- No. It's not really my style.  - No?

525
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,340
我本来以为他们都是神情肃穆、严厉苛刻的，但是他们不是
Well, I expected them to be all glowering and stern, but they weren't.

526
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,110
他们很容易就笑，非常好相处
They were quick to laugh,really easy to be around.

527
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,350
真的，他们对一切都不排斥，他们只是…
Seriously, very attuned to everything,they were just...

528
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:39,030
你懂吗，他们不会打扰任何人
You know, they weren't trying to hustle anybody.

529
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,720
他们只是想平静的信奉天主、生存，然后死去
They're trying to live and die in peace with God...

530
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:44,420
也或者他们信奉的是其他什么他们觉得永恒的东西
...or whatever part of them they feel is eternal.

531
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,600
但是身处其间真的很舒服
It was just so refreshing to be around.

532
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,260
你懂吗，你会发现你遇到的绝大多数人
You realize that most of the people that you meet...

533
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,230
都是想要过的更好
...are trying to get somewhere better.

534
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:54,600
赚更多的钱啦，赢得更多的尊敬啊，
They're trying to make more cash,get a little more respect...

535
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:57,240
让人们崇拜自己啊之类的，太累了！
...have more people admire them.It's exhausting.

536
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,570
- 没错  - 要是你自己也成为这样的人，真是太累了
- No kidding.  - And it's exhausting to be one yourself.

537
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:04,150
我是说，我就是这样的，精神上很贪婪
There I am, right, you know,all greedy to be more spiritual.

538
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,910
我想变得更好，懂吗，这是你逃不脱的！
"I want to be a better person,"you know? You can't escape.

539
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:14,260
好多年前，我有个男友想做佛教徒
I had this boyfriend of mine many years ago that wanted to be a Buddhist.

540
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,150
然后他去了亚洲，去瞻仰那里的寺院
So he went to Asia to visit some of those monasteries.

541
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,100
- 是啊，我也想过去那些地方  - 那你应该去，我告诉你为什么
- I've thought about doing that too.  - Yeah, you should. I'll tell you why.

542
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,670
啊，他长得很帅，每次他去那些寺院的时候
He was good-looking, and each time he went to one of the monasteries...

543
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,470
都会有僧侣愿意替他口交
...a monk offered to suck his cock.

544
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,400
真的
True story.

545
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,780
好吧，最后都会变成这样，对吧？
It all comes down to that, doesn't it?

546
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,140
我是说，这就是为什么我很崇拜你做的事
That's why I really admire what you're doing.

547
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,480
- 你知道吗？ - 你什么意思，口交？
- You know?  - What do you mean? Sucking cock?

548
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:40,850
- 啊，不…  - 不是？我猜错了？
- No.  - No? Wrong answer.

549
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:44,820
不是，我想说的是，你不是那种超然的人
No, I was gonna say you're not detached from life.

550
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,460
你做事很有激情
You're putting your passion into action.

551
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,320
这个嘛，起码我努力这样做
Well, I'll try.

552
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:54,330
你知道吗，我接下来八个小时会在机场
You know something?I'm gonna be on planes...

553
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,830
以及飞机上度过
...and in an airport for the next eight hours....

554
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,440
我很想再看看巴黎
I'd just love to see a little bit more of Paris.

555
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,170
- 我们能出去走走…  - 好啊，好啊，我们走吧！
- Would you walk with me?  - Yeah.

556
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,670
- 你介意吗？ - 怎么会呢，很好啊！
- Do you mind?  - That's great.

557
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,810
- 你想去吗？ - 当然！
- Do you want to?  - Let's do that. Yeah.

558
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,840
我们该付多少？四块五…
What do we owe here?Four-fifty?

559
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,610
不用，不用，我有，我有
No, I got it, I got a little per diem going on here.

560
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,010
- 这够付小费的了吗？ - 嗯，够了
- This good, for a tip?  - Yeah, that's fine.

561
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,590
- 只多不少！ - 这个也留下吧
- That's more than enough.  - Throw that in too.

562
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,310
- 好啦，周围有什么值得逛的吗？ - 今天是减价日！
- Is there anywhere to go around here?  - It's sales day today.

563
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:21,460
- 什么意思？ - 今天巴黎什么东西都会减价
- What's that?  - It's when everything's "en solde" in Paris.

564
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,020
每年两次
It's twice a year.

565
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,550
[法语]再见，谢谢
Au revoir!Merci!

566
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,850
[法语]再见
Au revoir!

567
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,530
好啊，那我们去购物吧！
All right, let's go shopping.

568
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,830
不，不，这主意不好，我不想让你这样
No, no, no. That's a bad idea.I don't wanna inflict that on you.

569
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,970
那简直疯了，我们就去那个花园逛逛吧，那真的不错的
It's madness. Let's just go to this garden path. It's really nice.

570
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,710
好啊，听起来其实比购物要好
All right. That sounds better than shopping, actually.

571
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,010
我是说，我并不是不想陪你做你喜欢的事
Not that I wouldn't do whatever you wanted.

572
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:43,170
其实有的时候我也不是需要什么东西
Sometimes I don't even need to buy anything. I just get high...

573
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,150
我只是想试穿，还有看那些商品，这让我很兴奋
...on trying on and looking at things.

574
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,080
这个嘛，苦修派僧侣会对你说…我们往这边走？
Is this where we're going?

575
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,520
- 是的！ - 苦修派僧侣会对你说这很好
- Yeah.  - A therapist will tell you that's good.

576
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,060
- 真的？你节食过吗？ - 没有！
- Really? Are you ever in therapy?  - Oh, no.

577
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,320
- 我看起来像在节食吗？ - 我只是开玩笑
- Do I seem like I'm in therapy?  - I'm kidding.

578
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:59,560
- 这对你的性障碍有帮助吗？ - 我的性障碍？
- Does it help your sex problems?  - My sex problems?

579
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,260
- 没有啦，我只是开玩笑  - 比如呢？跟我说实话
- I'm kidding.  - Tell me the truth.

580
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,730
- 那天晚上我们不是挺好的？ - 不，我是在开玩笑
- We didn't have any problems.  - No, I'm kidding.

581
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,410
- 我们根本就没有做爱  - 这是个玩笑，对吧？
- We didn't even have sex.  - That's a joke, right?

582
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,270
不是，我们确实没做爱！就是这么回事
No, we didn't.I mean, that was the whole thing.

583
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,500
- 可我们确实做了啊！- 没有，没有，我们没做！
- Of course we did.  - No, no, no, we didn't.

584
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:14,510
你没有安全套，而我没有安全套从来不做爱
You didn't have a condom and I never have sex without one.

585
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,580
尤其是一夜情那种，我是说，我对于自己的健康非常在意，我不可能…
I'm extremely paranoid.There's no way...

586
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,340
我觉得这太可怕了，你竟然不记得我们之间发生过什么
I find it scary that you don't remember what happened.

587
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,890
不，听我说
No, listen...

588
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,750
…我从来没写过一整本书，但是我记日记…
...I didn't write an entire book,but I kept a journal...

589
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,010
我在里面记下了整晚发生的事
...and I wrote the whole night in it.

590
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,880
这就是我的意思，你对那夜进行了理想化的加工！
That's what I meant, you idealizing it in night.

591
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,360
好啦，听我说！我甚至记得我们用过的安全套是什么牌子的
All right, listen, I even remember what brand of condom we used.

592
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,430
好啦，这太恶心啦，我不想听！
That's disgusting.I don't wanna hear it.

593
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,160
- 这有什么恶心的…  - 没有啦
- That's not disgusting.  - No.

594
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,900
好啦，等我回家，我会查我九四年的日记，不过我知道我是对的！
Okay, when I get home I'll check my journal from '94, but I know I'm right.

595
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,710
- 等等…  - 怎么了？
- Wait a minute.  - What?

596
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,610
- 那是在一个墓地发生的吗？ - 不是…
- Was it in the cemetery?  - No.

597
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,220
不是的，我们是下午去那个墓地的
No, we went to the cemetery in the afternoon.

598
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,290
应该是在一个公园里，深夜时分
It was in the park, very late at night.

599
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,820
- 在公园里！ - 等等…
- In the park?  - Wait a minute, wait a minute.

600
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,820
我真不能…我没法…
I can't... I can't....

601
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,060
这事这么容易忘记吗？你真的不记得了？在公园里！
Is it that forgettable? You really don't remember? In the park?

602
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:06,100
好的，等等，我想你可能是对的…
Okay. Wait a minute,I think you might be right...

603
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,630
行啦，你在和我胡扯是不是
You're messing with me now.

604
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,230
- 没有  - 你在和我胡扯吗？
- No.  - Are you messing with me?

605
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,600
不是的，对不起！我觉得你…我是说，你是对的，这样可以了吧？
Okay. No, I'm sorry. I think... I mean, you're right, okay?

606
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:16,270
有时我就是忘事
Sometimes I put things in drawers inside my head and forget about it.

607
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,140
我想有时忘记会让人少些痛苦！
It's less painful to put things away than live with it.

608
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:22,080
什么，就是说那夜对你来说是段很难过的回忆罗？
What, so that night was, like,a sad memory for you?

609
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,110
不，我不是针对那一夜
I didn't mean that night in particular.

610
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:26,340
我只是说有些事情还是忘了好
I meant certain things are better forgotten.

611
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,080
那夜是我那一整年记的最清楚的一天
I remember that night better than I do entire years.

612
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:31,090
- 我也是  - 真的吗？
- Me too.  - Really?

613
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,420
呃，我觉得我是…
Well, I thought I did.

614
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:39,690
不过，可能我…可能我忘记那事是因为…
But maybe I... Maybe I put it away because of the fact that...

615
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:43,000
…我祖母葬礼的那天，就是我们约好再见的那天
...my grandmother's funeral was the day we were supposed to meet.

616
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,170
对我来说那天挺难熬，不过对你来说大概更糟
It was a tough day for me,but it must've been worse for you.

617
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:50,970
感觉好像不真实，我还记得我看见她的遗体躺在棺材里
It was unreal. I remember looking at her dead body in the coffin...

618
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:55,510
她曾经总是用她美丽的手抱着我，那么温暖，那么亲切…
...at her beautiful hands, so warm,so sweet, that used to hold me...

619
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:59,320
但是棺材里的她，和我记忆中的一点都不一样
...but nothing in that coffin resembled what I remembered of her.

620
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,050
所有的温暖都消逝了
All the warmth was gone.

621
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,120
然后我开始哭…我感觉很困惑，不知道
And then I was crying,so confused if I was crying...

622
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:09,850
我哭是因为不能再见到她了，还是因为不能再见到你了
...because I was never gonna see her again or never gonna see you again....

623
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,900
对不起，我竟然变成这样，这个星期我情绪都有点低落，我不知道…
I'm sorry. I'm sorry to go on like this.I've been a little down this week.

624
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:17,130
- 为什么？ - 我不知道，没什么，只是…
- Why?  - I don't know. Nothing bad, just....

625
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,310
可能是因为读了你的书？
Reading your book, maybe?

626
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:23,340
也不是，不过…想想那个夏天和秋天，我充满了希望
No, but... Thinking of how hopeful I was that summer and fall...

627
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,770
而自从那以后，好像就有点…
...and since then it's been kind of a....

628
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,750
我也不知道
I don't know.

629
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,080
回忆本来是非常美好的，只要你能让过去的都过去
Memory is a wonderful thing if you don't have to deal with the past.

630
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,660
回忆本来是非常美好的，只要你能让过去的都过去
"Memory is wonderful if you don't have to deal with the past."

631
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,490
我能把这话贴到我车牌上吗？
Can I put that on a bumper sticker?

632
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,360
你知道吗？要是你写一本关于我们的一夜情的书，这是个不错的书名！
If you wrote a book about our night,that's a good title.

633
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:46,400
- 可能会是本完全不同的书  - 是啊，不会涉及色情
- And it could be a total different book.  - Yeah, there'd be no sex scenes.

634
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,330
- 不过你知道吗？ - 嗯？
- But you know what?  - What?

635
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,900
既然现在我们又见面了
Now that we've met again...

636
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,730
我们可以改变我们那个十二月十六日的回忆
...we can change our memory of that December 16.

637
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:56,340
那回忆将不再有是以悲剧结尾了，因为我们又见面了
It no longer has that sad ending of us never seeing each other again.

638
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:01,000
没错，我想回忆永远可以更改，只要你还活着…
Right. I mean, I guess a memory's never finished as long as you're alive.

639
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:04,810
是啊，我知道，我有一段童年的回忆
Yeah, I know. I have this memory from my childhood...

640
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,580
- 但是我最近意识到，这段回忆其实从未发生过  - 是什么？
- ...I realized recently never happened.  - What?

641
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,720
这个，当我八九岁的时候，我妈妈很担心
Well, when I was 8 or 9,my mom was so paranoid...

642
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,760
…怕我上完钢琴课以后，一个人走回家会出事…
...when I was walking home from my piano lesson at night...

643
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:16,620
…她总是让我当心色迷迷的的老头给我糖果…
...she'd warn me about dirty old men giving me candies...

644
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,630
…然后给我看他们的鸡鸡
...and then showing me their pee-pees.

645
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:21,890
她总是这么说，然后后来，你懂吗，我…
She was so obsessed with it that,later in life, you know...

646
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:25,470
…我头脑中就真的觉得这曾经发生过！
...I had this image in my head that this really happened.

647
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,200
我甚至把做爱和回家联系到一起了
To the point that I even associated sex with that walk home.

648
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,070
我是说，有时候，甚至是现在，当我…
I mean, and sometimes,even now, when I'm....

649
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:37,910
当我做爱的时候，我都好像看见我自己在那街上走
When I'm having sex, I see myself walking down that street.

650
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,990
我发誓！非常奇怪，对吧？
I swear. It's so weird, right?

651
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:44,390
- 呃，那条街离这近吗？我是说，能…  - 不行
- ls that street nearby? I mean, could...?  - Could we? No.

652
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,750
非常远
Very far.

653
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:50,450
你小的时候记日记吗？
Did you ever keep a journal when you were a kid?

654
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:53,960
嗯，算是吧，有时记
Yeah. On and off, I guess.

655
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:56,300
很有意思的是，我有天读了…
It's funny, I read one of mine...

656
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,370
- 我八三年的一本日记  - 怎么了
- ...from '83 the other day.  - Yeah?

657
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,330
让我惊奇的是
And what really surprised me is...

658
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:03,440
我那时的人生观和现在一样
...that I was dealing with life the same way I am now.

659
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,640
当然我那时更天真，更充满希望
I was much more hopeful and naive...

660
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:10,110
…不过内心深处对事情的感觉是完全一样的！
...but the core, and the way I was feeling things, is exactly the same.

661
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,620
这让我意识到我其实没怎么变
It made me realize I haven't changed much at all.

662
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,280
是啊，谁不是这样的呢？
I don't think anybody does.

663
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:18,260
尽管人们都不愿意承认，但事实上我们…我们很多个性都是天生的
People don't want to admit it, but it's like we have these innate set points...

664
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:22,020
很少有什么后天发生的事能改变我们的性情
...and nothing much that happens to us changes our disposition.

665
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,660
- 你是这么想的？ - 是的
- You believe that?  - I think so.

666
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:27,160
我曾经读过一些研究报告，是关于那些赢了彩票的人…
I read this study where they followed people who'd won the lottery...

667
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,200
…和截瘫的人的心态
...and people who'd become paraplegics.

668
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,530
你会认为前一件事能让你欣喜若狂，后一件则让你简直想自杀
You'd think one extreme is gonna make you euphoric and the other suicidal.

669
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:36,440
但是研究却表明，大概六个月之后
But the study shows that,after about six months...

670
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:39,880
只要人们习惯了他们的新处境
...as soon as people had gotten used to their new situation...

671
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,380
- 他们就和以前差不多一样了  - 一样？
- ...they were, more or less, the same.  - The same?

672
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:45,780
嗯，是的，如果他们本质上是乐观开朗的人
Yeah. Like, if they were basically an optimistic, jovial person...

673
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:48,790
即使他们现在坐在了轮椅上，他们还是乐天派
...they're now an optimistic, jovial person in a wheelchair.

674
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,960
如果他们是见识短浅的笨家伙
If they're a petty, miserable asshole...

675
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:55,060
就算他们有了卡迪拉克轿车、大房子、游艇，他们还是见识短浅的笨蛋
...they're a petty, miserable asshole with a new Cadillac, a house and a boat.

676
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:58,560
就是说，哪怕有再多的幸运降临，他们还是难以得到满足？
So I'll be forever depressed no matter what great things happen?

677
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,130
- 没错！ - 好吧
- Definitely.  - Great.

678
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,000
别开玩笑了，你现在郁闷吗？
No, come on, are you depressed now?

679
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,470
不，不，我不郁闷
No, no, I'm not depressed.

680
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,300
不过有的时候我会担心，当我走到生命尽头的时候…
But sometimes I worry I'll get to the end of my life...

681
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:11,000
- …我会发现我想要做的事还没都做过  - 哦，那你想要做什么？
- ...feeling I haven't done all I wanted to.  - Well, what do you want to do?

682
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,870
我…
I....

683
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:16,070
我想画更多的画，我想每天弹吉他
I want to paint more,I want to play my guitar every day.

684
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:19,480
我想学中文，我想写更多的歌…
I want to learn Chinese.I want to write more songs.

685
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:23,990
我想做的事太多了，但是最后却只干了没多少
There's so many things I want to do,and I end up doing not much.

686
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:30,730
好吧，那，让我问你这个问题：你相信，嗯，比如鬼或者灵魂什么的吗？
All right, well, let me ask you this:Do you believe in ghosts or spirits?

687
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,260
呃，不信
No.

688
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,760
- 不信？ - 不信
- No?  - No.

689
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:37,700
- 好，那投胎呢？ - 一点不信
- Okay, what about reincarnation?  - Not at all.

690
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,840
- 上帝呢？ - 不信
- God?  - No.

691
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:42,500
- 好吧  - 听起来挺惨的吧
- All right.  - That sounds terrible. No, no, no.

692
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,580
不过，同时呢，我不想变成那种不相信任何魔力的人
But I don't want to be one of those people that don't believe in any magic.

693
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,680
- 你相信占星术  - 没错！
- So then, astrology?  - Yes, of course!

694
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,680
- 总算找到一样了  - 我是说，这很有道理，对吧？
- There we go.  - That makes sense, right?

695
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:54,250
你是天蝎，我是射手，所以我们合得来
You're a Scorpio,I'm a Sag, we get along.

696
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,020
没有啦
No, no, no.

697
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:00,220
爱因斯坦说过一段话，我真的很喜欢
There's an Einstein quote I really, really like.

698
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:03,890
他说：“如果你不相信任何魔法和神话的话
He said, "lf you don't believe in any kind of magic or mystery...

699
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,900
- 那你就和死人差不多了”  - 是啊，我也喜欢这话
- ...you're basically as good as dead."  - Yeah, I like that.

700
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:10,400
我总是觉得茫茫宇宙中有些神秘的和谐
I've always felt there was some kind of mystical core to the universe.

701
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:15,770
最近我在想有关我啊，我的性格之类的
But, more recently, I've started to think that, me, my personality, whatever...

702
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:19,040
我不能永远待在这里
That I don't have any permanent place here, you know.

703
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,870
我们不会长生不老
In eternity or whatever, you know.

704
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:24,880
我越想到这个，就越觉得不能浪费人生
And the more I think that, I can't go through life saying this is no big deal.

705
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:28,540
因为生命仅此一次，任何事情，不管是有趣的
This is it. This is actually happening.What do you think is interesting?

706
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,880
还是好笑的，或者是重要的
What do you think is funny?What is important?

707
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,390
懂吗，每天都有可能是我们的最后一天
You know, every day's our last.

708
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,250
我一想到这个，我就会打电话给我的妈妈说我有多爱她
When I feel that way, I usually call my mom to tell her I love her.

709
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,060
- 是吗  - 然后她就总问
- Yeah?  - And she's always:

710
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:43,330
“你还好吧”“你不会得了癌症吧？你会去自杀吗？”
"Are you okay? Do you have cancer?Are you gonna commit suicide? "

711
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,130
不至于吧
It's almost not worth it.

712
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,140
那我们呢
So, what about us?

713
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:52,840
- 我们？ - 我是说
- What about us?  - No, what I mean is...

714
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:56,610
- 如果我们今晚就要死了  - 你是说世界末日来临？
- ...if we were both going to die tonight...  - Like the apocalypse was coming?

715
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,910
不，没有那么恐怖，不过，如果只有我们两个要死了
No, that's too dramatic... But what if just the two of us were going to die?

716
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,020
我们还会谈论你的书吗？
I mean, would we talk about your book?

717
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,950
- 或者环境问题吗？ - 如果今天是我们的最后一天？
- The environment? Or....  - If today was our last day?

718
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,750
没错，我们会谈什么，你会跟我说什么？
Yeah, what would we talk about?What would you tell me?

719
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,450
- 嗯  - 很难回答？
- Well....  - That's hard, huh?

720
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,960
- 不不，我在想呢  - 好吧
- No, no, I'll do it.  - Okay.

721
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,600
我一定不会再讨论我的书了
I definitely would stop talking about my book.

722
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,430
- 我得承认我大概也不会谈环境问题了  - 好
- I would probably drop the environment.  - Okay.

723
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,540
不过我仍然想要谈谈，那些魔法啊，宇宙什么的
But I would still want to talk about, you know, the magic in the universe.

724
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:24,940
- 只是我希望做这些的时候我是在一个…．  - 什么？
- I'd just want to do it from a...  - What?

725
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,700
…一个旅馆房间里…
...a hotel room, you know...

726
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,680
…在我们每个疯狂做爱的间隙，直到我们死去
...in between sessions of us wildly fucking until we die.

727
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:33,680
哇！何必要浪费时间去旅馆呢？
Wow. Well, why waste time with an hotel room?

728
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:37,290
为什么不在这儿？在这张长椅上？
Why not do it right there on a bench?

729
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:40,390
- 不  - 来，过来
- No.  - Come here, come here, come here.

730
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,990
好啦，我们不会今晚就死的
Okay. We're not gonna die tonight.

731
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,190
好吧，我太激动了，对不起
All right. Too bad. I'm sorry.

732
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,890
我举的只是一个极端的例子
That was an extreme example.

733
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,540
- 对不起  - 没事
- I'm sorry.  - Okay.

734
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,360
我想要说的是…
What I... My point was, you know...

735
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,370
我很难和别人深层次地沟通
...to truly communicate with people is very hard to do.

736
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,340
我懂，不像日常的交流…
No, I know, most of our day-to-day exchanges...

737
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,040
我知道，我是说…
Yeah, no, I mean...

738
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:01,840
- 不要把什么都跟性扯上关系  - 为什么不呢？
- ...not to bring everything back to sex...  - But why not?

739
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,140
不，举个例子来说吧，我的一个女朋友
No, this example, this friend of mine, she was talking about...

740
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,350
- 她曾和我说起她跟她男朋友在床上的问题  - 然后呢
- She and her boyfriend... Problems in bed.  - Right.

741
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,050
她说他们交往一年之后，她开始告诉他…
And how when they had been dating for a year she started telling him...

742
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:15,220
…怎样才能让她获得更多的快感，而这让她男友非常生气！
...what he could do to please her more,and it freaked him out.

743
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,730
- 为什么？ - 他很生气
- Why?  - Totally.

744
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,920
他觉得这是说自己做得不好
He thought it meant he was a bad lover....

745
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:21,000
也许她不该等这么久才说
Maybe she shouldn't have waited so long.

746
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,530
- 你知道，一年以后…  - 没错，不过男人也太容易被激怒了！
- After a year....  - But men are so easily offended.

747
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,200
- 你觉得比女人还容易？ - 当然了，在这一点上毫无疑问！
- What, more than women?  - Definitely on that subject.

748
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,740
- 你这么觉得？ - 没错
- You think so?  - Yeah, yeah.

749
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,600
也许这是因为
Well, maybe it's because, you know...

750
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:34,840
- 男人比较容易获得满足  - 获得满足？
- ...men are easier to... To please.  - To please?

751
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:38,040
- 我不知道  - 没错，他们绝对是的
- Well, I don't know.  - Yeah, they are. They're definitely.

752
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,380
总之我的朋友对我说
Anyway, this friend,she was telling me...

753
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:44,220
…下次她再交男朋友她会给他做一个问卷…
...next time she dates a man,she's gonna make a little questionnaire...

754
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:47,850
- 问明什么是他们喜欢的和不喜欢的  - 你是说写下来还是大声问？
- ...about what they like and dislike...  - What, written down, or out loud?

755
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,760
当然是写下来
Yeah, mostly written down.

756
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:53,590
不过答案不仅仅是“是”或“否”，应该要更详细一点
But it wouldn't be just yes or no.It would be a bit more complex than that.

757
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:57,260
打个比方，如果问题是“你喜欢性虐待吗？”
Like, for example, if the question is:"Are you into S & M? "

758
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,270
答案可以是“不，但是偶尔为之也不错”
The answer could be: "No, but a good spanking once in a while doesn't hurt."

759
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,140
- 怎么样？ - 好，或者是“你喜欢在做爱时讲一些激发情欲的话吗？”
- What about?  - Right, or like:"Do you like talking dirty in bed? "

760
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:09,770
- 类似这种问题？ - 对，不过不只是这么泛泛的
- That kind of thing?  - Yeah, but not just like any dirty talk.

761
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,320
要说：“你喜欢听什么样的词”？
Just "What specific word would you like to hear? "

762
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:13,820
- 你是问我吗？ - 嗯，是啊
- What, me?  - Well, yeah.

763
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:16,650
比如你喜欢听什么样的话？
For example what specific word would you like to hear?

764
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,450
我不知道
I don't know.

765
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,490
你觉得“小蜜桃”这词怎样？
What do you feel about the word "pussy"?

766
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,460
我很喜欢
I love it.

767
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,490
很好
Good.

768
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,670
没想到九年之后我们都变得这么现实了
It's amazing what perverts we've become in the past nine years.

769
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,140
至少我们现不用把每次新的性体验…
At least now we don't have to pretend each new sexual experience...

770
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,000
…都当作是是改变我们人生的大事
...is, like, a life-altering event.

771
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:39,670
我知道，你已经有过了那么多次感情经历，现在都快失去激情了
I know. By now, you've stuck it in so many places it's about to fall off.

772
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:43,580
我也没指望你会一直想着我
And I can't realistically expect you've become anything but a total ho.

773
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:47,150
- 哦，谢谢  - 不，我很抱[歉]…
- Yeah, thank you.  - No, I'm s...

774
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,750
- 没错阿，你该怎样呢？ - 我该…
- That's true. What can you do?  - What can you do?

775
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:54,690
对了，你平时都写些什么歌？我还不知道你会写歌呢
So, what kind of songs do you write?I didn't know you did that.

776
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,090
- 什么类型的？ - 是啊
- What kind?  - Yeah, sure.

777
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,920
- 我不知道，只是歌而已  - 比如
- I don't know, just songs.  - Like?

778
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,760
比如有些是有关人的
Like, some are about,you know, people.

779
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,600
嗯，或是各种爱恨情仇…还有一首是写我的猫猫的！
Relationships. One's about my cat.

780
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,260
- 唱首听听！ - 不行，我没有吉他
- Sing one.  - No, I can't. I don't have a guitar.

781
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,000
- 来吧，清唱一首  - 不行，不行
- Come on. A cappella.  - No, no, no.

782
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:10,340
没有吉他伴奏我唱不了歌，你太过分了！
I'm not singing a song without a guitar.You're nuts.

783
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,780
为什么？
Why not?

784
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,380
- 好吧，至少不是现在  - 就一首
- No, okay. Not now. No.  - One.

785
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:18,810
如果不是现在，还有什么时候呢？你想六个月后在这儿见面吗？带着吉他？
If not now, when? You want to meet here in six months with a guitar?

786
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:20,480
我会飞过来的
I'll fly all the way over here.

787
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:23,650
- 但你不一定能赶上地铁  - 好啦，这不好笑
- You may or may not make the Metro.  - Okay, that's funny.

788
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,120
- 我们该回书店了！ - 没事的
- We've got to get back.  - We'll be all right.

789
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:28,280
- 你会错过你的航班的，快点！ - 好吧
- You're gonna miss your flight.  - All right.

790
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,290
我们可以沿塞纳河走走，很漂亮的
We can walk down La Seine.It's nice.

791
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,020
好吧
Okay.

792
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:36,330
- 那你是要飞回纽约吗？ - 是的
- So you're flying back to New York?  - Yeah, yeah.

793
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:42,160
我在文章中读到你结婚了，还有了一个孩子，真是太好了！
So I read in that article that you're married with a kid. That's great.

794
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,830
没错，他已经…他已经四岁了
Yeah, he's... He's 4.

795
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:47,210
- 他叫什么？ - 亨利，小汉克
- What's his name?  - Henry. Little Hank.

796
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,180
- 他很可爱  - 当然了
- He's so much fun.  - Oh, wow, I'm sure.

797
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:53,320
- 你的太太呢？她是做什么的？ - 她在小学教书
- Your wife, what does she do?  - She teaches elementary school.

798
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:56,410
- 你有孩子吗？ - 是的，有两个。糟了！
- Do you have kids?  - Yes, two... Shit!

799
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:58,060
- 怎么了？ - 我把他们落在车上了！
- What?  - I left them in the car!

800
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:00,890
窗关得死死的，快有六个月了…他们会有事吗？
With the windows up, six months ago!Think they're okay?

801
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,690
没有啦，我开玩笑的，不过我很想要小孩
No, I'm kidding.No, but I want to have kids someday.

802
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,730
- 只是还没做好准备  - 没有吗？
- I'm just not ready yet.  - No?

803
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,060
- 不过我现在正在认真谈恋爱  - 噢是吗？这很好啊
- I'm in a good relationship, though.  - Oh yeah? That's good.

804
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,330
- 他是做什么的？ - 他是个摄影记者
- What's he do?  - He's a photojournalist.

805
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:13,340
专门做战地新闻
He does war coverage.

806
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:16,070
他经常出差，不过从某种角度对我来说，是一件好事，因为我实在是太忙了
He's away a lot, which is good because I'm so busy.

807
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,340
不过那不是很危险吗？我是说，不是有很多人在战争中丧生吗？
But isn't that dangerous? Aren't a lot of those guys getting killed these days?

808
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:23,750
他向我保证不会太冒险的，不过我还是会经常担心
He promises me he doesn't take risks,but I often worry.

809
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,440
他一拿起相机就什么都不顾了
He goes in this trance when he photographs something.

810
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:29,950
- 什么意思？ - 有一次我们在新德里
- What do you mean?  - Well, once we were in New Delhi...

811
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,610
见到一个流浪汉，他躺在人行道上
...and we passed a bum on the...

812
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:34,060
- 炸弹？[谐音]  - 流浪汉！无家可归的人
- A bomb?  - A bum. A homeless.

813
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:35,560
哦，流浪汉
All right, right.

814
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:39,560
总之他看起来需要帮助，但是我男朋友的第一个反应就是拿起相机！
He looked like he needed help, but his first reaction was to photograph him.

815
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:42,570
他凑到离那个人的脸非常近的地方整理他的衣领，让他看起来显得更精神
He went really close to his face,fixing his collar...

816
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,470
他似乎完全不在乎那个人
...totally detached from the person.

817
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,400
不过要做好工作不就得这样吗？
But don't you have to be like that to be good at that job?

818
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:48,910
是啊，我知道啊，我不是…
Yeah, I mean, I'm not....

819
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:52,200
我不是由此来看他的为人，他的工作是重要的也是高尚的
I'm not judging him.What he does is essential and incredible.

820
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,470
我只是说这是我自己永远做不到的
All I'm saying is that I could never do it.

821
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:56,410
我们上那船吧！快！
Let's get on that boat. Come on.

822
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,910
- 不！ - 快，很有趣的！
- No!  - Come on, it'll be fun.

823
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:00,420
- 你没时间了！我们得走了  - 它就要开了
- You don't have time!  - They're about to take off.

824
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:02,990
我还有十五分钟呢，你有手机吗？
I've got 15 more minutes.Do you have a cell phone?

825
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,490
- 有  - 那就好，我有那个司机的号码
- Yeah.  - All right, I've got that driver's number.

826
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,820
我可以打电话给他，让他在下一站停船的地方接我们
I can call him to pick us up at the next stop.

827
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:11,900
好吧，可我从来没上过那船，这是给游客的，太丢脸了
I've never been on those boats.It's for tourists, it's embarrassing.

828
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:13,400
好啦，没事的
Okay. All right.

829
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:16,550
- [法语]唔，我们可以上船了吗？ - 当然
- Uhm, c'est bon?Pouvons-nous entrer?  - Bien sur!

830
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:19,250
- [法语]请给我两张票！ - 不，让我来，让我来
- Deux tickets, s'il vous plait!  - No, I'll get it, I'll get it.

831
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:21,850
- [法语]不，不，还是我来吧  - 好吧，好吧，好吧
- No, no, c'est bon.  - All right. All right, all right.

832
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:25,350
- [法语]下一站停在哪里？ - [法语]亨利四世码头
- C'est ou qu'il s'arrete au prochain arret?  - C'est au Quai Henry IV.

833
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,640
谢谢
Thank you.

834
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,970
- 那你现在是跟他沉浸在爱河里咯？ - 谁？
- So are you in love with that guy?  - What guy?

835
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,480
- 那个战地摄影师  - 哦，当然！
- The war photographer.  - Yes, of course.

836
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:36,250
- [法语]你们可以进去了  - 谢谢
- Vous pouvez y aller.  - Merci.

837
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:38,480
对不起，你的手机…
So do you have that cell phone?

838
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,420
哦，对
Oh, yeah.

839
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:42,430
- 好，让我看看他的号码…  - 好
- Okay, let's see....  - Okay.

840
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,930
我该怎么跟他说呢？
What do I tell him?

841
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,290
让他在亨利四世码头等着
Tell him to pick you up at Quai Henri Quatre.

842
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:49,260
哦，见鬼，什么码头？
Oh, shit. Quai...?

843
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,200
亨利四世，亨利四世码头
Henri Quatre. Quai Henri Quatre.

844
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:54,430
亨利四世
Henri Quatre.

845
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:57,600
你怎么了？不对，你要我来说吗？亨利四世
What's wrong with you? No, do you want me to...? Henri Quatre.

846
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,140
- 亨利四世？ - 没错！
- Henry Four?  - Yes!

847
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:02,300
- 那你为什么不直接说？ - 对不起！
- Come on, why didn't you say so?  - I'm sorry. Okay.

848
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,360
你好，是菲利普吗？
Yeah, is this Philippe?

849
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:19,190
菲利普，我是杰西・华莱士
Yeah. Philippe, this is Jesse Wallace.

850
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:20,730
对
Yeah.

851
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:25,170
呃，听我说，我现在在一条游船上
Well, listen, I'm on one of those boats, right?

852
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:28,240
我们将会在亨利四世码头下船
And we're gonna arrive at Henry Four.

853
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,810
亨利四号码头，你知道在哪儿吗？
At Port Henry Four.You know what that is?

854
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,470
很好，你带着我的行李吧？
All right, great.And you have my bags, right?

855
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:37,580
我们再过…总之下一站就到了
Yeah, so we'll be there in... I don't know, it's the next stop.

856
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:40,150
好，再见
Okay. Au revoir.

857
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,690
- 安排好了？ - 嗯
- It's okay?  - Yeah, yeah.

858
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,830
哇！
Oh, wow.

859
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:48,690
- 看这边啊，巴黎圣母院！ - 哇
- Notre Dame, man. Check that out.  - Oh, wow.

860
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:52,860
我听过一个故事，说的是占领巴黎的德军
I heard this story once about when the Germans were occupying Paris...

861
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:54,660
…撤出的时候
...and they had to retreat back.

862
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,770
他们在巴黎圣母院埋了很多炸药
They wired Notre Dame to blow...

863
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:01,200
…但他们得留一个人来按爆破的按钮
...but they had to leave one guy in charge of hitting the switch.

864
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:04,430
但那个人，那个士兵，他却下不了手！
And the guy, the soldier,he couldn't do it.

865
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:08,340
他只是呆呆地坐着，惊叹这地方的美妙
He just sat there, knocked out by how beautiful the place was.

866
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,380
当盟军部队到达的时候
Then, when the Allied troops came in...

867
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:14,040
他们发现炸药还在那里，但按钮没人碰过
...they found all the explosives lying there and the switch unturned...

868
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:17,880
同样的情景还发生在圣心堂，埃菲尔铁塔…
...and they found the same thing at the Sacre-Coeur, Eiffel Tower...

869
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,360
…很多地方
...couple other places, I think.

870
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:22,460
这是真的吗？
Is that true?

871
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:25,720
我不知道，不过我一直很喜欢这个故事
I don't know.I always liked the story, though.

872
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,260
没错，很震撼的一个故事
Yeah, that's a great story.

873
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,370
你相信巴黎圣母院有一天会消失吗？
But you have to think that Notre Dame will be gone one day.

874
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:33,700
这里曾经是另一座教堂，就在这
There used to be another church at the Seine, right there.

875
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:36,710
- 什么，同一个地方？ - 是的
- What, right in the same spot?  - Yeah.

876
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,610
这样好舒服，我从来没有试过！
You know, this is great.I've never done this.

877
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:43,410
- 是啊  - 我已经忘了巴黎有多美
- Yeah.  - I forget about how beautiful Paris is.

878
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:45,210
其实当个游客也不错
It's not so bad, being a tourist.

879
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:47,880
- 谢谢你带我上这船  - 不用客气
- Thanks for getting me on the boat.  - You're welcome.

880
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:50,960
我觉得我在写那本书的时候，就好像在造什么东西
I think that book that I wrote was like building something...

881
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:55,620
以免我忘记我们经历过点点滴滴
...so that I wouldn't forget the details of the time that we spent together.

882
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:59,600
你懂吗，就好像一个备忘录，告诉我我们的确见过面
You know, like, just as a reminder,that once, we really did meet.

883
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:02,740
你懂吗，那是真的，真的发生过
You know, that this was real,this happened.

884
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,890
我很高兴你这么说，因为…
I'm happy you're saying that,because....

885
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:09,340
我是说，我觉得自己很没用，因为我从来不能这么洒脱
I mean, I always feel like a freak because I'm never able to move on like this:

886
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,780
人们只是随意留情，甚至即使是认真的感情
People just have an affair,or even entire relationships...

887
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,350
…人们也会分手，然后忘记
...they break up and they forget.

888
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:20,420
就像换另一个牌子的麦片一样简单
They move on like they would have changed brand of cereals.

889
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:24,290
可我觉得我永远忘不了跟我交往过的每一个人
I feel I was never able to forget anyone I've been with...

890
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:30,020
…因为他们每个人都有很不一样的特质
...because each person had their own specific qualities.

891
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:35,070
你不能取代任何人，失去的就失去了
You can never replace anyone.What is lost is lost.

892
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,370
每段感情结束的时候我都很受伤，我从来没有完全恢复过
Each relationship, when it ends,really damages me. I never fully recover.

893
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:43,700
所以我尽量避免介入感情
That's why I'm very careful with getting involved...

894
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,940
…因为那种痛真的是太深了！
...because it hurts too much.

895
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:49,280
即使是做爱！其实我不喜欢那样
Even getting laid,I actually don't do that...

896
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,350
因为我会很怀念一个人很平常的东西
...because I will miss of the person the most mundane things.

897
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,220
好比那些细节
Like I'm obsessed with little things.

898
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:57,890
或者也许我有点神经质，但当我小的时候…
Maybe I'm crazy,but when I was a little girl...

899
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:00,990
妈妈告诉我，我上学经常迟到
...my mom told me that I was always late to school.

900
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,530
有一天她跟着我想知道为什么
One day she followed me to see why.

901
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:08,030
我正看着栗子从树上掉下来，滚到便道上
I was looking at chestnuts falling from the trees, rolling on the sidewalk...

902
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:13,970
…或者是蚂蚁过马路，叶子在树干上的映出的倒影
...or ants crossing the road, the way a leaf casts a shadow on a tree trunk.

903
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,170
种种小事
Little things.

904
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,510
我想对人也是一样
I think it's the same with people.

905
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:21,910
我看到的是他们的细节，很细微
I see in them little details,so specific to each of them...

906
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:26,210
…那些能感动我的细节，然后我就会想念他们，一直想念
...that move me and that I miss and will always miss.

907
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:27,880
你不能取代任何人
You can never replace anyone...

908
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:32,010
因为每个人都有他那种美丽的，独特的细微之处
...because everyone is made of such beautiful, specific details.

909
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,760
就好像我记得，你的胡子上有一点红色
Like, I remember the way your beard has a bit of red in it...

910
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:42,190
…我记得你离开的那天早上…
...and how the sun was making it glow...

911
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,200
…朝阳是怎样照的它闪闪亮
...that morning right before you left.

912
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:50,040
我一直记着，我非常怀念
I remembered that, and I missed it.

913
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:51,540
很神经质，对吧？
Really crazy, right?

914
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:56,080
现在我明白了，你想知道为什么我写了那本烂书吗？
Now I know for sure. You wanna know why I wrote that stupid book?

915
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:59,220
- 为什么？ - 因为这样你就会参加巴黎的一场读者见面会
- Why?  - So you'd come to a reading in Paris...

916
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:03,580
…而我就可以走过去，问你：“你到底去哪里了？”
...and I could walk up to you and ask,"Where the fuck were you? "

917
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,220
你真的觉得我今天会来？
No... You think I'd be here today?

918
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:10,920
真的，我之所以写这本书，从某种意义来讲，就是为了能找到你
I'm serious. I think I wrote it,in a way, to try to find you.

919
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,220
好啦，这…我知道这不是真的
Okay, that's... I know that's not true...

920
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,730
- 不过听了还是很高兴  - 我觉得这是真的
- ...but that's sweet of you.  - I think it is true.

921
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,400
我们还有机会再见面吗？
What were the chances of us ever meeting again?

922
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:22,400
过了那个十二月，我想机率基本就是零了吧
After that December,I'd say almost zero.

923
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:24,870
不过反正我们也不是来真的，对吗？
But we're not real anyway, right?

924
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:28,240
我们只不过是那个老妇人梦中的角色
We're just characters in that old lady's dream.

925
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:30,820
她在她的病床上回忆年轻时的故事
She's on her deathbed,fantasizing about her youth.

926
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:33,080
所以我们当然会见面！
So of course we had to meet again.

927
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:37,190
天哪！你为什么那天没有出现在维也纳？
Oh, God. Why weren't you there in Vienna?

928
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:42,090
- 我告诉过你了！ - 我知道，但是…
- I told you why.  - I know why, I just....

929
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:44,490
我真的希望你去了！
I wish you would have been.

930
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,930
我们的生活可能会完全不一样！
Our lives might have been so much different.

931
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,300
你真这么觉得？
You think so?

932
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:51,100
没错
I actually do.

933
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,430
也许不会呢，也许最后我们会憎恨对方呢
Maybe not. Maybe we would have hated each other eventually.

934
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,510
是吗，就像现在我们这样憎恨对方？
What, like we hate each other now?

935
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:02,940
你知道的，可能我们…我们只适合那种偶遇…
You know, maybe we're... We're only good at brief encounters...

936
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:07,310
…在温暖的天气里，漫步在欧洲的街头
...walking around in European cities,in warm climate.

937
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:10,950
天哪，为什么我们没有交换电话号码呢？
Oh, God. Why didn't we exchange phone numbers and stuff?

938
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,290
为什么？
Why didn't we do that?

939
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,830
因为那时我们太年轻，不成熟？
Because we were young and stupid.

940
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,290
你觉得我们现在还是如此吗？
Do you think we still are?

941
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:20,590
我觉得，当你年轻的时候，你会相信…
I guess when you're young you just believe...

942
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:23,290
…你会认识很多人
...there'll be many people you'll connect with.

943
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:26,600
但后来你才会发现能交流的人其实很少
Later in life you realize it only happens a few times.

944
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:30,370
何况你又不能保证和他们好好相处，就这样，失去联系了
And you can screw it up, you know.Misconnect.

945
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:33,010
过去的就让它过去吧，事情本来就是这样的
The past is the past.It was meant to be that way.

946
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,840
你真的相信吗？任何事情都是注定的？
You really believe that?That everything's fated?

947
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:40,010
这个嘛，你明白吗，世界也许没有我们想的那么多变
Well, you know, the world might be less free than we think.

948
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:41,880
是吗？
Yeah?

949
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:46,060
如果给定了特定的条件，就总会发生一样的结果
When given these exact circumstances,that's what will happen every time.

950
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:49,290
两份氢，一份氧，获得的总是水
Two part hydrogen, one part oxygen,you'll get water every time.

951
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:52,860
不，我是说如果你祖母晚去世一个礼拜呢？
No, I mean, what if your grandmother had lived a week longer, you know?

952
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:55,660
或者是早一个礼拜去世？甚至是几天？
Or passed away a week earlier?Days, even?

953
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,390
事情都可能完全不一样！我坚信这一点！
Things might have been different.

954
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:01,800
- 不，你不能这样想，那只是…  - 我知道对于大多数事情来说的确是注定的
- You can't think like that, it's...  - You shouldn't on most things, but....

955
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:07,170
但是，只是这件事，我觉得这事很不对劲
It's just, on this one, it seemed like something was off, you know.

956
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,410
你知道吗，在我结婚前的那个月，我一直都在想着你
In the months leading up to my wedding,I was thinking about you all the time.

957
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:15,420
即使在去婚礼的路上，我坐在车里，我的一个朋友送我进城
Even on my way there, I'm in the car, a buddy of mine is driving me downtown...

958
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:18,350
…我看着窗户，觉得我看到你了
...and I'm staring out the window and I think I see you...

959
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:20,690
…离教堂不远…
...not far from the church, right...

960
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:23,350
…收起一把雨伞，走进一家熟食店…
...folding up an umbrella and walking into a deli...

961
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:27,160
…就在百老汇和十三街的交汇处
...on the corner of 13th and Broadway.

962
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:30,860
那时我觉得我快要发疯了你知道吗？但现在我觉得这也许就是你
And I thought I was going crazy.But now I think it probably was you.

963
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:34,300
我住在百老汇和十一街的交汇处
I lived on 11 th and Broadway.

964
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:36,940
你看！
You see?

965
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:42,010
那，结婚的感觉怎样，你还没说呢
So, what is it like to be married?You haven't talked much about that.

966
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,440
我没有吗？真奇怪
I haven't? How weird.

967
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:50,910
我不知道怎么说，我们是在上大学的时候认识的
I don't know. We met, you know,when I was in college.

968
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:57,460
有几年，我们分分合合，然后…
And we broke up and got back together for a period of years, and then....

969
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:02,330
怎么来着？我们好像又在一起了，然后她就怀孕了…
What? We were sort of back together and she was pregnant...

970
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:04,560
所以就结婚咯
...so marriage.

971
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,760
她怎么样？
What is she like?

972
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:09,970
她是个好老师，好妈妈
She's a great teacher, a good mom.

973
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:13,200
她很聪明，很漂亮
She's smart, pretty, you know.

974
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,440
我记得那时我想…
I remember thinking at the time...

975
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:17,980
…很多我所崇拜的人…
...that so many of the men that I admired most...

976
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:22,990
…他们的生命都奉献给了比自己更重要的东西
...that their lives were dedicated to something greater than themselves.

977
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,450
所以你结婚是因为你崇拜的人都结婚了？
So you got married because men you admired were married?

978
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:32,900
不，不…准确来说是…我内心中有种对自我的完美期许
No, no. It's more like I had this... This idea of my best self, you know?

979
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:34,800
你懂吗？我想去追求那种自我
And I wanted to pursue that...

980
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:37,730
即使代价是失去真实的自我！
...even if it might have been overriding my honest self.

981
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,300
你懂我的意思吗？
You know what I'm saying?

982
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:44,000
我记得在那个时候，我并不觉得和“谁”结婚这个问题很重要
In the moment, I remember thinking it didn't much matter, the who of it all.

983
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,740
一个人并不是你生命的全部
I mean, that nobody is gonna be everything to you...

984
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:49,780
…到头来这只是一种负责的表现…
...and that it's just the action of committing yourself...

985
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:53,440
…就是说，负担起你的责任来，这才是最重要的
...you know, meeting your responsibilities, that matters.

986
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:57,250
我是说，爱是什么？如果它不是尊敬，信赖和钦佩的话？
I mean, what is love, right,if it's not respect, trust, admiration?

987
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:00,480
而我当时都感觉到了啊
And I... I felt all those things.

988
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:03,530
谈到现在，我感觉我好像在办一个托儿所
Cut to the present,and I feel like I'm running a nursery...

989
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,360
…跟一个我曾经约会过的人
...with somebody I used to date you know.

990
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:08,360
我是说，我就像一个修道士
I mean, I'm like a monk, you know.

991
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:13,440
我在过去的四年中，做爱还不到十次
I mean, I've had sex less than 10 times in the last four years.

992
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,500
- 干嘛，干嘛？你笑我？ - 没有
- What, what? You laughing at me?  - No.

993
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,510
- 听起来很可悲吗？ - 你看到过有修道士做过十次爱的吗？
- It sounds pathetic?  - What monastery do monks have sex...?

994
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,010
好，你是对的，我比一般的修道士强，可以了吧？
Okay, you're right, I'm doing better than most monks.

995
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,670
但是我的确觉得，如果现在有人碰我的话
But I do, I feel like if somebody were to touch me...

996
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:28,050
我就会马上融化的了
...I would dissolve into molecules.

997
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,990
好啦，我们到了，该走了，快
Well, we're here. We've gotta go.Come on.

998
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,020
该死
Shit.

999
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:41,530
- [法语]晚上好  - [法语]晚上好
- Bonsoir!  - Bonsoir!

1000
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:48,510
- 我很遗憾听到那些  - 什么？
- I'm sorry to hear that, you know.  - What?

1001
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,740
你对你的婚姻好像不怎么满意
You're not that happy with your marriage.

1002
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:54,570
- 我刚才说到的那个朋友，她是神经科医生  - 她怎么了？
- This friend of mine, she's a shrink...  - How's she doing?

1003
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:56,340
她的生活很糟，不过…
She's a mess, but....

1004
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,750
她告诉我她遇过很多夫妻…
No, she said she's been dealing with couples that are breaking up...

1005
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:02,080
- 为了同样的理由而分开  - 什么理由？
- ...for the same reason.  - What reason is that?

1006
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:05,020
他们都期望，在共同生活了几年以后
They all expected, after a few years of living together...

1007
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:07,520
…他们的热情，欲望还和当初一样
...for the passion, that desire,to be the same.

1008
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:09,160
- 这是不可能的！ - 是啊，没错
- Yeah, right.  - It's impossible.

1009
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:10,660
而且谢天谢地…
And thank God...

1010
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:14,560
…如果我们一直保持激情的话，我们会得动脉瘤的
...we'd end up with aneurysms in that constant state of excitement, right?

1011
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:16,530
我们一生将一事无成
We'd do nothing at all with our lives.

1012
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:20,200
如果你每五分钟就做一次爱，你还能写完你的书吗？
Would you have finished your book if you were fucking every five minutes?

1013
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:22,970
我很乐意接受这个挑战
I might have welcomed the challenge,I mean....

1014
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,910
但是，你懂吗，很自然的，当你太太生了小孩以后
It's natural for your wife after the birth of your son...

1015
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,710
- 她就会把她的爱转移到小孩身上  - 当然
- ...to give all her love to the little one.  - Of course.

1016
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,040
想想看如果她执迷于性爱，像野猫一样不停挑逗你
If she was obsessed with sex,riding you like a wildcat....

1017
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,950
这不合情理，对吧？
That wouldn't make any sense, right?

1018
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,720
不是这样的，你说得都很有道理，但这不是性的问题
Everything you're saying makes sense.It's not about sex.

1019
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:40,090
是啊，我知道，很明显不是
No, I know. It's obvious.

1020
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:41,850
我…
I....

1021
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,190
你知道，现在的夫妻感情很复杂
You know, couples are so confused lately.

1022
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:48,630
我觉得肯定是因为…
I think it must be that...

1023
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,760
…男人总想让人觉得他们很重要，但事实已不是这样了
...men need to feel essential and they don't anymore.

1024
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:55,460
多年以来，这种观念深植于他们脑海之中…
It's been imprinted in their head for so many years...

1025
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,370
…好像他们就必须要是家里的顶梁柱
...that they had to be the provider.

1026
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:01,210
比如，我在工作中就是一个坚强，独立的女性
Like, I'm a strong, independent woman in my professional life.

1027
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:02,910
我不需要一个男人养我
I don't need a man to feed me...

1028
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:06,420
…但我仍要一个男人爱我，而我也爱他
...but I still need a man to love me and that I could love.

1029
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:10,450
- 好啦，我看到你的司机了  - 是的
- So your driver's here.  - Yeah.

1030
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,320
那，我想我该告别了
Well, I guess this is goodbye.

1031
00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:14,150
- 你最好把你的…  - 不
- You better give me your...  - No, no.

1032
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:16,560
我们不如送你回家吧
Why don't we just give you a ride home?

1033
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,060
- 这个嘛，我可以搭地铁，我没事  - 不，我…
- Well, I can take the Metro. I'm fine.  - No, I...

1034
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:22,170
我的飞机要十点才飞，我会提前两个钟头去
My flight's not until 10.I'll be arriving two hours early.

1035
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:23,770
这样我们就可以继续谈了
This way we can keep talking.

1036
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:26,060
- 先生，能…？ - 那不顺路的
- Monsieur, can...?  - It's not on the way.

1037
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:30,150
[法语]您能把我带到马场附近的十号路吗？
Ca vous arrive me deposer au passage Dix Rue des petits ecuries?

1038
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:31,450
[法语]当然可以
Oui, oui.

1039
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:33,650
- [法语]我们走吧  - [法语]麻烦您了
- Allons-y!  - Ca peut etre trop tard?

1040
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,250
[法语]不，不，没问题
No, no, ce n'est pas de probleme!

1041
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:38,250
[法语]您就把我带到“水塔”地铁站附近就行了
Vous pouvez me laisser au metro...au metro Chateau d'Eau.

1042
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:40,250
- [法语]好吗？ - [法语]好的，没问题
- Ca ira tres bien.  - Entendu!

1043
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:40,800
[法语]谢谢
Merci!

1044
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:42,750
你把你的住址什么的都告诉他了？
You told him where you are and all that?

1045
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,550
是的
Yeah.

1046
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:50,330
- 他知道他要去哪了？ - 是的
- He knows where he's going?  - Yes.

1047
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,360
太好了
Glad somebody does.

1048
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:56,660
- 这比搭地铁好，对吧？ - 当然
- But this is better than the Metro, right?  - Definitely.

1049
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:03,510
我在想，对我来说，还是不要把事情想得太浪漫比较好
I was thinking, for me it's better I don't romanticize things as much anymore.

1050
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,540
我一直都吃这个亏
I was suffering so much all the time.

1051
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:09,200
我仍旧有很多梦想，但它们都与我的感情生活无关
I still have lots of dreams,but they're not in regard to my love life.

1052
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:11,820
这样并不会让我不开心，因为事情本来就是这样的
It doesn't make me sad,it's just the way it is.

1053
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:16,150
这就是你为什么要和一个不常见面的人发生感情吗？
Is that why you're in a relationship with somebody who's never around?

1054
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:20,220
当然，我应付不了那种天天见面的感情
Yes, obviously I can't deal with the day-to-day life of a relationship.

1055
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:22,490
我们相聚的时候可以充满激情
Yeah, we have this exciting time together...

1056
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:26,030
…然后他离去了，我会很想他，不过我起码不会痛不欲生
...and he leaves and I miss him,but at least I'm not dying inside.

1057
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,630
如果有人一直在我身边，我会觉得窒息！
When someone's always around me,I'm suffocating.

1058
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,700
等等，可是你刚说你想要爱和被爱
No, wait, you just said that you need to love and be loved.

1059
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,740
没错，但是当我的确这么做时，这马上会让我恶心！
Yeah, but when I do,it quickly makes me nauseous.

1060
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:36,370
真是个灾难
It's a disaster.

1061
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,200
我是说，我只有一个人独处的时候才会真正开心
I mean, I'm really happy only when I'm on my own.

1062
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:44,250
即使是一个人，也比坐在情人边上却心不在焉要来的好
Even being alone, it's better than sitting next to a lover and feeling lonely.

1063
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,850
浪漫对我来说并不是一件容易的事
It's not so easy for me to be a romantic.

1064
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:50,510
你开始的时候可能会这么做，不过当你受过几次伤以后…
You start off that way, and after you've been screwed over a few times...

1065
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:55,020
…你就会拒绝那些虚幻的想法，接受生活中的现实
...you forget about your delusional ideas and you take what comes into your life.

1066
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:58,190
其实这也不见得对，我并没受过几次伤…
That's not even true.I haven't been screwed over...

1067
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:00,760
…我只是有太多平庸的感情了
...I've just had too many blah relationships.

1068
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:02,760
他们不是对我不好，他们都很关心我…
They weren't mean,they cared for me...

1069
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:06,430
…但是我们却没有那种心灵上的沟通，或是发自心底的兴奋
...but there were no real connection or excitement.

1070
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,770
起码我这边是这么感觉的
At least, not from my side.

1071
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:11,600
天哪，真遗憾，有这么糟糕吗？
God, I'm sorry, is it really that bad?

1072
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:13,840
没有吧，对吗？
It's not, right?

1073
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,850
你知道吗，其实也不是这样的，我…
You know, it's not even that.I was....

1074
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:21,180
我本来是好好的，直到我读到你那本该死的书
I was fine until I read your fucking book.

1075
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:23,350
它把陈年往事又翻起来了，你知道吗？
It stirred shit up, you know?

1076
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,350
它让我想起了，我曾经真正的浪漫过
It reminded me how genuinely romantic I was...

1077
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:28,690
…我对于世界有过多少希望…
...how I had so much hope in things...

1078
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:32,390
…而我现在已经完全不相信任何爱情了
...and now it's like I don't believe in anything that relates to love.

1079
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:34,560
我已经感觉不到人之间的感情了
I don't feel things for people anymore.

1080
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:39,360
从某种意义上来说，我所有的浪漫都在一夜之间消耗光了…
In a way, I put all my romanticism into that one night...

1081
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:42,030
…而我将永远不可能再有那种感觉了
...and I was never able to feel all this again.

1082
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:44,730
就好像，那一夜不知道怎么，引发了我的全部感情…
Like, somehow this night took things away from me...

1083
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:47,310
…而我把这些感情都向你倾诉出来，而你却把它们都从我身边带走了
...and I expressed them to you,and you took them with you.

1084
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,380
这让我感到孤独！好像爱情再也不属于我一样！
It made me feel cold,like love wasn't for me.

1085
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:52,280
我不相信，我不相信
I don't believe that.I don't believe that.

1086
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:57,790
你知道吗？对我来说，现实和爱基本就是矛盾的
You know what? Reality and love are almost contradictory for me.

1087
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:02,260
非常可笑，我每一个以前的男友，他们都结婚了
It's funny, every single of my exes,they're now married.

1088
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:05,330
男人约我出去，然后我们分手，然后他们就结婚了
Men go out with me, we break up,and then they get married.

1089
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,990
之后之后他们打电话感谢我，教会了他们什么是爱
And later they call me to thank me for teaching them what love is...

1090
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,670
…教会了他们去关心跟尊重女人！
...and that I taught them to care and respect women.

1091
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,240
- 我想我也是那些男人中的一个  - 你知道吗，我真想杀了他们！
- I think I'm one of those.  - I want to kill them!

1092
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:18,070
他们为什么不向我求婚？我也许会拒绝，但至少他们也应该问我啊！
Why didn't they ask me? I would have said no, but they could have asked!

1093
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,010
但我知道这是我的错，因为我总觉得他们不是我的如意郎君
I know it's my fault because I never felt it was the right man.

1094
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:25,450
从来没有，但如意的人又是什么呢？你的真爱？
Never. But what does it mean,the right man, the love of your life?

1095
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:28,950
这种想法简直可笑，说什么我们只有找到了另一半人生才是完整的
The concept is absurd. We can only be complete with another person.

1096
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,520
- 这太可恶了，不是吗？ - 我能说两句吗？
- It's evil, right?  - Can I talk?

1097
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:35,130
我想我是伤心过太多次了，然后又恢复了
I guess I've been heartbroken too many times and then I recovered.

1098
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:37,920
于是现在，从一开始，我就不愿意付出努力
So now, you know, from the starts,I make no effort.

1099
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,860
- 因为我知道一定不能成功  - 你不能这样
- I know it's not gonna work out.  - You can't do that.

1100
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,970
你不可以只是为了避免受伤害
You can't live trying to avoid pain...

1101
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:44,970
- 就付出…  - 好啦，我决定了
- ...at the expense...  - Those are words.

1102
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:46,600
我要离你远远的
I've gotta get away from you.

1103
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:48,930
- 停车，我要下车！ - 不，别下车
- Stop the car, I wanna get out.  - No, don't...

1104
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:51,010
- 你知道在你身边…  - 请继续讲…
- Keep talking.  - It's being around you.

1105
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:53,540
别碰我！你知道吗，我要叫辆计程车…
Don't touch me, you know.I want to get on a cab.

1106
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:54,950
[法语]请停车，先生
Monsieur, aretes vous!

1107
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:56,250
[法语]过了红绿灯您就停，我去坐地铁
Non, non, c'est bon, aux feux-la!

1108
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,680
别，别停，继续开…
No, don't. No, no, keep going.

1109
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:02,450
听我说，我真的很高兴…谢谢你，请继续开…
Listen, I'm just so happy...Thank you, just keep going.

1110
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:04,320
好啦
All right.

1111
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:09,390
听我说，我真得很高兴能跟你在一起
Look, I'm just so happy,all right, to be with you.

1112
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:12,960
我真得很高兴你没有忘记我
I am. I'm so glad you didn't forget about me, okay?

1113
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:15,830
是的，我没有，而这吓坏我了，知道吗？
No, I didn't.And it pisses me off, okay?

1114
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:19,700
你到巴黎来，给我带来浪漫，但却结了婚
You come here to Paris,all romantic, and married.

1115
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:21,340
去死吧你！
Okay? Screw you.

1116
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:24,540
不要误会我，我并没有想要占有你
Don't get me wrong,I'm not trying to get you.

1117
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:27,180
我只不过想把自己嫁出去
I mean, all I need is a married man.

1118
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:31,150
这个问题很复杂，这甚至不仅仅是关于你
There's been so much water under the bridge, it's not even about you.

1119
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,790
还有那段过去的时光，那段永远不会再回来的时光！
It's about that moment in time that's forever gone.

1120
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:36,890
你说了这么多，但你却根本不记得我们做过爱
You say that, but you didn't even remember having sex, so....

1121
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:39,920
我当然记得
Of course I remembered.

1122
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:43,490
- 你记得？ - 没错！
- You did?  - Yes.

1123
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:47,030
- 女人总喜欢这么掩饰自己  - 是吗？
- Women pretend things like that.  - They do?

1124
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:51,190
我应该说什么呢？说我记得公园里的红酒…
What was I supposed to say?That I remember the wine in the park...

1125
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:54,860
…说我们我们一起看着星星落下太阳升起！
...and us looking up at the stars fading away as the sun came up?

1126
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,410
我们做了两次爱，你这混蛋！
We had sex twice, you idiot!

1127
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:03,580
好啦，你知道吗，我真得很高兴看到你
All right, you know what,I'm just happy to see you.

1128
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:07,220
即使你已变得易怒和神经质
Even if you've become an angry,manic-depressive activist...

1129
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:10,880
我还是很喜欢你，我还是愿意跟你待在一起！
...I still like you,I still enjoy being around you.

1130
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:15,930
我也是，对不起，我不知道怎么了，我只是…
And I feel the same. I'm sorry.I don't know what happened, I just....

1131
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:18,560
- 我需要发泄，我…  - 没事
- I had to let it all out.  - Don't worry about it.

1132
01:00:18,730 --> 01:00:21,360
我的感情生活太不顺利了
I'm so miserable in my love life,in my relationship.

1133
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:24,700
所以我总是装作…好像我不在意它
I always act as...Like, you know, I'm detached.

1134
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:28,030
但我真得痛不欲生，因为麻木而痛不欲生
But I'm dying inside.I'm dying because I'm so numb.

1135
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:31,940
我不能感受到伤心和兴奋，我也不会感到苦涩，我只是…
I don't feel pain or excitement,I'm not even bitter, I'm just....

1136
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:34,770
你以为只有你痛不欲生吗？
You think you're the one dying inside?

1137
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:39,150
我的生活每时每刻全像是地狱
My life is 24/7 bad.

1138
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:40,650
- 对不起…  - 不要…
- I'm sorry.  - No, no.

1139
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:43,750
我唯一的快乐就是跟我儿子出去
I mean, the only happiness I get is when I'm out with my son.

1140
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,580
我去找了婚姻咨询
I've been to marriage counseling...

1141
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,390
我做了我从来没想过我会做的事
...I've done things I never thought I would have to do.

1142
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:51,500
我点了蜡烛，买了自助读物，女性内衣…
I've lit candles,bought self-help books, lingerie.

1143
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:54,060
- 蜡烛有用吗？ - 有个鬼用！
- Did the candles help?  - Hell, no.

1144
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:56,720
我没法用她想要的方式爱她
I don't love her the way she needs to be loved...

1145
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:01,340
…我甚至根本看不到我们的未来，但当我看到我的小儿子
...and I don't even see a future for us,but then I look at my little boy...

1146
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:04,910
…坐在桌子的对面，我就觉得我愿意承受一切折磨…
...sitting across from me,and I think I'd suffer any torture...

1147
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,440
…只要能跟他一起度过他生命中的每一刻
...to be with him for all the minutes of his life.

1148
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:09,480
我一刻也不想缺
I don't want to miss out on one.

1149
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:13,980
但是我的家里没有欢笑，没有快乐
But then, there's no joy or laughter in my home, you know?

1150
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:17,850
- 我不希望他在这样的环境中长大  - 没有欢笑？那可太糟了
- I don't want him growing up in that.  - No laughter? That's terrible.

1151
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:19,960
我的父母在一起已经有三十五年了
My parents have been together 35 years...

1152
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:22,460
而即使他们吵架之后，他们还会笑得一样开心
...and even when they fight they end up laughing.

1153
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:26,430
我不想变成那种人，在五十二岁时离了婚…
I don't want to be one of those people who are getting divorced at 52...

1154
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:31,000
…落着泪，承认从来就没有爱过自己的伴侣…
...and falling down into tears, admitting they never really loved their spouse...

1155
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:36,200
…感觉自己的生活好像完全被吸尘器吸走一样，一片空虚
...and they feel their life has been sucked up into a vacuum cleaner.

1156
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:40,000
我也想拥有美好的生活，我也希望她拥有美好的生活
You know, I want a great life.I want her to have a great life...

1157
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:42,410
这是她应得的！
...she deserves that.

1158
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:45,950
但现在我们只是假装维系着婚姻，责任
But we're just living in the pretense of a marriage, responsibility...

1159
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:50,110
…过着那种人们觉得你该过的日子
...you know, all these ideas of how people are supposed to live.

1160
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:55,690
然后，我…我做了一个梦
But then I... I have these dreams....

1161
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,560
什么梦？
What dreams?

1162
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:02,220
我做了一个梦
I have these dreams,you know, that...

1163
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,690
…梦见我站在月台上
...I'm standing on a platform...

1164
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:09,130
…而你不停的坐火车经过
...and you keep going by on a train...

1165
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:13,710
…你就是不停的经过，经过，经过
...and you go by, and you go by,and you go by, you go by.

1166
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,740
然后我被吓醒，浑身冷汗
And I wake up with the fucking sweats.

1167
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:18,210
然后我又做了一个梦…
And then I have this other dream...

1168
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:22,250
…梦见你怀孕了，在床上躺在我身边，一丝不挂…
...where you're pregnant in bed beside me naked...

1169
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:26,250
…而我非常非常想要抚摸你，但你跟我说不要，然后你就把头别过去
...and I want so badly to touch you, but you tell me not to and you look away.

1170
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:30,920
然后我…我还是抚摸了你…
And I... And I touch you anyway...

1171
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:35,560
…摸你的脚踝那里，你的皮肤是那样的柔软，使得我在哭泣中醒来
...right on your ankle, and your skin is so soft that I wake up in sobs, all right?

1172
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:39,770
我的妻子就坐在那里，看着我，我却觉得她离我万里之遥
My wife is there looking at me,and I feel I'm a million miles from her.

1173
01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:44,000
我知道那不对劲，我…
And I know that there's something wrong, that I...

1174
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:46,170
天啊！我不能再这样活下去了…
God, that I can't keep living like this...

1175
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:48,870
…爱的意义一定不仅仅是责任
...that there's gotta be more to love than commitment.

1176
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,880
但然后我又想，也许我已经不相信…
But then I think that I might have given up...

1177
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:53,950
…浪漫的爱情了
...on the whole idea of romantic love.

1178
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:57,420
我可能早已经不信了
That I might have put it to bed that...

1179
01:02:57,590 --> 01:03:00,350
自从那天我在那里没有见你
That day when you weren't there.

1180
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:03,260
我想，我可能就开始消沉了
You know, I think I might have done that.

1181
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,730
你为什么要和我说这些？
Why are you telling me all this?

1182
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:11,800
对不起，我不知道，我…我应该…
I'm sorry. I don't know.I'm... I should....

1183
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:14,940
我不应该说的
I shouldn't have.

1184
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:16,700
你知道，太奇怪了
You know, it's so weird.

1185
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,900
人们总是觉得自己是唯一痛苦的人
People think they are the only one going through tough times.

1186
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:25,410
当我读那些文章的时候，我觉得你的生活是完美的
I mean, when I read the article,I thought your life was perfect.

1187
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:29,620
有太太，孩子，出版了自己的作品
A wife, a kid, published author.

1188
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:33,620
现在看来你的生活比我还糟！
But your personal life is more of a mess than mine.

1189
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:36,120
对不起！
I'm sorry.

1190
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,750
起码有些方面还过得去
Well, I'm glad it's good for something.

1191
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:39,450
[法语]噢，先生，就是那儿！
Oh, monsieur, c'est la!

1192
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:42,120
[法语]把车停到那个通道里就行了
Rentrez dans la passe-la.

1193
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:45,400
- 这里就是你住的地方？ - 没错
- This is where you live?  - Yeah.

1194
01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:50,470
那现在看到我的生活比你还糟，觉得舒服点了吧？
So you're just relieved that I'm in even more deep shit than you are?

1195
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,510
是的，你让我感觉好多了
Yes, you've made me feel better.

1196
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,840
哦，那就好，我很高兴…
Oh, good, I'm glad.

1197
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:57,480
不，我真的希望你的生活可以更好
No, I really wish you the best.

1198
01:03:57,650 --> 01:04:01,310
我不会因为自己无法有良好的感情，或是美好的家庭
It's not because I'm incapable of having a good relationship or a family...

1199
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:03,610
就想要别人也跟我一样不开心
...that I wish everyone to be doomed like me.

1200
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:06,160
我知道你总有一天会成为…一个伟大的母亲的！
I'm sure you'd make... Be a great mom someday.

1201
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:07,820
- 真的？你真的这么认为？ - 没错
- Really? You think so?  - Yeah...

1202
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:11,120
只要服一些抗忧郁药，你就行了！
...a few antidepressants, you know,you'll do great.

1203
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:14,760
- 喊停！ - 停！
- Okay, say stop.  - Stop.

1204
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,930
- 好啦  - 准备好了吗？好啦
- Okay.  - You ready? Okay.

1205
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:32,280
- 我想试一下  - 什么？
- So I want to try something.  - What?

1206
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:39,090
我想看看你是会保持原样还是会融化
I want to see if you stay together or if you dissolve into molecules.

1207
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:42,060
我融化了吗？
How am I doing?

1208
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:44,160
保持原样！
Still here.

1209
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:46,490
很好，我喜欢住在这儿
Good. I like being here.

1210
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:51,960
这是你的公寓吗？
Is this your apartment?

1211
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:53,830
不，我住在那里
No, I live down there.

1212
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:56,240
- 那里？ - 是的
- Down there?  - Yeah.

1213
01:04:56,410 --> 01:04:58,900
先生，我想送她进家门
Monsieur, I'm gonna walk her to her door.

1214
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:04,550
[法语]他要送我进家门
Il va m'accompagner...a la porte.

1215
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:09,320
太不可思议了！
This is incredible.

1216
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:12,180
- 这就是你住的地方？ - 是的
- This is where you live?  - Yeah.

1217
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:15,560
- 你搬来这里多久了？ - 四年了
- How long have you been here?  - Four years.

1218
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:19,260
- 那告诉我…  - 什么？
- So tell me....  - What?

1219
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:21,090
你讲的那些你的梦，是真的吗？
Is it all true about your dreams...

1220
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:24,030
还是只是为了骗我上床？
...or did you say that to hopefully get in my pants?

1221
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,760
当然只是骗你上床啦！
I said that to get in your pants.

1222
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:28,430
- 这是我的惯用伎俩  - 哦，有用吗？
- I use that all the time.  - Oh, okay. Does it work?

1223
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:31,540
嗯，有时候
You know. Sometimes.

1224
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:36,200
这是我的猫咪，哦，太可爱了，看看它
Here's my kitty. Oh, so cute.Look at him.

1225
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:38,210
你知道我喜欢他的什么吗？
You know what I love about this cat?

1226
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:40,680
每天早上我带他下来
Every morning I bring him to the courtyard...

1227
01:05:40,890 --> 01:05:45,590
…每一个早晨，他都会像是第一次来到这个院子一样！
...and every single morning he looks at everything like it was the first time.

1228
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:49,850
每个角落，每棵树，每棵植物
Every corner, every tree, every plant.

1229
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:52,460
都用他可爱的小鼻子去闻闻
Smells everything with his little cute nose.

1230
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:56,730
我太喜欢他了！
Oh, I love my kitty. I love my kitty.

1231
01:05:57,970 --> 01:05:59,870
- 他叫什么？ - 奇
- What's his name?  - Che.

1232
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,400
奇？
Che?

1233
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,480
- 怎么了？ - 听起来像共产党员
- What?  - Commie.

1234
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:10,940
不，“奇”在阿根廷是用来打招呼用的！
No, "che" in argentina means "hey."

1235
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:13,550
- 真的？ - 是的
- Okay.  - Yes.

1236
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,450
哦，宝贝，哦，好啊，好啊
Oh, baby. Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1237
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:24,630
我们晚上有个聚餐！超好玩的！
We're having a little party.It's so much fun.

1238
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:27,850
[法语]你为晚餐准备了什么好东西？
Qu'est-ce que vous avez fait bon pour ce soir?

1239
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:28,850
[法语]塔布雷色拉
Un taboule!

1240
01:06:28,850 --> 01:06:30,950
[法语]我过五分钟下来
Je vais descendre dans cinq minutes!

1241
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:31,950
[法语]你好
Salut!

1242
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,500
[法语]你好
Salut!

1243
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:36,550
- 那…  - 那
- So....  - So.

1244
01:06:37,350 --> 01:06:39,450
[法语]这是谁？帅哥啊！
C'est qui celui-la? Il est mignon!

1245
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:41,450
- [法语]他和我们共进晚餐吗？ - [法语]不，他要赶飞机
- Il mange avec nous?  - Non, il prend l'avion.

1246
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:44,450
[法语]可惜他尝不到我的拿手菜了
Tant pis! Il ne goutera pas mes paton pois chiches.

1247
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:45,950
[法语]他为什么不留下吃晚饭？
Pour-quo'il ne mange pas avec nous?

1248
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:48,150
[法语]他不喜欢你的短裤！
Il n'aime pas ton short!

1249
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:50,760
[法语]我的短裤怎么了？
Mais qu'es-ce qu'il a mon short?

1250
01:06:52,830 --> 01:06:57,290
你知道吗？我在想，你可以唱一首你的歌给我听吗？
You know what? I was thinking,would you play me one of your songs?

1251
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:59,620
- 你会错过你的班机的！ - 不，不会的！
- You're gonna miss your flight.  - I won't.

1252
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,700
我坐在候机厅也只不过是读一个小时的报纸
I'm gonna be in the airport for over an hour, reading...

1253
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:05,800
…所以还是听你唱一首歌给我听吧
...wishing you'd played me one of your songs.

1254
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,200
一首？好吧，不过很短的
One song? Okay, but quickly.

1255
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:10,170
好的
Okay.

1256
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:18,750
我太喜欢这老楼梯了
God, I love these old staircases.

1257
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:59,320
- 拿着！ - 什么，让我来？
- Hold this.  - What, for me?

1258
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:01,520
嘿，小家伙
Hey there, buddy.

1259
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:04,690
奇
Che.

1260
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:19,940
- 你想喝点茶吗？ - 好啊
- Would you like some tea?  - Yeah, sure.

1261
01:08:20,450 --> 01:08:22,070
哇
Wow.

1262
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:26,570
- 甘菊茶好吗？ - 嗯，很好
- Is chamomile okay?  - Yeah. Great.

1263
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:29,020
- [法语]谢谢！ - 乱？[谐音]
- Merci.  - Messy?

1264
01:08:29,190 --> 01:08:32,920
- 你觉得我的房间很乱？ - 不不不，我是说谢谢
- You think my apartment is messy?  - No, no. Merci.

1265
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:36,620
- [法语]非常感谢  - 哦，谢谢
- Merci beaucoup.  - Ah, merci.

1266
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:40,560
我想告诉你，你的法语进步很多
I meant to tell you,your French has improved a lot.

1267
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:42,060
- 真的吗？ - 没错！
- Really?  - Yeah.

1268
01:08:42,230 --> 01:08:44,830
你已经完全掌握这门语言了
Yeah, you've really mastered the language.

1269
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,730
好吧，那你想要唱哪首歌？
All right, all right, what song are you gonna play me?

1270
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:53,880
不行，我唱不了，这太丢人了
No, I can't. It's too embarrassing.It's been...

1271
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:57,740
哇！不行！我这么费劲上来就是为了这个，你不能这样坑我
Whoa. No way. No way. I came up here,you cannot crap out on me now.

1272
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,940
就一首，随便那首都行
One song. Anything will be great.

1273
01:09:00,150 --> 01:09:01,950
但你会笑我的
But listen, you're gonna laugh at me.

1274
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:03,610
- 你这么觉得？ - 是的！
- You think so?  - Yes.

1275
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:05,850
放心，我不会的
I doubt it.

1276
01:09:08,590 --> 01:09:09,990
好吧
Okay.

1277
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,560
你想听什么？我有…
What do you want to hear? I have....

1278
01:09:12,730 --> 01:09:15,060
我有三首英文歌
I have three songs in English.

1279
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:16,600
一首是唱我的猫的
One's about my cat...

1280
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:20,830
…一首是唱我的前男友，呃，前前男友…
...one's about my ex-boyfriend...Well, ex-ex-boyfriend...

1281
01:09:21,010 --> 01:09:23,500
…还有一首是…
...and there's one about....

1282
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:27,280
是首华尔兹
Well, it's just a little waltz.

1283
01:09:27,450 --> 01:09:29,570
华尔兹？
A waltz? Yeah.

1284
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:31,910
- 那就唱华尔兹吧  - 好吧
- Play the waltz.  - Right.

1285
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,520
我已经很久没弹吉他了，你确定你想听吗？
I haven't played it in a while.You sure?

1286
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:39,410
当然
Okay.

1287
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,460
好吧，华尔兹
All right, the waltz.

1288
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:59,170
让我唱首华尔兹
Let me sing you a waltz

1289
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:04,110
无从讲起，从我的心底
Out of nowhere, out of my thoughts

1290
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:08,810
让我唱首华尔兹
Let me sing you a waltz

1291
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:12,860
唱那次一夜缠绵
About this one-night stand

1292
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:19,660
那晚，你是我的
You were, for me, that night

1293
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:25,740
你是我生命中的全部梦想
Everything I always dreamt of in life

1294
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:29,470
但你已经不在了
But now you're gone

1295
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:33,870
你去了很远的地方
You are far-gone

1296
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:39,540
你那的雨中小岛
All the way to your island of rain

1297
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:45,590
对你来说，那只是一夜情
It was, for you, just a one-night thing

1298
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,730
对我来说却远远不止
But you were much more to me

1299
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,660
我想让你知道
Just so you know

1300
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:55,690
我不管别人怎样说
I don 't care what they say

1301
01:10:55,870 --> 01:11:00,830
我知道你对我的意义
I know what you meant For me that day

1302
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:05,840
我只想再来一次
I just want another try

1303
01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:11,010
我只想再来一夜
I just want another night

1304
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:18,210
即使这看起来毫无意义
Even if it doesn 't seem quite right

1305
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:22,420
但你对我来说
You meant, for me, much more

1306
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:26,930
要比任何人都更重要
Than anyone I've met before

1307
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:33,440
和你共度的一夜啊，小杰西
One single night with you, little Jesse

1308
01:11:33,610 --> 01:11:38,740
比得上和他人的一千个夜晚
Is worth a thousand with anybody

1309
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:43,150
我没有痛苦，亲亲
I have no bitterness, my sweet

1310
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:48,580
我永远不会忘记这一夜缠绵
I'll never forget this one-night thing

1311
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:54,890
即使明天我在他人怀中
Even tomorrow, in other arms

1312
01:11:55,060 --> 01:12:01,090
我的心还会随你而去，直到生命尽头
My heart will stay yours until I die

1313
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:10,070
让我唱一首华尔兹
Let me sing you a waltz

1314
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:15,270
无从讲起，从我的心底
Out of nowhere, out of my blues

1315
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:20,410
让我唱一首华尔兹
Let me sing you a waltz

1316
01:12:20,590 --> 01:12:25,780
唱那可爱的一夜情
About this lovely one-night stand

1317
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:46,500
- 不要停，再来一首，求你了  - 不行，说好了的！
- No, one more! Please, please.  - No! It was our deal.

1318
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:49,180
一首，就一首，别，别
One... One song. No, no, no.

1319
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:51,940
你可以喝完你的茶再…
You can have your tea and then....

1320
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,720
- 好吧，我问你个问题  - 什么？
- All right, let me ask you one question.  - What?

1321
01:12:59,890 --> 01:13:03,190
你是不是每次不管谁来就在歌词里换个名字？
Do you just plug that name in for every guy that comes up here?

1322
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,130
当然了
Yes, of course.

1323
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:09,360
你以为呢？我是写给你的？你疯了吗？
What do you think, that I wrote the song about you? Are you nuts?

1324
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:16,140
这是你吗？小对眼塞琳？
Is this you? Little cross-eyed Celine?

1325
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:18,870

- Yes. That's funny.  - Cute.

1326
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:23,680

1327
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:27,510
哇
Oh, wow.

1328
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:30,980
- 你要加点蜂蜜吗？ - 好的
- You want some honey?  - Yeah, sure.

1329
01:14:20,670 --> 01:14:22,970
你听过尼娜・西蒙的演唱会吗？
Did you ever see Nina Simone in concert?

1330
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:25,700
没有，不敢相信她已经不在了
No, I never did.I can't believe she's gone.

1331
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,530
我知道，太让人伤心了
I know, it's so sad.

1332
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,110
谢谢
Thanks.

1333
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:32,270
真热
It's hot.

1334
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:37,220
我听过她两次演唱会
I saw her twice in concert.

1335
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:40,120
她真棒！
She was so great.

1336
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:43,320
这是她的歌里我最喜欢的几首之一
That's one of my favorite songs of hers.

1337
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:00,510
她太棒了！
She was so great.

1338
01:15:02,450 --> 01:15:04,750
她在演唱会里太有趣了
She was so funny in concert too.

1339
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:09,080
她会…她会在一首歌唱到一半时的时候
She would... She would be right in the middle of a song and then...

1340
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:11,120
…你知道吗，停下来…
...you know, stop...

1341
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:15,350
…从钢琴边起身，一直走到舞台边上
...and walk from the piano all the way to the edge of the stage.

1342
01:15:15,530 --> 01:15:17,860
像这样，非常慢的
Like, really slowly.

1343
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:24,130
然后她开始对观众中的某人说话
And she'd start talking to someone in the audience.

1344
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:27,670
哦，耶，哦，耶
"Oh, yeah, baby. Oh, yeah.

1345
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,670
我也爱你
I love you too."

1346
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:35,550
然后她又走回去，不急不忙的，
And then she'd walk back.Take her time, no hurry, you know.

1347
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:39,210
她的大屁股真可爱
She had that big, cute ass.

1348
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:40,940
她就这么慢慢挪着
She would move.

1349
01:15:42,650 --> 01:15:47,490
然后就走回钢琴旁再唱一段
And then she would go back to the piano and play some more, you know.

1350
01:15:48,990 --> 01:15:50,660
然后她会，我也不知道…
And then she would, I don't know...

1351
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:53,320
…一首歌唱了一半又唱另外一首
...just start another song in the middle of another.

1352
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:57,300
你懂吗，好像，又停下，然后这样
You know, like,stop again, and be like:

1353
01:15:57,470 --> 01:16:01,460
那边那位，你能挪挪那电扇吗
"You over there,can you move that fan.

1354
01:16:02,370 --> 01:16:04,500
你真可爱
You're cute.

1355
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:27,520
哦，耶
Oh, yeah."

1356
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:35,370
宝贝，你会错过你的班机的
Baby, you are gonna miss that plane.

1357
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,580
我知道
I know.
