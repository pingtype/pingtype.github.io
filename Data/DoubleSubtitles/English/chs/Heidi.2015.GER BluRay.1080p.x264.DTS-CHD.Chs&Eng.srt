3
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:26,240
海蒂和爷爷

4
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,660
海蒂！过来！
Heidi! Come on!

5
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,580
你好，迪提
Hello, Dete.

6
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,790
好热
I'm hot.

7
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,240
- 还有多远？ - 海蒂，就在山顶
- Is it far?  - Heidi, it's right at the top.

8
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,660
你好，迪提
Hello, Dete.

9
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,040
你好
Hello.

10
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,120
- 这是你妹妹的女儿？ - 是的
- Is that your late sister's daughter?  - Yes.

11
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,200
- 过来，海蒂，我们要走了  - 她都长这么大了
- Come on, Heidi. We have to go.  - She's got so big.

12
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,870
过来
Come on.

13
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,040
你要带她去哪？
Where are you taking her?

14
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,240
- 到她爷爷那去  - 去阿蒙治叔叔那？
- To her grandfather.  - To the Alp-Uncle?

15
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,830
我的老天！
Good heavens!

16
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,790
迪提
Dete.

17
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,870
他很冷漠讨厌与人接触
He's godless and hates every living soul.

18
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,080
据说他甚至忘记了怎么说话
They say he even forgot how to speak.

19
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,790
我要把她寄养在别人家？
Am I meant to put her in a home?

20
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,620
或者把她交给我们不认识的农民家？
Or give her to some farmer we don't know?

21
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,240
你应当明白没有人想多养活一个人
You know that nobody wants an extra mouth to feed.

22
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,240
同陌生人呆在一起也许对她比较好
She might have been better off with strangers.

23
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,950
他甚至与自己的儿子闹翻了，愿上帝宽恕他的灵魂
He even fell out with his own son. May God rest his soul.

24
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,950
同时我确定他不会想和这个孩子扯上关系
And I'm sure he won't want anything to do with the child.

25
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,080
海蒂！你在哪？
Heidi! Where are you?

26
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,450
海蒂，马上过来
Heidi, come here right now!

27
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,160
过来！
Coming!

28
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,200
你好，爷爷
Hello, Grandfather.

29
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,790
你好，阿蒙治叔叔
Hello, Alp-Uncle.

30
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,660
她叫海蒂
This is Heidi.

31
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,870
你的孙女
Your grandchild.

32
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,370
我在法兰克福找到份工作
I've found a position in Frankfurt.

33
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,450
所以我把她带给你
So now I'm bringing her to you.

34
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,870
她毕竟流淌着你的血脉
She's your own flesh and blood after all.

35
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,040
带着她滚
Go! And take her with you.

36
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,490
我已经照顾她五年了
I've looked after her for five years.

37
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,540
- 现在没法照顾了  - 滚！
- But I can't do it anymore.  - Get out of here!

38
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,120
海蒂，听好了
Heidi, listen to me.

39
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,540
没有什么好害怕的
There's nothing to be scared of.

40
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,290
我确定你爷爷不会伤害你
I'm sure Uncle won't hurt you.

41
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,700
好的，过去吧
Right, now go.

42
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,620
去啊！
Go!

43
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,370
上帝原谅我吧
God forgive me.

44
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:44,200
孩子！把这孩子带走！
The child!Take the child with you!

45
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,790
过来，跟她走！
Go on, go with her!

46
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,580
她不要我了
But she doesn't want me either.

47
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:19,490
爷爷？
Grandfather?

48
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,700
早上好，爷爷
Good morning, Grandfather.

49
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,200
喝吧
Drink.

50
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,160
- 谢谢  - 我带你去牧师那一趟
- Thank you.  - I'll take you to the parson.

51
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,540
他会知道怎么处理你
He'll know what to do with you.

52
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,200
张嘴
Open up.

53
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,580
孩子很结实
The child is strong.

54
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,040
健康
And healthy.

55
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,870
她不会有问题的
She won't be much trouble.

56
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,870
她不能和我呆在一起
She can't stay with me.

57
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,290
好吧
Okay, fine.

58
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:48,830
- 这几天我要去迈恩费尔德一趟  - 也许有人可以收留她
- I'm going to Maienfeld in three days.  - Maybe a farmer has a use for her.

59
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,700
毕竟，是个家
Otherwise, it's a home.

60
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,790
但是她这段时间得和你住在一起
But she has to stay with you until then.

61
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,040
到时我带她过来
I'll bring her down then.

62
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,160
照顾你的孙女是你应尽的责任
It's your Christian duty to look after your grandchild.

63
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,540
好了，下来吧
Here, off you go.

64
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,240
爷爷？
Grandfather?

65
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,080
今晚我还睡在畜棚里吗？
Should I sleep in the stable again tonight?

66
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,120
随你睡哪儿
Sleep wherever you want.

67
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,410
你只有一把椅子
You only have one chair.

68
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,620
一张床
And only one bed.

69
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,910
上面是干什么的
What's that up there?

70
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,490
我想睡在上面的干草里，可以吗？
I want to sleep up here in the hay.Am I allowed?

71
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,740
爷爷？
Grandfather?

72
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,240
我不想去别人家
I'd rather not go into a home.

73
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,740
- 早上好，爷爷  - 喝你的牛奶
- Good morning, Grandfather.  - Drink your milk.

74
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,740
停下！
Stop there!  -

75
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,490
早上好，山羊们
Good morning, goats.  -

76
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,160
小熊、小天鹅[羊名]，过来！
Little Bear! Little Swan! Come on!

77
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,540
来吧
Come on! Chop chop!

78
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,620
早上好，牧羊人
Good day, General Goatherd.

79
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,950
今天带女孩和你一起去阿尔卑斯山上去
Take the girl with you out on the alp today.

80
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,700
她不知道山上的事情
She doesn't know how things work in the mountains.

81
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,740
你好，我叫海蒂
Hello. My name is Heidi.

82
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,580
- 好吧  - 谢谢
- Right.  - Thank you.

83
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,790
过来
Come on.

84
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,450
听到他说的了吗？你得听我的话
Did you hear him?You have to do what I say.

85
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,830
好的
Yeah, yeah.

86
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,990
- 你叫什么名字？ - 皮特
- What's your name?  - Peter.

87
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,240
- 你和他一起住吗？ - 是的，他是我爷爷
- Are you living with him now?  - Yes, he's my grandfather.

88
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,910
你爷爷？
Your grandfather?

89
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,790
为什么不和你的父母一起住
Why don't you live with your parents?

90
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,790
他们去世了
Because they're dead.

91
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,240
我父亲也去世了
My father is dead too.

92
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,120
以前我和我的姑姑迪提一起住在拉格斯
I was living with my Aunt Dete in Bad Ragaz until now.

93
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,700
一整天我都得坐在家里
I had to sit inside all day.

94
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,040
这里太好了，我可以出来玩！
But here is much better.I can be outside!

95
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,080
- 跟紧我  - 好的
- Hey, stay with me!  - Yeah, yeah.

96
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,160
那个小的叫什么？
What's that little one called?

97
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,410
- Snowhopper  - 你能教我怎么生火吗？
- Snowhopper.  - Will you show me how to make a fire?

98
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,330
当然可以
Sure.

99
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,200
嘿！皮特
Hey, Peter.

100
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,450
你吃了我的奶酪和香肠吗？
Did you eat some of my cheese and sausage?

101
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,700
什么，我吗？
What, me?

102
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,580
不，不是我
No, that wasn't me.

103
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,910
还能是谁？
Who else could it have been?

104
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,080
不知道，也许是山羊干的？
I don't know. Maybe a goat?

105
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,040
山羊？
A goat?

106
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,580
停下！
Hey! Stay there.

107
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,950
小天鹅，停下
Little Swan, Thistlefinch! Stop it, stop!

108
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,660
走开，停止打斗
Get away! Stop that!

109
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,580
- 待在那里  - 放过他
- Just you wait!  - Leave him!

110
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,200
没听见吗，我让你待在那里
Do you never listen?I said stay over there!

111
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,790
不要打它，它们不打架了
Stop hitting them!They stopped fighting.

112
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,290
需要惩罚它们，因为打架导致产奶少了
They need to be punished.They give less milk if they fight.

113
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:40,290
如果你不打它们，我分一半吃的给你
If you stop hitting them,I'll give you half my food.

114
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,490
一半？
Half of it?

115
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,490
每天？
Every day?

116
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,870
但你不能再打这些山羊
But you're not allowed to hit the goats anymore.

117
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
成交？
Do you promise?

118
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,540
每天，一半
Every day. Half.

119
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,160
- 看到了吗？ - 看到了
- Do you see? Look.  - I can see.

120
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,040
看，快，趴下
Look. Ouick, get down!

121
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,370
该你了
Now your turn.

122
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,040
- 我  - 是的
- Me?  - Yes.

123
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,660
- 海蒂？ - 嗯？
- Heidi?  - Yes?

124
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:43,200
- 不要提食物的事情  - 我不会说的
- Maybe don't mention the food.  - I won't say anything.

125
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:49,160
村里人说他杀过人
In the village they say he killed someone once.

126
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,080
谢谢
Thank you.

127
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,370
我还是睡在畜棚里吧
I'd rather sleep in the stable affer all.

128
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,990
皮特和你讲了我的传闻吗？
Did Peter tell you stories about me?

129
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,080
你相信他的话？
And you just believe him?

130
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,290
他说的是真的吗？
Is it true what he says?

131
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,740
人们喜欢说些鸡毛蒜皮的事情
People like saying nasty things.

132
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,450
你需要决定相信自己的眼睛和耳朵
You have to decide whether to trust your own eyes and ears

133
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,700
还是别人的话
or what other people say.

134
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,830
晚安，爷爷
Goodnight, Grandfather.

135
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,370
好美
Lovely.

136
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,080
我对这里很熟
I know my way around up here.

137
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,740
明天我告诉你雪绒花长在哪
I'll show you tomorrow where the edelweiss grows.

138
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,660
皮特
Peter.

139
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,370
明天我得走了，爷爷要带我去牧师那里
I'll be gone tomorrow.Grandfather is taking me to the parson.

140
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,740
什么？
What?

141
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,080
[其实是舍不得那些吃的了吧！…^_^]
我又要独自和这些愚蠢的山羊呆在一起了
I'm on my own with these stupid goats again.

142
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,830
走开
Shoo! Move! Come on.

143
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,910
走开
Go! Move it!

144
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,290
看你弄成什么样了
What on earth do you look like?

145
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,740
爷爷？
Grandfather?

146
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,870
这是我的椅子？
Is the chair for me?

147
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,580
还能是谁的
Who else?

148
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,120
但我明天要离开了啊
But I'm leaving tomorrow.

149
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,240
你明天要去山上
You're going out on the alp tomorrow.

150
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,040
后天也去？
And the next day too?

151
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,330
当然
Certainly.

152
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,910
不要再问问题了，去洗干净你的脸
Don't ask so many questions and go and wash your face.

153
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,830
谢谢，谢谢，太感谢你了
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

154
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:56,160
皮特，我能留下来了
Peter! I'm allowed to stay!

155
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,200
- 今天是我最后一天来了  - 为什么
- Today is the last day I'll be here.  - Why?

156
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,910
我得去上学
I have to go to school.

157
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,790
什么时候回来？
When are you coming back?

158
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,490
春天吧，我想
In the spring, I think.

159
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,040
直到春天？
Not until the spring?

160
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,660
你可以下山到我家来
You can come down and visit.

161
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,540
我奶奶会很高兴看见你
Grandmother will be pleased to see you.

162
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,330
别吃了，吃的够多了
No more eating, you've had enough!

163
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,660
跟上！
Come on!

164
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,160
我能去上学吗？
May I go to school too?

165
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,580
过来，吃饭
Come on, eat.

166
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,290
看谁来了
Look who's there.

167
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,200
难以置信
That's unbelievable.

168
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,200
他不应该被允许照顾孩子
He shouldn't be allowed to take care of a child.

169
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,740
他看过来啦
He's looking over.

170
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,120
早上好
Good day.

171
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,240
你好
Hello.

172
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,330
阿蒙治叔叔…
Alp-Uncle...

173
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,910
对这个女孩你有什么规划
What do you have planned for the girl?

174
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,950
和你没关系
That's nothing to do with you.

175
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,660
她应该去上学
In a year she'll have to go to school.

176
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,370
她不需要
She doesn't have to do anything.

177
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,740
讲点理，每个孩子都该读书
Be sensible.Every child must learn to read.

178
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,620
她没法在冬天里独自一人从山上下来
She can't come down from the alp on her own in the winter.

179
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,370
过来，孩子，出去玩
Come on, child.You go outside.

180
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,290
整个冬天独自一人呆在山上
Alone the whole winter,up on that alp.

181
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:55,450
- 这么大的孩子需要朋友  - 她应有尽有
- A child of that age needs friends.  - She has all she needs.

182
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,790
这是违法的
It's against the law.

183
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,370
对你的法律不感兴趣
I'm not interested in your laws.

184
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,620
过来
Come on.

185
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,490
老顽固
Such a pig-headed fellow.

186
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,790
看
Here, look.

187
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,330
做好了
It's finished.

188
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,950
好漂亮
Beautiful.

189
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,330
谢谢你，爷爷
Thank you, Grandfather.

190
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,910
要是春天来了就好了
If only it were spring again.

191
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:39,080
快
Faster!

192
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,490
谢谢
Thank you.

193
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,870
天黑后我会来接你
When it gets dark,I'll come and pick you up.

194
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,040
皮特在家吗？
Hello, is Peter there?

195
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,910
他在学校，进来吧
He's at school.But come inside.

196
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,740
母亲，我们有客人来了，是海蒂
Mother, we have a visitor.It's Heidi.

197
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,830
你好
Hello.

198
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,490
孩子，她看不见
Child, she can't see.

199
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,950
靠近点，海蒂
Come a little closer, Heidi.

200
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,370
奶奶，你什么都看不见吗？
Can you see nothing, Grandmother?

201
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,740
是看不见
With my eyes, nothing at all.

202
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,240
但可以用手感受世界
But with my hands,it's different.

203
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,120
- 海蒂  - 皮特
- Heidi!  - Peter!

204
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,540
谢谢
Thank you.

205
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,450
你什么也没错过，学校好无聊
You're not missing anything.School is so boring.

206
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,040
你这样说是因为你不会读书
You just say that because you still can't read.

207
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,620
你也不会，读书有什么好的
You can't either.What good does reading do up here?

208
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:07,950
吃你的饭
Eat your food!

209
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,160
奶奶，吃我的吧
You can have mine, Grandmother.

210
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,330
谢谢，海蒂，它太硬了
Thank you, Heidi,but it's too hard.

211
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:22,160
我快没牙了
I hardly have any teeth left, you know.

212
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,370
那我给我吧
Then I'll take it.

213
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:38,240
奶奶看不见，你知道吗？
Grandmother can't see.Did you know?

214
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,410
她也不能吃陈面包
And she can't eat any stale bread at all.

215
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,620
我们很幸运，不是吗，爷爷
We're lucky, aren't we Grandfather?

216
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,700
噢，那里
Whoa there!

217
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,330
叔叔？你好
Uncle? Hello.

218
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,200
我带来一些好消息
I've got some good news.

219
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:07,790
我帮海蒂找到了好人家
I've found a place for Heidi,

220
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,660
在法兰克福，我雇主的朋友家里
with friends of my employers,in Frankfurt.

221
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,790
这是一个受人尊敬的家庭
It's a well-respected family,

222
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:23,580
海蒂可以和她们的女儿一起去上学
and Heidi could even go to school with their young daughter.

223
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,540
对她来说太好了
It's a wonderful chance for her.

224
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,540
说句话吧
Say something at least!

225
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,870
说完了就滚
When you're finished, you can go.

226
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,910
我想带走她
But I want to take her with me.

227
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,700
海蒂待在这里
Heidi is staying here.

228
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,620
村里人说你不让她上学
In the village they sayyou don't let her go to school.

229
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:48,490
因为你的固执她不会读也不会写
Because of your obstinacy,she won't learn to read or write!

230
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,490
你想让她在这里粗野下去？
You want her to turn wild up here?

231
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,910
你为什么突然这么关心她？
Why do you care about her all of a sudden?

232
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,620
叔叔，上次我也没办法
Uncle, last time I had no other choice.

233
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:00,290
没什么好说的了
There's nothing more to say.

234
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,620
如果你不让她上学
If you don't let her go to school,

235
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:09,160
他们会带走她并把她送到别人家里
they'll take her away from you and put her in a home.

236
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:13,290
我今天要带走她，如果需要的话会寻求村民的帮助
I'm taking her today. With help from the villagers, if needs be.

237
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,870
孩子在哪？
Where is the child?

238
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,290
海蒂是我的
Heidi is mine.

239
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,040
现在滚！
Now get out of here.

240
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,910
- 海蒂  - 迪提？
- Heidi!  - Dete?

241
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,990
- 迪提姑姑  - 海蒂，我的孩子
- Aunt Dete!  - Heidi, my child.

242
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,330
过来
Come here.

243
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,620
想我吗？
Have you missed me lots?

244
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,240
小孩，放你的羊去
Boy, go back to your goats.

245
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:04,950
我和海蒂有话要说
I have to talk to Heidi.Come on.

246
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,450
坐下
Sit down.

247
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,700
听我说
Listen to me.

248
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:19,290
你想住在一个又大又漂亮的房子里吗？
How would you like to live in a big, beautiful house?

249
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,950
泽塞曼一家，来自法兰克福的非常好的人
The Sesemanns,very kind people from Frankfurt,

250
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,740
正在为他们的女儿寻找朋友
are looking for a friend for their daughter.

251
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,620
但我喜欢这里
But I like it here.

252
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,990
但是法兰克福的女孩期待你的到来
But the girl in Frankfurt is so looking forward to you coming.

253
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,450
我还是想和爷爷待在一起
I'd rather stay with Grandfather.

254
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:41,830
海蒂，爷爷让你和我一起走
Heidi, Grandfather wants you to come with me.

255
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,120
真的？
Really?

256
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:50,080
孩子，我们都希望把最好的给你
Child, we both just want what is best for you.

257
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,790
过来，火车快要开了
Come along.The train is leaving soon.

258
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:58,330
- 但我得说再见  - 没时间了
- But I have to say goodbye.  - We don't have any time.

259
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,790
- 远吗？ - 不远
- Is it far away?  - No, no.

260
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,080
如果我不喜欢那里呢
And what if I don't like it?

261
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,620
你可以回来
Then you can come back home.

262
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,790
我保证
I promise.

263
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,410
跟上

264

- 出发吧  - 好的

269
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,540
他们走了，你又晚了，不是吗？
They've gone!You're late again, aren't you?

270
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,410
一直在寻找
Keep looking.

271
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:33,790
孩子还活着真是一个奇迹
It's a miracle the child is still alive.

272
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,200
海蒂，待在这

273
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,330
待在这
Stay here!

274
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,790
海蒂，和我来，跟上

275
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,160
有空吗

276
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,160

00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,410

海蒂，住手
Heidi, stop it!

285
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,990
现在我要向洛特梅尔小姐介绍你，好吗？
I'm introducing you to Miss Rottenmeier now, okay?

286
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,540
她是年轻小姐的家庭教师
That's the young lady's governess.

287
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,740
家庭教师？
Governess?

288
00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:01,160
她是一位非常优秀的女士，现在照顾克拉拉小姐
She's a very distinguished woman who looks affer Miss Klara.

289
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,040
好好表现
So behave yourself!

290
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,790
- 洛特梅尔小姐等着见你们  - 好的，跟上
- Miss Rottenmeier will see you now.  - Right. Come along.

291
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,450
不幸的是，我没时间给她换衣服
Unfortunately, I had no time to change her clothes.

292
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,620
- 你叫什么名字？ - 海蒂
- What is your name?  - Heidi.

293
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,200
海蒂？那不是一个基督徒的名字
Heidi? That's not a Christian name.

294
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,040
她叫艾迪尔海德，像她母亲
Her name is Adelheid, like her mother.

295
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,450
上帝保佑她的灵魂
God rest her soul.

296
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:49,240
孩子在我看来太小
The child seems very young to me.

297
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:52,700
确实，对于她的年纪来说身体有点小
Indeed, she is quite small for her age.

298
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,740
- 我八岁了  - 八岁
- I'm eight.  - Eight.

299
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,700
不，这还不够，跟我过来，迪提
No, that won't do at all.Come with me, Dete.

300
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,950
艾迪尔海德正是泽塞曼先生需要的
Adelheid is exactly what Mr Sesemann wanted.

301
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,660
来自瑞士乡下的孩子
An unspoiled child from the Swiss countryside.

302
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,080
现在给我的报酬吧
And now I want my side of the deal.

303
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,540
- 我该叫你什么？ - 海蒂
- What should I call you?  - Heidi.

304
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,910
我是克拉拉
I'm Klara.

305
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,950
来法兰克福开心吗
Were you excited about Frankfurt?

306
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:30,450
爷爷和迪提姑姑希望我来
Grandfather and Aunt Dete wanted me to come,

307
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,870
但如果我不喜欢，我可以回去
but if I don't like it, I'm allowed to go back home.

308
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,410
你是我见过最好奇的孩子
You're the most curious girl I've ever met.

309
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,370
这是男孩子的衣服吗
Are those boys' clothes?

310
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:44,660
在阿尔卑斯山区这很常见，尤其适合攀爬
It's practical on the alp.Especially for climbing.

311
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,700
噢，攀爬
Oh, climbing...

312
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,040
你不能走路吗？
Can't you walk?

313
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,200
很不幸，不能
No, sadly not.

314
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,370
- 所以你得坐在这上面？ - 是的
- So you always have to sit in this?  - Yes.

315
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,740
随便推我走走吧
Feel free to push me.

316
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,330
喜欢我们的房子吗
How do you like our house?

317
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,830
好大
It's big.

318
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,740
抱歉
I'm sorry.

319
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:21,950
怎么了
What happened?

320
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:26,700
我冲向了桌子，没注意，抱歉
I rode into the table. I wasn't paying attention. I'm sorry.

321
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:35,040
好吧，晚饭时间到了
Right. It's time for supper.

322
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,080
坐吧
Let's sit.

323
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,200
你看起来像皮特一样的牧羊人
You look a bit like Peter the goatherd.

324
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,540
- 请原谅  - 什么？
- Adelheid.  - Adelheid

325
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,660
不要那样和仆人交谈
Don't talk like that to the servants.

326
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,990
这间房子里我们用餐具
In this house we use cutlery.

327
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:16,410
她不知道这些常识
She doesn't even know the very basics.

328
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,950
抱歉，我去拿抹布
Sorry. I'll get a rag.

329
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,410
抹布？
A rag?

330
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,240
坐下，艾迪尔海德！
Sit down, Adelheid!

331
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,040
蒂妮特，安静
Tinette. Silence!

332
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,160
能给我两个吗？
Can I have two?

333
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,990
塞巴斯蒂安
Sebastian.

334
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:53,660
[纠正发音的问题]
他能给我两个面包卷吗？
"Can he please pass me two rolls?"

335
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,120
他能给…我两个面包卷吗？
Can he please... give me two rolls?

336
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,200
递给我两个面包卷
"Pass me two rolls."

337
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,040
递给我两个面包卷
Pass me two rolls.

338
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:08,410
两卷
Two rolls.

339
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,080
两卷，请
Two rolls, please.

340
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,040
艾迪尔海德，在这房子里有些规矩
In this house there are rules, Adelheid.

341
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,830
提到仆人时你要说他或者她
You are to refer to the servants as 'he' or 'she',

342

343
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:33,120
早餐是七点半

344
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:37,830
八点十五分开始上课
Lessons will take place in the study and commence at 8:15.

345
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,950
十二点半午餐
At 12:30 we take our lunch.

346
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:43,580
两小时午休
Then two hours of rest.

347
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,700
晚上七点上床睡觉
At 7 it's bed time.

348
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,870
房间里禁止奔跑，跳跃
In this house there is no running, hopping or jumping.

349
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:52,200
我们一直步行
We always walk.

350
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,450
从不大声说话
We never raise our voices.

351
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,290
洛特梅尔小姐？
Miss Rottenmeier?

352
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:04,580
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

353
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:11,080
你不能像这样来回奔跑
You can't run around here like that.

354
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,410
- 我？ - 是的！
- Me?  - Yes!

355
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:31,540
山上的人都不洗澡吗？
Don't people wash up in the mountains?

356
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,080
不，我们洗
Yes, we do.

357
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,870
我听说在山上
I have heard that up there,

358
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:45,120
有巨人和侏儒
there are mountain trolls and gnomes.

359
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,120
你见过吗？
Have you ever seen one?

360
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:49,450
别动
Stay still.

361
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:00,950
穿上鞋子，准备好的话就上楼
Now put those on, and when you're ready, come upstairs.

362
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:20,040
海蒂
Heidi!

363
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:37,080
不，黄油刀
No, the butter knife.

364
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,700
好的，艾迪尔海德小姐
Okay, Miss Adelheid.

365
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:52,790
打开书本至第一章并朗读
Open the book at chapter one and read aloud.

366
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:05,660
我不会
I can't.

367
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,830
什么？
Pardon?

368
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,200
我不会读
I can't read.

369
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,410
你应该认识字母
You must know the letters.

370
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,870
这是哪个字母？
Which letter is this?

371
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:19,740
看起来像是座山
It's like a mountain.

372
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:22,540
是的，它是
Yes, it is.

373
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:24,660
克拉拉小姐，这不好笑
Miss Klara, this is not funny.

374
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,700
皮特也不会读书
Peter can't read either.

375
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:29,040
- 皮特？ - 皮特？
- Peter?  - Peter?

376
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,490
他是我的朋友
He's my friend.

377
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:34,950
皮特说我们山上不需要这个
Peter said we don't need to up on the alp.

378
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,490
不需要？
You don't need to?

379
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,080
小姐…
Miss...

380
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,910
每个人都应该也必须学会朗读
Every person can and must learn to read.

381
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:47,790
失陪一会
Please excuse me one moment.

382
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,080
她不认识字母表？
She doesn't know the alphabet?

383
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:58,740
粗野没教养的家伙不应该带进我们的房子
A completely wild, uneducated creature has been brought into our house.

384
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:03,660
也许她应该有个单独的老师
Maybe it would be appropriate for her to have a separate teacher.

385
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:05,660
你这么想？
You'd like that.

386
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:07,330
不可能在进行克拉拉小姐
It can't be asking too much

387
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:11,290
的课程时同时教这个瑞士孩子字母表
to teach the Swiss child the alphabet alongside Klara's lesson.

388
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:13,290
当然不行，我只是想
Certainly not, I just thought...

389
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:18,330
一旦泽塞曼先生回来，我相信艾迪尔海德得离开这里
As soon as Mr Sesemann returns, I'll ensure Adelheid leaves this house.

390
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,580
窗户打不开吗？
Doesn't this window open?

391
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,040
为什么？
Why?

392
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,830
我想试试看能否看到大山
I want to find out if you can see the mountains.

393
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:38,330
艾迪尔海德小姐，能回到自己的座位吗？
Miss Adelheid, would you be so kind as to retake your seat

394
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:42,240
这样我们可以继续我们的课程
so that we can continue with the much-needed lesson?

395
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:45,740
克拉拉小姐
Miss Klara.

396
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,370
艾迪尔海德小姐，这个山叫做A
Miss Adelheid, the mountain is called 'A'.

397
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,330
艾迪尔海德的A
'A' for Adelheid.

398
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,950
- 对  - “A”
- Exactly.  - 'A'.

399
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:03,870
推我过去，海蒂
Take me over there, Heidi.

400
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:14,830
不要拉开这么大，不要被人发现
Not so wide! We don't want to be seen.

401
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:22,990
我想让你看看这个
I wanted to show you this.

402
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:26,870
- 是你吗？ - 和我的母亲一起
- Is that you?  - And my mother.

403
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,950
但是你是站立的
But you're standing up.

404
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,580
是的
Yes.

405
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,370
我生病了在
I only became ill affer...

406
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,870
我母亲去世后
Affer she died.

407
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,370
父亲也想她
Father misses her too.

408
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:45,370
他经常因工作出去
He's always travelling for his work.

409
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,740
我一直被困在这间房子里
And I'm always stuck in this house.

410
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,080
你！
You!

411
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:07,580
上帝啊，年轻女士不会这样悄悄移动
Goodness me! Young ladies don't creep up like that.

412
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:08,790
抱歉
Sorry.

413
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,910
现在是午休时间，艾迪尔海德小姐
It's nap time, Miss Adelheid.

414
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,790
我睡不着
But I can't sleep.

415
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:17,410
不是睡觉，只是休息
You shouldn't sleep, just rest.

416
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:24,040
需要我做些什么，年轻的女士
How can I be of service to the young lady?

417
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:26,950
你能
Do you...

418
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,040
他知道怎样打开窗户吗
Does he know how to open the window?

419
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:31,410
哪一扇
Which one?

420
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,120
好了，小姐[法语]
Here, mademoiselle.

421
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:48,120
小心，不要这么远
Good gracious, not so far!

422
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,790
根本看不见山
There are no mountains at all.

423
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:57,290
好吧，从这里你不会看见任何山
Well, you can't see any from up here,

424
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:03,240
但是，看，在那个塔上你能看的更远
but look,you can see much further from the tower.

425
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:11,160
现在我得关上窗户，年轻的女士得回她的房间
But now I have to close the window again and the young lady goes to her room.

426
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:13,160
否则会有麻烦了
Otherwise there'll be trouble.

427
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,240
谢谢你，再见
Thank you and adieu.

428
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:23,290
再见
Adieu.

429
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,830
我们得在午休结束前回来
We have to be back before the afternoon rest is over.

430
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,580
当然
Sure.

431
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:41,540
右边
Right.

432
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,450
不，左边
No, left!

433
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:48,160
对了，这边
That's right. Along there.

434
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,660
苹果，新鲜的苹果
Apples, fresh apples!

435
00:49:57,950 --> 00:49:59,950
新鲜的苹果
Fresh apples!

436
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,540
塔
The tower.

437
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:26,080
现在在哪儿？
Where is it now?

438
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,790
海蒂，我不知道
Heidi, I don't know right now.

439
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:34,120
也许他知道
Maybe he knows.

440
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:37,240
海蒂，你不能同乞丐说话
Heidi, you can't talk to a beggar!

441
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,740
海蒂
Heidi!

442
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:44,830
这边
This way.

443
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,080
就在那儿
There it is.

444
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,620
面包，新鲜的面包
Bread! Fresh bread!

445
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:10,950
新鲜的面包
Fresh bread!

446
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,240
这儿，从这里进去吧
There. That's where you go in.

447
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,040
你呢？
What about you?

448
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:19,370
别管我，快上去
Don't worry about me. Go on, hurry!

449
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,580
去
Go!

450
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,830
我希望小姐休息好了
I hope miss is well rested.

451
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:44,870
小姐？
Miss?

452
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:06,290
我想年轻的女士会喜欢这个
I'm sure the young lady will like this.

453
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,200
好可爱
How cute.

454
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,450
只花一点点钱
If you have a few pennies...

455
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,830
不要站在那儿，去找
Don't just stand there. Search!

456
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,830
小姐？
Miss?

457
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:22,990
艾迪尔海德
Adelheid!

458
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,200
克拉拉
Klara!

459
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,410
找不到他们
I can't find them.

460
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,330
前门开着
The front door was open.

461
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,160
- 然后呢？ - 也许她们出去了
- And?  - Maybe they went out.

462
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:33,700
好吧，为什么出去，去哪儿了？
Oh, right. Why out? Where?

463
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,290
我想我们得出去找她们
I think we should look for them outside.

464
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:37,700
天啊
Good God!

465
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:41,990
塞巴斯蒂安，找到那些孩子
Find the children, Sebastian.

466
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:43,490
找到她们
Find them!

467
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:57,040
山在哪儿？
Where are the mountains?

468
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,160
爷爷
Grandfather.

469
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:35,160
海蒂，怎么样了？
Heidi, how was it?

470
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,330
卢克
Look.

471
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:40,700
它们好可爱
They're so sweet.

472
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:42,450
我们得走了
We have to go.

473
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,660
快点
Come on!

474
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,790
小姐
Miss!

475
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,040
你在干什么
What do you think you're doing?

476
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,830
尽快回去
Back to the house, quick as you can.

477
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,080
她们到底去哪了
Where on earth were they?

478
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,790
不远，她们只是想去
Not far.They just wanted to...

479
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,080
- 呼吸点新鲜空气  - 对
- Get some fresh air.  - Exactly.

480
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:24,410
你把克拉拉带出了这间屋子
You took Klara out of this house.

481
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,120
你知道这有多危险吗？
Are you aware of how dangerous that is?

482
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:28,330
什么
What...

483
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:38,040
如果出了什么事怎么和她父亲交代
What would you have told her father if something had happened to her?

484
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:45,660
你的腰带…
And your sash is all...

485
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,450
天啊，这些小东西必须出去
Oh, goodness! Those creatures must go.

486
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:55,830
- 不！  - 塞巴斯蒂安
- No...  - Sebastian!

487
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,490
- 不能留下它们吗？ - 当然不行
- Can't we keep them?  - Absolutely not!

488
00:54:58,790 --> 00:54:59,990
我…
I...

489
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:02,620
我无法呼吸，猫毛
I can't breathe. The fur!

490
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,330
天啊
Oh God!

491
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,950
弄走它们
Get them away!

492
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:10,740
这些东西必须弄走
Those creatures must go!

493
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:14,950
快点，塞巴斯蒂安
Hurry up. Ouickly, Sebastian!

494
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:20,410
- 我会照顾这些小东西  - 我无法呼吸
- I'll look affer these little mites.  - I can't breathe.

495
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:24,040
天啊，抓住那里的那只，快
Oh my god, take that one there!Hurry up!

496
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:25,990
塞巴斯蒂安，我的天
Sebastian! Oh God.

497
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:29,580
塞巴斯蒂安，猫，它在攻击我
Sebastian! The cat! It's attacking me!

498
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:55,700
不
No.

499
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:59,120
艾迪尔海德今晚没有晚饭吃
Adelheid will have no supper this evening.

500
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:01,120
- 但…  - 泽塞曼小姐
- But...  - Miss Sesemann.

501
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:04,540
改由大人们来决定怎样抚养小孩
It is for adults to decide how children are brought up.

502
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,490
站在那里
Stand over there.

503
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:15,660
面对墙壁
With your face to the wall.

504
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,410
动起来
Get a move on!

505
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,910
面对墙壁
With your face to the wall.

506
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:47,540
面对墙壁，我说了
With your face to the wall, I said!

507
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,120
下次我会把你和老鼠一起关在笼子里
Next time I'll lock you in the cellar with the rats.

508
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:44,580
我要回家
I have to go home.

509
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,450
什么？
Pardon me?

510
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:48,740
什么？
What?

511
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:51,370
海蒂
Heidi!

512
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:53,330
我只是想
I just have to.

513
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:56,580
但是…
But...

514
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:59,450
- 但是为什么，海蒂  - 艾迪尔海德
- But why? Heidi!  - Adelheid

515
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,290
停在那儿
Stop right there.

516
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:03,330
海蒂，等等
Heidi, wait!

517
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,660
- 我说了停下  - 海蒂
- I said stop!  - Heidi!

518
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:07,870
不要走
Don't go!

519
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,200
你怎么敢
How dare you!

520
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,160
迪提说了我可以随时离开
Dete said I can leave when I want.

521
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,660
她说了吗？
Did she really?

522
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:16,540
她骗了你，你无法离开
Then she lied. There's no way you're leaving.

523
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:21,040
你难道不知道你有多幸运吗
Don't you know how lucky you are?

524
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,200
我多么希望我在这样的家庭长大
I wish I had grown up in such a house.

525
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,740
带这么多面包卷你想干什么
What did you want to do with those rolls?

526
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:34,200
为了奶奶
They're for Grandmother.

527
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:36,080
愚蠢的孩子
You stupid child.

528
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:38,580
丢下它们
Leave them there.

529
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:41,370
海蒂，你在干什么
Heidi, what are you doing?

530
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:48,240
瞧你对千金小姐做了什么
Look what you're doing to the young lady.

531
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:57,620
回你的房间
Now go to your room.

532
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,490
现在
Right this second.

533
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,660
蒂妮特
Tinette.

534
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:08,120
蒂妮特
Tinette!

535
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,240
爷爷
Grandfather.

536
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,870
克拉拉在哪
Where is Klara?

537
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,620
她病了
She's ill.

538
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:10,870
病了，都怪你
Sick! Because of you.

539
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:40,040
哦，我们的小瑞士女孩来了
So, here's our little Swiss girl.

540
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:43,990
不要害怕，我只是个医生
Don't be scared. I'm just the doctor.

541
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,040
- 嗨  - 嗨？
- Hiya.  - Hiya?

542
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,330
嗨
Hiya.

543
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,700
克拉拉病了吗
Is Klara sick?

544
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,870
她现在好多了
The young lady is much better.

545
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,490
我想她会很高兴见到你
I think she'll be pleased to see you.

546
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,830
再见
Goodbye.

547
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,540
再见
Adieu.

548
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,490
我是如此的糟糕以至于你想离开吗
Am I so awful I make you want to leave?

549
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:13,410
不，不是因为那个
No, that's not it.

550
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:24,910
我只有你，海蒂
I only have you, Heidi.

551
01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:28,830
我们能够一起度过一段美好时光
We could have such a nice time together.

552
01:01:38,290 --> 01:01:39,830
“N”！
'N'.

553
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,120
- 你现在应该快点  - “O”
- You should be a little faster by now.  - 'O'.

554
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:53,950
看起来像面包卷
It looks like a bread roll.

555
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:57,410
确实像
Exactly.

556
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:00,490
它不是“tread”的“T”
It's not a 'T' for tread,

557
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:02,200
或者“kread”的“K”
or a 'K' for kread,

558
01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:05,490
只是个“B…bread”的“B”
but a 'B'... A 'B' for bread.

559
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:07,580
以一个“B”开始
And that starts with a...

560
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:11,830
你到底怎么了，你忘了吗？
'B'! What's wrong with you? How have you forgotten?

561
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:37,200
你打扮的真漂亮
You've really dolled yourself up.

562
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:40,950
我根本没有打扮自己，你怎敢[这样说]！
I haven't dolled myself up at all. How dare you!

563
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,240
- 欢迎回来，先生  - 塞巴斯蒂安
- Welcome home, sir.  - Sebastian.

564
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:09,410
- 亲爱的  - 很高兴见到你，泽塞曼夫人
- My dear!  - Nice to have you here, Mrs Sesemann.

565
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:17,490
- 爸爸  - 克拉拉，我的孩子
- Father!  - Klara, my child.

566
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:21,490
- 我亲爱的孩子  - 太好了，爸爸
- My darling child!  - How wonderful, father.

567
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:27,410
啊，你是我们的艾迪尔海德？
Ah, so this is our Adelheid?

568
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,160
日安
Good day.

569
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:33,370
我有个惊喜给你
I have a surprise for you.

570
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:40,620
- 奶奶  - 克拉拉
- Grandmama!  - Klara.

571
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:46,200
我的乖乖孙女
My sweet, sweet girl.

572
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:50,700
我只是路过，但我必须见见你
I'm only passing through,but I had to see you.

573
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:53,450
让我看看你
Let me look at you.

574
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:55,330
你看起来很好
You look very well!

575
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:57,870
而且
And...

576
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:00,790
日安，夫人
Good day, medeme.

577
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,240
夫人
Madame.

578
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:04,580
瞎说
Poppycock!

579
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:06,870
叫我奶奶
Just call me Grandmama.

580
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,870
我们幸运能找到一个克拉拉的朋友
We were right to find a friend for Klara.

581
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:18,740
她好多了，很开心
She's much better, so cheerful.

582
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:22,950
恐怕我的消息会让你失望
I'm afraid my news will dampen your spirits somewhat.

583
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:27,200
在我看来，艾迪尔海德表现的…
In my opinion, Adelheid shows signs of...

584
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:31,490
我没有办法教育好她
There's no other way for me to put it...

585
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:33,330
她有点不对劲
...not being in her right mind.

586
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:37,120
不对劲
Not in her right mind?

587
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:40,290
- 什么意思  - 她不会朗读
- What do you mean?  - Adelheid still can't read.

588
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,740
她甚至不认识字母
She can't even recognise the letters,

589
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:47,330
即使教书先生尽他所能
even though Mr Kandidat is doing the very best he can.

590
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,290
这严重影响了克拉拉小姐的学习
This is seriously disrupting Miss Klara's lessons.

591
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:57,950
她的行为是不合适的，相当狂野
And her behaviour is impossible,downright wild.

592
01:04:58,830 --> 01:05:02,370
好吧，我得拿个主意了
Well, well.I'm going to make up my own mind.

593
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:06,040
然后我们要对此负责
And then we'll take it from there.

594
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:19,370
当年轻的牧羊人在晚上数他的羊时
"When the young shepherd counted his sheep in the evening,

595
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:23,700
他发现最小的不见了
he realised that the smallest one was missing."

596
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:25,240
去哪了呢？
"Where could it be?"

597
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:29,740
外面开始下雪，刮起了寒风
"Outside it began to snow and an icy wind blew."

598
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:32,790
我和皮特曾今遇到过这样的情况
That happened to me and Peter once.

599
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:34,330
我们丢失了一只山羊
We lost a goat.

600
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:39,040
- 后来找到了吗？ - 是的，谢天谢地
- Did you find it again?  - Yes. Thankfully.

601
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,660
你从哪来
There, where you come from...

602
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:46,990
我想一定和这里不同，我说的对吗？
I'm sure it's very different to here.Am I right?

603
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,200
故事接下来怎么了
How does the story continue?

604
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:00,830
请告诉我
Please.

605
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:05,620
天越来越黑，雪花夹杂在空气中
"It got darker and darker and the snowflakes whirled through the air."

606
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:08,830
但是突然
"But all of a sudden

607
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:13,540
他听到了小羊的微弱心跳
he heard the very quiet bleating of a little sheep."

608
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:19,450
好吧，我就读到这儿
Right, that's where I'm stopping.

609
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:24,160
但是小羊，他找到了吗？
But the little sheep. Does he find it?

610
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:26,830
你可以自己读这一段
You can read that for yourself.

611
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:29,540
但我不会啊
But I can't.

612
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:31,450
为什么不会呢
Why ever not?

613
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:34,740
皮特说我们不需要朗读
Peter said we don't have to read.

614
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:37,490
皮特说的，是吗？
Peter did, did he?

615
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:41,620
你不能总是相信别人说的话
You don't always have to believe what other people say.

616
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:47,410
如果你能够阅读，你会知道故事接下来的情节
If you could read you would know how the story continues.

617
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:53,240
然后你会喜欢上这个故事，不是吗？
And you like stories, don't you?

618
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:54,740
是的
Yes.

619
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:56,410
那么，这样
Well, then.

620
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:00,080
这本书我留给你
I'll leave the book there for you.

621
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:22,910
海蒂是一个可爱并且极其敏感的孩子
Heidi is a sweet and incredibly sensitive child.

622
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,910
我相信如果给予正确的引导她会学会阅读
I'm sure she can learn to read if given the right attention.

623
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:29,330
太好了
Thank goodness for that.

624
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:33,240
但是我想她的内心并不快乐
But I get the impression that she's not very happy.

625
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,990
她应有尽有
She has all she could want.

626
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:38,580
是内心深处的一些东西
It's something deep inside.

627
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:45,870
住在这间屋子有违她的本性
Living in this house goes against everything she is.

628
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:50,870
克拉拉从没有这么快乐
Klara has never been so happy.

629
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:52,330
我知道
I see.

630
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:56,990
同时它也让你对独自留下克拉拉不再感到愧疚
And it stops you feeling guilty about leaving Klara alone.

631
01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:02,910
胡说
Poppycock.

632
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:03,620
嗯？
Hello?

633
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,660
蒂妮特
Tinette.

634
01:09:11,290 --> 01:09:14,040
你在做什么，手里拿的什么
What are you doing?What's in your hand?

635
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,910
有鬼，听到了吗？
A ghost! Don't you hear it?

636
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:19,040
- 没有鬼这玩意  - 有，听
- There's no such thing as ghosts.  - There is! Listen.

637
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:36,370
塞巴斯蒂安？救命啊，有鬼
Sebastian? Help! A ghost!

638
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,490
没丢东西吧
Nothing was stolen?

639
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:08,450
我亲自检查了银器三次
I checked the silver myself three times over.

640
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:10,740
我锁了门
And I locked the door.

641
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:12,410
我确定
I promise.

642
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:15,040
肯定是鬼
It was a ghost, definitely.

643
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,990
胡说，蒂妮特，荒唐
Poppycock, Tinette. What rot!

644
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:26,700
塞巴斯蒂安，你是个聪明人，你肯定有答案
Sebastian, you're a sensible man. You must have an explanation.

645
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,740
好吧，我必须承认
Well, I have to admit

646
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:32,580
如果是主人问我
that if Sir is asking me,

647
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:36,410
可以肯定的说事情发生的
then it certainly has to be said that things are happening,

648
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:38,450
嗯
that, well...

649
01:10:39,790 --> 01:10:41,660
怎么说呢
that are somewhat, how shall I put it,

650
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:43,700
事情变得有点灵异
that appear somewhat supernatural.

651
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:47,160
- 灵异？ - 是的
- Supernatural?  - Yes.

652
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:49,080
好吧，接下来
Right, then.

653
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:51,540
嗯
Well...

654
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:55,830
我会制止这些愚蠢的行动
I'm going to put a stop to all these carryings-on.

655
01:10:57,370 --> 01:11:01,160
不要让孩子们听到任何关于这件事的消息
Please make sure that the children hear nothing about this.

656
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:03,990
晚安
Goodnight.

657
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:07,290
- 睡觉吧  - 晚安
- To bed.  - Goodnight.

658
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:33,540
在
In... the...

659
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,370
山
vall...

660
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:42,950
谷里
ey...

661
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,330
在山谷里
"In the valley."

662
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:48,700
在山谷里，有条
"In the valley, there flowed

663
01:11:49,790 --> 01:11:53,870
小溪流淌着
a small stream

664
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:57,080
在澄净的水里
and in the clear water

665
01:11:57,250 --> 01:12:00,290
能看到鳟鱼在游动
you could see the trout swimming."

666
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:02,870
好样的，海蒂，我就知道你办得到
Yes! Heidi, I knew you could do it.

667
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:04,540
- 我就知道  - 太好了
- I knew it.  - Superb.

668
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:10,790
谁能想得到？
Who would have thought it?

669
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:15,160
鱼多的使小河看起来银光闪闪
"The fish glittered silver,

670
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:20,080
鱼儿们嬉闹着前进
and frolicked around playfully."

671
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:25,490
在这个美丽的地方
"Here at this lov... lovely place,

672
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:28,410
牧羊人想休息一下
the shepherd wanted to rest

673
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:32,870
吃完他的午餐
and eat his midday meal."

674
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,370
好样的，她做到了
Yes, she can do it!

675
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:37,740
- 我太高兴了，奶奶  - 好样的，海蒂
- I'm so pleased, Grandmama.  - Bravo, bravo, Heidi!

676
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:45,540
每个孩子都能学会朗读只有有个好老师和一些耐心
Every child can learn to read with a good teacher and some patience.

677
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:49,870
海蒂，我很高心
Heidi, I'm delighted.

678
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:53,660
我们的小瑞士女孩看起来做的很好
Our little Swiss girl seems to be doing well here.

679
01:12:55,450 --> 01:12:57,290
这也是为什么
And that's why...

680
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:01,450
她能够和我们待在一起
she should stay with us.

681
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:03,290
- 永远？ - 是的
- Forever?  - Yes.

682
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:06,450
是的，我的孩子，永远
Yes, my child, forever.

683
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:45,870
- 再见，母亲  - 再见
- Goodbye, Mother.  - Goodbye.

684
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,950
驾…
Giddy up!

685
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:31,490
你能待多久，我的朋友
How long can you stay, friend?

686
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:35,830
生意一结束我就得离开
I'll leave as soon as this business is cleared up.

687
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:40,370
今晚我希望能亲眼见到鬼魂
I hope to see the ghost for myself tonight.

688
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:43,450
我的第一次啊
It would be my first.

689
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:29,410
孩子！
Child!

690
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:34,990
你到底在干什么？
What on earth are you doing here?

691
01:15:35,870 --> 01:15:39,200
不要碰她，你不应该弄醒梦游者
Don't touch her!You shouldn't wake sleepwalkers.

692
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:14,790
她快冻僵了
She's freezing cold.

693
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:17,580
能再拿条毯子来吗？
Could you bring another blanket?

694
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,870
地上是什么
What on earth...

695
01:16:31,370 --> 01:16:32,580
给
Here.

696
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:34,740
让我们两单独待在一起
Please leave us two alone.

697
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,490
不要害怕，海蒂
Don't be scared, Heidi.

698
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:48,160
是我，那个医生
It's me, the doctor.

699
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:52,740
你梦到了什么
Were you dreaming?

700
01:16:54,450 --> 01:16:56,700
爷爷
About Grandfather.

701
01:16:58,950 --> 01:17:00,790
你哪里不舒服？
Are you in any pain?

702
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:03,580
只有这里
No, only here.

703
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:05,620
好疼
This hurts.

704
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:11,870
亲爱的孩子，你为什么存着这些面包卷
My dear child,why did you save all those bread rolls?

705
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:17,120
它们是为奶奶准备的，她不能吃硬面包
They're for Grandmother.She can't eat hard bread anymore.

706
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,620
你想家了，小海蒂
You miss your home, little Heidi.

707
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:36,990
来！
Come on.

708
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:39,950
这里
There, there.

709
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:42,240
会好起来的
Everything will be okay.

710
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:51,160
思乡病？
Homesick, you say?

711
01:17:51,330 --> 01:17:54,120
女孩病了，她从来没有平静过
The Swiss illness.Her nerves are in quite a state.

712
01:17:54,290 --> 01:17:57,160
要立刻送她回去
She must be sent home immediately.

713
01:17:57,330 --> 01:17:59,830
- 不行  - 必须送她走
- She can't.  - She must!

714
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:06,080
我不能这样对克拉拉
I can't do that to Klara. Please.

715
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:08,200
尽你所能，好吗？
Do all you can, okay?

716
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:11,660
我已经给出了我的建议
I've given you my advice.

717
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:41,910
你看到了鬼魂吗？
So? Did you see the ghost?

718
01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:45,040
我什么也没说
I didn't say anything.

719
01:18:45,330 --> 01:18:47,700
告诉我一切，爸爸
Tell me everything, Father. Please!

720
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:51,200
克拉拉
Klara.

721
01:18:52,290 --> 01:18:53,450
鬼魂
The ghost...

722
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:55,950
是我们的小海蒂

723
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:57,290
海蒂？
-Heidi?

724
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:59,990
因为痛苦她梦游
She sleepwalks because she's suffering.

725
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,660
- 她需要什么  - 她的家

726
01:19:07,290 --> 01:19:10,290
所以，亲爱的，海蒂不能待在这里了
So, my dear child, Heidi cannot stay here.

727
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:12,830
但是她应该，你不能这样做
But she has to.You can't do that!

728
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:16,290
请不要这样，没有海蒂我该怎么办
Please don't! What will I do without Heidi?

729
01:19:16,450 --> 01:19:20,330
- 海蒂病了，如果想治愈只能…  - 我要她留在这儿
- Heidi's illness will only be cured...  - I want her to stay here!

730
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:23,330
- 我也病了而且一直独自一人  - 克拉拉
- I'm sick and all alone too!  - Klara.

731
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:29,160
你失控了，冷静下来
You're forgetting yourself.Calm down this instant!

732
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:32,990
走吧
Just go!

733
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:35,990
去找你的爷爷和皮特，所有人，走吧
Go to your grandfather and Peter.Everyone, just leave!

734
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:42,410
蒂妮特，送我回房间
Tinette, take me to my room right away.

735
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:51,950
艾迪尔海德

736
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,990
塞巴斯蒂安今天会送你回家

744
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:18,790
能把这个交给克拉拉吗？

745
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:25,490
她应该来看我

780
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:26,540
亲爱的克拉拉
Dear Klara,

781
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:30,240
村子现在被厚厚的大雪覆盖
the village is now under thick snow.

782
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:34,120
所有东西都是白的并且闪闪发亮
Everything is white and sparkling.

783
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:38,450
我们被迫搬到村子里住
We have moved into the village

784
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:40,620
所以我可以去上学了
so that I can go to school.

785
01:26:42,910 --> 01:26:46,870
在学校，男孩坐在一边，女孩们坐在另一边
At school, boys sit on one side and girls on the other.

786
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:50,830
我们的牧师比教书先生还严厉
Our pastor is much stricter than Mr Kandidat.

787
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,370
有时甚至会鞭笞学生
Sometimes there are even canings.

788
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:58,080
可怜的皮特nal由于迟到经常被惩罚
And poor Peter is always punished because he's always late.

789
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:01,410
现在告诉我长大后你想干什么
Now tell me what you want to be when you grow up.

790
01:27:02,330 --> 01:27:03,790
牧羊人
A goatherd.

791
01:27:07,830 --> 01:27:10,120
- 农民  - 农民
- A farmer.  - Farmer.

792
01:27:12,790 --> 01:27:14,910
铁匠，像我父亲一样
A blacksmith. Like my father.

793
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:16,580
铁匠

794
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:26,790
我想写故事
I want to write stories.

795
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:29,240
安静
Ouiet!

796
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:31,080
我知道了
I see.

797
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:32,580
这个字母是？
What letter is this?

798
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:35,240
- “A”？ - 这是“D”
- 'A'?  - A letter 'D'!

799
01:27:35,410 --> 01:27:38,240
几乎每天放学后
Almost every day after school,

800
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:40,580
我都要教皮特朗读
I try to teach poor Peter to read.

801
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:42,950
皮特，昨天刚学过啊
Oh Peter, you did this yesterday.

802
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:45,160
现在就不会了
But it's not really working.

803
01:27:57,620 --> 01:28:00,740
克拉拉，我想你了
Oh Klara, I miss you so much.

804
01:28:00,910 --> 01:28:02,830
我每天都在想你
I think about you every day.

805
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:05,410
请给我写信
Please write to me.

806
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:11,490
我最期待的是你能来看我
"There's nothing I wish for more than for you to come and visit me."

807
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:15,370
你的，海蒂
"Yours, Heidi."

808
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:18,870
我甚至没有说再见
I didn't even say goodbye.

809
01:28:53,290 --> 01:28:56,450
我的天啊！我的天啊，是克拉拉
I don't believe it. I don't believe it. It's Klara!

810
01:28:56,620 --> 01:29:00,290
皮特，皮特，皮特！
Peter, Peter, Peter!

811
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:04,870
皮特，看，是克拉拉，我最亲爱的朋友，克拉拉
Peter, look! It's Klara.My dearest friend! Klara!

812
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:12,660
- 克拉拉  - 海蒂
- Klara!  - Heidi!

813
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:18,790
- 海蒂，我太想你了  - 我也想你
- Heidi, I missed you so much.  - I missed you too.

814
01:29:20,370 --> 01:29:23,660
- 奶奶  - 海蒂
- Grandmama!  - Heidi!

815
01:29:25,330 --> 01:29:28,660
我的乖孩子
My dear child.

816
01:29:56,790 --> 01:30:00,040
看，克拉拉的情况相当糟糕
You see, Klara was in such an awful way,

817
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:03,040
我决定带她来这里
I resolved to bring her here.

818
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:08,700
她能在这里待一段时间吗？
Do you think she could stay here for a few days?

819
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:11,580
当然，会付钱的
For a fee, of course.

820
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,450
克拉拉是我们的客人
Klara is our guest.

821
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:41,290
- 好的  - 确定？
- Okay.  - Sure?

822
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,330

823
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:16,040
海蒂，你得帮我穿衣服
Heidi, you have to help me get dressed.

824
01:31:23,370 --> 01:31:26,290
- 你不需要这个  - 海蒂

825
01:31:27,290 --> 01:31:29,240
一件也不需要
Or any of this either.

826
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:31,370
看，我也不需要它们
Look.I don't need them either.

827

海蒂，不要太快

小熊、小天鹅[山羊名]

829
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,910
它们和我想的一样
They're just like I imagined.

830
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,290
皮特，过来啊

831
01:31:58,950 --> 01:32:01,660
皮特，看，这是克拉拉

832
01:32:03,790 --> 01:32:05,830
克拉拉，这是皮特

833
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:07,990
你好，百闻不如一见
Hello.I've heard so much about you.

834
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:10,450
你来吗？

835
01:32:12,290 --> 01:32:14,990
- 不  - 为什么，让我们和他一起去
- No.  - Why? Let's go with him.

836
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:17,540
怎么可能，你无法走路
How will that work?You can't walk.

837
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:20,450
- 皮特  - 来吧，我们走

- 看到了吗  - 星星在闪耀
- Did you see that?  - Yes, a shooting star.

849
01:33:59,330 --> 01:34:01,200
现在让我们许愿吧
Now we can wish for something.

850
01:34:03,410 --> 01:34:04,990
- 我希望…  - 不
- I wish that…  - No!

851
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:07,870
不要说出来
You're not allowed to say.

852
01:35:20,290 --> 01:35:21,330
该死的
Damn!

853
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,580
走吧，山羊
Come on, goats!

854
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:48,740
轮椅在哪儿，海蒂，轮椅去哪了
Where is the wheelchair? Heidi, where is it?

855
01:35:52,290 --> 01:35:53,830
不在这儿
It's not here.

856
01:35:56,660 --> 01:35:58,580
也不在这儿
It's not here either.

857
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:02,120
它不可能这样消失
It can't just disappear.

858
01:36:03,620 --> 01:36:06,910
- 爷爷，它不见了  - 什么？轮椅不见了
- Grandfather, it's not here.  - What? It's gone?

859
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:10,540
不可能，你四处找过了吗
Impossible.Did you look everywhere?

860
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:14,330
现在我得在这儿坐一整天什么也干不了
Now I have to sit here all day and can't do anything.

861
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:17,240
爷爷会想出办法的
Grandfather will think of something.

862
01:36:20,450 --> 01:36:22,660
我要好好教训他一顿
He'll be getting a piece of my mind.

863
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:52,870
小熊[山羊名]
Little Bear?

864
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:08,410
谢谢你
Thank you.

865
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:10,830
待在这儿
There you go.

866
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:26,410
我知道你做了什么，小子
I know what you did, General Goatherd.

867
01:37:27,790 --> 01:37:31,160
你的坏行为会受到惩罚的
Your bad conscience is probably punishment enough.

868
01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:40,620
在我晚上回来前好好照看女孩们
Now look affer the girls until I come back in the evening.

869
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:43,200
懂我的意思吗？
Do you understand me?

870
01:37:51,790 --> 01:37:54,200
- 我去找皮特  - 好的，去吧
- I'll go and get Peter.  - Yes, do.

871
01:38:03,450 --> 01:38:04,540
出来
Come out.

872
01:38:07,370 --> 01:38:09,040
不要
I don't want to.

873
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:11,740
那好吧
Then don't.

874
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:15,200
只要这儿有吃的他就会马上出来
He'll come for sure. As soon as there's food.

875
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:17,990
好美
They're beautiful.

876
01:38:18,620 --> 01:38:22,450
- 就像你说的  - 看吧，你现在就在这里
- It's just like you said.  - See? And now you're here.

877
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:27,910
我去采点蓝莓
I'll fetch some blueberries.

878
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:14,620
克拉拉
Klara!

879
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:24,290
我的天啊
Holy Mother of God.

880
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:31,910
快点过来
Come over here!

881
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:41,200
来
Come on.

882

你行的

试试
Try it.

884
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,040
我知道你可以的
I know you can do it!

885
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,580
日安
Good day.

886
01:40:33,580 --> 01:40:35,790
我来接我的女儿
I'm here to collect my daughter.

887
01:40:35,950 --> 01:40:38,870
- 你好，阿蒙治叔叔  - 你好
- Hello Alp-Uncle.  - Hello.

888
01:40:42,250 --> 01:40:46,700
母亲，你怎么能带克拉拉来这样一个地方

889
01:40:46,870 --> 01:40:48,200
看看
Just look at it!

890
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:50,660
这不适合生病的女孩
This is no place for a sick girl.

891
01:40:50,830 --> 01:40:53,830
这间小屋，这些怪石嶙峋
This hut, these rocks everywhere.

892
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,660
你必须道歉，儿子
You must excuse my son.

893
01:40:55,830 --> 01:40:58,790
我现在要见我的女儿，她在哪儿

894

爸爸，我在这里

895
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:06,740
克拉拉

01:41:20,410 --> 01:41:22,410
爸爸
Father.

897
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:26,290
我的孩子
My child.

898
01:41:27,830 --> 01:41:29,410
你能走路了
You're walking.

899
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:35,950
请原谅我
Please forgive me.

900
01:41:36,870 --> 01:41:38,620
爸爸
Father.

901
01:41:44,290 --> 01:41:46,450
- 你能走路了  - 克拉拉
- You're walking.  - Klara.

902
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:59,040
我的孩子，这是给你的礼物

903
01:42:00,950 --> 01:42:02,120
谢谢你，奶奶

904
01:42:10,790 --> 01:42:12,120
里面什么也没有啊
There's nothing in it.

905
01:42:12,790 --> 01:42:15,660
你得自己把它填满
Because you'll fill it up yourself.

906
01:42:21,660 --> 01:42:23,160
怎么了，孩子
What's wrong, child?

907
01:42:23,660 --> 01:42:26,700
- 人们嘲笑我  - 为什么呢
- Everyone laughed at me.  - Why is that?

908
01:42:28,290 --> 01:42:30,370
因为我想写故事
Because I want to write stories.

909
01:42:31,250 --> 01:42:33,080
是吗
Is that right?

910
01:42:34,660 --> 01:42:37,660
他们鼠目寸光，海蒂
They just don't know any better, Heidi,

911
01:42:37,830 --> 01:42:39,740
因为他们只知道这个村子
because they only know this village.

912
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:44,540
但是你已经见识过外面的世界了，不是吗？
But you've seen more of the world,haven't you?

913
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:49,830
如果生活中的某件事情带给你快乐
If something in life brings you joy,

914
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:52,450
你只需要去做它就行
then you simply have to do it,

915
01:42:52,620 --> 01:42:54,540
不要管别人说什么
regardless of what people say.

916
01:43:03,330 --> 01:43:05,450
能见到你太好了
It was so lovely to see you.

917
01:43:07,370 --> 01:43:08,870
我会想你的
I'll miss you.

918
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:10,370
我也会想你的

919
01:43:19,870 --> 01:43:23,370
再见

920
