[克劳迪娅·玛丽号]

8
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,660
关于这个世界 他有好多都不理解
A lot of stuff that he just doesn't understand about the world

9
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,500
但我理解 所以这指引着我处世的
that I understand that makes ... it makes all my actions

10
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,260
所作所为
when I move through the world...

11
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,310
我做得更好
I do things better

12
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,510
因为在我看来它像地图一样清晰明确
because I can see it all laid out like a map.

13
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,980
你看过地图吗
Have you ever looked at a map?

14
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,440
- 看过 如果我没看错  - 你知道怎么看吗
- Yes. When I'm not mistaken.  - Do you know how to read a map?

15
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,630
- 你知道怎么看地图吗  - 知道
- Do you know how to read a map?  - Yeah.

16
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,360
你爸爸是个相当不错的人
Your father's a perfectly good guy,

17
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,680
但关于这个世界
but there's a lot of stuff

18
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,330
他有很多都看不透
that he just doesn't understand about the world

19
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,330
- 我却能  - 我爸爸
- that I understand.  - My dad...

20
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,200
- 停 听着  - 我爸爸
- Wait. Listen.  - My daddy's...

21
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,830
我还没问你问题呢
I haven't asked you a question yet.

22
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,700
我还没问你问题呢
I haven't asked you a question.

23
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,140
- 听着  - 我爸爸
- Listen. Shh.  - My daddy...

24
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,790
别告诉你妈妈 闭嘴 安静
Don't tell your mother. Shut up! By quiet.

25
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,860
安静 我还没问你问题呢
Shush. I haven't asked you the question yet.

26
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,840
我什么都没问你呢 听着
I haven't asked you anything. Listen. Shh.

27
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,880
安静 我们没事 别担心
Quiet. We got it. Don't worry about it.

28
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,860
听着
Listen.

29
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:58,530
如果
If there was...

30
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,520
如果你只能带一个人跟你去孤岛
if you could take one guy to an island with you

31
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,000
你知道跟他在一起你是安全的 因为他最厉害
and you knew you'd be safe because he was the best man

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,580
他会弄明白如何生存
and he was going to figure out how to survive,

33
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,990
他会做一切
he was going to make everything...

34
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,950
让你们在岛上幸福地生活
make the world a good place on the island,

35
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,400
他会一直让你开开心心的
he was going to keep you happy,

36
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,230
他是这项工作的最佳人选
he... this is the best man for the job, no matter what,

37
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,520
如果你必须在我和你爸爸之间选一个
if it was between me and your father,

38
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,290
- 你会选谁  - 我爸爸
- who would you say?  - My daddy.

39
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,740
我不明白 等一下
I don't see... hang on a second.

40
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,160
等一下 听着
Hang on a second. Listen.

41
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,640
我觉得你弄错了
I think you're wrong about that.

42
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,160
虽然确实是你来选 但我想让你明白
It's your choice to make, but I want you to understand something:

43
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,620
有很多
That there's a lot of...

44
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,550
选…怎么 你干什么
Pick up... what hap... what is that?

45
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,410
你不能把鱼竿丢下不管
You can't leave your fishing rod like that.

46
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,490
我不明白为什么它一直滴水
I don't know why the hell it keeps dripping.

47
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,590
一整晚 不停地滴 滴 滴
All night long... drip, drip, drip.

48
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,960
这破玩意我都让人修了十次了
I've had the fucking thing repaired ten times.

49
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,530
你需要一个新的塞子
You need a new stopper.

50
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,090
是吗
Is that it?

51
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,170
你的塞子
Your stopper's...

52
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,810
边缘都烂掉了
it's rotted all around the edges,

53
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,420
所以堵不住了
so it's not making a seal.

54
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,070
水就会从洗手池下面滴出去
The water's going to drip through to the bowl.

55
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,150
我可以
I could, uh...

56
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,510
我可以明天给你拿个新的
I could bring you a new one tomorrow.

57
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,710
或者你考虑一下把整个水池换掉
Or you might want to consider replacing the whole apparatus.

58
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,020
你建议我怎么做
What do you recommend?

59
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,910
我可以先换掉塞子
I could replace the stopper first.

60
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,640
如果这还不管用的话
If that doesn't work,

61
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,770
我就帮你换掉整个水池
I could replace the whole apparatus.

62
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,480
你没法给我专业意见吗
You can't give me a professional recommendation?

63
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,230
其实都取决于你
Well, it's really up to you.

64
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,440
明天我小姨子要带着侄子们过来
Tomorrow my sister-in-law's coming over with the nephews.

65
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,500
我得开车去接
I got to take the car in.

66
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,590
不 是我的妹妹简宁的大女儿的成年礼
No, it's my sister Jeanine's oldest daughter's bat mitzvah.

67
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,070
两百艘船沉没
Sank 200 ships...

68
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,590
我可能会无聊得要死
I'm looking forward to being bored to death.

69
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,960
风暴表明需要更多
The storm demonstrated the need for more...

70
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,750
那女孩不想办 他爸爸也不想
The girl doesn't want it, her father doesn't want it,

71
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,400
更别说我了
and don't even ask me.

72
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,650
要坐七个小时车
Seven hours in the car.

73
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,170
督促他们离开城市
...charge and leave their cities...

74
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,550
我真想割喉自杀
I could really slit my throat.

75
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,670
但那些小姑娘们很漂亮
But oh, well. The little girls are charming.

76
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,370
李 抱歉
Lee, I'm so sorry.

77
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,010
没事
That's okay.

78
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,370
太恶心了
This is so gross.

79
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,850
没关系
That's all right.

80
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,980
不 让他来吧
No, tell him to come.

81
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,090
好 好
Okay. Yeah.

82
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,990
但辛迪 我得告诉你件事
But... but... but, Cindy, I have to tell you something.

83
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,740
我爱上了我公寓的管理员
I'm, like, in love with my janitor.

84
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,500
是不是很变态
Is that sick?

85
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,450
你对勤杂工有过性幻想吗
Have you ever had a sexual fantasy about your handyman?

86
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,590
挺尴尬的 因为他其实是在
Well, it's awkward because he's literally, like,

87
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,760
疏通我马桶里的屎
cleaning the shit out of my toilet bowl right now,

88
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,570
而且我现在没那么性感
and I don't think I'm at my most alluring.

89
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,610
对 或许你说得对
Yeah, maybe you're right.

90
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,700
我又不是在社交场合见到他的
It's not like I met him socially.

91
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,560
好 谢谢 辛迪
Okay, thank you, Cindy.

92
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,850
好 二十分钟后见 再见
Okay. Like 20 minutes. Bye.

93
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,290
你好 都好了
Uh, hi. All set.

94
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,860
太感谢了
Thank you so much.

95
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,860
不客气
You're welcome.

96
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,220
我能给你点小费[提示]吗
Can I give you a tip?

97
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,260
你是说建议
You mean like a suggestion?

98
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,070
不 我想说小费
No. I mean like a tip.

99
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,170
好 谢谢
Okay. Thank you.

100
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,950
- 好  - 好
- Okay.  - Okay.

101
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,770
晚安
Good night.

102
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,180
晚安 再见
Good night. Goodbye.

103
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,030
我还得修多少次这破水管
I mean, how many times do I have to fix these fucking pipes?

104
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,030
我每次洗澡
Every time I take a shower,

105
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,780
整个房子都淹了
the entire apartment has a flood.

106
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,840
我简直要疯了
It's driving me insane.

107
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,960
我明天给你带个水管工过来
Well, I'll get you a plumber here tomorrow,

108
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,560
但我们得把所有地砖都刨开
but I'd say we're going to have to break through the tile

109
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,610
确定渗漏点
and isolate the leak because

110
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,810
因为下面有好多水
there's quite a lot of water down there.

111
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,270
你怎么知道是因为我 为什么自然就想到是我
How do you know it's me? Why is it automatically me?

112
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,560
因为如果是楼上漏的
Because if it was coming from higher up,

113
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,260
你家的天花板上或者墙上
you'd have water damage in your ceiling

114
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,590
会有漏水的痕迹 但这些地方都是干的
or in your wall, and it's all dry.

115
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:42,930
好极了
Great.

116
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,240
可能只是嵌缝
It might just be the caulking.

117
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,930
整个浴缸都需要重新弥缝
This whole tub needs to be recaulked.

118
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,530
你最近几小时泡过澡或者冲过淋浴吗
Have you taken a bath or a shower in the last couple of hours?

119
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,840
洗过
Yes.

120
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,080
应该就是这个原因了
It might just be that.

121
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,250
好 你怎么查明是不是
Okay. And how are you planning to find that out?

122
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,280
我们可以打开淋浴喷头 看它是不是往楼下滴水
Well, we could run the shower and see if it drips downstairs.

123
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,020
你想让我现在洗淋浴
Oh, you want me to take a shower right now?

124
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,580
不
No.

125
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,830
你想让我现在洗澡
You want me to take a shower right now

126
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,150
好让你在旁边看着
while you stand there watching to see

127
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,360
水会不会渗到弗里德里希家
if it drips into the Friedrichs' apartment?

128
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,940
我才不在乎你干什么 奥尔森夫人
I don't give a fuck what you do, Mrs. Olsen.

129
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,910
我只是想修好漏水的地方
I'm just trying to fix the fucking leak.

130
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,470
我喜欢
I... I like that.

131
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,580
你真是大胆 竟然这么跟我说话
How dare you talk to me like that.

132
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,690
快给我滚出去
Get the fuck out of my fucking house.

133
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,220
- 好  - 快滚出去
- Okay.  - Get the fuck

134
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,880
不然我就报警了
out of my fucking house before I call the police.

135
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,490
好
All right.

136
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,590
你听见没 我说滚
Did you hear me? I said get out.

137
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,760
我做不到 你堵着门呢
I can't. You're blocking the doorway.

138

00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,860
- 你的…  - 前妻
- Your, uh, uh...  - Ex-wife.

276
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,190
- 你是说兰迪吗  - 兰迪
- You mean Randi?  - Randi.

277
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,150
- 对 抱歉 就是兰迪  - 没问题
- Yes, I'm sorry. I meant Randi.  - That's okay.

278
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,860
我之前就想到了 我会打电话给她的
I already thought of that. I'll take care of it.

279
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,160
- 好的 谢了  - 不客气
- Okay. Thank you.  - No problem.

280
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,240
- 我现在能看他了吗  - 当然
- Can I see him now?  - Sure.

281
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,250
李 我能在这等着
Lee, I can wait up here.

282
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,840
李 如果你有什么需要
Lee, if you need anything.

283
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,720
好的
Okay.

284
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,710
- 谢谢  - 不客气
- Thanks.  - Yeah.

285
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,720
你要纸巾吗
Would you like a Kleenex?

286
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,360
- 好 谢谢  - 不客气
- Yeah, thanks. Yeah.  - Yeah.

287
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,340
我能拿两张纸巾吗
Can I get a couple Kleenex, please?

288
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,420
谢了 亲爱的
Thanks, hon.

289
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,820
- 抱歉  - 没关系的
- I'm sorry.  - Oh, please.

290
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,940
- 贝瑟尼医生怎么样了  - 她很好
- How is Dr. Betheny?  - Oh, she's doing very well.

291
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,390
她刚生了一对双胞胎女儿
She just had twin girls.

292
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,860
- 艾琳和我说了  - 对
- Oh, Irene told me that.  - Yeah.

293
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,860
我下午给她打电话说了发生的事情
I call this afternoon and tell her what happened.

294
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,040
她对他很好
She was very good to him.

295
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,780
她确实
Yeah, she was.

296
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,920
这种病通常被称作充血性心力衰竭
The disease is commonly referred to as congestive heart failure.

297
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,270
- 我的天  - 你熟悉这种病吗
- Oh, my God.  - Are you familiar with it?

298
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,340
- 不  - 那你刚才为什么说“我的天”
- No.  - Then what are you saying "Oh, my God" for?

299
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,400
因为 到底是什么病
Because... what is it?

300
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,550
她正想解释 亲爱的
She's trying to explain it, honey.

301
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,530
- 抱歉 贝瑟…  - 贝瑟尼医生
- I'm sorry, Dr. Beth...  - Betheny.

302
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,650
- 贝瑟尼 抱歉  - 没关系
- Betheny, I'm sorry.  - Not a problem.

303
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,410
所以你接着说
So you were saying.

304
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,600
是一种心脏肌肉的逐渐衰竭
It's a gradual deterioration of the muscles of the heart.

305
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,700
通常发生在老年人身上
It's usually associated with older people.

306
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,900
但也有极个别病例发生在年轻人身上
But in rare cases, it will occur in a younger person.

307
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,030
一些人五六十年间
Some people live up to 50-60 years

308
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,630
只会偶然发病一次
with just an occasional attack.

309
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,370
但大多数患者发病有周期性
But most people suffer periodic episodes,

310
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,780
会像你在周一那样
like the one you had on Monday,

311
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,720
出现进一步削弱肌肉的
which mimic the symptoms of a heart attack,

312
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,070
类心脏病症状
and which further weaken the muscle.

313
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,220
可能会让你卧床一到两周
They can put you out of commission for a week, two weeks.

314
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,780
你需要住院好让我们实时监测心脏情况
And you'll need to be hospitalized so we can monitor your heart,

315
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,970
因为这一两周内心跳骤停的风险很大
because the risk of cardiac arrest is elevated for a week or two.

316
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,020
我的天
Oh, my God.

317
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:07,780
- 但一般情况下  - 没关系
- But in between,   - It's okay.

318
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,240
大多数患者感觉很健康
most people feel perfectly healthy.

319
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,100
可以过基本的正常生活
You can basically live a normal life.

320
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,200
等等 你说一些人活了五六十年是什么意思
Wait. So what do you mean some people live to be 50-60 years?

321
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,640
你是说只活到五六十岁
I mean, are you saying total?

322
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,920
还是说在他们被确诊后还活了五六十年
Or are saying when they're diagnosed with this?

323
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,950
还是怎样 到底是什么意思
Or what? What are you saying?

324
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,980
告诉我实情吧
And tell me the fuckin' truth.

325
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,660
只活到五六十岁
Total.

326
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,220
绝大多数像你这种情况的患者
For most people with the particulars of your condition,

327
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,450
平均还能再活五到十年
the average life expectancy is five to ten years.

328
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,290
统计数据差异很大
The statistics vary widely.

329
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,730
统计数字不能代表你
You're not a statistic.

330
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,400
你只是一个个体
You're just one person,

331
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,630
我们不知道你将来会怎样
and we don't know what's gonna happen to you yet.

332
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,690
但这不什么好病
But it's not a good disease.

333
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,020
什么是疾病
What is a good disease?

334
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,890
- 接触毒漆引起的皮疹  - 脚癣吗
- Poison Ivy.  - Athlete's foot?

335
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,360
- 简直在搞笑  - 伊莉斯 拜托
- It's a comedy routine.  - Elise, please.

336
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,310
- 看在上帝的份上  - 我的天
- For Christ's sake.  - Oh, my God!

337
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,090
你什么时候才能不挑我刺
When am I gonna put one foot right?

338
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,520
- 给点提示怎么样  - 伊莉斯…
- How about a hint?  - Elise...

339
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,300
- 爸  - 怎么了
- Daddy.  - What?

340
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,430
她没事
She's fine.

341
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,850
我们都很难过
We're all upset.

342
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,120
我们要继续听
We're all gonna listen,

343
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,220
然后问我们能想到的所有问题
then we're gonna ask any of the questions we wanna ask,

344
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,720
接着我们看能一起做点什么 对吗
and then we're gonna figure out what to do together, right?

345
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,000
- 对  - 当然
- Right.  - Sure.

346
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,880
那你接着说 贝瑟医生
So you were saying, Dr. Beth.

347
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,280
- 贝瑟尼 爸  - 贝瑟尼医生 爸
- Betheny, Dad.  - It's Dr. Betheny, Dad.

348
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,430
把名字说对了
Get it right.

349
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,030
我不知道你们现在哪里来的幽默感
I do not see where the humor lies in this situation.

350
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,970
- 伊莉斯 你要冷静  - 不
- Elise, you must calm down.  - No.

351
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,370
- 抱歉 我不想…  - 不 别
- I'm sorry, I'm not trying to...  - No, no, don't.

352
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,170
别说了 我待不下去了 不
No more. I'm not gonna. Nope.

353
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,760
- 伊莉斯 我给你拿杯水吧  - 不用
- Elise, let me get you a glass of water.  - No.

354
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,530
- 爸 算了吧  - 就像你一样算了吧
- Daddy, forget it.  - Forget it like you.

355
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,580
每个人都该像你
Everybody should be just like you.

356
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,810
你知道吗 我不想在这当坏人了
You know what? I am tired of being the bad guy here.

357
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,040
老天 现在躺在医院里的是谁
Jesus Christ! Who's in the fuckin' hospital here?

358
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,720
对对 所以我是坏蛋
Right. Right. So I'll be the bad guy,

359
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,470
你在医院向你儿子解释笑话去吧
and you be in the hospital and explain the jokes to your son.

360
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,950
- 我回家了  - 你要回家了
- I'm going home.  - You're going home?

361
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,870
- 你要回家了  - 对
- You're going home?  - Yep!

362
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,920
- 我去把她拉回来  - 去她的
- Let me get her back.  - Fuck her.

363
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,090
- 别再那样说了  - 闭嘴
- Come on with that stuff already!  - Stop that shit!

364
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,750
谢谢 托尼
Thank you, Tony.

365
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,080
谢谢
Thank you.

366
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,300
我得去趟曼彻斯特
I have to get up to Manchester.

367
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,970
没人告诉帕特里克 对吗
Nobody told Patrick, right?

368
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,930
没有 你让我们在这等你回来
No, you had asked for us to wait for you to get here.

369
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,880
- 对 谢了  - 不用谢
- Yes. Thank you.  - Okay.

370
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,510
那么
So, um,

371
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,690
接下来的流程是怎样的
what is the procedure now?

372
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,310
你得和殡仪馆协调安排
Oh, now you have to make arrangements with a funeral parlor.

373
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,100
他们会很好地照料后事
And they pretty much take care of everything.

374
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:30,790
我一个殡仪馆的名字都不知道
I don't know the name of one.

375
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,960
没关系 我们可以帮你
That's all right. We can help you with that.

376
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,070
对
Oh, yeah.

377
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,600
然后他们就会过来把他带走吗
And they'll just come and pick him up?

378
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,450
- 对  - 对
- Yeah.  - Yes.

379
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,280
- 我能去打电话 李  - 好的
- I can make those calls, Lee.  - Okay.

380
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,900
如果有需要帮忙的随时告诉我
Let me know if you need any help with anything.

381
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,240
好的 谢谢
Okay. Thank you.

382
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,300
对了 我们还要谈谈
Yeah, we've gotta talk about the boat

383
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,910
船和网站的事
and the website,

384
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,470
还有其他的一切
and all that.

385
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,770
当然 我随时都在
Sure. I'm around.

386
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,640
我得在学校放学前赶过去 所以…
I gotta get up there before school let's out, so...

387
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,050
你只需要签字领走乔的遗物
You just have to sign for Joe's belongings.

388
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,690
这边走
Right this way.

389
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,680
在这里签字就行
Just gotta sign right here.

390
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,340
海洛温医生 如果你在四层
Dr. Hallerin, if you're on fourth floor,

391
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,680
请到护士站
please come to the nurses station.

392
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,390
乔的东西呢 就是放在这的那个塑料袋
Where's Joe's belongings? The plastic bag right here.

393
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,660
不好意思 稍等一下
Sorry. Give me a sec.

394
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,080
乔的东西呢
Where's Joe's belongings?

395
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,940
对 就这样 很好
All right, all right. That's good. Hup!

396
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,330
- 这样吗  - 对 但是拇指要远离鱼线
- Like that?  - Yeah, but keep your thumb off the line,

397
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,660
不然鱼上钩的时候一扯
because, if you get a strike,

398
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,920
鱼线就会把你的拇指划一个大口子
it's gonna slice it right open,

399
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,150
你知道之后会发生什么吗
and you know what happens then?

400
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,240
- 什么  - 鲨鱼闻到血的味道
- What?  - The sharks will smell the blood,

401
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,040
就会把咱们的船撕碎
and they'll rip this boat apart.

402
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,960
- 它们不会的  - 当然会
- No, they won't.  - Yeah, they will.

403
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,080
爸 是真的吗
Dad, will they?

404
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,620
- 是的  - 骗人
- Yes, sir.  - Shut up.

405
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,450
我见过一群鲨鱼把船撕成了碎片
You know, I seen a school of sharks tear a boat to pieces

406
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:48,790
就像那船是纸板做的似的
like it was made of cardboard,

407
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,200
就因为有个小孩往水里扔了个创可贴
because some kid threw a band-aid in the water.

408
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,400
是的
Oh, yeah.

409
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,820
是有这么件事
Yeah, he did.

410
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,040
- 就是这样  - 骗人
- Oh, yeah.  - No, you didn't.

411
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,270
有的时候让他们离我们远点的唯一办法就是
Sometimes the only way to keep them off is to throw the kid

412
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,550
往海里扔个小孩引开他们
directly in the ocean to distract them.

413
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,360
别胡说了 鲨鱼从来不成群出没
Shut up. Sharks don't even swim in schools.

414
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,120
他说鲨鱼不会成群出没
He says sharks don't swim in schools.

415
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,600
- 这孩子还挺机智的啊  - 的确
- Smart kid.  - Yeah, he is.

416
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,720
这么机智的孩子
A really smart kid is exactly the kind of quality meal

417
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,870
正是一群鲨鱼在绕着船打转的时候
a humongous school of sharks

418
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,720
所寻找的高水准大餐
is looking for when they're circling a boat.

419
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,090
李叔叔 你够了
Oh, Uncle Lee, shut up.

420
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,620
鱼上钩了 收线 收线 收线
Hey, you got a strike! Strike, strike, strike!

421
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,410
轻点拽 小心你的拇指
Ease up on the drag, and watch your fuckin' thumb!

422
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,320
- 你有鱼上钩了  - 天啊 别打我
- You got a strike now!  - Jesus! Don't hit me!

423
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,420
- 不准说脏话  - 他有鱼上钩了
- No swearing!  - He got a strike!

424
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,980
- 放松点  - 我能搞得定 我们搞得定
- Ease up on it.  - I got it! We got it!

425
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,380
开你的船去 管好你自己的事
Drive the boat! Mind your business!

426
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,720
- 你得把鱼钩住  - 是什么鱼
- You gotta get the hook in him.  - What kind of fish is it?

427
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,540
我们搞得定 闭嘴 管好你自己的事就行了
We're fine! Shut up! Mind your business!

428
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,130
- 什么鱼啊  - 大白鲨
- What kind of fish is it?  - Great white.

429
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:35,880
- 肯定是大白鲨  - 加把劲
- It's gotta be a great white.  - Come on!

430
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,260
- 肯定是大白鲨  - 闭嘴
- It's gotta be a great white.  - Shut up!

431
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,700
也有可能是梭鱼 谁知道呢
Or maybe a barracuda. Who knows?

432
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,850
不是鲨鱼
It's not a shark!

433
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,390
- 好了 拽上来  - 不是鲨鱼
- Come on, pull him up!  - It's not a shark!

434
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,940
- 别说了  - 拜托
- Just stop talking!  - Come on!

435
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,000
16号出口
松树街
曼彻斯特
距曼彻斯特木兰县的松树街还有0.5英里

436
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,710
那地方是怎么跟那里连接起来的
How come that's connected to those?

437
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,050
没有连起来 只是看起来像而已
It's not connected, it just looks that way.

438
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,180
我在教你认小岛呢
I'm trying to teach you the islands.

439
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,200
那座小岛被一个富豪买了
That's the island the rich guy bought

440
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,710
所以上面没有其他房子
so no one else would put a house on it.

441
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,680
就是那么有钱就是那么任性
That's how rich he is.

442
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,750
糕点师傅岛 痛苦岛
Baker island, Misery island.

443
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,370
我和你兰迪婶婶就是在痛苦岛上结婚的
Misery island's where me and your aunt Randi got married.

444

Well, there's always next time. Did you get any sleep?

457
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,750

463
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,290
- 我差点把你一头摔到地上  - 天啊

464
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,150

00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,710
你们真的用到渔具了吗
So did you guys actually use the fishing tackle?

479
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,060
当然了
Oh, yeah, we really did.

480
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,740
小帕钓到了一条十八磅的大青鱼
Patty caught a humongous bluefish... 18 pounds.

481
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,190

别碰我
Stop it.

488
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:03,030
别这样 停下
Oh, don't. Stop.

489
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,110
拜托 我还病着了
Please, I'm sick.

490
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,610
好了 真心的 离我远点
Okay. For real, get off of me.

491
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,950
- 嗨 斯坦尼  - 天 别碰他
- Hi, Stanny.  - Oh, god, let him alone.

492
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,140
- 你怎么没哭啊  - 我刚哄好他
- How come you're not crying?  - I just got him settled.

493
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,440
- 你把他哄好干什么  - 李 别把他抱起来
- What are you getting him settled for?  - Lee, don't pick him up.

494
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,440
如果他没有哭 就让他自己一个人待着
If he's not crying, leave well enough alone.

495
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,690
自己一个人待着 我和你妈妈
Leave well enough alone. That's what me and your mommy

496
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,270
就应该这样做 而不是结婚
should have done instead of getting married.

497
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,830
- 闭嘴吧  - 那就没有你了
- Oh, shut up.  - Then you wouldn't be here.

498
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,210
也没有你的姐姐们
Your sisters wouldn't be here,

499
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,220
我就能在我自己的客厅
and I could watch the football

500
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,780
安安静静看球赛了
game in my own living room with peace and quiet.

501
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,770
我想说你可以去自慰了
You know what? You can go fuck yourself.

502
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:41,320
那可真浪费 嗨 小家伙
Oh, jeez waste. Hey, kiddo.

503
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:44,200
天啊 你可真帅啊 你知道吗
Oh, my gosh. You're very handsome, you know that?

504
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,920
看到了吗 我没把他弄哭
See that? I didn't make him cry.

505
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,970
抱起来放下去
Up and down.

506
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,890
他没有哭
He's not crying...

507
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,750
因为我知道怎么搞定他
'Cause I know how to handle him.

508
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,800
他怎么样 乔怎么样
How is he? How's Joe?

509
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,700
他很好 还不错
He's fine. You know, he's... he's all right.

510
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,230
实际上 他还过得挺不错的
Actually, he's doing all right.

511
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,960
你们没有把啤酒喝完吗 你们今天过得还好吗
And you didn't run out of beer? You got through the day okay?

512
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,950
当然了 我们可是很节制的
Oh, yeah. We were very temperate.

513
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,750
我就不明白你们为什么还要费劲爬上那破船
I don't know why you guys bother getting on the friggin' boat.

514
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,010
什么意思 我们热爱大海啊
What do you mean? We love the sea.

515
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:19,420
是吗 你们在大海上喝了多少啤酒
Oh, yeah? How many beers did you have on the sea?

516
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,610
- 八瓶  - 八瓶
- Eight.  - Eight?

517
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:25,150
是啊 七个小时喝了八瓶
Yep, eight, over a seven-hour period, which...

518
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,670
真是大开眼界啊
Wow, I am well impressed.

519
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,070

00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,850
每小时一点一四二八五七二瓶吧
...1.1428572 beers an hour.

521
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,860
几乎就和没喝一样
It's like you didn't even have anything to drink at all.

522
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,830
我告诉过你我会少喝的
Yeah, I told you I was cutting down.

523
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:49,130
天啊 不要 你想干什么
Oh, god, no. What do you think you're gonna do?

524
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,010
我想我准备去洗个澡
I guess I'm gonna take a shower.

525
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,660
兰迪 我向上帝发誓
Randi, I swear to god.

526
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,630
你真该看看他的表情
You should have seen his face.

527
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,090
那么开心
So happy.

528
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:04,330
和我们带着姑娘们去玩旋转木马时她们的表情一样
It was like when we took the girls on the merry-go-round.

529
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,390
就是纯粹的开心
I mean, it was just pure happiness.

530
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,710
拜托 我病了
Oh, come on, I'm sick.

531
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:20,300
我病了 我是真的真的病得很严重
I'm sick. I'm really, really, deeply sick.

532
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,230
连呼吸都困难
It's hard to breathe.

533
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:36,020
他不在学校 我以为学校的放学时间是…
He's not at school? I thought school left out...

534
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,710
- 我很确定他…  - 什么
- I'm pretty sure he would have...  - What?

535
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,960
抱歉 保罗 我的手机…
I'm sorry, Paul, my phone is...

536
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,350
- 不好意思 能再说一遍吗  - 没事
- Sorry. Say that again?  - That's all right.

537
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:44,020
我很确定他去冰球训练了
I'm pretty sure he would have left for hockey practice by now.

538

00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:32,080
- 然后是《黑客帝国》  - 傻叉
- Then The Matrix.  - Retarded and shit.

671
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,420
我喜欢《星际迷航》
I love Star Trek!

672
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,050
- 真的吗  - 你胆敢这样说
- Oh, yeah, do you?  - How dare you?

673
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,350
去问帕特里克 他也喜欢这些
Ask Patrick. He loves 'em! He loves 'em!

674
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:40,340
- 帕特里克 你觉得呢  - 去问啊
- Patrick, what do you think?  - Go ahead, ask Patrick.

675
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,570
真不敢相信我们现在在聊《星际迷航》
I can't believe we're talking about Star Trek right now.

676
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:49,760
- 我喜欢《星际迷航》  - 谢谢
- I like Star Trek.  - Thank you.

677
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,670
嗨 李叔叔
Hey, uncle Lee.

678
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:55,730
塞尔维可以在这里过夜吗
Is it okay if Sylvie sleeps over?

679
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:56,900
我爸以前总答应她留这儿
Dad always let her.

680
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,300
那你为什么还来问我
Then what are you asking me for?

681
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,260
不为什么
No reason.

682
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:04,620
谢谢
Thanks.

683
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:10,760
别人不会来问这事
Uh, not that it would come up or anything,

684
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,310
但她父母以为她过夜都睡在楼下
but her parents thinks she stays downstairs when she stays over.

685
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:15,810
所以万一有人来问
So if it comes up for some reason,

686
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:17,880
你就说她在楼下睡的好吗
can you just say she stayed in the downstairs room?

687
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,530
- 我都不认识他们  - 你认识
- I don't even know them.  - Yeah, you do.

688
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:27,800
是麦甘恩一家 弗兰克和帕特·麦甘恩
It's the Mcganns. It's Frank and Pat Mcgann.

689
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,570
- 那是塞尔维·麦甘恩  - 对
- Oh, that's Sylvie Mcgann?  - Yeah.

690
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,020
- 好吧  - 所以
- Okay.  - So...

691
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:36,680
你可以说她睡在楼下吗
Do you mind saying she stayed downstairs,

692
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,560
如果他们来电话的话
like, if they call or something?

693
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,330
好
Okay.

694
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,990
我是不是该教你用避孕套了
Am I supposed to tell you to use a condom?

695
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,480
不
No. I mean...

696
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,370
- 乔是不是就会这么说  - 不
- Is that what Joe would say?  - No.

697
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,960
我是说 是的 我们之前讨论过了
Well, I mean, yeah, we've had the discussion and everything.

698
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,290
- 所以  - 好吧
- So...  - Yeah, good.

699
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,650
如果我们弄得太大声就跟我们说
Yeah, just let me know if we're making too much noise.

700
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,370
好
Okay.

701
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:11,760
我开玩笑的
Just fuckin' with you.

702
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,370
好吧
All right.

703
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,820
我是不是应该打电话给我妈
Um, do you think I should call my mom

704
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,050
告诉她我爸的事
to tell her about dad?

705
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:32,700
- 我不这么想 小帕  - 好吧
- No, I wouldn't, Patty.  - Yeah.

706
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,920
我是说 没人知道她在哪
I mean, uh, nobody even knows where she is.

707
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,670
是啊
Yeah.

708
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,780
我只是好奇你的想法
Yeah, no, I was just curious what you thought.

709
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:44,630
无所谓了 晚安 李叔叔
Anyway, good night, uncle Lee.

710
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:46,330
晚安
Good night.

711
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,400
你不会为了漏了一个球
Are you gonna sulk all night

712
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,090
生一整晚的闷气吧
long because you dropped the goddamn ball?

713
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:58,940
- 我没有生闷气  - 闭嘴吧
- I'm not sulking.  - Oh, shut up.

714
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,110
如果你肯用棒球手套
If you'd use a goddamn baseball mitt,

715
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,970
就不会漏掉这球了
you wouldn't drop the fuckin' ball.

716
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:03,690
我不需要棒球手套 我空手接的更稳
I don't need a baseball mitt! I catch better without one.

717
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:06,540
闭嘴 喂 伊莉斯
Hey, shut up. Hey, Elise!

718
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,200
糟透了
Oh, shit.

719
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,250
李 你能把小帕带上楼
Come on. Hey, Lee, you wanna take Patty upstairs

720
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,410
给他洗个澡吗
and get him washed up?

721
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:18,860
- 来吧 孩子  - 快上去
- Come on, kid.  - Go on, now.

722
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,830
没事的 我等会就上去
It'll be all right. I'll be up in a minute.

723
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:23,410
上楼吧 小帕 没事的
Go on upstairs, Patty. Everything will be okay.

724
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,890
我觉得你那球漏的不错
I thought it was wonderful how you dropped that ball.

725
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,070
- 好吧  - 我没想让你接住那球的
- Okay.  - I didn't want you to catch it.

726
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:33,850
烦死了
Oh, shit.

727
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,200
接着叫吧
Go on.

728
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,050
看在上帝的份上
Fuck's sake.

729
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,470
闭嘴吧
Shut the fuck up.

Beverly, Massachusetts, Gallagher funeral home, please.

733
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:35,230
早上好
Morning.

734
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,040
你好 我是李·钱德勒
Yes, hi, my name is Lee Chandler.

735
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,550
我哥哥约瑟夫·钱德勒在
My brother, Joseph Chandler, is at the Beverly...

736
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,370
贝弗利医院的太平间 我想知道
Hospital morgue. I'm wondering, uh,

737
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:52,180
我需要找谁预约
who I need to talk to about making arrangements?

738
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:56,700
好的 谢谢
Okay, thank you.

739
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,080
是的
Yes.

740
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,510
是的 我刚刚说了
Yes, I just spoke...

741
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,450
是的 我是李·钱德勒
yes, my name is Lee Chandler.

742
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,790
我哥哥在贝弗利医院的太平间
My brother is at the Beverly hospital morgue.

743
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:15,410
是的
Yes.

744
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:19,640
好
Okay.

745
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,530
我明白
I understand, I'm...

746
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,920
我是想问问我下一步
I'm calling to find out exactly what I need to do

747
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,700
具体要怎么完成预约
to make arrangements for the next step.

748
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:35,740
我知道了 谢谢
I see. Okay, thank you.

749
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:39,790
可以给我张餐巾吗
Can I have a napkin?

750
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:40,740
是的
Yes.

751
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:44,460
没错 所以我要怎么
That's right, so... but what do I gotta do to get his...

752
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,890
把他的尸体运到
to get his body over the...

753
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,070
打扰一下 钱德勒先生
Excuse me, Mr. Chandler,

754
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:50,110
我觉得帕特里克不必待在这里听这些
I don't think Patrick needs to be here for this.

755
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:51,810
别这样 我没事
Don't... I'm all right.

756
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:54,930
我明白 为什么把他的尸体
I understand. So why is it more

757
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:56,460
运到曼彻斯特就贵些
to drive his body to Manchester?

758
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,770
所以开七分钟的高速
So you gotta take the highway

759
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:00,080
就收费贵一些吗
for seven minutes, that's why it costs more?

760
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,060
那灵车走一二七号公路要多少钱
Well, what does it cost for the hearse to take 127?

761
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,820
天哪 他关注的就是这个
Jesus, like, that's his focus?

762
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:06,020
我没事的
Jeez, I'm all right.

763
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:11,710
[曼彻斯特·艾塞克斯中学]

764
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,750
谢谢 李叔叔
Thanks, uncle Lee.

765
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,730
不客气
You're welcome.

766
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,280
- 谢谢 钱德勒先生  - 不客气
- Thanks, Mr. Chandler.  - You're welcome.

767
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:33,830
这样吧
So...

768
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,910
我们不会计较骂人的事
We're gonna forget about the language.

769
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:39,880
也不会计较打架的事
We're gonna forget about the fists.

770
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:43,250
但我希望你这几天休息一下
But I want you to take a few days off of practice.

771
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:45,730
我不想让你上冰训练
I don't want you on the ice.

772
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,650
说真的 先生
Well, to tell you the honest truth, sir,

773
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,490
我觉得那样能帮我分散注意力
I could really use the distraction.

774
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,960
冰上训练不是用来分散注意力的
The ice is not a distraction.

775
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:56,440
你在冰上的时候 就要专注
When you're on the ice, you gotta be there.

776
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:00,010
休息几天吧
Okay, so take a couple days off,

777
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:01,190
然后我们再聊
and we'll talk.

778
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:04,060
听我说
Listen.

779
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:08,540
在你这么大的时候 我也失去了父亲
When I was your age, I lost my dad, too.

780
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:10,110
所以…
So...

781
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:14,540
我能体会你的心情
I know what you're... you're goin' through.

782
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:17,480
如果你想来聊一聊
If you want to come in and talk,

783
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,950
找人讲讲心里话
or want somebody to spill your guts to,

784
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:22,770
或者就是闲聊
or throw the bull around,

785
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:24,970
我随时欢迎
the door's open.

786
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,570
你介意我开音乐吗
You mind if I put some music on?

787
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:37,320
开吧
No.

788
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,400
现在是五四…
It's at 54...

789
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:45,570
你喜欢这帮人吗
Do you like these guys?

790
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:49,180
主吉他有点弱
The lead guitar is weak,

791
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,630
但其他的都很棒
but otherwise they're pretty good.

792
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:53,690
我听不出什么差别
Oh, they all sound the same to me.

793
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:01,260
我们去哪
Where are we goin'?

794
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,020
去见律师
Gotta go to the lawyer.

795
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:04,700
做什么
What for?

796
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,850
听他读你父亲的遗嘱
To read your father's will.

797
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,340
我一定要在场吗
Do I have to be there?

798
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,490
我不觉得 但你应该去
I don't think so, but I think you're supposed to be.

799
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,520
你觉得他会把船留给谁
Who do you think he left the boat to?

800
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:18,480
他肯定会把所有东西留给你
I'm sure he left you everything.

801
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,780
我不明白
I don't understand.

802
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:33,030
你对哪里不明白
Which, uh, part are you having trouble with?

803
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:34,630
我不可能做他的监护人
Well, I can't be the guardian.

804
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:43,660
我是说 我做不了
I mean, I can't.

805
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,350
我还以为乔已经
Well, naturally, I... I assumed Joe had

806
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,000
跟你商量过这件事了
discussed all this with you.

807
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:50,720
没有
No.

808
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:53,580
他没说过
He didn't.

809
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:55,780
没有
No.

810
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:00,140
我…
Uh, I... I...

811
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:02,640
对不起 我很惊讶
sorry, I have to say, I'm somewhat taken aback.

812
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,640
他不可能和我一起住 我只有一间房间
He can't live with me. I live in one room.

813
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:07,560
但乔已经准备好了帕特里克的抚养费
Well, but Joe has provided for Patrick's upkeep.

814
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,360
供他吃穿等等
Food, clothes, etcetera.

815
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,080
而且房子和船都完全是个人所有的
And the house and the boat are owned outright.

816
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,560
我不可能每天往返波士顿
I can't commute from Boston every day

817
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,710
直到他十八岁
until he turns 18.

818
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,190
我觉得他是想让你换个地方住
I think the idea was that you would relocate.

819
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:19,120
换…换到那里
R... relocate to where?

820
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,200
- 你看…  - 这里
- Well, you look...  - Here?

821
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,140
你的哥哥
Well, as you can see, your brother

822
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:24,040
已经把所有事情打点好了
worked everything out extremely carefully.

823
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,280
- 但他不可能  - 就是那样的
- But he can't have...  - Yes.

824
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:26,680
他不可能是那个意思
He can't have meant that.

825
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:29,450
他准备了五千美元
Uh, he's allowed up to $5,000

826
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:31,010
用作你的搬家费用
to pay for moving expenses.

827
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:32,820
还有一小笔钱
And there's, uh... there's also a small amount

828
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:35,000
是留作
set aside for, uh, you know,

829
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,270
你安顿好之前的个人收入
for you to draw from as personal income while you settle in.

830
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,210
如果你同意当监护人的话
I mean, assuming...that you accept.

831
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:44,260
我的叔叔唐尼和姨妈特丽莎呢
What about my uncle Donny and aunt Teresa?

832
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:47,710
乔不觉得帕特里克和他们关系特别
Joe didn't feel that Patrick really had any special relationship

833
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:49,090
- 或者很亲近  - 我不明白
- or feeling about them.  - I don't understand.

834
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,940
而且现在 我觉得你知道
And now, as I think you know,

835
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,490
他们搬去了威斯康辛
they've moved out to Wisconsin, I believe.

836
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:53,470
明尼苏达
Minnesota.

837
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:56,500
- 明尼苏达  - 明尼苏达的明内通卡
- Minnesota.  - Minnetonka, Minnesota.

838
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,380
没错
That's right.

839
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:19,100
我记得这些年你在这里住过不少时候
It was my impression that you'd spent a lot of time here over the years.

840
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:21,050
我只是来帮帮忙
I was just the back up.

841
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:23,640
过来照顾一下小帕
I came up here to look after Patty, yeah,

842
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,910
如果乔进医院的话 我父亲已经不在了
if Joe was in the hospital after my father couldn't do it,

843
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:26,730
但我们…
but we...

844
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,670
应该是唐尼才对
it was supposed to be Donny.

845
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:31,600
我只是帮下忙
I'm just the back up.

846
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,710
我只能说我…
Well, I... I can just repeat that I'm... I'm...

847
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:40,840
我很惊讶乔没有跟你说这件事
astonished that Joe didn't run this by you,

848
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,990
他是个很仔细的人
thorough as he was.

849
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:44,690
因为他知道我会怎么回答他
Yeah, 'cause he knew what I would say if he would have asked.

850
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,080
就一次 就那一次
Once! It was once!

851
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,320
一次而已没什么大不了
Oh, one time nothin'. It's nothin' but one time.

852
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:55,140
别打这半边 你就不会哭着回家
Stay out of this quadrant, and you won't go home in tears.

853
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:55,750
好吧
All right.

854
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,190
声音小一点 你们这群蠢货
You wanna keep it down, you fuckin' morons?

855
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,530
我的孩子们在睡觉
My kids are sleepin'.

856
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:13,950
对不起 我不知道我们有那么吵
I'm so sorry. I am... I didn't think we were that loud.

857
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:16,280
李 你能把这群蠢货
Lee. You wanna get these fuckin' pinheads

858
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,500
弄出我的房子吗
out of my house, please?

859
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:19,700
好 我会的
Yeah, I do.

860
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,050
兰迪 我真的会的
Randi, I really do.

861
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:27,860
她不该那样跟我们说话
She can't talk to us that way.

862
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:28,460
没错
Yeah.

863

I'm not fuckin' around!

现在可是凌晨两点了
It's two o'clock in the fuckin' morning.

865
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,570
让这帮混蛋穿好衣服
Get these fuckin' assholes dressed,

866
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:41,890
滚出去
and get 'em the fuck out of here!

867
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:49,610
我们都穿着呢
We are dressed.

868
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,490
她不是这个意思 她会道歉的
She didn't mean it. She'll apologize later.

869
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,010
你们该走了
Gotta get out of here, man.

870
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,330

- Tell Randi we're sorry.  - Good night!

00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:13,950
- 喝酒就别开车了  - 我们很抱歉
- Don't drink and drive.  - We're so sorry!

875
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,170
你看见木星了吗
You see Jupiter?

876
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,100
注意看路

晚安 乔
Good night, Joe!

再次说声抱歉
Sorry again!

880
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:29,480
往前 看木星 你个笨蛋
Go ahead. It's Jupiter, you fuckin' idiot.

881
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,170
看 那有北极星
Look at, there's the north star right there.

- 就在那  - 在哪
- Right there.  - Where?

00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:35,210
正北方
It's... it's due north.

884

我早上会打扫干净的
I'll clean up in the morning.

你看见木星了 你个笨蛋
You see Jupiter, you fuckin' asshole?

李 没人能理解你的经历
Lee, nobody can appreciate what you've been through.

891
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,910
原谅我这样说
If I can say that.

892
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:36,150
如果你真的觉得你做不了监护人
And if you really feel like you can't take this on,

893
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,120
那是…
well, that's... that's...

894
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:40,400
那是你的权利
you know, that's your right.

895
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,530
- 明显地  - 那谁会做他的监护人
- Obviously.  - So who would get him?

896
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:49,450
帕特里克 要我给你买罐苏打之类的吗
Patrick, can I get you a can of soda or anything?

897
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:50,430
不用了 谢谢
No, thank you.

898
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:55,510
我不知道帕特里克的妈妈怎么了
Well, I don't know what's happening with Patrick's mother.

899
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,120
- 不  - 我不知道她在哪
- No.  - I'm not sure where she is,

900
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,510
- 也不知道她现在的情况  - 不
- or what kind of condition she's in.  - No.

901
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,120
不能那样
We can't do that.

My kids are in there!

Look, Lee.

00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,130
你为什么不…
Why don't you just...

909
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:05,020
我该…保持联系
I'm gonna... I'll be in touch.

[警察局]

912
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:45,360
我们之前玩得很嗨
Well, we were partying pretty hard.

913
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:47,460
喝了酒
And there was beer.

914
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:51,550
有人在分大麻
And someone was passin' around a joint,

915
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:52,790
还有可卡因
and there was cocaine.

916
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:54,160
可卡因
Cocaine?

917
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:55,180
对
Yes.

918
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:57,030
好的 继续
Okay, go ahead.

919
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:04,970
我们的卧室在楼下
Uh, anyway, our bedroom is in the downstairs,

920
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:07,370
孩子们在楼上睡觉
and the kids sleep upstairs,

921
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:12,090
大概两点的时候兰迪把大家赶走了
so Randi makes everyone leave around 2:00.

922
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:14,050
或者是三点
Or 3 A.M.

923
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:15,840
然后
And then...

924
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,100
她回去睡觉了
She goes back to bed.

925
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:24,640
我就上楼看了看孩子们
So I go upstairs to check on the kids,

926
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,680
楼上特别冷
and it's fuckin' freezin' upstairs,

927
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:28,580
但我不能开暖气
but I can't use the central heat

928
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:30,480
那会让兰迪的鼻子很干
'cause it dries out randi's sinuses,

929
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,910
而且她的头会很疼
and gives her really bad headaches.

930
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:36,220
所以我下楼在壁炉里生了火
So I go downstairs and I put a fire in the fireplace,

931
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:38,140
坐着看电视
and sit down and watch TV,

932
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,890
但是啤酒喝完了
but there's no more beer.

933
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,820
我还是兴奋地上蹿下跳 像个大野兔
I'm still jumpin' around like... a jackrabbit,

934
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:49,390
所以我又往炉子里加了几根木头
so I put a couple of fire logs in the fire,

935
01:00:49,390 --> 01:00:54,380
我只是希望我走了房子里能暖和起来
and I... just to warm up the house while I was gone.

936
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:03,400
然后我就去小店了
And then I... I'm goin' to the mini mart,

937
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,680
不过我嗨过头了 不想开车
but I'm too wasted and I don't want to drive.

938
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:10,060
我是走过去的 来回大概各要二十分钟
So I walk, it's about 20 minutes each way.

939
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:12,370
走在半路上的时候
I'm about halfway there,

940
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,840
我发现我不记得有没有把防火板放回去了
and I can't remember if I put a screen on the fireplace.

941
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,500
但我觉得没什么关系
I figure it's okay.

942
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:33,720
就继续往商店走了
So I just keep goin' to the store.

943
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:41,110
就这些
And, uh, that's it.

944
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:46,010
木头一定是滚到了地板上
Log must have rolled out onto the floor.

945

消防员说他们把兰迪救出来了
Uh, fireman said they pulled Randi out.

946
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,770
她在楼下昏了过去
She's passed out downstairs.

947
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:55,710
然后…
And, uh...

948
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:00,920
然后炉子就炸了
and then the furnace blew,

949
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:02,750
他们没能再次进去
and they couldn't go back in again.

950
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:08,050
我就记得这些了
And...that's all I remember.

951
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:15,530
好的 李 现在就这样
Okay, Lee, that's all for now.

952
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,130
如果有其他事情
We'll... we'll call you if anything else comes up

953
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:19,370
我们会再找你问的
we want to ask you about.

954
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,370
如果取证结果能证明你的清白的话
Assuming the forensics bear you out,

955
01:02:22,370 --> 01:02:24,850
我觉得应该没什么问题
which I'm assuming they will.

956
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,700
那么 就这样吗
So, uh, that's it?

957
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,660
李 你犯了一个大错
Look, Lee, you made a horrible mistake.

958
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,750
每个人都会犯错
Like a million other people did last night.

959
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:37,860
不会因为犯错就严惩你的
Not gonna crucify you.

960
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:42,640
忘了火炉上的防护网可不是什么大罪
It's not a crime to forget to put the screen on the fireplace.

961
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:45,860
我的意思是
Well, I mean, you know,

962
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:46,780
我可以走了
so I can go?

963
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:50,380
如果没什么我们还应该知道的
Well, if something comes up we don't already know about,

964
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:51,680
是的
yeah.

965
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,210
需要送你回家吗
You got anyone to give you a ride back home?

966
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:58,580
乔在吗 你父亲在这里吗
Is Joe here? Is your dad here?

967
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:01,180
是的
Yeah.

968
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:05,170
- 抱歉  - 好吧
- Sorry.  - Okay.

969
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:34,500
儿子
Son!

970
01:03:36,110 --> 01:03:38,080
放下枪 放下
Put it down. Put it down!

971
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,120
趴在地上 趴下
Get on the ground. Get on the ground.

972
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,150
- 拜托  - 冷静 冷静
- Ah, please!  - Settle down. Settle down.

973
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:43,990
- 我们现在得把你铐上  - 趴着别动
- We need some cuffs right now.  - Stay down.

974
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:46,370
- 别动  - 把他放倒
- Stay down.  - Down, down, get him down.

975
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:06,710
好了 我们走
All right, let's go.

976
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:10,660
再见
Bye.

977
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,510
我们去哪儿 孤儿院吗
Where we goin', to the orphanage?

978
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:15,660
- 闭嘴  - 我做什么了
- Shut up.  - What the hell did I do?

979
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:17,050
安静点
Just be quiet.

980
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,460
我们有很多事情要做
All right, we got a lot to do.

981
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:27,440
船怎么办
What about the boat?

982
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:29,470
我们可以跟乔治谈谈 如果没人使用
We can talk to George about it. There's no use hangin' onto it

983
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:31,190
- 留着它没什么用  - 我会用它的
- if no one's gonna use it.  - I'm gonna use it.

984
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:32,780
- 它还需要保养  - 我会给它保养的
- It's gotta be maintained.  - I'm maintaining it.

985
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:36,060
- 我会保养它的  - 你自己可办不到
- I'm gonna maintain it.  - You can't maintain it by yourself.

986
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:36,870
怎么不行 现在船是我的 对吗
Why not? It's my boat now, isn't it?

987
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:38,880
因为你还未成年 所以你不能独自把它开出去
'Cause you're a minor, you can't take it out alone.

988
01:04:38,970 --> 01:04:39,950
我…我是托管人
I'm... I'm the trustee.

989
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:41,110
- 我会来付钱  - 托管人是什么意思
- I gotta make the payments...  - What does trustee mean?

990
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,470
我会一直负责监管
I gotta keep up the inspections.

991
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:44,690
就是说我会处理所有事直到你…
It means I'm in charge of handling everything for you until...

992
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:45,300
就是说即使我不同意
Does that mean you're allowed

993
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:46,520
- 你也有权把船卖掉吗  - 直到你满十八岁
- to sell the boat if I don't want you to?  - Until you turn 18.

994
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:47,410
我也不确定
 I don't know.

995
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:49,640
我会考虑卖船的
I'll definitely consider it.

996
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:50,980
他妈的不行
No fuckin' way.

997
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,240
你过于自信了
You're so goddamn sure of yourself.

998
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:54,560
没人能开船 你才十六岁
There's no one to run it. You're 16 years old.

999
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:55,440
我今年就拿驾照
I get my license this year.

1000
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,540
没所谓 你还是未成年
Doesn't matter, you're still a minor.

1001
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:58,060
你不能独自驾驶商用船只
You can't run a commercial vessel by yourself.

1002
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,160
同时 费用也不少
Meanwhile, it's a big fuckin' expense,

1003
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,120
这些都得我负责
and I'm the one that's gotta manage it,

1004
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:02,690
- 而且我还不在这里  - 谁他妈在乎你在哪里
- and I'm not gonna be here.  - Who gives a fuck where you are?

1005
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,780
小帕 我发誓我会狠狠教训你的
Patty, I swear to god, I'm gonna knock your fuckin' block off.

1006
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:07,110
- 孩子教得不错  - 什么 你说什么
- Great parenting.  - What? What'd you say?

1007
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:08,490
- 我说你把孩子教得不错  - 去你妈的
- I said great parenting.  - Fuck you!

1008
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:10,110
没他妈的多管闲事 你这个傻逼
Mind your fuckin' business, you fuckin' asshole!

1009
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:12,000
你往我脸上打啊
You're gonna smash me in the face.

1010
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:12,980
没事了 没事了
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

1011
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:15,180
- 没事了  - 你他妈想让我打你脸
- It's okay, it's okay.  - You want me to smash your fuckin' face,

1012
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:17,400
- 你个傻逼  - 没事了
- you fuckin' asshole.  - It's okay. It's okay.

1013
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:18,920
谢谢 没事了
Thank you. Thank you. It's okay.

1014
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,880
李叔叔 你不是有毛病
Uncle Lee, are you fundamentally unsound?

1015
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:23,500
快他妈的上车
Get in the fuckin' car.

1016
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:29,230
你不开锁我怎么上车
Can't obey your orders until you unlock the door.

1017
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:30,040
闭嘴
Shut up.

1018
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:48,690
这引擎不会马上报废
It's not like the motor's gonna die tomorrow,

1019
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:51,810
但是乔说它总是出问题
but Joe said it keeps breakin' down like a son of a bitch.

1020
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:53,050
是啊 但是我们会检查一下
Yeah, but we were gonna take a look...

1021
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:54,260
今天有个遗产分配的事情
see, there's an allotment of some kind, but...

1022
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:55,470
但我们周末会有时间看看的
take a look this weekend.

1023
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:57,400
还有些事情没定下来
Things are a little bit up in the air.

1024
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:58,910
我不是那个意思
No, I... I can take care of it

1025
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:00,480
如果只是常规保养 我可以帮忙照看它
as far as the general maintenance is concerned,

1026
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,420
但是引擎说不定什么时候就不行了
but that motor's gonna go at some point.

1027
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:03,290
我来照看它
I'm taking care of it.

1028
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:05,080
没有买新引擎的钱
There's no allotment for a new motor.

1029
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:07,400
除非 乔治你知道谁想买下它
Unless, George, you know someone who wants to buy it.

1030
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,730
等一下 我不想把它卖掉
Wait a second, I'm not selling it.

1031
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:12,090
不管怎样 我们会住在波士顿
We're gonna be in Boston, anyway.

1032
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:13,270
什么
What?!

1033
01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:15,050
我们什么时候说要去波士顿了
Since when are we supposed to be in Boston?

1034
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:16,260
别激动
Just take it easy.

1035
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:17,670
不管你做什么决定
Well, whatever you decide,

1036
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:19,940
船在这放着都会把你们口袋掏空的
it's gonna bleed you dry just sittin' here.

1037
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:21,390
我们还不清楚最终怎样决定
Well, we don't know exactly what we're doin'.

1038
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:23,640
如果他周末想回来
Well, you know, he can always stay with us

1039
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:25,040
可以住在我们家
if he wants to come up weekends.

1040
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:26,680
你想成为他的监护人吗
Do you want to be his guardian?

1041
01:06:29,630 --> 01:06:31,580
- 我们已经…  - 他不想当我的监护人
- Well, we already...  - He doesn't want to be my guardian,

1042
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:33,850
- 看在上帝的份上  - 我们还打算少几个孩子呢
- for Christ sakes.  - We're tryin' to lose some kids at this point.

1043
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:34,690
你见过他的房子吗
Have you seen his house?

1044
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,240
- 是的  - 不 我们想把程序搞清楚
- Yeah.  - No, we're tryin' to work out the logistics,

1045
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,470
- 所以我不知道…  - 我们家太挤了
- so I don't know...  - We're jammed in there pretty good,

1046
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:38,780
- 但是我们…  - 上帝啊 你能闭嘴吗
- but we...  - Jesus Christ, will you stop?

1047
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:40,310
如果他愿意的话 总是可以睡我们的沙发的
We've always got a sofa for him any time he wants.

1048
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:41,640
- 乔治  - 你知道 对吗
- George...  - You know that, right?

1049
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:42,560
好吧 我是知道
That's all right, I know... I know that.

1050
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:44,600
- 我们随时欢迎他来  - 我明白
- He's welcome any time.  - I understand.

1051
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,600
我明白 谢谢你
I... I know. Thank you.

1052
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:50,920
你是脑残吗
Are you brain damaged?

1053
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:52,790
你不能那样跟别人说话
You can't just talk to people like that.

1054
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:54,930
你不想当我的监护人 我没意见
You don't want to be my guardian, that's fine with me.

1055
01:06:54,930 --> 01:06:56,690
不是这样的 只是程序的问题
It's not that, it's just the logistics.

1056
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:58,640
我发誓会搞清楚的
I've just gotta work it all out, I swear.

1057
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,850
怎么搞清楚 他们要送我去明尼苏达的
How? My takin' me to Wonkatonka, Minnesota,

1058
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:01,970
- 瓦卡通卡找唐尼叔叔呢  - 明内通卡
- with uncle Donny?  - Minnetonka.

1059
01:07:01,970 --> 01:07:04,000
- 明尼苏达的明内通卡  - 明尼苏达的明内通卡
- Minnetonka, Minnesota.  - Okay, Minnetonka, Minnesota.

1060
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:04,940
没什么不同
Same difference.

1061
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,240
我妈妈呢
What about my mother?

1062
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:11,640
什么
Huh?

1063
01:07:11,850 --> 01:07:13,690
法官不会同意的
The judge would never let that happen.

1064
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:16,440
- 再说也没人知道她在哪里  - 我知道
- And anyway, no one even knows where she is.  - I do.

1065
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,200
她在康涅狄格
She's in Connecticut.

1066
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:19,380
至少去年的时候她在那里
At least she was last year.

1067
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:21,660
你什么时候知道的
Since when do you know that?

1068
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:23,530
她去年给我发过邮件
Well, she emailed me last year,

1069
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:24,600
我就给她回信了
so I emailed her back.

1070
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:25,860
你了解电子邮件吗
You know email?

1071
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:27,750
你爸爸知道你跟她联系吗
Did your father know you were in touch with her?

1072
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:28,750
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding?

1073
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:32,520
我们能走走吗 我冷死了
Can we walk? I'm freezing.

1074
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:42,730
- 我只知道…  - 我明白
- All I know is...  - I know, I know, I know.

1075
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:43,900
她酗酒 她是个疯子
She's a drunk, she's insane,

1076
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:45,380
她让狗在地板上拉屎
she let the dog shit on the floor.

1077
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:46,710
你爸爸最不想见的
It's the last thing that your father

1078
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:47,800
就是这样
ever would have wanted.

1079
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:48,940
现在你倒是
Oh! Oh, like suddenly you care

1080
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:49,950
在乎他的想法了
what he would have wanted.

1081
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:53,170
现在去哪儿
Where to now?

1082
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:56,680
- 殡仪馆  - 真好
- The funeral parlor.  - Great.

1083
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:04,350
等等 我们这是去…
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where are we...

1084
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:05,380
我们这是去哪儿
where are we goin'?

1085
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:07,550
他在贝弗利
He's in Beverly.

1086
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:09,370
曼彻斯特没有殡仪馆吗
There's no funeral homes in Manchester?

1087
01:08:09,370 --> 01:08:10,270
没有
Nope.

1088
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:14,910
这里有墓地
The cemetery's here.

1089
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:26,950
我们赶紧把这事办完吧
Let's just get this done.

1090
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:31,200
往南走有很多来过冬的人
Down south, we got a lot of snowbirds.

1091
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:34,790
年初时 北边的人搬去那里
Early in the year, people from the north head down there,

1092
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:37,360
他们从别的地方来 然后在那里死去
they die down there, they're not from the area.

1093
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:41,050
他们喜欢我们这儿什么
What do they even like about us?

1094
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:43,880
- 为所爱的人做安排  - 好吧
- Makin' arrangements for a loved one.  - Right.

1095
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,770
很多情况下 搬到这里来
A lot of times, people are comin' in,

1096
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:47,770
- 就是他们最后的愿望了  - 是的
- last thing they had on their mind.  - Right.

1097
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:51,380
有时候我发现家庭尽管有不和
Sometimes I find there's dysfunction in the family still,

1098
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:54,260
但是大家还是会到一起来 你明白吗
somehow people come together. You know?

1099
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:59,320
老兄 那个一脸严肃的人
Dude, what is with that guy

1100
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,880
到底是怎么回事
and the big serious and somber act?

1101
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:03,990
我不知道
I don't know.

1102
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:05,750
不 但是认真的讲 他自己不清楚
No, but seriously, does he not realize

1103
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:08,240
别人知道他每天都做同样的事吗
that people know he does this every single day?

1104
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:10,490
我不知道
I don't know.

1105
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:13,310
我们为什么不把他埋了
Why can't we bury him?

1106
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:16,230
天冷了 地太硬了
Too cold. The ground is too hard.

1107
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:17,020
春天再埋
They'll bury him in the spring.

1108
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:18,610
那在春天之前他怎么办
So what do they do with him until then?

1109
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,190
放在冷库里
Put him in a freezer.

1110
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:24,100
你说真的吗
Are you serious?

1111
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:26,030
是的
Yes.

1112
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:29,880
这把我吓到了
That really freaks me out.

1113
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:31,770
没关系
It doesn't matter.

1114
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:34,240
等等
Wait a minute.

1115
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:36,150
等等
Wait.

1116
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:40,660
好像车停在那边 抱歉
I think I parked the car the other way. Sorry.

1117
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:47,160
小型蒸汽铲怎么样
What about one of those mini steam shovels?

1118
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:49,540
什么
What?

1119
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:51,220
有一次我在纽黑文的墓地里
I once saw one of those mini steam shovels

1120
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:53,120
见过那种小型蒸汽铲
one time in a graveyard in New Haven.

1121
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:55,540
两秒钟就能挖出一个完美的坑
It's like a perfect little hole in about two seconds.

1122
01:09:56,350 --> 01:09:58,500
我真的不知道去哪里买
Well, I don't really know how to get a hold of one

1123
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:00,980
也不知道要花多少钱
or how much it would cost.

1124
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:02,710
我们为什么不能考虑一下呢
Why can't we just look into it?

1125
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:05,280
因为你不能在历史悠久的
Because you can't use heavy equipment

1126
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,960
玫瑰谷公墓里使用重型设备
in the historic Rosedale cemetery.

1127
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,840
为什么不能
Why not?

1128
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:10,970
因为那里葬着一些非常重要的人物
Because there are very important people

1129
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:11,740
和他们的子孙
who are buried there,

1130
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:13,550
他们都不想自己的遗体
and their descendants don't want steam shovels

1131
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:15,100
被蒸汽铲打扰
vibrating over their dead bodies.

1132
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:18,130
那我们为什么不把他埋在别处
Well, why can't we just bury him someplace else?

1133
01:10:18,430 --> 01:10:20,320
因为乔买的地方就在那里
Because that's the plot that Joe bought.

1134
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:21,930
别问我为什么
Don't ask me why.

1135
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:23,490
但是如果你有其他打算
But if you want to make some other arrangements,

1136
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:25,060
或者想把他埋在别处
you want to find someplace else to bury him,

1137
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:26,230
你得去跟殡仪馆的人谈
you want to talk to the mortician,

1138
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,390
你还得给圣心教堂打电话
and you want to call up Sacred Heart

1139
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:28,470
跟马丁神父谈谈
and talk to father Martin

1140
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,970
看看如果改变计划的话
and find out how much that's gonna cost

1141
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:31,420
要花多少钱
and make all those arrangements,

1142
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:32,950
随便你 否则的话 就按现在的来
be my guest. Otherwise, let's just leave it.

1143
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:34,960
我只是不喜欢让他躺在尸体冷藏柜
I just don't like him being in a freezer.

1144
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:36,780
没错
Yeah.

1145
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:40,010
我也不喜欢
I don't like it, either,

1146
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:41,840
但那并不是他 因为他已经去世了
but it isn't him because he's gone.

1147
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,640
那只是他的躯体
It's just his body.

1148
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:45,710
我只想说我被吓到了
I'm just saying it kind of freaks me out.

1149
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:49,040
该死 我把车停哪了
Oh, god damn it, where did I park the car?

1150
01:10:49,690 --> 01:10:51,470
我不知道 但我希望你赶快弄清楚
Yeah, I don't know, but I wish you'd figure it out

1151
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:53,230
因为我快冻死了
because I'm freezing my ass off.

1152
01:10:54,130 --> 01:10:55,760
你没有正常点的棉衣吗
You don't have a normal winter coat?

1153
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:58,220
- 没有吗  - 有 我有
- Huh?  - Yeah. Yeah, I do.

1154
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,560
你怎么不戴有指头的手套
Why don't you wear gloves with the real fingers on them?

1155
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:05,010
我的天
Oh, god, fuck.

1156
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:07,780
我把该死的车停哪去了
Oh, fuck, where did I park this motherfucking car?

1157
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,670
该死 太冷了
God damn, it's cold.

1158
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:17,300
为什么 怎么不穿你的羽绒服
Why? What's the matter with your winter jacket?

1159
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:19,180
- 你认真的 小帕  - 把暖气打开
- Seriously, Patty?  - Just turn the heat on.

1160
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:20,250
已经打开了
It's on already.

1161
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:21,490
调高一点
Well, turn it up a little.

1162
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:21,940
已经调到最大了
It's all the way up.

1163
01:11:21,950 --> 01:11:23,090
这吹的是冷气
It's blowing freezing air on me.

1164
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:24,120
它需要预热一下
It just needs a minute to warm up.

1165
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,790
你哪一年买的 一九二八年吗
What year did you get this thing, 1928?

1166
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:28,360
那时候是不是还给你带了匹马
Where's the horse that goes with this fucking car?

1167
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,330
说不定它现在还能哈气
Maybe he can breathe on us.

1168
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:30,260
小帕 我对天发誓
Patty, I swear to god.

1169
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:31,810
我知道 为什么不让我爸在那地方
I know. Why don't we keep my dad in here

1170
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:33,140
再待上三个月
for the next three months?

1171
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:34,190
能省好一笔钱
We'd save a fucking fortune.

1172
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:36,240
你能对尸体冷藏柜的事消停会吗
Would you shut the fuck up about the freezer?

1173
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,330
因为殡仪员和葬礼的事
Want me to have a nervous breakdown

1174
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:38,780
想把我逼疯吗
because there's undertakers and a funeral?

1175
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:40,770
- 谁在意  - 不 我不会
- Who cares?  - No. I don't.

1176
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:47,920
暖和起来了
Okay, it's getting warmer.

1177
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,620
我有个乐队排练 能载我回趟家
I got band practice. Can you drive me home

1178
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:50,280
拿下我的东西
so I can get my stuff

1179
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,250
然后送我去我女朋友家吗
and take me over to my girlfriend's house?

1180
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:55,580
可以
Sure.

1181
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,080
是来家过夜的那个女孩吗
This the same girl who was over at the house?

1182
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:15,190
不是 那天是塞尔维 今天是桑迪
No. That was Sylvie, and this is Sandy.

1183
01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:16,260
她们还不知道彼此的事
They don't know about each other,

1184
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:18,020
所以什么都别说
so, uh, please don't say anything

1185
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:19,380
以免露馅
in case it comes up.

1186
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:21,960
我不会说的
I won't.

1187
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:25,800
你真和这些女孩发生性行为了吗
Do you actually have sex with these girls?

1188
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:28,320
我们总不能只玩电脑游戏吧
We don't just play computer games.

1189
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:29,770
和她们俩都做过吗
With both of them?

1190
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,550
桑迪妈妈在家
Well, with Sandy's mom here,

1191
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:36,850
现在还属于小偷小摸阶段
it's sort of, uh, strictly just like basement business.

1192
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,040
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

1193
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:40,770
意思是我还在努力实现中
It means I'm working on it.

1194
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:58,050
停 奥托 你在干嘛
Stop. Otto, man, what are you doing?

1195
01:13:58,310 --> 01:13:59,230
我怎么了
What did I do?

1196
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:00,760
你没跟上节拍 伙计
You're way behind, man.

1197
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:01,850
我没有
No, I'm not.

1198
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:04,110
你有点没跟上 奥托
You're a little behind, Otto.

1199
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:05,700
你得跟着贝斯的节奏来 奥托
You got to start with the bass, Otto.

1200
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:07,360
伙计 跟着我 好吗
Come on, man, just stay with me, all right?

1201
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:08,370
- 来吧  - 好 不好意思
- Let's go.  - All right, I'm sorry.

1202
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:09,200
没事 来吧
All right. Yeah. Come on.

1203
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,080
没事
It's all right.

1204
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:11,720
来吧
Come on, let's go.

1205
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:13,480
- 开始了 伙计们  - 再来一次
- All right, guys.  - Let's go again.

1206
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,210
奥托 怎么样
Otto, you good?

1207
01:14:14,210 --> 01:14:15,680
- 你好了吗 伙计  - 开始了 伙计
- You good, buddy?  - Let's go, baby.

1208
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:17,180
我来起头
Let me ask stentorian.

1209
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:19,760
一 二 三
1, 2, 3.

1210
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:47,020
你好 你是李吗
Hi. Are you Lee?

1211
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:49,080
我叫吉尔 桑迪的妈妈
I'm Jill, Sandy's mom.

1212

他是个了不起的家伙
He was a terrific guy.

1217
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,510
像他这样的人很少
There's not too many like him.

1218
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:10,610
他是个了不起的父亲
He was a wonderful father.

1219
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,200
谢谢
Thank you.

1220
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:16,730
我 我问一下帕特里克
I was... I was going to ask Patrick

1221
01:15:16,730 --> 01:15:18,640
看他想不想留下来吃晚饭
if he wants to stay for supper,

1222
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,650
如果你觉得没问题的话
if that's okay with you.

1223
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:23,850
你要一起来吗 我做的有点多
You want to join us? I made way too much.

That's all right.

1225

1226
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:40,260
我该几点过来
What time should I come back?

1227
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:44,020
我不知道 九点 九点半
Oh, I don't know. 9, 9:30.

1228
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:47,110
据说他们还要一起“写作业”
They're going to do their homework together, supposedly.

1229
01:15:50,730 --> 01:15:53,370
那好吧 我九点半过来
All right. I'll come back at 9:30.

1230
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:56,040
好 若你十分钟内改变主意了
Okay. When you change your mind in the next ten minutes,

1231
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,220
我们就在里面
we're right inside.

1232
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:59,000
好 谢谢
Okay. Thanks.

1233
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:35,430
我的天 你怎么解开这个
Jesus Christ, how do you unbuckle this?

1234
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:36,440
我指节上的皮都蹭掉了
I'm scraping the skin off my knuckles.

1235
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:39,170
等等 把你手拿出来
Hold on. Just take your hand out.

1236
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:43,040
你能先把你手从我的私处拿出来吗
Would you please just take your hand out of my cunt?

1237
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,400
好 好
Okay. Okay.

1238
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,630
我们要把裤子都脱了吗
Oh, are we taking our pants off?

1239
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:51,830
我要把我的裤子脱了
I'm taking my pants off.

1240
01:16:51,830 --> 01:16:53,000
我不知道你在干吗
I don't know what you're doing.

1241
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,760
我要把我的裤子脱了
I'm taking my pants off.

1242
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:01,760
快点
Come on.

1243
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:04,910
你得先把你的鞋脱了
You got to take your shoe off first.

1244
01:17:04,910 --> 01:17:06,830
- 我的天  - 我在脱了
- Jesus.  - I'm... I'm trying.

1245
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:10,650
孩子们 出来 吃晚饭了
Hey, kids, come on, have some dinner.

1246
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:13,870
好的 妈妈 我们马上下去
Thanks, mom. We'll be right down.

1247
01:17:13,870 --> 01:17:15,550
好的 吉尔 等一下
Thanks, Jill. One second.

1248
01:17:15,550 --> 01:17:16,970
我准备退出登录了
I just got to log off.

1249
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:19,030
你闭嘴好吗 她又不是弱智
Would you shut up? She's not retarded.

1250
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:20,360
你为什么老找我茬
Why are you picking on me?

1251
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:21,610
我没有找你茬
I'm not picking on you.

1252
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:22,710
你会让我惹上麻烦的
You'll get me in trouble.

1253
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:23,720
我们不会惹上麻烦的
We're not gonna get in trouble.

1254
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:24,520
我们会
We are.

1255
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:27,040
我不敢相信你能做出什么
I can't believe what you're gonna do.

1256
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:30,110
数学作业做的怎么样了
How's the math homework?

1257
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:31,050
挺好的
It's good.

1258
01:17:31,150 --> 01:17:32,480
非常令人沮丧
Very frustrating.

1259
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,480
那就好
Good.

1260
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:36,060
那些算法就是个磨人的小妖精
Those algorithms are a bitch.

1261
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:41,210
真的很好吃 吉尔
This is really good, Jill.

1262
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,880
- 谢谢 帕特里克  - 这是
- Thank you, Patrick.  - Is this a...

1263
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,470
这是自制卡本纳拉奶油培根酱吗
this is a homemade carbonara sauce?

1264
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:45,630
我的天 闭嘴吧
Jesus, shut up.

1265
01:17:45,630 --> 01:17:46,570
不是
No.

1266
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:48,190
你在唬我对吧
You could have fooled me.

1267
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,510
我的天
Jesus.

1268
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:50,950
怎么了
What? What?

1269
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,050
你真是个马屁精
You're such a kiss-ass.

1270
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:53,220
- 桑迪  - 怎么了
- Sandy!  - What,

1271
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:55,570
因为我大加赞赏你母亲的厨艺吗
because I appreciate your mother's cooking?

1272
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:03,430
- 晚安  - 晚安
- Good night.  - Good night.

1273
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:08,660
你不想知道发生了什么吗
Aren't you going to ask what happened?

1274
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:10,890
- 我不想知道  - 我猜也是
- I don't want to know.  - Guess not.

1275
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:18,500
国家冰上曲棍球联盟
圣路易斯蓝调队 VS 波士顿棕熊队
2 : 2
决胜点球

1276
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:18,930
加油
Come on.

1277
01:18:31,990 --> 01:18:32,580
你好
Hello.

1278
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:33,850
你好 是李吗
Hello. Lee?

1279
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:35,650
我是兰迪
It's Randi.

1280
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:40,940
- 人呢  - 不好意思 我在
- Hello?  - Yeah. Sorry. I'm here.

1281
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:42,850
- 你好吗  - 不错 你呢
- Hi. How are you?  - Okay. How are you?

1282
01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:44,030
- 挺好的  - 那就好
- Good.  - Good.

1283
01:18:44,370 --> 01:18:45,690
我打电话来是因为
I was just calling...

1284
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,190
乔治告诉我乔的事了
George told me about Joe,

1285
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:48,860
我只是想打个电话慰问一下
and I just wanted to call and say I'm sorry.

1286
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:50,820
希望我没打扰到你
I hope you don't mind me calling.

1287
01:18:50,830 --> 01:18:52,010
没有 我很好 谢谢
No. It's fine. Thank you.

1288
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:53,600
我不介意 你怎么样
I don't mind. How are you?

1289
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:55,910
现在感觉不怎么好
Not so good right now.

1290
01:18:57,070 --> 01:18:58,080
我想我们本应该注意到的
I guess we should have seen it coming,

1291
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,090
但这始终让人难以接受
but it's still hard to believe.

1292
01:19:00,090 --> 01:19:01,610
- 没错  - 是的
- Yeah.  - Yeah.

1293
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:03,760
- 帕特里克怎么样  - 他挺好的
- How's Patrick doing?  - He's good.

1294
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,180
除了流露出来的情感外 当然了
Beyond the obvious, obviously.

1295
01:19:05,180 --> 01:19:07,090
他挺好的 我不太清楚
He's okay. He's fine. I don't know.

1296
01:19:07,090 --> 01:19:08,420
你知道那些孩子 很难看出心事
You know how kids are. It's hard to tell.

1297
01:19:08,430 --> 01:19:09,710
他也没对我坦诚相待
He doesn't really open up with me,

1298
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:11,900
但他看起来不错 他有许多的朋友
but he seems fine. He's got a lot of friends.

1299
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:14,760
- 那就好  - 没错
- Oh, well, that's good.  - Yeah, it is.

1300
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:17,450
我不知道你开始准备后事了没
So I don't know if you'd planned a service yet,

1301
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:19,220
但我想问一下希望你不要介意
but I was also going to ask, if you wouldn't mind,

1302
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:22,040
如果你没问题的话我想过来一趟
I'd like to be there if it's okay with you.

1303
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,060
没事 我不介意
Yeah, it's fine. I don't mind.

1304
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,610
好 谢谢
Okay, okay. Thank you.

1305
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:27,070
这对我真的很重要
It would mean a lot to me.

1306
01:19:27,070 --> 01:19:28,330
不 你应该过来
No, you should come.

1307
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:29,910
我会告诉你具体的时间
I'll let you know when it's going to be.

1308
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:31,680
谢谢
Thank you.

1309
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,290
我能问一下
So can I ask, uh...

1310
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:37,530
你最近怎么样
How are you?

1311
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:41,030
我不知道 你呢
I don't know. How are you?

1312
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:42,660
我不知道
I don't know.

1313
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:45,340
我们现在挺不错的
We're doing pretty well.

1314
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:49,740
我应该告诉你
I should probably tell you.

1315
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:50,490
我准备
I'm going to be a...

1316
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:52,680
事实上 我怀孕了
actually, I'm... I'm pregnant.

1317
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,460
- 是吗  - 是的
- Oh, yeah?  - Yeah.

1318
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:58,670
准备要生了
You know, like, ready to pop.

1319
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:02,570
我还不知道这事
Oh, I didn't know that.

1320
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:05,820
我不知道该不该告诉你
Uh, I didn't know if I should tell you,

1321
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:06,720
但是
but...

1322
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:10,150
没事 恭喜你
No, it's fine. Congratulations.

1323
01:20:10,150 --> 01:20:12,640
谢谢 等你见到我时
Thank you. You would probably decide it for yourself

1324
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:13,740
你就明白了
when you see me.

1325
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:14,650
好吧
Yeah.

1326
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:17,570
那么
So, uh, you know,

1327
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:19,810
我想说
I just wanted to say, you know...

1328
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:21,510
事实上 不好意思
actually, uh, I... oh, sorry.

1329
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:23,100
我不是有意要打断你 我得挂了
I didn't mean to cut you off. I just got to go.

1330
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:24,780
我只是想确定一下我和乔希
I just wanted to make sure it's okay

1331
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:25,690
出席葬礼没问题吧
if me and Josh come to the funeral.

1332
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:28,270
- 完全没问题  - 谢谢你 李
- It's totally okay.  - Thank you, Lee.

1333
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:30,190
好的 上帝保佑
Okay. God bless.

1334
01:20:30,190 --> 01:20:31,630
- 再见  - 拜拜
- So long.  - Bye.

1335
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,830
你在开玩笑吗 我从没去过波士顿
Are you kidding me? I've never even been to Boston.

1336
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,080
你还撑得住吗
So how are you holding up?

1337
01:24:36,190 --> 01:24:37,300
怎么了
What's the matter?

1338
01:24:38,190 --> 01:24:39,100
我说你还撑得住吗
I said how are you holding up?

1339
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:41,490
这问题问得很蠢 来点吃的吗
It's a stupid question. Get some food?

1340
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:44,030
我吃了点奶酪
Oh, uh, I had some cheese.

1341
01:24:44,030 --> 01:24:46,310
你吃了点奶酪 混蛋
You had some cheese, asshole?

1342
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:48,060
我给你拿点吃的
I'll get you something.

1343
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:49,700
- 我什么也不想吃  - 亚尼内
- I don't want anything.  - Hey, Janine!

1344
01:24:49,810 --> 01:24:50,470
- 确定吗  - 什么
- Sure?  - What?

1345
01:24:50,470 --> 01:24:52,300
- 我什么都不想吃  - 没事
- I don't want anything.  - Never mind.

1346
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:54,240
- 什么  - 算了 忽略我
- What?  - Forget it. Skip it.

1347
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:56,150
你说的我什么都听不到

Why not? You don't even have to talk to her.

1365
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:35,530

Sorry. Go to her house or call one of your friends.

1366
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:38,760

Would it be cool with your mom if I came over there?

1368

I have no idea.

1369

1374
01:26:13,330 --> 01:26:15,480
我以为你想呆在爸爸的房间里
I thought maybe you'd want to stay in dad's room.

1375
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,170
为什么 你想我去那间
Hmm? Why, do you want me to?

1376
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:19,790

We're not moving to Boston, uncle Lee.

1381
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:31,140

Well, I don't want to talk about that right now.

1382
01:26:31,140 --> 01:26:33,150
你说他给你留了搬家的钱
You said he left you money so you could move.

1383
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,520
这不意味着
Yeah. That doesn't mean...

1384
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:35,420
不管怎样 波士顿有什么呢
Anyway, what's in Boston?

你是昆西的一个清洁工
You're a janitor in Quincy.

1397
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,460
在哪生活你有什么好在意的
What the hell do you care where you live?

1398
01:27:03,630 --> 01:27:04,840
我要睡了
I got to go to sleep.

1399

1424
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,370

1427
01:29:50,210 --> 01:29:52,070

让我静静
Leave me alone.

1434
01:30:04,210 --> 01:30:05,940
我觉得我不该让你就这么把门关着
I don't think I should let you keep the door shut.

1435
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:07,070

要带你去医院吗
Shall we take you to the hospital?

1441
01:30:15,370 --> 01:30:16,710
不要不要不要
No! No! No!

1442
01:30:17,410 --> 01:30:18,790
我只是有点抓狂
I'm just freakin' out.

1443
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:22,510
好随你 但我不能让你关着门抓狂
Okay, fine, but I can't let you freak out with the door closed.

1444
01:30:24,490 --> 01:30:25,900
如果你每次看到冻鸡肉就要抓狂
And if you're gonna freak out every time

1445
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:28,230
我觉得我们该去医院看看

1446
01:30:28,230 --> 01:30:29,850
我对这方面一点都不懂
I don't know anything about this.

1447
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:34,070
我只是不想他呆在冰柜里
I just don't like him bein' in the freezer!

1448
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:37,440
你已经很清楚地表示过了
You've expressed that very clearly.

1449
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,550
我也不想
I don't like it either.

1450
01:30:38,550 --> 01:30:40,150
我们爱莫能助
There's nothin' we can do about it.

1451
01:30:44,610 --> 01:30:46,190
我不烦你 我就坐在这儿
I'm not gonna bother you. I'm just gonna sit here

1452
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:47,500
等你冷静下来

不能
No.

1456
01:31:25,090 --> 01:31:25,990
好棒
Cool!

1457
01:31:30,940 --> 01:31:32,240
他们给你多少钱
How much are they payin' you?

1458
01:31:33,610 --> 01:31:35,270
最低工资 还有这间房间
Minimum wage plus the room.

1459
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:41,980
好吧
All right.

1460
01:31:43,410 --> 01:31:44,910
我们去买点家具
Let's go get some furniture.

1461
01:31:44,910 --> 01:31:46,030
我有家具
I got furniture.

1462
01:31:48,470 --> 01:31:49,480
你没有
No, you don't.

1463
01:31:50,620 --> 01:31:52,710
这不算家具
This doesn't count as furniture.

1464
01:31:54,290 --> 01:31:55,440
这不算是个房间
This is not a room.

1465
01:31:58,150 --> 01:31:58,930
我们去买点家具
Let's go get some furniture

1466
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:00,070
别烦我了
Get off my back.

1467
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:06,680
小帕过来 我们走
Patty, come on. Let's go.

1468
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:12,860
走吧
Let's go.

1469
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:29,160
好了
There we go.

1470
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:33,880
好了
All right.

1471
01:32:34,410 --> 01:32:35,330
好多了吧
Better?

1472
01:32:36,630 --> 01:32:37,600
好多了
Better.

1473
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:46,760
听着
So, listen.

1474
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:53,240
我们呆在这里直到你学校放假
We can stay here until your school lets out.

1475
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:56,230
好吗
Okay?

1476
01:32:56,260 --> 01:32:58,970
这样我就有时间在波士顿好好安置一下
That'll give me time to set things up in Boston better.

1477
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:01,020
如果你愿意可以在暑假和乔治一起干点活
Maybe you can do some stuff with George in the summer

1478
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:02,390
你的生活也不会一夜间
if you want, and you don't get jerked

1479
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:03,900
翻天覆地
out of your life overnight.

1480
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:06,710
好吗
Okay?

1481
01:33:07,550 --> 01:33:09,100
你是询问我的意见还是通知我
Are you askin' me or tellin' me?

1482
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:13,930
- 这是我能做到最好的方式了  - 那你他妈管我愿不愿意
- I'm tellin' you that's the best I can do.  - Then what the fuck do you care whether it's okay with me or not?

1483
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:18,040
才四十五分钟的路
It's 45 minutes away.

1484
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:19,680
- 你想回来随时都可以  - 从昆西回来
- You can come back here any time you want.  - From Quincy?

1485
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:20,180
对啊
Yeah.

1486
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:21,700
要一个多小时 开玩笑吗
It's an hour and a... is that a joke?

1487
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:22,600
至少要一个半小时
It's an hour and a half at least!

1488
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:24,880
- 没开玩笑  - 你要考虑其他车辆因素
- No, it's not.  - You gotta include the other cars!

1489
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,660
你坐宇宙飞船也不可能
You couldn't get from here to Roxbury in half an hour

1490
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:28,450
半小时飞到罗克斯伯里
if you flew in a fuckin' spaceship!

1491
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:29,650
好 去你的
Okay, fuck it.

1492
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:38,840
我要午饭钱
I need lunch money.

1493
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:40,930
- 帕特里克  - 帕特里克
- Hey, Patrick!  - Hey, Patrick!

1494
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:43,000
- 帕特里克  - 帕特里克 帕特里克
- Hey, Patrick!  - Patrick! Patrick!

1495
01:33:43,470 --> 01:33:45,020
你会去福音吗
So, are you going to godspell?

1496
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:46,370
我还在考虑
I'm thinking about it.

1497
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:47,610
好吧 拜拜
All right, 'Kay. Bye.

1498
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:50,990
那些也是你女朋友
Those your girlfriends, too?

1499
01:33:51,390 --> 01:33:52,360
她们倒是想啊
They wish.

1500
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:56,870
你在乔治船上工作他不给你钱吗
Doesn't George give you money for working on his boat?

1501
01:33:56,870 --> 01:33:57,980
给的 但我要存下来
Yeah, but I'm savin' that.

1502
01:33:57,980 --> 01:33:59,810
- 干吗用  - 买新马达
- For what?  - New motor.

1503
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:02,680
你要去福音
You going to godspell?

1504
01:35:46,670 --> 01:35:47,740
拜托
Aw, come on.

1505
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:53,430
拜托
Aw, come on!

1506
01:35:56,740 --> 01:35:57,610
你好
Hello.

1507
01:35:57,610 --> 01:35:58,890
你好 李吗
Hello, Lee?

1508
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:01,600
李
Lee?

1509
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:05,080
李 是你吗
Lee, is that you?

1510
01:36:05,980 --> 01:36:06,850
你好
Hello?

1511
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:16,150
你手怎么了
What happened to your hand?

1512
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:18,340
割到了
I cut it.

1513
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:20,640
有那么一瞬间我知道怎么回事
Oh. For a minute there I didn't know what happened.

1514
01:36:31,290 --> 01:36:32,610
你有什么理由不告诉我
Is there some reason why you didn't tell me

1515
01:36:32,610 --> 01:36:34,130
我妈妈想给我打电话
my mom tried to call me?

1516
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:45,010
她写邮件给我说你把她挂掉了
She wrote me you hung up on her.

1517
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:48,130
她在艾塞克斯
She's in Essex.

1518
01:36:48,370 --> 01:36:51,700
她希望我去吃个午饭 见见她未婚夫
She wants me to come have lunch and meet her fiance.

1519
01:36:54,860 --> 01:36:55,860
你怎么想的
What'd you think?

1520
01:36:55,860 --> 01:36:57,410
她不能联系我
She couldn't get in touch with me?

1521
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:02,870
我挂电话是因为我不知道和她说什么
I hung up on her because I didn't know what to say to her.

1522
01:37:03,090 --> 01:37:03,760
我没告诉你是因为
And I didn't tell you because

1523
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,340
因为我不知道该怎么和你说
'cause I didn't know what to say to you.

1524
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:06,700
对不起
I'm sorry.

1525
01:37:07,170 --> 01:37:08,830
你不能阻止我和她联系
You can't stop me talkin' to her.

1526
01:37:09,730 --> 01:37:11,380
我才不管你要做什么
I don't give a shit what you do.

1527
01:37:12,550 --> 01:37:14,980
你不管 但你却不让我女朋友在这儿过夜
No, but you won't let my girlfriend stay over,

1528
01:37:14,980 --> 01:37:17,650
你讨厌我妈以至于她打电话过来都不肯告诉我
you hate my mother so much you won't even tell me she called.

1529
01:37:17,650 --> 01:37:19,630
你宁愿把我带去昆西市 毁了我的生活
You'd rather drag me back to Quincy and ruin my life

1530
01:37:19,630 --> 01:37:21,280
也不愿让其他人成为我的监护人
than let somebody else be my guardian...

1531
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:22,290
没有什么其他人
There is nobody else.

1532
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:24,380
我可以和我妈住在埃塞克斯
I can live in Essex with my mom.

1533
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:27,190
不 不可以
No, you can't.

1534
01:37:27,330 --> 01:37:28,670
她已经不是酒鬼了
She's not an alcoholic anymore

1535
01:37:28,670 --> 01:37:29,810
她想让我和她住一起
and she wants me to stay with her,

1536
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:31,140
那样就可以解决我们的问题了
then that solves all our problems.

1537
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:33,420
我仍可以搭同一辆公交去原来的学校
I can take the same bus to my same school

1538
01:37:33,550 --> 01:37:35,030
和我所有的朋友在一起
and keep all my friends,

1539
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:37,250
留住小船 你也可以回到波士顿
and the boat, and you can go back to Boston,

1540
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:39,220
还可以回来看看我什么的 如果你想的话
and still check in on me, or whatever, if you want to...

1541
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:39,940
我做不到
I can't do that.

1542
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:40,880
为什么不行
Why not?

1543
01:37:42,180 --> 01:37:44,830
小帕 很抱歉我挂了她电话
Patty, I'm sorry I hung up on her.

1544
01:37:45,810 --> 01:37:46,940
我会再打给她
I'll call her back,

1545
01:37:47,210 --> 01:37:48,480
如果她听上去还像半个人的话
and if she seems semi-human to me,

1546
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:50,480
你可以和她以及她的未婚夫共进午餐
you can go have lunch with her and her fiance.

1547
01:37:50,510 --> 01:37:51,230
就这样
That's it.

1548
01:37:51,230 --> 01:37:53,050
我不想再多说什么了
I don't wanna talk about this anymore.

1549
01:38:05,010 --> 01:38:06,290
好的 一旦到达安全地带
Okay, soon as we're clear,

1550
01:38:06,290 --> 01:38:08,050
马上打开它 然后再见机行事
open it up and we'll see what we can do.

1551
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:09,430
好的
Okay.

1552
01:38:22,820 --> 01:38:23,710
李
Lee?

1553
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:25,710
最近怎么样
Hey, what do you say?

1554
01:38:25,710 --> 01:38:27,660
- 你还好吗  - 我很好 你呢
- How are you?  - Yeah, I'm good. How are you?

1555
01:38:27,660 --> 01:38:28,570
还好
All right.

1556
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:30,970
乔的事情 请节哀顺变
I'm really, uh... I'm really sorry to hear about Joe.

1557
01:38:30,970 --> 01:38:32,350
心领了 谢谢
I know, yeah, thanks.

1558
01:38:32,350 --> 01:38:33,350
帕特里克怎么样
How's Patrick doing?

1559
01:38:33,350 --> 01:38:34,400
- 不错  - 是吗
- Good.  - Yeah?

1560
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:35,640
- 是的  - 那就好
- Yeah.  - Good.

1561
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:36,810
怎么了 你来这儿…
What's going on? What are ya...

1562
01:38:36,820 --> 01:38:37,470
我回来了
You know, I'm back,

1563
01:38:37,470 --> 01:38:38,930
我打算在这儿待到夏天结束
I'm thinking about staying through the summer.

1564
01:38:38,930 --> 01:38:40,170
我想看看你这儿有没有什么工作
I was wondering if you had any work.

1565
01:38:40,170 --> 01:38:41,710
打发打发时间
I'm looking to pick up some hours.

1566
01:38:41,710 --> 01:38:42,710
当然有 有
Sure, sure.

1567
01:38:43,090 --> 01:38:44,490
沃尔特去波士顿了 所以…
Walt is down in Boston, so...

1568
01:38:44,490 --> 01:38:45,930
- 是吗  - 对 他应该明天回来
- Oh, he is?  - Yeah, he should be back tomorrow

1569
01:38:45,930 --> 01:38:47,630
- 你要是想过来  - 他明天回来吗
- if you want to come by.  - He's coming back up tomorrow?

1570
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:48,240
对 给他打个电话
Yeah, yeah. Give him a call.

1571
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:50,120
好 我会给他电话的
Okay. I will give him a call.

1572
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:51,280
- 那样挺好  - 我会打的
- That's a good idea.  - I'll do that.

1573
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:52,970
- 没问题  - 好 好
- Absolutely.  - Okay. All right.

1574
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:55,460
- 很好  - 很高兴见到你

1575
01:38:55,460 --> 01:38:56,730
- 谢了 杰里  - 不客气
- Thanks, Jerry.  - All right.

1576
01:39:05,860 --> 01:39:07,510
我不想再在这儿见到他
I don't want to see him in here again.

1577
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:04,430
帕特里克 再见
Bye, Patrick.

1578
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:06,790
周日要去看足球比赛吗
Want to watch the football game on Sunday?

1579
01:40:06,790 --> 01:40:08,280
- 好啊  - 帕特里克 再见
- Sure.  - So long, Patrick.

1580
01:40:12,130 --> 01:40:13,810
- 帕特里克 再见  - 再见
- Bye, Patrick.  - See you guys.

1581
01:40:14,890 --> 01:40:15,990
发动机什么情况
How's the motor?

1582
01:40:16,850 --> 01:40:18,310
乔治说活塞随时可能会
George says the piston's gonna go right

1583
01:40:18,310 --> 01:40:20,030
卡进缸体
through the block any minute now.

1584
01:40:21,250 --> 01:40:22,940
不幸的是 那是个问题
Unfortunately that's a problem.

1585
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:26,300
我们负担不起一艘不能运转的船
We can't afford to keep a boat if we can't run it,

1586
01:40:26,310 --> 01:40:28,200
船的发动机坏了的话就运转不了了
and we can't run it if it's got a broken motor.

1587
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:29,420
那我们就去贷款
Let's take out a loan.

1588
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:31,030
然后用什么还呢
And pay it back with what?

1589
01:40:31,330 --> 01:40:34,310
我们把它租出去啊 直到挣回贷款的钱
We hire it out 'til we pay the loan back, obviously.

1590
01:40:35,870 --> 01:40:37,100
对你来说 不幸的是
Unfortunately for you,

1591
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:40,670
在你满二十一岁之前 你的财产都是归我负责
I'm in charge of your finances until you turn 21,

1592
01:40:40,670 --> 01:40:43,810
我不太想替你申请巨额贷款
and I'm not comfortable takin' out enormous loans on your behalf.

1593
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:46,840
我的乐队还要训练
I have band practice.

1594
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:48,440
你能先带我回家拿上东西
Can you drive me home to get my stuff

1595
01:40:48,450 --> 01:40:50,440
再送我去桑迪家吗
then drive me over to Sandy's house?

1596
01:40:58,320 --> 01:40:59,300
好啊
Sure.

1597
01:41:02,670 --> 01:41:04,140
你为什么不去考个驾照 我不是你的专职司机
Why don't you take a drivers'ed course? I'm not your chauffeur.

1598
01:41:04,140 --> 01:41:06,750
因为爸爸让我答应他十七岁之前不要开车
'Cause dad made me promise not to drive 'til I was 17.

1599
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:08,960
好吧 那我们还是听你爸的吧
Okay, we'll stick with that then.

1600
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:18,850
你要留下来吃晚饭吗
Do you wanna stay for dinner?

1601
01:41:18,950 --> 01:41:20,720
我觉得桑迪的妈妈喜欢你
I think Sandy's mother likes you.

1602
01:41:20,970 --> 01:41:22,050
不 哪有
No, she doesn't.

1603
01:41:22,050 --> 01:41:23,870
我知道她确实喜欢你
I happen to know that she does.

1604
01:41:27,390 --> 01:41:29,160
这可能对我们俩都有好处
This could be good for both of us.

1605
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:35,870
我还是不去了吧
I'd really rather not.

1606
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:40,650
那至少 你能不能和她待半个小时
Well, can you at least just like hang out with her for half an hour

1607
01:41:40,650 --> 01:41:41,850
所以我可以在没有桑迪她妈
so I can be alone with Sandy

1608
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:44,220
每二十秒敲一次门的打扰下和她单独相处吗
without her mother knockin' on the door every twenty seconds?

1609
01:41:44,220 --> 01:41:45,340
你够了
Come on, man.

1610
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:47,060
你只需要和她说说话
All you gotta do is talk to her.

1611
01:41:47,170 --> 01:41:48,860
除了拉着我去见律师
Why can't you help me out a little bit for once

1612
01:41:48,860 --> 01:41:50,230
去殡仪馆和太平间
instead of draggin' me to the lawyers

1613
01:41:50,230 --> 01:41:52,060
你为什么就不能帮我一次
and the funeral parlor and the morgue?

1614
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:53,640
况且她真的很不错
Anyway, she's really nice.

1615
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:56,800
[响亮乐队]

1616
01:41:56,810 --> 01:41:57,920
告诉我为什么
Tell me why

1617
01:42:00,730 --> 01:42:02,870
为什么
Why

1618
01:42:04,330 --> 01:42:06,160
你为什么需要我
Why do you need me

1619
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:07,790
你为什么想要我
Why do you want me

1620
01:42:07,790 --> 01:42:10,180
- 停停停 停  - 你为什么爱我

- Otto...  - What, I'm too slow?

1622

1625
01:42:16,550 --> 01:42:18,910
老兄 你像是比我快一站还不止
Dude, you're like pulling out of the fucking station ahead of me.

1626
01:42:18,910 --> 01:42:20,820
天啊 你们 随他去吧
Oh my god, you guys, leave him alone.

1627
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:22,530
老兄 你是认真对待这个乐队吗
Dude, like, are you serious about this band, or what?

1628
01:42:22,530 --> 01:42:23,800
好了 行了行了
Okay, all right, all right.

1629
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:25,960
- 饶了他吧  - 少废话

1630
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:27,880
好吧 大家都冷静点
All right, everybody just chill here.

1631
01:42:27,890 --> 01:42:30,570
我们…我们继续
Let's just, um...let's just go again.

1632
01:42:33,390 --> 01:42:35,160
我们是响亮乐队

1633
01:42:43,070 --> 01:42:45,810
帕特里克是我最喜欢的人之一

不过我们正忙着呢
But we're right in the middle of something.

1638
01:43:08,060 --> 01:43:11,460
我们正在做繁分数
We're just banging out those compound fractions.

1639
01:43:12,670 --> 01:43:14,720
至少我们知道他们在哪里 对吗
At least we know where they are, right?

1640
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:17,490
那倒是
That's true.

1641
01:43:22,150 --> 01:43:24,060
你得找多少个才能
How many of those you generally gotta go through

1642
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:25,010
选出一个你喜欢的
before you pick a winner?

1643
01:43:25,010 --> 01:43:26,910
我倒想看看你在各种打扰的情况下
I'd like to see you use one of these goddamn things

1644
01:43:26,910 --> 01:43:28,490
用一次这个鬼东西

我被你的玩偶之家绊倒了
I tripped over your fuckin' doll house.

1648
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:35,870
天啊 你有没有把它摔坏
Oh my god, did you break it?

1649
01:43:35,870 --> 01:43:37,960
我不知道 不过我没事
I don't know. I'm fine though, by the way.

1650
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:38,640
我的天
Oh my god.

1651
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:40,710
那是我五岁的时候我外婆给我的
My grandmother gave me that when I was five years old.

1652
01:43:40,710 --> 01:43:42,860
那还是她小时候玩的玩偶之家
It was literally her doll house from when she was a little girl.

1653
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:44,330
那为什么把它放在地上
Then what's it doin' on the fuckin' floor?

1654
01:43:44,330 --> 01:43:46,710
玩偶之家不在地上玩在哪玩
It's a doll house, that's where you play with it!

1655
01:43:46,710 --> 01:43:48,790
孩子们 上面怎么了
Kids, what is going on up there?

Nothing! Patrick just stubbed his toe on mummer's doll house,

1657
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:52,540
不过没什么事
but it's okay!

1658
01:43:52,540 --> 01:43:54,720
桑迪 那是我妈的娃娃屋
Sandy, that doll house belonged to my mother.

1659
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:56,300
- 我知道 妈妈  - 如果你把它摔碎了
- Yes I know, mom.  - If you're gonna smash it to pieces...

1660
01:43:56,310 --> 01:43:57,720
没人要把它摔成碎片 它没事
Nobody is smashin' it to pieces! It's fine!

1661

吉尔 别担心 我没事
Don't worry, Jill, I'm okay.

1662

我的脚趾也会好的
My toe's gonna be okay.

1663
01:44:04,860 --> 01:44:06,420
你到底想不想上我
Do you want to fuck me or not?

1664
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:07,430
想
Yes.

1665
01:44:12,280 --> 01:44:14,600
要再给你拿杯啤酒吗 李

1666

01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:53,020
我说了“阿门”
I did say "Amen".

1755
01:48:53,030 --> 01:48:54,410
说了吗 好吧
Oh, you did? Okay.

1756
01:48:54,410 --> 01:48:55,710
你不是非得要说的
Well, you don't have to.

1757
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:58,310
我知道 我只是说得很小声
Yeah, I know. I just said it really quietly.

1758
01:48:59,230 --> 01:49:00,770
没关系 亲爱的
It's fine, honey.

1759
01:49:00,770 --> 01:49:03,010
我知道我会让你感到惊讶
Look, I know I'm gonna be a shock to you.

1760
01:49:03,140 --> 01:49:04,330
很多方面都会
In a lot of ways.

1761
01:49:04,820 --> 01:49:06,350
希望是好的惊喜
I'm hoping it's a good shock.

1762
01:49:06,910 --> 01:49:07,820
是的
Yeah.

1763
01:49:08,140 --> 01:49:09,570
你还需要什么吗 帕特里克
You need anything else, Patrick?

1764
01:49:09,570 --> 01:49:10,800
我希望食物都合你口味
I hope everything's okay.

1765
01:49:10,810 --> 01:49:12,740
是的 食物都很好吃
Oh yeah, everything's great.

1766
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:14,890
你跟我说话不需要这么正式
You don't have to be so formal.

1767
01:49:14,890 --> 01:49:15,900
我没有
I'm not.

1768
01:49:16,580 --> 01:49:18,180
你妈妈是希望你…
I think your mother wants you to feel...

1769
01:49:18,180 --> 01:49:22,770
我想说的是 这里也是你的家
I'm just sayin' that this is your home, too.

1770
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:24,510
希望你把这当成家
I want it to be.

1771
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:27,270
我知道…
And I know...

1772
01:49:27,530 --> 01:49:28,750
我知道…
I know, uh...

1773
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:30,790
你的生活发生了许多改变
Things are different for you.

1774
01:49:31,790 --> 01:49:33,410
算了 我也说不好
Anyway, I don't know.

1775
01:49:33,410 --> 01:49:34,530
没关系
That's okay.

1776
01:49:40,410 --> 01:49:42,390
你在学校学些什么呢 帕特里克
What are you studying at school, Patrick?

1777
01:49:42,790 --> 01:49:46,030
都是平常的东西
Oh, well, the usual stuff.

1778
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:49,060
我去去就回来
You know what? I'm gonna be right back.

1779
01:49:49,190 --> 01:49:51,000
你们需要我从厨房拿点什么吗
Does anybody need anything from the kitchen?

1780
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,470
- 不用 谢谢 谢谢  - 不用了
- No, thanks. Thank you.  - I'm good, no.

1781
01:50:02,870 --> 01:50:04,450
豆角你尝过了吗
Did you get some string beans?

1782
01:50:05,660 --> 01:50:07,620
还没 谢谢
Oh, no, not yet. Thank you.

1783
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:10,180
我去…
Let me, um...

1784
01:50:11,550 --> 01:50:13,190
我去看看她在里头干吗
Let me just see what she's doin' in there.

1785
01:50:28,010 --> 01:50:29,560
她是什么样的人
So what was she like?

1786
01:50:31,510 --> 01:50:33,770
说不好 她挺紧张的
I don't know. She was pretty nervous.

1787
01:50:34,470 --> 01:50:35,460
是吗
Yeah?

1788
01:50:36,790 --> 01:50:38,310
那个男人呢
What was that guy like?

1789
01:50:38,910 --> 01:50:40,230
很虔诚的基督教徒
He was very Christian.

1790
01:50:44,430 --> 01:50:45,990
你知道我们也是基督教徒吧
You know, we're Christian, too, right?

1791
01:50:45,990 --> 01:50:47,210
我知道
Yes, I know that.

1792
01:50:47,790 --> 01:50:50,000
你知道天主教也属于基督教吧
You are aware that catholics are christians?

1793
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,560
我知道
Yes, I am aware of that.

1794
01:50:55,550 --> 01:50:58,510
反正她听起来比以前好多了
Well, it sounds like she's doing better, anyway.

1795
01:50:58,850 --> 01:51:00,310
她没酗酒了
She's not drinking.

1796
01:51:01,250 --> 01:51:02,610
也没在精神病院
She's not in the psych ward.

1797
01:51:07,970 --> 01:51:08,990
怎么了
Wow, what?

1798
01:51:10,530 --> 01:51:12,100
你为了甩掉我 真是什么都做得出来
You'll do anything to get rid of me.

1799
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:13,630
- 什么  - 你听到了
- What?  - You heard me.

1800
01:51:15,870 --> 01:51:17,090
不是那样的
That's not true.

1801
01:51:29,130 --> 01:51:30,230
亲爱的帕特里克
Dear Patrick,

1802
01:51:30,230 --> 01:51:32,210
我写信是要感谢你今天的拜访
I'm writing to thank you for today.

1803
01:51:32,210 --> 01:51:34,100
你的到来对你妈妈意义重大
Your visit meant the world to your mom.

1804
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:36,370
你愿意重新进入她的生活 代表了你对她的爱和信任
We are both deeply grateful for the love and trust

1805
01:51:36,370 --> 01:51:38,880
为此我们两个都十分感恩
you've shown by offering to rejoin her life,

1806
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:41,490
然而催促她踏上这段漫长而充满挑战的路途
but I feel it would be unfair to your mom to rush her along

1807
01:51:41,490 --> 01:51:43,750
对你妈妈来说很不公平
the long and challenging road ahead,

1808
01:51:43,750 --> 01:51:45,490
所以以后请你写信给我
and so I'm going to ask you to write to me

1809
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:48,850
来安排进一步的见面
in future to arrange any further visits.

1810
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:51,200
希望你不要觉得我在干涉你
I hope you won't take this as an intrusion...

1811
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:16,420
你的朋友们今晚在哪
where are your friends tonight?

1812
01:52:16,420 --> 01:52:17,300
不知道
I don't know.

1813
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:21,770
不如你打电话给叫桑迪那个女孩
Why don't you call that girl Sandy,

1814
01:52:22,100 --> 01:52:24,060
- 看她要不要过来  - 不用了 谢谢
- see if she'll come over?  - No, thanks.

1815
01:52:24,950 --> 01:52:26,210
不过想法不错
Nice try, though.

1816
01:52:50,230 --> 01:52:51,960
你要朝谁开枪 你还是我
Who are you going to shoot, you or me?

1817
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:54,840
你知道这些值多少钱吗
Do you know what these things are worth?

1818
01:52:54,980 --> 01:52:56,060
不知道
No.

1819
01:52:57,840 --> 01:52:58,670
我想把它们卖掉
Want to try and sell them

1820
01:52:58,670 --> 01:53:00,410
这样就能给你的船买个发动机了
so you can have a motor for the boat?

1821
01:53:03,710 --> 01:53:05,170
这真是个好主意
That's a really good idea.

1822
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:21,200
太棒了
This is awesome.

1823
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:22,280
太棒了
This is awesome.

1824
01:53:22,620 --> 01:53:23,740
你想开吗
Do you want to drive?

1825
01:53:24,310 --> 01:53:25,160
当然了
Sure.

1826
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:26,060
好的
All right.

1827
01:53:27,010 --> 01:53:28,360
天啊
Oh! Oh, my god!

1828
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:29,440
- 真抱歉  - 没关系
- I'm so sorry.  - That's all right.

1829
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:30,740
没关系 把船开直就好
That's all right. That's all right. Just straighten her out.

1830
01:53:30,740 --> 01:53:32,370
- 天啊  - 把她开直
- Oh, my god.  - Straighten her out.

1831
01:53:33,180 --> 01:53:35,330
- 没事的  - 对不起
- That's okay.  - Sorry.

1832
01:53:58,830 --> 01:53:59,970
我得去处理一些杂事
Hey, I got to run some chores.

1833
01:53:59,980 --> 01:54:01,570
几小时后就回来
I'll be back in a couple hours.

1834
01:54:01,570 --> 01:54:03,160
- 想要我带点什么吗  - 不用 谢了
- You want anything?  - No, thank you.

1835
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:04,020
不用了 谢谢 钱德勒先生
No, thanks, Mr. Chandler.

1836
01:54:04,020 --> 01:54:05,000
谢谢
Thank you.

1837
01:54:09,070 --> 01:54:10,510
多好的城市
Set-up city.

1838
01:54:10,590 --> 01:54:11,690
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

1839
01:54:11,690 --> 01:54:13,380
不是吗 那塞尔维·麦甘恩呢
Oh, yeah? How Sylvie McGann?

1840
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:14,350
谁
Who?

1841
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:15,670
快开门吧
Just open the door.

1842
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:50,050
我不认为这是我们的责任 不过…
I didn't think it was our responsibility, but...

1843
01:54:50,050 --> 01:54:52,000
对啊 他们本可以…
Yeah, I guess. I mean, they could have...

1844
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:52,900
没事的
it's okay.

1845
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:53,920

1846
01:54:56,780 --> 01:54:57,740

And this is Dylan.

1851
01:55:11,650 --> 01:55:13,210
你看不清他的脸
You can't see him too good.

1852
01:55:14,170 --> 01:55:15,200
你好 迪伦
Hi, Dylan.

1853
01:55:16,340 --> 01:55:17,590
很帅啊
Very handsome.

1854
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:21,270
兰迪 我去开车过来接你吧
Randi, you want me to get the car and pick you up?

1855
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:23,320
- 好  - 没事 我要走了
- Yeah.  - That's okay. I got to go.

1856
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:25,030
其实我们能不能
Actually, could... could we, uh,

1857
01:55:25,620 --> 01:55:27,020
能不能聊一会
could we talk for a second?

1858
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,480
- 当然  - 好的
- Sure.  - Okay.

1859

- Yeah. You, too.  - Be right back.

1862
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:50,120
我没什么重要的事要说
I don't have anything big to say.

1863
01:55:50,120 --> 01:55:51,130
没关系
That's okay.

1864
01:55:52,140 --> 01:55:53,050
我只是…
I just...

1865
01:55:54,760 --> 01:55:56,410
我知道你回来了 我…
I know you've been around, and I...

1866
01:55:56,410 --> 01:55:58,900
我一直忙着安顿帕特里克
I've just been getting Patrick settled in.

1867
01:55:59,510 --> 01:56:01,230
他好像适应得还不错
It seems like he's doing pretty good, huh?

1868
01:56:01,230 --> 01:56:02,270
总的来说
Considering.

1869
01:56:02,980 --> 01:56:04,810
我觉得挺不错了
I think he is, yeah.

1870
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:07,560
你可能不知道
I guess you don't know this,

1871
01:56:07,570 --> 01:56:08,570
但我…
but I, uh...

1872
01:56:10,230 --> 01:56:11,730
我一直跟乔伊保持着联系
I really kept in touch with Joe.

1873
01:56:11,730 --> 01:56:12,620
- 我知道  - 这阵子见不到帕特里克
- No, I knew that.  - It's been kind of weird

1874
01:56:12,620 --> 01:56:15,040
我觉得有点怪怪的 好吧
for me not seeing Patrick. Oh. Oh, okay.

1875
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:16,350
我以为你不知道
I... I didn't know.

1876
01:56:17,750 --> 01:56:19,260
你想见他就去见吧
Uh, you could see him if you want.

1877
01:56:19,260 --> 01:56:20,880
我们还能一起吃午餐吗
Could we ever have lunch?

1878
01:56:23,630 --> 01:56:25,150
你是指你和我吗
You mean us, you and me?

1879
01:56:25,150 --> 01:56:26,080
是的
Yeah.

1880
01:56:28,810 --> 01:56:30,250
因为我…
Because I, uh...

1881
01:56:37,470 --> 01:56:39,530
我以前对你说了很多过分的话
I said a lot of terrible things to you.

1882
01:56:39,530 --> 01:56:40,460
没有
No.

1883
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:42,520
可是我…
But I...

1884
01:56:42,700 --> 01:56:44,090
我知道你从来没有…
I know you never...

1885
01:56:47,470 --> 01:56:49,260
可能你不想跟我说话了
maybe you don't want to talk to me.

1886
01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:51,360
- 不是这样的  - 让我说完
- It's not that.  - Let me finish.

1887
01:56:53,540 --> 01:56:54,470
无论…
However...

1888
01:56:56,790 --> 01:56:58,530
我的心已经支离破碎
my heart was broken.

1889
01:57:01,420 --> 01:57:03,680
永远都无法愈合
It's always going to be broken.

1890
01:57:05,700 --> 01:57:07,870
我知道你的心也碎了
And I know yours is broken, too.

1891
01:57:10,450 --> 01:57:12,410
但我不用背负…
But I don't have to carry...

1892
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:15,970

你愿意的话可以回来住
Then you come back and stay if you want.

当你到二十一岁了就可以把房子卖了
When you turn 21, you're allowed to sell it

2019

2023
02:05:37,850 --> 02:05:40,790
要是真拿到了
then we can... we can just figure that out

2024
02:05:40,790 --> 02:05:42,300
再做讨论也不迟
when it happens.

2025
02:05:43,670 --> 02:05:45,250
我还是受托人
I'm still the trustee.

2026

2029
02:05:51,130 --> 02:05:52,620
除了你不用搬家了

谢谢 但 谁
Thank you, but, like, who's...

2031
02:05:59,490 --> 02:06:01,610
是他们当我的监护人还是你
Are they going to be my guardians, or are you going...

2032
02:06:01,620 --> 02:06:03,060
他们打算收养你
They're going to adopt you.

2033

总之 这是我的计划

2034
02:06:14,260 --> 02:06:16,000
你不必勉强 由你决定
You don't have to. It's up to you.

2035
02:06:18,670 --> 02:06:20,010
所以你就这么一走了之吗
So you're just going to disappear?

2036

我这么计划是想让你待在这

他们很高兴能收养你
And they're really glad to have you.

- 他们  - 我知道 我知道

他们是很好 但
I mean, they're great, but...

2042
02:06:36,150 --> 02:06:37,810
你为什么不能留下
Why can't you stay?

2043
02:06:38,930 --> 02:06:40,260
小帕

2044
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:51,870
