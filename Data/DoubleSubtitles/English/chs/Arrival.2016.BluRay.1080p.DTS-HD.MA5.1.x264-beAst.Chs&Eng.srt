For now, we're simply asking for cooperation

70
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,070
我们只希望大家能够配合
while authorities assess the object.

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,830
你们从哪里来
Where did you come from?

143
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,350
现在你听过了 你有什么想法吗
Now you heard it. What do you make of it?

144
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,270
那就是
Is that...

145
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,990
是的
Yes.

146
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,950
有多少
How many?

147
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,870
- 什么有多少  - 有多少在说话
- How many what?  - Um, how many, um, speaking?

148
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,510
两个
Two.

149
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,350
假设它们不是同时在说话
Assume they were not speaking at the same time.

150
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,550
你确定吗 它们有嘴吗
Are you sure? Did they have mouths...

151
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,070
你要是翻译这个的话 你怎么做
How would you approach translating this?

152
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,070
你有没有听到什么词汇 短语
Do you hear any words? Phrases?

153
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,190
我不 我不知道
I don't... I don't know.

154
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,990
那你能告诉我什么吗
So what can you tell me?

155
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,270
我能说的就是不可能仅根据音频文件
I can tell you that it's impossible

156
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,310
来翻译这些
to translate from an audio file.

157
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,510
我得亲自到现场 跟它们进行互动
I would need to be there, to interact with them.

158
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,550
做波斯语翻译的时候你也没互动啊
You didn't need that with the Farsi translations.

159
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,430
我不需要是因为我会波斯语
I didn't need it because I already knew the language,

160
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,630
但是这个 这是 呃
but this... This is... Ah...

161
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,860
我知道你想干什么
I know what you're doing.

162
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,870
- 那你说说我在要干嘛  - 我是不会带你去蒙大拿的
- Tell me what I'm doing.  - I'm not taking you to Montana.

163
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,050
我不能让别人把最高机密许可
It's all I can do to keep it from turning into a tourist site

164
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,370
当成旅游景点的门票
for everybody who has a TS clearance.

165
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,390
我只是告诉你完成这项工作
I'm just telling you what it would take

166
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,870
需要什么
to do this job.

167
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,390
我不是来商量的
This is not a negotiation.

168
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,180
如果我离开这里 你就没机会了
If I leave here, your chance is gone.

169
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,910
再见
Good day.

170
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,790
上校
Colonel?

171
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,950
你刚才说伯克利
You mentioned Berkeley.

172
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,350
接下来你是不是要去询问丹佛斯
Are you going to ask Danvers next?

173
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,750
可能吧
Maybe.

174
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,220
在你让他工作之前
Before you commit to him,

175
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,950
问问他梵文里战争一词及其翻译
ask him the Sanskrit word for war and its translation.

176
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,310
在今晚的中国和俄罗斯在联合国加入磋商后
An agreement on sharing scientific discoveries

177
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,030
有望达成
looks closer tonight,

178
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,710
一个科学发现共享协议
as Russia and China join talks at the United Nations.

179
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,270
与此同时 世界范围内的金融市场处于危机中
Meanwhile, financial markets across the world are in crisis

180
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,510
道琼斯工业指数下跌
as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell

181
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,190
超过两千点
over 2,000 points...

182
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
早上好
Morning.

183
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
上校

伽维斯提
Gavisti.

185
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,310
他说这表示“争论”
He says it means "An argument."

186
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,870
你觉得那个词是什么意思
What do you say it means?

187
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,510
渴望更多的牛
A desire for more cows.

188

班克斯博士 这边请
Dr. Banks. Right this way, please.

191
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,430
收到 准备前往
Contact and ready to approach...

192
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,000
抱歉 班克斯博士 我来检查一下你的安全带
Excuse me, Dr. Banks, let me make sure you're properly secured.

193
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,500
你还好吗
You okay?

194
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,550
对不起 我刚才没听见你在说什么
Sorry, I couldn't hear what you were saying.

195
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,550
“语言”是文明的基石
"Language is the foundation of civilization.

196
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,020
它是将人们联结在一起的胶水

197
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,950
它是在冲突中最先使用的武器
"It is the first weapon drawn in a conflict."

198

露易丝 这是伊恩・唐纳利 露易丝・班克斯 伊恩・唐纳利
Louise, this is Ian Donnelly. Louise Banks, Ian Donnelly.

199
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,270
这就是打过招呼了
That's quite a greeting.

200
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,270
是啊 你写的这个
Yeah, well, you wrote it.

201
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,950
嗯
Yeah.

202
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,460
这就是你写来做序言的东西
It's the kind of thing you write as a preface.

203
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,630
博得读者眼球
Dazzle them with the basics.

204
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,790
是 挺好的 即便是错的
Yeah, it's great. Even if it's wrong.

205
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,150
错了
It's wrong?

206
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,540
嗯 文明的基石不是语言
Well, the cornerstone of civilization isn't language,

207
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,070
而是科学
it's science.

208

209
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,930
你向我汇报 但当你在壳里时
You'll be reporting to me, but you'll be working with him

210
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,430
你和他一起共事
when you're in the shell.

211
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,590
它们管那个不明飞行物叫壳
That's what they're calling the UFO.

212
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,150
首要目的 它们从何来 何所求
Priority one: what do they want and where are they from?

213
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,710
除此以外 它们是怎么来到这里的
And beyond that, how did they get here?

214
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,360
它们能进行超光速旅行吗
Are they capable of faster-than-light travel?

215
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,950
我准备了一系列的问题要问
I've prepared a list of questions to go over,

216
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,190
以二进制序列的“握手”为开始
starting with a series of "Handshake" Binary sequences...

217
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,830
我们能不能在向它们问数学题之前
How about we just talk to them

218
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,260
先跟它们交流起来
before we start throwing math problems at them?

219
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,670
这就是为什么同时请了你们俩
This is why you're both here.

220
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,270
我来端咖啡
I'll bring the coffee.

221

与外星人一起喝咖啡
Coffee with some aliens.

222

你带他们两个去凯特勒博士那里去
I want you to take these two to Dr. Kettler.

223
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,830
遵命 长官
Yes, sir.

224
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,470
请跟着这位上尉去医务室
Follow the captain to medical.

225
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,270
这只需要几分钟就好
It should take just a few minutes,

226
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,430
然后我们就开始
and then we'll get started.

227
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,790
把背包交给我们 请把手机交给我

手机拿出来
Cell phones!

229
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,790
跟着我
Follow me.

230
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,630
把这些穿上 你们得一直穿着它们
Put these on. You're gonna wear them at all times.

231
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,910
长官 他们到了
Sir, they're here.

232
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,470
露易丝・班克斯 伊恩・唐纳利
Louise Banks? Ian Donnelly?

233
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,450
你们上一顿饭什么时候吃的
When was the last time either of you have eaten?

234
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,790
- 昨晚  - 我也是
- Last night.  - Same.

235
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,730
上一次在压力状态下做事
Last time you did something stressful?

236
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,470
现在算吗
Does now count?

237
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,310
开个玩笑
Just saying...

238
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,150
哦 被抬进救伤直升机的是谁
Uh, who was being carted off in the medevac?

239
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,750
不是所有人都可以经受住这样的经历的
Not everyone is able to process experiences like this.

240
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,750
我需要抽一些你的血
I'm gonna get some blood from you

241
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,390
然后给你打一针疫苗
and give you an immunization dose

242
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,670
能抵御多种细菌威胁
that covers a battery of bacterial threats.

243
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,830
请你在这里签个字 把袖子撸上去
Could you sign these, please? And roll up your sleeves.

244
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,350
你们谁有幽闭恐惧症
Either of you claustrophobic?

245
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,830
- 没有  - 没有
- No.  - No.

246
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,430
目前有没有在用药 对什么过敏
Currently taking any medications? Allergies?

247
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,990
有怀孕吗
Pregnant?

248
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,510
没有
No.

249
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,670
加强剂会对你的身体系统产生冲击
The booster is a kick to your system,

250
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,910
所以你会感觉到一些副作用
so you may experience some side effects,

251
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,590
比如恶心 头晕 头疼
nausea, dizziness, headaches,

252
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,350
耳鸣之类的
a ringing in your ears, like you have tinnitus.

253
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,430
他们不管怎样都不离开
They wouldn't go, either way.

254
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,710
你看到他怎么了吗
You see what's happening to him?

255
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,200
这到底是怎么运行的
How does this even work?

256
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,410
读数没变化
The readings do not change,

257
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,630
但 我不懂
but I don't know,

258
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,950
就好像我们是一片纸上的虫子
it's like we're insects on a piece of paper,

259
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,110
他们在让我们自己撤退
and they're easing us out of the house.

260
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,950
在一百一十二分钟十九秒后
At exactly 112 minutes and 19 seconds,

261
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,310
重力开始起变化 让我们滑出房间
gravity starts to shift and slides us out of the room.

262
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,470
对此你有科学解释吗
Have you found a scientific explanation for it?

263
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,950
比如 这对它们来说有利
Like, is it for them?

264
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,950
哦 不 我觉得是为我们方便的
Uh, no. We think it's for us.

265
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,710
在房间内部的空气似乎并不流通
Air doesn't seem to circulate inside the chamber,

266
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,470
所以两小时后 我们的氧气就消耗光了
so after about two hours, we run out of oxygen.

267
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,150
往那个房间泵送空气用不了十八个小时
It doesn't take 18 hours to pump fresh air into a room.

268
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,710
大气
Atmosphere...

269
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,910
你说什么
Excuse me?

270
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,070
如果它们的大气和地球上的不一样
If their atmosphere is different from Earth,

271
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,550
在它们每次打开舱门之前
it would certainly take hours

272
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,910
它们得将氧气含量及气压进行重新调整
to rebalance their O2 content and pressure for us

273
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,910
已达到我们的适应范围内
every time they open their door.

274
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,380
那么你是说它们能令我们窒息 如果它们想的话
So, they could suffocate us if they wanted.

275
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,310
这位是来自中情局的哈尔彭特工
This is Agent Halpern with the CIA.

276
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,750
我带你们去你们的工位
Let me get you two to your stations.

277
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,060
好的 长官
Yes, sir.

278
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,910
记住 我们得尽快得到答案

417
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,740
好的 我们开始吧
Okay. Let's get started.

418
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,420
[人类]

419
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,230
人类
Human.

420
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,590
人类
"Human."

421
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,880
[人类]

422
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,790
我是人类 你们呢
I'm human. What are you?

423
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,750
人类
Human.

424
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,180
我的天哪
Oh my God!

425
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,460
你记录下来了吗
Are you getting this?

426
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,940
是的 长官 我正把这个传回营地
Yes, sir! It's uploading back to base camp.

427
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,710
露易丝 这太不可思议了
Louise, that's incredible.

428
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,070
人类
Human.

429
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,190
人类
Human.

430
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,590
好的 慢一点
Okay, slow down now.

431
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,910
慢一点
Slow down.

432
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,430
我不想打击你的成功
I don't wanna take away from your success in there,

433
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,980
但是 班克斯博士 这真的是正确的方法吗
but Dr. Banks, is this really the right approach?

434
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,310
尝试教给他们说和读
Trying to teach them how to speak and read?

435
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,190
这要花费更长时间
That's gotta take longer.

436
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,590
你错了 这更快
You're wrong. It's faster.

437
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,250
你在那做的每件事
Everything you do in there,

438
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,590
我都要给一屋子的人解释
I have to explain to a room full of men

439
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,510
他们的问题都是
whose first and last question is...

440
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,630
这将怎样被用来对付我们
"How can this be used against us?"

441
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,430
所以你要给我更多的解释
So you're gonna have to give me more than that.

442
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,470
袋鼠
Kangaroo.

443
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,790
那是什么
What is that?

444
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,390
在一七七零年
In 1770,

445
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,270
詹姆斯・库克船长的船
Captain James Cook's ship ran aground

446
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,630
在澳大利亚海边搁浅
off the coast of Australia,

447
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,470
他带了一队人深入
and he led a party into the country,

448
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,190
遇到了土著人
and they met the Aboriginal people.

449
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,750
一个水手指着
One of the sailors pointed at

450
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,590
跳来跳去
the animals that hop around

451
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,390
将它们的孩子放在育儿袋中的动物
and put their babies in their pouch,

452
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,150
问它们是什么
and he asked what they were,

453
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,350
土著人回答 Kangaroo[袋鼠]
and the Aborigine said, "Kangaroo."

454
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,430
你想说什么
And the point is?

455
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,290
没过多久他们知道了
It wasn't till later that they learned that

456
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,070
Kangaroo的意思是我听不懂 所以
"Kangaroo" Means "I don't understand." So,

457
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,230
我这么做是为了我们不把那里的事情翻译错
I need this so that we don't misinterpret things in there.

458
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,880
否则 将会花费十倍以上的时间
Otherwise, this is gonna take 10 times as long.

459
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,030
现在我接受你的解释
I can sell that for now.

460
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,480
但是在下次进去之前
But I need you to submit your vocabulary words

461
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,910
我需要你上交你的词汇
before the next session.

462
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,510
好的
Fair.

463
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,980
记住土著人所遭受的苦难
And remember what happened to the Aborigines.

464
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,060
一个更加高级的种族几乎将他们赶尽杀绝
A more advanced race nearly wiped them out.

465
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,870
那是个好故事
It's a good story.

466
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,350
谢谢
Thanks.

467
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,950
假的
It's not true.

468
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,150
但它证明了我的观点
But it proves my point.

469
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,840
[人类？]

470
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,280
我认为我们可以复制一些基本数字序列
We think we were able to reproduce

471
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,110
发回给他们
some prime number sequences back at them.

472
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,460
还是小有成就的
So that's something.

473
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,150
那么 祝贺你 你像只鹦鹉
Well, congratulations. You're a parrot.

474
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,850
比那难多了 你个混蛋
It's a lot more than that, you cheeky bastard,

475
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,990
你没看到吗
don't you see?

476
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,070
他们似乎不懂我们的代数
They can't seem to follow our algebra,

477
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,030
但是复杂的行为 他们懂
but complex behaviors, that clicks.

478
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,900
这根本说不通 不是吗
Well that doesn't make any sense at all, does it?

479
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,040
[外星人危机第5天　　在上海中国敦促谨慎集结部队]
问题是 不是每个人都理解我们
Problem is, not everyone shares our policy

480
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,080
[外星人危机第5天　　在上海中国敦促谨慎集结部队]
向外星人的开放态度
of being open with the aliens.

481
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,160
[外星人危机第5天　　在上海中国敦促谨慎集结部队]
你见过尚将军吗
Have you met General Shang?

482
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,350
[外星人危机第5天　　在上海中国敦促谨慎集结部队]
他的命令就像多米诺骨牌
The call sign for him is Big Domino.

483
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,660
不管尚将军干什么
Whatever Shang does,

484
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,510
至少有四个国家会跟随他
at least four other nations will follow.

485
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,750
露易丝 我们今天要上去
Louise? We have to gain ground today.

486
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,270
好的
Okay.

487
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,750
- 你的词汇表呢  - 在这
- You have a vocabulary list for me?  - I do.

488
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,270
你准备教他们你和伊恩的名字
You're gonna teach them your name and Ian's?

489
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,870
是的 这样我们就能知道他们的名字了
Yes, so that we can learn

490
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,590
如果他们有名字的话
their names if they have names,

491
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,510
然后教给他们代词
and then introduce pronouns later.

492
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,190
这些都是小学单词
These are all grade-school words:

493
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,580
吃 走
eat, walk.

494
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,670
解释一下
Help me understand.

495
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,350
好的
Okay. Um...

496
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,550
噢 不不不 别擦上边
Oh, no, no, no! Not the top!

497
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,190
好的 这是你想知道的 对吗
Okay, this is where you wanna get to, right?

498
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,760
- 是的  - 好的
- That is the question.  - Okay.

499
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,030
所以 首先我们需要确保
So, first, we need to make sure that

500
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,230
他们知道什么是问题
they understand what a question is.

501
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:47,100
那么 问题的本质就是
Okay, the nature of a request for information

502
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,750
带有答案的信息
along with a response.

503
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:53,070
接着 我们需要让他们分清
Then, we need to clarify the difference between

504
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,270
个体的你和集体的你
a specific "You" And a collective "You,"

505
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:00,510
因为我们不想知道为什么其中的一个人来了
because we don't wanna know why Joe Alien is here,

506
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,470
我们想知道的是为什么他们全都来了
we want to know why they all landed.

507
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,990
理解“目的”需要引入“意图”这个概念
And purpose requires an understanding of intent.

508
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,350
我们需要搞清楚
We need to find out:

509
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,390
他们能做有意识的决定吗
do they make conscious choices?

510
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,590
或者说他们的动机是本能的
Or is their motivation so instinctive

511
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,710
他们并不能理解什么是问题
that they don't understand a "Why" Question at all?

512
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,310
最重要的是
And... And biggest of all,

513
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,590
我们需要和他们有足够多的词汇
we need to have enough vocabulary with them

514
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,430
以便理解他们的答案
that we understand their answer.

515
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,590
我明白了
I get it.

516
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,030
按照你的词汇表来
Stick to your list.

517
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,590
只是
Just

518
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,390
不要增加任何东西
don't add anything to it.

519
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,910
…是二点九七
...are at 2.97.

520
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,070
氧气含量 百分之二十一点四 完毕
Oxygen level: 21.4%. Over.

521
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,760
秃鹰 阿尔法现在在中厅
Condor, Alpha's now in the nave.

522
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,670
设置好装备和遥感系统 完毕
Setting up equipment and telemetry. Over.

523
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,270
我们开始吧
Let's get started.

524
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,960
[露易斯]

525
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,270
露易丝 露易丝 我是露易丝
Louise. Louise. I am Louise.

526
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,750
那是什么
What is that?

527
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,430
那是一个新符号吗 我看不懂
Is that a new symbol? I can't tell.

528
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,230
我不知道 我认为那还是人类的意思
I don't know. I think it's the symbol for human again.

529
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,620
他只是在尾部加了一点弯曲
It just has a little curl on the end,

530
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,630
可能是问句的意思
maybe to indicate a question.

531
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,430
我不知道
I don't know.

532
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,700
我不知道 露易丝
I don't know, Louise.

533
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,100
我认为他们很疑惑
I think they're getting confused.

534
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,670
班克斯博士
Dr. Banks,

535
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,950
你可以进行下一个单词了
perhaps we should move on to the next word.

536
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,790
班克斯博士
Dr. Banks!

537
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,280
我没事
It's okay.

538
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,440
发生了什么
What's going on?

539
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,870
嘿 你在干嘛呢
Hey! What are you doing?

540
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,220
没事 我很好
Yeah, I'm fine.

541
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,950
你疯了吗
Are you insane?

542
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,710
他们需要看清我
They need to see me.

543
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,630
她把防护服脱了
She's taking off her hazmat suit.

544
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,400
这可以吗
Is it okay?

545
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,610
你有被感染的危险
You're risking contamination.

546
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,070
他们需要看请我
They need to see me.

547
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,630
班克斯博士
Dr. Banks...

548
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,870
班克斯博士
Dr. Banks.

549
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,260
她向屏幕走去了
She's walking towards the screen.

550
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,710
我们要中止任务吗
Should we abort?

551
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,230
请求收到 等待后续命令
Recourse noted. Stand by for further orders.

552
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,950
回到自己的位置上去
Go back to your stations.

553
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,910
这才是合适的自我介绍 嘿
Now that's a proper introduction. Hey.

554
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,030
露易丝
Louise.

555
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,150
我是露易丝
I am Louise.

556
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,470
伊恩 你想介绍下你自己吗
Ian, do you want to introduce yourself?

557
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,430
好
Uh, yeah.

558
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,430
露易丝

管它呢
Screw it!

560
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,630
每个人都会死 对吗
Everybody dies, right?

561
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,830
长官 唐纳利脱掉了防护服
Sir, Donnelly is taking off his hazmat suit.

00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,350
你们呢
Who are you?

568
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,350
我认为这是他们的名字
I think those are their names.

569
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,750
它们有名字
They have names.

570
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,140
所以 我们要叫他们什么呢
So, what are we gonna call them?

571
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,830
我不知道
I don't know.

572
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,350
[1940至50年代美国好莱坞著名喜剧搭档]
艾伯特和科斯特洛怎么样
I was thinking Abbott and Costello.

573
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,750
可以
Yeah.

574
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,590
- 可以吗  - 是的 我喜欢
- Yeah?  - Yeah, I like it.

575
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,910
我喜欢
I like it.

576
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,630
哇哦
Wow!

577
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,260
一队 下车
Team 1, exit your vehicle

578
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:21,030
直接去消毒营
and proceed directly ahead to the decontamination tent.

579
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,710
开着呼吸器直到进入仪器室
Leave your respirator on until you reach the equipment room.

580
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,590
我知道 嘘
I know. Shhh!

581
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,070
二队 下车
Team 2, exit your vehicles

582
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,630
去消毒营
and continue to the decontamination tent.

583
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,270
开着呼吸机
Leave your respirators on

584
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,950
在到达仪器室之前
and do not hesitate

585
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,870
不要停下
until you have reached the equipment room.

586
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,470
感觉怎么样
How do you feel?

587
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,310
精疲力竭
Overworked.

588
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,390
我猜不需要我告诉你
Well, I guess I don't need to tell you

589
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,950
你把自己置于危险之中
you're putting yourself at risk.

590
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,510
还没有发现有毒放射物
There's no signs of radiation poisoning yet.

591
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,310
看看你的血液检测情况
We'll see how your blood tests look.

592
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,960
现在 我要给你另一种药
For now, I'm gonna give you another boost.

593
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,430
好的
Okay.

594
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,310
没有放射物
No radiation.

595
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,070
也没有检测到其他物质
Nothing else we can detect either,

596
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,540
但我还是要给他们打一针混合疫苗
but I'd give them a strong cocktail, regardless.

597
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,430
这是我们第一次取得这么大的进步
It's the first time we've made significant progress.

598
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,990
好吧 这风险我们担了
All right. We'll take the risk.

599
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,430
好了 亲爱的
Okay, honey...

600
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,890
那里发生了什么
What is going on there?

601
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,060
亲爱的
Honey...

602
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,350
告诉我
Just tell me!

603
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,350
你不需要担心 好吗
You don't need to worry, okay?

604
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,110
- 我怎么能不担心  - 冷静点
- How can I not worry?  - Just calm down.

605
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,710
冷静下来
Just calm down.

606

贝基问我怪兽会不会把爸爸杀了
Becky asked me if the monsters are going to kill Daddy!

607

亲爱的 这不会发生的
Honey, it's not gonna happen.

你要好好的
Just stay safe.

609

你不需要担心
You don't need to worry.

610
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,750
求你了 我好害怕
Please! I'm so scared!

全体宵禁 除非得到指挥官特别授权
general curfew unless expressly authorized

Effective immediately, midnight rations will be served all night.

618
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,590
我们对于七脚怪
Here are some of the many things

619
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,710
还是一无所知
we don't know about heptapods.

620
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,110
希腊语中 Hepta指的是七 Pod指的是脚
Greek. Hepta, "Seven. " Pod, "Foot."

621
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,800
七只脚 七脚怪
Seven feet. Heptapod.

622
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,830
他们到底是什么
Who are they?

623
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,750
试图更加深入的了解他们
Trying to answer this in any meaningful way

624
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,590
而现实总是让人失望
is hampered by the fact that,

625
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,590
在外面 能看见他们的样子 听见他们的声音
outside being able to see them and hear them,

626
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,750
但七脚怪完全没有留下任何踪迹
the heptapods leave absolutely no footprint.

627
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,020
对其飞船的化学分析也没有任何结果
The chemical composition of their spaceship is unknown.

628
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,350
壳体不会产出废料 不会排出气体 也没有辐射
The shell emits no waste, no gas, no radiation.

629
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,670
假设这些壳体之间能够交流
Assuming that the shells communicate with each other,

630
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,350
却不被人类所发现
they do so without detection.

631
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,950
壳体之间的空气不会
The air between the shells is untroubled

632
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,990
受到声波和光波的影响
by sonic emission or light wave.

633
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,030
那他们是科学家吗 还是游客
Are they scientists? Or tourists?

634
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,510
假设他们科学家
If they're scientists,

635
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,900
但并没有询问一大堆的问题
they don't seem to ask a lot of questions.

636
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,260
为什么他们停在了这儿
Why did they park where they did?

637
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,870
世界上最有学识的专家也无法解释
The world's most decorated experts can't crack that one.

638
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,550
最有可能的原因是
The most plausible theory is

639
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,110
他们选择停在地球上
that they chose places on Earth

640
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,700
几乎不会有闪电的地方
with the lowest incidence of lightning strikes.

641
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,790
但是也有例外
But there are exceptions.

642
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,870
另一个可能理论是
The next most plausible theory is that

00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,550
在一九八年 希娜・伊斯顿的歌曲
Sheena Easton had a hit song

644
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,150
在这些地方红极一时
at each of these sites in 1980.

645
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,870
因此我们还是一无所知
So, we just don't know.

646
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,860
他们是怎样交流的
How do they communicate?

647
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,070
露易丝在这儿使我们自惭形秽
Here, Louise is putting us all to shame.

648
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,830
取得的第一个突破是
The first breakthrough was

649
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,480
发现了七脚怪所说的话
to discover that there's no correlation

650
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,300
和所写的字之间没有任何关联
between what a heptapod says and what a heptapod writes.

651
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,660
[伊恩行走]

652
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,590
和所有人类文字不同的是
Unlike all written human languages,

653
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,190
他们使用的是意符文字
their writing is semasiographic.

654
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,750
文字代表了意思 但不代表发音
It conveys meaning. It doesn't represent sound.

655
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,390
可能他们觉得我们的文字
Perhaps they view our form of writing

656
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,000
完全是多此一举

对七脚怪文字的研究
for their study of how heptapods write,

678
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,550
因为不像说话 意音文字不会随着时间改变其意思
because unlike speech, a logogram is free of time.

679
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,470
就像他们的飞船和身体一样
Like their ship or their bodies,

680
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,910
他们的文字不存在
their written language has no forward

681
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,350
具体的顺序
or backward direction.

682
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,310
语言学家称其为非线性拼写法
Linguists call this non-linear orthography,

683
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,790
这不由的让人怀疑 他们也是这么思考的吗
which raises the question, "Is this how they think?"

684
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,750
想象一下你要用双手写一个句子
Imagine you wanted to write a sentence using two hands,

685
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,390
分别从两边开始书写
starting from either side.

686
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,630
你必须清楚你想要用的每个词语
You would have to know each word you wanted to use,

687
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,510
和它们所占据的空间的大小
as well as how much space they would occupy.

688
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,790
七脚怪能毫不费力
A heptapod can write a complex sentence

689
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,990
在两秒中内写一个复杂的句子
in two seconds, effortlessly.

690

01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,430
只有科斯特洛了吗
Do we only have Costello?

844
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,820
很好 你来了
Okay. There you are.

845
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,790
它说了什么
What does it say?

846
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,070
提供武器
Offer weapon.

847
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,150
你看见他们写的了
You saw what they wrote!

848
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,570
他们还没搞懂那个词的意思
Using a word they don't fully understand.

849
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,190
- 可能只是个要求  - 是警告
- Could be a request.  - A warning.

850
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:07,190
够了 露易丝你说
Enough! Louise?

851
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,310
我们不知道他们是否理解了
We don't know if they understand

852
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,030
武器和工具之间的区别
the difference between a weapon and a tool.

853
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,990
我们的语言和文化一样复杂
Our language, like our culture, is messy,

854
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,870
有时候 一个词可能包含很多意思
and sometimes, one can be both.

855
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,310
这是很有可能的
And it's quite possible

856
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,670
他们想要我们提供一些东西
that they're asking us to offer them something,

857
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,150
而不是提供给我们武器
not the other way around.

858
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,350
就好像第一次交易
It's like the first part of a trade.

859
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,310
所以 我们怎样搞明白
So, how do we clarify their intentions

860
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,750
他们究竟是什么意思
beyond those two words?

861
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:27,840
我会再进去一次
Well, I go back in.

862
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,830
就现在 我们进去搞清楚
Right away, we go back in and we clear this up.

863
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,550
听起来很复杂啊
It's more complicated than that.

864
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:34,020
这怎么就很复杂了
How is it more complicated than that?

865
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,500
上校 国防部长
Colonel, the Secretary of Defense

866
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,150
要求和你通话
is on the line for you.

867
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,790
在我们弄清楚它的意思之前
We need to sit on this information

868
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,310
这个消息需要保密
till we know what it means,

869
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,270
所以不要告诉我们的敌人
so we aren't sharing it with our enemies.

870
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:51,750
还有一种情况是
We must consider the idea

871
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,930
我们的观光者想要我们自相残杀
that our visitors are prodding us to fight among ourselves

872
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:56,390
直到一方取得胜利
until only one faction prevails.

873
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,390
- 没有那样的事  - 就是这样
- There's no evidence of that.  - Sure there is.

874
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,860
多看看历史书吧
Just grab a history book.

875
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,590
英国人和印度人 德国人和卢旺达人
The British with India, the Germans with Rwanda.

876
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,110
他们甚至在匈牙利命名了
They even got a name for it in Hungary.

877
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:16,590
不只是一个人掌控着这个世界
Yeah. We're a world with no single leader.

878
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,370
他们不可能只和一个国家做交易
It's impossible to deal with just one of us.

879
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,750
而武器这个词
And with the word "Weapon" Now...

880
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:24,510
- 哈尔彭  - 到 长官
- Halpern.  - Yes, sir!

881
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:45,790
暂时没有消息 待命
No confirmation yet. Standing by.

882
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:49,830
有消息了吗 他们说了什么
Anything? What did they say?

883
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,490
中国和俄罗斯都不在线
China and Russia are off the grid.

884
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:53,790
他们没和任何人说话
They aren't speaking to anyone.

885
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:57,500
他们在上次交谈中了解到的内容把他们吓坏了
Whatever they learned in their last session has them spooked.

886
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,590
好的 长官
Yes, sir!

887
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,470
上级要求我们离线
We have orders to do the same.

888
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:03,700
这些是我们的盟友
These are our allies!

889
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:04,950
你不能这样
You can't shut us down!

890
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,710
- 关闭我们的信号  - 快点
- Put us on radio silence.  - Do it.

891
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:10,380
我们收到了来自七脚怪的消息 天啊
We received a message from the hept... Damn it!

892
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,950
我们应该保持沟通
We need to be talking to each other!

893
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,750
你想和他们说话 弄清楚这什么意思
You want to talk to them? Find out what this means.

894
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:22,950
基地连线已关闭
Base-camp talk is now offline.

895
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,350
所有的传译员和国际联系人
All interpreters and international liaisons,

896
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:29,030
暂时离开 去向协调人报告
stand down and report to unit coordinators.

897
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,550
我们之前从没有再次对话
We've never re-entered a session before.

898
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:36,230
露易丝 相信我 我们还有时间
Louise, trust me, okay? We've got time.

899
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,510
我们快成功了对吧
We've just gotta step on it, all right?

900
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,550
使用武器
"Use weapon."

901
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,080
[“使用武器”]
来自外星人的信息
This is the alien message

902
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,440
[“使用武器”]
导致中国政府今天
said to have provoked the Chinese government

903
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,240
[“使用武器”]
让科学家们退出了
to withdraw their scientists from

904
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,750
[“使用武器”]
国际合作任务
the international mission today.

905
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,070
尚将军在声明中说到
In a statement, General Shang said,

906
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,400
[“中国不再信任想要制造分裂的外星人，人类必须受到保护”]
[中国人民解放军主席 商将军]
中国不再相信外星人了
"China no longer trusts the aliens

907
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:53,800
[“中国不再信任想要制造分裂的外星人，人类必须受到保护”]
[中国人民解放军主席 商将军]
他们想要分裂我们
"Who want to divide us.

908
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:56,470
[“中国不再信任想要制造分裂的外星人，人类必须受到保护”]
[中国人民解放军主席 商将军]
人类必须相互保护
"Humanity must be protected."

909
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,270
中国请求立即和联合国进行对话
China has asked for immediate talks at the UN.

910
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,070
阿尔法一九
Alpha-one-niner,

911
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,670
我是秃鹰 完毕
this is Condor, over.

912
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:13,790
阿尔法一九 我是秃鹰 请说话 完毕
Alpha-one-niner, this is Condor, come in. Over.

913
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,310
马克思上校 秃鹰未收到回复
Captain Marks, Condor not receiving transmission.

914
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,590
收到请回复
Squelch twice if you hear line.

915
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,350
马克思上校 护送人员被命令
Captain Marks, all escort units

916
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,270
立即停止所有行动
are ordered to cease all activity.

917
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:01,140
不 不 不 班克斯博士 你不能进去
No, no, no. Dr. Banks, you can't go in there.

918
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,150
我只想问一个问题
I just need to ask one question.

919
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:05,270
班克斯博士 对话已经结束
Dr. Banks! The session is finished.

920
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,590
你不能 你不能再进去了 里面非常危险
You can't... You can't go back in. It's dangerous.

921
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,570
听着 我们只需要五分钟 不要这么紧张
Look, we just need five minutes. Don't sweat it.

922
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,350
马克思 让他们进去
Marks, let them go.

923
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,030
嘿 艾伯特
Hey, Abbott!

924
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:24,110
所以 现在是什么 第三十七次对话
So, what are we calling this? Session 37?

925
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,660
不 是三十六次 第二部分
Uh, no, 36, part 2.

926
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,630
为什么只有他们俩在里面
Why are they on their own?

927
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,020
我们一直试图联系马克思上校
We've been attempting to hail Captain Marks.

928
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,870
护送小组并未回复 长官
The escort units are not responding, sir.

929
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:43,030
为什么 安排保护人员
Why not? Send security.

930
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,100
提供武器 到底是什么意思
"Offer weapon, question mark."

931
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,620
你会给我们什么吗
Are you offering us something?

932
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:09,230
科技 设备 还是方法
Technology, apparatus, method?

933
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,470
看 这是一个不同的词
Yeah, see, this is a different word.

934
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:14,310
这 这个部分 图案更复杂
This... This segment, it's a lot busier.

935
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:23,190
提供科技
Give technology

936
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,190
现在
now.

937
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,670
他在做什么
What's he doing?

938
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,590
上尉 十点钟方向
Captain, on your ten.

939
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,710
安保分队已到 长官
Security detail inbound, sir.

940
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,430
倒计时还剩四分钟 我们要坚持到底
T-minus 4 minutes remaining. We need to see this through.

941
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,550
好了 没问题 重新装弹
Okay, this is it. Lock and load.

942
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,870
我们只需要在结束前拖延住他们
We just need to hold them off until it's done.

943
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,470
收到 只进行示警射击和镇压火力
Copy that. Warning shots and suppressive fire only.

944
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,890
全副武装 准备掩护
Load up and get to cover.

945
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,070
保持冷静 我们可以避免人员伤亡
Stay frosty and we can avoid casualties.

946
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,140
艾伯特想让我写在玻璃上
Abbott wants me to write on the barrier.

947
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,950
可以这么做吗
Can you even do that?

948
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,950
不知道
I don't know.

949
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,670
我没法同时用两只手写出来
I can't do it with both hands.

950
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,830
露易丝
Louise...

951
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,340
怎么回事
What is that?

952
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,470
嘿 轻点
Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.

953
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:25,310
你刚刚脑震荡了 躺回去吧
You suffered a concussion. Just lay back.

954
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,390
感觉怎么样
How do you feel?

955
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:39,990
伊恩怎么样
How is Ian?

956
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,270
跟你一样 他没事
Same as you. He's okay.

957
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:46,350
谁 呃 谁干的
Who, um... Who did this?

958
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,190
啊 几个士兵
Ah, some soldiers.

959
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,510
他们电视看多了
They've been watching too much TV.

960
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,110
什么声音
What is that?

961
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,590
别紧张 放轻松
Take it easy. Take it easy.

962
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:01,270
这里不再安全了 我们在准备撤离
The site's no longer secure. We're standing by to evacuate.

963
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,270
伊恩在哪
Where's Ian?

964
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:06,270
大概十分钟前 韦伯把他叫走了
Weber came and got him maybe 10 minutes ago.

965
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:09,110
直到知道你没事他才离开
He wouldn't leave until he knew you were okay.

966
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,870
你们整个营里的工作人员
Your whole tent is on the clock

967
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,710
都在研究你们刚刚的发现
to figure out whatever it is you were given up there.

968
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,950
这是全部吗
This is all of it?

969
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,550
录像没有被爆炸影响吗
The feed wasn't interrupted by the explosion?

970
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,030
据我所知没有
Not as far as I can see.

971
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,870
你看到了什么
You see something?

972
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,470
哦 还未可知
Oh, I don't know yet.

973
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,390
我需要和露易丝的团队一起研究
I'm gonna need my team to get together with Louise's team.

974
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,070
我需要所有工作人员一起研究
I need everybody working on this.

975
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,550
我们不能离开
We cannot leave.

976
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:42,070
很高兴你醒了
Glad to see you're awake.

977
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,910
我们需要回到里面 解释我们不是有意这么做的
We need to go back in and explain this wasn't our fault.

978
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,990
- 我们不能再进去了  - 我们必须进去
- We can't go back inside.  - We have to.

979
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:49,380

982
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,510
我们可能不得不撤离
We may have to evacuate.

不 这才是错误的举动
No, that's the wrong move.

只要他们不走 我们就必须留下
As long as they stay, we have to stay.

985
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,110
他们不是要走

Yeah. Come here.

看这部分
Take a look at this section.

1038

他好像在说时间
It seems to be talking about time.

1039
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,480
他们的时间符号随处可见
Their symbol for time is everywhere.

1040
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,070
所以这是什么
So what is this?

1041
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,670
一个超光速飞行公式
A formula for faster-than-light travel?

1042
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:02,830
谁说得准
Who can tell?

1043
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,470
他们有很多的缺口
There are too many gaps.

1044
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,070
没一个完整的
Nothing's complete.

1045
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,670
然后我才恍然大悟
Then it dawned on me.

1046
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,230
过来这边
Come here.

1047

这里
Right here.

1048
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:15,950
不要只关注存在什么 还要看看空缺的部分
Stop focusing on the ones. Look at the zeroes.

1049
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:17,950
实物数据占多少
How much of this is data?

1050
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,670
空缺部分占多少
How much of it is negative space?

1051
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:22,630
所以 我测算了一下
So, I measured it.

1052

零点零八三三 三循环
0.0833 recurring.

1053

十二分之一
One of twelve.

1055
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:46,230
他们想在这里说的是这是十二个中的一个
What they're saying right here is that this is one of 12.

1056
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,150
“我们是一个大整体中的一部分”
"We are part of a larger whole."

1057
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:50,430
或者我们是十二个奖品角逐者其中之一
Or we're one of 12 contestants for the prize.

1058
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,870
我为什么要跟他说话
Why do I have to talk to him?

1059
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,390
我们都在一起工作
We're all working together.

1060
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,750
我们需要和其他地点交流
We need to talk to the other sites,

1061
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:58,350
用他们从七脚怪那里得到的信息帮助他们
help them with what they've gotten from the heptapods.

1062
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,630
我们的通讯被中断了
We're blacked out.

1063
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,910
中国已经扬言要毁掉他们的外星飞船
China just threatened to destroy their shell.

1064
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,060
我们只能靠自己
We're on our own.

1065
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:04,970
但是这也说了所有的部分可以拼凑在一起
But this says that all of the pieces fit together.

1066
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,830
我要告诉你没人关心这些
And I'm telling you that no one else cares.

1067
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,470

In their final session, the aliens said,

1071
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:21,670
“时间紧迫 合众为一”
"There is no time. Many become one."

1072
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,270
我担心所有人都开始明火执仗
I fear we have all been given weapons.

1073
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:28,030
如果有人收到这条信息 请
If anyone is receiving this, please...

1074
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,590
嗯 我的意思是
Well, I mean,

1075
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,110
有很多种方式
there are a lot of ways

1076
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:39,590
可以解释他说的话
you can interpret what he said.

1077
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,720
我不需要一个翻译告诉我这是什么意思
I don't need an interpreter to know what this means.

1078
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:43,870
俄罗斯刚刚处决了其中的一个专家
Russia just executed one of their own experts

1079
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:45,150
以防走漏风声
to keep their secret.

1080
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:47,750
“合众为一”的意思可能是
"Many become one" Could just be their way of saying

1081
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,550
需要各国通力合作
"Some assembly required."

1082
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,390
那为什么只给我们每个国家一部分
Why hand it out to us in pieces?

1083
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,190
为什么不直接给我们完整的
Why not just give it all over?

1084

还有什么更好的方式能让我们合作一次
What better way to force us to work together for once?

Even if I did believe you,

how in the world are you gonna get anybody else to play along

1087

贡献出他们的资料
and give up their data?

1088
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,070
我们也提供我们的资料
We offer ours in return.

1089

Yeah?

A trade?

1091

Only way to reach them is to physically drive there

and yell at the border guards, which we're doing,

但是这样太慢了
but it won't be fast enough.

1100
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,820
一定有其他方法和他们联络
There must be a way to get the message to them.

1101
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,830
我们的盟国有希望 但是这样机会渺茫而且是亡羊补牢
To our allies, maybe, but it's too little too late.

1102
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:43,430
我们现在要做的就是在一国触发全球战争之前
What we need is to get all the other nations online

1103
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,430
联系到所有可以通讯的国家
before one starts global war.

1104
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,470
但是我们现在无法联系到他们
And there's no way for us to reach them.

1105
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,590
好 等一下 有了
Okay, hold on a second. There is!

1106
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,150
它现在处于我们的正上方
It's right above us.

1107
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:55,640
对我们来说它才是当务之急
That's problematic for us right now.

1108
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,750
国防部认为这个飞船会报复我们
The Pentagon's convinced our shell will retaliate.

1109
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:01,950
我猜他们会命令我们一个小时内撤离
My guess is they'll order us to evacuate within the hour.

1110
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:03,790
听着 他们不是我们的敌人
Look, they're not our enemy.

1111
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:05,990
他们并没有对我们做出攻击性行为
They've made no act of aggression towards us.

1112
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:08,200
也许这就是他们进攻的方式
Maybe this is their way of being aggressive.

1113
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:09,710
这不是问题
That's not the question.

1114
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,390
那什么才是问题
What is the question?

1115
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,710
现在它已经半英里高
How do we get you back in that room

1116
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,430
我们怎么把你们送上去都成问题
when it's half a mile straight up?

1117
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,270
