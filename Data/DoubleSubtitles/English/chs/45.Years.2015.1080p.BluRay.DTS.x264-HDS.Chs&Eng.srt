大清早孩子就吵醒我了
I've got the twins waking me up at the crack of dawn.

10
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,690
老天啊 我完全忘了
Oh, my God, I completely forgot.

12
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,190

- How are you both coping?  - It's a hell of a lot of work, that's to be sure.

13
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,570
我同意
I don't doubt it a second.

14
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,110
你会没事的 你年轻力壮
But you'll be fine. You were always a capable young man.

15
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,490

You must be getting excited.

16

- Saturday, isn't it?  - Don't remind me. So much work to do.

17
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,490
小事一桩
Yeah, it'll be fine.

And I'm really over the moon for both of you.

- 谢谢 默瑟女士  - 别见外 叫我凯特就行
- Thank you, Mrs Mercer.  - Kate. Call me Kate.

21
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,790
这可不是学校 不用那么礼貌
We're not at school any more.

22
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,670
我会的
Will do.

23
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,710
[The Platters 为美国黑人摇滚乐队]
[代表作《Only You》、《Smoke Gets in Your Eyes》]
你觉得Platters的歌怎么样
What do you think of that Platters song?

24
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,000
- 什么  - The Platters的歌
- The what?  - The Platters song.

25
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,450
干嘛用的
What for?

26
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,290
第一支舞啊
First dance.

27
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,300
不觉得用婚礼上的那首歌有点过时了吗
Or think it's a bit naff to have the same song we had at our wedding?

28
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,920
不觉得 那歌很好听
No. Lovely song.

29
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,800
- 我很喜欢  - 我知道
- I've always liked it.  - Yeah, I know.

30
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,520
♫ 人们曾经问我怎知 ♫
♪ Asked me how I knew ♪

31
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,150
♫ 我的爱情意真挚 ♫
♪ My true love was true ♪

32
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,290
这什么  - 一封信
- What is it?  - A letter.

33
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,420
我看得出来 谁写的
Yes, I know, but who from?

34
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,090
- 德语写的  - 是啊
- It's in German.  - Yeah.

35
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,260
说了点啥
What's it say?

36
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:26,350
好多词我都不记得了 但…
Well, I can't remember the verbs as well as the nouns, but...

37
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,190
我觉得是他们找到她了
But I think it says they've found her.

38
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,190
找到谁了
Found who?

39
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,690
她的尸体
Well, her body, anyway.

40
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,860
别吓我 杰夫 谁啊
God. who? Geoff.

41
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,990
他们找到卡蒂亚了
T-They've found Katya.

42
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,790
你知道我在说谁吧
Y-You know who I'm talking about, don't you?

43
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,040
当然
Of course.

44
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,210
我清楚记得跟你说过她的事
Cos, I-I remember telling you, clear as day.

45
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,840
我当然记得 都这么久了
Of course I remember. I mean, it was a long time ago.

46
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,130
是啊 我就知道跟你说过我的卡蒂亚
Yeah, I-I know I told you about my Katya.

47
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:05,220
她在那呆了五十多年 和放进冷藏室一样
She's been there over 50 years, like something in the freezer.

48
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,690
现在他们找到她了
Now they've found her.

49
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:15,490
[图伦人是欧洲发现的史前人类]
像在瑞典沼泽里发现图伦人一样
L-Like that, er, Tollund Man in the Swedish bog.

50
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,070
其实是在丹麦发现的
Well, Danish, actually.

51
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,020
- 啊  - 教程上有说
- Hm?  - It was on the curriculum for years.

52
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,230
我给三年级的学生讲过
I taught it to the third-formers.

53
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,670
我给你再倒点茶
I'll make some more tea.

54
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,550
我得要本字典
Yeah, I'm going to need a dictionary.

55
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,190
我不记得放哪儿了
I-I don't know where to look.

56
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,520
看看那些塑料盒里有没有
Why don't you check in the plastic boxes?

57
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,570
没有 除了些DIY的书
Nothing. Nothing but do-it-yourself books.

58
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,420
就是这本
That's it.

59
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,560
谢谢
Ah, thank you.

60
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,900
雪完全融化了
You see, what's happened is the snow has completely melted.

61
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,320
剩下的都是冰
All that's left is the ice.

62
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,810
他们就是这样找到她的
A-And that's how they found her.

63
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,400
- 你什么意思  - 她还在那里
- What do you mean?  - Well, she's still there.

64
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,480
- 在冰里面  - 没错
- In the ice?  - Yeah.

65
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,620
可能在下游 但水很清澈
Way down, I'm sure, but the water is very pure up there.

66
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,570
肯定是这样 他们就发现了她
It must be, so they can see her.

67
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,580
- 他们把她弄出来了吗  - 还没
- Well, haven't they taken her out?  - Not yet.

68
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,830
为什么
Why not?

69
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,540
凯特 她可是在瑞士的冰川里
Well, she's in a glacier in the Swiss mountains, Kate.

70
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,250
没那么容易
It can't be that easy.

71
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,430
没有上去的路
There are no roads up there.

72
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,800
那他们怎么确定是她的呢
So, how do they know it's her?

73
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,430
我觉得 不一定是她
I mean, it might not be her at all.

74
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,760
从发现她的位置来看 也就是个猜想吧
Well, they've made an assumption, I suppose, from where they found her.

75
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,190
他们可能是通过衣物辨别出来的
Maybe they can tell from what she's wearing.

76
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,890
从衣物
From what she's wearing?

77
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:21,820
对 对 那些冰岛的飞行员 我记得
Oh, yeah, yeah, th-those, er, airmen in...lceland, I-I think it was,

78
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,770
他们的衣服就保存完好
they were perfectly preserved,

79
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,360
我不记得了
Oh, I don't remember that.

80
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,190
是的 我看过关于这个的纪录片
Yes. I saw a documentary on it.

81
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,620
由于快速冷冻的原因 衣物还保持死亡前的样子
They were the same as when they died because of how quickly they froze.

82
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,950
你觉得是这么回事
And you think that's what's happened?

83
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,750
我不知道 但我能想
Well, I don't know, but you can imagine.

84
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,880
我可不这么想 都过去那么久了
Not sure it works like that. Not after all this time.

85
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,510
那得多奇怪啊
How strange would that be, though?

86
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,640
她的模样一点没变
She'll look like she did in 1962.

87
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,390
而我却是这般模样
And I look like this.

88
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,740
怎么了
What is it?

89
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,910
凯特 别生气
Er, don't be cross, Kate.

90
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,450
我去抽支烟
I'm going to have a smoke.

91
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,990
- 你还好吧  - 我没事
- Are you all right?  - Fine.

92
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,530
把药和这个都吃了
Please eat this. And take your pills.

93
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,780
他们问我要不要去趟瑞士
Th-They've asked if I want to go to Switzerland.

94
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,000
何出此言
Why would they ask that?

95
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,170
去看尸体
Well, to see the body.

96
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,790
- 什么时候  - 很快吧
- When?  - Soon, I suppose.

97
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,720
- 你不会是想去吧  - 我不知道
- You aren't thinking of going?  - Don't know.

98
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,840
这可是去瑞士啊
All the way to Switzerland?

99
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,260
也不是很远
It's not that far.

100
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,010
有伦敦去瑞士的航班
There are fights from Stansted.

101
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,510
没错 但也很远了
Yeah, but it's far enough,

102
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,470
- 你觉得我不应该去  - 说真心话
- You don't think I should?  - Honestly?

103
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,480
是的
Well, no.

104
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,520
我不知道你去了干嘛
I don't see the point.

105
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,770
- 我们周六还有派对呢  - 我也不是现在去
- Plus we've got the party on Saturday.  - I wasn't thinking of going now.

106
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,200
- 我现在不走  - 但还是
- I-I wouldn't go now.  - Yeah, but still.

107
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,320
我可不敢想你去爬什么山
I don't like the idea of you climbing a big bloody mountain.

108
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,650
应该不会去爬山的
Well, I don't think it would come to that.

109
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,990
你连和我在河边散步都不去
You don't like going for a walk with me on the Broads

110
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,120
- 那里那么平坦  - 我知道
- and that's as flat as a pancake.  - I know.

111
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,750
凯特 我说了 我不会去爬山的
Like I said, Kate, it wouldn't come to that.

112
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,920
但是…
But still...

113
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,510
- 你不是要去镇上吗  - 我可以再安排
- Don't you have to go into town?  - Oh, I can rearrange.

114
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,710
别 你快去吧
No. Y-you should go.

115
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,640
我就是有点受惊
It's been a bit of a shock, that's all.

116
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,810
我没事的
But I'm fine.

117
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,020
- 你确定  - 我确定
- Are you sure?  - Yeah, positive.

118
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,770
空空的 看起来确实不同
Oh, It looks different, all empty.

119
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,310
这里通常是放桌子的
Well, this is where the tables are usually placed.

120
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,110
贵宾席在这 大伙都看得见这
The top one over there, so that everyone can see you.

121
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,600
我们不需要贵宾席 但还是谢谢
We won't be having a top table, but thank you.

122
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,810
真的
Really?

123
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,400
这种场合应该有贵宾席
A top table is so lovely at an event like this.

124
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,780
你们可是屋里的焦点
The two of you as a focal point of the room.

125
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,860
我们不是想重现婚礼现场
We're not trying to recreate the wedding.

126
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,660
就是个聚会
It's just a party.

127
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,950
那是自然 尊重您的选择
Yes, well, it's your choice, of course.

128
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:06,170
我还是得说 在这里庆祝纪念日是明智之选
I will say, though, it's a wonderful place, location-wise, for an anniversary.

129
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,120
四十周年了吧
It's your 40th, isn't it?

130
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,420
四十五周年
45th.

131
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,590
四十五周年庆倒是很特别
That's an unusual one to celebrate.

132
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,670
四十周年的时候我丈夫病了 我们就重新安排了
My husband was ill and our 40th was cancelled, so we had to rearrange.

133
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:22,470
那我就得把聚会做的更加特别
Well, I must try and make this one super-special, then, mustn't I?

134
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,890
来这办纪念活动再合适不过了

一个小小的木头戒指 橡木做的 和幕环一样
It was a small wooden ring, like a curtain ring, made of oak.

If I hadn't, well, it's hardly, er...

我真的没事
Yeah. really, I am.

233

I can hardly be cross with something that happened before we existed, can I?

00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,170
但是…
Still...

可以抱一下吗
I suppose a cuddle's out of the question.

都不觉得在场的人是我
It doesn't even feel like it was me that was there.

How long had you been up there?

We had a map, er, to start with.

I've still got it somewhere.

我们到了大山高地
Yeah, we were getting higher into the mountains

245

我觉得我们最好还是找个人

00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,320
真烦心
And, Christ, did it annoy me?

269
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,570
可然后 传来一声尖叫
But then, there was a scream.

270
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,910
不是很大声
It wasn't a loud scream, neither.

271
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,210
我感觉是 受到惊吓 从肺里喷出来的空气
Sort of outpouring of air from her lungs, from the shock, I suppose.

272
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,460
粗哑低沉
It was low and guttural.

273
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:01,050
不像她原本的嗓音
Not like her voice, which was soft, higher-pitched.

274
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,850
天 太恐怖了
God, that's just horrible.

275
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,180
然后呢
And then what?

276
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,140
然后就没了
That was it, really.

277
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,270
我到的时候 她已经不见了
When I got there, she'd gone.

278
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,150
指路的看着那窟窿
And Kerouac was looking down this hole.

279
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,400
一个裂缝
A fissure.

280
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,950
没错 应该这么叫 岩石上一条小小的缝
Yeah, a fissure, I suppose you'd call it, like a narrow, narrow crack in the rock.

281
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,320
你记得苏格兰的那条吗
D-Do you remember that one in Scotland?

282
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,790
- 我记得  - 和那个一样
- Yeah, I do.  - Yeah. Well, it was like that one.

283
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,710
- 懂了  - 就是更深点
- Yeah.  - Only much deeper.

284
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,260
指路的就站在那里
And Kerouac was just standing there.

285
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:47,550
他的脸都变黄了
His face, oddly enough,it looked almost yellow.

286
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,980
她金黄色的
Was she blonde?

287
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,100
- 什么  - 她是金黄色的头发
- Sorry?- Did she have blond hair?

288
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,900
不是 她头发深色
Oh, no. no. She had dark hair.

289
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,230
和我的一样咯
Like mine, then.

290
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,400
不是像现在这样
I mean, not now.

291
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,030
对 和你的一样
Yeah, like yours.

292
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,240
她多大当时
How old was she?

293
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:15,920
她比我大两岁 当时是六二年
She was two years older than me,and that was '62.

294
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,990
那她就二十七岁
Yeah, so she was about 27.

295
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,970
那年我妈妈去世了
My mum died that year.

296
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,920
- 真的  - 对啊
- Did she?  - Yeah. Mm.

297
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,050
- 我不知道为什么我会觉得很好玩  - 好玩
- I don't know why that's funny but it is.  - Funny?

298
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:33,260
那时我们还不认识
Well, we didn't know each other then,you and I,

299
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,520
可我们都经历了十分不愉快的事
but we were both going through something really unpleasant, and...

300
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,850
而我们在一起这么多年了 也没聊过这些
And yet we never talked about it in all the years that we've known each other.

301
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:45,400
- 从来没有  - 是啊
- Never.  - No. Never have.

302
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,630
我累了
I'm tired.

303
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,000
那我关灯了
Shall I tum off the light?

304
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,010
好的
Yeah.

305
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,950
我也很累了
I'm quite tired, too.

306
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:40,010

Do you think my library card will still be valid, Kate?

316
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:58,080
- 应该可以吧  - 如果有时间 我想去趟图书馆
- I don't see why not.  - I might pop in there if there's time.

准备好了 叫我就行
Give a shout when you're ready,

321

- 什么的书  - 气候变化
- On what?  - Climate change.

325
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,180
- 不好意思来晚了  - 不要紧

326
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,220
- 买了吗  - 买什么
- Did you get the thing?  - What thing?

327

- 浮球阀呀  - 他们需要订购

想吃什么
What do you want to eat?

330
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,190
我们要多为环境着想
We've got to think a lot more about the environment.

331
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,650
- 我们有循环利用  - 真的
- Well, we recycle.  - Do we?

332
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,610
- 我有在尝试  - 我们应该这么做
- Yeah. Well, I try to, anyway.  - Well, we should.

333
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:23,540
你可以去收拾狗罐头 然后放进对应的垃圾箱
You're welcome to clean out the dog cans and put them in the right bins,

334
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:27,710
因为环境原因 冰川比我们想象的融的快
Because these glaciers, they're melting a Iot, more than people imagined,

335
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,080
- 海平面不会下降  - 水会流向某些地方的吧
- and the water's just not coming down.- It's got to go somewhere.

336
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,760
不会的 水渗透进岩石层 它不断变大变大
No, it's saturating into the rock beneath,and it's building up and up and up.

337
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:36,960
- 就像…  - 和大坝一样
- L-Like...- Like a dam.

338
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,890
对 然后耐心等待… 直到…
Like a dam, yeah. it's waiting,waiting, waiting, and then...

339
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,100
小心点 没有任何警告
Careful. No warning.

340
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:49,150
海啸降临 卷走所有的一切
Come down like a tsunami,wipe out everything in its path.

341
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:54,650
学校 教堂 喝咖啡的人
Schools, churches, people in cafes drinking their coffee.

342
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,700
还有商店里摆弄布谷鸟钟的老头
Old men in shops tinkering with their cuckoo clocks.

343
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:02,450
要是他没被发现 海啸也会带她出现
And if they hadn't found her,that's when she'd have come down,

344
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:04,910
以及碎石瓦砾
with all the rock and debris.

345
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,080
那时候我们都死绝了
We'll be long dead by then.

346
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,590
把书拿开
Put your book away.

347
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,760

- 是吧  - 莎莉要成为一名摄影师
- Aren't they?  - Sally's going to be a photographer.

356

我没有 我就是在上夜校 只是喜欢而已
I'm not. I'm just taking an evening course, just for the fun of it.

357
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,620
没什么值得一提的
It's nothing grand.

358
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,200
- 说不定就有戏呢  - 很难说
- But it might lead to something.- Or it might not.

359
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,790
我三个月前开始的
I took it up about three months ago.

360
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:01,470
尤克里里真是个值得一学的乐器 什么音乐都能演奏
It's a good instrument to Iearn,You can play anything on the ukulele.

361
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:06,600
[乔治·福姆比 英国演员 时常弹奏尤克里里(夏威夷四弦琴)]
不仅仅乔治·福姆比会弹 你也知道 我不喜欢他
It's not just George Formby, which is good. Because, as you know, I always hated him.

362
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,890
网络实在太棒了
The Internet is absolutely brilliant.

363
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:12,100
你去一个叫justinguitar的网站
If you go to a guy called justinguitar.com,

364
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,560
会免费教你弹吉他
he actually teaches guitar,but it's all free.

365
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,060
也开始教尤克里里了
He's started, er,teaching ukulele as well.

366
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,610

好的 再见
All right, see you later.

368
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,070
杰夫不太想去酒吧
I don't think...l don't think Geoff wanted to go to the pub.

369
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,150
不然他就得和我们一起逛街
It's either that or he comes shopping with us.

370
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,910
我们可以一起去酒吧啊
We could have gone to the pub,all of us.

371
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,860
看看他白天喝酒的样子
Know what he's like with daytime drinking.

372
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,620
他不会有事的
Oh, he'll be all right,

373
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,950
这也是发泄的好机会
Anyway, it gives him a chance to vent.

374
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,790
- 发泄什么  - 说你啊
- About what?- About you.

375
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,210
妈
Mum!

376
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:39,130
不说你 也要说派对吧
Not about you as such,but about the party.

377
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,430
你这是什么意思 发泄一下派对
What do you mean about...vent about the party?

378
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,220
想到乔治在我们四十周年前的态度
When I think how awful George was before our 40th,

379
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,090
我差点就和他离婚了
I was that close to divorcing him.

380
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,520
别理我妈
Ignore her.

381
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:50,470
选好礼服了吗 喜欢什么样的
So, what's going to happen with your dress? What would you like?

382
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,730
那我还要不要办派对啊
So, should I not be having a party?

383
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,520
当然要
Of course you should,

384
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,400
对我们压力都很大
It is a lot of pressure for both of us.

385
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,780
再说我也不会喜欢派对
And I hate parties anyway,at the best of times.

386
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,080
我连生日都不庆祝
I mean, I never even celebrate my birthday.

387
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,530
不能这么想 派对得办
No. no, no, no, no, You have to.

388
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,490
说来也奇怪
I mean, that's the strange thing.

389
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:15,080
乔治态度是很差 但你记得他在派对上的表现吗
George was awful, but then do you remember him at the actual party?

390
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,660
他哭得多厉害
How much he cried?

391
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,840
不仅是在讲话的时候
And not only during the speeches.

392
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,710
是啊 他很贴心
Yeah, he was very sweet.

393
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,380
所以说派对很重要
That's why these things are important.

394
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,060
让丈夫都去抹眼泪
What, to make our husbands cry

395
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:30,430
不止丈夫 是所有男人
Not just husbands, all men.

396
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,680
伤心的总是他们
It's always them that break first.

397
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,770
莎莉的婚礼 查理的洗礼
Sally's wedding, Charley's christening.

398
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:39,350
我们没崩溃 是因为我们知道这些事的重要性
We hold it together cos we already know how important these things are.

399
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,690
可杰夫不爱哭啊
Geoff is not much of a crier.

400
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,870
结婚的时候他肯定哭了
I bet he cried at your wedding.

401
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,010
记不得了
I don't remember.

402
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,970
男人的世界观和女人的就是不一样
I think they just see the world different from us.

403
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,000
要是进化能让
If some twist of evolution

404
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,550
男人沉迷于讣告与遗产
that needs men to be obsessed by their obituaries, their legacies,

405
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,720
是我们 在他们死于沮丧前
then maybe it's ours to nudge them into realising what's really important

406
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,550
让他们认识到什么才是关键
before they kill themselves,you know, with the disappointment.

407
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,200
早上好 
Morning.

408
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,400
我打了会儿盹
I nodded off.

409
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,620
你觉得莎莉的照片如何
What did you think of Sally's photos?

410
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,580
- 啊  - 莎莉的照片
- Mm?- Sally's photos.

411
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,330
她眼光不错
I think she's got a very good eye.

412
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,410
是啊 是啊
Oh, sure. Yeah. Mm.

413
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:45,590
有时候真遗憾屋里没什么照片
I sometimes think it's a shame not to have more photos around the house.

414
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,970
那我们就挂起来
We could put some up.

415
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,140
可我们没什么照片
Yeah. but we don't have any. Not really.

416
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:54,810
不像Lena家的照片墙一样
I mean, not like Lena does with her wall display.

417
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:06,150
可能是因为他们子孙满堂吧
I suppose it's because they've got children and grandchildren, and...

418
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:12,830
我们可能没意识到拍照的重要性吧
I guess we didn't see the point of taking pictures of ourselves.

419
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,490
是不是有点自大了
Would have been a bit vain.

420
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:19,450
以前你说那些总是拍照的人
You used to say that everybody taking pictures all the time

421
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,960
是在阻止别人享受
stopped anyone having any fun.

422
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,910
- 是吗  - 是你说的
- Did I?- You did.

423
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,340
听起来像我说出的话
Sounds like something I'd say.

424
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,640
以前你也有个照相机
You had a camera, once.

425
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,710
- 对 一台雅西卡  - 对 雅西卡
- Yeah, a Yashica.- Mm, a Yashica.

426
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,170
我还留着呢
Yeah, I've still got it.

427
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,350
在阁楼里放着
It's in the loft.

428
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,110
现在老了 感觉真是遗憾
Now that we're older, though,it...it's a shame.

429
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,320
那你想拍点什么呢
What would you want photos of?

430
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:54,330
马克斯还是小狗时的样子
Max when he was a pup.

431
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,120
还有之前的泰莎
Tessa before him

432
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:03,050
还有你 在装修的时候 把钉子扎进你手里
You when you were decorating Clitheroe and you hammered that nail into your hand.

433
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,540
你拍那个干什么
You want a photograph of that?

434
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,960
你明白我的意思
Oh, you know what I mean.

435
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,040
那是我们第一个家
It was our first house.

436
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,220
是啊
It was.

437
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:14,300
那是我离家之后的第一个家
Yeah, it was my first home since leaving home,

438
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,980
离开父母 离开我父亲
since leaving my parents, leaving my father.

439
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:25,400
当时我们没意识到
I suppose we don't realise at the time

440
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,070
那些记忆…
but those memories...

441
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,440
十分珍贵
..they're the things, aren't they?

442
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:39,620
我想拍你在利兹购物中心的样子
I'd want a picture of you at the Leeds Mecca.

443
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,380
那是我们相遇的地方
That's where we met.

444
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,840
你可是万人迷啊
You were a bloody knockout.

445
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,880
回想以前的我们
Oh, it's odd, isn't it,

446
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,880
还真有点奇怪
thinking of us back then?

447
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,840
我还没二十岁 你很酷 嘴里叼根烟
I wasn't even 20, and you were so cool,with your cigarette hanging in your mouth.

448
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:01,100
来
Tell you what.

449
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,310
- 你要做什么  - 来嘛
- What are you doing?  - Come on.

450
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:05,060
- 我们能跳…  - 走开
- We can move the...  - Oh, bugger off!

451
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,270
来
Come on.

452
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:09,900
我可不想那么晚了在客厅里蹦跶
I'm not prancing around in the living room at this time of night.

00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,120
是啊
No.

467
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,300
我们上楼吧
Let's go upstairs.

468
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:36,360
快来
Come on with ya.

469
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:48,120
希望我记得你做的这些
Hope I can remember what you do.

470
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,920
我做给你看
I'll show you.

471
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,260
- 怎么样了  - 我准备好了
- How are you doing down there?  - I think I'm ready.

472
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:05,350
- 要不要我在上面  - 不了 差不多了
- You don't want me to go on top?  - No, I'm nearly there.

473
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,230
噢 是哦
Oh, you are, too.

474
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,350
噢 进来了
Oh, there you go.

475
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,070
亲一个
A kiss.

476
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,170
张开眼睛
Open your eyes,

477
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,300
- 呃…  - 擦
- Uh...  - Oh, shit.

478
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,630
哎
Oh, bugger.

479
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,390
- 我觉得我不行了  - 我…
- I think I've lost it.- l..,

480
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,980
没事的
OK, OK, OK.

481
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:55,610
杰夫 没事的
Geoff, it's OK, it's OK.

482
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:09,330
还是睡觉吧
No, let's just go to sleep.

483
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,570
杰夫
Geoff?

484
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,700
你在做什么
What are you doing?

485
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,950
- 杰夫  - 凯特 我没事
- Geoff?  - I'm OK, Kate.

486
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,710
快下来 你疯了吗
Please come down. This is ridiculous.

487
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,880
我没事
I'm OK.

488
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,580
你手里拿着什么
What's that in your hand?

489
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,340
什么也没有
Nothing.

490
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,510
- 她的照片  - 我突然看见的
- Is it her?  - I found it.

491
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:49,720
骗人 你半夜爬起来找这个
You didn't find it. You went looking for it in the middle of the night

492
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,550
这是两码事
and that's not the same thing at all.

493
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,260
- 给我看看  - 不行
- Let me see it.  - No.

494
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,720
杰夫 我看看
Please, Geoff. Can I see it?

495
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:59,060
凯特 回去睡觉吧
Please, Kate, just go back to bed.

496
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,240
把照片给我看
Show me the bloody picture!

497
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,200
就是张照片而已
It's just a picture. It's all it is.

498
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,990
没什么别的意思 就是张照片
It doesn't mean anything.it's just a fucking picture.

499
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:26,390
谢谢
Thanks.

500
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:42,960
星期三

501
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,120
快来
Come on!

502
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:29,070
周六有人给你化妆吗
Are you getting someone to do your makeup on Saturday?

503
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,240
我都没想这事
I wasn't thinking of it.

504
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,450
我认识个女孩 很懂察言观色
I know this girl. She's very subtle.

505
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:37,000
她不是那种行为不检点的人
You wouldn't have to worry about looking like a hooker.

506
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:44,880
莎莉有个神器 能消除黑眼圈
Sally's got this amazing roll-on thing, zaps away dark circles.

507
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,460
可以借你用用
I'm sure you could borrow it.

508
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,920
我看上去很疲倦的时候 要告诉我
If I'm looking tired, you can just tell me.

509
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,130
那就是现在
You're looking tired.

510
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:58,560
我很好
I'm fine.

511
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:01,480
这天气真是的
Ugh, this weather.

512
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,020
我跟你说的都是乔治告诉我的
I'm just telling you what George said.

513
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,950
我不是存心让你不高兴的
I'm not trying to upset you. Really, I'm not.

514
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,370
我没有不高兴 你也没说什么呀
I'm not upset, but you're not telling me anything.

515
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,200
你就说杰夫性情乖僻
You're just saying that Geoff was in a strange mood.

516
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,370
乔治是这么说的
That's what George said,

517
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,830
杰夫有说什么吗
Did Geoff say anything?

518
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,710
比如
Like what?

519
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,500
我还在问你呢
That's what I'm asking you.

520
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:27,000
- 关于派对吗  - 不是派对的事
- About the party?  - No, not about the party.

521
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,460
他们大谈政事
They were talking politics.

522
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,590
没了
That's it?

523
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,420
他十分激进
Well, he was very aggressive.

524
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,130
我相信乔治能很好的为自己辩解
Well, I'm sure George can stand up for himself.

525
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,260
和以前没什么两样
He was acting like he used to.

526
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,440
什么意思
Meaning?

527
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,270
就像有次在我生日上 他一直在我朋友面前
Like that time he kept accusing me of being a fascist

528
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:45,440
说我是法西斯
in front of all my friends at my birthday

529
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,360
就因为我敢说撒切尔抵抗法西斯
just because I dared to say that Thatcher hadn't done such a bad job of it.

530
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,530
再说 我都没投票给她
I mean, I hadn't even voted for her.

531
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,030
凯特 哪里好笑了
It wasn't funny, Kate,

532
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,660
是不好笑
No.

533
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,030
真冒火
Very upsetting.

534
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:00,210
他总是做纳粹敬礼姿势
He kept doing a Nazi salute.

535
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:06,500
好吧 是有点好笑
All right, it was a little bit funny.

536
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,630
对不起
Oh, I'm sorry,

537
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,550
我不应该提起这事的
I shouldn't have brought it up.

538
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:16,010
你知道杰夫是怎样的人
You know what Geoff's like.

539
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:18,680
他对事总是过度热情
He gets over-passionate about things.

540
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,230
这不就是你爱上他的原因吗
I suppose that's why you fell in love with him.

541
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,270
没错
Yes.

542
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,450
噢 还有件事
Oh, er, there's another thing.

543
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:41,000
什么
What?

544
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:44,540
杰夫还说他不确定要不要去工作午餐会
Geoff says he's not sure that he wants to go to the works lunch.

545
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:45,870
在克劳利餐馆的
At Crawley's?

546
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:47,670
- 那不就是明天嘛  - 是啊
- But it's tomorrow.  - I know.

547
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,290
都组织这么久了
And it's been organised for so long,

548
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:52,470
乔治很想几个老友聚在一起 要是…
George was looking forward to getting the old gang together but if...

549
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,090
他有说原因吗
Well, did he say why?

550
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:56,260
没说
Don't think so.

551
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,600
我跟他说
I'll speak to him.

552
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,270
不要紧的
Er, maybe it doesn't matter.

553
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,440
不行 我去问他
No, I'll speak to him.

554
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:16,780
女士们
Ladies...

555
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,410
需要吗
Full, full?

556
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,610
需要加奶吗
Do you want more milk?

557
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,290
好
Yes.

558
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:28,710
饼干要吗
Biscuit? No?

559
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:32,040
不要吗
No?

560
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,590
那我放这了 我吃一块
Well, I'll leave them there. And I'll take one.

561
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,210
- 谢谢  - 之后
- Thank you.  - After that,

562
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:39,420
商人使用这新凿的航道
the merchants used these newly created waterways,

563
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,560
这些年来 航道越来越深 越来越宽
and over the years they were cut deeper and widen

564
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:46,230
布罗兹区才会是现在的模样
and this is why the Broads are as they are today

565
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,060
供大家观赏
for all of you to enjoy.

566
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:53,650
想想如果那些罗马人在别的地方找到泥炭
Now, just imagine if those Roman shad found peat elsewhere

567
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:57,230
或选择其他地区来开凿
or chosen to dig in another part of the country.

568
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,410
这片区域就不复存在了
Then these broads wouldn't be here at all.

569
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,010
那是杰夫吗
Is that Geoff?

570
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:42,050
没错 
Yes, it is.

571
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:44,220
他在干吗
What's he doing?

572
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,430
怎么又抽上烟了
Is he smoking again?

573
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:48,640
是的
Look's like it.

574
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:54,690
周六前要给他剃个胡子
You should get him to shave before the big day too.

575
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,750
- 嗨 杰弗里 -嗨 Lena
- Hello, Geoffrey.  - Hello, Lena.

576
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:21,470
讲话准备好了吗
Hope you've got your speech prepared.

577
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,340
周六 说点愉快的事
I want to hear nice things about Kate on Saturday.

578
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:35,020
听说你不想去午餐会
So, I hear you don't want to go to the Crawley's lunch.

579
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,520
我倒是不介意 但我想知道缘由
I don't mind if you don't,but I wondered why.

580
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,700
就是不想去
I just don't.

581
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:45,780
你一直都想见你的工友们
You've been looking forward to seeing everyone again.

582
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:47,830
前几周你一直都在说这事儿
You've been talking about it for weeks,

583
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:52,120
- 你干吗不去  - 我自有原因
- Why don't you want to go?  - I've got me reasons.

584
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,420
什么原因
Which are?

585
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:55,990
我去不去和你有什么关系
Why does it matter to you if I go or not?

586
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,830
是没有 但都安排好了
It doesn't, but it's been arranged.

587
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:59,000
那又怎样
So?

588
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:04,010
那你也不能因为心情不好就简单拒绝不去啊
So you can't just back out of things simply because you don't feel like it.

589
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,180
即便你有理由
Even when you have reasons.

590
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:14,770
乔治会伤心的
And George will be very upset.

591
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:18,190
他都准备好几周了
He's...well, he's been organising it for weeks.

592
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,360
- 他是你朋友  - 好 我去
- And he's your friend.  - Oh, fine.

593
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:24,110
- 那你会去  - 我不是说了吗
- Then you'll go?  - Well, that's what I said, didn't I?

594
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:35,540
有天 我们忘了要去意大利的事 就呆在原地
Some days, we forgot all about getting to Italy. Just stayed put.

595
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,660
我们心不在焉
We were being heedless.

596
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,340
就是这个词
I think that's the word I'm looking for,

597
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:41,630
心不在焉
Heedless?

598
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,800
对
Heedless.

599
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,390
在柏林 柏林墙还在
Back in her Berlin, the Wall was going up

600
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:49,930
[猪湾事件：美国阴谋以武力支持古巴流亡者颠覆古巴革命政权]
在美国 我们有猪湾事件
and in America, we'd just had the Bay of Pigs.

601
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:55,470
而在那儿 我们什么都不想
But up there, we weren't thinking about all that.

602
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:58,940
不想未来
Weren't thinking about our future.

603
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:02,150
同时 我们也十分谨慎
But, at the same time,we weren't heedless at all.

604
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:05,110
知晓你的目标 每天活得都有目的
How can you be when,when you know what your purpose is?

605
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:08,360
你怎么还能心不在焉呢
When every day seems to have some point to it.

606
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,790
找到居所 找到食物
Finding somewhere to stay, finding food.

607
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,960
我们不出去的日子
And the days we didn't go anywhere,

608
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:15,540
充满目标
they seemed just as purposeful

609
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:20,920
就像我们早上四点出发一样 满心目标
as when we set out in complete seriousness at four in the fucking morning.

610
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:28,010
我觉得 这就是衰老最糟之处
I-I think, um.., I think that's the worst part of getting decrepit,

611
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:31,720
失去生活的意义
losing that...purposefulness,

612
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:37,980
我记得今天种花时的场景
I-I was remembering today how we used to seed these flowers.

613
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,190
是紫罗兰吧
Some sort of violet, I think they were.

614
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:46,650
在雪融之处找一块草
They'd find a patch of grass where the snow had melted

615
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:48,820
它们就能迅速生长
and they'd just spring up.

616
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:53,290
我知道它们就是花 可十分决然
I know they were only flowers, but they seemed so determined.

617
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,450
甚至有点勇敢
Brave, even.

618
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,040
我也是这样看我和卡蒂亚的
And that's how I see Katya and me.

619
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,960
游走四方 远离尘嚣
Wandering around, turning our backs on civilisation.

620
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,470
很勇敢
Brave?

621
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,640
可以这么说
In a way.

622
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,680
你不觉得吗
Don't you think?

623
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,260
没觉得
Not really.

624
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:15,310
为什么
Why not?

625
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,850
你们都做了些什么
I mean, what were you actually doing?

626
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:20,600
你们不就是爬山吗
You're just climbing up some bloody mountain.

627
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:25,070
我不是说我们的行为是勇敢者的做法
Well, I'm not saying what we did was out of bravery.

628
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:31,610
我觉得这就是你情我愿的事
I think you were just chasing a girl who wanted to be chased.

629
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,120
你不了解她
You didn't know her.

630
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:43,950
是的
No.

631
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,710
我不了解她
I didn't.

632
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:50,930
我累了
I'm tired.

633
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:54,840
睡之前 我先问你点事
I want to ask you something before we go to sleep.

634
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,020
什么
What's that?

635
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:05,560
如果她还活着 你们也到了意大利
She hadn't died, you had got to Italy,

636
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,770
你会娶她吗
would you have married her for real?

637
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:12,360
可我们没去成啊
But we didn't get to Italy, did we?

638
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,910
而她也死了
And she did die.

639
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,910
没错 但如果呢
Yeah, but if you had.

640
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:20,240
你不是讨厌假定问题吗
I thought you didn't like theoretical questions.

641
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,370
回答我
Just answer me.

642
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,290
我会娶她
Yes.

643
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,590
你会娶她
Yes, you would have married her?

644
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:34,510
是的
Yes.

645
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,850
我们会结婚
We would have married each other.

646
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:53,740
以后不能在谈及她的事了
I don't think I can talk about her any more.

647
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:59,780
我虽然说过 但我做不动
I know I said I could, but I can't.

648
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:17,640
星期四

649
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:32,080
有认识的人吗
Anyone you know still there?

650
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,260
什么 没有 都是新来的
What? No, they're all new.

651
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:46,060
那行 晚点见
OK, then, I'll see you later.

652
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,890
好
Yeah.

653
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:50,060
等会儿
Hang on.

654
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:52,930
今天尽量玩的开心点
Just try and enjoy yourself today.

655
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,110
我尽量
Yeah. I'll try.

656
01:00:58,230 --> 01:00:59,830

662
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:15,340

How was it?

678
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:25,720
没完没了
Fucking endless.

679
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:29,720
难以相信 他们如此糟蹋这地方
You wouldn't fucking believe what they've done to the place.

680
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,640
现在都成流水线了
It's all been streamlined.

681
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:35,020
我的第一份饭碗都不存在了
My first job on the floor doesn't exist any more.

682
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:39,100
要是我在管理层 我绝对不容许这样的事发生
I tell you, if I was still in management,I wouldn't have let that happen.

683
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,490
工会一点也不在乎
And the unions, they don't give a shit.

684
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:45,070
或者他们有所作为 也没人鸟他们
Well, maybe they do and nobody takes any notice.

685
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:55,960
小伙子们都老了 不帅了
A-And how the lads have descended into old age, it's not pretty.

686
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:00,090
乔治他一直在说他那个尤克里里
And there's George,waning on about his fucking ukulele.

687
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:03,010
最糟的是 其他人还很感兴趣的样子
The worst part of it is that they all seemed interested.

688
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:07,460
还有莱恩 他在葡萄牙有个别墅
And Len, he's got a villa on the Algarve.

689
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:09,270
还记得红头莱恩吗
Do you remember Red Len?

690
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:11,090
我们都叫他Len-in
We used to call him Len-in,

691
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:16,060
现在他说的都是在葡萄牙打高尔夫
and now all he can talk about is playing golf on the AI-fucking-garve

692
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:18,390
和他那当银行家的孙子
with his grandson, who's a banker.

693
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,900
红头莱恩有个当银行家的孙子
Red Len, with a banker for a grandson.

694
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:23,230
真操蛋
Fuck me!

695
01:06:56,290 --> 01:07:01,300
星期五

696
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:50,640
[我自己坐公交去镇上了，抱歉！]

697
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:59,760
下午好 能耽误几分钟吗
Good afternoon, love. Spare a couple of minutes?

698
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:02,590
能给您介绍一下我们的慈善项目吗
I'd love to tell you a bit about this charity we've got going on.

699
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,300
不太感兴趣
Um, I'm not interested.

700
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:05,810
没关系的
No? No problem.

701
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,550
有什么能帮您的吗
Can I help you?

702
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:39,630
- 能坐下说吗  - 当然
- May I sit down?  - Yeah, please do.

703
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:43,510
- 想去哪儿旅行呢  - 我不是…
- Is there somewhere you have in mind?  - No, I...

704
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:46,470
我就想知道一个男的来过没有
I want to know if a man has been in here.

705
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:48,300
我丈夫
It's my husband.

706
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:51,520
我们参加过几次你们旅行社 我想知道他来过没
We've used you a few times and I wondered if he'd been in.

707
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,770
咨询去瑞士的那位先生
Um, was he enquiring about Switzerland?

708
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:30,700
- 怎么去了这么久  - 对不起
- Been a long time.  - Yeah, sorry.

709
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:32,200
我去…
I've been...

710
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:35,910
镇上很挤 回来的公交也…
Well, town was very busy and the bus back was... Sorry.

711
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,120
今天我去了趟旅行社
I went to the travel agent today.

712
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:43,210
- 哪儿  - 旅行社
- What?- I went to the travel agent.

713
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:46,810
你打算去瑞士
Are you going to Switzerland?

714
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:52,270
- 没有  - 干嘛不去
- No. I'm not.  - Why not?

715
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:56,100
不中途坐下休息 我连村庄都到不了
Well, I can't walk to the village without... without sitting down.

716
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:58,310
我还爬什么山啊
How am I going to climb a fucking mountain?

717
01:11:58,390 --> 01:11:59,740
就因为这个
And that's the reason?

718
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:01,360
凯特 这不是原因
No, Kate, that's not the reason.

719
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,310
要是你真的去了 我…
Because if you do go, and if I,..

720
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,990
凯特 这跟卡蒂亚没关系
Oh, Christ, Kate. This isn't about Katya.

721
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:08,160
求你 不要说她的名字
Please, Stop saying her name.

722
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,740
- 我受不了  - 这跟卡蒂亚没关系
- I can't bear it.  - It isn't... It isn't about Katya.

723
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:11,990
有关系
It is.

724
01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:14,170
当然脱不了干系
Of course it is.

725
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,830
我发现屋子里总有股味道
Like me discovering what this smell is around the house.

726
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:20,380
- 别这样  - 是她的香水味吧
- Oh, please.  - And it's her perfume, OK?

727
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:24,460
好像他一直在墙角那站着
It's like she's been standing in the corner of the room all this time,

728
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,640
- 就在我身后  - 别瞎说
- behind my back.  - Oh, come on.

729
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:30,930
玷污一切
And it's tainted everything.

730
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:34,680
我们的决定 去哪儿度假 看什么样的书
All our decisions, where we go on holiday, what books we read,

731
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,890
养什么样的狗 听什么样的音乐
what dog you want to choose, what music we want to listen to.

732
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,360
大事也归她管
And the big things, too.

733
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:42,530
特别是这些事
Especially the big things.

734
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:46,570
这些都不关她的事
She's had nothing to do with any of that.

735
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:53,870
我想跟你说我脑子里的事
I'd like to be able to tell you everything I'm...thinking,

736
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,040
我知道的一切
and everything I know,

737
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,210
但我做不到
but I can't.

738
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:01,710
我明白这种感受吗
Do you understand that?

739
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:04,680
明白
Yeah.

740
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:06,890
我明白
Yes, I do.

741
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:24,940
我现在只想你明天能赴约
All I want now is for you to just come to the party tomorrow.

742
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:27,950
- 我当然会去  - 我要你的心也去
- Of course I'm going to come.  - I really need you to want to be there.

743
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:29,990
我是真心的
Yes, I do want to be there.

744
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:33,290
我知道 我满足不了你
Because it's one thing me knowing. I haven't been enough for you.

745
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,460
这…
It's something...

746
01:13:36,570 --> 01:13:39,920
凑在一起就变味了 大家也看在眼里
altogether different that everyone else feels it, too.

747
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:42,790
你觉得你满足不了我
You really believe you haven't been enough for me?

748
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:44,970
不是 我觉得我做到了
No. I think I was enough for you,

749
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,010
我不确定你也这么想
I'm just not sure you do.

750
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:52,350
凯特 哎
Ah, Kata.

751
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:55,560
不要这么想
That's terrible.

752
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:00,810
- 今天吃药的吗  - 还没
- Have you taken your pills today?  - No.

753
01:14:00,890 --> 01:14:03,360
那我去帮你拿
Then I'm going to get them.

754
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:07,310
然后我们照常吃饭 睡觉
And then we're going to have dinner, and then we're going to go to bed.

755
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:10,120
当什么也没发生 照常起床
And then we're going to get up.

756
01:14:11,610 --> 01:14:13,700
我们试着重新开始
And we'll try and start again.

757
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:16,710
凯特 可以 我能做到
OK, Kate, I can do that.

758
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:20,740
我们可以的
We can do that.

759
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,160
我保证
I promise.

760
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:30,160
星期六

761
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:46,110
早上好
Morning.

762
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:47,610
我给你泡了茶
I made you some tea.

763
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:52,900
我修好抽水马桶了 还没伤到手
I've managed to fix the lavatory without cutting me finger off.

764
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:56,780
起晚了吗
Is it late?

765
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:59,120
我想做点炒鸡蛋
Y-Yeah, I thought I'd make us some scrambled eggs

766
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,290
然后我们带马克斯去散步
and then we can take Max for a walk.

767
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:04,950
- 好  - 就这样
- Great.  - Right.

768
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:07,130
马上就来
Will do.

769
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:10,340
我们还有鸡蛋吧
Yeah, we have got some eggs, haven't we?

770
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:37,080
在我我看到过一只旋木雀 一种可爱的小鸟
I saw a tree creeper here,once, a lovely little bird.

771
01:15:37,150 --> 01:15:42,580
人们说 它会飞到树的底部 然后再飞上去
Somebody told me that they fly down to the bottom of the tree and work their way up.

772
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:47,540
而五子雀 喜欢从上飞到下
And nuthatches, they fly to the top of the trunk, work their way down.

773
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:49,840
来来 好孩子
Come on. Come on. Good boy.

774
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:53,180
- 你以前很喜欢观鸟  - 是啊
- You used to love your birdwatching. -I did, yes.

775
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:56,470
你却忘记了那些让你快乐的事 多好笑啊
It's funny how you forget the things in life that make you happy.

776
01:15:57,550 --> 01:15:59,640
马克斯 呆在这
Stay there, Max.

777
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:25,710
找到了 马克斯
Found it, Max.

778
01:19:56,580 --> 01:19:58,500
对不起 没给你准备礼物
Again, I'm sorry. I didn't get you anything...

779
01:19:58,580 --> 01:20:00,670
别傻了
Oh, don't be silly.

780
01:20:00,830 --> 01:20:02,210
很漂亮
This is very beautiful.

781
01:20:02,290 --> 01:20:04,390
很高兴你喜欢
I'm glad you like it.

782
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:07,130
本来想给你买块表的
I was going to get you a watch.

783
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:11,090
想刻字的 但没想好刻什么
I was thinking of having it engraved, but I wasn't sure what to write.

784
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:14,520
不要刻时间就好
I like not knowing the time.

785
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,900
- 我就是做不到  - 是的
- I just couldn't do it.  - No.

786
01:20:58,970 --> 01:21:02,570
亲爱的 别担心 没人逼你  - 大多数人都不想做的
- Don't worry, darling, you don't have to.  - Most people don't want to.

787
01:21:39,010 --> 01:21:41,480
跟我来 带你看样东西
Will you come with me? I've got something to show you.

788
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:44,690
莱娜 我不想要惊喜
No surprises, Lena. I don't want a surprise.

789
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:50,780
- 哇  - 不错吧
- Wow.  - Isn't it wonderful?

790
01:21:50,860 --> 01:21:52,910
看看
Look at this. Yes.

791
01:21:52,990 --> 01:21:55,870
- 莱娜 那是什么  - 过来看看
- Lena, what's that?  - Ah, come and have a look.

792
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,170
照片
Photos.

793
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:05,590
- 哪找来的  - 我从大伙那儿搜刮来的
- Where did they all come from?  - I rang round. Everyone contributed.

794
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:07,130
大多数都是我的
Most of them are mine.

795
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:09,590
凯特 看 你多美啊
Look, Kate, look how beautiful you are.

796
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:13,350
凯特 泰莎小狗时的样子
Kate. There's Tessa when she was a puppy.

797
01:22:13,420 --> 01:22:17,180
还有我瞪着眼睛 再剪草
Ah, there's me...me and me goggles,strimming

798
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:18,390
剪草
Strimming.

799
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:20,810
- 看我们 还记得吗  - 埃及之旅
- Look at us there. Remember that?  - Egypt.

800
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:22,270
对 我们去埃及的时候
Yeah, when we went to Egypt.

801
01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:24,400
我们都好美
Gorgeous, we both are.

802
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,980
莱娜 这太好了 谢谢
Lena, this is wonderful. Thank you.

803
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:28,780
我这个法西斯做的不错吧
Not bad for an old fascist, huh?

804
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:30,950
很不错
Yeah, not bad at all.

805
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:34,490
- 我等着听你说话呢  - 都在脑子里
- Oh, I can't wait to hear your speech.  - Yeah, it's all in here.

806
01:22:34,570 --> 01:22:37,620
- 那我们就麻烦了  - 特别是你
- Ugh, we're all in trouble then.  - Yeah, especially you.

807
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:39,330
等着看那些眼泪吧
Just you wait for those tears.

808
01:22:39,410 --> 01:22:41,410
- 那是谁  - 是Arthur吧
- Who's that?  - That's Arthur, I think.

809
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:42,710
- 对对  - 是他
- Yes, it is.  - Yes.

810
01:22:42,790 --> 01:22:46,260
- 是几年后的他  - 我看看还有谁
- Yeah, it's Arthur, a few years ago.  - And who else do I see?

811
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:17,120
女士们先生们 大家期待已久的时刻到了
Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for.

812
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:20,620
掌声有请 杰弗里 默瑟先生
I give you...Mr Geoffrey Mercer.

813
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:22,160
去吧 杰弗里
Go on, Geoffrey.

814
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,800
听得见吗
Now, can you hear me?

815
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:31,970
- 听得见  - 好
- We can hear you.  - Yes.

816
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:36,880
我尽量不说胡话
I'd better try and make sense, then.

817
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:42,350
感谢大家今天能到场
Well, I'd like to thank you all first, offer being here this evening.

818
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:47,480
一些人会想起我的心脏手术
Some of you may recall that, er...my bypass,

819
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:53,320
几年前抢了风头 不管怎样 我们现在还在
er, upstaged things a few years ago, so. anyway, there we are.

820
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:59,030
我不怎么做这种讲话
Now, er, I'm not used to making this kind of speech

821
01:23:59,110 --> 01:24:01,830
也不会在这种场合讲话
on this, er...sort of occasion,

822
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:04,380
但…
but, er...well...

823
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:07,670
我尽力吧
I'll give it me best shot.

824
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:12,420
我们慢慢变老
As, um, as we get older.

825
01:24:13,170 --> 01:24:17,970
我们就不再做决定
We seem to stop, er, making choices.

826
01:24:18,050 --> 01:24:20,180
那种影响人生的决定
Big ones. anyway.

827
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:23,390
人一生中这样的决定可能是有限的吧
Perhaps we only get so many, er, in a lifetime,

828
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:27,570
用尽了 就不会再有
and once we've used them up, they're gone.

829
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:33,990
或者是我们的脑子腐朽陈旧了
Or maybe our brains, they just get a bit, er, old and arthritic,

830
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:36,490
像乔治的膝盖一样
like, er.,.like George's knee.

831
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:40,250
就这样吧
Er, whatever.

832
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:47,620
年轻时所做的决定
The upshot is that the choices we make when we're young

833
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:51,630
会影响你的一生
are pretty bloody important.

834
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:58,090
就像凯特和我做的决定
Er, like the choice, er,Kate and me made

835
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:02,260
四十五年前的今天
45 years ago...today_

836
01:25:03,970 --> 01:25:06,060
就是今天
Today.

837
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:15,610
事情也不都是如桃花源记般悠闲自得
Now, things... things haven't always been, er.,.idyllic.

838
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:21,700
和普通夫妻一样 我们也有兴衰沉浮
Er, like all couples, we've had our downs as, er,..as well as our ups.

839
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:24,910
我们都想…
We all, we all, er, think...

840
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,620
要是能换一种方式做事 就好了
W-We all wish we'd done some things,er, differently,

841
01:25:28,910 --> 01:25:32,670
要是不犯错就好了
wish we hadn't made certain mistakes,

842
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,970
但是
but, er...whatever...

843
01:25:38,090 --> 01:25:41,840
我得说 我必须要说
I have to say, and I need to say,

844
01:25:43,050 --> 01:25:49,810
凯特 说服你嫁给我
that persuading you, er, to marry me, Kate,

845
01:25:49,890 --> 01:25:52,480
是我做的最有意义的事
was the best thing I've ever done.

846
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:55,730
当然也是下了不少功夫的
Er, it took some doing, by the way.

847
01:25:55,810 --> 01:25:58,410
你父亲 我还是觉得
Yeah, so your father, I-I don't think he was convinced

848
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:00,580
他认为让你嫁给我是委屈了你
I was the greatest catch in the world.

849
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:03,570
我在想这是为什么
I wonder why that was.

850
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:07,200
不管这些了 说服你嫁给我
But anyway, er, persuading you to many me

851
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:11,080
是我做的最有意义的事
was the best thing I've ever done,

852
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:15,760
对不起 我真的
and, er, I'm sorry, I truly am,

853
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:20,880
你都不知道…
that, er, you haven't, er... you haven't always known that

854
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:24,340
对我来说 凯特…
because, er, well, for me, Kate,

855
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:29,930
这就是今天派对的原因
this is, er, this is what it's... what it's all about, what all this is about,

856
01:26:30,010 --> 01:26:33,610
大家…我们的朋友都欢聚一堂的原因
why all... why all our friends are here this evening.

857
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:37,230
是因为你和我
It's about, er... it's about you and me.

858
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,980
凯特 是因为你和我
You and me, Kate.

859
01:26:41,070 --> 01:26:42,910
我们的故事
Us.

860
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:44,700
是的
Yeah.

861
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:48,580
我就说这么多了
And I think, really,that's about all I've, er... got to say,

862
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:51,750
还有 我爱你
except that, er... l love you.

863
01:26:58,210 --> 01:26:59,590
我真的很爱你
I love you very much.

864
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:03,920
感谢你容忍了我这么多年
And thank you for standing by me through all these years

865
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:08,680
忍受我的胡言乱语 愿我们的爱情长存
and putting up with all my nonsense, and, er... long may it continue.

866
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:17,560
杰夫和凯特
Geoff and Kate!

867
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:19,740
杰夫和凯特
Geoff and Kate!

868
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:30,700
太棒了
It was fantastic. Wasn't it?

869
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:32,880
是的
It was.

870
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:55,100
现在…
And now...

871
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:59,780
让小两口来跳他们的第一支舞吧
Would the two lovebirds kindly take to the floor for the first dance?

872
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:05,240
我再插一句话
And for those of you that don't know, or weren't alive,

873
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:10,570
这是四十五年前他们婚礼时放的同一支歌
this is the very same song that was played 45 years ago today.

874
01:28:12,490 --> 01:28:14,870
有请默瑟夫妇
I give you Mr and Mrs Mercer.
