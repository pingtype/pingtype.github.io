我的天 我都忘了
Oh, my God, I completely forgot.

- How are you both coping?  - It's a hell of a lot of work.

14
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,130
那是肯定了
I don't doubt it a second.

15
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,670
但你没问题的 你是个能干的小伙子
But you'll be fine. You were always a capable young man.

16
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,050

17
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,750
- 周六 对吧？  - 别提了 还有一堆事情要做
- Saturday, isn't it?  - Don't remind me. So much work to do.

18
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,050
不过 没问题的
Yeah, it'll be fine.

19
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,880
- 祝你好运  - 谢谢
- Good luck.  - Thank you.

20
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,090
我真为你们俩高兴
And I'm really over the moon for both of you.

21
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,850
- 谢谢 梅瑟夫人  - 凯特 叫我凯特就好
- Thank you, Mrs Mercer.  - Kate. Call me Kate.

22
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,350
我们已经不是在学校里了
We're not at school any more.

什么时候放？
What for?

27
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,850
跳第一支舞时放
First dance.

28
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,860
还是你觉得我们婚礼上放的歌已经过时了？
Or think it's a bit naff to have the same song we had at our wedding?

29
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,480
不 这首歌很可爱
No. Lovely song.

30
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,360
- 我一直都很喜欢  - 我就知道
- I've always liked it.  - Yeah, I know.

- 这是什么？  - 一封信
- What is it?  - A letter.

34
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,980
嗯 我知道 谁寄的？
Yes, I know, but who from?

35
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,650
- 用德文写的  - 是啊
- It's in German.  - Yeah.

36
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,820
写的什么？
What's it say?

37
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:52,910
我记不清这些动词啊名词啊的意思了 但是…
Well, I can't remember the verbs as well as the nouns, but...

38
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,750
但我想上面写的是他们找到她了
but I think it says they've found her.

39
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,750
找到谁？
Found who?

40
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,250
唔 准确说 是她的尸体
Well, her body, anyway.

41
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,420
天呐 是谁？杰夫
God, who? Geoff.

42
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,550
他们找到了卡佳
T-They've found Katya.

43
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,050
噢
Oh.

44
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,350
你知道我在说谁吗？
Y-You know who I'm talking about, don't you?

45
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,600
当然
Of course.

46
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,770
因为 我记得我和你说过 一清二楚
'Cause, I-I remember telling you, clear as day.

47
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,400
我当然记得 我是说 这是很久以前的事了
Of course I remember. I mean, it was a long time ago.

48
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,690
我就知道我和你说过我的卡佳
Yeah, I-I know I told you about my Katya.

49
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:31,780
她在那儿五十多年了 就像在冷冻库里一样
She's been there over 50 years, like something in the freezer.

50
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,250
现在他们找到她了
Now they've found her.

[图伦男子：自然环境下形成的木乃伊，死于公元前四世纪却在一九五〇年才被发现]
就像那个 呃 瑞典沼泽里的图伦男子
L-Like that, er, Tollund Man in the Swedish bog.

52
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,630
其实是在丹麦被发现的
Well, Danish, actually.

53
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,580
- 嗯？  - 写进课本里好多年了
- Hm?  - It was on the curriculum for years.

54
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,790
我给三年级生教过这些
I taught it to the third-formers.

55
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,230
我再去泡点茶
I'll make some more tea.

56
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,110
嗯 我还需要一本字典
Yeah, I'm going to need a dictionary.

57
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,750
我不知道去哪找
I-I don't know where to look.

58
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,080
你为什么不看看塑料箱子里呢？
Why don't you check in the plastic boxes?

59
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,130
什么也没有 除了DIY书
Nothing. Nothing but "do-it-yourself" books.

60
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,980
就是这个
That's it.

61
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,940
是它
Yeah.

62
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,120
啊 谢啦
Ah, thank you.

63
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,460
你看 现在是雪全都融化掉了
You see, what's happened is the snow has completely melted.

64
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,880
只剩下了冰
All that's left is the ice.

65
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,370
他们就是这么找到她的
A-And that's how they found her.

66
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,960
- 什么意思？  - 就是 她还在那儿
- What do you mean?  - Well, she's still there.

67
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
- 冻在冰里？  - 是的
- In the ice?  - Yeah.

68
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,180
顺流下来了一些 可以肯定 但那儿的水非常清澈
Way down, I'm sure, but the water is very pure up there.

69
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,130
一定是这样 所以他们才能看见她
It must be, so they can see her.

70
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,140
- 他们把她弄出来了吗？  - 还没
- Well, haven't they taken her out?  - Not yet.

71
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,390
为什么？
Why not?

72
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,100
你想 她可是被冻在瑞士雪山的冰川里 凯特
Well, she's in a glacier in the Swiss mountains, Kate.

73
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,810
这可没那么容易
It can't be that easy.

74
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,990
根本没有公路上去
There are no roads up there.

75
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,360
那他们怎么确定那个人是她？
So, how do they know it's her?

76
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,990
我是说 可能根本就不是她
I mean, it might not be her at all.

77
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,320
唔 我猜 根据事发地点 他们推测这个人是她
Well, they've made an assumption, I suppose, from where they found her.

78
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,750
可能他们从衣物分辨出是她
Maybe they can tell from what she's wearing.

79
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,450
从她的衣物？
From what she's wearing?

80
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:48,380
噢 对 对 对 那些 飞行员… 冰岛的 应该是
Oh, yeah, yeah, th-those, er, airmen in... Iceland, I-I think it was

81
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,330
他们被保存得很完好
they were perfectly preserved.

82
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,920
噢 我居然忘了
Oh, I don't remember that.

83
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,750
我看过这方面的资料
Yes. I saw a documentary on it.

84
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,180
他们因为被迅速冰冻 和死前看上去一模一样
They were the same as when they died because of how quickly they froze.

85
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,510
你觉得是这么回事吗？
And you think that's what's happened?

86
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,310
嗯… 我不知道 但你可以想象
Well, I don't know, but you can imagine.

87
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,440
我不确定她也是那样 毕竟过了这么久
Not sure it works like that. Not after all this time.

88
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,070
不过那样会很奇怪吧？
How strange would that be, though?

89
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:16,200
她看着还是一九六二年那样
She'll look like she did in 1962.

90
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,950
而我已经成了这副样子
And I look like this.

91
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,300
这是怎么啦？
What is it?

92
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,470
呃 别生气 凯特
Er, don't be cross, Kate.

93
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,010
我要出去抽支烟
I'm going to have a smoke.

94
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,550
- 你还好吗？  - 嗯
- Are you all right?  - Fine.

95
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:20,090
把这个吃了 然后去吃药
Please eat this. And take your pills.

96
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,340
他们在信里问我是否想去瑞士
Th-They've asked if I want to go to Switzerland.

97
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,560
他们为什么问这个？
Why would they ask that?

98
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,730
嗯… 去确认尸体
Well, to see the body.

99
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,350
- 什么时候？  - 越快越好吧 我猜
- When?  - Soon, I suppose.

100
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,280
- 你不打算去吗？  - 不知道
- You aren't thinking of going?  - Don't know.

101
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,400
大老远去瑞士？
All the way to Switzerland?

102
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,820
也不是很远
It's not that far.

103
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,570
有从斯坦斯特德机场起飞的航班
There are flights from Stansted.

104
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,070
是 但也够远的了
Yeah, but it's far enough.

105
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,030
- 你觉得我不应该去？  - 说实话？
- You don't think I should?  - Honestly?

106
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,040
嗯 不应该去
Well, no.

107
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,080
我不知道去的意义何在
I don't see the point.

108
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,330
- 再说我们在周六还有派对  - 我又不是说现在就走
- Plus we've got the party on Saturday.  - I wasn't thinking of going now.

109
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,760
- 我不会现在就走的  - 是啊 但你一定会去
- I-I wouldn't go now.  - Yeah, but still.

110
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,880
我不赞成你去爬那该死的大雪山
I don't like the idea of you climbing a big bloody mountain.

111
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,210
嗯 我觉得不会要爬山的
Well, I don't think it would come to that.

112
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,550
你连跟我一起去布罗茨散步都不愿意
You don't like going for a walk with me on the Broads

113
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,030
那地方可是跟煎饼一样平
and that's as flat as a pancake.

114
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,760
我知道
I know.

115
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,310
我说啦 凯特 不会要爬山的
Like I said, Kate, it wouldn't come to that.

116
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,480
可还是…
But still...

117
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,070
- 你不是要去镇上吗？  - 哦 我可以再找时间去
- Don't you have to go into town?  - Oh, I can rearrange.

118
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,270
别 你还是快去吧
No, y-you should go.

119
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,200
这事有点令人震惊 但仅此而已
It's been a bit of a shock, that's all.

120
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,370
我没事儿
But I'm fine.

121
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,580
- 你确定吗？  - 是的 很好
- Are you sure?  - Yeah, positive.

122
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,330
看起来大不一样了 空荡荡的
Oh. It looks different, all empty.

123
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,870
桌子一般放在这儿
Well, this is where the tables are usually placed.

124
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,670
主桌在这里 好让所有人都看得到你
The top one over there, so that everyone can see you.

125
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,160
谢了 但我们不需要主桌
We won't be having a top table, but thank you.

126
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,370
真的？
Really?

127
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,960
在这样的场合一张主桌是极妙的
A top table is so lovely at an event like this.

128
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,340
你们俩就是全场焦点
The two of you as a focal point of the room.

129
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,420
我们并不是要再来一次婚礼
We're not trying to recreate the wedding.

130
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,220
就是个派对
It's just a party.

131
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,510
好吧 当然 随你心意
Yes, well, it's your choice, of course.

132
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:32,730
这地方棒极了 对周年纪念来说 绝对是个明智的选择
I will say, though, it's a wonderful place, location-wise, for an anniversary.

133
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,680
这是四十周年 是吧？
It's your 40th, isn't it?

134
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,980
四十五周年
45th.

135
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,150
这可是个不太寻常的庆祝节点
That's an unusual one to celebrate.

136
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,230
我丈夫当时生病取消了四十周年纪念 所以我们不得不改变计划
My husband was ill and our 40th was cancelled, so we had to rearrange.

137
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:49,030
那么 我必须得尽量把这次办得非常特别 对吧？
Well, I must try and make this one super-special, then, mustn't I?

138
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,450
这儿绝对是举行周年纪念的绝佳地点
And this really is a great venue for such an event.

139
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,130
充满历史气息 是吧？
So full of history, you see?

140
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,370
像历久弥新的婚姻
Like a good marriage.

Did you know that the Trafalgar Ball was held here?

142
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,970
知道 你的助手和我说了
Yes, your assistant told me.

143
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,970
那是一八〇五年
It was in 1805.

144
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,390
你能想象当时的场景有多么壮观吗？
Can you imagine how incredible that must have been?

纳尔逊不是被杀了吗？
Wasn't Nelson killed?

147
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,390
但是我们赢得了战役啊
But the battle was won.

148
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,410
非常值得庆贺 不是吗？
And that has to be worth celebrating, doesn't it?

149
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,370
我们的婚礼上有主桌 但是我们一点也不喜欢
We had a table at our wedding, a top table, but we didn't like it at all.

150

我丈夫认为这是腐朽的资产阶级糟粕
My husband thought it a horribly bourgeois tradition.

151

我们看看开胃菜菜单吧？
Shall we have a look at the canapé list?

00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,130
呃 好的 当然
Er, yes, indeed.

153

我马上回来
I'll be right back.

你把它修好了吗？
Did you manage to fix it?

161
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,000
我想它需要一个新的浮球阀
It needs a new ballcock, I think.

去买烟？
To buy cigarettes?

好吧 继续说
OK. Go on.

and she kept asking me if I was all right.

我说是的 但她不相信我
And when I said I was, she wouldn't believe me.

190
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,780
况且… 我什么也没做
And... l wasn't doing anything.

191
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:36,740
什么也没做 就是坐在鸭子池边的长凳上
Nothing. Just sitting on the bench by the duck pond,

- 我有些事想跟你说  - 说吧
- There's something I want to tell you.  - OK.

205
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,270
知道吗 我很确信我之前跟你说过了
You know, I-I feel sure I've told you before,

206
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:52,230
但那是很久之前了 所以 我有可能记错了
but it was a long time ago, so, I mean, I could be wrong.

- 嗯 说吧  - 好
- OK, go on.  - Yeah.

208
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,150
我算是她的直系亲属
Um, I-I was her next of kin.

209
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,660
什么意思？
What do you mean?

210
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,710
唔 从官方上来说
Well, officially.

211
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:12,040
我算是她的直系亲属 我确定之前和你说过的 凯特
I-I was her next of kin. I'm sure I told you this before, Kate.

212
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,170
我想我会记得我丈夫是另外一个女人的直系亲属这种事的
I think I would remember my husband being another woman's next of kin.

213

- 为什么？  - 什么为什么？
- Why?  - Why what?

214
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,720
为什么你算是她的直系亲属？
Well, why were you her next of kin?

215
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,100
因为他们觉得我们已经结婚了
Because they thought we were married.

216
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,350
- 谁？  - 官方 人们
- Who did?   - The authorities. People.

217
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,730
他们为什么会这么认为？
What made them think that?

218
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,900
我们跟他们是这么说的
We-We told them we were.

219
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,980
但你们没有 对吧？
You weren't, though?

220
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,560
噢 没没没 没有 当然没有
Oh, no, no, no. No, h-hell, no.

221
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,780
我们必须假装 这样别人才会让我们借住他们的房子
We just had to pretend, so people would let us stay in their houses.

222
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,060
那会儿和现在不一样 凯特 然后… 就是那场事故
Different in those days, Kate, and then after... the accident.

223
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,330
你没骗我？
You're not lying to me?

224
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,960
没有 凯特 她手上戴了一个戒指
No. Kate, she wore a ring on her finger.

225
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,790
小巧的木制戒指 像窗帘环一样 橡木制的
It was a small wooden ring, like a curtain ring, made of oak.

226
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,050
你还记得这些细节 真有意思
Funny you'd remember that.

227
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,220
那不算是真的
Well, it wasn't real.

228
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:18,230
好吧 你可以… 你可以早点告诉我的 杰夫
OK, you could've... you could've just told me, Geoff.

229
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,450
我以为我已经说过了
I thought I had.

230
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:28,000
如果我还没说 那么 这挺难的 呃…
If I hadn't, well, it's hardly, er...

231
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:31,240
把这种事告诉
the sort of thing you tell

232

你漂亮的新女友 不是吗？
your beautiful new girlfriend, is it?

233
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,510
我可不这么觉得
I suppose not.

234
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,350
我想我要… 上楼去然后洗个澡了
I think I'm going to have a... go upstairs and have a bath.

235
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,220
明天还有很多事要做呢
I've got lots to do tomorrow.

236
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,900
- 你确定你还好吗？  - 嗯 嗯
- Are you sure you're all right?   - Yes. Yes.

237
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,140
嗯 真的 挺好的
Yeah, really, I am.

238
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,650
我不能为咱们相遇之前发生的事生气 不是吗？
I can hardly be cross with something that happened before we existed, can I?

239
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,820
也不是这么说
Not really.

240
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,730
但是…
Still...

241
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,700
我想你现在都不愿意抱我了吧
I suppose a cuddle's out of the question.

242
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,300
我甚至觉得当时在那儿的根本不是我
It doesn't even feel like it was me that was there.

243
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,130
你明白我的意思吗？
Do you know what I mean?

244
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,840
你在那待了多久？
How long had you been up there?

245
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,640
六周还是七周吧 估计
Oh, six or seven weeks, I suppose.

246
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,810
或许更久
It seemed a lot longer.

247
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,270
我们出发时带了张地图
We had a map, er, to start with.

248
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,070
那玩意真他娘的不靠谱
It was so bloody unreliable.

249
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,950
不过我还是到了一个地方
I've still got it somewhere.

250
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,290
我们往山上更高的地方爬去
Yeah, we were getting higher into the mountains

251
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,210
我觉得最好得找个人
and I decided it would be best if we found someone,

252
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,000
你知道的 帮我们到意大利边境
y-you know, to help us get to the Italian border.

253
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,090
- 一个导游？  - 对 但不是真正的导游
- A guide?  - Yeah, wasn't really a guide.

- 你一直都特讨厌凯鲁亚克  - 是啊 没错
- You always did hate Kerouac.  - Yes, I did.

256
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,630
也许你就是嫉妒了
Maybe you were jealous.

257

- 什么 嫉妒杰克·凯鲁亚克？  - 嫉妒那个导游
- What, of Jack Kerouac?  - Of the guide.

Was he flirting with her?

我的德语 不那么好 带口音
My German, it wasn't that great, what with its accent.

261
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,400
他们常常笑话这个
They laughed a lot.

262
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,160
他永远只会开一些我不知道有什么好笑的玩笑
He was forever making these jokes I didn't get.

263
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,740
- 天呐 你可不喜欢这样  - 不 我不喜欢
- Oh, God, you wouldn't like that.  - No, I didn't.

264
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,760
他们一起在我前边走着 比必要的距离更往前
They were walking up ahead, more than they needed to perhaps,

265
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:28,010
或许… 我就随他们去了吧 我不知道
or... maybe I just let them, I don't know.

266
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:33,140
我们到了一个沿着岩石的小道
We were on a track round this rock,

267
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:38,430
冰川就在我们的右下方
and the glacier was on the right, below us.

268
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,150
我们沿路而下
Way down.

269
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,440
景色宜人
Beautiful thing, it was.

270
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,770
你会喜欢那儿的风景的 凯特
You'd love the landscape out there, Kate.

271
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,950
- 你真的会喜欢的  - 嗯 我相信
- You really would.  - Yeah, I'm sure.

272
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,370
他们离开了我的视线 走到了拐角处
They were out of sight, round the corner,

273
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:00,870
我最后听见的是她的笑声
and the last sound but one that I heard was her laughter.

274
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,880
天呐 这笑声真是让我恼火
And, Christ, did it annoy me.

275
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,130
但是不久 就传来了尖叫声
But then, there was a scream.

276
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,470
但这叫声并不响
It wasn't a loud scream, neither.

277
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,770
我估计是空气从她受到冲击的肺里倾泻而出
Sort of outpouring of air from her lungs from the shock, I suppose.

278
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:22,020
很低沉的喉音
It was low and guttural,

279
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:27,610
根本不像她的声音 柔软的 尖尖的
not like her voice, which was soft, higher-pitched.

280
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,410
天呐 太可怕了
God, that's just horrible.

281
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,070
嗯 嗯
Mm. Mm.

282
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,740
然后呢？
And then what?

283
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,700
就这样 无力回天
That was it, really.

284
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,830
等我到那里 她已经不见了
When I got there, she'd gone.

285
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,710
凯鲁亚克朝着那个洞望去
And Kerouac was looking down this hole.

286
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,960
一条裂缝
A fissure.

287
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,510
是的 裂缝 可以这么说 就像一块岩石从中间裂开
Yeah, a fissure, I suppose you'd call it, like a narrow, narrow crack in the rock.

288
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,880
你还记得在苏格兰那个吗？
D-Do you remember that one in Scotland?

289
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,350
- 嗯 我记得  - 对 就跟那个一样
- Yeah, I do.  - Yeah. Well, it was like that one.

290
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,270
- 嗯  - 只是深得多
- Yeah.  - Only much deeper.

291
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,820
凯鲁亚克就站在那里
And Kerouac was just standing there.

292
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:14,110
他的脸 扭曲发黄
His face, oddly enough, it looked almost yellow.

293
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,540
她是金发吗？
Was she blonde?

294
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,660
- 什么？  - 她有一头金发吗？
- Sorry?  - Did she have blonde hair?

295
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,460
噢 不 不 她是黑发
Oh, no, no. She had dark hair.

296
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,790
- 像我一样  - 嗯
- Like mine, then.  - Mm.

297
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,960
我是说 不是现在
I mean, not now.

298
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,590
是啊 像你一样
Yeah, like yours.

299
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,800
她当时多大？
How old was she?

300
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:42,480
她比我大两岁 当时是六二年
She was two years older than me, and that was '62.

301
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,550
嗯 那她当时大概二十七岁
Yeah, so she was about 27.

302
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,730
对
Yeah.

303
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,530
我妈妈是那年去世的
My mum died that year.

304
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,480
- 是吗？  - 是的 嗯
- Did she?  - Yeah. Mm.

305
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,610
- 我不知道为什么这很可笑但确实如此  - 可笑？
- I don't know why that's funny but it is.  - Funny?

306
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:59,820
唔 我们当时互相不认识 你和我
Well, we didn't know each other then, you and I,

307
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:04,080
但我们却同时经历着令人心碎的事 并且…
but we were both going through something really unpleasant, and...

308
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:08,410
我们相识了这么些年 还从没跟对方提起过
and yet we never talked about it in all the years that we've known each other.

309
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:11,960
- 从没  - 没有 从来没有
- Never.  - No. Never have.

310
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,190
我累了
I'm tired.

311
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,560
我要关灯吗？
Shall I turn off the light?

312
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,570
嗯
Yeah.

313
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,510
我也很累了
I'm quite tired, too.

314
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:06,370
星期二

315
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,740
过来
Come on.

316
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,740
麦克斯！
Max!

317
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,120
麦克斯！
Max!

318
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,670
孩子！过来！
Yeah, boy! Come on!

319
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,840
过来！乖孩子
Come on! Good boy.

320
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,450
你今天起得真早
You're up early this morning.

321
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:06,450
是啊 我想我可能和你一起去镇上 如果你不介意的话
Yeah, I thought I might come into town with you, if you don't mind.

322
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,700
不 当然不介意
No, of course I don't mind.

323
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:11,130
我想去买个新的浮球阀
Yeah, I-I want to go to Thorns, get a new ballcock.

324
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,290
好啊
Oh, good.

325
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:20,500
你觉得我的图书馆卡还能用吗 凯特？
Do you think my library card will still be valid, Kate?

326
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:24,640
- 没什么不能用的啊  - 如果有时间的话我想去那转转
- I don't see why not.   - I might pop in there if there's time.

327
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,810
随便看看
Have a bit of a browse.

328
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,940
- 我们再一起吃个午饭  - 对 真棒
- We could have some lunch.  - Yeah, great.

329
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:33,140
呃 我有些自己的事情要做
Well, er, I'll just go do what I have to do.

330
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,060
你准备走了叫我就行
Give us a shout when you're ready.

331
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,270
好的
OK.

332
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:39,770
大概过一小时 我要打电话给花店 还有一两件事情要做
About an hour. I've got to call the florist and one or two things.

333
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,540
你觉得图书馆会有气候变化方面的书吗？
Do you think the library will have anything on climate change?

334
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:07,210
- 什么方面？  - 气候变化
- On what?  - Climate change.

335
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,730
- 抱歉我迟到了  - 没事
- Sorry I'm late.  - All right.

336
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,780
- 东西买到了吗？  - 什么东西？
- Did you get the thing?  - What thing?

337
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,240
- 浮球阀  - 呃 他们得先订货
- The ballcock.  - Er, they have to order it.

338
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,410
我过几天再去取
I'll pick it up in a few days.

339
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,990
你要吃点什么？
What do you want to eat?

340
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,750
我们该对环境问题多一点思考
We've got to think a lot more about the environment.

341
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,210
- 嗯… 我们有循环利用啊  - 有吗？
- Well, we recycle.  - Do we?

342
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:46,170
- 有 嗯 我会尽量 至少  - 是应该这样
- Yeah. Well, I try to, anyway.  - Well, we should.

343
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:50,090
你要是能来打扫空狗罐头然后丢到对应的垃圾桶里去就再好不过了
You're welcome to clean out the dog cans and put them in the right bins.

344
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:54,260
那些冰川的融冰量远远超出了人们的预想
Because these glaciers, they're melting a lot more than people imagined,

345
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,640
- 冰川融水不会顺流而下  - 那总要流向哪吧
- and the water's just not coming down.  - It's got to go somewhere.

346
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,310
不 它们会浸透岩层 然后从岩层底部开始 不断往上积聚
No, it's saturating into the rock beneath, and it's building up and up and up.

347
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,520
- 就像…  - 就像大坝
- L-Like...  - Like a dam.

348
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,440
就像大坝 对 不断堆积 填充 增长  然后…
Like a dam, yeah. It's waiting, waiting, waiting, and then...

349
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,690
哦
Oh.

350
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,650
毫无预警地
No warning.

351
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,700
就像海啸一样倾覆而下 所经之处横扫一空
Come down like a tsunami, wipe out everything in its path.

352
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:21,200
学校 教堂 咖啡馆喝咖啡的人
Schools, churches, people in cafes drinking their coffee,

353
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:24,250
钟表店里修理布谷鸟钟的老头
old men in shops tinkering with their cuckoo clocks.

354
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:29,000
要不是他们发现了她的尸体 那么她就要到那时候才会
And if they hadn't found her, that's when she'd have come down,

355
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:31,460
和岩石残骸一起被冲下来
with all the rock and debris.

356
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,630
那时候我们早就死了多少年了
We'll be long dead by then.

357
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,760
哦
Oh.

358
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,140
把书收起来
Put your book away.

359
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,310
哦 对
Oh, yeah.

360
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:52,190
- 你屏蔽了我的电话吗 凯特？  - 并没有
- You screening my calls, Kate?  - Not really.

361
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,400
- 你好  - 你好
- Hello.  - Hi.

362
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,110
- 莎莉！  - 你好 杰夫
- Sally!  - Hi, Geoff.

363
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,160
那是我最喜欢的一张
That's my favourite one, there.

364
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,660
好了 妈 已经看够了 有点没意思了
OK, Mum. I think it's enough now. It's getting really boring.

365
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,950
- 我为我的孙子骄傲  - 莎莉 我想看查理的照片
- I'm proud of my grandson.  - Sally, I want to have a look at Charley.

366
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,960
这几张太可爱了
These are so lovely.

367
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,750
照片拍的真美
And the photos are really beautiful.

368
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,130
- 是吧？  - 莎莉要成为摄影师呢
- Aren't they?  - Sally's going to be a photographer.

369
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,010
才没有 我只是去上了晚课 纯粹图好玩
I'm not. I'm just taking an evening course, just for the fun of it.

370
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:15,170
不是什么了不得的事
It's nothing grand.

371
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,760
- 但没准会有点成就  - 也可能不会有
- But it might lead to something.  - Or it might not.

372
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,140
我们拭目以待吧 好吗？不过你得在这上面下功夫才行
We shall see, won't we? But you should concentrate on it.

373
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,350
我大概三月前开始练习它
I took it up about three months ago.

374
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:28,020
这种乐器很容易学习 你能用尤克里里弹任何曲子
It's a good instrument to learn. You can play anything on the ukulele.

375
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:33,150
[乔治·福姆比：英国演员，时常弹奏尤克里里(夏威夷四弦琴)]
不光是乔治·福姆比的曲子 这很好 你知道我一直都讨厌他
It's not just George Formby, which is good because, as you know, I always hated him.

376
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,440
互联网真是太神奇了
The Internet is absolutely brilliant.

377
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:38,660
如果你去找一个叫“贾斯汀吉他网”的小伙子的话
If you go to a guy called justinguitars. com,

378
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,120
他真的教吉他 不过完全免费
he actually teaches guitar, but it's all free.

379
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,620
他也开始 呃 教尤克里里了
He's started, er, teaching ukulele as well.

380
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,160
再见 玩得开心
See you later. Have a nice time.

381
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,870
好的 再见
All right, see you later.

382
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,630
我觉得… 我觉得杰夫不会想去酒吧的
I don't think... I don't think Geoff wanted to go to the pub.

383
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,710
他要么去酒吧 要么就得和我们一起购物
It's either that or he comes shopping with us.

384
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,460
我们应该都去酒吧的
We could have gone to the pub, all of us.

385
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,420
看看他白天喝酒是什么样子
Know what he's like with daytime drinking.

386
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,170
他会没事的
Oh, he'll be all right.

387
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,510
不管怎样 他有了发泄的机会
Anyway, it gives him a chance to vent.

388
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,350
- 发泄什么？  - 关于你
- About what?  - About you.

389
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,760
妈！
Mum!

390
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,680
也不是说关于你 不过跟派对有关
Not about you as such, but about the party.

391
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,980
你说他要发泄跟派对有关的事… 是什么意思？
What do you mean about... vent about the party?

392
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,770
我想起乔治在我们的四十周年纪念前有多糟糕
When I think how awful George was before our 40th,

393
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,650
我差点就跟他离婚了
I was that close to divorcing him.

394
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,070
别管她
Ignore her.

395
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:17,030
那么 你打算穿什么礼服？你喜欢什么样的？
So, what's going to happen with your dress? What would you like?

396
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:25,290
所以 我们不该办派对吗？
So, should I not be having a party?

397
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,080
当然要有
Of course you should.

398
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,960
我们两个都很有压力
It is a lot of pressure for both of us.

399
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,330
而且不管怎样我都讨厌派对 就算是在最好的日子
And I hate parties anyway, at the best of times.

400
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,630
我说 我都从来没有开派对庆祝过自己的生日
I mean, I never even celebrate my birthday.

401
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:36,090
不 不 不 不 不 你得开
No, no, no, no, no, you have to.

402
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,050
我说 怪就怪在这儿
I mean, that's the strange thing.

403
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:41,640
乔治是很糟糕 但你记得他到了派对上的样子吗？
George was awful, but then do you remember him at the actual party?

404
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,220
他哭的有多厉害？
How much he cried?

405
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,390
还不仅仅是在致辞的时候哭
And not only during the speeches.

406
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,270
是啊 他是个很动情的人
Yeah, he was very sweet.

407
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,940
这就是为什么派对这种事情很重要
That's why these things are important.

408
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,610
什么 为了让丈夫们哭吗？
What, to make our husbands cry?

409
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:56,980
不光是丈夫们 所有的男人
Not just husbands, all men.

410
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:58,620
他们总是最先被触动的人
It's always them that break first.

411
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,320
莎莉的婚礼 查理的洗礼
Sally's wedding, Charley's christening.

412
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:05,910
我们能一起操办起来 是因为我们早就知道这些事情的重要性
We hold it together 'cause we already know how important these things are.

413
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,250
杰夫可不是爱哭鬼
Geoff is not much of a crier.

414
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,420
我打赌他在婚礼上哭了
I bet he cried at your wedding.

415
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,380
我不记得了
I don't remember.

416
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,550
如果这是某种进化的关键
If it's some twist of evolution

417
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,100
让男人们把一门心思花在讣告和分配遗产上
that needs men to be obsessed by their obituaries, their legacies,

418
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:32,270
那么或许我们的任务就是去敦促他们认清真正重要的是什么
then maybe it's ours to nudge them into realising what's really important

419
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:36,110
在他们用失望把自己给弄死之前 你知道的
before they kill themselves, you know, with the disappointment.

420
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,750
- 早安  - 哦
- Morning.  - Oh.

421
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,960
我打了个瞌睡
I nodded off.

422
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,170
你觉得莎莉的照片拍得怎么样？
What did you think of Sally's photos?

423
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,130
- 嗯？  - 莎莉的照片
- Mm?  - Sally's photos.

424
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,880
我觉得她的审美很不错
I think she's got a very good eye.

425
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,970
哦 没错 是这样
Oh, sure. Yeah. Mm.

426
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,720
嗯
Mm.

427
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:12,140
我有时候觉得没在屋子四面多挂一些照片真是可惜了
I sometimes think it's a shame not to have more photos around the house.

428
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,520
我们可以挂几幅上去
We could put some up.

429
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,690
但我们没有照片 没什么可挂的
Yeah, but we don't have any. Not really.

430
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:21,360
我是说 没有莉娜那种可以做成展览墙的照片
I mean, not like Lena does with her wall display.

431
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:32,700
我想是因为他们有儿子和孙子 而且…
I suppose it's because they've got children and grandchildren, and...

432
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:39,380
我们觉得拍自己的照片没什么意思
I guess we didn't see the point of taking pictures of ourselves.

433
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,050
感觉有点虚荣
Would have been a bit vain.

434
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:46,010
你之前说 每个无时无刻不在拍照的人
You used to say that everybody taking pictures all the time

435
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,510
都是在妨碍所有人的所有乐趣
stopped anyone having any fun.

436
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,470
- 我说过吗？  - 你说过
- Did I?  - You did.

437
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,890
- 听起来像是我说的话  - 嗯哼
- Sounds like something I'd say.  - Mm-hm.

438
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,190
你之前有过一部相机
You had a camera, once.

439
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,270
- 对 一台雅西卡  - 嗯 一台雅西卡
- Yeah, a Yashica.  - Mm, a Yashica.

440
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,730
是啊 我还留着呢
Yeah, I've still got it.

441
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,900
放在阁楼
It's in the loft.

442
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,660
不过现在我们老了再来看 这… 这真是可惜
Now that we're older, though, it... it's a shame.

443
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,870
你想要什么样的照片？
What would you want photos of?

444
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:20,880
- 麦克斯还是小狗那会儿的  - 嗯哼
- Max when he was a pup.  - Mm-hm.

445
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,670
在他之前的特莎
Tessa before him.

446
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:29,600
你在装饰克利瑟罗的那间屋子时把钉子钉到你手上的
You when you were decorating Clitheroe and you hammered that nail into your hand.

447
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,100
你想要那种照片？
You want a photograph of that?

448
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,510
哦 你知道我指的是什么
Oh, you know what I mean.

449
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,600
那是我们的第一所房子
It was our first house.

450
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,770
是的
It was.

451
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:40,860
那是我离开家后的第一个家
Yeah, it was my first home since leaving home,

452
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,530
自从离开父母 离开我的父亲
since leaving my parents, leaving my father.

453
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:51,950
我想我们那时还没有意识到
I suppose we don't realise at the time

454
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,620
但那些回忆…
but those memories...

455
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,000
… 它们就是最珍贵的事情 不是吗
...they're the things, aren't they?

456
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,170
我想要一张你在利兹麦加的照片
I'd want a picture of you at the Leeds Mecca.

457
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,930
那是我们相遇的地方
That's where we met.

458
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,390
你那时迷人的要命
You were a bloody knockout.

459
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,430
噢 有点别扭 不是吗
Oh, it's odd, isn't it,

460
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,430
回忆我们的曾经？
thinking of us back then?

461
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:21,400
我那时二十岁都不到 而你那么酷 嘴边叼着香烟
I wasn't even 20, and you were so cool, with your cigarette hanging in your mouth.

462
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,020
嗯
Mm.

463
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,650
我跟你说
Tell you what.

464
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,860
- 你在做什么？  - 过来
- What are you doing?  - Come on.

465
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,620
- 我们可以跳起来…  - 噢 讨厌！
- We can move the...  - Oh, bugger off!

466
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,820
来吧
Come on.

467
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:36,450
我可不会这么晚还在客厅跳起舞来
I'm not prancing around in the living room at this time of night.

468
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,610
手举起来 对
Over the top, yeah.

469
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,550
我们再也不是二十岁啦
We ain't 20 any more.

470
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,680
不是喽
No.

471
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,850
我们上楼去吧
Let's go upstairs.

472
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,910
我们来吧
Come on with ya.

473
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,680
希望你能让我印象深刻
Hope I can remember what you do.

474
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:19,470
我会让你好看的
I'll show you.

475
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,810
- 你下边怎么样了？  - 我觉得我来状态了
- How are you doing down there?  - I think I'm ready.

476
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,020
是吗？
Yeah?

477
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,900
- 你不用我换到上面来吗？  - 不 我快进来了
- You don't want me to go on top?  - No, I'm nearly there.

478
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,780
哦 没错
Oh, you are, too.

479
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,910
进来了
Oh, there you go.

480
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,120
噢 真棒
Oh, yeah.

481
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,080
哦
Oh.

482
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:46,630
亲一个
A kiss.

483
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,720
睁开眼
Open your eyes.

484
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,850
- 呃…  - 妈的
- Uh...  - Oh, shit.

485
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,190
噢 坏了
Oh, bugger.

486
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,940
- 我想我去了  - 我…
- I think I've lost it.  - I...

487
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,530
没事 没事 没事
OK, OK, OK.

488
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:22,160
杰夫 没关系的 没关系的
Geoff, it's OK, it's OK.

489
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,960
嘿
Hey.

490
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,130
- 唔…  - 没关系的
- Aw...  - It's OK.

491
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,880
我们睡觉吧
No, let's just go to sleep.

492
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,130
杰夫？
Geoff?

493
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:56,250
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

494
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,510
- 杰夫？  - 我很好 凯特
- Geoff?  - I'm OK, Kate.

495
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,260
拜托快下来 这太胡闹了
Please come down. This is ridiculous.

496
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,430
我没事
I'm OK.

497
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,140
你手里拿着的是什么？
What's that in your hand?

498
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,890
没什么
Nothing.

499
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,060
- 是她吗？  - 我发现了这个
- Is it her?  - I found it.

500
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:16,270
你不是发现了 你是半夜跑上去找它
You didn't find it. You went looking for it in the middle of the night

501
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,110
这根本不是一回事
and that's not the same thing at all.

502
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,820
- 让我看看  - 不
- Let me see it.  - No.

503
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,280
求你了 杰夫 我能看看吗？
Please, Geoff. Can I see it?

504
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:25,620
拜托 凯特 回床上去
Please, Kate, just go back to bed.

505
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,790
给我看看那该死的照片！
Show me the bloody picture!

506
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,750
只是一张照片 仅此而已
It's just a picture. It's all it is.

507
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,540
这并不意味着什么 只是一张他妈的照片
It doesn't mean anything. It's just a fucking picture.

508
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,940
谢谢
Thanks.

509
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:09,320
星期三

510
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,670
麦克斯！
Max!

511
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,670
来吧！
Come on!

512
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:55,620
周六你会找人给你化妆吗？
Are you getting someone to do your makeup on Saturday?

513
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,790
我还没想过这事
I wasn't thinking of it.

514
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,000
我认识一个女孩 她手法很厉害
I know this girl. She's very subtle.

515
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:03,550
你不用担心化妆后看起来像妓女
You wouldn't have to worry about looking like a hooker.

516
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:11,430
莎莉有个很好用的按摩器 可以去黑眼圈
Sally's got this amazing roll-on thing, zaps away dark circles.

517
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,020
我想你可以借来用用
I'm sure you could borrow it.

518
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:17,480
如果我看起来很疲惫的话 你可以直接跟我说
If I'm looking tired, you can just tell me.

519
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,690
你看起来很疲惫
You're looking tired.

520
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,110
我很好
I'm fine.

521
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:28,030
啊 这破天气
Ugh, this weather.

522
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,580
我告诉你乔治怎么说的
I'm just telling you what George said.

523
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,500
我不是要扫你的兴 真的 不是
I'm not trying to upset you. Really, I'm not.

524
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,920
我没觉得扫兴 你还没告诉我呢
I'm not upset, but you're not telling me anything.

525
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,750
你刚刚说杰夫情绪有点反常
You're just saying that Geoff was in a strange mood.

526
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,920
乔治他就是这么说的
That's what George said.

527
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,380
杰夫说了什么吗？
Did Geoff say anything?

528
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,260
比如？
Like what?

529
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,050
这正是我要问你的
That's what I'm asking you.

530
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:53,560
- 和派对有关？  - 不 和派对没关系
- About the party?  - No, not about the party.

531
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,020
他们在讨论政治
They were talking politics.

532
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,140
就这些？
That's it?

533
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,980
他有些咄咄逼人
Well, he was very aggressive.

534
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,690
唔 我想乔治能够替自己说话的
Well, I'm sure George can stand up for himself.

535
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,820
他表现得和之前一样
He was acting like he used to.

536
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,990
什么意思？
Meaning?

537
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,820
就像那次他在我生日上当着我所有朋友的面
Like that time he kept accusing me of being a fascist

538
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:11,990
一直指责我是法西斯主义者一样
in front of all my friends at my birthday

539
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:15,910
就因为我敢说撒切尔执政还不算太糟糕
just because I dared to say that Thatcher hadn't done such a bad job of it.

540
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,080
我说 我甚至都没投过她的票
I mean, I hadn't even voted for her.

541
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,580
这可不好玩 凯特
It wasn't funny, Kate.

542
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:22,210
不
No.

543
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:24,590
非常让人难堪
Very upsetting.

544
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,760
他还不停地行纳粹礼
He kept doing a Nazi salute.

545
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:33,050
好吧 这是有点好笑了
All right, it was a little bit funny.

546
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,180
哦 对不起
Oh, I'm sorry.

547
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:40,100
我不应该提起这回事的
I shouldn't have brought it up.

548
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,560
你知道杰夫是什么样子
You know what Geoff's like.

549
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:45,230
他对有些事情太过狂热了
He gets over-passionate about things.

550
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,780
我想这就是你爱上他的原因
I suppose that's why you fell in love with him.

551
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,820
是啊
Yes.

552
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:06,000
哦 还有另外一件事
Oh, er, there's another thing.

553
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:07,550
什么？
What?

554
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:11,090
杰夫说他不确定他会想去工作午餐
Geoff says he's not sure that he wants to go to the works lunch.

555
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,430
克劳利家的吗？
At Crawley's?

556
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:14,220
- 可就在明天了  - 我知道
- But it's tomorrow.  - I know.

557
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:15,850
而且这次聚会很早就开始准备了
And it's been organised for so long.

558
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:19,020
乔治还期待着要把老朋友们都叫到一起来 但如果…
George was looking forward to getting the old gang together but if...

559
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,640
那他说为什么了吗？
Well, did he say why?

560
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:22,810
没有说
Don't think so.

561
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,150
我去跟他说
I'll speak to him.

562
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,820
呃 也许这没什么大不了的
Er, maybe it doesn't matter.

563
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,990
不 我去跟他说
No, I'll speak to him.

564
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:43,330
女士们…
Ladies...

565
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:45,960
倒满吗？
Full, full?

566
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,170
还要加点牛奶吗？
Do you want more milk?

567
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:52,840
好的
Yes.

568
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:55,260
来点饼干？不要了吗？
Biscuit? No?

569
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:58,600
不要？
No?

570
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,140
那我把饼干放这儿 我自己要拿一块吃
Well, I'll leave them there. And I'll take one.

571
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:02,770
- 谢谢你  - 在这之后
- Thank you.  - After that,

572
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:05,980
商人们通过这条新开辟的航线进行生意往来
the merchants used these newly created waterways,

573
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:10,110
航道被逐年加深拓宽
and over the years they were cut deeper and wider,

574
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:12,780
这就是为什么布罗茨会成为今天的面貌
and this is why the Broads are as they are today

575
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,610
供大家欣赏
for all of you to enjoy.

576
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:20,200
试想一下如果罗马人在别处发现了泥炭
Now, just imagine if those Romans had found peat elsewhere

577
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:23,790
或是决定在国土上的其它地方开挖泥炭
or chosen to dig in another part of the country.

578
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:25,960
那这些航道也就不会存在了
Then these broads wouldn't be here at all.

579
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,560
那是杰夫吗？
Is that Geoff?

580
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:08,600
是的 是他
Yes, it is, yeah.

581
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:10,770
他在做什么？
What's he doing?

582
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:12,980
他又抽烟了吗？
Is he smoking again?

583
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:15,190
看上去是
Looks like it.

584
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:21,240
在派对那天之前你该让他把胡子刮了
You should get him to shave before the big day too.

585
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,310
- 你好 杰夫里  - 你好 莉娜
- Hello, Geoffrey.  - Hello, Lena.

586
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:48,020
希望你已经准备好你的致辞了
Hope you've got your speech prepared.

587
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,900
我想在星期六听到你赞美凯特的话
I want to hear nice things about Kate on Saturday.

588
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:01,570
我听说你不想去克劳利家吃午餐
So, I hear you don't want to go to the Crawley's lunch.

589
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:07,080
你不去没关系 但我想知道原因
I don't mind if you don't, but I wondered why.

590
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,250
我就是不想去
I just don't.

591
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:12,330
你一直都很期待和大家再次碰面啊
You've been looking forward to seeing everyone again.

592
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,380
这件事你都念叨好几个星期了
You've been talking about it for weeks.

593
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:18,670
- 为什么不想去了？  - 我有我的原因
- Why don't you want to go?  - I've got me reasons.

594
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,970
什么原因？
Which are?

595
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:22,550
我去不去跟你有什么关系？
Why does it matter to you if I go or not?

596
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,390
和我没关系 但都已经安排好了
It doesn't, but it's been arranged.

597
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:25,560
所以呢？
So?

598
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:30,560
所以你不能言而无信 仅仅因为你不想去做
So you can't just back out of things simply because you don't feel like it.

599
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,730
即使你有你的原因
Even when you have reasons.

600
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:41,320
乔治他也会很不开心的
And George will be very upset.

601
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:44,740
他… 他好几周前就开始计划这次聚会了
He's... well, he's been organising it for weeks.

602
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:46,910
- 他是你的朋友  - 喔 好吧
- And he's your friend.  - Oh, fine.

603
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:50,660
- 那你会去吗？  - 我就是那么说的 不是吗？
- Then you'll go?  - Well, that's what I said, didn't I?

604
00:48:56,670 --> 00:49:02,090
有些天 我们完全忘掉了去意大利事 停滞不前
Some days, we forgot all about getting to Italy. Just stayed put.

605
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:04,220
我们变得漫不经心
We were being heedless.

606
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,890
这是我能找到的最合适的词
I think that's the word I'm looking for.

607
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:08,180
漫不经心？
Heedless?

608
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:10,350
漫不经心
Heedless.

609
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,940
在她的家乡 柏林墙正被筑起
Back in her Berlin, the Wall was going up

610
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:16,480
[猪湾事件：美国阴谋以武力支持古巴流亡者颠覆古巴革命政权]
而在美国刚发生了猪湾事件
and in America we'd just had the Bay of Pigs.

611
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:22,030
但那会儿 我们根本不管那些
But up there, we weren't thinking about all that.

612
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:25,490
也不去想我们的未来
Weren't thinking about our future.

613
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:28,700
但与此同时 我们也根本没有漫不经心
But, at the same time, we weren't heedless at all.

614
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:31,660
你怎么可能漫不经心？当你清楚自己的目标时
How can you be when, when you know what your purpose is?

615
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:34,920
当每一天似乎都有着某种意义时
When every day seems to have some point to it.

616
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,340
寻找安顿之处 寻找食物
Finding somewhere to stay, finding food.

617
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:40,510
那些日子里我们哪儿都没去
And the days we didn't go anywhere,

618
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:42,090
但它们就是好像充满了目标
they seemed just as purposeful

619
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:47,470
就像在该死的清晨四点雄赳赳地启程那样
as when we set out in complete seriousness at four in the fucking morning.

620
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:54,560
我想 嗯… 我想衰老最可怕的地方莫过于
I-I think, um... I think that's the worst part of getting decrepit,

621
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:58,270
失去那种… 目的性
losing that... purposefulness.

622
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:04,530
今天我想起了我们之前看到过的那些花儿
I-I was remembering today how we used to see these flowers.

623
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,740
紫罗兰的一种吧 我想是的
Some sort of violet, I think they were.

624
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:13,200
它们会找到一小块雪融掉的草地
They'd find a patch of grass where the snow had melted

625
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:15,370
然后就茁壮成长
and they'd just spring up.

626
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:19,840
我知道它们只是花朵 但它们看上去那么坚定
I know they were only flowers, but they seemed so determined.

627
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,000
甚至可以说 勇敢
Brave, even.

628
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,590
我觉得卡佳和我就是那样
And that's how I see Katya and me.

629
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:31,510
游走四方 摒弃现代文明
Wandering around, turning our backs on civilization.

630
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:34,020
勇敢？
Brave?

631
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,190
可以这么说
In a way.

632
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,230
你不觉得吗？
Don't you think?

633
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:39,810
并不
Not really.

634
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,860
为什么不？
Why not?

635
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,400
我说 你们究竟在干什么？
I mean, what were you actually doing?

636
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:47,150
你们只是在爬某座该死的山罢了
You're just climbing up some bloody mountain.

637
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:51,620
当然 我不是说我们这么做是出于勇敢
Well, I'm not saying what we did was out of bravery.

638
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:58,170
我觉得 你只是在追一个想要被追的女孩而已
I think you were just chasing a girl who wanted to be chased.

639
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,680
你不了解她
You didn't know her.

640
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:10,510
是
No.

641
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:13,260
我不了解
I didn't.

642
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:17,480
我累了
I'm tired

643
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:21,400
睡之前我想问你个问题
I want to ask you something before we go to sleep.

644
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,570
什么问题？
What's that?

645
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:32,120
如果她没死 如果你们到了意大利
If she hadn't died, if you had got to Italy,

646
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,330
那你会真的娶她吗？
would you have married her for real?

647
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:38,910
但我们没能到意大利 不是吗？
But we didn't get to Italy, did we?

648
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,460
而且她确实死了
And she did die.

649
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:42,460
嗯 但是如果呢
Yeah, but if you had.

650
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:46,800
我以为你不喜欢这种假设的问题
I thought you didn't like theoretical questions.

651
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,920
只管回答我
Just answer me.

652
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,840
是的
Yes.

653
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:59,140
是 你就会娶她？
Yes, you would have married her?

654
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:01,060
是的
Yes.

655
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:04,400
我就会娶她 她就会嫁给我
We would have married each other.

656
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:20,290
我觉得我再也没法谈论她的事了
I don't think I can talk about her any more.

657
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:26,340

689
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:52,270
真他妈没完没了
Fucking endless.

01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:56,280
你他妈肯定不会相信 他们对那地方做了什么
You wouldn't fucking believe what they've done to the place.

I tell you, if I was still in management, I wouldn't have let that happen.

还有工会 他们屁都不放一个
And the unions, they don't give a shit.

695
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:11,630
当然 也许他们放了 但没人在意
Well, maybe they do and nobody takes any notice.

下午好 您现在有空吗？
Good afternoon, love. Spare a couple of minutes?

712
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,150
我想向您介绍一下我们正在做的这个慈善项目
I'd love to tell you a bit about this charity we've got going on.

713
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,860
呃 我不感兴趣
Um, I'm not interested.

714
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:32,360

No? No problem.

715
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,100

- Is there somewhere you have in mind?  - No, I...

718
01:10:10,150 --> 01:10:13,030
我想问下有没有一个男人来过这里
I want to know if a man has been in here.

719

他是我丈夫
It's my husband.

720
01:10:14,950 --> 01:10:18,070
我们向你咨询过几次 我想知道他有没有来过
We've used you a few times and I wondered if he'd been in.

721
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:21,330
他是不是在问去瑞士的事？
Um, was he enquiring about Switzerland?

722
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:57,260
- 这么晚啊   - 是的 抱歉

726
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:09,770

727
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:13,360
你准备去瑞士吗？
Are you going to Switzerland?

728
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:18,820
- 不 不是   - 为什么？
- No. I'm not.  - Why not?

729
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:22,660
要是不走一会儿歇一会儿我连… 我连去村里都走不到
Well, I can't walk to the village without... without sitting down.

730
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:24,870
我要怎么爬一座他妈的山啊？
How am I going to climb a fucking mountain?

731
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:26,290
那就是你不去的理由吗？
And that's the reason?

732
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:27,910
不 凯特 不是因为那个
No, Kate, that's not the reason.

733
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,870
因为如果你真的要去 而我…
Because if you do go, and if I...

734
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:32,540
噢 天呐 凯特 这跟卡佳没关系
Oh, Christ, Kate. This isn't about Katya.

735
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:34,710
请别再说她的名字了
Please, stop saying her name.

736
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,300
- 我受不了  - 这跟… 这跟卡佳没关系
- I can't bear it.  - It isn't... It isn't about Katya.

737
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:38,550
有关系
It is.

738
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:40,720
当然有关系
Of course it is.

739
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:44,390
就像我发现了充斥着这栋房子的气味到底是什么一样
Like me discovering what this smell is around the house.

740
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:46,930
- 别这样  - 她的香水味 是吧？
- Oh, please.  - And it's her perfume, OK?

741
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:51,020
好像她这会儿就站在屋子角一样
It's like she's been standing in the corner of the room all this time,

742
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,190
- 就站在我身后  - 噢 别这样
- behind my back.  - Oh, come on.

743
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:57,480
这味道污染了所有东西
And it's tainted everything.

744
01:12:57,570 --> 01:13:01,240
我们所有的决定 去哪里度假 读什么书
All our decisions, where we go on holiday, what books we read,

745
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:04,450
养哪种狗 听什么歌
what dog you want to choose, what music we want to listen to.

746
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,910
在那些大事上也一样
And the big things, too.

747
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:09,080
尤其是那些大事
Especially the big things.

748
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:13,120
她跟那一切都没有任何关系
She's had nothing to do with any of that.

749
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:20,420
我倒是想告诉你我正在想的… 所有事情
I'd like to be able to tell you everything I'm... thinking,

750
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,590
和我知道的所有事情
and everything I know,

751
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:25,760
但我做不到
but I can't.

752
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:28,260
这你能理解吗？
Do you understand that?

753
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:31,230
嗯
Yeah.

754
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:33,440
是的 我理解
Yes, I do.

755
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:51,500
现在我只希望 你能来明天的聚会
All I want now is for you to just come to the party tomorrow.

756
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:54,500
- 我当然会来的  - 我真的需要你发自内心地想去
- Of course I'm going to come.  - I really need you to want to be there.

757
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:56,540
是的 我是真的想去那儿
Yes, I do want to be there.

758
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,840
因为我一个人明白我一直都无法让你满足
Because it's one thing me knowing I haven't been enough for you.

759
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,010
和…
It's something...

760
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:06,470
… 让其他人也都察觉到这一点 就完全不一样了
...altogether different that everyone else feels it, too.

761
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:09,350
你真的认为你无法让我满足吗？
You really believe you haven't been enough for me?

762
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:11,520
不 我认为我足以让你满足了
No. I think I was enough for you.

763
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,560
我只是不确定你怎么想
I'm just not sure you do.

764
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:18,900
啊 凯特
Ah, Kate.

765
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:22,110
那可真糟糕
That's terrible.

766
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:27,370
- 今天吃药了吗？  - 没有
- Have you taken your pills today?  - No.

767
01:14:27,450 --> 01:14:29,910
那我去拿来
Then I'm going to get them.

768
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:33,870
然后我们吃晚饭 然后我们上床睡觉
And then we're going to have dinner, and then we're going to go to bed.

769
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:36,670
然后我们准备起床
And then we're going to get up

770
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:40,250
然后我们重新来过
And we'll try and start again.

771
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:43,260
没问题 凯特 我能做到的
OK, Kate, I can do that.

772
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:47,300
我们能做到的
We can do that.

773
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,420
我保证
I promise.

774
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:56,520

777
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:15,750
- 噢  - 还有 呃…
- Oh.  - And, er. .

778
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:19,460
我把厕所给修好了 还没有切掉手指
I've managed to fix the lavatory without cutting me finger off.

779
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:23,340
现在是不是有点晚了？
Is it late?

780
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:25,670
是的 我在想着要炒个蛋
Y-Yeah, I thought I'd make us some scrambled eggs

781
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,840
然后我们带麦克斯出去走走
and then we can take Max for a walk.

782
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:31,510
- 好极了  - 是的

我们还有鸡蛋呢 是吧？
Yeah, we have got some eggs, haven't we?

785
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:03,630
我在这看到过一只旋木雀 可爱的小家伙
I saw a treecreeper here, once, a lovely little bird.

786
01:16:03,710 --> 01:16:09,130
有人告诉我 它们先飞到树底部 然后爬上去觅食
Somebody told me that they fly down to the bottom of the tree and work their way up.

787
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:14,100
而五子雀呢 它们先飞到顶上 然后再爬下来
And nuthatches, they fly to the top of the trunk, work their way down.

788
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:16,390
乖 乖 好孩子
Come on. Come on. Good boy.

789
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,730
- 你以前很喜欢观察鸟类  - 是啊 没错
- You used to love your birdwatching.  - I did, yes.

790
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:23,020
可笑的是你都忘记这些给你带来快乐的事了
It's funny how you forget the things in life that make you happy.

791
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:26,190
在这呆好 麦克斯
Stay there, Max.

792
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:52,260
我找到了 麦克斯
Found it, Max.

793
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:25,060
抱歉 这次我又没给你买任何东西
Again, I'm sorry I didn't get you anything.

794
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:27,220
噢 别犯傻了
Oh, don't be silly.

795
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:28,770
这项链很漂亮
This is very beautiful.

796
01:20:28,850 --> 01:20:30,940
我很高兴你喜欢
I'm glad you like it.

797
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:33,690
我想过要给你买块表
I was going to get you a watch.

798
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:37,650
我还想在上面刻字 可是不知道该写什么
I was thinking of having it engraved, but I wasn't sure what to write.

799
01:20:38,990 --> 01:20:41,070
我喜欢不知道时间的感觉
I like not knowing the time.

800
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:25,450
- 我就是做不到  - 是的
- I just couldn't do it.  - No.

801
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:29,120
- 别担心 亲爱的 不一定非要做  - 大多数人都不想的
- Don't worry, darling, you don't have to.  - Most people don't want to.

802
01:22:05,570 --> 01:22:08,030
跟我来下好吗？我有东西给你看
Will you come with me? I've got something to show you.

803
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:11,250
不要惊喜 莉娜 我不想要惊喜
No surprises, Lena. I don't want a surprise.

804
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:17,330
- 哇  - 是不是棒极了？
- Wow.  - Isn't it wonderful?

805
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:19,460
看看这 是的
Look at this. Yes.

806
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:22,420
- 莉娜 那是什么？  - 过来看看吧
- Lena, what's that?  - Ah, come and have a look.

807
01:22:25,090 --> 01:22:26,550
哇
Wow.

808
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:28,720
是照片
Photos.

809
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:32,140
- 都是从谁那儿弄来的？  - 我到处打电话 每个人都贡献了一些
- Where did they all come from?  - I rang round. Everyone contributed.

810
01:22:32,230 --> 01:22:33,680
大多是我的
Most of them are mine.

811
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:36,150
看呐 凯特 看看你多美
Look, Kate, look how beautiful you are.

812
01:22:36,230 --> 01:22:39,900
凯特 这是特莎还是只小狗的时候
Kate, there's Tessa when she was a puppy.

813
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:43,740
啊 那是我… 带着护目镜 在割草
Ah, there's me... me and me goggles, strimming.

814
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:44,950
割草呢
Strimming.

815
01:22:45,030 --> 01:22:47,360
- 看看这里的我们 还记得吗？  - 埃及
- Look at us there. Remember that?  - Egypt.

816
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:48,820
是的 我们去埃及的时候
Yeah, when we went to Egypt.

817
01:22:48,910 --> 01:22:50,950
真漂亮 咱俩
Gorgeous, we both are.

818
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,540
莉娜 这真是棒极了 谢谢你
Lena, this is wonderful. Thank you.

819
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:55,330
对一个老法西斯来说还不赖 哈？
Not bad for an old fascist, huh?

820
01:22:55,420 --> 01:22:57,500
简直棒极了
Yeah, not bad at all.

821
01:22:58,250 --> 01:23:01,050
- 我等不及要听你的演讲了  - 都记在这呢
- Oh, I can't wait to hear your speech.  - Yeah, it's all in here.

822
01:23:01,130 --> 01:23:04,170
- 那大家可都有麻烦了  - 是啊 尤其是你
- Ugh, we're all in trouble then.  - Yeah, especially you.

823
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:05,880
你就等着看他哭鼻子吧
Just you wait for those tears.

824
01:23:05,970 --> 01:23:07,970
- 那是谁？  - 我想是亚瑟
- Who's that?  - That's Arthur, I think.

825
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:09,260
- 是的 就是他  - 是的

827
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:43,670
女士们 先生们 下面是大家共同期盼的时刻
Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for.

828
01:23:44,210 --> 01:23:47,170
有请… 杰弗里·梅瑟先生
I give you... Mr Geoffrey Mercer.

829
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:48,720

830
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,350
能听见我吗？
Now, can you hear me?

831
01:23:56,430 --> 01:23:58,520
- 能听见  - 是的
- We can hear you.  - Yes.

832
01:23:59,150 --> 01:24:00,980
噢 乖乖
Oh, dear.

833
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:03,440
那我得试着好好讲话了
I'd better try and make sense, then.

834
01:24:03,530 --> 01:24:08,900
好吧 首先 我想感谢大家 来到今晚的聚会
Well, I'd like to thank you all, first off, for being here this evening.

835
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:14,030
你们也许还记得 几年前 呃… 我的心脏搭桥手术
Some of you may recall that, er... my bypass,

836
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:19,870
呃 在几年前抢尽了风头 嗯 总之就是这样
er, upstaged things a few years ago, so, anyway, there we are.

837
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:25,590
现在 我不太习惯做这样的发言
Now, er, I-I'm not used to making this kind of speech

838
01:24:25,670 --> 01:24:28,380
在 呃… 这样的场合
on this, er... sort of occasion,

839
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:30,930
但是… 总之…
but, er... well...

840
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:34,220
我会尽力的
I-I'll give it me best shot.

841
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,980
随着 嗯 随着我们变老
A-As, um, as we get older,

842
01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:44,520
我们好像不再 呃 做出选择
we seem to stop, er, making choices.

843
01:24:44,610 --> 01:24:46,730
至少 呃 不再做出重大的选择
Big ones, er, anyway.

844
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:49,950
也许我们一生中面临的选择 呃 只有那么多
Perhaps we only get so many, er, in a lifetime,

845
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:54,120
一旦我们用尽 呃 它们就不再有了
and once we've used them up, er, they're gone.

846
01:24:54,620 --> 01:25:00,540
又或许是我们的大脑 也变老了 呃 还患上了关节炎
Or maybe our brains, they just get a bit, er, old and arthritic,

847
01:25:00,620 --> 01:25:03,040
就像… 就像乔治的膝盖一样
like, er... like George's knee.

848
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:06,800
呃 不论如何
Er, whatever.

849
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:14,180
结果就是 我们年轻的时候做出的那些选择
The upshot is that the choices we make when we're young

850
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:18,180
都相当非常重要
are pretty bloody important.

851
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:24,650
呃 就像… 就像我跟凯特 所做出的这个选择
Er, like... like the choice, er, Kate and me made

852
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:28,820
在四十五年前的… 今天
45 years ago... today.

853
01:25:30,530 --> 01:25:32,610
今天
Today.

854
01:25:36,790 --> 01:25:42,160
现在 生活… 生活并不总是 嗯… 一帆风顺
Now, things... things haven't always been, er... idyllic.

855
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:48,250
呃 就像所有的夫妻一样 我们也经历过低谷 呃… 也经历过高峰
Er, like all couples, we've had our downs as, er... as well as our ups.

856
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:51,470
我们所有人 我们所有人 都认为…
We all, we all, er, think...

857
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:55,180
我们都希望我们在某些事情上所做的是另一种选择
W-We all wish we'd done some things, er, differently,

858
01:25:55,470 --> 01:25:59,220
希望我们未曾犯下某些错误
wish we hadn't made certain mistakes,

859
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:03,520
但是… 随便了
but, er... whatever.

860
01:26:04,650 --> 01:26:08,400
我不得不说 我也必须说
I have to say, and I need to say,

861
01:26:09,610 --> 01:26:16,370
说服你 嫁给我 凯特
that persuading you, er, to marry me, er, Kate,

862
01:26:16,450 --> 01:26:19,030
是我做过的最棒的事
was the best thing I've ever done.

863
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:22,290
嗯 顺便一提 我还真花了点功夫
Er, it took some doing, by the way.

864
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:24,960
是的 你父亲 我觉得他有点不中意
Yeah, so your father, I-I don't think he was convinced

865
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,130
认为我不是你最理想的对象
I was the greatest catch in the world.

866
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:30,130
我很好奇为什么不是
I wonder why that was.

867
01:26:30,210 --> 01:26:33,760
不过总之 呃 说服你嫁给我
But anyway, er, persuading you to marry me

868
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:37,640
是我做过的最棒的事了
was the best thing I've ever done,

869
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:42,310
还有 我很抱歉 真的很抱歉
and, er, I'm sorry, I-I truly am,

870
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:47,440
就是 你并不… 你并不总是知道
that, er, you haven't, er... you haven't always known that

871
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:50,900
因为 嗯 对我来说 凯特
because, er, well, for me, Kate,

872
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:56,490
这就是 这就是关于… 关于一切 关于所有的这些
this is, er, this is what it's... what it's all about, what all this is about,

873
01:26:56,570 --> 01:27:00,160
为什么所有… 为什么所有朋友们今晚都来到了这里
why all... why all our friends are here this evening.

874
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:03,790
那就是 嗯… 因为你和我
It's about, er... it's about you and me.

875
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:07,540
你和我 凯特
You and me, Kate.

876
01:27:07,630 --> 01:27:09,460
我们
Us.

877
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:11,250
是的
Yeah.

878
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:15,130
我觉得 老实说… 这就是所有… 我要说的话
And I think, really, that's about all I've, er... got to say

879
01:27:15,220 --> 01:27:18,300
还有这个… 我爱你
except that, er... l love you.

880
01:27:24,770 --> 01:27:26,140
我真的很爱你
I love you very much.

881
01:27:26,230 --> 01:27:30,480
谢谢你这么多年来陪伴在我身边
And thank you for standing by me through all these years

882
01:27:30,570 --> 01:27:35,240
忍受我的胡闹 还有… 希望我们能天长地久
and putting up with all my nonsense, and, er... long may it continue.

883
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:44,120
敬杰夫和凯特！
Geoff and Kate!

884
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,290
杰夫和凯特！

885
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:57,260
他的发言棒极了 不是吗？
It was fantastic. Wasn't it?

886
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:59,430
真的
It was.

887
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:21,660
现在…
And now...

888
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:26,330
两位爱人请上前来 跳第一只舞吧？
...would the two lovebirds kindly take to the floor for the first dance?

889
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:31,790
在座有谁不知道 或者那时尚未出生的诸位
And for those of you that don't know, or weren't alive,

890
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:37,130
这首歌正是四十五年前的今天放的那首歌
