不要嚼口香糖，把它吐掉
No chewing gum. Get rid of it.

72
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,880
别吐到我地板上
And not on my floor.

73
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,480
你，手臂放下来
You, arm down.

74
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,710

六公分[毫米/厘米]
Six millimeter.

76
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,430
真糟糕
Terrible.

77
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,490
腿再向前一点怎么样？
How about the leg a little further forward?

78
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,400
把头抬起来

Stripes, let the dress just fall down. Keep the stripes straight.

Smile.

93
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,330
天哪
God.

94
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,100
我要你们微笑啊
l asked you to smile.

95
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,600
怎么回事啊？
what's the matter?

96
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,650
你们忘了怎么笑了吗？
Have you forgotten what a smile is?

97
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,710
嘿？！
Hey?!

98
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:38,220
好吧，你们都累了，休息一下吧
All right, you're all tired now. Go on, relax.

99
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,260
我看不到你们的眼珠了，它们都眯起来了
l can't see your eyeballs anymore. They're just slits.

100
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,920
来吧
Go on.

101
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,570
把眼睛闭上
Close your eyes.

102
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,300
把眼睛闭上
Close your eyes.

103
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,880
就这样
And stay like that.

104
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,280
这对你们有好处
lt's good for you.

105
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,970
把眼睛闭上
Close your eyes.

106
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,910
这一定有五六年了
That must be five or six years old.

107
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,720
我拍的时候，它们对我一点意义都没有，只有麻烦
They don't mean anything when l do them. Just a mess.

108
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:24,700
之后，我发现有些东西还是有点意思的…
Afterwards, l find something to hang on to, like that--

109
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,300
比如说这腿
Quite like that leg.

110
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:35,480
然后它自己显现出来了合情合理
Then it sorts itself out and adds up.

111
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,210
这就像是侦探故事里找到了线索一样
lt's like finding a clue in a detective story.

112
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,250
别问我这个，我还不知道
Don't ask me about this one. l don't know yet.

113
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,520
- 我能买它吗？ - 不行
- Can l buy it?  - No.

114
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,460
你把它给我吗？
will you give it to me?

115
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,600
来
There.

116
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,870
紧绷着脸的混蛋
Tight-faced bastard.

117
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:45,510
一幅破画都不愿卖给我
He won't float me one of his crappy paintings.

118
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,790
哪天晚上，我摸进来把它偷走
l'll creep down one night and knock it off.

119
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,570
不要停，真舒服
Don't stop, it's lovely.

120
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,370
你看起来很累
You look tired.

121
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,770
我整个晚上都在集体宿舍里
l've been all night in a doss house.

122
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,680
她们说有人找她们来的
They say they've been asked to come here.

123
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:01,950
- 不是我  - 事实上没人找我们来
- Not by me.  - well, we weren't exactly asked.

124
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,270
抱歉，我很忙
Sorry, l'm busy.

125
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:08,930
他们在楼上帮我洗一些照片，去给我拿下来
They're printing some snaps for me upstairs. Go and fetch them.

126
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,570
不能给我们几分钟吗？
Couldn't you give us just a couple of minutes?

127
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,400
几分钟？
A couple of minutes?

128
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,210
我连割盲肠的时间都没有
l haven't even got a couple of minutes to have my appendix out.

129
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,350
- 那我们可以再来吗？ - 不能
- well, when can we come then?  - Don't.

130
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:02,780
- 其他人还闭着眼睛等着？ - 是的，但是眼睛睁开了
- The others still waiting with their eyes shut?  - Yes, they're waiting, but their eyes are open.

131
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,680
很好
Good.

132
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,480
叫她们再把眼睛闭上
Tell them to shut them again.

133
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:20,710
把那包扔掉，糟糕透了
Get rid of that bag. lt's diabolical.

134
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,740
我们今天下午还可以再来吗？
Can we come back this afternoon?

135
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:18,750
- 你要什么？ - 随便看看
- what do you want?  - Just looking around.

136
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,220
这里没有使宜货，你在浪费时间
There are no cheap bargains here. You're wasting your time.

137
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,560
噢，我只是随便看看
well, l'll just have a look.

138
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,360

谁说我不能？

149
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,620
我只是在工作，有些人是斗牛士，

150
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,760

我是摄影师

You know, most girls would pay me to photograph them.

155
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,210
我给你钱

156
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,850
我要价很高的

157
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:57,850
胶卷上有我想要的其他东西
There are other things l want on the reel.

158
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,700
那我们怎么办？
what do we do then?

159
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,760
我把照片给你送去
l send you the photographs.

160
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,170
不，我现在就要

不！
No!

162
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,540
这么猴急干什么？
what's the rush?

163
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,450
别把事情都弄糟了，我们才刚见面
Don't let's spoil everything. we've only just met.

165
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,410
- 你好  - 你好

167
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,350
是个抽雪茄的人

168
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:14,550
把烟灰扔得到处都是

169
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,260
希望我记得他
l expect l remember him.

00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:21,060
我可能要价很高的
l probably asked for too much money.

171
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:24,060
钱总是个问题，不是吗？
Money's always a problem, isn't it?

172
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,200
叫他回来
Tell him to come back.

173
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,140
你为什么要卖它？
why are you selling?

174
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,210
我想试试不同的东西
l'd like to try something different.

175
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,230
到别的地方去
Get off somewhere.

176
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:49,360
我受够了古董
l'm fed up with antiques.

177
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,950
到哪去？
Get off where?

178
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,680
去尼泊尔
To Nepal.

182

- Have you got a van?  - You can't take it now.

187
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,760

193
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,370
- 谁在乎呢？ - 给我

这个地区已经有同性恋和狮子狗了
Already there are queers and poodles in the area.

210

很好啊
They're great.

这些都不用，我最后拍到难以置信的东西
None of this lot. l've got something fab for the end.

ln a park. l only took them this morning. You'll get them later today.

非常平静，非常静寂
lt's very peaceful, very still.

225
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:26,530
书的其他部分用暴力的，这样最好了
And the rest of the book will be pretty violent, so it's best to end it like that.

226
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,140

227

我受够了那些骚娘们

235

真希望我有上吨的钞票

然后，就可以随心所欲了

随心所欲做什么？

238
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,730
像他一样随心所欲？

239
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,240
那个人我们认识吗？

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:59,800
[反战游行]

241
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,940
[要和平，不要战争]

242
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,370
很好
That'll be all right.

243
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:55,970

我是来取照片的

My private life's already in a mess. lt would be a disaster if....

259

解决问题不会是个灾难

276
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,780
我干嘛要跟她说话？
why should l speak to her?

277
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:42,090
抱歉，亲爱的，跟我一起的小鸟不想跟你说话
Sorry, love. The bird l'm with won't talk to you.

278
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:17,890
实际上她不是我妻子
She isn't my wife, really.

279
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,630
我们只是有一些小孩
we just have some kids.

280
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,430
不
No.

281
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,540
没有小孩，连小孩都没有
No kids. Not even kids.

282
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:32,840
有时候，感觉好像我们有小孩
Sometimes, though, it feels as if we had kids.

283
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:37,740
她并不漂亮，她…
She isn't beautiful. She's...

284
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:40,840
很容易相处
...easy to live with.

285
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,860
不，她不是的
No, she isn't.

286
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:50,200
这就是我不跟她住一起的原因
That's why l don't live with her.

287
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,520
但是即使跟漂亮女孩们在一起…
But even with beautiful girls...

288
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,250
你看着她们，就这样
...you look at them, and that's that.

289
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,130
这就是为什么她们最终会…
That's why they always end up by....

290
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:32,500
我整天跟她们呆在一起
And l'm stuck with them all day long.

291
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:37,740
男人都一样
lt would be the same with men.

292
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:44,610
听听这个
Have a listen to this.

293
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,350
不，安静别动
No. Keep still. Keep still.

294
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:03,520
听，别动
Listen and keep still.

295
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:12,010
如果喜欢，你可以抽烟
You can smoke if you like.

296
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,920
慢慢地慢慢地
Slowly. Slowly.

297
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:20,220
跟着节拍
Against the beat.

298
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:33,230
是的
That's it.

299
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:18,740
我受不了，我太紧张了
l can't stand it. l'm nervous enough as it is.

300
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:25,540
我能喝点水吗？
Can l have some water?

301
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:14,240
我不是傻瓜，亲爱的
And l'm not a fool, love.

302
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:25,210
能把照片给我吗？
Can l have the photographs?

303
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,080
当然
Of course.

304
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:29,040
稍等一下
Later.

305
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,910
你男朋友有点过时了
Your boyfriend's a bit past it.

306
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:44,090
为什么不开出你的条件呢？
why didn't you say what you want?

307
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,760
穿上衣服
Get dressed.

308
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:25,930
我会把不好的地方剪掉
l'll cut out the negatives you want.

309
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:24,190
他们会走的
They'll go.

310
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:28,860
他们没走
They're not going.

311
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,610
别走
Don't go.

312
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:50,080
- 你买的螺旋桨吗？ - 什么？
- Have you bought a propeller?  - what?

313
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,280
今天早上你买了螺旋桨，对吗？
You bought a propeller this morning, right?

314
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,250
噢，是的
Oh, yes.

315
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,780
你得帮帮我们
You'll have to give us a hand with it.

316
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,870
- 行了吗？ - 好了，是的
- All right?  - Fine. Yeah.

317
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,280
什么事？

318
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,850
没事，很漂亮
Nothing. lt's beautiful.

319
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:29,830
如果我有这么大的房子，我就把它挂在天花板上当电扇
lf l had a big room like this, l'd hang it from the ceiling like a fan.

320
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:34,490
- 你一个人住吗？ - 不
- Do you live on your own?  - No.

321
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:44,170
或许我会把它像雕刻品一样挂在那里
Perhaps l'll put it there like a piece of sculpture.

322
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:47,640
那样看起来会很好的，会分解立射光线
lt'll look good there. lt'll break up the straight lines.

323
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:12,460
- 你要走了吗？ - 很晚了
- Are you going?  - lt's late.

324
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:14,600
我还会再见到你吗？

325
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:21,540
至少告诉我你的名字，电话号码是多少
