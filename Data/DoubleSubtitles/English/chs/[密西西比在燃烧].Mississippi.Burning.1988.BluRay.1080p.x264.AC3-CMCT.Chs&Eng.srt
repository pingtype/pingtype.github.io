我不这么认为

或许喝了啤酒
Maybe they went for a beer.

136
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,060
这些男孩不会
Not these boys.

137
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,730
罗斯维尔民权办公室开始打电话来说他们没报到
The civil rights office in Rossville started making calls as soon as they didn't check in.

138
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,650
这里的警长办公室说不知道那些男孩在哪里
The sheriff's office here said they had no idea where the boys were.

139
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,650
第一个谎言
First lie.

140
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,740
谁撒谎？警长办公室还是民权办公室？
By who? The sheriff's office or the civil rights office?

141
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,040
你相信谁？
Who would you believe?

142
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,230
沃德先生 我不了解你是否知道这个
Mr. Ward, I don't know if you knew it or not,

143
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,500
我要是小密西西比镇警长希望这样
but I was a sheriff in a little Mississippi town just like this.

144
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,070
就知道你这么说
Yes, I'm aware of that, Mr. Anderson.

145
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,030
说谎又不要本钱
Well, lying just don't come into it, you know?

146
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,820
我们离孟菲斯十英里
We were right on the border, 10 miles from Memphis,

147
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,990
离世界其它地方数百万英里
and a million miles from the rest of the world.

148
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:52,090
那么 既然一个镇的警长这么说
Now, if a sheriff in a little town like this says that's what happened,

149
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,390
那就这么咯
then that's what happened.

150
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,930
去吃点东西
Let's go eat.

151
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,890
我们现在客满了 您愿意等等吗？
We're full up right now, honey. Y'all wanna wait a while?

152
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,240
值得等等吗？
Is the wait worth it?

153
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,870
并不会白等的 等待时 看看菜单吧？
We're not full for nothing, sugar. Y'all want to look at a menu while you wait?

154
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,660
- 当然  - 谢谢
- Sure.  - Thank you.

155
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,960
打算如何？等待还是离开？
Well, what y'all gonna do, wait or leave?

156
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,000
我们等 因为我们想亲近你
We're gonna wait, Because we want to be near you.

157
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,510
那里有空位
There's some empty seats down there.

158
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,050
沃德先生
Mr. Ward.

159
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:36,010
那里有黑人 想都别想
That's the colored down there. Don't even think about it.

160
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,330
这里有人要离开了
There's some people over here getting ready to leave right now.

161
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,680
你不饿吗？安德森先生
Aren't you hungry, Mr. Anderson?

162
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,860
下午好 气色看起来不错
Good afternoon. Looks good.

163
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,540
介意问你几个问题吗？
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

164
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,920
我正在找一些资料
I'm looking for some information.

165
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,740
无可奉告 先生
I ain't got nothing to say to you, sir.

166
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,390
只是几个问题
Just a few questions.

167
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,430
无可奉告 先生
I ain't got nothing to say to you, sir.

168
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,810
三个民权男孩来这里
Three civil rights boys came here

169
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,040
建议设立选民注册所
to propose setting up a voter registration clinic.

170
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,630
在当地居民赞成之前 三K党将其烧毁了
Before the locals got a chance to say yes, the Klan burned them down.

171
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,010
你让某个人表决 但是他不能表决
Give a man a vote, but don't let him use it.

172
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,080
那是操作程序
Wekk, that's the way it works.

173
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,050
罗斯维尔办公室怎么说？
What'd their office in Rossville have to say?

174
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:01,890
他们证实那些男孩回到这里向会众道歉
They confirmed that the boys came back here to apologize to the congregation.

175
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,540
对不起 你们没有表决权
Sorry you folks didn't get to vote.

176
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,900
我想大家从来不知道你们甚至有权
I suppose most of you never knew you even had one.

177
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,900
现在 你们没有地方做礼拜了
Now you got no place to go on Sunday.

178
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,950
显然 他们回到这之后 与沿途的居民有交谈
Apparently, after they came back here, they talked to some locals down the road.

179
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,520
我们应该从这里入手
I think that's where we should start.

180
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,190
嗯 你可以问问你他们 但他们不会说的
Well, you can talk to them, but they won't talk to you.

181
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,770
我们走后 这些人还得在这里生活
These people have to live here long after we're packed up and gone.

182
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,790
他们宁愿忍住不说 也不会告诉我们
They'd rather bite their tongue off than talk to us.

183
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,380
按局程序 安德森先生
Bureau procedure, Mr. Anderson.

184
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:42,060
教堂着火 而你跑回家 是这样吗？
The church caught fire and you ran home, is that correct?

185
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,020
是的
Yes, sir.

186
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,960
四个白人阻止你？
And then the four white men stopped you?

187
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,390
是的
Yes, sir.

188
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,150
这四个白人打你丈夫？
And these four white men attacked your husband?

189
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,860
是的
Yes, sir.

190
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,990
你不认识他们
But you can't identify them?

191
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,450
不认识
No, sir.

192
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,850
你把这报告给警察了吗？
Did you report this to the police?

193
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,910
没有
No, sir.

194
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,980
但你告诉民权男孩发生了什么？
But you told the civil rights boys what happened?

195
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,670
是的
Yes, sir.

196
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,130
夫人 他们说了要去那里吗？
Madam, did they tell you where they were going after that?

197
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,550
没有
No, sir.

198
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,580
什么也没有说？
Nothing?

199
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,680
没有
No, sir.

200
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,940
好的 谢谢 夫人
All right. Thank you, Madam.

201
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,020
别客气
You're welcome.

202
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,330
快点
Come on, boy.

203
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,830
开门
Open up.

204
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,940
你哥哥霍利斯在吗？
Your brother Hollis here?

205
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,120
在
Yes, sir.

206
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,710
叫他起来 我们要见他
Well, wake his ass up. We want to see him.

207
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,670
- 为什么？ - 叫他起来
- Why?  - Just wake him up, boy.

208
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,950
怎么了？发什么了什么？
Why? What's the matter?

209
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,380
你在呀
There you are!

210
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,760
来这里
Come here, boy!

211
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,330
霍利斯
Hollis!

212
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,390
回来 他妈的黑鬼
Get your ass back here, you fucking nigger!

213
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,270
霍利斯 霍利斯
Hollis! Hollis!

214
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,110
混蛋
Shit!

215
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,110
最好别让我们看到你和FBI说话
We better not catch you talking to the FBI.

216
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,660
否则你死定了
You'll be dead, boy.

217
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,350
你同情这些孩子？
You admire these kids, don't you?

218
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,770
你不吗？
Don't you?

219
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,520
我想他们是被利用了
I think they're being used.

220
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,780
他们被大众车送到这里 一群混蛋
I think they're being sent down here in their Volkswagens and their sneakers,

221
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,740
打爆了他们的头
just to get their heads cracked open.

222
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,330
你可曾想到或许他们坚信他们做的？
Did it ever occur to you that maybe they believed in what they were doing?

223
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,600
他们想过最终会死吗？
Did it ever occur to them they were gonna end up dead?

224
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,000
也许吧
Maybe.

225
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,790
在华盛顿 他们肯定就知道
In Washington they sure as hell knew, didn't they?

226
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,170
有一些事值得为之去死
Some things are worth dying for.

227
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:24,300
这里的人们领会有点不同
Down here they see things a little differently.

228
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,720
他们认为值得为一些事去杀人
People down here feel some things are worth killing for.

229
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:36,440
这一切仇视从何而来？
Where does it come from, all this hatred?

230
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,820
你知道 我还是小孩时
You know, when I was a little boy,

231
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,280
一个名叫门罗的黑人老农住在我们街的另一头
an old Negro farmer lived down the road, name of Monroe.

232
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,660
他是…
And he was...

233
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,580
我想他只比我父亲运气好一点
I guess he was a little luckier than my daddy was.

234
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,670
他买了一头骡子
He bought himself a mule.

235
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,170
这是那个镇周围的一笔大交易
That was a big deal around that town.

236
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,130
我父亲讨厌那头骡子
My daddy hated that mule.

237
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,450
因为他的朋友骗他说
Because his friends were always kidding him about

238
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,680
看到门罗用骡子耕地
how they saw Monroe plowing with his new mule.

239
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:16,940
既然有一头骡子 门罗打算租另一块地
And Monroe was gonna rent another field now that he had a mule.

240
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,690
一天早上骡子死了
One morning that mule just showed up dead.

241
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,150
他们在水里下毒
They poisoned the water.

242
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,410
打那之后 我父亲再没提过那头骡子
And after that, there was never any mention about that mule around my daddy.

243
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,700
从来没再提过
Just never came up.

244
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,700
一次我们沿街开车
So one time, we were driving down the road,

245
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,540
经过门罗的地方 那里空荡荡的
and we passed Monroe's place and we saw it was empty.

246
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,050
我想他刚收拾行李离开了吧 去北边或其他地方
He just packed and left. I guess gone up north or something.

247
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:50,390
我一看父亲的脸
I looked over at my daddy's face

248
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,100
就知道是他干的
and I knew he'd done it.

249
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:58,560
他也清楚我知道 他很羞愧
He saw that I knew. He was ashamed.

250
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,020
我想他很羞愧
I guess he was ashamed.

251
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,900
他看着我说
He looked at me and he said,

252
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,570
“儿子 要是不能优于黑人 还能优于谁？”
"If you ain't any better than a nigger, son, who are you better than? "

253
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,810
你认为那是理由吗？
You think that's an excuse?

254
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:18,660
这不是理由 这只是我父亲的故事
No, it's not an excuse. It's just a story about my daddy.

255
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,910
为此你离开了那里？
Where's that leave you?

256
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,700
如此充满憎恨的一个老人
With an old man that was just so full of hate

257
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:33,470
他不知道那是贫穷扼杀了他
that he didn't know being poor was what was killing him.

258
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,940
关掉灯 关掉灯
Get the light! Get the light!

259
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,440
你没事吧？
You all right?

260
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,290
他们知道我们在这里
I guess they know we're here.

261
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,250
现在你知道你到了什么地方
Now you know what you're getting into.

262
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:42,000
我会与华盛顿联系 请求派更多的密探
I'm gonna call Washington. I need more agents.

263
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,000
我说这是错误的做法 你会改变主意吗？
Would it make any difference if I told you that's exactly the wrong thing to do?

264
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,670
不会
No.

265
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,350
整个地方一个月七十五元
The whole place for 75 a month.

266
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,640
这是个私人场所 在镇中心 是个很好的地方
It's private, it's central, it's perfect.

267
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:45,020
能容纳一百多个密探 或许两百个
There's room for 100 more agents. 200, maybe.

268
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,000
如果加上楼座
More on the balcony.

269
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,130
安德森先生 我们在找三个男孩
We're trying to find the three boys, Mr. Anderson.

270
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,280
我会接受一切能得到的帮助
I'll take all the help I can get.

271
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,530
这机遇何时开始的？
When's the show start?

272
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,450
是谁？
Who's the big shot?

273
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,050
三K党
That's the Klans.

274
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:58,680
没有尖帽子 却有许多的尖头
No pointy hats, but plenty of pointy heads.

275
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,220
我去查查车牌
Let me run a check on the plates.

276
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,000
下午好 先生们
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

277
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,460
安德森
Anderson.

278
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,420
来向市长提尔曼先生问候
Won't you say hello to our mayor, Mr. Tilman, here?

279
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,450
你好 安德森
How do you do, Anderson?

280
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,340
市长先生 理发师先生
Mr. Mayor, Mr. Barber.

281
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,970
看起来象一个地方
This looks like the place to be.

282
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,270
即使对我来说
Even for me.

283
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,940
没有比理发店更舒服的地方了
Nothing like a barber shop for jawing your socks off.

284
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,760
你从何处来？安德森
Where you from anyway, Anderson?

285
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,400
密西西比州桑顿市
Thornton, Mississippi, sir.

286
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,320
从田纳西州来只是胡说
Just a spit from Tennessee.

287
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:03,030
你必须懂得这里的规矩
Well then you must know how we all feel down here.

288
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,870
我们不喜欢告诉外人我们怎样生活
We don't take to outsiders telling us how to live our lives.

289
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,700
我很乐意告诉你这里的黑人很快乐
And I'm here to tell you our nigras were happy,

290
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,700
直到那些披头族把事情搞得沸沸扬扬
till those beatnik college kids came down here stirring things up.

291
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,710
在这之前没有任何人抱怨
Before that, there wasn't anybody complaining.

292
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,670
没人敢吧
Nobody dared.

293
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,340
这里有一个真正平安的社区 安德森
We got a real peaceful community down here, Anderson.

294
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:28,390
他们就象其他民族 你要是逼得过分…
Of course they're just like any other folks, I reckon, and push them too far...

295
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,310
我估计会象三捆旧炸药
The way I figure it, it's like three sticks of old dynamite.

296
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,530
要是触发了 就得上街收尸
You shake it up, and we're gonna be scraping bodies off the street.

297
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,610
我只是来调查三个失踪的孩子 问一些问题
I'm just down here to investigate the missing three kids, ask some questions.

298
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,900
即使全部归结起来是肉汁
If this all boiled down to gravy,

299
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,950
也盖不住鸡油煎牛排
there wouldn't be enough to cover up a chicken-fried steak.

300
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,620
你要找的孩子？我敢跟你打赌
Them kids you're looking for? I'll just about bet you a shiny new dime

301
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,490
他们一定在芝加哥
they're sitting up in Chicago right now

302
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:59,160
喝着冰啤酒 笑着谈论
drinking a cold beer and having a big laugh

303
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,400
在这里引起的混乱
about all the commotion they've stirred up down here.

304
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,880
我当然希望如此
Well, I sure hope so.

305
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,720
你可以告诉你上司
You tell your bosses

306
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:09,260
人们有对南方的偏见
people got the wrong idea about the South.

307
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,600
你知道我指的是什么
You know what I'm talking about.

308
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:15,310
人人衣着褴褛 落后 文盲
Everybody running around ragged, backwards, illiterate,

309
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,270
一日三餐腌猪肉和玉米饼
eating sow-belly and corn pone three times a day.

310
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,450
安德森 简单的事实是我们有两种文明
Simple fact is, Anderson, we got two cultures down here.

311
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:27,200
白种人文明和有色人种文明
White culture, and the colored culture.

312
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,560
这一直存在
That's the way it always has been.

313
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,790
并且会永远存在
That's the way it always will be.

314
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,070
美国其他地方看不到
Rest of America don't see it that way, Mr. Mayor.

315
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,460
美国其他地方屁都没有
Rest of America don't mean jack shit.

316
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,880
你在密西西比州
You in Mississippi now.

317
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,220
这是肯定的
That's for sure.

318
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,700
理发师先生 比分多少？
What's the score, Mr. Barber?

319
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,640
圣·路易斯队领先 五比零
St. Louis on top, five to nothing.

320
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,040
哪一局？
What inning is it?

321
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,390
第七局末
Bottom of the seventh.

322
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,330
安德森 你喜欢棒球？
You like baseball, do you, Anderson?

323
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,100
嗯 我喜欢 你知道…
Yeah, I do. You know...

324
00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:00,820
只有那时黑人在白人面前挥舞棍棒
It's the only time when a black man can wave a stick at a white man

325
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,360
不认为是暴乱
and not start a riot.

326
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,710
长官
Sir.

327
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:25,010
我们查过了车牌 是克莱顿·汤利
We checked on the plate, sir. Clayton Townley.

328
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:29,260
汤利 三K党白骑士团的大巫师
Townley. Grand Wizard of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.

329
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:32,220
就是他 我们有此车的线索
That's him. Oh, and I think we have a lead on the car, sir.

330
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,600
旅馆的一个乔克托人知道在何处
A Choctaw on the reservation thinks he knows where it is.

331
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,040
我在等一个电话
I'm waiting for a call.

332
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,350
很好
Good.

333
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,860
下周二有约会吗？
You have your appointment next Tuesday, right?

334
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,420
到时见 再见
I'll see you then. Bye-bye.

335
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,730
你要去…
You gonna go to...

336
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,820
下午好 女士们
Afternoon, ladies.

337
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,400
能为你效劳吗？
Can I help you?

338
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:34,330
嗯 我告诉你 我只是… 我只是不喜欢这个发型 明白吗？
Well, yes, you can. I tell you, I just... I hate the way I look, you know?

339
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:39,710
你认为怎么样？烫发？还是漂白？
What do you think? A permanent wave, maybe, or a bleached job or something?

340
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,500
这看起来不错 在这里做的吗？
Now, that looks pretty good. Did you have that done in here?

341
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,400
不 是在杰克逊
No! Jackson.

342
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,900
假发是你唯一的指望
I think a wig's your only hope, hon.

343
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,530
你的脑袋不可能有更多选择
You ain't gonna be able to do much with that cue ball.

344
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,970
谢谢你
Thank you.

345
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:55,220
即使你要问一些问题 这就是你所听到的一切
If you wanna ask custom questions, this is where you'll hear it all.

346
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,200
事实上 我要问的是
Yeah, well, matter of fact, I do, you know.

347
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,300
嗯
Yeah.

348
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,650
我想知道刚刚驱车过去的那位先生
I was just wondering who that gentleman was that just drove in over there.

349
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,630
我知道那不是约翰逊总统
Now, I know that isn't President Johnson.

350
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:06,190
他是汤利 克莱顿·汤利
He's name is Townley, Clayton Townley.

351
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,260
你是FBI？
Are you one of them FBI gentlemen?

352
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,150
是的 夫人
Yes, Madam, I am.

353
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,520
那两个孩子要是死了 真令人惋惜
Well if you ask me, I think it's a shame those two kids are dead,

354
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,580
希望你找到他们
but I sure hope you find them.

355
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:19,830
谢谢 其实有三个孩子失踪 还有一个是黑人
Thank you. Actually, it's three kids that are missing. There is a colored kid also.

356
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,790
是否没有两个白人 你们就不会来？
Do you honestly think you people'd be down here at all, if it weren't for those two white boys?

357
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,750
- 也许不是 小姐  - 是夫人
- Maybe not, Miss  - Mrs.

358
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:30,260
她丈夫是佩尔 雷·斯塔基的副警长
Pell. Her old man's Ray Stuckey's deputy.

359
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,460
我单身
But I'm single.

360
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,980
快看 他们来了
Look out! Here they come!

361
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,700
霍利斯？
Hollis?

362
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,030
退后 让开
Get back. Move out of the way.

363
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,540
我们会照料 这是地方问题
We'll take care of this. It's a local problem.

364
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:07,000
我们会处理 不需要你们帮忙
We'll handle this! We don't need your damn help!

365
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:14,680
大街上有血不太好 电视新闻会怎么说？
It ain't right having blood on Main Street. How'd that look on TV news?

366
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,260
- 起来  - 我来扶
- Okay, easy.  - Get up.

367
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,250
好的 我扶住他了 我扶好了
Okay, I got him. I got him.

368
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,100
让开
Get out of the way, now.

369
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,000
他是那就餐者的孩子
That's the kid from the diner.

370
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,860
在你和黑人孩子交谈之前 要再三考虑
Now maybe you'll think twice before you talk to colored kids with an audience.

371
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,070
你知道图珀洛方面发来了消息
They're just sending a message from the big boss from Tupelo and you know it!

372
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,400
我知道 克莱顿·汤利 尖头的头目
I know it, yes. Clayton Townley, a chief pointy head.

373
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,490
没错 你怎么知道？
Yeah, that's right. How did you know?

374
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,810
有时也该按局程序 沃德先生
Bureau procedure, Mr. Ward. You ought to try it sometime.

375
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,540
我们会
We did!

376
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,580
我们找过那些孩子开的汽车
We found the car the kids were driving.

377

我要搜索该区
I want the entire area searched.

00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,090
彻底的搜索
Every inch.

384
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,350
是 长官
Yes, sir.

385
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,710
这是一片大沼泽
It's a big swamp.

386
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,690
伯德先生 彻底搜索
Every inch, Mr. Bird.

387
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,950
他们绝对没有离开密西西比州
I guess they never left Mississippi.

388
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:25,530
他们死了
Yeah, they're dead. They're dead.

389

伯德先生
Mr. Bird!

390
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,950

Yes, sir?

391
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,670
停车场有电话
There's a telephone back at the truck stop.

392
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:36,880
去那 打电话 给我叫一百多人来
Get to it, get on it and get me a hundred more men here by morning.

393
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,920
- 一百？ - 一百
- A hundred?  - A hundred.

394
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,700
要局里人吗？长官
What, Bureau people, sir?

395
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,340
我不管是否是军队
I don't care if it's the goddamn army!

396
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,500
我只要搜索整个沼泽
I want this entire swamp searched!

是 长官
Yes, sir.

398
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:52,390
沃德先生 别这样 你要发动一场战争
Don't do it, Mr. Ward. You'll just start a war.

399
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,150
我们来之前 就是一场战争了
It was a war long before we got here.

400
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,270
你也是
You too!

401
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,370
醒醒 起来
Wake up! Come on!

402
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:57,380
离开这里 黑鬼 快走
Get the fuck out of here, nigger! Go on!

403
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,170
长官
Sir?

404
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,200
警长确实不在现场
The sheriff's alibi is solid.

405
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,420
那时他与舅子和两个堂弟在玩扑克
He was playing poker with his wife's brother and two cousins.

406
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,740
多久？
The whole time?

407
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,680
三个小时 他输了十一块三毛八
No, for three hours. He lost $11.38.

408
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,910
还有件事
There's something else, sir.

409
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:54,890
汽车旅馆经理找我们的麻烦
We're having a little trouble with the motel manager.

410
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,210
什么麻烦？
What kind of trouble?

411
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,350
他要我们离开
He wants us out.

412
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,420
他说我们妨碍了他的生意
He says we're bad for business.

413
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,310
买下来
Buy it.

414
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,190
什么？长官
Sorry, sir?

415
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,150
买下来
Buy it!

416
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,110
汽车旅馆
The motel.

417
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,850
我能出多高的价？
How high can I go?

418
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,740
不惜一切
Whatever it takes.

419
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,960
今天在密西西比州杰瑟普县
Today in Jessup County, Mississippi,

420
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,810
在本周的暴行中
amidst the violence that has erupted here this week,

421
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,960
政府决定寻找
the eyes of the nation had been firmly fixed on the search

422
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,070
三个失踪的民权工作者
for the three missing civil rights workers.

423
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,800
我想这是一个大骗局
Well, I think it's all a big hoax.

424
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,400
要是在沼泽 就会找得到
But if they are in that swamp, then they asked for it.

425
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:53,240
海军预备队和FBI密探一起
Naval reserves have been brought in to join scores of FBI agents

426
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,450
寻找失踪者
in their search for the missing men.

427
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:57,600
他们有密谋
I think they planned the whole thing.

428
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,210
他们正在纽约嘲笑我们密西西比人
They're sitting up there in New York laughing at us Mississippi folks.

429
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,400
- 你认为是一个骗局吗？ - 是的
- You think it's a hoax?  - Yeah, I think so.

430
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,420
一个大的骗局 什么也找不到
I think it's a big hoax. They ain't gonna find nothing.

431
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:10,090
民权领袖对失踪者的下落乐观
Civil rights leaders here are still optimistic as to the men's young whereabouts,

432
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,600
而私下却忧心失踪者是否活着
but privately, there is mounting concern that they will ever be found alive.

433
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,350
他们在自找麻烦 我认为他们已经陷入麻烦了
They came down here looking for trouble and I think they found it.

434
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,940
新闻网马雷克·鲍伯比在密西西比州杰瑟普县报道
This is Marek Barlbobi, Network News, Jessup County, Mississippi.

435
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,400
我来告诉你 我告诉你他们应该做什么
I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what they ought to be doing.

436
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,610
我认为他们应该去加拿大寻找
They ought to be looking up there in Canada for them boys

437
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,320
而不是在我们这里的沼泽
instead of our swamps around here.

438
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:34,500
我还会告诉你些别的事情 我想这是NAAC的人
I'll tell you something else too. I think it's a publicity stunt

439
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,120
想入非非的表演
dreamed up by these NAACP people.

440
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,520
NAAC的人？
NAACP people?

441
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,910
是的 NAACP（全国有色人种协进会）
Yeah, NAACP.

442
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,000
知道代表什么吗？
I bet you're all wondering what it stands for.

443
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,170
代表着黑鬼 鳄鱼 猿 浣熊 负鼠
It stands for niggers, alligators, apes, coons and possums.

444
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,210
你有什么 你有你的NAACP（全国有色人种协进会）
Tell you what you got. You got your NAACP,

445
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,840
你有你的SNCC 你有你的COFO
you got your SNCC, you got your COFO.

446
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:54,010
你知道所有的混乱是什么吗？
You know what that mess is?

447
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:57,560
是胡说 你懂吗？
B-U-L-L-S-H-l-T. You got it?

448
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,520
警长 这会是一个联邦案件吗？
Sheriff, will this be a federal case?

449
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,920
有一天 我们不必说
One day there'll come a time when we won't have to say,

450
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,520
“早上好 警长先生”
"Good morning, sir, Mr. Sheriff."

451
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:12,320
或许那时我们不必说“斯塔基先生”
Maybe there'll come a time when we won't have to say, "Mr. Stuckey".

452
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:16,910
有一天 我们只说“斯塔基”或“警长”
One day there'll come a time when we just say "Stuckey" or "Sheriff".

453
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:21,410
有一天 警长甚至不是白人
And one day there'll come a time when the sheriff won't even be a white man.

454
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:34,340
你好
Hello.

455
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,850
是否能问你一些问题？
I wonder if I could ask you a few questions?

456
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:44,890
我不认为你会告诉我这是哪种花
I don't suppose you could tell me what kind of flower these are, could you?

457
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:48,900
我看这里到处都是…
I been seeing them all over the place here and...

458
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:52,400
从来没见过这么漂亮的植物
I never saw such a darn pretty plant.

459
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,310
叫瓶子草
They're trumpet pitchers.

460
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,200
瓶子草？
Trumpet pitchers?

461
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,370
真的美丽
They're beautiful. They really are.

462
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,960
气味不怎么样 但漂亮
They don't smell so good, but they're pretty.

463
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,400
很高兴与你谈话
It's nice talking to you.

464
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,550
很抱歉打断你们的聚会
Sorry about interrupting your meeting here,

465
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,120
可没有人愿与我们交谈
but we can't seem to get anybody to talk to us.

466
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,510
象我妈妈往常说的 他们封嘴了
They just zip up, like my mama used to say.

467
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,000
人们不想和你交谈
The reason people don't wanna talk to you

468
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,100
是因为害怕涉及法律
is because they're afraid it'll get back to the law.

469
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,090
我们就是法律
We are the law.

470
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,520
你们不是这里的
Not around here, you ain't.

471
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,690
我们来查那些男孩出了什么事
We were sent here to find out what happened to those three boys.

472
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,800
他们是来这里帮你们的
They were here to help you.

473
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,900
你们不应该和有色人交谈
It ain't colored floks you should be talking to.

474
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,520
该和谁交谈呢？
Who should we be talking to?

475
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,160
走吧 亚伦
Come on, Aaron.

476
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,500
你们应当去警长办公室
You should start with the sheriff's office.

477
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,150
你为什么不害怕？
Why ain't you afraid?

478
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,610
为什么你不害怕？
How come you ain't?

479
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,920
亚伦
Aaron.

480
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,630
亚伦 走吧

Here's the pitch. Swing and a line-drive base hit!

482
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:12,610
一人回本垒
Another runner's home!

483
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:19,280
下个投手是鲍勃·吉布森 他有点紧张
On to the next pitch by the ruffled Bob Gibson. He is upset.

484
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:21,000
罗恩·亨特一垒打
Ron Hunt singled to center.

485
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,540
希克曼上了三垒 麦兹队赢得第二场
Hickman rounded third and scored the Mets' second run of the game.

486
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,960
亨特在一垒 麦兹队二比一领先
Hunt holds on at first, and the Mets now lead 2 to 1.

And the next one up there will be Joe Christopher,

Good evening, Mrs. Pell. I'm Agent Ward. This is Agent Anderson.

我们是FBI 你丈夫在家吗？
We're with the FBI. Is your husband home?

491
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:51,340
我们想和他谈谈
We'd like to have a word with him.

492
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,900
进来吧
Y'all come in, then.

It's the FBI gentlemen, Clinton. They wanna ask you some more questions.

我把你的晚餐放到烤炉去？
You want me to put your dinner in the oven?

495

496
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,460
介意我坐一坐吗？
Mind if I take a seat?

497
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,010
什么该死的事要在家里打扰我？
What's so goddamn important you gotta bother me at home?

498
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:24,410
只是想再要你谈谈
Well, I just wanted to run through, once again,

499
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,390

Now, deputy, we both know what day we're talking about.

Please, don't let me interrupt you.

506
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,280
一个问题被问十几遍
It's just that when you've heard a question

507
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:59,670
是有点令人厌烦
asked a dozen times, it gets kind of boring.

508
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,630
是的 我同意
Yeah, I guess so.

509
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,790
你们不一同吃吗？
You don't eat together?

510

他工作时间不定

511
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,310
你觉得奇怪吗？
You think that's odd?

512
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,500
不…
No. No...

513
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:21,190
我自己就这样
I work funny hours myself.

514
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:26,030
我饿了 就吃 他饿了 他就吃

This is a nice house. How long have you lived here?

517

我在这里出生
I was born here.

518
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:38,840
很久以前我父亲玩扑克游戏输掉了这房子
But my father lost the house in a poker game one night a long time ago.

519
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,590
从那以后我们一直支付房租
We've been paying rent ever since.

520
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,550
那是一种邪恶的游戏
It's a wicked game.

521
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,480
扑克
Poker.

00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:56,100
是邪恶的
Wicked.

523
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,860

Good night.

527
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:17,790
去看你的棒球吧 你知道他们在说什么 是吧？
Let's get back to baseball. You know what they say, don't you?

528
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,610
那是黑人能挥动棍棒的唯一比赛…
It's the only game where a black man can wave a stick and...

529
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,960
我知道 我已经听说了
I know that. I already heard that one.

530
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,600
五十分钟不在现场的证明取决于他的妻子
50 minutes of his alibi hinges on his wife.

531
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:33,460
你和她谈过 她怎么样？

532
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,930
她是一个好女人
She's a nice lady.

533
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:38,690
安德森先生 一个女人怎么这样结局…
Tell me, Mr. Anderson, how does a woman like that end up...

534
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,650
与一个混蛋一起？
With Shithead in there?

535
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,700
你知道这些小镇象什么
You know these small towns are like.

536
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,190
一个女孩在高中花费所有时间
A girl spends her entire time in high school

537
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,400
寻找她要嫁的人
looking for the guy she's gonna marry,

538
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,950
花费她的有生之年想知道为什么
then spends the rest of her life trying to figure out why.

539
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,790
也许错了 他过分自信
There's something's too wrong with him. He's too confident.

540
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,580
- 你看到了结婚照片？ - 没有
- Did you see the wedding photograph?  - No.

541
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:59,400
三个迎宾朋友用拇指钩住腰带
His three pals are ushers, they had this way of hooking their thumbs in their belts

542
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,920
三个手指尖向下
with the three fingers pointing down like that.

543
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:05,100
是什么呢？共济会会员特征吗？
So, what is that? Some sort of Masonic thing?

544
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,200
不
No!

545
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:09,010
是KKK
KKK.

546
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,040
我知道你没醉 我不想和你吵
I know you ain't drunk. I ain't gonna argue.

547
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,520
- 我没醉  - 你没醉
- I'm not drunk.  - All right, you ain't drunk.

548
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:22,940
我只是带你到睡觉的地方去
I'm just gonna take you where you can sleep it off.

549
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:25,570
好吧 站稳
All right, hold up.

550
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:30,410
- 谁在开车？ - 小心头
- Who's driving?  - Watch your head.

551
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,840
噢
Hi.

552
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,970
有几件事情需要和你谈谈
There was a couple things I need to check with you.

553
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,160
我丈夫不在家
My husband's not here.

554
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,970
实际上 我是想和你谈谈
Well, actually, it was you I wanted to talk to.

555
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,140
- 和我？ - 是的
- Me?  - Yeah.

556
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:41,350
好吧 你进来吧
Okay. Well, you better come in, then.

557
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,440
只一会儿
Just take a minute.

558
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:49,780
我的上司有点讨人厌 大学生嘛
My boss, he's kind of a pain. You know, the college kid.

559
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,610
一板一眼 循规蹈矩
He has to dot all the I's and cross all the T's.

560
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,520
你要问我什么呢？
What is it you want to ask me about?

561
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,450
这是一个跟时间有关的问题
Well, it's a time type thing.

562
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,520
一些事情我们还没弄清楚…
A couple of things we're just not clear about...

563
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:02,670
应该把你的花放到水里吗？
Wouldn't it be better if I put your flowers in some water while you're here?

564
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,750
其实是给你的
Yeah. Well, actually, they're for you.

565
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,910
很漂亮
They're beautiful.

566
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,800
是很漂亮
They are pretty, aren't they?

567
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:12,800
气味不怎么样 但漂亮
They don't smell so nice, but they're pretty.

568
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:16,330
来点什么吗？茶？
Can I get you anything? Would you like some tea?

569
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:17,930
嗯 谢谢
Yeah, I would. Thanks.

570
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:36,570
噢 别看那 一张糟糕的照片
Oh, don't you look at that. It's a terrible photo.

571
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,490
我可不这么认为
Oh, I don't know about that.

572
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:41,360
是最近的吗？
Is this recent?

573
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,330
不 我也希望
No. I wish.

574
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,360
对我而言是新近的
Well, this sure looks recent to me.

575
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,710
我们十四年前结的婚
We were married 14 years ago.

576
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,990
开玩笑吧？不… 别逗了
Are you kidding me? No, that... Come on!

577
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,540
要加糖吗？
You take sugar?

578
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,760
当然要
Sure do.

579
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:59,210
我是在象这样的镇子长大的
You know, I grew up in a town like this.

580
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:01,520
你很聪明 所以走了
You were smart enough to leave.

581
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,750
你为什么不走呢？
Why didn't you?

582
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:05,900
“无所谓了”
"For better or for worse."

583
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,400
你怎么样？结婚了吗？
How about you? Are you married?

584
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:13,740
两次
Two.

585
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:17,280
结过婚 据我记忆
Well, I was, as I remember.

586
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:20,410
没有持续很久 我从未回家
It didn't last very long. I was never home.

587
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:24,370
她厌倦了迈阿密的电话
I guess she got fed up with phone calls from Miami

588
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:27,210
和得梅因的明信片
and postcards from Des Moines.

589
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:29,840
周围总有某个小伙子
There was always a guy around.

590
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:34,970
有时间看电影或喝啤酒
Any guy that could spare the time for a movie or a beer

591
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,260
或随自动唱机的音乐跳舞
or a quarter for the jukebox.

592
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:41,560
她离开了
She left.

593
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:47,130
你怎么样？
How about you?

594
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:50,110
安德森先生 你了解南方
Oh, you know the South, Mr. Anderson.

595
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:54,820
高中毕业后嫁给第一个使你微笑的男孩
You leave high school, marry the first boy that makes you laugh.

596
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:57,150
你丈夫是相当不错的小伙子
Your husband's quite a guy.

597
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:03,830
我上司说大约有一个小时
You know, my boss has this thing about an hour,

598
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:08,420
准确的说是五十分钟 你丈夫说他和你在一起
50 minutes to be exact, that your husband says that he's with you.

599
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,130
我想是的
And I guess he was.

600
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,010
我想是
Guess he was.

601
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,050
真遗憾
Well, that's a pity.

602
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:27,270
这意味着我没有借口赖在这里了
Because that means that I don't have an excuse for hanging around here anymore.

603
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,690
嗯…
Well...

604
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,680
感谢你的冰镇茶
Thank you for the iced tea.

605
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,440
感谢你给的鲜花
Thank you for the flowers.

606
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:36,820
当然
Sure.

607
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:41,620
你知道是哪种花吗？
Do you know what kind they are?

608
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:45,020
听说叫瓶子草
A fellow told me they're called trumpet pitchers.

609
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,330
没错
Oh, that's right.

610
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:50,460
我父亲称它是地狱女人 因为它们…
My daddy used to call them "ladies from hell", because they're car...

611
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:52,190
食虫
Carnivorous.

612
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:53,710
- 就这样？ - 嗯
- That's the word?  - Yeah.

613
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,820
漂亮的颜色是诱饵
You see, that pretty color's the bait.

614
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,830
昆虫只要进入就会死亡
Insects just home on in, and, wham, they're dead

615
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:02,550
即使他们尽力逃脱
even before they got their shoes off.

616
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,880
或许我应摘别的东西
Maybe I should've picked something more appropriate.

617
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,640
或许
Maybe.

黑鬼 已警告过你
You already been told once, nigger!

633
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,300
不必再警告你了
Now we don't want to have to tell you again!

634
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:46,200
你会有更多的麻烦
You go making any more trouble

635
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,550
向联邦的人多嘴
or flapping them bootlips off to any of them federal men,

636
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,620
我们一定会把你埋了
and we sure as hell gonna have to put you in the ground, boy.

637
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,100
决不会有松树箱
And that's without a pine box!

638
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,480
明白吗？
You understand me? !

639
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:12,490
在密西西比州如何对待黑人？
How do you think the Negroes have been treated here in Mississippi?

640
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:17,000
要公平对待 理应受到应有的对待
They're treated about fair. About as good as they ought to be.

641
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,550
很长时间以来黑人在这里受着可怕的对待
If you ask me, the niggers around here have been treated bad for a long time.

642
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:41,270
我认为马丁·路德·金是领导者之一
Again, I think Martin Luther King's one of the leaders.

643
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,280
J·埃德加·胡佛说他是一个共产主义者
I mean, J. Edgar Hoover said that he was a Communist.

644
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,610
并已证明了这一点 但我不知是否真实
And they had proof to that effect, but, you know, I don't know that for sure.

645
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:51,370
我没亲自看到 是他们说的
I hadn't seen it myself, but that's what they say.

646
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:07,300
你真的希望找到那黑人吗？
Hey, you really wanna find that nigger?

647
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:12,850
他们说要我们与黑人吃在一起 使用相同的浴室
They say we've got to eat together and use the same bathrooms as the niggers.

648
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:16,220
密西西比人很难做到
That's awfull hard for some Mississippi folks to do.

649
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:20,310
他们不喜欢我们 他们不洗澡 有股恶臭
They're not like us. They don't take baths. They stink.

650
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,230
他们… 他们有点下流
They... They're nasty.

651
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:24,900
他们不喜欢白人
They just not like white folks.

652
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,810
你认为那三个男孩会怎样？
What do you think has happened to the three boys?

653
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:34,700
死了
Dead.

654
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,160
就当他们死了
Just as dead as they can be.

655
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,960
这感觉真好
Feels so good.

656
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:45,590
她睡了吗？
Is she asleep? Is she?

657
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:51,430
很抱歉 吵醒你了
I'm sorry I woke you up.

658
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,500
再见 我要出去几个小时
Bye, hon. I'm gonna be a couple hours.

659
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,680
好的
All right.

660
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,270
玛莉 那是贝齐的孩子吗？
Well, Mary, is that your Betsy's kid?

661
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:03,350
是的 她长的真快 是吧？
Yeah, she's growing up real quick, isn't she?

662
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,650
好了
Come on.

663
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,240
玛莉 到星期二就好了
Tuesday will be just fine on those, Mary.

664
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,040
有趣
Funny.

665
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:26,840
他们的孩子都那么可爱
Their kids are so cute.

666
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,550
- 我们走吧  - 那事能靠我吗？
- Here we go.  - Is that thing back on me again?

667
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,640
整个特勤处都保护不了总统
If the entire Secret Service couldn't protect the president of the United States,

668
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:42,700
我们又怎能保护一些黑人？
how on the hell are we supposed to protect a few nigras?

669
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,700
我再说一次 并非没什么
I'm telling you again, it ain't nothing but

670
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:48,610
只是一些下层白人喝了太多廉价酒
a bunch of low-life white trash drinking too much cheap alcohol.

671
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:53,450
更象天拿水和蛇汁 因为口感象马丁尼酒一样
More like paint thinner and snake juice, because this state's as dry as a martini.

672
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,820
一些酒鬼可以证明这一点
And we got the alcoholics to prove it.

673
00:56:56,210 --> 00:57:01,400
劳驾 请让个地方 劳驾 鲍勃
Excuse me. Give me a little room here. Excuse me. Excuse me, Bob.

674
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,940
- 行吗？ - 请问你的名字？
- Is this okay?  - Your name, please?

675
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,710
克莱顿·汤利 当地商人
Clayton Townley, local businessman.

676
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,960
你是三K党白骑士团的发言人？
Are you, sir, a spokesman for the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan?

677
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:15,300
我告诉你 我是商人
I told you. I'm a businessman.

678
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:19,010
我也是一个密西西比人 一个美国人
I'm also a Mississippian and an American.

679
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:22,350
我和许多密西西比人都讨厌
And I'm getting sick and tired of the way many of us Mississippians

680
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,980
报纸和电视在歪曲我们的看法
are having our views distorted by you newspaper people and on the TV.

681
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:28,190
所以我们很坦率
So let's get this straight.

682
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:32,030
我们不接受犹太人 因为他们拒绝基督
We do not accept Jews, because they reject Christ.

683
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:34,850
他们对国际银行业联盟的控制
And their control of the international banking cartels

684
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,360
实质是共产主义
are at the root of what we call Communism today.

685
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:41,160
我们不接受罗马公教徒 因为他们屈服于罗马独裁者
We do not accept papists, because they bow to a Roman dictator.

686
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:45,160
我们不接受土耳其人 蒙古人 鞑靼人 东方人
We do not accept Turks, Mongols, Tartars, Orientals now Negroes,

687
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:46,970
我们在这里保护
because we're here to protect

688
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:50,810
盎格鲁撒克逊人的民主政治以及美国人的方式
Anglo-Saxon democracy and the American way.

689
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:52,750
谢谢 先生
Thank you, sir.

690
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:59,390
你是亲属间不应该有性关系的活证据
I swear to God, Lester, you are living proof that cousins shouldn't fuck.

691
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,850
我是说 这个有色男孩
What I was trying to say, there's this colored boy.

692
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:08,230
他想参加阿拉巴马州贝尔·布莱恩特的橄榄球队
He wants to play football for Bear Bryant over at Alabama.

693
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,920
贝尔说“我给你一次尝试的机会”
So Bear says, "I'm gonna give you a tryout."

694
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,190
他拿着什么跑呢？一个西瓜吗？
What's he gonna run with, a watermelon?

695
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,320
他还在继续跑
And he's gonna keep on running too.

696
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:21,450
他说“你去球门线那里”
He says, "Okay, boy, you get down there on one goal line."

697
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:24,450
他要整个队去另一球门线 整个队
He puts the whole other team on the other goal line. Whole other team!

698
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:26,310
把球扔给男孩说…
He throws the boy the ball and he says...

699
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:33,910
营业吗？
Are you open?

700
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,760
你会是一名成员 在这喝酒
You gotta be a member to drink here.

701
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,800
一名成员？
Member?

702
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:40,180
什么成员？
A member of what?

703
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,600
社交俱乐部成员
Member of the social club.

704
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:48,730
我还以为你买啤酒给我
I thought you'd just buy me a beer.

705
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:52,770
弗兰克 给他一瓶啤酒
Give him a beer, Frank.

706
00:58:56,490 --> 00:58:59,240
很高兴再次回到酒县
Nice to be back in a dry county again.

707
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:02,410
我当警长时 一半薪水
When I was sheriff, about half of my take-home pay

708
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:06,200
来自向这样非法的家族征收的税款
was from collecting taxes on illegal jukes like this.

709
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:07,540
大概这里也如此
Probably works the same here.

710
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:12,000
我想你也捞了一大笔钱 所以装作没看见走私贩
I was thinking you'd haul in a tidy penny here, winking at the bootleggers.

711
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:14,030
我对此并非一无所知
I know nothing about that.

712
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:15,960
嗯
Yeah.

713
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:17,710
一大笔钱
A tidy penny.

714
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,620
还有比这更烈的吗？副警长
You got anything stronger than this, deputy?

715
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,430
没有
No. No, we ain't.

716
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:30,480
哦 你知道的 在密西西比州桑顿市的每个院落都有酒
Oh! You know, in Thornton, Mississippi, there's a joy juice still in every yard.

717
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:36,480
只需要一些谷物和糖 用一只罐蒸煮就行了
Yeah, well, all you need is just some corn, sugar, and a pot to boil it in.

718
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:40,360
我曾试图找老仆人的手印
I tried to take the fingerprints of this old boy one time.

719
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:43,160
他的一生都交给了麦芽浆桶
And he had his hands in a mash barrel all his life.

720
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:46,160
那上面根本就没有手印
You know, there was no skin and all on there. There was no prints.

721
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:49,910
我们对密西西比老仆人的故事没兴趣 安德森
We ain't interested in your good old Mississippi boring stories, Anderson.

722
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,110
- 你在这里不会有更多收获  - 嗯
- You ain't from here no more.  - Mm-hm.

723
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,710
你为什么不走呢？
Why'd you leave, anyway?

724
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,420
我只是想看看风景 你知道…
Well, I just wanted a change of scenery, you know...

725
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:04,720
粗面粉使我口中带有一股怪味道
The grits started leaving a bad taste in my mouth.

726
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:08,000
FBI先生 你既然有如此感受
If that's how you feel about it, Mr. FBI man,

727
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,770
何不喝了这杯酒然后离开这里
why don't you drink up that beer and get the hell on out of here,

728
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:13,730
回北方去找钟情黑人和共产党人的上司？
and back to your Commie, nigger-loving bosses up north?

729
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:16,650
你一定不认识我的上司 胡佛先生
You must not know my boss, Mr. Hoover.

730
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:20,320
他不太喜欢共产党人 他会站在你这一边
He's not too fond of Commies. He'd be on your side there.

731
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:24,360
我不相信两个混蛋和你的胡佛先生立场相同
I don't give two shits whose side your Mr. Hoover's on, boy.

732
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:29,540
这个县有五千黑人没有做选民注册
All I konw is we got 5, 000 niggers in this county who ain't registered to vote yet.

733
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:32,580
我所关心的是他们永远也不会注册
And as far as I'm concerned, they never will.

734
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:36,000
去告诉你们华盛顿自负的上司
So you can tell your stiff suits up there in Washington, D.C.

735
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,340
他们绝对改变不了
that they ain't gonna change us one bit.

736
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:43,700
除非我死 或者大量黑人死亡
Unless it's over my dead body. Or a lot of dead niggers.

737
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,810
你会死？弗兰克 那是你的意思吗？
You'd kill, Frank? Is that what you're saying?

738
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:55,230
这是在扭猫的脖子 不要有更多的想法
I wouldn't give it no more thought than wringing a cat's neck.

739
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,860
密西西比州还没有法庭能证明我有罪
And there ain't no court in Mississippi that'd convict me for it.

740
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:02,900
怎么样？副警长 你怎么理解扭脖子？
How about you, deputy? How are you with wringing necks, huh?

741
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,570
你老是逼我 胡佛男孩
Just keep pushing me, Hoover boy.

742
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:07,990
你还真坦率 笨蛋
You get this straight, you fucker!

743
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,600
告诉你的变态上司
You tell your queer-ass nigger-bosses up north

744
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,290
在这里永远也找不到他们
they ain't never gonna find them civil righters down here.

745
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,200
因此你最好收拾行囊
So you might as well pack up your bags

746
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,650
滚回北方去
and head your ass back up on north where you belong.

747
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:22,100
你还真坦率 笨蛋
You get this straight, shitkicker!

748
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:25,680
别把我看扁了
Don't you go mistaking me for some whoever body.

749
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,400
你要是认为我们要消失 你就是脑残
You got brains in your dick, if you think we're just gonna fade away.

750
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,010
我们将待在这里直至这件事了结
We're gonna be here till this thing's finished.

751
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:35,440
怎么样？副警长
How about you, Deputy?

752
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,110
那支枪只是炫耀吗？
Is that gun just for show?

753
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,780
还是偶尔射过人？
Or do you get to shoot people once in a while?

754
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,950
谢谢啤酒
Thanks for the beer.

755
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:01,800
问问他们是否想保护这个国家
And ask them if they wanna help save this country

756
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,880
免于种族融合的混乱
from the onslaught of integration.

757
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,590
那种体制是想把白人儿童和有色人儿童
You know the system is they want to throw white children and colored children

758
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,600
植入种族融合的熔炉
into the melting pot of integration,

759
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:15,310
将来人种杂交
throughout of which will come a conglomerated

760
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,310
产生黑白混血儿
mulato, mongrel class of people!

761
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:21,860
种族将在这种运动中被毁灭
Both races will be destroyed in such a move.

762
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:27,200
除非上帝消逝 我将屈服
I, for one, under God will die before I'll yield one inch

763
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:30,720
美国的这种运动
to that kind of a movement in America.

764
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,290
你知道你引起的麻烦吗？
Do you know how much trouble you've caused?

765
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,500
他们整天在电台
They've been on the radio all day,

766
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,900
从汤利到州长 每一个人都在谈FBI威吓
everyone from Townley to the Governor talking about FBI intimidation.

767
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,210
安德森先生 我们不是暴徒 这件事要按我的方式办
We're not thugs, Mr. Anderson. We're gonna do this thing my way!

768
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:44,820
我知道 按局程序嘛
I know, bureau procedure.

769
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,420
你为什么在美容店？
And what the hell were you doing at the beauty parlor?

770
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:51,000
是局里的事 我应该知道
If that was Bureau business, I wanna know about it.

771
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,080
不是的话 我不允许 明白吗？
If it wasn't, I won't allow it. Do you understand me? !

772
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:54,390
进来
Get in here!

773
01:02:56,850 --> 01:02:58,690
你知道你的问题吗？
You know what your problem is?

774
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,360
你不懂何时开口 何时闭嘴 这使你成了一个傻瓜
You don't know when to speak and when to shut up! That makes you a fool.

775
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:06,530
佩尔太太什么也不会说 她丈夫不想她说
Mrs. Pell ain't gonna say anything to me her husband doesn't want her to say.

776
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:08,700
我不会让她这么压抑
Now, I'm not gonna choke it out!

777
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:13,240
这个棘手的问题只可从内心入手
This can of worms only opens from the inside.

778
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,040
我知道
I know that.

779
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:32,760
自由
Freedom!

780
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,500
白人黑人
White nigger!

781
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:44,730
白人黑人
White nigger!

782

Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

784
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:05,990
二十分？
20 cents?

785
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:13,170
自由 自由 自由
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

786
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:18,380
♫ 肩负 ♫

- Hi.  - Hey, now.

791
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,550
只是路过 来问声好
Just passing by, just saying hello.

792
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:55,080
你没去看游行？
You're not out watching the parade?

793
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,970
你怎么不问我问题？
Say, how come none of you guys didn't ask me any questions?

794
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:59,640
好像这这镇子的人都不和我谈
It seems everybody in town has been talked to except me.

795
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:06,810
你怎么不叫些英俊的FBI男孩来？
Why don't you send some of them good-looking FBI boys to talk to me?

796
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:10,480
很抱歉打扰了 我在五金商店…
Sorry about the intrusion. I was over at the hardware store and...

797
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:12,850
山核桃？
Pecan?

798
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:14,400
我讨厌山核桃
I'm sick of pecans.

799
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:17,370
自由 自由
Freedom!

800
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:20,260
你们决心起来抗争吗？
You willing to stand up and fight?

801
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:21,750
是的
Yes!

802
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:39,550
自由
Freedom!

803
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:45,850
平等
Equality!

804
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,700
你打算怎么查？
How'd you find out about this?

805
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:01,600
按局程序 沃德先生
Bureau procedure, Mr. Ward.

806
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:15,220
斯塔基警长
Sheriff Stuckey.

807
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,970
他有电话
He got his phone call.

808
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:23,010
真想知道是谁打的
Wonder who else was called.

809
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,770
你要去那里？
Where're you going, boy?

810
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,150
快走吧 快走吧 离开这里
Go on. Go on, get out of here.

811
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,080
他们来了
Here they come.

812
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:58,300
走吧
Come on. Let's go.

813
01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:00,760
等他们回屋里
We'll wait until they go back inside.

814
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,080
抓住他
Get him!

815
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,730
把他弄上车
Get him in the truck now!

816
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:12,150
进屋里去呀 婊子养的
Get inside, you sons of bitches!

817
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,680
快点 走吧
Come on, let's go. Come on!

818
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:17,440
- 等他们回屋里  - 走吧 快点
- Wait until they go back inside!  - Let's go! Come on!

819
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,120
走吧 快点
Come on! Let's go! Come on!

820
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:27,100
快
Come on!

821
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:36,690
- 向左拐  - 你怎么知道？
- Turn left.  - How do you know?

822
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:38,230
我不知道 向左拐
I don't. Just turn left.

823
01:08:42,450 --> 01:08:44,030
是那卡车
There's the truck.

824
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:46,620
上那条小路
Go up that little road there.

825
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:52,540
停车 停车 就停在这
Stop, stop. Stop right here.

826
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,740
这些人怎么了？
What's wrong with these people?

827
01:09:39,130 --> 01:09:44,260
沃克太太 我知道你很为难 但我需要你的帮助
Mrs. Walker, I know this is difficult for you, but I really need your help.

828
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:48,180
你只要说服你儿子出来指控
If you could just persuade your son to press charges,

829
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:51,760
我们就能立刻拘捕副警长
then we could pick up the deputy at least right away.

830
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:54,270
他不会对任何人说
He won't talk to no one.

831
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,380
总之没有用的
And it won't do no good anyway.

832
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,310
我保证会拘捕
I promise it will.

833
01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:00,610
别理他了
Leave him alone.

834
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:03,530
但愿也别打扰我们
Maybe then, they'll let us alone.

835
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:17,620
如果这是一个范例
If this is a pattern,

836
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:21,670
就能猜测六月二十一日发生了什么
I guess at least we know what happened on June 21st.

837
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,470
佩尔在下午三时扣留了三名超速行驶的男孩
Pell stopped the three boys for speeding at 3 o'clock.

838
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:28,800
将他们监禁 直到三K党组织好
He held them in jail until the Klan could get organized.

839
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:31,050
然后在十点半释放
Then he released them at 10:30.

840
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,600
那时 他的伙伴已在等待
And by that time, his buddies were ready and waiting.

841
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:36,540
不 那晚佩尔肯定去了
No, Deputy Pell went with them that night.

842
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,140
你认为他撒谎？
I'm sure of it. You think he'll crack?

843
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:41,650
人们说响尾蛇不会自取灭亡
Down here they say rattlesnakes don't commit suicide.

844
01:10:51,410 --> 01:10:54,700
副警长佩尔 你放了三个民权工作者
Deputy Pell, did you release the three civil rights workers

845
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:58,000
交给三K党 就在六月二十一日晚上
into the hands of the Klan on the night of June 21st?

846
01:10:58,290 --> 01:10:59,400
没有
No.

847
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,500
你是三K党成员吗？
Are you yourself a member of the Ku Klux Klan?

848
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,670
不是
No.

849
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:05,600
你曾经是吗？
Have you ever been a member of the Ku Klux Klan?

850
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:06,670
不是
No.

851
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:09,990
熟悉独眼巨人吗？
Are you familiar with the term Grand Cyclops?

852
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:11,620
听说过
I've heard of it.

853
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:15,830
事实上过去三年来 你是
Were you in fact the Grand Cyclops of the East Mississippi Klavern

854
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:19,170
三K党白骑士团的独眼巨人？
of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan for the past three years?

855
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:23,230
反对 我的委托人已说过他甚至不是三K党成员
Objection. My client's already told you he's not even a member of the Klan.

856
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:28,400
反对？这只是面谈 没有必要这么正式吧
Objection? This is just an interview, sir. There's really no need to be so formal.

857
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:31,570
只是面谈的话 我不必呆在这里 是吧？
Well, if this is just an interview, I guess I don't have to stay here, do I?

858
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:33,700
我有事要做
I got work to do.

859
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,370
我想你也有事要做？
I guess you do too, don't you?

860
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:41,710
没错 你相信我们会做
Yes, sir. And you can be sure that we'll do it.

861
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:43,710
祝你好运
Good luck.

862
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:48,420
你们要指控我 就知道去哪里查我
You get enough to indict me, you know where to find me.

863
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:54,220
- 怎么样？ - 没事
- How'd it go?  - Fine. It went just fine.

864
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:56,760
别担心那些该死的事
Don't you worry about a goddamn thing.

865
01:11:58,150 --> 01:11:59,770
你会被指控吗？
Are you gonna be indicted?

866
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:02,480
FBI有指控警长办公室的证据吗？
Does the FBI have evidence that the Sheriff's office is invovled?

867
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:04,880
你与他们合作吗？
Are you cooperating in this investigation?

868
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:07,000
我们一惯合作
We're cooperating just like we have all along.

869
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:08,800
毫无证据可言
They have no damn evidence either. It's all circumstancial.

870
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:13,570
先生 请不要拍摄
Sir, could you not do that, please? Sir, do not do that, please!

871
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,280
已经告诉你了 现在 给我滚开
Don't you understand? Now, get the fuck out of here!

872
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,850
要告诉你两千次吗？
We have to tell you two thousand times?

873
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,250
从哪来滚哪去
Now get out of here and go back where you belong!

874
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:26,250
在我面前消失
Get out of my face, boy!

875
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,210
滚开 别打扰我们
Get on out and leave us alone!

876
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,600
别打扰我们
Leave us alone!

877
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:34,140
从哪来滚哪去 你找揍呀
Go on home where you belong! Boy, you're gonna get hurt now.

878
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,850
沃德先生 此事我们勉强能接受
Mr. Ward, this is getting to be just about as much as we can take.

879
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:41,550
可我无法表达更强的怨言
I cannot register my complaints more strongly.

880
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,710
现在无法 先生
Not now, sir.

881
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:43,810
现在 你只有一分钟
Now, you just a minute.

882
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:47,820
我对公众追逐我的警长处很不满意
I resent your public pursuit of my Sheriff's department.

883
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:51,530
你在竭尽所能将他们牵涉进这些失踪案
You have made every effort to implicate them in these disappearances.

884
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:54,700
含沙射影并不能证明
But your goddamn slimey innuendos are not evidence

885
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:56,450
他们涉及任何罪行
that they were any way connected with any crime.

886
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:59,410
我们正在设法发掘真相 但有阻碍
We're just trying to get to the truth. It's frustrating for us too!

887
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:02,960
任何傻瓜可以出来指控 沃德 但那不是证据
Anyone jackass can point a finger, Ward. Now, that ain't evidence.

888
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:07,130
在这里 旧棉花间苗机的使用者们还会蠢得去相信民主
Down here, us old cotton-choppers are still stupid enough to believe in democracy.

889
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:10,670
我们要懂得按法律行使权利
And you can rest assured, sir, we know our rights under the law!

890
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,760
你知道就好 我用一台棉花间苗机来打赌
You know something all right. I'll bet a cotton-chopping dollar on that.

891
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:17,400
你知道吗 安德森 你越来越咄咄逼人
You know what, Anderson? You're starting to get so far up my nose,

892
01:13:17,450 --> 01:13:19,680
我开始觉得你在威胁我
I'm beginning to feel your boots on my chin.

893
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:23,100
我再次告诉你
And I'm telling you one more time, Mr. apple-red,

894
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,500
几个披着床单的疯子
a couple of crazies dressed in bed sheets

895
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:28,000
在乡下跳舞来吓唬黑人
dancing around the countryside scaring Negroes

896
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:30,800
不是整个密西西比州的错
is not the goddamn fault of the entire state of Mississippi!

897
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:33,820
我告诉你 提尔曼 有三个孩子死亡
I'm telling you, Tilman, there are three dead kids out there somewhere,

898
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:36,680
很多人害怕 这都是因为你的警长处
and a lot of scared people because of your goddamn Sheriff's department.

899
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:38,530
大家要相互体谅
So you better get used to having us around.

900
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:42,160
也体谅我威胁你
And you better get used to my boots on your chin too.

901
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,580
你们最好放弃
You people better back off!

902
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,790
该死的FBI 自以为是
Goddamn FBI! Just who on hell do they think they are?

903
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,530
敢来我的地盘…
Coming down on my part of the goddamn country harassing...

904
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:51,840
市长先生 你有要说的吗？
Do you have a statement, Mr. Mayor?

905
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:53,800
该死的我当然有
You got goddamn right I got a statement!

906
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:56,220
安德森先生 刚才
For a moment there, Mr. Anderson,

907
01:13:57,010 --> 01:14:00,460
我们彼此立场相同
it sounded like we were both on the same side.

908
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,280
宝贝 你好吗？
Are you all right, honey?

909
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:30,540
我很好
Yeah, I'm fine.

910
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:32,150
有什么就叫我
Let me know if you need anything.

911
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:34,130
谢谢 我会的
Thanks, I will.

912
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,300
妈妈 快来
Mama, Mama, come quick!

913
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:19,890
没有他的踪迹 他离开很久了
There's no sign of him, sir. He's long gone.

914
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:23,720
他母亲住在街对面 她可能不会开门
His mother, she lives across the street. She won't talk to us. Won't even answer the door.

915
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:27,290
我想整个区一定有人看见了
I want the whole area covered. Someone must have seen something.

916
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:28,730
他们不会说 先生
They won't talk to us, sir.

917
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:33,000
伯德先生 走吧 如果他们不说 就摆脱不了
Get going, Mr. Bird. If they won't talk to us, shake it out of them.

918
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,630
好吧 我们走 去每个住宅 快点
All right, let's go. Every house. Come on.

919
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:46,680
怎么？
What?

920
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:51,390
这些白人会四处销毁痕迹
Sending all these white guys chasing around these dog tracks with their little notebooks

921
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,380
你将一无所获
is gonna get you nowhere.

922
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:56,270
你能做什么？
Okay. What would you do?

923
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:02,860
可以害怕
It's okay to be afraid.

924
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:12,910
快点 威利
Go on, Willie.

925
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:15,540
告诉他们
Tell them what you saw.

926
01:17:49,370 --> 01:17:51,370
被告站起来
The defendants will rise.

927
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:58,580
在这个国家 一个人的家就是他的避难所
In this country, a man's home is his castle.

928
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:04,090
那是这个社会生存的一个原则
That is one of the principles by which this community survives.

929
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:07,300
你们已经破坏了这个原则
You men have done violence to that principle.

930
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:11,000
但我要你们知道 法庭了解
But I want you to know that the court understands

931
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:12,720
你们已经犯的罪
that the crimes that you have comitted

932
01:18:12,930 --> 01:18:14,730
至少在某种程度上
have been, to some extent at least,

933
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:18,670
是受外来影响
brought about by outside influences.

934
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:34,660
外人已经进入杰瑟普县 他们是道德卑贱的人
Outsiders have come into Jessup County and they've been people of low morality.

935
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:37,960
不洁净的人
And unhygienic.

936
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:41,590
他们的存在激怒了许多人
And their presence here has provoked a lot of people.

937
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:50,370
因此法庭了解 没有宽恕他们 请注意
So the court understands, without condoning them, mind you,

938
01:18:50,470 --> 01:18:55,140
你们已经承认有罪的 至少在某种程度上
that the crimes to which you men have pled guilty were, to some extent at least,

939
01:18:56,020 --> 01:18:59,770
是这些外来影响引起的
provoked by these outside influences.

940
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:04,980
鉴于所有一切 我将从轻处罚你们
So with all this, I'm gonna make your punishment light.

941
01:19:06,990 --> 01:19:10,320
我打算判你们每人五年监禁
I'm gonna sentence you each to five years imprisonment.

942
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:18,400
但我要延缓判决
But I'm gonna suspend these sentences.

943
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:54,030
你们不能进去 先生
You can't go in there, sir.

944
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:56,850
FBI 让我们进去
FBI. Let us through.

945
01:19:56,950 --> 01:19:59,080
抱歉 你们不能进去
I'm sorry, sir. You can't go in there.

946
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:06,130
警长
Sheriff!

947
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,430
你们真的在进行一些事
You started something this time.

948
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:15,050
车让开 我要进去和他们谈
Can you move these cars? I wanna go in there and talk to them.

949
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:16,790
你去 只要你能去
No, you're gone as far as you're gonna go.

950
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:18,720
我们能处理
This ain't nothing we can't handle.

951
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:21,590
只是一些疯狂的有色人挖开了自己的屁眼
Just a bunch of crazy coloreds tearing up their own assholes.

952
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:23,440
地方问题
Local problem.

953
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:41,410
沃德先生 瞧那火
Look at those flames, Mr. Ward.

954
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:44,830
那就是他们要你来的原因 是吗？
That's why they sent you down here, wasn't it?

955
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,630
你知道的 总之发生了
It would've happened anyway and you know it.

956
01:20:49,210 --> 01:20:53,010
我要是黑人 我可能会用同样的方式
You know, if I was a Negro, I'd probably think the same way they do.

957
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:54,700
你要是黑人
If you were a Negro,

958
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:58,010
没人会在乎你的想法
nobody would give a damn what you thought.

959
01:21:54,650 --> 01:21:56,700
亚伦 亚伦 起来
Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, get up!

No one knows why. They're just stupid, I guess.

988
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:46,200
它们站那里直到吃饱喝足
They just stand there until their bellies swell up and they pop.

989
01:24:46,530 --> 01:24:48,950
他们有亲戚在底特律
They have relatives in Detroit.

我没给他们任何选择
I didn't give them any choice.

992
01:24:55,170 --> 01:24:57,210
至少我们知道谁干的
At least, we know who did this.

993
01:24:58,170 --> 01:24:59,610
是我们
We did.

994
01:24:59,710 --> 01:25:01,410
别烦躁 会有进展
Don't fret. It's progress.

995
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:04,930
二十年前他们对偷西瓜的都要吊死
Twenty years ago, they'd strung them up for stealing watermelons.

996
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:10,100
我不明白 安德森先生 根本没有这种事
I don't understand you, Mr. Anderson. Not at all.

997
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:13,020
我们坦诚一点吧
Let's get something straight, all right?

998
01:25:13,230 --> 01:25:17,500
此事情经新闻报道就被弄糟了
This whole thing was fucked up the moment we turned it into a show for the newsmen.

999
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,300
三个孩子失踪就是新闻
The moment these three kids disappeared, it was news.

1000
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:24,450
三个民权工作者失踪就是新闻
The moment the three civil rights workers disappeared, it was news.

1001
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:27,780
他们只是孩子 至今下落不明
To me they're just kids. They're still missing.

1002
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:32,700
佩尔说跟他妻子一起五十分钟
What's missing is the 50 minutes Pell said he was with his wife.

1003

行
Okay.

1004
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:55,730
我爱密西西比州
I love Mississippi.

1005
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:09,300
他们…
They...

1006
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:11,580
他们不喜欢密西西比州
They hate Mississippi.

1007
01:26:12,830 --> 01:26:15,160
他们恨我们是因为我们做了
They hate us, because we present

1008
01:26:15,370 --> 01:26:20,090
种族隔离的辉煌典范
a shining example of successful segregation.

1009
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:24,760
这些北方学生 与他们的无神论者 共产主义上司
These northern students, with their atheist, Communist bosses,

1010
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:28,800
今年夏天进入我们社区妄图摧毁这个典范
that have come into our community this summer with the wish to destroy it,

1011
01:26:29,010 --> 01:26:33,180
本周已采取了可怕的打击
this week, have taken a terrible blow.

1012
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:37,190
他们的企图破灭了
This week, their cause has been crippled.

1013
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:40,800
本周 这些联邦警察在窥探我们的生活
This week, all of these federal policemen you see out here

1014
01:26:40,850 --> 01:26:44,000
侵犯我们公民的自由
prying into our lives violating our civil beliefs

1015
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:47,110
据了解 他们无力反对我们
have learned that they are powerless against us,

1016
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:51,450
每个盎格鲁撒克逊基督徒
if every single Anglo-Saxon Christian one of us

1017
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:52,780
与我们站在一起
stands together!

1018
01:26:58,170 --> 01:26:59,500
本周…
This week...

1019
01:27:00,630 --> 01:27:03,420
- 沃德？ - 有客人
- Mr. Ward?  - We got company, sir.

1020
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:06,630
你为何在此？这是政治性集会
You got no right to be here. This is a political meeting.

1021
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,450
我并没感到这种气氛 副警长
Doesn't smell that way to me, Deputy.

1022
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:10,470
这是政治性集会 胡佛男孩
It's a goddamn political meeting, Hoover boy!

1023
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:16,560
是象政治性集会 但气氛更象三K党
Oh, it looks like a political meeting, but smells more like Klan to me.

1024
01:27:16,810 --> 01:27:19,980
不管有没有穿万圣节服装
With or without the Halloween costumes.

1025
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:22,310
先生们
Gentlemen.

1026
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:26,190
在密西西比州法庭 已经提醒他们
In the courts of Mississippi, they have been reminded

1027
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:32,120
他们不能凭借武力将我们社区变成他们社区的摹本
that they cannot by force turn our communities into relicas of their communities.

1028
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:36,660
社区里黑人闹事没受限制 没受处罚
Communities in which Negroes run riot, unrestrained and unpunished

1029
01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:39,210
今年夏天在哈莱姆街道
as they do this summer in the streets of Harlem,

1030
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:41,080
奥克兰街道
or they do in the streets of Oakland,

1031
01:27:41,290 --> 01:27:43,340
芝加哥街道等地都有闹事
or they do in the streets of Chicago!

1032
01:29:04,630 --> 01:29:06,420
能进去吗？
Can I come in?

1033
01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:17,140
来这里对你没有益处
It's not good for you to be here.

1034
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:18,760
为什么？
Why?

1035
01:29:18,970 --> 01:29:20,560
丑恶
It's ugly.

1036
01:29:20,890 --> 01:29:23,730
整件事非常丑恶
This whole thing is so ugly.

1037
01:29:24,230 --> 01:29:27,770
接受这一切会象什么？
Have you any idea what it's like to live with all this?

1038
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:33,860
人们看我们 只看到顽固分子和种族主义者
People look at us and only see bigots and racists.

1039
01:29:35,570 --> 01:29:38,370
仇恨并不是天生的
Hatred isn't something you're born with.

1040
01:29:38,830 --> 01:29:40,790
是教导的
It gets taught.

1041
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:46,880
在学校他们说种族隔离圣经里有
At school, they said segregation's what said in the Bible.

1042
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:52,710
创世纪九章 二十七节
Genesis 9, verse 27.

1043
01:29:54,970 --> 01:29:57,180
七岁时
At seven years of age,

1044
01:29:57,390 --> 01:30:00,970
就被告之 就相信
you get told it enough times, you believe it.

1045
01:30:01,970 --> 01:30:04,140
相信仇恨
You believe the hatred.

1046
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:09,480
经历仇恨 发出仇恨
You live it. You breathe it.

1047
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:13,360
嫁给仇恨
You marry it.

1048
01:30:43,430 --> 01:30:46,210
那晚我丈夫驾驶其中一辆车
My husband drove one of the cars that night.

1049
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:50,520
- 嘘  - 这就是你想知道的 不是吗？
- Shh  - That's what you wanted to hear, isn't it?

1050
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:54,860
尸体被埋在罗伯茨农场
The bodies are buried on the Roberts' Farm

1051
01:30:55,070 --> 01:30:57,530
一个土坝里
in an earthen dam.

1052
01:31:15,170 --> 01:31:16,760
长官
Sir.

1053
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:31,690
休息一下 伯德先生
Take a break, Mr. Bird.

1054
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:34,820
用手绢擦擦脸
Put some handkerchiefs around your faces.

1055
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:08,270
今天下午发现三个民权工作者的尸体
The bodies of the three missing civil rights workers were discovered this afternoon

1056
01:32:08,430 --> 01:32:10,100
是在一座未公开的墓地
at an undisclosed grave.

1057
01:32:12,230 --> 01:32:16,400
FBI和警长处都未对此事作评论
Neither the FBI nor the Sheriff's department will comment on the case.

1058
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:19,530
尸体被带到杰瑟普县医院
The bodies have been brought here to Jessup County Hospital,

1059
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:21,740
官方也拒绝发表评论
where officials have also refused to comment.

1060
01:32:21,950 --> 01:32:26,450
据猜测验尸工作将于今晚稍后进行
There is speculation that there will be an autopsy performed later tonight.

1061
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:30,290
让开
Keep it open.

1062
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:33,540
让开路 我们要过去 让开路
Open it up. Coming through. Open it up.

1063

你教我

1113
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:17,000
你没有胆量
You don't have the guts.

1114
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:19,850
我不但有胆量 我还有权力
Not only do I have the guts, I have the authority!

1115
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:22,000

1116
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:23,770
新规则
New rules.

1117
01:36:23,980 --> 01:36:27,320
按我们的方式起诉他们 也是你的方式
We nail them any way we can. Even your way.

1118
01:36:27,530 --> 01:36:29,970
这是你说的还是有些家伙在暗中操纵你？
Is this you talking or some guy's pulling your strings, huh?

1119
01:36:30,070 --> 01:36:31,740
两者
Both.

1120
01:36:32,490 --> 01:36:34,900
- 我们按我的方式做  - 你的方式
- We do it my way!  - Your way.

1121
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,950

1122
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:40,790

1123
01:36:47,170 --> 01:36:48,960
给我一分钟
Give me a minute.

1124
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:58,620
你认为他会向我开枪吗？
You think he would have shot me?

1125
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:00,270
会 长官
Oh, yes, sir.

1126
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:03,730
他是一个有种的小混蛋
He's a ballsy little bastard, isn't he?

1127
01:37:11,740 --> 01:37:16,810
他们想要我说“我们不要忘记那两个白人男孩也死于
They want me to say let us not forget that two white boys also died

1128
01:37:16,910 --> 01:37:19,540

1129
01:37:22,410 --> 01:37:24,120
他们想要我说

1130
01:37:24,330 --> 01:37:28,590
“我们与两个白人男孩的母亲一起悲痛”
we mourn with the mothers of these two white boys.

1131
01:37:31,090 --> 01:37:33,130
但是密西西比州
But the State of Mississippi

1132
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:39,390
甚至不许这两个白人男孩与那个黑人男孩葬在相同的公墓里
won't even allow these white boys to be buried in the same cemetery as this Negro boy.

1133
01:37:41,810 --> 01:37:46,270
我没有更多的爱奉献
I say, I have no more love to give.

1134
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:53,030
今天 我心中只有怒火 我想要你们和我一起愤怒
I have only anger in my heart today, and I want you to be angry with me!

1135
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:58,910
现在 我烦恼 我厌倦 我想要你们和我一起烦恼 厌倦
I am sick, and I am tired, and I want you to be sick and tired with me!

1136
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:04,540
我烦恼 我厌倦参加黑人的葬礼
I am sick and tired of going to the funerals of black men,

1137

我烦恼 我厌倦这片国土的人民
I am sick and tired of the people of this country,

1139
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:15,380
他们继续纵容着这些事的发生
who continue to allow these things to happen.

1140
01:38:15,590 --> 01:38:20,140
如果你是一个黑人 什么是“不可剥夺的权利”？
What is an "unalienable right", if you are a Negro?

1141
01:38:20,350 --> 01:38:23,730
什么是“依法获得平等待遇”？
What does it mean "equal treatment under the law"?

1142
01:38:23,930 --> 01:38:29,190
什么是“自由和公平”？
What does it mean "liberty and justice for all"?

1143
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:34,320
我对这些人说 看这个年轻人的脸
Now I say to these people, look at the face of this young young man

1144
01:38:34,530 --> 01:38:37,610
你将看到一个黑人的脸
and you will see the face of a black man.

1145
01:38:37,820 --> 01:38:40,660
如果你看那鲜血 是红的
But if you look at the blood shed, it is red!

1146
01:38:40,830 --> 01:38:45,370
就象你的 和你的一样
It is like yours! It is just like yours!

1147
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:15,920
你…
You...

1148
01:40:19,170 --> 01:40:21,800
我说一个故事
I'm gonna tell you a story.

1149
01:40:22,930 --> 01:40:27,720
一个叫霍默·威尔克斯的孩子住在离这以北三十里
A young kid named Homer Wilkes, lives about 30 miles north of here.

1150
01:40:28,350 --> 01:40:33,230
他带着他的女友回家 正沿着道路往回走
He'd just taken his girlfriend home and was walking back along the road,

1151
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:35,770
一辆汽车停下来
when a car pulled up.

1152
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:40,110
三个白人男孩把他抓上车
Three white boys took him for a ride.

1153
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:44,950
然而
Now,

1154
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:48,620
他没做任何事情
he hadn't done anything

1155
01:40:50,330 --> 01:40:51,500
只不过
except

1156
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:55,630
是一个黑人
be a Negro.

1157
01:40:58,170 --> 01:41:00,380
他们带他到一间小屋
And they took him to a shack.

1158
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:04,800
象这样的一间小屋
A shack like this one.

1159
01:41:04,970 --> 01:41:07,310
他们取出一块刀片
They took out a razor blade.

1160
01:41:08,220 --> 01:41:11,600
象这样的一块平常的旧刀片
Regular razor blade like this one.

1161
01:41:14,020 --> 01:41:17,190
他们扯开他的裤子
They pulled down his pants,

1162
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:22,320
分开他的腿
they spread his legs

1163
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:26,990
切掉他的阴囊
and they sliced off his scrotum.

1164
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:32,500
放进一个咖啡杯
Put it in a coffee cup.

1165
01:41:37,210 --> 01:41:42,500
你知道切断你的阴囊会出多少血吗？
Do you know how much you bleed when somebody cuts off your balls?

1166
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:44,400
啊？
Huh? !

1167
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:49,890
人们找到霍默时 他们说
When they found Homer they said he looked like

1168
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:53,560
他的腰以下就象被浸在血液中
he'd been dipped in blood up to his waist.

1169
01:41:53,810 --> 01:41:57,190
人们把他送到医院时 他还勉强活着
He was barely alive when they got him to the hospital.

1170
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:59,820
现在他几乎不能行走
He can hardly walk now.

1171
01:42:09,870 --> 01:42:12,910
市长 我们知道你清楚
Mayor, we know you know who was there

1172
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:16,040
三个民权男孩被杀害时 谁在场
when those three civil rights boys were murdered.

1173
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:19,250
我们知道你清楚谁扣了扳机
We know you know who pulled the trigger.

1174
01:42:25,090 --> 01:42:27,590
还有什么要说的吗？
Is there something you wanna say to me?

1175
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:35,730
好了
Okay.

1176
01:42:40,820 --> 01:42:42,890
他与调查局一致吗？
Is he with the Bureau?

1177
01:42:42,990 --> 01:42:45,070
嗯 他相当于一位专家
Yeah, he's kind of a specialist.

1178
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:46,760
你相信市长不会讲吗？
You're sure the mayor won't talk about any of this?

1179
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:48,320
不会 他们会杀了他
No, they'd kill him.

1180
01:42:48,530 --> 01:42:50,770
- 好吧 有什么收获？ - 额…
- All right, what do you have?  - Well...

1181
01:42:50,870 --> 01:42:53,200
三辆车 七个人
It was three cars, seven men involved.

1182
01:42:53,410 --> 01:42:54,650
佩尔和贝利开的枪
Pell and Bailey, they did the killing.

1183
01:42:54,750 --> 01:42:55,910
斯塔基警长呢？
Sheriff Stuckey?

1184
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:59,500
他太精明了 所以没去 因此佩尔为他扣扳机
He knew about it, but he's too smart to be there. So Pell pulled the trigger for him.

1185
01:42:59,790 --> 01:43:00,900
汤利呢？
And Townley?

1186
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,090
是他的主意
It was his idea.

1187
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:04,590
巨龙们不能脏了手
Grand Dragons, they don't get their hands dirty.

1188
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:08,930
整个事情 哼？核心的核心
The whole thing, huh? Bullet by bullet.

1189
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:12,300
我不认为你会对
I don't suppose you're interested in words like

1190
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:16,270
“强制” “谣言” “胁迫”感兴趣
coercion or hearsay or duress?

1191
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,840
这在法庭没用
This is no good in court.

1192
01:43:18,940 --> 01:43:20,730
我们不在法庭 沃德先生
We're not in court, Mr. Ward.

1193
01:43:20,940 --> 01:43:24,820
绝不会因谋杀起诉他们 我们要公诉
We'll never get them on murder anyway. That's a state charge.

1194
01:43:25,030 --> 01:43:28,000
- 那些乡巴佬绝不会起诉  - 我知道
- These hastings will never prosecute.  - I know that.

1195
01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:29,950
必须在联邦法庭起诉他们
Well, we've got to pick them in Federal Court.

1196
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:31,520
侵犯公民权利
Violation of civil rights!

1197
01:43:31,620 --> 01:43:34,120
不要忘记你在侵犯谁的权利
Just don't lose sight of whose rights are violated!

1198
01:43:34,290 --> 01:43:36,110
别把我与你扯在一起 沃德先生
Don't put me on your perch, Mr. Ward!

1199
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:38,120
别把我扯进你的阴沟里 安德森先生
Don't drag me into your gutter, Mr. Anderson!

1200
01:43:38,290 --> 01:43:41,130
这些人爬出了阴沟 沃德先生
These people crawled out of the sewer, Mr. Ward!

1201
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:44,000
或许我们应该在阴沟
Maybe the gutter's where we should be!

1202
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:51,340
谢谢
Thank you.

1203
01:44:15,330 --> 01:44:17,410
要抓紧
This better be important.

1204
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,710
究竟谁召集会议？
Who the hell called this meeting?

1205
01:44:31,050 --> 01:44:32,510
我们以为是你
We thought you did.

1206
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:34,760
聚会吗？你是笨蛋？
Of this group? Are you stupid?

1207
01:44:34,970 --> 01:44:36,810
你没召集？
You didn't call this?

1208
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:39,400
混蛋 不是你 又是谁？
Shit! Then if you didn't call this, who the fuck did?

1209
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:41,200
- 闭嘴  - 现在 等一下
- Shut up!  - Now, wait a minute!

1210
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:43,480
这是某种骗局？
Is this some kind of a bullshit setup?

1211
01:44:43,690 --> 01:44:45,730
雷 你确定你没有召集？
Ray, you're sure you didn't call this?

1212
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:49,530
我从我妻子那里得到消息 说是你和克林顿说的
Because I got a note from my wife and it said it was from you and Clinton.

1213
01:44:49,990 --> 01:44:51,500
莱斯特 闭嘴
Lester, shut up!

1214
01:44:53,910 --> 01:44:58,200
现在 我们全都出去
Now, we're all gonna walk straight out of here

1215
01:44:58,410 --> 01:45:00,410
什么也别说
and say nothing.

1216
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:02,870
那意味着什么 莱斯特
That means nothing, Lester.

1217
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:04,740
就是第一个开口的会死
First one who opens his mouth is a dead man.

1218
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:06,420
闭嘴
Shut up!

1219
01:45:07,250 --> 01:45:09,010
嘿 克林顿
Hey, Clinton.

1220
01:45:12,630 --> 01:45:14,390
克林顿
Clinton?

1221
01:45:17,850 --> 01:45:21,600
看起来象响尾蛇开始自相残杀
It looks like the rattlesnakes are starting to commit suicide.

1222
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:51,090
喂 莱斯特
Hi, Lester.

1223
01:45:56,510 --> 01:45:58,510
我们带你回家
We'll give you that ride home.

1224
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:01,670
什么？
What?

1225
01:46:01,770 --> 01:46:03,150
你说四点半
Well, I know you said 4:30,

1226
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:05,230
但是我们晚了一点 因此…
but we're running a little late, so...

1227
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:07,760
车上见
I'll meet you in the car.

1228
01:46:07,860 --> 01:46:09,650
你疯了
You're cracked.

1229
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:13,100
你有二十分零钱吗？
You have change for a $20?

1230
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:15,610
有
Sure.

1231
01:46:21,410 --> 01:46:23,330
莱斯特 去车上
Get in the car, Lester.

1232
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:25,850
你很难挖鼻孔了
Else you're gonna have a real hard time picking your nose

1233
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:27,460
一旦我关了这个抽屉
once I've close this drawer shut.

1234
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:35,760
莱斯特 你自己说出来 事情就简单了
Lester, you could make it a whole lot easier on yourself by going on the record right now.

1235
01:46:35,970 --> 01:46:38,260
无可奉告
I ain't got nothing to say.

1236
01:46:38,470 --> 01:46:41,390
你搞错了 先生
You're barking up the wrong tree, mister.

1237
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:44,100
莱斯特 我告诉你
Lester, I've got to tell you something.

1238
01:46:44,310 --> 01:46:48,190
你的同伙都已经说了
We've got you cold. Your buddies've already talked.

1239
01:46:49,610 --> 01:46:51,320
你说谎
You're lying.

1240
01:46:56,490 --> 01:46:58,200
你有很多麻烦 莱斯特
You're in a lot of trouble, Lester.

1241
01:46:58,410 --> 01:47:02,580
我们知道你驾驶第二辆车 绿色卡车
We know you drove the second vehicle, the green truck.

1242
01:47:02,790 --> 01:47:04,910
你的同伙说 我回忆下 伯德先生
And your buddy says, refresh my memory here, Mr. Bird.

1243
01:47:05,120 --> 01:47:08,170
是 先生“莱斯特·考恩斯把黑人从车上拖下来
Yes, sir. "Lester Cowens dragged the Negro from the car,

1244
01:47:08,330 --> 01:47:09,830
踢了他两下 然后开枪打死他”
"kicked him twice in the face and then shot him."

1245
01:47:10,040 --> 01:47:11,570
这是他妈的谎言
That's a goddman lie!

1246
01:47:11,670 --> 01:47:13,500
是真的 伯德先生 还有什么？
No, it's true. What else you've got in there, Mr. Bird?

1247
01:47:13,670 --> 01:47:18,550
“莱斯特·考恩斯说‘只留下黑鬼 至少我射了黑鬼’”
"Lester Cowens then said, 'They only left me a nigger, but at least I shot me a nigger.'"

1248
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:24,470
我没有杀死他 我是朝他屁股开枪
I didn't kill him. I only shot him in the ass.

1249
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:28,310
我们知道 你开枪时 他已经死
We know that. He was already dead by the time you put a slug in him.

1250
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:32,820
但你的同伙不这么认为 你他们认为是你杀的
But your buddy sees it differently. Your buddy tells it that you killed the kid.

1251
01:47:33,020 --> 01:47:35,230
你是投案自首
Now either you go on the record for us right now,

1252
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:39,160
还是不只是朝黑人孩子的屁股开枪
or it's gonna be your ass we're talking about, not just a black kid's!

1253
01:47:53,210 --> 01:47:55,170
好好想一想 莱斯特
Think about it, Lester.

1254
01:47:55,590 --> 01:47:57,050
出去吧
Come on out of there.

1255
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:00,550
去吧
Come on out.

1256
01:48:44,510 --> 01:48:46,600
真要技巧
This is tricky.

1257
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:50,940
看起来那么容易 不是吗？
They make it look so easy, don't they?

1258
01:48:51,730 --> 01:48:54,270
克林顿 我有一个问题
I got a question for you, Clinton.

1259
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:58,440
叫你克林顿 不介意吧？
You don't mind if I call you Clinton, do you?

1260
01:48:58,650 --> 01:49:01,360
我想我非常了解你
I feel like I know you so well.

1261
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:07,160
在凶杀的那晚
The way we have it, on the night of the murders,

1262
01:49:07,370 --> 01:49:11,290
在坝上推土机掩埋那些孩子时 你讲了一句话
you made a short speech as the bulldozer buried the kids in the dam.

1263
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:15,380
莱斯特怎样说的？“密西西比将为你感到骄傲
How does Lester tell it? "Mississippi would be proud of you.

1264
01:49:15,590 --> 01:49:18,380
你为白人而奋斗”
"You've struck a blow for the white man."

1265
01:49:18,590 --> 01:49:21,220
是你说的吗？克林顿
Is that what you said, Clinton?

1266
01:49:22,050 --> 01:49:26,510
是你说的吗？一定是你
Is that what you said? It must have been you.

1267
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:31,980
因为克莱顿·汤利和雷·斯塔基不在场
Because Clayton Townley and Ray Stuckey, they were too smart to be there.

1268
01:49:32,190 --> 01:49:36,190
你太愚蠢了 没料到有人记得吧
You're too stupid to think anybody would remember what you had to say.

1269
01:49:36,980 --> 01:49:40,050
但老莱斯特记忆很好
But old Lester, he got a good memory.

1270
01:49:43,990 --> 01:49:48,160
我很抱歉 我很久没这样了
I'm sorry. I haven't done this for a long time.

1271
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:49,980
你有讲吗？
Did you make a speech

1272
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:53,600
在你打你妻子的那晚 克林顿 呵？
the night that you beat up your wife, Clinton? Huh?

1273
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:55,520
你说？
Did you?

1274
01:49:56,290 --> 01:49:59,110
你打白人的那晚呢？
Did you strike a blow for the white man that night?

1275
01:50:03,590 --> 01:50:06,390
你可知道你有一种傻笑？佩尔
You got a stupid smile. You know that, pal?

1276
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,700
你看到了吗？呵
Can you see it? Huh?

1277
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:15,520
推土机辗过黑人孩子时 傻笑了吗？
Did you smile when the bulldozer ran over the black kid's body? Did you?

1278
01:50:19,230 --> 01:50:22,860
掩盖那些尸体时 傻笑了吗？
Did you smile when the bodies were covered over?

1279
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:25,820
起来 快起来 起来
Get up here. Come on! Get up here.

1280
01:50:26,030 --> 01:50:30,530
你傻笑了吗？你说？
Did you smile that same stupid smile? Huh? Did you?

1281
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:39,340
傻笑了吗？佩尔 笑了吗？
Did you smile, Pell? Did you smile?

1282
01:50:47,890 --> 01:50:50,300
没有错吧 副警长
Make no mistake about it, Deputy.

1283
01:50:50,510 --> 01:50:52,620
我会切断你的狗头
I'll cut your fucking head clear off

1284
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:55,770
不会在乎那些胡说八道
and not give a shit how it reads in the report sheet.

1285
01:51:18,580 --> 01:51:21,750
再吃一口 再吃一口
One more bite. One more bite.

1286
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:24,710
再吃一口 亲爱的 再吃一口
One more bite, darling. One more bite.

1287
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:44,180
莱斯特 怎么了？
Shit, Lester! What the fuck is going on here?

1288
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:47,740
闭嘴 进卧室锁住门
Shut up! You get in the bedroom and lock the door!

1289
01:51:47,860 --> 01:51:50,030
别靠近窗子
And stay away from the windows!

1290
01:52:00,500 --> 01:53:02,000
该死
Shit!

1291
01:53:06,690 --> 01:53:10,000
拜托 拜托 我并没有说你们的事
Please! Please! I didn't say a thing!

1292
01:53:10,100 --> 01:53:13,110
我发誓 这是圈套 我并没有说什么
I swear it's a setup! I didn't say nothing!

1293
01:53:14,490 --> 01:53:17,620
我什么也没说
Nothing! I didn't say nothing!

1294
01:53:17,830 --> 01:53:19,370
我什么都没说
I didn't say nothing!

1295
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:28,630
我什么也没说
I didn't say nothing!

1296
01:53:49,070 --> 01:53:52,260
你很幸运 我们一直在关注你 莱斯特
You're lucky we've been watching your ass, Lester.

1297
01:53:55,110 --> 01:53:59,620
考恩斯先生 你如果自首 我们就会保护你
If you go on the record, Mr. Cowens, we'll give you protection.

1298
01:53:59,830 --> 01:54:00,830
否则…
If not...

1299
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:04,750
否则 他们会杀了你
If not, they're gonna kill you anyway.

1300
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:08,790
莱斯特 你需要洗洗
Oh! You need a toilet, Lester.

1301
01:54:33,030 --> 01:54:35,400
真的要他死？
Really had him going, huh?

1302
01:55:07,900 --> 01:55:11,530

1310
01:57:16,940 --> 01:57:18,610
他为什么这样做？
Why did he do it?

1311
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:22,030
他甚至没有涉及
He wasn't even in on it.

1312
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:23,950
他甚至不是三K党
He wasn't even Klan.

1313
01:57:24,490 --> 01:57:27,450
伯德先生 他有罪
Mr. Bird, he was guilty.

1314
01:57:27,790 --> 01:57:31,870
不能只看表面 要看实质
Anyone's guilty who watches this happen and pretends it isn't.

1315
01:57:32,870 --> 01:57:36,420
不 他有罪 对吧
No, he was guilty, all right.

1316
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:40,260
就象扣扳机的那些狂热者一样有罪
Just as guilty as the fanatics who pulled the trigger.

1317
01:57:42,550 --> 01:57:44,010
也许我们都有罪
Maybe we all are.

1318

Hello?

I just missed you at the hospital. They said you'd gone home.

1321
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,080
怎么能舍弃这里
What's left of it.

1322
01:58:58,540 --> 01:59:00,040
非常抱歉
I'm real sorry.

1323

So am I.

1324
01:59:03,170 --> 01:59:04,660
有什么打算？
What are you gonna do?

1325
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:06,420
我不知道
I don't know.

1326
01:59:08,890 --> 01:59:10,500
你要去哪里？
