00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,060
- 我抓住你了  - 不，不
- I got you.  - No, no, no, no.

5
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,290
我抓住你了，我抓住你了
I got you. I got you.

6
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,570
好了，没事了，别怕
Okay, it's okay. Okay.

7
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,590
上帝啊
Oh, god.

8
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,330
都…都过去了
It's... it's okay.

9
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,530
- 天哪  - 上来
- Oh, god.  - Come on.

10
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,070
噢，天
Oh, god.

11
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,580
披上这个
There you go.

12
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,890
他们都死了
They're all dead.

13
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,360
他把他们都杀死了
He killed them all.

14
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,130
我搞不懂你们这些人
I can't figure you people out.

15
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:12,970
蜜岛沼泽封了这么多年是有原因的
Honey Island Swamp has been closed for decades and for good reason.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,500
但总有些该死的笨蛋自作聪明
But every now and then, some stupid son-of-a-bitch thinks he knows better.

17
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,340
我懂你的意思
I knew.

18
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,140
我猜，你不相信世上有鬼
Let me guess, you don't believe in ghosts.

19
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,150
你认为维克托・柯劳利只是个传说
You think Victor Crowley is a legend.

20
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,810
我去那儿找我的家人…
I went in there to find my family, my...

21
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,250
我弟弟和我爸爸
My brother and my father.

22
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,050
他把他们全杀了
He killed them all.

23
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,860
他们去那儿干什么？
What the hell were they doing in there?

24
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,890
夜间捕猎
Night fishing.

25
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,390
我爸爸是捕鳄人
My daddy was a gator hunter.

26
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,530
他和我弟弟一旦远离所有人，开始捕猎
He and my brother started pulling in twice their load

27
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,440
就会加倍地超负荷工作
once they start to hunt away from everybody else.

28
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,070
自从我妈妈去世之后，我们需要钱
We needed the money after my momma passed away.

29
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,980
噢，天哪
Oh, god.

30
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,820
现在我孤身一人了
Now I'm all alone.

31
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,150
那你父亲应该更了解这里
Your daddy should have known better.

32
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,890
附近每个猎人都知道，不要走进那片该死的沼泽
Hell, every hunter from around here knows not to go in that damn swamp.

33
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,520
我总是告诫他们“离那鬼地方远点儿！”
I was telling 'em, I say, "Stay the hell out!"

34
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,460
结果他们把我当疯子
Well, they all call me crazy.

35
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,990
以为我脑子有病
They think I'm sick in the head.

36
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,330
来喝几口暖暖身子
Here, you drink this. It's nice and warm.

37
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,800
先做要紧的
First things first.

38
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,140
我们得弄清楚你住哪儿，然后把你送回去
We gotta find out wherever it is you're living and get you there.

39
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,300
再带你看医生
We're gonna get you a doctor.

40
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,280
我觉得我们应该报警
I think I should go to the police.

41
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,280
报警？
The police?

42
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,480
就是填一张失踪报告
What, and fill out one of the missing reports,

43
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,320
像这个地区填的其他几百个人一样？
like the hundreds of others filled out in this area?

44
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,910
你永远都不会从他们那儿听到回信的
You'll never hear back from them.

45
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,360
但我知道他们的尸体在哪儿
But I know where their bodies are.

46
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,450
哼，是啊
Yeah, right.

47
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,960
那些大城市的警察正在往这儿赶呢
Those big city cops are hightailing down here

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,620
而且还会在野生动物吃掉尸体之前找到证据
and-and-and they'll find all that evidence before the wildlife eats it.

49
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,960
那我该怎么做？
What am I supposed to do?

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,730
再也别回到这儿来
Never come back this way again.

51
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,740
你可真是够幸运的
Hell, you're a lucky girl.

52
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:00,230
活着从那儿出来了，一个零件也没少！
You got out of there alive and with all your pieces!

53
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,340
小姐，你…你叫什么名字？
Look, miss, what... what's your name?

54
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,780
玛丽贝思
Marybeth.

55
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,510
玛丽贝思・丹斯顿
Marybeth Dunston.

56
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,490
老天啊，你是萨姆森的孩子
Holy Christ, your Samson's kid.

57
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,010
是的
Yes.

58
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,890
出去！
Get out!

59
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,490
- 什么？ - 离开我的房子，快点！
- What?  - Get out of my house right now!

60
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,260
现在就出去！
Get out, now!

61
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,630
你认识我爸爸？
You knew my daddy?

62
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,930
不认识
No.

63
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,960
但是我知道你爸爸都干了什么
But I know what your daddy did

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,060
而且我不想和他有半点牵连
and I want nothing to do with it.

65
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,600
我自己好好呆着，鬼魂会离我远远的
I keep myself to myself, and that ghost leaves me be.

66
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,440
但我不能跟你有任何关系
But I can't have nothing to do with you.

67
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,140
出去！
Get out!

68
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,810
可我怎么回家呢？
But how am I supposed to get home?

69
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,820
那扇门外就是洛基路
Out that door is Lodge Road.

70
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,480
你沿着它走半英里
You take it a half a mile down,

71
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,250
到一个加油站，那里你可以搭车
you're gonna find a gas station, you get a ride from there,

72
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,720
但我不能跟你有半点关系，出去！
but I can't have nothing to do with you. Get out!

73
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,590
我…可我不明白这是为什么？
I... but I... I don't understand.

74
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,520
快从我这儿离开，玛丽贝思・丹斯顿
You get out of my house, Marybeth Dunston.

75
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,300
到底是怎么回事？
What's going on?

76
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,140
想知道的话就去找祖比牧师
You want answers, you go see Reverend Zombie.

77
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,530
现在，小姐，请你离开这儿，越远越好
Now, miss, you get far, far away from here

78
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,570
不然我发誓会把你的脑袋打开花
or I swear to God I will shoot you dead.

79
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,000
我没做错什么事
I didn't do nothing wrong.

80
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,310
之前我不知道她是谁
I didn't know who she was.

81
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,340
那不算数
It don't count.

82
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,710
好吧，我们来看看今晚有什么收获
All right, let's take a look at tonight's haul.

83
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,340
都弄到了什么？
What do we got here?

84
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,700
不错嘛
Oh, that's nice.

85
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,070
好
Yeah.

86
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,230
就是它了
That's it.

87
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,340
播放
Play.

88
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,280
我们来看点东西，表演时间到了，对吧？
Let's see something. It's show time, huh?

89
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,750
喔！
Whoo!

90
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,620
- 好了  - 等等，这会上河口海狸吗？
- There you go.  - Wait. Is this gonna be on Bayou Beavers?

91
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,880
没错
Score.

92
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,980
来看看你能干点什么
Let's see what you can do.

93
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,720
很好，因为我想让我爸爸看看
Good, 'cause I want my daddy to see this.

94
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,950
喔！
Whoo!

95
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,260
他妈的，老爸
Fuck you, Dad!

96
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,790
真希望你看到这个
I hope that you're watching this...

97
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,320
哦，好吧
Oh, yeah.

98
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,730
因为你爱丹尼尔多过我
... because you love Danielle more than me

99
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,630
我也希望比尔在办公室…
and I hope that Bill at the office...

100
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,070
转过来，放松点
Roll back, relax a little bit

101
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,370
给我们看看辛迪的另一面…就这样
maybe show us the other side of Cindy... there we go.

102
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,270
哦，你看上去棒极了
Oh, you look fantastic.

103
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,250
真不错，真不错
Really nice. Really nice.

104
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,840
我是不是在哪见过你？
Don't I know you from somewhere?

105
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,440
不，没见过
No, you don't know me.

106
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,110
- 把头发放到…  - 不对！我认识你
- Maybe put your hair up in a...  - No, no! I know you.

107
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,210
你是…你是我五年级的历史老师
You're-you're my History teacher from fifth grade.

108
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,480
- 哦，不是的  - 巴雷特先生
- Oh, no.  - Mr. Barrett.

109
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,250
- 我是夏皮罗  - 是吗…
- I'm Mr. Shapiro.  - Yeah...

110
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,420
嗨，你要去哪儿？
Hey, where are you going?

111
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,060
先生，别跟着我
Mister, leave me alone.

112
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,190
快点，干嘛不把衣服撩起来
Come on. Why don't you to lift up that shirt.

113
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,460
看看衣服下面有什么
Let's see what you got going on under there.

114
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,060
嘿，我才十四岁
Dude, I'm 14.

115
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,800
噢，这可不好
Oh, that ain't right.

116
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:18,740
好的，好的
Good, good.

117
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,940
我一说开拍，你们就脱下浴巾
Okay, when I say action, you girls drop the towels and, uh,

118
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,280
然后开始互相洗澡
start washing each other.

119
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,800
好的，不
Yeah, no.

120
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,940
好了，姑娘们，脱下浴巾
Okay, girls. Drop the towels.

121
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,040
脱下浴巾
Drop the towels.

122
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,280
让我碰得肝炎的人？
Touch Walking Hepatitis over here?

123
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:31,910
我不干
I'll pass.

124
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,420
至少我不是个两性人
Well, at least I'm not a hermaphrodite.

125
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,360
两性人，就是今天送你的生僻词
Hermaphrodite, big word of the day for you.

126
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,760
什么是两性人，亲爱的？
What is a hermaphrodite, darling?

127
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,030
我凭什么要说第二遍呢？
Why would I tell you if I just said it?

128
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,360
我当然知道那是什么
Of course, I knew what it is.

129
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,300
- 你大概不知道  - 那你干嘛不继续解释一下？
- You probably don't know what it is.  - Well, why don't you go ahead and explain it?

130
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,030
我为什么要解释？
Why would I need to explain it?

131
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,590
也许你甚至不知道它的意思
You probably don't even know what it is.

132
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,500
那我们就数到“三”一起说？
Why don't we do it on the count of three together?

133
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,100
- 好吧  - 好了吗？
- Fine.  - Okay?

134
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,370
一，二，三
One, two, three.

135
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,310
就是既有阴茎又有子宫的人
Aperson who has a penis and a vagina.

136
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,440
嗯
Ew.

137
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,670
我什么都没做！
I didn't do nothin'!

138
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,660
我甚至都不知道那姑娘是谁！
I didn't even know who that girl was!

139
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:09,800
短柄斧 II

140
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,640
你想干什么？
What do you want?

141
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,200
嗨
Hi.

142
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,270
嗯，有些事我得跟你谈谈
Um, I need to talk to you about something?

143
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,080
改天再来吧
Come back some other time.

144
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,980
我很忙
I'm busy

145
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,850
什么时候？
When?

146
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,010
下个月
Next month.

147
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,110
不行
No.

148
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,390
我要跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

149
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,050
现在就谈
Now.

150
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,560
好吧，好吧，进来吧，进来吧
All right, all right. Come in. Come in.

151
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,260
最好是重要的事
This better be important.

152
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,470
我是个大忙人
I'm a busy guy.

153
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,840
杰克・克拉克让我来的
Jack Cracker sent me.

154
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,210
什么？
What?

155
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,640
我们吓坏了，太可怕了
(TV) We're so scared, it was terrifying.

156
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,580
我再也不去滑雪了
I'm never going skiing again.

157
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,850
那个疯老头子？
That old whackjob?

158
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,720
那你需要我做什么？
So what do you need from me?

159
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,880
所有人都死了
Everybody's dead.

160
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,150
昨晚在蜜岛沼泽…
Last night in Honey Island Swamp...

161
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,060
蜜岛沼泽
Honey Island Swamp.

162
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,730
你参加了吗？
Were you on that tour?

163
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,030
是的
Yeah.

164
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,040
你怎么知道的？
And how did you know?

165
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,100
发生了什么？
What happened?

166
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,770
那个开船是个蠢货
The boat driver was an idiot.

167
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:33,080
船抛锚了，柯劳利杀掉了所有的人
He got us stuck, and Crowley massacred everybody.

168
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,240
但我逃走了
But I got away.

169
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,180
肖恩，那个开船的呢，他死了吗？
Shaun, the boat driver, is he dead?

170
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,050
你认识他？
You knew him?

171
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,650
嘘！
Shoo!

172
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,120
是我雇的他
He worked for me.

173
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,460
那是我的船
That was one of my boats.

174
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,830
我不明白
I don't understand.

175
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,370
闭嘴
Shut up.

176
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,300
自从我开店以来这么多年
No one's been able to run tours out of this swamp for years,

177
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,010
没有人能跑下来这个沼泽的旅游业务
not since I've had this shop.

178
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:04,910
从来没有
Ever.

179
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,540
我不能，谁都不能
Not me, not anybody.

180
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:13,350
所以我被迫在我另一个店的后门搞旅游
So I was forced to run tours at the back door of one of my other shops.

181
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,520
世道艰难，挣一点是一点
Times are tough and money is money.

182
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,260
你跟我爸爸做的差不多
You sound just like my daddy.

183
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,730
你爸爸是谁？
Who's yourfather?

184
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,030
萨姆森・丹斯顿
Samson Dunston.

185
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,060
萨姆森・丹斯顿
Samson Dunston.

186
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,760
你是萨姆森・丹斯顿的孩子？
Samson Dunston's kid?

187
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,460
是的
Yes.

188
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,970
你爸爸还好吗？
Well, how is old Samson doing?

189
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,980
他死了
He's dead.

190
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,380
主啊
Grace.

191
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,000
柯劳利杀了他
Crowley got him

192
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,240
还有我哥哥
and my brothertoo,

193
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,440
后来杰克・克拉克被我吓着了
and then Jack Cracker freaked out on me.

194
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,780
知道我是谁之后差点冲我开枪
Practically shot me when he found out who I was.

195
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,850
他说你会告诉我我爸爸做的事
He said that you would be able to tell me what my daddy did.

196
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,250
萨姆森・丹斯顿
Samson Dunston.

197
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,320
- 萨姆森・丹斯顿已经不在了  - 求你了
- Samson Dunston's gone.  - Please.

198
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,830
你都知道些什么？
What do you know?

199
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,160
一些小道消息
Same thing that everybody else whispers

200
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,630
我猜是关于林区的
about these backwoods, I suppose.

201
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,360
那事发生的时候我只是在附近
Only I was around when it actually happened.

202
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,740
什么事发生的时候？
When what happened?

203
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,930
很久以前
A long time ago

204
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:09,570
在你出生之前，那时候我还是个小男孩
before you were born when I wasjust a boy.

205
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,950
有一个叫做托马斯・柯劳利的人
There was a man named Thomas Crowley.

206
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,880
他就住在蜜岛沼泽
He lived out there in Honey Island Swamp

207
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,890
还有他的妻子夏恩
with his wife Shyann.

208
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,620
他们与世隔绝
They lived alone.

209
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,890
没有孩子，就他们两个人
No kids, just the two of them.

210
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,990
夏恩病了，大概是胃癌之类的
Shyann was sick,

211
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:29,760
病魔让她日益消瘦
some sort of stomach cancer eating her up slowly

212
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,100
慢慢夺走了她的生命
and gradually taking its time.

213
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,500
我听到的是
Now the way I always heard it

214
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,440
夏恩有个护士叫丽娜
Shyann had a nurse named Lena

215
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,570
是个漂亮的法裔女人，会过来照顾她
a beautiful Cajun woman who would come by to tend to her.

216
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,280
在夏恩病逝前的那段时间里
And over the long months of Shyann's passing,

217
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,080
托马斯和丽娜越来越亲近
Thomas and Lena got closer.

218
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,280
过分亲近了
Too close.

219
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,570
你可以说托马斯是个骗子或异教徒
Call Thomas Crowley a cheat, call him an infidel,

220
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,550
但在那种情况下
but given the circumstances,

221
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:23,350
生活里只有悲伤和不幸
the entire situation was nothing but sad and tragic.

222
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,290
妻子如死人般过了那么多年
With his wife as good as dead for so many years,

223
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,390
痛苦的情感需要释放
it was only a matter of time until the pain and suffering of his own emotions

224
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:34,760
这是迟早的事
needed to be addressed.

225
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,100
起初的一年托马斯和丽娜一直偷偷摸摸的
It took almost a year of Thomas and Lena carrying on in secret

226
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:45,200
他们希望夏恩平静的死去
before the day came when Shyann finally found peace from her suffering.

227
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,050
而她得死并不安详
But the moment was not so much a release

228
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,020
简直就是噩梦
as it was a nightmare.

229
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,070
不
No!

230
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,170
她对托马斯・柯劳利和她的情妇丽娜下了诅咒
She put a curse on Thomas Crowley and his mistress, Lena,

231
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,900
诅咒他们
a curse that would not only damn them

232
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,570
甚至诅咒丽娜肚子里的私生子
but the bastard child that was already growing in Lena's belly.

233
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,890
不
No.

234
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,920
据说维克托・柯劳利出生的那一天
They say that on the day Victor Crowley was born,

235
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,230
沼泽里将悲鸣不断
the swamp mourned.

236
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,860
树木哭泣
The trees wept.

237
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,930
生命染病而死
The wildlife became sickly and died.

238
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,740
他的降生好像瘟疫的到来
His presence was like a pestilence

239
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,640
周围到处是死亡
that turned the area into death.

240
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,350
用力，就出来了
Come on. There it is.

241
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,650
用力，用力
Push, push.

242
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,550
快了
Push. There it is. Come on.

243
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,150
用力点，再用力点
Come on. One more.

244
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,930
就好了
Here it comes.

245
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,490
加油，加油
One more, one more.

246
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:21,700
维克多・柯劳利带着可笑的肿瘤和疾病出生
Victor Crowley was born ridden with grotesque tumors, disease

247
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,290
还有痛苦
and pain.

248
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,210
让我看看，让我看看他！
Let me see. Let me see it!

249
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,870
一个活生生的怪物
A living monster.

250
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,940
而丽娜…
And Lena...

251
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:39,040
有人说她看到孩子的第一眼就死了
Some say she died the moment she laid eyes on her child.

252
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,090
传说会让你相信
Now the legend would have you believe that Mr. Crowley

253
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:52,730
克劳利先生是为了保护孩子才把他藏起来的
kept his son hidden away to protect him,

254
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,760
事实上他是为了掩盖他的错误
but what he was really hiding

255
00:18:55,810 --> 00:19:00,440
他的背叛
was his mistake, his infidelity

256
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,600
和他受到的诅咒
and his curse.

257
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,990
很多年来托马斯一直尝试去爱他的怪物儿子
Over the years, Thomas Crowley learned to love his monster of a son.

258
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,620
两个人与世隔绝
With just the two of them being hidden away,

259
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,460
上帝给了他们片刻宁静
he made his peace with God.

260
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,830
在万圣节的那天晚上…
And on that fateful Halloween night...

261
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,670
托马斯为了救出自己的儿子
Thomas tried to save his son

262
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,140
他用短斧想要劈开门
by chopping through the door with a hatchet

263
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,770
而意外发生了
And by accident,

264
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,810
他不小心砍死了自己的孩子
killed his only son.

265
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,520
滚出来！
Get out here!

266
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,020
滚出来接受惩罚！
Get out here and get what's coming to you!

267
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,430
你们躲不了一辈子！
You can't hide forever!

268
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,120
你们杀了我的儿子
You killed my son.

269
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,160
你们杀了我的儿子
You killed my son.

270
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,000
你们杀了我的儿子
You killed my son.

271
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,600
犯了错的孩子一直躲在父母的身后
The children responsible hid behind their parents,

272
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,240
什么也不承认
denied everything

273
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,980
托马斯・克劳利在痛苦中度过了余生
and left Thomas Crowley to live out the rest of his days in anguish.

274
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,520
你们杀死了我的儿子
You killed my son.

275
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,150
一些年后，他也死了
Years later, he finally passed

276
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,590
备受折磨的一生终于结束
and the torture of this life was over.

277
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:29,090
而维克多・柯劳利却成了悲剧人物
But Victor Crowley would become one of the most tragic

278
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:35,630
以及路易斯安那州的一个令人心碎的传说
and heartbreaking tales of Louisiana.

279
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:39,110
一个困在沼泽里的被杀死了的人
A man trapped in the night he was killed,

280
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,940
却还每晚出来游荡
still out there, wandering the swamp

281
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:48,420
找他的爸爸
each night trying to find his daddy.

282
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,680
没人知道死了多少人
No one knows the body count,

283
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,590
但自从维克多死后
but for years after he died, fishermen,

284
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,430
渔民，捕鳄人
Gator hunters,

285
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,000
还有那些来打探传说的人
And those who were just too foolish to heed the tales,

286
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,340
都在沼泽里消失了
all disappeared in that swamp

287
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,970
被肢解，谋杀，屠戮
mutilated, murdered, massacred

288
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,450
被这个鬼魂魄撕成碎片
and torn to pieces by the ghost

289
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,080
成为维克多的刀下魂
of Victor Crowley.

290
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,490
这和我有什么关系？
What does that have to do with me?

291
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,190
你的父亲萨姆森
Your father, Samson,

292
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,600
是那三个谋杀了维克多的孩子中的一个
was one of the three kids who murdered Victor Crowley.

293
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,470
尽管是意外
An accident, yes,

294
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,980
但这个悲剧使得蜜岛沼泽
but a tragedy that has left Honey Island Swamp

295
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,880
永远的被维克多的鬼魂缠绕
cursed with the ghost of Victor Crowley forever.

296
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,640
啊
Uh.

297
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,620
我从没有…
I... I never...

298
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,210
当然了
Of course.

299
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,690
你怎么可能知道？
How could you know?

300
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,950
你怎么知道我父亲参与其中的？
How do you know that my dad was involved?

301
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:07,730
因为如果当时我胆子够大，就和他们一起去了
Because if I had been brave enough, I would have been out there too.

302
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,890
我是你父亲的老熟人
I'm an old acquaintance of Samson.

303
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,770
- 柯劳利跟着我们的那天晚上…  - 你看见他了？
- When Crowley came after us last night...  - You saw him?

304
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,170
是的
Yes.

305
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,270
他看着我
He looked at me

306
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,680
就好像认识我一样
like he knew me.

307
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,910
或许他能感觉出你是谁
Perhaps he could sense who you really were.

308
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,180
或许那只是我的感觉罢了
Perhaps it was all on your mind.

309
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:35,420
维克多的复活只能用超自然来解释
Victor Crowley is what's known in the paranormal world as a repeater.

310
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,120
他的悲剧和过早死亡，逼迫他重新体验那个时刻
His tragic and untimely death has left him forced to relive

311
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:45,030
一晚又一晚，一次又一次
that moment night after night, over and over.

312
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:51,600
他所知道的只有恐惧，和向踏进沼泽的人复仇
All he knows is the fear and revenge towards anybody who steps foot in that swamp.

313
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,370
你知道这一切都是真的
You knew all this was real

314
00:22:54,410 --> 00:23:01,750
却仍然送无辜的人去那里旅游？
yet you still sent a tour boat full of innocent people in there?

315
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,270
为了什么？
For what?

316
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,610
为了什么？为了钱吗？
For what? For money?

317
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,850
肖恩
Shaun.

318
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,550
他不该那么靠近的
He wasn't supposed to get that close.

319
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,590
他不该无缘无故停在那里
He wasn't supposed to stop for nothing.

320
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,660
现在我的船走进沼泽几个月了
Now I've had boats go into that swamp for months now,

321
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,400
两个月了，没令人担心过
two months now, with no worries.

322
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,770
你去那儿，除了知道这个传说之外
Besides you knew the legend.

323
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,300
也知道你父亲做的事
You went in there knowing the story as did your father,

324
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:25,900
我去是为了…
I went in...

325
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,240
任何人都没你们清楚
who more than anybody should have known better.

326
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,080
我是去找他们
I went in there to find them

327
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,840
而且我找到了
and I did!

328
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,480
没几个人见过维克多的真面目
Not many people have seen the face of Victor Crowley

329
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,390
还能活着回来说
and lived to tell about it.

330
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,720
你可真够幸运的
Consider yourself lucky.

331
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,490
幸运？
Lucky?

332
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:49,330
我的家人都死光了！
My family is gone!

333
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,770
对你的不幸我感到遗憾
I'm sorry for your loss.

334
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,230
- 带我回去  - 什么？
- Take me back there.  - What?

335
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:02,270
我不能把他们留在那儿
I can't leave them there. Please.

336
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:08,880
求你了，我就是想把他们带回来
Please. I just wanna take them home.

337
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,550
你想要的是复仇才对
What you want is revenge.

338
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:15,390
这可不是个好主意，玛丽贝思・丹斯顿
It's a bad idea, Marybeth Dunston.

339
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,090
不是个好主意
Bad idea.

340
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,620
求你了
Please.

341
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,730
求你，我只是想埋葬家人
Please. I just wanna bury my family.

342
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,800
如果能顺便解决了那个怪物
And if I can take that monster out with me,

343
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,670
那就更好不过了
then all the better.

344
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:39,270
你杀不了他的
You can't kill him.

345
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,370
他会一次次复活
He'll just be reborn.

346
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:45,980
他会恢复到死前的状态
He's supposed to return to the state he was when he was killed.

347
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:50,290
鬼魂是无法被杀死的
You can't kill a ghost.

348
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:53,890
或许我杀不了他
Or maybe I can't.

349
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,920
或许我可以
Or maybe I can.

350
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:04,330
我可以用斧子劈烂他的脸！
But I am gonna bury that hatchet deep into his fucking face!

351
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:17,310
你还是要我到警察局告发你？
Or would you rather I go to the police and tell them about your swamp tour business?

352
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:26,620
告诉警察他们可以在哪里找到游客的尸首
Maybe tell them where to find the bodies of a boat full of tourists

353
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,000
那些非法运送的游客？
that you sent in there illegally, huh?

354
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,590
行，行，行
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

355
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,070
好吧
All right.

356
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,570
什么？
Yes?

357
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:43,980
你想要复仇？
You want revenge on Victor Crowley?

358
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,280
我会帮你找到它
I want you to find it.

359
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,650
你会带我回去？
So you'll take me back in there?

360
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,310
但是我有条件
But I have some conditions.

361
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,690
我们不能独自去那里，我们需要帮助
We're not going in there alone. We need help.

362
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,210
我们需要枪
We need guns.

363
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,890
有几个人跟着去会更安全
And there's a few specific people that I feel safer having along.

364
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:03,090
你要你今晚带我去就行
Fine, if you take me back in there tonight.

365
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,970
今晚两点我们在这会面
Now, you meet me here at 2 o'clock.

366
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,370
我要打几个电话
I have some phone calls to make.

367
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,070
我得组织个狩猎队之类的
I'm gonna gathertogether a little hunting expedition of sorts.

368
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:17,740
那个怪物一挂，我就能安心做生意了
With that ghost gone, I can clear that swamp.

369
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,840
你知道我不关心你的沼泽旅游生意
You know, I don't care about your swamp tour business.

370
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,080
我不关心你的钱
I don't care about your money.

371
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,740
我只想带家人回家
I just want to bring my family home.

372
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:28,450
- 你要带回我的家人…  - 我说过了…可以
- If you think that bring...  - I said... yes.

373
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:34,730
但是我建议你不要单独跟我去
But you know, I think it would be better if you didn't go in there alone.

374
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,660
有没有人可以跟你一同去
Do you have somebody you can bring,

375
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,660
男朋友或者叔叔之类的？
boyfriend or an uncle perhaps?

376
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,170
我不想把任何我认识的人牵扯进来
I'm not bringing anybody else I know into this.

377
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,540
嗯哼
Uh-uh.

378
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,340
你能带个人来的话我会更放心
I'd feel better if you brought somebody,

379
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,140
带个亲人过来
if you brought another family member with you.

380
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,200
不
No.

381
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,410
那没的谈了
Then no deal.

382
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:58,010
如果我带叔叔过来你就让我们去是吗？
So if I bring my uncle back, then you will take us?

383
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,610
我就是这个意思
That's what I said.

384
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,330
我两点回来
I'll be back at 2:00.

385
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,120
我等你
I'll be here.

386
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,170
贾斯丁！
Justin!

387
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,210
贾斯丁！
Justin!

388
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,800
滚过来！
Get your butt down here!

389
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,250
老板？
Yeah, boss?

390
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,300
你打算什么时候告诉我
When were you gonna tell me

391
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,370
你哥哥没开船回来？
that your brother didn't bring the boat back?

392
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,880
他还没回来？
Oh, he didn't?

393
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,250
肖恩昨晚没开船回来？
So Shaun didn't bring the boat back last night?

394
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:37,990
嗯哼
Uh-uh.

395
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,550
他是个新手
Look, he'sjust new at this.

396
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,790
我保证没问题的，或许他现在已经开回来了
I'm sure things are fine... he's probably got the boat back by now.

397
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:44,300
那本该是你的活，他替你的班儿了
That was your shift. He was covering for you, okay?

398
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,860
他没回来，所有事都不对
He didn't bring the boat back and everything's not all right.

399
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,100
为什么？发生什么事了？
Why? What... what's wrong?

400
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,130
我们得去一趟，把船弄回来
We gotta go out there and recover my boat.

401
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,610
肖恩还在沼泽里？
Shaun's still in the swamp?

402
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,540
显然是
Apparently.

403
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,170
他还好吗？
Is he all right?

404
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:57,510
我保证他会没事的
I'm sure he will be all right.

405
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:02,040
我要你出去召集一批猎手和渔民
I need you to go out and organize a group of hunters and fishermen,

406
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,810
熟悉沼泽环境的人
people that know the way around the swamp.

407
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,120
我有一个计划
I got a proposition to make them

408
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:11,250
而且你要确保这个人一定要来
and you make sure that this name is on the list.

409
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:16,360
我们要进行小探险了
We're going on a little expedition.

410
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,560
这算一种商业宣传吗？
Is this like a publicitything forthe shop?

411
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,400
差不多吧
Something like that.

412
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,460
你好？
Hello?

413
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,030
谁在哪？
Who's there?

414
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,240
你好？
Hello?

415
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,970
玛丽贝斯？萨姆森？
Marybeth? Samson?

416
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,410
鲍勃叔叔？
Uncle Bob?

417
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,040
我就过去
I'll be right down.

418
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:13,580
你父亲是个好人，你知道的
Your father was a good man, you know that.

419
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,680
他一直是我最好的朋友
He's always been my best friend.

420
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,390
尽管这些年我住在北边，但我们一直保持联络
Even all those years I lived up north, we'd talk all the time.

421
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,400
祖比牧师说
Reverend Zombie said dad was

422
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:24,090
爸爸对维克多・柯劳利的死负有责任
one of the people responsible for Victor Crowley's death.

423
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,190
真的吗？
Is that true?

424
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,720
祖比牧师？
Reverend Zombie?

425
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,760
你怎么会跟那个恶棍有接触？
Why are you talking to that low-life?

426
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,430
他是个小偷和骗子
He's a thief and crook

427
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:33,530
开假的巫毒商店，卖假纪念品
with his bogus voodoo shops and his fake souvenirs.

428
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,640
他说他认识与此事有关的人
Well, he said that he knew the people that were involved.

429
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,700
纯属胡说八道
He's full of horse-shit.

430
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,310
- 祖比牧师说…  - 祖比牧师说！
- Reverend Zombie said...  - Reverend Zombie said!

431
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:43,380
你居然这么称呼他？
Why do you call him that?

432
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:46,620
看在上帝的份上，他的真名是克利夫・华盛顿
His name is Clive Washington for Christ's sake.

433
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,990
他唯一擅长的就是当一个混蛋
The only thing he's reverend of is being an asshole.

434
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,360
你以前知道克劳利真的存在吗？
Did you know that Victor Crowley was real?

435
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,220
- 他不存在  - 我看见他了
- He's not real.  - I saw him.

436
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,360
他在我面前杀了所有的人
He murdered everyone in front of me.

437
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,800
让警察处理这件事
Let the police handle this.

438
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,860
- 首先…  - 不！
- First things...  - No!

439
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,930
你以为我在说谎？
So you think that I'm lying?

440
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,830
让我们出去透透气
Let's take a ride.

441
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,930
我们去趟医院，顺便告诉警察你经历的事情
We can go to the hospital and you can tell the cops all about it.

442
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,140
我要和祖比牧师回沼泽
I'm going back to the swamp with Reverend Zombie.

443
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,510
我死也不会同意的
Over my dead body are you going to that god damn swamp.

444
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,410
听我说，小姑娘
Now you listen to me, young lady.

445
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,820
你父亲死了之后
With yourfather gone,

446
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:23,260
现在我要对你负责，绝对禁止你做危险的事情
I'm responsible for you now and I absolutely forbid you

447
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,280
要让你远离他或者这片沼泽
to have anything to do with him or that swamp!

448
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,630
他建议你跟我一块去
He suggested that I bring you along.

449
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,400
- 他真这么说了？ - 嗯
- He did, didn't he?  - Mm-hmm.

450
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:36,170
跟我来吧，你会看到这一切都是真的
Come with me. You'll see Victor Crowley is real.

451
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,600
我们出去走走
Let's take a ride.

452
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,200
我们可不可以先等等？
Can we wait?

453
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,340
求你了，我会去报警的
Please. I will go to the police.

454
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,850
我什么都听你的
I will do whatever it is that you think that we need to do.

455
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,820
我只是想单独呆一会
I just... I just really need to be alone for a bit.

456
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:53,750
快点儿
Come on.

457
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:56,280
求你了
Please.

458
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,380
求你了，鲍勃叔叔，我就待一会儿
Please, Uncle Bob, just a few hours.

459
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,500
好吧，我一小时后回来
All right, I'll be back in an hour.

460
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,400
我自己会报警的
I'll call the police myself.

461
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,670
- 统统告诉警察  - 好的
- Get to the bottom of this.  - Okay.

462
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,750
玛丽贝斯
Marybeth,

463
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,910
向我保证你会远离那个骗子牧师
please promise me you'll stay away from Reverend Zombie.

464
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,710
我保证
I promise.

465
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:38,560
进来吧，我看见你了
Ah-ha, come on in. I see you!

466
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,800
欢迎来到祖比牧师的巫毒之屋
Welcome to Reverend Zombie's House of Voodoo.

467
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,400
拿一块免费的土豆片，然后找个座位坐下
Grab a complimentary Chips Ahoy and take a seat.

468
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,410
快点儿，请坐
Hurry. S'il vous plait.

469
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,340
会议马上就开始了
The meeting is about to start.

470
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,000
是的，哈哈
Yes. Ha-ha.

471
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:55,070
早上好，先生们，欢迎来巫毒之屋
Bonjour, monsieur. Welcome to the House of Voodoo.

472
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,520
请坐，别忘了我们今天护身符和药水特价
Take a seat and don't forget we have a sale on charms and potions today only.

473
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,680
别装腔作势了，混蛋
Drop the phony accent, asshole.

474
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,250
我不是为了该死的观光来的
I ain't no god damn tourist.

475
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,090
来点土豆片？
Chips Ahoy?

476
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,120
滚蛋
Fuck off.

477
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,740
嘿
Hey.

478
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:29,720
嘿，你想不想得到邮寄目录？
Ah, he-hey, uh, did you wanna get on the mailing list?

479
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,650
我的意思是，你可以只给我你的电话
Um, you can just gimme your number, I mean.

480
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:35,550
我是说，你不用给我，但是…
I mean you don't have to gimme but you...

481
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,060
婊子
Slut.

482
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,460
雷登？
Layton?

483
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,490
天啊，没想到在这儿见到你
Oh, my god, I didn't expect to see you here.

484
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,800
别这样，艾弗里
Come on, Avery.

485
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,030
什么？
What?

486
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:50,970
你这来干什么？
What are you doing here?

487
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,440
给五百块呢，为什么不来？
They said 500 bucks. Why not?

488
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,880
我们就这么打招呼？
Okay, so this is how we say hello now?

489
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,310
别这样
Please.

490
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:04,650
你电话收不到信息了？
Your phone don't get messages anymore either?

491
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,310
你知道我为什么来这儿？
You know why I'm here?

492
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:09,550
我需要者五百块来准备婚礼
I need the $500 to help pay for my wedding.

493
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:12,820
我的婚礼，艾弗里
My wedding, Avery.

494
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,350
我没法跟你在一起了
I am not getting into this with you.

495
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:19,560
我还单身哦
I'm single.

496
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,500
很好，很好
Ho, ho, ho. Tres bein, tres bein!

497
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,340
欢迎各位的到来
Welcome. All right, everyone.

498
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,070
十分感谢，或者就像法国人说的
Thanks or as the French say,

499
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:30,040
感谢大家能在这么短时间内过来
merci for coming down here on such short notice.

500
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,410
我知道你们都很忙
I know you are all busy people.

501
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,010
什么事？
Yes?

502
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,350
这些饼干是这么回事？
Hey, man, what's the deal with cookies?

503
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,750
每人一块还是可以多拿点？
Is it just like one each or could we get some more or what's up?

504
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,910
我们会提供更多饼干，但首先我们能否…
I have more cookies but first, can we, uh...

505
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,450
那我们现在可以要吗，还是会后？
Okay, so do we get them now or like after the meeting?

506
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,550
什么时间可以吃？
Or... what's the time stamp on them cookies there?

507
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,490
算了
Fine.

508
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,660
给你
There it is.

509
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,310
祝你好胃口
Bon appétit.

510
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,570
下午好各位
Good afternoon, everybody.

511
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:38,570
很高兴能看到很多熟悉的面孔
Good to see so many friends with familiar faces here today.

512
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,080
约翰
John.

513
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:42,850
克里特斯
Cleatus.

514
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:46,450
特伦特
Trent.

515
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:51,050
叫大家来是给大家找了个活儿
I brought y'all here today to make you an offer, to offer you ajob.

516
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,360
有一笔快钱，就在今晚
It's a quick gig. We do it tonight.

517
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:59,060
只要入伙，就有五百块
And for those of you thatjoin me, there's $500 in it for you.

518
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,660
是现金支付对吧？
And I assume the money will be in cash?

519
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,040
我们这儿可没人信得过你的支票
Not that any of us here don't trust a check from you,

520
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:08,240
我们要钱，不要白条
it's that we really want to get the money.

521
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:15,880
现金支付，工作完成之后
In cash, when thejob is done.

522
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,320
昨晚我有一艘船在沼泽失踪了
Last night, I lost one of my tour boats out there in that swamp,

523
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,550
所以我准备带一队人帮我找回来
so I'm putting together a group of sorts to go in there,

524
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:26,030
当然也打点儿猎
retrieve my boat, and in addition, go on a little night hunt.

525
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,330
找船要用这么多人？
Why do you need this many people to find a boat?

526
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,590
如果你不再打断我，我会告诉你的
If you stop interrupting me, I'll tell you.

527
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:35,800
五百块当然不会是仅仅找船那么简单
Now, of course, I'm not offering you y'all $500 just to retrieve a boat.

528
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,430
跟你们说实话吧
I'm gonna be honest with you.

529
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:40,130
还有更危险的事情要你们做
There's more to it and it could be dangerous.

530
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,440
伙计，有牛奶吗？
Hey man, do y'all got any milk?

531
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,840
- 什么？ - 牛奶啊
- What?  - Milk, man.

532
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,110
配饼干的牛奶
Milk forthe cookies, man.

533
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,640
牛奶，牛奶？
Milk. Milk?

534
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,170
没牛奶
No milk.

535
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,850
我们要去蜜岛沼泽
We're going to Honey Island swamp.

536
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,350
蜜岛沼泽关闭了，我们去不了
Honey Island's closed. We can't even go in there.

537
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:57,260
我知道，所以才给你们开价这么高
I know that. That's why I'm offering y'all $500,

538
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:01,190
除此之外，我愿意负所有的法律责任
and in addition, I'm willing to take on full legal responsibility

539
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,930
以防你们担心惹上政府的麻烦
in case there'll be any trouble with the authorities.

540
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,800
因此你们没有任何麻烦
So it won't be any risk to any of y'all.

541
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,390
我们到底在哪里打猎？
What exactly are we gonna be hunting?

542
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,660
就要提到地点了
I'm getting to that.

543
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:14,400
你们也知道，那里已经被关闭了很多年
As you know that swamp has been closed and condemned for too many years,

544
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,810
严重损害了我的旅游生意
and it's been crippling my tourism business

545
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:19,810
你们的打猎也大受影响
and it's been stopping those of you who make your living hunting

546
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:23,280
那里野生动物很多
an entire area rich with wildlife.

547
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,340
因此我建议我们一起打猎
So I'm proposing we put a little hunt,

548
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:28,550
证明给别人那里是安全的，没什么可怕的
go in there and prove once and for all that there's nothing to fear.

549
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,350
我们到底去猎什么？
What are we hunting?

550
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,530
维克多・克劳利
Victor Crowley.

551
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,390
等等，等等，等等，等等
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

552
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,700
等一下
Now hold on, now.

553
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,030
请等一下！
Hold on!

554
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,040
听我说，听我说
Now, listen to me. Listen to me.

555
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,630
如果那里真的有疯子
Now if there really is some maniac living up there,

556
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,840
我们把他们灭了，让这个地区再次安全起来
we just go in there, take them down and make the area safe again.

557
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,740
你们知道那只是个传说
All right, now, y'all know that's just a story

558
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:56,050
我们只需要去把这个骗人的传说揭穿罢了
so we go in there and put an end to all this swamp water stupidity.

559
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,280
我不去
Not I.

560
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,510
回来，回来，大家别走…
Now, now, now, now. Come on. Come on, everyone...

561
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,680
嘿，回来，大个子
Hey, come on now, big guy.

562
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,160
特伦特，你去哪儿？
Trent, where you going?

563
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,450
你怕什么？
You scared of something?

564
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,480
你知道我什么都不怕的
You know I ain't scared of nothing,

565
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:10,000
但是我不想和一群上蹿下跳叽叽喳喳的家伙
but I ain't about to go messing around in that swamp

566
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,800
一起为了五百块在沼泽里浪费时间
with a crew of stomp-jumping pecker woods for no 500 bucks.

567
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,100
嘿，我需要你，好吗？
Hey, I need you, all right?

568
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,660
你是这里枪法最准的
Now you're the best shot around here.

569
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,800
所以我才叫你
You know that. That's why I called for you.

570
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,400
我不想为了五百臭钱去冒险
I ain't riskin' my hide for 500 stinking dollars.

571
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,740
预付五百
Five hundred dollars up front just for you.

572
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,980
你知道我的经历
Clive, you know my history.

573
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,040
我不想有麻烦
I don't want no more trouble.

574
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:43,250
我知道上次你醉酒驾车之后琼就离开了你
I also know that after your last DUI, Joan left you, took the house,

575
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,290
拿走了你一半的财产，还搭上了别人
half of everything you have, hanging on a hook.

576
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,170
我说的不是这个经历
That ain't the history I'm talking about.

577
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,870
一千块现金，预付五百
One thousand dollars cash, $500 right now up front,

578
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,930
另五百早上给你
$500 in the morning.

579
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,540
就一晚上，我们都去，怎么样？
One night and we'll all be together, huh?

580
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,280
解决一切问题，我们…
Anything bad goes down, we...

581
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,250
就离开
leave.

582
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,620
嗯？
Hmm?

583
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,490
好吧
Yeah.

584
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,760
有什么事？
May I help you?

585
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,570
你一定是玛丽贝斯的叔叔吧
Oh, you must be Marybeth's uncle.

586
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,900
我是祖比牧师
I'm Reverend Zombie.

587
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,910
我是萨姆森的朋友，只是咱们没正式见过面
I was a friend of Samson, but you and I never officially met.

588
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,880
我对你不感兴趣
I don't care to know you.

589
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,310
我是来照顾她的
I'm here to look after the young lady.

590
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,590
对不起
I'm sorry.

591
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,220
我只是想…
I... I just need...

592
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:52,790
如果你非要去，我就和你一起
I'll do this with you if... if it's what you need to do right now,

593
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,670
我会在你身边
I'll do it with you.

594
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,190
但是必须要收集了你家人的遗骸就走
But then we gather up your father and your brother and we come back here.

595
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,770
别去管那个维克多・克劳利
No more of this Victor Crowley shit.

596
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,830
你要听我的话
You gotta listen to me.

597
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,180
一直在我身边，不能离开我的视线
You can't leave my side, you can't leave my sight,

598
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,840
我说离开就得离开
and when I say it's time to go, we leave.

599
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,320
谢谢你
Thank you.

600
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,890
老兄，谁是维克多・克劳利？
Hey, man. Who's Victor Crowley?

601
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:18,190
他什么都不是
Well, he's nothing,

602
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,990
本地的恶魔故事，说一个疯子在蜜岛沼泽出没
a local boogeyman story about a retarded maniac who haunts Honey Island.

603
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,930
为了吓唬小孩子别去沼泽
Peoplejust use it to keep kids away from the swamp.

604
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:28,270
类似于杰森・福尔西斯？
You mean like a Jason Voorhees or something?

605
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,530
就那意思
Something like that.

606
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:33,740
我八岁的时候住在回声幽谷
When I was eight, I lived in this town called Glen Echo.

607
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,680
- 我们的鬼故事是关于一个叫莱斯利・弗农的…  - 嘘
- Our ghost story is about this man named Leslie Vernon...  - Shh.

608
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:39,040
既然胆小鬼都走了
Now that we've weeded out the gullible, the cowards,

609
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,050
现在该谈谈生意了
I could finish my offer.

610
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,050
五百美元
Five hundred dollars

611
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:48,220
只要今晚跟我把船带回来就可以拿到
just forjoining me forthe night, bringing back my boat.

612
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:53,130
还有五千美元，给取了维克多人头的人
Five thousand dollars for the head of Victor Crowley.

613
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,490
我们连他存不存在都不知道，怎么找到他？
Yeah, but how are we suppose to know if we found him if he's not a real dude?

614
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:59,300
如果你找到了他
If you find him,

615
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,230
你就会知道了
then you'll know.

616
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,890
妈的，你看看这些鳄鱼？
God damn, would you look at all the gators around here?

617
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,130
简直就像个该死的农场
It's like a fucking farm.

618
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,640
我猜牧师说的就是这个
I guess that's what Reverend Zombie's talking about.

619
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,470
这么多鳄鱼
Look at all these.

620
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,740
没人来抓它们
Nobody here to take 'em.

621
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:46,210
我不会空手而归的
Hell, I ain't leaving here empty handed, that's for sure.

622
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,240
你叫什么？
What's your name?

623
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,270
查德
Chad.

624
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,650
克里特斯
Cleatus.

625
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:51,880
真的？
Really?

626
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,320
是啊，我知道
Yeah, I know.

627
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,480
我父母是乡下人
My parents were true rednecks.

628
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,920
我还有个弟弟叫“现金”[Cash]呢
I got a brother named Cash.

629
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,260
比克里特斯酷多了
It's cooler than Cleatus.

630
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,120
没有冒犯的意思
No offense.

631
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,790
没事
None taken.

632
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:05,160
但是，查德，你的名字也够烂的啊
But Chad, that's, uh, that's a real douche bag name.

633
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,190
你说是吗？
You know that, right?

634
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,730
比“偷溜”[Skip]强多了
It's betterthan Skip.

635
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,470
我弟弟就那名字
That's my little brother.

636
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,170
乍得和偷溜？
Chad and Skip?

637
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:16,010
你俩是不是学校光受气了
God damn, you two must have had your asses handed to you in school.

638
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,440
的确如此
Yeah, we did.

639
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,280
我们不跟他们一起坐船怎么样？
So how come we don't get ride in the boat with them boys up there?

640
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,810
去论去哪儿我都开自己的船
I take my own boat wherever I go.

641
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,320
这是为什么？
What the hell for?

642
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,320
万一我泡上妞呢
In case I hook up.

643
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,350
荒郊野外的你泡谁啊？
Who are you gonna hook up with out here?

644
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,720
她
Her.

645
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,090
噢，上了她
Aw, fuck her.

646
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:39,460
饼干、鸡肉和肉汁
Biscuits and chicken and gravy,

647
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:44,400
饼干、鸡肉和肉汁
and biscuits and chicken and gravy,

648
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,140
鸡肉和饼干
and chickens with the biscuits

649
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:53,380
饼干、鸡肉和肉汁
on the gravy with the biscuits and the chicken.

650
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:58,280
我要点饼干，因为饼干就是我
Want some biscuit for the biscuit is me.

651
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,890
带这么一帮暴徒干什么？
So what's with a whole lynch mob?

652
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,790
人多安全
Safety in numbers.

653
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:09,630
我知道他们大多数人觉得那个故事只是个玩笑
I know most of these folks think this whole story is ajoke,

654
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,760
但如果真有状况
but if something bad goes down,

655
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,290
周围有一帮枪手也不错
I'd rather be surrounded by the big guns.

656
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,270
不是吗？
Wouldn't you?

657
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,070
你不是说杀不了他吗？
I thought you said you couldn't kill him?

658
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,470
但如果传说是真的
Ah, but if the legend is true,

659
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:23,530
万一真的有鬼魂
then there really is a ghost or maybe not.

660
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:26,240
昨晚我打伤了他
I hurt him last night.

661
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,150
我开枪打他，捅他烧他
I shot him, I stabbed him, I burned him.

662
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,550
他一个劲向前
He kept coming.

663
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,280
但是你还是伤了他
But you hurt him.

664
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,650
他每次都被击退
He went down every time.

665
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:37,820
都会感到疼痛
He felt pain.

666
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,420
所以或许关键就在于对要打得狠一些
Then maybe the thing is to hit him even worse.

667
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,990
狠狠地打，把他脑袋拧，他就活不了了
Hit him so hard, take his head off, so he can't come back.

668
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:47,130
你叫他什么来着？复活者？
What did you call him, a repeater?

669
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:51,000
那不就意味着他第二天晚上又会回来？
But doesn't that mean that he will just come back again the next night?

670
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,570
我没有答案，只有推断
I don't have answers, only theories.

671
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:58,710
但是我只能这么假设
But I have to assume that, uh, if we take off his head,

672
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:01,110
砍掉脑袋，他就会挂掉
then he can't come back at all.

673
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:06,210
大家处于危险却全然不知
All these people are in danger and they don't even realize it.

674
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,720
老大
Boss.

675
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,980
他，他…嘿，老大！
He-he... hey, boss!

676
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,560
肖恩下船了吗？
Did Shaun get off the boat?

677
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,000
我肯定他们没事
I'm sure they're okay.

678
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,730
所以我们才过来
That's why we're here.

679
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:34,180
嗨？
Sup?

680
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,910
嗨
Hi.

681
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:39,440
我是弗农
I'm Vernon.

682
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:41,250
玛丽贝斯
Marybeth.

683
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:44,450
你到这个鬼地方来干什么？
What you doing out here in this bullshit?

684
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:47,460
总之不是来约会的，我只能说这么多
I'm not looking for a date, I can tell you that much.

685
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,460
哦，无意冒犯，我只是想表示一下友好罢了
Ooh, no disrespect, I'm just trying to be friendly.

686
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,060
抱歉
Sorry.

687
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,130
我刚刚过了很糟糕的一天
I'm just having a really bad day.

688
00:43:55,170 --> 00:44:00,900
你要做的是别这么紧皱着眉头
Well, what you need to do is turn that frown upside down.

689
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,600
谢谢，弗森
Oh, thanks, Vernon.

690
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,470
跟我亲热吧
Make out with me.

691
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,100
什么？
What?

692
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:08,340
在船上当着这么多人？
On this boat, in front of all these people?

693
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:08,870
是的
Yeah.

694
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,280
不要
Don't.

695
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,550
好吧，好吧
Okay, man, okay.

696
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:24,830
船上有怪物，伙计
There're some freaks on this boat, man.

697
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,600
那个小巫婆怎么回事？
What's up with that Blair witch, man?

698
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,870
她的嘴是不是被蜘蛛网封住了
I'd tap that but she probably got cobwebs sealing it up.

699
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,430
如果我能让她开口说话的话
Even if I did hit that,

700
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:33,630
是不是就会有一群蝙蝠从她嘴里飞出来
a bunch of bats probably come flying out of it.

701
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,880
巫毒
Voodoo.

702
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,680
魔法
Magic.

703
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,850
睁大你们的眼睛
Just keep your eyes open.

704
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:47,510
睁大
Open.

705
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,550
今晚会很漫长
This will be a long night.

706
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,510
真是一片死寂
Man, it is dead in here.

707
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,710
我们要去的地方比这里茂密的多
Where we're going, it gets much thicker.

708
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:15,980
快到傍晚了
It's almost nightfall.

709
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:16,980
前进
Let's move!

710
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,300
- 还要多远到房子？ - 什么房子？
- Hey, how much farther to the house?  - What house?

711
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:14,040
我不确定，眼前的景象对我来说都差不多
I'm not exactly sure. This all looks the same to me.

712
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:14,910
我们没走太远
We didn't walk far.

713
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,270
只是不确定在哪儿下船
I'm just not exactly sure where we got off.

714
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:18,570
你们下船干什么？
Why'd you guys get off the boat?

715
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:19,910
我不想逗留
Well, I don't wanna linger.

716
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,920
- 咱们去房子里吧  - 什么房子？
- Let's get to the house.  - What house?

717
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:24,420
我父亲和哥哥在棚子里
My daddy and my brother are in the shed.

718
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:26,320
去棚子里干什么？
Why were they in the shed?

719
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:27,790
什么房子？
What house?

720
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,410
这儿真吓人
It's scary out here.

721
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,320
那是因为别人想要你这么觉得
Oh, that'sjust 'cause people want you to think it's scary.

722
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,950
这和其他沼泽没什么分别
It's no different than any other swamp.

723
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,960
你有没有注意到这里几乎没有鸟儿？
Have you noticed that there's hardly even any birds?

724
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,660
无所谓
Doesn't matter.

725
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,230
别让那个小丑把你唬了
But don't let that clown spook you.

726
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:44,760
你要做的就是在这儿转一晚上
All you gotta do, hang out here for a few hours,

727
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:46,930
然后拿钱回家
collect our money, and go home.

728
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,270
见他的鬼
Screw that.

729
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:50,800
我要灭了克劳利那怪物
I'm taking out that Crowley monster guy.

730
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,540
五千块够我还债了
5000 bucks, I could be out of debt.

731
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:56,610
这儿高手这么多，你想夺魁？
Ha! Out of all these guys, you'll get him?

732
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,170
我比你枪法好
I'm a better shot than you.

733
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,150
才不是呢
That's not true.

734
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:01,680
两年前花园区的那场比赛
Okay, Garden District Fair, two years ago.

735
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,950
我当时喝多了你才赢的
I was drunk and I let you win.

736
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:09,090
就像冰球和游泳比赛那两次一样？
Right, kinda like how you let me win at air hockey and at pool?

737
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:10,890
我当时病了
I was sick.

738
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:12,130
你真可爱
You're adorable.

739
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:15,260
该死的蚊子！
Fucking mosquitoes!

740
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,740
嗨，伙计，我这里有驱蚊水要不
Hey, man. I got some spray if you want.

741
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:19,000
好啊
Yeah.

742
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,100
真好，谢谢
Sweet. Thanks.

743
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,130
你相不相信这个鬼故事啊？
Do you believe the whole ghost story about this place?

744
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,140
我相信那只是个传说
I believe there was a story,

745
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:26,110
但也相信有能伤人的东西
but I believe there's a ghost that can actually hurt somebody.

746
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:29,580
对，我在想
Right. Look, I've been thinking

747
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:33,850
如果鬼魂真的现身伤害我们
if a ghost takes on physical presence and manifests itself,

748
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:36,080
我们怎么阻止他？
then what's to stop it from going after somebody?

749
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,680
你少看点科幻频道的节目吧
Damn, man, you need to stop watching The Syfy Channel.

750
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,850
他要是敢出现，我就打爆他的头
If that ghost does manifest his ass, I'll shoot his head off.

751
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:44,300
来点驱虫水吗？
Hey, man, you want some bug spray?

752
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:47,130
他不怎么爱讲话是吧？
Man, he don't talk a lot, huh?

753
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:48,930
谁啊，约翰？才不是，他很搞笑的
What, who, John? No, man he's a riot.

754
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:51,840
他曾经把假发反着戴，搞笑极了
He used to do stand-up down at Fancy Wigs, man. Real hilarious.

755
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:53,170
- 真的？ - 不
- Seriously?  - No.

756
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:00,250
嘿，伙计，少抽点
Hey, man, careful with 'em cigarettes.

757
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,610
会让你丧命的
They'll kill you, you know.

758
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:03,450
闭嘴，查德
Shut up, Chad.

759
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,450
蠢货！
Dicks!

760
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:10,290
我们到底去哪儿？
Well, where the hell are we going?

761
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,720
我不知道，行吗
I don't know, okay.

762
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,390
我们走的是另一条路
We came in a different way.

763
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:17,860
你到底想让我们走多远，小丫头？
Just how much farther in you expect us to go, little girl?

764
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,870
我要离船近点儿
Yeah. I'd like to stay closer to the boats.

765
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:23,630
我们从那儿过来的，所以船就在正后方
Uh, we came in through there, so the boats are a straight shot back.

766
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:25,260
现在干什么呢？
So what now?

767
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:26,770
包围这一区域
Let's surround the area,

768
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:30,040
如果维克多真的存在，我们就应该在这找到他
if Victor Crowley really does exist, this is where we find him.

769
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,410
这算是维克多的召唤？
So is this some kind of Victor Crowley call or something?

770
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:40,850
现在呢，兵分几路？
So, what, we break up into groups?

771
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:42,250
不
No.

772
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:43,420
那不是个好主意
That's a bad idea.

773
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,860
不，他是对的
No, no. He's right.

774
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:47,160
那样的话我们就能走到更多地方
That way, we can cover more ground.

775
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:50,890
如果看见那怪物就开枪
All right now, if you see that monster out there, shoot.

776
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:53,870
等一下
Now, wait just a damn minute.

777
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:57,840
我可不希望一群吓坏了的人朝周围乱开枪
We don't want a bunch of spooked people walking around this swamp shooting at everything.

778
00:48:57,870 --> 00:49:00,430
你说谁吓坏了？
Man, who you calling spooked?

779
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:01,340
我跟大个儿一起
I'm going with the big guy.

780
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,370
滚一边去
The fuck you are, boy.

781
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:05,380
别妨碍我赚钱
I'm fixin' to keep a eye on my money.

782
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:07,310
咱们快点找到那个棚子然后离开这儿
Come on, let's find that shed and get out of here.

783
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:08,410
等一下
Hey, wait a minute.

784
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:09,850
等一下
Wait a minute!

785
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,820
有什么计划吗？
What's the plan?

786
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:12,380
计划？
The plan?

787
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:15,010
日出之后船上集合
We meet back at the boat at sun up.

788
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:19,890
找到怪物，带他的头回来…五千块
And if you do find that monster, bring back his head... 5K.

789
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:21,790
特伦特，你跟我们一其
Trent, you come with us.

790
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,430
你要干什么？
What do you want to do?

791
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:38,070
今晚跟这些人呆在一起
Stick with these guys tonight.

792
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:40,010
等到明天，然后出去
Wait here till tomorrow and get out of here.

793
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:45,520
好了，这个猎人是艾迪老爹
Well, all right, this hunter's Daddy Eddy.

794
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:47,950
我不想整晚跟这些傻瓜在一起
I don't want to hang out with these idiots all night.

795
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,990
好吧，跟我来
All right, come on.

796
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:56,630
哇，哇，嘿，兄弟，你要带着美女去沼泽？
Whoa-whoa, hey, man, what, you're going to take the pretty thing in the swamp with you?

797
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,560
是的，我们没事
Yeah, man. We're cool.

798
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,860
多谢
Thanks.

799
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,960
懂了
Oh, okay, I get it.

800
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,030
你们是一对儿对吧？
Y'all a couple or something, huh?

801
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,170
是我不好
My bad.

802
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:09,770
伙计，我有个想法，我们分开怎么样？
Hey man, I got an idea. Why don't we all just split up?

803
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:12,210
嗨，咱们去裸泳吧？
Hey, better yet, let'sjust go skinny dipping.

804
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,370
嘿，我不认识你
Hey, I don't know about you.

805
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:17,510
我要抓一条鳄鱼，在船这儿等着
I'm gonna go catch me a gator, hang out down by the boats.

806
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:20,150
我喜欢在船那儿等着
Well, I like the idea of sticking near them boats.

807
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:22,210
不过别丢下我
I don't want nobody leaving without me.

808
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:25,490
跟着我混，不吃亏
Stick with me, pal. Make it worth our while.

809
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:33,530
就剩咱们俩了
And then, it wasjust us.

810
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,660
害怕不？
Are you scared, man?

811
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,180
嘘！
Boo!

812
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:00,850
哦！
Ow.

813
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:04,920
妈的！
Damn it!

814
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:09,130
满沼泽的鳄鱼我居然打不中一条！
Swamp overflowing with gators and I can't hit one!

815
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:10,660
你得先引诱它过来
You gotta lead it more.

816
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,540
伙计，我知道怎么打猎
Dude, I know how to hunt.

817
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,670
是啊，所以才会不停的射空
Yeah. That's why you keep missing.

818
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:21,040
咱们就在这儿站一晚上吗？
So, uh, are we supposed to stand around here all night?

819
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,880
除非你想跟那帮混蛋呆在一起
Unless you want to go sniffing around in there with them assholes.

820
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,250
不
No, no.

821
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:29,660
呆在这儿倒没什么，但是五千块啊…
I'm good here but, man, 5000 bucks...

822
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:32,020
抓一个小孩子讲的故事里的人？
To hunt down a children story?

823
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,320
祝你好运！
Good luck!

824
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,020
祖比之所以悬赏那么多
And the only reason Zombie's even offering that reward,

825
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:39,690
是因为根本就不存在维克多・克劳利
because there ain't no Victor Crowley.

826
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:41,700
我们就是呆一晚上
I mean, we're gonna end up staying up all night

827
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:45,500
然后回去宣布沼泽已经清理过了
just so we can go back and declare the swamp safe and

828
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:48,700
他好能宣传旅游罢了
be able to start up his tours or some bullshit.

829
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,540
你怎么知道故事不是真的？
How do you know the story ain't real?

830
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,040
拜托
Please.

831
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,570
如果是真的…
If that story was real...

832
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,710
我是说如果我觉得故事是真的
I mean, if I even thought that story was real,

833
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,510
我就不会过来了
my ass wouldn't be here right now.

834
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:03,680
好吧，看见它在往右边挪了吗？
All right, see how he's moving to the right?

835
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,990
闭嘴
Shut up.

836
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:06,990
向右游了两英尺
Two feet to the right.

837
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:08,490
闭嘴
Shut up.

838
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,190
耶！哇噢！
Yeah! Whoo!

839
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:13,030
看到没？
Did you see that?

840
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:14,560
等着，闭嘴
Wait. Shut up.

841
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:16,200
你听到声音了吗？
Did you hear something?

842
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:20,700
- 我听到鳄鱼说要跟我回家  - 不是的！嘘！
- Yeah, I heard that gator decide to come home with me, that's what I heard.  - No! Shh!

843
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,330
听
Listen.

844
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,290
哦，得了
Oh, come on.

845
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,580
好吧，我们能够听到你弗农，真好笑
All right, we hear you Vernon. It's funny.

846
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:39,650
是弗农吗？
That was Vernon?

847
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:40,990
当然
Of course, it was.

848
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,760
我看到他了
I see him.

849
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,660
闭嘴
Shut the fuck up.

850
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:47,320
就在我们前面
It's out in front of us.

851
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,560
弗农？
Vernon?

852
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:53,470
别闹了，不然你会挨枪子儿的
Cut it out or you're gonna get hurt.

853
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:55,770
好的
Yeah.

854
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:57,970
我没跟你闹
I'm serious.

855
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,410
马上住口，不然我开枪了
Knock it off right now or you're gonna get shot.

856
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,390
我真开枪了啊
I'm serious now.

857
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,590
哦，靠！
Oh! Oh, fuck!

858
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:17,150
不！不！不！
No! No! No!

859
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,720
不！
No!

860
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,150
老大，等等
Hey, boss, hold on.

861
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:14,380
怎么
Come on.

862
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:18,720
我们到底干什么来了？
What are we really doing here?

863
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,960
穿过这里，找到船上的人
We're gonna go through there, get the people that were on that boat,

864
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,230
把他们带回家
and we're gonna bring them back home.

865
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,860
少来，我不是傻瓜
Come on. I'm not an idiot, okay.

866
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,600
为什么要这么多人，带这么多枪？
Why do you need all these people? Why all the guns?

867
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,040
好吧
All right,

868
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,600
听我说，贾斯汀
listen to me, Justin.

869
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,570
听我说
Listen to me.

870
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:38,670
如果那女孩说的是真的，维克多还在这里
If what the girl is saying is correct and Victor Crowley is still out there,

871
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:40,340
我知道怎么弄死他
I know how to get rid of him.

872
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,280
怎么结束诅咒
I know how to end the curse.

873
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,510
怎么做？
And how is that?

874
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:45,850
- 看见前面的两个人了吗？ - 是的
- You see those two right there?  - Yeah.

875
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:48,720
克劳利被杀死那天晚上他们就在那儿
They were out here the night that Crowley got murdered.

876
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,310
房子被点着那晚？？
Oh, the night the house got lit on fire?

877
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,760
是的
Yes.

878
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:53,350
他们有三个人
There were three of them.

879
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:56,490
萨姆森，那女孩儿的父亲也在其中
Samson, the girl's father, was the other one.

880
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:58,860
也就是说杀了他俩，维克多就罢手了
So that means there's only two more to go

881
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:01,330
他的仇就报了
before his revenge is satisfied

882
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:05,430
诅咒解除，沼泽就是我的
and the curse will be lifted, and the swamp is mine.

883
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:08,700
等等，这有点像谋杀
Wait. That's... that's like murder.

884
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,370
我伤害任何人了吗？
Am I hurting anybody?

885
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:14,510
我强迫任何人来了吗？
Did I twist anybody's arm to come out here?

886
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,520
他们都是自愿的
They came here on their own free will.

887
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:18,580
因为你收买了他们
Yeah, because you bribed them.

888
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,190
你有意见？
You got a problem with this, Justin?

889
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,710
对我有意见？
Do you have a problem with me?

890
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,420
我…
Ljust...

891
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,450
没意见
No.

892
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:34,430
我只想找到肖恩然后离开
Look, I just wanna find Shaun and get the hell out of here.

893
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:36,130
肖恩还好吗？
Is Shaun all right?

894
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:43,110
不知道
I don't know.

895
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,610
就算你知道也不会告诉我对吧？
But you wouldn't tell me the truth if you did know, would you?

896
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:47,510
看着我
Look at me.

897
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:50,850
那女孩儿也不知道肖恩的情况
The girl doesn't know what happened to Shaun either.

898
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,510
队伍走散了
The group got split up.

899
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:55,110
但我确定他一定在什么地方
But I'm sure he's out there somewhere.

900
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,060
他会没事的，相信我
He'll be fine. Trust me.

901
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:59,180
我们现在必须团结
Now we all have to stick together.

902
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,560
一切都会没事的
Everything is going to be fine.

903
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,060
他很强的
He's a tough kid.

904
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:06,160
他没那么强
He ain't that tough.

905
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:29,210
快点！
Come on.

906
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:35,990
快点！
Come on.

907
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:54,440
啊！
Ah.

908
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,340
你一点也不想溜走？
You're not the least bit creeped out here?

909
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:26,740
你真的害怕？
You're really freaked out, huh?

910
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,650
是的
Well, yeah.

911
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,340
没必要害怕
You don't need to be scared.

912
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:41,960
而且就算真的有怪物扑过来
Besides, if a monster comes to get you,

913
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,460
我们有枪呢，对吧？
we've got guns, right?

914
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,620
我猜是的
I guess.

915
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:59,140
还记得高中时候吗
Remember... remember in high school,

916
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:01,670
我告诉你我病了所以没法考驾照
when I told you I couldn't get my driver's license because I was sick

917
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,110
最后没拿到驾照？
and couldn't make it to the DMV?

918
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,120
是的
Yeah.

919
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:06,990
我说谎了
I lied.

920
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:08,180
我考试没通过
And I failed.

921
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,950
教练叫我平行停车但我却撞上了别的车
Guy told me to parallel park and I totally nailed the other car.

922
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:14,520
怎么想起说这个？
Where did that come from?

923
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,620
我也不知道
I don't know.

924
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:18,320
只是想说而已
I guess I... I just felt like saying it.

925
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:21,330
想知道些秘密吗？
Want to know something?

926
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:22,960
什么？
What?

927
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,270
我知道的
I knew.

928
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:24,790
怎么知道的？
How?

929
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,170
记得我姑姑吗？
Remember my Aunt May?

930
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:28,730
她在汽车管理部工作，都告诉我了
She worked at the DMV. She told me the whole thing.

931
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,330
- 真的？ - 是的
- Really?  - Yeah.

932
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,910
为什么一直不跟我说？
Then why didn't you ever call me on it?

933
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:41,580
因为我当时喜欢你，不想你出丑
'Cause I had a crush on you and I felt bad, I guess.

934
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,080
别说了
Stop.

935
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,520
不
No.

936
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,900
你知道我仍然关心你吧？
Wait, you know I still care about you, right?

937
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,600
我…我…我不知道这算什么
I don't... I don't... I don't know what's going on.

938
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:07,910
管他呢
Fuck it.

939
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:19,390
这儿！在这儿
Here! It's here.

940
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:20,830
他们在这儿
They're in here.

941
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:28,560
他们本在这里的
They were here.

942
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:32,040
他们两个的尸体
Both of them, their bodies were right here.

943
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:34,130
嘘，没事的
Shh, it's okay.

944
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:36,970
嘘，嘘，嘘
Shh, shh, shh.

945
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:38,340
高兴了？
Are you happy now?

946
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:41,180
我只是来帮忙的
Hey, I'm just trying to help.

947
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:42,410
我确定他们就在这儿的
Look, I'm sure they were here,

948
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:44,820
现在却什么都没有了
but, look, there's nothing here now!

949
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:46,790
就在这儿
They were right there.

950
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,950
或许是另一个房子吧？
Well then, maybe... maybe it was a different shed.

951
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:51,360
- 或许你惊吓过度  - 不，我看见了
- Maybe you were just scared.  - No, I know what I saw.

952
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:54,590
我亲眼所见
I saw them with my own eyes.

953
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:59,620
或许维克多把他们带进屋里了
Crowley, maybe... maybe he took them inside the house.

954
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:00,630
玛丽贝斯！
Marybeth!

955
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:02,640
这个女孩儿吓坏了…
Hey, the girl's had quite a scare...

956
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:06,870
勇敢的姑娘
Brave little gal.

957
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:08,600
嘿，你们不能进去！
Hey, you just can't run up there!

958
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,730
随他们去吧
Oh, let them go.

959
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:16,170
老板，你不介意的话，我想是时候找我弟弟了
Boss, if you don't mind, I'd really like tojust find my brother

960
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:17,550
完事早点儿离开
and get the fuck out of here.

961
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:20,610
不行，大家在一起才安全
No, it's safer if we stick together.

962
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:21,920
肖恩！
Shaun!

963
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,420
- 肖恩！ - 孩子
- Shaun!  - Son,

964
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:26,480
我再给你最后一次警告，别喊了
I'm gonna give you about one more second to knock that shit off.

965
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:30,790
妈的
Fuck.

966
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:33,090
喜欢吗？
You like that?

967
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,330
是的
Yes.

968
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:36,300
是的
Yes. Fuck.

969
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,740
哦耶
Oh, yeah.

970
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:38,830
怀念吗？
Did you miss that?

971
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:39,770
是的，确实怀念
I did. I really did.

972
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:41,300
有多怀念？
Oh, how much? How much you missed it?

973
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,930
相当的
The most.

974
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:44,440
没法更怀念了
The most amount.

975
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,780
比冰激凌更爽吧？
You like this better than ice cream?

976
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:47,300
是的
Yep.

977
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:48,540
哦耶
Oh, yeah.

978
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:50,740
- 比巧克力冰激凌也爽？ - 是的
- Better than chocolate ice cream?  - Yep.

979
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:51,980
去他妈的巧克力冰激凌
Fuck chocolate ice cream.

980
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,450
哦耶
Oh, yeah.

981
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:55,280
爱这个胜过耶稣？
You like this better than Jesus?

982
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:58,420
这话不太合适
That'sjust... that's not appropriate.

983
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:00,860
比小耶稣呢？
Oh, you like this better than Baby Jesus?

984
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:06,130
差不多吧
Ah, about... about an equal amount.

985
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:07,630
哦耶
Oh, yeah.

986
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:09,430
爱我吗？
You love me?

987
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:12,170
什么？
What?

988
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,730
你爱我吗？
Do you love me?

989
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:14,600
是
Yep.

990
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:18,640
有多爱？
How much do you love me?

991
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:20,870
爱
Yep.

992
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:25,080
- 什么？我听不见  - 嗯？
- What? I can't hear you.  - Huh?

993
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,520
说你爱我
Tell me you love me.

994
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:29,210
我爱你
I love you.

995
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:31,620
说，说你爱我
Say it. Say you love me.

996
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:36,490
说
Say it!

997
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:38,050
- 说你爱我！ - 我爱你
- Tell me you love me!  - I love you.

998
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:40,000
我爱你，我爱你
I love you. I love you.

999
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,370
真的
Yeah, you do.

1000
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,660
噢！
Oh!

1001
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:46,900
就这样
Easy!

1002
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:54,840
继续
C'mon!

1003
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,410
继续啊
C'mon!

1004
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:57,420
用力
Come on.

1005
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:59,880
你不是又睡着了吧？
You didn't fall asleep on me again, did you?

1006
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:04,780
上帝啊！
Oh, my God!

1007
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:08,150
上帝啊！上帝啊！
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1008
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,100
够了！
Enough!

1009
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:53,200
受够你们的神经了
Enough of this insanity. Come on.

1010
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,470
他们在这儿
They're here.

1011
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:56,100
他们一定在某什么地方
They have to be here somewhere.

1012
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:57,580
我们现在就离开
Come on, we're leaving right now.

1013
01:02:57,610 --> 01:02:59,810
求你了，鲍勃叔叔，请相信我
Please, please, Uncle Bobby, you have to believe me.

1014
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:01,940
明天白天来
Well, then, we'll come back tomorrow during the day.

1015
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,570
让警察一起来
We'll bring the sheriff with us.

1016
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:04,210
老大！
Boss!

1017
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:05,340
警察不会来的…
The sheriff isn't gonna be here...

1018
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:08,120
我现在就想离开！
I really wanna get out of here now!

1019
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:09,210
还不可以
Not yet.

1020
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:10,720
吓死我了
Please. I'm fucking scared.

1021
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,390
那就回船上去
Then get back to the boat.

1022
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:15,020
我可以拿着钥匙回去吗？
Can I get the keys back?

1023
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,700
把我留这儿？
And leave me here?

1024
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:21,100
不，我不走，我要等着
No. I won't leave. I'll wait.

1025
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:22,830
你也要
The hell you will.

1026
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:25,040
我会和你在一起
I'm with your boy.

1027
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:27,670
我们在这儿是自找麻烦
We're looking for serious trouble being in here.

1028
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,240
太迟了
It's too late.

1029
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,300
关上门！
Shut the door!

1030
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:36,850
关上门！
Shut the fucking door!

1031
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:41,950
帮我一把
Come on, give me a hand.

1032
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:43,150
来啊，来啊，来啊，来啊！
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!

1033
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:44,590
来啊，来啊
Come on, come on.

1034
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,330
加油
Come on, man.

1035
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:48,680
推，快推
Come on push, push fast.

1036
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,160
你们到底做了什么？
What the hell have you done?

1037
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,170
离我远点，老头
Back off of me, old man.

1038
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,000
你要让我们所有人都被杀死吗？
You're gonna get us all killed?

1039
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,630
你？
You?

1040
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,300
你在指责我？
You're blaming me?

1041
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:02,310
什么？
What?

1042
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:03,670
你做说什么？
What are you talking about?

1043
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:05,470
你最好闭嘴！
Y'all better shot the fuck up!

1044
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:09,610
嘿，你们听到了吗？
Hey, man, you hear that?

1045
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:17,250
嘿，别开这种玩笑
Hey, if somebody's joking around out there, this shit ain't funny.

1046
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:18,550
我们会朝你开枪的
We will shoot you.

1047
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:29,160
出来，不然我们会把你的头打下来
Show yourself or we will shoot your head off.

1048
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,790
最后一次警告！
Last warning, asshole!

1049
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:55,390
开枪
Shots fired.

1050
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:56,590
或许他们打到他了
Maybe they got him.

1051
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:58,430
别去，呆在我这儿
No, no. Stay with me.

1052
01:04:58,470 --> 01:04:59,190
不
No.

1053
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:02,200
我不能，我不能呆在这儿
Look, I can't. Look, I can't. I can't be in here.

1054
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,260
或者我回船上去
Or I need to get back to the boat.

1055
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,100
我只是想找到肖恩回家
I just wanna find Shaun and go home.

1056
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:11,670
肖恩…他死了没？
Shaun... is he, is he dead?

1057
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:14,100
他们都死了
They are all dead.

1058
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:14,980
你骗了我们？
And you lied?

1059
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:16,810
我早告诉他了
I told him the truth.

1060
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:18,720
你知道我弟弟死了！
You knew my brother was dead!

1061
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,580
安静
Quiet, kid!

1062
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:24,650
这个疯婆子也就告诉我这么多
All right, all I know is what that crazy gal said.

1063
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:27,130
你弟弟一定在什么地方
For all I know he could still be out there somewhere.

1064
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:31,300
他没有
He's not.

1065
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:35,000
要是他们误伤了然怎么办？
Well, what if you shot one of the other guys, man?

1066
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:36,230
有人吗？
Hello?

1067
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:49,410
怎么了？！
What the fuck?!

1068
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,270
妈的！
Oh, shit!

1069
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:37,430
真他妈倒霉！
We're fucked in here!

1070
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:39,590
他妈的倒霉！
We're fucked. We're so fucked!

1071
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:41,760
听我说你这个胆小鬼
Listen to me you little piece of shit.

1072
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,600
现在好好跟着我，别做傻事
Now you stay with me and you don't do anything stupid.

1073
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:45,830
如果我猜的没错
Now if I'm right

1074
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:49,140
克劳利杀了他俩报了仇
and Crowley gets his revenge on those two people that killed him.

1075
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:50,610
他就不会再杀人了
He's gonna have his peace.

1076
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,770
一切就结束了我们就富有了
This will all be over and we'll be rich.

1077
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:55,300
- 万一…  - 别傻了
- What if...  - Don't be a fool.

1078
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:57,750
和我呆在一起
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1079
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:04,480
把枪给我
Give me your gun.

1080
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,550
不！
No!

1081
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,850
看到什么东西了吗？
Do you see anything out there?

1082
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,060
没有
No.

1083
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:13,590
但是恐怕这不是屋子的唯一入口
But I find it hard to believe that this door is the only way in.

1084
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:14,930
我去看看
I'll scope it out.

1085
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:18,830
听我说，你藏起来
Now, you listen to me. I want you to hide.

1086
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:19,930
不要
I'm not hiding.

1087
01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:21,130
够了
That's enough.

1088
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:22,370
马上藏起来！
Now you hide!

1089
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:24,470
快
Come on.

1090
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:25,700
快
Come on!

1091
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:01,340
我这辈子没这么害怕过
I've never been so fucking scared in my life.

1092
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:09,010
你哥哥的事深表遗憾
I'm sorry about your brother.

1093
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:11,520
你本可以早告诉我
You could have told me earlier.

1094
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:13,580
我以为祖比会告诉你
I thought Zombie would have told you.

1095
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:21,760
你确定？
Are you positive?

1096
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,700
确定他死了？
But are you sure he's dead?

1097
01:08:26,110 --> 01:08:27,900
你怎么回来的？
Why the hell would you come back here?

1098
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:28,870
我不明白
I don't understand.

1099
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:30,930
我家人死了
My family is gone.

1100
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:32,470
一无所有了
I have nothing.

1101
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:37,320
我要维克多死
I wanna see Crowley die.

1102
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:40,340
- 但如果他是鬼…  - 我昨晚打伤他了
- But if he's a ghost...  - I hurt him last night.

1103
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:42,820
如果他能感受到痛，就能打死
If he can feel pain, then he can die.

1104
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:48,720
他和你说什么？
What did he say to you?

1105
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:53,660
我听见他说“他们两个”？
I heard him say something about "those two"?

1106
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:59,470
好像是特伦特和你叔叔…
He seems to think that Trent and that guy with you, your uncle...

1107
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,270
鲍勃？
Bob?

1108
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:05,540
他说他们是多年以前杀死维克多的人
He says that they're with your father when they killed Victor Crowley years ago.

1109
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:06,600
什么？
What?

1110
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:12,480
他说如果维克多杀了他们俩
He thinks that if Victor Crowley has his revenge on them that

1111
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:16,960
诅咒就解除了，一切都安全了
the curse will be lifted and he'll just go away, and they will be safe.

1112
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:19,050
所以把他们带了进来？
That's why he brought us here?

1113
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:20,150
我什么都不知道
I don't know shit.

1114
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:22,220
- 我只知道…  - 鲍勃叔叔！
- All I know is...  - Uncle Bob!

1115
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,850
嘿，不要！嘿！
Hey, no! Hey!

1116
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:54,820
蜘蛛
Spiders.

1117
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:00,790
妈的
Oh, shit.

1118
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:03,090
蜘蛛
Oh, please, spiders.

1119
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:04,190
妈的
Please.

1120
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:07,560
妈的！
Oh, fuck!

01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:28,950
鲍勃叔叔！鲍勃叔叔！
Uncle Bob! Uncle Bob!

1122
01:11:28,990 --> 01:11:29,960
这是个圈套！
It's a trap!

1123
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:30,480
什么？
What?

1124
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:32,180
祖比牧师，他要…
Reverend Zombie, he's trying to get...

1125

他在屋子里！
He's in the house!

1126
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,460
等下！不要！不不，等等！
Wait, no! No, no, wait! Wait!

1127
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:50,430
杀了我吧！
Just kill me!

1128
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,510
哦…哦，上帝啊！
Oh... Oh, God!

1129
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,410
鲍勃叔叔，求你了！别去！
Uncle Bob, please! Don't go!

1130
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:07,120
他就是想让你去呢
This is what he wants.

1131
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,180
请听我说
Please listen to me.

鲍勃叔叔，起来

把她放下！
Put her down!

1147
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:35,640
你要干什么！

几十年前放火的三个孩子

三个害死了维克多・克劳利的孩子

你是个杀人犯

你就没想过要帮我
You never wanted to help me.

那不是我的亲叔叔
