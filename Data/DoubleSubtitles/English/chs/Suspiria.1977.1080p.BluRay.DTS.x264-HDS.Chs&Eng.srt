这场雨已经下很久了吗？

下半小时了

20
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,450
请你等我一分钟好吗？
Can you wait a minute, please?

21
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,210
- 哈罗？ - 是谁？
- Hello?  - Who is it?

22
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,700
苏西邦妮，我刚从纽约来的
Suzy Bannion. I just got in from New York.

23
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,200
- 我不认识你，走开！ - 但我有你们寄给我的信
- I don't know you. Go away!  - But I have the letter you sent.

24
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,710
听着，外面下这么大的雨，你让我进去，我会解释
Look, it's really raining hard. You could just let me in and I'll explain.

25
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,200
- 走开，走开！ - 但你不明白！
- Go away. Go away!  - But you don't understand!

26
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,210
等等！等一下，等等
Wait! Wait a minute. Wait.

27
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,700
哈罗，有人在那里吗？
Hello. Is anybody there?

28
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,700
哈罗？
Hello?

29
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:14,950
如果你喜欢沙发，你可以待到你高兴为止
If you're happy enough with the couch, you can stay for as long as you please.

30
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,450
谢谢，但我早上就会离开
Thanks, but I'll be leaving in the morning.

31
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,450
- 我会永远离开此地  - 喔，了不起，孩子
- I'm going away forever.  - Oh, big deal, kid.

32
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,950
你被学校退学了又怎么样？
So what if you've been thrown out of school?

33
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,950
我从幼稚园就老是被学校退学
I always got kicked out of school, beginning in kindergarten.

34
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,450
不，不是那样，我不在乎被退学
No, that's not it. I don't give a damn about getting kicked out.

35
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,700
那么呢？
Well, then?

36
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,200
跟你解释是没有用的
It's useless to try and explain it to you.

37
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,200
你不会了解的
You wouldn't understand.

38
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,700
所有事情似乎太…荒谬了
It all seems so...Absurd,

39
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,700
太难以置信了
So fantastic.

40
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,620
我所能做的就是尽快离开这里
All I can do is get away from here as soon as possible.

41
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,700
你介意我借用你的浴室吗？我想要把身体弄干
Would you mind if I used the bathroom? I'd like to dry off.

42
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,110
当然不介意，去吧
No, of course not. Go ahead.

43
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,120
嘿，你为什么不把它关上？
Hey, why don't you close it?

44
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,110
这样比较好，只是风而已
That's better. It was just the wind.

45
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,120
你看起来的确很糟
You sure are in bad shape.

46
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:32,440
你必须告诉我所有的事情
You have to tell me all about it.

47
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,450
风！窗户被吹开了
The wind! The windows burst open.

48
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,950
- 我吓到了  - 不，不是那个
- I got scared.  - No. That's not it.

49
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,440
我是说，什么事让你这么紧张？
I mean, what it is that's got you so upset.

50
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,440
好吧，你可以晚一点告诉我
Okay, you can tell me about it later.

51
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,780
让我进去！佩特！
Let me in! Pat!

52
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,520
佩特！佩特！
Pat! Pat!

53
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,600
帮帮我！帮帮我！这里发生了谋杀案！
Help me! Help me! There's a murderer!

54
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:31,280
帮帮我！帮帮忙！这里发生了谋杀案！
Help me! Help! There's a murderer!

55
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,610
帮帮我！帮帮忙！
Help me! Help!

56
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,020
不！不！不！
No! No! No!

57
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,860
帮帮我！
Help me!

58
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,860
帮帮忙！
Help!

59
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,100
这里发生了谋杀案！
There's a murderer!

60
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,940
不！
No!

61
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,840
- 早安  - 早安，丹尼尔
- Good morning.  - Good morning, Daniel.

62
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,850
早安，坦娜小姐
Good morning, miss Tanner.

63
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,770
- 早安，我能帮你什么吗？ - 是的，我是苏西邦妮
- Good morning. May I help you?  - Yes, I'm Suzy Bannion.

64
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,760
我们以为你昨天晚上会到，你在信上…
We expected you yesterday evening. You wrote us that...

65
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,260
对，我昨晚十点来到这里
Right. I did arrive last night about 10:00.

66
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,270
但是大门被锁起来，而且有人在对讲机里说…
But the door was locked, and somebody on the call box...

67
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,760
她不知道我是谁，所以不能让我进去
Said they didn't know who I was and couldn't let me in.

68
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:59,260
- 是谁这样对你说的？ - 我不知道，她没说她的名字
- Who said that to you?  - I don't know. She didn't say her name.

69
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,270
我很抱歉，但不管怎样，你来到我们这里了
I'm so sorry. At any rate, Now you're here among us,

70
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:06,760
欢迎来到我们的学院，我是坦娜小姐，这所学院的老师
So welcome to our academy. I'm miss Tanner, one of the instructors.

71
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,760
很高兴认识你
Nice to meet you.

72
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,770
请跟我来，我来跟你介绍布兰克夫人
Come along. I'd like to introduce you to madame Blanc,

73
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,770
我们的副校长
Our vice directress.

74
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,760
她是著名的芭蕾舞者
She was a very famous ballerina.

75
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,760
- 布兰克夫人  - 什么事？
- Madame Blanc?  - Yes?

76
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,100
苏西邦妮，我们的新学生
Suzy Bannion, our new student.

77
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,850
喔，是的
Oh, yes.

78
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,760
- 失陪了，先生们  - 好的，夫人
- Excuse me, gentlemen.  - Of course, madame.

79
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:33,770
你很漂亮，的确非常漂亮，他们是警察
You're pretty. Very pretty indeed. They're policemen.

80
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:38,260
我几年前在纽约认识一位邦妮女士，卡洛·邦妮
I knew a woman called Bannion years ago in New York. Carol Bannion.

81
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,270
- 她是我的阿姨  - 好极了！她是一位非凡的女人
- She's my aunt.  - Good! She's a marvelous woman,

82
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,770
她是我的朋友，赞助很多地方的艺术家
A friend and benefactress of artists everywhere.

83
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:47,260
我很高兴在这里教导她的侄女
I'm delighted to have her niece here.

84
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,350
我以我们学院女校长之名欢迎你的到来
Well, I offer our academy's official welcome in the name of our directress,

85
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,850
很遗憾她此刻不在学校
Who unfortunately is not here at the moment.

86
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,340
- 她目前在国外旅行  - 谢谢
- She's traveling abroad.  - Thank you.

87
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,350
艾伯特，请在楼上等我
Albert, please wait for me upstairs.

88
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,350
他是我的侄子，我非常喜欢他
He's my nephew. I'm very attached to him.

89
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,340
我必须尽快跟你说完…
I must tell you what I have to say very quickly...

90
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,840
因为那些先生正在等我
Because those gentlemen are waiting for me.

91
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,850
发生了一件非常可怕的事情
Something terrible, truly horrible, has happened.

92
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:14,840
我们的学生佩特·辛葛，昨天刚因为不当行为被退学
One of our students, Pat Hingle, who was expelled just yesterday for improper conduct,

93
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,100
然后昨晚被某个疯子杀了，这真是一件可怕的事
Was murdered last night by some madman. It's a frightening story.

94
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,600
不过我经常告诫我的学生，不是吗，坦娜小姐？
But I always warn our students, Don't I, miss Tanner?

95
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,090
我告诉她们要小心，不要交上不好的朋友
I tell them to be careful, not to get involved with questionable friendships.

96
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,100
我想跟你说，目前你的房间还没有空出来
What I wanted to tell you was that your room here isn't free yet.

97
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,100
- 只是一个小问题  - 是的，不过你不用担心
- Just a slight hitch.  - Yes, but don't worry.

98
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,590
我们为你在城里找到一个地方，和我们三年级的学生住在一起
We've found you a place to stay with one of our third-year students who lives in town.

99
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,100
你每个星期要付五十美元的房租
You'll have to pay 50 of your American dollars a week,

100
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,090
这是一个便宜的价钱，而且可以从你的学费中扣除
But it's a good price, and you can deduct it from your fee here.

101
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,590
现在我将你交给坦娜小姐照顾，她是我们这里资深的老师
Now I entrust you to the care of miss Tanner, one of our veteran teachers here.

102
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:50,600
她似乎有点严肃，但不要觉得不安，这只是她的作风，她对我也是这样的
Don't be upset if she seems a little stern or surly. It's only her manner. She's even that way with me.

103
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,590
她真的是一位优秀的老师
She really is an invaluable teacher.

104
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:58,010
- 跟我来  - 现在，先生们…
- Come with me.  - And now, gentlemen...

105
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,260
就如你所知，你必须修习三年
As you know, our courses last three years,

106
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,760
而且你要通过每学年末的考试
And you must pass an exam at the end of each year.

107
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,760
所以这名女孩是晚上大约十一点离开学校的吗？
So, the girl left the school About 11:00 in the evening?

108
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,760
- 据我所知是的  - 抱歉
- That's my information.  - Excuse me.

109
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,260
昨晚大约十一点我来到这里时，我看到一个女孩离开学校
When I got here last night about 11:00, I saw a girl leaving the school.

110
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,760
她是新学生，刚刚到达，她的外貌呢？
She's a new student. She just arrived. What did she look like?

111
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,760
她有一头金发和穿着一件棕色雨衣
Well, she had blonde hair and was wearing a brown raincoat.

112
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,260
- 她做了什么？ - 我不知道，我只在雨中看到她一会儿
- What did she do?  - I don't know. I only saw her for a minute in a storm.

113
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,250
那么你知道了吧？真的是十一点
So you see? It really was 11:00.

114
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,260
来吧？
Coming?

115
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,260
我们这里不教你怎么去跳舞，因为我们认为我们学生都已经知道了
We don't teach you how to dance here, because we presume our students already know how.

116
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,260
这是一所专门为培养专家而建立的学院
This is an established academy dedicated to specializing.

117
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,260
这是帕罗斯，我们学校的工友
This is Pavlos, our general handyman.

118
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,010
他很丑，不是吗？不用害怕这么说
He's really ugly, isn't he? don't be afraid to say so.

119
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,840
反正他听不懂你说什么，他只会罗马尼亚语
He can't understand you, anyway. He speaks only Romanian.

120
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,340
你看到他迷人的微笑吗？在他牙齿坏掉之前曾经非常的英俊
You see that gorgeous smile? He's been very handsome ever since he got those false teeth.

121
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,340
去年他发现自己有牙龈炎
Last year, he discovered He had gingivitis of the gums,

122
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,840
所以他拔掉所有的牙齿
So he had all his teeth pulled.

123
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,840
一天早上拔掉了上排牙齿，第二天，下排牙齿也都拔掉了
The top row one morning. The bottom row a day later.

124
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,840
砰！
Bang.

125
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,340
- 我们要去哪里？ - 去更衣室
- Where are we going?  - To the locker room.

126
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,840
我们学校也有一个游泳池，你可以在任何时间使用
We also have a swimming pool, which you can use when you want.

127
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,760
坦娜小姐，我有一些事要告诉你
Miss Tanner. I have something to tell you.

128
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,760
- 嘶嘎，嘶嘎，波丽鹦鹉  - 谁那样说的？闭嘴！
- Squawk, squawk. Polly parrot.  - Who said that? Shut up.

129
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,250
大家已经玩够这些游戏了吧
That's enough of these little games for the moment.

130
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,260
我向你们介绍我们的新同学，苏西·邦妮
I want to introduce Suzy Bannion, our new student.

131
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:36,260
你会找到几位也从美国来的女孩，例如米莉安
You'll find several fellow Americans among these girls...Miriam, for one.

132
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,250
- 你好  - 嗨，你的衣物柜在那里
- Hello.  - Hi. Your locker's over there.

133
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,760
除了舞鞋之外，柜子里什么都有
You'll find everything in there except shoes.

134
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,760
今天你可以先跟有两双舞鞋的人借
For today, you can borrow shoes from someone who has two pairs.

135
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,750
大家快一点，我会在红色房间等你们所有人
Hurry up, everybody. I'll be waiting for all of you in the red room.

136
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,760
跟我来吧
Come with me.

137
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,760
玛塔哈莉要去打小报告了
Mata Hari is going to file her report.

138
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,260
我的名字是欧嘉，你是我的房客
My name is Olga, and you're my tenant.

139
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,260
喔，嗨，很高兴认识你
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

140
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,250
她们跟我说，你每个星期要给我五十美元
They tell me you have to give me $50 a week.

141
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,750
- 没错  - 要预付
- Yeah.  - In advance.

142
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,260
不必担心，如果你认为我不…喔…
Well, don't worry. If you think I'm not...Oh...

143
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,250
不要生气，这里的人就是这样
Don't get hot under the collar. That's how people are here.

144
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,250
有人可以借我一双舞鞋吗？
Uh, can anybody lend me a pair of shoes?

145
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,260
- 我可以借你  - 喔，谢谢
- Yes. Me.  - Oh, thank you.

146
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,250
如果你想要买，我可以便宜卖给你，十五马克
If you want to buy them, I can make you a nice price. Fifteen marks.

147
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,250
谢谢，不用了，我行李里已经有一双了
Oh, no, thanks. I already have some in my suitcase.

148
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,260
我只要今天临时穿穿
I just need a pair for today.

149
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,260
但如果你不愿意…
But if you'd rather not...

150
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,250
不，没关系，拿去穿吧
No. Okay. Go ahead. Take them.

151
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,250
- 不过要记得还喔  - 当然
- But, uh, Give them back, hmm?  - Of course.

152
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,250
喔，对不起，我很抱歉
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

153
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,250
没关系，这没什么
Oh, it's okay. It doesn't matter.

154
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,250
她们都在谈论钱，会不会让你很震惊？
Did they shake you up with all that talk about money?

155
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,250
我还不习惯这样
Well, I'm not exactly used to it.

156
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,760
跟我刚来时一样
Same with me at first.

157
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,250
后来我发现这是一种迷人的习惯
Then I found out it's a charming habit around here.

158
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,760
每当我念这些名字…
I once read that names...

159
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,250
这些开头是“S”字母的…
Which begin With the letter "S"...

160
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,750
是蛇的名字
Are the names of snakes.

161
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,920
明年我毕业后
Next year, after I finish the course,

162
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,920
我将到日内瓦国家芭蕾舞学校任教
I've got an offer from the state school of ballet in Geneva.

163
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,910
那你呢？
What about you?

164
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,920
我会回美国，但我还不确定要做什么
Well, I'll go back to yhe states, but I'm not exactly sure what I'll do.

165
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,420
谢谢，我的房间很漂亮
Hey, thanks. My room is really pretty.

166
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,410
- 喜欢吗？ - 喜欢
- Like it?  - Uh-huh.

167
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,920
那让我很高兴，我们一定会相处得很好，我觉得你很可爱
That makes me happy. I bet we'll do nicely together. I think you're sweet.

168
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,920
即使我有蛇的名字？
Even if I have the name of a snake?

169
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,920
我只是开玩笑
I was just kidding.

170
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,410
不要跟我说你像莎拉一样敏感
Don't tell me you're as touchy as Sara.

171
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,920
不会
No.

172
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,910
哈罗？
Hello?

173
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,920
喔，嗨！不，不，不
Oh, hi! No, no, no.

174
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,920
你做得很对
You did the right thing.

175
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,420
- 嗨  - 嗨
- Hi.  - Hi.

176
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,660
喔，你不用把这些东西搬过来
Oh, you didn't have to bring these over here.

177
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,170
我可以明天自己去拿
I could've picked them up myself tomorrow.

178
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,670
我还以为你可能会用到
I thought you might be needing them.

179
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,670
是的，但是真的不需要这么麻烦你
Yes, but it really wasn't necessary.

180
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:33,160
- 不管怎样，多谢  - 喔，没什么
- Anyway, thanks a lot.  - Oh, no. It's nothing.

181
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,670
- 再见  - 再见
- Ciao.  - Ciao.

182
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,670
- 你不想再多待一会儿吗？ - 不，谢了，我没时间了
- Don't you want to stay for a while?  - No, thanks. I can't.

183
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:42,660
我住在学校，得在半小时内赶回去吃晚餐
I live at the school, so I've got to be back for supper in half an hour.

184
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,670
- 我必须走了  - 待一会儿也不行吗？
- I have to.  - Just for a minute?

185
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,170
不，我真的要走了
No, no, really. I have to be going.

186
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,160
如果我太晚去吃晚餐，他们会不高兴的
They get very upset if you show up late for supper.

187
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,670
- 好吧，那星期日午餐之后  - 好的，再见
- Okay, sunday. No, not before lunchtime.  - Well, ciao.

188
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:57,170
明天见
See you tomorrow.

189
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,160
再见
Bye.

190
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,160
不，继续
No, go on.

191
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,170
嗯哼，我知道
Uh-huh, I know.

192
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:09,160
你抓住他的心了，是的，是的，我听得很清楚
You caught one. Yes, yes, I can hear you very well.

193
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,160
你没看到他在害羞吗？
Didn't you see how he was blushing?

194
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,170
他很可爱，但他没有任何…嗯…
He's cute, except he doesn't have any, um...

195
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,670
他从来没有足够的钱缴学校的食宿费
And he never has enough money for room and board at school.

196
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,160
这就是为什么坦娜婊子总是要他做这做那
That's why that bitch Tanner has got him under her thumb.

197
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,660
她给他一堆事情去做
She gives him 1,001 errands to do.

198
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,670
当然
Sure.

199
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,660
我知道了，好的
I got it. Okay.

200
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,660
明天晚上打电话给我，让我考虑一下
Call me back tomorrow evening. Give me a chance to think it over.

201
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,000
是，是，好的，好的
Yes, yes. Okay, okay.

202
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,500
不管怎样，他很可爱
Anyway, he is cute.

203
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,490
可怜的佩特，她很喜欢他
Poor Pat. She liked him a lot.

204
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:42,500
那可怜的孩子，就这样死了
That poor kid, ending up like that.

205
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,000
我甚至不敢想起这件事
I can't even think about it.

206
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,490
我听说你昨晚有看到她
I heard you saw her yesterday evening.

207
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,500
嗯哼，在学校外面
Uh-huh. Outside the school.

208
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,000
她那时看起来怪怪的
She was acting very strange.

209
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,000
还在喃喃自语
Mumbling to herself.

210
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,660
她被开除时真的感觉很糟，不过这也是她活该
She really felt terrible when they kicked her out, but she really deserved it.

211
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,670
- 那里有很多喧闹声  - 天啊，她很难过
- There was so much noise.  - God, was she difficult.

212
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:08,160
她说着一些没意义的话
She was saying things that made no sense.

213
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,660
她老是和人争吵、惹麻烦
She was always arguing, causing trouble.

214
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,920
“秘密”
"Secret."

215
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,660
“鸢尾花”
"Iris."

216
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,160
什么？
What?

217
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,670
嗯，我记得…
Uh, I remember...

218
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,660
她提到了“秘密”这个字
She mentioned the word "secret."

219
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,660
然后她…提到了一种花…
And then she...Mentioned a flower...

220
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,660
鸢尾花，我想想，或是丁香花？
Iris, I think, or a lilac.

221
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,170
秘密、花？那是什么意思呢？
Secret flowers? What's that supposed to mean?

222
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:37,160
我不知道，她是个爱管闲事的人
I don't know. She was a busybody.

223
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:41,160
她可以轻易从拥挤的人群中找出我们其中一个
It would've been easy for her to find out one of us was in a jam.

224
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,070
- 你觉得欧嘉的家怎么样？ - 很好
- How do you like it at Olga's?  - It's nice.

225
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:18,080
今早在名单上的八个人跟我到黄色房间来
Those eight on the list this morning, come with me to the yellow room.

226
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,070
- 早安，坦娜小姐  - 苏西
- Good morning, miss Tanner.  - Suzy.

227
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:27,080
- 早安，布兰克夫人  - 我有好消息要告诉你
- Good morning, madame Blanc.  - I've got good news for you.

228
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,080
- 你的房间已经准备好了  - 喔
- We have it all arranged. Your room is ready for you.  - Huh

229
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,070
这不是很好吗？如果你想要，你今天就可以搬进来
Isn't that marvelous? You can move in today, if you like.

230
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,570
不过如果可以，我想住在欧嘉那里
But I'd rather stay at Olga's, if it's okay.

231
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,080
对我来说没关系，亲爱的
Doesn't matter to me, my dear,

232
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,080
但是在你的入学信函中，你说要住在学校里
But in your letter of enrollment, you said you'd be boarding at the school.

233
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,070
- 我知道，不过…  - 房间现在空出来了
- I know, but...  - The room is free now.

234
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,580
- 我不认为这有那么重要  - 如你所愿吧
- Well, I didn't think it was so important.  - As you wish.

235
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,080
如果你想住在那里，就去住吧
If that's what you want, so be it.

236
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,570
莎拉
Sara?

237
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,570
我不知道你这么固执
I had no idea you were so strong-willed.

238
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,570
我觉得你在做某些决定时太固执了
I see that when you make up your mind about something,

239
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:16,070
好像没有任何事会改变你
Nothing will change it for you.

240
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,080
我向你致意
My compliments.

241
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,570
女巫！
Witch!

242
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,900
然后在接近十九世纪末的时候
And then, toward the end of the 19th century,

243
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,910
传统芭蕾舞的技巧…
The technique of classical ballet...

244
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:08,400
采取一种不一样、更有风格性的表现形式
Assumed a different, more stylized impostation.

245
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,400
好吧，让我们热热身
All right. Let's warm up.

246
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,410
怎么了？你不舒服吗？
What's wrong? Don't you feel well?

247
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:18,900
不，没什么，我只是觉得有一点虚弱
No, it's nothing. I just feel a little weak.

248
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,400
如果情况更糟，我会停止的
If it gets any worse, I'll just stop.

249
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,410
现在来做一些练习
And now some exercises.

250
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,400
丹尼尔，你可以开始了
Daniel, you may begin.

251
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:35,560
一、二、三、四
One, two, three and four.

252
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,070
一、二…
And one and two...

253
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,570
三、四…
And three and four.

254
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,150
一、二…
And one and two...

255
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,160
三、四…
And three and four.

256
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,150
- 一…  - 抱歉，坦娜小姐
- And one...  - I'm sorry, miss Tanner.

257
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,650
我觉得有一点虚弱，我可以休息一下吗？
I feel a little weak. Can I just rest for a second?

258
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,900
虚弱？拜托，这是很简单的舞步
Weak? Come on. It's an easy step.

259
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,400
这是我们第一次一起练习
This is the first time we've worked together.

260
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,400
我想看看你的能力如何
I want to see what you can do, how far along you are.

261
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,400
现在来和其他同学一起，来吧，我们开始
Now, come along and join the others. Come on; let's go.

262
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,150
丹尼尔
Daniel?

263
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:08,150
现在大家一起
All together now.

264
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,140
一、二…
And one and two...

265
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:16,150
三、四…
And three and four.

266
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:20,650
- 我不行了，拜托  - 一、二…
- I can't. Please.  - And one and two...

267
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,640
三、四
And three and four.

268
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:28,150
一、二、三、四
And one and two and three and four.

269
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,390
一、二、三、四
And one and two and three and four.

270
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,650
专心点，苏西，把腿抬高一点，你没有瘫痪
Pay attention, Suzy. Get those legs up higher. You're not paralyzed.

271
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:43,060
把腿抬高一点，一、二、三…
Get those legs up higher. And one and two and three and...

272
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,150
专心点，苏西，一、二…
Pay attention, Suzy. And one and two...

273
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,650
三、四
And three and four.

274
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:52,640
一、二、三、四
And one and two and three and four.

275
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,810
快走开
Come on. Come on. Run along.

276
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:28,320
来，喝下去
Come on. Drink up.

277
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,310
- 喔，你…你必须要喝  - 不，够了
- Oh, you...You must drink.  - No, that's enough.

278
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,810
听医生的话
You heard what the doctor said.

279
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:36,310
- 喝下去  - 不
- Drink up.  - No.

280
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,320
你必须要喝
You must drink.

281
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,390
你出血要吸收液体补充回来
The blood that was hemorrhaging is going back with the intake of liquids.

282
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:45,400
- 对吧，维迪葛斯教授？ - 没错
- Right, professor Verdegast?  - Obviously.

283
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,900
我亲爱的夫人
My dear madame.

284
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,890
不用担心，没事了，我已经跟年轻的小姐说了
Do not be concerned. It's nothing, as I've already told the young lady.

285
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:54,900
那我可以放心了，教授，你现在觉得如何呢，亲爱的？
That's a relief, professor. How do you feel, dear?

286
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,900
- 嗯，好多了  - 这个毛病是出在你的练习上
- Uh, better.  - The fault lies with your exercises.

287
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:03,400
当人久未锻炼时，剧烈运动会使韧带轻微的撕裂
When somebody's been out of practice, violent movement could cause tiny tears in internal ligaments.

288
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,400
这就是导致流血的原因
Thus the hemorrhaging.

289
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,390
你看起来好一点了，你的脸颊已经恢复一点血色了
You look better already. You've even got color back in your cheeks.

290
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,390
- 没错吧？ - 没错，她看起来好多了
- Isn't that right?  - Oh, yes. She looks much better.

291
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,400
- 喔！ - 别动
- Ow!  - Hold still.

292
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,900
这能很快恢复你的健康
This will get you back into shape in no time.

293
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,890
好了，一两天之后你就会恢复得像新的一样
Here we are. Fine, fine. A day or two, you'll be on your feet, as good as new.

294
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,890
- 谁把我的行李拿过来的？ - 欧嘉，她多么体贴啊
- Who brought my bags here?  - Olga. What a dear.

295
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,890
当她听到你病了，她就马上回家帮你把行李拿过来
The minute she heard you were ill, she went right home and brought your things.

296
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,900
喔，她还把你的五十元原封不动的交给我
Oh, and she also left me your $50, and she didn't take a penny of it.

297
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,890
为什么…为什么她要这样做？
Why...Why did she do that?

298
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:42,890
- 如果我想要，我会…  - 好了，亲爱的
- If I wanted to, I would...  - Well, my dear,

299
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:45,900
你现在需要的是安静
What you need now is some peace and quiet.

300
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,390
如果再流血，这未必会发生
If the hemorrhaging should start again, which is very improbable,

301
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,890
你可以打电话给我
You can telephone me.

302
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:55,400
坦娜，她这个星期都要吃没刺激性的食物
And Tanner, she is to eat bland food for about a week.

303
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,890
而且不能让她吃任何水果
And you mustn't let her have any fruit.

304
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,390
- 一小杯的玫瑰红酒呢？ - 可以
- A drop of vin rose?  - Yes.

305
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:03,900
好的，每餐一杯红酒对恢复很有好处
Good. A glass of red wine with each meal. It works miracles.

306
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,390
这能够帮助血液制造红血球，减少贫血的发生
Clears up anemia and strengthens red corpuscles. It builds the blood.

307
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,390
好好休息，你会被好好照顾的
Rest well. You're in good hands.

308
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:38,640
苏西，我们是隔壁邻居
Suzy, we're next-door neighbors.

309
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,640
那么，你搬来这里了
So, you moved in here.

310
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,640
是她们把我搬来这里的
Well, they moved me in here.

311
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,640
其实我并不想
I really didn't want to.

312
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,140
你知道的，当我病倒后，欧嘉就跑回去把我的行李拿来…
You know, as soon as I got sick, your pal Olga ran and got my bags...

313
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,140
然后把我赶出她的家
And threw me out of her place.

314
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,640
她一定认为我得了什么可怕的传染病
She must've thought I had something awfully contagious.

315
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,640
但我无法忍受像十岁小孩一样住在寄宿学校
But I can't stand to live in a boarding school like a ten-year-old.

316
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,650
喔，看起来你恢复体力了
Oh, wow. You come back strong.

317
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,140
对，我真的感觉好多了
Yeah, you know, I feel really well.

318
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,640
我是说，就好像没有发生过事情一样，这太不可思议了
I mean, it's almost as if nothing had happened. It's incredible.

319
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,150
- 这都要感谢维迪葛斯教授  - 维迪葛斯？
- And all thanks to professor Verdegast.  - Verdegast?

320
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,140
- 他来看你？ - 对
- He came to look at you?  - Yeah.

321
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,640
请进
Come in.

322
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,140
嗨，帕罗斯
Hi, Pavlos.

323
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,050
谢谢你
Thank you.

324
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,060
你最好留意那个打火机，他很喜欢它
You'd better keep an eye on that lighter. He really likes it.

325
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,050
好的，不过我不觉得他是小偷
Yes, but I don't think he's a thief.

326
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,050
至少你知道
At least you know.

327
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:48,060
- 你要在这里吃饭吗？ - 对，她们限制我的饮食
- Are you eating up here?  - Yeah, they put me on a restricted diet.

328
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,060
限制饮食还有酒？
And on a restricted diet, they give you wine?

329
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:55,050
这是维迪葛斯教授的主意，他说这可以帮助我的血液
That's professor Verdegast's idea. Says it'll build up my blood.

330
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:04,390
铃声，天啊，这表示在吃晚餐之前只剩下十五分钟
The bell. Oh, god. That means it's only 15 minutes till supper.

331
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,890
我最好去换衣服
I'd better change.

332
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,890
- 待会见  - 好的
- Ciao. See you later.  - Okay.

333
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,380
在哪里？在哪里？
Where? Where?

334
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,390
到处都有，整层楼
Everywhere. The whole floor.

335
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:47,390
真恶心！真让人恶心！
It's disgusting! It's disgusting!

336
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,880
- 它们从哪里来的？ - 我不知道！我们去看看吧！
- Where are they coming from?  - I don't know! Let's go and see!

337
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,390
- 它们从天花板来的  - 在还没解决之前，所有人都下楼
- They're coming from the ceiling.  - In the meantime, everybody downstairs.

338
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,550
不要让任何人上来
Don't let anyone come up.

339
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:08,050
我很抱歉，真是羞愧，请原谅我
I'm sorry. Truly mortified. Please excuse me.

340
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,050
不过这跟你并没有关系，夫人
But it was nothing to do with you, madame.

341
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:13,050
当然没有，女孩们，这不是布兰克夫人的错
No, of course not, girls. It was not madame Blanc's fault.

342
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,790
我们透过邮件
We ordered those cases of food by mail...

343
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,300
向我们认为诚实可靠的公司订购食物
From a reliable firm that we thought to be honest.

344
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,220
很显然，它们运到时已经腐烂了
Obviously, It arrived spoiled.

345
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,720
几天之内，就发生了这些事
In a few days' time, you see what happened.

346
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,460
- 喔，这真是可怕  - 对啊，有一只还掉进我的嘴巴
- Oh, it was awful.  - Yes, one got in my mouth.

347
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:29,470
我想我们还是幸运的，那些虫子只到了顶楼的下一层
I suppose we're fortunate those things only reached the floor below the attic.

348
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:32,470
- 那其他楼层没有问题吗？ - 对，我们检查过了
- Are the other floors all right?  - Yes. We checked them out.

349
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,460
只有学生寝室的楼层
Just the floor where the students' rooms are.

350
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,460
好吧，我早上会处理消毒的问题
Well, I'll take care of the problem of fumigating in the morning.

351
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,970
问题还没解决之前，今晚我先做一个临时的安排
In the meantime, for tonight, I've thought of a makeshift arrangement.

352
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:43,460
亲爱的，你可以去看看他们进展如何吗？
Go and see how they're getting along, will you, dear?

353
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,460
男孩们都很体贴的提供协助
The boys have kindly offered to help,

354
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,970
他们和仆人们把练习厅布置成一个大寝室
And they and the servants are turning the practice hall into a dormitory.

355
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:53,960
如果你们有人选择要外出住宿，我没有任何反对
If some of you choose to find hotel rooms, I'll have no objections.

356
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,960
但是现在已经很晚了，无论如何…
But it's already late, and in any case,

357
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,960
这种不便只有一个晚上而已
The inconvenience will only be for one night.

358
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,300
我们全部都一起睡
We'll all sleep together.

359
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,790
好极了！你还好吗？
Bravo. You all right?

360
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:06,300
- 是的，谢谢你  - 很好
- Yes, thank you.  - Fine.

361
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
- 一切都还好吗？ - 是的，谢谢你
- Is everything all right?  - Yes, thank you.

362
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,800
- 很好  - 你还好吗？
- Good.  - Are you all right?

363
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,790
是的，布兰克夫人，谢谢你
Yes, madame Blanc. Thank you.

364
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,790
- 喔，这样很舒服，就像露营一样  - 很好
- Oh, it's very comfortable. Just like being in camp.  - Good.

365
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,300
你也要跟我们一起睡在这里吗，布兰克夫人？
Are you sleeping here with us, too, Madame Blanc?

366
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,790
当然，就跟坦娜小姐和其他老师一样
Certainly, as are all the other teachers and miss Tanner.

367
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,790
其他老师也住在学校吗？
Do the teachers live here at school?

368
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,790
没有，他们住在城里
No, they live in town.

369
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:29,300
她们都在晚餐后九点半离开，就像钟表一样
They leave after supper at 9:30, just like clockwork.

370
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,460
现在很晚了，我关掉电灯，你们不会害怕吧？
It's very late. You won't be afraid if I turn out the lights?

371
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,460
- 各位晚安  - 晚安
- Good night, everyone.  - Good night. Good night.

372
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,130
那家伙喜欢你吗？
Is that guy hot for you?

373
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,090
- 也许  - 这真有趣
- Maybe.  - That's funny.

374
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:21,000
我听过他是…嗯…
I heard he was, uh...

375
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,550
- 当然，我不太喜欢说别人闲话  - 那是个好习惯
- Of course, I'm not much of a gossip.  - That's a good one.

376
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:29,120
算了吧，你想追他却没有成功
Come on. You tried to get him and didn't make it.

377
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,080
- 你说谎！那不是…  - 为什么你们两个不闭嘴？
- You liar! That's not...  - Why don't you two shut up?

378
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,630
我们有些人想要睡觉
Some of us want to go to sleep.

379
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:42,120
嘿，莎拉，忘了它吧，这没关系
Hey, Sara. Forget it. It's okay.

380
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,450
苏西，你睡着了吗？
Suzy, are you asleep?

381
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:08,200
- 你睡着了吗？ - 还没，有什么事吗？
- Were you sleeping?  - No. What's the matter?

382
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,330
你听到那鼾声吗？
You hear that snoring?

383
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:15,200
听起来怪怪的
It's weird.

384
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,080
听到了吗？
Hear it?

385
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,460
你想这声音是从哪里传来的？
Where do you think it's coming from?

386
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:30,120
在帘子后面
Behind the sheet.

387
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,630
说谎！
Lies!

388
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,700
什么？
What?

389
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,210
她们对我们说谎
They lied to us.

390
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,710
校长在这里
The directress is here.

391
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:46,200
那个打鼾的人是她
That's her, the one who's snoring.

392
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,700
她是校长
She's the directress.

393
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,170
- 你怎么知道？ - 我确定是她
- How do you know?  - I'm sure it's her.

394
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,490
去年的一段时间
Last year, for a while,

395
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,620
我住在客房的其中一间
I lived in one of the guest rooms...

396
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,790
在顶楼的下面
Under the top of the stairs.

397
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,290
有一天晚上
One night,

398
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:10,040
我听到有人很晚进来
I heard someone coming very late in,

399
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,200
躺到我隔壁房间的床上
Getting into bed in the room next to mine.

400
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,370
然后…
And then...

401
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:19,960
然后我听到这种古怪的打鼾声
Then I heard this weird kind of snoring.

402
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,530
我告诉你，那真的很古怪，我永远都无法忘记
I tell you, it was so weird I never forgot it.

403
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,540
注意听
Listen.

404
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,110
你听到那声音了吗？
You hear that whistle?

405
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,280
确实一模一样
It's exactly the same.

406
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:39,290
隔天早上，布兰克夫人跟我说…
The next morning, madame Blanc told me...

407
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,780
校长在学校忙到很晚…
That the directress had spent a few hours at the school...

408
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:44,780
然后睡在我隔壁房里
And had slept in the room next to mine.

409
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:48,950
你明白吗？
You see?

410
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:53,030
所以我知道她是校长
So I know she's the directress.

411
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:55,030
她在这里
She's here.

412
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,200
她在那里
She's there.

413
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,280
就在帘子后面
Right behind that sheet.

414
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:28,530
我很感激你们能这么快的消毒好
Thank you. I'm grateful you can take care of the fumigating so promptly.

415
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:31,530
- 早安，布兰克夫人  - 早安，丹尼尔
- Good morning, madame Blanc.  - Good morning, Daniel.

416
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:35,030
- 现在一切都就序了吗？ - 都清理好了，夫人
- Is everything in order now?  - All cleaned up, madame.

417
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:37,540
为了确定，我们还检查了其他楼层
Just to be sure, we checked the other floors too.

418
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:43,530
坦娜小姐，抱歉
Miss Tanner. Excuse me.

419
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:45,530
校长昨晚有睡在这里吗？
Did the directress sleep here last night?

420
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:48,530
- 她没有，早安，丹尼尔  - 早安
- No, she didn't. Good morning, Daniel.  - Good morning.

421
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:53,030
你知道她正在外面旅行，也许两个星期后她会回来看我们
You know she's away on a trip. Maybe she'll pay us a visit two weeks from now.

422
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:56,540
抱歉，坦娜小姐，我今天早上要上什么课？
Excuse me, miss Tanner, But which class do I attend this morning?

423
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,530
在红色房间的二年级班
The second-year class in the red room.

424
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:00,530
谢谢你
Thank you.

425
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,780
停止！
Stop!

426
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,770
停止！停止！
Stop! Stop!

427
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,780
够了！已经够了！
Enough. Enough!

428
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:10,780
- 你知道发生什么事吗？你知道吗？ - 今天是什么日子？
- Do you know what happened? Do you know?  - What day is it?

429
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:14,280
你那只满是跳蚤、恶心的狗，竟敢咬艾伯特！
Your lousy, disgusting dog has bitten Albert!

430
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,280
它咬掉了一片艾伯特手臂上的肉
He took a piece out of Albert's arm.

431
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:19,280
- 什么？ - 你们都听到了吗？
- What?  - Did you all hear that?

432
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,280
那只卑鄙的狗想要让孩子残废
That miserable dog tried to mutilate a child.

433
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:26,280
布兰克夫人必须紧急送艾伯特到第一诊疗中心缝伤口！
Madame Blanc had to rush Albert to a first-aid center to have stitches put in!

434
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,780
- 那是不可能的  - 那我们一起去第一诊疗中心
- That's impossible.  - Let's go to the first-aid center.

435
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,280
就算你看不到血，至少也能听到那个可怜孩子的哭声吧！
Even if you can't see the blood, at least you can hear the poor child's crying.

436
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,270
够了！
That's enough now!

437
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:39,280
我的狗很忠诚又乖巧，它从来没有伤害过任何人
My dog's a peaceful, faithful animal. He's never hurt anyone.

438
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,780
那个孩子一定有先招惹它！
The boy must have done something to him first!

439
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:45,270
喔，那可怜的小东西！可怜的小狗！
Oh, the poor little animal! The poor little puppy!

440
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:49,780
假如我再看到它接近这个学校，我就要它死！
If I ever see him within a mile of this school again, I'll have him put to death!

441
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,780
住口！
Stop it!

442
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,770
我不允许你这样说，你听清楚了吗？
I won't allow such talk, you understand?

443
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:56,780
你不允许吗？
You won't allow it?

444
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,280
那么你和你的狗滚出去！
Then get out! You and your dog!

445
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:02,770
- 走吧！ - 你这个婊子！
- Get moving!  - You bitch!

446
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,770
出去！
Out!

447
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:07,780
我正要出去，我正要出去
I'm going. I'm going.

448
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:10,280
不过你要明白…
But try to understand that...

449
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:14,270
我是瞎子，不是聋子
That I'm blind, not deaf.

450
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:16,780
你明白吗？
Get it? Huh?

451
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,780
不是聋子
Not deaf.

452
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:21,530
我不是聋子，你明白了吗？
Not deaf. You understand that?

453
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:23,520
你明白了吗？
You understand?

454
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:29,030
啊，新鲜的空气！
Ahh, fresh air!

455
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:31,520
让我离开这个虚伪的行列吧！
Let me out of this gilded parade.

456
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:36,030
出去！滚出去！滚得好！
Get out! Get out of here! Good riddance!

457
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:43,520
喔，帕罗斯，我还要吃这种东西多久？
Oh, Pavlos, how much longer do I have to eat like this?

458
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:10,100
嘿，注意听
Hey, listen.

459
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:14,110
她们准时走了
There they go, right on schedule.

460
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:16,610
那些老师，记得吗？
The teachers. Remember?

461
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:21,600
你能听到吗？她们正要离开
Can you hear them? They're going away.

462
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,610
你听得到吗？
You hear them?

463
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,600
是的
Yes.

464
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,270
我…
I...

465
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,770
我…我不认为她们会想念学校
I...I don't think they'll even miss school.

466
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:54,770
什么？你说什么？
What? What did you say?

467
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:57,280
醒醒
Wake up.

468
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,770
我说，对我来说，她们似乎没有出去
I said, it doesn't seem to me that they're going out.

469
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:05,780
前门在左边
A front door is on the left.

470
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,770
她们的脚步声往右边走，在学校里的某处
Their footsteps are going to the right, somewhere inside the school.

471
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:15,270
天啊，苏西
Jesus, Suzy.

472
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:16,280
- 你真是天才  - 嗯…
- You're a genius.  - Mmm.

473
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,770
好极了
Fantastic.

474
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:23,190
为什么我以前从未注意到呢？
How come I never noticed that before?

475
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:28,180
苏西，如果她们没有离开，她们会去哪里呢？
Suzy. If they don't leave, Where do they go?

476
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,690
醒醒，苏西
Wake up. Suzy.

477
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:35,530
快醒醒，苏西！
Come on. Wake up. Suzy!

478
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,520
我好想睡觉
I'm so sleepy.

479
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,520
我不知道为什么，对不起
I don't know why. I'm sorry.

480
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,520
也许…
Maybe...

481
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,020
也许我们能找到她们真正去的地方
Maybe we can find out where they really go.

482
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:53,020
当然！对了
Of course! Yes.

483
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,520
开始数她们走的脚步声
Begin to count the steps as they go.

484
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:18,770
这就像寻找线索一样
It's like the search of alietne.

485
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:46,920
放轻松
Easy.

486
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:50,430
怎么了？
What is it? Huh?

487
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:52,430
走吧
Come on.

488
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:55,920
快点，我们走吧
Come on; let's go home.

489
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,180
是谁？谁在那里？
Who is that? Who's there?

490
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,840
放轻松，孩子
Easy, boy.

491
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,350
怎么了？
What is it?

492
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,920
发生了什么事？
What's happening?

493
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:44,050
谁在那里？
Who's there?

494
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:51,010
谁在那里？
Who's there?

495
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:07,170
等等！
Wait!

496
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:06,420
可怜的丹尼尔，被撕成了碎片，真令人不敢相信
Poor Daniel. Torn to pieces. Incredible.

497
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:09,420
没错，但你不能太信任狼犬
Oh, yeah, but you can never put too much trust in wolfhounds.

498
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:12,920
它们很疯狂，我们以前在格施塔德的别墅养过两只
They're crazy. We had two of them once at the villa in Gestaad.

499
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,920
我的天啊，最先是佩特被疯子杀了
My god. First Pat gets murdered by a madman,

500
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,420
而现在丹尼尔又被他的狗咬死了
And now Daniel is killed by his dog.

501
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,920
对啊，也许这地方有不祥的东西
Yeah. Maybe there's a hex on the place.

502
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:25,420
对，那我们请神父来驱魔好了
Yeah. Let's call in the exorcist and have it purged.

503
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,920
- 怎么了？有什么问题吗？ - 没有，一切都很好
- What is it? Is something wrong?  - No, everything's all right.

504
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:32,670
是私人的问题吗，亲爱的？
Is it something personal, dear?

505
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:35,170
不是，不是那样
No, no, it's nothing like that.

506
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:39,170
坦娜小姐，你介意吗？
Miss Tanner, would you mind?

507
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:41,330
我想独自和苏西谈几分钟
I'd like a few minutes alone with Suzy.

508
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,830
怎么回事？
Well? What is it?

509
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:52,840
我只是想跟你谈谈最近发生的一些事情
I just wanted to talk to you about some of the things that have been happening lately.

510
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:56,330
喔，我知道你对丹尼尔的死感到不安，我们大家都是
Oh, I know you're upset by Daniel's death, as we all have been.

511
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:58,330
不，不只是那样
No, but it's more than that.

512
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:01,330
有人知道谁杀了佩特吗？
Does anybody know anything about who killed Pat?

513
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,340
我今天早上跟警察局长谈过话
I spoke with the chief of police just this morning.

514
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,830
他告诉我，他们有一些明确的线索
He told me they had some definite clues.

515
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:09,330
- 你知道我来的那晚有看到她  - 是的，你告诉过我
- You know that I saw her the night I arrived here.  - Yes, you told me that.

516
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:12,790
那时她含糊地说一些奇怪无关的话
And that she was mumbling some strange, unrelated words.

517
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,790
你没有告诉过我
No, you didn't tell me that.

518
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:19,330
因为这没办法合理解释，那是在暴风雨中
Because it was something that didn't make any sense. It was in a thunderstorm.

519
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:22,340
我没有注意去听清楚
I just didn't pay much attention to it.

520
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:25,330
我只能清楚地听到两个字…
I only caught two words distinctly:

521
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:27,790
“秘密”和“鸢尾花”
"Secret" and "Irises."

522
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:31,330
我不知道这些是什么意思，但我认为也许很重要
I don't know what they mean, but I thought they might be important.

523
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:33,340
你做得很好
You've done very well. Congratulations.

524
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:36,330
我也不知道“秘密”或“鸢尾花”是什么意思
I don't know what the words "Secret" or "Irises" mean either.

525
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:38,790
但我想应该要让警察知道这件事
But I think it's only right we should let the police know about it.

526
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:43,300
我只是很惊讶你等了两天才说“哈罗”？
I'm only amazed you waited two days before... hello?

527
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:47,080
- 你真的把事情弄糟了  - 你在说什么？
- You really messed things up.  - What are you talking about?

528
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:50,080
因为…也许佩特在跟那天晚上
Because... Maybe Pat was talking to...

529
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:53,090
这栋房子里的某个人说话
Someone just inside the building that night.

530
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,580
我们知道那个人不是我们学校的老师
And we know that someone wasn't one of the teachers.

531
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:08,330
来吧
Come on.

532
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:13,330
现在你使某人落到他们调查范围内了
Now you've put them on the hunt for somebody.

533
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:16,330
这对你来说有什么差别？
What difference does that make to you?

534
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:18,330
很大的差别
Big difference.

535
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:22,330
因为我是佩特的朋友
Because I was Pat's friend.

536
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,330
你突然来到的时候，她正告诉我一些事情
She was telling me something When you suddenly showed up.

537
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:28,830
她被吓坏了，然后跑了
She got scared and she ran away.

538
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:31,330
那时她几乎陷入歇斯底里
She was in hysterics almost.

539
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,830
然后她就被杀死了
And then she was killed.

540
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:37,330
记得当你按门铃时的那个声音吗？
Remember that voice when you rang the bell?

541
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:39,830
跟你说话的就是我
Well, that was me.

542
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:39,820
我听到一些奇怪、难以置信和荒谬的事情
I heard strange, incredible, absurd things.

543
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:42,330
佩特写在笔记上好几个月了
Pat was taking notes on them for months.

544
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:45,830
在她走之前，她把笔记都给了我
And before going away, she gave me all the notes.

545
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:49,320
我只有跟一个我非常要好的朋友说过
I've only told one person, a very good friend of mine.

546
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:52,330
法兰克曼德尔，他是来这里参加一个会议
Frank Mandel. He's here for a convention.

547
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:55,830
今晚我会让你读这些笔记
I'll let you read them tonight.

548
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:10,490
苏西，醒醒，拜托，醒醒
Suzy, wake up. Please. Wake up.

549
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:13,950
笔记不见了！有人从我那里偷走了！
The notes are gone! Someone stole them from me!

550
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:17,750
你明白吗？笔记不见了
You understand? They disappeared.

551
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:22,580
不要睡着！请帮帮我！
Don't fall asleep! Please help me!

552
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:25,830
- 醒醒！帮帮我！ - 我不能
- Wake up! Help me!  - I can't.

553
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,580
不能？
Can't?

554
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:35,080
这是我唯一剩下的东西，因为我放在身边，看
This is the only thing I got left, and that's because I kept it on me. Look.

555
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,570
- 看  - 这是什么？
- Look.  - What is it?

556
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:42,080
你到底怎么了？你不记得吗？发生什么事？
What's the matter with you? Don't you remember? What's going on?

557
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:46,330
这是让我们知道老师每晚去哪里的关键
This is the key that'll get us wherever the teachers go every night.

558
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:50,320
昨晚我坐在你旁边时想出来的办法
I thought it out yesterday evening while I was sitting here next to you.

559
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:56,040
苏西，你知道女巫吗？
Suzy, do you know anything about witches?

560
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:04,580
喔，不！拜托！
Oh, no! Please!

561
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:09,570
不要留下我一个人！
Don't leave me alone!

562
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:24,540
我一定要逃走！
I must get away!

563
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:24,190
等等！
Wait!

564
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,400
等等！
Wait!

565
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:22,320
等等！等等！等等！等等！
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

566
01:09:14,890 --> 01:09:17,760
在找莎拉吗？她不见了
Looking for Sara? She's disappeared.

567
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:20,760
但这是不可能的，我昨晚还跟她说过话
But that's impossible. I just talked to her last night.

568
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:24,770
她今天早上离开了，事实上，没有告诉任何人
She left this morning, as a matter of fact, without telling anyone.

569
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:28,260
只是拿起她的行李就走了，她被听到在大约六点钟时离开
Just packed her bags and left. She was heard leaving about 6:00.

570
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:31,760
- 你有听到她离开，不是吗？ - 莎拉？喔，是的
- You heard her leave, didn't you?  - Sara? Oh, yes.

571
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:35,270
我听到大门被关上和她的脚步声离开了大厅
I heard the door close and her footsteps going down the hall.

572
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:39,260
然后我听到汽车驶离街道的声音，我猜有人在等她吧
And then I heard a car driving off down the street. I guess someone was waiting for her.

573
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:44,270
- 但这是不可能的  - 如果她不高兴在这里，她可以告诉别人
- But it's impossible.  - If she wasn't happy here, she could've told someone.

574
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:47,260
为什么要像小偷一样偷偷溜走？
Why sneak off like a thief?

575
01:09:57,510 --> 01:10:01,510
你好，我可以跟法兰克曼德尔说话吗？好的，谢谢你
Hello. May I speak to Frank Mandel, please? Yes, thank you.

576
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:06,010
你好，我是苏西邦妮
Hello. This is Suzy Bannion.

577
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:09,010
不，我们没有见过面，我是莎拉的朋友
No, we've never met. I'm a friend of Sara's.

578
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:13,520
是的，你好，你知道莎拉在哪里吗？
Yes. Hello. Do you happen to know where Sara is?

579
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:18,010
她今天早上从学校失踪了
Well, she disappeared from school this morning.

580
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:21,510
是的，似乎她带着所有行李离开了
Yes, it seems she left and took all her luggage.

581
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:26,010
是的，嗯，听着，我今天可以跟你见个面吗？
Yes. Uh, listen, could I see you sometime today?

582
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:30,010
嗯，我真的很担心她
Well, I'm really worried about her.

583
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:34,510
喔，好极了，在哪里呢？
Oh, great. Where?

584
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:38,010
在会议中心，好的，我会去那里见你
At the convention center. Okay. I'll see you there.

585
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:41,510
她没有告知任何同学，我已经问过所有人
She didn't inform any of her classmates. I've already asked all of them.

586
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:45,010
真烦人，我不明白她为什么要这样做
It's very upsetting. I can't understand why she did it.

587
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:48,010
我是受他们家庭请托的监护人
I'm the one who's held responsible by their families.

588
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:51,640
我会打电话给她在日内瓦的父亲，或许她已经到那里了
I'll call her father in Geneva. Perhaps she might have gone there.

589
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:08,640
我已经打电话给莎拉的父亲，他是意大利驻日内瓦的领事
I've already phoned Sara's father. He's the Italian consul in Geneva.

590
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:13,130
但他今天不在那里，去度周末了
But he wasn't there today. He was away for the weekend.

591
01:11:13,130 --> 01:11:17,130
他们说他星期一会回来，而且他们不知道关于她的任何事情
They said he'd be back by monday, and they don't know anything about her there.

592
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:20,140
你知道我为什么这么担心吗？
Well, do you understand Why I'm so worried?

593
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:24,630
我知道，但我们也只能等她父亲回来了
Yes, but before we both get upset, let's wait for the father's return.

594
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:28,140
也许他们今天早上会合一起离开的
Maybe they got together this morning and went off on their own.

595
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:34,130
我非常了解她，她是我三年前的病人
I know her quite well. She was a patient of mine three years ago.

596
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:38,140
- 你知道了吗？ - 我甚至不知道你是精神科医师
- Were you aware of that?  - No. I didn't even know you were a psychiatrist.

597
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:42,630
她曾经在她母亲过世时精神崩溃过
Well, she had a nervous breakdown after her mother's death,

598
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:45,130
所以她来接受我的治疗
And she came to me for treatment.

599
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:49,140
在她病情好转之后，我们仍然是朋友
After she got better again, we remained friends,

600
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:54,130
但最近她因为一个朋友向她灌输一些思想而感到不安
But lately she was upset about some notions put into her head by a friend of hers.

601
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:57,130
- 我希望那个人不是你？ - 不是
- Not you, I hope?  - No.

602
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:59,880
那是一些疯狂的想法
They were kind of wild ideas.

603
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:04,380
她发现塔姆学院是于…
She had discovered that the Tam academy was founded...

604
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:09,010
一八九五年由一位希腊移民海莲娜玛蔻斯建立的
In 1895 by a certain Helena Markos, A Greek immigrant,

605
01:12:09,010 --> 01:12:12,510
而当地人认为她是一个女巫
And that the local people believed her to be a witch.

606
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:18,010
- 我猜你知道这件事了？ - 不，但我有一种奇怪的感觉…
- I guess you knew that?  - No. But I have a strange feeling...

607
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:23,510
好像有人已经跟我说过这件事，或是类似的事
That somebody already told me about it...Or something similar.

608
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:25,510
我不记得了
I can't...can't remember.

609
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:29,500
那真的让莎拉发挥想像力在十九世纪初期…
Well, that really got Sara's imagination going. Earlier in the 19th century,

610
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:34,380
玛蔻斯女士被数个欧洲国家驱逐出境
The Markos woman had been expelled from several european countries.

611
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:39,880
她似乎做过一些事，才使得教徒迫害她
She seemed to have something about her which urged religious people to persecute her.

612
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:44,880
她也写过一些书，我读过其中一本
She also wrote a number of books, and I read that among the initiated,

613
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:48,500
书名叫做“黑暗女王”
She went by the name "The Black Queen."

614
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:52,510
在她定居于这里之后，她变成很多街头流言的主角
After she settled down here, she became the subject of a lot of gossip.

615
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:56,510
虽然如此，她还是设法得到一大笔钱
Nevertheless, she managed to put her hands on a great deal of money,

616
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:59,000
然后她建立了塔姆学院
And she founded the Tam academy...

617
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:04,130
起先是教导舞蹈和神秘学的学校
At first a sort of school of dance and occult sciences.

618
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:07,120
但是没有维持很久，因为在一九〇五年
But that didn't last long, because in 1905,

619
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:10,130
在她年满一百岁、也是被诅咒的第十年
After being hounded and cursed at for ten years,

620
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:13,630
玛蔻斯夫人死于一场大火
Madame Markos died in a fire.

621
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:17,120
那个事件和巫术一样被人们所关注
That's all there is, as far as witchcraft is concerned.

622
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:22,260
于是学校被她最喜爱的学生接管，神秘学的课程也被完全废除
The school was taken over by her favorite pupil. The study of the occult was abandoned.

623
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:26,750
不久后这个地方变成一所着名的舞蹈学院
And soon the place became the famous dance academy.

624
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:31,750
但这跟当一个女巫有什么关系？
But what does it mean to be a witch?

625
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,380
从一个唯物论者和精神科医师的角度来说
Well, as a believer in the material world and a psychiatrist to boot,

626
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:39,880
我相信现今对魔法和神秘学的信仰的传播…
I'm convinced that the current spread of belief in magic and the occult...

627
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:43,380
是精神病的一部分
Is part of mental illness.

628
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:48,880
坏运气不是摔破一面镜子带来的，而是由坏心情带来的
Bad luck isn't brought by broken mirrors, but by broken minds.

629
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:52,840
抱歉，米辽斯
Excuse me. Milius?

630
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,410
米辽斯教授可以比我更清楚回答你的问题
Professor Milius can answer your question better than I can.

631
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,920
他写过一本叫做“妄想狂或魔法”的书，相信我
He wrote a book called paranoia or magic, and believe me,

632
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,920
那是这个领域的权威着作
It's the final word on the subject.

633
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:05,420
不好意思，米辽斯，假如你不介意，我想介绍一位我的朋友
Excuse me, Milius. If you don't mind, I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

634
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:09,420
- 小姐  - 她对你最喜欢的话题很感兴趣…
- Fraulein.  - She's interested in your favorite subject:

635
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:11,920
女巫
Witches.

636
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:15,420
你能跟她说一些神秘事物的事情吗？
Can you tell her something about the mysterious?

637
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:19,920
那么，我要走了，我有一个约会
Well, I have to go. I have an appointment to keep.

638
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:22,420
保持联络
Keep me posted, Hmm?

639
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:24,910
你好，我很抱歉打扰你
Hello. I'm sorry to bother you.

640
01:14:24,910 --> 01:14:29,420
啊，那你想要知道些什么呢？
Ah, so, what would you like to know?

641
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:32,920
- 你相信有女巫的存在吗？ - 啊
- Do you believe in the existence of witches?  - Ah.

642
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:36,920
我知道有些女人被称为女巫
I have known some women who are said to be witches.

643
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:40,420
- 真的吗？ - 我已经研究这个现象很久了
- Really?  - I have studied the phenomenon for a long time.

644
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:42,920
我的观点是那是同时期精神病学的
I am of the opinion that it is an important appendage...

645
01:14:43,410 --> 01:14:46,420
重要附属物
Of contemporary psychiatry.

646
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:48,420
你不相信吗，亲爱的？
You're skeptical, my dear.

647
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:51,920
坦白说，这有点让人难以相信
Well, frankly, it is a little hard to believe.

648
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:59,040
- 女巫是什么样的人？ - 她们是邪恶、消极和有毁灭性的
- What do witches do?  - They are malefic, negative and destructive.

649
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:03,540
她们对于神秘学的知识让她们得到极大的能力
Their knowledge of the art of the occult gives them tremendous powers.

650
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:09,040
她们能改变事物的发展和人的生命，但只会造成危害
They can change the course of events and people's lives, but only to do harm.

651
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:13,540
- 你不相信我吗？ - 不，我…
- You don't believe me?  - No, I...

652
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:17,040
她们的目标是累积个人财富
Their goal is to accumulate great personal wealth,

653
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:21,040
但只能藉由伤害别人来达到
But that can only be achieved by injury to others.

654
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:24,540
她们能引起痛苦、疾病，甚至是死亡…
They can cause suffering, sickness and even the death...

655
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:28,540
不管谁，不管任何理由，只要触怒她们
Of those who, for whatever reason, have offended them.

656
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,040
为什么你对神秘学有兴趣呢？
Why do you have all this interest in the occult?

657
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:37,040
因为有一些朋友跟我谈到女巫
Because some friends spoke to me about witches.

658
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:40,040
我也看过一些文献资料
I read some stuff.

659
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:43,040
你听说过“海莲娜玛蔻斯”吗？
Have you ever heard of Helena Markos?

660
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:46,540
喔，是的，她是一位非常着名的黑暗女王
Oh, yes. She was a very famous black queen.

661
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:49,540
一位拥有极大邪恶力量的天才女巫
A powerful witch with a tremendous talent for doing evil,

662
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:51,540
一位真正的魔法夫人
A real mistress of magic.

663
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:54,910
她居住并死在这个城市，你知道吗？
She lived and died in the city. Did you know that?

664
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:59,920
知道，那么这里可能有女巫公会吗？
Yes. And might there exist a guild of witches?

665
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,910
正确的说法应该是女巫集会
The correct term would be a coven of witches.

666
01:16:02,910 --> 01:16:05,920
一个女人成为女王，她的魔力就比…
A woman becomes queen of her magic is a hundred times more powerful...

667
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:08,920
集会里其他人强一百倍，就好像一条蛇
Than the rest of the coven, which is like a serpent.

668
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:12,910
它的力量取决于领导者，也就是取决于它的头
Its strength rests with its leader... That is, with its head.

669
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:16,920
一个失去领导者的集会就好像一条无头的眼镜蛇…
A coven deprived of its leader is like a headless cobra:

670
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,410
是无害的
Harmless.

671
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:23,410
现今的人类怀疑自然的精神力
Skepticism is the natural reaction of people nowadays,

672
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:26,420
但魔法至今是存在的
But magic is ever present.

673
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:30,290
换句话说
In other words:

674
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:37,790
魔法无处不在
Which means that magic is everywhere,

675
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:41,290
而且遍及全世界，这是个被确认的事实
And all over the world, it's a recognized fact.

676
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:44,460
一直都是
Always.

677
01:16:58,410 --> 01:17:01,410
玛克？玛克？
Mark? Mark?

678
01:17:09,910 --> 01:17:13,410
抱歉，大家去哪里了？
Excuse me. Where is everybody?

679
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:17,910
她们全都去剧院看波修瓦芭蕾的首演了
They have all gone to the theater for the opening of the Bolshoi.

680
01:17:17,910 --> 01:17:20,910
- 为什么没有人告诉我这件事？ - 我不知道
- Then why didn't anyone tell me about it?  - I don't know.

681
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:24,910
坦娜小姐把票发给每个学生
Miss Tanner obtained tickets for everyone.

682
01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:33,910
- 法兰克，我是苏西，莎拉的朋友  - 苏西？你好
- Frank, this is Suzy. Sara's friend?  - Suzy? Hello?

683
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:36,410
- 我不能…  - 说大声一点，我不能听得很清楚
- I can't...  - Talk louder. I can't hear you very well.

684
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:39,910
- 有什么事吗？ - 我还没听到莎拉的消息
- Did something happen?  - Well, I haven't heard from Sara,

685
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:42,910
但有很多奇怪的事情在发生
But a lot of strange things are happening.

686
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:46,280
我是说，例如当我吃晚餐时，我…
I mean, for example, when I eat at night, I...

687
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:49,530
哈罗？哈罗，法兰克？
Hello? Hello, Frank?

688
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:53,000
哈罗？你听到吗？
Hello? Can you hear me?

689
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,910
法兰克？哈罗？
Frank? Hello?

690
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:59,240
哈罗？哈罗？
Hello? Hello?

691
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,240
哈罗？
Hello?

692
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:06,240
哈罗，法兰克，你听到吗？
Hello, Frank, can you hear me?

693
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:39,740
不！
No!

694
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:46,740
不！
No!

695
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:31,650
她们根本没有离开学校
They don't leave the school at all.

696
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:36,610
前门在左边，她们的脚步声往右边走
The front door is on the left. Their footsteps are going to the right.

697
01:22:04,610 --> 01:22:09,610
二、三、四、五、六…
Two, three, four, five, six,

698
01:22:09,610 --> 01:22:12,570
七…
Seven...

699
01:22:15,070 --> 01:22:20,070
只要数出她们的脚步，我就可以找到她们去哪里
I can find out where they're going by counting their footsteps.

700
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,560
二十步
Twenty.

701
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:48,230
谁在那里？
Who's there?

702
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:34,390
地毯，这就是为什么脚步声会在这里停止
Carpet. That's why the footsteps stop here.

703
01:25:52,810 --> 01:25:56,300
这是不可能的，应该有其他的路离开这里
It's impossible. There's gotta be another way out of here.

704
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:07,600
秘密…我在门的后面看到！
The secret... I saw it behind the door!

705
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:10,970
三朵鸢尾花！转动蓝色的那朵！
Three Irises! Turn the blue one!

706
01:27:12,350 --> 01:27:15,340
秘密…我在门的后面看到！
The secret... I saw it behind the door!

707
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:18,100
三朵鸢尾花！转动蓝色的那朵！
Three Irises! Turn the blue one!

708
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:13,680
我告诉过你，我们必须除掉美国女孩那个婊子！
I told you: we must get rid of that bitch of an american girl!

709
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:19,050
消失…她必须消失！让她消失，明白吗？
Vanish...She must vanish! Make her disappear, understand?

710
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:25,540
她今晚没有吃也没有喝任何东西
She won't eat or drink anything this evening.

711
01:30:32,550 --> 01:30:36,040
消失…她必须消失！
Vanish...She must vanish!

712
01:30:36,170 --> 01:30:39,170
她必须死！死！死！
She must die, die, die!

713
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:49,420
海莲娜，给我力量！
Helena, give me power.

714
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:06,420
生病！生病吧！
Sickness! Sickness!

715
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:09,420
把她除掉！把麻烦除掉！
Away with her! Away with trouble!

716
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:14,420
死亡！死亡！死亡！
Death, death, death!

717
01:33:57,450 --> 01:34:00,700
现在死亡向你逼近了！
Now death is coming for you!

718
01:34:00,830 --> 01:34:05,330
你想杀了海莲娜玛蔻斯！
You wanted to kill helena Markos?

719
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:14,040
我在这儿，美国女孩！我来了！
Im here, american. Im coming!

720
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,990
你现在要和死亡相会了！活生生的死亡！
You're going to meet death now! The living dead!

721
01:37:44,340 --> 01:37:47,340
女巫，女巫
Witch, witch.
