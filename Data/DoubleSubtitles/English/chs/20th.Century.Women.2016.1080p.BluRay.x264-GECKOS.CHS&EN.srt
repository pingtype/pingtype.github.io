"好听的音乐"是用来掩盖

社会的不公与腐败的

And they don't have any skill, and they don't want skill

240
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,440
因为这样真的很有趣
because it's really interesting.

241
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,270
就是当你的热情超越了
What happens when your passion is bigger...

242
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,820

我对他的了解与日俱减
I know him less everyday.

256
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,440
他说那只是个游戏
He said it was just a game.

257
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,680
使劲呼吸 然后让另一个孩子勒住你的横膈膜
You breath real hard and another kid pulls on your diaphragm.

258
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,970
你就会晕倒

259
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,040
他说过几秒应该就会醒过来
He said you're supposed to come to a few seconds later.

What? You are not gonna talk to me now?

280
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,940
不说话的那个人不是我
I'm not the one who doesn't talk.

281
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,180
什么
What?

282
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,450
得了吧
Come on!

283
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,900
你都快把我吓死了
You scared the hell out of me.

284
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,570
你为什么要那样伤害自己
Why did you hurt yourself like that?

285
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,110
那你为什么不要命地抽烟
Why do you smoke yourself to death?

286
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,270
嘿
Hey.

287
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,730
为什么你无所谓自己那么悲伤和孤独 
Why are you fine being sad and alone?

288
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,300
我…
I...

289
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,050
我…你…
I... You...

290
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,720
你不能那样跟我说话 我们不…
You can't talk to me like that. We don't...

291
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,950
你不该跟我说那种话
You don't say that to me.

292
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:54,280
{\an8}Rudy Vallée- As Time Goes By

293
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,540
我觉得历史对人很残酷
I think History has been tough on men.

294
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:47,060
我是说他们不能做自己 也看不清未来会怎样
I mean they can't be what they were. And they can't figure out what's next.

295
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,270
我们在讨论什么来着
What are we talking about?

296
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,410
人?
Men?

297
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,080
我觉得是历史和人
I think history and men.

298
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,600
我的意思是 现如今你们的英雄是谁
I mean, who are your heroes now a days?

299
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,630
一群享有特权的瘾君子吗
A bunch of privileged drug addicts?

300
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,030
我觉得你们也许能替我帮助杰米
I think maybe you guys can help me with Jamie.

301
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,730
我觉得
I think...

302
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,610
他需要有人帮助他弄清楚
He needs help in figuring out...

303

在这种糟糕的境遇中如何做自己
how to be himself in all this mess.

304
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,400
而我不能在场
And I can't be there.

305
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,340
我不能在他身边
I can't be there with him.

306
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,680
我得放手
I have to let go.

307
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,060
是因为晕倒那事吗
Is this because the fainting thing?

308
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,610
他没事
He's fine.

309
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,990
不 是因为所有事
No. It's because of everything.

310
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,060
我不明白你要我们做什么
I don't understand what are you asking?

311
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,160
你要怎样才能成为一个优秀的人
How do you be a good man?

312
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,200
这话放在当下是什么意思
What does that even mean now a days?

313
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,490
他只有我
He has only got me.

314
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,530
这还…
It's just...

315
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,550
你们想想 这是不够的
Think about it, it's not enough.

316
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,870
你是认真的
You are serious.

317
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,730
- 是      - 那威廉呢
- Yeah.        - What about William?

318
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,450
威廉是男人 那…
William's a guy. That's...

319
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:41,250
他可以跟他聊聊男人的事
He can talk to him about guy things.

320
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,120
你见过他们聊天吗
Have you ever seen them have a conversation?

321
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,320
他们毫无共同点 根本聊不来
They have nothing in common, they don't connect.

322
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,490
这不管用的
It's just not working.

323
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,710
我是说 我考虑过了
I mean, I thought about that.

324
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,810
他…
He...

325
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,520
他喜欢你

还有你 他很喜欢你们俩
And you, He likes you a lot.

327
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:53,840
那…
That...

328
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,800
他是我朋友 我不想当他妈
That's my friend, I don't wanna be his mom.

329
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,790
没错 不 我才是他妈
Yeah, no, I'm his mom.

330
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,480
我是说 你不需要一个男人来帮他成长为男人吗
I mean, Don't you need a man to raise a man?

331
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,090
我不那样认为
No I don't think so.

332
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,020
我的意思是…
I mean...

333
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,240
我觉得能帮助他的是你们
I think you are what's gonna work for him.

334
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,020
我是说

335
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,610
你比谁都了解他
You know him better than anyone.

这点你知道的
You know that.

337
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,220
而且
And...

338
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:25,170
你关心他 你可以照顾他
You care about him, You can watch out for him.

339
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:28,700
而你 跟他分享你的生活就可以了
And you... just share your life.

340
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,030
你那么有天赋 让他看看你感兴趣的东西
You're talented person, show him you're interested in.

341

Oh...Go through this part of your life, it's not easy.

344

- You asked them to help me?        - Yeah.

346

No, they.. They get it.

347
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,280
所以她们同意了

你不担心吗
Aren't you worried?

375
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,760
他生我气了 这是他的应对方式
He's mad at me. And This is his way of dealing with it.

376
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,820
而且他有权利生气
And he has every right to be mad.

377
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,910
没错 但是如果这让他那么生气 可能就不是个好办法

不稳定
Unstable.

385
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,940

接着他会有能量危机

431
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,610
没关系的 吉夫斯 他回来了

我们去了喜达屋 看了场演出

00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,180

439
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,280
蒂姆・德莱姆射我里面了

我不想听这些屁话了
I don't wanna hear this shit.

441
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:05,190
我们溜进了一个娱乐中心的废旧泳池

And me and Tim ended up in his mom's Maverick.

445
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,270

00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,300
对不起
Sorry.

450
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,390

451
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,370
操
Fuck!

452
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,040
你准备怎么办
What're you gonna do?

453
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,640
不会有事的
It'll be fine.

454
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:13,130
你妈让我帮忙抚养你
Your mom asked me to like, help raise you.

455
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,300

00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,370
她是大萧条时期长大的
She was raised in the Depression.

457

每个人都在帮忙抚养别人

00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,080
我们来做心理治疗吧
Can we do therapy?

461
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,110
天啊 我现在不想做心理治疗

我自己可以的

469
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,490

你在给我拍照 但是...
And you're photographing me, but...

480
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,930
当你拍照的时候
While you are doing it...

481
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,180
你情难自已 开始触碰我
You can't help yourself and you start touching me.

482
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,820

你抚摸我
You touch me.

484

真的要这样吗
Really?

489
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,180
我不能就是我自己吗
I...can't just be myself?

490
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,180
不行
No.

Oh, you took it. I thought you are gonna say like 1, 2, 3...

500
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,510
- 不是 我只是在等待那个时刻      - 好的
- No. I just wait for the moment.        - Okay.

501
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,030
我得调整点东西

It's right here.

- 不好意思      - 没关系的
- I am sorry.        - No, it's alright.

504
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,290
我不介意
I don't mind.

505
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,960
我只是以前没拍过
I've just never done this before.

506
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,370
所以...
So...

507
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,560
我还有点紧张
I'm still little bit nervous.

508
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,600

519
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,690
她让朱莉参加她的青少年小组谈话
She makes Julie attend her teen group sessions.

520
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,890
有没有这种可能
How about the possibility?

521
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,360
你无意间选择了
That you're choosing boys who are inappropriate?

522
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,430
不合适的男孩子
Unconsciously.

523
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:51,370
她母亲再婚以后 朱莉变了
When her mother remarried, Julie changed.

524
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:55,260
当她同母异父且妹妹阿曼达一出生就得了脑瘫时
When her half sister Amanda was born...

525
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:57,350
她的变化更大了

526
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,420
你明白我说什么吗
You know what I mean.

527
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:05,010
你这样看起来好漂亮 整张脸美得冒泡
Wow. It looks really pretty on you, it just makes your whole face pop.

528
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,470
就像清新的苏打水一样
Like soda pop.

529
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,890

532
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,500
- 你为什么那么做      - 因为我疯了
- Why'd you do it?        - Because I'm crazy.

533
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,190
你宁可自己疯了
You wish you were crazy.

534
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,750
帮我挠挠
Scratch me.

535
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,270
我们应该沿着海岸往北走
We should go up the coast somewhere.

536
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,510
就你和我

《永远》 作者 朱迪・布鲁姆 1975年

541
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:07,090
一旦到达这个阶段 就不可能回到牵手之交
once you're there, you can't go back to holding hands.

542
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,080
一旦你在心理和生理上献出了自己
and once you give yourself both mentally and physically...

543
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,480
你就会变得极其脆弱
well, you're completely vulnerable.

544
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:13,050
他只关心他的新婚妻子和她的生日

《少有人走的路》 作者 M・斯科特・派克 1978年

550
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:31,310
最强大最有说服力的是
the most powerful and persuasive is the belief that

551
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:34,110
人们以为陷入爱情就是爱情
falling in love is love.

552
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:37,900
或者至少是爱情的一种表现
or at least one of the manifestations of love.

553
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:40,620
爱情应该是你感受到的一种感觉
Love is supposed to be a feeling that you feel.

554
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,780
人们说他们陷入爱情
People say that they're falling in love...

555
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,840
但他们并非真的陷入了爱情
but they're not actually falling in love.

556
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:48,380
那只是你自己感受到的与别人的错误联系
It's a fake connection that you feel with someone.

557
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,400
婚姻永远不应该存在
and marriage should never happen.

558
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,800
你早该去死了 该是你承受这些的
YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN YOU.

559
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,450

00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,450
没事的 进来吧
It's Okay, come in.

564
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,390
他还没起床呢
He's not up yet.

565
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,490
他昨天回来得挺晚的
He got in kinda late.

566
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,300
你可以帮我把这些东西端进去吗
You wanna help me bring this stuff in?

567
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,320
杰米还好吗
So is Jamie okay?

568
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,600
还好
Yeah.

569
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,850
他没什么事
He's okay.

570
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:09,360
他昨晚回来的时候我听到了
I heard by him come in last night.

571
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,460
我还没睡
I was awake.

572
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,300
好吧
Right.

573
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,610
我就是 睡不着
Yea, I was just, couldn't sleep.

574
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:20,390
等着听到他回来
so I was, you know, listening for him.

575
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,080
演出怎么样
How was the show?

576
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,420
挺好的
Good.

577
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,200
下次你出远门的时候
Next time you take a trip,

578
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,890
提前告诉我一声 好吗
just let me know, okay?

579
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,700
这样我晚饭就不会做多了
I won't make too much dinner.

580
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,110
来一起记股票吗
Hey, do the stocks with me?

581
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,590
可以
Yeah.

582
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,380
好的 IBM
Okay, IBM.

583
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,580
IBM 69.73美元
IBM, $69.73

584
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,480
施乐
Xerox.

585
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:15,930
你还好吗
You okay?

586
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,310
施乐 53.92美元
Xerox, $53.92.

587
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:24,940
- 住手      - 好的 53.92美元
- Stop.        - Okay, $ 53.92.

588
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,060
听着
Listen.

589
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,680
艾比今天要去见医生 我没法陪她去
Abbie has her appointment today and I can't be here...

590
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,490
我得去上班
And I have to go to work.

591
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,730
所以我希望在她回来的时候
So I was hoping that maybe you could be here.

592
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,260
你能在这儿
When she gets back.

593
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,390
可能她会需要精神支撑
In case she needs support.

594
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,030
她正在承受很多东西
She is going through a lot.

595
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,430
好的 万一...
Okay, What if it's..

596
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:43,930
有坏消息或是什么的要怎么办
Like bad news or something?

597
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:47,040
你可以处理的 如果你不能
Well, you can handle it or if you can't...

598
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,310
你总得学着去处理
You have to start somewhere.

599
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,070
男人总是觉得他们得
Men always feel like they have to

600
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,480
为女人弥补些什么
fix things for women...

601
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,770
但他们其实什么也没做
But they are not doing anything.

602
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:58,250
有些事情是无法弥补的
But some things just can't be fixed.

603
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,200
你只需要在场就好了
Just be there...

604
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,330
不知怎么 这对你们来说显得很难
Somehow, that's hard for all of you.

605
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,840
妈 我不是"所有男人"
Mom, I'm not "all men".

606
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,000
好吗 我就是我
Okay? I'm just me.

607
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,990
好吧 也对也不对
Well, yes and no.

608
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,080
要是我得做化疗
What if I have to have full on chemo?

609
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,220
或者子宫切除要怎么办
Or get a hysterectomy?

610
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,650
你知道那是什么吗
Do you know what that is?

611
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,190
听着 我应该干脆就陪你一起去
Look,I should just go with you. You know, I mean..

612
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:37,460
你妈妈确实叫我和你分享我的生活
Your mom did tell me to share my life with you.

613
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,600
是啊 我知道
Yeah I know.

614
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,140
你不必...
You don't...

615
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,620
不用在意 她是...
Don't worry about it, she just...

616
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,460
大萧条时期长大的
She's from The Depression.

617
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,190
是啊
Yeah.

618
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,380
这是好消息 艾比
It's good news， Abbie.

619
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,180
没有恶性细胞了
There were no malignant cells.

620
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,340
你的切片检查结果是良性的
Your biopsy is benign.

621
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,030
那...以后呢
And...in the future?

622
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,090
手术使你的子宫肌层受损
There was damage to the muscle wall from the surgery.

623
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,610
导致子宫颈机能不全
You have an incompetent cervix.

624
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,920
机能不全？
Incompetent?

625
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,870
妊娠时 不足以支撑到
It may not be strong enough...

626
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,760
妊娠期满
to go full term during pregnancy.

627
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,960
当胎儿长大
As the baby grows...

628
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,910
子宫颈扩张
the cervix widens.

629
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:44,430
如果子宫颈变松弛 就可能会过早张开
If it's weakened, it's likely to open prematurely.

630
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,000
我会没事的
I'm gonna be OK.

631
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:58,840
他说我很可能不能生孩子了
He said that I probably can't have kids.

632
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,630
生下杰米是不是
Was having Jamie like...

633
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:11,110
你一生中发生过的最重要的事
the biggest thing that ever happened to you?

634
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,320
我想是吧
I guess so.

635
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,840
抱歉
Sorry.

636
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,010
没事
No.

637
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,010
你能撑过去的
You'll get through this.

638
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:33,080
你会撑过去的
You will get through it.

639
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,790
你可以的
You will do it.

640
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:43,400
这是最艰难的时刻 接下来会发生的事是
This is the really hard part. And then what happens is,

641
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:46,410
在艰难的时刻之后 一切都会好起来
there's a hard part and then it gets better.

642
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,700
然后又会变糟 不过不用在意
And then it gets hard again, but never mind.

643
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:56,050
我不应该告诉你后面那部分的
I should not have told you that part.

644
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:59,780
我应该说 一切都会好起来的...就这样
I should've just said it gets better and then...That's it.

645
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:00,810
但是...
But...

646
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,490
你养鸟？
You got birds?

647
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,020
养鸟没关系吧
Is that ok?

648
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,050
没事
Yes.

649
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,750
你给他们取名了吗
So did you name them?

650
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,580
还没有
Not yet.

651
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:13,490
一只雄鸟 一只雌鸟
They are a boy and a girl.

652
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:17,200
而且它们是终身一夫一妻的
And, that, they are monogamous for life.

653
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:18,290
所以...
So...

654
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,620
如果其中一只死了 另一只...
If one of them dies, then the other one...

655
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,510
一周之后也会死去
He will die like a week later.

656
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,550
{\an8}墨西哥国王及王后

657
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,550
叫马克西米利安和卡洛塔怎么样
How about Maximilian and Carlotta?

658
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,440
我...
Right, I...

659
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:35,010
觉得它们配得上高贵的名字
You know, they deserve something grand.

660
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,360
他们终身都是一夫一妻呢
they're gonna be monogamous their whole lives.

661
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:39,220
是吧
Right?

662
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,770
马克西和卡洛塔真是好名字
Max and Carlotta are really good names.

663
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,290
所以
So...

664
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:59,970
你陪她去看了医生 还在那等她
You went to the doctor's and you waited with her.

665
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,020
是啊
Yeah.

666
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:06,740
但是我让你在这儿等着
But I told you to wait here.

667
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,480
我...呃...
I..um...

668
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,220
我想我最好还是
I thought it would be better to...

669
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,720
和她一起去 在那儿等着
go and really be there.

670
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,980
她很沮丧
She is really upset.

671
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:24,050
你应该也承受了不少吧
That must have been a lot to deal with.

672
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,640
我还好
I'm fine.

673
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,340
我没事
I'm good.

674
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,240
我...
I...

675
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,550
我学到了很多
I learned a lot

676
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,570
阿比盖尔・波特
Abigail Porter.

677
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,790
女性在家就能安全快捷方便地
Home pregnancy tests that...

678
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,850
进行的验孕测试
Women can do safely and easily.

679
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:49,020
这是女性掌控自己人生的
A small revolution for...

680
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:51,690
一个小型革命
women seeking to take control of their lives.

681
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,270
这是什么东西
What the fuck is this?

682
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:16,470
验孕的
It's a pregnancy test.

683
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:25,570
艾比的医生说
Abbie's doctors said that...

684
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,250
她生不了孩子
She wouldn't be able to have kids.

685
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:32,660
她干嘛带你一起去
Why'd she take you?

686
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:39,220
- 就这些了?      - 对
- Is that all of it?        - Yeah.

687
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,940
好多啊
That's a lot.

688
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:43,890
现在干嘛
Now what?

689
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:47,140
摇晃十秒
Shake for 10 seconds.

690
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,720
好了
Okay.

691
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,800
静置两小时
Leave undisturbed for 2 hours.

692
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:10,530
两小时？
2 hours?

693
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,030
这上面是这么写的
that's what it says.

694
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:21,360
好了 如果出现一个环 结果就是阳性的
Okay. If it appears then you're positive,

695
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:24,250
如果没有出现 那就是阴性的
And if no ring appears here then the test is negative.

696
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,560
那这两小时我们干嘛
What do we do for two hours?

697
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:39,820
男人不那样抽烟 不要那样拿
Guy's don't smoke like that. Don't hold it like that.

698
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,840
要...
Like...

699
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:42,830
这样
This.

700
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:44,790
夹在两根手指中间
Between your two fingers.

701
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,240
- 这样？      - 是的 这样好多了
- That?        - Yes, that's better.

702
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:51,840
好 现在 走路
Okay now, walk,

703
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:55,040
拿着烟很酷地走路
do like a cool cigarette walk.

704
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:07,340
男人不会看起来像是在想他们看起来是什么样的
Guys aren't supposed look like they're thinking about what they look like.

705
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:10,940
看我的
Watch me.

706
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,250
看到了吗
See?

707
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,150
抽烟很恶心
Smoking is gross.

708
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:25,660
不 不恶心
No, it's not.

709
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,030
会让你得癌症
Gives you cancer.

710
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,340
这只是我的观点 我认为坚强...
This is just my opinion, I think being strong..

711
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:34,730
是最重要的品质
..is the most important quality.

712
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:38,470
不是脆弱 不是敏感
It's not being vulnerable, It's not being sensitive.

713
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,540
甚至不是诚实 也不是快乐
It's not even... Honestly, it's not even being happy.

714
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:43,750
关乎力量
It's about strength.

715
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:47,250
和你忍受其他情绪的能力
And your durability against the other emotions.

716
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:59,190
没有环
No ring.

717
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:02,050
没有环
No ring.

718
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,690
- 嘿      - 嘿
- Hey.        - Hey.

719
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:16,960
谢谢你陪我去
Thanks for going with me.

720
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:19,900
没事
Yeah, totally.

721
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,340
我做了这个给你
I made you this.

722
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:24,590
- 一个合集磁带      - 没错
- It's a mixed tape.         - Yep.

723
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:30,130
这里面的几首歌 是我觉得
These are bunch of songs, that I think my life...

724
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,910
如果我在年少的时候就能听到它们
would have been better if they would have been around.

725
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,180
我的人生会比现在更好
When I was a teenager.

726
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:38,740
所以我希望 如果你现在就能听到这些歌
So I'm hoping, that if you listen to them, now...

727
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:42,290
你会成为我所期望成为的那个
you'll be a happier and more realized person...

728
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:44,590
更快乐 更丰满的人
than I could ever hope to be.

729
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,020
艾比・波特 生于1955年

730
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,250
从那晚起
From that night on...

731
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:55,390
艾比开始和我无话不说
Abbie started telling me everything.

732
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,650
她在圣巴巴拉长大
She grew up in Santa Barbara.

733
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,460
那里的每个人都很快乐
Where everyone is happy.

734
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:02,500
但这让她很抓狂
but that just made her feel crazy.

735
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:07,020
1973年 她搬到了纽约
In 1973 she moved to New York City...

736
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,260
进入艺术学校学习
and went to Art school.

737
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:11,230
纽约让她有同样的感觉
New York City made her feel same.

738
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:12,970
她那时一团糟
She was so fucked up.

739
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:16,130
后来 她爱上了摄影
She fell in love with photography.

740
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,050
她学会了难过的时候就跳舞
She learned to dance when she got sad.

741
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,300
她看了《天外来客》
She saw "The Man Who Fell to Earth"...

742
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,840
把自己的头发染成了红色
And dyed her hair red.

743
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:27,620
我知道了该如何被
I figured out how to be looked at ...

744
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:31,060
男人欣赏 以及...
by men, and...

745
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:32,710
如何让他们
How to make them...

746
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:36,790
既兴奋又难受
excited and uncomfortable.

747
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:40,810
我很混蛋 很愤怒
I am so cocky and I was so angry.

748
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:43,130
也很快乐
And I was so happy.

749
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:49,210
她爱上了她的老师
She fell in love with her teacher.

750
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,910
- 然后她去了计生所堕胎      - 艾比盖尔・波特
- Then she went to Planned Parenthood.        - Abigail Porter.

751
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:06,570
她的朋友没法承受她得癌症的事实
Her friends couldn't deal with her having cancer.

752
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,040
所以她回家找她妈妈去了
So she went home to her mom.

753
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:10,520
嗨 妈
Hey Mom.

754
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:13,950
盖尔 你怀艾比的时候
Gail, did you ever take DES?

755
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:15,850
服用过已烯雌酚吗
When you were pregnant with Abe?

756
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,800
是的
Yes.

757
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:21,780
怀艾比之前我流产过两次
I had two miscarriages before Abbie,

758
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,350
医生建议我服用的
the doctor told me to take it.

759
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:28,780
己烯雌酚是种助孕药物
DES was a fertility medication.

760
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:31,060
医生会开这种药给女性
Doctors prescribed it to women.

761
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:34,240
后来他们发现
Later they found out that the daughters...

762
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,960
那些用药者的女儿
of the women who took it...

763
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,590
会得宫颈癌
Got cervical cancer.

764
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:41,280
我不知道你流过产
I didn't know that you had miscarriages.

765
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:46,430
在她母亲发现这是她服用药物造成的之后
When her mom found out it was because she took that drug...

766
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:48,550
她不愿再提这件事
she wouldn't talk about it.

767
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:51,190
而且艾比做的任何事
And everything Abbie did

768
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,650
都会让她恼火不已
made her mad.

769
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,750
所以艾比换了个地方住
So Abbie looked for another place to live.

770
00:50:58,470 --> 00:50:59,850
-嗨      -你好
- Hi.        - Hello.

771
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,110
她租了楼上的房间
And she started renting the room upstairs.

772
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:04,560
我叫艾比
I'm Abbie.

773
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,430
然后在新闻社找了份工作
And she got a job at the news press.

774
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:33,090
- 嗨 多萝西娅      - 嗨 查理
- Hi Dorothea.        - Hi, Charlie.

775
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:40,970
嗨
Hi.

776
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,380
你想出去玩玩吗
You wanna go out sometime?

777
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,190
喝点东西？
Get a drink?

778
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:55,170
好啊
Yeah.

779
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:58,810
什么情况 查理
What the heck, Charlie?

780
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:00,490
当然可以
Sure.

781
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:02,070
好呀
okay.

782
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:04,170
我之前还不确定
I wasn't sure.

783
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,760
怎么了
What?

784
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:09,460
有些家伙以为你是女同志
Some of the guys thought you are a lesbian.

785
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,260
你懂的
You know.

786
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:12,990
如果你是的话 我也没问题
Which I don't have a problem if you are.

787
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:14,910
可你不是
But you are not.

788
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:17,590
你知道我不是的
You know I'm not.

789
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,020
那我们还能出去吗
Shall we go out then?

790
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:27,240
好啊 可以
Okay, yeah.

791
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:31,880
当然 你想什么时候再来我家吃晚餐吗
Sure. You wanna come to dinner at my house again sometime?

792
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:35,150
很好
Good...

793
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,640
我们就这么做吧
We could do that.

794
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,180
可恶
Shit!

795
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,600
朱莉
Julie.

796
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,660
真的没有什么
It's really, it's nothing.

797
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:30,880
我只在那过夜过几次而已
I just end up there sometimes.

798
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:33,650
你们都做些什么
What do you guys do?

799
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,820
我就睡觉
I just sleep.

800
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,780
我们会聊天
We talk.

801
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:45,630
能给来我一根吗
Can I have one?

802
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:48,720
不行 抽烟对你有害
No, they are really bad for you.

803
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,260
可你自己也抽个不停
You smoke all the time.

804
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:55,830
我开始抽烟的时候烟还不是有害的 只是为了时髦
You know, when I started they weren't bad for you.They were just stylish.

805
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:57,210
可以说是很前卫
Sort of edgy, so...

806
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,110
所以对我来说不一样
It's different for me.

807
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:06,700
行吧
Okay.

808
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,130
你很擅长隐藏秘密啊
You're good at hiding stuff, huh?

809
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:21,720
我妈称之为情绪划分
My mom calls it compartmentalizing.

810
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:23,800
显然我经常这么做
Apparently I do that a lot.

811
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,190
你在帮助他吗
Are you helping him?

812
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,100
我正在努力
I am trying.

813
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,140
真的吗
Really?

814
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:38,620
那你呢
What about you?

815
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:41,260
你想过你对他的影响吗
Have you thought about your impact on him?

816
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:45,140
这都是和母亲有关系的
It's always about the mother.

817
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:50,850
比如说离开他爸之后 你向前看了吗
Like, do you think you've moved on, since his dad?

818
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:55,010
你知道你才不是什么心理医生吧
You know that you're not actually a therapist?

819
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:00,490
我交往过几个男人 好吗
I've had new guys, okay?

820
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:04,730
没一个是合适的
No one appropriate.

821
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:07,810
合适的？
Appropriate?

822
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:13,200
都是些你不愿为之冒险的男人
Guys you're not going to risk anything with.

823
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:17,280
甚至是你都不喜欢的男人
Men you don't even really like.

824
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:20,570
听着 你才十七岁好吗
Listen, you're 17, Okay?

825
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:23,740
也许你根本看不出我真心喜欢的那些男人
Maybe you don't know what's good about these guys.

826
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:25,090
身上的优点
That I really like.

827
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,830
我说的是你
I'm talking about you.

828
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:31,880
你好像从来都不投入
You never seem into it.

829
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,500
除了对威廉
Except for with William.

830
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:37,840
可是
But...

831
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:40,450
他不合适
He is inappropriate.

832
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:44,940
好吧 天哪
Okay, Jesus.

833
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:46,380
没错
Yeah.

834
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,040
要找到我喜欢的人很难
It's hard to find someone that I like.

835
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:56,010
我曾经有过机会 两次
I had my chance, twice.

836
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,880
但是结果都未能如愿
But that part of life just didn't work out for me.

837
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:10,890
- 再见      - 再见
- Bye.        - Bye.

838
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:48,840
你去哪了
Where were you?

839
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:52,890
我出去办了点事
I had some errands.

840
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:57,560
你把整个表都填完了?
You did the whole list?

841
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,820
你知道每只股票吗
You know all the stocks?

842
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:01,610
对啊
Yeah.

843
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,850
IBM写到下面去了
IBM is down.

844
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:08,040
抱歉 我下次会改过来的
Sorry, I'll fix it next time.

845
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,950
你干得不错
Good job on that.

846
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:28,510
威廉
William.

847
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:29,550
在
Yes.

848
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:33,240
你觉得我在停滞不前吗
Do I seem stuck to you?

849
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,670
你指什么
How do you mean?

850
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:44,900
我应该不知道吧 对吗
Well, I guess I wouldn't know, Would I?

851
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:53,100
- 艾比      - 嗯？
- Abbie.        - Yes?

852
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,230
我们今晚出去玩吧
Let's go out tonight.

853
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,080
我想看看这个现代世界
I want to see this modern world.

854
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,760
我能一起去吗
Can I go?

855
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:28,390
我知道能不能在这找到合适的男人
I don't know if I'm going to find an appropriate man here.

856
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:30,750
谢谢你
Thank you.

857
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,100
这是什么
What was that?

858
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:57,740
这是什么意思
What does that mean?

859
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,890
在搞清楚什么意思之前别乱亲女人
Don't kiss a woman if you unless you know what you mean by it.

860
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:15,020
你不是在和艾比上床吗
Aren't you sleeping with Abbie?

861
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:20,370
那不是认真的 只是...
That's not something serious, is...

862
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,900
那为什么还这么做
Then why do it?

863
00:59:56,820 --> 01:00:00,560
那是1979年 我55岁
It's 1979, I am 55 years old...

864
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:03,220
这是我儿子所笃信的
This is what my son believes in.

865
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:05,440
就是这种人
These people.

866
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:09,410
顶着这种发型 穿着这种衣服
With this hair... And these clothes.

867
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,770
摆出这种姿势 发出这种声响
Making these gestures, making these sounds.

868
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,930
那是1979年 我55岁
It's 1979 and I am 55 years old...

869
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:21,880
在1999年 我会因为抽烟死于癌症
and in 1999 I'll die of cancer from smoking.

870
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:27,610
嘿
Hey!

871
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,190
- 你要走了吗      - 对
- You going?        - Yeah.

872
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:35,270
帮我个忙 照顾好艾比
Do me a favor, just take care of Abbie.

873
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:41,360
他们没有意识到这是朋克的终结 
They don't know this is the end of punk.

874
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,080
他们也没想到里根会上台
 They don't know that Reagan's coming.

875
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:50,020
难以想象这些孩子会停止幻想核战
It's impossible to imagine that kids will stop dreaming about nuclear war.

876
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:53,260
而对气候危机提心吊胆
And have nightmares about the weather.

877
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,050
难以想象的还有艾滋病
It's impossible to imagine HIV.

878
01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:00,070
以及滑板的技巧
what will happen with skateboard tricks.

879
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,280
还有互联网
The Internet...

880
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:06,200
- 你玩得开心吗      - 嗯 挺好玩的
- Did you have a good time?        - Yeah, it was interesting.

881
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,830
- 艾比有你的电话 对吗      - 对
- So Abbie has your number, right?        - Yeah.

882
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:15,570
- 改天请你来吃晚饭      - 好呀
- Give you a call for dinner.        - I would like that.

883
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:24,830
孩子
Kid...

884
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,280
很晚了
It's late...

885
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,260
那儿怎么样
How was it?

886
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:36,720
让人宛如新生
It was life changing.

887
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:53,870
在我死前 我会为千禧虫危机的到来做准备
Before I die, I will prepare for Y2K.

888
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:56,990
我在车库备好罐头食物和水
I will put canned food and water in the garage.

889
01:01:57,930 --> 01:02:01,210
我把价值一万六千美元的金币
I put 16 thousand dollars worth of gold coins...

890
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:04,590
存进蒙特西托银行的保险箱里
into a safe deposit box at the Bank of Montecito.

891
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:11,670
我在新千年之前就死了
I died before the New Year...

892
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:15,500
海豚型气球在我头顶飘来飘去
Dolphin-shaped balloons floated over my head.

893
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,650
人们用音响播放着路易斯・阿姆斯特朗的音乐
They were playing Louis Armstrong on a Boombox.

894
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:24,310
{\an8}Louis Armstrong - Basin Street Blues?

895
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:34,690
杰米？
Jamie?

896
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:39,240
抱歉 你醒着吗
Sorry, are you awake...?

897
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:45,870
我只是想告诉你 你得离开这个地方
I just wanted to tell you that you have to get out of this town.

898
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:48,190
如果你想要有机会...
If you want to have any chance...

899
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:50,310
过上有趣的生活
of an interesting life moving forward.

900
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:51,340
发生什么了
What happened?

901
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,400
抱歉 妈呀
Sorry, shit!

902
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,830
我们不做爱
We don't have sex.

903
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,320
我只是在这睡觉
I just sleep here.

904
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,120
好吧
Okay...

905
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:09,930
- 我能躺下吗      - 我们正在睡觉
- Can I lay down?        - We were sleeping.

906
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,730
- 忍忍吧      - 没关系的 我就想要...
- Just get over.        - It' Okay, I'm just gonna talk...

907
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,460
和杰米说几句话
to Jamie for a second...

908
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:19,730
莉奈特・温特斯朝我吐了口水
So Lynette Winters spit on me.

909
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:21,070
然后我揍了她
So then I hit her.

910
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:23,990
- 她为什么朝你吐口水      - 因为我朝她吐口水了
- Why'd she spit on you?        - Because I spit on her.

911
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:25,820
我就快要去纽约了
Right before I was going to New York

912
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:27,640
我心想我再也不回来了
and I thought I was never gonna come back.

913
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:29,940
当时觉得全身无比释放
It felt very liberating at the time.

914
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:33,400
最后我不知怎地还砸烂了一把椅子
And somehow I ended up breaking a chair.

915
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:38,480
- 嗨 朱利安 不好意思      - 你没事吧
- Hey Julian, I'm sorry.        - You okay?

916
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:39,700
嗯嗯 我没事
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

917
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,050
然后威廉告诉我
And then William told me...

918
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:45,750
他不想再和我上床了
he didn't wanna sleep with me anymore.

919
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:48,560
你在说什么 我又不喜欢你
What are you saying? I don't like you...

920
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:50,190
我不喜欢你 我不喜欢…
I don't like you. I don't like...

921
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,010
我只…
Just...

922
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:56,550
我只要跟杰米说几句话
I'm just gonna talk to Jamie for a second...

923
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:59,450
你不能让她睡在这
You can not let her sleep here.

924
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:04,090
如果她不和你上床 这样对你不好
If she's not having sex with you, it's dis-empowering.

925
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:10,500
还有 你得在去墨镜店工作前
Also you need to get out of this town before you start working.

926
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:12,510
就离开这个地方
at a sunglasses shop...

927
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:16,930
对你来说也是一样的
and it goes for you too.

928
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:35,400
杰米 给你几本书
Jamie, here is some books...

929
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,040
我在女权主义课上拿的
from a feminism class I took...

930
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:38,820
我想它们能帮助你
I thought it would be helpful for you,

931
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:40,330
了解女性的视角
to get a woman's perspective.

932
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,130
- 你的嘴唇怎么了      - 我打架了
- What happened to your lip?        - I got in a fight.

933
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:45,830
- 什么      - 我打了一架
- What?        - There was a fight.

934
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:47,250
当时很荒唐
It was, it was ridiculous...

935
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:48,980
等等 这是《身体与自我》吗
Hold on, is that "Our Bodies Our Selves"?

936
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:52,330
这本书很不错
This is a really good book...

937
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,800
有一章节特别棒
There is a very good chapter...

938
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:58,160
关于家中分娩的
On home births.

939
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:03,370
家中分娩遏制了婴儿的成长人格
Home births actually stunts the baby's growth personality.

940
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:07,070
- 成长人格是个什么东西      - 是个真的术语
- What is a growth personality?        - It's a real term.

941
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:11,760
谁能知道对于新生儿来说
Who knows what it means for a new born...

942
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:12,980
看到木质的墙壁
to see wood walls, and...

943
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,380
和铺上地毯的地板
carpeted floors and to smell...

944
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:18,070
闻到人类真实的气息
real human smells and to feel...

945
01:05:18,110 --> 01:05:20,280
感受到羊毛 棉质 法兰绒的触感
wool and cotton and flannel clothes...

946
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:22,840
而不是死气沉沉的 苍白的
instead of starchy, white...

947
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,360
无味的东西意味着什么呢
deodorized...

948
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,870
对我来说 那就像… 还有什么呢
To me, that meant like… and what else?

949
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:34,520
{\an8}Neu! - Lila Engel (Lila Angel)?

950
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:39,650
《高潮的法则》 作者 苏珊・莱登 1970年

951
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:38,140
女性的性行为
Women's sexuality,

952
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:40,340
由男性定义并取悦男性
defined by men to benefit men.

953
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:44,700
一直被轻视 扭曲 压抑和控制
has been downgraded and perverted, repressed and channeled.

954
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,710
在解剖学上 所有性高潮都以阴蒂为中心
Anatomically, all orgasms are centered in the clitoris.

955
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:52,020
通过人工对阴蒂直接触压
whether they result from direct manual pressure applied to the clitoris.

956
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,000
或是通过间接触压…
indirect pressure resulting from...

957
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:57,280
我狠狠地操了海瑟 她高潮了三次
I fucked Heather so hard, she came like three times.

958
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:03,410
- 你怎么刺激她的阴蒂的      - 用我的鸡巴
- How did you stimulate her clitoris?        - With my dick.

959
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:08,800
女性需要对阴蒂的直接刺激
Women need direct clitoral stimulation.

960
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,950
例如用手指或振动棒等等
Like with fingers, or vibrators, or something.

961
01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:15,040
她很可能是装的
She probably faked it.

962
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,550
女人常常假装高潮
women fake it all the time.

963
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,840
传声头乐队就是一群基佬
Talking Heads are a bunch of fags.

964
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:22,960
其实他们乐队里还有个女生
Actually there's a girl in their band...

965
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,420
而且她在和鼓手交往 所以...
And she's dating the drummer, so...

966
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,600
她叫简妮尔
Her name is Janior...

967
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:33,560
叫你乱讲话 臭基佬
Fuckin' around faggot.

968
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,710
所以是为了什么打架
So, what was the fight about?

969
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:49,890
刺激阴蒂
Clitoral stimulation.

970
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,520
为什么你们要为此打架
Why do you need to fight about that?

971
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:59,910
我不知道 我想做个好男人
I don't know, I wanna be a good guy...

972
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:01,780
好吗 我就想…
Okay. I just wanna...

973
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:05,560
能够满足女人
be able to satisfy a woman.

974
01:07:13,390 --> 01:07:15,470
孩子 我相信你会的
Kid, I'm sure you will.

975
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:32,060
妈的
Shit!

976
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:36,590
{\an8}文艺基佬

977
01:07:34,070 --> 01:07:35,290
杰米
Jamie!

978
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:37,550
这一点都不酷
That's not cool...

979
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:41,430
对 马特就是这么叫我的 因为我喜欢传声头乐队
Yeah, That's what Matt called me. For liking the talking heads.

980
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:50,350
- 黑旗又是什么      - 一支硬核乐队
- And what is Black Flag?        - It's a hardcore band.

981
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:51,020
所以...
So...

982
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:54,660
喜欢黑旗的人都会讨厌传声头乐队
The people who love Black Flag, hate the Talking Heads.

983
01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:56,990
什么东西
What?

984
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:00,540
朋克界内部不太和
The punk scene is very divisive.

985
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,360
嘿
Hey!

986
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:05,540
你们都很前卫啊 是不是
You are all so advanced, aren't you?

987
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:10,220
下次有男生跟你聊他们的性事
The next time a guy tells you a sex story...

988
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:13,740
你只需要同意他说的每句话
You just have to agree with everything he says...

989
01:08:13,770 --> 01:08:15,030
假装他是对的就行了
and act like it's right.

990
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:18,880
哪怕是错的 因为他们不喜欢被反驳
Even if it's not, because they don't wanna be contradicted.

991
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:21,180
他们只想活在自己幻想的世界里
They just wanna to live in their fantasy lands.

992
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:25,260
你都是怎么处理
How are you dealing?

993
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:27,180
每件事的
With everything.

994
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,360
无论你如何想象你未来的人生
Whatever you think your life is going to be like,

995
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:48,740
你要明白 现实总会完全不同
just know, it's not going to be anything like that.

996
01:08:52,990 --> 01:08:53,990
好吧
Right...

997
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:11,300
带我去那个酒吧吧
Take me to that club.

998
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:17,890
今晚吗
Tonight?

999
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:21,850
- 嘿      - 嗨
- Hey.        - Hi..

1000
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:25,680
哇 你看起来真美 你们要去哪
Wow, you look amazing... Where are you going?

1001
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:27,910
我们想出去玩 可以吗
We're just gonna go out... Is that okay?

1002
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:30,220
当然可以了 要去哪
Oh yeah, of course... And where to?

1003
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:32,020
就出去外面
Just going out.

1004
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:36,420
- 再见      - 再见
- Bye.        - Bye.

1005
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:56,240
把它藏起来
Hide it there.

1006
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,580
嘿 能给我瓶啤酒吗
Hey, can I have a beer?

1007
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:05,710
现在说 “我喜欢年纪比我大的女人”
Now say I'm into older women.

1008
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:07,720
- 什么      - 快说
- What?        - Just say it.

1009
01:10:08,770 --> 01:10:10,320
我喜欢年纪比我大的女人
I'm into older women.

1010
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:14,340
你几岁了
How old are you?

1011
01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:16,790
年龄是中产阶级才有的概念
Age is a bourgeois construct.

1012
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,710
年龄是中产阶级才有的概念
Age is a bourgeois construct.

1013
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,360
回答得不错
It's a good answer.

1014
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:26,140
- 年龄是...      - 好了好了 可以了
- Age is...        - Ok, ok, you've got it.

1015
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:29,970
听着 现在如果她问你太多问题
So now, if she asks too many questions...

1016
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:32,230
你就尽量少回答 好吗
You just say as little as possible, okay?

1017
01:10:33,690 --> 01:10:35,880
现在让我看看你最深不可测的表情
Now show me your most inscrutable face.

1018
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:53,600
我其实不会主动去挑...女人
I don't really make choices… About women...

1019
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:54,630
她们会…
They just...

1020
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:56,130
她们会自己送上门
They come to you.

1021
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:59,720
那...你本来可以找到更好的
That's… You could have more than that.

1022
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:04,980
那你呢 为什么…
But what about you? Why...?

1023
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,960
我的意思是 杰米的父亲怎么了
I mean, what happened to Jamie's dad?

1024
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:18,670
他只是变得和我以为的不一样了
He just didn't turn out like I thought he would.

1025
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:22,460
我想也是
I guess that happens...

1026
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:25,120
他肯定还是有些优点的
There must've been something good about him.

1027
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:33,130
- 他是左撇子      - 就这样？
- He was left handed?        - That's it?

1028
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:34,600
就这样？
That's it?

1029
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:41,430
然后我是右撇子 所以每天早上
And I was right handed. And so... In the morning...

1030
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:44,570
我们会一起看股票报告 然后…
We would look at the stock reports together and...

1031
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:50,740
他可以边用左手写字 边用右手挠我的背
He could write with his left hand and scratch my back with his right.

1032
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:59,080
- 就是这样      - 我特别喜欢
- And that's it!        - I loved that.

1033
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:05,360
你冥想过吗
Do you ever meditate?

1034
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:14,350
我感受空气 感受空气的寒冷 穿过我的鼻子
I feel the air... coldness of the air. Goes through my nose...

1035
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:17,130
我要做的就是...
All I'm really doing is...

1036
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:23,530
将注意力集中到我的呼吸上
Bringing my attention back to my breath.

1037
01:12:23,890 --> 01:12:26,170
所以在我吸气时
So when I take a breathe in...

1038
01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:28,940
我会感觉到
There is a feeling...

1039
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:31,490
空气流入
Air going in...

1040
01:12:33,230 --> 01:12:34,680
空气流出
Air going out...

1041
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,160
感觉真好
It's a good feeling.

1042
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,450
没关系 我只是要…
It's okay..good... I'm just gonna...

1043
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:50,140
继续
Go ahead...

1044
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:52,390
我只是想抽个烟
I'm just gonna smoke...

1045
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:55,100
我听着呢
I'm listening...

1046
01:12:57,150 --> 01:13:01,130
- 我想要和你同步      - 你真的是...
- I wanna get on the same page.        - You are such...

1047
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:05,070
你是怎么变成现在这个样子的
How did you get to be this person that you are?

1048
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:07,460
你真的很不同寻常
It's so... You're so unusual.

1049
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:14,550
威廉的父亲在克利夫兰开了一家汽车维修店
William's dad managed an auto repair shop in Cleveland.

1050
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,200
他一直很懂引擎
 Engines always made sense to him.

1051
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:22,830
他本想坚持读完大学 可是付不起学费
He tried to put himself through college, but couldn't afford it.

1052
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:30,270
他在1963年遇见了特丽莎
He met Theresa in 1963,

1053
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:33,020
她聪明勇敢 经济条件也好
she was smart, brave, better off,...

1054
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:36,180
他们相爱了 一起搬去奥克兰
they were in love. They moved to Oakland,

1055
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:38,530
{\an8}塞瓦斯托波尔: 前苏联克里米亚半岛西南岸港市

1056
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:38,530
然后去了塞瓦斯托波尔的一个公社
Then, to a commune in Sevastopol.

1057
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:39,930
我学着变成他们那样
Well I learned to be like them.

1058
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:40,960
你懂吗
You know?

1059
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:45,800
结果这比我想象中简单得多
As it turns out, it was a lot easier than I thought it would be.

1060
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,620
但那不是真正的我 我这么做是
but it wasn't really me. I was doing it for...

1061
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,320
为了不失去特丽莎
So that I wouldn't lose Theresa.

1062
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:56,680
于是他变得看起来像他们 说话也像他们
He started looking like them, talking like them...

1063
01:13:56,750 --> 01:14:00,500
但他们让他觉得自己苍老 无知和贫穷
but they made him feel old and uneducated and poor.

1064
01:14:01,390 --> 01:14:02,900
特丽莎开始觉得...
Theresa started thinking...

1065
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:05,930
威廉保守刻板而且占有欲很强 便离开了他
William was uptight and possessive and she left him.

1066
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:08,820
在特丽莎之后
After Theresa...

1067
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:10,550
什么样的女人我都可以
Women didn't have to look one way or the other.

1068
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:12,050
不必是特定的类型
Or be a certain way.

1069
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:17,580
我觉得我只要...
I think that I just...

1070
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:21,790
我只想赢得她们 这样我就不至于寂寞了
I want to win them over so that I won't be lonely.

1071
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:24,640
- 你住这里吗      - 对的
- You live here?        - I do.

1072
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:27,390
但是我一旦得到他们
But, once I have them...

1073
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:29,310
就不知道该对她们怎么办了
I don't really know what to do with them.

1074
01:14:38,130 --> 01:14:41,530
- 你等会想做点什么      - 睡觉
- You want to do something later?        - Sleep.

1075
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:44,410
我该走了
I should go.

1076
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:48,430
他的爱好是制作陶碗
What he likes is making bowls...

1077
01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:51,120
那时他闻起来不再是机油和润滑油的味道了
He doesn't smell like oil and grease...

1078
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:53,970
他的手也不再像是汽修工的粗手了
his hands don't look like a dumb mechanic's hands.

1079
01:14:54,050 --> 01:14:59,980
我先用了一段时间的小碗 然后我觉得我需要...
I've been using smaller bowls for a while, then I was kinda feeling like I need…

1080
01:15:01,820 --> 01:15:05,140
然后等它变得干点之后…
And when it gets little bit drier...

1081
01:15:10,050 --> 01:15:11,240
它很漂亮
It's beautiful.

1082
01:15:17,090 --> 01:15:18,220
什么情况
What?

1083
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:22,410
是你修好的嘛
Did you fix it?

1084
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:24,780
这个嘛 可能吧
Well, maybe.

1085
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:28,050
它有部分是大众汽车的
It's part of Volkswagen now.

1086
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:29,680
我临时改装了一下
I had to improvise.

1087
01:15:56,890 --> 01:15:59,920
那你要怎么认识别人呢
And how you're gonna get to know a person way over there?

1088
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:06,500
- 我该怎么做      - 你就随便聊聊
- What am I supposed to do?        - Just make a little small talk.

1089
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:09,500
介绍你自己 邀请她跳舞
Introduce yourself... ask her to dance...

1090
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,230
- 好吧 你好 我是威廉      - 你好
- Okay, hello I am William...        - Hello...

1091
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:16,770
你好 我住在你楼下
Hello... I live downstairs...

1092
01:16:16,830 --> 01:16:18,620
- 喔对      - 和车住一块
- Yeah.        - With the cars...

1093
01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:23,740
- 你愿意和我跳舞吗      - 当然
- Would you like to dance with me?        - Yes, sure.

1094
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:24,650
好吧
Okay.

1095
01:16:24,690 --> 01:16:29,920
伸出你的手来 然后把另一只手放在这里
Put your hand out right. Put the other hand here and just be there...

1096
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:37,290
- 她想要的就是陪伴      - 喔 好的
- All she wants is a little company.        - Oh good...

1097
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:41,530
很好
That's nice.

1098
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:58,340
{\an8}David Bowie- DJ?

1099
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:17,430
我觉得我可以理解你
I feel like I understand you.

1100
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:23,180
我们应该逃离这里 就你和我 你懂吗
We should get away from here. It's just me and you, you know?

1101
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:25,920
沿着海边往北 去某个地方独处
Go up the coast... Be alone somewhere.

1102
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:30,310
杰米 你爱的是朱莉
Jamie, You are in love with Julie...

1103
01:17:35,370 --> 01:17:37,370
你不能这样任她摆布
You can't let it push you around.

1104
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:39,980
你得告诉她你想要的
You have to tell her what you want.

1105
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:53,520
要是你那时候在听的话...
If you were to listen to it...

1106
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:57,180
那是什么意思 文艺基佬
What does that mean... Art Fag?

1107
01:17:57,210 --> 01:17:58,400
我的意思是 那是...
I mean, what is...?

1108
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:02,930
如果你从社会学的角度来看待这件事
If you would've think about it from more like a sociological perspective.

1109
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:05,360
那词是从哪来的 文艺基佬
Where does that come from? Art fag.

1110
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,680
- 那到底是什么      - 艾比知道它是什么
- What is that?        - Abbie understands it.

1111
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:10,930
艾比才不知道 她只不过是身在其中
Abbie does not understand it, she's just a part of it.

1112
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:19,260
{\an8}Black Flag- Nervous Breakdown?

1113
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:28,120
我们不必喜欢它
We don't need to like it.

1114
01:18:28,890 --> 01:18:30,460
好吧 他在说什么
Okay, what is he saying?

1115
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:34,770
把头靠在我肩上
Head on my shoulders...

1116
01:18:37,530 --> 01:18:40,040
- 狂怒起来      - 什么
- going berserk.        - What?

1117
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:43,030
- 这有意思吗      - 我不知道
- Is that interesting?        - I don't know.

1118
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:44,890
我也不知道
I don't know either.

1119
01:18:45,730 --> 01:18:47,670
我觉得我们可能想太多了
I think we're maybe over-thinking this.

1120
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:05,420
我们听听文艺基佬吧
Let's try the Art Fag one.

1121
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:09,580
文艺基佬来了
Here come the Art Fags.

1122
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:23,020
{\an8}Talking Heads - The Big Country?

1123
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:15,330
好的
Oh yeah.

1124
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:24,280
你觉得怎样
What do you think?

1125
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:37,990
就是这样
That's it.

1126
01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:44,160
我觉得我们是文艺基佬类型的
I guess we're more the art fag types.

1127
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:46,960
我喜欢
I like that.

1128
01:20:25,050 --> 01:20:27,110
过来 你这个深不可测的男孩
Come here, you inscrutable boy.

1129
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:34,170
我给他喝了啤酒
I gave him beer and then I...

1130
01:20:34,490 --> 01:20:37,580
然后教他用语言诱惑女人
taught him how to verbally seduce women.

1131
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:38,920
然后…
And...

1132
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:41,980
我们喝醉了开车 但我停下来了
we drove drunk, but I stopped that.

1133
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:46,850
然后他亲了翠西 然后我们走回家了
and then he kissed Trish… and then we walked home.

1134
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:58,370
你不生气吗
You're not mad?

1135
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:00,730
你生气了...
You are mad...

1136
01:21:07,770 --> 01:21:11,550
你能看到他在外面的世界为人的样子
You get to see him out in the world as a person.

1137
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:14,320
我永远看不到
I never will.

1138
01:21:22,190 --> 01:21:23,190
等等…
Just...

1139
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,840
看这个
There.

1140
01:22:04,890 --> 01:22:07,230
不敢相信艾比把这本书给了你
I can't believe Abbie gave you this book.

1141
01:22:08,910 --> 01:22:10,220
书很有趣
It's interesting.

1142
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:14,500
那是什么感觉
What's it like?

1143
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,380
- 对女孩儿来说...      - 什么
- For girls...        - What?

1144
01:22:18,190 --> 01:22:19,240
性?
Sex?

1145
01:22:21,890 --> 01:22:23,240
高潮
Orgasms.

1146
01:22:26,530 --> 01:22:28,490
你真想知道那是什么感觉
Do you really want to know what it's like?

1147
01:22:31,930 --> 01:22:33,090
对
Yeah.

1148
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:35,910
我没有过
I don't have them.

1149
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:39,440
什么
What?

1150
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,740
我朋友也没有过
None of my friends do.

1151
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:49,410
- 那你们为什么还做      - 因为别的原因
- So why do you do it?        - There's other reasons.

1152
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:52,700
你知道吗 比如他注视你的样子
You know, like the way that he looks at you...

1153
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:59,010
他们到某个点都会有一点渴求的样子
the way they all get a little desperate at some point.

1154
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:02,790
还有他们发出的小呻吟
And the little sounds that they make.

1155
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:18,340
还有他们的身体...
And their bodies...

1156
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:23,550
因为你无法确切地知道他们看起来会是什么样子
Cause you don't exactly know what they're gonna look like..

1157
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:27,890
闻起来也好 摸起来也罢
Or smell or feel like...

1158
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:31,820
你做了才知道
Until you do it.

1159
01:23:35,730 --> 01:23:36,920
但是啊…
But yeah...

1160
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:38,840
半数我都后悔了
Half the time I regret it.

1161
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,220
那你为什么还做
Then why do you do it?

1162
01:23:46,670 --> 01:23:48,600
因为还有一半我不后悔
Cause half the time I don't regret it.

1163
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:01,590
《活着和过时是痛苦的：衰老的女人》
　作者 佐伊・莫斯 1970年

1164
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:03,920
我很合群 对他人感兴趣
I am gregarious...interested in others.

1165
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:05,840
我也聪明
and I think intelligence…

1166
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:12,770
我想要的只是了解他人并且...
All I ask is to get to know people and...

1167
01:24:12,810 --> 01:24:14,510
让他们有兴趣了解我
to have them interested in knowing me.

1168
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:17,540
我不确定自己是否会再次结婚
I doubt whether I would marry again and...

1169
01:24:17,570 --> 01:24:19,690
去和另一个人如此近距离生活
live that close to another individual.

1170
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:21,980
但我总是受人忽视
But I remain invisible.

1171
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:25,570
当你看着我的时候 连一分钟都不要假装
Don't pretend for a minute, as you look at me

1172
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:28,330
以为我不如你一般鲜活
that I'm not as alive as you are.

1173
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:30,800
我也不要因为你给我强加的标签
and I do not suffer from the category...

1174
01:24:30,830 --> 01:24:32,310
而受罪
to which you are forcing me...

1175
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:39,950
我觉得脱光了之后 我比我前夫更迷人
I think stripped down I look more attractive than my ex-husband...

1176
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:44,150
但在生理上和社会上我都过时了
But I am sexually and socially obsolete.

1177
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:45,220
他却没有
And he is not.

1178
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:49,420
现在我有能力接受人们真实的样子
I have a capacity now for taking people as they are.

1179
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,220
这是我二十多岁时做不到的
which I lacked at twenty.

1180
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:54,060
我半数时间都能够达到高潮
I reach orgasm in half the time...

1181
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:56,130
我也知道如何取悦
and I know how to please...

1182
01:24:56,210 --> 01:24:57,750
然而我却不敢向一个男人表示
Yet I do not even dare show a man...

1183
01:24:57,780 --> 01:24:59,440
我觉得他有多迷人
that I find him attractive.

1184
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:03,490
如果我这么做了 他可能会觉得像是我冒犯了他一样
If I do so, he may react as if I had insulted him.

1185
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:08,340
我就应该履行好我的小职责
I am supposed to fulfill my small functions

1186
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:09,950
然后消失
and vanish.

1187
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:19,770
你是怎么看待这些东西的
What do you think of all that?

1188
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:24,440
我不知道
I don't know...

1189
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,280
或许我是个女权主义者
Maybe, I'm a feminist?

1190
01:25:32,180 --> 01:25:33,230
所以
So...

1191
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:39,800
你觉得这就是我
You think that's me...

1192
01:25:40,850 --> 01:25:42,310
不 我也不知道
No, I don't know.

1193
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:46,980
所以你觉得你看了这本书 你就更了解我了
So, you think you know me better because you read that.

1194
01:25:47,070 --> 01:25:48,380
不 不
No, no.

1195
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:53,880
那你为什么要念这个给我听
Then why're you reading it to me?

1196
01:25:58,350 --> 01:25:59,910
我觉得很有意思
I thought it was interesting.

1197
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:07,570
好吧
Okay, well...

1198
01:26:10,710 --> 01:26:13,620
我不需要通过一本书来了解我自己
I don't need a book to know about myself.

1199
01:26:21,610 --> 01:26:23,040
对不起
I'm sorry.

1200
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:42,950
我想说 很感谢你试着帮助他 真的
I mean, I appreciate that you trying to help, I do...

1201
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:45,410
但我觉得你有点太过了
I just think you are taking it too far.

1202
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:48,170
这种事情 你知道的...
And this stuff, with you know,

1203
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:51,260
女权运动我也很尊重 但是...
 the women's movement I respect, but it's just...

1204
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:54,570
这很复杂 我觉得这对他来说太过了
It's complicated, and I think it's too much for him.

1205
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:57,290
我不明白你指的是什么
I don't know what it is that you're talking about.

1206
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:59,150
好吧 他只是个十五岁的男孩
Okay, he is 15-year-old boy...

1207
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:01,900
- 我知道      - 你给他灌输的是实打实的女权主义思想
- I know...        - You are giving him hard core feminism...

1208
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:05,890
但是他确实热爱这个 而且真的...对他有所帮助
But he really loves it and it's really..it's helping him.

1209
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,300
- 帮助他什么      - 帮助他成为一个男人
- Helping him what?        - It's helping him become a man.

1210
01:27:08,330 --> 01:27:09,990
这就是你口中的那个男孩
This is the boy you were talking about.

1211
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:11,640
了解女性高潮…
Learning about a female orgasms...

1212
01:27:11,670 --> 01:27:12,900
能够帮助他成为一个男人?
is helping him be a man?

1213
01:27:12,930 --> 01:27:15,570
你认识有哪个男的在关心这些事吗
Well what man do you know that cares anything about that?

1214
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,620
- 这分明是奇迹了      - 他只是个高中生
- It's a miracle!        - He's a high school kid.

1215
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:19,290
好吗
Okay?

1216
01:27:19,290 --> 01:27:21,620
这太过了 我跟你这么说
It's too much, I'm telling you.

1217
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:27,870
我认为他似乎完全能够接受
I think he seems really okay with it.

1218
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:31,540
你知道你其实完全不明白自己在对他做什么吗
You know you don't actually know what you're doing with him?

1219
01:27:34,430 --> 01:27:35,950
好吗 那么…
Okay, so...

1220
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:38,590
你就...
Just...

1221
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:42,730
正如你们所知的
As you know...

1222
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:47,200
现在人们越来越不尊重政府
There is a growing disrespect for government...

1223
01:27:47,490 --> 01:27:49,950
学校 新闻媒体
The schools, the news media...

1224
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:51,220
以及各种机构
And all the institutions.

1225
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:56,610
这不是让人快乐和安心的信号
This is not a message of happiness or reassurance.

1226
01:27:57,460 --> 01:28:01,130
这是事实 也是警告
But it is the truth and it is a warning.

1227
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:07,250
这是一场信任危机
It is a crisis of confidence.

1228
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:07,300
吉米・卡特 信任危机演讲 1979年7月15日播出

1229
01:28:08,210 --> 01:28:11,290
我们能在日渐增长的
We can see this crisis in the growing doubt...

1230
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:12,360
对自己生活意义的怀疑中
about the meaning of our...

1231
01:28:12,380 --> 01:28:16,270
在民族团结和目标的缺失中
own lives and in the loss of unity and purpose...

1232
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:17,580
看到这场危机
for our nation.

1233
01:28:15,050 --> 01:28:22,010
电影《失衡生活》 导演 高佛雷・雷吉奥 
拍摄于1975-1979 上映于1982

1234
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:24,650
现在我们中的许多人都倾向于崇拜自我放纵
Too many of us now, tend to worship self indulgence...

1235
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:26,630
以及消费
and consumption.

1236
01:28:27,370 --> 01:28:33,140
但是我们也发现 占有和消费
But we've discovered that owning things and consuming things.

1237
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:38,620
并不能满足我们对于意义的渴望
does not satisfy...our longing for meaning.

1238
01:28:40,810 --> 01:28:46,570
我们一直相信我们是伟大运动的一份子
We always believed that we were part of a great movement.

1239
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:48,340
是人类自身的一份子
Of humanity itself...

1240
01:28:49,410 --> 01:28:52,310
以及对自由的追寻
Involved in the search for freedom.

1241
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:00,550
我们正处于历史的转折点
We are at a turning point in our history.

1242
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:06,710
这是一条走向分裂和自我利益的道路
The path that leads to fragmentation and self-interest...

1243
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:12,160
这条路上有着关于自由的错误观念
down that road lies a mistaken idea of freedom.

1244
01:29:14,830 --> 01:29:18,000
这条路必定会走向失败
It is a certain route to failure.

1245
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:22,890
谢谢你们 晚安
Thank you and good night.

1246
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:29,140
- 他完全搞砸了      - 可不是吗
- He is so screwed.        - No shit.

1247
01:29:29,690 --> 01:29:31,270
他完了
It's over for him.

1248
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:34,570
我觉得他讲得很漂亮
I thought that was beautiful.

1249
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:37,130
好吧
Well...

1250
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:39,410
为什么你不直接道歉
Why didn't you just say I'm sorry?

1251
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:40,440
不玩了
I'm done.

1252
01:29:40,830 --> 01:29:42,850
- 我的自尊心…      - 我明白
- My pride...        - I know.

1253
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:45,640
- 是啊      - 你看起来不像是很要强的人
- Yes...        - You don't seem like a prideful person.

1254
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:48,580
- 你看起来很谦虚      - 我今天没把自尊心带来
- You seem humble.       - I left my pride outside today.

1255
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:52,840
杰米 你能把艾比叫醒吗
Jamie, would you please wake up Abbie?

1256
01:29:55,370 --> 01:29:59,330
- 嘿 艾比      - 别动我 我在来月经
- Yeah Abbie.!        - Ugh, stop it, I'm menstruating.

1257
01:30:00,330 --> 01:30:03,670
艾比 你知道吗 你在来月经 可以
Abbie, you know what? You're menstruating, okay.

1258
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:06,230
但是你非要说出来吗
But do you have to say it, Ok?

1259
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:09,060
我们非得知道你的身体状况吗
Do we really need to know everything that's going on with you?

1260
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:13,440
什么 我在来月经 这有什么大不了的
What? I am menstruating. What is that a big deal?

1261
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,770
我们没必要知道 谢谢
We don't need to hear about that, thank you.

1262
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:20,130
如果你想和一个女人发生成人的关系
If you ever wanna have an adult relationship with a woman..

1263
01:30:20,330 --> 01:30:22,650
比如你想和她的阴道做爱
Like if you wanna have sex with a woman's vagina,

1264
01:30:22,730 --> 01:30:27,130
你得接受阴道会来月经这个事实
You need to be comfortable with the fact that the vagina menstruates

1265
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:28,220
我就会直接说月经
I'm just saying menstruation

1266
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:29,650
没什么说不得的
it's not a big problem.

1267
01:30:29,670 --> 01:30:32,830
所以 来吧 开始唱… 月经
So, start singing now... Menstruation.

1268
01:30:34,030 --> 01:30:36,740
- 不要      - 就要 月经
- No.        - Yes, menstruation.

1269
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:40,360
- 月经      - 杰米 不用
- Menstruation.        - Jamie, no...

1270
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:41,630
你没必要这样做
You don't have to.

1271
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:43,910
你的语气显得很害怕 别怕说这个词
You saying it like you're scared, don't say like you're scared...

1272
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:46,590
- 平常地说出来      - 月经
- Say it like it's normal.        - Menstruation.

1273
01:30:46,630 --> 01:30:47,910
- 月经      - 月经
- Menstruation.        - Menstruation...

1274
01:30:47,950 --> 01:30:48,720
还不赖
Not bad.

1275
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:51,200
朱利安 月经 你可以的
Julian, menstruation... You can say it.

1276
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,700
- 现在      - 我很遗憾
- Right now...        - I'm Sorry...

1277
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:55,780
月经
Menstruation.

1278
01:30:56,270 --> 01:30:57,940
你得...直视我的眼睛
It's just, keep eye contact with me.

1279
01:30:57,970 --> 01:30:59,880
你到底在看谁 月经
Who are you looking at? Menstruation.

1280
01:31:00,290 --> 01:31:01,980
- 月经      - 好的 对
- Menstruation.        - Yes that's right...

1281
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:04,580
月经 查理 你都不说话
Menstruation, Charlie? You're quiet...

1282
01:31:04,630 --> 01:31:06,960
- 月经?      - 月经?
- Menstruation?        - Menstruation?

1283
01:31:07,230 --> 01:31:09,480
不 不是疑问句 月经
No, not like a question, menstruation.

1284
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:11,500
月经
Menstruation.

1285
01:31:11,630 --> 01:31:13,570
现在大家一起说...
Now everybody say it together...

1286
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:15,090
月经
Menstruation

1287
01:31:15,090 --> 01:31:18,370
温柔地 开心地 但随意地说…
like gentle, happy...But casual and...

1288
01:31:18,570 --> 01:31:21,690
- 月经      - 恶心死了 艾比
- Menstruation!        - It's gross Abbie.

1289
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:24,590
不 不恶心 这是非常深沉的时刻
No, it's not. It's not gross. It's a very deep time.

1290
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:27,810
富有创造力和情感的塑造
Creatively and it's emotionally trans-formative.

1291
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:32,560
在经期做爱可以让人非常享受
And sex during menstruation can be very pleasurable...

1292
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:36,040
对女人来说 还能缓解部分阵痛
for a woman and can even like, relieve some of the cramps.

1293
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:37,320
杰米 我还想告诉你
Jamie I also wanna say...

1294
01:31:37,350 --> 01:31:39,540
永远不要只和阴道做爱
never have sex with just the vagina...

1295
01:31:39,570 --> 01:31:41,510
你得和这个女人做爱
You have to have sex with the whole woman.

1296
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:46,960
这个有点偏离了我在说的主题
That's slightly off topic of what I'm talking about.

1297
01:31:46,990 --> 01:31:47,990
但是谢谢
Thank you.

1298
01:31:48,310 --> 01:31:52,120
我第一次来潮的时候 我正在
The first time that I got my period, I was watching...

1299
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:55,290
和其他人一起看《飞越疯人院》
One that flew over the "Cuckoo's Nest", with some guy...

1300
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:59,590
然后我只说了句我得走了
And...yeah I just told him that I had to leave.

1301
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:03,400
接着我去了超市 买了一盒卫生棉条
So I went to the market and I bought a box of tampons.

1302
01:32:03,650 --> 01:32:06,390
我看了盒子上的说明书 然后塞了一根进去
I read the instructions on the box and I put one in.

1303
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:09,140
我从来没和妈妈讲过 她也从来不会问
And I never told my mom about it, but she never asks.

1304
01:32:09,170 --> 01:32:10,260
所以无所谓了
So it didn't matter.

1305
01:32:11,570 --> 01:32:14,390
我一直没看到《飞越疯人院》的结局
I never saw the end of the Cuckoo's Nest.

1306
01:32:16,930 --> 01:32:19,150
杰克・尼克尔森做了额叶切除手术
Jack Nicholson got a lobotomy...

1307
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:21,840
然后那个大个子印度人用枕头把他闷死了
and so the big Indian guy, smothered him with the pillow...

1308
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:23,630
为了让他能够自由
so that he could be, you know, be free.

1309
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:25,770
好吧… 咱们聊点别的
Okay... Let's talk about something else.

1310
01:32:25,810 --> 01:32:28,910
十四岁的时候 我第一次做爱
At 14, I had sex for the first time.

1311
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:29,940
朱莉
Julie!

1312
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:31,850
朱莉 拜托 甜心
Julie, please... you, honey...

1313
01:32:31,930 --> 01:32:35,040
有一天晚上 我决定要破处
I decided one night that I was just gonna loose my virginity.

1314
01:32:35,070 --> 01:32:37,630
- 我无所谓对方是谁      - 朱莉 你冷静一下
- I didn't care who.        - Julie, you gotta to calm down.

1315
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:38,800
别说话 让她讲
Stop it, let her talk.

1316
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,850
我在聚会里挑了一个我不认识的人
 I picked this guy that I didn't know at a party.

1317
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:44,920
我们做得相当痛苦 
And we had fairly painful sex.

1318
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:48,380
就在他停在路边的车里
In his van just parked on the street

1319
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:50,550
用口水来润滑
Just used spit for lubrication.

1320
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:52,310
恶心…
Disgusting...

1321
01:32:53,650 --> 01:32:55,700
不过我还是在宵禁前赶回了家
I made it home in time for the curfew though.

1322
01:32:55,740 --> 01:32:58,680
他的毯子闻起来像流出的下水道味儿
His carpet smelled like spilled bong water.

1323
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:07,650
好了 今晚就到此为止吧
Well, let's call it a night.

1324
01:33:07,850 --> 01:33:08,570
好的
All right.

1325
01:33:08,610 --> 01:33:11,150
谢谢你们来 表演结束了姑娘们
Thanks all for coming... show is over girls.

1326
01:33:12,210 --> 01:33:13,900
非常感谢你们来
Thank you so much for coming

1327
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:18,460
杰米 我们需要谈谈
Jamie, we need to talk.

1328
01:33:18,910 --> 01:33:23,030
发生了好多事 不是吗 我就…
There's a lot of stuff happening... right? And I just...

1329
01:33:23,150 --> 01:33:25,030
想知道你现在怎么样了吗
Would like to know what's going on with you.

1330
01:33:26,190 --> 01:33:26,960
我是说...
I mean...

1331
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,000
我知道对我们来说要处理的事情太多了
I know it's all been a lot for us to deal with.

1332
01:33:30,490 --> 01:33:31,420
妈妈
Mom.

1333
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:33,220
现在这些我都能处理
I'm dealing with everything right now.

1334
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:36,240
而你什么都没做
You are dealing with nothing.

1335
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:51,550
真不敢相信你把那些都说给大家听了
Can't believe you told everyone all that.

1336
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:54,790
我想说什么就说什么
I can say what I wanna say.

1337
01:33:57,010 --> 01:33:58,670
他们会认为你是个...
They're gonna think you're some...

1338
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:01,810
他们会对你产生错误的看法
They are gonna get the wrong idea about you.

1339
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:02,920
什么
What?

1340
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:04,730
认为我是个荡妇吗
That I'm a slut?

1341
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:08,700
你是这么认为的吗
Is that what you think?

1342
01:34:13,170 --> 01:34:15,670
你不可以再只是为了说说话
You can't sleep here anymore...

1343
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:17,960
睡在这里了
And just want to talk...

1344
01:34:22,050 --> 01:34:26,880
- 真的吗      - 是的
- really?        - Yes.

1345
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:32,260
杰米
Jamie...

1346
01:34:37,890 --> 01:34:39,140
对不起
I'm sorry.

1347
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,750
我对不起你 好吗
I am sorry, okay?

1348
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:53,520
我们一起走吧
Let's just get out of here.

1349
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:58,510
沿着海岸走 就像你说过的那样
Let's go up the coast... like you said that you would.

1350
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:02,370
就我们两个
Just the two of us.

1351
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:11,770
妈妈
Mom...

1352
01:35:12,930 --> 01:35:14,800
朱莉和我把车开走了
Julie and I took the car...

1353
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:18,530
我们要沿着海岸线去旅行
We're taking a trip up the coast...

1354
01:35:19,810 --> 01:35:21,370
离开这里
Just to get away.

1355
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:24,350
你不用担心我们
You don't need to worry about us.

1356
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:23,280
嘿
Hey...

1357
01:36:23,380 --> 01:36:27,700
你能帮我们买点果酒吗
Do you think that you could buy us some like wine coolers?

1358
01:36:27,850 --> 01:36:29,260
找零归你
You can keep the change,

1359
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:32,150
草莓的或者随便什么莓的都行
strawberry or anything berry really.

1360
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:44,870
- 嗨 怎么了      - 你好
- Hi, what's the matter?        - Hi...

1361
01:36:45,710 --> 01:36:47,810
你刚才在十字路口变换了车道
You changed lanes in the intersection back there.

1362
01:36:48,630 --> 01:36:50,190
当真 就因为这个?
Seriously, that's all?

1363
01:36:51,050 --> 01:36:53,320
请出示你的驾照
I need to see your license registration.

1364
01:36:54,070 --> 01:36:56,810
要是我没有驾照呢
What if I don't have my license?

1365
01:36:58,320 --> 01:36:59,020
好吧
Okay.

1366
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:01,620
你的名字 住址 出生日期是多少 这些总有吧
What's your name, address, and date of birth, do you have that?

1367
01:37:01,890 --> 01:37:05,960
你知道吗 这些是很私人的问题 我们才刚刚见面呢
You know, these are very personal questions and we've just met.

1368
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:09,470
你的名字叫什么 你的住址呢 是吧
What's your name? What's your address, right?

1369
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:11,970
我是说 这样有点太主动了
I mean... It's a little forward...

1370
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:41,040
我爱你
I love you...

1371
01:37:49,230 --> 01:37:50,500
你怎么了
What's wrong?

1372
01:37:51,390 --> 01:37:52,630
没什么
Nothing.

1373
01:37:57,540 --> 01:37:58,900
跟我说说
Tell me.

1374
01:38:04,970 --> 01:38:07,340
我觉得我和你靠得太近了
I think that I'm too close to you...

1375
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:10,160
近到无法和你做爱
To have sex with you...

1376
01:38:13,090 --> 01:38:14,760
有点复杂
It's confusing...

1377
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:18,230
对不起
Sorry.

1378
01:38:23,250 --> 01:38:26,470
我可以帮助你克服
I can help you get over that.

1379
01:38:30,010 --> 01:38:31,720
我不想克服
I don't wanna get over that.

1380
01:38:34,790 --> 01:38:36,040
不 你想
Yes you do.

1381
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:39,530
你这样就和别的男人一样
You're being like the other guys.

1382
01:38:39,950 --> 01:38:41,930
我想要的并不只是 和你做爱
I don't want to just, have sex with you,

1383
01:38:43,210 --> 01:38:44,320
我想要的是你
I want you...

1384
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:46,970
但那只是你以为的我
But it's your version of me.

1385
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:50,460
并不是真的我
It's not me.

1386
01:38:52,580 --> 01:38:55,170
你只是想要做爱的话 倒还好得多
It'd be a lot better if you just wanted sex

1387
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:58,540
你现在就和别的男人一模一样
You're exactly like the other guys...

1388
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:01,200
你只是看起来像现代主义者
You just seem like you are a modern.

1389
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:15,410
杰米?
Jamie?

1390
01:39:17,540 --> 01:39:18,560
杰米
Jamie.

1391
01:39:19,730 --> 01:39:20,800
杰米!
Jamie!

1392
01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:54,270
这些人一点幽默感都没有
These people have no sense of humor.

1393
01:40:13,330 --> 01:40:15,310
养一个孩子似乎是
Having a kid seems like...

1394
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:21,680
- 最难的事      - 是啊
- The hardest thing.        - Yeah...

1395
01:40:23,370 --> 01:40:25,230
你有多爱这个孩子
How much you love the kid...

1396
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:32,220
你就能把事情搞得多砸
you're just pretty much screwed.

1397
01:40:44,650 --> 01:40:46,250
- 给你做的      - 嗨
- It's for you.        - Hi.

1398
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:47,750
嘿
Hey.

1399
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:51,060
朱莉刚才打电话给我说他们在圣路易斯・奥比斯波市
Julie just called me, they are in San Luis Obispo,

1400
01:40:51,090 --> 01:40:52,420
她不知道他去哪了
she doesn't know where he is.

1401
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:53,700
她找不到他
She can't find him.

1402
01:40:54,980 --> 01:40:55,620
我...
I...

1403
01:40:55,740 --> 01:40:57,200
- 你能送我吗      - 可以
- Would you drive me?        - Yes, I will.

1404
01:40:57,240 --> 01:40:58,850
- 去那吗      - 这就走
- Out there?        - Yeah let's go..

1405
01:40:58,890 --> 01:41:00,460
- 你一起吗      - 一起
- Will you come?        - Yes.

1406
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:46,600
对不起
I'm sorry...

1407
01:41:51,530 --> 01:41:52,860
他回来了
He came back.

1408
01:41:54,270 --> 01:41:55,510
就在那边
He's right there.

1409
01:41:57,570 --> 01:41:59,870
好的 好的
Okay... Okay.

1410
01:42:04,070 --> 01:42:05,130
没事了
It's okay.

1411
01:42:28,530 --> 01:42:29,530
嗯
Well...

1412
01:42:30,230 --> 01:42:32,830
朱莉真是个很复杂的女人
Julie is... pretty complicated woman.

1413
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:34,890
要承受的太多了
It's a lot to take on.

1414
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:36,590
某种程度上 我还挺印象深刻
I'm impressed in a way.

1415
01:42:38,930 --> 01:42:39,990
管她呢
Whatever.

1416
01:42:50,730 --> 01:42:54,370
你不去找朱莉来吗 让她来找我说说话
Aren't you going to get Julie? To come talk with me?

1417
01:42:54,850 --> 01:42:57,120
- 杰米      - 怎么了
- Jamie?        - What?

1418
01:42:58,440 --> 01:42:59,850
我认为她们能帮你
I thought they'd help.

1419
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:04,120
看起来就像是你拿我没办法了
Well..It just seemed like you couldn't deal with me anymore.

1420
01:43:06,870 --> 01:43:07,870
听着
Look.

1421
01:43:08,940 --> 01:43:11,970
我想… 我...
I wanted... I...

1422
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:14,620
我...
Look, I...

1423
01:43:16,230 --> 01:43:18,910
我不想你走向和我一样的结局
I don't want you to end up in the same place as me.

1424
01:43:21,990 --> 01:43:23,340
这是什么意思
What does that mean?

1425
01:43:24,420 --> 01:43:26,520
我希望你能比我开心
Well, I wanted you to be happier.

1426
01:43:29,140 --> 01:43:32,650
而我不觉得这是我自己一个人可以办到
And I just didn't think I could do it by myself. I...

1427
01:43:36,390 --> 01:43:37,520
你可以办到
You're right.

1428
01:43:39,860 --> 01:43:42,490
我认为即便就我们俩 我们也可以很好
I thought we were fine though just me and you.

1429
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,130
真的吗
Yeah?

1430
01:43:52,870 --> 01:43:54,040
真的
Yeah.

1431
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:29,530

1434

再见
Bye.

1435
01:45:35,230 --> 01:45:36,870
再见 再见 再见
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

1436
01:45:47,470 --> 01:45:49,590
可能我们还不急着回去
So maybe we don't go back yet?

1437
01:45:52,590 --> 01:45:53,610
好啊
Okay.

1438
01:46:03,970 --> 01:46:07,700
- 你和爸爸相爱过吗      - 当然
- Were you and Dad ever in love?        - Sure.

1439
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:14,760
或者说
Or um...

1440
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:19,150
可能我只是
Maybe I was just...

1441
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:24,190
我只是认为应该是相爱的 或者...
I thought that was supposed to be in love. Or..

1442
01:46:24,770 --> 01:46:28,820
我害怕自己从来没爱过
I was scared I'd never be in love.

1443
01:46:31,130 --> 01:46:32,760
所以我...
So I...

1444
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:37,130
我那时选择了最好的解决办法
I just pick the best solution at the time.

1445
01:46:48,370 --> 01:46:51,870
- 我想漂染我的头发      - 孩子
- I want to bleach my hair.        - Kid...

1446
01:46:53,010 --> 01:46:55,480

- Really?        - Yeah.

1447
01:47:04,930 --> 01:47:05,940
好吧
Okay.

1448
01:47:11,090 --> 01:47:12,500
你孤单吗
Are you lonely?

1449
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:18,760
{\an8}亨弗莱・鲍嘉 电影《卡萨布兰卡》的男主角

我是这么想的
I'm thinking about it.

1453
01:47:23,290 --> 01:47:24,750
他都死了
He is dead.

1454
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:27,290
好吧

1455

我们在说下辈子 不是吗 所以...
This is my next life, right? So...

1456
01:47:32,690 --> 01:47:37,060
他可能活着 可能在那 我们可能会相遇
He may be there... may be around, and we might meet and..

1457
01:47:38,710 --> 01:47:40,580
可能在我们之间会发生点什么
something might happen between us.

1458
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:43,640
好吧
Okay..

1459
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:47,590
你就不能在现实世界拥有这些吗
You can't have it in the real world?

1460
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:51,160
现在可不是理性的时候 宝贝
Hey, this is no time to be rational, sweetie.

1462
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:56,380
好
Okay.

1463
01:47:57,640 --> 01:48:01,220
然后他了解我的想法
So he knows what I'm thinking

1464
01:48:01,220 --> 01:48:02,700
他能让我开怀大笑
And he makes me laugh...

1465
01:48:04,230 --> 01:48:06,970
而且 他能真正看到我
And... he really sees me.

1466
01:48:08,340 --> 01:48:12,450
而且 你知道他会说到做到的
And... You know that he's gonna do what he says he's gonna do.

1467
01:48:12,460 --> 01:48:16,950
- 就这么简单      - 听起来很棒
- So that's easy...        - It sounds nice.

1468
01:48:18,510 --> 01:48:19,580

是啊
Yeah...

我认为从此我和她开始了一段全新的关系
I thought that was just the beginning of a new relationship with her.

1471
01:48:33,050 --> 01:48:34,820
就在她真正向我倾诉的时刻开始
where she'd really tell me stuff.

1472
01:48:37,090 --> 01:48:39,420
但是也许再也不会有像这样的时候了
But maybe it was never really like that again.

1473
01:48:41,630 --> 01:48:42,770
也许就这样了
Maybe that was it.
