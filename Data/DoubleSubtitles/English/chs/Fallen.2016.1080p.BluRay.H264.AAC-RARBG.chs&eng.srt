140
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,268
你是来拿书的吗?
- Did you come for your books?- Mm-hmm.

00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,505
高中数学,英国文学,化学,宗教与历史

142
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,982
Oh,还少了一样
Oh, still missing one.

143
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,591
你介意吗? 它在 特别收藏区 那儿
Would you mind? It's in special collections.

144
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,662
好的
Sure.

145
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,662
很高兴见到你 露西
Ah, it's a pleasure to meet you, Luce.

146
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,142
谢谢
Thanks.

147
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,182
Hi.

148
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,426
嘿,等等
Hey, wait.

149
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,526
你掉了这个 (丹尼尔没说话 就走了)
You dropped this.

150
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,742
可恶
Shit!

151
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,826
你吓到我了
You scared me.

152
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,387
好吧
Alright.

153
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,865
你 这可怜的家伙
You poor thing.

154
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,661
天呀,你跌倒了吗?
- Jeez.- Oh, did you fall?

155
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,947
有受伤吗?
Are you hurt?

156
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,140
我很好.  不,你不好
- I'm fine.- No, you're not.

157
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,224
你从来没好过,你的存在 令人讨厌
You've never been less fine in your whole nauseating existence.

158
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,069
到这里 是一个 坏的选择
Coming here was a bad choice.

159
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,380
听着,如果我有令你不愉快,我向你道歉
Listen, if I did something to upset you, I'm sorry...

160
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,470
你让我恶心
You make me sick.

161
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,700
你什么都不是
You're nothing.

162
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,740
你眨眨睫毛,甩甩头发,期待世界 会停止运转吗?
You bat your lashes and flick your hair and expect the whole world to come to a stop.

163
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,020
你跟本不认识我
You don't even know me.

164
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,262
我知道 你是杀人的 小精神病
I know you're a murdering little psycho.

165
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,020
嘿,分开
Hey! Break it up!

166
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,248
精神病溅货! 你应该 贴着 你警告标签 来
Psycho bitch.You should come with a warning label.

167
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,660
还真快(你刚到学校)
That was quick.

168
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,620
是她 找你麻烦的,是吗?
- She...- Don't tell me she started it.

169
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,980
我想 应该是的
I'm sure she did.

170
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,142
但是 你可以不必走入 她的圈套
But that doesn't mean you have to take the bait.

171
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,626
你说的对, 我很抱歉
You're right. I'm sorry.

172
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,061
打架 可以被 开除
Fighting is grounds for expulsion.

173
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,583
对你而言 会被转到州立 精神病院
Which for you would mean a transfer to the state psych hospital.

174
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,311
那是 你想要的吗?
Is that what you want?

175
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:51,988
不是
No.

176
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,505
今天是你第一天到学校,我想你一定还没有 读到 管理条例
Since today is your first day and I'm guessing you've yet to read the code of conduct

177
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,504
我罚你打扫 庭院
I'll just give you yard duty.

178
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,621
你呢? 你跟我来
And you? You come with me.

179
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,231
你知道 没有允许 你不可以来这儿
You know you're not supposed to be in here without a pass.

180
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,660
我只是..
I just, ah...

181
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,947
Oh,不,不,不,开玩笑的
Oh, no, no, no, that was a joke.

182
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,701
我很抱歉
- Oh.- I'm sorry.

183
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,022
Oh,天呀
Oh, gosh.

184
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,827
不搞笑吗?
Oh. Not funny?

185
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,302
今天真是个很烂的第一天
It's just been a really rough first day.

186
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,191
是呀 ,欢迎来到 剑与十字 学院
Yeah. Welcome to Sword and Cross.

187
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,143
这个地方 令人发疯
- This place is...- Crazy.

188
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,310
我是Pennyweather Van Syckle-Lockwood.你可以叫我 Penn(佩恩)
I'm Pennyweather Van Syckle-Lockwood.You can call me Penn.

189
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:52,940
好的
Okay.

190
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,660
你是 Lucinda Price,但是每个人叫 你 Luce(露西)
And you are Lucinda Price,but everyone calls you Luce.

191
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,663
由 Dover 转学到这儿,高中成绩 GPA 4.2分
Transferred here from Dover with a 4.2.

192
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,707
令人钦佩
Impressive.

193
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,946
你怎么知道的?
How did you know that?

194
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,628
该死. 我像狗仔队吗
Shoot. Was that stalkery?

195
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,585
是的,有一点
A little bit, yeah.

196
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,700
抱歉
Sorry.

197
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,660
实际上,这里是一个很小 很小的学校.
See the thing is, this is a really small school. Like really, really small.

198
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,900
无限的小,这里发生的事不多
Like infinitesimally small,and not a lot happens here.

199
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,500
不像 Dover, 你是新来的女孩 既聪明又漂亮
It's not like Dover, and you're the new girl and you're smart and you're pretty

200
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,300
所以,我猜你会是 正负两方
so I'm guessing that you're going to be the centre of a lot of attention

201
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,064
注意的焦点
both positive and negative.

202
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,347
很好
Great.

203
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,507
告诉你吧
Tell you what.

204
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,100
我要走了,让你做你的事
I'm gonna go, let you do your thing

205
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,100
也许你想原谅我,你可以
and then maybe if you're feeling forgiving, you can...

206
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,860
忘记我在洗手间向你搭讪,给你太多的知讯
forget the whole me accosting you in the bathroom with too much information

207
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,060
而你只想清静一下,而我胡言乱语一堆
when you just want to be alone and then rambling on and on

208
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,180
因为 我也不知道如何 阻止我自己
because I don't know how to stop myself

209
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,981
说出刚发生的学校状况,请再给我一次机会 好吗?
from talking situation that's happening right now and give me another chance?

210
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,221
现在 我要走了
I'll go now.

211
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,384
- Hey, Penn? 嘿,佩恩
- Yeah?什么事

212
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,462
你可以告诉我 如何回到宿舍吗?我有点迷路了
Do you mind showing me back to the dorms? I'm a little bit lost.

213
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,702
当然可以
Sure.

214
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,387
谢谢
Thanks.

215
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,748
万一 现在真有天使 在我们之间 在地球上
What if angels actually walked among us right now, here on earth?

216
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,821
那就是 坠落天使 的故事
That's the story of The Fallen.

217
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,100
天使 被逐出天堂
Angels cast out of heaven

218
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,527
会被定罪 过着凡人的生活
condemned to live their lives alongside us mere mortals.

219
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,340
会被放逐,是因为他们 没有选边站
Banished, because they failed to pick a side

220
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,900
在大天使 Lucifer对抗天堂 的战争中
in Lucifer's war against Heaven.

221
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,866
谁可以告诉我,天堂发生怎样战争?
Who can tell me what the war in Heaven was about?

222
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,822
陶德
Todd?

223
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,511
善良对抗邪恶吗?
Good versus evil?

224
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,942
不是,你回答的太单纯了
No, that's too simplistic.

225
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,100
大天使 Lucifer是上帝最爱的天使
Lucifer was God's favourite.

226
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,925
是上帝最亮的光
His brightest light.

227
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,900
是什么事情,使他背叛上帝呢?
What caused him to turn from God?

228
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,900
有谁知道?
Anyone?

229
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,630
因为他的女朋友 甩了他
'Cause his girlfriend dumped him.

230
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,070
其他的天使 发生了什么事呢?
What happened to the other angels?

231
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,982
那些支持撒旦的 被放逐到地狱去
Those that sided with Satan were banished to Hell.

232
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,502
只有忠诚的天使 留在天堂
Only the faithful remained in heaven.

233
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,420
没有做出选择的天使,被放逐出天堂
The angels that didn't choose,they were cast out.

234
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,070
他们是 坠落天使
They are the Fallen.

235
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,344
被迫在人间 工作
Forced to walk the earth

236
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,220
有些坠落天使 仍保有 天使的本性
some of the Fallen retained their angelic nature

237
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,191
忏悔并等待机会 重新返回天堂
repented and wait for the chance to return to Heaven.

238
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,060
其他与 Lucifer结盟的天使
Others aligned themselves with Lucifer

239
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,711
过着 找寻欢乐,恶作剧与混乱 的日子
finding pleasure in mischief and chaos.

240
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,741
但是没有一个群组 可以离开这个世界
But neither group can leave this world

241
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,108
因为 他们之中的一个
because of one of their own.

242
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,629
叛逆天使(本片中的男主角 丹尼尔)
The rebel angel.

243
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,346
他拒绝选择 战争中两边的 任何一边
He rejected both sides of the war

244
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,540
上帝 与 Lucifer(大天使)一样
God and Lucifer alike

245
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,386
都在追求人类的 爱
all in his pursuit of human love.

246
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,220
其他的坠落天使
The other fallen angels

247
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,100
必须持续 待在人间
must remain here on earth

248
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:13,107
直到他(叛逆天使)选择 战争进行中的一边
until he chooses a side in the only war that has ever been waged.

249
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,705
这场战争至今还在 肆虐着 我们
The war we still see every day raging all around us.

250
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,831
这事,你们在 主日学 学过一些吧?
But surely you learned some of this in Sunday school?

251
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,183
没有,在我成长过程 不曾去过教会
No, I didn't go to church growing up.

252
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,222
真的吗?
Really?

253
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,909
是的,我父母没有宗教信仰
Yeah, my parents aren't really religious.

254
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,907
所以..你不曾受洗
So, you were never baptized?

255
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,570
是的 ,我没受洗
Um, no.

256
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,107
战争 是不是应该结束了呢?
Is it supposed to be over, the war?

257
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,260
我意思是,就神学观点来看
I mean, theologically speaking

258
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,820
如果恶魔还活着
if the Devil is still alive

259
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,900
还有谁能阻止他 再挑起战争呢?
What's to stop him trying from trying again?

260
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,823
非常好的问题
Excellent question.

261
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,988
So,还有谁要下注?
So, any more takers on that bet?

262
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,950
是的,让好戏继续滚下去,Roland.
- Yep. - Keep them rolling, Roland.

263
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,746
露西, 你这可怜的家伙
Luce, you poor thing.

264
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,226
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

265
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,746
这里发生了什么事?有人受伤吗?
What is going on here? Is anyone hurt?

266
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,705
没有,我真的没事
No, really, I'm fine.

267
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,945
这里的食物很好
The food is fine.

268
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,366
任何东西?   -任何东西,甜心
- Anything ? Anything, sweetheart.
-

269
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,103
那一定会是 你的橘子肉桂煎饼 加上生奶油 与香蕉
Definitely your orange cinnamon pancakes with whipped cream with bananas.

270
00:21:31,203 --> 00:21:33,042
- That sounds...听起来..
- Hey!  嘿

271
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,545
什么事奖这么久? 快点
What's taking so long? Come on.

272
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,987
我要用电话
I need it.

273
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,660
妈?妈?
Mom? Mom?

274
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,381
分配的时间到了.分配的时间到了
Allocated time completed. Allocated time completed.

275
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,831
我真不敢相信 我必须等一星期 才跟我父母 通电话
I just can't believe I have to wait a whole week to talk to them.

276
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,940
你知道吗 我连 说 再见 的机会都没有
You know, I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye.

277
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,143
你可以用 我周二的配给时间
You can have my time on Tuesday.

278
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,305
不. -可以的,我不会用到它
- No.- Yeah, I'm not gonna use it.

279
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,740
我已经待在这 6年了.每个我认识的人
I've been here six years.Everyone I know is here

280
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,346
以及 每个有兴趣与我聊天的人 就在这房间里
and everyone I'm interested in talking to is in this room.

281
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,020
那你父母亲呢?
What about your parents?

282
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,551
我不是故意要问
I've been meaning to ask.

283
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,464
(佩恩:) 我怎么会在这里?
How I ended up here?

284
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,111
你不必 告诉我.那没有什么 大不了的
You don't have to tell me.It's not a big deal.

285
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,664
好吧 我父母离婚后
Well, after my parents got divorced

286
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,140
他们俩个 都不要我,所以
neither of them really wanted me around so

287
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,621
他们决定 寄宿学校 会对我最有益
they decided that boarding school was in my best interest.

288
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,380
一旦我母亲看见那本 宣传小册子
And as soon as my Mom saw that brochure

289
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,464
上面有 孩子们骑马 与 游泳 等等
the one with the kids riding horses and swimming and stuff

290
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:41,267
就这样.找寻结束了.我就入学到这里
that was it. The search was over,I was enrolled and here I am.

291
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,140
所以,你不是有窃盗前科,躁郁症,厌食症自裁者.
So you're not a kleptomaniac,manic depressive, anorexic cutter?

292
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,381
不是
No.

293
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,340
我的诊断 比那些 更糟
My diagnosis is much worse

294
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,424
我想我是 无药可救了
and, I'm afraid, untreatable.

295
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,624
我有 TDP.
I have TDP.

296
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,866
心律不整 吗?
TDP?

297
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,749
悲剧地被父母丢弃
Tragically Disinterested Parents.

298
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,544
是的,我父母真烂
Yeah, my parents suck.

299
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,150
但是 这里有个池塘(很快乐,如鱼得水)
But there's a pool.

300
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,224
是呀.这里是很适合我
Yes,there is a pool.

301
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,389
你一定是在 开玩笑
You've gotta be kidding me.

302
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,030
我不敢相信
Don't tell me.

303
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,224
Cam 恋爱了?
Is Cam in love?

304
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,143
那会让你 把事情弄得更困难
That could make things difficult for you.

305
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,582
别忘了 你在替谁工作
Just don't forget who you work for.

306
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,705
丹尼尔
Daniel.

307
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,100
我昨天还没有机会 对你说声谢谢
I didn't get a chance to say thanks yesterday.

308
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,222
不必客气
Don't mention it.

309
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,389
总之 还是要谢谢你
Well, thank you anyway.

310
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,220
还有一件事 我有点尴尬要问你
There's one more thing I'm a little embarrassed to even ask but...

311
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,506
那就 不要问
Well, then don't.

312
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,220
但我 坚决要弄清楚它
Well, I've committed now.I'm just going to go for it.

313
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,268
你似乎 好眼熟
It's just you seem really familiar to me.

314
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,469
好像我在哪里 认识过你
Like I know you from somewhere.

315
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,305
有可能吗?不,不可能
- Is that possible?- No.

316
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,385
如果是,我会记得你
I'd remember you.

317
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,420
因为我仍然在想....
Because I keep thinking that...

318
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,468
我必须走了 再见
I've gotta go, alright? I'll see you later.

319
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,902
谢谢你
Thank you.

320
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,745
Hey,新来的女孩.前面几天,事故很多吧
Hey, new girl.Pretty eventful first few days.

321
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,540
已经计划好逃离 这儿了吗?
Already planning your escape?

322
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,588
是呀,正在考虑
Yeah, considering it.

323
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,101
要来点 早餐吗?
You ah, you want some breakfast?

324
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,140
的确 很诱人,但是,我上课快迟到了
That's tempting, but I'm actually running late to class.

325
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,949
迟到总比不到好
It's better never than late.

326
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,466
真好喝
This is really good.

327
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,061
这是 从哪里 弄来的
Where's it from?

328
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,461
我从 工厂休息室 偷来的
I stole it from the faculty lounge.

329
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,988
他们有一台 意式浓缩咖啡机
They have a pretty decent espresso machine.

330
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,225
你真是不可救药(习性难改)
You're incorrigible.

331
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,821
他们 都这样说我
That's what they tell me.

332
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,141
你不同意吗?
You don't agree?

333
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,586
我只知道 我喜欢什么
I just know what I like.

334
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,367
你不在意 会犯 校规吗?
And you don't mind breaking the rules to get it.

335
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,743
Well...

336
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,868
如果有奖励,冒险是值得的
if the risk is worth the reward

337
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,996
我认为 有何不可
I don't see why not.

338
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,780
你认为呢?
What about you?

339
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,466
你不会待在  剑与十字学院 就坚决遵守校规
You don't end up at Sword and Cross by following the rules.

340
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,985
你不觉得 你有一点叛逆吗 ?
You got a little rebel in you?

341
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,105
我只是被误解了(我不 叛逆)
I'm just misunderstood.

342
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,986
不,我看得出来
No, I see it.

343
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,221
你很漂亮(像天上星星一样闪亮)
You got a spark.

344
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,827
你的意思是什么?
What do you mean?

345
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,791
意思是.你是那种 宁愿做对的事,不愿做 被要求做 的人
Means you're the kind of person who'd rather do what's right than what you're told.

346
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,860
意思是 你是麻烦人物
It means you're trouble.

347
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,583
你认为 你了解我 哈?
You think you know me, huh?

348
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,705
我知道 我喜欢什么.
I know what I like.

349
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,907
时间到了
Time's up.

350
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,060
Roland 这星期五要举辨一个派对
Roland's having a party this Friday.

351
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,300
是非正式的
- Yeah?- It's just casual.

352
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,940
你可以带你的朋友来. 好的
- You can bring a friend.- Okay.

353
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,069
我们一伙人在周末都会聚在一起,舒缓一下压力
Bunch of us get together at the end of the week to blow off some steam.

354
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,262
谢谢
Thanks.

355
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,751
你不进来上课吗?
Aren't you in this class?

356
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,863
Oh,这课 我以前全都听过了
Oh, I've heard it all before.

357
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,584
准备 ,开始
En garde! Allez!

358
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,149
他们怎么也玩这个？
How well did they think this through?

359
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,940
你知道 提供武器给药物治疗中的青少年
You know, giving weapons to heavily medicated teenagers

360
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,988
来控制愤怒 是很危险的吗
with poor impulse control and anger issues.

361
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:34,988
停
Halt!

362
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,860
好了,更换 伙伴,巴克,你练习结束了
Alright, change partners. Sparks, you're up.

363
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,584
露西,让我们看看 你有没有注意 听课
Price, let's see if you've been paying attention.

364
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,831
有记住 我刚才的示范吗?
Remember what I showed you?

365
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,421
不全然记得
Not really.

366
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,941
准备
En garde!

367
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,062
开始
Allez!

368
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,980
不是很糟嘛
That wasn't terrible

369
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,183
对一个 第一次练剑的人来说
considering it was just your first time.

370
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,302
好了
Alright.

371
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,707
交换伙伴
Switch partners.

372
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,904
丹尼尔,到这边来
Grigori. Come on over.

373
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,222
准备
En garde!

374
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,168
开始
Allez!

375
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,500
非常好
Very good.

376
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,070
再来一次.准备
One more. En garde.

377
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,502
开始
Allez!

378
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,906
丹尼尔 停下来
Grigori, halt.

379
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,827
Halt!停下来

380
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,229
Halt!停下来

381
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,105
你们两个 停下来
Both of you, halt!

382
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,260
我给他一星期
I give it a week.

383
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,468
有关受洗的事?会影响她吗?
What about the whole baptism thing?Could that affect her?

384
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,900
细节无关
The details don't matter.

385
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:14,300
丹尼尔　每次都过度迷恋她 但结果都一样
Grigori always finds something to obsess over but it never makes a difference.

386
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,782
现在 你只要放松心情 就好,并 接受 露西的死亡
Now you all just need to relax and accept that Luce is gonna die

387
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,063
而且 你，丹尼尔或 Sophia老师 也都无法阻止
and there's nothing you or Daniel or Miss Sophia can do to stop it.

388
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,110
我以为 你从来没有 击剑过
I thought you'd never done this before?

389
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,381
我没有 学过
I haven't.

390
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,589
我身体 接管了一切
My body just took over.

391
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,940
好像 我确切地知道 我该怎么击剑
Like I knew exactly what to do.

392
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,742
Huh.

393
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,180
真诡异,你曾经 有这样的经历吗?
It was weird. Have you ever felt that?

394
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,706
有的,像似 我学 三角学的时候
Yeah, I was kinda like that with trigonometry.

395
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:38,060
开始,所有过程依序出现在我脑海, 我觉得我是天才
It all just fell into place so at first I was like 'wow, I'm a genius.'

396
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:42,304
后来 我才记得 我们去年就学过了,一点都不 令人讶异
But then I remembered that we covered it last year so I guess that's not as impressive.

397
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,350
你陷进去了(暗恋), 对吧
You got it bad, huh?

398
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,506
不,不是那样
No, it's not like that.

399
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,586
好吧, 也许是的
Well, maybe it is.

400
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,980
只是 我对 Daniel有这种感觉
It's just I have these feelings about Daniel.

401
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,391
好像 我认识他
Like I know him.

402
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,508
好像我认识他 很久很久了
Like I've known him for a really long time.

403
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,351
是呀, 也许你们一起上过幼稚园之类的
Yeah, maybe you guys went to preschool together or something.

404
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,140
我问过他 是否我们有见过,他说 没有
Well, I asked him if we'd met before and he said no

405
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,300
而且,基本上 他一直躲我 ,很奇怪
and he basically ran away. It was strange.

406
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,347
是吗
Yeah.

407
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,911
的确有点 不太对劲
Something definitely not quite right... hmm.

408
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,987
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

409
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,500
不要告诉任何人 我将告诉你的话,否则我会有很多麻烦 ,好吗?
I can get in a lot of trouble if you tell anybody what I'm about to say to you, okay?

410
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,502
我不会告诉任何人
I won't.

411
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,113
我自愿在 空闲时间待在办公室打工,虽然听起来很烂
So I volunteer in the office for my free period which I know sounds totally lame

412
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:26,469
但事实上很酷 很有趣,电脑有怪异的通路
but is actually kind of cool and fun in its own weird way, sort of.

413
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,660
结果 我发现 Randy 根本不会用电脑
Turns out Randy is totally useless when it comes to computers.

414
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,580
他竟然 问我最基本的电脑技能,诸如
So he asks yours truly to do the most basic tasks like

415
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:37,426
在他桌上电脑找档案,收寻打喷嚏刺猬之类的影片
find files on his desktop and search for videos of sneezing hedgehogs or whatever.

416
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,911
有趣的是
Meaning

417
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:44,384
我完全进入学校每个人的档案纪录
I have full access to everybody's academic records.

418
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,224
我看到 丹尼尔的档案
I've looked at Daniel's file.

419
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,391
完全是空的
It's empty.

420
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,660
他没有 住家地址,没有紧急连络人, 什么都没有
He's got no home address,no emergency contact, nothing.

421
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,026
这件好看吗?  - 好看
- Do you like this? - Yeah.

422
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,829
他和所有的那些孩子一样
It's the same with all those kids.

423
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,660
他们这群人 都有点怪怪的
There's just something not quite right about that whole group.

424
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,061
你 不曾听过他们谈论到他们的家庭 或是之前就读的学校
You never hear them talk about their families or their old schools.

425
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:06,620
他们很少去上课,但他们却像 以前就相互认识
They barely ever go to class and it's like they all knew each other from before.

426
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,820
等等,你是指 谁?
Wait, who do you mean?

427
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,940
丹尼尔先来
Daniel arrived first.

428
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,100
他去年初转学到这里,然后是Gabbe
He transferred at the beginning of last year and then Gabbe.

429
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,900
高高金发,常常与丹尼尔在一起的 那个女生吗?
The tall blonde that's always hanging around him?

430
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,540
是的 那个果糖甜度 85度 的女生
Yep, 85 percent confectionary sugar by volume.

431
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,860
然后是 Arriane
Then Arriane.

432
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,620
Oh,是的,我来的第一天,她带我参观学校
Oh, yeah, she showed me around my first day.

433
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,420
然后 Molly,"智障"的女生
And Molly. Serious defective.

434
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:25,020
然后是 Roland,我完全不知道 他是怎么通过 每周的小考
And Roland, I have literally no idea how he passes his weekly pee test

435
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,900
然后是 25岁的未来先生,Cam,他去年春天转学到这里
and then Mr. Future 25 Years to Life,Cam, transferred in last spring.

436
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,900
Sophia老师也是.
Miss Sophia, too.

437
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,109
她今年刚到,她不理会任何人 除了她最喜欢的事物
She's new this year and totally ignores everyone except her favourites.

438
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,630
这事你怎么看? 问倒我啦.
- Well, what do you make of it? - Beats me.

439
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,900
我真不敢相信. 什么事?
- I can't believe it. - What?

440
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,381
我要去参加一个Roland的派对
I'm actually going to one of Roland's parties.

441
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,904
oh,你们两个看起来 真可爱
Oh, don't you two look lovely?

442
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,427
谢谢
Thanks.

443
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,871
你也是, 一如往常
You do too. As always.

444
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,621
你看起来 好甜美
Aren't you sweet.

445
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,980
我有点讨厌她 是不是不对呀?
Is it wrong that I kind of hate her?

446
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,820
为什么,因为她完美无瑕,有蜂蜜的香味,阳光的肌肤,
Why, because she's a flawless,honey-scented, spray tanned,

447
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,700
傲美的身材,金发碧眼带着笑容
bikini waxed manicured blond-fembot who's always smiling

448
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,226
而且正在亲吻你暗恋的对象?
and is at this moment kissing your crush?

449
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,550
是的,几乎就是这样
Yeah, pretty much that.

450
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,426
你也许错了,但是 我完全可以理解
It might be wrong, but I totally get it.

451
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,665
有人要喝酒吗?
Anybody order drinks?

452
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,745
我想知道 你怎么会要来这派对
I'm still trying to figure out how you ended up here.

453
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,500
是你邀请我的,记得吗?
Well, you invited me, remember.

454
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,105
那不是我的意思
That's not what I meant.

455
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,208
显然是要加入我们,对吗?
With the rest of us it's obvious, right?

456
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,461
吸毒
Drugs.

457
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,981
恶意破坏
Vandalism.

458
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,381
沮丧
Depression.

459

花痴
Nymphomania.

460
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:58,026
为什么 你要来这样的地方呢?
So why did you end up at a place like this?

461
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,301
也许,我不是看起来那么纯洁
Maybe I'm not as innocent as I look.

462
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,829
- Hello.
- Hi.

463
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,184
那是 飞行莲花夹克 吗?
Is that a Flying Lotus jacket?

464
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,262
是的
Yeah.

465
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,948
你真是个 颓废派成员
You are such a hipster.

466
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,364
我意思是 好的那一方面(世面灵通的人)
In... in a good way, I mean.

467
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,663
我知道 你不是故意装酷 才穿的
Like you know,it's not like you're trying to be cool.

468
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,265
但是 你穿起来 的确很酷
Like you're actually cool.

469
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,148
Wow.

470
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,708
我这一生,被指控好多罪行.
I've been accused of a lot of things in my life

471
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,426
但从不装酷
but never that.

472
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,580
- Hey.嘿
- Oh, hey. Thank you.谢谢你

473
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,540
Oh,这是给我的吗?

好棒,还有饮料呀.谢谢,
Amazing. Thank you so much. Thank you.

不客气
Sure.

476
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,143
Um...

477
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,786
So...

478
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,780
这是表演会吗? 或是...
Is it from a show, or...?

479
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,460
是呀.很棒的现场秀.
Yeah. He's amazing live.

480
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,304
我看过他跟Teebs 在加州 艾西维尔市
I saw him in Asheville with Teebs.

481
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,220
少来.Teebs 是我最喜欢的 后迪拉 艺人
Get out of it. Teebs is my favourite post-Dilla artist.

482
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,540
雷猫科技 改变了我的生活
Well, Thundercat changed my life.

483
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,782
不,也许除了雷猫科技,还有别的
Well, no, except maybe for Thundercat.

484
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,789
你有听过 Daylight混音吗?
Have you heard the Daylight remix?

485
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,027
那个男低音
That bass.

486
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,827
完全正确
Exactly.

487
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,947
好也
Yes.

488
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,746
想到 不好的回忆吗?
Bad memories?

489
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,390
所以 你还在想念他?
So do you still think about him?

490
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,588
谁?
Who?

491
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,247
你杀掉的男孩,Trevor
The boy you killed. Trevor.

492
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,866
你知道的,高高的 有着迷人眼睛的 那个男孩.
You know, tall, easy on the eyes.

493
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,620
至少,他过去 常和你约会
Well, at least he was before he hooked up with you.

494
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,988
现在 你都忘光啦
Now he's not so much to look at.

495
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,666
你怎么会知道 他
How do you know about him?

496
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,301
我知道你很多事,疯子露西.  -离我远一点
- I know a lot about you, Crazy Luce.- Get that away from me.

497
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,143
我打赌 我知道的 比你自己 还多
I'll bet I know you better than you know yourself.

498
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,180
对不喜欢火的人来说,火 似乎特别喜欢你
For someone who doesn't like fire,it sure does seem to like you.

499
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,100
够了
That's enough!

500
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:10,140
闭嘴 Arrian,让我在你脸上留个疤痕来匹配你背上的疤
Shut up, Arri, let me give you a scar on your face to match the one on your back.

501
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,710
退下,Molly
Back off, Molly.

502
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,424
- Are you okay? 你还好吗?
- Yeah, I'm fine.我没事

503
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,820
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

504
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,020
我只是玩弄一下 你的神经病女友
Just having some fun with your psycho girlfriend.

505
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,829
给我离露西 远点
Stay away from Luce.

506
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,260
你听到了吗?
You hear me?

507
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,024
Oh,你忘记自己是谁啦.Cam
Oh, you've lost track, Cam.

508
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,111
你一直想要 你得不到的
You always want what you can't have.

509
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,704
这次,她是我的
This time she's mine.

510
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,866
放开我
Lay off me!

511
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,740
外太空 绝对有生物存在
There's definitely life in outer space!

512
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,260
嘿!露西 在哪里
Hey! Where's Luce?

513
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,502
我不知道,我以为 她跟你在一起
Um, I don't know.I thought that she was with you.

514
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,820
好吧
Okay.

515
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,620
她不需要你的帮忙.  -那么,谁来保护她呢? 你吗?
- She doesn't need your kind of help.- Who's gonna protect her, you?

516
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,022
放轻松点,你们这些多情鸟,这是派对时间
You know, you lovebirds need to relax, huh? It's a party.

517
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,100
我突然感觉很累
You know, I'm feeling pretty tired all of a sudden, actually.

518
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,340
我想我必须回去了
I think I'm just gonna go.

519
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,540
你要我陪你走回去吗?
You want me to walk with you?

520
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,190
不,没关系,你留在这 好了
No, it's okay. You should stay.

521
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,867
Hello?

522
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:45,982
Molly.

523
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,829
Molly,拜托.我知道是你
Molly, come on. I know it's you.

524
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,101
Trevor 在哪里?
Where's Trevor?

525
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,501
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

526
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,147
我很抱歉.  -你做了什么,你这个 怪胎
- I'm so sorry. - What did you do, you freak!

527
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,427
都是我的错
It's my fault.

528
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,706
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

529
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,867
告诉我,在剑与十字学院 ,第一个星期 过得如何?
So tell me, how was your first week at Sword and Cross?

530
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,162
很好
Fine.

531
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,224
没有事件要报告?
No incidents to report?

532
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,548
幻觉,恶梦 呢?
Visions? Nightmares?

533
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,662
没有
No.

534
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,191
你的影子幽魂呢?
What about your shadows?

535
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,708
很好
Good.

536
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,729
很好
Good.

537
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,963
很好
Good.

538
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,667
怎么了?
What's wrong?

539
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,547
没事.
Nothing.

540
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:53,503
我只是无法 置之不理.   -什么?
- I just can't get past it.- What?

541
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,269
我觉得 我认识你
This feeling that I know you.

542
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,631
我们不是以前 谈论过这事了吗?
Haven't we been through this?

543
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,462
是的,但是
Yeah, but...

544
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,271
我不相信你
I don't believe you.

545
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,549
你我之间有关连
There is something between us.

546
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,904
而且 你也感觉到了,对吗?
And you feel it too, don't you?

547
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,745
好吧
Alright. Okay.

548
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,608
你是对的, 我应该告诉你实话
You're right.I should have just told you the truth.

549
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,106
It's...

550
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,540
我了解 我曾经对你很热情,而且...
Like I realise I haven't been very warm towards you, and...

551
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,985
你真是个 浑球
You've been a real dick.

552
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:32,291
是的,但请相信我,不是因为 你曾经做过什么事
Yeah, but believe me. You've got to know it's not because of anything you've done.

553
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,580
有个女孩...
See, there's this girl...

554
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,661
Gabbe 吗?
Gabbe?

555
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,070
什么? 不是
What? No.

556
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:40,821
不是 Gabbe,是另外一个女孩
No, not Gabbe. No, just someone else. Another girl.

557
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:44,411
我猜 你会说我不再跟她一起,但是
I guess you could say I'm not with her anymore, but

558
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,941
我还 爱着她
I still love her.

559
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,700
我想说的是 ...
What I'm trying to say is...

560
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:52,560
你是一个烂摊子,我最好离你远一点?
You're a mess and I'm better off without you?

561
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,431
似乎就是这样
Something like that.

562
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,986
事情没那么简单
It's not that simple.

563
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,143
你大可以说出你的感受
You can't tell someone how to feel.

564
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,582
是的
Yeah.

565
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,590
我希望 事情发展不是这样
I wish things could be different.

566
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,591
嘿.不要走
Hey! Don't go.

567
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,820
原来你在这里.我正担心你呢
There you are. I was worried about you.

568
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,028
你离开派对 忘了说再见
You left the party without saying goodbye.

569
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:43,902
发生了什么事??
What's wrong?

570
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,310
露西 停下来 跟我说话
Luce? Stop! Talk to me!

571
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,140
我与 Molly 有一段有趣的对话 昨晚
I had an interesting conversation with Molly last night.

572
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:53,030
OK. -她知道我的事
- Okay. - She knew things about me.

573
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,140
这些事 我从来没与他人分享过.  -然后呢
- Things I haven't shared with anyone.- And...

574
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,188
有人把事情告诉了她
Someone's been talking to her.

575
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,000
这个人看过我的档案
Someone who's read my file.

576
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,540
Oh.对的,你的怀疑 很有道理
Oh, right, 'cause that makes perfect sense.

577
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,820
我背叛了你的信任 成为一个无情的,没灵魂,又缺乏想像力的霸凌者
I betrayed your trust to a ruthless,soulless, unimaginative bully

578
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,790
与不卫生 和很烂的说话技巧 的Molly交换,为的是什么?
with suspect hygiene and poor language skills in exchange for what?

579
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,260
为了两个身体穿洞(耳洞)与囚犯刺青吗?
Oh, two free body piercings and a prison tattoo.

580
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:16,389
我相信我能侥幸成功 但你抓到我了
I was sure I'd get away with it,but you caught me.

581
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:20,384
好吧,至少 你已长大 足以承认这事
Well, at least you're big enough to admit it.

582
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:23,823
到底是怎么了? 说真的.
What's wrong? Really.

583
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,540
你有看过我的档案,对吗
You have read my file, haven't you?

584
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:28,701
当然
Of course.

585
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,586
所以你知道有关...
So then you know about...

586
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,271
影子幽魂 的事?
the shadows?

587
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,102
你还有看到 它们吗?是的
- Do you still see them?- Yeah.

588
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,420
你 现在 有看到吗?
Do you see them right now?

589
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,902
没有,但是 自从我来到这里,我的幻觉 变得更糟了
No. But since I've been here they've gotten a lot worse.

590
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:45,860
我很害怕,我怕有人会受到伤害
And I'm scared. I'm scared somebody's going to get hurt.

591
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,427
不,别傻了   -我没有
- No, don't be ridiculous.- I'm not.

592
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,264
死去的 Trevor 当时就站在那里
Trevor was just standing there.

593
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:57,780
他就站在那里 而且我们..  -好吧,详细地告诉我 发生了什么事
- He was just standing there and we...- Okay. Tell me exactly what happened.

594
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,820
Trevor 举止像似 我整年不在
Trevor acted like I didn't exist all year

595
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,260
然后 突然在派对上对我调情
and then suddenly at this party he was flirting with me.

596
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:04,024
来吧 跟我去 小屋里
Come up to the cabin with me.

597
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,547
正当我要感到
Just one time I wanted to feel

598
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,546
正常(亲热)
normal.

599
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,182
你要喝点酒吗?  -好呀
- You want a drink? - Sure.

600
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,467
你有听到吗?
Did you hear that?

601
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,669
Trevor 你确定 只有我们吗?
Trevor, are you sure that we're alone?

602
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:31,942
露西
Luce.

603
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,067
放轻松
Relax.

604
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:52,302
不
No.

605
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,110
停.停.离开,离开
Stop. Stop. Get off. Get off!

606
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,420
倒底是 怎么了? -请离开这里
- What the hell? - Please, get out of here.

607
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,467
发生什么 事?
What's going on?

608
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,267
不.不!
No. No!

609
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:01,867
露西?
Luce?

610
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,910
影子幽魂 比过去 更大
The shadows were bigger than ever.

611
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,300
然后, 突然 所有的东西都付之一炬
And then suddenly everything exploded.

612
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:12,460
我不知道我是怎么逃到外面的 而 Trevor 没有逃出来
And I don't know how but I was outside and Trevor didn't make it.

613
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,382
Trevor!

614
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,223
Trevor 在哪里? 告诉我
Where's Trevor? Tell me.

615
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,101
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

616
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:34,781
我很抱歉.   -你做了什么,你这个 怪胎
- I'm so sorry.- What did you do, you freak?

617
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:37,227
那是我的错. 我很抱歉
It's my fault. I'm so sorry.

618
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:38,827
Trevor!

619
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:42,886
他死了 因为我有问题(精神问题)
And he's dead because there's something wrong with me.

620
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,100
我很高兴你愿意做我的朋友
And I'm really glad you want to be my friend

621
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:48,502
但是 你应该远离我 因为我很危险
but you should stay away from me because I'm dangerous.

622
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:50,984
你想要 他死吗?
Did you want him to die?

623
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,345
不想,你想伤害他吗?
- No.- Did you try to hurt him?

624
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:00,227
不想 -那么,那不是你的错
- No.- Well, then it's not your fault.

625
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:04,389
你不必孤单一人,你需要一个朋友
You don't need to be alone, Luce.You need a friend.

626
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,065
让我来帮助你
Let me help you.

627
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,467
为什么?
Why?

628
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,023
因为 那就是朋友 该做的事
Because that's what friends do.

629
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:31,107
上次 我们讨论到 因为大天使Lucifer的自大 让他坠落
Last time we were discussing how it was Lucifer's pride that led to the fall.

630
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:33,668
是的
Yes.

631
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,264
因此 谁可以翻译一下?
So who can translate?

632
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,101
Humilitas homines sanctis[拉丁文.]

633
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,066
angelis similes facit[拉丁文.]

634
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:46,464
et superbia ex angelis demones facit.[拉丁文.]

635
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,741
有人 能翻译它 吗?
Anyone?

636
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:52,100
自大让天使变成魔鬼
It was pride that turned angels into devils.

637
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,909
那是什么,露西?
What was that, Luce?

638
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,060
谦卑使人变成天使
It is humility that makes men as angels.

639
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,461
自大让天使变成魔鬼
It was pride that turned angels into devils.

640
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,466
我们有 拉丁文学者 在我们当中
We have a Latin scholar in our midst.

641
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:08,031
不, 我不曾
No, I've never...

642
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:10,791
我只是猜的
It was just a guess.

643
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:18,624
那么 这与 叛逆天使(本片中的 丹尼尔) 有什么关系呢?
So how does that relate to the rebel angel?

644
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:23,300
是因为 他的的自大,固执地追求 爱情 超过上帝
Wasn't it his pride, his stubborn pursuit of love over God

645
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:26,145
让他成为坠落天使 陷在人间吗?
that led to the Fallen being trapped on earth?

646
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:27,941
Arriane?

647
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:33,180
我已经厌倦去听 你扭曲这个宗教寓言 用以套在你自己的信仰上
I'm tired of listening to you twist these religious fables to fit your own beliefs.

648
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:36,264
你说过这个故事 , 爱情是选择的关键
You tell this story of yours as is love was a choice.

649
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,304
我不喜欢你说话的语气
I don't care for your tone.

650
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:43,500
也许你只是生气  叛逆天使选错了 女孩
Maybe you're just pissed the rebel angel chose the wrong girl.

651
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:44,860
出去
Get out.

652
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,430
我很乐意
Gladly.

653
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:49,500
我宁愿在地狱永远地被火烧烤
I'd rather burn in hell for all eternity

654
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:54,268
也不愿意再花一秒钟 听你一大堆胡说八道
than have to listen to one more second of your pious self-satisfied ravings.

655
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:01,620
刚才 真精彩
That was kind of awesome.

656
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:04,100
是呀.你想 她会被留级吗?
Yeah. Do you think she'll get suspended?

657
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:08,189
我猜 即使她被留级 .那些孩子一点也不会在乎
I doubt she even gets detention.Those kids get away with everything.

658
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,220
嘿.我忘了我的毛衣. 我待会儿赶上来
Hey, I forgot my sweater.I'll catch up with you guys.

659
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,387
好的
Okay.

660
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:18,024
听我说 你一定要注意 Cam
Listen to me. You've got to keep your eye on Cam.

661
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,700
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

662
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:23,500
我不认为雕像倒下是一个意外事件.她(露西)正处于危险中
I don't believe the statue was an accident. She's in danger.

663
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:26,026
就在意外发生前,我看见他(Cam)在顶楼
I saw him on the upper floor just before it happened.

664
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,380
他为何要那么做?
Why would he do that?

665
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,420
你也听到了.露西还没有受洗
You heard. She isn't baptized.

666
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,389
露西 需要我们的保护，她...
She needs our protection. She's...

667
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:37,022
抱歉, 我只是忘了我的毛衣
Sorry, I just... I forgot my sweater.

668
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,625
我去跟她说
I'll go talk to her.

669
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:19,541
嘿.露西
Hey, Luce!

670
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,108
等等
Wait.

671
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,860
什么事? 你要干嘛? -没事
- What? What do you want? - Nothing.

672
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:27,308
我想也许 我们可以一起走走,散散步
I just thought maybe we could walk together.

673
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:28,308
Oh.

674
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:30,706
当然可以
Sure.

675
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,628
你今天 在教室 画什么呀?
What were you working on in class today?

676
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,225
没什么, 是一个...
Nothing. It's ah...

677
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,142
一种 绘画本小说
sort of a graphic novel.

678
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,140
是什么样的故事呢?
What kind of story?

679
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,389
我想,你可以称它 是一个浪漫爱情故事
I guess you could call it a romance.

680
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,460
故事有个 快乐的结局吗?  -我不知道
- Does it have a happy ending?- I don't know.

681
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:53,544
你不知道 故事的结局?  -不,还不知道
- You don't know how it ends? - No, not yet.

682
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,745
老实说,我有点卡住了
I'm sort of stuck, to be honest.

683
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:01,180
让我听听 告诉我你写的故事
Well, let's hear it. Tell me your story.

684
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,342
不.我不认为 那是个好主意
No. No, I don't think that's a good idea.

685
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:04,622
不好吗?
No?

686
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:08,509
也许,我可以帮你 完成故事的结局
Maybe I could help you with the ending.

687
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:13,827
好吧
Okay.

688
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:17,164
故事是有关一个男孩和女孩
It's about this boy and this girl

689
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,723
他们彼此非常相爱
and they love each other more than anything

690
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,784
但是, 他们绝对不可以在一起
but they can never be together.

691
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,870
为什么? -因为有一个诅咒
- Why? - Because there's this curse.

692
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,708
每17年他们相遇
Every seventeen years they meet

693
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,785
而且 开始相恋
and they fall in love

694
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:37,427
正当他们最幸福快乐的时候,那女孩就会死掉
and then just when they're happiest, the girl dies.

695
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,466
所以,故事是个 悲剧?
So it's a tragedy?

696
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:48,070
那男孩 怎么办呢?
What happens to the boy?

697
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,941
他等待
He waits.

698
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:55,243
他不会变老 也不会改变 面貌
He doesn't age or change.

699
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,190
他继续谈恋爱
He remains in love.

700
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,841
多年过后 最终 女孩又再回来
Years pass, and eventually she returns.

701
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,101
同一个女孩吗?
The same girl?

702
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,466
女孩 变了
She's changed.

703
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,028
她有新的名子,新的家人
She has a new name, new family.

704
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,905
她不记得他
She has no memory of him

705
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,910
但是他知道 她就是那个女孩
but he knows it's her.

706
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,807
是她的灵魂
It's her soul

707
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:20,386
转世再生
reincarnated.

708
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:23,469
然后 他们又再相恋一次
And they fall in love.

709
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,707
一直都是这样
Always.

710
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:33,749
我意思是,每一次转世有一点点不一样
I mean, each time it's slightly different.

711
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,883
虽然有无限次的轮回与相逢, 最后结果都一样(女孩会死)
There are infinite versions but the end is always the same.

712
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,528
但是,结尾 都是一个 亲吻
But then all it takes is a kiss

713
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:43,305
然后 女孩就死了
and she's gone.

714
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:46,705
是谁下的诅咒 在他们身上的呢?
Who put the curse on them?

715
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,904
是魔鬼 他本人
It was the devil himself.

716
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:53,561
他忌妒他们的爱情,因此 他想拆散他们
He was jealous of their love,so he tried to break it.

717
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,821
一定有 他们能解决的方法,对吗?
There has to be something they can do, right?

718
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,545
他全都试过了
He's tried everything.

719
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,466
他试着 找她
He tries looking for her

720
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:05,230
试着 躲避 她
then tries to avoid her.

721
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,426
试着逃离 无法避免的 心碎
Tries to run away from the inevitable heartbreak.

722
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:11,391
但是诅咒 总是赢家
But the curse always finds a way,no matter what.

723
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,710
故事中的女孩
The girl in your story.

724
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,501
她就是你 在游泳池提到的 那一个吗?
Is she the one you mentioned at the pool?

725
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,805
他还爱着她 的那个女孩?
The girl you're still in love with?

726
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:23,428
她 是故事的灵感来源,是的.
She's the inspiration, yeah.

727
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,226
是这个女孩吗?
This girl?

728
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,224
好吧 你逮到我了. 那是
Alright, you got me. It's um...

729
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:35,147
我用你做为 故事中女孩的化身
I was using you for her current incarnation.

730
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:38,144
这背景应该是在 巴黎
This is meant to be Paris.

731
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:41,060
1723年
In 1723.

732
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,630
这想法 真笨
It's stupid.

733
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,501
为什么 是我?
Why me?

734
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:47,505
因为你很漂亮
Because you're beautiful.

735
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,424
但是 我画错 眼睛了
But I messed up the eyes.

736
00:53:57,020 --> 00:54:01,341
在你的眼睛里 总是有点神秘
There's always been something about your eyes.

737
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:14,781
怎么了?
What's wrong?

738
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,147
没事
Nothing.

739
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,867
告诉我这个地方.你曾经待过那里吗?
Tell me about this place.Have you been there before?

740
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,267
那有关系吗?
Does it matter?

741
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,191
- Yes.是的.
- Why?为什么?

742
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,108
过去 我从来没有旅行过
I've never travelled before.

743
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,382
我甚至 不曾离开过这个国家
I've never even left the country.

744
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,620
但我知道 有一家咖啡店 就在画中右上方
But I know that there's a cafe just off to the right

745
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:37,260
而且我也知道 下雨过后 那里闻起来 像是茉莉花香
and I know it smells like jasmine after it rains.

746
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:41,580
我也知道 经营那家咖啡馆的老人,总是饥饿不饱,而且对她太太很残暴无情
And I know that the old man that runs the cafe is kind to his dog and he's cruel to his wife

747
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:45,140
我知道这些事情,因为我过去,曾经在那里待过
and I know these things because I've been there.

748
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,064
而且是 我跟你一起在那里
And I've been there with you.

749
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:50,750
哦,露西  拜托
Oh, Luce, come on.

750
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,067
不要
Don't.

751
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,023
不要告诉我 我疯了
Don't tell me that I'm crazy.

752
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:57,220
露西,那只是一张画,好吗?
Luce, it's a drawing, alright?

753
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,143
它只是一个故事,就这样
It's a story, that's all.

754
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,501
你在说谎
You're lying.

755
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,427
我希望我能告诉你 你想要听的
I wish I could tell you what you want to hear.

756
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:11,701
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

757
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:40,907
吹蜡烛
Blow.

758
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,111
生日快乐,露西
Happy birthday, Luce.

759
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,061
你怎么知道 我生日?
How'd you know?

760
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:50,991
你要 许个愿望吗?
Did you make a wish?

761
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,460
我不能告诉你 否则愿望不会实现
I can't tell you. It won't come true.

762
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,190
Oh,那没关系
Oh, that's okay.

763
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,384
我已经知道 你的愿望是什么
I already know what you wished for.

764
00:55:58,540 --> 00:55:59,582
是吗?
Oh, yeah?

765
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,986
我的愿望是什么?
What'd I wish for?

766
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:03,107
是答案
Answers.

767
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:05,391
你想要真相
You want the truth.

768
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,506
晚上8点在 拱门见,我将告诉你 所有的事情
Meet me at the arches at eight and I'll tell you everything.

769
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:12,702
露西
And Luce?

770
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:15,431
穿漂亮一点
Wear something nice.

771
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:17,805
晚上是 派对时间
It's party time.

772
00:56:44,805 --> 00:56:47,805
17岁生日快乐,妈妈 和 爸爸
Happy 17th Love Mom and Dad

773
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:02,901
看看你
Look at you.

774
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:04,822
Oh, wow.

775
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:07,507
那是你吗?
Is it yours?

776
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:08,947
为了今晚
For tonight.

777
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:11,665
这机车 你怎么弄到的?
How'd you manage that?

778
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:14,220
那是Rolland的特殊才华
It's Roland's special talent.

779
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,621
他能替你 弄到任何你想要的东西
Anything you want, he can get it for you.

780
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,950
我会感到遗憾吗?
Am I going to regret this?

781
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,263
只有一个方法可以知道
There's only one way to find out.

782
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,180
上车.-门都没有,我来骑车
- Come on.- No way, I drive.

783
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:30,991
你真的要 今晚一开始 就被一个女孩拒绝吗
You really want to start the night by saying no to the girl?

784
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:33,308
好吧
Okay.

785
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:19,270
我跟你在这里做什么呢?
What am I doing here with you?

786
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:20,747
庆祝
Celebrating.

787
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:22,067
这点 你很在行
You're good at that.

788
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:23,980
每次我问你问题
Every time I ask you a question

789
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:26,540
你都有 很机灵的方法 来 躲开回答
you have some clever way of avoiding the answer.

790
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,100
才不是这样
That's not true.

791
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,901
举例来说..你在哪里长大的呢?
Here's an example. Where did you grow up?

792
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,260
看吧?
See?

793
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:38,740
你为什么不告诉我 任何有关你的事呢
How come you won't tell me anything about yourself?

794
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:41,551
因为 我正在享受美好时光 ,我不想毁坏它
Because I'm having a nice time and I don't want to ruin it.

795
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:44,190
毁坏美好时光 不好,huh
It's that bad, huh?

796
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,141
我比较喜欢 这个
I prefer this.

797
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,190
你承诺要告诉我 答案
You promised answers.

798
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,942
来吧, 露西. 今天是你的生日
Come on, Luce. It's your birthday.

799
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:00,547
我想 有些其他的东西 是你想要的
I'm thinking there's something else you might want.

800
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:19,906
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

801
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,060
停止!我告诉过你 离她远一点
- Stop!- I told you to stay away from her.

802
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:23,060
丹尼尔,你在做什么?
Daniel, what are you doing?

803
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,940
为什么? 因为你很在乎她吗? -停下来
- Why, because you care so much about her?- Stop it!

804
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,220
不要吵了.  -不,因为我知道你想干什么
- Stop!- No, because I know what you're capable of.

805
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:29,180
你仍然与 Lucifer在一起,承认吧
You're still with Lucifer. Admit it!

806
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:31,460
为什么你不告诉她,丹尼尔?告诉她所有的事
Why don't you tell her, Daniel?Tell her everything.

807
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:32,420
她要知道真相.  -不要吵了 你们两个
- She wants the truth.- Stop it!

808
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:35,065
给我离她 远点,  -你没有权利 把事情说出来
- Just stay away from her!- You don't have a say in it.

809
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:39,185
我不知道 这是怎么回事,但是 它全都与我无关
I don't know what's going on here but it has nothing to do with me.

810
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:56,180
我从不相信 我命中注定要与某个人在一起
I never bought into that idea that there's one person you're meant to be with

811
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:00,663
但是 我的幻象是如此的真实 而且 我的感觉是如此真实
but my visions are so real and my feelings are so real

812
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:05,181
它像是 前世今生之类的,我也不知道为什么
it's like past lives or something.I don't know.

813
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:09,146
然而 每件事都与 丹尼尔有关,但他总是把我推开
And everything's connected to Daniel somehow but he keeps pushing me away.

814
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:11,462
而且 Cam 也隐瞒了些事情
And Cam's hiding something too.

815
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:12,740
你认为呢? 佩恩
So what do you think?

816
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:14,860
我认为你是个 浑球 没有告诉我 那天是你的生日
I think you're a jerk for not telling me it was your birthday

817
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:18,962
但是我宁愿忽视它 因为它太荒谬 可笑了
but I'm willing to overlook that because this is so ridiculously juicy.

818
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:21,510
你相信 转世 轮回 再生 吗?
Do you believe in reincarnation?

819
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:23,904
不,一点都不相信
No. Not at all.

820
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:25,950
我也不相信 ,但是
I didn't think so either but

821
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:29,586
这些事件,一定有个解释
there has to be some sort of explanation for this.

822
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:31,187
Hmm.

823
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:33,947
也许我能帮助你
Maybe I can help.

824
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,140
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

825
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,264
我们只需要再多做一件事
We just need one more thing.

826
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:49,142
什么?
What?

827
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:58,741
你怎么知道 那是 Todd 的房间?
How do you know which room Todd's in?

828
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:04,140
它是怎么 工作的??
So how does this work exactly?

829
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:05,580
你有看过年刊相片吗?
Have you got those yearbook photos?

830
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:08,982
Todd曾经在非常酷的 脸部辨认运算法系统 工作过
Todd's been working on this really cool facial recognition algorithm.

831
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:10,904
那不全都是我写的程式
It's not all my code.

832
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:12,660
它是由Carnegie Mellon公司开发出来的
It was developed at Carnegie Mellon,

833
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:15,903
但是 我做了一点 修改与调整
but I've tweaked it a little.

834
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:17,830
他太谦虚了
He's so modest.

835
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:20,628
抱歉
Sorry.

836
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:24,149
这也许需要一分钟
This might take a minute.

837
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:40,825
它正在收寻
It's just searching.

838
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:57,705
露西? Hello?
Luce? Hello?

839
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:59,961
我们找到 相配的了
We've got hits.

840
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:09,307
Whoa.

841
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:11,460
看看这些名子
Look at the names.

842
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:13,304
他们一定是亲属关系
they must be relatives.

843
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:15,750
Oh, what?什么

844
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,300
这...怎么会..
The actual... Fuck.

845
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:26,141
把它印出来
Print it.

846
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:28,228
我去拿(佩恩说)
I'll get it.

847
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:42,180
Todd,我指望你有点解释
Todd, I'm counting on you having some sort of explanation

848
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:44,501
因为我真的在这相片中
because I am really struggling here.

849
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:49,429
我也不知道 这是怎么回事
I haven't got the faintest idea.

850
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,140
我爱你
I love you.

851
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:58,468
让我们看看 还能找到些什么
Let's see what else we can find.

852
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:35,191
它又发生了..
It's happening again.

853
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:42,468
不
No.

854
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:47,471
离我远点(露西 喊叫)
Leave me alone!

855
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:50,227
露西?一切都还好吗?
Luce? Everything okay?

856
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:54,942
Luce?露西

857
01:03:58,540 --> 01:03:59,382
Penn!(陶德 叫喊)

858
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,750
我去找 Penn佩恩(陶德说)
I've gotta find Penn!

859
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,067
Penn!佩恩

860
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,385
佩恩 你在哪里?
Penn, where are you?

861
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:07,500
陶德!
Todd!

862
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,070
我必须找到 佩恩
I've gotta find Penn!

863
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,511
- No!
- Penn!佩恩

864
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:12,907
Todd!陶德

865
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:19,021
Todd!陶德

866
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:24,147
No!

867
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:20,820
在我们学校医务室这里
Here at the school infirmary

868
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:24,020
我们可以提供 与医院相同的 照顾
we provide the same care she'd receive at the hospital.

869
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:25,420
我要带她回家
I want to take her home.

870
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:29,027
医生说得很清楚.她现在的状况需要 临床观察
The doctor's clear. She needs to remain under clinical supervision.

871
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,506
要多久？ -直到她稳定
- For how long?- Until she's stable.

872
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:33,546
你应该休息一下
You should get some rest.

873
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:38,229
我会打电话到旅馆叫你,一旦露西可以接见访客
We'll call you at the hotel as soon as Luce is able to receive visitors.

874
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:43,589
这里 没有我们能做的了
There was nothing we could have done.

875
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:45,180
我拒绝接受 这事实
I refuse to accept that.

876
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:47,020
我本来可以警告她的. 我可以在那里...
I could have warned her.I could have been there...

877
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,660
那样会有帮助吗? -事情过了,没有关系了,好吗?
- When has that ever helped? - It doesn't matter, okay?

878
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:51,629
她需要我们,而我们让她失望
She needs us and we let her down.

879
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:54,741
这是个犯罪案件调查吗? 目前不是
- Is this a criminal investigation? - Not at the moment.

880
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:58,903
火灾是因为 闪电 引起的.那是初步的报告
The fire was caused by lightning.That report is preliminary.

881
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:01,380
这案子与 Trevor Beckman的案子 很类似
Given the similarity to the Trevor Beckman case

882
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:03,260
我们一定要询问她
we'll definitely want to question her.

883
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:06,786
我不允许你跟她说话 在没有律师的陪同下
I don't want you talking to her without her attorney present.

884
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:21,110
我们今天聚在这里
We come together today

885
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:24,820
来吊念 我们失去的亲爱的朋友(Todd),他是如此的仁慈大方
to mourn the loss of a dear friend,a kind and generous...

886
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:27,580
他(Todd)的生命是如此短暂
whose life was far too brief to mourn the loss...

887
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:31,381
悲剧的发生让我们十分震惊
whose tragic passing comes as a shock to us all.

888
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:35,420
我们会永远记得 这位仁慈 又大方的朋友
We will always remember a kind and generous friend

889
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,821
他的陪伴总是 带给我们欢乐
someone whose company was always a pleasure

890
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:42,180
虽然今天 我们可以理解地要克服悲痛
and although today we are understandably overcome with grief

891
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:45,662
我要求你们要有信心
I ask you to have faith that in time

892
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:48,706
我们的伤痛将化为力量
our pain will prove strengthening

893
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:51,302
而这个最后的遗愿
and ultimately a testament

894
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:54,101
是陶德在乎的
to how much Todd mattered

895
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:56,109
而且直到永远
and always will.

896
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:00,420
他不仅仅是个慈爱的孩子
Not only was he a loving son

897
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:04,221
而且是仁慈又大方的朋友
but he was also a kind and generous friend.

898
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:10,308
我们必须把我们的悲伤 传换成 某种力量
We must transform our sadness into something strengthening.

899
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:12,907
这就是 我们如何纪念他的生命的方式
That's how we celebrate his life

900
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:16,310
与 确保他的遗愿
and ensure his legacy.

901
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:21,105
你在他被杀后 才出现在他的葬礼吗?
You show up to his funeral after you get him killed?

902
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:22,540
我知道 这是你干的
I know you're the one doing this.

903
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:23,660
你在胡说什么?
What are you talking about?

904
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:26,020
雕像坠落 ,图书馆起火
The statue. The fire in the library.

905
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:27,220
你试图要杀露西
You were trying to kill her.

906
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:28,940
杀死露西,是你该做的事,丹尼尔
Killing Luce is your thing, Daniel.

907
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:30,500
你竟敢....
Don't you dare...

908
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:33,345
你是怎么了,丹尼尔? 你害怕 来点竞争吗?
What's the matter, Daniel? You afraid of a little competition?

909
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:35,580
我对露西的爱意 是真的
What I feel for Luce is real.

910
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:38,630
她这次不一样了.她应该得到 比 你可以给她的 更多
She's different this time. She deserves more than you can give her.

911
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:41,267
如果 你再接近她...你想干嘛?
- If you come near her...- You'll what?

912
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:45,228
你要看她死去 多少遍呢?
How many times do you have to watch her die?

913
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:09,231
我爱你
I love you.

914
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:38,747
Luce!露西

915
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:40,947
Oh, Penn!佩恩

916
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:43,187
Luce!露西

917
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:48,422
陶德呢?
Todd?

918
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:56,706
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

919
01:09:58,220 --> 01:10:00,940
我真的抱歉,都是我的错
I'm so, so sorry. It's my fault.

920
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:02,351
不要这么说
Oh, don't say that.

921
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:08,185
是真的.那影子幽魂是完全同一个
It's true. The shadows were exactly the same.

922
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:11,827
它是完全同一个...别说了. 好吗?
- It was the exact same...- Stop it, okay?

923
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:15,565
不是你 造成的
You did not cause this.

924
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:18,671
我不要再听到它
I won't hear it.

925
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:23,187
好吗
Okay.

926
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:35,386
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

927
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:50,026
你许愿了吗?
Did you make a wish?

928
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:52,940
前世 与 命中注定
Past lives and destinies.

929
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:54,590
你要真相
You want the truth.

930
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:57,740
她一点都不认识我.只要一个亲吻.
She doesn't know me at all.All it takes is a kiss.

931
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:58,900
但是 他知道 就是她
But he knows it's her.

932
01:10:58,980 --> 01:10:59,900
露西,不
Luce! No!

933
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:01,869
你亲吻他,你就会死
Kiss him and you'll die.

934
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:03,940
是谁对他们下的诅咒?
Who put the curse on them?

935
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:07,307
是恶魔 他本人.  -丹尼尔,不
- It was the devil himself.- Daniel, no!

936
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:11,145
露西,不要
Luce, no.

937
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:12,746
你会死的
You will die.

938
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:14,141
你会死的
You will die.

939
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:04,186
你好点了吗?
You feeling better?

940
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:08,942
我全身都疼,但是 我还活着
Every part of me hurts, but I'm alive.

941
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:12,061
那很好
Well, that's something.

942
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:15,386
我记得
I remember.

943
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,022
什么事? 所有的事
- What? - Everything.

944
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:21,907
火灾
The fire.

945
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:25,020
你抱着我
You carrying me.

946
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:29,991
在你手臂中 感觉像是我们...-Well,你很可笑 荒谬
- Being in your arms, it felt like we were...- Well, you were delirious.

947
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:34,162
也许是
Maybe.

948
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:39,024
但是,我不只 记得这些
But that's not all I remember.

949
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:44,465
我还记得 这张照片
I remember this.

950
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:48,149
我记得 我们一起照相 的日期
I remember the day this was taken.

951
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:50,602
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

952
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:51,861
够了
Enough!

953
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:54,830
我知道 我是谁
I know what I know.

954
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:06,745
我这一生 人们都说我疯了
My whole life people have told me that I'm crazy.

955
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:12,384
露西,  -让我们看看 他们是否 正确
- Luce.- Let's see if they're right.

956
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:14,990
不,露西 从那里下来
No, Luce, get down from there.

957
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,147
不,露西
No, Luce.

958
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:21,986
不!
No!

959
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:08,103
一直都是你,露西
It will always be you, Luce.

960
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:11,944
从过去到现在,一直都是 你
Just as it always has been.

961
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:23,271
现在 不是多愁善感的时刻了
Now is not the time for sentimentality.

962
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,342
露西吗?
Luce?

963
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:55,385
这项链 是 我给你的
I gave you this.

964
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:57,864
已经 很久 很久了
It was a long time ago.

965
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:01,265
这怎么可能?
How is this possible?

966
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:06,940
没有关系. 不,每次坏事
- It's okay.- No, every bad thing

967
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:08,500
要发生在我身上 都是因为这东西
that's ever happened to me is because of that.

968
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:10,620
不,他们部会伤害你.他们只是观察
No, they can't hurt you. They just observe.

969
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,620
那火灾.他们杀了 Travor.
The fires. They killed Trevor.

970
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:15,580
露西.影子幽灵 不会造成火灾,也不是 你放的火
Luce, the shadows didn't cause the fire and neither did you.

971
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:17,469
它们叫做 Anocess
They're called Announcers.

972
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:18,947
看
Look.

973
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:21,940
把它们想成一道 可以看到过去的窗户
Think of them as windows into the past.

974
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:26,103
他们追踪你生命中最重要的时刻
They're attracted to the most important moments in your life.

975
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:35,630
我看到的是什么?
What am I seeing?

976
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:41,144
我们在一起的生活
Our lives together.

977
01:16:57,180 --> 01:16:59,660
我们已经相爱 数千年了
We've been in love for thousands of years.

978
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:03,501
露西 所有你的 幻觉都是真的
Luce, all your visions are real.

979
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:08,630
所以 我们是一直在 转世 轮回吗?
So we're reincarnated?

980
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:11,261
只有你是
You are.

981
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:13,781
我是..
I'm...

982
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:15,821
一个天使
An angel.

983
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,309
我是 坠落天使之一
I'm one of the Fallen.

984
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:27,066
停止
Stop!

985
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:28,671
不要 吻他,露西
Don't do it, Luce.

986
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:30,391
你吻他 你就会死
Kiss him and you will die.

987
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:35,580
这就是为什么 我一直试着躲开你,但是 我又不能
This is why I tried so hard to push you away but I can't.

988
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:37,646
你没有告诉她吗?(接吻 与 死亡)
You didn't tell her?

989
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:41,307
我非常抱歉 -真不可思议,
- I'm so sorry.- Unbelievable. You're unbelievable.

990
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:43,389
什么? 我不了解,为什么?
What? I don't understand, why?

991
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:46,740
诅咒是我的惩罚,为了不让我选边站(Lucifer 或上帝)
The curse is my punishment for not taking a side at the Fall.

992
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:48,100
露西 不要听信 他所说的
Luce, don't listen to him.

993
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:50,467
待在我身边 露西 ,我选择了你
Stay, Luce. I chose you.

994
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:52,306
我选择 爱情
I chose love.

995
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:53,860
不要听信 他所说的,露西
Don't listen to him, Luce.

996
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:55,820
如果 你吻他 你就会死
If you kiss him, you will die.

997
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:58,540
我已经看过 数千遍了.   -不,这次不一样
- I've seen it a thousand times.- No, this time it's different.

998
01:17:58,620 --> 01:17:59,940
我保证 这次不一样
I promise it is different.

999
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:01,300
他是个骗子 露西
He's a liar, Luce.

1000
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:03,140
(Cam:) 如果你与我再一起,我可以保护你
If you stay with me, I can protect you.

1001
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:04,580
(丹尼尔:) 你已经看过 我真正的形式
You've seen me in my true form.

1002
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:05,860
这次不一样
This is different.

1003
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:07,060
我可以保护你
I can protect you.

1004
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:09,980
这会是 我们厮守 在一起的机会
This could be our chance.

1005
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:11,420
请听我的
Please.

1006
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,502
露西,我可以给你 一个未来
Luce, I can offer you a future.

1007
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:15,020
一个生命
A life.

1008
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:20,790
我不能再一次 失去你
I can't lose you again.

1009
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:27,430
我知道 我想要的
I know what I want.

1010
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:39,982
不
No!

1011
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:00,546
我还活着
I'm still here.

1012
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:06,540
你相信 你已经打败 诅咒吗?
You think you've beaten the curse?

1013
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:08,861
你不知道 她(露西)正处于是多么的危险之中
You have no idea how much danger she's in.

1014
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:10,980
大天使 Lucifer知道 她 还没有受洗
Lucifer knows she's not baptized.

1015
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:12,420
我不了解 告诉我为什么?
I don't understand. Tell me why.

1016
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,660
他(丹尼尔) 为自己解除的诅咒 不是为你解除诅咒
He lifted the curse for himself, not for you.

1017
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:16,020
Lucifer 会来找她 现在
He'll come for her now.

1018
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:17,704
丹尼尔 不能保护你, 露西
Daniel can't protect you, Luce.

1019
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:19,102
我能
I can!

1020
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:21,945
她跟我在一起 才会安全
She's safer with me!

1021
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:26,660
事情有自然法则,丹尼尔
There's a natural order to things, Daniel.

1022
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:28,220
你不可以 随你高兴 就这样做
You can't just do as you please.

1023
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,064
转世 轮回的循环 已经被打破了
Well, the cycle's been broken.

1024
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:32,110
Roland! Molly!

1025
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:38,946
Luce!

1026
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:40,341
你跟我一起来
You're coming with me!

1027
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:43,348
保护她的安全,我需要跟 Cam 把事情做个了断
Keep her safe. I need to deal with Cam.

1028
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:45,429
不论我带露西去哪里,我不要 Cam 跟随
Where I'm taking her,I don't want him to follow.

1029
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:48,820
他会把 Lucifer 带来找我们
He'll lead Lucifer right to us.

1030
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:50,265
他们都是天使
They're all angels.

1031
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:53,820
我不会让你 把露西带去给Lucifer
I won't let you take her to Lucifer!

1032
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:57,590
我不再 听信Lucifer了. -你骗人
I don't answer to him anymore.  -Liar.

1033
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:34,621
你把露西陷入 危险的那个人, 丹尼尔
You're the one putting her in danger, Daniel.

1034
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,148
不要假装 你在乎 她的安危
Don't pretend you even care about her!

1035
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:12,346
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

1036
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:13,820
我可以保护她
I can protect her.

1037
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:15,311
离她 远一点
Stay away from her!

1038
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:21,866
这是怎么回事?
What the heck!

1039
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:24,180
回到你们的房间 把门关上
Back to your rooms. Shut the door!

1040
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:25,785
这是一级防范
This is a lockdown.

1041
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:29,745
等待 事情结束
Wait for the all clear.

1042
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:31,510
这是一级防范,把门关上
It's a lockdown. Shut the door.

1043
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:35,022
不要害怕.   -我不害怕
- Don't be afraid.- I'm not.

1044
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:01,911
我不是你的敌人
I'm not your enemy.

1045
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:04,224
我没有要杀 露西
I'm not trying to kill her.

1046
01:22:04,660 --> 01:22:06,582
那么是谁?
Then who?

1047
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:07,786
露西 等等
Luce! Wait!

1048
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:11,303
图书馆火灾 是她放的火.她...
She set the fire in the library. She...

1049
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:14,348
佩恩
Penn?

1050
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:17,348
不
No!

1051
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:21,145
不
No!

1052
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:23,427
去吧
Go!

1053
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:27,627
露西 你的时间到了,我已经厌倦了 等待
Luce, your time has come.I am tired of waiting.

1054
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:29,620
结束吧 现在
This ends now.

1055
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:33,340
你每一次出现 就阻断 丹尼尔 返回天堂的意愿
Every breath you take keeps Daniel from his rightful place in heaven!

1056
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:35,820
丹尼尔! -你才是真正的 诅咒
- Daniel!- You are the real curse.

1057
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:37,265
露西
Luce!

1058
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:39,222
露西
Luce!

1059
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:42,710
Sophia, what have you done?
Sophia,你做了什么事?

1060
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:44,220
你宣称上帝的仆人
You claim to be a servant of God.

1061
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:46,220
我是.战争正在进行中
I am. There's a war going on.

1062
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:48,260
忠诚的士兵 该做 他们必须做的事
Loyal soldiers do what they must.

1063
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:49,260
包括谋杀吗?
Including murder?

1064
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:51,620
你拒绝为 大局着想
You refuse to see the bigger picture.

1065
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,350
你一直 都是这样
You always have.

1066
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:57,342
她死了 你将不得不 选择 哪一方(Lucifer 或 上帝)
With her gone you'd have been forced to choose a side

1067
01:22:57,820 --> 01:23:00,346
而且 秩序将会恢复
and order would have been restored.

1068
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:07,140
谢谢你
Thank you.

1069
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:09,941
我不了解为什么她要这样做
I don't understand why she'd do that.

1070
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,065
她是一个 盲信入迷的人
She's a fanatic, Luce.

1071
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,820
她替上帝做战 但是,她太过头了
She fights for god, but she went too far.

1072
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:15,500
为什么 她要杀死 佩恩?
Why would Sophia kill Penn?

1073
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:16,900
她为什么要杀我呢?
Why did she try to kill me?

1074
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:20,868
你还没有受洗.如果你死了,你将永远不会进入轮回
You're not baptized.If you die, it'll be forever.

1075
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:23,940
Sophia 认为你死了(永不轮回), 我就没有理由留在人间
Sophia thought with you gone I'd have no reason to stay on earth

1076
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:25,590
然后我会返回天堂
and I'd return to heaven.

1077
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:26,861
但是 Cam 是正确的
But Cam was right.

1078
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:29,069
Lucifer 会来找你
Lucifer will be coming for you.

1079
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:31,620
那就是为什么 我必须带你去一个安全的地方
Which is why I need to get you somewhere safe.

1080
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:34,340
我知道一个地方 ,我有朋友在那儿,他们会保护我们
I know a place. I have friends there.They'll protect us.

1081
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:35,581
我们必须走了
We have to go.

1082
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:37,780
我们现在不能离开,我不能让 Penn 留在这里
I can't leave now. I can't leave Penn.

1083
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:39,100
我们会照顾她
We'll take care of her.

1084
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:40,142
佩恩
Penn!

1085
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:43,145
她将会跟我们一起去.走吧.
She'll come with us. Go. Please.

1086
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:46,907
露西
Luce.

1087
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:49,070
他们会带 佩恩 一起来
They'll take Penn with them.

1088
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:52,900
快没有时间了,我们必须走了
There's no more time. We have to go.

1089
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:54,391
等一下,听我说
Wait a minute. Listen.

1090
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:57,420
我一生都在寻找真相
My whole life I've been searching for the truth.

1091
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,343
我一直想知道 我到底是谁
I've been trying to figure out who I am.

1092
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:02,630
为什么,我从来无法溶入我应有的生活
Why I never seem to fit in to the life that was supposed to be mine.

1093
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:04,390
现在,我好害怕
And now I'm terrified.

1094
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:06,740
我有 比过去更多的疑问
I have more questions than I ever have before

1095
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:09,668
这就是原因
but... this is it.

1096
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:11,545
这就是我
This is who I am.

1097
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:14,000
这就是 我心的依归
This is where I belong.

1098
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,490
在这里 跟你在一起
Right here, with you.

1099
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:19,346
我爱你
I love you.
