西贡小姐

5
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,300
我们当中，会出现一位“西贡小姐”
One of us will be Miss Saigon

6
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,510
我重说一遍！是“西贡，小姐”
I spread the word, it's Miss Saigon

7
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,890
- 谁离开了？谁还没有走？ - 别多管闲事，把你的裤子给我穿上！
- Who's left in town? Who hasn't gone?  - Shut up and get your hot pants on

8
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,060
- 街上的大兵越来越少了  - 他们走了，我们能活下去吗？
- Each day more GI's disappear  - Will we survive when no-one's here?

9
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,940
你们必须要相信我这个“工程师”！
You girls must trust your Engineer

10
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,940
我今天带来一个惊喜，过来！
I have a little surprise for you. Come here. Hey!

11
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,030
我在村里发现了这个姑娘，还是个闺女！
I found this new girl from the country, untouched

12
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,280
给她扮上！
Get her ready

13
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,070
我来教教这个雏儿怎么放松！
I'd give that virgin act a rest

14
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,910
你得学会说“你是我的第一个美国客人”
You are my first American

15
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,830
让开让开！整天这样你们不累吗？
alley, alley! Why does it take all day?

16
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,630
把你们的屁股都洗干净！今晚要开张了！
Get your asses on stage, I'm raising cash tonight

17
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,670
我们当中，会出现一位“西贡小姐”
One of us will be Miss Saigon

18
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,210
西贡的风声紧了好几个礼拜了
They say Saigon has weeks

19
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,090
- 你们各就各位  - 今晚，我就是“西贡小姐”
- I say it's time to pack  - Tonight I must be Miss Saigon

20
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:23,680
这些臭娘们变得越来越没用了！
Each night these little buns of theirs are worth less and less

21
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,560
我得赶紧捞一笔，买个绿卡一走了之
I need a visa fast and I'm not looking back

22
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,060
他娘的，大兵们来了
Son of a bitch, they're here

23
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,890
我还能干我的老本行
I can still engineer

24
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,190
乔伊先生，这边请！
Monsieur Joey, please, come inside

25
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,440
就像往常一样，我的小荡妇们
It's like the old days,my little gamines

26
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,070
- 没问题  - 去看看谁来了？
- Oh, sure  - Just look who's in there

27
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,990
- 陆战队的大兵！ - 来了吗？
- A gang of Marines  - They're here?

28
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,110
咱们要把他们榨干！
We'll pick 'em clean

29
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,120
- 今晚就专心做这一件事  - 扯淡！
- That's what tonight's all about  - Bullshit!

30
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,450
没准哪个大兵就能把你带走
One of these boys might be your ticket out

31
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,500
- 把这衣服脱下来  - 哇哦
- Get out of that dress  - Wow.

32
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,210
嘿，瞧瞧
No, wait

33
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,620
- 这是我新的小宝贝儿嘛！ - 啥！
- It's my new princess  - What?

34
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,250
- 小宝贝儿？ - 你他妈的在跟我开玩笑！
- Princess?  - Are you fucking kidding me?

35
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,590
雏儿，能卖个好价钱
A virgin will give them a treat

36
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,260
闭嘴！
Shut up!

37
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:08,770
闭上眼睛，享受吧
Lower your eyelids and play sweet

38
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,060
男人们都喜欢在晚上找新新鲜刺激
Men pay the moon to get fresh meat

39
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,980
新鲜也就新鲜一次！别吵了，别吵了！
Fresh is only fresh once alley, alley

40
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,400
排好队，摆好姿势
Line up and do your song

41
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,190
别让人家等的太久
Don't make the show too long

42
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,690
好戏开场啦！
Voile! On stage, all

43
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,450
欢迎来到，追梦国度！
Welcome to Dreamland!

44
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,590
西贡的夜晚性感火爆
The heat is on in Saigon

45
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,350
姑娘们等着我们来搞
The girls are ready to screw

46
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,810
她们当中的一位会成为“西贡小姐”
One of these slits here will be Miss Saigon

47
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,730
当我们无法突破防线，猜猜我们会做什么？
And since we're stuck here in hell, what's a soldier to do?

48
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,150
这里臭气连天，结束战争就是个谎言
The stink is making me choke! Turns out this war is a joke

49
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,070
而忘掉谎言却只能靠自己
Turns out the joke is on you

50
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,740
嘿，克里斯先生，约翰先生，这儿有个新来哒！
Hey, Monsieur Chris, Monsieur John, a gift

51
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,950
我知道你们来这儿是为了西贡小姐
You've come to win Miss Saigon

52
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,240
你请客？
You brought him

53
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,500
我请我的哥们来度过他难忘的一夜
I gotta get my friend laid as a last souvenir

54
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,960
别废话了，我的兴致已经到这儿了
I love you, pal, but your bullshit I've had up to here

55
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,500
西贡的夜晚性感火爆
The heat is on in Saigon

56
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,840
反正我们还没撤离，我来给你找个姑娘
But till they tell us we're gone,I'm gonna buy you a girl

57
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,050
- 来杯啤酒就行了  - 搞起来！
- You can buy me a beer  - It's showtime!

58
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,190
来自湄公河口，海防的姑娘！
From Haiphong to the Mekong Delta,

59
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,320
请容我把西贡最美的姑娘隆重介绍给你！

60
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,240

- It's just the right size  - Yvette

62
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,200
我的大腿还合你胃口吗？
Don't you enjoy how it rides up my thighs?

63
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,540
- 多米尼卡！ - 看看我的身段
- Dominique  - Look from behind

64
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,290
- 绝对惊爆眼球！ - 伊万妮！

65
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,750
我是战场上最致命的武器！

66
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,210
- 菲菲！ - 陆战队的大兵们，看看我的活儿！
- Fifi  - For a Marine I'll show more

67
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,380
我都浑身发软了！
You won't get up off the floor

68
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,380
西贡的夜晚性感火爆
The heat is on in Saigon

69
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,140
别让我离开，这些小妞都美极了
Don't tell me I'm reassigned, all that chickenshit sucks

70
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,390
今晚我要纵情享受，十美元就能玩儿个够
Tonight I'm out of my mind, not to mention ten bucks

71
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:17,310
你们熟知的！河内最性感的妞儿！
You all know her as the sex toy from Hanoi.

72
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,100
陈万姬小姐！
Miss Gig Van Tran.

73
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,150
如果我是你的梦中情人，我能让你神魂颠倒
If I'm your pin-up, I'll melt all your brass

74
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,740
把我的照片挂上墙，图钉按在我的屁股上
Stuck on the wall with a pin in my ass

75
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,740
如果你搞上了我，你就坐上了头等舱
If you get me, you will travel first class

76
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,830
我还让你知道，我有魔力
I'll show you, we'll make magic, Cherie

77
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:39,420
来来来！买票入场就有机会免费玩儿姑娘啦！
You buy more tickets from me, the winner gets her for free

78
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,960
西贡的肉体是如此卑贱！
The meat is cheap in Saigon

79
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,550
我已经心灰意冷，娼妇也许能唤醒我
I used to love getting stoned, waking up with some whore

80
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,680
我不知道为什么这样，我感觉很失落
I don't know why I went dead, it's not fun any more

81
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,350
乡下的干净姑娘怎么样？
How about something fresh from the country?

82
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:57,520
原装没动，原封原样的，小金！
Legs unpasted, parts uncharted. Kim.

83
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,440
我今年十七岁，我刚到这里
I'm 17 and I'm new here today

84
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:07,690
我来自遥远的农村乡下
The village I come from seems so far away

85
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,280
这里的姑娘都比我会说话
All of these girls here know much more what to say

86
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:16,950
但是我知道，我该如何展现自己
But I know I'm so much more than you see

87
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,250
我有无数的梦想
A million dreams are in me

88
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,670
天哪，约翰，她是谁？
Jesus, John, who is she?

89
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,630
参谋部眉头紧皱
The Cong is tightening the noose

90
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,010
谁知道明天我能否活着？
Is it a week or a day or an hour we got?

91
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:35,010
今晚就是最后的一晚，不用白不用！
Tonight could be our last shot, got to put it to use

92
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,600
宝贝儿，我兴致高昂，你能否满足？
I've got a fever, babe, and you're gonna catch it

93
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,690
宝贝儿，我有个地方不舒服，你能否平复？
I got an itch, and, baby, you'd better scratch it

94
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,940
蜜蜜、万姬、伊薇特还是伊万妮
Mimi, Gig, Yvette or Yvonne

95
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,990
给我来扎啤酒！跟西贡小姐共度美好时光！
Gonna buy me a beer! Here's to you, Miss Saigon

96
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:53,200
伊薇特！伊万妮！

还有万姬！

99
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,710
注意，下面就要宣布了
Attention, sail vouch plait.

100
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:06,250
根据投票！陈万姬小姐当选为今晚的“西贡小姐”！
By popular demand, Miss Gig Van Tran is tonight's Miss Saigon.

101
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,340
西贡的夜晚性感火爆
The heat is on in Saigon

102
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,970
我怎能拒绝这气息？
How'd we get used to the smell?

103
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,890
我们不要浪费时光，一波未平，一波又起
So let's get wasted, get high and get laid

104
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:20,930
- 稳操胜券  - 鬼门关前的告别狂欢
- Shoo-hew!  - A goodbye party in hell

105
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,270
现在，公布抽奖结果！
And now, who wins my little pussycat?

106
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,770
六十六号顾客！
Number 66!

107
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,660
谁来照顾你宝贝？
Who takes care of you, baby?

108
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,580
就是你嘛，带我去美国怎么样？
You do, but will you take me to America?

109
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,420
又来了，现在不行！
Come on. Not right now. Damn!

110
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,750
我能当个好太太
Hey! I'll make a good wife.

111
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,300
- 我说了，不行！ - 你这混蛋！
- I said no!  - You prick!

112
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,970
- 让我来，让我来  - 都是胡诌八扯！
- Let me take care of this.  - This is bullshit!

113
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:58,390
别跟我整没用的！
Don't fuck with me.

114
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,730
- 没事了，没事了，万姬只是有点累了  - 神经病
- It's OK. Gig, she likes it rough.  - Crazy, man.

115
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,730
来来，再喝点酒，再找个姑娘
Come on, drink some more. Play with the girls.

116
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:41,220
满屋嘈杂，恶语相加
They are not nice, they're mostly noise

117
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:47,730
他们赌咒发誓时像条汉子、胡搞起来却是个孩子
They swear like men, they screw like boys

118
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:54,780
他们根本就没有良心
I know there's nothing in their hearts

119
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:03,370
每一次我揽他入怀
But every time I take one in my arms

120
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,750
就开始
It starts

121
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,630
脑海里的幻影浮现
The movie in my mind

122
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:18,760
他们抛给我们的梦想
The dream they leave behind

123
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:24,470
我无法忘怀
A scene I can't erase

124
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:31,730
每当士兵们抱住我，我就想
And in a strong GI's embrace

125
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,400
逃离这种生活
Flee this life

126
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:43,660
逃离这种地方
Flee this place

127
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,960
连篇的幻影来来去去
The movie plays and plays

128
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:57,050
我要找到终身相许
I'll find my true romance

129
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:02,140
他带我远走高飞
He takes me to a place

130
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:07,430
去一个不用跳舞地方
Where I don't have to dance

131
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,730
我给他生儿育女
Our children laugh all day

132
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,650
但现在我已经不抱希望了
But all that I've been through

133
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:23,070
梦想已经不能成真了
Can't make my dream come true

134
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,000
梦想啊！
Dream

135
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,170
我苦苦追寻的梦想啊！
The dream I long to find

136
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:39,340
只是连篇的幻影
The movie in my mind

137
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,560
我已经不会哭，已经麻木
I will not cry, I will not think

138
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,110
我只能继续跳舞，继续给他们灌酒
I'll do my dance, I'll make them drink

139
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,410
强颜欢笑的，那并不是我
When I make love, it won't be me

140
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,120
他们的踢打
And if they hurt me

141
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,960
我只是闭上眼睛顺受
I'll just close my eyes and see

142
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,670
满屋嘈杂，恶语相加
They are not nice, they're mostly noise

143
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,960
只有连篇的幻影
The movie in my mind

144
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,760
他们屠戮时是条汉子，倒下时又是个孩子
They kill like men, they die like boys

145
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,890
我们的梦想也来来去去
The dream that fills my head

146
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,770
他们大把的给钱，却从来不关心
They give their cash, they keep their hearts

147
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,850
一个未曾沾上献血的人
A man who will not kill

148
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,770
日复一日、夜复一夜
But every night again it starts

149
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:41,240
他会为我挺身而出吗？
He'll fight for me instead

150
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,660
这样的男人只会在军营里恐惧
He'll keep the fear at bay

151
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,960
更不可能在晚上出现在这里
So no one comes at night

152
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:57,130
把我的梦吹散了吧！
To blow the dream away

153
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,010
梦啊！
Dream

154
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:06,850
我必须要找到的梦啊！
The dream I have to find

155
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:13,480
就算只是连篇的幻影！
The movie in my mind

156
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,480
- 嘿，宝贝儿，来啊  - 嘿！
- Hey, baby, come here.  - Hey!

157
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:36,710
每当大兵们抱住我，我就想
And in a strong GI's embrace

158
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:43,510
逃离这生活
Flee this life

159
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:51,390
逃离这地方
Flee this place

160
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:58,020
在那遥远的世界
A world that's far away

161
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:02,400
生活不会如此的不堪
Where life is not unkind

162
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:14,000
虽然只是连篇的幻影
The movie in my mind

163
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,920
真感人啊，好了好了，赶快回去接客！
alleluia, alley, get back to work. Now'.!

164
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,600
- 别烦我  - 嘿，约翰先生
- Come on, man.  - Hey, Monsieur John.

165
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,350
你想不想发财呢？风风光光的回家？
How would you like to get rich? Go home in style?

166
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,940
- 谁不想啊？怎么说？ - 那就好
- Yeah, OK, what's the pitch?  - Yeah.

167
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,400
一张美国绿卡，你开个价
A US visa to help me get out

168
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,530
只需要你去大使馆运作一下
Lend me a bit of your embassy clout, you dig, baby?

169
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,820
现在绝对不可能了，你比我清楚
There isn't a chance, pal, you're too well known

170
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:52,030
或者，你把那个穿裙子的姑娘给我
Look, what I want is that girl in the dress

171
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,620
眼光不错老兄，她是小金
You have a good eye, her name is Kim

172
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,450
她是我新的姑娘
She's my new princess

173
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,790
你来试试她？
You give her a try

174
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,870
伙计，天哪！这太阳是从哪边出来了？
My buddy, Chris, it's like something just snapped

175
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,920
她可是人人都想要的，她身上可是有宝贝啊
She's what he needs, she's got treasures untapped

176
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,090
但是我必须事先警告你，她可不便宜
But I have to warn you, she don't come cheap

177
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,720
没问题，伙计
I got that covered, my man.

178
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,430
- 她，要卖二十美元！ - 她？就她？二十美元？
- It's got to be 20 for my princess  - 20 for this shit?

179
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,470
她可是个雏儿！啊…不好，说漏嘴了
She's sort of a virgin... well, more or less

180
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,850
- 您拿着  - 再拿二十块我就给你开个房间
- You take it.  - For 20 more you get a room and key

181
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,230
你耍我！
Don't fuck me, man!

182
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,560
五十块钱就能和她待上一整夜
For 50 bucks, she's got the whole night free

183
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,990
“工程师”推荐的姑娘准备错！
No one gives you a buzz like the Engineer does

184
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,490
你来几个人都可以
You may share if you like.

185
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:33,240
别太羡慕我，伙计，你熊了
Stop drooling, white boy, you're losing your cool

186
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,830
- 她太引人犯罪了  - 约翰，你冷静点！
- You like this jail bait?  - John, open your eyes

187
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:40,500
这太过分了！简直不可救药！
This is the end of the line, this whole rotten scene

188
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,380
她可是个好货啊！你这是怎么了？
She's good, man. What? Come on!

189
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,880
这是个小姑娘，我们会受处分的
This little girl, we could be in the sack

190
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,000
我知道，放开！
I know, man

191
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,720
而且我不能做出格的事情
And I would take something I can't give back

192
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,010
该回去了，该远离这个肮脏的地方了
It's time to go home, it's time to get clean

193
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,760
不不不
No, no, no

194
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,430
没想到你这么纯情，我都快哭了
I'm starting to cry, you're so out of touch

195
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,600
你就是想得太多，顾忌太多
The trouble with you is you think too much

196
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,810
- 别碰我  - 一个娼妇总好过寂寞的床
- Get the fuck off of me!  - A whore is better than an empty bed

197
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,480
你需要放松一下才能知道你需要什么
Man, you need some action to fill your head

198
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:12,990
别犹豫了，工程师说的准没错！
Nothing gives you a hit like the Engineer's shit

199
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,370
说的太对了！
That's right

200
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,830
我们走，离开这里
Let's get out of here. Let's go!

201
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,290
我的小宝贝儿，我猜对了
My little princess, I was right

202
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,080
你是今晚最成功的交易
You are the first to score tonight

203
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,300
你今天就盯着他
You caught that sergeant by the nose

204
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,510
在那个中士离开前哪都别去
You stay with him until he goes

205
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,430
叫他克里斯，他喜欢
Call him Chris, he'll like that

206
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,850
- 求求你，不要……  - 你说你想干活儿，这就是活儿！
- Please, don't  - You said you needed a job

207
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,520
你说过你会接客！
You said you'd turn a trick

208
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,390
你最好照你说的做，快点！
You better prove it, and quick

209
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,570
克里斯先生
Monsieur Chris?

210
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,990
别担心，我刚刚亲手给她洗过澡…哈哈哈
Don't worry, she's clean. I washed her myself.

211
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,740
来，音乐！
Look at that. Music.

212
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:01,000
她是个非常好的姑娘，交给别人我可不放心
She's a very good girl. I'll give her to somebody else.

213
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,710
- 你滚开！ - 好的，宝贝儿
- You fuck off.  - All right, baby.

214
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,480
约翰先生！吹个高调儿哒！
Monsieur John! Hit the high note!

215
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,450
我叫小金
My name is Kim

216
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,580
我喜欢你，克里斯
I like you, Chris

217
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,750
- 别这么说  - 那该怎么说？
- Don't talk like that.  - What did I say?

218
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,630
你不应该在这种地方！
You shouldn't be here.

219
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,880
拿着这个，赶紧离开！
Just take this and get the hell out of here.

220
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,060
- 真他妈的……  - 嘿，怎么了？
- Goddamn it.  - Hey. What's going on?

221
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,020
- 你不喜欢她吗？ - 哦，不，我喜欢
- You don't like her?  - Oh, yes, I do

222
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,230
我也喜欢他
I like him too

223
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,060
那就带她离开啊？
Take her away, come on, man

224
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,440
带我走吧
Take me away

225
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:14,650
求求你别说别的，带我走吧
Please, don't say a word, just come with me

226
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,360
好了，好了，现在该交钱了，你们这些吊儿郎当的大兵们
All right, it's time to pay up, you horny bastards.

227
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,610
谢谢你，托尼先生
Thank you, Monsieur Tony.

228
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,120
越早交钱，越早快活，你不会不想快活吧？
The sooner you pay, the sooner you come, and you want to come, right?

229
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,200
这是给我的？谢谢你，泰克斯，好好享受
Is that mine? Thank you, Tex. Enjoy that one.

230
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,330
嘿，底特律小伙子，你是不是忘了什么？
Hey, Detroit, you're forgetting something.

231
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,460
记得洗干净手
Wash your fingers.

232
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:34,380
约翰先生，你身上的这个可不老实，可别让她咬喽，哈哈哈
Monsieur John, this one doesn't scratch.She bites.

233
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,590
工程师，这可是支不错的雪茄
Engineer? A touch of class, man.

234
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,050
- 那我留着到美国再抽  - 你随便啦，到时候给我弄个姑娘就行
- I'll smoke this when I get to America.  - Whatever, man. Got me a lady.

235
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,150
晚安我的小心肝儿们
Sweet dreams, my princess.

236
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:57,460
为何西贡的夜如此不安
Why does Saigon never sleep at night?

237
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:01,010
这姑娘的身上为什么有橘子的香气
Why does this girl smell of orange trees?

238
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:05,180
我行差踏错，感觉如此堕落
How can I feel good when nothing's right?

239
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,310
为何天气闷热她却如此平静？
Why is she cool when there is no breeze?

240
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,810
越南啊
Vietnam

241
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,480
你从来不给出答案
You don't give answers,do you, friend?

242
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:19,240
我只能不停的追问
Just questions that don't ever end

243
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,070
神啊，这是为什么！
Why, God?

244
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,870
为什么是此时此刻
Why today?

245
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,660
我已经不能回头
I'm all through here

246
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,250
只能走下去
On my Way

247
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,590
这个地方没有什么我还能失去的了
There's nothing left here that I'll miss

248
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:41,050
为何要给我留下这样的一个夜晚
Why send me now a night like this?

249
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,680
那床榻上的姑娘是谁
Who is the girl in this rusty bed?

250
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,470
为什么我还不离开这个龌龊的房间
Why am I back in a filthy room?

251
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,680
为什么她的声音还在我心中萦绕
Why is her voice ringing in my head?

252
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,650
为什么让我沉醉于她身上劣质的香水味
Why am I high on her cheap perfume?

253
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,400
越南啊！
Vietnam

254
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,110
我知道你没有对我设防
Hey, look, I mean you no of fence

255
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:05,240
但为什么现在发生的事情如此费解
But why does nothing here make sense?

256
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,540
神啊，这是为什么！
Why, God?

257
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,830
求祢伸出手
Show your hand

258
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,290
为什么我不懂
Why can't one guy understand?

259
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,840
为什么我和一个陌生的姑娘要经历这些
I've been with girls who knew much more

260
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,720
我从未如此困惑
I've never felt confused before

261
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,180
为什么是我！
Why me?

262
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,480
祢有什么安排
What's your plan?

263
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,020
我帮不了她
I can't help her

264
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,730
没人能！
No one can

265
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,980
我想抹掉这段记忆
I want my memories as they were

266
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:48,370
但是现在如何也无法抹去
But now I'll leave remembering her

267
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,920
别挡路
Get out of my...

268
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,630
躲开！
Out Of my way!

269
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,140
在我回家之后，没人会讨论这场战争
When I went home before, no one talked of the war

270
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,850
他们从电视上知道的根本就不是我经历过的
What they knew from TV didn't have a thing to do with me

271
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,140
滚开！
Get out of here!

272
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:18,440
我要回去战斗，因为西贡已经彻底腐朽
I went back and re-upped, sure, Saigon is corrupt

273
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,610
即便退伍后只能在使馆开车
It felt better to be here driving for the embassy

274
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,990
只要多救一些人出去
Cos here if you can pull a string

275
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,780
才能让我重新感到好受
A guy like me lives like a king

276
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:35,290
放下一切，别去伤脑筋！
Just as long as you don't believe anything

277
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
坏了
Shit.

278
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,380
嘿，大兵哥，你能带我离开这里吗？
Hey, GI.Can you help me get out of here?

279
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,970
- 我帮不了你  - 我有钱！
- I can't help you.  - I've got money.

280
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,300
我不要你的钱！我不要你的钱！
I don't need your money. I don't need your money.

281
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,270
神啊！为什么！
Why, God?

282
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,690
为什么是她
Why this face?

283
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:03,980
为何战乱中她如此美丽
Why such beauty in this place?

284
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,280
我想抹掉这段记忆
I want my memories as they were

285
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:14,330
但是现在如何也无法抹去
But now I'll leave remembering her

286
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:21,500
只有她！
Just her

287
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,500
他妈的……
Fuck!

288
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,990
这些钱给你
This money's yours

289
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,910
拜托，拿着吧
Please, take it all

290
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,080
- 不够吗？ - 不不，我不想要别的
- Hey, you want more?  - No, no, I don't want anything

291
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:09,720
- 你有毛病吗？ - 我以前没做过
- What's wrong with you?  - I've not done this before

292
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,550
别骗人了
That can't be true

293
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,890
我为什么要骗你？
Why would I lie?

294
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:17,350
这里所有的姑娘都说谎，唯一的目的就是离开这里
Look, all the girls lie, they just want to get out of here

295
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,850
也许你不是那样的姑娘，但是又怎么知道呢？
Maybe you're not like that, but I don't know who you are

296
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,070
混蛋……
Fuck!

297
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:32,110
你想听听我这个越南姑娘的故事吗？
Do you want one more tale of a Vietnam girl?

298
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,160
你想听听被包办婚姻是什么滋味吗？
Want to know I was bound to a man I don't love?

299
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,540
抱歉，不想
I'm sorry.

300
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:45,630
或者你想知道我的村庄是如何化为灰烬的？
Do you want to be told how my village was burned?

301
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:51,010
还有我的家人如何被炸得粉身碎骨？
Want to hear how my family was blasted away?

302
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:56,430
你想知道我如何看他们化为一团火焰？
How I ran from the rice fields and saw them in flames?

303
00:24:56,550 --> 00:25:01,100
还有我的父母的尸首如何面目全非？
How my parents were bodies whose faces were gone?

304
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:09,440
我的心中充满痛苦
I have had my fill of pain

305
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:15,610
我不敢回想
I will not look back again

306
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:21,290
因为我早就应该死了！
I would rather die!

307
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:34,050
今晚我能来找你吗？
Can I see you tonight?

308
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,760
可以，我就在俱乐部
Well, I'll be at the club

309
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:45,140
逢场作戏，强颜欢笑
Selling beau coup amour

310
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,110
不！不！你不必这样
No. No, you won't.

311
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,280
你应该
How would you like...?

312
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,870
我应该怎样？
How would I like...?

313
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:03,410
你跟我在一起吧！
How would you like staying with me?

314
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,790
这样我能好受点
It feels right like this

315
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,330
我们就应该在一起
So that's how we should be

316
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,550
你答应吗？
So, would you like?

317
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,010
是的，我答应
Yes, I would like

318
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:17,590
好的，不说别的了，就这么说定了
OK, it's set, no more to say

319
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,850
那个混蛋的工程师！
Screw the Engineer!

320
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:23,720
你是我在这里遇到的唯一的美好
You're the one good thing that I've found out here

321
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:34,190
你是阳光
You are sunlight

322
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,610
我是月亮
And I, moon

323
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:43,290
被命运眷顾
Joined by the gods of fortune

324
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:48,750
在子夜和正午
Midnight and high noon

325
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:53,170
照耀着天空
Sharing the sky

326
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:58,090
彼此眷顾
One and the same

327
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:02,510
你和我
You and I

328
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,890
你在这里
You are here

329
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,110
像个奇迹
Like a mystery

330
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,360
我来自一个
I'm from a world

331
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:22,200
和你如此不同的世界
That's so different from all that you are

332
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,210
黑夜沐浴着光芒
How in the light of one night

333
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:34,380
我们如此接近
Did we come so far?

334
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:40,930
外边，天将破晓
Outside, day starts to dawn

335
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:47,020
你的月亮却还挂在当空
Your moon still floats on high

336
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,730
- 鸟儿们惊醒了  - 星星还在闪耀
- The birds awake  - And the stars shine true

337
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:54,860
- 我的手还在抖  - 我紧紧抓住！
- My hands still shake  - I reach for you

338
00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:01,240
我们一起在天空相遇
And we meet in the sky

339
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:32,480
你是阳光
You are sunlight

340
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:36,190
而我是月亮
And I, moon

341
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,740
在一起
Joined here

342
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:43,820
用爱的火焰
Brightening the sky

343
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,950
照亮
With the flame

344
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:52,370
天空
Of love

345
00:28:53,540 --> 00:29:01,380
我们是阳光
We are sunlight

346
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:08,510
也是月亮
Moonlight

347
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:24,610
明晚是满月
Tomorrow night will be the full moon

348
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,990
我带朋友们来一起庆祝
I can bring friends to bless our love

349
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,830
好的
OK.

350
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,750
带着纸折的龙和香水
With paper dragons and perfume

351
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,210
如果你愿意的话
If you want me to

352
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,630
- 龙？ - 对
- Dragons?  - Yes.

353
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,880
可以
Sure.

354
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,600
约翰，听见了吗？听着！
John, is that you, buddy?Listen to me

355
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:58,520
我现在特别激动，因为
Do I sound different? That's how it should be

356
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:02,690
因为昨晚，我度过了难忘的一夜
Last night, I spent a whole lifetime in paradise

357
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,570
告诉连长，把我的假期都调过来
Tell the CO I'm taking all of my leave

358
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,830
约翰，我们要去玩了，这感觉就像圣诞节
We're going to play house, John, it's like Christmas Eve

359
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:14,710
我们要连续狂欢四十八个小时
We have sworn we won't see the sun for 48 hours

360
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,250
你在说什么？你疯了吗？
What are you saying? Are you out of your mind?

361
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:20,630
所有的假期都取消了，以后再说不行吗？
All leave is canceled,you could be left behind

362
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,340
西贡现在已经支离破碎了
Saigon is falling apart and you'd better be here

363
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,800
把你们的手续都准备好！
Please have your papers ready!

364
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,550
在你找乐子的时候事情已经变化了
Here is the news since you've been on the moon

365
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,430
我们在森林外围的战区都失陷了
Cities in the boondocks are dropping like flies

366
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,770
家属和平民都要撤离了
Wives and civilians will be shipping out soon

367
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,730
使馆外面的人群拥挤，他们焦急万分
Crowds around the embassy have tears in their eyes

368
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,940
（译者注：指南越阮文绍政权）
南越政权的总统已经辞职，政府现在根基不稳！
Thieu has resigned, the new regime may not hold

369
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,440
人们聚集在使馆旁边期待我们陆战队的保护
People at the palace think we'll send the Marines

370
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:45,400
我们承诺的东西一样都没送到
We are sending nothing from what I've been told

371
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,700
- 老弟，你还在吗？ - 在！
- Buddy, are you there?  - Yes!

372
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:51,780
你听懂了吗？你可真会找节骨眼啊！
Do you know what that means? Sure, time to fall in love!

373
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:55,080
约翰！仔细听着，你没接过这个电话
John, listen fast,you did not get this call

374
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,870
毕竟是你把我领到那里的
You're the one who bought the girl for me, after all

375
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
既然你拿我当朋友，那就帮我帮到底
Once you are a friend, you're a friend through and through

376
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,550
我欠你个情，将来要还的
When you were in trouble, man, I covered for you

377
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:07,050
这次可不行！现在战事吃紧！可没时间理你那妓女！
Not this time, the town's too hot for one Kong whore

378
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:09,970
听我的伙计，我不会害你
OI' buddy, I will not get you killed

379
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:12,760
她可不是个妓女，你我都知道
She is no whore, all right? You saw her too

380
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:15,890
她更像是一轮，早春的明月
She's really more like... the April moon

381
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,730
- 早个什么他妈的月亮！ - 她的父母都死了
- April fucking moon?  - Both her parents died

382
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:21,360
她现在孤身一人
She was all alone, she was terrified

383
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,360
多感人的故事，专门忽悠你这样的人
Sweet as that and she's an orphan too How can a guy fight that?

384
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,690
你就只有一天假期，不是两天，快给我回来！
You've got one day, not two, then be back

385
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,780
- 克里斯先生，你迟到了  - 坏了！
- Monsieur Chris, you're late.  - Shit!

386
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,620
怎么了？她把你伺候了一晚上？
What, she kept you up all night?

387
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,750
虽然我们已经谈好了价钱
We had a deal for Kim, but that's on ice

388
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:40,620
但我必须遗憾的告诉你，我得涨价了
I'm sorry, Sergeant, but I've changed the price

389
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,000
你什么意思？
What do you mean?

390
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:45,050
我需要一张你们大使馆的通行证
I need a visa from your embassy

391
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,670
你只要把那个给我，这姑娘就归你了
Hey? You give me that, you get the girl for free

392
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,760
别扯没用的了，我只能给你钱
Look, cut the crap, this money's all I've got

393
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,390
我不是发卡的，你听明白了吗？
I don't give visas out, is this a deal or not?

394
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:56,100
- 听明白了吗？ - 啊，混蛋
- You tell me  - Ah, shit

395
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,810
- 好、好，给钱就行，给钱就行  - 成交
- OK, OK, the money, it will do  - Down

396
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:01,940
真倒霉，瞧，我还有一块瑞士手表，你也拿去吧
Too bad, I had a Rolex watch for you,it's yours, take it.

397
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,980
我再想想别的办法就好了嘛
I'll get my papers in another way.

398
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:09,240
我去找个有钱的大佬，你这混蛋！
I'll make a rich man of some attach, you asshole!

399
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,700
跟他耍点花样，然后骗他一票
With little shits like him, you take the bucks and run

400
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,950
他给了我六个礼拜的收入，我只需要一周的就够了
He gave me six weeks' income, I'll be gone in one

401
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,660
下次再让我见到你，我就废了你，你这混蛋！
I'll castrate you next time I see you, you little fuck.

402
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:29,210
我们当中的一个姑娘就要远行了
One of us girls is moving on

403
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:33,760
一个姑娘就要离开西贡了
One girl will get out of Saigon

404
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,050
她才是真正的西贡小姐
So look who's really Miss Saigon

405
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,310
她将离开这个不堪的生活
She'll leave this wasted life behind

406
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:41,520
她将不再只有连篇的幻想
She'll live the movie in my mind

407
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,640
我们到了
They're here!

408
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:46,230
- 嘘！ - 惊喜！
- Shh!  - Surprise!

409
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,480
看他给她买的新衣服
Look how he bought her a new dress

410
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,610
你肯定在他身上下了功夫
You did a job on him, I guess

411
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,950
他只是问我，我答应了
He simply asked me, I said "yes"

412
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,110
啊，真好
Yeah, right

413
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:58,080
来吧，祝福我们的新姐妹
Come on, let's bless the new princess

414
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,000
对，那就是我，行了
Yeah, that's me. Get off.

415
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,920
嘿！把鞋脱掉
Hey! Shoes off.

416
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:21,680
Dju vui vay

417
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,110

418
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:34,990
Dju vui vay

vao nyay moy

420
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:50,380
你是否会对我今后的生活微笑
Will you who gave me life smile today?

421
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:55,380
并且眷顾这个男人
Look with favoring eyes on this man

422
00:33:55,510 --> 00:34:01,430
从你极乐的国度降下仁慈和宽恕
Show your daughter's heart your forgiveness

423
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:07,150
从你极乐的国度降下仁慈和宽恕
And send to us from your home above

424
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:14,610
你祝福我们的爱
Your blessing on our love

425
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:19,830
Dju vui vay

426
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:23,370
Dju vui vay

427
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,920

428
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,880

429
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,300

00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,300

432
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:46,270
Dju vui vay

433
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:49,270
唱的真好听，是什么意思呢？
It's pretty, but what does it mean?

434
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,360
Dju vui vay

435
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,360
我们这里的姑娘在婚礼上唱的
It's what all the girls sing at weddings

436
00:34:56,490 --> 00:35:02,030
- 啥？ - 她们也不会什么别的歌了
- What?  - They didn't know what else to sing

437
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,040
vao nyay moy

438
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,290
这是我听过的最动人的歌声
It's the prettiest thing that I have ever heard

439
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,400
姑娘们！
Hey, girls!

440
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:36,190
- 为西贡小姐欢呼！ - 西贡小姐！
- To Miss Saigon.  - Miss Saigon!

441
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,280
你在这儿！
You're here, at last

442
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,580
终于找到你了，我带你回家
I've come to take you home

443
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:47,580
我在夜间偷偷穿过了封锁线
I hid all night, I tunneled through the line

444
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,460
小金，跟我走吧，一起逃离这个无耻的地方
Kim, come with me, we'll flee this shameful place

445
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,960
美国人完蛋了，我们胜利了，我们可以在一起了
They're done, we'll win, you're safe and you are mine

446
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:57,170
- 嘿！那姑娘是我的！ - 你的？
- Hey! This girl is mine  - Yours?

447
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,720
- 你是谁？ - 住手！
- Now who are you?  - Stop

448
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,430
这头美国猪是谁？
Who is this man, this American pig

449
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:04,810
跟你在一起的都是些什么人？
Who I now find with you in this place?

450
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,970
你为什么待在这个淫窝里？
Why are you here with these flea-bitten whores?

451
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,850
你也跟她们一样涂脂抹粉了吗？
Do you wear the same paint on your face?

452
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,230
- 滚开！ - 你现在不能呆在这里
- Get out!  - You have no right to be here

453
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,070
我不是你的物件！
I'm not a prize you can claim

454
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,740
我们虽然在十三岁定了亲
We were promised at 13

455
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,610
但是现在的我已经不是从前的我了
The woman I've become is not the same

456
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,700
我们的父亲给我们定的亲事
Our fathers bound us together

457
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,200
你为什么就不能等？
Why couldn't you wait?

458
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,740
你知道我一定会去找你，现在说这些太迟了！
You knew I'd come back to get you! It isn't too late

459
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:30,580
在你投奔北越的时候，我爹妈就死了
My parents got themselves killed in the week you changed sides

460
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:34,500
如果他们答应你了，那你现在去找他们吧！
If there were promises, all of them died when they died

461
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,170
别打扰我们了
Shaw's over, pal.

462
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:41,090
- 小金！你给我躲开！ - 到我身后！
- Kim, leave this man behind  - Stay here

463
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,720
你开枪吧！
No! Go on

464
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,510
开枪吧！
And shoot!

465
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,890
我意已决！
I will not change my mind

466
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,140
- 你还是我的  - 不再是了
- You are still mine  - Not anymore

467
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:55,940
- 我们至死不渝！ - 你躲开她！
- You're mine until we die  - Get off of her!

468
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:59,780
西贡完蛋了！
Saigon is doomed

469
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,200
你的大兵也完蛋了
And so is your GI

470
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,860
她会跟我走
She'll leave with me

471
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:08,450
你违背了你爹的承诺！
You broke your father's word

472
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:13,330
这就是你永恒的咒诅！
This is your curse

473
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,810
滚出去！
Get out!

474
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:39,070
派对搞砸了
What a party that was

475
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,700
你必须要离开了
You're going to leave me now

476
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,780
对，我是要离开
Yes, I'm going to leave

477
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:51,790
但是要带你一起走
And take you out with me

478
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,630
这地方不容我们去感受
In a place that won't let us feel

479
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,310
这生活不容我们寻找真实
In a life where nothing seems real

480
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,930
我找到了你
I have found you

481
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:19,020
我找到了你
I have found you

482
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,990
这个世界变幻莫测
In a world that's moving too fast

483
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:29,570
这个世界没有什么能够永恒
In a world where nothing can last

484
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,490
我会紧紧抱住你
I will hold you

485
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:37,330
我会紧紧抱住你
I will hold you

486
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:41,340
当明天来临，我们的生活会不一样
Our lives will change when tomorrow comes

487
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:46,300
今夜我们心跳如战鼓敲响
Tonight our hearts drown the beating drums

488
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,430
那我们就歌唱吧
And we'll have music, all right

489
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,970
歌声划破黑暗
Tearing the night

490
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,480
我们的歌声
Our song

491
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:01,270
只有一把孤独的萨克斯风
Played on a solo saxophone

492
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,480
尖戾的歌声
A crazy sound

493
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,820
寂寞的歌声
A lonely sound

494
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:13,790
哭泣的讲述着我们永不停歇的爱情
A cry that tells us love goes on and on

495
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:19,040
只有一把孤独的萨克斯风
Played on a solo saxophone

496
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:23,460
它告诉我要紧紧的和你相拥
It's telling me to hold you tight

497
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:31,090
如同在世界末日开始的舞动
And dance like it's the last night of the world

498
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:35,970
就在地球的另一边
On the other side of the Earth

499
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,520
你的生命将会不同
There's a place your life will have worth

500
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:44,070
我会带着你
I will take you

501
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,400
你会带着我
I'll go with you

502
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:50,660
你不会相信你所见到的！
You won't believe all the things you'll see

503
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:54,910
但我陪你看到的都是真实的
I know cos you'll see them all with me

504
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:00,330
如果我们在一起，我们就还会奏响
If we're together, that's when we'll hear it again

505
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,710
我们的歌曲
Our song

506
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,420
只有一把孤独的萨克斯风
Played on a solo saxophone

507
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,840
尖戾的歌声
A crazy sound

508
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,680
寂寞的歌声
A lonely sound

509
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:20,440
凄凉的讲述着我们永不停歇的爱情
A cry that tells us love goes on and on

510
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,480
只有一把孤独的萨克斯风
Played on a solo saxophone

511
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:29,740
它告诉我要紧紧的和你相拥
It's telling me to hold you tight

512
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:36,240
如同在世界末日开始的舞动
And dance like it's the last night of the world

513
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:40,460
我从没梦到过的美梦
Dreams were all I ever knew

514
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:44,040
有我就能成就的美梦
Dreams you won't need when I'm through

515
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:48,920
无论哪，我和你
Anywhere we may be

516
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:52,880
我都会与你相拥
I will sing with you

517
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:57,430
我们的歌曲
Our song

518
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,970
你去哪里？
Where are you going?

519
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:17,530
只有一把孤独的萨克斯风
Played on a solo saxophone

520
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:21,660
现在紧紧的和你相拥
So stay with me and hold me tight

521
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:25,790
如同在世界末日开始的
And dance like it's the last night

522
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:32,970
舞动
Of the world

523
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:43,410
听！它在悄悄的靠近
On silent feet it came

524
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:48,540
它有着烈焰的吐息
Breathing a sheet of flame

525
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,790
它来了！
It came

526
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,510
它带来猎杀的血腥
Closing in on its rightful prey

527
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,180
它的火焰要燃烧一个世纪
Burning a hundred years away

528
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:03,930
红色巨龙苏醒了！它散播着宇宙真理！
The morning of the dragon, truth lit up the street

529
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:08,650
真理如猛虎悄悄的接近
The tiger we were stalking walked on paper feet

530
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,230
它用火焰染红黎明的天际
And in the clear white heat of dawn

531
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:15,900
把政权夺取
Was gone

532
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,230
- 我们的枪声遍地  - 胜利！
- With guns from every shore  - Victory

533
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:54,520
- 人民军队的游击  - 胜利！
- The People's Army waged a war  - Victory

534
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:59,280
- 树林就是我们的阵地  - 胜利！
- Tunneling underneath the trees  - Victory

535
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,950
- 我们从暗处出击  - 红色巨龙的黎明！
- Bringing the giant to its knees  - The morning of the dragon

536
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:06,490
- 堡垒轰然倒塌  - 宇宙真理遍地开花！
- All the walls fell down  - Truth lit up the street

537
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,580
同志们好啊！
Brother greeted brother

538
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:11,870
真理如猛虎悄悄的接近
The tiger we were stalking walked on paper feet

539
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,590
- 那漫长的黑夜  - 它用火焰染红黎明的天际
- And in the endless night  - And in the clear white heat of dawn

540
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:18,840
把政权夺取
Was gone

541
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:25,640
- 听！它在悄悄的靠近  - 胜利！
- On silent feet it came  - Victory

542
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,100
- 它有着烈焰的吐息  - 胜利！
- Breathing a sheet of flame  - Victory

543
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:35,940
- 它带来猎杀的血腥  - 胜利！
- Closing in on its rightful prey  - Victory

544
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:40,530
- 它的火焰要燃烧一个世纪  - 属于红色巨龙的黎明！
- Burning a hundred years away  - The morning of the dragon

545
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:45,330
- 属于红色巨龙的黎明！ - 同志们好啊！
- The morning of the dragon  - Brother greeted brother

546
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:48,700
它如猛虎悄悄的接近
The tiger we were stalking walked on paper feet

547
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:52,960
- 那漫长的黑夜  - 它用火焰染红黎明的天际
- And in the endless night  - And in the clear white heat of dawn

548
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,750
把政权夺取
Was gone

549
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:01,420
收容教育三年好滋味
Three years of school was nice

550
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:04,260
在稻田里种地，汗流浃背
In rice fields, planting rice

551
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:09,100
你们好厉害啊！
You did good work, you see

552
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:13,020
劳动改造，重新做人
Re-educating me

553
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,810
靠谎言存在的，不改造就灭亡！
Who lives a lie must change or die

554
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:22,860
收容教育整三年，江山变色！
Three years, how quick they moved

555
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:26,740
世界在我眼前变了模样！
Look how the world's improved

556
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:30,950
西贡！罪恶之都！
Saigon, that queen of sin

557
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,080
现在她叫胡！志！明！
Renamed for Ho Chi Ming

558
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:38,250
靠谎言存在的，不改造就灭亡！
Who lives a lie must change or die

559
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:43,470
但是，人，终归是人
But men will always be men

560
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:45,430
他们觉得给我洗脑成功
They washed out my brain

561
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:47,140
可我还是我
I'm still what I am

562
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:51,350
我还是知道我能干什么
Deep inside, I know what I know

563
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:53,180
也知道我该去哪儿
Wherever I go

564
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:55,060
我现在嘴上喊“胡大爷”
I speak Uncle Ho

565
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:57,730
可心里还有“山姆大叔”
And think Uncle Sam

566
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:02,780
- 你叫陈万代？ - 听您吩咐！
- Your name is Tran Van Dinah?  - At your service

567
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,780
- 以前他们都叫你“工程师”？ - 是的长官！
- You're called the Engineer  - Yes, sir

568
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:10,660
- 我们的政委同志  - 我刑满了吗？
- The People's Commissar  - Am I free?

569
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:13,960
把你押送过来的
Has ordered you back here

570
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:18,210
靠谎言存在的，不改造就灭亡！
Who lives a lie must change or die

571
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,800
我们找到了你想要的这个人
We found the man that you wanted so bad

572
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,710
政委同志，您完全正确
And, Commissar, you were perfectly right

573
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,930
他正要被遣送的北边的劳改营
He had been taken up north to a camp

574
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:27,970
我们连夜把他解送回来
We brought him down under cover of night

575
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:29,930
他是亲美分子
Once he had served the American clique

576
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:31,970
靠出卖我们的姐妹发财
Selling our sisters and daughters for gold

577
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,930
不到一周我们就找到了他
Notice we caught him in less than a week

578
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:36,350
下命令吧！怎么处置他！
When we get orders, we do what we're told

579
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,230
好了，好了，就这样，可以了
All right, all right, that's it, that's all

580
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,440
你们干的不错，很好
You've done your job, that's it

581
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:51,240
你们走吧，我来审问他
You go back, I'll take over now

582
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,080
小金
Kim.

583
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:06,550
替我找到她
You will find her for me

584
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:11,680
好好给我想想
Crawl from under your shell

585
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:16,430
你知道她的朋友在哪
You know who her friends were

586
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:21,360
去，问问她们都知道什么！
Go! See what they can tell

587
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,690
挖地三尺把她找回来！
Sniff her out

588
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:26,400
否则
Or I swear

589
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:33,410
我会把你送进鬼门关
You'll look forward to hell

590
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:35,910
我再也没有见过她
I never saw her again

591
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,500
我已经被你们劳动改造了
I am a different man

592
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:42,210
我现在已经是社会主义新人了
I've been enlightened since then

593
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:43,710
实话啊……
Yes

594
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:49,510
啊，但是，帮个忙还是可以的嘛
But men must help other men

595
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:53,800
你放心吧，我一定全力寻找
And seeing it's you,I'll work to the bone

596
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,810
我给你四十八小时
I'll give you 48 hours

597
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:59,520
如果你还想活命，就把她给我带回来
If you want to stay free,don't come back here alone

598
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:06,900
- 听！它在悄悄的靠近  - 胜利！
- On silent feet it came  - Victory

599
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:12,660
- 它有着烈焰吐息  - 胜利！
- Breathing a sheet of flame  - Victory

600
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:16,740
- 它已准备好猎杀的血腥  - 胜利！
- Closing in on its rightful prey  - Victory

601
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:21,330
它的火焰要燃烧一个世纪
Burning a hundred years away

602
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,840
红色巨龙苏醒了！它散播着宇宙真理
The morning of the dragon,truth lit up the street

603
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,260
它如猛虎悄悄的接近
The tiger we were stalking walked on paper feet

604
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:33,890
它用火焰染红黎明的天际
And in the clear white heat of dawn

605
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:36,060
我们已经胜利
Was gone

606
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:59,760
昨晚我梦见你抱住了我
Last night I dreamed you held me

607
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:04,310
我们偎依在一起进入梦乡
We slept here side by side

608
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:09,730
你在我耳边低语
You whispered softly to me

609
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:14,360
轻声呼唤我的名字
I heard you speak my name

610
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:17,030
我哭了
I cried

611
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:21,620
纵然已经过去了好多年
Though I know it's been so many years

612
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:27,040
可我还是流下了泪滴
Through the silence of my secret tears

613
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:31,880
你还在我心中
You are here still

614
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:37,970
我依然
I still

615
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:42,930
依然相信
I still believe

616
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:47,520
你会回来
You will return

617
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:52,320
你会
I know you will

618
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:59,660
我的心依然为你而坚定
My heart forevermore holds still

619
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:04,830
依然坚定
Yet still

620
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:09,500
我依然相信
I still believe

621
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:17,130
永不心灰意冷的相信
I know as long as I can keep believing

622
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:19,430
我会活下去
I'll live

623
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:21,430
我会活下去
I'll live

624
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:23,890
真爱永生不熄
Love cannot die

625
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:25,730
你会回来
You will return

626
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:30,100
你会回来
You will return

627
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:37,280
只有我如此坚信
And I alone know why

628
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:43,990
昨夜我拥你入眠
Last night I held you sleeping

629
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:48,500
再一次受到噩梦侵袭
Again, the nightmare came

630
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:54,040
我听见你在喊着什么
I heard you cry out something

631
00:51:54,170 --> 00:52:01,140
听起来好像个人名
A word that sounded like a name

632
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:05,930
我突然感到了重重的一击
And it hurts me more than I can bear

633
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:11,060
至今有些事我不能向你提及
Knowing part of you, I'll never share

634
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:16,610
永远不提
Never know

635
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:22,110
但我依然
But still

636
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:27,370
依然相信
I still believe

637
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,920
终有一天我们信心坚定
The time will come

638
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:36,050
我再把你心扉开启
When nothing keeps us apart

639
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:43,340
我的心永远为你坚定
My heart forevermore holds still

640
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:45,010
- 小金！ - 没事了，没事了，我在这儿
- Kim!  - It's all over, I'm here

641
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:48,390
不要害怕
There is nothing to fear

642
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:52,480
克里斯，是什么让你如此恐惧？
Chris, what's haunting you?

643
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,770
跟我说说吧，没什么好怕的
Won't you let me inside? There is nothing to hide

644
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:03,570
是什么在噬咬着你？
What's hurting you?

645
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,450
- 我依然  - 我会一直抱着你
- For still  - I will hold you all night

646
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:07,620
你什么都不用担心
I will make it all right

647
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:11,960
- 我依然相信  - 我会守护你的安全
- I still believe  - You are safe with me

648
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,290
- 永远  - 我期待着你的倾诉
- As long  - And I wish you could share

649
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,000
- 永远  - 你隐藏了什么心事
- As I  - What you're hiding in there

650
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:21,050
- 永远不心灰意冷的相信  - 你承受了什么难言之隐
- Can keep believing, I'll live  - What your hell must be

651
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:24,510
- 等你回来，我会活下去  - 睡吧睡吧
- I'll live, you will return  - You can sleep now

652
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,640
- 你可以放声哭泣  - 我知道是什么原因
- You can cry now  - And I know why

653
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:31,390
- 我是你守伴一生的妻啊！ - 我是你的
- I'm your wife now for life  - I'm yours

654
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:38,690
生死相依！
Until we die

655
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:08,640
她叫小金，你见过她吗？
Kim? Have you seen this girl?

656
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,680
嘿，你
Hey, you

657
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:16,020
小宝贝儿！你还认得我吗！
Coo-coo, princess, look who's here

658
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:18,810
- 我是鬼门关里逃出来的工程师啊！ - 你怎么找到我的？
- Your resurrected Engineer  - How did you find me?

659
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:21,030
别一惊一乍，我就是顺藤摸瓜
Don't look surprised, I tracked you down

660
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:24,610
因为我的鼻子最灵啦！
I have the sharpest nose in town

661
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:29,780
我来是为了拉你一把
I'm here to throw a rope before you drown

662
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:35,000
因为，人，毕竟是人
For men will always be men

663
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:39,380
当官的虽然换了，可心思还是那么花
You change the regime, the lust doesn't stop

664
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:43,010
咱俩再度联手
You and I will team up again

665
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:47,050
联手从他们身上揩油
Together we'll reap the cream of the crop

666
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:49,850
工程师，我不想再见到你
Engineer, I don't want you here

667
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:53,100
你必须明白，我不能再做那种事了
I gave up that life, you must understand

668
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:56,600
我们出去！我们可以再狠捞一笔！
Just out there is a big shot who waits like a pup

669
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:59,230
吃香的喝辣的啊！小金！
To come up and eat out of your hand, Kim

670
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,980
荣华富贵又回来了
The good times are back

671
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:04,400
别说了，太晚了
Don't go on, it's too late

672
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:07,490
有你在就不晚！
Not too late for my star

673
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:12,950
- 求求你让我走吧  - 那我就得来硬的了
- Please let me hide in peace  - Better to screw the police

674
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:16,410
进来吧，政委先生
Come in, Monsieur Commissar

675
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:32,350
我离开了整三年
Three years I've been away

676
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:39,350
我们依然还相见
I kept faith we would meet

677
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,980
瞧见了吧？我找到她了
See? I found her for you

678
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,440
你外边站着去！
You, out in the street

679
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:47,360
出去！都出去！
Out! Get out

680
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:59,370
冥冥之中的安排
I knew in time, fate would weave a design

681
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:03,840
你和我终将生活在一起
Tying your life and mine into one

682
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,550
每天我翘首以盼
Each day I'd wait

683
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:08,590
就像一个战士
Like a soldier must wait

684
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:13,850
在漫长的黑夜中
Trusting victory to come with the sun

685
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:17,850
把黎明的胜利期待
After the fight in the still of the night

686
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:22,770
我的新娘啊！你将珠光宝气
I would picture my bride, bright as jade

687
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:26,900
我的新人啊！你的人生将大不一样
You'll be my wife, we will build a new life

688
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:32,610
完成你我父辈的诺言
And fulfill the vow our fathers made

689
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:37,120
父辈的诺言，不应如此实现
My father's vow can't be honored this way

690
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:41,790
我在内心的会祈求他的谅解
And I pray in my heart he'll forgive

691
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,590
你对我的要求，我不能答应
What you want now are some words I can't say

692
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:49,340
如果不在乎谎言，我大可委曲求全
If I lied to you, how could I live?

693
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:53,180
一个字都别再说了
Don't say any more, not a word

694
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,100
你不能这样，你得学会
You will change, you will learn

695
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:58,430
看着我
Look at me

696
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:05,770
给你时间考虑
Don't decide too soon

697
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:13,530
在我灵魂的深处
Somewhere deep in my soul

698
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:19,080
没有狂风的吹拂
Shines the smallest of lights

699
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,130
虽然希望的火苗微弱
And no wind blows it out

700
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:31,840
但是坚定而从容
It burns steady and strong

701
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:39,680
穿透漆黑的暗夜
Through the darkest of nights

702
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:46,940
Dju vui vay

703
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:52,570
yu doi my

704
00:57:55,740 --> 00:58:00,040
Dju vui vay

705
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:07,040
vao nyay moy

706
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:15,010
我许下了爱的誓言
I made a promise once with these words

707
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,430
无论天涯海角永不改变
Which neither time nor distance can change

708
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:22,310
他一定会回来找我
He will come to me still

709
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:25,810
你别傻了！你那个美国瘪三跑去过好日子了！
You must be mad, your American Jack has gone for good

710
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:27,770
他不会回来了
And he'll never come back

711
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:30,440
- 他跑了，小金！他把你丢下不管了！ - 不会！
- He ran away, Kim, he left you to rot  - No

712
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:32,860
我敢肯定他现在把你忘干净了
I'm sure by now he already forgot

713
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:36,280
小金你别傻了，心肝儿，你就别执迷不悟了
Kim, come on now, princess, get off of your cloud

714
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:38,660
实在抱歉啊长官，她太大声了
I'm sorry, sir, she was talking so loud

715
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:41,790
政委可是个很了不起的大官儿！
The Commissar is a powerful man

716
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:44,330
姑娘们都挤破脑袋要嫁给他们！
A girl with brains makes a life where she can

717
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:47,580
心肝儿，看看你现在
Princess, remember your place

718
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:49,710
可别让他丢了颜面！
Don't make people lose face

719
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:54,340
你为什么不看我？
Why do you look away?

720
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:58,050
我能结束你的痛苦不堪
I can end all this shame

721
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:01,220
你只要答应
All you need to say is "yes"

722
00:59:07,770 --> 00:59:08,980
小金！
Kim

723
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:24,700
- 听！它在悄悄的靠近  - 你听见外面那些当兵的了吗？
- On silent feet we came  - You hear those soldiers outside?

724
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:29,330
- 它有着烈焰吐息  - 他们都听从我的命令
- Breathing a sheet of flame  - They'll do whatever I say

725
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:32,250
它已准备好猎杀的血腥
Closing in on its rightful prey

726
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,210
我不会改变我的心意！
I cannot change what I feel

727
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:36,590
- 它的火焰要燃烧一个世纪  - 卫兵！进来！
- Burning a hundred years away  - Soldiers, come!

728
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:41,050
我让你在我眼前顺从我！
I think you will change before my eyes

729
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:45,430
我抓到了一个敌人溃败时
This Me-My has just been found

730
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:48,520
潜伏下来的奸细
She hid the day we closed the bars

731
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:51,360
看看她还知道什么
Show them that we don't forget

732
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,650
想毫发无损的背叛我们是不可能的
No one betrays us without scars

733
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:59,320
- 你是个无耻的女人！ - 你是敌人留下的余孽！
- You are a woman who lived without shame  - You're an infection left over from war

734
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:03,200
- 你玷污了国家的名声！ - 劳动改造或许能收拾你！
- You have dishonored the national name  - Re-education will cure the disease

735
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:07,160
- 拿你开刀，看看怎么惩治国家的蛀虫！ - 看我怎么收拾这个美国人的婊子！
- You must be shown what we do to a leech  - See how we teach an American's whore

736
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:09,460
我已经听够了惨叫
I have heard hundreds of speeches like these

737
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:11,670
求你们了，我再也不想听到惨叫了！
Take it from me, you don't want to hear more

738
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:14,630
动手吧！同志们！
It's time to act, my friends

739
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:16,630
现在！
It's time

740
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,340
她无耻至极！
Her face betrays her crime

741
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:21,720
她要付出代价！
She must pay

742
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:25,930
她的同党也一样！
And her partner too

743
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:27,430
住手！
Stop!

744
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:32,060
出去！
Get out!

745
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:34,310
我说，你们都出去！
I said, get out!

746
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:39,650
你就眼睁睁的看着他们宰了我吗？
Are you waiting for them to kill me?

747
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:41,490
你就不能照他说的做？
Did you not get what he said?

748
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:43,620
你脑子一定是已经坏掉
There's a big screw loose inside you

749
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,370
我来给你瞧瞧
I will rip it out of your head

750
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:47,660
那个家伙已经是一条疯狗
There's a mad dog on a rampage

751
01:00:47,790 --> 01:00:49,750
- 姑且顺服，大家都能满足！ - 不行！
- Just appease him, everyone wins  - No

752
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:53,630
我才不管你跟他会怎样！你就给我答应，咱们还能留条小命！
I don't give a shit if you love him, say you do, and we leave with our skins

753
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,300
我有我爱的丈夫！
I have a husband I love

754
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:58,550
他并不虚无！
Real as the sun in the sky

755
01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:01,170
- 我不能靠谎言苟活  - 你这傻瓜！
- I cannot live with a lie  - You stupid...

756
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,260
你不知道胳膊拧不过大腿吗？
Do you see now who has power?

757
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:05,350
你不要心存幻想
Do you still think crazy things?

758
01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:07,100
克里斯会从天而降
Chris will come to me like the phoenix

759
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:09,270
他会张开双臂带我走！
And he'll take me off on his wings

760
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:11,020
你这是背叛国家！
You're a traitor to your country

761
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:13,190
如果这是叛国，那你就动手吧！
If I am, then let it be

762
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:15,230
现在是你生死的抉择！
 I am talking of life or death now

763
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:17,480
我宁死也不跟你！
I am talking of staying free

764
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:21,280
好吧，我也没办法了，我滚出去了
So there it is now,I'll be moving on

765
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,410
如果你不需要我，我现在就消失
If you don't need me, I'd rather be gone

766
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:28,200
孤男寡女并不需要别人在场
Two kids in love don't need strangers around

767
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:30,950
- 你赶紧给我滚！ - 胡大爷万岁！我鸟悄的
- You, just get out!  - Ho Chi Ming, I won't make a sound

768
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:36,170
现在，就咱俩了
And as for you

769
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,090
- 跟我走吧  - 绝不！
- Come with me  - No!

770
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:48,430
我有个秘密
There is a secret

771
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:54,810
你并不知道
That you don't know

772
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:59,270
我有种力量
There is a force here

773
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:03,780
我从未显露
I never show

774
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:09,740
你说我背叛了
You say it's treason

775
01:02:09,870 --> 01:02:13,870
我爹的诺言
To keep my vow

776
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,920
可一年又一年
Season after season

777
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:23,590
我依然苟活
I've survived somehow

778
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:28,220
如果你想知道
If you want the reason

779
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:32,600
就给我仔细观瞧！
I will show you now

780
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,190
小天！
Tam!

781
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:43,940
没事的
It's OK.

782
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:58,000
看看，苏一，这就是我的孩子
Look, Thu, this is my son

783
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:05,090
他就是我的一切
He is all that I have

784
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:13,390
现在你知道我为什么一定要拒绝
Now you see why I must tell you "no"

785
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:22,730
别人没有必要看到你的这个孽种！
No one must ever see this thing you're showing me

786
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:24,650
你这混蛋毁了我的名声！
Your bastard fouls our name

787
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:28,240
无论我怎样，孩子是无辜的！
My baby's not to blame for what I've done

788
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:34,080
你现在必须选择你的立场！
You must decide upon which side you're really on

789
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:37,790
- 你这领着孽种的娼妇！ - 不要那样说我！
- You whores to have that kid  - No! That isn't what I did

790
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:39,330
别碰我的孩子！
Don't touch my son

791
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:43,840
你看这样行不行？
You must see how it is

792
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,670
就姑且嫁给我
When you're my wife

793
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:50,090
这孩子留着，就说是咱俩的
Keeping this child of his brands us for life

794
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:52,470
要是不这样，这孩子也就别活了？
No alternative, this child cannot live

795
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,470
不！
No!

796
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:57,930
我绝不会让你碰他
You will not touch him

797
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:01,900
- 别碰我的孩子  - 小金！
- Don't touch my boy  - Kim

798
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:05,980
他是我活下去的希望
He's what I live for

799
01:04:06,110 --> 01:04:11,490
我生命唯一的动力
He's my only joy

800
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:13,530
- 我绝不让你碰他！ - 他是阶级敌人！
- You will not touch him  - He is my enemy

801
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:15,370
就是他让你如此死心塌地！
It's he who turns you from me

802
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:18,040
- 别碰我的孩子！ - 我要把他抹去！
- Don't touch my boy  - Erase him from your life

803
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,620
忘掉他！
Even your memory

804
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:21,540
- 他是我活下去的希望  - 他只是你不该有的记忆！
- He's what I live for  - He's one drop in a flood

805
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:23,880
跟我走，给我生孩子！
Left here to taint our blood

806
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,510
- 他是我生命唯一的动力  - 我们的名分，是父辈的预定！
- He's my only joy  - Our marriage bond is sworn

807
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:28,010
忘掉这个孽种！
Forget that he was born

808
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:28,970
退后！
Get back!

809
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:30,930
你敢拿枪指着我？
Of course you have a gun

810
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:34,180
- 我绝不会让你碰我的孩子！ - 我可是你的叔伯兄弟！
- You will not touch my little boy  - And now you'll shoot your cousin

811
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,100
而且还是美国枪！
And it's a US gun

812
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:37,470
- 不要逼我！ - 美国已经完了！
- And do not test my will  - A gun that lost the war

813
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,350
你是反动顽固分子！
You're the corrupted one

814
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,270
- 我警告你！ - 来啊，开枪啊！别犹豫啊！
- I'm warning you  - Go on and shoot, don't wait

815
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:43,730
- 为了他我会扣动扳机！ - 就为了保护他这个孽种！
- For him I'll kill  - To save your bastard son

816
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:46,230
开枪！别犹豫！
You must not hesitate

817
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:47,900
我现在天旋地转
The earth moves where I stand

818
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:49,570
- 子弹推上了枪口  - 开枪啊！
- I feel the turning of a wheel  - Shoot

819
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:51,400
- 我手上只有这支枪！ - 开枪啊！
- I feel nothing in my hand  - Shoot

820
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:54,200
- 这支冰冷的枪！ - 开枪啊！
- Not even the chill of steel  - Shoot

821
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,330
我绝不会让你带走他！
You will not take my child

822
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:58,620
你根本就没杀过人！
You don't know how to kill

823
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:00,500
我别无选择
I have no other choice

824
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:04,500
我必须开枪！住手！
What I must do I will! No!

825
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:12,130
这是光荣的时刻啊！
This is the hour

826
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:17,810
我们伟大的祖国！
This is our land

827
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:23,650
我们伟大的力量！
We found the power

828
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:29,320
就在同志们手上！
In our brother's hand

829
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:34,280
暴风雨中！
And from a storm

830
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:40,500
- 不！ - 灯火闪耀
- No!  - Pierced with light

831
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:46,130
闪电撕开乌云
Fierce and white the lightning came

832
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:54,180
光芒把黑暗照亮
A brightening flame to end the night

833
01:05:55,220 --> 01:06:00,890
领袖在鼓舞着我们！
One man to heed us

834
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:05,850
无论你是男是女
Each girl, each boy

835
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:12,030
一个声音指引着我
One voice to lead us

836
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:17,620
伟大的战歌
In a song OTIOSE

837
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:23,120
这是庄严的时刻
This is the hour

838
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:30,340
这是我们伟大的祖国！
This is our land

839
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:56,200
如果你不想死于非命，那就看我怎么做
If you want to die in bed, follow my example

840
01:06:57,910 --> 01:07:01,700
乌云来了你得戴草帽啊
When you see a cloud ahead,it's time to show your class

841
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:07,540
当兵的来了赶紧猫下腰
Hit the door before they make a target of your ass

842
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:16,090
兵荒马乱命难活
If you want to die in bed in times of revolution

843
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:22,260
心中要有伟大的党啊，当你看到红旗飘！
When the flag they fly is red, let pride fill up your chest

844
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:28,520
抓住机会不要放啊！快往西边逃！
Meanwhile pack a sack and take the first boat heading west

845
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,240
哪去了？哪去了？
Where's it? Where's it?

846
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,990
啊，找到了
It's still here!

847
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:43,370
幸亏在舒坦的时候留了一手
My precious souvenirs of all the golden years

848
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:50,130
镀金的劳力士手表，挺像真的，啊？
Rolex watches in steel that look practically real

849
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:54,630
要想去曼谷东山再起，我得要点资金
I'll need a little stock to start me in Bangkok

850
01:07:56,970 --> 01:08:00,970
如果你不想死于非命，就别管天打雷劈
If you want to die in bed, forgot about your karma

851
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:07,180
当你命悬一线，就别怨天怨地
When your life hangs by a thread, don't cry about the fates

852
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:13,730
拿上一沓钞票，赶紧去美国溜之大吉！
Grab a stash of cash and buy a strip joint in the States

853
01:08:17,530 --> 01:08:21,910
等一下，这是我的珍藏
Let me stop for a bit, this was my greatest hit

854
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:28,120
西贡小姐的皇冠，谁得到它，谁就是城里的半边天
Miss Saigon in her crown, I made queen of the town

855
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:34,210
我拿它赚钱，姑娘们换了一遍又一遍
I got them paying more for just another whore

856
01:08:36,210 --> 01:08:41,510
我来了，美国
Here I come, USA

857
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:48,390
你的宠儿正在路上
Your next champ's on his way

858
01:08:49,810 --> 01:08:53,150
因为人总要活出个人样！
For men will always be men

859
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:55,440
到哪儿都一样
The rules are the same

860
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:57,480
不管皇帝还是草民
For kings or for clerks

861
01:08:57,610 --> 01:09:00,650
美元、法郎、日元，什么都行
Give me francs or dollars or yen

862
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:02,610
我就能重新开张
I'll set up a game

863
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:04,990
我知道该怎么干
I know how things work

864
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,580
脑瓜灵活的我为什么
Why was I born of a race

865
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:10,830
诞生在这个土里刨食的国家？
That thinks only of rice and hates entrepreneurs?

866
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:14,670
我！属于真正属于我的地方
Me, I belong in a place where a man sets his price

867
01:09:14,790 --> 01:09:17,210
你付钱，我就卖命
And you pay and he's yours

868
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,930
我应该是，美！国！人！
I should be American

869
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:26,890
生活在，那应许的土地！
Where every promise lands

870
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:31,940
每一个生意人都知道该去哪！
And every businessman knows where he stands

871
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:35,230
第一站，曼谷；第二站，罗马
First stop Bangkok, then I roam

872
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:39,940
然后漂洋过海
'Cross that ocean white with foam

873
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:47,160
来到我心中真正的家园！
To the place that's my heart's true home

874
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:50,660
美国啊！！
America

875
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:52,370
美国啊~~~~~
America

876
01:09:56,380 --> 01:10:00,840
如果你不想成为孤魂野鬼
If you want to die in bed en route to your Nirvana

877
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:04,630
你就必须牢牢抓住机会
You grab your chance and plunge ahead

878
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,680
去人人都能活命的地方
And go where people win

879
01:10:08,430 --> 01:10:09,680
天堂就在那里！
Heaven's there

880
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,940
但是，他妈的……
But shit...

881
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:18,520
你需要绿卡才能进去！
You need a visa to get in

882
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:19,650
噢！
Ah!

883
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:26,990
给我出去
Get out!

884
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,530
工程师，苏一死了
Engineer, Thu is dead

885
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:31,910
他想杀了我的儿子，我把他打死了
He was going to kill my baby and I shot

886
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:35,000
你说啥？那是谁？
You did what? Who is that?

887
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,210
你被盯上了，赶紧带他离开，再见！
You'll be followed, get him out of here, goodbye

888
01:10:37,330 --> 01:10:40,630
- 他妈的！ - 我和小天必须离开
- Fuck!  - We must leave, Tam and I

889
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:43,210
我们今晚必须去美国
We must set off for America tonight

890
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,260
好，完美的计划
All right, just like that

891
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:50,470
但是这怎么实现呢？
Tell me how and while you're at it, tell me why

892
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:53,980
我梦见了我的丈夫
I hear the voice of my soldier

893
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:57,230
他说他要见他的孩子
Telling me to bring his son

894
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:04,780
你说什么？这个混血儿是美国大兵的？
You're telling me this half-breed brat is born the son of a Marine?

895
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:08,410
让我看看他有没有美国大鼻子
Let me see his Western nose

896
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:13,660
这孩子长得太好看了！
This bastard is the most beautiful sight I've ever seen

897
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:17,290
我有美国护照了
A passport in my hand

898
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:21,380
我的新生活开始了
My new life can begin

899
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:26,050
你这美国少爷
Your brat's American

900
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:30,090
他们一定会让我移民
So they must let us in

901
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:36,940
在人间的乐园欢笑
In the playground of mankind

902
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:42,610
实现我多年的幻想
The movie in my mind

903
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:48,610
从现在开始，就说我是你的大哥
I'm your dear brother from now on

904
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:50,910
我们的家人都没了
And all our family is gone

905
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:54,120
孩砸！快亲亲你的陈叔叔
Boy, kiss your brand-new Uncle Tran

906
01:11:57,910 --> 01:11:59,790
这孩子真听话
This kid is OK

907
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:03,750
他就是我们通往
He is our entree

908
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:09,380
美国的通行证
To the USA

909
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:14,560
我只要把他俩紧紧抓在手里
With these two little diamonds to bait my hooks

910
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:19,640
我就能登上“豪华游轮人民号”
I'll book us on a cruise: "Boat people deluxe"

911
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:23,360
我以后就再也不害怕湄公河里的野兽了
Don't worry about sharks out in the Mekong Bay

912
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:26,440
毕竟找蛇头的风险太高了
The pirates taking us are more scary any day

913
01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:30,450
你待在这里藏好，千万别露面
You just stay here and hide, don't show your face outside

914
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:34,910
照看好这个小宝贝儿，我出去，“设计”一下
Take care of our little dear, I will go engineer

915
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:42,920
如果你不想死于非命
If you want to die in bed

916
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:46,420
就别想什么“民族大义”
Don't care too much for country

917
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:52,390
赶紧逃到海上
Hit the open sea instead

918
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:57,220
溜之大吉
And float there like a cork

919
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:58,730
为什么不呢？
Yeah, why not?

920
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:02,150
胡大爷！
Uncle Ho

921
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:05,190
胡…胡…胡…胡…胡…胡
Oh-ho ho-ho-ho...

922
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:09,070
胡大爷我就要去纽约啦！
I'll have to call you from New York

923
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:11,570
纽约~~哦~~！
New York

924
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:13,950
约哦~~！约哦~~！约哦~~！约哦~~！
New York

925
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:50,990
我的臂弯就是你的摇篮
You who I cradled in my arms

926
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:57,410
你从来不要求我什么
You asking as little as you can

927
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:06,000
真像个小大人儿
Little snip of a little man

928
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:11,510
我命中注定要做你的妈妈
I know I'd give my life for you

929
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:18,850
你突然就来到这个世上
You didn't ask me to be born

930
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:21,060
你
You

931
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:28,230
你为何要承受痛苦和挣扎
Why should you learn of war or pain?

932
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:33,320
我本应保护你免受苦难
To make sure you're not hurt again

933
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:39,830
我发誓我要用生命保护你
I swear I'd give my life for you

934
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:47,500
爱能摒除一切恐惧
I've tasted love beyond all fear

935
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:52,300
在那美好的夜晚，是爱把你带到了我身边
And you should know it's love that brought you here

936
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:55,510
在那美好的夜晚，是爱把你带到了我身边
And in one perfect night

937
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:58,550
那夜繁星璀璨
When the stars burned like new

938
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:02,810
我做了我该做的事
I knew what I must do

939
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:08,440
我给了你无限可能的人生
I'll give you a million things I'll never own

940
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:14,240
我带给了一个你将拥有的世界
I'll give you a world to conquer when you're grown

941
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:20,990
你将选择人生的模样
You will be who you want to be

942
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:28,080
你可以向命运索要赐予
You can choose whatever heaven grants

943
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:36,510
只要你能勇敢地活下去
As long as you can have your chance

944
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:40,680
我发誓我要用生命保护你
I swear I'll give my life for you

945
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:48,690
每当夜晚惊醒，我就会想他
Some nights I wake up reaching for him

946
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:52,110
他仿佛在床头偷偷的看我
I feel his shadow brush my head

947
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:56,860
醒来发现那只是斑斑的月光
But it's just moonlight on my bed

948
01:15:56,990 --> 01:16:00,030
他是真实的？他是虚假的？
Was he a ghost? Was he a lie?

949
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:03,620
他让我如此欢欣又如此忧伤
That made my body laugh and cry

950
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:08,580
当我彷徨，只有我们的骨血睡在我身旁
Then by my side, the proof I see, his little one

951
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:10,670
太阳上的神明啊！
Gods of the sun

952
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:18,010
把他带给我吧！
Bring him to me

953
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:23,470
你将选择人生的模样
You will be who you want to be

954
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:31,600
你可以向命运索要赐予
You can choose whatever heaven grants

955
01:16:33,150 --> 01:16:38,950
只要你能勇敢地活下去
As long as you can have your chance

956
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:43,620
我发誓我要用生命保护你
I swear I'd give my life for you

957
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:52,500
没人能阻止我要做的事
No one can stop what I must do

958
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:54,040
我发誓
I swear

959
01:16:54,170 --> 01:17:02,010
我要用生命守护你
I'd give my life for you

960
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:18,900
没有土地！没有家园！
No place, no home

961
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:23,200
没有生命！没有希望！
No life, no hope

962
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:26,910
没有可能！没有可能！
No chance, no change

963
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:31,210
- 不能反悔！不能回头！ - 没有土地！没有家园！
- No regret, no return  - No place, no home

964
01:17:31,330 --> 01:17:35,630
- 不能反悔！不能回头！ - 没有生命！没有希望！
- No regret, no return  - No life, no hope

965
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:40,260
- 不能反悔！不能回头！ - 没有可能！没有可能！
- No regret, no return  - No chance, no change

966
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:44,970
每一天！每一夜！
One day, one night

967
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:49,220
每一天！每一夜！
One day, one night

968
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:52,890
每一天！每一夜！
One day, one night

969
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:57,940
终有一天！
One day

970
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:27,070
他们是战争的遗孤
They're called Boi Doi

971
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:30,660
卑微有如尘土
The dust of life

972
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:37,960
在战场上孕育，在战乱中降生
Conceived in hell and born in strife

973
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:42,090
他们是活生生的见证
They are the living reminder

974
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:46,470
是被我们辜负了的见证
Of all the good we failed to do

975
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:54,600
我们无法忘怀，不能忘怀，他们如同我们自己的孩子
We can't forget, must not forget,that they are all our children too

976
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:06,860
曾经以为，我在战场上活下来，就不用辜负良心的谴责
Like all survivors, I once thought when I'm home, I won't give a damn

977
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:10,780
现在我终于知道
But now I know I'm caught

978
01:20:10,910 --> 01:20:16,200
我从未离开过越南
I'll never leave Vietnam

979
01:20:16,330 --> 01:20:20,420
对我们来说战争并没有结束
War isn't over when it ends

980
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:23,750
有些画面在时常提醒着我
Some pictures never leave your mind

981
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:27,050
那是孩子们的脸
They are the faces of the children

982
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:31,050
每一个我们留下的孩子
The ones we left behind

983
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:34,100
他们都是战争的孤儿
They're called Boi Doi

984
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:38,100
卑微有如尘土
The dust of life

985
01:20:38,230 --> 01:20:44,860
在战场上孕育，在战乱中降生
Conceived in hell and born in strife

986
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:49,280
他们是活生生的见证
They are the living reminder

987
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,660
是被我们辜负了的见证
Of all the good we failed to do

988
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:59,580
我们无法忘怀，不能忘怀，他们如同我们自己的孩子
We can't forget, must not forget, that they are all our children too

989
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:06,460
他们到处碰壁
These kids hit walls on every side

990
01:21:06,590 --> 01:21:09,170
他们不属于任何地方
They don't belong in any place

991
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:13,220
他们无法隐瞒
Their secret they can't hide

992
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:17,720
他们长了一张美国脸
It's printed on their face

993
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:25,110
我从没想到有一天我会为他们奔走呼号
I never thought one day I'd plead for half-breeds from a land that's torn

994
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:32,740
我无法忍受难民营中他们向外张望的目光
But then I saw a camp for children whose crime was being born

995
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:36,580
他们都是战争的孤儿
They're called Bi Di

996
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:39,660
卑微有如尘土
The dust of life

997
01:21:39,790 --> 01:21:46,290
在战场上孕育，在战乱中降生
Conceived in hell and born in strife

998
01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:50,710
我们欠他们一个父亲和一个家
We owe them fathers and a family

999
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,300
一个他们应得的家
A loving home they never knew

1000
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:57,300
因为在内心的深处
Because we know deep in our hearts

1001
01:21:57,430 --> 01:22:01,270
他们也是我们的孩子
That they are all our children too

1002
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:06,110
这是灵魂深处的渴望！
These are souls in need

1003
01:22:06,230 --> 01:22:09,440
他们渴望我们给于！
They need us to give

1004
01:22:09,570 --> 01:22:15,700
他们渴望机会，活下去
Someone has to pay for their chance to live

1005
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:19,240
- 伸出援手！ - 他们都是战争的孤儿
- Help me try  - They're called Bi Di

1006
01:22:19,370 --> 01:22:22,370
卑微有如尘土
The dust of life

1007
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:28,840
在战场上孕育，在战乱中降生
Conceived in hell and born in strife

1008
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:32,880
他们是活生生的见证
They are the living reminder

1009
01:22:33,010 --> 01:22:37,300
是被我们辜负了的见证
Of all the good we failed to do

1010
01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:40,510
- 所以我们知道  - 所以我们知道
- That's why we know  - That's why we know

1011
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:43,810
- 在我们的心中  - 我们内心的深处
- Deep in our hearts  - That deep down in our hearts

1012
01:22:43,930 --> 01:22:49,860
- 所以我们知道  - 他们都是
- That's why we know  - That they are all

1013
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:57,030
我们的孩子
Our children too

1014
01:23:20,050 --> 01:23:22,010
- 约翰！ - 克里斯！
- John.  - Chris!

1015
01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:26,850
- 还好吗？ - 约翰你太了不起了
- Look at you.  - John, you were great.

1016
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:28,770
我能单独跟你聊聊吗？
Can I see you alone?

1017
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:30,730
现在仔细讲讲电话里的事吧
I've got to know what you meant on the phone

1018
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:34,440
是什么消息？你只能告诉我？
Hey, what is this news you received you could only tell me?

1019
01:23:35,570 --> 01:23:40,620
我在曼谷的团队一直在给我传递消息
A lot of groups use my Bangkok staff to process problems on their behalf

1020
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:43,080
这是我在大使馆带来的信息
We got this in from the embassy

1021
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:46,370
我很难开口，你自己看看吧
It's not easy to tell you, it's best that you see

1022
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,500
小金，是关于小金的，对吗？
Kim. It's about Kim, isn't it?

1023
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:54,090
只有你知道我是多么难以启齿
Only you know how hard I have tried to get word

1024
01:23:56,550 --> 01:24:00,890
先告诉我，不要说别的，她还活着吗？
Tell me first, nothing else, tell me did she survive?

1025
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:08,190
你应该先看看，不过别担心，她，还活着
You should read the report, Chris, but yes, she's alive

1026
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:10,560
你不明白，约翰！你不明白！
You don't know, John, these nightmares

1027
01:24:10,690 --> 01:24:13,650
在夜里，我们见
The things that I've seen

1028
01:24:13,770 --> 01:24:18,030
我看到她葬身火海，看到她倒在我的枪下
I-I've seen her face burned, seen her shot with my gun

1029
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:24,580
我穿过了一条又一条的街道，听到的只有尖叫！
I've chased her through streets and heard nothing but screams

1030
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:30,330
怎么了？还有什么？说啊？
What's wrong? Come on, there is still something more

1031
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:35,840
她有了个孩子
She has a child

1032
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:39,470
是你的
You have a son

1033
01:24:51,770 --> 01:24:55,020
你也许不信，但是我已经梦到
You won't believe me, but I dreamed this, John

1034
01:24:55,150 --> 01:24:58,940
在梦里的西贡，我还真的梦到了他
He's in the nightmare when I see Saigon

1035
01:24:59,070 --> 01:25:01,820
- 天哪，约翰，我已经结婚了  - 我知道
- Jesus, John, I am married  - I know

1036
01:25:01,950 --> 01:25:05,120
这是真的吗？
Is this story for real?

1037
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:08,450
虽然这只是一条消息
I'm only telling you what I received

1038
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:11,370
但我的消息一般都很准确
But our reports can usually be believed

1039
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,710
小金现在曼谷的酒吧里
Kim's a bar girl in Bangkok

1040
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:16,880
兄弟我知道你现在的感受
Pal, I know how you feel

1041
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,550
这消息太迟了，我的人生已经重新开始了
It's too late! I have a whole new life

1042
01:25:19,670 --> 01:25:22,840
我有个我爱的妻子，她不能可有可无
I have a wife I love, she can't just disappear

1043
01:25:22,970 --> 01:25:25,100
听我说，克里斯，我知道你很震惊
Listen, Chris, I know the shock you've had

1044
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:28,140
也不一定是坏事，你看这样行不行？
It isn't always bad, there are solutions here

1045
01:25:28,270 --> 01:25:32,900
约翰啊，我从来没跟她讲过
John, I never told her

1046
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:37,650
我的妻子，我怎么跟他说？
My wife, how can I tell her?

1047
01:25:38,230 --> 01:25:42,530
有个孩子，怎么办？
A child, what can I do?

1048
01:25:42,650 --> 01:25:44,950
哦，老天，小金啊！
Oh, Jesus, Kim

1049
01:25:45,070 --> 01:25:46,120
我能怎么办？
What can I do?

1050
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:48,240
以前也有过这种事
I have learned the best thing for a couple to do

1051
01:25:48,370 --> 01:25:50,830
但我怎么和她开口？
How can I tell her?

1052
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:52,580
你俩一起去曼谷
You should both go to Bangkok

1053
01:25:52,710 --> 01:25:56,170
- 我又必须告诉她  - 没错，艾伦也去
- I have to tell her  - I mean Ellen too

1054
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:57,880
我俩？
Us both?

1055
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,340
你俩都应该去
You both should go

1056
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:03,340
嘿！小伙子们，来啊？
Hey, guys, come on

1057
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:07,970
但是首先，首先，艾伦要先知道
But first... First Ellen has to know

1058
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:10,430
怎么了？
What?

1059
01:26:12,850 --> 01:26:15,190
- 你还好吗？ - 不好
- Are you OK?  - No.

1060
01:26:15,310 --> 01:26:18,110
- 我们得谈谈  - 好的
- We need to talk.  - Sure.

1061
01:26:18,230 --> 01:26:20,070
过来吧，完蛋了……
Come on. Fuck.

1062
01:26:35,710 --> 01:26:38,590
- 曼谷最漂亮的姑娘！ - 盘儿靓条儿顺啊！
- Best girls in Bangkok  - Pussy galore!

1063
01:26:45,470 --> 01:26:49,890
- 注意啦！ - 嘿！你在那边干什么呢？
- Check it out!  - Hey, what are you doing there?

1064
01:26:50,010 --> 01:26:54,020
- 天天就知道游手好闲！ - 我会回去工作的，老板
- You're nothing but second-rate...  - I'll get back to work, boss.

1065
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:57,230
这婊子养的老板。嘿！找姑娘吗？要啥样的？
Son of a bitch. Hey, you looking for a girl? What can I get you?

1066
01:26:57,350 --> 01:27:00,150
大胸妹儿？嘿！老主顾！
You want a big-breasted girl? Hey, you're back!

1067
01:27:01,070 --> 01:27:02,820
我说过了，那姑娘干净极了
I told you that girl was clean.

1068
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:06,070
这次想玩儿点什么？男人婆吗？
What can I get you this time A girl that looks like a boy?

1069
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:08,780
还是换个人妖？还是这个跳舞的？
A boy who looks like a girl? Or someone who looks like this?

1070
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:11,330
多漂亮啊！
Yeah!

1071
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:17,210
- 姑娘们！ - 来吧台这边
- Girls  - Come to my bar.

1072
01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:19,210
- 我手上有姑娘  - 待会儿再谢我
- I got girls  - You'll thank me later.

1073
01:27:19,330 --> 01:27:23,130
- 动人的姑娘  - 幸亏没带老婆来
- Gorgeous girls  - I'm glad my wife's not here with me

1074
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:26,050
来，看看这个，看看这个姑娘，看她怎么样？
Check this out. Look at this girl. The way she moves.

1075
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:28,300
绝对能……你干嘛去？
It's impossible. You...

1076
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:31,850
浪费口舌
What a waste

1077
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,890
为了生存，我只能服服帖帖
To pay for my keep, I'm rounding up sheep

1078
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:39,440
为了在曼谷攒够钱
To fleece here in Bangkok

1079
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:44,530
我只能作践自己
I'm disgraced

1080
01:27:44,650 --> 01:27:46,070
我抓不住要领
I can't get ahead

1081
01:27:46,190 --> 01:27:50,320
因为曼谷对我来说毫不刺激
There's nothing as dead as peace here in Bangkok

1082
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:57,500
十美分一小时，他们出的也太少了
Ten cents an hour, that's the most they pay

1083
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:04,460
照这样，我只能游到美国
I'll have to swim to the USA

1084
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:07,760
姑娘大减价！买一送一
Special offer on pussies, buy one, get one free

1085
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:09,590
如果你想找点乐子，满足原始的欲望！
If you're looking for fun, original sin

1086
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:11,680
如果你觉得别处没趣，那你看看这里！
If you want to put out, then you've gotta come in

1087
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:13,180
- 姑娘们！ - 嘿！小伙子
- Girls  - Hey, boys

1088
01:28:13,310 --> 01:28:15,930
- 别像个熊包一样  - 给我来个姑娘！
- Don't stand around like wimps  - I got girls

1089
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:18,560
留神，那帮人是拉皮条的
Watch out, those guys, they're really pimps

1090
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:21,230
- 漂亮！ - 你想来点刺激的？
- Pearls  - You want some thrills?

1091
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,190
- 那就别犹豫  - 半价！
- Come on and grab it  - Half the price

1092
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:26,320
俩姑娘，一边一个
Two girls, a gerbil and a rabbit

1093
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:29,110
- 你够下流的，你喜欢那样？ - 嘿，过来
- Nasty stuff, you like that  - Hey, come to me

1094
01:28:30,490 --> 01:28:33,660
- 你看到了什么？ - 乒乓球！哈！
- Look what you'll see  - Ping pong, ha

1095
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:34,870
嘿，开个玩笑
Hey, that's a joke

1096
01:28:34,990 --> 01:28:37,500
顺便看看我吐烟圈的绝技
Mine blows smoke for a small extra fee

1097
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:44,920
嘿，老弟，来我这感受一下
Hey, Joe, try taking a little excursion

1098
01:28:45,050 --> 01:28:47,670
玩点不一样的你会更刺激
You'll all feel good from a little perversion

1099
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:51,340
- 哦，是吗？ - 先泡个澡，再来个马杀鸡
- Oh, yeah?  - Massage requiring total immersion

1100
01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:53,970
- 哦，对啊！ - 有些特别的地方
- Oh, wow!  - Some strange positions

1101
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:55,720
- 比如波斯  - 哦，不！
- They say are Persian  - Oh, no!

1102
01:28:55,850 --> 01:28:57,890
- 我可是摩门教徒！（译者注：早起摩门教可以一夫多妻）  - 酒水我买单
- I am a Mormon!  - Drinks are on me

1103
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:01,020
好！宝贝儿！去吧，第一个姑娘免费
Yeah, baby! Go! First girl is free

1104
01:29:02,230 --> 01:29:06,730
我还能说什么？这只是小小的营销手段！
Hey, what can I say? You get me for a small extra fee

1105
01:29:12,070 --> 01:29:13,530
对不起我摸错了！
It was only a joke.

1106
01:29:16,870 --> 01:29:20,080
你想要姑娘吗，先生？看看这个如何？
You want a girl, sir? You'll like one of these

1107
01:29:20,210 --> 01:29:23,000
小金在这儿？我能见见她吗？
You have a Kim here? Can I see her, please?

1108
01:29:23,130 --> 01:29:24,420
你先照看一下
You pick 'em well.

1109
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:27,420
约翰先生，是你吗？
Monsieur John. Is that you?

1110
01:29:29,170 --> 01:29:31,970
“工程师”？上帝啊，你也在？
The Engineer? Jesus Christ, you're here too?

1111
01:29:32,090 --> 01:29:33,260
哦，老伙计！
Oh, you

1112
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:36,140
在所有朋友里面，你是我最想念的那个！
Of all my friends, you're the one that I miss

1113
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:37,810
- 我在找小金  - 你爱死你了！
- I'm looking for Kim  - I love you so

1114
01:29:37,930 --> 01:29:39,470
还有那个叫克里斯的家伙
You and your buddy Chris

1115
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,440
我就是为他来的，小金的孩子
I'm here about him; Kim has a child

1116
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:43,150
- 生于  - 一九七五年
- Born in  - '75

1117
01:29:43,270 --> 01:29:46,770
我替你填好了
I filled that out, and it's you who arrive

1118
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:52,030
你现在离成功近在咫尺了
You'll find the end of your quest here in our little dive

1119
01:29:52,150 --> 01:29:54,990
伙计你太了不起了
Man, I'm impressed

1120
01:29:56,530 --> 01:30:00,120
美国人的办事效率真高啊
American clerks, a system that works

1121
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:03,620
- 高的真是没谁了  - 听着，没时间胡扯
- There's really no other  - Listen, spare me the gas

1122
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:05,830
她真的有孩子吗？
ls there really a child?

1123
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:07,960
哦，没错！我们得救了！
Oh, yes, we're blessed

1124
01:30:08,090 --> 01:30:12,670
小金现在有泰国身份了
And Kim's on a trip for citizenship

1125
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,430
我现在是她大哥
And I am her brother

1126
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:16,390
你是她哪门子大哥？
You're her brother, my ass

1127
01:30:16,510 --> 01:30:18,310
来吧，带我进去
Come on, take me inside

1128
01:30:29,270 --> 01:30:33,280
瞧瞧啊，小金，谁来了？
Look, Kim, who got our application

1129
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:37,160
我说过了，跟着我混准没错
I said I'd bring us all salvation

1130
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:40,200
哦天哪！约翰先生，一定是克里斯派你来的？
Oh, my God, Monsieur John, yes, of course he sent you

1131
01:30:40,330 --> 01:30:43,330
这儿不方便，这附近有能谈话的地方吗？
Not in here, is there someplace near we could talk?

1132
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:45,710
把你的手拿开，她下班了，去再找一个
Take your hands off, she's finished, go find someone else

1133
01:30:45,830 --> 01:30:49,880
跟我来，我有很多话，先听我说
Come with me, there's a lot I've got to say first

1134
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,880
克里斯来了吗？他来了吗？
Chris is here, say he's here

1135
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:54,050
哦，上帝啊，这是真的
Oh, my God, it's all true

1136
01:30:54,170 --> 01:30:59,140
我建议，交给我来处理
I suggest whatever may be, you leave this to me

1137
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:01,220
你照看好孩子
Just play little mother

1138
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:03,140
- 我必须搞清楚  - 我都知道
- What I need to find out  - Anything

1139
01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:05,230
让她单独跟我说
She can tell me alone

1140
01:31:08,810 --> 01:31:11,820
你带我去找克里斯，现在我能就离开
Can you take me to Chris? I can leave here right now

1141
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:14,030
- 是我们！ - 我们在这里待了好久
- We  - We've been here for so long

1142
01:31:14,150 --> 01:31:17,660
- 我只能靠这个谋生  - 在海上飘了一个月啊！
- I took this job to survive  - One month at sea

1143
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:19,870
我们几乎就要葬身海底
I was sure we'd drown

1144
01:31:19,990 --> 01:31:23,580
但是一想到克里斯，他就给我力量活下去
But I thought about Chris and we didn't go down

1145
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:27,210
虽然为了生存不得不卖笑，但是我们等到你来了
I've done terrible things, but we're safe and you're here

1146
01:31:27,330 --> 01:31:31,460
也许我的祈求终于得到了回应
So perhaps all the gods have begun to forgive

1147
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:36,340
那位先生点了香槟吗？
Has the gentleman ordered champagne?

1148
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:37,720
她给那位先生点的
She was about to get it

1149
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:40,510
你要么赶紧回去干活，要么就滚！
You'd better get back on the chain, or get out

1150
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:43,930
- 约翰先生  - 我真受不了这个老板了
- Monsieur John  - I am sick of that prick

1151
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:45,680
- 快点，在他发觉之前  - 跟我来
- Quick, before he gets wise  - Look at this

1152
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:48,900
去带他看看孩子，看看他的眼睑
Let John look at our kid, see the lids of his eyes?

1153
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:51,570
- 过来，孩子  - 让约翰见见
- Come see, love  - Let John have his surprise

1154
01:31:51,690 --> 01:31:56,030
- 我们去找你爹爹  - 再来一瓶！
- Come see Chris  - Open a bottle!

1155
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:03,950
看啊，山姆大叔，嘿！
Look, Uncle Sam, hey?

1156
01:32:04,950 --> 01:32:06,500
我就要成功了
How nice I am

1157
01:32:07,410 --> 01:32:10,330
我这么做完全是为了她的孩子
I'm doing all this just for Tam

1158
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:12,290
一个美国小子！
An American boy

1159
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:28,560
你看，约翰，这就是他的儿子
Look, John, this is his son

1160
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:34,400
- 来！击个掌！ - 看他俩笑起来是不是一样？
- Give me five.  - Don't they have the same smile?

1161
01:32:37,530 --> 01:32:45,160
他等他父亲的消息，已经很久很久了
He's been waiting for his father for a long, long while

1162
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:50,830
我这次来是公干
I'm not here as a friend

1163
01:32:51,290 --> 01:32:53,170
不是私人往来
I have a job to do

1164
01:32:54,340 --> 01:33:00,300
我现在为了孤儿们奔波，才来到了这里
It's strange to find my work should lead me here to you

1165
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:05,180
我把你的情况都告诉了克里斯
Chris knows all about you, I have shown him all this

1166
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:09,940
现在你该来了解一下克里斯的情况了
But I think that it's time you know all about Chris

1167
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:14,690
好啊，都告诉我吧，我等不及了
Yes, tell me everything, I beg you

1168
01:33:14,810 --> 01:33:17,900
经过漫长的等待
How I've longed for this to start

1169
01:33:18,030 --> 01:33:21,240
这些东西太多了
All my prayers are finally answered

1170
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:23,570
我怎么能看得完
This is too much for one heart

1171
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:27,830
小金，他失去你的时候几乎都疯了
Kim, he went crazy when he lost you

1172
01:33:27,950 --> 01:33:30,460
一整年都不开口说话
Spoke to no one for a year

1173
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:34,210
他说的第一句话就是，“我终于到家了”
Then he finally said, "I'm home now"

1174
01:33:34,330 --> 01:33:36,920
“我的人生要重新开始”
"My life has to go on here"

1175
01:33:37,050 --> 01:33:39,300
- 你在说什么？ - 小金啊
- What are you talking about?  - Kim

1176
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:42,550
请你先让我说完
Let me finish talking, please

1177
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:46,600
那是在三年前
That was three whole years ago

1178
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:49,890
是的是的，我知道
Yes, yes, I know

1179
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:53,480
孤单一个人的守候
I know how pain can grow

1180
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:58,980
两地分离的痛苦，越发与日俱增
When the rock you hold on to is a love miles away

1181
01:33:59,110 --> 01:34:00,740
听我说
Listen, please

1182
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:04,070
我知道你要说什么
I already know the story

1183
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:07,490
带我们去美国吧，约翰
Take us to the USA, John

1184
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:10,410
等我们都搞清楚了，你会见到他的
When we're finished here, you'll see him

1185
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:17,710
克里斯是和我一起来的
Chris arrived with me today

1186
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:21,090
哦，小天，他来了！
Oh, Tam, he's here

1187
01:34:21,210 --> 01:34:22,550
他来了，他如此接近
He's here, he's so near

1188
01:34:22,670 --> 01:34:26,010
我们今天呼吸着同样的空气
We might breathe the same air tonight

1189
01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:28,810
你的父亲来了
Your father's here

1190
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:32,270
- 我是如此的艰难  - 这让我怎么开口？
- I dreamed so hard  - I can't tell her like this

1191
01:34:32,390 --> 01:34:35,150
- 我坚守着这份信念  - 我这样岂不是做了坏事？
- I kept my faith  - I should not be the one

1192
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:39,900
- 现在如此的真切  - 克里斯必须先见到他的孩子
- And now it's true  - Chris must first see his son

1193
01:34:40,030 --> 01:34:42,280
- 现在我能感到  - 他们在档案上可没说
- Now I can see  - They don't say in the files

1194
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,740
- 我们终于等到了结局  - 她还如此坚定
- We've been watched over  - There's a woman in love

1195
01:34:44,860 --> 01:34:47,870
- 我们重获了新生  - 她还如此坚定
- And our life's about to start  - Here

1196
01:34:47,990 --> 01:34:49,740
- 她坚定的目光  - 太阳与月亮
- What I see in her eyes  - Sun and moon

1197
01:34:49,870 --> 01:34:52,000
- 终将在天空团聚  - 克里斯还不知道
- Will be together  - Chris don't know nothing of

1198
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:59,210
忽然要承受的如此之多
This is too much for one heart

1199
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:10,720
现在我只能做一件事
There's only one thing I can do

1200
01:35:10,850 --> 01:35:13,730
就是把克里斯带来见你
I must bring Chris here to see you

1201
01:35:13,850 --> 01:35:15,980
- 谢谢你  - 好
- Thank you.  - OK.

1202
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:18,150
我想我说过！孩子不能来这里
I thought I said no kids around

1203
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:21,230
那个小羔子在这里干什么？
So what's the brat doing here?

1204
01:35:23,230 --> 01:35:26,910
你最好给我小心点，我一直盯着你俩
You better take care, I'm watching both of you

1205
01:35:27,030 --> 01:35:30,030
你，和你那个工程师
You and your Engineer

1206
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:31,990
先森，你想按摩吗？
Sir, would you like a massage?

1207
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:34,040
不，谢了，不用了
No, thanks, it's not my scene

1208
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:36,410
我这里有男宠，就在笼子里
I can get boys from La Cage

1209
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:41,090
- 我没兴趣，快让开  - 看路啊！先森！先森！
- Whatever, man. Get out of my way.  - Watch out, sir! Sir!

1210
01:35:42,130 --> 01:35:43,920
他怎么走了？
Why is he leaving?

1211
01:35:44,050 --> 01:35:45,380
你笑什么？
What is that look?

1212
01:35:45,510 --> 01:35:46,760
他马上就要上钩了
He was right on the hook

1213
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:48,840
别告诉我说他已经开溜了
Don't tell me he slipped free

1214
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:51,470
工程师啊，克里斯来了
Engineer, Chris is here

1215
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:55,770
约翰回去把他带来
John is going to get him and bring him to me

1216
01:35:55,890 --> 01:35:58,480
我的心都快要跳出来了
My heart's ready to burst

1217
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:02,440
见到他我该先说什么？
I don't know what I'll tell him first

1218
01:36:02,570 --> 01:36:04,940
那家伙根本就不值得信任
That guy is no one to trust

1219
01:36:05,070 --> 01:36:09,320
否则那个大兵怎么刚知道他有个孩子？
Or a soldier who just learned he fathered a son

1220
01:36:09,450 --> 01:36:11,030
你先拖住克里斯
You got to get to Chris first

1221
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:14,580
在他脚底抹油之前，我先知道他住在哪
I will find his address now before he can run

1222
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:18,420
- 蠢货  - 他一定不会失信
- Stupid  - You can trust what he'll do

1223
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:23,800
- 我向你担保，你不用担心  - 你担保？
- Don't you worry, I'll mention you  - You'll mention me?

1224
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:27,550
别给我搞砸了，小婊砸，我不想节外生枝！
Don't screw with me, little bitch, I don't want any hitch

1225
01:36:27,670 --> 01:36:29,130
照我说的做！
You just do as you're told

1226
01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:32,260
你去他的住处
You go to his hotel

1227
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:33,680
我在背后运作
I'll be working as well

1228
01:36:33,810 --> 01:36:35,770
保住我们的摇钱树
Guarding our bag of gold

1229
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:40,350
无论你去哪里，我都跟随你
Tell me where and I'll go

1230
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:46,280
我知道他会一直呵护我
He'll be longing for me, I know

1231
01:36:47,610 --> 01:36:49,450
你带我走过电闪雷鸣
You have brought me through the lightning

1232
01:36:49,570 --> 01:36:52,410
你一直在远处守望着我
You have watched me from afar

1233
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:59,660
你会了解然后接纳我
You know all and you forgive me

1234
01:36:59,790 --> 01:37:03,000
我们会是好夫妻
Loving parents that you are

1235
01:37:07,010 --> 01:37:08,920
- 请你  - 你这傻姑娘继续吧
- Please  - Go on, talk to your ghosts

1236
01:37:09,050 --> 01:37:12,220
- 给我们未来的生活  - 继续向鬼魂祷告吧，你会失望的
- May your daughter have your blessing  - Little girl, till you're blue

1237
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:15,310
带来祝福
On the life about to start

1238
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:19,140
- 你只有一次机会，就一次  - 我们就要去往新的国度
- You have one chance, just one  - We must journey to a new world

1239
01:37:19,270 --> 01:37:24,650
- 他快来了，你要专心  - 我忽然要承受的如此之多
- He's here, talking to you  - This is too much for one heart

1240
01:37:24,770 --> 01:37:26,270
我来安排
I'll fix this

1241
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:28,110
你打扮漂亮点
Make yourself pretty.

1242
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:29,050
你以为我走远了吗？
Did you think I'd gone away?

1243
01:38:29,170 --> 01:38:35,800
我就是你手下的冤魂
I am the man you killed that day

1244
01:38:35,930 --> 01:38:42,140
冰冷的子弹射入了我的胸膛
Cold, with a bullet inside my chest

1245
01:38:42,270 --> 01:38:45,770
我的尸体虽然僵硬
My corpse may be sleeping

1246
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:50,900
但是我的鬼魂依然不宁
But my soul won't rest

1247
01:38:51,030 --> 01:38:54,360
我是你心中隐藏的罪恶
I'm the crime that you hid

1248
01:38:54,490 --> 01:38:59,580
你尽管尝试吧！但你永远也忘不掉你的所作所为！
You can try, but you'll never forget what you did

1249
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:06,540
在我这里你永远不会得到宽恕！
You will never be free

1250
01:39:06,670 --> 01:39:12,840
直到你再次来到我的身边！
Not as long as there's me

1251
01:39:14,420 --> 01:39:18,970
你以为你会逃过早已预定的命运吗！
Did you think you would escape the judgment that was planned?

1252
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:23,640
你以为你不会遭到报应吗！
Did you think you would escape the truth's avenging hand?

1253
01:39:23,770 --> 01:39:28,150
你以为逃出了越南就高枕无忧了吗！
Just because you have escaped the boundaries of your land?

1254
01:39:28,270 --> 01:39:30,020
我来了！
I'm here

1255
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:32,360
我来了！我永远不会消失！！
I'm here, I'm never dead!

1256
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:36,610
我来了！我就是你心里最阴暗的秘密！
I'm here, I am the guilt inside your head

1257
01:39:37,990 --> 01:39:44,330
你以为那个美国兵跟别人不一样？
You think your Marine's not like other men

1258
01:39:44,450 --> 01:39:46,500
他抛弃了你一次
He betrayed you once

1259
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:50,790
还会有第二次！
And he will again

1260
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:53,460
想想那天晚上
Think about that night

1261
01:39:53,590 --> 01:39:59,590
他最终回到了哪里！
Where was he back then?

1262
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:01,260
我带你逃出去，快跑！
I'm getting you out! Let's go!

1263
01:40:08,980 --> 01:40:11,190
对不起中士，形势恶化了
Sorry, Sergeant, as things degenerate

1264
01:40:11,310 --> 01:40:14,070
我给你的是全部的移民手续
All I'm giving her are her emigration papers

1265
01:40:14,190 --> 01:40:15,400
不能再等了！
Without the wait

1266
01:40:15,530 --> 01:40:16,900
- 在这里签名！ - 真他妈的！
- Sign here  - Bullshit

1267
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:19,070
然后她就能登上我们的航空母舰
This'll get her on board the carrier

1268
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:21,370
你必须确定即使到了美国
You're declaring that you will marry her

1269
01:40:21,490 --> 01:40:23,620
她依然是你的合法妻子
When you get back to the States

1270
01:40:23,740 --> 01:40:25,120
在这里签名，快点！
Sign here, come on

1271
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:27,250
根据总统的命令
By order of the old man

1272
01:40:27,370 --> 01:40:30,380
大使馆马上就关闭了
The embassy will close according to plan

1273
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:32,500
我给你多争取了一对夫妻的移民申请资格
I'll stretch a couple of rules to issue her pass

1274
01:40:32,630 --> 01:40:34,090
- 谢谢你！ - 那就对了，你准备好了吗？
- Thank you  - That's it, you're ready

1275
01:40:34,210 --> 01:40:35,920
坐稳了！你是下一个！
Nice ass, you're next

1276
01:40:36,050 --> 01:40:38,090
根据总统的命令
By order of the old man

1277
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:40,470
我们必须要处理好东南亚移民问题
We're processing the gooks as fast as we can

1278
01:40:40,590 --> 01:40:43,550
没错！就是越南！嘿！别让我发狠！
I mean Vietnamese, hey, don't get me wrong

1279
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:47,350
我不可能马上都把你们救走！去那边等着！
Can't save these looks for the Cong, right? Get in there

1280
01:40:48,770 --> 01:40:51,440
老天，我跟使馆打好招呼了，别磨蹭了
Christ, I'm due at the embassy, no time to lose

1281
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:53,900
我不想让你离开！
I don't want you to leave me today

1282
01:40:54,020 --> 01:40:56,650
至少战争拖延了几天让我们渡过了蜜月
Well, at least Uncle Sam bought our honeymoon cruise

1283
01:40:56,780 --> 01:41:00,320
- 如果你要走了，那我也和你一起走！ - 听我说，我把枪给你留下
- If you're going, I don't want to stay  - Look, I'm leaving my gun

1284
01:41:00,450 --> 01:41:03,700
- 趁着还有点时间，赶紧收拾！ - 我照你说的做
- We've got time, stay and pack  - I will do whatever you say

1285
01:41:03,830 --> 01:41:05,870
在敌人进攻前，我有好多话要对你说
I'll get plenty of word when the CC attack

1286
01:41:05,990 --> 01:41:09,250
你在屋里等着，直到我回来
I want you in that bed waiting when I get back

1287
01:41:09,370 --> 01:41:13,710
对不起中士！我们不能再拖延了，参谋部让我们赶快撤离！
Sorry, Sergeant, we must accelerate, State Department says we evacuate

1288
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:16,800
命令我们拂晓前离开这里
The word is, we must be out by dawn

1289
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:19,380
对不起中士！这是华盛顿下达的命令
Sorry, Sergeant, it's straight from Washington

1290
01:41:19,510 --> 01:41:21,510
现在起不能离开营地
No one leaves the grounds now, not anyone

1291
01:41:21,630 --> 01:41:24,600
物资都搬上飞机了，我们要走了！快走！
As fast as we load the planes, we're gone, go!

1292
01:41:25,470 --> 01:41:27,520
保持安静，不要喊叫
OK, keep quiet, don't shout

1293
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:30,440
在你们都撤离前，大使先生不会离开
The ambassador won't leave till everyone's out

1294
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:33,400
直升机已经上路了，足够们所有人乘坐
The choppers are on their way have room for you all

1295
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,820
他们在爬墙！
They're climbing over the wall

1296
01:41:35,940 --> 01:41:38,070
退后！退后！我说过了，不要大喊大叫！
Get back, get back, I tell you, don't shout

1297
01:41:38,190 --> 01:41:40,780
在你们都撤离前，大使先生不会离开
The ambassador won't leave till everyone's out

1298
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:43,990
大使命令我们丢下难民！
The ambassador just sent an order to freeze

1299
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:47,490
那就这样吧！越南人不要靠近！我们走！
That's it, no more Vietnamese, get in

1300
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:49,120
锁上大门！
Lock the gates

1301
01:41:49,250 --> 01:41:51,960
我是美军士兵的妻子，请让我过去吧！
I'm the wife of a soldier, please let me through

1302
01:41:53,460 --> 01:41:57,590
等一等！帮帮我！我要见你们的长官，我该怎么办？
Wait, help me, who must I pay? Tell me what I must do

1303
01:41:57,710 --> 01:41:59,510
- 克里斯！ - 让我出去！
- Chris!  - Let me out

1304
01:41:59,630 --> 01:42:02,220
- 不行！ - 那是我的新婚妻子！
- No!  - I've got to get back for my bride

1305
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:07,640
不要！听我说！我丈夫正在里面等我！
No, listen, someone, my husband is waiting inside

1306
01:42:09,390 --> 01:42:14,060
求你了，小金，接电话啊！
Please, Kim, hear the phone

1307
01:42:14,190 --> 01:42:16,650
我出不去了
I can't get there

1308
01:42:16,770 --> 01:42:18,860
你赶紧回家
Please be home

1309
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:21,610
再见了，克里斯
Please, Chris

1310
01:42:21,740 --> 01:42:26,740
没人发现我被丢在了这里
No one sees I am lost here

1311
01:42:26,870 --> 01:42:28,740
来找我吧，求你了
Find me, please

1312
01:42:28,870 --> 01:42:31,540
求求你！不管怎样！让我过去！
Please get me through, I don't care how

1313
01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:35,170
不要这样把她从我身边带走
Don't take my love away, not now

1314
01:42:35,290 --> 01:42:41,260
- 噢！克里斯啊！我被丢下了！ - 你要保重！
- Oh, Chris, I can't get free  - Please get free

1315
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:43,970
- 我依然和你在一起！ - 我永远和你在一起！
- Still I'm with you  - I am with you

1316
01:42:45,090 --> 01:42:48,350
等着我！
Wait for me

1317
01:42:48,470 --> 01:42:51,270
对不起中士，你必须进入使馆
Sorry, Sergeant, inside the embassy

1318
01:42:51,390 --> 01:42:54,600
我们正在突围争取时间
We are pulling out now and there will be no more reprieves

1319
01:42:54,730 --> 01:42:56,900
我会赶回来的！
I've got till the old man leaves

1320
01:42:57,020 --> 01:43:00,480
克里斯别胡闹了！大使现在就要离开了
Chris, don't be an ass! The ambassador is leaving now

1321
01:43:02,190 --> 01:43:05,070
- 带我走吧！ - 带上我的孩子！
- Take me with you  - Take my children

1322
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:07,820
- 我这里有证明！ - 我投靠了中情局
- I have a letter here  - I helped the CIA

1323
01:43:07,950 --> 01:43:10,490
他们会把我们都杀光！
They'll kill who they find here

1324
01:43:10,620 --> 01:43:13,120
不要丢下我们不管！
Don't leave us behind here

1325
01:43:13,250 --> 01:43:15,540
我的妻子已经离开了
I've a wife who left already

1326
01:43:15,670 --> 01:43:17,080
我在纽约有亲戚！
I have an aunt in New York

1327
01:43:17,210 --> 01:43:18,540
我有钱，要多少！
I have gold, I can pay

1328
01:43:18,670 --> 01:43:20,880
这里将会尸横遍野
There is no one to find here

1329
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,550
不要丢下我们不管
They have left us behind here

1330
01:43:23,670 --> 01:43:26,300
我必须进去！来人啊！听我说！
I must get in there, listen, anyone

1331
01:43:26,430 --> 01:43:28,430
请你告诉我的丈夫，看，这是他的枪
Please tell my husband, look, I have his gun

1332
01:43:28,550 --> 01:43:30,430
不要僵持了！让开！
Out of my way if that's all that you've got

1333
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:33,310
越共来了我们会被处决！
If I am here when they come, I'll be shot

1334
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:37,600
让我过去约翰！我不能离开她！
Let me go, John, I can't leave her

1335
01:43:37,730 --> 01:43:40,940
我谁都不要！就要她！
Why in the world should I be saved instead of her?

1336
01:43:41,070 --> 01:43:43,530
越共会把我们都杀光！
They'll kill who they find here

1337
01:43:43,650 --> 01:43:45,610
不要把我们丢下！
Don't leave us behind here

1338
01:43:45,740 --> 01:43:48,700
- 让开！ - 你疯了！战争非常残酷！
- Get off!  - It's not you, it's war that's cruel

1339
01:43:48,820 --> 01:43:51,660
让他们希望破灭也许是更好的出路
And if some dreams get smashed, perhaps it's best they were

1340
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:54,250
这里将会尸横遍野
There is no one to find here

1341
01:43:54,370 --> 01:43:56,660
不要丢下我们不管
They have left us behind here

1342
01:43:56,790 --> 01:43:59,330
醒醒吧朋友！我不能让你这么胡来！
Wake up, my friend, your mercy trip has failed

1343
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:01,710
现在已经无济于事，撤离的船已经开走了
There's nothing you can do, that ship has sailed

1344
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:04,210
她并非唯一一个我们丢下的人
She's not the only one we'll have betrayed

1345
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:07,220
快去屋顶，要不就完蛋了
Get to the roof or else we are betrayed

1346
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:10,890
哦，克里斯！
Oh, Chris

1347
01:44:11,010 --> 01:44:13,680
我仍然相信
I still believe

1348
01:44:13,810 --> 01:44:19,100
你的心，仍然和我连在一起
The heart of you is here with me

1349
01:44:19,230 --> 01:44:27,240
我将抓住一切机会，不会放弃！
My heart against all odds holds still

1350
01:45:32,430 --> 01:45:34,930
金！
Kim!

1351
01:46:40,450 --> 01:46:42,460
求求你！
Please!

1352
01:47:39,390 --> 01:47:44,770
你是阳光
You are sunlight

1353
01:47:44,890 --> 01:47:48,560
而我是月亮
And I, moon

1354
01:47:49,190 --> 01:47:54,900
被命运眷顾
Joined by the gods of fortune

1355
01:47:56,280 --> 01:48:01,660
在子夜和正午
Midnight and high noon

1356
01:48:02,700 --> 01:48:06,330
共享着天空
That's what we are

1357
01:48:07,330 --> 01:48:10,790
就在那一夜
How in one night

1358
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:17,130
我们突然分隔天涯
Have we come so far?

1359
01:48:18,510 --> 01:48:25,430
外边，天将破晓
Outside, day starts to dawn

1360
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:31,980
长长的噩梦终于要结束
One long nighttime has gone

1361
01:48:32,110 --> 01:48:33,860
你如此靠近
I feel you near

1362
01:48:33,980 --> 01:48:35,570
我们如此接近
I reach your place

1363
01:48:35,690 --> 01:48:37,490
我知道你就在这
I know you're here

1364
01:48:37,610 --> 01:48:39,950
我能摸到你的脸
I touch your face

1365
01:48:40,070 --> 01:48:47,080
我们的爱，重新绽放
And our love is reborn

1366
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:07,310
我们爱情的火焰
Brightening the sky

1367
01:49:07,430 --> 01:49:09,810
把天空
With the flame

1368
01:49:13,150 --> 01:49:16,190
照亮
Of love

1369
01:49:17,570 --> 01:49:21,410
我们就是
Made of

1370
01:49:21,530 --> 01:49:26,160
阳光
Sunlight

1371
01:49:26,290 --> 01:49:33,040
和月亮
Moonlight

1372
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:41,050
金！小金！
Kim. Kim.

1373
01:49:41,180 --> 01:49:43,260
我找到克里斯了，就在这间宾馆
I've found Chris. He's at this hotel.

1374
01:49:43,390 --> 01:49:46,430
去吧！我照顾小天，这回别搞砸了！
Go! I'll take care of Tam. Don't screw this up.

1375
01:49:47,430 --> 01:49:48,270
太棒了！
Yes!

1376
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:17,040
噢！
Oh!

1377
01:50:17,170 --> 01:50:20,510
- 对不起  - 不用换床单，谢谢
- I'm sorry.  - Don't turn the bed yet, thank you.

1378
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:25,840
- 我不是服务员  - 哦？那么，有什么事吗？
- I'm not the maid.  - Oh. Well, how can I help you?

1379
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:29,680
- 这是三一七房？ - 是的
- 317?  - Yes.

1380
01:50:29,810 --> 01:50:31,680
克里斯多夫·斯科特的房间？
Christopher Scott's room?

1381
01:50:32,890 --> 01:50:37,110
哦，天哪，我知道你是谁了
Oh, God, I see. I know who you are.

1382
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:41,190
你一定是小金
You must be Kim

1383
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:45,320
克里斯去找你了
Chris went to find you

1384
01:50:45,450 --> 01:50:48,120
请进来
Please come inside

1385
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:50,580
我没有恶意
No one will hurt you

1386
01:50:51,950 --> 01:50:54,330
我是克里斯的妻子
I'm Chris's wife

1387
01:50:55,210 --> 01:50:56,750
我是艾伦
My name is Ellen.

1388
01:51:13,890 --> 01:51:17,650
其实，我是想先见你一面
In a way, I'm glad I'm meeting you first

1389
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:23,610
在这之前，我只听过你的名字
Understand, you were only a name till tonight

1390
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:29,200
我很难想象，咱俩互换位置会什么样
I don't know how I'd feel if our roles were reversed

1391
01:51:31,830 --> 01:51:34,080
这不是真的！
Tell me you are lying

1392
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:37,790
我们结婚已经两年了，这是真的，对不起
We've been married two years, I'm sorry, it's true

1393
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:40,670
- 他说他会来找我  - 他说他尽力去找你了
- He said he'd come to get me  - He said he tried to reach you

1394
01:51:40,790 --> 01:51:44,800
- 但是他无能为力  - 求你跟我说，这都不是真的！
- But what could he do?  - Please tell me you're not married

1395
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:48,180
你不知道！你无法知道！为了今天我付出了什么！
You don't know, you can't know what I've done to be here

1396
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:50,970
你也理解不了他为什么需要新生活
You don't know how he needed a new start

1397
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:54,520
我全部的希望啊！
I feel walls in my heart closing in

1398
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:58,730
我无法呼吸，我不能相信！
I can't breathe, I can't win

1399
01:52:01,070 --> 01:52:03,860
你的孩子，你说他是克里斯的
And your child, you say it's Chris's

1400
01:52:05,650 --> 01:52:10,660
是的，女士，我的孩子就是克里斯的
Oh, yes, madame, my son is Chris's

1401
01:52:11,370 --> 01:52:14,540
我的孩子不应该过那种生活
I had a dream for my son to belong

1402
01:52:14,660 --> 01:52:17,160
那种过街老鼠一般的生活
Not live his life in the street like a rat

1403
01:52:17,290 --> 01:52:20,330
我们虽然不富裕，但是我们能尽一切力量帮你们
We aren't rich, but we'll give what we can

1404
01:52:20,460 --> 01:52:24,050
我们俩已经谈好了
Chris and I are totally together on that

1405
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:26,970
那你就把小天带走吧
Then you must take Tam with you

1406
01:52:27,090 --> 01:52:29,260
把孩子从母亲身边带走？不可能，小金
Take a child from his mother? Impossible, Kim

1407
01:52:30,050 --> 01:52:32,100
你必须带小天走！
You must take Tam with you

1408
01:52:32,220 --> 01:52:34,430
那样他就能过上我许诺的生活！
Then he'll get what I wanted for him

1409
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,770
但是小金啊，孩子需要妈妈
But, Kim, your child needs you

1410
01:52:36,890 --> 01:52:39,440
我和克里斯的婚姻里，需要一个我们的孩子
Chris is married to me, we want kids of our own

1411
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:42,770
小天跟你们在一起才能过好！
Tam's chance lies with you now, not with me

1412
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:45,780
- 求你了！ - 不！这不行！
- Please  - No, it won't work

1413
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:49,530
他是你的孩子，不是我的！
He's your child, he's not mine

1414
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:53,200
你这样说，是因为你不是他！
If you're saying that because you made him change his mind

1415
01:52:53,330 --> 01:52:56,700
他不会离开我和他的孩子！
Chris must go away and leave me and his son behind

1416
01:52:56,830 --> 01:52:59,920
我的丈夫现在成了别人的丈夫！
If you're saying that because my husband has another wife

1417
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:04,090
我的孩子就这样命如尘土！
My child has no future like the dust of life

1418
01:53:04,210 --> 01:53:08,840
克里斯今晚来找我，我让他当面的跟我说！
Chris must come tonight to my place, tell me so to my face

1419
01:53:08,970 --> 01:53:10,760
小金！小金！
Kim! Kim!

1420
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:16,220
克里斯……
Chris

1421
01:53:16,350 --> 01:53:18,020
你现在为什么不在这
Why aren't you here now?

1422
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:24,480
我弄不明白，我现在需要你
I don't understand, I really need you here

1423
01:53:25,570 --> 01:53:27,110
求你了
Please

1424
01:53:28,110 --> 01:53:30,950
求你帮我
Please, help me

1425
01:53:33,620 --> 01:53:36,540
我是否一直在骗自己
Am I fooling myself

1426
01:53:36,660 --> 01:53:41,750
是不是我已经失去了你
If I've already lost you?

1427
01:53:43,290 --> 01:53:45,840
不，不会的，你还是我的
Nothing's changed, you're still mine

1428
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:51,180
我们可以试着忘了这些
We can try to ignore this

1429
01:53:52,340 --> 01:53:56,930
但是如果她回到了你的生命里
But if she has come back in your life

1430
01:53:57,060 --> 01:54:03,850
也许，你就不再属于我
Well, then maybe you were never mine

1431
01:54:03,980 --> 01:54:10,530
我的心在狂啸
And yet my heart cries maybe

1432
01:54:10,650 --> 01:54:13,160
这说不通，这不对劲
It's a trick, it's a lie

1433
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:18,990
她只是在利用你
She's just trying to use you

1434
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:21,370
但我从她的眼神里知道
But I looked in her eyes

1435
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:26,170
失去你她会失去一切
It could kill her to lose you

1436
01:54:26,290 --> 01:54:30,170
或许
And maybe

1437
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:36,600
你需要的是她
Just maybe you need her, too

1438
01:54:37,550 --> 01:54:41,930
我们认识的时候，你已经颓废不堪
Back when we met you were broken and wild

1439
01:54:42,060 --> 01:54:47,020
我整夜抱着你入眠，当你哭喊我也痛苦万分
And I held you at night and I ached when you cried

1440
01:54:47,150 --> 01:54:51,440
但是我们排除万难，努力重获新生
But despite what we lacked we tried staying on track

1441
01:54:51,570 --> 01:54:53,990
我不后悔
No regret

1442
01:54:55,530 --> 01:55:02,330
也许
Yet maybe

1443
01:55:02,450 --> 01:55:10,050
是命运把她交还给你
It was fate that suddenly brought her back to you

1444
01:55:10,170 --> 01:55:17,800
在我们认识之前，她就比我更懂你
And your love was true love before I even knew you

1445
01:55:17,930 --> 01:55:23,980
你想要的生活应该由她来给予
If the life of your dreams is the life she is giving

1446
01:55:24,100 --> 01:55:31,610
你们之间的感情，我是否应该退出去
Should I be the one to stop your dream from living?

1447
01:55:31,730 --> 01:55:39,580
如果你是她的，那就跟她去，将我遗忘干净
If you're hers, then be hers and forget about me now

1448
01:55:39,950 --> 01:55:42,040
原来我一直没有看清
I've been blind for so long

1449
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:46,960
也许我现在应该相信
But perhaps I can see now

1450
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:50,420
也许
And maybe

1451
01:55:50,540 --> 01:55:54,760
仅仅是也许
Just maybe

1452
01:55:54,880 --> 01:56:02,350
我该坚强的放开手让你随她去
I'll find the strength I need to set you free now

1453
01:56:02,470 --> 01:56:04,640
我会坚强，我不会哭泣
I'll be strong, I'll stand firm

1454
01:56:04,770 --> 01:56:10,440
我将不会流下泪滴
So my tears won't betray me

1455
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:14,900
但我的心会碎落满地
But my heart might just break

1456
01:56:16,820 --> 01:56:20,240
也许
If what may be

1457
01:56:20,370 --> 01:56:27,370
也许
May be

1458
01:56:44,930 --> 01:56:46,810
我们到处都找不到她
We couldn't find her anywhere

1459
01:56:46,930 --> 01:56:49,230
亲爱的，怎么了？
Honey, what's wrong?

1460
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:51,810
小金来过了，我全都告诉她了
Kim was here; the one who had to tell her was me

1461
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:57,860
哦，天哪，我们去的太久了
Oh, my God, I knew we were gone too long

1462
01:56:57,990 --> 01:57:01,410
不，我觉得我这么做是十分正确的
No, I think it's exactly what I had to see

1463
01:57:01,530 --> 01:57:04,030
你说你只是和她同居
You said you slept with her, that's all you were

1464
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:08,040
但你忘了一件事情，那就是你爱的是她！上帝啊！
Only one thing you left out is that you loved her, God

1465
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:10,540
是的，我们有过感情，但那是好几年前了
Yes, we were in love, but it was years ago

1466
01:57:10,670 --> 01:57:12,250
我们分开了
We were torn apart

1467
01:57:12,380 --> 01:57:14,630
别解释了，那没用！
Don't explain, there's nothing you can say

1468
01:57:14,750 --> 01:57:18,510
她差不多就快崩溃了，她要把孩子给我们
It's like she's gone insane, she tried to give away her own child

1469
01:57:18,630 --> 01:57:20,260
- 艾伦  - 你刚才不在
- Ellen  - You weren't here

1470
01:57:20,380 --> 01:57:22,470
她的眼睛透露了一切，难道你看不出来吗？
I saw the look in her eyes,don't you see?

1471
01:57:22,590 --> 01:57:23,930
她认为你们有婚姻
She thinks she is married to you

1472
01:57:24,050 --> 01:57:25,510
- 什么？ - 你必须亲口跟她否认
- What?  - You must tell her she's not

1473
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:28,850
她必须亲耳从你嘴里听到，当然，前提是这都是真的
She must hear it from you! Course, it only depends if it's true

1474
01:57:28,980 --> 01:57:32,020
嘿！别胡说了，艾伦！
Hey, don't you doubt me, Ellen

1475
01:57:32,150 --> 01:57:34,150
你是我妻子！
You're my wife

1476
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:39,240
那么多士兵在战场上丢了性命
Lots of guys came back and had no life

1477
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:41,820
而且遇见了你
I had you

1478
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:44,740
嘿
Hey.

1479
01:57:45,740 --> 01:57:49,540
你随便怎么说，她都给你生孩子了
You can say what you want but she's borne you a son

1480
01:57:49,660 --> 01:57:50,910
艾伦
Ellen

1481
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:55,630
你做噩梦的时候喊的是她的名字
In your nightmares, the name that you shouted was hers

1482
01:57:55,750 --> 01:57:58,090
- 我知道  - 你都结婚两年了
- I know  - You've been married two years

1483
01:57:58,210 --> 01:58:01,010
你从来没对我这样
But not shared things you've done

1484
01:58:01,130 --> 01:58:02,590
- 我很抱歉  - 不许！
- I'm sorry  - Don't

1485
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:05,760
不许！别回头！
Don't, don't hold back

1486
01:58:05,890 --> 01:58:09,020
看着我！
Let me see

1487
01:58:09,140 --> 01:58:13,940
你选择她，还是我！
Is it her now or me?

1488
01:58:26,660 --> 01:58:28,790
让我告诉你都发生过什么
Let me tell you the way it was

1489
01:58:30,660 --> 01:58:33,330
当我还是从前那个我
Back when I was a different man

1490
01:58:33,460 --> 01:58:38,380
当时我不知什么是对，什么是错！
Back when I didn't have a clue what was right

1491
01:58:40,630 --> 01:58:44,090
他们把我拖上了船，拉到了越南
They drafted me and shipped me out

1492
01:58:44,220 --> 01:58:49,010
参加了一场荒谬的战争
To wind up in that senseless fight

1493
01:58:49,140 --> 01:58:55,520
在那里，那场艰难的战争里
There, in the shambles of a war

1494
01:58:55,650 --> 01:59:01,070
我找到了我一直在找的
I found what I was looking for

1495
01:59:01,190 --> 01:59:04,360
残垣断壁的西贡，只有她才是真实的
Saigon was crazed, but she was real

1496
01:59:04,490 --> 01:59:10,910
曾有那么一刻，我感觉到
And for one moment I could feel

1497
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:17,170
一个截然不同的世界
I saw a world I never knew

1498
01:59:17,290 --> 01:59:21,670
从她的眼睛里，我感受到了痛苦与折磨
And through her eyes, I suffered too

1499
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:25,380
上帝啊！在那场肮脏的战争里
God, in spite of all the things that were

1500
01:59:25,510 --> 01:59:31,310
她是我唯一的寄托！
I started to believe in her

1501
01:59:31,430 --> 01:59:34,810
所以我要救她，保护她
So I wanted to save her, protect her

1502
01:59:34,940 --> 01:59:36,310
上帝啊！我是个美国人
Christ, I'm an American

1503
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:39,270
我怎么能心安理得！
How could I fail to do good?

1504
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:43,570
我知道我做的一团糟，我们都搞砸了
All I made was a mess, just like everyone else

1505
01:59:43,690 --> 01:59:48,870
我们根本没想到在那种地方不可能有奇迹发生
In a place full of mystery that I never once understood

1506
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:52,410
我只是想逃离战争
I wanted back a world I knew

1507
01:59:52,540 --> 01:59:55,830
重新和你一起生活
The story of my life began again with you

1508
01:59:55,960 --> 01:59:58,750
我现在知道了了
It's all right now

1509
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:01,090
- 不要再说了  - 不，艾伦，我还要告诉你
- That's all through  - No, Ellen, I should have told you

1510
02:00:01,210 --> 02:00:06,630
- 我们重新开始，忘掉这些  - 你能相信我吗？
- We'll get past this, start anew  - Will you ever trust me again?

1511
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:12,930
- 我生命里真正需要的  - 我生命里真正需要的
- All I want in my life now  - All I have in my life now

1512
02:00:13,060 --> 02:00:17,770
就是你
ls you

1513
02:00:17,890 --> 02:00:20,230
嘿，你俩还好吗？
Hey... YOU guys OK?

1514
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:25,070
小金来过了
Kim was here.

1515
02:00:26,950 --> 02:00:28,660
天哪，她自己吗？
My God, alone?

1516
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:32,330
是的，在我们出去的时候
Yeah, while we were out looking for her.

1517
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:38,620
- 我需要回避吗？ - 不，不用
- You need some time?  - No, we're OK now.

1518
02:00:40,670 --> 02:00:43,000
你们讨论过那个孩子了？
Have you discussed Tam?

1519
02:00:46,460 --> 02:00:47,420
那么
Look...

1520
02:00:48,510 --> 02:00:52,680
我探访了一个难民营，里面全是战争遗孤
I run a camp that is filled with Boi Doi

1521
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:56,220
他们都在寻找自己的父亲
Looking for the fathers that they may never find

1522
02:00:56,350 --> 02:00:59,390
我不禁想，如果小天是我的孩子该怎么办
I don't know what I'd do if Tam were my boy

1523
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:02,020
你们想带他走还是把他留下？
Do you want to take him out or leave him behind?

1524
02:01:02,150 --> 02:01:04,690
他是我的孩子，我不会抛弃他
He's my son, I won't abandon him

1525
02:01:04,820 --> 02:01:08,360
除了他，上帝啊，还有小金也一起带走
Except that, Jesus Christ, John, there is also Kim

1526
02:01:08,490 --> 02:01:09,910
怎么样？
What of her?

1527
02:01:10,030 --> 02:01:13,740
如果仅仅是孩子，那就带上吧
If it were only Tam we'd take him now

1528
02:01:13,870 --> 02:01:17,700
他是克里斯的孩子，怎么都好说
He's Chris's son, we'd make it work somehow

1529
02:01:17,830 --> 02:01:20,620
但是，约翰啊，她心里还是有他
But, John, she still loves him

1530
02:01:20,750 --> 02:01:23,170
怎么都不方便啊
How can we have her there?

1531
02:01:23,290 --> 02:01:25,840
那就这样，别无选择
There's no choice, I think the answer's clear

1532
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:28,760
就让他俩都待在曼谷，我们资助他们
They'll have to stay in Bangkok, we'll support them here

1533
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:30,470
我觉得这样行
I think this is the answer

1534
02:01:30,590 --> 02:01:33,390
你没搞清楚她是怎么想的
You didn't see what's in that girl's head

1535
02:01:33,510 --> 02:01:36,310
- 截至目前，我觉得这样可行  - 我希望你们仔细想想
- For now, this is the answer  - I hope you're both proud

1536
02:01:36,430 --> 02:01:38,270
你们出的这个办法
Of what you've just said

1537
02:01:38,390 --> 02:01:40,730
- 就这样？ - 就这样！
- Is it done?  - It's done

1538
02:01:40,850 --> 02:01:42,690
就这样决定了
It's planned

1539
02:01:42,810 --> 02:01:46,610
小金不笨，她会明白的
Kim is smart, she'll understand

1540
02:01:46,730 --> 02:01:48,440
你必须带走小天
You must take Tam with you

1541
02:01:48,570 --> 02:01:51,200
我们会把他送到美国开的学校
In Bangkok, he will go to American schools

1542
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:54,240
我不想违背我许给他的诺言
I won't break my promise to my son

1543
02:01:54,370 --> 02:01:57,200
- 他会开始新生活  - 你必须带走小天
- He will start a new life  - You will take Tam with you

1544
02:01:57,330 --> 02:01:59,330
- 这样不行！ - 我们提供他们生活所需
- It's not right  - We'll provide for their needs

1545
02:01:59,450 --> 02:02:00,910
你俩太单纯了
You're both talking like fools

1546
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:04,080
你不会忘了小天是你的亲骨肉
You won't forget Tam is a part of you

1547
02:02:04,210 --> 02:02:05,790
我们这样肯定行！
We will do what is right

1548
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:07,590
对小天好
Right for Tam

1549
02:02:07,710 --> 02:02:09,970
对我们好
Right for us

1550
02:02:10,090 --> 02:02:14,260
对小金也好
And for Kim

1551
02:02:15,470 --> 02:02:22,640
我依然感受到你的温存
I still taste your kisses

1552
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:32,320
你的声音在我耳畔萦绕
Your voice sings in my ear

1553
02:02:32,450 --> 02:02:38,160
即使你能忘掉我们的曾经
You can betray what we were yesterday

1554
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:44,420
你今晚也一定会来接走孩子！
But you'll come back tonight for him

1555
02:02:55,550 --> 02:02:56,850
嘿！小金
Hey, Kim

1556
02:02:59,390 --> 02:03:03,060
拜托，拜托，记住我教给你的
Come on, come on, your recitation

1557
02:03:03,180 --> 02:03:06,560
跟他们诉诉苦
Describe your reconciliation

1558
02:03:06,690 --> 02:03:09,940
在他发觉上当之前
I hope, before his stimulation

1559
02:03:10,070 --> 02:03:13,150
我们三个就能远走高飞了
He bought our little group vacation

1560
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:18,410
他做梦都是梦到我们的孩子
In all his dreams he saw our baby

1561
02:03:18,530 --> 02:03:21,910
他教他如何用纸
And he's teaching him to fly

1562
02:03:22,040 --> 02:03:24,660
折出纸龙，放飞上天
Paper dragons in the sky

1563
02:03:24,790 --> 02:03:27,170
对，是，纸的，但是别忘了现在的状况
Yes, papers, what's the situation?

1564
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:30,880
我们得拿到移民用的绿卡
We'll need our cards for immigration

1565
02:03:32,050 --> 02:03:35,590
别耍花样！我可是手眼通天！
No tricks, I've got my reputation

1566
02:03:35,720 --> 02:03:38,680
别给我装疯卖傻
Don't want no phony complication

1567
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:42,350
不会，不会
No, no

1568
02:03:42,470 --> 02:03:45,480
他今晚会来
He's coming to us tonight

1569
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:48,520
打好你的行装，安排好你的事情
Pack your things, get yourself arranged

1570
02:03:48,650 --> 02:03:52,730
我将准备好我最后要做的事情
While I change for my last performance

1571
02:03:52,860 --> 02:03:54,320
噢，那我打包啦！
Oh, I'll pack.

1572
02:03:54,440 --> 02:03:58,870
我，克里斯和你，这是什么套路啊！
Me, Chris and you? Yeah? What a menage!

1573
02:04:01,120 --> 02:04:03,580
曼谷，去你的吧！
Bangkok can screw

1574
02:04:03,700 --> 02:04:05,160
开始旅行吧！
bonbon voyage!

1575
02:04:05,290 --> 02:04:07,460
我要去美国了
I'm going to America!

1576
02:04:08,580 --> 02:04:10,250
我马上就要抽这支雪茄啦
I'm gonna smoke you soon.

1577
02:04:15,420 --> 02:04:18,470
我老爸在海防是个纹身师傅
My father was a tattoo artist in Haiphong

1578
02:04:20,390 --> 02:04:24,470
但是他在我妈身上可没浪费多少技术
But his designs on Mother didn't last too long

1579
02:04:26,100 --> 02:04:29,150
我妈妈出卖肉体，不停地嚼着槟榔
My mother sold her body, high on betel nuts

1580
02:04:29,270 --> 02:04:30,730
哦…
Oh...!

1581
02:04:31,860 --> 02:04:37,400
而我就负责把那些乡巴佬都领过来
My job was bringing red-faced messieurs to our huts

1582
02:04:37,530 --> 02:04:40,450
推销自己的老妈虽说是个悲剧
Selling your mom is a wrench

1583
02:04:40,570 --> 02:04:43,700
可香水却能遮盖臭气
Perfume can cover a stench

1584
02:04:43,830 --> 02:04:47,790
法国人都这么干
That's what I learned from the French

1585
02:04:51,960 --> 02:04:55,800
后来奠边府那边大不如前了
Then it all changed with Diem Ben Pu

1586
02:04:57,220 --> 02:05:00,840
- 法国蛤蟆回了老家，别人又来啦？ - 谁啊？
- The Frogs went home; who came?  - Guess who?

1587
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:05,680
我们都发疯了，但不要吃惊
Are you surprised we went insane

1588
02:05:07,810 --> 02:05:11,350
因为美元像雨一样落下来了
With dollars pouring down like rain?

1589
02:05:13,020 --> 02:05:15,650
生意人从来不会来硬的
Businessmen never rob banks

1590
02:05:15,780 --> 02:05:18,820
因为我就算卖屎都能获得个好名声
I can sell shit and get thanks

1591
02:05:18,950 --> 02:05:23,660
至于这个嘛，美国人都是这么干哒
Now, that's what I learned from the Yanks

1592
02:05:24,910 --> 02:05:30,080
我的人生并不忙碌
I'm fed up with small-time hustles

1593
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:34,630
因为我的聪明，全用来赚钱啦
I'm too good to waste my talent for greed

1594
02:05:36,710 --> 02:05:42,680
我想找个地方放松下筋骨
I need room to flex my muscles

1595
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:47,640
一条大鱼在大海里才能满足
In an ocean where the big sharks feed

1596
02:05:48,680 --> 02:05:50,850
成全我吧！美国佬！
Make me Yankee

1597
02:05:50,980 --> 02:05:53,230
你们才是我的家人
They're my family

1598
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:59,860
我们都是贩卖梦想的行家！
We're selling dreams people need

1599
02:06:04,620 --> 02:06:07,410
空气里是什么味道？
What's that I smell in the air?

1600
02:06:08,660 --> 02:06:11,500
就是美国梦啊！
The American dream

1601
02:06:14,670 --> 02:06:18,420
未来的百万富翁
Sweet as a new millionaire

1602
02:06:19,420 --> 02:06:22,300
就是美国梦啊！

1603
02:06:24,970 --> 02:06:27,600
粉墨登场吧！
Pro-packed and ready to wear

1604
02:06:27,720 --> 02:06:31,100
我的美国梦啊！
My American dream

1605
02:06:33,850 --> 02:06:36,440
就像拿起蛋糕
Fat like a chocolate eclair

1606
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:41,610
一口吸出奶油一样甜蜜
As I...suck out the cream

1607
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:44,740
来啊！西贡小姐！
Au reservoir, Miss Saigon

1608
02:06:46,950 --> 02:06:49,160
我准备好了！
I'm moving on

1609
02:06:50,160 --> 02:06:52,790
抓住这个转瞬即逝的机会
Grab what you can till it's gone

1610
02:06:52,910 --> 02:06:56,830
我的美国梦啊！
The American dream

1611
02:06:58,090 --> 02:07:00,920
阴险的中国人毁了我的好日子
Greasy Chinks make life so sleazy

1612
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:05,130
到了美国，我要办一个四星级的俱乐部
In the States,I'll have a club that's four-starred

1613
02:07:05,260 --> 02:07:08,810
像我这种人在美国一定吃得开
Men like me there have things easy

1614
02:07:08,930 --> 02:07:12,810
我要聘一个律师，还要一个保镖
I'll have a lawyer and a bodyguard

1615
02:07:12,930 --> 02:07:18,270
做着生意，玩儿着漂亮妞
To the johns there, I'll sell blondes there

1616
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:23,240
这一切只要刷卡就行啦！
That they can charge on a card

1617
02:07:23,700 --> 02:07:25,660
刷刷
Th k-ts k!

1618
02:07:28,160 --> 02:07:32,500
哦，空气中的味道，那是……
Oh, what's that I smell in the air?

1619
02:07:32,620 --> 02:07:35,000
我的美国梦啊

1620
02:07:38,790 --> 02:07:42,510
豪华的就像总统套房
Sweet as a suite in Be Air

1621
02:07:42,630 --> 02:07:46,130
我的美国梦啊！

02:08:38,190 --> 02:08:40,480
啤酒一口喝干
Schlitz down the drain

1636
02:08:42,480 --> 02:08:44,400
再开一瓶香槟

现在我们都来狂欢吧！我的美国梦啊！

给你们的干爹一个吻吧！

来吧，小天，勇敢的孩子

漫长的等待结束了
Our long wait has ended

1684
02:12:57,110 --> 02:13:05,080
笑一笑，孩子，你马上就有父亲了

他来接你回家

1686
02:13:10,580 --> 02:13:15,590
接你到那个我一直跟你说的地方

1687
02:13:15,710 --> 02:13:17,760
你永远是我的孩子
You're still mine

1688
02:13:17,880 --> 02:13:19,630
我不会自己苟活
But I can't go along

1689
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:25,010
不要悲伤，我会一直照看着你，就在那遥远的地方
Don't be sad; though I'm far away, I'll be watching you

1690
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:31,600
这是别离的时刻
This is the hour

1691
02:13:31,730 --> 02:13:36,030
我终于等到了
I swore I'd see

1692
02:13:36,150 --> 02:13:40,860
漫长的等待
I alone can tell now

1693
02:13:40,990 --> 02:13:43,990
注定的结局
What the end must be

1694
02:13:45,910 --> 02:13:49,410
他们为你选定命运
They think they'll decide your life

1695
02:13:50,540 --> 02:13:55,130
我将把它交给你
No, it will be me

1696
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:12,060
孩子，再看我一次吧
Look at me one more time

1697
02:14:15,150 --> 02:14:18,530
记住妈妈的模样
Don't forget what you see

1698
02:14:18,650 --> 02:14:20,530
妈妈再亲你一下吧
One more kiss

1699
02:14:26,660 --> 02:14:32,210
我们将永远分离
And then say goodbye

1700
02:15:30,510 --> 02:15:31,770
金！
Kim!

1701

小金啊！上帝啊
Kim! Oh, my God!

1702
02:15:50,740 --> 02:15:53,370
你为什么要这么做啊！
What have you done, Kim?

1703
02:15:54,500 --> 02:15:55,870
为什么！
Why?

1704
02:15:57,960 --> 02:16:03,630
神明已经把小天带给了你
The gods have guided you to your son

1705
02:16:05,260 --> 02:16:08,050
上帝啊！
Oh, Jesus!

1706
02:16:10,300 --> 02:16:13,100
求求你，不要死！
Please, don't die

1707

我抱住了
I've got you.

02:16:58,600 --> 02:17:03,110
就在那一夜
How in one night

1711
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:09,820
我们如此接近
Have we come so far?

1712
02:17:13,530 --> 02:17:15,160
嘿！
Hey.

1713
02:17:18,330 --> 02:17:20,880
