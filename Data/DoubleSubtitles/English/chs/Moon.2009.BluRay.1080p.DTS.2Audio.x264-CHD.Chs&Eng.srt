[■我们现在居住在哪]

5
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,060
能源即污染的状况已经持续一段时间了
There was a time when "energy" was a dirty word.

6
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,770
开灯与否也曾经是个艰难选择
When turning on your lights was a hard choice.

7
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,730
城市里的灯火管制…
Cities in brownout...

8
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,740
食物短缺 车辆靠吞油而行
food shortages, cars burning fuel to run.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,780
但这些都已成往事
But that was the past.

10
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,820
我们现在在哪 是如何使这个世界如此多娇
Where are we now? How do we make the world so much better?

11

连沙漠都能迸发蓬勃生机
Make deserts bloom!

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,910
此刻 我们就是世界最大的混合能源生产商
Right now, we are the largest producer of fusion energy in the world.

13
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,580
太阳能投射到月岩 被其所捕获
The energy of the sun, trapped in rock,

14
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,130
再由月球远端的机器所开采
harvested by machine from the far side of the moon.

15
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,760
今日 地球所需能源总量的百分之七十可由…
Today, we deliver enough clean-burning helium-3...

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,510
我们开采的清洁能源氦-3所供给
to supply the energy needs of nearly 70% of the planet.

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,810
当时谁会想到 我们急需的能源
Who would have thought that all energy we ever needed

18
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,600
其实抬头可见
is right above our heads?

19
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,350
月能
The power of the moon...

20
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,110
我们明日的能源
the power of our future.

21
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:06,300

我得出去把能源罐弄进来
I'm going to go out now and rope her in.

33
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,130
好的 山姆
OK, Sam.

34
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,690
我想来点巧克力
I want chocolate.

35

依我看 你够肥了
I think you're sweet enough.

36
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,020
别吃的好
You don't need chocolate.

山姆・贝尔 呼叫指挥中心

41
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,040
太平洋时间十点十四分
10:14, Pacific Time.

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,510
有一能源罐已采满氦-3 准备回送
I have a full container full of helium-3, ready to roll.

43
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,430

三年是个漫长的旅程

52
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,290
你知道 那可是相当相当相当相当的漫长
You know? It's way, way, way, way, way too long!

53
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,460
我在习惯性地
I'm talking to myself...

54
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,250

我能帮你完成 山姆
I can do that for you, Sam.

60
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,000
该死的 我说过我来做
God damn it! I said I got it!

61
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,710
你就不能听我的话么
Why don't you listen to me?

62
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,720
货物准备发射

63

山姆 没事吧
Sam, is everything OK?

64
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,660
- 山姆？ - 干吗？

65
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,500
你今天看上去和平时不大一样
You don't seem like yourself today.

66
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,630
- 出问题了吗  - 没有 你能把它关了吗
- Is something wrong?  - No. Can you turn that off, please?

67
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,590
天啊
Jesus Christ!

68
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,010
山姆 和我聊聊也许会有用
Sam, it might help you to talk about it.

69
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,930
柯里 你有没有关于维修月星的新消息
Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing Lunar-Sat?

70
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,690
没有 山姆
No, Sam.

71
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,690
据我所知 在公司优先名单上
From what I understand, it is fairly low...

72
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,110
该项目现排名低至可忽略不计
on the company's priority list right now.

73
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,690
你得叫他们解决掉
You tell them to sort that out.

74
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,190
你知道我在说什么 对吧
You know what I'm talking about? That's not?

75
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,360
我只剩两周 无所谓了
I've only got two weeks!

76
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,490
但对于轮班的人来说可就不公平了
But it's not fair for whoever's coming up here next.

77
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,250
好的 山姆 需要我等会再帮你剪头发吗
I will, Sam. Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?

78
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,330
不 继续剪吧
No, come on; let's finish this.

79
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,460
又头疼了
Got one of those headaches...

80
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,750
你能给我点治头疼的药么

87
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,680
我也很想你
I miss you, too!

88
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,890
我知道你在上面很孤独
I know you're really lonely up there...

89
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,640
但我想 从很多角度看
But I think... In a lot of ways....

90
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,350
其实这样对你更好
it's been really good for you.

91
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,350
对我们都好
For both of us.

92
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,110
天 希望你别介意我这么说

我为你骄傲
I'm proud of you!

94
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,330
有人想和你说两句
Someone has got something to say.

95
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,040
想和爸爸说什么 宝宝
What did you want to say to daddy, baby?

96
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,790
说“宇航员”
Say "astronaut".

97
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,380
宇航员
Astronaut.

98
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,460
他是一个宇航员
He is an astronaut!

99
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,220
说爸爸是宇航员 大声点
Say daddy's an astronaut. Say it really loud.

104
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,150
真不敢相信你马上就能回家啦
I can't believe you're going to be home soon.

105
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,780
下个月她就过生日了
It's her birthday next month...

106
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,110
我在想 也许该在花园里给她建个玩具屋
And I was thinking about maybe a playhouse for the garden.

107
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,410
- 柯里  - 我们可以一起去布置
- Gerty!  - We could work at it together.

凯斯
Kath...

118
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,100
不太秒
Not good!

119
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,610
那大象怎么样
What about Dumbo?...

120
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,280

Fuck!

121
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,070

God damn it!

122
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,740
我日
Fuck!

123
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,200
我又犯傻了 是吧 柯里
Wasn't kind of smart, was it, Gerty?

124
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:41,080
- 山姆 我能问问发生什么了吗  - 我告诉过你了
- Sam, can I ask how it happened?  - I told you.

125
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,630
我光顾着看电视然后开水烫到手了
I saw something on TV and I spilled boiling water on my hand.

126
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,420
你看电视？
You saw something on TV?

127
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,130
对 电视让我分神了
Yeah, I something on TV that distracted me.

128
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,220
这有什么问题吗 柯里
Is there something wrong with that, Gerty?

129
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,140
山姆 你说你被电视分神了
Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you...

130
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,850
但我进来时 电视是关着的
but when I came in, the TV wasn't on.

131
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,270
也许是你出现幻觉了
Perhaps you were imagining things?

132
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,270
哈 你想太多了 伙计
Yeah, you think too much, pal.

133

你需要躺会 我得继续干活
You need to get laid. I'm going to go back to work.

134
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,250

- 手怎么样  - 噢 还有点疼

一点点 没事
A little sore. It's OK.

141
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:56,010
- 早餐想吃什么  - 和平时一样
- What's for breakfast?  - The usual.

142
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,050
嗯哼
Mmhmm.

143
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,640
- 还剩两周 山姆  - 还剩两周 老兄
- Two weeks to go, Sam.  - Two weeks to go, buddy!

144
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,770
要在豆子上浇点热沙司吗
Would you like some hot sauce on your beans?

145
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,310
不用 实际上我的胃有点小毛病
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.

146
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,480
不过 还是谢啦 柯里
But, thank you. Thank you, Gerty.

147
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,740
不客气 山姆
You're welcome, Sam.

148
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:21,530
太平洋时间八点十九分 数据如下
08:19, Pacific Time. Readouts are as follows...

149
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:24,580
马修号 九点八英里
Matthew ... 9.8 miles.

150
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,950
马克号距离更近？
Mark is less?

151
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,040
- 九…  - 嘿 柯里
- 9...  - Hey, Gerty!

152
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,540
干活咯
Rock and roll!

153
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,600
马克号 嗯…
Mark,mmm...

154
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,810
仪表显示马克号距离十一英里
Mark is 11 miles on the button.

155
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,150
卢克号今天有点小着急
Luke is a little twitchy today.

156
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,830
嗨 柯里
Hey, Gerty.

157
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,290
看上去好像马修号又装满了一罐能源
Looks like we have got a live one out on Matthew.

158
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,880
我要出去几分钟
I'm going to go out in a few minutes.

159
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,700
就当出去喝杯咖啡 好吗
I'm just going to finish my coffee, OK?

160
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,800
好的 山姆
OK, Sam.

161
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,430
远距通讯信号搜索中
Searching for long-range comms.

162
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,560
信号搜索失败
Signal failure on long-range comms.

163
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,210
危险 空气外泄
Danger. Atmosphere compromised.

164
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,420
我在哪…
Where am...

165
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,590
- 我在哪里  - 山姆 你在医务室
- Where am I?  - Sam, you're in the infirmary.

166
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,420
你出了事故 还记得怎么回事吗
You had an accident. Do you remember what happened?

167
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,180
不 我…一点都记不得了
No, I don't... I don't remember a thing.

168
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,940
你还记得我吗
Do you remember me?

169
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,610
当然记得你 柯里
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.

170
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,980
很好 好极了
That's good. That is very good.

171
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,490
好高兴看到你清醒过来
It's nice to see you awake again.

172
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,570
我得让你在医务室待两天接受观察
I'd like to keep you under observation here in the infirmary for a few days

173
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,660
再进行些测试
And run some tests.

174
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,200
我昏迷多久了
How long have I been out?

175
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,540
不久 山姆 你再睡一会吧
Not long, Sam. Go back to sleep.

176
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,710
- 好的 伙计  - 你还是很劳累
- OK, pal.  - You're still very tired.

177
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,340
我们以后再谈
We can talk later.

178
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,460
有人吗
Hello?

179
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,950
新山姆正在重新修订指令
The new Sam is in reworking order.

180
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,070
但我们只剩两台可供使用的采能车
But we only have two working harvesters now.

181
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,080
是啊 真是意外啊
Yeah, well,what a surprise!

182
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,040
柯里 我们得想办法提高产量
Gerty, we're going to have to find a way to ramp up production.

183
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,500
我知道
I know.

184
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,170
真是难以置信 但你如何在一天时间里…
This is incredible! But how do you manage to destroy...

185
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,960
同时销毁一辆探路车一台采能车和一名员工呢
a fucking rover, a harvester and an employee all on the same day?

186
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,970
正如您所知 这是突发状况
These were extraordinary circumstances, as you know.

187
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,380
柯里 三号采能车状况怎么样
Gerty, what is the status on Harvester 3?

188
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,350
维修进展怎么…
How do the repairs look on...

189
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,260
- 山姆 你下床了  - 是啊
- Sam, you're out of bed.  - Yeah.

190
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,440
我想舒展下两条腿 刚才是谁
I wanted to stretch my legs a bit. Who was that?

191
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,070
月星出了点问题
We've been having some problems with the Lunar-Sat...

192
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,280
所以能源传递可能得暂停了
And our live feed seems to be down.

193
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,990
我已经录制了中心的视频信息
I was recording a video-message for Central...

194
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,370
并将其更新在你的进度上
Updating them on your progress.

195
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,450
山姆 你需要待在床上休息
Sam, you need to stay in bed.

196
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,290
你还没做好下床走动的准备
You're not ready to walk around yet.

197
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,000
能把我的太阳眼镜拿来吗 这里太亮了
Can you bring me my sunglasses? It's really bright in here.

198
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,920
给我点…把我的东西都拿来 你知道的
Give me some... Give me all my stuff, you know?

199
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,930
你的私人物品都在你的住宿区 山姆
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.

200
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,470
- 那就把它们挪过来  - 好的
- Well, bring them in here.  - Certainly.

201
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,400
好极了 山姆
Excellent, Sam.

202
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,450
我…我可以离开这了吗 柯里
What... When can I get out of here, Gerty?

203
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,700
山姆 撞车时你的脑部可能受伤了
Sam, you may have suffered from brain damage in the crash.

204
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,120
所以你短期记忆失忆 逻辑混乱
This would explain your slight memory loss and logic impairment.

205
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,540
那诊断结论是什么 我什么时候可以回去工作
So what's the diagnosis? When can I get back to work?

206
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,170
中心已经要求我减缓采能进度
Central has asked me to slow down the harvesters...

207
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,300
以确保你有足够时间痊愈
to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back.

208
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,430
这很好
That's terrific!

209
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,510
非常棒
That's fantastic!

210
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,800
你明天就可以回你的住宿区
You can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow.

211
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,720
但要想恢复到正常的工作状态
But it will still be a few more days

212
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,600
还需要几天时间
before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.

213
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,440
我们进行下一个测试
Let's try another test.

214
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,690
我不想再做什么测试
I don't want to try another test!

215
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,190
拜托了 山姆
Please, Sam.

216
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,390
嘿 柯里
Hey, Gerty?

217
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,060
你知道这个吗
Do you know about this?

218
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,560
马修号的读数一点反映也没有 它已经完全沉寂了
Matthew has got no velocity readout. He is completely still.

219
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,440
它一定是抛锚了
He must have stalled.

220
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,860
是的 明显是抛锚了
Well, he has obviously stalled.

221
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,150
你不认为我们该告诉中心么
Don't you think we should tell Central?

222
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,440
给门解锁 我要出去修修看
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.

223
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,950
我会传达你的意见
I will pass on your message.

224
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,910
经“朱庇特”中转 地球方面已收到信息
Message received from Earth via Jupiter link.

225
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,530
山姆 我们很感谢你的提议
Sam, we appreciate the offer,

226
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,870
但你最好以康复为第一要务
but you concentrate on feeling better.

227
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,500
是的 我们不想让你承担不必要的风险
Yeah, we don't want you to take any unnecessary risks.

228
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,210
- 对我们来说你太重要了  - 保持原状
- You are too important to us.  - You stay put.

229
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,000
这是命令
That is an order.

230
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,090
这是命令 山姆 月星总部的命令
It's an order, Sam... from Lunar.

231
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,130
我们的下一步行动是输送一组救援小队过来
And what we're going to do is send a rescue unit...

232
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:00,090
帮助修理采能车 以使它能自己返回基地
to tend to the stalled harvester and get the base back on its feet.

233
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:03,430
- 操他娘的 妈的  - 抱歉 山姆
- Fuck is with...? What the fuck?  - I'm sorry, Sam.

234
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,720
- 什么  - 山姆…
- What?  - Sam...

235
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,600
我必须服从直接命令 禁止你外出
I'm under strict orders not to let you outside.

236
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,980
我可不喜欢被当成个小孩子对待
I don't appreciate that was being treated like a child.

237
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,230
不喜欢
I don't appreciate it.

238
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,520
柯里
Gerty!

239
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,190
柯里
Gerty!

240
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,990
柯里 过来
Gerty, come here!

241
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,410
- 怎么了  - 我不知道 也许被陨石击中了
- What happened?  - I do not know, maybe a meteorite...

242
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,700
这里没有陨石 山姆
There have been no meteorites, Sam.

243
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,700
陨石微粒 也许吧 我不知道
Micrometeorites, maybe. I do not know.

244
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,210
不管怎样 也许外层护罩也被损坏了
Either way, there might be damage to the exterior shell.

245
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,000
我想你最好…最好让我出去查查
I think you better... you better let me go outside and take a look.

246
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,290
外层护罩没有损坏
There is no damage to the exterior shell.

247
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,500
好吧 也许没有 但我不相信 柯里
Well, it's not that I don't believe you, Gerty...

248
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,630
可是 你看 这玩意漏得像个消防喷头一样
But, you know, this thing is springing leaks like an Acme firehose.

249
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,140
你得让我出去解决问题 柯里
You need to let me go outside and fix this problem, Gerty.

250
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,300
我不能让你出去 山姆
I can't let you go outside, Sam.

251
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,560
柯里 你要是不让我出去 我们就不能修复泄露
Gerty, if you don't let me go outside, we can't fix this leak.

252
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,680
我被禁止允许你外出
I'm not permitted to let you go outside.

253
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,650
就让我…你知我知天知地知 怎么样 伙计
Just let... We'll keep it between you and me, ok, pal?

254
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,770
这可是气体外泄 出发吧 来吧
This thing is leaking gas. Let's go! Come on...

255
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,740
就去查查外层护罩吗
Just to check the exterior shell?

256
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,570
- 那当然  - 好吧 山姆
- Of course.  - OK, Sam.

257
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,740
谢谢
Thank you.

258
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,170
柯里
Gerty!

259
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,120
远距通讯信号搜索中
Searching for long-range comms.

260
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,290
远距通讯信号搜索中
Searching for long-range comms.

261
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,880
远距通讯信号搜索中
Searching for long-range comms.

262
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,220
信号搜索失败
Signal failure on long-range comms.

263
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,800
柯里
Gerty!

264
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,130
柯里
Gerty!

265
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,510
我在外面找到他了
I found him outside!

266
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,480
我在外面找到他了
I found him outside!

267
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,360
就在那个抛锚的采能车边上
Near one of the stalled harvesters...

268
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,610
他是谁
Who is he?

269
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,230
他是谁？！
Who is he?!

270
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,030
我们得把他带回医务室
We need to get him to the infirmary.

271
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,280
除非你告诉我他是谁
Not until you tell me who that is.

272
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,370
告诉我他是谁！
You tell me who that is!

273
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:19,040
山姆・贝尔 我们需要立即带他去医务室

The infirmary.

278
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,770
你在一台采能车那遇到事故了
You had an accident out by one of the harvesters.

279
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,020
你还记得吗
Do you remember?

280
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:51,570
不记得 我好渴
No, I'm thirsty.

281
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,490
我去给你倒点水
I could get you some water.

282
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,160
我在外面看到个人 柯里
I saw someone out there, Gerty.

283
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,710
我在外面看到个人
I saw someone out there.

284
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,800
山姆 你在撞击中遭受轻微脑震荡
Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash

285
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,130
以及不可治愈的局部损伤
and have incurred minor injuries.

286
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,970
但重点是 医疗预计是好的
But, all in all, the prognosis is good.

287
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,350
很高兴再次看到你

288
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,460

290
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,670
房间里是不是还有个人和我们在一起
Is there someone in the room with us?

291
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,390
山姆 该睡会了
Sam, get some sleep.

292
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,520
你太疲劳了
You're very tired.

293
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,380
今天说到汤普森了
Spoke to Thompson today.

294
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:33,340
他们在欧洲 向全世界许诺
They are in Europe, they are promising the world.

295
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,100
我觉得那是正确的
I think it was the right thing.

296
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,560
但是…太漫长了
But... it's just such a long time.

297
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,530
我觉得 是时候…
I suppose there are things...

298
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:59,410
你知道…是时候做些什么了
You know... that needed to happen.

299
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,910
我需要时间考虑
I need time to think.

300
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,630
听着…呃…
Listen... umm...

301
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,710
山姆
Sam...

302
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,760
注意安全…我会…
Be safe... And I'll...

303
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,430
我会再和你联系的
I'll talk to you soon.

304
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,510
再见
Goodbye.

305
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,920
柯里
Gerty?

306
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,670
柯里 他妈的到底怎么回事
Gerty, what the fuck, what the hell's going on?

307
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,510
他是谁 康乐室里这人是谁
Who is the guy? Who is the guy in the rec room?

308
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,800
他从哪来 为什么长得和我一样
Where did he come from? Why does he look like me?

309
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,010
山姆 你下床了
Sam, you're out out of bed.

310
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,930
没错 柯里 我下床了 他是谁
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed. Who is the guy?

311
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,600
康乐室里那人是谁
Who is the guy in the rec room?

312
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,810
- 山姆・贝尔  - 快告诉我吧
- Sam Bell.  - Come on, come on, come on!

313
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,650
你是山姆・贝尔
You are Sam Bell.

314
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,690
山姆 怎么了
Sam, what is it?

315
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,110
也许谈谈对你有帮助
It might help to talk about it.

316
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,700
我不明白发生什么了
I don't understand what is happening...

317
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:28,240
我觉得我开始丧失理智了
I think I'm starting to lose my mind.

318
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,620
我们可以做些测试
We can run some tests.

319
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:32,540
我没有让山姆联系月星
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.

320
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,710
他们不知道你从事故中逃生
They do not know that you were recovered alive from the accident.

321
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:39,000
“逃生”？什么意思 你为什么不向中心报告
"Recovered alive"? What do you mean? Why did not you report it to Central?

322
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,920
你究竟在说什么
What are you talking about?

323
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,800
我在这儿保证你的安全 山姆
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.

324
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,430
你饿吗
Are you hungry?

325

two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...

328
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,380
- 我只是过来拿我的拖鞋…  - 我在用
- I'm just getting my slippers...  - I'm using them... I'm using them.

329
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,630
那是我的
These are mine.

330
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,640
柯里说你是山姆・贝尔
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.

331
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:18,900
我也是山姆・贝尔！
I'm Sam Bell, too!

332
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,650
- 什么  - 好吧 就是这样子
- What?  - Well, we've got that going for us.

333
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,280
为什么…
Why...?

334
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,580
你已经…多久了
How long have you been...

335
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,580
什么
What?

336
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,120
你已经在这多久了
How long have you been here?

337
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,000
大约一周
About a week.

338
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,460
- 那你都做得怎样  - 什么
- So how are you doing?  - What?

339
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,130
你做得怎样
How are you doing?

340
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,880
“我做得怎样”
"How am I doing?"

341
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,260
你觉得我做的怎样
How do you think I'm doing?

342
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,820
他们封锁了所有出口 谁在照看采能车
They locked all the exits. Who's looking after the harvesters?

343
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,610
采能车没事
Harvesters are fine.

344
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:15,080
事实上 我在这对着克隆说话才有事
It's the fact that I'm here talking to a clone that's slightly troubling.

345
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,210
我不是克隆
I'm not a clone.

346
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,250
我不是克隆
I'm not a clone!

347
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:30,720
- 你才是  - 好吧 山姆
- You're the clone.  - Okay, Sam.

348
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,140
你不是克隆
You're not a clone.

349
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,610
嘿嘿 你看上去不太好

350
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:50,450
嘘 就当我放屁 我啥都没说过 伙计
Sh! Butt out of this! I'm not even talking to you, pal.

351
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,030
我觉得凯瑟琳对你有意思 我觉得她喜欢你
I think that Katherine likes you. I think she likes you a bit.

352
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,410
你看上去不太好 朋友
You're not looking too good, my friend.

353
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,210
希望你感觉别太糟
I hope you're not feeling too bad.

354
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,620
你在自言自语？
Are you talking to yourself?

355
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,830
- 让我们来帮你解决问题  - 你在这里多久了
- Let's just get you fixed up...  - How long have you been here?

大约…三年了
Well, it's about... three years.

357
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:09,300
快到三年了
For almost three years.

358
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,430

Listen, I...

359

I wanted to thank you?

360

我想谢谢你 呃
I wanted to thank you for, um...

361
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,560
要不是有你 我…
If it wasn't for you, I'd...

362
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,520
我估计现在还躺在瘫痪的探路车里 你救了我
I guess I'd still be in that crashed rover. You saved my life.

363
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,570
我知道这很古怪…
Hey, I know this is weird, you know...?

364
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:37,160
我真的很孤独 你知道的 我…
I'm real lonely, you know, I...

365
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:40,580
我只想同你握下手 你愿意吗
I just wanted to shake your hand. Will you shake my hand?

366
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,550
也许以后吧
Maybe later.

367
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,890
你在看什么
What are you looking at?

368
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,430
你看上去和我一模一样 太不可思议了
You look just like me; it's incredible.

369
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,390
为什么是我看上去像你？
Why do I look like you?

370
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,730
为什么不是你看上去像我？
Why don't you look like me?

371
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,560
也许我们看上去都很像 我不知道
We look like each other, I guess. I don't know.

372

我不需要你来教
I don't need you to show me how to hold it!

382

391
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,430
你得换个方式来处理
You should approach this in a different way.

392
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,720
- 还记得你去飞行学校吗  - 你在干吗
- Remember when you went to flight school?  - What are you doing?

393
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,180

She's our little monkey.

413

来击个掌
High five!

414
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,160
也许她是送奶工的 但她很漂亮
She might be the milkman's, but she's beautiful.

415

好好享受吧 我们有些好消息
Well, enjoy it while it lasts. We've got some good news.

422

朱庇特项目不得不中断了
The Jupiter program had to be put on hiatus,

423
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,060
我们给你派了些人手

伊莱扎救援小组

426
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:38,070
过去两周里伊莱扎被布署在

坚持住 山姆 通话结束
You hang in there, Sam. Over and out!

434
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:55,000
他们派救援小队来？为什么 为什么要这样做
They're sending a rescue unit? Why? Why are they sending a rescue unit?

435
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,750
为了修好抛锚的采能车 他们不认为我搞得定
To fix the stalled harvester. They didn't think I was up to it.

436
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,340
很好 然后我就可以回去了
Well, then I'm going back.

437
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:02,010
是我回去
That's it for me.

438
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,640
- 什么  - 你真这样以为？
- What?  - Is that what you really think?

439
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,350
没错 我有合同
Yeah. I've got a contract!

440

我要回家
I'm going home.

441
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:13,890
- 你就他妈一克隆 屎都不是  - 嘿 我要回家了
- You're a fucking clone. You don't have shit.  - Hey, I'm going home!

442
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,860
- 回家  - 你哪都去不了
- Home!  - You're not going anywhere.

443
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,690
你知道 你待在上头太久了 都开始丧失理智了
You know, you've been up here too long, man. You have lost your marbles.

444
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,280
你以为呢 苔丝躺在家里沙发上
What do you think, Tess is back home,

445
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,280
穿着蕾丝睡衣等你？
waiting for you on the sofa in lingerie?

446
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,570
那个原版的山姆怎么办 嗯？
What about the original Sam? Huh?

447

我才是原版的山姆
I am the original Sam!

448

Me!

450
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,460
我
Me!

451
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:36,210
柯里 我是克隆吗
Gerty, am I a clone?

452
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,170
你饿吗
Are you hungry?

453
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:47,260
嗨 嗨
Hey, hey...

454
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:53,180
你别他妈的搞不清状况 我俩现在一条船上 混蛋
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist. I'm in the same boat, asshole.

455
00:42:58,810 --> 00:42:59,860
听着
Listen...

456
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,650
- 其他的克隆人怎么办  - 什么
- What about the other clones?  - What?

457
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,820
也许我们不是仅有的被激活的两个
We might not be the first two to have been woken up.

458
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:06,740
你是说当你在这时那个模型就已经做了一半了？
You said that that model had already been started when you got here.

459
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:07,780
那么 是谁干的
Well, who started it?

460
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:10,200
也许是之前来这里的人
There might be others up here right now.

461
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:15,210
仔细想想 你撞车后我怎么会这么快就到达这里
Think about it. How did I get up here so quickly after your crash?

462
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:18,210
- 我不知道  - 他们就没有从中心把我装船
- I don't know...  - They didn't ship me in from Central.

463
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,710
没有时间 我一定是从基地里来的
There wasn't time. I must have come from the base.

464
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,420
我听不懂你的意思
I don't know what you're smoking.

465
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,220
为什么他们要那样做 太荒唐了
Why would they do that? That's ridiculous.

466
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,930
不可能
Impossible.

467
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,220
我猜这里肯定有个密室
I bet there's some kind of secret room.

468
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,260
密室？
"Secret room"?

469
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:33,970
没错 有个密室 为何不会有
Yeah, a secret room. Why not?

470
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,140
知道嘛 你才是失去理智的那个人
You know, you are the one that has lost your marbles.

471
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,770
我在这三年了 朋友
I've been here three years, man.

472
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:40,310
基地里的一砖一瓦我都认识
I know every inch of this base.

473
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,440
我连夹在壁板里的灰尘有多厚都清清楚楚
And I know how many dirt is between those wall panels over there.

474
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:45,530
那他们为何这么做 动机是什么
Why would they do that? What's the motive?

475
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,530
你看 他们是公司 对吧
Look, it's a company, right?

476
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:51,490
有的是投资人 股东 还有诸如此类的臭狗屎
They have investors, they have shareholders. Shit like that.

477
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,500
哪一个更经济 花钱花时间去培训一个新人
What's cheaper? Spending time and money training new personnel...

478
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,210
还是弄一打备胎给这个岗位？
Or you just have a couple of spares here to do the job?

479
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,210
这里是月球远端
It's the far side of the moon!

480
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:02,960
这群贱人连个通讯卫星都没修好！
Those cheap fucks haven't even fixed the communication satellite yet!

481
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,840
苔丝会知道的 她会告诉我的
Tess would know, she would have told me...

482

嗨 泽佩托 醒醒吧
Hey, Gepetto, wake up!

483
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:10,890
你真的以为他们会他妈的关心我们？
You really think they give a shit about us?

484
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,850
他们正在去银行的路上哈哈大笑
They're laughing all the way to the bank!

485
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,720
苔丝会知道的 她会告诉我的
Tess would know, she would have told me...

486
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:15,680
你就不能起来？！
Where do you get off?!

487
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,690
他妈的坐在那生闷气跟个欠揍的娃一样
Fucking sitting there sulking like a little fucking boy!

488
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,900
- 天啊  - 醒醒吧
- Jesus Christ...  - Wake up!

489
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:26,740
这里一定有什么我们不知道的区域
There's some area that we don't know about.

490
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:28,610
我要去把他找出来
And I'm going to find it.

491
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:32,660
是啊 说不定你还能找到宝藏
Yeah, maybe you'll find some buried treasure, too.

492
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,440
操
Fuck!

493
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,200

You find your secret room?

495
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:18,660
就把它搁那儿吧
Just put that anywhere.

496
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,710
嗯 这是个好主意

- 这就是我放我的小妖精的地方  - 闪开
- That's where I keep my leprechauns.  - Get out of the way.

- 什么 为什么  - 我想查查模型下面
- What? Why?  - I want to look underneath that model.

499
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,380
不许你碰模型
You're not touching this model.

500
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:33,760
他妈的给我让开
Get the fuck out of the way!

501

听着 为什么你就不能放松一下
Listen, why don't you just relax, right?

502

505
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:44,560
不 我是个热爱和平的勇士
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.

506
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,320
我是个博爱的人 不是个嗜暴之徒

I see it now. I see what Tess was talking about.

544
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:00,550
我从没和你说过 柯里 但她…
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...

545
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:08,680
她离开我了 苔丝和我分了
She left me. Tess left me.

546
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,600
分了六个月了 她搬回娘家住了
For 6 months. She moved back in with her parents.

547
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:12,940
我知道
I know.

548
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:19,820
她又给了我一次机会
She gave me a second chance.

549
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:24,530
- 我答应她我会改  - 你已经改了 山姆
- I promised her that I'd change.  - You have changed, Sam.

550
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:28,700
嗨 柯里 自从我上来以后 我发给苔丝…
Hey, Gerty, since I've been up here, I've sent Tess...

551
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:31,830
发了一百多条视频短信
I've sent her over a hundred video messages.

552
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:33,790
这些短信都去哪了
Where did those messages go?

553
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,670
她收到了吗
Did they ever reach her?

554
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:39,220
山姆 我只知道基地里发生的事
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.

555
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,640
那她发给我的呢
What about the messages she sent to me?

556
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:49,640
山姆 我只知道基地里发生的事
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.

557
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:09,370
柯里…柯里？
Gerty... Gerty?

558
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:17,090
我真的是个克隆吗
Am I really a clone?

559
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,300
当你第一次到达莎拉站的时候 发生了小碰撞
When you first arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash.

560
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:23,970
你在医务室醒过来
You woke up in the infirmary.

561
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:27,100
你的大脑局部受创 记忆丧失
You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss.

562
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:30,100
我对你进行医学观察 还做了些测试
I kept you under observation and ran some tests.

563
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,640
我记得 对 我记得
I remember, yea, I remember that...

564
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,850
山姆 其实没有什么碰撞 你是被激活的
Sam, there was no crash. You were being awakened.

565
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:38,020
为了保证神智正常 和机能健康
It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests...

566
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:40,650
对所有新克隆人
to establish mental stability..

567
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,400
进行测试属于标准程序
and general physical health.

568
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:46,370
DNA复制中的细小错误和遗传性变异
Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA...

569
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:48,160
会影响到…
can have considerable impact on...

570
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,450
那苔丝呢 夏娃呢
What about Tess? What about Eve?

571
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:52,750
都是记忆植入 山姆
They are memory implants, Sam.

572
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,540
从真正的山姆・贝尔那上传并经修改的记忆
Uploaded, edited memories of the original Sam Bell.

573
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:19,320
我很抱歉
I'm very sorry.

574
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:25,360
山姆 你已经好几个小时没有吃东西了
Sam, it's been several hours since your last meal.

575
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:27,360
要我给你做点吃的吗
Can I prepare you something?

576
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:14,580
救援小组预计十一小时后到达
Rescue arrival estimated in 11 hours.

577
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:23,050
- 没事吧 宝贝  - 我只是去看看星空
- You OK, sweetheart?  - Yeah, I'm staring into space.

578
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:27,550
嗨 谢啦 这玩意儿很不错
Hey! Thanks for this, this is good.

579
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:31,050
这玩意挺保暖 你鼻子咋样
This is cozy. How's the nose?

580
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:33,760
好多了 谢谢
Much better, thank you.

581
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:39,810
刚刚我疯掉了 你知道…我失去理智了…我…
I went haywire before. You know... I lost it. I...

582
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,030
- 我很抱歉  - 没事
- I'm sorry about that.  - It's OK.

583
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:47,780
不 有事 我把菲尔德掀翻了
No, it's not OK. I fucked up Fairfield.

584
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:48,900
把你的模型搞得一团糟
I fucked up your model.

585
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,780
我也不知道自己怎么了 我…
I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got...

586
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,080
我一下子就来了火气 我得做点什么避免再犯
I've got a temper, I've got to do something about that.

587
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,830
是的 确实
Yes, you do.

588
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:01,210
嗨 你能关掉一会吗 我想和你谈谈
Hey, can you turn that off for a second? I want to talk to you.

589
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:03,290
你能把它关掉吗
Can you turn that off?

590
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:06,010
听着 听着
Listen. Listen.

591
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:07,670
我不是想…
I wasn't supposed to...

592
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:12,890
我只是想告诉你点事儿
I'm trying to tell you something.

593
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:17,680
我从没指示柯里去…
I never instructed Gerty to...

594
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:23,110
听我说 我当时没想到要去找你
Listen to me. I wasn't supposed to find you...

595
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,610
硬汉
Tough Guy.

596
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:35,410
- 听我说  - 你穿得像个女用的太空棉棒
- Listen to me!  - You look like a radioactive tampon.

597
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:36,990
整一个XX更健康的大香蕉
Like a banana with a yeast infection.

598
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:42,290
听我说 我没打算去找你
Listen to me. I wasn't supposed to find you.

599
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:46,960
你在外面时 月星指示柯里把我锁在基地里
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base while you were out there.

600
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,800
还有别的 差不多在我苏醒的时候
And there's something else. Right around the time I was awakened...

601
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:52,430
我听到柯里在和中心联系
I walked in on Gerty talking with Central.

602
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:54,220
而且是实时通讯
He was having a live conversation.

603
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:56,470
“实时通讯”
"A live conversation"?

604
00:53:56,970 --> 00:54:00,230
- 没错  - 你怎么知道是实时通讯
- Yeah  - How do you know it was a live conversation?

605
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:03,850
因为他们是在一问一答地对话
Because it was a back-and-forth exchange.

606
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:07,900
可通讯设备早就被太阳风暴损坏了
Communications equipment was damaged. There was a solar storm.

607
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,940
真的是实时通讯 伙计 实时
It was live, man, it was live.

608
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,700
不可能 太阳耀斑早就把卫星烧坏了
That's impossible. There was a flare, it fried the satellite.

609
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:13,910
卫星没事
The satellite is fine.

610
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:17,080
他们不想让我们联系上地球 他们骗了我们
They don't want us to be able to contact Earth. They lied to us.

611
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,250
从一开始就在骗我们
They've been lying to us since the beginning.

612
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:21,000
一直就在骗我们
They've been lying since forever.

613
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:25,330
如果卫星管用 他们怎么从基地里屏蔽信号
If the satellite works, how are they blocking the live feed from down here?

614
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,420
其他仪器都很正常啊
Everything works fine.

615
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:31,300
也许他们不是从基地里封锁的信号？
Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base?

616
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:33,470
那从哪儿
From where, then?

617
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:57,280
远距通讯信号搜索中
Searching for long-range comms.

618
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:01,120
远距通讯信号搜索中
Searching for long-range comms.

619
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,960
我刚刚超越最后一辆采能车 好像是约翰号
I'm just passing the last of the harvesters. Looks like John.

620
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,040
远距通讯信号搜索中
Searching for long-range comms.

621
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,920
你驶出基地范围还需要多久
How long until you are out of the base's range?

622
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:10,800
一分钟
Um, a minute.

623
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:14,880
- 最多九十秒  - 你有到过那么远吗
- 90 seconds tops.  - Have you ever been out this far?

624
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:19,100
- 没有 从来没有  - 信号搜索失败
- No... never have.  - Signal failure on long-range comms.

625
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:23,310
驶离莎拉站区域
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.

626
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:26,230
驶离莎拉站区域
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.

627
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,570
驶离莎拉站区域
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.

628
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:45,750
- 看到什么了  - 我都不知道自己在找啥
- See anything?  - It'd help if I knew what the hell I was looking for.

629
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,750
等等 我看到什么了
Wait a second, I see something.

630
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:53,550
三号基站接近中
Approaching station 3.

631
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,260
妈的 我想我也看到了
Holy shit! I think I see something, too.

632
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:42,760
一号基站接近中
Approaching station 1.

633
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:51,860
你看到的和我看到的一样么 它看上去像天线或者
Do you see what I see? Looks like an antenna or... or...

634
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,570
像是个发射塔一样的东西 应该是个干扰发射器
A pylon or something. I think it's the jammer.

635
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:59,450
老兄 这就是我们收不到信号的原因
Dude! This is why we're not getting the live feed.

636
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:22,510
- 山姆 听得见吗  - 嗯
- Sam? Can you hear me?  - Yeah.

637
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,270
我听得见
Yeah, yeah I hear you.

638
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:29,730
我感觉不太好
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.

639
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:31,810
我要…我要先回基地
I'm going to... I'm going to head back to the base.

640
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:34,230
好 我在外面继续兜一会
OK, I'm going to stay out here for a while.

641
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:36,070
看看还有没有别的干扰器
I'm going to see if there's any more of these things.

642
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:05,680

这个状况正常吗
How about that for a status?

We'll do this another time.

救援小组预计九小时后到达
Rescue arrival estimated in 9 hours.

655
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:24,770
躺下 放松 深呼吸
Lay down, relax and breathe deeply.

656

低温冷冻箱用来

帮助进入深层睡眠

658
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:32,910
从而渡过返程所需的三天时间
The duration of your three-day return journey back to Earth.

659
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:34,700
当你感到睡意来临
As you begin to feel sleepy,

660
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:37,910
就想想你所完成的了不起的工作
think about the magnificent job that you've done.

661
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:41,460
想想你的家人多么为你的成就而自豪
And how proud your family are of what you've accomplished.

662
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:46,790
月星企业之所以成为世界最大的清洁能源供应商
Lunar Industries remains the #1 provider of clean energy worldwide...

663
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,010
就是因为有你们这些辛勤工作的员工
Due to the hard work of people like you.

664

[棒子语：再见]

嗨 我又找到了三座类似的干扰器
Hey, I saw 3 more of those jammers.

667
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:51,500
估计基地就被围在当中 我把坐标都打出来了
I think the base is surrounded with them. I printed out their coordinates.

668
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:54,630

Bud, what's wrong with you?

为什么会如此之多
Why are there so many of them?

674

Gerty, why did you help me before?

677
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:27,910
帮我输密码 那不是和你的程序相违吗
With the password? Doesn't that go against your programming or something?

678
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,870
我的程序就是帮助你
Helping you is what I do.

679
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:43,840
驶离萨拉站工作范围

681
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,810
远距通讯信号搜索中

Could you call back? There's something wrong with the picture.

687
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,730
我想找苔丝・贝尔

688
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:40,480
抱歉 她几年前就过世了
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.

689
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:01,960
- 你确定？ - 我想是的
- Are you sure?  - Yeah, I think so.

690
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:05,170
我是她女儿 能帮你什么吗
I'm her daughter. Can I help you?

691
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:09,970
夏娃？

692
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:13,220
- 是的  - 嗨 夏娃

695
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,400
妈咪是怎么死的 亲爱的
How did mommy die, sweetheart?

696
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:29,280
妈咪是怎么死的
How did mommy die?

697
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:32,490
- 爸爸  - 在
- Dad!  - Yeah.

698
01:09:32,830 --> 01:09:36,160
- 有人问妈妈的事  - 谁在问
- There's someone asking about mom.  - Who's asking about mom?

699
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:50,470
够了 够了
That's enough. That's enough.

700
01:09:55,970 --> 01:09:57,430
我想回家
I want to go home!

701
01:10:03,690 --> 01:10:05,440
…我想回家…
...want to go...

702
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:40,600
伊莱扎小队将在七小时后到达

703
01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:43,940
操
Fuck!

704
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,270
- 怎么 你切到自己了？ - 是的
- What, did you cut yourself?  - Yeah.

705
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:51,030
你笑什么
What are you laughing at?

706
01:10:51,530 --> 01:10:52,570
你可不能像要去
Well, you don't hold it

707
01:10:53,030 --> 01:10:56,240
捅人一样拿小刻刀
like you're trying to stab somebody, for God's sakes.

708
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:57,280
来 给我
Here, give me that.

709
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:06,340
得握得离刀刃近一点 看到吗 就像我这样
You've got to hold it closer to the blade, you see? Watch what I'm doing.

710
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:07,380
你在发抖？
Why are you shaking?

711
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:10,090
像这样刻下去
Carve out like that.

712
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:27,730
这里有点冷
It's freezing in here.

713
01:11:28,570 --> 01:11:31,570
你就像坐在冰柜里一样 你到底怎么了
Well, you're sitting under the fridge. What's going on with you?

714
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:32,820
你没事吧？
You all right?

715
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:36,910
没事 运过来的那组人
Yeah, that crew they're sending us...

716
01:11:37,950 --> 01:11:40,080
要是他们发现我们俩同时被激活了
If they find us awake at the same time,

717
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,370
他们绝不会放过我们
they aren't going to let us live.

718
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:46,790
你知道的 对吧
You know that, right?

719
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:51,710
你也知道 返程载具其实…
You know, the return vehicle is a...

720
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:58,800
你没事吧
You OK?

721
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:05,560
你应该躺一会 吃点镇静剂之类的药
You should lay down for a while. Take some tranquilizers or something.

722
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:08,480
镇静剂？我就要永久性沉睡了
"Take some tranquilizers"? I'll never wake up again.

723
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:20,280
你会好起来的 一切都会好起来的
You're going to be OK. Everything's going to be OK.

724
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:32,880
我好冷
I'm freezing.

725
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:48,520
嘿 嘿 嘿
Hey, hey? Hey?

726
01:12:55,610 --> 01:12:57,490
我真的很害怕
I'm really scared.

727
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,410
你去哪
Where are you going?

728
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:00,680
你好
Hello?

729
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:05,180
- 是贝尔家吗  - 是贝尔家
- Is this the Bell residence?  - This is the Bell residence.

730
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:08,180
你能重打回来吗 我看不见图像
Could you call back? There's something wrong with the picture.

731
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,230
我想找苔丝・贝尔
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.

732
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,150
对不起 她几年前就过世了
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.

733
01:14:15,690 --> 01:14:19,650
- 你确定？ - 我想是的 我是她女儿
- Are you sure?  - Yeah, I think so. I'm her daughter.

734
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:21,660
能帮你什么吗
Can I help you?

735
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,970
柯里 我要和你谈谈
Gerty, I need to talk to you.

736
01:15:21,170 --> 01:15:23,050
当然 山姆 能帮你什么
Of course, Sam, how can I help?

737
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:25,140
我们发现了密室 我们也知道有其他人
We've found the hidden room. We know about the others.

738
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:28,390
那间密室 柯里
That hidden room, Gerty.

739
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:32,440
底层甲板禁止活体克隆进入 山姆
The lower deck is out-of-bounds to awakened clones, Sam.

740
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:35,650
柯里 我们需要激活一个新克隆
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.

741
01:15:35,690 --> 01:15:39,730
只有当一份三年合同完结了才能激活新克隆
New clones can only be awakened once a three-year contract is completed.

742
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:41,650
柯里 要是你再不激活一个新的
Gerty, if you don't wake up another clone,

743
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:43,400
我和另一个山姆就会死
me and the other Sam will die.

744
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,700
会被杀死 你明白吗
We will be killed, do you understand?

745
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:48,700
- 明白  - 你想看着我们被杀死吗
- Yes  - You want me and the other Sam to be killed?

746
01:15:48,830 --> 01:15:50,620
这是我最不希望看见的
That is the last thing I want.

747
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:52,620
那你就必须激活一个新克隆
Well, then you have to wake up a new clone.

748
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:54,250
好吗 伙计
OK, pal?

749
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:10,720
伊莱扎小组预计五小时后到达
Eliza arrival estimated in 5 hours.

750
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,080
怎么了 你没事吧
What's going on? You OK?

751
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,620
别 别碰他
Don't, don't touch him.

752
01:17:19,330 --> 01:17:20,460
过来
Come here.

753
01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:26,420
他还没有苏醒 柯里和我刚激活他
He's not conscious yet. Gerty and I just woke him up.

754
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:28,930
为什么 发生什么了
Why? What's going on?

755
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:30,800
我们外头谈
Come on outside.

756
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,100
当救援小组到达
When the rescue unit arrives,

757
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:40,100
他们将会在撞坏的探路车里发现一具尸体
they're going to expect to find a body in that crashed rover.

758
01:17:41,230 --> 01:17:42,690
那个人？
That guy?

759
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,030
什么 你打算杀了他？
What, are you going to kill him?

760
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:48,950
- 天啊  - 你在做什么
- Jesus Christ.  - What are you doing?

761
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:50,820
把“校门”拉拉好
Zip up your fly.

762
01:17:52,490 --> 01:17:55,700
你发烧了 出了好多汗
You're burning up. Sweating like a pig.

763
01:17:57,790 --> 01:18:01,250
帽子戴好 帽子戴好
Put your hat on. Put your hat on.

764
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:12,800
要想让计划成功
If I go through with this,

765
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,060
我需要你帮我把他拖过去
I'm going to need your help hauling him out to the crash site.

766
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:17,180
那我们呢
What about us?

767
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:19,310
当伊莱扎到达时
When Eliza arrives,

768
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:20,690
要是发现你和我在给他们开欢迎会
it finds you and me as a welcome party...

769
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:22,770
他们不会发现我们的欢迎会
They aren't going to find you and me as a welcome party.

770
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:23,610
他们只会找到我
They're going to find me.

771
01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:25,730
在他们到达前你就会踏上回乡之路
You're going back to Earth before they get here.

772
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:30,490
通过氦-3运输器 我算过了 你得承受好几个重力
In that helium-3 launcher. I did the math; you're going to pull some G's.

773
01:18:30,490 --> 01:18:32,660
但你不会有事
But you'll be fine. You'll be all right.

774
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:34,830
你会回家
You're going home.

775
01:18:35,450 --> 01:18:37,330
你干完了你的三年
You did your three years.

776
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:40,750
他们不能再把你钉死在这
They can't expect you to stick around.

777
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:44,090
也许你还能偷偷看看夏娃
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.

778
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,300
我看过视频通话了
I saw that V.P.

779
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:49,840
她真漂亮 美若仙女
She's beautiful. She's gorgeous.

780
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:51,720
你做得不错了
You did good.

781
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:53,680
击个掌！
High five!

782
01:19:03,190 --> 01:19:04,940
去吧
Go for it.

783
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,790
- 宽敞吗  - 不宽敞
- Are you comfy?  - No.

784
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:19,660
- 什么  - 不宽敞
- What?  - No!

785
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,380
要是我要拉屎咋办
What if I have to take a shit?

786
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:30,550
那 我猜你只能摒着 伙计
Well, I guess you'll just have to hold it in, pal.

787
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:32,800
摒三天？
For three days?

788
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:36,010
只能这样了
That's the way it goes.

789
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:39,350
- 要帮忙吗  - 不用
- Need a hand?  - No.

790
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:43,600
好吧
OK. All right.

791
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:46,150
我可没敌意 只是想帮你一把
No reason for hostility. I'm just trying to help out.

792
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:28,900
伊莱扎将在三小时后到达
Eliza arrival estimated in 3 hours.

793
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:01,010
嗨 我们必须这样做 要是我们等太久…
Hey, we need to do this. If we wait too long...

794
01:21:01,930 --> 01:21:03,810
另一个会苏醒
The other one's going to be conscious.

795
01:21:06,730 --> 01:21:08,310
天啦 你怎么了
What's going on with you?

796
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:11,730
我改主意了 我不回去
I changed my mind. I'm not going back.

797
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:16,860
我连腿都动不了
I don't think I can move my legs.

798
01:21:17,490 --> 01:21:18,950
还有 看看我
Besides, look at me!

799
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:20,830
要是我见到夏娃
If I meet Eve now...

800
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,160
一定会吓到她惊声尖叫
I'd scare the crap out of her!

801
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,670
你在说什么呢 她可是你女儿
What are you talking about, man? She's your daughter.

802
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:30,210
她不会在乎你的样子
She doesn't care what you look like.

803
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:36,130
你不能杀了他 我们不能杀人
You're not going to kill anybody. We can't kill anybody.

804
01:21:36,670 --> 01:21:39,180
你不会 我知道你不会 因为我也不会
You can't. I know you can't, because I can't.

805
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:41,970
换你回去吧
You go.

806
01:21:45,730 --> 01:21:47,310
你是个好人 山姆
You're a good guy, Sam.

807
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:51,690
计划也不错 除了找错了回去的人
And it was a good plan. You know, you just picked the wrong guy to go back.

808
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,620
你确定吗
Are you sure about this?

809
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:11,380
是的 你应该 你应该去旅行 知道吗
Yeah. You should, you should travel, you know?

810
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:14,420
我一直想去
I always wanted to do that.

811
01:22:16,170 --> 01:22:17,550
阿姆斯特丹或者…
Amsterdam or...

812
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:22,850
是啊 我在想夏威夷或者…墨西哥
Yeah, I was thinking about Hawaii or maybe... Mexico.

813
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:24,930
[夏威夷语：你好]
啊喽哈
Aloha!

814
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:29,100
记得帮我带杯椰汁凤梨朗姆酒 伙计
Bring me back a pina colada. All right, pal?

815
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:18,030
[酒原名：johnny walker]
嗨 太空威士忌
Hey, Johnny Spaceman?

816
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:23,240
你还记得和苔丝的那次面试吗
Do you remember when Tess came in for that interview?

817
01:23:24,490 --> 01:23:26,580
她真美
She was so beautiful.

818
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:30,540
她不是最好的候选人 但这不重要
She wasn't the best candidate, but it didn't matter...

819
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:33,670
我不得不给她那份工作
I had to give her the job.

820
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:36,590
我想把她留在美国
I wanted to keep her in the country.

821
01:23:38,130 --> 01:23:40,210
结果她还是回爱尔兰了
She was going back to Ireland.

822
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:46,050
你知道 这时候你得赌一把
And you knew you had to take a chance.

823
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:49,390
所以…你打电话给她…
So... you called her...

824
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:51,520
你自己都被你留在答录机上的
You were terrified with that whole speech

825
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,640
那套豪言壮语吓到了
for the answering machine...

826
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:54,520
但其实用不着 因为她接电话了
but you didn't need it, because she picked up the phone.

827
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:57,020
她就好像在说“为什么他给我打电话”
She was like, "Why is he calling me?"

828
01:23:57,650 --> 01:24:00,570
“面试结束了 为什么他往我家打电话”
"The internship is over. Why is he calling me at home?"

829
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:05,490
然后我问她想不想吃甜筒
I asked her if she wanted to get an ice cream cone

830
01:24:05,490 --> 01:24:07,660
还提了些类似的蠢建议
or something dorky like that.

831
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:10,660
她却说“一起去喝一杯吧”
She said, "Let's get a drink. "

832
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,250
我说“好” 我们…
I said, "OK." We...

833
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:07,090
山姆 这不管用
Sam, this is not going to work.

834
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:09,220
为什么
Why?

835
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:12,220
我已经记录下了从你被激活的所有活动
I have recorded everything that has taken place since your awakening.

836
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:15,470
要是有人检查我的记忆存储器
If anyone were to check my memory cache,

837
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:17,260
你就会陷入极其危险的境地
it would put you in considerable danger.

838
01:27:21,190 --> 01:27:23,520
但你可以格式化我的记忆库
You could erase my memory banks.

839
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:26,320
我可以设定在你离开后再重启
I could reboot myself once you have departed.

840
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:28,320
那样你会没事吧？
Are you okay with that?

841
01:27:28,530 --> 01:27:30,240
我的使命就是保证你的安全 山姆
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.

842
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:31,820
我想帮你^_^
I want to help you.

843
01:27:42,870 --> 01:27:46,210

01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:02,690
我设定…设定主机在…
I set your... I set your computer to reboot...

846
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:06,940
- 我被发射后重启  - 我明白 山姆
- the moment that I launch.  - I understand, Sam.

847
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:08,480
你应该会没事
You should be OK.

848
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:11,740
我希望地球上的生活如你所愿
I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be.

849
01:28:14,030 --> 01:28:15,280
谢谢你 柯里
Thanks, Gerty.

850

- Are you going to be OK?  - Of course.

851
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:22,120
一旦我完成了重启
The new Sam and I will be back to our programming

852
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:23,830
新的山姆和我会继续按编程行事
as soon as I have finished rebooting.

853
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:30,630
柯里 我们不是程序 我们是人 明白吗
Gerty, we're not programmed. We're people. Understand?

854
01:28:34,090 --> 01:28:35,050
“踹我啊”
KICK ME

855
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,120

嗨 山姆
Hey, Sam?

You OK, buddy?

862
01:30:38,670 --> 01:30:40,340
“骑兵”增援到了

863
