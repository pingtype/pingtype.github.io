1
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,870
Replacement team's here, sir.

2
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,080
Right.

3
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,240
Come on through.

4
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,410
20 minutes and we were gonna
start looking for you.

5
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,040
Yeah. It's really something out there.

6
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,210
- You look a mess, sir.
- Yeah?

7
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,370
Your turn next, Ginsburg.

8
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,170
OK. I'll see you in 24.

9
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,010
See you tomorrow.

10
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,760
What was that you were you saying?

11
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,550
You used to hear her chant
all night long. Om mahneypod me om.

12
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,140
- Om mahneypod me om.
- Over the plants?

13
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,560
She'd cup her hands over those seeds
and chant by the hour.

14
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,770
She grew the most beautiful
wandoos you ever saw, man.

15
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,930
Primo stuff. Resin city.

16
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,980
Stand clear.

17
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,990
The commander's been worried
about you. The roads must be a bear.

18
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,320
- What roads?
- Visibility.

19
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:19,160
Visibility? Bullshit. You guys haven't
been on time for the last six months.

20
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,990
- I wrote you guys up in the logbook.
- Yeah. You're a prince, Bevan.

21
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,830
Good night, gentlemen!

22
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,750
So, that was like sinsemilia, right?

23
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,590
Sinsemilla. This grass made
Thai stick taste like oregano.

24
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,760
Lay you out flat, man.

25
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,010
- Got a red light, sir.
- What on?

26
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,180
Number eight. Warhead alarm.

27
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,550
Give it a thump with your finger.

28
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,220
Alarm reset.

29
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,860
Skybird, this is Dropkick with
a Red dash Alpha message in two parts.

30
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,030
Break. Break. Red dash Alpha.

31
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,740
- Stand by to copy message.
- Standing by.

32
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,160
Romeo OscarNovember Charlie

33
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,870
Tango Tango Lima Alpha.

34
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:40,290
Authentication: 220040 Delta

35
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,000
Lima.

36
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,170
I have a valid message.
Stand by to authenticate.

37
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,750
I agree with authentication also, sir.

38
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,180
- Enter launch code.
- Entering launch code.

39
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,770
- Launch order confirmed.
- Holy shit!

40
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,060
Target selection: complete.
Time on target sequence: complete.

41
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,570
- Yield selection: complete.
- Begin countdown. Tminus 60.

42
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,780
- All right. Let's do it. Insert launch key.
- Stand by.

43
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,490
- Launch key inserted.
- Roger.

44
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,860
On my mark... rotate launch key to Set.

45
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,570
Three... two... one...

46
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,700
- Mark.
- Tminus 50.

47
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,830
Roger. At Set.

48
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,750
- Sir?
- Tminus 40.

49
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,340
- Enable missiles.
- Number one enabled. Two enabled.

50
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,760
- Three enabled.
- Get somebody on the goddamn phone.

51
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,090
Seven... eight...

52
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,090
Nine...

53
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,520
Ten. All missiles enabled.

54
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,850
- Get me Wing Command Post. Direct line.
- That's not the correct procedure.

55
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,350
- Try SAC Headquarters on the HF.
- That's not the procedure.

56
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,770
I want somebody on the goddamn phone
before I kill 20 million people.

57
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,190
T minus 20.

58
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,230
I got nothin' here! They might
have been knocked out already.

59
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,940
Right.

60
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,280
On my mark,
rotate launch keys to Launch.

61
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,660
Roger. Ready to go to Launch.

62
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,110
- Fourteen...
- Thirteen... twelve...

63
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,570
Eleven...

64
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,080
Seven... six...

65
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,540
- Five...
- Sir, we have a launch order.

66
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,790
- Three... two...
- Put your hand on the key, sir.

67
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,790
One... Launch!

68
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,960
- Sir, we are at launch! Turn your key!
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

69
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,710
Turn your key, sir!

70
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,190
They're cleared. Go ahead and open it up.

71
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:23,280
- Hello. I'm Pat Healy.
- I'm Lyle Watson. This is Arthur Cabot.

72
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:28,080
I'm Pat Healy, Dr McKittrick's assistant.
I've got some passes for you here.

73
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,080
We had scheduled a meeting
pending your arrival.

74
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,910
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask me.

75
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,160
I'd be happy to fill you in
if there's any way I can.

76
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,820
They're here.

77
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,530
Good.

78
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,160
Let's go.

79
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,370
Cabot and Watson came alone.
No senators. No congressmen.

80
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,870
I wish they'd brought a few senators.
I'd like to tell 'em what's going on here.

81
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,670
John, please! Don't start that right away.

82
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,420
I had them on the phone
and they're calmed down.

83
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:59,750
Well, are we positive that these men had
no way of knowing this was only a test?

84
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,550
Lyle, for God's sakes! How many times
are we gonna go through this?

85
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,090
- It doesn't make any difference.
- I've spoken to these men.

86
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,550
They all believed it was the real deal.

87
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,430
Look, we gotta be on a plane
in less than an hour.

88
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,720
I have to explain to the president
why 22% of his missile commanders

89
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,600
failed to launch their missiles. What
am I supposed to say? 22% isn't so bad?

90
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,440
The president knows that I am fully
responsible for the men in my command.

91
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,480
I've ordered a re-evaluation of
our psychological screening procedure.

92
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,980
Wait a minute. Excuse me, General.

93
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:36,190
We can't ask these men
to go back to the president

94
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,610
with a lot of headshrinker horseshit!
You can't screen out human response!

95
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:45,530
Those men know what it means to turn
the keys, and some are just not up to it!

96
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,360
Now, it's as simple as that!

97
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,790
I think we oughta take
the men out of the loop.

98
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,500
- Mr McKittrick, you're out of line, sir.
- Why am I out of line?

99
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,160
Excuse me!

100
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,920
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
Take them out of the loop?

101
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,790
Gentlemen! We've had men in these silos

102
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,500
since before any of you
were watching Howdy Doody.

103
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,510
For myself, I sleep pretty well at night
knowing those boys are down there.

104
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:22,760
General, we know they're fine men,
but in a nuclear war we can't afford

105
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,630
to have missiles
lying dormant in those silos

106
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,600
because those men refuse to turn
the keys when the computers tell 'em to!

107
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,970
You mean when
the president orders them to.

108
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,810
The president will probably follow
the computer war plan. That's a fact!

109
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,690
I imagine the Joint Chiefs
will have some input.

110
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,440
- You're damn tootin'.
- Well, hell...

111
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,060
In a surprise attack, there's no time.

112
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,730
23 minutes from warning to impact.

113
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,020
- Six minutes if it's sub-launched.
- Six minutes.

114
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,990
That's barely enough time
for the president to make a decision.

115
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,030
Once he makes the decision,
the computer should take over.

116
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,910
Now, sir, I know that you've got
a plane waiting for you,

117
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,570
but if you could indulge me,
I'd like to show you something.

118
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,370
These computers give instant access
to the state of the world.

119
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,960
Troop movements, Soviet
missile tests, weather patterns.

120
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,920
It all flows into this room,
and then into the WOPR computer.

121
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,590
- WOPR? What is that?
- War Operation Plan Response.

122
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,550
This is Mr Richter.

123
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:33,510
Paul, would you like to tell
these gentlemen about the WOPR?

124
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:38,180
Well, the WOPR spends all its time
thinking about World War Ill.

125
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:45,510
24 hours a day, 365 days a year,
it plays an endless series of war games

126
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,220
using all available information
on the state of the world.

127
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,230
The WOPR has already fought
World War Ill, as a game,

128
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,390
time and time again.

129
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,730
It estimates Soviet responses
to our responses

130
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,150
to their responses, and so on.

131
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,860
Estimates damage. Counts the dead.

132
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,740
Then it looks for ways
to improve its score...

133
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,320
The point is that the key decisions

134
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,570
of every option have already
been made by the WOPR.

135
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,370
So all this trillion-dollar hardware
is really at the mercy

136
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,870
of those men with the little brass keys?

137
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,740
That's exactly right. Whose only problem
is that they're human beings.

138
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:27,670
But in 30 days we could put in electronic
relays. Get the men out of the loop.

139
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,420
Gentlemen...

140
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,210
I wouldn't trust this overgrown pile of
microchips further than I could throw it.

141
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:40,960
I don't know if you wanna trust the safety
of our country to some... silicon diode...

142
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,710
Nobody is talking about entrusting
the safety of the nation

143
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,880
to a machine, for God's sake!

144
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,050
We'll keep control,
but here at the top where it belongs.

145
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,550
All right, gentlemen.

146
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,850
I think I'm going to recommend
McKittrick's idea to the president.

147
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,470
And I'll get back to you on this.

148
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,350
You won't regret this.

149
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,700
OK. You had fries and a Coke, right?

150
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,330
Damn!

151
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,840
- Hi, David!
- Hi, Howie!

152
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,960
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

153
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,340
- You wanna take this over? I gotta go.
- Sure!

154
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,510
- Go ahead.
- Thanks!

155
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,220
- Bye, David!
- Bye!

156
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:22,690
All right. Question number two.

157
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:30,690
Seeds that are germinated in water
before they are planted will... what?

158
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,150
- Robert?
- Sprout roots?

159
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,990
Ah! David!

160
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:39,570
Nice of you to join us.
Oh, David. I have a little present for you.

161
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,710
Question number four.
In the history of science,

162
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:57,410
novel and innovative concepts
occasionally arise

163
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,040
from sudden left-field inspiration.

164
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,920
Miss Mack...

165
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,420
Could you tell us your answer
to question number four?

166
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,050
Why do nitrogen nodules
cling to the roots of plants?

167
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,720
Love?

168
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,300
Jennifer, what do you know about
nitrogen nodules that we don't?

169
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,970
Some bit of salacious info
to which you alone are privy?

170
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,600
- No.
- I see.

171
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,020
No, you didn't know
the correct answer - symbiosis.

172
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,560
Because you don't pay attention in class.

173
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,230
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

174
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,610
There seems to be a lot of confusion on
this next question - asexual reproduction.

175
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,940
Could someone tell me, please

176
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:55,450
who first suggested the idea
of reproduction without sex?

177
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,330
- Miss Mack!
- Yes?

178
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:08,080
What is so amusing?

179
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,500
What?

180
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,330
All right, Lightman.

181
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:20,670
Maybe you can tell us who first suggested
the idea of reproduction without sex.

182
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,170
Your wife?

183
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,590
Get out, Lightman! Get out!

184
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,770
Mr Ligget wants me to discuss
my attitude problem with Mr Kessler.

185
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,270
I think Mr Kessler's getting tired
of your attitude problem.

186
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,020
Me, too.

187
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,250
Lightman. What a... surprise.

188
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,420
Won't you come in?

189
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,420
Hi!

190
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,590
Hi!

191
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,760
Sorry if I got you in trouble.
I couldn't stop laughing.

192
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,930
That's OK. You were perfect.

193
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,100
- I was?
- Yeah.

194
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,270
- You want a ride home?
- Yeah.

195
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,440
Hop on.

196
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,900
- So you got an F on that test today, too?
- Yep.

197
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,820
Guess we're both gonna be
stuck in summer school.

198
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,860
- Not me.
- Why not? You have to make up biology.

199
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,940
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

200
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:19,650
- Why not? Come on! Tell me. Why not?
- Make a left.

201
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,910
Why don't you come up to my house
and I'll show you?

202
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,080
What are you gonna show me?

203
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,410
I'm gonna show you.
I'll show you how you do it.

204
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,540
- Hi, Bo!
- Oh! Hi, Bo!

205
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,710
Hey, Bo! How you doin'?

206
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,260
My room's upstairs.

207
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,470
- Your parents aren't home?
- No. They both work.

208
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,730
A little mess.

209
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,900
It's OK. You should see my room.

210
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,280
- You're really into computers, huh?
- Yeah.

211
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:41,040
- What are you doing?
- I'm dialling into the school's computer.

212
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:58,040
They change the password every couple
of weeks, but I know where they write it.

213
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,720
- Are those your grades?!
- Yeah.

214
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,180
I don't think that I deserved an F, do you?

215
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,680
- You can't do that!
- Already done.

216
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:29,310
- Do you have a middle initial?
- K. Katherine.

217
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,360
Those are my grades.

218
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,280
- How can anybody get a D in home ec?
- That's none of your business.

219
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,780
- Can you erase this?
- No. It's too late.

220
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,780
What are you doing?

221
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,820
- I'm changing your biology grade.
- No. You'll get me in trouble.

222
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,910
Nobody can find out. You got a C!
Now you won't go to summer school.

223
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,160
- Change it back.
- Why? They can't...

224
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,500
- I said change it back.
- OK. OK.

225
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,590
I guess I'd better get going.

226
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,170
Thanks for the ride.

227
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,130
Yeah. OK. Bye.

228
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,300
Bye.

229
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:22,000
Get down. Get down. You've already
had your dinner. Now just sit.

230
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,210
Sit! Stay!

231
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,130
- Don't forget to take out the garbage.
- David.

232
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,130
- Put that lid on real tight.
- I know, Ma.

233
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,550
Yes, they will carry back on the second.

234
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,300
Sure. I think we can really work out
some creative financing.

235
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,180
Oh, but you've gotta see it!

236
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,060
There's a Jacuzzi
in the master bedroom...

237
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,810
Oh, sure. We can work that out.

238
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:05,030
That is true. You'll have a balloon
payment at the end of five years.

239
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,610
But that's nothing.
The economy is gonna be great then.

240
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,780
He who dances must pay the piper.

241
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,700
- See you, Dad.
- I'll meet you tomorrow at 9.30. Bye.

242
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,740
You know, I worry about that kid.

243
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,910
Why?

244
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,410
Sometimes I think
we're all gonna get electrocuted.

245
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,630
This corn is raw!

246
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,380
I know. Isn't it wonderful? It's so crisp.

247
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,380
- Of course it's crisp! It's raw!
- It's terrific!

248
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,630
You can just taste the vitamin
A and D in here. It's great.

249
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,470
Couldn't we have pills,
and cook the corn?

250
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,800
- What city, please?
- For Sunnyvale, California.

251
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,970
The number for Protovision.

252
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,350
Yes. That's 555 8632.

253
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:59,520
Thank you. Could you also tell me
what other prefixes cover that area?

254
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:05,100
There's 399, 437, 767, 936.

255
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,640
Thanks.

256
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,570
Protovision... I have you now.

257
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,170
Yes?

258
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,760
Saul's Fish Market.

259
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,970
- Hi!
- Oh, hi!

260
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,640
What?

261
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,690
I've been thinking.
That thing with my grade.

262
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,480
- Can you still change it?
- Oh, I don't know...

263
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,400
I can't believe I was so stupid.
I should've just let you do it.

264
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,610
- I don't know. It might be kinda rough.
- Why?

265
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:30,070
They might have changed the password.

266
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,780
Maybe they didn't. Can't we at least try?

267
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,150
- Damn!
- Please.

268
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,700
OK.

269
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:44,490
- You owe me a quarter.
- Yeah. Come on. Sorry I lost your game.

270
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,830
- What's it doing?
- Oh. It's dialling numbers.

271
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,790
- Don't touch the keys!
- I'm not touching the keys.

272
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,420
Excuse me.

273
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:09,010
This computer company's coming out
with these amazing new games soon.

274
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:12,050
The programs are probably
still on their computer.

275
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,840
So I told my system to search for other
computers in Sunnyvale, California.

276
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:25,010
They answer with a tone that other
computers can recognise. You hear?

277
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,600
You're calling every number
in Sunnyvale?

278
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,770
- Isn't that expensive?
- There's ways around that.

279
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,600
You can go to jail for that.

280
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,860
Only if you're over 18.

281
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:44,400
Is this going to take a long time?
I'd like to get my grade changed.

282
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,280
Oh. That's funny, actually.

283
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,450
Cos...

284
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,740
I already changed it.

285
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,200
- I told you not to do that.
- Yeah, I know.

286
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,410
But I figured you'd change your mind.
I didn't want you to flunk.

287
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,870
- Well, what did I get?
- You got a D.

288
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:06,460
- You gave me a D?
- No. You got an A.

289
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,580
- I was kidding.
- Oh.

290
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,880
Well, that's OK.

291
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,210
Here. Let's see what we have so far.

292
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,960
Excuse me.

293
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,130
Did you really give me an A?

294
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,300
Yeah.

295
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,550
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

296
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,550
Hey! You got a bank!

297
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,800
Gotta make a note of that one.
Might come in handy someday.

298
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,810
Pan Am.

299
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,810
- Where shall we go?
- Anywhere?

300
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,980
- Anywhere.
- New York?

301
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,940
- New York. OK.
- No, Paris. Paris.

302
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,150
Will you be travelling alone?

303
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,030
Yeah... No. You wanna go with me?

304
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,650
OK.

305
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:06,160
- All right. Smoking or nonsmoking?
- Nonsmoking.

306
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:12,160
All right, Miss Mack. You're
confirmed on Pan Am's flight 1 14

307
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,250
Ieaving Chicago's O'Hare Airport
at 8.15am on 18 August.

308
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,870
Do we need a rental car? No.

309
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,620
- Do we really have tickets to Paris?
- No. You have a reservation though.

310
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,340
It doesn't identify itself.

311
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,760
Try anything.

312
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,680
"Connection terminated." How rude.

313
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,850
We'll ask it for help.

314
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:50,180
- Can you do that?
- On some systems.

315
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:54,480
The more complicated they are,
the more they have to help you out.

316
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,610
Now what?

317
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,480
Help games.

318
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,570
"Games" refers to models,
simulations and games

319
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,860
which have strategic applications.
What does that mean?

320
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:21,080
I don't know. That's gotta be them.
Turn on the printer.

321
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,700
List games.

322
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,970
Oh, my God!

323
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,270
So these guys can tell you
what that print-out means?

324
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,310
They probably invented it
in the first place.

325
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,610
- Can you wait here?
- Why?

326
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,660
- Cos these guys can get a little nervous.
- OK.

327
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:41,950
Jim.

328
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,200
Oh. Lightman.

329
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,250
Hi, Lightman!

330
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:51,420
I want you to take a look at this.

331
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,710
- Hey! What's that?
- I wanted Jim to see that.

332
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,180
Wow! Where'd you get this?

333
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,850
Protovision. I wanted to see
the program for their new games.

334
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,430
- Can I have this?
- I'm not through yet.

335
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,680
Remember you told me to tell you when
you were acting rudely and insensitively?

336
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,730
You're doing it right now.

337
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,900
"Theatrewide biotoxic
and chemical warfare."

338
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:36,030
- This didn't come from Protovision.
- Ask him where it did come from, Jim!

339
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:39,280
- I told you already.
- Looks military to me. Definitely.

340
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,410
- Probably classified, too.
- If it's military, why does it have games

341
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:47,820
- Iike checkers and backgammon?
- Those games teach basic strategy.

342
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:51,160
Jim, how do I get into that system?
I wanna play those games.

343
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,540
That system probably contains
the new data encryption algorithm.

344
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:59,420
- You'll never get in.
- No system is totally secure.

345
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,000
- I bet you Jim could get in.
- I bet you he couldn't!

346
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,670
- I bet you he could.
- You won't get through frontline security.

347
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:09,250
- But you might look for a back door.
- I can't believe it, Jim!

348
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,420
That girl's listening,
and you talk about back doors!

349
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,720
Mr Potato-head.

350
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,760
Mr Potato-head!
Back doors are not secrets!

351
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,800
- You're giving away all our best tricks.
- They're not tricks.

352
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:23,930
- What's a back door?
- Whenever I design a system

353
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:26,550
I put in a password
that only I know about.

354
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,430
That way, whenever I wanna get back in,

355
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:34,310
I can bypass whatever security they've
added on. That's basically what it is.

356
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,350
Yeah?

357
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,110
OK. You really wanna get in, find out
about the guy who designed the system.

358
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,480
Come on! I don't even
know the guy's name.

359
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:48,690
Boy, are you guys dumb! You guys are
so dumb. I got this thing all figured out.

360
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,440
Oh, yeah, Malvin? How would you do it?

361
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:55,700
The first game in the list.
Go right through Falken's Maze.

362
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,680
Hi! I'm Jennifer.

363
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,850
- Is David here?
- How do you do?

364
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,020
Yeah. He's up in his room.

365
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,270
Thanks.

366
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,190
Have you ever heard
of the word tumulus?

367
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,150
Tumulus? No. I haven't. I'm sorry.

368
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,320
Neither have l.

369
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,610
Yeah?

370
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:24,990
Hi!

371
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,950
- Where have you been?
- What?

372
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,290
I haven't seen you all week in school.
Are you sick?

373
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,290
No, no. I was...

374
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:38,580
I was doing things.
You wanna sit down? How are you?

375
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,290
- No. I'm going to get some water, OK?
- OK.

376
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,040
- What is all that stuff?
- Oh, it's nothing. I was just...

377
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:49,340
I was trying to find out about the guy
who designed those game programs,

378
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,840
so I could get his secret password.

379
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,590
- Why?
- Why? Cos...

380
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,930
What's so special about playing
games with some machine?

381
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,260
Oh, no...

382
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,590
No, it's not just some machine.

383
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,140
Here. Look at this.

384
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,850
This is a tape that I got from the library.

385
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:09,060
It's about this guy named Falken.

386
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,480
He was into games as well as computers.

387
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,400
He designed them so that
they could play checkers or poker.

388
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,900
- Chess.
- What's so great about that?

389
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,650
- Everybody's doing that now.
- Oh, no, no. What he did was great!

390
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:27,230
He designed his computer
so it could learn from its mistakes.

391
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,030
So they'd be better
the next time they played.

392
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,860
The system actually learned how to learn.

393
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,820
It could teach itself.

394
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:40,780
If I could just get that damn password,
I could play the computer.

395
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:45,620
That's him. That's Falken.

396
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:50,000
That's him? Wow!

397
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,160
He's amazing-looking!

398
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,330
Can't you write to him
or call him somehow?

399
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,840
No. He's dead.

400
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,840
- He's dead?
- Yeah.

401
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,090
Here. Look. Here's his obituary.

402
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:08,340
- He wasn't very old.
- Well, he was pretty old. He was 41 .

403
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:11,260
Oh, yeah? Oh, that's old.

404
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:16,050
That's his little boy.

405
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,220
Oh, yeah?

406
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:23,560
This is really sad. Did you know the child
and his mother were killed in a car crash?

407
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,850
- I know.
- "ln the years that followed

408
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:30,100
the tragic loss of his family,
Dr Falken's health deteriorated."

409
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,150
My dad is 45.

410
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,530
- Once he was really sick...
- What was his name?

411
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:50,110
- My father?
- No, no, no. Falken's kid.

412
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,160
Joshua.

413
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,330
It can't be that simple.

414
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:08,000
- Wow!
- What?

415
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,040
We got something.

416
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,760
We're in!

417
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,430
It thinks I'm Falken!

418
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,840
Hello.

419
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:36,600
- How can it ask you that?
- It'll ask whatever it's programmed to.

420
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,770
- Do you wanna hear it talk?
- Yeah!

421
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,520
I'll ask it how it feels.

422
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:47,520
I'm fine. How are... you?

423
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:51,980
Excellent. It's been a long time.

424
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:59,490
Can you explain the removal of
your useraccount on June 23rd, 1973?

425
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:01,650
They must have told it he died.

426
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:08,870
People sometimes make... mistakes.

427
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,700
- Yes, they do.
- How can it talk?

428
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:17,040
It's not a real voice. This box interprets
signals and turns them into sound.

429
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,660
Shall we play a game?

430
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,210
Oh!

431
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:25,210
- I think it missed him.
- Yeah. Weird, isn't it?

432
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:27,000
Love to!

433
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:33,340
How about Global Thermonuclear War?

434
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:38,590
Wouldn't you prefer
a good game ofchess?

435
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,720
Later.

436
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,930
Let's play

437
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:45,220
Global Thermonuclear War.

438
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,180
Fine.

439
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,890
All right!

440
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,770
Wow!

441
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:57,440
Which side do you want?

442
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,610
I'll be the Russians.

443
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,280
Please listprimary targets.

444
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,860
- Who shall we nuke first?
- Let's see.

445
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:14,780
How about... Las Vegas?

446
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,370
Las Vegas! Great!

447
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,740
- What next? Seattle!
- Yeah!

448
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,030
Kill 'em!

449
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:39,420
I have seven, correction, eight Red birds
two degrees past apogee.

450
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,710
Better get the old man down here.

451
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,960
We have Soviet missile warning.

452
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:48,590
Check formalfunction
and report confiidence.

453
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,970
Projected target areas
NORAD regions 25, 26.

454
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:11,270
This is Crystal Palace initiating
emergency conference. Stand by!

455
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,480
19 degrees past apogee.

456
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:21,030
Possible 18 targets in track.
Estimate re-entry at 19.23 Zulu.

457
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,240
- What you got up here, Joe?
- We have a radar tracking.

458
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:35,620
Eight inbound Soviet ICBMs
already over the pole.

459
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:39,500
Estimated impact: 1 1 minutes.
Target area: Western United States.

460
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:43,960
- Why didn't we get a launch detection?
- We're checking for DSP malfunction.

461
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,830
BMEWS has continuous radar tracking
on inbounds.

462
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:52,040
Confidence is high.
I repeat, confidence is high.

463
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:00,340
- What is all that stuff?
- Trajectory headings

464
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:04,010
- for multiple-impact re-entry vehicles.
- What does that mean?

465
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:06,180
I don't know. But it's great!

466
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,140
- Are those bombs? Which is the bombs?
- Subs.

467
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,510
- Blow 'em up.
- Blow 'em out of the water.

468
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,350
- What's a trajectory heading?
- I've no idea.

469
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:22,810
The president's diverting to Andrews.
The vice president is out of position.

470
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:28,230
- The chairman of the Joint Chiefs is on...
- Missile warning reports no malfunction.

471
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,400
Take us to DEFCON 3.

472
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,280
Get onto SAC.
Tell 'em to flush the bombers.

473
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,780
Yes, sir.

474
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:40,740
SAC, this is Crystal Palace.
CinC NORAD has declared DEFCON 3.

475
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:45,870
Scramble all alert aircraft.
I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.

476
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,030
Inbounds presently MIRVing.

477
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,780
We now have approximately
24 possible targets in track.

478
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:56,330
- New time to impact: eight minutes.
- SAC is launching the bombers.

479
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:59,210
- General Powers is on the line.
- Beringer.

480
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:04,630
Goddamn it! We didn't get
a launch detection from our satellite.

481
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:10,000
Radar picked 'em up already out of the
atmosphere. That's the first we heard of it.

482
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:13,960
Get the ICBMs in the bullpen
warmed up and ready to fly.

483
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:17,970
- Get me the president on the horn.
- Yes, sir.

484
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:27,640
Mr President? This is Beringer at NORAD.

485
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:29,810
Oh, attack!

486
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:33,690
- I wonder if I should use my subs.
- Sure. Give 'em the works.

487
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:35,850
David!

488
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,270
Excuse me.

489
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,440
David!

490
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:45,360
How many times have I told you
to fasten these lids on tight?!

491
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,360
- Look at this mess!
- I'll be down in a few minutes.

492
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,200
Now! Come down now!
I want this cleared up now!

493
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,410
Come down here and do what
your father asks you to pronto, David.

494
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:58,160
We're gonna barbecue tonight.

495
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,580
- You wanna invite your little friend?
- Please!

496
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,780
David!

497
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,080
Shit!

498
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,960
Little friend.

499
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:27,210
Mr President, something's happening.
I'll get back to you as soon as I know.

500
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:32,590
- What's happening, Joe?
- BMEWS and Cobra Dane now report

501
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,010
negative confirmation
on all inbound tracking.

502
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:39,800
Get onto SAC. Tell 'em to hold steady.

503
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,600
Stop! It's a simulation!
There's an attack simulation running!

504
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:48,180
What the hell's he yelling about?
I didn't order that.

505
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:51,190
We're not being attacked!
It's a simulation!

506
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:52,980
Whoa, now! Hold it!

507
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,320
You're not supposed to be runnin' here.

508
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,480
We don't know how it happened.

509
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:01,520
Someone outside fed an attack simulation
into the main... It's a simulation!

510
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:03,190
Conley...

511
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,190
Take us off full alert.

512
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:10,120
Hold at DEFCON 4 till we find out exactly
what in the hell's happening here!

513
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,660
I didn't tell you to cut the line!
Did I tell you to cut it? You cut the line!

514
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,530
They shut down
before we could complete our trace.

515
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:20,830
We did locate the area
where the transmission originated.

516
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:23,000
- Where?
- Seattle, Washington.

517
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,000
Shut it down!

518
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,330
Somebody's playing a game with us.

519
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:30,000
At a prophylactic recycling centre...

520
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,130
Hi, Dad!

521
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,210
David!

522
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,210
- David, come in here!
- What did I do?

523
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,380
Plenty, mister. Plenty.

524
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:43,680
You have just passed
all of your classes this semester.

525
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,840
Congratulations, dear!

526
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,010
Show this to your dad.

527
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:51,470
Honey! David has something to show you.

528
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,640
- What's that?
- Here, Dad.

529
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,600
Uh-oh.

530
00:46:57,890 --> 00:46:59,940
This is good!

531
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,100
I'm so proud of you!

532
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:04,520
..went on a full-scale nuclearalert,

533
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:07,810
believing the Soviet Union
had launched a missile attack.

534
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:11,400
A spokesman places blame
on a computermalfunction,

535
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,610
emphasising that the problem
has been corrected.

536
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:18,070
For more on the story,
let's go live to Washington DC.

537
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,820
Well, that's your phone.

538
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:24,990
Yeah.

539
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,280
Seriously, David. Congratulations.
This one'll be a pleasure to sign!

540
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,500
- Hello?
- David?

541
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,420
Are you watching the news?

542
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,130
Jennifer. Yeah, I'm watching.

543
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,920
David, is that us on TV? Did we do that?

544
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,500
It could be. Oh, Jesus, Jennifer!

545
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:51,800
What am I gonna do? They're gonna
come get me. I'm really screwed!

546
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,970
I'm screwed!

547
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:57,880
No! Sh! Calm down!
Sh! Calm down, calm down. Listen...

548
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:00,930
If they were so smart,
they would have found you already.

549
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:02,050
Yeah.

550
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:06,600
OK. So all you have to do is throw
the number away and don't call it again.

551
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,970
- That's all.
- Yeah.

552
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:13,060
- Maybe they didn't trace the call.
- Right! Maybe they didn't trace the call.

553
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:17,100
I'm sure they didn't trace the call.
All you have to do is act normal.

554
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:20,150
We'll both act normal
and everything will be fine.

555
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:21,570
OK?

556
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,730
- OK.
- OK.

557
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:28,480
God! This is so unbelievable!
Can I call Michelle and tell her?

558
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:30,740
No, Jennifer! Don't call her!

559
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:34,740
Sorry. All right. I won't.
I'll talk to you tomorrow, OK?

560
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:37,280
OK. Good night, Jennifer.

561
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,640
Greetings, ProfessorFalken.

562
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:13,390
Oh, my God.

563
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:25,100
Incorrect identification.

564
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:27,560
I am not Falken.

565
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:30,730
Falken is dead.

566
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,980
Sorry to hear that, Professor.

567
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:37,570
Yesterday's game was interrupted.

568
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:43,650
Although primary goal has not yet
been achieved, solution is near.

569
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:49,200
Game time elapsed:
31 hours 12 minutes 50 seconds.

570
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:56,370
Estimated time remaining:
52 hours 17 minutes 10 seconds.

571
00:49:56,490 --> 00:50:00,910
What is the primary goal?

572
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,920
You should know, Professor.
You programmed me.

573
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,080
Oh, come on.

574
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,920
What is the primary goal?

575
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,210
To win the game.

576
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,760
David Lightman, hold it right there. FBl.

577
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:50,520
- I'll read you your rights.
- Step over to the van.

578
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,430
You have the absolute right
to remain silent.

579
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,600
What did I do?

580
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:58,230
You have the right
to consult with an attorney

581
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:00,690
and to have one present
during questioning.

582
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:04,610
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed to you by the court.

583
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:07,190
- Do you understand these rights?
- Yeah.

584
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,900
Are you willing to talk to me
about the charges against you?

585
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:13,070
All right. Let's move.

586
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:28,460
This rather large room
is command centre for NORAD.

587
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:33,080
No picture taking. The screens in front
of you are connected to our satellites

588
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:36,420
and missile tracking stations
throughout the country.

589
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,670
This is the commander's desk.
Colonel Conley is in charge.

590
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,550
Would you mind relinquishing
your command, sir?

591
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:46,550
Miss Dailey, would you come
and sit in this rather important chair?

592
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:50,220
These buttons are connected
with the Strategic Air Command

593
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:52,430
and missile launching stations.

594
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:55,930
Miss Dailey, would you press
this button here? The red one.

595
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:58,010
- The one in the middle?
- Yes, ma'am.

596
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,600
Oh, my God! It's the wrong one!

597
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,310
It's a joke! You didn't blow up anything.
Look what you did do.

598
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:07,310
"Distinguished visitors
from Birmingham."

599
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,160
Last week I had the governor
of New Jersey in this chair.

600
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:44,460
He said, "Colonel Thomas, why are we
at DEFCON 4?" as we are right now.

601
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,630
Why are we at DEFCON 4?

602
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:49,670
The Soviets saw our bombers scramble
and went on alert.

603
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:54,710
We told them it was just an exercise, but
we want them to relax their posture first.

604
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,090
Wait. Wait.

605
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:58,710
- Give me that.
- Oh, Christ. Another tour group.

606
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,970
Just what we need today. Why don't they
go to Disneyland where they belong?

607
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:07,260
- Well, I think they're going to tomorrow.
- OK. All set? Oh, here.

608
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:12,470
It was a one-in-a-million shot.

609
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,430
There was an open line
at our division in Sunnyvale.

610
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,600
The phone company screwed up!

611
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:20,730
- John. John McKittrick, George Wigan.
- How are you?

612
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:23,350
George is with the FBl.
He brought the kid in.

613
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,730
It looks like we've got
a high-school prank on our hands.

614
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,690
Paul, what happened?

615
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:33,570
The kid broke into the war game using a
password left by the original programmer.

616
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:35,280
- A password?
- Yes, sir.

617
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,450
None of my team even knew it was there.

618
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:40,280
Kid claims
he was looking for a toy company.

619
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:43,660
That's great!
Anybody in here buy that one?

620
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:48,660
We can find the password and take it out,
but it might help to beef up security.

621
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:50,790
Oh. Beef up, huh?

622
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,000
How about screwed up?

623
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,790
We did all that and he broke in again.

624
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:58,670
Kid says your computer called him.

625
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:01,420
What the hell is going on, John?

626
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:05,630
I woke up the president. I told him
we were under attack by the Russians.

627
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:09,920
You know what an idiot that makes me
look? Not to mention the general.

628
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:12,210
I think we're being a little naive here.

629
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:14,380
There is no way a high-school punk

630
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:17,510
can put a dime in a telephone
and break into our system.

631
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,970
He's got to be working
with somebody else.

632
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:23,930
He fits the profile perfectly.
He's intelligent, but an underachiever.

633
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:26,850
Alienated from his parents.
Has few friends.

634
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:29,470
Classic case
for recruitment by the Soviets.

635
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,310
What does this say
about the state of our country?

636
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:36,980
I mean, have you gotten any insight
as to why a bright boy like this

637
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,440
would jeopardise the lives of millions?

638
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,780
He says
he does this sort of thing for fun.

639
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:45,280
Dammit, John, I want some answers,
and I want 'em now!

640
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:52,400
- Let me talk to this little prick.
- I don't wanna talk. Just do it!

641
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:56,160
Come on, Paul.

642
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:01,870
Who do they belong to? Do you know?

643
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:03,370
What?

644
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:04,750
Good morning, sir.

645
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:08,000
- Where's the Lightman kid?
- In the infirmary, sir.

646
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:21,210
Hello, David. John McKittrick.
I run the computer facility here.

647
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:24,050
Sergeant, these aren't necessary,
the handcuffs?

648
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:25,630
No, sir.

649
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,010
Well, David, we called your parents.

650
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:32,470
We told them everything's fine.

651
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:35,470
No charges have been filed... yet.

652
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:40,350
But I think we are gonna need
a little time to sort things out here.

653
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:42,310
How much time?

654
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:45,810
Well, that depends on
how willing you are to cooperate.

655
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:48,020
Oh, of course.

656
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,610
Sergeant, would you tell the OD
I'm gonna take David for a little walk?

657
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:57,400
Let's go down to my office.
We'll be more comfortable there.

658
00:56:57,530 --> 00:56:59,570
Go ahead.

659
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:06,200
You used to work with Stephen Falken?

660
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,820
I started as his assistant.
How d'you know?

661
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:12,320
I read an article you wrote with him
on poker and nuclear war.

662
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:14,870
Bluffing. Yeah,
that shook a few people up.

663
00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:19,120
- He must have been pretty amazing.
- He's a brilliant man. A little flaky.

664
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:23,330
He never understood the practical uses
of his... of his work.

665
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,710
This machine over here
runs his game program.

666
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:27,920
Joshua.

667
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,170
Come here a minute, David.

668
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:36,210
See that sign up here? Up here?

669
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:38,010
- Yeah.
- DEFCON.

670
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:41,510
That indicates
our current defence condition.

671
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:44,510
It should read DEFCON 5,
which means peace.

672
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:48,220
It's still on 4 because of
that little stunt you pulled.

673
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:52,770
Actually, if we hadn't caught it in time,
it might have gone to DEFCON 1 .

674
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:56,180
- You know what that means, David?
- No. What does that mean?

675
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:57,890
World War Ill.

676
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:00,270
Wow.

677
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:03,400
You broke into our system
just to play a game, right?

678
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,900
That's right. That's exactly right.

679
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:13,150
After the news, you must have
realised how serious it was.

680
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,610
- Why'd you do it again?
- I didn't do it again.

681
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:18,650
- I even threw the number away.
- They found it in the trash.

682
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,110
Joshua called me.

683
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:22,110
Hey!

684
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,570
Look at that! That's some setup.

685
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:27,950
- What did you say?
- This is some setup.

686
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,870
No, no. Before that.

687
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,040
Joshua called me.

688
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:35,870
David, machines don't call people.

689
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:39,290
Yours did.

690
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:45,130
Who are you going to Paris with?

691
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:48,340
Paris? Oh!

692
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:50,260
No... You don't understand.

693
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:52,840
You had reservations for two to Paris.

694
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:58,350
- Who are you working with?
- Nobody!

695
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:02,430
Why don't I believe you?

696
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:09,140
I don't think I should say anything else
until I talk to a lawyer.

697
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,810
I think we'd better forget
about the lawyer crap

698
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:16,560
until I get a few answers
out of you myself.

699
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:37,120
Are you gonna answer the phone?

700
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,410
Hello.

701
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:43,790
Yeah.

702
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:44,910
What?

703
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,710
All right. I'll be right down.

704
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,750
You stay here. Don't move.

705
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,800
What's going on?

706
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,800
There's been a serious penetration
into our WOPR execution order file.

707
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,340
- What the hell's he sayin'?
- In English.

708
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:13,890
I'll give it to you. Somebody got
into Mr McKittrick's system

709
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,760
and stole the codes
that'll launch our missiles.

710
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:20,680
There's no cause for alarm.
The system won't accept a launch code

711
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:24,520
unless we're at DEFCON 1 .
I can change those codes in an hour.

712
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,100
Well, who did this?

713
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:29,140
I think the kid's working
with somebody on the outside.

714
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:33,900
I don't know what they're up to, but
I don't want our bombers on the ground.

715
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:37,230
Take us to DEFCON 3
and get SAC on the line.

716
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,860
- Where are you?
- Sir.

717
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:44,320
Get me an update on those subs. I wanna
know what those bastards are up to.

718
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:13,710
Joshua.

719
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:17,170
Greetings, ProfessorFalken.

720
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,430
Hello.

721
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:24,300
Are you still playing the game?

722
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:29,220
Of course. I should reach DEFCON 1

723
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:33,140
and launch my missiles in 28 hours.

724
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:37,770
Would you like to see
some projected kill ratios?

725
01:01:37,890 --> 01:01:40,350
69% of the housing destroyed.

726
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:43,610
72 million people dead?

727
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:50,400
Is this a game

728
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:52,650
or is it real?

729
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:54,820
What's the difference?

730
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:57,110
Oh, wow.

731
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:00,360
You are a hard man to reach.

732
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:02,530
Could not fiind you in Seattle

733
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:07,450
and no terminal is in operation
at your classifiied address.

734
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:16,710
What classified address?

735
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:22,750
DOD pension fiiles
indicate current mailing as:

736
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,420
Dr Robert Hume.

737
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:30,420
AKA Stephen WFalken.

738
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:37,510
5 Tall CedarRoad,
Goose lsland, Oregon 97...

739
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:41,640
Can I just talk to Mr McKittrick?
I think I know what's going on.

740
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,470
I'm escorting you to Denver
where you'll be placed under arrest,

741
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,520
- pending indictment for espionage.
- Espionage?!

742
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,190
Let me talk to him!
He's right over there.

743
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:55,440
- Get that bastard out of the war room!
- No! It's Joshua!

744
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,650
He's still playing the game!
He's gonna start a war!

745
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:02,020
Hold him where you had him before.
We'll leave in a few minutes.

746
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:06,240
Call Falken. He'll tell you. Please,
call him. Please, call him. Call him!

747
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,860
What the hell's he doing in here anyway?

748
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:29,040
Some of the men told me
that you're quite a tennis player.

749
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:45,580
Patient's eyes are dilated, consistent
with use ofmarijuana andpossibly PCP.

750
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:18,730
Depending on what information you want,
there's a button to press.

751
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:21,850
Let's say I wanted to find out
how to hit a backhand.

752
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:24,520
I don't think I have the right program.

753
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:27,230
Excuse me. What do you want?

754
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,740
Bathroom. It's a long ride to Denver.

755
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:31,900
Excuse me.

756
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,740
Please! Let me talk to Mr McKittrick.

757
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:42,950
You can't talk to anybody.
The FBl'll be here any minute.

758
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,490
- Do you have to take a leak or not?
- No.

759
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,970
- I'm working here.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

760
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:17,140
Stop it!

761
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:20,090
- You have pretty eyes.
- That's original.

762
01:06:25,010 --> 01:06:26,680
I'll get the elevator.

763
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:28,850
- Sign in here?
- Yeah, get us all.

764
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:55,620
I heard they voted you
Miss Fine in 1979. Is that true?

765
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:57,780
Will you stop it?!

766
01:06:57,910 --> 01:06:59,950
- Am I bothering you?
- Yes.

767
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:02,700
- Do you want me to leave?
- Yes.

768
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,040
I want this door open right now.

769
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:21,000
- How about getting on the phone?
- Is there a technician?

770
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:57,390
Hey, Scooter! Wait up.

771
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,810
Come on, hurry it up. I'm late.

772
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:02,980
OK. I'll be right with you.

773
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:06,570
- I think it's jammed from inside.
- Come on.

774
01:09:06,690 --> 01:09:11,230
David! Come on, David.
You're just making it harder on yourself.

775
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:15,990
OK.

776
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:18,160
Let's go.

777
01:09:26,290 --> 01:09:28,790
Right this way, folks. I've been informed

778
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:32,410
that they're cleaning the floors
in the computer centre.

779
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:36,620
Don't want anyone to slip and hurt
themselves, so we'll end the tour here.

780
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:40,210
If I can ask you to board the bus
as quickly as possible,

781
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:44,500
you'll have a complimentary beverage
waiting for each of you.

782
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:46,550
Hold it! What are you doing?

783
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:48,840
Got it. Here it comes.

784
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:55,220
- You kids think you own this place?
- Oh! I was... just looking around.

785
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:59,470
You're not supposed to leave the group.
So get back there!

786
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:02,310
OK. Excuse me.
Thank you very much, sir.

787
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:05,270
Out of the way.

788
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:08,930
Thank you. Careful there.

789
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,350
Take care. Watch your step.

790
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,390
- Bye.
- Bye now.

791
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,060
Watch your step.

792
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:18,730
- Check everywhere. He can't be far.
- Move it, will you?

793
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,060
- Thanks.
- Take care.

794
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:18,220
Bye.

795
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:55,610
- What city, please?
- Goose lsland, Oregon, please.

796
01:12:55,740 --> 01:13:00,450
The number for Dr Robert Hume,
H-U-M-E, on Tall Cedar Road.

797
01:13:02,490 --> 01:13:06,450
Checking underDrRobert Hume,
H-U-M-E, on Tall CedarRoad,

798
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:08,410
I fiind no listing.

799
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:11,200
What does that mean?
He doesn't have a phone?

800
01:13:11,330 --> 01:13:13,370
I'm sorry. I have no listing.

801
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:15,540
Oh, wait.

802
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:21,040
Falken. Dr Stephen Falken,
F-A-L-K-E-N, at the same address.

803
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:25,960
I fiind no listing
for a Dr Stephen Falken, F-A-L-K-E-N,

804
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:28,380
on Tall CedarRoad, Goose lsland.

805
01:13:28,510 --> 01:13:30,470
Thank you.

806
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:47,890
Yeah?

807
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:49,770
Jennifer? It's me. David.

808
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:51,600
- David?
- Yeah.

809
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:54,100
Listen, I'm in Colorado

810
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:56,520
and I need a really big favour.

811
01:13:56,650 --> 01:13:59,020
- Can you lend me some money?
- What?

812
01:13:59,150 --> 01:14:02,070
I need an airline ticket.
I'll pay you back when I can.

813
01:14:02,190 --> 01:14:05,240
I need a ticket from Grand Junction,
Colorado to Oregon.

814
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,450
- Why? What's going on?
- I'll tell you all about it later.

815
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:10,820
David, what are you doing in Colorado?

816
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:13,950
I went by yourhouse.
Your parents werejust freaked.

817
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:17,280
There are men around from the FBI
asking questions.

818
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:19,450
I can't talk about it right now.

819
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:25,080
When you buy the ticket, tell them that
I'll pick it up in Grand Junction Airport.

820
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:27,210
David, what's happening?

821
01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:31,670
I can't talk. I've gotta get off the phone.
Please, will you just do this for me?

822
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:39,000
Punch up number five.
Let me see what you have.

823
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:44,130
22 Typhoon-class submarines
departing Petropavlovsk,

824
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:47,720
turning southbound at Nordkapp,
bearing 095 degrees.

825
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:50,050
Sergeant, I hope you like vodka.

826
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:54,720
Yes, sir. I just hope they don't make me
eat none of them damn fish eggs.

827
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:01,640
Give me an update...

828
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:05,600
Sir, the Soviets deny any increase
in their submarine deployment.

829
01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:08,020
They wanna know
why we're provoking them.

830
01:15:08,150 --> 01:15:11,110
They're full of shit.
We know they're down there.

831
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:13,860
I'm gonna blow their ass out of the water.

832
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,510
Surprise!

833
01:15:57,590 --> 01:16:01,720
- What are you doing here?
- You didn't sound too good on the phone.

834
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,930
- You shouldn't have come. I'm in trouble.
- Why?

835
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:08,550
Is this because of
what you did with my grade?

836
01:16:15,690 --> 01:16:18,600
You kids better hustle.
The ferry leaves any second.

837
01:16:18,730 --> 01:16:20,770
Thanks. Come on. We gotta run.

838
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,610
- Wait, wait, wait, wait! Whoa!
- Hold it, hold it!

839
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:41,370
If he's still alive,
why would the obituary say he's dead?

840
01:16:41,490 --> 01:16:43,530
No, he's not dead. He left.

841
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:47,120
When they know too much,
they give 'em new identities.

842
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:50,330
- Anyway, the computer said so.
- Oh, the computer said so.

843
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:54,790
The computer that's still playing
the games? It's the military's computer!

844
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:58,540
- Why wouldn't they know about it?
- They don't know about Joshua.

845
01:16:58,670 --> 01:17:02,460
Falken knows about Joshua. He's
the only one who knows what it can do.

846
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:06,510
That computer is trying to win the game
that we asked it to play.

847
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:08,670
For real!

848
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,920
You don't even believe me!

849
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:18,260
David... David.

850
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:22,010
- He's not dead.
- I'm sorry.

851
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,640
I believe you.

852
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,750
Oh!

853
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,300
What was that?

854
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:20,130
I don't know.

855
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:29,600
Did you see that? There are still people
who won't believe they could fly.

856
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,840
The sky was once filled with them.

857
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:35,760
- I'm looking for Dr Robert Hume.
- Is either of you a palaeontologist?

858
01:18:35,890 --> 01:18:37,930
No. We're high-school students.

859
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:40,100
Oh... Pity.

860
01:18:40,770 --> 01:18:43,060
Well, high-school students,

861
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:45,940
you're on my land and I didn't invite you.

862
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:47,060
But

863
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:49,520
aren't you Stephen Falken?

864
01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:52,610
Now, listen carefully.

865
01:18:53,190 --> 01:18:55,230
Path. Follow path.

866
01:18:56,150 --> 01:18:59,190
Gate. Open gate, through gate, close gate.

867
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:01,860
Last ferry 6.30, so run, run, run.

868
01:19:01,990 --> 01:19:04,320
Wait! Wait.

869
01:19:04,450 --> 01:19:06,490
I came because of Joshua.

870
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:52,890
Radar reports two unknown tracks are
penetrating the Alaskan air defence zone.

871
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:58,350
Confidence is high. Flight profile
suggests Soviet backfire bombers.

872
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:03,020
I want a visual confirmation on that.
Scramble two F-16s out of Galena.

873
01:20:05,230 --> 01:20:06,730
Go to DEFCON 2.

874
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:44,340
Crystal Palace, this is Delta Foxtrot 27.
I have negative radar contact.

875
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:46,670
Repeat, negative Soviet aircraft.

876
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,880
27, this is Brass Hat.
They're right in front of you!

877
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:52,050
You're almost on top of 'em.

878
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,760
Brass Hat, we got nothing on radar

879
01:20:54,890 --> 01:20:56,970
and 40 miles visibility.

880
01:20:57,090 --> 01:21:00,850
There's nothin' out there, General.
Just blue skies.

881
01:21:00,970 --> 01:21:03,010
What the hell?!

882
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:16,440
- You haven't been listening.
- Yes, I have.

883
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:19,030
I loved it when you nuked Las Vegas.

884
01:21:19,150 --> 01:21:22,570
A suitably biblical ending for the place,
don't you think?

885
01:21:22,690 --> 01:21:25,320
Are you gonna tell them
what Joshua's doing?

886
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:31,740
Now, children, come on over here.
I'm going to tell you a bedtime story.

887
01:21:31,870 --> 01:21:34,160
Are you sitting comfortably?

888
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:36,200
Then I'll begin.

889
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:42,410
Once upon a time, there lived
a magnificent race of animals

890
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:45,660
who dominated the world
through age after age.

891
01:21:45,790 --> 01:21:47,620
They ran and they swam

892
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:50,040
and they fought and they flew.

893
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:54,210
Until suddenly,
quite recently, they disappeared.

894
01:21:55,130 --> 01:21:58,710
Nature just gave up and started again.

895
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:01,460
We weren't even apes then.

896
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:05,630
We were just these smart little rodents
hiding in the rocks.

897
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:09,510
And when we go, nature will start again.

898
01:22:10,390 --> 01:22:12,430
With the bees probably.

899
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:15,890
Nature knows when to give up, David.

900
01:22:16,010 --> 01:22:18,060
I'm not giving up.

901
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:22,020
If Joshua tricks them
into launching an attack, it'll be your fault.

902
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:26,980
My fault? The whole point was
to find a way to practise nuclear war

903
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:29,150
without destroying ourselves.

904
01:22:29,270 --> 01:22:33,150
To get the computers to learn from
mistakes we couldn't afford to make.

905
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:36,740
Except I never could get Joshua
to learn the most important lesson.

906
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:38,320
What's that?

907
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:42,820
Futility. That there's a time
when you should just give up.

908
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:44,990
What kind of a lesson is that?

909
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,620
Did you ever play tic-tac-toe?

910
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:50,280
Yeah. Of course.

911
01:22:50,410 --> 01:22:52,450
- But you don't any more?
- No.

912
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:53,740
Why?

913
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:57,620
Because it's a boring game.
It's always a tie.

914
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:59,870
Exactly. There's no way to win.

915
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,580
The game itself is pointless.

916
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:07,250
But back at the war room,
they believe you can win a nuclear war.

917
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:11,050
That there can be acceptable losses.

918
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:15,380
So you gave up? Decided to play dead?

919
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:20,260
For security reasons,
they graciously arranged my death.

920
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,100
Did you know that no land animal

921
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:27,720
with a body weight of over 50lb
survived that age?

922
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:31,770
Extinction is part of the natural order.

923
01:23:31,890 --> 01:23:33,310
Bullshit!

924
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:38,150
If we're extinguished, it's not natural.
It's just stupid!

925
01:23:38,270 --> 01:23:40,730
Oh, it's all right. I've planned ahead.

926
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:44,310
We're just three miles
from a primary target.

927
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:47,480
A millisecond of brilliant light

928
01:23:47,610 --> 01:23:49,360
and we're vaporised.

929
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:53,780
Much more fortunate than the millions
who'll wander sightless

930
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:56,400
through the smouldering aftermath.

931
01:23:57,660 --> 01:24:00,240
We'll be spared the horror of survival.

932
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:03,370
I'm only 17 years old.

933
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,410
I'm not ready to die yet.

934
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:08,750
You won't make a simple phone call?

935
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:14,330
If the real Joshua was still alive,
your Joshua,

936
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:17,750
- you'd do it, wouldn't you?
- Look, we might gain a few years.

937
01:24:17,870 --> 01:24:21,290
Perhaps time enough for you
to have a son and watch him die.

938
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:25,800
But humanity
planning its own destruction...

939
01:24:26,710 --> 01:24:28,760
That a phone call won't stop.

940
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:33,760
This is unreal! You don't care about death
cos you're already dead.

941
01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:38,890
I know a lot about you.
I know you weren't always like this.

942
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:41,390
What was the last thing you cared about?

943
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:48,350
You've missed the last ferry.

944
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:59,440
You're welcome to stay.
You want to sleep on the floor?

945
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:06,070
Good night.

946
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:09,910
Let's get outta here.

947
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:23,330
Come on. We'll find a boat.
There's gotta be a boat.

948
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:44,800
Mr President, we've got 48 nuclear subs
closing on the United States.

949
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:48,430
And we've got 100,000 Soviet troops
massing in East Germany.

950
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:51,720
We're monitoring their bombers
that are on alert. Yes, sir...

951
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:53,890
Well, that's a load of shit!

952
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:55,600
No, sir. Not you.

953
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:59,730
Yes, sir. We'll be in touch
as soon as the information changes.

954
01:25:59,850 --> 01:26:04,150
Intelligence reports rumours of a new
Soviet bomber with Stealth capabilities.

955
01:26:04,270 --> 01:26:08,060
It can project a false radar image
600 miles away from the real aircraft.

956
01:26:08,190 --> 01:26:10,650
Christ! Now they got us chasing shadows.

957
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:24,990
I think I saw one.

958
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:34,240
What kind of an asshole lives on an island
and he doesn't even have a boat?

959
01:26:34,370 --> 01:26:37,500
Maybe we can swim for it.
How far do you think it is?

960
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:39,830
No. It's two or three miles.

961
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:42,000
At least. Maybe more.

962
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:44,880
- Well, what do you say? Let's go for it.
- No.

963
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,630
- Come on.
- No!

964
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:48,130
I can't swim.

965
01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:50,840
You can't swim?

966
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:53,010
No. OK, Wonder Woman? I can't swim.

967
01:26:53,130 --> 01:26:57,170
What kind of an asshole grows up
in Seattle and doesn't know how to swim?

968
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:59,470
I never got around to it, OK?

969
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:02,800
I always thought
there was gonna be plenty of time!

970
01:27:02,930 --> 01:27:05,100
I'm sorry.

971
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,850
I wish I didn't know about any of this.

972
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:16,140
I wish I was like
everybody else in the world.

973
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:19,230
Then tomorrow it would just be over.

974
01:27:22,190 --> 01:27:24,650
There wouldn't be any time to be sorry.

975
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:28,190
About anything.

976
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:36,700
Oh, Jesus!

977
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:40,200
I really wanted to learn how to swim.

978
01:27:41,370 --> 01:27:43,410
I swear to God I did.

979
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:54,790
Did I tell you that next week

980
01:27:55,790 --> 01:27:57,840
I was gonna be on TV?

981
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:00,290
You're kidding?

982
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:03,670
On that aerobics show
with some girls from my dad's class.

983
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:05,750
A movie star.

984
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:07,880
Yeah!

985
01:28:08,010 --> 01:28:12,590
It's kinda stupid, huh? I mean, nobody
would have been watching me anyway.

986
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:13,930
I would have.

987
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:34,940
Oh, Jesus!

988
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:37,110
The bastard turned us in!

989
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,520
It's all right. Get in.

990
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:10,910
We have a launch detection.
We have a Soviet launch detection.

991
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:13,080
BMEWS has confiirmed a massive attack.

992
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:16,290
- Missile warning. No malfunction.
- Confiidence is high.

993
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:19,620
- Cobra Dane, is this an exercise?
- This is not an exercise.

994
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:23,460
General, DPS is tracking
300 inbound Soviet ICBMs.

995
01:30:30,130 --> 01:30:33,380
- Tell me this is one of your simulations.
- It's not, Jack.

996
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:37,220
All right. Flush the bombers.
Get the subs in launch mode.

997
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:40,300
We are at DEFCON 1 .

998
01:30:40,430 --> 01:30:41,470
DEFCON 1.

999
01:30:44,930 --> 01:30:48,720
Major Lem, get me a report on the WOPR.

1000
01:30:50,850 --> 01:30:54,390
Initial attack profile
is a full-scale Soviet strike.

1001
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:58,520
WOPR is putting our losses
at 85 to 95% of the strategic forces.

1002
01:30:58,650 --> 01:31:01,060
What does WOPR recommend,
Mr McKittrick?

1003
01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:03,650
Full-scale retaliatory strike.

1004
01:31:05,230 --> 01:31:07,530
I need some machine to tell me that?

1005
01:31:07,650 --> 01:31:10,820
President's on his way
to join Airborne Command.

1006
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:12,700
We have to give launch option.

1007
01:31:12,820 --> 01:31:16,530
- Has he spoken to the premier?
- The Russians deny everything.

1008
01:31:16,660 --> 01:31:19,160
We have a Soviet submarine
launch detection.

1009
01:31:19,820 --> 01:31:23,160
Let's go into a launch mode.
Close up the mountain.

1010
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:33,580
This is Crystal Palace.
We're closing up the mountain.

1011
01:31:33,710 --> 01:31:36,830
After the gates are closed,
nobody gets in or out.

1012
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:45,630
Initiate internal power.

1013
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:48,840
Generators on and functioning.

1014
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:59,720
External power disconnected.

1015
01:32:03,350 --> 01:32:05,390
Seal off ventilation shafts.

1016
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,350
Shaft locks sealed.

1017
01:32:12,110 --> 01:32:14,230
The gate's closed!

1018
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:23,780
Is everybody OK?

1019
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:26,490
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Run for it!

1020
01:32:29,870 --> 01:32:31,910
The gate's gonna shut! Come on!

1021
01:32:32,030 --> 01:32:34,080
Come on!

1022
01:32:46,290 --> 01:32:48,330
Hold the door! Hold the door!

1023
01:32:52,170 --> 01:32:54,500
Hold the goddamn door!

1024
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:01,380
Come on! Hurry!

1025
01:33:04,050 --> 01:33:06,050
They're clear! They're clear!

1026
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:28,940
All units confirm weapons targeted
and ready. Awaiting launch codes.

1027
01:33:29,060 --> 01:33:31,110
We are in a launch mode.

1028
01:33:31,230 --> 01:33:33,570
Major Lem, lock out changes.

1029
01:33:33,690 --> 01:33:35,740
Roger. Lock out enabled.

1030
01:33:45,740 --> 01:33:47,740
All right. I'll call you back.

1031
01:33:47,870 --> 01:33:50,330
Here!

1032
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:00,250
I don't know what you think
you can do here, Stephen.

1033
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:04,080
John! Good to see you!
I see the wife still picks your ties.

1034
01:34:04,210 --> 01:34:07,540
- What has this kid been telling you?
- How far has it gone?

1035
01:34:07,670 --> 01:34:13,050
The president's ready for a counterstrike.
That's what we're recommending he do.

1036
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:18,510
- It's a bluff, John. Call it off.
- No, it's not a bluff. It's real.

1037
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:21,390
Hello, General Beringer? Stephen Falken.

1038
01:34:22,010 --> 01:34:25,010
Mr Falken, you picked
a hell of a day for a visit.

1039
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:29,470
General, what you see
on these screens up here is a fantasy.

1040
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,470
A computer-enhanced hallucination.

1041
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:35,850
Those blips are not real missiles.
They're phantoms.

1042
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:40,190
There's nothing to indicate a simulation.
Everything's working perfectly.

1043
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:43,110
- Does it make any sense?
- Does what make any sense?

1044
01:34:43,230 --> 01:34:44,150
That!

1045
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:47,860
Look, I don't have time
for a conversation right now.

1046
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:51,450
General, are you prepared
to destroy the enemy?

1047
01:34:51,570 --> 01:34:52,570
You betcha!

1048
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:56,740
- Do you think they know that?
- I believe we've made that clear enough.

1049
01:34:56,870 --> 01:34:58,700
Then... don't.

1050
01:34:58,820 --> 01:35:01,870
Tell the president to ride out the attack.

1051
01:35:01,990 --> 01:35:04,240
Sir, they need a decision.

1052
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:08,700
General, do you really believe
that the enemy would attack

1053
01:35:08,830 --> 01:35:12,160
without provocation,
using so many missiles and subs,

1054
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:15,710
so that we would have no choice
but to totally annihilate them?

1055
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:18,170
One minute and 30 seconds to impact.

1056
01:35:18,290 --> 01:35:21,050
General, you are listening to a machine.

1057
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:24,510
Do the world a favour
and don't act like one.

1058
01:35:29,380 --> 01:35:31,890
One minute and 20 seconds to impact.

1059
01:35:43,730 --> 01:35:45,060
Yes, Mr President.

1060
01:35:45,190 --> 01:35:49,400
Sir, at this point in time, we cannot
positively confirm the inbounds.

1061
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:52,310
We have reason to believe
they may not exist.

1062
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:54,810
Yes, sir. That's affirmative.

1063
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:57,440
Yes, sir.

1064
01:35:57,570 --> 01:35:58,860
I do, too.

1065
01:35:58,980 --> 01:36:01,030
One minute to impact.

1066
01:36:01,860 --> 01:36:03,900
Who's first and how soon?

1067
01:36:04,030 --> 01:36:07,030
Initial impact
in the 43rd Bomb Wing at Loring,

1068
01:36:07,150 --> 01:36:10,280
319th at Grand Forks,
and Alaskan Air Command, Elmendorf.

1069
01:36:10,410 --> 01:36:12,450
50 seconds to impact.

1070
01:36:12,570 --> 01:36:15,660
Get me the senior controllers.
I wanna talk to 'em myself.

1071
01:36:15,790 --> 01:36:17,910
All stations, this is Crystal Palace.

1072
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:20,870
Stand by for a message from Brass Hat.
Acknowledge.

1073
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,670
ElmendorfAirForce Base Operations.
Lieutenant Colonel Bowers.

1074
01:36:24,790 --> 01:36:27,960
319th Bomb Wing Operations.
Colonel Chase.

1075
01:36:28,090 --> 01:36:33,340
Colonel, this is Loring AirForce Base.
The senior controllerisn't here right now.

1076
01:36:33,460 --> 01:36:35,500
That's all right. Who are you?

1077
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:38,300
Sir, this is Airman Dougherty, sir.

1078
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:41,840
This is General Beringer at NORAD.

1079
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:44,010
Our current situation...

1080
01:36:45,090 --> 01:36:48,300
Men, we're currently tracking

1081
01:36:48,430 --> 01:36:51,600
approximately 2,400 inbound
Soviet warheads.

1082
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:54,310
But at the moment
we cannot confirm this.

1083
01:36:54,430 --> 01:36:57,060
I repeat, we cannot confirm this.

1084
01:36:57,180 --> 01:36:59,060
30 seconds to impact.

1085
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:03,850
We're right there with you guys.
We've taken all the steps we can.

1086
01:37:04,690 --> 01:37:07,320
Stand by to launch missiles
at my command.

1087
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:17,360
Stay on this channel as long as you can.

1088
01:37:17,490 --> 01:37:19,530
We'll be standing by.

1089
01:37:19,650 --> 01:37:21,700
20 seconds to impact.

1090
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:34,160
Ten... nine...

1091
01:37:34,290 --> 01:37:37,160
eight... seven...

1092
01:37:37,290 --> 01:37:38,710
six...

1093
01:37:38,830 --> 01:37:40,580
five...

1094
01:37:40,710 --> 01:37:41,750
four...

1095
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:43,210
three...

1096
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:44,580
two...

1097
01:37:44,710 --> 01:37:46,800
one... Impact.

1098
01:38:04,050 --> 01:38:06,260
This is Crystal Palace. Are you still on?

1099
01:38:08,270 --> 01:38:12,640
This is Crystal Palace.
Are you still on? Anyone there?

1100
01:38:13,390 --> 01:38:15,440
That's affiirmative, sir.

1101
01:38:16,690 --> 01:38:18,020
Yeah! We're here!

1102
01:38:18,150 --> 01:38:21,770
- Jesus H Christ! We're still here!
- Our boards are showing impact.

1103
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:26,940
No, sir. No impact. We're alive and well.

1104
01:38:27,070 --> 01:38:28,480
All right!

1105
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:30,490
All right!

1106
01:38:35,740 --> 01:38:37,780
All right!

1107
01:38:44,290 --> 01:38:46,580
All right! Recall the bombers!

1108
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:48,830
Stand down the missiles!

1109
01:39:20,430 --> 01:39:22,890
Joshua, what are you doing?

1110
01:39:26,190 --> 01:39:28,560
COC, I need Dr McKittrick right away.

1111
01:39:29,230 --> 01:39:31,770
- This is McKittrick.
- Sir, we got a problem.

1112
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:34,110
WOPR's not letting me log back on.

1113
01:39:34,230 --> 01:39:37,610
- I can't get in to stand down the missiles.
- Stand by.

1114
01:39:50,490 --> 01:39:52,120
Paul, this is McKittrick.

1115
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:54,490
The WOPR's not letting us back in.

1116
01:39:54,620 --> 01:39:58,160
I know. No one can get back on.
We're trying everything.

1117
01:39:58,290 --> 01:40:01,750
It's like the entire password file
has been wiped out.

1118
01:40:01,870 --> 01:40:04,750
I tried that! Don't you think
I would have tried that?

1119
01:40:08,090 --> 01:40:09,920
What are those?

1120
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:12,090
Those are launch codes.

1121
01:40:12,210 --> 01:40:14,250
What are they for?

1122
01:40:14,380 --> 01:40:18,630
Joshua's trying to find the right codes
so he can launch the missiles himself.

1123
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:30,180
What's happening?

1124
01:40:30,310 --> 01:40:32,810
The random number generators
aren't running.

1125
01:40:32,930 --> 01:40:34,970
- Got anything?
- I'm still looking.

1126
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:37,720
I got no idea.
It could be coming from anywhere.

1127
01:40:39,770 --> 01:40:41,980
Sir, you better get on the headset.

1128
01:40:44,020 --> 01:40:45,060
Yeah?

1129
01:40:45,190 --> 01:40:50,230
General, the machine has locked us out.
It's sending random numbers to the silos.

1130
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:52,400
Codes. To launch the missiles.

1131
01:40:52,530 --> 01:40:54,570
Just unplug the goddamn thing!

1132
01:40:54,690 --> 01:40:57,950
- Jesus Christ!
- That won't work, General.

1133
01:40:58,070 --> 01:41:01,410
It would interpret a shutdown
as the destruction of NORAD.

1134
01:41:01,530 --> 01:41:06,370
The computers in the silos would carry
out their last instructions. They'd launch.

1135
01:41:06,490 --> 01:41:09,910
- Can't we disarm the missiles?
- Over a thousand of them?

1136
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:14,080
There's no time. At this rate
it'll hit the launch codes in 5.3 minutes.

1137
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:20,000
Mr McKittrick?
After very careful consideration, sir,

1138
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:24,460
I have come to the conclusion
that your new defence system sucks.

1139
01:41:25,420 --> 01:41:28,340
I don't have to take that,
you pig-eyed sack of shit.

1140
01:41:28,460 --> 01:41:33,380
I was hoping for something a little better
than that from a man of your education.

1141
01:41:33,510 --> 01:41:35,550
General, it's the president.

1142
01:41:40,510 --> 01:41:43,470
What do you...
What are you gonna tell him?

1143
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:47,810
That I'm ordering our bombers
back to fail-safe.

1144
01:41:47,930 --> 01:41:51,020
We might have to go through
this thing after all.

1145
01:41:53,730 --> 01:41:54,730
Yes, sir.

1146
01:42:01,820 --> 01:42:05,360
He's got one. When he gets all ten,
he'll launch the missiles.

1147
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:08,860
- Well, can't they get in and stop it?
- No. They can't.

1148
01:42:11,490 --> 01:42:14,410
They've taken out my password.

1149
01:42:14,530 --> 01:42:17,450
- Well, what are we gonna do?
- I don't know. Do you?

1150
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:20,950
I told you not to start
playing games with that thing.

1151
01:42:24,910 --> 01:42:26,160
It's games.

1152
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:30,330
- Games!
- Try it.

1153
01:42:30,460 --> 01:42:34,080
- John, feed it a tapeworm.
- Too risky. It might smash the system.

1154
01:42:34,210 --> 01:42:36,880
- Did the kid get in the back door?
- We took it out.

1155
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,380
- Invade the deep logic.
- We hit a fire wall.

1156
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:42,630
If it wants to play a game, then play it.
Have it list games.

1157
01:42:42,750 --> 01:42:45,670
- For Christ's sake!
- He's played before.

1158
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:48,170
- He can hardly do worse.
- Two numbers.

1159
01:42:48,300 --> 01:42:51,180
I'd piss on a spark plug
if I thought it'd do any good.

1160
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:53,970
- Let the boy in there, Major.
- List games.

1161
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:01,640
Chess.

1162
01:43:08,890 --> 01:43:10,480
Three numbers locked in.

1163
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:11,940
Poker.

1164
01:43:14,610 --> 01:43:18,110
Security system's
not gonna let anything through.

1165
01:43:20,530 --> 01:43:22,570
Global thermonuclear war.

1166
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:32,780
Four numbers.

1167
01:43:35,290 --> 01:43:37,660
Stephen, for Christ's sake. Do something.

1168
01:43:37,790 --> 01:43:40,210
- Come on, kid. Let's go.
- No. Try again.

1169
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:45,500
- Put the list back up.
- We already tried that.

1170
01:43:45,630 --> 01:43:47,420
- Put it up!
- Yes, put it up.

1171
01:43:55,420 --> 01:43:58,340
- It's not on the list!
- What's not on the list?

1172
01:43:58,470 --> 01:44:00,380
Go ahead. It's got to be somewhere.

1173
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:06,510
Tic-tac-toe.

1174
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:15,350
You're in. Order it to disarm the missiles.

1175
01:44:15,470 --> 01:44:16,680
No! No.

1176
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:28,820
Five numbers. It's got half the code.

1177
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:32,190
One.

1178
01:44:33,730 --> 01:44:35,740
- Put X in the centre square.
- I know.

1179
01:44:46,830 --> 01:44:49,120
- Six up.
- There's no way you can win.

1180
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:52,330
I know that. It doesn't. It hasn't learned.

1181
01:44:52,450 --> 01:44:57,080
- Is there any way to make it play itself?
- Yes. Number of players zero.

1182
01:45:18,010 --> 01:45:19,430
Seven!

1183
01:45:19,550 --> 01:45:22,140
Come on. Learn, goddamn it.

1184
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:36,140
Eight.

1185
01:45:36,270 --> 01:45:40,770
It must be caught in a loop. It's taking
power from the rest of the system.

1186
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:43,690
Nine numbers.

1187
01:45:47,570 --> 01:45:50,650
Ten! It's got the code. It's going to launch.

1188
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:11,960
Colonel Conley, call SAC.
Get me a launch status report.

1189
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:16,500
Major Davis, get me the president.

1190
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:50,980
How you doin', Colonel?

1191
01:46:51,110 --> 01:46:54,610
Land lines out of the mountain are dead.
I'm trying satellites.

1192
01:47:19,910 --> 01:47:22,830
- What's it doing?
- It's learning.

1193
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:12,900
Greetings, ProfessorFalken.

1194
01:48:21,870 --> 01:48:24,490
Hello, Joshua.

1195
01:48:25,330 --> 01:48:27,200
Strange game.

1196
01:48:27,330 --> 01:48:30,620
The only winning move is not to play.

1197
01:48:38,620 --> 01:48:41,920
How about a nice game of chess?

1198
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:22,110
Colonel Conley, take us to DEFCON 5.

1199
01:49:22,230 --> 01:49:24,280
Yes, sir.
