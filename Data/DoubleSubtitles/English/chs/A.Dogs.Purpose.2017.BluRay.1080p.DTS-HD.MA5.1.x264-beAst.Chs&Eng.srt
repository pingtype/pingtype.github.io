16

我做过什么事情吗

00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,410
快把那个吐出来
Get that out of your mouth.

147
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,650
好了 来这边
Okay. Come here.

148
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,710
握个手 握个手
Shake your paw. Shake your paw.

149
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,590
来吧 好孩子
Come on. Yeah, good boy!

150
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,960
转个身 转个身
Turn around. Turn around.

151
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,720
- 来吧  - 他在说些什么
- Come on.  - What's he saying?

152
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,430
- 字数太多了  - 来吧 来吧
- It's too many words.  - Come on. Okay.

153
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,090
- 我还是干这个吧  - 过来
- I'm gonna do this now.  - Come here.

154
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:28,920
干得好 干得好
Good job. Good job.

155
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,190
但相比之下 有个词重复了很多次
But one word got said more than any other.

156
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,130
贝利 贝利 贝利 贝利 贝利
Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.

157
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,070
过了一会儿
After a while,

158
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,570
我开始明白这个词的重要性
I came to understand the words that mattered.

159
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,350
我养了个男孩 他叫伊森
I had a boy, and his name was Ethan.

160
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,770
我也有名字
I got a name.

161
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,500
我叫贝利 贝利 贝利 贝利 贝利
My name was Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.

162
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,330
亲爱的 真希望知道你和韦斯之间…
Oh, gee, honey, I wish I'd have known that you and Wes were...

163
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,780
我知道了自己在家的地位
I learned my place in the pack.

164
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,630
妈妈喜欢我
Mom liked me.

165
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,700
爸爸喜欢我
Dad liked me.

166
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,890
- 是的 是的我知道  - 超级喜欢
- Yes. Yes, no, I understand.  - A lot.

167
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,890
不好意思 稍等一下
Oh, excuse me. Hold on. Come on.

168
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,410
一边儿去
Get down a bit.

169
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,870
真替猫感到悲哀
I was sad for the cat.

170
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,110
很明显他也想当一只狗
Obviously, he wanted to be a dog.

171
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,810
当不成又不是我的错
Wasn't my fault he couldn't be a dog.

172
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,010
伊森 该睡觉啦
Ethan, it's time to go to bed.

173
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,700
该关灯了好吗
Time to turn out the light, okay?

174
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,470
好的
Okay.

175
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,100
好了 来吧 来吧
Okay, come on. Come on.

176
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,800
来吧 来吧
Come on. Come on.

177
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,260
“别 别这么做 队长”
"Don't! Don't do it, cap.

178
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,510
“给他吧 巴基”
"Let him have it, bucky.

179
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,820
“我们得给他点颜色看看”
"We'll pound some sense into this character.

180
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,810
“砰 泰山压顶”
"Pow! Stomp!

181
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,180
“它冲着我们来了”
"It's coming right at us.

182
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,430
“快跳下去逃生”
Jump for your lives!"

183
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,410
伊森总能想出这样有趣的游戏
Ethan always came up with such great games.

184
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,790
躲在毯子下说话 真是个天才
Making noise under a blanket. Genius.

185
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,590
每晚睡着之后
Every night as I fell asleep,

186
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,920
我都会觉得养一只伊森真开心
I thought about how happy I was that I had an Ethan.

187
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,250
也庆幸自己不是猫
And that I wasn't a cat.

188
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,470
贝利 到车里来
Bailey, get in the car.

189
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,400
来吧 孩子
Come on, boy.

190
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,120
我们走
Come on!

191
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,900
当家人想让我出去透透气时
Whenever the family wanted me to get some fresh smells,

192
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,830
我们都会开车兜兜风
we all got in the car for a ride.

193
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,660
青草 绿树 蟾蜍 青苔 臭鼬
Grass, tree, toad, moss, skunk,

194
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,700
死臭鼬 池塘
dead skunk, pond,

195
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,450
泥土 山羊
mud, goat.

196
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,760
山羊
Goat!

197
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,880
人们每天都在思索同一个问题
Everyone was asking themself the same question

198
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,120
“为什么不是所有的东西都有山羊味”
"Why can't everything smell like goat?"

199
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,270
臭死了
Ooh, it stinks!

200
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,720
看看是谁来了
Oh, look who's here!

201
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,870
猜猜我们还带了谁
Guess what we got.

202
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,250
带了谁
What have you got?

203
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,900
你们带了谁
What'd you get?

204
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,040
下来吧 贝利
Come on, Bailey.

205
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,870
- 我的天 看看它  - 一只小狗狗
- Oh, my. Look at this.  - Oh! A puppy! -Oh, my gosh.

206
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,230
孩子 看这里
Here, boy. Here.

207
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,560
它要去哪儿
Where's he going?

208
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,780
我常常觉得
Sometimes I thought

209
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,130
生活中东想西想很浪费时间
that trying to make sense out of life could be a waste of time.

210
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,870
直接享受生活 顺其自然
Maybe it was better to just really enjoy life

211
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,490
会不会更好呢
and leave it at that.

212
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,140
咦 大家去哪里了
Hey, where'd everybody go?

213
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,150
小鸡们呢
Where's all the chickens?

214
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,520
贝利 贝利 贝利
Bailey! Bailey, Bailey!

215
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,370
伊森 伊森 伊森 伊森 伊森
Ethan, Ethan, Ethan, Ethan, Ethan!

216
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,780
老天爷 看看谁来啦
Oh, my goodness! Look who's here!

217
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,660
不知道为什么
For some reason,

218
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,520
他们不愿意和我一起玩这个球
they wouldn't share this ball with me.

219
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,140
跑吧 伊森 快跑
Yes! Run, Ethan, run!

220
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,850
众所周知
Everybody knows

221
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,450
在球类运动历史上
there's never been a game in the history of balls

222
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,830
还没有过狗狗参赛的先例
that can't be improved by having a dog in it.

223
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,430
但这个球长得有点奇怪
But there was something weird about this ball.

224
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,810
宝藏
Treasure.

225
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,970
这才叫生活
Ah, this is the life.

226
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,940
谁还要吗 吉姆 你的咖啡
Anyone else? Jim, your coffee?

227
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,980
- 谢谢  - 给你
- Oh, thank you.  - Here you go.

228
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,480
大家都到齐了
Here we all are.

229
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,310
对呀 好好吃吧
Yeah. Enjoy your meal.

230
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,820
我喜欢老年人
I liked the old humans.

231
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,070
他们懂我
They got me.

232
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,230
可以不要喂狗吃东西了吗
Would you please stop feeding the dog?

233
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,950
我们在试着训练它
We're trying to train him.

234
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,110
我告诉过你了
I told you.

235
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,020
被抓现行了 不好意思
You caught me. I'm sorry.

236
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,140
可以把果酱递给我吗
Could you pass me the jam, please?

237
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,370
当我注意力不在吃上时 我就会乱想
When I wasn't thinking about food, my mind wandered.

238
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,090
我为什么会在这里
Why am I here?

239
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,460
有什么目的吗
What's the purpose?

240
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,380
真爽 接着揉
Oh, yeah. Keep rubbing.

241
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,580
会有更多的培根吗
And... Might there be more bacon?

242
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,870
看他的盘子里
Oh, look at his plate.

243
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,110
要知道 照这么吃下去
You know, the way you eat,

244
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,210
等你长大了之后 我们几个加起来
you're gonna grow up to be bigger

245
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,760
都不够你的块头大
than all of us put together.

246
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,990
前提是得有个和平年代
If there's a world to grow up in.

247
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,230
俄国人在古巴布置了导弹
These Russians are putting missiles in Cuba.

248
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,550
我们非得现在说这个吗
Do we have to talk about that now?

249
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,600
- 没有啊  - 对了 吉姆
- No.  - So, um, Jim,

250
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,530
听说你换了份办公室工作
I hear you're up for a new office job.

251
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,720
不如跟我们讲讲这个吧
Why don't you tell us about that?

252
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,220
并没有谈成
That didn't work out.

253
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,770
他们想让他出外勤
Well, they want him in the field.

254
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,760
顶级销售员年年都有他名字
He's one of the top sellers every year.

255
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,860
我干的活是个烫手山芋
I got the job nobody wants.

256
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,440
吉姆 你非要这样吗
Jim, do you have to?

257
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,420
核打击已经近在咫尺了
We're three seconds away from nuclear annihilation.

258
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,630
我和贝利能离桌了吗
Uh, can me and Bailey be excused?

259
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:22,990
当然
Sure.

260
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,900
伊森很难过
Ethan was sad.

261
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,850
我不知道为什么
I didn't know why.

262
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,630
嗨 贝利
Hey, Bailey.

263
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,580
还记得美国队长吗
Captain America, remember?

264
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,110
他可以一瞬间就拆掉炸弹
He could take out that bomb in a second.

265
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,620
啪
Pow!

266
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,660
咻
Zap!

267
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,470
看来你挺喜欢呀
Oh, you like it, don't you?

268
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,470
来呀 来呀
Come on. Come on.

269
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,350
就是这样
Yeah, boy.

270
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,870
贝利 准备好了
Okay, Bailey.

271
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,310
去捡回来
Get it, boy!

272
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,230
加油呀
Come on!

273
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,590
就是这样伙计
Yeah, boy! Come on.

274
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,200
来 去哪儿了
Come on. Oh, where'd it go?

275
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,040
去哪儿了
Where'd it go?

276
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,550
在这呢 你看那是什么
Come on, boy! Oh! What is that?

277
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:27,860
把它捡回来
Get it, boy!

278
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,020
加油 加油 拿到它
Oh, come on. Come on, get it!

279
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,380
- 我们玩了一下午球  - 就是这样
- We played with that ball all afternoon.  - Yeah! Come on!

280
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,590
- 伊森特别喜欢这个游戏  - 干得漂亮
- Ethan loved it.  - Good boy!

281
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,010
捡回来
Get it!

282
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,830
加油 加油
Come on! Come on.

283
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,470
爸 瞧瞧这招
Hey, dad, watch this.

284
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,420
看看他的能耐
Look what he can do.

285
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,880
贝利 准备好了吗
Okay, Bailey. Ready?

286
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,990
准备好了

380
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,630
想看看外勤办公室

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,090
对你过去一年业绩的印象很深刻

我很高兴你提到这个
You know, I'm glad you brought that up.

389
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,800
我正好也想和你谈一下这件事
Uh, I've actually been meaning to talk to you about that.

390
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,160
我觉得既然业绩这么好
You know, I-I was thinking, with the numbers so high,

391
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,230
也许是时候让我不再出差
maybe it's time I get off the road

392
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,060
转而去坐办公室了
and take an office position.

393
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,050
我们需要你继续出差

你是整个业务的骨干精英
That's the backbone of the whole operation really.

395
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,410
吉姆 说实话

你是最优秀的旅行推销员

398
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,520

Well, Herman, i don't know anything about coins,

403
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,160
但我知道金鹰硬币是很特别的

是啊 我还从没亲眼见过呢
Yeah, I have never seen one up close before.

406
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,330
- 它可不是一般的硬币  - 是的 它还特别漂亮
- It's quite a coin.  - Yeah, it's a beauty.

407
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,330
我去拿给你看
I'll show you. I'll go get it.

408
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,900
吃完饭再去吧
Well, maybe after dinner.

409
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,080
那我一会去拿
Let me go get it later.

410
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,810
我可以去玩吗
May I please be excused?

411
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,030
什么
Huh?

412
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,750
我可以去玩吗
May I please be excused?

413
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,290
我想带贝利出去玩
Need to take Bailey out for a walk.

414
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,120
当然了 宝贝

419
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,250
快拉 快拉
Come on. Come on.

420
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,060

421
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,760

你怎么回事 快拉啊
What's your problem? Come on!

423
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,740
我不知道他为什么不开心 但这让我很着急
I don't know why he was so upset, but it made me anxious.

424
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,010
而我着急的时候 肠胃蠕动就非常快
And when I'm anxious, things kind of move super fast.

425
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,180
这还是第一次
This was a first.

426
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,200
从来没见过他这么高兴地清理我的粪便
I'd never seen him so happy to clean up after me.

427
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,540

I really don't like rats. I don't like rats.

448
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,510
比起你怕它们 是老鼠更怕你吧
It's more scared of you than you are of him.

449
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:36,630

我觉得老鼠已经跑了
I think it's gone now.

458
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,160
我好讨厌老鼠

459
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,840
贝利
Bailey!

460
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,380

461
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,260

你抓到他了吗 吉姆 抓到没
You got him, Jim? You got him?

465
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,900
升职什么的再也不用想了
Any chances I had of a promotion, forget it.

466
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,560
爸爸 别这样
Dad! Dad, stop!

467
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,660
- 这不是它的错  - 你让我们跟傻子一样
- It's not his fault. It's...  - You made us look like fools!

468
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,180
爸爸散发这个味道的时候说话总是很大声
Dad always talked so loud when he smelled this way.

469
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:16,720
别惩罚他 都是我的错
Don't punish him! My fault!

470
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,020
吉姆 你要不要先冷静一下
Jim, why don't we take a moment before you...

471
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,550
不必了 从现在起 狗待在这里
No, from now on, he stays out here.

472
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,260
它什么也没做
He didn't do anything!

473
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,780
我不想看到他
I do not want to see him.

474
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,420
别让我在屋子里再见到他
I do not want to see him in the house.

475
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,330
可是外面冷
But it's cold outside.

476
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,190
他有毛的
Well, he's got fur for that.

477
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,130
我们至少得给他铺个毯子吧
We should at least set out a blanket.

478
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,760
它只是条狗
It's a dog!

479
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,830
伊森
Ethan?

480
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,180
狗狗 你还好吗

I'm so sorry.

482
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,520
都是我的错
It's all my fault.

483
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,400
尽管我看不到他
Even though I couldn't see him,

484
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,210
我知道伊森那晚很难过
I knew Ethan was very sad that night.

485
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,610
乖狗狗
Hey, boy.

486
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,240
外面太冷了 是吧
It's cold out there, isn't it?

487
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,750
我知道他需要我
I knew he needed me.

488
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,890
我也需要他
And I needed him, too.

489
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,750
真是条乖狗狗
You're a good boy.

- 太棒了  - 好

501
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,950

502
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,000
打得好
Nice play.

503
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,710
伊森 传得漂亮
Great pass, Ethan.

504
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,140
真厉害 棒极了
Got 'em now. Right on.

505
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,180
你 你每次都把球传到他那个位置
You-you get it to him every time.

506
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,130
确实
Yeah, exactly.

507
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,310
因为每次我们用那种战术的时候
'Cause every time we run that play...

508
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:28,500
所有人都想走在老大旁边
Everybody wanted to walk next to the Alpha male.

509
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,540
是啊 我就是这个意思

几乎所有人
Almost everybody.

511
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,080
- 因为每次他都正好在那个位置  - 是的
- 'Cause he's right there every single time.  - Yep.

512
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,740
- 伊森 为什么你总是带着这条狗  - 什么
- Ethan, why do you always have this dog with you?  - Hmm?

513
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,640
是用来替代女朋友的还是干吗的
What? It's like a girlfriend replacement or something?

514
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,610
说得好 托德
Yeah, good one, Todd.

515
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,180
亲一个
Give a little kiss? Huh?

516
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,310
我只是问问
I'm just asking.

517
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,840
不好意思
Excuse me.

518

我很抱歉 托德
Oh, I'm sorry, Todd.

519
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,780
刚才 是不是我的替补女朋友绊倒了你
Did my, uh, girlfriend replacement just trip you?

520
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,110
很好笑
Very funny.

521
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,840
放轻松 伙计 我就是开个玩笑
Relax, man. I'm kidding.

522
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,690
那只狗都在笑你
The dog's laughing at you.

523
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:56,490
- 狗不会笑 你个白痴  - 贝利 过来
- Dogs don't laugh, you moron.  - Bailey, come here.

一开始卢传那脚球的时候
When Lou dropped that pass at the start,

527
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,020
- 我还以为我们死定了  - 我就知道
- I thought we were done, man.  - I know!

- I got a casserole in the oven.  - Yeah?

533

非洲是成千上万动物的家
Africa is home to hundreds of thousands of animals.

534
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,690
有些看起来很滑稽
Some look comical,

535
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,790
有些 有些让人望而生畏
some... Some forbidding,

536
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,260
还有些使人着迷到
and some so entrancing that we'd like

537
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,130
让人想伸开手 触碰它们
to reach out and touch them...

538
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,280
教练今天让我打四分卫了
So, uh, coach made me starting quarterback today.

539

爸爸 你下次一定要来看我的比赛
You gotta come to my next game, dad.

541
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,720
我是认真的 我现在打得更好了
I'm serious. I'm better now.

It's been a long time.

543

You want to go next?

551

伊森身上的味道突然不一样了
Ethan had a different smell all of a sudden.

552
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,780
一股汗味
A sweaty smell.

553
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,510
有人想坐那个过山车吗
Who wants to go on that roller coaster?

554
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:38,480
不知道这跟那个女孩儿有没有关系
Hmm. I wonder if that girl had anything to do with it.

555

我不会做那种事的
I wouldn't do that.

560
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,050
或许
Okay, well, maybe

561
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,120
你该教狗懂点礼貌

My butt itches.

569
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,100
帅哥 你叫什么

576
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,600
别让他够着那个
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Keep that away from him.

577
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,380
- 好好好  - 你真的很擅长这个

578
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,650
谢谢
Thanks.

579
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,940
- 确实很好  - 真的吗
- Like, really good.  - Yeah?

580
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,720
我刚刚在那边看你来着
I was watching you over there.

581
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,560
不是那样的
Not like that.

582
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,810
我是说
I mean... yeah.

583
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,680
再见
See ya.

584
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,210
如果我们以后不会再见面的话
Hey, uh, if we never speak again,

585
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,020
我想收回我之前的那句话
I just want to take back what I said before

586
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,950
我刚刚说我的狗不聪明
about my dog not being smart.

587
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,630
但他其实很聪明
He's actually really smart.

588
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,140
绝对比我聪明
Definitely smarter than me.

589
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,080
现在他们俩身上都有那种汗味了
Now they both had a sweaty smell.

590
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,890
你想去 你想去买个热狗之类的吗
You want to, uh... you want to get a hot dog or something?

591
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,300
爆米花呢
Popcorn?

592
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,010

贝利 过来

596
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:16,890
我想去救他们 但我不知道怎么救
I wanted to save them, but I didn't know how.

597
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,420

谢谢你呀
Thank you.

601
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,420
伊森有麻烦了
Uh-oh, Ethan's in trouble.

602
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,100

Thank you. Thank you both for the ride.

611
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,490
我刚刚为什么要吃这么多热狗
Why did I eat so many meat logs?

612
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,220
我们应该一起做些什么
Yeah, we should do something.

613

会很不错的
Yes, that would be nice.

614
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,240
今天玩得很开心
It was fun.

615
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,790
是的
It was.

616
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,200
除了要买下二十八个热狗 都很好
Except for having to pay for 28 hot dogs.

617
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,120
不好意思
excuse me.

618
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,560
- 你最好快点走了 快点走吧  - 好吧

620
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,430
从那时起
From that moment on,

621
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:29,020
这个女孩儿就成了我们的一员
the girl was a member of our pack.

622
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,400
我喜欢她
I liked her.

623
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,940
而且她闻起来像饼干的味道
Plus she smelled like biscuits.

624
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,040
去 去 贝利
Go! Go, Bailey!

625

- Oh! Good boy!  - What a dive.

629
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,060

00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,060
- 真棒  - 游啊

00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:54,590
- 来  - 真棒
- Come on.  - Oh, good boy!

635
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:57,440
- 真棒 真棒  - 是啊 真棒
- Good boy. Good boy.  - Yeah, good boy.

636
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,360
小心头
Watch your head.

637
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,850
真棒
Good boy.

638
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,300
- 不 这不可以  - 不
- No, it's not okay.  - No.

639
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,630
反正我也要走了
Besides, I'm going.

640
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,250
- 为什么  - 因为你从不听我说话
- Why?   - You don't listen!

641
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,430
每次我问你那些东西去哪了的时候…
Every time I ask you where something comes from...

642
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,410
你告诉我 你告诉我那些东西去哪了
You tell me! You tell me where it's going!

643
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,970
因为是我挣来的 我挣来的 我挣来的
Cause I earn it! I earn it! I earn it!

644
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:19,190
要不我们去城里吧
You, uh... you want to go to town instead?

645
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,670
好的
Yeah.

646
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,440
- 贝利  - 走吧 贝利
- Bailey.  - Come on, Bailey!

647
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,970
我们一起嚎叫
We howled together.

648
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,030
有时候我们就坐在车里
And sometimes we would sit in the car

649
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,150
哪里都不去
not even going anywhere.

650
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:58,270
伊森和汉娜会缠在一起舔对方
Ethan and Hannah would wrestle and lick each other.

651
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,180
他们是在抢食物吗
Are they fighting over food?

652
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:06,450
也许汉娜在她嘴里藏了点什么
Maybe Hannah's hiding something in her mouth.

653
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,390
没 什么也没有
Nope. Nothing in there.

654
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,420
我的天… 你是怎么了
Oh, my... What's going on with you?

655
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,060
它喜欢你
Man, he loves you.

656
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,520
但是不管他
But no matter how much

657
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,560
多努力在那里找食物 他从没找到过什么
he looked for food in there, he never found anything.

658
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,080
而且他
And he looked.

659
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,780
找了很多遍
A lot.

660
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,510
你能感觉的到
You can feel it.

661
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,920
夏天要结束了
Summer's ending.

662
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,320
是最好的夏天了
Best summer ever.

663
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,700
是的
Yeah.

664
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,800
我不想回学校
I don't want to go back to school.

665
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,020
你想的
Yes, you do.

666
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,540
我想
I do?

667
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,140
是的
Yes.

668
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,700
你会在一个好学校
You are gonna get a big football scholarship

669
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,240
得到一大笔橄榄球奖学金
at a good school.

670
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,610
我会申请那个学校
And then I'm gonna apply to that school

671
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,230
然后得到一笔学术奖学金
and get an academic scholarship.

672
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,080
我们都会上大学
And then we'll both be at college,

673
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,890
然后永远不会分开
and we'll never be apart.

674
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,890
你把一切都计划好了啊
You've got it all planned out, huh?

675
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,470
的确是的
Yes, indeed.

676
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,340
这是个好计划
That's a good plan.

677
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,650
对吧 贝利
Right, Bailey?

678
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:15,140

What? What did you say?

679

Good boy.

683
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,460
我得走了
I gotta go.

684
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,310
你要去哪
Where are you going?

685
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,270
我要去喝点啤酒
I'm getting some beer.

686
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,670
我只是想让你声音放小一点
All I ask is for you to lower your voice.

687
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,430
- 我就这点…  - 别说了 别说了

你听见了没
You hear me?

726

735
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,640
伊森变成我们的头了
Ethan was the leader of our pack.

736
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,980
当我们回家后 情况和之前不一样了
When we went home, things were different.

737
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,210
爸爸走了
Dad was gone.

738
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,330
那只猫躲了我好久

739
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,720
现在我找到他了

猛虎队夺得首攻

748
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,850
外接手接到传球
Pass caught by wide receiver...

749
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,700

I just said okay.

765
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,430

775
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,580
而且和往常一样 心情很差
And in one of his bad moods, too.

776
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,180
我闻得出来
I could smell it.

00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,780
投球投得不错
You got a good arm.

787
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,240

Let's cheer for this guy!

792
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:22,830

是贝利的
For Bailey?

799
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,530
狗老大 真乖
Hey, boss dog. Good boy.

800
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,300
原来伊森的世界也并非十全十美啊
So it's not all perfect in Ethan land, huh?

801
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,280
难怪你要逃到密歇根去了
Now I know why you're going to Michigan, man.

802
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,880
想离你的酒鬼老爸远点儿吗
Get away from that alchy father of yours.

803
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,070
- 你最好闭嘴 托德  - 是吗
- You should shut up, Todd.  - Oh, yeah?

804
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,050
你 你不想让所有人都知道
You-you don't want everyone here knowing

805
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,280
你老爸是个酒鬼吗
that your father's a drunk?

806
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,930
伊森 我还得赶公交 走吧
Ethan, I have to catch my bus. Please.

807
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,190
显然大家都知道了
It's pretty obvious.

808
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,570
- 我们走吧  - 好 一会儿就走
- Can we go?  - Yeah, we're going soon.

809
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,770
他女朋友也开始心疼他了
Oh, oh, and his girlfriend's fighting his battles, too.

810
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,930
如果密歇根州大知道这样的你…
If Michigan state knew the real Ethan...

811
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,070
天呐
Whoa!

812
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,570
我说过让你闭嘴 托德
I told you to shut up, Todd.

813
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,010
我不喜欢这个味道
I don't like that smell.

814
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,880
我们上车吧
Please get in the car.

815
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,190
贝利 快点
Bailey, come on!

816
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,290
贝利 快过来 上车
Bailey, let's go. Get in the car.

817
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,440
什么声音
What was that?

818
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,410
是松鼠吗
Could that be that squirrel?

819
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,790
完美
Perfect.

820
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,600
托德闯进了我们的地盘
Todd was on our territory.

821
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,310
我真想咬他
Oh, I wanted to bite him.

822
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,180
但是伊森不让我咬人
But I remembered Ethan telling me no biting.

823
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,230
不管了
Then I forgot.

824
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,880
停下 停下 别咬
No, no, no, no, no!

825
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,290
伊森
Ethan.

826
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,020
贝利
Bailey.

827
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,960
贝利 别吵
Bailey, shut up.

828
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,830
妈妈
Mom!

829
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,650

836
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,450
- 跳下去  - 不行 太高了

00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,750
- 给你  - 把床单绑起来
- Here. Here.  - I just want to tie these together.

839
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,250
附近有梯子吗
Anyone have a ladder handy?

840
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:58,160
我们得把他们弄下来
We gotta help 'em down!

841
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,000
- 天呐  - 这是唯一一条生路了
- Oh, god.  - It's the only way, okay?

842

快去检查一下房子后面
Check the back of the house.

844
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:11,900
快搭把手
Somebody give me a hand!

抱歉
I'm so sorry.

903
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,000
尽管他走到哪儿
Even though he carried

904
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,090
都带着那根漂亮的新棍子
a great new stick everywhere he went.

905
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,630
贝利 不要

908
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,140
我再也请不动他和我玩了
I couldn't make him play with me.

909
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,970
他只想睡觉
All he wanted to do was sleep.

910
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:21,100
现在我的自由时间充裕 所以交了个新朋友
I had a lot of free time now, so I made a new friend.

911
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,240
它像只小马
It was like a small horse.

912
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,810
或巨狗
Or a giant dog.

913
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,220
它身上有种独特的气味
With its own special smell

914
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,010
十分美妙又特别恶心
that was so wonderful and disgusting.

915
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:33,410
真希望我能进去打滚
Oh, I wished I could roll in it.

916
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:40,810
我们玩得超开心
Oh, we had fun.

917
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,550
直到它不高兴了
Until we didn't.

918
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,540
至少汉娜仍会来玩
At least Hannah still came around.

919

来 来
Come on. Come on!

925
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,930
你 你想去池塘那边吗
You, um... do you want to go to the pond?

926
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:13,000
我做了些三明治
I made some sandwiches.

927
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:14,990

I mean...

929
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,490
如果你想的话
Yeah, if you want.

930
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,820
我只是 想着如果我们离开屋子
I just... I thought it'd be nice

931
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:23,380
让你出去转转 挺好的
if we could get out of the house, get you out.

932
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:32,650
怎么了
What?

933
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:35,100
汉娜 我知道你是好心
Look, Hannah, it's nice for you to try,

934
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,250

935
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,390
你不用帮我
You don't have to help me.

936
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:43,280
我不是为了你
I'm not doing it for you.

937
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,560
是为了我们 我想
I'm doing it for us. I want...

938

不 你就是为了我才这么做的
No, you're doing this for me.

939
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:50,510
三周后你就去上大学了
You leave for college in three weeks.

940

拖着这条废腿
With that.

943
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:02,030
你不能再自怨自艾了
You have to stop feeling sorry for yourself.

944
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,350
你不能为我这么做 汉娜

我愿意为你做任何事

我们不该继续在一起了
We shouldn't be with each other anymore.

00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:37,190
再见 伊森
Bye, Ethan.

989
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,200
一路顺风
Drive safe.

990
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:40,710
拜拜 伊森
See you, Ethan!

991
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,730
不要 贝利
No, Bailey.

992
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:50,050
- 站住  - 你牵住它 亲爱的
- Stay.  - You got him, honey?

993
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:52,230
站住 我们玩接球呢
Stay? We're playing fetch.

994
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:53,210
贝利
Bailey!

995
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:55,960
我们已经很久没一起玩了
It's been so long since we've played.

996
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,020
贝利
Bailey.

997
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,740
我喜欢这个新版本的接球游戏
I like this new version of fetch.

998
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:41,540
你是不是疯了 狗老大
You're crazy, you know that, boss dog?

999
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,120
只是下次能不能…别开这么远
Maybe not... Drive so far next time.

1000
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,190
帮我照看好这里的一切 好吗
Take care of things around here for me, okay, boy?

1001
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:54,750
我很快就回来
I'll be back soon.

1002
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:56,330
答应我
Promise.

1003
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:03,680
好了 去吧 回家
Come on. Go on. Go home.

1004
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:12,920
人类很复杂
Humans are complicated.

1005
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:15,520
他们总做些狗狗不懂的事情
They do things dogs can't understand.

1006
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:17,350
比如离别
Like leave.

1007
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:22,020
伊森和我注定要在一起
Ethan and I were meant to be together.

1008
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:23,910
但如果伊森不在了
But if there was no Ethan,

1009
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:26,320
我活着还有什么意义
what was the point of my being here?

1010
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,360
也许意义就在于不要寻找意义
Maybe the point was not to look for a point.

1011
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:33,970
好了 等一下
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

1012
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:37,870
我很快回来 贝利
I'll be right back, Bailey.

1013
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,250
现在 一切都以缓慢的步调流逝
Everything moved at a slower pace now.

1014
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:43,940
没关系
Which was okay,

1015
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:46,380
反正我也不想再跑了
because I never felt like running anymore.

1016
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:50,660
我经常觉得累
I was tired all the time.

1017
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:56,230
不再想着玩儿
I didn't feel like playing anymore.

1018
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:00,000
哪怕是跟小马狗
Not even with horse-dog.

1019
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,890
贝利
Hey, Bailey.

1020
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:11,480
你还好吗 孩子
Are you okay, boy?

1021
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,000
比尔
Bill?

1022
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:20,270
- 小心点 当心…  - 好的
- Careful. Keep a...  - Okay.

1023
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,110
它怎么了
Okay, let's see what we have here.

1024
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:25,830
它的眼睛看起来不大对劲
His eyes just didn't look right.

1025
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:28,260
有…有很多眼屎
They just, uh... they were... They were kind of rheumy.

1026
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,270
而且它…老是喘气
And he... and he was panting, he was, uh...

1027
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:31,910
呼吸很沉重
His breathing was labored.

1028
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,650
它身上还起了个小肿块
He's-he's also got this little lump in his, uh...

1029
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:36,470
对 它有没有
Oh, yeah. Has he been drinking

1030
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:38,250
- 大量喝水和尿尿  - 没有
- a lot of water and peeing?  - No.

1031
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:40,440
昏昏欲睡 它…不太想出去散步了
Lethargic, so he... he doesn't want to go for walks anymore?

1032
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,470
我都不得不把它抱进车里
I had to carry him into the car.

1033
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:45,520
医生 你觉得 我们能为它做点什么
What can we do for him, doctor? What do you think?

1034
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,100
我们…我们可以做个检查
Well, we-we... We could do testing,

1035
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:52,050
但恐怕还是一样的结果
but I'm afraid that it would probably be the same results.

1036
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,970
它的…它的肾功能在衰退
His... his kidneys are shutting down.

1037
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:56,010
我们能不能…
Can we just...

1038
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,520
大家都很难过
Everyone was so sad,

1039
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:00,480
但是我已经没力气去逗他们开心了
but I was too tired to cheer them up.

1040
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,000
乔伊斯医生 我能不能借用下你电话
Dr. Joyce, can I, uh... Can I use your phone?

1041
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,020
当然可以
Yes. Oh, absolutely.

1042
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:06,360
医生 医生 如果这是个人
Doctor, doctor, uh, if this was a person,

1043
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,300
如果它是个人 你是兽医
if this was a person... you're the veterinarian...

1044
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,730
如果它是个人 是不是意味着…
if this was a person, would you say that...

1045
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:18,490
你好
Uh, hello.

1046
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:20,650
我想找伊森
Yeah, uh, I'm looking for Ethan.

1047
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,180
我是他外公 比尔
It's his grandpa, Bill.

1048
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,880
伊森 我是外公
Ethan, it's grandpa.

1049
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,010
伊森
Ethan.

1050
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,080
你来了吗
Are you here?

1051
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:31,960
我闻不到你
I can't smell you.

1052
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,690
你在哪儿
Where are you?

1053
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,190
贝利
Hey, Bailey.

1054
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,410
他来了
There he was.

1055
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,770
我知道他很难过
I could tell he was still sad.

1056
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,740
我不想让他难过
I didn't want him to be sad.

1057
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,310
小笨狗
Doodle dog.

1058
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,010
狗老大
Boss dog, huh?

1059
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,490
我知道我来到这世上是为了爱伊森
I knew I was here to love Ethan

1060
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,280
让他快乐
and make him happy.

1061
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,350
贝利 贝利 贝利 贝利
Oh, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.

1062
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:11,510
我不想就这样离开他
I didn't want to leave him like this.

1063
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:16,330
乖孩子
Good boy.

1064
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,390
乖孩子 贝利
Good boy, Bailey.

1065
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:20,830
别担心
Don't worry.

1066
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:23,840
他只会感觉到脖子上一丁点…小刺痛
He'll just feel a little... A little prick in his neck,

1067
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:26,670
然后就可以安息了
and then the pain will go away.

1068
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:42,210
一切又重新开始了
And then it happened again.

1069
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,380
妈妈 乳汁
The mother, the milk,

1070
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:46,520
舌头 温暖
the tongue, the warmth.

1071
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:47,930
我回来了
I was back.

1072
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,120
但为什么
But why?

1073
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,310
伊森去哪儿了
Where was Ethan?

1074
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:53,560
有些东西也不见了
Other things were missing, too.

1075
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,490
我怎么没有…
I didn't have a...

1076
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,530
什么 我是个女孩
What? I'm a girl?

1077
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,240
过来 过来
Come on, come on!

1078
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,480
乖孩子 乖孩子
Good girl, good girl.

1079
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,870
我的主人很严肃
My man was very serious.

1080
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:04,750
注意
Look.

1081
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:08,050
- 过 过  - 我们工作很辛苦
- Over. Over. Good girl!  - We worked hard.

1082
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:11,230
就算是玩 也被他搞得像在工作
Even when we played, he made it feel like work.

1083
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:13,410
放松 下 下
Easy. Down, down.

1084
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:15,950
找到沃利 搜寻开始
Find Wally. Search! Go!

1085
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:23,780
沃利真是让人头疼
Wally was a disaster,

1086
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,760
老在掉东西
always losing pieces of clothing.

1087
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:29,940
你找到他了
You found him.

1088
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,960
真棒
Good job. Okay.

1089
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:36,880
[埃莉]
[芝加哥警犬]

1090
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:42,500
难道这就是我的使命
So this is my purpose?

1091
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,900
跟玩乐无关
It's not about fun.

1092
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,980
- 跟伊森无关  - 来 乖孩子
- It's not about Ethan.  - Come on. Good girl.

1093
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,480
我的工作就是搜寻 查找
My job is to seek, find

1094
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,000
和展示
and show.

1095
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,760
真棒 乖孩子
Good job. Good job.

1096
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:03,030
但即使我做得很棒
But even when I did a good job,

1097
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,050
我的主人也还是不开心
my man was still sad.

1098
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,810
他很孤单
He was lonely.

1099
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:13,290
我知道曾经有人也住在这里
I could smell someone else used to live here,

1100
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:14,950
但他们的气味很微弱
but their scent was faint.

1101
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:17,590
他们已经很久没出现在这屋子里了
They hadn't been around in a long time.

1102
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,430
这时我开始意识到
That's when I realized

1103
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:24,890
世上最糟糕的事 莫过于孤单
being alone might be the worst thing that could happen to you.

1104
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:30,700
我知道想念一个人是什么感觉
I knew how it felt to miss someone.

1105
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,460
他也在想念某个人吗
Did he miss someone, too?

1106
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:45,480
不可以
Stop that.

1107
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:48,880
怎么了
What?

1108
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,180
睡你自己的床 快去
Dog bed-- now.

1109
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:55,560
埃莉…
Ellie...

1110
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,320
睡自己的床 去
Dog bed-- now.

1111
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:03,660
为什么我要听他的
Why did I listen to him?

1112
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,010
我不想走
I didn't want to go.

1113
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:09,170
而且我知道 他也不希望我走
And I could tell he didn't want me to go, either.

1114
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:14,140
天啊
Oh, gosh.

1115
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:19,220
能不能让我省点心
Would you give me a break?

1116
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,850
不许发牢骚
No whining.

1117
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,330
这是枪
Gun.

1118
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:50,940
枪闻起来有股刺鼻的味道
Gun had a smell that stung my nose.

1119
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:52,860
乖乖的
Steady.

1120
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,230
坐好
Stay.

1121
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,520
放松
Relax.

1122
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:59,020
习惯了就好了
Get used to it.

1123
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:02,570
要坚强
Stay strong.

1124
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:09,780
乖狗狗
Good girl.

1125
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:21,770
怎么了
Yes?

1126
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:28,030
什么
What?

1127
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:38,190
那个我也会
I could do that, too.

1128
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:50,590
我找不到拒绝的理由
You know, I don't see why not.

1129
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,900
上来 上来
Come on. Come on.

1201

像阳光和椒盐卷饼的味道

我看得出来她很伤心

1212

我得哄她开心

1213
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:21,990
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1214
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:23,460
我的尾巴呢

1215

咦 我的尾巴去哪了

1216

1218
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:34,180
玛雅去哪都带着我

1219
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,520

1220
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,210
根据美国哲学家

人类只用符号思考

1223

她总是给我带吃的

Oh... oh, but I didn't say when we was meeting.

1234
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:12,200

1235
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:14,250

No, I just... I'm busy. I...

1236
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:15,810
我知道我会很忙…
Like, I know I'm gonna be busy and, like...

1237
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:17,380
我还得照顾我的狗 所以我…

1238

谢谢你 我得走了

I don't know what's wrong with me, Tino.

1244
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:31,370

Like, yeah, maybe it would be nice to meet people, but...

1245
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,230
不 我也该一个人学习因为…
No, also I should just study alone 'cause...

1246
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:35,000
慢着点 慢着点
Slow down. Slow down.

1247

我只有小短腿
My legs are barely even legs.

1248
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:38,430
我觉得自己真蠢
Ugh! I feel like such an idiot.

1249
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:41,290
我很快明白了 虽然玛雅总是在说话
I learned quickly that even though Maya talked all the time,

1250

她很像卡洛斯

我们的小团体里没有别人了

这可能有些可笑 但有时

1266
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,760
我真的觉得你知道我在想什么

Ugh. Do you know, I'm spending way too much time alone.

1269
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,250
你想吃点冰淇淋吗
You want to go get some ice cream?

1270
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,060
你懂我
You read my mind.

1271
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:35,500
我觉得可能就这样了 蒂诺
I think this is it, Tino.

1272
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,440
我觉得我们只能相依为命了
I think it's just gonna be you and me.

1273
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:43,390
我不知道 这也挺好的 对吗
I-I don't know. It's fine, right?

1274
01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:47,230
因为我爱你 你也爱我
Because I love you and you love me, and...

1275
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,500
唯一重要的就是爱
Love is all that matters.

1276
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:53,630
从哪儿得到的爱并不重要
It's not like it matters where you get your love.

1277
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:57,280
只要有东西爱你 对吗
As long as something loves you, right?

1278
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,670
我能再来点吗
Can I have some more?

1279
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,850
你真贴心
Oh, you're so sweet.

1280
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,990
你真可爱
You're so cute.

1281
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:12,280
我爱你
Hi. I love you.

1282
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:15,300
你为什么就不能是我男友呢
Why can't you be my boyfriend, huh?

1283
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,230
你为什么就不能再给我点冰淇淋呢
Why can't you give me more ice cream?

1284
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,110
还剩一针
--Okay, one more to go.

1285
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:22,460
这些穿白大褂的人类
What's with these white-coat people

1286
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,090
干吗总是用尖东西扎我
sticking me with sharp things?

1287
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:25,950
你按时喂他吗
Now, do you feed him at regular times?

1288
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:27,840
挺有规律的
Pretty regular.

1289
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:29,520
你都给他吃什么
What do you give him?

1290
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:30,960
吃的
Food.

1291
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:32,270
狗粮 怎么了
Dog food. What?

1292
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,940
或许你应该让他多锻炼些
Maybe give him more exercise.

1293
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:36,640
多遛遛
Go on more walks.

1294
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,470
没问题
Sure.

1295
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:40,650
扎针 我讨厌扎针
Shots. I hate those shots.

1296
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,510
好了 蒂诺
Okay, Tino.

1297
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:43,250
我们来做运动吧
Let's do this, huh?

1298
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:44,810
这是医嘱 过来吧
Doctor's orders. Come here.

1299
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:46,710
好了 捡球去
All right, get the ball.

1300
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,690
走了那么久 现在我又得捡球去
A long walk, and now I have to chase a ball?

1301
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:51,280
把球捡回来 快点
Get the ball. Come on.

1302
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:53,010
我为什么被这般惩罚
Why was I being punished like this?

1303
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:53,870
蒂诺 快点 你是只狗
Tino, come on. You're a dog.

1304
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:55,670
追球去 快去追
Get... chase the ball. Chase it.

1305
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:57,960
- 快点 蒂诺  - 幸运儿
- Come on, Tino.  - Lucky.

1306
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,240
蒂诺 这真是太丢人了 好吗
Tino, this is embarrassing, okay?

1307
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,180
- 快去吧  - 对不起 今天不行
- Just, come on.  - Sorry, not today.

1308
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:03,940
- 捡球去  - 我没那心情
- Get the ball.  - I'm not in the mood.

1309
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,920
之后我看见了她
And then I saw her.

1310
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,630
一切都变了
And everything changed.

1311
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:12,800
我的心激动起来
My heart was aflutter.

1312
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:21,230
抓得真棒
What a catch.

1313
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:30,080
蒂诺 把它带回给我
Tino, bring it back to me.

1314
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:37,020
你也与我感同身受吗
Are you feeling what I'm feeling?

1315
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:38,550
对不起
Hey, I'm sorry.

1316
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,350
我的狗今天怪怪的
My dog's acting so weird today.

1317
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:42,130
- 不 没事的  - 我们走吧
- No, it's okay.  - Come on, boy. Let's go.

1318
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:43,820
快点 你想追这个吗
Come on, are you gonna chase this?

1319
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,560
- 等一下  - 你好
- Wait a minute.  - Oh. Hey.

1320
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:49,420
你和我都上肯特教授的课
You and I both have, uh, Professor Kenter.

1321
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:50,870
是啊
Right. Yeah.

1322
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:54,910
我叫艾尔
I'm-I'm Al.

1323
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:56,170
好的 我叫玛雅
Oh. Okay, I'm Maya.

1324
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,890
- 很高兴认识你  - 我很抱歉
- Nice to meet you.  - I'm sorry...

1325
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:00,540
玛雅在说着话 但我不在听
Maya was talking, but I didn't listen.

1326
01:07:00,590 --> 01:07:02,460
我脑子里都是她
All I could think of was her.

1327
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:03,590
没事的 我理解的
It's cool. I... No, I, understand.

1328
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:05,400
它一遇到你的狗就像疯了似的
So he's, like, acting crazy around your dog.

1329
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:09,810
干吗不肯呢
Why fight it?

1330
01:07:09,970 --> 01:07:11,770
我们闻起来好配
We smell great together.

1331
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:19,530
我们开始天天都能见到罗西
We started seeing Roxy all the time.

1332
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:22,800
不知为什么 艾尔也总是会来
For some reason, Al always came, too.

1333
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:25,800
没过多久
It wasn't long before...

1334
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,340
我们就睡在一起了
We slept together.

1335
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,710
我真的开始懂了
I'm really starting to get it now.

1336
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:38,610
如果活着有意义 罗西就是那个意义
If there's a point, Roxy is the point.

1337
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,790
慢着 出什么事了
Wait. What's going on?

1338
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:45,970
玛雅
Um, Maya?

1339
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:48,310
我心里有些话
There's been something on my mind

1340
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:50,200
一直想告诉你
that I've been wanting to talk to you about.

1341
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:53,200
我记得那个汗湿的气味
Oh, I recognize that sweaty smell.

1342
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,470
我们已经在一起一段时间了
We've been together for a while now.

1343
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:04,640
玛雅 我想让你成为我的妻子
--Maya, I want you to be my wife.

1344
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,850
- 艾尔 我的天哪  - 事情不太对劲
- Al! Oh, my god!  - Something's wrong here.

1345
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:07,740
- 我愿意  - 玛雅有危险
- Yes!  - Maya's in trouble.

1346
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:09,990
我愿意 过来
Yes! Yay! Come here!

1347
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:12,300
- 亲爱的 我愿意  - 太棒了
- Oh, honey, yes!  - Yeah.

1348
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:14,710
这儿有危险 躲到我身后 罗西
There is danger. Get behind me, Roxy.

1349
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,360
我会保护大家的
I'll protect us all!

1350
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:18,640
艾尔
Al!

1351
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:20,760
我牵住蒂诺了
Okay. I got Tino. I got Tino. I got Tino.

1352
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,550
等一下等一下
Okay, wait, wait. Hold on!

1353
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,450
不 罗西 别这样
No, Roxy. Stop it!

1354
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:29,630
妈妈 拿一下这些花
Okay. Mom, hold the... Hold these.

1355
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:31,840
好了 过来吧
Okay, come here. Come on.

1356
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:34,330
- 我觉得我们准备好了  - 我们开始吧
- I think we're ready.  - Okay, let's do this.

1357
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:35,410
完美
Okay, perfect.

1358
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:37,150
准备好
Ready.

1359
01:08:38,970 --> 01:08:41,150
你很嫉妒因为法伦有了孩子
You're jealous because Fallon's had her baby,

1360
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:43,340
这使得你更偏执多疑了
and that's made you even more paranoid.

1361
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:45,660
亚历克西斯会被揍的
Alexis gonna get her butt whupped

1362
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:47,140
- 要是她还这么口无遮拦  - 是吧
- she keep running off the mouth like that.  - Right?

1363
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:49,180
因为克里斯塔尔再也受不了这事了
'Cause Krystle's not gonna take much more of this.

1364
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:51,770
- 我没有  - 这太疯狂了
- I haven't.  - This is crazy.

1365
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:53,290
我给你说了吧 我给你说了吧
I told you. I told you.

1366
01:08:53,290 --> 01:08:55,190
我的天啊
Oh, my gosh.

1367
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,850
- 什么  - 打她 克里斯塔尔
- What?  - Oh, get her, Krystle.

1368
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,710
我的天啊
Oh, my gosh.

1369
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:01,220
她的肚子里是什么声音
What's all that noise in her stomach?

1370
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:03,650
是她吃的东西的声音吗
Was it something she ate?

1371
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:06,870
她们要杀了对方啊
Yo, they're trying to kill each other.

1372
01:09:08,070 --> 01:09:09,190
什么
What?

1373
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:11,800
不
Oh, no.

1374
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:16,040
- 这是一个宝宝  - 她在呼吸吗
- It was a baby.  - Is she breathing?

1375
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:17,020
你要放松点 亲爱的
You gotta relax, honey.

1376
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:18,910
她在呼吸呢 好吧
She's breathing, okay?

1377
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:20,980
也许我们应该叫醒她来确认一下
Uh, maybe we should wake her up just to be sure.

1378
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:23,510
我不明白为什么他们要生个宝宝
I didn't understand why they got a baby.

1379
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,270
这把他们的注意力都转移走了
It took all their attention.

1380
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,420
幸好罗西和我有所需的一切
Good thing roxy and I already had everything we needed.

1381
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:30,420
我们彼此
Each other.

1382
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:31,910
小宝宝
Hey, baby.

1383
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:33,920
后来他们生了更多的宝宝
Then they went and got more babies.

1384
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:36,220
看上去像是我的错
Seemed like a mistake to me.

1385
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:39,480
不久 我必须过着逃跑的生活了
Soon, I had to live my life on the run.

1386
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:41,260
找到他了
Found him!

1387
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,040
无处可逃
There was no escape.

1388
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:48,130
我允许他们对我为所欲为
I let them do what they wanted to me.

1389
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:53,050
我愿意做任何事情以便罗西可以安全
I'd do anything so that roxy could be safe.

1390
01:09:54,030 --> 01:09:57,340
那是我的使命 随时保护她
That was my mission: To protect her at all times.

1391
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:03,890
我想 说实话
I guess, if I was really honest,

1392
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,700
我喜欢得到所有的关注
I liked all the attention.

1393
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:16,910
随着罗西和我渐渐变老
As roxy and I got older,

1394
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,290
我们的关系更加稳固了
our connection grew stronger.

1395
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:23,520
她也一直如我们初见时
And she never lost the spark

1396
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,020
耀眼迷人
that drew me to her in the first place.

1397
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:30,620
有一天 罗西去看兽医了
One day, roxy went to the vet.

1398
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:33,970
她就再也没有回来过
And she never came back.

1399
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,410
看我 看我
Look at me! Look at me!

1400
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:41,160
每个人对我都很好
Everyone was good to me.

1401
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,170
但随着岁月的流逝 我很想念罗西
But as the years went by, I missed Roxy.

1402
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:49,230
没有她一切都不一样了
It just wasn't the same without her.

1403
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:02,640
蒂诺
Hey, tino.

1404
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:11,400
蒂诺
Hey, Tino.

1405
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:14,700
你知道我在想什么吗
You know what I'm thinking?

1406
01:11:14,990 --> 01:11:15,960
是的
Yes.

1407
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,740
我知道你在想什么
I know what you're thinking.

1408
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:19,040
披萨
Pizza.

1409
01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:23,740
不是吗
No?

1410
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:26,940
不是披萨吗
No pizza?

1411
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:28,790
我不饿
I'm not hungry.

1412
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:31,660
好吧
Okay.

1413
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:35,220
蒂诺…
Tino...

1414
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,270
你在想什么呢
What are you thinking?

1415
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:49,780
你在想什么呢
What are you thinking?

1416
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,770
蒂诺 你在想什么呢
Tino, what are you thinking?

1417
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:56,610
我在想我准备好了
I'm thinking I'm ready.

1418
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,190
这真的是我最美好的生活之一
One of my best lives, really.

1419
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:14,250
我回来了
I'm back.

1420
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:15,310
又一次
Again.

1421
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:17,590
但是为什么呢
But why?

1422
01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:24,850
- 小狗想要只小狗吗  - 你好啊 小朋友
- Puppies! Want a puppy?  - Hey there, little fella.

1423
01:12:24,850 --> 01:12:26,530
- 卖小狗了  - 想买一只吗
- Puppies for sale!  - Want to buy one?

1424
01:12:26,530 --> 01:12:28,450
有想买小狗的吗
Who wants a puppy?

1425
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:30,140
你好啊
Hi!

1426
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:34,350
我们又开始新生活了
Here we go again.

1427
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:35,930
看看我抱的是什么
Look what I got. Huh?

1428
01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:37,450
我看到了
Yeah, I am looking.

1429
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:38,930
看他多可爱啊
Look how cute he is.

1430
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:40,180
你太不理智了
You know, it's-it's crazy.

1431
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:41,860
谁来照顾他
Who's gonna take care of him?

1432
01:12:42,130 --> 01:12:43,390
我会的
I will.

1433
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:45,570
好了 我给他取名华夫饼
Come on. I named him waffles.

1434
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:46,870
不准进屋
Not inside.

1435
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:06,880
吃吧
Come on.

1436
01:13:11,570 --> 01:13:14,190
我一直告诉她你会越长越大
I kept telling her you were going to get bigger.

1437
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,650
所以她现在不太喜欢你了 对吧
Not so into you now, is she?

1438
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,510
我哪里都没有去过
I never went anywhere.

1439
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:21,940
我从未玩耍过
I never played.

1440
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:25,820
感觉就像没有我日子也会一天天过去
It was like the days went on and on without me.

1441
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:29,210
你有三十天的时间来处理掉这个
You have 30 days to deal with this.

1442
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:30,430
当警察来的时候
When the officer came,

1443
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:33,260
我以为又是要领我去参加找东西表演
I thought it was to take me to do find-and-show.

1444
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:35,390
但她自己走了
But she left without me.

1445
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:36,810
他很脏 我们要把他赶走
He's dirty. We're getting rid of him.

1446
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:38,540
我们不能把狗赶走
We are not going to get rid of that dog.

1447
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:40,160
够了 我们要把他赶走
That's enough! We're getting rid of him.

1448
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:43,020
我把他带回来的 我们要照顾好他
I took him in here, and we're gonna take care of him.

1449
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:55,950
你保证可以给他找个好家庭 是吗
You'll make sure he finds a nice home, right?

1450
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,590
一个负责任的人
Somebody responsible?

1451
01:13:57,850 --> 01:13:58,680
是的
Yeah.

1452
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:10,170
快来 出来
Come on. Out.

1453
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:11,320
动起来
Move it.

1454
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:13,010
我们走 快来
Let's go. Come on.

1455
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,290
动起来
Move.

1456
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:23,340
再见 小狗
So long, doggie.

1457
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:35,940
现在我应该走回家吗
Now I'm supposed to walk home?

1458
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:38,300
这似乎太不公平了
That didn't seem very fair.

1459
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,720
但当我好好考虑后
But when I thought about it,

1460
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,820
我不想回到那个家了
I didn't want to go back to that home.

1461
01:14:51,710 --> 01:14:53,040
快来 来这里
Come on. Over here.

1462
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,320
看 妈妈
Look, mom.

1463
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,030
看起来很有趣
That looks like fun.

1464
01:14:57,030 --> 01:14:59,290
坐 坐 你喜欢那个吗
Sit. Sit. You like that?

1465
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,820
已经很久没有开心玩耍了
It's been so long since I've had fun.

1466
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:04,580
她要去哪里
Where is she going?

1467
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,290
我认识你吗
Do I know you?

1468
01:15:11,150 --> 01:15:13,320
你身上有些东西
There's something about you.

1469
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:16,690
是…你的味道
It's... your smell.

1470
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,030
你有点脏脏的
You're a scruffy one.

1471
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:20,940
你迷路了吗
Are you lost?

1472
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:22,650
你从哪里来的
Where are you from?

1473
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:26,000
你有颈圈吗
You got a collar?

1474
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:28,740
我知道那个味道
I know that smell.

1475
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,380
别害怕
Don't be afraid.

1476
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:34,500
那是…在很久以前
It's... from a long time ago.

1477
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:07,600
我之前来过这里吗
Had I been here before?

1478
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:11,540
真开心我能离开城市
I was so happy to leave the town behind.

1479
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,550
我鼻子充满了清新的味道
My nose was full of fresh new smells.

1480
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:23,350
这里有个味道你永不会忘记
And then there are the smells you never forget.

1481
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:26,640
火车 苔藓
Train. Moss.

1482
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:29,450
树木 马 垃圾
Trees. Horse. Garbage.

1483
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,180
是小马狗
It was horse-dog!

1484
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:00,520
会是一样的吗
Could it be the same?

1485
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:04,080
是一样的耶
Ah, it was the same.

1486
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:06,940
那是不是意味着伊森也曾在这
Could it mean Ethan was here, too?

1487
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:10,610
那应该够我们撑到月底
That ought to cover us to the end of the month.

1488
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:11,660
伊森
Ethan?

1489
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:14,870
不可能是他
That can't be him.

1490
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:17,800
告诉弗雷德我会去镇里
Tell Fred that I will be in town...

1491
01:17:17,890 --> 01:17:18,830
是他吗
Is that him?

1492
01:17:18,830 --> 01:17:20,380
明日去结账好吗
...tomorrow to settle up, okay?

1493
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:21,210
会跟他说的
Will do.

1494
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:23,080
是他
It is him!

1495
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:25,510
是他 太棒了
It's him! Yes!

1496
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:27,060
太棒了 是他
Yes, it's him!

1497
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:34,310
是我啊
It's me!

1498
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:36,610
狗老大 贝利贝利贝利
Boss dog! Bailey, Bailey, Bailey

1499
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:37,550
你的傻狗狗
doodle dog!

1500
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:39,410
你从哪来的
Where'd you come from?

1501
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:42,900
经过了这么世 我真的找到你了
After all these lives, I'd actually found him.

1502
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:44,300
我找到了伊森
I found Ethan.

1503
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:48,930
我敢打赌你饿了
I'm gonna make a bet you're hungry.

1504
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:52,020
吃吧
Here you go.

1505
01:17:56,690 --> 01:17:57,640
看来是真饿坏了
You must be.

1506
01:17:58,020 --> 01:17:59,420
没有人喜欢我煮的东西
Nobody likes my cooking.

1507
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:10,920
不要这样看着我
Don't look at me like that.

1508
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:14,400
你不能留在这
You can't stay here.

1509
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:16,640
你得回家去
You gotta go home.

1510
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:17,720
你有主人
You belong to somebody.

1511
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:19,860
家 对啊
Home. Yes.

1512
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:20,780
对 我回家了
Yes, I'm home.

1513
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:23,490
回家吧 狗狗
Go home, dog.

1514
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:29,560
回家吧
Go home.

1515
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:46,890
你是一条固执的狗狗 是吗
You're a stubborn one, aren't you?

1516
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:55,590
然后 周二晚间
Then, Tuesday night,

1517
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:57,610
降雨量为七十六毫米
we got three tenths of an inch of rain.

1518
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:11,370
确保它能找个好家
Be sure he gets a good home.

1519
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:12,870
它是一条好狗
He's a good dog.

1520
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:14,300
当然
Sure.

1521
01:19:15,170 --> 01:19:16,840
不不不 不要把我留在这
No. No, don't leave me here.

1522
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:19,260
这里是收容站
This is a white-coat place.

1523
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:20,840
我是你的
I belong with you.

1524
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:24,920
再见 狗狗
So long, dog.

1525
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:14,330
你想要离开这吗
You want to get out of here?

1526
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:18,880
你想走吗
Do you want to go?

1527
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:20,270
来吧 我们走
Come on, let's go.

1528
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,910
我又坐回了前排
I was back in the front seat.

1529
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:26,370
小家伙
Okay, buddy.

1530
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,260
看来我们俩要相依为命了
Guess it's gonna be you and me.

1531
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,410
还有那头驴
And the donkey.

1532
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:33,730
驴是什么
What's a donkey?

1533
01:20:36,230 --> 01:20:38,400
你上一次洗澡是什么时候
Now, when was the last time you got a bath?

1534
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:40,740
真是条乖狗
That's a good boy.

1535
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:44,230
洗好了
There you go. All right.

1536
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:46,010
爬出去 我们走
Just step out. Out. Let's go!

1537
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:48,920
干的好
There you go.

1538
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:56,410
[巴蒂]

1539
01:20:58,010 --> 01:20:59,390
你会得到一个新的项圈
You're getting a new collar.

1540
01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:03,520
看起来它可没有少吃
Doesn't look like he's missed too many meals.

1541
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,760
- 它体型很好  - 嗯 是条好狗
- He's in good shape.  - Yeah, he's a good boy.

1542
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:06,750
是不是啊
Aren't you, huh?

1543
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:14,640
但伊森似乎还是很伤心
But Ethan still seemed sad.

1544
01:21:16,190 --> 01:21:18,400
也许是因为他一个人睡
Maybe it was because he slept alone.

1545
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:22,740
我想要帮他 可我不知道如何帮
I wanted to help him, but I didn't know how.

1546
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,480
等等 等等
Wait. Wait.

1547
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:28,300
等一下
Hold that thought.

1548
01:21:32,350 --> 01:21:34,310
贝利 就这么办
Okay, Bailey, let's do this.

1549
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:35,370

1551
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:38,850
就是这儿了
This is the place.

1552
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:41,210
我在找…
I'm looking for...

1553

- Come on, Carly.  - Come on, Carly.

1555
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:50,190
快来 卡莉
Come here, Carly.

1556
01:21:51,650 --> 01:21:52,660
能帮我开下门吗
Can you get the gate for me?

1557
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:54,790
- 好的 妈妈  - 谢谢
- Yes, mommy.  - Thank you.

1558
01:21:55,670 --> 01:21:56,720
乖狗狗
Good girl.

1559
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:05,690
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

1560
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:08,210
瑞秋
Rach.

1561
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:11,640
快看 威尔
Oh, hey. Look, Will.

1562
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:12,710
- 外婆来了  - 外婆
- Grandma's here.  - Hi, grandma.

1563
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:14,000
那又有那种气味了
There's that smell again.

1564
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
- 最近感觉怎么样  - 挺好的
- How are you feeling?  - I'm pretty good.

1565
01:22:16,810 --> 01:22:18,110
真是个惊喜
This is a surprise.

1566
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:20,460
现在更浓了
It's stronger now.

1567
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:22,320
我觉得我该给你们准备些吃的了
I thought I'd bring you some groceries.

1568
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,080
- 是汉娜  - 谢谢
- It's Hannah!  - Aw. Hmm, thanks.

1569
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:25,700
你还在这
You're still here?

1570
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:27,820
虽然你看起来不一样了
Oh, you look different.

1571
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:30,770
但闻起来还像饼干一样
But you still smell like biscuits.

1572
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:36,080
这是谁的狗
Who is this?

1573
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:39,520
公园里的流浪狗
It's the, uh, stray from the park.

1574
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:42,400
流浪狗 真的吗
A stray? Really?

1575
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:46,730
你好哇
Well, hello there.

1576
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:49,060
多好一条狗啊
What a good dog.

1577
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:51,550
它肯定不是流浪狗
Well, he's certainly not a stray,

1578
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:53,610
因为它有项圈
'cause he's got a collar.

1579
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:54,430
让我看看
Let's see.

1580
01:22:55,450 --> 01:22:56,690
它的名字是巴蒂
His name is Buddy.

1581
01:22:57,570 --> 01:22:59,120
看看 它的主人是
Let's see. He belongs to...

1582
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:02,450
[伊森·蒙哥马利]

1583
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:08,510
出来啊 伊森
Come on, Ethan.

1584
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,400
我能闻出来你在里面
I can smell you in there.

1585
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:13,370
我不想把你留在这
I don't want to leave you here.

1586
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:16,220
但我想他应该不在家
But I guess he's not home.

1587
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:36,790
嗨 伊森
Hi, Ethan.

1588
01:24:39,570 --> 01:24:40,400
嗨 汉娜
Hi, Hannah.

1589
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,350
我把你的狗带回来了
I brought your dog home.

1590
01:24:56,370 --> 01:24:57,450
你一定过的很辛苦吧
Must have been tough on you,

1591
01:24:57,970 --> 01:24:59,860
多年前就失去了丈夫
losing your husband after all those years.

1592
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:03,050
嗯 所以我格外想念我的女儿
Yeah, it made me miss my daughter a lot.

1593
01:25:05,030 --> 01:25:06,180
然后 随着孙子的出生
And then, with the new baby coming,

1594
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:10,570
我觉得瑞秋和米格尔真的很需要帮手
I thought Rachel and Miguel could really use the help.

1595
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:11,610
嗯
Yeah.

1596
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:13,760
你要在这待多久啊
How long you get to stay for?

1597
01:25:16,230 --> 01:25:18,150
我不是来探亲的 伊森
Uh, well, I'm... I'm not visiting, Ethan.

1598
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:20,230
大概一个月前我就搬回来住了
I moved back about a month ago.

1599
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:22,240
你搬了吗
Y-you did?

1600
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:24,470
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

1601
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:26,880
谢谢
Thanks.

1602
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:33,480
这个地方还跟以前一样
Well, this place is still the same.

1603
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:34,770
对啊
Yeah.

1604
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:35,890
加油啊
Oh, come on.

1605
01:25:37,450 --> 01:25:38,490
那你呢
So, what about you?

1606
01:25:38,490 --> 01:25:41,250
你 你就再没遇上某个人或
You... you never met anyone or...

1607
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:43,090
找不到对的人
Never found the right fit.

1608
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:47,570
我真的很固执
I'm really stubborn.

1609
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:48,880
这点我知道
I know that.

1610
01:25:49,630 --> 01:25:51,820
当你把心思投入到一件事中 就是那样
When you put your mind to something, that was that.

1611
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:53,690
是的
Yeah.

1612
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:55,950
这样有助于把事情搞定
That's good for getting things done.

1613
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:57,910
但是不利于发展感情
It's not so good for relationships.

1614
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:01,830
好吧
Okay, well...

1615
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:05,060
好吧 就这样
Okay, here we go.

1616
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:06,740
它们会互相舔脸
They're gonna lick faces.

1617
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:09,720
这样非常好
Well, look, this was really nice.

1618
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:10,960
我得走了
I gotta go.

1619
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:12,800
谢谢你 伊森
Thank you, Ethan.

1620
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:14,560
等一下 什么
Wait, what?

1621
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:16,280
拜托
Oh, come on!

1622
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:18,260
谢谢你把我的狗带回来
Hey, thanks for bringing back my dog.

1623
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:20,510
不客气 再见
You're welcome. Bye.

1624
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:24,680
汉娜
Hey, Hannah.

1625
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:29,960
我…
I, uh...

1626
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:33,800
我欠你一句道歉
I owe you an apology.

1627
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:36,280
为我们之间发生的事情道歉
For what happened to us.

1628
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:38,050
以前的事
Back then.

1629
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:40,500
别担心
Well, don't worry.

1630
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,510
那是很久很久以前了
It was a long, long time ago.

1631
01:26:42,510 --> 01:26:43,240
不
No.

1632
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:44,200
我把你推开了
I pushed you away.

1633
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:47,850
而且我那时对这个世界真的很愤怒
And I was... I was really mad at the world.

1634
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:50,510
我只是想让你知道
And I just want you to know that not a day goes by

1635
01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:55,750
我每一天都在为那样做后悔
that I don't kick myself for doing that.

1636
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:58,560
这就是那种流汗的味道
There's that sweaty smell.

1637
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:01,060
你觉得
You think, uh,

1638
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:04,330
如果我们一起做点什么
it'd be crazy if...

1639
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:09,750
是件疯狂的事吗
we did something together?

1640
01:27:11,710 --> 01:27:13,520
你是想跟我约会吗
Are you asking me out on a date?

1641
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:18,130
我只是觉得如果我就看着你开车走了
Well, I just think that I'd be an all-time fool

1642
01:27:18,130 --> 01:27:21,280
那我就是个大大的白痴
if I just watched you drive away.

1643
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:25,130
别说话了 快用鼻子吧
Enough talking. Use your nose.

1644
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:26,020
不要
Then don't.

1645
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:41,320
好的 现在你们做对了
Okay, now you're getting it.

1646
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:49,140
好的 太棒了
Yes! Yes!

1647
01:27:53,230 --> 01:27:54,030
离这儿远点
Get out of here.

1648
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:54,970
给他们点空间
Give 'em some space.

1649
01:28:03,450 --> 01:28:05,060
那边有一点 这就是为什么…
Few right there, that's why...

1650
01:28:05,070 --> 01:28:06,780
你好啊 小可爱
Hi, you little cutie pie.

1651
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:09,590
我的水里有薄荷
Ew. My water has mint in it.

1652
01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:12,680
你开心吗
You have a good time?

1653
01:28:15,330 --> 01:28:17,240
它们一旦开始互相舔脸
Once they started licking faces,

1654
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:18,560
就没人能阻止了
no one could stop them.

1655
01:28:19,450 --> 01:28:21,410
伊森终于得到他需要的了
Ethan finally had what he needed.

1656
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:22,870
他很开心
He was happy.

1657
01:28:24,570 --> 01:28:25,820
我也很开心
I was happy, too.

1658
01:28:27,570 --> 01:28:28,640
不好意思 大家
Excuse me, everybody.

1659
01:28:29,150 --> 01:28:32,890
我想感谢你们今天能够来到这里
I-I would like to thank you all for coming here today.

1660
01:28:33,870 --> 01:28:36,110
- 这对汉娜和我很重要  - 干杯
- It means a lot to Hannah and I.  - Cheers.

1661
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:37,710
我一直想要有个大家庭
I've always wanted a big family.

1662
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:39,780
在一天之内 我就拥有了一个
All in one day, I've got one.

1663
01:28:39,790 --> 01:28:41,330
你没说它有多大
You didn't tell me how big it was.

1664
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:45,260
我只想说说我有多感恩
I just would like to say how grateful I am

1665
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:47,630
我美丽的女孩

1666
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,330
重新回到了我的生命中
walked back into my life.

1667
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:51,850
谢谢你
Thank you.

1668
01:28:52,850 --> 01:28:53,920
生命就是个谜
Life's a mystery.

1669
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:55,400
干杯
Cheers.

1670
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:01,920
我还想要做一件事
There was one thing I still wanted.

1671
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:04,020
我想要他知道那是我
I wanted him to know it was me.

1672
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:05,760
我们昨晚非常开心
We had so much fun last night.

1673
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:06,820
我就是贝利

What a great night.

1675
01:29:08,190 --> 01:29:09,010

你很棒
You were amazing.

1677
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:12,140
是的 你也很棒

1678
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:17,750
- 等等 贝利以前不就是这样吗  - 是啊
- Wait, didn't Bailey used to do that?  - Yeah.

1679
01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:19,280
狗狗都会这样做
It's a dog thing.

1680
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:23,740
贝利 我是贝利
Bailey. I'm Bailey.

1681
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:26,780
肯定有办法的
There's gotta be a way.

1682
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:35,310
等等
Hmm. Wait.

1683
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:39,190
这味道有点熟悉
That's familiar.

1684
01:29:58,380 --> 01:30:01,110
我闻到了…我的味道
I smelled... me.

1685
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:09,420
你叼着什么呢
What do you got there?

1686
01:30:11,660 --> 01:30:13,690
你在哪发现的
Where did you find that?

1687
01:30:22,990 --> 01:30:23,830
你想玩吗
You want to play?

1688
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:26,470
准备好
Get ready.

1689
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:28,530
你得追着这个
You have to really go after this one.

1690
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:31,790
去追吧
Go get it.

1691
01:30:32,630 --> 01:30:33,450

1692
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:35,560
来 把它带回来
