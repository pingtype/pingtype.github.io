地下拳击场

3
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,470
我对人与神都有罪
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I have sinned against both man and God.

4
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,150
我在比地狱还阴暗的地牢中待了十年
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I've spent ten years in a hole darker than hell.

5
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,910
一直在等待着
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Waiting.. always waiting.

6
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,231
尽管我一直不明白这样生活的意义
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I still do not know what this life is for.

7
00:00:51,349 --> 00:00:53,751
也不明白我们选择如此生活的原因
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Or why it's been given to us.

8
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,575
但我知道有人已经完成了我所追求的目标
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}And I know that a man has done what I've done..

9
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,872
尽管不值得去梦想
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Does not deserve to dream.

10
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,033
但我依然在完成
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}But I still do.

11
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,710
加油 博伊卡
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- Come on Boyka. - Boyka, Boyka!

12
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,310

13

准备好了吗  准备好了吗
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Are you ready? Are you ready?

17
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:06,766
开始
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Fight!

18
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,348
谢谢你 又是如此慷慨的捐赠
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Another generous donation. Thank you.

19
00:05:16,636 --> 00:05:17,903
这是我的荣幸
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}It is my pleasure.

20
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,390
你昨晚有没有赢得比赛  - 是的 我赢了 神父
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- Did you win your last fight? - Yes, father, I did.

21
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:29,436
尤里 我们都很感激你一直以来的捐赠
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Yuri... we are very grateful for all your donations

22
00:05:29,636 --> 00:05:31,092
这些捐赠帮助我们建造了这个教堂
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}that help us build this church.

23
00:05:33,147 --> 00:05:36,679
但如果你在自我救赎 暴力对你来说不是正确的途径
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}If it is salvation is you seek violence is not the answer.

24
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:40,808
但是我告诉过你 这只是一项运动 我们都得遵守游戏规则
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}But I told you. It's a sport. We have rules.

25
00:05:41,193 --> 00:05:43,230
但你觉得上帝会接受
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Even if you do have rules...

26
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:48,750
你的所作所为吗? 我觉得这是上帝赐予我的礼物
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Do you think God approves of what you do?  - I think God gave me this gift.

27
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,350
如果我放弃了它 便是亵渎
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}And I think it would be a sin to waste it.

28
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:55,733
暴力会吞噬一个好人
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Violence has a way of consuming men.

29
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,863
一旦被暴力吞噬
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Then it is hard to see what good you can do..

30
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:01,954
人就会因此堕落
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}When you are surrounded by that.

31
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,510

下场比赛会来一位非常有实力的新拳手
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I convinced the tournament scouts to come and watch you at your next fight.

40
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,350
如果你能说服他们，你就能参赛
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}If you convince them, then you're in!

41
00:06:36,865 --> 00:06:39,150
真的这么简单 - 没错
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- That's it? - Yes.

42
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,310
好极了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Very good!

54
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,470
我的对手都很厉害 最后还不是失败
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}They are all good. It does not matter.

55
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,670

我们很久没见到过像你这么优秀的拳手了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}It's been a while since we have seen such an impressive fighter.

75
00:12:09,707 --> 00:12:11,953
博伊卡 两周之后
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Boyka, two weeks.

76
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,270

00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:24,230
如果你赢了 你就有资格进入大联盟 你要是输了 那就会失去一切
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}You win, and you're in the big league. You lose, and it's over.

79
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,630
我不会输 咱们到时候见
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I don't lose, I'll be there.

80
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,404
好 那到时候见
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Good. We'll see you there.

81
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:37,340
博伊卡 你这辈子就是为此而战 现在机会终于来了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Pretty great no? This is what you've been fighting for your whole life Boyka. Now it's here.

82
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,430
这是你今晚比赛的奖金
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Your winnings from tonight's fight.

83
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,720
他怎么样了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}What is the matter him?

84
00:13:01,035 --> 00:13:03,948
他现在情况很不好 我们要马上送他去医院
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}He is in very serious condition, we are taking him to the hospital.

85
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:08,150
也许是脑震荡
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}It looks like a concussion.

86
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,193
但你觉得上帝会接受你的所作所为吗
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Do you think God approves what you do?

87
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,550
我觉得这是上帝赐予我的礼物 如果我放弃了 便是亵渎
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}God gave me this gift. And it would be a shame to waste it.

88
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,670
给我滚出去
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Get the fuck out.

89
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,230
- 什么事 博伊卡  - 昨天和我比赛的拳手
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- What is it Boyka? - The man that I fought last night.

90
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,637
昨天被送到医院里了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}They took him to the hospital.

91
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:30,953
他现在怎么样了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}How is he doing?

92
00:14:31,153 --> 00:14:33,026
你已经赢了 还在乎那个干什么
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}You won. What does it matter, how's he doing?

93
00:14:33,226 --> 00:14:34,803
回答我的问题
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Just answer the fucking question.

94
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,511
他死了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}He is dead.

95
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,995
你这是什么意思
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}What do you mean he's dead?

96
00:14:43,191 --> 00:14:46,585
这不是你的错 这是意外。你不用为此负责
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Don't worry though. It was an accident. You are not liable for his death.

97
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:50,550
这是每个拳手必将承担的风险
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}It's a risk every fighter takes Boyka.

98
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,030
他叫什么名字  - 维克多
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- What was his name? - Viktor.

99
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,990
维克多
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Viktor...

100
00:15:01,423 --> 00:15:02,567
他是哪里的人
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}where did he come from?

101
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:07,230
他是俄国人 来自多宁 只是一个拳手而已
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}He is a Russian from Drovny. He is just another fighter.

102
00:15:08,187 --> 00:15:12,551
他有家人吗 有没有妻子和孩子
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}What about his family? Did he have a wife? Children?

103
00:15:12,697 --> 00:15:14,515
我不清楚 我已经清理了他的更衣柜
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}How should I know? I cleaned out his locker.

104
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,265
博伊卡 别再纠结了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Forget about him Boyka.

105
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:20,630
给我看看他的行李
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}His things from the locker, I want to see them.

106
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,853
都在这个包里了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Here, I got his bag.

107
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,977
我已经检查过了 没有现金
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}He doesn't have any cash, I already checked.

108
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:51,788
我需要一本假护照 我要穿过俄罗斯边境
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- I need a fake passport. - A fake passport for what? To cross the border.

109
00:15:51,988 --> 00:15:55,894
可俄罗斯警方现在还在通缉你
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I'm going to Russia. - Russia, Are you crazy? You are a wanted man there.

110
00:15:56,002 --> 00:15:58,709
你就让我来解决吧  - 那布达佩斯呢？
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- Let me worry about that. - And what about Budapest?

111
00:15:58,808 --> 00:16:00,631
两周之后就要开赛了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Your dream? It's in less than 2 weeks.

112
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:05,190
你把护照帮我做好就行了 - 不行 你这是在犯错
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- You give me the fucking passport or not? - I can't. It's a mistake.

113
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,510
你给还是不给
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}You get me the fucking passport.

114
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,110
当然 我会帮你做
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Okay. Okay.

115
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:20,390
但我必须警告你
这可能会毁了你这一辈子 博伊卡
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}But I must warn you. This can ruin your life Boyka.

116
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:26,950
我不在乎
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}It's not this life I'm worried about.

117
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:33,350
多宁 俄罗斯

118
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:11,707
节哀顺变 - 谢谢
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- My condolences. - Thank you.

119
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,590
谢谢你们

120
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,782
他是个好人 是个好拳手
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}He was a good man and a good fighter.

121
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:24,812
{\1c&HC4EBF7&}Yes.

122
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:31,910
你现在要怎么做  - 我从16岁起就和他在一块了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- What will you do now? - We have been together since I was 16.

123
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:37,670
我不知道该做什么 - 我说的不是这个
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- I don't know anything else. - But this is not what I'm talking about.

124
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:46,230
这是我丈夫的葬礼 - 他已经死了 死人还有什么意义
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- This is my husband's funeral. - He is dead. What does it matter now?

125
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:50,990
你现在可欠我很多钱呢
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Except for the fact that you owe me, a lot of money.

126
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,430
我会为你工作偿还债务
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I will work for you to pay off the loan.

127
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,350
我赚的每个子都是你的 - 不如让我来帮你
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- You will get every ruble. - Let me help.

128
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:05,990
我会让你减轻一些负担
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I can make things easier for you.

129
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,790
护照做好了吗？ - 你来晚了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- You get the passport? - You are late.

130
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,520
作为你的经纪人 我还是劝你…
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}As your manager, I advice you not to do this.

131
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,060
少废话
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Just give me the fucking thing.

132
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,030
我阻止不了你  可我有一言还请你静听
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Boyka, if I can't stop you, then, at least listen to me.

133
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,088
现在你习惯了自由的生活
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}You've gotten used to the outside,

134
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:49,463
所以回家路上要小心
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}You're going to have to be very careful going back.

135
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,240
不要乘坐公交大巴
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Stay away from commercial buses.

136
00:19:52,395 --> 00:19:55,891
大巴会载你去公交枢纽 那里都被严密监管着
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Those will only take you to major border crossing with tight controls.

137
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,875
你最好坐当地的迷你巴士
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Best bet is to get on a local minivan..

138
00:19:58,975 --> 00:20:02,743
那些车会带你去军方的临时关卡
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Assuming which will drive you across a provisional military checkpoint.

139
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:07,438
那里的士兵没有网络
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}The soldiers there, they have no internet access.

140
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:10,195
整体也比较松散
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}And generally they're relaxed and uninterested.

141
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,111
通过的时候保持低调 这样你才不会卷入麻烦当中
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}You keep your head down, and your nose clean..

142
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:18,710
一旦你进入俄罗斯 我就只能祝你好运了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}And you should get through without any trouble. After that you're on your own.

143
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,110
拿出你们的护照来
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Visas, passports, get them out..

144
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,630
都把护照准备好 你们配合工作才能快点结束
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Have your papers ready. Nobody wants to wait on you.

145
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,630
你叫什么名字
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}What's your name?

146
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,950
安东・拉格诺夫  - 你来乌克兰做什么
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- Anton Lagunov. - What were you doing in Ukraine?

147
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,090
我来看我叔叔
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Visiting my uncle.

148
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,121
他快不行了 你还有问题吗
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}He is dying. Is there a problem?

149
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,630
没问题  拿出护照来
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}No, no problem. Papers.

150
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,030
放行

151
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:13,470
多宁 俄罗斯

152
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,270
你有事吗
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Can I help you?

153
00:24:30,043 --> 00:24:31,458
我要和那个女的谈谈
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I wanted to speak with her.

154
00:24:31,658 --> 00:24:35,670
没人可以和她谈  - 他们去哪?
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- Nobody speaks to her. - Where are they going?

155
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,150
她要去工作   - 在哪儿
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- She's going to work now. - Where?

156
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:45,753
来啊
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Come on!

157
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:22,070
伊戈尔 伊戈尔 伊戈尔
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Igor, Igor!

158
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:40,390
今晚的冠军 依然是我们打不倒的
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}And the winner by TKO and still undefeated.

159
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,630
地下收割者 伊戈尔
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Our underground killer, Igor!

160
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:04,270
这是我的赛场 混账们
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}This is my ring, you motherfuckers!

161
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,510
你们有意见吗
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}What was going to happen?

162
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:10,150
这是我的赛场
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}This is my ring!

163
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,710
你是谁 为什么跟踪我
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Who are you? Are you following me?

164
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:59,350
不 我只是想和你谈谈
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}No. I need to talk to you.

165
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:01,170
什么事 我还在工作
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}About what? I am working.

166
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:07,470
求你了 我从大老远跑来 就是想和你谈谈
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}No, please. I'm sorry... I come very long way to talk to you.

167
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:17,350
你想干什么
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}What do you think you're doing?

168
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,910
继续工作
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Get back to work.

169
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:26,510
你最好跟我来
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Why don't you come with me?

170
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,638
我只是想和她谈谈
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I just want to talk to her.

171
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:38,270
我们外面谈
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Come on. We'll talk outside.

172
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:10,390
你找错人了 回家吧  给我几分钟就行
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- You choose the wrong girl. Go home. - Look, I only need a few minutes with her.

173
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:13,310
她是老板的人 谁也不能碰她
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}She belongs to the boss. So fuck off.

174
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,910
她什么时候下班
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}So, what time does she finish work?

175
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:24,950
你是聋子吗
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Are you deaf?

176
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:25,790
给他点颜色瞧瞧
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Fuck this asshole up.

177
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,030
完美
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Bravo.

178
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:03,150
完美的表演
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Bravo. That was quite a show you put on.

179
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,324
我叫佐拉 这里是我开的
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}My name is Zourab. And this is my club.

180
00:30:07,329 --> 00:30:08,446
你这身手应该帮我
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}You should fight for me.

181
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:12,430
在这打拳才对  - 我不感兴趣
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Here, in my ring. - Not interested.

182
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:16,470
我来不是为了帮你比赛的  - 那你为什么要来
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Didn't come here for that.  - Why did you come then?

183
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:25,150
我来是找那个女服务生说几句话
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}The girl. The waitress. I need to tell her something.

184
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,590
奥玛
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Alma.

185
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:35,350
不管你要和她说什么 告诉我
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Well, whatever it is you want to tell her, you can tell me,

186
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:40,470
- 我帮你传达   - 不用 我自己去
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- I'll make sure that she gets the message. - No I give her the message myself.

187
00:30:40,725 --> 00:30:45,630
没有我的允许 谁也不能接近她 她是我的
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Nobody goes near Alma without my permission. I own her.

188
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:51,030
连这个城都是我的  如果你再去找她一次
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I own this city. You try to talk to her one more time...

189
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:56,630
我就杀了你 别再让我看见你
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I'll fucking kill you. Now get the hell out of my face.

190
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,670
快走
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Go on.

191
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,550
盯紧他
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Keep an eye on him.

192
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:18,870
我是全世界最一流的拳手
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I am the most complete fighter in the world.

193
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:28,350
上帝会接受你的所作所为吗
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Do you think God approves for what you do?

194
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,990
你以为想进就能进吗  站住
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Hey. Where do you think you're going?  Hold it.

195
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:31,470
又是你 你想干什么
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}You again... what is it?

196
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,670
我只想过来告诉你
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I came here today to tell you that...

197
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:48,750
我认识你丈夫 维克多  节哀顺变
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I knew your husband, Victor. I'm sorry for your loss.

198
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:58,350
谢谢 麻烦你这么大老远来看我
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Thank you. It's a very nice of you to come.

199
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:03,230
你老板 佐拉  有没有给你找麻烦
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Your boss, Zourab... Does he bother you?

200
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,990
没有
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}No.

201
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:12,510
因为他借给我们的钱 我们才能经营这个体育中心
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}He gave Viktor and me a loan, so we could open this community center.

202
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:16,070
现在我得为他工作才能还债
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I work just for him to pay off the debt.

203
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:21,670
你是在哪里见到维克多的
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}So, where did you meet Viktor?

204
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,630
你也是拳手吗  - 是的
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- Are you a fighter too? - Yes, I'm a fighter.

205
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:31,630
我在基辅见到了他  你有没有看他最后一场比赛
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- I met him in Kiev. - Then did you see his last fight?

206
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:38,230
是我做的
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}It was me.

207
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:44,750
当时在基辅和他比赛的人就是我
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I was the one in the ring. In Kiev. It was an accident.

208
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:51,110
我只是想告诉你那是个意外  我能为你做些什么
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I wanted to come here tell you that... If there is anything I can do..

209
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:56,830
你能 你确实可以帮我做些事情
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Yes, yes, there is something you can do.

210
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:02,870
把他还给我 你能做到吗
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Bring him back. Can you do this?

211
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:09,270
不能
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}No.

212
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:16,310
这是我那场比赛的奖金 你拿着
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}This is the money from the fight. I think you should have it.

213
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:18,070
这钱占满了我丈夫的血
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}This is blood money.

214
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:24,350
你就是为了这些钱才夺走我丈夫的性命吧
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}So that's why you took my husband's life. You murderer.

215
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:27,950
你还是自己留着享福吧 快走
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Take these back and get the hell out of here.

216
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:32,750
回到基辅 从哪来的回哪去 快走
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Back yo Kiev, or whatever it is, that you came from. Get out.

217
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:08,270
这些人还只是孩子 你这是在浪费我的时间
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}These are children in front of It's a waste of my fucking time.

218
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:11,363
奥莱克招了一个北方来的家伙
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Olegs, just some new guy down from the north,

219
00:35:11,393 --> 00:35:13,310
他想让我们去会会他
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}He says we have to see him.

220
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:17,950
他的人都是弱鸡 我需要真正的拳手
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Oleg's guys are Minos. I need fucking sharks.

221
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:23,270
我们现在能找到的就这些人 你到底想要什么
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}This is what is available, Zourab. What do you want?

222
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,910
我想要什么
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}What do I Want?

223
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:34,550
我想要那种非凡的拳手 会战斗 会比赛
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I want someone to impress me Slava. I want someone who knows how to hit. And someone who knows how to get hit.

224
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,956
而不是像他们有一样 整天只会打沙袋
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Not these fucking bums you bring me from the streets.

225
00:35:36,986 --> 00:35:38,910
这些打街拳的除了白吃饭什么都不会做
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Who are merely piece of meat with a pulse.

226
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:46,870
你现在知道我想要什么了吧  找个让我服气的拳手
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Slava, What I want, I want to be fucking entertained!

227
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,110
等等
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Wait a minute.

228
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:01,390
我不是让你离开这里吗  - 你的屁话我才不会在乎
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- Thought I told you to leave this town? - I don't give a shit you said.

229
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:10,390
那我的建议你考虑的怎么样了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Do you reconsider my offer?

230
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:14,670
奥玛 她欠你多少钱
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}How much does she owe you? Who, Alma.

231
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:18,150
这不关你的事  - 这现在就是我的事
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- It is none of your fucking business. - Well, I'm making it my fucking business.

232
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:21,790
你肯定付不起
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}She owes me more than you can ever possibly pay.

233
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:26,230
那咱们来做个交易
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Well, then I want to make a deal..

234
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:30,150
你放过她 我就为你比赛
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I fight for you, you wipe her debt.

235
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:48,470
六场比赛 - 两场
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- Six fights. - Deal.

236
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:52,190
三场
那到时候我们互不相欠
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- Three fights. - And then she owes you nothing.

237
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:56,470
我只有一个条件 你要打败这里最强的拳手
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}One condition. You have to beat my champion.

238
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:01,750
你最好小心点 我会做掉你的
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Watch out I'm going to fuck you up..

239
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:07,030
这个家伙我要最后一个收拾  - 好
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- Just make sure you save this cunt to last. - Good.

240
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:10,550
明天就开始 比赛之间给我一天晚上休息的时间
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}We start tomorrow. A night's rest in between each.

241
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:14,190
一周三场比赛 你只要要输了一场…
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Three fights a week. You really want to loose..

242
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:17,470
不会 我会速战速决
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}No. Just in a hurry.

243
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,790
有什么地方能让我训练
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}You have a place I can train?

244
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:24,717
有 五个街区外有个体育馆
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Sure there is a gym five blocks east of here.

245
00:37:24,747 --> 00:37:26,430
斯雷瓦会带你去
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Slava here will show you.

246
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:35,790
还有最后一件事 和你做买卖非常愉快 尤里・博伊卡先生
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}One last thing. It's really nice to do business with you, Yuri Boyka.

247
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:39,550
很惊讶吧？ 我操持着这个镇
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Oh, you surprised? I told you that it is my town.

248
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:44,470
有什么事是我不知道的 你不用担心警察找你麻烦
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I know everything that comes to here. But don't worry about the police.

249
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:49,350
连他们都得向我汇报工作 你要记住一件事
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}They report to me. Just remember one thing.

250
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:53,350
我的地盘 要按我的规矩办事
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}My arena, my rules.

251
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,396
你不是告诉过我 不去找打街拳的吗
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}What are you doing? Someone bum off the street?

252
00:38:02,426 --> 00:38:04,550
斯雷瓦 这可不是打街拳的
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}This is no bum off the street, Slava!

253
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:11,870
他来头大得很  什么来头
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Don't you know a legend when he's punching you in the face? Him, what legend!

254
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:16,550
斯雷瓦 你不知道尤里・博伊卡吗
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Slava... Don't you know who Yuri Boyka is?

255
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,830
博伊卡  我暂时还不能回去
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- Boyka? - I have to stay longer.

256
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:31,590
你要待多久？ 一个星期左右  - 什么叫一个星期
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- Longer? What do you mean? How much longer? - Maybe a week. What do you mean a week?

257
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,489
你已经等了这么久 付出了什么？
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Do you how long you've waited? How much you've bled for this moment?

258
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:37,590
投入了这么多训练和金钱 你知不知道你在做什么
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}How much money you spent to fix your knee? Do you know what you're doing?

259
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:42,190
你只要改订车票就行了 到时候我会去的
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Just change the fucking bus ticket. I'll be there.

260
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,830
我没叫你帮我  - 我想帮你
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- I didn't ask you to fight for me. - I just want to help you.

261
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:10,790
我不想要你的钱还有你的帮助 你走就可以了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I don't want your help, I don't want your money. I just want you to leave me alone.

262
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:15,990
只要比赛一结束 我马上就走
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I'll leave you alone as soon as I finish the fights.

263
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:19,259
至少让我偿还我对你和你丈夫欠下的债
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}It's the least I can do for you and your husband.

264
00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:20,590
你想从我这里得到什么
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}What do you want from me?

265
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:26,110
- 我什么都不求  - 你以为我是奖品吗？
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- I don't want anything from you. - Do you think I'm for sale?

266
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:30,430
- 赢了比赛我就是你的吗？  - 我没这个意思
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- Someone can just win over in a fight? - I'm not fighting to own you.

267
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:35,310
只要债务还清 你就能重归自由
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I'm fighting to pay your debts. So you can be free.

268
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:40,750
所以你跑这么大老远就是为了救我吗
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}So you came all this way to save me?

269
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:48,310
我是为自己的救赎而来
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I come here to save myself.

270
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:54,430
奥玛 回到车上 该走了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Alma, get back in the car. It's time to go.

271
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:01,470
干什么？  - 你不许用我的沙袋
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- What? - This is my fucking bag.

272
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,630
我一会就打完
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}It won't be long.

273
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:10,110
这是我的沙袋
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I don't want you using it.

274
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,350
Hey!

275
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,190
该你上场了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}It's time.

276
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:40,950
我们今晚迎来了新拳手 不要再吝惜你们手中的钞票
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}We have a new cover tonight, ladies and gentlemen. So place your bets.

277
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:47,710
红色角落出场的就是 尤里・博伊卡
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}In the red corner, a fierce contender. Yuri Boyka!

278
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:03,870
蓝色角落是来自我们小镇的拳手
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}In the blue corner a local boxer.

279
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:10,230
他的拳速极快还能置人于死地  他就是鲍里斯・塔索夫
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}He is quick. He is deadly. He is Boris Tarsov!

280
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,470
开始
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Fight!

281
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:21,670
你也就逞一时威风 尤里・博伊卡
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}You can have your fun for now, Yuri Boyka.

282
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:25,550
你记住了 我才是这个赛场的主宰
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}But just remember, this is my ring.

283
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:33,390
和我预期的一样精彩 但别懈怠了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Well done. Nothing less than I expected. But don't get too comfortable.

284
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,790
第一关永远不会很难
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}First one is always easy.

285
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:43,510
给我们的赢家送杯水
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Why don't you get our winner here a drink?

286
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,910
给你
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Here..

287
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:09,470
你现在一定很渴  -谢谢
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- You must be thirsty. - Thank you.

288
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:18,350
你知道这里有我能训练的地方吗
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- You know a place where I can train? - Yes.

289
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:20,309
街上有一家体育馆
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}There is a gym down the street.

290
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:23,310
我去过了 里面的人都不是什么好东西
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}No that's place, it's covered down with rats.

291
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:33,990
跟我来体育中心 你可以在那训练
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Come to the community center tomorrow. You can use the one there.

292
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:43,590
我现在给你老板干活 你还跟我过不去
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I am fighting for your boss now. You're going to try stop me again?

293
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:55,870
地方不大 如果你喜欢你可以用
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}It's not much. But if you like it, you can use it.

294
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,710
很好
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Very good.

295
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:30,150
别打扰他 他在训练
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Hey stop bothering the man. Let him work.

296
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:34,670
没关系 让他们看吧
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}It's fine. It's okay. Let them stay.

297
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:01,190
你需要什么吗？  - 我只是来接水的
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- Do you need something?  - Just needed water.

298
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:08,780
我训练是不是影响当你工作了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}It's not bothering you there, the training?

299
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:10,310
没关系 我习惯了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}No. I've missed it.

300
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:16,390
之前维克多一直在那训练 不分昼夜
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Viktor never stopped training. Day or night.

301
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:30,510
女士们先生们 睁大你们的双眼
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Ladies and gentlemen. Double your bets!

302
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:37,230
我们今晚安排了特别节目 让我们欢迎奥泽洛夫兄弟
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Because we have something special for you tonight. The Ozerov brothers!

303
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:44,710
没错 女士们先生们 今晚的比赛是二对一
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}That's right, that's right. Ladies and gentlemen. Two against one.

304
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:47,230
带给你双重快感
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Provides the fun!

305
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:57,590
我之前告诉你了 博伊卡 我的地盘 按我的规矩办事
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Remember, Boyka! My arena, my rules.

306
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:00,630
让我看看你的本事吧
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Now, let's see what you can do.

307
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:17,230
开始
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Fight!

308
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:29,070
我希望你已经准备好了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I hope you're ready.

309
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:32,750
我会把他打成筛子
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I've kicked their shit lot worse.

310
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:37,710
博伊卡
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Boyka, Boyka!

311
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:45,830
今晚二对一比赛的冠军就是 博伊卡・尤里
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}And the winner by double knockout... Yuri Boyka!

312
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:13,470
克里奇夫 我的朋友
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Kojtjev, my friend. Here..

313
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:19,550
去把那些嘴巴漏风的人除掉
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Get rid of those who can't keep their mouth shut.

314
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:34,150
剩下的钱呢 是来干什么的 是我的一点小建议
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- And the other stake, what's that for? - Proposition.

315
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:39,550
把克什玛尔送过来  - 克什玛尔 绰号叫梦魇的那个人？
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- I want you to get me Koshmar. - Koshmar the nightmare?

316
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,150
就是他
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I want him here.

317
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:51,870
不可能 我不可能把他送出监狱
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}It's impossible. I can't get him out of prison anymore.

318
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:56,550
上次我差点连饭碗都丢了  - 你可以做到
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Last time almost cost me my job. - Yes you can.

319
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:03,830
不仅这些钱是你的 你还有奖品可以拿
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}You're not gonna just make more money. There is a bonus.

320
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:07,310
之前越狱的尤里・博伊卡 我可以送还给你
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}When I give you an escaped convict. Yuri Boyka.

321
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:12,390
我的丈夫也习惯在赛后训练
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}My husband used to train after matches too.

322
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:16,590
他说在肌肉酸痛的时候训练是最好的
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}He said that it was best time when the muscles still hurt.

323
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:23,950
拿着 这个东西可以治你的腰伤
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Here, ointment for your back..

324
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,750
这是我祖母的祖传药
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}My grandmother's recipe.

325
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:56,430
给我吧 没事 我自己来 把它给我
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Give it to me. It's fine I.. It's okay. Give it to me..

326
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:58,910
做下
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Sit down.

327
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:34,830
你没必要这么为我拼命
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}You do not have to fight for me.

328
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:38,430
你随时都可以离开这个小镇
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- You can leave this town anytime you want.

329
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:40,110
为什么你不选择离开
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Why do not you leave here?

330
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:44,830
你只要带上你需要的东西 离开这里就好
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Just take what you need, and get the hell out.

331
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:48,550
离开
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}To leave?

332
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:52,110
这个地方就是我们的梦想 就是这个中心
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}This place was our dream. This centrer...

333
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:55,230
这里的孩子们知道我们不会抛弃他们
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}The kids here know, I will never abandon them.

334
00:54:55,310 --> 00:55:01,510
如果没有这个地方 事情只会变得更糟
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Without a place like this, all of this kids will be in gangs or something worse.

335
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:05,150
你什么都不知道
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}But you probably won't know anything about it.

336
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:08,590
剩下的你自己拿着
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}You can keep the rest.

337
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:37,613
斯雷瓦 你有没有盯着博伊卡
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Slava. Did your men watch Boyka?

338
00:55:37,643 --> 00:55:41,190
有 我一直盯着他不放 他一直在那
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Yes. Just like you said, for the whole time that he was there.

339
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:41,578
还有呢
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}And?

340
00:55:41,608 --> 00:55:45,990
他每天训练两个小时 就离开了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}He just trains. That's it. Two hours. Then he leaves.

341
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:51,470
奥玛呢 她也没什么  - 她一直忙自己的 不和他说话
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- And she? What was she doing? - Nothing. She does not even talk to him.

342
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:53,990
连看都不怎么看他
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}She can barely even look at him.

343
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:12,470
你工作的太频繁了  - 我没得选择
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- You work too hard. - I don't have a choice.

344
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:19,990
请你不要碰我  - 为什么？
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- Please don't to touch me. - Why?

345
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:26,630
因为博伊卡吗？ 他在这待的时间太久了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Is it because of Boyka? I hear that he spends time here, too much time.

346
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:29,510
他只是需要一个地方训练而已
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}He just needs a place to train.

347
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:35,270
他是头野兽 一个冷血杀手 就是他杀了你的丈夫
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}He's an animal. A cold-blooded killer. The man that murdered your husband.

348
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:44,670
那是个意外 你真的相信吗？
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}That was an accident. Was it truly an accident?

349
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:49,510
就是他一拳一拳的打到你丈夫的脸上
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}When his fists pounded into your husband's skull.

350
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:53,750
一拳又一拳的打  - 你不要再说了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- Over and over and over. - Please, stop it.

351
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:58,950
事情不是你想的那样
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}It is not how it happened.

352
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:01,670
你已经和他上过床了吧
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}You fucking him, aren't you?

353
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:05,950
你怎么能这么说
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}How dare you?

354
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:10,070
你知道我多爱维克多 你马上给我离开
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}You know how much I loved Viktor. I want you to leave right now.

355
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:12,790
{\1c&HC4EBF7&}No.

356
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:15,510
求你放过我
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Please let go off me.

357
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:22,830
他不应该来到这里 别再让他来 不然我杀了他
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}He is not allowed here. I'll fucking kill him, if you let him back in.

358
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:51,024
基里尔
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Kiril?

359
00:57:51,054 --> 00:57:55,190
博伊卡 体育馆里现在挤满了想要见你的粉丝
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Boyka, the arena is already crawling with fans waiting to see you.

360
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:59,630
你的大名都登在了报纸和海报上
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Your name has been published in all the newspaper and billboards.

361
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:03,350
别忘了今晚的公交车 9:45 出发
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Don't forget, your bus is at 9:45 pm tonight.

362
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:06,159
别来玩了 媒体有很多事情要问你
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Don't be late. The press is waiting to talk to you.

363
00:58:06,189 --> 00:58:07,990
我会到的 别担心
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Don't worry I will be there.

364
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:24,990
你在这干什么
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}What are you doing here?

365
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:30,990
有关你和我丈夫的拳赛 你告诉我他是怎么死的
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}The fight with my husband. Can you tell me what happened?

366
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:35,670
现在最好不要说这件事
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I think it's better if we don't talk about it.

367
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:40,430
为什么？ 你是不是在隐瞒什么？
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Why? Do you have something to hide?

368
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:45,550
我不想伤害你  - 没关系 我能接受
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- I just don't want to hurt you. - I can take it.

369
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:53,270
看着我的眼睛 把真相告诉我
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Look into my eyes and tell me the truth.

370
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:56,430
这究竟是不是意外
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Was it really an accident?

371
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:04,750
我已经犯过了这样的错误 奥玛
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I've done things in this life, Alma. Terrible things.

372
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:08,830
这个错误已经让我在监狱里待了很长时间
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Things that put me in the prison for a long time.

373
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:15,150
我是个充满了仇恨 痛苦 又愤怒的人
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I was a bitter, angry man, full of hate.

374
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:19,110
直到上帝给我指明道路 我看到希望
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Until God showed me the path.

375
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:24,430
我已经走过了几百里
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I've had hundreds of fights. Hundreds.

376
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:29,510
从最黑暗的拳击场到监狱里
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}In the shittiest of arenas to the darkest deepest hellhole prisons...

377
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:31,523
最邪恶的地狱
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}you could possibly imagine.

378
00:59:31,553 --> 00:59:34,990
但我一直没抛下上帝赐予我的礼物
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}But I never lost sight of the gift God gave me.

379
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:41,030
直到有一天
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}And then one day...

380
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:46,230
上帝为我打开了大门 给我机会
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}God, he opened up the doors to me and gave me the chance

381
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:49,710
让我向全世界证明自己
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}to prove myself to the world.

382
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:54,030
他想考验我 我不想让他失望
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}He was testing me, and I was not going to disappoint him.

383
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:57,190
可是
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}And so...

384
00:59:57,270 --> 01:00:01,990
我和维克多对打的时候
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}In the ring. With Viktor.

385
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:06,150
我看到的不是一个人
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I did not see a man.

386
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:09,910
不是一位丈夫
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I did not see a husband.

387
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:14,550
是阻挡在我和我的梦想之间的障碍
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Only someone standing in between me and my dream.

388
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:21,710
可我没想杀死他
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}But I did not mean to kill him.

389

407
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:44,150
我要去赶公交车 一切都结束了 她现在自由了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I have a bust to catch. It's over. She is free.

408
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:47,270
什么叫结束了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}What's over?

409
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:51,350
我们有言在先
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}We had a deal.

410
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:54,790
是的 三场比赛 并且要赢这里最好的拳手
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Yes. The deal was three fights and you have to beat my champion.

411
01:06:56,550 --> 01:07:00,230
那伊戈尔算什么
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}What does that fucking Igor look like to you?

412
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:03,550
他可不是这里最好的 他不过是个三流货色
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Who? This guy? He is not my champion. He was your third fight.

413
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:07,510
现在你得挑战这里最好的拳手 别再扯淡了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Now you have to defeat my champion. This is fucking bullshit.

414
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:14,630
我不会再比赛了  - 你会的 博伊卡
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- I am not fighting for you anymore. - Yes you are Boyka.

415
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:18,990
你不打 交易终止
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Cause if you don't, then we don't have a deal.

416
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:24,310
难道你不想就她吗
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Don't you want to save her?

417
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:26,490
你可以成为她的大英雄
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Don't you want to be her hero?

418
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:29,670
如果你现在走掉 她还是要还债
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}You walk away now, and her debt still remains.

419
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:33,270
给我打 不然我就像卖垃圾一样卖掉她
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Unless you want me to sell her like a piece of meat, you're going to fight.

420
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:40,750
如果你输了 那一切都结束了她就是我的
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}And after my champion crushes your skull. You and I will be done, and the girl will be mine.

421
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:56,470
你到车站了吗
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Are you already at the bus station?

422
01:07:56,550 --> 01:07:59,910
我还走不了  - 什么意思
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- I can not leave yet. - Are you crazy? What is wrong with you?

423
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:03,830
你的车十五分钟之后就出发了   -  最后一班车是哪个
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- Your bus leaves in 15 minutes. - What time is the last bus?

424
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:07,990
K1号 22点出发 如果你错过这班车 你会错过整场比赛的
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}10 pm. If you miss it, you won't get your flight to Budapest.

425
01:08:08,070 --> 01:08:11,190
我会准时到的
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I won't miss it.

426
01:08:13,790 --> 01:08:17,150

{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}So what are we waiting for?

427
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:19,750

428
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:26,030

{\1c&HC4EBF7&}No!

436
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:43,310
你给不了我想要的 那这就是你的下场
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}This is what happens when you don't give me what I want.

437
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:49,070
你竟然选择一头野兽 一个杀人犯
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}You choose a murderer. An animal!

438
01:15:00,990 --> 01:15:02,793
我说的还不清楚吗

443
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:19,190

445
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:27,750
你只不过是个逃犯 博伊卡 你能给她什么？
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}You're an escaped convict, Boyka. What can you possibly give her?

446
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:32,910
你只是个可悲的拳手罢了 就像她死了的老公一样
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}You are a fucking washed up to beat fighter just like her fucking dead husband.

447
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:17,990
你受伤了 我得把你送到医院去
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}You're hurt. We have to get you to a doctor.

448
01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:22,390

449
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:28,110
那天你问我 我想从你身上得到些什么
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}The day you came to see me, you asked me what it was I wanted from you.

450
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:31,990
我不知道怎么回答
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I did not know how to say it at that time...

451
01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:36,310
可我只想求得你的原谅
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}But I needed to ask you for your forgiveness.

452

你能不能原谅我
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}Can you forgive me?

456
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:24,670

{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I'm fine. I did not expect to see you.

462
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:38,950
孩子们还好吗？ - 他们很好
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}- How are the kids? - They are doing great.

463
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:43,430
这是他们为你画的画
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}They drew these pictures for you.

464
01:19:56,790 --> 01:20:01,550
抱歉 我本来能早点过来看你的 可是我来不了
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I'm sorry. I wanted to come visit earlier, but I couldn't.

465
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:07,470

466
01:20:09,710 --> 01:20:14,270
我第一次见你的时候 我根本不知道该说什么 做什么
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}When I first saw you, I did not know what to say or do.

467
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:19,110
愤怒使我迷失了自己
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}I was too angry. I was... lost.

468
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:21,529
但是你让我知道
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}But then you showed me something.

469
01:20:21,559 --> 01:20:25,390
这个世界上还是有善意的
{\fscx77\fscy80\1c&HC4EBF7&}You've showed me that there was still good in the world.
