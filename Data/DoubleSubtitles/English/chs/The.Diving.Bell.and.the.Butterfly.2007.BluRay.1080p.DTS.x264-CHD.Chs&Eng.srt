潜水钟与蝴蝶

5
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,330
- 看！他醒了  - 通知科奇东医生，快！
- Look! He's waking.  - Page Dr. Cocheton. Quickly.

6
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,500
科奇东医生请到一一九病房
Dr. Cocheton to room 119, please.

7
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,290
波比先生，睁开眼，请睁开眼睛
Mr. Bauby, open your eyes. Open your eyes.

8
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,200
波比先生，把眼睛睁开
Mr. Bauby, open your eyes.

9
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,540
你已经睡了很久了，现在终于醒过来了，能听到我吗？
You've been asleep for a long time, you're waking up now. Can you hear me?

10
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,080
[是的，我能听到]
[Yes, I'm hearing you.]

11
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,410
[发生了什么？]
[What's happening?]

12
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,040
[天啊，医院]
[Jesus, a hospital.]

13
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,790
波比先生，请把眼睛睁大
Mr. Bauby, open your eyes wide.

14
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,450
尽量把眼睛睁开
Try to keep them open.

15
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,290
对，就这样，眼睛盯着我手里的灯
Yes, like that. Follow this lamp with your eyes.

16
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,080
好的
Alright.

17
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,620
别怕，你现在在医院
Don't be alarmed. You're in a hospital.

18
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,740
我是科奇东医生，他们是护士
I'm a doctor. My name's Cocheton. These are nurses.

19
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,950
我们会好好照顾你的
We're here to take care of you.

20
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,280
还记得都发生了什么吗？
Do you remember what happened?

21
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,120
还记得发生的事情吗？
Do you remember what happened?

22
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,160
[只有一些模糊的片段]
[Just vague images]

23
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:50,410
你现在在加来贝克海滨的海军医院
You're in the Naval Hospital, Berck-sur-Mer. On the coast. At Calais.

24
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,780
先前你在巴黎接受治疗，之后转院到这里
You were treated first in Paris, and then brought here.

25
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,950
这些你都记得吗？
Do you remember that?

26
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,870
吉恩-多米尼克
Jean-Dominique.

27
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,120
你中风了
You've had a stroke.

28
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,450
昏迷了近三个礼拜
You've been in a coma for almost three weeks.

29
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,540
不过现在你醒过来了，一切都会好起来的
But now you're waking up and you'll be fine.

30
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,200
我保证
I promise you.

31
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,620
[谢谢]
[Thank you]

32
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,120
我得给你做些简单测试
I have to give you some simple tests.

33
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,030
眼睛看着我
Keep your eyes on me.

34
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,620
很好
Good.

35
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,030
眼睛跟着我的手指走，好的
Follow my finger. Good.

36
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,240
我说“眨眼”，你就眨眼
When I say blink, please blink.

37
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,700
好极了
Excellent.

38
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,830
好，现在告诉我你的名字
Now, tell me your name.

39
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,780
[吉恩-多米尼克·波比]
[Jean-Dominique Bauby.]

40
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,370
来，努力试下
Come on, try

41
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,620
[我刚不是告诉你了吗]
[I just did.]

42
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,280
努力试下，说出你的名字
Try really hard, say your name.

43
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,580
[吉恩-多米尼克·波比]
[Jean-Dominique Bauby.]

44
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,740
试试说下你孩子的名字
Try saying your children's names.

45
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,830
[西奥菲勒，席莱斯特，霍顿斯]
[Theophile, Celeste, Hortense.]

46
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,240
别着急
Don't worry.

47
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:21,120
虽然缓慢，但你的语言功能会恢复的
It's a slow process. But your speech will come back.

48
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:26,120
[什么？难道你听不到我？医生？医生？]
[What? Can't you hear me, doctor? Doctor?]

49
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,700
[到底是怎么了？我说不了话了]
[What's happening? I can't speak.]

50
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,120
[他们听不到我说话，天啊]
[They can't hear me. Oh my God.]

51
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,240
[我说不了话了]
[I can't speak.]

52
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,740
[我到底是怎么了？]
[What's happened to me?]

53
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,530
[我叫吉恩-多米尼克·波比]
[My name is Jean-Dominique Bauby.]

54
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,780
[医生？]
[Doctor?]

55
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,450
[好吧，好吧]
[All right, all right.]

56
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,200
[我中了风，我的语言和记忆都会恢复的]
[I've had a stroke my speech'll come back my memory will come back]

57
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:57,610
一切都会好起来的，波比先生，我们会好好照顾你的
Everything will be alright, Mr. Bauby. We are here to care for you.

58
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,780
[我会耐心的]
[I'll be patient.]

59
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,030
[好的]
[OK.]

60
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,700
[好的，我相信你们]
[OK, I believe you.]

61
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,610
[这些花是谁送来的？]
[Who brought these flowers?]

62
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,740
[玫瑰花]
[Roses.]

63
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,110
[伊莱斯]
[Elese]

64
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,200
睡得还好吗？
Did you sleep well?

65
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,360
让我来看看
Let's see.

66
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,780
你的神经治疗师莱裴奇医生要来查房
You're going to have an important visitor. Dr. Lepage, your neurologist.

67
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,700
所以希望你好好表现
So we want you at your very best.

68
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,570
早上好
Good morning.

69
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,030
我是神经治疗师，亚伦·莱裴奇医生，相信你已经见过科奇东医生了
I'm Alain Lepage, your neurologist. You know Dr. Cocheton, of course.

70
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,280
吉恩-多米尼克…不，你的朋友都叫你吉多
Jean-Dominique... no, no, your friends call you Jean-Do.

71
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,950
我也会这么称呼你，把我当作你的朋友
So that's what I'm going to call you. Think of me as your friend.

72
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,610
[没问题，医生]
[Sure Doctor.]

73
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,490
作为朋友，我明白眼下对你来说有多困难
As a friend I know how difficult this is for you.

74
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,990
没有人向你说明你的病情
Nobody here has explained to you the full extent of your condition.

75
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:21,530
你的情况，医学界称之为脑血管意外
You've had what we call a cerebrovascular accident.

76
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,530
就是令你的脑干无法正常工作
It's put your brain stem out of action.

77
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:31,780
脑干的作用非常重要
The brain stem is an essential component of our internal computer

78
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,110
它是连接大脑和脊髓的桥梁
the link between the brain and the spinal cord.

79
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,110
要在过去，我们会称你这种情况为严重中风
In the past, we would have said you'd had a massive stroke.

80
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,530
生还几率近乎为零
You would very probably have died.

81
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:47,490
但是现在医学发达
But now we have such improved resuscitation techniques

82
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,860
我们可以延长生命
that we're able to prolong life.

83
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,780
[你就管这叫生命？]
[Is this life?]

84
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,610
[- 这就叫生命？ - 对，延长生命]
[- Is this life?  - Yes, prolong life.]

85
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:03,610
我不会对你隐瞒病情，吉多，你现在全身瘫痪
I'm not going to mince words, Jean-Do. You are completely paralyzed.

86
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,400
你已经意识到了自己不能讲话
You have realised you are unable to speak.

87
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,610
我们管这个叫…
You have what we call...

88
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,980
…闭锁综合症
...'locked-in syndrome'.

89
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,940
[闭锁综合症]
[locked-in syndrome.]

90
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,610
闭锁综合症
Locked-in syndrome.

91
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:34,280
这必将给你带来诸多不便，但是你的情况十分罕见
It will be of no comfort to you but your condition is extremely rare.

92
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,280
我们对你的病因还毫无头绪
And we simply don't know the cause.

93
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,980
你不吸烟，也不酗酒
You don't smoke and you're not a heavy drinker.

94
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,900
这一切都是突如其来
It just happened all of a sudden.

95
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:48,860
但是，尽管全身瘫痪…
However, apart from being totally paralysed...

96
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,940
…你的其他方面都很正常
...you are normal in every other respect.

97
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:52,780
[正常？]
[Normal?]

98
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,860
还有希望
There is hope.

99
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,900
你的大脑清醒正常
Your brain is functioning.

100
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,900
你能明白我们，你的眼睛随我们的运动而移动
You're able to understand us. You follow our movements with your eyes.

101
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,940
尽管对你的右眼我有些失望
Although I'm not entirely happy with your right eye.

102
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,940
这部分肌肉坏死，看到没？
This muscle doesn't work, see?

103
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,940
眼球缺少水分
The eye doesn't get moisturized.

104
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,110
恐怕我们要把它遮起来
I'm afraid we have to cover that.

105
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,280
是不是？
Don't we?

106
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,030
[遮起来？]
[Cover?]

107
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,730
[他想遮什么？]
[What does he want to cover?]

108
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,820
但是我会想办法补救的
but I'll take a second guess on that.

109
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,980
我们希望你好好休息几天
We want you to take it easy for a few days.

110
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,860
[难道我现在不是在休息吗？]
[What d'you think I'm doing now?]

111
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,770
…之后两个美女会来看你
...and then two beautiful young women will visit you.

112
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,020
可是真正的美女啊
And when I say beautiful, I mean beautiful.

113
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,770
[好]
[Fine.]

114
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:50,190
他们两个棒极了，了不起的治疗师，有妙手回春的本事
They are great. Outstanding therapists and miracle workers.

115
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,070
[别说什么奇迹]
[No miracles please.]

116
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,900
就像我刚说的，还有希望…
And so, as I say, there's hope..

117
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,480
[你刚才的那些就叫希望？]
[That's what you all showed me.]

118
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,400
我们会好好照顾你的，吉多
You'll be well looked after, Jean-Do. Really.

119
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,860
[这话说的好]
[That's a good start.]

120
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,610
我们会好好照顾你的
You'll be well looked after.

121
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,270
早上好
Good morning.

122
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,440
[难道这是在天堂？]
[Have I gone to heaven?]

123
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,560
我叫亨瑞特
I'm Henrite.

124
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,940
- 我是玛丽  - 你可以眨眼，对吗？
- And I'm Marie.  - You can blink your eyes, don't you?

125
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,900
你眨一下眼就是“是”的意思，眨两下眼就是“不是”
So, I want you to blink once for yes, twice for no.

126
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:22,190
[太好了！两个大美人，而我却是不可救药]
[Fine! Two beauties and I'm helpless.]

127
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,850
你能读这个吗？
Can you read that?

128
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,190
[什么？]
[Where?]

129
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,560
- 杜兰德，语言障碍科  - 你能看到“杜兰德”吗？
- H. Durand, logopediste.  - Can you see Durand?

130
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,860
[- 好的，波比先生  - 你是否还是单身？]
[- Good, Mr. Bauby.  - Mrs. or Miss?]

131
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,810
我是你的理疗师，首先你得学会吞咽食物
I'm your physical therapist. First you have to learn again to swallow.

132
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,440
所以我会先帮你在舌头和嘴唇上做些练习
So I'll be working on your tongue and lips.

133
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:40,400
[听起来还挺有意思]
[Sounds fun.]

134
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,190
我是你的语言训练师
And I'm your speech therapist.

135
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,480
在你开口讲话之前，我会想办法叫你和外界交流的
Until you can actually speak again I have to find a way for you to communicate.

136
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,980
你的病情非常罕见
Your condition is extremely rare.

137
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,690
[我知道]
[I know.]

138
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,100
- …所以我们会尽最大努力帮助你  - 那我们现在就开始吧
- ...we're going to have to work very hard.  - So we'd better get started.

139
00:12:55,270 --> 00:13:00,100
没错，我只是过来自我介绍一下的，再见
Exactly. I just came in to introduce myself. See you.

140
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,020
[再见]
[See you.]

141
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,690
我想叫你知道…
I want you to know...

142
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,440
…这大概是我所接受的最重要的工作
...that this is perhaps the most important job I've ever been given.

143
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,850
我势在必得，当然还需要你的帮助支持
and I'm determined to succeed. With your help, of course.

144
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,520
我需要问你几个问题，希望你能理解
I think you understand, but I will ask you some questions.

145
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,150
好吗？
OK?

146
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,350
记住，眨一下眼睛代表“同意”
Remember, you answer by blinking once for yes

147
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,730
两下就表示“反对”
or twice for no..

148
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,520
我是男人吗？
Am I a man?

149
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,230
是女人吗？
Am I a woman?

150
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,100
是不是阳光太刺眼了？
Is the sun too bright for you?

151
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,520
现在是午夜时分吗？
Is it midnight now?

152
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,440
[这都是些什么问题啊？]
[What kinds of questions are this?]

153
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,690
我们现在是在巴黎吗？
Are we in Paris?

154
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,600
那是在贝克吗？
Are we in Berck?

155
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,350
木头能漂浮吗？
Does wood float?

156
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,190
[应该不能吧]
[I don't think so.]

157
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,520
你还记得中风的事吗？
Do you remember having your stroke?

158
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,940
你是《世界时装之苑》杂志主编吗？
Were you the editor of Elle magazine?

159
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,850
[是的，我是《世界时装之苑》的总编]
[Yes, I was the editor-in-chief of Elle.]

160
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,270
到阿勒亚去
To Alyā.

161
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,520
你的右眼功能失常
Your right eye isn't working properly.

162
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,600
能听到我吗？
Can you hear me?

163
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,480
你的右眼功能失常，所以我要把它缝起来
Your right eye isn't working properly. I'm going to sew it up.

164
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,180
[缝起来？]
[Sew it up?]

165
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,640
这是因为…
That happens...

166
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,680
…角膜溃烂的原因
...an ulcerated cornea.

167
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:22,600
我总是去圣莫丽斯滑雪，现在是滑雪的最佳季节
I've been skiing in St. Moritz. It's wonderful there now.

168
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,430
[这个我TMD才不关心]
[I don't give a shit.]

169
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,850
迎风滑下雪坡的感觉真是太爽了
nothing like sailing down a slope with the wind in your face..

170
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,690
[离我远点]
[Keep away from me]

171
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,930
别担心
Don't worry

172
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,520
[滚开]
[keep away from me]

173
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,810
一点都不痛
You won't feel a thing.

174
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,770
[别这样]
[Please.]

175
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,430
[不，请别这样…]
[No, please don't...]

176
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,350
一点都不会痛，别动
You won't feel anything. Just be quiet.

177
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:46,930
[不要]
[Don't]

178
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,600
这种小手术我做的多了去了
I've done this dozens of times.

179
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,430
没事的
It will be fine.

180
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,770
别怕
Don't worry.

181
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,930
再缝几针，马上就好了
Almost done. A few more pinpricks.

182
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:13,100
好极了，真是太好了
Perfect, even if I say so myself.

183
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,100
缝好了
Done.

184
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,850
我们要给你打扮一番，叫你高兴高兴
We're going to dress you to cheer you up a bit.

185
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,390
之后有个意外的惊喜给你
Afterwards we have a surprise.

186
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,770
让你试下这个轮椅
We're going to try you in this wheelchair.

187
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,930
好的
OK.

188
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:12,470
推他几下，好吗？
Wheel him up and down, will you?

189
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,760
这些都是我的学生，别在意他们
These are my students. Pay no attention to them.

190
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:22,680
我想确定他那样坐，不会引起肌肉痉挛
I want to be sure that sitting like that won't trigger uncontrollable muscular spasms.

191
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,510
给他的头部加一个靠垫
He needs a cushion behind his head

192
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,810
对不起，吉多，我们必须这么做，好，好极了
Sorry we have to do this to you, Jean-Do. Excellent. Excellent.

193
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,850
你用这轮椅应该没问题
You can handle the wheelchair.

194
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,510
[你能坐这轮椅～真给我面子啊]
[You can handle the wheelchair. What an honor.]

195
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,680
这是叫你高兴一下的好消息
That is good news.

196
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,930
现在是给你的意外惊喜
And now for the surprise

197
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,260
[哦，天啊，那是谁？是我吗？]
[Oh my God, who's that? Me?]

198
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,600
[我看上去就好像刚从防腐剂液里捞出来一样]
[I look as if I've emerged from a vat of formaldehyde.]

199
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,640
[太可怕了]
[Horrible.]

200
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,850
[这就是给我的意外惊喜吗？就是见识下自己现在的尊容？]
[Is that my surprise? To see myself?]

201
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,180
[席琳]
[Cine.]

202
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,930
你好吗？来，我来给你说明一些情况
How are you? OK, let me explain that.

203
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:44,050
是不是个意外惊喜，吉多？你妻子第一个来探望你
Isn't this a wonderful surprise, Jean-Do? Your first visitor is your wife.

204
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,470
[不，她只是我孩子的母亲]
[No, she's the mother of my children.]

205
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,680
他什么都能理解
He understands everything. Everything.

206
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,800
如果有话问他，最好是“是”或“不是”的问题，好吗？
If you ask a question, make it a yes-or-no question. OK?

207
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:00,180
他会眨眼，眨一下是肯定，两下是否定
He'll blink. One for yes, two for no.

208
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,760
好的
OK.

209
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:08,180
还有一点，说话的时候最好正对着他
One more thing. Stay in front of him when you talk to him. OK?

210
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,470
要是站在这里，或者这里，他就看不到你了
If you stand here, he can't see you, and here neither.

211
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,930
像这样的和他交谈，是不是，吉多？
Talk to him like this. Right, Jean-Do?

212
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,260
你们单独待会儿吧，你们一定有很多话要谈…
I'll leave you. I'm sure you have a lot to say to each other...

213
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,300
他们告诉我，你…
They tell me you're doing...

214
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:50,050
大家都要我问候祝福你
Everyone sends their love. And their prayers.

215
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,930
我没有带孩子们来
I didn't bring the children.

216
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,510
我觉得应该先来看看你
I thought I should see you first.

217
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,930
他们都很好，而且很想念你
They're both well. They miss you.

218
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,760
席莱斯特每晚都为你祈祷
Celeste prays for you every night.

219
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,680
你想见他们吗？
Do you want me to bring them?

220
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,430
你不想见见他们？
Don't you want to see them?

221
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,930
劳伦想来看你，你想见他吗？
Laurent wants to visit. Do you want to see him?

222
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,640
你想见他
Him you want to see.

223
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,090
我会告诉他的
I'll tell him.

224
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,010
她来看过你吗？
Has she been to see you?

225
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,130
我见过你的语言治疗师，我很喜欢她
I've met the speech therapist. I like her.

226
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,260
她觉得她可以帮助你
She thinks she can help you.

227
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,800
别哭
Please don't cry.

228
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:37,340
[我知道贝克车站，能预见她此时的心情]
[I know Berck station. I can see her now.]

229
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,170
[那里是世界上最伤感之地]
[It's the most depressing place in the world.]

230
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,970
[至少对于小时候在那里度假的我来说是伤感之地]
[Well, it certainly was when I had my holidays here as a child.]

231
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,010
[贝克，暑假终结点]
[Berck. The end of summer.]

232
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,220
[和老爸一起默默地等待驶往巴黎的火车]
[Waiting with my father for the Paris train.]

233
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:55,590
[那时的荒凉之地，现在更是凄凉的袅无人烟]
[It was desolate then and it'll be more desolate now.]

234
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:02,050
[我不懂得善待她，对孩子也是如此]
[I treated her so badly. And the children, too.]

235
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:08,300
[而如今我却再没机会弥补这一切]
[And now I will never be able to make amends.]

236
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,720
[再也不能了]
[Never.]

237
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,420
看着这个
Look at this.

238
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,420
你也能看出来，这不是我们所知的字母表
As you can see, it's not the alphabet we learned at school.

239
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:23,010
这些字母是按使用频率安排的
These letters are presented in order of usage frequency.

240
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,210
明白吗？
Do you understand?

241
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:30,090
E，S，A，R，I，N…
E, S, A, R, I, N...

242
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,260
[使用频率？]
[Usage frequency?]

243
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,760
我问过很多同事…
I've talked to a host of colleagues...

244
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,260
…我想我这个方法应该可行
...and I think I've come up with a viable system.

245
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,340
[那恭喜了]
[Good for you.]

246
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,590
方法是这样的
This is how it works.

247
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,590
你想想要说的话，想好之后，就眨眨眼
You think of something to say. When you're ready, blink.

248
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:58,090
我会朗读这些字母，一个字母一个字母的慢慢读
I'll recite this alphabet, very slowly, letter by letter.

249
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,420
当出现你要表达单词的第一个字母时，你就眨眨眼睛
When I get to the first letter of your word, blink.

250
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:06,630
我会记下这个字母，之后以此类推
I'll write it down, letter for letter, and so on.

251
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,960
这样，我们就可以组词造句了
In that way we'll form words and sentences.

252
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:14,340
另外两件事是单词拼好后，眨两下眼睛
Two other things: blink twice when the word is formed.

253
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,260
就好像敲击键盘空格键一样
As if you're hitting the space bar on a keyboard.

254
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,760
要是出错的话，就快速眨眼
And blink rapidly if we make a mistake.

255
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,670
我知道这方法听起来繁琐之极，但是…
I know it sounds terribly arduous but,

256
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,960
相信我，我们很快就会运用自如的
believe me, we'll become expert very quickly.

257
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:29,010
你的朋友和家人也可以用这个方法和你交流
And your friends and family can use it, too.

258
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,590
准备好了吗？看着我
Are you ready for this? Look at me.

259
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,170
想不想试试看？
Do you want to try?

260
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,420
有什么想说的吗？
Have you thought of something you want to say?

261
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,260
好的
Good.

262
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,750
我们开始吧
So, let's begin.

263
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,750
[等下，不要…]
[Wait, no...]

264
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,210
[我不知道该说些什么]
[I don't know what to say.]

265
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:46,750
E！
E.

266
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,800
E是你想说的单词首字母吗？
Is E the first letter?

267
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,630
[不是]
[No.]

268
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,000
E不是首字母
E is not the first letter.

269
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,210
[我不知道该说些什么]
[I don't know what to say.]

270
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:00,090
我知道这并不容易，我们慢慢来
It's difficult, I know, so let's go slowly.

271
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,170
E，S，A…
E, S, A...

272
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,670
[这也太慢了]
[That's too slow.]

273
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:21,000
[我的眼皮可睁不了那么久，快点！]
[I can't keep my eyelids open that long. Get cracking!]

274
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,300
I！
I...

275
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,000
I吗？
I?

276
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,250
[好]
[Good.]

277
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,170
I是首字母吗？
Is I the first word?

278
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,920
[首字母是I，那就从“我”开始吧]
[My first word is I. I begin with myself.]

279
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,420
E，S…
E, S...

280
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,670
S？
S?

281
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,840
[不是]
[No.]

282
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,000
不是？
No?

283
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:43,840
不是S
Not S.

284
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,000
[你刚才念的太快了]
[That was too fast.]

285
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,920
[这方法不行，简直太可怕了，根本不可能行得通]
[It doesn't work. This is a nightmare. It'll never work.]

286
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,800
继续好吗？
Shall we go on?

287
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,590
[我受够了]
[I've had enough.]

288
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,000
[别烦我了]
[Leave me alone.]

289
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,090
[上，下，上]
[Up, down, up.]

290
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,170
[我的腋下]
[Under my arms.]

291
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,830
[我的裆部]
[The back of my legs.]

292
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,090
[我已经四十二岁了…]
[I'm forty-two years old...]

293
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:49,000
[…却象个大婴儿一样被照顾]
[...and I'm being handled like a big baby.]

294
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:55,250
[我的私处就这样被擦洗包裹]
[my private parts wiped and swaddled.]

295
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,000
[真太荒唐了]
[That's ridiculous.]

296
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,170
[但是正如诗中所云]
[But as the poet says:]

297
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,330
[自我嘲讽，自我娱乐嘛～]
[only a fool laughs when there's nothing to laugh at.]

298
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:10,170
给我“啵”一个
Blow me a kiss.

299
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,670
快点啊
Come on.

300
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,920
试试
Try it.

301
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,460
加油
Come on.

302
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,790
努力试下
Try.

303
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,290
这不容易
It's difficult.

304
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,250
[别拿镜子]
[No mirror.]

305
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,630
你要努力练习一下
But that's what I want you to work at.

306
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,750
[不要照我的脸]
[Not that face.]

307
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,500
等你休息或是看电视的时候
When you're resting or watching TV, or any time at all,

308
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:39,250
你要试着练练给我送个香吻
I want you to work at blowing me a kiss.

309
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,250
好吗？
Okay?

310
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,080
[好的]
[Okay.]

311
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,830
另外，你还要尽量多练习的是
And one other thing you have to practise as much as possible.

312
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:49,330
将舌头滑入上颚后部
And that's sliding your tongue to the back of your palate.

313
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,670
这样你就可以吞咽食物了，看着，就象这样
That's how you'll learn to swallow again. Watch.

314
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:03,710
[这太不公平了，不公平啊]
[This just isn't fair. Not fair.]

315
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,000
你试一下
You try it.

316
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,080
[快把镜子拿走]
[Put that mirror away.]

317
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,750
张开嘴
Open your mouth.

318
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,670
好的
Good.

319
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,250
试着把舌头往后滑
Try sliding your tongue backwards.

320
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,830
[我做不到]
[I can't.]

321
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,250
试试，继续
Try, go on.

322
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,580
[不行]
[I can't.]

323
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,170
太好了！你的舌头动了
Good! You moved your tongue.

324
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,580
[别骗我了]
[Don't make a fool of me.]

325
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,330
非常好，再来一次
Very good. Again.

326
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,420
简直难以置信，太好了
Unbelievable. Good.

327
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,420
[没错，真难以置信]
[Yes, but true.]

328
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:55,500
我会帮你练习，直到你可以自己转动头为止，就象这样
I'll help you to move your head on your own. Like that.

329
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,370
[你又来了]
[You're doing it all.]

330
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,210
向左
Left.

331
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,580
好
Good.

332
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:07,170
向右，好
Right. Good.

333
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,210
再向左
Left again.

334
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,500
能感觉到我的手轻抚你的脸吗？
Can you feel my hands on your face?

335
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,330
[不能]
[No.]

336
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,500
没事的，你会感觉到的，会的
Never mind, you will, you will.

337
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,160
我们对你的遭遇深表同情
We're all very sorry for what's happened to you.

338
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:42,460
我是《世界时装之苑》的忠实读者，我爱死那杂志了
I'm a regular reader of Elle. I love it.

339
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,250
我只是希望模特不要太男性化
I just wish all the models didn't look like boys.

340
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,580
[我可不这么看]
[I don't think so.]

341
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,790
现在的模特越来越瘦
They're getting thinner and thinner.

342
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,960
令人费解的流行趋势
An odd fashion.

343
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,750
[她可真美]
[How beautiful she is.]

344
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,910
我信念坚强，每天都会为你祈祷的
I have a strong faith. I pray for you every day.

345
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:16,410
他只有左眼有视力，说话的时候正视他
He can only see with his right eye. Look straight at him when you talk.

346
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,750
[那是谁？]
[Who is that?]

347
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,750
[皮埃尔·罗斯]
[Pierre Roussin.]

348
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,370
还记得我吗？
Do you remember me?

349
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,750
[当然]
[Of course.]

350
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,580
他眨一下眼就是肯定…
He blinks once for yes...

351
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,580
[该死，我没有给他回电话]
[Damn, I didn't call him back.]

352
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:39,000
- 要我回避下吗？ - 不，不用
- Do you want me to leave?  - No, please not.

353
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:42,040
[我为什么没给他回电话呢？]
[Why didn't I call him back?]

354
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,790
我听说了你的遭遇，我只是想…
I heard what happened to you. And I just wanted...

355
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:51,910
因为我的亲身经历，我一定要来看望你
I was compelled to come and see you because of what happened to me.

356
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:59,000
某种程度上来说，我能理解你现在所经历的
In a way, I know what you're going through

357
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:07,040
人质的生活和你现在的境地别无二样
Being taken hostage is not so different from what you're going through,

358
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,410
我说的对吗？
Am I right?

359
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,250
[人质？]
[Hostage?]

360
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:16,830
吉恩-多米尼克善意的将机位让给我
Jean-Dominique was kind enough to give me his seat on a flight

361
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:23,410
结果那架飞机被劫持作为人质，我在贝鲁特关押了四年
The plane was high-jacked and I remained a hostage in Beirut for four years.

362
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,580
一共是四年，四个月，两周，五天
Four years, four months, two weeks, five days

363
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,700
外加七小时
and seven hours.

364
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:34,660
他们把我关押在又小又黑的地窖里
They kept me in a cellar. Very small. Dark.

365
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,750
那里简直令人窒息
It was hard to breathe.

366
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,490
我称之为我的坟墓
I called it my tomb.

367
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,750
我对酒颇有研究
I know, a lot about wines.

368
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,660
[他的手是怎么了？]
[What happened to his hand?]

369
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:56,330
我经常高声背诵一八五五年波尔多葡萄酒分类
I used to recite aloud the wines of the Bordeaux classification of 1855.

370
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:02,740
玛歌酒，拉菲酒，波亚克酒
Chateau Margaux, Margaux. Chateau Lafite Rotschild, Pauillac.

371
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:10,660
这些促使我活下来
That's what preserved my sanity.

372
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:21,490
绝大多数时间，我都极度郁闷，自暴自弃，满腔仇恨
Most times, I was in despair. Suicidal. Angry.

373
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:28,410
我所遭受的毒打，残暴和污言秽语
The beatings, the filth, the cruelty.

374
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,910
但是最难以忍受的还是那份焦灼的等待
But the worst was the waiting.

375
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,950
可我最终还是活了下来
I survived.

376
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,910
我之所以活下来，是因为坚守自己的尊严
I survived, because I held fast to my own humanity.

377
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,950
那是我仅存的东西，也是我唯一可以做的事情
That's all I could do because that's all I had,

378
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,080
就像此时的你一样
just like you.

379
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:01,830
坚守尊严，你就能坚强的活下来
Cling to your own humanity and you'll survive.

380
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,240
[尊严？我没听错吧？]
[Humanity? Easy.]

381
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,660
我只是想亲口对你说这些
I just had to say that to you in person.

382
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,490
[为什么他从贝鲁特回来时，我没有给他打电话？]
[Why didn't I call him, when he was back from Beirut?]

383
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,370
[我好过意不去啊]
[I felt too guilty.]

384
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,240
很可笑…
It's ridiculous...

385
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,530
[不，我真是无耻]
[It's not. I feel ashamed.]

386
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:33,570
I？
I?

387
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,490
W？
W?

388
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:38,830
我想？
I want?

389
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,240
你想要什么，波比先生？
What do you want, Mr. Bauby?

390
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,660
D！
D.

391
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,490
I！
I.

392
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:16,910
E！
E.

393
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,410
死
Die.

394
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:27,240
你想要死？
You want to die?

395
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,490
你怎么敢这么想？
How dare you!

396
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,990
这么多爱你关心你的人
There are people who love you and care for you.

397
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,570
我和你素不相识，却也在这里帮助你
I hardly know you and yet I'm there for you.

398
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,660
你还活着，所以，别说什么“想要死”之类的话
And you're alive. So, don't say you want to die.

399
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,070
这太无礼了
It's offensive and obscene.

400
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,660
还想继续吗？
You want to continue?

401
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,240
好吧
Alright.

402
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,660
我一会再来，看你是不是会改变想法
I'll come back another time and see if you've changed your mind.

403
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,240
对不起
I'm sorry.

404
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,110
[为什么？]
[Why?]

405
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,320
我说的太过了
I went too far.

406
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:47,160
你好好休息吧
Rest yourself.

407
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:05,900
喜欢吗？我实在不知道该带什么来看你
Do you like it? I didn't really know what to bring.

408
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,490
看，我还带了这个来
Look, I also brought this.

409
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,360
等一下啊
One moment.

410
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,150
[你这是干什么？]
[What are you doing?]

411
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:15,490
[那是什么东西？]
[What is that?]

412
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,990
[不要啊，带上会看上去象兔子]
[That's not true. This makes me look like a rabbit.]

413
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,650
我读字母，你眨眼睛，好吗？
I just read the letters and you blink, is that OK?

414
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,990
[随你吧]
[Let it be.]

415
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:26,490
准备好了？
OK?

416
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,570
S还是A
S of A?

417
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,240
[随你便]
[As you want it.]

418
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,490
[A！]
[A.]

419
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:38,570
[好，那就A吧]
[Good then A.]

420
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,740
N？
N?

421
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,610
[好，N]
[Good, N.]

422
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:52,990
[安娜]
[Anne.]

423
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:58,990
[劳伦，你得看我才成啊]
[You have to look at me, Laurent.]

424
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:04,320
糟了，我忘了看你了，对不起，我再来一次，这次慢点
Shit, I forgot to look at you. Sorry, I'll start again and slow down.

425
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,740
[随你…]
[As you like it...]

426
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,900
[真有趣]
[Funny.]

427
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:19,110
我从来都不知道如何探视病人
I've never been a good hospital visitor.

428
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,820
我只会带吃的来，然后自己把它打扫了
I'm the sort who brings food and then eats it.

429
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,740
[不是这样的]
[That's not true.]

430
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,740
为什么这事会发生在你身上？
Why did that have to happen to you?

431
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:28,490
大家都在谈论你，昨晚，我在甫洛咖啡馆…
Everybody's talking about it. I was in Cafe de Flore last night...

432
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:34,240
…我听见有人说“你们知道吗，现在吉多成植物人了？”
...I heard someone say, 'Did you know that Jean-Do Bauby is now a complete vegetable?'

433
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,240
[植物人]
[Vegetable.]

434
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,610
他看不到你
He can't see you.

435
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,400
[是谁说的？]
[Who said that?]

436
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,820
[哪种“植物”人？]
[And what sort of vegetable?]

437
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,740
[胡萝卜，土豆还是腌黄瓜？]
[A carrot, a potato, a pickled cucumber?]

438
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:05,900
[如今看来，我的人生是如此的失败]
[Today it seems to me that my whole life was nothing but a string of failures.]

439
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:12,860
[那些我无法去爱的女人，那些没有把握住的机会…]
[the women I was unable to love, the chances I failed to seize...]

440
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:17,150
[…那些不曾珍惜的幸福时光…]
[...the moments of happiness I allowed to drift away...]

441
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,150
[就好像早已能预见到结局的比赛…]
[A race whose result you know beforehand...]

442
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:23,400
[…但我却偏偏下错赌注]
[...but in which you fail to bet on the winner.]

443
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,730
[我是不是瞎了，或是呆了？]
[Have I been blind or stupid?]

444
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:32,110
[亦或是只有在残酷现实中，人的本质才得以体现？]
[Or does it take the harsh light of disaster to to show a person their true nature?]

445
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,570
我又回来了
I'm still here.

446
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,940
今天想和我一起努力下吗？
Would you like me to work with you today?

447
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,560
好的
Good.

448
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,730
这个我们会驾轻就熟的
We're going to master this.

449
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,980
同意吗？
Do you agree?

450
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,230
[是的，老大]
[Yes, mistress.]

451
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,900
好的
OK.

452
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,400
那我开始啦
I'll begin.

453
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,980

谢谢
Thank you.

459
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,150
我能叫你吉多吗？
May I call you Jean-Do?

460
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,730
[女人其实很简单]
[Women are not complicated.]

461
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,610
谢谢你，吉多
Thank you, Jean-Do.

462
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,150
I？
I?

463
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,980
我已经？

464
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:18,350
[我决定不再自暴自弃]
[I have decided not feel sorry for myself again.]

465
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:27,310
[除了我的眼睛外，还有两样东西没有瘫痪]
[Apart from my eyes, there two more things that aren't paralysed.]

466
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,230
[我的想象…]
[My imagination...]

467
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,480
[…以及我的记忆]
[...and my memory.]

468
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,980
[只有想象和记忆才能令我摆脱潜水钟的束服]
[My imagination and my memory are the only way I can escape my diving bell.]

469
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:22,730
[我的想象可以自由驰骋]
[I can imagine anything, anyone, anywhere]

470
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:33,150
[想象中，马提尼克岛的海水冲刷我的躯体]
[I let the sea wash over me on the isle of Martinique.]

471
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,060
[想象中，我探访深爱着的女人]

473
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:58,890
[我的想象无所不涉]

474
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:05,640
[小时候我就常常幻想着长大]
[As a child I dreamed of my abilities as an adult.]

475
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,690
[如今我却想记住从前的自己]
[Now I want to remember myself as I was.]

476
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:13,560
[潇洒，快乐，风度翩翩]
[Handsome, debonair, glamorous. And devilishly attractive]

477
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:16,810
[没错，就是有人夸我潇洒，风度翩翩]
[Yes, glamorous and handsome, some people said.]

478
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:19,180
[那可不是我，那是马龙·白兰度]
[That's not me, that's Marlon Brando.]

479
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,730

My name is Henrite Durand. I'm a therapist at Berck-sur-Mer Naval Hospital.

我是代表我的病人吉恩-多米尼克·波比打电话给你的
I'm calling on behalf of one of my patients, Jean-Dominique Bauby.

483
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,810
吉多？他还好吗？
Jean-Do? How is he?

484
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,980
- 很惬意，但是…  - 我听说他全身瘫痪了
- Comfortable but...  - I heard he's completely paralyzed.

485
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:20,890
- 不能与外界交流  - 并不完全这样
- That he can't communicate with anybody.  - That's not absolutely accurate.

486
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,680
请进

487
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:28,390
他想请您帮个忙

当然了，请稍等一下

489
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:33,140
什么忙都可以
Anything.

490
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:36,600
他告诉我和您有一本书的合约
He says he has a contract with you for a book.

491
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:39,640
这是他说的？那就是说他可以说话了，真没想到
He said that? He can speak, I thought he couldn't speak.

492
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:44,310
他可以的，某种程度上，我一会儿解释给你
He can. In a way. I'll explain later.

- He wants to write the book.  - You can't be serious?

496
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:02,430
我向您保证，他可以的
Let me assure you, he can.

497
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:09,600
但是您能不能找个人，帮他记录书稿？
but do you think you can find someone to take his dictation?

498
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,470
找个耐心的人
Someone who's patient.

499
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:18,390
有充裕时间的，特别的人
Somebody with a lot of time. Someone special.

500
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,720
我明白，我回头联系你

说她是最合适的人选
She said no one could be more perfect for this.

503
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:33,140
贝蒂总是喜欢夸大其辞，我还要和亨瑞特多多练习
Betty always exaggerates. I will have to practise with Henrite.

504
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:35,560
时刻练习
Any time.

505
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,060
他有话要说
He wants to say something.

506
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:48,390
不？
No?

507
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,140
别紧张

00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:14,310
克劳德在医院有个房间，也许你们可以讨论下写书的事情

[我们明天开始，好吗？]
[Can we begin tomorrow?]

514
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,350
没问题
Of course.

515
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,010

[这幅贝克郊外景致]
[And I enjoy seeing the suburbs of Berck]

539
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,890
[如同火车布景模型般令我陶醉…]
[that look like a model train lay-out..]

540
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:51,050
[如此白炽的海浪]
[The sea foams such an incandescent white that it might]

541
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,380
[如同特效营造的产物]
[be the product of the special-effects department.]

542
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:56,800
[但我最欣赏的却是灯塔]
[But my favorite sight of all is the lighthouse.]

543
00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:01,470
[那红白相间的条纹，令人倍感高大，坚固，可靠…]
[tall, robust, reassuring in red and white stripes..]

544
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:05,760
[我将自己置身于这亲切的标志庇护之下…]
[I place myself under the protection of this brotherly symbol...]

545
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:09,630
[…它不仅仅是水手的庇护…]
[...guardian not just of sailors but of the sick...]

546
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,720
[…也能将生命垂危之人远离病痛]
[...whom fate has cast to the far edge of life.]

547

这个小型博物馆的两大亮点就是白色大理石胸像…
The two highlights of this mini museum are a white marble bust...

548
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:25,130
…刻画的是
...which embodies the radiant youth

549
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,420
…一位神采奕奕的年轻公主…
...of a princess who died with 94...

550

[五小时的成果，还不赖]
[Five hours of work. Doesn't sound bad.]

[我不是巴尔扎克]
[It's not Balzac.]

552
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:40,970
还要我继续吗？
Shall I continue?

553
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:47,220
[给我读读巴尔扎克]
[Read Balzac to me.]

554
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:50,630
[或者是格雷厄姆·格林（格雷厄姆·格林为英国小说家，剧作家）]
[Or Graham Greene.]

I'm 45 divorced, and I want to speak the consul.

556
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:48,800
- 那是谁？ - 是男的还是女的？
- What's that?  - Is it a man or a woman?

557
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:56,050
- 我觉得是男的  - 他在向你眨眼示意呢
- A man. I think.  - He winked at you.

558
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:03,260
打扰下，是你订的扬声电话吗？
Excuse me, but did you order a speaker phone?

559
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:11,460
你订了电话吗？
Did you order a phone?

560
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,550
我们走吧
Let's get out of here.

561
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:21,300
谁叫你们进来的？你们是干什么的？
Who let you in? What are you doing?

562
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,090
我们是法国电信局的
We're from Telecom France.

563
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:28,460
- 你们应该先去楼下接待处的  - 刚才那儿没人
- You should have gone to Reception first.  - There was no one there.

564
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,800
把电话装在桌子那儿，谢谢
Just install it by the table, please, thank you.

565
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,300
轻点，谢谢
Be careful, please.

566
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:45,550
我们会通知其他人，你有自己的专用电话
We'll let people know you've got a phone now.

567
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:47,960
他们打电话来需要提前预约
They'll have to book a time for their calls.

568
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:50,550
到时候会有人在这里陪你
We'll make sure someone's with you.

569
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,130
对不起，女士，他不能说话吗？
Excuse me, madame, can't he speak?

570
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,960
别以这种目中无人的口气说话
Don't talk about him as if he weren't here.

571
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:03,380
你问他啊
Ask him.

572
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:07,550
女士，对不起，要是他不能讲话的话，要电话做什么？
Madame, excuse me, but, if he can't speak what's he want a phone for?

573
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:10,050
也许他可以喘粗气
Perhaps he's a heavy breather.

574
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:15,750
你觉得自己很幽默吗？
You think you're funny?

575
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,210
你怎么能这样！
How dare you!

576
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:24,630
[看来你缺乏幽默感啊，亨瑞特]
[You miss a sense of humor, Henrite.]

577
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:30,460
三，慢点，四

578
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:50,630
[一只黑苍蝇停在我的鼻头上]
[A very black fly settles on my nose.]

579
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:56,170
[我摇头想赶走它，它却一动不动…]
[I waggle my head to unseat him. He digs in..]

580
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,460
[和这相比，奥运摔跤就是小儿科]
[Olympic wrestling is child's play compared to this.]

581
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:02,420
你的头动了，你是什么时候会做的？
You moved your head. When did you start doing that?

582
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:04,210
[谢谢]
[Thank you.]

583
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,630
刚刚？
Just now?

584
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,670
真是奇迹！你现在可以转动头了！
A miracle! You can turn your head!

585
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,380
[玛丽眼里到处都是奇迹]
[Marie sees miracles everywhere.]

586
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,960
莱裴奇医生，他的头动了
Dr. Lepage, he moved his head.

587
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:24,920
早上好啊
Good morning.

588
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,130
[真是奇迹！他终于知道说早上好了]
[A miracle! He only said good morning once!]

589
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:28,880
进展，这就是进展
Progress, progress.

590
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,130
[这很好]
[That's better.]

591
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:36,040
- 他的舌头怎么样？ - 张开嘴
- How's the tongue?  - I'll open your mouth.

592
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:41,290
舌头动了
The tongue moves

593
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,380
那我们就可以在他的语言功能上再下下功夫了
Then we can go further with his speech.

594
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,380
舌头的运动至关重要，所以你有希望你恢复语言功能
The movement of the tongue is crucial so there's hope.

595
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,960
好，实在是太好了
Great, that's awesome.

596
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:53,380
我们会努力的，很快你就可以正常吃饭了
We're going to work really hard, soon you'll be able to eat normally.

597

[文字只有在阅读时才是真实存在的]
[A text is only real when it's read.]

598
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:03,460
[我出事之前帮我爸爸刮了胡子]
[I shaved my father when I visited him the last time before my accident.]

599
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:08,540
[他身体不适，所以我整夜留在他巴黎的公寓里陪他]
[He was unwell and I stayed overnight in his apartment in Paris.]

600
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:12,960
[转天早上，我帮他刮了胡子]
[The next morning I shaved his stubble.]

601
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:17,000
- 我刮胡子给谁看呢？ - 给我
- Who can see if I'm shaven?  - Me.

602
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:21,790
- 我好怕  - 怕什么？
- I'm terrified.  - Of what?

603
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,460
你给我刮胡子
You shaving me.

604
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,750
- 你总是笨手笨脚的  - 这是从你那遗传的
- You were always so damned clumsy.  - That runs in the family.

605
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,420
没错
Sure.

606
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,790
- 要咖啡吗？ - 不要
- Coffee?  - No.

607
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:42,540
- 别折腾他了，他不舒服  - 刮胡子怎么算是折腾？
- Don't tire him. He's not well.  - How can a shave tire him?

608
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:53,460
- 你妈妈更漂亮些  - 没错
- Your mother was prettier.  - That wouldn't be difficult.

609
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:57,000
- 你还记得你妈妈吗？ - 当然了
- Do you remember your mother?  - Oh yeah.

610
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:02,830
你总问我这个问题，我以前总是回答“记不清了”
You always ask me that and I always say the same thing: not really.

611
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,630
你现在在读什么书？
What are you reading at the moment?

612
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:12,420
基督山伯爵
Reading. The Count of Monte Cristo.

613
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:12,960
为什么？
Why?

614
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:17,830
因为我想写个现代版的
Because I'm thinking of writing a modern version.

615
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,040
- 现代版的基督山伯爵？ - 是啊
- Of the Count of Monte Cristo?  - Yes.

616
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:25,540
当然复仇还会是作品的主线…
Vengeance will still be the driving force...

617
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:30,040
…但我会把场景设在当今，而且基督山伯爵会是个女人
...but I'm setting it in today's world. And Monte Cristo will be a woman.

618
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:36,580
- 基督山女伯爵？ - 对，就是个女人
- The Countess of Monte Cristo..?  - Yes, a woman.

619
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:42,420
- 那我是不会读的  - 书我还没开始写呢
- I don't want to read it.  - I haven't written it yet.

620
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:47,540
但是我已经和出版商签了合约
But I've got a contract with a book publisher.

621
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:54,790
你要是把我刮伤了，我可要告你
If you cut me, I'll sue.

622
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:04,370
- 医生昨天来过了  - 说了什么？
- The doctor came yesterday.  - And?

623
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:11,290
- 他说我能活到一百岁  - 好啊，我一定给你好好庆祝一下
- He says I'll live to be a hundred.  - Good. I'll give you a great party.

624
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:16,040
我是不会出席的，又有谁想活到一百岁呢？
I won't attend. Who wants to live to be a hundred?

625
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:20,960
吉多，谁都别告诉
Jean-Do, don't tell a soul.

626
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,370
我还想念着你妈妈
I still miss your mother.

627
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:31,040
我不会告诉别人的，这是我们之间的秘密
I won't. It's our secret.

628
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:37,290
- 你应该和席琳结婚的  - 会有什么区别吗？
- You should have married Cine.  - What difference would that have made?

629
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:44,210
那样你就不会轻易离开她，也不会离开你的孩子们
You wouldn't have left her so easily. And your children.

630
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:48,960
- 我们非要谈这个吗？ - 我知道自己在说什么
- Do we have to talk about this?  - I know what I'm talking about.

631
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:56,040
没人比我的情史丰富，当然，也许只有卡萨诺瓦一个人吧
No one had more affairs than I did. Well, maybe Casanova, but no one else.

632
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,370
和别的女人有染
Having an affair with another woman is no reason

633
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:02,210
并不能成为你离开孩子母亲的原因
for leaving the mother of your children.

634
00:56:02,410 --> 00:56:08,040
现在再也没有什么道德标准了，这一点都不可笑，是事实
There are no standards anymore. It's not funny, it's true.

635
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:15,120
带孩子们来看我，席琳会带他们来
And bring your children to see me. Sylvie brings them, too.

636
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:20,210
- 你也该这么做  - 好的，只是我一直没有时间
- You should bring them as well.  - OK, I haven't found time yet.

637
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,950
- 来  - 那是什么？
- Here.  - What is that?

638
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:27,960
- 橙花水  - 我可不想闻起来象妓女
- Orange blossom.  - Do I have to smell like a tart?

639
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:32,290
这可是春药的味道
It's an aphrodisiac.

640
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:36,700
好，那姑娘们就会闻风而逃
Good. That'll make the girls come running.

641
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:40,870
没错，但是他们还是会闻到你身上的味道
Sure, but give them a chance to smell you.

642
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:43,790
让我来照照镜子
Let me look at myself.

643
00:56:58,370 --> 00:57:02,950
还不错嘛，这看起来都不像我了
Not bad. My God, they don't make them like me anymore.

644
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:21,790
我本来有话要告诉你的
I wanted to tell you something.

645
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:27,290
- 不过我不记得了  - 会想起来的
- Can't remember.  - It'll come back.

646
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:28,870
我可不这么想
I'm not so sure.

647
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:33,250
- 遗忘的东西越来越多  - 别夸大
- I remember less and less.  - Don't exaggerate.

648
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:36,990
哦，我想起来了
Oh yes, I remember.

649
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:44,500
我以你为荣，真的
I'm very proud of you. I really am.

650
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:50,620
还有些别的…
And something else...

651
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,290
实在记不得了
Can't remember.

652
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:03,660
[父亲的赞同，那时令我欣慰…]
[A father's approval. I found it comforting then...]

653
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:08,450
[…现在觉得更加令人欢心鼓舞]
[...and I find it even more comforting now. We are all children.]

654
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:11,700
[我们都是孩子，我们都需要别人的肯定]
[We all need approval.]

655
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:15,030
[我想见见我的孩子]
[I want to see my children.]

656
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,950
[我想见见我的孩子]
[I want to see my children.]

657
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:25,450
我们来了，今天是父亲节
Here we are. Father's Day.

658
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:28,120
父亲节快乐
Happy Father's Day!

659
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:45,620
[我想即使是一张草图，一个阴影，一些碎片，都是磨灭不了的父亲形象]
[I guess that even a rough sketch, a shadow, a tiny fragment of a dad is still a dad.]

660
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:14,200
[父亲节这天，儿子为我擦拭掉唇边流下的口水]
[Father's Day. My son wiping the saliva that escapes my closed lips.]

661
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:18,870
[之前我们从未共同庆祝过这种节日]
[We have never before fitted this made-up holiday into our emotional calendar.]

662
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:37,700
克劳德说书进展很顺利，我简直不敢相信你在写作
Claude says the book's going well. I can't believe you're writing it.

663
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:40,870
我始终认为你是我所认识最不可思议的男人
I still think you're the most surprising man I've ever known.

664
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,370
来看望你的人多吗？
Have you had lots of visitors?

665
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:50,740
劳伦，安娜-玛丽…
Laurent, Anne-Marie...

666
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,370
…米歇尔…
...Michel...

667
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:58,780
就这些？她没有来？
That's it? She hasn't?

668
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:04,200
我还以为她疯狂的爱着你呢
I thought she was supposed to be madly in love with you.

669
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,620
算了，那是她的事
Well, that's her business.

670
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,780
我们来练习一下字母表好吗？
Shall we practice that alphabet?

671
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:04,700
我中风前一周开始节食
When I began a diet a week before my stroke

672
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:10,610
…从没想过会有这么显著的成果
...I never dreamed of such dramatic results.

673
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:21,450
现在他们知道有个丑八怪爸爸是什么感觉了，谢谢
Now they know what it's like to have a zombie for a father. Thank you.

674
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,950
这可一点都不好笑
That's not amusing.

675
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,700
孩子们
Kids.

676
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:28,530
想不想玩猜词游戏，爸爸？
You want to play Hangman, dad?

677
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:33,110
我来帮你，小声说个字
I'll help you. Whisper a word.

678
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:39,200
第一个字母是C，最后一个字母是E，整个单词一共七个字母
The first letter is a C, the last an E. The word has 7 letters.

679
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:44,070
就这些
That's it.

680
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:47,280
来和爸爸道别，我们该走了
Say goodbye to your dad, kids. We're leaving.

681
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:48,860
再见，爸爸
Bye, dad.

682
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:52,110
再见，爸爸
Bye, dad.

683
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:03,860
再见，爸爸，下周见
Bye dad. See you next week.

684
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:34,900
[我的自责难以言表]
[It's hard to describe my grief.]

685
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:42,110
[我是他们的父亲，却不能触摸他们，无法轻抚他们的头发…]
[I'm their father, but I can't touch them, run my fingers through their hair...]

686
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:46,030
[…无法紧紧的拥抱他们]
[...and hug them tight.]

687
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:51,780
[但是我喜欢静静的看他们玩耍和嘻笑]
[But I like to see them play and laugh.]

688
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:56,690
[这就是我对美好一天的定义]
[That's what I call a wonderful day..]

689
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,070
[我有些自怨自艾，是不是？]
[I feel sorry for myself, don't you think?]

690
01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:06,780
你以前真的很幸福
You were genuinely happy.

691
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,480
[你真这么想？]
[You think so?]

692
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:12,190
[也许吧]
[Perhaps.]

693
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:23,780
[我不想错过这比赛，一边去！]
[I don't want to miss this. Step aside!]

694
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,860
好好享用，再见
Enjoy. See you.

695
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:34,190
[再见，你在干什么？]
[Yeah, see you. What are you doing?]

696
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:45,610
[我想要视觉大餐，或是我该出去饱餐一顿？]
[I want TV-meals. Or shall I go out for dinner?]

697
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:52,110
[我应该去拉杜克好好享受一下]
[I will treat myself to a feast at Le Duc.]

698
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:07,110
- 在这里遇到你真巧  - 这不是很美妙吗？
- What a coincidence to find you here.  - Isn't that amazing?

699
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,190
吃牡蛎吗？
An oyster?

700
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:54,690
一切都如同梦境般美好
It seems like it was just yesterday when I first heard your name.

701
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:18,520
甜美
Sweet.

702
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:24,190
别恭维我
No compliments.

703
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:29,610
开始下一章吗？
And the next chapter?

704
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:33,350
[周日，我惧怕周日]
[Sunday. I dread Sunday.]

705
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,150
[他们打开电视]
[When they turn the TV on,]

706
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:39,190
[是绝好的一招]
[they have to make sure they're doing it right.]

707
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:41,270
[及其具有战略性]
[That is very strategic.]

708
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:48,020
[通常几个小时才会有人来瞅你一眼]
[It can take hours until the next good Samaritan comes by.]

709
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:52,520
[周日，太可怕了，没有语言医师，没有精神医师]
[Horrible, these Sundays. No speech therapists, no psychotherapist.]

710
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:57,190
[没有理疗师，没有访客，只有空旷的医院]
[No physiotherapist, no visitors. A skeleton staff.]

711
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,770
[周日就是荒凉的代名词]
[Sunday is a long stretch of desert.]

712
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:05,020
[但是今天，玛丽善意的提出要带我去做弥撒]
[But today, Marie nobly suggests she takes me to mass.]

713
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:10,310
[我试图解释自己并不是什么信徒，不过无济于事]
[I have tried to explain to her that I am not a religious man, but without avail.]

714
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:13,100
[全世界都在为我祈祷]
[All over the world people are praying for me.]

715
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:15,440
[最虔诚的就是我女儿席莱斯特]
[Top of the list is my daughter, Cileicester]

716
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:18,350
[当然还有玛丽]
[And Marie, of course.]

717
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:23,770
[众神都被召集，来帮助我]
[The most diverse deities have been enlisted to help me.]

718
01:08:24,190 --> 01:08:27,270
[在尼泊尔，听说人们在为我颂歌]
[In Nepal, I'm told, they chant a mantra for me.]

719
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:32,810
[在喀麦隆，人们在为我祈求非洲之神的祝福]
[In Cameroon holy man has procured for me the goodwill of Africa's gods.]

720
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,600
[我已经为他献上了我的右眼]
[I have assigned him my right eye.]

721
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:41,690
[我承认自己试图依赖这神圣的精神力量…]
[I can't deny that I have attempted to organise this vast spiritual energy...]

722
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:43,850
[…作为活下去的动力]
[...to support my existence.]

723
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:49,600
[这也许不足为题，也许是自欺欺人，但是我会竭尽所能，奋力一搏]
[It may not be admirable, it may even be a touch hypocritical, but I'll try anything.]

724
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,440
很高兴在这里见到你
I'm very pleased to see you here.

725
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,850
几天前我探望过你
I came to visit you a few days ago. I brought

726
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:06,270
给你带了圣餐
the Blessed Sacrament to give you Communion.

727
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,230
但是当时你在睡觉
But you were asleep.

728
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:12,270
- 对，他是睡着了  - 什么？
- Yes, he was asleep.  - What?

729
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,310
你现在想接受圣餐礼吗？
Would you like me to give you Holy Communion now?

730
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:15,600
不
No.

731
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:17,940
是的
Yes.

732
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:19,600
想叫我为你祝福吗？
Would you like me to say a blessing over you?

733
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:21,770
- 不要  - 好的
- No.  - Yes.

734
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:25,100
神圣的主啊，请施恩于吉恩-多米尼克
Heavenly Father, have mercy on Jean-Dominique,

735
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:26,440
他正遭受折磨
who is cruelly afflicted.

736
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:33,100
请治愈他的肉体，令他卸下精神上的负担
Help his body to heal, keep his spirits buoyant,

737
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:36,020
[- …帮助他获得信念  - 我精神上没负担啊，神父]
[- ...and help him to find faith.  - My spirit is very buoyant, mister.]

738
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:39,890
[- 以神父，圣子…  - 你耍我啊]
[- In the name of the father...  - You made a fool of me.]

739
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:55,100
神？
Fa?

740
01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:00,600
神父？
Father?

741
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:22,810
以前…
There are...

742
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:28,430
[神父，波尔多的修道士经常为我祈祷]
[Father, there are monks in Bordeaux who regularly dedicate their prayers to me.]

743
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,350
…经常为我祈祷
...who regularly dedicate their prayers to me.

744
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:36,850
- 是吗？那太好了  - 但是其效果甚微
- Do they, that's good.  - But the results have been unremarkable.

745
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,520
我们一定要耐心
We must be patient.

746
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,850
[对，医生们也这么说]
[Yes, the doctors say that, too.]

747
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:44,180
吉恩-多米尼克，我想提个建议
But Jean-Dominque, I want to suggest something to you

748
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:47,930
几周后，我会引领卢尔德朝圣
In a few weeks time, I shall be leading a pilgrimage to Lourdes.

749
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,180
[卢尔德？]
[Lourdes?]

750
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:52,390
比特丽思和我觉得你可能也愿意加入
Dear Beatrice and I thought you might want to be part of it.

751
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:53,350
[这是个圈套]
[This is a trap.]

752
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:55,020
已经有些病人在那里神奇的康复了
There have been some miraculous cures.

753
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:56,140
没错
That's true.

754
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:58,100
[我去过卢尔德]
[I've been to Lourdes.]

755
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:28,640
- 就到这里，我们往回开吧  - 我不走回头路的
- Let's stop and return.  - I am not turning back.

756
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:31,060
这是我的车，我想开到哪都行
Hit's my car, I'll drive where I like.

757
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:34,350
- 你说了想过个疯狂的周末  - 我可没这么说过
- You said you wanted a dirty weekend.  - I never said that.

758
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:35,430
你说过
Yes you did.

759
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,180
卢尔德可不是过疯狂周末的地方
Lourdes is not the right place for a dirty week-end.

760
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:41,760
你怎么一根筋啊！
You've got a one-track mind.

761
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:46,220
我想去看圣母玛利亚
I want to see the Madonna.

762
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:52,680
- 我才不相信那些东西  - 我想去看看，并且尝尝圣水
- I don't believe in any of this.  - I want to see her and drink holy water.

763
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,760
饶了我吧
Spare me this.

764
01:11:56,970 --> 01:12:00,010
你也该这么做，这对你有好处
You should do that too. It will be good for you.

765
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:08,220
很壮观，是不是？
Imposing, hm?

766
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:14,350
我去买盛圣水的瓶子
I'll buy some bottles for the holy water.

767
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:43,350
- 我受不了了，我要走了  - 别，这对你有好处
- That's it for me. I'm leaving.  - Stay. It could do you a lot of good.

768
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:46,850
别那么肯定，说不定会很危险
Don't be so sure, it might be dangerous.

769
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:49,350
要是圣母玛利亚显灵的时候
What if someone in perfect health happened to be here when

770
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:50,310
这正好站着个身强力壮的人怎么办？
the Madonna appeared?

771
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:52,100
奇迹显现，他瘫患了
One miracle, and he'd end up paralyzed.

772
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:53,850
你这人太不虔诚了
You are terrible.

773
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:57,180
- 你好  - 你好，女士
- Hello.  - Good day, madam.

774
01:12:57,390 --> 01:13:00,180
看！那是属于我的圣母！
Look! Here's my Madonna!

775
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:08,100
- 别瞎想了  - 好，那你以后少搭理我
- Forget it.  - Yeah, get out of my life.

776
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:12,600
好吧，这个我送你
Okay, I'll give it to you as a present

777
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:18,930
圣母有天眼，这尊像是红衣大主教开过光的
Madame has a wonderful eye. This Madonna been blessed by the Cardinal.

778
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:22,260
- 我们还有三一八吗？ - 到储藏室找找看
- Do we have more 318's?  - Look in the storage.

779
01:13:22,510 --> 01:13:25,930
- 多少钱？ - 一千八百九十九法郎
- How much is that?  - 1899 franc.

780
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:35,300
- 我们认识吗？ - 我可不这么想，先生
- Don't we know each other?  - I don't think so, Mister.

781
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:39,760
我没有零钱
I don't have change.

782
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:45,510
她这么一直盯着，我怎么和你做爱？
I can't make love to you with her looking at me.

783
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,760
我明白
I understand.

784
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:50,640
我这可不是在陈述事实，我这是在抱怨
I wasn't stating a fact, I was making a complaint.

785
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:51,840
我去把她关上
Let me turn her off

786
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:54,470
不
No.

787
01:13:56,970 --> 01:14:01,050
这是世上唯一一个被红衣大主教开过光的圣母
The only one in the whole world. Blessed by the Cardinal.

788
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:07,680
约瑟芬，回了巴黎我们就得分手
Josephine, when we get back to Paris we're going to have to split up.

789
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:13,350
- 因为她吗？ - 不，因为我们之间的一切
- Because of her?  - No. Because of everything.

790
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:18,510
好吧，你说的没错
OK, you're right.

791
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:34,970
- 我要再出去一下  - 把灯关上
- I'll go out again.  - Turn off the lights.

792
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,340
别关我的圣母
But not my Madonna.

793
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:14,970
加油，吉多
Come on, Jean-Do.

794
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:23,630
要是你学会发“L”的音，就可以吞咽食物了
If you learn the L sound you'll learn to swallow.

795
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,130
你就能开口说卢尔德了
And you'll learn to say Lourdes.

796
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:37,800
这样可以吗？舒服吗？
Is that okay? Is it comfortable?

797
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:58,130
[《高压锅》这个题目可以作为我正在描写的…]
['The Pressure Cooker' could be the title of the piece...]

798
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:01,760
[…这里所经历的一切]
[...I'm writing about my experiences here.]

799
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:05,590
[也可以起名叫《眼睛》或者是《潜水钟》]
[I could also call it 'The Eye' or 'The Diving Bell'.]

800
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:08,550
[地点和情节大家想必已经了解]
[Plot and location are well known.]

801
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:12,510
[在病房中，正值壮年的L先生…]
[In a hospital room, there's Mr. L, at the climax of his life...]

802
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:18,510
[…在经历了一次严重中风之后，正与闭锁性综合症相依为命]
[...trying to live with locked-in syndrome after a serious stroke.]

803
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:23,420
[雄心勃勃又稍稍有些愤世嫉俗的L先生…]
[Ambitious and somewhat cynical, because he didn't know failures before...]

804
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:27,300
[…在遭遇此次不幸之前，还未曾品味过失败的痛苦]
[...becomes acquainted with misfortune.]

805
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:30,840
[当你们还在缓缓聆听…]
[We his slow transformation listening to a commentarial voice...]

806
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:33,760
[…L先生这些内心独白的话外音时]
[...which tells the inner monologue of Mr. L.]

807
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:37,090
[我已经想好了最后一幕，那是在夜晚]
[I already have the last scene. It's night.]

808
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:40,380
[这位自打本书开始就遭受瘫痪折磨的L先生…]
[Mr. L, who was paralysed since the beginning of the piece...]

809
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:46,050
[…突然间从床上蹦起来，跑上灯光昏暗的舞台]
[...suddenly jumps out of his bed and runs over the darkly lit stage.]

810
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:51,970
[之后光线又暗下来，此时响起了L先生的话外音]
[Then it gets dark again and we hear Mr. L's commentarial voice:]

811
01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:53,760
[tmd，原来是个梦]
[Fuck, it was a dream.]

812
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,840
起来，你能站起来
Stand up. I can stand up.

813
01:18:27,090 --> 01:18:29,170
一切都会好起来
Everything is alright.

814
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:13,920
我想知道这一切是怎么发生的
'I want to remember how all this happened to me.'

815
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:15,920
要不要问问什么人？
Shall I ask someone?

816
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:23,340
不要？
No?

817
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:34,670
- 你好，这里是一一九房间  - 你是谁？
- Hello, room 119.  - Who's that?

818
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:41,000
我是克劳德·曼蒂毕，吉多在我身边
I'm Claude Mendibil. I'm sitting with Jean-Do.

819
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:43,290
[我是他父亲]
[This is his father speaking.]

820
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:45,840
我们正等您的电话呢
Yes, we were expecting your call.

821
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,920
我该怎么做？就是聊天吗？
So what do I do? Just talk?

822
01:19:54,050 --> 01:19:57,500
[吉多可以听到你，他会回答你的]
[Jean-Do can hear you. He will answer you.]

823
01:19:57,590 --> 01:20:01,340
[你可以听到我说字母表…]
[You'll hear me saying the alphabet and...]

824
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:03,340
我知道，席琳告诉过我
Yes, Cine told me.

825
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:10,000
[说吧，波比先生]
[Just talk, Monsieur Bauby.]

826
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:11,880
他能听到我吗？
Can he hear me?

827
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:17,500
吉恩-多米尼克，我是老豆
Jean-Dominique? This is Papinou.

828
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:24,250
[我现在坐在窗前]
[I'm sitting at the open window.]

829
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:30,290
[你好吗？是不是这个问题太傻了？]
[How are you or is that a fool question?]

830
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:45,500
对，是很傻
Yes, it's a fool question.

831
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:51,000
我好想你
I miss you.

832
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:08,130
[我也想你]
[I miss you, too.]

833
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:14,750
天啊！这样根本就不可能交谈
God Almighty! This is an impossible way to conduct a conversation.

834
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:19,870
我想说什么都不记得了，不，不，我想起来了
Everything goes out of my mind. No, no, I've remembered.

835
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:26,250
[我给你寄了个礼物，是给你的意外惊喜]
[I'm sending you a present. It's a surprise.]

836
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,500
[我想啊…]
[I had a thought...]

837
01:21:33,710 --> 01:21:37,870
…我们，我们现在的处境相同
...about us. We're in the same boat.

838
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:45,920
我被困在这公寓，不能起来，不能上下楼
I'm stuck in this apartment. I can't get up and down the stairs.

839
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:51,420
[不信的话，等你九十二岁的时候下四层楼梯试试]
[You try four flights of stairs when you're ninety-two years old.]

840
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:57,250
[我们都被困囚笼]
[we're both locked-in cases.]

841
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:02,670
[你被身体所困，而我则被这栋公寓所困]
[You in your body and me in my apartment.]

842
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:05,420
吉多，记住…
Jean-Dominique, remember,...

843
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:10,920
…我写字台右手边第一个抽屉里有封信…
...in the top right-hand drawer of my writing desk there's a letter..

844
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:17,170
里面是我的遗嘱…
In it are my last wishes. It's in a file...

845
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:25,080
…夹在标着“杂七杂八”标记的文件夹里
...marked 'Miscellaneous'.

846
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:32,040
[好了，不说了]
[I must stop now.]

847
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:50,910
- 别哭  - 可我就是控制不住
- Don't cry.  - That's easy to say.

848
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:54,160
你可是我的儿子啊
You're my son for Christ's sake.

849
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:57,370
再见，吉多
Good-bye, Jean-Dominique.

850
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:02,160
我差点忘了，你生日快到了
I forgot, it's almost your birthday.

851
01:23:03,830 --> 01:23:05,370
[我会再打给你的]
[I'll call again.]

852
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:09,250
[生日快乐]
[Happy Birthday.]

853
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:59,870
[知道听不到儿子的答复，这对一个父亲来说心如刀割]
[It can't be easy for a father to speak to a son who he knows will never reply.]

854
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:22,790
我觉得外出观景对你有好处
I thought an outing with a new vista would do you good.

855
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:28,330
还有个惊喜给你，闭上眼睛
I have another surprise for you. Close your eyes.

856
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:32,660
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

857
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:40,830
好了，现在睁开
Okay, now open them.

858
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:42,580
基督山伯爵
THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

859
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:46,950
[没必要这么破费，居然是两卷册的]
[That was not necessary. In two volumes.]

860
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:50,830
这并不是第一版，但是也很有年头了
It's not a first edition, but it's pretty old.

861
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:58,080
想不想叫我给你读一段？哪一章呢？
Would you like me to read something to you? Which chapter?

862
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:04,120
[我们应该用罗马数字，居然没有想到用罗马数字]
[We should use Roman digits. We didn't think of Roman digits.]

863
01:25:04,330 --> 01:25:06,830
[罗马数字是怎么编号的？]
[What would it be in Roman digits?]

864
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:10,990
[L，I，X]
[That's L, I, X.]

865
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:15,490
[那样就快多了，下次用罗马数字吧]
[That's faster. Next time.]

866
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:19,580
[- 五十？再往后？ - 对，再往后]
[- 50? Higher?  - Yes, higher.]

867
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:24,040
九？五十九？好的
Nine? 59? OK.

868
01:25:25,410 --> 01:25:27,990
好的，找到了
OK, there we go.

869
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:32,370
[里面居然有插画，我被这个巧合震惊了]
[There's even an illustration. The coincidence frightens me.]

870
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:35,830
他们在他旁边坐下
'They sat down beside him.'

871
01:25:36,950 --> 01:25:42,160
[诺瓦迪埃坐在被整日安置的轮椅上…]
['Noirtier was sitting in a wheelchair where they put him from morning till evening...]

872
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:46,410
[…面前的镜子令他不费吹灰之力…]
[...in front of a mirror which allowed him to see the whole apartment...]

873
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:48,200
[就看清整栋公寓]
[without attempting any movement:]

874
01:25:48,330 --> 01:25:50,700
这些如今对他来说已成为奢望
this was something that had become impossible for him.

875
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:54,990
视力和听觉是仅存的感官…
Sight and hearing were the only two senses...

876
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:59,330
…象两束火苗，依然在他胸膛燃烧
...which, like two sparks, still lit up this human matter.'

877
01:26:00,290 --> 01:26:03,330
…在他胸膛燃烧
'... this human matter.'

878
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:07,240
[那就是我，你觉得呢？]
[That's me, don't you think?]

879
01:26:08,410 --> 01:26:10,490
[- 不  - 是的]
[- But no.  - But yes.]

880
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:13,910
[人们被我吓跑，我令他们颤抖]
[I frighten people, make them shudder.]

881
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:16,330
不是的
You don't.

882
01:26:16,330 --> 01:26:19,740
[我不应该碰大仲马的作品]
[I should have stayed away from Dumas.]

883
01:26:19,990 --> 01:26:23,910
[不应该篡改名著，这就是教训]
[Don't tamper with a masterpiece. That's the lesson.]

884
01:26:25,830 --> 01:26:29,330
[我并不知道自己会成为诺瓦迪埃这样的人]
[I didn't know Noirtier was the man I was going to become.]

885
01:26:31,030 --> 01:26:34,990
[我的潜水钟将你同我一起拖至海底]
[My diving bell has dragged you down to the bottom of the sea with me..]

886
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:40,910
吉多，我并不介意你将我拖至海底…
Jean-Do, I don't find it so bad that you drag me down to the bottom of the sea...

887
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:43,830
…因为你同时也是我的多彩蝴蝶
...because you are also my butterfly.

888
01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:47,910
[这是爱的宣言]
[That's a declaration of love.]

889
01:26:49,780 --> 01:26:52,450
[等我们完成这本书…]
[After we finish this book...]

890
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:56,330
[…我们再继续合作下一本关于长跑运动员的书]
[...we'll write another one about a long-distance runner.]

891
01:26:56,530 --> 01:26:58,910
[也许有朝一日，我会成为他那样的人…]
[You never know. Perhaps I'll become like him...]

892
01:27:01,530 --> 01:27:04,240
斗牛比赛你没能来
'I missed you at the bullfight.

893
01:27:04,450 --> 01:27:07,910
希望明年能见，吉恩-保罗
I hope we meet again next year. Jean-Paul.'

894
01:27:07,990 --> 01:27:10,410
写于探戈，尼姆
Le Tango, Nimes.

895
01:27:21,330 --> 01:27:26,820
亲爱的波比先生，您定制的汽车…
'Dear Mr. Bauby, the customized campmobile...

896
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:34,330

...can be delivered six to eight weeks after your order.

897
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:37,910
亨利·雷纳德，这可是个好消息
Yours sincerely, Henri Raynaud.' That's good news.

898
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:42,990
这是老豆寄来的
This is from Papinou.

899
01:27:50,410 --> 01:27:52,280
是个礼物
'This is a present.'

900
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:58,320
看，你孩童时的照片
Look, a photo of you as a kid.

901
01:28:00,410 --> 01:28:02,990
吉多，八岁，摄于贝克海滨
Jean-Do, aged eight, Berck sur Mer.

902
01:28:07,450 --> 01:28:09,030
这是安娜·玛丽寄来的
From Anne-Marie.

903
01:28:13,410 --> 01:28:17,160
- 吉恩-多米尼克病房  - 你是哪位？
- Jean-Dominique Bauby's room.  - Who are you?

904
01:28:17,370 --> 01:28:19,570
席琳·戴斯毛利斯，你是哪位？
Cine Desmoulins. And you?

905
01:28:20,410 --> 01:28:25,070
[我是伊莱斯，我想和吉多说几句话]
[Elese. I want to speak with Jean-Do.]

906
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:28,200
等一下
One moment.

907
01:28:31,660 --> 01:28:34,660
我把扬声器打开，这样他就可以听到你了
I turned the speaker on, so he can hear you.

908
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:38,320
[你在那，我没法说]
[I can't speak with you there.]

909
01:28:38,490 --> 01:28:42,660
只能这样，这里没有别人了
You have to, there's no one else.

910
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:44,240
[医师也不在吗？]
[Isn't the therapist there?]

911
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:45,570
不，她今天不在
No, she's not here today.

912
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:55,910
[亲爱的？]
[Darling?]

913
01:28:58,820 --> 01:29:04,160
[我知道答应过去看你，可到了车站，我还是忍不住掉头回来]
[I know I said I'd come but I got as far as the train station and then turned back.]

914
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,820
[我实在是做不到]
[I just can't.]

915
01:29:07,990 --> 01:29:10,160
[请原谅我]
[Please forgive me.]

916

[席琳？]
[Cine?]

917
01:29:15,410 --> 01:29:16,200
什么事？
Yes.

918
01:29:16,410 --> 01:29:22,240
[你能不能出去一下？有些事我要单独和吉多讲]
[Can't you just go out for a moment? I have personal things to say.]

919
01:29:22,450 --> 01:29:23,820
[你在场我讲不出来]
[I feel embarrassed.]

920
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:25,070
我不能留下他一个
I can't leave him.

921
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:29,240
这里没有别人了，等下，他有话要说
There's nobody else. Wait, he wants to say something.

922
01:29:32,570 --> 01:29:34,030
O？
O?

923
01:29:38,410 --> 01:29:39,650
一？
One?

924
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:50,280
一分钟？
One minute?

925
01:29:50,490 --> 01:29:53,320
我出去了，但是一会儿就回来
I'm leaving. But not for long.

926
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:02,990
[吉多，你现在是一个人吗？]
[Jean-Do, are you alone now?]

927
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:08,070
[亲爱的…]
[Darling...]

928
01:30:09,450 --> 01:30:11,650
[我爱你胜于一切]
[I love you more than ever.]

929
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:16,740
[我想来看望你，不过我始终没有勇气]
[I want to see you but I haven't the courage.]

930
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:20,990
[我想在脑海中保留从前的你]
[I want to think of you as you were.]

931
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:25,150
[希望你早日康复]
[I hope you'll recover.]

932
01:30:27,490 --> 01:30:29,570
[我好想你]
[I miss you.]

933
01:30:30,070 --> 01:30:34,570
[我想念你，感觉好孤独]
[I miss you and I feel so alone.]

934
01:30:36,110 --> 01:30:38,490
[我知道你能明白]
[I know you understand.]

935
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:44,150
[我无时无刻不在想着你]
[You're in my thoughts all the time.]

936
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:54,990
[我知道你的家人时刻和你在一起]
[I know your family is always with you.]

937
01:31:00,150 --> 01:31:02,150
[你想叫我来看望吗？]
[Do you want me to come?]

938
01:31:03,490 --> 01:31:04,240
我回来了
I'm back.

939
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:06,110
[你想叫我来看望吗？]
[Do you want me to come?]

940
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,900
[你想叫我来看望吗？]
[Do you want me to come?]

941
01:31:08,900 --> 01:31:10,820
我回来了，伊莱斯
I'm back, Elese.

942
01:31:43,610 --> 01:31:44,980
每…
Every...

943
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:03,820
每时每刻
Every day.

944
01:32:20,980 --> 01:32:22,780
每时每刻我…
Every day I'm...

945
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:47,230
每时每刻我都在等你
Every day I'm waiting for you.

946
01:32:47,570 --> 01:32:50,070
[我听不清，能再重复一下吗？]
[I can't understand you. Could you repeat that?]

947
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:52,650
[我听不清]
[I can't understand you.]

948
01:32:55,150 --> 01:32:57,900
他说：我每时每刻都在等你
He said: I'm waiting for you every day.

949
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:11,310
要是不搭乘这趟航班，我就赶不上去香港了
If I don't get a seat on this plane, I will miss my connection to Hong-Kong.

950
01:34:14,730 --> 01:34:17,560
那我的位子让给你好了
Take mine.

951
01:34:17,980 --> 01:34:21,110
- 我坐下班飞机  - 谢谢
- I'll take the next flight.  - Thank you.

952
01:34:22,070 --> 01:34:23,400
旅途愉快
Have a good trip.

953
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:31,810
但是你这可不是去香港啊，你会去贝鲁特
But you're not going to Hong Kong you are going to Beirut.

954
01:34:44,730 --> 01:34:47,650
怎么了？不舒服吗？
Anything wrong? You don't feel good?

955
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:50,480
没事的
Don't worry.

956
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:00,810
[大多数时候，我都会忘记梦境]
[Most times I forget my dreams.]

957
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:04,150
[给你说梦的人都极其无聊]
[People who tell you their dreams are tiresome.]

958
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:08,900
[但是这个梦却不断的出现，我还搞不清究竟为何]
[But this one comes again and again. I don't know why.]

959
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:11,650
[我好害怕]
[I'm afraid.]

960
01:35:12,650 --> 01:35:16,520
[这种厄运的感觉挥之不去]
[The feeling of doom wouldn't leave.]

961
01:35:16,730 --> 01:35:20,900
[只有被称之为“奇迹”的东西，才能拯救我的灵魂]
[It took what I can only describe as a miracle to lift my spirits.]

962
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:26,100
[崇尚个人奇迹是危险的]
[It's dangerous to believe in personal miracles.]

963
01:35:26,230 --> 01:35:28,400
[这让人妄自尊大]
[They tend to make one feel self-important.]

964
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:34,150
[但是，我得承认，奇迹确实发生了]
[Nevertheless, I must report that I believe something miraculous did occur]

965
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:37,650
[我开始能唱歌了]
[I began to sing.]

966
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:42,060
[我咕哝，我唱歌]
[I grunt, I sing.]

967
01:35:43,310 --> 01:35:47,350
[我的听力不大灵光，有时候我却可以听到自己的心跳]
[My hearing isn't great and sometimes I think I hear my heart beating.]

968
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:50,980
[但是我告诉自己，那是蝴蝶扇动羽翼的声音]
[But I tell myself it's the sound of butterfly's wings.]

969
01:35:51,230 --> 01:35:55,900
[是的，我们不屈不挠的前进着，我甚至有可能拥有蝴蝶的听觉]
[Yes, I am making indomitable progress and I may even have butterfly hearing.]

970
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:59,980
[我也可以展望未来，夏天即将结束…]
[I can look forward to the future. Soon the summer will come to an end...]

971
01:36:00,150 --> 01:36:03,060
[…我将要开始在医院的第一个秋季生活]
[...and I will begin my first autumn in this hospital.]

972
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:06,730
[这里就是我的生活]
[My life is here.]

973
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:09,560
[周而复始的循环]
[An everlasting repetition.]

974
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:12,480
[就在这里]
[Here.]

975
01:36:13,390 --> 01:36:15,390
你好吗？
How goes it?

976
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:18,310
他说话了
He's speaking!

977
01:36:19,310 --> 01:36:22,230
- 你在说话  - 他还会唱歌呢
- You're speaking.  - He can sing a song, too.

978
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:27,480
- 来，给劳伦唱一个  - 快点，给我唱一个
- Come on, sing for Laurent.  - Please, for me.

979
01:36:46,390 --> 01:36:48,310
你还好吗？
Are you OK?

980
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:51,100
- 他是在唱歌吗？ - 不，不是
- Does he sing?  - No, he doesn't.

981
01:37:10,810 --> 01:37:12,230
[我得了肺炎]
[I have pneumonia.]

982
01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:17,560
[就在我刚刚幻想…]
[Just when I thought...]

983
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:35,270
[就好像水手注视着渐渐消逝的海岸一样]
[Like a sailor who watches the shore gradually disappear.]

984
01:37:35,390 --> 01:37:37,140
[我注视着过去的自己一点点消失]
[I watch my past recede.]

985
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:41,390
[逐渐被遗忘]
[Becoming ashes of oblivion.]

986
01:37:57,230 --> 01:37:59,020
[我这真是衣锦还乡啊…]
[What a comeback.]

987
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,100
[那里是我工作的地方]
[That's where I worked.]

988
01:38:01,230 --> 01:38:05,390
[那对夫妇，我认识，但是却不记得他们的名字]
[And that couple, I know them, but I can't remember their names.]

989
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:08,810
[那是我的车！]
[That's my car!]

990
01:38:09,430 --> 01:38:11,390
[我的新车]
[My new car.]

991
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:29,010
喇叭在哪里？
Where is the horn?

992
01:40:13,470 --> 01:40:16,640
- 让我抱一下  - 看到我的新车了吗？
- Let me hug you.  - See my car?

993
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:18,600
太酷了！
Lovely.

994
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:23,310
一切都还好吗，西奥？
Everything OK, Theo?

995
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:25,680
这周过的还不错吧
Had a good week?

996
01:40:25,970 --> 01:40:30,810
- 我们要去看戏吗？ - 看戏？只要你想去
- Are we going to a theatre?  - To a theatre? If you want to.

997
01:40:30,970 --> 01:40:34,970
- 能吃牡蛎吗？ - 你现在喜欢牡蛎了？
- Can we have oysters?  - Do you like oysters now?

998
01:40:39,970 --> 01:40:42,050
别太晚送他回来
Don't bring him back too late.

999
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:46,640
我们走了
We are leaving.

1000
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:52,470
- 我能坐前排吗？ - 当然了，后面也没座啊
- Can I get in the front?  - Sure, there's no room in the back.

1001
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:02,550
过一段我也带你出去玩
Soon I will take you too.

1002
01:41:03,180 --> 01:41:05,680
是不是感觉有风吹？
A little bit of wind?

1003
01:41:19,430 --> 01:41:23,180
- 你们球队还好吗？ - 嗯，队员们都还不错
- Your team OK?  - Yeah, the players are OK.

1004
01:41:23,390 --> 01:41:29,720
- 训练之后你们冲澡吗？ - 冲，还洗衣服什么的
- You take a shower afterwards?  - We shower and wash our stuff.

1005
01:41:29,970 --> 01:41:33,800
- 你的蛋蛋长头发了吗？ - 还没
- Got pubic hair around your willy?  - No, not yet.

1006
01:41:34,010 --> 01:41:39,720
我们队里以前有个家伙不肯脱衣服冲澡
We had one guy who didn't want to undress for the shower.

1007
01:41:39,970 --> 01:41:45,550
俱乐部就强迫他，还打了一架
The club said he had to. There was a fight.

1008
01:41:46,510 --> 01:41:51,510
可他还是不肯，后来她妈来劝他
He didn't do it. His mother appeased him.

1009
01:41:52,220 --> 01:41:56,390
最后，他就离开球队了
In the end, he had to leave the team.

1010
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:03,720
你们没有这样的问题？
You don't have that problem, do you?

1011
01:42:07,470 --> 01:42:11,390
- 还有什么新闻？妈妈还好吗？ - 挺好的
- Other news? Everything OK with mom?  - Yeah, she's OK.

1012
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:15,470
- 你认识这条路吗？ - 认识，去黛安娜阿姨家就从这走
- You know this way?  - Yes, it's the way to Aunt Diane.

1013
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:19,300
很热，是不是？
It's hot. You feel that, too?

1014
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,970
我没觉得啊
No, I don't.

1015
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,300
我们…
We have...

1016
01:42:30,050 --> 01:42:31,800
我们…
We have...

1017
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:47,880
可能要下雨了，我要停一下车
It might start to rain. I'll stop for a moment.

1018
01:43:05,050 --> 01:43:07,550
爸，怎么了？
Dad, what's the matter?

1019
01:44:00,130 --> 01:44:02,340
给你妈妈打电话！
Phone your mother!

1020
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:09,010
我最后想的是我们要取消看戏的计划
My last thought was we'll have to cancel going to the theatre.

1021
01:44:09,130 --> 01:44:14,420
肯定晚了，不过我们明晚会去
We'd be late in any case. We'll go tomorrow night.

1022
01:44:15,470 --> 01:44:17,760
之后我就陷入了无尽的昏迷
And then I sank into a coma.

1023
01:44:57,760 --> 01:44:59,960
是本书吗？
Is it a book?

1024
01:45:10,550 --> 01:45:13,710
献给西奥菲勒，席莱斯特和霍顿斯
For Theophile, Cileicester and Hortense.

1025
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:17,130
我希望他们的生活充满多彩的蝴蝶
I wish them lots of butterflies.

1026
01:45:19,710 --> 01:45:22,460
衷心的感谢克劳德·曼蒂毕
And my deepest gratitude to Claude Mendibil.

1027
01:45:22,630 --> 01:45:28,050
没有她，就不会有这本书的出版
You'll understand that without her this book couldn't have been written.

1028
01:46:00,130 --> 01:46:01,710
我一直在你身边
I was here the whole time.

1029
01:46:02,210 --> 01:46:03,590
你知道的
You know that.

1030
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:10,130
这些评论棒极了！想不想听听？
These reviews are terrific! You want to hear them?

1031
01:46:10,380 --> 01:46:14,550
作者在寂静中口述，没有手势，没有言语
The man who dictates in silence. Without gestures or speech.

1032
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:19,960
