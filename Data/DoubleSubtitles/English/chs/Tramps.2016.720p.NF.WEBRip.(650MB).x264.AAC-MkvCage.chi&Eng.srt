223
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,488
我跟一个瑞奇一起住
{\fscx73\fscy77}I live with a Ricky.

224
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,241
一个瑞奇是什么？
{\fscx73\fscy77}What's a Ricky?

225
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,747
我以前养过一条蜥蜴 就叫瑞奇
{\fscx73\fscy77}I had a lizard named Ricky once.

226
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,750
听起来很合适
{\fscx73\fscy77}Sounds about right.

227
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,882
走吧 等办好了就行了
{\fscx73\fscy77}Come on, you'll be done when it's done.

228
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,394
（奥西宁村）

229
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,691
你觉得谁会住在这里？
{\fscx73\fscy77}Who do you think lives out here?

230
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,109
有钱人
{\fscx73\fscy77}Rich people.

231
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:47,115
你觉得这里的房子要多少钱？
{\fscx73\fscy77}So, how much do you think these houses cost?

232
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,619
-怎么？你要买房子吗？ -不是
{\fscx73\fscy77}-Why? You in the market? -Oh, no.

233
00:22:56,208 --> 00:23:00,545
萨克拉门托呢？你去过吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}What about, uh, Sacramento? You ever been there?

234
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,547
没有 谢天谢地
{\fscx73\fscy77}No, thank God.

235
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,217
那里有个工作机会
{\fscx73\fscy77}There's a job opening there.

236
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,803
因为我是个厨师
{\fscx73\fscy77}'Cause I'm a chef, you know?

237
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,222
在城里一个很不错的餐馆里
{\fscx73\fscy77}At a nice restaurant in the city.

238
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,058
你知道“农场到餐桌”吧？
{\fscx73\fscy77}You know what "farm to table" is, right?

239
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,853
其实我更像个厨子
{\fscx73\fscy77}I'm more of a cook, I guess.

240
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,648
知道了 随便 但你不用离开纽约
{\fscx73\fscy77}Okay, sure, whatever, but you don't have to leave New York.

241
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,192
我知道 但…
{\fscx73\fscy77}Yeah, I know, but...

242
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,778
我的生活条件并不好
{\fscx73\fscy77}my living situation's not great.

243
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,364
好吧 但到处都有餐馆
{\fscx73\fscy77}Fine, but there's restaurants everywhere.

244
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,324
这倒没错
{\fscx73\fscy77}That's true.

245
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,409
你呢？你是做什么的？
{\fscx73\fscy77}So what about you? What do you do?

246
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,914
-我最近没工作 -真的吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}-I'm recently unemployed. -Oh, really?

247
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,499
你以前做什么的？
{\fscx73\fscy77}What did you do?

248
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,002
我之前是个酒保
{\fscx73\fscy77}I-- I was a bartender.

249
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,589
但我会做很棒的鸡尾酒
{\fscx73\fscy77}But I made-- I made, like, fancy cocktails.

250
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:48,426
不错 我有个朋友勒夫 我们是高中同学
{\fscx73\fscy77}That's cool. I got this friend Lev that I went to high school with,

251
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,930
他是市里一家酒吧的 调酒师助理 他…
{\fscx73\fscy77}he-- he's a bar-back in the city at this bar and he's just like...

252
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,015
他最喜欢调的酒是蛋白…
{\fscx73\fscy77}His favorite drink to make is, like, these egg whites--

253
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,269
行了 我没做过酒保 我在脱衣舞俱乐部工作过
{\fscx73\fscy77}Look, I wasn't a bartender, okay? I worked in a strip club.

254
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,857
好吧…
{\fscx73\fscy77}All right. Okay.

255
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,986
你肯定做得很成功
{\fscx73\fscy77}I bet you were successful at that, you know.

256
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,822
-这话什么意思？ -没什么 只是…
{\fscx73\fscy77}-What the fuck's that supposed to mean? -Nothing, just 'cause--

257
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,825
你又漂亮又聪明 还…
{\fscx73\fscy77}You're pretty and you're smart, and...

258
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,370
我不成功
{\fscx73\fscy77}Well, I wasn't.

259
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:19,374
我只是个服务员 我不跳脱衣舞或在后面工作
{\fscx73\fscy77}And I was only a waitress, okay? I didn't strip or work the back.

260
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:22,210
-好吧 -我是认真的 我不陪睡
{\fscx73\fscy77}-All right. -I'm serious. I don't sleep around.

261
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,589
-你不信我吗？ -我信
{\fscx73\fscy77}-What, you don't believe me? -I believe you.

262
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,883
-你猜我跟多少人睡过 -这不重要
{\fscx73\fscy77}-Guess how many guys I've slept with. -It doesn't matter--

263
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,468
-不 你猜猜看 -我不猜 这太傻了
{\fscx73\fscy77}-No, no. Guess. -I'm not guessing, that's stupid.

264
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,137
-我不会猜的 -七个
{\fscx73\fscy77}-I'm not gonna guess. -Seven.

265
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,139
-好吧 -不多
{\fscx73\fscy77}-Okay. -It's not a lot.

266
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,933
不多 我可能还会说得更多
{\fscx73\fscy77}It's not a lot. I probably would've said higher.

267
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,685
你现在想说我看着像妓女吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}Oh, so you're saying I look like a whore now?

268
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,353
不是 我…
{\fscx73\fscy77}No! I just...

269
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,606
我…即使你跟一百个人睡过
{\fscx73\fscy77}I just-- I wouldn't even think you were a whore

270
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,275
我都不会觉得你是妓女
{\fscx73\fscy77}if you slept with, like, a hundred guys.

271
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,780
说得没错
{\fscx73\fscy77}Yeah, exactly.

272
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,742
-你算老几？还评判我 -我没有评判你
{\fscx73\fscy77}-Who are you to judge me? -I'm not judging you.

273
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,786
所以我才不想猜
{\fscx73\fscy77}That's why I don't wanna guess.

274
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,474
我们迷路了
{\fscx73\fscy77}We're lost.

275
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,269
-不应该 -我之前见过那栋房子
{\fscx73\fscy77}-Uh, we shouldn't be. -No, I've seen that house before.

276
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:26,274
不一定 说不定你小时候来过这里
{\fscx73\fscy77}I don't know. Maybe you were here when you were a kid.

277
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:38,745
如果刚才左拐对了 那这就是玛丽艾斯路
{\fscx73\fscy77}You know, if that was the right left, then this is Maryasis.

278
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:41,539
如果他们树个路标 我们就能知道了
{\fscx73\fscy77}If they put up a fuckin' street sign we'd be able to tell.

279
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:45,293
-你干什么？ -找地址看看
{\fscx73\fscy77}-Hey, what are you doing? -Looking for an address.

280
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,462
不…你不能这样 这是联邦犯罪
{\fscx73\fscy77}No, no, you can't do this, it's a federal crime.

281
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,297
好吧 反正我有同伙
{\fscx73\fscy77}Yeah, well, I got an accomplice.

282
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,091
就是这条街
{\fscx73\fscy77}Look, it is the right street.

283
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,801
快放回去
{\fscx73\fscy77}Put it away.

284
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,135
需要帮忙吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}Can I help you?

285
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,347
-你好 你住这里吗？ -不
{\fscx73\fscy77}-Hey. Um, do you live here? -I do not.

286
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:00,558
-我们也是 -不
{\fscx73\fscy77}-Neither do we. -No.

287
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,394
你们看起来不像库蒂考夫家的人
{\fscx73\fscy77}You don't look much like the Kutikoffs.

288
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:07,649
库蒂考夫  是  我们应该…
{\fscx73\fscy77}The Kutiko-- Yeah, uh-- We're supposed to just, you know...

289
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:10,527
-他们…我们… -我们迷路了
{\fscx73\fscy77}-They're-- We're just... -We're just a little lost.

290
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,779
-我们迷路了 -没错
{\fscx73\fscy77}-We're just a little lost. -That's it.

291
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:15,407
知道我迷路时怎么做吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}You know what I do when I'm lost?

292
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,492
我会报警 要我帮你们报警吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}I call the police. Shall I call them for you?

293
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:19,911
-不用 -不用 谢谢 我们要走了
{\fscx73\fscy77}-No, no. -No, thanks. We're just gonna leave.

294
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,580
-谢谢 -好主意
{\fscx73\fscy77}-Thank you. -[man] Good idea.

295
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,707
抱歉
{\fscx73\fscy77}Sorry.

296
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,834
没事 他开的是越野
{\fscx73\fscy77}Don't worry about it. He's driving a fucking SUV.

297
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,670
-什么意思？ -他是个混蛋
{\fscx73\fscy77}-What does that mean? -He's an asshole.

298
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,543
家里好像没人
{\fscx73\fscy77}I don't think anyone's home.

299
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:14,132
在客厅里 不要让狗跑出来
{\fscx73\fscy77}Hey. It's in the living room. Don't let the dog out.

300
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:20,013
Uh...

301
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:24,184
-是她拿走了那个包吗？ -不是 这个更年轻
{\fscx73\fscy77}-Is that the girl that took the bag? -No, no. This girl is younger.

302
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,606
看看吧
{\fscx73\fscy77}Uh, I guess.

303
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,174
我觉得她说的不是我们的箱子
{\fscx73\fscy77}I don't think she's talking about the briefcase.

304
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,885
我们得找她问问
{\fscx73\fscy77}I think we just have to find her and ask her.

305
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,429
对 我们去找她
{\fscx73\fscy77}Yeah. Yeah, let's do that.

306
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,186
有人吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}Hello?

307
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:16,736
有人吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}Hello?

308
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,292
快看 是个瑞奇
{\fscx73\fscy77}Hey, look, it's a Ricky.

309
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,880
天啊 快看
{\fscx73\fscy77}Oh, my God, check it out.

310
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,550
这条蜥蜴真大
{\fscx73\fscy77}That's a big lizard.

311
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,891
我不懂他们为什么给孩子 活不久的宠物
{\fscx73\fscy77}I don't know why they give kids pets that die so young.

312
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:53,982
可能想让他们在遇到真正伤心的事前 先小小地伤心一下
{\fscx73\fscy77}Maybe let 'em be sad about something small before the really sad things happen.

313
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,494
来吧
{\fscx73\fscy77}Come on.

314
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,124
而且蜥蜴的寿命很长的
{\fscx73\fscy77}And, you know, lizards have a really long lifespan.

315
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,584
有20年
{\fscx73\fscy77}Like, 20 years.

316
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,335
那瑞奇怎么了？
{\fscx73\fscy77}So what happened to Ricky?

317
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:21,009
它的生活条件也不太好
{\fscx73\fscy77}Uh, well, his living situation wasn't exactly ideal either.

318
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,137
谁的好？
{\fscx73\fscy77}-Ya know. -Whose is?

{\fscx73\fscy77}-Where is she? -Yeah, and where's the dog?

324
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,007
快看 有人回家了
{\fscx73\fscy77}Hey, look, someone's coming home.

325
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,219
我觉得那是…开越野的那个人
{\fscx73\fscy77}I think that-- That's the guy with the SUV.

326
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,887
什么？
{\fscx73\fscy77}What?

{\fscx73\fscy77}-[whispers] We gotta jump. -What?

330
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,089
我们得跳下去
{\fscx73\fscy77}[whispers] We gotta jump.

331
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,640
没问题的
{\fscx73\fscy77}[softly] We got this, okay?

332
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,312

{\fscx73\fscy77}Come on.

335
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,760
我们没把狗放出来
{\fscx73\fscy77}We didn't let the dog out.

336
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:45,570
这样吧 我再回去一趟
{\fscx73\fscy77}You know what? Look, I'm going back up there.

337
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,322
我要回去一趟
{\fscx73\fscy77}I'm going back up there.

338
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,282
我要跟他们解释 你拿着我的身份证
{\fscx73\fscy77}I'm going to explain to them. Take my ID.

339
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:51,075
如果我被捕 我要告诉他们一个假名
{\fscx73\fscy77}If I get arrested I'm gonna give a false name.

340
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,786
名字不是问题 他们家一半的人见过你
{\fscx73\fscy77}The name isn't the problem, you've been seen by half the family.

341
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,456
我们等到他们早上出门吧
{\fscx73\fscy77}Let's just wait till they go in the morning.

342
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,875
女主人可能把箱子放在里面了 我们进去拿了走
{\fscx73\fscy77}The wife will probably leave the briefcase inside, we'll go in and get it.

343
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:02,086
-如果不在呢？ -那我们就走 好吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}-And what if it's not there? -Then we'll leave, all right?

344
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,880
我们等到明天看看
{\fscx73\fscy77}We just got to wait and see.

345
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,968
对不起 是我搞砸了
{\fscx73\fscy77}Look, I'm sorry, all right? I screwed up.

346
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:12,221
是我的错 我放弃我的那份 好吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}It's my fault. I'm gonna forfeit my share, okay?

347
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,224
-但我不能整晚留在这里 -你必须留下
{\fscx73\fscy77}-But I can't stay here the whole night. -No, you have to.

348
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,019
为什么？说真的 你应该跟我一起走
{\fscx73\fscy77}Why? Why? And honestly, you should come with me.

349
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,562
我们应该让他们来处理
{\fscx73\fscy77}We should let them deal with this.

350
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,940
这是他们的问题 这跟我们无关
{\fscx73\fscy77}This is-- This is their problem. This has nothing to do with us.

351
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,776
除非你知道 一个破产的人怎么赚到足够的钱
{\fscx73\fscy77}Unless you know how someone who's broke can make enough money

352
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,946
摆脱自己的糟糕处境 否则我就留下
{\fscx73\fscy77}to get out of a shitty situation, then it's worth it to me.

353
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,410
你要用赚的钱离开那个人吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}Are you using the money to get away from that guy?

354
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,790
是的 行了吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}Yes, okay?

355
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,461
我要用这笔钱离开匹兹堡
{\fscx73\fscy77}I'm using the money to leave Pittsburgh.

356
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,009
好
{\fscx73\fscy77}Okay.

357
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,402
对了
{\fscx73\fscy77}Hey, uh...

358
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,196
刚才你做得很好
{\fscx73\fscy77}good job back there.

359
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:13,908
没有把狗放出来什么的
{\fscx73\fscy77}You know, from not letting the dog out and stuff.

360
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,581
（汽车旅馆）

361
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,391
-你要点东西吗？ -当然
{\fscx73\fscy77}-You gonna order something? -Yeah, sure.

362
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:41,060
9块钱能点什么？
{\fscx73\fscy77}Um, what can we get for nine dollars?

363
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,687
包括小费吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}Is that including tip?

364
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,772
是的
{\fscx73\fscy77}Sure.

365
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,488
能借用一下你的手机吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}Can I use your phone?

366
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,211
-这里是语音信箱 机主是… -斯科特
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>-You have reached the voice mailbox of... -Scott.</i>

367
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:10,089
请在滴声后留言
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>-Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

368
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,424
是我
{\fscx73\fscy77}Hey, it's me.

369
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,385
我们没事 正在办 但耽搁了
{\fscx73\fscy77}We're fine, we're on it but we got delayed.

370
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:17,180
所以等明天才能办好
{\fscx73\fscy77}So it won't be going down till tomorrow.

371
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,227
对 我们早上会去汽车旅馆
{\fscx73\fscy77}So, yeah, we'll be at the motel in the morning.

372
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,232
-他怎么说？ -他没接电话
{\fscx73\fscy77}-[Danny] So what'd he say? -Couldn't reach him.

373
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,151
好 我们吃点东西吧
{\fscx73\fscy77}All right, look, let's get some food.

374
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,612
你想吃吗？我想 我快饿死了
{\fscx73\fscy77}You need food? I need food, I'm starving.

375
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,614
-好吗？ -好
{\fscx73\fscy77}-Yeah? -All right, yeah.

376
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:37,158
儿童餐还是开胃菜？
{\fscx73\fscy77}Kids' menu or appetizers?

377
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,522
你呢？你有室友或女朋友吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>So what about you? You got a roommate, girlfriend?</i>

378
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:11,859
去年我跟我们楼一个女孩约会过
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>Well, I was-- I was seeing this girl in my building last year.</i>

379
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:16,155
真的吗？嘴唇上 带着你的小胡子和她约会吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>Oh, really? With that little hair thing above your lip?</i>

380
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,200
我的小胡子怎么了？
{\fscx73\fscy77}What's wrong with my mustache?

381
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,120
好吧 还有谁？
{\fscx73\fscy77}All right, who else?

382
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:27,125
-我不想跟你说这个 -拜托 和我说说吧
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>I don't wanna talk about this with you. -Come on, give me something.</i>

383
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,966
达伦情况很糟？
{\fscx73\fscy77}Very bad for Darren?

384
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,553
妈妈 我的情况也可能很糟
{\fscx73\fscy77}Ma, it could be very bad for me.

385
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,142
高中呢？
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>What about high school?</i>

386
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:48,563
走廊勾搭小女生？楼道里动手动脚？
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>Some scandalous hallway hookups? Some stairway action?</i>

387
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,189
好吧
{\fscx73\fscy77}All right.

388
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,025
丽贝卡瓦加斯 她在十年级时碰了我的鸡鸡
{\fscx73\fscy77}Rebecca Vargas. She touched my penis in tenth grade.

389
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:56,028
-丽贝卡瓦加斯？ -对 丽贝卡瓦加斯
{\fscx73\fscy77}-Wow. Rebecca Vargas? -Yeah, Rebecca Vargas.

390
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,823
当时丽贝卡瓦加斯…天啊
{\fscx73\fscy77}Rebecca Vargas back then... Oh, my God, man.

391
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,534
不过我不知道算不算
{\fscx73\fscy77}Ohh. I don't know if it counts, though.

392
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,536
-为什么不算？ -这…
{\fscx73\fscy77}-<i>Why wouldn't it count? -Well...</i>

393
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,831
好吧 我一个朋友迈克布达宾
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>All right. Mike Budabin, a friend of mine,</i>

394
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,041
他告诉大家 谁先让丽贝卡瓦加斯
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>he told everyone that whoever got Rebecca Vargas</i>

395
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,336
碰了自己的鸡鸡 谁就赢得“特别奖”
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>to touch their penis first, wins the "Special Prize."</i>

396
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,005
什么特别奖？
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>What was the Special Prize?</i>

397
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,923
就是让丽贝卡瓦加斯碰你的鸡鸡
{\fscx73\fscy77}It was having Rebecca Vargas touch your penis.

398
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,259
-有道理 -对
{\fscx73\fscy77}-Makes sense. -Right.

399
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:21,846
总之 她知道了奖跟自己有关
{\fscx73\fscy77}Anyway, she found out about this prize being associated with her

400
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,639
所以想知道到底是什么
{\fscx73\fscy77}and she wanted to know what it was.

401
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:27,560
所以她问了我 我说会告诉她 但是…
{\fscx73\fscy77}And so she asked me, and I said that I would tell her, but...

402
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,228
她必须先碰我的鸡鸡
{\fscx73\fscy77}she had to touch my penis first.

403
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,982
所以她用小指轻轻碰了
{\fscx73\fscy77}So she tapped it with her pinky and...

404
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,068
所以我就赢到了特别奖
{\fscx73\fscy77}that's how I won the Special Prize.

405
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,906
（趣味游戏）

406
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,993
丹尼尔 快点回家
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>Daniel, just come home now.</i>

407
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:48,289
你要做晚餐 赌马的人明天一大早就来
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>You'll make supper, and the bettors are coming early tomorrow.</i>

408
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:54,295
我们应该让达伦处理的
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>We should just let Darren handle it.</i>

409
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,927
对
{\fscx73\fscy77}Yeah.

410
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,345
丹尼尔？
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>Daniel?</i>

411
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,513
我要留下过夜
{\fscx73\fscy77}I'm gonna stay.

412
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,141
丹尼尔…喂？
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>Daniel? Daniel? Hello?</i>

413
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,520
谢谢
{\fscx73\fscy77}Thank you.

414
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,365
我不知道这是我听过的最甜蜜的故事
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>I don't know if that's the sweetest or saddest story</i>

415
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,658
还是最悲伤的故事
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>I've ever heard in my life.</i>

416
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,285
不 是最甜蜜的…
{\fscx73\fscy77}No, no, no, it's the sweetest. It's the sweetest.

417
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,830
说明一下 算数的
{\fscx73\fscy77}For the record, it counts.

418
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,750
-真的吗？ -当然了
{\fscx73\fscy77}-Really? -Yeah, of course.

419
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,253
她都碰你的鸡鸡了 对吧？
{\fscx73\fscy77}I mean, she touched your penis, right?

420
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,813
（缤纷滑梯）

421
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,822
（打星星）

422
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,631
（嘉年华）

423
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,765
你不觉得我们该睡在林子里吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}You don't think that we should just sleep in the woods?

424
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,976
我才不睡林子里
{\fscx73\fscy77}I am not sleeping in the woods.

425
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:35,271
-如果有警报呢？ -泳池边的小屋吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}-What if this is alarmed? -The pool shed?

426
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,483
-我不知道 -不用担心 没有警报
{\fscx73\fscy77}-I don't know. -Don't worry. It's not alarmed.

427
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,820
来吧 享受生活
{\fscx73\fscy77}Just come on. Live a little.

428
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,162
所以他最后上了法庭
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>So he ends up going to court</i>

429
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,664
他在法庭上说:“那是鬼魂”
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>and he was in the courtroom going "It was a ghost."</i>

430
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:57,418
法官就说:“我知道那鬼魂 我见过”
{\fscx73\fscy77}And the judge is like, "I know the ghost. I've seen it."

431
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,502
他就被无罪释放了
{\fscx73\fscy77}So he got off.

432
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,047
Whoa.

433
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,009
话说你都烹饪什么？
{\fscx73\fscy77}So, what do you cook?

434
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,762
什么都烹饪
{\fscx73\fscy77}Everything.

435
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,638
我是说在餐馆里
{\fscx73\fscy77}-I mean, at the restaurant. -Oh. Um...

436
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,559
那是个很不错的意大利餐馆
{\fscx73\fscy77}It's, uh, it's a nice little Italian place.

437
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,439
你去过吗？意大利？
{\fscx73\fscy77}You ever been there? To Italy?

438
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,983
没有…
{\fscx73\fscy77}No. No.

439
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:25,363
我只去过普罗维登斯
{\fscx73\fscy77}I mean, the only place I've ever been is Providence.

440
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:28,407
你就应该去那里
{\fscx73\fscy77}Well, that's where you should go.

441
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,867
忘记萨克拉门托吧
{\fscx73\fscy77}Forget Sacramento.

442
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,244
好
{\fscx73\fscy77}Yeah.

443
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,790
我去过一次
{\fscx73\fscy77}I've been there once.

444
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,666
-是吗？ -去过意大利
{\fscx73\fscy77}-[Danny] You have? -To Italy, yeah.

445
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:42,338
你跟家人还是谁一起去的吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}Wow. Did you go with your family or something?

446
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,507
不是
{\fscx73\fscy77}No.

447
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,514
-抱歉 我不… -没事
{\fscx73\fscy77}-I'm sorry, I didn't... -Don't be sorry.

448
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,309
你喜欢那里吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}Do you like it there?

449
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,145
应该吧
{\fscx73\fscy77}Yeah, I guess.

450
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:03,025
当你不把自己当游客 你会发现意大利有很多不可靠的人
{\fscx73\fscy77}Italy has a lot of shady people once you get past all the tourist stuff.

451
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,151
这样
{\fscx73\fscy77}Right.

452
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:10,449
你没想过 可能不是那个地方不可靠
{\fscx73\fscy77}You don't ever think that maybe it's-- it's not the place that's shady,

453
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,827
而是你选择打交道的人不可靠吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}it's the people you're choosing to hang out with.

454
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,459
你不如周末先去个 普罗维登斯之外的地方
{\fscx73\fscy77}You know, why don't you go somewhere else besides Providence for the weekend

455
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,795
然后再表现出一副无所不知的样子
{\fscx73\fscy77}before you start acting like you know everything.

456
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:30,928
-抱歉 -不…没事
{\fscx73\fscy77}-I'm sorry. -No, it's-- No, no, it's okay.

457
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,016
我就是太冷了
{\fscx73\fscy77}I'm just cold.

458
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:46,318
如果你冷 我们可以抱在一起
{\fscx73\fscy77}You know, if-- if you are cold, we could-- we could hold each other.

459
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,903
什么？
{\fscx73\fscy77}Excuse me?

460
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,449
我们可以抱在一起取暖
{\fscx73\fscy77}You know, we could hold each other for warmth.

461
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:53,492
你想抱我吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}You wanna cuddle me?

462
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:59,081
这是天气学事实 我不是想…
{\fscx73\fscy77}Look, it's a meteorical fact. I'm not, you know.

463
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,875
是气象学
{\fscx73\fscy77}Meteorological.

464
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,210
我就是这个意思
{\fscx73\fscy77}That's what I meant.

465
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:09,550
如果你不老实 我发誓你一定会后悔
{\fscx73\fscy77}If you try anything, I swear to God you're gonna fuckin' regret it.

466
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:13,095
不会 我有点怕你 所以我不会…
{\fscx73\fscy77}No, I'm-- I'm a little scared of you, so I'm not...

467
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,019
好
{\fscx73\fscy77}Okay.

468
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,438
好吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}Yeah?

469
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:35,242
我们只是抱在一起取暖
{\fscx73\fscy77}We're only cuddling for warmth.

470
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,162
对 因为天气原因抱在一起
{\fscx73\fscy77}Yeah. Cuddling for weather purposes.

471
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:55,346
是我 我们没事 正在办 但耽搁了
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>Hey, it's me. We're fine. We're on it, but we got delayed.</i>

472
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,681
所以等明天才能办好
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>So it won't be going down till tomorrow.</i>

473
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,352
我们早上会去汽车旅馆
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>So, yeah. We'll be at the motel in the morning.</i>

474
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,650
是艾莉的留言 一切都好
{\fscx73\fscy77}So that was Ellie. And it's fine, you know.

475
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:11,737
他们有点耽搁了 但是明早会去 所以…
{\fscx73\fscy77}Uh, they're a little delayed, but they'll be there in the morning, so...

476
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:15,032
你送我去汽车旅馆就行 一切安好
{\fscx73\fscy77}Just drop me off at the motel and it's all good.

477
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,912
这哪里是一切安好了？
{\fscx73\fscy77}What exactly is good about that?

478
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:22,498
这…她能搞定
{\fscx73\fscy77}It's, uh-- You know, she has it.

479
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,583

{\fscx73\fscy77}-She said that? -[Scott] Yeah.

480
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,169
把留言给我听听
{\fscx73\fscy77}Let me hear the message.

481
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,590
我删除了
{\fscx73\fscy77}I deleted it.

482
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:36,095
她会去的 她需要那笔钱
{\fscx73\fscy77}She'll be there. I mean, she needs the money.

483
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:40,516
她也会带上他 否则她拿不到他那份 所以…
{\fscx73\fscy77}I mean-- and she's gotta bring him too, or else she won't get his share, so...

484
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:41,850
一切都会顺利办好
{\fscx73\fscy77}You know, it'll work out.

485
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:45,813
-就跟在卡姆登一样吗？ -那都是三年前的事了 吉米
{\fscx73\fscy77}-Like it worked out in Camden? -That was three years ago, Jimmy.

486
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,231
别提了好吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}Come on, man. [stammers]

487
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,192
往前看
{\fscx73\fscy77}Move on.

488
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:55,197
对 对你我来说 往前看或许是个好主意
{\fscx73\fscy77}Yeah, maybe for you and me moving on is a good idea.

489
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,617
我不是那个意思
{\fscx73\fscy77}-That-- That's not what I mean.

490
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,245
是达伦
{\fscx73\fscy77}It's Darren.

491
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,413
达伦 你在哪里？
{\fscx73\fscy77}Darren, where are you, man?

492
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:06,417
伙计 我迟了点 现在在我妈妈家
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>Hey, man, I'm-- I'm running a little late. I'm at my mom's house.</i>

493
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,627
在你妈妈家是什么意思？
{\fscx73\fscy77}What do you mean you're at your mom's house?

494
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:13,007
我有事耽搁了 我马上去汽车旅馆
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>I, uh, got a little delayed. I'll be at-- I'll be at the motel soon.</i>

495
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,302
那跟艾莉在一起的是谁？
{\fscx73\fscy77}Well, then, who the fuck is with Ellie?

496
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,555
他们出来了
{\fscx73\fscy77}[Ellie] All right, here they come.

497
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:07,519
显然她在家里地位最高
{\fscx73\fscy77}Whoa. She's clearly running the family.

498
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:10,397
对 他好像没了她就会迷路
{\fscx73\fscy77}Yeah, he looks like he'd be lost without her.

499
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,317
你知道他迷路时会怎么做
{\fscx73\fscy77}And you know what he does when he's lost.

500
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,319
报警…
{\fscx73\fscy77}Calls the police.

501
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,531
好了 希望她把箱子留在里面了
{\fscx73\fscy77}All right, hopefully she left the briefcase inside.

502
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,451
不…拿绿包的人不是她
{\fscx73\fscy77}Oh, no, no, no, no. That's not the woman with the green bag.

503
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:23,577
什么意思？
{\fscx73\fscy77}What do you mean?

504
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,413
那个人大概年轻30岁
{\fscx73\fscy77}She was like, I don't know, 30 years younger.

505
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,457
-你确定吗？ -确定
{\fscx73\fscy77}-Are you sure? -Yeah.

506

-如果她把门锁了呢？ -你刚才看到她没锁了
{\fscx73\fscy77}-[Danny] What if she locked it? -You just saw her not lock the door.

508
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,885
住在这地方 就是为了
{\fscx73\fscy77}The whole point of living out here

509
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,388
不用担心我们这样的人
{\fscx73\fscy77}is so they don't have to worry about people like us.

{\fscx73\fscy77}-Hey, is this her? -Yeah, that's her.

00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,504
-我猜这是女儿 -但药在她包里
{\fscx73\fscy77}-I guess it's the daughter. -But she had the pills.

514
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,381
不清楚 药肯定是她妈妈的
{\fscx73\fscy77}I don't know, they must be her mom's.

{\fscx73\fscy77}Ms. Wierengo. Hi. Yeah. Um...

{\fscx73\fscy77}I believe you may have a briefcase that belongs to me.

580
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,034
天啊 是的
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>Oh. Oh, my God, yes.</i>

581
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:46,872

582
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:50,792
你的包？是在我这里
{\fscx73\fscy77}Your bag? Yeah, I've got it.

583
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,712

584
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:57,757
手提箱里有重要文件 我马上就需要
{\fscx73\fscy77}and there are some essential documents in it that I need right now.

585
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,885
我…
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>Oh, well, I...</i>

586
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:07,350
今天天气这么好 出办公室走走如何？
{\fscx73\fscy77}Look, it's a beautiful day outside. Why not get out of the office, right?

587
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,737
不行 达伦
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>No fucking way, Darren.</i>

588
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:22,365
我不管多久 你不能出去干活
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>I don't care how long it takes, you're not running any errands.</i>

589
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:28,914
喂？
{\fscx73\fscy77}Hello?

590
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:32,208
先生 我们看到箱子了
{\fscx73\fscy77}Sir, uh, we got the briefcase.

591
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:33,668
-真的吗？ -是的…
{\fscx73\fscy77}-<i>Really?</i> -Yeah, yeah.

592
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:35,921
-怎么看到的？ -我不知道
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>-How?</i> -I-- I don't know.

593
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:38,965
她出大楼了 手里拿着那个手提箱
{\fscx73\fscy77}She walked out of her building and she had the briefcase with her.

594
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,760
所以我们决定跟着她
{\fscx73\fscy77}So we decided to follow her, right?

595
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:44,137
好 但我只让你们盯着她
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>All right, but I told you to just stay on her.</i>

596
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,390
是…
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>Uh, yeah, yeah.</i>

597
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:48,808
但我们觉得…
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>But then we started thinking like...</i>

598
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,518
你觉得她要去哪里？
{\fscx73\fscy77}Where do you think she's going with it?

599
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:53,730
不知道 你觉得她会去找警察吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}I don't know. Do you think she's gonna go to the cops?

600
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:55,607
我不知道
{\fscx73\fscy77}I don't know.

601
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:58,401
-这样有道理 -对吧？
{\fscx73\fscy77}-<i>Yeah, that makes sense, I guess.</i> -Right?

602
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:02,489
所以我们决定紧紧盯着她
{\fscx73\fscy77}So we decided to keep, uh, real close and-- and-- and watch her,

603
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,158
我们一刻也没让她离开过视线
{\fscx73\fscy77}and we didn't take our eyes off her one bit.

604
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:25,428
她起来了
{\fscx73\fscy77}[Ellie] She's getting up.

605
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:27,722
我们得拿到那个手提箱
{\fscx73\fscy77}We gotta get that briefcase.

606
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,683
我穿着她妈妈的裙子
{\fscx73\fscy77}I'm wearing her mom's dress.

607
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:35,897
好吧 我去拿
{\fscx73\fscy77}All right. Let me deal with it, all right?

608
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,417
-等一下 你好 -你好
{\fscx73\fscy77}-Hey. Hey! Hi. -Oh, hey.

00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,340

{\fscx73\fscy77}No, no, I know. Don't worry. I got it. Here.

613
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,932
好…

614

-谢谢 -谢谢 太谢谢你了
{\fscx73\fscy77}-Thanks. -Thank you! Thank you so much.

615
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:18,064
那我先走了 但是谢谢你
{\fscx73\fscy77}I guess I'm gonna head back down here, but thank you.

616
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,400
-祝你会议顺利 -谢谢
{\fscx73\fscy77}-Good luck with your meeting. -Thank you.

617

-她就那么…给我了 -我们走
{\fscx73\fscy77}She just gave-- She just gave it-- -Let's go!

618
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,079
我什么都没跟她说
{\fscx73\fscy77}I didn't even say anything to her.

619
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:37,292
我们做得特别聪明 她一点都没起疑
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>We were real smart about it, too, like she didn't suspect a thing at all.</i>

620
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:47,427
好 我不需要听全部细节
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>All right. I don't need to hear the whole story.</i>

621
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,012
到汽车旅馆外跟我见面
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>Just meet outside the motel.</i>

622
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:51,723
好的 先生 我能跟我哥哥说话吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}Okay. Um, sir, can I talk to my brother, please?

623
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:53,433
他们想在汽车旅馆外跟我们见面
{\fscx73\fscy77}They want us to meet at the motel.

624
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:57,020
-他们拿到手提箱了 -什么？
{\fscx73\fscy77}-They got the briefcase. -What?

625
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,938
看来你小子走运
{\fscx73\fscy77}Looks like you're a lucky son of a bitch.

626
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,198
-达伦？ -是我
{\fscx73\fscy77}-<i>Darren?</i> -Yeah.

627
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:10,366
我们拿到手提箱了 我们成功了
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>We got the briefcase, man. We came through.</i>

628
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,452
你还跟那个女孩在一起吗？说波兰语
{\fscx73\fscy77}Are you there with the girl? Talk in Polish.

629
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:14,537
是的
{\fscx73\fscy77} <i>Yeah.</i>

630
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:17,957
谢天谢地
{\fscx73\fscy77}Thank fucking God.

631
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:21,753
听着 她在耍我们
{\fscx73\fscy77}Listen, she's screwing us over.

632
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,005
什么？不 她没有
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>What? No, she's not.</i>

633
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:27,092
她跟他们谈好了 她会拿到我那份
{\fscx73\fscy77}She cut a deal with them. She gets my share...

634
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:30,762
只要她看着你把事情办好
{\fscx73\fscy77}if she babysits you until it's done.

635
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:33,973
不…她其实挺好的
{\fscx73\fscy77}No, no. She's really cool.

636
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:40,271
听着 丹尼 我知道你可能喜欢她
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>Listen, Danny, I know you probably like her and all,</i>

637
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:41,397
但你想想
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>but think about it.</i>

638
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:45,693
她肯定一直紧紧跟着你 对吧？
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>I bet she was real insistent on you sticking around the whole time, right?</i>

639
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:49,489
你觉得她为什么那样？
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>Why do you think she would do that?</i>

640
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:56,830
你还在听吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>You there, kid?</i>

641
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,082
在
{\fscx73\fscy77}Yeah.

642
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,459
听我说 我很抱歉 丹尼
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>Look, I'm sorry, Danny.</i>

643
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:05,171
她是个大骗子 脱衣舞女
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>She's a con artist. Stripper.</i>

644
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:08,466
是服务员
{\fscx73\fscy77}Waitress.

645
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:11,010
随便
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>Yeah, whatever, man.</i>

646
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,972
重点是你就是她的支票
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>Point is, you're a fucking paycheck to her.</i>

647
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:15,765
但如果你把手提箱带回来
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>But if you bring the briefcase back,</i>

648
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,518
那我就能拿到全部酬劳 让她白忙活了
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>then I can get the whole share and cut her out of it.</i>

649
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:24,524
丹尼？
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>Danny?</i>

650
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:29,654
你把手提箱带回家
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>Just get the briefcase and come home.</i>

651
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:31,531
好吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}<i>All right?</i>

652
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:37,662
好
{\fscx73\fscy77}Yeah.

653
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,582
你会说俄语？
{\fscx73\fscy77}You speak Russian?

654
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:42,750
波兰语
{\fscx73\fscy77}Polish.

655
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:46,171
然后我想到我们中场休息时溜进去
{\fscx73\fscy77}Then I figured out we were-- we were sneaking in at intermission.

656
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,716
不过我有点喜欢那样
{\fscx73\fscy77}I don't know, I kind of preferred it that way, though.

657
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,223
怎么了？
{\fscx73\fscy77}What's wrong?

658
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,308
没事
{\fscx73\fscy77}Nothing.

659
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:01,060
怎么了？
{\fscx73\fscy77}What?

660
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,688
-快告诉我怎么了 -我被炒了 好吗？
{\fscx73\fscy77}-Come on, tell me what's up. -I got fired, all right?

661
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,733
他们给我妈妈打了电话
{\fscx73\fscy77}They called my mom.

662
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,485
达伦刚告诉我 没事的
{\fscx73\fscy77}Darren just told me. It doesn't matter.

663
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,236
很遗憾
{\fscx73\fscy77}I'm sorry.

664
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,447
我没去上班 这样正常
{\fscx73\fscy77}I missed my shift, it happens.

665
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,781
无所谓
{\fscx73\fscy77}It doesn't matter.

666
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,371
等等…听我说
{\fscx73\fscy77}Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Listen.

667
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:24,167
我在想 等我们去汽车旅馆
{\fscx73\fscy77}I was thinking that when we get to the motel...

668
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,045
你应该在附近等着
