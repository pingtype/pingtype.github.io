1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
中字翻译：求人不如求己

2
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,567
Troy, 你别再说谎了
Troy, you ought to stop that lying.

3
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,269
我没有说谎
I ain't lying.

4
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:12,137
那个黑人藏着个这么大的西瓜
Nigger had a watermelon this big,

5
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:14,073
还说: 什么西瓜, Mr. Rand?
talking about, "what watermelon, Mr. Rand?"

6
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:16,809
我真想上前跟他对质, 还"什么西瓜, Mr. Rand?"
I'd like to fell out. "What watermelon, Mr. Rand?"

7
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:18,510
那个西瓜就大大的放在那
And it sitting there, big as life.

8
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,612
- 那Mr. Rand说了什么?   - 他没说什么
- What Mr. Rand say?   - He ain't said nothing.

9
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,281
他知道, 如果这个黑人那么愚蠢
He figure, if the nigger was too dumb

10
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:23,449
不知道自己在藏着一个西瓜
to know he's carrying a watermelon,

11
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:25,384
他也不能跟他说道理
he wasn't going to get much sense out of him.

12
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:28,287
他把那大西瓜藏在他的外衣下
Trying to hide that great, big, old watermelon under his coat.

13
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:31,090
害怕让那些白人看到他偷回家
Afraid to let the white man see him carry it home.

14
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:33,425
我像你一样, 我没有时间跟这种蠢人相处
I'm like you. I ain't got no time for them kinda people.

15
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,160
告诉我, 为何那个人看起来那么生气
Now, what he look like getting mad

16
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:37,196
在他看到从工会来的人跟Mr. Rand说话之后?
'cause he seen the man from the union talking to Mr. Rand?

17
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:38,597
他上前跟我说
He come up to me, talking about

18
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,432
Troy Maxson早晚会让我们失去工作的
"Troy Maxson gonna get us fired."

19
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,601
我跟他说:别跟我说这个
I told him, "get away from me with that."

20
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,337
他一边走一边说你是专门制造麻烦的人
He walked away from me calling you a troublemaker.

21
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,339
Mr. Rand怎样说?
What Mr. Rand say?

22
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:49,174
他没说什么, 只叫我
He ain't said nothing. Told me to go down

23
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:51,110
下星期五到理事长的办公室, 停下!
to the commissioner's office next Friday. Whoa!

24
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,578
他们叫我去那里会面
They called me down there to see them.

25
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,147
你一天还在投诉当中
Well, as long as you got your complaint filed,

26
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:56,119
他们就不能辞退你
they can't fire you.

27
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,516
那是一个白人跟我说的
That's what one of them white fellas tell me.

28
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:58,851
我才不担心他们会辞退我
I ain't worried about them firing me.

29
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:01,320
就因为我问了个问题, 他们就要辞退我?
What, they gonna fire me 'cause I asked a question?

30
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:02,421
我只问了个问题
That's all I did.

31
00:02:02,423 --> 00:02:04,490
我问Mr. Rand
I went to Mr. Rand and I asked him.

32
00:02:04,562 --> 00:02:05,762
我问他: 为何?
I asked him, "why?

33
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,893
为何你让所有白人负责驾驶, 而有色人种就去搬运?
Why you got all the white mens driving, and the colored lifting?"

34
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:09,895
跟他说:什么事了? 我不重要吗?
Told him, "what's the matter? Don't I count?

35
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:12,164
你以为只有白人才够聪明去驾驶吗?
Think only white fellows got sense enough to drive a truck?"

36
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,366
该死的, 那又不是写文件, 任何人都懂驾驶
"Hell, that ain't no paper job. Anybody can drive a truck.

37
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:16,635
你为何让所有白人驾驶, 而有色人种去搬运?
"How come you got all the whites driving and the colored lifting?"

38
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,606
他回答我: 去跟工会说吧
He told me, "take it to the union."

39
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:22,174
该死的, 我就去投诉
Well, hell, that's what I done.

40
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:24,343
而现在他们就想说一堆谎话隐瞒过去
Now they want to come up with this pack of lies.

41
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:26,678
我跟Brownie说了, 如果那些人向他查询
I told Brownie if the man come and ask him any questions,

42
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,280
就即管告诉事实
just tell the truth.

43
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:30,182
这只不过是因为你投诉了
Ain't nothing but somebody trumped it up on you

44
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:31,316
所以有人要诬蔑你
'cause you filed a complaint on.

45
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,551
Brownie没那么聪明
Brownie ain't got that much sense.

46
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:33,886
他什么事也不去想
Man wasn't thinking about nothing.

47
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:35,654
我只想他们改正职位描述
All I want them to do is change the job description,

48
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,223
给所有人一个机会去驾驶, 开车
give everybody a chance to drive the truck. Oi!

49
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:42,294
Brownie没想过这, 他不是很聪明
Brownie can't see that. He ain't got that much sense.

50
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,616
你怎么知道他一直在跟
How you figure he be making out

51
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:07,286
Taylor的酒吧里那个女子调情?
with that gal, be up in Taylors' all the time?

52
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:08,954
- 那个叫Alberta的女子   - 谁?
- That Alberta gal?   - Who?

53
00:03:09,026 --> 00:03:09,926
Brownie.
Brownie.

54
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,724
我跟他经常在一起, 就像我们一样,
Same as you and me, getting about as much as we is.

55
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:15,460
- 心照不宣吧   - 是吗?
- Which is to say nothing.   - It is, huh?

56
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:18,197
我想你比我更猜得透他吧
Well, I figure you doing a little better than me.

57
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,598
我不会跟你说我在猜什么
And I ain't saying what I'm doing!

58
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,567
朋友, 听着, 我太了解你
Nigger, look here. I know you.

59
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,602
难怕你只接近了她一点
If you had gotten anywhere near that gal,

60
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:25,971
二十分钟后你就想跟谁说了
20 minutes later, you'd be looking to tell somebody.

61
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:27,472
而你第一个想要分享的对象
And the first one you gonna want to tell,

62
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,508
想要吹嘘的对象就是我
that you gonna want to brag to is going to be me.

63
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,977
我不会这样做
Oh, I ain't saying that.

64
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:34,279
我看到你在偷看她
I see where you be eyeing her.

65
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,548
我所有女人都看, 我不会错过任何女人
I eye all the women. I don't miss nothing.

66
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,854
别听别人说...
Don't never let nobody tell you

67
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:38,888
Troy Maxson不看女人
Troy Maxson don't eye the women.

68
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,352
你顗觎她呢
Hey, you been doing more than eyeing her.

69
00:03:40,424 --> 00:03:41,624
你请她喝酒了
You done bought her a drink or two.

70
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:42,955
天啊, 我是请过她, 那又如何?
Hell, yeah, I bought her a drink. What that mean?

71
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:44,323
我也请过你喝酒
I bought you one, too.

72
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:45,958
那算什么, 就因为我请她喝了一杯?
What that mean, 'cause I buy her a drink?

73
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,259
我只是出于礼貌
I'm just being polite.

74
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:48,460
你请她喝一杯完全可以
It's all right to buy her one drink.

75
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,329
那就是出于礼貌
That's what you call being polite.

76
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:51,997
但当你继续请她喝酒
But when you want to be buying two or three,

77
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,532
那就是顗觎
that's what you call eyeing her.

78
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:55,367
听着, 你认识我这样久了
Look here. As long as you've known me,

79
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,336
你有听过我去追求女人吗?
you ever known me to chase after women?

80
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:59,571
当然有, 一直认识你以来你都有
Hell, yeah! Long as I've known you.

81
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,006
你忘了我认识你多久了
You're forgetting, I knew you when.

82
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:03,275
我在说在我跟Rose结婚后
I'm talking about since I been married to Rose.

83
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,444
噢...那倒没有
Oh... not since you been married to Rose.

84
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:06,979
我可以说, 那倒是真的
That's the truth, though. I can say that.

85
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:08,614
明白了吧, 没什么可说
All right then. Case closed.

86
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,984
我在Alberta的房子外看见过你
I see you be walking up around Alberta's house.

87
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:13,452
那种时候你应该在Taylor的酒吧才对
You supposed to be at Taylors',

88
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:14,753
而你却在那里出现了
and you be walking up around there.

89
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,021
你为何在意我去哪?
What you watching where I'm walking for?

90
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:17,193
我也没在意你去哪
I don't be watching after you.

91
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,358
不, 我看见你在那里不只一次
No, I seen you walking around there more than once.

92
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,830
当然, 我们经常在一起
Hell, you liable to see me walking anywhere.

93
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,694
你看到我在那里不代表什么
That don't mean nothing 'cause you seen me walking around there.

94
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,029
她从哪来的?
Where'd she come from, anyway?

95
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,464
她就好像突然出现一样
She just kinda showed up one day.

96
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:26,765
塔拉哈西, 你看到她
Tallahassee. You can look at that

97
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,734
就知道她是来自佛罗里达州 [塔拉哈西是其首都]
and tell she one of them Florida gals.

98
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:31,270
那里的女人都亭亭玉立
They got some big, healthy women down there.

99
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:33,005
就像树一样高大
Grow them right up out of the ground.

100
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:34,640
她有印度人的血统
She got a little bit of Indian in her.

101
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:36,608
很多在佛罗里达州的黑人都有印度人血统
Most of them niggers in Florida got some Indian in them.

102
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,677
我不知道她是不是混血儿
Yeah, I don't know about that Indian part,

103
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:41,713
但她真的很高大
but she damn sure big and healthy.

104
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,782
要是让她穿上长袜
Woman wears some big stockings.

105
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:48,320
再张开她那双诱人的腿, 真棒
Got them crazy big legs, and hips wide as the Mississippi river.

106
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:49,655
双腿并不重要
Legs don't mean nothing.

107
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:51,490
它们只会在做爱时阻碍你
You don't do nothing but push 'em out of the way.

108
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:53,058
但是臀部可重要了
But them hips,

109
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,493
它们坐在你上面时软呼呼的
they cushion the ride.

110
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:56,295
Troy, 不能这样算
Troy, you ain't got no sense!

111
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:59,364
那是真的, 像你年轻做爱时一样
It's the truth. Like you riding on goodyears!

112
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,403
你们在这里都在聊什么了?
What you all out here getting into?

113
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:06,638
女人, 你为何在意我们在聊什么?
What you worried about what we getting into for, woman?

114
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,710
这是男人之间的讨论
This is men talk.

115
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,341
我又怎么会在意呢?
What I care what you all are talking about?

116
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:10,642
Bono, 你要留下来吃晚餐吗?
Bono, you gonna stay for supper?

117
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,044
不了, 谢谢, Rose
No, thank you, Rose,

118
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:14,479
Lucille说她今晚要煮猪脚
but Lucille say she cooking up a pot of pigfeet.

119
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,548
猪脚? 那我也跟你回去了
Pigfeet? Hell, I'm going home with you.

120
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,817
要是你家煮猪脚, 我甚至会在你那睡一晚
I might even stay the night, you got some pigfeet.

121
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,752
Rose, 你里面有煮什么比猪脚还棒的吗?
You got something in there to top them pigfeet, Rose?

122
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,322
我在煮鸡肉, 今晚吃鸡肉和羽衣甘蓝叶
I'm cooking up some chicken. I got some chicken and collard greens.

123
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:24,523
那你先进去继续烹调
Well, you go on back in the house.

124
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:25,757
让Bono和我继续刚才的话题
Let me and Bono finish what we talking about.

125
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,627
这是男人之间的讨论, 我待会也有些事要跟你讨论
This is men talk. I got some talk for you later.

126
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,662
你也知道我要说什么的
And you know what kind of talk I mean, too.

127
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,397
你先进去准备下 [指做爱]
You go on in there and powder it up.

128
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,699
Troy, 够了!
Troy, stop it!

129
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:36,735
噢, 来吧, 女人
Oh, woman, come here.

130
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:40,105
Bono, 听着
Oh! Look here, Bono.

131
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:42,641
我第一次看到这女人时
When I first met this woman,

132
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,543
我就行动了
I got out that place there.

133
00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:47,543
我准备好我的马匹
Hitch up my pony, saddle up my mare

134
00:05:47,643 --> 00:05:50,343
因为那里有个女人在等着我
there's a woman out there for me somewhere

135
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,084
我到处找寻她的踪影
I looked at here, looked at there,

136
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:54,419
然后看到Rose时我就彻底被她迷住了
saw Rose, and I latched on to her.

137
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,388
我想也没想就上前跟她说...
I latched on to her and I told her...

138
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,756
我来告诉你当时到底发生了什么事
Now, I'm gonna tell you the truth.

139
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:02,427
我跟她说: 宝贝, 我不想要结婚
I latched on to her and told her, "baby, I don't want to marry.

140
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:03,895
我只想成为你的男人
"I just want to be your man."

141
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:06,598
Rose回答我... 你来告诉他, Ro
Rose told me... Tell him what you told me, Ro.

142
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,567
我跟他说如果他不打算长相厮守
I told him if he wasn't the marrying kind,

143
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,736
那就滚开, 别挡着那些想的人前来
then move out of the way, so the marrying kind could find me.

144
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:13,438
她真这么说了: 朋友, 你在挡着我
That's what she told me, "nigger, you in my way.

145
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,706
你在阻挡我的视线
"You blocking the view.

146
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,708
滚开, 让我找我的爱人
"Move out the way, so I can find me a husband."

147
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,444
- 我想了几天    - 你才没有
- I thought it over 2-3 days.   - Two-three days, nothing.

148
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:20,779
你那晚就回来了
You was back the same night.

149
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:23,115
我回来并跟她说: 好吧, 宝贝
I come back, told her, "okay, baby,

150
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:24,850
但我要买一只矮脚公鸡 [比正常公鸡小, 但好斗]
"but I'm gonna buy me a banty rooster

151
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:26,685
把它放在后院里
"and put him out there in the backyard.

152
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,391
当它看到陌生人
"And when he see a stranger come,

153
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,125
它就会到处跑跟大声啼叫
"he gonna flap his wings and crow."

154
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:31,990
Bono, 看这里, 我看着前门就够烦了
Look here, Bono. I done watched that front door by myself.

155
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,693
我担心的是[她的]后庭
It was that back door I was worried about.

156
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:37,529
Troy, 别说了, 你在撒谎
Don't talk like that! Troy, you're not but telling a lie.

157
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:38,897
但是我们结婚后才发现
Only thing was, we first got married,

158
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,633
忘了那公鸡吧, 因为我们根本负担不起后院
forget the rooster. We ain't had no yard.

159
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:42,705
我也明白
I hear you tell it.

160
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,470
Lucille和我以前住在Logan街 [美国, 丹佛]
Me and Lucille was staying down there on Logan street.

161
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,806
我们有两间房子, 还有个厕所在后院里
Had two rooms with the outhouse in the back.

162
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:49,608
我平常都不介意的
I ain't mind the outhouse none.

163
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,144
但当冬天时有阵该死的冷锋吹过
But when that goddamn wind blew through there in the winter,

164
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:53,879
我就恨死它了! [以前家里没有水管]
that's what I'm talking about!

165
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,647
直至今天, 我还在想
To this day, I wonder why the hell

166
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,150
为何我会住在那里六年之久
I ever stayed down there for six long years.

167
00:06:58,152 --> 00:07:00,719
我当时也不知道可以怎办
But, see, I didn't know I could do no better.

168
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:03,588
我以为只有白人才配有室内厕所什么的
I thought only white folks had inside toilets and things.

169
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,760
很多人也像这样
A lot of folks don't think

170
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,525
安于现状
they can do no better than they're doing now.

171
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:07,726
那是些要改变的想法
Just something you gotta learn.

172
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,661
就像很多人还去Bella的店买东西
A lot of folks still shop at Bella's.

173
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,463
Bella卖的东西没问题啊, 她卖的食物也很新鲜
Ain't nothing wrong with Bella's. She got fresh food.

174
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:13,198
我不是在说她卖的食物有没有问题
I ain't said nothing about if she got fresh food.

175
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,666
我在说她卖的价钱
I'm talking about what she charge.

176
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,635
同样的货品她比A&P卖贵十美分
She charges 10 cents more than the A&P.

177
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,203
A&P没为我做过什么
A&P ain't never done nothing for me.

178
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,172
我会选择消费在我认为对的地方
I spend my money where I'm treated right.

179
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:21,444
我到Bella的店里说
I go down to Bella, say,

180
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,942
我要买一条面包, 星期五付钱, 她就给我了
"i need a loaf of bread, I'll pay you Friday," she gives it to me.

181
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,911
如果我还在
What sense that make when I got money

182
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:27,512
其他地方消费
to spend it somewhere else

183
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:28,947
把这个卖人情给我的人忘掉, 我还算什么?
and ignore the person who done right by me?

184
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,152
圣经里没教人忘恩负义
That ain't in the Bible.

185
00:07:30,154 --> 00:07:31,882
我们不是在谈论圣经
We ain't talking about what's in the Bible.

186
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,785
明知道她卖贵了, 还在那买东西, 这样理智吗?
What sense it make to shop there when she overcharges?

187
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,624
那你去你想去的地方买
Well, you do your shopping where you want to,

188
00:07:35,654 --> 00:07:37,492
我去卖过人情给我的地方买
I do my shopping where people been good to me.

189
00:07:37,522 --> 00:07:38,957
噢, 我只是不认同她卖贵了而已
Oh, I don't think it's right for her to overcharge, that's all.

190
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,492
听着, 我该走了
Look here, I got to be getting on.

191
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:41,827
Lucille都要发怒了
Lucille gonna be raising all kind of hell.

192
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,595
朋友, 你要去哪, 我们还没喝完这瓶呢
Where you going, nigger? We ain't finished this pint.

193
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:44,867
先喝完吧
Come here finish this pint.

194
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:48,767
我会留下啊, 如果你请我喝的话
Well, hell, I am, if you ever turn the bottle loose.

195
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,735
我唯一要感谢A&P的地方
Only thing I'll say about the A&P is,

196
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:53,038
就是他们让Cory在那工作
I'm glad Cory got that job down there.

197
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:55,539
帮补一下他的开支
Help him with his school clothes and things.

198
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,576
Gabe搬走了, 我们有点捉襟见肘
Gabe done moved out, things getting tight around here.

199
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:58,810
他有份工作
He got that job,

200
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,545
至少可以照顾下自己
he can start to look out for himself.

201
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:03,782
Cory被一间大学的美式足球队录取了
Cory done got recruited by a college football team.

202
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:06,918
我跟他说过大学的美式足球队到底是怎么一回事
I told that boy about that college football stuff.

203
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,821
那些白人不会让他碰美式足球的
The white man ain't gonna let him get nowhere with that football.

204
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,890
他第一次来我就跟他解释过了
I told him when he first come to me with it.

205
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:14,693
现在你告诉我他更着迷了
Now, you come telling me he done got more tied up in it.

206
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:16,795
他该去车行工作
He ought to get recruited in how to fix cars,

207
00:08:16,867 --> 00:08:18,467
还是做点能令他过活的事
or some way he can make a living.

208
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:20,665
他不是想成为职业美式足球员
He ain't talking about making no living playing football.

209
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,701
那只是他的兴趣而已
It's just something the boys in school do.

210
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:24,223
他们会派负责人员来
They're gonna send a recruiter by

211
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,774
跟你商讨, 他会跟你说
to talk to you. He'll tell you.

212
00:08:25,804 --> 00:08:26,905
他不是想成为职业美式足球员
He ain't talking about making no living playing football.

213
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,640
被录取是个荣誉
It's an honor to be recruited.

214
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:31,009
他不会走得远的, Bono就懂
It ain't gonna get him nowhere, Bono'll tell you that.

215
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,579
如果他跟你一样那么有运动细胞, 他会成为伟大的球员
If he be like you in sports, he gonna be all right.

216
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,948
这么久以来只有两个人打棒球比你好
Ain't but two men ever played baseball good as you.

217
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,017
就是Babe Ruth和Josh Gibson [皆为著名棒球员]
That's Babe Ruth and Josh Gibson.

218
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,553
他们就是唯一比你有更多全垒打的人
Them the only two men ever hit more home runs than you.

219
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:43,788
打棒球给了我什么? 我没有地方上厕所
And what it ever get me? I ain't got a pot to piss in,

220
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,060
又或者靠此买过一间房子
or a window to throw it out of.

221
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,925
时代不同了, Troy
Times have changed since you were playing baseball, Troy.

222
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:48,994
你打棒球都是战争之前了, 很多事情都改变了
That was before the war. Times have changed a lot since then.

223
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:50,262
有什么改变了?
How the hell they done changed?

224
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:51,863
现在很多有色人种都在球队里
They got a lot of colored boys playing ball now.

225
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,298
棒球也好, 美式足球也好
Baseball and football.

226
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,601
Ro, 你说对了, 时代不同了, Troy
You right about that, Ro. Times have changed, Troy.

227
00:08:56,673 --> 00:08:57,973
你只是生不逢时而已
You just come along too early.

228
00:08:58,003 --> 00:09:01,706
世上没有所谓"生不逢时"
There ought not never have been no time called "too early."

229
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,544
以他为例...
Now you take that fellow...

230
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,078
那个以前在洋基队
What's that fellow they had playing

231
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,346
当右外野手的叫什么?
right field back then for the Yankees?

232
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:09,281
Bono, 你该记得的
You remember who I'm talking about, Bono,

233
00:09:09,311 --> 00:09:10,634
在洋基队当右外野手的那个
played right field for the Yankees.

234
00:09:10,664 --> 00:09:12,017
- Selkirk?    对, 就是他 [George Selkirk]
- Selkirk?   - Yeah, Selkirk, that's it!

235
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:15,620
他的职业生涯打击率是.269, 你看得出了吗?
Man's batting 269, you understand? 269!

236
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:19,291
那合理吗? 我的打击率是.432, 有37个是全垒打
What sense that make? I'm batting 432 with 37 home runs!

237
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:22,561
他的打击率才.269, 却在洋基队里当右外野手!
He's batting 269, playing right field for the Yankees!

238
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,696
我昨天看到Josh Gibson的女儿
I saw Josh Gibson's daughter yesterday.

239
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:27,332
她穿着破烂的鞋到处跑
She's running around with raggedy shoes on her feet.

240
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,934
我敢打赌Selkirk的女儿
I bet you Selkirk's daughter ain't running around

241
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:30,869
可不是穿着什么破烂的到处走
with no raggedy shoes on her feet. I bet you that.

242
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,804
现在很多职业棒球员都是有色人种了
They got a lot of colored baseball players now.

243
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:33,942
Jackie Robinson是第一个
Jackie Robinson was the first.

244
00:09:33,944 --> 00:09:35,972
Jackie Robinson都是名星了
Folks had to wait for Jackie Robinson.

245
00:09:35,974 --> 00:09:38,877
我看过无数比Jackie Robinson还会打棒球的黑人
I done seen 100 niggers play baseball better than Jackie Robinson.

246
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,880
我甚至看过Jackie Robinson都进不了的球队
Hell, I seen some teams Jackie Robinson couldn't even make!

247
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,114
还说什么Jackie Robinson?
What you talking about, Jackie Robinson?

248
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,950
Jackie Robinson只是个无名小卒而已!
Jackie Robinson wasn't nobody!

249
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,618
我要说的是如果你会打球
I'm talking about if you could play ball,

250
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,886
他们就该给你机会
then they ought to let you play.

251
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:49,054
而不是在意你的肤色人种
Don't matter what color you are.

252
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:50,889
还说我生不逢时
Come telling me I come along too early.

253
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:54,092
如果你会打球, 他们就该给你机会
If you can play, then they ought to let you play.

254
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,727
你再继续这么喝会死的
You gonna drink yourself to death.

255
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,762
不用喝那么多吧
You don't need to be drinking like that.

256
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,999
噢, 死神而已, 我都见过了
Oh! Death ain't nothing. I done seen him,

257
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,034
还跟他搏斗过, 不用你来跟我说
I done wrestled with him. You can't tell me nothing about death.

258
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:06,638
死神不过是个外角的快速球
Death ain't nothing but a fastball on the outside corner,

259
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,607
而你知道我有什么能耐
and you know what I do with that.

260
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,375
Bono, 看这里, 我有在说谎吗?
Look here, Bono, am I lying?

261
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:13,345
你扔个到腰水平高度的快速球
You get one of them fastballs about waist high

262
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:14,946
从外角扔过来
on the outside corner of the plate

263
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,815
那简直易如反掌
where you can get the meat of the bat on it,

264
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:20,051
老天啊, 我会把它打到出场外
and, good god, you could kiss it good-bye.

265
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,120
- 我在吹嘘吗?    - 不, 你在说事实
- Am I lying?   - No, you telling the truth.

266
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:23,292
我亲眼看见过
I seen you do it.

267
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:26,797
如果我在吹牛, 那会是天大的谎话
If I'm lying, that's 450 feet worth of lying.

268
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,960
死神来我来说就是这么回事
That's all death is to me.

269
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,630
一个从外角扔来的快速球
A fastball on the outside corner.

270
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,898
我不知道你为何说起死亡了?
I don't know why you want to get on talking about death?

271
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,133
说说又没有问题
Ain't nothing wrong with talking about death.

272
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,035
那是生命的一部分啊, 每个人都必经
That's a part of life! Everybody gonna die.

273
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:38,637
你会死, 我会死
You gonna die. I'm gonna die.

274
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,372
Bono会死, 天啊, 所有人都会死
Bono gonna die. Hell, we all gonna die.

275
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:41,706
但你也没必要继续说吧
But you ain't got to talk about it.

276
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:42,841
我不喜欢说这种事
I don't like talking about it.

277
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:44,009
那是你提起的
Well, you the one brought it up.

278
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:45,810
Bono和我刚才在说棒球
Me and Bono talking about baseball.

279
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,846
你突然说我会喝死
You come telling me I'm gonna drink myself to death.

280
00:10:47,918 --> 00:10:48,818
不是吗, Bono?
Ain't that right, Bono?

281
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,416
你知道我一周只有一晚去喝酒
Now you know I drink just but one night out the week,

282
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:52,388
那是星期五晚
that's Friday night.

283
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,653
我不会喝多
I drink just enough to where I can handle it.

284
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:55,625
然后我就会离开, 不碰它了
Then I leaves it alone. I cuts it loose.

285
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,123
所以你不必担心我会喝死
So, you ain't got to worry about me drinking myself to death

286
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,891
因为我不害怕死亡
'cause I ain't worrying about death.

287
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:02,727
我见过他, 跟他搏斗过
I done seen him, done wrestled with him.

288
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,899
跟你说, Bono
Look here, Bono.

289
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:07,132
我有天看到死神举军冲向我
I look up one day, and death is marching straight at me,

290
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:09,401
像是阅兵时的士军队一样
like soldiers on parade.

291
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:11,903
当时死神大军在冲向我
The army of death was marching straight at me.

292
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:15,173
当时是1941年7月中
It was the middle of July, 1941.

293
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,742
然而却像冬天一般冷
And it got real cold, just like it be winter.

294
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,177
那时候死神他啊
And it seemed like death, himself,

295
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,413
好像举手碰了我肩膀一下
reached out and touched me on the shoulder.

296
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:24,883
他像我现在碰你一样, 我感受到那寒意
He touched me like I touch you now. I got cold as ice.

297
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:26,084
死神就站在那里, 对我露出不友善的笑容
Death standing there, grinning at me.

298
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:27,952
Troy, 别说了
Troy, why don't you hush that talk.

299
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:31,189
我说: 死神先生, 你想要什么? 要带走我吗?
I said, "what you want, Mr. death? You be wanting me?

300
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,158
你不再派你的小卒来了吗?
"You done sent your army to be getting me?"

301
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,947
我直直的看着他
I looked him dead in the eye.

302
00:11:34,077 --> 00:11:35,164
我什么都不怕
I wasn't fearing nothing.

303
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,163
我准备跟他斗个你死我活, 直至现在我都是!
I was ready to tangle, just like I'm ready to tangle now!

304
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,465
圣经说要经常警惕
Bible says be ever vigilant.

305
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:42,901
所以我不会喝醉, 我还要耳听八方
So, I don't get but so drunk. I got to keep watch.

306
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,703
Troy当时进了慈善医院
Troy was right down there at mercy hospital.

307
00:11:44,775 --> 00:11:45,675
你记得他那次得了肺炎
You remember he had that pneumonia,

308
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,006
还有发烧, 躺在床上还说些有的没的
laying there with a fever, talking plumb out his head.

309
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,240
当时死神站在那盯着我
And death standing there, staring at me,

310
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:50,909
手握着镰刀
carrying that sickle in his hand.

311
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:56,815
终于, 他说: 你想再活多一年吗?
Finally, he say, "you want to be bound over for another year?"

312
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:58,983
他这样说
Just like that. He say,

313
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:02,921
你想再活多一年吗?
"you want to be bound over for another year?"

314
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:06,958
我说: 去你的, 我们现在就说清楚
I said, "bound over, hell! We can settle this right now."

315
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,993
他听了后退后了点
He kinda fell back when I said that.

316
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,462
我即时龙精虎猛
And all the cold went out of me.

317
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:12,797
我伸手抢去他的镰刀
I reached down, I grabbed that sickle.

318
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,265
我用尽力气扔走它
I threw it as far as I could throw it,

319
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,101
然后我们开始埋身肉搏
and me and him commenced to wrestling.

320
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:19,838
我们打了...六...三天三夜
We wrestled for... Carry the six... Three days and three nights!

321
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,107
我不知道从哪儿来的力量
Now, I don't know where I got the strength from,

322
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:23,975
因为他处于优势时
'cause every time he tried to get the best of me,

323
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:26,778
我重新振作
I reached way deep down inside myself,

324
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,113
并又得到对抗他的力量
found the strength to do him one better.

325
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:29,914
Troy每次说起这事
Every time Troy tells that story,

326
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,116
都有不同的版本
he find different ways to tell it,

327
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,817
不同的谎话
different things to make up.

328
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:34,152
我没有胡说, 女人
I ain't making up nothing, woman.

329
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:35,920
我在说实话
I'm telling you the facts of what happened.

330
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,156
我跟死神搏斗了三天三夜
I wrestled with death for three days and three nights,

331
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:40,892
而现在还能站着跟你说话
and I'm standing here to tell you about it.

332
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,029
继续, 在最后
All right. At the end of the third night,

333
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:48,133
我们都脆弱得站不起来了
we done weakened each other to where we can't even hardly move.

334
00:12:48,205 --> 00:12:49,105
死神突然站起来
Death stood up.

335
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,503
他披上那连帽的白色袍子
He threw on that robe, had a white robe with a hood on it.

336
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:54,973
他披上后便去寻找他的镰刀
He throwed on that robe and ent off to look for that sickle.

337
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:58,843
他说: 我会回来的, 像这样
He said, "I'll be back." Just like that. "I'll be back."

338
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,980
我说: 是吗? 那你得好好找我
I said, "yeah? Well, you gonna have to find me!"

339
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,114
我又不是傻子
I wasn't no fool.

340
00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:05,115
我不会自找麻烦的
I wasn't going looking for him.

341
00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:07,552
我知道死亡不是拿来开玩笑的事, 他早晚会找上我
I know death ain't nothing to play
with. And I know he's gonna get me.

342
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:10,855
我知道我早晚要加入他的大军
I know I got to join his army, his camp followers.

343
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:13,858
但我一天还有力气
But as long as I keep up my strength and see him coming,

344
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,127
还能保持警觉
as long as I keep up my vigilance,

345
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,829
他就得打上一场硬仗
he gonna have to fight to get me.

346
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,063
我不会轻易让他带走我
I ain't going easy.

347
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:23,101
那你看, 既然你要保持警觉
Well, look here, since you got to keep up your vigilance,

348
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,103
让我替你拿着那酒瓶
let me have the bottle.

349
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:26,571
该死的, 我不应该告诉你那部分
Hell, I shouldn't have told you that part.

350
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,027
我应该删掉那部分
I should have left out that part.

351
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,911
Troy一直都说这些话
Troy be talking all that stuff.

352
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:31,943
然而有一半时候他根本不知道自己在说什么
Half the time, he don't even know what he be talking about!

353
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,978
- Bono会了解的   - 对, 我很了解你
- Yeah, Bono know me better than that.
- That's right, I know you.

354
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,148
我知道你就像Uncle Remus一样 [说故事的人]
I know you got some Uncle Remus in your blood.

355
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,551
你有的故事比魔鬼拥有的罪人还多
You got more stories than the devil got sinners.

356
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:42,187
天啊, 我也跟他说过话
Oh, hell, I done seen him, too. Done talked to the devil.

357
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,222
没人想知道
Nobody wants to be hearing that stuff!

358
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,026
嗨, 爸
Hey, pop.

359
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,594
你来这里做什么?
What you come "hey, poppin'" me for?

360
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,896
你好吗, Rose?
How you doing, Rose?

361
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:54,265
Bono先生, 你好吗?
Mr. Bono, how you doing?

362
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,134
嗨, Lyons, 你呢?
Hey, Lyons, how you been?

363
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:57,572
他一定过得很好
He must've been doing all right.

364
00:13:57,574 --> 00:13:58,802
他整周都没来找过我
I ain't seen him around here last week.

365
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,605
Troy, 放过你的儿子吧, 他特地来看你
Troy, leave your boy alone. He come by to see you

366
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,173
而你却又想胡说
and you want to start all that nonsense.

367
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,608
我没有说Lyons什么, 来喝口
I ain't bothering Lyons. Here, get you a drink.

368
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,580
我们知道原因
Me and him got an understanding.

369
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,313
我知道他为何来, 而他也知道
I know why he come by to see me, and he know I know.

370
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:10,281
爸, 别这样说, 我只是来见你一下
Come on, pop. I just stopped by to say hi,

371
00:14:10,353 --> 00:14:11,253
看看你过得怎样了
see how you was doing.

372
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,618
- 但你昨天没来啊   - Lyons, 你留下来吃晚饭吗?
- You ain't stopped by yesterday.
- You staying for supper, Lyons?

373
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,590
我在煮鸡肉
I got some chicken cooking in the oven.

374
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,921
不了, Rose, 谢谢, 我刚巧经过这里而已
No, Rose, thanks. I just was in the neighborhood

375
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:18,256
想着进来看你们一下
and thought I'd stop by for a minute.

376
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:19,924
得了吧, 你刚巧经过这
Yeah, you was in the neighborhood all right.

377
00:14:19,996 --> 00:14:20,896
老兄, 你还真会说话
Nigger, you telling the truth there.

378
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:23,061
你刚巧经过这因为我今天发薪
You was in the neighborhood 'cause it's my payday.

379
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,363
既然你提到了, 给我$10
Well, hell, since you mentioned it, let me have $10.

380
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:29,200
该死的, 我宁愿下地狱
I'll be damned. I'll die and go to hell

381
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,936
和魔鬼玩牌也不会给你
and play Blackjack with the devil before I give you $10.

382
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:34,906
我想知道你看见过的魔鬼
That's what I want to know about, that devil you done seen.

383
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:37,075
爸看见过魔鬼? 真会吹牛
Pop done seen the devil? You too much, pop.

384
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:39,244
- 对, 我见过   - 他才没有
- Yeah, I done seen him. - He ain't seen no devil.

385
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:41,379
我跟他说过那男人不是魔鬼
I told him that man ain't had nothing to do with the devil.

386
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,648
他把任何他不明白的事, 都称呼为魔鬼
Anything he can't understand, he want to call it the devil.

387
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:47,051
看这, Bono, 我去Hertzberger的店买些家具
Look here, Bono. I go by Hertzberger's to get some furniture.

388
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,954
收音机说三房寓所只售$298
You got three rooms for $298. That what it say on the radio.

389
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:53,224
三房寓所只售$298, 他还为此创作了首歌
"Three rooms, $298." He made up a little song about it.

390
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,294
我去到那, 他说我不能贷款
I get down there, man tell me I can't get no credit.

391
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:58,663
我每天都工作, 还不能贷款
I'm working every day, can't get no credit.

392
00:14:58,735 --> 00:14:59,635
那怎办?
What to do?

393
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,666
我只有些破烂的家具
I got an empty house with some raggedy furniture.

394
00:15:01,738 --> 00:15:02,638
Cory没有床
Cory ain't got no bed.

395
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,103
他在地上铺点破布就睡了
He's sleeping on a pile of rags on the floor.

396
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:07,205
每天都工作, 却不能贷款
Working every day, can't get no credit.

397
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:08,673
我回来后, Rose也看到的
I come back here, Rose'll tell you,

398
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,475
我非常愤怒, 想着有什么能做
madder than hell, trying to figure out what to do.

399
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:11,976
有人来敲门
Come a knock on the door.

400
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:14,245
我才住在这里三天, 有谁知道我在这?
I ain't been living but three days, who know I'm here?

401
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,381
我去应门, 原来是魔鬼
I open the door. Devil standing there.

402
00:15:16,453 --> 00:15:17,353
一个大个子
Bigger than life.

403
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,417
一个白人, 穿着得体
White fella, got on good clothes and everything.

404
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,952
手里拿着块剪贴板
Standing there with a clipboard in his hand.

405
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:21,941
我还没说什么
Now, I ain't got to say nothing.

406
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:24,158
他就说了:
First words come out of his mouth,

407
00:15:24,188 --> 00:15:26,457
我知道你需要点家具而你不能贷款
I understand you need some furniture and can't get no credit.

408
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:30,194
我都要晕倒了, 他说: 我会让你贷款
I liked to fell over.
He said, "I'll give you all the credit you want,

409
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,230
但你需要付利息
"but you gonna have to pay the interest on it."

410
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:33,965
我跟他说要是他给我那间寓所
Now, I told him, he give me them three rooms,

411
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,300
多少都行
he can charge whatever he want.

412
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:37,135
有辆货车第二天来了
Next day, a truck pull up here,

413
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:38,937
两个男人给那三间房间布置了家具
two men unload them three rooms.

414
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:41,139
驾车的那位给了我本书
Man what drove the truck give me a book.

415
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:44,676
跟我说每月初, 寄$10到书上这个地址
Said first of the month, send $10 to the address in the book,

416
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:45,947
那就可以了
everything'll be fine.

417
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:46,977
说如果你没付
Said if you miss a payment,

418
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,148
魔鬼会来找你, 而你需要付上更多
the devil was coming back, and there'll be hell to pay.

419
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,716
那是15年前的事
That was 15 years ago.

420
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:55,320
直至今天, 每月初, 我都寄$10
To this day, first day of every month, I send my $10,

421
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:56,988
非常准时, Rose可以担保
just like clockwork. Rose'll tell you.

422
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,226
Troy在说谎
Troy lying.

423
00:15:58,228 --> 00:15:59,956
我从此没再见过那人
I ain't never seen that man since.

424
00:16:00,058 --> 00:16:01,693
你说如果他不是魔鬼会是谁?
Now, you tell me, who else that gonna be but the devil?

425
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:04,028
而我没有卖掉灵魂什么的
And I ain't sold my soul or nothing like that.

426
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,497
我不会跟坐着货车来的魔鬼交易
No, I wouldn't have, truck with the devil over nothing like that.

427
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:10,301
但我却换来所有家具, 所以我准时寄我的十块
But I got my furniture. And I send my $10, just like clockwork.

428
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,271
你都付多久了?
How long you say you been paying this $10 a month?

429
00:16:13,343 --> 00:16:14,243
15年
15 years.

430
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,207
天啊, 那你不是一早付清了吗?
Hell, ain't you finished paying for it yet?

431
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,209
那人要你付多少?
How much the man done charge you?

432
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:19,744
是啊, 我一早付清了
Oh, hell, I done paid for it.

433
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:21,412
早就付清了
I done paid for it 10 times over.

434
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,014
事实是, 我怕我不继续付要承担后果
Fact is, I'm scared to stop paying.

435
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:25,350
别听Troy说的, 家具是在Glickman先生的店买的
Troy lying. We got that furniture from Mr. Glickman.

436
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,218
他没有每月给谁十块
He ain't paying no $10 a month to nobody.

437
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,454
天啊, 女人, Bono知道我不是傻的
Hell, woman, Bono know I ain't that big a fool.

438
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:31,055
我还想说
I was just getting ready to say,

439
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,223
我知道有个桥下卖便宜的家具
I know where there's a bridge for sale.

440
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:33,195
我告诉你
I'll tell you this.

441
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,226
那人是不是魔鬼不重要
It don't matter to me if it was the devil.

442
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:36,494
他有没有给我贷款也不重要
It don't matter if the devil give credit.

443
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,496
- 总有人要给我吧    - 那很重要
- Somebody got to give it.   - It ought to matter.

444
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,065
你到处说你跟魔鬼交易了
You walking around here saying you gonna make truck with the devil,

445
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,400
你将来得跟上帝解释清楚
god's the one you're gonna have to answer to.

446
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,202
祂会作出审判
He's the one gonna be at the judgment.

447
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,204
听着, 爸, 给我十块
Yeah, well, look here, pop, let me have that $10.

448
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:47,305
我会还你的
I'll give it back to you.

449
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:49,007
Bonnie在医院找到工作了
Bonnie got a job working at the hospital.

450
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:49,979
Bono, 我怎跟你说的?
Bono, what did I tell you?

451
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,743
只有这老兄有事相求时我才会见到他
Only time I see this nigger is when he want something.

452
00:16:51,815 --> 00:16:53,015
只有那种时候
That's the only time I see him.

453
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,480
别说这, 爸, Bono先生不想听这个
Come on, pop, Mr. Bono don't want to hear all that.

454
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:58,082
给我十块, 我说过Bonnie找到工作了吧
Let me have the $10. I told you, Bonnie's working!

455
00:16:58,154 --> 00:16:59,854
她找到工作又如何了?
What that mean to me if Bonnie's working?

456
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:02,453
我不在乎, 要是她在工作, 你就去问她拿十块
I don't care if she working. Go ask her for $10 if she's working.

457
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:05,323
还说她在工作, 那你为何不工作?
Talking about Bonnie working. Why ain't you working?

458
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,558
爸, 你知道我不能找到正当工作
Ah, pop, you know I can't find no decent job.

459
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,028
我去哪找? 你知道我的过去
Where am I gonna get a job at? You know I can't get no job.

460
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,230
我说过, 我认识一些人
I told you, I know some people down there.

461
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:14,198
如果你想, 我可以让你来清理垃圾
I can get you on the rubbish if you want to work.

462
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,101
你上次有事相求时我就跟你说了
I told you that last time you come back here asking for something.

463
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:18,336
不了, 爸, 谢谢, 那不适合我
No, pop, thanks, that ain't for me.

464
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:20,104
我不想替人清理垃圾
I don't want to be carrying nobody's rubbish.

465
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:21,806
我不想做这些千篇一律的工作
I don't want to be punching nobody's time clock.

466
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:24,108
怎么了? 清理垃圾配不起你吗?
What's the matter? You too good to carry people's rubbish?

467
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,044
你以为那十块是哪里来的?
Where you think that $10 you talking about comes from?

468
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,779
我就要去清理垃圾, 然后我赚的就给你
I'm just supposed to haul people's rubbish

469
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:29,547
就因为你太懒惰?
and give my money to you 'cause you too lazy to work?

470
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,049
你不去工作
You're too lazy to work

471
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,517
然后想知道你为何没钱
and want to know why you ain't got what I got.

472
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,318
Bonnie在哪间医院工作? 慈善医院?
What hospital Bonnie working at, Mercy?

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,220
她在Passavant医院里的洗衣房工作 [匹兹堡医疗中心大学]
She down at Passavant, working in the laundry.

474
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,122

I ain't got nothing as it is. I give you $10,

475
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:39,457
那我接下来一星期都吃豆吗?
I got to eat beans the rest of the week?

476
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,125
不, 你不会拿到那十块
No, you ain't getting no $10 over here.

477
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:42,527
不至于吃豆吧
You ain't got to be eating no beans.

478
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,062
真不知道你为何能说出这?
I don't know why you want to say that?

479
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,663
我没有多余的钱!

480
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:49,533
Gabe搬走了
Gabe done moved out,

481
00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:51,369
钱都替Pearl小姐交房租了

482
00:17:51,441 --> 00:17:52,341
我们都捉襟见肘了
Things done got tight around here.

483
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,272
我再也不能承担每次发薪金也给你
I can't afford to be giving you every payday.

484
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:55,473
我不是想你给我
I ain't asked you to give me nothing.

485
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:56,841
我是想你借给我
I asked you to loan me $10.

486
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:58,142
我知道你有十块的
I know you got $10.

487
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:00,311
我是有啊, 你知道为何吗?
Yeah, I got it. You know why I got it?

488
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,547
因为我到处乱花钱
'Cause I don't throw my money away on them streets.

489
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,582
你想过得快活, 当个音乐家
You want to live the fast life, being a musician,

490
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,417
有钱在俱乐部流连
running around in them clubs and things,

491
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,152
那就学懂照顾自己
then learn to take care of yourself.

492
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:11,289
你不会看到我请求别人帮忙
You ain't gone find me asking nobody for nothing!

493
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,527
这么都年来都没有
I spent too many years without.

494
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:14,557
你和我不同

497
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:20,269
没人欠你什么
Life don't owe you nothing.

498
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:23,201
是你欠自己的, 问问Bono, 他也懂
You owe it to yourself. Ask Bono. He'll tell you I'm right.

499
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,570
我们有各自生活的方式
You got your way of dealing with the world, I got mine.

500
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,505
我唯一在乎的是音乐
Only thing that matters to me is the music.

501
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,108
看得出来, 你吃什么不重要
Yeah, I can see that. Don't matter how you gonna eat,

502
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,409
哪来钱也不重要

你说得真对

I know I got to eat. But I got to live, too.

505
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,515
我需要点什么让我每天有动力
I need something that's gonna help me get out of bed in the morning,

506
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,317
让我感觉到我还存在
make me feel like I belong in the world.

507
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,190
我不打扰谁
I don't bother nobody.

508
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,091
我只是玩音乐而已
I just stay with my music

509
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,422
因为那是我生存于世的理由
'cause that's the only way I can find to live in the world.

510
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:47,225
不给就算了, 别跟我说要做什么
Otherwise, ain't no telling what I might do.

511
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:50,328
我不是来批评你和你的生活方式
I don't come by criticizing you and how you live.

512
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,263
是让你借十块给我

513
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:54,332
我不想听你说教
I don't want to hear all that about how I live.

514
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,868
天啊, 你母亲把你养得真好
Boy, your mama did a hell of a job raising you.

515
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,570
爸, 你改变不了我的, 我已经34岁了
You can't change me, pop. I'm 34 years old.

516
00:19:00,338 --> 00:19:01,839
如果你想改变我
If you wanted to change me,

517
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,474
或许你该在我成长时陪伴左右
you should have been there when I was growing up.

518
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,344
我来看你, 向你借十块
I come by to see you, ask you for $10,

519
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:09,247
而你却跟我说我是如何被养育成人?
and you want to talk about how I was raised?

520
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:12,650
你根本不知道是怎么一回事
You don't know nothing about how I was raised.

521
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,625
给他十块吧, Troy
Let the boy have $10, Troy.

522
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,932
你在看什么? 你知道我没有钱的
Hell you looking at? You know I ain't got no money.

523
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:29,901
你知道我把钱放在哪
You know what I do with my money.

524
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:31,702
给他吧, 如果你想的话
Go on, give him $10 if you want him to have it.

525
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:35,306
我会, 当你交给我的时候
I will, soon as you turn it loose.

526
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,178
这里
There it is.

527
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,313
$76.22
Seventy six dollars and twenty-two cents.

528
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,516
看到了吗, Bono? 我只能拿回$6
You see this, Bono? I ain't gonna get but six of that back.

529
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,686
够了吧, 拿着, Lyons
He ought to stop telling that lie. Here, Lyons.

530
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,221
谢谢, Rose
Thanks, Rose.

531
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,694
我要走了, 下次见
Look, I got to run. I'll see you all later.

532
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,197
等下, 你会说"谢谢, Rose"
Wait a minute. You gonna say, "thanks, Rose,"

533
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,965
但你不感谢付出的那个
but you ain't gonna look to see where she got that money from.

534
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,266
你看到他们怎对待我吗, Bono?
You see how they do me, Bono?

535
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:03,267
我知道是你的钱, 爸
I know she got it from you, pop.

536
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,823
谢谢, 我会还的
Thanks. I'll give it back to you.

537
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:05,807
看, 又撒谎了
There you go, telling another lie.

538
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:07,939
你还我$10时, 你还欠着$30呢
Time I see that $10, you'll be owing me $30 more.

539
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:09,774
- 再见, Bono先生   - 保重, Lyons
- See you, Mr. Bono.    - Take care, Lyons.

540
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,477
爸, 谢谢, 下次见
Thanks, pop. I'll see you again.

541
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,515
真不知道为何他不去工作
I don't know why that boy don't go and get him a decent job

542
00:20:17,587 --> 00:20:18,487
然后照顾他的女人
and take care of that woman he got.

543
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,552
他会找的, Troy, 那孩子还小
He'll be all right, Troy. The boy is still young!

544
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,391
那孩子34岁了
The boy is 34 years old.

545
00:20:23,393 --> 00:20:25,421
别又开始说了
Let's not get off into all that.

546
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:28,426
我要走了, Lucille在等着我
Look here, I got to go. I got to be going. Lucille gonna be waiting.

547
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,728
看到这女人了吗, Bono?
See this woman, Bono?

548
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,563
我爱她
I love this woman.

549
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,234
我爱得都有点痛了
I love her so much, it hurts.

550
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:40,304
我太爱她, 我都找不到方式表达了
I love her so much, I done run out of ways of loving her,

551
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:42,607
所以我要用回最简单的
so, I got to get back to basics.

552
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:44,442
你星期一早上别来
Don't you come by my house Monday morning,

553
00:20:44,514 --> 00:20:45,414
跟我说要上班了
talking about time to go to work.

554
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,745
- 因为我还抚摸她   - 够了, Troy
- 'Cause I'm gonna still be stroking.   - Troy, stop!

555
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,580
我也不在意, Rose
I ain't paying him no mind, Rose.

556
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,349
他只是醉了
That ain't nothing but gin talk.

557
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,451
即管吧, Troy! 星期一见
Go on, Troy! I'll see you Monday.

558
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:55,720
你别来, 朋友
老Don't you come by my house, nigger!

559
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:59,624
我跟你说过我到时候在做什么
I done told you what I'm gonna be doing!

560
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:04,262
星期二才来
Come back on Tuesday!

561
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,636
早安
Good morning.

562
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,672
我可以给你煮早餐, 你要吃吗?
You ready for breakfast? I can fix you some

563
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:50,074
在我挂起衣服后
soon as I finish hanging up these clothes.

564
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:52,043
我喝咖啡就行了
I got the coffee on. That's all right.

565
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:54,712
来点这个就行了
I just have some of that this morning.

566
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:59,383
昨天的彩票有结果了
That 651 hit yesterday.

567
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:02,320
Pearl小姐今个月第二次中了$1
That's the second time this month Miss Pearl hit for a dollar.

568
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,588
看来那些不需要的人总得到更多
Seems like those that need the least always get lucky.

569
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,144
贫穷的人反倒什么也没有
Poor folks can't get nothing.

570
00:22:06,174 --> 00:22:07,728
数字又不认人的
Them numbers don't know nobody.

571
00:22:07,758 --> 00:22:09,527
我不知道为你和Lyons都玩这个
I don't know why you fool with 'em, you and Lyons both.

572
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:11,062
用来消闲
Oh, it's something to do.

573
00:22:11,064 --> 00:22:13,531
你只不过在输钱而已
You ain't doing nothing but throwing your money away.

574
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,066
Troy, 你知道我能控制自己
Troy, you know I don't play foolishly.

575
00:22:15,068 --> 00:22:16,701
我就这里五分, 那里五分的玩
I just play a nickel here and a nickel there.

576
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:18,436
那你就花了一毛了
That's two nickels you done throwed away.

577
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:21,072
不全是, 我有时候会赢, 那就扯平了
Nah, I hit sometimes. That makes up for it.

578
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:22,844
赢了的话, 早晚会用到
Always comes in handy when I do hit.

579
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,645
赢的时候也不听见你抱怨
I don't hear you complaining then.

580
00:22:24,675 --> 00:22:25,810
我不是在抱怨, 我只是说这很愚蠢
I ain't complaining now. I just say it's foolish,

581
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:27,545
试着在六百种组合中
trying to guess out of 600 ways

582
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:29,113
猜出正确号码
which way the number gonna come.

583
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:30,748
如果我拿到这些黑人的...
If I had all the money these niggers...

584
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:38,456
非藉美国人一周放在上面的钱
You negroes throw away on numbers in one week,

585
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:41,425
只一星期, 我就会很有钱
just one week, I'd be a rich man.

586
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:42,760
你在这里说如果和认为是件蠢事
You wishing and calling it foolish

587
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:44,562
那些人也不会停下不玩
ain't gonna stop folks from playing the numbers.

588
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:46,664
我肯定
That's one thing for sure.

589
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:49,800
再者, 玩彩票也有好处的
Besides, some good things come from playing numbers.

590
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:51,102
看看Pope玩彩票
Look where Pope done bought him

591
00:22:51,104 --> 00:22:52,837
让他赚了一间餐厅
that restaurant off of numbers.

592
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:55,506
我不能接受这种人
I can't stand niggers like that.

593
00:22:55,508 --> 00:22:57,675
以前他没多少钱
Man ain't had two dimes to rub together.

594
00:22:57,677 --> 00:23:00,511
穿着那双破鞋漫目无的地走
He running around with his shoes all run-over,

595
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:02,580
到处问人拿香烟
bumming money for cigarettes.

596
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:05,583
好了, 中奖了
All right. Got lucky there, hit the numbers...

597
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:06,884
Troy, 我也知道
Troy, I know all about it.

598
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,452
我会说他很有理智
Had good sense. I'll say that for him.

599
00:23:08,524 --> 00:23:09,424
没把钱花光
Man ain't throw his money away.

600
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:13,724
我看过有人四天内用掉$2000
I done see niggers go through $2,000 in four days.

601
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,460
他建了间餐厅
Man built him that restaurant down there.

602
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:17,828
看上去棒极了
Fix it up real nice, too.

603
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,797
然后他不让有些人进去
Then he won't let nobody come in it.

604
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:22,433
他们不服务黑人
Negro go in there, can't get no kind of service.

605
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:25,669
看到有个白人进去点了炖肉汤
Seen a white fella go in there, he orders a bowl of stew.

606
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:27,905
Pope从大锅里为他放了很多肉
Pope pick all the meat out of the pot for him.

607
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,907
那白人的炖肉汤都是肉
Man ain't had nothing but a bowl of meat!

608
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,609
黑人进去点同样的
Negro go in there behind him,

609
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:33,644
只会换来马铃薯和萝卜
he ain't got nothing but the potatoes and the carrots.

610
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:35,780
还说玩彩票能得到什么
Talking about what numbers do for people.

611
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:37,181
你举了个坏的例子
You picked the wrong example there.

612
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:39,483
那只让他成为一个更傻的傻子
Ain't done nothing but made a worser fool out of him

613
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:41,419
比以前傻得多了
than he already was before.

614
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,488
Troy.
Troy.

615
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,756
你别再担心
You ought to stop worrying about

616
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,691
昨天工作时发生的事了
what happened at work yesterday.

617
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,429
我没在担心
I ain't worried.

618
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,865
他们只是叫我到理事长的办公室里
Just called me down there, the commissioner's office,

619
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:57,735
所有人都觉得我要被炒了
everybody's worried about them firing me.

620
00:23:57,737 --> 00:24:00,671
我不担心
I ain't worrying about them firing me.

621
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:02,873
你也别担心了
You ain't got to worry about that.

622
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,042
Cory在家吗?
Where's Cory? Cory in the house?

623
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,748
- Cory!    - 他出去了
- Cory!   - He gone out.

624
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,650
出去了是吧? 他出去
Out, huh? Yeah, he going out

625
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:15,653
是因为知道我想他筑起那藩篱
'cause he know I want him to work on this fence.

626
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:17,655
我知道他害怕工作
I know how he is. That boy is scared of working.

627
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:18,856
他这辈子都没工作过
He ain't done a lick of work in his life.

628
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:20,558
他要去练习美式足球
He had to go to football practice.

629
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,660
教练想在赛季开始前
Coach wanted them to get in a little extra practice

630
00:24:22,662 --> 00:24:23,861
多加练习
before the season start.

631
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:25,696
是啊, 我知道他在做怎样
Oh, yeah, I got his practice all right.

632
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:27,965
还没完成家务就出去
Running out of here before he gets his chores done.

633
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,767
Troy, 你怎么了?
Troy, what is wrong with you this morning?

634
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:30,739
什么事不合你意
Don't nothing set right with you.

635
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,504
回去睡足够才起来
Go on back in there, go to bed, and get up on the other side.

636
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:35,110
怎么是我有问题?
Why something got
to be wrong with me?

637
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,944
我没说我有什么问题
I ain't said nothing wrong with me.

638
00:24:36,072 --> 00:24:36,992
你对每件事都有意见
Well, you got something to say about everything.

639
00:24:37,022 --> 00:24:39,243
首先是彩票, 然后是那男人
First, it's the numbers, then it's the way the man

640
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:41,212
如何运作他的餐厅, 然后是Cory的事
run his restaurant, then you done got on Cory.

641
00:24:41,214 --> 00:24:42,813
下一样会是什么?
What's it gonna be next?

642
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,949
抬头看看天气合不合你意
Take a look up there, see if the weather suit you.

643
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:46,884
又或者抱怨你要在这
Or is it gonna be how you gonna put up this fence

644
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:47,952
挂满衣服的院子里筑起藩篱?
with the clothes hanging in the yard?

645
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:49,720
你说对了
You hit the nail on the head then.

646
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,822
当然, 我这么了解你
I know you like I know the back of my hand.

647
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,791
进来再喝杯咖啡
Come on in here and get you some more coffee,

648
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:55,559
看看能不能让你正常点
see if that don't straighten you up.

649
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:57,061
因为你今早很不对劲
'Cause you ain't right this morning.

650
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:47,711
是Troy, 嗨

651
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:50,915
嗨, Gabe

653
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:58,289
你拿着什么?

654
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:01,058
你想知道吗, Rose? 我有水果和蔬菜
You know what I got, Rose? I got fruits and vegetables.

655
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,993
你答应过给我的李子呢?
Where them plums you talking about?

656
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:06,797
我今天没有李子, 我刚才正唱着关于那个
I ain't got no plums today. I was just singing that.

657
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,634
我明天会带来, 我订了很多李子
I'll have some tomorrow. I put me in a big order for plums.

658
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:15,806
多到够分给圣彼得和所有人
I'll have enough plums tomorrow for Saint Peter and everybody!

659
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:17,975
Troy在生我的气
Troy mad at me.

660
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:20,778
Gabe, 我没有, 为何我要生气?
I ain't mad at you, Gabe. What I got to be mad at you about?

661
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,750
你又没对我做什么
You ain't done nothing to me.

662
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:26,350
我只是搬到了Pearl小姐那里
I just move over to Miss Pearl's to keep out from in your way.

663
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:27,785
我没什么打算
I ain't mean no harm by it.

664
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:29,320
谁说你有?
Who said anything about that?

665
00:26:29,322 --> 00:26:30,921
我可没有说什么
I ain't said nothing about that.

666
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,824
你不生我的气吗?
You ain't mad at me, is you?

667
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:38,629
我没有, 如果我有, 你会知道的
I ain't made at you, Gabe.
If I was mad at you, I'd tell you about it.

668
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:40,965
进来吧
Come on, get on out of the street. Come on.

669
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:48,739
我在地下室里有两间房, 我拥有自己的门
I got me two rooms in the basement. I got my own door, too.

670
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:51,141
你想看我的钥匙吗?
You want to seemy key?

671
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:56,614
那是我的钥匙, 没有人有同一样的
That's my own key. Ain't nobody else got a key like that.

672
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:58,349
那就是我两间房间的钥匙
That's my key for my two rooms.

673
00:26:58,351 --> 00:27:00,384
很好, 你有一把属于你的钥匙
That's good, Gabe. Got your own key, that's good.

674
00:27:00,456 --> 00:27:01,356
你饿吗?
You hungry, Gabe?

675
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:03,387
我刚在给Troy煮早餐
I was just fixing to cook Troy some breakfast.

676
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:04,755
我吃点饼干就好了
I'll take some biscuits.

677
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:06,090
你有饼干吗?
Ooh, you got some biscuits?

678
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,960
你知道我在天堂时
Did you know, when I was in heaven,

679
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,962
我和圣彼得每早
every morning, me and Saint Peter

680
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:15,933
都会坐在门口, 吃点饼干吗?
would sit down by the gate and eat some big, fat biscuits?

681
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:18,035
那时候真棒
Oh, yeah, we had us a good time.

682
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:20,404
我们就坐着, 然后吃回饼干
We'd sit there and eat us them biscuits.

683
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:23,040
然后圣彼得会去睡一会
And then Saint Peter would go off to sleep,

684
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:24,842
叫我到审判的时候
and tell me to wake him up

685
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:27,044
叫醒他
when it's time to open the gates for the judgment.

686
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:31,782
进来吧, 我会一大堆饼干给你
Well, come on, I'll make you a big batch of biscuits.

687
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:35,786
Troy, 我看到圣彼得的名册上有你的名字
Hey, Troy. Saint Peter got your name in his book. I seen it.

688
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:37,888
写着Troy Maxson
It say, "Troy Maxson."

689
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,857
我跟他说: 我认识他
I say, "i know him.

690
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:43,127
我们有同样的姓 [Maxson]
He got the same name like what I got.

691
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:45,195
那是我的兄长
"That's my brother."

692
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:48,999
你要跟我说多少次这故事?
How many times you gonna tell me that, Gabe?

693
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:52,069
名册上没有我的名字, 不会有的
Ain't got my name in the book. Don't have to have my name.

694
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:54,438
我死过了, 也到过天堂
I done died and went to heaven.

695
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,675
但他有你的名字
But he got your name, though.

696
00:27:57,677 --> 00:28:00,978
一天早上, 圣彼得在看他的名册
One morning, Saint Peter was looking at his book,

697
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,781
他在准备审判的到来
and he was marking it up for the judgment,

698
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:05,883
他让我看了你的名字
and he let me see your name.

699
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:08,819
在M的那一类别下
He got it in there under "M."

700
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:10,854
也有Rose的名字
He got Rose's name.

701
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:14,124
我没有亲眼看到, 但我知道的
I ain't seen it like I seen yours, but I know it's in there.

702
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:17,895
他有本很大的名册
He got a great big book! Whoo!

703
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:20,764
上面有所有存在过的人的名字
He got everybody's name what was ever been born.

704
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:21,999
他亲口告诉我的

705
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:25,936
但我亲眼看到你的名字
But I seen your name. I seen it with my own eye.

706
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:26,908
进去吧
Come in the house.

707
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:28,472
Rose会煮点什么给你吃
Rose gonna fix you something to eat now.

708
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:31,008
我不饿, 我吃了早餐了
I ain't hungry. I done had breakfast

709
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,044
和Jemima姨姨吃

710
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:37,181
她过来, 为我煮了很多烙饼
She come by, cook me up a whole mess of flapjacks!

711
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:39,049

All right. Come on, let's go in the house. Rose fix us...

712
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,751
还记得我们以前怎么吃烙饼吗?

713
00:28:40,753 --> 00:28:41,919
记得, 进来吧
Yes, I remember. Come on now.

714
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:43,053
- 我要走了   - Gabe!
- I got to go!   - Gabe!

715
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,822
- 我要走了   - Gabe, 进来吧
- I got to go!   - Gabe, come on now!

716
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:47,758
我要去卖李子
I got to go sell my plums!

717
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,793
我卖了点蕃茄
I done sold some tomatoes.

718
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:51,762
赚了五角, 想看吗?
Got me two quarters. Want to see?

719
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,264
我要储起来买个新喇叭
I'm gonna save 'em and buy me a new horn,

720
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:59,203
好让到审判时, 圣彼得能听到
so Saint Peter can hear me when it's time to open the gate.

721
00:28:59,205 --> 00:29:00,904
你听到吗?
You hear that?

722
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:05,976
是地狱之犬
You hear that? That's the hellhound.

723
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:07,811
我要把它们赶走
I'm gonna chase them out of here.

724
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:11,849
走啊! 别来这!
Go on! Get out of here! Get out! Get out!

725
00:29:17,813 --> 00:29:18,849
[诗歌]

726
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,809
Gabe在哪?
Where's Gabe?

727
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:13,811
他又到处跑了
He's gone off somewhere.

728
00:30:17,146 --> 00:30:17,947
他没有好好吃饭
He ain't eating right.

729
00:30:17,948 --> 00:30:19,316
Pearl小姐说他不肯吃
Miss Pearl say she can't get him to eat nothing.

730
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:20,884
你想我怎样?
What you want me to do about it, Rose?

731
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:22,586
我为他做了我能做的事
I did everything I could for the man.

732
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:24,254
我不能让他康复
I can't make him get well.

733
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:27,558
打仗时他被伤及脑袋了, 你想他怎样?
Man got half his head blown off, what you expect?

734
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,293
有些事还是能为他做的
Seems like something ought to be done to help him.

735
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:30,894
他也不打扰谁
The man don't bother nobody.

736
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:33,163
因为他的脑袋里有块金属碎片
He just mixed up 'cause of that metal plate

737
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:36,033
所以他才疯疯癫癫, 没理由...
he got in his head. Ain't no sense in...

738
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:39,136
谢谢, 没理由让他住在医院
Thank you. Ain't no sense in sending him to the hospital.

739
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,337
至少他会吃点什么
At least he'd be eating right.

740
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,039
他们会照顾他
They could help him take care of himself.

741
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:43,607
没有人想被锁起来
Don't nobody want to be locked up, Rose.

742
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:45,609
你为何想锁起他?
What you want to lock the man up for?

743
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:47,244
他上战场
Man going down there,

744
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:51,615
跟日本人打仗
over there and fight that war, messing with them japs,

745
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:53,283
炸伤了脑袋
getting half his head blown off.

746
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:57,154
他们随便赔了三千块, 我都接受了
They give him a lousy $3,000. I got to swoop down on that.

747
00:30:57,156 --> 00:30:59,589
你又要说这个了吗?
Is you fixing to get into that again?

748
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:00,858
他的脑袋里有块金属碎片
He got a metal plate in his head.

749
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,926
而那就是我得到这间房子的原因
That's the only reason I got a roof over my head

750
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:04,361
就因为那金属碎片
is 'cause of that metal plate.

751
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,296
你没理由自责的
Ain't no sense in you blaming yourself for nothing.

752
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:08,632
他不能管理好那笔钱
Gabe was in no condition to manage that money.

753
00:31:08,704 --> 00:31:09,604
你为他做了正确的事
You done what was right by him.

754
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:12,035
没人能说你不是
Can't nobody say you ain't done what was right by him.

755
00:31:12,107 --> 00:31:13,007
看看你照顾他多久了
Look how long you took care of him.

756
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:16,173
一直至到他想要有自己的地方, 才搬去Pearl小姐那
Till he wanted his own place
and moved over there with Miss Pearl.

757
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:18,909
女人, 那不是我想说的, 我只是...
That ain't what I'm saying, woman. I'm just...

758
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,913
我只是在说事实
I'm just stating the facts.

759
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:25,015
要是我的弟弟没有受伤
If my brother didn't have a metal plate in his head,

760
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:26,350
我就不会有上厕所的地方
I wouldn't have a pot to piss in

761
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:28,018
不会有个后院
or a window to throw it out of.

762
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,920
我都53岁了...
And I'm 53...

763
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,231
你要去哪?
Where you going off to?

764
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,100
你近期每个星期六都出去
You been running out of here every Saturday for weeks.

765
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:46,036
我以为你会筑起那藩篱
I thought you were gonna work on this fence.

766
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:48,906
我去Taylor的酒吧里
I'm gonna go down to Taylors' and, uh...

767
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:38,422
妈妈?
Mama?

768
00:32:38,424 --> 00:32:42,993
Cory, 你爸爸对你今早还没完成家务
Oh, Cory. Your daddy like to have a fit with you

769
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:45,729
就跑出去非常愤怒
running out of here this morning without doing your chores.

770
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:46,701
你还好吗?
You all right?

771
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:50,434
他说你本该帮忙筑起藩篱
He say you supposed to be helping him with the fence.

772
00:32:50,506 --> 00:32:52,106
我说过要去练习啊
I told you I had to go to practice.

773
00:32:52,436 --> 00:32:54,137
他过去几个星期六都这样说
And he's been saying that the last four or five Saturdays,

774
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:57,240
然后就跑到Taylor的酒吧
and then don't ever do nothing but go down to Taylors'.

775
00:32:58,509 --> 00:32:59,710
你有跟他说录取的事吗?
You told him about the recruiter?

776
00:32:59,712 --> 00:33:01,278
有
Yeah, I told him.

777
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,447
- 那他怎么说? - 他没说什么
- Well, what'd he say? - He didn't say nothing too much.

778
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:06,283
在他回来前快完成家务
Go on and get started on your chores before he gets back here.

779
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:09,052
在他回来又要抱怨前
Go on and scrub down them steps

780
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:12,055
快去刷刷地板
before he come back here hollering and carrying on!

781
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:14,024
现在啊, 小子
Go! Boy, go!

782
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,750
继续吧, Troy, 你早晚会把我吓死的
Go on, Troy. You liked to scare me to death.

783
00:33:39,822 --> 00:33:40,922
比赛怎么了?
What was the score of the game?

784
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:43,086
Lucille在电话说过, 但我没留意
Lucille had me on the phone. I couldn't keep up with it.

785
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:45,488
我为何在意比赛了? 来吧, 女人
What do I care about the game? Come here, woman.

786
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:45,956
我以为你去Taylor那里
I thought you went down to Taylors'

787
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:47,491
就是为了看比赛, 让我走
to listen to the game. Go on, Troy.

788
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:49,426
我以为你要筑起那藩篱
I thought you're supposed to be putting up the fence.

789
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:52,029
我会去的, 在我处理好...
I'll put it up when I finish with what...

790
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,231
我手上的事
Is at hand.

791
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,400
快去吧, 真不懂你的
Go on, Troy. I ain't studying you!

792
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:59,436
但我懂你, 我会好好的弄清楚你
I'm studying you. I'm finna do my homework.

793
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:01,304
够了
Troy, you better leave me alone!

794
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,442
Cory回来了吗?
Where Cory? That boy brought his butt home yet?

795
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:07,110
他在上面做家务
He's upstairs doing his chores.

796
00:34:07,112 --> 00:34:08,345
Cory, 快下来...
Cory, get your butt...

797
00:34:09,782 --> 00:34:12,115
- 你去哪?   - 很快会来
- Where you going?   - I'll be right back.

798
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:14,584
- 何时?   - 就街口那
- When?   - I'm just going right down the street.

799
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,522
去哪? 跟谁?
Where? Who?

800
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:23,022
Troy, 进去吧
Troy, go in the house.

801
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:52,856
你到现在才回来吗?
You just now coming here from leaving this morning?

802
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:54,458
- 对, 我要去练习   - 对什么?
- Yeah, I had to go to football practice... - Yeah, what?

803
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,430
对, 先生
Yes, sir.

804
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,227
我才不看你一会
I ain't but two seconds off you, no way.

805
00:34:57,229 --> 00:34:58,862
那垃圾箱都要满了
That garbage sitting in there, overflowing.

806
00:34:58,864 --> 00:35:00,267
你没做过家务
You ain't done none of your chores.

807
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:01,297
现在也没礼貌
Now you come in here, talking about, "yeah."

808
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,166
我刚想做, 爸
I was just getting ready to do my chores now, pop.

809
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:05,402
你的首要是星期六帮我筑起藩篱
Your first chore is to help me with this fence on Saturday.

810
00:35:05,404 --> 00:35:07,170
所有事都放在那之后
Everything else come after that.

811
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:09,473
去拿木锯, 我们要锯开这些木板
Now, get that saw, we gonna cut these boards.

812
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:14,578
嘿, 爸
Hey, pop.

813
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,480
你为何不买电视?
Why don't you buy a TV?

814
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:19,182
我要来做什么?
What I want with a TV? What I want one of them for?

815
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:22,152
现在每人家里都有一台
Everybody got one. Earl, Ba Bra, Jesse.

816
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:24,321
我不是在问谁有电视, 我是问要来做什么?
I ain't asked who had one, I said what I want with one?

817
00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:26,656
所以你可以看啊, 现在有很多不同的节目
So, you can watch it. They got lots of things on TV.

818
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:28,225
- 棒球也有   - 是吗?
- Baseball and everything.   - Yeah?

819
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:29,459
我们可以看世界大赛
We could watch the world series.

820
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,528
- 那买电视要多少钱?    - 我不清楚
- Yeah, how much this TV cost?   - I don't know.

821
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,331
我看见过优惠价二百块
They got 'em on sale for about $200.

822
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:36,166
- 二百块?   - 那不算贵, 爸
- $200?   - That ain't that much, pop.

823
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:38,568
是啊, 才二百块而已
No, that's just $200.

824
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:41,705
你有留意那屋顶吗?
You see that roof you got sitting over your head at night?

825
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,174
我来告诉你那屋顶的事
Let me tell you something about that roof.

826
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:48,145
那屋顶已经十年没涂上焦油了
It's been 10 years since that roof was last tarred.

827
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:49,613
然后到了冬天下雪时
See, now snow come this winter,

828
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:51,281
雪积聚在屋顶上
sit up on that roof like it is,

829
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:53,316
然后一点点的慢慢地渗透到里面
it's gonna seep inside, just gonna be a little bit,

830
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,451
你甚至不会注意到
you ain't gonna hardly notice it,

831
00:35:54,523 --> 00:35:55,523
然后当你发现时
then next thing you know,

832
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,287
早已渗透到各处
it's gonna be leaking all over the house.

833
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:59,356
然后因为积水, 木材会腐蚀
Then the wood rot from all that water,

834
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:01,358
到时候你就需要把整个屋顶换掉
and you gonna need a whole new roof.

835
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,493
你猜要多少才能修好?
Now how much you think it cost to get that roof fixed?

836
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:07,697
- 我不知道   - $264现金, 明白了吗?
- I don't know.   - $264 cash money. See?

837
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,566
当你在想买电视
While you be thinking about a TV,

838
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:11,301
我就得担心头上的屋顶
I got to be thinking about the roof

839
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:13,904
又或是要修理的东西
or whatever else go wrong around here.

840
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:15,906
如果你有二百块, 你会怎做?
Now if you had $200, what would you do?

841
00:36:15,908 --> 00:36:18,375
修理屋顶还是买电视?
Fix the roof, or buy a TV?

842
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:20,710
买电视, 当屋顶开始渗水时
I'd buy a TV. And when the roof started to leak,

843
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:22,312
我才修理它
if it needed fixing, I'd fix it.

844
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:23,613
你哪来的钱?
Where you gonna get your money from?

845
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:24,386
你都花在买电视上了
You done spent it on a TV.

846
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:26,187
到时候你在里面
You gonna sit up in there,

847
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,518
看着漏水滴到你的新电视上吗?
let that water run all over your brand-new TV?

848
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,287
爸, 我知道你有钱的
Pop, you got the money. I know you do.

849
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:31,955
- 在哪?    - 银行里
- Where I got it at, huh?   - In the bank.

850
00:36:32,027 --> 00:36:33,227
你想看我的存摺吗?
You want to see my bank book?

851
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:36,326
你想看我那$73.22的存款吗?
You want to see that $73.22 I got sitting up in there?

852
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:37,961
你不需要一次付清
You don't have to pay for it all at one time.

853
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:39,930
可以先给首期, 之后分期付款
You can put a down payment on it, and carry it on with you.

854
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:42,632
除非情况紧急, 我才不会让自己欠别人东西
Not me. I ain't owing nobody nothing if I can help it.

855
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:45,402
迟了付款, 他们就会来带走它
Miss a payment, they come and snatch it right out of your house.

856
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:48,505
那你就白付了, 明白了吗?
Then what you got, huh? See?

857
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:52,242
如果我有整整$200块, 我会选择买电视
Now, when I get $200 clear, I'll buy me a TV.

858
00:36:52,244 --> 00:36:55,545
要是我手上有$264块, 我就会选择修理屋顶
Right now, when I get $264, I'm gonna get that roof fixed.

859
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,613
爸...
Oh, pop...

860
00:36:56,615 --> 00:36:58,215
如果你想买电视
You go get you $200

861
00:36:58,217 --> 00:36:59,449
就自己赚$200块
and buy you a TV if you want to.

862
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:01,251
我的钱要花在更实用的地方
I got better things to do with my money.

863
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:03,486
我赚不到$200, 我甚至没见过$200
I can't get $200. I ain't never seen $200.

864
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,222
好吧, 我跟你说
All right, I'll tell you what.

865
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:08,425
我们各人付$100
You get $100, I'll put the other $100 with it.

866
00:37:08,497 --> 00:37:09,697
好吧, 等着我
All right, I'm gonna show you.

867
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:13,363
现在给我看你如何切开这些木板
Yeah, show me how you can cut these boards right now.

868
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,499
拿着, 那值$200块
There you go. That's $200 worth.

869
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,074
- 匹兹堡海盗队今天赢了   - 是吗?
- The Pirates won today.   - Yeah?

870
00:37:21,104 --> 00:37:22,742
连续赢五场了
That makes five in a row.

871
00:37:22,772 --> 00:37:24,574
我没在意海盗队, 他们都只有白人球员
I ain't thinking about no Pirates. They got an all-white team.

872
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:28,445
他们有个波多黎各的球员, Clemente是吧?
Got that boy, though, that Puerto Rican boy, Clemente?

873
00:37:28,578 --> 00:37:30,579
也不让他出出场
Don't even half play him.

874
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,481
如果给那孩子机会, 他会是位伟大的球员
That boy could be something if they'd give him a chance.

875
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:33,984
让他上一天场, 隔天又坐板凳了
Play him one day, sit him on the bench the next.

876
00:37:34,056 --> 00:37:35,556
他也常上场啊
He gets lots of chances to play.

877
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,320
我在说每天都上场, 当正选
I'm talking about playing every day, playing regular,

878
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:38,989
这才能学到更多啊
so you can get your timing, that's what I'm talking about.

879
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:41,291
他们队里也有些白人不是每天都能上场
They got some white guys on the team that don't play every day.

880
00:37:41,363 --> 00:37:42,663
你总不能让全部人上场
You can't play everybody at the same time.

881
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:44,461
如果有个白人球员是当后备的
If they got a white fellow sitting on the bench,

882
00:37:44,463 --> 00:37:47,030
你可以肯定他根本不会打棒球
you can bet your last dollar he can't play.

883
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:49,332
有色人种要出色两倍才能当正选
Colored guy got to be twice as good to get on the team.

884
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:52,035
那就是我不想你进球队的原因
That's why I don't want you getting all tied up in them sports.

885
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:54,337
进去了又如何?
Man on the team, what it get him?

886
00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:56,339
球队的有色人种不被重用
Got colored on the team, don't even use him.

887
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:59,042
如同没有他们一样, 所有球队都是这样的
Same as not having them. All them teams the same.

888
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:01,478
亚特兰大勇士队也有Hank Aaron和Wes Covington
The Braves got Hank Aaron and Wes Covington.

889
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,580
Hank Aaron已经有43个全垒打了, 算上今天两个的话
Hank Aaron hit two home runs today. That makes 43.

890
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:05,582
Aaron不算什么, 那是你该做的
Aaron ain't nobody. That's what you supposed to do.

891
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:07,484
你该全力以赴
That's how the game's supposed to be played.

892
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:08,785
没别的, 不过是
Ain't nothing to it. It's a matter of getting

893
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,387
抓准时机然后挥棒
your timing and follow through.

894
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:12,522
我现在也可以打43个全垒打
Hell, I can hit 43 home runs right now.

895
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:14,057
你不能在美国职业棒球大联盟里打得出来
Not off no Major-League pitcher, you couldn't.

896
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:15,659
我们在黑人联盟里有更强的投手
We had better pitching in the negro leagues.

897
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:17,594
我在Satchel Paige身上打过七次全垒打
I hit seven home runs off of Satchel Paige.

898
00:38:17,666 --> 00:38:18,966
你不会找到比他更好的球员
You can't get no better than that.

899
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,630
Sandy Koufax, 他是联盟里三振次数最多的
Sandy Koufax, he leading the league in strikeouts.

900
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,365
我不是在想Sandy Koufax的事
I ain't thinking about no Sandy Koufax.

901
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:24,034
还有Warren Spahn和Lew Burdette, 我猜你...
You got Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette. I bet you...

902
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:25,468
我不想再说了
I'm through with it now.

903
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:31,875
去锯木板吧
Go and cut them boards.

904
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:37,514
你妈妈跟我说你被大学美式足球队录取了
Your mama told me you got recruited by a college football team.

905
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:38,815
真有此事吗?
Is that right?

906
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,383
对, Zellman教练说
Yeah, coach Zellman say

907
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:42,385
晚点会有负责人跟你商讨
the recruiter gonna be coming by to talk to you.

908
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:44,487
让你签同意书
Get you to sign the permission papers.

909
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,056
我以为你会在A&P里工作
I thought you was supposed to be working down the A&P.

910
00:38:46,058 --> 00:38:47,724
你放学后不是应该到那里工作吗?
Ain't you supposed to be working down there after school?

911
00:38:47,726 --> 00:38:49,626
Stawicki先生说他会替我留着位子
Mr. Stawicki say he gonna hold my job for me

912
00:38:49,628 --> 00:38:51,394
直到赛季结束
until after the football season.

913
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:53,730
他说下周起, 我可以只上周末的班
He said starting next week, I can work weekends.

914
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:56,733
小子, 我以为我们说好了
Boy, I thought we had an understanding about this football stuff.

915
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:58,601
你应该继续完成家务
You supposed to keep up with your chores,

916
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:00,537
继续在A&P工作
hold your job down there at the A&P.

917
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:02,706
你今天大半天不在
You ain't been around here all day on a Saturday,

918
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:04,074
也没完成家务
ain't none of your chores done.

919
00:39:04,076 --> 00:39:05,809
现在你说你辞职了?
Now you come telling me you done quit your job?

920
00:39:05,811 --> 00:39:07,877
- 我周末也会上班啊   - 当然了
- I'm gonna be working weekends. - You damn right you are!

921
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:09,813
那负责人也不必到来
And ain't no need for nobody to be coming around here,

922
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:11,348
跟我说签署的事
talking to me about signing nothing.

923
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,420
爸, 你不能这样做
Pop, you can't do that.

924
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,683
他大老远从北卡罗莱纳州来
He's coming all the way from north Carolina.

925
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,652
我才不在乎
I don't care where he coming from!

926
00:39:15,654 --> 00:39:16,820
听着, 小子
Look, boy,

927
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,522
那些白人无论如何也不会让你
the white man ain't gonna let you

928
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,458
碰美式足球的
get nowhere with no football no way.

929
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,827
你继续你的学业, 所以你可以...
Now you get your book-learning, so you can, uh,

930
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:26,830
在A&P有进升的机会, 还有学习维修车子
work your way up at the A&P
and learn how to fix cars,

931
00:39:26,832 --> 00:39:28,698
或者建筑, 让自己有一技傍身
or build houses, get you a trade.

932
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,434
那样你才有竞争力
This way, you got something can't nobody take away from you.

933
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:33,770
你的双手
You go in and learn how to put your hands to good use

934
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:35,739
该做比清理垃圾更好的工作
besides hauling other people's garbage.

935
00:39:35,811 --> 00:39:36,911
我的成绩很好, 爸
I get good grades, pop.

936
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,475
那就是他们会跟你商讨的原因
That's why the recruiter want to talk with you.

937
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:39,909
你的成绩也要好才能被录取的
You got to keep up your grades to get recruited.

938
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:41,845
这样我就有机会上大学
This way, I'll be going to college, I'll get a chance.

939
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:45,582
首先, 你去A&P那拿回你的工作
First, you get your butt down there and get your job back.

940
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:46,883
Stawicki先生已经聘请了其他人
Mr. Stawicki done already hired somebody else

941
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,618
因为我跟他说我要打美式足球
'cause I told him I was playing football.

942
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,888
我比我想像中还蠢
You a bigger fool than I thought.

943
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,124
你竟然让别人代替了你的位置
You gonna let somebody take away your job,

944
00:39:54,126 --> 00:39:55,592
好让你能打什么美式足球
so you can play some football.

945
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,460
你上哪赚钱
Where you gonna get your money

946
00:39:57,462 --> 00:39:58,795
照顾你的女友什么的?
to take care of your girlfriend and whatnot?

947
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:00,463
到底有多蠢
What kind of foolishness is that

948
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:01,765
才会让别人代替了自己?
to let somebody take away your job?

949
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:03,166
我周末还是会去工作的
I'm still gonna be working weekends.

950
00:40:03,168 --> 00:40:05,468
不, 你去找另一份工作
No. You getting out of here and finding you another job.

951
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,640
别这样, 爸, 我还得练习呢
Come on, pop. I gotta practice.

952
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,605
我不能同时工作和练习
I can't work after school and play football, too.

953
00:40:08,607 --> 00:40:10,140
Zellman教练说球队需要我
The team needs me, that's what Coach Zellman say.

954
00:40:10,142 --> 00:40:12,475
我才不介意他说什么, 我说了算, 明白了吗?
I don't care what nobody say. I'm the boss. You understand?

955
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:15,712
我是你的父亲, 我说的才算
I'm the boss around here. I do the only saying what counts.

956
00:40:15,714 --> 00:40:18,181
- 别这样...    - 我问你: 你明白了吗?
- Come on...  - I asked you, "do you understand?"

957
00:40:18,183 --> 00:40:21,184
- 明白   - 什么?
- Yeah.   - What?

958
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:24,521
- 明白, 先生    - 好了
- Yes, sir.   - All right.

959
00:40:24,523 --> 00:40:27,760
你去A&P看看能不能取回你的工作
You get on down there to that A&P and see if you can get your job back.

960
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:30,193
如果只能二选其一, 那就放弃进球队吧
If you can't do both, then you quit the football team.

961
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:32,495
人生不如意事十常八九
You got to take the crookeds with the straights.

962
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:33,696
明白, 先生
Yes, sir.

963
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,739
我可以问你点事吗?
Can I ask you a question?

964
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:44,507
你又要问什么?
What the hell you got to ask me?

965
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:47,210
你该问Stawicki先生工作的事
Mr. Stawicki the one you got the questions for.

966
00:40:47,212 --> 00:40:48,812
你为何从不喜欢我?
How come you ain't never liked me?

967
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:54,451
喜欢你? 谁说我一定要喜欢你?
Like you? Who the hell said I got to like you?

968
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:57,854
有什么规定要我一定要喜欢你?
What law is there say I got to like you?

969
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,222
既然站在我面前
You want to stand up in front of my face

970
00:40:59,224 --> 00:41:00,957
问这蠢极了的问题
and ask a damn fool-ass question like that.

971
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,525
还扯什么喜欢谁
Talk about liking somebody.

972
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:03,827
说话时站近点, 小子
Come here, boy, when I talk to you.

973
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:10,700
该死的, 站好, 我问你
Straighten up, god damn it! I asked you a question.

974
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:13,736
- 有什么规定要我一定要喜欢你?   - 没有
- What law is there say I got to like you?   - None.

975
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:15,805
正是, 你三餐温饱吗?
All right, then. Don't you eat every day?

976
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,675
我问你问题时, 你就得回答我
Answer me when I talk to you.

977
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:19,742
- 你三餐温饱吗?   - 对
- Don't you eat every day?   - Yeah.

978
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:21,611
小子, 你一天在我的地方
Nigger, as long as you in my house,

979
00:41:21,613 --> 00:41:23,680
你就得加在句子最后加上"先生"
you put a "Sir" on the end of it when you talk to me.

980
00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:24,981
- 是, 先生   - 你每天都有饭吃?
- Yes, sir.   - You eat every day?

981
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,583
- 是, 先生    - 有地方住?
- Yes, sir.   - Got a roof over your head?

982
00:41:26,585 --> 00:41:27,750
- 是, 先生   - 有衣服穿?
- Yes, sir.   - Got clothes on your back?

983
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:29,552
- 是, 先生   - 原因呢?
- Yes, sir.   - Why you think that is?

984
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:31,688
- 全因为你   - 我当然知道是因为我
- 'Cause of you.   - Hell, I know it's 'cause of me.

985
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,957
但你认为是因为什么?
But why do you think that is?

986
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:36,993
因为你喜欢我?
'Cause you like me?

987
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,995
"喜欢"你
"Like" you.

988
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,964
我每天一大清早出去工作
I go out of here every morning,

989
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:44,567
还得时时刻刻忍受那些白人 [crackers带侮辱之意]
I bust my butt putting up with them crackers every day

990
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:46,236
才算得上"喜欢"你
'cause I "like" you.

991
00:41:46,238 --> 00:41:49,539
你简直是我见过最愚蠢的人, 那是我的职责
You about the biggest fool I ever saw. It's my job.

992
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:51,274
我的责任
It's my responsibility.

993
00:41:51,276 --> 00:41:54,277
一个男人就该照顾他的家庭
A man is supposed to take care of his family.

994
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:57,247
你住在我的房子里, 吃我买回来的食物
You live in my house, fill your belly with my food,

995
00:41:57,249 --> 00:42:00,884
我照顾你是因为你是我的儿子啊
put your behind on my bed because you're my son.

996
00:42:00,886 --> 00:42:03,820
而不是我喜欢你, 照顾你是我的职责
Not 'cause I like you. 'Cause it's my duty to take care of you.

997
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:06,589
我得承担起这个责任
I owe a responsibility to you.

998
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:08,591
现在我就说清楚
Now, let's get this straight right here and now,

999
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:09,993
以免你将来又说同样的话
before it go along any further.

1000
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:11,694
我不需要喜欢你
I ain't got to like you.

1001
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:14,831
Rand先生每星期发薪给我不是因为他喜欢我
Mr. Rand don't give me my money come payday 'cause he like me.

1002
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:17,934
是因为他欠我的
He give it to me 'cause he owe me.

1003
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:20,003
现在我已给了所有我该给你的
Now I done give you everything I got to give you.

1004
00:42:20,005 --> 00:42:22,575
我把你带到这个世界上啊!
I give you your life!

1005
00:42:22,577 --> 00:42:24,505
你妈妈和我都商讨好各自的职责
Me and your mama worked that out between us,

1006
00:42:24,607 --> 00:42:27,310
而喜欢你不是我的工作之一
and liking your black ass wasn't part of the bargain.

1007
00:42:27,382 --> 00:42:28,482
你从今起别再
Now don't you go through life

1008
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:31,014
担心别人是否喜欢你
worrying about whether somebody like you, or not.

1009
00:42:31,016 --> 00:42:34,284
你该想他们没有负了你
You best be making sure they're doing right by you.

1010
00:42:34,356 --> 00:42:35,656
- 明白了吗?   - 明白, 先生
- You understand what I'm saying?   - Yes, sir.

1011
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:39,689
那现在滚开, 去A&P拿回你的工作
Then get the hell out of my face and get on down to that A&P!

1012
00:43:02,147 --> 00:43:05,348
你为何就不让那孩子打美式足球呢, Troy?
Why don't you go ahead and let the boy play football, Troy?

1013
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:07,350
他只想像你一样在运动有点成就
He just want to be like you with the sports.

1014
00:43:07,352 --> 00:43:09,652
我不想他重蹈覆辙
I don't want him to be like me.

1015
00:43:09,654 --> 00:43:11,087
我想他走条和我完全不同的路
I want him to get as far away from my life

1016
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:12,259
越不同越好
as he possibly can get.

1017
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:14,724
你是我生命中唯一遇过的好事, Rose
You the only decent thing ever happened to me, Rose.

1018
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:16,693
我希望他找个像你一样好的女人
And I wish him that.

1019
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:20,129
除此之外我不希望他像我一样
But I don't wish him nothing else from my life.

1020
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,732
我在他出生的那天就决定
I decided 17 years ago,

1021
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:25,101
那孩子不要参与什么运动
that boy wasn't gonna get involved in no sports.

1022
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,903
在我明白运动里的不公之后
Not after what they did to me in the sports.

1023
00:43:26,905 --> 00:43:29,105
你为何就不承认你当时不能进职业联盟是因为年纪?
Why don't you just admit you were too old for the Major Leagues?

1024
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,907
就承认一次?
For once, why don't you just admit that?

1025
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:32,742
别跟我来年纪这套
Don't you come tellin' me I was too old.

1026
00:43:32,744 --> 00:43:35,979
是因为我是有色人种而已, 我现在都53岁了
I just wasn't the right color. Hell, I'm 53 years old,

1027
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:39,082
但我肯定我能打出比S的.269更好的成绩
I can do better than Selkirk's .269 right now.

1028
00:43:39,084 --> 00:43:41,718
过了40岁还怎样打棒球?
How were you gonna play ball when you were over 40?

1029
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,353
有时候你说的话真不合逻辑
Sometimes, I can't get no sense out of you.

1030
00:43:43,425 --> 00:43:44,525
我很清醒, 女人
I got good sense, woman.

1031
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:47,890
我清楚知道别让运动伤了他的身心
I got sense enough not to let that boy get hurt playing no sports.

1032
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:49,659
你太疼爱他了
You mothering the boy too much.

1033
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:51,828
让他老是担心别人是否喜欢自己
Worrying about whether people "like" him or not.

1034
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:54,998
那孩子做的所有事, 都是为了给你看
Everything that boy do, he do for you.

1035
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,800
他想你称赞他, 仅此而已
He wants you to say, "good job, son." That's all.

1036
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:01,137
Rose, 我没时间做这些事, 他好好的活着
I ain't got time for that, Rose. He's alive, he's healthy.

1037
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:04,807
就得自己找出路, 我也得继续自己的生活
He's got to make his own way. I made mine.

1038
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:05,975
他将来出社会后
Ain't nobody gonna hold his hand

1039
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,377
没有人会时常照顾他的
when he get out there in the world.

1040
00:44:07,379 --> 00:44:09,846
Troy, 时代不同了
Times have changed, Troy.

1041
00:44:09,848 --> 00:44:11,948
人会变的
People change.

1042
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:14,183
世界在变, 而你根本不知道
The world changing, and you can't even see it.

1043
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,726
女人, 我尽我所能地工作
Woman, I do the best I can do.

1044
00:44:23,728 --> 00:44:24,994
每星期五我带着
I come in here every Friday,

1045
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:27,930
一袋马铃薯和一桶猪油回来
I carry a sack of potatoes and a bucket of lard.

1046
00:44:27,932 --> 00:44:31,734
你们才得以不用工作
You all line up at the door with your hands out.

1047
00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:33,436
我连最后的钱都用在你们身上
I give you the lint from my pockets.

1048
00:44:33,438 --> 00:44:35,171
我付出了我的血汗
I give you my sweat and my blood.

1049
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:37,974
我无法给你们同情, 早已用光了
I ain't got no tears. I done spent them.

1050
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:40,777
我们晚上到楼上做爱
We go upstairs in that room at night, I fall down on you

1051
00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:44,147
在你里面给了我唯一所剩的
and try to blast a hole into forever.

1052
00:44:44,149 --> 00:44:46,749
星期一早上起来, 带着桌上煮好的午餐
I get up Monday morning, find my lunch on the table,

1053
00:44:46,751 --> 00:44:48,017
出去继续我的生活
go out and make my way.

1054
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:52,422
试着捱到星期五
Find my strength to get me through to next Friday.

1055
00:44:52,424 --> 00:44:53,956
那就是我能给的, Rose
That's all I got, Rose.

1056
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,896
那已经是我能给你们的全部了
That's all I got to give.

1057
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:05,735
已经没什么可以再给你们了!
Can't give nothing else!

1058
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:33,863
Maxson先生?
Mr. Maxson?

1059
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,001
理事长想见你
Commissioner will see you now.

1060
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,110
Rose!
Rose!

1061
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:51,814
嘿, Ro!
Hey, Ro!

1062
00:45:51,816 --> 00:45:56,119
我真想看到Rand先生当时的糗样
I wish I could've seen Mr. Rand's face when he told you.

1063
00:45:56,121 --> 00:45:59,055
他听了判决后都说不出话来了
He couldn't get it out his mouth. Liked to bit his tongue.

1064
00:45:59,057 --> 00:46:01,057
当他们叫我到理事长的办公室时
When they called me down there to the commissioner's office,

1065
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:03,960
Rand像所有人一样都以为他们要炒了我
he thought they was gonna fire me, like everybody else.

1066
00:46:03,962 --> 00:46:05,795
我可没有这样想
Oh, I didn't think they was gonna fire you.

1067
00:46:05,797 --> 00:46:08,131
我以为他们要给你警告信
I thought they's gonna put you on the warning paper.

1068
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:11,534
嘿, Rose! 对, Rand先生这下一定无话可说了
Hey, Rose! Yeah, Mr. Rand liked to bit his tongue.

1069
00:46:11,536 --> 00:46:13,836
我看到你跑到Taylor的酒吧
I see you run right down there to Taylors'

1070
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:15,104
告诉那个叫Alberta的女子
and told that Alberta gal.

1071
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:18,174
嘿, Rose! 我跟所有人都会说的, 嘿, Ro!
Hey, Rose! I told everybody. Hey, Ro!

1072
00:46:18,176 --> 00:46:20,209
我去那兑现支票 [花钱]
I went down there to cash my check.

1073
00:46:21,077 --> 00:46:21,078
嘿!
Hey!

1074
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:24,080
别叫了, 我知道你回来了
Hush all that hollering. I know you out here.

1075
00:46:24,082 --> 00:46:25,982
理事长怎说了?
What they say down at the commissioner's office?

1076
00:46:25,984 --> 00:46:27,917
我叫你的时候你就该立刻回应我, 女人
You supposed to come when I call you, woman.

1077
00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:29,085
Bono也懂
Bono will tell you that.

1078
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:30,820
你叫Lucille时她不也立刻回应吗?
Don't Lucille come when you call her?

1079
00:46:30,822 --> 00:46:32,359
闭嘴吧老兄, 我又不是狗
Man, hush your mouth. I ain't no dog.

1080
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:33,126
说什么立刻回应你
Talk about come when you call me.

1081
00:46:33,156 --> 00:46:34,991
Bono, 看到了吗? 我以前有只狗
You hear this, Bono? I used to have me an old dog

1082
00:46:35,063 --> 00:46:36,163
也像这样自以为高人一等
get uppity like that.

1083
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:38,861
你喊他来, 他也不理会
You say, "come here, Blue,"he just lay there, look at you.

1084
00:46:38,863 --> 00:46:41,063
最后通常都是被追着打, 为了教训他
End up getting a stick chasin' him away, trying to make him come.

1085
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:42,565
我不在意你和你的狗
I ain't studying you and your dog.

1086
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:44,300
我记得你总会唱起歌来
I remember you used to sing that old song.

1087
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:50,406
没有人想听啊
Nobody wants to hear that old song.

1088
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:55,077
他唱起来时, 总让Cory到处跑
Used to have Cory runnin' around here singin' that song.

1089
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:56,879
我也记得那首歌
Hell, I remember that song myself.

1090
00:47:01,886 --> 00:47:03,073
那是我爸爸的歌
That's my daddy's song.

1091
00:47:03,503 --> 00:47:04,891
他创作的
My daddy made up that song.

1092
00:47:05,121 --> 00:47:07,056
我才不在乎谁作的, 没有人想听你唱的
I don't care who made it up. Don't nobody want to hear you sing it.

1093
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:12,328
你这么兴奋回来, 我就猜到他们没有炒了你
You come in here carrying on, I reckon they ain't fired you.

1094
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,330
理事长到底说了什么?
What they say down there at
the commissioner's office?

1095
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:17,600
Rose, 听着, Rand先生在理事长会见我后
Look here, Rose. Mr. Rand called me in his office

1096
00:47:17,602 --> 00:47:20,169
叫我到他的办公室
after I got back from talkin' to them people down there.

1097
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,839
他叫我进去并说
He called me in his office and told me...

1098
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:25,875
他们要让我当司机!
They was making me a driver!

1099
00:47:25,877 --> 00:47:29,212
- Troy, 你在说笑吧!   - 不信问Bono
- Troy, you kidding!   - No, I ain't. Ask Bono.

1100
00:47:29,214 --> 00:47:30,346
那真好, Troy
That's great, Troy.

1101
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:32,048
那你再不用跟那些人纠缠了
Now you don't have to hassle them people no more.

1102
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:35,151
天啊, 没想到今天你会来
Oh, hell. I didn't think I was gonna see you today.

1103
00:47:35,223 --> 00:47:36,323
我以为你在监狱里
I thought you was in jail.

1104
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:39,188
听到消息说他们扫荡Seefus的店
Got it all over the courier about them raiding Seefus' place

1105
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,924
那个你跟那些不伦不类的家伙经常去的地方
where you be hanging out with all them thugs.

1106
00:47:41,926 --> 00:47:43,593
嘿, 爸, 那跟我没关系
Hey, pop, that ain't got nothing to do with me.

1107
00:47:43,665 --> 00:47:44,765
我没在那赌博
I don't go down there gambling.

1108
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:46,929
我只是去那跟乐队交流
I just go down there to sit in with the band.

1109
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:49,065
那赌博跟我沾不上关系
I ain't got nothing to do with the gambling part.

1110
00:47:49,067 --> 00:47:50,600
他们那里有些很好的音乐人
They got some good music down there.

1111
00:47:50,602 --> 00:47:52,335
那里只有流氓而已
They got some rogues is what they got.

1112
00:47:52,337 --> 00:47:54,370
Bono先生你还好吗? 你好, Rose
How you been, Mr. Bono? Hi, Rose.

1113
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:57,240
我知道你今晚在Crawford Grill有演出 [爵士乐俱乐部]
I see where you playing down at the Crawford Grill tonight.

1114
00:47:57,242 --> 00:47:58,941
你怎么又不带Bonnie来?
How come you ain't brought Bonnie like I told you?

1115
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:00,042
你该带上她来
You shoulda brought Bonnie.

1116
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,277
她很久没来过了
She ain't been by in a month of Sundays.

1117
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,612
我刚巧路过而已
I was just in the neighborhood.

1118
00:48:02,614 --> 00:48:04,146
- 想着见你们一面   - 又来了
- Thought I'd stop by.   - Here it comes.

1119
00:48:04,148 --> 00:48:06,349
你爸爸升职了
Your daddy got a promotion on the rubbish.

1120
00:48:06,351 --> 00:48:08,951
他是第一个驾驶垃圾车的有色人种
He gonna be the first colored driver.

1121
00:48:08,953 --> 00:48:10,186
什么也不用做
Ain't got to do nothin' but sit up there

1122
00:48:10,188 --> 00:48:11,888
像白人一样坐着看报纸就行了
and read the paper, like them white fellas.

1123
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:14,390
爸, 如果你识字的话, 那会是件好事
Hey, pop, if you knew how to read, you'd be all right.

1124
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:17,126
不不, 你指如果这老兄懂得驾驶的话
Nah, nah. You mean if the nigger knew how to drive,

1125
00:48:17,128 --> 00:48:18,264
那才是件好事
he'd be all right.

1126
00:48:18,294 --> 00:48:20,796
一直跟那些人争论驾车的问题
Been fighting with them people about driving

1127
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:22,031
然而连驾照也没有
and ain't even got a license.

1128
00:48:22,033 --> 00:48:23,666
Rand先生知道你没有驾照的吧?
Mr. Rand know you ain't got no driver's license?

1129
00:48:23,738 --> 00:48:24,838
驾车很容易
Driving ain't nothing.

1130
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:26,636
就是扭軚盘而已
All you do is point the truck where you want it to go.

1131
00:48:26,708 --> 00:48:27,908
并不难
Driving ain't nothing.

1132
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:29,872
他们知道你没有驾照吗?
Do they know you ain't got no driver's license?

1133
00:48:29,874 --> 00:48:31,178
那才是我问的
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1134
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,212
我不是问你驾驶是否容易
I ain't asked if driving was easy.

1135
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:34,377
我问你Rand先生是否知道你没有驾照一事
I asked if Mr. Rand know you ain't got no driver's license.

1136
00:48:34,449 --> 00:48:35,649
那人没必要知道我的事
The man ain't got to know my business.

1137
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,980
待他发现时我已经有两三个驾照了
Time he find out, I have two or three of them driver's license.

1138
00:48:37,982 --> 00:48:39,982
- 听着, 爸   - 我就知道你会这么说
- Say, look here, pop.   - I knew it was coming.

1139
00:48:39,984 --> 00:48:41,984
我知道你要说什么
I knew what kinda "look here, pop" that was.

1140
00:48:41,986 --> 00:48:43,352
那小子又要问我拿钱了
Nigger finna ask me for some money.

1141
00:48:43,354 --> 00:48:45,221
今天是星期五, 又是我的发薪日
It's Friday night, it's my payday.

1142
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:48,991
那些没被拘捕的流氓会在Avenue大道流连
All them rogues down on the Avenue, the ones that ain't in jail,

1143
00:48:48,993 --> 00:48:51,661
Lyons赶着去跟他们会合
and Lyons is hopping in his shoes to get down there with them.

1144
00:48:51,733 --> 00:48:52,733
听着, 爸
Now, see, pop,

1145
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:55,298
如果你让别人说完他要说的
if you gave somebody else a chance to talk sometime,

1146
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:59,101
你就会知道我要还你答应过的十块
you'd see I was fixing to pay you back your $10 like I told you.

1147
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:02,238
拿着, 我说过待Bonnie发薪了我会还你的
Here. I told you I'd pay you when Bonnie got paid.

1148
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,440
不, 你自己留着那十块, 存到银行里
No, you keep that $10. Put it in the bank.

1149
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:06,242
下次你觉得又要来这里向我拿钱时
Next time you feel like you wanna come by here

1150
00:49:06,244 --> 00:49:08,077
你就从银行拿出这十块
and ask me for somethin', you go down there and get that.

1151
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:10,011
拿着属于你的十块吧, 爸
Here you go your $10, pop.

1152
00:49:10,112 --> 00:49:11,347
我说过我不想你给我
I told you, I don't want you to give me nothing.

1153
00:49:11,419 --> 00:49:12,519
我只想借而已
I just wanted to borrow $10.

1154
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:15,418
不, 你留着下次用
No, you keep that for the next time you want to ask me.

1155
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,053
别这样, 爸, 拿着吧
Come on, pop, here go your $10.

1156
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:20,189
Troy, 你为何不让那孩子还钱?
Troy, why don't you let the boy pay you back?

1157
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:25,428
你替他拿吧, Rose, 如果你不拿
Here you go, Rose. If you don't take it,

1158
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:27,430
接下来六个月他又要不断唠叨此事了
I'm gonna hear about it for the next six months.

1159
00:49:27,432 --> 00:49:29,265
你也可以顺道给出你的那份薪金, Troy
You can hand yours over, too, Troy.

1160
00:49:29,267 --> 00:49:31,033
Bono, 你看到他们怎对待我了吗
You see this, Bono? You see how they do me?

1161
00:49:31,035 --> 00:49:32,735
看到, Lucille也是这样做
Yeah, Lucille do me the same way.

1162
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:44,046
嘿, 是Troy的儿子啊
Hey. Hey, there's Troy's boy!

1163
00:49:44,048 --> 00:49:45,348
Gabe叔叔, 你最近好吗?
How you doing, Uncle Gabe?

1164
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:47,116
Lyons!
Lyons!

1165
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:51,287
万兽之王
The king of the jungle!

1166
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:54,457
嘿, Rose, 我有朵玫瑰花给你
Rose. Hey, Rose, I got a flower for you.

1167
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:57,159
我亲自摘的, 就跟你名字一样的玫瑰
I picked it myself. That's the same rose like you is.

1168
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,761
你真有心, Gabe
Aw, that's right nice of you, Gabe.

1169
00:49:58,763 --> 00:50:00,363
Gabe叔叔, 你最近在做什么?
What you been doing, Uncle Gabe?

1170
00:50:00,365 --> 00:50:04,100
噢, 我一直在追赶地狱之犬
Oh, I been chasing hellhounds and waiting for the time

1171
00:50:04,102 --> 00:50:06,068
并等着告诉圣彼得打开天堂的门
to tell Saint Peter to open the gates.

1172
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:07,503
你在追赶地狱之犬?
You been chasing hellhounds, huh?

1173
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:09,405
你做得很正确
Well, you doing the right thing, Uncle Gabe.

1174
00:50:09,407 --> 00:50:12,475
- 总有人要去赶走他们   - 是的, 我也知道
- Somebody's got to chase 'em.   - Oh, yeah, I know it.

1175
00:50:12,477 --> 00:50:15,444
魔鬼很强大, 不是那么容易打败
The devil's strong. The devil ain't no pushover.

1176
00:50:15,446 --> 00:50:18,080
地狱之犬一直在寻找人类的气息 [应为sniff, 非snip]
Hellhounds snipping at everybody's heels.

1177
00:50:18,082 --> 00:50:20,750
但我已经准备好喇叭, 等待审判日的来临
But I got my trumpet waiting on the judgment time.

1178
00:50:20,752 --> 00:50:22,451
为了哈米吉多顿之战作准备吗? [圣经中世界末日最后一战]
Waiting on the Battle of Armageddon, huh?

1179
00:50:22,453 --> 00:50:24,520
噢, 那眨眼就会结束
Oh, ain't gonna be too much of a battle

1180
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:28,257
当上帝挥动审判之剑时
when god get to waving that judgment sword.

1181
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:30,359
如果天堂的门关上的话, 那时候人们就得费时
But the people's gonna have a hell of a time

1182
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:33,129
等待进入天堂了
trying to get into heaven if them gates ain't open.

1183
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:34,497
你听到这吗, 爸?
You hear this, pop?

1184
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,298
Gabe叔叔, 你人真好
Uncle Gabe, you all right.

1185
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,366
Lyons.
Lyons.

1186
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,570
万兽之王
The king of the jungle!

1187
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:43,009
Gabe, 你留下来吃晚餐吗?
You stayin' for supper, Gabe?

1188
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:44,077
你要我煮你的份吗?
You want me to fix you a plate?

1189
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:47,209
我要份三明治就好了, 不用煮我的份
I'll just take a sandwich, Rose. I don't want no plate.

1190
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:49,311
我喜欢用双手拿着来吃, 三明治好了
I want to eat with my hands. I'll take a sandwich.

1191
00:50:49,313 --> 00:50:51,781
你呢Lyons? 留下吗? 在煮牛小排呢
What about you, Lyons? You stayin'? Got some short ribs cooking.

1192
00:50:51,783 --> 00:50:55,351
不了, 我通常在演出完结后才用餐的
Nah. I won't eat nothing till after we finish playing.

1193
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:58,120
你应该来看看我演出, 爸
You ought to come down, listen to me play, pop.

1194
00:50:58,122 --> 00:51:00,356
噢, 我不喜欢那些像中国音乐一样的嘈音
Oh, I don't like all that Chinese music, all that noise.

1195
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:03,826
去洗手吧, Gabe, 我现在弄三明治
Go in there and wash up, Gabe. I'll fix you a sandwich.

1196
00:51:03,828 --> 00:51:06,529
Troy在生我的气
Troy mad at me.

1197
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:08,130
你为何生他的气?
What you mad at Uncle Gabe for?

1198
00:51:08,132 --> 00:51:09,265
他以为Troy为了
He think Troy mad at him

1199
00:51:09,267 --> 00:51:11,133
他搬到Pearl那里而生气
'cause he moved over there to Miss Pearl's.

1200
00:51:11,135 --> 00:51:13,235
我才没有生气, 他可以住他想住的地方
I ain't mad at the man. He can live where he want to live at.

1201
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:15,404
他为何搬到那里? Pearl小姐任何人都不喜欢
Well, what he move over there for? Miss Pearl don't like nobody.

1202
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:17,273
噢, 她不介意他在, 还对他颇好
Oh, she don't mind him none. She treat him real nice.

1203
00:51:17,345 --> 00:51:18,445
她就不允许他唱歌而已
She just don't allow all that singing.

1204
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:21,377
她不介意他在为她付租金, 仅此而已
She don't mind that rent he be paying. That's what she don't mind.

1205
00:51:21,379 --> 00:51:23,145
Troy, 我不想再跟你讨论此事
Troy, I ain't goin' through that with you no more.

1206
00:51:23,147 --> 00:51:24,847
他搬到那因为他想要有自己的地方
He moved over there 'cause he wanted his own place.

1207
00:51:24,919 --> 00:51:26,019
他可以随他所想的做
He can come and go as he please.

1208
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:28,284
他可以在这里做他想做的, 我也不介意
He can come and go as he please here. I wasn't stoppin' him.

1209
00:51:28,286 --> 00:51:29,485
我也没规定他什么
I wasn't putting no rules on the man.

1210
00:51:29,487 --> 00:51:31,324
你明知道那是两码子的事
That ain't the same thing, and you know it.

1211
00:51:31,754 --> 00:51:33,292
我不想再讨论这话题
Now that's the last I wanna hear about that.

1212
00:51:33,322 --> 00:51:35,157
我不想再听到Gabe和Miss Pearl之间的事
I don't wanna hear nothin' else about Gabe and Miss Pearl.

1213
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:36,195
还有下周...
And next week...

1214
00:51:36,197 --> 00:51:38,025
我准备好了, Rose
I'm ready for my sandwich, Rose.

1215
00:51:38,027 --> 00:51:40,129
还有下周, 当从学校来的负责人到来
And next week, when that recruiter come from that school,

1216
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:42,598
我要你签署让Cory进美式足球队
I want you to sign that paper and go on and let Cory play football.

1217
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,500
我不想再听你说起此事
That'll be the last I have to hear about that.

1218
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:51,307
Cory被录取了? 他要到哪所学校?
Cory got recruited? What school he goin' to?

1219
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:52,875
我不想再理会Cory的事
I ain't thinking about Cory nothing.

1220
00:51:52,877 --> 00:51:55,277
那小子把这里当成他的地方
Boy walking around here smelling his piss,

1221
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:56,612
以为可以为所欲为
thinking he gonna do what he want to do,

1222
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:59,181
不听我的说话
irregardless of what I say.

1223
00:51:59,183 --> 00:52:01,417
Bono, 听着, 我离开理事长的办公室后
Look here, Bono, I left the commissioner's office

1224
00:52:01,419 --> 00:52:02,885
去了A&P那里
and went down to the A&P.

1225
00:52:02,887 --> 00:52:05,321
那小子根本没在那工作, 他跟我说谎了
That boy ain't workin' down there, he lied to me.

1226
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:08,591
说他取回了工作, 周末得上班什么的
Tellin' me he got his job back, tellin' me he workin' weekend,

1227
00:52:08,593 --> 00:52:10,326
说他课后在上班
tellin' me he workin' after school.

1228
00:52:10,328 --> 00:52:12,528
Stawicki说他根本没来上班
Mr. Stawicki says he ain't working down there at all.

1229
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,700
Cory只是长大了而已
Cory just growing up.

1230
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:16,198
他有了自己的想法, 不能再听你说的
He just bustin' at the seams, tryin' to fill out your shoes.

1231
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:17,370
我才不在意他想什么
I don't care what he doing.

1232
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,468
当他到了反叛期
When he get to the place where he want to disobey me,

1233
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,605
那就是出外打拼的时候了, Bono也懂
then it's time for him to move on. Bono will tell you that.

1234
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:24,440
我肯定他不能违抗他父亲后
I bet he ain't never disobeyed his daddy

1235
00:52:24,442 --> 00:52:26,475
不用受罚
without paying the consequences.

1236
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,644
我根本没机会违抗他
I ain't never had the chance.

1237
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:32,481
我父亲到处走, 我根本没看过他
My daddy came on through, but I ain't never knew him to see him.

1238
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:35,284
或者他在想什么, 去哪了
Or what he had on his mind, or where he went.

1239
00:52:35,286 --> 00:52:39,155
就四海为家, 寻找新大陆
Just moving on through. Searching out the new land.

1240
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:42,258
那就是以前的人用的
That's what the old folks used to call it.

1241
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:45,594
一个人要是到处搬, 不停换女人
See a fella moving around from place to place, woman to woman,

1242
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:48,264
他们叫这"寻找新大陆"
they call it "searching out the new land."

1243
00:52:48,266 --> 00:52:49,732
我也不清楚他有没有找到
I can't say if he ever found it.

1244
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,269
我来到这地方, 也不想有孩子
I come along, didn't want no kids.

1245
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,538
我也不知道我能否安定下来
I didn't know if I was gonna be in one place long enough

1246
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,606
当个爸爸
to fix on 'em right as their daddy.

1247
00:52:57,608 --> 00:52:59,909
我想不如还是寻找新大陆算了
I figured I was going searching, too.

1248
00:52:59,911 --> 00:53:02,278
没想过我跟Lucille在一起的时间
As it turn out, I been hooked up with Lucille

1249
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,613
也几乎有你爸爸和Rose在一起那么久了
for near about as long as your daddy been with Rose.

1250
00:53:04,615 --> 00:53:06,916
已经16年了
Going on 16 years.

1251
00:53:06,918 --> 00:53:08,684
有时候我真希望自己不认识我的父亲
Sometimes, I wish I'd never known my daddy.

1252
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:12,655
他不在意孩子过得怎样, 对他来说毫不重要
He ain't cared nothing about no kids. A kid to him wasn't nothing.

1253
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:16,358
他只想你快点成人
All he wanted you to do was learn how to walk,

1254
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:17,530
好让你能去工作赚钱给他
so he could start you to working.

1255
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:21,730
吃饭时, 他总先吃, 你只吃他剩下的
Come to eating, he ate first. Anything left over, that's what you got.

1256
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:25,201
他会吃掉所有东西, 而你只分到那么一点
Man would sit down, eat two chickens, and give you the wing.

1257
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:28,404
爸, 别胡说了, 天下父母都会让子女吃饱
You ought to stop that, pop. Everybody feed their kids.

1258
00:53:28,406 --> 00:53:31,540
不管时势有多艰难, 天下父母都疼爱子女
No matter how hard times is, everybody care about their kids.

1259
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:32,741
确保他们三餐温饱
Make sure they have something to eat.

1260
00:53:32,743 --> 00:53:34,643
我父亲唯一在意的
Only thing my daddy cared about

1261
00:53:34,645 --> 00:53:36,512
就是叫我们搬那一卷卷的棉花给Lubin先生
was getting them bales of cotton in to Mr. Lubin.

1262
00:53:36,514 --> 00:53:38,614
那是他唯一在意的事
That's the only thing that mattered to him.

1263
00:53:38,616 --> 00:53:40,950
以前我都在想他为何还活着
Sometimes, I used to wonder why he was still living,

1264
00:53:40,952 --> 00:53:43,652
为何魔鬼还没带走他
why the devil hadn't come and got him.

1265
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:45,654
快把棉花搬到Lubin先生那
"Get them bales of cotton in to Mr. Lubin."

1266
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:47,289
后来才知道我父亲欠Lubin钱
Find out he owe him money.

1267
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:48,424
当他知道此地不宜久留时
He should have just went on and left

1268
00:53:48,426 --> 00:53:49,458
他就该跑路
when he saw he couldn't get nowhere.

1269
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:50,630
至少我会那样做
That's what I would've done.

1270
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:53,562
他怎留下11个孩子就走? 还有走去哪?
How he gonna leave with 11 kids? And where he gonna go?

1271
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,699
他只懂耕作, 他根本无路可逃
He ain't knew nothing but how to farm. No, he was trapped.

1272
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,436
我想他也知道, 但我也会为他说一句...
I think he knew it, too. But I'll say this for him...

1273
00:54:00,438 --> 00:54:02,338
他觉得他有责任照顾我们
He felt a responsibility toward us.

1274
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,406
虽然不像我预期一样体贴
May not have treated us like I felt he should have,

1275
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:06,375
但他要是没有良心
but without that responsibility,

1276
00:54:06,377 --> 00:54:08,410
大可以留下我们, 自己跑路
he could have run off and left us,

1277
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:09,678
再另起炉灶
made his own way.

1278
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,313
很多人也这样
A lot of them did.

1279
00:54:11,315 --> 00:54:12,748
你说你父亲的那一代吗?
Back in those days, what you talkin' about?

1280
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,583
他们每天离开房子
They walk out their front door

1281
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:17,786
无论多日晒雨淋, 都在街上一直走
and take off down one road or
another and just keep on walkin'.

1282
00:54:17,788 --> 00:54:19,788
对, 这才像话
There you go. That's what I'm talkin' about.

1283
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:23,425
一直走到他们遇到下一间房子
Just keep on walking till they come to something else.

1284
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:26,695
你没听过大迁徙吗? [一战时黑人从美国南部迁北]
Ain't you never heard of nobody having the walking blues?

1285
00:54:26,697 --> 00:54:29,465
那就是你叫那些跑路的人
Now, that's what you call it when you just take off like that.

1286
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:33,369
我父亲不是你说的那种
My daddy ain't had no walking blues. What you talking about?

1287
00:54:33,371 --> 00:54:34,737
他留下来了
He stayed right there with his family,

1288
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:39,608
但他坏事做尽
but he was just as evil as he could be!

1289
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:43,445
我妈妈接受不了他和他的性格
My mama couldn't stand him. Couldn't stand that evilness.

1290
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:46,482
我8岁时她就离开了
She run off when I was about eight.

1291
00:54:46,484 --> 00:54:49,618
她有一晚静悄悄的走, 跟我说她会回来
She sneaked off one night, told me she was coming back for me.

1292
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,487
自那我就再没有见过她
I ain't never seen her no more.

1293
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:55,658
他有过的女人终究都会离开他, 他不是个好人
All his women run off and left him. He wasn't good for nobody.

1294
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,760
轮到我离家的时候
My turn come to head out.

1295
00:54:57,762 --> 00:54:59,361
我当时14岁
I was 14,

1296
00:54:59,363 --> 00:55:02,364
跟Joe Canewell的女儿打得火热
got to sniffing around Joe Canewell's daughter.

1297
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:05,801
我们家有只老骡子叫Greyboy
We had this old mule called "Greyboy".

1298
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:08,337
我父亲叫我出去耕作
My daddy sent me out to do some plowing.

1299
00:55:08,339 --> 00:55:11,807
让我有机会跟Joe Canewell的女儿谈谈情
I got to fooling around with Joe Canewell's daughter.

1300
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:15,377
我们找到了一个隐蔽的地方抚摸大家
Found us a nice spot, got real cozy with each other.

1301
00:55:15,379 --> 00:55:18,547
她当时13岁, 所以我们都知道大家发育了
She was about 13, so we done figured we grown anyway.

1302
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:20,816
我们在溪河附近, 互相抚摸
So, we were down there by the creek, enjoying ourselves,

1303
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:22,518
把正事都放一边
ain't thinking about nothing.

1304
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,787
怎料绑着Greyboy的绳子松开了
Didn't know Greyboy had gotten loose,

1305
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:28,457
它跑回家里, 我父亲就知道事有蹊跷
wandered back to the house, and my daddy was lookin' for me.

1306
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:32,328
他找到我们时, 看到我们还在抚摸大家
So, we down there enjoying ourselves when he come up on us.

1307
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:34,430
我们不知所措
Surprised us.

1308
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:36,832
他拿着骡子身上的皮带
Had them leather straps off that mule,

1309
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:40,069
开始不停地打我
commenced to whupping me like there was no tomorrow.

1310
00:55:40,071 --> 00:55:42,738
我站起来, 当时心感侮辱又愤怒
I jump up. I'm mad, embarrassed.

1311
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:45,674
又很害怕他
I was scared of my daddy.

1312
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,710
他开始打我时
Now, when he commenced to whipping on me,

1313
00:55:47,712 --> 00:55:49,578
很自然地我就逃跑吧
quite naturally, I run to get out of the way.

1314
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:52,414
我想他是因为我没有完成工作而生气
Now, I think he's mad 'cause I ain't done my work.

1315
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:54,850
但我看到他故意让我落跑
But I see where he's chasing me off,

1316
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:56,885
然后想去独占这个女孩
so he can have the gal for himself.

1317
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:00,622
当我想透了
When I see what the matter of it was,

1318
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:05,694
我变得不再害怕他, 自那, 我成为了一个男人
I lost all fear of my daddy, and right there, I became a man.

1319
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:08,364
才14岁
Fourteen years of age.

1320
00:56:08,366 --> 00:56:11,367
是时候轮到我作主了
Now, it's my turn to run him off.

1321
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:13,102
我拿起他刚才用的皮带
I picked up them same reins he used on me.

1322
00:56:13,104 --> 00:56:16,739
然后开始打起他来
I picked up them reins, I commenced to whupping on him.

1323
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,975
那女孩落荒而逃
Gal jump up, she run off.

1324
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:23,412
当他转过来看着我时
When he turned to face me,

1325
00:56:23,414 --> 00:56:25,381
我终于知道为何魔鬼没有带走他
I knew why the devil never come and get him

1326
00:56:25,383 --> 00:56:27,549
因为他就是魔鬼
'cause he was the devil himself.

1327
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:31,453
我忘了之后发生什么了
I don't know what happened.

1328
00:56:31,455 --> 00:56:34,656
我醒过来, 躺在溪河旁
I woke up, laying there by the creek,

1329
00:56:34,658 --> 00:56:38,494
我们养的老狗Blue, 他在舔我的脸
and Blue, this old dog we had, he was licking my face.

1330
00:56:38,496 --> 00:56:41,597
我的双眼肿极了
Both my eyes were swoll shut.

1331
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,532
我以为我瞎了, 什么都看不到
I thought I was blind, I couldn't see nothing.

1332
00:56:43,534 --> 00:56:47,403
就躺在那里哭
I just laid there and cried.

1333
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:55,711
我也不知道该怎办
And I didn't know what I was gonna do.

1334
00:56:55,713 --> 00:57:00,416
但我知道是时候离家出走了
But I knew the time had come for me to leave my daddy's house.

1335
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:03,819
突然间我感觉到世界之大
Suddenly, the world got big, and...

1336
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:10,826
费了我很多时间才弄清楚
It was a long time before I could cut it down to where I could handle it.

1337
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:15,497
弄清楚的期间, 我发现
Part of that cutting down was where I got to the place

1338
00:57:15,499 --> 00:57:17,533
其实他在我心底下, 在怒吼着想出来
where I could feel him kicking in my blood,

1339
00:57:17,535 --> 00:57:18,934
而我和他之所以不同
and I knew the only thing that separated us

1340
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:21,470
只是我们不是生于同一个时代而已
was a matter of a few years.

1341
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,707
Gabe叔叔, 你在吃什么?
What you got there, Uncle Gabe?

1342
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:28,177
我在吃火腿三明治
I got me a ham sandwich.

1343
00:57:28,179 --> 00:57:30,546
Rose给我弄了火腿三明治
Rose gave me a ham sandwich.

1344
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,950
除了Gabriel外, 我没再联系家里的人
I lost touch with everybody except Gabriel.

1345
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:40,956
但...
But...

1346
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:46,628
我希望他已经死了
I hope he's dead.

1347
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:53,569
我希望他能找到点安慰
I hope he found some peace.

1348
00:57:53,571 --> 00:57:55,737
真是个沉重的故事, 爸
That's a heavy story, pop.

1349
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:00,809
我都不知道你14岁就离家了
I didn't know you left home when you was 14.

1350
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,878
14岁太早独立了
Fourteen's kinda young to be on your own.

1351
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,880
要是我的话真不知道该怎办
I don't know what I would've done.

1352
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:08,550
我在那溪河站了起来, 向莫比尔出发
Well, I got up from that creek, walked on down to Mobile.

1353
00:58:08,552 --> 00:58:12,221
我不想再耕作了, 我想我在城市会找到更好的工作
I was through with farming.
I figured I'd do better in the cities.

1354
00:58:12,223 --> 00:58:14,022
所以我徒步走了200英里到莫比尔
So, I walked the 200 miles to Mobile.

1355
00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:16,692
等下, 你才没有徒步走200英里, 爸
Wait a minute, you ain't walked no 200 miles, pop.

1356
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:19,895
没有人想这样做
Ain't nobody gonna walk no 200 miles.

1357
00:58:19,897 --> 00:58:21,930
那是段很长的距离啊!
You talking about some walking there!

1358
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:24,800
以前唯一到其他地方的方法就是徒步
That's the only way you got anywhere back in them days.

1359
00:58:24,802 --> 00:58:27,769
妈的, 我会选择搭便车
Shit! Damn if I wouldn't have hitched a ride with somebody.

1360
00:58:27,771 --> 00:58:29,571
哪来的便车?
Who you gonna hitch it with?

1361
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:31,540
那时候才没有现在的车和科技
There ain't no cars and things like they got now.

1362
00:58:31,542 --> 00:58:32,975
当时是1918年
We talking about 1918.

1363
00:58:32,977 --> 00:58:34,776
你们在这里聊什么?
What you all out here gettin' into?

1364
00:58:34,778 --> 00:58:36,945
我跟Lyons说他现时的生活比以前好多了
I'm telling Lyons how good he got it.

1365
00:58:36,947 --> 00:58:38,547
他根本不知道我在说什么
He don't know nothing about this I'm talking.

1366
00:58:38,549 --> 00:58:39,848
Lyons, 刚才Bonnie打来了
Lyons, that was Bonnie on the phone.

1367
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,250
她说你约好了去接她下班
She says you supposed to pick her up.

1368
00:58:41,252 --> 00:58:42,985
知道了, Rose
Yeah, okay, Rose.

1369
00:58:42,987 --> 00:58:45,821
我到了莫比尔
I walked on down to Mobile,

1370
00:58:45,823 --> 00:58:49,258
搭了驶向这边来的人便车
hitched up with some fellows that was coming up this way.

1371
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,893
到了才发现
Got up here and found out,

1372
00:58:50,895 --> 00:58:52,661
不但找不到工作
not only could you not get a job,

1373
00:58:52,663 --> 00:58:54,062
也找不到住处
you couldn't find no place to live.

1374
00:58:54,064 --> 00:58:56,999
我以为自己自由了
I thought I was in freedom.

1375
00:58:57,001 --> 00:58:59,668
有色人种都住在里弗班克 [加州城市]
Colored folks living down there on the Riverbanks

1376
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,870
随便哪里都好
in whatever kind of shelter they could find for themselves.

1377
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:04,606
有些在桥下睡
Right down there under the Brady Street Bridge.

1378
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:08,076
有些在自己用木条和沥青纸搭建的帐篷睡
Living down there in shacks made out of sticks and tar paper.

1379
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:10,913
那时候我都要崩溃了
Messed around down there.

1380
00:59:10,915 --> 00:59:13,649
无恶不作, 开始偷窃
Went from bad to worse. Started stealing.

1381
00:59:13,651 --> 00:59:16,051
开始时是食物, 然后我想到偷钱
First, it was food. Then I figure I steal me some money,

1382
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:18,820
可以买食物, 鞋等
I can buy me some food, buy me some shoes, too.

1383
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:20,889
一样接一样, 最后遇见你的妈妈
One thing led to another. Met your mama.

1384
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:23,692
当时还小, 急着想成为个男人
I was young, anxious to be a man.

1385
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:26,662
我遇到你妈妈后有了你, 怎办了?
I met your mama and had you. Why'd I do that for?

1386
00:59:26,664 --> 00:59:28,964
我得多养两人
Now, I got to worry about feeding you and her.

1387
00:59:28,966 --> 00:59:30,732
得要偷更多才行
Got to steal three times as much.

1388
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,870
我有一天在外面, 想着对谁下手
I went out one day looking for somebody to rob.

1389
00:59:34,872 --> 00:59:36,138
对, 我当时是个小偷
That's what I was, I was a robber.

1390
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:38,674
我不会隐瞒
I'mma tell you the truth.

1391
00:59:38,676 --> 00:59:40,709
直至今天我还是心感惭愧, 但那是事实
I'm ashamed of it today, but it's the truth.

1392
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:43,645
我找到目标, 掏出了我的小刀
I went to rob this fella, I pull out my knife.

1393
00:59:43,647 --> 00:59:45,781
他拿出了枪, 想也不想就射在我胸口上
He pulled out a gun, shot me in the chest.

1394
00:59:45,783 --> 00:59:46,949
那感觉
It felt like somebody had taken

1395
00:59:46,951 --> 00:59:48,984
就像有人拿着灼热的铁块烙印在我身上
a hot branding iron and laid it on me.

1396
00:59:48,986 --> 00:59:52,054
他射了我之后, 我跳上前以小刀还击
Now, when he shot me, I jumped at him with my knife,

1397
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:55,924
他们说我杀了他
and they say I killed him.

1398
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:57,993
让我坐了15年监牢
Locked me up, put me in the penitentiary for 15 years.

1399
00:59:57,995 --> 00:59:59,661
我在里面认识了Bono
That's where I met Bono.

1400
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:02,331
学会了打棒球
Where I learned how to play baseball.

1401
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:03,932
出来后才发现你妈妈带走了你
Got out that place, and your mama had taken you,

1402
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:05,968
在一个没有我的环境下继续生活
went on to make a life without me.

1403
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:08,070
15年是段很长的时间
Fifteen years was a long time for her to wait.

1404
01:00:08,072 --> 01:00:11,072
但那15年让我改正了
But that 15 years cured me of that robbing stuff.

1405
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:11,707
Rose会告诉你
Rose'll tell you.

1406
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:13,942
我再遇到她时, 她问我
I first met her, she ask me if I had

1407
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:16,078
是否已经将那无知改掉了
gotten all that foolishness out of my system.

1408
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,013
我说: 宝目, 只剩你和棒球
I said, "baby, it's you and baseball,

1409
01:00:18,015 --> 01:00:19,915
对我来说是重要的, 听到吗, Bono?
"all what count to me." You hear me, Bono?

1410
01:00:19,917 --> 01:00:22,718
而我也真的那样想, 她说: 哪样较重要?
And I meant it, too. She said, "which one come first?"

1411
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,821
我说: 当然是棒球
I said, "well, ain't no doubt it's baseball.

1412
01:00:25,823 --> 01:00:27,856
但要是你留下来和我白头到老
"But you stick and get old with me,

1413
01:00:27,858 --> 01:00:29,625
我们的爱会比对棒球的爱更长寿
"and we'll both outlive this baseball."

1414
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:30,760
我说对了吗, Rose?
Am I right, Rose?

1415
01:00:33,828 --> 01:00:34,398
那是真的
And it's true.

1416
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,028
老兄, 闭嘴吧, 你才没有说过
Man, hush your mouth. You ain't say no such thing.

1417
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:38,400
你当时说"宝贝你知道你永远都是最重要的"
Talkin' about, "baby, you know you'll always be number one with me."

1418
01:00:38,402 --> 01:00:41,036
那才是你所说的
That's what you was talking.

1419
01:00:41,038 --> 01:00:43,002
那就是为何我那么爱这个女人
That's why I love this woman.

1420
01:00:43,122 --> 01:00:44,376
Rose总会提醒你
Rose will keep you straight.

1421
01:00:44,406 --> 01:00:45,907
如果你误入歧途, 她总会提醒你
You get off the track, she'll straighten you up.

1422
01:00:45,909 --> 01:00:47,576
Lyons, 你快点去接Bonnie
Lyons, you better get on up and get Bonnie.

1423
01:00:47,778 --> 01:00:48,815
她在等你呢
She waiting on you.

1424
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:49,882
- 嘿, 爸   - 什么?
- Hey, pop.   - Yeah?

1425
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:53,247
你应该来看看我表演
You ought to come down to the grill, hear me play.

1426
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:54,816
老兄, 我才不去
Oh, man, I ain't goin' down there.

1427
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:56,151
我太老了, 不适合到俱乐部
I'm too old to be hanging out in them clubs.

1428
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:59,721
你得很出色才能在[酒吧和]烤肉店演出
You got to be good to play down at the grill.

1429
01:00:59,723 --> 01:01:01,123
来吧, 爸
Come on, pop.

1430
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:02,658
我明天还得早起
I got to get up in the morning.

1431
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:05,027
你不用待到很晚
Well, you ain't gotta stay long.

1432
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:09,798
不了, 我打算吃了晚餐就去睡
No, I'm gonna eat my supper and go to bed.

1433
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,802
那我走了, 下次见
Well, I got to go. I'll see you later.

1434
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:19,675
你别在我的发薪日出现
Don't you come by my house on my payday!

1435
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:21,977
还有下次来先打电话, 让别人知道
And pick up the phone, let somebody know you coming,

1436
01:01:21,979 --> 01:01:24,012
也带上Bonnie, 你知道我很想见她
and bring Bonnie, you know I'm always glad to see her.

1437
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:27,749
好的, Rose, 保重
I'll do that, Rose. You take care now.

1438
01:01:27,751 --> 01:01:29,117
- 下次见, 爸   - 好吧
- See you, pop.    - All right.

1439
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,186
再见, Bono先生
See you, Mr. Bono.

1440
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:32,821
再见, Gabe叔叔
See you, Uncle Gabe!

1441
01:01:32,823 --> 01:01:34,456
Lyons! 万兽之王!
Lyons! King of the jungle!

1442
01:01:36,229 --> 01:01:37,157
晚餐好了吗, 女人?
Supper ready, woman?

1443
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:38,694
我们有点事要做
Me and you got some business to take care of.

1444
01:01:38,696 --> 01:01:40,929
- 我会让你爽翻天   - Troy, 我说过了
- I'mma tear it up, too.   - Troy, I done told you now!

1445
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:42,898
天啊, 女人, 是Bono而已, 他就像家人一样
Oh, hell, woman, it's Bono. Bono like family.

1446
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,100
我已经认识这朋友...
I done know this nigger since...

1447
01:01:45,102 --> 01:01:47,803
- 我认识你多久了?   - 很久了
- How long have I known you?  - It's been a long time.

1448
01:01:47,805 --> 01:01:50,138
我自Skippy还是小朋友的时候就认识这朋友 [应为电影]
I done known this nigger since Skippy was a pup!

1449
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:52,074
经历了不少日子
Me and him done been through some times!

1450
01:01:52,076 --> 01:01:53,909
你说对了
You sure are right about that.

1451
01:01:53,911 --> 01:01:55,977
我认识他甚至比认识你还长, Rose
Hell, I known him longer than I known you, Rose,

1452
01:01:55,979 --> 01:01:57,913
至今我们还是好朋友
and we still standin' shoulder to shoulder.

1453
01:01:57,915 --> 01:02:01,216
夫复何求啊Bono
Look here, Bono, a man can't ask for no more than that.

1454
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:02,784
我爱你, 朋友
I love you, nigger.

1455
01:02:02,786 --> 01:02:04,786
天啊别来这套, 我也爱你
Oh, hell! I love you, too.

1456
01:02:04,788 --> 01:02:07,856
但我得回去, 你在这里能见你的女人
But I got to get home, see my woman. You got yours in hand.

1457
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:09,758
我得回去才能见到她
I got to go get mine.

1458
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:13,432
你为何这样做, 爸?
What you do that for, pop?

1459
01:02:13,434 --> 01:02:15,462
Cory, 什么事了?
What's the matter? Cory, what's the matter?

1460
01:02:15,464 --> 01:02:16,832
爸到学校跟Zellman教练说
Pop done went up to the school and told Coach Zellman

1461
01:02:16,834 --> 01:02:17,999
我不能继续打美式足球
I can't play football no more.

1462
01:02:18,001 --> 01:02:19,768
也不让我比赛和练习
Wouldn't even let me play the game.

1463
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:21,136
他告诉教练叫球队负责人别来找他
Told him to tell the recruiter not to come.

1464
01:02:21,138 --> 01:02:23,071
- Troy.   - 你叫我做什么?
- Troy.   - What you Troying me for?

1465
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:24,806
对, 我的确做了, 那小子知道原因
Yeah, I did it. And the boy knows why I did it.

1466
01:02:24,808 --> 01:02:26,808
你为何要这样对我? 那是我唯一的机会啊!
Why you wanna do that to me? That was the one chance I had!

1467
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:28,176
让Cory打美式足球又没什么问题, Troy
Ain't nothing wrong with Cory playing football, Troy.

1468
01:02:28,248 --> 01:02:29,148
那小子欺骗了我
The boy lied to me.

1469
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:32,047
我跟那臭小子说过: 你想继续打
I told the nigger, "you want to play football,

1470
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:33,019
就得继续完成家务
"you keep up with your chores

1471
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:36,051
继续在A&P工作, 那就是条件
"hold that job down at the A&P." That was the conditions.

1472
01:02:36,123 --> 01:02:37,223
我去过Stawicki先生那里...
I stopped down to see Mr. Stawicki...

1473
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:40,255
赛季期间我下课后不能去工作, 爸
I can't work after school during the football season, pop.

1474
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:42,791
我跟你说过Stawicki先生会为我留着位置
I tried to tell you Mr. Stawicki was holding my job for me.

1475
01:02:42,793 --> 01:02:44,397
你从不听别人说话
You don't never want to listen to nobody,

1476
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:45,231
然后就替我自作主张?
and then you wanna go and do this to me?

1477
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:47,162
我没对你做什么, 这全都是你自找的
I ain't done nothin' to you. You done it to yourself.

1478
01:02:47,164 --> 01:02:48,830
就因为你以前没有机会!
Just 'cause you didn't get a chance!

1479
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:50,932
你只是害怕我会比你有成就, 仅此而已!
You're just scared I'm gonna be better than you, that's all!

1480
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:57,939
- 来这   - Troy
- Come here.   - Troy.

1481
01:02:58,508 --> 01:02:59,775
Troy.
Troy

1482
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,916
捡起它
Pick it up.

1483
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:18,360
戴上它
Put it on.

1484
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:28,103
系隐
Strap it up.

1485
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,076
好了, 听着
All right. See

1486
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:38,346
你犯了个错误
You done made a mistake.

1487
01:03:38,348 --> 01:03:41,116
- 我什么都没做   - 我来告诉你
- I didn't even do nothing - I'll tell you what your mistake was.

1488
01:03:41,884 --> 01:03:45,320
你挥棒了, 但你没打中球
You swung at the ball and you didn't hit it.

1489
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:49,191
那是第一振, 你现在在打击区
That's strike one. You in the batter's box now.

1490
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:52,327
你挥棒但没打中, 明白了吗?
You swung and you missed, see?

1491
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:54,996
那是第一振
That's strike one.

1492
01:03:57,967 --> 01:04:00,969
你最别被三振
Don't you strike out.

1493
01:05:33,996 --> 01:05:35,163
Cory, 你何不进来
Cory, why don't you come on in here,

1494
01:05:35,165 --> 01:05:36,998
帮我清洁一下杯柜?
help me clean out these cupboards?

1495
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,235
我不会退出球队的, 我不在意爸爸说什么
I ain't quitting the team. I don't care what papa says.

1496
01:05:40,237 --> 01:05:42,404
他回来后我会跟他商讨的
I'll talk to him when he get back.

1497
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,239
他得去看你叔叔Gabe
He had to go see about your Uncle Gabe.

1498
01:05:44,241 --> 01:05:45,674
警察又拘捕了他
Police done arrested him again.

1499
01:05:45,676 --> 01:05:47,342
说他扰乱秩序
Said he was disturbing the peace.

1500
01:05:47,344 --> 01:05:49,010
他很快回来
He'll be back directly.

1501
01:05:49,012 --> 01:05:51,413
进来帮我刷刷杯柜
Come on in here and help me clean out these cupboards.

1502
01:05:51,415 --> 01:05:53,014
来吧
Come on.

1503
01:06:03,192 --> 01:06:05,160
Troy, 他们怎说了
Troy, what they say down there?

1504
01:06:05,162 --> 01:06:08,430
没说什么, 我给了他们$50, 他们就让他走了
They ain't said nothing. I give them $50, they let him go.

1505
01:06:08,432 --> 01:06:10,398
晚点再跟你说
I'll talk to you about it.

1506
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:11,370
Cory在哪?
Where Cory?

1507
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,069
他在里面帮我清洁杯柜
He in the house, helping me clean out these cupboards.

1508
01:06:14,071 --> 01:06:16,071
那去叫他出来这里
All right, tell him to get his butt out here.

1509
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:20,375
他们只想要钱
All they want is the money.

1510
01:06:20,377 --> 01:06:22,711
我去接他回来已经六七次了
This makes six, seven times, I done went down there and got him.

1511
01:06:22,713 --> 01:06:25,080
他们大老远看到我来, 就已经伸出手向我拿钱
See me coming, they stick out their hands.

1512
01:06:25,082 --> 01:06:27,983
我明白, 他们只在意钱
Yeah, I know what you mean.
That's all they care about, that money.

1513
01:06:27,985 --> 01:06:30,118
不在意对错
They don't care about what's right.

1514
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:35,991
傻子, 你为何拿了硬木材回来?
Nigger, why you got to go and get some hardwood?

1515
01:06:35,993 --> 01:06:38,226
你只不过是筑个藩篱而已
You ain't doing nothin' but building a little old fence.

1516
01:06:38,228 --> 01:06:40,261
去找些松木, 那才是你需要的
Get you some soft pinewood. That's all you need.

1517
01:06:40,263 --> 01:06:42,063
我知道自己在做什么, 这才是用在室外的木材
I know what I'm doing. This outside wood.

1518
01:06:42,065 --> 01:06:44,265
松木是用在室内的
You put pinewood inside the house.

1519
01:06:44,267 --> 01:06:47,335
松木是室内用的, 这些是室外的
Pinewood inside wood. This here the outside wood.

1520
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,504
告诉我, 籓篱要建在哪?
Now tell me, where the fence gonna be?

1521
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:52,978
你不需用上这种木材
You don't need this wood.

1522
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:55,008
你可以用松木建
You can put it up with pinewood,

1523
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:56,778
那籓篱会比你更长寿
and it'll stand as long as you gonna be here looking at it.

1524
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:58,313
你怎知道我何时死, 朋友?
How you know how long I'm gonna be here, nigger?

1525
01:06:58,315 --> 01:07:00,148
天啊, 我可能长生不老呢
Hell, I might live forever.

1526
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:02,784
我会比那老头Horsely活得久
I'll live longer than old man Horsely.

1527
01:07:02,786 --> 01:07:04,486
Magee以前也总是这样说
That's what Magee used to say.

1528
01:07:04,488 --> 01:07:07,088
Magee是个大傻子, 你告诉我谁会
Ah, Magee a damn fool. Now you tell me who you ever heard of

1529
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:10,225
用生锈的钳子替自己拔牙?
gonna pull their own teeth with a pair of rusty pliers?

1530
01:07:10,297 --> 01:07:11,197
他们是老一辈的人
They're old folks.

1531
01:07:11,227 --> 01:07:13,328
我祖父以前也用钳子拔牙
My granddaddy used to pull his teeth with pliers.

1532
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:15,463
以前没有牙医会为有色人种服务
They ain't had no dentists for colored folk back then.

1533
01:07:15,465 --> 01:07:18,233
至少用清洁的钳子吧, 懂吗?
Well, get clean pliers. You understand? Clean pliers.

1534
01:07:18,235 --> 01:07:20,635
先消毒, 再者, 今非昔比了
Sterilize them. Besides, we ain't living back then.

1535
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:24,139
他只需要到Goldblum牙医就行了
All he had to do was go down to Doc Goldblum's.

1536
01:07:24,141 --> 01:07:26,574
我看到你和那来自塔拉哈西的女孩, Alberta
I see where you and that Tallahassee gal, that Alberta,

1537
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:29,277
看到你们老在一起
see where you all done got tight.

1538
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:30,449
什么意思?
What you mean, "got tight"?

1539
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:32,781
我看到你经常和她打闹
I see where you be laughing and joking with her all the time.

1540
01:07:32,783 --> 01:07:35,483
我跟每个人也是这样做, 你懂我的, Bono
I laugh and joke with 'em all. Bono, you know me.

1541
01:07:35,485 --> 01:07:37,552
不是平常那种打闹
Ain't the kind of laughing and joking I'm talking about.

1542
01:07:39,322 --> 01:07:40,789
Bono先生, 你好吗?
How you doing, Mr. Bono?

1543
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:42,490
Cory, 拿起Bono手中的木锯开始工作
Cory, get that saw from Bono and cut some wood.

1544
01:07:42,492 --> 01:07:45,160
他说木材太硬很难锯断
He talking about wood too hard to cut.

1545
01:07:45,162 --> 01:07:47,195
退后点, Jim
Go on. Stand back there, Jim.

1546
01:07:47,197 --> 01:07:48,196
让那小子展示给你看
Let the young boy show you how it's done.

1547
01:07:48,598 --> 01:07:50,398
无任欢迎
He's sure welcome to it.

1548
01:07:54,371 --> 01:07:59,140
看他壮得像Joe Louis一样 [职业拳击手]
Look at that. Big, ol' strong boy, looks like Joe Louis.

1549
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:01,576
天啊, 我真的老了
Hell, I must be getting old

1550
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:03,611
看到他工作才感到岁月不饶人
the way I'm watching that boy whip through that wood.

1551
01:08:03,846 --> 01:08:06,381
我真不懂为何妈妈想要在后院筑起籓篱
I don't see why mama wants a fence around no yard no way.

1552
01:08:06,453 --> 01:08:07,453
我也想知道
Damn if I know, either.

1553
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:09,551
我不知道她在提防什么
I don't know what the hell she keeping out with it.

1554
01:08:09,553 --> 01:08:11,619
她又没什么别人想要的东西
She ain't got nothing nobody wants.

1555
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:14,856
有些人建籓篱来提防外面的人
Some people build fences to keep people out,

1556
01:08:14,858 --> 01:08:17,325
有些人则用来让围栏内的人留住
and other people build fences to keep people in.

1557
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:20,495
Rose想要留住你们, 她太爱你们了
Rose wants to hold on to you all. She loves you.

1558
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:24,299
朋友, 我不需要别人来提醒我我的妻子爱我
Hell, nigger, I don't need nobody to tell me my wife loves me.

1559
01:08:24,301 --> 01:08:27,836
Cory, 进去找找看有没有另一把木锯
Cory, go in the house and see if you can find the other saw.

1560
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:29,504
在哪?
Where's it at?

1561
01:08:29,506 --> 01:08:32,474
我说找找看, 看到你找到为止
I said find it. Look for it till you find it.

1562
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:38,580
把围栏内的人留住是什么意思?
What is that supposed to mean? Want to keep us in?

1563
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:54,395
Troy
Troy,

1564
01:08:54,397 --> 01:08:58,600
我几乎大半辈子都认识你
I done known you seem like damn near my whole life.

1565
01:08:58,602 --> 01:09:01,503
你和Rose两个都是, 认识很久了
You and Rose both. I known both of you all for a long time.

1566
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:05,206
我还记得当初你遇见Rose的时候
I remember when you met Rose.

1567
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:08,276
以前你在公园打棒球时
When you was hitting them baseball out of the park.

1568
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:10,645
很多女孩都追求你
A lot of them old gals was after you then.

1569
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:12,647
你简直是万人迷
You had the pick of the litter.

1570
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:16,518
当你选了Rose, 我很替你高兴
When you picked Rose, I was happy for you.

1571
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:20,655
那是第一次我觉得你有点理智
That's the first time I knew you had any sense.

1572
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:24,225
我想: 我的好朋友Troy知道他想要的
I said, "my man Troy knows what he's doing.

1573
01:09:24,227 --> 01:09:27,362
我会跟着他, 他可能会带我到前所未到过的地方
"I'm gonna follow this nigger, he might take me somewhere."

1574
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:29,631
而我真的跟着你了
I been following you, too.

1575
01:09:29,633 --> 01:09:33,434
我学到了一大堆关于因果的事
I done learned a whole heap of
things about life watching you.

1576
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:38,239
学到了哪些是屎
I done learned how to tell where the shit lies.

1577
01:09:38,241 --> 01:09:40,475
哪些是苜蓿 [分辨是非]
How to tell it from the alfalfa.

1578
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:43,611
你教了我很多事
You done learned me a lot of things.

1579
01:09:43,613 --> 01:09:46,447
教我不要重蹈覆辙
Showed me how to not make the same mistakes.

1580
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:48,583
不要一步登天
To take life as it come along,

1581
01:09:48,585 --> 01:09:51,452
一步一步的来
keep putting one foot in front of the other.

1582
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:53,354
Rose是个好女人, Troy
Rose is a good woman, Troy.

1583
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:54,522
我知道
I know she a good woman.

1584
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:56,157
我跟她结婚18年了
I've been married to her for 18 years.

1585
01:09:56,229 --> 01:09:57,629
你到底想说什么, Bono?
What you got on your mind, Bono?

1586
01:09:57,859 --> 01:10:00,195
我只是说她是个好女人, 没别的
I just say she's a good woman, like I say anything.

1587
01:10:00,197 --> 01:10:01,496
我不必暗示什么
I ain't got to have nothing on my mind.

1588
01:10:01,498 --> 01:10:02,831
你就抛出一句她是个好女人
You just say she a good woman and leave it

1589
01:10:02,903 --> 01:10:04,201
然后没有下文?
hanging out there like that?

1590
01:10:04,231 --> 01:10:05,552
你为何突然说她是个好女人?
Why are you telling me she a good woman?

1591
01:10:05,582 --> 01:10:08,203
她爱你, Troy
She loves you, Troy. Rose loves you.

1592
01:10:08,205 --> 01:10:09,275
你说我不配吗?
You saying I don't measure up?

1593
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:10,376
我认为那就是你想说的
That's what you tryin' to say.

1594
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:12,507
我不配她因为我在和别的女人在外面
I don't measure up 'cause I'm seeing this other gal.

1595
01:10:12,509 --> 01:10:13,641
我知道你暗示什么
I know what you tryin' to say.

1596
01:10:13,643 --> 01:10:15,977
我知道Rose对你来说有多大意义
I know what Rose means to you, Troy.

1597
01:10:15,979 --> 01:10:19,214
我只是想说我不想看见你对她不忠
I'm just tryin' to say I don't want to see you mess up.

1598
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,317
我明白
Yeah.

1599
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:28,590
感谢你
Well, I appreciate that, Bono.

1600
01:10:30,526 --> 01:10:32,260
如果你对Lucille不忠
If you was messing around on Lucille,

1601
01:10:32,262 --> 01:10:34,395
我也会跟你说同一番话
I'd be telling you the same thing.

1602
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:35,763
那就是我要说的了
That's all I got to say.

1603
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:39,767
我会说是因为我爱你们两个
I just say that 'cause I love you both.

1604
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:42,804
对
Oh. Yeah.

1605
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:46,341
你懂我的为人, 我没在外面拈花惹草
You know me. I wasn't out there looking for nothing.

1606
01:10:46,343 --> 01:10:48,710
我肯定你不会找到比Rose更好的女人
You can't find a better woman than Rose, I know that.

1607
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:52,779
但看来Alberta总黏着我
But it seems like this woman just stuck on to me

1608
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:53,314
我怎说她都不肯离开
where I can't shake her loose.

1609
01:10:53,316 --> 01:10:54,749
我试过跟她吵架或者避开她
I done wrestled with it and tried to throw her off,

1610
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:57,452
但她反倒更缠着我了
but now she stuck on tighter.

1611
01:10:57,454 --> 01:10:59,687
而现在她打算这辈子跟定我了
And now she stuck on for good.

1612
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:02,590
你总是告诉我你有分寸
You's in control. That's what you tell me all the time.

1613
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:04,459
你会对你做过的事负责任
You responsible for what you do.

1614
01:11:04,461 --> 01:11:06,361
我没在逃避责任
I ain't ducking the responsibility of it.

1615
01:11:06,363 --> 01:11:08,696
只要问心无愧就可以了
As long as it set right in my heart, then I'm okay.

1616
01:11:08,698 --> 01:11:11,699
因为那是我的宗旨, 它会告诉我是非对错
'Cause that's all I listen to. It tell me right and wrong every time.

1617
01:11:11,701 --> 01:11:13,668
而我也没说要对Rose不忠
And I ain't talking about doing Rose no bad turn.

1618
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:15,336
我爱她
I love Rose.

1619
01:11:15,338 --> 01:11:16,738
她跟我这么久了
She done carried me a long ways,

1620
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:18,373
我为此而爱她, 尊重她
and I love and respect her for that.

1621
01:11:18,445 --> 01:11:19,345
我知道
I know you do.

1622
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:21,676
那就是为什么我不想看到你伤害她
That's why I don't want to see you hurt her.

1623
01:11:21,678 --> 01:11:24,345
但要是她发现了怎办?
But what you gonna do when she finds out?

1624
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:26,681
你到时候会剩下什么?
What you got then?

1625
01:11:26,683 --> 01:11:28,349
你脚踏两只船
You try to juggle both of them,

1626
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:30,051
早晚也得二舍其一
sooner or later, you gonna drop one of them.

1627
01:11:30,053 --> 01:11:32,420
- 那是常识   - 我明白, Bono
- That's common sense. - I know what you're saying, Bono.

1628
01:11:33,822 --> 01:11:36,057
我一直在想办法
I been trying to figure a way to work it out.

1629
01:11:36,059 --> 01:11:38,359
尽快, Troy
Work it out right, Troy.

1630
01:11:38,361 --> 01:11:40,828
我不是想对你们的家事指指点点
I ain't trying to get all up between you and Rose's business,

1631
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:43,364
但趁事情还没转坏前赶快解决
but work it, so it come out right.

1632
01:11:43,366 --> 01:11:45,600
那我来介入你们的家事
Hell, I get all between you and Lucille's business.

1633
01:11:45,602 --> 01:11:47,302
你打算何时买
And when you gonna buy that woman

1634
01:11:47,304 --> 01:11:48,603
她一直想要的冰箱?
that refrigerator she be wanting?

1635
01:11:48,605 --> 01:11:50,471
别告诉我你没钱
And don't tell me you ain't got no money.

1636
01:11:50,543 --> 01:11:51,543
我知道谁替你打理财务
I know who your banker is.

1637
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:54,409
钱该花在Lucille的冰箱上而不是放在梅隆银行内
Mellon don't need that money as bad as Lucille wants that refrigerator.

1638
01:11:54,411 --> 01:11:55,480
我很清楚
I know that.

1639
01:11:55,482 --> 01:11:56,510
- 告诉你吧   - 什么?
- Tell you what I'll do.   - What?

1640
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:58,680
当你为Rose建成籓篱时
When you finish building this fence for Rose,

1641
01:11:58,682 --> 01:12:00,515
我就给Lucille买冰箱
I'll buy Lucille that refrigerator.

1642
01:12:00,517 --> 01:12:03,451
你会后悔的
You done stuck your foot in your mouth now.

1643
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,087
朋友, 你要去哪?
Hey, nigger, where you going?

1644
01:12:06,089 --> 01:12:07,522
我得回家
I'm going home.

1645
01:12:07,524 --> 01:12:09,424
你不是在想我会帮你吧
I know you don't expect me to help you now.

1646
01:12:09,426 --> 01:12:10,792
我得保住我的钱
I'm protecting my money.

1647
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:14,395
我想看你一个人慢慢的建
I want to see you put that fence up by yourself.

1648
01:12:14,397 --> 01:12:15,830
那就是我想看的
That's what I want to see.

1649
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:18,399
没有我的帮忙, 六个月后你仍然毫无头绪
You'll be here another six months without me.

1650
01:12:18,401 --> 01:12:19,667
朋友, 那样不对啊
Nigger, you ain't right.

1651
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:21,536
当谈到我的钱
When it come to my money,

1652
01:12:21,538 --> 01:12:24,639
我就像国庆日的烟火一样对[好]
I'm right as fireworks on the Fourth of July.

1653
01:12:24,641 --> 01:12:26,107
等着瞧
We gonna see.

1654
01:12:26,109 --> 01:12:27,809
你准备去提款吧!
You better get out your bank book!

1655
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:21,863
他们在警局在说了什么? Gabe怎了?
What they say down there? What's happening with Gabe?

1656
01:13:21,865 --> 01:13:24,899
我过去接回他了, 花了我五十块
I went down there and got him out. Cost me $50.

1657
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:26,601
说他在扰乱秩序
Said he was disturbing the peace.

1658
01:13:26,603 --> 01:13:28,903
法官三周后审讯
Judge set up a hearing for him in three weeks

1659
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:31,706
他为何不被重新分配到医院内
to show cause why he shouldn't be recommitted.

1660
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:33,574
那你怎说? 你怎跟法官说的
What'd you say? What'd you tell the judge?

1661
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:35,610
我跟他说我会照顾他
I told him I'd take care of him.

1662
01:13:35,612 --> 01:13:37,178
没有理由又分配他住医院
It didn't make no sense to recommit the man.

1663
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:38,679
他伸出他那贪婪的手
He stuck out his big greasy palm,

1664
01:13:38,681 --> 01:13:41,482
跟我说交出$50然后带他回家
told me to give him $50 and take him on home.

1665
01:13:41,484 --> 01:13:43,484
那他现在在哪?
Where's he at now? Where'd he go off to?

1666
01:13:43,486 --> 01:13:45,486
又到处乱跑了, 他不想别人拖着他的手
Gone about his business. He don't need nobody to hold his hand.

1667
01:13:45,488 --> 01:13:47,722
我也不知道, 但那看来是最好的选择
Well, I don't know, seem like that would be the best place for him.

1668
01:13:47,724 --> 01:13:48,756
让他住在医院里
To put him in a hospital.

1669
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:49,891
我知道你接下来要说什么
I know what you say gonna say,

1670
01:13:49,893 --> 01:13:51,526
但那正是我认为这样做是对的原因
but that's what I think would be best.

1671
01:13:51,528 --> 01:13:53,161
那他在打仗时失去的一切, 为了什么?
Man had his life ruined fighting for what?

1672
01:13:53,163 --> 01:13:54,595
现在他们想把他锁起来?
Now, they want to take him and lock him up?

1673
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:56,898
该给他自由啊, 他又没打扰谁
Let him be free. Man ain't bothering nobody.

1674
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:00,768
我想每个人都有不同的看法
Everybody got their own way of looking at it, I guess.

1675
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:02,170
来拿你的午餐吧
Come on, get your lunch.

1676
01:14:02,172 --> 01:14:03,805
我这里有些棉豆和玉米面包
I got some lima beans and cornbread in the oven.

1677
01:14:03,877 --> 01:14:04,977
快去, 你得吃点什么
Come on, get somethin' to eat.

1678
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:06,741
在这里烦恼Gabe的事也没帮助
Ain't no sense in you fretting over Gabe.

1679
01:14:06,813 --> 01:14:07,913
Rose, 我有点事要跟你说
Rose, I got something to tell you.

1680
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:10,912
- 待我把食物放好再说   - Rose...
- Wait till I put the food on the table. - Rose...

1681
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:14,715
我不知道该怎开口
Now, I don't know how to tell you this.

1682
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:20,655
但又不能瞒着你
And I can't explain it none.

1683
01:14:20,657 --> 01:14:23,825
[好感]就那么一点点的积聚啊
It just sort of grows on you.

1684
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,895
开始时就像小木灌
It started off like a little bush,

1685
01:14:27,897 --> 01:14:29,530
待你发现时已经是整片森林了
next thing you know, it's a whole forest.

1686
01:14:29,532 --> 01:14:30,765
Troy, 你在说什么?
Troy, what is you talking about?

1687
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:32,667
我在说话, 女人, 让我把话说完
I'm talking, woman. Let me talk.

1688
01:14:32,669 --> 01:14:34,635
我在跟你说
I'm trying to tell you,

1689
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:36,938
我在找个隐晦的方法跟你说...
find a way to tell you that...

1690
01:14:41,944 --> 01:14:44,579
我要成为父亲了
I'm gonna be a daddy.

1691
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:48,850
对, 我要成为别人的父亲了
Yeah, I'm gonna be somebody's daddy.

1692
01:14:53,555 --> 01:14:56,224
Troy, 不是真的吧? 你要成为什么?
Troy, you ain't telling me this. You're gonna be what?

1693
01:14:56,226 --> 01:14:57,692
- 你要成为别人的父亲?   - Rose...
- You're gonna be somebody's daddy?   - Rose...

1694
01:14:57,694 --> 01:14:58,793
你竟然跟你的妻子说这个?
You're telling your wife this?

1695
01:14:58,795 --> 01:14:59,861
现在...
Now...

1696
01:14:59,863 --> 01:15:02,230
嗨, Troy, 嗨, Rose
Hey, Troy! Hey, Rose!

1697
01:15:02,232 --> 01:15:04,866
我等了18年就为了听你说这些事吗?
I got to wait 18 years to hear something like this?

1698
01:15:04,868 --> 01:15:06,501
嗨, Rose
Hey, Rose.

1699
01:15:07,971 --> 01:15:10,638
我有朵花送给你
I got a flower for you.

1700
01:15:12,975 --> 01:15:16,777
那是朵玫瑰花, 就像你的名字一样
That's a rose. The same rose like you is.

1701
01:15:21,717 --> 01:15:23,017
谢了, Gabe
Thanks, Gabe.

1702
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:24,689
Troy, 你没在生我的气吧?
Troy, you ain't mad at me?

1703
01:15:24,691 --> 01:15:26,719
那些坏人抓了我回来
Them bad mens come and put me away.

1704
01:15:26,721 --> 01:15:28,723
- 你没在生我的气吧?   - 没, 我没有生气
- You ain't mad at me?   - No. No, I ain't mad at you.

1705
01:15:28,725 --> 01:15:30,725
18年了, 你竟然做得出这种事?
Eighteen years, and you want to come with this?

1706
01:15:30,727 --> 01:15:33,561
看我拿到了什么? 一个全新的25美分
See what I got? Got a brand-new quarter.

1707
01:15:36,264 --> 01:15:37,465
Rose, 只是...
Rose, it's just that...

1708
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:39,734
你没什么可以说, 也不用解释
Ain't nothing you can say, Troy. Ain't no explaining it.

1709
01:15:39,736 --> 01:15:42,603
给我这25美分的人还有一大堆
The fella that give me this quarter had a whole mess of 'em!

1710
01:15:42,605 --> 01:15:44,939
我要留着它直到它暗哑无光
I'm gonna keep this quarter till it stops shining.

1711
01:15:44,941 --> 01:15:47,742
Gabe, 出去前门等我, 我冰箱里有西瓜
Gabe, go on up front now.
I got some watermelon in the frigidaire.

1712
01:15:47,814 --> 01:15:48,914
快去, 我待会拿给你
Go on. I'll get you a piece.

1713
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:51,746
Rose, 听我说, 我当时在追赶地狱之犬
Say, Rose, you know, I was chasing hellhounds,

1714
01:15:51,748 --> 01:15:54,749
然后那些坏人把我抓回去锁起来了
and them bad mens come and get me and take me away.

1715
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:56,817
Troy救了我, 他来了并跟他们说
Troy helped me. He come down there and told them

1716
01:15:56,819 --> 01:15:59,820
他们最好在他打跨他们之前放了我
they better let me go before he beat them up!

1717
01:15:59,892 --> 01:16:00,992
他真的说了
Yeah, he did!

1718
01:16:01,022 --> 01:16:03,624
出去吧, Gabe, 我待会给你西瓜
Go up front now, Gabe. I'll get you some watermelon.

1719
01:16:03,626 --> 01:16:04,959
那些坏人都走了
Them bad men is gone now.

1720
01:16:04,961 --> 01:16:07,628
好吧, Rose要给我西瓜
Okay. Rose gonna give me some watermelon,

1721
01:16:07,630 --> 01:16:09,997
有条纹的那种
the kind with the stripes on it.

1722
01:16:15,637 --> 01:16:16,938
为什么, Troy?
Why, Troy?

1723
01:16:18,739 --> 01:16:19,740
为什么?
Why?

1724
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:25,646
过了那么多年, 你现在跟我说这些?
After all these years, you come dragging this in to me now?

1725
01:16:25,648 --> 01:16:27,815
你这年纪, 不应该会做的
It don't make no sense at your age.

1726
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:32,353
我可以理解你十年或者十五年前这样做, 但不是现在
I could've expected this 10, or 15 years ago, but not now.

1727
01:16:32,355 --> 01:16:34,822
年龄与此没有关系, Rose
Age ain't got nothing to do with it, Rose.

1728
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:42,029
我做了一个妻子该做的
I done tried to be everything a wife should be.

1729
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:45,637
一个妻子可以做的所有事
Everything a wife could be.

1730
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:46,838
我结婚整整18年了
I've been married 18 years,

1731
01:16:47,168 --> 01:16:49,337
而现在竟到了你说
and now, I got to live to see the day you tell me

1732
01:16:49,339 --> 01:16:52,940
你和别的女人有了孩子的一天
you been seeing another woman and done fathered a child by her.

1733
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:10,057
你明知道我不喜欢同父异母什么的
And you know I never wanted no half-nothing in my family!

1734
01:17:12,995 --> 01:17:14,362
我整个家庭都是这样
My whole family is half.

1735
01:17:14,364 --> 01:17:16,130
每个人都有不同的父母亲
Everybody got different fathers and mothers

1736
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:17,898
我的几个兄弟姊妹都是这样
and my two sisters and my brothers.

1737
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:19,700
你根本不知道谁是谁生的
You could hardly tell who's who.

1738
01:17:19,702 --> 01:17:21,369
永远不能好好谈谈父母的话题
Could never sit down and talk about papa and mama.

1739
01:17:21,371 --> 01:17:24,038
因为大家的父母都不一样
It was always your papa, your mama, my papa, my mama.

1740
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,807
我从不想我的孩子们也是这样
And I ain't never wanted that for none of my children!

1741
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:28,042
然而现在, 你竟然过来
And now, you want to drag your behind in here

1742
01:17:28,114 --> 01:17:29,214
跟我说这些事!
and tell me something like this!

1743
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:32,178
够了, 你有权利知道的, 是时候了
Stop it now. You ought to know. It's time for you to know.

1744
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:33,080
我才不想知道, 妈的!
Well, I don't want to know, god damn it!

1745
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,001
Rose?
Rose?

1746
01:17:57,139 --> 01:18:00,808
我不能让她堕胎, 米已成炊了
I just can't make it go away. It's done now.

1747
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:04,879
我没法改变事情
I can't wish the circumstances of the thing away.

1748
01:18:04,881 --> 01:18:07,448
你也不想改变
And you don't want to, either.

1749
01:18:07,450 --> 01:18:09,216
或许你想我们两母子离开
Maybe you want to wish me and my boy away.

1750
01:18:09,218 --> 01:18:10,885
也许那就是你想的
Maybe that's what you want.

1751
01:18:10,887 --> 01:18:13,421
你不能这样做
Well, you can't wish us away.

1752
01:18:13,423 --> 01:18:15,456
我把我的18年放在你身上了
I got 18 years of my life invested in you.

1753
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:17,725
你该留在我们的床上而不是出去鬼混
You ought to have stayed upstairs in my bed where you belong.

1754
01:18:17,727 --> 01:18:20,161
听着, 我们可以处理好这事
Now, listen to me. We can get a handle on this thing.

1755
01:18:20,163 --> 01:18:22,296
我们可以说清楚, 有共识
We can talk this out, come to an understanding.

1756
01:18:22,298 --> 01:18:23,464
突然间此事就是关于"我们"
All of a sudden it's "we."

1757
01:18:23,466 --> 01:18:24,899
当你在外面
Where was "we" at when
you were down there,

1758
01:18:24,901 --> 01:18:26,467
跟那个可恶的女人鬼混时"我们"在哪里?
rolling around with some godforsaken woman?

1759
01:18:26,469 --> 01:18:27,702
"我们"该在你做傻事之前
"We" should've come to an understanding

1760
01:18:27,704 --> 01:18:29,136
就要有共识!
before you started making a damn fool of yourself!

1761
01:18:29,138 --> 01:18:30,805
当说到共识时
You're a day late and a dollar short

1762
01:18:30,807 --> 01:18:32,106
你总是迟了
when it comes to an understanding with me.

1763
01:18:32,108 --> 01:18:38,012
Rose, 只是因为她能给我完全不同的感觉
Rose, it's just that she...gives me a different idea.

1764
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:41,782
完全不同的自我理解
A different understanding about myself.

1765
01:18:41,784 --> 01:18:45,152
让我可以在这里走出去时, 放下所有压力
I can step out of this house and get away from the pressures

1766
01:18:45,154 --> 01:18:46,787
和问题, 变成一个完全不同的人
and the problems, be a different man.

1767
01:18:46,789 --> 01:18:48,723
我不用担心如何修好屋顶
I ain't got to worry about how I'll get the roof fixed,

1768
01:18:48,725 --> 01:18:50,191
或者付钱, 或者...
or pay the bills, or...

1769
01:18:50,193 --> 01:18:51,826
我可以
I can just

1770
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:56,163
成为一个我前所未有过的自己
be a part of myself I ain't never been before.

1771
01:18:57,232 --> 01:18:59,767
我想知道的是...
What I want to know is...

1772
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:04,772
我想知道的是
What I want to know

1773
01:19:04,774 --> 01:19:07,241
你是否打算继续见她?
is do you plan to continue seeing her?

1774
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:09,877
那就是你可以说的
That's all you can say to me.

1775
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:12,813
我在她的家里能放松下来
I could sit up in her house and laugh.

1776
01:19:12,815 --> 01:19:15,082
你明白吗?
You understand what I'm saying?

1777
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:17,885
我可以放声笑, 而那感觉真好
I could laugh out loud, and it feels good.

1778
01:19:17,887 --> 01:19:20,087
简直好到了我心底里
It reaches all the way down to the bottom of my shoes.

1779
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:21,288
Rose, 我...
Rose, I...

1780
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:26,794
我不想放弃那些
I can't give that up.

1781
01:19:32,234 --> 01:19:34,535
那或许你该继续留在她那里
Well, maybe you ought to go on and stay down there with her,

1782
01:19:34,537 --> 01:19:36,237
如果她真是比我更好的女人的话
if she's a better woman than me.

1783
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:38,105
这不是关于谁是更好的女人的问题
It ain't about nobody being a better woman, or nothing.

1784
01:19:38,177 --> 01:19:39,177
Rose, 你尽责了
Rose, you ain't to blame.

1785
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:41,976
做妻子的话你简直是不二之选
A man couldn't ask for a better wife than you've been.

1786
01:19:41,978 --> 01:19:43,481
这事我得负起所有责任
I'm responsible for it.

1787
01:19:43,483 --> 01:19:45,511
我每天重复做着同样的事
I done locked myself into a pattern,

1788
01:19:45,513 --> 01:19:47,181
照顾你们, 都让我忘了自己了
trying to take care of you all, that I forgot about myself.

1789
01:19:47,183 --> 01:19:48,983
我不是一直在你背后吗?
Well, what the hell was I there for?

1790
01:19:48,985 --> 01:19:50,551
那是我的工作, 不是他人的
That was my job, not somebody else's.

1791
01:19:50,553 --> 01:19:53,854
Rose, 听着, 我竭尽所能去过正当的生活
Rose, listen to me. I done tried all my life to live decent.

1792
01:19:53,856 --> 01:19:56,857
一个正当, 努力向上的生活
To live a clean, hard, useful life.

1793
01:19:56,859 --> 01:20:00,027
我尽了力去成为一个好丈夫
I try to be a good husband to you, in every way I know how.

1794
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:02,196
可能我一开始就错了吧, 我不知道
Maybe I come into the world backwards, I don't know,

1795
01:20:02,198 --> 01:20:05,833
但你就像上场前已经被二振了一样
but you're born with two strikes on you before you come to the plate.

1796
01:20:05,905 --> 01:20:06,905
你得把任何事都看管好
You got to guard it closely,

1797
01:20:06,935 --> 01:20:09,570
老是担心突发事情
always looking for the curveball on the inside corner.

1798
01:20:09,572 --> 01:20:11,238
你不能让任何事不受你控制
You can't afford a called strike.

1799
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,873
你不能让任何事漏掉
You can't let nothing get past you.

1800
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:15,009
要是你倒下了, 你还不死心
If you're going down, you're doing down swinging.

1801
01:20:15,011 --> 01:20:17,912
所有事都像对着你干一样
Everything lined up against you!

1802
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:21,015
你还想怎样?
What you gonna do?

1803
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:25,052
我赢了他们, Rose, 我短打了 [牺牲]
I fooled them, Rose. I bunted.

1804
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:29,223
当我有你和Cory和份有点像样的工作, 我很安全
When I found you and Cory and a halfway decent job, I was safe.

1805
01:20:29,225 --> 01:20:31,559
没什么可以拖累我了
Couldn't nothing touch me!

1806
01:20:31,561 --> 01:20:33,127
我不会再被三振出局
I wasn't gonna strike out no more.

1807
01:20:33,129 --> 01:20:34,562
不会再回去坐牢
I wasn't going back to the penitentiary.

1808
01:20:34,564 --> 01:20:37,031
不会再喝醉, 睡在街上
I wasn't gonna lie in the street with a bottle of wine.

1809
01:20:37,033 --> 01:20:41,302
我安全了, 我有个家庭, 有份工作
I was safe. I had me a family, a job.

1810
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:45,206
我不会被三振的
I wasn't gonna get that last strike.

1811
01:20:47,042 --> 01:20:49,977
我站在一垒
I was standing on first base,

1812
01:20:49,979 --> 01:20:53,012
等着回到本垒
waiting for one of them boys to
knock me in, to bring me home.

1813
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:53,884
你该留在我们的床上, Troy
You should have stayed in my bed, Troy.

1814
01:20:53,886 --> 01:20:55,914
然后我看到那女子, 她让我胆大起来
Then I saw the gal, she firmed up my backbone.

1815
01:20:55,916 --> 01:20:58,285
我在想如果我努力点, 或许可以盗垒
I got to thinkin' that if I tried, maybe I could steal second.

1816
01:20:58,287 --> 01:21:00,087
- 你明白吗?   - 你该抱紧我
- You understand what I'm saying? - You should've held me tight.

1817
01:21:00,089 --> 01:21:02,388
你该捉紧我的手
You should've grabbed me and held on.

1818
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:03,324
我站在一垒18年了
I stood on first base for 18 years,

1819
01:21:03,326 --> 01:21:05,960
然后我想, 管他的, 豁出去
and I thought, well, god damn it, go on for it!

1820
01:21:05,962 --> 01:21:08,295
我们不是在说棒球啊!
We ain't talking about baseball!

1821
01:21:08,297 --> 01:21:10,898
我们在说你跟别的女人鬼混
We talking about you going off and laying up with another woman,

1822
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:11,932
然后把这事带回家跟我说
then bringing it home to me.

1823
01:21:11,934 --> 01:21:13,067
那才是我们要讨论的
That's what we're talking about.

1824
01:21:13,069 --> 01:21:16,173
- 我们不是要谈棒球!   - Rose, 你没细心听
- We're not talkin' about no baseball! - Rose, you're not listening to me.

1825
01:21:16,203 --> 01:21:18,339
我在用我最擅长的东西去表达
I'm trying to explain it to you the best way I know how.

1826
01:21:20,007 --> 01:21:21,508
对我来说很难去接受
It's not easy for me to admit

1827
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:24,378
我站在原地18年了这事实
that I've been standing in the same place for 18 years!

1828
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:27,114
我也跟你一起站在原地啊!
Well, I've been standing with you!

1829
01:21:27,116 --> 01:21:31,185
我一直都跟你站在原地, Troy! 我也有我的人生
I've been right here with you, Troy! I got a life, too.

1830
01:21:31,187 --> 01:21:35,389
我为此付出了我的18年啊
I gave 18 years of my life to stand in the same spot as you!

1831
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:37,424
你没想过我也想要做其他事?
Don't you think I ever wanted other things?

1832
01:21:37,426 --> 01:21:39,927
没想过我也有我的梦想和愿望?
Don't you think I had dreams and hopes?

1833
01:21:39,929 --> 01:21:42,363
那我的生命呢? 那我呢?
What about my life? What about me?

1834
01:21:42,365 --> 01:21:43,964
你以为我没有想过
Don't you think it ever crossed my mind

1835
01:21:43,966 --> 01:21:45,132
去认识其他男人?
to want to know other men?

1836
01:21:45,134 --> 01:21:47,902
或者一走了之
That I wanted to lay up somewhere

1837
01:21:47,904 --> 01:21:49,403
忘了我的职责?
and forget about my responsibilities?

1838
01:21:49,405 --> 01:21:51,205
或者我想有过人让我笑
That I wanted someone to make me laugh,

1839
01:21:51,207 --> 01:21:53,274
让我快乐?
so I could feel good?

1840
01:21:53,276 --> 01:21:55,376
你不是唯一一个有需求的人
You're not the only one who's got wants and needs.

1841
01:21:55,378 --> 01:21:57,378
但我留下来了, Troy
But I held on to you, Troy.

1842
01:21:57,380 --> 01:22:01,916
我把我的所有情感, 需求和梦想
I took all my feelings, my wants and needs and dreams,

1843
01:22:01,918 --> 01:22:03,651
埋藏在你的心底下
and I buried them inside you.

1844
01:22:03,653 --> 01:22:06,086
我把种子埋藏好, 每天看着它, 祈望它成长
I planted a seed and watched and prayed over it.

1845
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:09,123
我把自己埋藏在你心内然后等待开花!
I planted myself inside you and waited to bloom!

1846
01:22:09,125 --> 01:22:10,991
但那花了我18年时间
And it didn't take me no 18 years

1847
01:22:10,993 --> 01:22:13,093
才知道那泥土原来如石头般硬
to realize the soil was hard and rocky,

1848
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:15,195
还有它根本不会开花!
and it wasn't never gonna bloom!

1849
01:22:15,197 --> 01:22:18,198
但我仍然捉紧你, 我把你捉得更紧
But I held on to you, Troy. I held you tighter.

1850
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,267
你是我的丈夫
You was my husband.

1851
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:23,070
我该给你我的全部
I owed you everything I had.

1852
01:22:23,072 --> 01:22:25,940
我的每一部分
Every part of me I could find to give you.

1853
01:22:25,942 --> 01:22:29,677
当晚上我在楼上的睡房时
And upstairs in that bedroom, with the darkness falling in on me,

1854
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:34,014
我用尽力气消除那个疑虑
I gave everything I had to try and erase the doubt

1855
01:22:34,016 --> 01:22:36,483
那个其实你不是个好男人的疑虑
that you wasn't the finest man in the world.

1856
01:22:36,485 --> 01:22:39,353
无论你打算去哪里, 我都会跟着你
And wherever you was going, i was gonna be there with you,

1857
01:22:39,355 --> 01:22:42,089
因为你是我的丈夫
because you was my husband.

1858
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:46,360
因为这样做我才能继续做你的妻子
'Cause that's the only way I was gonna survive as your wife.

1859
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:50,030
你经常说给什么
You always talking about what you give

1860
01:22:50,032 --> 01:22:51,332
还有你不能给什么
and what you don't have to give.

1861
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:53,701
但你也会拿取, Troy
But you take, too, Troy.

1862
01:22:53,703 --> 01:22:56,370
你会拿取而且不在乎是谁付出的
You take and don't even know nobody's giving.

1863
01:22:56,372 --> 01:22:58,438
你说我好逸恶劳
You say I take and don't give.

1864
01:22:58,510 --> 01:22:59,610
- Troy, 你弄痛我了   - 你说我好逸恶劳
- Troy, you're hurting me.   - You say I take and don't give.

1865
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,108
- Troy, 我的手很痛, 放手!   - 我给了我能给的
- Troy, you're hurting my arm, let go!
- I gave you everything I got.

1866
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:02,176
别说我没有
Don't you tell that lie on me.

1867
01:23:02,178 --> 01:23:03,477
- 妈妈!   - 别说我没有
- Mama!   - Don't you tell that lie!

1868
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:05,245
Troy, 我弄痛我了!
Troy, you're hurting me!

1869
01:23:05,714 --> 01:23:07,214
Troy! Troy!
Troy! Troy!

1870
01:23:07,415 --> 01:23:11,251
好了, 那是二振
All right. That's strike two.

1871
01:23:12,087 --> 01:23:16,290
你别再惹我, 你最好别三振
You stay away from around me, boy. Don't you strike out.

1872
01:23:18,026 --> 01:23:20,094
你满球数了
You're living with a full count.

1873
01:23:23,365 --> 01:23:25,332
你最好别三振!
Don't you strike out!

1874
01:26:45,633 --> 01:26:47,601
Troy, 我想跟你说点事
Troy, I want to talk to you.

1875
01:26:50,305 --> 01:26:52,472
突然间?
All of a sudden?

1876
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:56,743
过了这么久你想跟我说点事?
After all this time, you want to talk to me, huh?

1877
01:26:57,745 --> 01:26:59,446
你数个月来没跟我说过一句话
You ain't wanted to talk to me in months.

1878
01:26:59,448 --> 01:27:00,714
昨晚也没有
You ain't wanted to talk to me last night.

1879
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:02,449
你那时可不想理会我
You didn't want no parts of me then.

1880
01:27:02,951 --> 01:27:05,219
现在你想来说什么?
What you want to talk to me about now?

1881
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:10,290
明天是星期五
Tomorrow's Friday.

1882
01:27:10,292 --> 01:27:11,595
我知道
I know what day tomorrow is.

1883
01:27:11,597 --> 01:27:13,625
你以为我不知道吗?
You think I don't know tomorrow's Friday?

1884
01:27:13,627 --> 01:27:16,295
我的整生, 都在等星期五的来临
My whole life, I ain't done nothing but look to see Friday coming,

1885
01:27:16,297 --> 01:27:16,963
你还来提醒我
and you got to tell me it's Friday.

1886
01:27:16,965 --> 01:27:18,298
我想知道你会否回家
I want to know if you're coming home.

1887
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,301
我每天都回家, 你知道的
I always come home, Rose. You know that.

1888
01:27:21,303 --> 01:27:22,569
没有一晚我是没回来的
Ain't never been a night I ain't come home.

1889
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:24,504
你明知道那不是我的意思
That ain't what I mean, and you know it.

1890
01:27:24,506 --> 01:27:27,975
我想知道你下班后会否直接回家
I wanna know if you're coming straight home after work.

1891
01:27:27,977 --> 01:27:31,011
我想我会兑换支票, 然后在Taylor的酒吧和他们喝点酒
I figured I'd cash my check,
hang out at Taylors' with the boys.

1892
01:27:31,083 --> 01:27:32,283
或许玩一局[西洋]跳棋
Maybe play a game of checkers.

1893
01:27:32,313 --> 01:27:34,781
Troy, 我不能再继续这样, 我接受不了
Troy, I can't live like this. I won't live like this.

1894
01:27:34,783 --> 01:27:36,450
自那之后你就人在心不在
You're living on borrowed time with me.

1895
01:27:36,452 --> 01:27:38,485
六个月以来, 你都没真正回来
Been going on six months now, you ain't been coming home.

1896
01:27:38,487 --> 01:27:40,587
我每晚都回来, 一年来从没间断过
I come home every night. Every night of the year.

1897
01:27:40,589 --> 01:27:43,323
那就整整365天
That's 365 days.

1898
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:47,394
我想你明天下班后直接回家
I want you to come home tomorrow after work.

1899
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:55,802
Rose, 你知道我不会乱花钱
Rose, I don't mess up my pay. You know that.

1900
01:27:55,804 --> 01:27:57,771
我收到工资后就全数交给你
I take my pay, i give it to you.

1901
01:27:57,773 --> 01:28:01,441
我只拿着你分配给我的部份
I don't have no money but what you give me back.

1902
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:04,611
我只想要一点私人时间而已
I just want a little time to myself.

1903
01:28:04,613 --> 01:28:05,779
去享乐一下
A little time to enjoy life.

1904
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:07,748
那我呢? 何时才轮到我去享乐?
What about me? When's my time to enjoy life?

1905
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:10,017
我不知道还可以说什么, 我已经尽力了
I don't know what to tell you, Rose. I'm doing the best I can.

1906
01:28:10,089 --> 01:28:11,381
你下班回家后
You ain't been comin' home from work,

1907
01:28:11,411 --> 01:28:12,587
只换件衣服又出去了
but time enough to change your clothes and run out.

1908
01:28:12,749 --> 01:28:14,655
你叫那尽力吗?
You wanna call that the best you can do?

1909
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:19,426
我晚点得去医院看Alberta
I'm going over to the hospital to see Alberta.

1910
01:28:20,395 --> 01:28:22,062
她今天下午进了医院
She went into the hospital this afternoon.

1911
01:28:22,064 --> 01:28:25,599
看来是早产
Looks like she might have the baby early.

1912
01:28:26,467 --> 01:28:28,302
我不会去太久
I won't be gone long.

1913
01:28:34,509 --> 01:28:36,410
你该知道他们今天到了Pearl小姐那里
Well, you ought to know. They went over to Miss Pearl's

1914
01:28:36,482 --> 01:28:37,582
带走了Gabe
and got Gabe today.

1915
01:28:37,612 --> 01:28:41,515
她说你叫他们锁起他来
She said you told them to go ahead and lock him up.

1916
01:28:41,517 --> 01:28:45,552
我才没有说过, 你被她骗了
I ain't said no such thing. Whoever told you that is telling a lie.

1917
01:28:45,554 --> 01:28:47,421
Pearl小姐撒了个很大的谎
Miss Pearl ain't doing nothing but telling a big, fat lie.

1918
01:28:47,423 --> 01:28:49,389
她不用说出口, 我在文件上看到的
She ain't had to tell me. I read it on the papers.

1919
01:28:49,391 --> 01:28:51,525
- 那份文件说了什么?   - 说你叫他们去带走他
- What'd it say, huh?   - It said you told them to take him.

1920
01:28:51,527 --> 01:28:53,047
那他们肯定弄错了
Oh, well, then they screwed that up,

1921
01:28:53,077 --> 01:28:54,568
就像他们弄错其他事一样
just like they screw up everything.

1922
01:28:54,598 --> 01:28:55,626
我才不在意他们在文件上说了什么
I ain't worried about what they got on that paper.

1923
01:28:55,628 --> 01:28:57,097
说政府会把他的部分财产交给医院作照顾费用
It say the government sends part of the check to the hospital,

1924
01:28:57,169 --> 01:28:58,269
另一部份交给你
the other part to you.

1925
01:28:58,299 --> 01:29:00,833
我跟此事毫无关系
I ain't got nothing to do with that, if that's the way it works.

1926
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:01,335
我也没叫他们分给我
I don't make up the rules...

1927
01:29:01,337 --> 01:29:02,536
你对待Gabe就像你对待Cory一样差劲
You did Gabe just like you did Cory.

1928
01:29:02,538 --> 01:29:03,737
你不会替Cory签署
You wouldn't sign the paper for Cory,

1929
01:29:03,739 --> 01:29:05,539
但你却替Gabe签了, 是你签的!
but you signed for Gabe! You signed that paper!

1930
01:29:05,541 --> 01:29:08,507
我说过我没有签署过什么, 女人
I told you I ain't signed nothing, woman.

1931
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:10,076
天啊, 我只签了份释放同意书
Hell, the only thing I signed was the release form.

1932
01:29:10,148 --> 01:29:10,548
我又不识字
Hell, I can't read,

1933
01:29:10,578 --> 01:29:11,611
天知道他们在同意书上写了什么
I don't know what they had on that paper.

1934
01:29:11,613 --> 01:29:13,547
我才没签过什么送走Gabe的文件
I ain't signed nothing about sending Gabe away.

1935
01:29:13,549 --> 01:29:15,749
我当时说送他到医院, 你说要让他自由
I said send him to the hospital, you said let him go free.

1936
01:29:15,821 --> 01:29:16,921
现在你反过来
Then you went down there

1937
01:29:16,951 --> 01:29:19,085
同意送他到医院, 就为了他的钱
and you signed him to the hospital for half his money.

1938
01:29:19,087 --> 01:29:19,656
这是自相矛盾, Troy
You went back on yourself, Troy.

1939
01:29:19,658 --> 01:29:21,686
你会有报应的
You're gonna have to answer for that.

1940
01:29:21,688 --> 01:29:22,522
你才跟Pearl小姐说过话
You just been over there talking to Miss Pearl.

1941
01:29:22,524 --> 01:29:23,824
她只是因为不能再
She just mad 'cause she ain't gettin'

1942
01:29:23,826 --> 01:29:25,092
骗Gabe的钱而生气, 所以胡说而已
Gabe's rent money, that's all it is.

1943
01:29:25,094 --> 01:29:27,026
Troy, 我亲眼看着你签的!
Troy, I seen where you signed the paper!

1944
01:29:27,098 --> 01:29:27,798
你才没有!
You ain't seen nothing I signed!

1945
01:29:27,828 --> 01:29:30,630
那她家里为何又有我弟弟的文件?
And what she doing got papers on my brother for, anyway?

1946
01:29:30,766 --> 01:29:34,434
Pearl小姐只是在撒谎
Miss Pearl ain't doing nothing but telling a big, fat lie,

1947
01:29:34,436 --> 01:29:36,403
我会去跟她对质!
and I'm gonna tell her about it, too!

1948
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:44,711
我没有签署过什么!
You ain't seen nothing I signed!

1949
01:29:45,446 --> 01:29:46,780
还说我...
Say...

1950
01:29:48,616 --> 01:29:50,784
我没有签署过什么!
You ain't seen nothing I signed!

1951
01:31:47,602 --> 01:31:48,969
Troy.
Troy.

1952
01:31:51,239 --> 01:31:52,839
Troy.
Troy.

1953
01:31:57,945 --> 01:32:00,914
那是医院打来说Alberta生下来了
That was the hospital. Alberta had the baby.

1954
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:04,918
是吗? 是男还是女的?
Yeah? What she have? What is it?

1955
01:32:05,887 --> 01:32:07,654
是个女孩
It's a girl.

1956
01:32:10,258 --> 01:32:11,892
我...
I...

1957
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:17,063
我该去看她一下
I better get on down there to see her.

1958
01:32:18,899 --> 01:32:18,900
Troy.
Troy.

1959
01:32:18,901 --> 01:32:22,969
- Troy   - 我总得去看她一下吧, Rose
- Troy. - I got to go see her now, Rose. That's only right.

1960
01:32:28,075 --> 01:32:31,711
怎么了? 婴儿什么有问题吗?
What's the matter? Baby all right, ain't it?

1961
01:32:34,815 --> 01:32:37,918
Alberta产后死去了
Alberta died having the baby.

1962
01:32:38,986 --> 01:32:41,054
你说她死了?
She died? You say she's dead?

1963
01:32:44,091 --> 01:32:45,725
她死了?
Alberta dead?

1964
01:32:46,294 --> 01:32:48,828
他们说尽了力, 他们...
They said they done all they could. They...

1965
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:51,765
他们对她无能为力
They couldn't do nothing for her.

1966
01:33:22,797 --> 01:33:25,765
那婴儿呢? 她还好吗?
Oh, what about the baby? Baby all right?

1967
01:33:27,668 --> 01:33:29,769
他们说她很健康
They say it's healthy.

1968
01:33:31,906 --> 01:33:33,607
我在想谁会替她办身后事
I wonder who's gonna bury her.

1969
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:34,779
她有家人的, Rose
She had a family, Rose.

1970
01:33:34,809 --> 01:33:36,042
她不是无亲无故
She wasn't living in the world by herself.

1971
01:33:36,044 --> 01:33:38,645
我当然知道
I know she wasn't living in the world by herself.

1972
01:33:38,647 --> 01:33:39,946
你下一样想知道的就是她有没有保险
Next thing you wanna know if she had any insurance.

1973
01:33:40,018 --> 01:33:41,218
你没资格跟我这样说话!
You ain't got to talk to me like that!

1974
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:43,683
你第一样关心的就是: 谁会埋葬她?
First thing that jumped out your mouth. "Who's gonna bury her?"

1975
01:33:43,685 --> 01:33:45,085
生怕我会付钱替她办理
Like I'm finna take that task on for myself.

1976
01:33:45,087 --> 01:33:47,153
我是你的妻子, 别推开我
I'm your wife. Don't push me away.

1977
01:33:47,155 --> 01:33:49,823
我没有推开谁, 就给我点空间
I ain't pushing nobody away. Just give me some space.

1978
01:33:49,825 --> 01:33:52,058
让我静一下
Just give me some room to breathe.

1979
01:34:22,189 --> 01:34:24,257
好了, 死神先生
All right, Mr. Death.

1980
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:32,732
我来告诉你接下来的事
I tell you what I'm gonna do.

1981
01:34:32,734 --> 01:34:35,135
我会继续
I'm gonna take

1982
01:34:35,137 --> 01:34:39,205
在这后院筑起籓篱, 知道吗?
and build me a fence around this yard, see?

1983
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:44,411
我会筑起籓篱保护属于我的东西
I'm gonna build me a fence around what belongs to me.

1984
01:34:44,413 --> 01:34:47,747
然后我想你留在另一边
And then I want you to stay on the other side.

1985
01:34:47,749 --> 01:34:49,215
直至你准备好带走我
You stay over there till you're ready for me,

1986
01:34:49,217 --> 01:34:51,017
到时候你就尽管来吧
then you come on.

1987
01:34:53,154 --> 01:34:56,956
带上你的军队, 镰刀, 披上你的袍子
Bring your army, bring your sickle, bring your wrestling clothes.

1988
01:34:56,958 --> 01:34:59,125
这次我不会松懈
I ain't gonna fall down on my vigilance this time.

1989
01:34:59,127 --> 01:35:00,860
你不会...
You ain't gonna...

1990
01:35:03,864 --> 01:35:06,099
你不会就有机可乘
You ain't gonna sneak up on me no more.

1991
01:35:08,803 --> 01:35:10,036
当你准备好时
When you ready for me,

1992
01:35:10,038 --> 01:35:12,439
当你手上的名单写着Troy Maxson时
when the top of your list say Troy Maxson,

1993
01:35:12,441 --> 01:35:14,774
到时候你就正面而来吧
then you come on up and knock on the front door.

1994
01:35:14,776 --> 01:35:16,776
其他人与此无关
Ain't nobody else got nothing to do with this.

1995
01:35:16,778 --> 01:35:18,778
这是你我之间的事
This between you and me.

1996
01:35:21,082 --> 01:35:23,116
男人之间!
Man to man!

1997
01:35:28,889 --> 01:35:32,859
你在准备好带走我之前留在籓篱的另一边!
You stay on the other side of that fence till you ready for me!

1998
01:35:34,195 --> 01:35:36,930
然后随时都可以
Then you come up and knock on that front door

1999
01:35:36,932 --> 01:35:40,800
与我正面对决!
anytime you want!

2000
01:35:52,813 --> 01:35:54,814
我拭目以待
I'll be ready for you.

2001
01:36:44,265 --> 01:36:45,799
Rose?
Rose?

2002
01:36:47,935 --> 01:36:50,904
我在抱着我的女孩
I'm standing here with my daughter in my arms.

2003
01:36:50,906 --> 01:36:52,972
听着
Now,

2004
01:36:52,974 --> 01:36:56,042
她只不过是一个
she ain't but a wee,

2005
01:36:57,177 --> 01:36:58,578
初生的婴儿而已
bitty little old thing.

2006
01:36:58,579 --> 01:37:01,014
她跟大人间的事没有关系
She don't know nothing about grownfolk business.

2007
01:37:01,016 --> 01:37:02,415
她是无辜的
She innocent,

2008
01:37:04,552 --> 01:37:06,920
但她没有母亲
and she ain't got no mama.

2009
01:37:08,989 --> 01:37:10,990
你为何告诉我这些, Troy?
What you telling me for, Troy?

2010
01:37:24,271 --> 01:37:26,105
那...
Well...

2011
01:37:27,908 --> 01:37:30,143
我们在外面门廊好了
Guess we'll go sit out here on the porch.

2012
01:37:48,629 --> 01:37:50,864
一个男人应该做他认为正确的事
A man's got to do what's right for him.

2013
01:37:54,235 --> 01:37:56,870
我毫不后悔我做过的事
I ain't sorry for nothing I done.

2014
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:01,107
我内心感到那是对的事
It felt right in my heart.

2015
01:38:03,177 --> 01:38:05,144
小宝宝在笑什么?
What you smiling at?

2016
01:38:09,216 --> 01:38:12,018
你父亲是个年纪老迈的好人
Your daddy's a great, big ol' man.

2017
01:38:13,988 --> 01:38:19,325
无所畏惧, 但有时候也难免会害怕
Got these great big ol' hands, but sometimes he's scared.

2018
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:23,496
而现在你父亲正正在害怕
And right now, your daddy's scared 'cause we

2019
01:38:24,131 --> 01:38:27,100
因为我们只能在这门廊坐着, 无家可归
sitting out here on the porch and ain't got no home.

2020
01:38:28,167 --> 01:38:29,168
我也试过居无定所
Oh, I've been homeless before.

2021
01:38:29,169 --> 01:38:34,240
但我没试过带着婴儿无家可归
I ain't never had no baby with me, but I've been homeless.

2022
01:38:35,643 --> 01:38:39,045
就只是寂寞的在外面流连
You just be out there on the road by your lonesome

2023
01:38:41,015 --> 01:38:42,949
看着列车一架一架
and just see one of them trains coming by

2024
01:38:42,951 --> 01:38:45,979
来了又走...
and just kinda go, say...

2025
01:39:15,149 --> 01:39:17,317
她是我的女儿, Rose, 是我的...
She's my daughter, Rose, and my...

2026
01:39:19,153 --> 01:39:23,022
我的亲生骨肉, 我不能遗弃她
My own flesh and blood. I can't deny her.

2027
01:39:23,024 --> 01:39:26,225
就像我不能遗弃我的儿子们
No more than I can deny them boys.

2028
01:39:27,161 --> 01:39:29,429
你们几母子都是我的家人
You and them boys is my family.

2029
01:39:30,464 --> 01:39:35,501
你们, 还有这孩子就是我唯一拥有的, 所以...
You, them, and this child is all I got in this world, so...

2030
01:39:38,172 --> 01:39:40,340
我想我要说的是
I guess what I'm saying is,

2031
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:51,184
如果你能替我照顾她, 我会很感谢你
that I'd appreciate it if you was to help me take care of her.

2032
01:40:02,730 --> 01:40:04,297
好吧, Troy
Okay, Troy,

2033
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:08,101
你是对的
you're right.

2034
01:40:10,337 --> 01:40:12,572
我会替你照顾你的孩子
I'll take care of your baby for you.

2035
01:40:14,074 --> 01:40:16,042
因为如你所说
'Cause, like you say,

2036
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:20,013
她是无辜的
she innocent.

2037
01:40:21,348 --> 01:40:25,018
总不能把父亲的罪名降到孩子身上
You can't visit the sins of the father upon the child.

2038
01:40:27,521 --> 01:40:31,157
况且单亲孩子的日子会很艰难
Motherless child's got a hard time.

2039
01:40:52,813 --> 01:40:56,049
从今起, 这孩子有个母亲了
From right now, this child's got a mother.

2040
01:41:02,389 --> 01:41:04,590
但你是个寡夫
But you're a womanless man.

2041
01:42:14,628 --> 01:42:16,629
大家都避开我
I'm coming in, everybody going out.

2042
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:19,432
我得带这蛋糕到教堂的蛋糕义卖
I'm taking this cake down to the church for the bake sale.

2043
01:42:19,434 --> 01:42:21,667
Lyons刚来过看你, 想要还你的二十块
Lyons was by to see you. He stopped by to pay you your $20.

2044
01:42:21,669 --> 01:42:23,336
钱就在桌上
It's laying right here on the table.

2045
01:42:23,408 --> 01:42:24,408
拿着, 是我的工资
Well, here go this money.

2046
01:42:24,438 --> 01:42:26,372
放在桌上吧, Troy, 我晚点处理
Well, put it in there on the table, Troy. I'll get it.

2047
01:42:27,174 --> 01:42:28,207
你什么时候回来?
What time you coming back?

2048
01:42:28,209 --> 01:42:29,746
你在这里问东问西也没用
Ain't no use in you studyin' me.

2049
01:42:29,776 --> 01:42:31,314
我何时回来也没关系
Don't matter what time I come back.

2050
01:42:31,344 --> 01:42:32,545
我只是问一下而已, 女人, 现在都不给问了吗?
I just asked you a question, woman. Can't I ask you a question?

2051
01:42:32,547 --> 01:42:33,646
Troy, 我不想吵架
Troy, I don't want to get into it.

2052
01:42:33,648 --> 01:42:35,314
你的餐在炉子里
Now, your food is in there on the stove.

2053
01:42:35,386 --> 01:42:36,486
翻热一下就好了
All you got to do is heat it up.

2054
01:42:36,516 --> 01:42:39,352
还有别吃掉蛋糕
And don't be eating the rest of them cakes in there now.

2055
01:42:39,424 --> 01:42:40,524
我还得用
I'm coming back for them.

2056
01:42:40,554 --> 01:42:42,722
明天下午也有蛋糕义卖
We're having a bake sale at the church tomorrow.

2057
01:42:57,554 --> 01:42:58,722
[工资]

2058
01:43:40,514 --> 01:43:41,681
嗨, Troy
Hey, Troy.

2059
01:43:41,982 --> 01:43:43,549
怎了, Bono?
What's happening, Bono?

2060
01:43:43,551 --> 01:43:46,452
只是想来看看你
I just thought I'd stop by to see you.

2061
01:43:46,454 --> 01:43:48,321
你家里没人, 所以我猜...
Wasn't no one at the house, so I figured...

2062
01:43:48,423 --> 01:43:50,122
为什么?
What you stop by to see me for?

2063
01:43:50,124 --> 01:43:52,525
你很久没来看我了
You ain't stopped by in a month of Sundays.

2064
01:43:52,527 --> 01:43:54,460
天啊, 我肯定欠了你钱还是什么的
Hell, I must owe you some money or somethin'.

2065
01:43:54,462 --> 01:43:57,997
你还说, 自从你升职后我都快跟不上你了
Well, since you got your promotion, I can't keep up with you.

2066
01:43:57,999 --> 01:43:59,599
以前早晚都看到你
Used to see you every day.

2067
01:43:59,601 --> 01:44:02,368
现在我甚至不知道你在哪工作
Now I don't even know what route you working.

2068
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:03,540
他们老是调配我到不同地方工作
Keep switching me around.

2069
01:44:03,570 --> 01:44:07,707
现在我负责白人的街区
Got me out there in green tree now, hauling white folk garbage.

2070
01:44:07,709 --> 01:44:09,575
- 白人街区吗?   - 对
- Green tree, huh?   - Yeah.

2071
01:44:09,647 --> 01:44:10,747
你真幸运
You lucky.

2072
01:44:10,777 --> 01:44:13,379
至少你不用搬垃圾
At least you ain't got to be lifting them barrels.

2073
01:44:13,381 --> 01:44:15,548
该死的, 它们越来越重
Damn if they ain't getting heavier.

2074
01:44:15,550 --> 01:44:18,317
我再多工作两年就退休了
I'm gonna put in my two years and call it quits.

2075
01:44:18,319 --> 01:44:20,386
对, 我也在想退休的事
Yeah, I'm thinking about retiring myself.

2076
01:44:20,721 --> 01:44:22,655
你的工作轻松多了
Oh, you got it easy.

2077
01:44:22,657 --> 01:44:26,626
你可以再多驾驶五年啊
You could drive for another five years.

2078
01:44:26,628 --> 01:44:27,793
那可不同, Bono
Ain't the same, Bono.

2079
01:44:28,295 --> 01:44:31,397
驾驶不像搬垃圾
It ain't like working the back of the truck.

2080
01:44:31,399 --> 01:44:35,401
只能独自工作, 没人聊天
You feel like you working by yourself. Ain't nobody to talk to.

2081
01:44:36,570 --> 01:44:39,472
不了, 还是退休吧, Lucille最近怎样?
Naw, I'm thinking about retiring. How's Lucille?

2082
01:44:39,672 --> 01:44:40,673
她很好
She all right.

2083
01:44:40,674 --> 01:44:43,743
她的关节炎有时候会复发
Her arthritis get to acting up on her sometimes.

2084
01:44:43,745 --> 01:44:47,413
我过来时看到Rose, 她在教堂吗?
Saw Rose on the way here. She going down to the church, huh?

2085
01:44:47,681 --> 01:44:49,482
对, 她过去了
Yeah, she took up going down there.

2086
01:44:49,484 --> 01:44:52,685
那些传教士只想捞油水而已
All them preachers looking to fatten their pockets.

2087
01:44:52,687 --> 01:44:55,354
这里有琴酒
Got some gin in here.

2088
01:44:55,356 --> 01:44:58,524
不了谢谢, 我只是来看看你
No, thanks. I just stopped in to say hello.

2089
01:44:58,526 --> 01:45:00,593
你也可以喝一杯啊朋友, 我从没...
Well, you can take a drink, nigger. I ain't...

2090
01:45:00,595 --> 01:45:03,029
认识你以来从没看过你不喝酒
I ain't never known you to say no to a drink.

2091
01:45:04,798 --> 01:45:06,032
你明天又不用上班
You ain't got to work tomorrow.

2092
01:45:06,034 --> 01:45:08,037
我只是来一下而已
I just stopped by.

2093
01:45:08,039 --> 01:45:10,067
我在想晚点到Skinner家里
I'm thinkin' of going over to Skinner's.

2094
01:45:10,069 --> 01:45:12,071
我们每星期五都会在他家里玩多米诺骨牌
We got us a domino game going over his house every Friday.

2095
01:45:12,073 --> 01:45:13,739
朋友, 你才不会玩什么多米诺骨牌
Nigger, you can't play no dominoes.

2096
01:45:13,741 --> 01:45:16,676
我以前老是赢你
I used to whup you four games out of five.

2097
01:45:17,044 --> 01:45:21,414
我吸取了教训, 我玩牌的技术在进步
Well, that learned me. I'm getting better.

2098
01:45:22,049 --> 01:45:23,316
是吗?
Yeah?

2099
01:45:30,057 --> 01:45:31,457
好吧
That's all right.

2100
01:45:33,627 --> 01:45:36,362
我得走了
Look here, I got to be getting on.

2101
01:45:36,364 --> 01:45:37,630
有空来找我一下?
Stop by sometime, huh?

2102
01:45:37,632 --> 01:45:39,732
我会的, Bono
Yeah, I'll do that, Bono.

2103
01:45:41,668 --> 01:45:46,572
Lucille跟Rose说你给她买了个新冰箱
Lucille told Rose you, uh, got her that new refrigerator.

2104
01:45:46,574 --> 01:45:51,077
对啊, Rose跟Lucille说你终于把籓篱建好了
Yeah. Rose told Lucille you had finally built your fence,

2105
01:45:51,079 --> 01:45:52,878
所以我想我们就扯平了
so, I figured we'd call it even.

2106
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:55,548
我就知道你信守承诺
I knew you would.

2107
01:45:55,550 --> 01:45:56,615
是啊
Yeah.

2108
01:45:58,685 --> 01:45:59,885
好了
Okay.

2109
01:46:01,355 --> 01:46:02,421
再见
I'll be talking to you.

2110
01:46:02,423 --> 01:46:05,091
很高兴看到你, Bono
Yeah, good to see you, Bono.

2111
01:46:05,093 --> 01:46:06,726
我有空会来找你的
I'm gonna stop over.

2112
01:46:06,728 --> 01:46:08,728
好吧, Troy
Yeah. Okay, Troy.

2113
01:46:52,228 --> 01:46:53,228
[美国海军陆战队招募署]

2114
01:47:35,782 --> 01:47:38,217
我要进去
I got to get by.

2115
01:47:38,219 --> 01:47:39,618
你说什么?
Say what? What you say?

2116
01:47:39,753 --> 01:47:42,021
你挡着我了, 我得进去
You in my way. I got to get by.

2117
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:47,760
你得去哪?
You got to get by where?

2118
01:47:49,529 --> 01:47:52,698
这是我付钱买的房子
This is my house. Bought and paid for.

2119
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:55,768
花了我15年之久, 如果你想进我的房子
Took me 15 years, and if you want to go in my house

2120
01:47:55,770 --> 01:47:57,736
而我坐在家门楼梯上的话, 你该说"请让一下"
and I'm sitting on the steps, you say, "excuse me,"

2121
01:47:57,738 --> 01:47:59,004
就像你妈妈教你那样
like your mama taught you.

2122
01:47:59,006 --> 01:47:59,939
得了吧, 爸, 我得进去
Come on, pop, I gotta get by.

2123
01:47:59,941 --> 01:48:01,240
你想就这样无视我?
You just gonna walk over the top of me?

2124
01:48:01,242 --> 01:48:02,975
我也在这里住的
I live here, too.

2125
01:48:02,977 --> 01:48:05,711
你想在我的地方无视我?
You just gonna walk over the top of me in my own house?

2126
01:48:05,713 --> 01:48:06,946
我不怕你
I ain't scared of you.

2127
01:48:07,247 --> 01:48:08,747
我没在问你是否害怕我
I ain't asked you if you was scared of me.

2128
01:48:08,749 --> 01:48:10,749
我是问你是否要在
I asked you was you finna walk over the top of me

2129
01:48:10,751 --> 01:48:12,485
我的地方无视我? 那才是我问的
in my own house? That was the question.

2130
01:48:12,487 --> 01:48:13,786
你不会说"请让一下"
You ain't gonna say, "excuse me."

2131
01:48:13,788 --> 01:48:14,954
你就这样无视我
You just gonna walk over the top of me.

2132
01:48:14,956 --> 01:48:16,088
随便你怎说
If you want to put it like that.

2133
01:48:16,090 --> 01:48:17,256
我怎说了?
How else am I gonna put it?

2134
01:48:17,258 --> 01:48:19,558
我是想绕过你进去
I was walking by you to go into the house,

2135
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:21,227
因为你醉了, 在楼梯上唱歌
'cause you sitting on the steps drunk, singing to yourself.

2136
01:48:21,229 --> 01:48:23,529
- 你也可以这样说   - 也不说"请让一下"?
- You can put it like that.   - Without saying, "excuse me"?

2137
01:48:28,568 --> 01:48:31,270
我问你了, 也不说"请让一下"?
I asked you a question. Without saying, "excuse me"?

2138
01:48:31,272 --> 01:48:32,671
我不用对你客气
I ain't got to say "excuse me" to you.

2139
01:48:32,673 --> 01:48:34,840
你在这个家里不重要了
You don't count around here no more.

2140
01:48:37,244 --> 01:48:38,944
我懂了, 我在这里不重要了
Oh, I see. I don't count around here no more.

2141
01:48:38,946 --> 01:48:40,713
你也不用跟你的父亲客气了
You ain't got to say "excuse me" to your daddy.

2142
01:48:40,715 --> 01:48:43,549
突然间, 你就可以作主
All of a sudden, you done got so grown,

2143
01:48:43,551 --> 01:48:45,985
认为你父亲在这里不重要对吧?
where your daddy don't count around here no more, huh?

2144
01:48:45,987 --> 01:48:47,753
在他辛劳工作才得以
Around here in his own house and yard

2145
01:48:47,755 --> 01:48:49,822
买回来的地方吗?
that he done paid for with the sweat of his brow?

2146
01:48:49,824 --> 01:48:52,658
突然间, 你就可以作主
All of a sudden, you done got so grown

2147
01:48:52,660 --> 01:48:54,126
认为你父亲在这里毫无地位
that your daddy don't even count around here.

2148
01:48:54,128 --> 01:48:55,728
你要成为一家之主吗?
What, you gonna take over?

2149
01:48:57,064 --> 01:49:00,065
你要接管我的屋子吗? 你要拿走我的东西吗?
You gonna take over my house? You gonna wear my pants?

2150
01:49:00,067 --> 01:49:02,101
你要睡在我的床上吗?
You gonna go in there and stretch out on my bed?

2151
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:05,704
你认为你不用再对你父亲客气
You ain't got to say, "excuse me,"

2152
01:49:05,706 --> 01:49:07,740
因为他在这里毫无地位
because your daddy don't count around here no more.

2153
01:49:07,742 --> 01:49:09,875
- 对吗?   - 正是
- Is that right?   - That's right.

2154
01:49:09,877 --> 01:49:11,610
你老是说这种蠢事
You always talking this dumb stuff.

2155
01:49:11,612 --> 01:49:12,745
为何不放过我一下?
Now why don't you just get out my way?

2156
01:49:12,747 --> 01:49:15,581
我猜你有自己的房子了
I guess you got some place to sleep.

2157
01:49:15,583 --> 01:49:19,685
也能够养活自己, 你能吗?
Something to put in your belly. You got that?

2158
01:49:21,088 --> 01:49:24,957
因为那就是你需要做到的, 你能吗?
'Cause that's what you need. You got that?

2159
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:28,694
你不知道我有什么能耐! 你也没有权利过问!
You don't know what I got! You ain't got to worry about what I got!

2160
01:49:28,895 --> 01:49:30,763
你说得对
You right.

2161
01:49:30,765 --> 01:49:32,565
完全正确
You 100% right.

2162
01:49:32,567 --> 01:49:36,101
十七年来我一直都照顾你, 担心你
I done spent the last 17 years worrying about what you got.

2163
01:49:36,103 --> 01:49:37,970
所以现在轮到你作主了吗?
Now, it's your turn, see?

2164
01:49:37,972 --> 01:49:40,105
我跟你说清楚现在的情况
I tell you what we do.

2165
01:49:41,641 --> 01:49:44,109
你长大了, 我们都知道吧
You grown. We done established that.

2166
01:49:44,644 --> 01:49:47,346
你说你是成人, 现在就看看你到底是不是
You a man. Now, let's see you act like one.

2167
01:49:47,348 --> 01:49:49,114
你现在转身离开这里
Turn your behind around and walk out this yard.

2168
01:49:49,116 --> 01:49:50,849
当你走出巷子时
And when you get out there in the alley,

2169
01:49:50,851 --> 01:49:52,351
你把这间屋子抛诸脑后
you can forget about this house, see.

2170
01:49:52,353 --> 01:49:53,819
因为这是我的房子
'Cause this is my house.

2171
01:49:53,821 --> 01:49:56,655
你出去, 成为你所谓的大人, 然后找个地方住
You go on and be a man and get your own house.

2172
01:49:56,657 --> 01:49:58,924
你可以把这一切忘掉, 因为这都是我的
You can forget about this, 'cause this is mine.

2173
01:49:58,926 --> 01:50:01,627
你出去过你的生活, 因为我已经不想再为你做什么了
You go on and get yours, 'cause I'm through doing for you.

2174
01:50:01,795 --> 01:50:03,762
还扯为我做的事, 你给过我什么?
What you done for me. What you ever give me?

2175
01:50:03,764 --> 01:50:07,099
你的身体, 那个还在跳动的心脏, 臭小子
Them feet. Them bones. That pumping heart, nigger!

2176
01:50:07,968 --> 01:50:10,035
我比任何人给过你的都多
Give you more than anybody else ever gonna give you.

2177
01:50:10,037 --> 01:50:12,371
你才没有给过我什么!
You ain't never gave me nothing!

2178
01:50:12,373 --> 01:50:14,006
你只会拖累我
You ain't never done nothing but hold me back,

2179
01:50:14,008 --> 01:50:16,675
害怕我会比你有成就!
afraid I was gonna be better than you!

2180
01:50:16,943 --> 01:50:20,112
你做过的所有只是想让我害怕你
All you ever did was try and make me scared of you.

2181
01:50:20,114 --> 01:50:22,147
以前你每一次叫我的时候, 我都在颤抖
I used to tremble every time you called my name.

2182
01:50:22,149 --> 01:50:25,017
每一次我在屋里听到你的脚步声也是
Every time I heard your footsteps in this house.

2183
01:50:25,019 --> 01:50:26,952
总是在想: 如果我这样做, 爸怎样反应?
Wondering all the time, "what's pop gonna say if I do this?

2184
01:50:27,024 --> 01:50:28,224
他又会怎样说?
"What's he gonna say if I do that?

2185
01:50:28,254 --> 01:50:30,356
如果我打开收音机他又会怎说?
"What's pop gonna say if I turn on the radio?"

2186
01:50:30,358 --> 01:50:32,878
妈妈也是! 她试着不去害怕你, 但终究也没用
And mom, too! She tries, but she's scared of you.

2187
01:50:32,908 --> 01:50:33,829
你妈妈与此无关, 她...
Leave your mama out of
this. Your mama ain't got...

2188
01:50:33,859 --> 01:50:35,960
真不懂为何你这样对她后, 她还能接受你
I don't know how she stands you after what you did to her!

2189
01:50:35,962 --> 01:50:37,395
我说过, 别把你妈妈混进这事
I told you, leave your mama outta this.

2190
01:50:37,397 --> 01:50:38,097
你要怎样做? 打我吗?
What are you gonna do? Give me a whupping?

2191
01:50:38,099 --> 01:50:40,132
你不能再打我了! 你太老了
You can't whup me no more! You're too old!

2192
01:50:40,134 --> 01:50:41,634
你只是个老头而已
You're just an old man.

2193
01:50:41,867 --> 01:50:42,868
臭小子!
Nigger!

2194
01:50:42,869 --> 01:50:44,937
你就是这样, 只是个...
That's what you are. You're just...

2195
01:50:46,973 --> 01:50:49,975
对我来说你只是个街上的流氓而已
You're just another nigger on the street to me.

2196
01:50:49,977 --> 01:50:51,043
你疯了! 你知道吗?
You're crazy! You know that?

2197
01:50:51,045 --> 01:50:52,411
对, 去吧
Yeah, go on.

2198
01:50:52,413 --> 01:50:54,847
就这样无视我, 你骨子里头是个恶人
Get on away from around me. You got the devil in you.

2199
01:50:54,849 --> 01:50:57,016
你只是个疯老头! 还说我是恶人
You are just a crazy old man! Talkin' about I got the "devil" in me!

2200
01:50:57,018 --> 01:50:58,117
对, 我疯了
Yeah. I am crazy.

2201
01:50:58,119 --> 01:51:00,085
如果你不滚出我的院子
If you don't get the hell out of my yard,

2202
01:51:00,087 --> 01:51:02,154
我会让你看看我有多疯
I'm gonna show you how crazy I am.

2203
01:51:02,156 --> 01:51:03,889
快滚出我的院子!
Now, go on, get the hell out of my yard!

2204
01:51:03,961 --> 01:51:04,961
这不是你的院子!
This ain't your yard!

2205
01:51:04,991 --> 01:51:06,859
你拿了Gabe叔叔打仗后的赔偿
You took Uncle Gabe's money he got from the army

2206
01:51:06,861 --> 01:51:08,394
去买这间房子, 然后赶走他了
to buy this house, when you put him out!

2207
01:51:08,396 --> 01:51:10,996
快滚出我的院子
Get your black ass out of my yard!

2208
01:51:10,998 --> 01:51:12,398
我哪都不去!
I ain't going nowhere!

2209
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:14,099
来啊, 赶走我啊, 我才不怕你
Come on, put me out, i ain't scared of you.

2210
01:51:16,002 --> 01:51:17,870
- 那是我的球棒   - 来啊
- That's my bat.   - Come on.

2211
01:51:17,872 --> 01:51:19,738
- 放下我的球棒   - 来啊, 赶走我!
- Put my bat down.   - Come on, put me out!

2212
01:51:20,707 --> 01:51:22,908
怎么了? 你要是那么棒, 赶走我啊!
What's the matter? You so bad. Put me out!

2213
01:51:23,076 --> 01:51:25,044
你要有用它的打算
You're gonna have to use it.

2214
01:51:26,913 --> 01:51:29,815
你敢对着我拿起球棒, 就要有用它的打算
You want to draw that bat back on me, you're gonna have to use it.

2215
01:51:29,817 --> 01:51:30,883
来啊!
Come on!

2216
01:51:31,951 --> 01:51:33,419
来啊!
Come on!

2217
01:51:33,421 --> 01:51:35,821
你要有打死我的打算
You're gonna have to kill me.

2218
01:51:35,823 --> 01:51:38,991
要是你敢对着我拿起球棒
You want to draw that bat back on me,

2219
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:41,960
你就要有打死我的打算
you're gonna have to kill me.

2220
01:51:43,430 --> 01:51:44,763
来啊
Come on.

2221
01:51:51,471 --> 01:51:54,840
你过来, 我教你
Come on. Then I'll show you.

2222
01:51:55,475 --> 01:51:56,809
来啊!
Come on!

2223
01:52:35,882 --> 01:52:38,016
走吧, 别再在我的房子出现
Go on, get away from around my house.

2224
01:52:47,794 --> 01:52:48,861
走啊
Go on.

2225
01:52:49,496 --> 01:52:51,497
跟妈妈说我会回来收拾细软
Tell mama I'll be back for my things.

2226
01:52:51,499 --> 01:52:54,366
你的东西会被扔出这藩篱外!
They'll be on the other side of that fence!

2227
01:53:06,846 --> 01:53:08,347
感受不到
Can't taste nothing.

2228
01:53:18,992 --> 01:53:21,160
我什么都感受不到
I can't taste nothing.

2229
01:53:24,097 --> 01:53:28,000
哈利路亚
Hallelujah!

2230
01:53:30,871 --> 01:53:32,271
哈利路亚
Hallelujah.

2231
01:53:42,882 --> 01:53:44,216
哈利路亚
Hallelujah.

2232
01:53:46,886 --> 01:53:49,188
我什么都感受不到了
I can't taste nothing no more.

2233
01:53:57,030 --> 01:53:58,297
来吧
Come on.

2234
01:53:59,232 --> 01:54:01,366
你和我作个了断吧
It's between you and me now.

2235
01:54:02,902 --> 01:54:06,405
来吧, 随时都行
Come on. Anytime you want.

2236
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:11,109
来吧, 我准备好了
Come on. I be ready for you.

2237
01:54:12,879 --> 01:54:15,414
但你别想能全身而退
But I ain't gonna be easy.

2238
01:54:27,926 --> 01:54:28,927
Raynell?
Raynell?

2239
01:54:28,928 --> 01:54:31,096
- 夫人?   - 你在做什么?
- Ma'am?   - What you doing?

2240
01:54:31,168 --> 01:54:32,168
没什么
Nothing.

2241
01:54:32,198 --> 01:54:35,000
进来换衣服吧, 你在做什么?
Get in here and get dressed. What are you doing?

2242
01:54:35,002 --> 01:54:36,935
看看它们有没有长大
See if my garden growed.

2243
01:54:36,937 --> 01:54:38,270
我说过它们不会一晚就长大
I told you it ain't gonna grow overnight.

2244
01:54:38,272 --> 01:54:39,438
你得耐心点
You got to wait.

2245
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:42,407
对, 但那看起好像永远不会长大, 该死的!
Yeah, but it look like it ain't never gonna grow, mama. Dag!

2246
01:54:43,076 --> 01:54:45,611
我说过, 心急水不沸
I told you, a watched pot never boils.

2247
01:54:45,613 --> 01:54:47,383
那可不同, 妈妈
This ain't even no pot, mama.

2248
01:54:47,413 --> 01:54:48,184
进来换衣服
Get in here and get dressed.

2249
01:54:48,214 --> 01:54:50,215
这不是出外玩的时候, 听到了吗?
This ain't no morning to be playing around, you hear me?

2250
01:54:50,917 --> 01:54:52,184
明白, 夫人
Yes, ma'am.

2251
01:54:54,888 --> 01:54:56,989
再见, 小田园
Bye, garden.

2252
01:55:18,211 --> 01:55:21,446
你好, 你想必就是Raynell吧
Hi. I bet your name is Raynell.

2253
01:55:24,117 --> 01:55:25,384
你妈妈在家吗?
Is your mama home?

2254
01:55:27,120 --> 01:55:29,187
妈妈, 有个男人找你!
Mama, there's a man down here!

2255
01:55:30,023 --> 01:55:31,089
妈妈
Mama!

2256
01:55:31,424 --> 01:55:33,125
Cory?
Cory?

2257
01:55:35,261 --> 01:55:36,495
Cory.
Cory.

2258
01:55:37,330 --> 01:55:39,197
Cory, Cory!
Cory. Cory!

2259
01:55:39,432 --> 01:55:43,368
- 噢, 我主慈悲!   - Cory
- Oh! Lord have mercy!   - Cory.

2260
01:55:47,473 --> 01:55:49,107
你们看看谁来了
Lookee here, y'all.

2261
01:55:50,944 --> 01:55:53,178
看他啊
Aww, looka here.

2262
01:55:53,180 --> 01:55:56,014
都长大了
Done got all grown up.

2263
01:55:56,016 --> 01:55:57,449
别哭, 妈妈, 为何要哭呢?
Don't cry, mama. What you crying about?

2264
01:55:57,451 --> 01:56:00,185
只是因为你出现了
I'm just so glad you made it.

2265
01:56:00,187 --> 01:56:02,287
嗨, Lyons, 你最近怎了, Bono先生?
Hey, Lyons. How you doing, Mr. Bono?

2266
01:56:02,289 --> 01:56:04,356
看看你啊, 老兄
Look at you, man, look at you.

2267
01:56:04,358 --> 01:56:07,292
他看上去很威风凛凛吧, Rose? 都是下士了
Don't he look good, Rose? Got on them corporal stripes.

2268
01:56:07,294 --> 01:56:08,964
为何现在才来?
What took you so long?

2269
01:56:08,966 --> 01:56:09,994
你知道军队怎操作的吧, 妈妈
You know how the marines are, mama.

2270
01:56:09,996 --> 01:56:11,296
他们得把所有文件检查清楚
They got to get all their paperwork straight

2271
01:56:11,298 --> 01:56:12,698
才让你做任何事
before they let you do anything.

2272
01:56:12,700 --> 01:56:16,134
怎样都好, 我很高兴你赶来了, 他们让Lyons来
Well, I'm sure glad you made it. They let Lyons come.

2273
01:56:16,206 --> 01:56:17,306
你的叔叔Gabe还在医院内
Your Uncle Gabe's still in the hospital.

2274
01:56:17,336 --> 01:56:19,404
他们不知道该否让他出来
They don't know if they're gonna let him out or not.

2275
01:56:19,406 --> 01:56:21,106
我刚跟他们说过话
I talked to them a little while ago.

2276
01:56:21,108 --> 01:56:23,442
美国海军陆战队的下士
A corporal in the United States marines.

2277
01:56:23,444 --> 01:56:25,711
你爸爸早知道你是军人的材料
Your daddy knew you had it in you.

2278
01:56:25,713 --> 01:56:27,713
他以前总是这样告诉我
He used to tell me all the time.

2279
01:56:27,715 --> 01:56:29,715
他看上去很不错吧, Bono先生?
Hey, don't he look good, Mr. Bono?

2280
01:56:29,717 --> 01:56:33,385
对, 他让我记起我第一次见到的Troy
Yeah, he reminds me of Troy when I first met him.

2281
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:36,054
我说, Rose
Ah, say, Rose,

2282
01:56:36,056 --> 01:56:38,323
Lucille现在在教堂和唱诗班一起
Lucille's down at the church with the choir.

2283
01:56:38,325 --> 01:56:40,325
我先去跟那些护柩者说一下
I'm gonna go get the pallbearers lined up.

2284
01:56:40,327 --> 01:56:41,526
晚点回来
I'll be back to get you all.

2285
01:56:41,761 --> 01:56:43,195
谢谢, Jim
Thanks, Jim.

2286
01:56:43,197 --> 01:56:44,262
晚点见, Bono先生
See you, Mr. Bono.

2287
01:56:48,234 --> 01:56:51,336
Cory, 看看Raynell
Cory, look at Raynell.

2288
01:56:51,338 --> 01:56:52,437
不是很美吗?
Ain't she precious?

2289
01:56:52,439 --> 01:56:54,106
她将来定是个大美人
She's gonna break a whole lot of hearts.

2290
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:55,774
跟你的哥哥打招呼, 这是你的哥哥Cory
Say hello to your brother. This your brother, Cory.

2291
01:56:55,776 --> 01:56:57,142
你记得Cory吗?
You remember Cory?

2292
01:56:57,144 --> 01:56:58,213
不记得, 夫人
No, ma'am.

2293
01:56:58,215 --> 01:57:00,243
她怎可能记得我, 妈妈
Naw, she don't remember me, mama.

2294
01:57:00,245 --> 01:57:02,147
我们有时候会说起你, 她也在的
Oh, well, we talk about you. She heard us talk about you.

2295
01:57:02,482 --> 01:57:05,217
这是你的哥哥Cory, 快打招呼
This is your brother, Cory. Say hello.

2296
01:57:05,219 --> 01:57:06,485
- 你好   - 你好
- Hi.   - Hi.

2297
01:57:06,487 --> 01:57:08,086
所以你就是Raynell吧
So, you're Raynell.

2298
01:57:08,088 --> 01:57:11,423
妈妈说了很多关于你的事给我
Mama's told me a lot about you.

2299
01:57:11,425 --> 01:57:13,759
让我煮点早餐给你吃, 别饿坏
Come on, let me fix you some breakfast. Keep up your strength.

2300
01:57:13,831 --> 01:57:14,931
我不饿, 妈妈
I ain't hungry, mama.

2301
01:57:14,961 --> 01:57:18,063
你可以煮点什么给我, 我待会进去找你
You can fix me something, Rose. I'll be in there in a minute.

2302
01:57:18,065 --> 01:57:19,364
你确定不吃点什么吗, Cory?
You sure you don't want nothing, Cory?

2303
01:57:19,366 --> 01:57:21,166
我知道他们没什么好吃的给你
I know they ain't feeding you right.

2304
01:57:21,168 --> 01:57:22,467
不了, 妈妈, 谢谢, 我现在不想吃
No, mama, thanks. I don't feel like eating.

2305
01:57:22,469 --> 01:57:23,568
晚点吧
I'll get something later.

2306
01:57:23,570 --> 01:57:27,539
Raynell, get up there and get
that dress on like I told you.

2307
01:57:38,818 --> 01:57:42,154
我早就知道你能成就大事
I always knew you was gonna make something out of yourself.

2308
01:57:43,556 --> 01:57:46,324
你永远朝着正确的方向走
Your head was always in the right direction.

2309
01:57:49,262 --> 01:57:50,362
所以
So,

2310
01:57:52,098 --> 01:57:53,598
你打算继续服役吗?
you gonna stay in?

2311
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:56,201
让它成为你的事业? 为军队付出20年?
Make it a career? Put in your 20 years?

2312
01:57:56,402 --> 01:58:00,205
我不知道, 已经服役六年了, 我想已经足够了
I don't know. I got six already. I think that's enough.

2313
01:58:00,207 --> 01:58:03,809
为美国效力然后早早退休
Stick with Uncle Sam and retire early.

2314
01:58:03,811 --> 01:58:05,610
这里没有什么
Ain't nothing out here.

2315
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:10,215
我想Rose跟你说过我发生什么事了吧
I guess Rose told you about what happened with me.

2316
01:58:12,485 --> 01:58:15,353
他们现在让我在囚犯工厂工作
They got me down at the workhouse.

2317
01:58:15,355 --> 01:58:18,223
我自以为偷偷的兑现他人支票很聪明
I thought I was being slick cashing other people's checks.

2318
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:21,293
被判多少年了?
How much time you doing?

2319
01:58:22,128 --> 01:58:24,496
三年
They give me three years.

2320
01:58:24,498 --> 01:58:27,666
我接受了, 现在只剩九个月
I got that beat now. I ain't got but nine more months.

2321
01:58:33,172 --> 01:58:35,507
那也不是件坏事
It ain't so bad.

2322
01:58:35,509 --> 01:58:38,543
你能学会如何面对它, 像面对其他事一样
You learn to deal with it like anything else.

2323
01:58:40,847 --> 01:58:42,848
人生不如意事十常八九
"You got to take the crookeds with the straights,"

2324
01:58:42,850 --> 01:58:46,251
那就是爸爸的座右铭
that's what papa used to say.

2325
01:58:46,253 --> 01:58:49,855
他以前被三振后老是这样说
He used to say that when he struck out.

2326
01:58:49,857 --> 01:58:52,224
我看见过他被连续三次三振
I seen him strike out three times in a row,

2327
01:58:52,226 --> 01:58:56,428
再上场时, 他把球打到看台上
and the next time up, he hit the ball over the grandstand.

2328
01:58:56,430 --> 01:58:59,464
在霍姆斯特德的棒球场上 [佛罗里达州]
Right out there in Homestead field.

2329
01:59:00,166 --> 01:59:02,134
他打到看台上还不满意
He wasn't satisfied hitting in the seats.

2330
01:59:02,136 --> 01:59:04,136
他想打出球场外
He wanted to hit it over everything.

2331
01:59:05,371 --> 01:59:07,239
比赛完结后
Then after the game,

2332
01:59:08,541 --> 01:59:13,278
有200位观众等着与他握手
he had 200 people standing around, waiting to shake his hand.

2333
01:59:16,482 --> 01:59:19,284
人生不如意事十常八九
You got to take the crookeds with the straights.

2334
01:59:22,655 --> 01:59:24,556
他真与众不同
Papa was something else.

2335
01:59:25,658 --> 01:59:27,926
你还在玩音乐吗?
You still playing?

2336
01:59:27,928 --> 01:59:29,628
Cory, 你知道我不会放弃音乐的
Cory, you know I'm gonna do that.

2337
01:59:30,496 --> 01:59:32,898
我跟那里几个志同道合的人, 组成了乐队
We got some fellas down there. We got us a band.

2338
01:59:32,900 --> 01:59:35,934
出狱后我们打算继续一起表演, 但...
We gonna try to stay together when we get out, but...

2339
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:37,269
对
Yeah.

2340
01:59:38,504 --> 01:59:40,639
我还在玩音乐
I'm still playing.

2341
01:59:41,307 --> 01:59:42,707
它仍然是我有动力活下去的原因
Still helps me get out of bed in the morning.

2342
01:59:42,779 --> 01:59:43,879
只要它一天是
As long as it do that,

2343
01:59:43,909 --> 01:59:47,579
我就不会放弃它, 更认真对待它
I'm gonna stick with it, try to make some sense out of it.

2344
01:59:47,581 --> 01:59:50,315
Lyons, 我煮了蛋给你
Lyons, I got these eggs in a pan.

2345
01:59:52,419 --> 01:59:54,586
让我进去吃点什么, 老兄
Let me get in here and get these eggs, man.

2346
01:59:54,588 --> 01:59:56,655
然后准备让爸爸入土
Get ready to go bury papa.

2347
02:00:02,595 --> 02:00:04,229
你过得怎样了?
How you doing?

2348
02:00:05,598 --> 02:00:07,299
你还好吗?
You doing all right?

2349
02:00:24,951 --> 02:00:27,686
你好
Hi.

2350
02:00:28,621 --> 02:00:30,355
你以前睡在我的房间吗?
You used to sleep in my room?

2351
02:00:31,490 --> 02:00:33,558
对, 那以前是我的房间
Yeah, that used to be my room.

2352
02:00:33,993 --> 02:00:37,229
那就是爸爸说的, Cory的房间
That's what papa callit. "Cory's room."

2353
02:00:39,365 --> 02:00:41,433
你的美式足球还在柜里
Got your football in the closet.

2354
02:00:41,435 --> 02:00:44,536
Raynell, 快换衣服, 也穿上新的鞋子
Raynell. Get up there, get dressed, and put them good shoes on.

2355
02:00:44,538 --> 02:00:46,738
妈妈, 我就不能穿这双吗? 那双新鞋子弄痛我的脚
Mama, can I just wear these? Them others hurt my feet!

2356
02:00:46,740 --> 02:00:49,007
那也只会弄痛一会儿而已
Well, they're just gonna have to hurt your feet for a while.

2357
02:00:49,009 --> 02:00:49,975
你买的时候
You ain't said they hurt your feet

2358
02:00:49,977 --> 02:00:51,443
也没说它们会弄痛你
when you went down to the store and got 'em.

2359
02:00:51,445 --> 02:00:53,578
那时候不痛, 现在我的双脚都长大了
They didn't hurt then. My feet done got bigger.

2360
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:55,380
别给我顶嘴!
Don't give me no back talk!

2361
02:00:55,382 --> 02:00:58,350
快换衣服, 穿上新鞋子
Get up there, get dressed, and put them good shoes on.

2362
02:02:05,718 --> 02:02:08,653
这里没什么大改变
Ain't too much changed.

2363
02:02:08,655 --> 02:02:11,523
那棒球还吊在树上
He still got that rag tied to the tree.

2364
02:02:14,627 --> 02:02:16,695
他当时在这里挥棒
He was out here swinging that bat.

2365
02:02:18,364 --> 02:02:21,333
我刚想回去屋子内
I was just getting ready to go back in the house.

2366
02:02:22,401 --> 02:02:25,337
他一挥, 然后整个人就倒下了
He swung that bat and just fell over.

2367
02:02:27,573 --> 02:02:31,543
当他挥棒时, 他看起来好像在笑
Seem like, when he swung it, he stood there with this grin on his face.

2368
02:02:37,416 --> 02:02:38,917
下一秒就倒下了
Then he just fell over.

2369
02:02:41,754 --> 02:02:43,555
他们来把他送到医院
They carried him down there to the hospital,

2370
02:02:43,557 --> 02:02:45,657
但我知道已经没有需要了
but I knew there wasn't no need.

2371
02:02:48,126 --> 02:02:49,127
不如跟我进去再说?
Why don't you come on in the house?

2372
02:02:49,128 --> 02:02:51,763
妈妈, 我有点事要告诉你
Mama, I got something to tell you.

2373
02:02:53,099 --> 02:02:56,434
我不知道该怎开口, 但我得告诉你
I don't know how to tell you this, but I got to tell you.

2374
02:02:56,436 --> 02:02:58,503
我不会出席爸爸的葬礼
I'm not going to papa's funeral.

2375
02:03:00,706 --> 02:03:04,609
小子, 闭嘴
Boy, hush your mouth.

2376
02:03:04,611 --> 02:03:06,778
那是你的爸爸!
That's your daddy you talking about!

2377
02:03:06,780 --> 02:03:08,847
我不想在这种时候听到你说这个
I don't want to hear that kind of talk this morning.

2378
02:03:08,849 --> 02:03:10,485
我这么辛苦把你养成这样的吗?
I done raised you to come to this?

2379
02:03:10,487 --> 02:03:12,215
你健健康康的
You standing there all healthy and grown,

2380
02:03:12,217 --> 02:03:13,685
怎么说你不出席爸爸的葬礼了?
talking about you ain't going to your daddy's funeral?

2381
02:03:13,687 --> 02:03:15,854
- 妈妈, 听着   - 我不想听, Cory!
- Mama, listen... - I don't want to hear it, Cory!

2382
02:03:15,926 --> 02:03:17,126
别再改样想了
Just get that thought out of your head.

2383
02:03:17,156 --> 02:03:19,924
我得向他说不, 就一次, 我得说不
I've got to say no to him. One time in my life, I got to say no.

2384
02:03:19,926 --> 02:03:21,693
我不想听这些!
I don't got to listen to that!

2385
02:03:21,695 --> 02:03:23,461
我知道你和你爸爸不和
Now, I know you and your daddy ain't seen eye to eye,

2386
02:03:23,463 --> 02:03:26,798
但我不想在这种时候听到你说出这种话
but I don't have to listen to that kind of talk this morning.

2387
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:29,601
不尊重父亲不是作为一个男人该做的事, Cory
Disrespecting your daddy ain't gonna make you a man, Cory.

2388
02:03:29,603 --> 02:03:31,469
你得找个方法让自己接受
You gotta find some way to come to that on your own.

2389
02:03:31,471 --> 02:03:33,838
不出席你爸爸的葬礼不会让你成人的
Not going to your daddy's funeral ain't gonna make you a man.

2390
02:03:36,809 --> 02:03:39,811
我以前在这里的日子
The whole time I was growing up, living in his house,

2391
02:03:39,813 --> 02:03:42,814
爸爸就像一道永远跟着你的黑影
papa was like a shadow that followed you everywhere.

2392
02:03:43,616 --> 02:03:46,818
它就像个重担, 它会侵蚀到你体内
It weighed on you, and it sunk into your flesh.

2393
02:03:47,553 --> 02:03:49,587
它会把你紧紧的包着, 不让你走
It would wrap around you and lay there

2394
02:03:49,589 --> 02:03:51,923
直到你分不清哪个才是真正的自己
until you couldn't tell which one was you anymore.

2395
02:03:51,925 --> 02:03:56,461
那黑影就一点点的侵蚀到你皮下
That shadow just diggin' into your flesh!

2396
02:03:56,463 --> 02:03:58,730
试着占据你的心, 然后控制你
Trying to crawl in. Trying to live through you.

2397
02:03:59,632 --> 02:04:04,469
哪里都是Troy Maxson的踪影
Everywhere I looked, I saw Troy Maxson staring right back at me.

2398
02:04:04,471 --> 02:04:07,639
在你床下, 又或是在衣柜内
Hiding under the bed, in the closet.

2399
02:04:07,641 --> 02:04:09,174
我只是想说我得找个方法
I'm just saying I got to find a way

2400
02:04:09,176 --> 02:04:10,675
去摆脱那个黑影, 妈妈
to get rid of that shadow, mama.

2401
02:04:10,677 --> 02:04:12,911
你就像他, 他早已占据你的心了
You just like him. You got him in you good.

2402
02:04:12,913 --> 02:04:14,212
别说我是他, 妈妈
Don't tell me that, mama.

2403
02:04:14,214 --> 02:04:15,513
你简直就是Troy Maxson
You Troy Maxson all over again.

2404
02:04:15,515 --> 02:04:17,916
我不想成为Troy Maxson!
I don't want to be Troy Maxson!

2405
02:04:19,218 --> 02:04:20,852
我只想做我自己
I just want to be me.

2406
02:04:20,854 --> 02:04:23,855
你永远都会是你自己啊, Cory
You can't be nobody but who you are, Cory.

2407
02:04:23,857 --> 02:04:27,192
那黑影只不过是你自己制造出来的
That shadow wasn't nothing but you growing into yourself.

2408
02:04:27,194 --> 02:04:29,194
你要么早晚成为它, 要么就只接受它的部份
You either got to grow into it, or cut it down to fit you,

2409
02:04:29,196 --> 02:04:31,663
但你要生活就得这样做
but that's all you got to make a life with.

2410
02:04:31,665 --> 02:04:35,733
那就是唯一你要跟外面的人比较的东西
That's all you got to measure yourself against the world out there.

2411
02:04:36,669 --> 02:04:39,671
你爸爸想你成为和他完全不一样的人
Your daddy wanted you to be everything he wasn't,

2412
02:04:39,673 --> 02:04:41,206
同时间
and at the same time,

2413
02:04:41,208 --> 02:04:43,942
他也想你成为他啊
he wanted you to be everything he was.

2414
02:04:44,243 --> 02:04:45,944
我不评论他是对还是错
Now, I don't know if he was right or wrong,

2415
02:04:45,946 --> 02:04:47,245
但我知道
but I do know

2416
02:04:47,247 --> 02:04:50,515
他本意是想做好事而非伤害你
he meant to do more good than he meant to do harm.

2417
02:04:52,251 --> 02:04:55,053
有时候他想碰触他人, 自己也会受伤
Sometimes, when he touched, he bruised,

2418
02:04:55,821 --> 02:04:59,090
有时候他想做好事, 却成了坏事
and sometimes, when he took me in his arms, he cut.

2419
02:05:05,898 --> 02:05:08,066
我最初遇见你爸爸时
When I first met your daddy,

2420
02:05:08,968 --> 02:05:10,735
我在想
I thought,

2421
02:05:10,737 --> 02:05:13,872
那是个我可以付托终身的人
"here is a man I can lay down with and make a baby."

2422
02:05:17,543 --> 02:05:20,545
那就是我对他的第一个想法
That's the first thing I thought when I seen him.

2423
02:05:20,547 --> 02:05:22,814
我当时想: Rose Lee
I thought, "Rose Lee,

2424
02:05:23,549 --> 02:05:25,683
那是个你可以真诚相对的人
"here's a man you can open yourself up to

2425
02:05:25,685 --> 02:05:27,852
然后被他的爱填得满满的
"and be filled to bursting!

2426
02:05:29,288 --> 02:05:34,025
那是个可以把你心里空白的位置
"Here's a man that can fill up all them empty spaces

2427
02:05:34,027 --> 02:05:36,861
全都补上的人
"you been tipping around the edges of."

2428
02:05:42,001 --> 02:05:45,036
当你爸爸进门时
When your daddy walked through the house,

2429
02:05:45,038 --> 02:05:46,905
他是...
he was just

2430
02:05:47,940 --> 02:05:50,575
那么的大啊 [形容他独力承担起家庭]
so big.

2431
02:05:52,011 --> 02:05:53,845
他心里全都占满了 [工作]
He filled it up!

2432
02:05:56,282 --> 02:05:59,050
那是我犯下的第一个错误
That was my first mistake.

2433
02:05:59,052 --> 02:06:01,686
没让他在心里留点位置给我
Not to make him leave some room for me.

2434
02:06:01,954 --> 02:06:03,888
但
But

2435
02:06:06,025 --> 02:06:08,760
我想要个快乐的家
I wanted a house I could sing in.

2436
02:06:09,962 --> 02:06:13,331
你爸爸也给我了
And that's what your daddy gave me.

2437
02:06:13,333 --> 02:06:14,966
我不知道该怎样跟上他的步伐
I didn't know to keep up his strength,

2438
02:06:14,968 --> 02:06:17,669
我得牺牲自己
I had to give up little pieces of mine.

2439
02:06:19,305 --> 02:06:22,774
我把他的生活当做是我的生活
I took on his life as mine and mixed up the pieces,

2440
02:06:22,776 --> 02:06:25,843
以致难以分辨到底那是我的, 还是他的生活 [成全他]
so you couldn't hardly tell which was which.

2441
02:06:28,647 --> 02:06:31,816
那是我的选择, 放弃我的人生
It was my choice. My life.

2442
02:06:31,818 --> 02:06:34,886
而我根本不用那样屈就自己啊
And I didn't have to live it like that,

2443
02:06:36,889 --> 02:06:38,957
但那是我作为女人得做的
but that's what life offered me in the way of being a woman,

2444
02:06:38,959 --> 02:06:40,158
而我也接受了
and I took it.

2445
02:06:42,361 --> 02:06:45,330
我全然接受了
I grabbed it with both hands.

2446
02:06:45,332 --> 02:06:48,633
当Raynell来到我们家里时
And by the time Raynell came into the house...

2447
02:06:53,372 --> 02:06:57,875
我不想从别人的不幸上得到快乐
I didn't want to make my blessings off of nobody's misfortune,

2448
02:06:59,678 --> 02:07:02,814
但我依然把Raynell当作
but I took on to Raynell like she was

2449
02:07:02,816 --> 02:07:05,984
我想要但却从没有过的孩子
all them babies I wanted and never had.

2450
02:07:08,087 --> 02:07:11,155
就像我可以取回我原本的人生, 即使那么一点也好
Like I'd been blessed to relive a part of my life.

2451
02:07:13,893 --> 02:07:17,662
如果上帝认为有需要的话
And if the lord see fit to keep up my strength,

2452
02:07:19,665 --> 02:07:23,735
我会像你爸爸对你那样对待她
I'm gonna do her exactly how your daddy did you.

2453
02:07:27,039 --> 02:07:29,941
我会把我最好的都给她
I'm gonna give her the best of what's in me.

2454
02:07:39,885 --> 02:07:40,985
妈妈!
Mama!

2455
02:07:40,987 --> 02:07:43,121
Tolliver牧师打来了
Reverend Tolliver on the phone.

2456
02:08:00,906 --> 02:08:01,973
你好
Hi.

2457
02:08:04,410 --> 02:08:05,677
你好
Hi.

2458
02:08:05,978 --> 02:08:08,146
你在军队还是陆战队?
You in the army or the marines?

2459
02:08:08,148 --> 02:08:09,814
陆战队
Marines.

2460
02:08:10,883 --> 02:08:14,085
爸爸说你在军队, 你认识Blue吗?
Papa said it was army. You know Blue?

2461
02:08:14,453 --> 02:08:15,953
Blue? 谁是Blue?
Blue? Who's blue?

2462
02:08:16,088 --> 02:08:18,222
爸爸以前养的狗, 说起他时总会唱起歌来
Papa's dog, what he sing about all the time.

2463
02:08:21,500 --> 02:08:23,222
Here, Ring. Yeah, Ring Here

2464
02:08:25,500 --> 02:08:27,822
I had an old dog whose name was Blue

2465
02:08:29,500 --> 02:08:30,522
You know that Blue was mighty true

2466
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:33,522
You know Blue was a good old dog

2467
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,222
Blue treed a 'possum in a hollow log

2468
02:08:38,500 --> 02:08:40,222
From that you know Blue's a good old dog

2469
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:42,222
Here, Ring. Yeah, Ring Here

2470
02:08:43,800 --> 02:08:45,222
Blue treed a 'possum out on a limb

2471
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:47,822
Blue looked at me and I looked at him

2472
02:08:49,200 --> 02:08:50,822
Grabbed that 'possum and put him in a sack

2473
02:08:51,900 --> 02:08:53,222
Do fer me, Blue, 'til I get back

2474
02:08:53,600 --> 02:08:55,822
Old Blue's feet was big and round

2475
02:08:56,200 --> 02:08:57,822
Never 'lowed a 'possum to tech the ground

2476
02:08:59,200 --> 02:09:00,522
Old Blue died and I dug his grave

2477
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:03,522
I dug his grave with a silver spade

2478
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:05,722
I let him down with a golden chain

2479
02:09:06,200 --> 02:09:08,122
And every link I called his name

2480
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:10,522
Go on Blue you good dog you

2481
02:09:10,777 --> 02:09:11,809
一起唱
Come on.

2482
02:09:12,477 --> 02:09:13,809
Go on Blue you good dog you

2483
02:09:14,477 --> 02:09:16,109
Blue laid down and died like a man

2484
02:09:17,477 --> 02:09:19,009
Blue laid down and died...

2485
02:09:20,577 --> 02:09:23,509
Blue laid down and died like a man

2486
02:09:25,477 --> 02:09:27,109
Now he's treein' 'possums in the promised land

2487
02:09:29,077 --> 02:09:31,009
I'm goin' to tell you this jes' to let you know

2488
02:09:32,077 --> 02:09:34,009
Old Blue's gone where the good dogs go

2489
02:09:42,541 --> 02:09:45,076
Cory, 我们得准备起行了
Cory, we're getting ready to leave now!

2490
02:09:52,084 --> 02:09:55,086
听妈妈的话, 上去换好鞋子
Go upstairs and put your shoes on like mama told you,

2491
02:09:55,088 --> 02:09:58,055
然后去爸爸的葬礼
so we can get ready to go to papa's funeral.

2492
02:09:58,991 --> 02:10:01,159
好的, 一会见
Okay. I'll be back.

2493
02:10:11,570 --> 02:10:12,837

- How you doing, Uncle Gabe? - How you doing, Uncle Gabe?

2502
02:10:35,894 --> 02:10:39,230
