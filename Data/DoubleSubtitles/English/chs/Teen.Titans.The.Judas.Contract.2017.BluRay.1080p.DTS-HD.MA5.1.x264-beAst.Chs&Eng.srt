五年前

00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,590
你就不能开快点吗
Speed it up, will you?

5
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:25,920
你开车跟老太婆一样
You drive like my granny.

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,560
在一堆车子中 我有什么办法
We're moving with the flow of traffic.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,920
什么时候轮我开
When do I get to drive?

8
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,090
我的车 所以 不
My car, so, never.

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,130
我在创建一个推特账户
Ooh, I'm gonna sign in this thing called Twitter.

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,930
就像你可以吧我喜欢吃披萨发出去
You put up what you're thinking like, I love pizza,

11
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,800
或者 我正在吃披萨 甚至是 披萨太棒了
or I'm having pizza now, or even pizza is awesome.

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,670
你们每天脑子里不会只有披萨吧
All your thoughts don't have to be pizza related.

13
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,810
谁说的
Says who?

14
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,040
嘿 我们可以在这时
Hey, I could order a pizza,

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,080
定一个披萨
while we're puttering along here.

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,380
噢 好主意
Ooh, great idea.

17
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,510
马上就能吃上披萨咯
Gonna have pizza soon.

18
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,780
已推送
First twit sent.

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,350
那是什么玩意
What the heck is that?

20
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,690
- 闪电侠 去看下  - 收到
- Flash, go find out.  - On it.

21
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,190
- 报告  - 你需要自己来看
- Report.  - You need to see for yourself.

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,690
我没法完全确定
I'm not totally sure.

23
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,180
终于有事做了 我们先阻止那恐怖五人组
Big week for us. First, we stop the fearsome five.

24
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,280
他们一定会这么说
They were so pissed.

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,250
你们要为此付出付出代价
You'll pay for interfering with us.

26
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,490
什么什么的
Blah, blah, blah.

27
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,890
先做正事
And now we get to stop an alien brawl.

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,160
我们该站哪一边
Which side do we join?

29
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,700
- 不是吧  - 不能以貌取人
- Really?  - Looks can be deceiving.

30
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,040
少年泰坦 出击
Titans, go!

31
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,710
这个决定可与她很性感没一点关系
And the fact that she's hot has nothing to do with it.

32
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,050
闪开 蜥蜴唇
Buzz off, lizard lips!

33
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,160
借过 抱歉
Coming through. Excuse me.

34

抱歉[法语]
Excusez-moi

35
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,990
我想长发公主想告诉我们些什么
I think Rapunzel is trying to tell us something.

36
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,490
快手 你有足够大的家伙能把那玩意关上吗
Speedy, you got something loud to close that thing?

37
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,790
没问题 老大
Got you covered, boss.

38
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,240
这我可没料到
I did not see that coming.

39
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,480
谢谢你
Thank you.

40
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,020
我是来自塔马兰的柯莉安妲
I am Koriand'r of Tamaran.

41
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,850
我们一族人可以通过亲吻习得对方的语言
Our kind can learn language from the act of kissing.

42
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,120
不错
Useful.

43
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,760
你还好吗
Are you all right?

44
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,600
我的姐妹 柯曼得 篡权了王位
My sister, Komand'r, staged a coup and took the throne.

45
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,940
我不得不逃走
I had to flee.

46
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,170
但我很快就会回去
But I will soon return.

47
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,470
好吧 你可以跟我们呆在一起 直到你想出解决办法来
Well, you can stay with us until you figure it out.

48
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,840
好吗
Okay?

49
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,040
好的 请麻烦你
Yes, please.

50
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,610
我寻求两到三天的庇护
I will ask sanctuary for two or three days.

51
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,150
最长一周

52
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,020
让我来为你介绍我的朋友们
Let me introduce you to my friends.

53
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,820
哦对了 我能说点西班牙语
Oh, by the way, I speak some Spanish,

54
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,020
倘若你想学的话…
if you wanna learn that.

55
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,630
还有法语
Second year high school French.

56
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,000
欢迎来到少年泰坦

57
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,600

少年泰坦：犹大契约

59
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,700
现在

60
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,350
小心点你个蠢货
Careful, you fool.

61
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,090
这设备比你的命都值钱
This equipment is worth more than your lives.

62
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,860
什么
What?

63
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,360
少年泰坦在不到一分钟的时间里就会找过来
The Titans will be there in less than a minute.

64
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,400
我怎么没看出来
I see no signs of that.

65
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,300
信 或者不信 你的选择
Believe, don't believe, your choice.

66
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,990
他们有防备
They're ready.

67
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,460
可惜太慢了
They're slow.

68
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,460
我还没有回贴
I hardly had time to answer a post.

69
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,000
爬上去太明显了 而且还有月光
It's a tough climb, especially in this moonlight.

70
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,040
夜翼
Nightwing.

71
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,300
它们会发现我们的
They're bound to spot us.

72
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,140
夜翼
Nightwing.

73
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,470
如果我们等那些云
If we wait for those clouds...

74
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,540
迪克
Dick!

75
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,610
干嘛
What?

76
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,380
土石女会把我们带上去的
Terra is taking us up there.

77
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,540
是吗
She is?

78
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,150
是 这儿所有脏活都是我的
Yeah, I do all the dirty work around here.

79
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,690
往上
Going up.

80
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,030
你离开太久了 牛仔
You've been gone a long time, cowboy.

81
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,000
行动
Let's move.

82
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,780
安静
Quiet down.

83
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,010
圣甲虫在害怕
The bug is nervous.

84
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,150
我也没多少信心
I'm not feeling too good about this myself.

85
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,350
你怎么能这么冷静
How come you're so calm?

86
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,290
因为你从没当过地鼠
You have never been a gopher.

87
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,660
圣甲虫 停下来
Scarab, stop.

88
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,790
你最好控制住那东西 甲壳虫
Control that thing, Beetle,

89
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,600
要么我就替你动手了
or I'll control it for you.

90
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,260
你打算在这地方舞刀弄枪
You're going to have a sword fight in here?

91
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,200
要不给你换个更像样点的地方  比如扫帚间
How about some place roomier like a broom closet?

92
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,840
所有人 冷静下来
Everyone, calm down.

93
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,270
敌人就在我们上面
The enemy is above us.

94
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,140
任务是一切
You have to channel all your thoughts to that.

95
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,670
记住 这些不是一般的敌人
Remember, these opponents are different.

96
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,710
呃 就像柯莉告诉你们的那样
Uh, as Kori will tell you.

97
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,540
不不 没关系请继续讲
No, keep going.

98
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,810
自从我离开泰坦 我一直在研究这些敌人
I've been studying them since I left the Titans.

99
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
他们是极端狂热份子
They're zealots, extremists.

100
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,650
为了打倒你 他们可以不眨眼睛就牺牲掉自己
They'll sacrifice themselves without hesitation to get to you.

101
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,020
所以 我们得尽快打败他们 越快越好
So, the quicker we take them down, the better.

102
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,120
这样差不多了
That about cover it?

103
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,190
讲的非常好
Very well said.

104
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,190
土石女 你还能坚持住吗
Terra, can you do this?

105
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,100
当然 倘若你们都闭嘴的话
Yes, if you'd all shut up.

106
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,010
现在距离地板只有六英尺
We're six inches under the floor.

107
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,240
谁想敲敲门
Who wants to knock?

108
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,190
泰坦 出击
Titans, go!

109
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,700
谢谢带我们潜入了这个压根没法潜入的蜂巢基地 土石女
Thanks for getting us into the impenetrable H.I.V.E base, Terra.

110
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,270
是啊 你是最棒的
Yeah, you're the best.

111
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,310
这个坏蛋是你的 老妈
This bad guy is yours, mama.

112
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,750
土石女 跟紧我们
Terra, stay with us.

113
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,420
说得好像我一没你们就不行了
Like I couldn't take out all these jokers by myself.

114
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,260
我们这里已经暴露了
We've been compromised.

115
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,830
遗弃基地
Abandon the base.

116
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,540
他们准备得还不错
They prepared well.

117
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,140
反应也迅速
Their reaction time is much better.

118
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,370
罗宾 别再恭维这些坏蛋了
Robin, stop complementing the bad guys.

119
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,710
至少有一点他说对了 时刻准备着
But he's right. Be ready for anything.

120
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,350
这些家伙的装备肯定是批发的
These dudes must buy their bad guy stuff in bulk.

121
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,850
要不我们试试你上周末教我的那个怎么样
How about we do that move you taught me last weekend?

122
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,420
在这地方
Now?

123
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,590
我无所谓 但他们就不知道了
I admire your boldness, but what will the team think?

124
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,730
等等 不是这意思
What? No, not...

125
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,930
好吧 我怕了你
Okay, you got me.

126
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,630
是说我们训练的那一招 请
The training move, please.

127
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,760
上卡车
Get in the truck.

128
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,440
你们的义务已尽
Your service has come to an end.

129
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,240
再见
Bless you all.

130
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,370
小心点 哥们儿 那些可是我的朋友
Watch it, dude. Those are my friends.

131
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,810
别搞得在像在管束你舍友一样 甲壳
At least act like you're trying to keep your parasite in line, Beetle.

132
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,320
胆子真小
That was unbearable.

133
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,550
你说呢
Get it?

134
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,320
无聊
Seriously?

135
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,100
你能别把自己暴露给敌人吗
Could you not leave yourself open like that?

136
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,400
我担心
I worry.

137
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,860
对不起宝贝
I'm sorry, babe.

138
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,370
我最近想了很多
I've been doing a lot of thinking lately.

139
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,700
关于什么的
About what?

140
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,850
我觉得我们的关系应该进展到下一步
I think we should take the next step in our relationship.

141
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,850
下次再说
To be continued.

142
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,730
说茄子
Say cheese,

143
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,530
发送
and post.

144
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,800
晚上一起看电影怎么样
Hey, how about a movie tonight?

145
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,470
继续走你的 马盖拉
Keep moving, Magilla.

146
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,410
基地是我们的了
The base is ours.

147
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,280
刚才我们被打断前 你打算说什么来着
So, what were you saying before we were interrupted?

148
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,050
我
I...

149
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,260
好吧 哪都一样
Okay, good a place as any.

150
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,030
我在城里有一所公寓
I got an apartment in the city.

151
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,970
也许我们能分享一下
I hoped, maybe, we could share, you know,

152
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,040
你知道 住一起
together.

153
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,300
哦 好吧
Oh, snap!

154
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,240
里面竟然不是一颗石头
No rock?

155
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,510
这可真够差劲的
That's so lame.

156
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,350
在塔玛拉 我们其实很随便的
On Tamaran, everyone would gossip.

157
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,080
所以我们可以住在一起
So it's a good thing we live here.

158
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,520
我觉得他们不太传统
What I'm getting is that they're too good to hang with us.

159
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,330
是吗 你在嫉妒吗
Yeah, that's the takeaway.

160
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,900
粉丝过百万了
Hey, I'm over a million followers!

161
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,130
我赢了
Call me Jefe.

162
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,560
你得把注意力放在游戏上
You need to get your head in the game, gar.

163
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,700
或者你的心思在另一种游戏上
Or, maybe your head is in a different game.

164
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,640
我这么棒 竟然没人约我
Who wouldn't want to date me? I'm awesome.

165
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,810
可我不管做什么 都没用
But everything I do pisses her off.

166
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,140
想听听我的建议
Want my advice?

167
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,710
别再变成猩猩然后去偷吻了
Quit turning into a chimp and stealing monkey kisses.

168
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,610
可人们觉得那样可爱啊
People think that's adorable.

169
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,550
不 没人那么想
Nope, no one thinks that.

170
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,920
好了
Time out.

171
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,650
我得去打通电话
Gotta make a call.

172
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,920
土石女
Terra.

173
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,590
陪我过几招
Would you like to join me?

174
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,520
这东西能帮我沉下心来
The staff helps clear the mind.

175
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,860
不 谢谢
No thanks.

176
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,390
我只想离那绿豆子远一点
I'm just trying to avoid green bean for a while.

177
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,960
我从来都不关心动物园发生了什么
I never cared much for the zoo.

178
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,100
如果他骚扰你…
If he's bothering you...

179
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,470
他只是个混蛋
He's just a jerk.

180
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,010
关于她的流言是真的吗
Is it true what they say about her,

181
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:42,040
她父亲被她困在了她额间的宝石里
that she has her father trapped in that Jewel on her head?

182
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,650
是的 他的名字叫鬼父
Yes, his name is Trigon.

183
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,220
他是一个恶魔
He's a demon.

184
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,550
他们之间有间隙
They have issues.

185
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,120
好吧 起码她知道去哪能找到她的父亲
Well, she knows where she can find him.

186
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,590
你该多和她谈谈
You should talk to her more.

187
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,620
你就会发现渡鸦非常
You'll find that Raven can be quite

188
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,930
有趣
interesting.

189
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,500
不 谢谢了 我有点怕她
No thanks. Too creepy for me.

190
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,040
米拉格罗 听起来不错
Sounds like a good time, Milagro.

191
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,670
你拿到我的礼物了吗
Did you get my gift?

192
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,080
当然 永远的十七岁的礼品卡 我的最爱
Sure did. Gift card to the seventeen forever. My favorite.

193
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,550
妈妈和爹地想跟你说话 爱你
Mom and dad wanna say hi. Love you.

194
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,420
瞧我的宝贝儿子
There's my baby boy!

195
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,090
你能吃饱饭吗
Are you getting enough to eat?

196
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,060
是啊 你过得怎么样
Yeah, how's it goin'?

197
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,660
还是不太喜欢我 哼
Still doesn't like me, huh?

198
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,060
他在改变
It's getting better.

199
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,430
别提那东西了
Let's not talk about that thing.

200
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,200
转眼两年过去了
It's been two years.

201
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,570
我正在努力 爸爸
I'm working on it, dad.

202
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,270
但这很难 你知道
But it's hard, you know.

203
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,570
他有自己的想法
It's got a mind of its own.

204
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,270
- 还有自己的脾气  - 奥多
- And a temper.  - Aldo.

205
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,980
他和一群超级英雄在一起
For god's sake. He's with a bunch of super heroes.

206
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,310
超人或是谁能把那东西弄下来
You think superman or someone could take that thing off him.

207
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,950
你应该冷静一点
You're supposed to calm down.

208
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,450
我们不能把每次通电话都这样结束
We can't have every call end this way, Aldo.

209
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,190
海梅不想我们讨论这个问题
Jaime won't wanna talk to us.

210
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,820
为什么是蛋糕
Why is the cake

211
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,120
出去吗 这不是时候
coming out? It's not time!

212
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,730
啊 你的姨妈 慷苏拉 简直神经了
Ah, your aunt, Consuela, esta loca.

213
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,030
去吧 妈妈 我们可以之后再聊
Go, mom, we can talk later.

214
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,800
我爱你 海梅
I love you, Jaime.

215
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,860
保重
Be good.

216
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,630
慷苏拉 把蛋糕给我
Consuela, give me that cake!

217
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,740
我最好也走了
I better go too.

218
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,740
真抱歉 只是
I'm sorry. It's just...

219
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,280
我想我的儿子
I miss my son.

220
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,630
正在打开最近的 血兄弟 片段
Accessing most recent footage on brother blood.

221
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,470
一派胡言
Lies.

222
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,240
我的教堂是神圣的地方
My church is a holy place

223
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,440
我们唯一的使命是做正确的事
and we strive only to do good.

224
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,140
拜托  血兄弟
Come now, brother blood.

225
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,580
你的教堂难道不是另一个光荣化的邪教吗
Isn't your church just a glorified cult?

226
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,480
不像你 布赖斯 我坚信着美国
Unlike you, Bryce, I believe in an America

227
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,880
所有信仰都应被给予应有的尊重
where all beliefs should be treated with respect.

228
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,020
可耻的事媒体认为并非如此
It's a shame the press doesn't.

229
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,790
恐怕这是我们能从血会得到的所有消息了
I'm afraid that's all we're going to get from brother blood.

230
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,260
我是彼得森 布赖斯
I'm Bryce Peterson.

231
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,030
晚安
-Have a good night.

232
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,900
祖父一定会为血兄弟
Grandfather would have been impressed with blood,

233
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,630
经营着像蜂巢一样一个世界范围的邪教而骄傲
running a worldwide cult as well as H.I.V.E.

234
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,030
他们本为一体
They're the same thing.

235
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,940
只是让他们看起来是分开的而已
He just makes them look separate.

236
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,510
你从来都不脱掉那制服吗
Do you ever get out of that uniform?

237
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,110
只有洗澡时候才脱
Only when I bathe.

238
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,180
也许是时候了
Might be time.

239
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,750
没味道
I'm good.

240
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,720
我出去了
Goin' out.

241
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,350
我听说你总是出去
I hear you're gone a lot.

242
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,120
你去哪
Where do you go?

243
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,890
你知道我是不需要大人管小孩
You realize I'm not a child who needs permission to go outside.

244
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,330
对吧
Correct?

245
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,160
达米安 我不是在审问
Damien, I wasn't interrogating.

246
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,360
只是感兴趣而已
Just taking an interest.

247
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,570
我出去巡逻
I go out on patrol.

248
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:56,070
对了  恭喜你有了新欢 格雷森
By the way, I should offer congratulations on your cohabitation, Grayson.

249
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,740
星火证明她是一个够格的领袖
Starfire has proven herself to be a decent leader.

250
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,710
我同意
I approve.

251
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,080
谢谢你
Thank you.

252
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,880
你在蜂巢文件里找到什么了吗
Have you found anything in the H.I.V.E. Files?

253
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,580
没什么  但我仍在查
Nothing Earth-shaking, but I'm still checking.

254
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,820
听起来你什么都没查到
Sounds like you got squat.

255
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,850
我至少还能享受下正常生活
I love endangering my life for nothing.

256
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,590
上次突袭拿到的新的文件
Which is why I've added the newest files to the ones

257
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,920
已经损毁的无法阅读了
too damaged to read, from the previous raids.

258
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,790
希望电脑能为我们找到其中的关联
I'm hoping the computer will find a connection we missed.

259
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,500
程序得花一到两天处理这些信息
It may take the program a day or two.

260
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,060
至少还有希望
Not your worst idea.

261
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,270
干嘛
What?

262
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,210
呃
Ugh!

263
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,510
嘿 你们谁见杰米了
Hey, anyone seen Jaime?

264
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,710
他就在那儿
Yeah, he's right there.

265
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,420
有点不对劲
Something is wrong.

266
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,350
是啊 他输掉球赛了
Yeah, there is. He's about to be crushed at Foosball.

267
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,550
你想来瞧瞧嘛
You wanna come see?

268
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,620
起开
Buzz off.

269
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,130
也许你应该去
Maybe you should go.

270
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,360
也许你们两个都去是个好主意
Might be good to have two of you down there.

271
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,040
如我所说 不服从的人
And I say to you. Those who deny the chosen,

272
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,640
在即将建立的乐园中没有栖脚的地方
have no place in the Eden that shall be built.

273
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,580
罪人和亵渎者 那些与我们价值观念不同的人
Sinners and blasphemers who do not share our values

274
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,710
将被抛弃
need not apply,

275
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,550
兄弟姊妹们
brothers and sisters.

276
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,250
全能的 兄弟血会
Hail, brother blood!

277
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,620
万岁 万岁 万岁
Hail, hail, hail.

278
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,290
全能的 血色兄弟
Hail, brother blood.

279
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,460
万岁 万岁 万岁
Hail, hail, hail...

280
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,660
啊 你在这儿 迈赫姆
Ah, there you are, mayhem.

281
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,800
你为何
Punctual as always.

282
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,210
这么冷静的
How can you be so calm?

283
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,810
这是第三个被少年泰坦摧毁的基地
That was the third base the Titans have destroyed.

284
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,410
我的计划历经九百年的风雨
My plan is nine centuries in the making.

285
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:47,010
每个年代都有人反抗
In every age, there are always those who oppose me.

286
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,420
但如你所见
But as you can see,

287
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,290
我总是赢家
I am always victorious.

288
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,390
这是那个记者吗
Is that the reporter?

289
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,630
是他
Yes.

290
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,360
我们的朋友再也不会问出那些粗鲁的问题了
Our friend won't be asking impertinent questions anymore.

291
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,970
他的质疑远不及少年泰坦带来的威胁
His heresy does not compare to the titan's threat.

292
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,240
我们几乎无法逃脱他们
We barely escaped them.

293
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,570
但你做到了
But you did,

294
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,970
因为他警告过你
because he warned you.

295
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,110
我们的守护天使
Our guardian angel.

296
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,540
别做无谓的担心了
Oh, stop your fretting, mayhem.

297
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,880
他会保证泰坦不捣乱
He'll keep the Titans at bay.

298
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,850
我已预见
I've foreseen it.

299
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,190
再加上 我付那混蛋足够的钱
Plus, I pay the bastard enough.

300
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,070
你能慢点吗 杰米
Could you slow down, Jaime?

301
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,870
那你回塔上吧
Go back to the tower then.

302
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,270
没人请你来
Nobody asked you to come.

303
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,540
噢 别这样 我们可是挺你的
Oh, come on. We're here to support you.

304
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,810
我可不是
I'm not.

305
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,420
我的意思是 我尊重杰米的意见
What I mean is, I respect Jaime not wanting to talk.

306
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,920
事实上 有些人应该好好学学怎么闭上他的嘴巴
In fact, more people should learn to shut their mouths.

307
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,350
好吧 那可真没意思
Well, that's no fun.

308
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,630
呃 好吧 我闭嘴
Uh, okay, I give up.

309
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,900
瞧
The center.

310
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,570
我的父母在乡下也做义工
My parents volunteer for the one in my town.

311
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,640
所以…
And...

312
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,410
也许我也该做义工
Maybe I should volunteer.

313
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,140
是的 没错儿
Yeah, right.

314
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,880
我们是泰坦
We're Titans.

315
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,310
我们不是给人舀汤的
We don't serve soup.

316
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,780
你不需要非得移动座山
You don't have to move a mountain

317
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,910
才算帮助别人 泰拉
to help people, Terra.

318
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,850
况且 我得想个办法
Besides, I gotta find a way to make the bug

319
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,850
让虫子在人类附近觉得更加舒服
more comfortable around humans.

320
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,590
我能帮你什么吗
Can I help you?

321
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,660
是的 呃
Yes, um,

322
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,300
崔西
Traci.

323
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,000
我想知道如果我想做义务劳动应该找谁
I was wondering who I can speak to about volunteering?

324
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,330
找我就对了
That would be me.

325
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,140
这下好了
And there it is.

326
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,500
仅仅因为我们的超能力
Just because we have powers

327
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,570
并不意味着我们就不能 你知道
doesn't mean we can't, you know,

328
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,010
建立关系
have relationships.

329
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,280
你不觉得吗
Don't you think?

330
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,980
嘿 享受生活没错儿 对吗
Hey, there's nothing wrong with having a life, right?

331
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,280
杀了她
Kill her!

332
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,820
杀了这个恶魔
Kill the demon!

333
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,620
怎么了
What's the matter?

334
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,830
没什么
Nothing.

335
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,500
真是差劲 我要离开
This is lame. I'm out.

336
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,370
在这千年里  我在敌人的血中沐浴
For nearly a millennium, I have bathed in my enemy's blood,

337
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,340
这么做
and for some mysterious reason,

338
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,810
可以使我永生
it has provided me immortality.

339
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,680
我总是好奇为什么
I have often wondered why?

340
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,920
为什么是我
Why me?

341
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,450
但现在我知道了
But now I know.

342
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,790
这是 天意让我
It was meant to bring me to this age,

343
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,920
在此地 在此时
this place, this moment,

344
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:48,060
借助科技的力量
where technology can at last be made to serve my greatness.

345
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,300
运行
Proceed.

346
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,650
你做的非常好
You've done well.

347
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,490
开始准备 迈赫姆 时机已到
Advance the preparations, mayhem. The time has come

348
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:51,190
让我们永生之荣耀
for us to move from immortality to glory.

349
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,130
多谢你的付出
Your service has come to an end.

350
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,100
祝福你 我的孩子
Bless you, my son.

351
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,010
作为宇宙公主
For a space Princess,

352
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,580
你的东西还真不少
you sure have a lot of stuff.

353
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,220
我还是小女孩的时候就有这个了
I've had this since I was a little girl.

354
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,390
这是我唯一有时间拿走的东西
It was the only thing I had time to take.

355
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,800
又来
Not again.

356
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,400
泰拉 你还好吗
Terra, are you okay?

357
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,110
她就快要把整个楼都弄到了
She's going to bring the building down.

358
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,540
我能帮助她
I can help.

359
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,550
你在干吗
What are you doing?

360
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,650
滚开
Get off me!

361
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,950
你在发动你的能力  土石女
You were shaking everything, Terra.

362
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,250
我们来看你
We came to check on you.

363
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,320
你还好吗
Are you all right?

364
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,990
只是个该死的噩梦罢了
It's a freaking nightmare.

365
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,690
你们快走吧 让我一个人静一静
Just leave me alone.

366
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,590
我很好 所以 走吧
I'm okay, so, get going.

367
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,530
你们听见我说的乐 走啊
You heard me. Get going.

368
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,700
还有你 绿豆芽
You too, greeny.

369
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,340
这种事发生得多吗
Does that happen a lot?

370
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,710
足够多
It happens enough.

371
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,080
- 你看到什么了  - 什么都没看到
- What did you see?  - Nothing.

372
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,880
而且就算我看到任何东西也跟你没关系
And if I did see anything, it wouldn't be your business.

373
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,250
塔里发生的一切都跟我有关系
Everything that goes on in the tower is my business.

374
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,550
不管是谁
Just like it should be for all of you.

375
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,560
据我所知 达米安 柯莉安才是头 而不是你
The last I checked, Damien, Kori was in charge, not you.

376
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,770
很高兴再次见到你 我的朋友
So good to see you again, my friends.

377
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,540
已经过去太长的时间
It's been too long.

378
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,670
太长了
Too long.

379
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,580
别把这搞得神经兮兮 布拉德
Don't make this weirder than it already is, blood.

380
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,210
你是说装束
Are you referring to the setting?

381
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,450
我自己从中获取力量
I myself take strength from it.

382
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,220
墓地不是一个该被畏惧的地方
The cemetery isn't a place to be feared.

383
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,850
而是重生的地方
It's a place of renewal.

384
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,920
对你我见面的地方我没有任何意见
I have no problem meeting anywhere you want,

385
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,390
但我担心我的雇主是个神经病
but I get concerned when my employer talks to himself.

386
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,130
我在跟死者说话
I talk to the dead,

387
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:12,770
无论尸体如何腐烂 总是有一线生气存留
for no matter how rotted the corpse, there's always a tiny wisp of life left.

388
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:15,500
有时候足够把它们带回来
Sometimes enough life to bring them back.

389
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,840
你们都该明白
You of all people should know that.

390
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,880
你想要什么 布拉德
What do you want, blood?

391
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,410
我想在一周内得到进展
I want to move everything up by a week.

392
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,310
我已经等待了足够久的时间 丧钟
I've waited long enough, Deathstroke.

393
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,780
这不是我们约好的
That wasn't the deal.

394
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,990
我会付你双倍的酬金
I'll double your price.

395
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,120
这可以接受吗
Is that acceptable?

396
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,560
就像之前 我要所有的泰坦
As before, I want all the Titans.

397
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,660
你能做到吗
Can you do it?

398
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,230
时刻准备着
To be ready for anything,

399
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,500
你们必须为一切情况而训练
you must train for everything.

400
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,410
这是欧喀拉的军阀教我的
That was the most important lesson

401
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:54,240
最 刻骨铭心的教训
instilled in me by the warlords of Okaara.

402
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,710
又是他们
Dude... Them again?

403
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,110
老兄
Dude...

404
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,880
这同样应该在你们的心中铭记
And so it shall be instilled in you.

405
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,150
让我们对练
Let's pair off.

406
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,650
那些不在战斗中的 就观察学习
Those not fighting, watch and learn.

407
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:05,790
夜翼
Nightwing.

408
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,360
让我们起舞 先生
Shall we dance, good sir?

409
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,230
当然 我的女士
But of course, my lady.

410
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:38,950
看来我们知道是孰强孰弱了
Guess we know who's taking out the garbage at the new place.

411
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,220
这对你没一点好处
That was not a confidence booster.

412
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,460
你做的非常好
You did very well.

413
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,890
你这次坚持的时间远远要比以前久
You lasted far longer this time.

414
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,160
我当然指的是训练
I meant in training, of course.

415
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,770
当我们… 他可是非常熟练
He's very proficient when we have...

416
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,830
柯莉
Kori!

417
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,000
蓝甲虫 渡鸦
Blue Beetle, Raven.

418
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,360
抱歉 渡鸦 虫子不想输
Sorry, Raven, the bug doesn't wanna lose.

419
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,990
难道你想
And you do?

420
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:30,400
真对不起 你还好吗
Dios mio! I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

421
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:33,470
你在做什么
What the hell are you doing?

422
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,580
阿 我没事
Ah, I'm fine.

423
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,810
父亲觉得我让自己蒙羞
But dad feels I've disgraced myself.

424
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,880
所以就很好
So that's nice.

425
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,020
野兽小子 土石女 你们准备好了吗
Beast Boy, Terra, you ready?

426
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,830
抱歉
Right. Sorry.

427
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,500
我会让着土石女的
I'll take it easy on Terra.

428
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,630
我可很享受让你闭嘴
I'm gonna enjoy shutting you up.

429
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,900
除非你能抓到我 老妈
Only if you catch me, mama.

430
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,330
亲爱的 就让我给你一个大拥抱
Mon Cherie, let Garfield give you a big hug.

431
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,390
嗯 好软
Mmm, so soft.

432
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,860
亲下你再放你走
I let you go for a little kiss.

433
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,710
杀了她
Kill her!

434
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:53,090
女巫 你罪有应得
Now, witch, you get what's coming to you!

435
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,590
你管谁叫女巫
Who you calling a witch?

436
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,730
土石女
Terra!

437
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,970
她打算杀了他
She's going to kill him!

438
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,710
啊
Argh!

439
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,680
土石女 控制你自己
Terra, control yourself!

440
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,950
什么
What?

441
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,580
怎么回事
What's going on?

442
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:28,420
抱歉 这不是我的错
I'm sorry, it's not my fault.

443
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,260
- 让我平静下你的心  - 不
- Let me calm your mind.  - No!

444
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:34,060
- 别碰我  - 没关系的 土石女 我们理解
- Don't touch me.  - It's okay Terra, we understand.

445
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,400
放松
Take a breath.

446
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,960
我们在这里是为了你
We're here for you.

447
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:40,600
是啊 我知道你并不想伤害我 只是我做的太过了
Yeah. I know you didn't mean to hurt me. I took it too far.

448
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,910
你们这些人是怎么回事儿
What's wrong with you people?

449
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:11,430
我知道你打算说什么 土石女需要更多的训练
I know what you're going to say. Terra needs more training.

450
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,500
不 是别的事儿
No, it's something else.

451
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,040
她知道一些
She knows.

452
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:21,040
自从我们谈过之后 我已经感受到了关于土石女的一些东西
Since we talked, I have sensed something off about Terra.

453
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,040
格雷森 我们要多注意她
She needs to be watched, Grayson.

454
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:26,310
她需要理解而不是监视
She needs understanding not surveillance.

455
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,220
土石女 她虽然不是完人  但科里认为她是值得的
Terra, has her rough edges. But Corey thinks she's worth it.

456
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,890
我同意他的
And I agree.

457
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,520
你的仁慈 迟早会出事
Making decisions with your heart will get people killed.

458
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,820
不能有人和我
It's not like I can't sense the vibrations of someone following me.

459
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,860
即使他们在屋顶上
Even if they are on a roof.

460
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,260
我知道你不喜欢这个
I know what it's like not to fit in with the group.

461
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,500
什么错
What's wrong?

462
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:19,570
猴子男孩 渡鸦
Aside from monkey boy making me melt down, or Raven staring all the time,

463
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,800
还有夜翼 像个老妈妈 海梅还有他的甲虫
Nightwing, acting like a den mother, Jaime and his freako bug,

464
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:27,510
嗯 还有你 我的又一个暗恋者
miss smiles-a-lot, and you, my new stalker,

465
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,040
你没什么要说吧
huh, nothing I guess.

466
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,010
你需要我们的帮助
If you need to talk

467
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,980
就告诉我们
let us help you.

468
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:39,890
多么贴心的男孩
Such an observant, considerate boy.

469
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,220
你不会是真心的吧
You would think he truly cares.

470
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,590
斯莱德 你还没死啊
Slade? Look what hell just spit up.

471
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,960
退后
Stay back.

472
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:56,240
让我猜猜 他们不要你吗
Let me guess, they got you to a Lazarus pit, just in time.

473
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,870
先让你过过嘴瘾
Yes, I've been bathing in it quite a bit, lately.

474
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,010
待会就
You might say, it's addictive.

475
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,610
要你哭
Improves muscle tone too.

476
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:24,500
你的锋芒没了
Losing your edge.

477
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,770
你的朋友让你变的软弱
Your friends have made you soft.

478
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,950
就像我说的
Like I said, soft.

479
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,320
怎么这么久
Took you long enough.

480
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,970
你背叛了我们 为什么
You betrayed us, why?

481
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,370
背叛
Betrayed?

482
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:06,810
我从来就不是你们这边的
That assumes I was ever on your side in the first place.

483
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,860
给你 费尔南德斯先生
There you go, Mr. Fernandez.

484
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,160
- 很高兴有你的帮忙  谢谢你  - 不
- Great to have your help. Thanks.  - No.

485
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,530
应该是我说谢谢
Thank you.

486
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,530
这里
I kinda needed this.

487
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,800
让我想起了家
This just reminds me of home.

488
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,670
- 高温  - 小心
- Ow! Huh, hot.  - Careful.

489
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,970
你可不想被烧伤吧
You don't wanna get burned.

490
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:43,940
你有听到什么吗
Do you hear that?

491
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:46,350
- 好像在那  - 嗯…
- I heard it before.  - Uh...

492
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,850
我希望他们命够长
I hope there's not a short.

493
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:50,020
我想我知道它们在哪里
I think I heard it move over there.

494
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,590
我知道我心跳的很厉害
I know my pulse is racing.

495
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,460
但我没有危险 没有
But I'm in no danger. None.

496
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:02,360
不需要防御措施 我 怎么解释
Defensive measures are not needed. Oh, boy, how do I explain this?

497
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:06,000
称为性吸引力
There's something humans call sexual attraction.

498
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,740
唉 命啊
Aye, my life.

499
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,110
嗯 海梅
Uh, Jaime?

500
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:28,020
你在做什么
What are you doing?

501
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,860
我以为这会让你更舒服
I thought I'd get more comfortable.

502
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,530
不要
Don't.

503
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:36,060
你不能这么做
You can't run over here at the first sign of trouble.

504
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,430
我以为我失败了
I was losing it. I had to see you.

505
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,700
幸运的是罗宾自投罗网
Luckily taking Robin out works.

506
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,540
只是一个人而已
Grabs a handful.

507
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,840
想个办法把他也弄出来
Best to get him out of the way.

508
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,810
他总是很多疑
He was suspicious.

509
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,380
永远是
Always is.

510
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,780
他很聪明
Didn't say he was stupid.

511
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,850
损坏了相机镜头
He damaged the camera lens.

512
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:57,320
格林妮做的
Greenie was asking for it.

513
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:04,220
需要很多时间才能打败泰坦
It's taken a year to get the information I need to defeat theTitans.

514
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:07,460
别动
Could've ruined everything. Stay still.

515
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,470
- 杀了她  - 杀死女巫
- Kill her!  - Kill the witch!

516
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,780
杀死女巫 她是个恶魔
Kill the witch! She's a demon!

517
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,280
杀了她
Kill her now!

518
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,970
离开或死亡
Leave or die. Your choice.

519
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,910
马拉姆 泰拉
Terra Markov?

520
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,810
我听说你是一个特别的女孩
I heard you're a special girl.

521
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,450
这是真的吗
Is that true?

522
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,120
我的名字是斯莱德
My name is Slade.

523
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,150
看来我找到了
Looks like I got it.

524
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,960
不 你没有
Not yet, you haven't.

525
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,430
但你可以
But you could.

526
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:16,030
- 我们讨论过这个  - 我不是一个孩子
- We discussed this.  - I'm not a kid.

527
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:19,070
- 你说我们会在一起  - 还没到时候
- You said we'd be together.  - Not yet.

528
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,230
任务要紧
The contract is everything.

529
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,170
我们需要先处理眼前的事
We need total concentration for it.

530
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:26,240
你知道还有很多工作要做
You know it's taken a lot of work to get here.

531
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,380
- 尤其是你  - 我不想回去
- Especially by you.  - I don't wanna go back.

532
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,410
泰坦表现的好像他们在关心我
The Titans are always acting like they care so much.

533
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:34,450
这让我不知所措
It messes with my head.

534
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,180
马上就好 泰拉
Just a little longer, Terra.

535
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:40,720
有了血会的钱 我们将有自己的刺客联盟
With the money from blood we'll form our own league of assassins.

536
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,260
你和我
You and I.

537
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,160
将浪迹天涯
Together in every way.

538
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:02,640
我还没看到过这么多武器
I didn't see you bringing quite so many weapons to our new place.

539
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,350
- 如果你不喜欢  - 不不不 我喜欢
- If you don't like them...  - No, no. They're great.

540
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,550
有事吗
Is something up?

541
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,790
在训练场的事件之后
After the incident at the training field

542
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:19,260
我觉得你不需要我也可以统领他们
you met with members of the team without me.

543
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,430
是 这不一样
Yeah, we talked. But it wasn't a meeting.

544
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,800
柯莉 你知道我永远不会破坏你 对吧
Kori, you know I'd never undermine you, right?

545
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,330
他们需要你
They went to you.

546
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,870
你是…是一个伟大的领导者
You were... Are a great leader.

547
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:33,110
所以 他们盼着你回来了
So, they instinctively look to you, now that you're back.

548
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,280
毕竟 我不是你们这个世界的人
After all, I'm not even from your world.

549
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,350
不要这样
Hey. Stop.

550
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:45,150
泰坦们选择你来领导他们
You were chosen by the team to lead them.

551
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:49,060
而且我不能没有你
And have I told you how glad I am that you've chosen to move in with me?

552
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,660
我至少还有你
At least I was your first choice for that.

553
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:55,460
没错 你至少可以住我这
Yeah. Well, gar's got his house and Jaime couldn't afford the rent.

554
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,500
你这个家伙
You brat.

555
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,700
达米安 当然
Damian! Of course.

556
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,210
真会挑时间
Perfect timing.

557
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,410
- 什么事  - 他在做某事
- Solo?  - He's working on something.

558
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,450
待会再管
Have I mentioned he approves of us?

559
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,920
复议
So do I.

560
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:25,190
干嘛
Yeah? Problem?

561
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,130
没啥事
Not yet.

562
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,130
那就再见
Nice visit.

563
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:34,730
我知道我们之间有矛盾
I know I'm not easy to get close to.

564
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,540
我们要谈谈
We have that in common, I think.

565
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,410
而且我也有办法缓解你的精神问题
But I could teach you some meditation techniques.

566
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,210
让你更好的控制自己
It might help you stay in control.

567
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:44,440
那 那也许
Maybe. Maybe so.

568
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:49,420
还有 我们要举行聚餐活动
The other reason I'm here is to tell you the team's assembling in the common room.

569
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,150
你先走 我待会就来
I need a minute. You go on ahead.

570
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,830
他们知道了
They know about Robin.

571
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:05,030
他们不知道
They don't.

572
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,900
掠夺者 没问题吗
Raven, being nice?

573
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,900
我怎么不知道有聚餐这一回事
And there's nothing scheduled.

574
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,370
除非他们知道我和你在合作
They know I'm working with you.

575
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,670
如果他们知道 就不会让她一个人过来
If they knew, she wouldn't have come alone.

576
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,770
除非他们想让我放下戒备
Unless they wanted to get my guard down.

577
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,040
我不知道我能不能成功
I don't think I can take them all if they're ready.

578
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:20,150
冷静  他们没有怀疑你
Calm yourself. The fools trust you.

579
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,610
放轻松
Use that.

580
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,000
惊喜
Surprise!

581
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,370
该死
Shit.

582
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:48,440
你们吓到我了
You guys scared me.

583
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,180
[泰拉 周年纪念日快乐]
你们干什么
We can see that.

584
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,450
- 为了我吗  - 是的
- Are those for me?  - They sure are.

585
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,220
作为你的一周年泰坦纪念日
For your one year anniversary as a member of the Titans.

586
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:58,250
- 渡鸦想出来的主意  - 我…
- It was all Raven's idea.  - I...

587
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,790
从没有人为我这么做过这样的事情
No one has ever done anything like this for me.

588
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,220
谢谢
Thanks.

589
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,390
非常感谢
Thanks a lot.

590
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:12,770
抹干眼泪 开始嗨皮吧
Dry those tears and let's get this party started, mama!

591
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:43,500
电脑处理完了
The computer's done.

592
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,030
- 血会的文件  - 让我们看看
- The one with blood's files.  - Let's take a look.

593
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,440
文件重构和集成完成
File reconstruction and integration complete.

594
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:57,180
这个科学家曾经为蜂巢工作
That scientist used to work for H.I.V.E.

595
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,150
没有找到尸体
Body never recovered.

596
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,120
似乎他的个人实验室仍在为
Seems his personal lab is still being paid for

597
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,150
血会的子公司服务
by one of blood's holding companies.

598
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,450
泰坦们应该来看下
The Titans should look into this.

599
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:13,460
看来你要错过为
Beast Boy's sending you pictures of Terra’s party.

600
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,930
泰拉举办的聚会了
Shame you're missing it.

601
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:22,600
你就这么点本事吗
You should go. Playing with teenagers is about your speed.

602
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,210
小子 激将法对我无用
I'm not gonna let you bait me, kid.

603
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,370
哦 可惜
Oh, what the hell.

604
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:34,110
切
Big man.

605
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:38,520
你不让我离开这里
Why not get me out of here so I can defend myself properly?

606
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,320
- 是不是你在害怕  - 真的吗
- Unless, you're afraid.  - Really?

607
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:47,160
把你放了 然后再打一架
You're down to hoping I'm gonna act like the biggest stooge in a b-movie?

608
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,660
你不这么想吗
Your outfit said give it a shot.

609
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,670
你以为你是谁
Grandson of the demon's head, you are not.

610
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,140
你只是一个小屁孩
You're an entitled brat.

611
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:01,470
当我崛起时你还不知在哪
I Rose from nothing while you had everything handed to you.

612
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,180
你只是一个跳梁小丑
You cost me my rightful place.

613
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:07,210
和你背叛的家庭
And the family you betrayed.

614
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,450
他们选择了你
They turned on me by choosing you.

615
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:12,890
达米安 刺客联盟没了
You took my old family, Damian.

616
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,020
不过我会再创造一个新的
So I'll take your new one.

617
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:23,500
我先离开会
I should reply.

618
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,470
我们走的瞧
I am well and will see you soon.

619
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,640
你更像另一个迪克
You're more of a dick.

620
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:37,240
卧底 别打扰我
Undercover. Don't bother me.

621
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:40,850
我不会花很多时间
Shame I don't have more time to break you down.

622
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:45,920
只要一个月 我就会让你跪地求饶
Inside a month, I'd have you bringing me my pipe and calling me papa.

623
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,490
斯勒德 待会再说
Slade? Get your head out of your ass.

624
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:52,530
- 听到吗  - 如果我们找到科学家
- You seeing this?  - And if we do find the scientist,

625
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:55,160
我们要活捉他
we want him alive at all cost.

626
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,900
五分钟后行动
We leave in five minutes.

627
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,340
乖乖呆着
Be a good boy.

628
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,830
小心
Careful. Watch your spacing.

629
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,500
[处理完成]

630
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,320
有有没有主意
Any idea what that gizmo is?

631
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,260
没有
Nothing good.

632
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:04,160
待会再吵
He's deleting. I vote we stop that.

633
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,700
让我们两个
That makes two of us.

634
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,570
好吧 三个
Okay, three.

635
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,340
远离电脑 就完事大吉
Step away from the computer. You won't be hurt.

636
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,380
你先去 我随后到
Go after him. I'll cover you.

637
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,430
我们应该留在聚会上
We should have stayed at the party.

638
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:12,030
没什么好抱怨
Quit complaining.

639
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,380
那我就奉陪到底
Oh, you wanna play?

640
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:39,390
差劲
That's it? Lame.

641
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:53,410
你想先问他什么
What do you want to ask him first?

642
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,520
倒霉
Bad luck for him.

643
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,460
至少不是一无所获
At least it wasn't one of us.

644
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:16,000
话没错
Yes, bad luck.

645
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,800
就是不能和他细谈了
That we couldn't speak with him about these.

646
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:23,940
也许他是个粉丝
Maybe he was a fan?

647
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,950
他们竟然在研究我们
Is it really a surprise they would study us?

648
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,850
我们几个月前就再与他们作战
We've been defeating them for months.

649
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:37,320
这里面竟然有你
And you were after them even before that.

650
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,750
他们调查的如此深入
But this stuff is so in-depth.

651
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,420
在调查我们的基因构造
Things on genetic makeup.

652
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,290
渡鸦与野兽男孩的
Theories on Raven's power.

653
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:45,090
力量来源
Beast Boy's too.

654
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:46,830
还有蓝甲虫
And Beetle's suit.

655
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:48,730
但为什么
What's it for?

656
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:50,660
把罗宾召回来
We need to get Robin back here.

657
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:52,530
你知道他这人又多不守纪
You know how stubborn he can be.

658
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:56,670
他是我们的成员
He's a titan. He needs to be here.

659
00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:01,040
都怪蜂巢打扰了我们的聚会
Nothing like laser-spewing H.I.V.E drones to take you out of a party mood.

660
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,240
我决定明天中饭在中心区吃
I'm beat and I'm making lunch at the center tomorrow.

661
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,010
真会泼冷水
In more exciting news,

662
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:11,780
我明天也受邀参加凯文·史密斯的播客聚会
I've been invited to be on Kevin Smith's podcast at Metrocon tomorrow.

663
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:14,220
等下 星火有事宣布
Hold up, Starfire's got something to say.

664
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:17,560
由于今天晚上的发现
With what we discovered tonight,

665
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,760
我们将要提高警惕
we all need to be extra vigilant

666
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,700
不要疏忽大意
and not take any chances.

667
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,000
不是吧 那可是凯文·史密斯
Are you kidding me? It's Kevin Smith.

668
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,770
我没有说禁止你们自由行动
I didn't say don't do what you have planned.

669
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:32,770
提高警惕 还有保持通讯畅通
But keep your eyes and comm lines open at all times.

670
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:37,210
我觉得兄弟血会要有所行动了
I have a feeling whatever blood is planning tonight is just a prelude.

671
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:03,200
抱歉你的聚会以这种方式结束
Sorry your party was interrupted.

672
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,670
这也没办法
That's the way it goes.

673
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:08,410
别又跟以前一样
Don't let all that talk back there shake you up.

674
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:10,680
你知道我是你这边的
You know I got your back.

675
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,250
其他的事
It's other stuff.

676
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,250
什么
Like what?

677
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,290
我洗耳恭听
I'm all ears.

678
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:24,120
你笑起来更好看
You've a pretty smile.

679
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:29,200
你知道我怎么变成孤儿的吗
Do you know how I became an orphan?

680
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:32,270
嗯 你的父母去世了
Uh, your parents died?

681
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,830
不是
No.

682
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,970
因为我的能力 他们吓坏了
After I got powers, they freaked.

683
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:40,170
他们是我为异人
Thought I was possessed or something.

684
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,680
对不起
I'm sorry.

685
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:45,580
不要这样
Don't be.

686
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,150
我不需要你的怜悯
I don't need your pity.

687
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:53,920
我只是想拉近我们的关系
It can be a bond, you know?

688
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,060
团队里的每个人都有一个不幸过去
Everyone on the team's had it rough.

689
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,890
是啊
Yeah.

690
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:01,130
一个公主 穿着闪闪发光的丁字裤从垃圾桶找食物
I can tell Princess sparkle thong knows all about eating from a dumpster.

691
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:04,900
柯莉被她妹妹夺了权
Kori is a refugee being stalked by her homicidal sister.

692
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,930
杰米有一个爱他的家庭
Jaime has a family that loves him.

693
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:10,940
由于那个甲虫 他不能和他的家人生活在一起
And, because of the bug, odds are he's never seeing them face-to-face again.

694
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:17,440
每个英雄都有苦处
I think pain is what makes a hero.

695
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:21,710
金无足赤 人无完人
It's like a pressure that either forms a diamond or grinds you into dust.

696
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,120
开心果 你呢
But what about you, chuckles?

697
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,590
你又没有什么苦处
Aside from an unhealthy online presence, you're normal.

698
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:35,660
是啊 你是绿色的
Yeah, you're green.

699
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,530
你不会去改变它的
You wouldn't change it if you could.

700
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:39,330
你喜欢引人注目
You like the attention.

701
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:40,670
除此在外
Besides

702
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:42,200
你一切正常
it looks okay on you.

703
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,830
你没杀我
You didn't kill me.

704
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:12,100
这一次
This time.

705
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,100
说明不了什么 笨蛋
Don't get used to it, jerk.

706
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:20,710
高兴 开心
Yes! Yeah!

707
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,040
我最牛 哈哈
Whoo-hew! Yeah, baby! Ha-ha!

708
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:31,320
我最强
Oh, yeah, baby!

709
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,150
我们走吧
Let's go!

710
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,990
开心
Nice play.

711
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:42,160
一切就绪
Almost bought it myself.

712
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,000
我们明天行动
We move tomorrow.

713
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:54,970
我有点累了 加油
I'm tired, gar.

714
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:58,840
是的 当然 好的
Yeah, sure, totally get it.

715
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:05,350
明天见还有后天
See you tomorrow. And the next day.

716
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,110
我会搞的
Yeah, I got them all in.

717
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:36,020
我知道我是蠢货但我搞的定
Hey, I know I'm a noob but I got this.

718
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:38,920
再见
See you when you get here, .

719
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:52,300
这里一定有很多人
The guest of honor with one million followers is...

720
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,800
是这没错吧
Uh, here?

721
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,110
有人吗
Hello?

722
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,710
凯文或者其他人
Kevin? Other guy?

723
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:23,830
今天下午我们应该再好好把文件再复查一遍
I think we should look over the files again, this afternoon.

724
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:26,130
确保我们没有遗落什么
Make sure we didn't miss anything.

725
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:30,340
遵命
Sure thing.

726
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:34,310
一切安排听从组织
And per your orders, I'll check on Jaime and gar.

727
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:37,310
你不必这样做 但谢谢
You don't have to do that, but thanks.

728
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:38,980
还有
By the way...

729
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:44,780
我想我搞不定这个
The warlords of Okaara didn't teach me much about cooking.

730
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:47,690
看来要定外卖了
I think you should pick something up on the way back.

731
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:49,190
回见
See you soon, babe.

732
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,490
怎么了
What's going on?

733
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:26,790
早应该开门了
Not sure. It should be open.

734
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:28,160
也许他忘了
We got a new guy.

735
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:39,970
杰米
Jaime?

736
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:48,310
杰米
Jaime?

737
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,520
泰坦蓝甲虫被抓走了
Titans, Blue Beetle has been taken.

738
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,820
在塔上集合
Gather at the tower.

739
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:31,820
这里是柯莉和迪克 我们不在家
This is Kori and dick. We're not home now.

740
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:34,490
请留言
So leave a message.

741
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,700
星火接电话 我要去接野兽小子
Starfire, pick up if you're there. I'm going to get Beast Boy.

742
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,630
在塔楼汇合
Get to the tower now.

743
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:09,330
不是吧
Oh, come on, gar.

744
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,500
柯莉 你在吗
Kori, you here?

745
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:25,640
柯莉
Kori.

746
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,050
丧钟已敲响
Bad day, Nightwing?

747
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:34,790
末日来临
It's about to get worse.

748
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:37,460
你对其他人做了什么
What have you done with Kori and the others?

749
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:40,660
别担心
Don't fret.

750
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,590
你马上就回和他们见面了
I'm here to take you to them.

751
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,230
混蛋 休想
Bring it, asshole.

752
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,640
就这么点
Akido needs work.

753
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,310
你就这么点水平
Your spacing's for shit.

754
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,320
你太嫩了
You're overrated, kid.

755
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:14,060
该死
Damn it.

756
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:52,100
够了
Enough.

757
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,430
该结束了
Screw this.

758
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:09,350
格雷森 你逃了又如何
You could have died by the Blade with honor, Grayson.

759
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:11,720
手下败将
Loser.

760
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,320
任务完成了吗
Is it done?

761
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:23,730
是 搞定了
Yeah, we're good.

762
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:29,900
他在骗你
He's lying to you.

763
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,730
所有的都是谎言
About everything.

764
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:34,130
他以此为生
He had you pegged from the start.

765
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,270
他为了达到目的
That's how he does it.

766
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:38,140
不惜手段
Mixing truth with lies.

767
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:40,040
你就继续扯吧
You're so freaking annoying.

768
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,870
你知道什么
You don't know anything about him.

769
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,680
他救了我的命
He saved me.

770
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:47,210
让我猜猜 他让你只
Let me guess, he kept you isolated.

771
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:48,780
依赖他
Dependent.

772
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:51,250
敌视所有人
Told you everyone was your enemy.

773
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:54,090
然后训练你
Trained you, ruthlessly.

774
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,890
向你许下承诺
And promised you exactly what you wanted.

775
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,190
我知道他所有的套路
Believe me, I know.

776
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,640
我一直很讨厌你
I've always hated you.

777
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,110
还有其他人
You and all the others.

778
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:15,970
泰坦对待你像家人
The Titans treated you like family.

779
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:18,410
而你却背叛了我们
And you threw it all away.

780
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,310
闭嘴
Stop...

781
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:27,390
你先离开一会
Can't I leave you for two minutes?

782
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:33,230
我明白你为什么要杀了他了
I can see why you want him dead.

783
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:55,580
怎么了
What's wrong?

784
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:58,520
再过几个小时 我们就离开这里
In a few hours, we're gone.

785
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,290
任务完成了
It's as good as done.

786
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,520
很高兴终于结束了
Just glad this is over.

787
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:08,390
你已经卧底了一年了
You've been in deep cover for a year.

788
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,900
对他们有感情是完全正常的
It's perfectly normal to have feelings for them.

789
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,330
以后就只有我们两个了
But after this we can be together.

790
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:15,900
这不正是你所希望的吗
Just like you wanted.

791
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,440
别让他影响你
Concentrate on that.

792
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:46,470
电脑 跟踪泰拉马尔可夫的手机
Computer, track Terra Markov's phone.

793
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:48,700
已发现 主体正在移动
Discovered, subject is moving.

794
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:50,870
我想也是
I'll bet she is.

795
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:57,340
兄弟姐妹 我一再强调
Brothers and sisters, I have spoken many times

796
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,280
所谓的神
about false gods.

797
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:03,820
只不过是
These so-called heroes with no allegiance to our cause,

798
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:07,920
那些所谓的超级英雄
are nothing but secular idols and must be ended.

799
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:13,760
世间 只有我才是真正的神
This is the true house of faith and I am the one true god.

800
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,860
血兄弟万岁 万岁
Hail brother blood. Hail, hail!

801
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:21,670
现在圣光
Today, I am claiming their powers for us all.

802
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:25,440
已降临到我们身上
For we are the seeds of the next generation.

803
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,340
我们蜂巢的身上
We are the hive of humanity.

804
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:31,140
再也不会有人来阻止
And nothing will stand in our way.

805
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:33,210
我降下圣光
Raise me this holy day.

806
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:35,410
我们将主宰世界
The day of blood.

807
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:37,680
兄弟血会万岁 万岁
Hail brother blood. Hail...

808
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:39,990
这个地方让我毛骨悚然
Place gives me the creeps.

809
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:41,350
我听到了
I hear you.

810
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:48,060
伙计们 渡鸦有点不对劲
Huh? Guys, Raven's not moving.

811
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:51,360
这里有东西抑制了我的能力
Something's keeping me from using my powers to morph.

812
01:02:51,370 --> 01:02:53,470
是的 机器就是这么设计的
Yeah, the machine's doing that.

813
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:55,530
是我把你们放了进去
But, I'm the one who put you here.

814
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:57,870
丧钟
Deathstroke.

815
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,070
你对罗宾做了什么
What have you done to Robin?

816
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,980
他嘴巴太臭了
I beat the crap out of him for being mouthy.

817
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:08,150
你们也想试试吗
Come on, you've all had the urge.

818
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:11,680
一旦我出来 我会揍你一顿
Once I get out, I'm gonna break you into little bits.

819
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:14,690
有理想
It's good to have goals, ese.

820
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:18,590
在你们死后我会好好的享受会的
Me, I'm having waffles, after you're dead.

821
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:24,300
顺便 向你们介绍一下我的助手
By the way, can I introduce you to my assistant?

822
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,860
我想你们已经见过了
I think you've met.

823
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,700
队友们 你们好啊
Hey, team, how's things?

824
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:33,540
泰拉 他对你做了什么
Terra, what did he do to you?

825
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:36,880
没什么我已经问了很多次
Nothing. And I've asked a bunch of times.

826
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,910
泰拉是我安插在你们队伍里
Terra was a key part of my plan.

827
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:41,910
的间谍
A natural double agent.

828
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,550
这不可能是真的
That can't be true.

829
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:45,580
就像我说的
What can I tell you, Goldilocks.

830
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:47,850
有得必有失去
You win some, you lose some.

831
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:48,920
我们视你为队友
We took you in.

832
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,190
诚心诚意帮助你
Helped you.

833
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:52,020
那就谢谢了
Yeah, well, thanks.

834
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:53,590
你们就等死吧
Now you're gonna die.

835
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:58,530
我还真有点不忍心啊
Geez, not a lot of gray area there, huh.

836
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:05,600
泰拉
Terra...

837
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,650
这地方让我想起了我父母的教会
Place reminds me of my parents' church.

838
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:48,150
一堆疯子
Bunch of crazies.

839
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:49,650
不知天高地厚的蝼蚁
Insolent trash.

840
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:51,750
你管谁叫蝼蚁
Who you calling trash?

841
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:53,950
冷静
Keep it together.

842
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,520
对我们的客人礼貌点
Let's be civil to our guests.

843
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:02,490
契约还没有完成
Our business is not yet complete.

844
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,500
没有完成
Sure it is.

845
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,430
你想要泰坦 我把他们带来
You wanted the Titans, and here they are.

846
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:09,270
不是全部
Not all of them.

847
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:11,340
少了夜翼
Not Nightwing.

848
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:14,110
这破坏了机器的平衡
It ruins the machine's symmetry.

849
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:17,410
死亡是不可避免的
We agreed some deaths might be unavoidable.

850
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:18,610
你要明白
Things happen.

851
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:20,310
我知道
I accept that.

852
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:23,820
而我也告诉过你
But I told you even in death there is life to be drawn.

853
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:27,520
尸体同样有用
Where is the body? Unless you have a body, you're one short.

854
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:33,230
所以我们的合同还不完整
Therefore, our contract is not complete.

855
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:37,900
幸运的是 我们还有备胎
Happily there is still a path to the salvation of our deal.

856
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,100
不是吗
Don't you agree?

857
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,900
很好
Excellent.

858
01:05:44,910 --> 01:05:46,140
动手
Mayhem.

859
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,110
泰拉
Terra!

860
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,190
我要索要更多的报酬
I should have charged more.

861
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:07,860
有了她的力量 你犹如虎添翼
With her powers, you're getting an upgrade.

862
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,470
阿门
Amen.

863
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:20,740
现在 我们的契约已经完成
Now, our business is complete.

864
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:28,580
斯莱德 救我
Slade, help me.

865
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:36,590
对不起 孩子 生意就是生意
Sorry, kid. But a contract is a contract.

866
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:38,890
你会付出代价
You'll pay for this.

867
01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:41,630
哦 甜心我也舍不得你
Oh, it's a shame you have to go, sweet cheeks.

868
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:44,030
我们相爱彼此
We would have been fantastic lovers.

869
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:46,930
我们对彼此一见钟情
You know, since we're both newly single.

870
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:57,910
开始
Let it begin!

871
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:28,310
你认为你是神吗 血兄弟
You think yourself a holy man, blood?

872
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:29,570
你只是个小人
You're filth.

873
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:31,410
缄口 罪人
Take heart, sinner.

874
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:34,910
你们将名垂青史
You are about to become part of the greater good.

875
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:37,380
要我们教你怎么成名吗
We're gonna show you the greater good.

876
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:39,320
就是踢你的屁股
By kicking your ass.

877
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:49,960
丧钟 上帝不会饶恕你的
No god is going to save you, Deathstroke.

878
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:53,870
血兄弟
Word to the wise, blood,

879
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:56,840
你要对他们做什么 快点做
whatever you're gonna do to them, do it quickly.

880
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:21,430
感觉不舒服
Not feeling so good.

881
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:26,030
他们罪有应得
I consider their pain a retribution for their sins against me.

882
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:27,930
对
Right.

883
01:08:28,570 --> 01:08:30,200
你高兴就好
Have a nice day.

884
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:35,910
先别急着走 等这个环节过了再说
Oh, don't leave now, brother. Everyone stays for this part.

885
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:38,910
什么环节 血兄弟
What part is that, brother?

886
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:46,580
当他们的力量助我成神时
When their powers are transferred and I ascend to god state.

887
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:52,920
血弟兄们 圣光即将降临
Hail me, brethren, for the moment of ascendency has arrived.

888
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:56,090
万岁 血兄弟 万岁 万岁
Hail, brother blood. Hail, hail.

889
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:59,360
万岁 万岁万岁
Hail, brother blood. Hail, hail.

890
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:00,970
兄弟血会万岁 万岁
Hail, brother blood. Hail...

891
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:06,470
没错我的子民们  你们将见证我…
Yes, my children, this vessel shall now transform me...

892
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:10,210
成神之…
And you are witness.

893
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:12,740
血兄弟 万岁 万岁 万岁
Hail, brother blood. Hail, hail.

894
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:16,180
我感到
I feel it.

895
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:18,720
爽
Yes!

896
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:22,490
我即将成神
My godhood is nearly complete.

897
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:24,820
赞美他
Praise him.

898
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:28,590
血兄弟万岁
All hail brother blood.

899
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,300
万岁 万岁
Hail, hail.

900
01:09:39,410 --> 01:09:40,940
爽…
Yes...

901
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:24,280
我知道你会来的
I knew you'd come.

902
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:01,250
嗨 老大爷 这是你的
Hey, papa, here's your pipe.

903
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:09,960
不要感谢我
Save some for me.

904
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:09,910
你们就不明白我是天命之子吗
Don't you know, I am the chosen?

905
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:13,550
你们不知道 我是神…
Don't you know, I am divine...

906
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:28,000
我会杀了你
I'm gonna kill you.

907
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:36,610
你在利用我 不是吗
I was being studied, like all the rest, wasn't I?

908
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:39,680
你从一开始就计划这个权利
You planned this right from the start.

909
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,050
冷静下来
Calm down.

910
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:43,650
我的爱 不是你想的这样
This is all a big misunderstanding, love.

911
01:13:43,650 --> 01:13:45,080
泰拉 不
Terra, no.

912
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:00,670
哦哦 该死
Oh, shit.

913
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,110
你这个异教徒
You heathen brats.

914
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:09,610
你毁了我的圣殿
You've destroyed my holy temple.

915
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:18,550
你夺走了我的神力
You've robbed me of my destiny.

916
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:20,180
我要杀了你
You will die.

917
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:24,690
你不会伤害…
You cannot harm...

918
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:37,400
不 滚开
No, you stay away from me.

919
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:39,900
你们这些恶魔
You demon filth.

920
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:41,340
他们不是恶魔
They're not demons.

921
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:42,770
我才是
Let me show you one.

922
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,650
什么鬼
What the hell?

923
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:26,880
我准备了这么久
I planned so long.

924
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:30,660
我是神 你们不明白吗
I was destined, can't you see?

925
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:33,690
我恳求你
Please, I beseech you.

926
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:36,530
以血兄弟的名义
I am blood.

927
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:37,730
我…
I...

928
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:42,770
我是…
I am...

929
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:47,310
原谅我
Saved.

930
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:51,480
我不会让他们抓住你的 我的爱
I won't let them cage you, my love.

931
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:53,850
快走
Come on.

932
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:41,760
孩子 再见
So long, kid.

933
01:16:57,810 --> 01:16:58,880
泰拉…
Terra...

934
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:02,850
对不起
I'm sorry.

935
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:06,180
不 泰拉…
No, Terra...

936
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:31,210
- 不要…  - 我们必须离开这里
- No...  - We have to go. The place is gonna collapse.

937
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:32,540
泰拉
Terra!

938
01:17:54,330 --> 01:17:57,870
可以问你个问题吗 你怎么会成为一个泰坦呢
So, let me ask you this, man, how do you become a titan exactly?

939
01:17:57,870 --> 01:18:00,840
我的意思是 有没有试镜什么的
I mean, is there an audition? Do you look at videos?

940
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:03,510
我能不能成为一个泰坦
'Cause I've been working out, you know, I want in.

941
01:18:03,510 --> 01:18:06,780
凯文 对我泰坦们泰坦来说
Well, Kev, I guess the most important thing to being a titan,

942
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:09,410
家庭最重要
is to have a strong sense of family.

943
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:15,990
有时我们也会因为性格不合
Some of us don't have our own, so, we support the ones that do.

944
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:41,980
而伤害彼此
Of course, an outgoing personality does hurt but, you know,

945
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:43,210
但你有超能力诶
you gotta have a power.

946
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:45,180
是挺帅的
Something cool.

947
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:48,820
帅 伙计你可以变身为动物 这也太酷炫了
Something cool? Listen, you turn into animals, man, that's beyond cool.

948
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:49,800
谢谢
Thanks.

949
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,490
这个能力不是来耍酷的
But, it's not just about the cool super powers,

950
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:55,390
穿上制服我们不能为所欲为
snazzy uniforms and daring adventures.

951
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:58,560
它使我们变得
It's about us helping each other grow.

952
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,360
更好
Be better people.

953
01:19:07,870 --> 01:19:12,280
我知道你不想谈论队伍里的人 但我还是忍不住
Listen, I know you're not supposed to talk about this, but I just gotta ask.

954
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,710
想问问那个女孩
There's a new girl, right?

955
01:19:14,710 --> 01:19:18,350
她对我们来说意义非凡
All I can say is that she's a wonderful addition to the team.

956
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:21,690
- 继续说  - 星火会杀了我的
- Come on, gar...  - Starfire would kill me.

957
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:25,490
这事就你知我知
There's no way Starfire is listening to this, man, she's brushing her hair.

958
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:32,260
不要 没门
Forget it. My lips are sealed.

959
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:35,630
他变成了只海豹
Whoa, man, he just turned into a seal, folks, I swear.

960
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,940
但是 加尔 她代替了土石女的位置吗
But really, gar, is she gonna, like, replace Terra?

961
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:41,140
泰拉
Terra?

962
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:44,040
是的 你应该知道很多关于她的故事
Yeah, you know, there are lots of stories about her.

963
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:45,710
我知道
I know.

964
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,350
哦 太好了
Ooh, too soon?

965
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:51,320
是啊
Yeah.

966
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,850
我不是这个意思 如果你不想…
I mean, that's cool honestly, if you don't wanna...

967
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:55,350
但是 我想说…
But, I'd like to say something...

968
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:58,520
很多人幻想过一个完美的人生
There are a lot of people who've been handed a rough life.

969
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,960
他们没有什么需求 但…
They never asked for it, but...

970
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:03,130
他们尽其所能
They do what they can.

971
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,570
他们害怕被伤害
Many of them can't rise above the hurt.

972
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:08,970
但这太难了
It's just too hard.

973
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:14,440
但是最后 一切轰然倒塌时
But in the end, when the chips were down,

974
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,810
她找到了自我
and she finally showed her true self,

975
01:20:20,610 --> 01:20:23,810
泰拉马科夫是我见过的
Terra Markov was like a diamond.

976
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:26,720
最伟大的人
Most beautiful thing that I'd ever seen.

977
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:52,050
后续彩蛋 请勿走开

978
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:53,660
就如我所说
I talk to the dead.

979
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:55,660
死亡不是终结
For no matter how rotted the corpse,

980
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:59,200
一切才刚刚开始
there's always a tiny wisp of life left.
