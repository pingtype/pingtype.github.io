别以为这样就不会召你入伍了

00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,780
母亲：他甚至害死了你(此明信片请勿流通)

140
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,060
你为什么写这种字体
Why are you writing like that?

141

我是掩盖我的笔迹

262
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,750
这就够了

他可以这么做 但他不会
Oh, yes, he can, but he won't

268
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:49,100
因为他是个警督 不是恶人
Because he's a police counsellor and not a monster

269
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,630
我相信这位先生没拿走
I'm sure this gentleman didn't take

270
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,930
任何不属于他的东西
anything that doesn't belong to him

271
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:54,570
因为他清楚这样会意味着什么
because he knows exactly what that would mean

272
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,370
因此他离开这里之后
So, he will do what he does best

273
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:58,640
会做他所擅长的

他会回到他的公寓

287
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,360
我需要手套 薄手套
I need gloves. Thin gloves

288
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,530
抱歉 本店不卖手套
Sorry, we don't have any

289
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:15,130
你可以去…
You might find some.

290
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,700
我想想 也许你可以去…
Let me think Maybe you'll find them...

291
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,900
不用 没关系
no, no, it's fine

292
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:21,170
这些就够了 谢谢
Just these. Thank you

293
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,890
- 再见  - 再见
- Goodbye  - Goodbye

294
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,000
停止战争机器

295
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,820
你听“希特勒的阴影笼罩欧洲
Listen, "Hitler's shadow falls over Europe

296
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,490
“就像魔鬼的阴影
"like the devil's shadow

297
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:15,400
传递这张卡片 打倒希特勒政权”
Pass this card on Down with the Hitler regime."

298
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,930
这字真难看 我女儿的字都比这个强
What a scrawl! Even my daughter writes better than that

299
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,330
是吗
Oh, yes?

300
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,100
在我看来 他是个很愚蠢的人
If you ask me, he is an incredibly stupid person

301
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,570
是个来自下层阶级
Someone from the lower classes

302
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,470
靠双手劳动的人
who works with their hands

303
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:29,440
可能能力不行 但不会愚蠢
Perhaps unskilled, but stupid? No

304
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,340
可能只是个人在发泄
Probably someone just letting off steam

305
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:33,350
只是一时冲动
Just a flash in the pan

306
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,520
还有别的卡片？
There is more?

307
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,520
母亲 元首害死了我儿子
"Mother The fuhrer murdered my son

308
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:47,030
母亲 元首也会害死你的孩子们
Mother. The fuhrer will murder your sons, too."

309
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,160
在哪儿
Where?

310
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,900
在国王大街 两周前
Neue Konigstrasse Two weeks ago

311
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,200
也是一个办公大楼里
Another office building

312
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,730
肮脏
Filth

313
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,300
我们怎么办 上报？
So what do we do now? Report it?

314
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,340
要不是警力不足 这本来不算什么
If we had more men, it wouldn't be a problem

315
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:03,180
我们很快就能抓住这个…该怎么称呼
We would catch this, uh, uh, how shall we call him?

316
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,810
这个淘气鬼
"Hobgoblin," in no time

317
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:15,690
我会在这两周里
I'd investigate everyone in Berlin

318
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:18,260
已经调查过柏林所有失去一个儿子的人
who has lost a son within the last two weeks

319
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,330
为什么
Why?

320
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,260
“元首害死了我的儿子”
"The fuhrer murdered my son."

321
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:24,160
- 只提到一个儿子  - 然后呢
- There's only one son  - And?

322
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,770
我们等待 收集线索
We wait We collect information

323
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,700
加以分析 我们就是吃这碗饭的
Put it together That is our job

324
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,840
我们是德国的专家 不是外行
We're German professionals Not amateurs

325
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,010
如果他继续干下去
What if he goes on doing it

326
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:35,740
却不再有卡片上交呢
and no more cards are turned in?

327
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,110
谁知道这件事发生多久了
Who knows how long this has been going on

328
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,980
想想在公共场所
Think what it would be like to touch

329
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,680
捡起这种卡片念
one of these cards in a public place

330
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,050
会是什么感觉
To stand there, to read it

331
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:44,880
知道可能有人正在监视你
Knowing somebody might be watching you

332
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:46,750
等着记录你的反应
waiting to record your response

333
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,920
这些淘气鬼写的卡片
No, whatever our hobgoblin writes

334
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,030
最后都会送到我们这里来
it's going to end up here with us

335
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:55,030
我估计能有百分之九十五
Let's say... 95 percent

336
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,660
我觉得不到
I say it's less

337
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,900
敢打赌吗
It's a bet?

338
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:08,070
那我们等着
So we wait

339
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,910
等待此人露出马脚
We wait for our friend to make a mistake

340
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:16,450
希特勒不会占上风 正义才有力量

341
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,410
早上好
Good morning

342
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,760
- 请进  - 谢谢
- Please come in  - Thank you

343
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,340
- 希特勒万岁  - 希特勒万岁
- Heil Hitler!  - Heil Hitler!

344
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:28,680
你是来自纳粹妇联的？我亲爱的夫人
So, you're from the Nazi women's league, my dear Frau?

345
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,380
我让女佣把我的钱包拿来
I'll just have the girl bring me my purse

346
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:33,250
我不是来募捐的 格里奇夫人
I'm not here for a donation, Frau Gehrich

347
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:34,420
完全不是
Definitely not

348
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,920
那你到底有什么事
So, what exactly can I do for you?

349
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:38,360
你为什么没去工作
Why aren't you at work?

350
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,730
你没看到我们的军工厂征召工人吗
Didn't you read our arms industry's calls for help?

351
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:41,990
看看我
Look at me

352
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,400
看我像是能干体力劳动的人吗
Do I look as if I'm suited to manual labor?

353
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:47,270
你试过一次吗
Have you ever tried?

354
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,670
我不打算损害我的健康
I'm not about to jeopardize my health

355
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:53,940
反正我总能搞到一张医疗诊断书
Anyway, I can always get a medical certificate

356
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,840
你当然可以 你可以花二十马克
Of course you can, you can buy one for 20 marks

357
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,910
从私人医生那里买到
from your personal physician

358
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:58,140
但这次没用了
but that won't help you in this case

359
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:00,110
这次你需要军工厂的医生开证明
In this case, you need a doctor from a factory

360
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:01,810
证明你没有工作能力
to certify that you are unable to work

361
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,520
我们指派给你的医生
A doctor that we assign to you

362
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,820
好吧 给我指派个医生 你能看到结果是什么
Alright, sign me a doctor and you'll see what happens

363
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,350
你是在嘲笑我和妇联吗
You're mocking me and the women's league?

364
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,660
嘲笑我们的制度和元首吗
Making fun of our regulations and our fuhrer?

365
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,490
- 我警告你  - 我也警告你
- I warn you  - and I warn you

366
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:15,330
你看来不知道老娘是谁
You don't seem to know who I am!

367
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:17,230
我丈夫是中校
My husband is Obersturmbannfuhrer!

368
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:19,970
这就更严重了 中校夫人
That makes it even worse, Frau Obersturmbannfuhrer

369
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,240
我们还会联系你的
You'll hear from us

370
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,270
除非你还有别的重要信息
Unless you have any more significant information?

371
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:28,810
比如有个生病的母亲
An ill mother, perhaps?

372
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:31,080
你的身份证和你的姓名马上交出来
Your ID and your name At once!

373
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,250
我保证你不会有好果子吃
I promise you, there will be consequences

374
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:35,480
拿去
Here you are

375
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,980
我没有名片
I don't have any calling cards.

376
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:39,550
因为我只是个普通工人
Because I'm just a common worker

377
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,360
希特勒万岁
Heil Hitler

378
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:56,770
不 我不明白
No, I don't understand

379
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:59,240
那女人在劳务责任法的管辖范围内
That woman comes under the labor service duty law

380
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,770
这一点你很清楚
And you know that as well as I do

381
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,440
格里奇夫人是一位中校的老婆
Frau Gehrich is the wife of an Obersturmbannfuhrer

382
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,740
那么你肯定明白…
So, I'm sure you understand that...

383
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:06,380
上面哪一条说这种女人
well, where does it say that women like that

384
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:08,080
可以免除劳动职责
are exempt from general duties?

385
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,680
- 哪一条？ - 别这么顽固
- Where?  - Oh, don't be so obstinate

386
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:13,450
她需要照顾她劳累工作的丈夫
She has to look after her overworked husband

387
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:14,750
我也一样
I do, too!

388
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,460
而且我看到那女人有女佣
And from what I saw, that woman has domestic help

389
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:20,830
我没做错什么
I didn't do anything wrong

390
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:23,100
我是按我们的规章办事
I acted according to our regulations

391
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:26,730
那么你会去道歉吗 昆格尔夫人
So, are you going to apologize, Frau Quangel?

392
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:29,140
为什么道歉
What for?

393
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:32,310
那我去代你道歉
Then I will do it, on your behalf

394
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:34,940
另外 你休息一段时间
And you, you take some time off

395
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,110
你们要开除我就因为
Oh, you're throwing me out, because I told

396
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:37,540
我对那种女人说了实话？
a woman like that the truth?

397
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:40,780
- 不是  - 不是 你误会我了
- No...  - Oh, no, you misunderstood me

398
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:44,180
只是休息几天
Just take some time off and rest

399
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:46,420
恢复你的体力
Gather your strength

400
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,890
这很重要 安娜
That's important, Anna

401
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:51,560
在刚丧子的这段时间
At a time of mourning

402
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,160
好吗
Alright?

403
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:57,660
好吧
Alright

404
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,000
希特勒万岁
Heil Hitler!

405
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,760
- 希特勒万岁  - 希特勒万岁 昆格尔先生
- Heil Hitler  - Heil Hitler, Herr Quangel

406
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,240
祝你万事如意 安娜
And all the best for you, Anna

407
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,450
谢天谢地
Thank god

408
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:21,490
- 不需要去妇联了  - 干得好
- No more women's league  - Well done

409
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:23,820
你怎么这么镇定
How can you be so calm?

410
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:26,690
我看到手套时差点吓死了
I nearly died when I saw the gloves

411
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:28,930
手套 安娜 只是手套
Gloves, Anna. Just gloves

412
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:31,430
我们怎么办 奥托
What are we doing, Otto?

413
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:35,100
我们失去了儿子 别的人失去了…
We've lost our son Other people have lost.

414
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,700
可他们他们不…
But they, they don't.

415
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,010
这个体制 这个政权…
This system, this regime.

416
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:45,480
现在我感觉我们自由了
Now I feel that we're free

417
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,680
我是说
I mean.

418
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,180
解脱了 解脱了一切
Freed... From all of it

419
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:52,650
这就是我的感觉
This is how I feel

420
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:19,130
邪恶希特勒政府存在一天 就不会有和平

421
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:28,100
新闻自由 希特勒住手！

422
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:35,480
相信自己 别被希特勒左右

423
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:42,800
希特勒 暴力和不公正的代名词

424
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:47,000
从不带来和平

425
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:02,090
吕德里茨大街二十三号
Luderitz Strasse 23

It's a shelter for mothers and children, boy

430
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,910
我们进去不合适
So it's not suitable for us

431
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:07,850
喂 你在这儿干什么 你在干什么

你能帮帮我吗
Please, can you help me?

440
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,500
我找不到母亲和儿童用的防空洞了
I need to find the shelter for mothers and children

441
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:08,310
我迷路了 我女儿正在那里等我
I've lost my way. My daughter is waiting for me there

442
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,680
你肯定熟悉这里的路 拜托了

- 你说你女儿？ - 是的

- How old is she?  - She's only six years old

445
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:15,780
她说在防空洞里等我
Six. Waiting for me at the shelter, she said

446
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,120
现在她去了防空洞 我却没有
And now she's there and I am not

447
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,820
过两条街就到了
Yeah, in two blocks and you're there

448
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,450
现在安静了 别慌
It's calm now, calm down

449
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:21,790
那里的人会照顾她的
The people there will take care of her

450
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:25,060
我不慌 她肯定很害怕哭着
I'm, I'm sure she's frightened and crying.

451

- 你说两条街？ - 是的
- It's two blocks, you say?  - Yes

452
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:29,130
两条街后左拐 很好找
Two blocks and then left You can't miss it

453
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:54,550

454
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,520
希特勒万岁

455
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:02,390
督查 我看看这个人要干什么
Well, inspector, let's see what your filthy hack is up to

456
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,900
我听说他依然在你眼皮底下
I hear he's still scribbling away

457
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,160
散发卡片
right under your nose, huh?

458
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:06,800
希特勒万岁 上校
Heil Hitler, Standartenfuhrer

459
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:12,140
他不肯放弃 不过这也在意料之中
He won't give up It wasn't to be expected anyway

460
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:15,910
一个人能花一个半小时画这个
Someone who takes one and a half hours to draw that

461
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:17,110

462
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:18,680
- 我亲自试过  - 是嘛
- Tried it myself  - Oh, really?

463
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,050
但你放心 我总能查到罪犯
But rest assured, I always find my man

464
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:24,450
我们的“淘气鬼行动”…

465
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:27,050
- 淘气鬼？ - 是的

- 我喜欢这名字  - 那就好

469
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,100
这里最初没有卡片
There were no cards here at first

470
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,060
但现在他不想走太远
but now he doesn't want to travel so far

471
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:42,230
在他的居住地区留下了越来越多的卡片
and leaves more and more cards in his own neighborhood

472
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,900
希特勒万岁 上校

既然上交的就超过一百张
If more than a hundred cards were turned in here

483
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,800
你们这些笨蛋有没有想过
doesn't anyone of you wise asses ever think about how much filth

484
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,800
还有多少在外面流传

485
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,610
恕我直言 我们想一想人之常情
With due respect, let's think about human nature

486
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:21,140
没人会长时间的
No one holds on to these scribblings

487
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,170
留着这些卡片
longer than necessary...

488
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,980
告诉我是谁干的

英勇的斯大林格勒战役

493
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,630
要有人写出真相
Someone has to write the truth

494
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:42,630
揭穿这些谎言
with all of these lies.

495
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:50,100
你觉得我们的卡片最后去了哪里
What do you think happens to our cards?

496
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,810
你为何想知道
Why do you want to know?

497
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,540
我想知道别人看了是什么反应
I want to know how people react

498
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:01,180
有些人大概会害怕

499
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:04,250
害怕可能有人在监视他们捡起了卡片
Afraid that someone may have watched them pick up the card

500
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:09,660
有些人可能会把卡片放回去
Some will maybe put them back

501
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,090
有些人会上交

502
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:15,130
交给警察街道管理员
to policemen, block wardens

503
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:18,160
但他们也会看到我们的卡片
but our cards will also be read by them

504
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:20,230
这就像一台机器
It's like with a machine

505
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,640
齿轮中有一点沙子不会让机器停转
A little sand in the gears will not stop the machine.

506
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:30,240
但如果有个人不停的
But if a person throws a little more sand

507
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,510
往里扔沙子
and, and more.

508
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:36,920
发动机就开始断断续续的
The motor begins to stutter

509
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,920
流水线就会停下来
the assembly line stops

510
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:43,520
我在脑海中看到有很多人
In my mind I see lots of people

511
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,360
在向齿轮里扔沙子
throwing sand in the gears

512
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:48,830
你是个浪漫主义者 奥托·昆格尔
You are a romantic, Otto Quangel

513
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,330
我是个机械工

是的 这也是
Yeah, that, too

515
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,870
你才是浪漫主义者
You are the romantic

516
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,510
至少你以前是
At least, you used to be

517
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:05,310
什么我以前是？
What? I, I used to be?

518
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:08,680
毕竟是我先看到你的
Still, I saw you first

519
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,280
你是你先看到我
not the other way around

520
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,280
可你啥也没说
But you didn't say anything

521
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:16,890
你当时在和彼得·赖因克跳舞
You were dancing with Peter Reinke

522
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:19,530
然后你跟他去了栗子树下

523
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:22,390
你戴着花冠

524

笑着好像他多么风趣似的

525
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:28,500
赖因克和他那难看的发型

526
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:32,470
他现在是秃子了 也是党员

527
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:35,340
我本来也会跟你跳舞的

528
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:37,210
可你没请我
but you didn't ask

529
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:40,380
你能看出来我喜欢你
You knew the way I looked at you

530
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:43,720
总之我两年后请你了
Anyway, I asked you two years later

531
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:46,490
不是请我跳舞
Not to dance

532
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:19,790
你想跳舞？
So you'd like a dance?

533
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:25,160
不 只是…
No, just.

534
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:48,010
这是他吗 大致上
Is that him, approximately?

是的 差不多

你知道我今天是什么心情吗

588
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:27,870
你没考虑过吧
No. You don't think of that, do you?

589
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:29,140
发现你不在工厂
Finding you're not at work

590
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:30,580
然后想到你还在大楼里面

591
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:31,910
你知道我是什么心情吗

怎么了奥托 你想被抓住吗

593
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:35,010
是这样吗
Is that what it is?

594
01:06:43,490 --> 01:06:45,990
- 没出什么事  - 没出什么事？

你看到他们逮捕了谁吗

一个流氓 可能是偷了东西

跟我们没关系

他是我们的女邮递员的丈夫

599
01:06:55,670 --> 01:06:58,070
你怎么觉得跟我们没关系
What makes you think it has nothing to do with us?

600
01:06:58,070 --> 01:06:59,400
他们离婚了
They're divorced

601
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:03,410
这不能说明什么 真是的
That doesn't mean anything, damn it!

602
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,080
我很担心你
I was so afraid for you

603
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:10,550
如果这是个征兆是个警告呢

604
01:07:10,550 --> 01:07:11,750
这不是

605
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,020
镇定
Stay calm

606
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:25,030
记得汉斯死的时候

607
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:28,400
你说过你活着没什么价值吗
You said your life wasn't worth a thing?

608
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,470
你说的对
You were right

609
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:35,440
所以我们能解脱
That's why we can be free

610

所以我们能无所畏惧

611
01:07:37,310 --> 01:07:39,480
但你活着
But your life

612
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,680
奥托 你活着 对我来说有价值
Otto, your life means something to me now

613
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,080

对我来说 意味着一切
Everything to me now

615
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:52,490
我们说过我们一起干的
We said we'd do this together

616
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:54,360
哦
Oh.

617
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:57,460
- 我们不会罢手  - 你不怕吗
- We won't stop  - Aren't you afraid?

618
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:03,570
今天我又停下来观察
Today I stayed again to watch

619
01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:06,240
我需要看看别人看到卡片后的反应

620
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:32,230
来
Come

01:08:39,270 --> 01:08:41,910
我的疾病证明过期了

622
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:43,840
所以我去看医生
That's why I went to see the doctor

623
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:46,980
否则他们会送我去集中营 拜托了
They send me to a camp otherwise. Please!

624
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:48,480
我发誓
I swear

625
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:51,080
以我孩子们的生命发誓
by the lives of my children

626
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,320
- 拜托了  - 两个儿子？
- Please  - Two sons?

627
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,350
他们都是士兵吧
And they're both soldiers, right?

628
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:57,090
两个都是
Both of them. Yes

629
01:08:58,190 --> 01:09:01,360
其中一个甚至是武装党卫队的
One of them is even in the Waffen-ss

630
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:02,990
他们都还活着吧
And they're both alive, I hope?

631
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,760
是的 这里
Yes. Here

632
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:08,330
我的儿子卡尔 在波兰
Our Karl, in Poland

633
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:17,680
这是好消息
Well... That's good news

634
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:19,880
这人被当场抓住 有目击证人
So the man was caught red-handed. There are witnesses

635
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,080
而这就是罪证
And here, the Corpus Delicti

636
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,110
这显然是淘气鬼的字迹
It's obviously the writing of our hobgoblin

637
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,020
拜托 埃舍里希 我们抓到他了
Come on, Escherich We've got him

638
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:27,450
你也知道罪犯的特征 佐特
You know the criminal's profile as well as I do, Zott

639
01:09:27,450 --> 01:09:30,420
罪犯是个失去独子的机械工
We're looking for a mechanic who lost his only son

640
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:32,820
你却拖来了这个可笑的家伙
And then you drag in this ridiculous character

641
01:09:32,830 --> 01:09:34,290
一个赌徒
a gambler

642
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:36,830
而他甚至不住在我们的目标区域附近
who doesn't even live near our target area

643
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:38,930
还有两个活着的儿子
with two children who are very much alive

644
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:42,870
你的意思是 你相信我？
Does that, does that mean you believe me?

645
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:44,470
- 是的 你可以走了  - 谢谢 谢谢

You did what? You let your hobbygobby go?

650
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:01,720
是淘气鬼 上校
Hobgoblin, Standartenfuhrer

651
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:03,660
恕我直言
With due respect

652
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:06,560
你虽然是我的上级 但身为党卫队的成员
you may be my superior, but as a member of the ss

653
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,660
并不一定非要是刑事专家
you're not necessarily a criminalist

654
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:13,100
我是个警察 我请求你不要干涉我的调查
I'm a policeman, and I'm asking you to let me do my job

655
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:15,970
让我用我过去的经验
just as I have learned from my experience.

656
01:10:15,970 --> 01:10:17,270
经验？
Experience?

657
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:21,440
你这样的人我见的多了
I know all about guys like you

658
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,110
自作聪明的知识分子
Intellectuals, wise guys

659
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:26,040
别弄脏我的地板
Don't mess up my floor!

660
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:28,050
把你的血咽下去

661
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:33,620
起来 起来 来 起来
Up! Up, up, up, up, up! Come. Up

662
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:38,160
你以为你聪明？
You think you're clever, huh?

663
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,660
而我们都是党卫队的人
And we're just the guys from the ss

664
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:41,490
什么都不懂对吗
who don't have a clue, right?

665
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:44,760
说出来 我想听你说：我比你们聪明
Say it. I want to hear it I'm smarter than you guys

666
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:46,700

- 说 我听不见  - 对不起
- Say it! I can't hear you  - I'm sorry

668
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:50,840
什么
Huh?

669
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:54,870
限你两天时间
You have two days.

670
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:59,080
两天之内除掉那个你放走的人
Two days to eliminate the guy you let go

671
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,210
现在把他赶出去
Now, get rid of that thing!

672
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:22,860
昆格尔夫人？
Frau Quangel?

673
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:26,130
你是汉斯的母亲吧
You're Hans's mother, right?

674
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:28,730
- 是的  - 我是迪特里希

675

我是汉斯的同学
I was one of Hans's classmates

676
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,140
迪特里希 对

677
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:34,610
你好吗
How are you?

我很好 谢谢你 我还活着
Fine. Thank you Well, I'm alive

679
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,280
很高兴你从战场回来了
I'm glad you've come back

680
01:12:42,410 --> 01:12:45,580
- 内克尔先生  - 对不起 我得走了
- Herr Necker?  - Excuse me, I have to go

681
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:52,120
昆格尔夫人 我…
You know, Frau Quangel, I.

682
01:12:52,130 --> 01:12:53,720
我很怀念汉斯
I miss Hans a lot

683
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:22,490
我和恩诺已经没什么关系了
I have nothing to do with Enno anymore

684
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:27,560
他已经很久不是我丈夫了
He hasn't been my husband for a long time

685
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:28,590
上帝作证
before god

686
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:37,440
现在
Now.

687
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:41,740
谈到哪儿了 对了
Where were we? Yes

688
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:42,870
你正要告诉我
You were about to tell me

689
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,980
去哪儿能找到你的前夫
how to find that ex-husband of yours

690
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:10,900
你一直都藏在这里？
So here you've been hiding?

691
01:14:14,010 --> 01:14:15,910
我知道你跟卡片毫无关系 恩诺
I know you've nothing to do with the cards, Enno

692
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:17,440
这是好消息 督查
Oh, that's good news, inspector...

693
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,440
可党卫队的人认为就是你
but the guys from the ss think it was you

694
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:22,850
现在他们说了算
And I'm afraid they're in charge now

695
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:27,120
也管着我
In charge of me, too

696
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:32,690
他们会逮捕你 会审讯你
They will arrest you, they will interrogate you

697
01:14:32,690 --> 01:14:33,930
以他们的方式
in their own way

698
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:39,200
那我还不如死了
I'd rather be dead

699
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,130
你说的对
You're right

700
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,000
你还不如死了

- 呃  - 嘘

没关系 这样更好一些

703
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:15,300
- 不 求你  - 该死的

704
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:31,750
自杀？

705
01:15:33,190 --> 01:15:34,950
好消息 埃舍里希

谢谢你顶替弗里茨

快到了
It's getting closer

714
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,570
昆格尔工头机器过热了
Foreman Quangel, the machine is overheating

715
01:18:35,570 --> 01:18:37,100
关掉它

716
01:19:58,180 --> 01:20:00,180
你怎么不干活
Don't you have anything to do?

717
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:14,830
路德维格

这很严重
It's quite something

720
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:31,580
最好交给管理层

721
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:33,950
你是个党代表
You're a party representative

722
01:20:35,050 --> 01:20:38,520
你必须这么做按规矩办事

723
01:20:58,580 --> 01:20:59,580

霍德维克斯特和加布隆斯基特之间的附近
chodowieckistr and jablonskistr

728
01:21:21,970 --> 01:21:24,570
没人住在那个地址 督查
No, nobody with that address, inspector

729
01:21:26,770 --> 01:21:28,740
工头是谁 谁对工人最了解
Who is the foreman? Who knows his men best?

730
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:31,110
- 是弗里茨·肯帕  - 马上叫他来
- Well, that's Fritz Kemper  - Well, get him here at once

731
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:33,840

他的名字不在名单上
Well, his name is not in the list

735
01:21:39,350 --> 01:21:40,720
你不是说所有的人吗

736
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:43,320
对不起 他今天只是来帮忙
Sorry. Uh, he's just helping out today

737
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:45,120
当然 他不了解这些工人
Of course, he does not know the people

738
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,190
他住在哪儿

739
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:48,490

750
01:24:03,290 --> 01:24:05,300
别装蒜了 昆格尔

你是在数有多少吗

753
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:20,580
想想吧 昆格尔
Think about it, Quangel

754
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:24,520
每张卡片都是别人上交的
Every single card was voluntarily turned into us

755
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:25,720
主动上交

我们自己没找到一张

有的人被捕了 有一个自杀了

760
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:40,160
你凭什么相信

761
01:24:40,170 --> 01:24:42,000
你能改变什么
that you would change anything

762
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,740
昆格尔工头
you, foreman Quangel?

763
01:24:46,270 --> 01:24:47,970
- 谁自杀了  - 这不重要
- Who killed himself?  - It doesn't matter

764
01:24:47,970 --> 01:24:50,510
一个小人物无关紧要
A small fish. Insignificant

765
01:24:50,510 --> 01:24:52,510
每个人都重要

766
01:24:54,210 --> 01:24:56,850
- 这是我的错  - 这就对了

现在你认罪了

768

你准确的告诉我 昆格尔

769
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:06,390
你写了多少卡片

770
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:07,760

只有十八张卡片没被上交

774
01:25:24,110 --> 01:25:26,110
另外我们抓到了安娜
By the way, we have Anna

775
01:25:28,710 --> 01:25:31,720
那就放了她 这跟她没关系
Then let her go She has nothing to do with it

776
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:33,580
我知道你在撒谎 昆格尔
I know you are lying, Quangel

777
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:35,090
卡片内容是你老婆口述的
Your wife dictated what to write

778
01:25:35,090 --> 01:25:36,950
看我像是那种
Do I look like someone who would let his wife

779
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,960
听老婆口述的人吗
dictate things to him?

780
01:25:40,230 --> 01:25:42,360
一直都是我的主意
It was my idea from the beginning

781
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:45,800
都是我设计的 我自己携带出去
I thought it all up I carried it out by myself

782
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,100
她认罪了
She confessed

783
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,230
这是你撒谎了
Now you're lying

784
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:53,670
她认罪了 她不希望你独占功劳
She confessed. She didn't want you to get all the credit

785
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:01,650
我会签字认罪
I'll sign my confession

786
01:26:02,810 --> 01:26:05,820
不过 督查 安娜
but, inspector, Anna

787

请不要牵连
please, don't

788
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:16,190
没这个必要
It's, it's not necessary

789
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:30,440
派个记录员到我办公室来
Send a recording clerk to my office

790
01:26:49,690 --> 01:26:51,700
- 打扰一下长官  - 怎么了

791

为淘气鬼干杯
To the hobgoblin!

793
01:27:59,970 --> 01:28:00,970
昆格尔
Quangel

是改变不了的

797
01:29:46,510 --> 01:29:48,940
我知道 奥托
I know, Otto

798
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:53,780
这无所谓
It doesn't matter

799
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:57,850
