00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,800
滚开
Move!

4
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,760
先生 先生 给我回来
Hey, sir! Sir! Come back!

5
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,920
我得走了
I've gotta get outta here.

6
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,680
喂喂喂慢着
Boo, boo, boo, hey, hey, hey.

7
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,640
妹子 你带那张清单了吗？
Girl, you got that list of questions?

8
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,840
带辣
Yes.

9
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,810
我觉着我准备充足了
I think I have everything that I need.

10
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,600
你真该庆幸你没感染衣原体
Be happy you ain't got this chlamydia, all right?

11
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,960
哦 妹子 我之前试着尿尿来着
Ooh, girl, I tried to take a piss earlier,

12
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,160
尼玛感觉像有条恶龙在我逼里喷火啊
it was like there was an angry dragon inside my snatch,

13
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,120
你造吗 《权力的游戏》里那种龙啊
you know, like some Game of Thrones shit!

14
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,360
那真可怕 卡提莎
That's terrible, Kateesha.

15
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,120
但每次高大帅的壮哥哥来蹭我这肥臀
I can't help it when a tall, athletic brother

16
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,560
我就忍不住咯
come pushing up on this thickness.

17
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,440
耶 啊疼
Ooh, yeah... Oh, shit!

18
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,080
天啊妹子 我他妈每一天都在庆幸
Oh, God, girl, I thank God every motherfucking day

19
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,760
“超音速”小哥搬去俄州了
that the SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma. Shit.

20
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,920
好吧 我真得走了 不然要赶不上你的采访
Okay, I'm gonna go so I won't be late for your interview.

21
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,570
你他妈穿的啥啊？
What the fuck are you wearing, girl?

22
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,320
没有迷彩 没有网袜 连一点糖果色都没有？
There ain't no camouflage, no fishnets and no fluorescent colors.

23
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,320
你觉得你躲在暗处有人能看到你吗 小婊咂？
How they gonna see you in the dark, bitch? How they gonna see you?

24
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,240
我真的得走了
I gotta go.

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,760
真气派
Wow, so big.

26
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,450
哦 不好意思
Oh, I'm sorry.

27
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,200
你要是在找流浪汉之家的话 你得下两层楼
If you're looking for the homeless shelter, it's two doors down.

28
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,240
不…不是的 我是汉娜・斯蒂尔
Oh, no, I'm... I'm Hannah Steale.

29
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,520
我来见布莱克先生
I'm here to see Mr. Black.

30
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,760
你就是那个大学生妹子啊 外套给我吧？
The college bitch. May I take your coat?

31
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,280
好 谢谢你
Yes, please. Thank you.

32
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,560
恶…
Ew...

33
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,680
跟我来
Follow me.

34
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,800
温馨提示
In case you're wondering,

35
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,840
我就是操过老板的性感小秘书
I'm the hot secretary who's fucking the boss,

36
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,840
意思就是说 你这种新来的蠢萌实习生没机会的
which means there's no room for the dopey intern

37
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,280
更何况你这一头油毛和肥大腿
with the damaged hair and the cankles.

38
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,080
过来
Come here.

39
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,240
呃
Ugh!

40
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,650
他吃完午饭 打完壁球后…
That's the smell of his balls...

41
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,680
…的蛋蛋就是这个味道
...after lunch and two games of racquetball.

42
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,680
嗯…
Mmm...

43
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,280
祝你一天愉快 斯蒂尔小姐
Have a nice day, Ms. Steale.

44
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,850
屁股平平小婊咂
Plain-ass bitch.

45
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,040
啊 我的脖子 疼 哦
Ow! My neck. Ow. Ooh.

46
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,040
你…
You...

47
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,080
噢噢噢噢卧槽
Oh, shit!

48
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,520
我刚才应该刹车的
I guess I should've tried pulling.

49
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,680
卡文海尔纳小姐
Ms. Kavahellnah.

50
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,840
我是克里斯蒂安・布莱克
Christian Black.

51
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,040
你没事吧
Are you okay?

52
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,280
啊 我觉得没事
I think so, yeah.

53
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,520
很好 因为你他妈糟透辣
Good, 'cause you got fucked up!

54
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,600
我是说 你跟头发疯犀牛一样撞上那个雕塑
I mean, you hit that statue like a hard-charging rhino,

55
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,480
我之所以说犀牛是因为你真是够肥的
and I say rhino because you're a lot fatter than I thought,

56
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,600
而且你鼻子上那个痘痘 看起来就像是个小犀牛角
and you got this bump on your nose that resembles a small horn.

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,490
- 要不你还是挤掉吧  - 好的
- Maybe you wanna get that squeezed. - Okay.

58
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,080
对付痘痘就得主动出击
A little Proactive on it.

59
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,930
我不是什么卡文海尔纳
I'm not Ms. Kavahellnah.

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,490
你不是卡文海尔纳？
You ain't Ms. Kavahellnah?

61
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,400
- 那你他妈是谁？ - 我叫汉娜・斯蒂尔
- Who the fuck are you? - My name is Hannah Steale.

62
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,970
我和卡提莎
I'm studying literature

63
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,920
都是文学系的大学生
with Kateesha at the university.

64
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
欧
Oh.

65
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,200
那请坐
Please, have a seat.

66
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,770
- 谢谢  - 别客气
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

67
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
不是
No.

68
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,400
- 不是  - 那你要啥啊？
- No. - So, what do you want?

69
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,600
老天 直接说出来
Jesus Christ! Just spit it out!

70
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,850
铅笔
A pencil.

71
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,960
铅笔…你怎么不早说
A pencil...You should've just said that in the beginning!

72
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,440
老天 给 拿去
Gosh! Here, take 'em!

73
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,960
- 老天爷  - 谢谢你
- Jesus! - Thank you.

74
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,080
你最好给我打起精神来 斯蒂尔小姐
You gotta get your shit together, Ms. Steale.

75
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,520
操…
Shit...

76
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,250
这些是卡提莎写的问题
These are Kateesha's questions, okay?

77
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,320
“你有很多钱”
"You have mad stacks of cash."

78
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,600
“你怎么挣到的 能不能分我一点”
"How'd you get it, and can I get some?"

79
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,360
哦…斯蒂尔小姐
Oh...Ms. Steale.

80
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,560
我挣钱的法子
I got my money

81
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,840
和大多数黑人企业家一样
the way most black entrepreneurs got theirs.

82
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,400
- 房地产？ - 贩毒啦
- Real estate? - Drug dealing.

83
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,040
瞧 你首先得把整件事了解清楚
See, you have to know your business inside and out.

84
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,200
我吸过一阵子可卡因 没吸多久
I smoked crack. Not for long,

85
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,000
刚好吸到我知道鸡鸡尝起来什么味
but just long enough to know what a penis tastes like.

86
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,480
味道和烤牛臀差不多
Tastes like raw rump roast.

87
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,210
- 嗯  - 恶
- Mmm. - Ew!

88
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,640
我当时全身发灰 像个外星人一样
I got all ashy, like E.T. when he was sick in the river.

89
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,170
掉了六颗牙
I lost six essential teeth.

90
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,120
你有没有试过只用一颗臼齿吃牛排？
Have you ever tried to eat steak with one molar?

91
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,520
没 我干嘛要那样？
No. Why would I do that?

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,120
边吸边啃
Gnaw and suck.

93
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,240
一点点边吸边啃 很痛苦的
Gnaw and suck. It's hard.

94
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,480
- 那你熬过来大概是幸运吧  - 不
- Could be that you're lucky. - No.

95
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,800
[美国演员]
基努・里维斯才幸运
Keanu Reeves is lucky.

96
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,560
[美国嘻哈歌手]
弗罗・里达才幸运
Flo Rida is lucky.

97
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,920
[澳大利亚饶舌歌手]
伊基・阿塞利亚才幸运
Iggy Azalea is lucky.

98
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,920
是啊 他真幸运
Yeah, he's lucky.

99
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,200
那下个问题
Next question.

100
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,320
“你是有点基 还是他妈基到爆炸？”
"Is you gay, or is you gay as a motherfucker?"

101
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,640
你摸过别人鸡鸡并不能代表你是基佬
Just because you touch a penis doesn't mean you're gay.

102
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,240
尤其是为了钱或者可卡因
Especially if it's for money or crack.

103
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,400
只有你喜欢去摸别人鸡鸡才能说明你是基佬
You're only gay if you enjoy touching penis.

104
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,200
我摸别人鸡鸡的时候想着…“老子不喜欢这么干”
You touch a penis with attitude, like..."I don't really like this."

105
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,360
那不能被称作基 而是有探索精神
That ain't gay. It's just exploratory.

106
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,320
我记得你说你主修英语
You said you're an English major.

107
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,720
[分别为英国文学之父、英国浪漫主义诗人和英国诗作家]
那你是因为乔叟 雪莱还是济慈的作品
Was it Chaucer, Shelley or Keats

108
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,880
才爱上文学的呢？
that first made you fall in love with literature?

109
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,320
[美国儿童文学家]
- 是苏斯  - 苏斯啊
- It was Seuss. - Seuss!

110
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,050
-“ 戴帽子的猫 小孩一号和小孩二号” -“ …和小孩二号”
- "Cat in the Hat, Thing 1 and Thing 2." - "...and Thing 2!"

111
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,200
谁不想当那俩娃啊？
I mean, who doesn't wanna be them?

112
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,320
告诉你 今年万圣节 我和我弟弟
Well, you know, me and my brother were Thing 1

113
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,920
就打扮成了他们俩
and Thing 2 for Halloween this year.

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
- 真的？ - 是啊 你看
- Really? - Yeah. Check this out.

115
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,160
啊天呐 看看你们俩
Oh, my God, look at both of you!

116
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,280
我们自称逼崽子一号和逼崽子二号
We called 'em Thang 1 and Thang 2.

117
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,840
真有意思
That's amazing.

118
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,520
如果我想雇你怎么办？
What if I wanted to hire you?

119
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,890
不好说 我看到那些打扮妖艳的女人
I don't know. I see the way the women dress around here.

120
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,690
我觉得这儿并不适合我
I don't exactly fit in.

121
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,760
你看 除了你那low逼毛衣
You know, despite the Salvation Army sweater,

122
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,330
油光发亮的头毛
the greasy weaves,

123
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,400
还有你那个比亚瑟小子都大的鼻子
and your big ol' Usher nose,

124
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,920
你居然有种反常的美感
there's something oddly attractive about you.

125
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,160
恩 你就是个小丑逼
Yeah, you're like the little ugly runt

126
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,960
在一堆可爱小狗中间的小丑逼
in a litter full of pretty puppies.

127
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,280
那种没人愿意摸的丑逼小狗
You know, the little ugly one that nobody wants to touch.

128
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,800
没毛大眼 长相狂野的丑逼小狗
You're, all hairless and big-eyed and wild-looking.

129
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,690
但就是让人想带回家 好好爱抚一番
But you just wanna take you home and give you love,

130
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
或者把你捆上石头
or stuff you in a sack with a bunch of rocks

131
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,400
直接沉大海
and just toss your little ugly ass at the bottom of the ocean.

132
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,760
了结你的痛苦
Just put you out your misery.

133
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,440
欧 行
Oh. Okay.

134
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,720
谢谢你 布莱克先生
Thank you, Mr. Black.

135
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,000
别 叫我克里斯蒂安就好

Yeah, I guess if you're into the wildly-successful,

170
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,400
超级帅气 还可能有点儿危险的人
super-handsome, possibly-dangerous thing,

171
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,360
那克里斯蒂安・布莱克就是你的菜

Ooh, I wish I could find a man the size of this to satisfy me.

179

我可能会把你当做连环杀手啥的

别扯淡了 如果我是连环杀手
Don't be ridiculous. If I was a serial killer,

You're right. If you were my dog, I would do this.

543
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,920
好了 我有些东西
Okay, well, I got something

544
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,280
很想给你看看
I really wanna show you.

545
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,520
啊老天 不会又是一群傻逼老黑吧
Oh, my God. It's not more broke niggas, is it?

546
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,010
- 当然不是  - 无意冒犯
- No more broke niggas. - No offense.

547
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,810
别担心你鸡鸡内生长的阴毛
And don't worry about those ingrown hairs on your penis.

548
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,120
隔着裤子别人看不见
We can't see them through your pants.

549
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,800
别跟她认真 老兄
Don't give her all the dick, bro.

550
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,560
- 她不配  - 操一半就好啦
- She don't deserve it. - Half the dick.

551
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,840
那女人骂起你来简直飞天
Over there fucking Charles Barkley.

552
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,320
我操你妈 拜拜
Fuck this shit! I'm out!

553
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,120
拜托 斯蒂尔小姐 别这么老顽固
Please, Ms. Steale. Just keep an open mind.

554
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,520
挑逗用具
Tantalizing.

555
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,560
这是我奶奶传下来的
Got these from my grandma.

556
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,680
你真他妈变态
You're a sick motherfucker.

557
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,530
[美国演员，曾下药并强奸过三十五名女性]
不 比尔・科斯比才是变态
No, Bill Cosby's a sick motherfucker.

558
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,720
我只是与众不同而已
I'm just a dominant.

559
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,400
那跟我有什么关系？
What does that have to do with me?

560
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,400
我想要你通过性的方式把自己交给我
I want you to give yourself to me sexually.

561
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,280
所以才有那些鞭子 锁链 吓人的性玩具
Hence all the whips, chains and freaky sex toys.

562
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,840
那我又能得到什么呢？
And what would I get out of it?

563
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
老子啊
Me.

564
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,330
哦老天呐
Oh, my God!

565
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,330
- 呃 让我先想清楚  - 嗯哼
- Ooh. Let me get this straight. - Mmm-hmm.

566
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,490
所以你想用那些东西鞭打我…
So, you wanna beat me with these paddles...

567
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,520
- 鞭子  - 好多鞭子
- Whip. - Whips.

568
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,160
你想把我锁在这个架子上…
You wanna chain me to this rack...

569
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,040
诶…手铐
Eh...Handcuff.

570
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,360
然后用丧尽天良的办法羞辱我
And humiliate me in unimaginable ways,

571
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,880
作为交换
and in exchange for all this torture,

572
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,570
我就能得到你？
I get you?

573
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,200
一点儿没错
Yeah, that's correct.

574
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,840
这世上有女人愿意这么做？
And women go for this?

575
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,650
有一些辣
Some women.

576
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,210
- 这就像是成年人的迪士尼  - 没错儿
- It's like Disneyland for grown-ups. - Yeah.

577
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,040
所以 你怎么想？
So, what do you think?

578
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,560
我其实啥都能接受啊
I'm pretty much cool with anything,

579
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,000
只要你别告诉我爹我上了个黑人
as long as you promise you won't tell my dad I fucked a black guy.

580
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,160
你怎么想？
So, what do you think?

581
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,040
两件事 杯子在哪
Two things. Where's the cup,

582
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,840
我们何时能吃屎？
and when do we eat shit?

583
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,840
我们要在这干嘛？
What we supposed to do in here?

584
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,760
恩 我觉得我们应该从玩儿绳子开始
Well, I thought we'd start with a little bit of rope play.

585
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,520
不
No!

586
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,400
好吧 那要不直接上那边的架子 我骑你？
Okay, well, how about I just mount you to that rack over there and spank you?

587
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,120
骑你妈的拐弯屁
Hell to the no!

588
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,200
那鞭打怎么样？
Perhaps a little bit of flogging?

589
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,010
我都不知道你说的鞭打是什么意思
I don't even know what the hell flogging means,

590
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,120
所以打你妈的拐弯屁
so fuck to the no!

591
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,720
好吧 那你说我们该在这干嘛？
Okay, well, what are we supposed to do then?

592
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,480
你给老娘去见耶稣 你就该干这个
You need to find Jesus! That's what you can do.

593
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,120
好 现在情况是这样
Okay, here's how it goes.

594
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,720
我起草了一份标准合同 包含一些基础条目
I've drafted a standard contract that lays out the terms.

595
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,480
很多XX 我们还有更多XX
Lots of sex, we have more sex.

596
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,560
嘿咻嘿咻 我们以XX结束
Yadda-yadda, we end with sex.

597
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,010
你看一下 再跟我说说你想怎么样
You look it over, and you negotiate what you're willing to do.

598
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,400
我知道这么说
I hate to throw a monkey wrench

599
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,160
帮不上什么忙
into the whole works here,

600
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,480
但是我…
but I...

601
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,640
你没什么自信？
You have low self-esteem?

602
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,480
不是的 我…
No. I...

603
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,440
你有恋父情结
You have daddy issues.

604
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,160
不是
No.

605
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,320
我想说的是 我是…
What I'm trying to tell you is, I'm a...

606
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,250
- 处女？ - 没错
- A virgin? - Yeah.

607
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,440
卧槽 不敢相信
Man! I can't believe this!

608
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,480
我不明白
I don't understand!

609
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,410
好吧 你应该至少做过些啥吧
Okay, tell me you've done something.

610
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,600
口X？
Blowjob?

611
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,280
- 口X是X哪里啊？ - 手指爆X？
- Where does the blowing come in? - Finger pop?

612
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,520
- 没  - 没玩过愤怒的熊猫？
- No. - Angry panda?

613
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,120
- 他为什么要愤怒？ - 你为什么这么问？
- Why is it angry? - Why did you ask that?

614
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,840
我的天 好吧 你好歹应该肛X过了吧
Oh, my God! Okay, tell me you've done anal.

615
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,160
我了解这个
I know how it goes.

616
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,640
你让男人X你屁眼
You let guys put it in your little rusty bullet hole

617
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,520
这样你还是可以跟你妈妈或者牧师说你是处女
so you can tell your mama and your pastor that you're still a virgin.

618
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,250
我只是在等
I've just been waiting.

619
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,650
等什么？
For what?

620
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,000
妹子 你都二十好几了
Girl, you are 20-something years old!

621
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,800
这个又不是越酿越香 时间太久会坏掉的
It don't get no better. It's going to spoil!

622
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:02,560
然后就只能怀小孩了 只能怀小孩 明白？
It's fermenting down there. Just fermenting. Okay?

623
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,640
你告诉我 为什么没人X你
You gonna tell me nobody wanted the pussy?

624
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,880
恩 我对于X对象很挑剔的…
Well, I just am very selective about who I've wanted to...

625
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,040
挑剔？
Oh, selective?

626
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,440
这话听着像是一个没人要的丑婆子说的
Oh, that sound like something somebody with a pussy that nobody wanted would say.

627
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,400
- 喂  - 别会错意
- Hey. - Don't get me wrong.

628
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,290
我也不想去搞黑木耳
I don't want it all worn out like an old washing machine belt

629
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,640
她们的逼要么跟挂在车外的湿垫子一样没劲
or hanging like wet straps in a car wash

630
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,640
要么pia来pia去像个充气床垫
or flapping around like an inflatable figure outside of a mattress store.

631
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,000
但是你至少要有些经验
But I want it to have some experience.

632
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,360
好吧 这样
Okay, look.

633
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,360
我们现在就解决这个问题
We're gonna fix this situation. Right now.

634
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,840
我等这一刻等了一辈子了
I've been waiting my whole life for this.

635
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,240
来吧
Come on.

636
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,480
好
Yes!

637
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,400
呃…这很…
Oh...Very...

638
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,490
很有野人风范嘛
Very Sasquatch of you.

639
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,680
你从没和处女搞过吗？
Have you never had sex with a virgin before?

640
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,120
没和你这么有毛的处女搞过
Not a hairy one.

641
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,650
啊 你划到我了
Ow! You nicked me!

642
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,720
嘘…
Shh...

643
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,040
卧槽？
What the hell?

644
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,880
啊 对了 我肚脐眼外突
Oh, yeah, I have an outie.

645
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,160
哦 哇
Oh, wow!

646
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,080
哦
Whoa!

647
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,690
这尼玛逼还挺有味
That got flavor!

648
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,600
- 搞毛？ - 你是第一个看见我肚脐的人
- What? - You're the first person who's seen it.

649
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,400
来一发爱斯基摩热吻？
Little Eskimo kisses?

650
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,890
哦 还从没人对我这么做过
Ooh, I never had anyone do that to it before.

651
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,240
- 哦 你的牙  - 对不起
- Ooh! Watch the teeth! - Sorry.

652
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,330
中招辣
Got him.

653
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,410
好吧
Okay.

654
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,440
对不起 我没什么时间洗澡
Sorry. I didn't have time to shower.

655
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,600
我操
Shit!

656
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,480
谢谢
Thank you.

657
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,490
哦
Ooh!

658
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,960
好 准备好了吗
Okay. You ready?

659
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,800
老子要带你一飞冲天辣
I'm gonna take youto a whole 'nother galaxy!

660
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,530
啊我操老子要射了
Oh, my God, I'm coming!

661
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,520
啊老天
Oh, God!

662
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,840
天啊天啊天啊天啊
God! God! God! God!

663
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,320
- 哦  - 结束了？
- Whoo! - Already?

664
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,130
啊真爽呀
Oh, that was amazing.

665
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,240
讲真？我居然还期待些
Really? I guess I was expecting something

666
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,080
不同的东西
different.

667
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,560
没关系 这是你第一次 没事的
Don't worry about it. It's your first time. Don't sweat it.

668
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,130
经验丰富了就好了 继续努力
You'll get better with experience. Just keep working on it.

669
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,040
你知道自古以来
Oh, you know, it's customary for a woman

670
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,810
女人都要在事后给男人做一个超大三明治
to make a man an oversized sandwich

671
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,160
来帮助男人恢复精神的对吧
to help him regain his strength.

672
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,880
要么吃剩的披萨也行 或者煎饼果子
Either that or some leftover pizza,or maybe a Hot Pocket.

673
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
你想要我现在给你做煎饼果子？
You want me to make you a Hot Pocket now?

674
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,200
这又不是我规定的 我只是在告诉你而已
I don't make the rules, I'm just telling you.

675
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,800
前路漫漫啊孩子
You got a lot to learn, kid.

676
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,760
恩…
Mmm...

677
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,090
你他妈就睡着了？
Are you asleep already?

678
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,360
死黑鬼
Nigga!

679
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,560
呃
Ugh!

680
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,560
克里斯蒂安？
Christian?

681
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,050
- 克里斯蒂安  - 我操
- Christian! - Oh, shit!

682
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,240
那他妈是谁
Who the fuck is that?

683
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,280
我老妈
My mother.

684
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,600
哦
Oh!

685
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,680
真棒
Great.

686
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,880
操 现在我得对付两个疯婊子了
Now I gotta get rid of two crazy bitches. Fuck.

687
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,880
老妈
Mother!

688
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,080
- 啊 克里斯蒂安  - 你好啊
- Ah, Christian. - Hello.

689
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,080
你最好快点换身衣服 我们赛艇会要迟到了
Oh, you better get dressed, or we're gonna be late for the regatta.

690
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,960
我都忘了 就是今天啊
I forgot that was today.

691
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,570
你不会又在吸毒吧？
You're not doing crack again, are you?

692
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,320
- 没有啊老妈  - 我从来都没让你嗑着药长大
- No, Mother.  - I never raised you that way.

693
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,320
可吸毒却是你们家的通病
However, it is a prominent trait in your genealogical pool.

694
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,520
嗨
Hello.

695
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,760
这是我的领土 这是我的领土
I'm standing my ground! I'm standing my ground!

696
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,250
哦我操
Oh, shit!

697
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,160
老妈 你在干嘛啊？那是汉娜・斯蒂尔
Mother, what're you doing? That's Hannah Steale!

698
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,250
我得给你说多少次啊？黑人的命也很重要的
How many times I gotta tell you? Black lives matter.

699
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,810
来 我扶你起来
Come on, let's get you up.

700
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,520
- 汉娜 这是我老妈 克莱尔  - 哦
- Hannah, this is my mother, Claire. - Oh.

701
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,400
不好意思 汉娜
I am so sorry, Hannah.

702
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,480
欧老天 你咪咪真好看
Oh, my, you have beautiful breasts.

703
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,480
我隔着衣服看还以为都下垂了
I would've thought they'd be more droopy,

704
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,440
就像是塞了石头的袜子一样下垂
like a sock with a rock in the toe,

705
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,800
就像寰宇地理杂志里演的那种
like in those National Geographic magazines.

706
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,080
你得理解一下我老妈
You're gonna have to forgive my mother's behavior.

707
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,210
她有时候说疯话 而且还种族歧视
Sometimes she can be factually inaccurate and quite racist.

708
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,160
别为我道歉 克里斯蒂安
Do not apologize for me, Christian.

709
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,730
我是你妈妈 我爱你
I am your mother, and I love you

710
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,520
我把你当做我亲生的白人崽
like you were my own white child.

711
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,640
但是我晚上还是要把钱包藏起来 以防万一
But I still hide my wallet at night, just in case.

712
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,210
你应该这样
As you should, Mother.

713
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,320
很高兴见到你
It is awesome to meet you.

714
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,760
- 你们俩在约会吗？ - 没 我们没在约会
- Are you two dating? - Oh, no, Mother, we're not dating.

715
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,520
我们只是啪啪啪而已
We're just fucking. Hard.

716
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,920
快而狠的啪啪啪 最爽啦
And quick. Apparently, it's the best way.

717
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,560
那好吧 我见到你真的非常高兴 汉娜
Well, I just can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you, Hannah.

718
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,240
我是说 你是我见过克里斯蒂安的第一个女朋友
I mean, you're the first woman I've seen Christian with.

719
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,810
我之前还以为…
I assumed that he was...

720
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,200
欧普拉怎么说的来着？“好好的男生说弯就弯”
What would Oprah say? "On the DL?"

721
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,320
克里斯蒂安 你眼光怎么这么低
Christian, you can do so much better.

722
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,440
哦 老妈
Oh, Mother.

723
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,170
你是世界上最富 最帅的男人之一
You're one of the richest, most handsome men in the world.

724
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,480
你可以去勾搭白妞啊
You could date white women.

725
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,080
[两人分别是高尔夫球星和歌手]
像泰戈尔・伍兹或席尔
Like Tiger Woods and Seal.

726
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,960
好了 我觉得你该走了老妈
Okay, it's time for you to go, Mother.

727
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,170
[分别是演员、音乐制作人、说唱歌手]
或者塔耶・狄格斯 昆西・琼斯？冰老T也行啊
Or like Taye Diggs or Quincy Jones. Or even Ice-T.

728
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,450
汉娜 克里斯蒂安的中国姐姐 梅 来这里啦
Hannah, Christian's Chinese sister, Mai, has come to town,

729
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,320
所以我们准备举办一个家庭晚宴
so we're gonna hide the cats and have the family over for dinner.

730
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,440
- 你也该来啊  - 我跟荣幸
- You should come. - I'd be delighted.

731
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,800
见到你真心很高兴
It was really nice to meet you.

732
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,680
好了真棒 老妈 该走啦
Okay, great. Time to go, Mom.

733
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,240
哦…
Oh...

734
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,560
那我的钱包哪儿去了
Now, where is my wallet?

735
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,360
还在这呐
Still there.

736
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,160
- 你小子永远都猜不到在哪  - 是啊
- You just never know. - Yeah.

737
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,760
恩…
Mmm...

738
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,680
真尼玛好吃
They're delicious. Mmm.

739
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,240
好啦
All right.

740
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,800
早饭吃完了 走吧
We had breakfast. Time to go.

741
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,360
瞧 你的Uber到了咧
Ooh, look, your Uber's here. All right.

742
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,200
好吧 又怎么了？
Okay, what?

743
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,560
说
Spit it out.

744
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,080
恩 你是怎么就喜欢上了
Well, how did you get into this whole

745
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,360
玩儿SM呢
dominant-submissive thing?

746
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,680
我老妈之前有个好朋友
It was one of my mother's really close friends,

747
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,440
还有我的音乐老师
and my music teacher.

748
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,800
我那时十六岁
I was 16.

749
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,560
她比我稍大一点
She was older.

750
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,000
别这么紧张 克里斯蒂安
Don't look so nervous, Christian.

751
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:28,840
我现在需要你做到最好
All I ask is that you do your very best.

752
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,930
我以为我们是要上音乐课啊
I thought I was supposed to be here for music lessons.

753
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,570
没错啊宝贝儿
Baby, you are.

754
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,080
第一节课从这里开始
And your lesson starts right here.

755
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,640
喂 喂 停
Hey, hey. Ooh. Snap.

756
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,720
[著名黑人AV男星]
你丫简直就像约翰・福尔摩斯啊
We got a regular John Holmes here,

757
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,480
除了没有大丁丁而且秒射

00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,200
知道我为什么打你吗 布莱克小子？
Do you know why I hit you in the head with that tambourine, Black?

761
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,480
不知道
I have no idea.

762
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,210
你刚刚节奏是快了还是慢了
Well, were you rushing or were you dragging?

763
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,800
我…我们不是在嘿咻吗
I... I thought I was fucking.

764
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,120
那不算嘿咻
Oh! That wasn't fucking!

765
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,600
现在你来数拍子
Now, count off.

一 二…
One, two...

767
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,160
我是快了还是慢了？
Was I rushing or was I dragging?

768
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,560
- 回到我  - 你快了
- Answer the question! - You were rushing!

769
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,200
哭了？哦 可怜的小崽子
Is that a tear? Oh! Poor little guy.

770
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,560
- 你生气吗？ - 生气
- Are you upset? - I'm upset.

771
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,200
你这个毫无价值的 被领养的 没人爱的小傻逼
You worthless, adopted, unloved little piece of shit!

772
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,400
在我逼里又哭又闹 像个九岁小姑娘一样
Weeping and slobbering over my vagina like a 9-year-old girl!

773
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,760
现在 你他妈最后再说一次
Now, for the last father-fucking time,

774

哦 布莱克小子 滚下床去 你让老娘恶心
Oh, Black, get off the bed! You make me sick.

776

- 可我好生气啊  - 滚下床去
- But I'm upset. - Get off the bed!

777
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,160
- 你压根就没准备好  - 我准备好了
- You're not ready for this! - I'm ready!

778

你最好给老娘打起精神 布莱克小子
You better get your shit together, Black!

782
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,330
你啥都驾驭不了 女人不行音乐也不行
You're not gonna amount to anything, sexually or musically.

783
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,890
而且你知不知道
And you know what the biggest

784
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,800
让我最失望的是什么吗？
disappointment of all is to me?

785

我以为你们黑人节奏感强鸡鸡也大
I thought all you black men had rhythm and a big dick!

786
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,200
老天 我真是想错了
Boy, was I mistaken!

787
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,120

Wait a minute, is that a Retina display MacBook Pro?

796
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,280
婊咂 你们屁眼交易过了吧

这是克里斯蒂安想让我签的什么嘿咻协议
It's just a weird sex contract Christian wants me to sign.

805
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,120
你签了 就问他要钱 明白不？
You sign that, but then you get that paper, boo, all right?

806
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,200
这是你应得的 继续去舔他屁眼吧
A bitch gotta get hers. You keep licking that bootie, okay?

807
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,400

You got me all fucked up with your emojis, like...

812
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,520
呃 你怎么钻进去的
Hey, how did you get in here?

813
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,040
这重要吗？
Does it matter?

814
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,040
重要 因为你一不住在这 二没有钥匙
Yes, actually it does matter, because you don't live here and you don't have a key.

815
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:08,480
你进这篮子又不需要钥匙啊 汉娜
You don't need a key to get in a hamper, Hannah.

816
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,440
好了 现在帮忙把我弄出来
Here, now, help me outta here.

817
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,090
我没藏在你的药柜里算你好运
You're lucky I wasn't in your medicine cabinet,

818
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,850
或者你的首饰盒
or your jewelry box.

819
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,080
我试着藏在你床头柜里来着
I tried to hide in your nightstand,

820
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,160
但是里面放了一本基甸圣经 所以我藏不下了
but you had this Gideon Bible in there and I couldn't fit.

821
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,000
等等 你是破窗进来的吗？
Wait a minute, did you break in through that window?

822
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,040
这扇窗子吗？
This one?

823
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,840
不不不 这可能是任何人干的
Oh, no, that could've been anybody.

824
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,600
地上那块砖头写着“克里斯蒂安的财产”
The brick on the ground says "Property of Christian Black."

825
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,200
“克里斯蒂安…”
"Christian..."

826
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,640
哦 哦 是诶
Yeah, yeah, it does.

827
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,960
但是 那砖头可能属于其他叫克里斯蒂安的黑人的啊 对吧？
But, I mean, that could belong to any black Christian, right?

828
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,280
我是说 闭嘴…
I mean, okay, shh...

829
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,130
不要再问问题了
Enough with the interrogation.

830
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,720

别动
Do not move,

832
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,890
不然我就要惩罚你了
or I'll be forced to punish you.

833
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,050
我说了别动
I said don't move!

834
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,120

你准备好了吗 斯蒂尔小姐？
Are you ready, Ms. Steale?

841
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,760

848
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,680
我就想知道你是不是对我负责
Just knowing you care enough to use protection excites me.

849
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,400
啊哈 俺很值得信赖的
Aha! Old trusty dusty!

00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,440
你们都在浪费时间
You are wasting time.

944
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,290
你 你就是个瘾君子
You. You're a drug addict waiting to happen.

945
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,560
瞧瞧你 你现在迫不及待想出去抽根大麻
Look at you. You can't wait to get outta here and smoke some weed.

946
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,290
你 你是脱衣舞者
And you! You are a stripper!

947
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,240
不管我在说话还是坐着 你屁股都在扭
Your ass is twerkin' as I'm sitting here talking.

948
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,080
你能从任何事物里找到节奏
You can find the rhythm in anything.

949
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,400
还有你 先生
And you, sir.

950
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,640
哦 你是白人 哦那你就没事的
Well, you're white. You'll be fine.

951
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,680
所以 我其实想说
So, in closing, I would like to say,

952
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,680
“感谢上天我不是你们”
"Thank God I'm not you."

953
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,960
- 卡提莎 我的天 我们做到了  - 妹子

我太为你骄傲了
I'm so proud of you.

955
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,280
我该找谁说呢？就差一点了妹子
Who you telling? I was close, girl.

956
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,920
我再多给别人撸一管 就能当上优等生了呢
I was one handjob away from losing valedictorian to that bitch,

957
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,570
林赛・黄 是吧？
Lindsey Hung, right?

958
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,400
- 你在说什…  - 闭嘴
- What are you talking... - Shut up.

959
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,640
我看那碧池啊 满嘴胡话
I see that bitch, she talkin' shit.

960
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,560
待老娘教训了她
She gonna need a gynecologist

961
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,920
她就得去看妇科医生了
when I'm done fucking that bitch up! All right!

962
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,560
妹子 待会儿见了
Girl, I'll see you later.

963
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,210
老娘要去喂那碧池吃拳头
I'mma go punch a bitch in the throat.

964
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,400
林赛 你个双语系的碧池

Oh! I'm so proud of you.

970
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,480
告诉你 我以为你会越长越难丑
You know, I thought you'd turn out not to be shit.

971
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,240
结果相比起以前那个喝醉的鸡样
But you ended up looking real good,

972
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,080
你现在还算能看
being that you from a drunken whore.

973
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,280
- 哦是啊  - 恩 你妈妈又去康复中心了
- Oh, yeah. - Yeah, your mama's over at the rehab.

974
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,440
二十七次了 真他妈着了魔
Twenty-seven times is the fucking charm.

975
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,480
- 是吗？ - 是啊我操
- Isn't it? - Yeah, it's the fucking charm.

976
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,920
嘿 我其他几位继父呢？
Hey, where are my other stepdads?

977
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,600
就在那里
Right over there.

978
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,840
老强尼 逼逼金
Jonny Quest, B. B. King.

979
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,600
至于那没穿衣服的老黑是谁我也不认识
I don't know who that nigga is with his shirt off.

980
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,360
大概是你亲生爹吧
That must be your birth daddy.

981
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,530
很不错 很不错的一群家伙
Yeah, it's all good. What a great bunch of guys.

982
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,400
就像老话说的“能凑出一个村儿”
And you know the old saying, "It takes a village."

983
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,600
确实是这样 尤其因为你妈
And it's true. Especially when it comes

984
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,200
还是个阴沟站街女
to your mom being a gutter slut

985
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,400
这村儿还是个乱交村
and the village is a gangbang.

986
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,840
- 乱交村  - 汉娜
- The village is a gangbang. - Hannah!

987
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,840
你好啊
Hi!

喂喂喂慢着 花花公子
Hey, hey, hey, hold up, player!

989
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,440

Shit, how you gonna walk up and kiss the girl that I raised?

990
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,930
这他妈算什么事？
What kind of shit is this?

991
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,200
罗恩 这是我男朋友 克里斯蒂安・布莱克
Ron, this is my boyfriend, Christian Black.

992
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,920
男朋友
Boyfriend!

993
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,840
罗恩 我跟你说实话 我就操了她几次而已
Ron, to be honest with you, I just fucked her a few times.

994
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,120
“男朋友”这叫法 太严肃辣
"Boyfriend" makes it sound serious, like I went raw.

995
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,640
我是说 我可能…
I mean, I might've dipped, but...

996
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,130
你想娶了她？
Are you thinkin' about marrying her?

997
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,320
没
No.

998
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,560
那如果她怀孕了呢？
What if she get pregnant?

999
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,000
还是不娶 死都不娶
Still no, but hell no.

1000
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,320
我喜欢这小伙
I like this fella!

1001
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,970
我喜欢你这小黑鬼

You know what, from player to player, Black, I really like you, man.

1004
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,200
- 你想操谁就去操谁  - 谢谢你
- You can fuck anybody you wanna fuck. - Thank you.

1005
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,680
恩 但是别把她操完就扔 像我们对她妈妈那样
Yeah, just don't pass her around like we did her mama.

1006
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,760
- 我就这点要求  - 没问题先生
- That's all I ask you to do. - Yes, sir, out of respect.

1007
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,760
我们把她妈扔了 扔的可随便了呢
We passed her mama around like a baton, man.

1008
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,880
是啊
Yeah.

1009
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,370
你从来都没和我说过你妈啊
You never told me that about your mother.

1010
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,680
你妈当时操遍了整个邻居街坊
Your mother fucked everybody in the neighborhood,

1011
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,160
然后她突然想结婚成家了 来找我 我也就答应了
and then wanted to settle down with me, and I went for it.

1012
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,730
告诉你 我得多和你出去玩 老哥
You know what, I gotta hang out with you, man,

1013
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,760
偷点儿你的知识来 因为你真的很渊博
get your knowledge, man, 'cause you got a lot of wisdom.

1014
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,160
哥渊博是因为哥经历得多
I got a lot of wisdom and I been through a lot,

1015
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,800
哥骑过无数女人
and I done been with a lot of hos

1016
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,920
哥手指上遗留下来的味道

一点儿不错 小兄弟
Yes, man.

1021
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,730
感觉美丽与恐怖集于一体
It was like beautiful and horrible at the same time.

1022
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,880
我这手爆过这世界上
I've stuck my hands in some of

1024
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,480
讲真？
Really?

1025
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,400
- 亚洲的 马来西亚 刚果  - 恩

1028
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,960
我在迪拜机场爆了她菊花
Touched a bitch's booty hole in Dubai at the airport.

1029
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,200
我觉得你能传授给我不少东西 老黑
I bet you could probably spit a lot of game to me, my nigga.

Ready? One, two, three. Nigga!

1033
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,730

Where are we going?

1034
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,080
恭喜毕业 汉娜
Congratulations, Hannah.

1035
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,810
是辆车啊
That's a car.

1036
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,610
车窗坏了的车？
With a broken window?

1037
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,920
喜欢不？
Do you like it?

1038
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:49,400
恩 挺好
Yeah. It's nice.

1039
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,200
你知道我为了偷这辆车花了多大功夫么？
You know what I went through to steal this car?

1040
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:55,080
我是说…这车是偷来的
I mean...The car was a steal.

1041
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,880
- 你跟我翻白眼？ - 没
- Did you just roll your eyes at me? - No.

1042
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,680
听好 这世上我只讨厌两件事
Listen, there's only two things I hate,

1043
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,200
翻白眼和越梅干
when you roll your eyes at me and Craisins.

1044
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,810
越梅干是什么？不算越梅 也不算果干
Like, what is a Craisin? It's not a cranberry, it's not a raisin.

1045
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,530
这根本就说不通嘛
Like, it doesn't even make sense.

1046
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,240
- 你丫有跟我翻白眼  - 我没有啊
- You just rolled your eyes at me again! - No, I didn't.

1047
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,280
当然有 我都录下来了
Yes, you did. I have it on tape.

1048
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,770
来看看
Check this out. Look at this.

1049
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,850
瞧她在干嘛 翻白眼啊 快看
Oh, what's she doing? She's rolling her eye. Look at that.

1050
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,960
- 你怎么做到的？ - 你 跟我走
- How did you do that? - Come on, you, with me, now.

1051
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,080
但是…
But...

1052
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,400
我来告诉你翻白眼的下场
Teach you a little lesson about rolling your eyes. Come on.

1053
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:33,840
哦
Oh.

1054
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,320
现在 你知道我为什么要惩罚你吗？
Now, do you know why I'm gonna punish you?

1055
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,040
因为你是个喜欢虐待女人的变态
Because you're a sicko who likes abusing women.

1056
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,560
你说的还有点道理 但是这并不是原因
While there may be some truth to that, that's not the reason.

1057
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,000
因为我翻白眼了
Because I rolled my eyes.

1058
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,160
对咯
Bingo.

1059
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:50,720
哦
Oh!

1060
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:57,880
等会儿你的屁股会比我的手要疼很多
This is gonna hurt you a whole lot more than it's gonna hurt me.

1061
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,080
嘿
Ha!

1062
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,480
欢迎来到我的世界
Welcome to my world.

1063
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,160
哦 我操
Oh, God! Fuck!

1064
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,880
好疼好疼
Ooh, that hurt! Oh!

1065
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,440
你打了吗？
Did you do it?

1066
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,920
嗷
Ow.

1067
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,850
好 第十五行 该填“冬日饮品”
Okay, 15 across, "winter beverage."

1068
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,080
妈的 你一点感觉都没？
Nothing? You don't feel nothing?

1069
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,240
我真心喜欢织东西
I love knitting.

1070
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,600
你到底要不要打我？我都开始无聊了
Are you gonna spank me? All this build-up is getting boring.

1071
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,360
好吧好吧 跟老子玩？
Okay, okay, you wanna play?

1072
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,040
老子有备而来
Oh, I got something for you.

1073
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,240
让一下
Excuse me.

1074

Christian, I've fallen head over heels in love with you.

1468
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:18,760
呃…哇
Uh...Whoa!

1469
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:22,640
慢着 这可不在协议里啊
Slow it up. That is not in the contract.

1470
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:25,880
我还特意说了
Like, it specifically says, and I quote,

1471
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:28,240
“臭婊子不要爱老黑”
"Bitch don't love a nigga."

1472
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,720
明白？我还双倍加粗了这几个字
Okay? And I double-bolded that.

1473
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,480
我就知道我应该逼你签字的
I knew I should have had you sign this contract.

1474
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,480
克里斯蒂安 我觉得你最好离开吧
Christian, I think it'd be best if you leave.

1475
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,560
滚
Get out!

1476
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:42,120
好 你想要我走？行 我走
Fine, you want me to leave? You want me to leave? Fine, I will leave!

1477
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,850
好吧？等等 暂停
Okay? Wait, time-out.

1478
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,080
呃…
Um...

1479
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,920
这是我家诶
I live here.

1480
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,320
该走的不是你么？对不？
Shouldn't you be the one leaving? Am I wrong?

1481
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,920
带把伞 因为…
Take an umbrella 'cause...

1482
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,520
下雨辣 婊咂
Bitch, it's raining.

1483
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:00,400
把我的车还我
I need my car back.

1484
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,130
我已经卖掉了
I already sold that piece of shit.

1485
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,400
卖了三十七块 我会写支票给你的
I'll send you a check for $37.

克里斯蒂安 你得放我走了

求你听我说
Please, listen to me!

1490

不 你听我说
No, you listen to me.

1491
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:16,840
你会找到这么个人的
You'll find someone. Somebody who wants to be open

1492
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,360
一个愿意接受你那些下流玩意儿的人
to all the demeaning things that you wanna do to them.

1493
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,600
汉娜
Hannah!

1494
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:21,680
克里斯蒂安
Christian.

1495
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,320
哦
Ooh.

1496
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,400
啊
Ah!

1497
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:25,840
天啊
God!

1498
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:37,480
他怎么会爱你？他连自己都不爱
How is he gonna love you? He doesn't even love himself.

1499
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:41,360
瞅瞅他那发型啊妹子
Did you see his haircut, girl?

1500
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:45,490
你怎么会觉得这感情能发展下去呢？
How could you think this was gonna end well?

1501
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,720
绝不反悔
Never look back.

1502
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:57,000
克里斯蒂安
Christian.

1503
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,440
汉娜
Hannah.

1504
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:02,240
在我跑了四十七层楼梯的时间里
While running down 47 flights of stairs,

1505
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:04,650
我想了很多事
I had plenty of time to think.

1506
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:09,560
然后当我在二十三楼晕倒的时候 我意识到我该给你道个歉
And when I passed out on the 23rd floor, I realized I owed you an apology.

1507
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,520
我就想说 我不该那么对你 对不起
I just want to say I'm sorry for the way I treated you.

1508
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,360
尤其是那水刑
Especially for the whole waterboarding thing.

1509
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,570
我觉得你对本・拉登的想法是对的
Turns out you were right about bin Laden.

1510
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,920
- 谁知道那些呢？ - 所有人都知道
- Who knew? - Everyone.

1511
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
恩？
Hmm?

1512
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:22,320
你伤害了我 克里斯蒂安
You hurt me, Christian.

1513
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,680
我知道 但是我还有软点的鞭子啊
I know. But I have softer whips.

1514
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:26,600
上面还带粉色毛毛的那种
You know the kind with the pink fur on it?

1515
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:28,440
那种打起来不疼
It takes the sting off.

1516
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,120
我不是在说这个
That's not what I'm talking about.

1517
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,960
- 你想要浪漫的爱情  - 那是我应得的
- You want romance. - I deserve it.

1518
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,120
好 那你告诉我
Well, what's more romantic

1519
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,160
还有比跑四十七层楼梯更浪漫的么？
than running down 47 flights of stairs?

1520
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:37,520
我跑断了一根腿筋啊你造吗？
You know I pulled a hamstring?

1521
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:39,000
你死了没？
Did you die?

1522
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,680
没死 但是我至少一周不能去我的XX房了
No, but that's gonna keep me out of the Red Room for at least a week.

1523
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,560
拜拜傻逼
Bye, bitch.

1524
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:46,040
好吧好吧好吧 汉娜 等等 汉娜
Okay, okay, okay. Hannah, wait, wait. Hannah!

1525
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:48,080
别 克里斯蒂安
No, Christian. You are incapable

1526
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,520
我无法和你拥有一段平凡的爱情
of having a normal relationship.

1527
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,400
我知道 但我正在努力尝试 好吗？
I know, but I'm trying, okay?

1528
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:54,290
我也想像那个老年痴呆的老头一样
I want to be like that old man whose wife has Alzheimer's,

1529
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:55,520
每天起来
and he wakes up every day

1530
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,250
都能和他老婆一起唠人生
and he tells her the story about their lives together.

1531
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:59,600
然后俩人一起睡一觉就再也不起来
And then they take a nap, but they don't wake up.

1532
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:01,400
因为他们死翘翘辣
Because they're dead.

1533
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:02,920
[二四年美国电影]
这又出自《恋恋笔记本》
That's The Notebook.

1534
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,560
就是那部莱恩・高斯利和那个大脑门姑娘的电影？
That's the one with Ryan Gosling and the girl with the big-ass forehead?

1535
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:06,640
哦
Oh.

1536
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,320
他从来没忘记她
He never forgot her.

1537
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:10,560
你又不喜欢斯派克斯的电影
You don't even like Nicholas Sparks movies.

1538
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,880
我以前不喜欢 但现在喜欢啊
I used to hate them, but now I love 'em.

1539
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:14,840

包括《绝唱》
Even The Last Song.

1540
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,370
那他妈为啥能拍成电影啊？
Why was that even a movie?

1541
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:18,720
你知道原著都不能算是本小说么？
You know that wasn't even a book?

1542
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:21,600
好吧 如果我再给你一次机会 我必须看到你的改变
Well, if I'm gonna give you another chance, things have to be different.

1543
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:23,010

我想说的是
What I'm trying to say is, I love

1549
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:45,000
我爱

那库基说的最疯狂的事。
That Cookie just says the craziest things.

1551
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:49,640
好吧
Okay.

我爱你
I love you.

1553

你要带我去做私人飞机辣？
Are we gonna go on your private jet?

1557
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,200
老天 啥样的飞机啊？
Oh, my God, what kind of jet is it?

1558
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,760
别别别告诉我 惊喜我一下
No, no, no. Don't tell me. I want to be surprised.

1559
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:21,720
啊
Ah!

1560
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:25,160
我不敢相信你居然认为我会带你去坐私人飞机
I can't believe you thought I'd take you on a private jet.

1561
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,640
我是爱你 但是你连戒指都没有诶
I love you and all, but you don't even have a ring yet.
