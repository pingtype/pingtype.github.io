游说是深谋远虑的博弈
Lobbying is about foresight.

About anticipating your opponent's moves

并作出相应对策
and devising countermeasures.

The winner plots one step ahead of the opposition,

and plays her trump card

在法庭上
You better not be saying that

10

最好不要说这样的话
when you're in there.

11
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,860
要攻其不备 出其不意
It's about making sure you surprise them,

12
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,410
而不是被对方乱了方寸
and they don't surprise you.

13
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,870
我再问一遍
I'm gonna ask you again.

Miss Sloane, could you please

描述一下你的工作性质？
describe the nature of your work?

16

鉴于法律顾问的建议
On the advice of counsel,

恕我无法回答你的问题
I respectfully decline to answer your question,

18
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,720
根据美国宪法第五修正案
based on my rights under the Fifth Amendment

19
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,140
我有权保持沉默
to the United States Constitution.

20
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,560
这几句话
Those words,

21
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,560
当你在完成宣誓 确认细节时
when you're not taking the oath or confirming details,

22
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,690
每句话都会成为呈堂证供
those words, in that order, are all you're gonna say.

23

“通常来说 你是否承认自己
"On average, would you say you bribed public officials

"more or less than once a month?"

鉴于法律顾问的建议… 我打断一下
Upon the advice of counsel... Can I deviate slightly?

26
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,410
“鉴于法律顾问”？还是可以说…
"On the advice of counsel"? On the advice

27
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,790
- “鉴于我的辩护律师”？ - 不可以…
- "of my attorney"?  - You do not...

28

好吧我懂了 这么称呼
Okay, okay, I understand that last one's

29
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,170
对你来说风险太大
too adventurous for you.

30
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,080
把第五修正案常常挂在嘴边
This would be a whole lot easier

31
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,630
岂不是更容易吗
if I could just shout "Fifth."

32
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,340
他们想送你进大牢
They want you behind bars.

33
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,680
只要你发出一句声明
You make one statement,

34
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,310
要为自己澄清罪行
you correct one nefarious allegation,

35
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,850
那你就废废了
that's it.

36
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,220
丢掉了第五法案赋予你的权利
You waive your right to the Fifth

37

还不得不面对各种各样的问题
and you're compelled to answer everything.

38

他们会在全国媒体面前
They're taking you to the woodshed

39
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,610
把你拉下水
in front of the national press.

40
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,810
会不断激怒你
They're gonna rile you so bad

41

Palm oil is a key ingredient in Nutella.

这法案就被我们搞定了
His bill dies a quiet death.

137

这就是违法的
it's illegal.

If they use a non-profit LLP to sponsor the travel,

00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,170
因为这样旅行就变成一次教育考察了
As long as the trip is for educational purposes.

142
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,670
但实际上还是印尼政府买的单
But, the Indonesian government is still paying for it.

143
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,130
你看 这就是我打算读研究生的原因
See, this is why I'm thinking about post-grad.

144
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,810
简 人们读书 是要为进入现实世界做准备
Jane, we go to school to prepare us for the real world.

145
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,350
我可能并不喜欢现实世界
I'm not sure I like the real world.

146
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,020
你就喜欢把自己埋在苏格拉底的书堆里吗？
So you want to bury your head in Socrates?

147
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,860
其实 那些都不是苏格拉底写的
You know that Socrates never actually wrote anything.

148
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,900
我们跑题了
That's beside the point.

149
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,490
不喜欢的话 就做出改变
If you don't like it, you change it.

150
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,600
- 这就是你工作的意义  - 斯隆女士！
- That's why you're here.  - Miss Sloane!

151
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,440
他们已经在会议室等您了
They're ready for you in the conference room.

152
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,450
斯潘塞 你知道相比肥皂
Hey, Spencer, did you know that Americans care more

153
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,580
能多益更关心能多益吗？
about Nutella than they do about soap?

154
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,370
好吧
Uh, okay.

155
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,030
看见没？
See that?

156
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,740
毫无反应
No reaction.

157
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,740
各位 我们速战速决
Okay, guys, we gotta be quick this morning,

158
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,130
我还有个会
I've got a meeting to get to.

159
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,120
国际货币基金组织集会大约有多少人？
How many are they expecting at the IMF rally?

160
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,420
五百到一千人
Between 500 and 1,000.

161
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,340
大约百分之百的比例？
There's a margin of 100%?

162
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,380
也就是说 没有人愿意出面？
Does that technically mean that nobody might show up?

163
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,840
至少会出席五百人 其他的就看天气咯
Five hundred's the minimum, the rest depends on weather.

164
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,840
看样子晴天人们不太愿意出门呢
Seems more people hate banks when the sun's out.

165
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,560
- 天气预报怎么说？ - 利兹？
- What's the weather forecast?  - Liz?

166
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,730
雅各布斯去印尼的那几天
Time we sold Jacobs on Indonesia.

167
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,810
我知道
I know.

168
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,430
- 等亨利倒台了 我们就有…  - 群聚效应 我懂
- When Henry falls we've got...  - Critical mass, I'm aware.

169
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,770
找个非营利组织赞助这次旅行
Get a non-profit to sponsor a vacation.

170
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,850
他会给脸不要脸的
They give him face and he'll pull it.

171
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,030
你是刚从女洗手间出来吗？
Did you just come from the ladies' room?

172
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,990
我不懂你的意思
Uh, I have no idea what you're talking about.

173
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,940
我们说的是国际货币基金组织集会的出席人数
We're talking about numbers at the IMF rally.

174
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,030
亚历克斯 通知麦德龙·泰兰
All right, Alex, put Metro Talent on notice,

175
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,080
- 我们请求支援  - 这就去
- we may need reinforcements.  - I'm on it.

176
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,320
真的要动用群众演员吗？
We're really gonna use movie extras?

177
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,750
那个叫嚣着指责企业贪婪的家伙
The guy shouting about corporate greed

178
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,410
站在演员选派部无业游民的身边
becomes a lot less credible standing next

179
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,040
举个“废除货币”标语
to a hobo from central casting,

180
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,500
少了不少说服力
with a banner that reads, "Abolish money."

181
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,750
“什么话
"Shit is fucked up

182
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,170
“真是一派胡言”
"and bullshit."

183
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,960
这标语真是赞爆了 不会是我们的人吧
Best banner at Occupy. Tell me that was one of ours.

184
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,710
不是 这要比我能想到的方式妙多了
Oh, no, that was creative way beyond my capabilities.

185
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,800
- 富兰克林！磨茹白蛋糕呢？ - 在！
- Franklin! Shmallow Cakes?  - Uh, yeah!

186
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,380
蛋糕和饼干都要收营业税
Does sales tax apply to cakes and cookies,

187
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,650
还是只是其中一种要收？
or only to one of those?

188
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,480
我不清楚
I don't know.

189
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,940
你不清楚？
You don't know?

190
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,560
你们听好了
All right, everybody, listen up!

191
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,770
我要讲故事了
I'm going to tell you a story.

192
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,820
可别
Please, no.

193
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,190
有一天 牧师从教堂
A priest is giving a young nun

194
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,620
开车把一位年轻修女送回家
a lift home from church one day,

195
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,320
他趁换档的功夫
and as he's shifting gears,

196
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,950
把手搭在修女的膝盖上
he rests his hand on the nun's knee.

197
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,710
这样太无礼了 是不对的
This is offensive and inappropriate.

198
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,290
年轻修女抬头看看牧师 说
The young nun looks up at the priest and says,

199
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,080
“神父 你还记得路加福音十四章十节吗”
"Father, remember Luke 14:10."

200
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,830
牧师收回了自己的手 感到尴尬
The priest withdraws his hand, embarrassed.

201
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,790
后来路遇红灯 车子又停下来
Next time they stop at a light,

202
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,540
他把手放在修女大腿上方一点点的位置
he places his hand a little higher up on her thigh,

203
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,100
修女又说“还记得路加福音十四章十节吗 神父”
again the nun says, "Remember Luke 14:10, Father."

204
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,060
牧师道了歉
The priest apologizes.

205
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,430
“我心有余而力不足” 他说
"The flesh is weak," he says.

206
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,230
把修女送回家后 牧师回到家里
So he drops her off, and when he gets home,

207
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,890
拿出圣经 翻到路加福音十四章十节
he reaches for his bible and he flips to Luke 14:10.

208
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,560
你们听懂了吗？
Anyone know what it says? Hmm?

209
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,530
什么意思 帕特？
What does it say, Pat?

210
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,270
“朋友 请上座 这样才能获得荣耀！”
"Friend, come up higher, then shalt thou have glory!"

211
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,400
了解自己分内的事！
Know your subject, people!

212
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,820
不然的话
Failure to do so may result

213
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,450
可能会丧失绝佳的机会
in the loss of a golden opportunity.

214
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,240
今天下午上班的时候
When I see you this afternoon,

215
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,410
最好熟练到
you'd better be ready to recite

216
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,580
可以用世界语背下免税代码
that tax code in Esperanto.

217
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,670
他们说我应该和她握手
I'm... I'm told I should offer her my hand, huh?

218
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,260
什么意思
How do you mean?

219
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,960
我是说第一次见面的时候
Well, when we meet, I'm told that

220
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,050
他们说她并不喜欢
she doesn't care for all that kissy-kissy stuff

221
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,430
一般人见面的吻面礼
that most women do these days.

222
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,900
你们之前没见过吗？
You two have never met?

223
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,440
倒是见过几面
Well, we've been to several of the same functions, yeah,

224
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,030
可从没互相认识过
but we've never been introduced.

225
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,600
这里又不大 这怎么可能呢？
In a town this small, how does that happen?

226
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,690
我该握手吗？
So, should I offer my hand?

227
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,120
不必太担心这个
I wouldn't worry about it.

228
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,780
- 利兹？ - 早
- Liz?  - Good morning!

229
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,200
比尔·桑福德
Bill Sandford.

230
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,740
居然这么久我们才认识
I'm amazed it's taken this long.

231
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,080
本来我是想
Well, you know, I wanted to introduce myself

232
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,370
在自由企业晚宴上就自我介绍的
at the Free Enterprise Dinner,

233
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,090
但你很快就离场了
but you were the first one out the door.

234
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,960
我去处理了下国会那边的小状况
Minor crisis on the Hill.

235
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,710
换做一般的领导
Well, a lesser commander

236
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,340
就会直接交给下属去办了
would've left that to a soldier,

237
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,170
这也是我拜访的原因
which is the reason I'm here.

238
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,220
诸位有何贵干？
Why exactly are you here?

239
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,140
像希顿·哈里斯一样推翻法案
Killing bills like Heaton-Harris,

240
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,760
对你们来说是常事
that's food and drink to you guys.

241
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,100
- 这么说你读过了？ - 没有 但我清楚法案的内容
- So you've read it?  - No, but I know what it is.

242
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,730
这是一部基于普遍背景调查的
It's a bipartisan gun bill

243
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,350
两党枪支法案
requiring universal background checks.

244
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,780
不只是针对枪支 一切轻武器都算
On all sales of firearms.

245
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,190
就好比说
Now, come on.

246
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,490
父子关系是一生连带的
A father and his son, lifelong friends.

247
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,330
都是早晚的事
It just means longer delays.

248
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,280
分析了一种独裁式的犯罪行为
It's some kind of Big Brother type criminal

249
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,200
建立了心理健康的数据库
and mental health database.

250
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,040
对于宪法第二修正案有些相悖
An unconstitutional fetter on the Second Amendment

251
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,000
正如你所说
which, as you said,

252
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,750
这是我们的常态
we will eat for breakfast.

253
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,340
桑福德先生 一般来说 我处理的都是些课税
Mr. Sandford, I deal primarily in taxation

254
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,960
和联邦政府
and Federal Government interference

255
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,090
对自由企业的干涉事件 这件事…
in free enterprise. This...

256
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,680
我清楚 我清楚
I'm aware, I am aware.

257
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,340
听我一句
But I'll tell you,

258
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,430
你为自己树立的形象
the reputation you have garnered for yourself,

259
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,890
吸引了我们想要与你共事
we were just looking for an excuse to engage you.

260
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,310
好吧 我们谈谈吧
Okay. Let's have it.

261
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,520
女性
Women.

262
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,020
投票数据表明
Our polling data is telling us

263
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,150
我们不只是为了和女性选民取得联系
that we're not connecting with the female voter.

264
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,240
也想做出些改变
So, we want to change the narrative.

265
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,490
母亲不再会因为枪支失去自己的孩子
From mothers losing their kids to guns,

266
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,200
而是可以举起枪支保护他们
to mothers protecting their kids with guns.

267
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,800
受虐的妻子也不会再收到子弹的威胁
From a battered wife threatened by a bullet,

268
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,470
而是可以依靠枪支保护自己
to fending off her violent husband with a .38.

269
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,630
枪支成为赋予女性权力的工具
Guns as tools of female empowerment.

270
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,640
那句话怎么说来着？上帝创造人类
What's the saying? God created humans...

271
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,510
发明改变人生
Samuel Colt made them equal.

272
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,900
利兹 假设有这样一个组织
Now, Liz, imagine a new organization,

273
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,440
专门是为那些
pitched at women who are deterred

274
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,230
因第二修正案止步不前的女人建立的
by the strong rhetoric of the Second Amendment groups,

275
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,200
由我们的参与保证了她们的政治权利
and by our association with the political right.

276
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,750
但不涉及我们自己
But no links to us, no baggage.

277
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,830
不支持蓄意储存枪支
No overt position on guns.

278
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,500
而你
And you

279
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,510
就是这个议程的负责人
will build it up, you will drive its agenda,

280
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,380
慢慢地 你必然
and slowly but surely,

281
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,130
会将这些受益人
you will turn those members

282
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,890
转变为第二修正案的维护者
into paid-up guardians of the Second Amendment.

283
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,950
所以呢？
So, what? Um...

284
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,500
为了安全而持枪的母亲…
Mothers For A Safer America...

285
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,580
一定要这样
Achieved by making sure

286
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,920
让每个美国人都武装到牙齿吗？
every last citizen is armed to the teeth?

287
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,210
利兹？
Liz?

288
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,300
老天 难道这就是我树立的形象吗？
Jesus, is this the reputation I've garnered?

289
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,300
一个徘徊在道德边缘的人？
Gold medalist in ethical limbo?

290
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,800
我们只是在讨论问题 上升不到道德层面吧
I see no ethical problem with reframing an issue.

291
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,720
只是为了迎合女性选民而支持枪支买卖
Trying to win the female vote by taking the gun lobby

292
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,930
还美其名曰保护女性安全
and dressing it up in a frilly pink frock,

293
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,060
太不成熟了
it is so crude,

294
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,350
这肯定是你们一帮糙老爷们想出来的怪点子
it could only have originated in a room full of old men.

295
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,390
并不是
Well, it didn't!

296
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,440
这是我自己的主义
This is my own idea.

297
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,690
我建议你趁早断了念想
Well, my advice is to kill it in Heaton.

298
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,700
事情可没有你想象的那么简单
You'll need more than the trite wisdom

299
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,070
我们拿安全说事
that we value security

300
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,580
是为了回到第二修正案的议题上
to get us behind your views on the Second Amendment.

301
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,880
但事实就是
Well, the fact remains

302
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,510
目前女性选民
that when it comes to the female voter,

303
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,630
给我们的回馈并不乐观
our numbers need to be better.

304
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,390
我知道了
I see.

305
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,300
这样吧 拿数据说话
Well, why don't I take a look at the numbers

306
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,980
我们就事论事
and then we'll proceed from there?

307
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,150
她认为自己是谁啊？
Who the hell does she think she is?

308
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,310
计划可能就此夭折
It can be spun.

309
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,690
为获得选民信任
For the purpose of gaining trust,

310
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,100
这可能是最合适的策略了
it Heaton been the right tactical move.

311
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,520
你信不信 那一瞬间
And do you believe, for one nanosecond,

312
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,570
她脑子里想的
that was at the forefront of her mind

313
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,160
就是要他卷铺盖
when she told him to take his business

314
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,000
滚出我们这里
and shove it up his gun barrel?

315
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,070
坎迪斯！
Candice!

316
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,910
叫斯隆马上来我办公室！
I want Sloane in my office now!

317
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,000
办事效率真是高吧
She's good, isn't she?

318
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,540
你想拿数据说话？
You'll look at the numbers?

319
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,500
我敢说
I'm sure the president

320
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,460
国会任何一个组织的头头
of one of the most powerful groups on the Hill

321
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,210
都会因女王陛下
will be honored that Her Majesty

322
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,760
提出要拿数据说话而感到荣幸吧！
has agreed to look at the fucking numbers!

323
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,930
你出了什么问题？
What's going on with you?

324
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,800
目前的系统很不健全
The current system is so porous, it floats.

325
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,720
我可不记得你以前
I don't remember you caring, ever,

326
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,640
关心过枪支问题
one way or another about guns!

327
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,390
在科隆比纳和查尔斯顿事件后
My position solidified somewhere

328
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,310
我就坚定了自己的立场
between Columbine and Charleston.

329
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,400
乔治 任何大人物
Come on, George, any head-case,

330
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,860
重犯 甚至是恐怖分子 都可以
felon or terrorist can buy an assault rifle

331
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,360
从枪展 网络
from a gun show, the Internet,

332
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,900
或者从保龄球馆认识的朋友那里买到冲锋枪
or his buddy at the Bowl-O-Rama

333
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,450
连身份证都不需要提供
without so much as an ID.

334
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,820
多亏了希顿·哈里斯 枪支才受到管制
Heaton-Harris puts a stop to that.

335
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,780
老天啊 利兹 这可是反枪支管制啊
Christ, Liz, this is the gun lobby.

336
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,950
你知不知道
Do you have any idea

337
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,660
我把他们劝进来花了多少心血？
how long I've been trying to reel them in?

338
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,540
我知道了
No.

339
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,710
肯定有事
Something happened.

340
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,710
一定是你认识的什么人是枪支暴力的受害者
Someone you know was the victim of a gun crime.

341
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,130
不是 这就是我的观念
Nonsense. I just formed an opinion.

342
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,670
你是自由市场的冠军
You're the champion of the free market.

343
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,050
你痛恨那些不痛不痒的政府干预
You abhor frivolous government intervention...

344
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,300
我甚至觉得
I would hardly categorize

345
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,760
枪支法丝毫不无道理
responsible gun laws as frivolous...

346
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:49,890
印尼人！
Indonesians!

347
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,850
老天 你居然代表印尼人的立场！
For Christ's sake, you rep Indonesians!

348
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,730
我们不能让政府浑水摸鱼
To stop our government from looting

349
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,230
取走他们的经济来源
one of their few sources of income.

350
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,650
印尼怎么了？
And what is wrong with Indonesia?

351
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,810
我们不还要护送阿尔·雅各布斯
We're about to secure Al Jacobs

352
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,110
在那边考察么
with a field trip there.

353
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,700
你这算是承诺还是威胁？
Is that a promise or a threat?

354
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,530
我脑中甚至浮现出一位优秀的参议员
I can just picture the good Senator

355
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,030
被土著人丢到大锅里
being boiled in a cauldron

356
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,360
围跳土著舞的画面
with all these natives dancing around him.

357
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:11,450
你还是管好自己的五百个委托人吧
Get back to your Fortune 500 clients.

358
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,920
你这样来一出是一出
Your colorful interventions are the cause of

359
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,740
会给我们招来大麻烦的
a lot of industry backchat this firm could do without.

360
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,700
我依照信念做事
I work on behalf of causes I believe in.

361
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,130
这样才不会寝食难安
That's how I sleep at night.

362
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,920
做我们这行的 睡觉也不能放松警惕
You don't sleep at night.

363
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,380
时刻考虑的都是稳赢
You sit and obsess about winning,

364
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,220
无论代价如何
no matter the cause.

365
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,680
你包里的小药片
Those little pills in your purse

366
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,470
不是哄你入睡的工具
are not the kind that lull you to sleep.

367
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,930
你和你幼稚无用的团队还能留下来
The only reason you

368
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:38,230
只是因为
and your team of gum-chewing ragamuffins are here

369
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,030
你傲慢的外壳或许会吸引来
is that your arrogant pranks might generate enough buzz

370
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,270
像比尔·桑福德这样的委托人
to attract clients like Bill Sandford.

371
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:48,780
也就是说 如果你不努力完成他的诉求
Meaning, if you don't dedicate yourself to his cause,

372
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,320
我们留你也无用了
this firm won't have any use for you.

373
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,490
去研究那些数字吧
Now go away, look into those numbers,

374
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,250
让女性开始对枪支感兴趣
and start getting women into guns.

375
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,250
- 有头晕恶心的现象吗？ - 没
- Any dizziness? Nausea?  - No.

376
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,960
你总是这么说
That's what you always say.

377
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,520
医生我没事的
Doctor, I'm fine.

378
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,090
如果我的保险公司不费心
If my insurance company weren't such sticklers,

379
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,890
我也就付不起请你的钱了
we wouldn't even be having this conversation.

380
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,260
你几点睡觉？
What time are you getting to sleep?

381
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,600
我睡觉时间很随意的
I sleep a lot, it varies.

382
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,770
昨天几点睡的？
What time did you get to sleep last night?

383
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,240
你睡了吗？
Did you get any sleep at all?

384
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,480
现在正是非常时期
These are busy times.

385
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,860
不需要我来提醒你
You don't need a doctor to tell you

386
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,860
你这样下去是慢性自杀吧
that you're working yourself into an early grave.

387
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,530
那么长时间…
The long hours...

388
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,780
你打电话过来
Okay, when you called me just now,

389
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,040
拨的是什么号？
what number did you dial?

390
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,200
你家里的号码
Your home number.

391
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,830
挂掉电话 煮上可可
Cell is off, cocoa is on the stove,

392
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,080
准备好枕边读物
book is at my bedside.

393
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,670
不出两小时我就会睡着了
I'll be asleep in under two hours.

394
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,460
谢谢你打电话来 医生
Thanks for calling, Doctor.

395
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,800
在共和党
In the Republican party,

396
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,250
他可以帮你在加州…
he can help you out in California...

397
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,880
好吧！
Okay!

398
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,300
太好了 欢迎
Good, welcome.

399
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,050
是啊
Yes! Yeah.

400
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,970
我想带你见见参议员戴维森
I want you to meet Senator Davidson.

401
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,970
我很感激 每次资金筹集活动你都来参加
Yes. I appreciate you coming to every fundraiser.

402
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,850
我马上回来
Yeah, I'll be right back.

403
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,290
你好 期待下次见面
Hello! I expect to see you next time.

404
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,750
那太好了
Yes. That would be great.

405
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,340
见到你很高兴
Yes, nice to see you.

406
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,860
打算休息了？
Early night?

407
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,360
如果是冲说辞来的 别耽误时间了
If you're looking for a quote, you're wasting your time.

408
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,490
我刚注意到
I've just watched you extricate yourself

409
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,650
每间隔三十分钟 你就脱身去洗手间一次
from three conversations

410
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,730
总共去了三次
to use the ladies' room in the space of 30 minutes.

411
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,530
被你发现了 我控制不住 你说的没错
You busted me. I'm incontinent. Write it up.

412
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,030
真希望我的判断是错的
I hope I'm wrong,

413
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,660
但你这样会使人误认为你厌倦了这个地方
but one might think you're sick of this town.

414
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,000
你是邮局的人吗？怎么入场的？
You from the Post? How did you get in?

415
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,710
我就想占用你五分钟的时间
I'd just like five minutes of your time.

416
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,750
好吧
Fine.

417
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,080
我走到停车场只要三分钟 开门见山吧
Walk to my car is three, get to the point.

418
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,590
我听国会的人说 反枪支管制协会的人
The word on the Hill is that the gun lobby

419
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,970
接近你 想要反枪支管制
approached you over Heaton-Harris

420
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,210
被你回绝了
and you refused.

421
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,930
我对“国会的人说”不评价
I don't comment on "word on the Hill."

422
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,520
我了解你这样做唯一的原因
I know the only way you'd do that

423
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,310
就是你支持这项法案
is if you support the bill.

424
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,680
这么说来就有趣了
That's quite a story.

425
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,640
拒绝掉一位重要的委托人
Turning down a prized client because

426
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,360
因为你无法接受他们的立场
you can't accept what they stand for.

427
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,310
但对于信念坚定的说客伊丽莎白·斯隆 谁知道呢
Elizabeth Sloane, the conviction lobbyist. Who knew?

428
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,310
请直奔主题
I said, get to the point.

429
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,320
你是否承认 目前的系统是不健全的
Will you admit the present system is broken?

430
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,280
我坚定地支持第二修正案
I remain committed to the Second Amendment.

431
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,740
在德州 假阳具是违法的
Dildos are illegal in Texas,

432
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,790
但民众却可以走进体育商店
but Joe Public can walk into a sports store

433
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,160
随随便便就买到猎枪
and walk out with a shotgun.

434
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,790
说明在德州
That would explain the low rate

435
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,410
用假阳具杀人还不多见
of dildo-related murders in Texas.

436
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,870
并不好笑
Okay, it wasn't that funny.

437
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,000
你想干嘛？
What do you want?

438
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,300
来一句说辞
Your quote.

439
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,250
好吧 一个笃定的说客
Fine. A conviction lobbyist

440
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,930
只相信靠自己能力取胜即可
need only believe in their ability to win.

441
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,390
真是至理箴言
That's a keeper.

442
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,100
还有件事 我们私下里说
One more thing, off the record.

443
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,470
- 嗯  - 你知道
- Mmm-hmm.  - What do you know about

444
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,230
- 反枪支管制协会的对手是谁吗？ - 是布拉迪运动那些人吗？
- the gun lobby's opponents?  - The Brady Campaign?

445
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,230
我知道他们会输 因为他们全部预算加起来
I know they're going to lose because their total budget

446
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,530
还不如一个枪支说客
is less than what the gun lobby pays

447
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,610
花在擦鞋上的钱多
to get their shoes shined.

448
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,950
那他们的说客彼得森·怀亚特呢？
What about their lobbyists, Peterson Wyatt?

449
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,450
他们是一个精密的两党联立政府事务机构
They're a boutique bipartisan Government Affairs agency.

450
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,940
“精密”就是委婉表达规模小
"Boutique" is a euphemism for "little fish."

451
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,280
“两党联立”就是一群嬉皮士在耍宝
"Bipartisan" denotes a bunch of hippies in suits.

452
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,280
你知道他们的首席执行官是谁吗？
Do you know anything about their CEO?

453
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,530
一个叫施密特的人
Guy named Schmidt?

454
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,960
没听说过
No, never heard of him.

455
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,540
但既然是公司老大
But if the firm is built in his image,

456
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,840
估计一定是个虚与委蛇
I'm sure he's a simpering wuss

457
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,460
外强中干的胆小鬼
with a Ph.D in style-over-substance.

458
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,580
好吧
Got it.

459
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,640
我还没有自我介绍呢
I never introduced myself, by the way.

460
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,800
我叫鲁道夫·施密特
My name's Rodolfo Schmidt,

461
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:40,970
彼得森·怀亚特的首席执行官
CEO of Peterson Wyatt.

462
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,140
怎么了？
What's the matter?

463
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,440
我还没有你想象中的那样虚与委蛇吗？
Am I not simpering hard enough?

464
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,220
你的公司成立十二年了
Your firm's 12 years old,

465
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,980
我还以为你会叫彼得森什么的…
I'd think your name would be Peterson or...

466
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,400
这…
What...

467
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,280
这是什么情况？
What is this about?

468
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,400
你是希顿·哈里斯的拥护者
You're pro-Heaton-Harris.

469
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,520
现在人尽皆知
It's an open secret

470
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,950
你和你的上司正对着干
you're at war with your firm's leadership.

471
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,330
布拉迪团队想要你
The Brady Campaign wants you

472
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,820
把争论引到法案通过上
to lead the fight to pass the bill.

473
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,830
你要为我们辩护
You'd run defense out of our office.

474
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,240
事成之后
When it's over,

475
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,160
白宫大人物随你挑
you can choose from any of the D.C. behemoths

476
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,660
都会排队要你的签名
lining up for your signature.

477
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:14,210
这就是彼得森·怀亚特公司邀请你加入的说辞
This is Peterson Wyatt's quote for your services.

478
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,680
不知道这算是称赞
I don't know if I should be flattered

479
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:22,840
还是侮辱 施密特先生
or insulted, Mr. Schmidt,

480
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,260
不过显然你搞错我的立场了
but you clearly have the wrong opinion of me.

481
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,270
我可不这么认为
I think my opinion of you is right on.

482
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,940
别告诉我你不想插一手
Don't tell me you don't want to take a swing at this.

483
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,140
再见 施密特先生
Goodbye, Mr. Schmidt.

484
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,520
你的车呢？
Where's your car?

485
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,740
应该在洗车行吧 我不自己开车
Should be at the valet by now. I don't drive.

486
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,800
[一个笃定的说客 是不能只相信靠能力取胜的]

487
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,560
喂 简
Hi, Jane?

488
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,230
我知道很晚了
Yeah, I know what time it is.

489
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,020
听着…
Listen...

490
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,490
如果苏格拉底什么都没写过
If, uh, Socrates never wrote anything,

491
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,240
那别人是怎么知道这个人的呢？
how is it anyone's ever heard of him?

492
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,950
我们需要开个会
Look, we need a meeting.

493
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,710
参议员雅各布斯安排住在什么地方？
Where are they putting Senator Jacobs?

494
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,740
龙目岛上的小旅馆吗？
The Lombok Lodge?

495
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,870
是的
Yes.

496
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,420
- 旅馆在沙滩上？ - 是的
- It's on the beach?  - Yes.

497
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,790
很好
Good.

498
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,710
这个上交给参议院道德委员会
This goes off to the Senate Ethics Committee.

499
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,870
一经批准
Once they authorize the travel,

500
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,010
我们就送他上飞机
Jacobs is on a plane.

501
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,000
- 这样可以吗？ - 没事的
- Is that okay?  - It's fine.

502
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,250
- 理论上讲真的可以吗？ - 不必担心
- Technically, I mean?  - Don't worry about it.

503
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,260
只是… 作为说客 我们是不可以
It's just... As lobbyists, we can't be involved

504
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,510
为国会成员安排海外旅行的
in arranging overseas travel for members of Congress.

505
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,180
我闲暇时间在道德法规上读到的
I read ethics regs when I want to look busy.

506
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,100
如果你好好读一下
If you weren't just pretending to be busy,

507
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,190
你就会发现这事情是有变通方法的
you'd know that the workaround

508
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,310
那就是找到一个非盈利组织
is to get this to the non-profit,

509
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,520
叫他们签好字 上报给道德委员会就好了
have them sign and file with the Ethics Committee.

510
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,360
我是不是管的有点多了？
Do I seem unduly concerned?

511
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,940
好的
Okay.

512
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,520
乔治给我说了桑福德的事
George told me what happened with Sandford.

513
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,990
- 嗯  - 你脑子坏了吗？
- Mmm.  - Are you retarded?

514
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,410
你早餐为什么要吃巧克力蛋糕？
Why are you eating a chocolate cake for breakfast?

515
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,200
- 你好意思吗？ - 这是松饼
- Have you no shame?  - It's a muffin.

516
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,530
你早餐没有吃过松饼吗？
You never had a muffin for breakfast?

517
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,880
原来是松饼啊
A muffin, let's see.

518
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,620
鸡蛋 牛奶 面粉 糖 可可粉 巧克力
Eggs, milk, flour, sugar, cocoa powder, chocolate.

519
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,670
听上去和蛋糕也没差 话说回来
That sounds exactly like a cake, but of course,

520
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,710
没什么正常人
no civilized person would ever eat

521
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,300
会把巧克力蛋糕当做早餐
a chocolate cake for breakfast.

522
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,880
你真是疯了
You've lost your mind.

523
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,550
富兰克林 你弄明白了吗？
Franklin, are you getting this?

524
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,920
我要问你了
'Cause I'm really talking to you.

525
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:24,960
嗯？
Huh?

526
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,430
磨茹白蛋糕并不是真正的蛋糕
Shmallow Cakes aren't really cakes.

527
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,140
而是巧克力涂层的
They're marshmallow paste sandwiched

528
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,810
棉花糖夹心饼干
between two cookies covered in chocolate.

529
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,220
既然蛋糕不在免税范围内
And while our tax code deems cakes

530
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,810
越发受到强烈征税
luxury items and hits them harder,

531
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,440
饼干的未来就变得明亮了
cookies are obviously necessities,

532
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,780
必然也会被免税
and therefore exempt.

533
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,400
- 你懂了吗？ - 懂什么？
- Are you getting this?  - What?

534
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,490
将磨茹白蛋糕重新定义为饼干
Have Shmallow Cakes re-designated as cookies,

535
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,910
这种文字游戏只是一种营销手段而已
argue cake in the name is merely marketing puff.

536
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,490
在庭上需要用证据说话
You'll need evidence in court,

537
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,080
利用专家的意见
but get a team of scientists to opine

538
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:52,620
说服别人这东西八成是饼干 并非什么蛋糕
that they are in fact 80% cookie and zero percent cake.

539
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,330
你就稳赢了
That's how you win.

540
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,130
这你都懂？
You knew that all along?

541
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,830
总有一天你也会懂的
You would have got there eventually.

542
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,080
你告诉我这些做什么呢？
Then why are you telling me this?

543
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,510
为了让你不跟我走
In case you're not coming with me.

544
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,100
这什么情况？
What's going on?

545
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,340
好了 各位
All right, everyone.

546
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,470
我请各位来 是要宣布
I called you here to announce that,

547
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,510
很快
effective immediately,

548
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,680
我要离开这里
I am leaving Cole Kravitz

549
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,360
去彼得森·怀亚特公司
and starting work as lead consultant

550
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,560
做布拉迪运动的首席顾问了
for the Brady Campaign at Peterson Wyatt.

551
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,400
我向在座的各位担保
I've secured positions for everyone in this room

552
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,520
去到那边 你们的薪酬不减
without change to your current compensation.

553
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,110
谁愿意跟我走？
So, who's with me on this?

554
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,860
我刚费了老大力气
I just spent the last hour wiping your shit

555
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,410
帮你收买下比尔·桑福德
off Bill Sandford's shoes,

556
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,200
和他保证 找到你
assuring him that you're the right lady

557
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,710
他就不用愁了！
to broaden his membership!

558
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,540
本来都离成功不远了！
We're inches from a green fucking light!

559
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,790
我猜你是带不走了
So, you're saying I should put you down as a maybe?

560
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,470
你毫无胜算的！
You can't possibly win this!

561
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,800
有人跟我走吗？
Who's with me?

562
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,100
我跟你走
I'm with you.

563
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,810
别激动 罗斯 我需要你
Whoa, whoa, Ross, hey, come on, I need you.

564
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,060
她更需要我
She needs me more.

565
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,570
亚历克斯？
Alex?

566
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,650
劳伦？
Lauren?

567
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,530
搞什么？你们当是在拍《甜心先生》吗？
The fuck is this? Jerry Maguire?

568
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,030
你看了《甜心先生》？
You've seen Jerry Maguire?

569
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,740
我不喜欢枪支
Guns frighten me.

570
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,250
还有谁要跟我走？
So, Sloane and Co. Versus Connors and who else?

571
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,670
奥海拉 维克曼 摩尔 上帝使团
Mmm. O'Hara, Wickman, Moore, the God Squad.

572
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,130
拉米雷斯
Ramirez,

573
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,920
你手里有几支枪了？
how many Tec-9s do you own again?

574
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,170
足够我保护自己的财产安全了
Enough to defend my property.

575
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,430
还留了两支用来对付左翼分子
Plus two more to piss off the lefties.

576
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:32,800
好了 简
All right, Jane,

577
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,390
联系彼得森怀亚特公司的鲁道夫·施密特
contact Rodolfo Schmidt at Peterson Wyatt,

578
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,300
告诉他们我们总共有六个人要过去
and tell him there's a total of six coming over.

579
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,810
我数是五个啊
I count five.

580
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,270
你数学真不咋地
Mathematician you are not.

581
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,190
谁说我要跟你走了？
Who said I was coming?

582
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,440
我说的 快给鲁道夫打电话
I did. Call Rodolfo.

583
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,230
我要是想留下来呢？
What if I'm staying?

584
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,690
老天 现在可不是
Jesus, now is not the time to develop

585
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,500
开玩笑的时候 简
a sense of humor, Jane.

586
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,580
我并没有开玩笑
That's good, 'cause I'm not.

587
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,030
没事 你去吧
Seriously, kid, go.

588
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,710
不用管我
I could care less.

589
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,580
之前你说的对
You were right before.

590
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,550
读研究生就是一种逃避
About post-grad. Maybe it is a cop-out.

591
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,420
我所在的公司是这个城市最好的
I'm at one of the best firms in the city.

592
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,680
你的名望可能可以支撑你
Your reputation might survive a move

593
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:15,590
投入到一项毫无成功希望的战斗
to some third-tier outfit to fight a losing battle.

594
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,140
但我不同
Mine won't.

595
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,270
有道理
No shit.

596
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,310
我收回刚才的话
I take it back.

597
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,980
过去的几年 我从你那学到不少 利兹
I've learned a lot from you these last couple years, Liz.

598
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,150
我会想念你
I'll miss you.

599
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,820
但你凌晨三点打给我的电话
The 3:00 a.m. wake-up calls?

600
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,650
却没什么好怀念的
Not so much.

601
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,150
显然 你学到的不只有这些
You've obviously learned more than you let on.

602
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,660
刚刚过去的一分钟你展现的雄心壮志
You've shown more ambition in the last 60 seconds

603
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,990
比过去两年投入到工作中的还要多
than I've seen in the prior two years,

604
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,290
你却痴心妄想
but you are delusional

605
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,000
没有我 你自己可以立足脚跟吗
if you think you can survive without me.

606
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,510
等我们再次针锋相对
If we butt heads on this,

607
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,800
我就不会那么让着你了
don't think I'll show you any compassion.

608
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,720
基于这点
And with that in mind,

609
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,550
我打算再给你一个重新考虑的机会
I will give you a final opportunity to reconsider.

610
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,190
好了 我要去和大金融家们告别了
All right. I'm off to say my goodbye to the money-man.

611
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,780
到时候你若是
When this town guts you like a trout

612
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,950
被现实抽筋剥肚
and chokes you with your own entrails,

613
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,120
可别来找我哭鼻子哦
don't come sniveling to me.

614
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,370
过会我们会
We'll come back

615
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,580
回到亚洲印度尼西亚共和国一案
to the Asian Republic of Indonesia later,

616
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,550
我所担心的
but, you see, what troubles me

617
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:30,720
是你呼风唤雨的影响力
is the amount of influence you had.

618
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,890
我们已经收到
We've seen communications

619
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,720
华盛顿很多高级人物的来信
from senior figures in Washington

620
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:39,720
他们都担心 你身为说客
who feared that you, a lobbyist,

621
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,060
弹指一挥 就可以轻松毁掉他们的饭碗
could destroy their careers with a snap of your fingers.

622
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,820
你给自己树立的
Is this reputation something

623
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,270
就是这样一个形象吗 斯隆女士？
you've cultivated, Miss Sloane?

624
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,450
鉴于法律顾问的建议
Upon the advice of counsel,

625
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,610
恕我无法回答你的问题
I must respectfully decline to answer your question,

626
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,480
根据美国宪法第五修正案
based on my rights under the Fifth Amendment

627
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,320
我有权保持沉默
to the United States Constitution.

628
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,240
作为个人
You see, it's bad enough one person

629
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,160
拥有如此巨大的影响力不是什么好事
having that much influence,

630
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:05,410
如果这种人身上
but if they're out of control, if she has a problem,

631
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,830
存在癖嗜的问题
an addiction, well,

632
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:12,300
就好比美国政舰
it would be like the ship of American politics

633
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,100
是由醉鬼掌舵一样
is being steered by a drunk.

634
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,760
你是否有过
Do you, or have you ever had,

635
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,100
药物滥用的情况？
any problems with substance abuse?

636
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,100
鉴于法律顾问的建议
Upon the advice of counsel,

637
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,600
恕我无法回答你的问题
I must respectfully decline to answer your question,

638
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,480
根据美国宪法第五修正案
based on my rights under the Fifth Amendment

639
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:29,900
我有权保持沉默
to the United States Constitution.

640
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,110
我了解你睡眠困难？
I understand you have difficulty sleeping?

641
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,110
我们传审了你的病历记录
We subpoenaed medical records.

642
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:43,620
你长期患有慢性失眠
You're a long-time sufferer from chronic insomnia.

643
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,450
每天工作超过十六小时
You regularly work over 16 hours a day.

644
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,580
但无法入睡 是这样的吧？
But you can't get off to sleep. ls this accurate?

645
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,300
鉴于法律顾问的建议 我无法…
Upon the advice of counsel, I respectfully...

646
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,630
恕我无法回答你的问题
I must respectfully decline to answer your question,

647
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,630
根据
based on my rights under

648
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,390
美国宪法第五修正案
the Fifth Amendment of the United States...

649
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,640
我有权保持沉默
To the Constitution.

650
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,050
随便吧
Whatever.

651
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,680
医生为你开具了
You were prescribed

652
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:10,310
多重苯二氮平类药物处方
multiple courses of benzodiazepines,

653
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,060
但根据一位
but according to the deposition

654
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,400
目击证人的证词
of one of our witnesses,

655
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,570
你一直都在通过某种手段 在无处方的情况下
you've been procuring, off-prescription,

656
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,740
购买精神振奋类药物
a course of psycho-stimulants,

657
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,580
目的就是要延长清醒时间
with the aim of keeping you awake a little longer.

658
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,790
这是真的吗？
Is this true?

659
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,170
斯隆女士？
Miss Sloane?

660
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,550
鉴于法律顾问的建议
Upon the advice of counsel,

661
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,420
恕我无法回答你的问题
I must respectfully decline to answer your question,

662
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,960
根据美国宪法第五修正案
based on my rights under the Fifth Amendment

663
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,670
我有权保持沉默
to the United States Constitution.

664
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,680
好吧 我们回到
Okay. Getting back to this business

665
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,350
亚洲印度尼西亚共和国一案
of the Asian Republic of Indonesia...

666
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,930
我没有滥用药物
I am not a drug addict,

667
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,180
这一连串的质疑与…
and this line of questioning has no revel...

668
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,770
与此案无关
Relevance in this case.

669
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,520
我所服用的药物对我判断力的影响
My medication doesn't affect my judgment

670
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,270
同双份特浓咖啡无二差
any more than a double espresso.

671
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,520
说到药物神经麻痹
And speaking of intoxication,

672
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,110
我可以清楚地背出
I can recite from memory

673
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,610
一票醉酒后参与立法投票的
a list of upstanding, elected Senators

674
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,030
所谓正直的参议员的名单
who voted on legislation while severely inebriated.

675
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,530
现在
And just so you know, I think, by now,

676
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:04,990
我们都清楚了
we are fully aware,

677
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,280
还有 千万不要忘记
and in no danger of forgetting,

678
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,620
印度尼西亚是个共和国
that Indonesia is a republic,

679
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:13,550
只是碰巧位于亚洲大陆而已
which happens to be situated on the continent of Asia.

680
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,830
斯隆女士
Miss Sloane.

681
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,060
欢迎加入
Welcome to the party.

682
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,890
五年了
Five years.

683
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,850
真的值吗？
Was it really worth it?

684
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,400
- 少说五年  - 什么五年？
- Five years minimum.  - What's five years?

685
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:37,730
都拿印尼在亚洲来强词夺理
All for some puerile quip about Indonesia being in Asia.

686
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,490
你难道看不出 他们这样就是为了…
Can't you see that whole construct was designed to...

687
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,570
还真奏效了
And it worked.

688
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,080
你能不能告诉我什么五年？
Are you gonna tell me what five years is?

689
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,330
你上当了
You fell for it.

690
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,660
国会山上最机警的人
The smartest operative on the Hill

691
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,330
却让辛普森爷爷耍了
Just got played by Grampa Simpson!

692
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,540
我们就不能
Is it how long this conversation's

693
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,580
说点别的吗？
gonna feel like?

694
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:56,590
这是在国会前用现行汇率作伪证
It's the going rate for perjury before Congress.

695
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,920
现在你又否决了第五修正案
Now you've thrown out the Fifth,

696
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,330
想搞垮你的人
anyone who wants you in the ground,

697
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,840
不是个小数目
and that's a lot of people, they're hard at work

698
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,180
他们整天没日没夜
dedicating their creative and intellectual efforts

699
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,600
目的就是抓住你说谎的把柄
to catching you in a lie.

700
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,090
如果我一直保持沉默呢？
Well, what if I just stay silent?

701
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,100
真是个好主意
Well, that's a great idea.

702
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,850
你的律师怎么没想到这点呢
Shit, why didn't your lawyer think of that?

703
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,020
如果我拒绝回答…
If I refuse to answer...

704
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,190
他们会以轻视国会的罪名
They'll throw you in jail

705
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,690
- 把你关进大牢！ - 小点声
- for contempt of Congress!  - Shh!

706
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,360
你给他们留下了一个大机会！
You've just blown this thing wide open!

707
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,520
冷静点 丹尼尔
Calm down, Daniel.

708
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,450
你现在的样子像是很关心一样
You're starting to look like you care.

709
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:22,610
不
No.

710
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,730
我不想关心你
I don't care about you

711
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,070
我更想丢下你不管
any further than I can throw you.

712
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,200
我为国会山进行道德游说
I work for the one ethical lobbying practice on the Hill,

713
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,540
结果还要为模范人物
and I wind up defending the poster child

714
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,040
既信仰疗法后
for the most morally bankrupt

715
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,330
最大的道德破产进行辩护
profession since faith healing.

716
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,300
你的车在楼下
Your car's downstairs.

717
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,970
回家等着被钉上十字架吧
Go home, stare at the ceiling, get ready to be crucified.

718
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,210
我知道自己没有很好地
I know I don't have the most stellar record

719
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,310
接受你的建议…
in heeding your advice...

720
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,970
别再发假誓了！
Don't perjure yourself!

721
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,230
在伊丽莎白那没有成功 真是太糟了
Too bad things didn't pan out with Elizabeth.

722
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,610
[十一周前]

723
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,150
[十一周前]
我们还有其他选择
Oh, we have other options.

724
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,820
“阿米什鸡”是什么鬼东西？
What the hell is "Amish chicken"?

725
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,490
一种营销运动吗？
A marketing exercise?

726
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,410
我们正在找其他的说客
No, we'll just try and find ourselves another lobbyist.

727
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,250
我说的是阿米什鸡
I was talking about the Amish chicken.

728
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,820
哦
Oh.

729
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,580
她现在与你为敌
She's your enemy now.

730
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,590
我请你来 是因为
I invited you here because nobody

731
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,840
除了我们 没有人压制的了她
is better placed to neutralize her than us.

732
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,170
我们共事多年
We worked together for years.

733
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,510
非常清楚她的工作套路
We know exactly how she operates.

734
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,840
对了 阿米什鸡
Oh, that is just a regular bird

735
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,310
不过是阿米什地区饲养的一种鸟类
raised in Amish country, by the way.

736
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,340
啊
Ah.

737
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,100
因为信息封闭 所以吃起来更香是吗
It tastes better because it can't use Google, huh?

738
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,150
有超过五百万人同我们一样
Look, there's over five million of us.

739
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,310
拥有枪支
And we're armed.

740
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,110
我们曾否决过此类法案
We've beaten this kind of bill before,

741
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,660
这次也会成功
we'll beat it again.

742
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,950
民众会发起反抗
They'll make a lot of noise,

743
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,200
会表示不满 但最终
they'll wave their banners, but in the end

744
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,490
结果是可预知的
it's so predictable.

745
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,540
她是不可预知的
She's not predictable.

746
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,210
她的目的就是出其不意
She aims to surprise.

747
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,250
她会同自己的团队分享
She'll share things with her team,

748
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,550
但有所保留
but she won't share everything.

749
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,630
她会针对不同人制定计划
She'll have a plan for certain people,

750
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,460
但事后
but they won't know until they're dropped

751
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,670
他们才会意识到自己被利用
right into the middle of it.

752
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,880
她总是难以捉摸
There's always something else going on with her.

753
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,050
这就是她的工作方式
It's just how she works.

754
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,180
我们很清楚她会求助什么样的参议员
We have a good idea which Senators she'll go for

755
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,350
我们可以提前下手
and we can get in first.

756
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,730
对比其他人
And they're vulnerable on other members

757
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,900
他们要脆弱得多
they're already counting on.

758
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,030
密歇根的巴杰利
Badgley, Michigan.

759
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,860
手里掌握着六票之多
He can bring maybe six votes.

760
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,230
接近他 我们就很容易取胜了
We get to him, it's a quick win.

761
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:32,910
好吧
All right.

762
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,070
给我见识见识你们的间谍情报术吧
Show me some Badgley.

763
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,080
- 菲列牛排 一分熟  - 菲列牛排 要全熟
- Filet mignon, rare.  - Same, well done.

764
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,960
我也是
Well done too.

765
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,340
红点鲑
The Arctic char.

766
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,210
阿米什鸡肉沙拉 谢谢
Amish chicken salad, please.

767
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,210
失陪
Excuse me.

768
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,100
是你的洞察力帮你走到这一步
That kind of insight is exactly why you're here.

769
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,890
谁来过他这一关呢？
I'm sorry, who closed him again?

770
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,750
你谁啊？
Who the hell are you?

771
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,660
晚上好 女士
Evening, ma'am.

772
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,800
每次都来的那个马克呢？
What happened to the usual guy? Mark.

773
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,710
他是叫这个名字吧
If that's his real name.

774
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,720
马克不在这里了
Mark's moved on.

775
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,470
叫我福德就好
Call me Forde.

776
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,930
这是你的真实名字吗
Is that your real name?

777
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,510
是你的专属名字
Is to you.

778
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,810
- 你呢 可人？ - 天啊
- How about you, gorgeous?  - Oh, God.

779
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,140
你是政客 还是法人代表什么的？
You a politico, or one of these corporate-types?

780
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,520
你这样一位可人 怎么要到这里来呢？
What brings a fine lady like you to room 904?

781
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:47,440
不管你的事 你喝了多少？
Not the conversation. How much you had to drink?

782
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:51,070
毕竟这里随便喝 我喝得还不算多
Well, a free minibar, I'd say not nearly enough.

783
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,820
这里不能抽烟
You're not allowed to smoke in here.

784
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,860
这里也不能叫鸭
You're not allowed to buy company in here,

785
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,250
可你还是叫了
yet here you are.

786
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,660
抽烟是可以检测到的
Smoke is detectable.

787
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,830
会吸引别人的注意 你这样太不专业了
It could draw attention. It is unprofessional.

788
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,170
好吧
Okay.

789
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,000
真是一股政治气 你是律师吗
Corporate-type. Lawyer, maybe.

790
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,340
想继续的话
If we're going to proceed,

791
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,000
就得按照…
I require a certain standard of...

792
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,300
规矩办事
Agency rules, lady.

793
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,050
我只收现金
Payment in cash, I'm the only one

794
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,880
给钱我就不会告诉别人我们见过
to know this little party here ever happened.

795
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,100
也要为这些酒买单
And that's with half a minibar down my gullet.

796
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,680
你在找什么别的东西吧
I understand if you were looking for something else.

797
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,230
好吧
You'll do fine.

798
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,980
我们直奔主题吧
Let's get to the point.

799
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:33,620
好吧
All right.

800
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,830
但愿你们没有待在贫民窟里的感觉
Hey, I hope you guys don't feel like you're slumming.

801
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,540
我觉得还不如贫民窟呢
I thought it'd be weirder.

802
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,620
有坐垫有秋千
Bean bags, couple swings, maybe.

803
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,330
最起码也得有淋浴间吧
At least tell me you guys have shower rooms.

804
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,960
科尔·克拉维茨公司有淋浴间？
Cole Kravitz had shower rooms?

805
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,170
委托人同他待上三十分钟
Clients felt like they needed one

806
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,290
就会想去洗澡了
after 30 minutes with him.

807
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,630
我们设备齐全 只是没时间用
We had all the facilities, and no time to use them.

808
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,710
这样挺好的
This'll do fine.

809
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,600
楼下的自动贩卖机好怪
The vending machine downstairs is weird.

810
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,020
必须要知道性别和年龄范围
Wouldn't give me my beverage

811
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,640
才肯卖饮料出来
until I told it my gender and age range.

812
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,140
自动贩卖机公司
The vending machine company sells

813
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,440
把我们的个人资料卖给比格广告公司了
our personal details to Big Advertising.

814
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,310
我已经投诉他们了
I already posted a complaint.

815
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,560
没关系 我没提供真实信息
It's okay, I just lied.

816
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,230
你告诉它自己成年了？
You told it you were an adult male?

817
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,900
你为什么对他这么不友好？
Why are you so horrible to him?

818
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,730
雅各布斯刚搞定了能多益税
Jacobs just pulled the Nutella Tax.

819
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,450
- 什么时候的事？ - 我刚听说的
- When did that happen?  - I just got it.

820
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,530
棕榈油税？是你们搞定的？
The tax on palm oil? You're the ones who killed it?

821
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,660
像渡渡鸟一样都是过去的事了
Dead with the dodo.

822
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:17,990
印尼雨林里
Along with how many other unique species

823
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,200
其他的稀世物种也一样吗？
in the Indonesian rainforest?

824
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,580
你这个比方可真不咋地
Not your greatest analogy there.

825
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,460
这就看他们了
I guess it should be up to them,

826
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,160
毕竟国家是人家自己的
I mean, it is, after all, their country.

827
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,250
你知道他们那种原始的刀耕火种法
Do you know how much pollution their slashing and burning

828
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,410
给大气层带来多少污染吗？
pumps into the atmosphere?

829
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:30,340
占不到温室效应排放量的百分之零点二
Less than 0.2% of global greenhouse emissions.

830
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,590
- 这些谣言都是真的咯？ - 是的
- So, are the rumors true?  - Yes.

831
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,260
罗斯真是个娘娘腔
Ross is really a woman.

832
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,010
斯隆是艾斯·库伯的翻版吧？
Is Sloane the personification of an ice cube?

833
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,510
她平时都是站着尿尿
She pees standing up.

834
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,560
我都不那么尿尿
And, like... I don't even do that.

835
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,180
你讲话经大脑吗？
Do you think before you speak?

836
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,770
- 早上好  - 早
- Good morning.  - Good morning.

837
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,930
- 早  - 早
- Morning.  - Morning.

838
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,650
这样吧 我们按座位顺序
I was thinking, perhaps, we go around the table,

839
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,940
挨个介绍一下自己
introduce ourselves.

840
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,610
我们来点有趣的吧
Let's spare ourselves the tedium.

841
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,030
想要打破僵局吗 拿出你的洞察力来吧
If you want to break the ice, do it with insight.

842
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,700
我们坐在这里 都是为了推动
We're all here to ensure safe passage

843
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,950
希顿·哈里斯反枪支法案顺利收入联邦法律
of the Heaton-Harris Bill into Federal law.

844
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,780
我们该怎么做呢？
How do we do it?

845
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,910
事实上 我们做不到
Realistically, we don't.

846
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,450
我们能做的 只是尽自己所能
We fight as hard as we can,

847
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,120
建立强大的支持基础
build a strong base of support,

848
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,370
这样才能增大明年
so we have a better chance

849
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,040
讨论希顿·哈里斯法案时的胜算
when they introduce next year's Heaton-Harris,

850
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,130
或者后年
or the one after that.

851
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,460
我来这里
I didn't just move across town

852
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,210
可不是为了放慢失败的脚步的
with the aim of losing as slowly as possible.

853
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,550
你的名字和工龄？
Name and seniority?

854
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,300
埃斯米·曼尼克瑞安 工龄九年
Esme Manucharian, nine years.

855
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:19,220
曼尼克瑞安 我听说过你
Manucharian, I've heard that name.

856
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,640
埃斯米是我们请来的控枪专家
Esme's our authority on gun control.

857
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,390
只要有准确的资料
When it comes to facts and figures,

858
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,470
她无人能及
she has no equal.

859
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,980
是你领导了保护
You led the fight to preserve

860
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,640
伊利诺伊州隐藏禁令的斗争
the concealed carry ban in Illinois.

861
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,890
最后失败了 是我做的
Ultimately unsuccessfully, but, yes.

862
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,530
埃斯米 为什么会失败呢？
Okay, Esme. Why are we going to lose?

863
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,900
你知道布拉迪每在运动上投入一美元
For every dollar Brady spends on campaign contributions,

864
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,360
反枪支说客要投入多少吗？
you know how much the gun lobby spends?

865
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:38,570
- 三十八美元  - 三十八美元
- Thirty-eight.  - Thirty-eight.

866
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,740
政客毁于金钱 但这是为什么呢？
So, politicians bow to money. But, why?

867
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,910
钱又不揣进他们兜里 那样的话就是贿赂了
It's not going into their pocket, that'd be bribery.

868
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,080
就像印尼方对参议员雅各布斯所做的那样吗？
Like what the Indonesians just did to Senator Jacobs?

869
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,460
这是基于教育目的
That was legal bribery

870
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,000
的合法化的贿路 但也是贿赂
for educational purposes. But, yes.

871
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,620
参议员的优先权不在于代表群众
A senator's priority isn't representing the people,

872
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,130
而在于足不出户
it's keeping his ass in office.

873
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,420
真是嘲讽啊
That is so cynical.

874
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,170
“嘲讽”是乐观主义者
"Cynical" is a word used by Pollyannas

875
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,010
用来表达对童真的缺乏的
to denote an absence of the naivety

876
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,970
这表达真是强烈啊
they so keenly exhibit.

877
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,480
你融入得还真是快
Wow. You settle in fast.

878
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,100
如果参议员只在乎保全自己的职位
If senators only care about protecting their position,

879
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,850
不就成为了公众舆论的奴隶？
wouldn't that make them slaves to public opinion?

880
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,100
投票数据表明 多数美国人
Polling data puts a majority of Americans

881
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,400
都支持希顿·哈里斯反枪支
in favor of Heaton-Harris.

882
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,650
所以你们才会一输再输
And that's exactly why you keep losing.

883
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,820
实际上这是我们第一次接触枪支问题
Well, this is actually our first crack at guns,

884
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,860
但我接受你的观点
but I take your point.

885
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,200
什么观点？
What point?

886
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,940
我们太看重群众典论了
Public opinion is overrated.

887
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,950
参议员的中途改选率是百分之八十二
Midterm re-election rates for senators was 82%.

888
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,780
投票数是三十六
Voter turnout was 36.

889
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,960
我猜 其中大多数
And I'll bet most of them were

890
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,290
都是反枪支管制协会收买来的
paid-up members of the gun lobby.

891
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,460
多谢
Thank you.

892
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,290
我们的对手买通了
Our opposition has created a base of voters,

893
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,870
大量且狂热的选民
vast and fanatical,

894
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,220
这些人
who go out and vote exclusively

895
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,380
只对枪支问题进行投票
on the issue of guns.

896
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,580
我们该怎么对付这个状况？
How do we compete with that?

897
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,210
我们也培养自己的支持者
We build our own base of supporters,

898
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,420
只接受那些有意愿
who demonstrate a willingness

899
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:42,310
投枪支反对票的人
to get their asses into booths and vote against guns.

900
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:44,130
选民的意图受什么因素影响最大？
What's the best indicator of voter intention?

901
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,310
- 金钱！ - 财政！
- Money!  - Finance!

902
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,730
这就是我们的第一步
That's our first prong.

903
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,230
在群众阶层
Grassroots action

904
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,850
直截了当地发起捐赠
aimed squarely at soliciting donations.

905
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,860
不是空虚的名头 也不依赖网络的点击
Not names on a petition, not clicks in cyberspace.

906
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,180
他们会知道我们捐赠了多少钱吗？
Will they know how much we're raising?

907
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,230
非营利组织会对自己的财政情况作出报告
Non-profits have to report on their finances.

908
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:57,980
国会的每一位工作人员
And every Congressional staffer

909
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,280
都会盯着这些数据看
watches filing day like a hawk.

910
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:00,570
你们在外奔走之时
While you're out there hustling,

911
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,160
我去拜访那些有影响力
I'll be working influential senators

912
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,910
能够帮忙拉来同事的选票的参议员
who can deliver their colleagues' votes.

913
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,500
这是第二步
That's our second prong.

914
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,160
第三步 就是去搞清
Our third is to identify

915
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,250
是谁在支配我们的目标人群
who holds sway in target states.

916
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,340
那些雇员和工人阶级
Employers, workers' groups.

917
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,750
不能盲目闯入参议员办公室
Don't just waltz into a senator's office

918
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,080
就开始讲大道理
and make your case.

919
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,800
调查出他们信任的
Find out who they trust,

920
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:19,510
和不敢迁怒的对象
who they can't afford to piss off.

921
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,460
就说是这些人叫你来谈判的
Convince that person to make your case.

922
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:26,390
这样我们才能取胜
That is how we win.

923
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,270
不会开车？
Not a driver?

924
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,900
会 但是不开
I can, but I don't.

925
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,350
那你比我强 我都没拿到驾照
Well, you got further than me, I don't even have a license.

926
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,280
我的银行账户和自由主义者的良知
My bank account and liberal conscience

927
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:42,700
不允许我买车
won't justify my own car.

928
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,070
你是什么原因？
What's your excuse?

929
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,120
说实话 我车技可差了
To be honest, I suck at it.

930
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,200
十六岁的时候去考驾照
I took my test when I was 16.

931
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,870
结果这是我唯一一项没有通过的考试
Only exam I ever failed.

932
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:53,370
教练说我很鲁莽
My instructor told me I was reckless,

933
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,290
注意力也不集中
I lacked due care and attention.

934
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,880
从那以后我就知道自己有做政客的天赋了
Knew then and there I had a career in politics.

935
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,300
你条理很清晰
You weren't messing around in there.

936
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,770
是不是认识什么
Did you know someone?

937
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,600
枪支暴力的受害者
Someone who was a victim of gun violence.

938
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,140
不认识 为什么每个人都要问我一遍？
No, why does everyone assume that?

939
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,140
可能是因为你的观点很强硬吧
Strong opinions, maybe?

940
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,060
说得就好像只有亲身经历
As if I can only see the merits of an argument

941
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,980
才能看出是非曲直一样
when I feel the effects personally.

942
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:18,230
我曾认识一个国会议员 记不清名字了
There was a Congressman, I don't remember his name,

943
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,610
他的整个政治生涯都在反同性恋法
his whole career he was against gay rights,

944
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:23,650
直到他自己的哥哥出柜了才改变看法
only to do a complete U-turn when his brother came out.

945
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:26,370
多么有说服力的例子
What a well-reasoned basis for an opinion.

946
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,450
给他个小木槌 叫他去做法官
Give him a gavel, put him in a courthouse.

947
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,030
你饿了吗？
Are you hungry?

948
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,840
你每天晚上都来这里吃饭？
You eat here every night?

949
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,720
差不多 这地方基本不关门
Pretty much. Place never closes.

950
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,340
你怎么会不感到厌倦呢
How do you not get bored of it?

951
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:49,840
吃饭是必需行为啊
It's a necessity.

952
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,100
就好比我怎么能厌倦上厕所呢
It's like asking if I get bored of going to the toilet.

953
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,610
这么说来你可能觉得奇怪
Okay, this is going to sound alien to you,

954
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:58,770
但在我心里 食物占据了无与伦比的地位
but food takes up an inordinate amount of space in my head.

955
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,530
那枪支呢？
How about guns?

956
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,030
我尽职调查的时候 发现你的简历很突出
In doing my due diligence, your résumé stood out.

957
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,570
我注意到 你的很多工作都与轻武器相关
I noticed a lot of your work pertains to firearms.

958
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,450
我猜 是你有这样的思想偏好
I'm guessing that was a conscious decision

959
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,250
才会总做类似的工作吧
to steer things in that direction.

960
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,250
对这个问题 我的态度很强硬
It's an issue I feel strongly about.

961
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,790
这不关我的事
It's none of my business,

962
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,290
但我发现你的资料有缺口
but there was a gap in your profile.

963
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,630
九十年代后期 在去伯克利之前
Before Berkeley, you attended high school

964
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,380
你在印第安纳州布鲁明顿就读高中
in Bloomington, Indiana, in the late '90s.

965
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,880
但没有提到高中的名字
The name of the school isn't listed.

966
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,980
还有谁知道这件事？
Who else knows about this?

967
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,490
只有鲁道夫了
Rodolfo. That's all.

968
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,440
你应该猜得到我在想什么
You can imagine what I'm thinking.

969
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:50,860
打断一下 伊丽莎白 我的名誉是靠自己赚来的
I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but I earned my reputation.

970
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:53,330
与我在高中时发生的事
It didn't come from something

971
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,660
没有关系
that happened when I was in high school.

972
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,660
虽然我的观点受到了影响
Even if my views did.

973
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,370
公开发表意见甚至会减弱我的立场
Going public could even weaken my standing.

974
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,880
大家都评价我太情绪化
They'll say I'm too emotional.

975
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:03,750
不管怎样 真正用枪的人甚至都不会买枪
Anyway, the shooters didn't even buy their guns.

976
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,210
希顿·哈里斯
Heaton-Harris wouldn't have made

977
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,510
丝毫都不会在意
a shred of difference that day.

978
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,050
你担心立场薄弱…
You fear a weakened standing...

979
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,140
会毁掉你影响改变的能力
will damage your ability to effect change.

980
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,470
但如果一旦承认
But if acknowledging it was the difference

981
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,100
就会面临大输大赢的落差呢？
between winning and losing?

982
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,600
如果你放过我 把我和其他人同等对待
I'd appreciate it if you just treated me

983
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,940
我会很感激你的
as one of the team.

984
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,490
我能看出来你很有工作能力
A highly competent one, I can tell.

985
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,320
有你这样的员工是我们的幸运
We're lucky to have you.

986
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,990
六十是个神奇的数字
Sixty is the magic number.

987
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:38,040
只要六十票 就可以阻碍议案通过
Sixty votes breaks a filibuster.

988
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:39,740
反枪支管制协会四十一票通过？
So, the gun lobby wins with 41?

989
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,340
他们不需要这么多票也能通过
They could win with fewer.

990
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,130
我们需要达到六十票 少一票都不行
We need to hit 60. Anything less doesn't cut it.

991
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,590
五十九票都不行
Fifty-nine doesn't cut it.

992
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,220
我们需要找六十位参议员投票
We need 60 senators to show up and vote.

993
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,380
如果找不到 那就是看着他们胜利
We don't get that, they win, period.

994
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,510
正如我所说…
As I was saying...

995
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,510
我认为 反枪支管制协会
That by my reckoning, the gun lobby

996
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,270
能稳拿三十四票
has 34 votes pretty much locked.

997
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:00,850
就是这边这些人
And that's this side.

998
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,810
我们稳拿四十四票 就是这些人
I'd say we have 44 locked over here on this side.

999
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,860
还剩二十二人
That leaves 22 that are still in play.

1000
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,480
就是中间这些人
These fine ladies and gentlemen in the middle.

1001
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,070
希顿·哈里斯
Heaton-Harris, provisionally,

1002
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,150
是在八十四天内临时赶超的
makes it to the floor in 84 days.

1003
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,120
好消息是
The good news is,

1004
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:17,280
只要再搞定十六人 我们就达标了
if we can lock 16, we're over the line.

1005
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,830
这算是好消息？
I'm sorry, that's the good news?

1006
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,660
二十二人里面搞定十六人？
We need 16 out of 22 votes?

1007
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:22,950
这就好比考试及格线
That's like sitting an exam where the passing grade is...

1008
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:23,990
是七十二分一样
72% .

1009
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,670
那坏消息是 游说议员反对管制枪支买卖的人
And the bad news is that the gun lobby

1010
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,210
比我们想象中要有钱得多？
is rich beyond our wildest dreams?

1011
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,290
这是一点
There is that.

1012
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:30,130
还有要想从华盛顿
Or that it's not a whole lot of time

1013
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,250
最具势力的人手中得到十六票 我们的时间已所剩无几了？
to steal 16 votes from the most powerful group in D.C.?

1014
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:33,430
这也是
That, too.

1015
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,850
罗斯想说的重点是 我们需要十六票
What Ross is fumbling for is, we need 16.

1016
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:37,560
他们只需要七票
They only need seven.

1017
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,430
该死
Shit.

1018
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,690
…而整件事的始作俑者
and the man who did this

1019
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:48,190
却在我们的伤口上撒盐
robbed us of their smiles, of their laughter.

1020
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,360
我真的不能接受这种事情的发生
And I just can't accept that we allowed it to happen.

1021
00:43:55,750 --> 00:44:00,490
我们可爱的女儿 我们本可以避免这样的事情
Our beautiful girls, and we could have stopped it.

1022
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:01,830
我们本可以卸掉他的枪
We could have taken the gun

1023
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,170
这样我们的宝贝就…
out of his hand and my babies...

1024
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,790
天啊
Jesus Christ.

1025
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,870
就放到这里吧
We get the idea.

1026
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:09,080
布伦达和乔尔·帕特森
Brenda and Joel Patterson.

1027
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,710
枪击案在维斯康星
The shooting sparked a new wave

1028
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,420
掀起了新一轮的反枪支热潮
of anti-gun sentiment in Wisconsin.

1029
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:14,170
但那已经是一个月前的事了
And that was more than a month ago.

1030
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,220
但事件的热度并没有衰退
It's not dying down.

1031
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:17,140
布伦达已经成为“母亲需求运动”中
Brenda's become a prominent figure

1032
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:18,730
非常具有代表性的一员
in the Mothers Demand Action movement.

1033
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,730
每发生一起枪击案 公众的愤怒
Public outrage after a gun attack

1034
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,560
都会持续大约一个星期的时间
lasts maybe a week per casualty.

1035
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:26,180
公众现在对于帕廷森事件 应该已经不再关注了
This whole Pattinson story should be in the ground by now.

1036
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,310
- 是帕特森  - 什么？
- Patterson.  - Huh?

1037
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,440
他们的名字 是叫帕特森
Their name. The Patterson family.

1038
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:32,910
我他妈才不管他们叫什么名字
I don't give a shit if they're the fucking Partridge Family.

1039
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,200
那不是重点
This is her.

1040
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:36,530
得有人告诉桑德福
Sandford needs to know.

1041
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,950
我们的说辞必须具有很强的说服性
Our delivery must be tailored for maximum impact.

1042
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,030
过去的两周里 枪支管制的支持率已经提升了百分之八
Support for gun control is up 8% in the last two weeks.

1043
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:43,960
威斯康星的议员都很受挫
Both Wisconsin senators are vulnerable.

1044
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:45,750
如果他们不支持希顿·哈里斯
If they don't declare for Heaton-Harris,

1045
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,450
柯克帕特里克就撑不过今年秋天
Kirkpatrick won't make it through the fall,

1046
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:48,630
华莱士在两年内也会被推翻…
and Wallace is toast in two years...

1047
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:50,080
医疗方面的事是谁负责的？
Who's going to that medical thing?

1048
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,250
华莱士议员
Senator Wallace.

1049
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:54,960
他可以说服另两个温和派的人
He can deliver two other moderates.

1050
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,890
她是个天生的说客
And sure as she was born screaming,

1051
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,630
她一定会抓住机会 收买他们的
she'll see that as her chance to box them in.

1052
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:02,480
卡洛斯 这绝对不行
No, Carlos, that's unacceptable.

1053
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,560
媒体必须到场 这才是最重要的环节
The media has to be there, that's the whole point.

1054
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:08,150
必须要全方位的曝光 给他们施加压力
It has to be digitally stored and ready to be trotted out

1055
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,650
让他没有打退堂鼓的机会
should he even think about backing down.

1056
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,480
我马上发一张克拉拉·汤姆森的照片给你
I'm gonna send you a photo of Clara Thomson.

1057
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,980
她坐在左前方 穿着…
She'll be front-left, wearing a...

1058
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,110
克拉拉 你今天穿的什么？
Clara, what are you wearing?

1059
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,240
黑色单肩连衣裙
One-shoulder black crepe dress.

1060
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:18,120
一件黑色单肩连衣裙
A one-shoulder black crepe dress.

1061
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,160
如果我们运气好 办公室里只会有她一个人
If we're lucky, it'll be the only one in the room.

1062
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:21,370
谢谢你 卡洛斯
Thanks, Carlos.

1063
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,870
艾利克斯 快告诉我一个医生
Hey, Alex, tell me it's feasible that a doctor

1064
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,080
根本没时间参加 社交媒体之类的东西
wouldn't have time for all this social media bullshit.

1065
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:28,420
如果是十五个小时的活儿 那肯定的
Yeah, if you're pulling 15-hour shifts, I guess.

1066
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:29,630
太好了
Great.

1067

Could you not have just stopped when I said "great"?

1070
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:36,340
早上好
Good morning.

1071

还有时间看书？
Light reading?

你知道肺学是什么意思吗？
Do you even know what Doximity is?

1073
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:41,890
我知道
Yes, I do.

1074

研究肺的学问
It's the study of Doximity.

1075

肺是不对称的 右边有三个肺叶 而左边只有两个
Lungs are asymmetrical. Right has three lobes, left two.

00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:47,680
知道为什么吗？
You know why?

1077
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:48,970
因为你的心脏需要位置？

非常好
Bravo.

所有人 集合！
All right, everybody, listen up!

1080

对你而言 对不对称都不重要吧
Not a problem for you, I should imagine.

Let's have it, wake up!

1083
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:02,200
这是实现全国枪支实名制的第一步
It's the first step toward a national register of firearms.

不会有人该这么说的
No one's even come close to proposing that.

1086
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,460

反对枪支管制的人 他们的虚假言论都是围绕
The gun lobby's rhetoric is based on the falsehood

1090
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,750
我们要剥夺公众的权益来展开的 但这不是我们的本意
that we want to take something away from people. We don't.

1091
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:18,130
我们只是想让那些坏人
We want to make it more difficult

1092
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:21,060
获取枪支的途径更困难
for dangerous people to buy firearms.

1093
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,510
如果我们连这种言论都推翻不了
If we can't burst this fallacy,

1094
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,970

00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:28,180
- 好的  - 哈伍德·诺顿的执行总裁？
- Sure.  - Harwood Norton's CEO?

1097
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,010
没错 她是弗吉尼亚第二有权势的老板
Mmm-hmm. Second largest employer in Virginia.

1098
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:31,310
有两个议员都很摇摆不定
Both senators are teetering,

1099
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,110
但如果我能拜托她去说服他们…
but if I can get her to reach out to them...

1100
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,350
你不觉得让一个
You don't see the irony

1101
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:36,110
国防承包商的执行总裁支持禁枪
in asking the CEO of a defense contractor

1102
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,410
很荒唐吗？
to advocate for a ban on guns?

1103
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:38,860
我们不是要禁枪！
We're not banning anything!

1104
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:39,990
天啊 你说话的样子跟那帮人一模一样
Jesus, you sound like one of them.

1105
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,150
我只是很投入
I'm in character.

1106
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:42,330
下一个！
Next!

1107
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:43,620
新规定会让等待时间
Uh, the new rules will increase

1108
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,160
增加两星期
wait times by two weeks.

1109
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:46,490
欢迎来到美国
Welcome to America,

1110
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:48,370
你想照个X光 要等六个月
where you'll wait six months for an X-ray,

1111
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,080
但如果你想买支AR-15步枪
but, hey, you can buy an AR-15

1112
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:51,870
只需要十五分钟
in five minutes flat.

1113
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:54,130
在公众面前 你要说得这么随性？
You going to be that flippant in public?

1114
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,830
谨言慎行毫无记忆点 必须要一针见血
Pussyfooting isn't memorable. Sound bites are.

1115
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:58,090
措辞合理的版本是这样的
And the appropriate one goes like this,

1116
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:01,170
不能让极度渴望想要买枪的人
anyone that desperate to get their hands on a gun

1117
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:03,640
这么容易地得到它
shouldn't be allowed anywhere near one.

1118
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:06,350
威斯康星总共的核磁共振机器的数量…
The total number of MRI machines in Wisconsin...

1119
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,700
[威斯康星州 密尔沃基]
这个议员一旦结束演讲
If the good Senator ever finishes this speech,

1120
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,970
[威斯康星州 密尔沃基]
就会回答下面听众的问题
he will open it to the floor.

1121
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:11,350
你排在第三个
You'll be question number three.

1122
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:13,270
你觉得他会回答吗？
You think he'll go for it?

1123
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:14,690
他知道媒体都在现场
He knows the media is here,

1124
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,730
不会冒险在自己的资金凑集晚会上出丑的
won't risk being heckled at his own fundraiser.

1125
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:19,110
一直逼问他 让他别无选择
Back him into a corner, and he'll have no choice.

1126
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,030
…在我接下来的任期间
Of an additional $2 million

1127
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,780
会在一年内启用额外的两百万
for the purchase of four brand-new machines

1128
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:26,360
购买四台全新的机器
within the first year of my next term.

1129
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,200
谢谢
Thank you.

1130
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:31,330
非常感谢 谢谢大家
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1131
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:33,160
好了 再给大家几个机会
AH right, a few more questions

1132
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,750
向议员提问 之后本次活动就结束了
for the Senator, then we'll wrap up.

1133
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:36,370
好的 穿白衣服的女士
Uh, yes, the lady in white.

1134
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:39,680
议员先生 我是韦斯特菲尔中心的主席…
Mr. Senator, I'm Chair of the Westfield Center...

1135
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:42,720
第三个他应该叫我的 他在干什么？
He was supposed to go to me third, what's he doing?

1136
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,720
准守命令
Following orders.

1137
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,100
向后数三个桌子 向右两个
Three tables behind you, two to the right.

1138
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:49,520
他们从威斯康星一直跟踪我们
They've been tracking us through Wisconsin.

1139
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:51,440
可能名单上的人 他们都做了审查
They would have had everyone on that list vetted.

1140
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,890
你被发现了
You're blown.

1141
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,270
什么意思？
What do you mean?

1142
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:56,940
也就是说 该启用备用方案了
I mean that it's time for plan B.

1143
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:03,200
最后一个问题 拉杰·阿玛拉斯卡拉医生
And our final question goes to Dr. Raj Amarasekara.

1144
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:04,950
希望我没有读错
I hope I'm pronouncing that right.

1145
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,900
来自美国肺学协会
Of the Pulmonary Associates of America.

1146
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,240
谢谢
Thank you.

1147
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,160
拉杰·阿玛拉斯卡拉 实际上是一个名叫
Raj Amarasekara is a working actor

1148
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:12,590
马修·坎塔利亚的演员
named Matthew Kantaria.

1149
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:14,540
他们以为他会提关于
They think he's about to ask a benign question

1150
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:15,840
清洁空气倡议的问题
about the clean air initiative.

1151
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:19,130
…不难想象 我们会遇到三到四起枪击案
It's a safe bet we'll see three or four gunshot victims.

1152
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,380
有些受害者还是孩子 年轻人
Some are kids, teenagers.

1153
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:26,010
你为什么要在国会还没通过前 就想率先
How do you intend to vote on the Heaton-Harris Bill

1154
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,220
支持希顿·哈里斯法案？
when it's put before Congress?

1155
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:33,350
嗯…
Well...

1156
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,060
正如你所说
As you have experienced, uh,

1157
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:39,310
枪支暴力确实是真实存在的问题…
gun violence is a real problem...

1158
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:40,940
你把我当诱饵？
You decoyed me?

1159
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:43,270
拉杰·阿玛拉斯卡拉抄袭了
Raj Amarasekara has personally plagiarized

1160
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:46,530
七篇研究论文 都可以在网上找到
seven research papers, all available online.

1161
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:47,990
他还有医缘网的账号
He even has a Doximity account.

1162
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,540
…财政负担确实是有的
Financial burden is the fact that

1163
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:53,210
而有些受害者他们还是…
some of the victims are the, um...

1164
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:54,700
小孩
Kids.

1165
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:57,750
年轻人
The young.

1166
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,500
所以我觉得 首要的是
So, I think it's, uh, first and foremost,

1167
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:05,380
向那些受害者家属表示同情和慰问
to put our sympathies with the families of these victims.

1168
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:10,600
但是的确 枪支暴力对于我们的医疗系统
But it's true, gun violence puts an enormous strain

1169
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:14,140
以及其所需的人手 产生了很严重的负担
on our healthcare system and its work force.

1170
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,720
确实是这样的
Absolutely, yes.

1171
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:19,860
所以我才会全心全意支持
That's why I intend to give my whole-hearted support

1172
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,730
希顿·哈里斯法案
to the Heaton-Harris Bill.

1173
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,700
这叫掩人耳目
And that's a wrap.

1174
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:29,610
谢谢大家 非常感谢
Thank you. Absolutely, thank you.

1175
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,420
他还带了什么人？
Who else does he bring?

1176
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,510
法希特利和加西亚
Fascitelli and Garcia.

1177
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:46,210
埃斯米 星期三我给你准备了一个惊喜
Hey, Esme, I have a surprise for you on Wednesday.

1178
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,170
去新餐厅吃饭？
We're going to a new restaurant?

1179
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,720
参加纽约大学法学院 关于第二修正案的辩论如何？
How about a Second Amendment debate at NYU Law School?

1180
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,560
别兴奋过头了
Don't shout this from the rooftops,

1181
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,180
我相信你是整个团队
but I trust you to do a better job

1182
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:56,440
最有实力的人
than anyone else on the team.

1183
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:57,900
你不能去？
You can't make it?

1184
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:00,270
刚刚说的整个团队里 也包括我自己
I'm including myself as part of the team.

1185
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:01,860
我自己都还像个大学生
I wasn't cool enough to relate

1186
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:03,560
要怎么给其他大学生演示
to college kids when I was a college kid.

1187
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:05,570
稍后我会把细节发给你
I'll forward you the details.

1188
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,240
又是你
You again.

1189
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,660
我还专门打过电话 指名道姓叫他们派马克来
I called them and I specifically asked for Mark.

1190
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,080
那我也专门告诉你 他跑路了
And I specifically told you he skipped town.

1191
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,460
他去哪个代理公司了？
Well, what agency did he move to?

1192
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,300
我怎么知道
How should I know?

1193
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,170
我又不是他的保释官
I ain't his parole officer.

1194
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:25,540
他碰到麻烦了？
He's in trouble?

1195
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,670
我开玩笑的
I was kidding.

1196
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,390
啊 我们那晚玩得多开心啊
Aww, we had so much fun the other night.

1197
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,650
小姐 你知道门在哪儿
Well, you know where the door is, lady.

1198
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:38,850
去找你的马克吧
Go run to your Mark.

1199
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:21,560
我今晚有工作要忙
I've got work to do tonight.

1200
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,150
大案子？
Big case?

1201
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:28,190
福德 人机互动讲究的是互换原则
Forde, human interaction is an exchange.

1202
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:29,940
我的钱交换你的…
My money for your...

1203
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,150
老二？
Dick?

1204
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:33,030
我想说的是“专项技能”
I was gonna say "skill set."

1205
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:35,960
但这是我唯一愿意做的交换
But that's the only exchange I'm willing to make.

1206
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:38,120
你现在听起来像个银行家一样
Now you sound like a banker.

1207
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,740
我也得回去做准备了
I got to do prep anyways-

1208
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,870
做什么准备？
For what?

1209
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,670
明晚还有另一个客户
Another client, tomorrow night.

1210
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,920
你还要做准备？
You do prep?

1211
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,170
这是我的职责
For functions.

1212
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:51,130
信不信由你
Believe it or not,

1213
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,140
不是每个人雇我来 都是为了我的专项技能
not everyone hires me for my skill set.

1214
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:57,850
有一半的客户 都只是想让我躺在她们怀中
Half my clients just want me on their arm.

1215
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:59,310
有些人只是想找其他地方来的人
Some just want someone to talk to

1216
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,440
诉诉苦 吐露一下心声
from a different neck of the woods,

1217
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,810
- 反正也没人管得着  - 真是太可悲了
- who ain't gonna judge them.  - That is so pathetic.

1218
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,020
所以职责也是不同的
Functions are different.

1219
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,680
代理公司给了我一张身份清单
The agency gave me a list of covers.

1220
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:10,700
保险主管 销售
Insurance exec, marketing guy.

1221
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,270
明天扮演的角色是石油天然气工人
Tomorrow is oil and gas.

1222
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:14,070
下次见
I'll be seeing you.

1223
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:18,490
你还欠我点东西
I think you owe me something more.

1224
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:19,870
都在里面了 你自己数
No, it's all there. Count it.

1225
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:21,700
这钱是付我服务的
This covers my services.

1226
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,660
但刚刚我跟你 分享了一大堆
But I just gave you a whole lot of information

1227
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:25,700
关于我工作的细节
about my line of work.

1228
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,330
根据我们的互换原则…
On your principles of exchange...

1229
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:28,330
我的天啊！
Oh, my God!

1230
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:30,540
你刚刚是自愿跟我分享的
Okay, that was a voluntary donation on your part.

1231
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:34,550
我付钱请你 是想体验一下
I pay you so I can imagine a life I chose

1232
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,470
我为了追求事业 而选择放弃的那一种生活
to forego in the pursuit of my career.

1233
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,060
那你为什么不退出？
So, why don't you go out and get it?

1234
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,140
那不适合我
It's not for me.

1235
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:41,390
至少在我还二十几岁时
Not when I was in my early 20s,

1236
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,470
我不想过那样的生活
and sure as hell not now.

1237
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:44,360
也就是“没有家”
So, "no house you call home,

1238
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,520
“没有家人”
"no folks you call family,"

1239
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:46,900
- 那样的生活？ - 没错
- sort of thing, huh?  - Uh-uh.

1240
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:49,020
- 你有后悔过吗？ - 完全没有
- You ever regret that?  - Not for a second.

1241
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:52,230
至少现在我们对彼此有了些许了解了
At least now we're peeling a layer.

1242
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:55,280
我的互换原则就允许我透露这么多了
And that is all my principles of exchange will allow.

1243
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,570
再见 福德
Goodbye, Forde.

1244
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:17,600
如果你是个恐怖分子
If you're a terrorist,

1245
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,720
或者某个不应该出现在那架飞机上的人
or someone who shouldn't be allowed on that plane,

1246
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:21,350
你打算坐哪班航线？
which lane are you going to walk through?

1247
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,510
没错 很显然…
Yeah, well, obviously...

1248
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:23,930
星期四早上
Thursday morning.

1249
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,010
好的 我会空出时间的
Okay, I'll hold.

1250
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,850
- 劳伦！波士顿 星期四！ - 知道了！
- Lauren! Boston, Thursday!  - Got it!

1251
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:31,730
我把自己所有的网上信息都删除了的
I deleted every vestige of my online existence.

1252
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:32,940
但你没有替换它
You didn't replace it,

1253
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:34,240
谷歌上找不到克拉拉这个人
leaving a Clara-sized hole in Google,

1254
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,990
所以他们会做全面清查
which they flagged in due diligence.

1255
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,360
我替换了的
I did replace it.

1256
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:38,780
埃斯米！
Esme!

with Médecins Sans Frontiéres. It was solid.

1259
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:49,250
你为什么不告诉拉杰的事…
Why didn't you tell me about Raj...

1260
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:50,670
叫他马修就好
Just call him Matthew.

1261
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,170
我跟财政部的人核实过了
I checked with Finance.

1262
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:54,420
你请的演员并没有用公司的钱
Your actor wasn't paid from our account.

1263
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:56,130
你是自己掏钱请的他
You ran him out of your own pocket.

1264
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,380
别把太多事情告诉身边的人 这是实战经验
It's good practice to keep your circle small.

1265
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:01,140
在这个圈子里 不管你身在何处
In this town, no matter where you are,

1266
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,010
可能在你周围不到两米的地方 就有一个叛徒
you're never more than two feet away from a rat.

等等 这件事很重要啊
Wait, that's a huge deal.

1269
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,730
你不觉得我们该分享一下
You don't think we should share

1270
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:12,850
公众演讲的机会吗？
the public speaking a little?

1271
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,570
然后把你好不容易积累下来的名声都败掉？
And blow all the goodwill you've racked up?

1272
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,940
面对聚光灯我可能会不适应
I'm not sure I'm comfortable in the spotlight.

1273
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,020
还要回答各种媒体的提问
Doing all the press.

1274
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,580
那就给我适应起来 就这么说定了
Get comfortable, that ship has sailed.

1275
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,990
好的 星期四早上 我会去的
Hey, yes. Thursday morning, I'll be there.

Every day, 48 children or teens are shot.

1277
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:27,590
这还不是全世界范围的数据
That's not across the world, folks,

1278
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:29,050
仅仅在美国就有这么多受害者
that's right here in America.

1279
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,510
[新泽西州 爱迪生市]

[马萨诸塞州 新贝德福德]
居然自己找上门来了？
Knocking on doors, making house calls?

1283
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:40,220
[马萨诸塞州 新贝德福德]

1284
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:41,730
你花了多长时间 才找到这个地方？
How long did it take you to even get to this place?

1285
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:43,100
这足以证明我有多希望
Consider it a sign of how important

1286
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,720
你能加入我们了吧
it is that we get you on board.

在你这么长一段卓著的职业生涯中
In your long and distinguished career,

1289
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,890
你对女权一点贡献都没有
you've done precisely jack-shit for feminism.

1290
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,780
因为我对性别不感兴趣
Because gender doesn't interest me.

1291
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:54,190
你就差一个老二了
The only thing you're missing is a dick.

1292
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,020
如果你能出庭的话
I think your presence in the room

1293
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,000
[密歇根州 安阿伯市]

God willing, we can help protect

1296

自己身边的人 免受美国所经历的悲剧…

Don't hurl stats at me, I'm not a fucking journalist.

1304

你以为我不知道这些事？
You think I don't know all this?

1305

那你愿意加入吗？

1306

因为现在是把这些事说透的最佳时机
Because now would be a great time to tell them.

1312
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:38,610
- 什么意思？ - 寒暄小叙
- What do you mean?  - Small talk.

1313
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,940
就是毫无目的地随意闲聊
Idle nonsense of no import to anything.

1314
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,950
你把自己的社交互动外包了？
You outsource your social interactions?

1315
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,280
是啊 兴趣 爱好 还有… 孩子！

要想讨好一个为人父母的人
There's no better way to butter up a parent

1317

than to tell him how hot his kids are.

1318
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:50,320
我这就去办
On it.

1319
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:51,960
上次我们见面的时候 你最小的孩子
The last time we met, your youngest was

马上就要上常青藤了
knocking on the door of the Ivy League.

who have become so accustomed to your generous support,

1327
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:05,720
给他们来点刺激的惊喜 未尝不是一件好事
it wouldn't hurt to give them a short, sharp shock.

1328
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:08,890
不要让你的捐赠人多投钱 让他们少捐点
Your donors, don't ask for more. Ask for less.

1329
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:10,600
如果你们真的很支持希顿·哈里斯
If you feel strongly about Heaton-Harris,

1330
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:11,810
你们甚至可以提出
you could do worse

1331
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,480
如若有任何议员不支持
than to pledge to cut ties to any senator

1332
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:14,730
则取消与他的合作
who doesn't come out in favor.

1333
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,730
也就是说 我们既能推波助澜
So, what, we're turning the screw,

1334
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,610
同时又能省钱？
and saving money at the same time?

1335
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,650
我不愿待在一个每周都会发生
I don't want to live in a society where there

1336
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,490
校园枪击案的社会！
is a new school shooting every week!

1337
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:27,410
所以一旦开始投票
That is why when put to vote,

1338
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,880
我一定会毫无保留地支持希顿·哈里斯法案！
I will be supporting the Heaton-Harris Bill!

1339
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,370
是匿名捐赠的
It came in anonymously,

1340
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,700
但所有人都认为捐赠人是彭博
but everyone's thinking Bloomberg.

1341
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,540
五十万美元？这比我们的预算都还要高百分之十二！
Five hundred grand? That's over 12% of our budget!

1342
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:39,710
一个人捐这么多钱
If you were donating that much,

1343
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,880
为什么要匿名？
why would you do it anonymously?

1344
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:41,920
很简单
Obvious reason.

1345
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,390
- 什么？隐私？ - 不对
- What? Privacy?  - No.

1346
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:46,640
当你的身份被泄露的时候 你会显得很高尚
It makes you look noble when you leak your identity.

1347
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:49,060
我的天啊 你生来就这么愤世嫉俗吗？
Oh, my God. Were you born that cynical?

1348
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:51,100
这只是一个用来形容…
That is just a word to denote the absence...

1349
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:55,350
你是觉得我太天真烂漫了吗？好吧 我知道了
Of the naivety I so keenly exhibit? Yeah, right.

1350
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:59,690
三秒后开始直播
Back on in three, people.

1351
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,440
你从什么时候开始 不敢面对镜头了？
Since when were you camera-shy?

1352
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,030
发生什么了？长皱纹了？
What happened? You find a wrinkle?

1353
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,450
你可真是比尔·桑福德的走狗
If it isn't Bill Sandford's poodle.

1354
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,450
让我猜猜 被人套着绳子
Let me guess, on a tight leash,

1355
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:10,250
靠闻别人屁眼需求工作？
sniffing at his ass for business?

1356
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:12,040
如果不是你这么可笑
If you weren't such a joke,

1357
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:13,370
我们早就跟他合作了
we'd already have his business.

1358
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,580
这样如何？
So how about this?

1359
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,000
让小斯隆休息一天
Give Mini-Me a day off,

1360
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,380
我让你上次头版头条
and I'll give you a shot at the title.

1361
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:21,830
电视辩论直播赛 我和你
Live TV debate, you and me.

1362
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,170
你居然想给我直播时间
You must be desperate

1363
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:25,390
你肯定是憋坏了
if you're willing to give me airtime.

1364
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:26,720
我好好地修理你一顿
I kick your bony ass hard enough,

1365
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:28,100
比尔·桑福德就会意识到
Bill Sandford will realize

1366
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:29,640
他选择了我们 是多么明智
why he came to us in the first place.

1367
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:31,850
不对 你想用我的强势 让他担心
Uh-uh. You need me strong to make him worried.

1368
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:35,640
跟我正面交锋 你不会显得很强的
You're not looking so strong after a head-on with me.

1369
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,360
好吧 我答应你 帮你安排一场
All right. I'll grant you a job interview

1370
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:40,780
国家电视台的面试
on national television.

1371
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:43,450
你可以好好展示一下 你是多么忠诚的一条狗
You can show your master what a big, tough dog you are.

1372
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:54,410
我们接下来要讨论的事情
What we're about to discuss

1373
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:55,910
在办公室里只能通过代码
should only be referred to in code

1374
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,540
或者邮件的形式进行交流
in the office and over e-mail.

1375
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,910
我的前雇主们很会窃听和黑客技术
My ex-employers aren't beyond bugging and hacking.

1376
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,170
你觉得我们的会议室里有窃听器？
You think our conference room is wearing a wire?

1377
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:04,880
我们的目标人物是国家的参议员
We're gonna target a senator from a state

1378
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:06,720
所以容不得半点闪失
we have zero right to swing.

1379
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,260
天啊 你不是真的…
Oh, please, God, don't say...

1380
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:10,470
阿尔贝托·戈麦斯 共和党人 弗罗里达
Alberto Gomez, Republican, Florida.

1381
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,090
什么？
What'?

1382
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:13,560
我还以为你要说密苏里
I thought you were gonna say Missouri.

1383
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,640
弗罗里达不可能
Florida's preposterous.

1384
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:16,020
我只是乐观而已
I'm being optimistic.

1385
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:18,770
现在弗罗里达公众的意愿 对希顿·哈里斯是排斥的
Public opinion runs against Heaton-Harris in Florida.

1386
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,690
- 我们晚点再谈  - 在办公室里？
- Let's talk later.  - In the office?

1387
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:24,070
我要如何表达自己的异议？用旗语？
How do I register my dissent? By semaphore?

1388
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,440
艾利克斯 你负责广告横幅
Alex, you're in charge of ad banners,

1389
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:26,950
两点去智威汤逊
you have a 2:00 at JWT.

1390
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,740
上面要写两个电话号码
I want two phone pitches.

1391
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:30,240
克拉拉 布莱恩 劳伦 你们是第一小组
Clara, Brian, Lauren, you're one.

1392
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:32,660
辛西娅 埃斯米 弗兰克林 你们是第二小组
Cynthia, Esme, Franklin, you're two.

1393
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:35,370
罗斯 记录两组的数据 行动起来
Ross, get stats to both. Come on, get to it.

1394
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:41,750
你到底想干什么？
What the hell are you thinking?

1395
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,250
你应该相信我
That you should let me do my job.

1396
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:44,720
又不是针对科尔·克拉维茨
This ain't Cole Kravitz, damn it.

1397
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:47,090
我们的客户是一个非营利团体
Our client's a non-profit,

1398
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,970
不是什么钻钱眼里的企业
not some cashed-up conglomerate.

1399
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,800
我卑微地在外面摇首乞怜
I'm hiding in the bushes with my begging bowl,

1400
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:53,770
看到有钱人就往人身上扑
waiting to leap out at anyone who looks like money,

1401
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:55,140
而你现在却为了一个轻率的计划
and you're getting ready to set fire

1402
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:57,390
就想让这数百万给打水漂
to half a million dollars on some hare-brained...

1403
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:02,140
这种特务式的行动 着实极具吸引力
I mean this James Bond shit's endearingly wacky,

1404
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:04,320
但你如果真想扭转弗罗里达的意愿
but if you think you're seriously going to get

1405
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,200
你这么做就是无用功
any traction out of Florida, you're way out.

1406
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:09,120
鲁道夫 你当初请我来这里的时候
Rodolfo, it was explicit in your pitch to lure me here

1407
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,660
就应该很相信我的能力
that you held a certain degree of trust

1408
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,240
认为我可以引导好这次运动
in my ability to run this campaign.

1409
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:13,790
乔治 是我
George, it's me.

1410
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:15,160
我知道自己在做什么
I know what I'm doing.

1411
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:17,250
我们要谈谈弗罗里达的事
We need to talk about Florida.

1412
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,080
我从不轻率行事
And I don't do hare-brained.

1413
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:37,190
好球
Fucking A right.

1414
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,810
整个早上你都在球桌上狠狠修理我
From the way you been kicking my ass all morning,

1415
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,060
我不禁开始怀疑
I'm starting to think

1416
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:43,310
你不请自来 是不是就是想要我好看的
you invited yourself here just to kick my ass.

1417
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,990
我个人很支持希顿·哈里斯
I'm personally in favor of Heaton-Harris.

1418
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:51,240
我公开申明过 我的支持者也是
I've publicly declared, my voters are behind me.

1419
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:54,950
你来就是想教训我的？
Did you want to meet just to kick my ass?

1420
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:57,740
听着 你手里握有六票
Look, you're sitting on six votes.

1421
00:59:58,380 --> 00:59:59,580
桑福德并不蠢
Sandford's not a punk,

1422
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:01,710
他知道反对派就指望这几票翻身
he knows the opposition's counting on them.

1423
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:04,160
他也知道如果他们拿不到这六票
He also knows if they don't get them,

1424
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,790
他们的运动就结束了
their campaign will be over.

1425
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:08,680
那你想干什么？
So, what are you gonna do?

1426
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:10,090
信手走进我的俱乐部
Walk into my club,

1427
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,460
在台球桌上痛扁我一局
bend me over a green baize table,

1428
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,550
然后高谈阔论自由一番？
and give me the spiel about freedom?

1429
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:16,010
如果让自由主义者得逞
About how, if the liberals get their way,

1430
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:17,180
再过个几百年
in a couple of hundred years,

1431
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:18,810
第二修正案会连我们
the Second Amendment will enshrine

1432
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,480
拿棒球棒的权利都要干预了？
our rights to bear baseball bats?

1433
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:22,650
不 这番话得由你去跟
No, that's the argument you're gonna make

1434
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:24,390
你“蓝狗联盟”的朋友们讲
to your friends in the Blue Dog Coalition

1435
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:26,400
你要告诉他们 你改变阵营了
when you tell them you're changing your position.

1436
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:32,740
比尔·桑福德在考虑支持一个新的候选人
Bill Sandford's thinking about backing a new candidate.

1437
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:36,200
跟他同一阵营 非常有前途的西班牙人
One of their own. A real up-and-comer. Hispanic.

1438
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:39,370
收到了八所常青藤大学的录取单
Got offers from eight Ivy League schools.

1439
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:41,040
常青藤？
Ivy League schools?

1440
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,420
你有看过我的支持率吗？
Have you seen my approval ratings, Pat?

1441
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,210
他不是要对抗你
No, he's not running against you.

1442
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:47,920
而是对抗你的儿子
He's running against your son.

1443
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:57,060
枪支管制反对派需要你的支持 汉克
The gun lobby wants your support, Hank.

1444
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:01,390
他们知道你儿子在竞选密歇根议员
They know your boy's running for Michigan.

1445
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,800
他们会给他精挑细选一位对手
They'll handpick an opponent.

1446
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,890
确保他拿到选票
Back him to the hilt.

1447
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:07,680
我试过让桑德福别这么干 但是…
I tried to talk Sandford out of it, but...

1448
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:08,940
胡说八道 康纳斯 你说不定
Bullshit, Connors, you probably

1449
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:10,360
就是那个唆使他这么干的人 你个混蛋
put him up to it, you motherfucker.

1450
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:11,810
对于支持率的事情
About those approval ratings.

1451
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:15,570
你可以相信自己
You can go either way.

1452
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:20,120
或者悄悄地改变阵营 保护你的儿子
Quietly recant, protect your son.

1453
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,620
桑福德不会忘记的
Sandford won't forget it.

1454
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:26,620
但如果你让他失望了…
You disappoint him...

1455
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:29,750
他更不会忘记
He won't forget that, either.

1456
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:37,760
匹兹堡怎么样了？
So, how was Pittsburgh?

1457
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,010
你是联邦调查局的吗？
What are you, a Fed?

1458
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:43,270
中大西洋女子协会执法机关的主席
The President of the Mid-Atlantic Association of Women

1459
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,690
打电话过来感谢你请她吃的午饭
in Law Enforcement called to say thanks for lunch.

1460
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,890
我怎么不知道她们也是计划中的一部分
I wasn't aware they were part of our plan.

1461
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:50,890
反正吃得又不贵
It wasn't JWT.

1462
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:52,270
只吃了三十分钟
It was a 30-minute lunch.

1463
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:53,700
她们也不是计划的一部分
They're not a part of our plan,

1464
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:55,990
所以我才没请她吃大餐
which is why it wasn't JWT.

1465
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,660
就不允许我有自己的社交生活？
Am I not allowed a social life?

1466
01:01:57,790 --> 01:01:58,950
我还以为你没有
I didn't know you had one.

1467
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:00,780
对于一个连会话主题
As someone who has her underlings

1468
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:02,280
都要让自己下属准备的人来说
root for conversational topics.

1469
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,370
我的朋友圈很小罢了
I maintain a small circle of allies.

1470
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:06,170
是吗 只有警察和护士？
Uh-huh. Cops and nurses?

1471
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:09,710
如果你想知道全部细节的话 我到时候写张清单给你
Well, I can provide a list if you require full disclosure.

1472
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:13,590
我们开始吧
So, grand unveiling.

1473
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,430
- 你也来吗？ - 我们有更重要的问题要解决
- You coming?  - We got a bigger problem.

1474
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,430
你在跑来跑去 跟别人聚餐的时候
While you've been jetting around the country for lunch,

1475
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:20,010
我们的对手可一点都没松懈
our opponents have been doing their job.

1476
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:22,350
汉克·巴杰利 “蓝狗”的主席
Hank Badgley, Chairman of the Blue Dog,

1477
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,850
他控制了…
who controls the votes of...

1478
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:26,310
六个议员的选票 我知道这个人 他是站在我们这边的
Six Senators, I know who he is. He's in our pocket.

1479
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,980
真的？你真以为这样？
Really? That what you think?

1480
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:31,640
他之前是支持我们的 但现在来了个一百八十度大转弯
He was on board, but he just did a 180.

1481
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:34,100
他说他想等等看
Says he wants to wait and see.

1482
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:37,650
“等等看”顶多算九十度转弯吧
"Wait and see" is more like a 90.

1483
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,910
我们追随的议员根本就没把这当正事
We're chasing Senators who are in play.

1484
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,200
我们不能损失已经锁定了的七票
We can't afford to lose seven votes we had locked.

1485
01:02:42,370 --> 01:02:43,580
这个缺口是没办法填补的
We won't recover.

1486
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,740
我们没有他宜哲支持的视频吗？
We have him on camera pledging support?

1487
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:46,820
当然有
Absolutely.

1488
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:49,040
那就让他看看我们的厉害
Then we'll have to make him feel it.

1489
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,050
谢谢
Thank you.

1490
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:07,600
艾利克斯 这些横幅真不错
Alex, these banners are good.

1491
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:09,730
你能再说一遍吗
Could you say that again

1492
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:11,190
这遍别说得那么惊讶？
and sound a little less surprised?

1493
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:13,400
等等 这不对啊
Hold on, this can't be right.

1494
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:15,940
- 戈麦斯议员…  - 我们不去弗罗里达了
- Senator Gomez...  - We're not going to Florida.

1495
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,150
什么？
What?

1496
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:20,530
放弃弗罗里达
Florida's out.

1497
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,030
但你说过我们要去弗罗里达
But you said that we were going to Florida

1498
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,070
说服戈麦斯…
to swing Gomez...

1499
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:26,450
所有人翻到第九个标签的位置
Everyone turn to Tab 9, please.

1500
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,500
我这里什么都没有
I don't have anything at Tab 9.

1501
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,350
保安 封锁辛西娅·格林的办公桌
Security, lock down Cynthia Green's desk.

1502
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,060
拿走她的文件和硬盘
Secure her files and her hard drives,

1503
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:52,400
护送她离开公司
and escort her off the premises.

1504
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:54,900
你的黑莓手机拿出来
Your Blackberry, now.

1505
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,610
赶快！
Now!

1506
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:01,940
快点走
Let's go.

1507
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:03,740
他向我提供合作邀请
He offered me partnership track.

1508
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,370
那祝你好运
Good luck with that.

1509
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,250
清理办公室
Clear the office.

1510
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:09,960
快点！所有人都出去
Come on, come on, come on! Everybody out.

1511
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:16,620
我要把这个地方彻底清查一下
I'll have the place swept for taps.

1512
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:19,630
听起来也像特务的活儿
Sounds like James Bond shit to me.

1513
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:21,460
我们晚点再谈这个问题
We will talk about this later.

1514
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:25,890
所有人 都离开这栋楼！
Come on, everybody, clear the building!

1515
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:28,930
快走！都出去！
Let's go! Out! Come on!

1516
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:41,480
真不敢相信去弗罗里达
I can't believe the whole

1517
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:43,270
找戈麦斯这整件事都是个幌子
Gomez-Florida thing was a ruse.

1518
01:04:43,490 --> 01:04:45,330
我们出其不意地选择进攻科罗拉多
We're coming out of left field to take Colorado

1519
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:48,080
让他们根本反应不过来
before they figure out which hole they got screwed in.

1520
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:49,450
她怎么能这么做？
How could she do that?

1521
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:51,910
谁会有这种想法？
How does someone even think like that?

1522
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,240
或许是她太天真了
Maybe in her naivety,

1523
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:54,920
以为这样对她的职业生涯有帮助吧
she figured it'd be good for her career.

1524
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:58,620
我说的不是辛西娅
I wasn't talking about Cynthia.

1525
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:14,730
早上好
Morning.

1526
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,600
请坐
Please take a seat.

1527
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:21,360
我们不是说做不到
We're not saying it can't be done.

1528
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:22,900
只是风险很大
But it's risky.

1529
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:25,110
- 我们只有一次机会  - 嘿！
- We only get one shot.  - Hey!

1530
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:28,540
你被跟踪了？
Were you followed?

1531
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:29,700
很明显
Evidently.

1532
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:32,960
让他进来
Let him in.

1533
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:34,420
你能庄严发誓
Do you solemnly swear

1534
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:35,500
接下来所说的话
that you will tell the truth,

1535
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:37,290
全部是事实真相 只有真话
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,

1536
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:39,040
否则会受到作伪证的惩罚？
upon pains and penalties of perjury?

1537
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:42,680
我发誓
I do.

1538
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:48,430
请说出你的全名
State your full name, please.

1539
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:50,220
快看啊
Well, look at this.

1540
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:52,720
鲁道夫·维托里奥·施密特
Rodolfo Vittorio Schmidt.

1541
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:57,690
这部车应该不是改装的雪佛兰吧？
I'm guessing this gear ain't for tuning my '69 Chevy?

1542
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,690
鲁道夫 这是我的非官方支持团队
Rodolfo, my unofficial support team.

1543
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:03,110
大山姆
Big Sam.

1544
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:04,610
小山姆
Little Sam.

1545
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:07,740
在你和斯隆女士共事的这段时间以来
During the time that you worked alongside Miss Sloane,

1546
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,910
你们有没有就运用
did you hold any discussions

1547
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,030
非法监控技术
pertaining to the use

1548
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,910
进行过讨论？
of illegal surveillance techniques?

1549
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:17,840
你们团队有多大规模？
So, how big is your organization?

1550
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,500
我们一共有六个人 四个执行外务
Well, there are six of us, four are out on assignment.

1551
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:22,920
- 那你们是前…  - 国家安全局员工
- And you're ex...  - NSA.

1552
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:25,340
巴杰利突然改变了阵营
Badgley is flip-flopping.

1553
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:26,970
最快让他回心转意的方法
But, quickest way to get him in line

1554
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:28,340
就是挖掘出他的丑闻
is to mine for sordid details,

1555
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:30,340
并且让他知道 我们掌握了这些信息
and then let him know we're in possession of them.

1556
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:33,560
施密特先生 你们有吗？
Mr. Schmidt, did you?

1557
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:35,600
有过 议员
Yes, Senator, we did.

1558
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:37,760
他们是通过何种方法
And what means did they have at their disposal

1559
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:40,360
实施这种监控手段的？
to carry out these surveillance practices?

1560
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:42,940
标准全天二十四小时的音像监控
Standard 24-hour video and audio surveillance,

1561
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:44,610
包括黑入手机和网上账户
cell phone and online account hacking,

1562
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:49,070
实施位置跟踪 再加上我们最新的科技
location tracking, and, with our latest tech,

1563
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:52,860
近距离窃听 何时何地都可以
close-quarters audio, anytime, anyplace.

1564
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,920
你有听说过“不被察觉的窥探者”吗？
You ever hear the expression "Fly on the wall"?

1565
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:59,370
来看看我们最新型的窃听技术
Well, meet the cutting edge in eavesdropping.

1566
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:01,960
是只蟑螂
It's a cockroach.

1567
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:03,870
可以用这个把它变换为
Which can be retro-fitted

1568
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:07,510
可受控的机器蟑螂
as a cybernetic robo-roach with this.

1569
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:11,380
我们把电极用胶水黏在它的触须上
We glue electrodes to its antennae,

1570
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:12,720
在胸腔上穿孔
perforate the thorax,

1571
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:14,850
这样就能控制它的运动轨迹
and we can control its movement remotely.

1572
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:16,600
别给动物保护协会打电话 施密特
Don't call PETA, Schmidt.

1573
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:18,220
这些小家伙可以飞檐走壁
These guys can crawl under doors,

1574
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,680
无孔不入 根本不会被人察觉
into crevices, bags, completely undetected.

1575
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,610
几个星期不进食 仍然保持很高的活力
They can go weeks without food and still be mobile.

1576
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,820
那你对这些可能性是如何反应的？
And how did you react to the possibility of all this?

1577
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:30,860
我告诉她这很令人惊异 也很有创意
I told her it was mind-boggling, ingenious,

1578
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:33,240
但在道德上是很令人反感 且不能接受的
morally repugnant and completely unacceptable.

1579
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:35,040
砰！
Boo!

1580
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,790
你现在说的是勒索
You're talking about blackmailing

1581
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,490
一个美国参议员
a United States Senator.

1582
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,170
如果这个消息被泄露出去 你知道会造成怎样的损害吗？
Have you any idea of the damage if this ever came out?

1583
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:44,580
不能重新赢回巴杰利 这造成的损害更大
No more than the damage done if we don't get Badgley back.

1584
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:47,210
你们的手段和能力
Without prejudice to the undoubtedly

1585
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,760
毫无疑问 非常一流
stellar job that you guys do.

1586
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,220
但我们的公司有自己的
Our firm has certain standards

1587
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:53,050
规定和原则 我不想轻易越界
below which I'm not prepared to stoop.

1588
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:56,180
让我出去
Let me out of here.

1589
01:07:57,150 --> 01:07:58,230
施密特
Schmidt.

1590
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:00,520
想其他办法
Find another way.

1591
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,730
密歇根议员 汉克·巴杰利
It was a rude awakening

1592
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:10,360
突然醒悟 今天他被一群有组织的
for Michigan Senator, Hank Badgley, today

1593
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:14,700
枪支管制支持者 从他家里一直围堵到…
as he was tailed from his home to his workplace by this...

1594
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,540
这他妈什么情况？
What the fuck is that?

1595
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:18,410
…他的办公室
Organized by gun safety campaigners

1596
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:19,790
他们想要议员就因为受到
in response to what they perceive

1597
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,040
卑鄙之人的影响
as a U-turn on his support...

1598
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:24,550
这是真的吗… 我他妈真不敢相信！
Can you believe... I do not fucking believe!

1599
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:29,010
…而转变立场一事作出回应
In the shadow of a giant rat.

1600
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,210
各个国家新闻的专题都在播这件事
It's on all of the national news outlets.

1601
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:35,510
她到底是怎么做到的？
How the hell did she manage that?

1602
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,140
不是她 是群众自己的选择
She didn't. They swing left all on their own.

1603
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:39,730
这件事都有推特主题了
It has its own Twitter feed.

1604
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:41,180
什么？
Huh?

1605
01:08:43,530 --> 01:08:44,810
“叛徒”
The rat.

1606
01:08:45,070 --> 01:08:47,780
说真的 有人在背后搞鬼促使我改变立场
Really, I think that this whole rat business

1607
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:50,610
这种说法 其实只是一个很不幸的误会
is little more than an unfortunate misunderstanding.

1608
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:53,070
我是参议院中第一个公开申明
I was one of the first members of the senate

1609
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,360
支持希顿·哈里斯的成员
to lend my support to Heaton-Harris.

1610
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,780
我一直都觉得这条法案
I've always maintained that

1611
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:58,410
对公共安全有很重要的指导意义
the Bill is integral to public safety,

1612
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:01,080
所以我对它的支持将不会动摇
and my support for it is unwavering.

1613
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:03,080
现在 我希望大家能
Now, I sincerely hope that

1614
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:04,870
忘掉这一切的流言蜚语…
we can get past all this silliness...

1615
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,300
还有三名“蓝狗”的议员
Three more Blue Dog Senators

1616
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:08,460
在下周要举办新闻发布会
have press conferences scheduled for next week.

1617
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:09,840
一定要再三强调
Keep hammering the point

1618
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:11,840
我们的本意不是财产没收
that we're not arguing for confiscation.

1619
01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:13,340
希顿·哈里斯的重点是在于…
Heaton-Harris is about stopping...

1620
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:14,800
阻止罪犯和精神病患者
Criminals and psychopaths.

1621
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:16,340
我现在已经上手了 莉斯
Yeah, I'm a pro at this now, Liz.

1622
01:09:16,430 --> 01:09:18,220
里面见
I'll see you in there.

1623
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:21,140
你是什么时候知道有人泄密的？
So you knew there was a leak from when?

1624
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:22,440
- 你说什么？ - 辛西娅
- Sorry?  - Cynthia.

1625
01:09:22,570 --> 01:09:24,810
你是什么时候怀疑 有人泄密的？
When did you start to suspect there was a leak?

1626
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:26,690
美国医生联盟 凑资晚会之后
Uh, after the UAPD fundraiser.

1627
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:28,520
然后你就让私人侦探去跟踪她？
And you had her followed by a Pl?

1628
01:09:28,650 --> 01:09:30,270
你怎么知道是她？
How did you know it was her?

1629
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:31,690
什么？
Sorry?

1630
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:33,820
泄密的人 你派人监视辛西娅
The leak, you had Cynthia watched.

1631
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:35,570
你怎么知道是她？
How did you know it was her?

1632
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:37,820
我不知道
I didn't.

1633
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:40,750
我们全部人都被你监视了？
You had us all watched?

1634
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:43,080
您好
Howdy.

1635
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:46,420
卡尔·斯奈德 我是做银行保险的
Cal Sneider, banking and actuarial.

1636
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,080
我们之前见过
I'm sure we've been introduced,

1637
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:50,120
不过我忘了你的名字了
but your name escapes me.

1638
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:51,760
抱歉 你认错人了
I'm sorry, you have the wrong person.

1639
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:53,130
我绝对没有
I'm pretty sure I don't.

1640
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:54,800
我这人认人很准的
Have a good memory for faces.

1641
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:56,640
像你这么漂亮 我更不会忘了
This one I wouldn't readily forget.

1642
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:59,090
真的 斯奈德先生
Really, Mr. Sneider,

1643
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,310
你一定是认错人了
I've no idea who you think I am.

1644
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,810
我先走了
Excuse me.

1645
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:13,030
你知道现在这个时候
Uh-huh. You know we're not really

1646
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,610
我们没必要进行这段对话 对吧？
supposed to be having this conversation, right?

1647
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:16,610
俄勒冈州一半的土地 都是受联邦政府保护的
Half of Oregon is protected Federal parkland.

1648
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:18,030
他们没办法拉拢
They can't develop it.

1649
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,830
那边的州预算都是来自于伐木税收
So, state budgets come from logging revenues.

1650
01:10:19,870 --> 01:10:20,910
- 这我知道…  - 莉斯？
- got it...  - Liz?

1651
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,070
你现在先不要想这些 这次辩论与此无关
Whatever clearing your head looks like, this isn't it.

1652
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:25,250
所以说伐木工是非常重要的人群
So, loggers are a very influential group.

1653
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:26,620
打扰一下！
Excuse me!

1654
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:28,500
能来个人帮她化下妆吗？
Can someone have her makeup done, too, please?

1655
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:29,630
我又不上电视！
I'm not a part of this!

1656
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,250
摄影棚到处都是摄像机 你也要注意形象
You're a public figure in a room full of cameras.

1657
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,370
是她吗？
IS that her?

1658
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:35,250
莉斯？
Liz?

1659
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:37,920
快叫布莱恩去联系那些伐木工
Hey, we have to get Bryan on these loggers.

1660
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,270
我们马上去处理那些伐木工！
We're on top of the goddamn loggers!

1661
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:40,260
你先给我集中注意！
Just clear your head!

1662
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:41,300
稍等一下
One moment.

1663
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:42,980
别胡思乱想 照我说的做
Clear your head, like I told you.

1664
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:44,350
喂？
Hello?

1665
01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:49,350
- 好了  - 欢迎你 斯隆女士
- Fine.  - Ms. Sloane, welcome.

1666
01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:52,230
帕特 请坐
Pat. Please, take a seat.

1667
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:54,110
我知道星期五就是提交日期了
I know Friday's Filing Day

1668
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,310
你们组织的运动马上就要结束了
and your campaign will be over,

1669
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:56,480
但如果你认为我会就此放水的话
but if you're thinking I'm gonna go easy,

1670
01:10:56,530 --> 01:10:57,520
那你就想多了
I can't do that.

1671
01:10:57,910 --> 01:11:00,570
这是现场直播 注意你们的用词
This is live TV, so no colorful language.

1672
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:02,490
居然拉我的下属下水
Bullshit job offers to my staff,

1673
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:04,070
你可真是无耻到新下限了
you've plumbed new depths.

1674
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:05,780
那个自以为是的小姑娘？得了吧
A giant inflatable rodent? Please.

1675
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,080
你毁了那个女孩的前程
You ruined that girl's career.

1676
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:10,500
好了 都给我闭嘴 开始吧！
All right, shut up, the both of you. Let's go!

1677
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,800
大家好 我是乔恩·欧尼尔
Hello, America, I'm Jon O'Neill,

1678
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:20,840
欢迎收看《华盛顿周报》特别版节目
welcome to a special edition of This Week In Washington.

1679
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:23,810
枪支！多点还是少点好？
Guns! More or Less?

1680
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:26,770
去年一共发生了三百七十二起大型的枪击案
There were 372 mass shootings last year,

1681
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:28,390
六十五起校园枪击案
64 school shootings,

1682
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,390
在美国一共有超过三亿支枪支…
and there are over 300 million guns in our country...

1683
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:33,150
你以前跟康纳斯共事过？
You used to work with Connors?

1684
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,400
整整四年
Four years.

1685
01:11:34,570 --> 01:11:39,280
满嘴脏话 出其不意 但非常有效率
Foul-mouthed, unexpected, and very effective.

1686
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:42,990
如果要想背景调查落到实处
If background checks are to be of any use,

1687
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,740
就应该对所有枪支买卖实行 而不是其中的一些
they should apply to all gun sales, not just some.

1688
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:48,080
这难道不是希顿·哈里斯所推祟的吗？
Isn't that what Heaton-Harris is proposing?

1689
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:51,840
没错 这条法案确实扩大了枪支管理的范围
Precisely. The bill expands the scope of gun regulation,

1690
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,210
但它同时也是对美国宪法
and it's yet another affront

1691
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:55,040
所规定的人民合法权利的公开冒犯
to Americans' Constitutional rights.

1692
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:57,540
不对 这条法案非常有效地
No, the bill closes an absurd loophole

1693
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,000
阻止了恐怖分子黑名单上的人
which allows people on terrorist watch-lists

1694
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:02,310
在想买枪的时候 不用接受任何检查的漏洞
to buy guns without any checks whatsoever.

1695
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:04,350
这是对权利政府所规定的的
It's an incursion into individual liberty

1696
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,970
公民自由的一种亵渎…
by an all-powerful government...

1697
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:08,520
- 什么 就像驾照一样？ - 驾照？
- What, like drivers' licenses?  - Drivers' licenses?

1698
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:10,270
只有在经受严格的理论教育
It's illegal to operate a car

1699
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,440
以及通过实践考试的人
without going through rigorous

1700
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:13,100
才能开车 否则就是违法的
theoretical and practical assessments.

1701
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,440
- 这条规则 很显然…  - “河豚厨师”
- That's a clear constraint...  - Fugu chefs.

1702
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:17,480
…是对公民自由驱车权利的限制
On the freedom of individuals to drive cars,

1703
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:20,030
- 或者开飞机也是一个道理  - 快说“河豚厨师”
- or pilots to fly planes.  - Come on. Fugu chefs.

1704
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:22,910
在日本 一名厨师必须经过七年的训练
You know, in Japan, chefs train for seven years

1705
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,250
才能为客人准备一种带毒的鱼
before they're allowed to serve

1706
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:25,710
其名叫河豚
a poisonous blowfish called fug...

1707
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:26,780
真棒！
Yes!

1708
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:27,950
这跟做背景调查
What does any of this

1709
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,330
有什么关系？
have to do with background checks?

1710
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:30,910
这是个好问题
Is a fair question.

1711
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,160
在座的各位
Does anyone in this room

1712
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:34,380
有人觉得政府应该废除驾照吗？
think the government should abolish drivers' licenses?

1713
01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:35,910
- 这太荒唐了  - 为什么？
- That's absurd.  - Why?

1714
01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:38,250
驾照也是一种政府对公民自由权利的限制
They're a government incursion into individual liberty.

1715
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,800
我们接受它 是因为它很有道理
We accept them because they make sense.

1716
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:42,510
对于越危险的机器
The more dangerous the machinery,

1717
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,300
就应该有更严格的测试
the more rigorous the tests should be.

1718
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:46,170
我觉得我们可以把 对危险机器的定义
I think we can extend our definition

1719
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:48,980
扩展到半自动武器上来
of dangerous machinery to semi-automatic firearms.

1720
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:51,020
但是宪法的第二修正案并没有
Except that the Second Amendment to the Constitution

1721
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:53,400
保护公众驾车的权利
doesn't guarantee the right to drive cars,

1722
01:12:53,530 --> 01:12:57,110
或者操纵机器 亦或是处理河豚
or operate machinery or serve blowfish for that matter.

1723
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,280
但它保护了公民买枪和持枪的权利
It guarantees the right to keep and bear arms.

1724
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:02,400
是你最近没有好好翻阅吧
Perhaps you haven't read it lately.

1725
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:03,950
修正案中没有任何
Nothing in the bill

1726
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,900
限制公民买枪及持枪的合法权利
infringes the rights of the people to keep and bear arms.

1727
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,490
第二修正案签署于
The Second Amendment was signed in a time

1728
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,360
一个平均年龄只有三十八岁的年代
where the average life expectancy was 38,

1729
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:13,040
而且在那个年代 我们的开国元勋
and it was common practice for our Founding Fathers

1730
01:13:13,130 --> 01:13:16,590
如若发生冲突 他们都愿意选择通过战争来解决
to resolve their differences at dawn in a gunfight.

1731
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:19,630
那条法案或许适用于 当时的世界格局和社会状态
What may have been perfectly sensible in those alien times

1732
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:22,290
但对于现在处理问题的方式 未必适用
is wholly inadequate to solve the problems of the present.

1733
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:24,170
这不是预演好的辩词 她在干什么？
That's not the rebuttal, what's she doing?

1734
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:25,670
美国宪法经受住了
The United States Constitution

1735
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:27,260
时间的考验
has stood the test of time.

1736
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:31,010
它给公民授予的权利是不可置疑的
It's authored to confer unimpeachable rights,

1737
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:32,350
而这种效应不会随着
which don't change depending

1738
01:13:32,770 --> 01:13:34,440
时代的变迁而被撼动
on which way the Wind's blowing.

1739
01:13:34,690 --> 01:13:36,400
这种权利也能让别有意图的
It's so authored with the specific intent

1740
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:37,650
比如全世界
of keeping at bay

1741
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:39,440
像伊丽莎白·斯隆这种
the Elizabeth Sloanes of this world,

1742
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:41,480
想拿宪法擦屁股的人干瞪眼
who wanna wipe their asses with the Constitution...

1743
01:13:41,530 --> 01:13:42,650
好了 我们先…
Okay, let's...

1744
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:44,400
…他们的主观意念 是无法动摇它的
and replace it with their own judgment,

1745
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:45,870
因为他们自以为比这个伟大国家的
because she knows better than

1746
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,660
开国元勋更了解这个世界
the Founding Fathers of this great nation.

1747
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,790
没有什么是不可置疑的 包括宪法
Nothing is unimpeachable, not even the Constitution.

1748
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:54,080
刚刚你迫不及待 用来反驳我的权利声明
It's ironic that the very statement of rights

1749
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:55,670
事实上
you're so quick to invoke

1750
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,670
都只是修正案里的条目
is in fact an Amendment.

1751
01:13:58,010 --> 01:13:59,620
抱歉纠正一下 伊丽莎白
I may not like it either, Elizabeth,

1752
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:01,670
那是第二修正案
but it's the Second Amendment.

1753
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,170
言论自由 宗教自由 新闻自由 这些是公认的
Comes right after freedom of speech, religion, and press,

1754
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:07,130
搜索自由稍有限制
and somewhere before freedom from search

1755
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,220
是否做对自己不利的证明 也有选择的自由
and from having to testify against yourself.

1756
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,890
这些东西组合在一起
They're all sort of bunched together.

1757
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:12,390
构成了人权法案
It's called the Bill of Rights.

1758
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:14,730
- 你准备怎么回答？ - 没这个必要
- How do you get around that?  - We don't need to.

1759
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:16,480
最高法院已经做出表态
Supreme Court already made it clear

1760
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:18,100
针对公众持枪的权利
that the right to own a gun

1761
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:19,810
需要经受合法的限制
is subject to lawful restriction.

1762
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:21,440
其中一条就是背景调查
One of those is background checks.

1763
01:14:21,610 --> 01:14:24,700
全面的背景调查就是一种侵犯
Universal background checks are an infringement.

1764
01:14:25,410 --> 01:14:27,280
“不容侵犯的部分”这句话
What part of "shall not be infringed"

1765
01:14:27,410 --> 01:14:28,570
你没看到吗？
don't you get?

1766
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:31,620
我觉得那是里面最无力 也是最令人厌恶的
I get that that's the weakest, most mind-numbing retort

1767
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,700
反驳论点
in your impoverished arsenal.

1768
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,380
毫无论点可言
Sort of a last refuge for those

1769
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:36,620
根本无法令人信服
with no real argument at all.

1770
01:14:36,710 --> 01:14:37,750
你现在说的
You're talking about

1771
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:39,090
可是美国宪法
the United States Constitution.

1772
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,680
如果他们能提出合理的论据
If they could produce a rational winning argument,

1773
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,800
我很乐意改变我的想法
I'd gladly migrate to their side,

1774
01:14:43,890 --> 01:14:46,750
但单纯只是“因为宪法里 圣经上 还有占星术”
but "because it says so in the Constitution,

1775
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:50,930
“是这么说的” 就盲目追崇 这根本就不能让人信服！
"the Bible, or my horoscope," it's not a winning argument!

1776
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:52,100
那只是自我高潮
It's a ripcord.

1777
01:14:52,230 --> 01:14:54,440
就好像一个穿着妈妈裙子
An intellectual equivalent of a yellow,

1778
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,480
胆怯 只知道尿裤子的弱智
pant-pissing wimp cowering behind mommy's skirt.

1779
01:14:57,570 --> 01:15:00,060
- 我们先进段广告吧  - 不 我们继续！
- Why don't we bring this back.  - No, no, no. Let's not!

1780
01:15:00,150 --> 01:15:02,020
我们为何不问问那些母亲们
Why don't we ask all the mothers out there

1781
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:04,820
他们的孩子被武装反社会份子枪杀
who lost their children to an armed sociopath,

1782
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:07,190
问问她们觉得 宪法规定的
if they believe in his unimpeachable

1783
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:09,660
且不可置疑的持枪权利 是否合理？
Constitutional right to bear arms?

1784
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:11,360
为什么不问问那个躲在
Why not ask the terrified girl

1785
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:13,490
门卫储物室 眼睁睁看着自己的同学
who locked herself in a janitor's closet

1786
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:14,790
被惨杀的
at Bloomington High,

1787
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,040
被吓得魂飞魄散的
forced to listen

1788
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:18,330
布卢明顿中学的女孩？
as her peers were being massacred?

1789
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,580
去啊 问问她！
Go ahead, ask her!

1790
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:22,910
她的名字叫作埃斯米·曼尼克瑞安
Her name is Esme Manucharian.

1791
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:26,510
她就站在那里！
She's standing right there!

1792
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,020
我的天啊 莉斯
Jesus Christ, Liz.

1793
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:36,560
好了 时间到！
Okay, time out!

1794
01:15:36,650 --> 01:15:38,640
我们先休息一下 广告之后回来
We're going to take a break, and when we come back,

1795
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:41,150
希望到时候两位能
maybe these two will stop playing

1796
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,860
停止开黄腔 围绕实事进行讨论
Patty Cake and the blowfish really come off.

1797
01:15:43,950 --> 01:15:45,530
马上回来！
Be right back!

1798
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:10,750
如果只是一时冲动
I won't insult your intelligence

1799
01:16:10,850 --> 01:16:12,880
我是不会把你的信息透露出去 让你难堪的
by claiming that came out in the heat of the moment.

1800
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:19,180
什么时候计划的？
How far back?

1801
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:23,400
我开始适应面对媒体的时候？
Once I started getting used to all the media?

1802
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:28,610
原来一开始都是你计划好的
Okay. Day one.

1803
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:31,570
哇
Wow.

1804
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,610
那晚吃晚餐的时候…
At dinner that night...

1805
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,630
你问我如果这是决定成败的关键
You asked me if I'd go public

1806
01:16:42,710 --> 01:16:45,170
我是否愿意公开这件事
if it was the difference between victory and defeat.

1807
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:50,210
如果我当时说不呢？
What if I'd said no?

1808
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:53,640
你还是会说出来？
Would you still have done it?

1809
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:55,850
可能会
Probably.

1810
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,470
我受聘是来赢的
I was hired to win,

1811
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:00,390
我有责任
and I have a responsibility

1812
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,140
动用身边的一切资源
to use whatever resource I have.

1813
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:04,480
这件事能让我们博得很多关注
The press we're going to get from this,

1814
01:17:04,530 --> 01:17:06,480
如果不说出来 就是玩忽职守了
it's practically a dereliction of duty not to use it.

1815
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:08,270
就这样？我只是你的“资源”？
That's it? I'm a "resource"?

1816
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:09,700
专业上来讲 是的
Professionally, yes.

1817
01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:15,150
我理解你有自己的情感 有自己的生活
I understand you have feelings, and a life,

1818
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:16,860
但我对它们并不负有责任
but I have no duty to them.

1819
01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:20,490
我只对这个案子负责 如果两者发生冲突
I have a duty to the cause, and if the two conflict,

1820
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:23,040
我只能选择更重要的那个
there will only ever be one winner.

1821
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:28,040
感谢你的直言直语
Well, hooray for straight talk.

1822
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:31,590
好了
Okay.

1823
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:34,760
准备好 埃斯米 我们需要发布一条声明
Get ready, Esme. Network wants a statement.

1824
01:17:34,930 --> 01:17:38,060
把妆补好 我们要手挽手走出去
Re-apply your makeup. We'll walk out arm-in-arm.

1825
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:39,980
简短有力就行 不用接受提问
We'll be brief. No questions.

1826
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:43,600
今晚 让我们给大家点好戏看看
Tonight, we'll leave them wanting more.

1827
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,740
首先
First of all,

1828
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:52,910
我先声明 我把自己的一生都贡献给了
I want to make it clear that I have dedicated my life

1829
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:56,740
讨论枪支安全的议题 因为现在的系统是残缺的
to gun safety issues because the current system is broken.

1830
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:58,490
这是我很理智的判断
That's a rational judgment.

1831
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,200
而不是感性使然
Not an emotional one.

1832
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,290
我是一九九八年
I am a survivor

1833
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:10,420
布卢明顿中学惨案的幸存者
of the Bloomington High School massacre of 1998.

1834
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:15,220
很多年来 我一直都压抑自己的痛苦
For years, I sought to hide the pain and the trauma,

1835
01:18:15,310 --> 01:18:16,590
害怕再回想起那时的经历
for fear of having to relive it.

1836
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:19,260
但我逐渐意识到
But I've come to realize

1837
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:23,430
还有成百上千枪支暴力的受害者
that the thousands of people affected by gun violence

1838
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,940
我们应该站出来 让自己的声音被听到
need to stand up and be counted.

1839
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,940
他们需要一个能
They need a representative

1840
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:31,990
为这个团体发声的代表
who can speak out for what they have endured.

1841
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:33,860
给桑福德打电话
Let's call Sandford.

1842
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:35,780
一个能理解他们遭遇的人…
Someone who can relate their experience...

1843
01:18:35,830 --> 01:18:37,160
我们或许有赢的机会
There might be life in this yet.

1844
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:38,540
…能把它分享给社会大众的人
To the public at large.

1845
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:15,770
你真是个混蛋 伊丽莎白
You're a piece of work, Elizabeth.

1846
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:23,370
如果为了赢 你想把自己往火坑里推
If you want to set yourself on fire

1847
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,490
我不阻拦你 但你居然这么对埃斯米？
to service your need to win, I won't protest, but Esme?

1848
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:30,410
我只在乎结果
The end is my concern.

1849
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:32,920
你们这些崇尚自由主义的好好先生 只会循规蹈矩
You liberal goody-goodies can fret over the means.

1850
01:19:33,090 --> 01:19:34,500
- 你需要我  - 结果？
- You need me.  - The end?

1851
01:19:34,890 --> 01:19:36,050
你在国会翘着脚
It disappeared over the Hill

1852
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:38,170
公开侮辱国家国法的时候 就已经没有结果了
when you cocked your leg and pissed all over the flag!

1853
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:41,140
你居然把美国宪法比作占星术？
Comparing the United States Constitution to a horoscope?

1854
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:44,260
枪支管制的反对派肯定乐死了
That's the kind of shit the gun lobby thrives on.

1855
01:19:45,810 --> 01:19:47,310
你到底有没有意识到 我们输定了？
Or have you realized by now we're going to lose anyway?

1856
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,440
这比我的前途重要
This is more important than my career,

1857
01:19:49,530 --> 01:19:51,360
也比埃斯米每次面对记者
or Esme's unease at fighting reporters

1858
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,030
诉说那些经历的不安感重要
every time she has to take out the trash.

1859
01:19:53,070 --> 01:19:55,360
- 你简直疯了  - 我们不会输
- You're out of control.  - We're not gonna lose.

1860
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,280
如果我告诉你
What if I told you

1861
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:03,370
整个策略都是一个骗局呢？
this whole strategy was a shell game?

1862
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:08,200
只是演给公司里 其他像辛西娅·格林那样的人看的
For the benefit of the Cynthia Greens of this firm.

1863
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,130
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

1864
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:13,800
比尔·桑福德说的没错
Bill Sandford was right.

1865
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,840
女性才是枪支管制反对派的盲点
Women are the gun lobby's blind spot.

1866
01:20:19,810 --> 01:20:22,590
那是一股被他们忽视 而又不可控制的
A massive power base that they don't speak to

1867
01:20:23,230 --> 01:20:24,680
巨大的势力
and they can't control.

1868
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:26,550
然后呢？
And?

1869
01:20:28,270 --> 01:20:30,260
还记得我那些奇怪的短途旅行吗？
Those strange excursions on my itinerary?

1870
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:35,600
我都是去拜访女性代表 女权团体
Women's representative bodies, feminist groups,

1871
01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:37,780
还有女性总裁的
female CEOs.

1872
01:20:38,830 --> 01:20:40,320
我反复地游说她们
I've talked as many as I could

1873
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:42,120
甚至威胁她们 往我的个人账户
into brow-beating their membership

1874
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:43,490
捐钱
to donate to my PAC.

1875
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:44,570
你还有个人账户？
You have a PAC?

1876
01:20:46,370 --> 01:20:48,080
提交日期那天 比尔·桑福德
Bill Sandford's getting a nasty surprise

1877
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:49,580
会有个大惊喜
come filing day.

1878
01:20:50,290 --> 01:20:51,420
到底有多大？
How nasty are we talking?

1879
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,710
来自三百万个捐赠者 捐献的一千五百万
Fifteen million from over three million donors-nasty.

1880
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:57,580
三个月就这么多？
In one quarter?

1881
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:02,960
事实上 时间更短
Actually, less.

1882
01:21:04,810 --> 01:21:06,670
真不敢相信
Unbelievable.

1883
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:11,060
为什么现在告诉我？
Why are you telling me this now?

1884
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:13,690
你之前一直瞒着我
You kept this from me all along,

1885
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:14,900
为什么选择今晚告诉我？
and you're telling me tonight?

1886
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:16,810
天啊 我才告诉你 我们又有赢的希望了
Oh, my God, I tell you we're back in the game,

1887
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:18,110
你想说的就只有这个？
and all you can say is that?

1888
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:19,980
你一开始就打算把埃斯米供出去
You knew you were gonna screw Esme tonight,

1889
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:21,650
所以你才把这个消息瞒到现在
so you kept this from me to blindside me

1890
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:22,990
为了让我不开除你
before I had a chance to fire you.

1891
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:26,110
作为一个说客 你有着很不寻常的洞察力
You have unusual insight for a "boutique" lobbyist.

1892
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:28,620
从开始到现在 都是你一个人在操控着一切
You've been pulling all the strings, all along.

1893
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:31,710
游说的重点在于先见之明
Lobbying is about foresight.

1894
01:21:31,790 --> 01:21:34,050
你要预估你对手的行动 再制定应对的…
You anticipate your opponent's moves, you devise...

1895
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:36,960
我他妈不是你的对手！
I am not your fucking opponent!

1896
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:42,720
你有正常过吗？
Were you ever normal?

1897
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:45,630
小时候呢？
As a child?

1898
01:21:46,810 --> 01:21:49,270
或者说这种扭曲的思维 在你还没出生前
Or were the twisted thought processes in your mind

1899
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:50,480
就已经在你脑中滋生了？
hard-wired in the womb?

1900
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:52,560
因为我真的搞不明白
Because I'm having a really hard time

1901
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:55,350
为什么会有人有这样的思维
understanding how somebody gets to this.

1902
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,000
可能我就是个混蛋吧
Guess I'm just a piece of work.

1903
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,380
明天见
I'll see you tomorrow.

1904
01:22:41,030 --> 01:22:42,690
你是玛德琳·伊丽莎白·斯隆
You're Madeline Elizabeth Sloane.

1905
01:22:43,570 --> 01:22:45,910
你工作于处理政府事务的交流公司
You work in government affairs at a communications company.

1906
01:22:46,370 --> 01:22:47,700
谷歌技术真好
Well googled.

1907
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:50,860
那天是怎么回事？在凑资晚会上？
So what was that? At the fundraiser?

1908
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:53,250
你装作不认识我的样子
You pretended like we're strangers.

1909
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:54,920
不然你想我怎么反应？
What did you expect?

1910
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,000
你没事吧？
You all right?

1911
01:22:58,590 --> 01:22:59,580
嗯…
Mmm...

1912
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:04,300
唯一一个叫我玛德琳的人 就是我的母亲
The only person to call me Madeline was my mother.

1913
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,800
政府事务和沟通交流
Government affairs and communications

1914
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:10,720
都只是说客的褒义说法
are just fancy words for lobbying.

1915
01:23:11,390 --> 01:23:13,560
那说客又是什么的褒义说法？
And blowfish a fancy word for what, exactly?

1916
01:23:13,690 --> 01:23:15,270
离开这个房间 我们就是陌生人
Outside this room, we're strangers.

1917
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:17,980
这就是我们这种关系的规则
Those were the rules of this engagement.

1918
01:23:18,030 --> 01:23:19,110
当时没人…
We were alone...

1919
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:21,150
但那是公共场合
In a public place.

1920
01:23:21,650 --> 01:23:23,390
我不能在外面被人发现和你在一起
I can't be associated with you there.

1921
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:25,900
说不定有人知道你的真实身份
At least one other person knew who you were.

1922
01:23:26,910 --> 01:23:28,040
那个女的是谁？
Who was she, anyway?

1923
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:30,490
我不能泄露我的客户信息
I never reveal my clients. Ever.

1924
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:32,740
你只喜欢到处打听她们的个人生活
You just, uh, pry into their personal lives,

1925
01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:34,080
在谷歌上搜索真相
blowfish for the truth.

1926
01:23:34,330 --> 01:23:36,370
我听说你们这些政客对真相好像不感兴趣
Yeah, I hear you lobbyists ain't so good with the truth.

1927
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:37,750
你一个有着四重身份
Says the guy with four identities,

1928
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:39,240
靠和陌生人上床赚钱的人 也敢这么说？
who sleeps with strangers for money?

1929
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:41,540
我只是很惊讶 你怎么这么会说谎
I'm just surprised by what a natural bullshitter you are.

1930
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:43,500
你就是说谎长大的 福德
I grew up lying, Forde.

1931
01:23:43,590 --> 01:23:45,250
我也不想 但我不得不这么做
Didn't want to. I had to.

1932
01:23:45,890 --> 01:23:47,250
所以我才会这么擅长
That's why I excel at it.

1933
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:50,140
我也很愿意用这项技能
It's a skill I would've happily traded

1934
01:23:50,270 --> 01:23:51,260
交换一个正常的人生
for a normal life.

1935
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,060
正常也没那么好
Normal's overrated.

1936
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:38,470
对不起
I'm sorry.

1937
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,430
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1938
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:44,650
我做不到
But I can't.

1939
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:46,820
怎么了？
What's wrong?

1940
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:54,610
- 抱歉  - 今晚就算了
- I'm sorry.  - Forget about tonight.

1941
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:57,200
怎么了？我做错什么了吗？
Why? I do somethin'?

1942
01:24:57,380 --> 01:24:59,040
不是的…
No, it's, um...

1943
01:25:00,670 --> 01:25:02,500
我现在没这个心情
I'm not in the right frame of mind.

1944
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:05,500
给你
Here.

1945
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:08,840
- 这应该是你赚过最容易的钱了  - 可我什么都没做
- Easiest money you ever made.  - I didn't do anything.

1946
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:12,590
你如约出现了 而我浪费了你的时间
Well, you showed up, I wasted your time, so, yeah.

1947
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:14,880
我们就坐下来谈谈也行
You know, we could just sit and talk, and...

1948
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:16,470
拿好这该死的钱 福德！
Take the fucking money, Forde!

1949
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:24,190
请你离开
Get out, please.

1950
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:32,070
随便你吧
Suit yourself.

1951
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:49,760
诺伊马克
Neumark.

1952
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:51,750
- 米尔纳  - 来个人帮忙 快点
- Milner.  - Two hands here, come on.

1953
01:25:51,890 --> 01:25:53,920
- 科尔森…  - 韦德·鲍威尔 弗吉尼亚
- Carlson...  - Wade Powell, Virginia.

1954
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:55,050
还有哈克曼
Hackman's come over too.

1955
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:57,270
我们失去了米尔纳 诺伊马克 科尔森 还有哈克曼
We've lost Milner, Neumark, Carlson, Hackman.

1956
01:25:57,390 --> 01:25:59,220
阿达莫的主任说他的立场也开始动摇了
Adamou's chief of staff said he's softening his position.

1957
01:25:59,270 --> 01:26:00,930
- 艾利克斯？ - 我来给他的屁眼松松土…
- Alex?  - I'll soften his fuckin'...

1958
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:02,430
比尔·桑德福在三号线
Bill Sandford's on line 3.

1959
01:26:02,570 --> 01:26:03,980
马上让阿达莫关门
Closing Adamou right the fuck now.

1960
01:26:06,690 --> 01:26:07,680
她偷走了我的点子
She takes my own idea

1961
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:08,990
升级之后又用来对抗我们
and goes up against us with it.

1962
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:10,530
我们早就警告过你 比尔
We did try to warn you, Bill.

1963
01:26:10,950 --> 01:26:13,440
来自三百万个捐赠者的一千五百万
Fifteen million. From three million donors.

1964
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:14,740
在不到三个月的时间里
In less than a quarter.

1965
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:17,110
你要是能阻止她 就能阻止希顿·哈里斯
You stop her, you stop Heaton-Harris.

1966
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:18,580
你必须谨慎行事
We have to make it personal now.

1967
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:19,820
她现在可是关注的焦点
She becomes the story.

1968
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,120
我们可以动用媒体关系 比尔
We can use our media relationships, Bill,

1969
01:26:22,290 --> 01:26:23,410
让她处于劣势
put her on the defensive.

1970
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:25,160
我不仅仅想打压她
I don't just want her on the defensive.

1971
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:27,670
也不仅想从运动中把她除掉
I don't just want her off the campaign.

1972
01:26:27,970 --> 01:26:30,800
我想让她成为杀一儆百的例子 让其他人看看
I want her to be the reason that people think twice

1973
01:26:30,930 --> 01:26:33,460
和第二修正案作对 会有什么后果
before taking on the guardians of the Second Amendment.

1974
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:36,050
我要毁了她的前途
I want her career.

1975
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,430
艾利克斯 是我 我刚刚下飞机
Hey, Alex, it's me. I just landed.

1976
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:43,400
费城和我想象中一样 是个好地方
Philadelphia was as good as what we could have hoped for.

1977
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:45,690
- 现在情况如何？ - 还有四票就搞定了
- So how are we doing?  - That's four to go, people.

1978
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,820
不是开玩笑的吧
You're kidding me.

1979
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:52,690
哇 真是太棒了
Wow, that's amazing.

1980
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:53,820
好了
All right.

1981
01:26:53,870 --> 01:26:55,320
我们请来了埃斯米·曼尼克瑞安
We're joined now by Esme Manucharian.

1982
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:57,080
埃斯米 谢谢你加入我们
Esme, thanks for joining us.

1983
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:58,950
你觉得之前针对枪支的辩论
Would you say that the gun debate is now

1984
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:00,320
已经上升到女权的问题了吗？
largely become a women's issue?

1985
01:27:00,370 --> 01:27:01,990
你只需要看看数据
You need only look at the numbers

1986
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:03,740
就能发现枪支安全问题
to see that gun safety has become

1987
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,420
已经变成美国女性所面临的首要问题
a deciding issue for American women.

1988
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:08,000
如果众议员不理会问题的真实存在
If their representative isn't listening,

1989
01:27:08,170 --> 01:27:10,160
我们就会通过民意投票 选出能为我们做主的代表
they'll go to the polls and elect someone who will.

1990
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:22,100
你想干什么？
What do you want?

1991
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:24,060
我有整整一千五百万可以挥霍
I got 15 million to blow.

1992
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,140
劳伦在筛选你的信件
Lauren was going through your letters.

1993
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:30,140
在满满一信箱的死亡威胁信和僧恨信中 她找到了这封
Between the death threats and the hate mail, she found this.

1994
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:33,110
《前哨报》的布鲁·沃尔什
Pru Walsh of The Sentinel is doing

1995
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:34,450
正在做游说业的专题报道
a feature on the lobbying industry.

1996
01:27:34,490 --> 01:27:35,530
她想找你
That means you.

1997
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:37,900
如果她真想见我 何必写信给我？
Well, if she wants to meet me, why did she send a letter?

1998
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:39,660
因为她不是真的想见你
Because she doesn't really want to meet you.

1999
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:40,950
她说她想联系你 安排一次采访
She wants to say she reached out to you

2000
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,490
但是并没收到回信
for an interview, but didn't hear back.

2001
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:43,990
这是对别人的侮辱
It's a takedown.

2002
01:27:44,130 --> 01:27:45,830
至少我们还能让她失望
Well, the least we can do is disappoint her.

2003
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:48,330
去安排吧
Set it up.

2004
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:50,790
我取消了你十点的安排
I've canceled your 10:00 a.m.

2005
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,370
去跟我们的内部律师见个面
You're gonna see our in-house attorney.

2006
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:54,460
真不敢相信你们居然见过面
I don't believe you two have met.

2007
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:57,590
你知道我对这件事的态度
You know how I feel about this.

2008
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:59,010
我一开始就反对你招她进来
I was against you ever hiring her.

2009
01:27:59,390 --> 01:28:01,550
因为你的工作 不是赢得游说战
Because your job is not winning lobbying fights,

2010
01:28:01,890 --> 01:28:03,600
而是防止让我们变得…
your job is to stop us from getting...

2011
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:08,940
对她这么卑鄙的行为 你居然睁一只眼闭一只眼
Quite independently of her being utterly contemptible.

2012
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,770
你到底在想什么？
What the hell were you thinking?

2013
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:12,230
不管原因是什么
You know, whatever it was,

2014
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:15,030
现在看起来都很愚蠢
I guess it seems pretty stupid now.

2015
01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:17,150
莉斯 来见见你的律师

也是一个业余唇语爱好者
And amateur lip-reader.

2019
01:28:35,130 --> 01:28:37,090
建一面玻璃墙 这到底是谁的主意？
Whose idea were the glass walls? Seriously?

2020
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,550
明天还要上两个电视节目
Two TV slots tomorrow,

2021
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:44,060
一个广播台节目 之后就可以离开伊利诺斯了
then a radio thing, and finally I'm done in Illinois.

2022
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:45,850
你现在在哪儿？
Where are you?

2023
01:28:45,940 --> 01:28:47,300

Gold Stone, waiting for them to hurry up

2024
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,390
他们速度太慢了
and invent the food pill.

2025
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:50,480
那可能得等一会
That may take a while.

2026
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:53,310
然后一边在计划如何让最后的四个议员支持我们
And plotting to ensnare our last four senators.

2027
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:56,060
现在已经拿下五十六人 还剩四人 我们的表现已经非常… 噢！
Fifty-six down, four to go. We're actually doing... Oh!

2028
01:28:56,610 --> 01:28:58,820
- 对不起  - 抱歉 对不起
- I'm sorry.  - I'm so sorry. My fault.

2029
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:04,240
- 谢谢你  - 给你
- Thanks. Thank you.  - Here you go.

2030
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:06,030
好的
Okay.

2031
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:09,700
不好意思
Sorry about that.

2032
01:29:09,790 --> 01:29:11,910
还记得第一天的时候 我问你我们该如何取胜时
Remember that first day when I asked how do we win,

2033
01:29:12,050 --> 01:29:13,750
你回答我“事实上 我们赢不了”吗？
and you said "Realistically, we don't"?

2034
01:29:14,630 --> 01:29:16,420
每一个字我都记得清清楚楚
I stand by every word of that.

2035
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:17,790
不好意思？
Excuse me?

2036
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:19,880
所以那一千五百万 你想就这么轻描淡写一笔带过？
So you're going to downplay the 15 million?

2037
01:29:19,930 --> 01:29:21,040
是啊 我们要保持低调
Yeah, 'cause we can't sound like

2038
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:23,260
不能让别人以为我们太自以为是了
we're bragging about how much we're pulling in.

2039
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:27,140
议员会根据捐款情况 决定自己的投票意图
Senators link donations to voting intention,

2040
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:28,850
在这之前 我们不能说错话…
we can't say anything that might stop...

2041
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:30,300
你想尝尝子弹吗 婊子？
You wanna take this, bitch?

2042
01:29:31,940 --> 01:29:32,930
嗯？
Huh?

2043
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:35,690
埃斯米 你在听吗？
Esme, you're still there?

2044
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:37,030
来啊
Come on.

2045
01:29:38,910 --> 01:29:40,070
尝尝啊
Take it.

2046
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:45,450
埃斯米？发生什么事了？
Esme? What the hell was that?

2047
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:47,240
你经历过这种情况 对吧？
You been here before, right?

2048
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:49,070
埃斯米？
Esme?

2049
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:50,700
看着我！
Look at me!

2050
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:52,580
埃斯米？
Esme?

2051
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:54,620
但这次我要你的命
Except I'm gonna do it right this time.

2052
01:30:16,690 --> 01:30:17,930
我现在所站的位置
I'm standing at the scene

2053
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:19,190
就是昨晚发生枪击案的现场
of last night's shooting.

2054
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:20,780
我们了解到 袭击者的目标
We understand that the assailant

2055
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,950
是枪支管制运动中的领导人物
was targeting a leading figure in the gun control movement,

2056
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:26,320
但最后袭击者被一名手持
and was then shot dead by a civilian

2057
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:28,990
实名登记过的手枪的市民击毙
carrying a registered, concealed firearm.

2058
01:30:29,670 --> 01:30:32,370
这位好心人的名字叫作…
The name of the vigilante has yet to be revealed...

2059
01:30:33,670 --> 01:30:35,880
乔治？
George?

2060
01:30:36,210 --> 01:30:37,500
你在看新闻吗？
You're watching the news?

2061
01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:39,670
比尔·桑福德的好日子
Yeah, whole bunch of Christmases

2062
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:41,210
提前来了
just came early for Bill Sandford.

2063
01:30:42,050 --> 01:30:45,140
我正在往机场赶 准备出去好好潇洒一下
I'm headed to the airport. Get ready to spend some money.

2064
01:30:46,350 --> 01:30:48,340
警察确认了该位市民的身份 他叫弗兰克·麦吉尔
Police have confirmed his identity as Frank McGill.

2065
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:52,510
麦吉尔的手枪是登记过的 是合法的
McGill was a legal owner of a registered weapon.

2066
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:54,850
希顿·哈里斯对他构不成影响
Heaton-Harris wouldn't have touched him.

2067
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:56,890
但对另一个混蛋
But it might have made it harder

2068
01:30:57,030 --> 01:30:58,360
就没那么容易了
for the other son of a bitch.

2069
01:30:58,490 --> 01:31:01,400
我们对这个人有什么了解？他是从哪里买来的枪？
What do we know about him? Where'd he get his piece?

2070
01:31:01,570 --> 01:31:03,560
他的地下室是不是私藏了很多武器…
Did he have an arsenal stashed in his basement...

2071
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:05,860
由于第二修正案的存在
For the Second Amendment,

2072
01:31:05,990 --> 01:31:08,200
才使她在面对精神有问题的人时
which guaranteed her right to be protected

2073
01:31:08,330 --> 01:31:09,660
能够受到保护
from a sick individual.

2074
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:11,990
最重要的是 给像弗兰克·麦吉尔
And most of all, for Frank McGill.

2075
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:15,290
这样有警戒心 负责任 且枪法准的模范市民
Model citizen, vigilant, responsible,

2076
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:16,910
提供了救人的机会
and his aim is true.

2077
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:47,910
你还好吗？
How are you doing?

2078
01:31:58,050 --> 01:31:59,250
你要回家吗？
You heading home?

2079
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:03,790
你订了华盛顿来的往返机票
You make a round-trip from D.C.

2080
01:32:03,930 --> 01:32:05,260
就是想来候机室盯住我？
to pin me in a departure lounge?

2081
01:32:06,930 --> 01:32:08,640
好确定我有按照你的剧本走？
So you can check me off your list?

2082
01:32:12,270 --> 01:32:14,550
我背叛了你的信任 我想陪你回去
I betrayed your confidence. I set you down this path.

2083
01:32:16,110 --> 01:32:17,690
“没关系 莉斯 这不是你的错”
"Don't worry, Liz, it's not your fault."

2084
01:32:17,770 --> 01:32:19,110
这就是你想听到的回答吗？
ls that what you wanna hear?

2085
01:32:20,230 --> 01:32:21,850
“你怎么可能预先想到？”
"How could you possibly have known?"

2086
01:32:23,650 --> 01:32:24,990
我是不会这么说的
You're not gonna get it.

2087
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:28,280
他想杀了我
He wanted to kill me.

2088
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:38,830
我不知道界限在哪 埃斯米
I didn't know where the line was, Esme.

2089
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:47,920
我从来都不知道界限在什么地方
I never, never know where the line is.

2090
01:32:57,310 --> 01:32:58,810
你想休息多久都行
Obviously, take all the time you want.

2091
01:32:59,150 --> 01:33:00,180
等你准备好了
And when you're ready,

2092
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:01,980
我们很欢迎你 重新加入
we'd love to have you back on the campaign.

2093
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:04,110
这次由你自己选择
Your own terms.

2094
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:05,780
不用面对媒体 你做幕后工作也行
No media, you can work behind the scenes.

2095
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:10,660
如果你不想和我共事
If you don't want to work with me,

2096
01:33:12,660 --> 01:33:14,070
我就辞职
I'll resign from the campaign.

2097
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:17,990
如果这是你所希望的
If that's what you want.

2098
01:33:18,710 --> 01:33:20,830
这就是你求我回去工作的办法？
Is that your move to get me back at my desk?

2099
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:23,750
你想让我面对摄像头
You want me in front of a camera

2100
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,130
和弗兰克·麦吉尔对峙？
to counter Frank McGill?

2101
01:33:30,850 --> 01:33:34,340
我甚至想过 这一切都是你策划的
It even crossed my mind that this was all you.

2102
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:37,220
你只是没想到
You just didn't account

2103
01:33:37,350 --> 01:33:38,850
在我身后真的出现了一个持枪的人
for an armed civilian right behind me.

2104
01:33:40,190 --> 01:33:41,180
埃斯米…
Esme...

2105
01:33:41,230 --> 01:33:42,730
我会继续战斗的 伊丽莎白
I'll keep fighting, Elizabeth.

2106
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:45,360
只要是我能出力的地方都行
Wherever I can make a difference.

2107
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:50,230
但前提是 离你远远的
But as far as possible away from you.

2108
01:33:54,370 --> 01:33:56,080
当你停止以尊重待人的时候
You crossed the line when you stopped

2109
01:33:56,210 --> 01:33:57,370
你就已经越界了
treating people with respect.

2110
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,160
你足够聪明 一定早就意识到这一点了
You're smart enough to know that.

2111
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:02,990
你只是不在乎罢了
You just don't care.

2112
01:34:08,890 --> 01:34:10,880
谢谢 谢谢大家 欢迎回来
Thank you, thank you. Welcome back.

2113
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:12,380
我们的下一位嘉宾
Our next guest this morning is

2114
01:34:12,510 --> 01:34:13,670
是那种在你下班回家路上
the kind of guy you'd want to have around

2115
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:15,550
突然遇见一个人 拿枪指着你的脸
when you're walking home from work one night

2116
01:34:15,770 --> 01:34:17,680
你一定希望他出现在你身边的人
and some dude sticks a gun in your face.

2117
01:34:17,770 --> 01:34:19,010
在结束了军旅生涯之后
After his military career,

2118
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:20,600
麦吉尔做了一名商业飞行员…
McGill worked as a commercial pilot...

2119
01:34:20,730 --> 01:34:22,560
各位 面对现实吧 现在大街上已经不安全了
Let's face it, folks, the streets ain't safe.

2120
01:34:22,610 --> 01:34:24,310
要不是我们接下来这位勇敢 无畏
And if it wasn't for the courage, bravery,

2121
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,480
且枪法准的嘉宾
and damn fine aim of our next guest,

2122
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:30,450
就会有另一场悲剧发生
we'd be reflecting on yet another tragedy.

2123
01:34:30,450 --> 01:34:32,230
女士们先生们 掌声欢迎
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome

2124
01:34:32,370 --> 01:34:34,950
最近的大红人 弗兰克·麦吉尔
the man of the moment, Frank McGill.

2125
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:41,660
弗兰克·麦吉尔 你真是全美英雄
So, Frank McGill, all-American hero.

2126
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,500
算不上 我只是一个在
Not at all. An ordinary guy

2127
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:45,090
合适的时间 合适的地点 出现了的普通人
in the right place at the right time.

2128
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:47,120
在他的皮带下面 放了一颗子弹
TALK SHOW HOST 1 With a 9 milli. under his belt.

2129
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:51,340
我很好奇 你之前救的那个人曾领导过
I'm curious. The person whose life you saved once campaigned

2130
01:34:51,430 --> 01:34:53,670
废除携带枪支条令的活动
for a ban on concealed carry.

2131
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:55,250
你对此作何感想？
How do you feel about that?

2132
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:57,430
我很反对这样的观点
I respectfully disagree with those views.

2133
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,300
但那位小姐有权利坚持自己的主观
But the young lady is entitled to her opinion

2134
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:01,350
没有人可以因为这一点 而去攻击她
and nobody should be attacking her for that,

2135
01:35:01,810 --> 01:35:03,140
更别说拿枪去威胁她
much less holding her at gunpoint.

2136
01:35:04,110 --> 01:35:05,770
麦吉尔是上帝的礼物
McGill's a gift from God.

2137
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:08,940
但效应并不会长久
But it won't last forever.

2138
01:35:09,950 --> 01:35:11,480
我们在计划来发大的
We're looking to parlay that

2139
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:13,270
更进一步地考验这个斯隆
into a closer examination of Sloane.

2140
01:35:13,530 --> 01:35:15,440
我在考虑办一场国会听证会
I'm thinking of a Congressional hearing

2141
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:19,070
来会会她另类的游说技巧
into her unorthodox lobbying practices.

2142
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:23,950
我肯定能找到一个愿意接受这个方案的议员
I'm sure we can find a senator who may be open to the idea.

2143
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:26,040
你想在媒体面前泼她脏水
You want to talk trash about her in the press,

2144
01:35:26,090 --> 01:35:27,080
这是一回事
that's one thing.

2145
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:28,870
但国会听证会需要
A Congressional hearing requires

2146
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:31,580
我们有确实的 关于她不正当行为的证据
a convincing allegation of impropriety.

2147
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:34,170
如果能让她脸面全无 我举双手赞成
I'd give my left nut to drag her rep through the dirt,

2148
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:35,590
但这是不可能的事
but you're not gonna get it.

2149
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,600
她是开脱罪责的专家
She's a CYA specialist.

2150
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:40,980
我从没见过像她那样擅于卖弄学问的人…
I've never met anyone so pedantic...

2151
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:42,470
快开始全面调查
Start an inquisition.

2152
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:46,560
让我们看看 她究竟有多会隐藏自己的污点
Let's see how well-covered her ass really is.

2153
01:35:49,570 --> 01:35:50,650
嗨
Hi.

2154
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:54,030
我是布鲁·沃尔什 谢谢你们能来
Pru Walsh. Thanks so much for coming over.

2155
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:56,070
这位是来自法律部的麦克·戈登
This is Mike Gordon from our legal department.

2156
01:35:56,530 --> 01:35:57,690
这位是我们法律部的丹尼尔·波斯纳
Daniel Posner from ours.

2157
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:00,120
斯隆女士 你是这个行业里
Miss Sloane, you're at the forefront

2158
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:02,370
最具关注度的人物 但你的名声却很臭
of an industry with a terrible reputation.

2159
01:36:02,670 --> 01:36:03,830
你有想过为什么吗？
Do you think that's deserved?

2160
01:36:05,790 --> 01:36:07,330
这项法案在过去几年 没被推翻的唯一原因
The only reason this bill wasn't passed decades ago

2161
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:09,120
就是它能够满足某些权势的特殊利益
is because of the power of special interests.

2162
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:10,670
当一个说客在凑集资金时…
When a lobbyist raises finance...

2163
01:36:11,220 --> 01:36:12,500
在袭击案发生后 都没有看到
We haven't heard from Esme Manucharian

2164
01:36:12,550 --> 01:36:14,880
埃斯米·曼尼克瑞安 你有和她联系过吗？
since the attack. Are you in contact with her?

2165
01:36:16,050 --> 01:36:17,420
这是我的私事
That's a private matter.

2166
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:19,140
我觉得非常重要的一点…
I think what's important to remember...

2167
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:20,630
那你有跟她沟通过吗？
So have you talked to her at all?

2168
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:23,350
值得注意的一点就是 这个弗兰克·麦吉尔
What is important to remember here is that Frank McGill

2169
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:25,260
恰巧就是守法 并且负有责任的
is exactly the kind of law-abiding,

2170
01:36:25,690 --> 01:36:27,060
枪支拥有者
responsible gun owner

2171
01:36:27,190 --> 01:36:29,180
而这种人的权利 是受到希顿·哈里斯的保护的
whose rights the Heaton-Harris Bill protects.

2172
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:30,930
你对发生的一切内疚吗？
Do you feel any guilt about what happened?

2173
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:32,480
我为什么要感觉内疚？
Why would I feel guilt?

2174
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:34,900
你让埃斯米当你们运动的门面
You made Esme the face of your campaign.

2175
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:36,560
是你在那次辩论赛上
You thrust her into the limelight

2176
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:37,780
把她推向风口浪尖的
that night on the debate.

2177
01:36:37,870 --> 01:36:39,530
- 我不想谈这件事  - 你也不需要回答
- I'm not talking about this.  - You don't have to.

2178
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:40,570
对于你要让她在国家电视台露面一事
Did she know that you were going to

2179
01:36:40,580 --> 01:36:42,530
她知情吗？她有同意吗？
out her on national TV? Did she agree to that?

2180
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:45,210
你为什么不报道一下 多数的枪支拥有者
Why not report that the majority of gun owners

2181
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:47,080
更支持全面的背景调查呢？
favor more extensive background checks?

2182
01:36:47,210 --> 01:36:48,540
她可能整个职业生涯
She probably went her entire career

2183
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:49,700
都在小心地守护自己这个秘密
trying to keep that a carefully guarded secret.

2184
01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:50,910
反对枪支管制的人只会用花言巧语
That the gun lobby's fear-mongering rhetoric

2185
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:53,220
传播一些谣言 抹黑希顿·哈里斯法案
is trying to paint Heaton-Harris into something it's not.

2186
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:55,250
你觉得是不是因为你把她的秘密揭露了
Do you think that your little revelation

2187
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:57,260
才致使她成为被袭击目标的？
is what made her a target?

2188
01:36:57,390 --> 01:36:58,420
很明显 斯隆女士
It's clear Miss Sloane

2189
01:36:58,550 --> 01:36:59,670
现在不想谈关于曼尼克瑞安小姐的事
doesn't wish to discuss Ms. Manucharian.

2190
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:00,800
更明显的是 你的文章
What's really clear is that

2191
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:02,050
早就已经写好了
your article's already written.

2192
01:37:02,270 --> 01:37:03,350
别回答这个问题
Don't respond to that.

2193
01:37:03,390 --> 01:37:04,930
你的这些言论纯属肆意推测
That's purely speculative on your part.

2194
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:06,930
- 你的领导是谁？ - 别这样
- Who's controlling you?  - Let's not do this.

2195
01:37:07,060 --> 01:37:08,800
事实就是 你根本不会知道
Look, the fact is, you have no way of knowing

2196
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:10,100
沃尔什女士的意图…
what Ms. Walsh intends to do...

2197
01:37:10,230 --> 01:37:11,520
真正的事实是 你们对斯隆女士
The fact is that you have no interest

2198
01:37:11,570 --> 01:37:12,820
将要讲的话根本就没有兴趣
in what Miss Sloane has to say.

2199
01:37:13,190 --> 01:37:15,360
- 你怎么知道？ - 你的录音机已经关了
- And how would you know that?  - Your Dictaphone's off.

2200
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:22,070
太丢脸了
Takedown.

2201
01:37:22,450 --> 01:37:23,780
这还算好的了
It could've been worse.

2202
01:37:23,910 --> 01:37:26,000
我现在已经发现四处事实错误了
I've got four factual errors so far.

2203
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:27,780
这对你影响不好 莉斯
This is not good, Liz.

2204
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:29,370
都扔进碎纸机里去吧
Dump it in the recycling.

2205
01:37:29,460 --> 01:37:30,670
还能多造几支铅笔出来
They'll make pencils out of it.

2206
01:37:31,250 --> 01:37:32,460
说不定其中一支就能
Maybe one will find its way into

2207
01:37:32,510 --> 01:37:34,250
跑到一个真正有职业道德的记者手上
the hands of a reporter with some integrity.

2208
01:37:34,590 --> 01:37:35,720
这些负面影响一会儿就过去了
It will go away.

2209
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:39,470
好的 谢谢你
Okay, thank you.

2210
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:42,090
再见
Bye.

2211
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:47,470
这些议员一下子都忙起来了 也真是搞笑
Funny how all these senators are suddenly very busy.

2212
01:37:49,810 --> 01:37:51,430
真正的原因我们心知肚明
We all know why that is.

2213
01:37:55,570 --> 01:37:57,060
好吧 现在的形式很严峻
Okay, so it's not great.

2214
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:00,070
那一千五百万能帮我们走到现在
The 15 million helped us get this far,

2215
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:01,900
但却不足以帮助我们
but it doesn't last long when you're fighting

2216
01:38:01,990 --> 01:38:03,200
和国会最富有的团体相抗衡
the richest group on the Hill.

2217
01:38:03,490 --> 01:38:04,570
直接说正事吧
Let's get to the point.

2218
01:38:04,660 --> 01:38:06,120
到最后投票的时候 我们究竟能拿几票？
How does it shake out when it comes to the vote?

2219
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:09,000
我们之前跟他们相差不多 但根据最近的情况推断
We'd run them close. But by latest projections,

2220
01:38:09,630 --> 01:38:11,790
到最后我们应该会少四到七票
we'll be between four to seven votes short.

2221
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:14,870
今晚也没什么可做的了
There's nothing more we can do tonight.

2222
01:38:16,170 --> 01:38:17,380
莉斯 不必赶我们走
Liz, we don't have to leave.

2223
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:19,130
西海岸现在还是白天
The West Coast is still awake.

2224
01:38:19,470 --> 01:38:20,580
我们可以和俄勒冈州联系
We can connect with Oregon.

2225
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:21,970
如果我们能取得那些伐木工的支持
If we close those goddamn loggers,

2226
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:23,470
今晚就能赢得五张选票
we could get it to five votes tonight.

2227
01:38:23,510 --> 01:38:25,510
回家休息一下吧 各位
Go home and get some rest, guys.

2228
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:26,800
你们已经忙了一天了
You've done enough for today.

2229
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:29,140
我等会去街上 把那些该死的印有
I'll take to the streets and rip down those

2230
01:38:29,150 --> 01:38:31,730
弗兰克·麦吉尔的海报都撕了
fucking Frank McGill posters one at a time if I have to.

2231
01:38:32,150 --> 01:38:33,980
回家吧 养精蓄锐
Go home, sharpen your knives.

2232
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:35,730
明天还要苦战呢
It'll still be on tomorrow.

2233
01:39:09,230 --> 01:39:10,640
我们继续努力
So we keep on fighting.

2234
01:39:11,350 --> 01:39:12,840
不然还能怎么办
That's all we can do.

2235
01:39:13,690 --> 01:39:15,150
我的前妻也经常这么说
As my ex-wife used to say.

2236
01:39:20,070 --> 01:39:21,480
你以前是干资金凑集的
I met you running from a fundraiser.

2237
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:24,440
并不需要干这种事
You could be done with all this.

2238
01:39:25,910 --> 01:39:27,200
你为什么不选择退出？
Why don't you quit?

2239
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:33,160
退出之后干嘛？
And do what?

2240
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:49,510
晚安
Good night.

2241
01:40:25,090 --> 01:40:26,250
喂？
Hello?

2242
01:40:27,930 --> 01:40:29,340
真惊讶 你居然接了
I'm surprised you picked up.

2243
01:40:31,930 --> 01:40:33,470
抱歉 你打错了
I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.

2244
01:41:50,180 --> 01:41:52,760
她经常占国会议员的便宜
She'd ply Congressmen with benefits,

2245
01:41:53,390 --> 01:41:56,630
免费的午餐 晚会门票 以及高尔夫周末
free meals, tickets to events, golfing weekends.

2246
01:41:56,770 --> 01:41:59,180
全都是由我们的客户付的钱
All paid for by our clients, via the firm.

2247
01:41:59,270 --> 01:42:00,730
这条线索足够了吧
Well, that right there's enough.

2248
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:02,560
她一定会要求我们出示收据的
She'd make a point of invoicing them,

2249
01:42:02,730 --> 01:42:04,470
但没人以为自己会付钱
though they were never expected to pay.

2250
01:42:05,030 --> 01:42:06,900
债务部分在我们的资产负债表上并没有明确表示
The debt shows as an asset on our balance sheet.

2251
01:42:06,900 --> 01:42:08,770
这样我们才能适时对它进行修改
We can call it in any time we want.

2252
01:42:08,870 --> 01:42:10,900
你当她助手当了两年
You were her right hand for two years.

2253
01:42:12,870 --> 01:42:15,030
一定有什么我们遗漏了的
There's got to be something.

2254
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:18,950
她的档案上为什么没出现任何名字？
Why's nobody on her files?

2255
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:21,370
有很多我们的人 但其余的都被删除了
There were a ton of us, but the others got pulled out.

2256
01:42:21,380 --> 01:42:23,120
看样子我们很难有所发现了
It's not like we're in danger of finding anything.

2257
01:42:23,170 --> 01:42:24,330
你现在有什么进展？
Well, how far d'you get?

2258
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:25,960
我查找了她跳槽之前
We worked backwards from her last deal

2259
01:42:26,090 --> 01:42:27,210
接的最后一笔单子
before she jumped ship.

2260
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:28,510
他们说最好能从最近的事上
They said it'd be better if we can

2261
01:42:28,550 --> 01:42:29,710
找出些端倪
nail her on something recent.

2262
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,920
- 比如？ - “西玛洛蛋糕”
- Which was?  - Shmallow Cakes.

2263
01:42:32,060 --> 01:42:33,090
跟税金有关
Some tax thing.

2264
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:35,090
她进行到一半就终止了
She left halfway through.

2265
01:42:35,180 --> 01:42:36,760
我怎么记得是叫什么棕榈油
I thought it was the palm oil thing.

2266
01:42:36,930 --> 01:42:37,920
棕榈油？
Palm oil?

2267
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:39,260
能多益税金
Nutella Tax.

2268
01:42:40,690 --> 01:42:41,800
等一下
Hold on.

2269
01:42:43,110 --> 01:42:44,810
印尼？
The Indonesians?

2270
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:46,390
我怎么不记得了
I don't remember seeing that.

2271
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:55,360
你在找什么？
What are you looking for?

2272
01:42:59,210 --> 01:43:00,410
杜邦先生
Mr. Dupont,

2273
01:43:01,130 --> 01:43:02,740
她违反了参议院道德准则
she's in breach of Senate Ethics rules.

2274
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:04,540
我们有证据
We can prove it.

2275
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:27,100
这段时间你的状态不是很好啊 罗恩
Things not looking so good for you this cycle, Ron.

2276
01:43:29,490 --> 01:43:32,400
你要问我的话 我觉得你需要多看看付费电视
You ask me, you're gonna need a lot more paid media.

2277
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:34,030
我没问你
I didn't ask you.

2278
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:38,940
快想想谁能帮你搞定那些电视节目？
Now, who might just be able to fund those coveted TV spots?

2279
01:43:39,330 --> 01:43:41,040
我是支持希顿·哈里斯的
I'm committed to Heaton-Harris,

2280
01:43:41,290 --> 01:43:43,000
我不能说一套
I can't vote for it with one hand

2281
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:44,870
背后做一套
and choke it with the other.

2282
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:46,950
你当然可以 只需要打着公正的幌子
Under cover of impartiality, sure you can.

2283
01:43:47,510 --> 01:43:50,500
你曾经可是名噪一时的说客
You've been a vocal critic of lobbyists in the past.

2284
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:53,550
你要发起一项针对斯隆的调查
You'll lead an inquiry into Sloane's affairs

2285
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:55,880
借以回应近来越来越被媒体关注的
in response to growing media pressure

2286
01:43:56,140 --> 01:43:58,300
她所犯下的罪行
regarding her litany of misdeeds.

2287
01:43:58,930 --> 01:44:03,300
举办听证会的钱 可都来自老百姓的钱包
The cost of hearings is paid from the public purse.

2288
01:44:04,060 --> 01:44:06,350
罗恩 我们的客户专门选定你
Ron, our clients have identified you

2289
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:08,560
作为组织这场听证会的主持
as the man to pull this off.

2290
01:44:08,740 --> 01:44:09,720
如果你拒绝
If you decline,

2291
01:44:09,820 --> 01:44:11,280
我可阻止不了他们
I can't stop them from

2292
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:13,690
对你实施经济制裁
blitzing you with negative finance.

2293
01:44:14,490 --> 01:44:17,610
除非把你榨干 不然他们是不会善罢甘休的
They won't stop until they annihilate you.

2294
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:21,570
你知道“毁灭”的这个词的词根源于哪里吗？
You know the root of the word "annihilate"?

2295
01:44:22,670 --> 01:44:23,780
拉丁文
It's Latin.

2296
01:44:25,330 --> 01:44:27,460
是“不惜一切代价消灭”的意思
It means, "reduce to nothing."

2297
01:44:29,260 --> 01:44:31,460
他们就会这样对你 罗恩
That's what they're going to do to you, Ron.

2298
01:44:31,550 --> 01:44:34,630
所以你要我怎么做？拿比尔·桑福德提供的好处
So, what? I'll be taking a wedge from Bill Sandford

2299
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:36,850
然后对希顿·哈里斯
and leading the attack

2300
01:44:36,850 --> 01:44:39,050
最具关注度的倡导者 实施全面调查？
on Heaton-Harris' most visible advocate?

2301
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:41,260
一个六年级的小学生 就会划线将点连起来
A 6th grader could connect the dots.

2302
01:44:41,350 --> 01:44:44,890
我们可以对现有的资源进行混淆
We can create a structure to obfuscate the source.

2303
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:46,930
你将得到的好处
Your big wedge will arrive

2304
01:44:47,020 --> 01:44:50,060
将会被分成八到十二个小块 送到你手中
courtesy of eight to 12 smaller entities

2305
01:44:50,150 --> 01:44:52,110
跟枪支都毫无关系
with no affiliation to guns.

2306
01:44:55,620 --> 01:44:56,980
你说的好处究竟有多劲爆？
How big a wedge we talking?

2307
01:44:59,870 --> 01:45:01,230
劲爆到
Big enough

2308
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:03,570
你可以选择
to be the difference between

2309
01:45:03,660 --> 01:45:05,370
继续坐在美国参议员的位置上
the continuation of your duties

2310
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:07,120
或者选择
as a United States Senator

2311
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:10,330
让你的职业生涯毁于一旦
and the reduction of your career to nothing.

2312
01:45:26,270 --> 01:45:27,480
这是自从两周前
This is every hit since

2313
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:29,900
布鲁·沃尔什报道后 所发表的所有讽刺文章
the original Pru Walsh hack-job two weeks ago.

2314
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:32,270
我个人最喜欢的是
My personal favorite is the one

2315
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:33,400
你如何通过造谣
about how you toppled

2316
01:45:33,530 --> 01:45:34,890
你们的学生会主席作弊
the head of the High School Student Council

2317
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:36,820
将其推翻
with a fabricated plagiarism scandal.

2318
01:45:37,620 --> 01:45:39,280
我觉得这并非诽谤
I'm assuming that's not libelous

2319
01:45:39,370 --> 01:45:40,780
因为你干得出来这种事
'cause I can totally see it.

2320
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:42,700
那个婊子很讨人厌的
That witch was insufferable.

2321
01:45:43,750 --> 01:45:45,360
我要把你从团队中开除
I'm taking you off the campaign.

2322
01:45:45,580 --> 01:45:46,570
什么？
What?

2323
01:45:47,670 --> 01:45:49,030
不是你 是她
Not you, her.

2324
01:45:50,210 --> 01:45:51,200
我先出去了
I'll be outside.

2325
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:54,170
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

2326
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:55,460
只要有你在
Heaton-Harris gets colder

2327
01:45:55,550 --> 01:45:56,960
希顿·哈里斯就日渐衰退
every day you're associated with it.

2328
01:45:57,970 --> 01:45:59,180
你和斯珀林有奸情
Sperling's got the hots for you.

2329
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:01,470
我连见都没见过他 这是陷害
I haven't even met him, this is a setup.

2330
01:46:02,010 --> 01:46:03,300
这是他们精心策划的
If they're orchestrating it,

2331
01:46:03,390 --> 01:46:05,050
目的就是想让我被开除
it's because they want me off the campaign.

2332
01:46:07,270 --> 01:46:09,010
现在 你有一场听证会要应付
Right now, you're lawyering up for a hearing.

2333
01:46:13,740 --> 01:46:15,100
根据印度尼西亚政府
Regarding your representation

2334
01:46:15,150 --> 01:46:16,360
的陈诉
of the Indonesian government.

2335
01:46:16,450 --> 01:46:17,690
丹 你忙吗？
Dan, are you busy?

2336
01:46:17,780 --> 01:46:18,990
艾伦·雅各布议员
Senator Allen Jacobs,

2337
01:46:19,370 --> 01:46:22,610
是被你称为“能多益税金”的资助人
the sponsor of the bill you dubbed the Nutella Tax,

2338
01:46:24,910 --> 01:46:26,990
他和家人乘坐头等舱 前往印尼
was flown to Indonesia first-class with his family,

2339
01:46:27,210 --> 01:46:29,410
住的是五星级宾馆
and put up at a 5-star hotel.

2340
01:46:30,170 --> 01:46:34,080
我们的审计员预估本次旅途 共花费三万美元
Our audit puts the cost of this trip at over $30,000.

2341
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:36,130
他回来之后
Shortly after his return,

2342
01:46:36,220 --> 01:46:38,880
很快他的提案就被搁置了
the bill was pulled from consideration.

2343
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:42,800
这是怎么回事？
Now, why do you suppose this happened?

2344
01:46:42,890 --> 01:46:45,680
据我了解 那次旅途是带有教育目的的
I understand the trip was for educational purposes.

2345
01:46:45,770 --> 01:46:48,350
我猜测他意识到自己的提案
I can surmise that he learned how his bill

2346
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:49,930
很可能会抑制当地基础工业的发展
would have strangled a key industry,

2347
01:46:50,020 --> 01:46:51,560
还会使数千位
and confined thousands

2348
01:46:51,650 --> 01:46:54,260
农民遭受穷苦
of impoverished farmers to destitution.

2349
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:56,060
他是躺在自己的私人海滩上意识到的？
From his private beach?

2350
01:46:57,150 --> 01:47:00,440
真相是 你的客户资助这次旅行
No. The truth is, your client funded this trip

2351
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:03,780
就是想让议员撤销他的提案的
as an inducement for the senator to withdraw his bill.

2352
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:05,490
- 不是这样的吗？ - 完全不是
- Isn't that right?  - Not at all.

2353
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:07,280
我的客户是印尼政府
My client was the Indonesian Government.

2354
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:08,620
这次旅行是由
The trip was sponsored

2355
01:47:08,710 --> 01:47:10,370
环境研究学院赞助的
by the Institute of Environmental Studies,

2356
01:47:10,460 --> 01:47:13,540
一个非盈利的组织
a 501 C-3 non-profit organization.

2357
01:47:13,630 --> 01:47:14,740
整个旅行也是提前
Travel was pre-approved

2358
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:16,670
通过了参议院道德委员会的允许
by the Senate Ethics Committee.

2359
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:19,540
你的客户向这个非盈利组织捐过钱吗？
Has your client ever donated to this non-profit?

2360
01:47:20,010 --> 01:47:21,220
我不得而知
I wouldn't know that.

2361
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:22,920
他们的捐赠人信息是不对外公开的
I'm not privy to their list of donors.

2362
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:26,050
我也没有资格安排这样的资助
Nor had I any role in arranging funding for this.

2363
01:47:26,810 --> 01:47:28,300
- 没有资格？ - 嗯
- No role?  - Mmm.

2364
01:47:29,020 --> 01:47:31,350
那是当然 因为参议院道德准则中
Of course, you couldn't have any role

2365
01:47:31,900 --> 01:47:34,890
明文规定 作为一个说客是严禁
because the Senate Ethics rules prevent lobbyists

2366
01:47:35,230 --> 01:47:38,070
私自为国会成员安排海外旅行的
from arranging overseas travel for members of Congress.

2367
01:47:38,150 --> 01:47:39,360
没错
Indeed.

2368
01:47:43,030 --> 01:47:44,240
你知道这是什么吗？
Do you know what this is?

2369
01:47:46,410 --> 01:47:47,570
可以给你一份复印件
Perhaps we can get you a copy.

2370
01:47:55,550 --> 01:47:56,880
你对这张表格熟悉吗？
Are you familiar with that form?

2371
01:47:58,300 --> 01:48:00,160
熟悉 这是一张私人赞助的保证书
Yes. It's a Private Sponsor Certification Form.

2372
01:48:00,260 --> 01:48:01,870
这张私人赞助保证书的复印件
It's a copy of the same

2373
01:48:02,010 --> 01:48:03,720
跟雅各布议员想要去印尼前
Private Sponsor Certification Form

2374
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:06,040
必须递交给参议院道德委员会
that was submitted to the Senate Ethics Committee

2375
01:48:06,140 --> 01:48:08,850
并得到提前授权的那张表格
to pre-authorize Senator Jacobs' travel

2376
01:48:08,980 --> 01:48:10,140
是一样的
to Indonesia.

2377
01:48:10,690 --> 01:48:13,270
看看这张表格下面的笔迹 斯隆女士
Look at the handwriting on that form, Miss Sloane.

2378
01:48:15,150 --> 01:48:16,850
你能认出这个笔迹吗？
Do you recognize that handwriting?

2379
01:48:17,730 --> 01:48:18,720
能
Yes, I do.

2380
01:48:18,820 --> 01:48:20,100
那是你的笔迹吗？
Is it your handwriting?

2381
01:48:23,110 --> 01:48:24,230
是我的
It is.

2382
01:48:26,450 --> 01:48:28,070
看来我们找到问题了
Well, it seems we have a problem.

2383
01:48:28,830 --> 01:48:30,940
虽然这张表格是由
Even though the form was signed

2384
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:32,150
一个非盈利组织签署和归档的
and filed by the non-profit,

2385
01:48:32,290 --> 01:48:34,000
但填写的人是你
you were the one who filled it out.

2386
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:36,160
这是能够证明你
This is prima evidence

2387
01:48:36,340 --> 01:48:38,290
私自安排国会议员海外旅行的
that you were involved in arranging

2388
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:40,370
第一个证据
overseas travel for a member of Congress.

2389
01:48:41,170 --> 01:48:44,960
这违反了参议院道德准则
Constituting a clear breach of Senate Ethics rules.

2390
01:48:45,220 --> 01:48:46,630
这就是你们的王牌？
Is that your trump card?

2391
01:48:48,260 --> 01:48:49,470
你们把我拖来这里
You drag me in here,

2392
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:51,670
像审讯犯人一样 窥探我的隐私
wedge an endoscope up my posterior,

2393
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:54,560
到最后唯一能让我归罪的东西
and all this time, the only incriminating item

2394
01:48:54,650 --> 01:48:57,260
就是一堆没用的文件？
you have in your possession is a filing snafu?

2395
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:59,220
那监控你要怎么解释 斯隆女士？
How about surveillance, Miss Sloane?

2396
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:02,530
鲁道夫先生在法庭上作证
Mr. Rodolfo Schmidt has stated in deposition

2397
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:05,240
说你有意图用
that you intended to use methods

2398
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:07,030
窃听和黑客技术
such as bugging and tapping

2399
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:10,320
借此欺诈汉克·巴杰利议员 这是真的吗？
to entrap Senator Hank Badgley. ls this true?

2400
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:13,860
我确实有过这种想法 但那只是一瞬间的事
I did, for a brief moment, intend to use such methods.

2401
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:15,990
这种企图并没有得到实施
But that intention was never acted upon.

2402
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:17,200
那是为什么呢？
And why was that?

2403
01:49:17,340 --> 01:49:19,250
因为被斯密特先生制止了
Mr. Schmidt expressly forbade it,

2404
01:49:19,340 --> 01:49:21,290
我相信在他的证词里应该也提到了
as he no doubt told you in his deposition.

2405
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:22,500
但很显然你对实施这样的手段
But you were clearly comfortable

2406
01:49:22,550 --> 01:49:23,580
很是无所谓
with these methods.

2407
01:49:24,050 --> 01:49:27,290
在你的游说生涯中
Did you employ the tactics of espionage

2408
01:49:27,390 --> 01:49:29,590
是否经常雇佣间谍技术？
regularly throughout your lobbying career?

2409
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:30,930
我没有
No, I did not.

2410
01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:32,130
那我换个问题
Then let me ask you this.

2411
01:49:32,140 --> 01:49:34,050
你是否授权 命令
Have you ever authorized, ordered,

2412
01:49:34,140 --> 01:49:35,720
或者自己对他人
or otherwise brought about

2413
01:49:35,900 --> 01:49:38,890
实施过任何一种手段的非法监控？
any kind of unlawful surveillance on any person?

2414
01:49:39,940 --> 01:49:41,930
我先提醒你 在听证会会作伪证
Let me remind you that perjury

2415
01:49:42,030 --> 01:49:43,730
可是项重罪
before Congress is a felony, which...

2416
01:49:43,820 --> 01:49:44,860
我的答案是否定的
The answer is no.

2417
01:49:46,410 --> 01:49:49,570
我从没授权过任何非法的监控行为
I have never authorized illegal surveillance.

2418
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:55,150
这就是我想提的所有问题了
This concludes my questioning of the witness.

2419
01:49:55,250 --> 01:49:56,530
谢谢你 斯隆女士
Thank you, Miss Sloane.

2420
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:07,170
我们还有一个证人
We have one further witness.

2421
01:50:08,930 --> 01:50:10,760
如果你说的不是假话
Either you just perjured yourself,

2422
01:50:10,850 --> 01:50:12,680
那说明你这个人 还没肮脏到那种程度
or you're not so sleazy after all.

2423
01:50:13,430 --> 01:50:15,260
传证人罗伯特·福德先生
The Committee calls Mr. Robert Forde.

2424
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:17,430
这我可没想到
I wouldn't count on that.

2425
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:20,600
主席先生 为什么我事先
Mr. Chairman, I don't recall

2426
01:50:20,730 --> 01:50:22,190
没有收到通知 你要传唤…
being notified of your intention to...

2427
01:50:22,230 --> 01:50:23,270
我们是最近
We were only recently

2428
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:24,690
才找到这位证人的 波斯纳先生
able to locate the witness, Mr. Posner.

2429
01:50:24,690 --> 01:50:25,730
让他们开始
Let it play.

2430
01:50:26,530 --> 01:50:28,190
我能和我的客户谈谈吗？
A moment with my client, please?

2431
01:50:29,030 --> 01:50:30,860
什么情况？罗伯特·福德是谁？
What is this? Who's Robert Forde?

2432
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:33,620
听着 我可以上诉…
Look, I can make a public appeal...

2433
01:50:33,700 --> 01:50:34,740
赶紧开始吧 该死
Let it play, damn it.

2434
01:50:34,830 --> 01:50:36,910
他们不达目的 是不会罢休的
They're going to get it out there one way or another.

2435
01:50:50,430 --> 01:50:52,710
福德先生 请举起你的右手
Mr. Forde, please raise your right hand.

2436
01:50:54,020 --> 01:50:56,050
你愿意庄严宣誓 你所说的话
Do you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth,

2437
01:50:56,140 --> 01:50:58,050
全部都是事情的真相 只有真话
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,

2438
01:50:58,440 --> 01:51:00,180
否则将会受到作伪证的惩罚吗？
under pains and penalties of perjury?

2439
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:02,060
- 我发誓  - 请坐
- I swear.  - Please sit.

2440
01:51:07,860 --> 01:51:10,320
福德先生 你能描述一下
Mr. Forde, could you please describe

2441
01:51:10,410 --> 01:51:11,990
你的工作是什么吗？
the nature of your work?

2442
01:51:14,490 --> 01:51:15,860
我有很多个工作
I got many jobs

2443
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:21,080
那你现在最高收入的工作是什么？
What would you say earns you the most income at present?

2444
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:24,000
我在华盛顿做社交陪同
I work as an escort in D.C.

2445
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:31,420
你靠和女人睡觉赚钱？
You sleep with women for money?

2446
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:33,460
我会满足客户的需求
I meet the clients' needs.

2447
01:51:34,470 --> 01:51:35,680
不管是什么样的
Whatever they may be.

2448
01:51:36,720 --> 01:51:39,340
有时 客户可能都不知道她们有什么需求
Sometimes, the client don't even know what they need.

2449
01:51:40,230 --> 01:51:42,060
我的一部分工作就是帮她们解决问题
Part of my job's to figure that out.

2450
01:51:42,150 --> 01:51:43,760
但有时你的工作要求你
But, sometimes, your job entails

2451
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:46,230
实施性交换取钱财 对吧？
having intercourse for payment?

2452
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:49,190
是的
Yes, sir.

2453
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:52,020
你见过伊丽莎白·斯隆吗？
Have you ever met Elizabeth Sloane?

2454
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:53,650
主席先生 参议院没有权利
Mr. Chairman, the Senate has no business

2455
01:51:53,660 --> 01:51:55,520
窥探斯隆女士的私人生活
prying into the personal affairs of Miss Sloane.

2456
01:51:55,620 --> 01:51:57,040
拉皮条是一种犯罪行为
Solicitation is a criminal offense.

2457
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:59,370
这场听证会的作用就在于
It's well within the remit of this hearing

2458
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:00,790
探讨斯隆女士
to establish whether Miss Sloane

2459
01:52:00,870 --> 01:52:01,910
是否有犯罪行为
has broken any laws.

2460
01:52:02,790 --> 01:52:03,830
福德先生
Mr. Forde.

2461
01:52:04,420 --> 01:52:06,710
你见过斯隆女士吗？
Have you ever met Miss Sloane?

2462
01:52:08,340 --> 01:52:09,370
见过
Yep.

2463
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:11,380
你能指认她吗？
Could you identify her, please?

2464
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:14,840
坐在那边的那个
Sittin' right there.

2465
01:52:15,640 --> 01:52:18,000
你们是什么关系？
What was the nature of your relationship?

2466
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:23,140
我跟一个客户参加了一个晚会
a function with a client.

2467
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:25,970
我想上前搭汕 但是吃了闭门羹
I tried to introduce myself, but she bucked me off.

2468
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:29,820
福德先生 斯隆女士是否
Mr. Forde, have you ever

2469
01:52:29,900 --> 01:52:31,310
当过你的客户？
entertained Miss Sloane as a client?

2470
01:52:36,450 --> 01:52:37,490
没有
No, sir.

2471
01:52:39,290 --> 01:52:41,150
我能出具两条具有法律效应的证词
I can produce sworn statements

2472
01:52:41,250 --> 01:52:43,660
是出自卡弗酒店的两位员工的
from two employees of the Carver Hotel,

2473
01:52:43,750 --> 01:52:46,660
他们都说看见斯隆女士出现在大厅
to the effect that they saw Miss Sloane in the lobby

2474
01:52:47,130 --> 01:52:48,910
而在同一天 你在那里
on the same day that you, Mr. Forde,

2475
01:52:49,010 --> 01:52:50,500
也接受了预约
held a reservation there.

2476
01:52:50,970 --> 01:52:52,000
我再问一遍
I ask again.

2477
01:52:52,180 --> 01:52:56,040
你是否出于金钱交换 取悦过斯隆女士？
Did you entertain Miss Sloane in any capacity, for profit?

2478
01:52:56,260 --> 01:52:57,500
没有 先生
No, sir. I did not.

2479
01:53:01,060 --> 01:53:02,720
谢谢你 福德先生
Thank you, Mr. Forde.

2480
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:04,850
你可以走了
You're dismissed.

2481
01:53:10,490 --> 01:53:12,270
诉讼程序的结果将会在明天公布
These proceedings will conclude tomorrow,

2482
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:16,940
斯隆女士的情况会交由参议院道德委员会
when Miss Sloane is referred to the Senate Ethics Committee

2483
01:53:17,030 --> 01:53:18,400
做最后的评判
for their judgment.

2484
01:53:29,050 --> 01:53:31,290
真不相信那群混蛋 居然找到那个家伙…
I can't believe those fuckers dragged that guy...

2485
01:53:31,380 --> 01:53:32,540
罗斯？
Ross?

2486
01:53:36,430 --> 01:53:37,800
我们的老朋友希顿·哈里斯怎么样了？
How's our old friend Heaton-Harris?

2487
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:42,810
整个话题的热度降到了冰点
Comatose. The whole issue's gone cold.

2488
01:53:44,810 --> 01:53:46,300
这就是他们想要的结果
That is what they wanted.

2489
01:53:47,610 --> 01:53:49,690
有什么办法能让它“起死回生”
We all know what it would take to revive it.

2490
01:53:50,780 --> 01:53:52,890
一场地震吧
Seriously, an earthquake.

2491
01:53:55,410 --> 01:53:57,240
我们已经尽力了
We got closer than we had any right to.

2492
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:07,580
我们明天都会到场的
We'll all be there tomorrow.

2493
01:54:41,870 --> 01:54:43,320
斯隆女士 请看这边
Excuse me, Miss Sloane, over here.

2494
01:54:43,370 --> 01:54:44,450
能问你个问题吗？
May I have a comment?

2495
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:03,670
早上好
Good morning.

2496
01:55:09,900 --> 01:55:12,310
在我们向国会道德委员会的成员
Before referring the witness's testimony

2497
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:14,430
提交证人证词之前
to the Office of Congressional Ethics,

2498
01:55:14,530 --> 01:55:16,140
她有权进行自我陈述
she is entitled to make a statement.

2499
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:22,400
斯隆女士 你有什么想说的吗？
Miss Sloane, is there something you'd like to say?

2500
01:55:35,670 --> 01:55:37,960
主席先生 我的客户不想做自我陈述
Mr. Chairman, my client does not wish to make a statement.

2501
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:40,880
很好
Very well.

2502
01:55:40,970 --> 01:55:42,470
我现在就将证词
I will now read the referral

2503
01:55:42,550 --> 01:55:44,290
提交给道德委员会的成员…
to the office of Congressional Ethics...

2504
01:55:44,390 --> 01:55:46,180
议员 我有话想说
There is something I'd like to say, Senator.

2505
01:56:15,710 --> 01:56:18,550
我一直被媒体 和这场听证会
I have been censured by the press and by this hearing

2506
01:56:19,380 --> 01:56:20,790
责备为
as a parasite

2507
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:23,370
美国民主的寄生虫
on American democracy.

2508
01:56:24,640 --> 01:56:27,170
他们暗讽我引导枪支管制的
It's insinuated that I led the fight

2509
01:56:28,220 --> 01:56:32,430
运动只是为了自身事业的利益
for increased gun regulation in the interest of my career.

2510
01:56:35,060 --> 01:56:37,180
但有时我们行动 并不是为了自己
Sometimes we act, not for ourselves,

2511
01:56:39,610 --> 01:56:41,940
而是出于最简单最纯粹的理由
but because we believe plainly and simply

2512
01:56:42,070 --> 01:56:43,400
那就是我们相信这么做是对的
it is the right thing to do.

2513
01:56:43,610 --> 01:56:46,070
斯隆女士 这和我们昨天讨论的话题有关吗…
Miss Sloane, is this pertinent to the discussions we...

2514
01:56:46,160 --> 01:56:49,240
我有权说我想说的话 议员
I understand I have the right to say what I wish, Senator.

2515
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:51,410
那你继续
Proceed.

2516
01:56:53,580 --> 01:56:55,160
我相信希顿·哈里斯法案
I believe the Heaton-Harris Bill

2517
01:56:55,330 --> 01:56:56,590
就是正确的事
is the right thing to do.

2518
01:56:59,590 --> 01:57:00,870
但同时我又意识到
But I also recognize

2519
01:57:01,420 --> 01:57:05,460
这并不是驱使我前进的动力
that this wasn't what motivated me.

2520
01:57:08,140 --> 01:57:10,510
当我被给予这个团队的领导职位
When I was offered a position on the campaign,

2521
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:12,590
我被所面临的的挑战所吸引
I was in thrall to the challenge.

2522
01:57:15,020 --> 01:57:19,810
我做出的决定是基于我想获胜的欲望
My decision to accept was based on my desire to win.

2523
01:57:23,650 --> 01:57:25,610
获得前所未有的胜利
And to win bigger than I ever had before.

2524
01:57:29,870 --> 01:57:32,740
但很显然我的一些行为已经越过了
It's clear that my behavior has fallen well short

2525
01:57:34,330 --> 01:57:37,450
可接受的道德规范
of acceptable ethical standards.

2526
01:57:39,300 --> 01:57:43,330
因为自己的偏执 我的越界行为
I've crossed lines with devastating consequences

2527
01:57:44,550 --> 01:57:46,380
已造成了毁灭性的伤害
in the service of my obsession.

2528
01:57:48,850 --> 01:57:50,880
我背叛了和我最亲近的人
I've betrayed the people closest to me.

2529
01:57:54,350 --> 01:57:55,840
把他们的生命置于危险之中
I've endangered lives.

2530
01:57:58,900 --> 01:58:00,510
比起什么填写文档的违规行为
I deserve censure for this

2531
01:58:01,570 --> 01:58:04,650
我更愿意因为这些事而受到惩责
far more than for any filing irregularity.

2532
01:58:07,700 --> 01:58:10,160
当提到希顿·哈里斯法案的时候 我希望
When they consider the Heaton-Harris Bill, I wish

2533
01:58:11,490 --> 01:58:13,200
国会的每个成员
that each member of Congress

2534
01:58:13,330 --> 01:58:15,570
都能追随榜样的力量 我说的不是自己
would follow the example set, not by me,

2535
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:19,870
而是坐在我身后的这群人
but by the group of people that sit behind me.

2536
01:58:21,710 --> 01:58:24,050
他们为自己所坚持正确的事情
Who have made great sacrifices

2537
01:58:24,670 --> 01:58:28,170
付出了太多 也牺牲了太多
in the name of doing what they believe is right.

2538
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:33,920
我希望国会成员投票的时候
I wish that those members would use their votes,

2539
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:37,930
想的不是他们自己的政治利益
not in the interest of their political advancement,

2540
01:58:38,770 --> 01:58:43,190
而是他们心中所坚信 对自己国家有好处的东西
but for what they believe is right for their country.

2541
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:46,940
但我知道我的希望要破碎了
But I know my wishes are wasted.

2542
01:58:48,450 --> 01:58:50,110
因为这一切是不会发生的
And that this will never happen.

2543
01:58:51,410 --> 01:58:54,870
因为我们的政府腐败了
Because our system is rotten.

2544
01:58:57,420 --> 01:58:59,660
现在的生存之道并不会奖赏那些
It doesn't reward honest politicians,

2545
01:58:59,750 --> 01:59:01,040
凭良知投票的 正直的政治家
who vote with their conscience.

2546
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:04,210
它只会奖赏
It rewards

2547
01:59:05,300 --> 01:59:06,460
卑鄙小人
rats

2548
01:59:07,550 --> 01:59:09,340
那些为了能分一杯羹
who are willing to sell out their country

2549
01:59:09,430 --> 01:59:10,760
而愿意出卖自己国家的人
to keep their noses in the trough.

2550
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:14,260
恕我直言
Make no mistake.

2551
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:18,340
这些卑鄙小人才是美国民主
These rats are the real parasites

2552
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:20,980
真正的寄生虫
on American democracy.

2553
01:59:34,240 --> 01:59:36,910
我早就预想到 一旦我们为希顿·哈里斯法案
I anticipated if we had sufficient success

2554
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:38,990
争取来足够的选票
in lobbying for the Heaton-Harris Bill,

2555
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:40,450
就会有人想
there may be

2556
01:59:41,670 --> 01:59:43,580
对我实施人身攻击 或信誉攻击
an assault against me personally,

2557
01:59:45,250 --> 01:59:49,500
来阻止我们的势头 或者破坏我们的公信力
to stall our momentum and to damage our credibility.

2558
01:59:52,760 --> 01:59:54,250
游说在于先见之明
Lobbying is about foresight.

2559
01:59:56,100 --> 01:59:58,090
在于分析对手将会采取的计划
About anticipating your opponent's moves

2560
02:00:00,270 --> 02:00:01,480
然后再制定相应的应对办法
and devising counter-measures.

2561
02:00:02,310 --> 02:00:03,810
我想跟你谈谈我未来的发展
I'd like to discuss my future.

2562
02:00:04,770 --> 02:00:06,480
现在不是时候 小可爱
This is hardly the time, cookie.

2563
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:10,610
最后的赢家总会比对手多留一手
The winner plots one step ahead of the opposition,

2564
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:15,820
并在对方亮出王牌后 再拿出自己的杀手锏
and plays a trump card just after they play theirs.

2565
02:00:16,700 --> 02:00:18,070
事实上 现在正是时候
Actually, it is the time.

2566
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:20,240
关键就在于你要
It's about making sure

2567
02:00:20,290 --> 02:00:21,500
让他们大吃一惊
you surprise them.

2568
02:00:22,630 --> 02:00:24,040
这他妈是什么？
The fuck is this?

2569
02:00:24,790 --> 02:00:26,160
而他们的一举一动都在你的预料之中
And that they don't surprise you.

2570
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:28,380
我的辞职信
My resignation.

2571
02:00:28,970 --> 02:00:30,630
我更适合学术界
Academia's more my scene.

2572
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:38,630
当我离开科尔 克拉维茨 和沃特曼的时候
When I left Cole, Kravitz, and Waterman,

2573
02:00:39,850 --> 02:00:43,180
我在他们的队伍中 安插了眼线
I retained an operative of mine in their ranks.

2574
02:00:44,860 --> 02:00:46,220
听好 简
All right, Jane.

2575
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:47,600
联系鲁道夫·施密特 告诉他
Contact Rodolfo Schmidt and tell him

2576
02:00:47,650 --> 02:00:48,980
我们一共有六个人会过去
there is a total of six coming over.

2577
02:00:49,030 --> 02:00:50,060
谁说我要去了？
Who says I'm coming?

2578
02:00:50,990 --> 02:00:52,270
一场捏造指控的听证会
A plan was hatched to

2579
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:53,480
在某个枪支管制反对派的命令下
bankroll a trumped-up hearing

2580
02:00:54,030 --> 02:00:55,820
就这么开始预谋了
at the behest of the gun lobby.

2581
02:00:55,910 --> 02:00:57,410
一定有我们遗漏的东西
There's got to be something.

2582
02:00:59,370 --> 02:01:00,450
真惊讶 你居然接电话了
I'm surprised you picked up.

2583
02:01:00,580 --> 02:01:02,040
抱歉 你打错了
I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.

2584
02:01:03,750 --> 02:01:05,290
她违反了参议院道德准则
She's in breach of Senate Ethics rules.

2585
02:01:06,340 --> 02:01:07,500
我们有证据
We can prove it.

2586
02:01:08,210 --> 02:01:10,330
我开始监视乔治·杜邦
I placed George Dupont under surveillance

2587
02:01:11,550 --> 02:01:13,340
发现他和一名国会议员见面
until he met with a member of Congress

2588
02:01:13,890 --> 02:01:15,920
很遗憾 这位议员道德沦丧
who exhibited sufficient moral bankruptcy

2589
02:01:16,350 --> 02:01:18,720
和他勾结在一起 设了这个局
to collude with such a plan.

2590
02:01:18,850 --> 02:01:20,010
去吧
And go.

2591
02:01:23,770 --> 02:01:25,560
那个人就是
That member was

2592
02:01:25,690 --> 02:01:28,020
罗纳德·迈克尔·斯珀林议员
Senator Ronald Michael Sperling.

2593
02:01:30,230 --> 02:01:31,270
注意秩序
Order.

2594
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:33,360
这个平台不是给你
This is not a platform you can use

2595
02:01:33,450 --> 02:01:35,150
发表这种恶意指控和诽谤的
to make malicious, defamatory accusations...

2596
02:01:35,240 --> 02:01:37,030

下载一个名为“地震”的文件
Download a file named "Earthquake."

2600
02:01:54,550 --> 02:01:56,510
我不能嘴上说一套
I can't vote for it with one hand

2601
02:01:56,590 --> 02:01:58,210
背地里做一套…
and choke it with the other...

2602
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:08,600
快去准备车
Get the car.

2603
02:02:18,280 --> 02:02:20,740
鉴于以上陈诉 本次听证会休庭
In light of these allegations, this hearing is adjourned.

2604
02:02:29,420 --> 02:02:30,830
让开 让开 让开
Back up, please. Back up. Back up.

2605

[一个有着坚定信仰的说客 这种信仰不仅存在于对自己取胜的能力]

2606
02:03:04,950 --> 02:03:09,700
[对于我的无私付出 彼得森怀亚特的回报是0元]

2607
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:44,400
[马里兰 安德森市 联邦惩教所]

2608
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:49,150
[马里兰 安德森市 联邦惩教所]
[十个月后]

2609
02:04:07,890 --> 02:04:09,260
你居然愿意出来
I'm surprised you showed.

2610
02:04:10,060 --> 02:04:11,140
我听说很多人来看你
I hear I'm not the only one

2611
02:04:11,190 --> 02:04:12,520
都被你拒绝了
whose visits you've been refusing.

2612
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:16,850
你看上去气色不错
You look good.

2613
02:04:17,690 --> 02:04:19,700
如果你没有老二 监狱不算是个坏地方
Prison's not so bad if you don't have a penis.

2614
02:04:20,200 --> 02:04:22,480
我们不会在别人身上发泄 自己解决就行了
We don't shank each other, we form self-help groups.

2615
02:04:24,030 --> 02:04:25,440
监狱里有卖润唇膏的地方
There's a black market in lip gloss.

2616
02:04:25,700 --> 02:04:26,690
嗯
Hmm.

2617
02:04:27,950 --> 02:04:28,990
为什么同意见我？
Why this time?

2618
02:04:31,420 --> 02:04:32,870
他们告诉我 这次是公事
They told me it was business.

2619
02:04:33,420 --> 02:04:34,700
没错 额…
Yeah. Um...

2620
02:04:35,550 --> 02:04:36,830
关于斯珀林和杜邦的听证会
Now that the Sperling and Dupont hearings

2621
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:37,910
已经提上了日程
are on the schedule,

2622
02:04:38,050 --> 02:04:39,500
我在帮你申请提前释放
I'm petitioning for an early release.

2623
02:04:40,260 --> 02:04:41,540
你看上去也很精神
You look good, too, by the way.

2624
02:04:42,050 --> 02:04:43,380
谢谢
Thank you.

2625
02:04:44,720 --> 02:04:48,210
你只需要再待四个月 最多六个月
I think we are looking at four, maybe six months.

2626
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:55,110
你计划了整件事
You instigated the whole thing.

2627
02:04:58,280 --> 02:04:59,770
将自己全副武装起来
You weaponized yourself,

2628
02:05:01,110 --> 02:05:02,650
跟美国国会大厦的人来个正面对峙
brought the roof of the US Capitol

2629
02:05:02,740 --> 02:05:04,070
结果弄得两败俱伤
crashing down on your head.

2630
02:05:04,990 --> 02:05:07,150
为了什么 就为了一个枪支法案？
For what, a gun bill?

2631
02:05:09,160 --> 02:05:11,450
- 这很有效 不是吗？ - 祝贺你
- Worked, didn't it?  - Well, congrats.

2632
02:05:12,420 --> 02:05:13,830
罪犯现在买枪
Criminals must now endure the hassle

2633
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:15,660
都只能去黑市买了
of procuring their guns on the black market.

2634
02:05:17,500 --> 02:05:19,120
这样断送自己的前程 真的值得吗？
Was that really worth your career?

2635
02:05:21,670 --> 02:05:23,260
如果你把因为工作而自杀 和断送自己的工作
Career suicide is not so bad when you

2636
02:05:23,430 --> 02:05:26,010
两者进行比较 就不会觉得这有什么大不了了
consider the alternative is suicide by career.

2637
02:05:27,930 --> 02:05:29,090
我的医生会告诉你
My doctor would tell you

2638
02:05:29,640 --> 02:05:31,430
我服刑表现很好的
I've served my interest very well.

2639
02:05:34,190 --> 02:05:35,180
嗯
Hmm.

2640
02:05:38,150 --> 02:05:39,430
谢谢你来看我 丹尼尔
Thanks for coming, Daniel.

2641
02:05:42,150 --> 02:05:43,360
我很好奇
I'm curious.

2642
02:05:46,120 --> 02:05:47,530
你签署的那个文件？
Your little filing snafu?

2643
02:05:49,450 --> 02:05:50,910
你是故意在上面签字的
You filled out that form deliberately.

2644
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:52,370
那也是你计划的一部分 给他们设下圈套
That was you, throwing them a bone.

2645
02:05:53,660 --> 02:05:55,950
如果没有那个文件 也不会推动他们举办听证会
Without it, they would have nothing to incite the hearing.

2646
02:05:57,170 --> 02:05:59,080
你没有义务回答这个问题
And you're under no obligation to answer that.

2647
02:06:05,340 --> 02:06:06,830
而且整件事你完全没有
And you neglected to mention this

2648
02:06:06,970 --> 02:06:08,130
告诉团队的成员 是因为…
to any of your team because...

2649
02:06:08,180 --> 02:06:09,290
至少需要五年的信任
Five years minimum.

2650
02:06:16,230 --> 02:06:17,440
我会再来看你的
I'll be seeing you.

2651
