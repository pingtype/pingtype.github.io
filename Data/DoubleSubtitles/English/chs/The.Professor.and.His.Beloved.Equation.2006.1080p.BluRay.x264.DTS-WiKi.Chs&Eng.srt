圆周率是3.141592653
(pi) equals 3.141592653

7
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,260
真痛苦，为什么不直接是三呢？
What a pain Why don't they just make it 3?

8
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,300
如果你把它变成三，就会得到一个正六边形，不是圆
If you made it 3, you'd get a hexagon, not a circle

9
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,570
嘿，阿根来了！
Hey, Root's here!

10
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,590
起立！
Rise

11
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,080
敬礼！
Bow

12
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,290
坐下！
Sit

13
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,270
接下来的一年，我会是你们的数学老师
I'll be your math teacher for the next year

14
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:28,380
你们已经知道了…我是阿根
You already know... I'm Root

15
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,150
你们看，今天我的发型不好看
As you see, I'm having a bad-hair day

16
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,430
今天，我希望你们了解一下我
Today, I want you to learn a little about me

17
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:49,230
这不是上课，所以你们不用记笔记
This isn't a lesson, so you don't have to take notes

18
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,810
他们叫我阿根
They've been calling me "Root,"

19
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,980
叫了十九年
for 19 years now

20
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,550
我得到了阿根这个名字，爱上了数学
The way I came by the name Root, fell in love with math,

21
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,680
直到今天站在了你们面前…
and ended up in front of you...

博士的爱情方程式
THE PROFESSOR AND HIS BELOVED EQUATION

23
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,020
我妈妈爱上了一个人，但不能跟他结婚
My mother loved someone she couldn't marry

24
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,830
她独自一人抚养我
and raised me on her own

25
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,330
没有受教育，而且无依无靠，我妈妈成为了一名管家
Uneducated and lonely, my mother became a housekeeper

26
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,770
因为对于她来说
because It was the only option available

27
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,540
那是唯一的选择
for a person of her talents

28
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:11,210
你的新客户可能有点难缠
Your new clients may be a bit of a handful

29
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,960
在过去的几年里，他们已经换了九个管家
They've gone through 9 housekeepers in the past few years

30
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,490
虽然我妈妈是家政中心最年轻的管家
Though the youngest housekeeper at the agency,

31
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,330
但是她已经有了十年工作经验
she already had 10 years experience

32
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,930
我英勇的妈妈
My spirited mother

33
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,000
以极大的自豪感追求着她的事业
pursued her profession with a fierce pride

34
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,960
打搅一下
Excuse me

35
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,400
我希望你照顾我弟弟
I would like you to look after my brother-in-law

36
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,830
弟弟…
Brother-in-law...

37
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,440
你丈夫的弟弟？
Your husband's brother?

38
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,810
没有人可以做很久
No one lasts long

39
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:18,710
每一次找了新人，我们都要从头开始
Every time we get someone new, we have to start all over again

40
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,410
真是麻烦
It's such a bother

41
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:27,290
这不是什么复杂的事情
I'm not asking for anything complicated

42
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,120
只是给他做吃的，照顾他
Just feed and look after him

43
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,490
从早上十一点到下午七点
from 11AM to 7PM

44
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,900
你弟弟在哪？
Where is your brother?

45
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,550
不要在堂屋和走廊之间走来走去
Don't come and go between the annex and the main house

46
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,610
你在我弟弟的房间工作
You work in my brother-in-law's house

47
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,490
他所有的事情
And it's up to you to solve

48
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,290
你要自己想办法解决
any problems with him yourself

49
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,290
你必须承诺这一点
You must promise me that

50
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,130
我会的
I will

51
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,100
要见一下你弟弟吗？
Shall I meet your brother?

52
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,000
没有必要
There's no need

53
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:21,510
即使他今天见了你，明天也不记得了
Even if he meets you today, he won't remember you tomorrow

54
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,820
什么意思？
What do you mean?

55
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,160
换句话说，坦白一点，他记忆出了问题
In other words, frankly, his memory is impeded

56
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,990
在一次交通事故中他大脑受到了撞击
He hit his head in a traffic accident

57
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,700
那次事故中我的腿瘸了
The same accident left me lame

58
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,870
我弟弟的记忆
My brother's memories

59
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,340
还停留在那天晚上
stop with the night we saw

60
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,350
我们一起在兴福寺的篝火旁看能舞的时候
a Noh play by bonfire at Kohfukuji Temple,

61
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,420
那是一九七五年的春天
in the Spring of 1975

62
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,420
事故已经过去了十年，但是在他看来
It's been 10 years since the accident, but in his mind,

63
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,850
我们昨天才刚刚看了能舞表演…
we've always just seen the Noh play yesterday...

64
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,860
换句话说，那些事情发生在昨晚
In other words, it always just happened last night

65
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,070
十年只有一天？
Ten years in a single day?

66
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,870
他甚至没有意识到我日渐衰老
He doesn't even realize that I age with each day's passing

67
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,380
十年前的我
The way I was 10 years ago,

68
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,350
是他现在脑海中的我…
is all he can see...

69
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:36,620
也是他以后脑海中的我
AlI he will ever see

70
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,390
不管什么事情，他的记忆都只持续八十分钟
In any event, his memory lasts 80 minutes

71
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:49,070
刚好是一小时二十分钟
That's exactly an hour and 20 minutes

72
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,670
周而复始
Over and over again

73
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,300
那么…
So...

74
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:02,210
周一早上十一点见？
I'll see you at 11am, Monday morning?

75
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,410
好
Yes

76
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:34,140
就这样，我妈妈成为了博士的管家
And so my mother came to work as a housekeeper in the professor's house

77
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,050
博士之所以能够学习数学
The professor had been able to pursue his study of mathematics

78
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,120
到英国的剑桥大学读书
all the way to Cambridge University in England,

79
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,590
得益于他哥哥在家族纺织品生意上的成功
thanks to his older brother's success in an inherited textile business

80
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,690
资助小弟弟完成了学业
which financed the much younger man's education

81
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,590
在获得博士学位之后
After he earned his Ph.D.,

82
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,400
他在一个数学研究所找到了工作
and found a position in mathematics research,

83
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,570
他哥哥去世了
his older brother passed away

84
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,340
哥哥的遗孀关闭了工厂
and his widow closed the factory,

85
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,570
在原来的地产上建起了公寓
built apartments on the property moved out to the country,

86
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,150
他们搬到农村，靠公寓收租生活
and lived on income from the apartments

87
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:16,150
但是，他们舒适的生活
But their comfortable lives

88
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,230
因为那场事故而改变了
were shattered by the accident

89
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,950
博士失去了工作
The professor lost his position,

90
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:25,830
靠嫂子养活
and became dependent on his sister-in-law's charity

91
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,880
你好！我是管家
Hello! I'm the housekeeper

92
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,890
你好！
Hello!

93
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,810
你好，我是新管家
Hello I'm your new housekeeper

94
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,530
你好
Hello

95
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,860
你的鞋子多少尺寸？
What's your shoe size?

96
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,770
二十四厘米
24 centimeters

97
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,910
哦，真是个尊贵的数字…
My, what a noble number...

98
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,820
是4的阶乘
It's the factorial of 4

99
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,350
什么是阶乘？
What is a factorial?

100
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,850
你将1到4的所有数字相乘
If you multiply all the whole numbers from 1 to 4,

101
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,820
得24
you get 24

102
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,360
你电话号码多少？
What's your telephone number?

103
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,590
五七六-一四五五
576-1455

104
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,100
你说5761455？
Did you say 5,761,455?

105
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,780
哦，太棒了
Why, that's wonderful

106
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:24,110
这跟十亿内的质数相等
That's equivalent to the prime numbers up to one billion

107
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,450
不管怎样，进来吧
In any event, come in

108
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,460
我工作很忙，没人管你
I'm busy working, so you're on your own

109
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,520
来吧，你自己管好自己
Go ahead and suit yourself

110
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,960
从那天开始
As of that day,

111
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:42,830
我妈妈跟博士重复每天早上的数学问侯
my mother and the professor repeated this mathematical greeting every morning

112
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,070
对于一个只有八十分钟记忆的博士
For the professor, whose memory spanned 80 minutes,

113
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:52,230
我妈妈永远都是新管家
my mother was always the new housekeeper

114
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,910
对于博士而言，培养数字
For the professor, bringing up math

115
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,280
在交流上是个悲剧
was a communication strategy

116
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:03,650
当他对说什么感到困惑的时候
When he was confused about what to say,

117
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:08,360
数字就会取代文字
numbers could always take the place of words

118
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,000
阶乘的“阶”
This character in the word "factorial"

119
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,190
指的是这些阶梯
is the character for staircase

120
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,300
“乘”是指相乘
The other character means multiply

121
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,070
所有数字
Whole numbers,

122
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,110
是指这些整数从1，2，3，4开始，无限延伸
refer to the integers which start 1, 2, 3, 4 and extend nfinitely

123
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,810
把这几个数相乘，得24
Multiply these and you get 24

124
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,180
那么24是4的阶乘
So 24 is the factorial of 4

125
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,350
现在，谁可以说出五的阶乘？
Now, who knows what the factorial of 5 is?

126
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,360
可以！124
Yes! 120

127
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,690
正确
Correct

128
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,700
七的阶乘呢？
How about the factorial of 7?

129
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,360
5，040
5,040

130
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,160
正确
Correct

131
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,970
你反应很快
You're fast

132
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,340
“素数”中的“素”
This character in "prime number"

133
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,970
是真实的意思
means genuine

134
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,650
天然而不加修饰
Like something genuine without embellishment

135
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,590
换句话说，只能被1或数字本身整除的数字
In other words, a number which is on y divisible by 1 or itself

136
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,420
例如…
For instance...

137
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:17,850
2，3，5，7
2, 3, 5, 7,

138
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,560
11，13，17
11, 13, 17,

139
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:28,340
19，23，29…
19, 23, 29...

140
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,140
这些素数
These prime numbers

141
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,780
就像天空中无穷尽的星星
are as infinite as the stars in the night sky

142
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,440
不受任何已知法则的支配
No known rules govern them

143
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:43,350
我在这里，完全自立
I am here, utterly self-sustaining

144
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,990
换句话说，就像你们每一个都是独一无二的
In other words, just like all of you, each one is unique

145
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,690
绝对高贵不屈
Utterly noble and unbending,

146
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,330
这些数字保持孤高
these numbers remain aloof

147
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,070
“孤高”
"Aloof"

148
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,910
博士在世界上最珍视的
What the professor cherished most in this world,

149
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,810
是这些素数
were these prime numbers

150
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,220
他真的爱数字吗？
Did he really ove numbers?

151
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,430
当然，他爱的对象可能有点怪，但爱情本身不奇怪
Sure, the object of his affect ons may have been eccentric, but not his love

152
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,490
他珍视它们，陪伴它们，不求回报
He cherished them, served them without compensation,

153
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,960
永远，尊重它们
respected them, always

154
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,060
不离不弃，一刻也不抛下它们
never straying from them for even a moment

155
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,220
很抱歉打搅您
I'm sorry to bother you

156
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,130
您中饭想吃什么？
What would you like for lunch?

157
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,110
有什么喜欢的，或者不喜欢的吗？
Any preferences, dislikes or allergies?

158
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,540
告诉我好一些
It would help to know

159
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,040
您有什么意见？
What do you think?

160
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,880
我会去准备一些吃的，您有什么意见？
I can go ahead and just fix something, but what do you think?

161
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,560
欢迎说出您的想法
I'd welcome your opinion

162
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,200
我没什么说的
I have nothing to say

163
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,570
现在，我在思考
I'm thinking, now

164
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:09,300
你闯了进来，打搅了我去爱我的数字
You come barging in and interrupt my love for my numbers

165
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,370
就像偷窥人家上厕所一样粗鲁
It's as rude as peeping into a toilet

166
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,740
非常抱歉，请原谅
I'm terribly sorry Excuse me

167
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,450
我的记忆只能持续八十分钟
My memory lasts only 80 minutes

168
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,180
新管家
The new housekeeper

169
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,300
您可以多吃点吗？我做了很多
Would you care for more? I made plenty

170
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,440
四月七日
April 7th

171
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,360
日子一天天过去
Every day adds to the others

172
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,500
我们应该心怀感激，春天终于来了
We should be grateful spring has finally come

173
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,640
你好！
Hello!

174
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,120
你好
Hello

175
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,390
我是你的新管家
I'm your new housekeeper

176
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,330
你的鞋子多少尺寸？
What's your shoe size?

177
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,190
二十四
24,

178
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,900
四的阶乘
the factorial of 4

179
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:43,370
真好
That's wonderful

180
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,850
多么尊贵的数字…
What a noble number...

181
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,900
打搅一下
Excuse me

182
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,030
在
Yes

183
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,770
请帮我把这个寄到
Please send this to The Journal of Mathematics,

184
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,040
这个地址
at this address

185
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,240
好，没有问题
Sure, no problem

186
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,740
寄平信吗？
By regular mail?

187
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,980
对
Yes

188
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,590
一百七十元
That'I be 170 yen

189
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,270
谢谢你
Thank you

190
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,150
我回来了
I'm home

191
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,660
欢迎你回来，谢谢你帮忙
Welcome home, thanks for your work

192
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,690
不用谢
Not at all

193
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,630
你经常把论文投递给杂志吗？
Do you often submit your papers to magazines?

194
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,080
对…
Right...

195
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:32,510
我把我的证明寄给了《数学杂志》三十七期，今天…
I sent my proof to The Journal of Mathematics, Vol. 37 today...

196
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,910
很好
That's good

197
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,550
哦，不！
Oh, no!

198
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:43,160
我应该寄快件，只有第一个寄到的才可以拿现金奖
I should've sent it express Only First Place takes a cash prize

199
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:48,000
不，没有必要寄快件
No, there's no need to send it express

200
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,570
比其他人更早给出证明，这很重要
It's important to arrive at the truth before anyone else,

201
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:58,210
但更重要的是这个证明要漂亮
but it's more important that the proof be beautiful

202
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,850
证明还有漂亮和丑陋？
There are such things as beautiful or ugly proofs?

203
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,210
当然有
Of course

204
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:10,820
在一个真正正确的证明里
In a truly correct proof,

205
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:17,450
无懈可击而引人注目的推理
air-tight and compelling reasoning coexists without contradiction,

206
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,160
与柔顺的逻辑共存，毫无冲突
with supple logic

207
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,440
就像没有人可以证明为什么星星很漂亮
Just as no one can prove why stars are beautiful,

208
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:31,040
要表达数学的美，很难
it's difficult to express the beauty of mathematics

209
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:38,310
你什么时候生日？
What's your birthday?

210
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,880
二月二十日
February 20th

211
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,520
多么迷人的数字
What a charming number

212
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,230
看一下这个
Take a look at this

213
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,570
在大学的时候
Back in college,

214
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:00,230
我关于超越数的论文获得了校长奖
I won the President's award for my paper on Transcendental Number theory

215
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,640
了不起的荣誉！
What a great honor

216
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,710
不，这没关系
No, that doesn't matter

217
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,970
你可以读出这个数字吗？
Can you read the number?

218
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,790
“学长奖，284号”
"President's Award No. 284"

219
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:17,520
意思是你是第284个获得这个奖的人？
Does that mean you're the 284th person to receive the honor?

220
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,690
我想是的
I suppose

221
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:25,030
问题是284和220
The question is 284 and 220

222
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,060
没时间洗碗了，跟我走
This is no time to be washing dishes Come with me

223
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,720
你有什么想法？
What do you think?

224
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:59,930
这个，我…
Well, I...

225
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,770
都有三个阿拉伯数字…
Both have 3 digits...

226
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,510
我可以怎么表达呢？
How can I phrase this?

227
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,240
在超市的肉类柜台上
At the meat counter at the supermarket,

228
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:19,310
如果有两袋绞碎的牛肉，一袋220克，另一袋284克
if there are two packets of ground beef, one 220 grams the other 284,

229
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:21,610
对我看来就是一样的
they seem the same to me

230
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,020
扫一眼，看上去相似
One quick glance and they look similar

231
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:30,090
它们都在200那一排，而且所有数字都是偶数
They're both in the 200 range and all the numbers are even

232
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,790
目光敏锐
That's a keen insight

233
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,230
直觉很重要
Intuition is important

234
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,540
从你的内心，直观地抓住数字
Grasp the numbers intuitively, from your heart

235
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,740
你知道约数吗？
You know what a divisor is?

236
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:45,880
对，我想我还记得以前学过…
Yes, I think so I remember studying them...

237
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:50,910
我们把220和284的约数都写出来
Let's write out all the divisors for 220 and 284,

238
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,580
除了它们自身
excepting themse ves

239
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:01,530
1，2，4，5，10
1, 2, 4, 5, 10

240
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,130
11，20，22
11, 20, 22,

241
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:10,970
44，55，110
44, 55, 110,

242
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,310
1，2，4
1, 2, 4,

243
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,500
71，142
71, 142

244
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,910
你可以在心里面算出所有的约数？
You can calculate all those divisors in your head?

245
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:27,080
我只是用到你刚才所用的直觉
I'm just using the same intuition you did

246
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,320
进入下一步
Onto the next step

247
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,070
加起来
Add it up

248
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,870
慢慢来
Take your t me

249
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,020
做好了
I'm done

250
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,860
正确
Correct

251
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,760
你会这样看吗？
Will you behold,

252
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,320
这个漂亮的数字链
this beautiful chain of numbers

253
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,870
将所有284的约数加起来，得220
Add all the divisors for 284 and you get 220

254
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:57,600
将所有220的约数加起来，得284
Add all the divisors for 220 and you get 284

255
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,570
它们是亲和数
They're amicable numbers

256
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,980
亲和数？
Amicable numbers?

257
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:20,620
亲和数
Amicable Numbers

258
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,770
这种配对很稀少
Such pairs are very rare

259
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:30,810
即使是费马和笛卡尔，也只是每人发现了一对
Even Fermat and Descartes only discovered one pair each

260
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:37,580
它们是上帝的设计，要彼此相亲相爱
They're numbers bound to each other by God's design

261
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,210
上帝的设计…
God's design...

262
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,950
美吗？
Isn't it beautiful?

263
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:50,990
你的生日，跟我手表上刻的数字
Your birthday and the number engraved on my wristwatch

264
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:55,070
完美地纠缠在一起
are so perfectly intertwined

265
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,310
第一个发现亲和数的是毕达哥拉斯
The first person to discover amicable numbers was Pythagoras

266
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,800
毕达哥拉斯作出了他的著名论断
Pythagoras made his famous statement,

267
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:12,240
“万物皆数”
"Number is the within of all things"

268
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,640
在公元前六世纪
In the 6th century, B.C.

269
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,610
数字存在的历史有这么久吗？
Have numbers been around that long?

270
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:24,100
当然，数字的存在历史比人类久远
Of course Numbers existed before humans,

271
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:27,830
不，甚至，久远很多，很多
no, even much, much longer

272
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:31,860
甚至早在世界存在之前，它们就已经存在
They existed even before this world was born

273
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,040
但是人类创造了数字，是吗？
But humans invented numbers, right?

274
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:40,040
绝对不是，没有任何人目睹了数字的诞生
Not at all. No human being witnessed the birth of numbers

275
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:44,310
它们一直在那，从始至终
They have always just been there, all along

276
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:49,990
人类所能做的
All humans can do is express with words,

277
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,680
就是用文字表达出数字告诉我们的一切
what numbers provide for us

278
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,990
你们有什么看法？
What do you think?

279
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,850
关注发现更多的亲和数？
Care to discover some more amicable numbers?

280
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:07,130
顺便提一下，接下来最小的一对亲和数是
By the way, the next smallest amicable numbers are

281
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,240
和1210
1184 and

282
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,510
四个阿拉伯数字！
Four digits!

283
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,470
不可能！
No way!

284
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,380
这一对…
This pair...

285
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:25,320
在一八六六年…
In 1866...

286
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,450
意大利人，帕格尼尼
Paganini, an Italian,

287
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,990
尼科洛・帕格尼尼，发现了这一对
Nicolo Paganini, discovered this pair

288
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,370
你相信吗，那时候，帕格尼尼只有十六岁
Can you believe it, at the time, Paganni was 16 years old

289
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,840
在读高中！
In high school!

290
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:49,740
重要的是努力思考，不要放弃
What matters is to think it through without giving up

291
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:53,980
你不是“巨人迷”，我很高兴
I'm so glad you're not a Giants fan

292
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,260
是“老虎迷”
Always been a Tigers fan

293
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,860
我和我儿子也是大“老虎迷”
My son and I are huge Tigers fans, too

294
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,260
你有个儿子？
You have a son?

295
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,420
对
Yes

296
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,360
他有多大了？
How old is he?

297
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,890
十岁
Ten years old

298
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,400
十？
Ten?

299
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:18,770
为什么，他只是个孩子
Why, he's just a boy

300
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,580
你儿子现在在哪，做什么？
And where is your son now, what's he doing?

301
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,720
哦，我不确定
Oh, I'm not sure

302
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,390
可能在跟朋友们一起玩
Probably playing ball with his friends

303
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,450
“哦，我不确定”
"Oh, I'm not sure"

304
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,770
你应该多关心他
You should be more concerned

305
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,260
马上就要天黑了
It's going to get dark, soon

306
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:46,340
不要担心，他有每天的固定安排
Don't worry, he has a daily routine

307
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,000
固定安排？
Routine?

308
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,910
你每天都抛弃你的儿子
You routinely abandon your son

309
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,610
来这里做碎肉饼？
to make hamburgers here?

310
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,410
我不是抛弃他
I don't abandon him

311
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,780
只是，这是我的工作…
It's just that this is my job...

312
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,880
你不在的时候谁照顾他？
Who looks after him while you're away?

313
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,450
你丈夫很早回家？
Your husband comes home early?

314
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,390
哦…
Oh...

315
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,430
我明白了
I get it

316
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,630
他有个奶奶
He has a grandmother

317
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,370
不，不幸的是
No, unfortunately,

318
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,800
他没有爸爸，也没有奶奶
he has no father or grandmother

319
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,850
就只有我跟儿子两个人
My son and I live alone together

320
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:31,250
你儿子一个人在等你？
Does your son wait for you alone?

321
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,680
在饿着肚子等你？
He waits for you with an empty stomach?

322
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:41,960
这时候他妈妈在给一个陌生人做晚饭…
While his mother cooks supper for a stranger...

323
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,800
我的晚饭…
My supper...

324
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,500
这很糟糕
This is awful

325
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:55,730
不可以这样，不可以
This can't be, it can't

326
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,870
你不需要担心
You don't need to worry

327
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,850
一直以来就只有我们两个
It's always been just the two of us

328
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,150
他现在十岁了，一个人没事的
He's 10 now, he's fine on his own

329
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,290
他知道这里的电话号码
He knows the phone number here

330
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,880
我们的房东也可以帮忙
Our landlord can always help

331
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:14,950
不不不，你不可以让孩子一个人
No, no, no You can't leave a child alone

332
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,200
如果炉灶掉下来起火了怎么办？
What if the stove falls over and there's a fire?

333
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,520
如果糖果卡住了喉咙，谁来救他？
Who will save him if a candy gets stuck in throat?

334
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,570
想想就觉得可怕
It's terrifying to consider

335
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,740
我受不了，你现在必须回家
I can't bear it You must go home, now

336
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,830
就是现在，回家
Right now, go home

337
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:36,880
不会很久的，我要做好碎肉夹饼
I won't be much longer I just have to cook the burgers

338
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,680
不要管这个
Forget about that

339
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:43,050
如果做夹饼的时候，你儿子被火烧死了怎么办？
What if your son dies in a fire while you're cooking the burgers!

340
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,450
让我…
Just let me...

341
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,630
现在，听着
Now, listen

342
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,240
从明天开始，你把你儿子带过来
Starting tomorrow, just bring your son with you

343
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,240
让他放学后来这里
Just have him come here, right after school

344
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:11,470
你在这做饭，我们三个一起吃
You'll cook supper here and the three of us will eat together

345
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,880
但是，这…
But that's...

346
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,380
一个成年人怎么可以
How dare a grown man

347
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:20,150
当着一个饥饿的小孩的面只顾自己填饱肚子？
stuff his face in front a hungry child

348
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,060
但是我的合同…
But my contract...

349
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,790
但是，如果你不在这给他做饭，等你回去的时候
But if you don't cook him supper, until you get home from work,

350
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:36,640
你儿子八点才能吃到东西
your son can't eat until after 8PM

351
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,180
那样不对
That's not right

352
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,810
不要看轻我，不要
Don't underestimate me, assuming

353
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,950
我明天会忘记
I'll have forgotten by tomorrow

354
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,790
我什么都会忘记
I'll have none of that I won't forget

355
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:11,540
她的儿子
Her son

356
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:16,210
十岁
10 years old

357
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:25,820
如果你背弃承诺，我不会原谅你
If you break our promise, I won't forgive you

358
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,020
你好！
Hello!

359
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:36,620
你从很远的地方过来，好孩子，好孩子
You've come a long way Good boy, good boy

360
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:39,220
谢谢你，谢谢你
Thank you, thank you

361
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,270
我看得出来你有个聪明脑袋
I can tell you've got a wise heart in there

362
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,230
好了，你是阿根
All right, you're a Root

363
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:54,870
你接受任何数字，一个也不拒绝
You accept any number that comes your way, rejecting none

364
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:58,650
是真正慷慨的符号，阿根
A truly generous symbol, Root

365
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,620
过来
Come on in

366
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:05,320
从那天开始，我被叫做阿根
Ever since that day, I've been called Root

367
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,590
我的头…
My head...

368
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,600
像这个根号一样平
was as flat as this root symbol

369
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,770
我记得很清楚，博士跟我一起探寻
I remember well, the day the professor and I tried to find out,

370
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:23,210
会发生什么奇迹
what kind of magic happens,

371
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,940
你将数字放在根号里面
when you put numbers inside this root symbol

372
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,480
1的平方根
The square root of 1

373
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,580
1的根…
The root of 1...

374
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,520
有“+1”和“-1”，两个
There's +1 and -1, two of them

375
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:41,960
“-1”的平方根
The square root of -1

376
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:46,620
“-1”的平方根…
The square root of -1...

377
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,570
是“+1”还是“-1”？
Is this +1 or -1?

378
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,440
不可能
Impossible

379
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,830
为什么？
Why?

380
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,880
因为“+1”和“-1”的平方根
Because the square roots of +1 and -1,

381
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,380
都是“+1”
are both +1

382
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,520
很对
Exactly

383
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,590
好，那么“-1”的平方根
AlI right, so the square root of -1,

384
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:14,320
究竟是什么？
what exactly is it?

385
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:22,200
没有这样的数字
There is no such number

386
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:26,940
不，它就在这里
No, it's right here

387
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,100
为了回答这个问题
To answer this,

388
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,970
意大利数学家，拉斐罗・邦别利…
the Italian mathematician, Rafael Bombelli...

389
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:37,770
拉斐罗・邦别利
Rafael Bombelli,

390
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:42,680
发明了一个新数字，“i”
invented a new number, "i"

391
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,120
那是在十六世纪，“i”
This was in the 16th century, "i"

392
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:51,190
“i”是一个虚数
"i" s an imaginary number

393
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:01,330
因为它是一个很谦虚的数字…
Because it's a very modest number...

394
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,210
所以用了“谦虚”的“虚”字
It's written with the character for "candor,"

395
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,470
而且…
and...

396
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,950
谦卑的性格
the character for humility

397
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:17,510
从来没有出现在可见的世界
It never appears in the visible world,

398
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,690
但总是存在于我们心里
but it's always inside our hearts,

399
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,560
用它短小的臂膀
using its short little arms

400
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,960
支撑起它的整个世界
to support its whole world

401
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:34,040
从“i”你可以想到什么？
What do you magine from this "i"?

402
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:38,070
想象一下看
Just try to imagine

403
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,110
“Iloveyou！”我爱你里面的“I”
The "I" in "I love you!"

404
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:49,580
对，那个“I”
That's right, that "I"

405
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:52,090
但是那个“I”
But that "I" naturally

406
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:58,400
通向“爱”
leads to "love"

407
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,680
打搅一下…我可以做什么吗？
Excuse me... May I help you?

408
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,790
我喜欢看着你做饭
I like watching you cook

409
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,500
为什么你一定要…
Why do you have to...

410
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,540
不停地翻动肉片呢？
keep moving the meat around?

411
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,240
因为锅子中间到边缘的温度不一样
The temperature varies from the center to the sides of the pan

412
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:47,540
为了让菜受热均匀，要变动它们的位置
To cook things evenly, you have to shift them around

413
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,910
我明白了
I see

414
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,550
它们分享每一个点
They all share every spot, so that one can't

415
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,320
那么就没有谁一直霸占最好的点
monopolize the best spot

416
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,820
什么事情…这么迷人？
What is... so fascinating?

417
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,000
我只是在做饭
I'm just cooking

418
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:16,040
哦，如此平和
Oh, it's so peaceful

419
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,840
阿根很快就回来了
Root will be back, soon

420
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,240
阿根？
Root?

421
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,380
他是我十岁的儿子
He's my 10 year old son

422
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:30,860
他有个方脑袋，所以叫阿根
He has a flat head, so he's Root

423
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:36,180
哦，我明白了，你有个儿子
Oh, I see, you have a son?

424
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,520
对
Yes

425
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,530
我回来了！
I'm home!

426
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,100
看，阿根来了
See, here's Root

427
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,070
有什么比听到孩子喊“我回来了”更暖人心房呢？
What's more heartwarming than a child calling, "I'm home"

428
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,780
真是个好孩子
That's a good boy

429
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,950
我看得出来你有个聪明脑袋
I can tell you've got a wise heart in there

430
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:06,620
洗手，然后我们吃饭
Wash your hands and let's eat

431
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:15,060
你能吃多少就吃多少，小孩的任务就是长大
You've got to eat all you can A child's job is to grow

432
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:19,430
不能因为不爱吃就不吃
And don't eave anything just because you don't like it

433
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:22,500
如果你还饿
And if you're still hungry,

434
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:26,570
就帮我吃一些
just help yourself to some of m ne

435
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,040
好，谢谢！
Sure, thanks!

436
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:20,890
每一次我看到孩子们开心地玩耍
Every time I see children happily playing,

437
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,900
一首诗就浮现在我的脑海
an old poem comes to mind

438
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,670
“看别人的小孩嬉戏”
"To see others' children frolic

439
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,670
“泪水止不住，为了我那失去的孩儿”
"brings ceaseless tears for my own, now lost"

440
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:37,580
我的心…
My heart is....

441
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,810
是e
(pi).i th power of e =-1

442
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:48,120
就像这个方程式永远等于-1
Just as this equation will forever yield -1,

443
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:54,190
我们的新生活永远都丢失了
the new life we made is now lost forever

444
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,940
对于我们，开始步出生命的轨迹
To us, having stepped off course,

445
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,400
没有人施以援手
none will offer a friendly hand

446
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,440
来分担你的不幸
To share in your misfortune

447
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:10,410
这是我唯一的愿望
That is my only wish

448
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,580
致我心爱的N
To my beloved N

449
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,310
可以帮我个忙吗？
Can I ask you a favor?

450
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,950
我能帮一定帮
If I can be of help, sure

451
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:48,950
考考我吧
Try me out

452
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:50,990
你会修收音机吗？
Can you fix the radio?

453
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,990
修收音机？
Fix the radio?

454
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:54,120
对
Yeah

455
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:58,660
我来这里就没法关注棒球比赛了
When I come here, I can't follow the baseball games

456
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:02,930
这里没电视机，收音机又坏了
There's no TV, the radio's busted

457
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:07,100
职业棒球队里…
Oh... professional baseball

458
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:10,510
你支持哪个队？
Which team are you for?

459
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,680
你没看到我的帽子吗？老虎队
Can't you see from my cap? The Tigers

460
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,140
对，老虎队
Oh, right, the Tigers

461
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,580
对，老虎队
Oh, right, the Tigers

462
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:26,760
我是江夏的球迷
I'm an Enatsu fan

463
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:29,720
江夏是老虎队的王牌投手
The Tiger's ace pitcher, Enatsu

464
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:33,120
是啊！太好了
Really! Oh, great

465
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,560
那你一定要修好收音机了
Then you have to fix the radio

466
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,760
现在江夏的投手责任得分率是多少？
What's Enatsu's Earned Run Average now?

467
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,470
他有几个三振出局？
How about his Strikeouts?

468
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,810
他们把江夏卖掉了
They traded Enatsu away

469
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,210
还有，他已经退役了
Besides, he's already retired

470
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:55,480
退役了？
Ret red?

471
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:29,540
晚安
Good night

472
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,930
老虎队今晚有比赛吗？
Are the Tigers playing tonight?

473
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:45,690
希望他们能赢
I hope they're winning

474
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,270
我应该闭嘴的
I should've kept my mouth shut

475
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:54,510
我不知道博士是江夏迷
I had no idea the professor was such an Enatsu fan

476
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:59,350
不管怎样，我们不希望他难过
No matter the reason, we don't want him to suffer

477
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:00,580
当然了
Of course not

478
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:07,420
博士不断重复自己的话
The professor repeats himself constantly

479
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,590
我们说好了
Let's promise

480
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:13,790
我们永远不要说“你已经告诉过我了”
We'll never say, "You already told me that"

481
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:16,930
好的，我一定不说
Sure, I promise

482
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:21,930
别担心，明天他又会恢复原状了
Don't worry, tomorrow he'll be back the way he was

483
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:27,040
在博士记忆里，江夏永远是老虎队的王牌
In the professor's mind, Enatsu will be the Tiger's ace all over again

484
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:45,060
今天天气真好
It's such a glorious day out

485
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,590
你愿意去公园散步吗？
Would you like to take a stroll in the park?

486
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:58,870
有什么好处呢？
What would be the point?

487
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,000
散步促进血液循环
Walking improves your circulation,

488
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,950
这样你就会有更好的数学灵感了
so you might get some good math ideas

489
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,980
腿部和大脑…
Blood circulates differently

490
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:12,990
血液循环是不同的
to the legs and the brain

491
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:32,580
我跟你在一起
Now listen, I'm with you here

492
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,340
你不会一个人回家吧
Don't you just go home alone

493
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:37,640
当然不会，别担心
Sure, don't worry

494
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,700
种田和研究数学很相近
Farming is the work most similar to mathematics

495
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:11,050
种田？
Farming?

496
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,410
没错
That's right

497
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,690
你选择种子，耕耘土地
You select and plough the land,

498
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,520
种下并培育种子
plant and grow your seeds

499
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:24,250
数学家选择他们的研究领域
Mathematicians choose their field,

500
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:29,060
种下他们的种子并努力培育它们
plant their seeds and work hard cultivating them

501
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:33,760
种子就会长大了
The seeds themselves do all the growing

502
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,080
什么都可以吃
Anything's edible

503
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,350
看见了吗？
Do you see?

504
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:54,790
蔬菜并不只在商店能买到
Vegetables aren't just things you buy in a store

505
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,730
为什么，那是野草
Why, that's a weed

506
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,570
这是土壤的气味，很好闻
It's scent of the earth, good smell

507
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:17,380
用芥末酱拌着吃会长力气
Toss it with some mustard sauce for strength

508
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:23,250
回去的时候到了，阿根要回家了
I say it's time to head back Time for Root to come home

509
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,810
阿根？
Root?

510
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,750
阿根是我的儿子
Root is my son

511
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:30,220
你有个儿子？
You have a son?

512
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:31,350
是的！
Yes!

513
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,730
那我们赶快回家，没时间摘野草了
Let's hurry home then, hardly the time for picking weeds

514
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:03,920
听着，每个难题都有其韵律
Listen, now Every problem has its rhythm

515
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,490
如果你把难题大声读出来，并且抓住它的韵律
If you say the problem out loud and grasp its rhythm,

516
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,060
你就能完全沉浸其中
you can contemplate it in its entirety

517
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:16,300
你就会开始猜测哪些地方暗藏陷阱
and you'll begin to surmise the suspicious areas where traps lurk

518
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:22,740
买两块手帕和两双袜子，需三百八十元
"I bought 2 handkerchiefs and 2 pairs of socks for 380 yen

519
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:26,640
买同样的两块手帕和五双袜子
"The same 2 handkerchiefs and 5 pairs of socks,

520
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,780
需七百一十元
"cost 710 yen"

521
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:34,160
“求每件商品的价格”
"How much did each item cost?"

522
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:38,790
没错，这题可能是…
It's true, this may be

523
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,200
你今天碰到最难的问题
your toughest problem today

524
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,960
不过你读得这么好听
But you read it out loud so beautifully

525
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,870
手帕，袜子，价格
Handkerchiefs, socks, cost

526
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:51,540
手帕，袜子，价格
Handkerchiefs, socks, cost

527
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:55,480
你完全掌握了韵律
You had the rhythm down perfectly

528
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:59,410
枯燥的作业…
A boring assignment,

529
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:02,220
读起来像一首诗
read like a complete verse

530
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:08,580
好，让我们把题画出来
All right, let's try making a drawing of it

531
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,630
过来
Come over here

532
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,490
准备好了吗？
Ready?

533
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:23,030
先画两块手帕
First the 2 handkerchiefs

534
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:29,950
再画两双袜子
Then the 2 pairs of socks

535
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:35,050
这不像袜子，像是肥毛虫
Those don't look like socks, they look like fat caterpillars

536
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:37,890
我画给你看
I'I draw them for you

537
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,280
每次…
In every situation,

538
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:44,220
博士都不会直接给出正确答案
the professor wasn't just after the right answer

539
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,330
博士宁可…
The professor preferred...

540
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:51,860
费尽心机想办法打破我因为答不出来…
the bizarre mistakes born of trying too hard, to my falling silent,

541
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:53,730
而保持的沉默
for lack of an answer

542
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:58,900
不管我显得有多愚蠢
No matter what stupid dead end I wound up in,

543
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,210
博士总是能替我找到积极面，并为我骄傲
the professor always found something positive for me to be proud of

544
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:08,080
你做对了，对！
You're right, right!

545
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:10,790
教我棒球好吗？
Teach me baseball, OK?

546
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:12,620
棒球…
Baseball...

547
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:15,690
你中学时打过棒球，对吗？
You played baseball in high school, right?

548
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,760
是的，我热爱棒球
Yes, I loved baseball

549
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,170
我读大一的时候，打进过我们那里的半决赛
In our junior year, we lost the Prefecturals in the semi-finals

550
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:30,030
请你指导我们练习好吗？
Will you coach our practices? Please

551
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,840
好吧
Sure, all right

552
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,380
好吧
All right

553
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:41,680
棒球…
Baseball...

554
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:48,990
练习
Practice

555
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,460
对不起…
Excuse me...

556
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:59,490
我能告诉你我的发现吗？
May I tell you what I discovered?

557
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,230
把28的约数加起来…
If you add up 28's divisors,

558
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:09,600
就等于28
you get 28

559
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:11,750
嗯…
Hmm...

560
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:29,170
这是完全数
That's a perfect number

561
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:31,170
完全数…
A perfect number...

562
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:35,240
最小的完全数…
The smallest perfect number...

563
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:37,500
是6
is 6

564
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:44,040
对啊，这没什么大不了的
You're right, it's no big deal

565
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:45,710
不，这很了不起
Oh, yes it is

566
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:49,920
他们是表达完美内含的珍贵数字
They're precious numbers which embody the meaning of perfection

567
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,820
笛卡尔说过
Descartes said,

568
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:57,530
就像完美的人是罕有的一样
"just as perfect humans are rare,

569
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:01,090
完全数也是很罕有的
"so are perfect numbers"

570
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:05,390
几千年来…
Over the past several thousand years,

571
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:07,530
只发现了三十个完全数
barely 30 have been found

572
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,200
只有三十个？
Only 30 of them?

573
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:12,740
对，完全数28
Yes, the perfect number 28

574
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:17,310
也是江夏的号码，老虎队的王牌投手
is also Enatsu's number, the Tiger's ace pitcher

575
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:21,680
在我脑海中
Inside my head,

576
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,250
我能回忆起他比赛的每个细节
I can recall every detail of his games,

577
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:29,620
从一九六七年他凭借十个三振出局…
from his first professional win with the Carps in 1967,

578
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,460
第一次赢得佳能杯，到一九七三年八月三十日…
with 10 Strikeouts, to a game on August 30th, 1973,

579
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:37,660
那天他在加时赛里…
when he hit that game-ending home run

580
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:41,000
打出了终赛全垒打
in a no-hit, no-run, extra-innings game

581
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:45,370
我给你们看完全数的另一个特点
Let me show you one more feature of perfect numbers

582
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,000
完全数…
Perfect numbers,

583
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:51,170
可以表示成相邻数的加总
can be expressed as a sum of consecutive whole numbers

584
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:55,910
1 + 2 + …，
Here goes 1 plus 2 plus

585
00:54:56,020 --> 00:55:00,080
3 + 4 + …，
3 plus 4 plus

586
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:03,920
5 + 6 +…，
5 plus 6 plus

587
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,430
哇，二十八
Wow, 28

588
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:11,020
对，二十八
Right! 28

589
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,140
瞧，二十八
See, 28

590
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:18,670
直到今天，完全数还是个谜
To this day, perfect numbers are shrouded in mystery

591
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:22,340
还没有人证明出…
No one has ever proven

592
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:25,280
一共存在着多少完全数
that an infinite number of perfect numbers exists

593
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:30,390
老师，他也教你棒球了吗？
Teacher, did he also teach you baseball?

594
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,620
是的
Of course

595
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:35,280
博士在大学读数学系的时候…
The professor had tried to pursue baseball

596
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:38,890
他还在打棒球，不过他的肩膀受了伤
as a college math major, but he injured his shoulder

597
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,430
他就放弃了
He gave it up

598
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,090
他的肩膀受了伤…
He injured his shoulder,

599
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,670
但他年轻时候的经验和技巧
but his experience and the practice

600
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:49,100
是实实在在的
he'd put in as a young man were the real thing

601
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:50,540
游击手
Shortstop

602
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,750
二垒
Second base

603
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,350
对了
That's right

604
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:08,650
对，打得好
Right, here goes

605
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,550
越快越好
As fast as you can

606
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,670
打出了圆滚线
That's the Cycloid Curve

607
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:17,760
对
Right

608
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:24,240
博士怀着巨大的热情…
The professor repeated the basics over and over again,

609
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:27,740
一遍一遍地教我们基础训练
teaching us baseball with a great deal of love

610
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:32,540
我和我的队友商量好…
My teammates and I promised that no matter how many times

611
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:37,710
不管他教了我们几遍同样的东西，我们都不说“你已经教过了”
he taught us the same thing, we'd never say, ''You already taught us that"

612
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:04,040
致我永远的爱人N…
"To my eternally beloved N...

613
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:08,470
“你永远不会忘记的人上”
"From the one you must never forget"

614
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:49,820
这是个高飞球，快击中它
That's a high fly, call the bal

615
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:54,210
你没有击中，起来吧！
You didn't call the ball Get up!

616
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:58,160
你没事吧？别动
Are you OK? Don't move

617
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:59,160
救护车！
An ambulance!

618
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:02,170
救护车？他不动就没事了
Ambulance? He'll be fine if he doesn't move

619
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:03,760
快叫救护车
Call an ambulance now

620
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:14,880
如果我不打出那个高飞球
If I hadn't hit that fly ball

621
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:18,970
都是我的错
It's my fault

622
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:22,450
这是常有的事
It happens all the time

623
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:14,930
给
Here

624
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:19,500
在纸上画一条直线
Try drawing a straight line here

625
01:00:20,310 --> 01:00:22,110
这会让你平静下来
lt'll calm you down

626
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:26,240
来吧
Go ahead

627
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:50,900
对，这是一条直线
That's right, that's a line

628
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:58,240
但你想想看
But think about it

629
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:04,250
你画的这条直线有头有尾
The line you drew has a beginning and an end

630
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:07,350
这就意味着…
Which means,

631
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:12,090
你画的线是一段…
you've drawn a line segment linking the shortest distance

632
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,520
两点间的距离
between two points

633
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,700
直线的定义是没有尽头的
The definition of a line doesn't include ends

634
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:25,140
应该是没有界限的
It's supposed to continue indefinitely

635
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:31,070
但一张纸是有边界的
But there are limits to a piece of paper

636
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:34,380
因为能力有限…
as there are to your strength

637
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:36,980
我们只能…
So we agree to calI what's

638
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:41,350
把线段称为直线
really a line segment, a line

639
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,860
真正的直线在哪？
Where can a true line be found?

640
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:50,360
只有…
Only...

641
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:54,500
在这里
in here

642
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:03,200
永恒的事实是看不见的，是不会因为…
The eternal truth is invisible and unswayed by matter,

643
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:08,120
事件，自然现象或是情绪而动摇的
natural phenomenon or emotions

644
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,950
那个看不见的世界…
The invisible world

645
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,960
支撑着看得见的世界
supports the visible world

646
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:24,360
最重要的东西我们在心中才能找到
The important things, we have to see with our hearts

647
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:40,410
你不必担心
You don't have to worry

648
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:44,280
根的含义是坚强
The root symbol is sturdy

649
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:47,750
它保护每个数字
It protects every number

650
01:02:57,470 --> 01:02:59,490
你好吗？
Hey! How are you?

651
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,370
真不负责任
How irresponsible

652
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:05,140
你怎么能把他留给博士管！
How could you leave him in the professor's care!

653
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:09,610
他真的没事？
Is he really all right?

654
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:12,210
是的，他对他处理得当
Yes, he treated him appropriately

655
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,250
他没做错什么？
He did nothing wrong?

656
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:17,910
无懈可击…
A little more than necessary...

657
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:46,350
瞧
Look

658
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,830
第一颗亮起来的星星
There's the first star, up there

659
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:55,890
对不起，我在医院说错了话
I'm sorry. What I said at the hospital was wrong

660
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,230
我…
I won't...

661
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:05,200
永远忘不了博士悲伤的脸…
ever forget the professor's sad face...

662
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:09,000
永远
Ever

663
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:17,250
我一度不相信博士…
That I doubted the professor, even for a moment,

664
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:21,290
我很惭愧
is something I'm ashamed of

665
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:23,750
我道歉
I apologize

666
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:28,460
好吧，我接受了
OK, I accept

667
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:31,930
我们拉钩
Let's make-up

668
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:43,440
他说他会来看我们下次的比赛
He said he'd come to our next game

669
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:46,910
你知道博士不能作不了承诺吧？
You know the professor can't make promises, don't you?

670
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:49,380
我会问他
I'll ask him

671
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:54,090
只要他记得…
If only he could get to know

672
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:56,660
我的队友…
each of my teammates...

673
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:05,400
队服号码怎么样…
What about un form numbers...

674
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,630
我知道了…号码！
I know... numbers!

675
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:10,970
一切都交给我吧
Leave everything to me

676
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,060
好的！
Sure!

677
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:26,080
这片叶子也是1
So this leaf is 1, too

678
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:27,510
对
Right

679
01:06:28,830 --> 01:06:31,990
那是一片叶子
That's one leaf

680
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:38,860
那棵雪松有那么多叶子…
And that cedar tree with so many leaves

681
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,500
也是一棵树
is one tree, too

682
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:44,230
一棵树只能算是1，真有趣
It's funny each only counts as one

683
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,610
事实上…
It truly is

684
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:52,180
定义“1”是很有挑战性的事
Defining "one" is quite a challenge

685
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:56,520
对你来说也是吗？
Even for you?

686
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,890
很多事我不了解
So many things I don't know

687
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:02,220
我们来看看
Let me see

688
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:06,030
好了吗？
Ready?

689
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:08,860
告诉我…
Tell me,

690
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:12,670
你现在怎么称呼这个？
what do you call this now?

691
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:16,970
它像灰尘了，不再是一片叶子
It's like dust, it's not a leaf anymore

692
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:19,570
没错
That's right

693
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:29,520
只有完整的时候，它才是一片叶子
It's only a leaf when it's whole

694
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:35,450
对你来说也是，阿根
It's true of you, Root

695
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:40,060
和谐的整体是美妙的
The harmony of the whole in an individual is beautiful

696
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:43,530
这就意味着好
That's what it means to be good

697
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:00,940
听听
Listen

698
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:04,910
加时赛取得了胜利…
The walk-off victory The no-hit, no-run game...

699
01:09:49,090 --> 01:09:50,890
七百一十四是…
714 was

700
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,830
贝贝・鲁斯到一九三五年为止本垒打的纪录
Babe Ruth's 1935 career home run record

701
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:58,400
汉克・阿伦一九七四年八月八日打到道奇队的阿尔・丹宁…
Hank Aaron hit his career total of 715 home runs

702
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:03,440
投的球，打出了他职业生涯中的第七百一十五个本垒打
on a pitch from the Dodger's Al Downing on April 8th, 1974

703
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:09,680
进场！
Here goes!

704
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:19,010
村田作为扎托派克队的投手…
Retired number 11

705
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,280
是穿十一号球衣退役的
is Murayama with the Zatopek pitch

706
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:25,220
二十三号是吉田
Number 23 is Yoshida

707
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:28,390
十号是藤村
Number 10 is Fujimura

708
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:31,530
有天渊，三宅…
There's Tabuchi, Miyake and...

709
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:34,870
我和教练为你准备的
The r coach and I did it for you

710
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:39,680
那个根号是谁？
What's the root symbol?

711
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:42,270
我的儿子
That's my son

712
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,740
你有个儿子？
You have a son?

713
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:46,310
对！
Yes!

714
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:54,620
根号会让他和其他队员成为好朋友
A root symbol will share his friendship fairly with any player

715
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:09,570
我没看见二十八号，那是王牌投手江夏的号码
I don't see #28, ace pitcher Enatsu's number

716
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:14,140
我们为你留了28这个完全数
We've saved the perfect number, 28, for you

717
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:18,570
开始！
Play ball!

718
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:30,820
加油！
Go!

719
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:32,620
阿根！
Root!

720
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:38,460
加油！加油！老虎队！
Go! Go! Tigers!

721
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:12,670
加油，阿根！
Go, go, Root!

722
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,230
按住
Hold this

723
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:31,280
你好吗？感觉如何？
How are you? How are you feeling?

724
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:33,570
告诉我你渴不渴
Tell me if you're thirsty

725
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:37,280
我不该坚持…
I shouldn't have insisted...

726
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:39,290
都是我的错
It's all my fault

727
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:44,950
别担心，不严重
Don't worry, it's not serious

728
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,630
你快睡觉吧
You go to bed, now

729
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:05,540
晚安
Good night

730
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:49,880
你不该起来的，你还有热度
You shouldn't be up You've still got a f ever

731
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:51,580
你得休息
You have to rest

732
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:56,780
脱掉衣服，换套内衣裤吧
Get out of your clothes, let's change your underwear

733
01:15:57,030 --> 01:15:59,050
你昨晚全身被汗水湿透了
You were drenched in sweat last night

734
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:02,530
我给你换床单，你会觉得舒服点
I'll change the sheets and you'll feel refreshed

735
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:06,390
为棒球比赛加油一定让你筋疲力竭了
Cheering at the bal game must have exhausted you

736
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:10,270
对不起，我们坚持要你去
I'm sorry we insisted on inviting you

737
01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:16,810
如果你穿得暖和，吃得好，会康复的
If you keep warm and eat well, you'll recover

738
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:19,470
阿根也是那样的
Root's that way, too

739
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:23,250
你该吃点东西了
We've got to get something into your stomach

740
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:25,980
我拿点苹果汁来好吗？
Shall I bring some apple juice?

741
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,530
我的记忆…
"My memory...

742
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:20,470
只能维持八十分钟
"lasts only 80 minutes"

743
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:28,870
我是你的管家
I am your housekeeper

744
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:34,150
我是受雇来帮你的管家
I'm the housekeeper, hired to help you

745
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:43,020
我是…
I am...

746
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,730
废人…
Useless...

747
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,240
你帮助我的儿子
You helped my son,

748
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:55,040
教会我许多宝贵的东西
and taught me something precious

749
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:03,410
永恒的事实是看不见的…
The eternal truth is invisible...

750
01:18:05,490 --> 01:18:07,460
一定要用心去看
You must see it with your heart

751
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:13,430
到傍晚，我儿子就回来了
At dusk, my son will join us

752
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:18,030
我们叫他阿根，因为他是平头
We call him Root, for his flat head

753
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:21,200
是你取的名字
You named him

754
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:37,420
你生日是哪天？
What is your birthday?

755
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:42,920
二月二十号
February 20th

756
01:18:50,670 --> 01:18:54,800
220常常和284有关系
220, eternally bound to

757
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:03,310
我以为…
I thought...

758
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:07,140
女人的手是冷的
women's hands were cold

759
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:10,980
暖和吗？
Are they warm?

760
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:23,660
这样才暖和
If only this warmth...

761
01:20:02,910 --> 01:20:04,200
对不起
Sorry

762
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:06,980
情况不妙
This is no good

763
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:08,530
有人投诉
A complaint

764
01:20:09,310 --> 01:20:10,570
什么？
What kind?

765
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,780
别假装你不知情
Don't pretend you don't know

766
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:16,550
你犯了大错
You've made a terrible mistake

767
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:21,450
我听说你在那个数学博士家里留宿了
I hear you stayed over at the math professor's house

768
01:20:22,490 --> 01:20:24,890
我没有犯错
I've made no mistake

769
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:28,360
你的粗俗暗示冒犯了我
I'm offended by your vulgar insinuation

770
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,400
你知道工作的规矩
You know the rules of your job

771
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,900
是的，很清楚
Yes, very well

772
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:43,600
未遵守规矩是我不对
I was wrong to ignore them

773
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:49,350
你坏了规矩，在一个男人的家里待了三个晚上
You break the rules, spend 3 nights in a man's house

774
01:20:49,450 --> 01:20:51,080
这也算是冒犯？
and are offended by insinuations?

775
01:20:51,550 --> 01:20:55,080
但我不能抛下病人
But I couldn't abandon an invalid

776
01:20:55,820 --> 01:21:00,120
我想我只是在履行职责
I be ieved I was only fulfilling my obvious duties

777
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:06,330
我已经特别优待你的儿子了
I fee I've been especially accommodating about your son

778
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,360
是特殊照顾
It's a special arrangement

779
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:12,100
我为我的儿子而感激
I'm grateful about my son

780
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:16,010
对您的照顾感激不尽
I can't thank you enough for your consideration

781
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:23,380
我的行为不够检点
I was careless in my actions

782
01:21:23,790 --> 01:21:25,340
我道歉
I apologize

783
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:30,220
我们给你重新安排
So... we'll reassign you

784
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:33,120
什么？请等一下
What? Please, wait a minute

785
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:42,040
这是博士的意思吗？
Is that the professor's wish?

786
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:43,560
是他嫂子的意思
His sister's

787
01:21:48,010 --> 01:21:53,350
我从没有麻烦到他嫂子
I never troubled his sister

788
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:58,420
我按照她的吩咐自己解决博士的问题
I fo lowed her orders and kept the professor's troubles to myself

789
01:21:58,990 --> 01:22:02,050
她不会管我怎样工作
She's not involved with how I do my job

790
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:04,760
她怎么能解雇我？
So, how can she fire me?

791
01:22:04,990 --> 01:22:08,560
她知道你留宿了
She knew that you'd been staying over

792
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:13,290
那她也一定知道他病了
Then surely she knew he was ill

793
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:18,400
而且他比别的病人更需要照顾
And that he required more care than most invalids

794
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:23,900
如果我今天不去，博士就会很…
If I don't go today, the professor will be very...

795
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:29,180
他就要一个人起床…
He's probably getting out of bed,

796
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:33,620
读他夹克衫上的字条了
reading the note on his jacket all alone...

797
01:22:36,190 --> 01:22:39,630
我想不出有谁能顶替你…
I can't imagine anyone who can replace you...

798
01:22:41,130 --> 01:22:42,650
但我别无选择
But I've no choice

799
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,200
这是最终决定
That's all, it's final

800
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:50,670
没得商量
No room for discussion

801
01:23:16,170 --> 01:23:20,070
1，2…
1... 2...

802
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:33,050
4的阶乘是24
The factorial of 4 is 24

803
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:37,740
真是尊贵的数字
My, what a noble number

804
01:23:38,050 --> 01:23:40,490
行了
Please, come on n

805
01:23:42,730 --> 01:23:47,060
我不时想起博士的话
Now and then, I remember the professor's words

806
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:51,430
数学规律优美而精确
The laws of mathematics are exquisite, precisely

807
01:23:51,830 --> 01:23:54,300
因为他们在日常生活中是无用的
because they are useless in everyday life

808
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:59,430
即使找出了所有质数…
Even if the characteristics of prime numbers were determined,

809
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:04,500
也不能改善生活，没人会因此变得富有
life wouldn't improve and no one would get rich

810
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:09,080
当然，不管有多背离世界…
Of course, no matter how you turn your back on the world,

811
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:14,920
很多数学发现都有实际应用
many mathematical discoveries have found practical applications

812
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:21,030
质数甚至以作密码的形式卷入了战争
Even prime numbers collude in warfare, in the form of secret codes

813
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:23,630
这是丑恶的一面
It's an ugly fact

814
01:24:25,030 --> 01:24:28,970
但那不是数学的目的
But that is not the purpose of mathematics

815
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:33,530
数学的唯一目的是探知真理
lts only purpose is to ascertain truth

816
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:39,640
鼓起勇气睁开你的慧眼
Open your wise eyes with courage

817
01:24:56,900 --> 01:25:00,360
对不起我迟到了
I'm sorry I'm late

818
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:07,540
欢迎光临
Welcome

819
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,870
咖啡，谢谢
Coffee, please

820
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:16,620
我们为什么不再去看博士了
Why don't we visit the professor anymore?

821
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:23,880
事情变了
Things changed

822
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:26,330
什么事？
What things?

823
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:32,260
复杂的事
Complicated things

824
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:39,460
他们说在找人接替你的工作
They say looking after someone, makes them your responsibility

825
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:42,240
你！
You!

826
01:25:44,150 --> 01:25:46,840
我不担心，因为你那么漂亮
I'm not worried, because you're beautiful

827
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:52,550
真的？妈妈漂亮吗？
Is that so? Mom's beautiful?

828
01:25:52,990 --> 01:25:56,150
没错，你觉得呢？
That's right, didn't you realize?

829
01:25:57,390 --> 01:26:00,990
因为你漂亮，所以不由担心
That's why it's fine Because you're beautiful

830
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,570
好了
Done

831
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:49,000
2311，我宣布你是一个质数
Serial number 2311... I pronounce you a prime number

832
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,550
管家，你的电话
Housekeeper, a call for you

833
01:26:58,650 --> 01:26:59,710
来了
Yes

834
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:39,720
麻烦你真对不起，我知道你很忙
I'm sorry to trouble you, I know you're busy

835
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:42,790
请坐
Please, sit down

836
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:47,030
给客人上茶
Some tea for our guest

837
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:48,100
是
Yes

838
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:10,020
你究竟在想什么？
What exactly are you thinking?

839
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:13,020
我儿子做错了什么？
Has my son done something wrong?

840
01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:15,120
问题不在于此
That's not the issue

841
01:28:15,530 --> 01:28:17,930
我把你解雇后……
What do you mean by sending

842
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,060
你还把你儿子送到我小叔子这里…
your son to my brother-in-law's,

843
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:24,230
你是什么意思？
even after I fired you?

844
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:26,140
我是什么意思？
What do I mean?

845
01:28:27,180 --> 01:28:29,230
他只有十岁
He's a 10 year old child

846
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:32,880
他来玩是因为他想来，这还不够吗？
He came to play because he wanted to Isn't that good enough?

847
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:35,980
对，我知道孩子是无辜的
Yes, I'm sure the child is innocent

848
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:41,090
我在问你的原因
I'm asking about your reasons

849
01:28:44,630 --> 01:28:45,850
我…
All...

850
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:52,160
我只想我的儿子幸福
All I want is for my son to be happy

851
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:59,330
带他和你儿子一起出去，在这里留宿看护他…
Taking him out with your son, staying over to nurse him...

852
01:29:00,110 --> 01:29:04,410
我想不起来吩咐过你那样做
I don't recall telling you to do such things

853
01:29:04,850 --> 01:29:07,280
我承认我超越了职责范围
I acknowledge that I overstepped my duties

854
01:29:10,490 --> 01:29:15,420
但这不是别有用心的
But it was not intentional or calculating

855
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,990
原因很简单
It was simpler

856
01:29:19,230 --> 01:29:20,890
是为了钱？
Is it money?

857
01:29:21,730 --> 01:29:23,100
钱？
Money?

858
01:29:23,570 --> 01:29:26,730
你怎么能这样说？
How... can you say that?

859
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:33,200
你跟我们别再有任何瓜葛
You're no longer involved with us

860
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:37,900
我下班时间到了，我回家了
My time's up, I'm going home

861
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,960
因为我们是朋友
It's because we're friends

862
01:29:50,590 --> 01:29:54,120
来和朋友玩也有错吗？
What's wrong with coming to play with a friend?

863
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,290
我的小叔子没有朋友
My brother-in-law has no friends

864
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:01,900
从来没朋友来看过他
No friend has ever visited him

865
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,570
那我和阿根是他的第一个朋友
Then Root and I are his first friends

866
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:12,140
我的小叔子每天都会忘记你们
My brother doesn't remember you for even a single day

867
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:18,350
虽然他这一辈子都会记得我
Although he'll remember me his whole life

868
01:30:28,030 --> 01:30:30,160
对我和阿根来说
For Root and me,

869
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:33,530
跟博士在一起的时间
the time we spent with the professor

870
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:37,900
十分珍贵
was really precious

871
01:30:39,170 --> 01:30:43,670
即使只有八十分钟的记忆
Even f his 80 minute memory,

872
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:45,470
那也没关系
was none at all

873
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:51,390
直线…
A line...

874
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,320
就像一条直线
Just like a line

875
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:57,190
一个看不见的永恒的事实
An invisible eternal truth

876
01:30:57,390 --> 01:30:58,760
没错
That's right

877
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:03,020
如果你用心去看待事情，时光的长短并不重要
If you see things with your heart, time doesn't matter

878
01:31:03,730 --> 01:31:08,260
重要的是现在
What matters is right now

879
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:14,300
我只想表达阿根的真实想法…
I just wanted to express Root's real feelings...

880
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:28,480
不
No

881
01:31:30,290 --> 01:31:32,060
你不能折磨孩子
You can't torment a child

882
01:31:34,330 --> 01:31:36,260
孩子要面对…
ChiIdren struggle

883
01:31:36,770 --> 01:31:40,030
比我们大得多的难题
with much larger problems than ours

884
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:51,780
我也…
I, too...

885
01:32:03,530 --> 01:32:05,320
没什么…
have nothing...

886
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:11,330
可以失去的了
left to lose

887
01:32:14,770 --> 01:32:18,330
我只能如此
I can only accept what is, as it is

888
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:23,770
让一切…
Leaving everything

889
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:28,010
顺其自然吧
up to nature,

890
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:34,350
过好我生命中的每一刻
living every moment as best I can

891
01:34:37,550 --> 01:34:40,450
…是圆周率
(pi) is the circle ratio, right?

892
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:45,510
…是-1的平方根，这是个虚数
"I" is the square root of -1 and an imaginary number

893
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:51,580
这个数字，代表了无穷尽的宇宙
(pi), a number that continues to the ends of the universe,

894
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:56,520
还有虚数i，从来都不惹人注意
and the imaginary number "i" which never shows itself

895
01:34:57,100 --> 01:35:00,590
最会耍花样的，就是e
What's tricky is "e"

896
01:35:00,870 --> 01:35:05,330
e也叫做纳氏数字，是由英国的
"e" is also called the "Napier number," after John Napier,

897
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:08,530
数学家约翰・纳皮尔创造的
the British mathematician. The Napier number

898
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:14,750
纳氏数字是数学里面非常重要的常数
The Napier number is one of the constants, so critical to math

899
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:19,320
现在，我跟大家探讨结论
For now, I'll just tell you the conclusion

900
01:35:20,190 --> 01:35:24,990
按照运算法则，最后的值为…
If you calculate this "e," its value is...

901
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:35,530
e = 2.7182818284…！
e = 2.7182818284...

902
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,540
就比如…
This is just like ?

903
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:52,350
它在不停转啊转
It goes on and on and on forever

904
01:35:52,450 --> 01:35:53,850
这个数字似乎失去了理性
It's an irrational number

905
01:35:56,860 --> 01:35:59,380
像无限的宇宙
From an infinite universe,

906
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:01,560
圆周率
(pi)...

907
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:09,100
它来到e的身边
drifts down to "e"

908
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:15,640
它们握手了
And shakes hands

909
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:18,840
如果加上害羞的虚数i
with bashful "i"

910
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:23,840
他们就走在一起了
They come together,

911
01:36:23,950 --> 01:36:26,010
彼此一同呼吸
and hold their breaths

912
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:29,150
现在，它们之间没有联系
None of them are connected

913
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:33,650
但如果我们…
But, if a single human

914
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:38,960
加上一点东西
adds just one thing...

915
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:44,070
这个世界，就变样了
The world is transformed

916
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:50,380
矛盾得到了解决
The contradiction is resolved...

917
01:36:55,150 --> 01:36:56,380
答案是，0
Zero,

918
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:57,740
换句话说
in other words,

919
01:37:03,630 --> 01:37:05,990
它们所代表的，就是虚无的世界
the realm of nothingness embraces them

920
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:09,560
这个公式，是由瑞士数学家
This formula was conceived by the greatest

921
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:12,760
十八世纪的里奥纳多・欧拉创造的
18th century mathematician, Leonhard Euler

922
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,030
里奥纳多・欧拉
Leonhard Euler

923
01:37:17,570 --> 01:37:21,270
这就是欧拉的方程式
This is Euler's Equation

924
01:37:26,610 --> 01:37:31,420
他找到了数字之间的联系
He found a natural relationship between apparently unrelated numbers

925
01:37:32,450 --> 01:37:35,650
就比如
This is like...

926
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:40,360
黑暗中，陨落的星星
A star falling through the darkness

927
01:37:43,330 --> 01:37:47,460
这就是博士的方程式
This was the professor's beloved equation

928
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:53,570
在夜空中，孤独而美丽的星星
The beauty of a single star in the night sky,

929
01:37:55,010 --> 01:37:58,070
田野中独放的娇艳鲜花
the beauty of a single flower in a field

930
01:37:59,350 --> 01:38:03,280
难以言传
Just as these elude description,

931
01:38:03,620 --> 01:38:07,110
这方程式过于精妙
it's hard to explain the beauty of an equation

932
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:10,390
我对此还有许多不懂的地方
There's so much I don't know

933
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:13,690
但博士教导我
But the professor taught me,

934
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:17,260
要学会去感觉
how important it is to feel

935
01:38:17,930 --> 01:38:20,800
训练自己的直觉
Polish your intuition

936
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:23,870
培养出数学的敏感
and nurture generous feelings

937
01:38:25,410 --> 01:38:28,930
你们肯定感受到了这美感
I know you can experience this beauty

938
01:38:29,740 --> 01:38:33,310
请热爱数学吧
So please love mathematics

939
01:38:33,410 --> 01:38:35,470
和我一起努力
and work together with me

940
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:45,620
我妈妈回去为博士工作
My mother went back to work for the professor

941
01:39:12,350 --> 01:39:14,840
你好，我是女管家
Hello, I'm the housekeeper

942
01:39:25,170 --> 01:39:28,030
你穿多少码的鞋子？
What's your shoe size?

943
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,630
二十四码，四的阶乘
24, the factorial of 4

944
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:36,180
多么尊贵的数字啊
A truly noble number

945
01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:40,000
请进
Please, come on n

946
01:39:52,330 --> 01:39:56,350
这是《数学杂志》的来信，您赢得的大奖
A letter from the Journal of Math You won their competition

947
01:40:05,540 --> 01:40:09,100
这是杂志发行以来最高的现金奖励
It's the highest cash prize since they began publishing

948
01:40:12,750 --> 01:40:15,310
我一直记得
I'll always remember

949
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:18,750
那天我们初见
The day I first met you

950
01:40:19,690 --> 01:40:23,750
“你闯了进来，打搅了我去爱我的数字”
"You come barging in, interrupting my ove for my numbers!"

951
01:40:23,860 --> 01:40:25,260
“你还责备我了”
You scolded me

952
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:37,160
我们庆祝吧
Let's celebrate

953
01:40:39,670 --> 01:40:42,440
不需要费事啊
There's no need to celebrate

954
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:45,980
我们一起庆祝，快乐就会加倍
If we celebrate together, the joy will multiply

955
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:50,980
我不想庆祝啊
I don't want to celebrate

956
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:56,150
我所做的只不过偷看了上帝的笔记本
All I did was peep into God's notebook

957
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,120
然后，捏造了一些想法
and copy some deas

958
01:40:59,230 --> 01:41:01,420
不，我们要庆祝
No, we're celebrating

959
01:41:02,030 --> 01:41:03,960
阿根和我都希望这样
Root and I want to celebrate

960
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:06,690
阿根…
Root...

961
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,930
他是我儿子
My son

962
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:12,700
你有个儿子？
Oh, you have a son?

963
01:41:13,110 --> 01:41:14,070
是的
Yes

964
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:18,340
我们一起庆祝阿根的生日
I know, we'll celebrate Root's birthday, too

965
01:41:18,550 --> 01:41:20,610
就在五月十八日
It's May 18th

966
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:24,080
你来的话，他肯定很高兴的
He'll be thrilled if you're there

967
01:41:25,790 --> 01:41:28,050
他多大了？
How old will he be?

968
01:41:28,290 --> 01:41:29,850
十一岁了
Eleven

969
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:31,790
十一岁？
11?

970
01:41:31,890 --> 01:41:34,730
是的，要到十一岁了
Yes, he'll be 11

971
01:41:36,230 --> 01:41:38,290
多美妙的质数
A beautiful prime number

972
01:41:39,030 --> 01:41:42,400
特别的，美妙的质数
An especially beautiful prime

973
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:45,730
就像村田的比赛服上的数字
And it's Murayama's uniform number

974
01:41:46,410 --> 01:41:48,340
太美妙了
That's wonderful

975
01:41:48,980 --> 01:41:53,940
好吧，小孩子最喜欢庆祝活动了
All right, let's celebrate Children need celebrations

976
01:42:04,890 --> 01:42:07,920
五月十八日
May 18th

977
01:42:08,130 --> 01:42:13,070
阿根的生日
Root's birthday

978
01:46:47,070 --> 01:46:49,240
请坐
Please have a seat

979
01:46:58,590 --> 01:47:01,920
阿根，生日快乐
Root, happy birthday

980
01:47:02,060 --> 01:47:03,320
生日快乐
Happy birthday

981
01:47:05,690 --> 01:47:07,130
生日快乐
Happy birthday

982
01:47:13,030 --> 01:47:15,330
来吧，阿根
Here, Root

983
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:21,140
博士，这是给你的礼物
Here's your gift, Professor

984
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:23,040
给我的？
What? For me?

985
01:47:30,420 --> 01:47:31,980
这是…
This is...

986
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:36,220
谢谢你
Thank you

987
01:47:36,460 --> 01:47:37,360
深田小姐
Kyoko san

988
01:47:37,460 --> 01:47:38,120
嗯
Yes

989
01:47:39,190 --> 01:47:43,320
我小叔子让我买的棒球手套作生日礼物的
My brother-in-law asked me to buy a baseball glove for his birthday

990
01:47:56,310 --> 01:47:58,570
你也一起来玩吗？
Would you care to join us?

991
01:47:59,910 --> 01:48:02,970
今晚不行
Not this evening

992
01:48:08,060 --> 01:48:11,150
我们出事故之后，我也曾尝试邀请小叔子外出
I had invited my brother-in-law out when we had the accident

993
01:48:12,490 --> 01:48:14,480
但他失去了记忆
and he lost his memory

994
01:48:16,830 --> 01:48:21,790
那场意外，不是我仅仅犯有的错误
And the accident wasn't my only sin

995
01:48:24,370 --> 01:48:29,310
我与父母亲戚朋友都隔绝联系
I cast aside my parents, relatives and friends...

996
01:48:38,990 --> 01:48:44,120
要是我有勇气生下怀里的孩子
If I had had the courage to bear that child...

997
01:48:46,130 --> 01:48:47,860
我们现在的情况…
Our path might have...

998
01:48:52,270 --> 01:48:55,060
我是有罪的女人
I am a sinful woman

999
01:49:06,250 --> 01:49:08,220
现在，一切都要交给你照顾了
I leave everything to you

1000
01:49:11,990 --> 01:49:16,920
我会好好对待博士的
I am so grateful to the professor

1001
01:49:30,670 --> 01:49:32,300
现在开始…
From now on...

1002
01:49:34,710 --> 01:49:37,640
这个家的大门，永远为你敞开
this door will always be open

1003
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:23,350
你拥有一颗敏智的心灵
I can tell you've got a wise heart in there

1004
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:28,130
就像立方根号一样，善于接受一切
Like the root symbol, sharing your friendship fairly

1005
01:50:28,230 --> 01:50:29,960
与任何人分享快乐
with anyone

1006
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:35,740
读大学的时候，受伤了
Since that day, until I quit baseball

1007
01:50:36,340 --> 01:50:39,100
退出了棒球队
because of an elbow injury in college,

1008
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:42,200
我珍藏着那手套
I cherished that baseball glove

1009
01:50:42,510 --> 01:50:46,540
但更可贵的是
But what was far more valuable,

1010
01:50:47,010 --> 01:50:51,210
我与教授一起度过的时光弥足珍贵
was the time I spent with the professor, living only in the present

1011
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:07,800
时光的长短，并不重要
Time doesn't matter

1012
01:51:12,310 --> 01:51:16,970
我一直在追寻着梦想，与他一起编织的梦想
I'm still pursuing the dreams I dreamed w th him

1013
01:51:19,110 --> 01:51:21,580
今天到此为止
That's all for today's lesson

1014
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:23,380
起立

1015

1016

1017
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:43,690
嗯
Yes

1018
01:51:44,870 --> 01:51:46,640
谢谢你
Thank you

1019
