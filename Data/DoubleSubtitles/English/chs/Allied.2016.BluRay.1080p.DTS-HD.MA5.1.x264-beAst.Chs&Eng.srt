我们在这个公寓待不了多久

我得让别人相信你是我丈夫

66
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,810
我们一定得小心

我跟大家说我丈夫是巴黎来的

00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,820
还有
And...

70
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,160
你的法语很好
Your French is good,

71
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,160
但是巴黎口音差劲透了
but your Parisian accent is terrible.

72
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,670
我已经练了好几个月了
I've been working on it for months.

73

说说看
Let's hear it.

74
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,980
我说过了
That was it.

75
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:52,170
那麻烦就大了
Oh. So then we're in trouble.

76
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,210
你说的是魁北克法语
That was pure Quebec.

77
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,040
要说你是法属摩洛哥人 也许还能说得过去
With French Moroccans you might be okay,

78
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,850
不过在宴会前 要是碰到真正的巴黎人就要小心了
but we'll have to be careful in front of real Parisians until the party.

79
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,850
宴会在十天后 我的邀请函没问题吧
The party's in 10 days. Is my invitation gonna be a problem?

80
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,560
既然你来了
Now that you're here,

81
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,730
我会安排你跟霍巴先生见面
I'm going to set up a meeting with Herr Hobar.

82
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,260
之后就看你的了
And then it's up to you.

83
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,670
你能在这个小公寓待上十天吗
Can you stand 10 days in this tiny little place,

84
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,170
魁北瓜
Le Québécois?

85
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,300
其实这里也不差
It's not so bad.

86
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,800
有热水 有时候
Water's hot, sometimes.

87
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,640
我睡沙发
I'll take the couch.

88
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,140
其实你要睡屋顶上
Actually, you'll sleep on the roof.

89
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,810
那儿更凉快
It's cooler.

90
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,850
而且卡萨布兰卡的男人跟老婆上完床后
And in Casablanca, the roof is where husbands go

91
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,280
就会去屋顶睡觉
after they've made love to their wives.

92
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,610
你来的第一晚
The neighbors will find it curious

93
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,250
要是我不上来看你 邻居们会好奇的
if I don't come to visit you on your first night.

94
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,860
我经常跟帕杰诺特夫人和珀蒂夫人说起你
I've told Madame Torgenot and Madame Petit all about you.

95
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,590
她们俩这会儿该兴奋了
They'll be very excited.

96
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,000
肯定会猜测我们俩上完床了
They'll guess that the sex is already over.

97
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,000
刚刚感觉还不错
And it was great, by the way.

98
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,800
然后
Then,

99
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,140
你去屋顶上了
you went to the roof.

100
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,740
我很想你
I missed you

101
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,080
因为我已经孤枕难眠好几个月了
because I've been sleeping alone so many months.

102
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,950
所以我上来告诉你我爱你
So I came up to tell you I love you.

103
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,750
你想得很周到
You're very thorough.

104
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,690
所以我还活着
That's why I'm still alive.

105
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,820
我们现在应该聊天
Now we should talk.

106
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,690
说笑
And laugh.

107
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,860
都结婚了 有什么好笑的
Mmm. We're married. Why would we laugh?

108
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,700
吻我
Kiss me.

109
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,050
继续说
Now talk.

110
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,650
告诉我 战后你想做什么
Tell me what you'll do after the war.

111
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,920
我不知道战后要做什么
I don't know what I'll do after the war.

112
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,660
看
Look.

113
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,070
可爱的珀蒂夫人住在七号公寓

114
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,870
她嫁给了一个德国坦克上尉

115
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,410
她正在看着我们
And she's watching us.

116
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,410
所以我们应该有说有笑
So we should talk. And laugh.

117
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,750
好吧
Okay.

120

买牧场
A ranch!

121
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,890
你是说电影里那种
You mean, like in the movies?

122
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,160
牛仔
Cowboys? Bang, bang?

123
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,360
对
Yeah.

124
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,240
你只是随便这么一说，还是真这么想的？
Are you just saying this to say something, or is it real?

125
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,240
是真的 那是
Mmm, it's real.

在梅迪辛哈特市郊
outside a place called Medicine Hat.

128
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,450
我现在知道你是开玩笑了
Now I know you're joking.

129
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,750
你觉得自己真能去那里？
You think you'll ever get there?

130
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,390
不对
Well,

131
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,260
梅迪辛哈特不止是个地方吧
I guess that's not the point of Medicine Hat, huh?

132
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,860
是的
No.

133
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,900
好了 倾述一下并不难 是吧

152
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,650
你的角色老派内敛
You are somewhat formal and reserved.

153
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,860
不过很喜欢昂贵的衣服
But you like expensive clothes.

154
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,660
鞋子总是擦得锃亮
And your shoes are always polished.

155
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,670
我告诉大家你是个严肃的天主教徒
I told everyone you're quite a serious Catholic.

156
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,280
至少你可以闻起来像巴黎人
At least you can smell like a Parisian.

157
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
你自己选衣服吧
I'll leave you to choose.

158
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:45,620
我离开伦敦前 盖伊·桑斯特要我跟你说声谢谢
Before I left London, Guy Sangster asked me to say thank you.

我们一起开过莱桑德式联络机
We flew Lizzies together.

还记得盖伊吗 一九四一年你从迪耶普把他救了出来
You remember Guy? You got him out of Dieppe in '41.

161
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,770
好吧 他怎么说我的

162

他说你美丽动人
He said you were beautiful.

163

很出色
And good.

164
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,550
干这样的活出色可一点也不美
Being good at this kind of work is not very beautiful.

165
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,620
你看起来不错
You look okay.

166

Did you get him an invitation to the Ambassador's party yet?

176
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,030
还在想办法

180
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,640
笑得真够假的
That fake smile.

181
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,260
莫里斯不太擅长交际
Maurice isn't very sociable.

182
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,280
就算为了太太我们也得去 对吧？

You seem to have all Vichy under your spell, Madame Berne.

189
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,930
转过身笑一下 魁北瓜
Turn around and smile, Québécois.

190

195
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,660
他没看你 他在看报纸

谢谢

请你稍等
Please wait a moment

204
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,300
好 我等着
Yes... I'll hold.

205
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,890
那儿好像有人噎着了
Sounds like somebody's choking back there.

206
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,170
好了 亲爱的
Okay, chérie.

207
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,440
我们走吧
Mademoiselle.

208
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,740
冒着雨赶了三个小时的路

209
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,240
我们终于到地儿了

210
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,790
可是眼前根本就不是
But it's not at all

211
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,240
他们跟我们描述过的漂亮的豪华建筑

212
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,660
而是一个小农场

213
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,540
一片漆黑
Pitch black

214
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,040
我们已经准备回去了
We're ready to go back

215
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,710
这时一个穿着破旧的小个子男人出来了
Then a little man in shabby clothes came out

216
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,540
他对我们说

见我不太高兴

219
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,390
莫里斯就对我说
And Maurice said to me

220
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,440
亲爱的 你要知道

223
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,020
莫里斯 我给你介绍个朋友 文森特

224

…他也是巴黎人

225
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:28,990

00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,420
好无聊
I'm bored.

227
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,960
陪我跳舞
Dance with me.

228
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,170
你真够疯的 伯尔尼夫人
You're utterly crazy, Madame Berne.

229
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,710
对啊 稍微疯狂一下感觉很好的
Yes. You could do with being a little crazy yourself.

230
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
真机灵
Well played.

231
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,620
小心那个人
Watch out for him.

232
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,650
那些家伙嫉妒得想杀了我
A lot of jealous guys giving me the evil eye.

233
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,300
那是因为他们知道我爱你
It's because they know I'm in love with you.

234
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,360
显而易见
It's very obvious.

235
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,960
嗯
Mmm.

236
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,240
巴黎出什么事了
What went wrong in Paris?

237
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,570
V部门撇下我们不管了
V Section left us hanging out to dry.

238
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,280
你怎么逃掉的
How'd you get away?

239
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,880
我跑
I ran.

240
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,720
我跑 不停地跑
And ran, and kept on running.

241

珀蒂夫人正在窗户后面看着我们

晚安

00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,710
跟我说说明天要见的

244
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,810
这位霍巴先生

他是大使的联络人

00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:32,160
大使本人会在八点半准时到达
The Ambassador arrives at precisely 8:30.

253
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,230
他要是迟到呢

254
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:37,360
他是德国人 不会迟到的
He's German. He'll be on time.

255
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,260
你怎么不会用斯特恩式轻机枪
How come you don't know Stens?

256
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,700
我会用轻机枪

257
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,970
只是没看到你上了保险栓
I didn't see you set the travel safety.

258
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:50,070
那你晚上用的机枪没问题吧
You'll be okay to use a Sten on the night, though?

259
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,950
需要的话我用餐具都没问题
I would be okay if I had to use cutlery.

260

大使到达五分钟后 八点三十五分开始佯攻
The diversion attack will happen five minutes later at 8:35.

261

剩下的就都交给上帝了

希望他会用保险栓

好热
It's hot.

265
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,250
你在干什么
What are you doing?

266
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,050
考验你
Testing you

267
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,790
就像你考验我一样
the way you tested me.

268
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,890
我知道你拿着武器 瓦坦先生
I know you are armed with a weapon, Mr. Vatan.

269
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:15,190
我只想看看你的保险栓上了没有
I'm just checking your safety catch is engaged.

270
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,330
看
There.

00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,800
我们第一次吵架
We had our first fight.

272
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,200
现在又和好了 对吧
Now we're okay again, yes?

273
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,840
玛丽安
Marianne,

274
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,840
你知道有人跟搭档上了床
we both know people who've fucked each other.

275
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:35,150
然后搞砸了任务死掉了
Then they fucked up, and now they're fucking dead.

276
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,820
你真够直接的
Wow, that's a lot of fucks.

277
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,790
把你的扣子都扣好
Fasten your goddamn buttons.

278
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,500
其实 马克斯
Actually, Max,

279
00:27:55,770 --> 00:28:00,440
他们的错并不是在这种情况下上床
the mistake people make in these situations isn't fucking.

280
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,910
而是相爱
It's feeling.

281
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,690
等很久了吗
Have you been waiting long?

282
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,300
没
Non.

283

My husband's trying to cut down.

287
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,300
说是打起仗来大家都抽得太凶了
He says the war makes everyone smoke too much.

288
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,940
我只知道镇子上的人都在说他的好
I've only heard good things about him around town.

289
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,100
他的好
Good things.

290
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,940

291
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,550
你丈夫不会说英语吗
Your husband doesn't speak English?

292
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,350
就会一点儿
Only a little.

293
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:28,470
你妻子问我可不可以带你去参加大使馆的舞会
Your wife has asked if she could bring you to the Ambassador's Ball tomorrow.

294
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,460
是这样…但是
Yes, but...

295
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,620
…不行的话我也能理解

他好像不太想去
He doesn't seem to want to come.

297
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,830
哦 瓦朗斯街那儿有场牌局
Oh.There is a stupid poker game in the Rue Valence.

298
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,140
明白了
I see.

299
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,210
你说了我什么？
What are you saying about me?

300
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:51,010
别让我丢人 你一定要去 就这么定了
Don't embarrass me. You're coming and that's that.

301
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,280
你丈夫玩扑克吗
So, your husband plays poker?

302
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,610
他特别着迷
Oh, he's obsessed.

303
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,950
我也是 我也是
As am I. As am I.

304
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,350
现在切牌 大牌赢

赢什么
Wins what?

306
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,350
要是他的牌大
If his card is higher than mine,

307
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,960
他就可以去打牌了
he can go to his poker game.

308
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,160
不然的话 就必须参加宴会
If it's lower, he must come to the party.

309
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:11,100
这也太荒唐了
This is too absurd.

310
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,460
洗牌吧 先生
Shuffle, Mr. Berne.

311
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,640
谁牌大谁赢
High card wins.

312
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,520
他是采矿的
Mining?

313
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,590
对
Yes.

314
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,260

没错
That's right.

316
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:01,920
切牌吧 伯尔尼先生 为了你的自由
Now cut, Mr. Berne. For your freedom.

317
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,380
真遗憾
Too bad.

318
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,370
这下你玩不了牌了

还有一件事 新发的邀请函

323
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,690
要走个无聊的小程序
For new names on the list.

324
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,670
伯尔尼先生
Mr. Berne...

325
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:57,590
请在这里写下磷酸盐的化学式

326
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,710
我们明天见
See you both tomorrow.

327
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,750
快要开始了
So, it's in the cards.

328
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,750
我们有机会名留青史了
We get our chance to make history.

329
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,330
我睡不着
I couldn't sleep.

330
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,400

333
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,420
我们出去吧 去看日出
Let's get out of here. Let's go watch the sunrise.

334
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,830
有多大几率
What are our odds?

335
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,560
活下来吗
Of surviving?

336
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,370
六四开
60-40.

337
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,270
六成死
Against.

338
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:39,400
两个人都活下来的几率更小
Both of us, I don't know.

339
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,540
跟我说说梅迪辛哈特吧

遍地绿色 山丘起伏 水流清澈

341
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,620
事情变得糟糕时 我就会想起那里

你呢

你想去哪儿
You have a place?

344
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,360
等仗打完了
When the war is over,

345
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,970
我在哪儿都无所谓
it won't matter where I am.

346
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,550
我们该走了
We should be going.

347
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,480
要是我们明天死了
If we're dead tomorrow,

348
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,320
没人会知道

八点三十二了

357
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,630
离佯攻还有三分钟

358

我发现这种时候想点搞笑的事能放松神经
In this kind of situation, I find it useful to think about something funny.

359
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,830

Quoi?

363

能正眼看我吗
Can you even see me?

364

不能
Not really.

00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,210
这样不好吗
Yes. Isn't it wonderful?

432
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,910
敬我曾经冰山似的弟弟
To my formerly permafrosted brother,

433
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,120
他终于被爱情融化了
thawed at last by love.

434
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,190
还真有诗意
That's rather poetic.

435
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,590
看在上帝的份上
Oh, for goodness sake!

436
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,300
说实话 以后我会想念大轰炸的
Honestly, I'll miss the Blitz.

437
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,070
真的 这种时候没人在乎谁对谁做了什么
I will. No one cares who does what to who.

438
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,240
所以我们应该敬战争和自由
So we should be drinking to war. And freedom.

439
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,110
- 敬战争  - 敬自由
- To war!  - To freedom.

440
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:25,910
玛丽安 我很想恭喜你结婚
Marianne, I would offer you my congratulations,

441
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:28,180
但是我认识马克斯很久了
but I've known Max a long time.

442
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,380
所以我只能祝你好运了
I'll just wish you good luck.

443
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:37,890
不不不 我哥哥就是个坐在无聊的办公室里的
Mmm, no, no, no. Now my brother is just an ordinary man flying a desk

444
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:39,560
普通文员
in some boring office.

445
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,420
马克斯这种天才
Oh, oh, a talented boy like Max

446
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:43,660
弗兰克可留不了多久
won't be behind a desk with Frank for long.

447
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,030
V部门的那些幽灵
Our spooky friends from V Section,

448
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:49,570
肯定会来召唤的 就在你想不到的时候
they will come calling just when you least expect it.

449
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,310
你觉得怎么样 瓦坦夫人
You entirely okay, Madame Vatan?

00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,220
把她扶上去 离墙远点
Get her on it. Away from the wall.

458
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,680
快点 快点
Come on. Come on.

459
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,490
来个人帮忙 过来帮我
Help me, someone! Come and help me!

460
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,620
对 快来帮我
That's it. I need some help!

461
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,960
赶快给我找个灯过来
Get me some light over here now!

462
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:57,470
快出来了
Very close.

463
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,500
好姑娘

非常好 使劲儿
Pant for me. Good girl.

00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,190
这就是我
C'est moi.

466
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:21,120
这就是真正的我 真实得如同站在上帝面前
This is really me, as I am before God.

467
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:40,110
是个女孩
It's a girl.

468
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,070
安娜
Anna...

469
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:07,670
你来了
Anna... it's you.

470
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:23,300
[一年后]

471
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:16,450
[安娜的安全地带]

472
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:36,760
嗯
Mmm.

473

给 庆祝一下
There. A celebration.

474
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,680
- 庆祝什么  - 庆祝你五十七天来休的第一个周末
- For what?   - Your first weekend off in 57 days.

475
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,750
我数着呢
I counted.

476
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,850
是母鸡下的蛋？
Are the eggs from the hens?

477
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,290
是我们母鸡下的蛋
From our hens.

478
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,820
所以养鸡是一笔好投资
Ah, so they were a good investment, hmm?

479
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:08,790
是不是啊
Weren't they?

480
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:10,430
马克斯
Max,

481
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:13,530
我们去荒野采蘑菇吧

482
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:17,630
明天的宴会我要做俄式炖肉

483
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,260

484
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:25,240
亲爱的 我交了很多新朋友 他们都想见你
Oh, darling, I've got lots of new friends who are dying to meet you.

485
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,640
你会喜欢他们的
You'll like them.

486
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,510
其中有难民 知识分子 波西米亚人
They're refugees. Intellectuals. Bohemians.

487
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:33,580
汉普斯特这儿有很多有趣的人
Hampstead is full of interesting people.

488
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,780

可怜的马克斯
Poor Max.

491
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,890
以前我们在卡萨布兰卡 假装过你不喜欢宴会
In Casablanca, we pretended you hated parties,

492
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:45,260
结果呢 竟然是真的
and voilà, it's true!

493
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:52,340
新保姆叫什么？
What's the new nanny's name again?

497
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:01,310
她刚睡醒
She just woke up.

498
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:02,480

499
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,850
就去采点蘑菇
We're just gonna pick some mushrooms.

500
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:05,520
不用着急
Oh, take your time.

501
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:08,220
我很乐意照顾她
It's always my pleasure.

502
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,720
- 好  - 再见

503

504
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:34,640

505
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,680
汉普斯特 二三五

509
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,670
到底什么事这么重要
What the hell is it that's so important?

510
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,610
解放你的祖国
Liberating your country.

511

乔治在你办公室
George is in your office.

515
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:26,300
我记得你是说在你食堂见面
I thought you said to meet you in the mess.

516
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,900
我说谎了
Uh, I lied.

517
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,970
你要见的不是我
It isn't me you're here to see.

518
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:31,830
- 你…  - 不
- Oh, do you...  - No.

519
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,570
V部门想跟你谈谈
No, V Section want to speak to you.

520
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,770
那怎么不是他们打电话
Well, why didn't they call me?

521
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:39,440
因为他们有话
Because V Section, they never say

522
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,480
从不明说 说了也不是那意思
what they mean and they never mean what they say.

523
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,880
而且从不在电话里说
And they never say anything on the phone.

524
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:47,780
你看吧 我就说过他们会来找你的吧 马克斯
I told you they'd come for you eventually, didn't I, Max?

525
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:50,090
我真聪明
Such a clever boy.

526
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:54,490
我看我可以提前祝贺你升职了
Well, I suppose I ought to congratulate you on your promotion.

527
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:57,330
既然你好像很清楚的样子 是什么职位
Since you seem to know so much, what is the position?

528
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:59,860
老兄 这可就大大超出我的安全级别了
Oh, it goes way, way above my level of security, old man.

529
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,400
我就是个传话的
I'm just the messenger boy.

530
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:58,450
- 瓦坦中校  - 弗兰克
- Wing Commander.  - Frank.

531
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,860
坐下吧
Have a seat.

532
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:12,870
我们好像不认识
We haven't been introduced.

533
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:20,110
好了 弗兰克 不管是什么工作 我都不干
Okay, Frank, whatever the job is, I don't want it.

534
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:22,510
我很喜欢跟你共事
I'm perfectly happy to stay with you.

535
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:24,010
马克斯
Max,

536
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:28,050
我恐怕事情并不是你想的那样
I'm afraid this really isn't what you think it is.

537
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,120
只是 好吧…
And, well,

538
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:34,790
这件事有点不太容易说出口
there's no easy way to say what we're about to say.

539
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:39,060
我们认为你的妻子是德国间谍
We believe your wife is a German spy.

540
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,070
好吧 等等 等等
Okay, wait. Wait.

541
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:53,110
说真的 弗兰克 这位是谁
Seriously, Frank, who is this?

542
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:55,140
我是一个捕鼠人
I'm a rat catcher.

543
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:58,950
而且我的军衔比你高 所以你可以称呼我为长官
I also outrank you, so you can call me "sir."

544
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,880
你得听他的 马克斯
You have to listen to him, Max.

545
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:03,550
他的军衔比我们俩的都高
He outranks both of us.

546
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:04,950
过去七天里
Over the past seven days,

547
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,620
V部门监听到了用一台无线电发报机
V Section has intercepted coded messages

548
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:12,460
从伦敦发往柏林的加密信息
being sent from London to Berlin on a WT transceiver.

549
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,730
我们还没追查到具体的地址
We haven't traced the signal to an address yet,

550
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:18,630
但信号是从伦敦北部的海格特地区发出的
but it's coming from the Highgate region of North London,

551
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,800
而这些情报
and the information

552
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:24,210
跟特别行动处在法国的作战行动有关
concerns the activities of SOE circuits in France.

553
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,040
我们破译的一份信息显示 那个特务处发报人
In one transcript, the agent refers to his source as,

554
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:31,110
为“小姐” 所以发报人是个女的
"Fr?ulein." So it's a woman.

555
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:36,750
好吧 好吧 弗兰克 我们能单独谈谈吗
Okay, okay, Frank, can we speak alone for a moment?

556
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:38,050
瓦坦中校
Wing Commander Vatan,

557
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:41,520
你跟你妻子说过工作上的事吗
do you ever speak to your wife about your work?

558
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:43,990
好吧
Okay.

559
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,200
长官 趁我还没失控
Uh, sir, before this thing gets out of hand,

560
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:50,030
我能说句话吗
may I speak? Hmm?

561
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:51,600
我能说句话吗
May I speak?

562
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:53,740
- 可以  - 可以
- Yes.  - Yes?

563
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:57,240
我的妻子是玛丽安·博塞茹尔
My wife is Marianne Beauséjour.

564
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:59,940
玛丽安·博塞茹尔曾经负责
Marianne Beauséjour ran the most

565
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:01,980
巴黎最高效的反抗军情报小组
effective resistance circuit in Paris

566
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:06,150
直到V部门在一九四一年搞砸了一切
until V Section fucked it up for her in '41.

567
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:09,250
我们在卡萨布兰卡认识
We met in Casablanca,

568
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:14,220
并且在那里一起刺杀了德国大使
where together we assassinated the German Ambassador.

569
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:19,160
她是我孩子的母亲
She's the mother of my child.

570
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,200
她给我生了孩子 老天呐
She gave birth to my child, for Chrissake.

571
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,970
这里有一份在托布鲁克被抓获的
This is a translated transcript of an interrogation

572
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:27,800
一个德国军情局军官的审讯笔录译件
of a German Abwehr officer captured in Tobruk.

573
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:31,910
他招供了很多事 并声称玛丽安·博塞茹尔
Amongst many other things, he claims that Marianne Beauséjour

574
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:35,110
和她的组员于一九四一年五月
was arrested and executed in May 1941

575
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:37,680
在巴黎被捕 而她本人被处决了
when the rest of her circuit was captured in Paris.

576
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,950
玛丽安·博塞茹尔这个身份
Marianne Beauséjour's identity

577
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:43,720
被一个长相相似的德国特工所占用
was then given to a German agent of similar build and coloring.

578
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:48,320
她被派去了卡萨布兰卡 那里没人认识真正的玛丽安
She was flown to Casablanca, where no one knew the real Marianne.

579
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:51,090
随后我们调查发现
And it was subsequently discovered

580
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,760
你们俩在卡萨布兰卡
that the German Ambassador

581
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:57,570
刺杀的那个德国大使是个异见分子
who you assassinated in Casablanca was a dissident.

582
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:00,170
希特勒原本就想杀了他
Hitler wanted him killed.

583
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:03,170
这不可能
This is insane.

584
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:08,080
我们截获的所有通讯情报都要经
All the information in the intercepted communications

585
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,210
你的手发出去
had crossed your desk.

586
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,150
对 都要经我的手发出去
Yes, everything crosses my fucking desk.

587
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:17,950
马克斯 现在这是个作战任务
Max, this is now an operational mission.

588
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:21,260
如果玛丽安确实是德国间谍
If Marianne is indeed a German spy...

589
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:24,690
- 我的妻子不是间谍  - 如果她是
- My wife is not a spy!  - If she is,

590
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,960
我们就必须控制她七十二个小时
we need to keep her in place for 72 hours

591
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:30,000
用这段时间找出她的联络人
so that we can identify her handler

592
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,200
铲除其他潜伏的间谍
and clean out the rest of her circuit.

593
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:38,810
不
No.

594
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,890
既然话都讲清楚了
Now we've got that out of the way,

595
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,160
或许我们可以讨论一下
perhaps we could discuss

596
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:03,130
接下来七十二个小时的行动细节
the operational details of the next 72 hours?

597
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,640
所以我们要启动标准的
So, this is gonna be a standard "blue-dye" procedure,

598
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,670
蓝色染料程序 蓝色染料
blue dye being...

599
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:11,270
我知道蓝色染料是什么
I know what a "blue-dye" is.

600
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:16,210
今晚 你会在二十三点零七分接到一个电话
Tonight, you will receive a telephone call at exactly 23:07.

601
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:18,010
重复一下时间 中校
Repeat the time, Wing Commander.

602
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:22,990
- 二十三点零七分 长官  - 你接起电话 写下信息 放在
- 23:07, sir.  - You will take the call and you will write down a message

603
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:24,650
你妻子看得到的地方
somewhere your wife can read it.

604
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,790
情报是假的 只有你会收到
It'll be false information, only you will have it.

605
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:28,720
但看起来级别很高
But it'll appear to be of a high grade,

606
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:30,730
所以她要尽快传递出去
so she will have to pass it on quickly.

607
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:36,870
到下星期一中午时 我们的特工就会破译出敌人周末发出的情报
By midday on Monday, our agents will have decoded enemy traffic from the weekend.

608
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:41,940
所以如果这条假情报出现在从伦敦发出的情报中
So if the false information is among the batches sent from London,

609
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:44,110
我们就能确认了
we shall know for sure.

610
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:48,880
如果你是对的 马克斯 情报译件里就不会有那条情报
If you are right, Max, the information won't appear on the transcripts,

611
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:51,010
那我们就当没这回事儿
and all this will be forgotten.

612
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:57,720
但如果证实你的妻子的确是间谍
But if it is proven that your wife is a spy,

613
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:07,200
我们将立刻启用家属叛国的例行程序
routine procedures in cases of intimate betrayal

614
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,270
例行程序
will apply.

615
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:12,230
你必须亲手处决她
You will execute her with your own hand,

616
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:15,840
要是我们发现你有任何共犯行为
and if we discover that you are an accomplice in any way,

617
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,970
你将以叛国罪之名被处决
you will be hanged for high treason.

618
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:20,740
瓦坦中校 你明白吗
Wing Commander Vatan, do you understand?

619
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:29,020
我需要他亲口确认他明白
He needs to confirm that he understands

620
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:31,020
例行程序
routine procedures in...

621
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:33,460
他明白那个程序 该死
He understands the procedure, damn it.

622
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:36,430
很好
Good.

623
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:40,160
马克斯 你一定不能表现出任何反常
Max, it is vital you do nothing differently.

624
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:43,400
你不要去调查 也不准私自采取行动
You are not to investigate or take matters into your own hands,

625
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,930
明白吗
do you understand?

626
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:51,940
长官 我…
Sir, I, uh...

627
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:57,080
我很抱歉 刚刚我表现得太业余了
I apologize for behaving unprofessionally just then.

628
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:02,490
但是我敢肯定 事实会证明你们搞错了
But I know for a fact you'll be proven wrong.

629
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:07,920
现在 瓦坦中校 你回家去
Now, Wing Commander, you will go home

630
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:09,930
装作什么事都没发生
and carry on as if nothing's happened.

631
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,830
你可以走了
You're dismissed.

632
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:06,550
你去了好久
You were ages.

633
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:09,990
你也知道
You know how it is.

634
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:11,520
一旦去了就走不了
Once you get in, you can't get out.

635
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:21,060
他们要我给一个年轻的飞行员打气
A young pilot needed a pep talk.

636
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,570
还拉我参加了一个作战会议
Then I got dragged into a briefing.

637
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:25,940
嘿
Hey.

638
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,210
给我的吻哪儿去了
What happened to my kiss?

639
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,950
安娜宝贝儿怎么样了
How's the princess?

640
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:37,450
睡着呢
Sleeping.

641
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:47,320
好消息是我周末能休息了
Well, the big news is I definitely have the weekend off.

642
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:51,360
直到电话响起来
Until the phone rings.

643
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,560
不会
Nope.

644
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,960
整个周末都休息
Definitely free the whole weekend.

645
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:15,950
那么
So...

646
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:22,260
可以开宴会了
The party is on.

647
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:27,100
对 可以开宴会了
Yeah, the party's on.

648
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:47,410
我们得为明晚的宴会准备些喝的
We'll need to get some drinks for tomorrow night.

649
01:04:47,410 --> 01:04:48,510
嗯哼
Mmm-hmm.

650
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,580
我明天早上去买
I'll pick some up in the morning.

651
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:02,730
感觉他们像是在监视着我们
It's like they're watching us.

652
01:05:07,130 --> 01:05:09,100
亲爱的 松下手
Honey... Honey, give me my arm.

653
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:11,430
亲爱的 让我腾下胳膊
Honey, give me my arm. Give me my arm.

654
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:15,100
汉普斯特 二三五
Hampstead 235.

655
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:18,010
我是瓦坦中校
Wing Commander Vatan.

656
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,110
- 亲爱的 你有笔吗  - 没有
- Honey, do you have a pen?  - No.

657
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:23,480
说吧
Mmm-hmm. Go ahead.

658
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:33,620
嗯哼
Mmm-hmm.

659
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,590
好
Yeah.

660
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,170
嗯哼
Mmm-hmm.

661
01:05:53,310 --> 01:05:56,110
好 我知道了 明早我会发出去
Yeah, I got it. I'll dispatch it in the morning.

662
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:11,260
别以为我会放你去睡觉 瓦坦先生
Don't think I'm going to let you sleep, Mr. Vatan.

663
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:55,840
我投入了真感情
I keep the emotions real.

664
01:06:57,810 --> 01:06:59,610
所以才能骗得过
That's why it works.

665
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:43,420
回床上去
Come back to bed.

666
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,300
不会有事的
It'll be okay.

667
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:05,710
不会有事的 因为他们搞错了
It'll be okay, because it's not true.

668
01:08:38,610 --> 01:08:39,810
亲爱的
Honey,

669
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:41,880
你怎么穿军装了
you're in uniform.

670
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,610
对 我要去趟基地 去拿点威士忌
Yeah, I'm gonna pop by the base and pick up some whiskey.

671
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:47,350
外事机库里藏了五十箱好酒
There's 50 cases of the good stuff stashed in the diplomatic hangar.

672
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:48,480
拿点没什么的
They won't miss a few.

673
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:50,620
去商店买不行吗
Why not just go to the shop?

674
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:53,260
要拿最好的来招待你的知识分子朋友嘛
Nothing but the best for your intellectuals.

675
01:08:55,890 --> 01:08:58,760
我们在酒吧见 买点啤酒
I'll meet you at the pub after and we'll pick up the beer.

676
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:01,560
好啊
Of course.

677
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:50,880
- 嗨  - 马克斯
- Hi.  - Max.

678
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:54,880
你怎么突然来了
What the hell brings you here?

679
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:58,490
我碰巧路过 请你们参加今晚的宴会
I just dropped by to invite you both to a party tonight.

680
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:00,060
打个电话不就行了
Why didn't you just phone?

681
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,760
马克斯 你现在这个表情
Max, you look like you did

682
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,000
跟你烧了谷仓那次一模一样
the day that you burned the barn down.

683
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:11,500
玛丽安在做菜 你们也来参加吧
Marianne's cooking. Why don't you come by?

684
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:20,340
其实 马克斯 今晚我们可能去不了
Actually, Max, tonight might not be possible.

685
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:21,440
马克斯
Max!

686
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:23,980
马克斯 我听说你进V部门了
Max, I heard that you were in V Section.

687
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:26,580
听着 他们要是让你去做什么自杀任务
If they're offering you some kind of suicide mission,

688
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:28,380
你可以拒绝的 你知道的
you can say no to them, you know that.

689
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:29,720
你回去穿衣服吧
You hardly have anything on.

690
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,790
到底怎么了 马克斯
What's happened? Max.

691
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:36,590
他们要密查玛丽安
They're running a blue-dye on Marianne.

692
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:39,960
我的天呐
Oh, my God.

693
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:42,730
但他们搞错了
But it isn't true.

694
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:44,670
我会证明的
And I will prove it.

695
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,470
今晚我希望你在
I'd like you there tonight.

696
01:11:15,030 --> 01:11:18,430
你好 请问盖伊·桑斯特上校在哪儿
Excuse me. Where can I find Group Captain Guy Sangster?

697
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:20,440
他在小教堂里 先生
He's in the chapel, sir.

698
01:11:35,890 --> 01:11:37,420
你好 盖伊
Hello, Guy.

699
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,820
马克斯·瓦坦中校
Wing Commander Vatan.

700
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:47,460
找我有事吗 马克斯
What do you want from me, Max?

701
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:51,700
我完了 你们把我扔在这里不管了
I'm finished. You people just threw me away.

702
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:56,740
我有事请你帮忙
I need your help.

703
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,740
- 我想问你个问题  - 是吗
- I have a question.  - Yeah?

704
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:05,580
没兴趣
Tough.

705
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:14,020

我被扔在这儿等死 马克斯
I've been left here to fucking rot, Max!

708
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:25,570
你说过一九四一年的时候 玛丽安·博塞茹尔
You told me you were smuggled out of France by Marianne Beauséjour.

712
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:37,050
盖伊 拜托 这是她吗

713
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:40,480
他们没告诉你啊

717
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:54,200
我现在只能看到
All I can see is

模糊的一片白

They're asking people to give blood after the raid,

730

丈夫会在自己抽烟前
A husband would offer his wife a cigarette...

788
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,370
先给妻子一根烟

I thought they would eat something,

813
01:19:57,290 --> 01:19:59,520
而不是忙着喝酒亲热

一半的人我都不认识

看来汉普斯特这儿的消息传的很快
I think word spread around Hampstead.

听着 他们说你要执行任务
I've been briefed that you're operational,

824
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:45,470
但是 他们没告诉我是什么任务
but I haven't been told why you're operational.

825
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:48,200
听着 我觉得作为朋友
Now, look, I thought as a friend

826
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:51,610
我应该稍微提醒你一下
I ought to just give you a word of warning.

827
01:20:52,610 --> 01:20:54,610
要是V部门给你的任务
If the job V Section are offering you is

828
01:20:54,610 --> 01:20:56,950
就是大家现在说的那个

领导法国抵抗运动
in France on D-Day,

831
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,220
他们不会叫你过去
you should know they wouldn't just call you

832
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:04,620
搞个面试
in for a job interview.

833
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:06,720
而是瞒着你考验你
They would test you somehow.

834
01:21:07,490 --> 01:21:08,690
考验
Test?

835
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:12,630
- 怎么考验  - 这可就大大超出我的安全级别了
- How?  - Way, way above my security clearance, old man.

836
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:17,200
但是 我要是你 我会坚决拒绝的
But if I were you, I'd tell them to stick their job.

837
01:21:23,570 --> 01:21:25,040
小心 玛格丽特
Careful, Margaret.

弗兰克 没想到你会来
Frank! I didn't expect you.

841
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,670
麻烦你帮忙让这群人冷静点儿吧
Please introduce a little sobriety to the affair.

842
01:21:50,670 --> 01:21:53,070
我可没打算做这种事儿
I wasn't planning on doing anything of the sort.

843
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:55,000
给我一大杯威士忌和苏打水好吗
A large whiskey and soda, if you please.

846
01:21:58,470 --> 01:22:00,610
你养鸡 对不对
You keep chickens, don't you?

847
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:03,610
弗兰克 你知道得太多了
Frank, you know too much.

848
01:22:03,610 --> 01:22:05,680
带我去看你的鸡 马克斯
Show me your chickens, Max.

849
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:25,300
你故意而且明目张胆地违抗了命令
You willfully and blatantly disobeyed orders.

850
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:27,300
先是去找了盖伊·桑斯特
First you visit Guy Sangster

851
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:28,700
把他气的七窍生烟
and burst half his bloody stitches, then...

852
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:31,440
弗兰克 要是你的妻子 你能相信V部门吗
Frank, if it was your wife, would you trust V Section?

853
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:34,480
亚当·亨特的飞机三个小时前被击毁了
Adam Hunter's Lysander was shot to pieces three hours ago.

854
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:37,510
在着陆点那儿 他在飞机上
On the ground. With him in it!

855
01:22:37,710 --> 01:22:39,380
他死了
He's dead!

856
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:42,350
就因为他在那儿待得太久了 要从一个醉鬼的
Because he stayed too long waiting for an answer

857
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:44,550
嘴巴里等到一个答案
to a question from a drunk.

858
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:47,160
弗兰克 告诉我
Frank, tell me.

859
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:50,260
- 这是个游戏吗  - 游戏
- Is this a game?  - A game?

860
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:51,590
游戏
A game.

861
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:53,130
考验
A test.

862
01:22:55,730 --> 01:22:57,530
我刚刚在跟马克斯说
I was just saying to Max

863
01:22:57,530 --> 01:23:00,800
他在办公室里干得如鱼得水
that he's taken to office life like a duck to water.

864
01:23:03,070 --> 01:23:04,410
我不知道
I wouldn't know.

865
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:06,140
我很少见到他
I hardly see him.

866
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,710
好了 亲爱的 我们跳舞吧
Come on, honey, let's dance.

867
01:23:19,090 --> 01:23:21,160
弗兰克带了坏消息来？
Frank brought you bad news?

868
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,560
又死了一个飞行员
Another boy dead.

869
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:30,470
我感觉应该比死人更严重吧
Something more than that, I think.

870
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:34,140
我问布里奇特你是不是不对劲
I asked Bridget if there was something wrong with you,

871
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:36,200
她说你没事
and she said you were fine.

872
01:23:37,670 --> 01:23:40,440
她可不像我们这样专门学过骗人
But she's not trained to lie like you and me.

873
01:23:45,810 --> 01:23:48,720
我们有个任务失败了 我不能多说
We've had a setback. I can't talk about it.

874
01:23:54,790 --> 01:23:57,260
烤箱里有东西糊了
I think something's burning in the oven!

875
01:23:57,260 --> 01:23:59,390
好像是俄式炖肉的味道
It could be the stroganoff.

876
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:16,480
你先退下 上尉
Stand down, Flight Lieutenant.

877
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:18,510
- 玛格丽特  - 长官
- Margaret?  - Sir.

878
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:21,150
明天还往迪耶普空投吗
Is the Dieppe drop still on tomorrow?

879
01:24:21,150 --> 01:24:22,680
我想应该会的 长官
I believe it is, sir.

880
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:25,490
- 天气情况怎么样  - 晴天 长官
- Forecast?  - Clear skies, sir.

881
01:24:53,450 --> 01:24:54,650
嘿
Hey.

882
01:24:56,190 --> 01:24:58,520
那个抽烟斗的 他是谁
The man with the pipe. Who is he?

883
01:24:58,790 --> 01:25:00,450
他叫隆巴德
His name is Lombard.

884
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:02,660
在商业街上开了家珠宝店
He has a jewelry shop on the high street.

885
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:05,460
他向我推销一个钻石胸针
He was trying to sell me a diamond broach.

886
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:07,800
不过我说我们破产了
But I told him we're broke.

887
01:25:10,330 --> 01:25:12,200
你要去哪儿
Hey, where are you going?

888
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:13,800
- 马克斯  - 玛丽安
- Max!  - Marianne.

889
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:14,870
我想跟你说点事
I really need to speak to you.

890
01:25:14,870 --> 01:25:16,270
杰弗里 你喝醉了
Oh. Jeffrey, you're too drunk.

891
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:25,610
嘿
Hey.

892
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,950
你的妻子改主意了
Your wife changed her mind.

893
01:25:31,690 --> 01:25:33,590
你说的是耳环吗
You mean about the earrings.

894
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,490
不不不 我想卖给她的是胸针
No, no, no, I was trying to sell her a broach.

895
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,560
不过我确实有些漂亮的耳环
I do have some beautiful earrings.

896
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:41,300
而且可以给你个优惠价
I can offer you a very good price.

897
01:25:41,430 --> 01:25:42,560
马克斯
Max.

898
01:25:43,830 --> 01:25:47,500
不用了 隆巴德先生 我们真的破产了
It's okay, Mr. Lombard. We really are broke.

899
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:50,840
晚安
Good night.

900
01:25:51,370 --> 01:25:52,370
晚安
Good night.

901
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:12,390
我去看看安娜
I'll have to get Anna.

902
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:24,940
- 我没听到警报  - 警报怎么没响
- I didn't hear a siren.  - Where were the sirens?

903
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:28,980
总算响了
Now they sound the alarm.

904
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:31,480
这什么警报啊 总是慢两拍
Bloody ARP, always two steps behind.

905
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:34,280
赶快把灯给关掉
Get these bloody lights off!

906
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:44,360
他们又轰炸东区了
They're targeting the East End again.

907
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:48,960
这一片应该没事
We should be all right here.

908
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:52,030
马克斯 别再搞事了
Max, no more.

909
01:26:52,830 --> 01:26:54,370
拜托
Please?

910
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:57,570
到星期一上午
By Monday morning, we'll...

911
01:26:57,570 --> 01:26:59,570
我们就知道结果了
We'll know for sure.

912
01:27:01,310 --> 01:27:03,080
去休息一下吧
Try and get some rest.

913
01:27:05,310 --> 01:27:07,650
- 弗兰克  - 这不是游戏
- Frank?  - It's not a game.

914
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:11,820
就算它是
Even if it is,

915
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:15,620
V部门也不会告诉你的
V Section wouldn't tell you.

916
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:17,090
对不对
Would they?

917
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,430
他们不会告诉你的 弗兰克
They wouldn't tell you, Frank.

918
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,370
看
Look!

919
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:32,570
击落一架 好耶
We got one! Yes!

920
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:57,830
飞机朝我们这边来了
It's heading right towards us!

921
01:27:57,830 --> 01:27:59,570
大家快找掩护
Everyone take cover!

922
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:04,110
蹲下
Get down!

923
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:09,610
马克斯
Max!

924
01:28:36,570 --> 01:28:38,510
你去让大家散了好吗
Will you get rid of everyone?

925
01:28:39,710 --> 01:28:40,880
好
Yeah.

926
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:47,680

我很愿意
I'd like that.

932
01:30:25,510 --> 01:30:27,820
谁要先跳呀
Who's gonna jump first?

933
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:32,720
我生火了 过来跟我们一起坐吧

What the hell are you doing? Why have you switched off the engine?

939

别耍我 德拉马尔
Don't you fuck with me, Delamare.

984
01:36:19,130 --> 01:36:21,030
