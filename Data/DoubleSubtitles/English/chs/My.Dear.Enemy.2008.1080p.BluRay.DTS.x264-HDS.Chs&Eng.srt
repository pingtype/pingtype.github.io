00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,380
海绵电影公司呈献
Presented by SPONGE

4
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,000
在哪呢？
Where's that?

5
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,500
在去岑春的路上
A SPONGE and bom Film Produtions production Somewhere on the way to Choon-chun.

6
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,090
她的地刚买了就翻了一番
Her land doubled in price right after she bought it.

7
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,710
现在每英亩值七十万
It's now worth $700 an acre.

8
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,010
她挣了多少？
How much did she make?

9
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:56,880
她四十万一英亩买的，所以差不多挣了三千万
She bought it at $400 per acre. So probably around $30,000.

10
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,880
三千万？
$30,000?

11
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,050
- 哇  - 挣得真容易呀
- Wow.  - Easy money.

12
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:15,050
这些天她不容易联系上，她不接我电话
She's hard to reach these days. Won't take my calls.

13
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,960
你在哪呢？
Where are you?

14
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:30,540
你为什么不打个电话？我们一直在外边等着呢
Why didn't you call? We were waiting outside.

15
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,620
嗯
Yeah.

16
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,750
好的
Okay.

17
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,420
哪一层？
What floor?

18
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,540
好的
Okay.

19
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,210
现在投资地产太晚了吧？
Think it's too late for a stab at that?

20
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,210
你是在问我吗？
You're asking me?

21
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,630
或许不晚，既然都能翻一倍
Maybe not, since it already doubled.

22
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,210
不是谁都能买地赚钱的
Not everyone can make money on buying land.

23
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,880
我应该问问她吗？
Should I try asking her?

24
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,510
我告诉你了，她甚至都不接电话
I told you, she's not even taking calls.

25
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,870
为什么？
Why?

26
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,200
或许她不想请我喝饮料吧
Maybe she's trying to avoid buying drinks.

27
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,300
她以前也没请过
She never bought drinks even before.

28
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,500
去哪？
Where to?

29
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,800
我们应该吃点什么？
What should we eat?

30
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,300
这附近没什么吃的
There's nothing to eat around here.

31
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,500
- 你想吃什么？ - 我？
- What do you want?  - Me?

32
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,090
- 你要吃什么？ - 能快点吃完的就成
- What are you eating?  - Anything fast.

33
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,250
- 我需要更多时间来分析  - 那好像也没用呀
- I need more analyzing time.  - Like that will ever help.

34
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,170
- 蛤蜊汤怎么样？ - 什么？
- How about clam chowder?  - Again?

35
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,040
- 快速吃完，然后回来  - 我讨厌喝汤
- Eat fast and come back.  - I hate soup.

36
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,760
那就去做你的分析去吧
Then just go do your analyzing.

37
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,760
难道我们不能吃米饭吗？
Can't we get rice?

38
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,170
- 小心点，女士！ - 对不起
- Watch it, lady!  - Sorry.

39
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:34,090
- 内情简报也没用呀  - 内情简报就是个简报而已
- Damn dope sheet's not helping.  - Dope sheet's just a dope sheet.

40
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,500
看看它长得多好
Look how good she looks.

41
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,120
- 再问一下，它是多少号？ - 12号
- What's her number again?  - 12

42
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,710
哥们，这很那选呀
Man, this is hard.

43
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,130
看看它的脚步多轻盈
Watch how lightly her steps look.

44
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,050
- 你怎么知道？ - 今天是它的幸运日
- How can you tell?  - Today's her day.

45
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,550
要是我赢不了，我就惨了
If I don't win here, I'm screwed.

46
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,040
我警告过你第一次玩不要赌大的
I warned you not to bet big on the first game.

47
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,460
或许我本应在房地产试试运气的
Maybe I should've tried my luck in real estate.

48
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,960
好像那更容易
Like that's easy.

49
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,460
你在这干什么？
What are you doing here?

50
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,630
世界真小呀，嗯？
Small world, huh?

51
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,040
你怎么样？
How've you been?

52
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,330
我要我的钱
I want my money.

53
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,010
你借的那三百五十万
The $3,500 you borrowed.

54
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,620
- 为什么？真突然呀  - 我不是开玩笑
- Why, all of a sudden...  - I'm not kidding!

55
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,420
- 咱们抽支烟去  - 好
- Let's go for a smoke.  - Okay.

56
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,420
那么说你来这是为了找我？
So you came here looking for me?

57
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,420
不管怎么说，见到你很高兴，我真的很想你
Anyway, it's good to see you. I really missed you.

58
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,510
咱们坐下，叙叙旧吧
Let's sit down and catch up.

59
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,130
你的手这么冷，你吃饭了吗？
Your hand's so cold. Did you eat?

60
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,090
把我的钱给我就成了！
Just give me my money!

61
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,670
我会的，我会的
I will. I will.

62
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,880
- 但这么长时间…  - 嗨！
- But it's been so long...  - Hey!

63
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,880
就来我喜欢的样，谢谢
Just the way I like it. Thanks.

64
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,050
但有点苦
But it's a tad bit bitter.

65
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,460
那就点拿铁而不是一般的
Then just order the latte not regular.

66
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,460
不是一样的
It's not the same.

67
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,160
来一杯吗，喜秀？
Want one, Hee-su?

68
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,460
对了，你不喝咖啡
Right, you don't drink coffee.

69
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,590
你们有绿茶吗？
Do you have green tea?

70
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,960
有，你要来一杯吗？
Yes, would you like one?

71
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:58,300
算了吧，输了很多钱，她有点不开心
It's okay. She's a little down from losing big.

72
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,500
你气色不错，经常锻炼吗？
You look good. Been working out?

73
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,000
那边有自动取款机
There's an ATM over there.

74
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,630
我知道，我会给你钱的
I know. I'll pay you.

75
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,630
难道不奇怪吗？
Isn't it strange?

76
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,710
奇怪什么？
What is?

77
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,920
我们好久不见了，难道不应先聊聊吗？
It's been a while since we met. Shouldn't we talk first?

78
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,210
比方说“你怎么样？你看起来不一样”这之类的话
Like 'How've you been? ', 'You look different', and so on.

79
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,250
我就是来要回我的钱的，所以就快点吧
I just came to get my money back. So just hurry.

80
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,840
但我们刚见面，你怎么说的都是钱？
But we just met and all you talk about is money?

81
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,130
那很没劲
That's not fair.

82
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,130
没劲？
Not fair?

83
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:44,170
拿了我的钱，一年都没打个电话，你怎么还好意思这么说？
How can you say that after taking my money and not calling for a year?

84
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,960
都已经有一年了？
Has it been a year, already?

85
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,370
我想你是对的
Guess you're right.

86
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,170
你忘了吗？
Did you forget?

87
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,170
当然没有，对不起
Of course not. I'm sorry.

88
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,170
我来这不是接受道歉的
I didn't come for an apology.

89
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,000
我想的就是要回我的钱
All I want is my money back.

90
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,590
我还有你写给我的欠条
I still have the IOU you wrote me.

91
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,790
有人骗过你的钱吗？
Did someone con you out of money?

92
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,160
拿这个干吗？
What's with this?

93
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,540
我看起来像骗子吗？
Do I look like a con-man?

94
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,540
得了，你可以信任我
Come on, you can trust me.

95
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,540
好吧，我是个骗子
Fine. I'm a con-man.

96
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:40,380
我只是开个玩笑，别这样，你过去爱听我的笑话
I was just kidding. Come on. You used to laugh at my jokes.

97
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,210
好吧
Fine.

98
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,250
把你的账户写下来
Write your account number down.

99
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,960
你要去哪，金秀？
Where're you going Jin-su?

100
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,250
我有活要跑
I got an errand to run.

101
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,790
- 咱们喝杯咖啡吧  - 日后吧
- Let's grab a coffee.  - Later.

102
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,120
- 我日后把钱汇给你  - 什么？
- I'll wire it to you, later.  - What?

103
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,120
我会把钱打到你账上
I'll send it to your account.

104
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,510
不行，现在就给我
No. Just give it to me now.

105
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,870
我给不了，我一分钱没有
I can't. I don't have any money.

106
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,710
因为经济危机之类的事情
With the economic slump and all.

107
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,290
- 如果我知道我会遇到你，我…  - 赵秉云
- If I knew I'd bump into you I'd...  - CHO Byung-woon.

108
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,300
你认为我傻吗？
You think I'm stupid?

109
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,590
你来赌马不带钱吗？
You come to the race-track with no money?

110
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,710
事情不像看起来那样
It's not what it looks.

111
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,300
我有我的原因
I have my reasons.

112
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,800
想听我对你解释一切吗？
Want me to explain everything to you?

113
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,420
我不想听你胡说八道！
I don't want to listen to your crap!

114
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,290
无论如何，我今天就要我的钱
I'm getting my money today no matter what.

115
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,160
最后十分钟下注
10 minutes to final biddings.

116
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,550
这些天我相当穷
I'm pretty broke these days.

117
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:05,540
有什么不对吗，喜秀？
Is something wrong, Hee-su?

118
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,580
你的脸…
Your face...

119
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,880
或许是个新妆容吧？
Maybe it's the new make-up?

120
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,670
我说真的
I'm serious.

121
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,790
你怎么付给我钱？
How'll you pay me?

122
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,590
我有我的办法，今天就给你
I have my ways. I'll get it to you, today.

123
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,660
相信我，回家去吧
Trust me and go home.

124
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,750
什么？
What?

125
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,300
告诉过你了，不拿到钱我是不会走的
I told you I'm not leaving till I get my money.

126
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,500
这么说你想一直跟着我了？
So you wanna go around with me?

127
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,910
没错
Yes.

128
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,000
好吧，随你便
Employees Only Fine, whatever.

129
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,800
你不看比赛就走吗？
You're leaving without watching the race?

130
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,580
不了，突然有事
Yeah, something came up.

131
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,620
- 明天怎么样？ - 我尽量来
- What about tomorrow?  - I'll try to come.

132
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,120
明晚姑娘们要出去玩
The girls are going out tomorrow night.

133
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,000
真的吗？
Really?

134
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,380
我们打算去你说的那个酒吧
We're going to the Sake pub you told us.

135
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,170
要来吗？
Wanna come?

136
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,290
我尽量，谢谢帮我看包
I'll try. Thanks for watching my bags.

137
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,790
打电话给我
Call me.

138
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,380
太好了
So nice.

139
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,170
咱们走吧
Let's go.

140
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,710
我需要现金，你知道我的情况
I need it in cash. You know my situation.

141
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,170
你什么时候方便我就过去
I'll come whenever's good for you.

142
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,880
我先接个电话，一会打给你
I got another call. Call you right back.

143
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,880
你在睡觉吗？
Were you sleeping?

144
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,460
我给你打了好几次电话
I called you several times.

145
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,160
对
Yeah.

146
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,370
好的
Okay.

147
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,340
你知道
You know.

148
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,960
就是打个电话看看你还好吗
Just called to see how you're doing.

149
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,250
车不错呀，什么时候买的？
Nice car. When'd you get it?

150
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,670
你刚才说道哪了？
You were saying?

151
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,420
当然
Of course.

152
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,250
不是那样的
It's not that.

153
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,330
不，不是你想的那样
No, it's not what you think.

154
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:17,750
只是想知道，你的角膜手术怎么样了
Just wondering how your Lasik surgery went.

155
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,710
真的？
Really?

156
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,420
已经有一个月了吗？
Has it been a month, already?

157
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,050
时间过的真快呀
Time flies, huh?

158
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,250
都愈合了吗？
Then they're all healed?

159
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,250
我很走运眼睛没问题
I'm lucky to have good eyes.

160
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,710
你在哪呢？
Where are you?

161
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,420
釜山？
Busan?

162
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,290
你为什么老去那？
Why are you all the way there?

163
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,800
你什么时间回来？
When are you coming up?

164
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,380
回来后给我打电话，咱们见见面
Call me when you get back. Let's meet up.

165
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,380
一起吃晚饭，很好
Dinner sounds good.

166
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,590
好的，再见
Okay, bye.

167
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,000
这车看起来很新呀
The car looks fairly new.

168
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,000
怎么了？
Now what?

169
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,420
好像就是昨天我教你开车
It seems like just yesterday when I was teaching you to drive.

170
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,910
在阳浙江边上，记得吗？
Near Yangje River? Remember?

171
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,710
那么有什么计划？
So what's the plan?

172
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,080
都安排好了，我们只需要去拿就成了
It's all set. We just need to go get it.

173
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,750
- 那就告诉我去哪  - 稍等
- Then tell me where to go.  - Hold on.

174
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,050
对
Yeah.

175
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,540
什么？
What?

176
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,050
我电池快没电了，一会打给你
My battery's low. I'll call you right back.

177
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,960
把你的手机给我
Give me your phone.

178
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,960
这是去拿你的钱，给我
It's to get your money. Hand it over.

179
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,330
别这样
Come on.

180
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,960
就这样罢工了？
Did this just come out?

181
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,870
这些高科技玩意…
All this high tech...

182
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,750
但要是电池没电了，这东西就完全没用了
But if the battery's out, the thing's absolutely useless.

183
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,840
- 我们这到底是要去哪？ - 开出去
- So where The hell are we going?  - Pull out.

184
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,290
是我，什么时间？
It's me. What time?

185
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,910
我会过来的，打我这个号码
I'll come over. Call me at this number.

186
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,790
你这东西有电视看吗？
Do you get TV on this?

187
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,290
- 咱们开开电视，看看新闻吧  - 别碰它
- Let's turn it on and watch the news.  - Don't touch it.

188
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,960
看起来某人不缺钱呀
Doesn't look like someone hard on cash.

189
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,580
嗯？
Huh?

190
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,300
你是在问我吗？
You're asking me?

191
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,080
我真的很想知道，你过得怎么样？
I'm dying to know. How've you been?

192
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,870
你要是不说，我会胡思乱想的
I'll imagine crazy things if you don't tell me.

193
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,580
该死，这个真苦
Damn this is bitter.

194
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,380
你为什么这么生我气？
Why are you so mad at me?

195
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,960
什么？
What?

196
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,870
你觉着我生气了吗？
You think I'm angry?

197
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,380
你弄得好像我是你的死敌似的
You've been acting like you're with a mortal enemy.

198
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,050
你偷我的钱，电话不打一个，你还指望什么？
You steal my money and don't call. What'd you expect?

199
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,750
什么？偷？
What? Steal?

200
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,290
- 别这么说  - 没啥可狡辩的
- Aw, come on.  - No excuses.

201
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,210
- 别这样，听我把话说完  - 我不想听
- Come on, hear me out.  - I don't want to hear it.

202
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,830
你以前也爱吵架，但没这么厉害
You were feisty before but not this much.

203
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,840
你变了
You've changed.

204
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,130
前面街右转
Turn right up the street.

205
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,540
前方右转
Turn right up ahead.

206
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,840
这玩意真不错呀
This is pretty neat.

207
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,790
我应该准备好
I should get ready.

208
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:19,880
欠条
IOU

209
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,210
你结婚了吗？
Did you get married?

210
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,790
或许结了，对吧？
Probably did, right?

211
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,090
不关你的事
None of your business.

212
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,790
我们上次见面的时候
When we last met.

213
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:43,340
你辞了工作，忙着准备你的婚礼
You quit your job and were busy preparing for your wedding.

214
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,750
那家伙是某个大基金经理，对吧？
The guy was some big shot funds manager, right?

215
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,330
很奇怪呀
That's strange.

216
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,670
怎么了？
What is?

217
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,540
没什么
Oh, nothing.

218
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,910
呆在这，我马上回来
Stay here, I'll be right back.

219
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,460
等等！
Wait!

220
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,460
为什么我们来这？
Why are we here?

221
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,250
来拿你的钱，笨蛋
To get your money, silly.

222
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,510
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

223
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,620
怎么了？你不相信我？
What? You don't trust me?

224
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,710
- 不相信  - 那和我一起来吧
- No.  - Then come with me.

225
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,500
嗨，你不能在那停车
Hey, you can't park there.

226
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:46,800
就停一小会，马上就走
We're just making a quick stop. We'll be right out.

227
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:52,210
访客必须把车停到地下停车场
All visitors must park in the parking lot underground.

228
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,420
咱们去停下车吧，喜秀
Let's just park the car, Hee-su.

229
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,790
我们会停停车场里的
We'll park it in the lot.

230
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:04,410
停车费每十分钟1500块
The parking fee is $1.50 for every 10 minutes.

231
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,160
什么？
What?

232
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,880
这儿？
Here?

233
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,970
这也是收费停车场
This is paid parking, too.

234
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,460
公共停车场周六是免费的
Public parking lots are free on Saturdays.

235
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,080
我肯定不是
Bet they're not.

236
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,750
- 是，是免费的  - 相信我，不免费
- No, it's free.  - Trust me, it's not.

237
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,920
你们要停多长时间？
How long are you staying?

238
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,910
- 我必须付钱吗？ - 是的，女士
- I have to pay?  - Yes, ma'am.

239
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,420
- 我告诉过你了  - 周六难道不是免费的吗？
- Told you.  - Isn't it free on Saturdays?

240
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,710
只有周日和节假日才免费
Only on Sundays and holidays.

241
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,710
咱们就把车停这吧
Let's just park here.

242
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,340
该死的
Damn it.

243
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,920
或许这更便宜
It's probably cheaper here.

244
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,210
把那东西拆来拆去，你难道不嫌烦吗？
Aren't you tired of putting that thing in and out?

245
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,630
你认为它会被偷吗？
Think it'll get stolen?

246
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,710
藏东西是我的爱好，好吗？
Hiding things is my hobby, okay?

247
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,420
看到没？你又生气了
See? You're mad again.

248
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,790
要我付停车费吗？
Want me to pay for parking?

249
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,800
我会付的
I'll pay.

250
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,790
难道你不认为是该我们坦诚地谈谈了吗？
Don't you think it's about time we start seeing things eye to eye?

251
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:52,960
对我也很难，我不知道要做什么
It's hard for me, too. I don't know what to do.

252
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,870
我们应该谈谈我们的未来，还有…
We should talk about our future and...

253
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,370
能打扰一下吗？
Excuse Me?

254
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,880
需要帮忙吗？
Can I help you?

255
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,370
我和韩总有个预约
I have an appointment with President Han?

256
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,460
你的名字是…
Your name is...

257
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,090
赵秉云
CHO Byung-woon.

258
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,830
她现在在楼顶上
She's on the roof at the moment.

259
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,340
跟我来
Follow me.

260
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,960
我们稍后聊
We'll talk later.

261
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,040
- 想等在这吗？ - 咱们走
- Wanna wait here?  - Let's go.

262
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,040
但外边冷
But it's cold out.

263
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,210
相当有劲
Pretty sharp.

264
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,090
打的还好吗？
Was it okay?

265
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,000
不错
Not bad.

266
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,090
但你打的有点靠下，稍微轻点
But, you're getting a little duff. Just slightly.

267
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,300
你说得对，为什么会这样？
You're right. Why's that?

268
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,210
你再握住球杆
Hold the club again.

269
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,420
- 再试一下  - 好的
- Try it again.  - Okay.

270
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,460
你的站姿和动作都很好
Your stance and posture are good.

271
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:47,340
或许是由于你触球前手腕太用力了
Maybe it's 'cuz you're using your wrists too much before impact.

272
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,550
我的高尔夫教练也这么说
My golf instructor said the same thing.

273
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,670
但我还以为我有进步了呢
But I thought I got better.

274
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,260
难怪我的杆数低不下来
No wonder my score isn't getting any lower.

275
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,160
哦，天哪！
Oh, man!

276
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:03,090
人人都有低谷期，再试试
Everyone goes through a slump. Try again.

277
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,330
打得好！
Nice shot!

278
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,090
非常完美
Just perfect.

279
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,910
能把手给我看看吗，女士？
May I see your hand for a sec, ma'am?

280
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,510
- 我的手？ - 对
- My hand?  - Yes.

281
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,340
看到这些老茧了吗？
See the calluses here?

282
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,910
这证明了你右手太用劲了
This proves you're using your right arm and hand too much.

283
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,540
你说得对
You're right.

284
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,370
想想一下，就像手里抓的是只麻雀
Think of it as holding a sparrow in your hand.

285
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,920
- 麻雀？真恶心  - 打个比方而已
- A sparrow? That's gross.  - So to speak.

286
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,620
稍等，喜秀
Hold on, Hee-su.

287
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:49,000
- 你和别人一起来的吗？ - 就是我说的那个朋友
- You came with someone?  - The friend I mentioned.

288
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,960
你的朋友很漂亮
Your friend is very pretty.

289
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,660
没这些糟糕的事前，她更漂亮
She was much prettier before things got rough.

290
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,460
你打高尔夫吗？
Do you golf?

291
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,380
不打
No.

292
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,960
你呢，秉云？
How about it Byung-woon?

293
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,880
慢节奏的运动不适合我
Slow paced sports aren't for me.

294
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,170
我更喜欢快节奏的运动，比方说骑马、滑雪
I'm more into fast action sports like horseback riding or skiing.

295
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,460
和年轻人一起玩很好
It'd be nice to play with young people.

296
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,840
我不喜欢和老家伙们一起玩
I hate going out on the field with old timers.

297
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,840
- 高尔夫是很棒的运动  - 当然是了
- Golf is a great sport.  - Of course it is.

298
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,210
不，谢谢
No thank you.

299
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:08,200
我最近不抽了，你也是吗？
I recently quit. You, too?

300
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,630
我也不抽了
I quit, too.

301
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,330
- 就再抽一次，嗯？ - 当然可以了
- Just one more, then?  - Sure.

302
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,050
- 我不喜欢一个人抽烟  - 当然了
- I don't like smoking alone.  - Of course.

303
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,830
那我也…
Then I'll...

304
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,870
哦，对了
Oh, right.

305
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,090
康先生？
Mr. Kang?

306
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,000
嗨！
Hey!

307
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,080
把我要的东西拿来
Bring me what I asked for.

308
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,500
她一直多方面帮助过我，喜秀
She's been helping me out in many ways, Hee-su.

309
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,670
不，正相反，是你在帮助我
No, it's the other way around. You're helping me.

310
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,880
但做的远远不够，夫人
But not nearly enough, ma'am.

311
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,750
你总是那么会说话，太可爱了
You always know just what to say. So cute.

312
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,250
我听说发生的事了
I heard what happened.

313
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,960
但我只能给你一百万
But I can only give you $1,000.

314
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,550
今天我有些大交易要做
I have some big transactions today.

315
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,750
拿着吧，谢谢她，喜秀
Take it and thank her, Hee-su.

316
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,550
可以吗？
Is that okay?

317
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,830
当然了，女士，一百万是很多的钱呀
Of course, ma'am. $1,000 is a lot of money.

318
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,460
我们非常感谢，对吧？
We're very thankful. Right?

319
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:38,830
听说像你这样一个年轻女人深陷这样的麻烦，我很伤心
I'm sad to hear that a young woman like you are in such trouble.

320
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,160
这是给你的
And this is for you.

321
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,090
- 这是什么？ - 是欠条
- What's this?  - It's an IOU.

322
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,010
欠条？
An IOU?

323
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:52,000
真有意思！你做的事都这么可爱
How sweet. Everything you do is so cute.

324
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:57,080
我本应咬破手指按血手印的
I should bite my finger and sign it in blood.

325
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,580
但我有点贫血
But I'm kinda anemic.

326
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,080
所以我就只是签了个名
So I signed it instead.

327
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,290
- 很好，我可不想看到你受伤  - 谢谢你
- Good. Wouldn't want you to get hurt.  - Thank you.

328
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:15,500
那么我们要走了
Then we'll be on our way.

329
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,920
现在就走吗？难道你们不留下来吃午饭吗？
Already? Can't you stay for lunch?

330
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,920
附近有家很好的鳗鱼餐厅
There's a good eel restaurant around.

331
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,210
鳗鱼？
Eel?

332
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,300
我喜欢鳗鱼，但是…
I love eel but...

333
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:30,170
下次吧，女士，我今天要帮我朋友的忙
Next time, ma'am. I gotta help out my friend, today.

334
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,250
给，一点小意思
Here. A sign of my appreciation.

335
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,330
这是给我的吗？
This is for me?

336
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,250
为了帮助你戒烟，我的意思是少抽点
To help you stop smoking. I mean, smoke less.

337
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,040
百分之九十九
99%?

338
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,670
有点遗憾
It's sort of sad.

339
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,870
是差百分之一
It's missing 1%.

340
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:03,090
正如对你而言，我也不是百分之百好
Just like I can't ever be perfect for you.

341
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,290
我想这就是生活
Well, that's life I guess.

342
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,290
你为什么走这么快？等等！
Why are you walking so fast? Wait!

343
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,210
怎么了？还生气吗？
What? Still angry?

344
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,710
至少我给你一百万了
At least you got your $1,000.

345
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,210
开头很不错呀
It's a great start.

346
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,120
高兴点，天气不错
Lighten up. It's a nice day.

347
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:29,040
我们非常感谢你的帮助？
We're very thankful for your help?

348
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,710
我们？我为什么要感谢她？
WE? Why do I have to be thankful to her?

349
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:35,120
感谢别人的帮助是基本礼节
It's common courtesy to thank someone for helping.

350
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:39,210
她帮的人不是我！是你！
I'm not the one she helped out! You are!

351
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,210
我只是来拿我的钱！
I just came to get my money!

352
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:44,000
别急，我知道
Relax. I know.

353
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,580
不管怎么说，那位女士可能现在心情不错
Anyway, that lady's probably in a good mood, now.

354
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,380
帮了我们的忙，感到高兴和自豪
Feeling happy and proud about helping us out.

355
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,670
给，拿着这个
Here, take this.

356
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
拿着
Come on.

357
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,460
从别人那借钱，但让他们觉着很高兴借给你
Borrow the money but make them feel good about lending it.

358
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,290
这样大家都高兴
Then everyone's happy.

359
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:03,010
你知道的，有钱人更吝啬
The rich are stingier you know.

360
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,880
凭空借一百万，很不容易
Lending $1000 out of the blue? That's not common.

361
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,540
艾米连科·菲多综合格斗大赛
M-1 Festival with Emelianenko Fedor

362
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,120
等等，喜秀！
Wait, Hee-su!

363
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,500
艾米连科菲多综合格斗大赛
M-1 Festival with Emelianenko Fedor

364
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,960
有好CD吗？听点音乐怎么样？
Got any good CDs? How about some music?

365
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,710
我在车里不听音乐
I don't listen to music in the car.

366
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:47,630
你过去随身带着满是歌曲的MP3
You used to carry around an MP3 player filled with songs.

367
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,830
你总让我听你最爱的歌手
You always used to make me listen to your favorite singer.

368
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:57,910
她名叫艾斯…巴特什么来着，对吧？
Her name was Ast... Bart or something, right?

369
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,630
艾斯特·吉芭托
Astrud Gilberto.

370
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:02,040
就是她，唱歌懒洋洋的
That's it. The drowsy singer.

371
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:08,340
但她的歌听着很舒服
Her songs were comforting, though.

372
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,710
- 只是好奇…  - 什么？
- Just wondering...  - What?

373
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,410
没什么
Nothing.

374
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,420
好奇什么？
What is it?

375
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:50,880
- 刚才的那个女人  - 嗯？
- That woman back there.  - Yeah?

376
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,420
你和她睡觉吗？
Do you sleep with her?

377
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,840
终于开始对我的生活感兴趣了，嗯？
Finally starting to wonder about my life, huh?

378
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,120
难道那不就是为什么她这么轻易给我们钱吗？
Isn't that why she gave us the money so easily?

379
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:04,460
她可能看起来简单，但她是个很杰出的女商人
She may seem naive but she's a prominent business woman.

380
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,960
她对钱很在乎的
She's very careful with her money.

381
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,160
她不会因为点爱就给别人钱的
She wouldn't give it out for being tangled in some love affair.

382
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,040
那她为什么要给钱？
Then why'd she do it?

383
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,670
或许是因为她相信我吧？
Probably 'cuz she trusts me?

384
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,380
你可以不信
You may laugh.

385
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,670
但我是个相当可靠的人，知道吗？
But I'm a pretty reliable guy, you know?

386
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,840
一个卷跑我的钱的可靠人？
A reliable guy who ran with my money?

387
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,550
嗨，我现在正在努力还你钱呢
Hey, I'm trying hard to pay you back, now.

388
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:31,750
我从她那拿到钱，因为我就是担保品
I got the money from her 'cuz I'm the collateral.

389
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:35,300
从现在起她要我做什么，我都得做
I have to do anything she asks from now on.

390
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,920
这么说，她要你和她睡觉，你也得干吗？
So you'll sleep with her if she wants you to?

391
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:44,710
你说的好像那是世上最糟糕的事似的
You're talking like that's the worst thing in the world.

392
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,210
- 你认为那很正常吗？ - 这取决于你怎么看了
- You think that's normal?  - Depends on how you look at it.

393
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:49,620
要是你觉着没啥，就没啥
If you think it's good, it's good.

394
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,210
要是你觉着很糟糕，那就很糟糕
If you think it's bad, then it's bad.

395
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,840
什么事对你来说都这么简单吗？
Everything's that simple to you?

396
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,370
简单点好
Simplicity is good.

397
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,080
我们是在给你讨债呀！
We retrieve unpaid debts for you!

398
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
这么说，你对我和她的关系感兴趣了，嗯？
So you're curious of my relationship with her, huh?

399
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,460
什么？
What?

400
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,870
想听的话，我可以多说点给你听
I can tell you more, if you want.

401
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,880
不用了，谢谢
No, thanks.

402
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,370
说实话
Be honest.

403
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:42,960
我不那么好奇，我一点都不想听
I'm so not curious. I don't need to hear any of it.

404
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:52,460
我为什么要关心你和女人那些事
Why would I care what you go around doing with women.

405
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,000
你一点都没变
You haven't changed one bit.

406
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,420
我看起来没变，是吗？
I still look the same, right?

407
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,840
我说三十多了，大家都不相信
People don't believe me when I say I'm over 30.

408
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,630
也还是这么浮躁
Still pompous, too.

409
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,420
别这么说
Come on.

410
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,710
要是我有什么变化，你会失望的
You'd be disappointed if I was any different.

411
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,580
喂？
Hello?

412
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,500
找秉云吗？
Oh, Byung-woon?

413
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,790
请稍等
Hold on, please.

414
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:13,460
嗨！秉云
Hey! Byung...

415
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,960
他不能马上接电话
He can't come to the phone right now.

416
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,960
请再说一遍
Pardon?

417
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:28,340
朴世美？
PARK Se-mi?

418
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,160
好的，再见
Okay, bye.

419
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,040
嗨，妈妈
Hi, mom.

420
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:57,120
我有点忙
I'm a little busy.

421
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,910
我不需要更多的泡菜了，我几乎从不在家吃饭
I don't need any more Kimchi. I hardly ever eat at home.

422
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,920
好的，妈妈
Yes, mom.

423
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,210
我会好好吃饭的，别担心
I'm eating well. Don't worry.

424
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,210
什么？
What?

425
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,290
好的
Okay.

426
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,460
我得走了，妈妈，以后打电话给你
I gotta go, mom. I'll call you later.

427
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,080
是你妈妈吗？
Was it your mom?

428
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,170
- 为什么不把电话给我？ - 为什么给你？
- Why didn't you put me on?  - Why?

429
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:51,050
这样我就能打个招呼
So I can say, hi.

430
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:57,260
- 她身体好吗？ - 很好，事怎么样了？
- How's her health?  - Good. How'd it go?

431
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,750
她膝盖不好，现在好点了吗？
She had a bad knee. Is it better, now?

432
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:02,250
用不着你担心
No need for you to worry.

433
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,670
你拿到钱了吗？
Did you get the money?

434
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:09,170
咱们再去别处看看吧，反正我也没期待太多
Let's check elsewhere. I didn't expect much, anyway.

435
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,670
你的众多女友不是总帮忙吗？
Your many girlfriends don't always help?

436
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,870
- 她是一个学校朋友，我发誓  - 随便吧
- She's a friend from school, I swear.  - Whatever.

437
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,670
小学同班
Same class, elementary school.

438
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:20,870
她离婚了，努力工作独自抚养女儿
She got divorced and is working hard to raise her daughter alone.

439
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,500
那现在你是在利用努力工作的单身母亲吗？
So now you're using hard-working single mothers?

440
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,790
别这么说
Aw, come on.

441
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:32,410
我本以为她情况好点了，但我想是没有
I thought things got better for her but I guess not.

442
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,630
全世界都在苦苦挣扎呀
The whole world's struggling.

443
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:37,210
我恨这个世界
I hate this world.

444
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,920
又来了，你太悲观了
There you go again being pessimistic.

445
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,840
- 你为什么这么…  - 认识一个叫朴世美的吗？
- Why are you so...  - Know someone named PARK Se-mi?

446
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,210
世美？哦，是她呀
Se-mi? Oh, her.

447
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,920
- 为什么问这个？ - 她打电话了
- Why?  - She called.

448
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,550
再把你的手机给我
Give me your phone, again.

449
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:14,380
目的地已抵达
You have arrived at your destination.

450
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,950
哪栋楼呀？
Which building is it?

451
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,170
就应该在这附近了
It should be around here.

452
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:23,380
我告诉你直走而不是右转，现在我们迷路了
I told you to go straight, not turn right. Now we're lost.

453
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,290
导航说右转
The navigator said to turn right.

454
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:29,500
这些玩意不总是对的，它也是人造的机器
These things aren't always right. It's just a man-made machine.

455
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,590
它可比某些人更可靠
It's more reliable than some people.

456
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,790
- 找到了  - 真的？
- Found it.  - Really?

457
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,080
我认为就是这栋
I think it's this one.

458
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,870
她肯定挣了很多钱
Man, she must've made a lot of money.

459
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,420
我猜经济不景气没影响到干这行的姑娘
Guess the economy doesn't affect the girls in this biz.

460
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,630
我就在你楼外呢
I'm just outside your building.

461
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,960
一路畅通
It was clear roads all the way.

462
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,710
真的？
Really?

463
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,500
好的，那慢慢洗漱吧
It's okay, wash up slowly then.

464
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,710
再见
Bye.

465
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:12,250
她说过一小会再来
She said to come back a little later.

466
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:18,050
等着的时候，你想做些什么？
What do you want to do while we wait?

467
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:23,040
我可没整天时间，现在快去，我在这等着
I don't have all day. Just go now, I'll wait here.

468
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,840
她刚醒，我得给她洗漱时间
She just woke up. I should give her time to wash-up.

469
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,460
又不是约会！
It's not a date!

470
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:29,840
谁在乎呀
Who cares.

471
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,000
咱们就等三十分钟
Let's just wait for 30 more minutes.

472
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:36,880
她上夜班，对她来说早起很困难
She works nights. It's hard for her to get up early.

473
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,170
当我保证你能拿到钱，好吗？
But I promise you'll get the money, okay?

474
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,500
你难道不饿吗？我们去吃午饭吧
Aren't you hungry? Let's go for lunch.

475
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,710
我们最喜欢的饭馆，难道不就在这附近吗？
Isn't our favorite restaurant around here?

476
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,380
叫什么名来着？
What was the name?

477
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,710
济州屋
Je-ju House.

478
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,420
没错！记得那的带鱼吗？
Right! Remember the cutlass fish?

479
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:05,800
老板很喜欢你，因为你老是会要第二份
The owner used to love you 'cuz you'd always have seconds.

480
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,920
我没有！
I did not!

481
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,580
你有
You did.

482
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,170
我不记得了
I don't remember.

483
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,830
怎么了？
What?

484
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,540
没什么
Nothing.

485
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:51,950
不能相信饭馆没了
I can't believe the restaurant's gone.

486
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:55,000
就是我们运气不好
Just our luck.

487
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,000
你认为它倒闭了吗？
Think it went out of business?

488
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:11,340
我不记得看到过很多顾客
I don't remember seeing many customers.

489
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:15,420
老板很好，也很慷慨
The owner used to be so nice and giving.

490
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,380
希望她还好
Hope she's doing well.

491
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,210
现在我们吃什么？
Now what do we eat?

492
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:28,910
咱们去吃点好吃的辣东西吧
Let's go grab something good and spicy.

493
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,790
从带鱼掉到了汉堡包
From cutlass fish down to hamburgers.

494
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,300
你知道我正餐时间是不吃汉堡的
You know I don't eat burgers at mealtimes.

495
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:46,790
我不认为那是吃饭
It's not my idea of a meal.

496
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,250
那就像方便面一样
It's like instant noodles.

497
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,960
这不是饭
This isn't a meal.

498
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,670
更像点心
It's more like a snack.

499
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,540
那就别吃
Then don't eat.

500
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,170
- 你要点餐吗？ - 一个香辣鸡腿堡套餐
- May I take your order?  - One Zinger Burger set, please.

501
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:05,370
- 喝什么？ - 可乐
- And your drink with that?  - Coke, please.

502
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,750
就这么多吗？
Will that be all?

503
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,880
不，我要个麦辣鸡翅汉堡套餐
No, I'll have the Spicy Burger set.

504
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,670
我要切成两半，把薯条换成饼干
I'd like it cut in half and a biscuit instead of fries.

505
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:17,750
还要柠檬和一些玉米沙拉
I'll have a lemonade and some corn salad, too.

506
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:20,120
- 在这吃还是带走？ - 在这吃
- For here or to go?  - Here.

507
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:25,000
总共是一万零九百块
Your total comes to $10.90, please.

508
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,130
我给你把切刀
I'll give you a cutting knife.

509
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:30,210
我只付我的那份
I'll just pay for my order, please.

510
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,620
好的
Okay...

511
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,910
找你的钱
Here's your change.

512
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,420
那个有优惠券送吗？
Do I get a coupon with that?

513
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,710
- 什么？ - 没什么
- What?  - Nothing.

514
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,790
给我尝尝，好吗？
Let me eat, will you?

515
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:24,210
想把汉堡分着吃吗？
Wanna split our burgers?

516
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,290
不
No.

517
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,670
还是不喜欢分东西给别人吃，嗯？
Still don't like sharing food, huh?

518
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,750
- 从我们在一起时就这样…  - 怎么了？
- Since we're together like this...  - What now?

519
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,960
没事
Nothing.

520
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:51,670
让我想起了过去的一些事
Brings back old memories.

521
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:53,540
很甜蜜，是吧？
It's nice, right?

522
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:57,250
该死
Damn it.

523
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:11,040
我是赵秉云
CHO Byung-woon speaking.

524
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,260
你在哪呢？
Where are you?

525
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:17,630
我在附近
I'm nearby.

526
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,750
是的
Yeah.

527
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:25,710
你能那样过来吗？
Can you go around like that?

528
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:27,910
真的吗？
Really?

529
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,000
对
Yes.

530
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,500
不是我不爱你了
It's not that I don't love you.

531
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:55,290
我只是不能再这么做了
I just can't do this anymore.

532
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:01,710
他？
Him?

533
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,880
他对我一直很好
He's always good to me.

534
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,840
谢谢理解
Thanks for understanding.

535
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:16,750
还要…
And...

536
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,250
对不起
I'm sorry.

537
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,410
嗨，好的
Hi, there.

538
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:50,210
请付1000块
$1, please.

539
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:52,000
- 稍等  - 好的
- Wait.  - Sure.

540
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:00,840
- 我还要这个  - 好的
- I'll take this, too.  - Okay.

541
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:06,420
请付1600块，谢谢
$1.60, please. Thank you.

542
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,460
你去哪了？我到处找你
Where'd you go? I looked everywhere.

543
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,870
我还以为你走了呢
I thought you left.

544
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:34,880
我为什么要走？
Why would I?

545
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,500
我的汉堡只吃了一半，你为什么要把它扔了？
I only ate half the burger. Why'd you throw it out?

546
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,370
你看起来很忙呀
You looked pretty busy.

547
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,380
要走了吗？
Leaving already?

548
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,260
再见，先生
See you around, sir.

549
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:50,040
- 再见  - 祝你好运！
- Bye.  - Good luck!

550
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,380
再次感谢，售票工作顺利！
Thanks again. And have fun giving out tickets!

551
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:56,960
先生？
Sir?

552
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,750
饶了我吧
Give me a break.

553
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:00,660
这是十万
Here's $100.

554
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,790
你从哪弄的？
Where'd you get this?

555
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:06,370
我当滑雪教练时，教过其中一个女孩
I taught one of the girls when I was a ski instructor.

556
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,170
现在向学生下手了？
Now, a student?

557
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:11,250
都长大了，爱帮助别人了，这让我很骄傲
All grown up and helping people out. Makes me proud.

558
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:14,750
- 和学生借钱吗？ - 那怎么了？
- For borrowing money from students?  - What's wrong with that?

559
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:18,830
没钱时，和别人借点，有钱时，借点给别人
When you're low, you borrow. When you're not, you give.

560
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,540
- 生活就是这样的  - 随你怎么说吧
- It's all a part of life.  - Whatever you say.

561
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,510
你借过钱给我，是不是？
You lent me money, didn't you?

562
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,910
你到底为什么借呢？
Why did you, anyway?

563
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:34,420
你说事很紧急，你的生意有危险
You said it was urgent. That your business was at risk!

564
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:38,920
不是因为你觉着有愧于我吗？
It wasn't 'cuz you felt sorry?

565
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,050
什么？
What?

566
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:42,130
那难道不是你说过的吗？
Isn't that what you said?

567
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:44,410
真不敢相信你说这话
I don't believe this.

568
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:46,630
或许是我听错了
Maybe I heard wrong.

569
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,830
随便吧
Anyways.

570
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,210
- 给  - 哇，谢谢！
- Here.  - Wow, thanks!

571
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:56,170
喝饮料或许能让你闭上嘴
Sucking on that should keep you quiet.

572
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:59,170
你还记得我喜欢罐装咖啡？
You remembered I like canned coffee?

573
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:04,790
不明白为什么人们喜欢黑咖啡和浓缩咖啡
I don't get why people drink black coffee or espressos.

574
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:08,500
罐装咖啡食用方便，味道香甜
Canned coffees are simple and sweet.

575
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,790
你难道不这么认为吗？
Don't you think?

576
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:45,960
喂？
Hello?

577
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,840
嗯
Yeah.

578
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:50,460
什么？
What?

579
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,960
我为什么要这样？
Why should I?

580
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,920
这没道理
This doesn't make any sense.

581
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:11,250
那她真是奇怪
Then she's really weird.

582
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:29,630
进来
Come in.

583
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:51,210
想来点绿茶吗？
Want some green tea?

584
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:01,790
我真的必须这么做吗？
Do I really have to do this?

585
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:04,460
她说她想先见见你
She says she wants to see you first.

586
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:06,000
这次你说了什么？
What did you say this time?

587
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,670
没什么，就说你在外边等着
Nothing. Just that you're waiting outside.

588
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:13,040
或许就是想打个招呼，请坐
Probably just wants to say hi. Sit down.

589
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:16,450
这个地方难道不是很棒吗？
Isn't this place, awesome?

590
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,870
世美
Se-mi.

591
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:24,960
- 这是喜秀，这是世美  - 这是什么？
- This is Hee-su and this is Se-mi.  - What's this?

592
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,750
- 给我拿点啤酒加冰  - 好的好的
- Beer in ice, For me.  - Right, Right, right.

593
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:38,120
请坐
Have a seat.

594
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,290
能问一下你为什么要见我吗？
May I ask why you wanted to see me?

595
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:11,540
不为什么
No reason.

596
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,580
- 要很多泡吗，世美？ - 是的
- Lots of foam, Se-mi?  - Yes, please.

597
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,790
给
Here.

598
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:31,380
- 谢谢  - 不客气
- Thank you.  - My pleasure.

599
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,710
我只是想看看你是谁
I just wanted to see who you were.

600
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:52,670
但我想我可能预期过高了
But I guess I had pretty high expectations.

601
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:55,250
请见谅
I beg your pardon?

602
00:50:57,410 --> 00:50:59,590
你太普通了
You're so average.

603
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:04,130
我本以为你很特殊
I imagined you'd be something special.

604
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,160
超级漂亮
Stunningly beautiful.

605
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,630
至少也是很优雅美丽
Or overly elegant and classy.

606
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:17,050
因为秉云说，你们俩曾那么亲密
Since Byung-woon said you two were close that is.

607
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,960
别开玩笑了，世美
Stop kidding around, Se-mi.

608
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:24,710
我是说真的，那样才配得上你
I'm serious. You deserve that much.

609
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,540
她完全配不上你
You're way over her league.

610
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:31,040
她喜欢开玩笑
She loves to kid around.

611
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:35,910
你过去非常喜欢他，是吧？
You used to like him a lot, right?

612
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:40,540
难道那不就是你借钱给他的原因吗？
Isn't that why you lent him the money?

613
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:45,290
如果是那样的话，你为什么还要向他追债？
If you did, why are you hounding him?

614
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:48,420
要是我是你，我会直接把钱送给他
If I were you, I would've just given it to him.

615
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,920
世美，别说了
Se-mi, please.

616
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,120
你屁都不知道！怎么这么放肆！
You don't know anything! How dare you!

617
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:58,710
- 喜秀，坐下…  - 闭嘴！什么破事！
- Hee-su, let's sit down and...  - Shut up! What is this!

618
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:01,300
我为什么必须听她这么说？
Why do I have to listen to that?

619
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,710
都是因为你！
It's all because of you!

620
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:08,580
你都等了一年了，难道就不能再稍微多等会吗？
If you waited for a year, couldn't you wait a little longer?

621
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:13,500
想过这么突然和他要钱，他有多难吗？
Ever think how hard it's on him asking for money out of the blue?

622
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,790
你一定要这么折腾他吗？
Must you put him through that shit?

623
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:17,300
什么？
What?

624
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:20,620
那他折腾我呢？
What about the shit he put me in?

625
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:23,590
世美！喜秀目前有困难
Se-mi! Hee-su has it rough these days.

626
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,960
秉云！别和个天使似的！
Byung-woon! Stop acting like an angel!

627
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:32,960
为点破钱吵架，真没劲
Bickering over a few lousy bucks. So lame.

628
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:38,840
对你这种赚快钱的女人而言
For girls like you who make easy money...

629
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,380
三百五十万可能不多，但对我可不一样！
$3500 may not be much. But it is for me!

630
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,960
别装优雅了！你不就是个酒吧女吗！
Stop acting classy! You're nothing but a bargirl!

631
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,380
哦！哎呀！
Oh! Geeze!

632
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,370
你们俩扯太远了
You're both taking it too far.

633
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:05,210
我想你说得对
Guess you're right.

634
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,580
我不是什么你说的优雅的人
I'm not what you'd call classy.

635
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,710
非常对不起，二位
I'm so sorry to both of you.

636
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:14,790
都是因为我，非常对不起
This is all 'cuz of me. I'm so sorry.

637
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,710
骂我吧，姑娘们，好吗？
Just yell at me, girls. Please?

638
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:21,630
是我的错，我应该跪求原谅
It's my fault. I'll kneel for forgiveness.

639
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:25,620
- 喜秀，对不起  - 咱们走！
- Hee-su, I'm sorry.  - Let go!

640
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:26,840
对不起
Sorry.

641
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:30,410
世美，请你…
Se-mi, please...

642
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:39,920
你这是在干什么？
What are you doing?

643
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:42,300
起来
Get up.

644
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,590
对不起，夫人
I'm sorry, lady.

645
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:58,660
我肯定是脑子出问题了
I must've lost it or something.

646
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,500
我有点故意态度不好
I was kinda rude on purpose.

647
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:07,210
我是有点无礼，大家都知道
I'm known to be a little saucy.

648
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:10,050
看到没？我知道她是在开玩笑
See? I knew she was kidding.

649
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,540
这才是我认识的世美
Now that's the Se-mi, I know.

650
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:16,380
- 这是恭维吗？ - 当然了
- Is that a compliment?  - Of course.

651
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,090
随你怎么说吧
Whatever you say.

652
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,340
你好？
Hello?

653
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:40,540
- 要喝绿茶吗，喜秀？ - 他是谁？
- Want some green tea, Hee-su?  - Who's this?

654
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,910
嗨，亲爱的
Hi, honey.

655
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:50,500
就在家当乖女孩呢
Just being a good girl at home.

656
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,210
我这有人
I have someone over.

657
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,790
好的，我会打电话给你
Okay, I'll call you.

658
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:28,380
忘了我刚才说的话吧
Ah, forget what I said earlier and...

659
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:29,660
嗨，女士
Hey, lady.

660
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:33,510
别在意
Don't sweat it.

661
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,410
这是七十万
Here's $700.

662
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:47,500
- 哥哥，你不用打扫  - 小会就好
- You don't have to clean that up.  - It'll just take a sec.

663
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,840
现在的姑娘都像模特
Girls these days are like models.

664
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:56,120
一定是注意饮食了
Must be somethin' in the food.

665
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,630
有什么不对吗？
What's wrong?

666
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,250
奇怪我和世美的关系，是吗？
Wondering about my relationship with Se-mi, are you?

667
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,750
别伤心
Don't get upset.

668
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:11,040
我一直受女士欢迎
I was always popular with the ladies.

669
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,460
- 但不是你想的那样  - 不是那样
- But it's not what you think.  - It's not that.

670
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,460
那是哪样？
Then what is it?

671
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,750
我明白了
I get it.

672
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:23,540
什么？
What?

673
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:26,540
看起来你没怎么变
Looks like you haven't changed much.

674
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:30,340
你刀子嘴豆腐心
You act tough but you're a softy in heart.

675
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:32,790
你可不了解我
You don't know me.

676
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:38,210
别担心，她不会被你的话伤着的
Don't worry. She didn't get hurt by what you said.

677
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:39,920
你怎么知道她的感受？
How do you know how she feels?

678
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:45,420
她经历过很多，她是个坚强的女孩
She's been through a lot in life. She's a tough girl.

679
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:49,620
那不表示她的感情从不会被伤害
That doesn't mean her feelings will never get hurt.

680
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:54,050
我的意思只是她已经习惯了
I just meant she's used to it.

681
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,870
你怎么能这么说？
How can you say that?

682
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,790
我说什么了？
What did I say?

683
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:09,000
你是谁，你怎么知道她是受到了伤害没有？
Who are you to judge whether her feelings were hurt or not?

684
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,210
这没什么可吵的
It's nothing to argue about.

685
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:15,750
你可曾伤过心吗？
Have you ever had your feelings hurt?

686
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:17,590
你知道那是什么感觉吗？
Do you know what it's like?

687
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:21,090
你的鞋带开了，肯定有人想你了
Your laces are undone. Someone must be thinking of you.

688
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,500
- 别弄了  - 别动
- Leave it.  - Hold still.

689
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:28,960
你是对的，我从未那么伤心过
You're right. I've never been that hurt.

690
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:32,460
但或许有一点点伤心
But maybe just a little.

691
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:35,260
就在你说你想分手之后
After you said you wanted to break up.

692
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,950
我永远忘不了你脸上的表情
I could never forget the look on your face.

693
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,170
那表情很奇怪
It was strange.

694
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:46,660
我以前从未见过
I haven't seen it before.

695
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,090
但你看起来…
But you looked...

696
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:51,660
真的很高兴
Really happy.

697
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,290
我认为你和我在一起很高兴
I thought you were happy with me

698
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:56,410
但我们分手时你看起来更高兴
but you looked happier when we broke up.

699
00:57:57,790 --> 00:57:59,630
那种感觉闪了一下
I'd get flashes of that.

700
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,710
感到有点伤心
And felt kinda hurt.

701
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:16,710
你好
Hello?

702
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,210
嗨
Oh, hi.

703
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:24,920
就是去办点事
Just going around on business.

704
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:27,340
是的
Yes.

705
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:30,130
你确定吗？
Are you sure?

706
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:33,460
非常感谢
Thanks a lot.

707
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:38,160
你是最棒的，谢谢了
You're the best. Thanks.

708
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,460
秉…云吗？
Byung-woon?

709
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:41,590
咦？
Huh?

710
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,380
我一会给你回电话
I'll call you right back.

711
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,670
嗨
Hey.

712
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:47,380
- 你在这干什么？ - 顺便路过
- What are you doing here?  - Just stopping by.

713
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,670
你住在这吗？
Do you live here?

714
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:50,080
我公婆住这
My in-laws live here.

715
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,670
哦
Oh.

716
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,000
你来参加过我们的婚礼，对吧？
You came to our wedding, right?

717
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,000
- 你记得我吗？ - 当然了
- You remember Me?  - Of course.

718
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,170
我们在迎宾处打赌，看谁喝米酒最多
We bet who could drink the most rice wine at the reception.

719
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:01,580
你就记得这个呀
That's some memory you got there.

720
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:08,460
他在厕所吐了一宿，差点死了
He almost died throwing up at the toilet all night long.

721
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:10,750
- 你们还要去别的地方吗？ - 是的
- Are you on your way somewhere?  - Yes.

722
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:14,460
咱们为什么不喝一杯呢？
Why don't we grab a quick drink?

723
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:18,450
对不起，我们得去和别人碰面
Sorry, but we have to meet someone.

724
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:24,410
十分钟就成了，这的咖啡很不错
Just 10 minutes, then. The cafe here is nice.

725
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:27,620
是呀，就一小会
Yeah, just for a while.

726
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:31,540
下次吧，红珠
Maybe next time, Hong-ju.

727
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,870
你要喝点什么？
What would you like to drink?

728
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,710
我喝咖啡，速溶的，多加糖和奶
I'll have coffee, instant style, with lots of sugar and milk, please.

729
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,540
好的
Okay.

730
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,210
你来绿茶吗？
Green tea for you?

731
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:51,750
好的，我要绿茶
Yes, I'll have green tea.

732
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:55,550
咱们喝啤酒吧，今天是周六，来扎啤
Let's drink beer. It's Saturday. Draft beers, please.

733
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:58,460
您点的马上就来
I'll be right back with your order.

734
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,290
嗯，爸爸？
Yes, pops?

735
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:08,630
是
Yeah.

736
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:10,330
你近来怎么样？
How've you been?

737
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:13,790
我听说不太好呀
I heard things weren't good.

738
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:16,670
怎么能老是好呢
Well, it can't always be good.

739
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:21,290
真的吗？我碰上了红珠的一些朋友
Really? I met some of Hong-ju's friends.

740
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,710
我真喜欢你的打扮
I really like your style.

741
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:30,300
我们点了啤酒
We ordered beer.

742
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:33,500
简约而又知性
Moderate and intellectual.

743
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:36,290
得了，爸爸
Aw come on, pops.

744
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:41,000
知道吗？他在学校很出名
You know? He was famous in school for

745
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,880
因为对女人很有品味
having high standards in women.

746
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:46,090
这是恭维，是吧？
It's a compliment, right?

747
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:48,160
当然了
Of course.

748
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:02,670
来了
Here it comes.

749
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,250
给
Here.

750
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:13,660
谢谢
Thank you.

751
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:15,290
碰杯
Shall we?

752
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,210
你经营一家木材公司，是吧？
You ran a lumber company, right?

753
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:42,920
不干了，现在我在找人投资新商业计划
Not anymore. I'm now looking for investors to a new business plan.

754
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,630
嗯
Okay...

755
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:48,210
- 服务员  - 你好
- Waitress?  - Yes?

756
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:49,920
再来一杯啤酒
Another beer, please.

757
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:52,620
什么生意？
What business?

758
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:55,500
关于国际餐饮业的
Sort of an international restaurant business.

759
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:58,920
你过去和我老婆约会过，是吧？
You used to date my wife, right?

760
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:06,090
大熙，别说了
Dae-hee, please.

761
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,880
有一次她喝的酩酊大醉，不停地念叨你
Once when she got really drunk, she rambled on about you.

762
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:12,160
她可能记不得了
Probably doesn't even remember.

763
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,880
所以我想见见你，问问你
So I wanted to meet you and ask you.

764
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,290
大学的时候
We were just in

765
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:19,380
我们只是在同一个马术俱乐部而已
horseback riding club together in college.

766
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,000
- 对吧，红珠？ - 没错
- Right, Hong-ju?  - Right.

767
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:26,210
- 我初学，而你是资深会员  - 对
- I was a freshman and you're a senior.  - Right.

768
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:30,160
但你说过他是你的初恋
But you said he was your first love.

769
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:35,460
嗯，大学的时候…你也知道…
Well, back in college... You know...

770
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:38,170
我们是那种非常亲近的朋友
We were sort of close friends.

771
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:39,880
是的
Right.

772
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,370
亲近到睡到一起吗？
Close enough to sleep together?

773
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:00,540
只是问问而已吗
Just asking.

774
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,330
谢谢
Thank you.

775
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:05,420
你难道不去追她吗？
Shouldn't you go after her?

776
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:07,210
她会马上回来的
She'll be right back.

777
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,840
- 干杯  - 好的
- Drink up.  - Sure.

778
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:18,630
她来了
Here she comes.

779
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,330
我应该点些吃的吗？
Should I order some food?

780
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:26,620
有什么你想吃的吗？
Anything you want to eat?

781
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,630
点点东西，喜秀
Pick something, Hee-su.

782
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:36,080
对不起
I'm sorry.

783
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:41,090
再这么做，我会杀了你
Do that again and I'll kill you.

784
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,500
好的，喝酒
Okay. Have a drink.

785
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:31,160
谢谢
Thank you.

786
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:34,040
喝的头疼
Damn hangover.

787
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,670
你为什么喝那么多？
Why'd you drink so much?

788
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:38,660
我能怎么说，说不吗？
How can I say, no?

789
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:40,960
至少我们弄到了三十万
At least we got $300.

790
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:44,340
和陌生人借钱，你真有本事
Borrowing money from strangers. You're something.

791
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:48,750
大家说我都能把空调卖到北极去
People say I could probably sell air conditioners in the North Pole.

792
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:53,080
生存高手，但是个骗子，骗人的餐饮业…
A survivor but a liar. Phony restaurant business...

793
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:56,500
- 我可没说谎，想听听吗？ - 不想
- I wasn't lying. Wanna hear it?  - No.

794
01:04:58,540 --> 01:04:59,790
你的电话响了
Your phone's ringing.

795
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:01,920
或许又是我的
It's probably for me, again.

796
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:04,000
你好？
Hello?

797
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,290
- 你后座的包  - 嗯？
- Your bag in The back.  - Yeah?

798
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:24,620
你为什么随身带着这么大的东西？
Why do you carry around such a big thing?

799
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:27,420
我一直住在一个朋友那
I was staying at a friend's place.

800
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:30,590
他兄弟从部队回来了，所以我就搬出来了
His brother got back from the army so I moved out.

801
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:34,580
- 这么说你无家可归？ - 对
- So you're homeless?  - Yup.

802
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:38,080
我有点缺钱，所以我卖了房子
I was a little short on cash, so I sold my place.

803
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,800
你仍旧玩赛马
And you still hang around race-tracks.

804
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:49,040
不是赌钱，过去赌过，但现在不了
It's not to make money. I used to, but it's not that anymore.

805
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:51,250
那你为什么去那？
Then why do you go there?

806
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:56,250
记得我梦想成为骑手吗？
Remember my dream of becoming a jockey?

807
01:05:56,370 --> 01:06:02,250
要不是我这么大个，没准我就成了呢
If I didn't get so big, I probably would've made it.

808
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:06,160
我被迫放弃了梦想，但我仍旧喜欢去那
I had to give up my dream but I still love being there.

809
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:08,460
看着骑手骑着马
Watching the jockeys riding the horses

810
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:10,460
让我心情激动
makes my heart jump.

811
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:28,210
你为什么停车？
Why are you stopping?

812
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:32,910
咱们算了吧
Let's drop it.

813
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:35,130
你什么意思？
What do you mean?

814
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:37,290
咱们就这分开吧
Let's just split up here.

815
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:41,620
你疯了吗？这次又是那出？
Are you mad again? What is it this time?

816
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:45,120
事情不是那样的
It's not that.

817
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:51,130
我没法再干了
I can't do this.

818
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:52,250
那钱怎么办？
Then what about the money?

819
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:55,420
- 我们都快到了  - 就电汇给我吧
- We're almost there.  - Just wire it into my account.

820
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:58,750
既然开始了就去拿钱吧
Take the money while we're on it.

821
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:02,080
我想今天全部还你
I want to give it all to you today.

822
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,080
先这样吧，算了吧
Forget it. Just drop it.

823
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,870
你来真的是为钱吗？
Did you really come For The money?

824
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
你什么意思？
What do you mean?

825
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:13,090
很奇怪，你那么想要你的钱
It's strange how you wanted your money

826
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,800
现在又突然不了
and now you suddenly don't.

827
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,370
肯定有别的原因
There's gotta be another reason.

828
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:21,090
什么原因？
Like what?

829
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:24,870
比方说你想念我？
Like you missed me?

830
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:28,250
你饶了我吧
Give me a break.

831
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:32,290
在前边的路口左转
Turn left at the intersection ahead.

832
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:35,090
听到了吗？咱们走吧
Hear that? Let's go.

833
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,670
我说过，不！
I said, no!

834
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:41,750
西班牙人和韩国人有许多共同点
Spaniards and Koreans have many things in common.

835
01:07:41,870 --> 01:07:44,920
例如整晚开派对，饮酒
Like partying all night, drinking.

836
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:48,130
脾气有点急躁
And being a little quick tempered.

837
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:49,540
还有…
And...

838
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:52,750
加点满天星怎么样？
How about adding some baby's breath to that?

839
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:55,750
马蹄莲配鸢尾花更好
Callas go better with irises.

840
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:59,450
多加一万块，我可以加些鸢尾花
I can mix in some irises for $10 more.

841
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:02,330
- 不用了，就这样吧  - 好的
- No, that's fine.  - Okay.

842
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:05,130
马蹄莲本身就很好看
The callas look beautiful as they are.

843
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:08,040
西班牙人口味也类似
Spaniards also have similar tastes.

844
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,920
他们和我们一样，喜欢咸辣食物，吃米饭
They like spicy and salty foods and eat rice like us.

845
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:16,340
他们的什锦饭有点像我们的泡菜炒饭
Their Paella is kinda like our Kimchi fried rice.

846
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:20,500
所以我认为米酒在西班牙也会畅销
So I think rice wine will do well in Spain.

847
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:22,210
在马德里的中心开家米酒俱乐部
A rice wine pub in the heart of Madrid.

848
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:25,130
听起来很棒，对吧？
Sounds sweet, huh?

849
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:30,630
招牌上写“高档米酒，来自韩国”
The sign will say, 'High Quality Rice Wine from Korea.'

850
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,840
我顺便也卖泡菜和泡菜饼
And I'll sell Kimchi and Korean pancakes to go along.

851
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:35,670
成，随你便
Sure. Whatever.

852
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:38,510
这难道不是很棒吗？想一起做生意吗？
Isn't it great? Wanna go in business together?

853
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:41,590
不，我没你有梦想
No. I'm no dreamer like you.

854
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:44,080
在西班牙开家米酒俱乐部，主意真棒
A rice wine pub in Spain. Great idea.

855
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:45,290
难道不是吗？
Isn't it?

856
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:47,410
看到没？大家都认为那是个好主意
See? Everyone thinks it's a great idea.

857
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:51,290
这是肯定的，我可以告诉你
It's a sure thing, I tell 'ya.

858
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:56,080
闻闻这个，喜秀
Smell this, Hee-su.

859
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:57,920
不
No.

860
01:08:58,450 --> 01:08:59,920
很好闻
It's good.

861
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:03,960
谢谢
Thank you.

862
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:05,460
谢谢，喜秀
Thanks, Hee-su.

863
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:11,540
- 你什么时候去过西班牙？ - 我很快就会去的
- When did you visit Spain?  - I'll go someday soon.

864
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:29,250
哇！酷！
Wow! Cool!

865
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:32,040
我们必须得总像这样碰面吗？
Must we always meet, like this?

866
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,460
你为什么去杨平？
Why were you in Yang-pyung?

867
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:34,960
买点猪排
To buy some pork chops.

868
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,960
对，杨平的牛排是最棒的！
Right, Yang-pyung pork chops are the best!

869
01:09:38,790 --> 01:09:41,340
- 好久不见了  - 嗨
- Long time no see.  - Hi.

870
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,250
把这个替我给你夫人
Give this to your wife, for me.

871
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:46,500
- 和我来取钱吧  - 好的
- Come with me to get the money.  - Oh, okay.

872
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,550
上来吧
Come on up.

873
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:10,040
你也来吧，喜秀
You too, Hee-su.

874
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:11,710
这难道不是很棒吗？
Isn't this nice?

875
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:15,710
- 多少钱？ - 很贵
- How much was it?  - Pretty expensive.

876
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:21,210
- 我们马上就出来，好吗？ - 当然了
- We're coming right out, right?  - Of course.

877
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:24,210
- 稍微吃点之后  - 这不是野餐
- After a quick bite.  - This isn't a picnic.

878
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:27,380
如果你有啤酒和猪排，这就是野餐
It's a picnic if you got beer and pork chops.

879
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:30,090
刚才我只吃了半个汉堡
I only had half the hamburger before.

880
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,670
就吃一块猪排，我们就马上出来
Just one pork chop and we'll be right out.

881
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:35,170
小心楼梯
Watch the stairs.

882
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:41,590
- 你吃饱了吗？ - 嗨，那边
- Did you get enough to eat?  - Hi, there.

883
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,010
小心楼梯
Watch the stairs.

884
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,870
你骑着摩托车看起来很棒，哥们
The bike looks good on you, man.

885
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:55,370
我想卖了这个旧地方，但我老婆喜欢这
I wanna sell this old place but the wife likes it.

886
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:59,080
太棒了！风景真好
It's great! You have an awesome view.

887
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,710
进来吧
Come on in.

888
01:11:25,870 --> 01:11:27,840
你什么时候建的这？酷！
When did you build this? Cool!

889
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,500
花了整一个星期
This took a whole week.

890
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,340
亲爱的，醒醒
Hon? Wake up.

891
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,330
我也来了
I'm here, too.

892
01:11:35,950 --> 01:11:37,550
嗨，秉云
Hi, Byung-woon.

893
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:39,540
生日快乐！
Happy birthday!

894
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:41,040
谢谢
Thank you.

895
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,260
你为什么喝这么多？
Why'd you drink so much?

896
01:11:43,790 --> 01:11:46,630
姑娘们把我灌的
The girls put me up to it.

897
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:48,590
我没办法
I had no choice.

898
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,000
进来，喜秀
Come in, Hee-su.

899
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,290
- 不了，我就在这等着吧  - 进来吧
- No, I'll just wait here.  - Come on in.

900
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:56,460
你还要举办展览吗？
Are you holding another exhibition?

901
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:59,000
- 下个月  - 真的？
- Next month.  - Really?

902
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,000
你们曾经在一起，是吧？
You came together once, right?

903
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,870
- 是的  - 没错
- Yes.  - That's right.

904
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:06,370
- 你好  - 嗨
- Hello.  - Hi.

905
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:10,290
- 这还真干净呀  - 啤酒是热的，亲爱的
- Lots of neat stuff Here.  - The beer's hot, hon.

906
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:12,010
给我来个凉的
Get me a cold one.

907
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:14,710
好的
Okay.

908
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,790
这的啤酒都没了
The beer's all gone here.

909
01:12:22,450 --> 01:12:23,800
- 秉云  - 嗯
- Byung-woon?  - Yeah?

910
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:25,800
- 出去烧烤吧  - 好的
- Go out and barbecue.  - Sure.

911
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,840
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

912
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:45,040
谢谢，但不是什么大事
Thanks, but it's no big deal.

913
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:55,260
你是水瓶座的吗？
Are you an Aquarius?

914
01:12:58,580 --> 01:12:59,960
是的
Yes.

915
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:05,040
那你们俩不太合适
Then you two aren't a good match.

916
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:08,630
我们不是在约会
We're not dating.

917
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:14,800
水瓶座很容易在危难时离开别人
Aquarius tend to leave people easily in bad situations.

918
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:25,620
- 啤酒要吗？ - 谢谢
- Beer?  - Thank you.

919
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:30,340
怎么了？
What's wrong?

920
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:37,380
没事，一看到你表哥，我就有这样的感觉
Nothing. I get like this whenever I see your cousin.

921
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:40,370
别说了
Don't get started.

922
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:43,510
为什么他活得那样？
Why does he live like that?

923
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,790
你为什么一个人在这？
Why are you here alone?

924
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:13,950
我不喜欢人多
I don't like a big crowd.

925
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:16,170
我也是
Me, neither.

926
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:23,260
你不想和我聊聊吗？
You don't want to talk to me?

927
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,250
嗯？
Huh?

928
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:29,090
但我可很想和你聊天
But I've been dying to talk to you.

929
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:28,880
请坐
Have a seat.

930
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:03,630
爱喜，抽吗？
Menthols, okay?

931
01:16:37,370 --> 01:16:38,840
表兄弟？
Cousins?

932
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,500
他是你表弟吗？
Is he your younger cousin?

933
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:43,000
不，我们同岁
No, we're the same age.

934
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,420
我的生日还更大点
My birthday's a little faster.

935
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:46,920
那为什么你看起来那么老？
Then why do you look so old?

936
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:49,210
你还说别人
You should talk.

937
01:16:49,330 --> 01:16:51,500
你看起来都50多了
You look way past 50.

938
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,500
那是因为我过过苦日子
It's 'cuz I had a tough life.

939
01:16:56,830 --> 01:16:59,500
但他像个王子一样长大
But he grew up like a prince.

940
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:03,800
- 他不显老是因为他幼稚  - 是的，我是有点不成熟
- He never gets old 'cuz he's childish.  - That's right. I'm a little immature.

941
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:06,590
女人喜欢那样的男人
Women like that in men.

942
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:11,500
我忙的屁股不着地，他继承了家族生意
I'd work my butt off and he'd inherit the family business.

943
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:15,920
然后他把家里所有钱都弄没了
Then he went and lost all the money in the family.

944
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,580
甚至他老婆都抛弃了他
Even his wife ran out on him.

945
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:22,450
真的吗？她跑了？
Really? She ran away?

946
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:27,460
- 闭嘴，那是隐私  - 哥们，真糟糕
- Shut up. That's private.  - Man, that sucks.

947
01:17:27,870 --> 01:17:30,250
我意识到男人需要金钱和权力
I realized a man needs to have money and power.

948
01:17:30,370 --> 01:17:32,540
当然，男人需要
Of course, he does.

949
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:37,250
你真不成熟，你们俩都是
You're so immature. Both of you.

950
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:39,670
我只是说我担心他
Just saying I'm worried about him.

951
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:41,830
我帮过他多少次了？
How many times did I help him out?

952
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,750
那下次就袖手旁观吧
Just watch it next time.

953
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,750
这么说我是坏人了？
So I'm the bad guy, huh?

954
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,040
算了吧
Forget it.

955
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:54,960
没事，大家都知道
It's okay. Everyone knows.

956
01:17:55,410 --> 01:17:57,590
谁还要猪排？
More pork chops anyone?

957
01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:00,580
- 请来块熟的  - 没问题
- A well done one, please.  - Sure thing.

958
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:02,460
- 给我拿个香肠  - 好的
- And get me a sausage.  - Okay.

959
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:08,710
在感恩节上我看见他父亲了，他情况很不好
I saw his dad at Thanksgiving. He was a mess.

960
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:13,130
我希望他不会太担心他父亲
I wish he wouldn't worry his dad so much.

961
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:17,210
但有时候我也嫉妒他
But there are times, when I envy him.

962
01:18:18,370 --> 01:18:22,710
无论事情多糟糕，他好像都不烦心
No matter how hard things get, it doesn't seem to bother him.

963
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:28,130
他有个疯狂的想法，要在西班牙开个俱乐部什么的
He's got a crazy idea of opening up a pub in Spain or something.

964
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:30,920
- 西班牙？ - 对
- Spain?  - Yes.

965
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:33,550
难道他没告诉你吗？
Didn't he tell you about that?

966
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:38,910
饱了
That's enough.

967
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:41,000
- 给你个新烤的  - 咱们走吧
- Here's a fresh round.  - Let's go.

968
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,500
什么？我们还没吃呢
What? We didn't even eat yet.

969
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:45,080
我的香肠在哪？
Where's my sausage?

970
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,170
- 哦，好的  - 咱们走吧！
- Oh, right.  - Let's just go!

971
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:49,080
等等
Wait.

972
01:18:59,830 --> 01:19:01,380
给你香肠
Here's your sausage.

973
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:03,160
- 谢谢  - 马上回来
- Thanks.  - Be right back.

974
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:16,460
你不高兴吗？
Are you upset?

975
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:20,670
我表弟就那样
My cousin's like that.

976
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:22,880
大家开始都误解他
People mistake him at first.

977
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:26,250
但他从内心讲是个好人
But he's a good guy at heart.

978
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:31,120
在他那样对你后，你怎么还能这么说？
How can you say that after what he did to you?

979
01:19:32,290 --> 01:19:34,040
他对我怎么了？
What did he do?

980
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:37,460
难道你听到一点赞扬之词了吗？难道你不生气吗？
Don't you have any pride? Aren't you angry?

981
01:19:39,870 --> 01:19:41,000
你说得对
You're right.

982
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:45,920
现在我想想这事
Now that I think about it.

983
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:48,040
他太让我生气了！
Ooo he makes me mad!

984
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:16,670
跑了的老婆是怎么回事？
What's with the runaway wife?

985
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,670
那个呀，我离婚了
Oh, that. I got divorced.

986
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:24,710
实际上，她踹了我
Actually, she divorced me.

987
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:30,170
你一年内既结婚又离婚？
You got married and divorced all in one year?

988
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:31,710
没啥好说的
What can I say.

989
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:37,290
生意垮了的时候，她把事看的很严重
When the business went down, she took it real hard.

990
01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:38,910
于是我就让她走了
So I let her go.

991
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:47,090
我不想看到她因为我而不幸福
I didn't want to see her unhappy 'cuz of me.

992
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:57,460
我想我可能是个不错的人
I guess I could be a pretty nice guy.

993
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,750
这种事你怎么都能开玩笑呢？
How can you joke about something like that?

994
01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:02,660
过去的就过去了
Well, what's past is past.

995
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:09,540
我永远都搞不清你是不是认真的
I can never tell if you're being sincere or not.

996
01:21:10,290 --> 01:21:12,960
我知道我有点简单
I know I can be a little simple.

997
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,580
但我一直是认真的
But I've always been sincere.

998
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:18,170
好了，算了吧
Okay. Drop it.

999
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:22,210
为什么我认真的时候你总是打断我？
Why do you always cut me off when I'm being serious?

1000
01:21:22,370 --> 01:21:27,050
别认真了，嘻嘻哈哈最适合你
Don't get serious. Joking around suits you best.

1001
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:28,540
明白
Gotcha.

1002
01:21:29,290 --> 01:21:30,830
咱们就去弄钱吧
Let's just go get the money.

1003
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,410
只差九十万了
We have only $900 left to go.

1004
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:41,500
那我现在我可以直接进去了吗？
So I can come right in, now?

1005
01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:46,710
教师办公室吗？谢谢
The teachers' room? Thank you.

1006
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:50,830
是在一楼吗？
Is it on the first floor?

1007
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:54,000
我们能从这过去吗？
Can we go thru here?

1008
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:56,290
谢谢，祝你愉快
Thank you. Have a nice day.

1009
01:21:58,250 --> 01:21:59,500
咱们走，喜秀
Let's go, Hee-su.

1010
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:01,090
我能把车停这吗？
Can I park the car here?

1011
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:04,210
当然可以，那辆车就停在这
Sure. That car's parked here.

1012
01:22:08,620 --> 01:22:10,710
你不把导航藏起来吗？
You're not hiding the navigator?

1013
01:22:10,830 --> 01:22:12,210
算了吧
Forget it.

1014
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:14,660
你确定吗？
You sure?

1015
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,460
怎么了？
What?

1016
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:31,540
好现象
It's a good thing.

1017
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,370
我很高兴你没变
I'm glad you didn't change.

1018
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,040
你在说什么呢？
What are you talking about?

1019
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:41,160
我知道你总是会进步的，或早或晚
I knew you'd always be doing well somewhere.

1020
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:45,250
我喜欢你这点
I liked that about you.

1021
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,170
别装正经了，我告诉过你那不适合你
Don't act serious. I told you, it doesn't suit you.

1022
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:53,380
你总是知道你在干什么
You always knew what you were doing.

1023
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:56,830
很好，除了有点倔强
Perfect. Except for that feisty side.

1024
01:22:59,790 --> 01:23:01,290
我就喜欢你这样
I like you the way you are.

1025
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:04,710
- 永不改变  - 什么？别说了
- Don't ever change.  - What? Stop it.

1026
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:08,710
- 想跑跑暖和一下吗？ - 不
- Wanna run to keep warm?  - No.

1027
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:11,630
我也不想
Me neither.

1028
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:23,830
- 你是找素妍的吧？ - 对
- Are you here for So-yeon?  - Yes.

1029
01:23:23,950 --> 01:23:25,920
- 嗨，我是她老师  - 你好
- Hi, I'm her teacher.  - Hello.

1030
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,250
你是她叔叔吗？
You're her uncle?

1031
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:32,830
准确地说不是，但也差不多
Well not exactly, but sort of.

1032
01:23:33,830 --> 01:23:35,300
你要打电话确认一下吗？
Would you like to call and check?

1033
01:23:35,450 --> 01:23:37,170
不用了，没事
No, it's okay.

1034
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,870
你来早了…
You're early...

1035
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:45,090
那边下去，到隔壁楼
Go down that way to the next building.

1036
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,170
她在一楼，你可以带她回家
She's on the first floor. You can take her home.

1037
01:23:47,330 --> 01:23:48,960
谢谢
Thank you.

1038
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:58,590
她父母很信任你，这种事都让你帮忙吗？
Her parents trust you enough to ask for favors like this?

1039
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:01,380
她从小就很喜欢我
She liked me a lot ever since she was little.

1040
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:04,090
我很受小孩欢迎
I'm pretty popular with the kids.

1041
01:24:04,830 --> 01:24:06,880
我猜你很合适和小孩在一起
Bet you fit right in with them.

1042
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,580
不是，那是因为我理解他们看世界的角度
No, it's 'cuz I can relate to how they look at the world.

1043
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:13,670
是这样吗？
Is that so?

1044
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:17,170
素妍在有些方面很像你
So-yeon's a lot like you in some ways.

1045
01:24:17,950 --> 01:24:21,910
她聪明但很有个性
She's smart but has one heck of a personality.

1046
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,460
但我从未被停学
But I never got suspended from school.

1047
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:27,130
人人都有缺点
Everyone suffers from something.

1048
01:24:27,290 --> 01:24:30,750
素妍、我和你，我们都是
So-yeon, me, you... We all do.

1049
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:32,670
甚至是那边的学校门卫
Even the school guard back there.

1050
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:58,340
回到学校的感觉真奇怪
It feels weird being back at school.

1051
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:01,800
激起了许多感受，你呢？
Brings back a lot of emotions. How about you?

1052
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,210
这些孩子们在哪呢？
Where are all the kids?

1053
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,210
或许老师告诉我们错了地方
Maybe the teacher told us the wrong place.

1054
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:33,090
她在哪呢？
Where is she?

1055
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:45,670
- 我没结婚  - 嗯？
- I didn't get married.  - Huh?

1056
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,250
没什么
Nothing.

1057
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:56,460
喂，等一下！
Hey, wait!

1058
01:25:56,790 --> 01:26:00,750
你认识一个叫严素妍的学生吗？
Do you know a student named EUM So-yeon?

1059
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:03,550
不知道
Sorry.

1060
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:06,250
好的，好好干吧
Okay, keep up the good work.

1061
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:13,380
我要去再问问老师
I'll go ask the teacher again.

1062
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:04,960
你在干什么呢？
What are you doing?

1063
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:09,870
你说什么？
Pardon?

1064
01:27:10,410 --> 01:27:12,090
你在干什么呢？
What are you doing?

1065
01:27:14,410 --> 01:27:15,880
铲口香糖
Scraping off gum.

1066
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:20,080
为什么干这个？
What's this for?

1067
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:27,250
填满那个，我就可以回家了
If I fill that up, I can go home.

1068
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:33,960
那不是我的错
It's not my fault.

1069
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:39,880
我不能整天盯着她
I can't go around keeping an eye on her all day.

1070
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:42,670
学生也有他们的权利
Students have their rights.

1071
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:45,170
她的手机关机了
Her cell phone's off.

1072
01:27:45,330 --> 01:27:46,920
我们难道不应该报她失踪吗？
Shouldn't we report her missing?

1073
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:49,840
她只不见了一个小时
She's only been gone for an hour.

1074
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:52,260
严女士吗？
Mrs. EUM?

1075
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:58,470
你最后和素妍通话是在什么时候？
When did you last speak with So-yeon?

1076
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:46,080
见到你最喜欢的秉云叔叔，难道你不高兴吗？
Aren't you glad to see your favorite Uncle B?

1077
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:51,290
我很想念你，伙计
I missed you big time, kiddo.

1078
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:54,370
我们有一年没见了吧？
Has it been a year, since we met?

1079
01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:55,500
别激动
Relax.

1080
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:57,210
有两年了
It's been two years.

1081
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:59,210
没错
Oh, that's right.

1082
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:04,790
我可以自己回家，秉云叔叔，放心吧
I can go home by myself, Uncle B. Just go.

1083
01:29:04,950 --> 01:29:06,210
你难道不是在约会吗？
Aren't you on a date?

1084
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:09,540
那是我们三个人的约会！
A date for all three of us, then!

1085
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:15,460
你担心我会再跑掉吗？
You're worried that I'll run off again?

1086
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:19,540
得了，我们是朋友，我从不那么想
Come on, we're pals. I'd never think that.

1087
01:29:20,660 --> 01:29:22,960
你不必这么说
You don't have to say that.

1088
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:32,460
你喜欢什么样的音乐？你在听什么？
What kind of music do you like? What were you listening to?

1089
01:29:33,580 --> 01:29:35,170
好像我告诉你，你就知道似的
Like you'd know if I told you.

1090
01:29:35,290 --> 01:29:40,840
我当然知道，你知道阿瑟…金…金布瑞克吗？
Of course I would. Do you know Astru... Gil... Gilbrake?

1091
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:42,330
怎么了？
What?

1092
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:54,800
车被拖走了
It got towed.

1093
01:29:55,830 --> 01:29:58,130
你说我可以把车停这！
You said I could park here!

1094
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:00,920
他们周六也拖车吗？
They have towing on Saturdays?

1095
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:05,000
真是工作努力呀！
Some diligent workers...

1096
01:30:05,660 --> 01:30:08,420
我的包…包在车上
My bag... it's in the car.

1097
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:10,630
哦，不
Oh, no.

1098
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:16,870
我们去把车取回来，离这不远
We'll go get the car back. It's not far from here.

1099
01:30:17,410 --> 01:30:18,500
来吧
Come on.

1100
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:20,590
放开！
Let go!

1101
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:18,340
要手帕吗？
Want a handkerchief?

1102
01:31:19,450 --> 01:31:21,710
素妍呢？好的
So-yeon? Good.

1103
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:34,210
嗨，这是残疾人专座
Hey, this is the handicapped seat.

1104
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:36,920
坐这或许也成
It's probably okay to sit there.

1105
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:46,840
你不想见到我，对吗？
You don't wanna see me, right?

1106
01:31:46,950 --> 01:31:48,630
想要我做到别的地方吗？
Want me to sit somewhere else?

1107
01:31:50,290 --> 01:31:52,420
好吧，我去别的地方
Fine. I'll go somewhere else.

1108
01:31:52,870 --> 01:31:54,790
我走
I'm going.

1109
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:44,340
对不起，我觉着好像都是我的错
I'm sorry. I feel like it's my fault.

1110
01:32:46,290 --> 01:32:48,130
不是，当然不是
No, of course it's not.

1111
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:51,840
都是我的错
It's all my fault.

1112
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:57,330
那是为什么？
Why's that?

1113
01:33:00,370 --> 01:33:02,620
遇人不淑
For meeting the wrong person.

1114
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:13,420
我猜他可能很孩子气
I guess he can be pretty childish.

1115
01:33:14,660 --> 01:33:19,790
但我仍旧觉着秉云叔叔不错，他不那么坏
But I still think Uncle B is okay. He's not that bad.

1116
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:28,500
你为什么逃学？
Why did you skip school?

1117
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:34,290
对不起，我不应该问的
Sorry. I shouldn't have asked.

1118
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:42,880
就是喜欢逃学
Just felt like it.

1119
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,840
为什么我们不打个车呢？
Why don't we catch a cab?

1120
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:42,500
地铁更快
The subway's faster.

1121
01:34:43,330 --> 01:34:46,000
- 靠近点，你会淋湿的  - 不用，谢了
- Get closer. You're getting wet.  - No, Thank you.

1122
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:49,920
- 看到没？都湿了  - 我没事
- See? It's all wet.  - I'm fine.

1123
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:07,840
咱们坐下一趟吧，喜秀
Let's take the next one, Hee-su.

1124
01:35:08,370 --> 01:35:11,830
等等！
Wait up!

1125
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:44,500
屏蔽门即将关闭
The screen doors are closing.

1126
01:35:45,410 --> 01:35:47,960
我告诉过你我们应该坐下一趟
I told you we should catch the next one.

1127
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:50,580
怎么了？你受伤了吗？
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

1128
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:52,580
我想我扭脚脖子了
I think I sprained my ankle.

1129
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:55,250
但会没事的
But it'll be okay.

1130
01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:04,460
我只是想…
I just wanted to...

1131
01:36:05,790 --> 01:36:08,260
快点去取车
go get the car faster.

1132
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:12,760
哥们，你真是很快呀
Man, you're pretty fast.

1133
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:52,210
坐下吧
Sit down.

1134
01:36:52,330 --> 01:36:54,460
不用，我没事
No, I'm okay.

1135
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:13,380
艾米连科·菲多综合格斗大赛
M-1 Festival with Emelianenko Fedor

1136
01:37:27,290 --> 01:37:32,540
六十亿分之一世界最强男即将到来
One in 6 billion, the strongest man in the world coming your way.

1137
01:37:33,790 --> 01:37:35,040
菲多
Fedor.

1138
01:37:39,790 --> 01:37:42,540
我过去从不喜欢格斗运动
I never used to like combat sports.

1139
01:37:42,660 --> 01:37:46,540
但有一天我在电视上偶然看到他
But I saw him by chance on TV one day.

1140
01:37:47,370 --> 01:37:51,330
他看起来就像邻居家普通友好的哥们
He looked like the average, nice guy next door.

1141
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:55,050
在台上等待时他很腼腆
He looked so shy waiting up on the ring.

1142
01:37:55,200 --> 01:38:00,630
但当比赛开始时，这家伙就完全变了
But when the game started, the guy completely changed.

1143
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:03,540
他就开始猛击对手
He started pounding away at his opponent.

1144
01:38:03,660 --> 01:38:06,130
我从未见过像他这样的人
I've never seen anything like him.

1145
01:38:06,290 --> 01:38:10,790
他和我见过的选手都不一样
He's nothing like any fighter I've ever seen.

1146
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:18,790
场内不可战胜，场外乐意助人，就像超人一样
Invincible on the ring, but a kind helper outside like a superhero.

1147
01:38:20,540 --> 01:38:25,120
有一次我躺下
Once when I was down.

1148
01:38:25,450 --> 01:38:32,120
我在梦里看到了他，他甚至说韩语
I saw him in my dream. He even spoke Korean.

1149
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:39,000
他说“你还好吗？感觉怎么样？”
He said, 'Are you okay? How are you feeling? '

1150
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:47,290
我感到非常快乐，说“我现在好了，谢谢你”
I felt overcome with joy and said, 'I'm okay now, thanks to you.'

1151
01:38:47,450 --> 01:38:51,660
很神奇，但有一段时间我的确感到好多了…
It's amazing, but for a while I actually felt better and...

1152
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:58,250
怎么了？
What's wrong?

1153
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:09,260
该死…
Oh, darn...

1154
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:07,010
这有很多人和我们一样
There's a lot of people here like us.

1155
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:21,750
至少我们不孤单，高兴点，喜秀
At least we're not alone. Cheer up, Hee-su.

1156
01:42:23,910 --> 01:42:25,290
真是糟糕！
What the!

1157
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:42,050
这是怎么了？
What's wrong with this?

1158
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:52,170
- 让我来试试  - 别碰它
- Let me try.  - Don't touch it.

1159
01:42:52,290 --> 01:42:55,460
- 你会弄断的  - 不会，别担心
- You'll just break it.  - No, don't worry.

1160
01:42:57,700 --> 01:42:58,960
这可能有用
This might help.

1161
01:43:08,120 --> 01:43:14,410
你为什么没结婚？
Why didn't you get married?

1162
01:43:20,540 --> 01:43:22,710
我做不到
I couldn't do it.

1163
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:26,920
基本上是我离开了他
Basically, I left him.

1164
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:32,710
他的一个员工盗用了一些钱
One of his workers embezzled some cash

1165
01:43:32,830 --> 01:43:35,080
他也失业了
and he lost his job, too.

1166
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:41,200
就在婚礼前突然没了工作…
Suddenly out-of-work right before the wedding...

1167
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:48,080
他建议我们分手
He suggested we break up.

1168
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:52,790
所以我就分了，正如我期待的那样
So I did. Like I've been waiting for it.

1169
01:43:55,330 --> 01:43:56,960
我很坏，是不是？
Bad, aren't I?

1170
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:04,880
更糟糕的是再找个工作不是很容易
To make matters worse, it wasn't easy to find another job.

1171
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:10,750
我不能再从基层干起了
I couldn't start at the bottom, again.

1172
01:44:11,580 --> 01:44:15,380
这东西怎么会变成这样呢？
How in the world did this get like this?

1173
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:21,960
你难道就不能认真一次吗？
Can't you be serious for once!

1174
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:24,090
我听着呢
I was listening.

1175
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:27,760
算了，上车吧
Forget it. Get in.

1176
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,630
你有胶带吗？
Do you have any duct tape?

1177
01:44:29,790 --> 01:44:31,330
赶快上车！
Just get in!

1178
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:49,340
听起来有点像我的故事
Sounds kinda like my story.

1179
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:50,710
什么？
What?

1180
01:44:50,870 --> 01:44:53,920
你知道的，他和我
You know. Him and me.

1181
01:44:54,250 --> 01:44:57,250
当情况不好时，让他的女人离开
Sending his woman away when things turned bad.

1182
01:44:58,250 --> 01:45:01,420
使我想起了某个电影明星，他曾说过…
Reminds me of some movie star who once said...

1183
01:45:02,290 --> 01:45:05,620
“我们分手因为我们真心相爱”
'We're breaking up because we truly love each other.'

1184
01:45:43,620 --> 01:45:47,380
那在西班牙开俱乐部的主意怎么样呢？
So how about the pub in Spain idea?

1185
01:45:48,370 --> 01:45:49,840
我说过不咋样
I said, no.

1186
01:46:28,660 --> 01:46:30,010
来点吗？
Want some?

1187
01:46:40,330 --> 01:46:41,920
味道不错，甜甜的吧？
Nice and sweet, huh?

1188
01:46:56,620 --> 01:46:58,370
别这样
Stop it.

1189
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:01,210
你说过你喜欢我的这边脸
You said you liked this side of my face.

1190
01:47:01,330 --> 01:47:05,500
所以我总习惯站在你左边
So I always used to stand on your left.

1191
01:47:09,620 --> 01:47:12,590
- 我想告诉你  - 什么？
- I wanted to yell at you.  - What?

1192
01:47:14,290 --> 01:47:15,960
如果你那时说你没钱
If you said you didn't have the money,

1193
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:18,670
我本打算嚷嚷一下就走的
I was just going to yell and go.

1194
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:23,080
我听够了嚷嚷了，也不都是你
I've had enough yelling. Not you, too.

1195
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:27,450
- 但是那很好  - 什么很好？
- Still, it was nice.  - What was?

1196
01:47:28,290 --> 01:47:30,460
因为你来找我了
'Cuz you came looking for me.

1197
01:47:31,580 --> 01:47:33,330
随你怎么说吧
Yeah, whatever.

1198
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:39,470
看到没？我们今天做的很好
See? We did good, today.

1199
01:47:39,910 --> 01:47:42,760
离三百五十万非常近了
We're pretty close to $3500.

1200
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:47,460
一整天都借钱还我很好吗？
Borrowing money all day to pay me was good?

1201
01:47:47,620 --> 01:47:50,590
但因为我们一起做，所以我们能做到
But we could do it 'cuz we're together.

1202
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,090
要是一个人干就很辛苦了
It would've been hard doing it alone.

1203
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:05,210
再打一下电话，要是还得晚点，我就走了
Call again. I'll just go, if it's any later.

1204
01:48:06,330 --> 01:48:08,830
给我钥匙，我把手机落里边了
Give me the keys. I left the phone inside.

1205
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:12,510
你拿着这个
You can have this.

1206
01:48:45,830 --> 01:48:50,000
你和秉云一起来的，对吗？
You came with Byung-woon, right?

1207
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:52,500
是的
Yes.

1208
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:55,580
你怎么…
How did you...

1209
01:48:55,700 --> 01:48:59,500
早些时候我在商店前见过你
I saw you in front of the store, earlier.

1210
01:48:59,620 --> 01:49:00,870
我记得你
I remember you.

1211
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:03,420
哦，是了
Oh, right.

1212
01:49:04,330 --> 01:49:07,880
让你来两次很抱歉
Sorry to make you come twice.

1213
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:14,960
- 秉云去哪了？ - 就是去车里取点东西了
- Where's Byung-woon?  - Just getting something from the car.

1214
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:18,550
- 妈妈，美少女战士  - 等一下，宝贝
- Mommy, 'Sailor Moon'.  - Hold on, sweetie.

1215
01:49:19,950 --> 01:49:24,630
我给你钥匙，和她说再见，自己回家去
I'll give you the keys. Say goodnight to her and go on in.

1216
01:49:24,790 --> 01:49:26,960
晚安
Goodnight.

1217
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:34,960
哦！
Oh!

1218
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:44,130
这是四十万
Here's $400.

1219
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:47,420
我没有信封装
I didn't have an envelope.

1220
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:53,250
让你等了一整天很不好意思
Sorry to keep you waiting all day.

1221
01:49:57,830 --> 01:50:00,800
我听说他欠了你一年了
I heard he didn't pay you back for a year.

1222
01:50:01,540 --> 01:50:05,290
你也知道他对钱比较不在意
You know he's loose with money.

1223
01:50:07,450 --> 01:50:09,130
但是…
But...

1224
01:50:12,830 --> 01:50:14,380
我…
I...

1225
01:50:18,620 --> 01:50:20,370
我不能收这钱
I can't take this.

1226
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:25,080
你来难道不是为了这个吗？
Didn't you come for this?

1227
01:50:25,250 --> 01:50:28,880
是，但是…
Yes, but...

1228
01:50:32,620 --> 01:50:34,710
他告诉过你了，是不是？
He told you, didn't he?

1229
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:39,170
我离婚了，是个单亲母亲
That I'm divorced and a single mother.

1230
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:43,160
他真是个大嘴巴…
That big mouth of his...

1231
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:45,460
就请拿着吧
Please. Just take it.

1232
01:50:47,450 --> 01:50:50,750
我可能没有很多钱
I may not have a lot,

1233
01:50:50,870 --> 01:50:53,950
但足以帮帮朋友忙了
but it's enough to help out a friend.

1234
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:58,330
当秉云需要帮忙时，我必须帮他
When Byung-woon needs help, I have to help him.

1235
01:50:58,870 --> 01:51:01,870
他帮我度过了很多艰难时光
He helped me through many rough times.

1236
01:51:02,290 --> 01:51:03,960
所以就拿着吧
So just take it.

1237
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,670
他真的了不起
He's really something.

1238
01:51:14,790 --> 01:51:20,040
即使在他情况很差的时候，他还坚持帮助我
He insisted on helping me even when things were worse for him.

1239
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:21,510
你们俩都已经很熟吗？
You two got close, already?

1240
01:51:21,620 --> 01:51:23,620
嗨，我很抱歉
Hey, I'm so sorry.

1241
01:51:23,750 --> 01:51:26,420
- 刚才我很忙  - 没事
- I was busy before.  - It's okay.

1242
01:51:26,540 --> 01:51:28,590
- 我给了她四十万  - 谢谢
- I gave her $400.  - Thanks.

1243
01:51:28,750 --> 01:51:31,290
我最好走了
I'd better go.

1244

等一下！
Excuse me!

1249
01:51:55,620 --> 01:51:57,710
就说已经付钱给我了
Let's say I've already been paid.

1250
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:01,910
请别这样
Don't do this, please.

1251
01:52:03,790 --> 01:52:06,290
要是这是因为你考虑到我的情况
If it's 'cuz you're thinking of my state,

1252
01:52:06,410 --> 01:52:08,090
那会伤我自尊的
it hurts my pride.

1253
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:11,960
不是，不是那样的
No, please. It's not like that.

1254
01:52:13,910 --> 01:52:19,090
我也不能收，我答应过秉云
I can't take it either. I promised Byung-woon.

1255
01:52:23,120 --> 01:52:24,670
那…
Then...

1256
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:34,460
咱们这么做，更公平点
Let's do this, to be fair.

1257
01:52:42,290 --> 01:52:46,540
- 你不会让步的，是吧？ - 不会
- You won't budge, will you?  - No.

1258
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:54,540
好吧，我输了
Fine. I lose.

1259
01:52:54,660 --> 01:52:56,460
秉云？看到了吗？
Byung-woon? See that?

1260
01:52:56,580 --> 01:52:58,330
- 我仍旧没食言  - 好的
- I Still kept My promise.  - Okay.

1261
01:52:58,500 --> 01:53:01,620
- 好吧，保重  - 再见
- Well, take care.  - Bye.

1262
01:53:08,540 --> 01:53:12,500
你为什么那么做？现在我们还差二十万
Why'd you do that? Now we're $200 short.

1263
01:53:12,660 --> 01:53:13,830
没事
It's okay.

1264
01:53:23,370 --> 01:53:24,540
那很酷，喜秀
That's cool, Hee-su.

1265
01:53:25,370 --> 01:53:27,210
- 给我写个欠条  - 什么？
- Write me an IOU.  - What?

1266
01:53:27,750 --> 01:53:30,720
- 日后再还我那二十万  - 早就该知道
- Pay me the $200, later.  - Should've known.

1267
01:53:31,120 --> 01:53:34,170
- 写呀  - 好的，二十万
- Write it.  - Okay. $200.

1268
01:53:34,620 --> 01:53:37,590
加上拖车的八万二
Plus the $82 for towing.

1269
01:53:37,700 --> 01:53:38,670
好的
Okay.

1270
01:53:38,830 --> 01:53:42,000
鲜花和加油各三万
And $30 each for the flowers and gas.

1271
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:44,000
别这样
Aw, come on.

1272
01:53:44,330 --> 01:53:46,380
至少我没算巧克力的钱
At least I'm not charging the chocolates.

1273
01:53:46,540 --> 01:53:48,290
但我付大巴和地铁钱了
But I paid for the bus and subway.

1274
01:53:48,410 --> 01:53:50,010
那就把它扣掉
Then take that out.

1275
01:53:50,330 --> 01:53:56,380
二十万加八万二，加六万…然后…
$200 plus, $82, plus $60... then...

1276
01:53:57,830 --> 01:54:04,000
是三十四万二，减去大巴和地铁钱
That's $342 minus the bus and subway fares...

1277
01:54:14,660 --> 01:54:17,040
- 我应该把你放哪？ - 嗯？
- Where should I drop you off?  - Huh?

1278
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:21,460
哦，随便哪个地铁站
Oh, any subway station.

1279

你要蒜精吗？我有很多

1280

蒜精有什么用？
What's with garlic extracts?

1281
01:54:34,290 --> 01:54:39,040
对女人很好，我给你点
It's really good for women. I'll give you some.

1282
01:54:46,790 --> 01:54:48,540
我把你放那行吗？
Should I let you off up there?

1283
01:54:48,660 --> 01:54:51,290
可以，好的
That's fine. Okay.

1284
01:55:19,540 --> 01:55:21,790
晚饭怎么样？我们还有些时间
