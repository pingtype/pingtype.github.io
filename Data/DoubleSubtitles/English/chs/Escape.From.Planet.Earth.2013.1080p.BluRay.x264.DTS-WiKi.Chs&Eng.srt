斯考奇 斯考奇 你在吗
Scorch, Scorch, are you there?

8
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,520
快点 斯考奇 快回答
Come on, Scorch, get back to me.

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,160
你不会又做了什么不经大脑的事吧
You haven't run off and done something reckless, have you?

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,400
盖瑞 我们有麻烦了
Gary, we've got a problem!

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,520
这是我弟弟斯考奇
That's my brother, Scorch.

12
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,250
和往常一样 他又闯祸了
As usual, he's in trouble.

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,920
他是如何陷入这种境地的
How did he get into this mess?

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,880
那可是很久很久之前的事了
For that, I have to go back a long, long time.

15

四十七分钟前 拯救婴儿行动 纳兰克星球
Forty-seven minutes ago. Baby rescue mission. Planet Gnarlach.

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,880
轻点 斯考奇
Quiet, Scorch.

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,440
无论如何 不要惊醒纳兰克人
Whatever you do, don't wake the Gnarlachs.

18
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,760
这就是我 盖瑞・超新星
That's me, Gary Supernova.

19
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,320
我在指挥中心工作 就是说我掌控全局
I work in Mission Control, which means I control the mission.

20
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,120
可斯考奇却不这么认为
Scorch doesn't see it that way.

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,920
放松 盖瑞 他们睡得很死
Relax, Gary, they're fast asleep.

22
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,920
这就是纳兰克人
And that is a Gnarlach.

23
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,050
模样可怕 黏糊糊的
Scary, slimy,

24
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,320
而且 臭得惊天动地

Uploading that to Blue Tube.

26
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,620
盖瑞 这地方闻着
Gary, this place smells

27
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,880
比航天局的茅坑还臭
worse than the latrines at the BASA Academy.

28
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,360
[杯上文字：我爱和平]
多谢你[在我喝水的时候]告诉我
Thank you for that.

29
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,720
[仪表文字：詹姆斯・必应先生]
航天局是我诞生的地方
I was programmed at the BASA Academy.

30
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,330
那里只有进步的味道
The only thing I smelled there was progress.

31
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
闭嘴 詹姆斯
Zip it, James.

32
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,800
[模仿007系列 詹姆斯・邦德]
我叫必应 詹姆斯・必应
The name's Bing, by the way. James Bing.

33
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,730
好了 斯考奇 找到婴儿然后撤离
All right, Scorch, let's find those babies and get you out of there.

34
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,530
找到了 锁定目标飞船
Bingo. Spacecraft identified.

35
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,480
很好 现在谨慎地前行
Good. Now proceed with extreme caution.

36
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,680
拒绝 我要有范儿地前行
Negative. Proceeding with style.

37
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,080
别耍范儿了 斯考奇
Not style again! Scorch!

38
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,810
三星系统进入反转星系
Triple Star System into a Reverse Galaxy,

39
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,920
紧跟双重黑洞翻转
followed by a Double Black Hole with a twist!

40
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,480
平稳着陆
And he sticks the landing!

41
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,360
现在该谨慎前行了
Now proceed with caution.

42
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,200
斯考奇 婴儿应该就在前方
OK, Scorch, the babies should be straight ahead.

43
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,600
收到
Copy that.

44
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,760
不
No!

45
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,480
坏消息 老弟 晚了一步
Bad news, little brother. We're too late.

46
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,520
他们吃掉了婴儿
They've eaten the babies!

47
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,530
这太不公平了
It's so unfair!

48
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,640
斯考奇 婴儿就在你身后
Scorch, they're right behind you.

49
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,680
什么
What?

50
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,200
小家伙们
Hi, little guys.

51
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,680
斯考奇叔叔来救你们了
Uncle Scorch is here to rescue you.

52
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,550
盖瑞 要不要告诉斯考奇
Yeah, Gary, maybe tell Scorch

53
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,080
在这种情况下不要大声喧哗？
to keep his voice down in this situation?

54
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,520
- 仅供参考  - 斯考奇 安静点
- Just a thought.  - Scorch, quiet!

55
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,540
盖瑞 你真该来看看
Gary, you should see them.

56
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,400
他们太可爱了 真神奇
They're so cute. It's magical.

57
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,760
你会把周围这一群都吵醒的
You're gonna wake up the whole neighborhood.

58
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,040
这一群可不是什么好鸟
And this is not a good neighborhood.

59
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,360
- 躲猫猫  - 斯考奇
- Peekaboo!  - Scorch?

60
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,320
哎呦喂
Excuse me.

61
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,760
- 这下可好 又来了  - 斯考奇
- Good, here we go again.  - Scorch!

62
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,120
盖瑞 我们有麻烦了
Gary, we've got a problem!

63
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,160
麻烦还不小 你从来不听我指挥
Of course we have a problem. You never listen to me.

64
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,720
你说只有十二个纳兰克人 盖瑞
You said there were 12 Gnarlachs, Gary.

65
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,680
不 我说有一千两百个
No, I said 1200.

66
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,840
不 你没说过
Nope, I don't think you did.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,280
- 有一千两百个纳兰克人  - 了解
- There are 1200 Gnarlachs down there.  - Got it.

68
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,520
- 一千两百个会吃婴儿的纳兰克人  - 了解
- Twelve-hundred baby-eating Gnarlachs.  - Got it.

69
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,920
一千两百个死敌 纳兰克人
Twelve-hundred of our archenemies, the Gnarlachs.

70
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,280
- 一千两百个  - 了解
- Twelve-hundred of 'em.  - Got it.

71
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,360
如果你说是一千两百个 我肯定会记得
Nope. I think I'd remember if you said 1200.

72
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,170
- 来真格的吧  - 好
- Now do your thing.  - OK.

73
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,890
前方二十码处是死亡山谷

76
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,040
一
one.

77
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,530
看到没
You see that?

78
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,000
这就是哥的能耐
That's what I'm talking about!

79
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,400
放马过来吧 丑八怪
Scorch me, baby!

80
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,370
小宝贝们 你们的座驾在此
Helpless babies, your chariot awaits.

81
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,600
就在你们眼皮底下呢
In your face, Gnarlachs!

82
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,480
婴儿我带走了
I got the babies!

83
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,560
不 不
No, no.

84
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,280
别哭 别哭 不怕 不怕 没事
Guys, no, no. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

85
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,400
别哭 别哭 不怕
No, no, no, don't cry. Don't cry.

86
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,250
- 盖瑞  - 正在处理
- Gary?  - I'm on it.

87
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,680

先生 这里是禁飞区
This is a no-fly zone, mister.

91
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,440
真有意思 老爸
Very funny, Dad.

92

I'm serious. This console's expensive, Kipper.

93
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,800
控制台？我就在这里 难以置信
Console? I mean... I mean, I'm right here. Unbelievable

94
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,920
能把飞船还给我吗
Can I have my spaceship back?

95
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,320
- 不行  - 爸爸 你什么都不让我做

Yeah, yeah, I know.

98
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,560
烫死了 烫死了
It burns! It burns!

99
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,530
抱歉 爸爸
Sorry,Dad.

100
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,880
好了 我们来玩乖乖坐的游戏吧
OK, let's play the game where you sit on your hands.

101
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,450
- 那游戏烂死了  - 盖瑞
- That game stinks.  - Gary!

102
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,200
做件好事 把这家伙停好
Be a pal, park this puppy, will ya?

103
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,280
启动远程协助
Activating remote assistance.

104
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,550
看老爸给你露一手
Time to watch your old man

105
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,760
让超新星九号完美着陆
bring in the Supernova-9 for a landing.

106
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,440
斯考奇回来了
Scorch is back!

107
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,880
我爱你 巴卜星球
I love you, planet Baab!

00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,440
好棒
Cool!

109
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,440
老爸厉害吧
And that is how you do that.

110
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,600
- 盖瑞  - 什么 这也太吓人了
- Gary!  - What? OK, that's terrifying.

111
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,570
为什么你每次都要开启大头模式
Why do you always call me in jumbo-head mode?

112
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,800
我们收到星系中未知区域的求救信号
We've received an SOS from an uncharted sector of the galaxy.

113
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,760
准备让斯考奇执行下一个任务
Prepare for Scorch's next mission.

Copy that, boss. Where are we headed?

115

去黑暗星球
He's going to the Dark Planet.

116
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,480
莉娜 你疯了吗
Lena, are you crazy?

117
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,690
我…重新措辞一下
Let me... rephrase that.

118
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,840
黑暗星球得名的原因是去的人无一生还
They call it the Dark Planet because nobody ever comes back.

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,840
这无异于去黑洞送死
It's like going into a black hole.

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,600
他一小时后出发
He leaves in an hour.

121
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,330
他要去黑暗星球？酷毙了
He's going to the Dark Planet? Wicked!

122
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,050
呆在这里 不许乱碰
Stay here. Don't touch anything.

123
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,720
没人会去黑暗星球
And nobody's going to the Dark Planet.

124
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,640
我们要去黑暗星球了
We are going to the Dark Planet!

125
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,640
- 斯考奇  - 斯考奇 我有个问题
- Scorch!  - Scorch, one question!

126
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,040
别提问 只拍照
No questions, just pictures.

127
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,320
好极了
Yeah, baby!

128
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,560
抱歉 斯考奇 斯考奇・超新星
Excuse me, Scorch! Scorch Supernova!

129
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,330
前排这位美丽的女士请提问
Yes, the beautiful young lady in the front row.

130

甜心 欢迎回家
Sweetie. Welcome home.

131
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,240
- 嘉比 这是现场直播  - 对了
- Gabby, we're live.  - Right.

132
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,440
跟我们说说行动的事吧
Tell us about the mission.

133
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,800
黑暗星球
The Dark Planet.

134
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,720
即便对我来说 也是凶险异常
It's heroic, even for me.

135
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,520
从没有人活着回来
No one has ever come back alive.

136
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,400
抱歉 不好意思 借过
Pardon me. Excuse me. Coming through.

137
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,560
- 你有时间准备吗  - 不 不用准备
- Have you had time to prepare?  - No, no, we haven't.

138
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,790
这是盖瑞・超新星 我的老弟
Gary Supernova, my baby brother.

139
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,120
事实上 我比他大
Fact check. I'm older than him.

140
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,480
盖瑞在书呆子工厂鼓捣出许多小破发明
Gary works all the gizmos and bleep-bloops here in the nerd factory.

141
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,600
我在指挥中心工作
I work in Mission Control.

142
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,920
我们用交互动力场矩阵来实现…
We use a trans-inducified field matrix to...

143
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,560
今天的《无聊报道》到此结束
And that's today's edition of The Boring Report.

144
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,170
请继续 嘉比
Back to you, Gabby.

145
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,540
我是巴卜星电视台的嘉比・泡泡娃
For BNN, this is Gabby Babblebrock,

146
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,960
在航天局总部为您现场播报
reporting live from BASA headquarters.

147
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,690
- 我要娶她  - 我为她感到遗憾
- I'm gonna marry that girl.  - And I feel sorry for her.

148
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,080
听着 我们对黑暗星球几乎一无所知
Now, listen, we know almost nothing about the Dark Planet.

149
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,680
没人知道 我们得推迟行动
No one does. We need to postpone the mission.

150
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,360
我也想 但我已经跟赞助商说好了
I would, but I've already contacted all my sponsors.

151
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,720
黑暗星球可乐 颠覆味觉体验
Dark Planet Cola! Destroy your taste buds!

152
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,720
含糖量百分之八百
This is 800 percent sugar.

153
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,450
所以对孩子更有益
That's what makes it good for kids.

154
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,840
而且 我已经拍了麦片包装的新形象
Plus, I've already taken the photos for the new cereal box.

155
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,000
什么时候
When?

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
尽享斯考奇麦片
J' Scorchios J'

157
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,120
- 刚刚  - “斯考奇麦片”？
- Just now.  - Scorchios?

158
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,440
每盒都有惊喜
There's a surprise in every box.

159
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,640
- 我玩得还不错  - 好了
- I'm pretty good at this.  - OK.

160
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,280
- 停下 停下  - 我能玩一整天
- Come... Come on!  - I could do this all day.

161
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,440
给我住手
Knock it off!

162
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,290
- 我们得认真考虑  - 考虑好了
- We need to think this through.  - I have.

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,120
有人向我求救 我得去帮助他们
Someone out there needs my help, and I am going to help them.

164
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,560
好 如果你现在去 我可帮不了你
OK, but if you go now, I can't help you help them.

165
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,440
盖瑞 你说得太对了
You know, Gary, you're absolutely right.

166
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,960
没必要急在一时
There's no sense in rushing things.

167
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,560
不然你去指挥室研究一下星系图
Why don't you pull up the star charts in the briefing room,

168
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,640
然后我们再和整个团队讨论
and we'll talk about this with the whole team.

169
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,640
没问题 伙计
You got it, partner.

170
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,120
这就够他忙的了 准备启动飞船
That should keep him busy. Let's fire up the ship!

171
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,600
电脑 载入黑暗星球的所有信息
Computer, load all information on the Dark Planet.

172
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,330
好的 稍等 文件扫描中 找到了
All right, just a sec. Scanning files, scanning files...Here we are.

173
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:01,560
黑暗星球 遥远的M级行星
The Dark planet. A remote M-class planet located 400 light-years

174
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,400
距金牛座分子云四百光年
past the Taurus Molecular Cloud.

175
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,800
光怪陆离 令人生畏
A strange and terrifying environment,

176
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,970
唯一已知的逆向进化发生地
the only known world in which evolution is taking place in reverse.

177
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,850
起初曾有过美丽智慧的生灵
It began with intelligent, attractive beings,

178
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,200
但很快被一群丑陋野蛮
but was soon overrun by ugly, aggressive

179
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,440
且傻的可怕的生物所取代
and quite terrifying dim-witted creatures.

180
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,280
好恶心
Yuck. Gross.

181
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,720
如你所见
As you can see,

182
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,720
从温文尔雅进化到野蛮呆傻
from gentle intelligence to savage stupidity.

183
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,960
他们有个奇怪的习俗
They have a strange custom of dividing themselves

184
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,540
即将领土划分为所谓的国家
into what they call countries,

185
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,200
一直就边境线问题争论不休
whose boundaries they often dispute

186
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,120
时常引发战争
which causes them to go to war.

187
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,540
基本模式似乎是
The pattern seems to be that

188
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,520
战胜国战后开始衰落
the winner of the war then goes into decline

189
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,360
而战败国富强
while the loser prospers.

190
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,140
我们还推断出 此星球的人们
We have also deduced that the people of this planet

191
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,390
依据面部毛发的丰密及诡异程度
choose leaders according to the oddity and profusion

192
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,160
来选择他们的领导人
of their facial hair.

193
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,780
他们崇尚金钱 汤羹
They worship money, soup,

194
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,240
马克笔 还有一种叫做牙线的东西
marker pens, something called dental floss

195
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,050
- 这个人叫科威尔  - 好可怕
- and this man, whose name is Cowell.  - Terrifying!

196
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,280
他因奇怪的口音出名 超级有钱
He's known for his strange accent, being very, very rich,

197
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,280
喜欢卖弄 在室内戴眼镜 我喜欢他
showing off, wearing glasses indoors. I like him.

198
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,480
一百零六名高级生物体
One hundred and six advanced life-forms

199
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,400
曾登陆黑暗星球
have landed on the Dark Planet

200
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,960
- 什么  - 试图建立友好的第一次接触
- What?  - to attempt friendly first contact.

201
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,770
结果全部下落不明
Not a single one has returned.

202
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,570
斯考奇叔叔
Uncle Scorch!

203
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,680
基普
Kipper!

204
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,800
你刚才帅呆了
You were awesome out there.

205
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,690
谢谢 伙计 你爸知道你在这里吗
Thanks, pal. Does your dad know you're here?

206
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,070
我应该在办公室等他的
I'm supposed to be waiting in his office,

207
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,440
但指挥中心太无聊了
but Mission Control is boring.

208
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,000
我能理解 是吧 全都是…
I know. Isn't it? It's all...

209
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,960
我更愿意当宇航员 像你一样
I'm more of an astronaut, like you.

210
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,200
这次也带我去吧
Take me with you this time.

211
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,010
你老爸会气死的
That sure would upset your dad,

212
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,480
虽然我挺想气气他的
which is something I love to do.

213
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,560
但听我说 基普
But I'll tell you what, Kipper...

214
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,530
如果我有麻烦 你要来救我
If I get into trouble, you come rescue me.

215
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,400
遵命 基普中尉 小小探险者 听凭差遣
Yes, sir! Lieutenant Kip, Junior Adventurer, at your service!

216
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,960
小小探险者 是吗
Junior Adventurer, are you?

217
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,280
- 这是什么  - 爆炸胶带
- What have we here?  - Blast tape!

218
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,480
准备好实战演习了吗
Ready for a training mission?

219
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,680
好 我们紧急迫降了
OK, we've crash-landed.

220
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,810
被一群黏糊糊绿油油的外星人包围
We're surrounded by a tribe of slimy, green aliens,

221
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,610
他们在不断缩小包围圈
and they are closing in on us.

222
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,520
你该怎么做 要这样 看好
What do you do? You do this! Watch!

223
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,520
- 吃我一炮  - 帅气
- Take that!  - Cool!

224
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,680
- 是时候收拾垃圾了  - 好棒
- Time to take out the trash!  - Awesome!

225
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,600
放马过来吧
Scorch me, baby!

226
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,080
我被击中了
They got me!

227
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,760
- 基普 全靠你了  - 棒极了
- Kipper, it's up to you.  - Wicked!

228
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,160
你们在干什么
What are you doing?

229
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,480
航天员训练
Astronaut training.

230
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,800
爆炸胶带？基普不能玩这个
Blast tape? Kip shouldn't be playing with it.

231
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,080
这东西都不应该让他看见
He shouldn't even be looking at it.

232
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,010
抱歉 巴瑞
Sorry, Barry.

233
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,550
回我办公室去
Back to my office.

234
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,920
再见 斯考奇叔叔
See ya, Uncle Scorch.

235
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,280
斯考奇
Scorch.

236
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,360
指挥中心
Mission Control,

237
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,190
我们这里出现了疯老爹危机
we've got a mad-dad situation here.

238
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,270
一点没错 我气疯了
You're darn right I'm mad...

239
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,720
飞船怎么启动了
Why is this ship on?

240
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,990
你打发我去楼上
You sent me upstairs

241
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,580
就是想偷偷去黑暗星球吧
so you could rush off to the Dark Planet.

242
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,560
没错
Yep.

243
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,520
我们不是说好了要延期吗
I thought we'd agreed to postpone the launch.

244
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,200
距发射还有三十分钟
Launch in T-minus 30 minutes.

245
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,370
斯考奇去那里太冒险了 拜托
It's too risky to send Scorch out there. Please.

246
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,520
省省吧 盖瑞 我警告你
Drop it, Gary. I'm warning you.

247
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,450
我是指挥官 没人听我的意见吗
I'm the mission controller. Does nobody here care what I think?

248
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,880
- 没  - 没人
- No.  - Not really.

249
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,770
- 没有  - 那我在这里还有什么意义
- Nope.  - Then why am I even here?

250
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,040
没事的 盖瑞 他早就驾轻就熟了
It'll be fine, Gary. He's done this a hundred times.

251
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,010
是我们已经驾轻就熟了 我们是搭档
We've done this a hundred times. We're a team.

252
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,920
我是大脑你是肌肉 你不是总这么说吗
I'm the brains and you're the brawn. That's what you always said.

253
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,000
我那么说是为了安慰你 老弟
I said it to make you feel better, little brother.

254
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,530
斯考奇 别再那么叫我了
Scorch, stop calling me that.

255
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,560
你一直在试图控制我的人生
You've been trying to control me your whole life.

256
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,160
这不就是你加入指挥中心的原因吗
Isn't that why you joined Mission Control?

257
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,050
我是在照顾你 兄弟之间就该这样
I'm looking out for you. That's what brothers do.

258
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,200
拜托 你坐在这里点按钮玩
Oh, please. You sit around here pushing buttons

259
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,560
我却在外面出生入死
while I am out there risking my neck.

260
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,440
是吗 我倒要看看没有我你要怎么办
Oh, yeah? I'd like to see you do it without me.

261
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,880
一丁点问题都没有 老弟
Any time. Any place. Little brother.

262
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,600
如果你坚持这样贫嘴耍帅哗众取宠
If you insist on going through with this idiotic macho stunt,

263
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,480
就别指望我会罩你
you can count me out.

264
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,640
不…等…你要辞职吗
Buh... wai... You're gonna quit?

265
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,480
你不能辞职 你 你被开除了
Well, you can't quit! You... you're fired!

266
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,760
你没法开除我 我已经辞职了
You can't fire me. Because I quit! Humph!

267
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,080
- 妈妈  - 你好 太空游侠
- Hey, Mom!  - Hey, space ranger.

268
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,400
来吧小子 我们去玩飞盘
Come on, boy. Let's go play frisbee.

I'm not doing anything until I see Scorch.

586
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,480
在我动真格之前你就尽管得瑟吧
You can whine till you're blue in the face,

587
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,840
这里的一切都是我说了算

宝贝 怎么了

599
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,770
没事 挺好的 只是我以为会有更多
Nothing, it's fine. I just... I was expecting more.

600
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,640
那只是个样品
Well, that was just a sample

601
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,680
还有很多 我保证
There's more coming, I promise.

我带来的足够我们一起统治宇宙

Makes sense.

616
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,730
总之 你先安顿一下

617
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,890
东西放在下铺就行
Throw your stuff on the bottom bunk.

618

624
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,560

Oh, I get it. Shut-eye. You've got one eye.

625
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,690
你拿我的一只眼开玩笑？
Are you making fun of my one eye?

626
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,730
冷静 独眼妹 别忘了这里的制度

- 你是个医生？ - 电台脱口秀治疗师
- You're a doctor?  - Radio talk show therapist.

633
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,000
跟真医生没区别 就是所有资格证都没有
Same thing without all the training, credentials or qualifications.

634
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,000
小蓝兄弟 你叫什么

盖瑞 我来找我弟弟 你见过他吗

641
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,160
我又不是在问你
Oh, it's not a question.

642
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,880
斯考奇可以帮助我们逃离

这就是五十一区的制度
That's how Area 51 works.

647
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,640
他诱拐了我们这些宇宙内最聪明的外星人
He lures the smartest aliens from across the universe

648
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,400
把我们关进监狱
and throws us in jail.

649
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,960
比如瑟曼 他以前是位教授

他用那四只手发明了触屏科技

还有独眼妹 她过去是名图书管理员

654
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,400
最重要的是 我

00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,040
我的电台秀出名之后 我发明了社交网络
After my radio show got famous, I invented social networking.

656
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,770
我有五十亿等待通过的好友请求
I've got five billion pending friend requests.

657
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,600
沙克就是这样得到此地的运转资金的
That's how Shanker bankrolls this place.

658
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,080
他窃取我们的科技对外出售

你以为人类能做出这些东西吗
You think humans could build this stuff?

662
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,400
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

663
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,360
你以为是谁发明了网络
Who do you think invented the Internet?

664
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,120
手机 电脑动画？
Cell phones? Computer animation?

665
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,850
是我们
We did!

666
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,360
谢谢 我很喜欢科技史 但我在找我弟弟

671
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,930
全宇宙只有一个生物呼噜能打这么响
There is only one creature in the universe that snores that loud.

672
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:51,600
斯考奇 斯考奇 醒醒

你邪恶的计划没有得逞

因为你是恶棍

还有一件事
Oh, and one more thing.

924
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,790

928
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,240
我…
I...

929
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:47,840
你弟弟呢
Where's your brother?

930
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:49,760
被沙克抓住了
Shanker's got him.

931
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,110
他为什么放了你
Why'd he let you go?

932
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:53,080
因为他觉得我能修好
Because he thinks I can fix it.

933
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,220
那你行吗
Can you fix it?

934
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:56,520
当然 我可是航天局工程师
Of course. I'm a BASA engineer.

935
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,000
谢天谢地
Oh, thank goodness.

936
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,070
但我觉得我不该帮他
But I don't think I should.

937
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:01,920

Say what?

938
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,930
修好了 我们就能回家
I fix it, we all go home,

939
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:05,250
是吗
right?

940
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,330
正是 有什么不对吗
Exactly. What's wrong with that?

941
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,490
沙克就会拥有宇宙内最强大的武器
Shanker ends up with the most powerful weapon in the universe.

942
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,380
无非是一支玩具枪射射小行星
So he's got a toy for shooting down asteroids.

943
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:14,920
有什么大不了
Big deal.

944
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,180
你也看到它的威力了
You saw what it can do.

945
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:18,050
谁知道下次轮到哪个星球
Who knows what he'll blow up next.

946
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,240
要是你的星球怎么办
What if it's your planet?

947
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,920
别瞎紧张 盖瑞
Don't be paranoid, Gary.

948
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,080
天才总是这样紧张兮兮的
It happens to smart people all the time.

949
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,250
太多的思绪会吞噬掉你的才智
You start thinking too much and it gets the best of you.

950
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,880
你们真的相信沙克吗
You guys actually trust Shanker?

951
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,540
我们并没有选择的权利
We're kinda low on options here, gary.

952
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:33,050
我们还能怎么办
What choice do we have?

953
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,130
我们可以拒绝
We refuse to fix it.

954
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,280
然后呢 静坐抗议吗
Then what? Stage a silent protest?

955
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,280
别开玩笑了
Come on, man!

956
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,480
你想让我们一辈子困在这里吗
You want us to be stuck in here forever?

957
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,850
我也不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do, OK?

958
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:43,760
让我静一静 思考一下
Just let me sit down for a second and think!

959
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,560
你这是静静地等死
You mean sit around and do nothing.

960
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,610
总之我们要去修好它
Well, we're gonna try to fix it.

961
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:53,450
你到底加不加入
Are you coming or not?

962
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,760
告诉你 我们不需要你
You know what? We don't need you.

963
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,640
我们走 瑟曼
Come on, Thurman.

964
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,690
剪红线
Cut the red wire.

965
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,200
不不不 剪绿线
No, no, no! Cut the green wire.

966
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,140
当我没说 我是色盲
Scratch that. I'm colorblind.

967
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:19,680
闭嘴 我需要集中精力
Quiet! I need to concentrate.

968
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,020
我的第三只眼太干扰视线
My third eye, it's messing me up.

969
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:22,880
我不干了
I can't do it!

970
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,200
就这样了 玩完了？
So that's it? Game over?

971
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,400
全体远离终极蓝核
Step away from the Blubonium.

972
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,320
专业的来了
My man!

973
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,040
瑟曼 你被开除了
Thurman, you're fired.

974
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,400
你知道应该怎么做吗
You sure you know what you're doing?

975
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:43,080
我在银河工程师考试中拿到十二点零的高分
I scored a 12.0 on my galactic engineering exams.

976
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,880
你知道这代表什么吗
Do you know what that means?

977
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,160
代表你在高中没有朋友？
You had no friends in high school?

978
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,460
代表在一个满是书呆子的银河系里
It means in a galaxy filled with nerds,

979
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:53,040
我是书呆之王
I'm their king.

980
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,090
希望能行
I hope this works.

981
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,810
- 能回家了  - 我要去交停车罚单了
- We're going home!  - It's time to pay my parking tickets!

982
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,160
盖瑞 这正常吗
Uh, Gary? Is that normal?

983
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:46,130
- 好了 瑟曼 别瞎紧张  - 好吧
- Come on, Thurman, don't be paranoid.  - OK.

984
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:50,440
盖瑞 盖瑞 盖瑞
Gary! Gary! Gary...!

985
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,520
说几句吧 盖瑞
Speech, Gary!

986
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,360
收拾行李 准备出发
Pack your stuff and be ready to go.

987
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,720
我要去把我弟弟救出来
I'm going to get my brother back.

988
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:03,000
- 这家伙想见你 长官  - 我来处理
- This one was asking for you, sir.  - Leave him with me.

989
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,520
我来带我弟弟走
I'm here for my brother.

990
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,330
盖瑞 终于肯合作了
Ah, Gary... finally a team player.

991
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,240
我按你的要求做了 修好了反应堆
I did what you asked. I fixed the reactor.

992
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,120
而且很及时
And just in time.

993
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,360
有了这些终极蓝核 我会有多强大呢
Imagine how powerful I'll be with all this Blubonium.

994
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,960
- 你是怎么…  - 你们自称是智能生命
- What? How did you...?  - You call yourself intelligent life.

995
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,240
太有意思了
These are fun.

996
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,760
我可以玩一整天
I could do that all day.

997
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,280
放我们走 你已经得偿所愿了
Let us go! You got what you wanted!

998
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,720
为什么要放你们走 反正迟早要杀死你们
Why let you go now, only to hunt you down later?

999
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,400
杀死我们？但我们为和平而来
Hunt us down? But we come in peace.

1000
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,840
没有人为和平而来
Nobody comes in peace.

1001
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,240
我六岁那年眼睁睁看着他们杀死我爸爸
I was six years old when they took my father from me.

1002
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,000
[译注：著名外星人事件发生地]
新墨西哥州罗斯维尔市 1947年

1003
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,520
想想看 小子
Think about this, champ.

1004
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,370
宇宙中有那么多星球
With that many stars out there,

1005
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:47,440
一定有智能生命的存在
there just has to be intelligent life.

1006
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,960
- 好棒 能让我看看吗  - 马上 儿子
- Golly! Can I have a look, Pops?  - In a minute, son.

1007
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,160
什么 那是什么
What? What is that?

1008
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,920
我的天啊 是飞碟
Good gravy! It's a UFO!

1009
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:58,120
你是不是忘记加油了？

1010
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:00,920
我以为你去加油了！我只带了零食！

1011
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,880
儿子 真是不敢相信
Son, you wouldn't believe it!

1012
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:06,360
我这辈子都在等待这一…
This is the moment I've been waiting for my entire...

1013
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,250
不
No!

1014
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,920
在你和你弟弟团聚之前
Before you join your brother,

1015
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,600
我还有最后一样东西给你看
there's one last thing I'd like to show you.

1016
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,320
[美国军方对于同性恋者的原则，此处Gary误以为Shanker要对他出柜]
我懂 不要问 不要说
Hey, don't ask, don't tell.

1017
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,970
[美国军方对于同性恋者的原则，此处Gary误以为Shanker要对他出柜]
我不是说头发 蠢货
Not the hair, you idiot.

1018
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,000
- 莉娜  - 你好 盖瑞
- Lena!  - Ugh. Hello, Gary.

1019
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,280
你已经见过我的未婚夫了
I see you've met my fianc?

1020
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,200
- 未婚夫  - 我们在网上认识的
- Fianc?  - We met online.

1021
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,400
你得跟上潮流 盖瑞
Get with the times, Gary.

1022
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,410
你们全家都那么喜欢多管闲事
Your whole family has been meddling in my business.

1023
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:43,720
- 诀别的时候到了 盖瑞  - 基普 琪拉
- Time to say goodbye, Gary.  - Kip! Kira!

1024
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,450
- 莉娜 他在利用你  - 他利用了所有人
- Lena, please, he's using you.  - He's using all of us.

1025
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,880
他只是嫉妒你不爱他而已
OK, he's just jealous he couldn't have you.

1026
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,280
- 什么  - 拜拜
- Hmm?  - Ta-ta.

1027
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,440
你怎么能这样做
How could you do this?

1028
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,400
你觉得我真会爱上一个外星人吗
You think I'm actually in love with an alien?

1029
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,810
等她带着我的终极蓝核离开你们的星球之后
When she leaves your planet with my Blubonium,

1030
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:01,280
我就会炸了它
I'm gonna blow it up.

1031
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,760
这还只是开始
But Baab's just the beginning.

1032
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,760
我要把这些异类星球一个个消灭掉
I'm gonna wipe out the alien infestation one planet at a time.

1033
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,120
如果你摧毁所有的智能生命星球
If you destroy every planet with intelligent life,

1034
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,970
天空中就没有星星了
you'll have no stars left in the sky.

1035
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,930
我早就过了看星星的年龄了
My stargazing days are over.

1036
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,440
放我出去
Let me out!

1037
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,840
恭喜 你自由了 才怪
Hey, congratulations. You're free! Not!

1038
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
不 你们不能这样
No, you can't do this!

1039
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,440
拜托 放我出去
Please! Let me out of here!

1040
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,600
不知道你能不能听到 但…对不起
I don't know if you can hear me, but... I'm sorry.

1041
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:57,450
我是来救你的 不是来跟你一起送命的
My plan was to get you out of here, not end up frozen beside you.

1042
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:06,720
我辜负了你 也辜负了我的家人
I failed you. I failed my family.

1043
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,880
如果没有英雄的出生入死
All the planning in the world doesn't amount to anything

1044
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,880
任何计划都只是废纸一张
without a hero to make it happen.

1045
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,800
我尽力了 弟弟
I tried, brother!

1046
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,040
对不起
I'm sorry!

1047
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,800
斯考奇
Scorch...

1048
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,040
那是盖瑞的老婆？他怎么钓到手的
So that's Gary's wife? How'd he make that happen?

1049
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,440
明白 他只会整天…
I know. Isn't he all like...

1050
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:44,240
基普 我让你快逃的 你不该回来
Oh, Kip, I told you to run. You shouldn't have come back.

1051
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,560
我不能丢下你 妈妈
I couldn't leave you, Mom.

1052
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,720
小小探险者不会弃任何人于不顾
A Junior Adventurer never leaves a man behind.

1053
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,520
基普 这不是玩游戏
Kipper, this isn't a game.

1054
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:52,990
我知道 我已经不是小孩子了
I know. I'm not a little kid anymore.

1055
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:55,000
所以我才会回来救你
That's why I came to rescue you.

1056
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:59,000
你非常勇敢 但现在我们都被困在这了
And you're very brave, but now we're both stuck in here.

1057
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,840
那是因为我还没有开始救你呢
That's because I'm not done rescuing you.

1058
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,240
爆炸胶带 你是故意让他们抓你的
Blast tape? You let them catch you.

1059
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,920
妈妈 你要保持安静
Mom, I'm gonna need you to be quiet.

1060
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,650
基普 当心
Kip, be careful.

1061
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,160
我们竟然沦落到看守柔弱妇孺
I can't believe we're guarding a lady and a kid.

1062
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,450
- 太丢人了  - 这是托儿所吗
- It's embarrassing.  - Is this a daycare?

1063
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,320
不关我的事哟
Here goes nothing.

1064
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,200
把门打开 把门打开 快点
Open the door! Open the door! Hurry up!

1065
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,840
基普 小心
Kip, look out!

1066
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,850
你们已被放倒
Consider yourselves scorched!

1067
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,080
快点 我们时间不多了
Come on, we don't have much time.

1068
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,970
我去阻止那艘飞船
I've gotta stop that ship.

1069
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:55,160
你去指挥中心藏起来 把门锁上
You go hide in Mission Control and lock that door behind you.

1070
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,480
收到
Copy that!

1071
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:00,730
这种恶棍行为不是你的风格
This whole villain thing, it's not you.

1072
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,280
压力太大会加速衰老 如果我能…
You know? And the stress is aging you, if I might be...

1073
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,520
闭嘴 你没有静音按钮吗
Shut up. Don't you have a mute button?

1074
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,600
锁上了
It's locked.

1075
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:43,680
我们政府认为小行星是地球最大的威胁
Our government thinks asteroids are Earth's biggest threat.

1076
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,970
但我们更清楚 地球最大的威胁是？
But some of us know better. The biggest threat to planet Earth?

1077
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,080
全球变暖
Global warming.

1078
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,720
外星人
Aliens.

1079
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,320
我们要先发制人 摧毁他们的星球
We will wipe out their planets before they come for us.

1080
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,680
第一个目标是 巴卜星球
Our first target? Planet Baab!

1081
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,170
是盖瑞的星球
That's Gary's planet!

1082
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:12,530
正在锁定巴卜星球 成功锁定
Targeting planet Baab. Target acquired.

1083
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:17,160
不好意思 长官 很抱歉打断你
Excuse me, sir? Sorry to interrupt.

1084
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,320
只是想知道你大概什么时候送我们回家
Just wondering approximately what time you'll be sending us home.

1085
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:24,080
他真的这么傻吗
Is he really this stupid?

1086
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,680
你能去的地方只有冷冻仓
The only place you're going is the freezer.

1087
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,040
这下你不会再乱发脾气了吧
Oh! I trust there'll be no more outbursts?

1088
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,080
不

1228
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,320
等等 你们不来绑架我们吗
Wait! Aren't you going to abduct us?

1229
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,760
这个 其实我们不干那个
Uh, we don't really do that.

1230
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:16,040
- 他们为和平而来  - 帅呆了
- They come in peace.  - Awesome.

1231
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:23,960
飞吧 蓝哥们 飞吧
Fly, blue buddy! Fly!

1232
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:32,720
- 我们要回家了  - 真棒
- Haha, we're going home!  - Yes!

1233
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,560
盖瑞 棒极了
Gary, I love it!

1234
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:36,930
打倒大反派 驾驶小飞船
Trashing bad guys, flying spaceships,

1235
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:38,720
打虎还得靠亲兄弟啊
we might be related after all.

1236
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,520
真奇怪 我觉得我会怀念这里的
You know, in some strange way, I'm gonna miss this place.

1237
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,880
- 我恨死这里了  - 有追兵
- I hate this planet!  - We got company!

1238
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,480
坐稳了
Hang on.

1239
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,560
飞得真棒 盖瑞 没想到你还有这一手
Sweet flying, Gary! I didn't think you had it in you.

1240
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,040
大家别惊慌 除了我以外
Nobody panic! I mean nobody else!

1241
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,000
我来替大家惊慌
I'll panic for all of us.

1242
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,480
我讨厌坐飞机
I don't fly well.

1243
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:15,010
我想吐的时候 就用鼻子深呼吸
When I feel queasy, I try breathing deeply through my nose.

1244
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:22,120
不要击落他们 沙克想要活口
Careful with your warning shots. Shanker wants 'em alive.

1245
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,560
有导弹
Incoming!

1246
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,250
- 我们被击中了  - 不要啊
- Oh, we're hit!  - Oh... no!

1249
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:42,600
电影里有这种情节 结局惨不忍睹
Oh, no! I've seen this in a movie! It does not end well!

1250
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:46,520
求救 这里是超新星九号 我们即将坠落
Mayday! This is Supernova-9! We're going down!

1251

- Yeah, it's me, Dad!  - Where's Mom?

1257
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,280
找个大人来 我们有麻烦了
Put a grown-up on, bud, we're in trouble.

1258
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,240
这里只有我一个人 爸爸
I'm the only one here, Dad.

1259
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,480
基普 情况紧急 我们即将坠落
Kipper, this is serious. We're going down.

1260
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,130
不 不会的
No, you're not.

1261
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,760
基普 你要干吗
Kip, what are you doing?

1262
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:17,360
超新星九号 转入远程协助模式
Supernova-9, you are go for remote assistance.

1263
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:21,690
好 基普 这跟玩遥控飞船模型一样
OK, Kip, this is just like flying your remote control ship.

1264
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,410
什么 这跟玩模型一点都不像
What? This is nothing like his remote control ship!

1265
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,680
稍微往左一点
Just a little to the left.

1266
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,250
左过头了 左过头了
Too much left! Too much left!

1267
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,520
驾驶员是个菜鸟 大家自求多福吧
We got a student driver? Every man for himself.

1268
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:42,840
我们要撞崖了 快拉升
Ah! We're gonna hit that cliff! Pull up!

1269
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:47,280
打掉他们的引擎 让他们迫降
Take out their engines. Let's force them to land.

1270
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:51,280
- 他们开火了  - 我们完蛋了
- They're shooting!  - We're not gonna make it!

1271
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,040
我能搞定 爸爸 相信我

1278
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,330
- 好  - 我们成功了

1279
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:18,400
回头见 王八蛋
See ya later, suckers!

1280
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,520
指挥中心 飞行技术真了得

大家都在 全部获救
Everyone is onboard and accounted for.

Dad, there's something coming up behind you!

1287
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,320
什么
What?

1288
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:48,200
盖瑞 我们的帐还没算完呢
Gary, I'm not finished with you!

1289
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,640
是沙克
It's Shanker!

1290
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,400
他穿了我的特工制服
He's got my mission suit.

1291
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,920
我稍微改造了一下 喜欢吗
I made some modifications. You like them?

1292
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,000
怎么回事 你们怎么不动了
What's going on? Why aren't you moving?

1293
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,520
我们被困在牵引光波里 你得把我们弄出去
We're caught in a tractor beam. You've gotta get us out of it!

1294
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,280
没反应 飞船会烧毁的
It's not working. We're burning up!

1295
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,770
我们必须把光波击断
We gotta knock off that tractor beam.

1296
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:15,490
没错 盖瑞 怎么击断
Nice one, Gary. How do we do that?

1297
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,170
从光源处击断
We take it out at the source.

1298
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,240
你是说下去那里
You mean go down there?

1299
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:30,280
理智点 盖瑞 你这是让我去送死
Be logical, Gary. You're asking me to jump with no chance of survival.

1300
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,960
我没让你做任何事情
I'm not asking you to do anything.

1301
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,600
盖瑞

1302
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,240
- 他成功了  - 加油 盖瑞

1303
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,960
放开我兄弟
Get your hands off my brother!

1304
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:59,090
- 斯考奇 你来干什么  - 我们是搭档
- Scorch, what are you doing?  - We're a team, brother!

1305
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:02,440
- 不记得了吗  - 救命
- Don't you remember?  - Aah! Help!

1306
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,800
伙计 我们正在煽情呢
Hey, pal, we're having a moment here.

1307
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,000
把你的脸从我手上拿开
Get your face out of my hand!

1308
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,440
别揪我头发
Let go of my hair!

1309
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,880
快点
Hurry up!

1310
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,680
这就是死期了
I guess this is it.

1311
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,120
我们是对好搭档
We were a good team!

1312
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:36,200
知道吗 我一直很钦佩你
You know, I always looked up to you.

1313
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:40,320
- 你钦佩我？ - 我认真的
- You looked up to me?  - I'm serious.

1314
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:43,370
有个好老婆 好儿子
Great wife, great kid.

1315
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,330
我总想着有一天也能拥有这些
I always thought I could do that one day.

1316
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:49,640
你一定会是个好爸爸
You would've been a great dad.

1317
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,760
- 盖瑞  - 怎么了 老弟
- Hey, uh, Gary?  - Yeah, brother?

1318
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,600
抱歉 我开除了你
I'm sorry for firing you.

1319
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:01,610
明明是我辞职了
Actually, I quit.

1320
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,760
怎么…
Huh? What the...?

1321
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,930
- 盖瑞  - 怎么
- Gary!  - What...?

1322
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:24,160
是你们 谢谢
You! Thank you.

1323
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,840
不用谢
Don't mention it.

1324
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,720
- 你们会说话？ - 当然
- You can talk?  - Of course.

1325
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,640
- 偶尔说一说  - 时不时来几句
- Occasionally.  - From time to time.

1326
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:36,000
为什么救我们 你们不是疯将军的人吗
Why did you save us? I thought you worked for General Crazy.

1327
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,520
开始 我们很抱歉压扁了他老爸
At first, we felt bad for squishing his dad.

1328
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:41,040
后来发现他是个神经病自大狂
Turns out he was a psychopathic megalomaniac

1329
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:44,600
每天都想着怎么消灭宇宙间所有智能生命
bent on destroying every known form of intelligent life in the universe.

1330
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,410
人心隔肚皮
Who knew?

1331
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,080
你们要怎么处置他
What are you gonna do with him?

1332
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,810
- 无可奉告  - 你们知道了会做恶梦的
- Can't say.  - It'll give you nightmares.

1333
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,520
你会付出代价的
You're gonna pay for this.

1334
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:59,960
我告诉过你 我们为和平而来
I thought I told you, we come in peace!

1335
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,120
好疼
Ouch! Oh, wow.

1336
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:06,000
- 第一次出拳吧  - 没错
- First punch-out?  - Yeah.

1337
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:10,210
- 感觉不错吧  - 是啊 感觉好极了
- Feels good, doesn't it?  - Oh, yeah. Yeah, feels great.

1338
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:17,800
刚才太帅了 我本想跟着跳的
That was amazing! I would've jumped, too,

1339
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,960
但貌似你俩已经完全镇住场面了
but it looked like you guys had everything under control.

1340
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:21,920
这小不点太好玩了
This little guy's great.

1341
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,760
- 能留着养吗  - 放我下来
- Can we keep him?  - Put me down!

1342
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,680
我们回家吧
Let's go home.

1343
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:29,570
好吧
All right!

1344
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,840
回家的感觉真好
Ah, it's good to be home.

1345
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,040
指挥中心 请求着陆
Mission Control, bring us in.

1346
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,680
看你的六点钟方向 超新星九号
Check your six, Supernova-9.

1347
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,930
- 你好 亲爱的  - 琪拉 你怎么来了
- Hiya, honey!  - Kira? How did you...?

1348
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,600
那是我老婆
That's my wife!

1349
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:05,200
盖瑞 你怎么钓到那样的美女的
Oh, Gary, how'd you hook that up?

1350
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,520
我一直觉得你是个…
I always thought you were a little...

1351
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:11,330
这是什么意思 每个人都这么说
What does that mean? Everybody always says that.

1352
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:13,680
问倒我了
Beats me.

1353
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:16,320
和斯考奇一起 意外早已是家常便饭
I've come to expect the unexpected working with Scorch,

1354
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,280

1357
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:28,920
斯考奇 你是最棒的

别再逞英雄了 行吗
No more hero stuff for a while, OK?

1364
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,770
开什么玩笑 我连家门也不想出了
Are you kidding? I'm never leaving the house again.

1365
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:52,010

You were awesome out there, just like your uncle.

1370

你一定会成为伟大的航天员的

像我爸一样
