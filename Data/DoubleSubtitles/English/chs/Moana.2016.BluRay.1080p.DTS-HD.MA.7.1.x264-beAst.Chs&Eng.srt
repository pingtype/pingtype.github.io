2
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,580
混沌初开时
In the beginning.

3
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,000
世界只是一片汪洋
There was only ocean.

4
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,950
然后海岛之母特菲提来到了
Until the "Mother Island" emerged.

5
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,620
人间
Te Fiti.

6
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,380
特菲提之心有着世间最伟大的法力
Her heart held the greatest power ever known.

7
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,280
它能够创造生命
It could create life itself!

8
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,550
于是特菲提创造了人间的一切
And Te Fiti share it with the world.

9
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,610
可是后来 有人想要得到特菲提之心
But in time, some began to seek Te Fiti's heart.

10
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,130
他们相信只要得到了它
They believed if they could possess it.

11
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,400
也就有了创造万物的法力
The great power of creation would be theirs.

12
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,770
有一天
And one day...

13
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,550
这些人中最勇敢的一位
The most daring of them all...

14
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,750
飘洋过海去寻找这颗心
Voyaged across the vast ocean to take it.

15
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,150
他是个主宰风和海的半神
He was the demigod of the wind and sea.

16
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,100
他是个勇士
He was a warrior ...

17
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,860
也是个变形者
A trickster!

18
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,030
他那充满魔力的鱼钩法杖
A shape shifter who could change form.

19
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,100
能让他变化无穷
With the power of his magical fish hook.

20
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:07,250
他的名字叫毛伊
And his name was Maui!

21
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,820
她的心被偷走了以后
But without her heart.

22
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,090
特菲提开始瓦解
Te Fiti began to crumble.

23
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,540
并释放出了可怕的黑暗势力
Giving birth to a terrible darkness.

24
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,800
在逃跑的路上
Maui tried to escape.

25
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,340
毛伊遇到了火恶魔恶卡
But was confronted by another, who sought the heart.

26
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,420
恶卡也在谋求特菲提之心
Te Ka! A demon of Earth and Fire.

27
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,140
毛伊被从天空击落
Maui was struck from the sky!

28
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,310
从此了无踪迹
Never to be seen again.

29
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,430
他那神奇的鱼钩法杖
And his magical fish hook ...

30
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:18,100
和特菲提之心一起沉入了大海
And the heart of Te Fiti, were lost to the sea.

31
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,470
即使在一千年后的今天
Where even now, a thousand years later.

32
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,420
恶卡和海里的恶魔依然妄图找到那颗心
Te Ka and the demons of the deep still hunt for the heart.

33
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,820
那些隐藏的黑暗势力仍在四处流窜
Hiding in a darkness that will continue to spread...

34
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,190
赶走了我们的鱼群
Chasing away our fish!

35
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,800
霸占了一座又一座的海岛
Draining the life from island after island!

36
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,970
迟早有一天
Until every one of us.

37
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,190
我们大家都难逃他们的魔爪
Is devoured by the blood-thirsty jaws.

38
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,130
注定要被他们吃掉
Of inescapable death!

39
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,720
但在那之前
But one day...

40
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,870
会有人把那颗心找回来
The heart will be found.

41
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,260
他将扬帆起航
By someone who would journey beyond our reef.

42
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,710
找到毛伊
Find Maui.

43
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,940
带他跨越整个大海
Deliver him across the great ocean...

44
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,320
归还特菲提之心
To restore Te Fiti's heart.

45
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,160
拯救全人类
And save us all.

46
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,760
好了好了 谢谢你妈妈
Thank you mother, that's enough.

47
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,680
爸爸
Papa...

48
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,870
放心 谁都不可能离开这的
No one goes outside the reef.

49
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,330
这里非常安全
We are safe here!

50
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,960
这没有黑暗势力 这没什么怪兽
There is no darkness. There are no monsters.

51
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,970
- 怪兽！怪兽！ - 没有怪兽 没有怪兽
- Monster! Monster! Monster!  - There's no monster... no monsters!

52
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,540
是黑暗势力
It's the darkness!

53
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,550
什么也没有 岛外面只有暴风雨
No, there is nothing beyond our reef but storms!

54
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,610
- 和汹涌的大海  - 我要吐了
- And rough seas!  - I gotta throw up!

55
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,600
只要我们大家都待在岛上
As long as we stay on our very safe island.

56
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,670
就会没事的
We'll be fine!

57
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,160
传说的都是真的
The legends are true.

58
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,010
总得有人去冒险
Someone will have to go!

59
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,710
妈妈
Mother...

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,860
莫图鲁尼就是天堂
Motunui is paradise!

61
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,900
谁会愿意离开这？
Who would want to go anywhere else?

62
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,730
莫阿娜
Moana!

63
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,240
你在这干什么 莫阿娜 真把我吓坏了
There you are Moana, what are you doing? You scared me!

64
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,690
我真想回去那
But I want us to go back.

65
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,750
我知道 知道
I know, I know...

66
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,690
以后不要再到海边去了
But you don't go out there.

67
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,460
那里很危险
It's dangerous.

68
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,000
莫阿娜 来啊
Moana, come on...

69
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,120
回村子去
Let's go back to the village.

70
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,910
你早晚也会成为一位伟大的酋长
You are the next great chief of our people.

71
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,940
你还会做很多伟大的事 我的小宝贝
And you do wonderous things, my little Minnow.

72
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,370
没错 不过
Oh yes, but first...

73
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,390
你首先要知道自己是属于哪的
You must learn where you're meant to be.

74
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:58,720
她来了
Moana...

75
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,910
大家 让开
Make way... Make way.

76
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,960
莫阿娜 你明白吗
Moana, it's time you knew.

77
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:08,030
这地方什么都有物资充裕
The village of Motunui is all you need.

78
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,130
我们舞伴在练习
The dancers are practicing

79
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,340
随着古老的舞曲
They dance to an ancient song.

80
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,720
古老的旋律比新的歌动听
Who needs a new song? This old one's all we need

81
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,780
保护传统是我的使命
This tradition is our mission.

82
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,210
这担子责任不轻
And Moana there's so much to do.

83
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,320
不要被树根绊倒 路上小心
Don't trip on the taro root. That's all you need.

84
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,280
分享所有的东西
We share everything we make.

85
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,570
有说有笑做个工具
We joke and we weave our baskets.

86
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,120
捕鱼的船渐渐靠近
The fishermen come back from the sea.

87
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,390
- 它在那里  - 不要走失
- I wanna see.  - Don't walk away.

88
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,790
莫阿娜你不要忘记
Moana stay on the ground now.

89
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,770
我们未来伟大领袖就是你
Our people will need a chief and there you are...

90
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,470
到那一天
There comes a day.

91
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,790
没人陪伴在你身边
When you're gonna look around.

92
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,010
你就会明白最快乐的是你家
And realize happiness is where you are.

93
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,710
你看看这些椰子
Consider the coconut!

94
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,180
这一片树林
Consider it's tree...

95
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,670
椰子的每一个部分
We use each part of the coconut.

96
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,880
都有价值
That's all we need.

97
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,310
椰子壳可以做鱼网
We make our nets from the fibers.

98
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,200
椰汁可口又清凉
The water is sweet inside.

99
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,260
椰子树干能把火生
We use the leaves to build fires.

100
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,060
叶子能够做好菜
We cook up the meat inside.

101
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,050
你看看这些椰子
Consider the coconuts!

102
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,470
树干和叶子多的是
The trunks and the leaves!

103
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,930
这小岛给我们所需
The island gives us what we need.

104
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,050
- 不要离去  - 就在这里
- And no one leaves.  - That's right we stay.

105
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,500
安全又有丰厚物资
We're safe and we're well provided.

106
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,450
带领我们美好未来
And when we look to the future...

107
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,610
全靠你
There you are.

108
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,320
直到一天
You'll be okay.

109
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,660
你会了解人生意义
In time you'll learn just as I did.

110
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:30,940
人生的快乐在你的家
You must find happiness right where you are!

111
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,000
我爱随着海浪舞蹈
I like to dance with the water.

112
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,060
高高低低的浪花
The undertow and the waves.

113
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,990
那海水非常顽皮
The water is mischievous, ha!

114
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,020
它脾气没法估计
I like how it misbehaves.

115
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,480
他们都说我太疯狂
The village may think I'm crazy.

116
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,290
也说我不守故址
Or say that I drift too far.

117
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,480
但我很了解自己 我有追寻
But once you know what you like. Well, there you are.

118
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,930
有其父必有其女
You are your father's daughter.

119
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,110
我自己注意
Stubbornness and pride.

120
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,380
他的教导虽有道理
Mind what he says, but remember.

121
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,450
你要听从你的心
You may hear a voice inside..

122
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,780
到那时它会呼唤你 去追寻那颗星星
And if the voice starts to whisper To follow the farthest star

123
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,450
会明白哪个才是真正的你
Moana, that voice inside is who you are

124
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,170
爸爸
Dad!

125
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,220
我只是在看看那些船
I was only looking at the boats.

126
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,970
我没打算要上去
I wasn't gonna get on them.

127
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,570
来吧
Come on.

128
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,670
跟我一起去个地方
There's something I need to show you.

129
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,690
从你出生时起 我就一直想带你来这的
I've wanted to bring you here from the moment you opened your eyes.

130
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,300
这里是个神圣的地方
This is a sacred place.

131
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,220
每代酋长都来过
A place of Chiefs.

132
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,210
总有一天
There will come a time

133
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,190
你也会站在这里 给这座山
When you will stand on this peak and place...

134
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,410
添上一块石头的
A stone on this mountain.

135
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,750
像我一样
Like I did.

136
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,320
我的父亲
Like my father did.

137
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:51,030
他的父亲 每一代酋长都这样做
And his father and every chief that has ever been.

138
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,390
你要知道
And on that day...

139
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,800
当你把石头放上去的时候
When you're at your stone.

140
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,390
这整座岛又会变得高一点
You will raise this whole island higher.

141
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,380
你是我们族人的未来 莫阿娜
You are the future of our people, Moana.

142
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,680
他们不在别的地方
And they are not out there.

143
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,630
就在我们这里
There are right here.

144
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,320
是该你为他们做事的时候了
It's time to be who they need you to be.

145
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,540
- 椰子可以做捕鱼网  - 可以做捕鱼网
- We make our nets from the fibers.  - We weave our nets from the fibers

146
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,480
- 椰汁又清凉  - 里面有甜蜜椰汁
- The water is sweet inside.  - The real taste of tree's inside.

147
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,480
- 我们用叶子把火生  - 我们一起来把歌唱
- We use the leaves to build fires.  - We sing these songs in our choirs.

148
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,540
- 能够做好菜  - 一天忙碌生活
- And cook up the meat inside.  - We have mouths to feed inside.

149
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,850
- 村民都相信我们  - 对啊
- The village believe in us.  - That's right!

150
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,850
村民都相信
The village believe!

151
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,140
这小岛给我们所需
The island gives us what we need.

152
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,560
不用离去  就在这里
And no one leaves!  So here I'll stay.

153
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,780
与我们的家人在一起
My home, my people beside me.

154
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,840
我的未来就在这里
And when I think of tomorrow.

155
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,080
我的家
There we are.

156
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,640
我的带领
I lead the way.

157
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,990
也需要你们的指引
I'll have my people to guide me.

158
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,130
一起把未来去建立
We'll build our future together.

159
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,110
我的家
Where we are.

160
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,050
每一条路的终点都是
'Cause every path leads you back to.

161
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,290
我的家
Where you are.

162
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,870
- 在这里最快乐的是  - 我的家
- You can find happiness right...  - Where you are

163
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,460
我的家
Where you are....

164
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,520
尽管我加盖了很多树叶 可每次下雨还是会漏水
Every storm, this roof leaks no matter how many fronds I add.

165
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,270
修好了
Fixed!

166
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,750
不是叶子的问题
Knot the fronds!

167
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,840
是风把柱子吹偏了
Wind shifted the post.

168
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,430
这猪肉真不错
That's good pork!

169
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,540
不是说你
Oh, I mean...

170
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,420
我的意思是
No, I wasn't ...

171
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,320
什么？他们在叫我 我得走了
What? They're calling me! So I gotta...

172
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:22,380
拜拜
Bye!

173
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,810
你真棒
You're doing great.

174
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,110
还没结束吗？
Is it done yet?

175
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,540
就快结束了
So close.

176
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,160
我很好奇为什么那只鸡
I'm curious about that chicken.

177
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,470
喜欢吃石头
Eating the rock!

178
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,790
它看起来好像已经完全
I think he seems to lack the basic intelligence required for

179
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,590
丧失理智了
Pretty much everything.

180
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,270
也许我们应该
Should we maybe just...

181
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,580
拿它做盘菜？
Cook him?

182
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,590
有时候我们需要透过现象看本质
Sometimes our strengths lie beneath the surface

183
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,590
不过不一定
Far beneath

184
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,120
能看得到
In some cases.

185
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,330
但我相信它肯定不会像看上去那么傻
But I'm sure there's more to Hei-hei than meets the eye!

186
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,760
这是今天摘的
It's the harvest.

187
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,300
早上我在剥椰子的时候
This morning,I was husking the coconuts and...

188
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,100
那么…
Well...

189
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:34,140
我们应该砍掉这些病树
we should clear the diseased treesand we will start a new grove.

190
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,150
就在那儿
There!

191
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,740
谢谢 莫阿娜
Thanks, Moana.

192
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,610
她可真棒
She's doing great!

193
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,470
这很适合你
This suits you.

194
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,330
酋长
Chief!

195
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,230
我相信你应该看看这个
There's something you need to see.

196
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,790
这是我们在东礁湖设的捕鱼篓
Our traps in the east lagoon.

197
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,770
最近能捕到的鱼越来越少了
They're pulling out less and less fish.

198
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,910
那就换个地方试试
Then we'll rotate the fishing grounds.

199
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,980
试过了 还是没有鱼
We have. There's no fish.

200
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,660
那就去岛的那一边试试
Then we'll fish the far side of the island.

201
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,480
也试过了
We tried.

202
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,240
迎风的那边？
The windward side?

203
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,440
还有背风的那边
And the leeward side.

204
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,750
浅礁 沟渠
The shallows, the channel.

205
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,620
整个礁湖我们都试过了
We've tried the whole lagoon!

206
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,900
就是找不到鱼
They're just... gone.

207
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,420
好吧 你们有没有试过换换鱼饵呢？
Well, have you tried using a different bait?

208
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,050
我觉得不是鱼饵的问题
I don't think it's the bait.

209
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,350
情况好像越来越糟了
It seems like it's getting worse and worse.

210
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,750
当然 我能理解你在担心什么
Of course I understand you have reason to concern.

211
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,400
我会和长老们商量的
I will talk to the counselor.

212
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,780
- 我们一定会…  - 我们…
- I'm sure we ca...  - What if...

213
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,390
为什么不能出海捕鱼
We fished beyond the reef.

214
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,170
从来没有人出过海
No one goes beyond the reef.

215
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,970
我知道 但如果礁湖里真的没有鱼了
I know! But if there are no fish in the lagoon...

216
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,730
- 莫阿娜  - 还有那么大一片海呢
- Moana!  - And there's a whole ocean...

217
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,350
我们要遵守规则
We have one rule!

218
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,040
可那是有鱼的时候制定的规则
An old rule when there were fish!

219
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,760
它能确保我们的安全
A rule that keeps us safe!

220
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,800
- 可是 爸爸  - 而不是像你说的那样
- But dad...  - Instead of endangering our people

221
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,660
让大家以身犯险
So you can run right back to the water!

222
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,670
我还以为你放弃了离岛的念头
Every time, I think you're past this.

223
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,080
所有人都不许离开这座岛
No one goes beyond the reef!

224
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,400
你不该当着你爸爸的面
Well, it's not like you said it in front of your dad

225
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,950
提出海的事情
Standing on a boat.

226
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,150
我说的是出海捕鱼
I didn't say go beyond the reef.

227
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,270
又不是要去冒险
Because I want to be on the ocean.

228
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,850
但你还是想去
But you still do.

229
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,170
- 你爸爸生你的气是因为  - 是因为他不懂我
- He's hard on you, because...  - Because he doesn't get me.

230
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,660
是因为他也曾跟你一样
Because he was you.

231
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,310
对大海着迷
Drawn to the ocean.

232
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,030
想去海上
Down by the shore.

233
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,540
莫阿娜 他曾经驾着独木舟
He took a canoe, Moana.

234
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,720
绕过那片礁石
He crossed the reef.

235
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,820
驶入了一片危险的海域
And found an unforgiving sea.

236
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,350
哪里的浪像山一样高
Waves like mountains.

237
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,790
他最好的朋友非要跟他一起出海
His best friend begged to be on that boat.

238
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,190
但你爸爸没能救回他
Your dad couldn't save him.

239
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,460
现在他不想让你重蹈覆辙
He's hoping he can save you.

240
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,860
有时候我们总想着
Sometimes, who we wish we were

241
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,220
要做些大事
What we wish we could do

242
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,100
却忘了该做些什么
It's just not meant to be.

243
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,440
我每天总喜欢眺望这海洋
I've been staring at the edge of the water.

244
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,340
没有尽头的彼方
Long as I can remember.

245
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,440
却不明白为什么
Never really knowing why.

246
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,240
也许你希望我听你的话
I wish I could be the perfect daughter.

247
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,470
我也曾经努力的尝试
But I come back to the water.

248
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,020
我还是回到这海洋
No matter how hard I try.

249
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,790
每一个转弯 每一个路段
Every turn I take, every trail I track.

250
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,790
每一次选择 每一次失望
Every path I make, every road leads back.

251
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,390
不怕多困难 那熟悉的地方
To the place I know where I cannot go.

252
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,790
是我的渴望
Where I long to be.

253
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,040
我听到地平线的那一边
See the line where the sky meets the sea?

254
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,520
呼唤我
It calls me.

255
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,370
谁会知道
And no one knows.

256
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,540
能走多远
How far it goes.

257
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:08,840
乘着风 迎着浪 扬着帆
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me.

258
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:12,190
终会知道
One day I'll know.

259
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,990
我要走的路不管有多远也好
If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go.

260
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:22,620
虽然在这海岛每一个人仿佛开心没有忧愁
I know everybody on this island seems so happy, on this island

261
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,020
所有事都被安排
Everything is by design

262
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:33,740
虽然海岛上的每一个人都有他们的责任
I know everybody on this island has a role, on this island.

263
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,670
也许我有自己主张
So maybe I can roll with mine.

264
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,470
我可以带领 让你们坚强
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong.

265
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,320
也可以妥协 不再有期望
I'll be satisfied if I play along.

266
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,040
我心中想起另一个声音
But the voice inside sings a different song.

267
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,570
我不能自己
What is wrong with me?

268
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,140
那海岸在闪烁很耀眼
See the light as it shines on the sea?

269
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,820
的光芒
It's blinding.

270
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,640
谁会知道
But no one knows.

271
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,770
海有多深
How deep it goes.

272
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:06,320
仿佛它在等待我的回应
And it seems like it's calling out to me.

273
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,620
我在这里
So come find me.

274
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,170
请告诉我
And let me know.

275
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,690
我应该期待什么是未来
What's beyond that line, will I cross that line?

276
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,340
在那地平线的另一边
See the line where the sky meets the sea?

277
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,740
呼唤我
It calls me.

278
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,520
谁会知道
And no one knows.

279
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,720
能走多远
How far it goes.

280
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:31,690
乘着风 迎着浪 扬着帆勇敢前行
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me.

281
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,740
总会知道
One day I'll know.

282
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:41,490
能走多远
How far I'll go.

283
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,590
别担心 胖胖
Okay, Pua.

284
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,190
相信我
I can do this.

285
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,270
出海肯定能捕到更多的鱼
There's more fish beyond the reef.

286
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,710
我相信肯定能的
There's more beyond the reef.

287
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,460
没那么糟嘛
Not so bad!

288
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,750
胖胖
Pua!

289
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,200
不管发生了什么事
Whatever just happened.

290
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,150
就说是胖胖干的
Blame it on the pig!

291
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,230
奶奶
Grandma!

292
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,330
你会告诉爸爸吗？
Are you gonna tell dad.

293
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,540
我是他妈
I'm his mom.

294
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,960
不用事事都跟他汇报
I don't have to tell him anything.

295
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,470
他说得对
He was right.

296
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,060
海上很危险
About going out there.

297
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,650
我也应该接任酋长了
It's time to put my stone on the mountain.

298
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:41,970
好呀
Okay!

299
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,070
那就回村子去
Well, then head on back

300
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,780
把你的石头放上去
Put that stone up there.

301
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,730
你为什么不劝阻我呢
Why aren't you trying to talk me out of it?

302
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,580
你说了那是你想做的事
You said that's what you wanted.

303
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,010
没错呀
It is.

304
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,400
等我死了
When I die.

305
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,420
我想要变成一条黄貂鱼
I'm going to come back as one of these.

306
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,660
不然我背上的刺青就白刺了
Or I chose the wrong tattoo.

307
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,870
你今天怎么怪怪的？
Why you're acting weird?

308
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,140
我是村里的怪奶奶啊
I'm the village crazy, lady.

309
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,620
这才是我嘛
That's my job.

310
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,940
如果你有什么话想跟我说
If there's something you want to tell me.

311
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,040
就直说吧
Just tell me.

312
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,830
您有什么话想跟我说吗？
Is there something you want to tell me?

313
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,270
你想听我说什么啊？
Is there something you want to hear?

314
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,420
我们族人的故事你都已经听过了
You've been told all our people stories.

315
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,180
可这个除外
But one.

316
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,130
这是哪儿啊？
What is this place?

317
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:44,810
你真以为我们的祖辈从来没有出过海吗？
Do you really think our ancestors stayed within the reef?

318
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,670
里面有什么呢？
What's in there?

319
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,260
有你
The answer.

320
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,590
一直在苦苦寻找的答案
To the question you keep asking yourself.

321
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,580
你想要做什么样的人
Who are you meant to be.

322
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,230
走进去
Go inside.

323
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,230
敲敲鼓
Bang the drum.

324
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,620
你就能找到答案
And find out.

325
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,940
对了 敲敲
Bang the drum.

326
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,960
看太阳高高在上
We read the wind and sky.

327
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,530
风吹散云彩
When the sun is high.

328
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:06,350
我们在大海航行 迎着风前进
We sail the length of the seas on the ocean breeze.

329
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,860
在夜里数每颗星能找到方向
At night we name every star. We know where we are.

330
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,140
知道我是谁
We know who we are.

331
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,390
我是谁
Who we are.

332
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,990
定好了目的地
We set a course to find.

333
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:26,100
每一次出行找寻新天地
A brand new island everywhere we roam.

334
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:30,930
家乡的模样放心里
We keep our island in our mind.

335
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,390
时间到了就回家
And when it's time to find home.

336
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,100
千山万水
We know the way.

337
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,510
我们去探索每一个符号
We are explorers reading every sign.

338
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,650
这里有我们的祖先
We tell the stories of our elders.

339
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,050
古老的故事与传承
In a never ending chain.

340
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:59,960
千山万水
Nae ko hakilia. We know the way!

341
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,180
我们是航海者
We were voyagers.

342
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:13,110
我们是航海者
We were voyagers!

343
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,080
后来发生了什么？
Why'd we stop?

344
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:16,710
是毛伊
Maui!

345
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,820
在他偷走了特菲提之心后
When he stole from the Mother Island.

346
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,380
黑暗降临到了人间
Darkness fell.

347
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,300
恶卡苏醒了
Te Ka awoke.

348
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:27,900
海底的怪兽吞噬了渔船
Monsters lurked and boats stopped coming back.

349
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,570
为了族人的安全 历代酋长都下令
To protect our people, the ancient chiefs

350
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:31,730
禁止航海
Forbid voyaging.

351
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:35,160
于是人们渐渐忘记了自己是航海者的后代
And now we have forgotten who we are.

352
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,540
然而黑暗势力仍在不断扩张
And the darkness has continued to spread.

353
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,260
他们赶走了我们的鱼群
Chasing away our fish.

354
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,100
霸占了
Draining the life

355
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,860
一座又一座海岛
From island after island.

356
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,670
我们的岛
Our island

357
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,420
但是 终有一天
But one day

358
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:58,510
有人会重新扬帆起航
Someone will journey beyond our reef.

359
00:26:58,910 --> 00:26:59,820
找到毛伊
Find Maui.

360
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,930
并带他跨越整片大海
Deliver him across the great ocean.

361
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,690
归还特菲提之心
To restore the heart of Te Fiti.

362
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,810
那天我都看到了你
I was there that day.

363
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,720
大海选择了你
The ocean chose you!

364
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,150
我还以为那只是个梦
I thought it was a dream.

365
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,140
不是梦
Nope!

366
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,380
我们的祖先相信毛伊就在那里
Our ancestors believed, Maui lies there.

367
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:39,980
在钩形星座的尽头
At the bottom of his hook.

368
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,600
朝着它的方向走 你就能找到毛伊
Follow it, and you will find him.

369
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:44,380
但是
But...

370
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,710
大海为什么会选中我呢？
Why would it choose me?

371
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,380
我连怎么驾船出海都不会
I don't even know how to make it pass the reef.

372
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,780
但我知道谁能教我
But I know who does.

373
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,060
庄稼都变黑了
The crops are turning black!

374
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,110
那鱼呢？
What about the fish?

375
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,660
- 现在整座岛都是这样  - 安静
- This is happening all over the island.  - Please. please.

376
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:07,780
- 请安静  - 我们该怎么办？
- Settle down!  - What are you going to do?

377
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,850
我们会开垦更多田地
We will dig new fields.

378
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,010
- 找到解决方法的  - 我们能战胜黑暗势力
- We will find a way to...  - We can stop the darkness!

379
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,550
拯救我们的小岛
Save our island!

380
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,190
我发现一个山洞里有船
There's a cavern boats!

381
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,940
很大的船
Huge canoes!

382
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,930
我们可以驾着那些船找到毛伊
We can take them, find Maui

383
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,390
让他归还特菲提之心
Make him restore the heart.

384
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,260
我们是航海者
We were voyagers.

385
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:22,890
我们应该重新出海
We can voyage again!

386
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,190
你说过族人需要我们的保护
You told me to help our people.

387
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,340
只有这样才能保护他们
This is how we help our people!

388
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,160
爸爸
Dad?

389
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,210
你要干什么？
What are you doing?

390
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,920
我早就应该把那些船全都烧掉
I should've burned those boats a long time ago!

391
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:36,830
不 不要
No! Don't!

392
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,290
我们必须找到毛伊
We have to find Maui.

393
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,710
然后归还特菲提之心
We have to restore the heart.

394
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,100
根本没有什么心
There is no heart!

395
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,400
这就是一块石头
This...this is just a rock!

396
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,200
不
No!

397
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,040
酋长
Chief!

398
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,650
你母亲不行了
It's your mother!

399
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:10,750
妈妈
Mother.

400
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,390
现在还能做什么？
What can be done?

401
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,180
快去
Go.

402
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,400
奶奶
Grandma.

403
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,590
快去
Go.

404
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,270
现在不行
Not now.

405
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,580
我不能
I can't.

406
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,160
你必须去
You must!

407
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,390
大海选择了你
The ocean chose you!

408
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,110
- 朝着钩状星座的方向走  - 奶奶
- Follow the fish hook.  - Grandma.

409
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,690
等你找到毛伊
And when you find Maui.

410
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,390
你就揪着他的耳朵
You grab him by the ear!

411
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:58,740
告诉他
You say...

412
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:02,280
我是莫图鲁尼岛的莫阿娜
I am Moana of Motunui!

413
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,980
快上船
You will board my boat!

414
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,090
跨越整片大海
Sail across the sea!

415
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,970
归还特菲提之心
And restore the heart of Te Fiti!

416
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,750
我离不开您
I... I can't leave you.

417
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:21,130
无论你在哪里 我都与你同在
There is no way you could go, that I won't be with you.

418
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:35,130
快去
Go!

419
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,880
我听见地平线另一边在呼唤我
There's a line where the sky meet the sea. And he calls me.

420
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,780
谁会知道
But no one knows.

421
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:59,020
能走多远
How far it goes.

422
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:04,330
曾经的不知所措的日子已经远离
All time wondering where I need to be is behind me.

423
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,440
全靠自己
I'm on my own

424
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:10,950
我往前走
Towards unknown!

425
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:14,140
每一个转弯 每一个路段
Every turn I take. Every trail I track.

426
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,870
都是我选择 不能有遗憾
It's a choise I make. Now I can't turn back.

427
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,440
过去多伟大
From a great unknown.

428
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:23,050
未来独自闯 我渴望那里
Where I go alone. Where I long to be.

429
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:37,000
她光芒照亮了这海洋 呼唤我
See her light of the night. in the sea, she calls me.

430
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,720
让我知道
And yes, I know.

431
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,170
能走得到
That I can go.

432
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,400
在天空的月亮与晚风陪我前行
There's a moon in the sky and the wind is behind me.

433
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,010
终会知道
So now I'll know.

434
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:58,110
能走多远
How far I'll go!

435
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:16,480
我是莫图鲁尼岛的莫阿娜
I am Moana Motunui.

436
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,970
快上船
You will board my boat.

437
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,690
我要带你跨越整片大海
Sail across the sea!

438
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:22,090
归还特菲提之心
And restore the heart of Te Fiti.

439
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,610
我是莫图鲁尼岛
I am Moana.

440
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,050
的莫阿…娜
Of Motu... nui.

441
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,140
憨憨？
Hei-hei?!

442
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:05,770
别害怕
It's okay.

443
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,300
没事的
You're alright.

444
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,700
看到了吧？
See?

445
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,700
我们走吧
There we go.

446
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,650
多棒的海水啊
Nice water.

447
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,100
大海是我们的朋友
The ocean is a friend of mine.

448
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,560
憨憨
Hei-hei?

449
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,890
憨憨
Hei-hei!

450
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,890
别动
Stay!

451
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:43,490
好了
Okay.

452
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:44,690
下一站
Next stop.

453
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:45,850
毛伊
Maui.

454
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,630
我是莫图鲁尼岛的莫阿娜
I am Moana of Motunui.

455
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,380
快上船
You will board my boat.

456
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,390
我要带你跨越整片大海
Sail across the sea.

457
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,950
归还特菲提之心
And restore the heart of Te Fiti.

458
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:11,160
我是莫图鲁尼岛的莫阿娜
I am Moana... of .. Mo..tu....

459
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,130
快上船
Board my boat!

460
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,060
不
Oh, no!

461
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,240
不 不
No ... no... no...no!

462
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:25,770
不
No!

463
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:38,730
大海
Ocean?

464
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:42,460
你能帮帮我吗？
Can I get a little help?

465
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:46,390
糟了
No... no.

466
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:48,820
拜托
Please.

467
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,330
快点儿
Come on!

468
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:02,780
救命
Help me!

469
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,170
救命
Please!

470
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,550
什么情况
What?!

471
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,940
我说了我需要帮助
I said help me!

472
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,260
但你让大浪来袭击我的船？
And wrecking my boat?!

473
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,190
这也叫帮忙
Not helping!

474
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,540
就让你被鱼群臭死吧
Fish pee in you... all day!

475
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:02,790
那么
So...

476
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,290
毛伊？
Maui?

477
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,190
毛伊
Maui!

478
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,500
毛伊 主宰风和海的半神
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea

479
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,700
我是莫图鲁尼岛的莫阿娜
I am Moana of Motunui!

480
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,180
请上船吧
You will board my boat!

481
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:36,660
不
No!

482
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,470
快上船
You will board my boat!

483
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:38,980
没错
Yeah!

484
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,260
我是莫图鲁尼岛的莫阿娜
Hi, I'm Moana of Motunui.

485
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,730
- 快上…  - 船
- You will board my...  - Boat!

486
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,350
这有艘船
A boat!

487
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:49,910
老天爷赐给我一艘…
The Gods have given me a...

488
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,130
毛伊
Maui

489
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,360
万能的变形者
Shape shifter.

490
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,440
主宰风和海的半神
Demigod of the wind and sea.

491
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,790
- 我是莫图鲁尼岛的莫阿娜  - 男人们的英雄
- I am Moana of Mo...  - Hero of Men.

492
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,660
什么？
Wha..What?

493
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,370
应该说毛伊是万能的变形者
It's actually Maui, shape shifter.

494
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,820
主宰风和海的半神
Demigod of the wind and sea!

495
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,070
男人们的英雄
Hero of Men.

496
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,890
不好意思打断你了 从头开始吧 人类的英雄
I interupted. From the top. Hero of Men.

497
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,350
开始
Go!

498
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,690
- 我是莫…  - 等等 等等
- I am Mo...  - Sorry, Sorry, Sorry, Sorry.

499
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,750
所有人
And women.

500
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,040
包括男人和女人 所有人才对
Men and women. Both! All!

501
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,970
这个可不分男女
Not a guy-girl thing.

502
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,980
你知道的 毛伊是所有人的英雄
You know? Maui is a hero to all!

503
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,790
再来一遍吧
You're doing great.

504
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:31,880
什么？
What?

505
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,490
- 不 我来这儿是…  - 我知道
- No! I came here to ...  - Of course, of course.

506
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,750
好吧 好吧
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

507
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,190
毛伊对他的崇拜者总是很有耐心的
Maui always has time for his fans.

508
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,020
这种用鸟来写字的方式
When you use a bird to write with

509
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,060
叫做瞅瞅
It's called "tweeting".

510
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,690
我明白的 英雄可不是想见就能见到的
I know, not every day, you get a chance to meet your hero.

511
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,900
你可不是我的英雄
You are not my hero!

512
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,730
我来这儿也不是为了让你在我的桨上签名
And I'm not here so you can sign my oar!

513
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:59,010
我来这是因为你偷走了特菲提之心
I'm here because you stole the heart of Te Fiti!

514
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,410
现在我要你上船
And you will board my boat.

515
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,500
跟我一起把它还回去
Sail across the sea and put it back!

516
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,130
好吧
Yeah.

517
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,220
听起来你好像不太喜欢我
It almost sounded like you don't like me.

518
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,710
但这是不可能的 因为我已经被困在这里
Which is impossible because I got stuck here.

519
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,850
一千年了 就是为了
For a thousand years, trying to get the heart...

520
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,590
给你们凡人寻找那颗心
As a gift for you, mortals...

521
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:19,030
好让你们拥有创造生命的力量
So you could have the power to create life itself!

522
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,170
所以我猜你原本想说的是
Yeah, so what I believe you're trying to say.

523
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,420
- 谢谢  - 谢谢？
- Is thank you.  - Thank you?

524
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,350
- 不用谢  - 什么 不
- You're welcome.  - What? No, no, no.

525
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,850
我没有 我不会
I .. I didn't ... I wasn't ...

526
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,570
- 我为什么要说谢谢  - 好啦好啦
- Why would I ever say... I mean...  - Okay, okay, okay...

527
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:33,190
我知道发生了什么
I see what's happening, yeah.

528
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,800
面对这伟大的神明很奇妙
You're face to face with greatness and it's strange.

529
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:39,460
都不知道该怎么反应
You don't even know how you feel.

530
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,940
这是很可爱的
It's adorable!

531
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:44,000
我发觉人类一直没有改变
Well, it's nice to see that humans never change.

532
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:47,570
现在让你开眼界
Open your eyes let's begin.

533
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,520
要看清楚是我毛伊 请冷静
Yes, it's really me, It's Maui. Breathe it in.

534
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,750
我这完美的发型 身型
I know it's a lot the hair, the body!

535
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,670
当你盯着这优质神明
When you're staring at a Demigod

536
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,950
我只能说一句
What can I say?

537
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,140
不客气
Except you're welcome.

538
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:05,310
把潮汐 晴天送你
For the tides, the sun, the sky.

539
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:09,230
这很简单 很容易 不客气
Hey, it's okay. It is okay. You're welcome.

540
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,670
我只是一个普通硬汉子 嘿
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy, Hey!

541
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:15,970
我用手指把天空托起
Hey, what has two thumbs and pulled up the sky.

542
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,030
当你蹒跚前行有我扶持
When you were waddling yay high. This guy!

543
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,160
在寒冷夜里
When the nights got cold.

544
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,870
取暖的火都被偷走
Who stole you fire from down below?

545
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,560
有我在这里哟
You're looking at him, yo!

546
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:30,070
噢 是我让太阳升起
Oh, also I lasso'd the sun.

547
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,090
不客气
You're welcome.

548
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,690
让你多点开心日子
To stretch your days and bring you fun.

549
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:37,390
我能把狂风驾驭
Also I harnessed the breeze.

550
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,620
不客气 让船航行 树叶落地
You're welcome, to fill your sails and shake your trees.

551
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,670
这不过是小意思 不客气
So what can I say except You're welcome.

552
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,870
我让大地从海中耸立
For the islands I pulled from the sea.

553
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,770
不需要膜拜的意思 不客气
There's no need to pray, it's okay. You're welcome.

554
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,120
我只是单纯的做我自己
I guess it's just my way of being me.

555
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,320
不客气
You're welcome.

556
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,130
不客气
You're welcome.

557
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,420
啊 回头想一想
Well, come to think of it.

558
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,480
我其实可以一口气的
Kid, honestly I can go on and on.

559
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,310
把所有大自然的现象都解释
I can explain every natural phenomenon.

560
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,860
潮汐 草地 大地
The tide, the grass,  the ground.

561
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,660
都是我毛伊所做的好事
Oh... that was Maui just messing around.

562
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,420
我把海鳗狠狠地除掉
I killed an eel, I buried its guts.

563
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,170
种一颗树让你得到椰子
Sprouted a tree, now you got coconuts.

564
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,160
明不明白
What's the lesson?

565
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,160
有没有新启示
What is the takeaway.

566
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:15,920
就是当毛伊生气 你快点回避
Don't mess with Maui when he's on the breakaway.

567
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,570
你看我皮肤上的印记
And the tapestry here in my skin.

568
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,200
都是彰显胜利的标志
Is a map of the victories I win.

569
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,160
我到哪里 哪里就出现好事
Look where I've been, I make everything happen.

570
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,140
过去小气的小毛伊已变好脾气
Look at that mean mini Maui just tikitty tappin'

571
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,890
还是这句 告诉你 不客气
Well anyway, let me say, You're welcome

572
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:33,920
我把这世界变美丽
For the wonderful world you know.

573
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:37,910
这很简单 很容易 不客气
Hey, it's okay... it's okay. You're welcome

574
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,040
我现在想起来我要出行
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go.

575
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,290
给你机会说声不客气
Hey, it's your day to say You're welcome.

576
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,220
我要借用你的船
Cause I'm gonna need that boat.

577
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:52,410
要扬帆而去远地 不客气
I'm sailing away... away. You're welcome.

578
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:55,450
我除了漂浮 什么都最棒
Cause Maui can do everything but float.

579
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,710
不客气
You're welcome.

580
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,940
不客气
You're welcome.

581
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,010
谢谢你
And thank you!

582
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,210
放我出去
Hey, let me out!

583
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:08,650
你这个卑鄙的大骗子
You lying, slimy, son of a...

584
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:11,380
不用谢
You're welcome.

585
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:20,570
不
No!

586
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:22,660
我可不想跟着个小孩去特菲提岛
I'm not going to Te Fiti with some kid.

587
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:23,630
我还得找回我的鱼钩
I'm gonna get my hook.

588
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,930
你有一个 但我没有 毛伊不能没有鱼钩
You have yours. And I'm not Maui without mine.

589
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,360
好了 去我背后安静会儿
Okay, talk to the back.

590
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:35,720
旅途小点心
Boat snack!

591
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:06,170
再见啦 讨厌的石头岛
Good riddance you filthy pile of pebbles!

592
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,200
不
Oh, no, no, no.

593
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,620
别那样看着我
Don't look at me like that.

594
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:10,770
那个山洞挺好的 她肯定喜欢
It's a beautiful cave, she's gonna love it.

595
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,360
而且我会好好
And I'm going to love you.

596
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,070
享用你的
In my belly.

597
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,630
不过得先让你长点肉
Now let's fatten you up, drumstick!

598
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,520
真是精彩的一跳啊
I could watch that all day.

599
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,820
好了 这座岛是你的了
Okay, enjoy the island!

600
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:46,910
- 毛伊号 出发  - 不
- Maui, out!  - No!

601
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:47,720
停下
Stop!

602
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,760
你必须把那颗心还回去
Hey! You have to put back the heart!

603
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:08,400
什么时候回来的
Did not see that coming.

604
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,360
我是莫图鲁尼岛的莫阿娜
I am Moana of Motunui.

605
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,830
这是我的船
This is my canoe.

606
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,990
你必须跟我去特…
And you will journey to...

607
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:21,630
好了 摆平了 我们得走了
All right, get over it. We gotta move.

608
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,170
她又回来了
And she's back.

609
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:27,970
我是莫图鲁尼岛的莫…
I am Moana of Motunu...

610
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,150
- 你叫莫阿娜 对吧  - 没错
- It was Moana, right?  - Yes.

611
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:37,900
你必须把这颗心还回去
And you will restore the heart.

612
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:51,230
好吧 我认输
All right, I'm out.

613
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:56,770
够了
Oh, come on!

614
00:43:57,810 --> 00:43:59,320
你到底怎么回事
What is your problem?

615
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,790
- 你很怕它吗？ - 不
- Are you afraid of it?  - No.

616
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,420
我可没害怕
No. I'm not afraid...

617
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:12,130
别多管闲事 不然我把你塞进腋窝
Stay out of it or you're sleeping in my armpit.

618
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,600
你也闭嘴 这根本不是什么心
You stop it. That is not a heart.

619
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,850
而是个诅咒 我一拿到它
It is a curse. The second I took it

620
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:18,700
就被击落到海里
I got blasted out of the sky

621
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,730
还弄丢了我的鱼钩
And I lost my hook!

622
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:21,310
让它离我远点儿
Get it away from me.

623
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:23,140
你是说这个吗？
Get this away?

624
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,340
我是个半神 知道吗？
I'm Demigod, okay?

625
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,940
你在这样 我就揍你了
Stop that! I will smite you!

626
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:28,500
你真的想挨打？
You wannna get "smote"?

627
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,760
挨揍？
"Smoten"?

628
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,530
听着 那玩意儿根本没有创造生命的法力
Listen, that thing doesn't give you power to create life.

629
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,430
它是死神的追踪器
It's a homing beacon of death.

630
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:37,890
如果不丢掉它 可怕的事情就会接踵而来
If you don't put it away, bad things are gonna come for it.

631
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:40,180
来找这个吗 特菲提之心？
Come for this? The heart?

632
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,310
你说的就是这颗心吗
You mean this heart right here!

633
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:43,970
快来拿啊
Come and get it!

634
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,340
你这样会害死我们的
You are gonna get us killed.

635
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,550
不 我要带你去特菲提岛
No, I'm gonna get us to Te Fiti.

636
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:48,910
让你亲手把它还回去
So you can put it back.

637
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:49,720
谢谢
Thank you.

638
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,190
不用谢
You're welcome.

639
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:57,770
卡卡穆拉
Kakamora.

640
00:44:57,790 --> 00:44:58,810
卡卡什么？
Kaka... what?

641
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,490
杀人不眨眼的小海盗们
Murdering little pirates.

642
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,600
不知道他们来这儿做什么
Wonder what they're here for?

643
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,960
看起来挺可爱嘛
They're kind of cute.

644
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,470
大海 拜托了 帮帮我们
Ocean do something, help us!

645
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:33,990
大海帮不了你 你得靠自己
The ocean doesn't help you. You help yourself!

646
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:36,450
拉紧升降索 绑好支索
Tighten the halyard. Bind the stays!

647
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:38,950
你不会驾船？
You can't sail?!

648
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,370
我
I...

649
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:43,010
我是自学的
I am self taught?

650
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,910
你不是会变身之类的吗？
Can't you shape shift or something?!

651
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:56,820
没看到我没有鱼钩吗？
Do you see my hook?

652
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:58,840
没有鱼钩我什么都变不了
No magic hook, no magic powers.

653
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:26,510
他们的船变成了很多条船
Their boat is turning into more boats!

654
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,320
没错 那是我干的
Yup! I just did that.

655
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:55,500
不不
No, no, no, no!

656
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,600
憨憨
Hei-hei!

657
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,960
毛伊 他们拿走了那颗心
Maui! They took the heart!

658
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:17,430
那是只鸡
That a chicken.

659
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:18,780
那颗心就在
The heart is in the...

660
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,220
我们得把它抢回来
We have to get him back!

661
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,320
毛伊
Maui!

662
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:43,620
那儿呢 就在那儿
There! Right there!

663
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:46,180
你转向了 你要干什么
You're turning?! What are you doing?!

664
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,610
逃跑啊
Escaping.

665
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,510
- 那颗心怎么办  - 别管它了 你拿不回来的
- The heart!  - Forget it, you'll never get it back.

666
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,780
况且你已经有了一颗更好的了
Beside, we got a better one.

667
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:53,770
嘿
Hey!

668
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,670
没有浆我还怎么划船
What do I gonna steer with?!

669
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,010
他们会杀了你的
They're just gonna kill you!

670
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:03,160
椰子小人儿
Coconuts.

671
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,570
拿到了
Got it!

672
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:52,180
嘿
Hey!

673
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:11,240
我们成功了
We did it!

674
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,840
恭喜你捡回一条命 姑娘
Congratulations, on not being dead, curly.

675
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:15,850
你让我大吃一惊
You surprise me.

676
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:18,820
但别指望我会碰那玩意儿
But I'm still not taking that thing back.

677
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:21,220
要到达特菲提岛
You wanna get to Te Fiti.

678
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,600
必须穿洋过海
You gotta go through a whole ocean of bad.

679
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:24,930
还可能会碰上恶卡
Not to mention Te Ka.

680
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:27,380
那个火山怪兽？
Lava monster?

681
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,790
你打败过火山怪兽吗？
Ever defeat a lava monster?

682
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,570
没有
No.

683
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,100
你呢？
Have you?

684
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,810
我可不想和一个凡人一起去找死
I'm not going on a suicide mission with some mortal.

685
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,380
没有我 你不可能把那颗心放回原处
You can't restore the heart without me.

686
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:48,300
而我已经拒绝了你
And me says no.

687
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:51,750
我要去找鱼钩
I'm getting my hook.

688
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:53,280
讨论结束
End of discussion.

689
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,920
你会成为大英雄的
You'd be a hero.

690
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:06,580
那才是你应该做的事情对吧
That's what you're all about, right?

691
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,580
小姑娘 我已经是大英雄了
Little girl, I am a hero.

692
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,970
过去可能是
Maybe you were but now...

693
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:15,360
现在你就是那个偷走了特菲提之心
Now you're just the guy who stole the heart of Te Fiti.

694
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:17,500
让整个世界陷入灾难的小偷
The guy who cursed the world!

695
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:20,890
你已经不是英雄了
You're no one's hero.

696
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:23,590
不是吗？
No one?

697
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,670
但是 如果你把这个放回去
But, put this back.

698
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,700
你就拯救了全世界
Save the world.

699
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,260
就会成为所有人的英雄
You'd be everyone's hero.

700
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,750
毛伊
Maui! Maui! Maui!

701
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,310
你好伟大
You're so amazing!

702
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:51,090
没有鱼钩 我们到不了特菲提岛
We'd never make it without my hook.

703
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,770
因为我们不是恶卡的对手
Not pass Te Ka.

704
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,700
那就先去找你的鱼钩
Then we get your hook.

705
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,960
找到鱼钩 打败恶卡
We get you hook, take out Te Ka.

706
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:56,930
最后归还特菲提之心
Restore the heart.

707
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,970
除非你不想做回
Unless you don't wanna be

708
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:06,790
从前的毛伊 那个主宰风和海的半神 所有人的大英雄
Maui, Demigod of the Wind and Sea, Hero to all

709
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,110
首先我们去找鱼钩
First, we get my hook.

710
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:13,800
然后拯救全世界
Then save the world.

711
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:15,080
成交？
Deal?

712
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:16,230
成交
Deal.

713
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:21,780
就是想再试试
Worth a shot.

714
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:24,770
好吧 我们往东走
Okay, we go east.

715
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:26,910
去螃蟹怪的巢穴
To the lair of Tamatoa.

716
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:32,080
我的鱼钩肯定被那个眼尖的食底泥动物捡到了
If anyone has my hook, it's that beady-eyed bottom feeder.

717
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,110
教我驾船吧
Teach me to sail.

718
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,980
我的任务就是带你漂洋过海
My job is to deliver Maui across the great ocean.

719
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:53,140
所以我
I should...

720
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:56,440
我应该来驾船
I should be sailing.

721
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:58,910
这叫寻路 小公主
It's called Wayfinding, Princess.

722
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:01,290
寻路可不像驾船那么简单
And it's not just sails and knots.

723
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:04,220
你不仅要知道目的地在哪儿
It's seeing where you're going in your mind.

724
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:05,460
还要清楚当前的位置
Knowing where you are.

725
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,800
和已经走过的地方
By knowing where you've been.

726
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:10,630
好吧 不过我可不是什么公主
Okay, first, I'm not a princess.

727
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,330
我是酋长的女儿
I'm the daughter of the chief.

728
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:13,450
- 没什么区别  - 有区别
- Same difference.  - No.

729
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:16,110
如果你穿条裙子 再带只小宠物
If you wear a dress, and you have an animal sidekick.

730
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:17,560
你就是公主了
You're a Princess.

731
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:19,020
所以你不是寻路人
You're not a wayfinder.

732
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:20,630
也永远不会成为寻路人
You will never be a wayfinder.

733
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:22,420
你不可能成为寻路
You will never be a way...

734
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:28,550
不会吧
Really?

735
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:30,200
拿我的屁股当靶子
Blow dart in my butt cheek.

736
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,510
真是个小混蛋
You are a bad person.

737
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,970
你只要能讲话 就能教我
If you can talk, you can teach.

738
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,300
寻路法则
Wayfinding.

739
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,140
第一课 开始吧
Lesson one. Hit it!

740
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:47,960
拉帆脚索
Pull the sheet.

741
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:49,880
不是那根
Not the sheet.

742
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:51,040
不对
No.

743
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:51,960
不对
Nope!

744
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:53,220
不对
Nope!

745
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:54,460
不对
No.

746
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,160
那根你已经试过了
Tried that one already.

747
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,660
我让你做的是观星
You're measuring the stars.

748
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,630
不是和空气击掌
Not giving the sky a high five.

749
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:08,740
如果洋流是温暖的 就说明你的航向没错
If the current's warm, you're going the right way.

750
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:11,980
是冷的
It's cold.

751
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:14,420
等等 现在变热了
Wait, it's getting warmer.

752
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:17,800
太恶心了
That is disgusting!

753
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:19,190
你是故意的
What is wrong with you?!

754
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:36,970
我们到了
We're here?

755
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:40,300
看到了吧 都说了我能行的
See? Told you I can do it!

756
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:49,960
莫图鲁尼
Motunui.

757
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,470
我又回来了
I'm home?

758
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:57,420
莫阿娜
Moana!

759
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:58,240
爸爸
Dad?

760
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:00,510
莫阿娜
Moana!

761
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:01,680
妈妈
Mom?

762
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:04,260
救命
Help!

763
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:07,390
不
No!

764
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:08,800
莫阿娜
Moana!

765
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:13,240
美容觉睡得还好吧？
Enjoying your beauty rest?

766
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:16,450
要知道真正的寻路人从不睡觉
You know, a real wayfinder, never sleeps.

767
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:19,170
这样才能不偏离航线
So they actually get where they need to go.

768
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,300
打起精神来 小不点儿
Muscle up buttercup!

769
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:24,270
我们到了
We're here.

770
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,090
你确定你的鱼钩在他手里
You sure this guy's gonna have your hook?

771
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,860
螃蟹怪 我确定
Tamatoa? Oh, hell have it.

772
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:31,170
他就是个海底清道夫
He's a scavenger.

773
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:33,590
什么东西都要捡 还以为那样会很酷
Collects stuff, things that makes him look cool.

774
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:36,500
而且对于螃蟹怪来说
And for Tamatoa?

775
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:39,940
我的鱼钩肯定是最酷的收藏品
Trust me, my hook is the coolest collectible.

776
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:42,980
他住在那上面？
And he lives up there?

777
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:46,330
不 不
Oh, no, no, no...

778
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:47,800
那里只是一个入口
That's just the entrance

779
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,280
通往拉罗泰
To a Lalotai.

780
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,340
拉罗泰？
Lalotai?

781
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:53,240
怪兽王国？
Realm of Monsters?!

782
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:56,320
所以我们要去怪兽王国？
We're going to the Realm of Monsters?

783
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:57,210
我们？
We?

784
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:57,990
不
No.

785
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:58,660
我自己去
Me.

786
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:01,660
你就跟另外一只鸡一起待在这里
You are gonna stay here with the other chicken.

787
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:06,330
明白我的意思吧 来击个掌
That's what I'm talking about, give me some!

788
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,680
来嘛 我说得多好啊 你没听明白
Come on, that was a good one, how do you not get it?

789
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:11,830
我是说她是个胆小鬼 就跟船上的那只鸡一样
I called her a chicken, there's a chicken on the boat.

790
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:14,780
我知道她是个人 但那可不是 还是算了吧
I know she's human! But that's not the... You know what? Forget it.

791
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:16,600
别管它了 我不想跟你解释
Forget it! I'm not explaining it to you.

792
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:18,530
说明白就不好笑了啊
'Cause then it's not funny.

793
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,050
听着
So...

794
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:34,380
酋长的女儿
Daughter of the chief.

795
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:36,210
我觉得你应该待在村子里
I thought you stayed in the village.

796
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:38,210
哄哄小孩 做做家务什么的
You know, kissing babies and things.

797
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,290
我只是不太理解
Hey, I'm just trying to understand

798
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,930
为什么你的族人要让你
Why your people decided to send...

799
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,130
该怎么说呢
How do I phrase this?

800
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:45,990
来冒险
You!

801
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:46,710
我的族人
My people...

802
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:50,410
他们没让我来 让我来的是大海
Didn't send me. The ocean did.

803
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:54,060
大海？好吧 选了一个不会开船的
The ocean? Makes sense! You're what? Eight?

804
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:54,860
小不点儿
Can't sail?

805
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:56,090
真够明智的
Obvious choice.

806
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:58,140
它选择了我
It chose me.

807
00:55:58,780 --> 00:55:59,840
自有它的原因
For a reason.

808
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:01,640
如果大海够聪明的话
If the ocean's so smart

809
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,390
它为什么不直接把特菲提之心送回去呢
Why didn't it just take the heart back to Te Fiti itself?

810
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:06,220
或者帮我找回鱼钩
Or bring me my hook?

811
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,260
我想它肯定是疯了
The ocean's straight up pooky dooks!

812
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,290
不过它选择你应该没错
But I'm sure it's not wrong about you.

813
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:14,580
你可是天之骄子
You're the chosen one.

814
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,170
大海选择你肯定有它的理由
The ocean chose you for a reason.

815
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:36,550
如果你要唱歌的话 我真的会吐的
If you start singing, I'm gonna throw up.

816
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:39,790
我没看到什么入口
So, not seeing entrance.

817
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:44,220
因为只有拿人献祭以后 入口才会出现
Yes, because it only appears after a human sacrifice.

818
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,490
开玩笑的
Kidding!

819
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,380
真没幽默感
So serious!

820
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,760
不用担心 它比看起来要深得多
Don't worry. It's a lot farther down than it looks.

821
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:25,320
我还在降落
I am still falling!

822
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,020
你能做到的
You can do this.

823
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:30,630
跳
Go!

824
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:53,920
毛伊完美落地
And he's sticks the landing.

825
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,120
什么
What?

826
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,810
你傻了吧 她根本没下来
Dumb-dumb, she's not even here.

827
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:01,590
凡人可不敢跳进怪兽王国
No mortal's gonna jump into the realm of mon...

828
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:07,440
她
Well....

829
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:08,540
死定了
She's dead.

830
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:11,460
好了 我要去找鱼钩了
Okay, let's get my hook.

831
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,520
毛伊的鱼钩
Maui's fish hook.

832
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:15,860
是啊
Yeah!

833
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:17,590
抱歉
Sorry!

834
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:19,520
我以为你是个怪兽呢
I thought you're a monster, but...

835
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:21,280
不过我找到你的鱼钩了 你说得对
I found your hook! And you're right...

836
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,630
- 螃蟹怪的确很喜欢他的宝贝  - 老实待着
- This Tamatoa really likes his treasure. - Stay!

837
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,100
什么？不
What? No!

838
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,620
- 是我找到了你的  - 听着
- I... I'm the one who found...  - Listen...

839
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:28,030
一千年来
For a thousand years...

840
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:30,650
我一直留着这帅气的发型
I've only been thinking of keeping this hair silky

841
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:33,440
盼望着找回我的鱼钩 然后东山再起
Getting my hook, and being awesome again.

842
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:35,980
我可不想让一个凡人
And it's not getting screwed up by a mortal.

843
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:37,020
进到怪兽的洞里
Who has no business

844
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,430
去破坏我的好事
Inside of a monster's cave except...

845
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:42,770
除非
Except...

846
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,300
她可以做诱饵
Maybe as bait.

847
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:45,940
什么？
Huh?

848
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:49,620
这里真漂亮啊
Wow! The shiny, glittery cave.

849
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,230
就像我一样
And just like me.

850
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:54,070
到处都是闪闪发光的宝贝
It is covered in sparkly treasure.

851
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:55,570
闪呀 闪呀
Sparkle, sparkle

852
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:57,630
- 闪呀  - 你的演技真是太差了
- Sparkle. - You're not selling it.

853
00:59:57,790 --> 00:59:59,950
这也太蠢了 我要直接去拿鱼钩
This is stupid! I'm just gonna walk up and get it.

854
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:01,840
不等你靠近 他就会把你杀了
You go up there, he will kill you.

855
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:03,040
乖乖按计划来
Just stick to the plan.

856
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:06,820
等他出现了 你就缠住他
Oh, when he shows up, keep him distracted.

857
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,510
让他跟你吹吹牛
Make him talk about himself.

858
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:10,840
他很喜欢吹嘘自己有多厉害
He loves bragging about how great he is!

859
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:12,920
那你们俩应该合得来
You two must get along as well!

860
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,520
在我扯断他的腿之前的确是的
No. Not since I ripped off his leg.

861
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,080
你扯断了他的
You ripped off his le...

862
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:17,970
毛伊
Maui?

863
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,480
看我找到了什么
What have we here?

864
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,850
这是个闪闪发光的
It's a sparkly, shiny.

865
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,240
等等
Wait a minute...

866
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:37,110
是个人呢
It's a human!

867
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:38,860
你来这里干什么？
What are you doing down here?

868
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,100
这里可是怪兽王… 看着我的一只眼睛 宝贝
In the realm of the mons... Just pick an eye, babe.

869
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:44,680
你晃得我都忘了要说什么了
I can't... I can't concentrate on what I'm saying

870
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,620
别晃 别晃了
If you keep... Yep, pick one, pick one!

871
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:49,800
你真是个有意思的小玩意儿
You're a funny looking little thing, aren't you?

872
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:51,290
别碰 这是我奶奶给的
Don't! That's my grandma's.

873
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,620
“这是我奶奶的” 我奶奶被我吃了
"That's my grandma's" I ate my grandma!

874
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:56,520
那花了我整整一周 因为她实在是太大了
And it took a week 'cause she was absolutely humongous.

875
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,730
你在这里做什么？
Why are you here?

876
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,100
我很崇拜你
'Cause you're amazing!

877
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:04,980
我们人类都知道海底有一只
And we mortals, have heard of the tale of the crab.

878
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:06,270
很了不起的大螃蟹
Who became a legend!

879
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:08,480
所以我只是想知道
And I just had to know...

880
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:12,620
你是怎么变得这么
How you being so crab...

881
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:14,290
了不起的？
-oulous?

882
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:19,150
你就想让我讲讲我自己的故事吗？
Are you just trying to get me to talk about myself?

883
01:01:20,190 --> 01:01:21,800
如果真是这样
Because if you are...

884
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,240
我很乐意讲讲哦
I will gladly do so.

885
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:26,780
让我唱给你听
In song form!

886
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:32,510
我不是一直那么出众与美丽
Well, Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam.

887
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,280
我曾经是小蟹一只
I was a drab little crab once..

888
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:39,020
我明白蛤蜊都可以很开心
Now I know, I can be happy as a clam.

889
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:41,690
因为我非常的美丽
Because I'm beautiful, baby.

890
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:45,730
古老的一句 相信你自己
Did your granny say listen to your heart.

891
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:48,520
只要闪亮 不靠外表
Be who you are on the inside.

892
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:52,020
我用四个字可以推翻这论据
I need three words to tear her argument a part.

893
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:53,650
这是谎言
Your granny lied.

894
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:58,550
我宁愿要闪亮 就像沉没海底海盗的宝藏
I'd rather be shiny like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck.

895
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:02,460
擦亮甲板 就让它闪亮
Scrub the deck and make it look shiny.

896
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:05,220
就像珠宝挂在贵妇的身上
I will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck

897
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:08,030
让我来告诉你
Just a sec, don't you know?

898
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:11,970
小鱼很愚蠢 看见闪亮的就追逐
Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb They chase anything that glitters

899
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:16,590
初级班 噢 看他们游过来
Beginners. Oh, and here they come, come, come.

900
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:18,920
向最闪亮的我追逐
To the brightest thing that glitters.

901
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:22,360
我的晚餐 这免费大餐
Mmm, fish dinners. I just love free food.

902
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:25,510
你是海洋大餐
And you look like seafood

903
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:28,660
- 不  - 大蟹饼
- No!  - Hey! Crab cake.

904
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,740
我回来了
I'm back!

905
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:37,620
毛伊登场了
It's Maui time!

906
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,550
想看点什么 伙计
What do you say, little buddy.

907
01:02:42,610 --> 01:02:44,210
巨鹰？如你所愿
Giant hawk? Coming up!

908
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,750
毛伊
Well, well, well....

909
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,150
你小子不是会变形的吗
Little Maui's having trouble with his look.

910
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:03,950
这是什么假冒迷你神
You little semi-demi-mini-god.

911
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:08,260
哎呀 你的表现太差劲了 振作点行吗
Ouch! What a terrible performance. Get the hook! Get it?

912
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,320
你的法术已经失灵了
You don't swing it like you used to, man.

913
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:14,750
我全新的开始你也有功劳
Yet I have to give you credit for my start.

914
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:17,350
还有你漂亮的纹身
And your tattoos on the outside.

915
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:21,040
跟你一样 我让自己更有魅力
For just like you I made myself a work of art.

916
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,080
藏不住 因为我太闪亮
I'll never hide, I can't.

917
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:27,930
看我闪闪发亮像钻石那样
I'm too shiny! Watch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough.

918
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:31,210
看我全身是如此闪亮
Strut my stuff, my stuff is so shiny.

919
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:34,020
再多军队 我也不会觉得多
Send your armies but they'll never be enough.

920
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:37,030
我的外壳好坚强
My shell's too tough, Maui man.

921
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:38,740
你能试一试
You could try, try, try...

922
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:41,190
可是讨价还价太麻烦
But you can't expect a demigod.

923
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,540
这样子太麻烦
To beat a decapod.

924
01:03:42,770 --> 01:03:43,520
对不对
Look it up!

925
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:47,490
生命到尽头现在我要撕开小心脏
You will die, die, die. Now it's time for me to take apart.

926
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,260
你的那颗
Your aching heart.

927
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:54,780
你以为自己很重要
Far from the ones who abandoned you.

928
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:59,130
把所有的爱付出
Chasing the love of these humans.

929
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:02,420
人类他们把你抛弃
Who made you feel wanted.

930
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:05,020
你装作坚强
You try to be tough.

931
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:09,250
但你的内心其实很柔软
But your armour's just not hard enough.

932
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:14,050
毛伊 现在我要把你收拾
Maui! Now it's time to kick your hiney.

933
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:17,180
没有谁比我更闪亮
Ever seen someone so shiny?

934
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:20,130
没有关系 最后机会再看一次
Soak it in cause it's the last you'll ever see.

935
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,880
我就是注定那么的闪亮
C'est la vie mon ami, I'm so shiny!

936
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:26,960
在我吃掉你之前 你想不想
Now I'll eat you so prepare your final plea.

937
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:28,420
求求我
Just for me.

938
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:32,480
你才不会如此闪亮
You'll never be quite as shiny

939
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:38,430
你只是善良 不闪亮
You wish you were nice and shiny

940
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:40,130
嘿
Hey!

941
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,530
我有个宝贝给你
I got something shiny for you.

942
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,890
特菲提之心
The heart of Te Fiti.

943
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,640
你跑不了了
You can't run from me.

944
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:50,420
跑吧
Oh, you can?

945
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,020
你总能给我惊喜
You keep surprising me.

946
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:56,970
不过就你那两条细腿也跑不了多远
It's only so far you can get on these two little legs.

947
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:02,970
创造生命的法力
The power of creation!

948
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:04,620
就要属于我了
For a crustacean!

949
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:06,870
它在哪儿？
Where is it? Where is it?

950
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:08,380
我们快走
We gotta go!

951
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:10,560
那颗心怎么办
Well, what about the heart.

952
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:11,770
留给他好了
He can have it.

953
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,190
我还有一颗更好的
I've got a better one.

954
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,910
我找到了 等等
Yes, I have the ... Wait a minute.

955
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:19,050
她在贝壳上涂了
I see she's taken a barnacle

956
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:21,650
发光海藻 想要分散我的
And she's covered it in bioluminescent algae.

957
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:23,140
注意力
As a diversion.

958
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:27,440
给我回来
Come back here!

959
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:35,130
嘿
Hey! Hey!

960
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:36,850
你们喜欢我唱的歌吗？
Did you like the song?

961
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:46,640
我们还活着
We're alive!

962
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:48,420
我们还活
We're ali...

963
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,080
听着
Listen

964
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:54,070
我很感谢你在海底救了我
I appreciate what you did down there.

965
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,370
你很勇敢
Took guts.

966
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:57,370
但是 不好意思
But... I'm sorry.

967
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,270
我在跟你说真心话 可你好像并没有认真听
I'm tryin' to be sincere for once, and it feels like you're distracted.

968
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,850
- 怎么会 不可能  - 真的吗？
- No, no, no way!  - Really?

969
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,610
你看我的表情就像是看到了一个
'Cause you're looking at me like I have a ...

970
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:09,790
鲨鱼头
Shark head.

971
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:13,490
- 什么 你有个鲨鱼头吗  - 其实我
- Do you have a shark head? 'Cause I ...  - Look ...

972
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:14,790
听着 重点是
The point is ...

973
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:20,250
你只是个小女孩 小不点儿 总之 你本可以置身事外
For a little girl, child thing, whatever who had no business being down there.

974
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,250
却帮了我一个大忙
You did me a solid.

975
01:06:23,030 --> 01:06:24,340
不过你也是死里逃生
But you also almost died.

976
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:26,840
现在的我连那只愚蠢的螃蟹都打不过
And I couldn't even beat that dumb crab!

977
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:28,970
想要打败恶卡 简直是做梦
So chances of beating Te Ka, Bupkis.

978
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:32,560
所以我们肯定到不了特菲提岛
We're never making it to Te Fiti.

979
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:33,960
还是放弃吧
This mission is cursed.

980
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:36,130
不能放弃
It's not cursed.

981
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:39,900
- 鲨鱼头  - 绝对不能放弃
- Shark head.  - It is not cursed!

982
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:55,470
放弃吧
Cursed.

983
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:03,430
我只能跟你们说 我们死定了
What can I say, except we're dead soon.

984
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:05,430
我们死定了
We're dead soon.

985
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,440
你就不能再试试吗
Can you at least try?

986
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:12,470
巨鹰
Giant hawk.

987
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:18,550
没关系 我们死定了
Hey, it's okay, it's okay. We're dead soon.

988
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,500
好了 休息时间结束
All right, breaktime's over.

989
01:07:20,810 --> 01:07:22,110
- 快起来  - 为什么？
- Get up!  - Why?

990
01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:23,760
你又要长篇大论了
You're gonna give me a speech

991
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:28,160
告诉我我能打败恶卡 因为我是毛伊
Tell me I could beat Te Ka 'cause I'm "Maui"?

992
01:07:29,870 --> 01:07:30,940
给我走开 小人
Take a hike, tiny.

993
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,280
你这些刺青是怎么来的？
How do you get your tattoo's?

994
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:42,090
我每做一件事刺青就会多一块
They show up when I earn them.

995
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:44,460
那块儿是怎么来的？
How'd you earn that one?

996
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,980
上面讲的是什么？
What's that for?

997
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:49,060
那是我帮人类发现了不你市
That's a man's discovery of Nanya.

998
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:50,620
不你市是哪儿？
What's Nanya?

999
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:51,680
就是不关你事
None ya business.

1000
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:54,850
你不说我就一直问
I'll just keep asking.

1001
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,780
它是怎么来的？
What's it for?

1002
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:00,720
收起你的破桨
You need to stop doing that.

1003
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:07,540
- 走开  - 告诉我它是怎么来的
- Back off!  - Just tell me what it is?!

1004
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:08,840
我说了走开
I said back off.

1005
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,630
是不是因为它 你的鱼钩才没了法力？
Is it why your hook's not working?

1006
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,060
如果你不想说
You don't wanna talk.

1007
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:29,740
那就别说了
Don't talk.

1008
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:31,960
如果你想把我扔下船
You wanna throw me off the boat.

1009
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:33,650
那就扔吧
Throw me off.

1010
01:08:34,270 --> 01:08:37,050
你想说我根本不知道自己在干什么
You wanna tell me, I don't know what I'm doing?

1011
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:39,210
你说的没错
I know I don't.

1012
01:08:40,670 --> 01:08:43,730
我也不知道大海为什么会选择我
I have no idea why the ocean chose me.

1013
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,250
你说得对
You're right.

1014
01:08:46,430 --> 01:08:50,010
但是 我的小岛正在消亡
But my island is dying.

1015
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:53,430
我必须冒险
So I am here.

1016
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:56,890
现在只剩下我和你
It's just me and you.

1017
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:59,120
我想帮你
And I want to help.

1018
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:04,390
可你不愿意让我帮你
But I can't if you don't let me.

1019
01:09:10,030 --> 01:09:12,340
我并不是天生的半神
I wasn't born a demigod.

1020
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:14,480
我的父母都是凡人
I had human parents.

1021
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,170
他们
They...

1022
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:18,930
他们只是看了一眼
They took one look and...

1023
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:23,320
就决定要把我扔掉
And decided they did not want me.

1024
01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:26,240
他们把我丢到了海里
They threw me under the sea.

1025
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:29,760
就像什么事也没发生一样
Like I was nothing.

1026
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:34,670
不知怎么地 天神们发现了我
Somehow I was found by the Gods.

1027
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:36,600
还给了我这根鱼钩法杖
They gave me the hook.

1028
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,460
是他们让我成为了毛伊
They made me... Maui.

1029
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:44,460
之后我回到了人类当中
And back to the humans I went.

1030
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:48,610
为他们带去了海岛、火种、椰子
I gave them islands, fire, coconuts!

1031
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:51,530
他们要什么我就给什么
Anything they could ever want.

1032
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:54,620
你为他们拿了那颗心
You took the heart for them.

1033
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,600
为他们做任何事
You did everything for them.

1034
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,090
只希望能讨好他们
So they'd loved you.

1035
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:04,880
可他们永远都不满足
It was never enough.

1036
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:16,380
也许天神发现你是有原因的
Maybe the Gods found you for a reason.

1037
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:19,650
也许是大海把你带到了他们面前
Maybe the ocean brought you to them.

1038
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:23,670
因为它觉得你命不该绝
Because it saw someone who is worthy of being saved.

1039
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:28,570
但是让你成为毛伊的并不是天神
But the Gods aren't the ones who make you Maui.

1040
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,340
而是你自己
You are.

1041
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,340
好了
Okay, okay.

1042
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,200
我也爱你 伙计
I... I love you too, buddy.

1043
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:53,300
真棒
Yeah!

1044
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:19,240
下一站 特菲提岛
Next stop, Te Fiti.

1045
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:10,170
- 看什么？ - 我知道了
- What?  - I figured it out

1046
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:14,550
其实大海让我拉来那些岛屿
You know the ocean used to love when I pulled up islands.

1047
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,750
是为了让你的祖先们在航海时发现它们
'Cause your ancestors would sail our seas. Find them!

1048
01:13:18,970 --> 01:13:21,320
然后在岛上建立村庄
All those new lands, new villages...

1049
01:13:22,330 --> 01:13:24,110
所有的岛屿和村庄都因为大海而连在一起
It was the water that connected them all.

1050
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:26,570
如果我是大海
And if I were the ocean

1051
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:28,820
我也会选择一个
I think I'd be looking for a...

1052
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:31,000
卷发的酋长女儿
Curly haired, non-princess.

1053
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:33,330
让一切都从头开始
To start that again.

1054
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,310
你从来没有对我说过
That is literaly the nicest thing

1055
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:38,160
这么感人的话呢
You've ever said to me.

1056
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:41,940
也许你应该等到了特菲提岛再说
Probably should've saved it for Te Fiti.

1057
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,500
已经到了
I did.

1058
01:13:46,970 --> 01:13:48,670
莫图鲁尼岛的莫阿娜
Moana of Motunui.

1059
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:50,240
我想你
I believe.

1060
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,440
已经成功地带着毛伊
You have officially delivered Maui.

1061
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:54,460
跨越了整片大海
Across the great sea.

1062
01:13:56,130 --> 01:13:58,950
莫阿娜
Moana!  Moana!  Moana!

1063
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:01,010
你好伟大
You're so amazing!

1064
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:03,600
时间到了
It's time.

1065
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:23,190
去拯救世界吧
Go, save the world.

1066
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:47,920
毛伊
Maui!

1067
01:15:22,990 --> 01:15:23,990
你在干什么？
What... What are you doing?

1068
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:25,500
找一个更合适的入口
Finding you a better way in!

1069
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:29,570
- 我们过不去的  - 过得去
- We won't make it!  - Yes, we will!

1070
01:15:29,610 --> 01:15:30,640
- 快掉头  - 不
- Turn around!  - No!

1071
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:32,210
- 莫阿娜 停下  - 不
- Moana, stop!  - No!

1072
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:02,350
你还好吧？
Are you okay?

1073
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:05,480
毛伊
Maui?

1074
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:14,530
我说了掉头
I told you to turn back.

1075
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:18,920
我觉得我们能过得去
I thought we could make it.

1076
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:20,590
我们
We?

1077
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:23,980
我觉得我能过得去
I thought I could make it.

1078
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:27,170
我们可以修好它
We can fix it!

1079
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:28,950
鱼钩法杖是天神做的
It was made by the Gods.

1080
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:31,100
你不可能修得好
You can't fix it!

1081
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:33,370
下次小心一点就好了
Next time we'll be more careful.

1082
01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:35,970
恶卡只能待在障壁岛上
Te Ka was stuck on the barrier islands.

1083
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:37,380
它是熔岩做的
It's lava!

1084
01:16:37,390 --> 01:16:38,530
不能碰水
It can't go in the water.

1085
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:39,960
我们可以绕路过去
We can find a way around.

1086
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:42,030
我不会再去了
I'm not going back.

1087
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:46,090
什么 我们还得把那颗心放回去呢
What... We still have to restore the heart.

1088
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:47,200
我的鱼钩已经裂了
My hook is cracked.

1089
01:16:47,450 --> 01:16:49,280
再被击中一次 它就彻底毁了
One more hit and it's over.

1090
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:51,550
毛伊 你必须归还特菲提之心
Maui, you have to restore the heart.

1091
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:53,640
没有鱼钩法杖 我什么都做不了
Without my hook, I am nothing.

1092
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:54,830
不是那样的
That's not true.

1093
01:16:54,850 --> 01:16:57,110
没有鱼钩法杖 我什么都做不了
Without my hook, I am nothing!

1094
01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:10,720
我们走到今天这一步 都是因为你当初偷了这颗心
We're only here because you stole the heart in the first place.

1095
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:14,990
不 这一切都是因为大海说你
No, we're here because the ocean told you

1096
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:16,740
与众不同 而你也就当了真
You're special and you believed it,

1097
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:21,190
我是莫图鲁尼岛的莫阿娜
I am Moana of Motunui.

1098
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,540
- 快上船 我要带你  - 再见了 莫阿娜
- You will board my boat.  - Goodbye, Moana.

1099
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:26,150
- 跨越整片大海  - 我不能为了
- Sail across the sea,  - I'm not killing myself

1100
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:27,760
证明自己而搭上我的性命
So you can prove you're something you're not!

1101
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:29,490
归还特菲提之心
And restore the heart of Te Fiti!

1102
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:31,390
大海选择了我
The Ocean chose me!

1103
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:34,050
它选错了人
They chose wrong.

1104
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:45,540
毛伊
Maui!

1105
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:01,970
为什么要带我来这里
Why did you bring me here?

1106
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,640
你选错了人
I'm not the right person.

1107
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,740
去找个更合适的人吧
You have to choose someone else.

1108
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:19,800
找个更合适的人
Choose someone else!

1109
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:22,260
求你了
Please!

1110
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:42,260
不
No.

1111
01:18:58,730 --> 01:19:01,210
你已经离家很远了
You're a long ways past the reef.

1112
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,200
奶奶？
Grandma?

1113
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:08,000
还好我选了黄貂鱼纹身
Guess I chose the right tattoo.

1114
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:10,100
奶奶
Grandma!

1115
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:16,850
我尽力了 奶奶
I tried, grandma.

1116
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:18,650
可
I...

1117
01:19:19,550 --> 01:19:21,550
我做不到
I couldn't do it.

1118
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,380
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

1119
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:27,720
我不该让你一个人承担这么多
I never should've put so much on your shoulders.

1120
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:31,160
如果你想要回家
If you are ready to go home.

1121
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:34,030
我可以陪你回去
I will be with you.

1122
01:19:51,290 --> 01:19:52,630
你在犹豫什么
Why do you hesitate?

1123
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,200
我不知道
I don't know.

1124
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,800
有个女孩多么出众
I know a girl from an island.

1125
01:20:02,830 --> 01:20:05,320
她来自那个海岛
She stands apart from the crowd.

1126
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:08,540
她爱海洋也爱家园
She loves the sea and her people.

1127
01:20:09,230 --> 01:20:11,780
大家都为她骄傲
She makes her whole family proud.

1128
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:15,740
也许世界和你作对
Sometimes the world seems against you.

1129
01:20:16,230 --> 01:20:18,850
旅途上跌倒受伤
The journey may leave a scar.

1130
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:21,340
但伤疤却见证了
But scars can heal and reveal

1131
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:24,210
你的成长
Just where you are.

1132
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:28,370
你爱的人能改变你
The people you love will change you.

1133
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:31,600
你学的知识指引你
The things you have learned will guide you.

1134
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:34,960
没有什么能阻止你
And nothing on earth can silence.

1135
01:20:35,570 --> 01:20:38,510
你心中的那个声音
The quiet voice still inside you.

1136
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:41,880
当这声音轻轻地问
And when that voice starts to whisper

1137
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:44,890
莫阿娜 你已成长了这么多
Moana you've come so far.

1138
01:20:45,950 --> 01:20:47,380
莫阿娜 现在
Moana listen.

1139
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:52,820
你是谁你知道吗？
Do you know who you are?

1140
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:55,780
我是谁？
Who am I?

1141
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:01,510
我就是我 热爱着小岛
I am a girl who loves my island.

1142
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,710
这海洋给我生命
I'm the girl who loves the sea.

1143
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:08,690
与使命
It calls me...

1144
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:13,880
伟大的酋长是我的父亲
I am the daughter of the village chief.

1145
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:17,750
我们的祖先越洋万里
We are descended from voyagers.

1146
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:20,470
找到这里 然后给我
Who found their way across the world.

1147
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:23,280
这启示
They call me ...

1148
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:26,900
带领大家找到这地方
I've delivered us to where we are.

1149
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:30,010
我的旅途漫长
I have journeyed farther.

1150
01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:36,550
我没有保留付出所有 但在心里
I am everything I've learned and more. Still it calls me.

1151
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:39,650
我听到有个声音悄悄在
And the call isn't out there at all.

1152
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:42,670
呼唤我
It's inside me.

1153
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:49,560
像潮水涨退循环的交替
It's like the tide always falling and rising.

1154
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,370
我回把你收藏在心底
I will carry you here in my heart.

1155
01:21:52,460 --> 01:21:55,510
给我提醒
You remind me.

1156
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:58,730
路有多难
That come what may.

1157
01:21:58,870 --> 01:22:01,900
勇敢面对
I know the way!

1158
01:22:02,090 --> 01:22:06,470
我是莫阿娜
I AM MOANA!

1159
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:43,450
我是莫图鲁尼岛的莫阿娜
I am Moana of Motunui.

1160
01:22:44,870 --> 01:22:48,250
快上船 我要带你跨越整片大海
Aboard my boat, I will sail across the sea.

1161
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:51,310
归还特菲提之心
And restore the heart of Te Fiti.

1162
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:29,890
恶卡不可能下到水里
Te Ka can't follow us into the water.

1163
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:32,680
我们可以穿过障壁岛
We'll make it pass the barrier islands.

1164
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,880
然后抵达特菲提
We'll make it to Te Fiti.

1165
01:23:34,970 --> 01:23:36,770
可惜你什么都听不懂
None of which you understand.

1166
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:38,370
因为你只是一只鸡
Because you are a chicken.

1167
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:45,800
不
No!

1168
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:47,700
憨憨
Hei-hei!

1169
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:49,290
不
No, no, no, no, no!

1170
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:51,770
干得漂亮
Nice work!

1171
01:25:01,850 --> 01:25:02,690
特菲提
Te Fiti!

1172
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:28,900
毛伊
Maui!

1173
01:25:33,610 --> 01:25:34,680
你回来了
You came back.

1174
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:39,640
但你的鱼钩
But your hook.

1175
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:41,680
再被击中一次就
One more hit, and ...

1176
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:44,040
恶卡得先抓到我才行
Te Ka's gotta catch me first.

1177
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:48,500
我来掩护你 小英雄
I got your back, chosen one.

1178
01:25:49,630 --> 01:25:50,640
去拯救世界吧
Go, save the world.

1179
01:25:51,050 --> 01:25:51,560
毛伊
Maui.

1180
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:53,330
谢谢你
Thank you.

1181
01:25:54,510 --> 01:25:55,360
不用谢
You're welcome.

1182
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:30,370
嘿 恶卡
Hey... Te Ka!

1183
01:26:31,790 --> 01:26:32,820
鲨鱼头
Shark head.

1184
01:26:45,620 --> 01:26:46,550
莫阿娜
Moana!

1185
01:26:56,650 --> 01:26:58,460
把那颗心放进漩涡里
Get the heart to the spiral!

1186
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:37,790
特菲提
Te Fiti.

1187
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:39,990
特菲提消失了
It's gone.

1188
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,090
恶卡
TE KA!!

1189
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:32,010
让她过来吧
Let her come to me.

1190
01:28:55,390 --> 01:28:59,540
走过千山与万水追寻你
I have crossed the horizon to find you.

1191
01:29:05,950 --> 01:29:08,580
我了解你
I know your name.

1192
01:29:12,410 --> 01:29:17,110
他们偷走你心底的自己
They have stolen the heart from inside you.

1193
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:23,840
却不能够定义你
But this does not define you.

1194
01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:31,200
这不是真的你
This is not who you are.

1195
01:29:33,230 --> 01:29:38,810
你是谁 你决定
You know who you are...

1196
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,370
谁才是真正的你
Who you trully are.

1197
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:12,310
特菲提
Te Fiti.

1198
01:30:52,710 --> 01:30:53,780
小笨鸡还活着呢
The chicken lives.

1199
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:57,750
很抱歉毁了你的鱼钩
I'm sorry about your hook.

1200
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:03,110
其实 不管有没有鱼钩 我都是毛伊
Well, hook, no hook, I'm Maui.

1201
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,030
特菲提
Te Fiti!

1202
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:27,720
你最近好吗？
How you've been?

1203
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:33,550
好吧 都是我的错
Look, what I did was wrong.

1204
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:36,090
我真的很抱歉
I have no excuse.

1205
01:31:37,390 --> 01:31:38,390
对不起
I'm sorry.

1206
01:31:47,430 --> 01:31:50,290
要知道拒绝女神给的礼物可不礼貌
You know, it'd be rude to refuse a gift from a Goddess.

1207
01:31:55,990 --> 01:31:56,790
谢谢
Thank you.

1208
01:31:56,870 --> 01:31:59,390
你的宽宏大量让我不胜感激
Your kind gesture is deeply appreciated.

1209
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:50,600
我会想你的 小笨鸡
Gonna miss you, drumstick.

1210
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:52,300
你可以跟我们一起走
You could come with us, you know.

1211
01:32:52,890 --> 01:32:56,320
我的族人们需要寻路高手的指点
My people are going to need a master wayfinder.

1212
01:32:58,170 --> 01:32:59,290
他们已经有一位了
They already have one.

1213
01:33:18,310 --> 01:33:19,610
那就再见了 毛伊
See you out there, Maui.

1214
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:22,440
那就再见吧 莫阿娜
See you out there, Moana...

1215
01:34:16,070 --> 01:34:17,250
妈妈 爸爸
Mom! Dad!

1216
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:18,580
莫阿娜
Moana!

1217
01:34:26,950 --> 01:34:31,220
我可能离家稍微远了点
I may have gone a little ways past the reef.

1218
01:34:32,850 --> 01:34:34,040
这才是你
It suits you.

1219
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,330
- 她回来了  - 莫阿娜
- She's back!  - Moana!

1220
01:34:36,930 --> 01:34:37,930
胖胖
Pua!

1221
01:34:40,590 --> 01:34:41,590
莫阿娜
Moana!

1222
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:36,420
定好了目的地
We set a course to find...

1223
01:35:36,730 --> 01:35:41,310
每一次出行找寻新天地
A brand new island everywhere we roam.

1224
01:35:43,390 --> 01:35:45,930
家乡的模样放心里
We keep our island in our mind.

1225
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:51,100
时间到了就回家 千山万水
And when it's time to find home, We know the way

1226
01:35:51,130 --> 01:35:55,660
我们去探索每一个符号
Aue, Aue. We are explorers reading every sign.

1227
01:35:55,710 --> 01:36:00,600
这里有我们的祖先 古老的故事与传承
We tell the stories of our elders in a never ending chain.

1228
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:13,070
千山万水
We know the way....

1229
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:18,770
海洋奇缘
