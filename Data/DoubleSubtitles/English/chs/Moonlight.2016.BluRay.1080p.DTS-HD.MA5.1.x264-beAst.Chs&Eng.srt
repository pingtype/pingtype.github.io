黑人无处不在
There are black people everywhere.

189

记住这一点 好吗
You remember that, okay?

190

这个世界上
No place you can go in the world

191
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,310
到处都有黑人的踪影

192
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,240
我们是这个星球上最早诞生的人类

但你在这里不知道这些
but you wouldn't know it from being here, though.

197
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,990
我当时也是个虎头虎脑的小个子 伙计
I was a wild li'l shorty, man.

198
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,530

199
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:04,060
在月光下光着脚奔跑
Runnin' around with no shoes on when the moon was out.

204
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,610
老奶奶截下我

208
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,560
在月光下
In moonlight...

209

215
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,620
有些时候你得自己决定你要做什么
At some point you gotta decide for yourself who you gonna be.

216
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,690
没人能替你做决定
Can't let nobody make that decision for you.

217
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,540
你喜欢游泳吗 伙计

It's what I paid for. It ain't what I bought.

你要告诉他吗
You gon' tell him?

285
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,290
你个垃圾
You ain't shit.

286
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,540
走 我们走
Come on! Let's go!

287
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,650
你们瞅啥
The fuck y'all lookin' at?

288
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,430
特瑞莎
Teresa.

289
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,900
你的小男朋友来了
Your boyfriend's here.

290
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,270
孩子
Boy.

291
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,970
今天要跟我说话吗
You talking to me today?

292
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,280
好吧
Okay.

293
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,710
没关系
That's alright.

294
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,410
反正我也不想跟你说话
I don't wanna talk to you, anyway.

295
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,690
你知道她喜欢你 是吧
You know she got a crush on you, right?

296
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,690
你还好吗
You all right?

297
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,470
你一路走过来的吗
You walk all the way here?

298
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,270
好吧
All right.

299
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,310
首先 重中之重 你不能坐在这个位置
First things first. You can't sit at my table like that.

300
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:01,310
你不能背对着门坐 起来
You can't sit with your back to the door, come on.

301
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,620
如果有人悄悄靠近你 你会浑然不知
Ain't gonna know if somebody creepin' up on you.

302
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,290
好了 看到了吗
All right, see that?

303
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:11,190
现在一切尽收眼底
Now you can see everything.

304
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,040
想什么呢
What's over there?

305
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,420
我昨晚看见你妈妈了
I saw your mama last night.

306
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,220
我讨厌她
I hate her.

307
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,360
嗯
Hmm.

308
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,400
嗯 我猜你也是
Yeah, I bet you do.

309
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,430
我也不喜欢我妈妈
I hated my mom, too.

310
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,870
尽管我现在很想她
I miss her like hell now though.

311
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,580
这就是对这件事我要说的
That's all I'm gon' say about that.

312
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,420
谢谢
Thank you.

313
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,700
什么是基佬
What's a faggot?

314
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,080
基佬是
A faggot is...

315
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:49,290
是一个侮辱同性恋的词
...A word used to make gay people feel bad.

316
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,860
- 我是基佬吗  - 不
- Am I a faggot?  - No.

317
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,200
不是
No.

318
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:05,100
你可以是同性恋 但你不能让别人叫你基佬
You can be gay, but you gotta let nobody call you no faggot.

319
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,670
我是说 除非
I mean, unless...

320
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,180
我怎么知道我是不是
How do I know?

321
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:22,350
你会知道的
You just do.

322
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,960
我觉得
I think.

323
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,130
到时候你就知道了
You'll know when you know.

324
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,000
嘿
Hey...

325
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:38,470
你现在还不会知道 好吗
You ain't gotta know right now, all right?

326
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,010
现在还不会
Not yet.

327
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,890
你贩毒吗
Do you sell drugs?

328
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,370
嗯
Yeah.

329
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,570
那我妈妈
And my mama...

330
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,340
她是不是吸毒
...she do drugs, right?

331
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,980
嗯
Yeah.

332
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:14,000
好 脱氧核糖核酸
Okay, deoxyribonucleic acid.

333
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,130
很长的一个词 对不对
Long word, right?

334
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,700
好 它本质上就是基因
All right, it's basically genes.

335
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,470
我知道你们还不知道这是什么意思
I know y'all don't know what that means

336
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,710
但是请先认真听
but just hang with me for a second.

337
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:24,010
本质上这个长
So it's basically this long...

338
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,550
奇伦 你需要什么吗

339
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,050
他忘了换卫生棉
Hey yo, that nigga forgot to change his tampon.

340
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:31,820
抱歉 皮尔斯老师
I'm sorry, Mr. Pierce.

341
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,550
他今天有女性生理问题
He just having woman problems today.

342
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,820
- 对不对 小不点  - 好了 特雷尔 够了
- Ain't that right, little?  - All right, Terrell, that's enough.

343
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,660
不 小不点可觉得不够
Nah, can't be enough for little..

344
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,060
你要多少 小不点
How much you need, little?

345
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,060
- 不要那样叫我  - 好了 特雷尔 到此为止
- Don't call me that!  - All right Terrell, that's it.

346
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:45,560
你想干嘛 奇伦 看我削你
Hey, what you gonna do, chiron? I'll fuck you up.

347
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,570
特雷尔 出去
Hey yo, Terrell, out!

348
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,940
拜托 你怎么了
Come on, man. What's wrong with you?

349
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,610
我们讲到哪了
Where were we?

350
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:05,320
脱氧核糖核酸本质上是一个很长的模型
DNA is basically this long model...

351
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,130
等我收拾你 小不点
Im'ma be waitin' for your ass, little.

352
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:37,020
别害怕 奇伦

353
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,860
奇伦 怎么了 兄弟

356
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,800

357
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,170
你在这干嘛

358
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,530
留校 兄弟
Detention, man.

359
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,740
埃姆斯逮到我在楼梯间打炮
Aimes caught me with this trick in the stairway.

360
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,600
- 真倒霉  - 是啊

361
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,110
跟谁
With who?

362
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,840
你还真是个八婆 兄弟
Damn, you nosey, nigga.

363
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,110
- 我的错  - 不是 我开玩笑的
- My bad...  - no, I'm playing, yo.

364
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,980
听着 我只是想快点做完 你知道吗
Look, I wanted some quick head you know,

365
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,450
但是那个小妞老是说“用力 凯文”
but this chick all like "Hit that shit, Kevin.

366
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,050
“用你的大鸡巴操我”
Hit it with that big dick."

367
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:13,290
这么夸我有意思么
Why she got to compliment a nigga for?

368
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,320
所以我就说“好吧 我们来吧” 你知道吗
So I'm like "A'ight. Shit. We can do this", you know?

369
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,960
然后我就开始大力干她
So I started banging her back out, dawg.

370
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,760
我是说大力干她
I'm talking I'm banging her back out.

371
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,860
但是她大吼大叫
She went and made all this fucking noise though.

372
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,860
然后埃姆斯就进来了 弄得跟警察一样
So aimes come in, acted all five-o and shit,

373
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,800
差点让我停学 哥们

374
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:27,800
虽然我供认不讳
I talked it out, though.

375
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,970
但是我告诉他我们是青梅竹马 类似的话
I told him we was like childhood sweethearts and all of that,

376
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,240
所以我只被留校 还不错
so I just got detention, it's cool.

377
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:36,140
- 不错  - 这件事只有我们两个人知道 对吧

00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,710
我知道你会守口如瓶的 兄弟
I know you can keep a secret, dawg.

380
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,210
真心话 好了 我要走了
Real talk though, I gotta go, a'ight,

381
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,020

384
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:04,390

00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,070
- 嘿 妈妈  - 你今晚不能待在这儿
- Hey, mama.  - Uh-uh. You cannot be here tonight.

386
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:38,370
我有客人要来
I got company coming.

387
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,310
找个能收留你的地方吧

拜托
Boy please.

392
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,870
我知道胡安以前经常给你酒喝
I know Juan used to give you that gin.

393
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:09,170
但是现在他不在了 小不点
But we ain't doing that up in here, shorty.

394
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,770
你不觉得我的笑话很好笑吗
You don't think my joke was funny?

395
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,850
怎么了
What's wrong?

396
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,520
没事
Nothing.

397
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,480
我没事

398
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,090
才怪

00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,660
孩子 别这样

412
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,730

如果你还想待在这儿
Now, if you gon' stay here, though,

416
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:21,540
你就得学会如何
you gonna have to learn how to make a bed

417
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,170
铺好床 孩子

418
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:26,410
- 什么  - 什么
- What?  - What you mean, "What"?

419
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:28,680
把那个给我 不是你这样铺床的
Give me that. That ain't how you make up no bed.

420
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,590
你肯定觉得自己很狡猾
You think you slick, too.

421
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,020
自己做错了
You know, do it all wrong

422
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,460
这样特瑞莎就可以来帮你弄好
so Teresa can come over here and do it right.

423
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,460
我知道你打什么鬼主意
I know what you doing.

424
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,730
你和胡安
Oof, you and Juan.

425
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:46,230
你们两个真不愧是好兄弟
Y'all two, thick as thieves.

426
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,430
那个给我
Give me that.

427
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,920
好了
All right.

428
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,820
还需要我做什么吗 亲爱的
Do you need anything else from me, sweetheart?

429
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,990
呃 没了 我很好
Uh, no, I'm good.

430
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,420
好吧
Okay.

431
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,390
好吧 我明天早上叫醒你
All right, I'm gonna wake you up in the morning.

432
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,950
你好吗 小黑
You good, black?

433
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,070
奇伦
Chiron!

434
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,210
- 嘿 宝贝  - 嘿 妈妈
- Hey! Hey, baby!  - Hey, mama.

435
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:41,750
你昨晚去哪儿了
Where'd you go last night?

436
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,050
什么
What?

437
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,450
怎么了
Why?

438
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,490
我是不是你妈妈
I'm yo' mama, ain't I?

439
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,320
为什么你不回家 孩子
Why you ain't just come home later, boy?

440
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,230
你让我一直担心你
You had me worried about you.

441
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,930
我猜你长大了
I guess you getting grown.

442
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,070
我不能一直把你留在我身边
I can't be keeping up with you all the time.

443
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:07,910
宝贝 特瑞莎怎么样
Anyway baby, how Teresa doing?

444
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:10,410
自从葬礼之后 我就没见过她
I ain't seen her since the funeral.

445
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,250
妈妈把自己锁在门外了
Listen, mama locked herself out the door, yeah?

446
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:16,180
你来开下门吧
Can you come let her in?

447
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,750
快点 宝贝

448
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:24,920
让我进去吧 宝贝
Let me in, baby.

449
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:27,830
宝贝 求你了
Baby, come on.

450
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,530
我以为你说过
I thought you said...

451
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,370
妈妈 我以为
mama, I thought you...

452
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,900
等一下 妈妈 妈妈
wait, mama... mama!

453
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,390
我需要钱
I need some money.

454
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:02,290
用来干什么
For what?

455
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,760
这是我的事
That's my business.

456
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,260
你没资格过问
Don't you ask me no shit like that.

457
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:10,230
- 我没有钱  - 不不 不要骗我 孩子
- I don't have no money...  - no, no. Don't lie to me, boy.

458
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,740
我是你妈妈
I'm your mama.

459
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,710
那个特瑞莎跟你一点关系都没有
That bitch over there ain't no kin of you.

460
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,240
我才是你的亲人 知道吗
I'm your blood, remember?

461
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,410
我现在感觉很不好
Now I ain't feeling good.

462
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:21,010
我需要解脱
I need something to help me out.

463
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,250
求你了 宝贝
Come on, baby.

464
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,480
求你了 宝贝
Come on, baby.

465
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:29,150
我去哪儿找钱啊
Where I'm supposed to get money from?

466
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,120
什么
What?

467
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:34,890
特瑞莎难道没给你点钱吗
Teresa ain't give you nothing, huh?

468
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:39,230
她怎么可能没给你揣点钱
Your li'l play-play mama ain't put something in your hand?

469
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:41,400
把钱给我
Give me that damn money, chiron.

470
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,270
把钱给我 把钱给我
Give me the damn money! Give me the damn money!

471
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:46,440
我真的没钱
I don't have no money!

472
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,000
- 妈妈 求你了  - 把钱给我
- Mama, come on...  - give me the damn money!

473
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:49,710
- 妈妈 求你了  - 把钱给我
- Mama, come on...  - give me the damn money!

474
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,610
好了 好了
All right! All right!

475
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:53,040
把钱给我
Give me the damn money.

476
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:57,950
给你
Here, man.

477
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:00,950
这就对了
Yes. That is what I thought.

478
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,760
我对她还真是了解
I know that bitch like a hooker know her trick.

479
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,360
你是我的孩子 好吗
You my child, okay?

480
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,460
告诉她最好不要忘了
And tell that bitch she better not forget it.

481
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,230
接着去上学
Go on to school.

482
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,460
你没迟到吗
Ain't you late?

483
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,080
所以现在你可以知道白血球减少
So you can see how a lack of white blood cells

484
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,880
对人体很危险 对不对
can be dangerous to the human body, right?

485
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:35,820
好 有人能解释一下 如果没有足够的白血球
Okay, can anybody explain what will happen to the body

486
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:38,020
人体会有什么反应吗
if there's not enough white blood cells?

487
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,230
如果没人回答问题
Ain't nobody's leaving this classroom

488
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:42,890
就不下课
until I get a response.

489
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,430
相信我 这个问题你知道比我知道要更重要
This is more important for you than it is for me, trust me.

490
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,570
嘿 小不点
Hey yo, little!

00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:00,140
- 我要回家  - 什么

493
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,880
我跟你说了 我要回家
Man, I told you. I'm going home!

494
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,420
你觉得我们傻吗 你住在那边
You think we stupid? You live over there, nigga.

00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:06,380
哦 不对 他要去特瑞莎家
Oh no, he going to Teresa house.

496
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,290
特瑞莎 那不是胡安的女朋友吗
Teresa? That's Juan lady, ain't it?

497
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:10,690
是哦 她长得可真是漂亮呢
Oh yeah. She fine as hell.

498
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:12,790
- 胡安才刚死没多久  - 就是啊
- Juan been dead a minute, though.  - You right.

499
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:14,290
天哪 她免费口交吗
Hell, she give free head?

500
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,090
还是她像宝拉那样收费
Or does she charge like Paula?

501
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,660
宝拉现在便宜了
Hell, Paula getting cheap though.

502
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:20,230
口气硬口活也硬
Talkin' like a rock can get your rock sucked!

503
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:21,470

我不搞同性恋
Now I ain't with that gay shit,

506
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,210
但是如果你敢惹我

507
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:28,670
我能让你的菊花欲罢不能
I'll give your ass more than you can handle.

508
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,540
让你哭着找你的瘾君子老母
Have you runnin' to your crackhead-ass mama.

515
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:48,390

Damn, I didn't know you smoked like that.

544
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:43,630
我妈妈在家里什么都抽
My mom leaves all types of shit around.

545
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:04,620
微风让我感觉很舒服 哥们

有时候在我们住的街道附近
Sometimes round the way, where we live...

548
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:14,590
你都能感觉到同样的风
...you can catch that same breeze.

549
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:18,960
穿过住宅区 好像所有的事
It just come through the hood and it's like everything stop

550

551
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,970
因为所有人都想感受一下
...'cause everyone just wanna feel it.

552
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:26,340
一切都变得安静 你知道吗
Everything just gets quiet, you know?

553
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:32,180
你唯一能听见的就是自己的心跳
And it's like all you can hear is your own heartbeat.

554
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,610
是吗
Right?

555

00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:02,970
你为什么哭
What you cry about?

563
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:08,510
有时候我会哭个不停
Shit, I cry so much sometimes

564
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:11,320
感觉自己都快变成水做的了
I feel like I'm gon' just turn into drops.

565
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:18,390
感觉自己可以一头扎进水里 是吗
Think you can roll out into the water, right?

Roll out into the water like all these other motherfuckers

567
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,400

752
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:02,170

这里有个点唱机
We got this jukebox in here and, uh...

758
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:15,880
有人点歌 它就会播放
...and folks come by and play they songs,

759
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,910

你都没尝试过跟谁说说
You ever thought about talking about it with somebody?

775
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:01,180
甚至不需要是一个心理顾问
Maybe not even a counsellor.

776
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:03,550
也许可以跟你妈妈说说
Maybe somebody like your mama?

777
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:08,990

789
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:47,590
能帮帮别人也是好事
...might as well help other folks.

790
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:50,530
让我不惹麻烦
Keep myself out of trouble.

791

797
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:17,190

805
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:44,310
我是个废物

但是你不爱我也没关系
But you ain't gotta love me.

813
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:21,480
上帝知道我没有在你需要的时候给你我的爱
Lord knows I did not have love for you when you needed it,

814
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,320

所以你不爱我没关系
So you ain't gotta love me...

Damn, bother, I thought you said you didn't drink...

869
01:28:42,010 --> 01:28:44,350
尝不出酒的味道 不敢多喝
Can't really taste it so I don't mess with it.

870
01:28:56,790 --> 01:28:58,730

我们很早就有了他
We had him young, too young.

890
01:30:25,780 --> 01:30:29,020
老兄 进监狱之后生活太艰难
Man, when I got locked up, man, that shit was hard.

891
01:30:29,020 --> 01:30:30,720
我再也回不去原来的街区了
Wasn't no way I could go back the streets, man.

892
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:32,350
回不去了

We gotta be, you know, 'cause of li'l man, but...

897
01:30:44,370 --> 01:30:46,770
只不过不是从前那样了

01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:07,660
说吧
Man, come on now.

904
01:31:07,660 --> 01:31:09,060
我在厨房忙前忙后
I've been back there in that kitchen, man,

905
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:11,360
给你做菜

906
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,600
吃人家的嘴软
these grandma rules, man.

907
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,000
拿人家的手短
You know the deal.

908
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,730
吃饱喝足了 该说说了
Your ass eat, your ass speak.

909
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:26,440
好吧 那我就直说了
All right, straight up?

910
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:28,080
说吧 直接说
Yeah, nigga, straight up.

911
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:32,450
我在贩毒
I'm trappin'.

912
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:37,590
什么
What?

913
01:31:38,450 --> 01:31:39,650
嗯
Yeah.

914
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,460
因为打了那个男孩
When they sent me to Atlanta,

915
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:45,530
他们送我到亚特兰大的少管所
put me straight into juvie for beatin' the old boy.

916
01:31:45,530 --> 01:31:47,400
在那里我遇到一个人
Met this dude in there.

917
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:51,030
我出来以后 他让我上街卖毒品
When I come out, he put me on the block.

918
01:31:51,030 --> 01:31:53,200
后来我混得风生水起
Did good at it and rose up.

919
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:56,710
就是这样
It is what it is.

920
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:00,980
胡说
Bullshit, man.

921
01:32:02,110 --> 01:32:03,910
不应如此
That ain't what it is.

922
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:06,950
那不是你 奇伦
That ain't you, chiron.

923
01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:10,820
你又不了解我
Nigga, you don't know me.

924
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:16,860
我不了解你吗
I don't know you?

925
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,340
这是您的小票
There you are.

926
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:40,680
二十四点五美元
$24.50.

927
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:09,010
你为什么要戴金牙
Why you got them damn fronts, man?

928
01:33:58,660 --> 01:34:00,400
为什么给我打电话
Why'd you call me?

929
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:02,730
什么
What?

930
01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:06,870
我问你为什么打电话给我
Why did you call me?

931
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:13,010
我告诉过你的
I told you, man...

932
01:34:13,010 --> 01:34:15,880
- 有个男人走进来  - 说重点
- ...dude came in...  - Yeah, yeah, yeah...

933
01:34:23,650 --> 01:34:25,790
他放了首歌
He played this song, man...

934
01:36:39,820 --> 01:36:41,220
这是你的车吗
This you?

935
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:47,700
你说贩毒还真不是开玩笑说说的啊
You wasn't playin' 'bout them traps, huh.

936
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:06,110
开始飙车了吗
Ride dirty, huh?

937
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:08,720
差不多吧
Something like that.

938
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:17,090
你怎么上下班
So how you be in to work?

939
01:37:18,290 --> 01:37:19,530
坐公交
Bus.

940
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:21,230
黑车
Jitney.

941
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:23,570
有时当我带着小凯文的时候
Sometimes Samantha shoot me out there

942
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:25,530
萨曼塔会来接我
when I got li'l kev.

943
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:31,310
在迈阿密没车的日子简直无法想象
I can't picture bein' in Miami with no car.

944
01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:34,680
- 这倒是真的  - 我想也是
- Man, it's real out here.  - Yeah, I bet.

945
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:39,880
这里天气又热 车又慢 还特别堵
Real hot, real slow, and real busted.

946
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:42,350
感觉自己像个窝囊废
Shot me like a duck out here, man.

947
01:37:42,350 --> 01:37:45,020
你说什么
This nigga said "A duck."

01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:48,120
- 你喝高了吧  - 你知道我在做什么
- Yeah, you on one.  - You know what I'm doin'.

949

- 没事  - 很感激你
- Yeah.  - Appreciate it.

952
01:37:56,270 --> 01:37:58,170
不用客气
Yeah, man.

953
01:37:58,170 --> 01:38:00,000
总不能让你坐黑车吧
Can't have yo ass on no jitney.

954
01:38:06,710 --> 01:38:08,410

958
01:38:25,060 --> 01:38:28,860
还是说你嗑嗨了
Like you was just- you was just on one...

959
01:38:28,870 --> 01:38:30,570
就开上高速路吗
...and you hit the highway?

960
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:36,600
是的
Yeah.

你还真是不胜酒力
Man, you a lightweight.

969
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:45,370
是你倒的酒

01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:23,830
上一次我见到你的时候吗
You remember the last time I saw you?

991
01:42:30,270 --> 01:42:32,670
太久了 我尽量不去想
For a long time, tried not to remember.

992
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,380
试着忘掉过去的种种
Tried to forget all those times.

993
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:42,850
好吧
Yeah.

994
01:42:44,420 --> 01:42:46,420
我来到亚特兰大
When we got to Atlanta...

995
01:42:47,390 --> 01:42:49,490
开始了新的生活
...I started over.

996
01:42:49,490 --> 01:42:52,030
白手起家
Built myself from the ground up.

997
01:42:52,030 --> 01:42:53,690
变得强大起来
Built myself hard.

998
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:02,900
- 你怎么样  - 我吗
- What about you? You...  - me?

999
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:09,810
我根本不值一提
I wasn't never really worth shit.

1000
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:13,750
只是浑浑噩噩地活着
Just kept on, man.

1001
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:19,490
从未实现过心中所想
Never really did anything I actually wanted to do.

1002
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:22,440
我能做的
It was all I could do was

1003
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:24,990
就是活成别人所想的样子
to do what folks thought I should be doing.

1004
01:43:24,990 --> 01:43:26,890
我从来没真正做自己
I wasn't never really myself.

1005
01:43:29,830 --> 01:43:31,270
现在呢
And now?

1006
01:43:31,270 --> 01:43:32,730
现在
Now?

1007
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:37,810
如今
Now, man...

1008
01:43:37,810 --> 01:43:40,240
我有了小凯文
...now I got li'l kev.

1009
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:42,040
做着这份工作
Got this job.

1010
01:43:42,740 --> 01:43:44,950
十八个月的实习期
Another 18 months of probation.

1011
01:43:46,010 --> 01:43:47,920
真实无比
That 's some real shit, man.

1012
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:50,590
这就是我的人生
Nah, man. It's a life.

1013
01:43:51,250 --> 01:43:52,650
你知道吗
You know?

1014
01:43:53,390 --> 01:43:55,920
我从来没经历过这样的生活
I ain't never had that before.

1015
01:43:55,930 --> 01:43:57,460
现在的我
Like...

1016
01:43:58,430 --> 01:44:00,260
疲于奔命
Like, I'm tired as hell right now, man,

1017
01:44:00,260 --> 01:44:03,260
挣着这点小钱
and I ain't making more than shoe money, but...

1018
01:44:04,670 --> 01:44:07,130
但是我已经不再烦恼了
...I ain't got no worries, man.

1019
01:44:07,140 --> 01:44:09,470
我是说以前的种种烦恼
Not them kind what I had before.

1020
01:44:10,570 --> 01:44:12,340
这是真实的生活
That's that real shit.

1021
01:44:13,740 --> 01:44:15,940
就像鲍勃・马利说过的那样
That's that Bob Marley shit, nigga.

1022
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:36,200
这一生只有你抚摸过我
You the only man that's ever touched me.

1023
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:46,840
只有你一个
You're the only one.

1024
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,750
从那以后我也没再碰过别人
I haven't really touched anyone, since.

1025
01:46:29,060 --> 01:46:34,120
月光男孩
