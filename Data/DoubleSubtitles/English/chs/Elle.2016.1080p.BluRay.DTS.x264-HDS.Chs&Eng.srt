感谢原字幕制作者

2
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,420
再来两份油甘鱼的
And some hamachi. Two pieces.

3
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,130
什么是假日卷
What is a "holiday roll"?

4
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,750
好的
Okay.

5
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,590
谢谢
Thank you.

6
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,630
我迟到了 抱歉
I'm late, I know. Sorry.

7
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,340
他们让我工作了一个小时
They kept me at work an extra hour.

8
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,590
你还好吗
Are you okay?

9
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,670
还好
Okay.

10
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,300
脸怎么了
What's that?

11
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,840
我从自行车上摔下来了
I fell off my bike.

12
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,840
- 就这辆车  - 对
- That thing?  - Yeah.

13
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,210
感觉你从来不骑
Looks like you never rode it.

14
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,420
现在知道原因了吧
And you see why?

15
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,840
你总是不说到底在做什么工作
You've carefully avoided saying what this job is.

16
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,880
和你说过了 我才刚刚入行
I told you, it's entry level.

17
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,000
不过升职很快
But there's a fast track to promotion.

18
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,130
类似于经理一类的
Kind of manager.

19
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,800
类似于麦当劳吗
Kind of McDonald's?

20
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,130
对
Yeah.

21
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,920
我给你带了个礼物
I brought you a present.

22
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,550
其实是乔西给你的礼物
It's from Josie, really.

23
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,670
是她的主意
It was her idea.

24
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,550
你照得还挺帅
You look very handsome.

25
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,590
等孩子出生了 我们再拍一张
We'll go back and take another photo after the birth.

26
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,340
相当于出生前后的对比照
Like a before and after.

27
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,960
乔西有很多装修房子的主意
Josie's full of ideas for decorating.

28
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,250
可她现在才第一次有自己的房子
She never had her own place till now.

29
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,210
你们买房还需要多少钱
How much do you need for the apartment?

30
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,630
我没有借钱的意思
I didn't ask for money.

31
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,710
没事 是我想帮帮你们
No, it was me, hearing voices.

32
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,380
我想请你帮我做担保 不是要借钱
I planned to ask you to provide collateral, not money.

33
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,210
乔西的那些男朋友们
And Josie's boyfriends?

34
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,050
他们有人会搬进去吗
Any of them moving in, too?

35
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,670
没有啊 怎么了
No, why...

36
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,460
该死 刚刚换的衣服
Shit! It was just cleaned.

37
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,380
那女孩什么也干不了
That girl is clearly dysfunctional.

38
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,960
你一点也不了解她
You know nothing about her.

39
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,420
我知道她周围那群人连澡都不洗
Except she was raised in a commune by unwashed idiots.

40
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,800
他们是搞艺术的
An arts collective.

41
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,380
她看上你什么了
Why you? What's she after?

42
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,000
她能看上我什么 我又没钱
What could she be after? I have no money.

43
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,000
我有
I have.

44
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,670
你今天是怎么回事
What's with you today?

45
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,920
我给你三个月房租 但我要先看看房子
I'll give you 3 months' rent. But I look at the place first.

46
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,920
我不想给你压力
I didn't want to pressure you.

47
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,250
你赢了 见好就收吧
You won. Quit while you're ahead.

48
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,340
- 再见  - 再见
- Bye.  - Bye.

49
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,590
把楼上楼下的锁都换了
Change all the locks, upstairs and down.

50
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,170
好的
Okay.

51
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,920
我把钥匙放在信箱里了
I left the key in the mailbox.

52
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,670
多谢了
Thanks a lot.

53
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,840
你看过文森特的房子了吗
You've seen Vincent's apartment?

54
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,670
半年以前他卖大麻还和人打架
6 months ago, he was dealing weed and getting into fights.

55
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,170
你还觉得他是居家好男人
You see him as a family man?

56
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,960
乔西那个臭女人就是个祸害
That bitch Josie is a real menace.

57
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,800
他还看不出来
He just doesn't see it.

58
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,050
关 我们觉得
Kwan, we agreed

59
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,750
这个性高潮的动作太拘谨了
the orgasmic convulsions are way too timid.

60
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,630
好像他们害怕做爱一样
As if they're scared of sex.

61
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,300
动作已经加速了五倍
I upped it 5 times.

62
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,960
看不出来再加速
You can't tell. Push it.

63
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,840
我们能抓重点谈吗
Can we discuss the real issues?

64
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,750
我们只有一次机会打动美国动视
We get one shot at Activision,

65
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,880
但我们的手柄太垃圾
but our controller is so crappy

66
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,840
这个演示片段几乎不能玩
the demo is almost unplayable.

67
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,090
如果玩游戏的人冲屏幕扔手柄的话
What's the point coming up with hyper realistic environments for Stix

68
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,960
给斯迪克斯弄仿真环境还有什么意义
if the player throws the controller through the screen!

69
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,420
库尔特 你跑题了 说故障问题
Kurt, you're off track, focusing on known glitches.

70
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,170
不
No.

71
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,880
真正的问题就在这儿
The real problem is right there.

72
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,750
真正的问题是 你之前做文学出版
The real problem is, your background in publishing and literature

73
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,960
根本没有能力评估游戏的可玩性
is completely inappropriate for evaluating playability.

74
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:46,340
好吧 也许安娜和我该开另一种公司
Okay, maybe Anna and I should've founded a different sort of company.

75
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,130
可能克隆纳斯的成功
Maybe Kronos was only a hit

76
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,250
全靠的是你的天才想法
thanks to your genius ideas.

77
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:55,210
可能我们两个就是走了狗屎运
Maybe we're just two bitches who got lucky.

78
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,380
但你要搞清楚
But the fact is,

79
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,000
我才是老板
the boss here is me.

80
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,630
我们已经晚了半年
And we're 6 months behind.

81
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,630
我们的目标很简单 你们都知道
Our goal is simple, as you all know.

82
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,300
玩家手刃妖怪之后
When the player guts an orc,

83
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,880
他得能真正感觉手上有血
he needs to feel the blood on his hands.

84
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,670
粘稠的 热乎的血
Thick, warm blood.

85
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,170
如果可能的话
If at all possible.

86
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,460
我们走
Let's go.

87
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,750
我爱你
I love you.

88
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,840
库尔特恨我 是吗 我多想了吗
Does Kurt hate me or is it just me?

89
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,920
没有 他的确恨你
No, he hates you.

90
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,340
他们都恨你 除了凯文
They all hate you, except Kevin.

91
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,420
即使他用笑来掩饰 他还是很爱你
He really loves you. even if he tries to laugh it off.

92
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,460
你知道的吧
And you knew it, right?

93
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,210
按着这里
Press here.

94
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,380
她知道我想做全面的性病检查吗
She knows I want a full STD panel?

95
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,630
她当然知道
Yes, of course.

96
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,960
如果你担心最近出了问题
If you're worried about a recent exposure,

97
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,670
我可以给你开点阻断药物
I can prescribe a PEP.

98
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,000
不 我在网上看了  副作用太多
No, I looked online. Too many side effects.

99
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,670
我还有工作
I can't miss any work.

100
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,460
听天由命吧
I guess we roll the dice.

101
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:31,960
喂
Hello?

102
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,380
我晚上刚刚有空
My evening just cleared up.

103
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,590
- 我不行  - 别让我失望
- l can't.  - Make an effort.

104
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,050
我不行 我得
I can't. I have...

105
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,880
我来月经了 感觉不舒服
I have my period. I'm not well.

106
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,170
我带上套子
I'll wear a condom.

107
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,050
感谢你的牺牲精神
I appreciate your sense of sacrifice.

108
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,340
一点血阻挡不了我
A little blood doesn't turn me off.

109
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,630
我不行
No, I can't.

110
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,880
再见
See you.

111
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,340
人渣
Scum!

112
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,000
你和你爸爸
You and your father.

113
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,670
我喜欢你对我做的一切
I love everything you do to me.

114
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,130
我们再来吧
Let's do it again.

115
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,750
下次记得按门铃
Next time, ring the bell.

116
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,550
如果你不想看到不该看的
If you want to avoid being treated to upsetting sights,

117
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,840
那就不会让你看到可怕的东西
Then you won't be treated to gruesome sights.

118
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,050
我还是穿上裤子吧
I'd better put some pants on.

119
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,920
你给了他们多少钱
How much do you pay them?

120
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,420
- 好可悲  - 别可怜我
- It's pitiful!  - Save your pity.

121
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,920
我一点也不觉得丢人
I'm not ashamed.

122
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,050
这是我的生活 我的性生活
It's my life. My sex life.

123
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,670
你真是个小混球 米歇尔
You're a little bitch, Michèle.

124
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,460
我只是说 你有未婚夫 小心点
I'm just saying, with your finances. be careful.

125
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,250
你吃了吗 我做了意面
Did you eat? I made spaghetti.

126
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,710
给我来杯咖啡
I'll take a coffee.

127
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,880
- 不脱了大衣吗  - 我冷
- Not taking your coat off?  - I'm cold.

128
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,960
你们还要继续工作吗
You had more work done?

129
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,750
你能别管了吗
Will you stop going on about that?

130
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,590
抱歉了
I'm sorry.

131
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,750
只是肉毒杆菌而已
Just a little Botox.

132
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,380
是你的事
It's your business.

133
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,590
很好
Very good.

134
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,960
你看上去好吃惊
You seem surprised.

135
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,460
这样好点吧
Better like this?

136
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,800
米歇尔 下一次吧 我得走了
Michèle, some other time, I have to take off.

137
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,380
不 先别走
No. not yet.

138
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,300
我妈和你说了她有艾滋病吗
My mother told you she's HIV-positive?

139
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,880
我警告过拉尔夫你会那么说
I warned Ralf you'd try that one.

140
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,670
见到你很高兴
Nice meeting you.

141
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,130
有个事情 你想好了再回答
One question. Think before you answer.

142
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,590
如果我再婚 你怎么看
What would you say if I remarried?

143
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,300
很简单 我会杀了你

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,080
- 给我的  - 对 我自己做的
- For me?  - Yes, made it myself.

286

好贴心啊
That's so sweet.

287
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,950
- 好吃  - 还不错吧 对吗
- Delicious.  - Not bad, right?

288
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,000
勒布朗女士 您好
Mrs. Leblanc? Hello.

289
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,540

我是菲利普 中介的人
I'm Philippe, from the agency.

291
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,160
文森特 来得正好 我需要你
Vincent, good timing, I need you here.

292
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,580
你好 米歇尔

294
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,500

295
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,370
你的胳膊
With your arms...

296
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:36,620
书架一米五宽 我想想象一下
The bookcase is 5 feet wide. I want to visualize it.

297
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,160
像这样可以吗
Like this, okay?

298
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,250
文森特
Vincent...

299
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:42,750
不要比划 就当你是书架
Don't act the bookcase. Be the bookcase.

300
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,200
好的 拿着
Okay, hold this.

301
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,700
文森特真是个好演员
Vincent is quite the actor.

302
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,660
你受伤了吗
Are you hurt?

303
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,160
- 没事  - 没事的
- No.  - No, it's fine.

304
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,660
十二岁的时候他是克隆纳斯的阿基里斯
Age 12, he was young Achilles in Kronos.

305
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,540
一个我出品的视频游戏
A video game I produced.

306
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,910
真的吗
Yeah?

307
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,620
我猜你是最可爱的销甲骑士
I bet you were the cutest knight in armor.

308
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,250
还不错
Not too shabby.

309
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,290
挺好的吧
Nice, huh?

310
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,750
有点太好了 你们觉得呢
A little too nice, don't you think?

311
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,790
这里还有约一米三的空间
There's room for a 50-inch here.

312
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,200
你问她了吗
Did you ask her?

313
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,660
你说过一个微波炉
You mentioned a microwave,

314
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:29,750
但我们觉得电视可能是更好的暖房礼物
but we thought a TV makes a better housewarming present.

315
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,660
比起电视 你们不是更需要烤箱吗
Don't you need an oven more than a TV?

316
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,700
我们不需要 厨房里挺齐全的
We don't need one. The kitchen comes fully equipped.

317
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,700
这是你和我说过的公寓吗
ls this the apartment you told me about?

318
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:41,450
不是 这是两居室
No, it's a 2-bedroom here.

319
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,830
一个月两百五十美元租金
$250 a month more.

320
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,370
另一个太烂了 都没地方放婴儿床
The other one was a dump. Nowhere to put a crib.

321
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,750
太糟糕了
Totally insane.

322
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,410
太烂了 我不觉得
Dump, I don't think so.

323
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,450
可能只是简单了点
Basic, maybe.

324
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,120
但肯定不是烂
Dump, definitely not.

325
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,750
好吧 简单
Basic, sure.

326
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,620
你知道要孩子就是受罪了吗
You realize having a child is all about suffering?

327
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,250
文森特出生的时候就是场灾难
Vincent's birth was sheer hell.

328
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,660
折磨
Torture.

329
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,250
三个小时的折磨
Three hours of agony.

330
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,290
如果你不想帮我们 就别帮
If you don't want to help us, don't.

331
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:14,750
没人强迫你
Nobody's forcing you.

332
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,910
没我 你们怎么办
How'll you get by if I don't?

333
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,750
那是我们的事
That's our problem.

334
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,750
你不能拿了我的钱 还那样和我说话
You can't talk to me like that and take my money.

335
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,040
我才不在乎你的钱
I don't give a shit about your money.

336
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,620
我从没要过
I never asked for it.

337
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,450
你就只知道傻站着 什么也不说
You just stand there, saying nothing, as usual!

338
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:35,540
真是的 你什么时候才能像个男人
It's bullshit! When are you going to get off your ass?

339
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,540
别管闲事
Butt out, you!

340
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,950
你知道这不可能吧
You realize that this is impossible?

341
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,450
- 什么  - 她是个疯子
- What?  - She's a lunatic.

342
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,750
她不是 她是我女朋友
She's not. she's my girlfriend.

343
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,250
你就是看不到我的改变
You refuse to see I've changed.

344
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,250
现在感觉怎么样
What do you feel now?

345
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,000
恐惧还是生气
Fear or anger?

346
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,500
生气
Anger.

347
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,000
你错过你老婆了 安娜今天去昂古莱姆了
You've missed your wife. Anna's in Angoulême today.

348
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,080
你已经知道了
And you knew it.

349
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,540
你知道我有过创伤经历
You know I went through a traumatic experience

350
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,040
就在最近
recently.

351
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,620
你让人觉得你很坚强 什么都没发生
You gave the impression of soldiering on like nothing happened.

352
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,500
我很抱歉 如果我看上去有点麻木
If I seem insensitive, I'm sorry.

353
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,160
那就是我 不是吗
That's just me, right?

354
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:36,120
我看你是沉浸在角色中而已
I see you're staying in character.

355
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:40,040
我角色的一大部分
A big part of my character

356
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:54,660
就是不可琢磨
is being unpredictable.

357
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,450
稍等
Hold on.

358
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,450
你最近发生什么事了吗
Say, have you experienced any incidents recently?

359
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,290
什么事
Incidents?

360
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,000
你知道我在说什么
You know what I mean.

361
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,450
一个男的从车里向我扔比萨 没扔到
A man threw pizza at me from his car. He missed.

362
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,750
人们在市场盯着我看
People were staring at me at the market.

363
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,500
但我总有那种感觉
But I always feel that.

364
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,290
我想是不是不会重新开始了
I wonder if it isn't starting again.

365
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,200
新的循环
A new cycle.

366
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,750
你不知道吗
You don't know?

367
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,950
你父亲那集《被告起立》上周六又播了
The Accused Will Rise about your father aired again last Saturday.

368
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,750
- 人们又重温了一下  - 我不知道啊
- Refreshes people's memories.  - I'd no idea.

369
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,290
你呢
And you?

370
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,620
发生什么事了吗
Anything happened?

371
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,200
没 没什么
No, nothing special.

372
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,040
是因为他的假释听证会
It's because of his parole hearing.

373
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,750
那可是大热的新闻材料
A media feeding frenzy.

374
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,790
下周他就要上庭了
He's up before the judge next week.

375
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,580
你不会错过的
You don't miss a beat.

376
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,620

和我一起来
Come with me.

378
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,250
他们永远不会放他出来 谢天谢地
They'll never let him out. Thank god!

379
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,950
假释听证会就是猜字谜游戏
The parole hearing is a charade.

380
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,700
明知我宁愿把眼睛挖出来
Like you telling me to come,

381
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,120
你却还叫我和你一起去
when you know I'd rather gouge my eyes out.

382
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,950
你准备要恨多久
How long will you hang on to hatred?

383
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,370
我这辈子 下辈子都不准备见他了
I'll never see him again, in this world or any other.

384
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,200
- 好吧 没下辈子了  - 您的咖啡

- 剩余时间不多了  - 谢谢
- There isn't much time left.  - Thanks.

386
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,410
他病了
He's ill.

387
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,830
看
Look...

388
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,660
就看一眼
Look, just for one moment.

389
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,540
你害怕看你自己的亲生父亲吗
You're afraid to look at your own father?

390
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,370
收好吧
Put it away now.

391
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,370
你不是那些暴徒
You're not like the mob.

392
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,790
他们只知道他是恶魔
People who only know the monster.

393
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,750
你认识这个人 他只是个人
You know the man. He's just a man.

394
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,750
只是碰巧做了坏事
Who happens to be a monster.

395
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,790
你看到这矛盾了吗
You see a contradiction there?

396
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,580
喝了吧 我已经喝完了
Drink up. I'm done here.

397
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,080
小心点
Be careful, won't you?

398
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:41,080
有些人不只从他们车里
Some people won't just toss crap

399
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,580
往外扔垃圾
from their cars.

400
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,370
马蒂
Marty!

401
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,040
给我那只鸟
Give me that bird.

402
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,080
马蒂
Marty!

403
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,950
我们不治野生的鸟 是麻雀吗
We don't treat wild birds. It's a sparrow?

404
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,450
是的
Yes.

405
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:06,290
我甚至不知道怎么给它插管子
I wouldn't even know how to intubate your sparrow.

406
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,950
如果那是只麻雀的话
If it is a sparrow.

407
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,790
多谢了
Thanks very much.

408
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,910

409

没事的 再见
You're welcome. Goodbye.

410
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,830

今天的南斯郊区 安静的街道
Seen today, this quiet street in the suburbs of Nantes

412
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:41,080
已看不出这里曾发生过何等暴行
bears no trace of the atrocities that took place here

413
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,580
三十九年前

414
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,160
今天的住户没有几个人知道
Few of today's inhabitants

415
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,790
乔治·勒布朗 这个名字

416
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,830
或者很少有人知道
Or if they do,

417
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:52,200
那是一个和恐怖故事有关的名字
it's a name associated with a horror story

418
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:54,040
他们很少有人记得
that they can hardly remember.

419
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,200
那是别的时代的城市传说
An urban folktale from another time.

420
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,910
然而 一九七六年时

法国人的眼睛都盯着这条街

422
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,580
整个国家都屏住了呼吸
A nation held its breath.

423
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,200
震惊
In shock.

424
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,200
时间让人遗忘了曾经那
Time has dulled the terror

425
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,370
五月一天里的恐惧
of that distant day in May.

426
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,750
但对有些人来说 那恐惧不会减少
But for some the horror will never fade away.

427
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,410
那些未解之谜也不会褪色
Nor will the unanswered questions.

428
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,500
什么让乔治·勒布朗
What drove Georges Leblanc,

429
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,080
一个虔诚的天主教徒
a practising Catholic,

430
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,910
慈爱的丈夫 父亲
loving husband and father,

431
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,080
犯下如此重罪
to commit such monstrous and senseless acts?

432
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:32,250
他女儿米歇尔到底扮演了什么角色
And what role exactly was played by his daughter, Michèle?

433
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:35,080
她当时只有十岁
A ten-year-old child at the time.

434
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:41,540
在数年审讯和精神评估之后
After years of trials and psychiatric evaluations,

435
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,620
乔治·勒布朗已经在监狱度过了三十年
over 30 years after Georges Leblanc's incarceration,

436
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,580
终身监禁
sentenced to life,

437
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,620
问题仍然没有得到解答
the questions remain,

438
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,290
虽然过去很久 但仍然令人毛骨护谏然
as banal yet chilling as ever.

439
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,000
首先也是最重要的
First and foremost...

440
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:54,370
为什么
Why?

441
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,950
杀人犯
Murderer!

442
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,750
希望那个是可回收的
I hope that's recyclable.

443
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:15,910
那是只死鸟
It's a dead bird.

444
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,200
理查德
Richard!

445
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,500
你是怎么想的
What were you thinking?

446
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,410
我很担心你
I was worried about you.

447
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,620
上帝
Jesus!

448
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,620
别揉你的眼睛
Don't rub your eyes.

449
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,500
你说你被强奸了 但也不报警
You say you were raped and didn't report it,

450
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,950
显然我得
obviously I'm going to...

451
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:10,200
天啊 你真把我弄伤了
Holy shit, you really did a number on me!

452
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:11,870
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

453
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,830
那有用吗 你知道你在做什么吗
That helps? You know what you're doing?

454
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:17,040
那在防狼喷雾的商标上
It's on the pepper spray label.

455
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,500
可能 我会瞎的
Could be, I'll go blind.

456
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,370
当然不会瞎
Of course, you won't go blind!

457
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,540
好了
There we go.

458
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,870
- 来杯红酒  - 好
- Glass of wine?  - Yes. please.

459
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,790
我没认出那辆车 那是谁的
I didn't recognize the car. Whose is it?

460
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,250
朋友的
A friend's.

461
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,790
女朋友的吗
A girl friend's?

462
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:37,040
- 她的名字叫海琳  - 海琳
- Her name's Hélène.  - Hélène.

463
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,790
我借她的 我的车在店里
I borrowed hers. Mine's in the shop.

464
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,700
有人把保险杠撞坏了
Somebody smashed the bumper.

465
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,370
几乎看不出来
It was barely visible.

466
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,910
她只是个朋友 米歇尔
She's a friend, Michèle.

467
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,700
我为什么要澄清这个呢
Why am I even justifying this?

468
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,410
你没有必要澄清什么
You have nothing to justify.

469
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,290
- 她是学生吗  - 研究生
- She's a student?  - Grad student.

470
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,250
挺让人惊讶
Surprise me.

471
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:05,910
她不是我的学生 她组织博瓦尔研讨会
She's not my student. She organizes a De Beauvoir seminar.

472
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,450
她邀请我去发言
She invited me to speak.

473
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,870
她读过你的书
And she's read your book.

474
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,040
她读过
She's read it.

475
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,500
她告诉我她被深深地打动了
And told me how deeply it touched her,

476
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,450
我心都快化了
I melted inside.

477
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,040
就是这些 其余的事你可以想象
That's all. You can imagine the rest.

478
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,250
其实我倒是真能想象到
I can imagine just fine, actually.

479
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,660
你真的没有必要嫉妒
Your jealousy is insane.

480
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,700
没有 我只是关心而已
No, I'm just concerned.

481
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,790
我关心因为这是我害怕的
I'm concerned because this is what I feared.

482
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,000
大胸又不检点的女人 我倒不担心
The bimbos with big tits never worried me,

483
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,790
但是读《第二性》的女人会把你吃了
but a woman who's read The Second Sex will chew you up

484
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,660
然后再把你吐出来
and spit you out.

485
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,120
真正的危险是你 米歇尔
The real danger, Michèle, is you.

486
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,160
你认识她吗
Did you know about her?

487
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,870
认识 我见过她一次
Yeah, I met her once.

488
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,450
什么时候的事
When was that?

489
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,950
上周 我们在爸爸那儿一起吃饭
Last week. We all had dinner at Dad's.

490
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,120
怎么没听你提起过
Why didn't you mention it?

491
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,500
我不知道
I dunno...

492
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,040
乔西 把那个放下 我来弄
Josie, put that down. I'll do it.

493
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,620
什么时候
When?

494
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,120
和我说话能别分神吗
Can I have some focus here, please?

495
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:03,040
怎么了
What?

496
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,910
海琳是什么样的人
What's Hélène like?

497
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,660
她挺酷的 瑜伽教师 好像教高温瑜咖
She's cool. A yoga teacher. Bikram yoga, I think.

498
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,160
把你的脚挪开可以吗
Move your feet, will you?

499
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,410
在哪儿教
Where?

500
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,120
- 怎么了  - 我告诉埃里克他可以留着
- Why?  - l told Eric he could have it.

501
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,830
埃里克 谁是埃里克
Eric? Who's this Eric?

502

503
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,910

504

你帮我拆包行吗
How about you help me unpack?

505
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,450
我马上来
I'll be right there.

506
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,580
十分钟后比赛结束
The fight'll be over in 10 minutes.

507
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,500
接下来是足球比赛
And soccer next up.

508
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,530
乔西 你要去哪儿
Josie! Where are you going?

509
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,610
文森特 我再打给你
Vincent, I'll call you back.

510
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,030
好的 再见
Yeah. bye.

511
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,700
看到了吗
Seen it?

512
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,990
整个办公室都看到了
It was sent to the whole office?

513

看看
Take a look.

514
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,320
这不是他第一次发给我东西
This isn't the first thing he's sent me.

515
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,650
谁给你发的东西
First thing who's sent you?

516
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,450
那个袭击你的人
The guy who attacked you?

517
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,900
是的
Of course.

518
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,780
你觉得可能吗 强奸你的人
You think that's possible? Your attacker?

519
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:26,200
邮件看上去是从这里发出的
I mean, the email seems to come from here.

520
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,530
看着像
Looks like it.

521
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,320
赶紧给警察打电话
Call the police now.

522
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,110
警察 绝不 没有用的
The police, never again. It's pointless.

523
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,400
这次不一样 你是受害者
This is different. You're the victim.

524
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,360
那时候我也是受害者
I was the victim then!

525
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,400
对不起 我
Sorry, I...

526
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,200
我不想警察卷进来
I don't want the police involved.

527
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,820
我不会让这个白痴把那些破事搅起来
I won't let this cretin stir up all that shit.

528
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:46,860
我努力重建生活 不让警察 记者
I fought too hard to rebuild my life, so police, journalists...

529
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:48,780
没门
No way.

530
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,240
上帝保佑
God help us.

531
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,820
有个疯子在周围
There's a nutjob out there.

532
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,490
疯子 我可以搞定 那是我的专长
Nutjobs, I can handle. My specialty.

533
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,320
我们服务器六月就被攻击过
When our server was hacked in June,

534
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,070
有人把克苏鲁板从主机上拆下来
somebody ripped the Cthulhu template off our mainframe.

535
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:07,650
类似于这样的图像就从那时候开始出现
Images like these have floated around since then.

536
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,450
我的秘密崇拜者
My secret admirer

537
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,530
肯定是个高科技能人
must be highly tech savvy.

538
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,650
- 之前的雇员吗  - 有可能
- A former employee maybe?  - Yeah.

539
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:23,780
最后一个问题 你觉得她美吗
Last question. You think she's pretty?

540
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,150
弯腰 从背部很低的位置开始
Bend forward, from low in your back.

541

朝着地板 伸展你的脊椎

左手推地板 逐渐坐起来

00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,280
海琳
Hélène?

548
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:50,570
我是米歇尔 理查德的前任

我想来当面道歉
I wanted to apologize face to face.

552
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,200

For what?

00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,490
你的车窗 抱歉
Your car window. I'm sorry.

554
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:08,030

Please. it's nothing. Anyway, Richard explained it all.

555
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,030
是吗 他怎么说的
Really? What was his explanation?

556
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,240
他说是个事故
It was an accident.

557
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,990

562
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:29,070
我们避免了尴尬
We've dodged an awkward situation.

563
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,110
为什么说是尴尬呢
Why would it be awkward?

564
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,400

567
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,570
- 我的意思是  - 都已经过去了
- l mean...  - But it's behind us now.

568
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,610
没错
Exactly!

569
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,530
我们以后应该三个人一起聚聚
We should get together some time, all of us.

570
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,030
对 我要开一个圣诞聚会
Yes. I'm having a Christmas party.

571
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,400
你一定要来
You really must come.

572
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,110
一起来吧
Come along.

573
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:56,820
恭敬不如从命
If I must.

574
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:00,240
具体的我会告诉理查德 我该走了
I'll give Richard the details. I should get going.

575
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,200

578
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,570
喂
Hello?

579
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,360
皇家港 现在吗
Port Royal, right now?

580
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,240
真的吗
Really?

581
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,110
她一直在出血 他们做了超音波
She was losing blood. They did an ultrasound.

582
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,650
- 她有  - 胎盘早剥
- She has a...  - A placental abruption.

583
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,150
他们说没问题 正在引产
They say it's okay but they're inducing labor.

584
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,990
- 噢  - 奥马尔 我的一个哥们
- Oh  - Omar, a buddy of mine.

585
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,280
- 你好  - 爸爸

586
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,030
- 现在怎么样了  - 还不知道
- What's the news?  - Nothing yet.

587
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,450
- 嗨  - 嗨

588
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:48,860
我在这儿
I'm right here.

589
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:51,860
- 我害怕  - 没事的
- I'm scared.  - It's gonna be okay.

590
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,070
好痛啊
It hurts!

591
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,650
我去拿一杯咖啡
I'll go get a coffee.

592
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,150
深呼吸
Deep breaths.

593
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,610
该死 好痛啊
Fuck, it hurts!

594
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,860
怎么突然间你要办圣诞聚会了
So suddenly you're throwing a Christmas party?

595
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:08,700
我觉得是了解彼此的好机会
I thought it'd be good to get to know each other better.

596
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,110
对了 她很可爱
She's lovely, by the way.

597
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,400
又是你的一个圈套吗
Another of your traps?

598
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:15,650
我还有别的事 没空计划恶毒的圣诞聚会
I have better things to do than plot diabolical Christmas dinners.

599
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:19,280
她有忌口的东西吗 对什么过敏
ls there anything she won't eat? Any allergies?

600
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,780
那猫掉毛掉得厉害
The cat's shedding like crazy.

601
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:25,360
你的小提琴家我都从没抱怨过
I made no fuss about your violinist.

602
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:26,780
那不一样
That was different!

603
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:30,110
他已婚 有三个孩子 条件都满足
He was married with 3 kids. He checked every box.

604
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:33,110
她年轻 单身 年龄正适合要孩子
She's a young, single woman of child-bearing age.

605
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,400
你违背了所有的约定
You've broken all the rules.

606
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:37,780
我第一次听说约定 不是我的错
First I heard we had an agreement. It's not my fault if...

607
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:42,030
是你的错 我们应该还在一起的
It is your fault. We should still be together.

608
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,110
- 是你的错  - 是你离开我的
- It's your fault.  - You left me.

609
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,530
你打了我
You hit me.

610
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,450
如果我这辈子有后悔的事 就是那个了
If there's one thing in my life I regret, it's that.

611
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:54,950
生了
All done!

612
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,820
- 生了吗  - 是的
- All done?  - Yes.

613
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,450
我们得去做DNA检测
We're going to need a DNA test.

614
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:31,400
- 要抱孩子进来吗  - 马上
- Are they bringing him in?  - Right now.

615
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,650
我会是个好妈妈的
I'll be a good mother to him.

616
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,700
傻子 你会是最棒的妈妈
Silly! You'll be awesome!

617
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,030
要我们出去吗
Should we go?

618
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:57,610
不用
No.

619
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,150
没事
It's fine.

620
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,030
有很多人
Lots of people here.

621
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,740
大家好
Hey, everybody!

622
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:17,950
骄傲的父亲
Who's a proud Daddy!

623
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,400
真是个小奇迹 他真漂亮
A little marvel! Isn't he handsome!

624
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,450
快看看他
Look at that!

625
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:33,450
这是我生儿子的地方
This is where I had my son.

626
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,490
就在这个妇产中心
In this maternity unit.

627
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:36,900
真有趣
That's funny.

628
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,150
倒不是 令人惊异的是
Not really. The amazing thing is,

629
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,280
我的朋友安娜
my friend Anna...

630
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,360
- 你刚刚见过她了  - 是的
- You saw her up there, you met her.  - Yes.

631
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:46,650
她和我同一个晚上生的孩子
She gave birth here that same night.

632
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:50,030
这是我们见面的地方
This is where we met.

633
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:53,740
她的孩子是死胎 她要帮我的孩子喂奶
Her child was still born. She asked to breastfeed mine.

634
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:55,360
天啊
Oh my!

635
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,700
我和她说 可以
I said to her, fine.

636
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,820
自那以后 我就总想
Since then, I've often wondered.

637
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,650
安娜和我的儿子
They've always been very close.

638
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,740
关系很亲近
Anna and my son.

639
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:10,240
我想会不会有某种铭记
I wonder if there wasn't some kind of

640
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:13,860
就像鸭子一样
imprinting, like with ducks.

641
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:18,360
然而 和我呢
With me. on the other hand...

642
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,990
- 你知道  - 抱歉 他们在呼我
- You know...  - Sorry, they're paging me.

643
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,280
有时候我看到文森特
Sometimes I look at Vincent,

644
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,070
一无所长的粗人
the big lout with nothing special about him

645
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:30,200
他是从我的肚子里出来的
that came out of my belly,

646
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,280
我得承认 我不了解他
and I have to admit I don't know him.

647
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:55,110
- 晚上好 米歇尔  - 晚上好 瑞贝卡
- Evening, Michèle.  - Evening, Rebecca.

648
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,860
帕特里克陪你进去吧 有个小偷
Patrick will walk you inside. There's a prowler.

649
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:00,700
- 是吗  - 帕特里克和他打了一架
- There is?  - Patrick fought with him.

650
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,570
- 小偷  - 是的
- A prowler?  - Yes.

651
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:05,320
他们要派三辆车来对付他
They're sending 3 cars after the creep.

652
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,240
你和他打了一架
You fought with him?

653
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,950
我见他蹲在这儿的灌木丛里
I caught him crouched in the bushes,

654
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:10,780
往你屋子里望
watching your house.

655
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,820
我走近的时候 他开始跑
When I approached, he took off.

656
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,280
你看到他的脸了吗
You saw his face?

657
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:18,240
没有 他戴着面具 像是滑雪面具
No, he was wearing a mask, like a ski mask.

658
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,320
就像电视剧里的跟踪者
Like a stalker on a TV show.

659
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:21,820
他跑了
He got away.

660
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,900
帕特 陪她进去吧
Pat, go in with her.

661
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:25,700
不 不麻烦了
No, don't bother.

662
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:31,360
- 还是去吧  - 好吧 马上回来
- Do it anyway.  - Okay, be right back.

663
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:39,610
真的没有关系 真的
It's really not necessary, honestly.

664
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,280
我屋里有防狼喷雾
I have pepper spray in the house.

665
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:43,740
好
Good to know.

666
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,110
灯的开关在你左边
Light switch on your left there.

667
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,450
看上去一切都好
Everything seems to be okay.

668
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,360
谢谢你 我很感激
Thanks, anyway. I appreciate it.

669
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:22,360
没事的 我又没做什么
No problem, I didn't do much.

670
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,360
我差点抓住他了
I nearly caught him,

671
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:26,030
不过他跑得太快了
but he took off so fast.

672
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:30,490
高中时 我跑一千米才用两分四十二秒
In high school, I ran the 1,000 meters in 2'42''.

673
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:35,990
可能他的速度说明了他有多怕你
Perhaps his speed shows how scared he was of you.

674
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:40,570
谢谢你救了我的自尊
Thank you for salvaging my pride.

675
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,070
不客气
You're welcome.

676
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,400
那
Well...

677
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:01,700
看到或者听到什么 就大声叫
See anything or hear anything, just shout.

678
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:02,860
看到或者听到什么 就大声叫
Okay.

679
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:08,030
我当奶奶了
I'm a grandmother.

680
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,900
- 恭喜你啊  - 谢谢了
- Congratulations.  - Thank you.

681
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:25,400
天啊 我为什么说这个
God knows why I said that.

682
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:53,320
早上好 米歇尔
Morning, Michèle.

683
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:57,610
我很喜欢你的上衣
I like your sweater.

684
00:49:58,950 --> 00:49:59,950
你滑雪吗
Do you ski?

685
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:02,570
当然
Sure.

686
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:04,820
我随时可以带你去
I'll take you anytime.

687
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,360
凯文
Kevin?

688
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,860
你会打枪对吧
You shoot, right?

689
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,740
我是说真正的打枪
I mean. real shooting.

690
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:36,490
是的 没错
That's right, I do.

691
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,990
你有枪吗
You own guns?

692
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,490
有两把
A couple.

693
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,320
你能教教我吗
Could you teach me?

694
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,320
没问题 我可以教你
I could show you, sure.

695
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:56,450
真实生活中 这样就行了
In real life, that'd do the job.

696
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:59,200
真实生活中 他会跑得更快
In real life, he'd run faster.

697
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:00,740
确实
True.

698
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:02,950
试试四四口径的
Try the .44 now.

699
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,820
凯文 我还想和你聊聊
Kevin, I also wanted to talk to you

700
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:16,030
因为我有一份私人的任务给你
because I've got an unofficial assignment for you.

701
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,950
那个黑客
A black op?

702
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,530
我想知道是谁做的那个动画
I want to know who created that animation.

703
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,320
你知道我说的是哪个吧
You know the one I mean?

704
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:30,700
黑进整个办公室里人们的家用电脑
Hack into the home computers of the whole office.

705
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,200
至少要查所有男士的
All the guys, at least.

706
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:38,360
我想帮忙 可那是违规的
I want to help, but that's a major violation.

707
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:41,240
我给你一万现金
I'm offering $10,000 cash in hand.

708
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:44,990
就当是你我之间的秘密
Between you and me. Our secret.

709
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:51,530
你这么查别人 会发现奇怪的事情的
When you snoop on people, you turn up some weird shit.

710
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:54,320
我知道 我不会另眼看他们
I know. I won't judge.

711
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,150
这个放哪儿
Where does this one go?

712
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,110
就放在这里
Put it right there.

713
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,650
我解开那一个 试一下
I untangled that one. Try it.

714
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,900
- 这个吗  - 右边那个 等会我弄另一个
- This one?  - On the right. I'll do the other next.

715
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,400
- 你好 瑞贝卡  - 嗨 米歇尔
- Hi, Rebecca!  - Hi. Michèle.

716
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:07,530
太漂亮了
Beautiful!

717
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:09,610
- 晚上好  - 晚上好
- Evening.  - Evening.

718
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,820
耶稣的诞生每次都会感动到我
The Nativity gets me every time. Where it all began.

719
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:17,070
没错
Very true.

720
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:22,150
我知道现在才邀请你有点不礼貌
I know it's rude to invite you last minute,

721
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,450
不过我明天要办圣诞派对
but I'm having a Christmas get-together tomorrow.

722
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,280
帕特里克 你听到了吗
Patrick, did you hear that?

723
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,320
是的
Yeah.

724
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:31,200
太好了
With pleasure.

725
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,570
是啊 我们非常愿意去
Yes, with pleasure, absolutely.

726
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:35,650
那
Well then...

727
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,240
明天见
See you tomorrow.

728
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,650
- 明天见  - 明天见
- See you then.  - See you then.

729
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,700
谢谢你
Thank you.

730
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:48,900
理论上 我们可以给理查德爱人那份
In theory, we could put a toothpick

731
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:50,740
里面插一根牙签
inside one for Richard's ladylove.

732
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:53,320
或者毒死她
Or just poison her.

733
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,900
她该能预见的 她已经觉得我是毒妇了
She has me pegged as a Medea, She'd see it coming.

734
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:57,360
充满了嫉妒
consumed by jealousy.

735
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,650
她也是古典文学专业的吗
She was a classics major, too?

736
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:06,610
- 乔西  - 罗伯特
- Josie.  - Robert.

737
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:07,990
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas!

738
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:09,400
- 好 爸爸  - 太好了
- Okay, Dad?  - Great.

739
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:10,530
嗨 孩子
Hi, kiddo.

740
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:13,030
天啊 他臭死了 抱着
Jeez, he stinks. Here!

741
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:15,990
你怎么样
How you doing?

742
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:20,450
你要把我们都震聋吗 小心点
You trying to deafen us all with your shit? Careful.

743
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:21,860
大家好
Hello, all!

744
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:24,400
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas!

745
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:31,820
如果我变成那样 就杀了我吧
If I ever show up like that, kill me.

746
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:33,280
晚上好
Evening!

747
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:36,990
- 晚上好  - 晚上好

748
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:39,650
抱歉我们晚了 我在挖一瓶
Sorry we're late. I was digging out a great...

749
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:40,700
失陪
Excuse me.

750
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,400
赤霞珠红葡萄酒
Cabernet.

751
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:46,490
- 晚上好  - 晚上好
- Evening!  - Evening!

752
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,200
拼字游戏啊
Scrabble party!

753
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:51,360
谢谢
Thank you.

754
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:52,450
- 晚上好  - 晚上好
- Evening!  - Evening!

755
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:53,950
最近有状况吗
Any more alerts?

756
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:56,200
没有 那个恶人不理我们了
No, the bogeyman's deserted us.

757
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,240
反正今晚我们是安全的
Anyway, we're safe tonight.

758
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,900
我三月拿到了红带
I got my red belt in March.

759
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:06,150
练空手道之前 我练了很久跄拳道
I did Taekwondo for years before switching to Shotokan.

760
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,740
我从来没练过空手道
I've never done karate.

761
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:09,700
她取笑我呢
She was making fun of me.

762
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,360
好吧
Ok.

763
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:17,820
你总不能一晚上不理我吧
You can't avoid me all night.

764
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:18,900
你想打赌吗
Want a bet?

765
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:27,780
很高兴你们能来
I'm glad you made it.

766
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:29,570
我们不怎么应酬
We don't get out much.

767
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:32,700
不过瑞贝卡很喜欢聚会
Unfortunately for Rebecca, who's a very social person.

768
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,740
和我不一样
Unlike me.

769
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,950
很高兴她今天把你给拽过来了
I'm glad she dragged you over here tonight.

770
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:41,570
那没什么难的
It was no hardship.

771
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,070
晚上好
Good evening!

772
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,360
抱歉我迟到了
So sorry I'm late.

773
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:48,150
工作脱不开身
I couldn't get off work.

774
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,400
我们也才坐下 嗨 海琳
We just sat down. Hi, Hélène.

775

谢谢
Thanks.

782
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:04,900
抱歉了
I'm sorry...

783
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:08,490
我想先祷告 你们介意吗
I'd like to say grace, if nobody objects.

784
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,950
当然不会 请吧
Of course not. Please do.

785
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:13,490
谢谢了
Thank you.

786
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,030
上帝保佑我们 谢谢恩赐的食物

787
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:21,320
给饥饿的人面包

788
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:23,070
阿门
Amen.

00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:25,110
- 阿门  - 阿门
- Amen.  - Amen.

790
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,570
要红酒吗 米歇尔

791
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:28,110
是的 谢谢
With pleasure.

792
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:30,280
帕特里克 你是做什么的
So, Patrick, what do you do?

793
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:31,780
我做银行业的
I work in banking.

794
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,490
我是个经纪人 我有罪
I'm a broker. And I plead guilty.

795
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:37,030
为什么呢
How come?

796
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:41,490
开玩笑呢 现在这工作不太受欢迎
Just joking. It's not a popular profession right now.

797
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:43,030
从来都这样
It never was.

798
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,200
- 或许吧  - 各位
- l guess not.  - Well.

799
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,860
祝圣诞快乐
To Christmas!

800
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,240
敬我们
And to us!

801
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:53,570
尤其是新加入我们的成员
Especially the newcomers to our table...

802
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:54,900
艾琳
lrène,

803
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:57,150
帕特里克
Patrick,

804
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,740
瑞贝卡
Rebecca.

805
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:03,360
拉尔夫

806
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,070
拉尔夫
Ralf.

00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:06,700
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas!

808
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:08,780
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas!

809
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:13,700
米歇尔工作太劳累了
Michèle's worked like a trooper.

810
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:14,740
的确是
Absolutely.

811
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,900
我很爱烹饪
I love cooking.

812
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,320
你什么时候去
When are you going?

813
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,570
我准备订
I'll try to book the...

814
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:26,150
但是我们想选的时间 票很紧俏
But the period we want books up fast.

815
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,860
人们没有意识到艺术是需要培养的
People don't realize the art muscle needs training.

816
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:32,610
否则文化就会坍塌 变得差劲
Or else culture collapses, goes flabby.

817
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:35,490
现在就这样 差劲的文化
That's what we've got now. Flabby culture.

818
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:37,320
是在说我吗
Is that aimed at me?

819
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,950
曾经会追求
Originality or singularity

820
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:42,150
原创性和奇特性
used to be valued and sought after.

821
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:45,490
或者甚至是本身的结局 现在就是责任了
Or even an end in itself. Now it's a liability.

822
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:47,150
理查德是个理论家
Richard's a theorist.

823
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,400
我说的不是创新
I'm not talking about novelty.

824
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:51,860
还创新 都是胡扯的
Coming out of our ass, novelty!

825
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:53,650
晚餐的美好景象
Delightful image at dinner.

826
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:56,740
灵感是什么百分之八十的努力工作
Anyway, what's inspiration? 80% hard work.

827
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:59,700
有的人根本不知道要努力工作
Some people know nothing of hard work.

828
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:00,900
他们文化里就没有这个
It's not in their culture.

829
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:03,070
我们知道你在说谁
We know who you mean.

830
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:05,450
我什么也没说
I didn't say a word.

831
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:07,860
不 我觉得 每个人都不同 我爱每个人
Everybody's different. I love everyone.

832
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:13,400
我们都是上帝的孩子
We're all children of God!

833
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:17,150
对 非洲人吃山羊内脏 他们不同
Yeah, Africans eat goat's innards. They're different.

834
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,150
没错
Exactly.

835
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,570
我去了肯尼亚旅行 非常棒
I went on safari in Kenya. It was great.

836
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:22,150
是的 就是的
Right, there you go.

837
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,740
我觉得现在说很合适
I think now is a good time.

838
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:26,740
我有个事要宣布
I have an announcement to make.

839
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:32,030
拉尔夫和我订婚了
Ralf and I are engaged to be married.

840
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:43,570
对不起
Sorry.

841
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:48,650
你怎么这么奇怪
How do you manage to be so grotesque?

842
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,610
你没意识到吗
Don't you realize?

843
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:55,900
希望大家都喜欢蓝萄
I hope everyone likes blueberries.

844
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,240
乔西比食谱要求的多加了好多蓝薄
Josie added a ton to the official recipe.

845
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:04,450
我想创新一下 所以多加了蓝荀
I was feeling creative, so I added blueberries.

846
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:08,570
看上去不错
Looks good to me.

847
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:15,900
快半夜了 你介意我放弥撒吗
It's almost midnight. Do you mind if I put on the Mass?

848
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:17,240
完全不介意
On the contrary.

849
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:24,950
你们要走了吗
You're leaving?

850
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:27,490
聚会很棒 真的
It was wonderful. Really.

851
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:29,990
下次我们来办 你来参加
Next time, our turn. You'll come to us.

852
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:31,950
咱们别急
Let's not rush things.

853
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:32,990
让我们来
Leave it to us.

854
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:36,990
米歇尔和我先一起吃午饭
We'll have lunch first, Michèle and I.

855
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,240
就我们两个人
Just the two of us.

856
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:40,490
一点点来
One step at a time.

857
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:42,280
我同意 好主意
I agree, excellent idea.

858
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:43,400
晚安
Goodnight.

859
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:44,450
晚安
Great.

860
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,570
- 再见  - 再见
- See you!  - See you!

861
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,280
再见
See you, 'night!

862
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:55,570
和银行小子调情 那是考验吗
Flirting with the banker, was that a test?

863
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:59,070
你在我家还胡闹 都到这个程度了吗
You're making a scene in my home? It's come to that?

864
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:03,950
- 我们再聊  - 做点有用的事
- We'll talk later.  - Make yourself useful.

865
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:18,200
灾难
Disaster!

866
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,780
- 那是两个两字词 －一个两字词
- That's two double words.  - One double word.

867
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:22,450
我比你的大
I can top that.

868
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:24,070
旅途
Journey!

869
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:26,450
- 六十四  - 等等 我来
- 64.  - Hold on, I've got it.

870
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:27,700
不，那是七十
No, that's 70.

871
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:29,400
七十 你看
70, you see.

872
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:30,700
怪我
My bad.

873
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:32,700
- 女士们  - 不用了 谢谢了
- Ladies...  - No, thanks.

874
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:34,400
- 确定吗  - 是的
- Sure?  - Really.

875
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,400
诅咒他吧 见鬼去吧
Curse him! Damn him!

876
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:44,950
合上书 按响铃 吹灭蜡烛
Close the book, ring the bell, blow out the candle.

877
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:47,150
那是什么
What's that?

878
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:48,900
还说自己是天主教徒
Call yourself a Catholic?

879
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:51,240
都不知道逐出教会的仪式
You don't know the excommunication rite?

880
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,280
你知道
And you do?

881
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:56,490
我听说过
I've heard about it.

882
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,900
在我去学校之前 我的父亲
My father made the sign of the cross on me,

883
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:01,610
给我做十字的手势
before I left for school.

884
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:03,900
他给所有本地的孩子都做
He did it to all the local kids

885
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:06,740
直到后来有些家长不愿意了
until some parents asked him to stop.

886
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:08,150
听起来很合理啊
Sounds reasonable.

887
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:11,240
显然 我的父亲被冒犯到了
Apparently, my father was offended.

888
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:13,650
那一晚 他出去走
That night. he made the rounds.

889
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:16,490
挨家挨户敲别人家的门
Knocked on every door,

890
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:19,030
走进街上的每一家
went into every house on the street

891
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,700
带着一把猎枪 一个屠夫棒
with a shotgun, a butcher's mallet

892
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:22,650
还有两把厨刀
and a pair of kitchen knives.

893
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:25,610
对 我听说过
Yes, I heard about that.

894
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:30,820
你只听说二十七个人类受害者 没说动物
You heard about the 27 human victims, not about the animals.

895
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,990
没有提到动物
They never get a mention.

896
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:34,780
还有六只狗
6 dogs,

897
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:37,400
几只猫
a couple of cats, too.

898
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:40,950
不知道为什么 他饶了一只仓鼠
For whatever reason, he spared a hamster.

899
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:43,110
这事你不能瞎编
You couldn't make it up.

900
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:52,030
他回来的时候我在做功课
I was doing my homework when he arrived home

901
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,740
他浑身全是血
with blood all over him.

902
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:56,200
我妈妈当时在工作
My mother was at work.

903
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,570
她那时是个护士
She was a nurse back then.

904
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:01,900
你能想到吗 我妈妈是个护士
Can you imagine my mother. a nurse?

905
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,780
很滑稽吧
Funny, isn't it?

906
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:05,570
我们没必要谈这个
We don't have to go over it.

907
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:08,860
我不介意 说出来让我感觉好一些
I don't mind. It does me good to talk.

908
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:12,990
他决定把屋子里所有的东西都烧了
He decided to burn everything in the house.

909
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:15,490
我帮忙点了火
I helped feed the fire.

910
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:18,200
我们把所有的都烧了 窗帘 地毯
We gutted the place. Curtains, carpets...

911
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,650
桌子 椅子
Tables, chairs...

912
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:20,990
所有都烧了
All in the fire.

913
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:24,820
那很让人兴奋
It was exciting. You get caught up in it.

914
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:29,950
正要烧我们的衣服时 警察来了
We were about to burn our clothes when the police arrived.

915
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,650
有人给我们拍了张照
Someone snapped a photo.

916
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:36,610
奇怪的是 那张照片让人们印象深刻
Bizarrely, it's that photo that stuck in people's minds.

917
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,990
我半裸着 浑身都是灰
Me, half-naked, smeared with ash.

918
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:43,450
一个精神病女孩的样子
The photo of a little girl as psychopath,

919
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:45,400
站在她父亲旁边
next to her father,

920
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:47,030
那个疯子
the psychopath.

921
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:53,200
照片里我空洞的眼神很恐怖
My empty stare in the photo is terrifying.

922
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,820
不赖吧
Not bad, huh?

923
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:04,530
要喝白兰地吗
Cognac?

924
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:07,110
- 好的  - 用同一个杯子行吗
- Love one.  - Same glass okay?

925
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:10,820
还有人要白兰地吗
Cognac anyone?

926
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,530
- 我 谢谢  - 威士忌
- Me, please.  - Whiskey.

927
01:04:12,610 --> 01:04:14,450
- 香槟 谢谢  - 我没有了
- Champagne, please.  - I'm out.

928
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:16,990
一杯威士忌 一杯白兰地
So, one whiskey and one cognac.

929
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:18,530
你知道
Are you aware

930
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:21,200
刚刚你对我态度非常刻薄吗
how mean you were to me at dinner?

931
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,490
是的 我知道
Yes, I am.

932
01:04:22,570 --> 01:04:23,740
你真是残忍
You're cruel

933
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,400
如果有事 有人让你不舒服
when you find anything or anyone unpleasant.

934
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:28,320
显然我就是其中之一
I'm on the list, apparently.

935
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,530
我们两个都不够醉 不该说这个
Neither of us is drunk enough for this conversation.

936
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:32,860
好吗
Okay?

937
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,280
- 艾琳  - 艾琳
- lrène!  - lrène!

938
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:47,490
怎么了
What's happened?

939
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:48,900
能听到我说话吗
Can you hear me?

940
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,650
难以置信
I don't believe it!

941
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:52,360
你最好信
You better believe it!

942
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:12,740
什么
What?

943
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:16,200
去看看
Go see...

944
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:18,070
你爸爸
your father.

945
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:28,450
她中风了
She's had a major stroke.

946
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:33,400
我们减轻了她的脑压 但她还是没反应
We alleviated the pressure on her brain but she remains unresponsive.

947
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:36,240
没有反应 什么意思
Unresponsive. meaning?

948
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:38,530
她陷入昏迷了
She is comatose.

949
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:40,860
昏迷多久
How long for?

950
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:44,110
对不起 我们不能确定
Sorry, there's no telling.

951
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,860
- 她状态比较稳定  - 真的吗
- l mean, she's stable...  - This is real?

952
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:48,990
什么
Excuse me?

953
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,530
我是说
No. I mean...

954
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:55,700
有没有可能她是在装
There's no way she's faking it or playing it up?

955
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:59,070
你们从医学角度确定这是中风吗
You're medically certain this is for real?

956
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:04,740
抱歉 但这是真的中风
I'm sorry, but yes it's for real.

957
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:09,610
其实 很可能你妈妈再也醒不过来了
In fact, there's a strong probability your mother will not wake up.

958
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,950
不过就像我说的 她现在状态很稳定
But as I say, she's stable right now.

959
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,900
我建议你回去休息一下
I suggest you get some rest.

960
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,530
你在这里也帮不上什么忙
There's nothing you can do here now.

961
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:23,110
如果有情况 我们马上通知你
We'll call you if there's any news.

962
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,070
再见 谢谢你
Goodbye and thank you.

963
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:32,530
坚强一点
Be strong.

964
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:45,740
怎么样
Well?

965
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:47,950
情况不好
It's not good.

966
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:50,360
你介意睡在客房吗
Do you mind sleeping in the guest room?

967
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,200
不介意
No.

968
01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:53,990
你和我一起睡
You're sleeping with me.

969
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:02,530
你看到理查德和海琳了吗
Did you see Richard with Hélène?

970
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:03,700
看到了
I did.

971
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:06,400
还是老生常谈
Telling the same old stories.

972
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:08,530
但她还是总能被逗乐
And she seemed amused by them all.

973
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:11,030
你们会成为好朋友的
You'll wind up being good friends.

974
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,110
确实
No doubt.

975
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,030
我会过去吃饭 就我们三个人
I'll go over for dinner, just the three of us.

976
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:19,110
我想象 自己拿着一盒马卡龙站在他们门口
I picture myself at their door with a box of macaroons.

977
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,200
那样让我想吐
It makes me want to puke!

978
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:49,280
你记不记得在卡西斯
You remember in Cassis?

979
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,860
我们试了一下
We tried.

980
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:58,900
那时真是没救了 我们一直笑个不停
It was hopeless. we couldn't stop laughing.

981
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:26,740
你干什么呢
What are you doing?

982
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:29,740
安娜去上班了 我想让你高兴点
Anna's gone to the office. I was trying to cheer you up.

983
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:32,650
奇怪的是 你的愚蠢最先吸引了我
Oddly, your stupidity was what first attracted me.

984
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:35,650
如果我错了 我道歉
Sorry if I misjudged.

985
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:37,570
我不能再那样了 咱们停下
I can't do this anymore. We have to stop.

986
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,530
你哪里都好
You were great and everything.

987
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:41,900
我们还是朋友 但是
We'll stay friends but...

988
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:44,200
你是认真的吗
Are you kidding?

989
01:08:44,530 --> 01:08:47,860
这个荒谬的事让人难以忍受 对吧
This whole ridiculous situation is unbearable, right?

990
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:49,610
你不觉得吗
Don't you think?

991
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:50,740
没有
No.

992
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,650
你的胸部更大了
Your breasts are bigger.

993
01:08:59,950 --> 01:09:01,320
我没感觉到
Not that I'm aware of.

994
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:02,700
我这就在告诉你呢
I'm telling you.

995
01:09:06,990 --> 01:09:09,650
说你不需要我了 说我们结束了
Say you don't want me anymore and we're done.

996
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,650
没那么简单
It's not that simple.

997
01:09:12,990 --> 01:09:14,280
如果你非要我说
But if you like...

998
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,990
我不想要那样了 那些谎言
I don't want this anymore, this situation, the lies.

999
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:20,900
不要躲避我的问题
You dodged my question.

1000
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:23,610
对不起
Sorry.

1001
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:25,450
我不想和你上床了
I don't want to fuck you anymore.

1002
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:27,360
这样可以吗
Was that the question?

1003
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:34,990
我不会去见他
I won't see him.

1004
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,780
我又不迷信
I'm not superstitious.

1005
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:39,570
我才不关心临终请求
I couldn't care less about death-bed requests.

1006
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:43,950
如果你想继续用卑鄙手段控制我的话
If you hope to keep manipulating me with this abject stunt...

1007
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:48,150
自从你开始不要脸面
Ever since you gave up on basic morality,

1008
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:51,110
表现得像个被宠坏的小孩开始
acting out like a spoiled teenager,

1009
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,400
你就从来不关心我想什么
you never gave a shit what I thought.

1010
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:55,150
你让我多受伤
How much it hurt me.

1011
01:09:57,450 --> 01:09:59,610
你的动脉瘤不过是个手段
This aneurysm thing is just treachery.

1012
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:01,700
恶心
Disgusting.

1013
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:06,950
就像这个沙拉 带着破橄榄
Like this salad, with its shitty olives.

1014
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:14,110
你不能一直都生我的气
You can't stay mad at me till the end.

1015
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:31,490
好的 新闻频道没问题
Sure, the news channel works fine.

1016
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:33,320
她心搏过速
She's in v-tach.

1017
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,900
发生什么了
What's going on?

1018
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,990
那响声是什么意思
What's that beep?

1019
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:39,740
女士 请
Ma'am. please.

1020
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:41,280
心搏骤停
Cardiac arrest!

1021
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:47,110
二十毫克硝酸甘油
20 mg of GTN.

1022
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,240
无效 升到四十
No change. Up it to 40!

1023
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,780
还是没有反应
Still no change.

1024
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:53,700
她要不行了
We're losing her.

1025
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:46,200
你干什么 对不起 我情不自禁
What are you doing?

1026
01:13:00,070 --> 01:13:02,780
我想找一个风景好些的地方
I'm looking for a spot with some significance.

1027
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,780
又不是会有地方标记着
It's not like there'll be a sign that says,

1028
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:08,700
此处可丢弃妈妈
"Dispose of mother here."

1029
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:09,570
他的奶嘴呢
His pacifier.

1030
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:13,110
我们在那个洞那儿野餐过一次
We had a picnic there once, that hollow there.

1031
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:16,400
我记得很清楚
I remember only too well.

1032
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:20,280
她的鸡肉沙拉害我放臭屁
Her chicken salad gave me horrific gas.

1033
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:21,490
你忘记了吗
You forgot it?

1034
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,740
你怎么这么白痴
How can you be such an idiot?

1035
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,030
我提醒了你三次
Three times I reminded you.

1036
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,990
在家还有在车上 你很享受吗
At home and in the car. You enjoy this?

1037
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,950
看她怎么和他说话
See how she talks to him?

1038
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,450
不要想游戏机了 傻子
Give up the Xbox, moron!

1039
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:36,400
给我闭嘴
Stop it.

1040
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:38,900
闭嘴 闭什么嘴
Stop it? Stop what?

1041
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:40,780
我让你难堪了吗
I'm embarrassing you?

1042
01:13:41,570 --> 01:13:43,360
都是你自找的 浑蛋
All you deserve, asshole!

1043
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,610
产后忧郁症
Baby blues.

1044
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:55,150
我希望我儿子不要遗传她的脾气
I hope my boy doesn't inherit her temperament.

1045
01:13:55,610 --> 01:13:56,610
文森特
Vincent,

1046
01:13:56,700 --> 01:14:00,200
他很可爱 但他不是你儿子 你知道吧
he's cute but he's not your son. You know that, right?

1047
01:14:00,650 --> 01:14:01,530
找到了
Found it.

1048
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:03,900
乔西
Josie!

1049
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,700
你在听吗
Are you listening?

1050
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:06,820
怎么了
What's up?

1051
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,200
他不是你儿子
He's not your son.

1052
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:10,950
看看他皮肤的颜色
Look at his skin.

1053
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:14,280
比你和乔西的肤色深两个色号
It's two tones darker than yours or Josie's.

1054
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:16,820
你看不出来吗
Don't you see?

1055
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:20,450
- 他不是我儿子是谁儿子  - 是别人的
- Whose is he, if he's not mine?  - He's his father's!

1056
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:22,320
他的父亲不是你
His father's not you.

1057
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:24,610
对不起 但是你被耍了
Sorry, but you're being made a fool of.

1058
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:28,740
别碰我
Don't lay a finger on me.

1059
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:32,070
贱人
Cunt!

1060
01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:33,490
什么 你再说一遍
What? Say that again.

1061
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:34,280
贱人
Cunt!

1062
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,200
- 什么  - 贱人
- What?  - Cunt!

1063
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:38,820
文森特
Vincent

1064
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:43,530
站住
Stop!

1065
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:45,360
我知道你很生气
I know why you're angry.

1066
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:47,030
让我静一静
Leave me alone.

1067
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:50,450
接下来怎么办
So what now?

1068
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,950
好 这样应该可以了
Okay, this'll have to do.

1069
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,150
风把它吹起来了
The wind's picking up.

1070
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:28,320
抱歉打扰了 我看你的百叶窗还开着
Sorry to bother you. I saw your shutters open.

1071
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:29,860
进来吧
Come in.

1072
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:33,240
抱歉 我打扰你了吗
Sorry if I'm disturbing you...

1073
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:34,530
没有 没事的
You're not.

1074
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:37,150
暴风雨来时 你的百叶窗不关的话
With your shutters open and a storm brewing,

1075
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:39,110
窗户会碎掉的
your windows'll shatter.

1076
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,610
那可真不是时候
That would be bad timing.

1077
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:42,700
这风可能会造成严重的伤害
The wind can do serious damage.

1078
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:43,780
我知道
I know.

1079
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:46,360
九九年你不在这儿 世界末日啊
You weren't here in '99. The end of the world.

1080
01:15:46,450 --> 01:15:49,070
我相信 你需要帮忙吗
I believe it. You need a hand?

1081
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:51,280
可能需要 谢谢
Perhaps, yes. Thanks.

1082
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:54,150
我没数过 但是这房子应该
I never counted. but there must be

1083
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,610
有二十扇左右窗户
something like 20 windows in this house.

1084
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:59,030
是西风 我们从这里开始就行了
It's a westerly, so let's start there.

1085
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:00,360
在厨房
In the kitchen.

1086
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:30,740
你冷吗
You're cold?

1087
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,450
有一点
A little.

1088
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,950
去关下一扇窗吧
Next window perhaps?

1089
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:41,990
好
Okay.

1090
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,950
我没有想到会有人来
I wasn't expecting anyone.

1091
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:58,570
看上去像野猫战机
Looks like a Grumman Wildcat.

1092
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:00,320
我不知道
I don't know.

1093
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,990
我想自己整修一架
I'd love to restore one.

1094
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,950
然后飞到纽约
And fly it to New York.

1095
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:08,320
你是飞行员吗
You're a pilot?

1096
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,280
不是
No.

1097
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:12,240
人总要有梦想啊
You've got to have a dream.

1098
01:17:19,650 --> 01:17:21,150
我们先关那扇吧
Let's start with that one.

1099
01:18:03,530 --> 01:18:04,490
抱歉
Sorry.

1100
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:28,070
这个召集的画面得之后再出现
The Summoning scene needs to come later.

1101
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:30,990
- 不 这是  - 库尔特 我们没时间争论
- No. this is...  - Kurt, we have no time to argue.

1102
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,990
游戏玩家遇到基拉时
The player encounters Kira

1103
01:18:33,070 --> 01:18:34,740
她是甜美的学校老师
in her sweet, schoolteacher persona

1104
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:36,820
还没有重生为邪恶
before her Dark Rebirth.

1105
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,900
- 不然就没时间犯错  - 对
- Or there's no boner moment!  - Right.

1106
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:43,200
- 米歇尔  - 什么事
- Michèle.  - Yes?

1107
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:44,490
你有时间吗
Got a minute?

1108
01:18:45,570 --> 01:18:46,610
有
Yeah.

1109
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:51,240
我在库尔特私人服务器找到一些东西
I found something on Kurt's private server.

1110
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:54,490
他似乎喜欢碾压
It looks like he's into crushing.

1111
01:18:56,490 --> 01:18:57,780
什么是碾压
What's "crushing''?

1112
01:18:57,950 --> 01:19:00,240
就是字面意思 碾压
What it sounds like. Crush-sh.

1113
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:02,110
好好享受
Enjoy.

1114
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:10,900
变态 但还不是确切的证据
Twisted, but hardly a smoking gun.

1115
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:12,860
我也这么觉得
I guess not.

1116
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:22,900
很好 继续加油
Good work. Keep on it.

1117
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:02,150
尘土女孩
Ash girl.

1118
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:24,490
尘土女孩
Deliciously nasty.

1119
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:26,990
下流美味
Deliciously nasty.

1120
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,450
你在这儿
You're here?

1121
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:45,200
你疯了吗
You're mad?

1122
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:46,820
我只是好奇
I'm mostly curious.

1123
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:49,610
我想我该解释一下
I guess I should explain.

1124
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:56,570
我本来不会给别人看的
I was never going to show it to anyone.

1125
01:20:57,610 --> 01:20:59,400
菲利普·关把它从我的电脑上弄下来
Philippe Kwan ripped it off my computer

1126
01:20:59,490 --> 01:21:01,070
然后发了出去
and sent it out.

1127
01:21:01,150 --> 01:21:02,650
但这是你做的
But you created it?

1128
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:05,700
是的
Yes.

1129
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:06,570
为什么
Why?

1130
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:10,450
起初是真实的犯罪照片
At first, as a game idea

1131
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:11,950
激发的游戏创意
based on true crime photos.

1132
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:13,780
之后就变得奇怪了
Then it got weird.

1133
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:16,360
如果不是关那个浑蛋发送出去
Nobody would've seen it

即使她的牌位在他旁边 她也不会在那儿
She won't be there, even if her plaque's next to his.

Lost?

1274
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:52,490
我辞职了
I resigned.

1275
01:36:52,530 --> 01:36:54,570
- 你辞职了  - 我必须辞职
- You resigned?  - l had to.

1276
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:56,150
我的车坏了
My car broke down.

1277
01:36:57,070 --> 01:36:59,570
你因为车坏了 所以辞职了
You resigned because your car broke down?

1278
01:36:59,650 --> 01:37:02,780
上下班来回各要一个小时
It's one hour there, one hour back, from the house.

1279
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:04,240
那很不健康
That's unhealthy.

1280
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:08,700
我在电视上看到地铁里的空气质量
I saw a thing on TV about air quality in the subway.

1281
01:37:12,030 --> 01:37:13,570
你把他带来的吗

1282
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:19,110
- 我别无选择  - 别无选择

1283
01:37:20,990 --> 01:37:23,320
乔西威胁我说要去美国

1284
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:25,240
还要带着卢西恩
And take Lucien along.

1285
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:28,610
我不敢相信我居然向着她说话
I can't believe I'm defending her

1286
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:30,900
但她有权利和你生气
but she has a right to be mad at you.

1287
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:34,950
你有责任 要租房子 居然还辞职
You have responsibilities, an apartment, and you quit your job?

1288
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:37,150
她也是这么说的
You say it exactly like her.

1289
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:39,820
我的车坏了 又不是我的错
My car broke down. That's not my fault!

1290
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:42,320
你现在必须把宝宝送回去
You have to give that baby back right now.

1291
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,990
你们没结婚 别人可能认为你绑架孩子
You're not married. It could be seen as kidnapping.

1292
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:46,650
绑架 他是我的儿子
Kidnapping? He's my son!

1293

Who could that be?

1297
01:38:02,860 --> 01:38:03,740
他在哪儿
Where is he?

1298

1301
01:38:12,450 --> 01:38:13,360
我把他怎么样了
What did I do to him?

1302
01:38:13,450 --> 01:38:15,780
我连仓鼠都不敢托付给你
I wouldn't trust you with a hamster!

1303
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,280
放开我 放开我
Let go! Let go of me!

1304
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:19,650
放开她
Let go of her.

1305
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:21,450
放开我 该死
Let go of me, dammit!

1306
01:38:21,530 --> 01:38:23,240
放开她
Let go of her!

1307
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:24,650
放开我
Let go of me!

1308
01:38:27,530 --> 01:38:28,570

What?

1310
01:38:33,490 --> 01:38:35,240
这是我的孩子 明白吗
He's my baby, get it?

1311
01:38:37,150 --> 01:38:38,610
我的孩子
My child!

1312
01:38:50,950 --> 01:38:53,530
对你来说 一直都是为了孩子
It was always about the baby for you.

1313
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:56,700
你都是为了他
You were in it for his sake.

1314
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:00,610
我可以做个好父亲
I could be a good father.

1315
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:02,820

晚上好 米歇尔
Evening, Michèle.

1322
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:33,700
你的膝盖怎么样了

1323
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:35,360
你呢 你的手怎么样了
And you? Your hand?

1324
01:39:37,030 --> 01:39:38,070
帕特里克说邦尼维不加盐薯片

1325
01:39:38,150 --> 01:39:40,610

Rebecca's on a trip and left tons of lasagna.

1327
01:39:45,610 --> 01:39:47,610
我肯定吃不完
I'll never be able to finish it.

1328
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:50,610
我买了这个搭配着面吃
I got this to go with it.

1329
01:39:52,110 --> 01:39:53,450
听着不错
Sounds good to me.

1330
01:39:57,990 --> 01:39:59,610

1331
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:02,530

1332
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:07,240
瑞贝卡和父母去哪里旅行了
Where did Rebecca and her parents go?

1333
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:10,280
去圣地亚哥德孔波斯特拉见教皇
To see the Pope in Santiago de Compostela.

1334
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:13,200
开车 最后要步行
Driving and on foot at the end.

1335
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:15,950
我听说他会在大教堂里做弥撒
I saw he'll be saying mass in the cathedral.

1336
01:40:17,070 --> 01:40:17,950
教皇
The Pope.

1337
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:21,900
我想不到他光着脚的样子
I have a hard time imagining the guy barefoot.

1338
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:25,950
很难想象他是个真人 还有脚
It's so weird to think he's a real person, like with feet.

1339
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,150
少喝点 亲爱的
Go easy, sweetheart.

1340
01:40:45,110 --> 01:40:46,150
他睡着了
He's out.

1341
01:40:47,070 --> 01:40:48,950

地板很温暖
The floor's warm.

1344
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:30,700
我自己安装了地暖
It's a wood boiler. I installed it myself.

1345
01:41:32,530 --> 01:41:33,900
听着还挺难的
Sounds like a job.

1346
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:36,150
对
Yes.

1347
01:41:37,110 --> 01:41:39,200
火焰燃烧转换器
Works by inverted flame combustion.

1348
01:41:41,110 --> 01:41:43,200
火焰燃烧转换器
Inverted flame combustion?

1349
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:46,820
- 感觉好像你自己编的词  - 不
- Sounds like you just made it up.  - No.

1350
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:48,740
我没自己编
I'm not making anything up.

1351
01:41:58,200 --> 01:41:59,450
就在地下室里
It's in the basement.

1352
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:06,820
我能想象到
I can imagine.

1353
01:42:10,780 --> 01:42:12,200
想去看看吗
You want to see it?

1354
01:42:21,570 --> 01:42:22,490
好
Ok.

1355
01:43:01,450 --> 01:43:02,570
就是这儿了
There we are.

1356
01:43:04,990 --> 01:43:07,360
关上门 什么噪音也听不到
All noise is muffled by the door.

1357
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:21,200
- 文森特在楼上  - 是的
- Vincent's upstairs.  - Yes, he is.

1358
01:43:34,450 --> 01:43:35,400
来吧
Do it.

1359
01:43:41,570 --> 01:43:43,610
这样不信
It doesn't work like that.

1360
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:45,490
反正对我来说不行
Not for me.

1361
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:48,110
得要像之前一样
It has to be like before.

1362
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:56,650
我们走
Let's go.

1363
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:12,360
谢谢你的招待
Thank you for dinner.

1364
01:45:12,450 --> 01:45:13,320
客气了
Anytime.

1365
01:45:45,650 --> 01:45:46,360
库尔特
Kurt.

1366
01:45:48,030 --> 01:45:49,200
干得好
Bravo.

1367
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:55,860
安娜 我有个主意
Anna, I have an idea.

1368
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:57,820
游戏发布会的聚会
The party for the game launch.

1369
01:45:57,900 --> 01:45:59,780
我们可以让文森特来组织
we could ask Vincent to organize it.

1370
01:46:00,110 --> 01:46:01,200
好主意
Good idea.

1371
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:05,320
我知道我一直不愿意给文森特工作
I know I was always against throwing work Vincent's way but...

1372
01:46:08,110 --> 01:46:09,280
怎么了
What's wrong?

1373
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:15,030
罗伯特和其他人上床了
Robert's fucking someone.

1374
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:20,650
你确定吗
Are you sure?

1375
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:26,200
我认得那味道
I recognized the scent

1376
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:29,400
是他们在旅店用的破沐浴液
of that stupid body wash they use in hotels

1377
01:46:29,490 --> 01:46:31,240
还想显得高档
trying to be classy.

1378
01:46:31,610 --> 01:46:33,360
我们家不用那样的
We don't have that at home.

1379
01:46:36,570 --> 01:46:38,240
那是你唯一的证据吗
That's your only evidence?

1380
01:46:42,030 --> 01:46:43,990
我闻了他的内衣
I smelled his underwear.

1381
01:46:48,070 --> 01:46:51,570
我等了一夭等他把内裤脱下来
I waited all day for him to take off his shorts.

1382
01:46:52,030 --> 01:46:56,030
他最后脱下来后 我扑上去闻了闻
When he did at last, I pounced on them. And sniffed.

1383
01:46:57,990 --> 01:46:59,610
我感到无比羞愧
I felt ashamed beyond words.

1384
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:05,030
羞愧可不足以阻挡咱们做事
Shame isn't a strong enough emotion to stop us doing anything at all.

1385
01:47:06,610 --> 01:47:07,780
相信我
Believe me.

1386
01:47:28,150 --> 01:47:29,610
你要变成常客了
You're becoming a regular.

1387
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:31,150
好像是
Looks like it.

1388
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:33,530
- 你的妻子呢  - 她来不了
- Your wife?  - Couldn't make it.

1389
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:36,530
你啊是什么意思
What do you mean, "Ah''?

1390
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:39,450
我们应该一起来的 拼车现在正流行
We should've come together. Carpooling is hip.

1391
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:42,150
你好吗
How are you?

1392
01:47:42,530 --> 01:47:46,150

Fauchon made this up for us. Taste that. it's awesome.

1393
01:47:46,610 --> 01:47:48,490

01:47:50,150 --> 01:47:51,360
今晚你主持的吗

1401
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:06,570

1402

1404
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:13,360
不了 我不喜欢玩游戏
No, thanks, I'm no gamer.

1405
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:14,030
真的吗

1406
01:48:14,110 --> 01:48:16,570
- 我想试试 你教教我  - 好
- I'd love a go. Show me?  - Ok.

1408
01:48:21,570 --> 01:48:22,780

1409
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:24,740
- 香槟吗  - 红酒吧 谢谢

1410
01:48:24,820 --> 01:48:26,320

1411
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:28,990
- 你也要香槟吗  - 不了 谢谢

1413
01:48:32,150 --> 01:48:34,240

I was told to pour glasses.

1414
01:48:34,780 --> 01:48:35,860
这里我说了算
I'm in charge here.

1415
01:48:35,950 --> 01:48:37,820
给我的指令很明确
I was given specific instructions.

1416
01:48:37,990 --> 01:48:39,650
威士忌 谢谢
Whiskey here, please.

1417
01:48:47,490 --> 01:48:49,110
快点 再快点

1418
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:50,990
你可以按这个圆形
You can press the circle.

1419
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:52,780
现在让他走

1420
01:48:52,860 --> 01:48:54,150
按这里是跳
Press there to jump.

1421
01:48:57,070 --> 01:48:59,030
你怎么没带海琳一起
You didn't bring Hélène?

1422
01:48:59,610 --> 01:49:01,070
我们见过了
We've met now.

1423
01:49:02,150 --> 01:49:04,780
实话实说 我们结束了
I won't lie to you. It's over.

1424
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:06,780
发生什么了
What happened?

1425
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:12,200
躺在床上 我问她最喜欢我的哪本书
Laying in bed, I asked her which of my books was her favorite.

1426
01:49:12,650 --> 01:49:14,990
你问这个干吗
Why'd you do that?

1427
01:49:15,070 --> 01:49:16,740
她说《白杨香气》
She said Scent of Poplar.

1428
01:49:17,150 --> 01:49:18,610
《白杨香气》
Scent of Poplar

1429
01:49:19,070 --> 01:49:21,530
那是皮埃尔·卡沙的小说
is a novel by one Pierre Casamayou.

1430
01:49:32,530 --> 01:49:34,780
我都不知道有两个卡沙
I'd no idea there were two Casamayous.

1431
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:36,650
很显然 他很有才华
Apparently, he's talented.

1432
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:39,900
可怜的理查德
Poor Richard.

1433
01:49:40,150 --> 01:49:42,490
是的 可怜的理查德
Yes, poor Richard.

1434
01:49:56,110 --> 01:49:57,610
所以
So...

1435
01:49:58,070 --> 01:50:01,990
我们尽了最大的努力
it looks like somehow, despite our best efforts,

1436
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:04,740
现在终于成功了
we have a success on our hands.

1437
01:50:05,740 --> 01:50:08,070
我唯一能说的就是谢谢

1442
01:50:31,530 --> 01:50:34,240
我没有更好的言语来表达了
I couldn't put it any better.

1443
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:38,110
玩得开心
Have a great evening!

1444
01:50:42,490 --> 01:50:43,820
你见过理查德吗
Have you met Richard?

1445
01:50:43,950 --> 01:50:47,650
之前理查德提过一个非常有趣的提议
Some time ago, Richard pitched a very interesting idea.

1446
01:50:47,740 --> 01:50:51,570
你们两个携手 肯定会非常厉害
You two working together could make something fabulous of it.

1447
01:50:51,780 --> 01:50:53,030
至少我这么认为
I think, at least.

1448
01:50:53,740 --> 01:50:56,030
你们一起聊聊吧
Talk it over.

1449
01:50:57,200 --> 01:50:59,200
这不是施舍吗
This isn't charity?

1450
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:03,360
你该了解我的
You should know me better than that.

1451
01:51:03,450 --> 01:51:05,700
告诉他你的想法
Go on, tell him your idea.

1452
01:51:07,490 --> 01:51:09,320
我把它设计在
So, it's set in a...

1453
01:51:09,450 --> 01:51:11,280
我来给你拿杯喝的
Let me get you a drink.

1454
01:51:16,110 --> 01:51:18,530
我们随时可以走 亲爱的
We can go whenever you want, darling.

1455
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:21,320
我们在床上肯定比在这里有趣
We'll have more fun in bed than here.

1456
01:51:46,570 --> 01:51:48,570
伙计们 想来点威士忌吗
How about a whiskey, guys?

1457
01:51:50,650 --> 01:51:52,400
给我一分钟 然后我们就走
Give me a minute, then we can go.

1458
01:51:52,490 --> 01:51:54,110
随你

两杯威士忌 一杯橙汁 谢谢

1460

太棒了
It's going great!

1461
01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:08,110
是我
It's me.

1462
01:52:09,070 --> 01:52:10,150
什么是你
What's you?

1463
01:52:12,650 --> 01:52:14,650
和罗伯特上床的是我
It's me, sleeping with Robert.

1464
01:52:18,650 --> 01:52:20,900
现在都结束了 但那时是我
It's over now, but it was me.

1465
01:52:32,110 --> 01:52:33,200
多久了
How long?

1466
01:52:33,740 --> 01:52:34,900
六到八个月
6-8 months.

1467
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:43,860
我一点都不知道
I didn't have a clue.

1468
01:52:44,610 --> 01:52:45,990
我知道
I know.

1469
01:53:00,150 --> 01:53:01,610
你做什么了
What did you do?

1470
01:53:02,570 --> 01:53:04,240
我坦白了
I stopped lying.

1471
01:53:17,950 --> 01:53:19,280
- 再见  - 再见
- See you.  - See you.

拿着我的钥匙 帕特里克开车送我回去
Take my keys. Patrick's driving me home.

1473
01:53:23,700 --> 01:53:26,360
- 你这就要走了  - 你做得非常好
- You're leaving already?  - You did wonderfully.

1474
01:53:26,450 --> 01:53:27,490
放松
Relax.

1475
01:53:27,860 --> 01:53:28,780
再见
See you.

1476
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:46,700
变态
It's twisted.

1477
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:50,320
- 什么  - 变态
- Sorry?  - Twisted.

1478
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:53,200
我们之间是病态的
Between us, it's sick. Diseased.

1479
01:53:57,820 --> 01:54:01,320
我之前不承认 但我现在清楚了
I was in some kind of weird denial but I see clearly now.

1480
01:54:04,780 --> 01:54:06,280
你清楚什么了
What do you see?

1481
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:11,110
你对我做的事情 你以为你逃得掉
You don't expect to get away with what you did to me?

1482
01:54:15,610 --> 01:54:17,990
我马上会做我早该做的事
I'll do what I should've done at once.

1486
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:29,400
谁知道呢
Who knows.

1487
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:32,360
你什么意思
What do you mean?

1488
01:54:32,450 --> 01:54:36,150

1495

- 你好  - 你好

你和死者之间是什么关系
What was your relationship with the deceased?

1497
01:59:34,110 --> 01:59:35,700
他是我的邻居
He was my neighbor.

1498
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:39,650
只是一起喝咖啡的邻居吗
Like have-a-cup-of-coffee neighbor?

1499
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:42,280
还是互相借除草机的邻居
Borrow-the-lawnmower neighbor?

1500
01:59:42,990 --> 01:59:46,110
不 我从没借过他的除草机
No, I never borrowed his lawnmower.

1501

But it was...

1502
01:59:48,740 --> 01:59:51,110
对 是那种邻居
Yes, that kind of neighbor.

1503
01:59:51,200 --> 01:59:52,860
直到
Until maybe...

1504
01:59:54,860 --> 01:59:55,780
最近
recently.

1505
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:58,450
他和你一起参加这个聚会的时候吗

是的
Yes.

1507
02:00:01,030 --> 02:00:03,780
那时你们关系变得
That's when your relationship became

1508
02:00:04,490 --> 02:00:06,360
更加私人了吗
more personal?

1509
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:11,950
对 我的意思是
Yes. I mean...

1510
02:00:13,700 --> 02:00:15,650
是朝那个方向发展
It was heading in that direction.

1511
02:00:17,900 --> 02:00:20,700
当这个男人带着面具出现在你屋子里
When this man appeared in your house, masked,

1512
02:00:21,490 --> 02:00:26,110
你没怀疑过他可能是你的邻居吗
you never suspected for a moment it might be your neighbor?

1513
02:00:29,900 --> 02:00:32,280
谁会想到呢
Who could imagine such a thing?

1514
02:00:50,700 --> 02:00:52,700
- 颜色可以吗  - 刚刚好
- The color okay for you?  - Just fine.

1515
02:00:52,900 --> 02:00:54,030

It's perfect.

1516
02:01:07,240 --> 02:01:09,450

我损失了一点 但还可以
I took a bit of a hit, but not too bad.

1521

房地产经纪人很厉害
The realtor did a great job.

1522
02:01:22,450 --> 02:01:24,610
如果你需要 我把他联系方式给你

1523
02:01:24,700 --> 02:01:26,740
我哪里也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

1524
02:01:31,320 --> 02:01:32,900
东西都堆起来

1525
02:01:34,280 --> 02:01:35,990
我想告诉你
I wanted you to know...

1526
02:01:36,990 --> 02:01:38,360
我
I'm ...

1527
02:01:39,740 --> 02:01:42,450
你经历这些 我很难过
I'm very sorry for all you've been through.

1528
02:01:44,570 --> 02:01:46,360
幸运的是 我有信念
Fortunately, I have faith.

1529
02:01:47,110 --> 02:01:49,740
信念就是帮人度过艰难时期用的
What's it for if not to get through tough times?

1530
02:01:50,740 --> 02:01:54,780
帕特里克是个好人 但他的灵魂受了折磨
Patrick was a good man but he had a tortured soul.

1531
02:02:01,740 --> 02:02:03,650
- 再见  - 再见
- Goodbye.  - Goodbye.

1532

1535

02:03:35,530 --> 02:03:36,990
我人是在这里了
Physically, anyway.

1548
02:03:48,780 --> 02:03:50,990
我们要开展理查德的项目了
We're going ahead with Richard's project?

1549
02:03:51,070 --> 02:03:53,320
让他胡闹一段时间吧
Let him fool around for a while.

1550
02:03:55,700 --> 02:03:57,280
罗伯特怎么样

1551
02:03:59,900 --> 02:04:02,280
- 我把他赶出去了  - 不是吧
- I kicked him out.  - No.

1552
02:04:02,820 --> 02:04:04,990
从那之后他就触底了
Ever since, he's hit the bottle.

1553
02:04:05,990 --> 02:04:07,650
你看上他什么了
What did you see in him?

1554
02:04:08,280 --> 02:04:10,070
就是那么一样
It was just one of those things.

1555
02:04:10,530 --> 02:04:11,700
一个机会
An opportunity.
