3
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,300
藩 篱

4
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,860
特洛伊，你别再说谎了
Troy, you ought to stop that lying.

5
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,560
我没有说谎
I ain't lying.

6
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,430
那个黑人藏着个这么大的西瓜
Nigger had a watermelon this big,

7
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,370
还说：什么西瓜，伦德先生？
talking about, "what watermelon, Mr. Rand?"

8
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,100
我真想上前跟他对质，还“什么西瓜，伦德先生？”
I'd like to fell out. "What watermelon, Mr. Rand?"

9
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,810
那个西瓜就大大的放在那
And it sitting there, big as life.

10
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,910
- 那伦德先生说了什么？ - 他没说什么
- What Mr. Rand say?  - He ain't said nothing.

11
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,580
他知道，如果这个黑人那么愚蠢
He figure, if the nigger was too dumb

12
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,740
不知道自己在藏着一个西瓜
to know he's carrying a watermelon,

13
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,680
他也不能跟他说道理
he wasn't going to get much sense out of him.

14
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,580
他把那大西瓜藏在他的外衣下
Trying to hide that great, big, old watermelon under his coat.

15
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,390
害怕让那些白人看到他偷回家
Afraid to let the white man see him carry it home.

16
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,720
我像你一样，我没有时间跟这种蠢人相处
I'm like you. I ain't got no time for them kinda people.

17
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,460
告诉我，为何那个人看起来那么生气
Now, what he look like getting mad

18
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,490
在他看到从工会来的人跟伦德先生说话之后？
'cause he seen the man from the union talking to Mr. Rand?

19
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,890
他上前跟我说
He come up to me, talking about

20
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,730
特洛伊·马克森早晚会让我们失去工作的
"Troy Maxson gonna get us fired."

21
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,900
我跟他说：别跟我说这个
I told him, "get away from me with that."

22
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,630
他一边走一边说你是专门制造麻烦的人
He walked away from me calling you a troublemaker.

23
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,630
伦德先生怎样说？
What Mr. Rand say?

24
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,470
他没说什么，只叫我
He ain't said nothing. Told me to go down

25
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,410
下星期五到理事长的办公室，停下！
to the commissioner's office next Friday. Whoa!

26
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,870
他们叫我去那里会面
They called me down there to see them.

27
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,440
你一天还在投诉当中
Well, as long as you got your complaint filed,

28
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,410
他们就不能辞退你
they can't fire you.

29
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,810
那是一个白人跟我说的
That's what one of them white fellas tell me.

30
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,150
我才不担心他们会辞退我
I ain't worried about them firing me.

31
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,620
就因为我问了个问题，他们就要辞退我？
What, they gonna fire me 'cause I asked a question?

32
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,720
我只问了个问题
That's all I did.

33
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,790
还说：什么西瓜，伦德先生？
I went to Mr. Rand and I asked him.

34
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,060
我问他：为何？
I asked him, "why?

35
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,190
为何你让所有白人负责驾驶，而有色人种就去搬运？
Why you got all the white mens driving, and the colored lifting?"

36
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,190
跟他说：什么事了？我不重要吗？
Told him, "what's the matter? Don't I count?

37
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,460
你以为只有白人才够聪明去驾驶吗？
Think only white fellows got sense enough to drive a truck?"

38
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,660
该死的，那又不是写文件，任何人都懂驾驶
"Hell, that ain't no paper job. Anybody can drive a truck.

39
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,930
你为何让所有白人驾驶，而有色人种去搬运？
"How come you got all the whites driving and the colored lifting?"

40
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,900
他回答我：去跟工会说吧
He told me, "take it to the union."

41
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,470
该死的，我就去投诉
Well, hell, that's what I done.

42
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,640
而现在他们就想说一堆谎话隐瞒过去
Now they want to come up with this pack of lies.

43
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,970
我跟布朗尼说了，如果那些人向他查询
I told Brownie if the man come and ask him any questions,

44
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,580
就即管告诉事实
just tell the truth.

45
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,480
这只不过是因为你投诉了
Ain't nothing but somebody trumped it up on you

46
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,610
所以有人要诬蔑你
'cause you filed a complaint on.

47
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,850
布朗尼没那么聪明
Brownie ain't got that much sense.

48
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,180
他什么事也不去想
Man wasn't thinking about nothing.

49
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,950
我只想他们改正职位描述
All I want them to do is change the job description,

50
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,520
给所有人一个机会去驾驶，开车
give everybody a chance to drive the truck. Oi!

51
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,590
布朗尼没想过这，他不是很聪明
Brownie can't see that. He ain't got that much sense.

52
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,910
你怎么知道他一直在跟
How you figure he be making out

53
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,580
泰勒的酒吧里那个女子调情？
with that gal, be up in Taylors' all the time?

54
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,250
- 那个叫艾伯塔的女子  - 谁？
- That Alberta gal?  - Who?

55
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,220
布朗尼
Brownie.

56
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,020
我跟他经常在一起，就像我们一样
Same as you and me, getting about as much as we is.

57
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,760
- 心照不宣吧  - 是吗？
- Which is to say nothing.  - It is, huh?

58
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,490
我想你比我更猜得透他吧
Well, I figure you doing a little better than me.

59
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,890
我不会跟你说我在猜什么
And I ain't saying what I'm doing!

60
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,860
朋友，听着，我太了解你
Nigger, look here. I know you.

61
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,900
难怕你只接近了她一点
If you had gotten anywhere near that gal,

62
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,270
二十分钟后你就想跟谁说了
20 minutes later, you'd be looking to tell somebody.

63
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,770
而你第一个想要分享的对象
And the first one you gonna want to tell,

64
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,800
想要吹嘘的对象就是我
that you gonna want to brag to is going to be me.

65
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,270
我不会这样做
Oh, I ain't saying that.

66
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,570
我看到你在偷看她
I see where you be eyeing her.

67
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,840
我所有女人都看，我不会错过任何女人
I eye all the women. I don't miss nothing.

68
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,150
别听别人说…
Don't never let nobody tell you

69
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,180
特洛伊·马克森不看女人
Troy Maxson don't eye the women.

70
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,650
你顗觎她呢
Hey, you been doing more than eyeing her.

71
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,920
你请她喝酒了
You done bought her a drink or two.

72
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,250
天啊，我是请过她，那又如何？
Hell, yeah, I bought her a drink. What that mean?

73
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,620
我也请过你喝酒
I bought you one, too.

74
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,250
那算什么，就因为我请她喝了一杯？
What that mean, 'cause I buy her a drink?

75
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,550
我只是出于礼貌
I'm just being polite.

76
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,760
你请她喝一杯完全可以
It's all right to buy her one drink.

77
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,620
那就是出于礼貌
That's what you call being polite.

78
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,290
但当你继续请她喝酒
But when you want to be buying two or three,

79
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,830
那就是顗觎
that's what you call eyeing her.

80
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,660
听着，你认识我这样久了
Look here. As long as you've known me,

81
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,630
你有听过我去追求女人吗？
you ever known me to chase after women?

82
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,870
当然有，一直认识你以来你都有
Hell, yeah! Long as I've known you.

83
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,300
你忘了我认识你多久了
You're forgetting, I knew you when.

84
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,570
我在说在我跟罗斯结婚后
I'm talking about since I been married to Rose.

85
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,740
噢…那倒没有
Oh... not since you been married to Rose.

86
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,270
我可以说，那倒是真的
That's the truth, though. I can say that.

87
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,910
明白了吧，没什么可说
All right then. Case closed.

88
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,280
我在艾伯塔的房子外看见过你
I see you be walking up around Alberta's house.

89
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,750
那种时候你应该在泰勒的酒吧才对
You supposed to be at Taylors',

90
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,050
而你却在那里出现了
and you be walking up around there.

91
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,320
你为何在意我去哪？
What you watching where I'm walking for?

92
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,490
我也没在意你去哪
I don't be watching after you.

93
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,650
不，我看见你在那里不只一次
No, I seen you walking around there more than once.

94
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,130
当然，我们经常在一起
Hell, you liable to see me walking anywhere.

95
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,990
你看到我在那里不代表什么
That don't mean nothing 'cause you seen me walking around there.

96
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,320
她从哪来的？
Where'd she come from, anyway?

97
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,760
她就好像突然出现一样
She just kinda showed up one day.

98
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,060
塔拉哈西，你看到她
Tallahassee. You can look at that

99
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,030
就知道她是来自佛罗里达州[塔拉哈西是其首府]
and tell she one of them Florida gals.

100
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,570
那里的女人都亭亭玉立
They got some big, healthy women down there.

101
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,300
就像树一样高大
Grow them right up out of the ground.

102
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,940
她有印度人的血统
She got a little bit of Indian in her.

103
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,900
很多在佛罗里达州的黑人都有印度人血统
Most of them niggers in Florida got some Indian in them.

104
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,970
我不知道她是不是混血儿
Yeah, I don't know about that Indian part,

105
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,010
但她真的很高大
but she damn sure big and healthy.

106
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,080
要是让她穿上长袜
Woman wears some big stockings.

107
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,620
再张开她那双诱人的腿，真棒
Got them crazy big legs, and hips wide as the Mississippi river.

108
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,950
双腿并不重要
Legs don't mean nothing.

109
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,790
它们只会在做爱时阻碍你
You don't do nothing but push 'em out of the way.

110
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,350
但是臀部可重要了
But them hips,

111
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,790
它们坐在你上面时软呼呼的
they cushion the ride.

112
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,590
特洛伊，不能这样算
Troy, you ain't got no sense!

113
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,660
那是真的，像你年轻做爱时一样
It's the truth. Like you riding on goodyears!

114
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,700
你们在这里都在聊什么了？
What you all out here getting into?

115
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,930
女人，你为何在意我们在聊什么？
What you worried about what we getting into for, woman?

116
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,010
这是男人之间的讨论
This is men talk.

117
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,640
我又怎么会在意呢？
What I care what you all are talking about?

118
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,940
博诺，你要留下来吃晚餐吗？
Bono, you gonna stay for supper?

119
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,340
不了，谢谢，罗斯
No, thank you, Rose,

120
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,770
露西尔说她今晚要煮猪脚
but Lucille say she cooking up a pot of pigfeet.

121
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,840
猪脚？那我也跟你回去了
Pigfeet? Hell, I'm going home with you.

122
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,110
要是你家煮猪脚，我甚至会在你那睡一晚
I might even stay the night, you got some pigfeet.

123
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,050
罗斯，你里面有煮什么比猪脚还棒的吗？
You got something in there to top them pigfeet, Rose?

124
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,620
我在煮鸡肉，今晚吃鸡肉和羽衣甘蓝叶
I'm cooking up some chicken. I got some chicken and collard greens.

125
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,820
那你先进去继续烹调
Well, you go on back in the house.

126
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,050
让博诺和我继续刚才的话题
Let me and Bono finish what we talking about.

127
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,920
这是男人之间的讨论，我待会也有些事要跟你讨论
This is men talk. I got some talk for you later.

128
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,960
你也知道我要说什么的
And you know what kind of talk I mean, too.

129
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,690
你先进去准备下[指做爱]
You go on in there and powder it up.

130
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:34,990
特洛伊，够了！
Troy, stop it!

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,030
噢，来吧，女人
Oh, woman, come here.

132
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,400
博诺，听着
Oh! Look here, Bono.

133
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,940
我第一次看到这女人时
When I first met this woman,

134
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,840
我就行动了
I got out that place there.

135
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,840
我准备好我的马匹
Hitch up my pony, saddle up my mare

136
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,640
因为那里有个女人在等着我
there's a woman out there for me somewhere

137
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,380
我到处找寻她的踪影
I looked at here, looked at there,

138
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,710
然后看到罗斯时我就彻底被她迷住了
saw Rose, and I latched on to her.

139
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,680
我想也没想就上前跟她说…
I latched on to her and I told her...

140
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,050
我来告诉你当时到底发生了什么事
Now, I'm gonna tell you the truth.

141
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,720
我跟她说：宝贝，我不想要结婚
I latched on to her and told her, "baby, I don't want to marry.

142
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,190
我只想成为你的男人
"I just want to be your man."

143
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,890
罗斯回答我…你来告诉他，罗
Rose told me... Tell him what you told me, Ro.

144
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,860
我跟他说如果他不打算长相厮守
I told him if he wasn't the marrying kind,

145
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,030
那就滚开，别挡着那些想的人前来
then move out of the way, so the marrying kind could find me.

146
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,730
她真这么说了：朋友，你在挡着我
That's what she told me, "nigger, you in my way.

147
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,000
你在阻挡我的视线
"You blocking the view.

148
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
滚开，让我找我的爱人
"Move out the way, so I can find me a husband."

149
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,740
- 我想了几天  - 你才没有
- I thought it over 2-3 days.  - Two-three days, nothing.

150
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,070
你那晚就回来了
You was back the same night.

151
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,410
我回来并跟她说：好吧，宝贝
I come back, told her, "okay, baby,

152
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,150
但我要买一只矮脚公鸡[比正常公鸡小，但好斗]
"but I'm gonna buy me a banty rooster

153
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,980
把它放在后院里
"and put him out there in the backyard.

154
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,690
当它看到陌生人
"And when he see a stranger come,

155
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,420
它就会到处跑跟大声啼叫
"he gonna flap his wings and crow."

156
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,290
博诺，看这里，我看着前门就够烦了
Look here, Bono. I done watched that front door by myself.

157
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,990
我担心的是[她的]后庭
It was that back door I was worried about.

158
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,820
特洛伊，别说了，你在撒谎
Don't talk like that! Troy, you're not but telling a lie.

159
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,190
但是我们结婚后才发现
Only thing was, we first got married,

160
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,930
忘了那公鸡吧，因为我们根本负担不起后院
forget the rooster. We ain't had no yard.

161
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
我也明白
I hear you tell it.

162
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,770
露西尔和我以前住在洛根街[美国，丹佛]
Me and Lucille was staying down there on Logan street.

163
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,100
我们有两间房子，还有个厕所在后院里
Had two rooms with the outhouse in the back.

164
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,900
我平常都不介意的
I ain't mind the outhouse none.

165
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,440
但当冬天时有阵该死的冷锋吹过
But when that goddamn wind blew through there in the winter,

166
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,170
我就恨死它了！[以前家里没有水管]
that's what I'm talking about!

167
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,940
直至今天，我还在想
To this day, I wonder why the hell

168
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,450
为何我会住在那里六年之久
I ever stayed down there for six long years.

169
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,010
我当时也不知道可以怎办
But, see, I didn't know I could do no better.

170
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,880
我以为只有白人才配有室内厕所什么的
I thought only white folks had inside toilets and things.

171
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,060
很多人也像这样
A lot of folks don't think

172
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,820
安于现状
they can do no better than they're doing now.

173
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,020
那是些要改变的想法
Just something you gotta learn.

174
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,960
就像很多人还去贝拉的店买东西
A lot of folks still shop at Bella's.

175
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,760
贝拉卖的东西没问题啊，她卖的食物也很新鲜
Ain't nothing wrong with Bella's. She got fresh food.

176
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,490
我不是在说她卖的食物有没有问题
I ain't said nothing about if she got fresh food.

177
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,960
我在说她卖的价钱
I'm talking about what she charge.

178
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,930
同样的货品她比A&P卖贵十美分
She charges 10 cents more than the A&P.

179
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,500
A&P没为我做过什么
A&P ain't never done nothing for me.

180
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,470
我会选择消费在我认为对的地方
I spend my money where I'm treated right.

181
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,740
我到贝拉的店里说
I go down to Bella, say,

182
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,240
我要买一条面包，星期五付钱，她就给我了
"i need a loaf of bread, I'll pay you Friday," she gives it to me.

183
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,210
如果我还在
What sense that make when I got money

184
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,810
其他地方消费
to spend it somewhere else

185
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,240
把这个卖人情给我的人忘掉，我还算什么？
and ignore the person who done right by me?

186
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,450
圣经里没教人忘恩负义
That ain't in the Bible.

187
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,180
我们不是在谈论圣经
We ain't talking about what's in the Bible.

188
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,080
明知道她卖贵了，还在那买东西，这样理智吗？
What sense it make to shop there when she overcharges?

189
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,920
那你去你想去的地方买
Well, you do your shopping where you want to,

190
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,790
我去卖过人情给我的地方买
I do my shopping where people been good to me.

191
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,250
噢，我只是不认同她卖贵了而已
Oh, I don't think it's right for her to overcharge, that's all.

192
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,790
听着，我该走了
Look here, I got to be getting on.

193
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,120
露西尔都要发怒了
Lucille gonna be raising all kind of hell.

194
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,890
朋友，你要去哪，我们还没喝完这瓶呢
Where you going, nigger? We ain't finished this pint.

195
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,160
先喝完吧
Come here finish this pint.

196
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,060
我会留下啊，如果你请我喝的话
Well, hell, I am, if you ever turn the bottle loose.

197
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,030
我唯一要感谢A&P的地方
Only thing I'll say about the A&P is,

198
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,330
就是他们让科丽在那工作
I'm glad Cory got that job down there.

199
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,830
帮补一下他的开支
Help him with his school clothes and things.

200
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,870
加布搬走了，我们有点捉襟见肘
Gabe done moved out, things getting tight around here.

201
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,110
他有份工作
He got that job,

202
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,840
至少可以照顾下自己
he can start to look out for himself.

203
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,080
科丽被一间大学的美式足球队录取了
Cory done got recruited by a college football team.

204
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,210
我跟他说过大学的美式足球队到底是怎么一回事
I told that boy about that college football stuff.

205
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,120
那些白人不会让他碰美式足球的
The white man ain't gonna let him get nowhere with that football.

206
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,190
他第一次来我就跟他解释过了
I told him when he first come to me with it.

207
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,990
现在你告诉我他更着迷了
Now, you come telling me he done got more tied up in it.

208
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,090
他该去车行工作
He ought to get recruited in how to fix cars,

209
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,760
还是做点能令他过活的事
or some way he can make a living.

210
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,960
他不是想成为职业美式足球员
He ain't talking about making no living playing football.

211
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,000
那只是他的兴趣而已
It's just something the boys in school do.

212
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,520
他们会派负责人员来
They're gonna send a recruiter by

213
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,070
跟你商讨，他会跟你说
to talk to you. He'll tell you.

214
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,200
他不是想成为职业美式足球员
He ain't talking about making no living playing football.

215
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,940
被录取是个荣誉
It's an honor to be recruited.

216
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,300
他不会走得远的，博诺就懂
It ain't gonna get him nowhere, Bono'll tell you that.

217
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,870
如果他跟你一样那么有运动细胞，他会成为伟大的球员
If he be like you in sports, he gonna be all right.

218
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,240
这么久以来只有两个人打棒球比你好
Ain't but two men ever played baseball good as you.

219
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,310
就是贝比·鲁斯和乔什·吉普森[皆为著名棒球员]
That's Babe Ruth and Josh Gibson.

220
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,850
他们就是唯一比你有更多全垒打的人
Them the only two men ever hit more home runs than you.

221
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,080
打棒球给了我什么？我没有地方上厕所
And what it ever get me? I ain't got a pot to piss in,

222
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,360
又或者靠此买过一间房子
or a window to throw it out of.

223
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,220
时代不同了，特洛伊
Times have changed since you were playing baseball, Troy.

224
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,290
你打棒球都是战争之前了，很多事情都改变了
That was before the war. Times have changed a lot since then.

225
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,560
有什么改变了？
How the hell they done changed?

226
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,160
现在很多有色人种都在球队里
They got a lot of colored boys playing ball now.

227
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,590
棒球也好，美式足球也好
Baseball and football.

228
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,900
罗，你说对了，时代不同了，特洛伊
You right about that, Ro. Times have changed, Troy.

229
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,270
你只是生不逢时而已
You just come along too early.

230
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,000
世上没有所谓“生不逢时”
There ought not never have been no time called "too early."

231
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,840
以他为例…
Now you take that fellow...

232
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,370
那个以前在洋基队
What's that fellow they had playing

233
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,640
当右外野手的叫什么？
right field back then for the Yankees?

234
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,580
博诺，你该记得的
You remember who I'm talking about, Bono,

235
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,930
在洋基队当右外野手的那个
played right field for the Yankees.

236
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,310
- 塞尔柯克？ - 对，就是他
- Selkirk?  - Yeah, Selkirk, that's it!

237
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,920
他的职业生涯打击率是点二六九，你看得出了吗？
Man's batting 269, you understand? 269!

238
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,590
那合理吗？我的打击率是点四三二，有三十七个是全垒打
What sense that make? I'm batting 432 with 37 home runs!

239
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,860
他的打击率才点二六九，却在洋基队里当右外野手！
He's batting 269, playing right field for the Yankees!

240
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,990
我昨天看到乔什·吉普森的女儿
I saw Josh Gibson's daughter yesterday.

241
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,630
她穿着破烂的鞋到处跑
She's running around with raggedy shoes on her feet.

242
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,230
我敢打赌塞尔柯克的女儿
I bet you Selkirk's daughter ain't running around

243
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,160
可不是穿着什么破烂的到处走
with no raggedy shoes on her feet. I bet you that.

244
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,100
现在很多职业棒球员都是有色人种了
They got a lot of colored baseball players now.

245
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,240
杰基·罗宾森是第一个
Jackie Robinson was the first.

246
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,270
杰基·罗宾森都是名星了
Folks had to wait for Jackie Robinson.

247
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,170
我看过无数比杰基·罗宾森还会打棒球的黑人
I done seen 100 niggers play baseball better than Jackie Robinson.

248
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,180
我甚至看过杰基·罗宾森都进不了的球队
Hell, I seen some teams Jackie Robinson couldn't even make!

249
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,410
还说什么杰基·罗宾森？
What you talking about, Jackie Robinson?

250
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,250
杰基·罗宾森只是个无名小卒而已！
Jackie Robinson wasn't nobody!

251
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,910
我要说的是如果你会打球
I'm talking about if you could play ball,

252
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,180
他们就该给你机会
then they ought to let you play.

253
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,350
而不是在意你的肤色人种
Don't matter what color you are.

254
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,180
还说我生不逢时
Come telling me I come along too early.

255
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,390
如果你会打球，他们就该给你机会
If you can play, then they ought to let you play.

256
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,020
你再继续这么喝会死的
You gonna drink yourself to death.

257
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,060
不用喝那么多吧
You don't need to be drinking like that.

258
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,290
噢，死神而已，我都见过了
Oh! Death ain't nothing. I done seen him,

259
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,330
还跟他搏斗过，不用你来跟我说
I done wrestled with him. You can't tell me nothing about death.

260
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,930
死神不过是个外角的快速球
Death ain't nothing but a fastball on the outside corner,

261
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,900
而你知道我有什么能耐
and you know what I do with that.

262
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,670
博诺，看这里，我有在说谎吗？
Look here, Bono, am I lying?

263
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,640
你扔个到腰水平高度的快速球
You get one of them fastballs about waist high

264
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,240
从外角扔过来
on the outside corner of the plate

265
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,110
那简直易如反掌
where you can get the meat of the bat on it,

266
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,350
老天啊，我会把它打到出场外
and, good god, you could kiss it good-bye.

267
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,420
- 我在吹嘘吗？ - 不，你在说事实
- Am I lying?  - No, you telling the truth.

268
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,590
我亲眼看见过
I seen you do it.

269
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,090
如果我在吹牛，那会是天大的谎话
If I'm lying, that's 450 feet worth of lying.

270
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,260
死神来我来说就是这么回事
That's all death is to me.

271
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,930
一个从外角扔来的快速球
A fastball on the outside corner.

272
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,190
我不知道你为何说起死亡了？
I don't know why you want to get on talking about death?

273
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,430
说说又没有问题
Ain't nothing wrong with talking about death.

274
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,330
那是生命的一部分啊，每个人都必经
That's a part of life! Everybody gonna die.

275
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,930
你会死，我会死
You gonna die. I'm gonna die.

276
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,670
博诺会死，天啊，所有人都会死
Bono gonna die. Hell, we all gonna die.

277
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,000
但你也没必要继续说吧
But you ain't got to talk about it.

278
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,140
我不喜欢说这种事
I don't like talking about it.

279
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,300
那是你提起的
Well, you the one brought it up.

280
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,110
博诺和我刚才在说棒球
Me and Bono talking about baseball.

281
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,140
你突然说我会喝死
You come telling me I'm gonna drink myself to death.

282
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,110
不是吗，博诺？
Ain't that right, Bono?

283
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,710
你知道我一周只有一晚去喝酒
Now you know I drink just but one night out the week,

284
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,680
那是星期五晚
that's Friday night.

285
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,950
我不会喝多
I drink just enough to where I can handle it.

286
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,920
然后我就会离开，不碰它了
Then I leaves it alone. I cuts it loose.

287
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,420
所以你不必担心我会喝死
So, you ain't got to worry about me drinking myself to death

288
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,190
因为我不害怕死亡
'cause I ain't worrying about death.

289
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,020
我见过他，跟他搏斗过
I done seen him, done wrestled with him.

290
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,190
跟你说，博诺
Look here, Bono.

291
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,430
我有天看到死神举军冲向我
I look up one day, and death is marching straight at me,

292
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,700
像是阅兵时的士军队一样
like soldiers on parade.

293
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,200
当时死神大军在冲向我
The army of death was marching straight at me.

294
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,470
当时是一九四一年七月中
It was the middle of July, 1941.

295
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,040
然而却像冬天一般冷
And it got real cold, just like it be winter.

296
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,470
那时候死神他啊
And it seemed like death, himself,

297
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,710
好像举手碰了我肩膀一下
reached out and touched me on the shoulder.

298
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:26,180
他像我现在碰你一样，我感受到那寒意
He touched me like I touch you now. I got cold as ice.

299
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,380
死神就站在那里，对我露出不友善的笑容
Death standing there, grinning at me.

300
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,250
特洛伊，别说了
Troy, why don't you hush that talk.

301
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,480
我说：死神先生，你想要什么？要带走我吗？
I said, "what you want, Mr. death? You be wanting me?

302
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,450
你不再派你的小卒来了吗？
"You done sent your army to be getting me?"

303
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,240
我直直的看着他
I looked him dead in the eye.

304
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,460
我什么都不怕
I wasn't fearing nothing.

305
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,460
我准备跟他斗个你死我活，直至现在我都是！
I was ready to tangle, just like I'm ready to tangle now!

306
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,760
圣经说要经常警惕
Bible says be ever vigilant.

307
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,200
所以我不会喝醉，我还要耳听八方
So, I don't get but so drunk. I got to keep watch.

308
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,000
特洛伊当时进了慈善医院
Troy was right down there at mercy hospital.

309
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:46,970
你记得他那次得了肺炎
You remember he had that pneumonia,

310
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,300
还有发烧，躺在床上还说些有的没的
laying there with a fever, talking plumb out his head.

311
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,540
当时死神站在那盯着我
And death standing there, staring at me,

312
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,200
手握着镰刀
carrying that sickle in his hand.

313
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:58,110
终于，他说：你想再活多一年吗？
Finally, he say, "you want to be bound over for another year?"

314
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,280
他这样说
Just like that. He say,

315
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,220
你想再活多一年吗？
"you want to be bound over for another year?"

316
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,250
我说：去你的，我们现在就说清楚
I said, "bound over, hell! We can settle this right now."

317
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,290
他听了后退后了点
He kinda fell back when I said that.

318
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,760
我即时龙精虎猛
And all the cold went out of me.

319
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,090
我伸手抢去他的镰刀
I reached down, I grabbed that sickle.

320
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,560
我用尽力气扔走它
I threw it as far as I could throw it,

321
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,400
然后我们开始埋身肉搏
and me and him commenced to wrestling.

322
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,130
我们打了…六…三天三夜
We wrestled for... Carry the six... Three days and three nights!

323
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,400
我不知道从哪儿来的力量
Now, I don't know where I got the strength from,

324
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,270
因为他处于优势时
'cause every time he tried to get the best of me,

325
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:28,070
我重新振作
I reached way deep down inside myself,

326
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,410
并又得到对抗他的力量
found the strength to do him one better.

327
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,210
特洛伊每次说起这事
Every time Troy tells that story,

328
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,410
都有不同的版本
he find different ways to tell it,

329
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,110
不同的谎话
different things to make up.

330
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,450
我没有胡说，女人
I ain't making up nothing, woman.

331
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,220
我在说实话
I'm telling you the facts of what happened.

332
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,450
我跟死神搏斗了三天三夜
I wrestled with death for three days and three nights,

333
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,190
而现在还能站着跟你说话
and I'm standing here to tell you about it.

334
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,320
继续，在最后
All right. At the end of the third night,

335
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,430
我们都脆弱得站不起来了
we done weakened each other to where we can't even hardly move.

336
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,400
死神突然站起来
Death stood up.

337
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,800
他披上那连帽的白色袍子
He threw on that robe, had a white robe with a hood on it.

338
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,270
他披上后便去寻找他的镰刀
He throwed on that robe and ent off to look for that sickle.

339
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:00,140
他说：我会回来的，像这样
He said, "I'll be back." Just like that. "I'll be back."

340
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,280
我说：是吗？那你得好好找我
I said, "yeah? Well, you gonna have to find me!"

341
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,410
我又不是傻子
I wasn't no fool.

342
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,410
我不会自找麻烦的
I wasn't going looking for him.

343
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,850
我知道死亡不是拿来开玩笑的事，他早晚会找上我
I know death ain't nothing to play with. And I know he's gonna get me.

344
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,150
我知道我早晚要加入他的大军
I know I got to join his army, his camp followers.

345
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,150
但我一天还有力气
But as long as I keep up my strength and see him coming,

346
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,420
还能保持警觉
as long as I keep up my vigilance,

347
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,120
他就得打上一场硬仗
he gonna have to fight to get me.

348
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,360
我不会轻易让他带走我
I ain't going easy.

349
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,400
那你看，既然你要保持警觉
Well, look here, since you got to keep up your vigilance,

350
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
让我替你拿着那酒瓶
let me have the bottle.

351
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,870
该死的，我不应该告诉你那部分
Hell, I shouldn't have told you that part.

352
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,320
我应该删掉那部分
I should have left out that part.

353
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,210
特洛伊一直都说这些话
Troy be talking all that stuff.

354
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,240
然而有一半时候他根本不知道自己在说什么
Half the time, he don't even know what he be talking about!

355
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,270
- 博诺会了解的  - 对，我很了解你
- Yeah, Bono know me better than that.  - That's right, I know you.

356
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,440
我知道你就像雷默斯大叔一样[说故事的人]
I know you got some Uncle Remus in your blood.

357
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,850
你有的故事比魔鬼拥有的罪人还多
You got more stories than the devil got sinners.

358
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,480
天啊，我也跟他说过话
Oh, hell, I done seen him, too. Done talked to the devil.

359
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,520
没人想知道
Nobody wants to be hearing that stuff!

360
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,320
嗨，爸
Hey, pop.

361
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,890
你来这里做什么？
What you come "hey, poppin'" me for?

362
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,190
你好吗，罗斯？
How you doing, Rose?

363
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,560
博诺先生，你好吗？
Mr. Bono, how you doing?

364
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,430
嗨，里昂，你呢？
Hey, Lyons, how you been?

365
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,870
他一定过得很好
He must've been doing all right.

366
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,100
他整周都没来找过我
I ain't seen him around here last week.

367
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,900
特洛伊，放过你的儿子吧，他特地来看你
Troy, leave your boy alone. He come by to see you

368
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,470
而你却又想胡说
and you want to start all that nonsense.

369
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,900
我没有说里昂什么，来喝口
I ain't bothering Lyons. Here, get you a drink.

370
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,880
我们知道原因
Me and him got an understanding.

371
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,610
我知道他为何来，而他也知道
I know why he come by to see me, and he know I know.

372
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,580
爸，别这样说，我只是来见你一下
Come on, pop. I just stopped by to say hi,

373
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,550
看看你过得怎样了
see how you was doing.

374
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,910
- 但你昨天没来啊  - 里昂，你留下来吃晚饭吗？
- You ain't stopped by yesterday.  - You staying for supper, Lyons?

375
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:15,890
我在煮鸡肉
I got some chicken cooking in the oven.

376
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,220
不了，罗斯，谢谢，我刚巧经过这里而已
No, Rose, thanks. I just was in the neighborhood

377
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,550
想着进来看你们一下
and thought I'd stop by for a minute.

378
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,220
得了吧，你刚巧经过这
Yeah, you was in the neighborhood all right.

379
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,190
老兄，你还真会说话
Nigger, you telling the truth there.

380
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,360
你刚巧经过这因为我今天发薪
You was in the neighborhood 'cause it's my payday.

381
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,660
既然你提到了，给我十块
Well, hell, since you mentioned it, let me have $10.

382
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,500
该死的，我宁愿下地狱
I'll be damned. I'll die and go to hell

383
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,230
和魔鬼玩牌也不会给你
and play Blackjack with the devil before I give you $10.

384
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:36,200
我想知道你看见过的魔鬼
That's what I want to know about, that devil you done seen.

385
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,370
爸看见过魔鬼？真会吹牛
Pop done seen the devil? You too much, pop.

386
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,540
- 对，我见过  - 他才没有
- Yeah, I done seen him.  - He ain't seen no devil.

387
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,670
我跟他说过那男人不是魔鬼
I told him that man ain't had nothing to do with the devil.

388
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,940
他把任何他不明白的事，都称呼为魔鬼
Anything he can't understand, he want to call it the devil.

389
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,350
看这，博诺，我去赫茨伯格的店买些家具
Look here, Bono. I go by Hertzberger's to get some furniture.

390
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,250
收音机说三房寓所只售两百九十八
You got three rooms for $298. That what it say on the radio.

391
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,520
三房寓所只售两百九十八，他还为此创作了首歌
"Three rooms, $298." He made up a little song about it.

392
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,590
我去到那，他说我不能贷款
I get down there, man tell me I can't get no credit.

393
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,960
我每天都工作，还不能贷款
I'm working every day, can't get no credit.

394
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,930
那怎办？
What to do?

395
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,960
我只有些破烂的家具
I got an empty house with some raggedy furniture.

396
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,930
科丽没有床
Cory ain't got no bed.

397
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,400
他在地上铺点破布就睡了
He's sleeping on a pile of rags on the floor.

398
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,500
每天都工作，却不能贷款
Working every day, can't get no credit.

399
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,970
我回来后，罗斯也看到的
I come back here, Rose'll tell you,

400
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,770
我非常愤怒，想着有什么能做
madder than hell, trying to figure out what to do.

401
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,270
有人来敲门
Come a knock on the door.

402
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,540
我才住在这里三天，有谁知道我在这？
I ain't been living but three days, who know I'm here?

403
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,680
我去应门，原来是魔鬼
I open the door. Devil standing there.

404
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,650
一个大个子
Bigger than life.

405
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,710
一个白人，穿着得体
White fella, got on good clothes and everything.

406
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,250
手里拿着块剪贴板
Standing there with a clipboard in his hand.

407
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,240
我还没说什么
Now, I ain't got to say nothing.

408
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,450
他就说了：
First words come out of his mouth,

409
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,750
我知道你需要点家具而你不能贷款
I understand you need some furniture and can't get no credit.

410
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,490
我都要晕倒了，他说：我会让你贷款
I liked to fell over. He said, "I'll give you all the credit you want,

411
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,530
但你需要付利息
"but you gonna have to pay the interest on it."

412
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,260
我跟他说要是他给我那间寓所
Now, I told him, he give me them three rooms,

413
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,600
多少都行
he can charge whatever he want.

414
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,430
有辆货车第二天来了
Next day, a truck pull up here,

415
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,230
两个男人给那三间房间布置了家具
two men unload them three rooms.

416
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,430
驾车的那位给了我本书
Man what drove the truck give me a book.

417
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,970
跟我说每月初，寄十块到书上这个地址
Said first of the month, send $10 to the address in the book,

418
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,240
那就可以了
everything'll be fine.

419
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,270
说如果你没付
Said if you miss a payment,

420
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,440
魔鬼会来找你，而你需要付上更多
the devil was coming back, and there'll be hell to pay.

421
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,010
那是十五年前的事
That was 15 years ago.

422
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,620
直至今天，每月初，我都寄十块
To this day, first day of every month, I send my $10,

423
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,280
非常准时，罗斯可以担保
just like clockwork. Rose'll tell you.

424
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,520
特洛伊在说谎
Troy lying.

425
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,250
我从此没再见过那人
I ain't never seen that man since.

426
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,990
你说如果他不是魔鬼会是谁？
Now, you tell me, who else that gonna be but the devil?

427
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,320
而我没有卖掉灵魂什么的
And I ain't sold my soul or nothing like that.

428
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,790
我不会跟坐着货车来的魔鬼交易
No, I wouldn't have, truck with the devil over nothing like that.

429
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:11,600
但我却换来所有家具，所以我准时寄我的十块
But I got my furniture. And I send my $10, just like clockwork.

430
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,570
你都付多久了？
How long you say you been paying this $10 a month?

431
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,540
十五年
15 years.

432
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,500
天啊，那你不是一早付清了吗？
Hell, ain't you finished paying for it yet?

433
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,500
那人要你付多少？
How much the man done charge you?

434
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,040
是啊，我一早付清了
Oh, hell, I done paid for it.

435
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,710
早就付清了
I done paid for it 10 times over.

436
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,310
事实是，我怕我不继续付要承担后果
Fact is, I'm scared to stop paying.

437
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,650
别听特洛伊说的，家具是格利克曼先生的店买的
Troy lying. We got that furniture from Mr. Glickman.

438
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,510
他没有每月给谁十块
He ain't paying no $10 a month to nobody.

439
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,750
天啊，女人，博诺知道我不是傻的
Hell, woman, Bono know I ain't that big a fool.

440
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,350
我还想说
I was just getting ready to say,

441
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,520
我知道有个桥下卖便宜的家具
I know where there's a bridge for sale.

442
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,490
我告诉你
I'll tell you this.

443
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,520
那人是不是魔鬼不重要
It don't matter to me if it was the devil.

444
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,790
他有没有给我贷款也不重要
It don't matter if the devil give credit.

445
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,790
- 总有人要给我吧  - 那很重要
- Somebody got to give it.  - It ought to matter.

446
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,360
你到处说你跟魔鬼交易了
You walking around here saying you gonna make truck with the devil,

447
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,700
你将来得跟上帝解释清楚
god's the one you're gonna have to answer to.

448
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,500
祂会作出审判
He's the one gonna be at the judgment.

449
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
听着，爸，给我十块
Yeah, well, look here, pop, let me have that $10.

450
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,600
我会还你的
I'll give it back to you.

451
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,300
邦妮在医院找到工作了
Bonnie got a job working at the hospital.

452
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,270
博诺，我怎跟你说的？
Bono, what did I tell you?

453
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,040
只有这老兄有事相求时我才会见到他
Only time I see this nigger is when he want something.

454
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,310
只有那种时候
That's the only time I see him.

455
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,780
别说这，爸，博诺先生不想听这个
Come on, pop, Mr. Bono don't want to hear all that.

456
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,380
给我十块，我说过邦妮找到工作了吧
Let me have the $10. I told you, Bonnie's working!

457
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,150
她找到工作又如何了？
What that mean to me if Bonnie's working?

458
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,750
我不在乎，要是她在工作，你就去问她拿十块
I don't care if she working. Go ask her for $10 if she's working.

459
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,620
还说她在工作，那你为何不工作？
Talking about Bonnie working. Why ain't you working?

460
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,850
爸，你知道我不能找到正当工作
Ah, pop, you know I can't find no decent job.

461
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,320
我去哪找？你知道我的过去
Where am I gonna get a job at? You know I can't get no job.

462
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,530
我说过，我认识一些人
I told you, I know some people down there.

463
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,490
如果你想，我可以让你来清理垃圾
I can get you on the rubbish if you want to work.

464
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,400
你上次有事相求时我就跟你说了
I told you that last time you come back here asking for something.

465
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,630
不了，爸，谢谢，那不适合我
No, pop, thanks, that ain't for me.

466
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,400
我不想替人清理垃圾
I don't want to be carrying nobody's rubbish.

467
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,100
我不想做这些千篇一律的工作
I don't want to be punching nobody's time clock.

468
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,400
怎么了？清理垃圾配不起你吗？
What's the matter? You too good to carry people's rubbish?

469
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,340
你以为那十块是哪里来的？
Where you think that $10 you talking about comes from?

470
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,070
我就要去清理垃圾，然后我赚的就给你
I'm just supposed to haul people's rubbish

471
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,840
就因为你太懒惰？
and give my money to you 'cause you too lazy to work?

472
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,340
你不去工作
You're too lazy to work

473
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,810
然后想知道你为何没钱
and want to know why you ain't got what I got.

474
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,610
邦妮在哪间医院工作？慈善医院？
What hospital Bonnie working at, Mercy?

475
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,520
她在帕萨汶特医院里的洗衣房工作[匹兹堡医疗中心大学]
She down at Passavant, working in the laundry.

476
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,420
我不能给你，我给了你十块
I ain't got nothing as it is. I give you $10,

477
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,750
那我接下来一星期都吃豆吗？
I got to eat beans the rest of the week?

478
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,420
不，你不会拿到那十块
No, you ain't getting no $10 over here.

479
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,820
不至于吃豆吧
You ain't got to be eating no beans.

480
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,360
真不知道你为何能说出这？
I don't know why you want to say that?

481
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,960
我没有多余的钱！
I ain't got no extra money!

482
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,830
加布搬走了
Gabe done moved out,

483
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,660
钱都替珀尔小姐交房租了
giving his money over there to Miss Pearl, paying her rent.

484
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,640
我们都捉襟见肘了
Things done got tight around here.

485
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,570
我再也不能承担每次发薪金也给你
I can't afford to be giving you every payday.

486
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,770
我不是想你给我
I ain't asked you to give me nothing.

487
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,140
我是想你借给我
I asked you to loan me $10.

488
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,440
我知道你有十块的
I know you got $10.

489
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,610
我是有啊，你知道为何吗？
Yeah, I got it. You know why I got it?

490
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,840
因为我到处乱花钱
'Cause I don't throw my money away on them streets.

491
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,880
你想过得快活，当个音乐家
You want to live the fast life, being a musician,

492
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,710
有钱在俱乐部流连
running around in them clubs and things,

493
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,450
那就学懂照顾自己
then learn to take care of yourself.

494
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,580
你不会看到我请求别人帮忙
You ain't gone find me asking nobody for nothing!

495
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,820
这么都年来都没有
I spent too many years without.

496
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,850
你和我不同
Hey, you and me is two different people.

497
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,720
我吸取了教训，知道该做什么
I done learned my mistake and I learned to do what's right by it.

498
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,590
你还想不劳而获
You still trying to get something for nothing.

499
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,560
没人欠你什么
Life don't owe you nothing.

500
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,500
是你欠自己的，问问博诺，他也懂
You owe it to yourself. Ask Bono. He'll tell you I'm right.

501
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,870
我们有各自生活的方式
You got your way of dealing with the world, I got mine.

502
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,800
我唯一在乎的是音乐
Only thing that matters to me is the music.

503
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,400
看得出来，你吃什么不重要
Yeah, I can see that. Don't matter how you gonna eat,

504
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,700
哪来钱也不重要
don't matter where your next dollar coming from.

505
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,410
你说得真对
Yeah, you telling the truth there.

506
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,640
我知道我要吃饭，但我也要生活
I know I got to eat. But I got to live, too.

507
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,810
我需要点什么让我每天有动力
I need something that's gonna help me get out of bed in the morning,

508
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,610
让我感觉到我还存在
make me feel like I belong in the world.

509
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,490
我不打扰谁
I don't bother nobody.

510
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,390
我只是玩音乐而已
I just stay with my music

511
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,720
因为那是我生存于世的理由
'cause that's the only way I can find to live in the world.

512
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,520
不给就算了，别跟我说要做什么
Otherwise, ain't no telling what I might do.

513
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,620
我不是来批评你和你的生活方式
I don't come by criticizing you and how you live.

514
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,560
是让你借十块给我
I just come by to ask you for $10.

515
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,630
我不想听你说教
I don't want to hear all that about how I live.

516
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,160
天啊，你母亲把你养得真好
Boy, your mama did a hell of a job raising you.

517
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,870
爸，你改变不了我的，我已经三十四岁了
You can't change me, pop. I'm 34 years old.

518
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,130
如果你想改变我
If you wanted to change me,

519
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,770
或许你该在我成长时陪伴左右
you should have been there when I was growing up.

520
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,640
我来看你，向你借十块
I come by to see you, ask you for $10,

521
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,540
而你却跟我说我是如何被养育成人？
and you want to talk about how I was raised?

522
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,950
你根本不知道是怎么一回事
You don't know nothing about how I was raised.

523
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,920
给他十块吧，特洛伊
Let the boy have $10, Troy.

524
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,230
你在看什么？你知道我没有钱的
Hell you looking at? You know I ain't got no money.

525
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,200
你知道我把钱放在哪
You know what I do with my money.

526
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,000
给他吧，如果你想的话
Go on, give him $10 if you want him to have it.

527
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,600
我会，当你交给我的时候
I will, soon as you turn it loose.

528
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,470
这里
There it is.

529
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,610
七十六块二毛二
Seventy six dollars and twenty-two cents.

530
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,810
看到了吗，博诺？我只能拿回六块
You see this, Bono? I ain't gonna get but six of that back.

531
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,980
够了吧，拿着，里昂
He ought to stop telling that lie. Here, Lyons.

532
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,520
谢谢，罗斯
Thanks, Rose.

533
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,990
我要走了，下次见
Look, I got to run. I'll see you all later.

534
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,490
等下，你会说“谢谢，罗斯”
Wait a minute. You gonna say, "thanks, Rose,"

535
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,260
但你不感谢付出的那个
but you ain't gonna look to see where she got that money from.

536
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,560
你看到他们怎对待我吗，博诺？
You see how they do me, Bono?

537
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,560
我知道是你的钱，爸
I know she got it from you, pop.

538
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,120
谢谢，我会还的
Thanks. I'll give it back to you.

539
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,100
看，又撒谎了
There you go, telling another lie.

540
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,230
你还我十块时，你还欠着三十呢
Time I see that $10, you'll be owing me $30 more.

541
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,070
- 再见，博诺先生  - 保重，里昂
- See you, Mr. Bono.   - Take care, Lyons.

542
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,770
爸，谢谢，下次见
Thanks, pop. I'll see you again.

543
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,810
真不知道为何他不去工作
I don't know why that boy don't go and get him a decent job

544
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,780
然后照顾他的女人
and take care of that woman he got.

545
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,850
他会找的，特洛伊，那孩子还小
He'll be all right, Troy. The boy is still young!

546
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,690
那孩子三十四岁了
The boy is 34 years old.

547
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,720
别又开始说了
Let's not get off into all that.

548
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,720
我要走了，露西尔在等着我
Look here, I got to go. I got to be going. Lucille gonna be waiting.

549
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,020
看到这女人了吗，博诺？
See this woman, Bono?

550
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,860
我爱她
I love this woman.

551
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,530
我爱得都有点痛了
I love her so much, it hurts.

552
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:41,600
我太爱她，我都找不到方式表达了
I love her so much, I done run out of ways of loving her,

553
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,900
所以我要用回最简单的
so, I got to get back to basics.

554
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,740
你星期一早上别来
Don't you come by my house Monday morning,

555
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:46,710
跟我说要上班了
talking about time to go to work.

556
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,040
- 因为我还抚摸她  - 够了，特洛伊
- 'Cause I'm gonna still be stroking.  - Troy, stop!

557
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,880
我也不在意，罗斯
I ain't paying him no mind, Rose.

558
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,640
他只是醉了
That ain't nothing but gin talk.

559
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,750
即管吧，特洛伊！星期一见
Go on, Troy! I'll see you Monday.

560
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,020
你别来，朋友
Don't you come by my house, nigger!

561
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,920
我跟你说过我到时候在做什么
I done told you what I'm gonna be doing!

562
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,560
星期二才来
Come back on Tuesday!

563
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,930
早安
Good morning.

564
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,970
我可以给你煮早餐，你要吃吗？
You ready for breakfast? I can fix you some

565
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,370
在我挂起衣服后
soon as I finish hanging up these clothes.

566
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,340
我喝咖啡就行了
I got the coffee on. That's all right.

567
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,010
来点这个就行了
I just have some of that this morning.

568
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,680
昨天的彩票有结果了
That 651 hit yesterday.

569
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,620
珀尔小姐今个月第二次中了一块
That's the second time this month Miss Pearl hit for a dollar.

570
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,880
看来那些不需要的人总得到更多
Seems like those that need the least always get lucky.

571
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,440
贫穷的人反倒什么也没有
Poor folks can't get nothing.

572
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,020
数字又不认人的
Them numbers don't know nobody.

573
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,820
我不知道为你和里昂都玩这个
I don't know why you fool with 'em, you and Lyons both.

574
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,360
用来消闲
Oh, it's something to do.

575
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,830
你只不过在输钱而已
You ain't doing nothing but throwing your money away.

576
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,360
特洛伊，你知道我能控制自己
Troy, you know I don't play foolishly.

577
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,000
我就这里五分，那里五分的玩
I just play a nickel here and a nickel there.

578
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,730
那你就花了一毛了
That's two nickels you done throwed away.

579
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:22,370
不全是，我有时候会赢，那就扯平了
Nah, I hit sometimes. That makes up for it.

580
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,140
赢了的话，早晚会用到
Always comes in handy when I do hit.

581
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,940
赢的时候也不听见你抱怨
I don't hear you complaining then.

582
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,110
我不是在抱怨，我只是说这很愚蠢
I ain't complaining now. I just say it's foolish,

583
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,840
试着在六百种组合中
trying to guess out of 600 ways

584
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,410
猜出正确号码
which way the number gonna come.

585
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,040
如果我拿到这些黑人的…
If I had all the money these niggers...

586
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:39,750
非藉美国人一周放在上面的钱
You negroes throw away on numbers in one week,

587
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,720
只一星期，我就会很有钱
just one week, I'd be a rich man.

588
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,060
你在这里说如果和认为是件蠢事
You wishing and calling it foolish

589
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,860
那些人也不会停下不玩
ain't gonna stop folks from playing the numbers.

590
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,960
我肯定
That's one thing for sure.

591
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,100
再者，玩彩票也有好处的
Besides, some good things come from playing numbers.

592
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,400
看看蒲柏玩彩票
Look where Pope done bought him

593
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,130
让他赚了一间餐厅
that restaurant off of numbers.

594
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,800
我不能接受这种人
I can't stand niggers like that.

595
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,970
以前他没多少钱
Man ain't had two dimes to rub together.

596
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,810
穿着那双破鞋漫目无的地走
He running around with his shoes all run-over,

597
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,880
到处问人拿香烟
bumming money for cigarettes.

598
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,880
好了，中奖了
All right. Got lucky there, hit the numbers...

599
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,180
特洛伊，我也知道
Troy, I know all about it.

600
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,750
我会说他很有理智
Had good sense. I'll say that for him.

601
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,720
没把钱花光
Man ain't throw his money away.

602
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:15,020
我看过有人四天内用掉两千
I done see niggers go through $2,000 in four days.

603
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,760
他建了间餐厅
Man built him that restaurant down there.

604
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,120
看上去棒极了
Fix it up real nice, too.

605
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,090
然后他不让有些人进去
Then he won't let nobody come in it.

606
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,730
他们不服务黑人
Negro go in there, can't get no kind of service.

607
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:26,960
看到有个白人进去点了炖肉汤
Seen a white fella go in there, he orders a bowl of stew.

608
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,200
蒲柏从大锅里为他放了很多肉
Pope pick all the meat out of the pot for him.

609
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
那白人的炖肉汤都是肉
Man ain't had nothing but a bowl of meat!

610
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,900
黑人进去点同样的
Negro go in there behind him,

611
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,940
只会换来马铃薯和萝卜
he ain't got nothing but the potatoes and the carrots.

612
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,080
还说玩彩票能得到什么
Talking about what numbers do for people.

613
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,480
你举了个坏的例子
You picked the wrong example there.

614
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,780
那只让他成为一个更傻的傻子
Ain't done nothing but made a worser fool out of him

615
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,710
比以前傻得多了
than he already was before.

616
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,780
特洛伊
Troy.

617
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,050
你别再担心
You ought to stop worrying about

618
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,990
昨天工作时发生的事了
what happened at work yesterday.

619
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,720
我没在担心
I ain't worried.

620
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,160
他们只是叫我到理事长的办公室里
Just called me down there, the commissioner's office,

621
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,030
所有人都觉得我要被炒了
everybody's worried about them firing me.

622
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,970
我不担心
I ain't worrying about them firing me.

623
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,170
你也别担心了
You ain't got to worry about that.

624
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,340
科丽在家吗？
Where's Cory? Cory in the house?

625
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:12,040
- 科丽！ - 他出去了
- Cory!  - He gone out.

626
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,950
出去了是吧？他出去
Out, huh? Yeah, he going out

627
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,950
是因为知道我想他筑起那藩篱
'cause he know I want him to work on this fence.

628
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,950
我知道他害怕工作
I know how he is. That boy is scared of working.

629
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,150
他这辈子都没工作过
He ain't done a lick of work in his life.

630
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,850
他要去练习美式足球
He had to go to football practice.

631
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,960
教练想在赛季开始前
Coach wanted them to get in a little extra practice

632
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,160
多加练习
before the season start.

633
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,990
是啊，我知道他在做怎样
Oh, yeah, I got his practice all right.

634
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,260
还没完成家务就出去
Running out of here before he gets his chores done.

635
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,060
特洛伊，你怎么了？
Troy, what is wrong with you this morning?

636
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,030
什么事不合你意
Don't nothing set right with you.

637
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,800
回去睡足够才起来
Go on back in there, go to bed, and get up on the other side.

638
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,410
怎么是我有问题？
Why something got to be wrong with me?

639
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,240
我没说我有什么问题
I ain't said nothing wrong with me.

640
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,290
你对每件事都有意见
Well, you got something to say about everything.

641
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,540
首先是彩票，然后是那男人
First, it's the numbers, then it's the way the man

642
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,510
如何运作他的餐厅，然后是科丽的事
run his restaurant, then you done got on Cory.

643
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,110
下一样会是什么？
What's it gonna be next?

644
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,240
抬头看看天气合不合你意
Take a look up there, see if the weather suit you.

645
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,180
又或者抱怨你要在这
Or is it gonna be how you gonna put up this fence

646
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,250
挂满衣服的院子里筑起藩篱？
with the clothes hanging in the yard?

647
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,020
你说对了
You hit the nail on the head then.

648
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,120
当然，我这么了解你
I know you like I know the back of my hand.

649
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,090
进来再喝杯咖啡
Come on in here and get you some more coffee,

650
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,850
看看能不能让你正常点
see if that don't straighten you up.

651
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,360
因为你今早很不对劲
'Cause you ain't right this morning.

652
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:49,010
是特洛伊，嗨
There's Troy. Hey, Troy.

653
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,210
嗨，加布
Hey, Gabe.

654
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,050
- 嗨，罗斯  - 嗨，加布
- Hey, Rose.  - Hey, Gabe.

655
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,580
你拿着什么？
What you got there?

656
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:02,350
你想知道吗，罗斯？我有水果和蔬菜
You know what I got, Rose? I got fruits and vegetables.

657
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,290
你答应过给我的李子呢？
Where them plums you talking about?

658
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:08,090
我今天没有李子，我刚才正唱着关于那个
I ain't got no plums today. I was just singing that.

659
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:11,930
我明天会带来，我订了很多李子
I'll have some tomorrow. I put me in a big order for plums.

660
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:17,100
多到够分给圣彼得和所有人
I'll have enough plums tomorrow for Saint Peter and everybody!

661
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,270
特洛伊在生我的气
Troy mad at me.

662
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,070
加布，我没有，为何我要生气？
I ain't mad at you, Gabe. What I got to be mad at you about?

663
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,050
你又没对我做什么
You ain't done nothing to me.

664
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,650
我只是搬到了珀尔小姐那里
I just move over to Miss Pearl's to keep out from in your way.

665
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,080
我没什么打算
I ain't mean no harm by it.

666
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,620
谁说你有？
Who said anything about that?

667
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,220
我可没有说什么
I ain't said nothing about that.

668
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,120
你不生我的气吗？
You ain't mad at me, is you?

669
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,920
我没有，如果我有，你会知道的
I ain't made at you, Gabe. If I was mad at you, I'd tell you about it.

670
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:42,260
进来吧
Come on, get on out of the street. Come on.

671
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,030
我在地下室里有两间房，我拥有自己的门
I got me two rooms in the basement. I got my own door, too.

672
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,440
你想看我的钥匙吗？
You want to seemy key?

673
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:57,910
那是我的钥匙，没有人有同一样的
That's my own key. Ain't nobody else got a key like that.

674
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,640
那就是我两间房间的钥匙
That's my key for my two rooms.

675
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,680
很好，你有一把属于你的钥匙
That's good, Gabe. Got your own key, that's good.

676
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,650
你饿吗？
You hungry, Gabe?

677
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,680
我刚在给特洛伊煮早餐
I was just fixing to cook Troy some breakfast.

678
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,050
我吃点饼干就好了
I'll take some biscuits.

679
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,390
你有饼干吗？
Ooh, you got some biscuits?

680
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,260
你知道我在天堂时
Did you know, when I was in heaven,

681
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,260
我和圣彼得每早
every morning, me and Saint Peter

682
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,230
都会坐在门口，吃点饼干吗？
would sit down by the gate and eat some big, fat biscuits?

683
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,330
那时候真棒
Oh, yeah, we had us a good time.

684
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,700
我们就坐着，然后吃回饼干
We'd sit there and eat us them biscuits.

685
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,340
然后圣彼得会去睡一会
And then Saint Peter would go off to sleep,

686
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,140
叫我到审判的时候
and tell me to wake him up

687
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,340
叫醒他
when it's time to open the gates for the judgment.

688
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:33,080
进来吧，我会一大堆饼干给你
Well, come on, I'll make you a big batch of biscuits.

689
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,080
特洛伊，我看到圣彼得的名册上有你的名字
Hey, Troy. Saint Peter got your name in his book. I seen it.

690
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,180
写着特洛伊·马克森
It say, "Troy Maxson."

691
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,150
我跟他说：我认识他
I say, "i know him.

692
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:44,420
我们有同样的姓[马克森]
He got the same name like what I got.

693
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,490
那是我的兄长
"That's my brother."

694
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,290
你要跟我说多少次这故事？
How many times you gonna tell me that, Gabe?

695
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,360
名册上没有我的名字，不会有的
Ain't got my name in the book. Don't have to have my name.

696
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,730
我死过了，也到过天堂
I done died and went to heaven.

697
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,970
但他有你的名字
But he got your name, though.

698
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:02,270
一天早上，圣彼得在看他的名册
One morning, Saint Peter was looking at his book,

699
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,080
他在准备审判的到来
and he was marking it up for the judgment,

700
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,180
他让我看了你的名字
and he let me see your name.

701
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,110
在“M”的那一类别下
He got it in there under "M."

702
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,150
也有罗斯的名字
He got Rose's name.

703
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:15,420
我没有亲眼看到，但我知道的
I ain't seen it like I seen yours, but I know it's in there.

704
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,190
他有本很大的名册
He got a great big book! Whoo!

705
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,060
上面有所有存在过的人的名字
He got everybody's name what was ever been born.

706
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,290
他亲口告诉我的
That's what he told me.

707
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:27,230
但我亲眼看到你的名字
But I seen your name. I seen it with my own eye.

708
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,200
进去吧
Come in the house.

709
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,770
罗斯会煮点什么给你吃
Rose gonna fix you something to eat now.

710
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:32,300
我不饿，我吃了早餐了
I ain't hungry. I done had breakfast

711
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,340
和杰迈玛姨姨吃
with Aunt Jemima!

712
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,480
她过来，为我煮了很多烙饼
She come by, cook me up a whole mess of flapjacks!

713
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,340
好了，进去吧，罗斯会…
All right. Come on, let's go in the house. Rose fix us...

714
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,050
还记得我们以前怎么吃烙饼吗？
Remember how we used to eat them flapjacks?

715
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,210
记得，进来吧
Yes, I remember. Come on now.

716
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,350
- 我要走了  - 加布！
- I got to go!  - Gabe!

717
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,120
- 我要走了  - 加布，进来吧
- I got to go!  - Gabe, come on now!

718
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,050
我要去卖李子
I got to go sell my plums!

719
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,090
我卖了点蕃茄
I done sold some tomatoes.

720
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,060
赚了五角，想看吗？
Got me two quarters. Want to see?

721
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,560
我要储起来买个新喇叭
I'm gonna save 'em and buy me a new horn,

722
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:00,500
好让到审判时，圣彼得能听到
so Saint Peter can hear me when it's time to open the gate.

723
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,200
你听到吗？
You hear that?

724
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,270
是地狱之犬
You hear that? That's the hellhound.

725
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,110
我要把它们赶走
I'm gonna chase them out of here.

726
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:13,140
走啊！别来这！
Go on! Get out of here! Get out! Get out!

727
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,140
[诗歌]

728
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:13,100
加布在哪？
Where's Gabe?

729
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,110
他又到处跑了
He's gone off somewhere.

730
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,240
他没有好好吃饭
He ain't eating right.

731
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,610
珀尔小姐说他不肯吃
Miss Pearl say she can't get him to eat nothing.

732
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,180
你想我怎样？
What you want me to do about it, Rose?

733
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,880
我为他做了我能做的事
I did everything I could for the man.

734
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,550
我不能让他康复
I can't make him get well.

735
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:28,850
打仗时他被伤及脑袋了，你想他怎样？
Man got half his head blown off, what you expect?

736
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,590
有些事还是能为他做的
Seems like something ought to be done to help him.

737
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,190
他也不打扰谁
The man don't bother nobody.

738
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,460
因为他的脑袋里有块金属碎片
He just mixed up 'cause of that metal plate

739
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,330
所以他才疯疯癫癫，没理由…
he got in his head. Ain't no sense in...

740
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,430
谢谢，没理由让他住在医院
Thank you. Ain't no sense in sending him to the hospital.

741
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,630
至少他会吃点什么
At least he'd be eating right.

742
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,330
他们会照顾他
They could help him take care of himself.

743
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,900
没有人想被锁起来
Don't nobody want to be locked up, Rose.

744
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,900
你为何想锁起他？
What you want to lock the man up for?

745
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,540
他上战场
Man going down there,

746
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:52,910
跟日本人打仗
over there and fight that war, messing with them japs,

747
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,580
炸伤了脑袋
getting half his head blown off.

748
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,450
他们随便赔了三千块，我都接受了
They give him a lousy $3,000. I got to swoop down on that.

749
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,880
你又要说这个了吗？
Is you fixing to get into that again?

750
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,150
他的脑袋里有块金属碎片
He got a metal plate in his head.

751
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,220
而那就是我得到这间房子的原因
That's the only reason I got a roof over my head

752
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,660
就因为那金属碎片
is 'cause of that metal plate.

753
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,590
你没理由自责的
Ain't no sense in you blaming yourself for nothing.

754
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,930
他不能管理好那笔钱
Gabe was in no condition to manage that money.

755
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,900
你为他做了正确的事
You done what was right by him.

756
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,330
没人能说你不是
Can't nobody say you ain't done what was right by him.

757
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,300
看看你照顾他多久了
Look how long you took care of him.

758
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:17,470
一直至到他想要有自己的地方，才搬去珀尔小姐那
Till he wanted his own place and moved over there with Miss Pearl.

759
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:20,200
女人，那不是我想说的，我只是…
That ain't what I'm saying, woman. I'm just...

760
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,210
我只是在说事实
I'm just stating the facts.

761
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,310
要是我的弟弟没有受伤
If my brother didn't have a metal plate in his head,

762
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,650
我就不会有上厕所的地方
I wouldn't have a pot to piss in

763
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,310
不会有个后院
or a window to throw it out of.

764
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,220
我都五十三岁了…
And I'm 53...

765
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,530
你要去哪？
Where you going off to?

766
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,400
你近期每个星期六都出去
You been running out of here every Saturday for weeks.

767
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,330
我以为你会筑起那藩篱
I thought you were gonna work on this fence.

768
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:50,200
我去泰勒的酒吧里
I'm gonna go down to Taylors' and, uh...

769
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,720
妈妈？
Mama?

770
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,290
科丽，你爸爸对你今早还没完成家务
Oh, Cory. Your daddy like to have a fit with you

771
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:47,020
就跑出去非常愤怒
running out of here this morning without doing your chores.

772
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,000
你还好吗？
You all right?

773
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,730
他说你本该帮忙筑起藩篱
He say you supposed to be helping him with the fence.

774
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,400
我说过要去练习啊
I told you I had to go to practice.

775
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,430
他过去几个星期六都这样说
And he's been saying that the last four or five Saturdays,

776
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:58,540
然后就跑到泰勒的酒吧
and then don't ever do nothing but go down to Taylors'.

777
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,010
你有跟他说录取的事吗？
You told him about the recruiter?

778
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,570
有
Yeah, I told him.

779
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,740
- 那他怎么说？ - 他没说什么
- Well, what'd he say?  - He didn't say nothing too much.

780
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,580
在他回来前快完成家务
Go on and get started on your chores before he gets back here.

781
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,350
在他回来又要抱怨前
Go on and scrub down them steps

782
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:13,350
快去刷刷地板
before he come back here hollering and carrying on!

783
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,320
现在啊，小子
Go! Boy, go!

784
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:41,050
继续吧，特洛伊，你早晚会把我吓死的
Go on, Troy. You liked to scare me to death.

785
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,220
比赛怎么了？
What was the score of the game?

786
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,380
露西尔在电话说过，但我没留意
Lucille had me on the phone. I couldn't keep up with it.

787
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,780
我为何在意比赛了？来吧，女人
What do I care about the game? Come here, woman.

788
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,250
我以为你去泰勒那里
I thought you went down to Taylors'

789
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,790
就是为了看比赛，让我走
to listen to the game. Go on, Troy.

790
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,720
我以为你要筑起那藩篱
I thought you're supposed to be putting up the fence.

791
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,320
我会去的，在我处理好…
I'll put it up when I finish with what...

792
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,530
我手上的事
Is at hand.

793
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:57,700
快去吧，真不懂你的
Go on, Troy. I ain't studying you!

794
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,730
但我懂你，我会好好的弄清楚你
I'm studying you. I'm finna do my homework.

795
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,600
够了
Troy, you better leave me alone!

796
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,740
科丽回来了吗？
Where Cory? That boy brought his butt home yet?

797
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,410
他在上面做家务
He's upstairs doing his chores.

798
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:09,640
科丽，快下来…
Cory, get your butt...

799
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,410
- 你去哪？ - 很快会来
- Where you going?  - I'll be right back.

800
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:15,880
- 何时？ - 就街口那
- When?  - I'm just going right down the street.

801
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:19,820
去哪？跟谁？
Where? Who?

802
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,320
特洛伊，进去吧
Troy, go in the house.

803
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,150
你到现在才回来吗？
You just now coming here from leaving this morning?

804
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,750
- 对，我要去练习  - 对什么？
- Yeah, I had to go to football practice...  - Yeah, what?

805
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,730
对，先生
Yes, sir.

806
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,520
我才不看你一会
I ain't but two seconds off you, no way.

807
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,160
那垃圾箱都要满了
That garbage sitting in there, overflowing.

808
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,560
你没做过家务
You ain't done none of your chores.

809
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,590
现在也没礼貌
Now you come in here, talking about, "yeah."

810
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,460
我刚想做，爸
I was just getting ready to do my chores now, pop.

811
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,700
你的首要是星期六帮我筑起藩篱
Your first chore is to help me with this fence on Saturday.

812
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,470
所有事都放在那之后
Everything else come after that.

813
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,770
去拿木锯，我们要锯开这些木板
Now, get that saw, we gonna cut these boards.

814
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,870
嘿，爸
Hey, pop.

815
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,780
你为何不买电视？
Why don't you buy a TV?

816
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,480
我要来做什么？
What I want with a TV? What I want one of them for?

817
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,450
现在每人家里都有一台
Everybody got one. Earl, Ba Bra, Jesse.

818
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,620
我不是在问谁有电视，我是问要来做什么？
I ain't asked who had one, I said what I want with one?

819
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,950
所以你可以看啊，现在有很多不同的节目
So, you can watch it. They got lots of things on TV.

820
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,520
- 棒球也有  - 是吗？
- Baseball and everything.  - Yeah?

821
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,750
我们可以看世界大赛
We could watch the world series.

822
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,820
- 那买电视要多少钱？ - 我不清楚
- Yeah, how much this TV cost?  - I don't know.

823
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,630
我看见过优惠价二百块
They got 'em on sale for about $200.

824
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,460
- 二百块？ - 那不算贵，爸
- $200?  - That ain't that much, pop.

825
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,860
是啊，才二百块而已
No, that's just $200.

826
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,000
你有留意那屋顶吗？
You see that roof you got sitting over your head at night?

827
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,470
我来告诉你那屋顶的事
Let me tell you something about that roof.

828
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:49,440
那屋顶已经十年没涂上焦油了
It's been 10 years since that roof was last tarred.

829
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,910
然后到了冬天下雪时
See, now snow come this winter,

830
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,580
雪积聚在屋顶上
sit up on that roof like it is,

831
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,610
然后一点点的慢慢地渗透到里面
it's gonna seep inside, just gonna be a little bit,

832
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,750
你甚至不会注意到
you ain't gonna hardly notice it,

833
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,820
然后当你发现时
then next thing you know,

834
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,580
早已渗透到各处
it's gonna be leaking all over the house.

835
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,650
然后因为积水，木材会腐蚀
Then the wood rot from all that water,

836
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,650
到时候你就需要把整个屋顶换掉
and you gonna need a whole new roof.

837
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,790
你猜要多少才能修好？
Now how much you think it cost to get that roof fixed?

838
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,990
- 我不知道  - 两百六十四块现金，明白了吗？
- I don't know.  - $264 cash money. See?

839
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,860
当你在想买电视
While you be thinking about a TV,

840
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,600
我就得担心头上的屋顶
I got to be thinking about the roof

841
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,200
又或是要修理的东西
or whatever else go wrong around here.

842
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,200
如果你有二百块，你会怎做？
Now if you had $200, what would you do?

843
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,670
修理屋顶还是买电视？
Fix the roof, or buy a TV?

844
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,010
买电视，当屋顶开始渗水时
I'd buy a TV. And when the roof started to leak,

845
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,610
我才修理它
if it needed fixing, I'd fix it.

846
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,910
你哪来的钱？
Where you gonna get your money from?

847
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:25,680
你都花在买电视上了
You done spent it on a TV.

848
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,480
到时候你在里面
You gonna sit up in there,

849
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,810
看着漏水滴到你的新电视上吗？
let that water run all over your brand-new TV?

850
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,580
爸，我知道你有钱的
Pop, you got the money. I know you do.

851
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,250
- 在哪？ - 银行里
- Where I got it at, huh?  - In the bank.

852
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,520
你想看我的存摺吗？
You want to see my bank book?

853
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:37,620
你想看我那七十三块二毛二的存款吗？
You want to see that $73.22 I got sitting up in there?

854
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,260
你不需要一次付清
You don't have to pay for it all at one time.

855
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,230
可以先给首期，之后分期付款
You can put a down payment on it, and carry it on with you.

856
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,930
除非情况紧急，我才不会让自己欠别人东西
Not me. I ain't owing nobody nothing if I can help it.

857
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:46,700
迟了付款，他们就会来带走它
Miss a payment, they come and snatch it right out of your house.

858
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,800
那你就白付了，明白了吗？
Then what you got, huh? See?

859
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,540
如果我有整整两百块，我会选择买电视
Now, when I get $200 clear, I'll buy me a TV.

860
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,840
要是我手上有两百六十四块，我就会选择修理屋顶
Right now, when I get $264, I'm gonna get that roof fixed.

861
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,910
爸…
Oh, pop...

862
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,510
如果你想买电视
You go get you $200

863
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,740
就自己赚两百块
and buy you a TV if you want to.

864
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,550
我的钱要花在更实用的地方
I got better things to do with my money.

865
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,780
我赚不到两百，我甚至没见过两百
I can't get $200. I ain't never seen $200.

866
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,520
好吧，我跟你说
All right, I'll tell you what.

867
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,720
我们各人付一百
You get $100, I'll put the other $100 with it.

868
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:10,990
好吧，等着我
All right, I'm gonna show you.

869
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,660
现在给我看你如何切开这些木板
Yeah, show me how you can cut these boards right now.

870
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,790
拿着，那值两百块
There you go. That's $200 worth.

871
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,370
- 匹兹堡海盗队今天赢了  - 是吗？
- The Pirates won today.  - Yeah?

872
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,040
连续赢五场了
That makes five in a row.

873
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,870
我没在意海盗队，他们都只有白人球员
I ain't thinking about no Pirates. They got an all-white team.

874
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:29,740
他们有个波多黎各的球员，克莱门特是吧？
Got that boy, though, that Puerto Rican boy, Clemente?

875
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,870
也不让他出出场
Don't even half play him.

876
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,780
如果给那孩子机会，他会是位伟大的球员
That boy could be something if they'd give him a chance.

877
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:35,280
让他上一天场，隔天又坐板凳了
Play him one day, sit him on the bench the next.

878
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,850
他也常上场啊
He gets lots of chances to play.

879
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,620
我在说每天都上场，当正选
I'm talking about playing every day, playing regular,

880
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,280
这才能学到更多啊
so you can get your timing, that's what I'm talking about.

881
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,590
他们队里也有些白人不是每天都能上场
They got some white guys on the team that don't play every day.

882
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,960
你总不能让全部人上场
You can't play everybody at the same time.

883
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,760
如果有个白人球员是当后备的
If they got a white fellow sitting on the bench,

884
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,330
你可以肯定他根本不会打棒球
you can bet your last dollar he can't play.

885
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,630
有色人种要出色两倍才能当正选
Colored guy got to be twice as good to get on the team.

886
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:53,330
那就是我不想你进球队的原因
That's why I don't want you getting all tied up in them sports.

887
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,630
进去了又如何？
Man on the team, what it get him?

888
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,630
球队的有色人种不被重用
Got colored on the team, don't even use him.

889
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,340
如同没有他们一样，所有球队都是这样的
Same as not having them. All them teams the same.

890
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,770
亚特兰大勇士队也有汉克·阿伦和韦斯·科文顿
The Braves got Hank Aaron and Wes Covington.

891
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,880
汉克·阿伦已经有四十三个全垒打了，算上今天两个的话
Hank Aaron hit two home runs today. That makes 43.

892
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,880
亚伦不算什么，那是你该做的
Aaron ain't nobody. That's what you supposed to do.

893
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,780
你该全力以赴
That's how the game's supposed to be played.

894
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,080
没别的，不过是
Ain't nothing to it. It's a matter of getting

895
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,680
抓准时机然后挥棒
your timing and follow through.

896
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,820
我现在也可以打四十三个全垒打
Hell, I can hit 43 home runs right now.

897
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,350
你不能在美国职业棒球大联盟里打得出来
Not off no Major-League pitcher, you couldn't.

898
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,950
我们在黑人联盟里有更强的投手
We had better pitching in the negro leagues.

899
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,890
我在萨奇·佩吉身上打过七次全垒打
I hit seven home runs off of Satchel Paige.

900
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,260
你不会找到比他更好的球员
You can't get no better than that.

901
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,930
山迪·柯法斯，他是联盟里三振次数最多的
Sandy Koufax, he leading the league in strikeouts.

902
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,660
我不是在想山迪·柯法斯的事
I ain't thinking about no Sandy Koufax.

903
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,330
还有华伦·史潘和卢·伯德特，我猜你…
You got Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette. I bet you...

904
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,760
我不想再说了
I'm through with it now.

905
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,170
去锯木板吧
Go and cut them boards.

906
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,810
你妈妈跟我说你被大学美式足球队录取了
Your mama told me you got recruited by a college football team.

907
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,110
真有此事吗？
Is that right?

908
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,680
对，泽尔曼教练说
Yeah, coach Zellman say

909
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,680
晚点会有负责人跟你商讨
the recruiter gonna be coming by to talk to you.

910
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,780
让你签同意书
Get you to sign the permission papers.

911
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,350
我以为你会在A&P里工作
I thought you was supposed to be working down the A&P.

912
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,020
你放学后不是应该到那里工作吗？
Ain't you supposed to be working down there after school?

913
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,920
斯塔维茨基先生说他会替我留着位子
Mr. Stawicki say he gonna hold my job for me

914
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,690
直到赛季结束
until after the football season.

915
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:55,030
他说下周起，我可以只上周末的班
He said starting next week, I can work weekends.

916
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:58,030
小子，我以为我们说好了
Boy, I thought we had an understanding about this football stuff.

917
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,900
你应该继续完成家务
You supposed to keep up with your chores,

918
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,830
继续在A&P工作
hold your job down there at the A&P.

919
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:04,000
你今天大半天不在
You ain't been around here all day on a Saturday,

920
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,370
也没完成家务
ain't none of your chores done.

921
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:07,100
现在你说你辞职了？
Now you come telling me you done quit your job?

922
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,170
- 我周末也会上班啊  - 当然了
- I'm gonna be working weekends.  - You damn right you are!

923
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,110
那负责人也不必到来
And ain't no need for nobody to be coming around here,

924
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,640
跟我说签署的事
talking to me about signing nothing.

925
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,720
爸，你不能这样做
Pop, you can't do that.

926
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:14,980
他大老远从北卡罗莱纳州来
He's coming all the way from north Carolina.

927
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,950
我才不在乎
I don't care where he coming from!

928
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,120
听着，小子
Look, boy,

929
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,820
那些白人无论如何也不会让你
the white man ain't gonna let you

930
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,750
碰美式足球的
get nowhere with no football no way.

931
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,120
你继续你的学业，所以你可以…
Now you get your book-learning, so you can, uh,

932
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,130
在A&P有进升的机会，还有学习维修车子
work your way up at the A&P and learn how to fix cars,

933
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,990
或者建筑，让自己有一技傍身
or build houses, get you a trade.

934
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,730
那样你才有竞争力
This way, you got something can't nobody take away from you.

935
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:35,070
你的双手
You go in and learn how to put your hands to good use

936
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:37,030
该做比清理垃圾更好的工作
besides hauling other people's garbage.

937
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,210
我的成绩很好，爸
I get good grades, pop.

938
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,770
那就是他们会跟你商讨的原因
That's why the recruiter want to talk with you.

939
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,200
你的成绩也要好才能被录取的
You got to keep up your grades to get recruited.

940
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:43,140
这样我就有机会上大学
This way, I'll be going to college, I'll get a chance.

941
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,880
首先，你去A&P那拿回你的工作
First, you get your butt down there and get your job back.

942
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,180
斯塔维茨基先生已经聘请了其他人
Mr. Stawicki done already hired somebody else

943
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,910
因为我跟他说我要打美式足球
'cause I told him I was playing football.

944
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,180
我比我想像中还蠢
You a bigger fool than I thought.

945
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,420
你竟然让别人代替了你的位置
You gonna let somebody take away your job,

946
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,890
好让你能打什么美式足球
so you can play some football.

947
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,760
你上哪赚钱
Where you gonna get your money

948
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,090
照顾你的女友什么的？
to take care of your girlfriend and whatnot?

949
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:01,760
到底有多蠢
What kind of foolishness is that

950
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,060
才会让别人代替了自己？
to let somebody take away your job?

951
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,460
我周末还是会去工作的
I'm still gonna be working weekends.

952
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,760
不，你去找另一份工作
No. You getting out of here and finding you another job.

953
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,940
别这样，爸，我还得练习呢
Come on, pop. I gotta practice.

954
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,900
我不能同时工作和练习
I can't work after school and play football, too.

955
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,440
泽尔曼教练说球队需要我
The team needs me, that's what Coach Zellman say.

956
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,770
我才不介意他说什么，我说了算，明白了吗？
I don't care what nobody say. I'm the boss. You understand?

957
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:17,010
我是你的父亲，我说的才算
I'm the boss around here. I do the only saying what counts.

958
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,480
- 别这样…  - 我问你：你明白了吗？
- Come on...  - I asked you, "do you understand?"

959
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,480
- 明白  - 什么？
- Yeah.  - What?

960
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,820
- 明白，先生  - 好了
- Yes, sir.  - All right.

961
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:29,060
你去A&P看看能不能取回你的工作
You get on down there to that A&P and see if you can get your job back.

962
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,490
如果只能二选其一，那就放弃进球队吧
If you can't do both, then you quit the football team.

963
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:33,790
人生不如意事十常八九
You got to take the crookeds with the straights.

964
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:34,990
明白，先生
Yes, sir.

965
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,030
我可以问你点事吗？
Can I ask you a question?

966
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,800
你又要问什么？
What the hell you got to ask me?

967
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,510
你该问斯塔维茨基先生工作的事
Mr. Stawicki the one you got the questions for.

968
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,110
你为何从不喜欢我？
How come you ain't never liked me?

969
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:55,750
喜欢你？谁说我一定要喜欢你？
Like you? Who the hell said I got to like you?

970
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:59,150
有什么规定要我一定要喜欢你？
What law is there say I got to like you?

971
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,520
既然站在我面前
You want to stand up in front of my face

972
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,250
问这蠢极了的问题
and ask a damn fool-ass question like that.

973
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,820
还扯什么喜欢谁
Talk about liking somebody.

974
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,120
说话时站近点，小子
Come here, boy, when I talk to you.

975
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:12,000
该死的，站好，我问你
Straighten up, god damn it! I asked you a question.

976
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,030
- 有什么规定要我一定要喜欢你？ - 没有
- What law is there say I got to like you?  - None.

977
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:17,100
正是，你三餐温饱吗？
All right, then. Don't you eat every day?

978
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,970
我问你问题时，你就得回答我
Answer me when I talk to you.

979
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,040
- 你三餐温饱吗？ - 对
- Don't you eat every day?  - Yeah.

980
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,910
小子，你一天在我的地方
Nigger, as long as you in my house,

981
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,980
你就得加在句子最后加上“先生”
you put a "Sir" on the end of it when you talk to me.

982
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,280
- 是，先生  - 你每天都有饭吃？
- Yes, sir.  - You eat every day?

983
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,880
- 是，先生  - 有地方住？
- Yes, sir.  - Got a roof over your head?

984
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,050
- 是，先生  - 有衣服穿？
- Yes, sir.  - Got clothes on your back?

985
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,850
- 是，先生  - 原因呢？
- Yes, sir.  - Why you think that is?

986
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:32,980
- 全因为你  - 我当然知道是因为我
- 'Cause of you.  - Hell, I know it's 'cause of me.

987
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,250
但你认为是因为什么？
But why do you think that is?

988
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,290
因为你喜欢我？
'Cause you like me?

989
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,290
“喜欢”你
"Like" you.

990
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,260
我每天一大清早出去工作
I go out of here every morning,

991
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,860
还得时时刻刻忍受那些白人[crackers带侮辱之意]
I bust my butt putting up with them crackers every day

992
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,530
才算得上“喜欢”你
'cause I "like" you.

993
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:50,830
你简直是我见过最愚蠢的人，那是我的职责
You about the biggest fool I ever saw. It's my job.

994
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,570
我的责任
It's my responsibility.

995
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:55,570
一个男人就该照顾他的家庭
A man is supposed to take care of his family.

996
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:58,540
你住在我的房子里，吃我买回来的食物
You live in my house, fill your belly with my food,

997
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:02,180
我照顾你是因为你是我的儿子啊
put your behind on my bed because you're my son.

998
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:05,120
而不是我喜欢你，照顾你是我的职责
Not 'cause I like you. 'Cause it's my duty to take care of you.

999
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,880
我得承担起这个责任
I owe a responsibility to you.

1000
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,890
现在我就说清楚
Now, let's get this straight right here and now,

1001
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,290
以免你将来又说同样的话
before it go along any further.

1002
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,990
我不需要喜欢你
I ain't got to like you.

1003
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:16,130
兰德先生每星期发薪给我不是因为他喜欢我
Mr. Rand don't give me my money come payday 'cause he like me.

1004
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:19,230
是因为他欠我的
He give it to me 'cause he owe me.

1005
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,300
现在我已给了所有我该给你的
Now I done give you everything I got to give you.

1006
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,870
我把你带到这个世界上啊！
I give you your life!

1007
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,800
你妈妈和我都商讨好各自的职责
Me and your mama worked that out between us,

1008
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,610
而喜欢你不是我的工作之一
and liking your black ass wasn't part of the bargain.

1009
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,780
你从今起别再
Now don't you go through life

1010
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:32,310
担心别人是否喜欢你
worrying about whether somebody like you, or not.

1011
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:35,580
你该想他们没有负了你
You best be making sure they're doing right by you.

1012
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:36,950
- 明白了吗？ - 明白，先生
- You understand what I'm saying?  - Yes, sir.

1013
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:40,980
那现在滚开，去A&P拿回你的工作
Then get the hell out of my face and get on down to that A&P!

1014
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,640
你为何就不让那孩子打美式足球呢，特洛伊？
Why don't you go ahead and let the boy play football, Troy?

1015
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,650
他只想像你一样在运动有点成就
He just want to be like you with the sports.

1016
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,950
我不想他重蹈覆辙
I don't want him to be like me.

1017
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,380
我想他走条和我完全不同的路
I want him to get as far away from my life

1018
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:13,550
越不同越好
as he possibly can get.

1019
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,020
你是我生命中唯一遇过的好事，罗斯
You the only decent thing ever happened to me, Rose.

1020
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:17,990
我希望他找个像你一样好的女人
And I wish him that.

1021
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:21,420
除此之外我不希望他像我一样
But I don't wish him nothing else from my life.

1022
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,030
我在他出生的那天就决定
I decided 17 years ago,

1023
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:26,400
那孩子不要参与什么运动
that boy wasn't gonna get involved in no sports.

1024
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,200
在我明白运动里的不公之后
Not after what they did to me in the sports.

1025
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,400
你为何就不承认你当时不能进职业联盟是因为年纪？
Why don't you just admit you were too old for the Major Leagues?

1026
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,200
就承认一次？
For once, why don't you just admit that?

1027
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,040
别跟我来年纪这套
Don't you come tellin' me I was too old.

1028
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,270
是因为我是有色人种而已，我现在都五十三岁了
I just wasn't the right color. Hell, I'm 53 years old,

1029
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,380
但我肯定我能打出比“S”的点二六九更好的成绩
I can do better than Selkirk's .269 right now.

1030
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,010
过了四十岁还怎样打棒球？
How were you gonna play ball when you were over 40?

1031
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,650
有时候你说的话真不合逻辑
Sometimes, I can't get no sense out of you.

1032
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,820
我很清醒，女人
I got good sense, woman.

1033
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:49,190
我清楚知道别让运动伤了他的身心
I got sense enough not to let that boy get hurt playing no sports.

1034
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:50,950
你太疼爱他了
You mothering the boy too much.

1035
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,120
让他老是担心别人是否喜欢自己
Worrying about whether people "like" him or not.

1036
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:56,290
那孩子做的所有事，都是为了给你看
Everything that boy do, he do for you.

1037
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,100
他想你称赞他，仅此而已
He wants you to say, "good job, son." That's all.

1038
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,430
罗斯，我没时间做这些事，他好好的活着
I ain't got time for that, Rose. He's alive, he's healthy.

1039
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:06,100
就得自己找出路，我也得继续自己的生活
He's got to make his own way. I made mine.

1040
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,270
他将来出社会后
Ain't nobody gonna hold his hand

1041
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,670
没有人会时常照顾他的
when he get out there in the world.

1042
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:11,140
特洛伊，时代不同了
Times have changed, Troy.

1043
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,240
人会变的
People change.

1044
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,480
世界在变，而你根本不知道
The world changing, and you can't even see it.

1045
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,020
女人，我尽我所能地工作
Woman, I do the best I can do.

1046
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,290
每星期五我带着
I come in here every Friday,

1047
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:29,230
一袋马铃薯和一桶猪油回来
I carry a sack of potatoes and a bucket of lard.

1048
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:33,030
你们才得以不用工作
You all line up at the door with your hands out.

1049
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:34,730
我连最后的钱都用在你们身上
I give you the lint from my pockets.

1050
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:36,470
我付出了我的血汗
I give you my sweat and my blood.

1051
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:39,270
我无法给你们同情，早已用光了
I ain't got no tears. I done spent them.

1052
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:42,070
我们晚上到楼上做爱
We go upstairs in that room at night, I fall down on you

1053
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:45,440
在你里面给了我唯一所剩的
and try to blast a hole into forever.

1054
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,040
星期一早上起来，带着桌上煮好的午餐
I get up Monday morning, find my lunch on the table,

1055
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:49,310
出去继续我的生活
go out and make my way.

1056
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:53,720
试着捱到星期五
Find my strength to get me through to next Friday.

1057
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,250
那就是我能给的，罗斯
That's all I got, Rose.

1058
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:01,190
那已经是我能给你们的全部了
That's all I got to give.

1059
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,030
已经没什么可以再给你们了！
Can't give nothing else!

1060
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,160
马克森先生？
Mr. Maxson?

1061
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,300
理事长想见你
Commissioner will see you now.

1062
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,410
罗斯
Rose!

1063
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:53,110
嘿，罗！
Hey, Ro!

1064
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:57,410
我真想看到兰德先生当时的糗样
I wish I could've seen Mr. Rand's face when he told you.

1065
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,350
他听了判决后都说不出话来了
He couldn't get it out his mouth. Liked to bit his tongue.

1066
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:02,350
当他们叫我到理事长的办公室时
When they called me down there to the commissioner's office,

1067
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:05,260
兰德像所有人一样都以为他们要炒了我
he thought they was gonna fire me, like everybody else.

1068
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,090
我可没有这样想
Oh, I didn't think they was gonna fire you.

1069
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:09,430
我以为他们要给你警告信
I thought they's gonna put you on the warning paper.

1070
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:12,830
嘿，罗斯！对，兰德先生这下一定无话可说了
Hey, Rose! Yeah, Mr. Rand liked to bit his tongue.

1071
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:15,130
我看到你跑到泰勒的酒吧
I see you run right down there to Taylors'

1072
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:16,400
告诉那个叫艾伯塔的女子
and told that Alberta gal.

1073
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,470
嘿，罗斯！我跟所有人都会说的，嘿，罗！
Hey, Rose! I told everybody. Hey, Ro!

1074
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:21,500
我去那兑现支票[花钱]
I went down there to cash my check.

1075
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,370
嘿！
Hey!

1076
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:25,380
别叫了，我知道你回来了
Hush all that hollering. I know you out here.

1077
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,280
理事长怎说了？
What they say down at the commissioner's office?

1078
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,210
我叫你的时候你就该立刻回应我，女人
You supposed to come when I call you, woman.

1079
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:30,380
博诺也懂
Bono will tell you that.

1080
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,120
你叫露西尔时她不也立刻回应吗？
Don't Lucille come when you call her?

1081
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,650
闭嘴吧老兄，我又不是狗
Man, hush your mouth. I ain't no dog.

1082
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,420
说什么立刻回应你
Talk about come when you call me.

1083
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:36,290
博诺，看到了吗？我以前有只狗
You hear this, Bono? I used to have me an old dog

1084
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,460
也像这样自以为高人一等
get uppity like that.

1085
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:40,160
你喊他来，他也不理会
You say, "come here, Blue,"he just lay there, look at you.

1086
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,360
最后通常都是被追着打，为了教训他
End up getting a stick chasin' him away, trying to make him come.

1087
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,860
我不在意你和你的狗
I ain't studying you and your dog.

1088
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,600
我记得你总会唱起歌来
I remember you used to sing that old song.

1089
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:51,700
没有人想听啊
Nobody wants to hear that old song.

1090
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,370
他唱起来时，总让科丽到处跑
Used to have Cory runnin' around here singin' that song.

1091
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:58,170
我也记得那首歌
Hell, I remember that song myself.

1092
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,370
那是我爸爸的歌
That's my daddy's song.

1093
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,190
他创作的
My daddy made up that song.

1094
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,350
我才不在乎谁作的，没有人想听你唱的
I don't care who made it up. Don't nobody want to hear you sing it.

1095
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:13,620
你这么兴奋回来，我就猜到他们没有炒了你
You come in here carrying on, I reckon they ain't fired you.

1096
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,630
理事长到底说了什么？
What they say down there at the commissioner's office?

1097
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:18,900
罗斯，听着，兰德先生在理事长会见我后
Look here, Rose. Mr. Rand called me in his office

1098
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,460
叫我到他的办公室
after I got back from talkin' to them people down there.

1099
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:24,130
他叫我进去并说
He called me in his office and told me...

1100
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,170
他们要让我当司机！
They was making me a driver!

1101
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:30,510
- 特洛伊，你在说笑吧！ - 不信问博诺
- Troy, you kidding!  - No, I ain't. Ask Bono.

1102
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:31,640
那真好，特洛伊
That's great, Troy.

1103
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,340
那你再不用跟那些人纠缠了
Now you don't have to hassle them people no more.

1104
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,450
天啊，没想到今天你会来
Oh, hell. I didn't think I was gonna see you today.

1105
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,620
我以为你在监狱里
I thought you was in jail.

1106
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:40,480
听到消息说他们扫荡西佛的店
Got it all over the courier about them raiding Seefus' place

1107
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:43,220
那个你跟那些不伦不类的家伙经常去的地方
where you be hanging out with all them thugs.

1108
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,890
嘿，爸，那跟我没关系
Hey, pop, that ain't got nothing to do with me.

1109
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,060
我没在那赌博
I don't go down there gambling.

1110
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:48,220
我只是去那跟乐队交流
I just go down there to sit in with the band.

1111
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:50,360
那赌博跟我沾不上关系
I ain't got nothing to do with the gambling part.

1112
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,900
他们那里有些很好的音乐人
They got some good music down there.

1113
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,630
那里只有流氓而已
They got some rogues is what they got.

1114
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:55,670
博诺先生你还好吗？你好，罗斯
How you been, Mr. Bono? Hi, Rose.

1115
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:58,540
我知道你今晚在克劳佛烧烤店有演出[爵士乐俱乐部]
I see where you playing down at the Crawford Grill tonight.

1116
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,240
你怎么又不带邦妮来？
How come you ain't brought Bonnie like I told you?

1117
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,340
你该带上她来
You shoulda brought Bonnie.

1118
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:02,570
她很久没来过了
She ain't been by in a month of Sundays.

1119
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:03,910
我刚巧路过而已
I was just in the neighborhood.

1120
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:05,440
- 想着见你们一面  - 又来了
- Thought I'd stop by.  - Here it comes.

1121
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,640
你爸爸升职了
Your daddy got a promotion on the rubbish.

1122
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:10,250
他是第一个驾驶垃圾车的有色人种
He gonna be the first colored driver.

1123
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:11,480
什么也不用做
Ain't got to do nothin' but sit up there

1124
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,180
像白人一样坐着看报纸就行了
and read the paper, like them white fellas.

1125
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,690
爸，如果你识字的话，那会是件好事
Hey, pop, if you knew how to read, you'd be all right.

1126
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:18,420
不不，你指如果这老兄懂得驾驶的话
Nah, nah. You mean if the nigger knew how to drive,

1127
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,560
那才是件好事
he'd be all right.

1128
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:22,090
一直跟那些人争论驾车的问题
Been fighting with them people about driving

1129
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,330
然而连驾照也没有
and ain't even got a license.

1130
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:24,960
兰德先生知道你没有驾照的吧？
Mr. Rand know you ain't got no driver's license?

1131
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:26,130
驾车很容易
Driving ain't nothing.

1132
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,930
就是扭軚盘而已
All you do is point the truck where you want it to go.

1133
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,200
并不难
Driving ain't nothing.

1134
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:31,170
他们知道你没有驾照吗？
Do they know you ain't got no driver's license?

1135
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:32,470
那才是我问的
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1136
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,510
我不是问你驾驶是否容易
I ain't asked if driving was easy.

1137
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,670
我问你兰德先生是否知道你没有驾照一事
I asked if Mr. Rand know you ain't got no driver's license.

1138
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:36,940
那人没必要知道我的事
The man ain't got to know my business.

1139
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:39,280
待他发现时我已经有两三个驾照了
Time he find out, I have two or three of them driver's license.

1140
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,280
- 听着，爸  - 我就知道你会这么说
- Say, look here, pop.  - I knew it was coming.

1141
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,280
我知道你要说什么
I knew what kinda "look here, pop" that was.

1142
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,650
那小子又要问我拿钱了
Nigger finna ask me for some money.

1143
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:46,520
今天是星期五，又是我的发薪日
It's Friday night, it's my payday.

1144
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,290
那些没被拘捕的流氓会在林荫大道流连
All them rogues down on the Avenue, the ones that ain't in jail,

1145
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:52,960
里昂赶着去跟他们会合
and Lyons is hopping in his shoes to get down there with them.

1146
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,030
听着，爸
Now, see, pop,

1147
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,590
如果你让别人说完他要说的
if you gave somebody else a chance to talk sometime,

1148
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,400
你就会知道我要还你答应过的十块
you'd see I was fixing to pay you back your $10 like I told you.

1149
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,530
拿着，我说过待邦妮发薪了我会还你的
Here. I told you I'd pay you when Bonnie got paid.

1150
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,740
不，你自己留着那十块，存到银行里
No, you keep that $10. Put it in the bank.

1151
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,540
下次你觉得又要来这里向我拿钱时
Next time you feel like you wanna come by here

1152
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,370
你就从银行拿出这十块
and ask me for somethin', you go down there and get that.

1153
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:11,310
拿着属于你的十块吧，爸
Here you go your $10, pop.

1154
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:12,640
我说过我不想你给我
I told you, I don't want you to give me nothing.

1155
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:13,810
我只想借而已
I just wanted to borrow $10.

1156
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,710
不，你留着下次用
No, you keep that for the next time you want to ask me.

1157
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,350
别这样，爸，拿着吧
Come on, pop, here go your $10.

1158
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:21,480
特洛伊，你为何不让那孩子还钱？
Troy, why don't you let the boy pay you back?

1159
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,720
你替他拿吧，罗斯，如果你不拿
Here you go, Rose. If you don't take it,

1160
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,730
接下来六个月他又要不断唠叨此事了
I'm gonna hear about it for the next six months.

1161
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:30,560
你也可以顺道给出你的那份薪金，特洛伊
You can hand yours over, too, Troy.

1162
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,330
博诺，你看到他们怎对待我了吗
You see this, Bono? You see how they do me?

1163
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:34,030
看到，露西尔也是这样做
Yeah, Lucille do me the same way.

1164
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:45,340
嘿，是特洛伊的儿子啊
Hey. Hey, there's Troy's boy!

1165
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,640
加布叔叔，你最近好吗？
How you doing, Uncle Gabe?

1166
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,410
里昂
Lyons!

1167
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:52,580
万兽之王
The king of the jungle!

1168
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:55,750
嘿，罗斯，我有朵玫瑰花给你
Rose. Hey, Rose, I got a flower for you.

1169
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:58,450
我亲自摘的，就跟你名字一样的玫瑰
I picked it myself. That's the same rose like you is.

1170
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,060
你真有心，加布
Aw, that's right nice of you, Gabe.

1171
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:01,660
加布叔叔，你最近在做什么？
What you been doing, Uncle Gabe?

1172
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:05,400
噢，我一直在追赶地狱之犬
Oh, I been chasing hellhounds and waiting for the time

1173
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,360
并等着告诉圣彼得打开天堂的门
to tell Saint Peter to open the gates.

1174
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:08,800
你在追赶地狱之犬？
You been chasing hellhounds, huh?

1175
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,700
你做得很正确
Well, you doing the right thing, Uncle Gabe.

1176
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:13,770
- 总有人要去赶走他们  - 是的，我也知道
- Somebody's got to chase 'em.  - Oh, yeah, I know it.

1177
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:16,740
魔鬼很强大，不是那么容易打败
The devil's strong. The devil ain't no pushover.

1178
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:19,380
地狱之犬一直在寻找人类的气息[应为sniff，非snip]
Hellhounds snipping at everybody's heels.

1179
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:22,050
但我已经准备好喇叭，等待审判日的来临
But I got my trumpet waiting on the judgment time.

1180
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:23,750
为了哈米吉多顿之战作准备吗？[圣经中世界末日最后一战]
Waiting on the Battle of Armageddon, huh?

1181
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,820
噢，那眨眼就会结束
Oh, ain't gonna be too much of a battle

1182
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:29,550
当上帝挥动审判之剑时
when god get to waving that judgment sword.

1183
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,650
如果天堂的门关上的话，那时候人们就得费时
But the people's gonna have a hell of a time

1184
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:34,420
等待进入天堂了
trying to get into heaven if them gates ain't open.

1185
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:35,790
你听到这吗，爸？
You hear this, pop?

1186
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:37,590
加布叔叔，你人真好
Uncle Gabe, you all right.

1187
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,660
里昂
Lyons.

1188
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:42,870
万兽之王
The king of the jungle!

1189
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:44,300
加布，你留下来吃晚餐吗？
You stayin' for supper, Gabe?

1190
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:45,370
你要我煮你的份吗？
You want me to fix you a plate?

1191
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,500
我要份三明治就好了，不用煮我的份
I'll just take a sandwich, Rose. I don't want no plate.

1192
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:50,610
我喜欢用双手拿着来吃，三明治好了
I want to eat with my hands. I'll take a sandwich.

1193
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:53,080
你呢里昂？留下吗？在煮牛小排呢
What about you, Lyons? You stayin'? Got some short ribs cooking.

1194
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:56,650
不了，我通常在演出完结后才用餐的
Nah. I won't eat nothing till after we finish playing.

1195
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,420
你应该来看看我演出，爸
You ought to come down, listen to me play, pop.

1196
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,650
噢，我不喜欢那些像中国音乐一样的嘈音
Oh, I don't like all that Chinese music, all that noise.

1197
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:05,120
去洗手吧，加布，我现在弄三明治
Go in there and wash up, Gabe. I'll fix you a sandwich.

1198
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,820
特洛伊在生我的气
Troy mad at me.

1199
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:09,430
你为何生他的气？
What you mad at Uncle Gabe for?

1200
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:10,560
他以为特洛伊为了
He think Troy mad at him

1201
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,430
他搬到珀尔那里而生气
'cause he moved over there to Miss Pearl's.

1202
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:14,530
我才没有生气，他可以住他想住的地方
I ain't mad at the man. He can live where he want to live at.

1203
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,700
他为何搬到那里？珀尔小姐任何人都不喜欢
Well, what he move over there for? Miss Pearl don't like nobody.

1204
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,570
噢，她不介意他在，还对他颇好
Oh, she don't mind him none. She treat him real nice.

1205
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,740
她就不允许他唱歌而已
She just don't allow all that singing.

1206
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:22,670
她不介意他在为她付租金，仅此而已
She don't mind that rent he be paying. That's what she don't mind.

1207
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:24,440
特洛伊，我不想再跟你讨论此事
Troy, I ain't goin' through that with you no more.

1208
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,140
他搬到那因为他想要有自己的地方
He moved over there 'cause he wanted his own place.

1209
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:27,310
他可以随他所想的做
He can come and go as he please.

1210
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,580
他可以在这里做他想做的，我也不介意
He can come and go as he please here. I wasn't stoppin' him.

1211
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:30,780
我也没规定他什么
I wasn't putting no rules on the man.

1212
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,620
你明知道那是两码子的事
That ain't the same thing, and you know it.

1213
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:34,590
我不想再讨论这话题
Now that's the last I wanna hear about that.

1214
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,450
我不想再听到加布和珀尔小姐之间的事
I don't wanna hear nothin' else about Gabe and Miss Pearl.

1215
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:37,490
还有下周…
And next week...

1216
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:39,320
我准备好了，罗斯
I'm ready for my sandwich, Rose.

1217
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,420
还有下周，当从学校来的负责人到来
And next week, when that recruiter come from that school,

1218
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:43,890
我要你签署让科丽进美式足球队
I want you to sign that paper and go on and let Cory play football.

1219
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,800
我不想再听你说起此事
That'll be the last I have to hear about that.

1220
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:52,600
科丽被录取了？他要到哪所学校？
Cory got recruited? What school he goin' to?

1221
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,170
我不想再理会科丽的事
I ain't thinking about Cory nothing.

1222
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:56,570
那小子把这里当成他的地方
Boy walking around here smelling his piss,

1223
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:57,910
以为可以为所欲为
thinking he gonna do what he want to do,

1224
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:00,480
不听我的说话
irregardless of what I say.

1225
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,710
博诺，听着，我离开理事长的办公室后
Look here, Bono, I left the commissioner's office

1226
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:04,180
去了A&P那里
and went down to the A&P.

1227
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:06,620
那小子根本没在那工作，他跟我说谎了
That boy ain't workin' down there, he lied to me.

1228
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:09,890
说他取回了工作，周末得上班什么的
Tellin' me he got his job back, tellin' me he workin' weekend,

1229
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:11,620
说他课后在上班
tellin' me he workin' after school.

1230
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,820
斯塔维茨基说他根本没来上班
Mr. Stawicki says he ain't working down there at all.

1231
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,000
科丽只是长大了而已
Cory just growing up.

1232
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:17,490
他有了自己的想法，不能再听你说的
He just bustin' at the seams, tryin' to fill out your shoes.

1233
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:18,670
我才不在意他想什么
I don't care what he doing.

1234
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,760
当他到了反叛期
When he get to the place where he want to disobey me,

1235
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:23,900
那就是出外打拼的时候了，博诺也懂
then it's time for him to move on. Bono will tell you that.

1236
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,740
我肯定他不能违抗他父亲后
I bet he ain't never disobeyed his daddy

1237
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,770
不用受罚
without paying the consequences.

1238
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,940
我根本没机会违抗他
I ain't never had the chance.

1239
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:33,780
我父亲到处走，我根本没看过他
My daddy came on through, but I ain't never knew him to see him.

1240
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:36,580
或者他在想什么，去哪了
Or what he had on his mind, or where he went.

1241
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:40,450
就四海为家，寻找新大陆
Just moving on through. Searching out the new land.

1242
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,550
那就是以前的人用的
That's what the old folks used to call it.

1243
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,890
一个人要是到处搬，不停换女人
See a fella moving around from place to place, woman to woman,

1244
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:49,560
他们叫这“寻找新大陆”
they call it "searching out the new land."

1245
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,030
我也不清楚他有没有找到
I can't say if he ever found it.

1246
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,560
我来到这地方，也不想有孩子
I come along, didn't want no kids.

1247
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,830
我也不知道我能否安定下来
I didn't know if I was gonna be in one place long enough

1248
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,900
当个爸爸
to fix on 'em right as their daddy.

1249
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,200
我想不如还是寻找新大陆算了
I figured I was going searching, too.

1250
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:03,570
没想过我跟露西尔在一起的时间
As it turn out, I been hooked up with Lucille

1251
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,910
也几乎有你爸爸和罗斯在一起那么久了
for near about as long as your daddy been with Rose.

1252
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:08,210
已经十六年了
Going on 16 years.

1253
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:09,980
有时候我真希望自己不认识我的父亲
Sometimes, I wish I'd never known my daddy.

1254
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:13,950
他不在意孩子过得怎样，对他来说毫不重要
He ain't cared nothing about no kids. A kid to him wasn't nothing.

1255
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:17,650
他只想你快点成人
All he wanted you to do was learn how to walk,

1256
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:18,830
好让你能去工作赚钱给他
so he could start you to working.

1257
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:23,030
吃饭时，他总先吃，你只吃他剩下的
Come to eating, he ate first. Anything left over, that's what you got.

1258
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:26,500
他会吃掉所有东西，而你只分到那么一点
Man would sit down, eat two chickens, and give you the wing.

1259
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,700
爸，别胡说了，天下父母都会让子女吃饱
You ought to stop that, pop. Everybody feed their kids.

1260
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,840
不管时势有多艰难，天下父母都疼爱子女
No matter how hard times is, everybody care about their kids.

1261
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,040
确保他们三餐温饱
Make sure they have something to eat.

1262
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,940
我父亲唯一在意的
Only thing my daddy cared about

1263
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,810
就是叫我们搬那一卷卷的棉花给鲁宾先生
was getting them bales of cotton in to Mr. Lubin.

1264
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:39,910
那是他唯一在意的事
That's the only thing that mattered to him.

1265
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:42,250
以前我都在想他为何还活着
Sometimes, I used to wonder why he was still living,

1266
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,950
为何魔鬼还没带走他
why the devil hadn't come and got him.

1267
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:46,950
快把棉花搬到鲁宾先生那
"Get them bales of cotton in to Mr. Lubin."

1268
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:48,580
后来才知道我父亲欠鲁宾钱
Find out he owe him money.

1269
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:49,720
当他知道此地不宜久留时
He should have just went on and left

1270
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,750
他就该跑路
when he saw he couldn't get nowhere.

1271
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:51,930
至少我会那样做
That's what I would've done.

1272
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,860
他怎留下十一个孩子就走？还有走去哪？
How he gonna leave with 11 kids? And where he gonna go?

1273
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:57,990
他只懂耕作，他根本无路可逃
He ain't knew nothing but how to farm. No, he was trapped.

1274
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,730
我想他也知道，但我也会为他说一句…
I think he knew it, too. But I'll say this for him...

1275
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:03,630
他觉得他有责任照顾我们
He felt a responsibility toward us.

1276
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,700
虽然不像我预期一样体贴
May not have treated us like I felt he should have,

1277
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,670
但他要是没有良心
but without that responsibility,

1278
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:09,710
大可以留下我们，自己跑路
he could have run off and left us,

1279
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:10,970
再另起炉灶
made his own way.

1280
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,610
很多人也这样
A lot of them did.

1281
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:14,040
你说你父亲的那一代吗？
Back in those days, what you talkin' about?

1282
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,880
他们每天离开房子
They walk out their front door

1283
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,080
无论多日晒雨淋，都在街上一直走
and take off down one road or another and just keep on walkin'.

1284
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,080
对，这才像话
There you go. That's what I'm talkin' about.

1285
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:24,720
一直走到他们遇到下一间房子
Just keep on walking till they come to something else.

1286
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,990
你没听过大迁徙吗？[一战时黑人从美国南部迁北]
Ain't you never heard of nobody having the walking blues?

1287
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:30,760
那就是你叫那些跑路的人
Now, that's what you call it when you just take off like that.

1288
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:34,660
我父亲不是你说的那种
My daddy ain't had no walking blues. What you talking about?

1289
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:36,030
他留下来了
He stayed right there with his family,

1290
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,900
但他坏事做尽
but he was just as evil as he could be!

1291
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:44,740
我妈妈接受不了他和他的性格
My mama couldn't stand him. Couldn't stand that evilness.

1292
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,780
我八岁时她就离开了
She run off when I was about eight.

1293
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:50,910
她有一晚静悄悄的走，跟我说她会回来
She sneaked off one night, told me she was coming back for me.

1294
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,780
自那我就再没有见过她
I ain't never seen her no more.

1295
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:56,950
他有过的女人终究都会离开他，他不是个好人
All his women run off and left him. He wasn't good for nobody.

1296
00:54:57,590 --> 00:54:59,060
轮到我离家的时候
My turn come to head out.

1297
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,660
我当时十四岁
I was 14,

1298
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:03,660
跟乔·康纳尔的女儿打得火热
got to sniffing around Joe Canewell's daughter.

1299
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:07,100
我们家有只老骡子叫“灰色男孩”
We had this old mule called "Greyboy".

1300
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,630
我父亲叫我出去耕作
My daddy sent me out to do some plowing.

1301
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:13,100
让我有机会跟乔·康纳尔的女儿谈谈情
I got to fooling around with Joe Canewell's daughter.

1302
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:16,670
我们找到了一个隐蔽的地方抚摸大家
Found us a nice spot, got real cozy with each other.

1303
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:19,840
她当时十三岁，所以我们都知道大家发育了
She was about 13, so we done figured we grown anyway.

1304
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,110
我们在溪河附近，互相抚摸
So, we were down there by the creek, enjoying ourselves,

1305
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,810
把正事都放一边
ain't thinking about nothing.

1306
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,080
怎料绑着“灰色男孩”的绳子松开了
Didn't know Greyboy had gotten loose,

1307
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:29,750
它跑回家里，我父亲就知道事有蹊跷
wandered back to the house, and my daddy was lookin' for me.

1308
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:33,620
他找到我们时，看到我们还在抚摸大家
So, we down there enjoying ourselves when he come up on us.

1309
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,730
我们不知所措
Surprised us.

1310
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:38,130
他拿着骡子身上的皮带
Had them leather straps off that mule,

1311
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:41,360
开始不停地打我
commenced to whupping me like there was no tomorrow.

1312
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:44,030
我站起来，当时心感侮辱又愤怒
I jump up. I'm mad, embarrassed.

1313
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,970
又很害怕他
I was scared of my daddy.

1314
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:49,010
他开始打我时
Now, when he commenced to whipping on me,

1315
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:50,870
很自然地我就逃跑吧
quite naturally, I run to get out of the way.

1316
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,710
我想他是因为我没有完成工作而生气
Now, I think he's mad 'cause I ain't done my work.

1317
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:56,150
但我看到他故意让我落跑
But I see where he's chasing me off,

1318
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:58,180
然后想去独占这个女孩
so he can have the gal for himself.

1319
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:01,920
当我想透了
When I see what the matter of it was,

1320
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:06,990
我变得不再害怕他，自那，我成为了一个男人
I lost all fear of my daddy, and right there, I became a man.

1321
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:09,660
才十四岁
Fourteen years of age.

1322
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,660
是时候轮到我作主了
Now, it's my turn to run him off.

1323
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,400
我拿起他刚才用的皮带
I picked up them same reins he used on me.

1324
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,030
然后开始打起他来
I picked up them reins, I commenced to whupping on him.

1325
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,270
那女孩落荒而逃
Gal jump up, she run off.

1326
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,710
当他转过来看着我时
When he turned to face me,

1327
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:26,680
我终于知道为何魔鬼没有带走他
I knew why the devil never come and get him

1328
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,840
因为他就是魔鬼
'cause he was the devil himself.

1329
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:32,750
我忘了之后发生什么了
I don't know what happened.

1330
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:35,950
我醒过来，躺在溪河旁
I woke up, laying there by the creek,

1331
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:39,790
我们养的老狗布卢，它在舔我的脸
and Blue, this old dog we had, he was licking my face.

1332
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:42,890
我的双眼肿极了
Both my eyes were swoll shut.

1333
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:44,830
我以为我瞎了，什么都看不到
I thought I was blind, I couldn't see nothing.

1334
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:48,700
就躺在那里哭
I just laid there and cried.

1335
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,010
我也不知道该怎办
And I didn't know what I was gonna do.

1336
00:56:57,010 --> 00:57:01,710
但我知道是时候离家出走了
But I knew the time had come for me to leave my daddy's house.

1337
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:05,110
突然间我感觉到世界之大
Suddenly, the world got big, and...

1338
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:12,120
费了我很多时间才弄清楚
It was a long time before I could cut it down to where I could handle it.

1339
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:16,790
弄清楚的期间，我发现
Part of that cutting down was where I got to the place

1340
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:18,830
其实他在我心底下，在怒吼着想出来
where I could feel him kicking in my blood,

1341
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:20,230
而我和他之所以不同
and I knew the only thing that separated us

1342
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:22,770
只是我们不是生于同一个时代而已
was a matter of a few years.

1343
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,000
加布叔叔，你在吃什么？
What you got there, Uncle Gabe?

1344
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:29,470
我在吃火腿三明治
I got me a ham sandwich.

1345
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:31,840
罗斯给我弄了火腿三明治
Rose gave me a ham sandwich.

1346
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,250
除了加布里埃尔外，我没再联系家里的人
I lost touch with everybody except Gabriel.

1347
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:42,250
但…
But...

1348
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,920
我希望他已经死了
I hope he's dead.

1349
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:54,860
我希望他能找到点安慰
I hope he found some peace.

1350
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:57,030
真是个沉重的故事，爸
That's a heavy story, pop.

1351
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:02,100
我都不知道你十四岁就离家了
I didn't know you left home when you was 14.

1352
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:04,170
十四岁太早独立了
Fourteen's kinda young to be on your own.

1353
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,180
要是我的话真不知道该怎办
I don't know what I would've done.

1354
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:09,850
我在那溪河站了起来，向莫比尔出发
Well, I got up from that creek, walked on down to Mobile.

1355
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:13,520
我不想再耕作了，我想我在城市会找到更好的工作
I was through with farming. I figured I'd do better in the cities.

1356
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,320
所以我徒步走了两百英里到莫比尔
So, I walked the 200 miles to Mobile.

1357
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,990
等下，你才没有徒步走两百英里，爸
Wait a minute, you ain't walked no 200 miles, pop.

1358
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,190
没有人想这样做
Ain't nobody gonna walk no 200 miles.

1359
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:23,230
那是段很长的距离啊！
You talking about some walking there!

1360
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:26,100
以前唯一到其他地方的方法就是徒步
That's the only way you got anywhere back in them days.

1361
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:29,060
妈的，我会选择搭便车
Shit! Damn if I wouldn't have hitched a ride with somebody.

1362
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:30,870
哪来的便车？
Who you gonna hitch it with?

1363
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:32,840
那时候才没有现在的车和科技
There ain't no cars and things like they got now.

1364
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,270
当时是一九一八年
We talking about 1918.

1365
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:36,070
你们在这里聊什么？
What you all out here gettin' into?

1366
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:38,240
我跟里昂说他现时的生活比以前好多了
I'm telling Lyons how good he got it.

1367
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,840
他根本不知道我在说什么
He don't know nothing about this I'm talking.

1368
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,140
里昂，刚才邦妮打来了
Lyons, that was Bonnie on the phone.

1369
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:42,550
她说你约好了去接她下班
She says you supposed to pick her up.

1370
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:44,280
知道了，罗斯
Yeah, okay, Rose.

1371
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:47,120
我到了莫比尔
I walked on down to Mobile,

1372
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,550
搭了驶向这边来的人便车
hitched up with some fellows that was coming up this way.

1373
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,190
到了才发现
Got up here and found out,

1374
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:53,960
不但找不到工作
not only could you not get a job,

1375
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,360
也找不到住处
you couldn't find no place to live.

1376
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,290
我以为自己自由了
I thought I was in freedom.

1377
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,960
有色人种都住在里弗班克[加州城市]
Colored folks living down there on the Riverbanks

1378
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:03,170
随便哪里都好
in whatever kind of shelter they could find for themselves.

1379
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:05,900
有些在桥下睡
Right down there under the Brady Street Bridge.

1380
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:09,370
有些在自己用木条和沥青纸搭建的帐篷睡
Living down there in shacks made out of sticks and tar paper.

1381
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:12,210
那时候我都要崩溃了
Messed around down there.

1382
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:14,940
无恶不作，开始偷窃
Went from bad to worse. Started stealing.

1383
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:17,350
开始时是食物，然后我想到偷钱
First, it was food. Then I figure I steal me some money,

1384
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:20,120
可以买食物，鞋等
I can buy me some food, buy me some shoes, too.

1385
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:22,180
一样接一样，最后遇见你的妈妈
One thing led to another. Met your mama.

1386
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:24,990
当时还小，急着想成为个男人
I was young, anxious to be a man.

1387
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,960
我遇到你妈妈后有了你，怎办了？
I met your mama and had you. Why'd I do that for?

1388
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,260
我得多养两人
Now, I got to worry about feeding you and her.

1389
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:32,030
得要偷更多才行
Got to steal three times as much.

1390
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:36,170
我有一天在外面，想着对谁下手
I went out one day looking for somebody to rob.

1391
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:37,430
对，我当时是个小偷
That's what I was, I was a robber.

1392
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:39,970
我不会隐瞒
I'mma tell you the truth.

1393
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:42,000
直至今天我还是心感惭愧，但那是事实
I'm ashamed of it today, but it's the truth.

1394
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:44,940
我找到目标，掏出了我的小刀
I went to rob this fella, I pull out my knife.

1395
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:47,080
他拿出了枪，想也不想就射在我胸口上
He pulled out a gun, shot me in the chest.

1396
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,240
那感觉
It felt like somebody had taken

1397
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:50,280
就像有人拿着灼热的铁块烙印在我身上
a hot branding iron and laid it on me.

1398
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,350
他射了我之后，我跳上前以小刀还击
Now, when he shot me, I jumped at him with my knife,

1399
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:57,220
他们说我杀了他
and they say I killed him.

1400
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:59,290
让我坐了十五年监牢
Locked me up, put me in the penitentiary for 15 years.

1401
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:00,960
我在里面认识了博诺
That's where I met Bono.

1402
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:03,630
学会了打棒球
Where I learned how to play baseball.

1403
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:05,230
出来后才发现你妈妈带走了你
Got out that place, and your mama had taken you,

1404
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:07,260
在一个没有我的环境下继续生活
went on to make a life without me.

1405
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,370
十五年是段很长的时间
Fifteen years was a long time for her to wait.

1406
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:12,370
但那十五年让我改正了
But that 15 years cured me of that robbing stuff.

1407
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:13,000
罗斯会告诉你
Rose'll tell you.

1408
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,240
我再遇到她时，她问我
I first met her, she ask me if I had

1409
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,370
是否已经将那无知改掉了
gotten all that foolishness out of my system.

1410
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,310
我说：宝目，只剩你和棒球
I said, "baby, it's you and baseball,

1411
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:21,210
对我来说是重要的，听到吗，博诺？
"all what count to me." You hear me, Bono?

1412
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:24,010
而我也真的那样想，她说：哪样较重要？
And I meant it, too. She said, "which one come first?"

1413
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:27,120
我说：当然是棒球
I said, "well, ain't no doubt it's baseball.

1414
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:29,150
但要是你留下来和我白头到老
"But you stick and get old with me,

1415
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:30,920
我们的爱会比对棒球的爱更长寿
"and we'll both outlive this baseball."

1416
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,060
我说对了吗，罗斯？
Am I right, Rose?

1417
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:35,690
那是真的
And it's true.

1418
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,320
老兄，闭嘴吧，你才没有说过
Man, hush your mouth. You ain't say no such thing.

1419
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:39,700
你当时说“宝贝你知道你永远都是最重要的”
Talkin' about, "baby, you know you'll always be number one with me."

1420
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:42,330
那才是你所说的
That's what you was talking.

1421
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:44,300
那就是为何我那么爱这个女人
That's why I love this woman.

1422
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:45,670
罗斯总会提醒你
Rose will keep you straight.

1423
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,200
如果你误入歧途，她总会提醒你
You get off the track, she'll straighten you up.

1424
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,870
里昂，你快点去接邦妮
Lyons, you better get on up and get Bonnie.

1425
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:50,110
她在等你呢
She waiting on you.

1426
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,180
- 嘿，爸  - 什么？
- Hey, pop.  - Yeah?

1427
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:54,540
你应该来看看我表演
You ought to come down to the grill, hear me play.

1428
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,110
老兄，我才不去
Oh, man, I ain't goin' down there.

1429
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:57,450
我太老了，不适合到俱乐部
I'm too old to be hanging out in them clubs.

1430
01:00:57,450 --> 01:01:01,020
你得很出色才能在[酒吧和]烤肉店演出
You got to be good to play down at the grill.

1431
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:02,420
来吧，爸
Come on, pop.

1432
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:03,950
我明天还得早起
I got to get up in the morning.

1433
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,320
你不用待到很晚
Well, you ain't gotta stay long.

1434
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:11,090
不了，我打算吃了晚餐就去睡
No, I'm gonna eat my supper and go to bed.

1435
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:15,100
那我走了，下次见
Well, I got to go. I'll see you later.

1436
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:20,970
你别在我的发薪日出现
Don't you come by my house on my payday!

1437
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:23,270
还有下次来先打电话，让别人知道
And pick up the phone, let somebody know you coming,

1438
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:25,310
也带上邦妮，你知道我很想见她
and bring Bonnie, you know I'm always glad to see her.

1439
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:29,040
好的，罗斯，保重
I'll do that, Rose. You take care now.

1440
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:30,410
- 下次见，爸  - 好吧
- See you, pop.   - All right.

1441
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:32,480
再见，博诺先生
See you, Mr. Bono.

1442
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,120
再见，加布叔叔
See you, Uncle Gabe!

1443
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,750
里昂！万兽之王！
Lyons! King of the jungle!

1444
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,450
晚餐好了吗，女人？
Supper ready, woman?

1445
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:39,990
我们有点事要做
Me and you got some business to take care of.

1446
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:42,220
- 我会让你爽翻天  - 特洛伊，我说过了
- I'mma tear it up, too.  - Troy, I done told you now!

1447
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:44,190
天啊，女人，是博诺而已，他就像家人一样
Oh, hell, woman, it's Bono. Bono like family.

1448
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,400
我已经认识这朋友…
I done know this nigger since...

1449
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,100
- 我认识你多久了？ - 很久了
- How long have I known you?  - It's been a long time.

1450
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,430
我自斯基还是小朋友的时候就认识这朋友[应为电影]
I done known this nigger since Skippy was a pup!

1451
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,370
经历了不少日子
Me and him done been through some times!

1452
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:55,200
你说对了
You sure are right about that.

1453
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:57,270
我认识他甚至比认识你还长，罗斯
Hell, I known him longer than I known you, Rose,

1454
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:59,210
至今我们还是好朋友
and we still standin' shoulder to shoulder.

1455
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:02,510
夫复何求啊博诺
Look here, Bono, a man can't ask for no more than that.

1456
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:04,080
我爱你，朋友
I love you, nigger.

1457
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,080
天啊别来这套，我也爱你
Oh, hell! I love you, too.

1458
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:09,150
但我得回去，你在这里能见你的女人
But I got to get home, see my woman. You got yours in hand.

1459
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:11,050
我得回去才能见到她
I got to go get mine.

1460
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:14,730
你为何这样做，爸？
What you do that for, pop?

1461
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:16,760
科丽，什么事了？
What's the matter? Cory, what's the matter?

1462
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,130
爸到学校跟泽尔曼教练说
Pop done went up to the school and told Coach Zellman

1463
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:19,290
我不能继续打美式足球
I can't play football no more.

1464
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,060
也不让我比赛和练习
Wouldn't even let me play the game.

1465
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,430
他告诉教练叫球队负责人别来找他
Told him to tell the recruiter not to come.

1466
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:24,370
- 特洛伊  - 你叫我做什么？
- Troy.  - What you Troying me for?

1467
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:26,100
对，我的确做了，那小子知道原因
Yeah, I did it. And the boy knows why I did it.

1468
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:28,100
你为何要这样对我？那是我唯一的机会啊！
Why you wanna do that to me? That was the one chance I had!

1469
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:29,470
让科丽打美式足球又没什么问题，特洛伊
Ain't nothing wrong with Cory playing football, Troy.

1470
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:30,440
那小子欺骗了我
The boy lied to me.

1471
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:33,340
我跟那臭小子说过：你想继续打
I told the nigger, "you want to play football,

1472
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:34,310
就得继续完成家务
"you keep up with your chores

1473
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:37,350
继续在A&P工作，那就是条件
"hold that job down at the A&P." That was the conditions.

1474
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,520
我去过斯塔维茨基先生那里…
I stopped down to see Mr. Stawicki...

1475
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:41,550
赛季期间我下课后不能去工作，爸
I can't work after school during the football season, pop.

1476
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:44,090
我跟你说过斯塔维茨基先生会为我留着位置
I tried to tell you Mr. Stawicki was holding my job for me.

1477
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:45,690
你从不听别人说话
You don't never want to listen to nobody,

1478
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,530
然后就替我自作主张？
and then you wanna go and do this to me?

1479
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,460
我没对你做什么，这全都是你自找的
I ain't done nothin' to you. You done it to yourself.

1480
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:50,130
就因为你以前没有机会！
Just 'cause you didn't get a chance!

1481
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:52,230
你只是害怕我会比你有成就，仅此而已！
You're just scared I'm gonna be better than you, that's all!

1482
01:02:57,830 --> 01:02:59,230
- 来这  - 特洛伊
- Come here.  - Troy.

1483
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,070
特洛伊
Troy

1484
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:09,210
捡起它
Pick it up.

1485
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:19,660
戴上它
Put it on.

1486
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,400
系隐
Strap it up.

1487
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:36,370
好了，听着
All right. See

1488
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,640
你犯了个错误
You done made a mistake.

1489
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:42,410
- 我什么都没做  - 我来告诉你
- I didn't even do nothing  - I'll tell you what your mistake was.

1490
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:46,620
你挥棒了，但你没打中球
You swung at the ball and you didn't hit it.

1491
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:50,490
那是第一振，你现在在打击区
That's strike one. You in the batter's box now.

1492
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:53,620
你挥棒但没打中，明白了吗？
You swung and you missed, see?

1493
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:56,290
那是第一振
That's strike one.

1494
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:02,260
你最别被三振
Don't you strike out.

1495
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:36,460
科丽，你何不进来
Cory, why don't you come on in here,

1496
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:38,290
帮我清洁一下杯柜？
help me clean out these cupboards?

1497
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:41,530
我不会退出球队的，我不在意爸爸说什么
I ain't quitting the team. I don't care what papa says.

1498
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:43,700
他回来后我会跟他商讨的
I'll talk to him when he get back.

1499
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:45,530
他得去看你叔叔加布
He had to go see about your Uncle Gabe.

1500
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:46,970
警察又拘捕了他
Police done arrested him again.

1501
01:05:46,970 --> 01:05:48,640
说他扰乱秩序
Said he was disturbing the peace.

1502
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,310
他很快回来
He'll be back directly.

1503
01:05:50,310 --> 01:05:52,710
进来帮我刷刷杯柜
Come on in here and help me clean out these cupboards.

1504
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:54,310
来吧
Come on.

1505
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:06,460
特洛伊，他们怎说了
Troy, what they say down there?

1506
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:09,730
没说什么，我给了他们五十块，他们就让他走了
They ain't said nothing. I give them $50, they let him go.

1507
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:11,690
晚点再跟你说
I'll talk to you about it.

1508
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:12,670
科丽在哪？
Where Cory?

1509
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:15,360
他在里面帮我清洁杯柜
He in the house, helping me clean out these cupboards.

1510
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:17,370
那去叫他出来这里
All right, tell him to get his butt out here.

1511
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,670
他们只想要钱
All they want is the money.

1512
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:24,010
我去接他回来已经六七次了
This makes six, seven times, I done went down there and got him.

1513
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:26,380
他们大老远看到我来，就已经伸出手向我拿钱
See me coming, they stick out their hands.

1514
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:29,280
我明白，他们只在意钱
Yeah, I know what you mean. That's all they care about, that money.

1515
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,410
不在意对错
They don't care about what's right.

1516
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:37,290
傻子，你为何拿了硬木材回来？
Nigger, why you got to go and get some hardwood?

1517
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:39,520
你只不过是筑个藩篱而已
You ain't doing nothin' but building a little old fence.

1518
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,560
去找些松木，那才是你需要的
Get you some soft pinewood. That's all you need.

1519
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:43,360
我知道自己在做什么，这才是用在室外的木材
I know what I'm doing. This outside wood.

1520
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,560
松木是用在室内的
You put pinewood inside the house.

1521
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:48,630
松木是室内用的，这些是室外的
Pinewood inside wood. This here the outside wood.

1522
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:50,800
告诉我，籓篱要建在哪？
Now tell me, where the fence gonna be?

1523
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:54,270
你不需用上这种木材
You don't need this wood.

1524
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:56,300
你可以用松木建
You can put it up with pinewood,

1525
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:58,070
那籓篱会比你更长寿
and it'll stand as long as you gonna be here looking at it.

1526
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,610
你怎知道我何时死，朋友？
How you know how long I'm gonna be here, nigger?

1527
01:06:59,610 --> 01:07:01,440
天啊，我可能长生不老呢
Hell, I might live forever.

1528
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:04,080
我会比那霍斯利老头活得久
I'll live longer than old man Horsely.

1529
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,780
麻吉以前也总是这样说
That's what Magee used to say.

1530
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:08,380
麻吉是个大傻子，你告诉我谁会
Ah, Magee a damn fool. Now you tell me who you ever heard of

1531
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:11,520
用生锈的钳子替自己拔牙？
gonna pull their own teeth with a pair of rusty pliers?

1532
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:12,490
他们是老一辈的人
They're old folks.

1533
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,620
我祖父以前也用钳子拔牙
My granddaddy used to pull his teeth with pliers.

1534
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:16,760
以前没有牙医会为有色人种服务
They ain't had no dentists for colored folk back then.

1535
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,530
至少用清洁的钳子吧，懂吗？
Well, get clean pliers. You understand? Clean pliers.

1536
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:21,930
先消毒，再者，今非昔比了
Sterilize them. Besides, we ain't living back then.

1537
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:25,430
他只需要到戈德布卢姆牙医就行了
All he had to do was go down to Doc Goldblum's.

1538
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,870
我看到你和那来自塔拉哈西的女孩，艾伯塔
I see where you and that Tallahassee gal, that Alberta,

1539
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:30,570
看到你们老在一起
see where you all done got tight.

1540
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:31,740
什么意思？
What you mean, "got tight"?

1541
01:07:31,770 --> 01:07:34,080
我看到你经常和她打闹
I see where you be laughing and joking with her all the time.

1542
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:36,780
我跟每个人也是这样做，你懂我的，博诺
I laugh and joke with 'em all. Bono, you know me.

1543
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:38,850
不是平常那种打闹
Ain't the kind of laughing and joking I'm talking about.

1544
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:42,080
博诺先生，你好吗？
How you doing, Mr. Bono?

1545
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:43,790
科丽，拿起博诺手中的木锯开始工作
Cory, get that saw from Bono and cut some wood.

1546
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:46,460
他说木材太硬很难锯断
He talking about wood too hard to cut.

1547
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:48,490
退后点，吉姆
Go on. Stand back there, Jim.

1548
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:49,490
让那小子展示给你看
Let the young boy show you how it's done.

1549
01:07:49,890 --> 01:07:51,690
无任欢迎
He's sure welcome to it.

1550
01:07:55,670 --> 01:08:00,440
看他壮得像乔·路易斯一样[职业拳击手]
Look at that. Big, ol' strong boy, looks like Joe Louis.

1551
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:02,870
天啊，我真的老了
Hell, I must be getting old

1552
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,910
看到他工作才感到岁月不饶人
the way I'm watching that boy whip through that wood.

1553
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:07,680
我真不懂为何妈妈想要在后院筑起籓篱
I don't see why mama wants a fence around no yard no way.

1554
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:08,750
我也想知道
Damn if I know, either.

1555
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:10,850
我不知道她在提防什么
I don't know what the hell she keeping out with it.

1556
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:12,910
她又没什么别人想要的东西
She ain't got nothing nobody wants.

1557
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:16,150
有些人建籓篱来提防外面的人
Some people build fences to keep people out,

1558
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:18,620
有些人则用来让围栏内的人留住
and other people build fences to keep people in.

1559
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:21,790
罗斯想要留住你们，她太爱你们了
Rose wants to hold on to you all. She loves you.

1560
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,590
朋友，我不需要别人来提醒我我的妻子爱我
Hell, nigger, I don't need nobody to tell me my wife loves me.

1561
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,130
科丽，进去找找看有没有另一把木锯
Cory, go in the house and see if you can find the other saw.

1562
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:30,800
在哪？
Where's it at?

1563
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,770
我说找找看，看到你找到为止
I said find it. Look for it till you find it.

1564
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:39,880
把围栏内的人留住是什么意思？
What is that supposed to mean? Want to keep us in?

1565
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:55,690
特洛伊
Troy,

1566
01:08:55,690 --> 01:08:59,900
我几乎大半辈子都认识你
I done known you seem like damn near my whole life.

1567
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:02,800
你和罗斯两个都是，认识很久了
You and Rose both. I known both of you all for a long time.

1568
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,500
我还记得当初你遇见罗斯的时候
I remember when you met Rose.

1569
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:09,570
以前你在公园打棒球时
When you was hitting them baseball out of the park.

1570
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:11,940
很多女孩都追求你
A lot of them old gals was after you then.

1571
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,940
你简直是万人迷
You had the pick of the litter.

1572
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:17,810
当你选了罗斯，我很替你高兴
When you picked Rose, I was happy for you.

1573
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:21,950
那是第一次我觉得你有点理智
That's the first time I knew you had any sense.

1574
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:25,520
我想：我的好朋友特洛伊知道他想要的
I said, "my man Troy knows what he's doing.

1575
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,660
我会跟着他，他可能会带我到前所未到过的地方
"I'm gonna follow this nigger, he might take me somewhere."

1576
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:30,930
而我真的跟着你了
I been following you, too.

1577
01:09:30,930 --> 01:09:34,730
我学到了一大堆关于因果的事
I done learned a whole heap of things about life watching you.

1578
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:39,530
学到了哪些是屎
I done learned how to tell where the shit lies.

1579
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:41,770
哪些是苜蓿[分辨是非]
How to tell it from the alfalfa.

1580
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:44,910
你教了我很多事
You done learned me a lot of things.

1581
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:47,740
教我不要重蹈覆辙
Showed me how to not make the same mistakes.

1582
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:49,880
不要一步登天
To take life as it come along,

1583
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:52,750
一步一步的来
keep putting one foot in front of the other.

1584
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,650
罗斯是个好女人，特洛伊
Rose is a good woman, Troy.

1585
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:55,820
我知道
I know she a good woman.

1586
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:57,450
我跟她结婚十八年了
I've been married to her for 18 years.

1587
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,920
你到底想说什么，博诺？
What you got on your mind, Bono?

1588
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:01,490
我只是说她是个好女人，没别的
I just say she's a good woman, like I say anything.

1589
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:02,790
我不必暗示什么
I ain't got to have nothing on my mind.

1590
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:04,130
你就抛出一句她是个好女人
You just say she a good woman and leave it

1591
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,500
然后没有下文？
hanging out there like that?

1592
01:10:05,530 --> 01:10:06,850
你为何突然说她是个好女人？
Why are you telling me she a good woman?

1593
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,500
她爱你，特洛伊
She loves you, Troy. Rose loves you.

1594
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:10,570
你说我不配吗？
You saying I don't measure up?

1595
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,670
我认为那就是你想说的
That's what you tryin' to say.

1596
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:13,800
我不配她因为我在和别的女人在外面
I don't measure up 'cause I'm seeing this other gal.

1597
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:14,940
我知道你暗示什么
I know what you tryin' to say.

1598
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:17,270
我知道罗斯对你来说有多大意义
I know what Rose means to you, Troy.

1599
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:20,510
我只是想说我不想看见你对她不忠
I'm just tryin' to say I don't want to see you mess up.

1600
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:23,610
我明白
Yeah.

1601
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:29,890
感谢你
Well, I appreciate that, Bono.

1602
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:33,560
如果你对露西尔不忠
If you was messing around on Lucille,

1603
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,690
我也会跟你说同一番话
I'd be telling you the same thing.

1604
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:37,060
那就是我要说的了
That's all I got to say.

1605
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:41,060
我会说是因为我爱你们两个
I just say that 'cause I love you both.

1606
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:44,100
对
Oh. Yeah.

1607
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:47,640
你懂我的为人，我没在外面拈花惹草
You know me. I wasn't out there looking for nothing.

1608
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:50,010
我肯定你不会找到比罗斯更好的女人
You can't find a better woman than Rose, I know that.

1609
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:54,070
但看来艾伯塔总黏着我
But it seems like this woman just stuck on to me

1610
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:54,610
我怎说她都不肯离开
where I can't shake her loose.

1611
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:56,040
我试过跟她吵架或者避开她
I done wrestled with it and tried to throw her off,

1612
01:10:56,050 --> 01:10:58,750
但她反倒更缠着我了
but now she stuck on tighter.

1613
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:00,980
而现在她打算这辈子跟定我了
And now she stuck on for good.

1614
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:03,890
你总是告诉我你有分寸
You's in control. That's what you tell me all the time.

1615
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:05,750
你会对你做过的事负责任
You responsible for what you do.

1616
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,660
我没在逃避责任
I ain't ducking the responsibility of it.

1617
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:09,990
只要问心无愧就可以了
As long as it set right in my heart, then I'm okay.

1618
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:12,990
因为那是我的宗旨，它会告诉我是非对错
'Cause that's all I listen to. It tell me right and wrong every time.

1619
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,960
而我也没说要对罗斯不忠
And I ain't talking about doing Rose no bad turn.

1620
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:16,630
我爱她
I love Rose.

1621
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:18,030
她跟我这么久了
She done carried me a long ways,

1622
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,670
我为此而爱她，尊重她
and I love and respect her for that.

1623
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:20,640
我知道
I know you do.

1624
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:22,970
那就是为什么我不想看到你伤害她
That's why I don't want to see you hurt her.

1625
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:25,640
但要是她发现了怎办？
But what you gonna do when she finds out?

1626
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,980
你到时候会剩下什么？
What you got then?

1627
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:29,640
你脚踏两只船
You try to juggle both of them,

1628
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:31,350
早晚也得二舍其一
sooner or later, you gonna drop one of them.

1629
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:33,720
- 那是常识  - 我明白，博诺
- That's common sense.  - I know what you're saying, Bono.

1630
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,350
我一直在想办法
I been trying to figure a way to work it out.

1631
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:39,650
尽快，特洛伊
Work it out right, Troy.

1632
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:42,120
我不是想对你们的家事指指点点
I ain't trying to get all up between you and Rose's business,

1633
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:44,660
但趁事情还没转坏前赶快解决
but work it, so it come out right.

1634
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:46,900
那我来介入你们的家事
Hell, I get all between you and Lucille's business.

1635
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:48,600
你打算何时买
And when you gonna buy that woman

1636
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,900
她一直想要的冰箱？
that refrigerator she be wanting?

1637
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:51,770
别告诉我你没钱
And don't tell me you ain't got no money.

1638
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:52,840
我知道谁替你打理财务
I know who your banker is.

1639
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:55,700
钱该花在露西尔的冰箱上而不是放在梅隆银行内
Mellon don't need that money as bad as Lucille wants that refrigerator.

1640
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:56,780
我很清楚
I know that.

1641
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:57,810
- 告诉你吧  - 什么？
- Tell you what I'll do.  - What?

1642
01:11:57,810 --> 01:11:59,980
当你为罗斯建成籓篱时
When you finish building this fence for Rose,

1643
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:01,810
我就给露西尔买冰箱
I'll buy Lucille that refrigerator.

1644
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:04,750
你会后悔的
You done stuck your foot in your mouth now.

1645
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:07,380
朋友，你要去哪？
Hey, nigger, where you going?

1646
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:08,820
我得回家
I'm going home.

1647
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:10,720
你不是在想我会帮你吧
I know you don't expect me to help you now.

1648
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:12,090
我得保住我的钱
I'm protecting my money.

1649
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:15,690
我想看你一个人慢慢的建
I want to see you put that fence up by yourself.

1650
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:17,130
那就是我想看的
That's what I want to see.

1651
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:19,690
没有我的帮忙，六个月后你仍然毫无头绪
You'll be here another six months without me.

1652
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:20,960
朋友，那样不对啊
Nigger, you ain't right.

1653
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,830
当谈到我的钱
When it come to my money,

1654
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:25,930
我就像国庆日的烟火一样对[好]
I'm right as fireworks on the Fourth of July.

1655
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:27,400
等着瞧
We gonna see.

1656
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,100
你准备去提款吧！
You better get out your bank book!

1657
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:23,160
他们在警局在说了什么？加布怎了？
What they say down there? What's happening with Gabe?

1658
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:26,190
我过去接回他了，花了我五十块
I went down there and got him out. Cost me $50.

1659
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,900
说他在扰乱秩序
Said he was disturbing the peace.

1660
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,200
法官三周后审讯
Judge set up a hearing for him in three weeks

1661
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,000
他为何不被重新分配到医院内
to show cause why he shouldn't be recommitted.

1662
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,870
那你怎说？你怎跟法官说的
What'd you say? What'd you tell the judge?

1663
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,910
我跟他说我会照顾他
I told him I'd take care of him.

1664
01:13:36,910 --> 01:13:38,470
没有理由又分配他住医院
It didn't make no sense to recommit the man.

1665
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:39,970
他伸出他那贪婪的手
He stuck out his big greasy palm,

1666
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:42,780
跟我说交出五十块然后带他回家
told me to give him $50 and take him on home.

1667
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:44,780
那他现在在哪？
Where's he at now? Where'd he go off to?

1668
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:46,780
又到处乱跑了，他不想别人拖着他的手
Gone about his business. He don't need nobody to hold his hand.

1669
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:49,020
我也不知道，但那看来是最好的选择
Well, I don't know, seem like that would be the best place for him.

1670
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:50,050
让他住在医院里
To put him in a hospital.

1671
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,190
我知道你接下来要说什么
I know what you say gonna say,

1672
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:52,820
但那正是我认为这样做是对的原因
but that's what I think would be best.

1673
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:54,460
那他在打仗时失去的一切，为了什么？
Man had his life ruined fighting for what?

1674
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:55,890
现在他们想把他锁起来？
Now, they want to take him and lock him up?

1675
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:58,190
该给他自由啊，他又没打扰谁
Let him be free. Man ain't bothering nobody.

1676
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:02,060
我想每个人都有不同的看法
Everybody got their own way of looking at it, I guess.

1677
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:03,470
来拿你的午餐吧
Come on, get your lunch.

1678
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:05,100
我这里有些棉豆和玉米面包
I got some lima beans and cornbread in the oven.

1679
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:06,270
快去，你得吃点什么
Come on, get somethin' to eat.

1680
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,040
在这里烦恼加布的事也没帮助
Ain't no sense in you fretting over Gabe.

1681
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,210
罗斯，我有点事要跟你说
Rose, I got something to tell you.

1682
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:12,210
- 待我把食物放好再说  - 罗斯…
- Wait till I put the food on the table.  - Rose...

1683
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,010
我不知道该怎开口
Now, I don't know how to tell you this.

1684
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:21,950
但又不能瞒着你
And I can't explain it none.

1685
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:25,120
[好感]就那么一点点的积聚啊
It just sort of grows on you.

1686
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:29,190
开始时就像小木灌
It started off like a little bush,

1687
01:14:29,190 --> 01:14:30,830
待你发现时已经是整片森林了
next thing you know, it's a whole forest.

1688
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:32,060
特洛伊，你在说什么？
Troy, what is you talking about?

1689
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:33,960
我在说话，女人，让我把话说完
I'm talking, woman. Let me talk.

1690
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,930
我在跟你说
I'm trying to tell you,

1691
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:38,230
我在找个隐晦的方法跟你说…
find a way to tell you that...

1692
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:45,870
我要成为父亲了
I'm gonna be a daddy.

1693
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:50,150
对，我要成为别人的父亲了
Yeah, I'm gonna be somebody's daddy.

1694
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:57,520
特洛伊，不是真的吧？你要成为什么？
Troy, you ain't telling me this. You're gonna be what?

1695
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,990
- 你要成为别人的父亲？ - 罗斯…
- You're gonna be somebody's daddy?  - Rose...

1696
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:00,090
你竟然跟你的妻子说这个？
You're telling your wife this?

1697
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:01,160
现在…
Now...

1698
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:03,530
嗨，特洛伊，嗨，罗斯
Hey, Troy! Hey, Rose!

1699
01:15:03,530 --> 01:15:06,160
我等了十八年就为了听你说这些事吗？
I got to wait 18 years to hear something like this?

1700
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,800
嗨，罗斯
Hey, Rose.

1701
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:11,930
我有朵花送给你
I got a flower for you.

1702
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:18,070
那是朵玫瑰花，就像你的名字一样
That's a rose. The same rose like you is.

1703
01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:24,310
谢了，加布
Thanks, Gabe.

1704
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:25,980
特洛伊，你没在生我的气吧？
Troy, you ain't mad at me?

1705
01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:28,010
那些坏人抓了我回来
Them bad mens come and put me away.

1706
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:30,020
- 你没在生我的气吧？ - 没，我没有生气
- You ain't mad at me?  - No. No, I ain't mad at you.

1707
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:32,020
十八年了，你竟然做得出这种事？
Eighteen years, and you want to come with this?

1708
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:34,860
看我拿到了什么？一个全新的二十五美分
See what I got? Got a brand-new quarter.

1709
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:38,760
罗斯，只是…
Rose, it's just that...

1710
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:41,030
你没什么可以说，也不用解释
Ain't nothing you can say, Troy. Ain't no explaining it.

1711
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:43,900
给我这二十五美分的人还有一大堆
The fella that give me this quarter had a whole mess of 'em!

1712
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:46,230
我要留着它直到它暗哑无光
I'm gonna keep this quarter till it stops shining.

1713
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:49,040
加布，出去前门等我，我冰箱里有西瓜
Gabe, go on up front now. I got some watermelon in the frigidaire.

1714
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:50,210
快去，我待会拿给你
Go on. I'll get you a piece.

1715
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:53,040
罗斯，听我说，我当时在追赶地狱之犬
Say, Rose, you know, I was chasing hellhounds,

1716
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:56,040
然后那些坏人把我抓回去锁起来了
and them bad mens come and get me and take me away.

1717
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:58,110
特洛伊救了我，他来了并跟他们说
Troy helped me. He come down there and told them

1718
01:15:58,110 --> 01:16:01,120
他们最好在他打跨他们之前放了我
they better let me go before he beat them up!

1719
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:02,290
他真的说了
Yeah, he did!

1720
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,920
出去吧，加布，我待会给你西瓜
Go up front now, Gabe. I'll get you some watermelon.

1721
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:06,250
那些坏人都走了
Them bad men is gone now.

1722
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:08,920
好吧，罗斯要给我西瓜
Okay. Rose gonna give me some watermelon,

1723
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:11,290
有条纹的那种
the kind with the stripes on it.

1724
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:18,230
为什么，特洛伊？
Why, Troy?

1725
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:21,040
为什么？
Why?

1726
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:26,940
过了那么多年，你现在跟我说这些？
After all these years, you come dragging this in to me now?

1727
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:29,110
你这年纪，不应该会做的
It don't make no sense at your age.

1728
01:16:29,610 --> 01:16:33,650
我可以理解你十年或者十五年前这样做，但不是现在
I could've expected this 10, or 15 years ago, but not now.

1729
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:36,120
年龄与此没有关系，罗斯
Age ain't got nothing to do with it, Rose.

1730
01:16:40,090 --> 01:16:43,320
我做了一个妻子该做的
I done tried to be everything a wife should be.

1731
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:46,930
一个妻子可以做的所有事
Everything a wife could be.

1732
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,130
我结婚整整十八年了
I've been married 18 years,

1733
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:50,630
而现在竟到了你说
and now, I got to live to see the day you tell me

1734
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:54,240
你和别的女人有了孩子的一天
you been seeing another woman and done fathered a child by her.

1735
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:11,350
你明知道我不喜欢同父异母什么的
And you know I never wanted no half-nothing in my family!

1736
01:17:14,290 --> 01:17:15,660
我整个家庭都是这样
My whole family is half.

1737
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:17,430
每个人都有不同的父母亲
Everybody got different fathers and mothers

1738
01:17:17,430 --> 01:17:19,190
我的几个兄弟姊妹都是这样
and my two sisters and my brothers.

1739
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:21,000
你根本不知道谁是谁生的
You could hardly tell who's who.

1740
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,660
永远不能好好谈谈父母的话题
Could never sit down and talk about papa and mama.

1741
01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:25,330
因为大家的父母都不一样
It was always your papa, your mama, my papa, my mama.

1742
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:28,100
我从不想我的孩子们也是这样
And I ain't never wanted that for none of my children!

1743
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:29,340
然而现在，你竟然过来
And now, you want to drag your behind in here

1744
01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:30,510
跟我说这些事！
and tell me something like this!

1745
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:33,470
够了，你有权利知道的，是时候了
Stop it now. You ought to know. It's time for you to know.

1746
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:34,380
我才不想知道，妈的！
Well, I don't want to know, god damn it!

1747
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:55,300
罗斯
Rose?

1748
01:17:58,430 --> 01:18:02,100
我不能让她堕胎，米已成炊了
I just can't make it go away. It's done now.

1749
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:06,170
我没法改变事情
I can't wish the circumstances of the thing away.

1750
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:08,740
你也不想改变
And you don't want to, either.

1751
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:10,510
或许你想我们两母子离开
Maybe you want to wish me and my boy away.

1752
01:18:10,510 --> 01:18:12,180
也许那就是你想的
Maybe that's what you want.

1753
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:14,720
你不能这样做
Well, you can't wish us away.

1754
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,750
我把我的十八年放在你身上了
I got 18 years of my life invested in you.

1755
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:19,020
你该留在我们的床上而不是出去鬼混
You ought to have stayed upstairs in my bed where you belong.

1756
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:21,460
听着，我们可以处理好这事
Now, listen to me. We can get a handle on this thing.

1757
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:23,590
我们可以说清楚，有共识
We can talk this out, come to an understanding.

1758
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:24,760
突然间此事就是关于“我们”
All of a sudden it's "we."

1759
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:26,190
当你在外面
Where was "we" at when you were down there,

1760
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,760
跟那个可恶的女人鬼混时“我们”在哪里？
rolling around with some godforsaken woman?

1761
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,000
“我们”该在你做傻事之前
"We" should've come to an understanding

1762
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,430
就要有共识！
before you started making a damn fool of yourself!

1763
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:32,100
当说到共识时
You're a day late and a dollar short

1764
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:33,400
你总是迟了
when it comes to an understanding with me.

1765
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:39,310
罗斯，只是因为她能给我完全不同的感觉
Rose, it's just that she...gives me a different idea.

1766
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:43,080
完全不同的自我理解
A different understanding about myself.

1767
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:46,450
让我可以在这里走出去时，放下所有压力
I can step out of this house and get away from the pressures

1768
01:18:46,450 --> 01:18:48,080
和问题，变成一个完全不同的人
and the problems, be a different man.

1769
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,020
我不用担心如何修好屋顶
I ain't got to worry about how I'll get the roof fixed,

1770
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:51,490
或者付钱，或者…
or pay the bills, or...

1771
01:18:51,490 --> 01:18:53,120
我可以
I can just

1772
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:57,460
成为一个我前所未有过的自己
be a part of myself I ain't never been before.

1773
01:18:58,530 --> 01:19:01,060
我想知道的是…
What I want to know is...

1774
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:06,070
我想知道的是
What I want to know

1775
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:08,540
你是否打算继续见她？
is do you plan to continue seeing her?

1776
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:11,170
那就是你可以说的
That's all you can say to me.

1777
01:19:12,270 --> 01:19:14,110
我在她的家里能放松下来
I could sit up in her house and laugh.

1778
01:19:14,110 --> 01:19:16,380
你明白吗？
You understand what I'm saying?

1779
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:19,180
我可以放声笑，而那感觉真好
I could laugh out loud, and it feels good.

1780
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:21,380
简直好到了我心底里
It reaches all the way down to the bottom of my shoes.

1781
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:22,580
罗斯，我…
Rose, I...

1782
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:28,090
我不想放弃那些
I can't give that up.

1783
01:19:33,530 --> 01:19:35,830
那或许你该继续留在她那里
Well, maybe you ought to go on and stay down there with her,

1784
01:19:35,830 --> 01:19:37,530
如果她真是比我更好的女人的话
if she's a better woman than me.

1785
01:19:37,530 --> 01:19:39,400
这不是关于谁是更好的女人的问题
It ain't about nobody being a better woman, or nothing.

1786
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:40,470
罗斯，你尽责了
Rose, you ain't to blame.

1787
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,270
做妻子的话你简直是不二之选
A man couldn't ask for a better wife than you've been.

1788
01:19:43,270 --> 01:19:44,780
这事我得负起所有责任
I'm responsible for it.

1789
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,810
我每天重复做着同样的事
I done locked myself into a pattern,

1790
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:48,480
照顾你们，都让我忘了自己了
trying to take care of you all, that I forgot about myself.

1791
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,280
我不是一直在你背后吗？
Well, what the hell was I there for?

1792
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:51,850
那是我的工作，不是他人的
That was my job, not somebody else's.

1793
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:55,150
罗斯，听着，我竭尽所能去过正当的生活
Rose, listen to me. I done tried all my life to live decent.

1794
01:19:55,150 --> 01:19:58,150
一个正当，努力向上的生活
To live a clean, hard, useful life.

1795
01:19:58,150 --> 01:20:01,320
我尽了力去成为一个好丈夫
I try to be a good husband to you, in every way I know how.

1796
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:03,490
可能我一开始就错了吧，我不知道
Maybe I come into the world backwards, I don't know,

1797
01:20:03,490 --> 01:20:07,130
但你就像上场前已经被二振了一样
but you're born with two strikes on you before you come to the plate.

1798
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,200
你得把任何事都看管好
You got to guard it closely,

1799
01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:10,870
老是担心突发事情
always looking for the curveball on the inside corner.

1800
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:12,530
你不能让任何事不受你控制
You can't afford a called strike.

1801
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:14,170
你不能让任何事漏掉
You can't let nothing get past you.

1802
01:20:14,170 --> 01:20:16,300
要是你倒下了，你还不死心
If you're going down, you're doing down swinging.

1803
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:19,210
所有事都像对着你干一样
Everything lined up against you!

1804
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:22,310
你还想怎样？
What you gonna do?

1805
01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:26,350
我赢了他们，罗斯，我短打了[牺牲]
I fooled them, Rose. I bunted.

1806
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:30,520
当我有你和科丽和份有点像样的工作，我很安全
When I found you and Cory and a halfway decent job, I was safe.

1807
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:32,850
没什么可以拖累我了
Couldn't nothing touch me!

1808
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:34,420
我不会再被三振出局
I wasn't gonna strike out no more.

1809
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:35,860
不会再回去坐牢
I wasn't going back to the penitentiary.

1810
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:38,330
不会再喝醉，睡在街上
I wasn't gonna lie in the street with a bottle of wine.

1811
01:20:38,330 --> 01:20:42,600
我安全了，我有个家庭，有份工作
I was safe. I had me a family, a job.

1812
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:46,500
我不会被三振的
I wasn't gonna get that last strike.

1813
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:51,270
我站在一垒
I was standing on first base,

1814
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:54,310
等着回到本垒
waiting for one of them boys to knock me in, to bring me home.

1815
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:55,180
你该留在我们的床上，特洛伊
You should have stayed in my bed, Troy.

1816
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:57,210
然后我看到那女子，她让我胆大起来
Then I saw the gal, she firmed up my backbone.

1817
01:20:57,210 --> 01:20:59,580
我在想如果我努力点，或许可以盗垒
I got to thinkin' that if I tried, maybe I could steal second.

1818
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:01,380
- 你明白吗？ - 你该抱紧我
- You understand what I'm saying?  - You should've held me tight.

1819
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:03,680
你该捉紧我的手
You should've grabbed me and held on.

1820
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:04,620
我站在一垒十八年了
I stood on first base for 18 years,

1821
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:07,260
然后我想，管他的，豁出去
and I thought, well, god damn it, go on for it!

1822
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:09,590
我们不是在说棒球啊！
We ain't talking about baseball!

1823
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:12,190
我们在说你跟别的女人鬼混
We talking about you going off and laying up with another woman,

1824
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,230
然后把这事带回家跟我说
then bringing it home to me.

1825
01:21:13,230 --> 01:21:14,360
那才是我们要讨论的
That's what we're talking about.

1826
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:17,470
- 我们不是要谈棒球！ - 罗斯，你没细心听
- We're not talkin' about no baseball!  - Rose, you're not listening to me.

1827
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,630
我在用我最擅长的东西去表达
I'm trying to explain it to you the best way I know how.

1828
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:22,800
对我来说很难去接受
It's not easy for me to admit

1829
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,670
我站在原地十八年了这事实
that I've been standing in the same place for 18 years!

1830
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:28,410
我也跟你一起站在原地啊！
Well, I've been standing with you!

1831
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:32,480
我一直都跟你站在原地，特洛伊！我也有我的人生
I've been right here with you, Troy! I got a life, too.

1832
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:36,680
我为此付出了我的十八年啊
I gave 18 years of my life to stand in the same spot as you!

1833
01:21:36,690 --> 01:21:38,720
你没想过我也想要做其他事？
Don't you think I ever wanted other things?

1834
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:41,220
没想过我也有我的梦想和愿望？
Don't you think I had dreams and hopes?

1835
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:43,660
那我的生命呢？那我呢？
What about my life? What about me?

1836
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:45,260
你以为我没有想过
Don't you think it ever crossed my mind

1837
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:46,430
去认识其他男人？
to want to know other men?

1838
01:21:46,430 --> 01:21:49,200
或者一走了之
That I wanted to lay up somewhere

1839
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,700
忘了我的职责？
and forget about my responsibilities?

1840
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:52,500
或者我想有过人让我笑
That I wanted someone to make me laugh,

1841
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:54,570
让我快乐？
so I could feel good?

1842
01:21:54,570 --> 01:21:56,670
你不是唯一一个有需求的人
You're not the only one who's got wants and needs.

1843
01:21:56,670 --> 01:21:58,670
但我留下来了，特洛伊
But I held on to you, Troy.

1844
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:03,210
我把我的所有情感，需求和梦想
I took all my feelings, my wants and needs and dreams,

1845
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:04,950
埋藏在你的心底下
and I buried them inside you.

1846
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:07,380
我把种子埋藏好，每天看着它，祈望它成长
I planted a seed and watched and prayed over it.

1847
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:10,420
我把自己埋藏在你心内然后等待开花！
I planted myself inside you and waited to bloom!

1848
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:12,290
但那花了我十八年时间
And it didn't take me no 18 years

1849
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:14,390
才知道那泥土原来如石头般硬
to realize the soil was hard and rocky,

1850
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:16,490
还有它根本不会开花！
and it wasn't never gonna bloom!

1851
01:22:16,490 --> 01:22:19,490
但我仍然捉紧你，我把你捉得更紧
But I held on to you, Troy. I held you tighter.

1852
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,560
你是我的丈夫
You was my husband.

1853
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:24,370
我该给你我的全部
I owed you everything I had.

1854
01:22:24,370 --> 01:22:27,240
我的每一部分
Every part of me I could find to give you.

1855
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:30,970
当晚上我在楼上的睡房时
And upstairs in that bedroom, with the darkness falling in on me,

1856
01:22:30,970 --> 01:22:35,310
我用尽力气消除那个疑虑
I gave everything I had to try and erase the doubt

1857
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:37,780
那个其实你不是个好男人的疑虑
that you wasn't the finest man in the world.

1858
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:40,650
无论你打算去哪里，我都会跟着你
And wherever you was going, i was gonna be there with you,

1859
01:22:40,650 --> 01:22:43,380
因为你是我的丈夫
because you was my husband.

1860
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:47,660
因为这样做我才能继续做你的妻子
'Cause that's the only way I was gonna survive as your wife.

1861
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:51,330
你经常说给什么
You always talking about what you give

1862
01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:52,630
还有你不能给什么
and what you don't have to give.

1863
01:22:53,330 --> 01:22:55,000
但你也会拿取，特洛伊
But you take, too, Troy.

1864
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,670
你会拿取而且不在乎是谁付出的
You take and don't even know nobody's giving.

1865
01:22:57,670 --> 01:22:59,730
你说我好逸恶劳
You say I take and don't give.

1866
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:00,910
- 特洛伊，你弄痛我了  - 你说我好逸恶劳
- Troy, you're hurting me.  - You say I take and don't give.

1867
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:02,400
- 特洛伊，我的手很痛，放手！ - 我给了我能给的
- Troy, you're hurting my arm, let go!  - I gave you everything I got.

1868
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:03,470
别说我没有
Don't you tell that lie on me.

1869
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:04,770
- 妈妈！ - 别说我没有
- Mama!  - Don't you tell that lie!

1870
01:23:04,770 --> 01:23:06,540
特洛伊，我弄痛我了！
Troy, you're hurting me!

1871
01:23:07,010 --> 01:23:08,510
特洛伊，特洛伊
Troy! Troy!

1872
01:23:08,710 --> 01:23:12,550
好了，那是二振
All right. That's strike two.

1873
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:17,590
你别再惹我，你最好别三振
You stay away from around me, boy. Don't you strike out.

1874
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:21,390
你满球数了
You're living with a full count.

1875
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:26,630
你最好别三振！
Don't you strike out!

1876
01:26:46,930 --> 01:26:48,900
特洛伊，我想跟你说点事
Troy, I want to talk to you.

1877
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,770
突然间？
All of a sudden?

1878
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:58,040
过了这么久你想跟我说点事？
After all this time, you want to talk to me, huh?

1879
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,740
你数个月来没跟我说过一句话
You ain't wanted to talk to me in months.

1880
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:02,010
昨晚也没有
You ain't wanted to talk to me last night.

1881
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:03,740
你那时可不想理会我
You didn't want no parts of me then.

1882
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:06,510
现在你想来说什么？
What you want to talk to me about now?

1883
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:11,590
明天是星期五
Tomorrow's Friday.

1884
01:27:11,590 --> 01:27:12,890
我知道
I know what day tomorrow is.

1885
01:27:12,890 --> 01:27:14,920
你以为我不知道吗？
You think I don't know tomorrow's Friday?

1886
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:17,590
我的整生，都在等星期五的来临
My whole life, I ain't done nothing but look to see Friday coming,

1887
01:27:17,590 --> 01:27:18,260
你还来提醒我
and you got to tell me it's Friday.

1888
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:19,590
我想知道你会否回家
I want to know if you're coming home.

1889
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:22,600
我每天都回家，你知道的
I always come home, Rose. You know that.

1890
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:23,860
没有一晚我是没回来的
Ain't never been a night I ain't come home.

1891
01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:25,800
你明知道那不是我的意思
That ain't what I mean, and you know it.

1892
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:29,270
我想知道你下班后会否直接回家
I wanna know if you're coming straight home after work.

1893
01:27:29,270 --> 01:27:32,310
我想我会兑换支票，然后在泰勒的酒吧和他们喝点酒
I figured I'd cash my check, hang out at Taylors' with the boys.

1894
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:33,580
或许玩一局[西洋]跳棋
Maybe play a game of checkers.

1895
01:27:33,610 --> 01:27:36,080
特洛伊，我不能再继续这样，我接受不了
Troy, I can't live like this. I won't live like this.

1896
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,750
自那之后你就人在心不在
You're living on borrowed time with me.

1897
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:39,780
六个月以来，你都没真正回来
Been going on six months now, you ain't been coming home.

1898
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:41,880
我每晚都回来，一年来从没间断过
I come home every night. Every night of the year.

1899
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:44,620
那就整整三百六十五天
That's 365 days.

1900
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:48,690
我想你明天下班后直接回家
I want you to come home tomorrow after work.

1901
01:27:53,630 --> 01:27:57,100
罗斯，你知道我不会乱花钱
Rose, I don't mess up my pay. You know that.

1902
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:59,070
我收到工资后就全数交给你
I take my pay, i give it to you.

1903
01:27:59,070 --> 01:28:02,740
我只拿着你分配给我的部份
I don't have no money but what you give me back.

1904
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:05,910
我只想要一点私人时间而已
I just want a little time to myself.

1905
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:07,070
去享乐一下
A little time to enjoy life.

1906
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:09,040
那我呢？何时才轮到我去享乐？
What about me? When's my time to enjoy life?

1907
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:11,310
我不知道还可以说什么，我已经尽力了
I don't know what to tell you, Rose. I'm doing the best I can.

1908
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:12,680
你下班回家后
You ain't been comin' home from work,

1909
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:13,880
只换件衣服又出去了
but time enough to change your clothes and run out.

1910
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:15,950
你叫那尽力吗？
You wanna call that the best you can do?

1911
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:20,720
我晚点得去医院看艾伯塔
I'm going over to the hospital to see Alberta.

1912
01:28:21,690 --> 01:28:23,360
她今天下午进了医院
She went into the hospital this afternoon.

1913
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:26,890
看来是早产
Looks like she might have the baby early.

1914
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:29,600
我不会去太久
I won't be gone long.

1915
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:37,710
你该知道他们今天到了珀尔小姐那里
Well, you ought to know. They went over to Miss Pearl's

1916
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:38,880
带走了加布
and got Gabe today.

1917
01:28:38,910 --> 01:28:42,810
她说你叫他们锁起他来
She said you told them to go ahead and lock him up.

1918
01:28:42,810 --> 01:28:46,850
我才没有说过，你被她骗了
I ain't said no such thing. Whoever told you that is telling a lie.

1919
01:28:46,850 --> 01:28:48,720
珀尔小姐撒了个很大的谎
Miss Pearl ain't doing nothing but telling a big, fat lie.

1920
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:50,680
她不用说出口，我在文件上看到的
She ain't had to tell me. I read it on the papers.

1921
01:28:50,690 --> 01:28:52,820
- 那份文件说了什么？ - 说你叫他们去带走他
- What'd it say, huh?  - It said you told them to take him.

1922
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:54,340
那他们肯定弄错了
Oh, well, then they screwed that up,

1923
01:28:54,370 --> 01:28:55,860
就像他们弄错其他事一样
just like they screw up everything.

1924
01:28:55,890 --> 01:28:56,920
我才不在意他们在文件上说了什么
I ain't worried about what they got on that paper.

1925
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:58,390
说政府会把他的部分财产交给医院作照顾费用
It say the government sends part of the check to the hospital,

1926
01:28:58,460 --> 01:28:59,560
另一部份交给你
the other part to you.

1927
01:28:59,590 --> 01:29:02,130
我跟此事毫无关系
I ain't got nothing to do with that, if that's the way it works.

1928
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:02,630
我也没叫他们分给我
I don't make up the rules...

1929
01:29:02,630 --> 01:29:03,830
你对待加布就像你对待科丽一样差劲
You did Gabe just like you did Cory.

1930
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:05,030
你不会替科丽签署
You wouldn't sign the paper for Cory,

1931
01:29:05,030 --> 01:29:06,830
但你却替加布签了，是你签的！
but you signed for Gabe! You signed that paper!

1932
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,800
我说过我没有签署过什么，女人
I told you I ain't signed nothing, woman.

1933
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,370
天啊，我只签了份释放同意书
Hell, the only thing I signed was the release form.

1934
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:11,840
我又不识字
Hell, I can't read,

1935
01:29:11,870 --> 01:29:12,910
天知道他们在同意书上写了什么
I don't know what they had on that paper.

1936
01:29:12,910 --> 01:29:14,840
我才没签过什么送走加布的文件
I ain't signed nothing about sending Gabe away.

1937
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:17,040
我当时说送他到医院，你说要让他自由
I said send him to the hospital, you said let him go free.

1938
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:18,220
现在你反过来
Then you went down there

1939
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:20,380
同意送他到医院，就为了他的钱
and you signed him to the hospital for half his money.

1940
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:20,950
这是自相矛盾，特洛伊
You went back on yourself, Troy.

1941
01:29:20,950 --> 01:29:22,980
你会有报应的
You're gonna have to answer for that.

1942
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:23,820
你才跟珀尔小姐说过话
You just been over there talking to Miss Pearl.

1943
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:25,120
她只是因为不能再
She just mad 'cause she ain't gettin'

1944
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,390
骗加布的钱而生气，所以胡说而已
Gabe's rent money, that's all it is.

1945
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:28,320
特洛伊，我亲眼看着你签的！
Troy, I seen where you signed the paper!

1946
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:29,090
你才没有！
You ain't seen nothing I signed!

1947
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:31,930
那她家里为何又有我弟弟的文件？
And what she doing got papers on my brother for, anyway?

1948
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:35,730
珀尔小姐只是在撒谎
Miss Pearl ain't doing nothing but telling a big, fat lie,

1949
01:29:35,730 --> 01:29:37,700
我会去跟她对质！
and I'm gonna tell her about it, too!

1950
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:46,010
我没有签署过什么！
You ain't seen nothing I signed!

1951
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:48,080
还说我…
Say...

1952
01:29:49,910 --> 01:29:52,080
我没有签署过什么！
You ain't seen nothing I signed!

1953
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:50,260
特洛伊
Troy.

1954
01:31:52,530 --> 01:31:54,130
特洛伊
Troy.

1955
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:02,210
那是医院打来说艾伯塔生下来了
That was the hospital. Alberta had the baby.

1956
01:32:03,550 --> 01:32:06,210
是吗？是男还是女的？
Yeah? What she have? What is it?

1957
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:08,950
是个女孩
It's a girl.

1958
01:32:11,550 --> 01:32:13,190
我…
I...

1959
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:18,360
我该去看她一下
I better get on down there to see her.

1960
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:24,260
- 特洛伊  - 我总得去看她一下吧，罗斯
- Troy.  - I got to go see her now, Rose. That's only right.

1961
01:32:29,370 --> 01:32:33,010
怎么了？婴儿什么有问题吗？
What's the matter? Baby all right, ain't it?

1962
01:32:36,110 --> 01:32:39,210
艾伯塔产后死去了
Alberta died having the baby.

1963
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:42,350
你说她死了？
She died? You say she's dead?

1964
01:32:45,390 --> 01:32:47,020
她死了？
Alberta dead?

1965
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:50,120
他们说尽了力，他们…
They said they done all they could. They...

1966
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:53,060
他们对她无能为力
They couldn't do nothing for her.

1967
01:33:24,090 --> 01:33:27,060
那婴儿呢？她还好吗？
Oh, what about the baby? Baby all right?

1968
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,060
他们说她很健康
They say it's healthy.

1969
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:34,900
我在想谁会替她办身后事
I wonder who's gonna bury her.

1970
01:33:34,970 --> 01:33:36,070
她有家人的，罗斯
She had a family, Rose.

1971
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:37,340
她不是无亲无故
She wasn't living in the world by herself.

1972
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:39,940
我当然知道
I know she wasn't living in the world by herself.

1973
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:41,240
你下一样想知道的就是她有没有保险
Next thing you wanna know if she had any insurance.

1974
01:33:41,310 --> 01:33:42,510
你没资格跟我这样说话！
You ain't got to talk to me like that!

1975
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:44,980
你第一样关心的就是：谁会埋葬她？
First thing that jumped out your mouth. "Who's gonna bury her?"

1976
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:46,380
生怕我会付钱替她办理
Like I'm finna take that task on for myself.

1977
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:48,450
我是你的妻子，别推开我
I'm your wife. Don't push me away.

1978
01:33:48,450 --> 01:33:51,120
我没有推开谁，就给我点空间
I ain't pushing nobody away. Just give me some space.

1979
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:53,350
让我静一下
Just give me some room to breathe.

1980
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:25,550
好了，死神先生
All right, Mr. Death.

1981
01:34:31,130 --> 01:34:34,030
我来告诉你接下来的事
I tell you what I'm gonna do.

1982
01:34:34,030 --> 01:34:36,430
我会继续
I'm gonna take

1983
01:34:36,430 --> 01:34:40,500
在这后院筑起籓篱，知道吗？
and build me a fence around this yard, see?

1984
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:45,710
我会筑起籓篱保护属于我的东西
I'm gonna build me a fence around what belongs to me.

1985
01:34:45,710 --> 01:34:49,040
然后我想你留在另一边
And then I want you to stay on the other side.

1986
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:50,510
直至你准备好带走我
You stay over there till you're ready for me,

1987
01:34:50,510 --> 01:34:52,310
到时候你就尽管来吧
then you come on.

1988
01:34:54,450 --> 01:34:58,250
带上你的军队，镰刀，披上你的袍子
Bring your army, bring your sickle, bring your wrestling clothes.

1989
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:00,420
这次我不会松懈
I ain't gonna fall down on my vigilance this time.

1990
01:35:00,420 --> 01:35:02,160
你不会…
You ain't gonna...

1991
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:07,390
你不会就有机可乘
You ain't gonna sneak up on me no more.

1992
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:11,330
当你准备好时
When you ready for me,

1993
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:13,730
当你手上的名单写着特洛伊·马克森时
when the top of your list say Troy Maxson,

1994
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:16,070
到时候你就正面而来吧
then you come on up and knock on the front door.

1995
01:35:16,070 --> 01:35:18,070
其他人与此无关
Ain't nobody else got nothing to do with this.

1996
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:20,070
这是你我之间的事
This between you and me.

1997
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:24,410
男人之间！
Man to man!

1998
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:34,150
你在准备好带走我之前留在籓篱的另一边！
You stay on the other side of that fence till you ready for me!

1999
01:35:35,490 --> 01:35:38,230
然后随时都可以
Then you come up and knock on that front door

2000
01:35:38,230 --> 01:35:42,100
与我正面对决！
anytime you want!

2001
01:35:54,110 --> 01:35:56,110
我拭目以待
I'll be ready for you.

2002
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,090
罗斯
Rose?

2003
01:36:49,230 --> 01:36:52,200
我在抱着我的女孩
I'm standing here with my daughter in my arms.

2004
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:54,270
听着
Now,

2005
01:36:54,270 --> 01:36:57,340
她只不过是一个
she ain't but a wee,

2006
01:36:58,470 --> 01:36:59,870
初生的婴儿而已
bitty little old thing.

2007
01:36:59,870 --> 01:37:02,310
她跟大人间的事没有关系
She don't know nothing about grownfolk business.

2008
01:37:02,310 --> 01:37:03,710
她是无辜的
She innocent,

2009
01:37:05,850 --> 01:37:08,220
但她没有母亲
and she ain't got no mama.

2010
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:12,290
你为何告诉我这些，特洛伊？
What you telling me for, Troy?

2011
01:37:25,570 --> 01:37:27,400
那…
Well...

2012
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:31,440
我们在外面门廊好了
Guess we'll go sit out here on the porch.

2013
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:52,160
一个男人应该做他认为正确的事
A man's got to do what's right for him.

2014
01:37:55,530 --> 01:37:58,170
我毫不后悔我做过的事
I ain't sorry for nothing I done.

2015
01:37:59,530 --> 01:38:02,400
我内心感到那是对的事
It felt right in my heart.

2016
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:06,440
小宝宝在笑什么？
What you smiling at?

2017
01:38:10,510 --> 01:38:13,310
你父亲是个年纪老迈的好人
Your daddy's a great, big ol' man.

2018
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:20,620
无所畏惧，但有时候也难免会害怕
Got these great big ol' hands, but sometimes he's scared.

2019
01:38:21,460 --> 01:38:24,790
而现在你父亲正正在害怕
And right now, your daddy's scared 'cause we

2020
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:28,400
因为我们只能在这门廊坐着，无家可归
sitting out here on the porch and ain't got no home.

2021
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:30,460
我也试过居无定所
Oh, I've been homeless before.

2022
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:35,540
但我没试过带着婴儿无家可归
I ain't never had no baby with me, but I've been homeless.

2023
01:38:36,940 --> 01:38:40,340
就只是寂寞的在外面流连
You just be out there on the road by your lonesome

2024
01:38:42,310 --> 01:38:44,240
看着列车一架一架
and just see one of them trains coming by

2025
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:47,270
来了又走…
and just kinda go, say...

2026
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:18,610
她是我的女儿，罗斯，是我的…
She's my daughter, Rose, and my...

2027
01:39:20,450 --> 01:39:24,320
我的亲生骨肉，我不能遗弃她
My own flesh and blood. I can't deny her.

2028
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:27,520
就像我不能遗弃我的儿子们
No more than I can deny them boys.

2029
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:30,720
你们几母子都是我的家人
You and them boys is my family.

2030
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:36,800
你们，还有这孩子就是我唯一拥有的，所以…
You, them, and this child is all I got in this world, so...

2031
01:39:39,470 --> 01:39:41,640
我想我要说的是
I guess what I'm saying is,

2032
01:39:46,570 --> 01:39:52,480
如果你能替我照顾她，我会很感谢你
that I'd appreciate it if you was to help me take care of her.

2033
01:40:04,030 --> 01:40:05,590
好吧，特洛伊
Okay, Troy,

2034
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:09,400
你是对的
you're right.

2035
01:40:11,630 --> 01:40:13,870
我会替你照顾你的孩子
I'll take care of your baby for you.

2036
01:40:15,370 --> 01:40:17,340
因为如你所说
'Cause, like you say,

2037
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:21,310
她是无辜的
she innocent.

2038
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:26,310
总不能把父亲的罪名降到孩子身上
You can't visit the sins of the father upon the child.

2039
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:32,450
况且单亲孩子的日子会很艰难
Motherless child's got a hard time.

2040
01:40:54,110 --> 01:40:57,340
从今起，这孩子有个母亲了
From right now, this child's got a mother.

2041
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:05,890
但你是个寡夫
But you're a womanless man.

2042
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:17,920
大家都避开我
I'm coming in, everybody going out.

2043
01:42:17,930 --> 01:42:20,730
我得带这蛋糕到教堂的蛋糕义卖
I'm taking this cake down to the church for the bake sale.

2044
01:42:20,730 --> 01:42:22,960
里昂刚来过看你，想要还你的二十块
Lyons was by to see you. He stopped by to pay you your $20.

2045
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:24,630
钱就在桌上
It's laying right here on the table.

2046
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:25,700
拿着，是我的工资
Well, here go this money.

2047
01:42:25,730 --> 01:42:27,670
放在桌上吧，特洛伊，我晚点处理
Well, put it in there on the table, Troy. I'll get it.

2048
01:42:28,470 --> 01:42:29,500
你什么时候回来？
What time you coming back?

2049
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:31,040
你在这里问东问西也没用
Ain't no use in you studyin' me.

2050
01:42:31,070 --> 01:42:32,610
我何时回来也没关系
Don't matter what time I come back.

2051
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:33,840
我只是问一下而已，女人，现在都不给问了吗？
I just asked you a question, woman. Can't I ask you a question?

2052
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:34,940
特洛伊，我不想吵架
Troy, I don't want to get into it.

2053
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:36,610
你的餐在炉子里
Now, your food is in there on the stove.

2054
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:37,780
翻热一下就好了
All you got to do is heat it up.

2055
01:42:37,810 --> 01:42:40,650
还有别吃掉蛋糕
And don't be eating the rest of them cakes in there now.

2056
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:41,820
我还得用
I'm coming back for them.

2057
01:42:41,850 --> 01:42:44,020
明天下午也有蛋糕义卖
We're having a bake sale at the church tomorrow.

01:42:58,100 --> 01:43:08,450
[工资]

2059
01:43:41,810 --> 01:43:42,980
嗨，特洛伊
Hey, Troy.

2060
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:44,840
怎了，博诺？
What's happening, Bono?

2061
01:43:44,850 --> 01:43:47,750
只是想来看看你
I just thought I'd stop by to see you.

2062
01:43:47,750 --> 01:43:49,620
你家里没人，所以我猜…
Wasn't no one at the house, so I figured...

2063
01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:51,420
为什么？
What you stop by to see me for?

2064
01:43:51,420 --> 01:43:53,820
你很久没来看我了
You ain't stopped by in a month of Sundays.

2065
01:43:53,820 --> 01:43:55,760
天啊，我肯定欠了你钱还是什么的
Hell, I must owe you some money or somethin'.

2066
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:59,290
你还说，自从你升职后我都快跟不上你了
Well, since you got your promotion, I can't keep up with you.

2067
01:43:59,290 --> 01:44:00,890
以前早晚都看到你
Used to see you every day.

2068
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:03,660
现在我甚至不知道你在哪工作
Now I don't even know what route you working.

2069
01:44:03,740 --> 01:44:04,840
他们老是调配我到不同地方工作
Keep switching me around.

2070
01:44:04,870 --> 01:44:09,000
现在我负责白人的街区
Got me out there in green tree now, hauling white folk garbage.

2071
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,870
- 白人街区吗？ - 对
- Green tree, huh?  - Yeah.

2072
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:12,040
你真幸运
You lucky.

2073
01:44:12,070 --> 01:44:14,670
至少你不用搬垃圾
At least you ain't got to be lifting them barrels.

2074
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:16,840
该死的，它们越来越重
Damn if they ain't getting heavier.

2075
01:44:16,850 --> 01:44:19,610
我再多工作两年就退休了
I'm gonna put in my two years and call it quits.

2076
01:44:19,610 --> 01:44:21,680
对，我也在想退休的事
Yeah, I'm thinking about retiring myself.

2077
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:23,950
你的工作轻松多了
Oh, you got it easy.

2078
01:44:23,950 --> 01:44:27,920
你可以再多驾驶五年啊
You could drive for another five years.

2079
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:29,090
那可不同，博诺
Ain't the same, Bono.

2080
01:44:29,590 --> 01:44:32,690
驾驶不像搬垃圾
It ain't like working the back of the truck.

2081
01:44:32,690 --> 01:44:36,700
只能独自工作，没人聊天
You feel like you working by yourself. Ain't nobody to talk to.

2082
01:44:37,870 --> 01:44:40,770
不了，还是退休吧，露西尔最近怎样？
Naw, I'm thinking about retiring. How's Lucille?

2083
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:41,970
她很好
She all right.

2084
01:44:41,970 --> 01:44:45,040
她的关节炎有时候会复发
Her arthritis get to acting up on her sometimes.

2085
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:48,710
我过来时看到罗斯，她在教堂吗？
Saw Rose on the way here. She going down to the church, huh?

2086
01:44:48,980 --> 01:44:50,780
对，她过去了
Yeah, she took up going down there.

2087
01:44:50,780 --> 01:44:53,980
那些传教士只想捞油水而已
All them preachers looking to fatten their pockets.

2088
01:44:53,980 --> 01:44:56,650
这里有琴酒
Got some gin in here.

2089
01:44:56,650 --> 01:44:59,820
不了谢谢，我只是来看看你
No, thanks. I just stopped in to say hello.

2090
01:44:59,820 --> 01:45:01,890
你也可以喝一杯啊朋友，我从没…
Well, you can take a drink, nigger. I ain't...

2091
01:45:01,890 --> 01:45:04,320
认识你以来从没看过你不喝酒
I ain't never known you to say no to a drink.

2092
01:45:06,090 --> 01:45:07,330
你明天又不用上班
You ain't got to work tomorrow.

2093
01:45:07,330 --> 01:45:09,330
我只是来一下而已
I just stopped by.

2094
01:45:09,330 --> 01:45:11,360
我在想晚点到斯金纳家里
I'm thinkin' of going over to Skinner's.

2095
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:13,370
我们每星期五都会在他家里玩多米诺骨牌
We got us a domino game going over his house every Friday.

2096
01:45:13,370 --> 01:45:15,030
朋友，你才不会玩什么多米诺骨牌
Nigger, you can't play no dominoes.

2097
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:17,970
我以前老是赢你
I used to whup you four games out of five.

2098
01:45:18,340 --> 01:45:22,710
我吸取了教训，我玩牌的技术在进步
Well, that learned me. I'm getting better.

2099
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:24,610
是吗？
Yeah?

2100
01:45:31,350 --> 01:45:32,750
好吧
That's all right.

2101
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:37,660
我得走了
Look here, I got to be getting on.

2102
01:45:37,660 --> 01:45:38,930
有空来找我一下？
Stop by sometime, huh?

2103
01:45:38,930 --> 01:45:41,030
我会的，博诺
Yeah, I'll do that, Bono.

2104
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:47,870
露西尔跟罗斯说你给她买了个新冰箱
Lucille told Rose you, uh, got her that new refrigerator.

2105
01:45:47,870 --> 01:45:52,370
对啊，罗斯跟露西尔说你终于把籓篱建好了
Yeah. Rose told Lucille you had finally built your fence,

2106
01:45:52,370 --> 01:45:54,170
所以我想我们就扯平了
so, I figured we'd call it even.

2107
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:56,840
我就知道你信守承诺
I knew you would.

2108
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:57,910
是啊
Yeah.

2109
01:45:59,980 --> 01:46:01,180
好了
Okay.

2110
01:46:02,650 --> 01:46:03,720
再见
I'll be talking to you.

2111
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:06,390
很高兴看到你，博诺
Yeah, good to see you, Bono.

2112
01:46:06,390 --> 01:46:08,020
我有空会来找你的
I'm gonna stop over.

2113
01:46:08,020 --> 01:46:10,020
好吧，特洛伊
Yeah. Okay, Troy.

2114
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:54,050
[美国海军陆战队招募署]

2115
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:39,510
我要进去
I got to get by.

2116
01:47:39,510 --> 01:47:40,910
你说什么？
Say what? What you say?

2117
01:47:41,050 --> 01:47:43,320
你挡着我了，我得进去
You in my way. I got to get by.

2118
01:47:47,090 --> 01:47:49,060
你得去哪？
You got to get by where?

2119
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:53,990
这是我付钱买的房子
This is my house. Bought and paid for.

2120
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,060
花了我十五年之久，如果你想进我的房子
Took me 15 years, and if you want to go in my house

2121
01:47:57,070 --> 01:47:59,030
而我坐在家门楼梯上的话，你该说“请让一下”
and I'm sitting on the steps, you say, "excuse me,"

2122
01:47:59,030 --> 01:48:00,300
就像你妈妈教你那样
like your mama taught you.

2123
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:01,230
得了吧，爸，我得进去
Come on, pop, I gotta get by.

2124
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:02,540
你想就这样无视我？
You just gonna walk over the top of me?

2125
01:48:02,540 --> 01:48:04,270
我也在这里住的
I live here, too.

2126
01:48:04,270 --> 01:48:07,010
你想在我的地方无视我？
You just gonna walk over the top of me in my own house?

2127
01:48:07,010 --> 01:48:08,240
我不怕你
I ain't scared of you.

2128
01:48:08,540 --> 01:48:10,040
我没在问你是否害怕我
I ain't asked you if you was scared of me.

2129
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:12,040
我是问你是否要在
I asked you was you finna walk over the top of me

2130
01:48:12,050 --> 01:48:13,780
我的地方无视我？那才是我问的
in my own house? That was the question.

2131
01:48:13,780 --> 01:48:15,080
你不会说“请让一下”
You ain't gonna say, "excuse me."

2132
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:16,250
你就这样无视我
You just gonna walk over the top of me.

2133
01:48:16,250 --> 01:48:17,380
随便你怎说
If you want to put it like that.

2134
01:48:17,390 --> 01:48:18,550
我怎说了？
How else am I gonna put it?

2135
01:48:18,550 --> 01:48:20,850
我是想绕过你进去
I was walking by you to go into the house,

2136
01:48:20,860 --> 01:48:22,520
因为你醉了，在楼梯上唱歌
'cause you sitting on the steps drunk, singing to yourself.

2137
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:24,820
- 你也可以这样说  - 也不说“请让一下”？
- You can put it like that.  - Without saying, "excuse me"?

2138
01:48:29,860 --> 01:48:32,570
我问你了，也不说“请让一下”？
I asked you a question. Without saying, "excuse me"?

2139
01:48:32,570 --> 01:48:33,970
我不用对你客气
I ain't got to say "excuse me" to you.

2140
01:48:33,970 --> 01:48:36,140
你在这个家里不重要了
You don't count around here no more.

2141
01:48:38,540 --> 01:48:40,240
我懂了，我在这里不重要了
Oh, I see. I don't count around here no more.

2142
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:42,010
你也不用跟你的父亲客气了
You ain't got to say "excuse me" to your daddy.

2143
01:48:42,010 --> 01:48:44,840
突然间，你就可以作主
All of a sudden, you done got so grown,

2144
01:48:44,850 --> 01:48:47,280
认为你父亲在这里不重要对吧？
where your daddy don't count around here no more, huh?

2145
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:49,050
在他辛劳工作才得以
Around here in his own house and yard

2146
01:48:49,050 --> 01:48:51,120
买回来的地方吗？
that he done paid for with the sweat of his brow?

2147
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:53,950
突然间，你就可以作主
All of a sudden, you done got so grown

2148
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:55,420
认为你父亲在这里毫无地位
that your daddy don't even count around here.

2149
01:48:55,420 --> 01:48:57,020
你要成为一家之主吗？
What, you gonna take over?

2150
01:48:58,360 --> 01:49:01,360
你要接管我的屋子吗？你要拿走我的东西吗？
You gonna take over my house? You gonna wear my pants?

2151
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:03,400
你要睡在我的床上吗？
You gonna go in there and stretch out on my bed?

2152
01:49:05,170 --> 01:49:07,000
你认为你不用再对你父亲客气
You ain't got to say, "excuse me,"

2153
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,040
因为他在这里毫无地位
because your daddy don't count around here no more.

2154
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:11,170
- 对吗？ - 正是
- Is that right?  - That's right.

2155
01:49:11,170 --> 01:49:12,910
你老是说这种蠢事
You always talking this dumb stuff.

2156
01:49:12,910 --> 01:49:14,040
为何不放过我一下？
Now why don't you just get out my way?

2157
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:16,880
我猜你有自己的房子了
I guess you got some place to sleep.

2158
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:20,980
也能够养活自己，你能吗？
Something to put in your belly. You got that?

2159
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:26,250
因为那就是你需要做到的，你能吗？
'Cause that's what you need. You got that?

2160
01:49:27,450 --> 01:49:29,990
你不知道我有什么能耐！你也没有权利过问！
You don't know what I got! You ain't got to worry about what I got!

2161
01:49:30,190 --> 01:49:32,060
你说得对
You right.

2162
01:49:32,060 --> 01:49:33,860
完全正确
You 100% right.

2163
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:37,400
十七年来我一直都照顾你，担心你
I done spent the last 17 years worrying about what you got.

2164
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:39,270
所以现在轮到你作主了吗？
Now, it's your turn, see?

2165
01:49:39,270 --> 01:49:41,400
我跟你说清楚现在的情况
I tell you what we do.

2166
01:49:42,940 --> 01:49:45,400
你长大了，我们都知道吧
You grown. We done established that.

2167
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:48,640
你说你是成人，现在就看看你到底是不是
You a man. Now, let's see you act like one.

2168
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:50,410
你现在转身离开这里
Turn your behind around and walk out this yard.

2169
01:49:50,410 --> 01:49:52,140
当你走出巷子时
And when you get out there in the alley,

2170
01:49:52,150 --> 01:49:53,650
你把这间屋子抛诸脑后
you can forget about this house, see.

2171
01:49:53,650 --> 01:49:55,110
因为这是我的房子
'Cause this is my house.

2172
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:57,950
你出去，成为你所谓的大人，然后找个地方住
You go on and be a man and get your own house.

2173
01:49:57,950 --> 01:50:00,220
你可以把这一切忘掉，因为这都是我的
You can forget about this, 'cause this is mine.

2174
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:02,920
你出去过你的生活，因为我已经不想再为你做什么了
You go on and get yours, 'cause I'm through doing for you.

2175
01:50:03,090 --> 01:50:05,060
还扯为我做的事，你给过我什么？
What you done for me. What you ever give me?

2176
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:08,390
你的身体，那个还在跳动的心脏，臭小子
Them feet. Them bones. That pumping heart, nigger!

2177
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:11,330
我比任何人给过你的都多
Give you more than anybody else ever gonna give you.

2178
01:50:11,330 --> 01:50:13,670
你才没有给过我什么！
You ain't never gave me nothing!

2179
01:50:13,670 --> 01:50:15,300
你只会拖累我
You ain't never done nothing but hold me back,

2180
01:50:15,300 --> 01:50:17,970
害怕我会比你有成就！
afraid I was gonna be better than you!

2181
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:21,410
你做过的所有只是想让我害怕你
All you ever did was try and make me scared of you.

2182
01:50:21,410 --> 01:50:23,440
以前你每一次叫我的时候，我都在颤抖
I used to tremble every time you called my name.

2183
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:26,310
每一次我在屋里听到你的脚步声也是
Every time I heard your footsteps in this house.

2184
01:50:26,310 --> 01:50:28,250
总是在想：如果我这样做，爸怎样反应？
Wondering all the time, "what's pop gonna say if I do this?

2185
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:29,520
他又会怎样说？
"What's he gonna say if I do that?

2186
01:50:29,550 --> 01:50:31,650
如果我打开收音机他又会怎说？
"What's pop gonna say if I turn on the radio?"

2187
01:50:31,650 --> 01:50:34,170
妈妈也是！她试着不去害怕你，但终究也没用
And mom, too! She tries, but she's scared of you.

2188
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:35,120
你妈妈与此无关，她…
Leave your mama out of this. Your mama ain't got...

2189
01:50:35,150 --> 01:50:37,260
真不懂为何你这样对她后，她还能接受你
I don't know how she stands you after what you did to her!

2190
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:38,690
我说过，别把你妈妈混进这事
I told you, leave your mama outta this.

2191
01:50:38,690 --> 01:50:39,390
你要怎样做？打我吗？
What are you gonna do? Give me a whupping?

2192
01:50:39,390 --> 01:50:41,430
你不能再打我了！你太老了
You can't whup me no more! You're too old!

2193
01:50:41,430 --> 01:50:42,930
你只是个老头而已
You're just an old man.

2194
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:44,160
臭小子！
Nigger!

2195
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:46,230
你就是这样，只是个…
That's what you are. You're just...

2196
01:50:48,270 --> 01:50:51,270
对我来说你只是个街上的流氓而已
You're just another nigger on the street to me.

2197
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:52,340
你疯了！你知道吗？
You're crazy! You know that?

2198
01:50:52,340 --> 01:50:53,710
对，去吧
Yeah, go on.

2199
01:50:53,710 --> 01:50:56,140
就这样无视我，你骨子里头是个恶人
Get on away from around me. You got the devil in you.

2200
01:50:56,140 --> 01:50:58,310
你只是个疯老头！还说我是恶人
You are just a crazy old man! Talkin' about I got the "devil" in me!

2201
01:50:58,310 --> 01:50:59,410
对，我疯了
Yeah. I am crazy.

2202
01:50:59,410 --> 01:51:01,380
如果你不滚出我的院子
If you don't get the hell out of my yard,

2203
01:51:01,380 --> 01:51:03,450
我会让你看看我有多疯
I'm gonna show you how crazy I am.

2204
01:51:03,450 --> 01:51:05,180
快滚出我的院子！
Now, go on, get the hell out of my yard!

2205
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:06,260
这不是你的院子！
This ain't your yard!

2206
01:51:06,290 --> 01:51:08,150
你拿了加布叔叔打仗后的赔偿
You took Uncle Gabe's money he got from the army

2207
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:09,690
去买这间房子，然后赶走他了
to buy this house, when you put him out!

2208
01:51:09,690 --> 01:51:12,290
快滚出我的院子
Get your black ass out of my yard!

2209
01:51:12,290 --> 01:51:13,690
我哪都不去！
I ain't going nowhere!

2210
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:15,390
来啊，赶走我啊，我才不怕你
Come on, put me out, i ain't scared of you.

2211
01:51:17,300 --> 01:51:19,170
- 那是我的球棒  - 来啊
- That's my bat.  - Come on.

2212
01:51:19,170 --> 01:51:21,030
- 放下我的球棒  - 来啊，赶走我！
- Put my bat down.  - Come on, put me out!

2213
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,200
怎么了？你要是那么棒，赶走我啊！
What's the matter? You so bad. Put me out!

2214
01:51:24,370 --> 01:51:26,340
你要有用它的打算
You're gonna have to use it.

2215
01:51:28,210 --> 01:51:31,110
你敢对着我拿起球棒，就要有用它的打算
You want to draw that bat back on me, you're gonna have to use it.

2216
01:51:31,110 --> 01:51:32,180
来啊！
Come on!

2217
01:51:33,250 --> 01:51:34,710
来啊！
Come on!

2218
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:37,120
你要有打死我的打算
You're gonna have to kill me.

2219
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:40,290
要是你敢对着我拿起球棒
You want to draw that bat back on me,

2220
01:51:41,460 --> 01:51:43,260
你就要有打死我的打算
you're gonna have to kill me.

2221
01:51:44,730 --> 01:51:46,060
来啊
Come on.

2222
01:51:52,770 --> 01:51:56,140
你过来，我教你
Come on. Then I'll show you.

2223
01:51:56,770 --> 01:51:58,100
来啊！
Come on!

2224
01:52:37,180 --> 01:52:39,310
走吧，别再在我的房子出现
Go on, get away from around my house.

2225
01:52:49,090 --> 01:52:50,160
走啊
Go on.

2226
01:52:50,790 --> 01:52:52,790
跟妈妈说我会回来收拾细软
Tell mama I'll be back for my things.

2227
01:52:52,790 --> 01:52:55,660
你的东西会被扔出这藩篱外！
They'll be on the other side of that fence!

2228
01:53:08,140 --> 01:53:09,640
感受不到
Can't taste nothing.

2229
01:53:20,290 --> 01:53:22,460
我什么都感受不到
I can't taste nothing.

2230
01:53:25,390 --> 01:53:29,300
哈利路亚
Hallelujah!

2231
01:53:32,170 --> 01:53:33,570
哈利路亚
Hallelujah.

2232
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:45,510
哈利路亚
Hallelujah.

2233
01:53:48,180 --> 01:53:50,480
我什么都感受不到了
I can't taste nothing no more.

2234
01:53:58,330 --> 01:53:59,590
来吧
Come on.

2235
01:54:00,530 --> 01:54:02,660
你和我作个了断吧
It's between you and me now.

2236
01:54:04,200 --> 01:54:07,700
来吧，随时都行
Come on. Anytime you want.

2237
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:12,400
来吧，我准备好了
Come on. I be ready for you.

2238
01:54:14,170 --> 01:54:16,710
但你别想能全身而退
But I ain't gonna be easy.

2239
01:54:29,220 --> 01:54:30,220
撒霏儿？
Raynell?

2240
01:54:30,220 --> 01:54:32,390
- 夫人？ - 你在做什么？
- Ma'am?  - What you doing?

2241
01:54:32,460 --> 01:54:33,460
没什么
Nothing.

2242
01:54:33,490 --> 01:54:36,300
进来换衣服吧，你在做什么？
Get in here and get dressed. What are you doing?

2243
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:38,230
看看它们有没有长大
See if my garden growed.

2244
01:54:38,230 --> 01:54:39,570
我说过它们不会一晚就长大
I told you it ain't gonna grow overnight.

2245
01:54:39,570 --> 01:54:40,730
你得耐心点
You got to wait.

2246
01:54:40,740 --> 01:54:43,700
对，但那看起好像永远不会长大，该死的！
Yeah, but it look like it ain't never gonna grow, mama. Dag!

2247
01:54:44,370 --> 01:54:46,910
我说过，心急水不沸
I told you, a watched pot never boils.

2248
01:54:46,910 --> 01:54:48,680
那可不同，妈妈
This ain't even no pot, mama.

2249
01:54:48,710 --> 01:54:49,480
进来换衣服
Get in here and get dressed.

2250
01:54:49,510 --> 01:54:51,510
这不是出外玩的时候，听到了吗？
This ain't no morning to be playing around, you hear me?

2251
01:54:52,210 --> 01:54:53,480
明白，夫人
Yes, ma'am.

2252
01:54:56,180 --> 01:54:58,280
再见，小田园
Bye, garden.

2253
01:55:19,510 --> 01:55:22,740
你好，你想必就是撒霏儿吧
Hi. I bet your name is Raynell.

2254
01:55:25,410 --> 01:55:26,680
你妈妈在家吗？
Is your mama home?

2255
01:55:28,420 --> 01:55:30,480
妈妈，有个男人找你！
Mama, there's a man down here!

2256
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:32,380
妈妈
Mama!

2257
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:34,420
科丽
Cory?

2258
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:37,790
科丽
Cory.

2259
01:55:38,630 --> 01:55:40,490
科丽，科丽
Cory. Cory!

2260
01:55:40,730 --> 01:55:44,660
- 噢，我主慈悲！ - 科丽
- Oh! Lord have mercy!  - Cory.

2261
01:55:48,770 --> 01:55:50,400
你们看看谁来了
Lookee here, y'all.

2262
01:55:52,240 --> 01:55:54,470
看他啊
Aww, looka here.

2263
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:57,310
都长大了
Done got all grown up.

2264
01:55:57,310 --> 01:55:58,740
别哭，妈妈，为何要哭呢？
Don't cry, mama. What you crying about?

2265
01:55:58,750 --> 01:56:01,480
只是因为你出现了
I'm just so glad you made it.

2266
01:56:01,480 --> 01:56:03,580
嗨，里昂，你最近怎了，博诺先生？
Hey, Lyons. How you doing, Mr. Bono?

2267
01:56:03,580 --> 01:56:05,650
看看你啊，老兄
Look at you, man, look at you.

2268
01:56:05,650 --> 01:56:08,590
他看上去很威风凛凛吧，罗斯？都是下士了
Don't he look good, Rose? Got on them corporal stripes.

2269
01:56:08,590 --> 01:56:10,260
为何现在才来？
What took you so long?

2270
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:11,290
你知道军队怎操作的吧，妈妈
You know how the marines are, mama.

2271
01:56:11,290 --> 01:56:12,590
他们得把所有文件检查清楚
They got to get all their paperwork straight

2272
01:56:12,590 --> 01:56:13,990
才让你做任何事
before they let you do anything.

2273
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,430
怎样都好，我很高兴你赶来了，他们让里昂来
Well, I'm sure glad you made it. They let Lyons come.

2274
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:18,600
你的叔叔加布还在医院内
Your Uncle Gabe's still in the hospital.

2275
01:56:18,630 --> 01:56:20,700
他们不知道该否让他出来
They don't know if they're gonna let him out or not.

2276
01:56:20,700 --> 01:56:22,400
我刚跟他们说过话
I talked to them a little while ago.

2277
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:24,740
美国海军陆战队的下士
A corporal in the United States marines.

2278
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:27,010
你爸爸早知道你是军人的材料
Your daddy knew you had it in you.

2279
01:56:27,010 --> 01:56:29,010
他以前总是这样告诉我
He used to tell me all the time.

2280
01:56:29,010 --> 01:56:31,010
他看上去很不错吧，博诺先生？
Hey, don't he look good, Mr. Bono?

2281
01:56:31,010 --> 01:56:34,680
对，他让我记起我第一次见到的特洛伊
Yeah, he reminds me of Troy when I first met him.

2282
01:56:35,620 --> 01:56:37,350
我说，罗斯
Ah, say, Rose,

2283
01:56:37,350 --> 01:56:39,620
露西尔现在在教堂和唱诗班一起
Lucille's down at the church with the choir.

2284
01:56:39,620 --> 01:56:41,620
我先去跟那些护柩者说一下
I'm gonna go get the pallbearers lined up.

2285
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:42,820
晚点回来
I'll be back to get you all.

2286
01:56:43,060 --> 01:56:44,490
谢谢，吉姆
Thanks, Jim.

2287
01:56:44,490 --> 01:56:45,560
晚点见，博诺先生
See you, Mr. Bono.

2288
01:56:49,530 --> 01:56:52,630
科丽，看看撒霏儿
Cory, look at Raynell.

2289
01:56:52,630 --> 01:56:53,730
不是很美吗？
Ain't she precious?

2290
01:56:53,730 --> 01:56:55,400
她将来定是个大美人
She's gonna break a whole lot of hearts.

2291
01:56:55,540 --> 01:56:57,070
跟你的哥哥打招呼，这是你的哥哥科丽
Say hello to your brother. This your brother, Cory.

2292
01:56:57,070 --> 01:56:58,440
你记得科丽吗？
You remember Cory?

2293
01:56:58,440 --> 01:56:59,510
不记得，夫人
No, ma'am.

2294
01:56:59,510 --> 01:57:01,540
她怎可能记得我，妈妈
Naw, she don't remember me, mama.

2295
01:57:01,540 --> 01:57:03,440
我们有时候会说起你，她也在的
Oh, well, we talk about you. She heard us talk about you.

2296
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:06,510
这是你的哥哥科丽，快打招呼
This is your brother, Cory. Say hello.

2297
01:57:06,510 --> 01:57:07,780
- 你好  - 你好
- Hi.  - Hi.

2298
01:57:07,780 --> 01:57:09,380
所以你就是撒霏儿吧
So, you're Raynell.

2299
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:12,720
妈妈说了很多关于你的事给我
Mama's told me a lot about you.

2300
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:15,050
让我煮点早餐给你吃，别饿坏
Come on, let me fix you some breakfast. Keep up your strength.

2301
01:57:15,130 --> 01:57:16,230
我不饿，妈妈
I ain't hungry, mama.

2302
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:19,360
你可以煮点什么给我，我待会进去找你
You can fix me something, Rose. I'll be in there in a minute.

2303
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:20,660
你确定不吃点什么吗，科丽？
You sure you don't want nothing, Cory?

2304
01:57:20,660 --> 01:57:22,460
我知道他们没什么好吃的给你
I know they ain't feeding you right.

2305
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:23,760
不了，妈妈，谢谢，我现在不想吃
No, mama, thanks. I don't feel like eating.

2306
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:24,860
晚点吧
I'll get something later.

2307
01:57:24,870 --> 01:57:28,830
撒霏儿，去拿那件我告诉你的衣服
Raynell, get up there and get that dress on like I told you.

2308
01:57:40,110 --> 01:57:43,450
我早就知道你能成就大事
I always knew you was gonna make something out of yourself.

2309
01:57:44,850 --> 01:57:47,620
你永远朝着正确的方向走
Your head was always in the right direction.

2310
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:51,660
所以
So,

2311
01:57:53,390 --> 01:57:54,890
你打算继续服役吗？
you gonna stay in?

2312
01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:57,500
让它成为你的事业？为军队付出二十年？
Make it a career? Put in your 20 years?

2313
01:57:57,700 --> 01:58:01,500
我不知道，已经服役六年了，我想已经足够了
I don't know. I got six already. I think that's enough.

2314
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:05,100
为美国效力然后早早退休
Stick with Uncle Sam and retire early.

2315
01:58:05,110 --> 01:58:06,910
这里没有什么
Ain't nothing out here.

2316
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:11,510
我想罗斯跟你说过我发生什么事了吧
I guess Rose told you about what happened with me.

2317
01:58:13,780 --> 01:58:16,650
他们现在让我在囚犯工厂工作
They got me down at the workhouse.

2318
01:58:16,650 --> 01:58:19,520
我自以为偷偷的兑现他人支票很聪明
I thought I was being slick cashing other people's checks.

2319
01:58:20,690 --> 01:58:22,590
被判多少年了？
How much time you doing?

2320
01:58:23,420 --> 01:58:25,790
三年
They give me three years.

2321
01:58:25,790 --> 01:58:28,960
我接受了，现在只剩九个月
I got that beat now. I ain't got but nine more months.

2322
01:58:34,470 --> 01:58:36,800
那也不是件坏事
It ain't so bad.

2323
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:39,840
你能学会如何面对它，像面对其他事一样
You learn to deal with it like anything else.

2324
01:58:42,140 --> 01:58:44,140
人生不如意事十常八九
"You got to take the crookeds with the straights,"

2325
01:58:44,150 --> 01:58:47,550
那就是爸爸的座右铭
that's what papa used to say.

2326
01:58:47,550 --> 01:58:51,150
他以前被三振后老是这样说
He used to say that when he struck out.

2327
01:58:51,150 --> 01:58:53,520
我看见过他被连续三次三振
I seen him strike out three times in a row,

2328
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:57,720
再上场时，他把球打到看台上
and the next time up, he hit the ball over the grandstand.

2329
01:58:57,730 --> 01:59:00,760
在霍姆斯特德的棒球场上[佛罗里达州]
Right out there in Homestead field.

2330
01:59:01,460 --> 01:59:03,430
他打到看台上还不满意
He wasn't satisfied hitting in the seats.

2331
01:59:03,430 --> 01:59:05,430
他想打出球场外
He wanted to hit it over everything.

2332
01:59:06,670 --> 01:59:08,530
比赛完结后
Then after the game,

2333
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:14,570
有两百位观众等着与他握手
he had 200 people standing around, waiting to shake his hand.

2334
01:59:17,780 --> 01:59:20,580
人生不如意事十常八九
You got to take the crookeds with the straights.

2335
01:59:23,950 --> 01:59:25,850
他真与众不同
Papa was something else.

2336
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:29,220
你还在玩音乐吗？
You still playing?

2337
01:59:29,220 --> 01:59:30,920
科丽，你知道我不会放弃音乐的
Cory, you know I'm gonna do that.

2338
01:59:31,790 --> 01:59:34,190
我跟那里几个志同道合的人，组成了乐队
We got some fellas down there. We got us a band.

2339
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:37,230
出狱后我们打算继续一起表演，但…
We gonna try to stay together when we get out, but...

2340
01:59:37,230 --> 01:59:38,560
对
Yeah.

2341
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:41,930
我还在玩音乐
I'm still playing.

2342
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:44,000
它仍然是我有动力活下去的原因
Still helps me get out of bed in the morning.

2343
01:59:44,070 --> 01:59:45,170
只要它一天是
As long as it do that,

2344
01:59:45,200 --> 01:59:48,870
我就不会放弃它，更认真对待它
I'm gonna stick with it, try to make some sense out of it.

2345
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:51,610
里昂，我煮了蛋给你
Lyons, I got these eggs in a pan.

2346
01:59:53,710 --> 01:59:55,880
让我进去吃点什么，老兄
Let me get in here and get these eggs, man.

2347
01:59:55,880 --> 01:59:57,950
然后准备让爸爸入土
Get ready to go bury papa.

2348
02:00:03,890 --> 02:00:05,520
你过得怎样了？
How you doing?

2349
02:00:06,890 --> 02:00:08,590
你还好吗？
You doing all right?

2350
02:00:26,250 --> 02:00:28,980
你好
Hi.

2351
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:31,650
你以前睡在我的房间吗？
You used to sleep in my room?

2352
02:00:32,790 --> 02:00:34,850
对，那以前是我的房间
Yeah, that used to be my room.

2353
02:00:35,290 --> 02:00:38,520
那就是爸爸说的，科丽的房间
That's what papa callit. "Cory's room."

2354
02:00:40,660 --> 02:00:42,730
你的美式足球还在柜里
Got your football in the closet.

2355
02:00:42,730 --> 02:00:45,830
撒霏儿，快换衣服，也穿上新的鞋子
Raynell. Get up there, get dressed, and put them good shoes on.

2356
02:00:45,830 --> 02:00:48,030
妈妈，我就不能穿这双吗？那双新鞋子弄痛我的脚
Mama, can I just wear these? Them others hurt my feet!

2357
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:50,300
那也只会弄痛一会儿而已
Well, they're just gonna have to hurt your feet for a while.

2358
02:00:50,300 --> 02:00:51,270
你买的时候
You ain't said they hurt your feet

2359
02:00:51,270 --> 02:00:52,740
也没说它们会弄痛你
when you went down to the store and got 'em.

2360
02:00:52,740 --> 02:00:54,870
那时候不痛，现在我的双脚都长大了
They didn't hurt then. My feet done got bigger.

2361
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:56,680
别给我顶嘴！
Don't give me no back talk!

2362
02:00:56,680 --> 02:00:59,650
快换衣服，穿上新鞋子
Get up there, get dressed, and put them good shoes on.

2363
02:02:07,010 --> 02:02:09,950
这里没什么大改变
Ain't too much changed.

2364
02:02:09,950 --> 02:02:12,820
那棒球还吊在树上
He still got that rag tied to the tree.

2365
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:17,990
他当时在这里挥棒
He was out here swinging that bat.

2366
02:02:19,660 --> 02:02:22,630
我刚想回去屋子内
I was just getting ready to go back in the house.

2367
02:02:23,700 --> 02:02:26,630
他一挥，然后整个人就倒下了
He swung that bat and just fell over.

2368
02:02:28,870 --> 02:02:32,840
当他挥棒时，他看起来好像在笑
Seem like, when he swung it, he stood there with this grin on his face.

2369
02:02:38,710 --> 02:02:40,210
下一秒就倒下了
Then he just fell over.

2370
02:02:43,050 --> 02:02:44,850
他们来把他送到医院
They carried him down there to the hospital,

2371
02:02:44,850 --> 02:02:46,950
但我知道已经没有需要了
but I knew there wasn't no need.

2372
02:02:49,420 --> 02:02:50,420
不如跟我进去再说？
Why don't you come on in the house?

2373
02:02:50,420 --> 02:02:53,060
妈妈，我有点事要告诉你
Mama, I got something to tell you.

2374
02:02:54,390 --> 02:02:57,730
我不知道该怎开口，但我得告诉你
I don't know how to tell you this, but I got to tell you.

2375
02:02:57,730 --> 02:02:59,800
我不会出席爸爸的葬礼
I'm not going to papa's funeral.

2376
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,900
小子，闭嘴
Boy, hush your mouth.

2377
02:03:05,910 --> 02:03:08,070
那是你的爸爸！
That's your daddy you talking about!

2378
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:10,140
我不想在这种时候听到你说这个
I don't want to hear that kind of talk this morning.

2379
02:03:10,140 --> 02:03:11,780
我这么辛苦把你养成这样的吗？
I done raised you to come to this?

2380
02:03:11,780 --> 02:03:13,510
你健健康康的
You standing there all healthy and grown,

2381
02:03:13,510 --> 02:03:14,980
怎么说你不出席爸爸的葬礼了？
talking about you ain't going to your daddy's funeral?

2382
02:03:14,980 --> 02:03:17,150
- 妈妈，听着  - 我不想听，科丽！
- Mama, listen...  - I don't want to hear it, Cory!

2383
02:03:17,220 --> 02:03:18,420
别再改样想了
Just get that thought out of your head.

2384
02:03:18,450 --> 02:03:21,220
我得向他说不，就一次，我得说不
I've got to say no to him. One time in my life, I got to say no.

2385
02:03:21,220 --> 02:03:22,990
我不想听这些！
I don't got to listen to that!

2386
02:03:22,990 --> 02:03:24,760
我知道你和你爸爸不和
Now, I know you and your daddy ain't seen eye to eye,

2387
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:28,090
但我不想在这种时候听到你说出这种话
but I don't have to listen to that kind of talk this morning.

2388
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:30,900
不尊重父亲不是作为一个男人该做的事，科丽
Disrespecting your daddy ain't gonna make you a man, Cory.

2389
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:32,760
你得找个方法让自己接受
You gotta find some way to come to that on your own.

2390
02:03:32,770 --> 02:03:35,130
不出席你爸爸的葬礼不会让你成人的
Not going to your daddy's funeral ain't gonna make you a man.

2391
02:03:38,100 --> 02:03:41,110
我以前在这里的日子
The whole time I was growing up, living in his house,

2392
02:03:41,110 --> 02:03:44,110
爸爸就像一道永远跟着你的黑影
papa was like a shadow that followed you everywhere.

2393
02:03:44,910 --> 02:03:48,110
它就像个重担，它会侵蚀到你体内
It weighed on you, and it sunk into your flesh.

2394
02:03:48,850 --> 02:03:50,880
它会把你紧紧的包着，不让你走
It would wrap around you and lay there

2395
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:53,220
直到你分不清哪个才是真正的自己
until you couldn't tell which one was you anymore.

2396
02:03:53,220 --> 02:03:57,760
那黑影就一点点的侵蚀到你皮下
That shadow just diggin' into your flesh!

2397
02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:00,030
试着占据你的心，然后控制你
Trying to crawl in. Trying to live through you.

2398
02:04:00,930 --> 02:04:05,760
哪里都是特洛伊·马克森的踪影
Everywhere I looked, I saw Troy Maxson staring right back at me.

2399
02:04:05,770 --> 02:04:08,930
在你床下，又或是在衣柜内
Hiding under the bed, in the closet.

2400
02:04:08,940 --> 02:04:10,470
我只是想说我得找个方法
I'm just saying I got to find a way

2401
02:04:10,470 --> 02:04:11,970
去摆脱那个黑影，妈妈
to get rid of that shadow, mama.

2402
02:04:11,970 --> 02:04:14,210
你就像他，他早已占据你的心了
You just like him. You got him in you good.

2403
02:04:14,210 --> 02:04:15,510
别说我是他，妈妈
Don't tell me that, mama.

2404
02:04:15,510 --> 02:04:16,810
你简直就是特洛伊·马克森
You Troy Maxson all over again.

2405
02:04:16,810 --> 02:04:19,210
我不想成为特洛伊·马克森！
I don't want to be Troy Maxson!

2406
02:04:20,510 --> 02:04:22,150
我只想做我自己
I just want to be me.

2407
02:04:22,150 --> 02:04:25,150
你永远都会是你自己啊，科丽
You can't be nobody but who you are, Cory.

2408
02:04:25,150 --> 02:04:28,490
那黑影只不过是你自己制造出来的
That shadow wasn't nothing but you growing into yourself.

2409
02:04:28,490 --> 02:04:30,490
你要么早晚成为它，要么就只接受它的部份
You either got to grow into it, or cut it down to fit you,

2410
02:04:30,490 --> 02:04:32,960
但你要生活就得这样做
but that's all you got to make a life with.

2411
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:37,030
那就是唯一你要跟外面的人比较的东西
That's all you got to measure yourself against the world out there.

2412
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:40,970
你爸爸想你成为和他完全不一样的人
Your daddy wanted you to be everything he wasn't,

2413
02:04:40,970 --> 02:04:42,500
同时间
and at the same time,

2414
02:04:42,500 --> 02:04:45,240
他也想你成为他啊
he wanted you to be everything he was.

2415
02:04:45,540 --> 02:04:47,240
我不评论他是对还是错
Now, I don't know if he was right or wrong,

2416
02:04:47,240 --> 02:04:48,540
但我知道
but I do know

2417
02:04:48,540 --> 02:04:51,810
他本意是想做好事而非伤害你
he meant to do more good than he meant to do harm.

2418
02:04:53,550 --> 02:04:56,350
有时候他想碰触他人，自己也会受伤
Sometimes, when he touched, he bruised,

2419
02:04:57,120 --> 02:05:00,390
有时候他想做好事，却成了坏事
and sometimes, when he took me in his arms, he cut.

2420
02:05:07,190 --> 02:05:09,360
我最初遇见你爸爸时
When I first met your daddy,

2421
02:05:10,260 --> 02:05:12,030
我在想
I thought,

2422
02:05:12,030 --> 02:05:15,170
那是个我可以付托终身的人
"here is a man I can lay down with and make a baby."

2423
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:21,840
那就是我对他的第一个想法
That's the first thing I thought when I seen him.

2424
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:24,110
我当时想：罗斯·李
I thought, "Rose Lee,

2425
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:26,980
那是个你可以真诚相对的人
"here's a man you can open yourself up to

2426
02:05:26,980 --> 02:05:29,150
然后被他的爱填得满满的
"and be filled to bursting!

2427
02:05:30,580 --> 02:05:35,320
那是个可以把你心里空白的位置
"Here's a man that can fill up all them empty spaces

2428
02:05:35,320 --> 02:05:38,160
全都补上的人
"you been tipping around the edges of."

2429
02:05:43,300 --> 02:05:46,330
当你爸爸进门时
When your daddy walked through the house,

2430
02:05:46,330 --> 02:05:48,200
他是…
he was just

2431
02:05:49,240 --> 02:05:51,870
那么的大啊[形容他独力承担起家庭]
so big.

2432
02:05:53,310 --> 02:05:55,140
他心里全都占满了[工作]
He filled it up!

2433
02:05:57,580 --> 02:06:00,350
那是我犯下的第一个错误
That was my first mistake.

2434
02:06:00,350 --> 02:06:02,980
没让他在心里留点位置给我
Not to make him leave some room for me.

2435
02:06:03,250 --> 02:06:05,180
但
But

2436
02:06:07,320 --> 02:06:10,060
我想要个快乐的家
I wanted a house I could sing in.

2437
02:06:11,260 --> 02:06:14,630
你爸爸也给我了
And that's what your daddy gave me.

2438
02:06:14,630 --> 02:06:16,260
我不知道该怎样跟上他的步伐
I didn't know to keep up his strength,

2439
02:06:16,260 --> 02:06:18,960
我得牺牲自己
I had to give up little pieces of mine.

2440
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:24,070
我把他的生活当做是我的生活
I took on his life as mine and mixed up the pieces,

2441
02:06:24,070 --> 02:06:27,140
以致难以分辨到底那是我的，还是他的生活[成全他]
so you couldn't hardly tell which was which.

2442
02:06:29,940 --> 02:06:33,110
那是我的选择，放弃我的人生
It was my choice. My life.

2443
02:06:33,110 --> 02:06:36,180
而我根本不用那样屈就自己啊
And I didn't have to live it like that,

2444
02:06:38,180 --> 02:06:40,250
但那是我作为女人得做的
but that's what life offered me in the way of being a woman,

2445
02:06:40,250 --> 02:06:41,450
而我也接受了
and I took it.

2446
02:06:43,660 --> 02:06:46,630
我全然接受了
I grabbed it with both hands.

2447
02:06:46,630 --> 02:06:49,930
当撒霏儿来到我们家里时
And by the time Raynell came into the house...

2448
02:06:54,670 --> 02:06:59,170
我不想从别人的不幸上得到快乐
I didn't want to make my blessings off of nobody's misfortune,

2449

我想要但却从没有过的孩子

就像我可以取回我原本的人生，即使那么一点也好
Like I'd been blessed to relive a part of my life.

2452
02:07:15,190 --> 02:07:18,960
如果上帝认为有需要的话
And if the lord see fit to keep up my strength,

2453
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:25,030
我会像你爸爸对你那样对待她
I'm gonna do her exactly how your daddy did you.

2454
02:07:28,330 --> 02:07:31,240
我会把我最好的都给她
