辣身舞

3
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,700
大家好，我是你们的朋友布鲁西
Hi, everybody. This is your cousin Brucie.

4
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,810
我们的夏日浪漫正值高潮，每个人都在热恋！
Our summer romances are in full bloom, and everybody's in love!

5
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,970
下面是四季组合演唱的一首很棒的歌
So cousins, here's a great song from the Four Seasons.

6
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,090
那是一九六三年的夏天…
That was the summer of 1963...

7
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,720
每个人都叫我“宝贝”，我却无动于衷
when everybody called me "Baby" and it didn't occur to me to mind.

8
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,770
那是在肯尼迪总统被刺杀之前…
That was before President Kennedy was shot...

9
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,800
在甲壳虫乐队到来之前…
before the Beatles came...

10
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,970
我迫不及待地要加入和平队…
when I couldn't wait to join the Peace Corps...

11
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,940
我觉得我永远找不到像我父亲一样了不起的男人
and I thought I'd never find a guy as great as my dad.

12
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,990
那年夏天我们去了凯勒曼山庄
That was the summer we went to Kellerman's.

13
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,210
西廊打乒乓球，东场打垒球
Ping-Pong in the west arcade, softball in the east diamond.

14
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,550
棒球手们都从那儿出去！
All you Sandy Koufaxes, get out there!

15
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,080
免费舞蹈课在凉亭那边

16
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,790
哦，天哪！看那儿！
Oh, my God. Look at that!

17
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:30,990
妈妈，我该把那双珊瑚色的鞋带来的，你说我已经带很多了
Mom, I should've brought the coral shoes. You said I was taking too much.

18
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,690
好吧，甜心，你应经带了十双
Well, sweetheart, you brought ten pairs.

19
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,260
但是珊瑚色的鞋才配那件衣服
But the coral shoes matched that dress.

20
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,000
这并不是悲剧
This is not a tragedy.

21
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,530
悲剧是三个人困在矿井里或者伯明翰使用警犬
A tragedy is three men trapped in a mine or police dogs used in Birmingham.

22
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,800
僧侣们自焚抗议
Monks burning themselves in protest.

23
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,270
别多嘴，宝贝
Butt out, Baby.

24
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,080
好了，十五分钟后在南边草地练习马术
Okay, we got horseshoes on the south lawn in 15 minutes!

We've got splish-splash the water class down by the lake.

26
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,820
我们有静物写生课，排球和槌球
We have the still life art class. We got volleyball and croquet.

27
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,420
对于你们这些老家伙，我们还有麻袋！
And for you older folks, we got sacks!

28
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,520
医生！
Doc!

29
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,460
马克思！
Max!

30
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,300
医生，这么多年我总算把你请上山了
Doc, after all these years I finally got you up on my mountain.

31
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,630
血压怎么样？
How's the blood pressure?

32
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,630
我想让你们的女儿知道…
I want you girls to know...

33
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,100
如果不是这个人，我恐怕已经死了
if it were not for this man, I'd be standing here dead.

34
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,370
- 比利，拿包  - 马上，医生
- Billy, get the bags.  - Right away, Doc.

35
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,640
我留了最好的小屋给你和你漂亮的女儿
I kept the best cabin for you and your beautiful girls.

36
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,550
嘿，多谢
Hey, thanks a lot.

37
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,320
你想在这儿找工作吗？
You want a job here?

38
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,550
过几分钟凉亭里有梅伦格舞课程
There's a merengue class in the gazebo in the next few minutes.

39
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,320
最棒的老师，以前是个摇滚女歌手
The greatest teacher. Used to be a Rockette.

40
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,400
这是他六年来第一次真正的假期，马克思，放松
It's his first real vacation in six years, Max. Take it easy.

41
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,330
在这儿呆三周好比呆一年
Three weeks here, it'll feel like a year.

42
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,970
一、二、三、四！踩葡萄呀踩葡萄！
One, two, three, four! Stomp those grapes and stomp some more!

43
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,210
一、二、三、四！听音乐！
One, two, three, four! Listen to the music!

44
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,680
对不起
Sorry.

45
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,510
屁股动起来，尽情晃动吧！
Move your caboose and shake it loose!

46
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,410
一、二、三、四！开火车！
One, two, three, four! Start the train!

47
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,690
来吧，男士们！跟着我围成一个圈
Come on, men! Follow me into a round robin!

48
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,990
女士们，围成内圈！
Ladies, the inner circle!

49
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,640
来吧，女士们！
Come on, ladies!

50
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,140
上天赐予你们“响葫芦”就是让你们晃动它们！
God wouldn't have given you maracas if he didn't want you to shake them!

51
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,250
好了，女士们，现在我说“停”…
Okay now, ladies, when I say "stop"...

52
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,320
你们就会找到你的梦中情人
you're gonna find the man of your dreams.

53
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,650
停！
Stop!

54
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,460
记住，他是这儿的舞王，不过只是这儿
Remember, he's the boss on the dance floor, if nowhere else.

55
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,570
妈妈，爸爸，我上主屋去转转
Mom, Dad, I'm going up to the main house to look around.

56
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,910
这里有两种服务
There are two kinds of help here.

57
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,180
你们侍应生是大学生…
You waiters are all college guys...

58
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,150
我跑到哈佛和耶鲁把你们雇来
and I went to Harvard and Yale to hire you.

59
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,190
我为什么这么做呢？为什么？
And why did I do that? Why?

60
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,390
我本不该提醒你们，这里是家庭度假的地方
I shouldn't have to remind you. This is a family place.

61
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,260
也就是说你们的手指不要碰到水里，头发不要掉到汤里…
That means you keep your fingers out of the water, hair out of the soup...

62
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,530
并且要让那些女孩玩得开心
and show the goddamn daughters a good time.

63
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,770
所有的女孩
All the daughters.

64
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,440
甚至狗
Even the dogs.

65
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,280
带她们去天台看星星
Schlepp 'em out to the terrace, show 'em the stars.

66
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,650
- 想尽办法让她们感受浪漫  - 明白了吗，伙计们？
- Romance 'em any way you want.  - Got that, guys?

67
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,710
嘿！等等！等等！
Hey, hold it! Hold it.

68
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,250
好吧，这不是娱乐员工吗
Well, if it isn't the entertainment staff.

69
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,620
听着，自作聪明的家伙，你们也有你们的规矩
Listen, wise ass, you got your own rules.

70
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,890
陪女孩跳舞，教她们曼波…
Dance with the daughters. Teach 'em the mambo...

71
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,590
恰恰，只要她们付了钱
the cha-cha, anything they pay for.

72
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,260
仅此而已
That's it.

73
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,530
没有下文了
That's where it ends.

74
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,270
不许开玩笑，不许聊天，你的手也要放老实点！
No funny business, no conversations, and keep you hands off!

75
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,840
在哪儿都一样，有些人到林子里做爱，但也不许聊天
It's the same at all these places. Some ass in the woods, but no conversation.

76
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,840
当心，罗德里格兹
Watch it, Rodriguez.

77
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,980
约翰尼，你清楚你不能把手放在哪儿？
Can you keep that straight, Johnny? What you can't lay your hands on?

78
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,190
乖乖地把你的泡菜放在每个人的盘子里，大学男生，烈酒就留给我吧
Just put your pickle on everybody's plate, college boy, and leave the hard stuff to me.

79
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,430
请坐，我给你们来点酒
Sit down and I'll get you some wine.

80
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,840
谢谢，马克思
Thank you, Max.

81
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,880
这是豪斯曼医生和豪斯曼太太
This is Dr. And Mrs. Houseman.

82
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,010

These people are my special guests. Give them anything they want.

85
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,790
- 请慢用  - 谢谢，马克思
- Enjoy.  - Thanks, Max.

86
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,700
看看这些残羹剩饭，欧洲还有饥饿儿童吗？
Look at all this leftover food. Are there still starving children in Europe?

87
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,500
- 试试东南亚，妈妈  - 对
- Try Southeast Asia, Ma.  - Right.

88
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,170
罗比，宝贝想把她剩下的跞馑偷健
Robbie, Baby wants to send her leftover pot roast...

89
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,370
东南亚，所有吃不完的东西都打包吧
to Southeast Asia, so anything you don't finish, wrap up.

90
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,910
马克思，我们的宝贝要改变世界
Max, our Baby's gonna change the world.

91
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:48,350
- 大小姐，你你准备怎么做呢？ - 丽萨将装饰这个世界
- And what are you gonna do, Missy?  - Lisa's gonna decorate it.

92
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,520
她已经做到了
She already does.

93
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,460
医生，我想让你们见一个人，我的孙子，尼尔

哦，真棒
Oh, great.

97
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,240
你打算读英文吗？
Are you going to major in English?

98
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,780
不，第三世界经济
No. Economics of underdeveloped countries.

99
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,250
- 我要加入和平队  - 最后一场演出之后…
- I'm going into the Peace Corps.  - After the final show...

哦，他们是舞者

他们在这儿是让客人开心的
They're here to keep the guests happy.

106
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,530
他们不应该互相炫耀，这样人们会不去上课的
They shouldn't show off with each other. That's not gonna sell lessons.

107
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,020
- 嗨，孩子们，玩得好吗？ - 是的
- Hi, kids. Having fun?  - Yeah.

108
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,950

Actually, I've gotta excuse myself. I'm in charge of the games tonight.

109

她当然愿意

这只会让你疼一小会儿，你买过蓝十字保险了，对吧？
This'll only hurt for a minute. You've got Blue Cross, right?

112
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,810
感觉不错吧？
Was that good for you?

113
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,480
为了这么有趣的游戏，奖给你！
And for being such a good sport, here you go!

114
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,960
我终于遇到了跟我妈一模一样的女孩
I finally met a girl exactly like my mother.

115
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,130
穿得像她，动作像她，所以我把她带回家
Dresses like her, acts like her. So I brought her home.

116
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,130
我爸爸却不喜欢她！
My father doesn't like her!

117
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,700
想像一下吧
Go figure.

118
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,940
职工宿舍，客人勿进

119
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,320
- 嗨  - 你怎么到这儿来？
- Hi.  - How'd you get here?

120
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,990
- 我在散步  - 回去
- I was taking a walk.  - Go back.

121
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,030
我来帮你吧，那里在干什么？
Let me help you. What's up there?

122
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,030
客人勿进，这是规矩
No guests allowed. House rules.

123
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:32,570
你为什么不回表演厅呢？我看见你和小老板跳舞
Why don't you go back to the playhouse? I saw you dancing with little boss man.

124
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,370
你能别说出去吗？
Can you keep a secret?

125
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,210
你的父母会杀了你
Your parents would kill you.

126
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,210
马克思会杀了我
Max would kill me.

127
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,640
他们在哪儿学的？
Where'd they learn to do that?

128
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,570
哪儿？
Where?

129
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,640
不知道，孩子们回家后就在地下室里这么跳
I don't know. Kids are doing it in their basements back home.

130
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,910
想试试吗？
Wanna try it?

131
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,680
来吧，宝贝
Come on, Baby.

132
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,790
你能想像在专门跳狐步舞的主屋一楼…
Can you imagine dancing like this on the main floor...

133
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,290
跳这种舞吗？
home of the family fox-trot?

134
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,860
马克思非关门不可
Max would close the place down first.

135
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,260
那是我的表哥，约翰尼・卡斯尔
That's my cousin, Johnny Castle.

136
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,400
这份工作是他帮我找的
He got me the job here.

137
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,920
- 他们在一起看上去很般配  - 是的
- They look great together.  - Yeah.

138
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,420
你以为他们是情侣，是吗？
You'd think they were a couple, wouldn't you?

139
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,260
- 不是吗？ - 不，从我们小时候起就不是
- Aren't they?  - No, not since we were kids.

140
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,490
表弟，她在这儿干什么？
Yo, cousin, what's she doing here?

141
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,830
她跟我一起来的
She came with me. She's with me.

142
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,730
我抱来一个大西瓜
I carried a watermelon.

143
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,810
我抱来一个大西瓜？
I carried a watermelon?

144
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,710
膝盖弯曲，往下
Bend your knees. Down.

145
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,950
看，看着我的眼睛
Watch. Watch my eyes.

146
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,520
很好
Good.

147
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,190
好多了
That's better.

148
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,030
好，现在就这样摇动
Good. Now roll this way.

149
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,540
现在注意
Now watch.

150
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,210
看着
Look.

151
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,900
女士们，加入我们的惊悚假发秀吧
Ladies, join our hair-raising wig show.

152
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,930
试试桑德拉・狄，杰奎琳・肯尼迪…
Try your Sandra Dee, Jackie Kennedy...

153
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,740
或者伊丽莎白・泰勒的埃及艳后假发
or Elizabeth Taylor-Cleopatra wig.

154
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:13,270
- 我出三  - 真漂亮
- I'll knock with three.  - Look at that cute fella.

155
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,610
看看这双手，真是双金手
Look at these hands. They're golden hands.

156
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,280
天哪，埃及艳后！我觉得像条毒蛇
My God, it's Cleopatra! I feel like such an "asp".

157
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,620
你看起来年轻了十岁
You look ten years younger.

158
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,620
十点十五分，游泳池旁边会有健美操
At 10:15, by the pool, we have calisthenics.

159
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,960
然后拉比・毛里斯・舍尔曼将在西廊开展…
Then on the west porch, we have a symposium by Rabbi Maurice Sherman...

160
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,960
一场侮辱喜剧演员心理学的座谈会
on the psychology of insult comedians.

161
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,700
所以我说，不要问你的侍者能为你做什么
So I say, "Ask not what your waiter can do for you...

162
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,270
问问你能为你的侍者做什么
but what you can do for your waiter."

163
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,310
如果小费源源不断，我就能买辆爱快罗密欧了
If tips keep up, I'll have enough for my Alfa Romeo.

164
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,540
那是我最喜欢的车
That's my favorite car.

165
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,980
女士们，你们看起来很可爱
Ladies, you look very lovely.

166
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,950
宝贝，你今晚能不能帮我打掩护？就跟爸妈说我去休息了
Baby, would you cover for me tonight? Tell Mom and Dad I went to lie down.

167
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,790
你去哪儿？
Where are you going?

168
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:01,830
高尔夫球场，从第一棵树可以看到很美的风景
To the golf course. There's a pretty view from the first tee.

169
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,360
很好，谢谢
Good. Thanks.

170
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,670
你以前真是个摇滚歌手？
So you were really a Rockette?

171
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,810
我觉得你的舞跳得好极了
I think you're a wonderful dancer.

172
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,310
是吗？我十六岁时我妈就把我踢出了家门
Yeah? Well, my mother kicked me out when I was 16.

173
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:27,020
从此我就开始跳舞，反正这是我唯一想做的事
I've been dancing ever since. It's the only thing I ever wanted to do anyway.

174
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,320
我很羡慕你
I envy you.

175
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,220
- 你不跳吗，医生？ - 我们在等华尔兹
- Aren't you dancing, Doc?  - We're waiting for a waltz.

176
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,790
马克思，我的舞蹈课开始有成效了吗？
Hi, Max. Aren't my dance lessons starting to pay off?

177
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:07,360
你棒极了，薇薇安！非常好
You look great, Vivian! Terrific!

178
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:14,530
那是薇薇安・普莱斯曼
That's Vivian Pressman, one of the bungalow bunnies.

179
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,170
她整周都呆在这里
That's what we call the women who stay here all week.

180
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:22,910
她丈夫只有周末才来
The husbands only come up on weekends.

181
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:26,340
莫尔・普莱斯曼是个打牌高手，他将会加入我们的游戏
Moe Pressman's a big card player. He'll join our game.

182
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,750
- 莫尔星期五来吗？ - 星期五
- Moe coming up on Friday?  - Friday.

183
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,090
他老是出门，我知道
He's away a lot. I know.

184
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,390
很痛苦
It's a hardship.

185
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:47,100
佩妮在哪儿？大家都在问她呢
Where's Penny? Everybody's been asking for her.

186
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:52,540
你什么意思？佩妮在哪儿？她在休息，她需要休息
What do you mean, where's Penny? She's taking a break. She needs a break.

187
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,110
只要不是整晚的休息
As long as it's not an all-night break.

188
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,780
来吧，宝贝，我们去散散步
Come on, doll. Let's take a walk.

189
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:14,630
我喜欢看你的秀发在风中轻扬的样子
I love to watch your hair blowing in the breeze.

190
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,470
也许我父母正在找我
Maybe my parents are looking for me.

191
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,300
宝贝，不用担心
Baby, don't worry.

192
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,140
如果他们知道你跟我一起，他们会是凯勒曼山庄最开心的家长
If they think you're with me, they'll be the happiest parents at Kellerman's.

193
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,280
我得说…
I have to say it.

194
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,350
- 大家都知道我是这里的继承人  - 我知道你是
- I'm known as the catch of the county.  - I'm sure you are.

195
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,520
上周我从救生员杰米那里抢走了一个女孩
Last week I took a girl away from Jamie, the lifeguard.

196
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:41,790
他对她说：“他有什么是我没有的？”
And he said to her, "What does he have that I don't have?"

197
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:45,160
她说：“两间酒店”
And she said, "Two hotels."

198
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,330
罗比
Robbie.

199
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,230
我没有听到一声道歉
I don't hear an apology.

200
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:56,540
回到妈妈爸爸那里去，也许你会在梦中听到的
Go back to Mommy and Daddy and listen. Maybe you'll hear one in your dreams.

201
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:01,510
很抱歉你总会看到这些，宝贝
I'm sorry you had to see that, Baby.

202
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,880
有时候在这个世界上…
Sometimes in this world...

203
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,510
你会看到你不想看到的东西
you see things you don't wanna see.

204
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,020
你饿了吗？
You hungry?

205
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,520
来吧
Come on.

206
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,530
宝贝，你想吃什么？你想吃什么有什么
So, Baby, what do you want? You can have anything you want.

207
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,340
果仁巧克力饼，牛奶…
A brownie, some milk...

208
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,910
剩下的米饭布丁，甜菜…
leftover rice pudding, beets...

209
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,710
甘蓝卷…
cabbage roll...

210
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,250
水果沙拉，甜黄瓜？
fruit salad, sweet gherkins?

211
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,390
尼尔，对不起，我得去看看丽萨
Neil, look, I'm sorry. I better go check on Lisa.

212
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,220
是的
Yeah.

213
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,960
- 她怎么在那儿？ - 万一尼尔回来怎么办？
- Why's she here?  - In case Neil comes back.

214
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,090
佩妮就是不考虑后果
Penny just doesn't think.

215
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,130
她不会做傻事吧？
She wouldn't do anything stupid, would she?

216
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,700
怎么回事？她怎么了？
So, what's wrong? What's the matter with her?

217
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,240
- 她怀孕了，宝贝  - 比利！
- She's knocked up, Baby.  - Billy!

218
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,910
- 他打算怎么做？ - “他打算怎么做？”
- What's he gonna do about it?  - "What's he gonna do about it?"

219
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,240
是我的孩子，是吗？
It's mine, right?

220
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,980
- 现在你认为是我的  - 但我以为…
- Right away you think it's mine.  - But I thought...

221
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:05,300
好了，约翰尼在这儿呢
It's okay. Johnny's here.

222
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:12,310
我不会让你出任何事情的
I'm never gonna let anything happen to you.

223
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,480
我们得走了
We got to go.

224
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,990
抓住我，抓住我
Just hold on. Just hold on.

225
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,620
好孩子，好孩子
Good girl. Good girl.

226
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:33,230
你知道你在做什么吗？你有麻烦就跟我说
What do you think you're doing? You're in trouble, you talk to me.

227
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,770
我会处理的
I'll take care of it.

228
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:39,340
你应该首先来找我
You should've come to me in the first place.

229
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,810
算了吧，约翰尼，我不能拿你剩下的薪水
Forget it, Johnny. I'm not taking what's left of your salary.

230
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,810
- 佩妮，那也是我的事  - 并且那也不够用
- Penny, that's my business.  - Besides, it wouldn't be enough.

231
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:59,060
哦，天哪，完了
Oh, God, it's hopeless!

232
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,320
别这么说
Don't say that.

233
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,360
总会有解决办法的
There's gotta be a way to work it out.

234
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,330
宝贝？那是你的名字吗？
Baby? Is that your name?

235
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,000
你知道什么，宝贝？
You know what, Baby?

236
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,510
我的问题你知道个屁
You don't know shit about my problems.

237
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,680
我告诉她了
I told her.

238
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:25,220
天哪！她会告诉她的经理男友，我们都会被开除的
Jesus! She's gonna tell her management boyfriend and then we'll all get fired.

239
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,590
你干脆告诉所有人“佩妮怀了罗比的孩子”
Why not skywrite it? "Penny got knocked up by Robbie, the creep."

240
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,290
- 罗比？ - 不，宝贝
- Robbie?  - No, Baby.

241
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,360
有个顾问认识一位医生，一个真正的医学博士
One of the counselors knows a doctor, a real M. D...

242
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:39,430
他下周某天会来新帕尔兹
just traveling through New Paltz one day next week.

243
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:42,300
我们可以预约，但这得花两百五十美元
We can get an appointment, but it costs $250.

244
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:46,000
不过既然是罗比，应该没问题，我知道他有钱
But if it's Robbie, there's no problem. I know he has the money.

245
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:48,540
- 我敢肯定如果你告诉他…  - 他知道
- I'm sure if you tell him...  - He knows.

246
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,150
回你的婴儿床吧，宝贝
Go back to your playpen, Baby.

247
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,730
- 不需要你来告诉我什么是对的  - 你不能丢下她不管
- Why should you tell me what's right?  - You can't just leave her.

248
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,300
我可不想让一个暑假的努力因为一个女人而泡汤
I didn't blow a summer hauling bagels just to bail out some chick...

249
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,670
一个可能和这里每一个人上床的女人
who probably slept with every guy here.

250
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,740
更准确地说
A little precision, please.

251
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,750
有些人能上她而有些人不能
Some people count and some people don't.

252
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,580
读读这个
Read it.

253
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,320
我想你会喜欢的，但是得还我，我在里面做了笔记
I think you'll enjoy it. But return it. I have notes in there.

254
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,860
你让我觉得很恶心，离我远点
You make me sick. Stay away from me.

255
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,230
离我妹妹远点，否则我会让你被解雇的
Stay away from my sister or I'll have you fired.

256
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,520
我哪里不对了？
What am I doing wrong?

257
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,520
你打得太高了，玛姬
You're lining it up a little wrong, Marge.

258
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,890
如果你妈有一天离开了我，她肯定是去找阿诺德・帕尔默了
If your mother ever leaves me, it'll be for Arnold Palmer.

259
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:12,790
- 爸爸，有人遇到麻烦了  - 除了你妈还有别人？
- Daddy, someone's in trouble.  - Besides your mother?

260
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,960
你矫枉过正了，玛姬
You're overcorrecting, Marge.

261
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:19,470
你总是告诉我如果有人遇到麻烦，我应该帮忙
You always told me if someone was in trouble, I should help.

262
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,470
你能借我两百五十美元吗？
Could you lend me $250?

263
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:25,210
你没事吧？你遇到麻烦了吗？
Are you all right? Are you in trouble?

264
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,280
不，不是我，你能借我吗？
No, it's not me. Could you loan it to me?

265
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,910
这可不是一笔小钱，用来干什么？
That's a lot of money. What's it for?

266
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:33,110
宝贝，站直
Baby, stand up straight.

267
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,050
我不能告诉你
I can't tell you.

268
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:39,390
这么跟你说话让我很为难，但我不能告诉你
It's hard for me to say that to you, but I can't.

269
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,220
你总是说你什么都可以告诉我
You always said you could tell me anything.

270
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,660
这件事我不能告诉你
I can't tell you this.

271
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,160
不是违法的事情吧？
It's not illegal, is it?

272
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,500
不是，爸爸
No, Daddy.

273
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:58,910
这么问真愚蠢，原谅我
That was a stupid thing to ask. Forgive me.

274
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,510
我晚饭之前给你
I'll have it for you before dinner.

275
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,180
- 没出什么事吧？ - 没事
- Is everything all right?  - Fine.

276
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,180
谢谢，爸爸
Thanks, Daddy.

277
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,250
给你钱
Here's the money.

278
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:14,980
- 罗比给的？ - 不，你对他的判断是对的
- You mean Robbie?  - No. You were right about him.

279
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,590
- 那你从哪儿拿的？ - 你说你需要钱
- Then where'd you get it?  - You said you needed it.

280
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:23,190
- 这孩子是说真的吗？ - 找爸爸要钱救济他人
- Is this kid for real?  - Takes a real saint to ask Daddy.

281
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,870
谢谢，宝贝，但我不能用它
Thanks, Baby, but I can't use it.

282
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,110
什么？你怎么了？你应该收下的
What? What's the matter with you? You should take the money.

283
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:42,580
我只能帮她约在星期四
I can only get her an appointment for Thursday.

284
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,950
他们星期四在秋沙鸭有表演
They do their act at the Sheldrake Thursday.

285
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,850
如果他们取消，他们就拿不到这一季的工资，明年的演出机会也没了
If they cancel, they lose this season's salary and next year's gig.

286
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,490
秋沙鸭是什么？
What's the Sheldrake?

287
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:54,590
另一家酒店，他们在那儿跳曼波
It's another hotel where they do their mambo act.

288
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,330
别人代替她去不行吗？
Can't someone else fill in?

289
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,300
不，别人不行
No, "Miss Fix-it." Somebody else can't.

290
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:04,470
玛丽亚整天都得工作，她学不会的
Maria has to work all day. She can't learn the routines.

291
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,640
珍妮特得接替佩妮，每个人都得在这儿工作
And Janet has to fill in for Penny. Everybody works here.

292
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,310
你想去吗？从“赛门说”游戏里挤出时间来？
You wanna do it? Take time out from "Simon Says"?

293
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,710
这主意不错
It's not a bad idea.

294
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,150
我开玩笑的
It was a joke.

295
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,690
- 她会跳  - 这是我听过的最愚蠢的主意
- She can move.  - It's the dumbest idea I ever heard of.

296
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,190
- 我连梅伦格舞都不会跳  - 看见了吧？
- I can't even do the merengue.  - See?

297
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,830
你是个强大的舞伴，你能带任何人跳舞
You're a strong partner. You can lead anybody.

298
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:31,630
她连梅伦格舞都不会跳，她做不到的
She can't even do the merengue. She cannot do it.

299
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,270
- 不！ - 哦，对不起，对不起
- No!  - Oh, sorry. Sorry.

300
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,870
你别踩在一拍上
You don't step on the one.

301
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,710
你要从二拍开始，明白吗？
You gotta start on the two. Find the two. Understand?

302
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:50,280
- 我以前从没跳过这样的舞  - 是一、二、三、四
- I never did any of these dances before.  - It's one, two, three, four.

303
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,090
音乐开始后，到二的时候你才开始跳，明白吗？
When the music starts, you don't dance until the two. Got it?

304
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,190
放松，放松
Relax, relax.

305
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,020
深呼吸
Breathe.

306
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,360
姿势
Frame.

307
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,030
不
Nope.

308
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,040
再来
Again.

309
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:12,070
噢
Ow.

310
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:15,210
二、三、四，二、三、四
Two, three, four. Two, three, four.

311
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,910
不要向后靠，挺起胸来
Don't lean back. Lifting up.

312
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,380
二、三、四，肩膀向下压
Two, three, four. Shoulders down.

313
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,690
再来，集中注意力，还有…
Again. Concentrate. And...

314
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:12,330
脚跟不要着地
Don't put your heel down.

315
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,200
- 脚跟不要着地  - 我没有…
- Don't put your heel down.  - I didn't...

316
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,740
脚尖着地，听我的
Stay on the toe. Just listen to me.

317
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:20,110
这些步子还不够
The steps aren't enough.

318
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:22,210
感受音乐
Feel the music.

319
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:47,300
不在一拍，这不是曼波
It's not on the one. It's not the mambo.

320
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:50,410
这是一种感觉，一种心跳
It's a feeling, a heartbeat.

321
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:59,580
不要那么用力
Don't try so hard.

322
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,950
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

323
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,160
二、三、四，二、三、四
Two, three, four. Two, three, four.

324
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,800
深呼吸
Breathe.

325
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:35,420
抬头，保持姿势，保持
Head up. Lock your frame. Lock it.

326
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,420
看，面条胳膊
Look, spaghetti arm.

327
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:41,560
这是我的跳舞空间，这是你的跳舞空间
This is my dance space. This is your dance space.

328
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:45,090
井水不犯河水，你要保持姿势
I don't go into yours. You don't go into mine. You gotta hold the frame.

329
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,000
再来
Again.

330
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,630
姿势
Frame.

331
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,210
后退，放松
Back. Easy.

332
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:50,580
旋转，旋转，上，下，你以后会学这个的
And turn, turn. Down. And lift. You'll learn that later.

333
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,550
来吧
And come on.

334
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,590
向下，扭转
Down. Twist.

335
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,260
弯腰
And the bow.

336
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,290
- 对不起，对不起  - 你想杀了我吗？
- Sorry. Sorry.  - You trying to kill me?

337
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:03,630
你得集中注意力！你觉得很好玩吗？
You gotta concentrate! Is that your idea of fun?

338
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,970
事实上是的
As a matter of fact it is.

339
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,940
我们还有两天就要上场了，你却还不教我跳跃，我还没学会旋转
We do the show in two days, you won't show me lifts, I'm not sure of turns.

340
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:13,610
我做这些都是为了救你们，我真想把你摔到地上
I'm doing all this to save your ass, but I'd rather drop you on it!

341
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:16,940
我们出去吧
Let's get out of here.

342
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,390
该死！
Shit!

343
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,020
我把钥匙锁在车里了！
I locked the keys in the car!

344
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,880
你淋湿了，对吧？
You're getting wet, right?

345
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,500
- 你真疯狂  - 什么？
- You're wild.  - What?

346
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:11,730
你真疯狂！
You're wild!

347
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:45,230
现在，跳跃中需要记住最重要的事情是平衡
Now, the most important thing to remember in lifts is balance.

348
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,000
哇！哇！
Whoa! Whoa!

349
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,750
我现在做到了
I got it now.

350
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:58,750
你在哪儿学的跳舞？
So where'd you learn to be a dancer?

351
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,850
一天一个人走进一家小餐馆…
Well, this guy came into this luncheonette one day and...

352
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,120
我们都在那儿坐着无所事事
we were all sitting around doing nothing.

353
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:10,760
他说亚曼瑞在招老师
And he said that Arthur Murray was giving a test for instructors.

354
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,130
如果你通过了…
So, if you passed...

355
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:22,140
他们会教你跳不同的舞，教你怎么分解动作再教给别人
they teach you different dances, show you how to break them down, teach them.

356
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,140
什么？
What?

357
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,750
很好
Good.

358
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,760
不要往下看，看这里，很好
Don't look down. Look here. Good.

359
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:44,530
然后…
And...

360
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,670
现在膝盖弯曲，然后往上跳，跳，跳
Now, bend your knees and go up. Go, go.

361
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,750
不错，现在如果你不信任我，你就会伤到我
Good try. Now, you'll hurt me if you don't trust me, all right?

362
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,750
现在，跳，跳，跳
Now, go, go. Go.

363
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,550
很好，现在跳吧
Good. Now, I'm gonna go up.

364
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:53,060
知道吗，练习跳跃最好的地方是水中
You know, the best place to practice lifts is in the water.

365
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,670
弯下膝盖，然后…跳
Just bend your knees. And... go.

366
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,140
很好
Good.

367
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,810
很好，很好
Good. Good.

368
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,970
保持这个姿势，保持住
Now hold the position. Hold it.

369
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,210
很好，别动！别动！
Good. Don't break! Don't break!

370
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:19,530
再来一次
Let's do it again.

371
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:26,170
好，一、二、三
All right. One, two, three.

372
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:29,230
哦，对不起
Oh, sorry.

373
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,740
很好，保持…不
Good. Keep... No, don't.

374
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:49,260
还不错
It's not too bad.

375
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:55,600
- 再来一次  - 好，在我的头上，跳
- One more time.  - Okay. Over my head. Go.

376
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,700
我不敢相信就是今晚
I can't believe it's tonight.

377
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:02,940
还有二十分钟开始，我们去车上换衣服
Sheldrake's 20 minutes away. We'll change in the car.

378
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,710
舒马赫太太，等等，我们来帮你
Mrs. Schumacher. Hey, wait, we'll help you.

379
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,450
这么多垃圾，这么多垃圾
Such junk. Such junk.

380
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:19,950
我上过贝尼・伯恩斯坦舞蹈学校
Benny Bernstein's Dancing School, that's where I went.

381
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,760
乔治・伯恩斯曾是一名老师
George Burns was a teacher.

382
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,560
- 谢谢  - 不用谢
- Thank you.  - You're welcome.

383
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,100
我只要压低我的肩，抬高我的头…
I'll just keep my shoulders down, my head up...

384
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:37,300
保持姿势，踮着脚尖…
my frame locked, stay on my toes...

385
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:39,440
如果我忘了这些步子怎么办？
What if I forget the steps?

386
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:43,040
挺胸，留心姿势，记住让他来引导你
Pull up, watch the frame. And remember, let him lead you.

387
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:47,450
我害怕我会什么都忘了，头昏眼花脸着地
I'm afraid I'm gonna forget to spike, get dizzy and fall on my face.

388
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:52,420
不，不要看我的脚，抬头睁眼…
No. Don't look at my feet, keep my head up, my eyes open...

389
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:56,460
拉紧胳膊，保持姿势，挺胸…
tension in my arms, my frame locked, seat pulled up...

390
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,490
谢谢，宝贝
Thanks, Baby.

391
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,230
我只是想让你知道我不跟人随便上床…
I just want you to know that I don't sleep around...

392
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,330
不管罗比跟你说了什么
whatever Robbie might have told you.

393
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,170
我以为他爱我
And I thought that he loved me.

394
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:13,340
我当真了
I thought it was something special.

395
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:17,350
不管怎样，我只是想然你知道
Anyway, I just wanted you to know that.

396
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:23,690
我看起来怎么样？
So, how does it look?

397
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,030
我很害怕
I'm scared.

398
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,870
我很害怕，宝贝
I'm so scared, Baby.

399
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:40,800
别担心
Don't worry.

400
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,340
你会好起来的
You'll be fine.

401
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,480
宾果！宾果！宾果！凯勒曼山庄的星期四之夜
Bingo! Bingo! Bingo! That's right. It's Thursday night at Kellerman's.

402
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:54,480
今晚是宾果之夜
That's bingo night.

403
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,290
- 嘿，待会儿跳支舞怎么样？ - 也许吧，谁知道呢？
- Hey, how about a dance later?  - Could be. Who knows?

404
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:01,720
- 丽萨，你得帮我个忙  - 我不帮
- Lisa, you have to do something for me.  - I don't have to.

405
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:06,160
就告诉爸妈我头疼休息，好吗？
Just tell Mom and Dad I have a headache and I'm in bed, okay?

406
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,230
再见
Bye.

407
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:16,370
秋沙鸭酒店隆重推出约翰尼・卡斯尔和他的舞伴…
The Sheldrake Hotel is proud to present Johnny Castle and partner...

408
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,740
表演的“曼波魔力”
in "Mambo Magic."

409
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:23,910
放松
Relax.

410
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:58,820
现在跟着我的舞步走
Now spot a lead.

411
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:29,780
走错了！
Wrong way!

412
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,960
这边
Over here.

413
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:49,330
准备好跳了吗？
Ready for the lift?

414
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:53,100
来吧
Come on.

415
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,950
继续，继续
Keep going. Keep going.

416
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:48,560
…因为无论你现在身处何方，我想让你望着天空
...because wherever you are now, I want you to look at the sky.

417
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:52,900
看着那些星星，下面是漂流者乐队
Look at those stars. What a show. Here are The Drifters.

418
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:55,900
做得不错，你很努力
You did good. You worked hard.

419
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:58,570
我看见凯勒曼的一对老夫妇，我就想，完了
I saw that old couple from Kellerman's and I thought that was it.

420
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,640
我也是，我也是
Me too. Me too.

421
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,950
知道吗，第二个旋转你真的找到感觉了
You know, by the second turn you really had it.

422
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:08,580
- 但我没做跳跃的动作  - 你做得不错
- But I didn't do the lift.  - You did real good.

423
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:12,280
谢谢
Thanks.

424
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:17,120
约翰尼！
Johnny!

425
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:19,990
快来，佩妮出事了
Come on. It's Penny.

426
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,190
- 她在等你回来  - 你叫救护车了吗？
- She wouldn't go until you returned.  - Did you call an ambulance?

427
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,960
她说医院会叫警察的，她要我答应
She said the hospital would call the police. She made me promise.

428
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,870
他连麻醉剂都没有用，什么都没用
He didn't use no ether, nothing.

429
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:35,070
- 你不是说他是个真正的医学博士吗？ - 他只有一把没有消过毒的刀和桌子
- I thought you said he was a real M.D.?  - He had a dirty knife and a table.

430
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:37,440
我在走廊里就能听见她的尖叫
I could hear her screaming in the hallway.

431
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:40,440
我发誓，我试着进去
I swear to God, I tried to get in.

432
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:45,380
没事的，约翰尼在这里
It's all right. Johnny's here.

433
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,100
什么？怎么了，宝贝？
What? What is it, Baby?

434
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,470
- 是丽萨吗？ - 不是
- Is it Lisa?  - No.

435
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:23,490
对不起，对不起！大家都请出去
Excuse me. Excuse me! Everybody clear out, please.

436
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,300
是的，我知道很疼，我们会解决的
Yes, I know that hurts. We're gonna take care of that.

437
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:44,640
- 谁对这个女孩负责？ - 我
- Who's responsible for this girl?  - I am.

438
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:47,080
求求你，她…
Please, is she...

439
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,760
医生，太谢谢你了
Doc, thanks a lot.

440
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,100
我不知道如何感谢你
I don't know how to thank you.

441
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:23,610
- 我的钱就用在这儿了？ - 对不起，我没想撒谎的
- Was that what my money paid for?  - I'm sorry. I never meant to lie.

442
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,280
你不是我以为的那个人，我快不认识你了
You're not the person I thought you were. I'm not sure who you are.

443
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:29,720
我不想你再跟那些人扯上关系了
I don't want you to have anything to do with those people.

444
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:33,860
你别再和那些人来往了！
Nothing! You're to have nothing to do with them ever again!

445
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,530
我不会告诉你妈的，现在我去睡觉了
I won't tell your mother about this. Right now I'm going to bed.

446
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:40,970
在你妈看见你之前把你脸上的东西清理掉
And take that stuff off your face before your mother sees you!

447
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,810
没事吧，杰克？
Is everything all right, Jake?

448
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:51,310
没事，玛姬，回去睡觉吧
It's all right, Marge. Go back to sleep.

449
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:13,000
我可以进来吗？
Can I come in?

450
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:29,150
我想这个房间实在不怎么样，你也许有个很好的房间
I got a... I guess it's not a great room. You probably got a great room.

451
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:31,680
不，这房间不错！
No. It's a great room!

452
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,100
不要关
Leave it on.

453
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:49,240
我为我父亲对你态度道歉
I'm sorry about the way my father treated you.

454
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,740
不，你父亲很好
No. Your father was great.

455
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:57,510
他很好，他医好了佩妮
He was great. The way he took care of Penny.

456
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,650
我是说他对你的态度
I mean the way he was with you.

457
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:03,220
其实他针对的是我
It's really me it has to do with.

458
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:08,550
约翰尼我来这儿是因为我的父亲…
Johnny, I came here because my father...

459
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:12,290
不，他救了佩妮…这我永远也做不到
No. The way he saved her... I could never do anything like that.

460
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:16,360
这很了不起，人们不把我当回事是因为我的确什么都不是
That was something. People treat me like I'm nothing because I am nothing.

461
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,230
不是这样的！你是一切！
That's not true! You're everything!

462
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,210
你不明白像我这种人的感受
You don't understand the way it is for somebody like me.

463
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:27,470
上个月我吃糖充饥
Last month I'm eating candy to stay alive.

464
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:30,540
这个月女人们却往我的口袋里塞钻石
This month, women are stuffing diamonds in my pockets.

465
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:33,100
我站在屎的上方保持平衡而我可能再次摔到屎堆里
I'm balancing on shit and I can be down there again.

466
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:36,550
不，不是这样的！你不必这样的！
No, it's not the way it is! It doesn't have to be that way!

467
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:42,560
我从没见过像你这样的人，你觉得你能改变世界
I've never known anyone like you. You think you can make the world better.

468
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:44,690
有人不见了，你找到他们；有人留血了…
Somebody's lost, you find them. Somebody's bleeding...

469
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,630
我去找我爸爸，真的很勇敢，就像你说的
I go get my daddy. That's really brave, like you said.

470
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:51,570
这需要多大的胆子才敢去找他呀！
That took a lot of guts to go to him!

471
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,700
你什么都不怕
You are not scared of anything.

472
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:57,940
我什么都怕！我怕我看见的一切
I'm scared of everything! I'm scared of what I saw.

473
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:01,640
我怕我所做的一切，我怕我自己
I'm scared of what I did, who I am.

474
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:07,050
我害怕走出这个房间后这辈子再也感受不到…
I'm scared of walking out of here and never feeling for the rest of my life...

475
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,350
和你在一起的那种感觉！
the way I feel when I'm with you!

476
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:33,010
和我跳支舞吧
Dance with me.

477
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:36,910
什么，这儿？
What, here?

478
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:38,650
这儿
Here.

479
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:41,970
歌手、舞者、演员们，今天是你们的幸运日！
Singers, dancers, actors, this is your lucky day!

480
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:45,440
年度凯勒曼季末才艺表演的试镜…
Auditions for the annual Kellerman end-of-the-season talent show...

481
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,540
在表演厅里开始
beginning in the playhouse.

482
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:57,220
- 大家都去参加表演吗？ - 我们明天就走
- So everyone gonna be in the show?  - We're leaving tomorrow.

483
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:59,420
以避开周末塞车
Miss the weekend traffic.

484
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,390
但是我们付了一直到周日的钱
But we're paid up 'til Sunday.

485
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:04,420
- 不参加表演了吗？ - 我说了明天就走
- And miss the show?  - I said we're leaving tomorrow.

486
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:07,530
- 我要在表演里唱歌  - 这可是个盛大的活动
- I was going to sing in the show.  - It's the big event.

487
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,930
人们带来了他们的绝活，你不想错过的
People bring their own arrangements. You don't want to miss it.

488
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:12,030
宝贝，我需要你做道具
Baby, I need you for props.

489
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:16,740
你为什么想提前离开？
Why would you want to leave early?

490
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:26,550
我只是想想，你想的话我们就留下来吧
It was just an idea. We can stay if you want to.

491
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:33,850
- 那么你打算唱什么？ - 《I Feel Pretty》
- So, what were you planning to sing?  - "I Feel Pretty."

492
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,920
或者《What Do the Simple Folk Do？》
Or "What Do the Simple Folk Do?"

493
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,760
或者《I Feel Pretty》，你觉得怎么样，爸爸？
Or "I Feel Pretty." What do you think, Daddy?

494
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:54,210
你看起来好多了
You look much better.

495
01:00:56,910 --> 01:01:00,450
你父亲刚刚来过，他是个很好的人
You just missed your father. He's such a wonderful man.

496
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,890
对不起，我没意识到…
I'm sorry. I didn't realize...

497
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:07,290
你不可能意识到的，没关系
You couldn't have. It's okay.

498
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:22,100
- 你怎么样？ - 我很好
- So, how you doin'?  - I'm okay.

499
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:26,140
豪斯曼医生说我会好的
Dr. Houseman says I'm going to be fine.

500
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:31,280
- 我还能生孩子  - 哦，佩妮，真棒
- I can still have children.  - Oh, Penny, that's really great.

501
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:36,620
昨晚怎么样？
So, how did it go last night?

502
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:38,650
很好
Good.

503
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:44,460
很好，我没做跳跃动作，但还好
Fine. I didn't do the lifts, but it was good.

504
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:59,880
好了，我想我该走了
Well, I guess I gonna go.

505
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,680
再见
See ya.

506
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:14,060
- 他说你会好的是吗？ - 你在做什么？
- So, he says you're going to be fine?  - What are you doing?

507
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,590
- 我会告诉马克思你的奶奶去世了  - 我告诉过你多少次…
- I'll tell Max your grandmother died.  - How many times have you told me...

508
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:20,430
不要和他们纠缠不清？
never get mixed-up with them?

509
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:22,430
我知道我在做什么
I know what I'm doing.

510
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:27,300
你听我说，你现在就得停止
You listen to me. You've got to stop it now.

511
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:46,460
我得赶紧走了，我得去教克莱默夫妇跳舞
Look, I gotta run. I got a lesson with the Kramers.

512
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,930
如果我不在那儿，他们会杀了对方的
They'll kill each other if I'm not there.

513
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:51,430
好吧，当然，你得走了
Well, sure. You've gotta go.

514
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:55,630
再见
I'll see ya.

515
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:18,090
现在是雨天游戏时间，给客人们别上尾巴
It's rainy day game time. Pin the tail on the guest.

516
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:20,590
赢取十盒克里内克丝面巾纸或者一头公山羊！
Win ten boxes of Kleenex or a billy goat!

517
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:25,130
天哪，我烦死这场雨了
God, I am so sick of this rain.

518
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:27,930
这提醒我不要去尼亚加拉大瀑布度蜜月
Remind me not to take my honeymoon at Niagara Falls.

519
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,140
那你就去阿卡普尔科吧
So, you go to Acapulco. It'll be fine.

520
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,840
我的米黄色闪光唇膏呢？
Where is my beige iridescent lipstick?

521
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:37,110
我知道我把它放在抽屉里了
I know I put it in this drawer.

522
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:39,410
宝贝，这种天气你要去哪儿？
Baby, where are you going in this weather?

523
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,080
呃，西厅有看手势猜字谜游戏
Uh, they're having charades in the west lobby.

524
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:45,080
真是个社团活跃分子
Quite the little joiner, aren't we?

525
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:03,230
- 你有过很多女人吗？ - 什么？
- Have you had many women?  - What?

526
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,840
宝贝，说吧
Baby, come on.

527
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:09,840
告诉我，我想知道
Tell me. I want to know.

528
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:23,820
你得明白这是怎么一回事
You gotta understand what it's like.

529
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:26,330
你从街上走来然后突然出现在这里
You come from the streets and suddenly you're up here.

530
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:30,300
女人们投怀送抱，散发着香味
Women are throwing themselves at you and they smell so good.

531
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,470
她们自己照顾自己
They really take care of themselves.

532
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:34,970
我从来不知道女人可以那样
I never knew women could be like that.

533
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:38,300
她们那么有钱，你觉得她们什么都了解
They're so goddamn rich you think they must know about everything.

534
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:41,070
她们往我手里塞她们房间的钥匙，一天两三次…
They're slippin' their room keys in my hand two and three times a day...

535
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:45,340
不同的女人…我觉得我很走运
different women... so, I think I'm scorin' big, right?

536
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:49,850
你觉得要是她们不在乎我，就不会做这些事，对吗？
You think, "They wouldn't be doing this if they didn't care about me, right?"

537
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:54,020
没关系，我明白，你只是在利用她们
That's all right. I understand. You were just using them, that's all.

538
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:57,460
不，不是这样的
No, that's not it.

539
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,660
问题是并非如此
That's the thing. It wasn't like that.

540
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,870
她们在利用我
They were using me.

541
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:34,360
你真正的名字是什么，宝贝？
What's your real name, Baby?

542
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:40,530
弗朗西丝，与美国内阁第一位女性成员同名
Frances, for the first woman in the Cabinet.

543
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:46,110
弗朗西丝，真是个成熟的名字
Frances. That's a real grownup name.

544
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:01,720
我决定跟罗宾做爱了
I've decided to go all the way with Robbie.

545
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:08,000
不，别跟像他那样的人
No, not with someone like him.

546
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:12,430
你觉得我们十周年的时候回来会是免费的吗？
Do you think if we came back for a ten-year anniversary, it would be free?

547
01:06:12,530 --> 01:06:16,000
这样是不对的，你应该…
It's just wrong this way. It should be with someone...

548
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:20,710
和你喜欢的人才对
With someone that you sort of love.

549
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:24,980
算了吧，你一点也不在乎我
Come on. You don't care about me.

550
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:28,080
即使我和整个军队的人上床你也无所谓…
You wouldn't care if I humped the entire army...

551
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:31,320
只要我们在胡志明小道的右方
as long as we were on the right side of the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

552
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:36,260
你在乎的是你不再是爸爸的小女孩了
What you care about is that you're not Daddy's girl anymore.

553
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:38,760
他现在听我说话
He listens when I talk now.

554
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,300
你嫉妒
You hate that.

555
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:01,220
二、三，恰、恰、恰！
Two, three, cha-cha-cha.

556
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:04,190
我的姿势，我优美的弧线在哪儿呢？
My frame. Where's my pleasing arc?

557
01:07:04,290 --> 01:07:07,820
面条胳膊！你能让我拉紧一点吗？
Spaghetti arms! Would you give me some tension, please?

558
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:13,060
你在侵占我的跳舞空间，这是我的跳舞空间
You're invading my dance space. This is my dance space.

559
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:15,530
那才是你的，我们恰恰
That's yours. Let's cha-cha.

560
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:24,370
不要往下看，看这里
Don't look down. Look right here.

561
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:38,050
- 你怎么叫你心爱的男孩？ - 到这儿来，心爱的男孩
- How you call your lover boy?  - Come here, lover boy.

562
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:41,690
- 如果他不回答呢？ - 哦，心爱的男孩
- And if he doesn't answer?  - Oh, lover boy.

563
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:45,160
- 如果他还不回答呢？ - 我就说…
- And if still doesn't answer?  - I simply say...

564
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,960
宝贝
Baby

565
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:50,870
哦，宝贝
O-Oh, baby

566
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:54,800
我亲爱的宝贝
My sweet baby

567
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,810
你是我的
You're the one

568
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:14,690
在上舞蹈课吗？
Takin' dance lessons?

569
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:17,700
我可以教你，孩子
I could teach ya, kid.

570
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,370
我爷爷让我负责最后的表演
My grandfather put me in charge of the final show.

571
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:27,740
我想跟你谈谈最后的舞蹈
I want to talk to you about the last dance.

572
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:30,910
我想来点刺激的
I'd like to shake things up a bit.

573
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:33,610
你知道，与时俱进的
You know, move with the times.

574
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:35,710
我有很多想法
I've got a lot of ideas.

575
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:37,880
我和员工们一直在努力…
I've been working with the staff kids...

576
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:41,450
将古巴韵律和灵魂舞蹈融合在一起
on a cross between a Cuban rhythm and soul dancing.

577
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:44,320
喂，伙计
Whoa, boy.

578
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,660
你没理解我的意思
Way over your head here.

579
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:50,730
你们总是跳曼波，是吧？
You always do the mambo, huh?

580
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:54,030
今年最后的舞蹈为什么不跳…
Why not dance this year's final dance...

581
01:08:56,070 --> 01:08:57,940
泼格舞？
to the pachenga?

582
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:00,240
好
Right.

583
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:06,140
好吧，如果你想的话你也可以跳跟去年一样的…
Well, you're free to do the same, tired number as last year if you want...

584
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:09,150
但是明年我们会找一个新的舞者…
but next year we'll find another dance person...

585
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:11,620
- 他会欣然接受的…  - 好吧，尼尔，没问题
- who'll only be too happy...  - Sure, Neil. No problem.

586
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:15,990
季末我们会跳泼格舞的
We'll end the season with the pachenga.

587
01:09:16,090 --> 01:09:17,520
不错
Great idea.

588
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:28,470
有时候很难与他谈话，但女士们似乎很喜欢他
Sometimes he's hard to talk to, but the ladies seem to like him.

589
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,500
一定要让他给你上足半小时的课，你付了钱的
See that he gives you the full half-hour you're paying him for, kid.

590
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:43,450
那小子根本不懂舞蹈的创新
That little wimp. He wouldn't know a new idea if it hit him in the pachenga.

591
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,820
我可以告诉他一些新想法的
I could have told him some new ideas.

592
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,920
你怎么能让他那样和你说话？
Why did you let him talk to you that way?

593
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:50,460
- 什么，难道跟老板斗嘴吗？ - 你就告诉他你的想法
- What, fight the boss man?  - You tell him your ideas.

594
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,330
- 他也和别人一样  - 瞧，我了解这种人
- He's a person like everyone else.  - Look, I know these people.

595
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:56,100
富有而刻薄，他们不会听我的
They are rich and they're mean. They won't listen to me.

596
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,560
为什么不更努力地争取呢？让他们听见你的声音
Why not fight harder? Make them listen.

597
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:01,530
因为我需要这份该死的工作一直持续到明年夏天
Because I need this goddamned job lined up for next summer.

598
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,700
我爸爸今天打电话给我
My dad calls me today.

599
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,410
“好消息，”他说，“保罗叔叔，终于帮你在工会找了份差事”
"Good news," he says. "Uncle Paul can finally get you in the union."

600
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:08,740
什么工会？
What union?

601
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:13,850
家庭油漆工与水泥工，一七九号为您服务
The House Painters and Plasterers Local Number 179 at your service.

602
01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:24,530
我一直在思考骨牌理论
I've been thinking a lot about the Domino Theory.

603
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:26,960
现在如果越南失败了，中国是下一个吗？
Now, when Viet Nam falls, is China Next?

604
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,700
他们应该没看见我们
I don't think they saw us.

605
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,340
更努力地争取，是吗？
Fight harder, huh?

606
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:49,150
我没看见你努力争取，告诉你爸爸我是你的男人
I don't see you fightin' so hard, tellin' Daddy I'm your guy.

607
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:51,390
我会的，我爸爸的情况比较复杂
I will. With my father, it's complicated.

608
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:53,890
- 我会告诉他的  - 我不相信你，宝贝
- I will tell him.  - I don't believe you, Baby.

609
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,030
我觉得…
I don't think...

610
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:03,330
你并没有告诉他的打算
that you ever had any intention of telling him.

611
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,530
从来没有
Ever.

612
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:19,410
好了，朋友们，快结束了，劳动节的周末到了
Well, Cousin, it's almost over. Labor Day weekend is here.

613
01:11:19,450 --> 01:11:23,180
很快就要回到书本和工作中了，真可怕！
Soon it's back to the old books and back to work. What a terrible thought!

614
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:34,900
你看见约翰尼了吗？
Have you seen Johnny?

615
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:51,980
对不起
I'm sorry.

616
01:11:56,450 --> 01:11:58,390
看来我在两姐妹中选错了人
Looks like I picked the wrong sister.

617
01:11:58,450 --> 01:12:01,260
没关系，宝贝，我也去过贫民窟
That's okay, Baby. I went slummin' too.

618
01:12:19,110 --> 01:12:20,780
打我啊
Hit me.

619
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:29,820
从这儿滚出去，你不配
Get out of here. You're not worth it.

620
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:30,210
大赢一笔，莫尔
Win big, Moe.

621
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:31,550
像往常一样
As always.

622
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:52,940
这是我们在一起的最后一夜了，亲爱的，我为我们做了点安排
This is our last night together, lover. I've got something worked out for us.

623
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:17,900
对不起，先生，下一个是海盗号码
Excuse me, sir. The pirate number's next.

624
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:20,270
哦，谢谢，嘿，孩子
Oh, thanks. Hey, kid.

625
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:23,070
我整个周末都在玩牌，今天还得玩一整晚
I've been playing cards all weekend and I've got an all-night game tonight.

626
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:26,640
你为什么不给我妻子多上点舞蹈课呢？
Why don't you give my wife some extra dance lessons?

627
01:14:35,710 --> 01:14:37,620
对不起，普莱斯曼先生…
I'm sorry, Mr. Pressman...

628
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:40,190
我整个周末都得忙着排练节目
but I'm booked up for the whole weekend with the show.

629
01:14:40,290 --> 01:14:42,490
没有时间做别的
I won't have time for anything else.

630
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:45,760
我想我不该收下这些钱
I don't think it'd be fair to take the money.

631
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:13,350
我决定今晚就和罗比在一起
I've decided tonight's the night with Robbie.

632
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:15,590
他还不知道呢
He doesn't even know yet.

633
01:15:51,330 --> 01:15:52,560
是我
It's me.

634
01:15:57,730 --> 01:15:59,070
妈的！
Holy shit!

635
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,220
你想听些疯狂的事情吗？
You wanna hear somethin' crazy?

636
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,030
昨晚我…
Last night I...

637
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:33,470
我梦见我们一起散步，遇见了你爸爸
I dreamt we were walking along and we met your father.

638
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:36,200
他说，“来吧，”然后用胳膊揽着我
He said, "Come on," and he put his arm around me.

639
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:40,010
就像对罗比那样
Just like he did with Robbie.

640
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:32,530
当你看见一个病人觉得他没事，可你一看X光片…
You know how you feel when you see a patient and you think he's all right...

641
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:35,600
却发现和你想的完全不同，你会有什么感觉？
then you look at the X rays and it's nothing like you thought?

642
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:36,900
发生什么事了？
What happened?

643
01:17:36,970 --> 01:17:40,440
这就好像你发现你的员工竟是一个小偷
It's exactly what it's like when you find out one of your staff's a thief.

644
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:44,140
莫尔・普莱斯曼昨晚玩牌的时候钱包被偷了
Moe Pressman's wallet was stolen when he was playing pinochle last night.

645
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:47,240
钱包放在挂在椅背上的外套里
It was in his jacket hanging on the back of his chair.

646
01:17:47,310 --> 01:17:51,550
他一点半放在那里，四点时他又看了一下…
He had it at 1:30 and when he checked again at quarter of 4:00...

647
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:54,020
钱包却不见了
it was missing.

648
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:58,620
薇薇安说她记得那个跳舞的小子，约翰尼…
Vivian thinks she remembers this dance kid Johnny...

649
01:17:58,690 --> 01:17:59,960
从旁边路过
walking by.

650
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:04,930
我们就问他，“你有昨晚不在场的证据吗？”
So we ask him, "You have an alibi for last night?"

651
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:07,200
他说他在房间里独自看书
He says he was alone in his room reading.

652
01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:11,000
约翰尼房里根本没有书！
There are no books in Johnny's room!

653
01:18:12,970 --> 01:18:15,040
一定有什么误会，我知道不是约翰尼干的
There's been a mistake. I know Johnny didn't do it.

654
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:17,570
秋沙鸭酒店也有类似的小偷，这儿以前也发生过
There's been similar thefts at the Sheldrake. It's happened here before.

655
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:20,010
- 三个钱包  - 我知道不是他干的
- Three other wallets.  - I know he didn't do it.

656
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:22,180
别管这事，宝贝
Stay out of it, Baby.

657
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:26,120
等等，别把那些桌子放在一起
Wait. Don't put those tables together. Come on.

658
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:32,420
爸爸，我需要你的帮助，我知道约翰尼没有偷莫尔的钱包
Daddy, I need your help. I know Johnny didn't take Moe's wallet.

659
01:18:32,490 --> 01:18:34,860
- 哦？你怎么知道？ - 我不能告诉你
- Oh? How do you know?  - I can't tell you.

660
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:39,730
- 请相信我，爸爸  - 对不起，宝贝，我不能
- Just please trust me, Daddy.  - I'm sorry, Baby. I can't.

661
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:41,900
这块丹麦蛋糕富含蛋白质
This Danish is pure protein.

662
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:48,440
也许不是约翰尼干的，谁都可能偷了钱包
Maybe Johnny didn't do it. Anyone could've taken it.

663
01:18:48,510 --> 01:18:50,440
也许是…
Maybe it was, uh...

664
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:53,380
也许是那对个子小小的老夫妇，舒马赫夫妇
It could've been that little, old couple, the Schumachers.

665
01:18:53,450 --> 01:18:56,680
- 我看到她拿着几个钱包  - 西尔维娅和西德尼？
- I saw her with a couple of wallets.  - Sylvia and Sidney?

666
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:59,780
宝贝，你不能随便冤枉无辜的人
Baby, you don't go around accusing innocent people.

667
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:04,360
我还在秋沙鸭酒店看见他们了，你说那儿也有人被偷
I even saw them at the Sheldrake. You said something was stolen from there.

668
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:08,030
我有目击证人，而那个小子没有不在场证据
I got an eyewitness and the kid has no alibi.

669
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:12,030
来吧，尼尔，你来学学如何解雇你的员工
Come on, Neil. You'll learn what it's like to fire an employee.

670
01:19:13,230 --> 01:19:16,730
等一下，我知道约翰尼没偷钱包
Wait a minute. I know Johnny didn't take the wallet.

671
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,040
我知道，因为他昨晚一直在他房间里
I know because he was in his room all night.

672
01:19:20,110 --> 01:19:24,610
我知道是因为我当时和他在一起
And the reason I know is because I was with him.

673
01:19:49,030 --> 01:19:50,940
我跟你说过我说的是实话
I told you I was telling the truth.

674
01:19:55,810 --> 01:19:57,780
对不起，我对你撒了谎
I'm sorry I lied to you.

675
01:20:00,650 --> 01:20:02,620
但你也撒了谎
But you lied too.

676
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:08,390
你告诉我每个人都是一样的，都理应受到公平的对待
You told me everyone was alike and deserved a fair break.

677
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:10,560
但你指的是像你一样的人
But you meant everyone who is like you.

678
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:16,560
你告诉我你想要我改变世界，让它更美好
You told me you wanted me to change the world, to make it better.

679
01:20:17,630 --> 01:20:20,270
但你指的是成为一名律师或者经济学家…
But you meant by becoming a lawyer or an economist...

680
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:22,470
嫁给一个哈佛毕业生
and marrying someone from Harvard.

681
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:27,670
我并不为自己感到骄傲
I'm not proud of myself.

682
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:31,280
但我也是这个家庭的一员，你不能一直用沉默对待我
But I'm in this family too. You can't keep giving me the silent treatment.

683
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:37,650
我有很多事情都不是你想像的那样
There are a lot of things about me that aren't what you thought.

684
01:20:38,690 --> 01:20:41,660
但如果你爱我，你就得爱我的一切
But if you love me, you have to love all the things about me.

685
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,260
而我爱你
And I love you.

686
01:20:46,330 --> 01:20:50,900
对不起，我让你失望了，真对不起，爸爸
I'm sorry I let you down. I'm so sorry, Daddy.

687
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:54,040
但你也让我失望了
But you let me down too.

688
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:26,530
我找你都找遍了
I have been lookin' for you all over.

689
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:29,370
他们找到了舒马赫夫妇
They found the Schumachers.

690
01:21:29,470 --> 01:21:31,770
从他们的水杯上取了指纹
Fingerprinted their water glasses.

691
01:21:31,870 --> 01:21:34,610
发现他们在亚利桑那和佛罗里达都被通缉…
Found out they were wanted in Arizona and in Florida...

692
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:37,210
今年夏天他们在这儿大捞了一笔
and they made a fortune here this summer.

693
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:39,210
那么一切都没事了
So then it's all right.

694
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:42,350
我就知道会解决的
I knew it would work out.

695
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:44,720
- 我就知道他们得道歉  - 我被解雇了，宝贝
- I knew they'd have to apologize.  - I'm out, Baby.

696
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:51,890
他们还是解雇了你，因为我
They fired you anyway because of me.

697
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:56,900
如果我悄悄走人，我还能拿到夏季的奖金
And if I leave quietly, I'll get my summer bonus.

698
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:01,800
那么我做的一切都是徒劳
So I did it for nothing.

699
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:05,910
我伤害了家人，你失去了工作…一切都白做了！
I hurt my family, you lost your job anyway... I did it for nothing!

700
01:22:05,970 --> 01:22:07,910
不，没有白做
No, not for nothing.

701
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:11,350
以前从来没有人为我做过这些
Nobody has ever done anything like that for me before.

702
01:22:12,110 --> 01:22:15,350
你说得对，不管做什么你都赢不了
You were right. You can't win no matter what you do.

703
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:18,890
听我说，我不想从你口中听到这句话，你可以的
Listen to me. I don't want to hear that from you. You can.

704
01:22:20,790 --> 01:22:22,890
我曾经这么以为
I used to think so.

705
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,580
豪斯曼医生，我能不能…
Dr. Houseman, can I, uh...

706
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:51,120
瞧，我就快走了，我知道你现在想什么
Look, I'm going anyway and I know what you must be thinking.

707
01:22:51,190 --> 01:22:54,160
你根本不了解我
You don't know anything at all about me.

708
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:56,960
我知道你想让宝贝和你一样
I know you want Baby to be like you.

709
01:22:56,990 --> 01:22:59,830
众人景仰的那种人
The kind of person people look up to.

710
01:22:59,930 --> 01:23:02,130
宝贝就像那样，如果你能知道…
Baby is like that. If you could just see...

711
01:23:02,170 --> 01:23:05,140
不用你来告诉我该知道什么
Don't you tell me what to see.

712
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:07,810
我知道我眼前的这个人让他的舞伴陷入麻烦…
I see someone in front of me who got his partner in trouble...

713
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,270
还把她送到屠夫手中…
and sent her off to some butcher...

714
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:13,610
同时还追求一个天真的少女，就像我的女儿
while he moved on to an innocent, young girl like my daughter.

715
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:21,390
好吧，我想那就是你看到的
Yeah, I guess that's what you would see.

716
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:40,200
没有你在这儿哪怕只呆一天我都无法想像
I can't imagine being here without you even one day.

717
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:44,010
就想想你会有更多的时间练习马术和槌球
Just think, you have more time for horseshoes and croquet.

718
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:49,680
也许现在他们会把你锯成七块
Maybe they'll saw you in seven pieces now.

719
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,190
我想我们让每个人都大吃了一惊
I guess we surprised everybody.

720
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,490
我想是的
I guess we did.

721
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:08,400
不会再有遗憾了
Hardly would be sorry.

722
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:11,900
我也不会
Neither will I.

723
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,710
再见
I'll see ya.

724
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:18,870
我来帮你做头发
I'll do your hair.

725
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:23,080
你会很漂亮的，如果…
It could look pretty if...

726
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:31,420
你还是这样更漂亮
You're prettier your way.

727
01:25:31,490 --> 01:25:32,750
就这样
This way.

728
01:25:55,440 --> 01:26:03,820
凯勒曼的朋友们，我们相聚齐声唱
Kellermans, we come together Singing all as one

729
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:12,030
又一季才艺展示，我们共享乐趣多
We have shared another season's Talent, play and fun

730
01:26:12,090 --> 01:26:20,400
夏日即将要结束，秋日即将要开始
Summer days will soon be over Soon the autumn starts

731
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:27,880
今夜回忆又唤起，翩翩浮现于心中
And tonight the memories whisper Softly in our hearts

732
01:26:28,940 --> 01:26:36,280
手拉手啊心连心，欢声笑语多欢畅
Join hands and hearts and voices Voices, hearts and hands

733
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:44,890
在这凯勒曼山庄，友谊如青山常在
At Kellerman's the friendships Last long as the mountain stands

734
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:53,170
时时刻刻日与夜，无论天气雨或晴
Daytime, nighttime, any hour Weather rain or shine

735
01:26:53,230 --> 01:27:01,580
游戏讲座与玩笑，音乐声中乐融融

736
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:16,890
祝你在医学院好运，孩子
Good luck in medical school, son.

737
01:27:19,090 --> 01:27:21,630
我想谢谢你帮我摆脱了佩妮的麻烦
And I wanted to thank you for your help with the Penny situation.

738
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:25,530
- 我想我们都她被搞得一团糟  - 什么？
- I guess we've all gotten into messes.  - What?

739
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:30,040
我以为宝贝已经告诉你了，我也不确定
I thought Baby told you. Look, I'm not sure.

740
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:33,340
佩妮说的，不过你也知道像那样的女人可以勾搭…
Penny said so, but you know with girls like that. They're liable to pin it...

741
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:35,340
周围任何一个男人
on any guy around.

742
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:44,190
- 今天有什么最新消息吗？ - 结束了
- What's the hot tip for the day?  - Finished.

743
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:48,130
你和我，蒂托，我们全都看见了
You and me, Tito. We've seen it all, eh?

744
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:53,300
波巴和泽达给住宿生送上第一杯经过巴氏消毒的牛奶
Bubbah and Zeda serving the first pasteurized milk to the boarders.

745
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,570
战争岁月里我们没有肉吃
Through the war years when we didn't have any meat.

746
01:27:55,630 --> 01:27:58,370
大萧条时期我们什么也没有
Through the Depression when we didn't have anything.

747
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,900
许许多多的变化，马克思
Lots of changes, though, Max.

748
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:04,440
可这一次不是什么巨大的变化
It's not the changes so much this time.

749
01:28:04,510 --> 01:28:07,080
而是一切好像都要结束了
It's that it all seems to be ending.

750
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:11,150
你以为孩子们还想和他们的父母来跳狐步舞吗？
You think kids want to come with their parents and take fox-trot lessons?

751
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:14,380
去欧洲旅行才是孩子们想要的
Trips to Europe, that's what the kids want.

752
01:28:15,450 --> 01:28:18,020
三天游历二十二个国家
Twenty-two countries in three days.

753
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,390
感觉好像一切都在渐行渐远
It feels like it's all slipping away.

754
01:28:22,590 --> 01:28:30,440
感受假期的心跳，烦恼再也看不到
But the heartbeats of vacation There no cares are seen

755
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:37,940
游客员工与来宾，加入最后大合唱
So let's join in just one last chorus Visitors, staff and guests

莫忘共享的岁月，老友才是最好的
What we've shared won't be forgotten Old friends are the best

757
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:22,920
没人会把宝贝放在角落里
Nobody puts Baby in the corner.

758
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:26,090
来吧
Come on.

759
01:29:46,850 --> 01:29:49,050
很抱歉打断大家…
Sorry about the disruption, folks...

760
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:52,380
季末最后一支舞总是由我来跳的
but I always do the last dance of the season.

761
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:55,490
今年有人让我别跳了
This year somebody told me not to.

762
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:59,360
所以我要来跳自己的舞，和一位出色的舞伴…
So I'm gonna do my kind of dancin' with a great partner...

763
01:30:00,190 --> 01:30:03,100
她不仅是一位出色的舞者…
who's not only a terrific dancer...

764
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,670
而且她让我知道有人…
but somebody who's taught me that there are people...

765
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:08,740
愿意为别人站出来，不管代价是什么
willing to stand up for other people no matter what it costs them.

766
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:12,670
她让我知道…
Somebody who's taught me...

767
01:30:14,610 --> 01:30:16,710
我想做一个什么样的人
about the kind of person I want to be.

768
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:19,380
弗朗西丝・豪斯曼小姐
Miss Frances Houseman.

769
01:30:20,210 --> 01:30:21,610
坐下，杰克
