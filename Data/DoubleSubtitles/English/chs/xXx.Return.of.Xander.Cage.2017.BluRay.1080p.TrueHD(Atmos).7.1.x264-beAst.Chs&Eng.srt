你知道我是从哪得到创立3X项目这一灵感的么？
You know how I came up with the idea of Triple-X program?

4
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,050
用两个词概括就是：滑板和游泳池
Skateboards and swimming pools.

00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,490
一九七七年的时候 滑板十分流行 那时滑板一般是放在地面上玩的
Skateboards used to be stuck on the ground,

9
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,200
只有运输时才会把它们放在交通工具里
unless in transportation. In 1977 habits.

10
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,770
突然一场罕见的旱灾袭击了南加州
A big drought hit southern California.

11
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:04,000
灾情严重 水量不足 向游泳池中灌水的费用十分高昂
连富裕的城市居民都支付不起相关费用
Got so bad that rich urbanites could not afford to fill their swimming pools.

12
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,780
有个孩子灵机一动 他转念一想
That's when the light clicked on. Some kid figured it out ...

13
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,050
不用在意这些空游泳池 到外面去多走走好了
He could escape these empty pools and get some real nasty air

14
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,060
《狗镇和滑板少年》这部电影你看过么
Dogtown and Z-Boys. Have you seen it? It is a movie.

15
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,030
没看过？无所谓了
Does not matter.

16
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,330
这个孩子开始用“滑板”玩出各种新鲜又极限的招式
Anyhow, our hero starts doing things on a board ...

17
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,850
从来没人想到过滑板还能这么玩
and no one had ever seen.

18
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,580
大家觉得这简直不可思议
Things the world thought were impossible.

19
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,420
总结一下 要是没有那场旱灾
Now that kid needed it, that draught.

20
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,940
就没有这些空的游泳池 那个孩子估计也想不出那些好点子
The world needed those empty pools.

21
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,670
我也正是从他的点子里 得到了创立极限特工项目的灵感
That's why Triple-X.

Do you feel safer today than you felt yesterday? I know I do not.

美国的军队 世界规模第一 装备总价最高
The biggest, most expensive military in the world ...

27
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,200
但机场里那些小炸弹还是把美国人民吓得鸡飞狗跳
and we are still scared the shoes and tiny whitey bombs at the airport.

28
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,600
为什么会这样？
Why is that?

29
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,320
因为那些士兵只会服从军令 在战场上冲锋陷阵
Beacuse the soldiers are built to take orders and fight in wars.

30
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,290
但我们这些普通老百姓 虽说没有在战场上厮杀
But we, my friend, are not at war.

31
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,120
但也是危机四伏
We are at peril.

38
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,440
那是因为 这些道貌岸然的混蛋
And that's because those righteous bastard somewhere along the way ...

39

made a deal with the devil. They traded liberty for safety. And us ...

00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,380
吉本斯！快出来！
Gibbons! Gibbons?

134
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,870
我在这呢
Olly, olly, oxen free.

135
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:39,220
吉本斯 你确实大变样了啊
You really do look different, Gibbons.

136
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,100
你是不是减肥了？
Did you lose weight?

137
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,420
吉本斯以前
Augustus always had such...well

138
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,190
说到你的时候用词都不太友好
not excatly nice things to say about you.

139
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,200
你什么时候意识到他们都是在演戏的呢？
When did you realize it was all fake?

140
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,830
你是说刚刚这几个搞笑演员么
You mean the clown show?

141
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,630
你们那边站了一个人 戴着几千块的名牌耳机
You had a guy over there wearing thousand dollars beats...

142
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,990
却在卖假冒商品的小店边徘徊
where you can buy a knock-off for half the price.

143
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,760
还有个女士 跑着赶着上一班两小时后才出发的公交车
Or the lady that was running to catch a bus that doesn't leave for two hours.

144
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:05,430
还有一个警卫 拿着外国货币买汽水喝
Or the security guard over there buying a soda with foreign currency?

145
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,610
你知道最搞笑的地方是什么吗？
You know what the kicker was?

146
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,620
就是那个跟我大谈美好生活的老头
Clearence from "It's a Wonderful Life".

147
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,340
拿着包炸弹坐在我边上
You know the nice old man who sat down next to me with the bag of bombs?

148
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,310
真凑巧 他怎么知道我会说英语呢
Just happen he knows I spoke English.

149
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,080
下次演戏时注意这些小细节哦
Go figure.

150
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,790
- 那枪里的子弹可能是真的啊  - 那你们穿的防弹衣估摸着也是真的
- Bullets could have been real.  - And the body armour would have been real.

151
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,380
我不知道你是何方神圣 但我可不喜欢被人这么耍
I do not know you, but I don't like to be tested.

152
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:30,700
吉本斯从来都不相信你的死讯 他一直在找你
Gibbons never believed you were dead. He never stopped looking for you.

153
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,700
- 真是个忠诚的朋友  - 你肯定是开玩笑吧
- Hell of a friend.  - Yeah. Well, the joke's on him.

154
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,770
- 我们之间从来都算不上朋友  - 相信我 他要是在场 并不会想笑
- Because we were never friends.  - Trust me, he is not laughing.

155
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,780
而且 他估计再也笑不出来了
Nor will he ever again for that matter.

156
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,010
我从没见过身手这么敏捷的人
I had never seen anything like it.

157
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:52,890
他们心狠手辣 人挡杀人佛挡杀佛
This group is lethal, and they do not care who or what gets it their way.

158
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:56,170
继续看看后面的资料 希望你会感兴趣
I was hoping you will be interested in headlining the next five card.

159
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,330
距离九米 落差二十七米
30 feet across, 90 feet down.

160
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,670
穿破了七厘米厚的防弹玻璃？
3 inches security glass?

161
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,820
还没有借助绳子 降落伞等工具
No ropes, no line, no parachute.

162
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,000
怎么说也得来一点定向爆破吧
I bet they had a blast.

163
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,880
我们使用了世界上所有的身份数据库进行面部识别 结果一无所获
We ran facial identification on every database in the world. Nothing.

164
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,440
他们甚至没有因为超速被抓拍过
Not even a match on a speeding ticket.

165
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,940
他们就是现代社会的幽灵
They are ghosts, in a day and age where

166
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,530
用那些东西根本找不到他们
that kind of thing's almost impossible.

167
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,390
这么说吧
Okay

168
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,160
你也知道我不愿意为你们这些政府人员工作
You get that I do not work for suits.

169
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,240
我为什么要破坏我平静的生活 去管你们的事呢？
What makes you think I want to ruin all my life for?

170
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,370
我知道
No...

171
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,250
如果你不愿意为我卖命
if you do not want do it for me ...

172
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,670
至少也得为吉本斯报仇吧
do it for Gibbons.

173
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:40,620
我们的祖国需要您 凯奇先生 极限特工项目需要你出一份力
Your country needs you. Mr. Cage. The Triple-X program needs you

174
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,630
是时候拿出你的爱国之心 为国效力了
It's time to be a patriot.

175
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,000
是不是爱国者还不是你们这些当官的说了算？
By whose definition?

176
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:55,800
上次我爱国的时候 我吃了三枚子弹
Last time I was patriotic, I got three strikes.

177
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,950
只有一个人相信我还没死
And there was only one man who believed in the underdog.

178
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,140
爱国之心已经远去 这个世界里尽是些暴徒和暴君
Patriotism is dead. There are only rebels and tyrants now.

179
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,960
所以你到底打算怎么办
So which are you?

180
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:13,060
我还是干回老本行咯
I am Triple-X.

181
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,860
XXX特工 欢迎回来
Welcome back, Triple-X.

182
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,440
你要去哪？
Where are you going?

183
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,260
- 伦敦  - 为啥？
- London.  - Why? What's in London?

184
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,560
去找猎魔人
Ghosthunter.

185
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,230
顺便把我的皮衣拿回来
And possibly a fur coat.

186
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,790
我都快忘了上面的景色有多美了
I have forgotten how beautiful the view is up here.

187
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,250
你又穿回了你的皮衣啊
Oh, see you found your coat.

188
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,840
是啊 当时你答应的放在你这保管啊
Oh you promise take care of it for me

189
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,490
是啊 我这不是保管的挺好嘛
And I did

190
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,510
我要找一个人
I'm looking for someone.

191
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,410
我们啥时候变成业务合作关系了
Since when did we have a business relationship?

192
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:36,230
你知道我不能再碰电脑了 要不然他们又得把我抓起来了
You know, I get caught even touching a computer, my hour is up for 20.

193
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,700
看看信息 报个价吧
Name your price.

194
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,450
我知道你最擅长干这个了
You know I'm good for it.

195
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,570
这么宝贵的信息 可是无价的呢
Information like this doesn't have a price.

196
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,570
安思丽 一切皆有价
Ainsley, everything has a price.

197
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,600
如果你觉得你手艺生疏 搞不定的话
Now, if you don't think you can pull it off,

198
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,780
直接说就好了 我能理解你的
if you'd lost your edge, just tell me and I'll understand.

199
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,660
凯奇 你知道我现在在想什么吗？
You know what it is, Cage?

200
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,890
你说
What?

201
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,690
我以前觉得你是老大
I used to think you are the man

202
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,390
现在我发现
But now...

203
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:02,070
我也不确定 你可能也只是给他打工罢了
I do not know, maybe I feel that you're working for him

204
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,160
哈哈
Come on

205
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,490
我是一个人来的 没人知道我在哪
Nobody knows I'm here.

206
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,270
你也知道 我不是那种守不住秘密的人
And you know how I am about keeping secrets.

207
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,510
就算你说的没错 我也得考虑一下国际刑警的那些窃听器啊
So you say, but Interpol got these listening bugs.

208
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,340
肉眼基本看不到窃听器藏在哪
I mean, they're practically invisible, real MI-6 kind of shit.

209
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,960
什么皮下监听器之类的
Disappear under your skin, underarms ...

210
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,550
甚至你的私处你可能藏着窃听器哟
tied around your balls like a Christmas bow.

211
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,180
那你倒是好好检查一下我呀
unwrap me, then

212
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,910
你知道吗 研究发现 发生性关系的情侣中
You know, studies have proven that sexual consummation irrevocably ruins ...

213
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,900
十对有九对关系会破裂
nine out of ten relationships.

214
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,960
那我们至少可以赌那百分之十嘛
Lucky for me, you love to gamble.

215
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,370
当然
Of course

216
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:43,970
不行
not.

217
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,340
我会让我的朋友们好好招待你的
My friends on the other hand, adores the ***

218
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,380
是么？
***

219
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,850
这可真是为国效力啊
The things I do for my country.

220
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,330
想找他们的信息就像大海捞针一样难哦
Like finding needles in a stack of needles.

221
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,700
虽然你已多年不亲自上阵
Even though you are shackled by the queen...

222
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,960
你还是这么给力啊
you're still the best of the world.

223
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,350
多谢夸奖
Thank you.

224
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,880
听我一句劝 别蹚浑水
Do yourself a favor. Burn this.

225
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:44,640
我听到了不少消息 这些家伙本事可不小
The words that I hear out in the streets, these ghosts caused real kind of trouble

226
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,410
身手不凡 资金充足
They got training and they got funding ...

227
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:49,490
没人挡得住他们的
and they've got no problem running over anyone who gets in their way.

228
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,220
我明白了 你是怕我受伤吧
I can see you worry that I may get hurt.

229
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,230
我是怕你会英勇“牺牲”哦
I worry that you might get dead.

230
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,780
你怕失去我 我很感动
You know, I'm touched you can't imagine a world without me in it.

231
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,870
要是没你在身边 那该多无聊啊
It would be less fun.

232
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,400
该说的我都说了 你看着办
That's all I'm saying.

233
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:21,710
你要找的那些人现在在菲律宾
Your ghosts are hanging out in Philippines.

234
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:24,070
我就猜到了他们会躲在那边
Figures they go to the Pacific.

235
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,770
估计正躲在孤岛上狂欢吧 一般人还找不到他们
Some jungle rave that's off the grid.

236
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:30,130
你怎么这么快就搞到情报了
How the hell did you find them so quickly?

237
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,170
这可是我出卖色相换来的情报
Undercover work.

238
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:11,250
你把“潘多拉魔盒”放在哪了？
Where is it? What did you do with Pandora's Box?

239
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,420
藏在安全的地方了
It's in a safe place.

240
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,760
这和我们计划中的不一样
That was not part of the plan.

241
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:23,990
我们都共事这么些年了 临时改变计划也不是一次两次了 你还觉得很惊讶？
After all these years, you are still shocked when I improvise?

242
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,540
我惊讶的是 这与我们的任务目标不一致 我们的目的是销毁它
No. But the mission was to destroy it.

243
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,640
这么跟你说吧 任务目标改了
It turns out there's a new mission.

244
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:32,390
我们能利用这玩意达成我们的目标 所以我不打算毁掉它了
I am not going to destroy the one thing that I can use to get what we want.

245
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:35,540
- 全世界都在追捕我们 项！  - 让他们来啊！
- The world is looking for us, Xiang!  - Let them come!

246
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,660
你总是在意那些走卒
You are worried about pawn sacrifice.

247
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,970
而我 眼里只有对面的国王
I get my eye on the king.

248
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,270
现在问题在于
That's the problem.

249
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,310
你把皇后给忘了
You forgot the queen.

250
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,460
[皇家空军基地 英国 莱肯希思]

251
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:03,820
在你成功的挫败了“无政府99”的阴谋之后 上头给了吉本斯很大一笔钱
After your success taking down Anarchy 99, Gibbons was handed a blank check.

252
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:07,160
话说他当时
Which is the long way of saying ...

253
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,330
还给你配了一辆新车吧
he got you a new ride

254
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:12,470
凯奇 在你“死后” 世界可是发生了翻天覆地的变化啊
The world went to another place since your death Cage.

255
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,940
什么无人机 导弹干扰仪
On board drones, anti-air countermeasures ...

256
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:20,250
战机也添置了超大油箱 载油量可供飞机绕地球飞行三圈
and fuel tanks big enough to circumnavigate the globe three times ...

257
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,050
无需着陆加油
without even landing.

258
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:29,750
你可以把厚大衣脱下来了 我保证这里没人敢偷你的衣服
You can check your coat. I promise you no one will dare steal it.

259
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,360
但我可不敢保证衣服会不会自己长脚自己溜出去
I can guarantee it can't walk off on its own.

260
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,010
士兵们 刚刚我跟你们说十分钟后起飞 你们现在还有七分钟准备
Wheels up in ten, boys! which means you are already 7 minutes behind.

261
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:39,070
她平时讲话一直都这么逗的？
Is she always so much fun or just on special occasions?

262
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,390
难怪我们的国家负债累累
No wonder our country in debt trillions of dollars.

263
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,950
就抓几个坏人真的用得上这些先进的玩意么？
Do you really need all these gadgets to get the bad guys?

264
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,820
说实话 大部分我们都用不上
We do not need any of it.

265
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,030
有了这些有趣的玩具 抓捕过程才会更好玩呀
But it make catching more fun.

266
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,840
我去 这不是桑德·凯奇么！
Xander Cage! Holy shit!

267
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,860
终于见到本人了 真刺激！
Live concert in one night only. This is crazy!

268
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,170
我曾经参加过枪炮玫瑰的演唱会
I was at Coachella and Guns N'Roses got back together.

269
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,510
但是这可比那演唱会刺激多了
but this is way cooler

270
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,900
严格意义上说 我当时不在演唱会现场 但是
Well, I was not actually there, but ...

271
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,660
我看了那演唱会的全过程呢 你懂我的意思吧？
I heard about it, you know?

272
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,380
我的天 我真是个话痨
I'm so talking. Oh my God.

273
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,170
抱歉 我一开口就停不下来
Sorry, it's a bad habit. I get started and then ...

274
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,570
- 根本停不下来 然后…  - 深呼吸
- I can not stop and I can not ...  - Breathe.

275
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:34,680
慢慢来 你要是呛着了我可以给你人工呼吸的
Take your time. I know mouth-to-mouth if necessary.

276
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:41,140
看看你结实的双臂
Are you kidding me with those guns?

277
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,210
你特么简直就是个终结者啊！
You look like the fucking Terminator!

278
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,980
不是那个第一代的终结者
I'm not talking about the first Terminator ...

279
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,310
而是那个第二代的 回去杀第一代的那个
but the second Terminator goes back to kill the first terminator.

280
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,850
就是可以融化成液态金属的那个二代终结者
It is the liquid metal guy.

281
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:53,020
克拉里奇特工与吉本斯共事过 她将为你的行动提供技术支持
Agent Claridge worked closely with Gibbons. She will handle support for the operation.

282
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,580
像你这样的顶级特工肯定很需要我的帮助
And a guy like you needs a lot of support.

283
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,030
你有多重来着？二百二十磅？二百三十磅？
What are you like? 220? 230?

284
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:01,370
总不至于两百五十磅吧？
Be honest. 250 is the hardest max for my swing.

285
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,060
- 怎么可能  - 我就开个玩笑
- Oh come on.  - I'm kidding.

286
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,090
偷偷告诉你 我的安全词是“金橘”
It's not like I have a safe word or anything, it is "kumquat".

287
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,270
定这个词的时候我也没想太多
I never really think about it.

288
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,570
“金橘”
kumquat

289
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,310
你呢？
What about you?

290
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,800
我的词典里没有“不安全”
"Not safe" isn't in my vocabulary.

291
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,400
那是 你可以无所不能的桑德·凯奇呀
Touche, you're the Xander Cage.

292
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,480
不管你需要什么 贝奇在一小时内都能给你弄到
Anything you need, Becky can source it within an hour.

293
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,660
除了某些违法药物
Except for any sort of illegal drugs.

294
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,630
那些我十五分钟就能搞到
Those I'll have in 15 minutes.

295
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:25,910
开个玩笑啦
Kidding.

296
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:31,080
如果你需要的是…你就不用来找我了
But if you need a *** of purple ***, I'm not the girl to ask.

297
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,250
凯奇 跟我来 我来给你介绍一下你的地面团队
Okay, Cage, follow me. I'll introduce you to your ground team.

298
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,840
- 谢谢啦 贝奇  - 没事
- Thank you, Becky.  - Of course.

299
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,160
“金橘”
kumquat

300
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,280
我们可以看红牛怪咖秀了
Here comes the Red Bull freak show.

301
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,290
桑德·凯奇 这位是保罗
Xander Cage, I want you to meet Paul...

302
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:49,910
多诺万
Donovan.

303
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,980
保罗·多诺万上校
Captain Paul Donovan.

304
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,370
我在电视上见过你
I know you. I saw you on TV.

305
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,900
总统给你颁发了一枚奖章 当时挺神气的吧？
The president gave him a medal. It must be pretty cool, right?

306
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,340
你们肯定经历了不少大风大浪
You guys must have some seriously cool stories to tell.

307
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,210
见识了不少大场面吧
must have seen a lot.

308
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,760
我想问问你们当中
I wonder:

309
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:11,510
有多少人在越野自行车玩过自由式三连后滚翻的？
How many have ever pulled a free-style triple back flip?

310
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,850
有人这么玩过么？
On a BMX bike before? All of you?

311
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,860
不 我们很少跟自行车打交道
No, we do not play on bicycles.

312
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,520
是么
Oh, you do not play on bikes?

313
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,590
那有没有人在雪崩的时候
any of you ever carved an R4

314
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,480
玩过滑雪板呢？
On a snowboard ...

315
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,190
滚滚飞雪追在你屁股后面 真是刺激啊
while an avalanche is on your booty?

316
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:29,630
我们是前途无量的特种兵 可不是什么玩杂技的懒人
We're soldiers, hotshot, not slackers.

317
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,520
好吧 那你们肯定在东欧
Okay, but you all ...

318
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,640
用标准的军用降落伞设备玩过
have HALO jumps over Eastern Europe ...

319
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:38,940
高空跳伞 我没说错吧
using a standard-issued armor dempolyed parachute system. Am I right?

320
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,140
从来没有的事
No.

321
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,530
你个蠢货 我们可没你的闲心玩那些杂技呢
We're not all jack up on Mountain Dew and Red Bull, you asshole.

322
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,660
你是在哪找到这家伙的？
Where did you find this guy?

323
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,580
凡事都有第一次 祝你们玩的开心哟
Oh there is the first time for everything.

324
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:59,220
你这是在干什么？我简直不敢相信我的眼睛
What did you just do? I can not believe this shit.

325
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,300
我才不会跟这几个猪队友合作呢
I am not gonna have clowns watch my back.

326
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,010
那我你倒是说说看 你愿意跟谁合作
I know I'm gonna regret asking you this, but who would you trust?

327
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,830
这个电话也就你一个人知道
You know no one has this number.

328
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,860
最近都在忙啥呢
So what do you up to these days?

329
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,020
我么 我就四处走走
Me? Moving in odds.

- Go in, go!  - Show me your hands!

334
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,590
走出车来！
Get out of the car, now!

335
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,210
这场景仿佛似曾相识啊！

听到没有？
Do you hear me?

341
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,480
那里有个人直接过去了
That guy got through!

342

最近过得怎样？
What, Nyjah?

我就愿意跟他们这样的人一起并肩作战
This is the team I can work with.

352
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,890
简单的给你们介绍一下情况
I'll make it easy for you.

353
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,880
这四个人 是大坏蛋
These four assholes: very bad guys.

354
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,570
潘多拉魔盒 就是个不好的东西
Pandora's Box: very bad thing.

355
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:31,570
把你们送到马尼拉后 你们自己坐船去他们藏身的岛上
You will land at Manila and you will requsition your own transportation to the island.

356
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:34,890
为啥不直接丢一个核弹把那个岛轰平么
Why don't we just nuke this bitch in oil bean and car, eh?

357
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,190
这么说吧 这个“潘多拉魔盒”是独一无二的
Pandora's Box is one of a kind

358
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,150
我们得把它毫发无损的弄回来
It needs to be recovered intact.

359
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,550
为啥？它具体有啥功能？
Why? What does it do?

360
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,000
- 精神控制？  - 就是它杀死了吉本斯
- Brainwave scrambler?  - It killed Gibbons.

361

你们只需要知道这么多 剩下的均为机密信息
All you need to know. The rest is classfied.

肯定是精神控制仪
Brainwave scrambler

363
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,530
我觉着吧
Do you smell that?

364
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,820
这些穿西装的还是那种老调调 什么机密不机密的
It smells like the same shit in a different suit.

365

你应该知道“飞盘游戏”的玩法吧
You think a dog knows how to work "Frisbee"?

366
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:59,340
主人说“去捡” 小狗就会跑过去把飞盘叼回来
The master says "fetch," and the bitch listens.

367
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,100
你嘴里叼着飞盘的样子 一定很性感
You'd look so sexy with a Frisbee in that mouth.

368
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,640
亲爱的 我可不是在跟你说笑
Sweetheart, this is not a game.

369
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,570
你们现在都是我手下的士兵
You're all my soldiers now.

370
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:10,650
- 我可不是士兵 我只是个舞厅控场员罢了  - 我们看起来像士兵么？
- I'm not a soldier, I'm a parlour.  - Do we look like soldiers?

371
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:11,850
怎么可能
Oh hell no.

372
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:15,130
- 我们你的士兵都丢在东欧那边了  - 你为啥不把她也顺便丢下去呢？
- I drop your soldiers over Eastern Europe.  - Why did you leave lassie behind?

373
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:18,170
这是我负责的行动 你们都得听我的！
This is my operation! You will listen to me.

374
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,740
看起来这会已经没必要开下去了
The meeting is over.

375
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,910
那么 林肯女士 接下去要怎么办？
Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln ... how was the play?

376
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,510
这个是超级护甲
That's super strength body armor.

377
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:42,260
你得把这个皮带系到
We got to tighten the belt ...

378
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,390
这边
Over here.

379
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,120
再到这边
I got this on.

380
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,330
你是我的操作员么？
What are you, my handler?

381
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,110
你需要我帮你什么 我就是什么
I am whatever you need.

382
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,400
我能搞定一切问题
I can handle anything.

383
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,310
再把这系紧一些
And I got a tight grip.

384
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,890
顺便说一句 我不出外勤的
And just for you know, I'm not a field agent.

385
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:01,020
我从没出过外勤 从来没有过
I do not go out in the field. Ever.

386
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,250
我觉得一名特工的乐趣 就在于外出行动
That's where all the fun is.

387
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:06,000
出门我会觉得很害怕
Fun scares me.

388
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,110
我怕见到枪
People scare me, guns scare me.

389
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,360
那些舞刀弄枪的真得把我吓死 如果我被吓着了 我就做不成我的本职工作了
People with guns really scare me, If I'm scared I can not do my job.

390
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,510
完成不好我的工作 就会有人牺牲 要是你们都牺牲了
And if I can't do my job, then people die. And if people die, who does my tech supporting?

391
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,140
我的技术支持还有什么用
Literally no one.

392
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,750
但我会竭尽全力确保你的安全的
But I'll make sure to keep you safe.

393
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,710
想确保我的安全可不容易哟
It ain't easy to keep me safe.

394
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,720
我最喜欢这个新玩意了
Yes, these badboys are my favorites.

395
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,110
它们叫“铁锤” 可用于地面肉搏战
They called Exogloves . *** new ground combat initiative.

396
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:38,020
气泵驱动 可将拳击力量加到四倍
pneumatic pistons drive the gears. qualdruple the speed, and power of the punches.

397
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,390
别动那个
No no.

398
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,480
这个是多频道信号干扰仪
This is a multi-stage signal disrupter

399
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,980
极其容易损坏
It is very, very breakable

400
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,340
你能告诉我泛美航空一〇三航班坠毁
Can you tell me the real reason behind the crash?

401
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,550
背后的真相么？
Of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie?

402
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,490
可以
Yes.

403
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,590
你应该读过那些机密文件吧
You're one of them, right?

404
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,030
亲 别乱来
Hey easy. Rocky.

405
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,860
我跟你说 这玩意能在飞机上
I wasn't kidding when I say it because the force of these badboys

406
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,280
搞个大洞
to cut a hole in a fucking plane.

407
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,990
我再四处走走 看看还会不会有别的地方出乱子
Keep walking around. What can possibly go wrong?

408
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,580
- 我就爱玩点刺激的  - 好啊 你真行
- That's my style, though.  - Yes, good. glad to hear.

409
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,570
你知道么 这个…
You know? Actually...

410
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:18,540
我跟你说可以…
I would rather if you...

411
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,810
真棒 你动手能力不错啊
That's refreshing. You actually know what you are doing down there.

412
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,710
是啊
Yes, that's what she said.

413
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,090
[卡拉莫安群岛 菲律宾]

414
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,990
让他们过去
Let them pass.

415
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,620
兄弟 需要什么？
Need something, man?

416
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,750
我听说这是个可以让我的船员避避风头的好地方
I heard this is a perfect place to disappear for a few days ...

417
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,150
听说不问出身 不问来头
for my crew, no questions asked

418
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,930
付个好价钱 你就可以把我这当你家了
My home is your home, if you pay good price.

419
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
很好
Perfect.

420
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:39,690
泰尼森！
Tennyson!

421
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:45,530
我觉着你肯定喜欢这些玩意 我手里有这片地方最好的枪
Figure you like this. I just happen to have the best *** in the South Pacific.

422
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,480
留下百分之三十 我给你来一个豪华住宿套餐
30% of the top gets you a finest hospitality package.

423
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:01,180
百分之三十？我是不是还能带上几个椰子 带走几个女孩子逍遥快活几个晚上？
30% of the top? Can I get the girls for a weekend and two coconuts?

424
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,600
最多百分之十吧
Ten percent.

425
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,080
百分之十？你在逗我笑？
10%?

426
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:10,400
你还是去别的地方吧
I think looking the other island without laws, it happens all the time.

427
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:15,290
你这么办 掉头 回你的破船 滚远点吧
I'll tell you what to do. You turn around, go get your boat. You kiss my ass.

428
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:18,090
等会 我跟他们商量一下
It's okay. Hanging on.

429
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,800
你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

430
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:21,290
就这么定了！
You talked me into it!

431
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,160
百分之十八吧
Eighteen percent!

432
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,910
当我这是旧货市场呢？
You think this is a flea market?

433
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:29,500
当我这是卖破旧电视假手表的杂货铺呢？
You think we neighborhoods sell televisions and fake watches or something like that?

434
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:31,470
兄弟 你脑子没问题吧？
What's wrong with you, friend?

435
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,910
再多给你一点吧 百分之二十二点五如何？
All right. 22.5%.

436
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,540
你要怎么给我半把枪？
How do I give the half?

437
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,050
很简单
Twenty two...

438
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:46,730
喏 给你半把
and a half.

439
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:57,640
兄弟 进来吧
Hi man. Enjoy the party.

440
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,230
我就喜欢你这种作风
I like your style, man.

441
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,270
不管发生什么 待在船上
Stay on that boat, no matter what.

442
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,900
阿黛尔 尼克斯 跟我来
Adele, Nicks!

443
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:11,280
各位 打开你们的耳机
Well, guys, keep your ear bugs in.

444
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:14,940
像往常一样 阿黛尔 你爬到高处观察全局
Like always, Adele, you're my eyes in the sky.

445
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,610
尼克斯 你就四处走走
Nicks, you are gonna show how we did.

446
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,830
看那边
You got this?

447
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,270
天天就知道看那些东西
You just watch.

448
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,990
请把我的衣服寄存一下吧
Can you keep this behind the bar, please?

449
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:11,660
您要喝点什么？
What can I get you?

450
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,990
给我来一杯蔓越莓苏打水
A cranberry club soda.

451
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,640
来两份
Make that two.

452
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,350
- 谢谢  - 不客气
- Thank you.  - You're welcome.

453
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:27,850
保持警惕
Stay focus.

454
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:29,890
好吧
Really?

455
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:39,160
桑德·凯奇重出江湖啦
Xander Cage. Back in action.

456
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:41,260
我只是隐退了一小段时间好么
Did I ever leave?

457
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,040
发现目标了
Spot that clown.

458
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,260
比我想象的容易多了 他在四处晃荡呢
Easier than we expected. Drinks all around.

459
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:16,930
有人跟来了 去解决他
That's him.

460
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:43,890
又到了我最喜欢的
***. douche bag hunting season.

461
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:45,370
狙击傻瓜时间了
my favorite.

462
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,000
这么早就开枪 不太好吧
It is too early in the evening to slay someone.

463
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:51,260
- 我去搞定他  - 我去
- Let me fix it.  - Oh come on.

464
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,920
我一枪不就完事了么
The *** doesn't deserves a bullet? I think he does.

465
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,640
感觉大家还不够热情啊
Is this a party or a funeral?

466
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:05,120
大家跳起来啊！
Either way, somebody is going to hang up tonight!

467
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,390
跟你说吧 他很会调节气氛的
Told you he was fun having around.

468
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,110
最开始我以为你们是特种部队的
At first I thought Special Forces.

469
00:44:57,970 --> 00:44:59,460
但你身上的文身挺多
But your inks all wrong.

470
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,640
中情局的？
CIA?

471
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,100
他们估计会直接派无人机把我们轰成灰
They would send in a drone to bomb us to hell.

472
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:06,930
军情六处的？
MI6?

473
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,170
感觉你没有他们特工身上的气质
You are not kind of subtlety they prefer

474
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:16,300
你知道来岛上的人都是来避风头的
You know the men who come to this island. They're on the run.

475
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,790
都是躲避追捕之类的
Hiding from the world.

476
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,830
你肯定不是那号人
But not you.

477
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:23,240
你肯定不是来寻一个藏身之处的
You are not here to hide.

478
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:25,730
你是来找东西的
You're looking for someone.

479
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:32,410
你怎么就知道 我还没找到我想找的东西呢？
Who says I haven't already find it?

480
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:39,270
你这是在恐吓我？
Do you want to scare me?

481
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:41,480
恐惧能让我们的对话更加有趣
a little tremble will be nice.

482
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,140
那么
Well...

483
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:47,910
如果你觉得你能把我吓走的话
considering one tremble to make you run away from here...

484
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:52,770
我警告你 最好别轻举妄动
I'd say I'm close enough.

485
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,710
哟 看上去你不是那种贤妻良母嘛
Does this means you're not making any breakfast in the morning?

486
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:01,510
我就动手又何妨？
I'd say a couple of inches off.

487
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:09,240
看起来陷入了僵局啊
Bit of a stalemate.

488
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:11,070
你要是先把枪放下 就能结束僵局了
Not if you drop the gun

489
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:13,470
我不是坏人
I'm not the bad guy.

490
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:17,120
哪怕你是好人 我也不信你
I don't believe in good guys.

491
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:19,260
赛琳娜？
Serena?

492
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,220
他是谁
Who is he?

493
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:26,810
我们才刚刚认识
We just met.

494
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,630
除非我们中哪个人决定打破僵局
But we got along famously until somebody ...

495
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:32,900
要么我们就一直这么僵持下去吧
decided to interrupt

496
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:34,590
按着岛上的小路走下去
stick to the path

497
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:36,690
亲爱的 拿好你的枪
Here honey

498
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:39,710
你会看到岛上的乱坟地
There are a lot of unmarked graves on the island.

499
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:45,410
我打赌 把这花衬衫卖给你的小贩 估计就埋在那里吧
And I'll bet whoever sold you that shirt is one of them.

500
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:48,960
你要在这打探多久？
How long do you intend to push a look?

501
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,500
在我找到我想要的东西前 我都不会走的
Until I get what I came for.

502
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,450
所以你到底想找什么
which is what exactly?

503
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:59,690
先来几杯烈酒再说
A damn stiff drink.

504
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:26,570
来吧 我们来谈重点 你就是来找这个的吧
So, let's be real and talk about what we all really want.

505
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:35,840
没错
I am only here for that.

506
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:40,660
我是这么想的 你们可以放下它 毫发无损的离开 除非你想继续我们之前那么舞刀弄枪的
In my minds, you guys can walk away nicely. unless you want to continue our foreplay?

507
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:43,910
像那样的力量不属于任何人
Power like that doesn't belong in anyone's hands.

508
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,660
我这也是临时改变计划哟
Just improvising.

509
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:59,570
我没看错吧？手榴弹？这不是上世纪九十年代的东欧的玩法么？
Seriously? A grenade? What is this? Eastern Europe in 1990s?

510
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:01,210
这么复古 他是不是以后准备发传真呢？
Next, he's gonna send you a fax.

511
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:04,050
你愿意我拿到这个东西
So you are willing to kill?

512
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,850
而大开杀戒么
Just to keep that for yourself?

513
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:08,690
问题不是这么问的
That's a wrong question to ask.

514
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,660
正确的问题是？
What's the right question?

515
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:15,690
“你愿意为它而死么？”
"Are you willing to die for it?"

516
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:24,050
一枚手雷 三条性命
One grenade, three people.

517
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,860
这就有趣了
I like the odds.

518
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:34,470
两枚手雷 三条性命
Two grenades, three people.

519
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,540
这就更有趣了
I'm loving these odds.

520
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,490
你有没有过那种经历 你失血过多 睁开双眼 周围的一切都是红色的
Have you never bled so much that when you open your eyes, all you see is red?

521
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,400
你在战场里摸爬滚打
When you have fought in wars on every continent.

522
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:52,980
桑德 下命令吧 我可以两枪搞定他们
Come on X, just say the word, Let me put both these two arseholes out in the pasture.

523
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,400
只有死亡
Except death.

524
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:56,560
人是何等的脆弱
Our bodies are such fragile.

525
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,960
让我开枪吧
Let me shoot him.

526
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:59,670
死亡有时就在
Death sometimes just...

527
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:02,180
不经意间袭来
sneak on you

528
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,720
我已经很久没玩过“烫手山芋”了
It's been a while since I played hot potato.

529
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:08,530
我当时躺在病床上
I'm in a hospital bed.

530
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:12,590
神志不清 奄奄一息
I'm barely conscious, delirious. Drowning in my own blood.

531
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:16,260
我的脑子里盘旋着一个声音 “今天就是…
And all I can hear myself to think is "Today is the day"

532
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,220
“今天就是你死的那一天”
"Today is the day you die"

533
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,980
真是个感人的故事
I'm touched.

534
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,930
能把我的外套拿来么
Can I have my jacket?

535
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:25,180
后来有一个人来看望我 跟我讲了一个
There is a man comes along, tells me the story ...

536
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:28,400
关于加州旱灾的故事
about a drought in California.

537
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,460
还提到了什么滑板和游泳池
About skateboards and swimming pools.

538
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,200
其中讲到了一个叫桑德·凯奇的人
About a man named Xander Cage.

539
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:38,030
我的天 他也是一个极限特工啊
Oh shit. He is Triple-X.

540
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,880
我听说他已经死了
I heard he was dead.

541
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,560
是么？
Is he?

542
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,130
我们都是极限特工
We are all Triple-X.

543
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,060
只是目标各有不同
We just have different agenda.

544
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:58,520
她是想着销毁它
She wants to destroy it.

545
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:00,930
我是决定将它化为己用
I'm going to use it.

546
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:06,110
我是不可能让你把它带回国安局的
And I will be damned if I am gonna let you take it back to NSA

547
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,200
[机密文件]

548
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:30,050
现在派对才像样嘛
Now it's a party.

549
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,350
要出大乱子喽
Shit's about to go down.

550
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,060
你觉得这很好玩？
You think that is for fun?

551
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,230
把音乐关掉！
Turn off the music!

552
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:58,750
关掉！
Stop it!

553
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:09,780
所有人举起手来！
Everybody hands up!

554
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,070
快！
Now!

555
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:13,330
都趴到地上
On the floor!

556
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:17,720
谁先动 我就崩了谁
First person to move, first person to die!

557
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,760
我动了
I moved.

558
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:33,070
我又动了
I moved again.

559
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:34,750
我怎么还活着呢
I am still alive.

560
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,850
闭嘴吧 蠢货
Shut up, "hero"!

561
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,090
好吧
All right.

562
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,260
我们来好好谈谈
Let's do this.

563
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:42,550
别动
Do not move!

564
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,570
我手上有你想要的东西
Well, I actually have what you want.

565
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,820
你不就是想要“潘多拉魔盒”嘛
Pandora's box?

566
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,180
它就在我这呢
I got it right here.

567
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,220
但是你听好了
But you're wrong though.

568
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:58,860
你想把它从我这拿走 只怕你也活不成了
You take it from me, and you die first.

569
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:02,330
还有你自以为能保证你安全的大兵们
Then Lieutenant Leningrad, thinks he got you back

570
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,390
两位大兵
Then the two Ivans by the door.

571
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,200
吧台那边的一位
Moscow Mule by the bar.

572
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:11,420
台阶上的那位大兵 都要战死了
Then Igor on the stairs.

573
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,900
你想不想来试试看？
See where we are going with this?

574
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:17,360
那些都是后话了
But none of that matters.

575
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:20,300
我已经说过了
Because like I said ...

576
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:25,120
你要是想夺走它 只怕你也活不了喽
if you take this from me, you die first.

577
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,160
不管你是死是活 我都能搞到它
I will take it from you, dead or alive.

578
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:34,590
如果你死的时候攥的太紧 那我们就把的手切下来一起带走
If you hold it too tight, they cut your arm off.

579
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:36,490
那我们走着瞧
Suit yourself.

580
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:46,840
干掉一个
Leningrad.

581
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:48,270
两个
Hello Ivan.

582
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:49,620
三个
The other Ivan.

583
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,970
四个
Goodbye, Moscow Mule.

584
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,530
这是第五个 桑德 我又救你一命了
Igor. It's another one you owe me. X.

585
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:10,810
枪法可以的
Read between the lines.

586
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:30,290
泰尼森 你是不是要来支援一下
Tennyson! Some back will be nice.

587
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:33,430
来支援一下我们啊！快来！
Some back will be nice! Come on man!

588
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,350
桑德叫我不管如何都待在船上
X says I stay on the boat.

589
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:41,980
他就随口一说 快来吧！
That was before the goddamn Russian invasion takes down ,man!

590
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,530
桑德说了 我不管如何都待在船上
X says stay on the boat.

591
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,330
你要跟我玩这个？
Do you want to play?

592
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,890
那种力量不属于任何人
That doesn't belong in anyone's hands.

593
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:25,650
想要的话就来抢吧
If you want it. Come and get it.

594
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:31,310
这样真的好么？
Was that necessary?

595
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,760
吉本斯正希望我们这么做呢
It's what Gibbons would have wanted.

596
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,500
桑德！
X!

597
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,080
桑德！
X.

598
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,810
出大事了 又一个卫星掉下来了
It happened again. Another satellite fell.

599
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:52,250
要不要加入我们？
How's working as a team?

600
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,680
吉本斯肯定希望我们这些极限特工并肩作战呢
That's what Gibbons would have wanted.

601
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,400
你来不来
You in?

602
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:04,330
发生在奥林匹克体育馆的爆炸震动了整个莫斯科
An explosion inside the Olympic Stadium rocks Moscow

603
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,200
七位工作人员已确认遇难
Seven workers are now confirmed dead.

604
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:10,410
二十五位受伤
With at least 25 others injured in this senseless act of violence.

605
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:12,810
根据五角大楼公布的信息
A source inside the Pentagon says ...

606
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:17,120
可能有人把失控的卫星作为武器
a rouge satellite may have been used as a weapon.

607
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:21,200
按这么说来 “潘多拉魔盒”已经不再是机密咯
This means that Pandora's Box is not exactly classified.

608
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:24,840
几分钟前 一个匿名组织公布了一段录像
In a new video, released just moments ago, an anonymous group ...

609
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:29,200
宣称他们有能力将卫星作为动能武器
is claiming to have the ability to use satellites as weapons. They claimed

610
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:33,820
他们说“必须阻止破坏
quote "The violation of civil liberties of all citizens of the world ...

611
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:36,250
世界公民自由的暴行”
It is an atrocity that must be stopped "

612
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:41,600
在二十四小时内终止并取消世界上所有的间谍项目
Disable and dismantle all the world spy programs within the next 24 hours ...

613
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:44,990
否则我就帮你们坠毁这些间谍卫星 一次一个
or I will do it for you one satellite at a time.

614
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:48,130
目前共有三万枚卫星绕地球运行
There are 30,000 satellites orbiting the Earth at this moment.

615
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:53,070
我将会每二十四小时坠毁一个 直接世界各国满足我的要求
I will drop one satellite every 24 hours until my demands are met.

616
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:54,760
在莫斯科的目击者声称…
eyewitnesses in Moscow ...

617
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:57,760
- 你们是不是每次任务都要对付这种丧心病狂的混蛋？  - 当然不是
- Was this always part of mission to you?  - Of course not.

618
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,230
桑德走后 吉布斯组织了新的极限特工队 我们都是其中的成员
We were a new Triple-X team Gibbons created.

619
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:06,810
当时我们发现了一个高级别的情报官员正试图私自操纵卫星
We discovered a high-level intelligence officer who was trying to manipulate satellites.

620
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,410
在我们把他揪出来之前
And even before we could unmask him

621
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:11,330
吉布斯遇害了
Gibbons was killed.

622
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:13,690
所以你一直都知道 他们都是极限特工
So you knew they were Triple-X all along

623
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:16,200
我需要你在执行任务时保持客观
I needed you to retain a sense of objectivity.

624
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:20,480
我不太明白 如果我之前毁掉了“潘多拉魔盒” 那莫斯科这个是什么情况？
I don't understand. If I destroyed Pandora's Box. What happened in Moscow?

625
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:22,820
如果我没错的话
If I am right, which I am ...

626
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:26,360
这个盒子最多只能操纵一颗卫星
this box only had the ability to control one satellite.

627
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:27,910
你的意思是？
What does that mean?

628
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:30,570
我们一直在追踪的只是一台原型机
It means we have been chasing a prototype.

629
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:33,530
- 恐怖分子手上的那台才是真货？  - 没错
- And these guys have the real one?  - Yes.

630
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:44,960
塞丽娜把我们给耍了
Serena played us like fools.

631
00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:47,600
她背叛了我们
betrayed us.

632
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:51,400
别管她了 现在这乱子闹得可不小
This is not about Serena. This is a war.

633
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,230
要么我们想办法阻止他们 要么就眼睁睁的看着世界变成一片火海 这才是重点
And either we stop today or we watch the world burn tomorrow. can't lose focus on that.

634
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:01,130
你去哪了 咋动作这么慢？
Where were you have you been? You stopped ***

635
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:03,150
去你丫的
Your mom says hi.

636
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:05,700
定位器安装好了吧？没被人发现吧？
tracker on board? Nobody saw you?

637
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:07,930
- 老板 绝对万无一失  - 很好
- No one ever sees me, boss  - good.

638
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:12,310
这些高官掌控着太空中卫星的动向
These suits control every spy satellites in the sky.

639
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:16,920
一般来说 这些高官多久会坐在一起开会？
But, how often these seven men all sit in the same room together?

640
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:18,670
基本不会坐到一起吧
Almost never

641
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,830
如果需要收集他们的视网膜信息
And if you needed retinal scans ...

642
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:26,840
手机数据转存记录 生物特征值
cellphone data dumps, biometrics of all the superpowers in the world...

643
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,450
你觉得谁最有可能做到这一点
Who would you target?

644
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:30,750
不是吧
Shit

645
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,480
你觉得谁最能毫不费力的收集到这些信息？
Who has that kind of power to actually set that in motion?

646
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:39,490
只怕你是怀疑错人了 凯奇 别忘了 可是我去找你的哟
You're pissing up the wrong tree, Cage. I came looking for you, remember?

647
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,450
混蛋 我们是不是要来算算账？
Oh, asshole. We are going to have problems?

648
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,280
行啊 跳伞玩的愉快么？
Oh no problem. How was your trip?

649
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:48,070
我心里在算点东西呢
I'm just doing the maths.

650
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:50,380
是么 你在算什么？
Oh yeah? What maths?

651
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:53,810
距离除以降落速度
Air velocity divided by distance.

652
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:58,060
所以当我把你送下去的时候 搜救队
So when I stuff you down the toilet, the search and rescue...

653
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,860
知道该去哪把你们这帮废物救回来
know where to find you between China and North Korea.

654
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,360
伙计 你就继续放屁吧
keep talking shit, man.

655
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:04,440
走着瞧吧 大兵
Hold that thought, GI Joe.

656
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:08,170
往回倒
Roll it back

657
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:10,710
再倒一点
A little more.

658
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:11,900
再倒一点
more

659
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,450
再倒一点 暂停
A little more. stop.

660
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,250
看这里 当项撞破玻璃跳进来的时候
Okay, when Xiang broke the window ...

661
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:25,520
只有一个人波澜不惊
He is the only one that did not flinch.

662
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:27,950
我需要马上同总统通电话
I need the president on the phone immediately

663
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:31,980
那可是块量子屏啊 别写在上面 擦不掉啊！
That's not gonna scrub off. You know that right? It was a quantum screen!

664
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:35,700
原来这么些年 中情局的局长一直想毁灭世界啊
It seems that the director of the CIA has been trying to destroy the world for years.

665
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:39,490
总统把处理这个混蛋的事务全权交给我们了
We have carte blanche to track this son of bitch down

666
01:01:40,090 --> 01:01:42,330
你们中有人知道下一步应该怎么办吗？
Do any of you know how to do it?

667
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:45,340
就用我和项在纽约定位到“潘多拉魔盒”的办法吧
The same way Xiang and I found Pandora's Box in New York.

668
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:51,990
卫星环绕地球运行 因此它需要定期与卫星重新建立连接
Pandora's box needs to be reconnecting itself because of the satellites orbit.

669
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:53,470
抱歉 我需要操作一下
Excuse me.

670
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:56,680
我们只需要追踪一个主要信号
All what we need to do is to track down the main signals.

671
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,860
然后我们可以大致定位到信号源 误差不超过三十二千米
and then we can approximate its location within a 20 mile radius.

672
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:07,560
世界这么大 这家伙哪都没去
Of all the places in the world ...

673
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:10,130
就藏在底特律？
this fruit choose Detroit?

674
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:21,930
莫斯科的爆炸震惊了整个世界
The blasts did take place in Moscow, but they were felt around the world.

675
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:26,350
今天早上 莫斯科爆炸事故的遇难人数迅速上升
In the morning, *** the death toll of Moscow's tragedy has rised.

676
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:32,870
我觉得是不是大家都在鼓动政府取消监听项目啊
Let me guess. Everyone's jumping at the chance to dismantle their spy program.

677
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:35,150
不
No.

678
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:39,310
他们都太蠢了 不知道莫斯科的爆炸只不过是虚张声势罢了
The world is too stupid to realize that Moscow was a bluff.

679
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:46,090
极限特工们 你们将会驻扎在一个国安局的安全屋
Okay, Triple-X, you will base at an NSA safe house.

680
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:51,040
贝奇负责协调你们的通讯 并准备好信号干扰仪
Becky will coordinate your bug communications, and have the signal disrupter on standby.

681
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:54,700
兄弟 我为了救你的命 都把船开到岸上了
Mate, when I crashed the boat on shore to save your life ...

682
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:56,390
随你这么说咯 兄弟
Whatever bro

683
01:02:56,830 --> 01:03:01,530
你觉得严格意义上 那能算我特技生涯的第一百九十九次事故么
Do you think that counts as crash #199 for me? You know, officially?

684
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:03,820
严格意义上来说 你真是个疯子
Officially, you're deranged

685
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:07,750
设备还真是齐全啊
Cool.

686
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,200
我们会在城市里设置一个三角定位系统
We will set up a triangulated signal tracking system around the city

687
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:14,820
贝奇确认好它的准确位置后 你们就开始行动
When Becky locks in its exact location, we make our move.

688
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:18,480
你呢 你会参与行动么？
What about you? How did you get involved in all this?

689
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,960
我曾经爬了个摩天轮 被抓起来判了一年
I dangled the skyscraper, and go to a year jail for it.

690
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:23,610
这也违法？
Jail?

691
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:26,780
似乎判的重了点
Seems excessive.

692
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,460
那玩意差不多有三十层楼高
The *** was 30 storeys tall.

693
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:31,900
录像发到Youtube上收获两百万点击了
Two million hits on YouTube.

694
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,220
我只在监狱里呆了半年
And I served only half the sentence.

695
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:37,610
别急 让我猜猜接下来的情节 吉本斯去救你了？
Let me guess. Gibbons to the rescue.

696
01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:40,920
他说像我这么有才的人关在监狱里可惜了
He said a lion like me doesn't belong in any kind of cage.

697
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:52,250
我离开极限特工项目后 也画了个纹身
I got mine after I left NSA.

698
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:55,390
- 你手腕上那个是在哪画的？  - 伦敦
- What about that one your wrist?  - London.

699
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:58,860
二〇〇九年的时候我徒手攀爬了伦敦眼
In 2009 climbed the Millennium Wheel.

700
01:03:59,890 --> 01:04:00,890
一丝不挂哦
Naked.

701
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,310
- 没穿衣服？  - 对的
- Naked?  - Yeah.

702
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:04,410
这是我高中时画的
High school.

703
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:08,140
天！
Oh no!

704
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:10,940
我们总有一些比较尴尬的时刻
We all have our embarrassing moments.

705
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:16,030
你身上的那个纹身是什么来头？
What about that sexy one?

706
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:19,360
你是说这个嘛 凤凰涅槃重生？
This? The phoenix out of the ashes.

707
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:21,660
在墨西哥的时候 画了十八个小时
18 hours in a chair in Mexico.

708
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:24,000
喝了不知道多少龙舌兰酒才熬过去
drank my body in tequila to get through it.

709
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:27,590
这个纹身对我来说意义非凡
It is the most important one actually

710
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:32,280
因为正是那个时候我决定拯救世界
It is when I decided to change the world instead of ...

711
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:34,200
而不是摧毁它
rage against it.

712
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,140
找到他了 已经定位到“潘多拉魔盒”的位置了
We found him. We found Pandora's Box.

713
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:44,510
桑德 听到了么？
Xander, do you copy?

714
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:47,850
收到 派泰尼森过去
We are here. Okay, send Tennyson.

715
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:51,850
地址应该是国会街 东四〇四号 他在顶楼
Looks like East 404, Congress streets. He is on the top floor.

716
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:00,350
[选择卫星]

717
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,870
已经探测到“潘多拉魔盒”发出的信号 我可以干扰它
I'm sure activity with Pandora's Box. I can jam signal

718
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:08,270
但持续不了太久 你们动作快点
but only a few minutes, so hurry.

719
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:13,810
赶过去 把那家伙给解决了
You got to get there fast and take this guy down.

720
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:20,170
除非我们先找到他
Not if we find him first.

721
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:28,670
小心红灯
Red light!

722
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:37,740
你知道吧 交通灯就是那些石油巨头发明出来浪费油 增加利润的
You know traffic signals are invented by big oil to waste fuel, drive up profits.

723
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,900
你说的都对 能不能麻烦你开慢点？小心！
If I say "yes", would you please slow down? Look out!

724
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:44,450
让我猜猜看
Wait.

725
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:49,260
你这么盯着我 是不是现在还不信任我？
Is this the part where you anticipate, then you got your eye on me, you don't trust me?

726
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:51,200
猜的不假
Welcome to the moment.

727
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:06,490
但还是给你点武器防身吧
Everyone needs back up.

728
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,270
停车！
Stop!

729
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:12,580
停车！
Stop!

730
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
泰尼森？
Tennyson?

731
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,760
前面的路都堵死了
A gridlock.

732
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:25,140
就是那栋楼顶
There it is.

733
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:28,210
如果你遇到了什么麻烦
If you run into trouble ...

734
01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:29,980
按九号键
dial nine.

735
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:32,100
这是吉本斯留下的备用方案
It is an old Gibbons fail safe.

736
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:50,480
你搞砸了我的派对 抢走了我的舞伴
You crashed my party! stole my dance partner!

737
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:52,770
我跟你没完
I will crash yours.

738
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:54,070
拖住他们
Have fun.

739
01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:56,730
这可不是一场派对 这是一场竞赛
This is not a party. This is a race.

740
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,830
- 你在想啥呢？  - 我在建斜坡呢
- What the hell think you are you doing?  - building a ramp.

741
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:25,460
冲冲冲
Go go go.

742
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:08,110
滚出来 快点
out of car! get out!

743
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:09,310
- 你要干什么  - 快滚
- What are you doing?  - Let's go!

744
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:14,240
他正试图重连卫星
He is trying to reconnect.

745
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:18,700
各位 信号干扰只能持续很短的时间 马上他就要选另一颗卫星了 你们要加快了
Guys, I can only jam the signal for so long before he chooses another satellite. You have to hurry.

746
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:22,000
我有个想法了
I have a plan.

747
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:25,150
抓紧喽
Hold on!

748
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:26,950
这他妈听起来可不是什么好想法
"Hold on" is no goddamn a plan!

749
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:48,010
嗨
Hi.

750
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:50,880
你是不是在找我？
Are you looking for someone?

751
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:02,710
第二百次碰撞事故！
That's 200!

752
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,510
来追我啊
Haha, come on.

753
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:33,200
桑德 你们得马上赶到顶楼了 他正试图连接另一颗卫星
No! Xander, you guys have to got to the top floor. He is trying to engage another satellite.

754
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:34,660
快点！
Hurry!

755
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:50,290
真是瓮中捉鳖啊
fish in the barrel

756
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:05,640
点四五口径手枪
45 U.S.P

757
01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:07,620
弹容十二发
12 round mag.

758
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:10,460
还有五发
five left

759
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:17,510
还有三发
Three.

760
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:34,860
外面究竟是什么情况
What the hell is going on out there?

761
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:47,860
空了
Empty.

762
01:12:11,930 --> 01:12:15,020
桑德已经过去了 找到目标 一枪毙命
I got Xander in! Find the target, light them up.

763
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:20,660
吉本斯一直说你会回来的
Gibbons thought you'd be back.

764
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:23,870
成为万众瞩目的英雄
To be the hero we needed.

765
01:12:27,190 --> 01:12:30,320
你把它带回国安局
you take the box to NSA

766
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,600
一切就又回到了原点
we are right back to where we started.

767
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:41,080
真是感人啊
This is touching.

768
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:46,130
要是吉本斯在世 他肯定很高兴看到你们两个并肩作战
Gibbons would be proud to see you two working together.

769
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:55,550
想把它拿走 桑德？
walking out of here, Xander.

770
01:12:58,350 --> 01:12:59,980
想知道吉本斯为什么而死么？
you wanna know secret?

771
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:02,370
你是不是忘记涂除臭剂了？
You forgot to put deodorant on?

772
01:13:04,030 --> 01:13:07,650
我之所以杀了吉本斯 是因为他是一个自大的混蛋
I killed Gibbons because he was a self-righteous prick.

773
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:09,410
找到机会开枪了么
Do you have a shot?

774
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:12,770
阿黛尔 找到机会开枪了么
Adele, do you have eyes on the target?

775
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:14,440
没 正在切换热能瞄准镜
I am switching to the thermal.

776
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:17,670
我会让卫星一个个从天而降
I was never going to stop downing satellites

777
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:22,860
谁也不能阻止我 你知道为什么吗 因为这个世界…
no matter what happened, you know why, because this world has turned ...

778
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:25,170
求你马上找到目标
Please, please tell me you have a shot

779
01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:26,660
妈的
Damn it.

780
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,910
他开了暖气 全糊了
He has turned the heat up. I can't see shit

781
01:13:29,110 --> 01:13:31,530
桑德 我看不清那边的情况 热能瞄准镜不好使
X, can't see you guys. thermal is not good.

782
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:33,580
- 我说的对不对？  - 那边一团糊 看不清
- Right?  - I lost them in the heat.

783
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:35,970
你难道不知道这个世界的现状么
you want to see what's going on in this world?

784
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:40,990
- 想想看 换做是你 你要怎么办？  - 别急 我们好好谈谈
- What are you gonna do about it?  - easy.

785
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:44,980
桑德 拖住他 我还没找到机会
X. Keep him talking. I still don't have a shot

786
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:49,190
就是像我 像你们两个 像吉本斯这样的人把世界搞得一团糟
We made it that way, people like Gibbons and two of you. And me.

787
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:51,330
都是我们的错
We made it that way.

788
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:55,430
试想一下 你一觉醒来发现世界都…
What's the point of getting up in the morning if you're not gonna reboot the world

789
01:13:55,730 --> 01:13:56,840
你说的没错
right, okay, easy

790
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:00,200
世界上许多地方 数百万人们挣扎着求生
There's a war out there, a world war for our survival.

791
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,720
你还不明白么 他们的死毫无意义
You don't see it? Millions of people have died for nothing!

792
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:05,390
看样子你又得欠我一命了
Read between the lines.

793
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,970
- 我说的难道不对么？  - 跟你说句大实话
- Come on, isn't it right?  - I'm going to be honest with you.

794
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:10,270
自从见到你以后 我一直有句话想说
What has been bugging me this whole time

795
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:15,170
貌似你的牙齿中间塞了点东西
is you have got something stuck in between your teeth.

796
01:14:15,370 --> 01:14:17,910
- 你说啥 扯什么淡呢？  - 我是认真的
- What? What the hell are you talking about?  - I'm serious.

797
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:19,320
你脑子没问题吧
What the hell is wrong with you?

798
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:21,870
就在这里
Right ... there.

799
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:29,690
枪法不错啊
Nice shot.

800
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:31,120
你怀疑过我的实力么 哈哈
Was it ever a doubt?

801
01:14:31,790 --> 01:14:34,320
我承认 我刚才是有点怀疑的
Yes, I confess I had my doubts.

802
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:39,740
我可不允许你说我朋友吉本斯的坏话
That's for talking shit about my friend Gibbons.

803
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:54,200
项！跪在地上！
Xiang! Get on your knees! On your knees!

804
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:57,490
举起手来！
Hands! Hands!

805
01:14:58,190 --> 01:14:59,400
马上跪在地上！
On your knees! Now!

806
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,470
来的正好啊
Just in time.

807
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:10,030
注意点 凯奇 小心他们误伤你哟
Watch out. Cage. keep this up, people might mistake you for one of the good guys.

808
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:14,870
嘿 那个当官的
Hey, Suit.

809
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,950
你也拿到你想要的东西了
You got what you wanted.

810
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:23,520
我们也都知道 他不是个坏人
We both know that he is not the bad guy.

811
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,340
你知道 莫斯科爆炸事件的锅该谁背么
You know who would we blame for Moscow?

812
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:29,530
当然是让这个活着的恐怖分子背咯 让我们自己人背锅多不合适
Better a living terrorist than a dead company man.

813
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:31,090
懂了我的意思么
See what I'm saying?

814
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:31,900
走吧
Let's go.

815
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:35,090
把他带回飞机 二十分钟后起飞
Back on the plane. I want wheels up in twenty.

816
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,120
伙计们 走吧
Let's go boys.

817
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:44,230
我们拿到“潘多拉魔盒”了
We recover Pandora's Box.

818
01:15:44,530 --> 01:15:47,170
他们会派一个小队去接你们
They will send an extraction team to pick you guys up.

819
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:49,100
项在他们手上
But they are taking Xiang.

820
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,760
塞丽娜
And Serena ...

821
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:54,860
如果你联系不上我 记得按九号键
you don't hear from me, remember, dial 9.

822
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,070
极限特工间会相互照应的
X takes care of its own.

823
01:15:57,530 --> 01:15:59,450
你是不是把盒子给那个当官的了？
You gave it back to Marke, didn't you?

824
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:12,870
这飞机不错啊 这么宽敞 肯定造价昂贵吧
nice place. spacious, expensive.

825
01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:14,270
闭嘴吧你
Shut up.

826
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:25,020
谢谢长官
Thank you, sir.

827
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:28,520
是的 伤亡降至最低 极限特工
Yes, minimal casualties. Triple-X performed ...

828
01:16:28,730 --> 01:16:31,320
表现十分出色 超出预期
beyond any reasonable measured expectation.

829
01:16:45,070 --> 01:16:46,650
让我猜猜看
Let me guess.

830
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:50,320
是不是总统邀请我去办公室坐坐呢
That was my invitation to the Oval Office.

831
01:16:55,090 --> 01:16:58,510
十分钟前 极限特工项目已正式取消
10 minutes ago, the Triple-X program was officially shuttered.

832
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:03,270
所有特工记录已被清除 你们现在是国家公敌了
All active agents should be erased from record, and considered enemies of the state.

833
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:08,220
我建议你们不要拿枪指着我
It is just never a good idea to point a gun on me.

834
01:17:13,190 --> 01:17:16,930
国安局的接应分队一般都是这么全副武装的？
NSA extraction teams normally armed like they invading Fallujah?

835
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:19,450
一般来说不会的 盯紧他们
No, generally not. Watch the boys.

836
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:23,760
妈的
Shit.

837
01:17:24,330 --> 01:17:28,210
不会真是那样吧 他们会朝我们开枪吧？
Oh, it's happening, isn't it? They're going to shoot at us, aren't they?

838
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:29,890
我们撤
Let's go!

839
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,360
好戏开始喽
It's showtime.

840
01:17:32,530 --> 01:17:34,140
看起来我们又要并肩作战了
I guess we are on the same team now.

841
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:35,580
给我把枪
Give me one.

842
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:41,280
你懂我的 搞定他们不是问题
You know me. Wind me up, pointing the right direction.

843
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:42,970
走吧！
Let's go!

844
01:17:43,270 --> 01:17:46,890
妈的这是要玩真的啊！
That shit is getting real! Does this happen when shit goes real?

845
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:48,280
我们要怎么办
What do we do?

846
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,570
准备开枪自卫吧
Just with bullets on.

847
01:17:51,190 --> 01:17:54,300
遗憾的是 恐怖分子最后一次激活了潘多拉魔盒
Sadly, the terriost activated Pandora's Box ...

848
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:57,170
我们无法阻止他了
one last time before we could stop him.

849
01:17:57,470 --> 01:18:02,010
你和你的小队在爆炸中全数牺牲 盒子也被摧毁了
you and your entire team lost in the blast along with the device itself.

850
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:05,840
如果全世界都以为潘多拉魔盒已经彻底毁了
If the world thinks Pandora's Box has gone

851
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:08,980
他们就不知道我们还能用它监视他们
then they won't know we are using it to spy on them.

852
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,870
你只不过是一个暴君罢了
You're just another tyrant.

853
01:18:11,370 --> 01:18:13,150
不 我是一个爱国者
No. patriot.

854
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:15,410
让我来告诉你二者的区别是什么
Let me educate you on the difference.

855
01:18:16,110 --> 01:18:17,110
桑德！
Xander!

856
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:20,780
桑德！
Xander!

857
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:29,970
桑德 他们说这是你最后一次极限挑战了 记得给我寄明信片哟
They say it is the last great adventure, cage. Be sure send me a postcard.

858
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:31,740
- 准备起飞！  - 出发吧
- engines hot!  - Oh right let's go!

859
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,040
桑德！
Xander!

860
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:35,000
桑德·凯奇！
Xander Cage!

861
01:18:39,070 --> 01:18:40,670
- 快跑！  - 大家分散躲好！
- Go, go!  - Everybody spread out!

862
01:18:40,870 --> 01:18:42,880
大家躲好！
Take cover! Move!

863
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:47,680
大家躲好！
There, take cover!

864
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:08,610
真刺激啊
What a rush.

865
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:12,330
还好有贝奇给我的防弹护甲
Damn, Becky, that's a body armor.

866
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:20,730
嘿 我跟你说你真是不知羞耻
Hey, I told you that you got no manners.

867
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:24,720
你妈妈没教过你穿裤子要拉拉链么
Did your mother ever teach you how to zip up your pants?

868
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:34,140
不错啊
Well

869
01:19:44,190 --> 01:19:45,190
塞丽娜
Serena.

870
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:47,050
我这边现在有点忙
We're a bit busy now!

871
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:51,330
潘多拉魔盒在那个当官的手上 她应该会让一颗卫星坠毁在你们那里
Marke has got Pandora's Box. She is gonna drop a satellite on top of you.

872
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:54,980
她要让一个卫星坠毁在我们这边
She is going to drop a satellite on us!

873
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:58,230
我可以暂时干扰一下信号
Not if I jam the signal!

874
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,600
给我找个电源
I need a power source!

875
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:05,340
去啊！
Go!

876
01:20:05,490 --> 01:20:07,330
去那边？就我一个人？
Over there? By myself?

877
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:12,660
去啊！
Go!

878
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,070
掩护我！
Cover me!

879
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:22,890
快点！去那边！
Hurry up! Over there!

880
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:36,010
我解决下面的
I'll go low.

881
01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:37,630
那上面的交给我
I'll go high.

882
01:20:38,230 --> 01:20:40,380
我们去找那个特种大兵算算账吧
See if we can find G.I. Joe.

883
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:07,000
你那边受到信号干扰了么
Are you getting signal interference?

884
01:21:59,630 --> 01:22:00,750
妈的
Shit.

885
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,110
看样子你也要把枪防身啊
Everyone needs back up, right?

886
01:22:13,570 --> 01:22:15,110
说的对
Yeah, I guess.

887
01:22:51,730 --> 01:22:53,130
来打一架啊
Let's do this.

888
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:49,640
尼克斯！
Nicks!

889
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,570
- 我有个想法了  - 别乱来！
- I got a plan.  - No!

890
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:55,380
别乱来！
No!

891
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:19,270
听我说 从现在开始听我的 我告诉你要怎么做 你再行动
Listen, from now on, I make the plans, you act ***!

892
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:28,400
妈的
Oh shit.

893
01:26:10,430 --> 01:26:13,330
我的天 这真是他妈的太刺激了
Oh my god, this is fucking awesome!

894
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:30,250
混蛋 你脑子有坑吧 你就不该回来的
What's wrong asshole? Why do you come back?

895
01:26:30,550 --> 01:26:33,170
不不 我终于想通了那个数学问题
No, I just finally figure out that maths problem.

896
01:26:46,870 --> 01:26:49,160
想把你丢出去可真是费力啊
It's gonna take two flushes.

897
01:26:56,330 --> 01:26:58,550
妈的 他们人数太多了 我们要撤出去
Oh shit, way too many. Let's get out of here.

898
01:27:00,870 --> 01:27:01,900
快 撤到这边
Get back

899
01:27:03,580 --> 01:27:04,580
妈的
Oh shit

900
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:06,850
我不想死
I don't want to die

901
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:15,510
冲冲冲
Forward, push!

902
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:19,380
子弹都打完了 只能玩刀子了
This is all we've got.

903
01:27:22,730 --> 01:27:24,580
我子弹用完了 你们还有么
I am out of bullets! You got any?

904
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:26,600
没了
No, nothing.

905
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:30,130
我也没子弹了
I am empty!

906
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:35,970
数到三一起冲
We go on three.

907
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:19,460
咋没人说话呢
What's up?

908
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:26,060
我的火箭筒不给力么
Rock, paper, scissors ... grenade launcher.

909
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:29,440
德瑞斯·斯通
Darius Stone.

感谢出手相助！
Thanks for the assist!

915
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:42,380
极限特工会相互照应的
X takes care of its own.

916
01:29:14,110 --> 01:29:15,710
这简直就是逗我啊
You got to be kidding.

917
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:35,250
[选择卫星]

918
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:50,300
我们失败了
We failed.

919
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:59,110
桑德 马克激活了“潘多拉魔盒” 有一个卫星正在坠向我们这边
Xander, Marke activated the satellite and it headed towards us.

920
01:29:59,610 --> 01:30:01,640
看起来我要玩一把自杀性撞击了
I'm gonna have to take it to kamikaze style.

921
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:05,060
别 那无异于自杀 你可能没法幸存的
Do not do it. It is suicide. Nobody could survive that fall.

922
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,490
叫尼克斯准备好录像吧
Tell Nicks have that camera ready.

923

01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:41,310
没有录像的话没人会相信的
If it ain't no video, it did not happen!

931
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:44,480
放心好啦 我全录下来了 兄弟
Oh, yeah. Hall of Fame right here, bro.

932
01:32:46,010 --> 01:32:48,860
- 我跟你说 这种杂技我也玩得来  - 你就使劲吹吧
- You know, I could have done that, right?  - Bullshit.

933
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:53,480
马克怎么样了
What happened to Marke?

934
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:55,570
自由落体 摔死喽
The ground broke her fall.

935
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:26,000
你还是不相信好人嘛？
Still you do not believe in good guys?

936
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:29,560
有时候有点坏还是不错的
It is okay to feel a little bad.

937
01:33:35,630 --> 01:33:37,150
那是多坏呢
How bad?

938
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:09,200
我觉得吧 兄弟
Now, that right there...

939
01:34:09,870 --> 01:34:11,960
你这个进场仪式可真是不错啊
that was a hell of an entrance

940
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:14,880
你的车也不错嘛
That's a hell of car.

941
01:34:16,570 --> 01:34:18,860
吉本斯叫我好好保管这辆车
Gibbons told me to keep an eye on it.

942
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:21,850
他说等我用上它的那天 我就会明白为什么要保管好它了
He said I would know why when I need to know why.

943
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:24,700
现在我明白了
now I know why.

944
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,360
车保存的很好啊 和我当时离开的时候一模一样
It is exactly the way I left it.

945
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:29,310
我就开出去约会了一两次
took it on a date or two

946
01:34:30,650 --> 01:34:32,580
极限特工间相互照应嘛 哈哈
X takes care of its own.

947
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:34,770
所以我知道你会来帮我们的
That's why I figured you'll come through.

948
01:34:34,970 --> 01:34:38,340
当然 毕竟能有幸同传奇的桑德·凯奇并肩作战
To get a chance to work with the legendary Xander Cage?

949
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:40,270
你要不要来给我签个名呢
Where do I sign up?

950
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:53,700
你应该知道 你这次可是惹了一大帮人
You know you pissed a wrong damn picnic

951
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:56,200
全世界都会来追捕我们的
The whole world will be looking for us

952
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:03,320
我也无路可选了
I wouldn't have any other way.

953
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:48,710
你以为就你一个人知道怎么装死？
Think you are the only one knows how to play dead?

954
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:52,600
可算是找到你了
Gotcha.

955
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:59,560
能亲自参加自己的葬礼 可真是离奇啊
It's pretty surreal to be on my own funeral.

956
01:36:59,850 --> 01:37:02,300
♫ 我觉得 ♫
♪ And I think to myself ♪

957
01:37:02,590 --> 01:37:05,600
♫ 世界真美好 ♫
♪ What a wonderful World ♪

958
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:08,620
这首歌真不错
I love that song.

959
01:37:10,550 --> 01:37:12,840
如果坏人不再作恶
And it could be a wonderful world ...

960
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:15,360
这个世界的确挺美好的
if we stop doing bad shit to it.

961
01:37:17,930 --> 01:37:20,750
如果你想让我重出江湖 你就直接说一声吧 何必这么大费周章
If you wanted me out of retirement, you could have just asked, man.

962
01:37:21,370 --> 01:37:24,980
不给你一点动力你哪会出山呢
You've always responded to less subtle motivation.

963
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:28,190
是么？
now what?

964
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:31,390
你就先当个全民公敌 虽然世界暂时不知道你所存在的价值 但总有一天他们会明白的
You keep being a rebel the world doesn't know it needs.

965
01:37:31,750 --> 01:37:35,300
你可以监督高官 消灭内部敌人
Watches the watchers, fight the enemy within.

966
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:37,390
妈的 那可真是复杂啊
Damn, that's so complicated.

967
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:38,670
真的么
Really?

968
01:37:39,630 --> 01:37:41,570
其实也没那么复杂 我这么说吧
Let me simplify for you.

969
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:43,890
杀坏蛋
kick some ass

970
01:37:44,290 --> 01:37:45,540
泡美女
Get the girl.

971
01:37:46,290 --> 01:37:49,600
泡妞时记得耍帅就行了
And try to look dope while you are doing it.

972
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:53,520
你最擅长这些吧？
You can do dope, can't you?

973
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,620
我懂你的
Sure you can.

974
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:02,140
走吧
Junior, let's go!

975
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:04,530
有缘再见 桑德
I will see you there, X.

976
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:12,160
说的对 这些我都玩得来
I can definitely make that work.

977
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:20,000
