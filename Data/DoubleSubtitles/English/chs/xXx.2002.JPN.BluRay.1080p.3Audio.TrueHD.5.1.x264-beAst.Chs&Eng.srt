132
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:45,880
- 这到底是怎么回事？ - 这是测验，你高分通过了
- What the hell is going on here?  - lt was a test that you aced.

133
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,550
- 他的态度不太好  - 什么？
- He seems to have a poor attitude.  - Excuse me?

134
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,350
- 要不要把他扔回去？ - 不，我喜欢他的态度
- Should we throw him back?  - Hell, no. I love his attitude.

135
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,520
进行下一步，快去联络
Let's take this to the next level. Get on the Sat-Com.

136
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,860
什么下一步？
Take what to the next level?

137
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,230
- 什么下一步？ - 全员十分钟内离去
- Yo! Take what?  - I want everybody out in 10 minutes.

138
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,270
我不奉陪
I don't play this game.

139
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,930
- 送麦克就医，否则他脸就毁了  - 我还要回派对去
- Get Mike a doctor or he'll look like me.  - I got a party.

140
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,580
- 让他闭嘴  - 别忘了赔我窗户的钱
- Shut him up.  - And pay for my windows!

141
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,850
怎么通过测验的老是些烂人？
Why is it always the assholes who pass the tests?

142
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,440
你们最近不会都到过餐厅吧？
You guys haven't been to any diners lately, huh?

143
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,480
餐厅胜出者
Diner finalists.

144
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,890
- 怎么，没咖啡啊？ - 好耶
- What, no coffee?  - Oh, yeah.

145
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,290
- 指挥军官在此  - 开始了
- Here comes the ROTC.  - Here we go.

146
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,970
- 我的花生米呢？ - 酷啊
- Where's my peanuts?  - Nice.

147
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,640
帮我叫空姐过来一下吧
Can you ask for the stewardess?

148
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,940
- 预备放减速伞  - 知道了，减速伞预备
- Standing by to deploy drogue.  - Roger, deploying drogue parachute.

149
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,990
- 这会很痛  - 这是在搞什么？
- This will hurt.  - What the hell?

150
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,700
- 放出减速伞  - 知道了
- Release drogue now.  - Roger.

151
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,040
这不好吧
This ain't right!

152
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,910
这算不了什么！
I live for this shit!

153
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,400
不赖嘛
Not bad!

154
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,470
再来一次吧
Let's do that again!

155
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,650
靠，这里是哥伦比亚
Holy shit. This is Colombia.

156
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,880
可卡因，这些都是可卡因树
Cocaine, man. These are coke plants!

157
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,130
没钥匙
No keys.

158
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,170
- 你在干嘛？ - 这些可值钱了
- What the hell are you doing?  - You know what this shit's worth?

159
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,110
怎么？测验人员来了？
What now? Is this another test?

160
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,580
- 我们过河去，快  - 是啊，快跑吧
- Let's go across the river. Let's go!  - Yeah, good idea! Good idea!

161
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,280
你们真是比我强太多了，我想我测验不及格了
You monkeys are too good for me. I failed this test.

162
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,430
你们有带喝的吗？
You guys got something to drink?

163
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,950
真高兴又见面了
Nice to see you again, fellas.

164
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,880
是啊
Yeah, you too.

165
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,450
他们这回可真是大费周章
Boy, they went all out on this one.

166
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,470
不会吧？
You've got to be kidding.

167
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,560
好了，笨蛋
Okay, funny guys.

168
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,560
见识一下我们怎么处置入侵者吧
I'll show you what we do when you get in our business.

169
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:28,260
绑住我们，逼我们听你讲话？
What? Hog-tie us and force us to listen to your bad accent?

170
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,330
不
No.

171
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:36,000
我们砍断他们的脚筋看着他们痛苦挣扎
We cut their Achilles tendon and watch them flop around like a marionette.

172
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:40,910
除非你有话跟我说重要的情报
Unless you have something to tell me, something I need to know?

173
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,610
好吧，你很矮
Okay. You're short.

174
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:50,580
我朋友说你可以去换个发型，放开我
My friend says you could use a haircut to update your style. Get off me.

175
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,050
闭嘴
Shut up!

176
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,190
你刚刚才叫我们讲话，现在却要闭嘴？
Two seconds ago you told us to talk. Now it's "Shut up?"

177
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,660
我无意挑剔，但你真不会逼供
I don't mean to nitpick, but you're the worst at this torture thing.

178
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,440
你再打我，我就扁死你
You slap me again, I'm going to throw you a beating.

179
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,940
希望你这样有领比较多酬劳
I hope they're paying you extra for this.

180
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,440
这样吧，也许我该先割了你的鼻子
You know what, funny guy? Maybe I'll cut off your nose first.

181
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,020
笨蛋
Funny guy.

182
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:28,890
怪了，这上面有真正的血腥味
What's funny is, this actually smells like real blood.

183
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:34,390
希望你喜欢，这会是你最后闻到的东西了
I hope you like it, because it's the last thing you're going to smell.

184
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,050
我中枪了
I'm hit! I'm hit! I'm hit!

185
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,100
维多，快帮忙
Virg! Give me a hand.

186
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,540
我们是哥伦比亚政府军
This is the Colombian army!

187
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,340
快投降，你们已被包围！
Give up, you're surrounded!

188
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,320
自己走，小杰
Try to walk, T.J. Try to walk.

189
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,290
维多，快走
Virg! Get out here!

190
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,960
去他的，人不为己天诛地灭
To hell with this. Every man for himself.

191
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,590
我去找交通工具
I'll get us some wheels.

192
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,880
在这等着
Hang in there.

193
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,110
祝好运
Good luck.

194
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,790
那个骑机车的就是毒枭！
The guy on the bike, that's the drug lord!

195
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,300
快逮住他！
Let's get him!

196
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,910
小杰
T.J.!

197
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:02,060
X，我在这里
X! I'm over here! X!

198
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,850
他在那里！
There he is!

199
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,150
我们把他烤焦了！
We toasted his ass!

200
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,860
我弄了一辆机车
I got us a bike.

201
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,710
胆小鬼！
Pussies!

202
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:06,590
看谁来了，科学怪人，打开我的手铐，我要扁死你
Look who it is. Frankenstein. Uncuff me so I can beat the shit out of you.

203
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,060
别激动，你刚以第一名毕业
Relax, X, you just graduated at the head of your class.

204
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,890
你在胡说什么？你差点害死我们
What are you talking about? You almost got us killed.

205
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,590
- 我们知道哥国军队正在逼近  - 什么？
- We knew the army was moving.  - Excuse me?

206
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,400
是我建议拿你当诱饵，怎样？
It was my idea to send you as a decoy. How do you like that?

207
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,940
- 你真是个身手矫健的老人  - 起来
- You're pretty fast for an old man.  - Get up.

208
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,540
陪我走一走
Walk with me.

209
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:38,980
我相信只要有好的环境，人是会改变的
I believe under the right circumstances, a man can change.

210
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:43,060
举例来说，昨晚你展现了勇气、领导能力…
For instance, last night you exhibited courage, leadership...

211
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,860
还愿意保护一个陌生人
...and willingness to protect a man you hardly knew.

212
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:49,360
- 颁个勋章给我好了  - 我宁可给你一份工作
- So give me a medal.  - I'd rather give you a job.

213
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:53,570
你看看我，我看来像是执法人员吗？
Look at me. Do I look like a fan of law enforcement?

214
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,070
今天是你的幸运日
This is your lucky day, Xander.

215
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,970
你有机会可以报答国家…
This is your chance to pay your Uncle Sam...

216
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,370
感谢它让你享受自由
...for all your wonderful freedoms.

217
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,380
工作本身并不难
The job's not that difficult.

218
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:07,210
我只是要你去见一些人，查明他们的底细
I want you to meet people and find out what you can about them.

219
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,080
那一种人？
What type of people?

220
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:14,520
危险、下流、野蛮，你们那种人
Dangerous, dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.

221
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,230
等等
Hold up.

222
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:22,890
我这种人会说“去你的，大花脸”
My kind of people would say, "Kiss my ass, scarface."

223
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:27,230
此时我通常会拔枪相向，再礼貌的…
Usually I'd take my gun, press it to your temple...

224
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:30,430
请你照我的话去做
...and ask you very politely to do what I want.

225
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:34,200
但你并不怕死，这让我们陷入了窘境
But you're not afraid of death. That puts us in a quandary.

226
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,900
- 我想讨论就到此结束了  - 还没
- We better call this a day, then.  - Not just yet.

227
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:42,020
你看过动物园里的狮子吗？
You ever watch lions at the zoo?

228
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:47,350
透过它们的眼睛，你就能分辨哪只是野生的
You can tell which were captured in the wild by the look in their eyes.

229
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,620
大野猫
The wild cat.

230
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:52,790
它记得奔驰草原的快乐、猎杀的快感
She remembers running across the plain, the thrill of the hunt.

231
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,900
四百磅的猎杀高手，被关着
Four hundred pounds of killing fury locked in a box.

232
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,400
过一阵子，它们眼神变得呆滞…
But after a while, their eyes glaze over...

233
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,500
你看得出它的灵魂已死
...and you can tell their soul has died.

234
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,200
人也是一样
The same thing happens to a man.

235
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:09,070
联邦监狱可不是儿童乐园
Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary is no joke.

236
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:13,270
他们会把你这种狂人丢进单人牢房取乐
They'll take a wild man and throw him in solitary just for fun.

237
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:19,020
不再有山可爬，不再有浪可冲
No more mountains to board, no more oceans to surf.

238
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:24,490
只有一个小牢房，不见天日，只有一个粪桶
Just a 6-by-8 cell with no window and only a bucket to shit in.

239
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,060
但你只要帮个忙，就能免去一切
You can avoid that by doing me this favor.

240
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,360
你根本没有我的把柄
You don't have shit on me.

241
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:34,490
我注意到你的后颈有三个“X”的刺青
I noticed you have three X's tattooed on the back of your neck.

242
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:40,280
我觉得那满适合你的，因为你背负三项罪名
I think that's rather appropriate since you're looking at three strikes.

243
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:45,080
偷车、危害公安，还有你那个跳桥特技…
Grand theft, reckless endangerment, and that bridge stunt of yours...

244
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,650
让你彻底输了三次
...makes you a three-time loser.

245
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,790
也许你该自称为“XXX”
Maybe you ought to call yourself "Triple X."

246
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:56,450
但如果你照我的话去做，我就让你无罪开释
But if you do what I want, I'll make all your transgressions go away...

247
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:00,260
让你回去过你那可笑的生活
...and let you get back to that pathetic excuse of a life.

248
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,000
或者你认为我该跟你一样
Or you think maybe I should be like you.

249
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:09,400
被打个脸上开花
Get all shot up for the old Stars and Stripes.

250
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:14,310
你每回照镜子时一定很自傲
I bet that flag is a real comfort every time you look in the mirror.

251
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,350
这只是个我为国付出的小代价
A small price I paid for putting foot to ass for my country.

252
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,820
怎么样，XXX？
So, what's it going to be, Triple X?

253
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,480
你想立刻上路…
You want to get on a plane...

254
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:34,360
还是给我一句“去你的，大花脸”？
...or is "Kiss my ass, scarface" your final answer?

255
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,700
[布拉格，捷克]

256
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,090
你叫什么名字？
Yo. What's your name, slick?

257
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,560
我叫伊凡
My name is lvan.

258
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:10,900
- 伊凡？那你呢？ - 我叫伊凡
- lvan? What's your name, buddy?  - My name is lvan.

259
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,800
你们都叫伊凡？
You're both lvan?

260
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,860
坐下
Take a seat.

261
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,300
笨蛋，美国探员呢？
Idiots! Where is the American agent?

262
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,560
这就是了
This is him, Sir.

263
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,800
我们最好再订个装尸袋
We better order another bodybag.

264
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,550
有什么事吗？
Guys, what's up?

265
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,550
我叫你坐下
I told you to sit down.

266
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,750
我在飞机上坐半天了，我想站
I've just been on a plane for 12 hours. I think I'll stand.

267
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,120
我是苏米兰，捷克秘密警察
My name is Milan Sova, Czech secret police.

268
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,850
你到这里，就得受我管辖
Here, you are under my jurisdiction.

269
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,460
你听我的命令，照我的话去做
You take my orders, you do what I say.

270
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:15,120
如果你变得碍手碍脚，我就杀了你
If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.

271
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:18,200
很好，我就住这？
That's great. Is this where I'm staying?

272
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:21,630
你会在此是因你的政府逼我们
Your government is putting pressure on mine.

273
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:25,710
这是一桩国内事务，你们这是干涉捷克内政
This is an internal Czech affair that you are interfering with.

274
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,850
我警告你，别在我家撒野
I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn.

275
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:33,710
取得你们政府想要的情报后，就快点滚
Get whatever information your government seeks and get out.

276
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,680
明人不说暗话
Let's get this straight.

277
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:39,590
你也许不想让我来，而我根本也不想来
You may not want me here, but I definitely don't want to be here.

278
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:43,160
再说，我没受任何人管辖过
Two, I've never been under anyone's jurisdiction.

279
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,190
第三，如果你想杀人…
Three, if you're going to shoot anybody...

280
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,990
去杀卖这套衣服给你的人吧
...shoot that monkey that sold you the suit.

281
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:51,730
我很累，我要睡了
Now, I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

282
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:56,270
三小时后出发
Be ready in three hours.

283
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,680
俱乐部里的人有两个共通点：
Everybody in this club has two things in common:

284
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:09,910
- 他们都很有钱，也都是罪犯  - 我绝对合适，只是我并不有钱
- They're rich and they're criminals.  - I'll fit in, except for the rich part.

285
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,830
- 记住，我们互不相识  - 真希望是如此
- Remember, we don't know each other.  - I wish we didn't.

286
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,540
给我来杯红莓苏打
Yeah, can I get a cranberry club soda?

287
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:49,220
这放后面，我会给你小费
Throw this back there? I'll tip you something.

288
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:51,590
就放后面
Put it in the back.

289
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,900
这要多少？有存根吗？
How much? Do I get a ticket?

290
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,070
他们在那里，“无政府99”
That's them. Anarchy 99.

291
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,110
看见坐在中间沙发那个人了？
You see the guy on the couch?

292
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,750
那就是尤里，他是老大
That's Yorgi. He's the leader.

293
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:13,580
他拥有六间这样的俱乐部，全都是金鸡母
He owns this club and five others like it. All, how do you say, cash cows.

294
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,240
美国佬？！
American?!

295
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,320
我是美国人，我要见尤里，尤里？！
Guys, I'm American. I'm going to see Yorgi. Yorgi!

296
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,860
尤里，听说你就是
Hey, Yorgi! I hear you're the guy...

297
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,930
我听说可以找你买车
I heard you're the guy to talk to about cars.

298
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,530
请你出去
Take yourself outside.

299
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,300
出去？我才刚…
Take myself outside? I'm just...

300
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,730
好吧，我不受欢迎
Okay. I'm not welcome.

301
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:41,470
也许你宁愿条子进你的俱乐部
Guess you'd rather have cops in your club.

302
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,870
想谈谈吗？
Want to talk?

303
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,980
过来告诉我哪个是条子…
Hey, you silly boy. Come with me and show me the cop...

304
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,180
别弄错了
...and don't be mistake.

305
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,760
看到那个傢伙了？穿的很蠢的那个
See that guy there, with the suit made out of drapes?

306
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,660
那个就是条子
That's a cop.

307
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,000
怎么了？我才刚喝一杯
Is there a problem? I just had a drink, you know?

308
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:11,170
我付过钱了，我会给很大一笔小费的
I already paid. I'm going to give a big tip, you know?

309
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,970
这是干嘛？我什么都没做啊
So, what is this all about? I've done nothing.

310
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:24,690
什么都没做？你是做什么的？
You've done nothing? Who do you work for?

311
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:28,160
我在银行工作，怎么？
I work in a bank. So what?

312
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,420
少扯了…
You've got to be....

313
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,430
你干嘛？住手
What are you doing? Stop it! Stop it!

314
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,930
这是什么？学生证吗？
What's that, your bus pass?

315
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,970
捷克警察、捷克警察
Czech 5-0. Czech 5-0.

316
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,430
给我离开
Leave my club.

317
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,250
你怎么知道的？
How did you know?

318
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:55,720
我怎么知道？他付钱的时候，警徽反光差点害我瞎掉
When he was paying for his drinks, he was flashing his badge to half the bar.

319
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,080
条子跟蟑螂一样
Cops like plague.

320
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:01,250
不管收买多少，总还有人要钱
No matter how many you pay, there's always another with his hand out.

321
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,890
我也是混道上的，我暸解
I'm from the streets. I know cops, believe me.

322
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:08,800
我很感谢你引起我们注意，问题是为什么？
I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. My question to you is why?

323
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,130
我想没人喜欢条子混进来
I figure, no one likes cops crashing their party.

324
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,070
我想我帮你忙，就能说上话
I figure, I do you a solid, we could talk.

325
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:19,100
我想买车
I just want to buy cars, man.

326
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,670
这傢伙是不是想上我？
Is this guy going to hump my leg?

327
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,810
你叫什么名字？
What's your name?

328
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,720
桑德凯吉
Xander Cage.

329
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,350
我就知道
I knew it.

330
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,650
你玩滑雪板、机车样样都行
You are amazing on snowboard, motorbike, everything.

331
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,230
- 你真行  - 谢了
- You're awesome.  - Thank you, man.

332
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:44,700
我弟有点疯，他也很崇拜你
My brother is crazy too, and a great admirer of yours.

333
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:48,460
他看过很多你的带子，来谈吧
He has seen your tapes many times. Now we can talk business.

334
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,200
请这边来
This way, please.

335
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,540
约娜
Yelena.

336
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,680
欢迎进入桑德特区
Welcome to the Xander zone.

337
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,120
有趣，真有趣
Now, that's funny. That's funny.

338
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:03,190
坐，凯吉先生
Sit down, Mr. Cage.

339
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,010
我朋友都叫我X
My friends call me X.

340
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,910
X，你想要什么？
So, X, what exactly are you wanting?

341
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:13,450
法拉利，高级跑车，先买十辆
Ferraris, high-end pasta rockets, 10 to start.

342
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,660
这辆车，第十辆，在欧洲很难找
This car, number 10, will be very difficult to find in Europe.

343
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,130
那辆是我要的，我把它列进去是想从中获利
That one's for me. I put it in there to get something out of the deal.

344
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,960
你果然很懂车
Well, you certainly know your cars.

345
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:31,660
是啊，汽车、机车、滑板，我全都行
Yeah. Cars, bikes, boards. You name it.

346
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:35,000
我喜欢快速又能耍特技的东西
I like anything fast enough to do something stupid in.

347
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,200
是啊
Yes.

348
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,840
十辆车根本没利润可言，我们出价一百五十万美金
Ten cars is hardly worth the effort. A lousy 1 .5 million, U.S.

349
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,380
等一等
Now, hold on a second.

350
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:48,780
对我背后的美国金主而言，这十辆只是开胃小菜
The American buyers I represent, to them, 10 cars is an appetizer.

351
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,690
- 最多一百万，阿姐  - 一百四吧
- And it's a mil max, sister.  - How about a million four?

352
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,160
我想最多一百二
I was thinking more like a mil two.

353
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:01,230
你知道什么是电汇吗？
Do you know what a wire transfer is?

354
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,130
她不是来闹场的吧？
Is she for real?

355
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,070
阿姐，你没别的事好做了吗？
Sweetheart, is there anything you need to do?

356
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,370
男人谈生意女人少插嘴
Let us big boys have a conversation.

357
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,210
谈生意是要用大脑的
"Conversation," a word with four syllables.

358
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,440
你要不要先去装个脑袋？
Do you want some ice before your brain overheats?

359
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:20,710
是啊，你也先去装颗心吧，如果你找得到心的话
Ice. Yeah, you could chisel some off your heart, if you could find it.

360
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:30,720
一切会尽快进行，只要你给我帐号
This would work a lot faster, princess, if I had an account number.

361
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,470
你有四十八小时的时间汇款
You have 48 hours to complete the transfer.

362
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,510
- 别浪费我的时间  - 喔，我哪敢
- Don't waste my time.  - I wouldn't dream of it.

363
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:48,480
事实上，我会多汇几块送你上礼仪学校
I might throw in a couple extra bucks and send you to charm school.

364
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,620
生意谈完，来狂欢吧
Now that business is finished, we party.

365
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,190
辣妹们，进来吧
Bitches, come!

366
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,050
喂？
Yeah?

367
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,090
靠，我以为这只是手机
Shit, I thought this was a cell phone.

368
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,320
睡的甜吧？
Have a nice rest?

369
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,430
小声点，我一小时前才睡
Dial it down. I got to sleep an hour ago.

370
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,700
我们给你一份特别准备的清单，谁教你变更的？
You were given a specific list of cars. Who told you to alter it?

371
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:48,810
清单上的车很烂，他们会看穿
The cars sucked. They would've seen through it.

372
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,670
你们真该换旅行社
You guys should switch travel agents.

373
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,270
我已经弄到你要的情报了
I got that info you wanted.

374
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,470
等一等
Hang on a second.

375
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,040
准备好了？
You guys ready for this?

376
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:07,620
姓名、生日、红军军阶
Names, birthdays, ranks in the Red Army.

377
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,130
爱吃的东西？你怎么弄到的？
Favorite foods? How did you get this?

378
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:14,290
柯亚，尤里的小弟，他刚好是极限运动的爱好者
Kolya, Yorgi's younger brother, happens to be an action sports fanatic.

379
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,030
所以他很崇拜我
So naturally, he's a fan.

380
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,900
等他猛灌三瓶伏特加之后，他就无话不说了
But when you kill a bottle of vodka in three swigs, you'll talk.

381
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,040
- 我还有东西要给你  - 什么？
- I got something else.  - What?

382
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:26,010
他们的个人银行帐号，我放到哪里去了？
Their personal bank account number. Where did I put that?

383
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,320
偷车、夜总会、应召站、勒索
Stolen cars, nightclubs, prostitution, extortion.

384
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:38,080
这些人有什么特别的？这种人我们美国多的是
What's the big deal? We got criminals like this in the U.S.

385
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,660
你负责搜集情报，不是问问题
Your job isn't to ask questions.

386
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:44,860
我功成身退，谢谢，我要回家了
Well, I did my job, thank you. I'm coming home.

387
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,260
还没
Not just yet.

388
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:51,000
你的称职害了你自己，我要你接近这些人
You're a victim of your own success. Get closer to these guys.

389
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:54,400
- 这些人是酷，但还不够酷  - 更深入一点
- They're cool, but not that cool.  - Go deeper.

390
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:57,240
我会派人带些道具去帮你
I'll send a guy with a care package to help you.

391
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:02,180
- 我以为我们谈好的  - 你变更车子，我变更交易
- I thought we had a deal.  - You change cars, I change the deal.

392
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:04,540
帮我这个忙，你就能回家
Do this for me, you can come home.

393
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:10,050
你要派人拯救世界，也要确定那人喜欢这世界
If you send someone to save the world, make sure they like it the way it is.

394
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:25,330
我的胸肌很壮，我推举都举两百二十五磅
I have a really firm chest. I bench, like, 225.

395
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:28,340
推举，在举重室
Like, bench. Weight room. Bye.

396
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:32,970
- 就是他  - 等等，你就是XXX？
- That's him.  - Wait. You're Triple X?

397
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,810
- 你就是送道具的？ - 对，李托比探员
- You're the care package?  - Agent Toby Lee Shavers.

398
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,250
来吧
Come on.

399
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:41,980
纪本会送货来，你一定很重要
You have to rate high to get Gibbons to send this stuff.

400
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:47,060
我真希望能跟你一起行动，实地打击罪犯
I kind of wish I was going with you, mixed up in the fury of the situation.

401
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:50,420
这真够猛的，杀人、毁灭、搞破坏
Crazy. License to kill, death, destruction, mayhem.

402
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:55,560
枕头底下放枪，超级大坏蛋随时都可能跳出来
Got a gun under your pillow. Never know when some freak villain will pop out.

403
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:59,330
- 你当探员多久了？ - 两天
- How long you been with the agency?  - Two days.

404
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:02,100
靠，不会吧
You're shitting me. No way.

405
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:04,370
真差劲
That sucks.

406
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:07,110
是很差劲，但比坐牢好多了
Yeah, it sucks, but it beats jail.

407
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,550
差劲的是，我耗了六年时间
It sucks because I spent six years...

408
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:14,240
待在暗无天日的道具室里
...in the basement of some windowless, NSA, gadget freak room, man.

409
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,910
我有学位，我是麻省理工的
And I got a degree. I got a degree from MIT.

410
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:19,960
我是第一名毕业的
Phi Beta Kappa, magna cum laude.

411
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,930
而他们挑中你的原因
And they probably picked you up, what,

412
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:24,930
是你在牢里很会扛砖头？
pumping iron in San Quentin?

413
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:28,430
你有没有因为多话被扁过？
You ever get punched in the face for talking too much?

414
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,830
把东西拿给我看
Show me the stuff.

415
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:34,670
这是我的精心杰作，完美的典范
This one made my career, the definition of perfection:

416
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:38,240
多目标多功能连发手枪
My multi-purpose, multi-function field revolver.

417
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:43,750
- 我喜欢  - 那你会爱死这些
- Oh, I like this.  - Then you'll love these.

418
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,250
这些是附属子弹，什么都有，看见绿色的了？
These are all attachment darts. See the green ones?

419
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,590
麻醉子弹
Datura knockout darts.

420
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,750
碰！中弹者会倒下十二小时，醒来后不知身在何处…
Guy goes down for 12 hours, wakes up, doesn't know who he is...

421
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:57,190
他会头痛欲裂
...and his head's splitting like a cord of firewood.

422
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,360
我被那种子弹打中两次
I was shot twice by those.

423
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:04,030
还有红色的，这是镇静喷血弹
And the red ones are tranquilizer and blood-splatter darts.

424
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,110
中弹后的假死样子很逼真，跟死了一样
Looks like a kill shot without the aftereffects. Like death.

425
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,840
还有爆破弹、无线电追踪弹…
You've got exploding and surveillance darts...

426
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:15,210
还有标准的点四四子弹，如果你想开杀戒的话
...and your standard .44-caliber bullets, if you want to get nasty.

427
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:19,440
喷洒点鲜血，你懂我在说什么吧？
A little wet work. You know what I'm talking about, right?

428
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,950
你一定抢过便利商店吧？
Knocked over a few 7-Elevens, have we?

429
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:31,190
没，到是腿上上过石膏，我只能在家玩射击电玩
No, I had my leg in a cast for three months. All I did was play video games.

430
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:33,160
真是个悲伤的故事
That's a really sad story.

431
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:35,490
好吧，看看我的宝贝
Check this out, on to my baby.

432
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:40,940
鹰眼，有九种视觉强化模式
Eagle Eyes. Nine enhanced-vision modes.

433
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:45,200
每个小男孩的梦想，透视模式
Every little boy's dream: the penetrator mode.

434
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,570
看看吧
Check it out.

435
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,680
乖乖
Oh, my God.

436
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:01,390
- 她在看你  - 这个我要了
- She's checking you out, man.  - I'll hang on to these.

437
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:04,090
接着，我最新的发明
Now, on to my latest achievement.

438
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:07,830
我上周才完成的
I just put the finishing touches on them last week.

439
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,030
怎样？
What do you think?

440
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:13,270
- 绷带  - 不，你看着
- Bandages?  - No, Mr. X, watch and learn.

441
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,570
上面的火药足以炸穿墙壁…
There's enough primer to blow a hole in a vault...

442
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:20,610
炸死人，或任何你想炸的东西
...vaporize a human, or whatever agents like you might find a use for.

443
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:22,520
你看看
And check this out.

444
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,080
这是引爆器，够酷吧？
The detonator. How cool is that?

445
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:31,290
- 你最好退后一点  - 那只是绷带罢了
- You might want to back up for this.  - lt's a bandage.

446
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,730
躲到墙后
Just get behind the wall.

447
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:36,890
准备好了？
You ready?

448
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,190
我一直想说这句话
I've always wanted to say this.

449
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,130
引爆
Fire in the hole.

450
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:07,190
子弹已经上膛
It's loaded.

451
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:33,010
- 怎样？ - 太棒了
- So, what do you think?  - Beautiful.

452
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:35,850
你喜欢这些车？
You like the cars?

453
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,320
我喜欢，真棒
I love the cars, they're dope.

454
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:44,260
- 你喜欢那笔钱吧？ - 我喜欢，但我还没拿到
- You like the money?  - I love money, but I do not have it.

455
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:48,990
你看来混的不错，这些手下、名车
You look like you're doing very well. All these employees, beautiful cars.

456
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,430
我没时间跟你胡扯
This is no time for being funny.

457
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,510
[帐户余额 120万]

458
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,300
[款项收讫]

459
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:09,780
- 你不会以为我会赖帐吧？ - 我想都没想过
- You didn't think I wasn't good for it?  - lt never crossed my mind.

460
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:16,220
港口有艘货轮在等着，这是地址
A cargo ship's waiting for you in Rijeka. Here's the address.

461
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:20,560
这里真棒
This place is dope.

462
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:24,060
这辆是我的？
This one's mine?

463
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,730
第十辆
Car number 10.

464
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:29,970
柯亚在柏林找到的，它很难找
Kolya found it hiding in Berlin. It was very difficult to find.

465
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,740
不，拜托
No! Please.

466
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:35,140
让我来，你很慷慨的付了钱
Allow me. You were kind enough to give me the money.

467
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,850
请你…
Now, please...

468
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:46,820
开车吧
...drive.

469
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:52,730
不，让我来
No, allow me.

470
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:09,410
- 你挺正点的，尤里  - 有伏特加一切好办
- You're all right, Yorgi.  - Everything's all right with vodka.

471
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:13,920
请你今晚务必来参加派对，就在我的俱乐部里
You must come to party tonight. Big party at one of my clubs.

472
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:15,550
- 是吗？ - 没错
- Yeah?  - Yes.

473
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,900
怎么回事？
What's going on, my friend?

474
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,380
我不知道，你说呢，你上面是不是有埋伏人？
You tell me. You got a sniper up there or what?

475
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,880
他不是我们的人，是跟你来的
He's not with us, he must be with you.

476
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:47,110
胡扯，叫你的人下来
Bullshit! Tell your men to get down...

477
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:51,050
不然我就在你身上多开一个洞，听清楚了？
...or I'll give you another hole to breathe out of. Are we clear?

478
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:59,230
好吧，他不是你的人
All right. It's not yours.

479
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:01,560
我们一起去逮他吧
Let's go and get him together.

480
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:38,170
妈的，是之前闯俱乐部的条子
Son of a bitch. That same cop from the club.

481
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:39,960
烂条子
Filthy cop.

482
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,710
很多人会放狠话，但能冷静行动的人不多
Most people talk a lot. Few are up for the moment.

483
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:17,210
欢迎你加入“无政府99”
Welcome to Anarchy 99.

484
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:11,190
你干嘛这么对待自己？香烟迟早会要了你的命
Why do you do that to yourself? That cigarette will kill you one day.

485
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:15,200
我喜欢烟雾胜于空气，可以的话，我连睡觉都想吸烟
I like smoke better than air. If I could, I'd smoke in my sleep.

486
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:18,270
就算它害死我，我死后还想抽
I would still do it after it kills me.

487
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:39,220
你之前提到无政府
You were talking about Anarchy 99.

488
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:42,330
那是什么？你的机车俱乐部？
What is that, some motorcycle gang of yours?

489
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,300
是我们九九年离开祖国红军后所过的日子
It's what we've been living since 1999 when we left the army of Mother Russia.

490
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:53,300
我们有许多同志死于战争，我们受够这一切了
Many of our comrades died in combat, and we said, "To hell with this shit."

491
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:55,910
他们为何而死？政治？
They die for what? Politics?

492
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,600
谁的政治？不是我们的
Whose politics? Not ours!

493
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:02,910
所以我们当下决定，从此要为所欲为
So we decide from then on to do what we want, when we want.

494
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:07,420
为纪念他们，我们自称“无政府99”
It is in their honor we call ourselves Anarchy 99.

495
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,290
有首老庞克歌曲，歌词说：
You know, there's an old punk song. It says:

496
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,620
美国代表自由
The United States on behalf of freedom

497
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:20,360
但你若自以为自由
But if you think you're free

498
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:23,830
去趟小吃店，在小菜上撒泡尿
Go to the snack bar, Piss on the side dishes

499
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,770
- 你知道！ - 汪达合唱团的“无政府汉堡”
- You got it!  - "Anarchy Burger" by the Vandals.

500
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:31,270
我赞成你，但你要怎么做？
I'm with you, but what are you going to do?

501
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,210
到处都有法规、都有政府，以前有，以后也会一直有
You got rules and government everywhere. Always was, always will be.

502
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,180
也许不会一直有
Maybe not always.

503
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,150
别让他寂寞
Make sure he doesn't get lonely.

504
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,120
放开一点
Don't be shy.

505
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,030
想跳舞吗？
You want to dance?

506
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:06,480
喂，喂！
Hey. Hey!

507
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,810
喂！我舞技很棒的
Hey! I'm really a good dancer.

508
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:23,390
来两杯
Make that two.

509
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:27,300
好吧，你打算一直这样对我？
All right, it's going to be like that?

510
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,900
你气他，也别拿我出气啊
If you're mad at him, don't take it out on me.

511
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:36,670
我一直在想你们俩的关系
I've been trying to figure out the deal between you two all night.

512
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,970
你是他的女人？
You his woman or what?

513
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:44,510
对，我是，若付我一样多钱，我也能跟你
Yeah, I'm his woman. If you pay me as much, I'll be your woman too.

514
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,060
- 你喜欢吗？ - 喜欢
- Did you enjoy that?  - Yeah.

515
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:42,170
很好，因为它不会再发生了
Good, because it will never happen again.

516
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:44,870
原来的堡主有一天决定落跑
The original owners just one day decide to move out.

517
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,870
- 这里真棒  - 请不要拘礼
- This is amazing, man.  - Make yourself at home.

518
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:56,880
我帮你拿外套
Let me get your coat.

519
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,320
那小子怎么了？他喜欢外套？
What's up with your boy? He got a coat fetish?

520
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:09,220
不
Oh, no.

521
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,460
他爱上她了，笨蛋
He's in love with her. Dirty fool.

522
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:29,170
该上床了，天快亮了，约娜！
Time for bed, X. It's getting early. Yelena!

523
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,440
你带他去他的房间吧
Would you kindly show him his room?

524
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,230
- 你先请  - 不，你先
- After you.  - No, after you.

525
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,170
- 不，你先  - 不，我坚持
- No, after you.  - No, I insist.

526
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,570
这里就是了
That's it.

527
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,620
跟我上床的最后一次机会
Last chance to tuck me in.

528
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:08,820
祝你好梦
Good morning.

529
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:01,770
我要为国奋战一番
The things I'm going to do for my country.

530
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:36,100
这不关我的事，但是用电钻…
It's none of my business, but a power drill and some titanium bits...

531
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:38,070
会比用相机有用多了
...will get you a lot further than that camera.

532
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,470
你不该在这里的
You're not supposed to be in here.

533
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,730
我本来是想去上厕所
I was on my way to the bathroom.

534
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:47,110
你的藉口呢？
What's your excuse?

535
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:49,800
我不需要藉口
I don't need an excuse.

536
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:53,980
你真行
Oh, you're good.

537
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:57,320
但还不够行
But not that good.

538
00:59:57,490 --> 01:00:00,820
我是来拍摄尤里的保险箱
I came in here to photograph Yorgi's safe.

539
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:03,660
因为我觉得它可能很值钱
I thought it might be worth a lot to somebody.

540
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:07,530
拜托，你冷血、聪明又危险
Come on. You're cold, intelligent and vicious.

541
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,700
你的眼神泄露了你的身分
It's your eyes that give you away.

542
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,670
就在我射杀那条子的时候
They gave you away when I shot that cop.

543
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:20,240
你现在打算怎么做？
What are you going to do now?

544
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:27,180
我现在要请你吃午餐
Now I'm going to take you to lunch.

545
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:32,450
还有，我杀的那个条子，他没死
Oh, and that cop I shot, isn't dead.

546
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,570
我有情报要给你
I have some information for you.

547
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:02,410
我一直都用得上情报，你是谁？你怎会有我的号码？
I can always use information. Who is this? How did you get this number?

548
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:08,830
关于桑德凯吉的重要情报
Yes. Important information that you need about Xander Cage.

549
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,240
- 你不喜欢外国人？ - 没错，你是一只猪
- So you don't like foreigners, do you?  - No, you're a pig.

550
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:26,600
你的相好呢？他也是猪？
Is your boyfriend a pig too?

551
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:29,370
你应该认得你的同类啊
You should recognize one of your kind.

552
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:31,380
告诉我条子的事
Now, tell me about the cop.

553
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:37,110
若我说我跟你想像的不一样，你会怎么说？
What if I told you I'm not who you think I am?

554
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:40,450
我可以帮你解决你的问题
That I could get you out of the mess you're in?

555
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:42,890
是吗？我有什么问题？
Really? And what mess am I in?

556
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:48,160
它让你趁大家熟睡时，蹑手蹑脚刺探情报
The mess that makes you sneak around the castle when everyone's asleep.

557
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:49,430
条子的事呢？
The cop?

558
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:56,340
你看这个，这叫镇静喷血弹
See this? It's called a blood-splatter dart.

559
01:01:56,510 --> 01:02:00,810
撞击很真实，但却无害，主要是红色颜料
The impact's real, but it's harmless. Red paint, mostly.

560
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,700
为什么？
Why?

561
01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:07,140
我是个情报员
I'm a secret agent.

562
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:16,820
你这不是在糗我吗？
Are you sure you don't want to embarrass me?

563
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,800
- 拜托  - 有这么好笑吗？
- Come on.  - What's so funny about that?

564
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,660
你看看你
I mean, look at you.

565
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,430
我隶属于美国国安局
I work for the NSA.

566
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:31,100
你真会搞笑
You're funny, you know that?

567
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,980
约娜，我是阿奇
Yelena, it's Kirill.

568
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:41,350
尤里发现凯吉是美国情报员
Yorgi found out that Cage is an American agent.

569
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:46,980
你知道我在说什么吗？你有危险，亲爱的
Do you understand what I'm telling you? You are in danger, my love.

570
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:50,360
对街的大楼，雕像后面
The building across the street. The statue.

571
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:54,930
带他出来，其他的由我来
Bring him outside. I will do the rest.

572
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:04,140
是谁？你的相好？
What was that, your boyfriend?

573
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,840
假设你说的是真的
Let's say you are who you say you are.

574
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:18,550
- 你能帮我做些什么？ - 你想要什么？
- What can you do for me?  - What do you want?

575
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:25,230
我要免诉权，美国给我庇护和公民身分
I want immunity from prosecution, asylum in the U.S. and citizenship.

576
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,960
住迈阿密，外加有钱男友一个？
How about a condo on South Beach and a rich boyfriend?

577
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:30,190
那些我自己来就行
Those I can get for myself.

578
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:34,770
- 你要我怎么做？ - 我要知道“无政府99”的详情
- What do you want?  - I need to know more about Anarchy 99.

579
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:37,440
你想知道详情？
You want to know about Anarchy 99?

580
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:41,650
你看到辣妹、俱乐部和派对了
You've seen the girls, the clubs, the parties.

581
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:45,550
但你看不到白天发生的事
What you don't see is what goes on during the day.

582
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:51,250
去年活动很频繁，人们进进出出的
There's been a lot of activity in the last year. People coming in and out.

583
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:55,290
- 俄罗斯科学家  - 他们在干嘛？
- Russian scientists.  - Well, what are they up to?

584
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,890
不知，他们在地下室，我不能去
They go in the basement and I'm not allowed in.

585
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,300
现在是你设法进去的好时机
Now's a good time for you to get invited.

586
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:08,900
尤里知道你是情报员，阿奇正在外面拿枪指着你
Yorgi knows you're an agent. Kirill is waiting with his rifle.

587
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:16,340
- 哪里…？ - 别看！
- Where...?  - Don't look!

588
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:19,420
这里有后门
There's a back door.

589
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:21,850
走后门，他们就知道你警告我
They'll know you warned me.

590
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:25,510
走前门，他就会射杀你
If you go out the front, he'll put a bullet in your eye.

591
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:38,760
- 你有带枪吗？ - 一直都有
- You still packing?  - Always.

592
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:40,900
准备用枪吧
Get ready to use it.

593
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:46,970
- 你有何计划？ - 他还爱着你，对吧？
- What's your plan?  - He's still in love with you.

594
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:52,520
- 除非有把握，他不会开枪  - 这就是你的计划？你还真行
- He'll wait for a clear shot.  - That's your plan? Thank you. Great.

595
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:17,900
拔枪
Draw!

596
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,420
他上路了
He's on the way.

597
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:51,630
纪本，我最喜爱的绑匪头头，下回派辆礼车来接我吧
Gibbons! My favorite kidnapper. Next time send a limo.

598
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:01,110
哇咧，你别闹了吧
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

599
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:05,440
你已打败我了，不用再折磨我
You already broke me. No need to get cruel and unusual.

600
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:11,050
机票？这可好玩了
A ticket? Now, that's funny.

601
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:13,820
- 我现在要去哪？ - 回家
- Where am I going to go now?  - Home.

602
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:15,620
回家？
Home?

603
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,230
你的身分已被揭穿，你没用了
Your cover's blown. You're not useful.

604
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,730
就这样？没我的事了？
That's it? I'm done?

605
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:23,530
没错，我们情报已足供进行下一步行动
No tricks. We have enough intel to move forward.

606
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:28,570
- 谁去行动？ - 扫荡小组，快又有效
- With what?  - Sweeper team: quick, clean, effective.

607
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:31,680
不用担心，事情很快就会解决
Don't worry about it. It'll all be over soon.

608
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:35,580
你派扫荡小组去杀光所有人？
You mean a sweeper team to come in and kill everybody?

609
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:38,510
他们并非全都是大坏蛋
Not all of them are as bad as you think.

610
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:42,710
你得杀警才能混进去，他们这还不算是坏人？
You had to shoot a cop. How "not as bad as I think" could they be?

611
01:07:42,890 --> 01:07:45,050
好吧，听着
Okay, look.

612
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:49,020
事情有点复杂，里面有个女人，约娜
We've got a complication. There's a girl. Yelena.

613
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,680
永远都是有个女人
There's always a girl.

614
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:54,890
她想逃出来，而我派她回去帮你搜集情报
She wants out and I sent her back in to get more intel for you.

615
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:59,130
没时间玩游戏，决定已经下了
There's no time to play favorites. The cards have been dealt.

616
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:01,970
什么叫决定已经下了？
What do you mean the cards have been dealt?

617
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:04,440
你根本不认识她
You don't even know her, man.

618
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:09,500
对了，你给我们的银行帐号
Oh, by the way, that bank number you gave us?

619
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:15,810
你朋友和约娜，转帐大笔的现金…
Your friends and Yelena have made some large cash transfers...

620
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:20,190
给一群俄罗斯科学家，他们专精于…
...to a group of Russian scientists known to specialize and traffic...

621
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:22,990
生化武器
...in biological weapons.

622
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,500
- 老大，她跟那没关系  - 回家吧
- She had nothing to do with it.  - Go home.

623
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:28,600
- 她…  - 这是命令
- She ain't...!  - That's an order.

624
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:49,940
情况如何？
How's it going?

625
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:51,420
人生真烂！
Life is shit!

626
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:53,450
是啊，但你又能如何？
Yeah, well what can you do?

627
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:50,200
过了这扇门，你就要效忠到底
Through this door, you are with us to the end.

628
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:53,710
- 你确定要这样？ - 我确定
- Are you sure that's what you want?  - I'm sure.

629
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:38,340
这是亚哈号，它就像是艘太阳能潜水艇
This is Ahab. Think of it as solar-powered submarine.

630
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:41,520
它能绕行全球，命中目标
It can circumnavigate the globe to reach its target.

631
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:46,620
它只需要在水面上搜集阳光，就能完成任务
It need only surface to gather sunshine and to do its business.

632
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:49,720
什么任务？
What is it? What's its business?

633
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:55,220
送礼物给乖小孩
Dropping off presents to all the good little boys and girls.

634
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:07,870
我们明天就可以完成
My team will be finished tomorrow.

635
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:09,440
你们呢？
How about you?

636
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:13,280
我们好了
We're finished now.

637
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,170
尼可莱！
Nikolai!

638
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,480
准备火箭
Bring the rockets.

639
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,150
[亚哈号]

640
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:28,590
给你设定
The detonator is for you.

641
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,810
毒气开始混合…
Yorgi! The binary agents are mixing...

642
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:23,070
会害死大家！
...it will kill us all!

643
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:35,780
看起来真像小白鼠
Looks like little white mouse.

644
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:41,130
拜拜，小白鼠
Bye-bye, little mouse.

645
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:00,280
天啊
My God.

646
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:05,940
他们的工作已经完成，现在他们成了累赘
They did their job and now they were liability.

647
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:10,620
我们不需要太多知情的人
We don't need anyone talking about our business.

648
01:17:15,990 --> 01:17:20,660
风扇会抽出毒气，让它通过水
The gas gets sucked through the extractor fans, passed into water...

649
01:17:20,830 --> 01:17:24,790
再转化为完全无毒的空气
...and broken down to become, once again, completely harmless.

650
01:17:28,570 --> 01:17:30,470
真安静
So quiet.

651
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:37,210
难怪它会被称为“寂静之夜”
I know now why they call it Silent Night.

652
01:17:45,890 --> 01:17:47,320
去吃点东西
Let's get some food.

653
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:24,560
快去查是怎么回事
Find out what's going on!

654
01:18:58,830 --> 01:19:00,020
搞什么？
What the hell was that?

655
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,230
这招管用
That works.

656
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:36,770
引爆
Fire in the hole.

657
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:09,070
你怎么会在这里？
Sova. What are you doing here, man?

658
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:12,700
你先是在酒吧里陷害我，接着又开枪杀我
First you set me up in the bar. Then you shoot me in the back.

659
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:16,570
我老板这么对我，我再这么对你，这是恶性循环
My boss does it to me. I did it to you. It's a vicious circle.

660
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:18,440
- 你觉得这很有趣？ - 不，我不觉得
- You think it's funny?  - No.

661
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:21,310
你不会是怀恨在心吧？
You didn't take it personally, did you?

662
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:25,180
我设法混进去，我们是站同一边的，记得吧？
I did what I had to do to get in. We're on the same side.

663
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:28,260
抱歉，我换边了
I'm sorry. I switched sides.

664
01:21:28,790 --> 01:21:33,230
你对我太过份了，我的政府给的也没尤里多
You pushed me too far. My government doesn't pay as well as Yorgi.

665
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,430
我的政府给的是尤里给的两倍…
My government pays twice as much...

666
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:39,360
你以为这样突然跳进来这行…
Think you could just walk into the spy business...

667
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:44,700
- 就能一切顺风如意？ - 那你要怎样？射杀我？
- ...and have all the angles figured out?  - What are you going to do, shoot me?

668
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,900
你希望我射哪里？头？
Where? In the head, to be quick?

669
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:50,450
还是胸，好让我看看你的心脏
Or in the chest for an open casket, so I can see your heart?

670
01:21:50,650 --> 01:21:52,640
我想一下
Can I think about it?

671
01:22:00,690 --> 01:22:02,020
你这是干嘛？
What are you doing?!

672
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:06,100
我听到你讲话，知道你在哪里
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.

673
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:10,260
你怎么会跟伊凡在一起？
What are you doing with the lvans?

674
01:22:14,210 --> 01:22:15,330
怎么回事？
What's going on?

675
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:19,000
我有些话之前没对你说
There's something I didn't have the time to tell you.

676
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:21,240
我也是个情报员
I'm an agent as well.

677
01:22:21,410 --> 01:22:24,850
我是俄罗斯情报局的探员
I'm an agent for FSB, Russian Intelligence.

678
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:27,080
很像你们的中情局
You know, like your CIA.

679
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:30,240
- 我卧底两年了  - 两年？
- I've been undercover for two years.  - Two years?

680
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:33,150
你的计划是什么？等他们老死吗？
What was your plan, let them die of old age?

681
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:34,720
我们根本没有计划
There was no plan.

682
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:39,490
一年半以前，局里改组，我不再收到指令
A year ago, Intelligence gets reorganized, I stop getting orders.

683
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:44,490
他们把我给忘了，我只能尽力求生，你懂吗？
They forget about me. And I did what I must to survive. You understand?

684
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:47,970
我懂个屁，我才入行一周而已
What do I understand? I've been an agent for a week.

685
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:51,110
但我老板得知道一切详情
But my boss needs to know what we know now.

686
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:54,070
- 好吗？ - 好
- Okay?  - Okay.

687
01:22:55,150 --> 01:22:59,280
潜艇会施放神经毒气“寂静之夜”
The submarine's purpose is to deploy a nerve agent called Silent Night.

688
01:22:59,450 --> 01:23:02,680
它的配方在苏联解体后就失踪
It's been missing since the Soviet Union's collapse in '91 .

689
01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:04,190
它能屠杀百万人口
It can kill millions.

690
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:07,450
我们早知他们有鬼，你查到了
We knew they were up to something. You found out.

691
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:11,820
- 干的好，XXX  - 原来根本没什么扫荡小组
- That's excellent work, Triple X.  - There was never a sweeper team.

692
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:16,330
我若叫你别去跳帝国大厦…
If I said don't jump off the Empire State Building....

693
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:19,900
- 没错，我铁定会去跳  - 我激励了你
- You're right. I'd definitely do it.  - I inspired you.

694
01:23:20,070 --> 01:23:23,560
看吧，我是掌权者，我理当这么做
I'm an authority figure, that's what I'm supposed to do.

695
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:25,770
听着，我的人已经接手
Look, my men are on this now.

696
01:23:25,940 --> 01:23:29,350
- 你该回家了  - 那约娜呢？
- It's time for you to come home.  - What about Yelena?

697
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:35,780
我无权给她庇护
I'm not authorized to give her asylum.

698
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:40,450
但我保证你回来时一定搞定
But I promise it'll be done by the time you get here.

699
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:44,920
回来吧，桑德，这是命令
Come home, Xander. That's an order.

700
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:04,610
尤里多快就能发射这玩意？
How soon can Yorgi launch this thing?

701
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:11,650
他们叫你回去，你们的人接手…
You were told to go home! Your people are handling...

702
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:13,760
多快？
How soon, Yelena?

703
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:18,890
很快，但这不关我们的事了
Soon. But it's not our problem anymore!

704
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:22,000
他们若提前行动，就事关重大
If they get ahead of schedule, it's everyone's.

705
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:26,500
不可能的，他有军队、碉堡，你根本没有机会
He's got an army, a fortress. You don't stand a chance!

706
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:31,470
我曾为很多蠢事冒险，这是第一件对我有意义的事
I've risked my life for stupid reasons. This is the first one that makes sense.

707
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:36,170
这不是特技表演，你会送命的
This is not one of your stunts. You'll die in this, you know that.

708
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:41,020
我知道你若没回去…
If you don't go back in there...

709
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:45,310
他就会知道出事了
...he'll know something's wrong.

710
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:49,220
你不能要我回去，不行
You can't ask me to go back there. You can't.

711
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:56,970
知道最讽刺的是什么吗？我是自愿争取这任务的
You want to know something ironic? I volunteered for this assignment.

712
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:01,100
我想有所贡献
I wanted to make a difference.

713
01:25:02,210 --> 01:25:03,870
我努力争取这任务
I fought for it.

714
01:25:07,650 --> 01:25:08,940
那就完成它
Then finish it.

715
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:29,900
记得你吻我之后，我说了什么？
Remember what I told you, after you kissed me?

716
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:32,900
- 没有下次？ - 我说谎
- Never again?  - I lied.

717
01:25:51,390 --> 01:25:54,620
你仔细分析，其实我很单纯
But when you break it down, I'm a simple man.

718
01:25:54,790 --> 01:25:56,950
我很高兴能跟捷克美女…
I'd be happy with a beautiful Czech girl...

719
01:25:57,160 --> 01:26:01,120
怪胎！纪本下了新指令，上车
Hey, geek! Got new orders from Gibbons. Get in.

720
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:09,470
- 我要那些全装进这车里  - 没问题
- I want all that in here.  - Done.

721
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:13,040
城堡到处装满监视器
The castle's covered with surveillance cameras.

722
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:16,740
所以我们才无法靠近
That's why we cannot get close enough.

723
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:24,580
等等，所以我要去摧毁山脚下的…
Hang on. That's why I need to knock out the communications tower...

724
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:26,820
联络塔
...at the base of the mountain.

725
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:35,630
这里有人会开飞机吗？
Is there anyone here who knows how to fly a plane?

726
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,230
我会
I can.

727
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:48,140
这些山峰附近乱流太多
Too much turbulence around these mountains!

728
01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:50,970
把我送到那个塔上方就好
Just get me in line with that tower!

729
01:26:51,150 --> 01:26:52,710
剩下的交给我
I'll do the rest!

730
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:07,490
跳吧
Go now!

731
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:30,910
维多，有访客来了！
Viktor! We got company!

732
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:38,720
活逮他，再好好折磨他！
Catch him fast. Kill him slow!

733
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:31,050
新鲜的雪花真棒
Nothing like fresh powder.

734
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:12,120
老相好，你是不是头昏了？
Yelena, my sweet dove, did you get confused?

735
01:33:12,530 --> 01:33:17,260
你的任务是那条子杀了桑德后，再杀了他
Your assignment was to kill the cop after he killed X.

736
01:33:18,270 --> 01:33:22,710
这样不是个好俄罗斯卧底密探
Not good for undercover agent from Russian Intelligence.

737
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:30,310
我一直都知道你的底细…
I knew about you all along...

738
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:35,610
能随意摆布并利用你，真是好玩
...and it was my pleasure to twist you and use you how I saw fit.

739
01:33:37,450 --> 01:33:38,680
还有你
And you.

740
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:46,490
在众人之中，我以为你会懂…
Of all people, I thought you'd understand...

741
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:49,060
我想达成的梦想
...what I'm trying to accomplish.

742
01:33:49,570 --> 01:33:51,500
你想像一下？
Can you imagine?

743
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:55,300
想像布拉格在毒气云团下…
Imagine a city like Prague vanishing...

744
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:58,480
被消灭殆尽
...in a cloud of poison gas.

745
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:01,980
还有汉堡、伦敦、华盛顿
Then Hamburg, London, Washington.

746
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:07,780
凶手不明，原因也不明，所以大家兵戎相见
Imagine not knowing who did it, or why. And so they turn on each other.

747
01:34:08,190 --> 01:34:12,120
这些人攻击那些人，那些人侵略这些人
These guys attack those guys. Those guys invade these guys.

748
01:34:12,290 --> 01:34:15,260
很快地，全世界闹内讧
Soon, whole world implodes.

749
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:18,620
政府全都消失
Imagine governments disappearing.

750
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,590
最后…
And in the end...

751
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:25,290
达成一个绝对完美的自由状态
...imagine facing absolute, beautiful freedom.

752
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:33,040
但你们都无缘亲眼目睹了
But neither of you will be there to see it.

753
01:34:35,180 --> 01:34:37,200
跟维多一样
Like Viktor.

754
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:41,780
还有柯亚
Like Kolya.

755
01:35:28,430 --> 01:35:30,060
掩护我
Cover me!

756
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:41,670
帮我解开
Get me out of this thing!

757
01:35:45,850 --> 01:35:49,110
他拿走硬碟，他要发射亚哈号
He took the hard drive. He's going to launch Ahab!

758
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:56,960
自己选
Pick one.

759
01:36:07,670 --> 01:36:09,260
伊凡，轰了那些狙击手！
Ivan, take out that nest!

760
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:32,090
你要扳开保险才行
You have to turn the safety off.

761
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:58,280
尽量拖住他们
Hold them off as long as you can.

762
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:01,960
再见了，朋友
See you, my friend.

763
01:37:58,620 --> 01:38:00,280
快啊
Come on, baby.

764
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:11,930
停！他困住我们了
Stop! He's got us pinned down.

765
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,270
该死
Shit.

766
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,190
你有火箭筒啊
You got a bazooka!

767
01:38:19,370 --> 01:38:23,600
别把自己当警察，当电玩高手，随便开轰啊
Stop thinking Prague police and start thinking PlayStation. Blow shit up!

768
01:38:23,810 --> 01:38:27,300
这不是火箭筒，这是热感火箭
This is not bazooka. This is heat-seeker rocket.

769
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:31,250
感热？
Heat-seeker?

770
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:33,740
架好它
Set it.

771
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:40,750
那痞子在抽烟
The son of a bitch is smoking.

772
01:38:57,540 --> 01:39:00,410
我说过他会被烟害死，走吧
I told him that cigarette would kill him.

773
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:03,700
学学怎么开枪吧，笨蛋
Learn how to shoot, piece of shit!

774
01:40:29,230 --> 01:40:31,670
快，帮我把他拉出来
Quick! Help me pull him out!

775
01:40:36,210 --> 01:40:38,440
那玩意半小时内会抵达市内
It will hit the city in 30 minutes!

776
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:55,550
各位，我需要直升机
Guys. I need a helicopter.

777
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:58,620
我需要交通工具，我需要…
I need transportation. I need a...

778
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:09,330
你在这，我在找你，一切搞定
X, there you are. I gave you everything you wanted.

779
01:41:09,510 --> 01:41:11,670
这玩意只差不会飞了
This thing will damn near fly now.

780
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:14,740
你耍我，纪本根本没下令
You screwed me. Gibbons didn't authorize this.

781
01:41:14,910 --> 01:41:16,740
他会整死我们，我会完蛋
He'll hang us both out to dry.

782
01:41:16,910 --> 01:41:18,780
- 托比探员  - 什么事？
- Agent Shavers.  - Yeah?

783
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:21,850
我要升你的职
I'm going to give you a field promotion.

784
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:25,510
接手这个现场，由你全权负责
Take over, finish the mop-up. You're in charge.

785
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:30,060
遵命，我保证达成任务，我决不会令你失望
Yes, sir! I'm the man for the job! I won't let you down!

786
01:41:31,230 --> 01:41:32,920
等等、等等
Wait! Wait! Wait!

787
01:41:33,530 --> 01:41:35,230
操作手册，你会需要的
Almost forgot the manual. You'll need this.

788
01:41:35,430 --> 01:41:38,130
老大，去拯救世界吧
Hey, X. Go kick some ass.

789
01:41:59,060 --> 01:42:03,150
那玩意时速肯定有八十哩，我们要怎么停下它？
That thing must be going 80 mph! How do we stop it?!

790
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:07,390
没办法，控制中心在上面的透明圆顶里
We can't! The controls are on the bubble panel.

791
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:09,260
- 看到了？ - 看到了
- You see it?  - Yeah.

792
01:42:09,430 --> 01:42:11,660
硬碟就在里面
The hard drive's in there!

793
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:16,200
你有操作手册，查一查有什么可用的机关
You got the manual. See if Shavers put in anything we could use.

794
01:42:16,370 --> 01:42:19,370
- 他的字迹很潦草  - 快点
- He's got very bad handwriting.  - Come on!

795
01:42:19,710 --> 01:42:24,980
火焰喷射器、迷你炸弹、车轮盖炸弹、火箭发射器
Flame throwers, mini-bombs, exploding hubcaps, rocket launchers!

796
01:42:25,580 --> 01:42:29,210
这是辆坦克，你不能拿它对付亚哈号
This is a tank. You can't use any of it on Ahab.

797
01:42:29,390 --> 01:42:32,980
寂静之夜要在深水中引爆才行
Silent Night only breaks down in deep water.

798
01:42:33,890 --> 01:42:36,020
- 我要上去  - 什么？
- I'll have to get on it!  - What?

799
01:42:37,490 --> 01:42:39,290
我要上去
I'll have to get on it.

800
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:51,070
亚哈号再二十二分就到达布拉格了
Our surveillance puts Ahab 22 minutes outside of Prague.

801
01:42:51,270 --> 01:42:55,970
- 我们该疏散整个城市  - 二十二分钟疏散一百五十万人？
- We should evacuate the city.  - 22 minutes for 1.5 million people?

802
01:42:56,310 --> 01:42:59,940
找空军支援，我们可能得在水面上炸了它
Call air support. We may need to blow it out of the water.

803
01:43:00,380 --> 01:43:03,180
- 要是我们击中它…  - 那整个城市就完了
- lf we hit that thing...  - This city will die.

804
01:43:03,350 --> 01:43:05,480
危机必须受到控制
And the crisis will be contained!

805
01:43:05,660 --> 01:43:07,420
牺牲一个城市总胜过十个
One city's better than 10.

806
01:43:09,990 --> 01:43:13,550
还有一件事，有辆跑车跟亚哈号并行前进
Another thing: A blue GTO is traveling parallel to Ahab.

807
01:43:25,110 --> 01:43:27,910
该死，这条路会回到河边吗？
Shit! Does this road go back to the river?

808
01:43:28,310 --> 01:43:30,680
快点，查导航地图啊
Come on! Check the GPS!

809
01:43:32,420 --> 01:43:35,870
会！在十五哩后的狄维镇！
Yes, it does! Fifteen miles at the town of Davle!

810
01:43:53,470 --> 01:43:56,460
这里一定有我们能用的东西
There's got to be something here we could use.

811
01:43:56,640 --> 01:44:00,670
鱼叉炮、降落伞座椅、可弹射车顶
Harpoon gun, parachutes built into seats, ejectable roof.

812
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:03,010
全都没用
It's all useless!

813
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:05,780
还有多远？
How far are we?

814
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:10,540
那河就在下个村落后面
The river is just beyond the next village.

815
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:22,760
我要直接冲过去，发射火箭
I'm going through! Use the rocket launcher!

816
01:44:22,930 --> 01:44:24,630
- 二十二号！ - 快按
- Twenty-two!  - Hit it!

817
01:44:28,210 --> 01:44:30,700
那是火焰发射器，用火箭
That was a flamethrower! Use the rockets!

818
01:44:30,870 --> 01:44:34,070
是三十二号，我说过了，我说过他字迹很潦草
It's 32! I told you! I told you he had bad handwriting!

819
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:35,400
快按
Hit it!

820
01:45:09,810 --> 01:45:13,680
托比全都装上来了，查手册，我们一定漏了什么
Shavers loaded this thing. We're missing something.

821
01:45:13,980 --> 01:45:16,850
后面有更多武器，你看
There are more weapons here on the back. Look.

822
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:31,530
- 你来开车！ - 什么？你疯了
- Take the wheel!  - What? You're crazy!

823
01:45:36,210 --> 01:45:37,570
刹车！刹车！
The brake! The brake!

824
01:45:40,510 --> 01:45:41,770
加油！加油！
The gas! The gas!

825
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:56,430
你在干嘛？
X, what are you doing?

826
01:45:57,290 --> 01:45:59,160
五分钟后抵达目标上空
Five minutes to target.

827
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:06,690
说话啊，你在干嘛？
X, talk to me! What are you doing?

828
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:10,030
- 你说过有个可弹射车顶  - 对，就是那里
- You said there was an ejectable roof.  - Right here!

829
01:46:10,210 --> 01:46:11,260
按下去！
Hit it!

830
01:46:25,390 --> 01:46:27,950
该死，太远了
Shit! It's out of range!

831
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:31,560
- 那里有座桥，过桥去！ - 好
- There's a bridge! Cross the bridge!  - Okay.

832
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:47,370
加油
Come on.

833
01:46:50,950 --> 01:46:52,040
加油
Come on!

834
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:56,780
- 中了！ - 好耶！
- Got you!  - Yes!

835
01:46:58,490 --> 01:47:01,480
- 我真希望有带摄影机！ - 你说什么？
- I wish I had a camera!  - What you talking about?

836
01:47:01,660 --> 01:47:04,150
因为这次的特技肯定炫毙了
This is gonna be one hell of a trick.

837
01:47:59,620 --> 01:48:01,280
三分钟后抵达
Three minutes to target.

838
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:54,790
一分钟后抵达
One minute to target.

839
01:49:55,370 --> 01:49:57,490
快、快
Move! Move! Move!

840
01:49:58,470 --> 01:49:59,940
快让开、让开
Out of the way!

841
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:20,220
望远镜
Eyes!

842
01:50:37,140 --> 01:50:38,900
十秒后抵达
Ten seconds to target.

843
01:50:47,950 --> 01:50:49,440
目标在望
Target in sight.

844
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:53,650
取消空中行动，叫战机撤退
Call the jets off. Tell the jets to stand down!

845
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:08,970
欢迎进入桑德特区
Welcome to the Xander zone!

846
01:51:49,310 --> 01:51:54,650
零污染，我明白，长官，零污染
Zero contamination level. I understand, sir. Zero contamination level.

847
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:07,320
你就是约娜？
You Yelena?

848
01:52:08,730 --> 01:52:10,430
纪本先生
Mr. Gibbons.

849
01:52:11,230 --> 01:52:14,000
我答应桑德要让你去美国
I promised Xander you could go to America.

850
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:16,400
我言出必行
I'm a man of my word.

851
01:52:16,570 --> 01:52:19,510
现在这也没什么意义了
It doesn't make much difference now, does it?

852
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:48,630
他还活着，快过来
He's alive! He's alive! Come here!

853
01:52:55,780 --> 01:52:59,840
快把他弄回来，快，快去
Get him out of there, double-time. Go! Move!

854
01:53:02,050 --> 01:53:05,040
- 布拉布拉！ - 什么？我听不见！
- Bora Bora!  - What? I can't hear you!

855
01:53:08,490 --> 01:53:10,080
布拉布拉
Bora Bora.

856
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:37,110
你晒伤了
You're getting burnt.

857
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:44,620
桑德，你在吗？
Xander, you there?

858
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:49,100
我知道你在，我能透过卫星看到你
I know you're there, Xander. I've got you here on satellite magnification.

859
01:53:53,500 --> 01:53:56,940
回电给我，我有要事相谈
Call me. We got a whole new thing to talk about.

860
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:00,340
出大事来着
Something very important has come up.

861
01:54:01,310 --> 01:54:02,870
对了…
Oh, by the way...

862
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:06,340
你已通过了纪氏测验
...you passed the test. The Gibbons test.

863
01:54:09,350 --> 01:54:11,480
你别闹了
You gotta be kidding me.
