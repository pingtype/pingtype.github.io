15
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,890

就是一群醉汉在胡闹咯

107
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,290
这样他就会怒杀所有求婚者
so that he'll get angry enough to kill them.

108
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,320
那女神为什么要这么做？
And why does the goddess want that?

109
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,860
她希望奥德修斯发掘自己的力量
She wants Odysseus to find his strength...

110
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,560
和勇气？

116

你突然受到古巴音乐的鼓动吗
You felt the sudden urge for Cuban music?

133

138
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,140
你早晚能自己找到路的
You'll find your way sooner or later.

139
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,900
说不定一周或一个月就找到了
Maybe in a week or a month.

140
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,970
我去道个别
Let me just say good-bye.

141
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,210
爷爷！
Abuelito!

142
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,210
真棒
Bueno.

143
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,030
你叫他什么？
What was it you called him?

144
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,520
Abuelito 就是我爷爷
Abuelito. It's my grandpa.

145
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,990
我是凯蒂 你的名字是？
I'm Katey. What's your name?

146
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,930
哈维尔
Javier.

147
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,060
这么说 你认识五个西语单词了吗
So what, you know like five words in Spanish?

148
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,270
可能有十个呢
Maybe ten.

149
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,500
你为什么那么努力学习
And what are you studying so hard to do?

150
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,570
我也不知道
I haven't figured it out yet.

151
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,140
来 我帮你拿
Here. Let me take that.

152
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,840
我从没见过那样的舞蹈
I've never seen dancing like that.

153
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,320
什么样的舞蹈？
Like what?

154
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,260
我说不清
I don't know.

155
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,990
我很喜欢 它非常地
I like it. It's very...

156
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,630
- 非常古巴？ - 没错
- Very Cuban?  - Yeah.

157
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,300
- 我们应该离开这里  - 为什么
- We should get off the street.  - Why?

158
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,260
你不明白他们在唱什么
You don't understand what they're singing.

159
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,440
不！
No!

160
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,670
不！
No!

161
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,940
往那边跑！
That way!

162
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,310
所以你得… 没事 她回来了
So you've got... OK. Here she comes.

163
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,220
非常感谢您
Thank you so much.

164
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,350
感谢上帝 凯蒂 你去哪儿了
Thank God. Katey, where have you been?

165
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,520
我错过了校车
I missed the bus.

166
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,030
我没事 走回来的
I'm fine. I walked.

167
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,890
天啊 凯蒂 为什么不给我打电话
For heaven's sakes.Katey, why didn't you call me?

168
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,920
我担心你被叛乱分子绑架了
For all I knew, you could have been kidnapped by rebels.

169
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,870
你该担心的不是叛乱分子
It's not the rebels you should be worried about.

170
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,130
你说什么？
What did you say?

171
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,070
你说得对 我错了 我应该打给你的
You're right. I'm sorry. I should have called.

172
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,410
亲爱的 你的书包呢
Honey, where's your book bag?

173
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,250
我把它留在学校了
I left it at school.

174
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,410
太重了
It was heavy.

175
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,770
哦 天啊
Oh, God.

176
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:42,040
多亏这些无聊的美国书
It was good I had all these boring American books with me.

177
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,770
他们才认为我不是革命者
They realized I couldn't be a revolutionary.

178
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,180
我不明白
I don't understand.

179
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,510
他们只是在唱歌
They were just singing.

180
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,480
这里已经没有 只是唱歌 这样的事了
There is not such a thing as "just singing" here anymore.

181
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,350
你跳得很棒
You know,you're a pretty good dancer.

182
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,450
我跳得很差劲
I was terrible.

183
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,290
是啊 你跳得差劲
Oh, yeah. Yeah, you were terrible...

184
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,760
不过对一个美国人来说
but for an American

185
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,800
你的动作很不错了
you move well.

186
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,460
哦 谢谢
Oh, thanks.

187
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,600
你为什么要照着镜子跳呢
Why do you look in the mirror?

188
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,240
我在回想看过的步法
I was trying to remember the steps I saw.

189
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,410
可看镜子没有什么用吧
But what does looking have to do with it?

190
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,880
你只需感受音乐
Just feel the music.

191
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,850
想学舞蹈 就来看看吧
You should see for yourself.

192
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:30,320
周六晚上真正的舞者会去黑玫瑰酒吧
The real dancers are at La Rosa Negra on Saturday night.

193
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,650
我去不了
I can't.

194
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,720
有人邀请我去乡村俱乐部了
I got invited to this country club thing.

195
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,700
- 嘿 进展很快啊  - 是啊
- Hey, that was fast.  - Yeah.

196
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,100
这就是你为什么想要学古巴舞蹈吗
Is that why you want to learn Cuban dancing?

197
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,540
为了给你的男伴留下好印象？
Just to impress your date?

198
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,510
不 我想
No. I wanted to...

199
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,510
没事 别担心
Don't worry. Don't worry.

200
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,240
他们在俱乐部里可不会那样跳
They won't dance like that at the club.

201
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,800
学会狐步就够了
Just learn the fox trot instead.

202
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,780
我早就会狐步舞了
I already know the fox trot.

203
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,430
我们需要去逛街吗
Do we need to go shopping?

204
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,090
我只是在想 周六晚上你可能
I just thought you might be going to the country club...

205
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,230
要去乡村俱乐部
Saturday night.

206
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,800
你怎么知道？
Oh, you just thought?

207
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,900
菲尔普斯太太请我吃午饭
Mrs. Phelps took me to lunch.

208
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,430
你们不是在商量包办婚姻吧
You two aren't planning an arranged marriage, are you?

209
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,880
我怎么没想到呢
No. I should have thought of that.

210
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,880
詹姆斯很帅耶
He's so cute.

211
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,700
- 尤兰达？ - 什么事？
- Yolanda?  - Yes?

212
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,860
这裙子是不是很方？
Is this square?

213
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,300
很方？
Square?

214
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,960
嗯 你看…像方形吗
Yeah, you know...Iike a square?

215
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,970
方形好不好看呢
Is a square good or bad?

216
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,130
不好看
It's bad.

217
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,510
这样的话
Si.

218
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,600
那就是方形的
This is square.

219
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,510
噢 天啊
Oh, God.

220
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,850
我觉得不行吧
I don't know.

221
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,120
你个头比我小 你的衣服可能…
You're smaller than me.Your dresses'll be...

222
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,320
就它了
Perfect.

223
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,480
你在开玩笑吧
You're joking.

224
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,150
怎么了 这件也很方吗
Why? Is it square?

225
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,660
当然不是
Definitely not.

226
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,790
太不公平了！
It's not fair!

227
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,300
我所有的朋友都能去
All of my friends are going...

228
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,000
为什么你能去而我不能？
so why would you go and I can't?

229
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,200
我比你大
I am older than you.

230
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,610
真浪费 你根本不懂享乐
Such a waste. You don't even know how to have fun.

231
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,630
真不想我留下来陪你？
Sure you don't want me to stay?

232
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,360
爸 别跳了
Dad, don't.

233
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,400
好吧 拜拜
OK. Bye.

00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:02,370
不在 他在酒店上班
No. He's working there now.

423
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,910
你没看见他？
You don't see him?

424
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,400
她想找
Esta buscando...

425
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,300
没事妈妈 我认识她 待会见

过来 我们进去
Venga. Vamos.

428
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:20,030
你找我弟弟什么事？
So, what do you want with my brother?

429
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,800
我想和他谈谈
I need to talk to him.

430
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,270
你让他丢了工作 还不够？
You got him fired. Isn't that enough?

431
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,530
我有让他赚钱的办法
I know a way he can make some money.

432
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,380
你们这些美国佬 跑这儿来
You Yankees, you come here...

433
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,280
把钱扔进赌场
and you pour money into the casinos...

434
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,750
塞进那帮恶棍的口袋
into the pockets of the gangsters...

435
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,800
他们统治着国家
who run this country,

436
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,420
杀害无辜的人民
the same gangsters who murder innocent people.

437
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,220
杀害了我父亲
Iike my father.

438
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,980
我不知道这些事
I didn't know.

439
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:47,420
是啊 你不知道
That's right. You don't know.

440
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,500
哈维
Javi.

441
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,800
她来这儿干什么？
¿Qué esta haciendo aquí?

442
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,240
抱歉你丢了工作
I feel terrible about what happened.

443
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,410
我去了你家
I went to your house...

444
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,710
我家？你跟我妈说我被炒了？
My house? You told my mother I was fired?

445
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,720
- 不 我没有  - 那你想干嘛
- No, I didn't  - Then what do you want?

446
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,880
我只想跟你谈谈
I told her I wanted to talk to you.

447
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,440
我很抱歉
I'm sorry you got fired.

448
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:20,320
没事 是我的错 我该注意点的
Don't worry. It's my fault. I knew better.

449
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,160
这是你的新工作吗
Is this your new job?

450
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,760
可不是 你们造汽车 我们偷
That's right.You make 'em. We steal 'em.

451
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,890
是吧 哈维？
Isn't that right, Javi?

452
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:37,100
我知道有个舞蹈比赛
There's this dance contest...

453
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,410
平安夜在豪华俱乐部举行
at the Palace...Christmas Eve.

454
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,970
我觉得你应该去
I think you should go.

455
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,250
去看看他们需不需要杂工吗
And see if they need any busboys?

456
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,840
我不是这个意思
That's not what I mean.

457
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:49,980
你知道什么人能进豪华俱乐部吧

459
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,030
但你要做我的舞伴
You'd have to be my partner.

460
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,130
你是说 跟你一起跳舞？
You mean, dance with you?

461
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:03,140
天啊 我没那么差劲吧
God, I'm not that bad.

462
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,200
你昨晚又不介意
You didn't seem to mind it last night.

463
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,140
我昨晚没想着赢比赛
I wasn't trying to win a contest.

464
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,300
哦 你不想吗
Oh, weren't you?

465
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:17,150
对不起 我有很多事要做
I'm sorry, but I have a lot of work to do.

469
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,990
我没时间
I don't have time.

470
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,400
[请停止杀害我们的子民！]

471
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,000
到这儿来一下
Cae y va un poca.

472
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,670
你还有小孩要照顾呢
Tiene un hermanito por aquí.

473
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,170
我还要去送货
Tiene que hacer la entrega

474
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,930
送货？随你怎么说
Entrega...Dice lo que quería.

475
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,720
是啊 我还得运药 你要看吗？
Sí, con cargamento de medicina. ¿Qué, te velo?

476
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,420
不了
No.

477
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,420
我很高兴你胸怀大志 卡洛斯
Me alegro de que tenga un corazón tan grande,Carlos.

478
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,800
希望你也能帮家里的忙
A lo mejor un día que da la ayuda por la familia.

479
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,580
你会明白我一直在帮忙的
Algun día trata cierto esoy ayudando

480
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,860
嗨
Hi.

481
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,600
那个舞蹈比赛
This contest...

482
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,130
要花钱吗
does it cost money?

483
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,740
不用
No.

484
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,250
你知道那是交际舞比赛吧
You know that it's ballroom dancing.

485
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,480
不是我跳的那种
It's not what I do.

486
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,570
是拉丁交际舞
It's Latin ballroom.

487
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,680
如果把你的舞和我的糅合在一起
If we mix what you do with what I do...

488
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,210
我们一定能擦出火花
I really think we'd have something.

489
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,450
那我还得从头开始教你
I still have to teach you everything.

490
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:06,480
也不是从头吧
Not everything.

491
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:09,430
我也得教你一些舞步呢
I'll have to teach you a few things, too.

492
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,220
我们能行吗
Can we do this?

493
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,440
- 怎么了  - 你在干什么
- What?  - What are you doing?

494
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,280
跳舞啊
Just dancing.

495
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,910
但这是有规则的
But this is a routine.

496
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:33,440
你不能只跟着感觉跳
You can't just do what you feel like...

497
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:34,450
想到什么就跳什么
when you feel like it.

498
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:35,920
我跳舞的时候可没有规则
When I dance, I have no routine.

499
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,360
但这是舞蹈比赛啊 我们需要编舞
But this is a contest. We need a structure.

500
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,260
我能看看吗
Can I see that?

501
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:48,000
首先 你要学会动作
First, you learn to move,

502
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,000
- 再去考虑要求和规则  - 好吧
- and then we worry about lists and words.  - OK. Fine.

503
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,960
你怎么叫这个部位？
How do you call this?

504
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,630
臀部？
Your hips?

505
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,870
扭动臀部
Move your hips.

506
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,100
转圈
And circle.

507
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,170
继续
Come on.

508
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:03,340
继续 转个圆圈
Come on. And circle.

509
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,680
你那是方形的
That's a box.

510
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,780
什么 你疯了吗
What, are you crazy?

511
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,450
我为什么要掩护你？
Why should I cover for you?

512
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,620
你要我告诉他们那天晚上的事吗
You want me to tell them what happened?

513
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,650
嘿 你们俩
Well, hello there.

514
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,680
妈！
Mom!

515
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,700
我们要去喝柠檬水
We're just heading over for some lemonade.

516
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:19,700
- 一起去吗  - 不 不用了
- Would you care to join us?  - No, no.

517
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,200
下次吧
We'll take a rain check.

518
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,070
好 玩得开心点
OK. You two have fun.

519
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,200
我会帮哈维尔 你也要帮我
I'm gonna help Javier, and you're gonna help me.

520
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,000
你的姿势真差
Your frame is really weak.

521
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,320
好点了吗
Better?

522
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:40,440
我跳舞可不会弄伤自己 谢谢
I could do without the bruises, thanks.

523
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,460
我们中间还能再插进一对舞伴
I can fit another couple between us.

524
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:47,320
到时舞厅不会很拥挤
It's not gonna be a crowded club.

525
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,160
我们要绕场一圈
We've gotta sweep across the dance floor.

526
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,660
行 行 跟你绕就是了
OK. OK, I can sweep.

527
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,260
你在干什么 你的步伐太大了
What are you doing? Your steps are too big.

528
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,070
不会啊 我在绕啊
No, I'm sweeping.

529
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,730
你和詹姆斯怎样了？
How's it going with James?

530
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,040
我要做功课
I got homework to do.

531
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:05,410
亲爱的 你知道吗
You know what, sweetie?

532
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,470
我一直想问问
I've been wanting to ask you

533
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:10,640
你和詹姆斯相处时
if you have any questions or...

534
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,240
有没有什么疑虑或担忧
concerns, you know, about you and James.

535
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:20,420
我好像在跟我妈的熨衣板跳舞
It's like dancing with my mother's ironing board.

536
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,850
闭上眼睛
Just close your eyes.

537
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,120
干嘛
Why?

538
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,260
闭上就对了
Just do it.

539
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,540
说出来有点奇怪
It's awkward to talk about, but...

540
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:41,980
但不能让男生强迫你 这很重要
it's important that you not let a boy pressure you.

541
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,610
有时你跟詹姆斯在一起
And even if you have certain feelings...

542
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:45,910
可能会有些感觉
when you're with James...

543
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:49,790
令你不太习惯
feelings that you aren't used to having...

544
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,420
哦 天啊
Oh, God!

545
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,830
男生怎么都这样？
Do you have to be such a guy?

546
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,670
好吧
OK.

547
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,870
我来做女生
OK, I'll be the girl.

548
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:16,780
你现在的决定和选择
The decisions you make now, the choices you make...

549
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,510
可能会影响你的一生
could affect your whole life.

550
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,350
你明白吗
Do you understand what I'm saying?

551
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,080
明白了？
You do?

552
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,700
我不想浪费这好音乐
I didn't want to waste the music.

553
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:18,370
嗯 当然
No, of course not.

554
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,710
怎么了？
What's the problem?

555
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,680
为什么那么害怕我碰你？
Why are you so afraid to let me lead you?

556
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,180
我没有
I'm not.

557
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:31,390
你有 等你能承认你害怕
You are. When you're ready to say you're afraid...

558
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:34,050
再告诉我
Iet me know.

559
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,190
- 嘿  - 不好意思
- Hey.  - Sorry.

560
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,830
不 不 别走 我快练完了
No, no, no. Stay. I'm almost done anyway.

561
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:49,600
怎么样 你决定了吗
So, what did you decide?

562
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,610
我决定参加比赛
I entered the contest.

563
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,670
这很好啊
All right. Good for you.

564
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,680
准备得怎样？
So, how's it going?

565
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,550
挺好的
Oh, great. It's going great.

566
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,920
真的吗
Really?

567
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,290
唉 其实不太好
No, it's not.

568
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:12,220
天啊 我是疯了才觉得我们能行
God, I must have been crazy to think we could do this.

569
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,490
两周后比赛就开始了
It's in two weeks...

570
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:18,490
每次他前进 我后退
and whenever he pushes, I pull...

571
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,440
我放松自己舞动起来
and I'm flowing, and I'm being free...

572
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,740
我转圈
and I'm making a circle...

573
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,240
也不再僵硬得像熨衣板
and I'm not an ironing board anymore...

574
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,250
可还是不行
and it's still not working.

575
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,910
现在他又说 你很害怕
And now he says, "You're afraid."

576
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:33,480
你害怕吗
Are you?

577
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,950
不怕
No.

578
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,210
那太糟糕了
That's too bad.

579
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,620
过来一下
Come here un momento.

580
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,150
站在这里
Stand right here.

581
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:50,930
让我看看你的姿势
Let me see your frame.

582
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:52,340
很好
Good.

583
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:56,670
手抬高一点
A little pressure.

584
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,340
你从哪学的舞蹈？
So, where'd you learn this?

585
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,680
我父母 他们都是舞者
My parents. They were dancers.

586
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,120
是嘛？
Really?

587
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,360
放松
Relax.

588
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:14,980
就这样
Yes.

589
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,590
把手放下
Drop your arms.

590
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,650
吸气
Breathe.

591
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,760
试试基本舞步
Now just basic.

592
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,870
很好
Good.

593
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:32,610
你刚刚为什么说 太糟糕了？
What did you mean when you said, "That's too bad"?

594
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,240
如果你不能克服心中的恐惧
If you can't move through your fear...

595
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,840
不能敞开心扉
and connect with yourself...

596
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,350
那绝对不可能
there's absolutely no way...

597
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,540
和舞伴心有灵犀
you're gonna connect with your partner.

598
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,450
听我说
Listen to me.

599
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:44,920
我知道让人触碰你的身体
I know that it's scary as hell...

600
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,890
会让你很害怕
to let another person touch that part of you.

601
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:50,490
但如果做得到 那就值得
But if you do, it's worth it.

602
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:53,900
现在忘掉我说的话 尽情跳舞吧
Now forget everything I just said and dance.

603
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,900
舞池是你的了
The floor is yours.

604
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,270
回见
I'll see you.

605
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,420
好吧 我承认
OK, I am.

606
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,820
承认什么？
You're what?

607
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:28,590
我害怕
Afraid.

608
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,960
动作要像水一样灵动
So the movement has to be fluid like the water.

609
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,500
非洲古巴舞 是奴隶的舞蹈
Afro-Cuban dance, it's the dance of slaves.

610
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:42,340
只有跳舞的时候 他们才能感到自由
When they danced, it was their only time to feel free.

611
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:47,280
所以他们可以像鸟儿一样
So they could be a bird, you know...

612
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,130
或者跳弗拉明戈舞步
or do a flamenco step

613
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:52,250
嘲笑他们的主人
and make fun of their owners.

614
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,440
又或者融入大海
Or just be in the sea...

615
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:56,350
忘记自己被困在远离家园的岛屿上
instead of being stuck on an island away from home.

616
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,810
翩然起舞时
It's a dance

617
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:02,120
你会成为理想的自己
about being exactly who you want to be in that moment.

618
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:12,320
你的动作一定要像
It has to feel and look

619
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,440
海浪般自然
as natural as the waves.

620
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:17,310
潮来
Coming...

621
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:20,370
潮往
and going.

622
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:22,140
潮来
Coming...

623
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:30,550
那时我们在吃晚餐 有人来敲门
We were having dinner, and there was a knock on the door.

624
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:33,680
两名警察把我父亲带走了
Suddenly two policemen were taking my father away.

625
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,690
谁都可能出卖了我父亲
The traitor could have been anyone.

626
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:39,690
到处都是巴蒂斯塔的特务
Batista has his spies everywhere.

627
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:41,260
你知道吗 这就是命
That's the thing, you know?

628
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,300
我父亲没有伤害过任何人
My father never hurt anybody.

629
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,460
他只是一个自由思想者
He was just a free thinker...

630
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,630
但有人不喜欢他的想法
but someone didn't like his thoughts.

631
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:53,670
我们举行了葬礼 但是没有找到尸体
We had a funeral but we never found his body.

632
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:56,100
卡洛斯害怕他会成为下一个受害者
Carlos disappeared for a while,

633
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,150
到外面躲了一阵
afraid he would be next...

634
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,240
一天有个女孩抱着孩子来我家
and then this girl shows up with a baby...

635
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,080
说是卡洛斯的 她养不了
says it's his and she cannot afford it...

636
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,750
突然间我肩负起了养活全家的重担
and suddenly I'm in charge of my whole family.

637
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:07,550
可能这不是你想要的生活
Maybe it's not what you want for yourself...

638
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:09,580
但是你却做得很好
but you are making a difference.

639
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:12,690
人们正在进行革命 而我在做什么
There's a revolution out there, and what am I doing?

640
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:15,500
只是给赃车涂新漆 回家带孩子
Just painting stolen cars and baby-sitting.

641
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:17,130
不 你维持了全家的生计
No, you're keeping your family alive.

642
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:19,730
这就是最重要的事
That's the most important thing you could do.

643
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,000
如果我们真的赢得比赛
If we could really win this contest...

644
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:32,040
说不定我能带家人搬到美国去
maybe I could bring my family to America with us.

645
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:42,190
你的父母 真是优秀的舞者
Your parents, they're perfect.

646
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,860
他们多么渴望将对方拥入怀中
You see how much they want to be in each other's arms?

647
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,840
我们一起跳舞 我是说真正的舞蹈
For us to dance together, I mean really dance...

648
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:54,900
就应该是这样
that's how it has to be.

649
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:22,790
哦 你们继续
Oh, don't let us interrupt you.

650
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:24,300
不 我们只是…
No, we were just...

651
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:25,160
嗯 我们看见了
Yeah, we saw.

652
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,860
听着 哈维尔 如果你想点干正事
Listen, we have more stuff in the alley...

653
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,700
巷子里面还有东西要搬
if you want to do something useful, Javier.

654
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,800
我该回家了
I should get home.

655
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:53,420
想起来回家了？
Thanks for stopping by.

656
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,190
离宵禁还有半个小时呢
It's half an hour before curfew.

657
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:57,790
你去哪了 参加马戏团了？
What'd you do, join the circus?

658
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,630
你想说你跟詹姆斯出去了？
You're gonna tell me you were out with James?

659
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:05,260
你是这么跟你妈说的
That's what you told your mother.

660
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:09,900
我可没把苏西的话告诉她
I never told her what Susie said.

661
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:11,100
苏西乱说的
Susie was wrong.

662
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,200
好吧
OK.

663
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,410
晚安 爸爸
Good night, Dad.

664
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,650
嗨
Hi.

665
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,090
你要多久才能消气？
How long you gonna be mad at me?

666
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:36,800
这里的女孩真是
The girls here.

667
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:38,460
我跟露易丝说我喜欢 简·爱
I told Lois that I like "Jane Eyre"...

668
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,490
她居然问我简·爱演了哪部电影
and she asked me what movie she was in.

669
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:46,810
对不起 我告了密
I'm really sorry that I told on you.

670
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:52,010
哈维尔不是那样的人 我错了
And what I said about Javier, I was wrong.

671
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,920
苏西 你要为自己想想
You gotta think for yourself, Suze.

672
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,480
我知道
I know.

673
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:03,550
我想你了
I miss you.

674
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:13,870
我好想跟你聊聊最近的事
Well, I've been dying to tell you.

675
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,900
这次你能保密吗
Can you keep a secret this time?

676
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,900
糟糕
Coño.

677
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,300
你要去哪？
¿Adónde tú vas?

678
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:48,650
今晚可是平安夜 别说你要去工作
Es Nochebuena. XXX dice que vas a ir a trabajar.

679
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:51,400
我要借你的西装穿
Necesito tu traje.

680
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,600
为什么？
¿Y eso?

681
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,100
我要去参加舞蹈比赛
Voy a una competencia de baile.

682
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,400
在哪儿？
¿Dónde?

683
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,300
豪华俱乐部
En el Palace

684
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:06,600
你想借西装去巴蒂斯塔最喜欢的地方？
¿Y tú quieres ponerte el traje para ir al lugar favorito de Batista?

685
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:10,500
不 我要去赢得除夕夜的五千美元大奖
No, lo quiero para ganarme 5000 canas que dan de premio en año nuevo.

686
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:14,600
当然了 你要去拍那些美国佬的马屁
Sí, claro, meneándole el culo a los americanos.

687
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,500
还有古巴佬的呢
Y a los cubanos, también.

688
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:27,560
苏西 我和你妈妈有个坏消息要告诉你
Susie, your mother and I have some very disappointing news.

689
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,860
我知道你有多想装饰圣诞树…
Now, I know how you love to decorate the Christmas tree...

690
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,830
唱圣诞歌和看家庭影片…
and sing carols and watch home movies...

691
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:33,860
但是恐怕今晚…
but I'm afraid tonight...

692
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,130
我们都要去豪华俱乐部
we're all gonna have to go to the Palace.

693
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,300
- 我们都去？ - 是的 苏西 全家人
- All of us?  - Yes, Susie, all of us.

694
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:42,040
我知道今晚是你和詹姆斯的约会之夜
I know it's your big night with James...

695
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,980
不过 能给老爸留支舞吗
but you think you could save your old man one dance?

696
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:46,680
什么时候决定的？
When did this happen?

697
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,050
你知道你爸这人的
Well, you know your father.

698
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:50,110
到处说我们会跳舞
Blabs to everyone we were dancers.

699
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:52,000
所以菲尔普斯家邀请我们去看
So the Phelpses invited us to

700
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:52,990
拉丁交际舞大赛
the Latin ballroom contest.

701
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,990
我听说那里的舞跳得很好
Where I hear the dancing is supposed to be pretty good...

702
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:57,790
但我和你妈妈会去那里挑刺儿
but your mother and I will be looking out for mistakes.

703
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,110
我真想看你父母惊讶的表情

01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:46,430
什么 发生什么事了？
What? What happened?

833
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:48,700
没什么 我没事
Nothing happened. I'm fine.

834
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:49,730
你为什么不告诉我们？
Why didn't you tell us?

835
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:51,870
因为我不想搞砸你的工作
Because I didn't want to mess up your job!

836
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:55,680
凯蒂 你怎么会这么想
Katey, how could you think...

837
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:57,980
我的工作能比你重要吗
that my job would be more important than you?

838
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:01,610
我没有想过要伤害你们
I didn't want to hurt you.

839
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:07,820
我只想帮哈维尔 这是他名字
I just wanted to help Javier,which is his name, by the way.

840
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:13,320
上帝啊 我真喜欢跟他跳舞
Oh, God, I love dancing with him.

841
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:16,030
哦 凯蒂
Oh, Katey.

842
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:22,370
你没想过他可能在利用你吗
Did it ever occur to you that boy might be using you?

843
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:23,260
一个单纯的美国女孩
A nice American girl

844
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:24,200
就能带他逃离哈瓦那？
who can be his ticket out of Havana?

845
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,210
不是这样的
That's not true.

846
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,230
你或许喜欢和他跳舞
You may love dancing with that boy...

847
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,400
但你有更重要的事情要考虑
but there are more important factors here...

848
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,670
比如你的家庭和未来
Iike your family and your future!

849
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:30,910
为什么只能二选一？
Why does it have to be either-or?

850
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:32,680
就因为你放弃了你热爱的舞蹈
Just because you gave up your passion,

851
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:33,420
我就也得放弃吗
why should l?

852
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:43,220
凯蒂
Katey.

853
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,430
凯蒂
Katey.

854
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:49,900
凯蒂 等下 宝贝 等一下
Katey, wait. Honey, wait!

855
01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:51,260
我要去找哈维尔
I'm going to Javier's.

856
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,130
你妈只是想保护你
Your mother's just trying to protect you.

857
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:54,540
无论你和妈妈怎么想
I'm gonna be out there on New Year's Eve...

858
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:56,770
我除夕要在他家过了
no matter what you and Mom think.

859
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:58,710
别再撒谎了
No more lies.

860
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:06,410
他在外面庆祝呢
He's out celebrating...

861
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:10,610
所以如果你要等他
so if you want to wait for him...

862
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:17,750
凯蒂打电话来了
That was Katey.

863
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,960
没事了 她跟哈维尔的妈妈一起
It's OK. She's with his mother.

864
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,330
是我错了吗
Was I wrong?

865
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,230
你没错
No...

866
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:29,140
不过凯蒂也没错
but neither was Katey.

867
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:32,060
有时我真希望我们…
Sometimes I wish we...

868
01:02:32,110 --> 01:02:36,140
如果我们没有…
I just try to imagine what it would be like...

869
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:38,480
现在的一切会是怎样呢
if we hadn't had...

870
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,580
我这么想是不是个坏母亲？
Does it make me a bad mother?

871
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:45,380
当然不是
Of course not.

872
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:51,890
你当时舞跳得真好 怀念一下也无妨
You were good.It's OK to miss it.

873
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:57,020
他们一定会打破我们平静的生活 不是吗
They sure spiced up our old routine, didn't they?

874
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:58,500
我也觉得
I'll say.

875
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:00,500
即使在罗斯兰德也未必比现在好 对吧
That wouldn't have gone over too well at Roseland, would it?

876
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:02,130
对
No.

877
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,070
伯特 她已经不是一个小女孩了
Bert, she's not a little girl anymore.

878
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:30,660
你在看什么呢
What are you reading?

879
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:36,500
[何塞·马蒂：古巴卓越的诗人，杰出的民族英雄和伟大的思想家]
何塞·马蒂的书
Jose Marti.

880
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:37,670
这是我爸的
It was my father's.

881
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:41,770
为安全起见 我们丢掉了他所有的书
We got rid of all his books just to be safe, but...

882
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:43,510
但我留下了这本
I kept this one.

883
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:46,080
嘿
Hello.

884
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:48,410
- 哈维尔？ - 怎么了？
- Javier?  - Yeah?

885
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:52,250
如果我们没能赢得决赛
lf we don't win the finals...

886
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:53,220
我们会赢的
We will.

887
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:55,720
但如果没有…
But if we don't...

888
01:03:57,590 --> 01:03:59,690
我半年后不去上大学了
I'm not gonna go to college in six months.

889
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,830
不知道半年后你会怎么想呢
You don't know how you're gonna feel in six months.

890
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:10,200
我知道
Yes, I do.

891
01:04:12,110 --> 01:04:13,440
你不知道
No, you don't.

892
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:17,540
我不想你为了我放弃梦想
I don't want you to give up your dreams for me.

893
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:19,280
但我有了新的梦想
But I have new dreams now.

894
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:06,290
苏西 我们去泳池边吃自助餐吧
Susie, why don't you and I go raid that buffet by the pool?

895
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:07,800
好
Sure.

896
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,980
这棵树真漂亮
Tree looks nice.

897
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:29,680
你爸爸和我讨论过了…
Your father and l discussed it...

898
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,790
我们认为你应该
and we think that you should do...

899
01:05:36,830 --> 01:05:39,300
决赛时做一组两圈平转动作
a double turn at the finals.

900
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,870
你喜欢我跳的舞？
You like the way I danced?

901
01:05:45,770 --> 01:05:48,570
凯蒂
Katey...

902
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:52,270
如果让我同意你俩在一起 我做不到
if you're asking me to approve of you and this boy, I can't.

903
01:05:52,310 --> 01:05:54,640
但你们的舞蹈…
But the dancing...

904
01:05:57,510 --> 01:05:59,640
真是太精彩了
The dancing was incredible.

905
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:04,650
我觉得我也有点功劳
I think I should take a little credit for that.

906
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,720
我也觉得
I think you should, too.

907
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:23,400
- 嗨  - 嗨

944
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:12,710
我跟他们不一样

01:11:12,710 --> 01:11:15,010
这些人杀了我们的父亲

见鬼去吧
¡vete para el carajo!

951
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:52,500
真奇怪…
Como lo extraño…

952
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:58,300
有时我真想进父亲的房间去…
A veces pienso que en cualquier momento va a entrar por la puerta

953
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,300
找他的书
Buscando sus libros.

954
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,450

听着
oye

958
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:27,500
你是个很糟糕的舞者
Eres tremendo bailarín…

959
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,900
你还是个很糟糕的服务员呢
Y tu tremendo camarero.

960
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:28,350
革命万岁！
¡Viva la revolucion!

961
01:13:30,330 --> 01:13:32,270
各位贵宾请注意
Attention, all hotel guests.

962
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:35,200
巴蒂斯塔总统已潜逃出境

963
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:39,470
这里暂时没有危险 请联系前台
There is no immediate danger.Please contact the front desk...

964
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,830
不敢相信真的发生了
I can't believe it's real.

965
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:11,310
你不想出去和他们一起庆祝吗？
Don't you wanna be out there celebrating?

966
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:14,830
不 我只想跟你在一起
No. I wanna be right here with you.

967
01:15:22,410 --> 01:15:24,940
我们没有赢得比赛
We didn't win the contest.

968
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:27,420
对
No.

969
01:15:27,450 --> 01:15:30,440
但鼓励奖也挺不错的
But the consolation prize was pretty good.

970
01:15:37,790 --> 01:15:41,700
我真开心能和你见证这一切
I'm so happy I can see all this with you.

971
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:52,040
怎么了？
What?

972
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,240
没什么
Nothing.

973
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,900
告诉我
Tell me.

974
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:00,210
卡洛斯
Carlos...

975
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:03,810
他总说等革命来了
he always said that when the revolution came...

976
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:07,050
卡斯特罗会把所有美国公司撵走
Castro will kick out all the Yankee companies.

977
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:12,060
但你还不确定啊
But you don't really know that.

978
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:15,330
是啊 但我是说…
No. I'm just saying that...

979
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,490
什么 我可能会被迫离开？
What, that I might have to leave?

980
01:16:17,530 --> 01:16:20,400
有可能
It could happen.

981
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:21,800
但他们不能那么做
But they wouldn't do that...

982
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:25,400
革命的思想不就是给人民自由嘛
not if the whole idea is to give people their freedom.

983
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,170
是古巴人民
Cuban people.

984
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:31,540
好吧 那你就和我们一起走
Well, then, you'll come with us.

985
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:33,110
我相信我爸可以帮我们
I'm sure my dad can work it out.

986
01:16:33,150 --> 01:16:35,170
那我家人呢？
And my family?

987
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:36,420
我们会派人去接他们
We'll send for them,

988
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:37,620
就像我们之前想的那样
just like we were always gonna do.

989
01:16:37,650 --> 01:16:40,310
凯蒂 我想离开是因为巴蒂斯塔的统治
Katey, I wanted to leave because of Batista,

990
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:41,110
但现在…
but now...

991
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:42,950
但你又不知道这里会怎样
But you don't know what life will be like here.

992
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:44,960
我是说 如果情况没有好转呢？
I mean, what if it doesn't get better?

993
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:48,760
我父亲为古巴革命牺牲了
My father died for this.

994
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,820
我得相信它会好起来
I have to believe it will.

995
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:54,730
我留在这能有所作为
I can make a difference here.

996
01:16:54,770 --> 01:16:56,500
这是你教给我的
You showed me that.

997
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,870
这是我的祖国 我的家
This is my country.It's my home.

998
01:17:09,890 --> 01:17:11,510
哦 感谢上帝
Oh, thank God.

999
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:13,180
凯蒂 你还好吗？
Katey, are you OK?

1000
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:16,790
我们要离开了
We're leaving.

1001
01:17:16,830 --> 01:17:19,190
是的 你爸爸正在安排这事儿
Yeah. Your father's making arrangements.

1002
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:41,310
把梳子给我
Give me that comb.

1003
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:45,450
你小时候 当我要帮你梳打结的头发时
When you were little, you used to hide under the bed...

1004
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:48,460
你会躲到床底下
when I'd try to comb out these knots.

1005
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:57,690
凯蒂 我一生就爱过你爸一个人
Katey, your father's been the only man in my life...

1006
01:17:57,730 --> 01:18:01,790
所以我不知道跟爱人告别是什么感觉
so I don't know what it's like to say good-bye to someone.

1007
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:06,070
但是跟我的另一个挚爱…舞蹈 告别时
Saying good-bye to dancing, the other love of my life...

1008
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:10,570
我的心都碎了
it broke my heart.

1009
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:18,640
后来你出生了 接着是苏西
Then you were born,and then Susie...

1010
01:18:18,690 --> 01:18:20,780
我太爱你们俩了 我…
and I loved you both so much that l...

1011
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:22,910
你想说一切都会好起来的
You're saying I'll get over it.

1012
01:18:22,910 --> 01:18:24,550
不 我不是这个意思
No, I'm not. No.

1013
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:28,790
我是说我知道你很痛苦
No. I'm saying I know you're hurting.

1014
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:32,100
一切都糟透了
Everything's such a mess.

1015
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:36,670
你可以选择
You have a choice.

1016
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:38,540
什么都不做
You can do nothing.

1017
01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:41,910
就躲在床下…
You can hide under the bed...

1018
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:44,540
或是梳开这些结
Or you can work through the knots.

1019
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,430
我会想你的
I'm gonna miss you.

1020
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:15,940
我也会想你的
I'm gonna miss you, too.

1021
01:19:17,850 --> 01:19:20,680
我会念着你离去
I am taking you with me.

1022
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:23,480
我会把你藏在心中
I am keeping you here.

1023
01:19:58,990 --> 01:20:00,790
哈维尔曾说过 跳舞
Javier once said that dancing...

1024
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:04,190
就是在那一刻成为理想的自己
is about being exactly who you wanna be in that moment.

1025
01:20:04,230 --> 01:20:06,890
和他跳舞时 我意识到我成为了
Dancing with him,I realized I was becoming...

1026
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:09,760
最想做的自己
exactly the woman I wanted to be.

1027
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,320
我们没有赢得比赛
We didn't win the contest...

1028
01:20:11,370 --> 01:20:13,670
但我们赢到了更重要的奖励
but we did win something more important to us.

1029
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:15,500
在哈瓦那的最后一晚
On my last night in Havana...

1030
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:18,700
我们是黑玫瑰酒吧的舞王和舞后
we were king and queen of La Rosa Negra.

1031
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:23,540
我们不知道何时能再见面
We didn't know when we would see each other again...

1032
01:21:23,570 --> 01:21:26,630
但我知道这不是我们的最后一支舞
but we knew that this wasn't our last dance.
