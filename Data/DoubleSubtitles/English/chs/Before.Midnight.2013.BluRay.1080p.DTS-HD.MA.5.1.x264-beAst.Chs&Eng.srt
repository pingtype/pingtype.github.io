大概会看会书
Probably read some.

10
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,330
别害怕给我回邮件 好吗
If I write you an e-mail, don't be scared to write me back.

11
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:44,980
让老爸了解下你的想法和近况
Ok? It won't kill you to let your old man know

12
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,770
又不会要了你的命
what you're thinking about or what is going on, you know?

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,610
好的

- Is your computer charged?  - Yeah.

22
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,270
等你到家以后
What do you think is the first thing

23
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,540
你第一件要做的事是什么
you are going to do when you get home?

24
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,160
我也不知道
I don't know.

25
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,690
我很珍惜咱们这次交流的机会
I really cherish this communication we have, you know.

26
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,140
- 只是你的回答都有点…  - 怎么了
- It's just... your answers are so...  - What?

27
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,000
坚持练习弹钢琴 好吗
Just keep practicing the piano, Ok?

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,840
你弹得很棒
You're really good

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,570
而且你都费了那么大功夫了
and they spend so much time at that school of yours.

30
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,800
别忘了音乐这东西
Just... just remember that music is actually something

31
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,140
会有助于你的生活
that you'll use in your life.

32
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,290
别忘了…你要芝麻味的 对吧
Don't forget to... you want those sesame things right?

33
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,050
那种特好吃
They're really good.

34
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,060
好的
Yeah.

35
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,670
你好
Γεια σου!

36
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,200
谢谢
Thank you.

37
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,010
我大概十月能过去
I probably make it over there in October.

38
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,710
我会尽量赶去看你的第一次独奏
I'll try to see you in that first recital

39
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,880
最好还能赶上看你踢场球赛
and hopefully catch a soccer game while I'm there.

40
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,950
谢谢
Ευχαριστώ!

41
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,190
今年我可能不会再踢足球了
I might not even play soccer this year.

42
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,360
这绝对是个错误的决定 相信我
That would be a big mistake, trust me.

43
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,010
我踢得不好
I'm not that good.

44
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,450
不 你踢得很好 非常好
Oh no, you're pretty good, you are.

45
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,760
可是…我错过了夏季训练营
I mean... I missed summer training camp,

46
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,120
所以不太可能让我回去了
so the chances of me starting are miniscule.

47
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,380
你直接告诉教练你的情况
Yes, well, just tell the coach your situation.

48
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,160
你爸爸住在欧洲 你其实特想去
Your dad lives in Europe and you really wanted to be there.

49
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,750
就是之类的借口 把责任推给我
You know... blah, blah, blame me,

50
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,880
我父母太讨厌了 但是我很上心的
my parents stink but I'm really serious.

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,750
但是我没那么上心 爸爸
But I'm not serious, Dad.

52
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,790
我不是很在意那个
I don't care that much.

53
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,140
你也不用现在就做决定 多考虑考虑
Well, you don't have to decide right now, just think about it.

54
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,650
我就是觉得团队运动很重要
All I'm saying is that team sports are important.

55
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,580
就到这儿了
Here we are.

56
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,120
我喜欢这个机场 你呢
I love this airport, don't you?

57
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,060
这里太酷了
It's awesome.

58
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,340
是吧 我也觉得很酷
Yeah, I know it's cool, right?

59
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,640
要见到你妈妈了 兴奋吗
Are you excited about seeing your mom?

60
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,610
- 是啊 还有我的伙伴们  - 没错
- Yeah, and all my friends.  - Yeah.

61
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,680
你的登机牌和护照都带了吗
What about your boarding pass, passport?

62
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,780
好的 转机你没问题吧
Ok... Do you feel confident about making the connection?

63
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,980
没事 我以前都是这样的
Yes, I have done this before.

64
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,370
但这次有点复杂
Yes, but this is a tricky connection.

65
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,180
飞机着陆后 记着坐着别起来
Just remember that when you land you stay in your seat,

66
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,510
会有航空公司的人来接你
somebody from the airline is going to come get you

67
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,430
把你带去登机口
and take you to the gate.

68
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,280
记住了吗
Ok?

69
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,750
- 没问题的  - 好吧
- It's not a problem.  - Ok, alright.

70
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,690
伙计
Oh boy.

71
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,400
看来真的得说再见了 是吧
Well... it looks like maybe we should just do this thing, huh?

72
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,160
过来 天啊
Ok, come here! Oh, God.

73
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,980
我会尽量赶去看你独奏的 好吗
I'll do my best to make that recital, Ok?

74
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,190
其实…我不介意的
You know... I wouldn't bother.

75
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,940
为什么这么说
What makes you say that?

76
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,540
我不是故意要刻薄你
Look, I'm not being mean,

77
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,980
但如果你不来看我独奏的话我会更轻松
but it would be easier if you didn't come to the recital.

78
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,290
怎么会呢
How come?

79
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,270
如果你选别的周末来看我更好
It would just be better if you visited on a nothing weekend.

80
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,510
我想看你弹琴
I want to see you play.

81
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,870
但是妈妈真的很讨厌你
Look. It's because mom hates you so much.

82
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,830
如果你在 她会特别紧张
She would be really stressed if you were there

83
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,310
弄得我也很有压力
and then it would be tense for me.

84
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,070
- 你知道吗  - 谢谢
- You know...  - Thank you.

85
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,730
而且咱们也没有时间一起玩
We wouldn't have any time to hang out anyway.

86
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,680
别担心 会有办法的
Do not worry about it, we'll figure that out.

87
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,830
我不希望你担心这个 好吗
I just don't want you to worry about it, you know?

88
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,120
你知道我有多想你 对吧
I mean... You know how much I miss you, right?

89
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,100
你为什么觉得她还那么讨厌我
Why do you think she still hates me so much?

90
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,660
我不知道
I don't know!

91
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,500
我觉得相比起来她更讨厌丹尼尔一些
I think she hates Daniel more than she hates you.

92
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,640
好吧
Yeah.

93
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,340
别担心 我会想办法的
Hey, don't worry about it, I'll figure something out.

94
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,500
我该进去了
We should just do this.

95
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,370
好的 还有什么我能帮忙的吗
Yeah, but is there anything I can do to help?

96
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,530
我不知道
I don't know.

97
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,180
- 但是你知道我爱你 对吗  - 当然
- But you know that I love you, right?  - Yeah.

98
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,410
我当然知道 这是我过得最好的一个夏天
Yeah, I know! This has been the best summer of my life!

99
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,790
- 真的吗  - 真的
- Really?  - Yeah!

100
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,390
我也这么想 看吧
For me too, see?

101
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,680
我就说过希腊会是个特别棒的地方
I told you, this whole Greece thing was going to be great.

102
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,550
确实是
And it was.

103
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,520
我爱你 伙计
Ok! I love you, pal.

104
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,710
我也爱你 爸爸
I love you too, Dad.

105
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,490
来 握个手
Ok... shake my hand.

106
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,780
再见

107
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,740
好的 好的

108
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,550
他跟德国人有个合作项目
Il a un projet avec les Allemands.

109
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,220
像往常一样
Comme d'habitude.

110
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:02,750
[卡拉玛塔机场]

111
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,770
听我说 会议气氛太压抑了
écoutez, on est stressé en cette réunion...

112
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,730
不 不 我是说下周
Non, bah, non. La semaine prochaine j'ai dit oui.

113
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,500
爱在午夜降临前

114
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,080

Ok, bon, très bien.

115
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,210
谢谢 您也一样 再见
Merci, oui, oui, vous aussi hein. Au revoir.

116
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,520
我被排除在外了
Ah, j'suis débusquée.

117
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,670
- 怎么了  - 他们投票反对
- What's going on?  - They voted against it!

118
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,060
反对什么 安装风力涡轮机吗
What? The wind turbines?

119
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,160
和这些人打了六个月的交道
6 months dealing with these people,

120
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:31,890
好不容易都同意了
they were all for it.

121
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,460
大家都认为这对地区有好处
Everyone agreed it was great for the region.

122
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,260
那出什么岔子了
So what happened?

123
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,060
现在他们都觉得涡轮机
Now they've decided that they don't like the way

124
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,800
放在山上的样子不好看
that it looks on that hill.

125
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,740
他们说那样有碍观瞻
It's "Ruining their view."

126
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,780
这件事不是都定下来了吗
I thought it was a done deal.

127
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,450
是啊 当时都说定了
It was! It practically was.

128
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,630
那他们怎么还能这么做
Can they do that?

129
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,790
当然 他们就这么做了 这事儿完了
Of course! They've done it, and it's over.

130
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:47,540
抱歉
I'm sorry.

131
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,030
没事 我只是太沮丧了
No, no, it's so frustrating.

132
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,440
我忍不下去了
I can't take it anymore.

133
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,970
我要接海米尔那活了
I'm gonna take that job with Hemir.

134
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,180
别 你不想为他们工作
No, you do not wanna work for them.

135
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,080
- 为什么  - 为政府工作吗
- Why not?  - For the government?

136
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,720
我觉得这届政府和以往不同
I think this government is different.

137
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,940
我们需要法律支持 这是唯一的办法
We need laws and it's the only way anything is gonna happen.

138
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,810
总有别的法子的
That's not the only way,

139
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,510
你们已经做了很多不错的工作了
you guys have been getting a lot of good work done.

140
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,880
我考虑过了 只有这办法行得通
Well, I've been thinking about it, this is the way to go.

141
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,200
好吧 那你可别忘了
Ok, well then let me remind you

142
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,570
你和那人合不来
that you do not like that guy.

143
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,050
以前你在他那工作的时候
The whole time you worked for him before

144
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:14,560
你整天都在抱怨
you complained about him constantly.

145
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,930
没错 他是个混蛋
Yeah, yeah, yeah... He can be an asshole

146
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:16,710
但是他能帮我把事搞定
but he gets things done.

147
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,880
从现在开始我就得这么想了
That's how I'm gonna be from now on.

148
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,470
- 好吧  - 我要做个贱人
- Ok.  - A real bitch, Ok?

149
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,230
每次我见他都觉得他是狼子野心
Well, every time I look at that guy all I see is ambition.

150
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,410
对不起 我就是不信任他
I mean, I'm sorry, I don't trust him.

151
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,110
他从非营利部门转入政府的唯一原因
The only reason he's going from not for profit to government

152
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,130
就是想有人能拍他马屁
is to have people kiss his ass.

153
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,840
我不在乎他怎么样 好吗
I don't care about him, Ok?

154
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,000
好吧 我就是觉得你会过得特痛苦
Ok, I think you are gonna be miserable.

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,930
面对数不清的政治活动和协商会议
With all the politicking and compromise.

156
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:35,750
无所谓
Whatever.

157
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,930
我已经决定了
I've made my decision.

158
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,580
[典出古希腊神话中诸神对西西弗斯的惩罚，让他每每接近成功又前功尽弃]
我不想再做把大石头推上山
I'm tired of being the do-gooder who rolls a boulder up a hill

159
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,330
再看着它滚下来的老好人了
and watches it roll down again.

160
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,870
他以前不是经常
Wasn't he the guy who used to throw his pens

161
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,960
扔笔砸他的助理吗
at his assistants and stuff?

162
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,250
我一年前就该接这份工作了
Ok, I should have taken this job a year ago.

163
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,670
我害怕是因为工作量太大
And I was scared because of the amount of work

164
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,030
但是我觉得这是个绝好的机会
but I think it's the best opportunity ever.

165
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,420
工资也更高 我决定了
And it's more money, and I'm doing it.

166
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,970
好吧 你确定吗
Ok, are you sure?

167
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,470
不确定 我什么都不确定 行吗
No, I'm not sure of anything, Ok?

168
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,030
如果我走了 那其他人都怎么办
I mean, what's gonna happen to everyone if I leave?

169
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,520
弗朗索瓦他们都指着我呢
Like Francois... I mean, they count on me.

170
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,360
你觉得呢
What do you think?

171
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:07,360
我该不该接那个工作
Should I take it or not?

172
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,230
不 不 我不发表意见
Oh, no no no, I don't have an opinion.

173
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,480
我只是不想你因为风力涡轮机的失败
No, I just don't want to see you rush into a decision

174
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,840
就匆忙做出决定
because this wind turbine crap is gone.

175
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,250
不仅是因为那个 好吗
It's not just that, Ok?

176
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,590
我都蠢蠢欲动一整个夏天了
It's been stirring me all summer.

177
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,810
- 不 我知道的  - 我要接这个工作 我决定了
- No, I know it has, I know.  - I should do it. I'm doing it!

178
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,700
那就接吧
Then do it.

179
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,270
我决定了 好吗
I'm doing it! Alright?

180
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,420
上帝啊 我真希望事情都能简单些
Oh God, I wish that things were simpler.

181
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,440
我走也完蛋 我留也完蛋
I mean... if I leave I get fucked, if I stay I get fucked.

182
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,510
永远都不确定
It's always a guess.

183
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,740
没错 这就是个操蛋的世界
Yeah, the world is fucked.

184
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,850
我觉得也是
Yeah, maybe.

185
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,560
天啊 好不容易能度个假期了
Oh God, we finally have a vacation,

186
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,530
头两个星期姑娘们还生病了
and the girls are sick for the first two weeks.

187
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,110
我明白
I know.

188
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,770
有个完美儿子 却还住在一百万英里外
With the perfect son who lives a million miles away.

189
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,570
或者是你毕生所爱
Or the love of your life

190
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,130
刮完胡子不知道清理下
who can't clean up after himself

191
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,590
还不肯学学怎么刮胡子
or learn how to shave.

192
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,520
谁说的
Who said that?

193
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,860
你不是在说这的清洁队队长吧
You're not talking about Captain Clean-up over here?

194
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,490
清洁队队长
Captain Clean-up?

195
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,300
那个在行动中都失踪了好几年的人
The one that's been missing in action all these years.

196
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,300
这时候你希望我说什么
What did you expect at this point?

197
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,830
上帝啊
God.

198
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,670
瞧瞧她们 太可爱了
Oh look at them, they're so cute.

199
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,980
就像连体婴儿似的
They look like conjoined twins.

200
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,550
天啊 我得给她们照张相
Oh my God, I'm gonna take a picture of this.

201
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,680
艾拉那个苹果吃完了吗
Hey, did Ella finish that apple?

202
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,020
你要从孩子嘴里抢食吃吗
You're going to take food out of your child's mouth?

203
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,530
- 是的  - 好吧
- Yeah.  - Ok.

204
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,510
都变成棕色了
This all brown.

205
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,250
没关系 还有一块可以吃
No no, there is a spot here.

206
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,880
艾拉 这是你爸爸偷你食物的证据
Ella, this is evidence of your father stealing food from you.

207
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,420
不管你变得贪食还是厌食
If you become bulimic or anorexic,

208
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,570
都不是我的错 别全怪你妈妈 好吗
it's not my fault, don't blame it all on your mother, Ok?

209
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,290
艾拉 这是个家庭分享苹果
Ella, this is a family apple.

210
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,130
我在教她们分享的重要性
I'm teaching them the value of sharing.

211
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,170
宝贝我爱你
I love you, honey.

212
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:45,380
多甜蜜啊 姑娘们会比咱们还要深刻地
Ahhh, so sweet, you girls will remember this vacation

213
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,540
铭记着这次与众不同的假期
very different than we will.

214
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,650
那是肯定的
That's for sure.

215
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,750
从我妈那里我就知道了
I see that with my mom,

216
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,160
她对我童年的印象和我完全不同
she remembers my childhood entirely different than I do.

217
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,640
别拍我了
Please stop filming me.

218
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,130
天啊 我爱你妈妈 你对她太苛刻了
God. I love your mom, you're always so hard on her.

219
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,040
因为你错过了那些操蛋的岁月
It is because you missed the fucked-up years,

220
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,560
你赶上了好时候
you are just getting the good era.

221
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,090
操蛋的岁月
The fucked-up years.

222
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,100
说到操蛋我想起来了
That reminds me, talking about fucked-up,

223
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,340
我告诉过你我那只艳后猫咪的事吗
did I ever tell you the story about my little Cleopatra kitty?

224
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,080
我记不得了 我要是说过你肯定有印象
I dunno? Ok. I think you would remember if I did.

225
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,230
故事是这样的
It's the story.

226
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,770
我小时候养了只猫 起名叫埃及艳后
You know when I was a little girl I had this cat named Cleopatra.

227
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,440
每到春天她都会跳出栅栏然后怀孕
And every spring she would jump the fence and get pregnant.

228
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,190
每次都会生出恰好两只猫咪
And always end up with a litter of exactly two kittens.

229
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,930
- 恰好两只  - 每次 每年都是两只
- Two kitties.  - Every time, every year, two cats.

230
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:32,720
很神奇 在我三十岁左右的某一天
I mean... it's just amazing, then one days I was like around 30.

231
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,320
我和我爸爸一起吃午饭 回忆过去
And I was having lunch with my dad and was remembering,

232
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,930
提到了小埃及艳后
mentioning little Cleopatra.

233
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,800
他说自己做过最艰难的事
And he was like... the hardest thing I ever had to do

234
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,090
就是杀掉那些可爱的小猫咪
was to kill those cute little kittens.

235
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,540
我惊讶极了
And I was like what?!

236
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,050
我告诉你 其实就是这么回事
It turns out ... listen to this.

237
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,480
有时她会一窝生出七只猫咪
There was sometimes up to 7 kittens in that litter.

238
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,740
我爸爸就拿走五只
But he would take 5 of them,

239
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,560
把它们放进一个塑料袋 然后灌乙醚
put them in a plastic bag, with a bunch of ether.

240
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,930
太可怕了
That is terrible.

241
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,730
就好像 他似乎忘记了
That was like... He had forgotten

242
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,110
当初他和妈妈是怎么骗我的了
the lie he and my mum had told me about the kittens.

243
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,450
他怎么决定该杀哪几只呢
How did he decide which ones he wanted to kill?

244
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,600
其实我倒真问过他
Well actually I asked him that.

245
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,350
是不是拿走最毛茸茸的 最可爱的
Did you take the, you know, the fluffiest, cutest?

246
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,590
然后他就开始哭 可怜的老爸
You know, and he just started to cry, poor daddy.

247
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,090
咱们说过要在这里停车的
Oh we said we would gonna stop.

248
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,450
孩子们要看遗迹
They wanted to see the ruins.

249
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,820
- 没错  - 艾拉特想看
- Yeah.  - Well, Ella really wanted to ...

250
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,290
是的 但是咱们该把她们叫醒吗
Yes, but should we wake them up?

251
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,130
咱们回机场的路上可以叫她们看
You know, on the way back to the airport, we can catch them.

252
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,430
- 咱们不会的  - 没错 大概是
- You know we won't.  - Yeah, probably not.

253
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,690
再见了古代遗迹 不过你有什么好看的
So long ancient ruins! What is so great about you, anyway?

254
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,310
窥一斑可见全豹
You seen one, you seen them all.

255
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,190
天啊 咱们真是对糟糕的父母
Oh my God, we are shitty parents.

256
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,620
咱们应该停车的
We should have stopped.

257
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,530
- 没事的  - 这是文化 掉头吧
- It's Ok.  - It's culture, come on, go back.

258
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,130
咱们得培养她们一些品质
We gotta put some character to these kids somehow.

259
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,310
咱们在教她们重要的一课
I mean, we are teaching them a valuable lesson.

260
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,610
在这世上 如果你睡过了 就错过了
If you snooze, you lose in this world.

261
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,820
然后等姑娘们进了戒毒所
And when the girls are in rehab suffering from

262
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,050
遭受十年的吸毒成瘾时
10 years of addiction to cocaine and speed.

263
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,060
她们会说 我只是从来都睡不踏实
They'll say, you just never felt comfortable going to sleep.

264
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,600
因为我们爸爸总是告诉我们说
Because our daddy always used to tell us

265
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,440
睡过了就错过了
that if you snooze, you lose.

266
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,760
这就又是你的错了
And that will be your fault, again.

267
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,430
- 咱们真是糟糕的父母  - 我知道
- Well we are shitty parents.  - I know.

268
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,290
和汉克告别糟透了
Saying goodbye to Hank sucked.

269
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,980
为什么 他不高兴吗
Why? Was he upset?

270
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,880
没有 他说这是他过得最好的暑假
No. He said it was the best summer of his life.

271
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,740
那很好啊 我不会太担心他的
Well that's great. I mean, I would not worry too much about him.

272
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,780
我们聊了很多
We spoke a bunch.

273
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,640
你知道他这辈子最关心什么吗
You know what his main concerns in life are?

274
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,490
什么
What?

275
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,240
青春痘和女孩子们对他的感觉
Pimples and how girls perceive him.

276
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,210
真是有其父必有其子
The apple doesn't fall far far from the tree I guess.

277
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,800
我才不是那样呢
I'm not like that.

278
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,480
拜托 你脑子里只有这个
Oh please! That's all you think about!

279
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,170
- 什么啊  - 女人啊
- What!  - Women!

280
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,970
我不是在抱怨
I mean... I'm not complaining.

281
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,730
我占用了你大部分精力
I'm getting a lot of attention.

282
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,590
- 但你总是在向姑娘抛媚眼  - 我没有
- But you never stop ogling girls.  - I don't ogle girls.

283
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:47,650
我不送秋波 我用眼神传达爱意
I don't ogle girls. I make love to them with my eyes.

284
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,950
我喜欢这个西班牙人 她是不是希腊人
Oh wow... I like the Spanish guy or is it Greek?

285
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:55,600
我不知道我来自何方 但我体毛旺盛
I do not know where I am from, but I'm very hairy.

286
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,970
我觉得 亨利可能有点
Well I think... you know... Henry might of...

287
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,340
- 怎么了  - 那个叫梅丽娜的小姑娘
- What?  - That little, Melina girl.

288
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,570
我不知道 他心动了 但是
I don't know. He had a crush, but...

289
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,580
你开玩笑吧
Are you kidding?

290
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,460
你觉得他为什么说这是最好的一个暑假
Why do you think he said it was the best summer of his life?

291
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,600
因为我们一起度过了快乐的时光吗
Because he and I had a good time together?

292
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,510
上帝啊
Jesus.

293
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,000
- 所以呢 你觉得他们接吻了吗  - 当然了
- So what? Do you think they kissed?  - Of course.

294
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,780
没错 接吻了 是的
Yeah, they kissed, yeah, yeah.

295
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,580
我发誓要保密的
I was sworn to secrecy

296
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,580
但是他告诉我他们接吻了
but he told me they kissed.

297
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,880
他怎么说的
What did he say?

298
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,920
我不应该告诉你的
I'm not supposed to tell you anything,

299
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,980
我不说了
so I'm not gonna talk.

300
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,210
- 说吧  - 好吧
- Come on!  - Ok!

301
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,390
他告诉我他在琢磨接吻的事
He told me he was concerned about the kissing.

302
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,430
而且是舌吻
You know tongue to tongue.

303
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,070
是的
Yeah.

304
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,870
但是他太可爱了
But he was... he was so cute,

305
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:49,210
紧张的脸通红 还咬着腮帮子
all nervous, all red, biting his cheek.

306
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,900
所以他和梅丽娜是认真的
So he and Melina were a real thing.

307
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,710
- 没错  - 那现在会发生什么
- Yeah.  - What's gonna happen now?

308
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:54,960
不知道
I don't know.

309
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,030
先做朋友 在脸书上互动
They must be friends, facebook...

310
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,430
他们至少会保持一段时间联系
They'll keep in touch at least for a while.

311
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:01,140
如果他们从此就共度余生了呢
Hey, what if they end up spending all their life together?

312
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,470
你太俗气了
You're so corny.

313
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,830
有时候我真觉得
Sometime's I'm just like...

314
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,660
真的吗 你以为你还是个十二岁的小姑娘
Are you? What are you? A 12-year-old girl?

315
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,760
你还记得你的初恋是谁吗
With your first love, do you even remember who it was?

316
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,550
我记得 是你
Yeah I do. It was you.

317
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,950
拜托 说得好像你二十三岁还是处男似的
Oh, please, like you were a virgin at 23.

318
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,930
我说的是初恋 不是第一次性经历
I said first love not first sexual experience.

319
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,170
好吧
Ok. Fine.

320
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,030
就是说我是你第一个爱上的女人
Like I'm the first woman you have ever fell in love with?

321
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,450
- 差不多  - 我觉得不是
- Yeah pretty much.  - i don't think so.

322
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,160
第一个我觉得心灵相通的女人
the first one I felt truly connected to.

323
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,620
怎么 我不是你的初恋吗
What? I wasn't your first love?

324
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,750
不 当然不是
No, of course not.

325
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,010
我还以为我是呢
No, I just thought I was.

326
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,380
- 杰西 别这样 太蠢了  - 不 没事 没关系的
- Jesse, stop this. It's dumb.  - No, it's Ok, it's not a big deal.

327
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,960
好吧 你多大了都
No. Ok, how old are you? Come on!

328
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,240
年底就整四十一岁了
41 on the last of the year.

329
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,000
咱们那晚你真的是费了老大劲了
You are so, so working on our little night.

330
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,580
勇士照我去战斗
I got a trojan in my billfold

331
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,790
哥们有根大火箭
and a rocket in my pocket.

332
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,740
我和一个美国青少年耗在一起了
I'm stuck with an American teenager.

333
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,310
我真不敢相信
I can't believe it,

334
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,590
咱们一会真要做那些事吗
do we have to do all that stuff later?

335
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,570
什么事 对了
What? Oh yeah, c'mon,

336
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,550
那对帕特里克来说很重要的
it means a lot to Patrick.

337
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,560
阿里阿德涅和斯特凡诺斯估计已经准备
Ariadni and Stefanos are probably already there

338
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,330
和孩子们再来一次快乐时光了
prepping the kids want to have one more big time.

339
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,590
- 不 不是  - 会很有趣的
- No, no.  - It's going to be fun.

340
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,550
不是 我是说之后去旅馆的事
No, I meant the hotel later.

341
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,440
我不是特别想去 你好 亲爱的
I'm not sure I want to go there... Hi, sweetie.

342
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,390
是的
Yeah.

343
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,850
好吧 好的 好的
Oh, Ok, Ok, Ok.

344
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,380
没事的
It's fine.

345
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,790
到伦敦给我打电话 旅途愉快 再见
Call me from London, have a good flight, bye.

346
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,130
飞机上说把电子设备都关掉
They were telling them to turn everything off.

347
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,270
他们要起飞了
They were about to take off

348
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,750
我叫他上了飞机给我打电话
and I asked him to call me from the plane.

349
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,950
我不喜欢他坐飞机
You know I don't like when he flies.

350
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,100
怎么了
What?

351
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,820
- 怎么了  - 我也不知道
- What is it?  - I just. I don't know.

352
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,440
我不确定我能一直这样下去
I just don't think I can keep doing this.

353
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,680
哪样
What?

354
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,770
每个暑假 每个圣诞节 就像是
Just every summer, every Christmas, you know, it's like..

355
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,080
我明白 我也不舒服
I know. It makes me uncomfortable.

356
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,250
不应该这么糟糕的
It just wouldn't be so bad.

357
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,220
要是我们把他送到寄宿学校
If I... If we were sending him to boarding school or something.

358
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,720
我不知道
I don't know.

359
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,520
要是我跟他妈妈的关系能缓和点
If his mom and I got along a little bit better.

360
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,360
我知道 像亲手把他送回敌人的阵线去
I know, it's like we're sending him back across enemy lines.

361
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,470
这次我真的没法无所谓
It really hit me this time, you know?

362
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,630
他就要去读高中了 整整四年啊
He's gonna be a freshman in high school 4 more years,

363
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,320
要开始学会独立了
and he's gonna be on his own.

364
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,590
也许是件好事
Maybe that's the good news,

365
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,370
我们也只有四年…
we only have four more years of this...

366
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,860
不 现在是关键时刻
No, no, this is the crucial time,

367
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,920
我就觉得自己应该陪着他
I just feel I should be there for him, you know.

368
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,800
不然就没机会了 你懂吗
Like it's now or never, you know?

369
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,380
我不懂 你什么意思
No. what do you mean?

370
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,870
我知道总有一天
I thought that somehow he would

371
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,980
他会离开我们
end up living with us, somewhere along the way.

372
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,290
时光飞逝 当你有所察觉时
Time has gone by so fast and look,

373
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,020
他已经要上高中了
here we are it's high school.

374
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,760
然后是谈恋爱 再来就该申请大学了
It's girls, and next thing you know, is College applications.

375
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,150
是的 没错 也许是时候了
Yeah, you're right, maybe it's time,

376
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,380
我真的觉得是时候告诉他妈妈这一切
I mean, I really think it's time to tell his mom all this,

377
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,860
问她愿不愿意让孩子跟我们一块住
and ask if he can live with us.

378
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,760
孩子肯定很乐意
He'd love it!

379
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,590
这是绝对不可能的 好吗
That's never gonna happen. Right?

380
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,380
除了法定义务 她什么都不会给我的
She will never give me one thing she is not legally obligated to.

381
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,420
还要不要找回那个律师
Do you want to call that lawyer again?

382
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,890
不要 我不喜欢他 他很差劲
No, I don't like that guy, he's terrible.

383
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,820
要我打给孩子他妈吗
Should I call his mother?

384
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,060
不要 别再打了
No, please. Never again.

385
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,770
他甚至还不懂怎么扔棒球
I mean the kid doesn't even know how to throw a baseball!

386
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,320
谁在乎啊
Who cares.

387
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,040
他用肘发力 扔得跟小女生一样
He just, he eads with his elbow, he throws like a girl.

388
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:20,840
这不能怪你
It's not your fault.

389
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,880
不 就都怪我
No, it is my fault,

390
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,040
父亲就该教会儿子这些
a father is supposed to teach you that.

391
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,710
他只是不喜欢打棒球 不能怪他
Ok. he just doesn't like baseball, you can't blame him.

392
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,580
我只是用这个例子来比喻做其他事情
It's just an example, it's a metaphor for everything.

393
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,850
他马上就十四岁了 他需要父亲的陪伴
He's turning 14 and he needs to be with his father.

394
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,930
杰西 我是不会搬去芝加哥的
Jesse, I'm not moving to Chicago.

395
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,740
什么 我有说吗
What? Did I ask you to?

396
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,650
你怎么会这样想
Where did that come from?

397
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,560
我只是想到什么说什么
I'm just thinking out loud.

398
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,960
我曾经答应过自己不要这么冲动
I mean, this is the one thing I promised myself I would never do.

399
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,480
现在我看开了 冲动就冲动吧
And I look up and I'm doing it!

400
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,800
听着 你是个好父亲
Listen, you're a wonderful father.

401
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,330
他珍惜这段父子关系
He loves the relationship you have,

402
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,590
他珍惜你给他写的信
he loves the letters you send him.

403
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,010
我的信他连看都没看
He doesn't even read the letters.

404
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:55,790
他当然看了你的信
Of course he reads them,

405
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,700
他只是没有给你回…
he just doesn't complement the writing the way you want...

406
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,030
我只是知道 要是错过了这几年
I just know that if I miss these years,

407
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,540
就永远也补不回来了
they are never coming back.

408
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,360
老天
Oh my God.

409
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:05,870
怎么了
What?

410
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,090
这就是结束的时刻
This is where it ends.

411
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,080
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

412
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,940
- 这就是人们分手的节奏  - 老天
- This is how people start breaking up.  - Oh my god.

413
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,100
- 不是的  - 你这是小题大做
- No, no, no.  - You just jumped off a cliff.

414
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,110
不是 我要记下今天
No, no. I'm marking this,

415
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,520
就在今天 你引爆了
this is the day you light the ticking bomb,

416
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,390
了结我们性命的定时炸弹
that will destroy our lives, yeah?

417
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,680
好的 首先
Ok, well, first off,

418
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,020
不是引爆定时炸弹
you don't light a ticking bomb,

419
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,710
而是安装 它有定时器
you set it, it has a timer.

420
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,570
- 所以才能定时  - 是吗 管他呢
- That's why it ticks.  - Oh, yeah. whatever.

421
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,810
现在已经开始倒计时了
You know what? It's ticking right now.

422
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,500
说什么也没用
And this is how it happens.

423
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,890
你自己不高兴
You are unhappy and blame it

424
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,090
却怪别人满怀怨恨
on the other person Resentment grows,

425
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,600
等一切都崩溃了 你就提出分手
everything falls apart and you break up.

426
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,390
- 你就是这样  - 你这样做只是想让我闭嘴
- That's it.  - You are just doing this to shut me up.

427
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,180
不是 根本不是
Not at all! Not at all!

428
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,400
你是 而且你也这样做了
No, you are, and that's what you are doing, yeah.

429
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,090
不是 我是觉得很惊讶
No, I'm actually surprised,

430
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:43,890
在经历了那么多…
we've lasted this long...

431
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,260
好的 直接说你想说的
Ok. So here it comes out...

432
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,880
我们本形同陌路 但却萍水相逢
We are on parallel tracks a while but now the tracks have crossed,

433
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,700
现在却要分道扬镳了
and I'm going west and you're going east.

434
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,480
就是这样分手的
And believe me this is how it happens.

435
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,770
我早就知道了 就像卡特琳跟亚历山大…
I've seen it, ok? Katrin, Alexandre...

436
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,800
- 你在开玩笑吧  - 没有
- You're kidding, right?  - Well, no.

437
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,940
你可以当玩笑 但我是认真的
I'm kidding, and I'm not.

438
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:00,960
好吧
Right.

439
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,070
别那么…
Just...

440
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,310
- 就这样了  - 我想看古代遗迹
- This is it.  - I want watch ancient ruins.

441
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,450
那里关门了
Oh, they were closed.

442
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,690
宝贝 下次去机场的时候
Sweetie you know what, we decided to catch them,

443
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,730
我们再去看 好吗
when we're on the way back to the airport. Ok?

444
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,850
没错 我们会早点启程 对吧
Exactly, we'll leave early, right?

445
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,280
是的
Yes!

446
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,950
我的苹果呢
What happened to my apple?

447
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,280
你的苹果…
Your apple...

448
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,170
你的苹果吗 已经被你吃完了啊
Ta pomme, mais elle était finie cette pomme.

449
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,500
是吧
Right?

450
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,350
你们去买冰淇淋吧 我们大概一点出发
Allez vous chercher des glaces, on y passe à une heure.

451
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,770
- 把清单拿来  - 我没拿
- Give me the list.  - I don't have it.

452
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,530
在你钱包里 钱包拿来
It's in your wallet! And your wallet.

453
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,890
我是将军
Ok, I am the General.

454
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,740
妮娜上尉 去帮我找厕纸

遵命
Oui!

456
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,510
谁任命你当将军的
Who made you General?

457
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,430
我是将军 好吗
The General, ok?

458
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,360
艾拉上尉 您去找卷纸

460
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,560
- 遵命  - 待命
- Oui!  - à vos ordres!

461
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,750
特别警告 你什么都不许拿
Private Clean-up, you don't touch anything!

462
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,070
好的 长官
D'accord.

463
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,680
别走太快
Il vous faut pas aller trop vite.

464
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,590
妮娜 放到厨房去
Nina, la cuisine.

465
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,020
妮娜 听到没

466
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,230
我的队友呢 我的队友呢
Where is my team! Where is my team!

467

去帮我找点番茄过来
Allez me chercher des tomates.

468
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,440
那边 那边
Là-bas, là-bas!

469
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,390
- 是这个吗  - 是的
- Celles-là?  - Ah... oui!

470
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,590
挑红的
The red one.

471
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,460
- 这个行吗  - 很好
- Celle-là?  - Très bien!

472
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,990
辣椒 接住
Ok! Pepper!

473
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,830
其实两本我都读过
Actually I read them both.

474
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,100
第一本叫《彼时此刻》
The first one is called "That time",

475
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,140
第二本叫《此时此刻》
and the second one is "This time".

476
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,220
不对 第一本叫《此时此刻》
No, the first is "This time",

477
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,300
第二本叫《彼时此刻》
and the second is "That time".

478
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:47,930
没错
Yeah.

479
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:50,780
我们还开玩笑 第一本帮我们组建家庭
We've got a joke in our family that "This" Brought us together,

480
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,250
第二本帮我们还房贷
and "That" Paid for our apartment.

481
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,200
好吧
Ok.

482
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,190
但瑟琳的角色有点怪 伙计
But it must be a little weird for Celine, man.

483
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,020
她在书中的表现 不觉得吗
The way that she's in the book. No?

484
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,100
会吗 可能她已习以为常了
Why? I think she has gotten used to it.

485
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,510
第二本写得真香艳 伙计
But the second one is sexy, man.

486
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,630
男主角错过飞机后 他们就把窗户关上
When he misses the plane and they blackout the windows,

487
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,400
然后没日没夜地做爱
and have sex for days and days and days.

488
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,610
就像明天就是世界末日一样
Like there's no tomorrow.

489
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,040
你们真是那样吗
Did you guys actually do that?

490
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,210
是真的 对吧
You did that, huh?

491
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,200
你看过杰西的第三本书没
Have you read Jesse's third book?

492
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,180
事实上比前两本写得好
It's actually better than the first two.

493
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,090
反正写的时间
It certainly took longer

494
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,960
比前两本加起来都要长
to write than the first two put together.

495
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,370
我没看第三本 我老婆给我了
No, the third one I didn't read, I mean my wife gave it to me,

496
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,200
但我觉得有点长
but it's a just a little bit too long for me.

497
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,010
连书名也很长 叫什么来着
Even the title is long. What's the title?

498
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,380
《长年上演的小众话剧
"Temporary cast members of a long-running

499
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,390
中的临时演员们》
but little-seen production of a play called fleeting"

500
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,020
我说得没错吧
Well, exactly my point.

501
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,950
不止是你 其他人也觉得它太长了
You're not alone, everybody else thought it was too long.

502
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:38,000
这本书写得更好 更有野心
It is a better book, it's so much more ambitious.

503
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,170
他说什么
What was that?

504
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,540
他说 三本书他都喜欢
No, he says, he likes... he likes all the books.

505
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,380
真的
He does.

506
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,650
我喜欢这里 这里棒极了
I mean I love it here. This place is amazing,

507
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,830
番茄也棒极了
those tomatoes are so amazing.

508
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:00,100
闻起来都觉得好吃 真好闻
I can smell them, they smell so good.

509
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,860
是的 帕特里克对此引以为豪
Yeah. Patrick is very proud of them.

510
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,360
我知道这样想很蠢 不过…
I know it's stupid but...

511
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:06,960
当决定离开巴黎到这来时
When we were about to leave Paris,

512
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,310
其实我很担心
I was all nervous we were about to come here.

513
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,370
现在要走了 却又舍不得
And now we're about to leave and I do not wanna go.

514
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,010
- 为什么会担心  - 是啊 为什么
- Why were you nervous?  - Yes, why was that?

515
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,760
我不知道 这地方承载着
I do not know. this place is so full of

516
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,810
千百年的悲欢离合
thousands of years of myth and tragedies,

517
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,420
我害怕有不好的事要发生
and I thought something tragic was gonna happen.

518
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,510
[弥诺陶洛斯：古希腊神话中人身牛头怪物]
你怕弥诺陶洛斯会来吃你的小孩
You thought the Minotaur was going to eat your children.

519
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,410
是的
Yes.

520
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,340
没错
Exactly.

521
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:31,250
这些天来 我有了一个想法
All the time I've been here I've been working on this idea about

522
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,560
是关于一群大脑异常的人
a group of different people with all these brain abnormalities.

523
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,290
我想从他们的独特视角出发
So the book would be like a day in their life,

524
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,700
来观察他们日常生活中的一天
from all their unique points of view,

525
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,280
就比如有位老太太
Right? Like there's this older lady who has the condition that

526
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,850
她会沉浸在似曾相识的感觉当中
makes you feel like you're in a perpetual state of deja vu.

527
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,590
每一个经历过的场景
And every single experience she has,

528
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,020
她都会觉得似曾相识
she feels like she's had it before.

529
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,440
她有可能坐在这
I mean she could be sitting here with us

530
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,450
很正常地跟我们聊天
talking seemingly functional right?

531
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,080
其实她脑子里在想
And in her head she's thinking,

532
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,070
这话他刚刚不是说过了吗
didn't he already say that?

533
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,260
会不会我们昨天也在这
I mean, weren't we here yesterday?

534
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,080
展开了一模一样的谈话
Having this exact same conversation?

535
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,270
就像有即视感
So just like deja vu?

536
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,480
是的 不过更频繁
Yeah, except all the time.

537
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,300
她所接触过的每一样事物
That's the thing, right, everything she takes in.

538
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,190
一份早餐 一张报纸 一场电影
A breakfast, a newspaper, a movie.

539
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,190
她都认为自己早就经历过
She is convinced she's encountered it already.

540
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,220
这种情况真的存在吗
Is that a real condition?

541
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,270
是的 叫做持续性即视…
Yeah, it is called persistent Dejav...

542
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,460
确实存在 我不会拼而已
It's real but I can't pronounce it.

543
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,070
接着是截然相反的两个人
There are two other characters with facial recognition extremes.

544
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:22,800
一个二十年来从来都认不出自己的老婆
There is one guy and he can not recognize his wife for 20 years.

545
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,450
他看着镜子中的自己
He looks at himself in the mirror,

546
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:29,090
会感到陌生
and he feels disconnected with that man he's looking at.

547
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,600
另一个角色则刚好相反
And the other character is the opposite.

548
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,920
这位中年主妇有着
A middle-aged housewife with a categorical exacting memory

549
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,280
对人过目不忘的本领
of every face she has ever seen.

550
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,030
虽在大城市 对她而言却与小城镇无异
And she lives in a big city but to her it is a small town.

551
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,740
就比如有辆计程车经过 她就会想
Like a taxi drives past and she thinks,

552
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,120
那不就是三年前的圣诞节
"Oh that's the driver who dropped me off

553
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,050
[孚日广场：巴黎最古老的广场]
在孚日广场放下我的司机吗
at Place des Vosges three Christmases ago."

554
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:48,090
就比如看见有位老太太走在街上
Like some old lady, walking on the street,

555
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:51,060
她就会想 她是去年在地铁上
she thinks, "Oh! She sat two seats down from me

556
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,260
坐在我后两位的老太太
on the metro last year."

557
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,400
所以她对遇见的每个人
So everyone she meets, you know,

558
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,430
都感到亲密无间
to her feels intimate and connected.

559
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,870
我喜欢你说的第一个
Well, I'm like the first guy,

560
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,330
因为大多时候我也是见人就忘
I feel connected to nothing most of the time.

561
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,730
阿奇里斯 安娜 你们好
Hey! Achilleas! Anna! Hey guys.

562
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,400
看这孩子 他暑假过得比我们都要好
Look at this kid, he is having the best summer of us all.

563
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,570
所以你要说的就是这三个角色 对吗
So, you were saying these three characters, right?

564
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,670
不 这只是那一群人当中的三个角色
No. It's not just three characters, it's a whole group of people.

565
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,520
我现在也有一章是写
Like I'm working on a Chapter right now,

566
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,960
一个叫阿奇里斯的年轻希腊男子
about a young Greek man named Achilleas.

567
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,490
- 我吗  - 是以你命名的
- Me?  - Well, he's named after you.

568
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,790
这个人陷入了迷阵
And this guy is caught in a loop,

569
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,340
在他看来一切都是转瞬即逝的
all he sees is the transient nature of everything.

570
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,540
就像他看到这片海
Like he looks out to the sea, and he thinks of the day

571
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,660
他想到的是它干涸和堆满化石的一天
it's gonna be dry and littered with fossils.

572
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:41,580
怎么说呢 听上去有点做作
Well, I do not know. Sounds a little pretentious to me.

573
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,260
不 不会做作 我保证
No no no, it won't be pretentious, I promise, I promise.

574
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,020
会很有趣 真的很有趣
It's gonna be funny. Really funny.

575
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,050
他捡到一本书马上想到的是
He picks up a book and immediately wonders,

576
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,100
最后读到这本书的人会是谁
who's gonna be the last person to read this?

577
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,920
- 这有趣吗  - 有时候我也会那样想
- And that's funny?  - Sometimes I kind of think like that.

578
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,010
所以他不喜欢乳房啊 车啊 饮酒啊
Ok, so he does not get excited about

579
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,590
对这些都不感兴趣
tits, cars, booze, nothing?

580
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,610
- 一心只想着死亡  - 也不全是死亡
- Just thinks about death.  - Well, not so much death.

581
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,750
像变了一个人似的
It's like transformation, you know,

582
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,010
对于未来过于杞人忧天
like he is seeing too far in the future.

583
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,770
- 好吧  - 我喜欢这个想法
- Ok.  - I like this idea for a novel.

584
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:10,570
不过你应该加个像我一样的老头上去
But you should add a character of an old man like me.

585
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,060
一个连早餐吃过什么都会忘的人
A poor sapp who can't remember what he ate for breakfast,

586
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,250
但对于十四岁那年在珠儿酒吧
But still hear the song that was playing,

587
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,260
[希拉·坎贝尔：八十年代美国女影星]
看到希拉·坎贝尔半裸跳舞时
when Sheila Campbell danced topless

588
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,920
所听到的音乐记忆犹新
on the bar at Jurees when he was 14 years old.

589
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:20,800
这提议很不错
That would work.

590
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,130
这些人都在时间里迷失了 对吧
Ok. you have these people lost in time, right?

591
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,780
他们之间的联系在哪 是通过做爱吗
What is the connection? Are they gonna have sex?

592
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,790
难道不需要把他们联系到一起吗
Don't you need something like that?

593
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,680
他们并非迷失在时间里 而是感知出了问题
It's not time they have lost in, right? It's like, perception.

594
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,750
这样说吧
That's the deal,

595
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,020
我打算把整部小说设置在一部电影当中
I'm thinking of setting the whole novel at a movie.

596
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,600
每个角色都会跟
Like every character in some way

597
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,930
[《码头风云》：马龙白兰度主演的奥斯卡获奖影片]
《码头风云》这部电影产生一定的联系
comes into contact with the film "On the Waterfront".

598
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,510
看过《码头风云》没
Have you seen On the Waterfront?

599
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,140
《码头风云》吗
On the Waterfront?

600
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,600
白兰度演的吗
With Brando?

601
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,880
书的第一章发生于一九五四年的一个周末
The first chapter of the book is opening at a weekend

602
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,620
在时代广场
in Times Square in 1954.

603
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,940
有着持续性即视感的老太太
That old lady with perpetual deja vu

604
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,940
走去看日场放映
walks into the matinee screening,

605
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,690
但她却满脑子疑惑
except the whole time she's thinking,

606
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,250
我不是已经看过了吗
"Haven't I already seen this?"

607
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,060
另外一章发生在一九七九年
Yeah, and then in another chapter

608
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,120
巴黎的一个电影学习班里
is a 1979 Paris film studies class.

609
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,010
接下来会发生在一九九三年
Then we have a Kazan

610
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,290
慕尼黑的一场喀山回顾展里
retrospective in Munich in 1993.

611
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,830
这讲的就是时间 怎么不是时间呢
Well man, that is time. How is that not time?

612
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:14,460
确实与时间有关 但讲的更多的是感知
Yeah, it's time, but it's more perception.

613
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,540
- 你不喜欢吗  - 我怕你又写很长
- You don't like it?  - I think it's gonna be too long!

614
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:22,220
我喜欢 别听他的 做单车的懂什么
Well. I like it. Do not listen to him, he makes bicycles.

615
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,240
记得寄一份到我加勒的地址
Send it to me in Galles.

616
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,860
这是肯定的
Will do!

617
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,310
在法国番茄跟辣椒
In France we stuff the tomatoes with tomatoes,

618
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,530
会酿上不同的馅
and the peppers with peppers.

619
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:42,390
真的吗 我们这都酿同一种馅
Oh, really? Because we use the same stuffing for both.

620
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:45,530
这样你就能尝到馅糅合香草的味道
Because of the way it reacts with the leaves you can taste.

621
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,370
好吧
Ok.

622
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,680
瑟琳 别酿太满
Oh, and Celine, make sure you don't stuff them too much,

623
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,360
不然待会馅溢出烤炉
because of the way it overflows in the oven later.

624
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,790
会比较难清洁
It gets kind of nasty.

625
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,630
你做的很好 瑟琳
You're doing fine, Celine.

626
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,750
千万要记住 别听斯特凡诺斯的
And especially do not listen to Stefanos here.

627
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,100
他没做过这道菜
Because he has never made this dish before,

628
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,950
实际上他就没做过菜
or any other dish, for that matter.

629
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,990
别拿着刀吵架
Stop fighting with knives!

630
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,550
别这样 别拿着刀吵架
Stop it! Stop fighting with knives!

631
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,850
我们没有吵架 我们是在商量
We're not fighting, we are negotiating.

632
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,100
商量 你们管这叫商量
Negotiating. That's how you call it?

633
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,770
哇 带着刀的商量啊
Wow, négociation avec des couteaux!

634
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,030
完全正确
Exactement!

635
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,050
这是我们相处的方式
It is a system that we have.

636
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,910
看来你们找到了适合你们的方式
So you found the system that works for you.

637
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,190
我想这就叫磨合
I thought it was called having a "Relationship".

638
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,850
不过我喜欢你们的说法 很棒
But I like system, that's pretty good.

639
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,840
- 这可以了吧  - 可以了
- That's ready, right?  - That's ready.

640
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,710
你呢 你的相处方式是什么
Toi, c'est quoi ton system?

641
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,720
- 我是这个  - 不错嘛
- Celui-là.  - Pas mal.

642
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,880
我们以前也那样
We used to have that system.

643
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,950
别游太远
Not too far you guys!

644
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,410
我想借这顿饭机会
Alright, I just don't want to let this meal go by

645
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,670
跟在座各位说声谢谢
without just saying thank you to everyone.

646
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,720
特别是你 帕特里克
And especially you, Patrick.

647
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,140
这六周多亏有你的招待
we had no idea what we were getting into these last six weeks.

648
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,910
我在大学里收到一份邀约
A letter arrives from the university

649
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:59,920
一位伟大的作家邀请我们
inviting us to the Southern Peloponnese of Greece

650
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,270
到他希腊南伯罗奔尼萨的旅舍去度假
to the guesthouse of a great writer.

651
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,210
好啊 为什么拒绝
Sure! Why not?

652
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,350
今天早上在机场
And then at the airport earlier today.

653
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,700
汉克对我说
Hank turns to me and he says that

654
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,820
这是他度过最棒的暑假
this has been the greatest summer of his life.

655
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:16,420
我也一样 谢谢你 帕特里克
And I have to say the same, so thank you, Patrick!

656
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,770
我不仅要敬你为我和我的家人所做的一切
And not just for what you done for me and my family,

657
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:20,900
还要敬你一直以来的慷慨奉献
But for all the ways that you have given back, alright?

658
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:21,670
敬帕特里克
To Patrick!

659
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,860
谢谢 谢谢
Thank you, thank you, thank you,

660
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,880
当我第一次在机场看见你
you know when I first saw you at the airport.

661
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,570
我心想 这男的穿成这样
I thought, no way, a man dressed like that

662
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:35,060
怎么可能是个作家
could be a man of letters.

663
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,770
但现在我总算找出原因了
But now. I think I've learned your secret,

664
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,520
在过去十年里也出现过许多优秀的作家
we've had many great writers over the past decade,

665
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,970
但没有一位的妻子比作家本身还要有意思
but never one who had a partner more interesting than themselves.

666
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:53,750
谁说不是呢
I'm telling you.

667
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,330
瑟琳 感谢你和你的女儿
And Celine, it's been so great to

668
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,900
为这里带来了无限的生机
have you and your daughters' wonderful vitality around here.

669
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,130
同时也很高兴能为你引见
And I'm so happy you were able to meet

670
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,330
我的好朋友娜塔莉
my dear friend Natalia.

671
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,530
她的丈夫伊莱亚斯跟我情同手足
Whose husband Elias was like a brother to me.

672
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,310
对上校的事我感到很抱歉
I'm so sorry about the Colonel.

673
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,690
- 我说的是上次…  - 是我的错
- I mean the early...  - I should... It was my fault.

674
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:16,810
我跟安娜也要感谢这次暑假邀约
Thanks for including Anna and me this summer.

675
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,690
因为他平常只会让我去工作
Because you know he usually puts me to work.

676
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,800
但我把安娜带来时
But when I bring Anna,

677
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,850
他让我坐在大人桌上
he let me sit at the table of the grown-ups.

678
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,310
欢迎来到大人桌
Welcome to the grown-up's table!

679
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,680
你们俩在一起多久了
How long have you two been together?

680
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,070
从上个暑假到现在
Since last summer.

681
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,370
我们一年前在这里邂逅
We met one year ago here,

682
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,380
那是在我要回雅典之前
in my last days with Grandpa,

683
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,700
陪伴爷爷的最后几天
before I had to go back to Athens.

684
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,750
是的 我们在闭幕晚会上相遇
Yes, we met at my closing night cast party.

685
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,000
那时候我在剧院演莎翁的戏
I was doing Shakespeare in the theater.

686
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,880
你演什么角色
Who did you play?

687
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,000
我演《冬天的故事》里的潘狄塔
I was Perdita. The winter's tale.

688
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,650
她演得很好
She was fantastic.

689
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,380
帕特里克 记得我们看的那次吗
Remember, Patrick, we went to there?

690
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:50,020
潘狄塔 当你跳舞时
Perdita, "When you do dance,

691
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,740
我希望你是浩淼海洋中的一道波浪
I wish you a wave o' th' sea,

692
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,920
这样就已足够
that you might ever do Nothing but that."

693
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,780
你演得
The way you just performed,

694
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,170
比剧中那小伙子好多了
that was much better than the guy in the play.

695
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,710
人们至今还对那部剧津津乐道
People are still talking about that production.

696
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,680
但更棒的在宴会后 那是我俩头次见面
But the after-party was even better, it was when we met.

697
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,550
对 我开着老款的BSA型摩托车
Yeah, I had an old BSA motorcycle.

698
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,330
不错
Nice.

699
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,470
整晚我们都在兜风
So... we drove around all night,

700
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,130
最后我们开回剧院
and then I had to drive her back to the theater,

701
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,220
去拿她的东西
to get her stuff.

702
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,560
那时天已经蒙蒙亮了
And it was the dawn.

703
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,610
我永远忘不了那一刻
And I'll never forget it.

704
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,380
那是个露天剧场 可容纳一万两千人
It was outdoors and it seats 12000 people,

705
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,750
空空荡荡的
and it was now completely empty.

706
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,600
她径直走到最后一排坐下
And she was sitting way up in the back row.

707
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,220
所以 我登上舞台
So... I went up on stage

708
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,790
低声对她说
and whispered to her.

709
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,670
声音的传播好奇妙
The acoustics there are incredible.

710
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:35,820
我先看到他的嘴在动
I could see his mouth move and then 3 seconds later,

711
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,920
三秒后我才听到他的声音
I could hear his voice in my ear.

712
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,470
他说的什么
What did he say?

713
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,020
- 好  - 好
- OK!  - Right.

714
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,940
小秘密
It is private.

715
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,830
然后她飞回巴黎住些日子
And then she had to fly back to Paris a couple of days later.

716
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,960
你们怎么联络呢
How did you keep in touch?

717
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,970
我们用视频聊天
We Skyped.

718
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,560
几乎天天聊
Pretty much every day since then.

719
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,180
我们睡觉时
And we are in bed,

720
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:55,890
必然会把电脑放在枕边
we have a thing of putting our laptop by the pillow,

721
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,690
看着对方一起入睡
and... falling asleep together

722
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,920
听着又新鲜又浪漫
Oh that's the new romance.

723
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,970
等醒来 屏幕基本都定格在
And when I wake up the screen is usually frozen

724
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:06,980
一些很滑稽的姿势 就像这样
and Anna's face is in some funny position like...

725
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,930
我来问个问题
Can I ask you a question?

726
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,370
你们视频聊天时
When you guys Skype

727
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,390
有点小疯狂的事情没有
Do you, you know... do you go a little crazy?

728
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,010
天 你的节操呢
My God! You're being so vulgar!

729
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,060
这无关什么节操
No, nothing to vulgar.

730
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,920
我是个对虚拟世界比较感性趣的
I'm just being a amateur anthropologist

731
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,090
只停留在理论水平的业余人类学家
who is interested in the virtual world on a theoretical level.

732
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,600
你倒成了人类学家了
Now you're an anthropologist.

733
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,360
没错 题目是未来的性爱
Yes, the sex of the near future.

734
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,790
我这不是胡扯
And I'm not making this up but it's

735
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:34,350
将来会在你的生殖器里放入个装置
gonna be just like plugging in something in your genitals.

736
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,200
冒犯了 可以根据你的需要
I'm sorry. And you can have sexual intercourse

737
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,900
来选择跟谁性交
with anyone of your choice.

738
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,060
专门为你定制
You'll be able to programme in all your preferences.

739
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,650
满足你的要求
You'll be able to type in exactly what you want.

740
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,990
比如让玛丽莲·梦露 在你耳边轻语
Marilyn Monroe to whisper in your ear.

741
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:49,680
听起来超赞 没错
I might like that! Yes!

742
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,060
为什么不呢
I mean... Why not?

743
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,490
越来越多的人们
More and more of our

744
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:58,160
把时间放到了虚拟世界上
experiences are taking place in the virtual world.

745
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,750
是的
Yeah...

746
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:02,310
你是作家 如果有一天电脑能写出
And you're a writer. How are you gonna feel when

747
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,830
比战争与和平还好的书 你会怎么想
Computers can write a better book than 'War and Peace'

748
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,040
不会有那一天的
That will never happen.

749
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:09,490
我想现在唯一的问题是什么时候会发生
I think the only question is when it's going to happen.

750
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:12,190
我想与卡斯特罗的感觉差不多
I think I will probably feel about the same way as Kasparov

751
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:12,780
记得吧
you remember, all those

752
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,550
所有那些棋手都不能战胜的
chess players felt when they could no compete

753
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,540
超级电脑
with that big-ass computer...

754
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,690
- 深蓝  - 对对 就是那个
- The big blue.  - Right, right.

755
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,690
最初大家都认为
Remember at first thought

756
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,740
电脑不能战胜人类
nobody thought a computer could ever beat our best.

757
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:24,450
机器没有人类那妙不可言的天资
A machine lacks that ineffable human instinct.

758
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:27,060
现在我们却输得一塌糊涂
You know and now we can't even compete.

759
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,060
我看过一篇文章
I saw a documentary where

760
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,620
上面说他们用小白鼠做了个实验
they were doing an experiment on a lab rat.

761
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,590
将它身上连了个开关
And..he was wired up and

762
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:35,450
打开开关它就能高潮
could push a switch and have an orgasm,

763
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,660
然后这个可怜的小家伙
and so, the scientists were

764
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:40,260
让科学家们一顿爆笑
sort of laughing at this pathetic little creature.

765
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:44,510
它不吃不喝 就不停的触摸开关
While it ignores food and water and didn't do anything else.

766
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,300
最后它就这么死了
And eventually it just died.

767
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,480
我觉得这就是
I mean, I think that's the

768
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,850
人类的未来 就像…
future of humanity, you know? Just...

769
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,980
爽到死
and die!

770
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,020
有可能吧
Well, maybe so

771
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,590
每代人都认为
but every generation believes

772
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:00,150
自己见证了世界末日
that they're witnessing the end of the world.

773
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,260
但
But...

774
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,060
看我 不还活得好好的
I feel that I'm actually living it.

775
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,240
好 我问个问题 帕特里克
Ok I have a question for you Patrick.

776
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,940
许多人都这样觉得
I think a lot of people are feeling that way... you know

777
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,180
人们都着迷于享乐
We are like this kind of pleasure-obsessed

778
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,760
腐蚀于性爱 不断追求物质
porn-addled Materialist.

779
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,890
将人性深埋于科技的土壤中
Seeding our humanity to technology

780
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:18,620
而这时 计算机正变得拥有感情
At the same moment that computers are becoming sentient.

781
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,750
对吧 所以我的问题是
Right? So what my question is,

782
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,750
这种自觉到底从何而来
is this notion of 'self' to begin with.

783
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,230
德尔斐阿波罗神庙门前
Well it's written over

784
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,930
刻着这么几个字
the portals of the temple of Apollo at Delhi

785
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:29,300
就是“Γνώθι σ' αυτόν”[希腊语]
it says"Gnothi seauton"

786
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,280
意思是“认识你自己”
Which means "Know thyself"

787
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,750
但现在基本全自动化了
Yes but we are kind of 99% automated already.

788
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:37,340
而性格这种属于自觉的东西
No our personality or this thing we think of as ourselves.

789
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,950
其实只占大脑运作的一小部分
It is only a tiny fraction of what the brain is doing.

790
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,700
身体绝大多数的机能又都是自行运转的
Most of these automated body functions.

791
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,480
那么自觉到底根植于何处呢
So then is what is it we're actually seeding?

792
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,150
这种自觉的概念
Now, if this notion of self

793
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,330
如果只占那么一丁点的话
is such a small percentage of usage

794
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:50,110
为何我总能听到关于它的话题呢
How come I always hear so much about it?

795
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,520
就像我的小鸡鸡
Well it's just like my penis.

796
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,850
不是说它有多大
I mean it's not that big

797
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,040
虽然只是身体的一小部分
it is a small part of myself

798
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,900
但需要很多关照
But it needs a lot of attention.

799
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,460
他的也是
His too!

800
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,640
你们是怎么认识的
And how did you two meet?

801
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,800
你不知道吗
You do not know?

802
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,650
怎么
What?

803
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,150
去读读杰西的书
Well, you have to read Jesse's books.

804
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,670
想知道跟我做爱什么感觉
Yeah, especially if you want to know

805
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,970
就去仔细读读 快去读读
exactly what it is like to have sex with me, read away!

806
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:07,860
赶快去读
Read away!

807
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,360
不好意思 斯特凡诺斯
Excuse me, Stefanos.

808
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:12,340
我意思是那肯定是本好书
I mean it's well written.

809
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,310
对
Yeah

810
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,940
我们十八年前相识
We met about 18 years ago and we kind of,

811
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,950
相互之间有一点感觉
sort of fell in love a little bit.

812
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:21,170
然后 我们失去了联系
and... then we lost track of each other

813
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:23,460
大概十年后 我们又遇见了
And a decade later, we ran into each other.

814
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:26,380
不 不是遇见 小笨熊
No, no, no ... we did not run into each other, sweetie bear

815
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,730
你写的那本书 灵感来自我们相遇
You wrote a book inspired by our meeting...

816
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,950
我读了之后 决定去找他
And I read about it and went to look for him.

817
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,870
好浪漫
That's pretty romantic.

818
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:35,320
没有 没有
Not really, not really, not really.

819
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,540
他没说他结婚了
He neglects to mention that he was married,

820
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,870
- 也没说有了孩子  - 那是细节
- had a kid...  - Details! Details!

821
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,500
想起来真是灾难
Yeah that part was a disaster!

822
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,460
谈不上吧 这没办法避免
It wasn't a disaster, it was inevitable.

823
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,830
第一次没有带套
And the first time that we had sex without a condom.

824
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:48,680
一下生了对双胞胎 我就被拖下水了
Twins! And have been chained to the sink ever since...

825
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,350
很遗憾
Sorry to say that.

826
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,320
没这么糟吧
It's not that bad is it?

827
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,020
你家闺女多漂亮
The girls are so beautiful.

828
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,490
又那么可爱
They are cute.

829
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,820
还是有好的方面 对吧
Ok... no, no, it has some upsides.  Ok.

830
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,770
让我教教你 安娜 怎样抓住男人的心
Let me tell you right now, Anna, how to keep a man

831
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:02,960
玩愚蠢的小游戏时 得处处让着他们
You got to let them win at all the silly little games

832
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,880
- 老天  - 他们喜欢
- Oh God!  - they like...

833
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,020
我们俩认识的第一晚 一起玩弹球
When I met Jessy the first night we were playing pinball.

834
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,010
- 当然是我赢了  - 你听到的
- And of course I was winning.  - What you are hearing is the

835
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:10,460
是我们俩恋爱关系里 最低级的谎言
foundational lie to our entire relationship ...

836
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,800
最后一刻
And at the last minute I let the

837
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,430
- 我让球这样从中间过去  - 不对
- ball go down in the middle.  - It is... It is, no.

838
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,210
- 这才能帮他们建立信心  - 玩什么都行
- It builds their confidence,  - She can't beat me at one game,

839
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,570
- 如果不让他们赢  - 不是所有游戏
- if I didn't let him win it every game,  - not any game...

840
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,380
我们就不能上床
We would never have sex.

841
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,750
我不得不说
I mean... I'm sorry to say

842
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,580
他是隐性大男子主义者
all this but he's actually a closet macho.

843
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,050
就想娶个胸大无脑的老婆
He dreams of having a bimbo for a wife.

844
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,700
- 那是我最大的梦想  - 做梦吧
- It is my greatest aspiration.  - Dreams!

845
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,450
那么
So...

846
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,610
怎么
Yes?

847
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,360
你是个作家吗
So you're a writer?

848
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,180
是呀
Yeah, yeah... sure.

849
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,620
那你写的是书吗
So you write like... books?

850
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,340
我只写了几本
I've written a few, sure.

851
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,980
人家以前从没遇到过作家
Wow... I've never met a writer before.

852
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:59,500
你肯定聪明极了
You must be really smart.

853
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,390
有时人家累了
You know... I can't even

854
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:03,650
甚至连自己的名字也写不好
write my own name sometimes when I'm tired.

855
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,240
你喜欢哪种书呢
What kind of books do you like?

856
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,910
人家喜欢故事里充满了
Well I like stories with a meaning behind it,

857
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,600
美丽的爱情
like a really beautiful love story.

858
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,140
没错
Oh sure yes!

859
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:17,550
我曾读过一本书叫《罗密欧和…
You know... I read this book once... Romeo and...

860
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,980
朱莉叶
Juliet

861
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,590
对呀
Yeah!

862
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,540
你也看过吗
Wow! You know it?

863
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,590
挺棒的 但其实那是出戏剧
It's very good. It's a play, actually.

864
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,510
那不是书 是戏剧
It is not a book, a play.

865
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:29,500
人家以为那本书是电影改编的呢
Oh I thought it was a book based on the movie.

866
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,500
- 不 是戏剧  - 原来是戏剧呀
- No, no, a play  - Ok, it was a play, wow!

867
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,620
其实人家没有读完
Well, actually I did not read the whole thing

868
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,920
因为人家
because sometimes I have to

869
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,760
有读杂志的习惯
keep up and read these magazines

870
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,290
好了解大家都在做什么
To know exactly what's going on in all those peoples' lives.

871
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:46,260
- 这很重要  - 你这么聪明
- Well that is important.  - Ok you are very, very smart.

872
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:50,620
我想你的下面也一定很厉害
And I bet you have a gigantic penis.

873
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:56,080
怎么我就这么爱这个女人
Why am I finding myself so attracted to this woman?!

874
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,920
这是男子主义有趣的一面
And that's the funny part of it.

875
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,520
而糟糕的一面是
The not so funny part of the

876
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:05,500
今天我们去机场送亨利
closet macho, ok, is that today after we drop Henry off,

877
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,420
之后他告诉我
He tells me that

878
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,260
即使我有一份非常理想的工作
even though I have an offer for an amazing job,

879
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,920
他还是想我放弃并跟他去芝加哥
He wants me to throw it away and move to Chicago.

880
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,690
我没这么说
That's not what I said,

881
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,620
- 我说我很想他  - 没错 这样我们
- I said I missed him.  - Yes, so we can babysit

882
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,290
- 你可以  - 每隔一周都可替他的前妻
- You were expressing something  - every other weekend for

883
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,350
- 表达你的观点 我也一样  - 照顾孩子
- you felt conflicted about and I did the same.  - his ex-wife.

884
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,230
我以为我已经融入你的生活
I thought I was in a relationship.

885
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,160
你们停一停 今天跟亨利道别
Hey, you guys stop it, It must have

886
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,600
很不容易 对吧
been so hard to saying goodbye to Henry today, right?

887
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,710
- 没错  - 我想他也是个很聪明的小家伙
- Yeah, of course.  - And I mean he is such an amazing kid.

888
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:25,800
我还想和他成为搭档一起下棋
Yeah... I'll rate him as my chess partner

889
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,200
等到斯特凡诺斯和我分手
When Stefanos and I split up,

890
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,330
我要申请唯一监护权
I am getting full custody

891
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,810
这一时半会到不成问题
Well that's okay for a while

892
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,550
因为我和我二十岁的女友
because me and my 20-year-old girlfriend

893
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,140
还有得折腾呢
will be a little bit preoccupied.

894
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,780
- 我爱男人  - 我爱你
- Oh I love man.  - And I love you.

895
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:45,770
我讲个我老公喜欢的故事
Ok... I have a story that my husband here loves.

896
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:48,750
这个故事讲述了
And that's gonna tell you everything about

897
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,450
男性与女性不同的特质
masculine and feminine, right?

898
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:51,840
准备好了吗
Ok, ready?

899
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:55,110
我妈妈曾经是名护士
My mom used to be a nurse so she

900
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:58,060
当病人从昏迷中醒来 她总是陪在旁边
was there when people were coming out of the coma.

901
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:01,030
认真听 这故事很有趣
Listen, it's an interesting story.

902
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:05,870
- 我在听  - 并且告诉病人
- I'm listening.  - So she was the one to tell them...

903
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:10,830
我的名字叫凯瑟琳娜 你刚从昏迷中醒来
Hi... My name is Catherina you're coming out of a coma.

904
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:13,910
你遇到了严重的交通事故
You've been in a really bad automobile accident.

905
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:17,410
你会好起来的
You're gonna be okay.

906
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,920
你会没事的 这样之类的话
You're gonne be fine and, you know, stuff like that

907
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,150
她说 每个女人醒来的第一件事
She said  that every woman

908
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:26,760
第一件 第一反应就是
the very first thing, the first reaction she would have

909
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,640
问身边的人
Would be to ask to ask about everyone else:

910
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,230
我的孩子有事吗
how are my kids?

911
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:33,800
我的丈夫有事吗 有其他人受伤吗
How is my husband? Is anyone else hurt?

912
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,090
而男人们 无一例外
Every man with no exception, when they

913
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:41,770
当他们被这样告知 第一反应是什么呢
were told all this, what was the first thing they did?

914
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,290
低头看看自己老二
Looked down on their cock.

915
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,920
得先确定它还在那里
You know what? You got to make sure it's still there.

916
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,230
它还好用吧
You got to make sure it's still working.

917
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,100
- 必须的  - 还能一柱擎天
- You have to!  - Alive and kicking!

918
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,520
最后
Yeah, yeah, and eventually

919
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:59,060
他们回过神来 才想起问问他们的孩子
they come around to asking about their kids

920
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,100
或其他人
or about someone else that might

921
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,770
有没有受伤 这样
have accidentally been killed, and stuff like that.

922
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:06,210
不是有句话吗 叫老二的事最重要
Does not say it all? Penis first and the rest of the world.

923
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:10,090
老二 老二
Penis! Penis!

924
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:13,080
你们能从纯粹的性别角度解释
But if you can explain it on strictly gender terms

925
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,300
你们为什么 或者说为什么女人要浪费时间
why do you, or why does any woman waste time

926
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,650
不厌其烦的尝试改变一个男人呢
getting mad at or bother to trying to change a man?

927
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:21,270
没错 这是生物学 到底是什么问题呢
Exactly! It's all biology. What is the problem?

928
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:24,060
你太会转移话题了
And you are so, so good at turnings things around ...

929
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,200
- 不 我只是想说  - 他是个天才
- NO... I'm just trying to say that.  - He is a genius.

930
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,620
这就叫鸡蛋里面挑骨头
it's like getting pissed at frog for being green.

931
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,350
- 没错  - 听了这么久
- Yes! Exactly!  - Hearing all this,

932
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:33,450
我就想 天长地久相爱
I wonder if this idea of a love

933
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,650
这种事还和我们有关吗
affair that lasts forever is still relevant to us?

934
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:38,230
都知道
I mean we know that we are

935
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,390
我们最终会分开
going to break up eventually.

936
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,350
毫无疑问
Definitely.

937
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:43,970
- 你的父母还在一起吗  - 没有
- Are your parents are still together?  - No way.

938
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,220
没有 那你的呢
No and what about yours?

939
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,510
在一起 但他们可以离婚
They are, but they could divorced.

940
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,220
他们有钱的话
I think if they had more money,

941
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,740
估计早就离了
they would not still be together.

942
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,760
老天 你们都太实际了
God, you guys are so practical,

943
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,380
我真是生错了年代
I was born into the wrong generation.

944
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,360
我曾祖母
My grandmother's mother

945
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,980
在她临终前
wrote to our whole family

946
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:03,050
留下了二十六页的长信
a 26-page letter from her deathbed

947
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:04,740
她花了三页去说
and she spent three pages

948
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,900
她为一部戏设计的服装
on the costume she did for a play...

949
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,680
而仅用一段来说她的丈夫
and only one paragraph on her husband.

950
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,800
她也是演员吗
Was she an actress too?

951
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,850
不 她是个
No... she was...a...

952
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,400
英语“女裁缝”怎么说
Comment on dit " couturière "?

953
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,800
女裁缝
Seamstress.

954
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,360
她有很多
And she had all these

955
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:22,190
不错的朋友 而关于我曾祖父
wonderful friends and about my great-grandfather

956
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,010
她仅提到三件事
She mentioned three events:

957
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:26,730
他去参战 因为他的工作搬家
He went to war, we moved because of his job

958
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:28,030
他死了
And he died.

959
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,140
她的忠告是
Her big advice was

960
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,740
不要在浪漫的爱情上消耗太多
not to be too consumed with romantic love

961
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:36,010
友谊和工作
Friendships and work, she said,

962
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:38,070
才给我带来真正的快乐
brought to her the most happiness.

963
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:39,700
我再同意不过了
I could not agree more,

964
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,280
我们就是被这样教育长大的 对吧
I mean that's the thing that fucks us up right?

965
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,780
只有这种精神伴侣
This idea of a soul mate of someone

966
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,620
才能让我们变得完整
who would come to complete us

967
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:49,890
帮助我们承担生活中的问题
and save us from having to take care of ourselves.

968
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:53,640
对于斯特凡诺斯 我将标准降得非常低
With Stefanos, I set the bar extremely low

969
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,210
我知道他做不到我的要求
I know he is not gonna meet any of my needs

970
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:57,260
太难了
Definitely not.

971
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:00,330
那你的祖母呢 她是你的精神伴侣吗
So what about Grandma? Was she your soul mate?

972
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:02,110
说得好听 不过
Sounds appealing but actually

973
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,490
你祖母其实更加理性一些
your grandmother was more rational than that.

974
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:07,750
她很独立 也这样要求我
She took cared of herself and asked me to do the same.

975
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,660
让我们有足够的空间 协商一致
With plenty of room to meet in the middle.

976
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,170
听起来很理想
Yeah, that sounds ideal

977
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:12,870
那确实很理想
That's is, actually.

978
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:15,690
很显然 我妻子今天不在这
But it must be obvious that my wife is not here today.

979
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:17,310
我们从来不是一个人
We were never one person,

980
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:20,040
是两个独立的人 我们也很喜欢这样
always two, we preferred it that way.

981
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,780
真是美丽的故事
That is so beautiful.

982
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,270
我认为我的丈夫
I think my husband is

983
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:26,960
总是想吞并我
always trying to almost colonize me, you know

984
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,820
我吞并你吗
I colonize you?

985
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:32,630
是的 但我也在吞并你 亲爱的
Yes but I colonize you, too, darling.

986
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:34,140
好吧
Well ... Ok.

987
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,130
但在最后的时日
But at the end of the day

988
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:37,900
你会发现
It's not the love of one

989
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,750
你不是爱着一个人 而是爱着这种生活
other person that matters it's the love of life.

990
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:41,810
那太好了 帕特里克
That's good to know, Patrick,

991
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:43,690
因为生活我能自己掌控
because life I can handle.

992
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:45,570
而阿里阿德涅
Ariadni, on the other hand,

993
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:47,720
我们都知道希腊出悲剧 对吧
We all know that the Greeks invented tragedy, right?

994
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:48,780
而且她还来自玛尼
and on top of that it stems

995
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:53,460
狂躁这个词就来源于此地
from the original Mani, which is short for Mania.

996
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:01,000
对了 如果今晚我们去不了旅馆
Hey, guys if we can not make that hotel

997
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,850
你们能退掉它或你们自己去住吗
room tonight could you get a refund or use it yourself?

998
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,430
不 我们退不了款
No... we do not get a refund.

999
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:07,520
你们不想住吗
Are you trying to get out of it?

1000
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,400
不是 这份礼物太棒了
No, it's such a great gift you've given us.

1001
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,050
但还要打行李
But I'm so stressed getting.

1002
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:13,320
还有女孩们 压力太大
all the packing ready, with the girls...

1003
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,220
- 不 不  - 这样吧
- No, no...  - We made a deal guys.

1004
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,490
我们帮你看孩子 你们好好享受
We will watch the kids, you're gonna love it.

1005
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:20,290
- 慢慢走去旅馆  - 会非常棒的
- It's a fantastic walk to  - It's really really good.

1006
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,570
- 那感觉非常美妙 你们不会后悔的  - 没错
- the hotel You won't regret it.  - It is.

1007
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:25,160
不去的话 我们可是会生气的
And we would be very offended if you don't go.

1008
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:26,180
好吧
Ok...

1009
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:27,450
谢谢你们
Thank you.

1010
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:32,210
当我想起我的丈夫
Well... when I think of my husband,

1011
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:34,120
我非常想念
what I miss the most about him

1012
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:38,550
夜晚他躺在我身边的感觉
is the way he used to lie down next to me at night.

1013
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:42,750
有时他会把胳膊横在我的胸前
Sometimes his arm would stretch along my chest,

1014
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,730
我动不了 甚至要憋住呼吸
and I could not move, I... I even held my breath.

1015
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:51,090
但我感到 安心
But I felt safe

1016
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,810
完整
Complete.

1017
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:55,470
我也想念
And... I miss the way

1018
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:58,810
他走在街上吹着口哨的样子
he was whistling walking down the street.

1019
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:02,400
每次做什么我都会想他怎么做
And every time I do something I think of what he would say,

1020
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,200
天冷了 要披上围巾
when it's cold today, wear a scarf.

1021
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:11,940
但是之后 我渐渐忘却细节
But lately I've been forgetting little things.

1022
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:16,940
记忆在不断褪色 我开始忘记他
It's sort of fading and I'm starting to forget him.

1023
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,710
这就像
And it's like ...

1024
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,300
我又失去了他
like losing him again.

1025
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:26,240
所以有时 我努力回想
So sometimes I make myself remember

1026
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,740
他脸庞的每一处
every detail of his face.

1027
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:32,910
眼睛的颜色 唇齿的样子
The exact color of his eyes, his lips, his teeth,

1028
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:36,550
他的皮肤和头发的触感
the texture of his skin, his hair.

1029
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:40,310
这一切记忆都随着时间流走了
That was all gone by the time he went.

1030
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:44,550
但有时 偶尔 只是偶尔
And sometimes... not always, but sometimes,

1031
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:46,850
我能非常清楚的看到他
I can actually see him.

1032
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,650
就好像拨开云雾 他就在那里
It's as if a cloud moves away and there he is.

1033
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:51,620
我几乎能碰到他
And I could almost touch him.

1034
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:55,760
突然 真实回到了眼前
But then... the real world rushes in.

1035
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,210
他再次消失了
And he vanishes again.

1036
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:01,250
曾几何时 每天早晨
For a while, I did this every morning,

1037
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:03,940
天刚亮的时候 我都会看到他
when the sun was not too bright outside.

1038
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:07,540
可不知为何 他又会消失在阳光下
But the sun somehow makes him vanish.

1039
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,770
他出现又消失
And he appears and he disappears,

1040
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:14,900
像日出和日落
like a sunrise and a sunset.

1041
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,160
一切都那么短暂
Anything, so ephemeral.

1042
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,940
正如我们的生活
It's just like our life.

1043
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:26,130
我们出现又消失
We appear and we disappear.

1044
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:29,010
我们对有些人来说很重要
And we are so important to some,

1045
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:33,830
可我们又只是擦肩而过
but we are just... passing through.

1046
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,800
敬 擦肩而过
To "passing through"

1047
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,340
敬 擦肩而过
To "Passing through"

1048
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:55,650
终于 他在窗户的倒映下看清了自己的脸
And eventually he catches his face in the window's reflection

1049
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,960
他意识到自己已不再是那个9岁的小男孩了
And he realizes he's no longer a 9 year old boy.

1050
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,890
对吧 他突然之间变老了 有了胡子
Right? He's suddenly old, he's got a beard

1051
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:02,880
- 眼睛里水雾缭绕  - 确实让人难过
- and his eyes are watery  - This one seems sad

1052
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,590
开始我还以为你要给我讲故事
At first I thought you were going to tell me a story

1053
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:06,450
就是关于一个人臆想出一个朋友的那个
about a guy that has an imaginary friend

1054
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:07,720
哪个
Which one?

1055
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:10,430
他五十多岁的时候 那个虚拟朋友又出现了
When in his 50s, the imaginary  friend shows up again.

1056
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:11,490
和一只蜂鸟一起
With the hummingbird?

1057
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,350
- 没错 就是这个  - 你喜欢吗
- Yes, that!  - You liked that one?

1058
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:14,480
很有趣
It's funny.

1059
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,270
还记得你让我看过的那封信吗
Remember that letter

1060
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:18,420
你二十岁时写给
that you let me read that you wrote

1061
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,510
四十岁的自己的那封信
when you were 20 to yourself at 40.

1062
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:21,670
当然 我还记得第一句话
Yes, I remember the first sentence:

1063
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,270
亲爱的四十岁的杰西 但愿你没有离婚
Dear 40-year-old Jesse, I hope you're not divorced

1064
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,810
我不记得有这部分了
No I did not even remember that part,

1065
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:28,150
我是想说那封信里还提到别的事情
I meant to all the other things in that letter

1066
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:31,590
你还是那个你 我们总觉得自己会成长
You're the same guy, I mean, we always think that we are evolving

1067
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,640
可我们并无力改变多少
But we can not change that much

1068
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,750
- 你知道我是怎样看待我的变化的  - 怎样
- You know how I think I've changed the most.  - How?

1069
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:38,550
我年轻的时候总希望时间可以过得快一点
When I was younger I just wanted time to speed up.

1070
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:39,390
为什么
Why?

1071
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,240
因为那样 我就可以做我自己
So I can be on my own, so I can be free from my parents

1072
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,470
摆脱掉家长和学校的一切束缚
and school and all that shit, you know,

1073
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:46,810
我希望自己闭上眼 一睁眼就变成了成年人
I just wanted to close my eyes and wake up and be an adult

1074
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:48,290
现在一切都如我所愿成为现实
And now I can feel that that happened

1075
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:50,240
我却希望时间能停下来
and I want everything to slow down.

1076
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:51,640
很奇怪 在我的一生当中
It's strange I've always had

1077
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,060
这种感觉始终挥之不去
this feeling no matter where I am in my life.

1078
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,090
既像是真实存在 又仿佛南柯一梦
That it's either a memory or a dream.

1079
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:58,050
我知道你一直有这种感觉
I know you've always thought that.

1080
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,510
我也是 就好像 这真的是我的人生吗
Me too, it's like is this really my life?

1081
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,350
现在这一切都正在发生吗
Like is it happening, right now?

1082
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:04,390
- 就是这样  - 我知道
- It is.  - I know!

1083
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:06,460
每一年 我都会感受到
Every year I just seem to get

1084
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:07,960
更大的压力和打击
a little bit more humbled and more overwhelmed

1085
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,540
那些事情我从来搞不明白
about all things I'm never gonna know or understand

1086
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:11,500
这就是我一直在告诫你的
That's what I keep telling you:

1087
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:12,220
你一无所知
You know nothing.

1088
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:14,550
我知道 我已经醒悟了
I know, I know! I'm coming around!

1089
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,500
其实 一无所知并没有你想象的那么糟糕
But not knowing is not so bad.

1090
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,730
我是说
I mean...

1091
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,960
关键是要不断发现 寻找
The point is to be looking, searching,

1092
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:22,110
保持如饥似渴的状态
to stay hungry, right?

1093
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:24,560
没错 我只是希望能变得简单一点
That's true... I just wish it was a little easier.

1094
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,000
什么意思
How do you mean?

1095
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:29,160
你知道的 就是保持一定的热情
Just to maintain a certain level of passion, you know.

1096
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,570
所有的一切都那么顺理成章
I mean, it used to come so naturally.

1097
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,580
记得我年轻的时候 我的一群作家朋友们
Remember when I was younger, me and all my writer friends.

1098
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:37,430
我们可以感觉到自己在做的是重要的事情
We like.. we just felt like were doing something important.

1099
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:39,100
你知道吗 就好像是属于我们的时代
You know? Like this was our time.

1100
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,930
可他们都是些骄傲自大的小子 对吗
But they were all a bunch of arrogant little pricks, right?

1101
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:44,210
不 好吧 也许吧 我也不知道
No! Alright, maybe... I dunno...

1102
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:45,910
我们长大后就渐渐失去了
we just grew out of all this energy,

1103
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,820
当初的热情 创造力和雄心壮志
all this creativity or whatever ambitions people had.

1104
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:54,050
我觉得人还是应该年少轻狂些才好
I think you gotta be a little deluded to stay motivated.

1105
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:57,180
年轻人都是这样 不停地把自己和别人比较
Young men have this thing about comparing themselves all the time.

1106
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,680
他们有很多自我评判的准绳
They have all these signposts they judge themselves by.

1107
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,780
你以前也是这样
You used to do that all the time!

1108
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:02,810
我怎么了 你什么意思
Do what? What do you mean?

1109
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:05,700
像巴尔扎克十七岁创作出这部作品
It's like Balzac wrote this by 17,

1110
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,990
而斯科特 ·菲茨杰拉德三十岁才写出来
F. Scott Fitzgerald did this by 30.

1111
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:09,460
巴尔扎克每天早餐前创作一部作品
And Balzac wrote a book before breakfast everyday.

1112
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,380
是的 可是女人们并不这么想
Yeah, but women do not think that way as much.

1113
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,550
你这么认为吗
You don't think so?

1114
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:16,070
我们只是没什么可比的罢了
We have much less to compare ourselves to, maybe.

1115
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:18,680
大多数有所成就的女人
Most women who achieve anything in life.

1116
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,850
在你第一次听说她们时 都已经五十多岁了
the first time you hear about them, they're in their 50s.

1117
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:21,770
因为在这以前 对女人来说
because it is was so hard

1118
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:24,180
想要得到一定的社会地位实在是太难了
for them to get any recognitions before then.

1119
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:25,830
她们要么苦苦奋斗了三十年
They struggled for 30 years

1120
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:28,630
要么就是在能做自己想做的事之前
or they raised kids and were stranded at home

1121
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,810
都被困在家里 相夫教子
before they could do what they want.

1122
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:34,440
你知道吗 这其实也算是一种解放
Actually you know what? It's kind of freeing.

1123
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,710
我们不用每天忙着去和马丁·路德·金
We don't have to spend our lives

1124
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:39,910
圣雄甘地 托尔斯泰这些人去比较
comparing ourselves to Martin Luther King, Ghandi, Tolstoy.

1125
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,220
那圣女贞德呢
What about Joan of Arc?

1126
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:44,400
我是说 她一个小姑娘却拯救了法国
I mean... she was a teenager and she saved France.

1127
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,450
谁愿意做圣女贞德 忘记法国吧
Who wants to be Joan of Arc? Forget France.

1128
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:50,250
她被绑在火刑柱上活活烧死 还是处女呢
She was burned at the stake, and a virgin!

1129
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:53,810
我可不想这样 好吗 多伟大的情操
Ok? Nothing I aspire to. What a great achievement!

1130
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,490
- 天哪  - 怎么了  - 没什么
- Oh God...  - What?  - No, nothing.

1131
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,600
- 怎么了  - 这太奇怪了
- What?  - This is so weird.

1132
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:08,890
- 什么意思  - 就像这样 我们边走边聊
- What do you mean?  - Just this, us walking, having a conversation.

1133
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:12,090
讨论一切和饮食工作无关的话题
About something else than scheduling food, work.

1134
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:12,890
自从为一些鸡毛蒜皮的事劳心后
I mean how long has it been

1135
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:15,180
我们确实很久没有像现在这样了
since we were wondering around bullshiting

1136
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,120
我听到了什么 你能听到吗
Do you hear what I hear?

1137
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:21,150
- 大海的声音吗  - 不
- The sea?  - No.

1138
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:24,200
什么 我知道了 没琐事牵绊的声音
What? Oh! No small feat.

1139
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:27,630
没有什么被推翻 没有什么需要清理
Nothing being knocked over, nothing we have clean up.

1140
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:29,860
也没有什么不公正的事情发生
Nothing injustices being done.

1141
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,170
对啊 上一次是什么时候呢
Yeah, so when was the last time?

1142
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:35,000
当我们无处可去的时候
When we had nowhere to be?

1143
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,290
是啊 还记得我们在卢森堡公园吗
Yeah. Remember walking around the Luxembourg Gardens?

1144
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:41,810
我在混凝土乒乓球桌上把你打得落花流水
I used to kick your ass in ping-pong on those concrete tables

1145
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:44,850
恭喜你 竟然打赢了个怀着双胞胎的孕妇
Congrats! You beat a woman pregnant with twins!

1146
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:45,730
真够男人的
Such a gentleman.

1147
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:47,920
这总比输给一个怀着双胞胎的孕妇要好
It is better than losing to a pregnant woman with twins!

1148
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:49,080
没错 天哪
Yes... O God!

1149
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:51,200
你知道我在想什么吗 我在想
You know what I think? I think

1150
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,670
从我们离开父母的那一刻起
it's from the time we leave our parents' house,

1151
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:56,630
直到我们有了孩子
until we have kids, that's the only time

1152
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:58,780
只有那时 你的生活是完全属于你自己的
that your life is completely your own.

1153
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:01,530
那种日子大概过了十年 真的很好
I think I had about a decade of that, it was great, it was like,

1154
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:04,510
就像是一次漫长的流浪 每一天
just like one long flowing, a day,

1155
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:06,840
一星期 一年 都没有太大的区别
a week, a year, there wasn't much difference

1156
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,030
不是 我过去总是把时间
No... I know, I used to keep track of time

1157
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:11,810
花在工作和男朋友们的身上
through jobs and boyfriends and stuff like that.

1158
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:12,710
现在我却可以说出
Now I can tell you

1159
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:15,170
在过去的七年中
every detail of the past seven years

1160
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,040
孩子们身上发生过的每一件小事
based on what was happening in the girls' lives

1161
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,400
好吧 没错
Yeah...right... totally.

1162
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,330
- 你也是吗  - 是的
- You do that too?  - Yes,

1163
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:23,600
我是说 如果真的把时间划分开
if, I mean, time is demarcated now

1164
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:26,970
不 真不敢相信 你竟然也记得
No, I'm just surprised you do that too

1165
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:29,350
好吧 来个小测验
Ok... quick test

1166
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:31,390
二〇〇九年八月
August 2009.

1167
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:35,230
来吧 考考你 那时发生了什么
No, come on! It's a quick one. What was happening?

1168
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:38,860
二〇〇九年八月 我们在和你父母度假
August 2009, we were on vacation with your parents.

1169
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:41,790
妮娜先起了水痘 紧接着就是艾拉
Nina got the chickenpox first and quickly followed by Ella

1170
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:45,310
- 真没想到  - 可以奖励我一颗五角星了吗
- I am so impressed.  - So do I get a gold star?

1171
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:46,800
可以考虑
Maybe.

1172
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,940
- 我能问你一个问题吗  - 当然了
- Hey... can I ask you a question?  - Sure.

1173
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:53,360
如果我们今天第一次在火车上邂逅
If we were meeting for the first time today on a train,

1174
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,420
你会被我吸引吗
would you find me attractive?

1175
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,630
- 当然了  - 不 我是说我现在这个样子
- Of course.  - No, but really right now as I am

1176
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,140
你会开始和我搭讪吗
Would you start talking to me?

1177
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,430
你会邀请我和你一起下火车吗
Would you ask me to get off the train with you?

1178
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:08,060
你的这些问题都是些假设
I mean you're asking a theoretical question.

1179
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:10,040
我只想知道我的人生会是怎样
I mean what would my life-situation be?

1180
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:11,720
从理论上来讲 它不会欺骗你吗
Technically, it would not be cheating on you?

1181
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,430
- 你为什么不直接说会被我吸引  - 我说了
- Ok, why can not you just say yes?  - I did, I said, of course.

1182
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:16,740
我只是想来点浪漫的 可是全被你破坏了
I wanted to say something romantic and you blew it, ok?

1183
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,200
好吧 如果我在火车上看到你
Ok, ok... if I saw you on a train

1184
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,060
听着 我的眼神会被你吸引
Ok, listen, I would lock eyes with you ..

1185
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:23,960
之后 我会慢慢向你走来 对你说
and then I would walk right up to you and say

1186
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,700
宝贝 你让我变成了
Hey baby, you are making me

1187
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:28,260
一只在情欲里挣扎的山羊
as horny as a billy goat in a pepper patch.

1188
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,600
住口 你太恶心了
Stop! That's disgusting!

1189
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:35,960
不 事实上是你没有通过测试
No! The truth is that you failed the test and the fact is

1190
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,520
而且你也不会在火车上和我搭讪
that you would not pick me up on the train.

1191
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,820
你甚至都不会看我一眼
You would not even notice me,

1192
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:41,200
一个肥臀还脱发的中年母亲
a fat-ass, middle-aged mom losing her hair

1193
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,400
好了
Ok...

1194
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:47,620
- 是啊 那才是我  - 这都是你逼我的
- Yes, that's me.  - You set me up to fail.

1195
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,290
- 你逼的  - 对 对 没错
- You did.  - Ok, true.

1196
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:54,530
可在现实世界里 小秃 那一天
But in the real world, baldy, Ok, on game day, when it mattered,

1197
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:57,050
我确实在火车上和你搭讪了
I did, talk to you on the train,

1198
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:58,770
我确实那样做了 那是我做过的最正确的事
I did that and it was the best thing I ever did.

1199
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:01,810
是吗 看看那些山羊 你们好啊
Really? Look at the goats. Hello!

1200
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:07,800
你知道 这可不是个好问题
You know that is not even a good question.

1201
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:12,400
真正的问题是如果我邀请你和我一起下车
The real question would be if I did ask you to get off the train.

1202
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,480
- 是啊  - 你会和我下车吗
- Yeah...  - Would you get off with me?

1203
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,010
不 当然不会了 还有人在等我呢
No, of course not, I have people waiting for me.

1204
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:21,960
你知道的 一只四十一岁还在发情的雄性山羊
You know, and a 41-year-old horny billy goat

1205
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,870
太吓人了 我能起一身鸡皮疙瘩 救命啊
How creepy! I'm creeped out right now. Help!

1206
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:25,750
救命啊[希腊语]
Βοήθεια

1207
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:27,820
真不敢相信 我都四十一了
I can not believe I'm 41.

1208
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:30,440
我也不敢相信 你竟然都这么老了
Yeah, me neither. You've gotten so old.

1209
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,270
我没想过自己会和一个四十多岁的人睡在一起
Never thought I would ever sleep with anyone over 40

1210
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:33,050
是啊
Yeah...

1211
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:33,920
你知道吗
Actually you know what?

1212
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,660
你是和我睡过的人当中年纪最大的一个
You are the oldest guy I've ever slept with.

1213
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:36,990
- 这样啊  - 是真的
- That is something  - That's true.

1214
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:39,450
我知道 不过我可不是你拒绝的最老的家伙
I know, but I'm not the oldest guy you've ever blown

1215
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:43,160
- 什么  - 那次在华沙的会议
- What!  - That conference in Warsaw.

1216
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,420
- 什么会议  - 瓦文萨
- What conference?  - Lech Walesa.

1217
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:50,220
瓦文萨 你在说什么呢
Lech Walesa! Oh what are you talking about?

1218
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,090
没关系 那都是我们在一起以前的事了
It's ok, it was before we're together

1219
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:56,200
没什么不敢承认的 我还记得你提起过他
You can admit it. I can remember the way you talked about him.

1220
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,940
他是如何让你打开心扉
How he opened your heart,

1221
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,220
你明确地拒绝了他
you definitely blew him.

1222
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,740
好吧 你真是疯了
Ok... you're really crazy!

1223
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,120
那是戈尔巴乔夫
That was Gorbachev.

1224
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:05,530
好吧 你这个地理不通
Ok? Geographically challenged,

1225
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:08,120
痴迷橄榄球又爱吃甜甜圈的美国佬
football-obsessed, doughnut-loving American.

1226
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:08,910
那是戈尔巴乔夫
That was Gorbachev.

1227
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:11,320
不好意思 我总搞不清东方国家的这些领袖
I'm sorry I got Eastern-bloc leaders mixed up, OK.

1228
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,260
我没有拒绝他 好吗 收回你的话
And I did not blow him, ok? Take it back!

1229
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,460
好吧 好吧
Ok, ok.

1230
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,710
天哪
God!

1231
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:20,110
所以那是戈尔巴乔夫
So was it Gorbachev?

1232
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:21,930
好吧 你知道的
All right, you know.

1233
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:25,800
听着 我本来打算一会儿再跟你说
Listen to this... I was going to wait

1234
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:29,920
可我这个人就是藏不住话
to tell you this till later, but I'm so bad with secrets.

1235
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:30,220
怎么
What?

1236
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:32,130
你脑子里长了肿瘤 快死了吗
You've got a tumor in your brain and you are going to die?

1237
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:33,240
不 不是
No, no.

1238
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,690
不是这些 好吗
Nothing like that, alright?

1239
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:37,080
好吧 其实也有点像
Well, actually, it's kind of like that.

1240
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,350
- 我祖母死了  - 不是吧 什么时候的事
- My grandmother died.  - What! When?

1241
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:43,000
是的 我们吃饭前我爸爸发短信告诉我的
Yes, my dad texted to me right before we ate.

1242
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,340
对不起 你怎么不早说
Oh I'm so sorry. Why didn't you tell me?!

1243
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:46,930
像每个人都希望的那样
Everyone has been expecting it.

1244
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:48,830
她活得够长了 而且一生幸福
she has lived a long time, had a great life.

1245
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:50,590
她九十六岁了
She was 96.

1246
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:53,340
你祖父死后没多久 她就去世了
She did not live much longer after your grandfather died.

1247
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,150
不 有一年了
No... barely a year...

1248
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:58,870
有趣的是 这女人还是个奇怪的圣人
The funny thing is that this woman was a freaking saint, ok?

1249
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:02,140
战争时期 她做过护士 照顾我们所有人
She was a nurse in the war. She took care of all of us.

1250
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:05,540
她从来没有说过别人一句坏话
You know... she never said any unkind word about anybody.

1251
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,290
- 真希望我能遇到她  - 没关系的
- I wish I had met her.  - It's OK.

1252
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:09,480
好吧 因为到后来
Okay, because by the end, you know,

1253
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,380
她不想再认识任何人了
she just was not really into meeting new people.

1254
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:14,710
一辈子都在笑面以对
I mean after a lifetime of being sweet as a pie,

1255
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:18,090
自从祖父死后 她受到了很大的打击
once grandpa died, she got kind of awry.

1256
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:20,270
是吗 那时她还在服丧吧
Really? It happens, she was in mourning, no?

1257
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:23,800
没错 我父亲说她一直在等死
Yeah, well, my dad said she was just waiting to die.

1258
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:26,050
他们结婚多久了
How long were they married?

1259
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,720
七十四年了
74 years.

1260
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:31,740
靠 怎么可能
Fuck! How is that even possible?

1261
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,470
要是我们也一起生活七十四年 那得多老啊
How old will we be if we were together for 74 years?

1262
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:38,850
那我们要从什么时候开始算起
Hm, when do we start counting from?

1263
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:41,910
我想应该从我们第一次发生关系时算起吧
I guess from the first time we had sex.

1264
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:43,010
好吧
Ok...

1265
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:46,030
那应该是一九九四年
OK, so... 1994.

1266
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:52,280
好吧 一九九四年 那还有五十六年
Ok... 1994... 56 years from now.

1267
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,560
那时我们都九十八岁了
We will be 98.

1268
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,700
天哪 你还能
Oh! Would you be able to

1269
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,590
再忍受我整整五十六年吗
put up with me for another 56 more years?

1270
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:01,090
我得搞清楚 我不知道自己
I need to know. I do not know

1271
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:03,350
是不是还能忍你那么长时间
if I'm gonna be able to put up with you.

1272
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:05,900
你想想他们见证的那些变化 真不可思议
It's crazy if you think about all the change they saw.

1273
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,830
当他们见到彼此已经没有了最初的感觉
I mean, when they met, neither one of them had electricity.

1274
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:11,570
他过去常常骑马带她上学
He used to take her to school on his horse.

1275
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:15,250
毕业时他们两个分别是致辞的学生代表
When he graduated, he was valedictorian and she was salutatorian.

1276
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:18,790
- 什么意思  - 祖父第一名 祖母第二名
- What is that?  - He was top of the class and she was second.

1277
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,830
我敢说一定是祖母故意放水
I bet she knowingly got a couple of answers wrong,

1278
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:22,410
你祖父才会轻松拿到第一
so that he did not feel threatened.

1279
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:24,750
如果她想轻松一点 这就是最好的办法
Well, if she wanted to get laid, she'd better have.

1280
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,050
没错 你知道 有人就是这么做的
Yes, obviously like you know who.

1281
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,660
不管怎么说 在收到短信之后
Anyway, so I called my dad, right,

1282
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:30,490
我告诉我爸爸
after I got the text, just, you know,

1283
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,090
我很遗憾
to tell him I was sorry,

1284
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:35,030
我想我可能说错了一些话
I think I got screwed up at some point said...

1285
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:38,900
爸爸 你现在是孤儿了 我觉得这不好笑
Hey, dad, you're an orphan now, I don't think it was funny.

1286
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,050
- 一点都不好笑  - 好吧 好像是不好笑
- Not funny at all  - Yeah, I guess not.

1287
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,550
- 下一个是他 之后就是你  - 我知道
- He's next, then you.  - I know.

1288
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:46,080
他告诉我说 我的祖父母
Well... he told me that my grandparents

1289
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,830
想要死后葬在一起
wanted to have a joint service.

1290
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:51,580
他们希望两人的骨灰能埋在一起
They wanted to have their ashes intermingled and be buried as one.

1291
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:52,990
你祖父没有办葬礼吗
Your grandfather didn't have a funeral?

1292
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:54,400
他们彼此立誓
They vowed to each other

1293
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,990
绝不去参加对方的葬礼
they'd never have to attend one another's funeral.

1294
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:59,850
好吧 我更希望你能参加我的葬礼
Oh yeah... I kind of like the idea of you attending mine.

1295
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:04,590
- 什么  - 不是 我是说 我在想象
- What?  - No, I know... I'm imagining you in a suit,

1296
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:06,160
你穿上正装 刮干净胡子的样子
clean-shaven for once,

1297
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,340
挽着女儿们的手 我不知道 我就是喜欢
holding hands with the girls, I don't know, I like it.

1298
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:10,640
- 你会活得比我长的  - 到时候就知道了
- You're gonna outlive me.  - We'll see.

1299
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,790
我想我们俩只有一个人能看到那一天
I guess one of us will see.

1300
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:16,320
你觉得我们也葬在一起怎么样
What do you think you're gonna go to the service with me?

1301
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:20,040
- 去德克萨斯吗  - 反正不在巴黎
- To Texas?  - It's not gonna be in Paris.

1302
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,210
你有多想把我葬在那儿
Ok, how bad you want me there?

1303
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:25,280
其实我很愿意去 只不过机票太贵了
I mean I would come but it's really expensive with the flights.

1304
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,740
其实一个人去会容易很多
Truth is it would be simpler to go alone.

1305
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:29,220
你好
Oh, hello!

1306
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,440
如果我不在那儿
Well, you know and if I'm not there,

1307
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,090
你和你表姐就可以发生点什么了
it will be easier for you to fuck your cousins.

1308
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:36,650
- 没错  - 你们那儿这种事很常见吧
- Yes, that's true.  - Isn't that common where you come from?

1309
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,720
- 你还没回答我的问题  - 什么问题
- You didn't answer the question.  - What question?

1310
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,840
好吧 你还能再忍受我五十六年吗
Well... will you be able to put up with me for 56 more years?

1311
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:47,570
- 我也想知道  - 你又来了
- I'm looking forward to it.  - Shit, you're really working it.

1312
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:51,800
你性爱时的甘露就如同陈年美酒
The nectar of your sex ages like a fine wine.

1313
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:54,710
我长毛的西班牙小伙又变身希腊人了
O-o, my hairy Spanish lover is back Greek,

1314
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:57,080
我现在是希腊人
I'm Greek now.

1315
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,900
看看这个
Look at this!

1316
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:01,330
这地方让我想起了
Wow, this place reminds me

1317
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:03,810
我小时候看过的一部电影
a bit of a movie I saw when I was a teenager.

1318
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:06,940
那是一部五十年代的黑白片
It was a black and white film from the 50s.

1319
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:09,740
我记得 有一对夫妇走在庞贝古城的废墟旁
I remember a couple walking through the ruins of Pompeii,

1320
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:12,570
看着那些在那里躺了好几个世纪的尸骸
viewing bodies that had been lying there for centuries.

1321
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,470
我还记得那些尸骸
I remember the bodies, you know,

1322
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,520
他们在睡梦中被捕的时候还紧拥着爱人
caught in their sleep still lovingly holding each other.

1323
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:21,590
我也不知道为什么 有时候我经常在想
I don't know why, sometimes I have this image in my mind,

1324
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:24,470
你搂着我 我们躺在一起
where, you know, we're asleep and you hold me.

1325
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:26,650
在炽热的灰烬下被活活掩埋
What... of being buried alive under molten ash?

1326
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:28,370
- 你就是在想这些吗  - 是的
- That's what you're thinking about?  - Yes!

1327
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,590
这可一点都不好玩
That's not very fun!

1328
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,630
我不知道 其实也没那么可怕
I don't know... It's not horrible I mean,

1329
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:36,380
他们当中 有些夫妇中间还躺着孩子
they had some bodies with little kids sleeping between them.

1330
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:37,780
那很好
That's nice.

1331
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:39,740
是啊 我想我年轻的时候有些病态
Yeah, I guess I was young and a bit morbid,

1332
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:42,770
觉得和自己心爱的人死在一起是很浪漫的事
I mean at that age you romanticize dying with the person you love.

1333
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:44,450
那现在你愿意和我一起死吗
Now you want to die with me?

1334
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,740
也许吧 你知道 如果是
Maybe you know if you were... you know,

1335
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:50,010
我们在一起的第一个晚上 也许会
our first night together then,

1336
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:52,050
可那是好久以前了 现在我才不
a long time ago, but now... no!

1337
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:52,970
我想活着
I'd like to live!

1338
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:55,440
我也只是想来点浪漫的 也被你破坏了
I just wanted you to say something romantic and you blew it!

1339
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,690
算了吧 去你妈的 我搞砸了
Oh no! Putain de merde. I blew it!

1340
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,970
等我们都九十八岁了 你可以再问一次
Ok, if we are both 98, you can ask me again.

1341
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:02,840
不过现在
But any time sooner,

1342
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:06,330
对不起了
Sorry.

1343
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:08,720
这就是我说过的那个拜占庭时期
Hey... This is the chapel I was telling you about.

1344
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,300
就有了的小教堂 已经有一千年历史了
It's from the Byzantine era, like a 1000 years old.

1345
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:14,450
- 我们能进去吗  - 当然能了
- Can we go in?  - Yes, I think so.

1346
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:18,550
来看看 有人吗
Check this out! Hello!

1347
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,990
这是圣奥蒂莉亚的神龛 她是视力的守护神
It's a shrine to St. Odilia, the patron saint to eyesight.

1348
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:25,970
人们从各处前来
People come from all over

1349
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:28,140
给盲人留下各种小贡品
and they leave little dedications to the blind

1350
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:30,080
帮助他们恢复视力
to help restore sight.

1351
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:32,130
一定很灵吧
I'm sure, it works.

1352
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:34,210
这里的这些画
And these paitings here,

1353
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:36,820
让我联想到日本的和尚
they make me think of those Japanese monks, you know,

1354
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:38,370
还有他们的无常思想
with their deal on impermanence?

1355
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:40,990
天热时 他们喜欢用水在石头上画画
They like to paint with water on rock on hot days

1356
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:43,870
所以画完的时候 就都蒸发了
so by the time they're done it's already evaporated.

1357
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,680
眼睛被挖掉了 是和失明有关吗
Oh, the eyes are scratched out is that about blindness?

1358
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:47,800
不 我本来也那么想
No, I thought that too,

1359
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,550
但是那个看守人
but the caretaker guy

1360
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:53,920
他告诉我 是土耳其人占领的时候干的
he told me that the Turks did that during the occupation.

1361
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:57,330
好吧 我再也不吃土耳其食物了
That's it. I'm never eating Turkish food again.

1362
00:59:57,850 --> 00:59:59,080
好吧
Oh, ok.

1363
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,420
那会让整个国际社会为之一颤的
That will send a shiver through international community.

1364
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:04,350
好吧 那我再也不给土耳其人吹箫了
OK, fine. Then I will never suck another turkish cock.

1365
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:08,090
那绝对会冲击整个世界
OK that's gonna have a global impact.

1366
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:09,300
那太糟糕了
Oh that's terrible.

1367
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,170
我忘了你是个秘密修行的基督徒
No! I forgot you're a closet-Christian.

1368
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:13,850
在教堂里开黄色玩笑是不是太不敬了
Is it really bad to make blowjob jokes in a church?

1369
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:17,810
有一点 但我们干过更过分的
It kind of is, ok? But we've done worse.

1370
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:27,710
姑娘们又问起我们的婚礼是什么样的了
The girls asked me again what our wedding was like.

1371
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:28,980
是吗 那你怎么说的
Yeah? And what did you say?

1372
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:31,940
我就说 婚礼很低调
I said it was very low-key.

1373
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:34,750
是很低调 以至于我都不记得这回事了
Very low-key, so low-key I don't even remember it.

1374
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:36,120
[贵格会：反对繁琐的形式，婚礼葬礼极简]
很有贵格会风格吧
Very quaker?

1375
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,490
我不知道她们为什么这么想要我们结婚
I do not know why they want us to be married so badly.

1376
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:40,160
这对她们很重要
It is important to them.

1377
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:43,120
- 这里是教堂 你想结婚吗  - 不想
- We are in a church, do you want to get married?  - No.

1378
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,940
只是 她们那么喜欢那些童话
It's just all those fairy tales they like so much, you know.

1379
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,890
记不记得 她们小一点的时候
Remember when they were little

1380
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:53,400
她们看完每一部动画片
and at the end of every cartoon they watched

1381
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,250
就会喊“他们要结婚了”
they'd be all like "They are getting married!"

1382
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:57,080
甚至是匹诺曹和他爸爸
Even if it was Pinocchio and his Dad,

1383
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,630
唐老鸭和侄子们 也不例外
Donald Duck and his nephews.

1384
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:07,250
那如果我们要再一起生活五十六年
So if we are going to spend another 56 more years together...

1385
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,830
- 怎么样  - 你希望我改变什么
- Yeah?  - What about me would you like to change?

1386
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:13,290
- 怎么了  - 这又是一个答不对的问题
- What?  - That's another one of your "Can't win" questions.

1387
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,250
- 我才不上当呢  - 说什么呢
- I am not answering that.  - What do you mean?!

1388
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:18,060
难道我身上就没有一点是你想改变的吗
There is not one thing that you would like to change about me?

1389
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:19,030
我这么完美吗
I'm perfect?

1390
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:21,460
- 好吧 其实  - 就说一个
- Ok, actually,  - One thing.

1391
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:23,750
如果你能改变一个地方
if I could change one thing about you,

1392
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:27,550
我希望你不要再试图改变我了
it would be for you to stop trying to change me.

1393
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,940
你真是个有手段的操纵者 你知道吗
You are a very skilled manipulator, you know that?

1394
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:31,530
戳中你要害了吧
Well, I am on to you.

1395
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:33,770
- 我知道你的套路  - 你这么想吗
- I know how you work.  - You think?

1396
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:35,270
当然 我了解你的一切
Yeah, I know everything about you.

1397
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:36,660
这里 我们从这里走
Here we go, let's go through here.

1398
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:39,630
- 我觉得你没那么了解我  - 没有吗
- I don't think you do, actually.  - No?

1399
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,610
至少你是我在这世上最了解的人
Well, I know you better than I know anybody else on the planet.

1400
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:45,160
- 不过这可能说明不了什么  - 现在
- But, maybe that's not saying much.  - Right now,

1401
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:46,590
- 什么  - 这样很好
- What?  - this is great, you know?

1402
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:48,180
- 是啊  - 我觉得和你很亲近
- Right. Yeah.  - I feel close to you,

1403
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:49,870
- 对  - 但有时候 怎么说呢
- Yeah.  - But sometimes I don't know,

1404
01:01:49,870 --> 01:01:53,730
你呼吸的是氦气 我呼吸的是氧气
I feel like you're breathing helium and I'm breathing oxygen.

1405
01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:55,120
为什么这么说
What makes you say that?

1406
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,970
- 你看 我正想和你沟通  - 拜托
- See? I'm trying to truly connect  - Why, come on.

1407
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:59,070
- 你却开玩笑  - 我只是想做自己
- and you make a joke!  - I'm just being myself.

1408
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:02,710
- 不  - 我说的就是这个
- No!  - That's exactly what I'm talking about.

1409
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:05,230
拜托 如果我们真的想要了解对方
C'mon. If we ever gonna truly know each other,

1410
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:08,480
我觉得我们或许应该先看清自己
I think we probably have to get to know ourselves better first.

1411
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:10,800
是啊
Yeah.

1412
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:13,100
你还记得我那个朋友吗
Do you remember this friend of mine,

1413
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,040
纽约的乔治
George from New York?

1414
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:16,540
不记得
No.

1415
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,480
不对 那是在之前 在之前 不不
Oh no, that was before. That was before. No, no.

1416
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,440
总之他就是我一个朋友
Anyway, he was this friend of mine

1417
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,310
他得知自己得了白血病
that when he found out that he had leukemia

1418
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:25,410
知道自己活不长了
and he was probably gonna die,

1419
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:27,670
他向我坦言 他的第一个反应
he confessed to me that the first thing that came to his mind

1420
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:29,510
- 是解脱  - 解脱 什么解脱
- was relief.  - Relief? Of what?

1421
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:32,490
在他知道自己只能再活九个月之前
Yeah, well, before he found out that he had nine months to live

1422
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:34,460
他总是在担心钱不够花
he was always so worried about money.

1423
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,750
而知道了以后 他的想法是
And now his thought was

1424
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:36,570
太好了
"Great!"

1425
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:38,760
这些钱让我花上九个月 绰绰有余了
"I have more than enough money to live the next 9 months,

1426
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,540
- 我成功了  - 好吧
- I've made it!"  - OK.

1427
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:43,980
接着他终于学会享受生活中的一切
And then he was finally able to enjoy everything about life

1428
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:46,190
甚至享受堵车的感觉
even like being stuck in traffic.

1429
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:49,350
他会很享受地看着人们 看着他们的脸
He would just enjoy looking at people and staring at their faces.

1430
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:52,000
- 就是这种小事  - 那后来呢
- Just little things.  - And then what happened?

1431
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:53,930
什么意思
What do you mean?

1432
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,940
就是 他现在还活着吗
Well... like, is he still alive?

1433
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:58,780
不 他死了 很久了
No, he died a long time ago.

1434
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:04,610
昨晚我做了一个梦 我在看一本书
Last night, I had this dream, where I was reading a book, ok?

1435
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:06,700
是一本失传了的经典 叫《流浪者》
It was a lost classic "The Rovers".

1436
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:09,500
- 流浪者  - 是啊 到处晃荡 溜达
- "The Rovers"?  - Yeah like roving around, you know, wandering.

1437
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:10,800
都是一些年轻人
It was all these young people.

1438
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:13,410
- 真有这本书吗  - 没有 但它很棒
- OK. Is that a real book?  - No, but it was really great.

1439
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:16,360
新颖 有趣 写实 充满能量
It was fresh, funny, experimental, had all this energy.

1440
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,940
真佩服你 在梦里也能看书
I love that you read books in your dreams.

1441
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:19,760
是啊 而且梦里的书都棒极了
I know, and they're always really good!

1442
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,990
我会做一些大型动作英雄梦
I have, like,major action hero dreams.

1443
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:26,480
我像个超级英雄一样 可以打破墙壁
Like I'm flying around like a super hero breaking through walls.

1444
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:30,070
结果我就高潮了
And at the end I have an orgasm.

1445
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:34,930
我会想办法让你的梦成真的 宝贝
I'm gonna try to make your dreams come true baby.

1446
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:51,030
还在那儿
Still there.

1447
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:55,860
还在那儿
Still there.

1448
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:09,390
还在
Still there.

1449
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,530
还在
Still there.

1450
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:23,520
没了
Gone.

1451
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:41,270
- 请给我信用卡  - 那房间付过钱了吧
- I need your credit card.  - Oh I think the room is paid for.

1452
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:44,410
是的 但信用卡是用于
Yes it is, but the credit card is for

1453
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:48,200
- 可能的费用  - 杂费
- possible outcomes?  - Incidentals.

1454
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,450
原来如此
Of course.

1455
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:50,850
- 华莱士先生  - 你好
- Mr. Wallace.  - Yes?

1456
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:53,230
我是这两本书的忠实读者
I am such a fan of these two books.

1457
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:55,730
我丈夫在我们第一次约会时给了我第一本
My husband gave me your book on our first date.

1458
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:57,580
而你的第二本书出版后
And then when your second book came out

1459
01:04:57,590 --> 01:04:59,890
我们一起放声朗读
we read it out loud together.

1460
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:03,090
- 您可以为我签一下吗  - 当然 没问题
- Would you plese sign it for me?  - Yeah, of course, of course.

1461
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:06,850
我喜欢希腊版本的插图
I love the artwork on these Greek editions.

1462
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:08,570
真漂亮
It's really nice.

1463
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:10,020
你们怎么称呼
What are you names?

1464
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:12,850
就写 致索菲亚和帕夫洛斯
Make it to Sophia and Pavlos.

1465
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:14,040
好的
OK.

1466
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:19,690
- 这是希腊语译名吗  - 是叫
- That's the Greek translation?  - Well it's called the ...

1467
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:25,100
但我也不知道对不对
But I'm not sure that is correct.

1468
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:28,170
- 因为你也没读过英文版的吧  - 是的
- It's because you never read it in English, right?  - Exactly.

1469
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:31,050
太棒了
That's great.

1470
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,990
您可以也签一下吗
Could you sign them too?

1471
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,710
- 我吗  - 是的
- Me?  - Yes!

1472
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:36,780
您才是灵感的来源 不是吗
You are the real mother, right?

1473
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:40,490
玛德琳 其实不是 人们以为那是我
Madeleine, not really. People assume that it's me.

1474
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:44,450
但其实完全不是 他想象力很丰富
But it's not me at all. He's got a big imagination.

1475
01:05:44,910 --> 01:05:46,160
求您了
Would you be so kind?

1476
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,410
我丈夫会深感荣幸的
It would mean so much to my husband.

1477
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:52,330
这书不是我写的 我不能签…我…
I can't sign a book I did not write... I...

1478
01:05:52,330 --> 01:05:53,390
- 她很乐意  - 好吧
- She'd be happy to.  - OK.

1479
01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:54,830
太好了 谢谢
Great. Thank you.

1480
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:57,030
我很乐意
I'm happy to.

1481
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:03,780
好的 谢谢您
Ok, thank you.

1482
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:08,330
真棒 太感谢了
Great, thank you so much.

1483
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:15,170
- 瞧瞧这个  - 真不错
- Check it out.  - Wow, this is nice.

1484
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:20,390
有空调 我喜欢 我的天啊
Air conditioning! Oh, I love it! Oh my god.

1485
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:25,550
还有浴缸
Oh wow! A bathtub!

1486
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:28,550
- 我的天啊  - 来 看看这个
- My God!  - Hey, check this out!

1487
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:31,330
斯特凡诺斯和阿里阿德涅给我们弄了瓶酒
Stefanos and Ariadni got us a bottle of wine

1488
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:33,500
还有情侣按摩
and a couple's massage.

1489
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:36,150
他们真好 我们得给他们留个礼物再走
They are so nice. We have to get them a present before we leave.

1490
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:38,190
没错 也得记得给孩子们带点东西
I know. We should remember to get something for the kids, too.

1491
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,110
是啊 当然了
Yeah, no, for sure.

1492
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:50,360
- 我想姑娘们了  - 我不想
- I miss the girls.  - I don't.

1493
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,320
这儿风景真好
It's such a nice view.

1494
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:56,590
我只对一个风景感兴趣
The only view that I am interested in

1495
01:06:57,890 --> 01:06:58,860
什么
What?

1496
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:02,440
就在这里
is right here.

1497
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:25,190
怎么了
What?

1498
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:28,960
有意思 我今天才发现
It's funny. I never noticed until today

1499
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,140
你的红色胡子 都消失了
but all the red in your beard is gone.

1500
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,760
那曾经是我对你着迷的一个原因
It used to be one of the things that made me fall for you.

1501
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,170
够疯狂的
It's crazy.

1502
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:43,360
不是消失了 只是变白了
It's not gone. It's just white.

1503
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:45,020
你不会是想告诉我
You're not gonna tell me that

1504
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,730
你的爱还得看颜色吧
your love is dependent on pigment, are you?

1505
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,330
- 不是  - 不是
- No.  - No?

1506
01:07:49,330 --> 01:07:50,770
不是 但你知道吗
No, but you know,

1507
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:54,730
姑娘们的睫毛上也有那种红色
I see the red in our girls' eyelashes.

1508
01:07:54,730 --> 01:07:58,170
我看着她们 就想起我们的相遇
I look at them and it makes me think of when we met.

1509
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:04,900
你知道我现在期待什么吗
You know what I'm looking forward to?

1510
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:07,330
- 什么  - 过后
- Yeah? What?  - After...

1511
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:09,250
- 过后  - 对
- After...  - Yeah.

1512
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,750
就是明天在你身边醒来
Is waking up next to you tomorrow.

1513
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:16,650
你是说 没有妮娜和艾拉在边上蹦蹦跳跳
You mean, without Nina and Ella jumping on our heads?

1514
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:18,230
没错
Exactly.

1515
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:21,730
我好几年没听过你思考了
I haven't heard you think in years now.

1516
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,070
思考
Think?

1517
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,750
我以前一醒来 就能听见那声音
I used to wake up to that sound.

1518
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:31,260
你的眼睛睁开又闭上
With your eyes opening and closing.

1519
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:34,520
你的头脑 以两百万里的时速飞奔
And that brain of yours, going two million miles an hour.

1520
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:38,640
我很想念 听见你在思考的感觉
I miss it. Hearing you think.

1521
01:08:39,670 --> 01:08:41,280
你刚才说你能听见我思考
When you said you could hear me think

1522
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,030
我还真以为你能听见呢
I really thought you could.

1523
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:44,770
原来是我睁眼闭眼的声音
But it was just my eyelids.

1524
01:08:44,770 --> 01:08:46,420
我真是够傻够天真
How dumb and romantic of me.

1525
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:48,380
我喜欢的就是这个
That's my favorite thing.

1526
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,290
我也怀念思考的感觉
I miss thinking too.

1527
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:56,230
清晨再没时间思考了
No more thinking in the morning.

1528
01:08:56,230 --> 01:08:57,710
再没有晨光性爱
No more morning sex.

1529
01:08:57,710 --> 01:08:59,370
明天怎么样
Tomorrow?

1530
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:02,440
我太期待了
I'm looking forward to it so much,

1531
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,400
我觉得我要睡不着了
I don't think I'll be able to sleep.

1532
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,930
我现在就想要
I'm looking forward to it right now.

1533
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,220
好了
OK.

1534
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:16,470
我们别说话了 开干吧
Let's stop talking so we can fuck,

1535
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,320
然后睡觉
sleep,

1536
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,620
醒来
wake up,

1537
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,020
思考 再做爱
think and fuck again.

1538
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:34,080
- 别接了  - 不行
- Don't answer it.  - No.

1539
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,810
- 见鬼 谁打的  - 管他呢
- Oh shit, who is it?  - Who cares?

1540
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:41,680
我说了紧急情况才打的
I said to call in case of emergency only.

1541
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,560
希望不是姑娘们出事了
I hope the girls are ok.

1542
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:48,730
是亨利
Oh, it's Henry.

1543
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,910
亲爱的 你好吗
Hey sweetie, are you okay?

1544
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:52,800
你到伦敦了吗
Are you in London?

1545
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:57,630
这么快吗 好的
Already? OK.

1546
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:02,000
不不 我们找到了
Oh no, no, we found it.

1547
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:04,580
我们明天就寄过去 别担心
We'll mail it tomorrow, don't worry.

1548
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:05,840
对
Yeah.

1549
01:10:08,890 --> 01:10:10,890
她们也很想你
Oh, they miss you too.

1550
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:12,500
我会代你吻她们的
I'll kiss them for you.

1551
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,740
好啊
Yeah.

1552
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,200
好的 我会转告她们的
OK. I'll tell them.

1553
01:10:17,330 --> 01:10:19,320
和你妈妈相处愉快
Good luck with your mom, yeah.

1554
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,550
我也爱你 再见
I love you too, bye.

1555
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:22,910
好的
OK.

1556
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:26,280
他很好
He's fine.

1557
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:29,120
他说到了芝加哥就给你打电话
He says he will call you from Chicago when he lands.

1558
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:30,580
为什么不让我和他说话
Why can't I talk to him?

1559
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:31,660
你已经第二次这样了
That's twice you've done that.

1560
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:33,130
你完全可以把手机给我的
Come on, you could have just handed me the phone.

1561
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:34,210
你知道我很想和他聊聊
You know I wanted to talk to him.

1562
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:36,480
他没时间多聊 他说他们在登机了
Well he didn't have time to talk. He said they were boarding.

1563
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:37,710
他是什么忘带了 什么东西
What did he forget? What was that?

1564
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:40,760
他的科学项目报告 我们明天就去寄
His science project, but we'll mail it tomorrow.

1565
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:43,760
- 他没事的  - 你不该那样说他妈妈
- He'll be fine  - You shouldn't have said that about his mom.

1566
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,300
什么 我说什么了
What? What did I say?

1567
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:47,240
和你妈妈相处愉快
"Good luck with your mom."

1568
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,680
- 拜托  - 我可没别的意思
- I mean, c'mon...  - I  didn't mean anything by it.

1569
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,100
我知道 但这样不好
I know, but it's not good.

1570
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:52,540
这样又让他想起了整件事情
You know, it just reminds him of the whole thing

1571
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:53,570
我真希望你别那样
and I wish you wouldn't do that.

1572
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:55,230
你以为我不说他就忘了吗
Oh, like you think he forgets?

1573
01:10:55,230 --> 01:10:56,030
真是典型的美式思维
That's so American

1574
01:10:56,030 --> 01:10:58,560
掩盖事实 当做从未发生
to just swipe it under the carpet and act as if it didn't happen.

1575
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:00,350
我是说 为什么要让他想起来呢
Why put it into his head, you know?

1576
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:02,990
或许他这会儿不想去想这件事呢
What if he does not want to think about it right now?

1577
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:06,870
- 不会有影响的  - 会有一点 会的
- It means nothing.  - It means something. It does.

1578
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:08,630
好吧 前些天我还和他开了个玩笑
Alright, I even made a joke the other day

1579
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:09,870
说我和他妈妈应该
that his mom and I should try

1580
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:12,590
来一场泥地大摔跤 才能一决胜负
to settle it in one big mud wrestling contest.

1581
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:15,360
- 泥地大摔跤 你真那么说了  - 他笑了
- Mud wrestling? You said that?  - And he laughed.

1582
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:17,320
或许他比你要有幽默感
He might have more of a sense of humour than you do.

1583
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:18,370
拜托
Come on!

1584
01:11:18,370 --> 01:11:19,980
我们刚说过的
I dunno, we just talked about that,

1585
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:21,680
你说他妈妈坏话的时候
you know, when you say bad things about his mom

1586
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,630
他听见的是自己的坏话
what he hears is bad things about himself.

1587
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:26,060
我可没说他妈妈坏话 我开个玩笑而已
Well I didn't say anything bad about his mom, ok? I made a joke.

1588
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:28,250
开的不光是她的玩笑 也是我自己的
It's as much on me as much as it is on her.

1589
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:32,340
我知道 我知道 只是 根本没必要提
I know, I know. It's just why conjure it up at all, you know?

1590
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:34,330
我觉得他现在够大了
I think he's old enough now.

1591
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:37,660
他知道他妈妈和我之间是怎么回事
I mean, he knows how bad it is between his mother and I.

1592
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:39,650
- 是他妈妈和我  - 我什么也没做
- His mom and me.  - And I didn't do anything.

1593
01:11:39,650 --> 01:11:41,410
都是她冲着我来的
It's all coming from her towards me.

1594
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:45,260
她恨我 没错 很久前我睡了她男人
OK, she hates me. Yes. I fucked her husband a long time ago.

1595
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:47,610
或者是不是该说 他睡了我
Or should I say he fucked me?

1596
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:48,820
是啊 没错
Yeah, right.

1597
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:50,650
他妈妈和我本来就不和
Ok, making a joke about the fact

1598
01:11:50,650 --> 01:11:53,350
拿这开个玩笑 没什么大不了的
that his mother and I do not love each other is not the issue.

1599
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:54,950
他不会因为这样就受到创伤
That's not going to traumatize him.

1600
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:56,580
因为他已经受伤了 好吗
That already happened, alright?

1601
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:59,340
现在你想转移你的负罪感给我吗
And now you are trying to transfer your guilt and blame me?

1602
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:00,270
不是
No.

1603
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,050
知道吗 反过来 如果你能一笑了之
You know, on the contrary, if you can make a joke about it

1604
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:04,530
或许你就能好受点
maybe you'll be able to live with it better.

1605
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:06,650
- 我是这么想的  - 好吧
- That's what I think.  - OK.

1606
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:08,750
你说得对 一如既往
You're right, as always.

1607
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:10,490
我们别说这个了 好吗
Let's just not talk about it, ok?

1608
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:13,550
他妈妈要是个醉鬼
It's nobody's fault if his mom

1609
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:15,850
或者虐待狂 可怨不得任何人
is drunk and abusive psychologically.

1610
01:12:15,850 --> 01:12:17,070
别那么说
Don't say that!

1611
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:20,070
他得和她一起生活 想到这我就恶心
I mean it makes me sick that he has to be with her

1612
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:23,440
但我想 法官会认为女人都有母性吧
but I guess judges assume that women have the mother instinct.

1613
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:26,270
[美狄亚：希腊神话中科尔喀斯国王之女，以巫术著称]
她的母性就和美狄亚差不多
She has the mother instinct of Medea!

1614
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,980
美狄亚吗
Medea, huh?

1615
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:29,440
是啊 那不过是个希腊神话
Yeah, after all it is a Greek myth.

1616
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:31,820
[欧里庇得斯：希腊悲剧诗人]
其实是欧里庇得斯的剧作
Actually, a play by Euripides.

1617
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:35,200
一个女人 为惩罚前夫不惜杀死孩子
A woman killing her kids to punish her ex-husband,

1618
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,340
她和这没什么两样
that's basically what she's doing.

1619
01:12:36,350 --> 01:12:37,950
她是在伤害他来报复你
She's hurting him to get to you.

1620
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,530
不 她是利用他来破坏我的生活
No, she's making my life hell through him.

1621
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:41,860
这才是她所做的
That's what she's doing.

1622
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:46,080
但有时候 你说的话太过分了
But sometimes you say things that just go too far.

1623
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:48,260
行了 别把你老婆的这个闹剧里
Ok, stop blaming me for everything that is wrong

1624
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:49,920
所有的问题都怪在我身上 好吗
in this whole thing with your wife, ok?

1625
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:53,060
- 是前妻 很久以前就是前妻了  - 好吧
- Ex-wife! Ex-wife for a long time!  - OK,

1626
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:54,720
你当初就应该处理得好一点
you should have dealt better with it a little better back then,

1627
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,730
她就不会这么恨我们了
she wouldn't have hated us so much, ok?

1628
01:12:56,730 --> 01:12:59,170
好 好 是我搞砸了
OK, ok, I screwed up.

1629
01:12:59,450 --> 01:13:02,570
你真是厉害 我们生活中
Alright. I just love this little rewrite you do that

1630
01:13:02,570 --> 01:13:06,160
有什么不如意 你都能说成是我的错
everything that isn't perfect in our life gets laid at my feet.

1631
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:09,790
现在你要因为亨利 给我扣这种帽子吗
Now you're putting this shit on me about Henry?

1632
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:12,330
什么帽子 你说什么呢
What shit? What are you talking about?

1633
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:14,340
我来告诉你我在说什么吧
Let me tell you what I am talking about.

1634
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:17,360
你这是要我搬去芝加哥 放弃我的生活
The moving to Chicago and giving up my life.

1635
01:13:18,930 --> 01:13:21,350
你说亨利需要你
Now that you mentioned that Henry needs you

1636
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:23,310
你知道我什么感受吗
how do you think that makes me feel?

1637
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:25,500
我很痛苦 知道吗
I'm miserable, alright?

1638
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:28,530
我还怎么接受那份工作 你告诉我
How can I take that job now? Tell me, tell me.

1639
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:29,790
- 我会有负罪感的  - 别这样
- I'll feel too guilty.  - No, no, no.

1640
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:31,930
- 不行不行  - 那是你自己选择
- No, no, no, no.  - That's a choice you're making

1641
01:13:31,930 --> 01:13:33,610
要这样看待它的 明白吗
to look at it like that, alright?

1642
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:37,640
女人就应该做养育者 这是天性
It is in the nature of women to be the nurturer.

1643
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:38,690
什么
The what?

1644
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:41,000
- 养育者  - 养育者
- The nurturer.  - The nurturer?

1645
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,950
好吧 这个词我简直说不出口
OK, I can't even say that fucking word.

1646
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:45,320
我就是本能地会对一切感到内疚
I just naturally feel bad about everything.

1647
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,560
你还给我那种眼神 好像是我的错
And you give me that look like it's my fault.

1648
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:48,350
什么眼神
What look?

1649
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:51,230
就是怪我忘了把项目报告放进包里的眼神
That I forget to put in the bag the science project look.

1650
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,520
- 我知道你怪我  - 我什么也没说
- I know you blame me.  - I didn't say anything.

1651
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,960
对 你是什么也没说 你不用说出来
No, you did not say anything. You didn't have to.

1652
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:59,010
- 错的从来都是我  - 好吧
- Yeah, it's always my fault.  - Yeah right.

1653
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,480
我上班时在冰箱上看到
I read on the fridge at work,

1654
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:05,540
那种用来拼句子的 贴在磁铁上的单词
you know those magnet words that people make sentences with.

1655
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:07,700
有人拼了这么个句子
Someone had put together:

1656
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:13,150
在牺牲的花园里 女人寻求着永生
"Women explore for eternity in the vast garden of sacrifice."

1657
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,600
这一定是上帝的指示吧
Wow, that's a sure sign from God.

1658
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:19,930
是的 这话真他妈是真理
Yeah, that line is so damn true

1659
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:21,370
过去一万年来都是
and it’s been for 10,000 years.

1660
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:22,830
但到此为止
But that's enough, ok?

1661
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:24,490
我不想做这样的女人
I don't want to be one of these women.

1662
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:26,530
就像结婚权对于同性恋
Like marriage is important to gays,

1663
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:28,560
避孕对于维护女权的重要性
or contraception to women rights.

1664
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,460
一旦我失去了信心
It's the same with giving up my hopes,

1665
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:31,530
对于无数妇女
with the millions of women

1666
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:32,860
我也不得不放弃她们的希望
that I have had to give up their hopes.

1667
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:33,870
我不会这样的
I'm not gonna do it!

1668
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:36,330
这不是我一个人的事情
This is bigger than me, this means more than me.

1669
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:44,770
真精彩 连诺贝尔委员会都注意到了
Wow, bravo, the Nobel Committee is taking note, and just...

1670
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:47,200
等下 我去通知一下瑞典方面 好吧
Hold on a second, I'm going to alert Sweden, okay?

1671
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,420
面对如此多的女性压迫问题
I mean... it must be a full-time job

1672
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:50,810
你一定是身负重任
carrying that much feminine oppression.

1673
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:53,100
- 没错  - 遭受了这么多
- It is.  - You suffered so much,

1674
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:54,600
在巴黎中产阶级家庭长大
growing up in middle class Paris,

1675
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,600
[后女性主义：上世纪九十年代女性追求性认同的主义]
在后女性主义者时期
I mean the agony in the trenches

1676
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,570
因索邦主义而苦恼
of the Sorbonne in the post-feminist era.

1677
01:14:58,570 --> 01:14:59,930
实在无法想像
I can not imagine.

1678
01:14:59,930 --> 01:15:01,150
你是个混蛋
You're an asshole.

1679
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:02,800
知道吗 亲爱的
You know what, sweetie?

1680
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:04,810
搬去芝加哥后
When I move into Chicago,

1681
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,850
我一定要找到一套好房子
I want to make sure we're able to find a nice house,

1682
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:09,600
缝制窗帘
and I can sew the drapes,

1683
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,470
挑些搭配的床罩
And pick matching bed covers...

1684
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:14,350
你今晚就打算这样度过吗
So this is how you now want to be spending this evening?

1685
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:16,090
一直说这些吗
I mean, this is, this is what you wanna do tonight?

1686
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:16,980
- 你先开始的  - 不
- Well, you started it.  - No.

1687
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:20,940
是你一直念叨个不停
You're the one who will not shut up about it.

1688
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:24,150
但如果真心想说 我是说谈论什么
But if you want to talk about it, I mean really talk about it.

1689
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:28,210
那就心平气和 理性地说
I would prefer to have an unemotional, rational conversation.

1690
01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:29,270
你觉得我们能做到吗
I mean, do you think we could do that?

1691
01:15:29,270 --> 01:15:31,170
- 这可能吗  - 又开始了
- Would that be possible?  - Here we go.

1692
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:33,280
要心平气和 要理性
Unemotional, rational.

1693
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:36,520
你总是那个理智的人
You always play the part of the one and only rational one.

1694
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:40,100
而我一直在不可理喻歇斯底里地闹
And I'm the irrational, hysterical, hormone-crazy one,

1695
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:41,530
是因为我有感情
because I have emotions.

1696
01:15:41,530 --> 01:15:44,580
是 你以旁观者从全局角度谈论问题
Yeah, you sit back and you speak from your big perspective,

1697
01:15:44,580 --> 01:15:47,200
所以你说出来的一定是经过冷静思考的
which means everything you say is level-headed and true.

1698
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,330
- 我也没有总是袖手旁观  - 整个世界
- I don't always do anything.  - The world is fucked

1699
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:52,190
都被冷静而理智的男人的决策给毁掉了
by unemotional, irrational men deciding shit.

1700
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:55,140
政客无故就计划开战
Alright? Politicians going to war for no reason,

1701
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:57,740
商业巨头要榨干能源
corporate heads deciding to rape the environment.

1702
01:15:57,740 --> 01:16:00,840
钱尼·拉姆斯菲尔德 多么理智的男人
Chaney, Rumsfeld, very rational men.

1703
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,510
钱尼·拉姆斯菲尔德 那倒是
Chaney, Rumsfeld, yeah, ok.

1704
01:16:02,510 --> 01:16:03,900
如果我知道解决办法
If I know a solution,

1705
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:06,190
一定是经过深思熟虑才决定的
Very rational thinking behind it.

1706
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:09,390
所以我们现在是怎样 挑战最终解决方案
Okay, so we are there now? Us versus the final solution.

1707
01:16:09,390 --> 01:16:12,800
行 这样 回答我一个问题好吧
Okay... let's do it, alright? Let me ask you this, alright?

1708
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,520
你觉得亨利的生活
Do you think Henry's life

1709
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,980
会不会因为你我关系更为稳定
would be helped by more consistent presence

1710
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:19,060
而有所改善
by you and me?

1711
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:20,980
- 又来了  - 不
- Here we go.  - No.

1712
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:23,410
你不罢休 那就好好来谈谈 行不
You won't drop it. So let's talk about it. Alright?

1713
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:25,430
我就问你一句
Let me just ask you one question.

1714
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,340
汉克会不会因为你我关系更为稳定
Do you think Hank's life would be better served by

1715
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:30,530
而在生活上得到更好的照顾
more consistent presence from you and me?

1716
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:32,760
当然 他跟我们住一起会更好
Yes! I think it would be better if he lived with us.

1717
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:33,750
- 对  - 而且他妈
- Okay.  - And I think his mom

1718
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:36,300
是个酗酒又讨厌的贱人
is a fucking alcoholic, hateful cunt

1719
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,810
利用我们在巴黎 我在生孩子的时间
that used the time we were in Paris and I was giving birth,

1720
01:16:38,810 --> 01:16:42,590
差点就把亨利合法驱逐出纽约
and almost dying to legally move Henry out of New York.

1721
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,990
操丫的
Fuck her!

1722
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:46,600
好 这我同意你
Okay, I agree with you.

1723
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,870
虽然遗憾的是 我们不能让他离开美国
Okay, unfortunately we can not go and get him out of America,

1724
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:52,820
但可以在想去见他的时候过去
but we could if we wanted to go to him.

1725
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:55,310
虽然这是个大变动
Now I know it would be a big move,

1726
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:56,120
但你还是考虑考虑如何
but what do you think? I mean

1727
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:59,710
在美国就真的找不到让你开心的事情吗
is there any way that you could be happy in the US?

1728
01:16:59,730 --> 01:17:02,160
难道去美国就是不可能的事情吗
I mean is that just out of the realm of possibility?

1729
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:04,700
也可以找一份差不多的工作的 是不是
I mean you could find a comparable job there?

1730
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:06,010
- 差不多的  - 对啊
- Comparable job?  - Yeah!

1731
01:17:06,010 --> 01:17:07,540
- 你搞笑的吧  - 不
- Are you kidding?  - No.

1732
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:09,640
为什么总让我来妥协
Why am I the one that always have to make the compromises?

1733
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:10,560
天哪
Jesus Christ.

1734
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:13,360
- 不应该是  - 别搞这么夸张 好吗
- I mean it should be...  - Don't be so dramatic, okay?

1735
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,010
我 反正要搬去芝加哥这事
I... Well, moving to Chicago is

1736
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:17,590
- 对我来说就是很夸张  - 我不是说
- Pretty fucking dramatic to me.  - I'm not saying

1737
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:20,500
就该搬过去 我只是想谈谈这可能性
we should move. I just want to talk about it.

1738
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:23,070
你就不能淡定那么两秒钟 好好谈谈吗
Can you be my friend for like two seconds so we can talk?

1739
01:17:23,070 --> 01:17:24,400
- 行 就一会儿  - 好的
- Okay, two seconds  - Alright.

1740
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,840
记不记得你有一次
Do you remember that time that you were like

1741
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,820
去接女儿们 迟到了大概三十五分钟
35 minutes late to pick up the girls from school,

1742
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:29,290
你当时紧张死了
and you were so stressed out,

1743
01:17:29,290 --> 01:17:30,970
因为你知道她们在操场上
because you knew they were out there in the playground,

1744
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,630
担心你是不是出什么事了
wondering what the hell happened to you?

1745
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,770
而我 一直都有这种感觉
Okay, that is the way that I feel all the time.

1746
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:37,740
我把自己的生活弄得一团糟
You know, like I fucked up, I mean,

1747
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:40,230
之前一直没管他 现在我就想去接他
I left him behind and I just want to go get him.

1748
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:42,990
你每次送他走就会这样
You always get like this when you drop him off.

1749
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:45,480
你很失落 然后就开始跟我吵
You're sad, so you start a fight.

1750
01:17:45,690 --> 01:17:50,180
他没事的 他是个很棒的孩子 好吗
He's fine, he's a great kid, ok?

1751
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:53,430
但事实就是他不再需要你像之前那样操心
But the truth is that he does not need you the way he used to.

1752
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:55,080
你错过了可以陪伴
You missed the opportunity to be with him

1753
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,220
在他童年每一天的机会
every day of his childhood,

1754
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:57,530
已经错过了
You just did.

1755
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,940
就算你再懊恼流泪 他也已经长大了
And you can cry about it, but he is growing up.

1756
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,150
其他方面你是个很好的父亲
You're a great father in other ways,

1757
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:07,430
离婚又不是什么稀奇事
you got divorced like millions of other people.

1758
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:08,830
要说它适合吗 当然不是
Was it ideal? No.

1759
01:18:08,970 --> 01:18:10,030
但是
But...

1760
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:11,370
听着
Listen,

1761
01:18:11,370 --> 01:18:14,560
如果一个月后你依旧想让我辞职
if in one month, you still want me to quit my job,

1762
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,300
让我抛弃这些年积攒下的一切跟你走
and give up everything I've been working towards all these years,

1763
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:18,450
直说就是了
just ask me.

1764
01:18:18,450 --> 01:18:21,730
但现在我这个想法是一直都有的
But right now I I feel the same way I always have.

1765
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:23,190
我可以搬回美国
I would move back to the US

1766
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:26,360
只要你的变态前妻能共享共同监护权
if that diseased ex-wife of yours give us joint custody.

1767
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:29,090
但每隔一周的周末就会很难熬了 杰西
But every other weekend amounts to shit, Jesse.

1768
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:31,040
一学期差不多就有三十天
That's less than 30 days a semester,

1769
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:34,710
而我们为了那样的生活来放弃现在的日子
and I don't think it's worth it for us to change our entire lives

1770
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:35,940
是不值得的
Over that kind of time.

1771
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:37,630
- 你说的没错  - 是吧
- I know you're right.  - Right, right?

1772
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:40,470
看 我倒成了理性的那个
See? I'm being the rational one.

1773
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:46,370
但是 汉克处境太糟 他是无辜的
It's just... A shitty position. I mean Hank didn't do anything,

1774
01:18:46,370 --> 01:18:48,830
可他却被一直忽略
but he's the one getting kicked in the teeth.

1775
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:51,280
人或多或少都会被父母的生活所拖累
We all get dragged through our parent's lives.

1776
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:54,300
如果不是我 你的婚姻又会是另种情况
If it wasn't me, your marriage would have ended over something else.

1777
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:55,790
- 这你很清楚  - 当然
- And you know that.  - Absolutely.

1778
01:18:55,790 --> 01:18:57,410
所以他可能会被贫困家庭养育
Or even worse he would have been raised

1779
01:18:57,410 --> 01:18:58,970
这更糟
by two miserable parents.

1780
01:18:58,980 --> 01:18:59,980
没错
Right...

1781
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:03,650
我真是生活一团糟啊
I just really fucked that up.

1782
01:19:06,550 --> 01:19:09,070
你是说因为搬来巴黎和我在一起了吗
You mean you fucked up by moving to Paris to be with me?

1783
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:10,580
- 不是  - 不
- No...  - No,

1784
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:12,380
- 我就知道代价太大  - 我不是…
- I knew that was going to cost too much.  - That's not what I meant...

1785
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:14,190
- 停 我不是这意思  - 我就知道
- Stop! That's not what I meant at all.  - I knew it.

1786
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:16,060
- 我劝过你的 好吗  - 别说了
- I told you not to do this, okay?  - Stop it!

1787
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:20,210
没错 当初我抛下一切搬去纽约
Okay... I moved to New York with you for two years,

1788
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,050
跟你住了两年
and gave up everything.

1789
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:24,390
但我需要回来生孩子
But I needed to be home to give birth to the twins,

1790
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:25,680
因为双胞胎生产太复杂
because it was a complicated birth,

1791
01:19:25,690 --> 01:19:28,480
我还想妈妈能陪我 你也是这样想的
and I wanted to be with my mother and you wanted it, too.

1792
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:29,470
- 对吧  - 是
- Okay?  - Yes.

1793
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:31,160
- 这是我唯一要求的事情  - 是
- That's the one thing I asked from you.  - Okay.

1794
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:34,890
唯一一件 你就要因此永远责备我吗
The one thing... and now you're gonna blame me forever?

1795
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:37,020
别说了 好吗
Stop it, will you?

1796
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:38,450
别说了
Stop it.

1797
01:19:38,710 --> 01:19:42,410
如果你不想搬回美国 我们就不搬
If you don't want to move back to the States, we won't.

1798
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:43,770
就不用再说了
End of story.

1799
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,510
好吗 我只是在想
Alright? I am just trying to find a way

1800
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:49,130
究竟住在哪里 我的生活才能更稳定
where I can be a more consistent presence in his life

1801
01:19:49,130 --> 01:19:52,430
能让他生活得更好 就像一家人一样
and ideally I would like to do that as a family.

1802
01:19:53,110 --> 01:19:54,790
不然你想分居还是离婚
As a family or what?

1803
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,100
这他妈是怎么说起来的
What the fuck does that mean?

1804
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:01,680
我能感受到你说的每个字
I feel a passive-aggressive threat

1805
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:02,960
都带有消极进攻的威胁
in everything you say,

1806
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:07,000
如果不这样 你就会怨我一辈子的
Either do this or I will resent you for the rest of our lives.

1807
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:08,810
是不是
No?

1808
01:20:09,950 --> 01:20:11,090
没错吧
Am I right?

1809
01:20:13,210 --> 01:20:16,240
我觉得…
You know what? I'm sensing something...

1810
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,410
问题在于
I, I, I think the problem is,

1811
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:21,440
你不想让我有一份稳定的工作
is that you do not want me to have a more substantial job.

1812
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:23,410
从某种程度上来说
On some level you feel threatened

1813
01:20:23,410 --> 01:20:25,220
你因为我的成就而有威胁感
by my achieving anything

1814
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:27,670
在咱俩的关系中会削减你的地位
that could diminish your status in our relationship.

1815
01:20:27,670 --> 01:20:30,420
我在这段关系中的地位吗
My status in our relationship?

1816
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:35,050
我他妈在美国学校一学期教两门 好吗
I teach two courses a semester at the fucking American school, okay?

1817
01:20:35,050 --> 01:20:37,870
真是有地位啊
Wow, that's really some status!

1818
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:39,330
不 你会在我有这样一个绝佳的
No, no. I don't think it's any coincidence

1819
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:41,200
工作机遇之时
that you feel that way at the same time

1820
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,520
却有那样的想法绝不是偶然
that I have a truly exciting job opportunity.

1821
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:47,950
你很清楚 这一连串的都是你在瞎想
This whole train of thought is complete horseshit and you know it.

1822
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,010
我问你
I have a question for you:

1823
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:54,120
如果我们没有女儿 还有这些有的没的
If we didn't have the girls, all our crap.

1824
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,040
我们还会在一起吗
Would we even still be together?

1825
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,470
什么
What?

1826
01:20:57,470 --> 01:21:00,090
拜托 你他妈简直不可理喻
I mean, you're the fucking mayor of the crazy town.

1827
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:01,260
你自己也知道啊 不是吗
Do you know that? You are.

1828
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:03,820
我觉得 你必须搬去芝加哥
You know what I think? I think you have to move to Chicago.

1829
01:21:03,820 --> 01:21:04,940
亨利需要你
I think Henry needs you,

1830
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:06,700
而我和女儿们就留在巴黎
and I think I need to stay in Paris with the girls,

1831
01:21:06,710 --> 01:21:07,780
接受这份工作
and take this job.

1832
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:11,260
你为什么要这样 简直不可理喻
Why are you doing this? That's a ridiculous idea,

1833
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:13,940
要我离开你和女儿们 不行
Like I'm gonna lose you and the girls? No!

1834
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:15,650
你干嘛把所有的事情都复杂化
Why do you make everything so difficult?

1835
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:17,290
杰西 你跟我在一起并不快乐
Jesse, you're unhappy with me.

1836
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:19,630
你怪我让你离开你的儿子
You're blaming me for taking you away from your son.

1837
01:21:19,630 --> 01:21:22,170
你这样说也太莫名了
That is a completely irrational response

1838
01:21:22,170 --> 01:21:24,800
我只是在理清我的思路
to something I'm just trying to feel my way through.

1839
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:27,260
听着 杰西
Listen, Jesse.

1840
01:21:27,790 --> 01:21:30,210
在这一个半月里
We just spent the last six weeks here,

1841
01:21:31,610 --> 01:21:33,030
我们过得很开心
and it's been great.

1842
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:36,640
你每天都能思如泉涌
You've been able to write every day,

1843
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:39,010
天气也十分美好
and the weather has been nice.

1844
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:42,120
- 但我之前并不想来希腊  - 我知道
- But I didn't want to come to Greece.  - I know.

1845
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:45,550
是吧 你无法预料下一秒会发生什么
Right? There could be a revolution any second.

1846
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:48,480
人们会吃掉很多羊乳酪和橄榄油
People eat a lot of feta and olive oil.

1847
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,230
表面上看起来很开心
And they act all happy,

1848
01:21:50,230 --> 01:21:52,630
但实际谈论的却是自己受了多少气
but they actually talk about how angry they are.

1849
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,700
我就犹豫了
And it confuses me,

1850
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,520
- 不知道以后到底会怎样  - 好吧
- And I don't know what's gonna happen.  - Okay.

1851
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:57,990
我来告诉你将来会如何
Let me tell you what's gonna happen, alright?

1852
01:21:57,990 --> 01:22:01,070
就跟平常一样
the same thing that always happens...

1853
01:22:01,070 --> 01:22:02,540
什么事都没有
Nothing.

1854
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:06,970
是 你知道吗 我没有一点自由时间
Right, you know what? I have had absolutely zero time for myself.

1855
01:22:06,970 --> 01:22:09,230
我还有一万封要回复的邮件
I have ten thousand emails I have to answer

1856
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:10,460
- 没处理  - 等下
- That I didn't answer.  - Wait.

1857
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:11,710
- 你以为我没有吗  - 随便了
- And you think I don't?  - Okay.

1858
01:22:11,710 --> 01:22:13,080
我整天都在做饭
I spend all day making dinner,

1859
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:15,570
擦干你和你儿子在马桶坐垫上的尿
and wiping both you and your son's pee off the toilet seat,

1860
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:17,420
你却在跟同行小说家侃侃而谈
while you talk to your fellow novelist:

1861
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:19,840
哎呀哎呀 你真是个天才
Blah, blah, blah. You are a genius!

1862
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:23,820
哎呀哎呀哎呀哎呀 不 你才是天才
Oh, blah blah blah blah. No! You are a genius!

1863
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:26,270
我们跟亨利道别那一瞬间 你却说
And the second we said goodbye to Henry you suggest that

1864
01:22:26,270 --> 01:22:27,850
我还是得放弃梦寐以求的工作
maybe I should give up my dream job

1865
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:29,060
就因为你情绪低落吗
because you feel bad?

1866
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:30,490
那是 现在它就成了你梦寐以求的了
Okay, now it's your dream job.

1867
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:32,430
今天下午你都不确定你要接受这份工作
This afternoon you weren't even sure you wanted it,

1868
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:33,680
现在就成梦寐以求的了
but now it's your dream job.

1869
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:36,000
你说话从来就不算数是吧
Do you ever listen to yourself?

1870
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,110
没错 这就是我梦寐以求的
Yes, it is my dream job.

1871
01:22:38,110 --> 01:22:40,690
我虽犹豫但不意味着我不想接受
Just because I have doubts doesn't mean that I don't want it.

1872
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:41,840
可是这跟你又有什么关系
Alright, but why do you care?

1873
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:43,330
你每天都要在橄榄树下
Every day you go on your two hours

1874
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:46,010
花两个小时在冥想中散步
contemplative walk under the olive trees.

1875
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:48,390
苏格拉底 你真该穿件袍子
Socrates, oh you should get a robe.

1876
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:49,970
是一个小时
It's an hour.

1877
01:22:49,970 --> 01:22:52,960
不 从你离开到回来
No, by the time you leave and by the time you actually with us again,

1878
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,290
就是两个小时 换我就不行
Two hours. You know, I could never do that,

1879
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:57,280
你实在太会享受了
you are very good at taking care of yourself.

1880
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:59,330
我就自己照顾自己 还要操心别的事情
I take care of myself and everything else.

1881
01:22:59,330 --> 01:23:02,910
去哪里都是你收拾自己的 我收拾别的
We go somewhere you pack your bag and I pack everything else.

1882
01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:05,450
你从来都不会让我收拾女儿的东西
You would never let me pack the girls' shit!

1883
01:23:05,450 --> 01:23:06,120
从来都不会
Never!

1884
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:08,670
因为你会忘了拿鞋子 尽带些脏内裤
'Cause there would be no shoes and plenty of dirty underwear.

1885
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:10,410
是了是了 随便你说
Yeah ok, alright, so says you.

1886
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:11,680
不 你有时间思考
No, I am happy that you have time

1887
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:14,330
有关宇宙与生存的问题 我很开心
to contemplate the universe and have existential problems...

1888
01:23:14,330 --> 01:23:17,050
因为我没有 我几乎没有时间思考
Because I don't. I barely have time to think.

1889
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:18,360
我上班 带孩子
I work, I babysit,

1890
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:20,340
- 上班 带孩子  - 你消停会行吗
- I work, I babysit.  - Could you hold on a second?

1891
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:22,520
我想上个厕所
I just have to tune up the string section.

1892
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:24,610
知道吗
You know what?

1893
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:26,660
在办公室我只有
The only time I get to think now

1894
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:28,150
拉屎的时间能思考
is when I take a shit at the office.

1895
01:23:28,150 --> 01:23:30,970
伴着屎味整理思绪
I'm starting to associate the thoughts with the smell of shit.

1896
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:34,050
这句话不错
That is a good line!

1897
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:35,610
我要把这话用在书里
I'm going to use that in a book someday.

1898
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:36,640
是啊 你一定会的
Yeah, I'm sure you will.

1899
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:38,450
这句话就是整本书最好的句子了
And that will be the best line in the book.

1900
01:23:38,870 --> 01:23:43,010
还有 不准再把我或我说过做过的
And by the way, you may never ever use me or anything I say or do

1901
01:23:43,010 --> 01:23:44,590
写进你那些书里了
in one of your fucking books again.

1902
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:46,600
女儿们的也不可以
and that goes for the girls, too.

1903
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,570
行
Okay.

1904
01:23:47,570 --> 01:23:49,530
那是你不该跟作家搞在一起的 对吧
You shouldn't have hooked up with a writer, alright?

1905
01:23:49,530 --> 01:23:52,230
我不会把你写进书里的
You weren't in the last book or the one I'm writing now.

1906
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:54,660
我他妈想写什么就写什么
See, I'm gonna write about whatever the fuck I want.

1907
01:23:55,370 --> 01:23:57,550
- 我们的生活还是你的素材  - 不不不
- As always, our life works for you.  - No, no, no.

1908
01:23:57,550 --> 01:24:00,580
别再那装受虐媳妇的丑样子
Don't give me this put-upon housewife bullshit.

1909
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:02,030
好吧 现在已经不是五十年代了
Ok? This is not the 50s.

1910
01:24:02,030 --> 01:24:05,170
抱歉打断你受压迫血泪史的激情讲述
I'm sorry to ruin your perfect little narrative of oppression.

1911
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:07,350
但事实上我才是
With the truth but I'm the one

1912
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:09,770
那个每天在家操心琐碎的人
who's at home every day dealing with the bullshit,

1913
01:24:09,770 --> 01:24:11,930
- 因为你六点半才下班  - 是六点
- Cause you are working till 6:30  - Six o'clock.

1914
01:24:11,930 --> 01:24:14,150
你送女儿去学校 我去接
You take the girls to school and I pick them up,

1915
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:16,100
这样很公平 是我们约定好的
that's fair, that's our deal.

1916
01:24:16,110 --> 01:24:20,090
- 天 我们可是住在法国巴黎  - 对
- We live in Paris, France, for Christ's sakes!  - Yeah.

- And you remind me of it every single day.  - I have orbited

1918
01:24:23,150 --> 01:24:25,900
都在围着你转 你知道的
my entire life around you and you know it.

1919
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:29,320
所以我很抱歉这个暑假 你的确是度假
Ok? So I'm sorry if this summer's vacation, and it is a vacation,

1920
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:31,490
因为我只看到你在海里玩耍
because all I've seen you do is frolic in the sea,

1921
01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:33,230
还有不停地吃希腊沙拉
and shove Greek salad down your throat.

1922
01:24:33,230 --> 01:24:36,020
但这些并不能说明你花了时间
Ok? But it's not indicative of you spending your life

1923
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:37,640
做家务
In some kind of domestic servitude.

1924
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,290
你知道我喜欢男人什么吗
You know what I love about men?

1925
01:24:39,290 --> 01:24:41,270
他们依旧相信有魔法

这没错
You are.

you take care of your friends, you take care of the world, alright?

1936
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:04,500
在你成为一个母亲之前就已经这样了
And you were like that before you were a mom,

1937
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,450
现在更是爱心泛滥
and now its only magnified, alright?

1938
01:25:06,450 --> 01:25:07,430
但是
But...

1939
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:09,420
这也是我这些年一直强调的
and I've been telling you this for years,

1940
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:10,990
你得对自己上点心了 好吗

关心下自己

你灵感一来就一直在写作

1961

Okay? But the truth is that I never wanted to hurt them once,

1982
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:14,030
但我想过很多次要为自己结束这种生活
but I thought about ending it all for myself a hundred times.

1983
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:18,020
我很彷徨 而你又因亨利抚养权这破事
I was so confused and you were always away on a stupid book tour

1984
01:27:18,030 --> 01:27:19,810
总是参加售书巡回活动
because of Henry's custody shit,

1985
01:27:19,810 --> 01:27:21,410
而我也不想跟你徒增烦恼
and I didn't want to be a burden.

1986
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:22,910
[西尔维娅·普雷：美国女诗人，于创作高峰时自杀]
现在我明白为何西尔维娅·普雷
Now I know why Sylvia Plath

1987
01:27:22,910 --> 01:27:24,420
把头放进烤面包器里
put her head in a toaster.

1988
01:27:24,670 --> 01:27:26,010
是烤箱
It was an oven.

1989
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:28,010
不要给我咬文嚼字 你知道我的意思
Don't play with words! You know what I mean.

1990
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:30,250
烤面包器 烤箱 都一个意思
Toaster, oven! Same thing.

1991
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:33,260
你知道有多少次我独自面对女儿们的哭泣吗
You know how many times I was alone with the girls crying?

1992
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:34,840
我完全不知道怎么办
With no clue what to do? Do you know

1993
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:37,250
你知道当一个母亲不知所措时她的负罪感吗
the guilt a mother feels when she doesn't know what to do?

1994
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:40,180
你以为只有你有这种感觉吗
Do you think you have sole ownership of that feeling?

1995
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:43,540
你根本不明白好吗
I don't think you understand, ok?

1996
01:27:43,590 --> 01:27:46,320
你知道我内心对男人恐惧的是什么吗
You know what my secret fear is with every man?

1997
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:50,040
是他们都想把我变成一个顺从的主妇
Is that they all want to turn me into a submissive housewife.

1998
01:27:50,350 --> 01:27:53,930
好吧 没人能那样做
Ok... no one could ever do that.

1999
01:27:53,930 --> 01:27:56,800
好吗 我保证
Alright? I promise it would be easier

2000
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,070
要让你顺从什么
to fit your head into a toaster.

2001
01:27:59,070 --> 01:28:01,540
还不如把你的头按进烤箱里更容易
than to turn you into anything submissive.

2002
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:04,580
我觉得我生育以后就没恢复过来
I don't think I recovered since giving birth.

2003
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:06,710
她们出生时我完全不知道怎么办
When they were born I had no idea of

2004
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:09,550
我…人们指望女人有天生的母性
what to do, I.... People expect women

2005
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:13,840
好像是突然冒出来的 就像母狒狒
to have this instinct that kicks in. Like a female baboon.

2006
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:16,760
但是我不知道该怎么做
But I had no idea how to do anything.

2007
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:21,200
我很爱她们 但我做什么都是错的
I love them so much and I was doing everything wrong.

2008
01:28:21,450 --> 01:28:23,620
你还总不在家
And you were away so often,

2009
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:26,030
打电话问我这一天过得怎么样
and calling me and asking me how my day went.

2010
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:27,810
我都不知道怎么和你说
I couldn't even say it to you

2011
01:28:27,810 --> 01:28:30,990
我觉得不知所措很丢人
because I felt so ashamed to be so clueless.

2012
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,480
- 我觉得你很棒  - 没有
- Look, I think you did great.  - No, I didn't.

2013
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:36,200
不 你很棒 起码假装得很棒
No, you did, well you did a good job faking it then.

2014
01:28:37,690 --> 01:28:38,840
我
I just ..

2015
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:40,910
我记得哄她们睡觉唯一的办法就是
I remember that the only way to get them to sleep

2016
01:28:40,910 --> 01:28:43,210
把笨重的双人婴儿车拖下楼
was to drag that stupid double

2017
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:46,700
在午夜几小时几小时的散步
stroller down the stairs and walk them for hours and hours

2018
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:49,390
走到皮加勒再返回来
in the middle of the night, all the way to Pigalle and back.

2019
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:51,510
我有一次差点被抢劫
I almost got mugged once, I mean,

2020
01:28:51,510 --> 01:28:53,230
那家伙放过我的唯一原因
the only reason why the guy didn't attack me

2021
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:55,230
是我看上去太惨了
was that I looked so pathetic.

2022
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:57,870
过了三十五岁的唯一好处
The only upside of being over 35

2023
01:28:57,870 --> 01:28:59,710
就是不用担心被强奸
is that you don't get raped as much.

2024
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:05,010
- 我看过这个说法 是真的  - 老天
- I read it, it's true.  - Oh Jesus.

2025
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:09,710
我记得我有一次
Once I remember that I was watching

2026
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,930
看到姐妹俩在跳蹦蹦床
the twins on the trampoline, you know,

2027
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:13,870
她们好漂亮
and they looked so beautiful

2028
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:17,170
我很开心因为她们开心
and I was happy because they were happy, you know.

2029
01:29:17,170 --> 01:29:18,540
其中一个用呼啦圈
And one of them had this...

2030
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:23,090
跳绳用的那个
Hulla-hoop that she was using as a jump rope, you know.

2031
01:29:23,090 --> 01:29:24,280
另一个也想
But then the other wanted it,

2032
01:29:24,290 --> 01:29:27,150
然后她们就打起来了
so they started fighting over it, you know.

2033
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:29,900
突然 被我看到了
And all of a sudden, I saw it all, you know.

2034
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:34,190
所有这些遗憾 嫉妒 自私
All this, pity and jealousy and selfishness, you know.

2035
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:41,050
我记得我当时就在想 好吧这就是普遍人性
And I remember thinking ... Ok, this is the natural human state

2036
01:29:41,570 --> 01:29:46,450
总是有点不满 永远不满足
Always a little dissatisfied, perpetually discontented, you know?

2037
01:29:46,710 --> 01:29:47,640
我是说
I mean...

2038
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:49,350
看看我们
Look at us.

2039
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:54,000
我们在这 在这伊甸园
Here we are, we are in... you know, The Garden of Eden.

2040
01:29:54,010 --> 01:29:55,660
但我们还在争吵
And we can not stop fighting.

2041
01:29:57,220 --> 01:29:59,950
我不认为人性只有一面
I do not think there is one natural human state.

2042
01:29:59,970 --> 01:30:01,240
而是多面的
The human state is multiple.

2043
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:02,190
我是说 如果你看到孩子们玩耍
I mean, if that's what

2044
01:30:02,190 --> 01:30:04,880
想到的是这个
you see when you're watching the girls play

2045
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,430
说明你很沮丧
that means you're depressed.

2046
01:30:08,250 --> 01:30:09,230
好吧
Ok...

2047
01:30:09,690 --> 01:30:13,690
- 可能是吧  - 我看到她们打架时
- Maybe I am.  - No. When I see them fight I see beautiful energy

2048
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:15,420
看到的是生命中前行的无穷力量
of going forward in life and not

2049
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:18,290
不让任何人踩在她们头上 夺走她们想要的
letting anyone step on them or take away what they want.

2050
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:21,330
我喜欢她们打架 这让我看到了希望
You know, I like it when they fight. It gives me hope for them.

2051
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:23,960
这是因为你把愤怒视作一种积极情绪
Well that's cause you see anger as a positive emotion, you know,

2052
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:27,800
最后只会伤害你自己 你的工作 孩子和我
and you only end up hurting yourself, your work, the kids, me.

2053
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,020
你从来不会生气吗
And you never get angry?

2054
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:34,500
我生气时不会把它视作积极情绪
When I do, I don't see it as a positive.

2055
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:38,410
你知道吗
You know something?

2056
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:43,860
你写的那些书 人们来找我
The way you write in your books, people come up to me

2057
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:47,650
[亨利·米勒：美国“垮掉派”作家]
以为我和那些鲁莽的亨利·米勒式的男人滚床单
and think that I make love to some wildcat Henry Miller type.

2058
01:30:49,930 --> 01:30:54,740
你滚床单的方式只有一种 每次都一样
You like to have sex the exact same way. Every time.

2059
01:30:54,810 --> 01:30:58,510
- 你说什么就是什么吧  - 亲亲 咪咪
- When you got it you got it  - Kissy, kissy, titty, titty

下面
Pussy...

2061

我是一个兴趣简单的男人
I am a man of simple pleasures.

2062
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:05,520
是的 非常简单
Yeah, very simple.

2063
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:08,280
我最近打算告诉你个事
And I've been meaning to tell you that lately.

2064
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:10,260
你不是亨利·米勒
You're no Henry Miller

2065
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:12,050
在任何方面
on any level.

2066
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:17,900
你知道吗 这房间让我浑身不自在
You know what? This room gives me the creeps.

2067
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:21,040
我本来希望有一点古典的 真正的希腊风
I was expecting something quaint, like the real Greece.

2068
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:21,610
这地方真的很…
This place is pretty real...

2069
01:31:21,610 --> 01:31:23,210
我们来这到底干嘛
What the hell are we doing here anyway?

2070
01:31:23,210 --> 01:31:24,300
全部都是安排好的
This is all too planned. Like,

2071
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:26,520
我们本该度过一个不错的夜晚
we are supposed to have this great evening.

2072
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:28,410
那种自然发生的
You know... there's no room for spontaneity.

2073
01:31:28,410 --> 01:31:30,210
离我们的生活远去了
It is all gone from our lives.

2074
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,290
对吗 这太蠢了 根本没用
Right? And this is stupid and it's not working.

2075
01:31:32,290 --> 01:31:33,590
好吧 显然是
Ok... well, obviously, right.

2076
01:31:33,590 --> 01:31:36,690
我诅咒阿里阿德涅和斯特凡诺斯搞这些
And I curse Ariadni and I curse Stefanos for doing this.

2077
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:40,000
好吧 夫妻按摩 这他妈的什么玩意儿
OK. a couples' massage?! What the fuck is that!?

2078
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,480
把我都拉廉价了
That sounds sleazy to me, right?

2079
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:44,340
我们没必要做啊
We don't have to do it!!! Ok?

2080
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:48,320
拜托 这地方还不错 我喜欢酒店房间
C'mon, this place isn't so bad. I like hotel rooms.

2081

雷迪森·希尔顿先生
Mr. Radisson Hilton.

2084
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:03,030
我知道你在华盛顿开读书会
And I know that time

2085
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:05,400
发生的事
when you were doing that reading in Washington.

2086
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:09,420
那天晚上你手机凑巧坏了 多巧啊
When your cellphone supposedly broke that night. How convenient!

2087
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:11,680
你以我们的孩子发誓
You swore on our kids

2088
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:13,990
你没有上书店店员
that you didn't fuck that lady from the bookstore,

2089
01:32:13,990 --> 01:32:15,030
艾米丽
Emily.

2090
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:17,930
对我发誓你没上什么艾米丽
Swear to me that you didn't fuck that Emily girl.

2091
01:32:17,930 --> 01:32:20,610
我不是嫉妒 我也不是那种人
And I'm not jealous because I'm not the jealous type

2092
01:32:20,610 --> 01:32:24,420
我只想知道真相 像个男人勇于承认好吗
But I just want to know is. OK? Be a man and admit the truth!

2093
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:31,610
我给了你我的一生 我没别的可给了
I'm giving you my whole life, ok? I got nothing larger to give.

2094
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:34,250
我没有给别人一生
I'm not giving it to anybody else.

2095
01:32:35,410 --> 01:32:38,520
如果你想否定我
If you're looking for permission to disqualify me,

2096
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:40,540
我不会允许的
I'm not gonna give it to you.

2097
01:32:41,030 --> 01:32:43,740
我爱你
Ok? I love you.

2098
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:48,690
我不想吵架
And I am not in conflict about it, Ok?

2099
01:32:48,690 --> 01:32:51,670
如果你想像列洗衣清单一样
But if what you want is like a laundry list of all the

2100
01:32:51,670 --> 01:32:54,460
听我列数你的过错 我奉陪
things about you that piss me off, I can give it to you.

2101
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:55,480
我想听
Yeah. I want you to hear ...

2102

Ok, well ...

超过六个月
for more than like six months.

但是我 照单全收
But I accept the whole package.

2109

疯狂的你 聪明的你
The crazy and the brilliant, right?

2110

我知道你不会改变 也不想你改变
I know you're not gonna change and I don't want you to.

2111
01:33:14,670 --> 01:33:17,130
这就叫“接受你本来的样子”
It's called accepting you for being you.

2112
01:33:17,170 --> 01:33:19,450
好吧 我问你
Yeah, OK. I asked you a question,

2113
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:22,540
如果我拖着婴儿车下楼
if while I was carrying that double stroller down the stairs,

2114
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:24,410
在皮加勒被人强奸了
and getting ass-raped in Pigalle

2115
01:33:24,410 --> 01:33:26,680
你是不是在上什么艾米丽·勃朗特
Did you fuck that little Emily Bronte girl ?

2116
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:28,780
我不知道什么艾米丽
Ok... I don't what Em...What Emily,

2117
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:29,980
不知道你在说什么
what are you even talking about?

2118
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:32,580
那个写邮件给你聊陀思妥耶夫斯基的人
The one that wrote the nice emails about Dostoyevsky.

2119
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:35,090
杰西 你说得对
Oh Jesse, you're so right!

2120
01:33:35,090 --> 01:33:37,820
大司令官是俄语文学里
The grand commander is the deepest passage

2121
01:33:37,820 --> 01:33:39,500
根植的传统
of all of Russian literature.

2122
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:44,280
如果你问我是否有履行对你 对女儿们
If you are asking me if I'm committed to you, the girls,

2123
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:49,700
和我们共建的生活的承诺 答案是有
and the life we built together, the answer is a resounding yes.

2124
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:53,080
所以你的确上了她 多谢
So you did fuck her, thank you very much.

2125
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:55,760
你前男友母亲去世之后 你去看他
Do I ever ask you about the time you went to visit

2126
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:57,730
我有问过你吗
your old boyfriend after his mother died?

2127
01:33:57,730 --> 01:33:58,780
没有 你知道为什么吗
No. You want to know why?

2128
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:01,730
因为我知道你那法国屁股干的事
Because I know the way that your fucking French ass works.

2129
01:34:01,730 --> 01:34:04,510
我敢说你至少给那家伙吹箫了
And I guarantee that at least you blew that guy.

2130
01:34:04,510 --> 01:34:06,430
但是我也知道你爱我
But I also know that you love me.

2131
01:34:06,430 --> 01:34:09,550
我无所谓你复杂的人性
All right? And I'm OK with you being a complicated human being.

2132
01:34:09,550 --> 01:34:11,910
我不想过无趣的生活
I don't want to live a boring life

2133
01:34:11,910 --> 01:34:13,870
两个人只属于对方
where two people own each other,

2134
01:34:13,870 --> 01:34:16,080
囿于别人创建的
where two people are institutionalized

2135
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:17,990
条条框框里
in a box that others created,

2136
01:34:17,990 --> 01:34:21,320
因为那都是胡说八道
because that is a bunch of stifling bullshit!

2137
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:41,720
你知道怎么了吗
You know what's going on here?

2138
01:34:41,950 --> 01:34:42,900
很简单
It's simple.

2139
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:46,970
我想我不再爱你了
I don't think I love you any more.

2140
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:03,780
- 听着  - 我现在不想讲话
- Listen.  - I don't want to talk right now.

2141
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:05,910
你一个人吗 还是在等某个人
Are you by yourself? Are you waiting for somebody?

2142
01:36:05,910 --> 01:36:08,510
是 我一个人 我乐意 我现在很生气
Yeah. I'm by myself and happy to be. I'm an angry person,

2143
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:10,790
我伤害了我的孩子 工作 我爱的人
and I hurt my kids, my work and everyone I love.

2144
01:36:10,790 --> 01:36:13,320
那正是我的菜
Oh ... you're just my type.

2145
01:36:14,170 --> 01:36:16,740
我没心情 我来这就是想静静
Ok... I'm not in the mood. I came here to be alone.

2146
01:36:16,740 --> 01:36:19,590
我从那边咖啡店过来就在注意你了
Listen. I've been checking you out from across the cafe?

2147
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:21,220
我不想惹你不适
And I don't want to make you uncomfortable

2148
01:36:21,220 --> 01:36:23,430
但是你是这附近
But you are by far the best-looking

2149
01:36:23,450 --> 01:36:25,500
- 最漂亮的女人  - 谢谢
- woman in this place.  - Thank you very much.

2150
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:27,310
我想请你喝一杯
Yes, I'd love to buy a drink

2151
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:30,130
随便聊聊 多了解你一点
or maybe talk to you, get to know you a little bit, you know.

2152
01:36:30,130 --> 01:36:31,530
你是来出差吗
Are you here on business?

2153
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:35,140
你有男朋友
Ok, so you have a boyfriend.

2154
01:36:35,910 --> 01:36:36,960
现在没了
Not any more.

2155
01:36:37,870 --> 01:36:40,650
抱歉 你想谈谈吗
I'm sorry to hear that, God, you want to talk about it?

2156
01:36:41,050 --> 01:36:42,340
我不和陌生人讲话
I don't talk to strangers.

2157
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:44,240
原来如此 我不是陌生人啊
Well that's the thing, I'm not a stranger.

2158
01:36:44,290 --> 01:36:48,860
我们以前见过 九四年夏天
We've met before... In the summer of 94?

2159
01:36:51,570 --> 01:36:53,170
你认错人了
You're mistaking me for someone else.

2160
01:36:53,170 --> 01:36:54,150
没有
No.

2161
01:36:54,510 --> 01:36:57,130
- 我们还坠入爱河了  - 是吗
- We even fell in love.  - Really?

2162
01:36:59,010 --> 01:37:02,100
我依稀记得有个人 甜蜜又浪漫
Hm, I vaguely remember someone sweet and romantic

2163
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:05,030
让我觉得自己不再是孤身一人
that made me feel like I wasn't alone any more,

2164
01:37:05,030 --> 01:37:07,010
尊重我本来的样子
someone who had respect for who I was.

2165
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:08,580
就是我
That's me.

2166
01:37:08,930 --> 01:37:12,220
- 我就是那个人  - 我想不是
- I'm that guy  - I don't think so.

2167
01:37:12,830 --> 01:37:15,000
我知道今晚一些你不知道的事
See? I know something about tonight that you do not know.

2168
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:19,890
- 是吗 什么  - 很重要
- Really? What is that?  - Something important.

2169
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,480
我知道是因为
You see, I know because

2170
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:26,020
我已经度过今晚了
I've actually already lived through this night.

2171
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:27,350
怎么做到的
How?

2172
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:28,820
我是时光旅行者
I'm a time traveller.

2173
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:31,670
好吧
Ok...

2174
01:37:31,670 --> 01:37:33,850
我房间有台时光机
I have time machine up in my room, and

2175
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:36,710
我来拯救你 就像我说过的那样
I've come to save you just like I said I would.

2176
01:37:36,780 --> 01:37:38,420
- 拯救我什么  - 拯救你被胡言乱语
- Save me from what?  - Save you from

2177
01:37:38,430 --> 01:37:40,770
蒙蔽的双眼
being blinded by all the little bullshit, alright?

2178
01:37:40,770 --> 01:37:44,090
- 那不是胡言乱语  - 我确定那个你依稀记得的
- It's not bullshit.  - I assure you that guy

2179
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:46,070
火车里偶遇的
you vaguely remember the sweet, romantic one

2180
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:47,460
那个甜蜜浪漫的人
that you met on the train,

2181
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:50,460
就是我
that is me.

2182
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:52,980
- 是你吗  - 是
- That's you?  - Yeah.

2183
01:37:53,210 --> 01:37:54,790
我想我没认出来
I guess I didn't recognize you.

2184
01:37:56,610 --> 01:37:57,870
你看上去一团糟
You look like shit.

2185
01:37:59,690 --> 01:38:00,690
怎么说呢
Well what can I say?

2186
01:38:00,690 --> 01:38:03,030
时空穿梭太辛苦
I mean it's tough out there in time and space.

2187
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:08,660
你正好相反 比我记忆里更漂亮了
You... on the other hand, are even more beautiful than I remember.

2188
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:11,130
胡言乱语
Bullshit.

2189
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:13,250
杰西 这不是游戏
Jesse, this is not a game.

2190
01:38:13,450 --> 01:38:15,400
你装可爱 哄我上床
You get all cute. You get in my panties.

2191
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:18,280
接下来我知道我就要在芝加哥买花生酱了
And next thing I know I'm buying peanut butter in Chicago.

2192
01:38:18,450 --> 01:38:20,780
你这样搭讪是没用的
You're not gonna make it better by some little pick-up line.

2193
01:38:20,780 --> 01:38:22,320
不 我不是在搭讪你
No, I'm not trying to pick you up...

2194
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:23,840
不 你误会我了
No no, you are misunderstanding me.

2195
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:26,540
我是来是送信的
No, no... I'm only here as a messenger.

2196
01:38:26,970 --> 01:38:29,850
我来自未来
I just traveled all the way from the future,

2197
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:34,590
我遇到八十二岁的你
I was just with your 82-year-old self

2198
01:38:34,890 --> 01:38:38,610
她让我把这封信读给你听
who gave me a letter to read to you.

2199
01:38:38,610 --> 01:38:41,930
- 所以我来了  - 我八十岁还活着
- So here I am.  - I'm still alive in my 80s?

2200
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:43,960
是啊
Oh, yeah.

2201
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:49,420
- 我的法国屁股呢  - 非常棒
- How's my French ass?  - Nice, really nice.

2202
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:50,940
我无所谓我变成什么样了
I don't care about the way I look.

2203
01:38:50,950 --> 01:38:53,000
比现在的你更惹人爱
Let's just say there is more of you to love...

2204
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,510
好吧
Ok, great.

2205
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:57,230
- 你想我读给你听吗  - 我还有选择吗
- Do you want me to read it to you?  - Do I have a choice?

2206
01:38:57,230 --> 01:38:59,110
当然 如果你不感兴趣
Sure. I mean, if you're not interested in...

2207
01:38:59,110 --> 01:39:01,250
不不不 读吧
No, no, no. Read it.

2208
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:05,390
好吧 听好了 亲爱的瑟琳
OK. Here it is: Dear Celine,

2209
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:09,340
我从森林另一边给你写信
I am writing to you from the other side of the woods.

2210
01:39:09,410 --> 01:39:11,630
这封信会点燃
This letter is lighting a candle...

2211
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:14,260
够了 我不会写这个的 太花哨
OK, stop it. I would never write this, too flowery,

2212
01:39:14,260 --> 01:39:15,860
“森林另一边” 什么森林
"Other side of the woods"? What fucking woods?

2213
01:39:15,860 --> 01:39:18,020
- 你在说什么  - 我可以继续吗
- What are you talking about?  - May I please continue?

2214
01:39:18,180 --> 01:39:19,070
好吧
Ok...

2215
01:39:19,230 --> 01:39:22,190
我把这个年轻人派去你身边
I'm sending you this young man,

2216
01:39:22,310 --> 01:39:24,100
是的 年轻人
yes, young.

2217
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:26,360
他会是你的护卫
And he will be your escort.

2218
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:29,200
天晓得他有多少毛病
God knows he has many problems

2219
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:32,580
他终其一生都在
and he's struggled his whole life connecting

2220
01:39:32,590 --> 01:39:37,060
努力亲近陪伴他最爱的人
and being present, even with those he loves the most.

2221
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:39,500
对此 他万分抱歉
And, for that, he is deeply sorry.

2222
01:39:41,260 --> 01:39:43,210
但是你是他唯一的希望
But you are his only hope.

2223
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:45,800
瑟琳
Celine,

2224
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:48,430
我对你的建议是
my advice to you is this:

2225
01:39:49,390 --> 01:39:51,740
你已经进入人生中最美好的年华
You're entering the best years of your life.

2226
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:54,760
从我这个年纪回望过去
Looking back from where I sit now,

2227
01:39:55,890 --> 01:39:59,330
这段中年岁月仅比你十二岁和马修·瓦内萨
these middle years are only a little bit more difficult

2228
01:39:59,330 --> 01:40:03,920
彻夜欢跳比吉斯的“你的爱有多深”
than when you were 12 and Matthew and Vanessa

2229
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:08,220
要艰难一些
danced all night to the Bee Gees' "How deep is your love".

2230
01:40:08,270 --> 01:40:09,430
我不知道是什么
I don't know what that...

2231
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:12,380
算了 瑟琳 你会没事的
Anyway... Celine, you will be fine,

2232
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:15,360
你的女儿们会成长为
your girls will grow up to become examples

2233
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:18,350
- 女权运动的典范  - 不错
- and icons of feminism.  - Nice one.

2234
01:40:18,390 --> 01:40:20,050
是啊 我刚注意到
Yeah. Well you know I just noticed that

2235
01:40:20,050 --> 01:40:23,030
底下有一段附言
there's a postscript on the bottom.

2236
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:25,160
也许我应该跳过 这些太无聊了
Maybe I just skip over, some of this is kind of boring...

2237
01:40:25,170 --> 01:40:26,590
好的 跳过 跳过
Yes. Skip away, please, skip away.

2238
01:40:26,590 --> 01:40:27,980
- 你确定  - 是
- Ok... you sure?  - Yeah!

2239
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:30,710
- 好的  - 絮絮叨叨的
- Alright, well...  - Boring stuff.

2240
01:40:30,710 --> 01:40:33,540
好的 下面就是说什么
Ok... yeah, it's like blah blah blah,

2241
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:36,960
经济注意事项啦 星座啦
