4
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,670
这是一个关于过去…
This is a story of the past...

5
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,270
和未来的故事
and the future.

6
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,410
我们将走向未来 但首先 我们会经历过去
We will come to the future, but first, the past.

7
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,280
这是沃里克伯爵
Here we have the Earl of Warwick.

8
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,760
从他的表情可以看出
We can see by his petulantly arched brow...

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,420
他肯定不是在干好事情
that he is not enroute to a good deed.

10
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,250
来吧
Obey!

11
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,080
魔法
Enchanted...

12
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,220
你还想活吗 老巫婆？
Do you wish to live, old witch?

13
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,090
你已经违背了王国的法律
You have committed grave crimes...

14
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,650
违背了上帝和国王
against God and your king, have you not?

15
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,890
- 饶恕我吧  - 安静
- Have mercy, my lord.  - Silence.

16
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,890
那个法国人 康德·瑟伯特
The Frenchman Count Thibault of Malfete...

17
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,800
将要娶国王的女儿 罗莎琳德公主
shall wed Lady Rosalind, the daughter of our king.

18
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,590
我要那个女人
I desire that woman.

19
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,160
我要得到那个女人
I alone am fit to take her hand.

20
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:42,140
还有她的城堡 她的土地和财产…
And her castle, lands, the riches that are her dowry.

21
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,980
你还不笨啊 老巫婆
Thou art not as stupid as thou art hideous, old hag.

22
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,070
明天晚上
Tomorrow night...

23
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,310
国王将会盛情款待康德
the king shall feast the arrival of the count.

24
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,090
在宴会结束前 我要他永远在我眼前消失
I want the count dead before the feast is over.

25
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,750
这儿有一小袋金子
A small fortune in gold...

26
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,320
是给替我办事的人预备的
awaits the sorceress who doth my bidding.

27
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,690
别急
Not so fast.

28
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:05,000
我怎么知道 你有能力完成这个任务？
How shall I know thy magic is sufficient to the task?

29
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,300
这个还不够吗？
Does thou find proof enough in this?

30
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,560
我相信你能做到！
That will do!

31
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,660
拿走！
Take it,witch!

32
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,740
这个足够证明了吧 我的伯爵？
Was that proof enough, my lord?

33
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,540
明晚来国王的城堡
Come to the king's castle tomorrow night...

34
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,980
并执行我的计划
and carry out my plan.

35
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,710
如果你失败了 你会死的很难看的
If you fail... you will be burned.

36
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,620
我们的英雄 当然对这些一无所知
Our hero, of course, knew none of this.

37
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,490
他很安全 跟着他的护卫队
He was safely in his entourage...

38
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,160
在去婚宴的途中
traveling, he thought, to his wedding.

39
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,220
这就是他 康德·瑟伯特
Here he is... the Count of Malfete.

40
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,100
他也是一位公爵 一位男爵和一位贵族
He is also a duke, a baron, and a lord.

41
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,770
一位贵族 却经常被一些小事烦恼
A nobleman, plagued by only those small things...

42
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,640
一位骑士的苦恼
which inconvenience a knight...

43
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,080
永远都得跟着 他的妹妹
the permanent presence of his sisters...

44
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,240
他的母亲 父亲
his mother and father...

45
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,580
并且跟所有的骑士一样 都得学会忍耐
and, as all knights must endure...

46
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,450
一个愚蠢的仆人 安德鲁
an idiot servant, Andre...

47
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,080
他的气味实在是难闻
whose smell made people faint...

48
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,710
他保持了一个记录
a considerable achievement...

49
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,620
从来不洗澡
among a population who never bathed.

50
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,950
下去 乡巴佬！
Down, peasant!

51
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,390
公爵 或者叫瑟伯特
The duke, or Thibault...

52
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,430
虽然说出于他的身份 我们不能这么称呼他
as his subjects were not allowed to call him...

53
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,660
十分的高兴
was joyous.

54
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,800
期待已久的一天
The long-awaited day of his marriage...

55
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,070
终于到来了
had come at last.

56
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,100
看看这是谁来了？
What have we got here?

57
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,540
又一对野蛮的皇家卫队？
Another lot of bloody royal bastards?

58
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,010
一定是那个法国公爵
Must be that French duke...

59
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,670
来娶国王的女儿
come to marry the king's daughter.

60
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,680
当心森林！
Mind the forest!

61
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,580
那有可怕的恶龙
There be dragons who'll make dinner...

62
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,350
它会把你当点心！
from your bones in there!

63
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,450
安德鲁 效忠于他的主人
Andre loved and protected his master.

64
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,580
主人！主人！
Master! Master!

65
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,590
这个森林…闹鬼！
The forest...it is haunted!

66
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,560
瑟伯特没有理会他
Thibault responded.

67
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,690
多谢 主人
Thankyou,master.

68
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,170
一步一步
With every step...

69
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,500
他越来越接近了他的爱人
he came closer to the castle of his beloved.

70
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,480
他希望立刻就能见到她
He hoped he would be with her soon...

71
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,770
但在旅程中
for rare was the journey in which Thibault...

72
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,680
他们其实并没有必要停下来
did not have to stop and rescue someone.

73
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,080
这并不是意外
This was no exception...

74
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,280
就象他的祖先
For like his ancestors...

75
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,650
他生活在一个 传统的家庭中
he lived by an ancient family rule...

76
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,450
那个女人在危难中！
A woman in distress!

77
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,960
他所知道的是
The only one he knew.

78
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,820
小心 主人
Beware, sire.

79
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,630
勇气更多于责任
Courage was more than a duty.

80
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,260
他坚信他的勇气
Courage was his creed.

81
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,950
安德鲁！快去帮你主人！
Andre! Join your master!

82
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,220
我在和你说话呢！快去！笨蛋！
I'm talking to you! Go, go! Stupid peasant!

83
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,790
主人！小心后边！
Sire! Behind you!

84
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,110
自然的
Naturally...

85
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,570
勇猛无敌！
Courage is our creed!

86
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,240
他是无敌的
He was invincible.

87
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,080
但他并不是无敌的
Except he was not invincible...

88
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,910
和魔法作对
against witchcraft.

89
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,580
这将是他最后一个胜利
For this would be his last victory...

90
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,950
在这一千年中
in this millennium.

91
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,720
下午好
Afternoon,sir.

92
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,220
我听说
I hear a rumor...

93
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,750
你明天要结婚了 我的公爵
thou art marrying tomorrow, my lord.

94
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,430
我也听说了
I have heard this rumor.

95
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,960
我还听说
I have also heard...

96
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,270
新娘是英格兰最漂亮的姑娘
the bride is the most beautiful in all of England.

97
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,640
但这并不是真的
But it is not true.

98
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,610
- 不是真的？ - 不是
- It is not?  - No.

99
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,480
难道我不是
Am I not the most beautiful bride...

100
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,380
英格兰最漂亮的？
in all of England?

101
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,180
不 等等
No. Wait.

102
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,680
你是最漂亮的
The most beautiful bride...

103
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,410
在全世界
in all the world.

104
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,860
戴上这个 瑟伯特
Wear this for me, Thibault.

105
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,370
把它和你的心放在一起
Wear it against thine heart.

106
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,930
你以后要老实点
Thou shalt always be true.

107
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,100
罗莎琳德小姐
Lady Rosalind.

108
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,200
别在结婚之前
Thou shalt not disgrace thyself...

109
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,580
想过分的事情
before the wedding.

110
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,370
我要去为晚宴做准备了
I must hide and dress for the banquet.

111
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,340
主人 你的新娘 看起来象华丽的麻雀
Sire, your bride looks like a gorgeous sparrow.

112
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,510
闭嘴 你这个无理的乡巴佬
Silence, you impudent peasant.

113
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,910
在你未来的女主人面前 要懂得尊重
Show respect to your future mistress.

114
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,750
是的 主人
Yes, master.

115
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,580
哦！谢谢 公爵
Ah! Thank you, my lord.

116
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,440
当心
Quite so, Your Majesty.

117
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,620
当我们的公主 喝了杯子中的酒
When our lady drinks her wine...

118
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,120
她的眼中会出现幻觉
her eyes will fill with hellish visions.

119
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,780
在她眼中康德将会 变成一头怪物
The count will appear as a hideous beast.

120
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,890
然后我的魔力将会迫使她 把她自己的丈夫杀死 哈哈哈
Then my magic will compel her to kill him. Hahaha.

121
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,530
各位来宾
My dear friends and noble guests.

122
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,560
瑟伯特 玛非特伯爵
Thibault, Count of Malfete and Papincourt...

123
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,200
我宣布 这个城堡将是我送给我女儿的礼物
I hereby declare this castle a wedding present.

124
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,650
陛下 我会尽我所能
Your Majesty, in every way that I am able...

125
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,840
照顾我的漂亮爱人
I will serve my beautiful lady...

126
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,370
并对你的王国表示尊敬
and do honor to thy kingdom.

127
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,320
喝完这杯 我们就是夫妻了
Drink of my cup... and you will know my thoughts.

128
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,450
我也是
And thou will know mine.

129
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,170
亲爱的？
My lord?

130
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,140
- 哦！ - 瑟伯特！
- Uhh!  - Thibault!

131
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,810
亲爱的！
My lord!

132
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,160
怎么了 瑟伯特？
What is it, Thibault?

133
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,760
这不大正常
This is not the kind of behavior...

134
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,770
你怎么了 儿子？
What is happening to you, my son?

135
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,360
你醉了？
Are you crazy? Drunk?

136
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,700
瑟伯特 伯爵 你别发疯了
Count Thibault, this is no way to behave...

137
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,370
在一个英国皇宫！
in an English court!

138
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,930
都是魔鬼！
Beasts from Hell!

139
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,110
哦！这是我妈！
Ohh! That is my mother!

140
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,880
瑟伯特 这是我妈！
Thibault, that is my mother!

141
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,310
魔鬼！
Demon!

142
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,120
哦 不！
Oh, no!

143
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,300
我都干什么了？
No! What have I done?

144
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,790
不是我干的 是魔力！
It is not me. It is witchcraft!

145
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,530
安德鲁 帮我找一个巫师！
Andre, find me a wizard!

146
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,670
法国会得到应有的惩罚的
France must pay for this treachery.

147
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,910
帮我找一个巫师！
Find me a wizard!

148
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,080
饶恕可怜的人吧
Have pity on a poor condemned man.

149
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,220
我们来进行最后的祈祷
We are here for the last rites.

150
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,440
主人！我们得抓紧时间
My lord! We have to hurry.

151
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,500
我要的巫师就是这个？
Whatwizard is this?

152
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:16,010
他是英国人 我的主人 但他的法力很高深
He's English, my lord. But his magic is very good.

153
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,320
是你们邪恶的沃里克伯爵干的
Your bloody Earl of Warwick did this to me.

154
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,120
没错
Indeed he did.

155
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,360
同样他也会对付我 如果他知道我在这帮你们
And he'd have me, too, if he knew that I was here.

156
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,450
我求你了 他可以救你
I beg you, my sire. Let him save you.

157
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,190
你能让我的妻子起死回生吗？
Can you bring my lady back from the dead?

158
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,100
我能使她的尸体复活
I can reanimate her corpse...

159
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,800
如果你介意
but I don't think that my lord...

160
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,740
她的样子或者味道
would like the way she looks... or smells.

161
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,940
但还有另外一个办法
There is another way.

162
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,350
时间就象山脉一样
Time is like a mountain.

163
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,690
穿梭于隧道之间
Riddled with tunnels.

164
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,820
我能开启时间隧道
I can open one of these tunnels for thee...

165
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,590
并把你带回到出事之前
and return thee to the moment before the murder.

166
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,560
如果你足够强壮的话
If thy will is strong enough.

167
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,410
你们不认为这个牧师 在里边呆太久了吗？
Don't you think this priest has had enough time?

168
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,230
快点
Hurry up, Father.

169
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,780
开门！
Unlock this door!Now!

170
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,380
把这个给喝下去
Drink this potion, my lord...

171
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:30,450
你将会进入时间隧道
and thou shalt descend into the Mountain of Time.

172
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,330
哦！好难闻
Ohh! It smells awful.

173
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,850
你不能喝这个
You should not drink that.

174
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,990
假如你变成别的怪物了呢？
What if you become a frog, or goat's feet?

175
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,060
你说的没错
You are right.

176
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,970
你先喝
Drink first, bastard.

177
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,460
如果你死了 我会为你报仇的
And if you die, I will avenge your death.

178
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,670
你们在干吗？
What are you doingin there?

179
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,980
开门！
Open this door!

180
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,520
开门！
Open this door!

181
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,920
这个闻起来象狗屎
It tastes like the shit of the pork.

182
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,360
他应该知道
And he should know.

183
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,530
每一分 每一
Per Horus et per Ra...

184
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,000
我忘记这个蛋了
I forgot the grouse eggs.

185
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,510
哦 天啊
Oh, it's a disaster.

186
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,000
我在时间隧道丢失了他们
I've lost them in the corridors of Time.

187
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,950
开门！开门！
Open this door! Open this door!

188
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,970
哦！好酷
Wow. Cool!

189
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,100
好酷啊
This is cool.

190
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,510
这的确很不错 仔细看！
This is pretty cool,yeah. Look at them!

191
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,540
看见这个农夫 躺在地板上了吗？
See the peasant sleeping on the floor?

192
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,550
在那个年代 人们从来不认为
In those days, people didn't think...

193
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,780
一个农夫该有好的待遇
that peasants deserved any better than that...

194
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,280
并且他们忠实于自己的主人
and they were considered the property of their masters.

195
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,220
看 这个农夫的主人是个骑士
Now, the boss of this peasant is the knight.

196
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,420
看见这个骑士漂亮的衣服了吗？
See how beautiful the knight's clothing is?

197
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,660
老师 他还热乎呢 刚才还喘气了！
Miss Rodett, that one is hot, and it just snorted!

198
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,930
那是不可能的
Now, Tammy, that's impossible...

199
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,460
因为它们仅仅是模型
because they're just mannequins...

200
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,130
模型并不会喘气
and mannequins don't snort.

201
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,830
但是他刚才的确动了
Well, that one just did.

202
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,310
不可能 他们是假的
No, because they're not real.

203
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,440
他们看起来就象 玩具
They're just like... dolls.

204
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,210
啊 见鬼！
Aaah! Oh, shit!

205
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,950
你在我房间干吗？
What are you doing in my chamber?

206
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,370
你的房间
Your chamber...

207
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,130
已经被劈成两半
has been cleaved in half, my lord.

208
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,000
这已经不是城堡了！
This is notthe castle!

209
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,440
什么？
What?

210
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,510
看这个 主人！
Oh, look at this, my sire!

211
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,350
这是恶魔！
It is Satanic!

212
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,520
这里是地狱 我们是被判有罪的人
This is Hell, and we are condemned souls.

213
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,720
走 我们应该找到这 阴间的王子
Come. We shall find the prince of this netherworld...

214
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,360
让他可怜我们
and beg his mercy.

215
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,170
等等 我的主人！
Wait for me, my lord!

216
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,630
先生 快点
Dr. Brady, come quick.

217
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,400
两个带着剑的人
Two guys with swords and armor...

218
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,880
米勒 你过于紧张了
Miller, you're always over reacting.

219
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,810
放松点
Now, relax.

220
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,650
没有必要去
There's absolutely no need to...

221
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,350
警察已经来了
Police are on their way.

222
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,350
乡巴佬
Peasant, please.

223
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,360
告诉我怎么走出这个城堡！
Show me the way out of this prince castle!

224
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,520
是的！
Yes!

225
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,390
- 他们好臭！ - 祝你愉快
- They stink!  - Have a nice day.

226
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,490
- 好运  - 等等！
- Bye. Good luck.  - Wait!

227
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,600
乡巴佬！等等！
Peasant! Wait! Stop!

228
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,860
这是什么？地狱之门！
What is this? The Gates of Hell!

229
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,570
看这这个火眼！
Look at its eyes of fire!

230
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,870
恶龙！恶龙！
Dragon! It's a red dragon!

231
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,030
进攻！
Attack!

232
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,630
你到底在干吗？
What the hell are you doing?

233
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,740
尝尝吧 恶魔！
Take that, beast!

234
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,730
我们把它干了！
We have killed it!

235
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,900
没错 它已经没有呼吸了
Ah,yes. It is no longer breathing.

236
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,350
上帝在跟我们开玩笑
God is punishing us for practicing the BlackArts.

237
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,280
让我们请求饶恕吧
Let us pray for forgiveness.

238
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,120
上帝啊 饶恕我们吧
Heavenly Father, forgive us our sins.

239
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,490
我们实在 实在 实在是 抱歉
We are so, so, so, so, so...so sorry.

240
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,630
先生？
Dr. Brady?

241
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,930
哦 朱丽娅 这是朱丽娅
Ah,Julia. This is Julia Malfete...

242
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,000
她是这次活动的发起人
who heads up the Medieval Art department.

243
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,600
她捐赠了这个十二世纪的古堡
She donated the famous 12th century castle exhibit.

244
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,610
那两个人所在的展区 也是朱丽娅策划的
Julia designed the exhibit where we found the two men.

245
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,940
这些是从他们身上搜到的
That stuff right there is the result of the body search.

246
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,010
那个大块头有金币
The big guy had the gold coins...

247
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,780
剑 盾牌 还有那个戒指
the sword,the shield, and that ring.

248
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,410
那个矮子有些腌肉
The little guy had the salt pork...

249
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,790
肉肠 匕首
the sausage,the dagger...

250
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,520
还有一颗牙骨
a molar.

251
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,690
还有那个盒子 我想是他偷的
And that box... which he probably stole.

252
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,390
应该不是从我们这偷的
Not from us.

253
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,200
大多数小偷都偷值钱的东西
Most thieves take valuable things.

254
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,000
而不是把之前的拿进来
They usually don't bring them.

255
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,670
这是一个歌特式的盒子
This is a Gothic pixis...

256
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,140
从样式看应该是 坎特伯雷出产的
the kind of design they were making in Canterbury...

257
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,400
在十二世纪末
at the end of the 12th century.

258
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,410
这上边有翡翠和红宝石
It has emeralds and rubies.

259
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,740
那两个人怎么会睡在那里？
Why did the two men sleep here?

260
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,250
他们可以去住宾馆
They could've booked a suite at the Ritz.

261
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,310
你确定这是从他们身上搜到的？
So, you said that you got these out of their pockets?

262
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,650
没错
That's right.

263
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,880
除了这串腊肠
Except the sausage.

264
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,590
这个戒指的样子看着很奇怪
This stamp ring is fantastic.

265
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,760
我是家族的族徽
My family's coat of arms.

266
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,100
能带我去见那两个小偷吗？
Sergeant, can I meet these thieves?

267
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,240
主人 我好饿
Master, I'm hungry.

268
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,070
我的肚子在咕咕叫
My tummy rumbles like a beast.

269
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,300
这时候你还有心情想到吃？
How can you think of food after such tragedy?

270
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,540
遵命
Yes.

271
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,540
我希望我还有机会 能再见我的爱人
What I would not give to see once more my precious...

272
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,380
主人！看 她还活着！
My lord! Look, she's alive!

273
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,280
罗莎琳德！亲爱的罗莎琳德
Rosalind. My fair Rosalind.

274
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,020
你还活着！罗莎琳德！
My bride. My ravishing flower.

275
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,150
主人！主人！
Mistress! My mistress!

276
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,390
你在干吗？
What are you doing?

277
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,790
这是一个奇迹 绝对是一个奇迹
It is amiracle. A miracle.

278
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,060
我认识你吗？
Do I know you?

279
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,160
难道你不认识我了吗？
Do you not recognize me, my lady?

280
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,030
我是瑟伯特伯爵
I am the Count of Malfete and Papincourt...

281
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,230
安德拉伯爵
the Duke of Anjou.

282
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,600
我是你忠实的瑟伯特啊
I am your faithful Thibault.

283
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,110
你说你是谁？
You're who?

284
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:04,370
我是安德鲁 伯爵的仆人
And I am Andre le Pate, valet of the count.

285
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,210
请饶恕我以前对你做的一切
Please, forgive me for what I did to you...

286
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,310
我亲爱的罗莎琳德
my dear Rosalind.

287
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:12,450
我是朱丽娅 并不是你说的罗莎琳德
My name isn't Rosalind. It's Julia.

288
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,180
不！你就是我的罗莎琳德
No! You are my Rosalind.

289
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,920
这是你给我的定情信物
The lock of hair you gave me on our wedding day.

290
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,590
我一直把他戴在身边
I carry it over my heart.

291
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,960
亲爱的 你自己自己看看吧
Please, my love, see for your self.

292
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,770
你也看见了？
You see?

293
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,260
这是盛夏中小麦的颜色
It is the color of wheat on a summer's day.

294
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,500
就象烛光
The color of candle light.

295
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,110
这就是你
It is your own.

296
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,910
停下！
Stop this!

297
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,610
- 够了！ - 罗莎琳德！
- That's enough!  - Rosalind!

298
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,310
你们最好先出去！
You'll be safer outside!

299
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,020
别离开我！
Do not leave me! Do not be afraid!

300
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,420
你先出去
You don't want to see this.

301
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,420
勇者无敌！
Courage is our creed!

302
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,160
勇者无敌！
Courage is our creed!

303
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,690
别打了！我认识这个人！
Wait, stop! I know this man!

304
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,470
“勇者无敌”
"Courage is our creed."

305
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,300
这是我们家族的座右铭
That's our family motto.

306
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,310
这个人应该是我的表哥
This man is my cousin.

307
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,780
我以为他已经死了
It's in here. You see, I thought he was dead.

308
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:16,980
他在一次意外中失踪了
He disappeared when a storm...

309
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,580
他的船翻了
capsized his yacht during the Admiral's Cup.

310
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,710
人们也没有找到他的尸体
They never recovered his body...

311
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,250
所以当然的认为他已经死了
so, of course, declared him dead.

312
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:27,060
我是我的一个法国远房亲戚
He was a very distant French cousin of mine...

313
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,660
但我继承了他的遗产
but as the last living Malfete, I inherited his estate.

314
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,830
如果他是你的表哥
If he's your cousin...

315
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,390
你认为我应该怎么处置他？
what do you want me to do with him?

316
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,460
主人
Sire...

317
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,130
为什么罗莎琳德小姐 要称自己为朱丽娅
Why does Lady Rosalind call herself Julia...

318
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,200
并对我们受到这样的待遇 无动于衷？
and allow us to be beaten and chained?

319
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,140
乡巴佬
Peasant...

320
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,750
这不是在我们的年代
this is not our time.

321
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:56,380
巫师并没有把我们送回到过去
The wizard did not send us into the past.

322
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:00,380
他把我们送到了下一个一千年
He sent us into the next millennium.

323
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:05,660
现在已经是我之后的第十三代了
We are thirty generations removed from Malfete.

324
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,760
朱丽娅也不是我的爱人
Julia is not my beloved.

325
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,540
她是我的后代
She's my descendant.

326
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,570
后代？
Descendant?

327
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,170
我是朱丽娅
Amber, it's Julia.

328
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,870
能帮我接亨特吗？这件事很重要
Could you get me Hunter? It's important.

329
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,680
那个女人又来找你了
That rabbit of yours is on thephone again.

330
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,260
你好 宝贝 怎么了？
Hey, bunny. What's up?

331
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,450
瑟伯特 玛菲特 刚才就在博物馆
Thibault Malfete just showed up at the museum.

332
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,320
瑟伯特 玛菲特？
Thibault Malfete?

333
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,530
不可能 他应该已经
That's impossible. Isn't he supposed to be...

334
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,360
- 我知道  - 你能确定是他吗？
- I know.  - Are you sure it's him?

335
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,770
跟他的照片一模一样
He looks exactly like his photos.

336
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,770
他还知道家族格言
Hunter, he quoted the family motto.

337
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,070
他知道我们正在出售他的财产吗？
Does he know yet that we're selling his entire estate?

338
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,870
很难说清楚他到底知道什么
Well, it's hard to say what he knows.

339
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,400
他看上去很奇怪
He's a little strange.

340
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,410
亨特 这是不可思议的
Hunter, this is terrible.

341
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,070
庆幸的是他还活着
I mean, it's wonderful that he's alive...

342
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,450
但是可怕的是 我们已经开始出售他的财产
but it's terrible that we started to sell the estate.

343
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,450
哦 糟糕
Oh, God, I feel awful.

344
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,820
英国法庭已经宣布他死了
The English courts declared him dead.

345
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,480
我做这些都是合法的
We're well within our legal rights.

346
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,920
我们又不知道他还活着？
How were we supposed to know he was still alive?

347
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,890
他跟你提及钱的问题了吗？
Has he mentioned anything about money?

348
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,480
钱？
Money?

349
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,790
你在这个时候 怎么还想到钱？
How can you worry about money at a time like this?

350
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,300
我只是担心你
No, I'm just worrying about you.

351
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,770
你听起来很急躁 你的表哥现在在哪里？
You don't handle surprises well. Where is your cousin now?

352
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,900
他和他的朋友在楼下
He and this friend of his are downstairs with security.

353
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,770
今天晚上带他们回家 如何？
Why don'twe bring them home with us tonight?

354
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:21,610
毕竟还是他的家 我们是好客的
He's family after all. We want to be hospitable.

355
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,080
你真好
You're wonderful.

356
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,080
我在五分钟之后来接你
I'll pickyou all up in about five minutes.

357
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,310
我爱你 宝贝
Love ya. Bye, bunny.

358
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,820
再见
Bye, big bear.

359
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:33,340
哦 上帝 瑟伯特 玛菲特还活着
Oh, my God. Thibault Malfete's still alive.

360
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,860
这有点棘手
This is a disaster.

361
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,360
别生气
You're pouting.

362
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,090
不许你叫她宝贝
I hate it when you call her bunny.

363
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,860
哦 亲爱的 你比她强多了
You, my dear, are so much hotter than a bunny.

364
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,670
看看你自己 象一只母老虎
My God, look at yourself. You're a tigress.

365
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:59,340
朱丽娅 这是一件很恐怖的事情
Lady Julia, there has been a terrible mistake.

366
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,080
很抱歉 我们以为你已经死了
I'm so sorry. We thoughtyou were dead.

367
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,490
死？那个巫师只是一个笨蛋 但并不是杀手
Dead? No, the wizard was a fool, but not a killer.

368
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,490
他把我们送到了错误的地方
He only sent us the wrong way.

369
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,490
什么？
Excuse me?

370
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,790
我掉入了时间隧道
We fell into the Mountain of Time.

371
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,200
我必须回到我的时代
I must return to my time to prevent...

372
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,890
不然 我们的家族会有灭顶之灾的
a great tragedy to our family.

373
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,090
我希望你能帮助我
I ask for your assistance.

374
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,800
我会尽我所能
I'll do whatever I can.

375
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,010
太可怕了
Awful.

376
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:56,100
我们最好别出去！
We must not go out!

377
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,570
你在干什么？
What... what are you doing?

378
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,670
你们两个在干吗？我们必须在外边等
What are you doing? No, we have to wait outside.

379
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,510
亨特不能在这停车 我们得在外边等
Hunter can't park here. We have to wait for him.

380
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,180
哦 上帝
Oh, my God.

381
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,680
你这个胆小鬼
Bloody coward.

382
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,350
我们必须…
We have to...

383
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,390
他们消失了
Those boys are lost.

384
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,270
我必须去找回他们
I must go and retrieve them.

385
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,050
这是英国吗？
This is England?

386
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,560
- 不  - 肉！
- No...  - Meat!

387
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,110
这是在芝加哥
This is Chicago.

388
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,390
肉 肉 肉！
Meat, meat, meat!

389
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,790
这是在美国
This is the United States.

390
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,130
肉！
Meat!

391
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,720
我记得我应该在英国
The last I remember was in Sussex, England...

392
00:25:58,770 --> 00:25:59,960
在我的城堡里
in my castle chambers.

393
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,660
你什么都记不起来了 从那以后？
You don't remember anything since then?

394
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,800
是的
No.

395
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,740
我想你可能
Do you think maybe you've suffered...

396
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,800
在意外中丧失了一部分记忆？
some sort of memory loss from the accident?

397
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,330
没错！自从我喝掉那鬼药水 我就什么都记不起来了
Yes! After I drankthe potion, I remember nothing.

398
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,540
- 药水？ - 一整瓶！
- Onions?  - All of them!

399
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,570
太好了 你喜欢吃热狗？
All right. You like to eat hot dogs, huh?

400
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,950
无论哪种狗我都不介意
I like to eat every kind of dog.

401
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,180
你疯了吗？
Now, what are you doing?

402
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,810
- 宝贝！ - 滚开！
- Aargh!  - Leave the dogs!

403
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,480
哦 不！
No, no, no. Stop it!

404
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,490
停手
Please, stop.

405
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,080
实在是对不起
I'm sorry, I'm so very sorry.

406
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,820
他是法国人
He's French.

407
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,730
看的出来
Yeah. Very.

408
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,290
亲爱的
Hi, honey.

409
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,600
情况比我想象的要糟
The situation's much worse than I thought.

410
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,110
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

411
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:46,540
哦 见鬼
Holy shit.

412
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:51,380
亨特 这就是瑟伯特 玛菲特
Hunter, this is Thibault Malfete.

413
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,050
瑟伯特 这是我的未婚夫
Thibault, this is my fiance, Hunter.

414
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,180
很高兴见到你
Pleased to meet you.

415
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,660
- 你是贵族吗？ - 不是
- Are you noble?  - No. Sorry.

416
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,460
但我能确定 你肯定是
But I can certainly tell that you are.

417
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:02,930
这是安德鲁 瑟伯特的仆人
And this is Andre, Thibault's assistant.

418
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,230
大鼻子你好
Hello, big nose.

419
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,860
跟在战车后边 乡巴佬
Run behind the chariot, peasant.

420
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,870
遵命 主人！
Yes, master!

421
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,870
不能让他跟着车跑
He can't run behind the car.

422
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:12,170
因为他不是贵族 所以他不能骑
He cannot ride. He's not noble.

423
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,670
我知道 但他必须上车
Yes, but he has to ride in the car.

424
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:16,300

- He's very fast.  - We're taking the freeway.

425
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,750

- You can run 70 miles an hour?  - I have good boots.

426
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,580
不 你必须上车
No. You must sit in the car, please.

427
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,140
- 我能跑  - 我知道你能
- I am fast.  - I'm sure you are.

428
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,680
换个时候再跑给我看吧
I'd love to see you run sometime.

429
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,050
- 听她的吧  - 是的 主人
- Obey.  - Yes, my lord.

430
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,490
你要一些狗吗？
Do you want some dog?

431
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,030
太快了
Too fast.

432
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,770
你们还行吧？
Are you OK, Mr. Pate?

433
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:53,110
还是太快了！
Ohh. Too fast!

434
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,640
亲爱的 你能再慢一点吗？
Honey, could you slow down just a little bit?

435
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,450
现在时速只有二十二英里
I'm going 22 miles an hour.

436
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,720
我知道 你能放慢到二十一吗？
Yes, I know. Could you try going 21?

437
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,060
你的车怎么了？
Hey, what's the matter with you?

438
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,290
你知道怎么开车吗？
You don't know how to drive?

439
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,350
别管我
Go.

440
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,260
靠！
What?

441
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,300
马上就要到了
It's gonna be fine.

442
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,480
哦 上帝
Oh, dear.

443
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,250
别从窗户出来
Get in and open the door.

444
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,820
进屋吧
Let's go inside.

445
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,990
哦 宝贝
Hi, sweetie. Hello, Churchill.

446
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,900
宝贝 来这 拍一下手掌
Hello. Come here. Give Mom a high-five.

447
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,460
这是我的宝贝
All right. That's my boy.

448
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,470
走吧
Let's go.

449
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,170
我喜欢你的帽子
Like the hat.

450
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:00,670
安杰列！过来一下！
Angelique! I need you now!

451
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,840
进屋 乡巴佬
Come here, peasant.

452
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,610
- 马上过来！ - 我这就来
- Come now!  - OK, I'm coming.

453
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,780
快点
Hurry up.

454
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,620
你怎么办到的？
How did you do that?

455
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,830
黑夜
Night.

456
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,770
白天
Day.

457
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:26,540
黑夜 白天！
Night. Day!

458
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,130
在我的城堡里 没有这个发明
I do not have this invention in my castle.

459
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,340
你们有电吗？
You don't have power?

460
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,010
我有权利去判处别人死刑
I have the power to judge and condemn to death...

461
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,410
惩治在我领土里的坏人
any villain on my land.

462
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:36,820
哦 是吗？
Oh. Really?

463
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,180
亨特看来要小心了
Hunter will be so jealous.

464
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:43,050
我去给你们拿点喝的
I'm gonna get you two something to drink.

465
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,290
亨特从来不干这些
Make Hunter one of his power-dude smoothie things.

466
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,490
这个挺不错
I'd offer you one...

467
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,290
但除了他之外没人喜欢这个
but nobody seems to like them but him.

468
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,660
安德鲁 你能停一下吗？
Andre, could you please stop that?

469
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:03,080
我感觉自己在迪厅
I'm just starting to feel like I'm in a disco.

470
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,410
亲爱的小姐
My dear lady...

471
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:10,920
你说你会帮助我的
you said you would offer me your assistance.

472
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:14,220
是的 你需要什么？
Oh, yes. Anything. What do you need?

473
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,880
我要找一个巫师
I need to find a wizard.

474
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,220
哦！对不起 主人！对不起！
Aah! Sorry, master. Sorry!

475
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,350
- 对不起！ - 笨蛋
- Sorry!  - Idiot!

476
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,590
马上对这位小姐道歉！
Apologize to the lady!

477
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,260
对不起 主人 饶恕我吧
Sorry,master. I ask for mercy.

478
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,060
请见谅
Forgive him, milady.

479
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,590
没关系 反正地板也要清洗
It's OK. The floor needed to be cleaned anyway.

480
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,100
对了 你刚才说
So, you were saying something about what...

481
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,400
一个巫师？
should we say a wizard?

482
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,140
我要回到我的年代
I need to go back into the tunnels of Time.

483
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,170
当然
Of course.

484
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,280
我想知道在你身上 到底发生了什么
I need to just understand what has happened to you.

485
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,120
你的船在一次意外中沉了？
Now, your yacht went down in a storm?

486
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,750
不是 你听我说
No. You must listen.

487
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,390
我来自于过去
I am from the time of Thibault VI...

488
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:57,890
现在我来到了未来
and I have come to the future.

489
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:03,230
时间隧道 巫师
OK. Tunnels of Time. Wizards. Thibault VI.

490
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,880
你没事吧？
Are you OK?

491
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,770
没事
Yes, lady.

492
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,880
我看你还不相信我
Lovely flower, I see you do not believe me.

493
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:20,550
但你必须试着去接受
It is a pity, but please...try.

494
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,950
当然我会
Yes. Of course I'll try.

495
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,160
她是绿色的
She's green.

496
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,390
我从来没有想尝尝这个
I never really did like the taste of this.

497
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,930
哦 上帝 怎么了？
Oh, my God. What happened?

498
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,970
没什么
Nothing.

499
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,740
这个肉我很喜欢
I'm eating this very good meat...

500
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,840
还有加了沙司的蔬菜
with vegetables in a fine sauce.

501
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,980
明天拉屎的时候会很通畅
I will shit easy tomorrow.

502
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,420
这是晕车的表现
It's jet lag.

503
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,580
去洗手吧
All right, I'm sure you would like to wash your hands...

504
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,530
或者别的什么都行
and whatever else.

505
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,620
你跟我来？
Why don't you come with me?

506
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:04,920
就是这儿
All right. Here you go.

507
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,840
自己解决吧
Just gonna take this.

508
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:13,270
朱丽娅 我能跟你谈谈吗？
Julia! Can I talk to you for a moment, please?

509
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,270
好好使用肥皂
Don't be bashful with the soap.

510
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,510
那是什么 主人？一个宝座？
What is it, master? A throne?

511
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,950
可能是
It could be.

512
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,480
他们是疯子！
They're crazy!

513
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,610
他们的经历很复杂
They have been through a terrible ordeal.

514
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,780
他们有健忘症
They have amnesia.

515
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,850
健忘症？他们是疯子！
Amnesia? They're wacked!

516
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,720
他们的确很笨
They're completely retarded.

517
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,190
他们脑子有问题！
They're...Woo! You know?

518
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,300
- 清水  - 哈 哈！
- Clean water.  - Ha ha!

519
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,710
这个长毛巾有香味
The long towel has a good fragrance.

520
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,810
瑟伯特是我的表哥 他是我的家人
Thibault is my cousin, Hunter. He's my family.

521
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,650
是吗？我不敢肯定
Yeah? I'm not so sure.

522
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:06,350
他以为自己是贵族
He doesn't strike me as being particularly noble.

523
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,570
朱丽娅 下来！这有点问题
Julia, come down here! It's an emergency.

524
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,770
- 很好的一个泉水  - 没错
- Very good fountain.  - Yes.

525
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:25,540
你的法国亲戚在厕所里洗澡
Your French relatives are bathing in the toilet.

526
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,270
天啊
Oh, my God.

527
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,550
牙刷
Toothbrushes.

528
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:42,360
我把他们放在这
I'll just leave them right here.

529
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,920
我马上回来
I'll be rightback.

530
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,640
我要去洗个澡
I'm going to take a shower...

531
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,470
然后去收拾厨房
then go tackle that kitchen.

532
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,370
抓紧 我们的晚餐定在八点
Hurry. Our dinner reservation's at 8:00.

533
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,110
哦！我们去哪吃？
Oh! Where are we going?

534
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,110
拉图尔
Latour.

535
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:03,520
你不觉得那里有点太正式吗？
Isn't that just a little formal for our guests?

536
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,140
你跟我说的你表哥很高贵
First you tell me your cousin's nobility...

537
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,280
然后你又不满意
then you get mad at me when I suggest...

538
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,290
也许他并不是
that just maybe, he's not.

539
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,160
我选了镇上最好的餐厅 你却不高兴
Now you're upset because I pick the best restaurant in town.

540
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:15,490
我不知道怎么做 才能让你满意
You make it impossible for me to do the right thing.

541
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,900
没错 你是对的 拉图尔挺好
No. You're right. Latour's gonna be great.

542
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:21,130
谢谢 亲爱的
Thankyou, big bear.

543
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:23,160
- 我去洗澡了  - 好的
- I'll be in the shower.  - All right.

544
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,680
味道很不错
Ah. Verygood flavor.

545
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:42,120
这不是酒 乡巴佬
This is not wine, ignorant peasant.

546
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,680
这是洗澡用的油
It is oil for the bath.

547
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,730
味道很不错
Mmm. Very good perfume.

548
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,210
很不错
Very creamy.

549
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,310
轮到你了
Bathe, servant.

550
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:11,810
不 我在圣诞节时已经洗过了
No, my sire. I have taken a bath at Christmas.

551
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,480
- 洗！ - 不！
- Bathe!  - No, no!

552
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,960
我不想因为感冒而死去！
I'm afraid! I don't want to catch cold and die!

553
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:21,130
安静！
Be silent, peasant!

554
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,460
你还有这个洗澡用的油吗？
Do you have another bottle of this bathing oil for Andre?

555
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,730
你知道你刚才用的
Do you realize the bath you just took...

556
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,500
超过两千美元？
costover $2,000?

557
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,370
那是美元
That's American dollars.

558
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,630
很贵吗？
Is that a lot?

559
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,300
没错
Yes, it is.

560
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,970
我会还给你的
Then I will repay you with one of my swans.

561
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,540
哦 听起来很公平
Oh, well. That sounds fair.

562
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:52,220
我的族谱 这么多的后代
My family tree. So many descendants.

563
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,970
- 哪位？ - 请找卡瑟笛先生
- Hello?  - Mr. Cassidy, please.

564
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:16,040
等一会儿
Yeah. Hold on one second. Hunter?

565
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,550
怎么？
Yeah, bunny?

566
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,920
你办公室的电话 要接么？
Honey, it's your office. Do you want to take it?

567
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:21,620
- 我在楼上接吧  - 好的
- I'll take it upstairs.  - Oh, OK.

568
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:25,220
哪位？
Hello? Hello?

569
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,230
你好
Hello.

570
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,280
喂？
Hello?

571
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,390
你好
Hello.

572
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,420
你是谁？
Who is this?

573
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:33,370
我是安德鲁
I'm Andre le Pate. I have big balls...

574
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,130
我的屁股在冒火
and my ass breathes fire.

575
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,100
肯定很疼
Wow. That must hurt.

576
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,110
- 喂  - 喂？
- Hello.  - Hello?

577
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,130
我叫你别往我家打电话
I told you never to call me here.

578
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,370
哦 我忘了
Well, I forgot.

579
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:45,070
- 喂！ - 你跟谁在一起？
- Hello! Enter!  - Somebody there with you?

580
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,780
- 哦！ - 天啊！
- Aah!  - Jesus!

581
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:53,150
马上挂掉电话！否则我给警察打电话
Hangup the damn phone, or I'll call the police!

582
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,880
我想他挂上电话了
I think he hung up the phone.

583
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,980
是瑟伯特的私人助理
It was Thibault's little retarded homuncular assistant.

584
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,460
看 多危险
Look, this is dangerous.

585
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,660
我等朱丽娅睡了再给你电话？
I'll call you back after Julia goes to bed, OK?

586
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,800
朱丽娅小姐
Lady Julia.

587
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,630
你好漂亮
You are more than a rose.

588
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:18,010
你真的很漂亮
You are love's own flower.

589
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:22,520
你真好笑
Come on. That's ridiculous.

590
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:26,180
这是件旧衣服 很早以前穿过
No, I just... This old thing, I threw it on.

591
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,810
好几年没穿了
I haven'tworn it in a couple of years...

592
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:32,320
我应该想出一个姿势来答谢你
but I guess I should learn how to take a compliment.

593
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,350
多谢
Thank you.

594
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,290
还不够
Almost.

595
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,120
谢谢
Thank you.

596
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,500
好多了
Much better.

597
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:47,030
亲表妹的手
Kissing cousins.

598
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,920
我从来没有见过
I don't think that I've ever seen anyone...

599
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,620
一个人能吃这么多的
eat a steak in two bites before.

600
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,530
谢谢 主人！
Thank you, master!

601
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,500
祝福你！
Be blessed!

602
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,140
我敢保证
I can assure you...

603
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,850
谢谢！
Thank you!

604
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:39,490
还要松露沙司吗？
Like some more truffle sauce with that?

605
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,160
对不起 但是这位先生
Excuse me, butthe gentleman...

606
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,400
不能离开桌子进餐
can't eat off the floor.

607
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,270
他不是先生 他是我的仆人
He's not a gentleman. He's my servant...

608
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,610
他不能和我坐一起
and he's not worthy of our company.

609
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,940
谢谢
Thank you.

610
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,450
实在抱歉 安德鲁 你能
I'm truly sorry, sir. Andre, would you please...

611
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,450
不 夫人 这是不可能的
No, no, milady. It is not possible.

612
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,510
求你了
Please.

613
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:09,020
瑟伯特 能让他坐到桌子前么？
Thibault, please, will you let him sit at the table?

614
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,110
算我求你了？
For me?

615
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,460
好 我答应你
I will please you, lovely one.

616
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,390
来吧 你这个笨蛋
Obey,foolish wart.

617
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,480
谢谢
Thank you.

618
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,210
可他们不会感觉舒服的
And you were worried they wouldn't be comfortable.

619
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:44,610
实际上 地板更适合他
Actually, the floor wasn't such a bad place for him.

620
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,020
便于清洗
Easier to hose down.

621
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,000
奶酪！奶酪太好吃了！
Cheese! Very good cheese!

622
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,830
安德鲁 你在干吗？
Andre, what are you doing?

623
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:55,430
你在干吗？安德鲁？不！
What are you doing? Andre? No, no!

624
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:58,770
- 安德鲁 别这样  - 这样不好！
- Andre, no.  - No. Bad!

625
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,930
坐下 好好吃你的
Hey. Sit down. Eat this.

626
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,940
亨特 你能…
Hunter, could you...

627
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,110
这是点心？
No. This is for dessert. All right?

628
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,350
别这样
Please, sir, please.

629
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,980
对不起
I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.

630
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:18,010
都记在帐上 好吧 谢谢
Just add it to the check. All right? Thank you.

631
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,860
吃完正餐后再吃这个 好吗？
You eat this after dinner. All right?

632
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,860
没关系 真对不起
No, it's all right. I'm terribly sorry.

633
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,590
你只管记在帐上就行了
Just add it to the bill. Thank you.

634
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,000
好的
All right.

635
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,440
我脸上有什么东西吗？
Do I have something on my face?

636
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:36,270
你让我想起了国王的女儿
You remind me of the daughter of a king.

637
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,800
谢谢
Thank you.

638
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:42,610
由于血统关系
On the subject of Julia's noble ancestry...

639
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,550
你应该知道朱丽娅 为什么继承了你的遗产？
you do understand why she was granted control of the estate?

640
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:49,050
朱丽娅是玛菲特家族的 我的就是她的
Julia is a Malfete. Everything I have is hers.

641
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:51,960
那你没有异议 如果她继续拥有你的财产？
So you have no objection if she retains control?

642
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:54,120
- 没有  - 好的
- No.  - Wonderful.

643
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,030
我想你对我们的计划 会感到很满意的
I'm sure you'll be very pleased with our plans.

644
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,720
你将使我们…
They're going to make us...

645
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:00,630
我的意思是 你和朱丽娅都很有钱
I mean you and Julia-very wealthy.

646
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,370
我本来就很有钱 有成百上千的马
I am already wealthy. I own hundreds of horses...

647
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,400
十大箱胡椒 四百多袋羊毛
ten chests of pepper, four hundred bags of wool...

648
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,770
还有五十桶西班牙橄榄汁
and fifty barrels of Spanish olives.

649
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,180
你还有我 主人
And you own me, sire.

650
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,700
是的 但是你不值钱
Yes, but you have no value.

651
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:16,310
没错
That is true.

652
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:22,480
你该道歉
Excuse you.

653
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,090
别给恶魔留下任何东西！
Leave nothing for the devil!

654
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:30,720
- 你听到了吗？ - 是的
- Did you hear that?  - Yes, I did, sweetheart.

655
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:33,060
他们身体不大舒服
They're not in very good health, all right?

656
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,190
不理会就是了
So,just try to ignore it, if you can.

657
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,360
- 主人  - 干吗？
- Sire.  - What?

658
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:39,900
我要拉屎
I want to make pee-pee.

659
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,000
- 啊！你要拉屎？ - 是的
- Ah! You wantto pee?  - Yes.

660
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,100
去外边！
Outside!

661
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,010
外边？但是 主人
Outside? But, sire...

662
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,570
但我会被狼吃掉的
I could be eaten by the wolves.

663
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:49,450
那就找个火把
Find a torch! ldiot.

664
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,880
找个火把
Find a torch.

665
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:57,590
安德鲁有如此的要求 呵呵
Andre has such simple needs. I think that's great.

666
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,830
要帮忙吗？
Need some help, sir?

667
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:28,490
好美丽
Oh, it is beautiful.

668
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,120
水竟然会自己流出来！
The water comes out by itself. Ha!

669
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,600
这是一个有魔力的泉水
It is a magic fountain.

670
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,530
看这个！
Look at this! Mmm.

671
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:47,470
它的味道跟森林一样
It smells just like the forest.

672
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:50,670
这么小小的一块 就包容了整个森林的味道
All the forest is in the small wheel.

673
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:51,740
闻它！
Mmm. Smell it!

674
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,300
不用了 谢谢
No. No, thankyou.

675
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:54,750
你不想试一试？
You don't want to smell it?

676
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,180
自己慢慢享受吧
Enjoy your self.

677
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,420
城堡被拆了
The castle's a wreck.

678
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,080
所以我要帮助她分配财产
So I'm helping her divide the estate up...

679
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,250
使它更利于管理
into more manageable, profitable chunks.

680
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:08,020
我们要卖掉那些艺术品和高档物品
We're selling the art and various high-end pieces...

681
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,530
这是唯一的出路
through an outlet here.

682
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,030
事实上我是在帮助她 我把这视作我的责任
Essentially, I'm protecting her. I see that as my role.

683
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:13,660
土地呢？
And the land?

684
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,790
我也打算卖了
I decided we should sell that, too.

685
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,360
这由不得你决定
It is not for you to decide.

686
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,600
只有朱丽娅有权做出决定
Only Lady Julia can say what will be done.

687
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,410
我就是替朱丽娅说的
I speak for both Julia and myself.

688
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,000
你不能代替一个亚玛特家族的人说话
You cannot possibly speak for a Malfete.

689
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:28,010
你怎么想的 小姐？
What are your wishes, milady?

690
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:34,810
我想我还应该考虑考虑
I guess I'd like to think about it...

691
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,290
再考虑成熟一点
a little bit more, actually.

692
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,790
朱丽娅？
Julia?

693
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:39,490
你不应该打断这位小姐的话！
The lady has spoken!

694
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,520
鸡丁沙拉！
Chicken salad,now!

695
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:48,800
我要那个蛋糕
I want that cake. Come on now.

696
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,330
别全部拿走
Don't take all night.

697
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:03,470
油鸡
Greasy chicken.

698
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,920
你在干什么？
What on earth do you think you're doing?

699
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:13,220
你好 安德鲁
Hi, Andre.

700
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,060
我想我还应该在你们的帐单上
I'm afraid I'm going to have to add an order...

701
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:28,560
加上烧鸡的钱
of chicken a la umbrella to your bill.

702
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,080
闻闻森林的味道
Smell the forest.

703
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,250
很香
Yes, it's minty.

704
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:46,730
从兰色的喷泉拿的
It's from the blue fountain.

705
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,790
不错
Nice. Yeah. Oh, all right.

706
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,790
你要薄荷糖吗？
Honey, would you like a mint?

707
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:54,820
- 是  - 好的
- Yeah.  - All right. Good.

708
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:56,960
- 你呢？ - 主人

709
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,750
这个很不错 再给我几片
Those are good. Give me another one.

710
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:16,950
是的 很好吃
Yes. Very minty.

711
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:43,580
晚上好
Good evening, fine sir.

712
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,640
我在找 瑟伯特 玛菲特
I'm seeking Thibault of Malfete...

713
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:49,650
阿德拉伯爵 尊敬的骑士？
the Duke of Anjou. The great chevalier?

714
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:00,090
安德鲁不需要床
Andre does not need a bed.

715
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:02,360
只要给他一些稻草就可以了
He will be happy with some straw.

716
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:06,340
- 是的  - 我们没有稻草
- Yes.  - We're out of straw.

717
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:15,180
我的床好舒服
My bed is soft.

718
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,820
现在是家庭问答时间
It's time for the "Family Feud."

719
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:26,560
这些可怜的人被困在里头了！
Oh! Poor little people. They're trapped inside!

720
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:31,620
上帝 饶恕我吧 我应该怎么帮他们？
God have mercy. What are we going to do, my sire?

721
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:33,460
解救他们
Free them.

722
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:45,430
亲爱的 你真的认为他们有健忘症吗？
Bunny? You really think these guys have amnesia?

723
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,470
我不知道
I don't know.

724
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:48,710
我们来了！
We are coming!

725
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:54,080
你认为他们有神经病？
So you admit they're clinically insane?

726
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,110
我并没有那么说
I didn't say that.

727
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,850
哦 别这样！
Oh, come on!

728
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:03,150
他们上哪了？
Where did they go, my lord?

729
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,270
他们在里边 我们救不了他们
They were inside. We could not save them.

730
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:16,570
好悲哀啊
It is tragic.

731
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:19,740
反正我们也用不着这间屋子了
Well, we never really used this room anyway.

732
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,180
可惜
It's a pity.

733
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:31,520
我要找到巫师
I need to find a wizard now.

734
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,520
不介意我先喝杯咖啡吧
Do you mind if I get some coffee first?

735
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:45,430
见鬼！
Jesus Christ!

736
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:47,270
我让你别把这些东西留在那
I've told you notto leave this stuff...

737
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,030
居然放在路当中 你到底要干什么？
in the middle of the driveway! What are you trying to do?

738
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:51,010
你想要我的命吗！
You just about broke my god damn neck!

739
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,840
对不起
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

740
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,270
你到底有没有干活
Do you actually do any gardening around here...

741
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:56,240
或者你给我走人？
or do you just sing out of tune?

742
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,800
去弄干净
Just cleanit up!

743
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:02,110
哦！混蛋！
Oh! Hey, big belly!

744
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:04,620
你竟敢冒犯这位姑娘？
You dare to touch a lady?

745
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:05,810
你到底是谁？
Who the hell are you?

746
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:07,550
我是安德鲁 我鄙视你
I'm Andre, and I piss on you.

747
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:08,990
你最好给我滚出去
Yeah, well, you get the hell out of here...

748
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:09,990
或者我去叫警察
or I'm gonna call the cops.

749
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:11,290
对这位小姐道歉
Apologize to the lady.

750
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:14,660
小姐？你叫她小姐
Lady? You're calling her a...

751
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,460
好
Lady. Right.

752
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,530
对不起
I'm sorry.

753
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:21,160
亲她的脚
Kiss her feet.

754
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,400
- 什么？ - 亲她的脚！
- Do what?  - Kiss her feet!

755
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,030
疯了！
Oh, Jesus!

756
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:26,340
别去找巫师
Instead of a wizard...

757
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:29,070
我想我们要去看医生
I think what we really need to find you is a good doctor.

758
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:31,480
巫师是最好的医生
Wizards are the best doctors.

759
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,640
那在干吗？
What in the world is that?

760
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,020
你在干吗？
What are you doing?

761
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:38,320
快打九一一！
Call 911!

762
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:39,820
怎么了？
What is going on here?

763
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,920
她对这位小姐动粗
He was very rude to the lady.

764
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,360
看着 笨蛋 这是族徽
Look, fool. A coat of arms.

765
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:46,760
他是一个贵族
He is a nobleman.

766
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,360
我不知道
I did not know.

767
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,370
笨蛋
Stupid peasant.

768
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,100
- 他们是谁？ - 游客
- Who are these guys?  - Visitors.

769
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:54,100
你拥有这个女人？
Do you own this woman?

770
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,570
她为我工作
She works for me.

771
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:58,200
我会把他倒着吊起来的
Then I will hang my valet by his feet on your behalf.

772
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,370
不 主人
No, please, my lord.

773
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:01,880
吊手吧 别吊脚啊
Not by the feet! I prefer the thumbs.

774
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:03,850
我有个会要开
I got a meeting to catch.

775
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,180
起来 傻瓜
Rise,idiot.

776
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,610
我把他送给你
I give him to you for the day.

777
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:09,620
你想干吗都行
You may beat him if you like.

778
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:11,620
谢谢 但我们刚刚认识
Thanks, but we just met.

779
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:14,950
谢谢 我伟大 仁慈的主人
Thankyou, my great and merciful master.

780
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:18,050
谢谢主人！谢谢！
Thank you, milord! Thank you!

781
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:21,590
走吧 我要马上找个巫师
Letus go. We have a wizard to find.

782
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:23,430
巫师？
A wizard?

783
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:26,530
- 你是法国人吗？ - 是
- Are you French?  - Yes.

784
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:29,200
- 你喜欢这吗？ - 这很奇怪
- Do you like it here?  - It is very strange.

785
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,540
这味道很难闻 而且吃的东西很少
It smells bad, and the food is too little...

786
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:33,910
但有漂亮的小姐
but the ladies are wonderful.

787
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,710
我想我的老板也是这么想的
I wish my boss thought like that.

788
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:39,080
老板 哈哈 老板 老板是什么？
Boss. Ha ha. Boss. What is boss?

789
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,880
你为老板而工作 就跟你的主人一样
The guy you work for. The big guy.

790
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,940
我能吃他吃剩的骨头
I can have his bones when he's eating.

791
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:47,750
好恶心
That is so disgusting.

792
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:49,880
好恶心
That's so gross.

793
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:52,950
你要想个办法离开他
You have to figure out a way to get away from him.

794
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,930
他是我的主人 我不想被吊死
He's my master. I don't want to be hung.

795
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:56,990
上吊！
Hung!

796
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:58,190
你没有必要上吊！
You're not gonna be hung!

797
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:01,140
那是违背法律的？
That's completely against the law, OK?

798
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:03,400
好
OK. OK!

799
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:06,970
他付给你很多钱吗？
Does he pay a lot of money?

800
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:08,340
每个月一次
Once every month he permits me...

801
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,970
允许我在他的土地上打猎
to hunt pheasants on his lands.

802
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:12,840
那就是没有钱？
So you make no money?

803
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,280
我有一件珠宝
I have a treasure.

804
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:22,660
你把那个叫什么？
What do you call that again?

805
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:24,960
叫“L”
The "L".

806
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:25,960
哦 等等
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

807
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,720
在我们下去之前
Before we get downstairs to the crowd...

808
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,260
我要给你这个 我家的电话号码
I've got this for you. Here's my phone number.

809
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:34,100
如果你走丢了就用这个
I want you to wear this just in case you get lost.

810
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,370
我不会走丢的
I will not get lost.

811
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:41,400
没有目标的人才会走丢
You can only be lost if you have no purpose...

812
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,140
而我有目标 我要…
and I have purpose, which is to find a...

813
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:46,170
找到一个巫师
A wizard. Right.

814
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:49,080
我都不知道应该去哪儿找
I don't even know where to start with that one.

815
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,050
我从来没有见过巫师
I mean, I have never met a wizard.

816
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,450
我不相信他们有魔力
I don't even think they make wizards anymore.

817
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:57,550
哦！我的钱包！等等 瑟伯特！
Oh! My purse! Wait, Thibault! Wait!

818
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,220
在这儿别动！
Wait!No!

819
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:01,630
- 把钱包那走！ - 不！不！
- Take the purse!  - No! No!

820
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:04,160
他是小偷 我要砍掉他的手
He's a thief. I have to cut his hand.

821
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,530
不！
No, no, no!

822
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:07,000
钱包你拿走好了
Please, just take it.

823
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,370
没事了
OK. Everything's fine now.

824
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:13,400
在广场把他给吊死
Hang him in the public square.

825
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,880
- 啊！ - 安静 老女人！
- Aah!  - Silence, old woman!

826
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:17,140
你这并不是在帮我
You're not helping.

827
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,690
巫师！老巫师！等等！
Witch! Old witch! Wait!

828
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,190
对不起 我以为你是个老女巫
I am sorry. I thought you were an old hag.

829
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:33,020
我比巫师更厉害
I've been called worse.

830
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,000
瑟伯特 你为什么不来告诉她
Thibault, why don't you come and tell her...

831
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:37,690
哦 不 不 不
Oh, no. Oh, no.

832
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,560
你见到过一个巫师吗？
Ah, would you happen to know a wizard?

833
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:47,500
能告诉我怎么找到一个巫师 啊？
Can you tell me where to find a wizard?

834
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:48,530
一个巫师
A wizard.

835
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,070
好的
Well.

836
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:22,940
乡巴佬 你们谁能告诉我怎么找到一个巫师？
Peasants, which one of you can show me to a wizard?

837
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,710
我会付报酬的
There will be a reward.

838
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:27,310
我们的兰开斯特勇士 在这找巫师
Sir Lancelot here's looking for a wizard.

839
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:29,510
我们都是？哈 哈 哈！
Aren't we all? Ha ha ha!

840
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:31,180
我不是兰开斯特
I am not Lancelot.

841
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:33,650
我是 瑟伯特 玛菲特

拉波拉的统治者
Lord of Libourne.

844
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,990
是吗？那我还是国王
Yeah? Well, I'm Sid from Cicero...

845
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:43,760
哈撒得的公爵 台球王子
Duke of Hazzard, Baron of Billiards...

846
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,060
还是
and Lord of Lord-knows-what...

847
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:50,770
现在我要和你决斗
and I challenge you to a duel.

848
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:52,070
来吧！
En garde!

849
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:55,940
别让我杀了你
Do not make me kill you.

850
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:58,850
来啊 你看见这个了吗？
En garde, I say. You watching this, honey?

851
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,750
因为你的傲慢 我要杀了你
I should kill you for your insolence...

852
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:05,380
但我现在太渴了
but I am too thirsty...

853
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:08,690
所以我先要喝东西
so instead, I will quench my thirst...

854
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,820
今天我请客
and yours and yours.

855
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:18,330
全喝光！
Drink up!

856
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,840
你不会相信这个的
You're not gonna believe a word of this.

857
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,940
猜是谁的展品
Not a word of it. Guess whose exhibit...

858
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,110
昨天晚上又一个访客
had another visitor last night?

859
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:36,710
东西到处在飞
There was sparks flying...

860
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,480
各种奇怪的声音
and all sorts of weird noises.

861
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,780
然后就发生怪事
Then there was this poof.

862
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:41,150
怪事
Poof.

863
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:42,490
绿色闪光 一声巨响 他就出现了
And a green flash, and then bang, he was there.

864
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:43,690
谁？
Who was there?

865
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:46,790
- 看起来象巫师  - 巫师
- The wizard- looking dude.  - Wizard.

866
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:47,990
看
Look.

867
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:50,120
他把这个床给烧了
He burnt the bed spread where he came in.

868
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:52,130
不可思议
Absolutely shocking.

869
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:54,970
等等
Wait a minute.

870
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,840
这个以前不在这
This wasn't here before.

871
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:16,390
他说他是朱丽娅的表哥
He says he's Julia's cousin.

872
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:18,690
我看他是假冒的
I say he's a fake.

873
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:23,530
我要在二十四小时之内得到答案
I want an answer in 24 hours.

874
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:29,960
怎么样？
See, tiger?

875
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:32,370
我将要得到这些遗产了
Daddy's gonna take care of this business.

876
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:34,710
你又会和我和好了？
You gonna be nice to me again?

877
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:36,210
喂？
Hello?

878
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,610
亨特 又有不可思议的事情发生
Hunter,you're not gonna believe this.

879
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:39,380
我就在这
Bunny, I'm right here.

880
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,540
我把瑟伯特弄丢了 因为他要找一个巫师
I lost Thibault because he was looking for a wizard.

881
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,680
他走丢了…
And then he just freaked out...

882
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,310
他丢不了的
Nobody just loses a guy...

883
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:46,950
他穿得象中世纪的骑士
dressed like a medieval knight in Chicago.

884
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:49,050
但我就是丢了
Well, I did.

885
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:50,060
等等
Wait. Hold on a second.

886
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,180
喂？
Hello?

887
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:52,320
有人知道
Yeah, does anybody there know...

888
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,890
公爵
the Count of whoop-de-do, the Baron of blah...

889
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:56,590
是的
Yes, I do.

890
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:59,100
好的 谢谢
Wonderful. Thankyou.

891
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,530
我找到他了 谢谢
All right, I found him. I gotta go.

892
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:02,870
- 那我就放心了  - 我爱你 再见
- I'm so relieved.  - Love you. Bye.

893
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:04,770
他又回来了 哼？
So he's back, huh?

894
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:08,370
我真希望
Yeah. I was hoping he'd tripped on his cape...

895
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:11,470
他一头掉进芝加哥河
and swan-dived into the Chicago River.

896
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:20,750
瑟伯特！
Thibault!

897
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:22,150
瑟伯特！
Thibault!

898
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,160
各位 各位！
Everybody, everybody!

899
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,560
这是我曾曾曾曾
This is my great, great, great, great...

900
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,760
曾孙女
great-granddaughter.

901
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:38,430
说真的 我的曾曾曾曾祖父和我 必须马上走
Actually, grand, grand, grand, grand, grandpa and I must go.

902
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:39,840
不行！
No!

903
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,310
你必须先唱一首歌！
You have to sing first!

904
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,280
不 我不会
No, I don't...

905
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:45,280
是的 你必须唱
Yes. You must sing first.

906
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:59,090
马上走 就现在
Have to go, now, now, now

907
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:00,600
为什么？
Why?

908
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:03,530
是啊 你应该给我们一个好的理由
Yeah. You have to give us a good reason.

909
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:04,790
我找到一个巫师
I found a wizard.

910
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:06,460
那就把他带来！
Well, bring him along!

911
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,970
不 我们必须走
No, we have to go.

912
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,490
我知道！
I knew it!

913
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,670
我必须走
I must leave you now.

914
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:15,010
不
Oh, no, no, no.

915
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,010
再见 兰开斯特勇士
So long, Lancelot.

916
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:18,340
我不是兰开斯特
I am not Lancelot.

917
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:20,610
我是瑟伯特 玛菲特公爵
I am Thibault, Count of Malfete.

918
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:27,720
我知道是那个英国巫师
Of course it is that bloody English wizard.

919
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,720
他也跟真我来了
He has followed me through time.

920
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,590
这很好 我的意思是
Great. Great. I mean, he probably...

921
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:34,260
他也刚刚喝了那东西
just whipped up some eye of new potion thingie...

922
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,290
并且象巫师那样
and he waved his hands over it a few times...

923
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:39,430
在嘴里说一些拉丁语！
and said some words in Latin, and voila!

924
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:41,160
瑟伯特？
Thibault?

925
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,100
我开始相信你了
I'm starting to believe you.

926
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,570
我开始相信你所说的一切
I'm starting to believe everything...

927
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:47,580
这对于一个二十一世纪的女孩来说 的确很难
and that is a really big leap for a 21st century girl.

928
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:49,410
我只是希望你能意识到这点
I just want you to appreciate that.

929
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:50,410
好吗？
OK?

930
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,340
他就在那
There it is.

931
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:58,040
上帝
Oh, my God.

932
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:06,090
来了
All right. What now?

933
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:11,430
- 哦  - 你这个笨蛋！
- Ohh.  - Treacherous old fool!

934
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:16,870
这是谁？
What is this?

935
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:18,240
我看见她死去了
WZARD: I thought you smote her dead.

936
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:19,370
她不是罗莎琳德
She's not my Rosalind.

937
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:21,430
我是 朱丽娅 玛菲特
I'm Julia Malfete. Hi.

938
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,600
哦 玛菲特家族的！
Oh. Malfete!

939
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:24,910
她是后裔！
She's a descendant!

940
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:27,940
所有的都还在
Ah! All is not lost, my lord.

941
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:30,210
你的魔法还要准备多久
How long until your magic is ready...

942
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:32,520
把我送回我的时代？
to return me to my rightful time?

943
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:34,420
在太阳下山之前
Before the sun is set.

944
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:38,120
现在去接安德鲁
Then let us go now and fetch my faithful servant.

945
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:45,590
不应该是这个味道
Never smelled like this before.

946
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:05,380
愚蠢的英国巫师
Bloody English wizards.

947
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:07,080
现在什么都干不了
They cannot do anything right.

948
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,060
- 我喜欢你的战车  - 谢谢
- I like your chariot.  - Thank you.

949
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:24,600
那是我的唇膏
That's my lipstick.

950
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:28,440
哦 别这样 好恶心
Ohh, no,Andre. That's so gross.

951
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,210
马上扔了
Hurry up. Spit it out the window.

952
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:38,150
一块红宝石
One ruby.

953
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:40,090
就是这个
That should do it.

954
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:51,770
两万五
25,000.

955
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,610
你们干吗？
Whatis all this horrible noise?

956
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,110
我们要买东西
We would love to go shopping.

957
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,020
哦 大天鹅！
Oh, big swans!

958
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:27,730
哦！微型战车
Oh! Very small chariots!

959
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:30,470
就像火柴盒
Like little Matchbox cars.

960
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:32,000
- 啊！ - 嘿！
- Aaagh!  - Hey!

961
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,010
说“CHEESE”[奶酪]
Say cheese.

962
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:40,070
我喜欢这个蛋糕
I love these wheel cakes.

963
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,640
我们叫它甜甜圈
ANGELIQUE: Ha! We call them doughnuts.

964
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,680
要多少有多少
Andre, you can have as many doughnuts as you want now.

965
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:46,980
好
Mmm. Yes.

966
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:50,150
所有这些 都可以是你的
You can have all of this, Andre.

967
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:52,890
你可以有一个大房子
You could go out and get a really big house.

968
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:54,590
一个游泳池
And you can have a swimming pool.

969
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:56,830
你能拥有所有的一切
You can have everything, Andre.

970
00:59:56,870 --> 00:59:59,830
我只能拥有我主人允许的东西
I can only have what my master allows.

971
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:01,890
那不是真的！
That is not true!

972
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:05,870
这是民主国家 这是在美国
This is a democracy. This is America.

973
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:09,740
你是一个自由的人
You are a free man.

974
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,340
谢谢
Thank you.

975
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,780
这个时代 有很多有意思的东西
There are a lot of good things about living in this time.

976
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:20,510
你也可以留在这儿
You'll be OK here.

977
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,220
我确定
I'll make sure of it.

978
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:25,720
你很勇敢 朱丽娅
You are lionhearted, Julia...

979
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,230
跟你的血统一样
Like the women of your lineage.

980
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:29,790
你很有勇气
You have courage.

981
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,700
勇敢 不
Lionhearted. No.

982
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:35,730
不 我不这么认为
No, I don't think so.

983
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:37,900
也许吧
Bunny hearted maybe, but no.

984
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:41,530
到外边来
Come outside.

985
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:44,050
你需要懂得保护自己
You will learn to protect yourself.

986
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:47,980
你想干吗？
What are you doing?

987
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,840
看着我
Look at me.

988
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:54,620
照做
Take it like this.

989
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,890
赐予我力量吧
Power in your arm.

990

我受够了
I am getting so tired of this.

996
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:56,150
总要偷鸡摸狗的
Sneaking around and lying all the time.

997

Hang in there with me, babe. We are so close.

999
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,490
带我去跳舞
Take me dancing.

1000
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:25,550

真的吗？
Really?

1037
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:21,460
如果你把你的头发再修修
And if you got a decent haircut...

1038
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:23,690
并且别把你看到的
and learned not to put everything you see...

1039
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:24,790
都往嘴里塞
in your mouth...

1040
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:27,460
那你会成为一个真正的王子
I think you'd be a terrific man.

安德鲁
Andre...

1043

你说我们辞掉工作如何

1044
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:36,180
去环游世界

1045
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:38,180
- 辞掉工作？ - 我们会很快乐

就今天 去跟你的老板说 你要辞职？
Tonight, just tell your boss that you quit, OK?

1047
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:43,050
好的
OK.

1048
01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:44,990
- 自由  - 自由！

没错！
You've got that right, baby!

1051
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:55,730
主人 你看上去很郁闷
Master. You are worried.

1052
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,920
怎么了？
What is wrong?

1053
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:59,160
巫师死了
The wizard...he exploded.

1054
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:03,570
是的 的确很不幸
Yes. It wasn't a very pretty sight.

1055
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:09,640
巫师消失了？
The wizard exploded?

1056
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:15,550
我什么都不知道
Well, I don't know about you guys...

1057
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:17,280
晚安
but good night.

1058
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,750
但首先
But first...

1059
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:21,280
安德鲁有话要对瑟伯特说
Andre has something to say to Thibault.

1060
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,550
什么？
What is it, peasant?

1061
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,430
说啊
Well, speak.

1062
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,700
没什么
Nothing. I guess I was wrong.

1063
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:53,880
瑟伯特 当他站在河边的时候
Thibault, he was standing by the river.

1064
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:57,920
是我见过最美的风景
The saddest, most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.

1065
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,980
好
Hmm. Well...

1066
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:02,830
那个瑟伯特的确是一个特殊的人
that Thibault really is a special guy.

1067
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:06,630
没错 他是
Yes. Yes, he is.

1068
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:10,970
所以我要把所有的财产归还给他
That's why I've decided to give the entire estate back to him.

1069
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:13,070
什么？
You what?

1070
01:06:13,110 --> 01:06:17,140
亲爱的 你知道吗 在我的家族中
Honey, did you know that the women of my lineage...

1071
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:20,410
女人都是很勇敢的
are all lionhearted?

1072
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:25,350
还没处理好吗？
They still haven't brought the stiff down?

1073
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:27,650
我听说那个老头被分成好几部分了
I heard somebody say the old geezer's body parts...

1074
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:28,920
粘在地板上
are sticking to the ground.

1075
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:44,140
我要把我的身体合并回去
Best I pull myself together.

1076
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,750
快点
Come on, my little ones.

1077
01:07:13,870 --> 01:07:16,500
现在舒服多了
Well,that feels better.

1078
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,510
我能进来吗？
Can I come in?

1079
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:24,140
你都查到什么了？
What do you got?

1080
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:26,170
指纹对不上
Finger prints don't match.

1081
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:29,380
不管你的朋友是谁 他都不是瑟伯特
Whoever your friend is, he's not this Thibault Malfete...

1082
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:32,010
他已经在三年前的意外中升天了
that died in that sailing accident three years ago.

1083
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:33,540
干的不错
I knew it.

1084
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:37,660
我们应该马上把他送到警察局
This is how we're gonna sell it to the cops.

1085
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:43,460
- 你好  - 哦
- Ah, hello.  - Oh, my...

1086
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,190
别感到奇怪
WZARD: Well, don't look so astonished.

1087
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:46,790
这就是魔法
It's magic.

1088
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,390
我所做的只是…
All I did was cast a little...

1089
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:51,230
哦 你好 我的朋友
Oh. Good day, my lord.

1090
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:53,440
我真的很抱歉
I do apologize...

1091
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,710

1093
01:07:58,610 --> 01:08:00,010

1094
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:06,710
当心
Be careful.

1095
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,310
当心 如果你碰到它
If you get that on you...

1096
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,190
就会全身长毛
you'll grow fur.

1097
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,330
乡巴佬！
Peasant!

1098
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:20,600
乡巴佬！
Peasant!

1104
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:35,410
我已经没有牵挂
I do not have any beloved home.

1105
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:37,350
我不想和你回去
I don't want to go back with you.

1106
01:08:37,390 --> 01:08:40,350
我再不想跟在你后边跑
I don't want any more to run behind your horse.

1107

1110

1111
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:51,060
我想…

他不喜欢这个酒

如果他不想喝 早说不就完了
