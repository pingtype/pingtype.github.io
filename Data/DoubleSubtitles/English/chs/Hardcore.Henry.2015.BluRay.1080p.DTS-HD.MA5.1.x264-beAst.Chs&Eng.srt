207
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,610
你朋友阿肯有个重要的俄国联络人

All you gotta do is break in there, kill him,

212

你不用吃他的心脏

亨利 阿肯已经开始了
Henry. Akan's already started.

230
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,070
如果我们不阻止他 他很快就会有一支军队
If we don't stop him, he'll have his army in days or sooner.

231
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,740
你是一半机器 一半怂包
You're half machine, half pussy.

232

你不是唯一被阿肯害的
You're not the only one wronged by Akan.

283

你和我都有同一个目标

别担心她 亨利

没想到还会见到你

00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:33,410
好吗？

353
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:34,530
这他妈可不好

354
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:36,200
- 那些家伙是什么人  - 好是什么意思

355
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,660
- 你在叫我们放松吗  - 他在叫我们放松

356
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,540
- 亨利？亨利是谁  - 你看到楼上的事没

我很抱歉你们很难过 好吗
I'm sorry you're upset, okay?

358
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,670
你他妈在看什么

359
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,340
亨利和我要去对付阿肯
Henry and I are gonna go deal with Akan.

360
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,270
亨利？谁是亨利

- 你看到楼上的事没  - 你看到你干了什么没

362
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,170
- 你真是个白痴  - 我们和你们一起去干死他们

363
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:49,130
- 你知道你造成了什么痛苦吗  - 那个白发怂包死定了

364
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:49,670
他们要为此付出代价

365
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,810
你们要开摩托吗 你们能开摩托去
You wanna go on a the bike? You can go on a the bike.

366
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:52,710

367
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,580
好的 开你们的摩托去 该死的

368
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,550
有时候同意会让事情变得更容易

369
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:51,870
亨利 接好

376
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:50,890
要是我把这一刻放进一杯茶中
If I took this moment and put it in a cup of tea,

377
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:52,530
我连糖都不用加了
I wouldn't need sugar.

378
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:54,990
尤里 有劳了

俄国每年有十万根棒球棍售出
Each year, 100,000 baseball bats are sold in Russia

381
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,160
而棒球 最多五十个
and, at most, 50 baseballs.

382
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:33,670
这让你对伟大俄国的休闲活动有了个主意
Gives you an idea of a great Russian pastime.

383
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,530
这是一根稀有的残存球棍
This is a rare surviving bat.

384
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:39,840
艾丝黛尔
Estelle.

385
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:43,950
你能行行好站起来吗

386
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:52,720
还是你想代替她？
Or do you want to take her place?

387
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:56,820
艾丝黛尔 你男人真是个白衣骑士
Estelle, your boy's quite the white knight,

388
00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:01,060

389
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:05,930

390
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:08,800
你确定吗 亨利
Are you sure, Henry?

391
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,700
你确定吗
Are you sure?

392
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:14,690
我没听到说不

393

…怂包
...pussy.

399
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,180
先生们 请去查看下

400
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,960
不许动

401
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:20,040
给和平一个机会 兄弟们
Give peace a chance, brothers.

402
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,340
我的自我想杀了你们 但我的高我并不想
My ego wants to kill you But my higher self doesn't.

403
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:26,850
天呐 宝贝 我在和那家伙说话呢
Jesus, baby. I was talking to that man.

404
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,770
看
Look at this.

405
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:48,230
这家伙有个记忆阻断器
Dude's got a memory blocker.

406
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:51,870
我只能为你做这些了 伙计
Well, that's about all I can do for you, mate.

407
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:54,070
该重启了
Time for a reboot.

408
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:57,080
十五分钟后见 但愿可以
See you in about 15 minutes, hopefully.

409
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:16,930
嘿
Hey.

410
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,400
他醒了
He's awake.

411
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,970
你的双眼或许有点很模糊
Your eyes might be a bit blurry.

412
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,440
那只是你的景深感觉在试图校准
It's just your depth perception trying to calibrate, yeah?

413
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:28,940
跟我走
Follow me as I walk, yeah?

414
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:31,280

Get up.

好了
All right.

417
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:39,220
你对着我这边 聚得了焦吗
Now, can you focus on me over here?

418
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:41,290
可以吗
Yeah?

419
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,430
埋葬你 就好比埋葬财宝
Burying you. It's like burying treasure.

420
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:51,260
真不明白阿肯怎么想的 因为…
I really don't understand what Akan is thinking because...

421
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,110
亨利 别晃悠了 你快到了 伙计
Henry, stop dicking around. You're almost there, mate.

422
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,550

Here's where you gotta get to. Chop Chop.

423

别危及我的实验室
Don't compromise my lab.

426
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:42,880
让他们离开
Let them leave.

427
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:47,410
宝贝 呕反射是心理上的 都是你脑子里的

428
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:51,270
亨利 不要 我命令…妈的
Henry, no. I'm instructing... shit.

429
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,950
离开

430
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:25,040
干得好 查理·布朗森

开灯
Lights up.

谢谢你 先生 我对士兵做了脑叶切断术
Thank you, sir. I've lobotomized everything not essential...

436
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:20,660
切除了所有不必要的东西
not essential to soldiers.

437

个人记忆 语音 味觉…
Personal memories, speech, sense of taste...

情感激励的问题…
an issue with emotional motivation, which...

440
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,770
激励？试试你的薪水 杰姆斯
Motivation? Try your fucking paycheck, James.

441
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:35,370
我的薪水…好的

开门 请开门
Open the doors! Please! Open the door!

机能失常了 让我出去 求你了 我会修正的
We've got a malfunction! Let me out, please! Uh, I'll fix it.

446
00:56:58,130 --> 00:56:59,770
我对此表示怀疑
I doubt it.

447
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,740

杰米 打断脊柱这种事
You know, Jimmy, something about a spine snapping...

It sounds like...

451
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:22,250
结尾 开头 还是它们都一样？
The end, the beginning. Or are they the same?

452

请坐 亨利
Have a seat, Henry.

453

一个男人残废后 所有人的脑海里
When a man is first crippled, there's always one question on

454
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:31,300
总会有一个问题 尤其是他的…
everyone's mind, especially his...

455
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,170
他的鸡巴还能用吗
does his dick work?

我的不能用了 所以我计划逃离这把椅子
Mine didn't, so I plotted my escape from this chair.

阿肯是个疯子 但我的研究有了资助
Akan's a megalomaniac, but my research was funded.

我一直盯着诺贝尔奖
I kept my eyes on the Nobel Prize.

461
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:58,310
有钱 鸡巴又能用时 谁有空在意恶心的道德伦理
Who has time for icky ethics when he's rich and his cock works, eh?

462
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:02,190
我付出了高昂的代价
I paid a high price.

463
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:07,070
我停止了制造士兵 然后我成功了
I stopped making soldiers and then I succeeded.

464
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:11,200
我培育了用半机体肉身做的人
I grew men made of cyber flesh. Really.

465
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:13,410
就是高级假体做的 但千万别告诉…

Now, cyborgs, on the other hand, have bits and a brain.

468
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,780
他们独立思考 至少理论上是这样
They think for themselves, in theory at least.

469
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:25,380
我能看看你吗
Shall we have a look at you?

470
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:30,290
那个嬉皮士 总抽大麻
That hippie, always with the ganja.

471
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,420
(已连接新设备)
你没抽吧
You're not baked, are you?

472
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:33,630
但愿没
Hope not.

473
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:35,290
好了
Right.

474
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:39,870
你太棒了 亨利
You are the man, Henry.

475
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:45,030
当然 没剩多少真实人体了
Mm, there's very little actual man left, of course.

00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:49,710
骨骼肌肉系统都增强了 心血管涡轮
Enhanced skeletal muscular systems, cardiovascular turbo

由锔二四四原子电池驱动
boosted with a curium 244 atomic battery.

478
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:57,620
晚上好好睡一觉  你能驱动一艘航空母舰
A good night of sleep and you'd power an aircraft carrier.

479
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:01,490
非凡的技术 对吗
Remarkable technology, is it not?

480
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,500
(初始化)
不是你
... Not you.

481
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:07,300
是我的孩子们
My boys.

482
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:10,890
我制造了最初几个来复仇 但后来我开始了
I made the first few for revenge but then I started

483
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:13,700
自我新层面的探索 我能抿一口吗
exploring new aspects of myself. Can I have a sip?

484
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:20,230
过去几年 我过上了真正的生活 亨利
I have lived these past years, Henry.

485
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:24,240
我的小伙子们 他们收到了超速罚单
My lads, they get speeding tickets, they walk barefoot

486
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:27,740
赤脚走在草地上 还滚了床单
through the grass, and boy, do they get laid.

487
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,240
你绝猜不到 我们独自在这时会做什么
You'll never guess what we do here sometimes alone.

488
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:37,500
按播放 在那边 去吧
Hit play. Over there. Go on.

489

我爱你入骨

490
00:59:54,670 --> 01:00:00,520
你就在我心深处
 I got you deep in the heart of me

491
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:04,520
你如此深入我心
 So deep in my heart

492
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:08,230
成了我真实的一部分

我爱你入骨

我不想放弃
 I tried so not to give in

495
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:27,270
我告诉自己此等情事
 I say to myself this affair

496
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,340
永不会一帆风顺
 never will go so well

497
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:34,810
可我为何要抗拒
 Why should I try to resist

498
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:38,430
我明明知道

我爱你入骨
 I got you under my skin

502
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:57,570
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

503
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:01,010
闭上眼睛 你有些问题 伙计
Close your eyes. Something's wrong with you, mate.

504
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:02,810
别担心 不是癌症 淋病什么的
Don't worry, it's not cancer the clap or nothing.

505
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:05,840
只是要你坐到这椅子上
Just gonnagotta sit you down in this chair and take a look

506
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:09,920
检查下你 扫描器说 你极为危险
at you, yeah? The scan says you're in terrible danger.

507
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:17,180
你个该遭千刀万剐的叛徒 你个骗人的畜生
Of being shivved for being a traitor, you lying grasser!

508
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:21,660
我要把你关闭 伙计
I'm shutting you down, mate.

509
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,140
把原型体宝宝放下
Put down the proto baby.

510
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:04,840
快
Now!

511
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,440
我们即使知道你向阿肯
We tried to unplug you nicely even though we knew that you

512
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,980
进行了视讯传输 也还想友好地关掉你
beamed your video to Akan.

513
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:15,710
没有？
No?

514
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,420
这是什么
What's this?

515
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:19,990
那是什么
What's that?

516
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:24,090
你向阿肯传输了
You're broadcasting it that to Akan!

517
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:27,530
够了
Enough!

518
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,600
够了
Enough.

519
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:33,530
即使我相信你 我还是要…
Even if I did believe you, you still have to...

520
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,040
该死 亨利 别

你把他们带到我实验室了 我竟然信任你
You brought them to my lab! I trusted you!

523
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,020
亨利 请你杀了我 阿肯不会杀我
Henry, please kill me? Akan won't.

524
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:54,790
他会让我活在这身腐烂的
He'll make me live in this straightjacket of rotten,

525
01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:58,990
有着恶臭皮肤的束衣中 我之前到底在想什么
smelly skin! What the fuck was I thinking that

526
01:02:58,990 --> 01:03:01,690
阿肯的玩具机器人是我朋友？
Akan's toy robot was my friend?

527
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,700
谢谢你 亨利
Thank you, Henry.

528
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:13,740
也去你妈的 但谢意占多数
Fuck you, too, but mostly thanks.

529
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:18,110
我的实验室处于危险之中 但我能用阿肯的
My lab's compromised, but I can build a new one using Akan's

530
01:03:18,110 --> 01:03:24,720
设备造一个新的 我们一起去救你妻子就行了 对吗
equipment when we go get your wife together, right?

531
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:31,720
嘿 把那放置在墙上
Hey, put that on the wall.

532
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:34,930
我要是无法拥有我的实验室 那没人能拥有她
If I can't have my lab, no one's having her.

533
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:37,530
别丢了这东西
Now, don't lose this.

534
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:43,490
去你妈的 阿肯
Fuck you, Akan.

535
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:46,210
别改频道
And don't change your channel.

536
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:47,870
我们来了
We're coming right over.

537
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:08,690
好了 我数到有六辆车
Right, I counted six vehicles.

538
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:11,100
至少有三十五个人
That's at least 35 men.

539
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,200
在他们进入旅馆前 我们得把他们的人数减半
We've gotta cut them down to half that before they enter the

540
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,540
那样我们才有机会一战 活着出去
hotel to give us a fighting chance to get out alive.

541
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:20,840
还有 喜欢音乐剧的家伙都会
Also, there's a certain stigma attached to blokes who

542
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:23,840
被扣上某个污名 现在我只想说清楚
like musicals. I just wanna get it out there right

543
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:26,750
我直得跟箭一样 明白吗
now that I'm straight as an arrow. Got it?

544
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:28,950
他们来了
Here they come.

545
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:37,260
等等
Wait for it.

546
01:04:38,530 --> 01:04:40,190
等等
Wait for it.

547
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:41,890
就现在
Now.

548
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:53,690
好了 掩护我
Right, cover me.

549
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:23,070
该死 他们在旅馆里了
Fuck, they're in the hotel.

550
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:25,840
我们也不再需要狙击手了
We don't need the sniper anymore either.

551
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:28,610
进去 会见上校
Go inside. See the colonel.

552
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,650
这里 小伙子 全副武装起来
Over here, laddie. Arm yourself to the teeth.

553
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:43,120
别碰这个 埃玛济是我的
Don't touch that. Emma Gee is mine.

554
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:46,360
我父亲曾说
That's what my father used to say...

555
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,660
一天一颗手榴弹 牵制住敌人
'A grenade a day keeps the enemy at bay.'

556
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:51,240
来吧 快
Come along. Chop, chop.

557
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,670
大萨利
Big Sally.

558
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:03,080
家是战争所在的地方
Uh, well, home is where the battle is.

559
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:13,090
好了 列兵 我们的职责是保证残疾人士不受伤害
Right, private, it is our duty to ensure that no harm comes

560
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:14,350
明白吗
to the cripple, understood?

561
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:16,660
跟好了
Follow on.

562
01:06:32,810 --> 01:06:35,210
你能听见他们 但你打不到
If you can hear them, but you can't shoot them,

563
01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:38,460
或许你能炸他们 剥个鸡蛋扔下去 小伙子
you can probably grenade them. Drop an egg down there, laddie.

564
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,050
前进
Forward.

565
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:50,890
来
Come along.

566
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:53,260

Good lord, how embarrassing.

567
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:01,070
刚躲过了一发子弹
Dodged a bullet on that one.

568
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:08,270
我掩护你
I'll cover you.

569
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,880
你跑向他们
You go around them.

570
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:36,600
别让残疾人士倒在你的脚下 小伙子
Don't let the cripple get below you, laddie!

571
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:18,140
很好
Jolly good.

572
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,910
等下  来帮下残疾人士
Hold on, wait. Help me with the cripple.

573
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:40,830
我一示意 你就退后五步 小伙子
Retreat five paces back on my command, laddie.

574
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:48,900
一个残疾人住在一个破地方

575
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:54,030
谢谢你 尤里 我的总部其实在上面
Spasibo, Yuri. My quarters are actually up there.

576
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:56,340
你们想看看吗
Would you like to see them?

577
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:57,440
我们会看的
Oh, we will.

578
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,080
确实会
Indeed.

579
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,200
开足马力
Don't spare the horses.

580
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:28,510
走下一个滑道
Take the next slipway.

581
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,110
就那边
Off, here. Here we go.

582
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:41,250
稳住 小伙子
Hang on, laddie.

583
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:43,290
我们来扭转局面 干翻那些混蛋
Let's turn the tables on these buggers.

584
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,360
呔嗬
Tally ho.

585
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:05,510
大本钟
Big Ben.

586
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:30,600
阿肯是个贱货
Akan is a cunt!!

587
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:44,250
天呐
Oh, my.

588
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:47,090
看来阿肯已经开始了
Looks like Akan's already begun.

589
01:11:48,190 --> 01:11:50,360
最迟明天  那些可怜家伙就会变成
By tomorrow, these poor chaps will be super

590
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:54,400
你这样的超级机器人士兵 当心
robotic soldiers like yourself. Look out!

591
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:16,100
什么是红色的而且对你的牙齿不好

592
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:21,520
站起来 小伙子
On your feet, lad.

593
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:26,360
你左边
On your left.

594
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,730
等下
Hang on.

595
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:39,140
我帮你争取些时间
I'm gonna buy you some time!

596
01:12:45,010 --> 01:12:46,180
封上门
Seal the door.

597
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:53,590
你不知道我有多少次都梦见
Can't tell you the number of times I've dreamt that I was

598
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:56,350
自己乘着这电梯上楼
riding up in this lift.

599
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,390
真遗憾 我不能…
It's a pity I can't...

600
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,500
起落装置而已 小伙子
It's just the landing gear, laddie.

601
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:07,030
现在 听我说
Now, listen to me.

602
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:10,800
等你杀了阿肯  我要你直视他的眼睛
When you kill Akan, I want you to look him right in those eyes

603
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,940
直到他身体其他地方 都死透了 明白吗
until the rest of him is just as dead as they are, understood?

604
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:20,550
不行  我恐怕不能跟你一起去了
No, I'm afraid I shall not be coming with.

605
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:25,320
但你让我带你走了这么远 这给了一个老兵
But you letting me get you this far has given an old sweat his

606
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:28,450
他一生中最盛大的礼物
grandest gift in all his years.

607
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:33,390
别
No.

608
01:13:33,390 --> 01:13:36,430
卡在他的颈静脉里了
It's lodged in his jugular.

609
01:13:36,430 --> 01:13:39,630
如果你拔出 我就没法…
If you uncork it, I won't be able to...

610
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:42,300
那个…
The...

611
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,300
你口袋里的那个啥 快
the thingamajig in your pocket, quickly.

612
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:50,780
我恐怕要坦白些事
Afraid I have a confession to make.

613
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:53,450
瞧 我监视阿肯好多年了
See, I've been surveilling Akan for years.

614
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:57,550
所以当你摔落到那条车道上 如此精彩地
So when you dropped down onto that roadway and went rogue so

615
01:13:57,550 --> 01:14:01,750
出手相向时 我所看到的是我美好的复仇机会
magnificently, well, all I saw was a nice my shot at revenge.

616
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,360
迪米奇的事 你证明了我是对的 然后在森林…
You proved me right with Dimitry, but then in the forest,

617
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,760
我注意到了一个植入物
well, I noticed an implant.

618
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:13,910
一个记忆阻断器 明白吗
A memory block, see?

619
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:17,770
我承受不起让你想起在别处
And I couldn't afford to have you remember a better life

620
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:21,110
有过美好生活的代价 所以我就留它在里面了
somewhere else. So I left it in.

621
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:24,630
我恐怕那样很不光彩
Not my finest hour, I'm afraid.

622
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:30,600
但之后在我的实验室里 我试图分析
But then back at my lab when I was trying to analyze

623
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:34,140
你能为我做什么的时候
what you could do for me,

624
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:39,390
我意识到了 你对我来说…
I realized who you are...

625
01:14:39,390 --> 01:14:41,830
是什么人 亨利
to me. Henry.

626
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:52,950
有个朋友真的很棒 亨利
It's bloody nice having a friend, Henry.

627
01:14:58,310 --> 01:15:03,670
你会认为那些死 会让我对此做好了准备
You'd think all those deaths would've prepared me for this.

628
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:08,350
如果你还没有
If you haven't already,

629
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:12,920
你现在就要开始想起你过去的时刻 亨利
you'll start to remember bits from your past now, Henry.

630
01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:19,560
那些记忆 它们是真实的
And those memories, they're real.

631
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:21,870
它们是你
They're you.

632
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,200
相信它们
Trust them.

633
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:03,860
记忆 记忆 记忆
Memories, memories, memories.

634
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:10,240
我的第一批半机体士兵
My first batch of cyber soldiers.

635
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:15,990
他们大脑的残存部分 被上传了你今天
With everything that you have experienced today uploaded into

636
01:16:15,990 --> 01:16:21,230
所经历的一切 他们只记得在实验室里醒来
what's left of their brains, all they remember is waking up in

637
01:16:21,230 --> 01:16:24,700
他们的妻子在给他们旋上腿
the lab with their wife screwing their legs on.

638
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:30,240
我爱你 查理
I love you, Charlie.

639
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:35,270
我爱你 爱德华
I love you, Edward.

640
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:39,940
我爱你 托马斯
I love you, Thomas.

641
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:43,380
你认得这个吗
You recognize these?

642
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,250
不认得？
No?

643
01:16:46,650 --> 01:16:48,390
奇怪
That's odd.

644
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:51,420
是你妻子的
They're your wife's.

645
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:56,790
我闻得出你喜欢她些什么
Mm, I smell what you like about her.

646
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,500
这一个就快为你做好准备了
This one is almost ready for you.

647
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,030
但我提醒你
But I'm warning you,

648
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,440
他们的推动器让你的那个…
their boosters make the one you have now...

649
01:17:09,610 --> 01:17:11,610
看上去像块该死的九伏电池
You look like a fucking 9 volt.

650
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:13,880
上 狠狠干他
Go ahead and fuck him up.

651
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:16,750
起来
Get up.

652
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:18,050
起来
Get up!

653
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:22,820
肾上腺素

654
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,100
你能应对这个吗
Can you handle this?

655
01:23:40,670 --> 01:23:42,030
亨利
Henry.

656
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:53,240
你干嘛打你自己呢 亨利
Why are you hitting yourself, Henry?

657
01:23:56,180 --> 01:23:57,680
嗯？
Hmm?

658
01:24:10,730 --> 01:24:13,460
宝贝 宝贝 你没事吧
Baby? Baby, are you okay?

659
01:24:13,470 --> 01:24:16,200
我喜欢你对我那么呵护
I love how protective you are of me.

660
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:25,380
你欠我一个道歉
You owe me an apology.

661
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:26,940
什么道歉
For?

662
01:24:28,410 --> 01:24:30,350
怀疑我的道歉
Doubting me.

663
01:24:30,850 --> 01:24:33,150
我是有一定忧虑
I did have certain apprehensions.

664
01:24:33,150 --> 01:24:35,090
那你为什么让我那么做
Why'd you let me do it?

665
01:24:35,090 --> 01:24:38,890
只是为了满足我女人 我失去了所有手下
I was just entertaining my woman and losing all of my men.

666
01:24:40,130 --> 01:24:41,960
所有人都死了吗
Is everybody dead?

667
01:24:43,930 --> 01:24:45,960
- 是的  - 是的
- Yes.  - Yes.

668
01:24:45,970 --> 01:24:48,330
你知道我什么时候意识到这能成的吗
Do you know when I realized this was working?

669
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:49,340
什么时候
When?

670
01:24:50,050 --> 01:24:54,810
亨利把我拉进他逃生舱 不惜一切
When Henry pulled me into the escape pod, trying to get me out

671
01:24:54,810 --> 01:24:57,210
想把我弄出实验室的时候
of the lab no matter what.

672
01:24:57,210 --> 01:25:01,010
谁会想到那怂包会是个该死的激励者
Who would've thought that pussy is a hell of a motivator?

673
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:09,530
我们明天会有数百个你 下周数千个
We'll have a hundred of you tomorrow, a thousand next week.

674
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:14,190
每一个的第一个记忆都会是他的妻子
Each one's first memory will be his wife

675
01:25:14,190 --> 01:25:18,120
把一枚廉价的铜戒戴在他的手指上
slipping a cheap brass ring on his finger.

676
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:21,500
我的每一个士兵 醒来都会愿意
Every single one of my soldiers will awake willing to do

677
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:26,840
做我聪明的妻子要求做的任何事 无论是进军到
anything my brilliant wife tells him, whether it's marching on

678
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:29,870
巴黎还是白宫草坪
Paris or the White House lawn.

679
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:33,340
我会假装你理解你所扮演的角色
I would like to pretend you understand the part you played.

680
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,250
你没有创造历史 亨利
You didn't make history, Henry.

681
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:39,320
而是帮忙结束了
You helped end it.

682
01:25:54,430 --> 01:25:55,870
你个…
You...

683
01:25:56,330 --> 01:25:57,900
…小…
...little...

684
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:00,170
…怂包
...pussy.

685
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:03,810
我老头就那么称呼我
That's what my old man called me.

686
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,580
就好像那是我的名字
It's like it was my name.

687
01:26:08,110 --> 01:26:11,750
我杀了所有错的人 证明他是对的
And I proved him right by killing all the wrong people.

688
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:19,760
我爱你 亨利 除了你名字外 我从没叫过你别的
I love you, Henry, and I'll never call you anything but your

689
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,290
但你必须决定
name, but you gotta decide...

690
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:25,460
你要躺在那儿 把血咽进嘴里
are you gonna lay there, swallow that blood in your mouth?

691
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:32,940
还是站起来吐掉血 去让他们流血
Or are you gonna stand up, spit it out, and go spill theirs?

692
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:50,190
阿肯
Akan!

693
01:26:50,190 --> 01:26:51,210
你个该死的…
You fuck...

694
01:27:40,110 --> 01:27:41,310
别这样
No!

695
01:27:41,310 --> 01:27:42,570
住手
Stop!

696
01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:45,280
我命令你住手
I am ordering you to stop!

697
01:27:49,310 --> 01:27:50,950
亨利
Henry!

698
01:27:50,950 --> 01:27:52,550
住手
Stop!!!

699
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:28,220
他在哪
Where is he?

700
01:28:33,730 --> 01:28:35,190
不
No.

701
01:28:35,190 --> 01:28:37,490
去你妈的 混蛋
Fuck you, motherfucker!

702
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:38,960
去你妈的
Fuck you!

703
01:28:38,970 --> 01:28:41,330
亨利 你怎么能对我这样
How could you do this to me, Henry?

704
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,700
你他妈怎么能这样
How could you fucking do this?

705
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:45,540
回答我
Answer me!

706
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:47,440
回答我
Answer me!

707
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:54,460
冷静

708
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:56,680
混蛋
Motherfucker!

709
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:06,120
怎么回事 亨利
What happened, Henry?

710
