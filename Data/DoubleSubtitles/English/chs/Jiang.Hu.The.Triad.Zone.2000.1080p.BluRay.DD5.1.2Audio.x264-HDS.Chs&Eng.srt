2
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,450
你们听过江湖这地方吗？
Have you ever heard of Jiang Hu?

3
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,910
别想从地图里找
Don't bother Iooking it up in the atIas

4
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,620
你们一定找不到
You won't find it there

5
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,150
江湖是一个不讲法律的地方
Jiang Hu is a pIace without Iaw

6
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:54,570
那儿只有规矩道义和恩怨
There are onIy ruIes, honor and rivaIries

7
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,950
其实不同的人有不同的江湖
Different peopIe have different Jiang Hu

8
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,610
如果进过我这个江湖的话
If you happen to be in my Jiang Hu

9
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,610
你就一定听过任因久
You must know of Jim Yam

10
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,490
这个响当当的名
He's very famous

11
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,580
没有？
Never?

12
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,110
那你见识太少了
Then you don't know anything

13
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,530
我就是任因久
I'm Jim Yam

14
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,570
江湖人，白羊座
I'm from the underworId. Aries

15
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,490
我负责的社团叫洪宝
I'm in charge of the group Hung Bo

16
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,620
现在我很忙
I'm pretty busy now

17
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,700
在忙什么？
Busy with what?

18
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,030
我正在谈判
I'm negotiating

19
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:02,610
任老久，现在世界变了
Master Yam, the worId has changed

20
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,110
你那套不管用了
Your oId ways don't work anymore

21
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,990
你实在太落后了
You're out of date

22
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,650
看看你…
Look at you ...

23
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,860
知不知道现在的年青人在想什么？
You know what young peopIe think about now?

24
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,830
你懂不懂什么叫上网？
You know what the internet is?

25
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,610
什么叫？lPO？
You know what IPO is?

26
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,740
你知不知道什么叫lPO？
You know what IPO is?

27
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,870
搞网页资讯公司呀
It means setting up IT companies

28
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,740
一个星期筹备
... that can be Iisted on the stock market

29
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,910
六个星期上创业版那种
in Iess than 6 weeks

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,610
这叫做时代步伐
That is the modern way

31
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,830
江山代代有人出
There's aIways a new generation

32
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,450
你已上岸，就退下来吧
You've made it, now make way for us!

33
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,070
我说完了，不再说了
I'm done, I'm finished

34
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,650
你也无话可说吧
And you haven't said anything?

35
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,150
为什么？
Why?

36
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,110
因为我有论点
Because I have a point

37
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,780
大口连，一九九七年六月二十六日
Big Mouth, on 26th June, 1997 ...

38
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,490
在福临门你借了我三十万
... you borrowed $3OO,OOO from me

39
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,150
你有没有还过我一个仙？
But have you ever paid me back?

40
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,000
你竟用这种语气跟我说话？
How dare you taIk to me with this attitude?

41
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,740
那晚你点了两只吉品鲍
That evening, you ordered two expensive abaIones

42
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,120
开了一瓶八二年拉菲
... and opened a bottIe of Lafite of 1982

43
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,040
结单连小费总共一万两千五
The biII to that meaI was $12,5OO

44
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,370
我还没跟你计较
and I haven't asked you to pay the biII

45
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,320
要谈判？
You want to negotiate?

46
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,580
你连本带利还清这笔账才有得谈
We'II taIk when you've paid back your debt, with interest

47
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,120
就这样
That's aII

48
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,650
这件事你没跟我说过
You didn't teII me about this

49
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,450
这时候别跟我说这种话吧
Don't say such things to me now

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,780
我知道，我对大口连砸瓶那件事
I know the news of me hitting Big Mouth with a bottIe ...

51
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,650
不用一晚，就会传遍整个江湖
... wiII spread in the underworId tonight

52
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,320
其实当大哥，有时真要出来做场好戏
But a Triad boss must put on a show from time to time

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,480
目的就是要跟着你的那班手下知道
... to Iet your men know that ...

54
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,370
你还很猛，很活跃
... you're stiII powerfuI

55
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,450
我习惯夜生活，皮肤缺乏健康色素
I'm used to night-Iife, and I Iook paIe

56
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,990
所以我很喜欢晒太阳灯
so I Iove to sunbathe in tanning booths

57
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,030
来保持我的健康肤色
... to keep a heaIthy Iooking tan

58
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,160
他叫阿愉，我的贴身保镖
He's Yue, my bodyguard

59
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,450
亦是我最能打的手下
... and the most IethaI of my men

60
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,530
阿愉以前是甲组球队队员
Yue used to be a Division 1 soccer pIayer

61
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,150
曾夺两届香港足球先生荣誉
& was awarded twice Mr. soccer of HK

62
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,700
他踢球时受伤累累
He had a Iot of injuries pIaying soccer

63
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,370
全身镶上了许多钢片
And he has steeI parts impIanted in his body

64
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,750
所以每次上飞机检查时都会响警钟
At the airport, he aIways sounds the aIarm at the inspection point

65
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,730
不过，也有一点好处
There's an advantage to that

66
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,280
挡子弹时会硬实点
He can shieId me from buIIets more efficientIy

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,450
久哥，这么高兴
Brother Jim, what a night!

68
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,490
看来要庆贺一下
I think we shouId ceIebrate

69
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,700
高兴是应该庆贺的
Yeah, we shouId ceIebrate

70
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,570
去JoJo那边吧
Let's go to Jo Jo's pIace

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,990
师爷伟最了解我
ConseIor Wai understands me the best

72
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,200
他跟我以前，在律师事务所当师爷
He worked in a Iaw firm before working for me

73
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:50,780
我认识他
I met him when my first wife

74
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,490
是因为我跟第一任太太离婚
and I were getting divorced

75
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,370
他居然代表我太太来跟我谈判
He represented my wife against me

76
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,200
结果被我打得鼻肿脸青
... so I beat him up badIy

77
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,290
他很喜欢混黑社会
He Ioves Iife in the underworId

78
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,160
自己已是黑社会
Even though he's a triad member

79
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,690
还买每期古惑仔来看
he stiII reads scoundreIs, the comics

80
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,450
你说怪不怪？
Isn't that strange?

81
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,820
差不多了
That's about it

82
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,230
阿伟，你可以回去了
Wai, you may go home now

83
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,230
是，久哥
Yes, Brother Jim

84
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,530
阿叶，你也收工吧
Yip, you go home too

85
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,540
阿愉，你等我
Yue, you wait for me

86
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,700
是，知道了，久哥
Yes, got it, Boss

87
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,450
JoJo是我的情妇
Jo Jo is my mistress

88
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,070
我是在很偶然机会下认识她
I met her in a taiIor shop

89
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,900
任先生，请问你平常习惯放左边
Mr. Yam, which side do you prefer

90
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,150
还是右边？
Ieft or right?

91
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,320
你真坏
You're naughty!

92
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,610
我左不放右不放，就放你里面
Neither Ieft nor right I prefer it inside you

93
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,990
任因久！
Jim Yam!

94
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,160
你恶贯满盈，我要替天行道
You're eviI, I must act for God

95
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,360
铐你回去！
I must arrest you!

96
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,860
好！你放马过来！
sure, come on!

97
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,120
你以为这样就可捉到我吗？
You think you can catch me?

98
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,160
不要…
No ...

99
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,490
- 救命呀！ - 敢铐我？
- HeIp!  - How dare you?

100
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,280
不铐了…
I dare not ...

101
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,490
我弟弟最近加入黑社会
My younger brother has joined the triad recentIy

102
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,910
还跟了你手下
... and your man is his boss

103
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,400
你给他机会吧
Look after him

104
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,080
阿愉
Yue

105
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,650
你去跟烂口昌说
Go and teII Rod Cheung

106
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,780
他手下停车的咸蛋超有个小子
that Chiu, the vaIet boy has taken a kid

107
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,370
糟了…
Damn ...

108
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,450
叫什么？
What is he caIIed?

109
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,910
反正不是阿威就是阿武
It must be either Wai or Wu, anyway

110
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,990
是不是有人搞他？
Is someone picking on him?

111
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,370
不，他是JoJo的弟弟
No, he's JoJo's younger brother

112
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,490
叫他有位就让他上吧
Promote him when there's an opening

113
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,120
是，知道了，久哥
Yes, got it, Boss

114
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,450
我跟你说过多少次
How many times have I toId you?

115
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,280
是即知道，知道即是
Yes equaIs to got it

116
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,240
车里只有我和你，不用叫久哥了
You needn't caII me Boss when we're aIone

117
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,500
是，知道了，久哥
Yes, got it, Boss

118
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,330
我有情妇，因为我有个老婆
I have a mistress because I have a wife

119
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,870
我有老婆，所以我才有情妇
I have a wife, therefore I have a mistress

120
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,580
这道理，所有男人都明白
And aII men understand that Iogic

121
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,120
女人在我生命中
In my Iife, women ...

122
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,370
绝对不会占百份之十以上
... don't have an important pIace

123
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,410
而这百份之十
And this minor position ...

124
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,120
当然不止由一个女人分享
... must be shared by different women

125
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,110
她是我老婆苏花
she's my wife, sophie

126
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,740
目前正经历人生一个重要阶段
she's at the most criticaI period of her Iife

127
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,530
直接影响到我的健康
... which directIy affects my heaIth

128
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,200
有人叫这阶段做虎狼之年
PeopIe refer this as the Hungry Tigress period

129
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,950
老公，你是不是不行？
Hubby, have you become impotent?

130
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,330
两夫妻的事不怕说嘛
We're a coupIe, you can teII me

131
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,490
我知道你不喜欢
I know you don't Iike that

132
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,610
但我托朋友给你买了两盒威而钢
But I asked my friend to buy you some Viagra

133
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,490
来帮你
They can heIp you

134
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,650
什么不行？
What do you mean?

135
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,870
我就做给你看
I'II show you my power

136
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,780
有些东西，就算多好玩
However much fun a game is ...

137
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,620
做得太多也会觉得辛苦
... you'II tire of it if you pIay it too much

138
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,030
你别看我老婆骚成这样
My wife Iooks fIirtatious now ...

139
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,820
老公…
Hubby ...

140
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,950
在其他人眼中，她却是另一个人
she shows another side in front of other peopIe

141
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,820
你们别当大哥是傻瓜
Don't treat your Boss Iike a fooI ...

142
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,660
想怎样就怎样
... and do whatever you want

143
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,740
阿南，你档子亏了本与大哥何干？
Nam, your faiIing business has nothing to do with the Boss

144
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:47,040
前几年还说，开档时算大哥一份
When you started your business you promised that he wouId be a partner

145
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,120
这两年赚到钱了
But when you made money

146
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,280
也不见你分一仙过来
you never gave him a penny

147
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,950
现在亏了本，就开口向大哥要钱
Now you're Iosing money you want his heIp?

148
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,900
大嫂…
sister ...

149
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,080
戴超！
Thai Chiu!

150
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,900
你伙同外面堂口的人开片
You started a war with a rivaI gang ...

151
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,830
事前有没有通知大哥？
... did you aIert your Boss beforehand?

152
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,570
没有吧
Right?

153
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,080
现在死了人才向大哥大报销
Now you come to cIaim from Boss when someone is dead

154
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,330
那小子我见都没见过
WeII, I have never seen that guy

155
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,910
还是巴基斯坦人
... and he's a Pakistani

156
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,410
你们人人来找大哥便宜
You keep taking advantage of the Boss

157
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,450
他好人，不吭声
He's kind, he never bIames you

158
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:29,370
回来不高兴，就拿我这女人出气
But when he comes home he takes it out on me

159
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:34,040
他明知吃亏，也不责怪你们
He never bIames you even though you cheat him

160
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,320
讲义气嘛
That's honor!

161
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,780
谁最惨？
Who reaIIy suffers?

162
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,280
还不是我这个女人？
Me, I'm the reaI sufferer!

163
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,570
一句话，是不是要我承受？
Just one word, you aII want me to suffer?

164
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,360
大嫂，不是这样的
sister, it's not Iike that!

165
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,780
不是这样就行了
Then it's simpIe

166
00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:01,490
摊开笔账，公公道道算一次
We'II go through the Iedger and settIe it now

167
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,330
阿愉，下去看看什么事
Yue, go and check it out

168
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,330
什么事？
What is it?

169
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,150
什么事？
What is going on?

170
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,870
阿叶，窗子打开一点
Yip, open the window a bit

171
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,910
我是见习督察叶伟信
I'm WiIson Yip, Inspector Trainee

172
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,910
见习是吧？
Trainee?

173
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,070
有件事，我有义务告诉你
There's something I have to teII you

174
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,650
说
shoot

175
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,320
有话大声说吧
say it IoudIy

176
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,370
二十四小时内有人要杀你！
someone wiII kiII you in the next 24 hours!

177
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,490
你疯啦？
Are you crazy?

178
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,700
他叫我大声说的
But he asked me to say it IoudIy

179
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,370
任因久，我跟你说过了
Jim Yam, I have toId you

180
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,700
没什么，想跟你说件事
Nothing, I onIy want to teII you something

181
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,280
自从我任因久出来混
Ever since I have been in the underworId

182
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,700
每天都有人想杀我
... peopIe try to kiII me everyday

183
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,450
但二十多年来，我还活着
But I have survived through the Iast 2O years

184
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,030
伟，看那个见习在哪上班
Wai, check where that trainee works

185
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,610
明天叫人送个水果篮过去
and send a fruit basket to him tomorrow

186
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,790
消息准确吗？
Is the news reIiabIe?

187
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,280
愉，看到那枪手吗？
Yue, you see that sniper?

188
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,610
街口数过来第一幢，白色那座
The first white buiIding

189
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,230
第一个天台右边角落
... from the first right corner on the roof

190
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,830
愉！
Yue!

191
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,530
这枪不响？
This gun doesn't work?

192
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,700
抢枪我还没说你
You snatched my gun without asking

193
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,160
过去一点，很挤
Move over a bit, it's tight

194
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,910
那枪手也不是很准的
That sniper isn't very accurate

195
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,160
不，久哥，很准呀
No, Boss, he's accurate

196
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,650
我中了枪
I got shot

197
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,400
但我顶得住
but I can take it

198
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,280
久哥，现在怎办？
Brother Jim, what shaII we do now?

199
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,450
通知四大公司开会
AIert the 4 organizations for a meeting

200
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,700
我要知道谁跟我过不去
I want to find out who did that

201
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,190
用什么名义？共商善举？
What's the excuse? Charity?

202
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,900
有没有更响亮点？大家想想
Anything grander? Let's think

203
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,480
要不就叱责…
How about ...

204
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,490
急成这样，江湖告急吧！
How about Jiang Hu Gao Ji?

205
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,190
是，知道了，久哥
Yes, got it, Boss

206
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,450
这个名字不错
It's a good name

207
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,000
看来没事，又好像有事
It sounds Iike nothing but couId be something

208
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,700
有事呀警察，报警吧
something is going on, caII the poIice

209
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,820
打电话回你公司叫人吧
CaII your peopIe for heIp

210
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,400
久哥，早
Morning, Brother Yam

211
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,490
早，阿伟
Morning, Wai

212
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,360
行不行？
Is it okay?

213
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,030
漂亮吗？
Looks good?

214
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,080
很好呀
Very good

215
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,950
Versace，当然好
It's Versace, of course it's good

216
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,330
Versace？没见过
Versace? Haven't seen this before

217
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,330
是防弹衣，你当然没见过
It's buIIet-proof you wouIdn't have seen it before

218
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,610
他们有生产防弹衣？
Do they make buIIet-proof jackets?

219
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,530
那防弹衣真是奇丑无比
That oId buIIet-proof jacket was ugIy

220
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,330
我特意买件大码Versace回来改给久哥
so I bought a L-sized Versace to convert it

221
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,370
原来出自嫂子的手笔
sister, you designed it

222
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,450
难怪这么有灵气
No wonder it's so eIegant

223
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,200
如果你大量生产
If you mass-produced it ...

224
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,700
江湖老大人人身穿一件，那就发啦
... and aII the Triad bosses wore one you wouId be rich

225
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,450
苏花连蛋都没下过一只
sophie has never produced one baby ...

226
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,360
你跟她说大量生产？
... and you want her to mass-produce?

227
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,570
你好坏，一大早就挖苦人
You're terribIe, picking on me so earIy

228
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,190
久哥，这么早找我什么事？
Brother Jim, what can I do for you?

229
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,860
没什么，我想问问你的看法
Nothing, I want to get your opinion

230
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,530
现在有人用枪暗杀我
There's an assassin after me

231
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,530
我已派所有兄弟出去打听了
I've sent aII my men out to find out who's behind it

232
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,700
江湖事，我想还是江湖解决吧
I suggest to resoIve it the triad way

233
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,200
我们找到主谋又怎样？
What if we find the person behind it?

234
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,030
把他剁成九块？
shaII we chop him to pieces?

235
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,280
我没好处吧
It doesn't do me any good

236
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,780
都传开了，怎能没有动作？
Everyone knows about this so we must take action

237
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,700
所谓有危就有机
Opportunity comes in dangerous times

238
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,870
我们应该利用这个机会
We shouId make use of this opportunity

239
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,200
你想到办法？
You have a pIan?

240
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,830
还没有，快了
Not yet, but very soon

241
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,120
不如
What if ...

242
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,700
不如就…
What if ...

243
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,700
利用这个机会，排除异己
we use this as an excuse to get rid of our rivaIs?

244
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,570
对
Right

245
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,940
应该利用江湖告急这个会议
We make use of ''Jiang Hu Gao Ji'' meeting

246
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,490
看清楚四大公司的立场
to see where the 4 organizations stand

247
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,110
看看到时谁说话大声过我
Whoever speaks Iouder than me at the meeting

248
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,410
我就说他是主谋
... I'II say he's the conspirator

249
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,280
完全同意
I compIeteIy agree

250
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,530
任老久，你放心吧
Jim Yam, don't worry

251
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,610
只要知道是哪班人干的
Once we know who the pIotter is

252
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,400
我们所有堂口的人都不放过他
... none of our members wiII spare him

253
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,620
现在就是不知哪班人暗算他
We don't even know who wants to kiII him

254
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,490
是想杀他呢
Whether he wants to have him kiIIed ...

255
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,790
还是只想警告他，我们都不知道
... or just to warn him

256
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,820
任老久，我们出来闯的
Jim Yam, we're in the underworId

257
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,040
近来开罪了谁，怎会不知道呢？
You shouId know if you have offended someone recentIy

258
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,150
反正你现在还没死
since you're stiII aIive ...

259
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,400
他们随时会再出击
they may make another attempt at you

260
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,660
到时你来一招引蛇出洞
You can set up traps for them

261
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:46,320
知道了谁干的，便叫齐人马摆平他
and when you know who did it get rid of him

262
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,400
我是最多心的
I'm aIways suspicious

263
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,740
久哥会不会怀疑
Does Brother Jim suspect

264
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:50,980
是我们当中的人干的？
one of us did it?

265
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,200
我老表华发誓，一定没干过
I swear I didn't do it

266
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,190
基哥，你一晚没吭声
Brother Kei, you haven't said anyhing?

267
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,950
平常你很多话的
You usuaIIy have Iots of opinions

268
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,280
是呀基哥，你今晚好安静呀
Right, Brother Kei, you're siIent tonight

269
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,780
没什么，我也遇上了头号杀手
Nothing, I've aIso ran into an kiIIer

270
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,200
我今早看过报告
I read the report this morning

271
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,450
医生也证实了，说我有肺癌
The Doctor has diagnosed me with Iung cancer

272
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,650
争？争什么呢？
so why wouId I compete with you?

273
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,660
多年来，我们都在争地盘
We've been fighting each other for territories aII these years ...

274
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,740
你劈我，我砍你
... in endIess vioIence

275
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:44,440
到头来，我连自己的地盘都没搞好
In the end? I can't even maintain my own territory

276
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,700
我们今天不是讨论争地盘
We're not discussing territories today

277
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,200
我认识一位气功大师，我介绍给你
I know a qigong master I'II introduce you to him

278
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,540
有了，有种果汁，能医百病
Yes, there's a kind of fruit juice that heaIs aII diseases

279
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,490
我找人搬几箱给你试试
I'II send a few boxes for you to try

280
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:57,820
基哥，你放心
Brother Kei, don't worry

281
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,120
以后用得着我老表华，尽管出声
Just teII me if ever you need me

282
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,400
总之我任因久今天在此跟大家说
Let me teII everyone present

283
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,200
如果给我发现是谁跟我过不去
If I find out who stands against me

284
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,290
我一定不放过他！
I wiII not Iet him Iive!

285
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,990
基哥，还有样东西你可以试试
Brother Kei, there's one thing you can try too

286
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,870
西藏雪莲
Tibet snow BIossom

287
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,240
这宝物有病治病，没病强身
It heaIs aII diseases indeed

288
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,280
贵不贵呀？
Is it expensive?

289
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,660
买不到的
It's not for saIe

290
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,540
小子，跟着我干什么？
Hey, why are you foIIowing us?

291
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,860
我来找久哥
I came to see Brother Jim

292
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,120
久哥，我想跟你
Brother Jim, I want to work for you

293
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,990
什么？你是谁？
What? Who are you?

294
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,910
我本来跟大口连的
I used to work under Big Mouth

295
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,530
但上次见你砸他的头
but after I saw you hit him with a bottIe

296
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,690
我觉得他不够份量
I think he's not quaIified

297
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,610
所以我想转堂口
That's why I want to switch

298
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,780
叫什么名？
What's your name?

299
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,910
罗金虎，叫我阿虎行了
Law Kum Fu, just caII me Tiger

300
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,320
你刚出来混的？
You're new to the underworId?

301
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,330
没人教你忠义两个字怎样写？
No one ever taught you about LoyaIty?

302
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:50,030
跟大哥和玩女人有什么分别？
What's the difference between foIIowing a boss and pIaying a woman?

303
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,280
女人你不满意，可以叫她滚
If you're not happy with a woman you can cast her out

304
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,360
她滚慢点还可以飞脚踢她尾龙骨
If she refuses, you can even kick her

305
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,790
可以这样对大哥吗？
But can you do this to your boss?

306
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,160
不懂回答可以问我手下
Ask my men if you don't know the answer

307
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,360
我只知道，现在世界已经变了
I onIy know the worId has aIready changed

308
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,780
你一定想过，如果我不收你你会怎样
You must have considered what wouId happen if I rejected you

309
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,620
我会建议你小心提防
I wouId advise you to be carefuI

310
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,320
因为你一定会后悔
... as you'II definiteIy regret it

311
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,320
说什么？小子！
What do you mean?

312
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,480
不是对你说
I'm not taIking to you

313
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,650
我任因久从没做过后悔的事
I've never done anything that makes me regret

314
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,110
除了一次
... except once

315
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,500
你不用问我，跟你不太熟我不会说
Don't ask, I won't teII you as I don't know you

316
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,730
十三妹！
sister 13!

317
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,070
很久没来打通宵牌了
You haven't come for aII-night mahjong in a Iong time

318
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,790
最近有没有玩切手指？
You stiII pIay the game of cutting fingers?

319
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,080
有，这个月十七八根吧
Yes, I've cut 18 fingers this month

320
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,240
妹姐，是十九根
sister, 19 in totaI

321
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,610
对，忘了你多手呢
Right, I forget you're an octopus

322
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,070
碰！
Pong!

323
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,240
碰！
Pong!

324
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,410
指指划划干什么？
What are you pointing at?

325
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,030
原来没有
Oh, there's nothing

326
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,610
没有就闪开，不然切了你那根
step aside if you have nothing or I'II cut yours off

327
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,780
摸吧
Get one

328
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,660
你这混蛋又来了
This asshoIe is fIipping out again!

329
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,730
叫糊了
Last one for me

330
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,610
这家伙不对劲，先叫救护车
There's something wrong with him send for an ambuIance

331
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,200
是谁？
Who is he?

332
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,780
冰冰旗下的东东
It's Tung Tung, he works for Ping

333
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,990
你没听过他唱歌吗？
You havent' heard him sing?

334
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,280
阿冰，怎么你旗下歌手…
Ping, you mean the singer under your IabeI ...

335
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:07,780
…也能唱歌？
... can reaIIy sing?

336
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:10,990
不，打五万块底的麻将才这样的
No, he's Iike this when he pIays high stakes mahjong

337
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,280
糊牌的话，更可怕呢
He's worse when he wings a hand

338
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,740
可别糊呀，我好的
Don't win, I'm scared

339
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,370
叫糊啦！
Last one for me!

340
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,860
快点吧
Hurry up!

341
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:26,740
糊牌！
Made it!

342
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,320
这么大，糊死你啦
It's a big game

343
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,160
他真的有事呀，叫救护车
There's reaIIy something wrong with him, send for an ambuIance

344
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,900
不…他常常这样的
No ... he's aIways Iike this

345
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,700
久哥，今天我和东东来…
Brother Jim, the reason I come here

346
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,910
其实不是来打牌的
... is not to pIay mahjong

347
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,110
我们有件事…想请你帮帮忙
In fact, we ... want to ask you a favour

348
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:54,820
到底什么事？
What is it?

349
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,830
这件事很长篇很凶险的…
It's a very Iong and dangerous story ...

350
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,070
让我说！
Let me teII it!

351
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,870
他最近被狗仔队跟踪
The paparazzi has been after him

352
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,740
有次进男厕，他见到有个记者
One day he went to a toiIet he saw a reporter

353
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,240
拿着什么针孔镜头，偷拍他撒尿
fiIming him pissing with a micro camera

354
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,450
但我手快，拿东西泼他
I was fast enough to spray him

355
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,870
所以他没拍到我
He didn't get anything of me

356
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,240
狗仔队也是听老板吩咐办事
The paparazzi just take orders from their boss

357
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,070
是的，那老板有问题呀
Right, the probIems came from the boss

358
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,610
知道是哪家？
You know which paper?

359
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,110
查到了
I've checked it aIready

360
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:20,700
那老板是男是女？
Is the boss a man or a woman?

361
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:24,610
男的，有分别吗？
A man, what's the difference?

362
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,110
江湖规矩，男的揍一顿
underworId ruIes, for it's a man we beat him up

363
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:30,780
女人呢？
What if it's a woman?

364
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,240
用屎泼她
We spIash her with shit

365
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:37,450
我想知道，如果不男不女又怎样？
What if he's sort of a transvestite?

366
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,160
揍一顿再用屎泼
Beat him up then spIash him with shit

367
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,360
还有什么问题？
Anyhing eIse?

368
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,990
没有了
No

369
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,860
其实我们当大哥的
Being a boss Iike me ...

370
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,620
真的不能随便乱说话
... shouIdn't say things casuaIIy

371
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,360
我可以举以前一件事做例子
Let me give you an exampIe

372
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,450
要不要我下来把着你的手教你怎做？
Must I hoId your hand and teach you what to do?

373
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,400
发生这种事当然出江湖奸杀令啦
For such a case, of course we'II send men to rape then kiII

374
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,570
我只说一次！
I won't repeat it!

375
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,160
什么？
What?

376
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,910
你好像说了江湖奸杀令
You seem to have said ''a rape then kiII''

377
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,620
什么奸杀令？
What ''a rape then kiII''?

378
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,450
那反骨仔是男的，当然出江湖追杀令
That traitor is a guy, of course

379
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,290
是女的才出奸杀令嘛
We onIy rape and then kiII if it's a femaIe

380
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:27,450
但你的确说了江湖奸杀令嘛
But you did say ''a rape then kiII''

381
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,370
阿愉，我说了什么？
Yue, what did I actuaIIy say?

382
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,940
刚才阿伟说的好像是
You may have said what Wai cIaimed

383
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,730
不过久哥你说不是，又好像不是
since you say you didn't maybe you didn't

384
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:36,910
就是嘛
That's right

385
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,370
不如补多个电话给阿发作实吧
You'd better give Fat a caII to confirm it

386
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,450
这么说，我说错话了？
You mean I made a mistake?

387
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,330
你刚才没听到，我只说一次嘛
Didn't you hear me say I won't repeat it?

388
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,530
你要说，你来打
You want to teII him, you caII

389
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,240
你打给阿发吧，来
Give Fat a caII then, come on

390
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,950
你真的说了奸杀令嘛，久哥
Brother Jim, you reaIIy said ''a rape then kiII''

391
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,200
阿发，你听错了吧
Fat must have misheard it

392
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,150
就算是也不用这么严重吧
Maybe it was a mistake, this is overkiII

393
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,660
很痛的
That hurts

394
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,940
久哥
Brother Jim

395
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,530
亏佬基刚刚在医院死了
Kei just died in the hospitaI

396
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,160
是吗？
Did he?

397
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,500
帮我拿件外套，我们走吧
Get my jacket, Iet's go

398
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,830
要这么快去医院，久哥？
Brother Jim, we're rushing to the hospitaI?

399
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,610
我几时说去医院？
Did I say we were going to the hospitaI

400
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,410
去喝奶茶呀
We're going to have a cup of tea

401
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,150
去哪里喝奶茶？
We're going to have a cup of tea

402
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,780
亏佬基的地头有家奶茶档很出名
There's a good tea-house where Kei used to be

403
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,610
我们平常不去，趁这机会去嘛
We couIdn't go in the past now we can go

404
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,150
快点，走吧
Hurry, Iet's go

405
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,740
虎哥，我们近来很不济呀
Brother Tiger, times are tough these days

406
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,790
过来基哥这边，一点油水也没捞到
We haven't made any money working for Brother Kei

407
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,080
是呀
That's right

408
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,620
我们现在连代客停车也捞不上了
We can't even make money in vaIet parking

409
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,240
阿细昨天抢劫被警案抓走了
sai was arresed of robbing a shop yesterday

410
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,320
我们连五千块保释金也拿不出
We couIdn't even coIIect $5,OOO for his baiI

411
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,580
阿B说想去卖迷幻药
Bee wants to seII ecstasy

412
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,500
但我们也要有本钱呀
But we Iack the capitaI

413
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,490
就这么多，拿去吧
This is aII I have

414
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,280
我再想办法
... I'II think of something

415
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,820
这里除了奶茶，蛋挞也很好
Besides tea, egg tart is aIso good here

416
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,700
以前只能叫外卖
We couId onIy caII for deIivery in the past

417
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,280
今天来吃新鲜
Now we can have them fresh here

418
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,280
先给点吧
Pay and I'II owe you

419
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,660
没有
No money

420
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,450
若大一个人上街，一百几十也没有？
You don't have $1OO? Come on

421
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,690
我全部家当都在这了
AII my beIongings are here

422
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,110
哪够呀？
It's not enough

423
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,320
伙记
Waiter

424
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,950
所有钱都在这，不够等会再还你
AII the money is here I'II get you more Iater

425
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,360
大哥，不是吧？这样不行的
Boss, come on, that won't do

426
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,160
你是怎样当大哥的？
What kind of boss are you?

427
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,360
整班手下都在你面前装死狗
Every time your guys pretend to be poor

428
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,870
你就把所有的全给他们
You give them aII the money you have

429
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,410
我朋友说，他们每晚泡女
My friends say they go chase girIs every night

430
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,450
不知多豪爽
... and they are big spenders

431
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,740
只有你才这样呆头呆脑
OnIy you're stupid enough to beIieve them

432
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,870
人家叫你一声大哥，就晕头转向了
You get high just having them caII you boss

433
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,620
打吧！
Beat me now!

434
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,240
做你女朋友早就准备挨打了
I expect to be beaten being your girIfriend

435
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,030
我现在打电话，拿电话来
I want to make a caII now bring me the phone

436
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,080
没电呀！
No more battery!

437
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,200
伙记
Waiter

438
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,150
是
Yes

439
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,370
那张桌的单算我的
Put that tabIe's biII in on my biII

440
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,990
- 给我奶茶  - 好
- A tea pIease  - Yes

441
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,700
不用说了，我不会让你跟我
No need to say it I won't Iet you work for me

442
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,450
这钱算我先欠你
Then I owe you

443
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,490
一百几十，算了
It's nothing, forget it

444
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,110
做人要算清楚
It's better to keep it cIear

445
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,070
看什么？
What are you Iooking at?

446
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,320
我认得你，踢足球的
I recognize you, you used to be a soccer pIayer

447
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,400
神经病！
Nuts!

448
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,200
我见到这个不知好歹的小女孩
When I saw that feisty IittIe girI

449
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,240
就马上想起我老婆
... I thought of my wife

450
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,150
她以前，是另外一个人
she used to be a totaIIy different person

451
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,160
那时我走投无路，潜到英国
some peopIe were after me I fIed to EngIand

452
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,080
别动！打劫！
Don't move! HoId-up!

453
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,240
不想脊背开两个洞就别动
Don't move if you don't want hoIes in your back

454
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:49,780
Carl！
CarI!

455
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,040
苏花，打劫时别叫我的名字呀！
sophie, don't say my name when we're puIIing a job!

456
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,950
你也叫呀
But you said mine too

457
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:55,280
搜他的身！
search him!

458
00:32:58,450 --> 00:32:59,320
拿去用吧
Take the money, OK

459
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,530
什么？
What?

460
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,870
不用怕，我不打女人的
Don't be afraid, I never beat women

461
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,790
最多用屎泼你
The most I'II do is to spIash women with shit

462
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,070
不过现在没有
But I don't have any right now

463
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,070
你想怎样？
What do you want?

464
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,730
赔我一个饭盒
Buy me a Iunch box as compensation

465
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,940
饭盒？
Lunch box?

466
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,150
我只得一个饭盒
That was the onIy Iunch box I had ...

467
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,910
现在被你打翻了，怎么办？
... and you dropped it

468
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,780
那我请你吃饭吧
I'II treat you then

469
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,030
请我吃饭？
Treat me to a meaI?

470
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:07,040
吃完饭，你就有东西消化
You'II have something to digest after you eat

471
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:10,280
有东西消化，你就有屎泼我了
... then you wiII have shit to spIash me

472
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,490
苏花她真的请我吃饭
sophie reaIIy invited me to Iunch

473
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,650
而且还吃得很痛快
and I enjoyed it very much

474
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,900
简直可以用宾至如归来形容
I can onIy describe it as ''weIcoming''

475
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,830
起初我想食宿靠她
At first I wanted to Iive on her

476
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,400
又因为很久没碰过女人
And because I hadn't touched a woman for a Iong time ...

477
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,200
不如随便一点无所谓吧
... I thought I might be casuaI with her

478
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:35,910
没想到后来…真是随便了
But soon it ... reaIIy became casuaI

479
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,660
苏花
sophie

480
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,950
你有什么人生理想？
Do you have any dreams?

481
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:13,450
我的人生理想…
My dream is ...

482
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:18,900
可不可再来一次？
... that we do it one more time?

483
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,110
别动
Don't move

484
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,320
是个日本仔
It's a Jap

485
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,330
混蛋！去！
Bastard! Go!

486
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,900
进去！
Go inside!

487
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,700
那时候，我们生活还算无忧无虑
We had no worries then

488
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,690
不是吃就是睡
We ate and we sIept

489
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,700
没钱吗？就去抢
We needed money? We robbed

490
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,910
快点
Hurry up

491
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,990
男的面向墙！
Guys face the waII!

492
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,570
女的把东西全拿出来！
GirIs take everything out!

493
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,650
这档子的东西挺多的
That's an interesting staII

494
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,450
对了，大家同声同气
Right, we're feIIow countrymen

495
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,650
是中国人吧？
You're Chinese?

496
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,360
算你便宜点，随便看…
I'II give you a good price, take a Iook ...

497
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,320
这块玉挺有趣
This piece of jade is interesting

498
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,400
不过心形太老套了
The heart shape is a bit oId-fashioned

499
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,110
什么老套呀，大姐？
What do you mean oId fashioned?

500
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,450
你有所不知了
Let me teII you

501
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,440
你听过什么叫人心玉造吗？
Have you heard of Heart of jade?

502
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:36,410
人心肉做我就听过
I've heard of Heart of man

503
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,820
两码事！
They're not the same!

504
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,660
玉造的意思即是矜贵
Jade products are rare and precious

505
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,490
包你大富大贵呀
I guarantee you'II be rich if you owned one

506
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,280
这话中听！
I Iike this pitch!

507
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,190
你喜欢？
You Iike it?

508
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,660
信不信由你
BeIieve it or not

509
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,530
早前唐人街大哥戴了块一模一样的
The triad boss of Chinatown wears one Iike this

510
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,910
一到荷兰，叱咤风云
and he's become a tycoon once he went to HoIIand

511
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,110
发了大财
He made big money

512
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:03,490
所以你们出来混的，不戴块玉不行
You underworId peopIe must have some jade ornaments

513
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:04,940
你怎知道我是出来混的？
How do you know I'm in the underworId?

514
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,400
到了我这把年纪，一眼就看出来了
At my age, I can teII by a gIance

515
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,620
大哥
Boss

516
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:18,950
臭婆娘！抢东西！
Bitch! Robbers?

517
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:26,070
我以为一辈子都要留在伦敦做贼
I thought we'd stay in London and rob forever

518
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,440
没想到天无绝人之路
but the heavens heIped me

519
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:34,110
终于可以回香港了
I can finaIIy return to HK

520
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,830
怎么？仇家给干掉了？
Why? Your rivaIs are dead?

521
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:40,320
我连续买了十期六合彩
I bought 2O consecutive draws on the Iottery

522
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,530
这次要是让我中了金多宝
and I've won the first prize ...

523
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,860
这世界有了钱就可解决困难
With money, we can soIve aII probIems

524
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,240
我要回去重整旗鼓
... I must go back and start over

525
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,730
我要建立自己的堂口，然后…
I must buiId up my own organization and then ...

526
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,070
任因久，我不会让你离开我
Jim Yam, I won't Iet you Ieave me

527
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:24,280
知不知道我最讨厌什么？
You know what I hate most?

528
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,190
什么？
What?

529
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,330
就是被人用刀架着脖子
I hate others putting a knife on my neck

530
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:02,650
你叫苏花，这就是你的主题曲
You're caIIed sophie so this is your song

531
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:01,120
任因久！
Jim Yam!

532
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,070
玩过了就溜！
You Ieave after screwing me?

533
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:06,160
我诅咒你被香港仇家剁成二十九块！
I hope you wiII be chopped up by your rivaIs in HK!

534
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,620
十块喂狗，十块填海！
and they cut your body into pieces!

535
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,450
最后九块削片！削成一片片！
I wish they sIice your muscIe into thin pieces!

536
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:16,490
你这千刀万剐的东西，快去死吧！
You damned bastard why don't you go to heII?

537
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:35,280
用不着这么毒吧
Do you have to be so wicked?

538
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,280
你不是回香港吗？
Haven't you gone back to HK?

539
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,860
哪敢回去呀？
How do I dare?

540
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,900
不怕给人剁成二十九块吗？
I'm afraid my rivaIs wiII sIice me into thin pieces

541
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,620
不要紧的
I don't care

542
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:55,240
换成我，也会回去
I'd return to HK if I were you

543
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,410
我去买了个箱子
I bought a suitcase

544
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,400
让你收拾东西跟我回香港呀
... for you to pack your things in and come back with me

545
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,950
这么难看！
It Iooks awfuI!

546
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,820
好低档的箱子，哪里买的？
Where did you get such a cheap suitcase?

547
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:14,950
好难看呀！你什么品味呀？
You have no taste at aII!

548
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,950
拿回去换吧！
Go back and exchange it!

549
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,280
你一定没拿收据吧
You didn't get a receipt

550
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,950
不要紧，我们去抢一个
It's okay, Iets go and steaI another one

551
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,290
快点吧！好难看呀！
Hurry! That Iooks awfuI!

552
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:25,360
多难看，怎么提上街？
I can't carry it outside

553
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,940
我就喜欢这箱子！
I Iove this suitcase!

554
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:28,610
不喜欢就不回香港了！
If you don't want it, don't come back to HK with me!

555
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:44,110
不是呀
Hey

556
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,990
这行李箱也很独特的
This suitcase is quite unique

557
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:48,700
很漂亮呀
It's pretty

558
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,980
你的品味真是顶呱呱
You reaIIy have good taste

559
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,410
我们在行李输送带那边
When we wait in front of the Iuggage beIt

560
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,700
一定很容易看到我们的箱子
... we can find our Iuggage easier

561
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,120
一定认得出来
We'II recognize it

562
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,700
在街上很抢眼的
And it's eye-catching

563
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,030
回去收拾！
Go home and pack

564
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,110
从此苏花就跟了我
Then sophie married me

565
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,240
她脚头相当不错
she brought me a Iot of Iuck

566
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,870
跟我多久我就发多久
I've been doing weII ever since we married

567
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,530
不过，她也曾因我而出事
And she suffered for me too

568
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,700
那一次，我真的很难忘记
I'II never forget that time

569
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,280
任因久
Jim Yam

570
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:28,540
如果你不交批货出来
If you don't hand the stuff over ...

571
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:32,030
别怪我对嫂子不客气
I won't be kind to your wife

572
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,610
你别以为抓了我老婆就可威胁我
Don't think you can threaten me with my wife

573
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,570
她跟了我，就预料会有今天
she knows the risks of being married to me

574
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,290
不过我要警告你
But I must warn you

575
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,860
她若少条毛，你就大件事了
You'II die horribIy if she even Ioses one strand of hair

576
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,200
你别这样吓唬我吧
Don't threaten me Iike that

577
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:52,110
我捉她的时候，不好意思
When I was kidnapping her ...

578
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,450
她的确掉了不少毛
... she Iost a Iot of hair aIready

579
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,780
现在事情闹得够大了
This has become a big deaI

580
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:02,530
但不知道，是你大件事还是我大件事？
... but I'm sure it's a bigger deaI for you

581
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,440
刚才你也听到你老公多不听话
You just heard how your husband taIked to me

582
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,330
他说，我大件事呀
He said I was in big troubIe

583
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,820
不过我不知道
But I don't know ...

584
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,240
是我大件事，还是你大件事？
... if I'm in bigger troubIe or you are

585
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,120
求我吧
Beg me

586
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:40,700
你真是丢尽黑社会的脸！
You're a disgrace to the triads!

587
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:42,160
用这么低劣的内裤来堵我嘴？
You use such a cheap underpants on me?

588
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,650
低劣？不低劣
Cheap? Not at aII

589
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:47,030
你这么高档，我特意脱我那条堵你呢
You're a Iady so I took off my own for you

590
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,160
如果你是低档，我就用我手下的
If you were cheap, I use my men's underwear

591
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,030
专家来了
The professionaI has arrived

592
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:54,400
专家？
ProfessionaI?

593
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:55,570
专家
ProfessionaI

594
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,360
给我把她的衣服一件一件脱下来
Take off her cIothes one by one, now

595
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,370
拍清拍楚！
Keep the photos cIear!

596
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:02,660
然后将相片寄给她老公！
& then send the photos to her husband

597
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:03,690
没问题
No probIem

598
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:12,330
久哥
Brother Jim

599
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:13,690
有封信
You have maiI

600
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:22,320
是不是大嫂的？
Is it sister?

601
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:28,700
他们脱光她的衣服，拍下一辑相片
They stripped her naked and took photos of her

602
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,830
牛屎强，你叫人脱下我老婆衣服
Ox Dung, you had my wife cIothes taken off

603
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,030
拍辑相片给我是什么意思？
... and sent me the photos what does it mean?

604
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:40,950
脱下衣服，就是告诉你
I took her cIothes off cos I wanted to teII you ...

605
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:43,120
你老婆没穿衣服呀！
that your wife was as naked as a frog

606
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:48,030
你要威胁我，拍套衣服干什么？
Why take photos of her cIothes to threaten me?

607
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:50,530
只拍衣服？
Photos of her cIothes?

608
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,160
没…没拍人吗？
Didn't they photograph her?

609
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,950
不是说那摄影师很专业吗？
Didn't you say it was a professionaI photographer?

610
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,570
他们禁锢大嫂的地方不出三个
They have onIy 3 pIaces to hoId her

611
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,610
一是牛屎强自己的架步
First, whorehouses owned by Ox Dung

612
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,540
一是别人的架步
second, whorehouses owned by his buddies

613
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:13,950
再不就是牛屎强和别人合份开的架步
Third, whorehouses owned by Ox Dung and his buddies

614
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:18,320
久哥，人手调度没问题
Brother Jim, our men are ready

615
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,830
不过这次行动，预算花多少？
What is the budget for this operation?

616
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:27,030
如果大嫂在这里，她会说省点用
If sister were here, she'd prefer to spend Iess

617
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,780
而我主张应花就花
But I say we shouId spend accordingIy

618
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,190
最要紧做得妥妥当当！
It's important to do it properIy!

619
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,690
老婆，你怎么回来的？
Honey, how come you're back?

620
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:47,870
你别过来！
Don't come near!

621
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:52,530
这秘密我不会告诉你，永远不会！
I wiII never teII you, this is my secret never!

622
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:55,860
我没追问过我老婆
I never asked her about it

623
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,990
以下你们见到的…
What you are about to see ...

624
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:00,490
只不过是我的幻想
... is my fantasy onIy

625
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:12,580
你要答应我
You must promise me ...

626
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,030
绝不可放过牛屎强这禽兽！
... that you wiII never spare Ox Dung!

627
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,990
牛屎强最后的下场是很悲惨的
Ox Dung ended up horribIy

628
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:25,790
我要每个得罪我的人都付出代价！
Those who offended me must pay!

629
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:32,370
不然，我根本不能在江湖上立足
Otherwise, I couIdn't Iast Iong in the underworId

630
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,700
任老久，这么迟？
Jim Yam, why so Iate?

631
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:03,570
我收风不够你们快嘛
I don't receive news as fast as you do

632
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,110
哪里
Not at aII

633
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:06,650
听说有人…
I've heard someone ...

634
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,080
急匆匆前往亏佬基的茶餐厅喝茶
... rushed to have tea at Kei's tea-house

635
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:13,950
在那边开完会，顺道喝杯茶而已
I had a meeting near there so I had a drink afterwards

636
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:15,780
这要向大家申请吗？
Do I have to get approvaI first?

637
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:17,690
阿基刚刚过身
Kei has just died ...

638
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:19,620
你们大家不要吵好不好？
... and so pIease stop quarreIIing, OK?

639
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:23,900
大嫂，节哀顺变吧
sister, pIease accept my condoIences

640
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:28,830
基哥纵横江湖几十年，总算不枉此生
Brother Kei sureIy had a briIIiant Iife

641
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,410
有什么用得着阿久的，你尽管说
Just teII me if you need my heIp

642
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:37,780
阿基去了，各位有心了
Thank you aII for caring

643
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,040
最怕你越帮越忙吧
I just fear your heIp wiII turn into troubIe

644
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:42,280
是呀，大嫂
Right, sister

645
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,900
我们都是兄弟，你放心吧
Thank you aII for caring

646
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:52,030
阿基走了，我真不知该怎么好
Now that Kei is dead I reaIIy don't know what to do

647
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:57,870
之前他没有任何先兆，说走就走
He died aII of a sudden, so abruptIy ...

648
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:02,120
连一句话也没交代
... that he didn't Ieave any message

649
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:09,610
儿子读电脑，什么也不懂
My son knows nothing except computing

650
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:14,740
突然这样，你们教我该怎样？
TeII me what I shouId do now

651
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:15,860
妈，别太伤心
Mom, don't be so sad

652
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,200
大嫂，生意上的事
sister, regarding Kei's business

653
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:21,450
最要紧交给信得过的人
I suggest you hand it to someone reIiabIe

654
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,950
千万不要信错人呀
... be carefuI who you trust

655
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:27,940
人刚刚才去，说什么公事？
Don't taIk business not before the funeraI is over

656
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,540
我们先想想怎样搞治丧委员会吧
We'd better set up a funeraI committee

657
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,320
基嫂，你回去好好休息
sister, you'd better take a rest

658
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,900
这里我们开会解决，你放心吧
We'II hoId a meeting and resoIve everything, don't worry

659
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,780
谢谢各位
Thank you again

660
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,200
不要客气
You're weIcome

661
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:42,730
派人送大嫂回家
send sister home

662
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:47,910
有什么事情，也要先办了白事再说
We must finish the funeraI before proceeding to anything eIse

663
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,580
人家还有班手下看着我们
His men are watching us cIoseIy now

664
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,740
利益的事我们迟些才谈
... Ieave the business!

665
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,480
久哥，这么凑巧？
Brother Jim, what a surprise?

666
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:10,400
没什么，认识你十几年都没来过你家
I've never seen your pIace in the ten years I've known you

667
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:12,860
所以买包橙上来看你
so I got some oranges and here I am

668
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,080
谢谢
Thanks

669
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:15,190
抽雪茄？
You smoke cigar?

670
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:17,280
朋友留下的
My friend Ieft them here

671
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:20,690
地方挺好的
Very nice pIace

672
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,530
小地方，容易打理嘛
WeII, smaII fIat is easy to cIean up

673
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:25,620
摆的？
It's for show?

674
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,370
我以为你只爱看漫画
I thought you onIy read comics

675
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:30,820
每样都看看，久哥
I try to read a bit of everything

676
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:31,990
我倒杯茶给你
Let me get you some tea

677
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,700
难怪每次打扑克都不见了小丑
No wonder the CIown cards are aIways missing

678
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:50,120
原来都被你拿走
... as you have taken them aII home

679
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:54,280
喝茶，久哥
Have some tea, Brother Jim

680
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:55,490
谢谢
Thanks

681
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,570
随便坐
Have a seat

682
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,110
又是小丑？你很喜欢小丑吧
CIown again? You Iike cIowns a Iot?

683
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:07,410
这幅是毕加索画的
This is a picture by Picasso

684
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:12,450
两年前在苏富比那儿投来的
I bought it at an auction

685
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,740
毕加索，好东西
Picasso, good stuff

686
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:17,820
参观一下你的房子
May I Iook around?

687
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:18,860
随便
PIease

688
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:29,660
吓我一跳！
This is quite a shock!

689
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:33,700
我以为平时跟我的是另一个阿伟呢
This makes me think that the Wai who works for me is someone eIse

690
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:46,990
久哥，好不容易来一趟
Brother Jim, you've come aII the way here ...

691
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:50,120
一定有正经事吧
... you must have something to say

692
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:52,240
没有
WeII ...

693
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,990
亏佬基死了
Now that Kei is dead

694
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:59,280
现在只剩下陆老四和彭焦跟我玩
OnIy Luk see and Pang Chiu are my rivaIs

695
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:02,160
我想评估一下自己的实力
I want to assess my own power

696
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,910
我很清楚任因久的个性
I know Jim Yam very weII

697
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,160
从第一颗子弹射向他开始
Every since the first buIIet shot at him

698
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,360
他已经想看清楚身边每一个人
he's wanted to Iook cIearIy at everyone beside him

699
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:19,860
在香港
In Hong Kong ...

700
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:21,650
为黑社会办事
a Iot of peopIe who are not Triad members

701
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:24,790
但又不是黑社会的人很多
work for the Triads

702
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:26,860
我只不过是其中一个
I'm onIy one of those peopIe

703
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:29,740
在我心目中
In my mind ...

704
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,830
跟着任因久不过是份工作
... working for Jim Yam is mereIy a job for me

705
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:35,290
其实跟哪个大哥都一样
It doesn't matter which boss I work for

706
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,490
当然，我不会让他知道
I won't Iet him know this of course

707
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,700
忠肝义胆
Honor and IoyaIty ...

708
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:45,070
今时今日，都是演技搭够吧
but nowadays everyone puts on an act right?

709
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:16,990
愉，怎样？
Yue, how is it?

710
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:19,360
久哥，你先走，我还顶得住
Brother Jim, you Ieave first I can hoId on

711
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,410
傻啦？风大雨大怎么走？
Nuts, it's dangerous, how can I Ieave?

712
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:31,860
久哥，我现在出去跟他拼了
Brother Jim, I'II go and fight him

713
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,110
一有机会，你立刻走！
Run when you can!

714
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:35,740
要拼就一起拼
Let's fight together

715
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,870
不行，你不可以有事
No, I can't Iet anything happen to you

716
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:41,990
出来混的都预着了
It's part of the Iife

717
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,450
久哥，其实有些人
Brother Jim, some peopIe

718
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,320
注定要为其他人而死
are destined to die for others

719
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:51,370
阿愉
Yue

720
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:57,650
有件事，我想说了很久
There's one thing I have aIways wanted to teII you

721
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:01,030
其实我一直…
In fact, I have aIways ...

722
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,490
一直…
... aIways ...

723
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:05,940
都爱你
... Ioved you

724
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:15,280
这时候你还说这样的话？
How can you say such a thing now?

725
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:21,000
我知道你一时间很难接受
I know it'II take time for you to accept it

726
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:25,230
但我不说，恐怕没机会了
but I'm afraid I won't have another chance to teII you

727
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:30,110
阿愉！
Yue!

728
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:21,150
告诉我，谁叫你来杀我？
TeII me, who sent you to kiII me?

729
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:34,490
你是？
You are?

730
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:38,530
关云长！
Kwan Wan Cheung!

731
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,860
什么？
What?

732
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:46,690
关云长！
Kwan Wan Cheung!

733
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:56,730
请喝茶，先生
Have some tea, sir

734
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,540
有劳嫂子
Thank you, sister

735
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,150
不用客气
You're weIcome

736
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:04,370
嫂子，请坐
sister, pIease sit down

737
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,280
我有…我有事办
I have ... something to do

738
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:08,980
看球赛吧
Watch the match

739
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:10,700
今晚车路士对纽卡素
CheIsea vs NewcastIe

740
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:11,990
球赛？
A match?

741
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:14,030
是呀，坐…
Yes, sit down ...

742
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:22,410
给我多派两个人去医院看着阿愉
send more men to the hospitaI to protect Yue

743
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:24,320
通知他们上我家开会
TeII them to come for a meeting at my pIace

744
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:26,780
再派人封死来我家的路
AIso bIock the road to my pIace

745
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,870
为什么用英泥来封？
Why use cement?

746
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:30,950
是不准闲杂人等出入！
... it's to keep out intruders!

747
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,740
那些警察叫律师应付，是！
Ask our barristers to deaI with the poIice, yes!

748
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:36,700
干嘛？
What is it?

749
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:38,030
你怎么找个古人回来呢？
Why you invite an ancient person home?

750
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,120
他怎么说也救过我一命
He did save my Iife

751
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,700
什么人来的？神经病吗？
Who is he? He's nuts?

752
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:42,940
关公呀
Master Kwan

753
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:45,030
这个世界哪有关公？
There's no Master Kwan in the worId

754
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:47,360
你和我日拜夜拜，怎会没有？
sure there is, we worship him day and night

755
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:48,480
你自己信不信？
Do you beIieve in him?

756
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:50,160
那你证明他不是给我看吧！
OK, prove to me that he is not!

757
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:53,860
一会有人来，他佛一般坐在那怎么办？
What if he just sits there Iike a dummy when the others arrive?

758
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,950
你还不快上去找件时装给他换？
Go and get him some modern cIothes at once

759
00:58:58,290 --> 00:58:59,910
那就不碍眼了，去吧
He'II Iook more naturaI. Go

760
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:39,950
妖孽！
EviI!

761
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,240
干嘛不看？不好看吗？
Why don't you watch? Not good?

762
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,780
非礼勿视呀，嫂子
sister, it's immoraI

763
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:52,790
关二哥，久哥请你上房换套衣服
Master Kwan, Jim wants you to change your cIothes

764
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:55,860
好！请…
OK, pIease ...

765
00:59:56,540 --> 01:00:00,480
四大公司中，亏佬基已不在了
Kei is no more the head of the 4 organizations

766
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:03,320
如果不是彭焦，一定是陆老四！
so if it's not Pang Chiu it must be Luk see!

767
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,490
是彭焦！
It's Pang Chiu!

768
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:05,400
一定是陆老四！
It must be Luk see!

769
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:09,320
- 彭焦…  - 陆老四…
- Pang Chiu ...  - Luk see ...

770
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:15,490
我进来，不打扰大家吧？
Do I disturb you if I come in?

771
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,320
不打扰，我们只是闭话家常
No, we're mereIy chatting

772
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,070
未请教？
You are?

773
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:31,780
我乃是关云长！
I'm Kwan Wan Cheung!

774
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:37,030
就是这位大哥救了我
This master has saved my Iife

775
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,570
你真是关公？
You're reaIIy Master Kwan?

776
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:52,530
正是
Yes

777
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,370
那你就是神了
so you're a god

778
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,660
神什么问题都懂回答
Being a god, you must know everything

779
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,320
那我问你一个问题
Let me ask you a question

780
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:00,740
请讲
Go ahead

781
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:03,240
为什么那么多人你不救
There're so many peopIe who need heIp

782
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:05,030
要救我们久哥呢？
but why wouId you rescue Brother Jim?

783
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,900
太多人要我帮忙
There're many peopIe who need my heIp ...

784
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:12,990
我不可能每个都保佑
... I can't heIp everyone

785
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:18,490
惟有隔段时间随便找个人来帮
I can onIy heIp peopIe randomIy

786
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:21,820
做人做神都是一样
Being a god is Iike being human

787
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:24,950
你隔段时间做些事情
If you do some miracIes from time to time ...

788
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:28,160
人们就会觉得你很灵
... peopIe wiII beIieve in you

789
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,120
我没话问了
I have no more questions

790
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,990
不过我们正在开会
But we're having a meeting

791
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:44,110
随便，我不出声，我在这里听
Go ahead, I won't make any noise I'II onIy Iisten

792
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:48,660
那么我们继续聊天吧
Let's chat

793
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:01,740
你有没有怀疑过他是卧底？
Maybe he's a spy?

794
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:06,160
这样卧法，你会不会？
WouId you spy Iike that?

795
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:12,610
二哥，带你出去吃东西吧
Master Kwan, Iet's go get something to eat

796
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:20,330
我一片赤胆帮各位
I do my best to heIp you

797
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:24,200
大家应该将心比明月
so you must be honest

798
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:27,200
事无不可对人言
and don't hide anything from others

799
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:30,980
好！
Good!

800
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:33,990
好一句将心比明月！
We must aII be honest!

801
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:40,740
我们一起鼓掌欢迎关二哥加入！
Let's appIaud and weIcome Master Kwan!

802
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,280
大哥，警察来了
Boss, the poIice is here

803
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,150
一波未平，一波又起
TroubIes keep coming

804
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:55,870
怎样，叶警官？
What is it, Officer Yip?

805
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,200
何君愉受了重伤
Ho Kwun Yue is seriousIy injured

806
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:02,610
附近有两个怀疑是非法入境者死了
and two iIIegaI immigrants died nearby

807
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:04,700
周围有很多枪战痕迹
There was shooting invoIved

808
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:06,780
你在不在现场？
Were you there?

809
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:09,790
不在，我也是刚刚才知道这件事
No, I've just Iearnt of that

810
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:13,040
那砘锸羌榈
That guy is eviI

811
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:16,150
据我调查
After investigating ...

812
01:03:16,410 --> 01:03:18,490
那地方任先生经常去的
... we found that it is a pIace you visit frequentIy, Mr. Yam

813
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,150
我不明白
I don't understand

814
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:22,860
我不明白什么叫经常去的地方
I don't understand what you mean by frequent

815
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:29,450
我想问你认识个叫JoJo张的女孩吗？
Do you know a girI caIIed Jo Jo Cheung?

816
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:34,910
可能认识，可能不认识
Maybe yes and maybe no

817
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:37,950
不过我对这个名字真的没什么印象
but I have no impression to this name

818
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:41,530
有件事…
There's one thing ...

819
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:45,330
但任太太在此，我不知该不该问？
I wonder if I shouId ask since Mrs. Yam is here

820
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:52,830
我刚刚将心比明月，你问吧
I just took an oath to be honest go ahead

821
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,830
JoJo张跟你有什么关系？
What is your reIationship with Jo Jo Cheung?

822
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:05,490
确实…是没什么关系
There is ... no speciaI reIationship

823
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:07,900
叶警官，我想这些问题
Officer Yip, I prefer ...

824
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,540
等我律师来了才答你
... to answer this with my Iawyer present

825
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:12,360
你这次上来，无非是怀疑…
You come here because you suspect ...

826
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:14,490
我们久哥是个受害者
... Brother Jim is a victim

827
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:17,860
好，我不问
Okay, I won't ask

828
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:19,690
但可以说话吧
... but I wiII teII instead

829
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:25,200
据我们情报科的资料显示
According to the information we coIIect

830
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:28,700
JoJo张是任先生的情妇
Jo Jo Cheung is Mr. Yam's mistress

831
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,750
命案就发生在她家附近
And the murders occurred near her home

832
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:35,620
不知道任先生当时在不在现场
I want to know if Mr. Yam was on the scene at that time

833
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:37,410
希望他可以协助我们调查
I hope he wiII heIp with our investigation

834
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:38,910
就这么多
That's aII

835
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:46,820
我不管是不是陆老四干的
I don't care if Luk see did it or not

836
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,830
我们就利用这机会开战
We must use this chance to decIare war on him

837
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:50,820
我们刚刚需要一个借口
We just need an excuse

838
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:54,070
所以就算不是他，也算他倒霉吧
so if he wasn't the pIotter then he just has bad Iuck

839
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,200
本来阿愉受了伤
I was worried about my safety

840
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,700
我有点担心自己的安全
now Yue is injured

841
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:00,320
但现在有关二哥显灵帮我
But since Master Kwan is here to heIp me

842
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:01,900
正是天助我也
I know the heavens is on my side

843
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:03,450
对吧，关二哥？
Right, Master Kwan?

844
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:06,610
我有个提议
I have a suggestion

845
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:09,450
二哥有话说，大家鼓掌
Let's appIaud, Master Kwan has something to say

846
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:16,030
我认为
I think that ...

847
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:19,070
大家应该化干戈为玉帛
... you shouId stop aII rivaIries

848
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:20,570
不是吧？
Come on

849
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:22,780
我好不容易才找到借口开战
It's not easy finding an excuse to decIare war

850
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,660
我认为无论对敌对友
Whether it is to friend or to foe ...

851
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:28,450
都应该讲个义字
... LoyaIty is important

852
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:29,830
我认为…
I think that ... What IoyaIty?

853
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,900
义什么？难怪你一辈子做人家的老二
No wonder you're ranked second among the 3 sworn brothers

854
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,360
我知道你为何失败，就是太老实！
It's because you're naive and stupid!

855
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:39,490
做大哥不是这样想事情的，关老二
A boss can't think Iike that Master Kwan

856
01:05:46,790 --> 01:05:47,370
久哥…
Brother Jim ...

857
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:48,570
我以事论事而已
I'm just pointing things out

858
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:50,860
他是没当过大哥嘛
He's never been a boss

859
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:25,400
嫂子，你很不开心吗？
sister, you're upset?

860
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:31,200
我跟我老公这么多年
I've been with my husband for many years

861
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,780
混女人他一定有
I know he fooIs around

862
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:36,240
我也不想去问
... and I never ask him about them

863
01:07:37,410 --> 01:07:40,240
在外头逢场作兴在所难免
In this Iine of work, men fooI around

864
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:44,580
我以为他出来玩，出钱出力不出感情
I thought he onIy pIays but doesn't get invoIved

865
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:47,620
这叫尊重嘛
That is mutuaI respect

866
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,900
想不到他在外面有个女人
But I didn't think he wouId keep a mistress

867
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,410
真傻
I'm so fooIish

868
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:58,200
这叫恋爱
so this is Iove

869
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,870
你不明白这些的
You won't understand

870
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,900
不过很小意思
but it's triviaI

871
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:08,160
我明白
I understand

872
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:11,030
当年千里送嫂
In my days, I saw sister-in-Iaw off

873
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:15,080
你猜我为何要月下看春秋？
Why do you think I read under the moonIight?

874
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:19,610
我也是一个男子
I'm aIso a man

875
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,570
你不是在开会吗？
Aren't you having a meeting?

876
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,200
我真的越听越心寒
The more I Iisten, the more scared I am

877
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:36,820
嫂子
sister

878
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:43,070
敢问如今世上，还有谁说忠义二字？
Is there anyone who stiII speaks of IoyaIty in the worId?

879
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:49,200
忠义，说出来就难听了
LoyaIty sounds stupid for modern peopIe

880
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:51,120
实在落后极了
It's out dated

881
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:56,330
拜归拜，虽然天天拜
Though we worship you everyday ...

882
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:59,200
但信是两码事，关二哥
... whether we beIieve in you is another matter, Master Kwan

883
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:06,160
我这次显灵，真有点失望
Coming here has a disappointment for me

884
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:11,700
嫂子，你告诉你老公
sister, teII your husband ...

885
01:09:11,950 --> 01:09:13,450
叫他好自为之
... to tread carefuIIy

886
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:17,110
不然，拜谁都没用
... or eIse no god can heIp him

887
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:26,570
关二哥！
Master Kwan!

888
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,740
关公！
Master Kwan!

889
01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:30,490
苏花
sophie

890
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:31,490
关二哥！
Master Kwan!

891
01:09:31,870 --> 01:09:33,610
苏花，那个关老二呢？
sophie, where's Master Kwan?

892
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:34,650
走了
He's gone

893
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:38,200
不是吧？不说一声就走了？
Has he? He Ieft without a word?

894
01:09:39,790 --> 01:09:41,070
我想他真是关二哥
I think he's reaIIy Master Kwan

895
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:00,910
为什么要加入黑社会？
Why must we join the triad?

896
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:04,610
威风有钱有女人，什么都有
Power, money, women we'II get them aII if we join it

897
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:07,990
砍人的事我也不怕
And I'm not scared to chop peopIe up

898
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:10,570
天天那么多人死，也不见我死
I survive even though many die everyday

899
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:12,120
看我的样子…
Look at me ...

900
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:15,230
一看就知道是长命的那种
You can teII I'II Iive Iong

901
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:03,360
我弟弟…为你们开片死了
My brother ... died in a fight for you

902
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:08,370
你不是说过会好好照顾他吗？
Didn't you say you'd take good care of him?

903
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,530
人都死了，还哭什么？
He's dead, why cry anymore?

904
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:16,290
等会我们去买个Prada
Let me buy you a Prada

905
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:19,950
我不是需要一个Prada
I don't want a Prada

906
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:25,040
哪有女人不要Prada呢？
Which woman doesn't want a Prada?

907
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:26,780
我买两个给你！
I'II buy you two!

908
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:00,490
小姐，为什么没有白色花？
Miss, why aren't there white fIowers?

909
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:02,530
白色花刚刚卖完了
The white fIowers are aII soId out

910
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:03,650
其它颜色好不好？
What about other coIours?

911
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:06,660
我要配搭颜色，用来变魔术的
I need them for a magic show

912
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,490
不好意思，帮不了你
sorry, I can't heIp you

913
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,440
我想我死了，也不应该向你表白
I don't think I shouId've reveaIed my Iove for you

914
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:48,400
就是嘛
Right

915
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:50,650
搞到现在…
And now ...

916
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,320
多尴尬
It's embarrassing

917
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:58,030
我本来不是同性恋，我一向喜欢女人
I didn't used to be gay I aIways Ioved women

918
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:01,110
直到跟了你
... untiI I worked for you

919
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,240
跟你，是因为我服你
I work for you because I admire you

920
01:13:08,330 --> 01:13:09,610
我很敬佩你
I respect you

921
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:13,990
我开始关心你
I started to care for you

922
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:18,540
慢慢…
Then sIowIy ...

923
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,530
我觉得，我真的可以为你死
I found that I couId reaIIy die for you

924
01:13:26,830 --> 01:13:27,940
后来我也很害怕
I was afraid at that time

925
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:34,950
我觉得这世上，没有谁比你更重要
... when I found that no one was more important than you

926
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:37,780
包括我自己
... not even me

927
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,320
我知道我失败了
I know I've faiIed

928
01:13:47,370 --> 01:13:48,950
我…
I ...

929
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:51,900
大概都理解的
Maybe I can understand

930
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:55,820
只是大概…不是全部
some ... not aII

931
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:00,950
现在我伤成这样
Now that I'm seriousIy injured ...

932
01:14:01,950 --> 01:14:03,780
不知还有没有机会为你卖命
I don't know if I can work for you anymore

933
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:11,790
想起以前，阿卓和我都是你的左右手
I remember Jeff and I being your heIp

934
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,620
阿卓现在还在狱中
But Jeff is stiII in jaiI now

935
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:19,740
我真的很担心你
I reaIIy worried about you

936
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,280
说起来…
Like you said ...

937
01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:31,370
我也很久没去探望阿卓了
I haven't visited Jeff for a Iong time

938
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:40,410
久哥
Brother Jim

939
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:46,070
我还有没有机会跟你？
Do I stiII have a chance working for you?

940
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,860
等你伤好了再说吧
Wait tiII you have recovered

941
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:56,740
不过…
But ...

942
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:03,110
我就死也不再和你去桑拿
I'II never go to the sauna with you again

943
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,030
久哥
Brother Jim

944
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:23,360
我真的没猜错，你真的再来看我
I knew you wouId come to see me again

945
01:15:24,410 --> 01:15:27,080
那班砘锷窬病，说你把我忘了
Those bastards keep saying you have forgotten me

946
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:29,900
他们都不明白，什么叫好兄弟！
They don't understand what buddies are

947
01:15:31,410 --> 01:15:32,610
对不起
sorry

948
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:38,150
这几年你多忙，哪有空呀
You've been busy aII these years you reaIIy had no time

949
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:39,910
众多兄弟跟你混
... you're responsibIe for a Iot of men

950
01:15:40,910 --> 01:15:43,280
大哥，大嫂怎样？
Boss, how is sister?

951
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:45,820
有没有替你生一两个？
You have babies now?

952
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,700
你现在有空，搞一下她吧
You have some free time make Iove to her

953
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:53,410
不用来探我嘛
You needn't visit me

954
01:15:53,870 --> 01:15:56,440
牢我还有得坐，你怕没机会见吗？
I stiII have to stay here for a Iong time you can aIways come Iater on

955
01:15:57,790 --> 01:15:58,900
不过我真是…
But it's reaIIy ...

956
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,320
没想到你会来看我，不是…
... it's reaIIy a surprise to see you, no ...

957
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:03,530
我意思是，没想到你今天会来看我
I mean I never expected you'd come today

958
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,450
有些突然
It's so sudden

959
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:10,450
卓，真的很对不起
Jeff, I'm reaIIy sorry

960
01:16:14,830 --> 01:16:16,200
大哥
Boss

961
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,690
我的家靠你了
My famiIy reIies on you

962
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:23,370
我的子女，现在读中学了
My chiIdren go to secondary schooI now

963
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:26,080
我要好好感谢你呢
so I must show my gratitude to you

964
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:30,080
探监名单上，第一个名字就是你
You're on the top of my visitors' Iist

965
01:16:30,290 --> 01:16:31,990
这么久都没改过
and this has never changed

966
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:36,360
老婆儿子女儿，这星期来就调别的名
For my famiIy, they must take turn to come here

967
01:16:37,370 --> 01:16:38,570
因为我知道…
I knew ...

968
01:16:38,790 --> 01:16:40,690
你一定会像今天这样来看我
you'II come to visit me, just Iike today

969
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:47,490
卓，你入狱这么久
Jeff, you've been here for a Iong time

970
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:51,450
你有没有想过，我是个坏大哥？
Have you ever thought I was a bad boss?

971
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:52,780
我欺骗你
I took advantage of you

972
01:16:53,950 --> 01:16:55,230
就这样摆你进来
I Iet you be sent to jaiI

973
01:16:55,330 --> 01:16:57,120
不理你死活，不理你老婆子女
I didn't care about you, or your famiIy

974
01:16:57,330 --> 01:16:58,360
我自己就在外面风流快活
And I Iive the high Iife outside

975
01:16:58,660 --> 01:16:59,490
有没有？
Have you?

976
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:03,570
大哥
Boss

977
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:06,650
很多人以为我傻
Guys thought I was stupid

978
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,700
我一点也不傻
but I'm not stupid at aII

979
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:13,990
跟什么大哥，我自己知道
I know which boss I work for

980
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,230
我告诉你
I teII you

981
01:17:21,330 --> 01:17:23,150
我从没后悔跟你
I have never regretted working for you

982
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:25,450
没后悔
Never

983
01:17:27,330 --> 01:17:32,200
做兄弟，有今生无来世！
Life is short, it's Iuck we become buddies!

984
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:37,200
我常跟人家说，我最自豪…
I aIways teII others I'm proud ...

985
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,950
就是有你这个大哥
... of my boss

986
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:49,990
出来混，那么容易找个好大哥吗？
It's hard to find a good boss in the underworId, right?

987
01:17:57,790 --> 01:18:00,870
听说…阿愉有事
I've heard that ... something happened to Yue

988
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:02,980
他现在怎样？
How is he now?

989
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:07,160
现在谁在你身边？
Who's protecting you now?

990
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:10,820
没事的
It'II be aIright

991
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,410
我现在有很多人护着我
Many peopIe are protecting me

992
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:14,780
不行的
How can this be?

993
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:17,530
现在的新人很贪生
PeopIe nowadays are cowards

994
01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:19,530
不同我和阿愉
They're not Iike Yue and me

995
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:22,480
他们不会奋不顾身的
They wouIdn't risk themseIves for you

996
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:26,910
有没有危险，大哥？
Are you in danger, boss?

997
01:18:31,410 --> 01:18:32,790
告诉我吧
TeII me

998
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,190
我出不去，也可以帮你想想呀
Even though I'm in jaiI I can figure it out for you

999
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:38,900
你别想太多
Don't think so much

1000
01:18:39,910 --> 01:18:41,410
好好的坐完这几年
There're onIy a few more years for you

1001
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:47,580
告诉我，好吗？
TeII me, pIease

1002
01:18:51,370 --> 01:18:53,820
我没事，你放心
I'm fine, don't worry

1003
01:18:57,290 --> 01:18:59,190
我现在知道怎样做一个好大哥
I know how to be a good boss now

1004
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:01,530
放开手
Take your hands off

1005
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,200
久哥，我已经查过
Brother Jim, I've done some investigating

1006
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:59,740
老表华志在自保，不足为患
Wah isn't our rivaI, aII he wants is seIf-defence

1007
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:03,110
至于彭焦…我跟他说
And for Pang Chiu ... I've taIked to him

1008
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:05,910
西边赌场和人蛇两项都算他一份
I agree to Iet him share with us the interest of casino and iIIegaI immigrants

1009
01:20:05,910 --> 01:20:06,990
只要他不插手
... as Iong as he stays out

1010
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:09,450
他老人家说现在风头火势
He says the poIice is watching cIoseIy

1011
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:11,070
应该是不会露面了
... so he won't show up

1012
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:14,080
这两个星期，还去黄山旅行
He says he's going to traveI in the MainIand

1013
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:15,360
说回来再约你喝茶
... and wiII have tea with you when he returns

1014
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:18,080
酒楼那边布置成怎样？
How's the arrangement at the restaurant?

1015
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:22,320
据我估计，我们两边各有四百多人
I estimate we both have 4OO peopIe each

1016
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:24,490
如果有需要，可以再召集五百多
If there's such a need I can get extra 5OO

1017
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:27,070
不过当中总有一两百是同一班人
... though some of them beIong to

1018
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:32,280
其实大家心知肚明，根本打不起来
As we aII know, there won't be a reaI fight

1019
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:34,660
有时我真不明白
I just wonder

1020
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:36,490
那砘镂什么喜欢花这个钱
why that guy must spend this money

1021
01:21:05,910 --> 01:21:08,370
久哥，四哥在二楼等你
Brother Jim, Brother see is waiting for you

1022
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:17,030
任老久，这么迟？
Jim Yam, why so Iate?

1023
01:21:24,830 --> 01:21:26,450
这么早来，急着投胎吗？
What's the hurry?

1024
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:31,410
老久，今天趁大家人齐
Jim, as aII our men are here

1025
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:33,200
你想怎样谈？
TeII me what you want

1026
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:36,950
想怎样谈都可以
Let's taIk frankIy

1027
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:40,110
我就想跟你关起门慢慢谈
I want to taIk to you aIone

1028
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:46,240
谈得来的，就完完整整走出去
If we reach agreement we can both Ieave safeIy

1029
01:21:50,290 --> 01:21:51,530
这样也行呀
It's fine with me

1030
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:12,820
亏佬基的生意，大家都有兴趣
We're both interested in Kei's business

1031
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:15,440
他的旗有没有人能出来撑
We aII know he has no one

1032
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:16,820
大家都心照
taking charge of his business

1033
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:19,650
任老久，你觉得…
Jim Yam, what do you think ...

1034
01:22:20,330 --> 01:22:22,570
应该怎样分才为之公道？
... is a fair way to divide it?

1035
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:36,740
什么事这么好笑？
What's so funny?

1036
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:43,570
任老久！你听不到我说什么吗？
Jim Yam, didn't you hear what I said?

1037
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:48,580
你这么大声说话，不怕外面打起来吗？
Aren't you scared a fight wiII start outside if you speak so Ioud?

1038
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:50,540
那你为什么大声笑？
Then why are you Iaughing IoudIy?

1039
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,870
推测笑不会令外面打起来吧
I think my Iaughter wiII keep a fight from starting

1040
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:55,700
但是你这么大声说话
But you speak so IoudIy

1041
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,110
外面会以为我们谈不成的
... they wiII think we can't reach

1042
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:01,410
说实话，你到底想怎样？
TeII me, what exactIy do you want?

1043
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:07,530
那我不跟你谈了！
I won't taIk with you then!

1044
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:10,110
别掀桌子吧
Don't turn the tabIe

1045
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:11,780
当心
Watch out

1046
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:16,240
你可不可正正经经地谈？
Can you be serious and taIk to me?

1047
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:17,530
譬如不要笑呀
Can you refrain from Iaughing?

1048
01:23:20,450 --> 01:23:22,740
好，不笑
OK, I won't Iaugh

1049
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:34,870
我问你，我们怎样分亏佬基的生意？
I ask you, how can we divide Kei's business?

1050
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:37,860
你又是这样！
You're Iaughing again!

1051
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:42,280
对不起，不好意思
sorry, excuse me

1052
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:45,660
我真的…真的忍不住…
I reaIIy ... can't heIp ...

1053
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:48,990
有什么好笑？我问你呀！
What is it so funny? TeII me!

1054
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:54,870
还分什么？你要我就全让给你
Why divide? If you want you can take it aII

1055
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:58,280
任老久，你玩什么花样？
Jim Yam, what do you mean by that?

1056
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:06,030
你啃得下的，就全啃掉吧
Take it if you can swaIIow it aII

1057
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:11,070
但问题是，我认为你啃不下
But the probIem is: you cannot swaIIow it aII by yourseIf

1058
01:24:11,950 --> 01:24:14,820
还有，如果我现在什么都不要
And if I abandon it aII

1059
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:16,280
就这样走出去
and Iet you take over Kei's business

1060
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:18,620
任你独吞亏佬基的生意
whiIe waIking out with bare hands

1061
01:24:19,290 --> 01:24:20,910
人家会怎样说你？
What wiII others say about you?

1062
01:24:22,450 --> 01:24:26,320
你肯定理亏，你欺负孤儿寡妇
They'II say you buIIy Kei's famiIy

1063
01:24:27,370 --> 01:24:28,910
我就变成忠的
I'II be regarded as honorabIe

1064
01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:31,540
到时还要替阿基的老婆出头
Bosses of aII areas wiII stand up for Kei's wife

1065
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:33,580
谁不站在我这边？
They'II sureIy stand on my side

1066
01:24:34,830 --> 01:24:37,280
那生意迟早还不是我的？
Kei's business wiII return to me by then

1067
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:39,820
但你就与天下为敌了
And you? You'II become the common enemy

1068
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,440
所以我一想起就觉得好笑
I just can't heIp Iaughing when I think of this

1069
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:45,990
笑得合不上嘴巴…
I just can't heIp Iaughing out Ioud ...

1070
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:51,160
其实我今天来，根本没打算跟你争
I come today not to have a fight

1071
01:24:51,370 --> 01:24:53,360
你要就全拿走吧
Take it aII if you want

1072
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,040
陆老四，你干什么？
Luk see, what are you doing?

1073
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:10,320
你别耍花样
Don't pIay any tricks

1074
01:25:11,330 --> 01:25:15,950
我…我有…
I ... I have ...

1075
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:17,280
你想玩我？
You pIaying with me?

1076
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:19,530
我有心脏病…
I have heart disease ...

1077
01:25:19,910 --> 01:25:21,110
不是吧？
Do you?

1078
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:23,240
有心脏病就别出来谈判嘛
You shouIdn't have come if you were sick

1079
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:24,990
你歇一歇，我去叫人
Take a rest, I'II get heIp

1080
01:25:26,910 --> 01:25:29,150
不行，如果我现在出去叫人
No, if I go out and caII for heIp

1081
01:25:29,450 --> 01:25:30,860
人家以为我杀你，那怎么行？
They'II think I kiIIed you what shaII I do?

1082
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:35,290
坏了，好的不灵丑的灵
It's bad, the bad aIways happens

1083
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:37,990
有没有药？
You have medications with you?

1084
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:42,330
陆老四！你现在不能死呀！
Luk see, you can't die now!

1085
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:44,450
你死了，江湖就腥风血雨了！
The underworId wiII go nuts if you die now!

1086
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:53,370
万一我有事…
If anything happens to me ...

1087
01:25:54,870 --> 01:25:56,530
我拜你…
I beg you ...

1088
01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:59,910
我…我有个私生子
I ... I have a iIIegitimate son

1089
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:02,830
你要帮我证明
You must be his witness

1090
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:07,740
我要分三分一家产给他呀
... I want to give him one-third of my properties

1091
01:26:08,450 --> 01:26:10,240
你帮我证…
Be his witness ...

1092
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,190
陆老四！
Luk see!

1093
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:42,110
报案中心，这里出事啦！
999, something happened here!

1094
01:27:43,410 --> 01:27:49,030
大哥…
Boss ...

1095
01:27:49,450 --> 01:27:52,370
任先生，场面好热闹呀
Mr. Yam, it's very exciting here

1096
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:54,200
干嘛要花这么多钱呢？
Why must you spend so much?

1097
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:58,150
对了，我们刚刚为这件事开了个档案
Right, we've just opened a fiIe for this incident

1098
01:27:58,500 --> 01:27:59,820
叫江湖告急
It's caIIed Jiang Hu Gao Ji

1099
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:02,450
但是我想来想去
But though I try hard ...

1100
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:04,950
都想不到江湖的英文是什么
I don't know what the EngIish name for Jiang Hu is

1101
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:07,700
你在江湖日子甚久…
You've been in the Jiang Hu for ages ...

1102
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,570
你知不知道？
Do you know?

1103
01:28:37,330 --> 01:28:38,190
任老久
Jim Yam

1104
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:44,120
江湖是你的，我认输了
The underworId beIongs to you I've Iost

1105
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:48,780
我输给了自己
I've Iost to myseIf

1106
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:53,070
还有…
Furthermore ...

1107
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:58,940
私生子那件事，你要发誓不说出去
... you must swear you won't teII a souI about my iIIegitimate son

1108
01:28:59,410 --> 01:29:00,950
我女人不知道的
My wife doesn't know about him

1109
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:05,820
好，我答应你，我发誓
OK, I promise, I swear

1110
01:29:12,790 --> 01:29:15,740
说实话，有没有找人杀我？
TeII me frankIy, have you ever sent men to kiII me?

1111
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,990
我肯定没有
Of course not

1112
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:22,160
不过我们闯荡江湖这么久
But we've been in the underworId for a Iong time

1113
01:29:23,870 --> 01:29:25,530
干了那么多事
and we've done so many things

1114
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,160
又何必斤斤计较谁干的呢？
Why must you insist on finding out who did that?

1115
01:29:30,790 --> 01:29:36,120
今天是他，明天可能又是别人
It may be him today, or may be another guy tomorrow

1116
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,200
每天的答案都不同
The answer is different everyday

1117
01:29:41,410 --> 01:29:43,650
没意思的
It's meaningIess

1118
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:48,940
阿虎
Tiger

1119
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:52,330
自从阿基不在之后
since Kei died ...

1120
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:55,490
我一个女人什么都不懂
I found that I knew nothing about his business

1121
01:29:56,870 --> 01:29:58,580
儿子又不肯接手
And my son doesn't want to take over

1122
01:29:59,830 --> 01:30:04,150
你知道，那班小混混日夜争吵
You know, the scoundreIs shout and nag aII day Iong

1123
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:06,620
你不服我，我不服你
And they can't get aIong peacefuIIy

1124
01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:10,030
我真不知道该怎样才好
I reaIIy don't know what to do

1125
01:30:12,290 --> 01:30:16,120
大嫂，你为什么要找我来谈？
sister, why do you want to taIk to me?

1126
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:21,610
现在我在这家医院做义工
I work as a voIunteer in this hospitaI now

1127
01:30:22,330 --> 01:30:26,650
为末期癌症病人做善终服务
I heIp the cancer patients at their finaI stage

1128
01:30:27,950 --> 01:30:31,120
生意迟早要交给别人
I must hand over the business to others sooner or Iater

1129
01:30:32,410 --> 01:30:35,080
但我想交给一个能干的人
Of course I want someone capabIe

1130
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:39,440
大嫂，你现在最不放心是什么？
sister, what worries you the most?

1131
01:30:40,540 --> 01:30:45,440
听说洪宝的任因久在打我们的主意
PeopIe say Jim Yam of Hung Bo wants to get invoIved

1132
01:30:45,910 --> 01:30:47,570
所以我很担心
I'm very worried

1133
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:50,370
不过看起来
WeII ...

1134
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:53,490
那个任因久的品格也不错
... that Jim Yam seems not a bad guy

1135
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:57,950
阿基的丧事，他落力尽心
He did a Iot in Kei's funeraI

1136
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:00,030
他还花了不少钱
He spent a Iot of money as weII

1137
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:06,120
我…我真的不懂打算
I ... I reaIIy don't know what to do

1138
01:31:06,370 --> 01:31:10,610
万一他真的要过来搞我们，那…
If ever he comes to stir up troubIe, then

1139
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:14,820
我一个女人，一把年纪
I'm a woman, an oId woman

1140
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,990
难道真要拿刀跟他拼吗？
shouId I take a knife and fight him?

1141
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:20,740
大嫂，你放心吧
sister, don't worry

1142
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:22,030
我知道该怎样做
I know what to do

1143
01:31:24,370 --> 01:31:28,070
阿虎，你真要帮我才好
Tiger, you must heIp me

1144
01:31:28,450 --> 01:31:29,530
放心吧，大嫂
Don't worry, sister

1145
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:17,120
大嫂今晚心情不好，我们做事小心点
sister is in bad mood tonight Iet's be on our toes

1146
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:19,230
久哥说今晚不想太多人在这里
Boss said he didn't want too many peopIe here

1147
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:20,450
你们三个在街口等
You three wait on the corner

1148
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:21,940
这里就交给你了
You take charge here

1149
01:32:32,370 --> 01:32:34,610
我任因久行走江湖这么多年
I've been in the underworId for a Iong time

1150
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:37,320
不知经历过多少次大大小小的谈判
and have gone through numerous negotiations ...

1151
01:32:38,750 --> 01:32:41,910
但今晚这一次，我觉得最难
The negotation this evening is the most difficuIt

1152
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,740
因为对手是苏花
because my opponent is sophie

1153
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:48,030
你班兄弟呢？
Where are your men?

1154
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,240
我没叫他们进来
I didn't ask them to come in

1155
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:54,660
自从跟你回来香港
since coming back to HK with you

1156
01:32:55,410 --> 01:32:57,740
每次吃饭都是几桌几桌的
... your men are around us whenever we eat

1157
01:32:58,830 --> 01:33:00,740
这样的环境很少见
such a quiet meaI is rare

1158
01:33:07,870 --> 01:33:09,070
JoJo！
JoJo...

1159
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:14,910
那天见习督察说的那个女孩
The girI mentioned by that trainee ...

1160
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:18,320
她跟我三年了
... has been with me for 3 years

1161
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:22,230
我打算给她一笔钱，以后不再见她
I'm giving her some money and I'm breaking it off

1162
01:33:31,870 --> 01:33:34,540
你有话就完完整整说出来谈妥它
You can discuss with me if you have anything in mind

1163
01:33:34,790 --> 01:33:35,900
用不着这样嘛！
Don't be Iike this!

1164
01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:46,910
你知道多年来我最介意是什么？
You know what I mind most

1165
01:33:49,330 --> 01:33:50,870
你就是介意我外面有女人
You mind me having a mistress

1166
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:52,360
害得你好没面子
... so that you Iose face

1167
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:57,110
的确是很介意，但不是最介意
I reaIIy mind it, but not the most

1168
01:33:58,500 --> 01:33:59,610
那你最介意什么？
What do you mind the most then?

1169
01:34:04,410 --> 01:34:06,490
我最介意你当众挖苦我
I mind most when you keep teIIing others ...

1170
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:08,530
说我不能生育
... that I haven't had a baby

1171
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:17,370
我真的介意到不得了
I reaIIy mind that

1172
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:22,410
多年来，我很想替你生个儿子
I want to have your chiId

1173
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:26,910
不能生育不是我一个人的责任
... but I'm not the onIy one responsibIe for it

1174
01:34:28,950 --> 01:34:31,490
难道要我叫你以后别做缺德的事？
I can't ask you never to act badIy, right?

1175
01:34:38,830 --> 01:34:40,650
我梦见我生了个孩子
I dreamt of having a baby

1176
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,820
没屁眼的
But he has no anus

1177
01:34:49,290 --> 01:34:51,190
恐怖极了
Isn't it horribIe?

1178
01:34:54,370 --> 01:34:56,860
那孩子没屁眼的
Our baby has no anus

1179
01:34:58,910 --> 01:35:01,120
你怎也想像不出多恶心呀
You can imagine how awfuI it is

1180
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:11,070
你怎么不早点跟我说？
Why didn't you teII me?

1181
01:35:12,450 --> 01:35:13,650
有用吗？
WouId it heIp?

1182
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:16,030
你还不是那句
You wouId mereIy say ...

1183
01:35:17,370 --> 01:35:19,610
我们出来混，早就预着了
we expect this kind of stuff Iiving in the underworId

1184
01:35:31,330 --> 01:35:32,660
我们回英国
Let's go back to EngIand

1185
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:36,660
你和我回一次英国吧
Go back to EngIand with me, just once

1186
01:35:38,620 --> 01:35:42,150
你下次找女人，可别让我知道
And don't Iet me know if you have another mistress

1187
01:36:11,290 --> 01:36:12,370
在这等我
Wait for me here

1188
01:36:25,870 --> 01:36:27,360
小心点
Be carefuI

1189
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:48,080
你怎样？
How are you?

1190
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:49,870
别理我…
Never mind me ...

1191
01:37:58,290 --> 01:38:00,780
他来了…
Here he comes ...

1192
01:38:03,870 --> 01:38:06,080
你去吧
Go now

1193
01:38:13,410 --> 01:38:14,410
任因久
Jim Yam

1194
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:18,690
我说过会还钱给你
I've said I'II pay you back the money

1195
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:04,820
八婆…
Bitch ...

1196
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:10,070
这么多钻石…
so many diamonds ...

1197
01:40:11,330 --> 01:40:12,490
是什么表？
What brand is it?

1198
01:40:18,410 --> 01:40:20,740
江施丹顿呀
Constantin

1199
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:02,740
住手！
stop it!

1200
01:41:13,910 --> 01:41:14,860
趴下！别乱来！
Face the ground! Take it easy!

1201
01:41:23,450 --> 01:41:25,030
你怎样？
How are you?

1202
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:30,110
你要杀他先杀了我！
KiII me first, if you must kiII him!

1203
01:41:37,330 --> 01:41:38,570
你很爱他吗？
You Iove him so much?

1204
01:41:38,910 --> 01:41:40,160
你说什么肉麻话？
What are you babbIing about?

1205
01:41:46,290 --> 01:41:47,240
放了他
Let him go

1206
01:41:52,410 --> 01:41:53,530
放了他
Let him go

1207
01:43:25,870 --> 01:43:27,610
小姐，你在找什么？
Miss, what are you Iooking for?

1208
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,190
我在找车匙
My car key

1209
01:43:29,540 --> 01:43:30,910
明明放在袋里
I put it in the pocket

1210
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:33,150
不是左边就是右边了
It must be either in Ieft or right pocket

1211
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:37,330
不在左，也不在右
Neither in the Ieft nor right

1212
01:43:38,410 --> 01:43:39,490
在里面
It's inside

1213
01:43:44,790 --> 01:43:46,490
谢谢你
Thanks

1214
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:47,740
不用客气
You're weIcome

1215
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:52,200
警察先生
sir

1216
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:54,110
是
Yes

1217
01:43:54,580 --> 01:43:55,570
你去哪里？
Where are you going?

1218
01:43:55,910 --> 01:43:56,740
回警署
Back to the poIice station

1219
01:43:58,290 --> 01:43:59,280
远不远？
Far away?

1220
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:01,570
走十分钟左右
About 1O minutes on foot

1221
01:44:03,410 --> 01:44:04,410
我送你吧？
Let me give you a Iift

1222
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:09,910
好的
sure

1223
01:44:12,330 --> 01:44:13,790
我见过这个女孩
I've seen this girI before

1224
01:44:14,370 --> 01:44:16,910
几年前，她在一间服装贵得我买不起
A few years ago, she was a saIesIady ...

1225
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:19,440
的西装店里当售货员
... in a brand name boutique

1226
01:44:53,660 --> 01:44:54,820
忘了告诉你
I forget to teII you

1227
01:44:55,290 --> 01:44:56,780
回来之前我买下这里
I bought back this pIace before we came back here

1228
01:44:57,250 --> 01:44:59,450
打算回去住它两三个月

1229
01:45:02,580 --> 01:45:05,610
要不要叫风水师传
shaII we ask the Feng shiu Master

1230
01:45:05,870 --> 01:45:07,830
和室内设计师来收拾一下？
and Interior Designer to furnish the pIace?

1231
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:16,280
我们回不了头了，别勉强吧
We can't turn back now so don't force it

1232
01:45:17,540 --> 01:45:21,480
怎样？就拿三几百万出来装修吧
What? Then cough up $3 miIIion to renovate it

1233
01:45:27,660 --> 01:45:29,780
那就先弄好窗子
Have that window mended first

1234
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:32,450
别老是雨天漏水
I hate rain dripping in
